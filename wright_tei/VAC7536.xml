PREFACE.&#xD;
Some meu are daily dying; some die ere they hrave&#xD;
learned how to live; and some find their truest accom4n&#xD;
in revealing the mysteries of both life and death,--even&#xD;
while they themselves perish in the act of revelation,&#xD;
as is most wonderfully done in the remarkable volume&#xD;
nowbefore the reader,-as, alas ! almost seems to be&#xD;
the case with the penman of what herein follows.&#xD;
The criterion of the value of a man or woman is the&#xD;
kind and amount Qf good they do or have. done. The&#xD;
standard whereby to judge a thinker, consists in the&#xD;
mental treasures which during life they heap up for the&#xD;
useand benefit of the age that is, and those which are&#xD;
to be, when the fitful fever of their own sorrowful lives&#xD;
shall be ended, and they have passed away to begin in&#xD;
stern reality their dealings with the dead. He or she&#xD;
who adds 'even one new thought to the age becomes&#xD;
that age's great benefactor, to whom in future times&#xD;
grateful men shall erect monuments and statues. Well,&#xD;
here follows the work of a. man, for his hand penned&#xD;

every line, and the ideas were born of. his soul, not-&#xD;
withstanding his own disclaimer, for not every one can&#xD;
understand the mystical Blending by means of which he&#xD;
claims to have reached the ultima thule of human know-&#xD;
ledge, and most readers, while reveling in the delights&#xD;
whereof so rich a store is laid before them, will insist&#xD;
that these glories were begotten of his own soul. Be that&#xD;
as it may, however, here is one, who, measured by the&#xD;
standard of the world itself, merits a monument stronger&#xD;
than iron, more endurable than granite, the gratitude of&#xD;
every soul that sighs for immortality ; for not a single&#xD;
new thought, but whole platoons of them, grand and mag-&#xD;
i fCent, hath he here presented, a deathless legacy to&#xD;
the world; and bye-and-bye these thoughts of 'Cynthia,'&#xD;
these 'Dealings with the Dead,' will become  beacon&#xD;
on the highway of Thought, and be remembere to the&#xD;
everlasting glory of the sufferer who penned them.&#xD;
best, Paschal, rest, my brother; thou brother and lover&#xD;
of thy race, for, thy work is well done ; thy thoughts&#xD;
can never die. The bad will hate, but all who love&#xD;
Truth, Goodness, and Beauty,will bless thee, and crown-&#xD;
thy napie with fadeless laurels.  -   G. D. S.&#xD;

INTRODUCTION..&#xD;
DEAR READER, your humble servant here presents&#xD;
you with a somewhat curious, nove" yet suggestive; and&#xD;
thought-provoking work. So farasmere language is&#xD;
concerned, it might have been sent forth upon its travels&#xD;
up and down the world, clad in better raiment; but as&#xD;
I had nothing better than linsey-woolsey whereofit&#xD;
fashion its apparel, why, it must e'en take its"chance in&#xD;
that.&#xD;
A man's coat amounts to but little atthe best, come&#xD;
pared to the man inside it,--and so of books. It is not&#xD;
always your gilt-edged annual that either carries the.&#xD;
most precious freight, or does the most good in the&#xD;
world ; hence so far as the verbal clothing of mypre-&#xD;
cious babe, this child of my soul is concerned, so' far&#xD;
as relates to the terms wherein that here offered is&#xD;
couched, nothing need be.said apologetically. If the&#xD;
dress suits, well and good ; if not, it is even well ;--.the&#xD;
'writer has done the very best that could be done, no&#xD;
one can do more. In making the assertions, the weird&#xD;
and strange revealments contained within the lids of&#xD;
this book, no one can be better aware of the risk en-&#xD;
countered of being laughed at by the wise people of&#xD;
this wise age, than I am. Doubtless there are those&#xD;
who will cavil, deride, sneer at and condemn the author&#xD;
and the work,: but what of that? My truths, if truths&#xD;
indeed they be, and to me, they are intensly such, will&#xD;
live. Why? -Because they were chipped off the Rock&#xD;
of Truth itself, and therefore will unquestionably sur-&#xD;

6           DEALINGS WITH THE   EAD.&#xD;
vive many a laugh, as have other ruths ere now. They&#xD;
and their discoverer can well afford being laughed at.&#xD;
The author feels that when the great Reaper, Death,&#xD;
shall have done his work, these same truth-seeds will&#xD;
spring up into Form, Life, and Beauty :-all for the&#xD;
gladdening o' the people :-and this feeling, this inner&#xD;
prophecy of and to the soul, contents and satisfies the&#xD;
being. Friendly reader, when this body shall have&#xD;
gone back to the dust whence it sprung in the hopeful&#xD;
years gone by ; when this soul shall be nestling in the&#xD;
bosom of its Saviour and his God, people who then&#xD;
shall read these pages will find, if not before, more in&#xD;
'at which the heart-weary one has here written, than&#xD;
either IApsychological romance, gr the daring specula-&#xD;
tions   undisciplined genius.&#xD;
The foregoing observations have reference more es-&#xD;
pecially to the first part of this work, which is pre-&#xD;
sented in the form of Revelations from the Dead. It&#xD;
does not owe its origin to what is ordinarily known&#xD;
as "I Spiritualism" :=-it did not, come either by the&#xD;
" Raps,' "Tips," " Table-turning," "Speaking medium-&#xD;
ship," " Writing," or in any other of the modes so&#xD;
commonly claimed for the mass of " Spiritual" litera-&#xD;
ture, now so widely circulated and read. The pro&#xD;
cess by Which what follows came, is to me as weirdly&#xD;
strange and novel, as anything can well be, I call this&#xD;
process THE BLENDING.&#xD;
The people called " Mediums," a singular order among&#xD;
ment set forth that their bodies are, for the time being,&#xD;
vacated by their souls, and that during the vacation, the&#xD;
soul of some one else, one who has died, and yet lives,&#xD;
takes possession of the physical structure, and then pro-&#xD;
ceeds to give forth his or her wisdom or folly for the&#xD;
enlightenment or darkening of men's minds. Another&#xD;
class tell us that they are "impressed" by a departed&#xD;
one to give voice to the Spirit's thought ; others declare&#xD;
that they are "obsessed." Well, it may all be so, or it-&#xD;
may not. I do not assume or presume to decide one way&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.            7&#xD;
or the other ::all that need be said on this point is, that&#xD;
this book does not owe its origin to either or any of&#xD;
these methods.&#xD;
Machiavelli,' the great Italian 'diplomat, issaid to&#xD;
have gained a thorough and complete knowledgewend&#xD;
insight of the state, frame of mind, and intentionsof&#xD;
other men, through a wonderful power which he, above&#xD;
most,.if not all men, possessed, of 'completely ideitify.&#xD;
ing himself by an intense desire and volition, with those&#xD;
with whom he came in contact. To such an extent and&#xD;
degree did he possess this power, that itwas an easy&#xD;
task to circumvent and overreach most, if nqt all his&#xD;
diplomatic opponents. He placed himself by1 mental&#xD;
effort, and physical as well, in the exact position occu-&#xD;
pied for the time being by his antagonists, or the person&#xD;
he designed to.read.&#xD;
No matter what the mood indicated by the physical&#xD;
appearance, or the outward manifestation of what was&#xD;
going on within, away down in the deeps of being, was&#xD;
he immediately moulded his features by the model thus&#xD;
furnished. " I am now in his place," said he, mentally,&#xD;
"and will see how to act, think and feel from his posi-&#xD;
tion ; and, for the time being, I sink my own personality&#xD;
Smy opinions, views,--in short all- my self-hood, preju-&#xD;
dices, likes, dislikes, and all else beside ;-in a word,;&#xD;
transmute Machiavelli into the other man :.-which&#xD;
being effected,, I shall be, to all intents and purposes,&#xD;
that other man for the time being, and of course will&#xD;
feel as he feels, see ashe sees, know as he knows, and be&#xD;
impelled to action by the identical motives whereby he&#xD;
is prompted.&#xD;
All the world knows that Machiavelli succeeded to&#xD;
a wonderful extent.; and by this power oftassumption,&#xD;
this easy, yet mysterious blending, he. often, int fact,&#xD;
nearly always, baffled hisfoes, and the foes of the State,&#xD;
so that now a successful diplomatist is said to be pur-&#xD;
suing the Machiavellian 'policy.&#xD;
Alnmost'any person can make successful' experiments&#xD;

&#xD;
in this--Science, shall Icall it ?-and will be surprised&#xD;
at the results. A man or woman appears before you&#xD;
with features bearing the impress of a certain kind of&#xD;
thought-and you can find out what kind by placing&#xD;
own features, so far as possible, in the same&#xD;
ape; keep them thus for several minutes, and you&#xD;
will become 'absorbed in the same that absorbs the&#xD;
individual before you, and in a short time will become&#xD;
an adept in the art of Soul-reading.&#xD;
Many men, and a still greater number of women, who&#xD;
possessed the power alluded to, have existed in all&#xD;
times past; but, above all others, the age we live in&#xD;
has been .prolific of such--so that now it is not at all&#xD;
difficult to find those who will enter at will, almost, the&#xD;
very abysses, labyrinths, and most secret recesses of&#xD;
your being. Indeed, persons abound in.nearly all the&#xD;
great cities of the world who attain high honor and re&#xD;
nown-to say nothing 'of the benefits of competence,&#xD;
and even wealth-by the exercise of this marvellous&#xD;
faculty.&#xD;
There are many wise ones who admit the existence&#xD;
of this power, yet deny its attainability by the many, and&#xD;
who stoutly maintain that it is a special gift of the&#xD;
Creator to a favored few. Against such a verdict the&#xD;
writer begs leave most respectfully to protest; 'and&#xD;
these are the grounds upon which that protest is based:&#xD;
All human powers and faculties are latent, until time,&#xD;
circumstance, and discipline bring them  out. All&#xD;
human beings are. created alike in so far forth as the&#xD;
germinal powers are concerned. .All men naturally&#xD;
love sweet sounds, and, if this taste be cultivated at 'an&#xD;
early day, are capable of musical appreciation, if not&#xD;
of vocal or -instrumental execution. The seeds of all&#xD;
unfolding lie perdu, or latent, in every human being;&#xD;
they are the property of Soul ; in Soul-soil they are&#xD;
imbedded, and from that soil they must eventually put&#xD;
forth 'the shoot, the shrub'the tree, the blanch,' leaf,&#xD;
blossom, and finally the fruit. Every faculty, strictly&#xD;
&#xD;
human, belongs to, and is a part of, every member of&#xD;
the species ; and that--this fact being admitted, though&#xD;
any given one or ricre may be manifested most power-&#xD;
fully by some, and not at all by others-all of them are&#xD;
one day to be developed, -called out, unfolded, in all,&#xD;
is a plain inference; nay,:an absolute certainty. The&#xD;
power to see withouteyes, demonstrated by scores and&#xD;
hundreds of clairvoyants, is not a gift peculiar to a cer-&#xD;
tain man or woman, or to :a certain order of people.' It&#xD;
is a power that can 'be had for the trying, :as-any good&#xD;
mesmerist will affirm and prove.&#xD;
It seems to me that the expression of the. Crucified,&#xD;
" I and my Father are one," contains a direct affirma.&#xD;
tion of the possibility of this blending. 'God was to&#xD;
Jesus the very essence of goodness ; Jesus strove to be&#xD;
also most thoroughly.good, and succeeded in reaching&#xD;
that point where Himself was in perfect -blending with&#xD;
the entire universe of: Goodness, and therefore with&#xD;
the Fount of all Excellence.&#xD;
Perfect blending is perfect love ; and whether that&#xD;
love be toward the person, the outer self, the body.; o&#xD;
toward the soul, or the mental treasures, or the secret&#xD;
self of another, the results are in degree, if not in kind,&#xD;
the same.&#xD;
Mental telegraphy will be a perfect success, when-&#xD;
ever two persons can be found in whom the power of&#xD;
entering the region of Sympathia shall normally exist.&#xD;
A few can transmit thought to, and receive thought&#xD;
back from, others, even now ; but presently scores of&#xD;
people will develop the ability.&#xD;
Now, this blending is.not a mere magnetic union of&#xD;
physical spheres, - but 'is :a Soul-process nearly alto.&#xD;
gather.&#xD;
Love, in its essence, is :a thing of the Spiritual part&#xD;
of us, though, alas I:it is often-put to' use uses.&#xD;
There was once, not many years. ago, a woman to&#xD;
whom I felt such a love as that subsisting between&#xD;
affectionate sisters ; for' it was deeper, purer, calmer&#xD;

10         DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
than that which binds brothers together. In life, her&#xD;
soul drew near, almost fearfully near, to  ine ; she&#xD;
thought my thoughts, read my spirit, sympatized with&#xD;
me in all my joys, my sorrows, and my  iarations.&#xD;
Often have we sat beside each other-that poor sick&#xD;
girl and I; and though no word broke the stillness of&#xD;
the sacred hour, yet not a region of our souls was there&#xD;
but was explored by the other ; not a silent thought that&#xD;
was not mutually understood and replied to. Presently&#xD;
she died-the forms were forever separated, yet not for&#xD;
a day were the mystic soul-links which bound s to-&#xD;
gether severed.' No sister, was ever more dearly loved&#xD;
than I loved her ; and that love was fully and as&#xD;
purely returned. Everybody called her " Sister "-&#xD;
everybody felt that to them she was truly such.&#xD;
Well, she died ; and after a year or two had passed,&#xD;
I began to understand that at times her soul was near&#xD;
me, and many and oft were the periods in which I did&#xD;
not seem to be myself, but had an invincible conviction&#xD;
that I was Cynthia for the time being, instead of who&#xD;
and what I am. By-and-by there came a consciousness&#xD;
of this blending, so deep, so clearly defined, so calm,&#xD;
that at last I began to appreciate a mighty, almost&#xD;
resistless Will and Purpose behind it all; for I was my-&#xD;
self and Cynthia-never simultaneously, as is asserted&#xD;
to be the case with many of the people called "Me-&#xD;
diums "-but in separate instants-now her, then my-&#xD;
self ; at first very imperfectly, but gradually approach-&#xD;
ing an absolute and complete mergement of Soul.&#xD;
This continued for nearly two years, at intervals, and&#xD;
after about eighteen months had passed, one portion of&#xD;
the process seemed to have reached completeness-for&#xD;
in a degree it changed, and instead of momentary, as&#xD;
'before, the transmutations became lQnger, until at last,&#xD;
as now, the chgges last sixty, and in one instance has&#xD;
reached two hundred and fortydive minutes.&#xD;
It may here be asked : " Where are you in the in-&#xD;
&#xD;
terim ?" and the answer is: "We are two in one, yet&#xD;
the stronger rules the hour."&#xD;
It will be seen, therefore, that this condition is as&#xD;
widely separated from those incident to - the " Medi-&#xD;
ums," as theirs is supposed to be different from the&#xD;
ordinary wakeful mood. They reach their state by a&#xD;
sort of retrocession from themselves ; they fall, or claim&#xD;
to fall, into a peculiar kind of slumber, their own facul-&#xD;
ties going, as it were, to sleep. On the contrary, mine&#xD;
is the direct opposite of this, for, instead of a sleep of&#xD;
any sort, there comes an intense u'akefulness. Nor is&#xD;
this all in which we differ; as are the processes and&#xD;
states apart, so also are the results different.&#xD;
The revelations of Spiritual existences, moods, modes,&#xD;
and conditions of being, as given .by .nearly every&#xD;
"Spiritual Medium" of whom I have ever heard or&#xD;
read, are, to say the least, totally unsatisfactory to the&#xD;
great majority of those who seek for information on the&#xD;
vital question of Immortality--how, and why, and to&#xD;
what great end we are thns gifted and endowed?&#xD;

The process, strange, wierd, and altogether unusual,&#xD;

so to speak, in that of a far more potent mentality. A&#xD;

feelings, thought that other's thoughts, read that other's&#xD;
past, aspired with that other's aspirations, and talked,&#xD;
spoke, and reasoned with and under that other's inspi-&#xD;
ration. For a time I attributed these exaltations of&#xD;
Soul to myself alone, and supposed that I was not at all&#xD;
indebted to foreign aid for many of the thoughts to&#xD;
which, at such moments, I frequently gave utterance;&#xD;
but much study of the matter has at length convinced&#xD;
me, not only that the inhabitants of the Soul-worlds&#xD;
have much to do in moulding the great world's future,&#xD;
but that occasionally they so manage things that their&#xD;
thoughts are often spoken, and their behests, ends, and&#xD;
purposes fulfilled by us mortals, when we imagine that&#xD;
we alone are entitled.to the sole credit of much that we&#xD;
say, tliink, and do, when the fact is, we doubtless are&#xD;
oftentimes merely the proxies of others, and act our&#xD;
allotted role in a drama whose origin is entirely super-&#xD;
natural, and the whole direction of which is conducted&#xD;
'by-personages beyond the veil.*&#xD;
Well, one day, it so happened that I repaired to a&#xD;
beautiful village in one of the New England States, on&#xD;
a visit to some very kind and well-beloved friends-the&#xD;
brother and the sister of the rare maiden whose won-&#xD;
drous thoughts abound in the volume now before the&#xD;
reader ; and while there, the conversation'ran on topics&#xD;
wide apart from either Mesmerism or its great cognate,&#xD;
"Spiritualism." During the time that had elpsed since&#xD;
my last visit to the beautiful village, some two years,&#xD;
Death had been busily gathering his harvests in all the&#xD;
regions round about ; or had he kept aloof from the&#xD;
house on the hill. No I cruel Death had been over its&#xD;
threshold, and Azrael had carried two precious souls,&#xD;
over the Dark River. These were Cynthia and her&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
After partalgg of a sorrow-seasoned meal, mourn-&#xD;
That many of them are inhabitants of other spheres, beings who&#xD;
never lived on this earth, I am firmly convinced. My reasons will be&#xD;
given in the sequel to this present volume.  -&#xD;

fully, and with aching heart and tearful eye, we, the&#xD;
left-behind and myself, took our way toward the ground&#xD;
where lay the sacred form of her we loved so deeply,&#xD;
so fully ; and there I wept, and the great salt tears&#xD;
bedewed the sod-for, indeed, my heart, poor, weary,&#xD;
troubled heart, was almost breaking. Soon we re-&#xD;
turned to the house upon the hill, and I lay me down&#xD;
upon the sofa, near the window-the very sofa whereon&#xD;
her sainted form was wont to recline in the days&#xD;
now, alas! 'fled, with her, forever and forevermore-&#xD;
that same little sofa whereon she used to sit and&#xD;
converse with us, with her sister Clarinda, the gentle&#xD;
and the good John Hart, and her well-beloved Jona-&#xD;
than, with my humble self, and a few select and sober-&#xD;
minded lovers of the good and true ; used to sit and&#xD;
converse upon the mysteries of the Great Beyond, and&#xD;
touching the realities of that other world, to which&#xD;
Disease was remorselessly, and with relentless purpose,&#xD;
fast urging her life-car. * * * And I threw myself&#xD;
upon the sofa ; and as I lay there, with closed eyes, I&#xD;
beheld the flitting ghosts of many a dead days with all&#xD;
its troops of glad and bitter memories, when suddenly&#xD;
it seemed that I was no longer myself-for so deep and&#xD;
perfect was the blending, that I had not merely an in-&#xD;
surmountable assurance that my body contained, for the&#xD;
time being, two complete souls, but even the very&#xD;
thoughts, modes of expression, and memory of the de-&#xD;
parted one was mine ; and yet this possession did not,&#xD;
fobr an instant, subvert my own' individuality. I was&#xD;
there, and so- was she.' For the time - being, we two&#xD;
were not merely as, but to all intents and purposes, we&#xD;
actually were, one.&#xD;
Arising from the recumbent position,. my body as-&#xD;
sumed certain singularities of movement peculiar to&#xD;
her before she flew up to her home i the bright em-&#xD;
pyrean, and these words were spoken: "The experi&#xD;

benefit of the people. I, we, intend to write it. A&#xD;

self as soon as the icy hand of Death had touched my&#xD;
heart, and frozen up my vitals. While with my friends,&#xD;
from whom the change separated me, I was, so far as&#xD;
frail mortals in my condition of bodily health can b6,&#xD;
quite happy and contented-contented to endure, with&#xD;
all possible patience, that for which there was no&#xD;
medicament, no remedy ; and, all things considered,&#xD;
satisfied I lived, and in the self-same spirit died. Died?&#xD;
No ; I am not dead 1-bodies change ; souls can never&#xD;
die. Why? For- the reason that God,. who, like&#xD;
human beings, is intelligent and immortal, can Himself&#xD;

&#xD;
with, began to take an especial interest in the great&#xD;
subject of an hereafter, as revealed by what purported&#xD;
to be the spirits of departed men and women ; and&#xD;
then, for the first time, as Death's cold presence&#xD;
sensibly approached me afar off, and the sense of&#xD;
GOING began to quicken in my being, I commenced seri-&#xD;
ously to speculate concerning immortality, and to pay&#xD;
greater heed to the alleged revelations from the mys-&#xD;
terious Beyond.&#xD;
Bye-and-bye, consumption so wasted me, that I grew&#xD;
tired ; and finally, a mist came before my eyes, and shut&#xD;
out the fields, the forests, and the faces of my friends,--my&#xD;
friends-none dearer than whom, were ever clasped to&#xD;
affection's warm heart. * * * * And so I slept,--but&#xD;
woke agair from out of that strange, deep sleep, called&#xD;
Death. The awakening was very strange !--was such&#xD;
as I had never even imagined to be possible.&#xD;
"Where am I?" was asked by myself of that very self.&#xD;
Not mine,.but a lower, sweeter, more musical voice, soft&#xD;
aid dulcet as the tinkle of a love bell, answered me&#xD;
from out a veil of rosy light, that hung between me,&#xD;
and, whatever was beyond. "In the Divine City of&#xD;
freed souls,--the land of Immortal, but not Eternal&#xD;
rest." * * * * I felt, and knew that I was---dead!1&#xD;
As the sense ,of these words struck upon my soul&#xD;
where this voice came from, seemed very strange to me,&#xD;
for this reason amongst others : I had, to a certain ex-&#xD;
tent, familiarized myself with Physics, and knew that&#xD;
sounds were supposed to be the result of certain aerial&#xD;
vibrations. Now, supposing this theory to be correct,&#xD;
it struck me, that.I, a disembodied soul, ought not to be&#xD;
competent to discern sounds, for there was neither tym-&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DIM AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
panumto receive, auditory nerves to conduct, nor external&#xD;
ear, to.collect these waves of sound.&#xD;
It seemed to me, that one of the two prevalent theo-&#xD;
ries must be false; either sound is not material, or that&#xD;
the Spirit of a human being is;-for I had not the shadow&#xD;
of a doubt, but that I was really, and forever, an in&#xD;
habitant of the soul-world. If sounds are material, how&#xD;
was it possible for me to hear them, being a Spirit? If&#xD;
a Spirit is but a refined form of matter, then the notion&#xD;
of its eternal durability, is a false one, and there must&#xD;
come a period when it too, like the body, must dissolve&#xD;
away. These things troubled me. I had passed to&#xD;
death, not as a sluggard, and careless of what might&#xD;
await me, but with every faculty keenly awake., Nor&#xD;
do Isuppose five minutes elapsed after I emerged from&#xD;
my body, ere I was perfectly alive to all that surround-&#xD;
ed me.&#xD;
I distinctly saw certain familiar things, and recognized&#xD;
them; but there was not any difficulty in comprehending&#xD;
the rationale of this; for I perceived that solar light&#xD;
was not the only source of illumination the earth pos-&#xD;
sessed. Indeed, there is no such thing as darkness.&#xD;
The life of all things is light, and although sun, moon,&#xD;
and stars should hide behind an impenetrable veil, yet&#xD;
the things of earth would still be visible to the sight of&#xD;
the soul.&#xD;
There  are  two   other sources of light; first,&#xD;
the electrical emanations from every ngaterial object&#xD;
illumine them, and whatever may be near; and second,&#xD;
the air itself, which fleshly lungs inhale, is but the outer&#xD;
garb of a finer and magnetic sea, which not only en-&#xD;
circles the earth, but stretches away in all directions to&#xD;

&#xD;
the outer limits of creation; and in this, all things are&#xD;
radiant, all things visible.&#xD;
These observations were quickly made ; and in an&#xD;
instant thereafter, I turned toward the fleecy veil pie-&#xD;
viously observed, and saw the figure of an old, gray-&#xD;
haired man emerge therefrom, leading by the hand, a&#xD;
sweet and lovely girl apparently about ten years old.&#xD;
The gleesome smile on that angel's face, the look of&#xD;
bland benevolence on the features of the man, surpassed&#xD;
aught of the kind that I hak ever seen before. Both of&#xD;
them approached, and greeted me. I could not return&#xD;
the salutation, because the strangeness andi"utter novelty,&#xD;
not only of iny new situation, but of my sensations,&#xD;
were such that it was impossible to act as in other mo-&#xD;
ments, I feel certain I should have been prompted to.&#xD;
The man spbke, and called me "daughter." The tones&#xD;
were precisely those I had formerly heard; and two*&#xD;
things surprised me : First, their serene and liquid&#xD;
melody,--so very different from those one would na-&#xD;
turally expect to hear from one of his appearance; and&#xD;
second, that very appearance itself: for both the man&#xD;
and child were clothed after the manner and fashion of&#xD;
the earth.&#xD;
This was a matter of astonishment, for I had supposed&#xD;
that the clothing of the Spirit was vastly different&#xD;
from that of the body. Evidently, the old man read&#xD;
my mind, and understood the cause of my perplexity.&#xD;
Drawing near to where I stood, he touched my forehead&#xD;
with his finger, and said, " Be clear, my child, be clear."&#xD;
As if that touch were magic, there came an instan-&#xD;
taneous change over me ; it was as if I thought to the&#xD;
point I wished, and that with perfect clarity. Things,&#xD;
&#xD;
which a moment before were wrapped in the folds of&#xD;
mystery, now became transparent as the plainest I could&#xD;
wish.&#xD;
.As a matter of course, I took notice of the friends I&#xD;
had just left behind me-yes, behind me, in what was&#xD;
now in very truth a faoff world:--even though not ten&#xD;
yards intervened, between myself and the dear ones,&#xD;
who now mourned me; yet in presence of the fact that&#xD;
I have verymomentous revelations to make,-revelations&#xD;
that will startle the world,-I cannot now stop to relate&#xD;
my emotions, my sorrows or my joys, for I felt that at&#xD;
last I was in the realm of pure knowledge ; and now&#xD;
feel that this precious opportunity must be improved, to&#xD;
other ends than a mere recital of my emotions and&#xD;
sympathies however acute and tender they may have&#xD;
been.&#xD;
The communication between the soul-world and earth&#xD;
is far more difficult and rare than I had believed, or&#xD;
than thousands believe to-day. Much, I learned, that&#xD;
passes among men for spiritual manifestation, really has&#xD;
no such origin, while many things, attributed to an&#xD;
origin purely mundane, are really the work of intelligent&#xD;
beings, beyond the misty veil.&#xD;
Long previous to my final illness, I had held many&#xD;
interesting conversations with my friends, ,oncerning&#xD;
the higher life and worlds, and particularly with the&#xD;
one by whose aid I am now enabled to make these die-&#xD;
closures; and I had made a solemn compact, to the&#xD;
effect, that if it were possible to return subsequent to&#xD;
death, I would do so, and, reveal such mysteries as I&#xD;
might be enabled or permitted to. This resolution grew&#xD;
out of the fact, that not one of the theories, regarding&#xD;

20         DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
the post mortem existence of human kind, which I had&#xD;
ever heard or read, gave me the satisfaction that my&#xD;
soul desired. I suspected that many of the current no-&#xD;
tions regarding the lands beyond the curtain, were, to&#xD;
say the least, largely tinctured with the mind of the&#xD;
individuals through whose lips  he oracular utterances&#xD;
came ; consequently I became, to a degree, suspicious&#xD;
of all modern eolism and eolists, because I feared their&#xD;
inspirations had not so high and deep a source as they&#xD;
claimed, and is claimed for them.&#xD;
My mind, in this respect, is still unchanged. The&#xD;
first lesson that flashed in upon me, after the mysterious&#xD;
clarification of soul to which allusion has been made,&#xD;
was this': People on earth spend a great deal of time&#xD;
in acquiring lessons which have to be unlearned, upon&#xD;
their entrance on the upper life ;--must be unlearned,&#xD;
ere they can advance far in the acquisition of the rare&#xD;
treasures of knowledge, to be found only by the true&#xD;
seeker, even in that mighty realm which constitutes the&#xD;
soul-world.&#xD;
God has placed all true human joys, there, as well as&#xD;
on the earth, upon high shelves, whence they cannot be&#xD;
taken by proxy ;-they must be reached for by those&#xD;
who would have them; and the more precious the joy,&#xD;
the higher the shelf ;-the more valuable the volume, the&#xD;
greater effort is required to obtain the perusal thereof.&#xD;
This is the first great law.&#xD;
Now, in collecting what purported to. be scraps of&#xD;
knowledge, from the realm of spiritual existence, I&#xD;
found on my entry there, that I had laid up quite a&#xD;
store of falsities in the magazines of my soul:-laid up&#xD;
great heaps of what I supposed were the gold and dia&#xD;
&#xD;
mounds of supernal truth; but which, no sooner had I&#xD;
entered the portals of the vast temple of Eternity, than&#xD;
I found to be the most useless rubbish; and nearly all&#xD;
NY treasures proved to be the merest paste and tinsel.&#xD;
The first thing, therefore, which the soul desirous of&#xD;
attaining real proficiency in knowledge, has to do, is to&#xD;
unlearn its follies as quick as possible.&#xD;
This process is called by a term signifying vastation,&#xD;
or throwing off. Some do this at once and with ease ;&#xD;
others linger a long time in error, and only attain the&#xD;
great end through great trial and perseverance, just as&#xD;
persons on earth. My desire was ever to, and for the&#xD;
truth ; hence the process, to me was-one of comparative&#xD;
ease. The ideas which I had imbibed, and given my&#xD;
-heart to, concerning matters spiritual, were the same&#xD;
that are still current amongst those who accept that&#xD;
which is known as modern Spiritualism. Succinctl&#xD;
stated, they were these: first, The spirit of a hudag&#xD;
being is the product of the physical body; the Etim&#xD;
being is a triplicate, composed of soul, or the thinking&#xD;
principle, the body, and an intermediate link, called&#xD;
spirit ; possessing all the organs of, and shaped like&#xD;
the body, and which serves to connect this last with the&#xD;
soul, while on earth, and being its ,eternal casket after&#xD;
death. The soul, spirit and body are called into being&#xD;
at one time, and that upon the earth.&#xD;
The° spiritual body, like the physical, is subject both&#xD;
to waste and want, for which ample and: dueprovision&#xD;
has by God'been made. It has thirst, hunger, and&#xD;
amatory love, all of which have their appropriate grati.&#xD;
fications in the Spirit-world, This spiritual world itself&#xD;
is on the surface of a zone surrounding the earth, at a&#xD;

&#xD;
distance of one hundred miles, more or less; above this&#xD;
zone, is another and another, to the number of twelve ;&#xD;
each zone is a 'Sphere,' and its inhabitants are divided&#xD;
off into classes, degrees, societies and circles. All the&#xD;
pones are diversified with real and absolute rivers, trees,&#xD;
mountains, lakes, landscapes, cities, and so on, just as is&#xD;
the material globe; and all these things are fixtures,&#xD;
Such, in brief, are the general ideas on the subject enter-&#xD;
tained by-the people ; and such as I had believed and&#xD;
conceived to be true. But when I came to pass through&#xD;
the change, and to realize the new condition, I ascer-&#xD;
tained that so- far from being founded in reality, they&#xD;
were simply-nonsense !,&#xD;
According to the foregoing, which is confessedly the,&#xD;
most popular conception of the realms beyond, and of&#xD;
its inhabitants, that world is scarcely better than the one&#xD;
that mortals occupy. These notions totally ignore&#xD;
Spirit; for, .according to them, Spirit is nothing more'&#xD;
than matter in an exceedingly refined, or rather, subli-&#xD;
mated, condition; whereas Spirit is no such thing. True,&#xD;
it animates material things, but itself is not material.&#xD;
It is above, beyond, and discreted- from it. Like the&#xD;
asymptotes of an arc, it forever approaches, but never&#xD;
actually contacts matter. 'The same general theory. ae,&#xD;
cords mankind an origiAthere in space and time merely,&#xD;
and at best predicates but sempiternity, or a future end-&#xD;
less duration for him; whereas, if soul begins to be at all&#xD;
on the plane of earth and matter, it must have but a very&#xD;
ill-grounded assurance of an endless race. No, this is,&#xD;
not correct ; for Soul, like God, is from forever in the&#xD;
past; to forever in the distance; and so far from origin-&#xD;
ating on the earth, it has for myriads of -ons aped&#xD;
&#xD;
its career through God's infinite Silence Halls, and now&#xD;
merges, whether for the first time or not, is needless to&#xD;
inquire at this point, into the vocal Harmonead. In the&#xD;
life of earth, the soul awakes from its pre-state into one&#xD;
as different as can well be thought of; and at deathit&#xD;
experiences another waking,.quite atartling, but in+&#xD;
finitely more grand.&#xD;
The fit lesson,then, that I learned was, That with a&#xD;
great dcal of philosophy, I had but very little -knows=&#xD;
edge ; and instead of finding the Soul-world analagous&#xD;
to the earth-world, in fact I found them vastly different,&#xD;
and possessing no one thing in common, so far as the&#xD;
surroundings of the spiritual entrant was concerned.&#xD;
All that has been said required several minutes to de-&#xD;
scribe, but not ten seconds to experience.&#xD;
Ilooked towardthe old man and the childmarvellinglas&#xD;
before observed, that they wore clothing after the man&#xD;
ner of the earth-kin, and bore the appearance of4e41&#xD;

of air, just such air as I had been used to breathe, albeit&#xD;
that was not possible any longer, for the reason that&#xD;
it was, all too heavy for the respiratory apparatus of&#xD;
that which now constituted my body, or at least the&#xD;
vehicle of myself-the thinking, acting, living me. My&#xD;
method of locomotion differed essentially from that of&#xD;
my two companions, who did not walk, but seemed to&#xD;
glide along at will through that same air, which was&#xD;
to me quite palpable, for I distinctly noticed that its&#xD;
touch was of a velvety character, and quite elastic. My&#xD;
feet moved ; theirs did not. And so we passed out of&#xD;
the house through the open door,-for a person had&#xD;
just entered.&#xD;
From one or two incidental circumstances that took&#xD;
place, not essential to this narrative, and therefore with-&#xD;
held, I became convinced that unless some incarnate&#xD;
man or woman had raised the latch of that door, it&#xD;
must, so far as I was concerned, have remained shut to&#xD;
all eternity, barring wind, decay, accident, or an earth-&#xD;
quake ; for in my then state of enlightenment on the&#xD;
subject, I saw no possible means whereby to effect our&#xD;
liberation. It struck me that unless some such agency&#xD;
as has been named, came to our assistance, we must&#xD;
either make our egress by means of the chimney, or&#xD;
stay pent up there until the elements dissolved a portion&#xD;
of the edifice ; or, supposing it to be proof against de-&#xD;
cay, a dreadful alternative, so;it seemed,. there we must&#xD;
remain for evermore. Subsequently I learned that even&#xD;
were such a thing possible, and I never got outside of that&#xD;
dwelling, yet it would be far less terrible than fear might&#xD;
lead one to imagine or suspect ; for still there would re-&#xD;

the hours-might be profitably employed in visiting its&#xD;
own treasure houses and in counting therare jewels there&#xD;
stored away ; besides which, it could perform many a&#xD;
pleasant voyage, visiting mighty continents, rare islands,&#xD;
wondrous cities, and marvellous countries of its own&#xD;
tremendous being ;-aye ! it could amuse itself for ages&#xD;
in merely glancing at the hills, valleys, caverns-strange&#xD;
deep caverns they are too--the oceans, forests, fields&#xD;
fens, brakes, and marshes of its mighty self; nor would&#xD;

who doeth all things well ! Soul! 1ighty potentate!&#xD;

DEALINGS WITH. THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
Victim at once, and victor of circumstance and time !&#xD;
Thou enigma, which millions think they have solved,&#xD;
even while thou laughest at them ; who imagining they&#xD;
have untied the knot. have not even found the clue !&#xD;
Strange riddle ! Thing. of which men think they are&#xD;
well informed, because they have learned a few of thy,&#xD;
names, and can call thee Psyche, Soul, Spirit, Pneuma&#xD;
and Breath; word-names, which generally convey about&#xD;
as much of thee to the common understanding, as the&#xD;
name-words Algebra, Geometry, Music and Number, do&#xD;
to the barbarians who hear them pronounced, of the&#xD;
vast realities that underlie the sounds 'or the signs.&#xD;
Soul! Existence, whereof eolists and pedants learnedly&#xD;
prate and bluster in long phrase and loud tone, as if&#xD;
thou didst not command silence of him who would,&#xD;
approach thee, and seek to know the awful mysteries&#xD;
slumbering beneath thy titles. Soul ! Whereof, every-.&#xD;
body- talks so much, but of which even the wisest of&#xD;
either earth or heaven know so very little.&#xD;
SWell, in my ignorance, I felt that unless some one,&#xD;
something material, had opened that door, we must stay&#xD;
imprisoned there in that house upon the hill, forever and&#xD;
for evermore.&#xD;
How little, how very little, I then knew or suspected&#xD;
concerning the mighty powers la-tent, and never yet fully&#xD;
unfolded in any human being-no matter whom, no&#xD;
matter where located, how high in heaven, on earth, or&#xD;
deep down in the bottomless hell, or the blackest&#xD;
barathrum of the infinitudes of Possibility. No one&#xD;
save God can fathom the profounds- of Soul. Why?&#xD;
Because, like Him, it is absolutely Infinite: Him, in&#xD;
Conscious Power-it, in Capability ! Very imperfect&#xD;

still, and necessarily so, yet -my notions of the Soul's&#xD;
powers were then exceedingly vague, crude, and unde-&#xD;
fined. In other and succeeding states to which I subse-&#xD;
quently attained, much of this ignorance was dispelled by&#xD;
new light which constantly brpke in upon my being.&#xD;
And we passed beyond the portal of the house, my-&#xD;
self crossing at the same instant its threshold, and that&#xD;
of Time ; nor did I once cast a glance toward the frail&#xD;
and decaying shell from which a joyous thrill of super-&#xD;
consciousness told me that I had forever escaped ; in-&#xD;
deed I had no disposition to do so, for the reason that&#xD;
new and -strange emotions and sensations crowded so&#xD;
fast upon me, that my whole attention was absorbed&#xD;
thereby ; for they swept like the billows of a wind -&#xD;
troubled lake, across the entire sea of my, new-born&#xD;
being. One thought, and one alone, connected with&#xD;
earth, assumed importance, and that was associated&#xD;
with the physical phenomenon of dissolution, and if-&#xD;
shaped itself in a. hundred ways with the rapidity of&#xD;
.lightning-no, not lightning, but quicker, for that is&#xD;
very slow compared to the flashings and the rushings&#xD;
forth of thought, even in the earth-made brain; how&#xD;
much more rapid, then, from a source around which&#xD;
are no cerebral impediments to obstruct. "IDeath-this&#xD;
it is to be DEAD !" thought I. How blind, how deaf we&#xD;
are, not to see, and know, and hear, that all things&#xD;
tell of life, life, life--being, rear and true; while&#xD;
nothing, nothing in the great domain of our God,&#xD;
speaks one word of absolute death, of a blotting out of&#xD;
Soul-Soul, which, while even cramped in cores bodies;&#xD;
sometimes mounts the Capitals of existence, and with&#xD;
far-penetrating vision pierces the profoundest depths of&#xD;

I am not faint, but strong; not sad, but joyous.".&#xD;
These were my observations on, realizing the great&#xD;
change. Many a time had I read and heard of the&#xD;
capacity human beings have of experiencing joys purely&#xD;
nervous. Nearly all presenthuman' pleasures are based&#xD;
.pon the fineness and susceptibility of the nerves tore-&#xD;
ceive and impart magnetic' impressions. "My nerves&#xD;
had aforetime;.been made to tingle with strange,.deep&#xD;
bliss when in the presence of those ,I loved, after their.&#xD;

had known the tumultuous thrill of 'friendship's joyous.&#xD;

learned better.&#xD;

I say that great joy was, mine on fifiing myself ui}m&#xD;

the latter, and yet the spheres of their several existences&#xD;
be ,as far' -apart as is North from South.. The one sees-&#xD;
and knows only from appearances, the other from posi-&#xD;
tive rapport. This fact at -once explains many of the&#xD;
differences in the accounts which mortals receive, and un-&#xD;
mistakably so,'from the lands beyond the swelling flood,&#xD;
The kingdoms o'er the sea. My knowledge flowed in&#xD;
upon me through the channels of intuition, and through&#xD;
them I learned that the hyper-sensational joys to which&#xD;
allusion has been made, are ever experienced in exact&#xD;
ratio to the purity of the past record of the life. ;Those&#xD;
which I felt were only of the fourth degree, there being&#xD;
three beyond, though how mine should have been so&#xD;
intensified and deepened, was, and, for reasons plainly&#xD;
to be seen, must ever remain, a mystery. The amount,&#xD;
degree, and even kind, of joy felt by any soul upon its&#xD;
passage over the Myst, depends upon three things, and&#xD;
these are : First, the nature of the motives which, pre-&#xD;
vious to the mortuary divorce, prompted to all or any&#xD;
action, either' toward the self, the neighbor, or society ;&#xD;
Second, the amount of good a person has done on earth ;&#xD;
and Third, the amount of use, in' the higher sense, they&#xD;
may have gpbserved previous to physical dissolution.&#xD;
Nellie and I, and the old giay-haired man-who ac-&#xD;
companied her, soon reached the road in front of the&#xD;
house wherein I had lived, and wherein I was born into a&#xD;
newer phase of life. While looking at my companions,&#xD;
to find out Whither they were going, the child, by the&#xD;
exercise of a power not then fully understood by myself,&#xD;
rose into the air a foot or more, laid her hand gently on&#xD;
my forehead, patted it 'tenderly, and said : "Cone !&#xD;
V Lre going to show you your home, and then mine,&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE :DEAD. .&#xD;
and then his /" She said this with a smile, so pure, so&#xD;
radiant, that I instantly divined that there was truth in&#xD;
the theory that every one has a conjugal mate in the&#xD;
universe somewhere, albeit I shrank from, and dreaded&#xD;
to meet mine, if, indeed, I had one, for I had seen some-&#xD;
what of that which passes for love among men; and,&#xD;
while hailing and delighting in amicive, I felt a shud,&#xD;
dering disgust at anything that assumed the form of&#xD;
amatory love. Love was admired, but its passional&#xD;
phases feared and despised. My tutelage was just&#xD;
begun.&#xD;
The touch of the child's hand was as plain, palpable&#xD;
and physical as any touch ever felt before,-quite as&#xD;
much so as was that of the dear sister who smoothed&#xD;
my dying brow. 'After all, then, spirits are material.&#xD;
I feel their fingers, see their forms, hear their words,&#xD;
and I am in all respects as nervously sensitive as ever&#xD;
in the by-gone years of sickness ! Oh, this -mystery of&#xD;
the double existence, which, after all, seems to be but&#xD;
two phases of a single state ; when, when shall it be&#xD;
solved ?' This thought passed through my mind, nor&#xD;
can there be the least doubt but they both read it quite&#xD;
as well as myself, for the old man smiled gently and&#xD;
benignly, the girl with half-concealed merriment and&#xD;
glee.&#xD;
I now passed off into a strange and peculiar state,&#xD;
but whether what followed resulted from the touch oft&#xD;
not, it is impossible to say. At first I was seized with&#xD;
an intense desire to know more of what must be called&#xD;
my physique, and a rapid inspection revealed the fact&#xD;
that I possessed, all and-singular, the organs in the new&#xD;
condition, that had been in the old. There were my&#xD;

and+~-real, actual hands, evidently,-but they were&#xD;
pr thin, pale emaciated, wrinkled, and of a decidedly&#xD;
e, consumptive caste,-precisely as they had appeared&#xD;
every day r the a t long months of pain and nisery..&#xD;
y hair wa   i   ,'and in all other respects as before-&#xD;
-ufeet felt tender ; nor was there any difference be-&#xD;
tween my then, and prior state, except that a nameless&#xD;
riling joy pervaded me, and which left absolutely&#xD;
nothing to be wished for in that respect ; for as the&#xD;
mouth of every nerve drew in the magnetic essence, in&#xD;
which I floated, it seemed as if living streams of sense-&#xD;
joy rushed through every channel and avenue of being;&#xD;
and it struck m  that if there were no other reward&#xD;
for having lived and suffered, yet that the sensations&#xD;
consequent upon physical death would fully compenaate&#xD;
a life of agony.*&#xD;
Soon a' sense of vacuity stole over me, and brought&#xD;
the realization, that having passed through two worlds&#xD;
I was rapidly approaching one still more wonderful&#xD;
and strange.&#xD;
Many a time had I been mesmerized by. friends, in my&#xD;
far distant-dwelling, by my well-beloved brother J. in par-&#xD;
ticular, who all sought by that means to alleviate my&#xD;
sufferings; and not seldom had I passed into what is&#xD;
popularly termed the Superior State;t and the feeling&#xD;
* All the dead people are not thus favored. Up to the present&#xD;
was an inhabitant merely of the Spiritual world, but had not yets&#xD;
entered upon the vast domains of the realm of Soul. There are two&#xD;
worlds into which it is possible for man to step into from the portals&#xD;
of the grave, as all will be convinced who either study the subject or&#xD;
give this introductory work a careful perusal.&#xD;
My researches have proved to me, that in nine cases in every&#xD;
ten, taking an entire average, the sleeping subject never once actually&#xD;

induced by Nellie's touch was akin to that, but was far&#xD;
more profound.'. First there came a sort of mental re-&#xD;
trocession, consequent upon my previous intellectual&#xD;
activity.    The soul-principle seemed to bound back&#xD;
from its investigations of the previous moment, to a&#xD;
pinnacle within itself, from whence it as rapidly sunk&#xD;
down into one of the profoundest labyrinths of its own&#xD;
vast caverns.&#xD;
Down, down, still lower and deeper into the awful&#xD;
abyss of itself it sank, until at last it stood solitary and&#xD;
alone in one of its own secret halls. The outer realm,&#xD;
with all its pains and joys, cares, sorrows and ambitions,&#xD;
hopes, likes, antipathies and aspirations; all its shadows&#xD;
and fitful gleams of light, were left behind, and naught&#xD;
of the great wide world remained; for its lakes and&#xD;
green trees, its gardens and its tiny brooks,its beetling&#xD;
cliffs and radiant sky grew     distant, very distant, until&#xD;
at length a cold and chilling horror crept over me, and&#xD;
suggested that perhaps, after all, the fearful doctrine&#xD;
enters the domain of spirit at all, during the trance; but instead&#xD;
thereof, roams and revels in the Fancy Realm of his own, or some one&#xD;
else's soul. A suggestion,-either spontaneous or accepted-serves as&#xD;
the hither end of a clue, the line reaching just where the partially freed&#xD;
mind chooses to direct it. Frequent repetitions of the exercise"'of this&#xD;
organ of spectral- illusion, lead directly to bad results, for ,the&#xD;
illusions soon impress themselves as realities, and the grossest and&#xD;
most absurd fanaticisms result ; as witness the thousand phases of&#xD;
spiritual belief. In addition to this, the habit of mesmerizing, or bel&#xD;
ing mesmerized, is a ruinous one to all concerned, producing pestilence&#xD;
-and moral death. True, where both parties are good and pure, no&#xD;
harm may at first ensue, but at last an abnormal susceptibility results'&#xD;
by which any man or woman may be led into "the jaws of death, into&#xD;
the mouth of hell." I speak of course concerning indiscriminate Mag-&#xD;
netizing.      2*&#xD;

mighkt1e true, which declares, that some human beings&#xD;
are Godidoomed to annihilation ; and the. anguish that'&#xD;
tlis conceit brought with it, was almost unbearable,&#xD;
even by a free-born soul. But, thank God! this last&#xD;
Yolly of the philosophers,---last and greatest save one-&#xD;
te doctrine that "whatever is is right," in every and all&#xD;
senses, is a libel on Himself and His goodness.&#xD;
Finally it seemed as if my being had been concentered,&#xD;
'    or localized to a single point, and even that soon faded&#xD;
out, and anutter blankness enveloped my soul. How long&#xD;
this continued is impossible to be told, but the next ex-&#xD;
perience was that consequent upon a series of sudden&#xD;
thrills or shocks, like unto those which a person receives&#xD;
who takes hold of the conducting knobs of a highly&#xD;
charged galvanic battery,-or rather when touching&#xD;
the cup of a leyden jar. These instantly aroused me.&#xD;
I started up as from a death-stupor. But what a change,&#xD;
if not in myself, at least in my surroundings ! I was in&#xD;
the center of a new, but limited world. Around me&#xD;
was an atmosphere of mellow rosy light, different from&#xD;
any ever known to me before,-an atmosphere, radiant,&#xD;
sweet, soft, and redolent with perfumes of an order and&#xD;
fineness surpassingly grateful. ' I was in the Soul-world,&#xD;
--my Soul-world :-a realm whereof God alone was&#xD;
Lord-and I His tributary Queen. The feelings con-&#xD;
sequent on this induction were strange, but pleasant.&#xD;
The thoughts that now arose, were not, as formerly,.&#xD;
mere shadowy forms, inconsistent and impalpable, nor&#xD;
was the scene of their action within the head; true,&#xD;
they were born there, but that was all. They were&#xD;
no longer subjective merely, fleeting and ephemeral,&#xD;
but were objective, positive and real. I saw, but not&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALIN~GS WITH- THE DEAD.&#xD;
alone with eyes, for the simulacraeof the object w&#xD;
nessed within that sphere, even the faint outline o e&#xD;
most far-off memograph, seemed to stream in upon me&#xD;
through'a thousand new doors, and I appeared to ac-&#xD;
quire knowledge by two opposite methods,; first by o-&#xD;
ing out involuntarily to whatever was to, be, known;&#xD;
and second, by absorbing the images of, things,-just&#xD;
as the eye absorbs a landscape.&#xD;
A person beholding me at that moment, would have&#xD;
concluded, and rightly too, that -I had just arisen from&#xD;
off a sort'of cloud-couch near the center of the sphere,&#xD;
toward which my face was turned. On that couch I&#xD;
beheld the exact image. not of my person, but of ,he&#xD;
clothes, the resemblance of which to those once worn&#xD;
on earth, it will be remembered, had .so greatly sur-&#xD;
prised me in the earlier part of this experience. While&#xD;
yet I gazed upon that ghost of a dress, it slowly faded&#xD;
into nothingness. Desiring to know the rationale pf&#xD;
this occurrence, it came to me that the worlds are not&#xD;
only full of objects, but must necessarily be still more&#xD;
full of the images thereof,-images which fix themselves&#xD;
more or less permanently, on whatever plastic material&#xD;
which they may chance to come in contact with. Some-&#xD;
times the lightning will pass over a body or object;&#xD;
and in passing will fix and bring out into visibility the&#xD;
images of things already there. Nature is full .of&#xD;
mirrors. This is the memory of Matter--the Photo-&#xD;
graphy of the substantial universe. Memory- but th e&#xD;
photography of soul. Everything-that strikes the eye, or&#xD;
the senses in any way, leaves an exact image of itself upon&#xD;
the -cylinder of Retention, which cylinder winds and&#xD;
unwinds, according as it takes on or gives off the im-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7536-00000020"/>&#xD;
DEALIN    WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
pression, whatever it may be.  Thus the image of a&#xD;
tone, a sound, a peculiar trill, as well as of material,&#xD;
things, can be, and are photographed upon the soul.&#xD;
Nothing is lost,--not even the myriad images floating&#xD;
off from all things about us, day after day. The&#xD;
amazing beauties of a snow storm, a sleet shower, an&#xD;
autumn forest, a rich garden, the countless flowers on&#xD;
which man's material eye never rested, are all safely&#xD;
cared for by Nature's Daguerrian Artist, and they float&#xD;
about the material worlds until sometimes the frost will&#xD;
pin a few of them to the window-panes in winter, or&#xD;
they are breathed through the spiritual atmosphere into&#xD;
some poetic soul, who incarnates them in canvass, marble,&#xD;
or deathless verse. This revelation, of course, proves&#xD;
that there isla higher world than most men have yet&#xD;
dreamed of, and that too, right around them. In fact,&#xD;
all things and events are but a simple. process of what&#xD;
may be called Deific Photography. All forms, all&#xD;
things, all events, are but God's thoughts fixed for a&#xD;
time. These mental images go forth in regular' or~er,&#xD;
and constitute the sublime procession of the ages, and&#xD;
all human events and destinies are but'the externaliza-&#xD;
tion of Deific fore-had thoughts. Here is the rationale&#xD;
of vaticination or prophecy. Certain persons are so&#xD;
exalted, that moving in the-Spiritual atmosphere, which&#xD;
contains the. pre-images of approaching events, they&#xD;
read a few of them, and lo! in the coming years the&#xD;
occurrences are enacted; for the spiritual phasmas&#xD;
have taken form,-the reflected image of the Deific&#xD;
thought has at last passed through the dark material&#xD;
camera, been fixed by a law of celestial chemistry,&#xD;
brought out to the surface, or 'developed,' by the grand&#xD;
&#xD;
manipulators of Nature's laboratory, and lo! anew&#xD;
the world and age rejoices, though individuals;and com-&#xD;
munities may mourn.&#xD;
There is truth, therefore, in the doctrine of fore-ordi-&#xD;
nation. But this truth is general. always, and not par&#xD;
ticular, for while the current and area of events are&#xD;
pre-established, still every soul, in any and all its states,&#xD;
has an absolute sphere of self-itivity ;-the, law of&#xD;
Distinctness permits it to take the utmost advantage of&#xD;
conditions for its o wn improvement. For instance,&#xD;
take that which constitutes aVeach tree, or a rose, give&#xD;
itWand its successors the best possible chance to unfold&#xD;
its latent properties, and the rose or peach principle&#xD;
will put forth, in the course of two generations, a forest&#xD;
of beauties, an ocean of perfume, a mine of loveliness,&#xD;
which, judging the plants by what appeared originally,&#xD;
they never contained ; and yet nothing is more certain&#xD;
than that every plant, even the prickly pear, the brist&#xD;
-ling-thorn, and unsightly thistle, contain the germs of a,&#xD;
beauty too vast to be comprehended by mortal man.&#xD;
In the succeeding pages there is an account of God&#xD;
and Monads which will add much to the needed light&#xD;
on this subject. I cannot express them now for lack of&#xD;
suitable conditions, which can only be had in the midst&#xD;
of religious calm, holy solitude, and beneath a more&#xD;
sunny sky than bends over us at the present writing.&#xD;
As the appearance of my dress faded away, and the&#xD;
truth just faintly limned, flashed across ne, I began&#xD;
to realize somewhat of the majesty of the thing called&#xD;
soul ; and saw that, while the dress was a mere spectral&#xD;
garb, so also were those of the little girl and the old&#xD;

tio ed   regard.to the matter, while in my previous&#xD;
state, I would have freely sworn that all I saw was&#xD;
'ealr-for in my then unenlightened state, they were so.&#xD;
This suggests the subject of insanity. A man may be&#xD;
in a state wherein he can only behold appearances. To&#xD;
him they are real, to some one else they are false, while&#xD;
to those who can look over the entire ground, both&#xD;
would be deemed right and both wrong. Man is of&#xD;
birthright a creator, and the law of Distinctness forces&#xD;
his creations to resemble himnlf. If he is poor and&#xD;
lean, so will be the world he fashions around him voli-&#xD;
tionally, or which shall be his natural and spontaneous&#xD;
-out-creation. The highest happiness of man is found&#xD;
in the act of creation, whether it be poem, picture, en-&#xD;
gine, system of thought, or anything else. Hence the&#xD;
enfranchised soul, dwelling in its real world, on the&#xD;
thither side of time, has the power of assumption to a&#xD;
degree commensurate with its desire for wisdom, its&#xD;
determining motives, the good it has done, and the&#xD;
ends of use it has accomplished. It can, therefore,&#xD;
assume any form it pleases,-but for the purpose Qf&#xD;
wrong-doing, or concealing its identity, it is utterly&#xD;
powerless in this respect ; so that while it may mas-&#xD;
querade as much as it chooses to for its amusement,&#xD;

known as A, nor can A ever pass for B, save in cases'&#xD;
of insanity, wherein A has a firm conviction that he is&#xD;
really B, in which case, and for redemptive ends, he is&#xD;
sometimes recognized as B, till his cure is effected. It&#xD;

"Where was my soul when it made these interesting&#xD;

&#xD;
Thou-dost not realize that they are latent, while thou-&#xD;
and":thy kind are active, self-moving thoughts of .one&#xD;
great eternal thinker P Thou hast not yet learned that&#xD;
every living thing, vegetable or sentient, is a temporary&#xD;
home of.a mighty monad. "But do you not know that&#xD;
scientific men have created conditions which have pro-.&#xD;
duced independent, and therefore unknown, undreamed&#xD;
of forms of animal life, as the acarus crossi, and others ?"&#xD;
This objection does not invalidate the truth, nor weak-&#xD;
en the force of the statement. All things have a use.&#xD;
Nothing has been made in vain. Even the most dis-&#xD;
gusting traits in animals, are matched . in the human ;&#xD;
and the poverty and squalor, the obscenity and loath-&#xD;
liness of many human beings, rival, nay, surpass their&#xD;
correspondents in the lower sentient world. Nature is'&#xD;
a system of precise conditions ; nor dare you say that&#xD;
there were not conditions that befell a monad or monads,&#xD;
in which the eternal law did not demand and secretly&#xD;
force the effort of the chemist, which resulted in the&#xD;
productions of an acarus, which may have afforded the&#xD;
necessary requirements of various monads, or human&#xD;
germ-souls, in one point of their career.&#xD;
All matter is alive with imprisoned spirit ; every&#xD;
globule of this latter, unique, and existing in inn umer-&#xD;
able folds, contains-a monad, a germ, concealing within&#xD;
itself capacities quite infinite in number and power.&#xD;
- During its long probation it ever seeks to escape its&#xD;
outer bonds, just as certain shell-fish and serpents cast&#xD;
their old envelopes. But in every stage of its unfold-&#xD;
ing, every monad expresses a lesser or higher phase of the&#xD;
one great thought of God--Personality, Coherence,&#xD;
Powc. Unity. All the characteristics of the floral,&#xD;
&#xD;
vegetable and animal kingdoms, are but elements of&#xD;
something higher, afterwards expressed in the human.&#xD;
Thus a fox means shrewdness--cunning, low    cun-&#xD;
nling ; and' that some men have not -yet outgrown&#xD;
their recollections and applications of fob-craft, is&#xD;
self-evident to the most casual observer. The ass&#xD;
is the natural symbol of patience, the cat of dupli-&#xD;
city, the lion of firmness ; an elephant stands as gener-&#xD;
osity, the horse is pride ; the peacock, vanity, the dog&#xD;
affection; and so on through an infinite scale of varia-&#xD;
tions. All living things are but developing monads,, at&#xD;
whose bottom slumbers-what will one day be an impe-&#xD;
rial human soul ! And these monads develope off their&#xD;
surfaces continually ; the longer and more varied the&#xD;
process, the more beautiful the grand result at each suc-&#xD;
cessive stage. Thus the monad whose highest manifes-&#xD;
tation ten thousand years ago, may have been a thistle,&#xD;
perchance looks pp to heaven this day from the glorious&#xD;
eyes of a rose-bush, or a dove. The great truth seems&#xD;
never to have been apprehended by the great army of&#xD;
those who have made thinking a business ; that while&#xD;
beasts, trees and flowers are not, as such, endowed with&#xD;
a specific immortality, yet at every stage of their being&#xD;
they constantly give off images of themselves, which are,&#xD;
and ever will be immortal. These images constitute&#xD;
the pictures of the soul-world ; but the essence, the in-&#xD;
nate force that developed that of which they are the&#xD;
representations, returns to God whence it started, a full&#xD;
and regal human soul. Thus it is seen how and why&#xD;
man is the culmination of nature, and is brother to the&#xD;
flower and the worm.&#xD;

in action) is a thought, shootout into the vast expanse,&#xD;
but destined to return by another paAthway, not di&#xD;
rest, but circuitous and spiral. Well, (says the-voice&#xD;
speaking from within to the philosopher who islisten-&#xD;
ing to the revelation) I was ,one of these monads;,ad&#xD;
found myself enveloped in a myriad folds and firmly im&#xD;
.bedded in a granite rock, where I remained shut up for&#xD;
long ages; pining constantly for deliverance from the&#xD;
thraldom. Even then I found my monad heart pulsing&#xD;
with a divine life, and ardently longed to celebrate&#xD;
the knowledge; for I knew I came from Deity, and&#xD;
longedfor my return.&#xD;
My first, recollections are of a fiery character, for&#xD;
my dwelling was in the very nucleus of" a comet that,&#xD;
had just been whirled into being. How ? I cannot&#xD;
now stop to explain. Only this will I. say : with me&#xD;
there were myriads of others, .for in every molecule of&#xD;
spiritual and material substance, was imbedded  n&amp;amp;6f&#xD;
my brethren, all longing to escape and return to the&#xD;
heart of God, whence we had been sent forth to per&#xD;
feet His great design.&#xD;
The comet cooled : became a world, and finally an&#xD;
earthquake threw the~block of granite w herein was I,&#xD;
to the surface; and bye-and-bye, after waiting many ages,&#xD;
I found room to move, and did so. The result was&#xD;
that we--the other monads and myself, changed our outer&#xD;
shells into moss. The moss died, and left us free to&#xD;
try what further we could do for be it known that our&#xD;
forces had not yet been fairly called into action. The&#xD;
next change was - a higher one, :and afforded scope for&#xD;
the display of a higher order of power. This time I&#xD;
became a plant; and the next time a plant.of a higher&#xD;

character; at -each epoch losing one coat;* until at last&#xD;
I could be plant no longer, and so was forced hy a law&#xD;
within, as well as laws without myself, to become the&#xD;
center of an animal. And so I ran the gamut of change&#xD;
through countless ages; every new condition being more&#xD;
and more favorable, brought out new properties from&#xD;
within me, and displayed new beauties to the sun's .&#xD;
bright eye. I was still a monad, and will ever be. such&#xD;
in one sense; albeit Time, after reaching my human form,&#xD;
will be of no account,-only states. Something whis-&#xD;
peredme that I should ever advance toward, but never&#xD;
reach perfection. I felt that, monad though I was,&#xD;
yet at my heart, my core, my center, I was the germ of&#xD;
an immortal human-soul, and that that soul itself was des-&#xD;
tined to throw off form after form after its material career&#xD;
was ended, just as I had all along the ages. And thus&#xD;
I passed through countless changes, exhibited a million&#xD;
characteristics, until at last,. I who had at first worn a&#xD;
body of fire, then of .granite, then of moss, now put on&#xD;
a higher and nobler dress, and became for the first time,&#xD;
self-conscious, intelligent, and in a degree, intuitive'&#xD;
both as to the past, the present, and the future. And&#xD;
all these infinite changes were effected by throwings 6ff,&#xD;
in regular order, just as material suns throw off ring&#xD;
after ring, which in turn resolve themselves into planet&#xD;
after planet. During all these transmigrationsmy monad&#xD;

isnot only found in the marvelous resemblances between human and&#xD;

meremother-marking, but gestation was interrupted in some respects in&#xD;
some way, at about the nineteenth day after conception, while it went&#xD;
on-normally in other respects. An additional proof of the truth of this&#xD;
development theory is seen in the fact that ordinary parents often-&#xD;

for the former is WITHIN, but the latter, like the&#xD;
planetary worlds, is WITHOUT ;-not in the sense, of in&#xD;
' the house and out of the house, but rather in the sense&#xD;
of in the bed and in a dream,-not exactly, but ana-&#xD;
logous. The fact is, mankind, albeit many know it not,&#xD;
are living upon the confines, at least, if not occasionally&#xD;
full residents of two or three worlds at-the same time-&#xD;
worlds which impinge upon, and interlace each other,&#xD;
just as -fine spirit contacts rough matter ; and yet,&#xD;
while this fact is so, it happens likewise that in many&#xD;
respects these worlds are as wide apart, and distant&#xD;
from each other, as is Pleiades from Mazaroth, or distant&#xD;
sun from twinkling planet ; for the reason that states,&#xD;
not miles, separate the denizens of either. Those whose&#xD;
being is in accord with the vast Harmonead, move alike&#xD;
upon the shores of each sphere of being, whence they&#xD;
can catch the echoes and foot-falls of the pilgrims on&#xD;
both banks. Most people are familiar with the stereo-&#xD;
typed assertion that 'Man is a microcosm-a universe&#xD;
in miniature,' than which nothing can be more correct&#xD;
and true. The body is not the man ; neither is the&#xD;
nerve-center of his brain that which constitutes his&#xD;
personality, any more ,than the central spiritual sun&#xD;
around which all material systems revolve, is the&#xD;
supreme God himself ; for even as Deity dwells within&#xD;
the centralia of that august luminary, so also does the&#xD;
very man himself hold his court within the bosom of&#xD;
that magic sphere which exists within his skull. In&#xD;
the subjoined description of the student,--(see part two&#xD;

full and complete. God is at once a center, a Republic&#xD;

of the supreme Ego is sovereign Lord and President,-&#xD;

despotic power over all within the great domain. So&#xD;

The WILL is Lord of man's accidents and incidents, and&#xD;

what I can find no descriptive term, good as that&#xD;
of Memorama, for such it truely was,-and the fact of&#xD;
its existence at all ought to become a significant one to&#xD;

on earth, even so will be the delights or agonies conse-&#xD;
quent upon their inspection of these memory tables on&#xD;
the other shore, whither all must go, whether the voy-&#xD;

cessantly altered their. aspect, or gave place to new&#xD;
ones, but there was something which did not change,&#xD;
but on the contrary seemed to gather weight and dura-&#xD;
bility all the while. This was the attention point,--&#xD;
the focalization of all the soul's observant powers, nor&#xD;
did it undergo any permutation whatever. I stood, as&#xD;
previously intimated, in the center of a crystaline&#xD;
sphere. ' It was translucent, but not transparent. No-&#xD;
thing beyond its glory-tinted Walls was discernible, but&#xD;
all within it stood revealed in grand and cryptic light,&#xD;
which, as already observed, appeared to proceed from&#xD;
my own head. ,The vertical diameter of this sphere&#xD;
was not more than fifty yards, its horizontal one some-&#xD;
what more,-for its form was slightly ellipsoidal: Its&#xD;
floor was as a polished -mirror, reflecting not only my&#xD;
own image, but those of all things else within its beau-&#xD;
tiful walls. In this mirror-like surface I beheld my&#xD;
person and features most distinctly; and it was quite&#xD;
a matter of surprise to discover that I was, without the&#xD;
slightest effort on my part, completely and beautifully&#xD;
clothed in garments of a. fashion and style which, of&#xD;
all others, I should have selected, had opportunity for&#xD;
so doing been presented. -Here is a new mystery of&#xD;
the Soul-world which may well engage the attention of&#xD;
Psychologians.- Depending from my neck and shoulders&#xD;
was a long and flowing robe, apparently seamless, and&#xD;
woven of lightest gossamer.  The fore-arms and left&#xD;
shoulder joint were bare, and I noticed that they, as&#xD;
well as my hands, had lost the sickly caste, and shrunk-&#xD;
en, shrivelled appearance formerly characterizing them.&#xD;
Now, to my great delight, they were fair, plump, andof&#xD;
the most dazzling and voluptuous mould' and propor-&#xD;

&#xD;
tions. As I made this happy discovery; there flashed&#xD;
across me something of the deeper meanings slumber-&#xD;
ing beneath the phrases "love, loving, and lovely ;"&#xD;
and I could comprehend why one person should become&#xD;
so en rapport, so obsessed with, and possessed and ab-&#xD;
sorbed by another, as to lose not only all self-control,,&#xD;
but self altogether. I could now understand why the&#xD;
most loving must ever remain apart, even in the most&#xD;
interior communion on earth,-until there, are no dull&#xD;
senses to be bridged, and understand the amazing differ-&#xD;
ence between a love that seeks its solace through sense,&#xD;
and that which brings souls together. While people,&#xD;
are enwrapped in flesh and blood, love is often obliged&#xD;
to express itself in modes distasteful to its higher nature,&#xD;
and unworthy of itself. Not so in the Soul-world; for&#xD;
there the very joy (magnetic, if you please,) which one&#xD;
lover feels in the mere presence of the other, reaches a&#xD;
point of fullness, completion and intensity that mere&#xD;
nervous filaments are incapable of conveying, mere ner-&#xD;
vous exhalations can never give. No body is capable&#xD;
either of giving or receiving, even with the strongest&#xD;
efforts of will, even a foretaste of the joys which the&#xD;
soul, freed therefrom, can and does spontaneously. The&#xD;
keenest Sybarite,-the finest-nerved voluptuary can&#xD;
have no adequate conception, either of the nature or,&#xD;
the depth of the joy imparted mutually by two loving&#xD;
souls in the higher worlds. Love, I have said, I knew&#xD;
but little of, and cared less for, previous to my de-&#xD;
parture ; but now, as I gazed upon myself, and realized&#xD;
for ;what I was intended, there arose a something with-&#xD;
in assuring me of my boundless-limitless capacity to&#xD;
and for love. And then the gentle hint-of Nellie came&#xD;
&#xD;
back, and had the mate, assigned me then appeared, I&#xD;
do not think'he would have met a very cold reception.&#xD;
Thereafter all this ended as God decreed it should-&#xD;
rightly.&#xD;
Around my waist there was a zone or belt of blue;&#xD;
which kept the fronts of my open robe together,&#xD;
and then fell floorward in two knotted tassels on the&#xD;
left side. The throat and upper portions of my bosom&#xD;
were covered with what bore the appearance of finest&#xD;
lace, whiter than the driven snow. The hair hung in&#xD;
luxuriant-curl-tresses adown my back and cheeks, which&#xD;
latter, as disclosed by the floor-mirror, were no longer&#xD;
sunken, sallow or emaciated in the least degree; on&#xD;
the contrary they were round, full, white, fair as the&#xD;
cheeks of daylight, and suffused with the softest and&#xD;
most delicate tints of the newly-opened blossom of the&#xD;
peach tree. The teeth !--I had teeth--were ivory-&#xD;
hued, large and even. The eyes were larger than they'&#xD;
had ever seemed before ; their lashes were long, dark&#xD;
and drooping; and they were shaded by a brow far&#xD;
more delicate and finely pencilled than they ever were&#xD;
on earth. My stature was a trifle less,. apparently,&#xD;
than when incarnated, and there was a health, vigor,&#xD;
and' freshness, which reminded me of the early days,&#xD;
ere woman's estateiiad come with all its cares and&#xD;
toils, its miseries and deep griefs. About my head there&#xD;
was a. shining band, like unto 'the spirit of  sver&#xD;
coronet, pearl and diamond frosted, and flashkigSack&#xD;
the light from a thousand jeweled points. In the center&#xD;
of this zone was a triangle of ruby hue, surmounted&#xD;
with the-cypher " R," and in its center was a crystalige&#xD;
globe, winged, and bearing the motto, "TRY."&#xD;

&#xD;
Curiosity is the soul of advancement ; it is a female&#xD;
element almost exclusively; and though all else forsake&#xD;
wojnan, curiosity never will, either on earth or any-&#xD;
where else. It prompted me to the investigations&#xD;
above recounted, and to others which followed hard&#xD;
thereon. I wondered how my feet and ankles looked /&#xD;
The desire was no sooner formed than gratified. The&#xD;
latter were encased in proper attire, but the former&#xD;
not quite so, for instead of a shoe, as I expected to find,&#xD;
there was only a sort of sandal,-a mere sole, light&#xD;
and graceful, fitting perfectly,' and seemingly kept in&#xD;
place by narrow red bands, which were laced to the&#xD;
ankles and over the foot and instep. -The bands them-&#xD;
selves seemed to be of a material no coarser than cords&#xD;
of braided light. Such, in brief, were the revealments&#xD;
of the mirror. "Mirror !" exclaims the reader, "why&#xD;
mirrors are adapted only to solar light, and that which&#xD;
proceeds from material combustion. They reflect from&#xD;
- their polished surfaces, according to the well-known&#xD;
laws of optics, which laws cannot possibly obtain of&#xD;
the strange world of which you were then an occupant,&#xD;
-which realm lies above and beyond the sphere of&#xD;
their action or influence ; how then could you see the&#xD;
image of yourself ? "  Again: "  If the first suit of&#xD;
apparel in which you found yourself after death, were&#xD;
only mere appearances, of what nature or character&#xD;
were these last? If the spirit of a human being is,&#xD;
as we are led to infer from your narrative, in nowise&#xD;
physical; or even hyper-physical, as the Spiritualists&#xD;
assert-and they claim to know all about the matter,&#xD;
-if it is only a phantasmal projection from the vERY&#xD;
sout,-an out-attachment of the supreme self, how do&#xD;
&#xD;
you reconcile your statements concerning 'blue-caste&#xD;
hands, wrinkled epidermis, shrivelled appearance,' and&#xD;
so on, with your subsequent assertions that they after-&#xD;
wards became fair, plump and beautiful? Do. shadows&#xD;
grow? Do phantasms avail themselves of the law of&#xD;
increment ? Please explain ; clear up, elucidate 1"&#xD;
REPLY : These are the very points concerning which&#xD;
the people need light ; for assuredly that which they&#xD;
have heretofore received, instead of illumining the sub-&#xD;
jects under consideration, have tended directly to in-&#xD;
crease the already dense obscurity, and only rendered&#xD;
the darkness still more palpable and dense. In order&#xD;
to a clear- conception of what lies before us, it will be&#xD;
well to remind each other that both soul and body act&#xD;
under the impetus of two -distinct codes of law : the&#xD;
one volitional, the other mechanical, and therefore in-&#xD;
voluntary. An illustration of both is seen in the case&#xD;
of a man, who either reading a book or earnestly con-&#xD;
versing s he moves alopg, takes no notice whatever of&#xD;
passing p sons or things, and yet pursues the direct&#xD;
path, nor oice misses his way.. Both laws are operating&#xD;
simultaneously. The bodily, powers are under the same&#xD;
government ; for the heart beats, digestion proceeds,&#xD;
and all the functions of the physical economy are&#xD;
carried on by a power lying altogether back of will.&#xD;
There is also another 'law, which from voluntary, at&#xD;
length comes to manifest itself altogether involuntarily.&#xD;
I refer to the law of Habit. Now that this law governs&#xD;
both soul and body is proved by a simple reference to&#xD;
_ the swearing man, who also drinks liquor, chews to-&#xD;
bacco, falls asleep at a given hour and wakes up at an-&#xD;
other. Whosoever hums a tune often, will at length&#xD;

be haunted by it, and cannot rid himself. of the tor-&#xD;
menting tune-fiend by even the most strenuous resolve and&#xD;
effort to do so. It, like a fever, must, and will run its&#xD;
course. .We also habituate ourselves to certain forms&#xD;
of expression, and ideal associations. Thus much by&#xD;
way of preface.&#xD;
Now it was the involuntary obedience of my. soul to&#xD;
the Habit-law, that caused it to array itself in the sem-&#xD;
blance of the old and well-remembered dress.   The&#xD;
law of the association of ideas, gave the 'blue caste,'&#xD;
the wrinkles and the emaciation which so surprised me.&#xD;
Presently, however, I passed under the operation of&#xD;
higher laws of nature, and more interior ones of my&#xD;
own immortal soul. One of the first, and most im-&#xD;
portant of these last, is the law of Vastation-where-&#xD;
by the soul throws off the old loves, preparatory to&#xD;
entering upon new ones. Its first involuntary act, in&#xD;
the second, as in the first case, was to clothe itself ;&#xD;
but no longedsubject to the old law of association, and&#xD;
coming under a new one, it rejected the- things of&#xD;
memory, and assumed the garb corresponding to its&#xD;
new-born loves,-all in conformity to a law within it-&#xD;
self. [In dreams, the garb and surroundings are&#xD;
typical' or -symbolic of mental, moral and,, esthetic&#xD;
states: therefore it is possible to construct an exact&#xD;
science of dream-interpretation.] And the drapery as-&#xD;
sumed was not merely the 'result of caprice or an in-&#xD;
voluntary fantastic taste, pride or vainness, but was&#xD;
the legitimate and orderly result of the triple law,&#xD;
whose elements are fitness, expression, and correspond-&#xD;
ence.  The white drapery symbolized, if not my ab-&#xD;
solute purity, at least my aspirations thitherward,-&#xD;
&#xD;
(and this explains why all men and women array their&#xD;
breasts in white bosoms, frills and laces.) The bandeau,&#xD;
the zone, girdle, jewels, all symbolized an affection, as-&#xD;
piration or quality of the inner being ; and as these&#xD;
latter change, so also do the former. The law is im-&#xD;
perative, because it is a thing of the soul itself, whose&#xD;
external manifestations invariably-in the soul-world---&#xD;
represent its inward states : moral, religious and in-&#xD;
tellectual.&#xD;
In the light of this explanation, therefore, no one&#xD;
need marvel at the radical changes in my personal ap-&#xD;
pearance. We shall throw much more light on the&#xD;
general subject when next we treat of the mysteries of&#xD;
being. The present undertaking being merely pre-&#xD;
fatory, as a matter of course, confines us to the mere&#xD;
superficialities of a realm whose vastness exceeds all&#xD;
human conception. In reference to the wrinkles of my&#xD;
hands, and their sudden disappearance, enough has been&#xD;
said ; yet for the information of whoso chooses to profit&#xD;
by it, I will merely add here, that as Time only affects&#xD;
man in his outward relations, it cannot, of course, bring&#xD;
wrinkles on his features, for souls do not grow old by&#xD;
years; albeit they do grow old by experiences,-without&#xD;
reference to duration, but only as to depth and intensity.&#xD;
A. single weekof mental agony yill ripen a soul far&#xD;
more than would fifty centuries of clock-beats, passed&#xD;
free from the sorrows aforesaid.&#xD;
Let it not be forgotten that there are two distinct&#xD;
and dissimilar worlds beyond the grave, nor that.I had&#xD;
rapidly crossed from the first to the second stage of my&#xD;
transmundane existence. One of these is the mere ex-&#xD;
. ternal world of. Spirits, wherein a life, analogous to&#xD;

&#xD;
that of earth is for a period led by the inhabitants&#xD;
thereof. 'The other is that, concerning the mysteries&#xD;
whereof, I am now treating.&#xD;
Millions of beings there are who, although disrobed&#xD;
of fleshly garments, are yet pilgrims in search of the&#xD;
soul-world. The latter is divine and interior, the&#xD;
former natural and merely Spiritual. A man on earth&#xD;
may gaze on the surface of a picture, or mechanically&#xD;
read a book, and yet find nothing therein ; whereas&#xD;
either of these may lead another person not only into&#xD;
their own beauty-depths, and into the soul of the painter&#xD;
or the author.; but they may serve as clues which his&#xD;
soul-may seize on and follow into realms never even&#xD;
imagined to exist by the poet-painter, or the painter-&#xD;
poet. So also the mere mortuary fact by no means&#xD;
serves as a free ticket or pass into the grand Temple,&#xD;
at the mere vestibule of which grim Death lands those&#xD;
who take passage in the phantom shallop,,whereof him-&#xD;
self is pilot and steersman. The mere post mortem exist-&#xD;
ence does not necessarily entitle one to all the privileges&#xD;
of the Temple, nor make one a resident of,- or even&#xD;
spectator of the worlds of Soul. True, there will occur&#xD;
a change in all, whereby they can pass the mystic ferry ;&#xD;
but this change must be worked out from within, and&#xD;
in no wise depend upon outside influences,; it must be&#xD;
volitional, not mechanical. The ferriage must be paid&#xD;
in well-wishing and better doing.. The life beyond is&#xD;
a real one, compared to which that of earth is a mere&#xD;
shadow, and the form of Government is an isonomous&#xD;
one ; equal rights, equal laws, impartial justice, ad-&#xD;
ministered, not by external agents of an outward power,&#xD;
but by the very constitutional delegates from the secret&#xD;
&#xD;
soul itself; for no justice is so very just as that which&#xD;
each soul, by virtue of its own. nature, administers to&#xD;
itself, and through which its lower becomes subordinated&#xD;
to its higher and nobler faculties, qualities and powers.&#xD;
And this is the law that keeps many a one from enter-&#xD;
ing the sacred penetralia until properly disciplined&#xD;
and prepared for the change.&#xD;
I wondered at first why these truths were not more&#xD;
.generally known and appreciated by the people, who,&#xD;
because they have an intellectual perception of the fact&#xD;
of immortality, call themselves "Spiritualists ; " but as&#xD;
the veil was slowly drawn away, and I saw that much&#xD;
that had to ime appeared real, proved now to be but&#xD;
seeming.; there was no more marveling. There was,&#xD;
still is, and for a long time will be, four sorts of Spirit-&#xD;
ualism in the world : First,' a mere bodily sensitiveness,&#xD;
nervous acuteness, and susceptibility to magnetic&#xD;
emanations and impressions,-out of which arises a&#xD;
great deal of the stagnant filth and social corruptions so&#xD;
prevalent,-the debaucheries and license, and great evils&#xD;
which pain so greatly the hearts of true men and wo-&#xD;
men. Second, a Spiritualism of the brain alone ;-a&#xD;
cerebral quickening,-a hot-house ripening of faculty,&#xD;
which gives rise to much talking, and sometimes leads&#xD;
to the discovery of many of the elements of'the great&#xD;
principia underlying the Harmonead, and prophecies&#xD;
the good time that is yet to be. Third, "compact"&#xD;
Spiritualism, or that wherein and whereby a certain&#xD;
class of sensitives, be they male or female, become the&#xD;
dupes of their own folly, and the victims of disembodied&#xD;
maniacs, lunatics and self-deluded denizens of the middle&#xD;
state-Spirits who wander on the outskirts of three&#xD;

&#xD;
worlds, without a permanent resting-place in either.&#xD;
These have been useful, however, inasmuch as they have&#xD;
called, and even compelled attention to phenomena&#xD;
which they produce, and which cannot be explained&#xD;
away, nor accounted for, save by admitting two things ;&#xD;
first, that immortality is a fixed fact ; and second, that&#xD;
it is possible to bridge the. hitherto impassable chasm&#xD;
which divides earth from regions which lie beyond.&#xD;
The fourth kind, and truest and best, indeed that which&#xD;
only is truely spiritual, is the growing up into a spiritual-&#xD;
ized, out of the merely physical selfhood ; and this&#xD;
growth of soul necessarily admits the subject of it into&#xD;
the mysteries of being, precisely in accordance with the&#xD;
degree of the person's own unfolding. It is the off-&#xD;
spring of good resolutions, well and faithfully carried&#xD;
out ; ignores pride, talk, lust, hatred, envy, malice, slan-&#xD;
der, and all else which characterizes the other three&#xD;
sorts. Immortality is to such, not an acquired, but an&#xD;
intuitive fact. Such Spiritualists are good, moral, hu-&#xD;
mane, charitable, merciful, kind and true ; religious,&#xD;
Christian in deed, as well as name ; and such as these&#xD;
are never pulling down, but ever building up the Good,&#xD;
the Beautiful, and the True ; and when such an one dies,&#xD;
his or her stay in the Middle.State is very short, for&#xD;
they have paid their ferriage, and are speedily intro-&#xD;
mitted to the mysteries and grandeurs of the world of&#xD;
Soul.&#xD;
Such an one is unfolded ; and by this term is not&#xD;
meant that state to which a man arrives after packing&#xD;
the contents of two or three libraries on the shelves of&#xD;
his memory ; by that term is not meant the condition&#xD;
of one who has arrived at honor and distinction by dint&#xD;
&#xD;
of mere acquaintance with learned authorities, and the&#xD;
accumulation and piling up of knowledge of various&#xD;
common and popular sorts ; for it frequently happens&#xD;
that men and women, who are very ignorant of all&#xD;
these things,--and who, so far as they are concerned,&#xD;
are not "progressed " at all, prove on -trial to be far&#xD;
more "unfolded" than thousands of those who have&#xD;
grown gray in the service of Letters, and who have,&#xD;
by persistent assiduity succeeded in transforming them-&#xD;
selves from human beings into locomotive encyclopedias&#xD;
-splendid to look at, interesting to dine with and talk&#xD;
to-but cold, unheartful encyclopedias after all. Edu-&#xD;
cation is often a mere mechanical mastery of useless&#xD;
abstrusities,-coins, which on the social counters jingle&#xD;
well,-but which are not over and above current in the&#xD;
far-off worlds,-where a boor's earnest prayer weighs&#xD;
far more than the ornate, rhapsodical orisons of scores&#xD;
of learned pedants, who, to judge them by their lan-&#xD;
guage, take God to be a school committee, rather than&#xD;
a loving, tender Parent.&#xD;
Thus I found true,-what had previously been surmised,&#xD;
that a person may know but little,-yet approach much&#xD;
nearer the Divine, than one who has more brain furni-&#xD;
ture, with a great deal less heart.&#xD;
It was revealed to my understanding that the great&#xD;
- law of Vastation, by whose operation the monad de-&#xD;
veloped moss, threw it off, and brought forth something&#xD;
better and higher, until at last the conscious pointr-the&#xD;
truly human degree-was, after the lapEe of, ages,&#xD;
reached, did not cease its functions even after the death&#xD;
of the body, albeit its mode .of action was somewhat&#xD;
changed and modified ; for now it was observed by me,&#xD;

remains to be thrown off, as it has been doing ever since&#xD;
the clock, of.Time struck one upon the bell on Eternity's&#xD;
tower ! It will continue the process until that tower&#xD;
itself shall topple and fall with hoary ageI&#xD;
The figure of an onion, though a homely, is neverthe-&#xD;
less a good one, inasmuch as it offers a familiar illustra-&#xD;
tion of the monad ; for, first, there is the two or three&#xD;
external skins, after which comes layer after layer, until&#xD;
at last we find a center, which center contains an invisi-&#xD;
ble, because a spiritual point, which constitutes the&#xD;
germ or seed-principle, containing, latent in its bosom,&#xD;
countless acres of onions, that are and are not, at the&#xD;
same time-fields of plenty, seeds of mighty harvests,&#xD;
which only need the necessary conditions to prove their&#xD;
power and develop their capacities.&#xD;
Philosophers have long sought, with their crude plum-&#xD;
mets, to sound the bottomless abysses of man's immortal&#xD;
soul. Spiritualists, in their turn; have tried' to do the&#xD;
same-aye ! and loudly boasted of their success. Suc-&#xD;
cess, forsooth ! Why their lead, even when all the line&#xD;
attached thereto was well run out, rested, on one or&#xD;
more of [the very 'topmost ledges of the unfathoma-&#xD;
ble and vast profound-their weights only lodged on&#xD;
the upper crags of one or more of the tiniest moun-&#xD;
&#xD;
tains, whose heads are upreared from the floor of the&#xD;
great ocean Soul. Proclaiming man to be a world in&#xD;
miniature, they have, in their treatment of him and his,&#xD;
not only belied and stultified themselves, but have&#xD;
shown that, after all, ho was to be classed with "all&#xD;
other worms of the dust"-a semi-voluntary automa-&#xD;
ton--a skip-jack, to be coaxed, wheedled and driven,&#xD;
just as circumstances might dictate and decree. Theo-&#xD;
retically, to them, he is a God ; practically, a mere ma-&#xD;
chine, whose office and function it is to eat, drink, be&#xD;
merry, sleep, wake up, labor, and beget his kind-whose&#xD;
destiny, in turn, it is to repeat the same identical round,&#xD;
with perhaps a few trifling and unimportant varia-&#xD;
tions-totally forgetful or unconscious of the fact, that&#xD;
when pronouncing him to be a microcosm, they were&#xD;
uttering a sentence brimfull of God's everlasting truth.&#xD;
Philosophers have a bad habit of saying one thing and&#xD;
meaning another ; for while loudly declaring, they never&#xD;
yet have fairly believed, that howsoever vast the ui-&#xD;
verses without may be, yet all and each of them grow&#xD;
diminutive and contracted when compared with those&#xD;
that exist within the Soul. Nay, they have never real-&#xD;
ized that all that has a being outside of man is met, mas-&#xD;
tered and overmatched by an infinite universe from&#xD;
within!/&#xD;
Crime ! folly !-what are they.? Philosopher, an-&#xD;
swer thou me! "They are, they are-they are-well,&#xD;
I can hardly tell -what they really are." I will tell&#xD;
you: these things frequently mark the career of the&#xD;
'Progressed' man-never that of the developed or un-&#xD;

impulse, Spirit-obsession, or of a bad calculation. When&#xD;

nations merely 'Progress,' every jail-yard has its gib-'&#xD;
bet ; when the people are 'Unfolded,' temples for God-&#xD;
worship take their places. Philosophers try to explain&#xD;
away all crime and evil, knowing it to be real ; yet at&#xD;
the same time treat the doers of ill-deeds as if they were&#xD;
not fitter subjects for soul-hospitals than for thumb-&#xD;
screws and disgrace. They forget that society gains&#xD;
nothing by making a man think less of himself ! In-&#xD;
stead of pursuing really reformatory methods with those&#xD;
who are vicious or whose souls are sick, they have&#xD;
favored the policy of revenge and atonement, and&#xD;
adopted the lex talionis instead of the lex jutitice-&#xD;
as Common Sense; if nothing else, would 'ever seem to&#xD;
dictate, counsel, and approve.&#xD;
The Social Harmonead is yet to be. Discord rules&#xD;
the age. The human soul is unbalanced. Equilibrium&#xD;
and Virtue come together. By-and-by, Philosophers&#xD;
will realize this truth. Men who gaze intently on the&#xD;
wonderful perfection of the outer Harmonead, and&#xD;
realize its -vast excellence, constantly fail to recognize&#xD;
the fact that the inner world of man would be the same&#xD;
were but Charity and kindly dealing, in thought as well&#xD;
as act, to take precedence of Suspicion and Punishment.&#xD;
As yet the world is but a baby-realm. There are no&#xD;
real saints therein at present, for the reason that the&#xD;
currents of the time are not adapted to the floating of&#xD;
that species of craft ; nor will the social gardens pro-&#xD;
duce that sort of fruit until it is well subsoiled by char-&#xD;

what the soil may be, it can produce none but beauty-&#xD;

as the present into the account-is the sin against him&#xD;
or herself, society. will rapidly purge itself of wrong,&#xD;
and there will be fewer bad memories to haunt and ter-&#xD;
rify them afterlife's troublous drama shall end, and far&#xD;

floors of the world of Soul.&#xD;
Wealth, the possession of riches, is, on earth and in&#xD;
all human society, the universal passport to honor and&#xD;
distinction. This is one of the fallacies of man, and the&#xD;
greatest ; but the good deeds done to the neighbor and,&#xD;
the self are hereafter changed into a kind of coin read-&#xD;
ily current in the lands beyond the tomb.&#xD;
i Now no one thing yet unaccomplished is more certain&#xD;
to come to pass, than that this lesson will yet be learned&#xD;
by the people. When it is mastered, there will be far&#xD;
less strife for the honors and emoluments of office, and&#xD;
the universal cry will be, 'Whom can we get, who shall&#xD;
.we persuade to be our Ruler, President, or King ?'&#xD;
'Who can we employ to fill those offices ?' instead of&#xD;
'Vote for me !' as now. Mankind on earth do not, as,&#xD;
we of the Soul-world, seek for joys that are pure, and&#xD;
purely human, too ; they do not, as we, drink from cha-&#xD;
lices at whose bottom no dregs are found after-the ruby&#xD;
wine has been sipped. Alas, no ! but, instead, they&#xD;

&#xD;
seek for such joys as are absolutely sure to leave a sting&#xD;
behind, and Repentance, Agony and Remorse are the&#xD;
terrible triplet they are obliged to ,nurse, for 0 how&#xD;
long! This is moral and spiritual suicide-so far as&#xD;
super-mundane joys are concerned-suicide, slow but&#xD;
sure ; and such souls, on entering the Middle State, are&#xD;
poor, and thin, and lean, and powerless, for deeds or&#xD;
thoughts either good or great ; and memory reflects&#xD;
back but few, if any pleasant images, but, in lieu there-&#xD;
of, presents for inspection and as food for contempla-&#xD;
tion, an array of barren mountains, fierce whirlpools,&#xD;
crags toppling over into dreadful darkness, beetling&#xD;
cliffs, from whose bald summits the vulture and the&#xD;
night-owl shriek and scream. No pleasant pasture lands&#xD;
begem  the picture--no sweetly-singing rivers of de-&#xD;
light-but only things of wierdness, rage and fury, set as&#xD;
centers into pictures representing boisterous and tem-&#xD;
pestuous seas, cold,- and dreary ice-islands, or desert&#xD;
sands which swallow up the sunshine, the moisture and&#xD;
the rain, but. never smile with a single green or lovely&#xD;
thing. These are symbols and similes of the Soul's&#xD;
states, and are the legitimate and inevitable out-crea-&#xD;
tions of itself; but, thank God! not of its inner deeps,&#xD;
else the universe might well run mad, and every living&#xD;
thing curse its God and-die. True it is that, none of&#xD;
these frightful things are the results of the natural and&#xD;
unbiassed choice of any human creature, yet they are&#xD;
none the less real in the second stage of existence, for&#xD;
the reason that Destiny forever compels a man to be&#xD;
himself. Sooner, or later he-will bring himself volun-&#xD;
tarily to acknowledge, bow, and bend before it ; and&#xD;
the instant that he does so, the grand Vastatory law&#xD;
&#xD;

comes into play, and he slowly emerges from Hell, and&#xD;
takes the road to Heaven!&#xD;
So far in human history on the'earth, the Devil has&#xD;
proved a tailure-utter, total and complete. Not so&#xD;
Evil. This latter works out its mission well, even if it&#xD;
does no more than to convince man that his only, best&#xD;
and truest friends are himself and the Infinite God&#xD;
whose child he is.&#xD;
In the higher realms, to which mankind is destined,&#xD;
his actions are never the result of an applied force from&#xD;
outside himself; but when voluntarily submitting to&#xD;
the pressure from within, he is irresistibly led from bad&#xD;
to better, and from better tp BEST. Reaching this&#xD;
point, h no logger rebels-ndt against God, but against&#xD;
himself--his higher, nobler, better nature-but, giving&#xD;
up all of mere self, begins to desire nothing so much as&#xD;
to love and be loved, to serve God and minister unto&#xD;
others' good-and at last finds himself standing in the&#xD;
Door of the Dawn, having emerged 'from the Hades of&#xD;
his own and others' making, and stepped into his house&#xD;
not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens-house-&#xD;
spheres such as I have partially described, prepared r,&#xD;
and in, and of him, from the foundations of the Ages-&#xD;
houses which are indeed 'builded upon very pleasant&#xD;
spots, on sunny glades and love-tinted hillocks on God's&#xD;
.Eternal Domain-houses, too, which men often refuse to&#xD;
enter and occupy till after the lapse of years of misery&#xD;
spent in the horrid caves and unsightly huts dug and&#xD;
builded' by themselves.&#xD;
All these things flashed in upon my soul, as I stood&#xD;
gazing into the mirror on the floor, and upon the-vivo-&#xD;

&#xD;
every event of my life, no matter how trivial, was&#xD;
clearly represented. Not a good thought or deed, no&#xD;
matter how private-not a single sin, no matter how&#xD;
venial--but was there reproduced for my inspection and&#xD;
instruction--moving, with all their foregone accessories,&#xD;
across the walls of that magic globe. They were living&#xD;
icons, perfect rescripts, of all foredeeds, thoughts, ac-&#xD;
tions----and transcripts, all too faithful, of the volumes&#xD;
of my memory. Soon all this passed along----the last&#xD;
scene being that of my death within the chamber of the&#xD;
house upon the hill. Scarcely had it vanished, whither&#xD;
I knew not, than a blank section moved across.'the line&#xD;
of vision, almost instantly succeeded by a Phantorama&#xD;
still more wondrous and imposing. Instead of repre-&#xD;
senting myself alone, this second picture revealed the&#xD;
results, both direct and indirect, of my personal influ-&#xD;
ence upon others, whether exerted in a domestic, social,&#xD;
or professional capacity. I could not help being par-&#xD;
ticularly struck with- one tableau, which, as it embodies&#xD;
a moral lesson, I will here stop to briefly describe:&#xD;
I saw myself in the act of warm disputation with a&#xD;
friend, on a subject well calculated to elici( the best&#xD;
thought of the best thinker. I had the right of the&#xD;
argument, and this was so apparent that my friend with&#xD;
whom I was arguing lost temper. At the time of the&#xD;
occurrence, I took but little note of the matter, not&#xD;
deeming it a subject of very great importance. Now,&#xD;
however, I saw, what surprised 'me greatly, that this&#xD;
mental excitement had reacted physically, and, in rin-&#xD;
ning its course, brought on a slight inflammation of the&#xD;
brain-a sort of slow but positive fever, which, while&#xD;
not confining the patient, yet affected both soul and&#xD;
&#xD;
body to a great extent, and so modified the cerebral&#xD;
constituents, that the immortal soul therein dwelling&#xD;
for a season, could not thereafter manifest itself as for-&#xD;
merly. I now realized that chemistry, in the higher&#xD;
sense, was an efficient force in the human mental, as&#xD;
well as in the material economy----that changes in the&#xD;
physical cells of the, brain could be made by intellectual&#xD;
excitations, and that these in a great measure affect&#xD;
the mental and, psychical operations, even to the extent&#xD;
of a complete bouleversement. In consequence of the&#xD;
change effected in the individual alluded to, projects&#xD;
of various kinds, previously determined on, had to be -&#xD;
given up-;--for which reason the entire current of a life&#xD;
was turned completely ; nor is it for me to say whether&#xD;
greater good or ill will be the ultimate or final rcesult----&#xD;
for the reason that as yet I can neither see the origin&#xD;
nor end. These are only known bj the Infinite One&#xD;
above us and beyond. Suffice it, therefore, to observe,,&#xD;
that had I known what weight inhered in words, whether&#xD;
lightly, harshly or kindly spoken, especially to the sen-&#xD;
sitive and susceptible natures of many of earth's pil-&#xD;
grims, never would I have uttered a syllable without&#xD;
well weighing the possible consequences thereof ; espe-&#xD;
cially would I have kept back all which bore the slight-&#xD;
est resemblance to heat or anger. '0, what a wondrous&#xD;
thing is a human soul ! Until now it was not clear to&#xD;
me that, by virtue of both a static and dynamic law of&#xD;
the universe, human happiness is derivative, and ever&#xD;
depends upon the amount and kind bestowed-upon or&#xD;
imparted to another. The law is dual, that is, it works&#xD;
both ways ; for even as a man or woman finds joy in&#xD;
the act of causing or of bringing joy to others, so also&#xD;

&#xD;
the misery and woe which A may cause B, C, D and&#xD;
E to feel or undergo, not only reacts upon A by force&#xD;
and virtue of the great Sympathia, but it is utterly im-&#xD;
possible for A to be happy, so long as the least trace of&#xD;
his or her action mauvaise remains with B, C, D, E, F&#xD;
and G. Nor is this all ; for if these last persons act&#xD;
badly toward H, I, J and K, said actions being the&#xD;
legitimate result of A's, originally, upon B, C, D, E, F&#xD;
and G, then A cannot escape the consequences, no mat-&#xD;
ter how distant or in whatever corner of God's universe&#xD;
he may be, or in whatever crevice of the great creation&#xD;
:he may seek to hide. A wave or ray of agony from B,&#xD;
C, and-the rest of the alphabet, will finally reach him!&#xD;
A lash from the great whip of conscience or remorse&#xD;
will fall on him, when rocks and mountains, though&#xD;
heart-implored, refuse to. Until tie law of compensa-.&#xD;
tion is satisfied, he shall never fail to hear, peeling into&#xD;
his soul from the lacerated hearts of others, the terrific&#xD;
sentence: 'Thou art the man ! thou hast done it ! Pay&#xD;
what thou owest !' If the reflections shall prove to&#xD;
have been good instead -of evil, then the words which&#xD;
shall be heard will be: 'Even as thou hast done it unto&#xD;
the least of these, my servants, thou hast done it unto&#xD;
me. Well done, thou good and faithful servant ! enter&#xD;
thou into the joy of thy Lord ! Take up thine abode in&#xD;
the mansions of bliss, prepared from the foundations of&#xD;
the world!' The coin of heaven is ever stamped with&#xD;
the seal of a person's deeds, be they good or evil.&#xD;
This soul-law is well illustrated by an anecdote which&#xD;
I remember to have heard related prior to my entrance&#xD;
into the wonderful realm, whereof I now found myself&#xD;
&#xD;
a denizen. The story was related by a male friend.&#xD;
Said he:&#xD;
",Many years ago, when a mere lad of ten or a dozen&#xD;
years, I lived in the Metropolis of America, where also&#xD;
I was born. One day several lads of us were playing&#xD;
at ball in a street then called 'Chapel,' but since known&#xD;
as West Broadway. In throwing the toy at one of my&#xD;
playmates, it missed him, and crashed through the win-&#xD;
dow of a shoe-mender's shop, the proprietor of which be-&#xD;
came greatly enraged, and in a paroxysm of fury not&#xD;
only cursed and swore most dreadfully at us, but also&#xD;
seized the offending ball, and threw it on his burning&#xD;
grate ; we, poor mourners, in the mean while looking&#xD;
down into the fiery grave of all our sport. Tears, ex-&#xD;
postulations, and entreaties were all so much wasted&#xD;
breath, and proved utterly unavailing. The ball, un-&#xD;
fortunate ball, was irrevocably doomed to an igneous&#xD;
tomb; nor could all our prayers, joined as they were,&#xD;
to abundant offers on our part, and that of several&#xD;
pitying on-lookers, to doubly pay the cost of the de-&#xD;
molished glass, soften the obdurate heart of the revenge-&#xD;
ful cobbler in the least degree. Burn that ball he swore&#xD;
to ; utterly consume it he vowed to, and most religiously&#xD;
he kept his promise.&#xD;
The ball was burned, but as the smoke of its' sub-&#xD;
stance,-the remains of two worn-out stockings and&#xD;
an india-rubber shoe,-and of our torment, went- up&#xD;
towards heaven, there accompanied it a most dire threat&#xD;
of vengeance from out my boyish heart,-proud, indig-&#xD;
nant little human heart, which then, for the first time,&#xD;
swelled almost to bursting with vindictiveness and rage.&#xD;
In my paroxysm of fury I swore a vendetta more fierce&#xD;

&#xD;
and terrible than that of the Orsini against their mortal&#xD;
foes, the Borgias of sunny Italia. I resolved to kill,&#xD;
slay, totally extinguish the whole race of cobblers,&#xD;
but that one in particular. His doom was, to be billed,&#xD;
slain, cut to pieces, remorselessly and cruelly murder-&#xD;
ed, after which his soul' was to be .eternally damned,&#xD;
roasted, stewed, broiled and grilled for evermore, upon&#xD;
the gridirons of the infernal'pit-all for burning a six-&#xD;
penny ball ! For ten long days and nights I pondered&#xD;
on the subject, and sought to contrive means whereby&#xD;
to carry out my philanthropic design. Having heard,&#xD;
and read of battles, bloodshed and gory fields of human&#xD;
slaughter, wherein he who did the most murder was&#xD;
the greatest hero ; having heard and read of human&#xD;
butchers and butchery, my heart had turned from the&#xD;
one, and I shuddered at the picture of the other. Now&#xD;
however, all these images of horror returned. I still&#xD;
hated them, but of all others, it seemed to me that that&#xD;
ball-burning shoe-mender was the most atrocious fiend&#xD;
that ever trod the earth. In my boyish frenzy I vowed&#xD;
he was an ogre, giant, demon, and all else that was&#xD;
horrible and bad, to rid the earth of whom would be&#xD;
doing an especial and particular favor to God, nature&#xD;
and human kind. Amidst all the scourges and pests&#xD;
who had ever trod the earth from Ghengis Khan to&#xD;
Lord Jeffries, not one loomed up who was half so cri-&#xD;
minal, half so deserving of the intensest scorn and&#xD;
maledictions of the human race, as was that unfortunate&#xD;
and guilty cobbler. We resolved that he must die,&#xD;
and die by powder and fire; but in consequence of tl4&#xD;
fact, that they explosive grains were rather unpopular&#xD;
just then, while both guns and pistols, fire-crackers,&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.           73&#xD;
double-headers, and torpedoes, being strictly prohibited&#xD;
by-the constable round the corner,--we concluded to&#xD;
defer the execution of the malefactor till the ensuing&#xD;
Fourth of July, then a matter of some eight months dis-&#xD;
tant. But at last, it came. Our revenge had slept,&#xD;
but was by no means extinguished. The' ogre dwelt in&#xD;
the same place still. The hour for dire retribution&#xD;
drew fearfully near-and at length arrived. The cob-&#xD;
bler's doom was sealed. Our maleficent congress-.-&#xD;
boys, all under twelve-had resolved that he must die,&#xD;
then or never, so far as we were concerned. Pistols&#xD;
and powder being still as scarce as ever, we assailed&#xD;
the enemy with a large string of ignited Chinese crack-&#xD;
ers, in lieu of guns and bullets-articles de campaign--&#xD;
not procurable, owing to the limited resources of our&#xD;
combined exchequer.&#xD;
We suffered a.defeat--a rout, total and complete-&#xD;
nor did one of us escape what the cobbler calle  a&#xD;
welting,' for our shoulders tingled many an ho  there-&#xD;
after from the application of a strip of' leath , wielded&#xD;
by the stalwart right arm of the vindictive m n. Now&#xD;
it so happened that, nearly opposite the scene of this&#xD;
farce, there stood a tall flag-staff-' Tom Riley's Fifth&#xD;
Ward liberty pole' it was called-and with this pole is&#xD;
associated, not only the moral of my story, but also one&#xD;
of the most singular experiences ever undergone by a&#xD;
human soul, while incarnated in a ta'bernacle.of flesh&#xD;
and blood, nerve and sinew, muscle and matter. After&#xD;
mutually smarting from the application of the cobbler's&#xD;
welt,' we took counsel and refuge beneath the liberty&#xD;
pole aforesaid ; and the last I remember of the affair is,&#xD;

figure, it struck me that the very quintessence of my&#xD;
felicity on earth would be achieved could I have the&#xD;
exquisite joy and unsurpassable pleasure of hanging&#xD;
him to the weathercock on the summit of that flag-staff.&#xD;
This' would be to me--to us, a very heavenly state in-&#xD;
deed. 'And so I hung him, in fancy, to the north cor -&#xD;
ner of the vane, enjoyed his imaginary struggles for a&#xD;
while, and then went home. * * * * * *     Years&#xD;
passed. My childhood's troubles were forgotten, and&#xD;
man's estate had come, with all its griefs, cares and&#xD;
strifes, and, from a student of revenge, I became one of&#xD;
the science of Forgiveness. During one of these latter&#xD;
years I became interested in the question, 'Has man a&#xD;
death-surviving soul, or not?' and to the solution of this&#xD;
great problem I bent the entire force and energy of my&#xD;
mind, not hesitating to make all. sorts of experiments&#xD;
that held out a hope or possibility of ny reaching a defi-&#xD;
nite conclusion in regard to the subject. In pursuance&#xD;
of this grand object I one day made an experiment&#xD;
which, in some respects, was but too successful ; it was&#xD;
not by means of drugs or potions, magnetism or spiritual&#xD;
circles. At the end of one of these experiments I became&#xD;
totally lost to the external world, its surroundings and&#xD;
influences, and found myself in the world of Spirit-in the&#xD;
midst of a vast and boundless Chaos, in which no sound&#xD;
struck upon me save the rattling of the bones of a huge&#xD;
and ghastly skeleton which swayed and swung to and&#xD;
fro in the bleak air from the point of a vane on the top&#xD;
of a vast pole, itself the very spectre of the one on which&#xD;
mentally, I had hung my mortal foe.&#xD;
Attracted irresistibly by the ominous sounds, I turned&#xD;
my gaze toward it, when instantly the horrible, ghastly&#xD;

thing became endowed with life and speech-ventri-&#xD;
loquial power of speech-and it shrieked into my startled&#xD;
ears these terrible, these ominous words : 'Wretch, look&#xD;
upon the work of thy hands! Here didst thou place&#xD;
me in the years now gone, and 'here have I hung and&#xD;
swung ; here must I hang and swing during 'many and&#xD;

finer than the scintillations of yonder star, the point of&#xD;

it watches you-watches you; and, as you see, is the&#xD;
only one in your horizon from zenith to nadir. That&#xD;

'In God's game, what and when ?' I tremblingly in-&#xD;
quired. And from between the chattering, clattering,&#xD;
horrible jaws of that ghastly thing there hissed back&#xD;
this answer : 'Atom by atom, the elements whereof my&#xD;

out of my spectral cheek  ' there myst be some mistake.&#xD;

Much rait and valuable knowledge flowed in while I&#xD;
stood'there,in the center of the magic sphere, gazing on&#xD;
the second vivorama, or living' picture, delineating the&#xD;
results of my influence on others. Many and many a&#xD;
strange scene passed athwart that globe's interior; and&#xD;
I saw not only what the result of my influence had been,&#xD;
but also what would have resulted had my action, in a&#xD;
given instance, been different from what it really was.&#xD;
Thus, I saw that had a cross word been spoken to a&#xD;
child, whom I had endeavored to soothe by kindness,&#xD;
that child would have been led to restrain himself, in-&#xD;
stead of, as happened, taking advantage, and attributing&#xD;
my complaisance to fear or something-akin thereto. I&#xD;
saw, on that mystic scroll, the simulacrea of every per-&#xD;

great Orders, to each of which there are three sub-ar-&#xD;
ders or classes. - I shall. speak of the Orders, not of the&#xD;

them, I had ranked with the highest, I now found, in&#xD;
this place, where the secrets of all hearts are in very&#xD;
deed laid open, really belonged to a far lower plane,&#xD;

Amongst the rest who had gathered there, were seve-&#xD;
ral females, whose trade ws Sin, and who I .supposed&#xD;
came 'there for their horrid purpose. How mistaken&#xD;
was I! At that time it did not strike me that beings so&#xD;
lost could have a pure thought, or in any way be tempted&#xD;
to quit the hot pavements of the city to spend an hour&#xD;
in God's great Temple, amidst its living columns-the&#xD;
stately forest trees-without mischief and wrong-doing&#xD;
in view. - I looked upon them, especially her with the&#xD;
pale thin lips and large drooping eyelids, with utter&#xD;
loathing. And thus I passed them by; years fled ;&#xD;
never again did I think of them-much less that such&#xD;
creatures could have aught of goodness in them, or feel&#xD;
the need of God's sunshine, or of a bath in His pure&#xD;

ocean of fresh air. In life they' were forgotten, bu&#xD;
now, as that mystic diorama moved forward, I saw that&#xD;
very scene in the grove, reproduced in every minute&#xD;
detail. There-sat the courtezans--there walked I past&#xD;
them; and as she of the large blue eye looked up to-&#xD;
ward me, with a mute demand for one sympathetic&#xD;
glance-one kind word-only one kind word-.-I turned&#xD;
heedlessly away ; and in doing so, I now saw that 'a&#xD;
wrong thing had taken place; for had I spoken kindly,&#xD;
they might have been saved from ruin, so far as the&#xD;
world is concerned-utter and complete. Then, when&#xD;
it was, alas ! too late, I saw how very easily I might&#xD;
have melted and won the heart of the woman with the&#xD;
thin pale cheek, and she would have become a minister-&#xD;
ing spirit for good to many and many a lost and de-&#xD;
graded one. I now saw her antecedents--a young girl,&#xD;
a tender, loving daughter--fair, beautiful and sensitive&#xD;
to the last degree' In her home misery reigned--no&#xD;
work for the father, no bread for her little sisters, a&#xD;
sick mother, and the storms of winter howling in the&#xD;
streets, and the cold wind, sleet-laden, searching for&#xD;
nooks and crannies, that it might freeze the little hands&#xD;
and make the pale lips blue.&#xD;
And then father took to drinking, and the pampered&#xD;
servants of the rich lordlings of the great city drove&#xD;
her with the large blue eye from their doors ; and she&#xD;
was hungry, very hungry; and then thefoul fiend,&#xD;
tempted her to accept a handful of silver from-a male !&#xD;
for MEN never do such things-things so infernal, so&#xD;
hideous, so ineffably mean--in exchange for her body I&#xD;
* * * -* And so she sold it-again, and again, and&#xD;
again I Great God ! she was obliged to sell it, or starve&#xD;

in the midst of the granaries of Plenty 1 Starve her-&#xD;
self ? Yes, but not only herself-that were easy-but&#xD;
the mother who bore her, in agony-the father, whose&#xD;
reason had for a time deserted its throne-the little&#xD;
ones, clustering about the scanty fire in the little tin&#xD;
stove ; these, all these, must eat or die! "The Poor-&#xD;
house 1" A poor refuge indeed ! for although they may&#xD;
have been better off therein, would she ? Doubtful!&#xD;
for-well, never mind what ! She sold herself for&#xD;
bread!&#xD;
Presently work came, but the stain was on her. She&#xD;
had run down a declivity, so steep that she could never&#xD;
clamber up again, unless some friendly hand be stretched&#xD;
forth to help her. And such hands are very scarce.&#xD;
And now I saw what good might have been done, in&#xD;
the days gone by, had I "only thought."&#xD;
This scene passed across the walls of my sphere ; and&#xD;
then there came after it a large blank space, and this&#xD;
taught me that it indicated that some where in my life&#xD;
there had been a corresponding omission. " What can&#xD;
it have been ?" Scarce had this query been framed,&#xD;
than there appeared a picture, which need not be de-&#xD;
scribed, but the sum of whose teachings may briefly be&#xD;
stated thus: I had never married-had never been&#xD;
hailed by the dear titles "Wife" and "Mother."  I&#xD;
had therefore failed in the one supreme womanly duty.&#xD;
Nor. can any soul be fully filled with joy who neglects,&#xD;
those great commands of God and Nature. Children are&#xD;
the crowns of Heaven ; nor can any one-man or&#xD;
woman-taste the -serener and the sweeter joys of Be-'&#xD;
ing, who has failed to love ands be loved, wed and be&#xD;
wedded ; for this is' one and the chiefest of means&#xD;
&#xD;
whereby the soul becomes mellowed, and fit for higher&#xD;
-uses in the Soul-home. For these reasons, my joys,&#xD;
though great, were not equal to what they might have&#xD;
been ; and yet, take it all in all, provided the entrance&#xD;
into the upper land is made with-a clear and healthy&#xD;
conscience and a fair record be left behind, no sense of&#xD;
clearness, lightness and joy can equal that which is ex-&#xD;
perienced subsequent to the first awakening after Az-&#xD;
rael's decree has severed the marriage between matter&#xD;
and soul. The Senses! Roses emit sweet odors, grateful&#xD;
to the nostrils ; yet not all the perfumes of the Gulistan&#xD;
is worth one inhalation of the celestial aroma in whichthe&#xD;
spirit of the good.man or woman floats when once fairly&#xD;
over the barriers which separate the worlds. Color!&#xD;
I never knew the music of hues before I passed away-&#xD;
never conceived of the sublime mysteries, nor realized the&#xD;
great glory whose temple is the chalice of a flower.&#xD;
Touch t Ah, what language, what pen; what tongue&#xD;
can describe the deep raptures of a soul, when God's&#xD;
sublime atmosphere first laves the immortal being! The&#xD;
highest, keenest nerve-joy the body can experience must&#xD;
be very, very dull and tame in comparison ; -and so on&#xD;
through the Sense-gamuts of Earth and the hyper ones&#xD;
of Spirit. Yet only the, good enjoy these pleasures.&#xD;
Sin and pollution, whether of thought or over act, de-&#xD;
tract from the senses and susceptibility to pleasure in&#xD;
both worlds alike ; and so absolutely true is this, that&#xD;
sin and folly ought to be shunned by the people, if for&#xD;
no other than the selfish desire of being happy from&#xD;
oneself. It is better to live right, die right, and be&#xD;
right after death, than it is to purchase transient pleas-&#xD;
ures on earth by drawing too largely on the bank of life,&#xD;

After a while there ceased to be any more pictures,&#xD;
and I became aware of the fact that an unseen force was&#xD;
at work on the outside of the globe,, evidently endeavor-&#xD;
ing to break it down, or in some way force a passage&#xD;
through its walls. What this something could be, was&#xD;
a,mystery, just so long as I vehemently desired to know,&#xD;
which of course I, like others under similar circum-&#xD;
stances, did. I could not, while thus endeavoring, ob-&#xD;
tain my desire, and therefore I naturally began to wish&#xD;
that Nellie or the old man would come, because, in&#xD;
spite of my matchless surroundings, I felt quite human&#xD;
in the midst of Spirituality, and the sight even of an-&#xD;
other than myself would have been a solace and "a conso-&#xD;
lation. No sooner had my mind placed itself upon a&#xD;
new object, than I nmade two new and important dis-&#xD;
coveries:  First, that loneliness or solitude is one of&#xD;
the most terrible punishments to which either God or&#xD;
man could ever possibly condemn a sinful human being.&#xD;
God ;pity the lonely man or woman! O, it is very&#xD;
dreadful to be 'compelled to exist alone !-and there are&#xD;
thousands who walk the great world's streets, who move -&#xD;
along in the very midst of a Solitude, as deep, silent&#xD;
and fearful as that which prevails in Zahara's desert&#xD;
wastes, where human footfalls never disturb the awful&#xD;
stillnesb of the hour. There are those who travel up&#xD;
and down the world's highways, upon whose soul no&#xD;
glad sounds ever fall, and who appear to be condemned&#xD;
&#xD;
to loneliness, as if they were thus expiating some awful&#xD;
penalty as an atonement for great and undreamed-of&#xD;
crimes, committed either by themselves in some pre-&#xD;
existent state, or by their ancestors when the very world&#xD;
was young. There are those who, while all about and&#xD;
around them are merry and jocund as the bees on a&#xD;
May day, are themselves as far removed from the pale&#xD;
of human sympathy, and as utterly AtioNE, as if they&#xD;
were shut up in some rock-ribbed cave in'the heart 'of&#xD;
Mont Blanc or the Mountains of the Moon. 0, it is a&#xD;
fearful thing to be shut out from the great Sympathia&#xD;
whose function is to blend in one the chords of all human&#xD;
hearts ! It is a sad fate indeed to be obliged to live&#xD;
amidst the clamor and the clang of Discord, when all&#xD;
other souls are dancing to the glorious sounds of the&#xD;
great Harmonead; yet many such, aye, far too many&#xD;
such there be, who are thus cut off, shut up, barred out.&#xD;
They might have been let in, had the father given the&#xD;
mother a smile, a caress, a blessing, at the proper mo-&#xD;
ment, instead of a frown,.a rudeness and a secret curse,&#xD;
as is, alas!1 too often the case ; and yet nothing is more&#xD;
positively certain than that somebody must, answer to&#xD;
their own souls, their own consciences, for this most fear-&#xD;
ful entailment of misery, loneliness and woe. See!t you&#xD;
der is a womai-a wife-big with a man-child, who will&#xD;
ere long see the light; but she is miserable-is lonely,&#xD;
is perchance pursed .for becoming-a mother; and so&#xD;
she frets, and mopes, and pines-all the while paining&#xD;
to be delivered of her pnisery and child. At length it&#xD;
sees the day, the sun's bright laugh meets no reionsive&#xD;

Brother or sister,-who readest these pages, wouldst&#xD;
thou know one of the grand.secrets underlying the con-&#xD;

because man is a-social being, has a mortal and invin-&#xD;
cible hatred and' repugnance to solitude, feels the need&#xD;
of associates and sympathy, and will have both if possi-&#xD;
ble, even though obliged to seek them in the very midst&#xD;
of hell itself. Didst thou ever observe that the major-&#xD;
ity of spiritual mediums are men and women who are&#xD;
sensitive, lonely, bereft and forsaken?  Well; look&#xD;
around, and thou shalt find it so. -*nd these, failing to&#xD;
find sympathy on earth amidst their fellows, search for&#xD;
it in the awful labyrinths that underlie the tomb; and&#xD;
from the Middle States vast hordes of semi-infernals&#xD;
come trooping at the heart-calls of these wretched ones,&#xD;
who are thus preyed on by vampires from both Eternity&#xD;
and Time.; 'for embodied wonder-mongers sap them dry,&#xD;
and wear them out, while: disembodied demi-devils de-&#xD;
lude them, until the fair Soul-garden either becomes an_&#xD;
arid waste, or teems with thistles, thorns, and all un-&#xD;

is because their human hearts yearn for sympathy, pine&#xD;

ing to discover and obtain where hope has told them&#xD;
snch things were, they seek for it,-at last, in the horrid&#xD;
belly of social damnation. Their motto, 'A short life&#xD;
and a merry is better than a long and lonely one !' tells&#xD;
too truly the story of many a poor girl's heart. My&#xD;
God, my God, have mercy on the lonely ones ! for thou&#xD;
alone knowest that many and many a sin against soci-&#xD;
ety and thee is committed by such  and others, not of&#xD;
settled purpose of ill-doing, but because urged on by&#xD;
sheer despair. Many a crime has been committed from&#xD;
a mental aberration caused by the horrors of loneliness.&#xD;
Human tribunals take but little if any, account of a&#xD;
criminal's antecedents and surroundings. He or she is&#xD;
judged too harshly, in the main ; and thus it will be&#xD;
until mankind learns a deeper lesson of wisdom than&#xD;
yet. presides over its courts and councils. Only God&#xD;
can truly know a heart ; and whilst this fact is so&#xD;
clear, it is better to err on charity's side, if error must&#xD;
enter into the account at all.&#xD;
In prison there is at least a community of punish-&#xD;
ment, and the sense of this goes far to relieve the tedi-&#xD;
um of incarceration; for, bad though it be, many a one&#xD;
has found it preferable to the perpetual and dreadful&#xD;
solitude to which liberty condemned them.&#xD;
Why are there such vast numbers of deserted wives&#xD;
and husbands ?-so many ruined and cheerless hearths&#xD;
and homes ? The answer is: because neither of the&#xD;
heads of the household has even dreamed that the coin-&#xD;
panion had rights which the other was b9und to re=&#xD;
spect; and the greatest of these rights, and t'e one&#xD;
most disregarded, is the right of being loved by that&#xD;

that wherein a woman's or a man's true and generous&#xD;

by those to whom they naturally cling. It is hard to&#xD;
have their human kindness misconstrued, and to have&#xD;
his or her affection crushed by the heedlessness or lack&#xD;
of generosity of those. who ought to leap, and hail it&#xD;
with all true human thankfulness. God knows that&#xD;
there is too little real affection in the world, and it is&#xD;
very hard to have that little forced back upon the full,&#xD;
true heart from which it was sent forth on A mission of&#xD;
goodness. This sort of thing it is that freezes up the&#xD;
spirit, and makes man and woman lonely hermits in the&#xD;
very midst of the teeming hives of human life, society&#xD;

God has said substantially, ".Bear ye one-another's bur-&#xD;

is undergoing all these- pangs from apparent cause.&#xD;
The wave of pain has gone out, and, like the needle to&#xD;
the pole, flies directly to those whose position on the&#xD;
plane of the great sympathetic nerve of the universe fits&#xD;
then.to receive it. Some one else receives it in turn ;&#xD;
but it becomes less intense, degree after degree, until&#xD;
at last only a faint and tiny wave reaches the foot of&#xD;
the throne.&#xD;
"Eloi, Eloi, lamma Sabbacthani!" groaned the dying&#xD;
Ohrist ; and the throes of his agony went pulsing&#xD;
through the universal human heart, till the most ma-&#xD;
j6stic prince of Seraphim quailed with agony. Even&#xD;
so, still, as in the days of yore, is operative the, same&#xD;
great vicarious law.&#xD;
When the suffering, soul turns itself to God, relief&#xD;
comes, but not an instant before. This latter law-for&#xD;
it is one-was well known in ancient times, and amongst&#xD;
the higher classes of the Orient is so still. It and its&#xD;
operation is well set forth by a modern poet of Islam:&#xD;
"'Allah, Allah!' cried the sick man, racked with pain the long night&#xD;
through;&#xD;
Till with prayer his heart grew tender, till his lips.like honey grew.&#xD;
But at morning came the Tempter ; sai4, 'gall louder; child of Fain!&#xD;

,AhI' he cried, I've calledso often ; never hear4 the ' Ioeam!X-"&#xD;
And I thought God will not pity; will nbt tfn oa me his eye&#xD;
Then the grave Elias answered, 'God said Uise, Blip*; go  h# a&#xD;

all times, are the mystic sympathants of those who suf-&#xD;

them from   other causes and sources;- yet that a great&#xD;
deal of mental agony does come from the source stated&#xD;
I became perfectly convinced.&#xD;
The last twenty years, I also saw-by the action of&#xD;
a retrospective faculty of my soul, then discovered and&#xD;
applied for the first time-has been productive of more&#xD;
misery than any period of 4ual length since the world&#xD;

nerves and brains are keener, fuller, quicker in action,&#xD;
and more alive to sensations than in the years prece-&#xD;
dent. The mental and physical culture of the people has&#xD;
been such, that not one civilizee in five thousand en-&#xD;
joys good health in either department of common hu-&#xD;

This general information came to me as I flitted on&#xD;
by the home-sides of those whom I loved, and who, in&#xD;
turn,loved me. Loved me! What a world in a word!I&#xD;
In the preceding pages I stated that: there were two&#xD;
draughts of knowledge which came to slake my death-&#xD;
less :soul-thirst,'while, I waited and wished for Nellie&#xD;
and the old man who went with her. The law of soul&#xD;
is, this: any question, the answer to which can be com-&#xD;
prehended by the asker, may be .propounded to itself in,&#xD;
the absolute certainty of a correct response, provided&#xD;
the knowledge it conveys be adapted to the ends of&#xD;
good and use, to either the neighbor or the self. This&#xD;
is an integral law of the very being, no matter where&#xD;
that being may be located. On earth men are not pure&#xD;
nor properly situated, hence it is far more difficult for&#xD;
them to elicit the required knowledge, than it is for&#xD;
those who are not embodied; yet the law is as opera-,&#xD;
tive on the lowest earth as in the highest heaven. In&#xD;
accordance with the principle] laid down, that which I&#xD;
have faintly set forth came to me; but the second les-&#xD;
son, which seemed to be a sequential suggestion of what&#xD;
I thought was an attack upon the external wall of my&#xD;
inglosing sphere, conveyed wisdom as welk asaknow-&#xD;
ledge, the good of which will be seen by those who&#xD;
carefully analyze it..&#xD;

where the disturbance of the crystalline barbrierwas&#xD;

quite as substantial. Among men the surrounding en.&#xD;

odyle is material, therefore this could not be formedof.&#xD;
that. 'It was not soul-substance, because it was far&#xD;
grosser, and served a greatly inferior purpose It was&#xD;
not spirit, either. Here then was a demand for useful&#xD;
knowledge ; nor was it long ere that demand was full&#xD;
supplied ; for it came to me that :embodied man repre-&#xD;

must essentially differ from the others, and in a scien-&#xD;

not by reason' of continuity or rarefaction, but by dis-&#xD;

must be at least two substances, differing in toto from&#xD;
the three primaries, yet of a nature enabling  hem. to&#xD;

unique, single, atomless, homogeneous, and elastic.&#xD;
This envelope is very etherial, and is called Ethylle ;&#xD;
it ,connects'soul with spirit, and unites all three worlds,&#xD;
body; soul, and spirit together, and constitutes not only&#xD;
the spheres, but the 'Personal Nebulo,', out of which&#xD;
the immortal spark creates its surrounding sphere or&#xD;
world, when disembodied, and whereof it, while in the&#xD;
flesh, erectsIts stately chateaux en espagne--its castles&#xD;
in the air. Here was a new solution of a mystery that&#xD;
had troubled not only myself, but many a philosopher,&#xD;
and a solution, too, in perfect and strict accordance&#xD;
with the, principles of the Great Harmonead; for the&#xD;

Following hard upon the last great discovery, came&#xD;
another, not perhaps so sublime, but quite as useful ; it&#xD;
,was this : Th, mental efprt whose results have just&#xD;
been recorded, had the effect- of uplifting my soul, and&#xD;
firing it with, ambition to such an extent or degree, that,&#xD;
seeing how little I knew, and how vast the fields of the&#xD;
unknown were, I regretted my poor weak hufnan&#xD;
nature, and almost hating it, became impatient of re-&#xD;
straint, because I could not take wing, and, flying to&#xD;
the Grand Centre, merge my being into that of God&#xD;
Himself, and thus become all-knowing, all-being, all-&#xD;

'&#xD;
&#xD;
for almost on the, very -instant that this sacrilegious&#xD;
thought took possession :of my soul, my mind lost its&#xD;
clarity, my vision became dim and misty, my equanimity&#xD;
was lost,.and was succeeded by a state entirely differ-&#xD;
ent-a sort of childliness of feeling. Almost instantly&#xD;
my soul lost sight of the magnificent field just opened&#xD;
to its inspection, and was forced by a power not then&#xD;
understood, to turn completely round, and direct its&#xD;
gaze earthward. Resistance being vain, I did so, and&#xD;
observed directly opposite the point of attack upon the&#xD;
sphireal wall, a window-like opening, through which I&#xD;
looked down the vista of a lane of lightsbounded on&#xD;
either side by an impenetrable amorphous wall. One&#xD;
end of this lane terminated on earth, the other in the&#xD;
Soul-world; and from the peculiar nature of the lesson&#xD;
shortly conveyed, I became aware of two things: first,&#xD;
that neither knowledge nor joy ever flow into the secret&#xD;
chambers of the soul, unless the receptacle vessels there-&#xD;
int are duly prepared to receive them ; for although&#xD;
knowledge may become a thing of memory, yet it can&#xD;
only remain stored up like corn in a granary, and never&#xD;
become of positive value,-or serve' -as soul-food, until&#xD;
that soul itself is in a condition to digest and assimilate&#xD;
it. Secondly, there could no. longer be a doubt but&#xD;
that I was being practically instructed by an invisible'&#xD;
being of masterly wisdom and accomplishments ; and&#xD;
from the nature of the emotions within me, to which&#xD;
this thought gave rise, there was but little if any doubt&#xD;
that this invisible teacher was the mysterious 'Him' to&#xD;
whom Nellie had so mischievously alluded, when she&#xD;
invited-ine to come with her.&#xD;
If a woman ist loved, no matter where she be, no mat-&#xD;

&#xD;
ter by whom, or where the lover may be, she knows it&#xD;
instantly, without being told of it. It comes to her just&#xD;
as naturally as the'vapors sail before the summer breeze.&#xD;
I knew that someboyoved me ; and that although&#xD;
unseen hitherto, that some one' was loved by me. The&#xD;
telegraph of Affectio is swifter and surer than that of&#xD;
electric batteries, and every true woman knows it, no&#xD;
matter whether she be dead or alive.&#xD;
As the sense of this flashed over me, my heart went&#xD;
up to God in such a prayer of gratitude as only they&#xD;
can feel and know, whose deathless yearnings have been&#xD;
fully -satisfied. My soul rejoiced in its new tutelage,&#xD;
and it praised God for this sense of the presence in&#xD;
action, if not in sight, of one who took an interest in&#xD;
clearing my pathway to Wisdom's coast, thus early on&#xD;
my everlasting journey toward the shores of the Infinite&#xD;
Sea.*&#xD;
The further end of the lane of light terminated at a&#xD;
spot where was being enacted a scene of a drama where-&#xD;
in the actors were denizens of three worlds-Earth,&#xD;
Soul-world, and Middle'-State. The lesson taught me&#xD;
was, that very often organization, to a great extent,&#xD;
governs and determines human destiny.&#xD;
Before a vast audience, on a Sabbath night, stood a&#xD;
- lonely man-~one with massive and active brain, but&#xD;
thin, weak and 'puny body-therefore an 'unbalanced&#xD;
character. The woman who seven and twenty years&#xD;
before had given him birth, had imparted her own sen-&#xD;
sitive nature to her child ; while the. man through&#xD;
* A revelation concerning which will appear in the sequel ; and&#xD;
one, too, compared to which, the grandest and most beautiful things&#xD;
contained in the present volume, are comparatively trivial.-Pos.&#xD;
&#xD;
whose agency God had incarnated the lonely one, was&#xD;
of an ambitious, affectionate, but passionate and passional&#xD;
nature. The son thus congenitally biased and -tainted&#xD;
had grown to man's estate, and from various social&#xD;
*    and other causes, he being a sang melee, had suffered to&#xD;
such a degree that his soul was driven in upon itselfto&#xD;
a great extent ; which, while rendering him still more&#xD;
sensitive and morbid, also caused his soul to expand&#xD;
knowledge-ward, become wonderfully intuitive and as-&#xD;
piring, yet bound up by the affectional nature within&#xD;
his own personal or individual sphere. But such souls&#xD;
resist'th's damming up ; hence occasionally the banks&#xD;
overfiwId and he became passional; forgot h'is dig.&#xD;
nity;     led to believe that whoever said love, meant&#xD;
love; 2:  beset with temptation, and yielded, until at&#xD;
last b v art was torn to. pieces, and his enveloping&#xD;
sphere is ame so tender and weak, that it could not&#xD;
with= aa any determined attack thereon ; and thus he,&#xD;
like tho ± ands more whose spheres are thus invalidated&#xD;
and rlvaxed, became very sensitive to influences of all&#xD;
sorts al characters, and a -ready tool and subject for&#xD;
the epiisoitations and experiments of disembodied in-&#xD;
habiLnts of the Middle State. He became a'medium!Z&#xD;
Of course this circumstance and qualification necessarily&#xD;
threw him into the society of those who accept the&#xD;
modern theurgy.&#xD;
In proportion to the self-abandonment and personal&#xD;
abnegation, the degree to which the will is vacated, do&#xD;
such persons become good mediums. The more im-&#xD;
mersed in the theurgic studies and novelties they are,&#xD;
the more they lose themselves, anfd their value ceases&#xD;
to be individual; but only representative. In the last&#xD;

sense they inspire a liking in the minds:of others, but&#xD;
in their former capacity, none so generous as to really&#xD;
love and pity them; for, being perfect automata,.sub-&#xD;
ject to any and all sorts of influences, they become all&#xD;
things by turns, and nothing long; hence they are ac-&#xD;
cuse of inconsistency and everything else, by the very&#xD;
people,- to serve, and amuse, and instruct whom they&#xD;
have vacated themselves, and consented tacitly to be&#xD;
drained of the last drop of inan and womanhood by .&#xD;
harpies and varypires from both sides of the grave.&#xD;
The' man before ine had been guilty of this supreme&#xD;
folly, and, like many a. score of others, had failed to&#xD;
realize'that no man or woman can ever be loved alone&#xD;
as the representative or official, but only as man or wo-&#xD;
man ; nor that the more one merges him or herself in&#xD;
an office, the more one sinks the individual in the re-&#xD;
presentative, the less are their chances of being either&#xD;
loved or respected. This is one of the reasons why&#xD;
mediums are, as a class, unhappy and discontented, al.&#xD;
ways craving love and sympathy for their own sakes,&#xD;
and never getting either. As mediums and speakers,&#xD;
they have friends and admirers by the hundred ; but&#xD;
let their gift be lost, or themselves be demented or&#xD;
driven into some silly act, and, lot the 'friends' drop&#xD;
off like rain from a roof. Of course, there are those&#xD;
who will deny this, but it is true, nevertheless, and will&#xD;
remain so, until'these sensitives learn the lesson of self-&#xD;
conservation, and exchange the passive for the active&#xD;
mediumship-the BLENDING for their automacy.&#xD;
Let it be observed, that every human being is sur -&#xD;
rounded with an atmosphere emanating from theam-&#xD;
selves- and that these enveloping auras are charged&#xD;

by the man oi' woman with all the qualities, good or&#xD;
bad, .pertaining to the individual. Thus, a person's&#xD;
sphere may be full of snakes, (figuratively speaking),&#xD;
asps, spiders, toads, and all manner of foul, vile, and&#xD;
venom-meaning things ;while, at the same time,.the&#xD;
speech and external conduct of these same pOrsonsn ay&#xD;
be of the.blandest kind. Now no sensitive can long&#xD;
associate with such  without the imminent danger of&#xD;
foul contagion.; which, to the extent that it affects them,&#xD;
is INSANITY. Let one of them be in company, pure,&#xD;
good, honest and true, and they will be the same ; let&#xD;
them mingle with Atheists; larmonialists. Infidels, Free&#xD;
Lovers, Catholics, Protestants, Philosophers, Scientists,&#xD;
Christians, no matter whom, and straightway they be-&#xD;
come tinctured with corresponding sentiments and opin-&#xD;
ions. Nor is this all; for people from the transmundane&#xD;
worlds are attracted to persons of corresponding senti-&#xD;
ments, as well as to those who, not so, are yet magnetic&#xD;
sensitives, and most gladly avail themselves of the pres-&#xD;
ence of such, to give forth their opinions on everything&#xD;
in general and nothing in particular. This explains&#xD;
why a certain class of mediums blow hot and cold as&#xD;
the days go by ; for scarce an hour in the week are they&#xD;
properly themselves, but nearly all the time are repre-&#xD;
senting somebody else, either in or out of the body to&#xD;

I.ywas.speaking of spheres which encompass lnd&#xD;
uals. They, as all other things in the great Harmonead,&#xD;
are rhythmical. Men and their spheres, like .musical&#xD;

four sorts are plentiful; the first three'are rather scarce.&#xD;
The last can never approach the value of the first, al-&#xD;
beit they will reach to heights and values infinitely be-&#xD;
yond where they may chance to be at present ; but&#xD;
when they reach the point now occupied by notes one,&#xD;
two,gnd three, these latter will have attained a vastly&#xD;
higher place on the infinite scale. Nor. is this all ; for&#xD;
the lpw of physical gravitation has its correspondent&#xD;
in the psychical realm. A stone let fall from a height&#xD;
reaches the ground at a constantly accelerating rate of&#xD;
speed, which speed is itself determined by the greater&#xD;
or less amountof density and weight contained within&#xD;
a given bulk. Thus a cubic inch of cork will be longer&#xD;
on the journey than a corresponding cube of solid steel.&#xD;
And so with the human soul. A, B, and C, being more&#xD;
unfolded at the .start than E, F, and G, by reason of&#xD;
better antecedents and conditions, will, for all eternity,&#xD;
widen the distance at first separating them. To re-&#xD;
turn, The human notes, (and those of spheres), like&#xD;
their correspondents of the musical staff, and of color,&#xD;
are governed by a law of their own. A perfect human&#xD;
society would be perfectly melodious and harmonic, for&#xD;
the reason that every individual would fill his or her&#xD;
proper sphere, and to which they are constitutionally&#xD;
fitted and adapted. Illustration : The sphere of A is&#xD;
sympathetical, and accordant with and to that of C and&#xD;
E, though not with B and F (the law of thirds and&#xD;
fifths), but these latter will accord with other notes,&#xD;
with which also A can assimilate perfectly, and thus&#xD;
the entire human scale can affinitize, and would, were it&#xD;
not that many uncongenial notes are huddled and jum-&#xD;
bled together in that utter distraction and confusion&#xD;
&#xD;
called Society. The sole cause of all the dissatisfaction&#xD;
and discord in the world is to be found in the fact, that&#xD;
human notes, like musical ones, often occupy wrong&#xD;
places on the leger lines of being ; and all that is need-&#xD;
ed to set them right is not, as many world-savers image&#xD;
ine, a complete destruction of the existing system$ but&#xD;
merely a little judicious transposition, to be.effected by&#xD;
the great transposer, Common Sense.&#xD;
As I gated through the lane of light upon the man&#xD;
before the audience, I saw that he, like others, was a&#xD;
good note, capable of filling an important place in the&#xD;
Harmonead, but he was far from being in the right&#xD;
spot, and -for two reasons; one of which was'a too vio-&#xD;
-lent ambition to know mysteries beyond him, arid to&#xD;
change sinners into saints by eloquent speech ; hence&#xD;
he, like myself a few moments before, became impatient,&#xD;
the result of which was a self-doom to lower planes of&#xD;
thought, act and observation. I found that he was un-&#xD;

whose effect would have been 'Popularity' below, but&#xD;
regrets, deep and bitter, in the Soul-world. Fool was&#xD;
he, or was he not? for refusing to ring the dull changes&#xD;
suited to the edification and advancement of so-called&#xD;
Philosophers and Reformers,' people who hold Jesus&#xD;
up to ridicule, and speak of God as "The chap supposed&#xD;
to dwell beyond the stars !" No! His true place was as&#xD;
the center of a few prayerful souls, and the wielder of&#xD;
the pen for God's sake, instead of being the mouth-piece&#xD;
and oracle of and for those, who next day would not&#xD;
only.forget, but previously curse him for his pains.&#xD;
It came tQ me that such is the fate of nearly all that&#xD;
class of persons who cultivate spiritual acquaintances at&#xD;
the cost of loss of will and complete self-sacrifice.&#xD;
These people, at best, are only the ephemera of the age,&#xD;
and well'it is that such is the case. They are sneered&#xD;
at, vilified, scandalized, and traduced-sapped of the&#xD;
last drop-of vitality, and then exultingly laughed at for&#xD;
being such fools ; and when the days of hardship come,&#xD;
but very few of those for whom the tremendous sacrifice&#xD;
has been made, will go to their relief. In fact these&#xD;
human-looking and humape-talking people can stand the^e&#xD;
self-immolated victim's grief and sorrow very well in-&#xD;
deed. The rising tide may engulph the lonely ones,&#xD;
and not a hand of them all be stretched out to save.&#xD;
True, such conduct is in strict accordance-with the way&#xD;
of the world, bit it is a'very bad way, and those who&#xD;
follow it will pay for their folly in the coming ages.&#xD;
Instead of using these unfortunates in .this manner,&#xD;
tie true 'motto and resolve of every one should be:&#xD;
It may be that God or Destiny is working out some&#xD;
deep and . instructive problem through that man or&#xD;

woman, for the world's bestgood. It is well to be on&#xD;
the safe side, and therefore best to treat them tenderly&#xD;
and kindly ; for it may happen that it shall be said to&#xD;
us hereafter :'Even as ye have treated the least of&#xD;
these, my servants, ye have also treated me!' It wll&#xD;
be pleasant to know, in the upper worlds, that you have&#xD;
dried, some tears and bound up some bleeding wounds&#xD;
in the lower ones."&#xD;
Thus I stood and viewed, at one-glance, both cause&#xD;
and re sult. The man's body was haggard, his spirit&#xD;
very, very weary, and the enveloping sphere was liter-&#xD;
ally torn into shreds. These spheres can only be kept&#xD;
intact and entire by the exercise of an active will ; but&#xD;
this man's will, like that of.vast numbers of the medi-&#xD;
umistic class-the automata of the dwellers in the Mid-&#xD;
dle State-had slept, and that so soundly that nothing&#xD;
but the echoes of his own misery could break it. Such&#xD;
people let things take ,their own course, or else rely on&#xD;
Spirits and.earthly friends, instead of on themselves and&#xD;
Deity. They pursue the ways of such a false life, heed-.&#xD;
less of the inevitable consequences of sorrow and dis-&#xD;
aster that must ensue ; they forget that, to be even a&#xD;
moderately talented man or woman, is infinitely prefer-&#xD;
able to being the mere machine and mouth-piece of the&#xD;
loftiest seraph in the great Valhalla of the Skies-and&#xD;
that, too, for reasons plainly discernible.&#xD;
I saw, with grief and consternation, that not one&#xD;
medium in every ten had a perfect envelope-else they&#xD;
would not be so easily influenced by mortals, nor ob-&#xD;
sessed and possessed by the dead people from the'id-&#xD;
regions beyond the earth.&#xD;

diums may he and are attacked,* the remnant of will&#xD;
destroyed or lulled, the mpral sense stupified, and the&#xD;
entire being subjugated by spectral harpies and human.&#xD;
ghouls, who wander. on either, bank of existence.&#xD;
Many people, when reading the Scriptures, are in-&#xD;
clined to explain away many things as. 'poetry' which&#xD;
ought not to be so interpreted. Thus'the first chapter&#xD;
of the book of Job contains: the following assertions,&#xD;
which it would be well to read oftener and more care-&#xD;
fully: "Now there was a day when the sons of God&#xD;
came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan&#xD;
came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan,&#xD;
Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord&#xD;
and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from&#xD;
walking up and down in it."&#xD;
Satan here undoubtedly means an evil chief of the&#xD;
harpy bands infesting the borders of both worlds,&#xD;
whose sole delight it is to circumvent God and man,&#xD;
and bring all good things to an evil end.. Whether&#xD;
this state of things shall continue, depends not upon&#xD;
God or the devils, but upon man, and his actions, influ-&#xD;
ence and aspirations. Those ill-meaning ones who live&#xD;
just beyond the threshold, often attain their ends by&#xD;
subtly infusing .a semi-sense of volitional power into&#xD;
the minds of their intended victims ; so that at last&#xD;
they come to believe themselves to be self-acting, when&#xD;
* Good spirits do not break the sphere ! They approach the crown of the,&#xD;
head and infuse thoughts, else blend themselves with the subject, but&#xD;
never by destroying either consciousness or will. Evil spirits attack&#xD;
the fwer brain, the amative organs, the lower passions, and force the&#xD;
spheres of their victims. In a similar way the bad people destroy and&#xD;
ruin good ones.-PUB.&#xD;
&#xD;
in fact they are but the merest shuttlecocks, bandied&#xD;
about between the battledoors of knavish devils on one&#xD;
side, and devilish knaves upon the other ; and between&#xD;
the two, the poor wretches are nearly heart-reft and&#xD;
destroyed.&#xD;
For every ill there is a remedy, God-sanctioned and&#xD;
provided ; and the only one in such cases is the re-&#xD;
integration and rejuvenation of the will, and the repair-&#xD;
ing therewith of the disrupted sphere. The way that&#xD;
end is accomplished, is through the instrumentality of&#xD;
prayer and a persistent exercise of will. No person,&#xD;
who is at all reasonable, will for one moment believe&#xD;
that any of the profounder9mysteries have yet been&#xD;
revealed by the class of spiritual beings who rap, tip,&#xD;
turn tables, and entrance mediums3-the effect of all of&#xD;
which should only be to merely call attention, in well-&#xD;
regulated minds, to a new class of demonstrative evi-&#xD;
dence of the soul's immortality. When the intercourse&#xD;
between the two worlds shall have become normal,&#xD;
healthful and regular, the earth's inhabitants may look&#xD;
for light from beyond, of a nature and character far,&#xD;
very far above aught that yet had come ; and that much&#xD;
of the coming light will reach the earth in the same&#xD;
mode as that which is herein given, must be apparent,&#xD;
because the process is a normal and healthful one, pro-&#xD;
ducing satisfaction and content instead of doubt and&#xD;
distrust, as has been the case heretofore&#xD;
Mankind, in either world, are as yet only on the bor-&#xD;
ders-the very Adges of being and of knowledge--and&#xD;
men-must and will come en rapport with the higher life&#xD;
only by living correct lives below.&#xD;

lightenment -consists in- gaining a complete mastery of&#xD;
the self, the purpose, and the will. The man or woman,&#xD;
who believes what any spiritual being may rap, tip, talk&#xD;
out, or write about, merely because it is a Spirit, has&#xD;
not yet left off childish things. Tin the coming time,&#xD;
men will derive information directly from the Soul-&#xD;
worlds, and not by the proxy of tables and spirits, as&#xD;
now.&#xD;
The course here recommended is the true and only&#xD;
one capable of effecting the redemption and liberation&#xD;
of the obsessed from the terrible thraldom to which, by&#xD;
their own unwise action, they have been subjected.&#xD;
The sufferings of the class alluded to ought to be prima&#xD;
facie evidence to themselves that their methods of&#xD;
dealing with the dead are not the proper ones, nor such&#xD;
as should be adopted by any sane or rational being.,&#xD;
Their miseries, as a general thing, aresevere enough to&#xD;
excite the pity and'commiseration of even a fiend ; yet&#xD;
scarce ten in a hundred of these self-immolated victims&#xD;
receive even the poor meed of thanks, much less food&#xD;
and raiment, for- their toil and pains. By self-abnega-&#xD;
tion and resignation of the will, they have brought their&#xD;
misery upon themselves, by opening their spheres for the&#xD;
free entrance of whatever apocryphal philosopher or&#xD;
saint, whose identity they can NEVER prove, may choose&#xD;
to accept their invitation ; and after displacing their o-wn&#xD;
common sense, substitute a very un-common kind in lieu&#xD;
thereof. It is only by an assertion of self, of will-a&#xD;
persistent upbuilding and reparation of the shattered&#xD;
fabric of their personal spheres--that the evil can be&#xD;
kept distant and the good be attracted and entertained.&#xD;

are from the Middle Kingdoms; some of them are very&#xD;
powerful, and are scripturally spoken of as "Princes&#xD;
and Powers of the Kingdoms of the air." The better&#xD;
class are denizens of the pure Soul-worlds, which is as far&#xD;
removed from the Mid-region as light is from shadow.&#xD;
It is only by beating them off, that mediums can ever&#xD;
hope to regain their self-control, establish a communion&#xD;
with the divine City of pure souls, and successfully pass&#xD;
through the body of their double death, into the calm,&#xD;
sweet and holy atmosphere of the blissful regions which&#xD;
exist above.&#xD;
Millions there are, around whose hearts the tendrils&#xD;
of fondest love do clinig-whose happiness is centered&#xD;
in some dear one's heart, and to whom life were a dreary&#xD;
waste and barren, were they deprived of the sweet and&#xD;
cheering presence of their lost ones, at least in memory.&#xD;
The question of questions to these is, 'Shall we .meet&#xD;
again ?-shall the broken links be reunited in the lands&#xD;
beyond the River? When Death shall have sealed us&#xD;
apart, comes there ever a time when that seal shall be&#xD;
melted, nd- we loving ones clasp each other in a fond&#xD;
embrace ?' Such are vital questions, to which different&#xD;
answers must be given.&#xD;
One of the' secrets which I soon discovered in the&#xD;
Soul-world was that consanguinity, although a very&#xD;
strong bond of union between people, is by no means&#xD;
the strongest. Those souls are nearest who occupy the&#xD;
same position on the plane of development. Thus it&#xD;
often happens that brothers and sisters are really less&#xD;
related than the same persons are to the most distant&#xD;
strangers. Children are often born of the same-pa-&#xD;
rents, whose appearance, conversation, deportment, con-&#xD;

stitution, habits, disposition and proclivities are as dif-&#xD;
ferent as different can be. Such relations have nothing&#xD;
in common, save that the monad idonstituting the soul of&#xD;
each becomes incarnate in the same matrix ; that is all.&#xD;
All monads vary; some are more unfolded and unfold-&#xD;
able than others, and while the'intrinsic quality of each&#xD;
corresponds, yet conditions may cause a higher expres-&#xD;
sion of one than another, or that same one under differ-&#xD;
ent circumstances. Thus a monad, be it never so ripe&#xD;
in itself, isforced to surround itself with certain spirit-&#xD;
ual and'material envelopes, furnished by the father, on&#xD;
its passage from his soul-cells to the gestative chamber&#xD;
wherein it clothes itself with corporality. -Now, what-&#xD;
ever clings to the monad on, its passage is'totally ex-&#xD;
ternal, and is charged with the man. If he is a sot or&#xD;
libertine, bloodthirsty or ambitious, cheerful or de-&#xD;
spondent, these states are impressed upon all his juices&#xD;
and fluids, nervous, physical gr spiritual; and the en-&#xD;
velopes of the commissioned monad, partaking of these&#xD;
impressions, subsequently develops in the same direc-&#xD;
tion, and, on the principles of attraction and impres-&#xD;
sion, affect the fore-future of the contained monad or&#xD;
germ-soul. That this is true, and that all the ill is im-&#xD;
pressed externally, is proved by the fact that a couple&#xD;
may have children during one decade, wherein the pa-&#xD;
rents live upon a low external plane; which children&#xD;
will be angular, and manifest anj but .lovely and,&#xD;
genial traits. The same persons, during the second&#xD;
decade, may reform and become deeply moved with re-&#xD;
ligious sentiment, such as expresses itself in prayer-&#xD;
meetings, singing, and violent faith-practice. The chil-&#xD;
dren born under this reign will be deeply excitable,&#xD;

fervent, ambitious, sensitive, boisterous at times, and, as&#xD;
a general thing, superficial and changeable. During&#xD;
the third decade, when common sense, practical ration-&#xD;
ality, and just ai d noble views of life and its obligations .&#xD;
shall have taken the place of their previous state-&#xD;
when cleanliness, light, fair, and sunshine, daily-acted&#xD;
prayers instead of loud-mouthed lip-worship,, consti-&#xD;
tute some of the elements of their religion-and when&#xD;
their bodies have become purified by proper living,&#xD;
eating, drinking and labor--their children will be born&#xD;
with larger brains, better bodies, nobler appearances;&#xD;
and their career through life will correspond. All this&#xD;
is as true as. the Eternal Gospel, and shows that, al-&#xD;
though ill and evil are dee ly rooted in the human soil,&#xD;
yet they are by no means ineradicable.&#xD;
All men know that they often feel more love and&#xD;
friendship for strangers than they do. for their own&#xD;
blood brothers; ind friendship, when real, and not&#xD;
based upon. physical properties, or selfish motives, is a&#xD;
thing that unquestionably survives the ordeal of the&#xD;
grave. Persons thus bound together will, and do meet,&#xD;
'whether of the same lineage or not. But it often happens&#xD;
that thebest of earthly friends belong to and represent two&#xD;
distinct orders of soul ; and it may be that they pertain&#xD;
to orders so widely separated, that on earth, as in the&#xD;
heavens, they must lose each other, and strike hands&#xD;
and hearts over a 'gulf impassable by either. Do you&#xD;
not see hundreds of proofs of this all around you on the&#xD;
earth? A tender, gentle, delicate girl often clings, with&#xD;
all the desperate energy of idolization, to some rough,&#xD;
coarse, uncouth, unkempt and brutish fellow. The love&#xD;
of that.podr heart will redeem that man from- many a&#xD;

horror in the Middle state, and ensure his speedier en-&#xD;
trance into the lovely gardens of the Soul-world ! The&#xD;
same principle is demonstrated even among the animals,&#xD;
between opposite species of whom the fondest attach-&#xD;
ments often exist, as is seen in the Happy Families of&#xD;
menageries ; the 'love of a lion for a tigress, a cat for&#xD;
a rat, a horse for a hog, a serpent for a rabbit, and last&#xD;
and greatest, the love of the dog for man-an affection&#xD;
so deep and.pure, that it puts that between human be-&#xD;
ings to the blush of shame by comparison ; for the dog--&#xD;
generous, noble dog !-everywhere sacrifices every other&#xD;
love, and devotes his entire being to the services of his&#xD;
human friend.&#xD;
Dogs and birds abound in both the Spirit and the&#xD;
Soul-worlds. In both they are representatives of states&#xD;
--loves, affections-and are found in the former realm&#xD;
quite as often as.in the latter, for the-reason that the&#xD;
coarsest, most wicked, and brutal mian, he who most&#xD;
violently hates his kind, yet must, and does, and will&#xD;
love something, and the dog is almost universally that&#xD;
object, else a bird or fowl ; for how often do you see&#xD;
the drunkard followed by his faithful cur, and how fre-&#xD;
quently the hardest, man in a community lavishes the&#xD;
most tender care upon a fowJ.-a game-cock, a parrot or&#xD;
canary-sweet, beautiful, lovely canary!&#xD;
The first reply to the question,'Shall we friends meet&#xD;
again?' must be answered affirmatively. You will meet,&#xD;
but whether ye remain together is another question,&#xD;
and depends altogether on the rapidity with which the&#xD;
one shall unfold and develope up to the point occupied&#xD;
by the other. But, if the one friend belongs to one or-&#xD;
der, and 'the other to a higher, then the electric chain&#xD;
&#xD;
of unity will connect ye over the vastest ocean of infi-&#xD;
nite space. Everything moves in elliptical orbits in the&#xD;
material, spiritual and affectional realms alike.: In the&#xD;
Soul-world the foci of this ellipse are Memory and Hope.&#xD;
The lines constituting it are also the lines of the great&#xD;
llarmonead-the vast Sympathia; every human being,&#xD;
good as well as evil, is located on its plane, and along&#xD;
its wires forever is flashing love and well-wishing, and&#xD;
every heart must have its pulses quickened by the warm&#xD;
magnetic outflow. The sun's heat falls at an angle&#xD;
which enables Nova Zembla's icebergs to laugh at his&#xD;
efforts to melt them ; they have laughed these myriad&#xD;
centuries ; will laugh, perhaps, for hundreds more ; yet&#xD;
the sun is patient, still shines on, and with such a steady&#xD;
radiance and blandness, that the frozen North begins to&#xD;
quake with apprehension lest its reign be forever closed;&#xD;
for somehow it begins to feel that the question of its&#xD;
regnancy is only ofie of time, and that heat is, after all,&#xD;
more powerful than cold, love than hatred ; wherefore&#xD;
it must one day yield-resolve its ices into liquid flow ;&#xD;
cause its frozen heaps to ride upon the waves toward&#xD;
the steaming seas ; relieve the poles ; let the earth&#xD;
swing round, and all surface-earth smile with green&#xD;
gladness. So with the. worlds beyond. The rays-of&#xD;
goodness have long shone upon the evil ones of the&#xD;
Middle State, and have bounded off again. Still around&#xD;
go the flashes again and again; for neither God nor true&#xD;
human souls grove tired of loving, even though that love&#xD;
be repelled seven, seventy, or seven myriads of times !&#xD;
Around goes the flash, and at every circuit some good is&#xD;
done!. Navigators tell you that every year the number&#xD;

in number in the Southern seas., -Every one of them is&#xD;
a victory achieved by Persuasion over Force ; and even&#xD;
so the population of the realms of the Soul-worlds is eon-&#xD;
stantly increased by the accession of people who, having&#xD;
got tired of Hell, voted it unpleasant, and have deemed&#xD;
it expedient to emigrate to Heaven, a land which, they&#xD;
have learned from missionaries, abounds in milk and&#xD;
honey, and all good things whatsoever. Every one of this&#xD;
host of emigrants is an accession to the Good, and a loss&#xD;
irreparable to the Bad ! Every one is a symbol of the&#xD;
victory of Right over Wrong. Bye-and-bye there will&#xD;
be a 'total depopulation of the Middle kingdoms, and&#xD;
their places will be supplied with something better ;&#xD;
and the sooner mankind cease to do evil and learn to&#xD;
do well, the quicker will this much-desired hegira take&#xD;
place.&#xD;
Pure love changes males into men; and when men be-&#xD;
come what they are capable of in an upward direction,&#xD;
the Middle State will cease to be replenished by such as&#xD;
love ill.&#xD;
Of course, in a work professedly dealing with and ex-&#xD;
plaining the principal, like this, it is impossible to enter&#xD;
fully into specialities; that task is deferred till another&#xD;
occasion.&#xD;
No truer saying ever was uttered than that God helps&#xD;
those who help themselves ;-a work which every one,&#xD;
especiallythe mediumistic class, are especially called on&#xD;
to perform.&#xD;
There being two 'sides to everything, there is the,&#xD;
same to mediumaship. The non-injurious kind is that&#xD;
which I advocate, and it consists in the Blending pro.&#xD;

&#xD;
harm can result from it. Oii the contrary, the popular&#xD;
sort, originating in the orient long centuries ago, and&#xD;
now revived in these latter days, can but be injurious&#xD;
to the last degree, because it consists in the usurpation&#xD;
of the living by the UNKNOWN ! There is a better&#xD;
way--a safer road, a thornless route-by means of&#xD;
which to reach all the knowledge, and far more besides,&#xD;
which is sought to be obtained by the other practice.&#xD;
That surer means does not consist in an abandonment&#xD;
of self, or stultification of the moral sense and will, nor&#xD;
in Mesmerism, or .the use of hashish-the pestilent&#xD;
thing-nor in the employment of any unhealthful&#xD;
means, but in an increase and strengthening of will,&#xD;
and consciousness, and moral purpose; not in a loss&#xD;
of consciousness or responsibility, but in an intensifica-&#xD;
tion and growth thereof. This better sort of spiritual-&#xD;
ism is based upon the heart and soul; not, like the other&#xD;
sort, upon the nerves and body. This better sort pro-&#xD;
tects the sphere from the attacks, amatory and cerebral,&#xD;
to which the acolytes of the other kind are subjected.&#xD;
If people went direct to God for enlightenment, instead&#xD;
of to Spirits, who so frequently deceive, there would be&#xD;
much less, in fact no.evil at' all, resulting from the in-&#xD;
tercours-e over the bridges of Time and Eternity ;, and,&#xD;
by firmly relying on Him whose very existence thou-&#xD;
sands of the inhabitants of the Middle State deny and&#xD;
seput the bare idea of, people would not only be able to&#xD;
preserve their odylic spheres intact, but would be pro-&#xD;

men and women yet, by a great- deal. No one is, who&#xD;
yields the will and resigns both soul and body to any&#xD;
spectral experimenter in phreno-mesmerism who may&#xD;
chance to flit along, in their excursions 'up and down&#xD;
the world,' and who are continually 'going to and fro&#xD;
therein.' Reasonable people, whether of earth or higher&#xD;
worlds, are beginning to weary of seeing and hearing&#xD;
sensible-looking -men and women, with closed eyes,&#xD;
pacing up and down a platform, and, with folly-driven&#xD;
tongue, giving vent to 'philosophy' which neither God,&#xD;
angels nor men can comprehend a word of !&#xD;
Before long, something of the realities of the soul and&#xD;
its hidden history will be known, and then ambitious&#xD;
mouthers will no longer split the ears of the people&#xD;
with senseless harangues-olla-podridas compounded of&#xD;
moon-shine and nonsense-pseudo-philosophic hash, con-&#xD;
cocted of fish, flesh and fowl-most foul, gammon of&#xD;
Bacon and Swedenborg essences-whereof the great&#xD;
Seer is as innocent as Peter the Hermit was of slaying&#xD;
Abel. The time approaches .when a better state of&#xD;
things shall exist, and more rational views of human&#xD;
immortality bientertained by the masses. People have&#xD;
made a great mistake in supposing that all the high-&#xD;
flown stuff spoken, written or printed, as emanations&#xD;
from the worlds beyond, were really true ; for much of&#xD;
it originated in the brains of the deliverers thereof,&#xD;
whilst more of it is but the result of tricky exploita-&#xD;
tions of disembodied wags, or downright evil spirits.&#xD;
Another and very popular error is, that the advent of&#xD;
Spiritualism constitutes the opening dawn of a New&#xD;
Dispensation ; that it is to supersede Christianity, or to&#xD;
become the nucleoli of a new order of sects, or even the&#xD;

nucleus or pivot of a single one. No, no ; Spiritualism&#xD;
has not yet produced fruit in the souls of its believers,&#xD;
at all to be compared -to those growing on the tree&#xD;
planted on the stony heights of Calvary nearly~ two&#xD;
thousand: years ago ! It is, in itself, powerless to su-&#xD;
persede a system so infinitely grand and sublime- as that&#xD;
founded by the twelve fishermen and their illustrious&#xD;
Lord. Nor is such its mission. Supply and demand wait&#xD;
ever upon each other. The sense of human immortality,&#xD;
in community, the wide world over, had grown dull,&#xD;
vagueand indistinct, lulled by the droning music and&#xD;
somnifying humdrum of ,theology. Churchianity to a&#xD;
great degree. had usurped the office and functions of&#xD;
Christianity, and the sense of an hereafter had so&#xD;
nearly died .out, that bad advocates of, annihilation&#xD;
preached and printed their infernal libels on the cor-&#xD;
ners of the world's highway, and millions began to seri-&#xD;
ously question wherein man was entitled to what ani-&#xD;
inals were not ; while philosophic hucksters still, with&#xD;
quirk and grimace, howled forth "Books-proving God a&#xD;
myth, Christ a bastard, the Bible a lie, immortality a&#xD;
lame delusion, and virtue mere nonsense 1" And then&#xD;
- these peddlers bawled : "What pre-eminence hath a&#xD;
man, above a brute ?. Wherein is, he better than the&#xD;
dogs which perish ? Who knoweth the Spirit of a man&#xD;
that it goeth upward, or the. spirit of abeast that it is&#xD;
blotted out and goeth outward like an extinguished&#xD;
. lamp, or. downward like a lead to the bottom of-non-&#xD;
entity?  Come, buy my books.! come, buy my books I"&#xD;
Surely here was a demand for. light upon the tre-&#xD;
mendous. question, 'Are we to be, or not to be, when&#xD;
life's fitful fever is o'e'r?' Here, was a question requir-&#xD;

ing the lips of the infinite God to answer-and He did I&#xD;
for with the weakest instruments He confounded earth's&#xD;
greatest and wisest men. Through a harlot's daughter&#xD;
was met and vanquished all opposers of His truth, that&#xD;
"Death was not the destiny of man;' through a bar-&#xD;
ber's clerk was revealed the Hierarchy of the vast&#xD;
Heaven; through a country-school teacher was declared&#xD;
the Order and the Majesty of Being; and through the&#xD;
agency even of the wicked dead was demonstrated&#xD;
man's continued life ! Spiritualism came, not as the su-&#xD;
perseder of the Christ, but as the final demonstrator of&#xD;
His truth. It came to transjise new energy into man.&#xD;
and man's-religion ; it comes to point the better way,&#xD;
and to foreshadow the radiant glories now beneath the&#xD;
horizon; it comes saying, 'Prepare ye the way of the&#xD;
Lord-make His paths straight by straightening thine&#xD;
own 1' It comes to infuse new and glowing hope in&#xD;
every heart bowed down ; and from the hill-tops and&#xD;
the valleys of the world alike, it points man's vision&#xD;
upward, and bids him, in the midst of all his trouble&#xD;
and sorrow, to 'Remember, God is there,! up there !&#xD;

ness-a sun too, whose glorious beams will dissipate.&#xD;
all the fogs and mists now bending over human heads,&#xD;
and shutting out the light of higher heavens than op-&#xD;

There can be no doubt but that the days of Evil by&#xD;
God are numbered-those arising from    obsession in-&#xD;

Gazing still adown the lane of light, I- saw that a&#xD;
process had been commenced in the soul of 'the man&#xD;
upon the stage, who was about to .address the assem-&#xD;

him free-for already his sphere indicated the begin-&#xD;

as he helped himself, and shook off the influence of&#xD;
others, just so far did one or two attendant and ra-&#xD;
diantly bright beings, of a high and pure order, assist&#xD;
and protect him"; and, gazing upon the scroll of his des-&#xD;

complete his apprenticeship, and stand before the world&#xD;
no longer an automaton, but a firm and- solid-minded&#xD;
man ; that, no longe lecturing upon useless metaphysi-&#xD;

great practical drama was seen, and its beautiful teach-&#xD;
ings conveyed to me, closed up, and once more I stood&#xD;
solitary in the midst of my aural sphere. Looking now&#xD;
toward the point wherefrom I had turned a little while&#xD;
before, my eyes observed that the -apparent attack upon&#xD;
its integrity was still going on ; but this was mechanical&#xD;
only, for my mind was dwelling upon things of far more&#xD;
interest and importance. Amongst other lessons gained&#xD;
during the brief time that I had been dead to earth,&#xD;
alive to a higher existence, wts this : The terrestrial&#xD;
world itself is really spiritual, could mankind but per-&#xD;
ceive it. For instance; every tree, shrub, flower, plant&#xD;
and animal is not only possessed of an ideal and thought-&#xD;
representative -value, but they are themselves essen-&#xD;
tially spiritual ; for the bark, and leaves,.and woody&#xD;
fiber, the flower-petals, and all that physical eyes be-&#xD;
hold, are not the things they seem, but are merely the&#xD;
outer-coats and coverings, the cloaks and garments which&#xD;
the things themselves put on; the nature of the external&#xD;
form being determined by alaw integral to the very thing&#xD;
itself, just as a. picture is merely the physical embodi-&#xD;
ment of an idea in the artist's mind. Unfavorable con-&#xD;
ditions cramp some trees physically; but burn the wood, i&#xD;
and the spirit of the tree is as perfect as the Infinite&#xD;
One could fashion it. So also with human trees. tn-&#xD;
teriorly, many men and women are better than they&#xD;
seem, and many are worse. Still, be it remembered,&#xD;
that beauty andsymmetry is natural to trees, even though&#xD;
storms, and snow, and fierce winds dismember and ren-.&#xD;
der them hideous ; so also virtue and goodness is natu-&#xD;
ral to the human soul, while vice and deformity are&#xD;

artificial and conditional acquisitions. A-man may lose&#xD;
an eye, leg, arm, be disfigured by accident or disease&#xD;
to an extent that will render him hideous to all em-&#xD;
bodied beholders; but let him die, or, while living, be&#xD;
gazed at by spiritual beings, and his legs, arms, eyes-&#xD;
the whole man stands revealed in all his true propor-&#xD;
tions.* This discovery gave me joy, indeed; for I had&#xD;
known some whose disfigurements had pained me ex-&#xD;
ceedingly. No maimed forms ascend from gory fields&#xD;
of battle ; no crippled people inhabit the Soul-worlds.&#xD;
Thank God for that ! True, in the regions midway,&#xD;
there are many who, being insane, or immersed in phan-&#xD;
tasies, insist on appearing as they were on earth, or&#xD;
even in worse plight; but this is not necessarily so, any&#xD;
more than the grimaces of a clown or mountebank are&#xD;
the natural expressions of his features. By this time I&#xD;
had also learned that, with the exception stated pre-&#xD;
viously. in reference to the essences of things, the two&#xD;
worlds-earthly and spiritual-were in scarce any one&#xD;
thing alike, as had been taught by those whole books&#xD;
upon the subject I had lost so much valuable time in&#xD;
reading--finely written and eloquent books, truly.---&#xD;
yetrafter all, I found them now to be filled with':&#xD;
1       "Rich windows that exclude the light&#xD;
And passages that lead to--nothing."&#xD;
My, experience demonstrated that the two worlds are&#xD;
not equgl, contimjous, or even resemblaut.  In fact,&#xD;
they, being .disparates, many failures must necessarily&#xD;
be made in attempting,-in the present state of the lan-&#xD;

tions of things above to' those below-not with the col-&#xD;
loquial and literary, nor even with the aid of modern&#xD;
philosophical, scientific, metaphysical nor theological&#xD;
tecinics now in use amongst thinkers. But the people&#xD;
are longing for information respecting the soul's condi-&#xD;
tion subsequent to its departure from the rudimental&#xD;
scene ; they want to know what a soul is, where it goes,&#xD;
how it gets there, and what are its environments thereaf-&#xD;
ter ; consequently the essay to impart the required in-&#xD;
formation must be made, even at the risk of adding to&#xD;
the hundred failures already made. The word VAST, for&#xD;
instance, when I -apply it in the description about to be&#xD;
given, is not to be understood in the sense of enormoud-&#xD;
ness, but in a different one altogether. Well then, in&#xD;
a short time, the side of the sphere yielded to the ap-&#xD;
plied force, and broke completely in two from top to bot-&#xD;
tom, and the two sides instantly thereafter resolved them-&#xD;
selves into a vast. archway-vast in beauty, grandeur,&#xD;
color, form and symbolic meaning. Toward the invit-&#xD;
ing passage thus presented, as if impelled by an invisi-&#xD;
ble, but powerful force, I slowly moved involuntarily.&#xD;
Upon reaching it, the entire sphere seemed to draw&#xD;
into me. I stepped over the threshold ; turned to look&#xD;
at it-but, lo1 it had vanished.&#xD;
This taught me a lesson. I saw that if one chose to&#xD;
do so, he migh;, while on earth, and in the Middle State,&#xD;
draw his sphere within him, and lie concealed in the&#xD;
deeps of his own being, unreadable by any, save God&#xD;
and the dwellers of the Soul-world. This is effected at&#xD;
first by strong efforts of the will,-(both Napoleons are&#xD;
illustrative instances),-which soon becoming a habit,&#xD;
is effected by the soul mechanically. At first, upon find-&#xD;

was effected. No opportunity,'however, was then af-&#xD;
forded for investigations of the mystery, for a crowd of&#xD;
new marvels rolled on me, in such quick succession,&#xD;
that all my soul became at once deeply engaged. 'y&#xD;
vision was clear, distinct. and far-reaching, and thou.&#xD;

scene was the realization of the fairest, brightest Ar-&#xD;

hundreds of the most beautiful of human creatures that&#xD;
imagination ever pictured were there, in all the glory&#xD;
of aflte in Heaven. Not a line of care or sorrow traced&#xD;
its course upon a single cheek or brow of the vast mul-&#xD;
titudes who. thronged the glades and gardens'of that&#xD;
wondrous realm. It was the actuality of the fairest&#xD;
ideal of earth's noblest poet, and something more ; for&#xD;
there was a nameless something about it that earth can&#xD;
never give. Magnificent and lofty trees, the movement&#xD;
of whose very leaves was sweetest music ; streams of&#xD;
living water, whose ripples flashed back ten thousand'&#xD;
magic'hues of loveliness, to a stately but unmoving Sun&#xD;
in the mid-heaven ; flowers of rare conformation, whose.&#xD;
colors and fragrance put earthly roses to the blush, un-&#xD;
folded their glory-cups to God's bright sentinel, and&#xD;
praised His name in incense-offerings; bowers of shrubs,&#xD;

Even animals were there-some of familiar and well-&#xD;
known forms, some of new and singular shape and pe-&#xD;
ouliar grace. Birds-rare-birds, of the most brilliant&#xD;
plumage, played amidst the trees, and warbled songs of&#xD;
strange melody and meaning. Such, and a thousand&#xD;
other things beside, not one of which I had ever ima-&#xD;
gined to exist, were constituents of the scene upon which&#xD;
my eye now rested for the first time, Taken as a&#xD;
whole, the entire vivorama was; in its nature and ef-&#xD;
fect, at that time, incomprehensible, and at first some-&#xD;
what oppressive ; but this latter feeling was very ephem-&#xD;
,eral, and gave place to a delight, at once pure, deep&#xD;
and unalloyed.&#xD;
When thisscene first birst upon me, my attitude was&#xD;
one of unmingled surprise, and I retained it all the while&#xD;
my soul was drinking in the glory. Casting my eyes&#xD;
groundward, the vision rested upon an opake, cloud-like&#xD;
soil ; and while inwardly wondering whether the soil&#xD;
was really what it seemed to be, or not, I heard my&#xD;
name called in well-remembered tones. Turning has-&#xD;
tily, I found the sounds came from a grove hard by,&#xD;
whence three persons were seen approaching me. They&#xD;
drew nearer, and I had no difficulty in recognizing one&#xD;
of the comers to be Nellie. I knew her by her general&#xD;
air, not from the appearance of her person; for that was&#xD;
entirely change, and no longer appearing a mere child,&#xD;
she looked to have reached the happy medium state&#xD;
wherein the girl just begins to be the woman. She was&#xD;
very pretty when she had assumed the status of a child,&#xD;
but now she fairly blazed with a beauty most transcend-&#xD;
ent. By her side moved a young and noble-looking&#xD;
man, yet one around whom there floated an atmosphere'&#xD;
&#xD;
4.&#xD;
&#xD;
of Power, Will, and Intenseness, that inspired me at first&#xD;
with something very akin to awe.&#xD;
His garb was decidedly oriental, and became his fea&#xD;
tures wonderfully, while at the same time it imparte&amp;amp;a.&#xD;
freedom and grace, that added to, instead of detracting&#xD;
from his dignity. Observing that I scrutinized his ap-&#xD;
parel, he smiled, and glanced sidewise at my own. I&#xD;
did the same, and it flashed upon me instantly that my-&#xD;
self, instead of being habited after the fashion of the&#xD;
Occident, I to others must present the appearance of a&#xD;
sultana of the ancient East. Again my eye met his,&#xD;
and in that meeting there was a mingling too, for I felt&#xD;
and knew that he was mine, and I his own ; that we&#xD;
two were henceforward to be as one-for a period at&#xD;
least, if not forever. Poor me-I did not then know&#xD;
how long' forever' is. On earth, in love affairs, the&#xD;
term means two months, more or less. It stands for a&#xD;
longer period here, yet does not include the categories&#xD;
of all the eternities-quite. - I had forgotten that states&#xD;
constitute the marks of duration in the Soul-worlds, and&#xD;
not the tickings of a clock ; but so inveterate is the&#xD;
force of habit and ideal associations, that at first'it was&#xD;
almost impossible to predicate sequences-upon anything&#xD;
else than lapse of time, or to dissociate the memories of&#xD;
the past, and the menstruum of the events whereof they&#xD;
are the shadowy records, from thy reaties of the then pre-&#xD;
sent, and the action of the New Pigipia operative in the&#xD;
Soul-world. Besides this, I had bienetheretofore deeply&#xD;
tinctured with the folly-essence, so mueh of which has&#xD;
been distilled by modern eolists, and wouldbe philoso-&#xD;

of others believed that the doctrine of 'eternal affinities'&#xD;
was true ; and that every one would somewhere meet&#xD;
with a congenial partner, in whose society all the com-&#xD;
ing cycles of Time would be joyously passed. I have&#xD;
outgrown that folly long since. The doctrine is a false&#xD;
one for -this brief reason. God alone is infinite. No&#xD;
human being is infinite, save in capacity for acquire-&#xD;
ment ; therefore the human soul must be fed by that&#xD;
alone which is superior in its nature, at every stage of&#xD;
its growth, progress or unfoldment ; for. which reason&#xD;
no one soul can forever supply the demands of another.&#xD;
No two souls develop in equal or parallel lines, or at&#xD;
the same rate, for which reason one must outgrow its&#xD;
affinities for another ; besides which marriage in the&#xD;
Soul-world is an entirely different institution, as to its&#xD;
nature condition, purpose, result and effect, to what it&#xD;
is on earth. Lust and passion, selfish interests, and ten&#xD;
thousand other things pertain to marriage on the earth,&#xD;
which enter. not at all into that of the loftier stages of&#xD;
human existence. On earth, at best, love and affection&#xD;
are plebeian. In the Soul-worlds they are imperial!&#xD;
In the former these things go begging-in the latter,&#xD;
never. On earth the person loving often embalms the&#xD;
loved one in his or her own sphere, and then clings to&#xD;
the worthless thing thus infiltrated, thus loving the self&#xD;
and not another. Being therefore all on one side, there&#xD;
is no mutuality. Such is not the case in the Sunny&#xD;
Land!&#xD;
The glowing son of the Orient drew near to me, and&#xD;
I to him.. Our spheres touched ; they blended-and in&#xD;
an instant I knew more-of what love and tenderness&#xD;
really meant, than- in all the long years I had lived&#xD;
before.&#xD;
&#xD;
vt&#xD;
&#xD;
When first gazing on my reflected image in the flodr-&#xD;
mirror, I had suspected the nature and fervor of the&#xD;
regal passion; but now, as he touched me--as our&#xD;
spheres blended, and strange thrills went bounding and&#xD;
dancing through every avenue of my being, I realized&#xD;
that not one half of the reality had ever been imagined,&#xD;
even in a remote degree.&#xD;
Among people of the higher orders in human society,&#xD;
the testimony of the 'hear-says' is not regarded as being&#xD;
of the most satisfactory or convincing kind. This book&#xD;
and those which are to follow it, is, and will be, ad-&#xD;
dressed only to those who think and feel for themselves;&#xD;
are intended for those who can pierce through tie mere&#xD;
formalism of narrative and statement, to the solid' prin-&#xD;
ciples underlying them. And for this reason, therefore,&#xD;
have I forborne to repeat many strange and wonderful&#xD;
things told ine by him who now stood at my right side&#xD;
notwithstanding that such repetitions would be deeply&#xD;
interesting to those people who believe they have im-&#xD;
mortal souls, but are not quite certain of that fact. It&#xD;
is better to tell what I saw, felt, learned and experi-&#xD;
enced, than to relate what others told' me.&#xD;
I may remark, en passant, that the sentence ' stood&#xD;
bymy side' appeared to be well founded; for although&#xD;
I knew my comrades to be spirits, yet they were to me&#xD;
.quite as really and palpably human; as was the mother&#xD;
at whose dear breast I drew in life many a long year&#xD;
ago.&#xD;
Mention has been made of the fact that' knowledge&#xD;
comes to a person in the higher life, just in proportion&#xD;
to that person's fitness for its reception, the Use in&#xD;

and therefore the doors of the soul's knowledge-cham-&#xD;
bers were swung wide upon their hinges, so to speak,&#xD;
and into them the following answers flowed naturally&#xD;
and sweetly, in response to self-propounded questions&#xD;
concerning all that had transpired since my emerge-&#xD;
neent from the interior of my personal into the general&#xD;
sphere of that portion of the immense Soul-world where-&#xD;
in I now found myself. It has already beenstated, and&#xD;
understood by the reader, that the sphere in which the&#xD;
memoramie tableaux moved across its diameter, was the&#xD;
personal out-surrounding of the individual. Precisely&#xD;
the same, with the exception of being on a vastly gran-&#xD;
der scale, was this new Soul-realm whereof I had be-&#xD;
come an inhabitant. The fact is, I had been in it from&#xD;
the dawn of the second hour of my disembodiment, only&#xD;
that the opacity of my vision and the walls of my sphere&#xD;
had prevented me from realizing it, just as a person with&#xD;
nebulous eyes is unaware of the glories of a landscape&#xD;
in the midst of which he stands, alongside of a friend&#xD;
whose eyes are clear and good, and whose soul fairly&#xD;
dances with rapture as he scans the sea of' loveliness,&#xD;
which is all shut out from. the other.&#xD;
Ali truths go in couples. I had just discovered one,&#xD;
and its mate very soon thereafter appeared. It was this:&#xD;
-What I had thought to be an attempt to break down&#xD;
the walls of my circumvallated sphere, prove now not ,f&#xD;
to have been the- work of another, but was the result of&#xD;
the operation of a natural law of the soul-that of IN-&#xD;
TROMISSION; but which law does not act until after cer-&#xD;
tain others have -effected peculiar changes in the indi-&#xD;

purporting to come from 'Royal Circles' in the Soul-&#xD;
world, through scores of modern eolists. My design is&#xD;
to show the rightly dying what they must expect when&#xD;
rightly dead. True, there is an increasing number of&#xD;
Spiritualists and others who accept the revelations of&#xD;
mediums oi the principle interdum stultus bene, loqui-&#xD;
tur; yet there are others who accept nine-tenths of&#xD;
what purports to-come from the worlds beyond, merely&#xD;
because of its claim. Truth will bear its own weight;&#xD;
if not now, then in the course of coming time ; still it&#xD;
is ever and always best for every one to reason well on&#xD;
every proposition or statement offered as coming from&#xD;
the world of spirits-this book's contents, of course, in-&#xD;
chded. Amongst other notions, which along with my&#xD;
co-believers on earth I had imbibed, was that which&#xD;
declares the Spirit-land to be a fixed revolving zone-&#xD;
a sort of second edition of the earth and its adjuncts.&#xD;
I had expected to find my last home on one of those&#xD;
aerial belts, occupying space just as a town or city does.&#xD;
What an error ! No two antipodal things can be more&#xD;

jection from the countless hosts of beatified and radi-&#xD;
ant souls who dwell together and create their own&#xD;
scenery and surrounding, just as a man creates chateaux&#xD;
en espagne, only that in this latter he exists forever on&#xD;
the outside-in the former, dwells within them. In&#xD;
other words, the realm whereof I was an inhabitant&#xD;
was not physical in any sense, nor were any of its sub-_&#xD;
jects or objects ; neither were - they, phantasmal, but&#xD;
were spiritual, in the.sublijne sense of that much abused&#xD;
term ; and although not permanant or fixed, as. is a&#xD;
town on earth, yet were none the less true and real.&#xD;
In order to better comprehend what sort of a place*&#xD;
is that world wherein I met Nellie and mine, it will be&#xD;
well if the reader remember that everything save&#xD;
thought is perishable. For instance you have a thought&#xD;
of a pink satin dress, made up in a peculiar style ; your&#xD;
father has a thought of, a new cottage, complete in all&#xD;
its parts ; your brother invents a' neW-modelled car-&#xD;
riage for your mother's use ; while your farmer invents&#xD;
a new building, which will serve at once for carriage-&#xD;
house and barn-and all four of you forthwith proceed&#xD;
to realize your several ideals ; and in a month the new&#xD;
barn stands upon the brookside, the new cottage-peeps&#xD;
forth from its bower of elns, the new carriage rolls&#xD;
along; and in it, clad in your pink satin, you enjoy a&#xD;
ride with the dear old mother. Three days thereafter&#xD;
ttIe cottage and barn catch fire, and the dress and car-&#xD;
riage become ashes, and so do all your patterns and&#xD;
models ; yet your thoughts are living, still fresh as&#xD;
ever, and all that is necessary, is for all four of you to&#xD;
once more embody them in material garb, and in an-&#xD;
other month P stranger, having seen the first and not&#xD;

knowing of the catastrophe, would swear that whatnow&#xD;
he beheld was the same formerly so much admired-&#xD;
and he would be right. The ideas arethe same, albeit&#xD;
the material raiment is not. John Doe is still John&#xD;
Doe, whether in rags or riches ; why not, then, John's&#xD;
thought be the same ?&#xD;
It will be well to remember that GOD IS A' THINKE--&#xD;
that the vast material universe is the visible result ohn&#xD;
single effort of a single faculty-organ of the Deific brain,&#xD;
and-tremendous thought !-that faculty-organ will yet&#xD;
make myriads of new movements, each one followed by&#xD;
results still more stupendous and magnificent than the&#xD;
vast array of starry suns which now light up the Halls&#xD;
of Silence and of Space! Again: the spiritual or rathe1-&#xD;
the thinking part of man is all there is of permanency&#xD;
about the human being. His body is the sport of Death,&#xD;
and his aid-je-canip Disease ! but his soul can never be&#xD;
touched by the former, nor forever be harmed by the lat-&#xD;
ter! for soul is not to be pernanently injured by any&#xD;
power subservient t: the infinite God. All there is of&#xD;
man is his thought-power ; the THINK is himself. By&#xD;
this we know him; and he who gives forth most of him-&#xD;
self, if he be bad, does the most injury to the species and&#xD;
the world. If he be good, such an one lives longest inn&#xD;
mei's hearts, on historic page, and in the traditions of&#xD;
the race.&#xD;
The Spiritual Universe ! What a mighty eoncep-&#xD;
tion ! And yet, even that, grand as it is-for all 'the&#xD;
material globes of space, chained together, are, after&#xD;
all, but a mere little'island floating, like a bottle, upon&#xD;
the crest of a single wavelet of the Infinite Seal!-yet,&#xD;
even that Spiritual Universe itself, with its amaz-&#xD;

each of which latter is composed of the blended spheres&#xD;
of innumerable millions of separate dualities-even all&#xD;
this-all these, I say, are but the result of a single effort&#xD;
of another distinct faculty-organ of the GREAT BRAIN;&#xD;
yet even this grand result will be surpassed by every&#xD;
one of the myriad efforts thatsame faculty-organ is des-&#xD;
tined to put forth. And when it shall have moved more&#xD;
times than there are stars in the sky, grains of 'sand&#xD;
upon the sea-shores, leaves in the forests, or aspirations&#xD;
in the, human soul-greater than all-the end will not&#xD;
be even foreshadowed, nor God's laboratory one whit&#xD;
exhausted! Man himself, generically speaking, wher-&#xD;
ever localized beneath the bending dome of the imperial&#xD;
Heaven, is but the result of another single effort-of&#xD;
another single organ of faculty. For although man is&#xD;
nidulated in' and developed to personal'11istinctness&#xD;
through matter, yet the very nature- of the thinking&#xD;
principle at once forbids the assumption that it sprung&#xD;
from any combination of material essences, howsoever&#xD;
subtle they may be, and at once explodes the spiritual-&#xD;
istic doctrine that matter continues on into spirit. No;&#xD;
soul is discreted from matter by a -gulf so wide that an&#xD;
infinite vaccuum exists between the coarsest -soul and&#xD;
the most sublimated etherial vapor that ever resulted,&#xD;
or ever will result, from molecular attrition or chemical&#xD;
resolution. Individual monads-all men and women-&#xD;
are scintillas or parts, of this third great thought of the&#xD;
Mighty Thinker, God ; they are corruscations from The&#xD;
Over-Soul, while Matter is constituted of etherial ema-&#xD;

ence represents a thought of Deity; so also man thinks&#xD;
himself in his actions, .and fills the world with his&#xD;
thoughts, variously clothed,; some in iron, steel, wood,&#xD;
paper, ivory, cloth, palaces, engines, ships, houses, parks,&#xD;
gardens, and so on ; so, also, after his disembodiment,&#xD;
will he surround himself with soal-created forms, whose&#xD;
aspect, shape and texture depends altogether on the&#xD;
cleanliness and purity'of the loom wherein these mental&#xD;
fabrics are, woven. The sole difference between the&#xD;
creations of the mortal and post-mortem artificer is,&#xD;
that, instead of arraying them in gross or coarse ma-&#xD;
terial, as on earth, he in the Soul-worlds, fashions the&#xD;
garments of such stuff as thoughts themselves are made&#xD;
of; or, to give it still clearer, each thought possesses an&#xD;
inherent vitality of its own, as also form, proportion,&#xD;
and coherence. Thus, if an engineer thinks a. locomo-&#xD;
tive, all he has to do. in order to impress his thought&#xD;
on others, is- to give it a suit of iron, brass and steel to&#xD;
wear, and, lo! all the world hails, and triumphantly ac-&#xD;
knowledges the worth of the offspring of his deathless&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
Just as soon. as the man has placed metallic parts&#xD;

people can visit each other there as well as anywhere&#xD;
else. But visitors may not be'equa1s for all that. In&#xD;
each society will be found those who love and affect&#xD;
birds ; and just as sure as he or she has a bird in the&#xD;
soul, just so sure will that bird be born thereof, and be-&#xD;
come, to all intents and purposes (except begetting its&#xD;
kind) a veritable bird. Others love trees, rivers, castles,&#xD;
brooks, hills, dales, vales, vineyards, gardens, groves,&#xD;
cottages, palaces, mountains, animals, and so on, through&#xD;
an interminable list, and interminable combinations of&#xD;
what that list may contain.&#xD;
Whatever be the ideal of a man or community, just&#xD;
so will be the out-sphering thereof. Thus, Mohammed&#xD;
(and the' Orientals generally) loved woman, for the&#xD;
sake of the :sense-gratifications she- was found capable&#xD;
of imparting. Accordingly, when his soul was trans-&#xD;
figured, it went directly to that section of the Soul-&#xD;
world where were congregated those like unto him-&#xD;
self; and, when he came back, he fired his partizans&#xD;
with the deepest and wildest enthusiasm ever known&#xD;
on earth, by telling them that the women of Paradise&#xD;
were fairer than the full moon, more lovelythan the&#xD;
dawn, and that every mother's son of the faithful should&#xD;
be rewarded there, for all their earthly sorrows, by the&#xD;
absolute possession of the moderate number of seventy&#xD;
thousand houris.&#xD;
Mohamied was not a liar nor an impostor; he told what&#xD;
he believed to be truth. His houris, like the birds and&#xD;
beasts just spoken of, were out-creations of -the sensual-&#xD;
istic mind of the sphere into which 1e rode on the sad-&#xD;

As this and similar light flowed into myasoul, that&#xD;

exhibitions of his loving kindness and careful provi-&#xD;

before quite mysterious, and, amongst others, why Net-&#xD;
lie and Mine had at first shown themselves to me under&#xD;
the guise of Youth and Age. It was to all the quicker win&#xD;
my esteem and confidence, each of which are prime ele-&#xD;
ments both of friendship and love. Previous to my&#xD;
change, I had often tried to analyze this last-named sen-&#xD;
timent or passion (as you will), as it exists amongst the&#xD;
people of the world. The result of that analysis was,&#xD;
'Love is a mixed passion ; its orbit is elliptical-friend-&#xD;
ship is at one of the foci, and lust at the other.'. Now,&#xD;
however, as my enraptured vision swept the plains of&#xD;

mained the same in the Middle States-nor merely spiritu-&#xD;
al kingdom. With penetrating glance I swept the fields&#xD;
of earth, and the result was a complete conviction ht&#xD;
ninety-five one-hundredths of that which goes by love'&#xD;
tender, gentle name, was a compound of three constitu-&#xD;
ents-Parentalism, Amative desire, and the softer ele-&#xD;
ment, Friendship. Hence sex, and what comes of it on&#xD;
earth, is at best but the most coarse and external ex-&#xD;
pression of a great soul-law, which can only -fully de-&#xD;
monstrate itself in those who are in no one respect abnor-&#xD;
mal or diseased. Sex really means more than people&#xD;
even remot1y suspect. In the Soul-world it does not&#xD;
serve the same purposes as on earth. There, sex is of&#xD;
mind-on earth it is of the body mainly. I had sup-&#xD;
posed it to be a-fixed physical principle ; and so it is,&#xD;
but itgis also something more-for in the higher. realms&#xD;
of human being, where everything expresses itself as it&#xD;
really is, and passes at its true value, it is found that&#xD;
many who, as if by accident, had worn the physical&#xD;
characteristics of one, were.really, at soul, of the oppo-&#xD;
site sex. For instance, Male means Energy, Wisdom,&#xD;
Knowledge, Power, Creation, UsE-Female is the syno-&#xD;
nym of Music, Beauty, Love, Purity, Harmony, Goon.&#xD;
Now let two such meet in the Soul-world, and if they&#xD;
are adapted to each other, their, spheres-nay, their&#xD;
very lives-blend together ; the result of which is mu-&#xD;
tual improvement, purification,.gratification, enjoyment,&#xD;
and happiness--which state of bliss continues until new&#xD;
unfoldings from within shall unfit them for the further&#xD;
continuance of the union ; whereupon there is a mutual&#xD;
Soul-region, of which Love is the key ; and then the world will see&#xD;

separation-not because they love each other less, but&#xD;
some other one the more ; and that other one, be its&#xD;
'male or female, is certain to be ready for the reception&#xD;
of the new love. There is no jar, no ill-feeling, no dise&#xD;
cord about it. Some of these unions may last for what&#xD;
to man may seem to be long ages, but what the final&#xD;
result will be I have not space here to mention:&#xD;
It often happens that human bodies are so diseased,&#xD;
and by mal-practice so distorted from their true uses,&#xD;
that pure and genuine love cannot express itself--.&#xD;
wherefore it soon becomes a sealed mystery, and Pas-&#xD;
sion usurps Love's holy throne. He or she whose nerves&#xD;
have become ruined, either by grief or excess, opium,&#xD;
rum, tobacco, Mesmerism,-,Oppression, .Neglect, and&#xD;
things of that. order, can never taste the ineffable joys&#xD;
of love that attend on those who in such regard are&#xD;
healthy.&#xD;
Love has beonneither -a boyish or girlish sentiment,&#xD;
else a sort. of spasmodic fever, which possession speedily&#xD;
and forever chills.&#xD;
In human society it has become a purchasable com-&#xD;
modity. Women sell themselves for gew-gaws-for a&#xD;
home-to escape parental tyranny and unjust espionage.&#xD;
Men buy them, and think they are gaining love-not&#xD;
realizing that joys or pleasures bought at any price are&#xD;
not the realities for which the bargain was made, but&#xD;
only counterfeits, which all too soon demonstrate theit-&#xD;
own worthlessness. Buy a woman ! purchase a man !&#xD;
bargain for. love! How much is Sunshine worth a&#xD;
quart ? How does Goodness sell by the barrel? It is&#xD;
very easy for either man or woman to buy each other's&#xD;
garments, but the souls beneath them must be won by&#xD;
wooing. Physical possession never yet satisfied a soul,&#xD;

and never will.  Soul naturally shrinks from  scales,&#xD;
weights, measures,, and yard-tapes ; and it quite as in-&#xD;
tensely despises all protestation. Why? Because pure&#xD;
love is undemonstrative. Demonstration proceeds from&#xD;
volition, but love flows from a fountain altogether back&#xD;
of will. People may be proud of their property, but the&#xD;
human can have no true deep joys, save such as spring&#xD;
from love, pure, strong, earnest, spontaneous and recip-&#xD;
rocal. Whatever is not thus based is distasteful to the&#xD;
soul in. its higher moods. Joys of a tumultuous charac-&#xD;
ter, such as spring from impulsiveness and passion, are&#xD;
both short-lived and exhaustive ; and the pestilent brood&#xD;
of anger, jealousy, hatred, disgust and trouble, ever and&#xD;
always foflow in their train-priests of Misery, prime&#xD;
ministers ef Evil ! On the other hand, pure manly,&#xD;
womanly,-human love, is recuperative, re-creative-is a&#xD;
virtue-exhilarant, tonic of good,' vice-dispellant, and&#xD;
health-promotive ; while contentmeggf heart,-peace of&#xD;
mind, security, trust, calmness and lerenity, are its at-&#xD;
tendant ministers. God, who made us, well knows that&#xD;
there is more of good than evil in our hearts, by virtue&#xD;
of our ancestry-Nature and Himself ; yet, for His own&#xD;
grandly-purposed end, He permits us all to wade to&#xD;
Heaven through the malarious swamps of hell I-permits&#xD;
us all to experiment and suffer, in order .that we mfay&#xD;
grow powerful and strong, and thus be fitted for the&#xD;
tremendous destiny that awaits all who wear the human&#xD;
form on the thither side of Time. People feel before&#xD;
they think, and the act of one single impulsive moment&#xD;
not seldom enshrouds an entire life in gloom. Have&#xD;
mercy, therefore-always ! Mere thinking without.feel-&#xD;
ing is quite as bad-nay, worse ; for it freezes up the&#xD;

gladdened by the presence and growth of one green&#xD;
thing upon its crystal sides-not even moss. So with&#xD;
soul ! It is bad to sin from impulse, but far worse to&#xD;
do wrong from settled purpose. There are two classes&#xD;
of persons who err. Those who do so from no evil in-&#xD;
tent at heart, soon vastate their load, and become resi-&#xD;
dents of the Soul-world ; those who sin from the head,&#xD;
pass into the Middle State and become the infesting de-&#xD;
mons of modern spiritual mediums:&#xD;
The deepest wrongs of human existence are those&#xD;
against the inward soul and sense of right. Illustra-&#xD;
tion : Whatsoever earthly 'couple shall a ume the&#xD;
dreadful responsibility, not only of imbitt . g each&#xD;

cordant bodies, inevitably fashion a hell-sphere for&#xD;
themselves in' the  ddle State, whence they shall not&#xD;
go forth until th termost farthing is paid. The re-&#xD;
cent partial uplifting of the veil separating earth from&#xD;
regions beyond, has had the effect of removing the&#xD;
sense of accountability from the minds of a great many&#xD;
people, who, having conversed with the dead through&#xD;
raps and tips, and hearing no valid accounts of a burn-&#xD;
ing lake of literal fire and brimstone, straightway fall&#xD;

and self-inflicted torture, the laugh would not be quite&#xD;
so loud and long, nor the finger-snapping near so fre-&#xD;

bauchery, and all vileness, sulliciently dreadful to appal&#xD;
the stoutest heart of any sane one who dwells in the&#xD;
same awful phantasies, insanities and evils. Around&#xD;
the heads of those who wandered up and down its noi-&#xD;
some lanes and alleyways, were wreaths of twining,&#xD;
writhing serpents, instead of crowns and coronets of&#xD;
light. There were many who believed in literal hells&#xD;
of fire, and such were surrounded by spheres of flame,&#xD;
and therein must burn and suffer so long as the fearful&#xD;
phantasy shall last, and till they be' redeemed by self-&#xD;
effort. Drunkards, libertines, gamblers-all evil things&#xD;
and persons were there, along with atheists and other&#xD;
intellectual sinners. - On an eminence in the midst of&#xD;
the deepest and most fearful hell, I saw the exact image&#xD;
of one of earth's so-called great philosophers ; and it&#xD;
was given me to know that the man there represented&#xD;
was doomed, when his life on earth shall be ended, to&#xD;
expiate his terrible offences against God, nature, reli-&#xD;
gion, and his own conscience, and his fellow-men, by&#xD;
sufferings too terrible to be adequately described.&#xD;
"Men know the right, and well approve it too ;  ,&#xD;
They know the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue."&#xD;
So with the philosopher. The man knew better than&#xD;
he taught ; and when he. dies, unless he shall repent,&#xD;
his doom is a hell whose terrors are indeed fearful; nor&#xD;
will he be able to emerge thence, before the cries of his&#xD;
scores of thousands of deluded victims, some of4 whom&#xD;
have been driven to vice, crime, insanity and suicide by&#xD;
his execrable teachings, shall be changed into appeals&#xD;
to God in his behalf.&#xD;

for one's bad and baleful influence while on earth; and&#xD;
the more extensive this has been, the morefearful ;the&#xD;
penalty self-inflicted therefor. The man who has taught&#xD;
millions that God is a revengeful being; that He;ever&#xD;
stands ready to hurl ruin and destruction on the wp14;&#xD;
to rain.literal fire and brimstone on the earth, and this&#xD;
frighten people into woe and insanity, must -abide the&#xD;
consequences, and in the world beyond be compelled to&#xD;
face the dreadful music himself may have evoked. And&#xD;
so with others, let their influence be what itmay. Eter-&#xD;
nal justice rules the destiny of mankind ; and sooner or&#xD;
later its behests must and will be accomplished.&#xD;
I turned in affright from the horrible scene, but not&#xD;
without reaping a mental treasure fom what I had&#xD;
beheld, both of the Soul-world and the Middle-state. It&#xD;
will be remembered that I had asked certain questions,&#xD;
which were not responded to. These questions, and&#xD;
others had been uppermost in my mind all along, and&#xD;
now as our faces were once again turned toward the&#xD;
bright scenes of the Soul-world, I realized that neither&#xD;
it nor its fearful antipodes were absolute fixtures or&#xD;
fixities. The human soul is kaleidescopic. The scenes&#xD;
it forever conjures up before it from out its mighty deeps,&#xD;
and by which it is surrounded, are constantly and for-&#xD;
ever changing, no matter whether its locality be on&#xD;
earth, in the mid-region of the great world's atmosphere,&#xD;
on the confines of the two great states, embodied Or&#xD;
free ; or whether it be a dweller in the city of divine&#xD;
souls, the law is the .same and incessantly operative.&#xD;
Change is written on all things ; and although in' es-&#xD;
sence soul can never alter, yet its moods and phases&#xD;
constantly do, else Hell would be a permaneiity, Earth&#xD;
stand still, and Heaven itself grow monotonous. In&#xD;

accordance with this principle, therefore, no scene in&#xD;
-   the Soul-world is a permanency, but as soon as one has&#xD;
produced all the joy it can to those from whom it is an&#xD;
outgrowth or projection, it changes, but ever toward&#xD;
the higher and more resplendent.&#xD;
One question there was, of great weight and import-&#xD;
ance,,which I asked of my soul, and to which a response&#xD;
aftpr a time flowed in. It was this.: Do spiritual beings&#xD;
live eternally as distinct entities, or are they after a&#xD;
time absorbed into Deity, as the higher .Brahmins and&#xD;
other orientalists maintain?  The reply to this was:&#xD;
Reasoning from what any human being knows, no matter&#xD;
how lofty he niay be in intellect, the decision arrived at&#xD;
must be conjectural at best ; for whether we are to be&#xD;
forever, can only be known to Him who taketh no one&#xD;
into his counsels. But reasoning from what we already&#xD;
know concerning the nature of soul, mind, thought, and&#xD;
capacity, the inference is plain that no absolute absorp-&#xD;
tion will ever take place, but that the double-unit man&#xD;
will forever preserve his distinct and marked person-&#xD;
ality.&#xD;
Are idiots immortal ? Answer-All that is born of&#xD;
human parents, all beings who took their external forms&#xD;
through the agency. and channels of the male brain,&#xD;
nerves, prostate and testes, and the female matrix, are-&#xD;
necessarily immortal.&#xD;
Question-But animals have been impregnated by&#xD;
male brutes of the human species, and human females&#xD;
have borne offspring to brutes-if human medical testi-&#xD;
mony,,and the confessions of parties implicated are to&#xD;
be credited; but whether such cases have or have not&#xD;

parents being undoubtedly' human, be immortal?  An-&#xD;
swer-As monsters, no I Idiots, both of whose parents&#xD;
are human, are essentially immortal. idiotcy isbut&#xD;
another name for weakness; and a monad havingOiCO.&#xD;
put forth its powers sufficient to build ;itself a full i-&#xD;
man body,no matter how imperfect, must necessarily' put&#xD;
forth more of its inherent energies, if not in one world&#xD;
or sphere, then in another, in the nurseries of the Soul-&#xD;
world; and as it grows strong it gradually approadlies&#xD;
the, point of self-ness-the Ego will be attained. It is&#xD;
only a question of tiie and condition. Not so with&#xD;
semi-brutes.&#xD;
Question-But women have conceived from human&#xD;
union, yet owing to some accident or fright, have brought&#xD;
forth monsters. Are these immortal?  Answer-No.&#xD;
thing that is not human is immortal, in the sense of&#xD;
self-poisedness. and self-presence. If these monsters&#xD;
are cerebrally human, and their malformation be merely&#xD;
limb-distortion, taen that thing is destined to super-&#xD;
mundane existence.&#xD;
Quesbion--But human bodies, though brainless ones,&#xD;
have been born of women ?--Well, they are not immor-&#xD;
tal. Violent chemical actions en utero has destroyed&#xD;
the conditions of successful monad-gestation, while per-&#xD;
petuating the vegetative fcetc2 life: Of course the&#xD;
thing is soulless.&#xD;
Question-But the monad had begun to put forth its&#xD;
energies. What then has become of it ; is it fore r&#xD;
blotted out of being ? Answe--There stands a human&#xD;
female, but the body you see is not herself: The soul is&#xD;
her, not the flesh it wears. The monsters heated of in&#xD;
medical works are but the product of body-iot of souL&#xD;

pass from the spiritual atmosphere interflowing the&#xD;
material or oxygenic one, into the nosti and brains.&#xD;
and soul of a male, thence through the parts and pro-&#xD;
cesses already mentioned. Now the human form born&#xD;
brainless is of the nature of an abortion ; and the ques-&#xD;
tion arises, are abortions immortal ?  The answer is:&#xD;
A  human germ, when first planted at the gestative&#xD;
center, undergoes a variety of rapid and extraordinary&#xD;
changes, assuming successively the typal forms of all,&#xD;
the lesser orders of animated nature, from the jelly-fish&#xD;
to the perfectly human. In some women these pro-&#xD;
cesses are pushed with- extraordinary vigor and speed,&#xD;
so that at the end of a very short period the fetus pos-&#xD;
sesses all the requisites for permanency except physical&#xD;
vigor. If then abortion takes -place, the nursling is&#xD;
provided for and grows to comparative perfection, in&#xD;
the Soul-worlds of course. Such beings constitute a&#xD;
distinct and separate order of souls, and are, by the&#xD;
great soul law, condemned to come to earth, and by&#xD;
association and affiliation with embodied persons,&#xD;
through magnetic rapport, experience the pleasures and&#xD;
pains of self-development. These spirits will be treat-&#xD;
ed of hereafter, when I come to write concerning" THE&#xD;
REALM OF THE FAY."&#xD;
But to- our subject.' If abortion take place before&#xD;
the monad has, in the womb, put forth its powers to a&#xD;
degree wherein the human characteristics rise above all&#xD;
the lower forms, before its shape is perfectly formed,&#xD;
then immortality dpes not follow.&#xD;
But what becomes of the monad, the germ, the humani&#xD;
point, the divine spark,. the pivot ? Answer-It re-'&#xD;
mains with and in the fetal body till dissolution and&#xD;
decay shall set it free.' Whereupon it floats again in&#xD;
&#xD;
the spiritual atmosphere, until it is inhaled by a human&#xD;
male, again,-whereupon it is, perhaps, and perhaps not,&#xD;
sent forth upon its mission once again.&#xD;
Question-We sometimes see double-men, as the twins&#xD;
of Siam; and others still more remarkable, as one body&#xD;
with two heads; are there two souls also? Answer-&#xD;
Every true human brain contains a true and independ-&#xD;
ent human soul. All men's brains contain vast numbers&#xD;
of monads; hundreds of these seek incarnation on every&#xD;
occasion, but only one or two, very rarely three or more,&#xD;
succeed at that time!/ The rest, those that fail, float&#xD;
about as before.&#xD;
Question-At what period of life do men begin to at-&#xD;
tract these monads? Answer-At puberty, owing to pecu-&#xD;
liar chemical changes .in the physical constitution ; and&#xD;
females are capable of receiving and nursing them when&#xD;
a corresponding change has taken place in them.&#xD;
Question-Can impregment occur without physical&#xD;
contact?. Answer-Yes; by aid of artificial means, a&#xD;
monad may be successfully introduced, and life ensue ;&#xD;
but a very weak and imperfect life it must be, of ne-&#xD;
cessity.&#xD;
Having once entered upon this grand'subject, I deter-&#xD;
mined to make the series of questions nearly, if not&#xD;
quite, exhaustive; and, therefore, continued my inquiries,&#xD;
receiving answers as before-for, be it again repeated,&#xD;
no well-meaning human being can possibly ask a ques-&#xD;
tion, the answer to.which. is not recorded somewhere&#xD;
upon the secret tablets of the soul. In response to further&#xD;
interrogatories, many grand truths came flowing forth&#xD;
into the halls of consciousness; and, amongst other things,&#xD;
I learned that the purpose of sex on the earths was pure&#xD;
cohabitation, in proper human and God-sanctioned mar-&#xD;

riagewith prolification, or soul-incarnation, as the re-&#xD;
suit. But I also saw that this purpose was accom-&#xD;
plished on earth, and that that use of sex was ended at&#xD;
death ; that it absolutely does not exist in the Soul-&#xD;
world. But in the diddle State, as a terrible phan-&#xD;
tasy, lust and all other abominations abound ; and I&#xD;
saw that one great cause of the moral looseness of thou-&#xD;
sands of sensitive-nerved people on earth resulted from&#xD;
the infernal possessions and obsessions of their persons&#xD;
by delegations from those realms of darkness and-to&#xD;
al but themselves-unmitigated horror. A sensitive&#xD;
gi, - or woman-no matter how virtuously inclined---&#xD;
may, unless by prayer and constant watchfulness they&#xD;
prevent it, and keep the-will active and the sphere en-&#xD;
tire; be led into the most abominable practices and hab-&#xD;
its. Many of these denizens of the mid-regions of space&#xD;
are insane-in the higher sense all are so--and'to them&#xD;
lust and its gratifications, dram-drinking, and mal-prac-.&#xD;
tice of all sorts, is a reality, although to others they are&#xD;
cruel phantasies. The belief of these unfortunates re-&#xD;
sults from their former habits, voluntary self-illusion,&#xD;
and their old memories and associations, and they are.&#xD;
devil-kings, gamblers, and keepers of seraglios-some-&#xD;
thing on the same principle that a straw-crowned maniac&#xD;
is to himself, and other of his ilk, a regal and potent&#xD;
brow-gemmed monarch--a species of insanity generally&#xD;
the result of personal excess and congenital disease;&#xD;
and one, also, that it is very difficult to cure, either in the&#xD;
Spirtworid or anywhere else, for the reason that no&#xD;
man can be healed, morally or physically,,from or by&#xD;
extenal applications ; the recreative work must be&#xD;
commenced and carried on from within, ornot at all.&#xD;
Are the destinies of all human beings parallel? An-&#xD;
&#xD;
swer-No. On earth there are seven distinct orders&#xD;
of mankind, and so there is beyond it. 'It is dffi-&#xD;
cult to name these last without resorting to Orien.&#xD;
tal terms ; but, as these will serve to convey something.&#xD;
of the truth, I will attempt to classify them as follows:&#xD;
1st, Spirits-Angels; 2nd, Seraphs; 3rd, Arsapham&#xD;
4th, Eons ; 5th, Arsasaphs ; 6th, Arch-Eons; .7th, TW&#xD;
Autarphim.&#xD;
Is this all?  No. For the highest of the last five&#xD;
orders-ultimate in a Perfection whereof the human nind&#xD;
cannot conceive. They become Deions, a supreme or-&#xD;
der of creative intelligences and energies, whose power,&#xD;
in combination, is only second to that of the Infinite&#xD;
God Himself. These constitute the.towering hierarchy&#xD;
of the supernal Heaven. Their number is infinite. Nor&#xD;
hath ever a man born on earth reached nearer their&#xD;
glorious state than the second on the list, (Ser.aphs).&#xD;
They are creative energies, you say ; if so, where is&#xD;
the field of their activities ? Answer-The Amorphous&#xD;
Universe, circuinvolving the material creation!&#xD;
Is space then bounded?. Yes !&#xD;
By what ? I have just answered.&#xD;
.But what proof is there that this. tremendous state-&#xD;
ment is correct? Answer-The nebulous masses re-&#xD;
vealed by the telescope ; masses constantly being ladled&#xD;
out, so to speak, of the immense sea of nascent ,matter,&#xD;
by the awful powers to whom that mighty task is s-&#xD;
signed,and by those same powers changed or condensed&#xD;
into fire-mist, ire, cometary bodies, suns, planets, life&#xD;

These were a few of the answers that came to me, as&#xD;
we turned from the precipice, and moved once more&#xD;
toward the sylvan grove !&#xD;
Measured by earthly clocks, I had been but two hours&#xD;
in the Soul-world, but felt that I had endured for cen-&#xD;
turies.&#xD;
I soon discovered the reason of this. There is, as&#xD;
said before, a great sympathetic chain extending from&#xD;
sou1 to soul, over and through all past time, and up to&#xD;
God likewise; and on the plane of this great Sympathia,&#xD;
at every point, some one stands ; that some one can scan&#xD;
the past, the present, and the future, just in proportion&#xD;
to his or her unfolding ; and the true blending of that&#xD;
soul with some other, puts this last in possession of all&#xD;
the other may have attained. I loved and was loved'&#xD;
by one who stood high thereon, and the intuitions of my&#xD;
soulwere quickened by his presence.&#xD;
Purity is the price of power. * * *J * Years of&#xD;
earth have passed since that auspicious opening of the&#xD;
inner life. Much greater and higher knowledge has&#xD;
since flowed into my soul, portions of which will, ere&#xD;
long, be given to the world by the same pen which in-&#xD;
dited every line this book contains-save the preface.&#xD;
At present I am, with Mhie, endeavoring to gain wis-&#xD;

&#xD;
just above the surface-just high enough to be breathed&#xD;
by those who move along the by-lanes of Vanity Fair:&#xD;
and the Soirl took a key from its girdle, and therewith&#xD;
unlocked the door which alone had prevented its ascen-&#xD;
sion to the upper story of the Temple ; and it saw the&#xD;
steps leading toward the Dome-and they were broad, in-&#xD;
viting, well carpeted and lighted. Up the steps it went,&#xD;
and presently reached a lofty apartment, -within which&#xD;
there fell a flood of glorious effulgence ; and this light&#xD;
was clear, and pure, and pearly white ; and it streamed&#xD;
into the apartment,-this upper chamber of the soul,--&#xD;
through a glorious arched window, toward which it&#xD;
drew near, and lo! all' the world looked different, as&#xD;
did the stars that hung out upon the gt, and the&#xD;
beautiful pale moon, and God's rockets-the meteors&#xD;
---so beautiful !&#xD;
There was an occupant of that chamber, one who had&#xD;
been slumbering on a couch therein for many, many&#xD;
years; but the grating of the door upon its rusted,&#xD;
hinges and the rattle of the keys disturbed this sleeper,&#xD;
and woke it up. The being was a female-so very beau-&#xD;
tiful that I loved her from the first, for she was very&#xD;
beautiful, and came to me, threw her fair white arms&#xD;
about my neck, kissed my forehead tenderly, told me&#xD;
that she had slept too long, pent up in that chamber all&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
And I loved her deeply, because she was so very&#xD;
pure, so virginal, so fresh and innocent, and withal so&#xD;
very beatitiful! I asked her name. "It is Devotion,"&#xD;
she replied. Then folding me to her bosom, her tender,&#xD;
loving bosom, she gently drew me nearer to the win-&#xD;
dow, pointed down toward the ground,, and said:."The&#xD;
air is thick, and dank, and dark, and dense, and very&#xD;
&#xD;
murky. It is difficult to catch a glimpse of the bright&#xD;
orb'of the Heavens, or to feel his genial ray down there,&#xD;
in that thick and heavy air ; but here, tip here, the&#xD;
atmosphere is purer, and, if you look well and steadily&#xD;
through that pane, you will see the Spirit of God as He&#xD;
moves across the mighty deep 1" And I looked. A&#xD;
great Glory was at that moment marching across the&#xD;
whole bright sky--a mystic but a nameless glory-and&#xD;
the night was very grand ; the emotions it awoke were&#xD;
very soft and tender, so that tears welled up at the&#xD;
sight from the heart of Devotion, and suffused her&#xD;
beautiful features. Oh, magic tears ! One pearly drop&#xD;
fell on me, and lo I the icebergs of my soul were melted,&#xD;
and-I wept ;--and the waters, as they flowed, swept&#xD;
away many an obstacle that had thereunto impeded and&#xD;
obstructed my vision, and, soon I was able to see the&#xD;
Spirit of God in everything that He had made. Seeing&#xD;
which, the Beautiful Maiden gently chided me for so&#xD;
long delaying the coming up the stairs and the entering&#xD;
of that wondrous upper chamber whose windows look&#xD;
out upon the world below and toward the God above.&#xD;
And she told me how happy I might have been in the&#xD;
years agone, had not the lower strata of the atmosphere&#xD;
hurt my vision, and if I had unlocked the great door&#xD;
sooner. I asked the lovely one to reveal the methods&#xD;
by which, when I descended again, the recollection&#xD;
of the present golden hour might never be -effaced.&#xD;
Sweetly she answered : "All that .is necessary is to&#xD;
look toward the Dawn, and&#xD;
"When the dance of the Shadow at daylight is done,&#xD;
And the cheeks of the Morning are red with the Sun;&#xD;
When at eve, in his-glory, he sinks from the view,&#xD;

DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
In presenting what follows, wisdom dictates the nar-&#xD;
rative style rather than any other, for the reason that it&#xD;
is better calculated to entertain, interest, and instruct&#xD;
the reader.&#xD;
Not a few people, nor those of the least. informed&#xD;
class either, entertain many serious. doubts as to the&#xD;
nature, perdurability, immortality, and eternality of the&#xD;
human soul. Of the last, probably no one in the body&#xD;
can ever be absolutely certain and assured; but of the&#xD;
former, all may be ; not, perhaps, by means of what&#xD;
herein ensues concerning the points named, but by rea.&#xD;
son of that greater knowledge whereof what follows is&#xD;
the key. I present the subjoined as seriously as could&#xD;
anything be. To my soul the truths here revealed,&#xD;
transcribed from the experimental knowledge-tablets of&#xD;
that very soul itself, are priceless, and worth as much&#xD;
more than what people generally receive and accept as&#xD;

DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
a famous philosopher, known to us through history as&#xD;
Thales,the Milesian ; and there is no doubt but that he,&#xD;
was one of the first, if not the very first man of great&#xD;
mental rank and caliber, who publicly taught the doc-&#xD;
trine of human immortality.&#xD;
Doubtless the same general train of reasoning re-&#xD;
sorted to by Thales was nearly, if not quite, identical&#xD;
with that which constitutes the basis of nearly all hu-&#xD;
man hope to-day, if we except the modern 'Spiritual'&#xD;
theory, which, while very comforting and satisfactory&#xD;
to great numbers, is far from being so to millions more ;&#xD;
for there are quite a number of questions which a doubting&#xD;
man may ask of those who predicate an hereafter upon&#xD;
the evidence furnished by the 'Spiritualism' of the day,&#xD;
which those who are asked are not able to clearly and&#xD;
satisfactorily answer. To many, the reasoning of the&#xD;
'Spiritualists,' like that of the ancient, amounts to " It&#xD;
is quite possible that human beings are immortal;" and&#xD;
that is all. Many a man and woman are dying daily,&#xD;
deaths from the fearful doubts that constantly arise as&#xD;
to the truth of the immortality of the Soul ; doubts, too,&#xD;
that will still insist on coming pp, in spite of the start-&#xD;
ling phenomena of the 'manifestations' whose origin is&#xD;
attributed to disembodied men and women ; they still&#xD;
leave an aching void-a void which I am about to at-&#xD;
tempt to fill ; and, I believe, successfully.&#xD;
After the great Milesian, came other philosophers-&#xD;
men of genius, and intuition-who had dim and indis-&#xD;
tinct glimmerings of the great truth. Feeling, rather&#xD;
than seeing, that there must be a life beyond the body,&#xD;
they strove to impress their convictions upon others ;&#xD;
yet the sum total still amounted to but a probability, at&#xD;
best. As a result of the great search for light upon-&#xD;
&#xD;
a '&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WIrH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
159&#xD;
&#xD;
this mighty subject, many glimmerings of the truth were&#xD;
seen, but they were glimmerings only. - By-and-by came&#xD;
tlato upon the stage of the world's theater. He pro-&#xD;
duced 'Phaodo'-a great work, considering the times&#xD;
in which it first saw the light. It still remains so; and&#xD;
yet, so acute is the logical faculty of the people of the&#xD;
present era, that even that work fails of convincing.&#xD;
It is, viewed by the modern light, far, very far from be-&#xD;
ing a satisfactory performance, considering the immense&#xD;
importance and sublimity of the theme it professes to&#xD;
treat ; yet, nevertheless, Plato did succeed-in convinc-&#xD;
ing many of the people of the by-gone ages, as well as&#xD;
of the present, that he had indeed struck the golden&#xD;
vein at the bottom of which the wondrous jewel lies;&#xD;
and in establishing a - crude- conviction of that great&#xD;
truth, which the present century will doubtless have the&#xD;
supreme-honor of perfectly demonstrating. In the final&#xD;
conclusion, to which the world will shortly come, the&#xD;
author of these pages firmly believes that the elements&#xD;
herein given will enter as integers-as a portion and&#xD;
part absolutely essential to the perfect structure&#xD;
Plato, not unlike many of our modern savans, seems&#xD;
to have been sorely troubled-not so much in proving&#xD;
the immortality of the soul, as in assigning it a proper&#xD;
habitation after death. But the soul, like the body,&#xD;
must-have a home, he thought, and so he concluded to&#xD;
locate that home within the boundaries of the*'New&#xD;
Atlantis Isle,' situated, nobody, not even the -great&#xD;
thinker himself, knew where. The same difficulty pre-&#xD;
sents itself to-day; a thousand theories, or, more prop-&#xD;
erly speaking, hypotheses, are now .foat on the surface&#xD;
of the general mind, concerning the locality of the&#xD;
Divine City of Spirits--the home of departed souls.&#xD;

DALTN s WIT THE DEAD-&#xD;
&#xD;
The great majority of these suppositions are too mate-&#xD;
rial, crude, shallow and baseless, on'their very faces,,to&#xD;
even challenge the attention of a thinker for a single&#xD;
moment; others are too far-fetched; and not one of&#xD;
them all is there, but presents itself in the face of a&#xD;
dozen objections, from every one of ten thousand ob-&#xD;
jectors.&#xD;
That this assertion may not appear groundless, and&#xD;
seem to be dictated by improper reasoning, let us merely&#xD;
glance at the three theories held by the people who&#xD;
claim to know most about the matter-'Spiritualists.'&#xD;
One of the lights of that class gravely informs us that&#xD;
the spiritual world is located quite a distance on the&#xD;
other side of 'The Milky Way;' he and his disciples&#xD;
affirm that spirits can and do come back to earth daily;&#xD;
that our desires draw them, and that they, being there&#xD;
and feeling us draw them, instantly quit the land of&#xD;
bliss, and flit toward us, accomplishing the distance in&#xD;
'no time at all ;' which very indefinite period we may&#xD;
safely assume to be three or four hours, more or less.&#xD;
Now, light coming from the nearest fixed star at the&#xD;
rate oftwo hundred thousand miles a minute, cannot&#xD;
reach us in less than eighteen years-while light from&#xD;
any star on the further side of the same great belt of&#xD;
suns, requires a period of time too vast for us to -con-&#xD;
prehend; ere it can gladden our eyes.&#xD;
The Spirits' dwelling, according to this school, lies&#xD;
beyond even those vastly distant orbs. Supposing, how-&#xD;
ever, that it exists in the neighborhood of the nearest&#xD;
star, any spirit who gets here after a journey of three&#xD;
hours, must travel through space at not less than the&#xD;
rate of twdee thousand three hundred and eighty-seven&#xD;
MILLIONS Qf mites DURING EVERY SECOND of the wft&#xD;

The next theory, ~originated and advocated by the&#xD;
same person,* is, that the Spirits' home is on a sort of&#xD;
aerial belt circumvolving our globe. Said belt is fifty&#xD;
miles thick ; spirits live on its upper surface, which is&#xD;
very like this earth, seeing that it has cities, houses,&#xD;
streets, waters, oceans, rivers, trees, beasts, birds, and&#xD;
reptiles. At the poles of the earth, according to this&#xD;
same self-dubbed philosopher and his 'school,' there are&#xD;
certain openings or large holes, through which the&#xD;
spirits come and go just when it suits them so to do.&#xD;
When they depart hence, they go 'head up,' of course ;&#xD;
and when they come to us, they must approach 'Yead-&#xD;
foremost,' or with their feet toward their home-a very&#xD;
immodest way for some spirits to travel, if the dignity&#xD;
of their -sex is still retained-and a very undignified&#xD;
mode of traveling for the philosophers and magnates&#xD;
who so often talk to and at us, through the lips of mod-&#xD;
ern eolists.&#xD;
This, like the former theory, is unsatisfactory-but&#xD;
mainly on the ground of its gross materiality, for it&#xD;
makes the second life but a new edition of the first one.&#xD;
Common 'sense must reject this last. Of the two, the&#xD;
first theory is incomparably the most magnificent and&#xD;
grand. The fault is, that it is too much so ; for it re-&#xD;
moves us at one leap from the condition of humanity,&#xD;
and. at once endows us with the attributes and power&#xD;
of veritable gods.&#xD;
The next hypothesis concerning the matter is, that&#xD;
this world (our globe) is, and must, and will for all eter-&#xD;

nity be, the abiding place and, scene of activity of all&#xD;
mankind, who ever  have been or will be born on it,'&#xD;
through all the past and all the future ages. Accord-&#xD;
:       ;ing to this school (if I may so dignify it), Spirits are,&#xD;
here dwelling amongst us, taking note of all things that,&#xD;
oegur--are eating, drinking, and doing all that we do.&#xD;
Now, there is more common sense and reasonableness&#xD;
in these latter notions than in all the rest ; for of the&#xD;
many guesses at the truth, this comes nearest to the&#xD;
mark . The faults which this theory has, are, however,,&#xD;
verybad ones ; for, first, it materializes the soul ; sec-&#xD;
ond, 'it confines it-here, nor even permits it to leave its&#xD;
prison, to roam the starry fields ; and, third, it does in-&#xD;
justice to God and His omnipotence, inasmuch as it&#xD;
practically doubts his -providence, limits His power,&#xD;
and assumes that He was incompetent to provide, spir-&#xD;
itual homes for spiritual beings, and was compelled to&#xD;
make this a double world. If a spirit occupies any&#xD;
spaee at all, then, if this theory be true, not only is then&#xD;
surface above ground one compact mass of Spirits, but&#xD;
they form piles, extending far higher than our loftiesth&#xD;
mountains; for, since men have begun to die, they have&#xD;
continued to pass away at the rate of scores.of millions&#xD;
every year fcr at least a hundred centuries.&#xD;
I could not help disposing of this doctrine by means&#xD;
of the argumentum ad absurdum, for it was, and ever&#xD;
will be, totally unworthy of any more respectful treat-&#xD;
ment ; -and yet, as said before, it contains far more truth.&#xD;
than either of the others, as will very shortly be, if not&#xD;
already herein seen.&#xD;
People who lived in the days of Plato, Thales, and&#xD;
the great men of the olden time, could not have the.&#xD;
same notions that we have ; could got underatiandmany&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.          163&#xD;
of the wonders which we, in this age, fully comprehend.&#xD;
They could not conceive of a balloon, railroad, locomo&#xD;
tive, steamship, photo-picture, or telegraph, for the very&#xD;
plain and simple reason that the human brain had'not&#xD;
as a general thing, then unfolded many of its wonder-'&#xD;
ful and mighty powers. Its  immense capacities wed&#xD;
as yet nascent, latent, still. True, the seeds of 'alL that&#xD;
it has since proved were there, but in embryo only. In&#xD;
other words, the soul had not the requisite brain-organs,&#xD;
through which it could familiarize itself with all or any&#xD;
of the marvelous things just enumerated. 'So now, in&#xD;
these days, men and women worry themselves aggreat&#xD;
deal concerning the locus in quo of their fleshless friends,&#xD;
about the Deity or no-Deity question, and a hundred&#xD;
others of the like, not the least important of which is&#xD;
that concerning the nature, origin, and final destiny&#xD;
of the soul itself. Presently, in the years of the'race,&#xD;
if not in those of the individuals on earth to-day, the&#xD;
requisite brain-organs will be developed, the proper&#xD;
function of which shall be the furnishing of the soul&#xD;
with what it wants, in order to take notice of, and com-&#xD;
prehend the principles underlying its own existence,&#xD;
here and hereafter. Till then, the facts it sees must be&#xD;
admiitted, even while many of the bases-of these very&#xD;
facts remain involved in impenetrable mystery. It must&#xD;
take many things for granted-its own immutability irk&#xD;
cluded-in many instances, without any very perfect or.&#xD;
intimate knowledge of thewhy ?"-on the cogito, ergo sum&#xD;
principle.&#xD;
To return to the ancient philosopher: It aiybe re-&#xD;
marked that, although he had a vague notion of a con-&#xD;
sciour life of the soul subsequent to the dissolution. of&#xD;
its corporeal investiture, yet, unquestionably, te port&#xD;

of post mortem'existence, which he conceived, and Im-&#xD;
mortality-as the brightest intellects of the present age&#xD;
understand it-are two very dissimilar states or modes&#xD;
of being, and widely different in principle, value, nature,&#xD;
and results.&#xD;
It may be well to present an abstract and brief chroni-&#xD;
efe of the Platonic idea, in order to clearly indicate the&#xD;
divergences.&#xD;
To say nothing concerning Plato's doctrine of the&#xD;
Metempsychosis, or the Transmigration of soul from body&#xD;
to body--(which doctrine contains some truth, as doth&#xD;
nearly every notion man entertains, and which took&#xD;
its rise in the plains of Chaldea, was there found and&#xD;
adopted byt the great Zerdusht, or Zoroaster, from whom&#xD;
Plato borrowed it)-we will merely glance at certain&#xD;
others of his recorded opinions. According to Plato,&#xD;
the soul is double-that is to say, both material and&#xD;
spiritual; all souls pre-existed; originally, they were&#xD;
inhabitants"of Heaven, a place somewhere in the sky,&#xD;
whence they emigrated to the earth ; their sole mis-&#xD;
sion is to become " developed," which process is effected&#xD;
in this wise : Each soul must animate successively a&#xD;
prodigious number of bodies, every stage of their ca-&#xD;
reer occupying not less than a "period," which may be&#xD;
set down as one hundred years, and must be repeated&#xD;
an incalculable number of times ; they then return&#xD;
whence they eame-to Heaven; are permitted by the&#xD;
-gods to remain there for af$ allotted term, after the ex-&#xD;
piration of which, they are again compelled to go forth&#xD;
and occupy successive bodies, as before. Consequently,&#xD;
all human souls are, according to the Platonic theory,&#xD;
destined to nearly an everlasting repetition of the same&#xD;
general processes, are fated to an almost endless round&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
of defilements and purifications; of returns to Heaven,&#xD;
and dismissals to earth-not to speak of sundry sojourns&#xD;
in very bad localities on the route.&#xD;
Plato taught that these souls do not entirely-forget&#xD;
their experiences, joys, sorfows- or ambitions, hopes,&#xD;
cares and anxieties-in short, none of their varied eg-.&#xD;
periences during the several incarnations ; and that all,&#xD;
or any portion of human knowledge, at any given point&#xD;
of time; has notrthe.real acquisition of the present, as&#xD;
it seemed, but was composed merely of the memories,&#xD;
or reminiscences of innumerable past careers-the press&#xD;
sent recognition of facts and incidents which transpired&#xD;
in some pre-existent stage of their tremendous career.&#xD;
That these are truly magnificent notions, scarce any-&#xD;
one who can truly grasp them will deny, even though&#xD;
to some persons they may appear to be the very quin-&#xD;
tessence of poetry. Transmigration, in some form, has&#xD;
certainly been, if not hereafter to be, the lot of man. I&#xD;
do not believe the Platonic conception of"this great&#xD;
truth to be the correct one, nor that.man will ever un-&#xD;
dergo the doom again ; yet, that the soul has reached&#xD;
its present through many an inferior state, is a self-evi-&#xD;
dent fact to me. At all events, a formidable array of&#xD;
reasons might be presented to account for the faith that&#xD;
is within me.&#xD;
This idea of Plato's. completely antagonizes two of&#xD;
the most celebrated dogmas that ever held the human&#xD;
reason captive: .the first of which is the famous "Monad&#xD;
Theory" of Leibnitz, albeit he came very near the truth,&#xD;
as has been-seen ; and the other, the modern doctrine,&#xD;
that souls, like bodies, are formed, made, created here:;&#xD;
and that their origin is a common one-en utero. W&#xD;

have occasion to revert again to both of these latter&#xD;
doctrines. At present, let them pass.&#xD;
Plato nintained that the soul was Divine particu-&#xD;
tumr auae, an emanation from God Himself, a portion of&#xD;
His immaculate Being, detached for a time onlywand&#xD;
that after innumerable transmigrations it is re-absorb-&#xD;
ed into Himself again, and loses its own distinctive-&#xD;
ness. Of course, this notion, if it be true, instead of&#xD;
proving immortality, asPlato supposed, in fact dis-&#xD;
proves it altogether; that is, if immortality be conceded&#xD;
to be a continuance of personal identity, and an indivi-&#xD;
dual duration,-subsequent to the demise of the physical&#xD;
body. Immortality means a continued existence of the&#xD;
personality, and not a mere survival of the varied ele-&#xD;
ments whereof a human being is composed.. The parti-&#xD;
cular Deific emanations which constitute the souls of&#xD;
A, B; C and D, respectively, as soon as they become&#xD;
souls, are beings totally distinct from all else that&#xD;
exists, and'must forever remain so ; and "soul".can be&#xD;
predicated of either, only as beings thus separate, and&#xD;
therefore immortality can be the prerogative of man only&#xD;
so long as God and man are not blended into one single&#xD;
Personality. So long as each soul'shall think, feel, suffer,&#xD;
enjoy, cogitate and have a continuity of self-knowing,&#xD;
just so long will it be possessed of an invincible convic-&#xD;
tion of personal identity, under which circumstance&#xD;
alone, and only, can its immortality be truly predicated&#xD;
and affirmed.,'But, should'any soul ever be re-absorbed&#xD;
into Deity-again become a portion of Divinity-an&#xD;
utter, total, and complete annihilation of the individual&#xD;
must ensued; and that destruction of the human self-&#xD;
hoed would be as effective, utter and complete, as if the&#xD;
varied elements entering into it as constituents were&#xD;

whirled absolutely outsof the universe and into a blank&#xD;
nothingness.&#xD;
A tree sawed into planks is a tree no ionge, although&#xD;
the wood, so far as mere essence is concerned;mains&#xD;
as before. The tree as a tree is ruined forever, albeit the&#xD;
wood of it may endure for centuries. To sum up: All&#xD;
the theories of the Platonists, the followers of Thales,&#xD;
and the disciples of every one of the ancient philoso*&#xD;
phers, as well as those of scores of the modern" Spirit-&#xD;
ualists," especially of that peculiar school who, prate&#xD;
of immortality and annihilation in one and the same,&#xD;
the very same breath, are unsatisfactory ; for, after all,&#xD;
their boasted demonstrations of immortality amount, in&#xD;
their final results and effects upon our minds, to but&#xD;
very little more than pleasing hopes; and fond desires,&#xD;
and longings after immortality In what follows I have&#xD;
endeavored to solve the problem, in a somewhat novel&#xD;
way, it must be admitted ; yet I am in earnest, and&#xD;
have worked up the materials at my command in the&#xD;
most effective manner that was possible.&#xD;
The belief in ghosts, spirits, apparitions, wraiths and&#xD;
doubles, is almost universal. Millions of people affect&#xD;
to disbelieve in them ; and yet, deep down in the soul-&#xD;
caverns of these identical millions may be found all that&#xD;
exists in the minds of the most credulous. Disbelief in&#xD;
such things is very near akin to the asserted creeds of&#xD;
atheism. Thousands there be who in words4eny the ex-&#xD;

Lord !" fifty times'a day, and as often in the night begs&#xD;
God to have mercy upon his rack-tortured jaws. The&#xD;
fact is, there never yet was, there never will be, such a&#xD;
rara avis as a genuine atheist ; and in spite of all pro-&#xD;
testations to the contrary; there are but few who do&#xD;
nit believe to some extent in the existence of spirits.&#xD;
As with the rest of the world, so with myself; for, not-&#xD;
withstanding the chronic and hereditary scepticism of my&#xD;
nature,:a scepticism as unbending as iron, as inflexible&#xD;
as. stone, I, from early childhood, entertained a certain,&#xD;
vague, indefinite belief in the existence of the spectral&#xD;
gentry of another world; yet with this belief there was&#xD;
not the least realization in my mind that the objects of&#xD;
my belief had the faintest or most distant relationship&#xD;
to the human people in flesh and blood whom I daily&#xD;
saw about me. There was nothing very singular in&#xD;
that, however, for I merely resembled the millions of&#xD;
to-day, who, while entertaining the most undoubted,&#xD;
and,in some respects, salutary belief in ghosts, yet prac-&#xD;
tically seem not to have the most distant idea that in so&#xD;
doing they are fully accepting the mystic's faith,-that&#xD;
these self-same ghosts are but the spirits of mortals&#xD;
who dwell beyond the veil.&#xD;
Even in my early days I strove, by inquiry and by&#xD;
reading such books upon the subject as fell in my way,&#xD;
to find out whether this earthly life was the only allot-&#xD;
ment of man,-poor, care-ridden, unhappy man,--or not.&#xD;
Child as I was, I felt the incompleteness of all subsolary&#xD;
things, and longed to know if out experiences here&#xD;
were or were not all we had to hope for, or look for-&#xD;
ward to. The belief in ghosts did not help me any;&#xD;
for that ghost and spirit were synonyms, never once&#xD;
struck my mind. To the innumerable questions pro-&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
169&#xD;
&#xD;
pounded by me to my elders, in the expectation of&#xD;
eliciting satisfactory replies, the old stereotyped re-&#xD;
sponse was given,-to wit : Mankind have souls, and&#xD;
these souls live when the body is dead and returned&#xD;
into the dust of the ground ; but what the soul was,&#xD;
whence it came, what was its nature, form, shape -and&#xD;
size, and whither it went after the loss of its body, I&#xD;
could gain not the slightest information;, for every&#xD;
answer given me was as unsatisfactory as would be the&#xD;
Platonic theory to a modern philosopher of the trans-&#xD;
cendental order.&#xD;
After a while these-repeated failures produced their&#xD;
legitimate fruit; at first, a little doubt crept .in, and&#xD;
challenged all I had gathered. It grew apace, and&#xD;
finally settled into a sort of atheism, from which.I was&#xD;
happily rescued by my sister Harriet, and the good old&#xD;
Father Verella, a Spanish priest, by whom I was duly&#xD;
baptized and received into the bosom of the Roman&#xD;
Catholic Church, in my native city, New York. How&#xD;
long the connection lasted cannot how be told;' but&#xD;
something that occurred disgusted me, and forthwith&#xD;
the Pope had a new foe in my humble person. Years&#xD;
of doubt again succeeded after this relapse, during&#xD;
which the belief in ghosts grew stronger and still more&#xD;
'strong. My mind became subject to certain peculiar&#xD;
states,-a sort of raptness, so to express it,--a condi-&#xD;
tion precisely identical with that now claimed by&#xD;
thousands in tlie land, to be spiritually induced.' The&#xD;
supposition that it is so, may be correct, and it may be&#xD;
that this condition is the result of the development of&#xD;
a new sense or faculty in the mind: It matters not&#xD;
which, albeit I am inclined toward the latter'hypothe-&#xD;
sis. In these states to which I became at times subject,&#xD;

it seemed to me that I held converse with the ghosts,&#xD;

their, believed they were produced by a power outside,&#xD;
and independent of the girls, ye.t could hardly realize&#xD;
that human souls, disembodied, were the makers of the&#xD;
sounds.&#xD;
The result was an increased and intensified study, not&#xD;
only of the soul itself, so far as was possible by aid of&#xD;
an active intellect and quickened intuition, but also of&#xD;
its modes of action, its phases, and its moods. And,&#xD;
0, how my spirit loved to dwell upon its possibilities !&#xD;
Was. there any person in the country reputed to have&#xD;
a wealth of knowledge on matters pertaining to the&#xD;
spirit, I spared neither trouble nor expense ; but went&#xD;
forthwith to glean what I could from his or her precious&#xD;
stores. Of the "rappers," "tippers," and" table-turn-&#xD;
ers," I soon became 'wearied ; for, as a class, they&#xD;
amounted to but little, and, with one or two exceptions,&#xD;
proved unworthy of confidence.&#xD;
At last, I went to visit a city in New England, where&#xD;
was :published a paper devoted to the illustration and&#xD;
diffusion of spiritual light, the editor of which soon be-&#xD;
came interested in me, (for people said that my ghost-&#xD;
seeing faculty was real, and that ,Lhad given incontesti-&#xD;
ble proofs, not merely of the power indicated, but also&#xD;
&#xD;
of what they were pleased to call clairvoyance). While&#xD;
sojourning in this eastern city, I came across a series&#xD;
of crayon sketches, copied from an old 'English work&#xD;
by their possessor, illustt-ative of certain portions of the&#xD;
processes of cosmical formation, according to the' Igni-&#xD;
genous Theory.. One of these drawings represented a&#xD;
vortical sun, discharging from itself countless hosts of&#xD;
lesser suns-a world-rain from the eternal cornucopia.&#xD;
The idea, even if it be but an idea, is a magnificent--aye,&#xD;
a tremendous one, and it attracted my soul very strongly.&#xD;
Many and many an hour have I sat gazing raptly upon&#xD;
that bit of pasteboard, which to me told a story too&#xD;
supremely vast and grand to ever find expression in&#xD;
human types or language ; and often have I been lost in&#xD;
the lanes of the azure, when striving to reach that al-&#xD;
mighty center of flaming fire, whence, starry systems&#xD;
rain down like snow-flakes in the wintry days.&#xD;
This particular crayon set me to thinking in'right&#xD;
good earnest ; as a result of' which, it appeared that my&#xD;
psychical vision became intensified. Test after test was&#xD;
given of this power, until the list rolled up from tens to&#xD;
hundreds, and people said, "If these descriptions of&#xD;
dead persons, whom you have never seen when living,&#xD;
and whom you profess to behold now, are not proofs of&#xD;
both the immortality of the soul and the ability to scale&#xD;
the walls which divide this from the upper worlds,&#xD;
what in Heaven's name will prove them'? It must be&#xD;
true that you, and hundreds of others as well, do really&#xD;
penetrate the heretofore unlifted veil." The dispda&#xD;
of these powers satisfied others, but to myself they still&#xD;
remained the weary, weary A's and the barren, barren&#xD;
B's; for, notwithstanding all that I had seen; heard and&#xD;
read on the subject of the soul's continuance, it was&#xD;

&#xD;
utterly impossible to actualize or realize my theoretic be-&#xD;
lief ; and this, too, at the very time that scores of per-&#xD;
sons, through the practical display of what I can but&#xD;
regard as a mere phase of psycho-vision, were trium-&#xD;
phing in a firm, solid, unshaken belief in an hereafter ;&#xD;
singular, was it not?&#xD;
That the soul can, at times, act independent of the&#xD;
body, I am firmly convinced. We see daily proofs of&#xD;
it in the mesmerist's art, in mental telegraphy, and in&#xD;
various*other ways ; this has long been an accepted fact.&#xD;
How often do wesuddenly think of a person, who in-&#xD;
stantly thereafter enters our presence, his spiritual part&#xD;
having preceded the physical! How often do we visit&#xD;
places during sleep which, in other days, we recognize&#xD;
externally ! How frequently we dream of persons and&#xD;
things unknown to us, and subsequently encounter these&#xD;
very persons and things when wide awake ! Many per-&#xD;
sons possess this power of independent soul-action, and&#xD;
can exert it at will. The writer has often done so.&#xD;
The experience about to be related occurred at a&#xD;
period when the skeptical mood was on my soul ; and&#xD;
it overtook me as I wandered distractedly on the bor-&#xD;
ders of the region of Despair. But this experience,&#xD;
strange, fearful, and even terrible, as portions of it were,&#xD;
had a beneficial effect ; for it lifted my struggling soul&#xD;
to hights of grandeur and glory, from whose sublime&#xD;
summits my vision 'swept the plains of immortality,&#xD;
and pierced the arcana of death itself !'&#xD;
Had the wisdom-lessons taught in this immense ex-&#xD;
perience been duly profited by, as they ought, I should&#xD;
have escaped many and many a bitter hour. But, like&#xD;
the majority of people, I refused to learn in any but&#xD;
the severest of all schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.          173&#xD;
It so fell out upon a day, that, having taken my usual&#xD;
seat before a copy of the marvelous crayon previously&#xD;
alluded to, and which I had rudely sketched, I became&#xD;
impatient at my continual failures to comprehend the&#xD;
subject it represented. Generally this had not been the&#xD;
case. My mind, on that morning, was unusually clear&#xD;
and vigorous; and yet, despite all efforts, I found it ut-&#xD;
terly impossible to comprehend the stupendous concep-&#xD;
tion-the Birth of a Universe. At last, heart-faint and&#xD;
sick at my failure, I abruptly rose from, the chair, re-&#xD;
sumed my walking apparel, left the room, and strolled&#xD;
carelessly and mechanically up the street, and continued&#xD;
listlessly onward, until I found myself beyond the out-&#xD;
skirts of the city, and entering the open country. It&#xD;
was a bright, sunshiny day; and after wandering about&#xD;
for nearly an hour, and beginning to feel a double op-&#xD;
pression-fatigue of body, for it was very weak and&#xD;
slender-and despondency of spirits-it struck me that&#xD;
I would turn short to the right, and lie down for a&#xD;
while beneath the grateful shade of a .natural bower,&#xD;
on the borders of a forest clump, hard by. This I did ;&#xD;
and having reclined upon the rich, green turf, under the&#xD;
leafy canopy afforded by the trees-rare and stately old&#xD;
elms they were-abandoned myself at once to medita-&#xD;
tion, speculation and repose. How long I thus lay it&#xD;
is impossible 'to tell; it may have been one hour--it&#xD;
may have been two or three:i all that I remember of&#xD;
the outer world of wakefulness is the framing of a series&#xD;
of questions, and, amongst others wherewith I interro-&#xD;
gated my deepest soul for responses, were these: "What&#xD;
is the immortality of man? What is God? Where&#xD;
does He dwell ? Is the life hereafter a continuance of&#xD;
this, or is it entirely different? Can it be only a shift:&#xD;

&#xD;
ing of world-scenes, or is it a change as widely apart&#xD;
from our earthly state as is -this last from the existence&#xD;
before birth ?" These, and many similar questions, my&#xD;
soul propounded to.itself, and sought, by an intense in-&#xD;
troversion of its faculties, to reach the penetralia of its&#xD;
being, where it instinctively felt convinced that all the&#xD;
momentous answers were already registered. Long&#xD;
and persistently was this endeavor continued, until, for&#xD;
the first time in my life, I became aware. of something&#xD;
very, very strange, and supremely interesting going on&#xD;
within me. This sensation was somewhat analagous. to&#xD;
the falling off into a deep sleep, only that it was the body&#xD;
alone which lost its outward sensibility ; it was the&#xD;
physical senses only that became slowly and gradually&#xD;
benumbed and sealed, while the mighty senses beneath&#xD;
them appeared to intensify themselves, draw together,&#xD;
and coalesce in one grand Albsense; and this contin-&#xD;
ued going on until it reached a strange and awful de-&#xD;
gree, and a sensation as of approaching death stole over,&#xD;
and, for a little while, frightened and alarmed me.&#xD;
With all the clearness of reasoning that I ever possess-&#xD;
ed, I applied myself to the work of fathoming what all&#xD;
this meant ; but the more strenuous the effort, the more&#xD;
signal the failure. Finding that the phenomenon taking&#xD;
place within, was governed by a law which pertained&#xD;
to soul-life alone, and that my ignorance of that mystic&#xD;
realm"was too great and dense to permit a full compre-&#xD;
hension of the enigma, nothing remained but to submit,&#xD;
and learn, as tinte wore on ; and, accordingly, giving&#xD;
over all att pts. to shake off that which, by this time,'&#xD;
held my enti being within its mighty and resistless&#xD;
grasp, I abide patiently the result.&#xD;
Slowly as moves the ice-mounds of Switzerland came&#xD;
&#xD;
the sense of coldness over my limbs; inch by inch the&#xD;
crafty hand of Mystery gained firmer hold. 'The feet,&#xD;
the limbs, the vitals, grew cold and leaden, until at last&#xD;
it seemed as if the ventricles Qf my heart and the blood&#xD;
within them were freezing, slowly, surely freezing ; and&#xD;
the terrible conviction forced itself upon me that I was&#xD;
gradually, but positively-dying!I&#xD;
Soon all sense of organization below the neck 'Was&#xD;
lost, and the words 'limb, body, chest,' had no meaning.&#xD;
This was also true of the head generally, but 'ubt of a&#xD;
something within that head. The bodily eyes and ears&#xD;
were the last to yield themselves up to the influence&#xD;
of the strange, weird;spell.&#xD;
With a last, perishing effort, I strove to look forth&#xD;
upon, and listen to the sounds of the world, now perhaps&#xD;
forever being left behind. What a doleful change in a&#xD;
few brief hours I Where all had been serenely, calmly&#xD;
beautiful before, nothing was now visible but the huge,&#xD;
gaunt skeletons of forms I had seen glowing with living&#xD;
verdure but a little while ago ; the sunlight was changed&#xD;
from silver sheen to a pale and sickly yellow, tinged&#xD;
with ghastly green. The overhanging branches and&#xD;
profuse foliage of the trees hard by had altered their&#xD;
every aspect, and from stately monuments of God's&#xD;
goodness, had become transformed into spectral obe-&#xD;
lisks, upreared on the earth to tell the future ages that'&#xD;
He had passed that way in savage and vindictive wrath,&#xD;
once upon a time. When I lay me down and gazed up&#xD;
into the beautiful heaven, the fleecy vapors were play-&#xD;
ing at cloud-gambols on the breast of the vault ; but&#xD;
now they were turned into funereal palls, heavy, black,&#xD;
and gloomy as are the coverlets of Night; and the&#xD;
busy hum of myriad insects, and the gentle murmur of&#xD;

&#xD;
the zephyr moving through the bushes, no longer pleased&#xD;
the ear by their soft, low buzz, but smote upon my part-&#xD;
ing soul like a last and dirgeful knell ; while the warb-&#xD;
lings of the plumed songsters of the wood sounded to&#xD;
my soul like the sepulchral chants of Eastern sttry.&#xD;
Very soon the deep black pall, hung out upon the face&#xD;
of heaven, began slowly and remorselessly to come down,&#xD;
down, down, until my nostrils snuffed the vapors and&#xD;
sensed the odors of the grave. The far-off horizon bi-&#xD;
gan cautiously to approach me, shutting out first one&#xD;
window of the sky and then another, until at last but&#xD;
a little space of light was left; and still the cloud-walls&#xD;
drew nearer, nearer still ; the darkness and the fetor&#xD;
grew more fearfully dense by degrees ; I gasped for&#xD;
breath the effort pained me, and was fruitless ; and the&#xD;
horrible agony consequent thereupon, for one moment&#xD;
re-illumed the brain ; and the dreadful possibility, nay,&#xD;
the probability, that I was to .die there alone, with no&#xD;
loved hand to smoothe my brow, no lip to kiss me 'good-&#xD;
bye,' no tearful eye to watch my parting hour, sent a&#xD;
thrill along my brain almost too intense for endurance.&#xD;
The conviction that I must perish, uncared for by kind&#xD;
friends; out there in the wood, beneath the blue sky and&#xD;
the green trees, seized upon my soul, and the cold beads&#xD;
of perspiration that oozed from my brow and trickled&#xD;
down to the ground, attested the degree of mental agony&#xD;
I was undergoing. 'Good-bye, all ye beauties of the&#xD;
sense-world ! farewell, all whom I have loved or been&#xD;
loved byI' I mentally said ; and then, by a strong&#xD;
effort of will, nerved -my soul for its expected flight.&#xD;
Soon there came a thrill, a shudder, an involuntary&#xD;
'God, receive me!1' and I felt that I was across the&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.      177&#xD;
&#xD;
Mysty River, and stood within the awful gates of--&#xD;
ETERNITY I&#xD;
The majority of people imagine the Soul-world to be&#xD;
spdi4lly (to coin a good word) outside of this sphere;&#xD;
and so it is, in one sense ; but in another, it is not. A&#xD;
notion of what I mean may be had by comparing the&#xD;
other and higher with certain phases of the true dream-&#xD;
life. The scenes of action of either are totally removed&#xD;
from both time and space, and yet the events of each&#xD;
are actual experiences of the soul ; for even in dream-&#xD;
life we suffer and enjoy quite as keenly as in the wake-&#xD;
ful world of grosser sense. A woman who sleeps and&#xD;
dreams, finds herself in two widely-different states within&#xD;
the four-and-twenty hours. Now, the normal spiritual&#xD;
state is very like a prolonged dream-life, to which our&#xD;
world-sense or earthly condition is just the same as is&#xD;
spiritual clairvoyance toan inhabitant of the physical&#xD;
body ; that is to say, it is possible for spiritual beings&#xD;
to become en rapport with this earthly world, and the&#xD;
interests, persons and things thereof ; but this is not&#xD;
their normal state or condition, any more than the&#xD;
clairvoyance,.induced mesmerically, is the normal state&#xD;
of the subject possessing the faculty.&#xD;
It requires long and persistent effort to induce a con-&#xD;
dition in a human being, which will for a time intromit&#xD;
him into the greater or lesser Soul-worlds ; and just&#xD;
so it is no easy matter for the inhabitants of those higher&#xD;
and highest worlds to become en rapport with this.&#xD;
These remarks are introductory to what follows.&#xD;
After the first great thrill of terror had passed over,&#xD;
I became comparatively calm, and soon -lost all :on-&#xD;
sciousness whatever. Not a sensation ever felt before&#xD;
in all my life was experienced now, but a new magazine&#xD;

&#xD;
of emotions seemed to have suddenly been opened in&#xD;
the depths of my being, and began to usurp the places&#xD;
of the old ones.&#xD;
Some years subsequent to the events now detailed, I&#xD;
read the wonderful experiences of several persons, who&#xD;
had taken the oriental drug known as hasheesh, and1 a&#xD;
few years thereafter was induced to make an experi-&#xD;
ment upon niyself with a little of the powerful stimu&#xD;
lant. I became fully conversant with its influence, but&#xD;
in no instance was there the least similarity between&#xD;
the condition it brought on and the state in which I was&#xD;
when reclining beneath the bower in the wood. I have&#xD;
known the fullest, .deepest, most intense effect of that&#xD;
singular drug ;* but nothing I ever experienced from&#xD;
it-nothing I ever read of as having been experienced&#xD;
by others who had foolishly taken it-at all resembled&#xD;
the sensations to which I awoke under the trees near&#xD;
that eastern city. Gradually the sense of lostness, which&#xD;
for a time possessed me, passed away, and was succeeded&#xD;
by a consciousness altogether distinct from that of&#xD;
either the dream or the ordinary wakeful condition.&#xD;
Not a sensation ever previously experienced-not even&#xD;
in the very soul-vaults of my being-now swept the&#xD;
nerve-harp within, to solace, actuate or annoy ; but, in-&#xD;
stead, there .came an indefinable PLEASURE-sENE-a&#xD;
sort of hyper-sensual ecstasy, by no means organic, but&#xD;
diffused over the entire being. I have every reason to&#xD;
believe that this feeling is always experienced by the&#xD;
newly dead. Persons who have'been resuscitated after&#xD;
drowning, suspension by the neck, and asphyxia, all&#xD;
unite in testifying, that so far as their experience went,&#xD;
*"Nothing on earth could ever induce me to take a drachm of this&#xD;
accursed drug again.&#xD;
&#xD;
death was a pleasant feeling, and its joys supreme, even&#xD;
ii what to spectators may have seemed the terrible&#xD;
passing hour. This sensation, like all others, cannot&#xD;
be verbally described ; it was as if the keenest pleasures&#xD;
known to us in the body were infinitely prolonged and&#xD;
strung out over the entire nerve-sea, instead of a single&#xD;
organ or two.&#xD;
I cannot perhaps convey my meaning to some people&#xD;
better than by saying that. the sensation was akin to&#xD;
the feeling of an instantaneous relief from the most ex-&#xD;
cruciating pain-the toothache, for instance.  I was&#xD;
not, at first, conscious of possessinga body ; not even&#xD;
the ultra-sublimated material one of which we hear so&#xD;
much said in these latter days; but a higher, nobler&#xD;
consciousness was mine-namely, a supremely radiant&#xD;
soul-majesty.&#xD;
My ears did not hear; but Sound-Nature's music--&#xD;
the delicious, but still melodies of earth and space, and&#xD;
all things else, seemed to pour in upon my ravished&#xD;
soul, in rich full streams, through a thousand avenues.&#xD;
The eye did not see, but I was all sight. There was no&#xD;
organ of locomotion, as on the earth, nor were such&#xD;
needed ; but my spirit seemed to be all motion, and it&#xD;
knew instinctively, that by the power of the thought-&#xD;
wish, it could reach any point within the boundaries of&#xD;
earth where it longed and willed to be ; but. not a sin-&#xD;
gle*yard beyond it. Let it be -here distinctly under-&#xD;
stood, that the condition in which. I now found myself,&#xD;
was precisely the same as that of the higher class, of&#xD;
spiritual beings, when they are in .the peculiar state&#xD;
wherein they can for a limited period, and to a certain&#xD;
extent, become connected with this world, wherein they&#xD;
have once lived, and from which they have passed over&#xD;

the bridge of Death to the brighter realms beyond ; in&#xD;
other words, I was connected with two worlds, and the,&#xD;
states.incident to the residents of both, at one and the&#xD;
same time.&#xD;
Distinctively and most clearly does memory retain.&#xD;
all the marvelous changes from the pre-state of that&#xD;
auspicious afternoon.&#xD;
What is especially remarkable, is, that the condition&#xD;
was so peculiar, that the freed soul could, and did, after&#xD;
a tire, take close notice of material things, even while&#xD;
that same soul-gaze penetrated the surface, and beheld&#xD;
their essences. The vision was not bounded by the&#xD;
obstacles which impede ordinary sight. Every object&#xD;
was, more or less, transparent ; and one very singular&#xD;
peculiarity of all bodies, of whatever kind, was this:&#xD;
the trees, stones, hills, mountains, everything, appeared&#xD;
as if composed of absolute fire.  A certain object I&#xD;
knew, from its shape, to be a large tree, with brown&#xD;
bark,. white wood, and green leaves ; yet none of these&#xD;
colors were there now, but instead, the trunk appeared&#xD;
to be a huge cylinder of gray fire, not in one mass, but&#xD;
in interwoven streaks, all actively flaring upward, and&#xD;
bound together by a circle of brighter fire (the inner&#xD;
bark), which in turn was encompassed by a dull brown&#xD;
band of faintly flickering flame. Each leaf was, also&#xD;
nothing but a vari-formed disk of purple and orange&#xD;
fire. Thus it was with all that I beheld.&#xD;
Fire, in someform, constitutes the life of all beings,&#xD;
of whatsoever nature; of this I am firmly convinced.&#xD;
These strange sights caused me to reason in this wise:&#xD;
"If dull matter is so filled with the divine luminescence,&#xD;
what must be the appearance of a human being? Surely&#xD;
a man must present an astonishing sight! Of a cer-&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITI THE DEAD.       181&#xD;
&#xD;
tainty," said I, "this must be Eternity, and I am now a&#xD;
free soul! 0, that I might behold- another soul than&#xD;
mine, and learn somewhat of its mysteries, and reach&#xD;
the understanding of a few of the deeper things of its&#xD;
nature." Scarcely had this desire taken form, than a&#xD;
sense of involuntary motion-took possession, and I felt&#xD;
myself slowly and positively rising in space, at an angle&#xD;
of eighty degrees with the horizon. Amazement! The&#xD;
sensation was not unpleasant ; but as the ground re-&#xD;
ceded apparently, the novelty of the situation produced&#xD;
emotions that most certainly were. It is impossible to&#xD;
describe one's feelings; nor shall such an %attempt be&#xD;
here essayed. Suffice it therefore, that I rose to such a&#xD;
height, that, judging by the faint gleams of the earth-&#xD;
fires in the hills, and the indistinct shimmering of the&#xD;
city itself, I conjectured, that when at the highest point,&#xD;
not less than five miles, in a straight line, separated me&#xD;
from the peak of the tallest mountain within sight.&#xD;
Having reached this altitude, I began to descend the&#xD;
opposite arm of the triangle,,whose base was on the&#xD;
earth's surface, and reached the ground in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood of a city in central New York, distant from&#xD;
my point of departure not less than two hundred miles.&#xD;
Of course, it was impossible to even conjecture either&#xD;
the means by which this journey was accomplished, or&#xD;
the motives prompting the wierd power which effected&#xD;
it ; but whatever be the reasons'of my coming; one thing&#xD;
is certain-here I am, and nothing remains but to abide&#xD;
the issue, whatever it may be, thought I.&#xD;
Even during the mental perturbation, which was the&#xD;
natural result of tpe extraordinary circumstances in&#xD;
which I was placed, the question-asking faculty and pro-&#xD;
bensity of my mind-one of its leading traits-found&#xD;

sufficient time for exercise ; and many were the "whys,"&#xD;
shows, " and "what fors" which causality propounded,&#xD;
but to which at first there came no response. It is&#xD;
almost impossible-to convey an idea of the-strange pro-&#xD;
cesses by which knowledge flowed in upon my soul. It&#xD;
seemed to be absorbed. Knowledge, all knowledge&#xD;
may be said to float in the spiritual atmosphere, under-&#xD;
lying the coarser air men breathe; and in certain&#xD;
states, reachable by every human being, this knowledge&#xD;
is drawn in involuntarily, just as salt absorbs moisture.&#xD;
Near -the spot over which I hovered, [for the spirit&#xD;
cannot touch gross substance directly, but moves along&#xD;
on the surface of an aerial stratification near the earth:&#xD;
- these strata are 'about sixty feet apart, and there are&#xD;
transverse vertical and other lanes leading in all direc-&#xD;
tions through them,] stood a house embowered in trees,&#xD;
and in this house was a "study," and in that study I&#xD;
saw the object, above all others, which had been the&#xD;
theme of my longing, prior to the commencement of my&#xD;
aerial journey, namely, a man ; and that man was ap-&#xD;
parently educated and refined-for near where he sat&#xD;
stood a library of books, one of which he was at that&#xD;
moment engaged in reading. The title of the book&#xD;
was "Neander's Life of Christ."&#xD;
Calmly read the man ; still more calmly I observed&#xD;
him, and his surroundings ; and the result of these ob-&#xD;
servations was a firm conviction that the theories pro-&#xD;
pounded by-Newton, and generally admitted to be true,&#xD;
concerning light, color, and sound,, are not correct, or&#xD;
even approximately so&#xD;
No amount of disbelief on the part of .others; no&#xD;
amount of cavilling, nor reasoning can ever convince me&#xD;
that the experience now being recorded is anything less&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH, THE DEAD.     183&#xD;
&#xD;
than absolute fact-the direct contact of my inner being&#xD;
with the truths here related : hence I hesitate not for&#xD;
an instant in challenging the guesses of even a Newton,&#xD;
and offsetting against them the results of my own per-&#xD;
sonal inspection of the phenomena whereof his Principia&#xD;
treats. In the first place, there are many different kinds&#xD;
of light : in the present instance, there were two sorts&#xD;
in operation ; first, the rays of solar light fell upon the&#xD;
printed page, and with it a still finer, and more subtle,&#xD;
white and velvet light, from the eyes of the man him-&#xD;
self; which proved to me, that men gain a knowledge&#xD;
of external things by means of an absolute and positive&#xD;
irradiation from the soul itself, whose seat is in the cen-&#xD;
tral brain ; and this, through the medium of the optic&#xD;
nerves, retina and other delicate organs. In proportion&#xD;
to the central power of the soul, it suffuses and bathes&#xD;
everything in, and with, a subtle aura ; and this aura is&#xD;
that mysterious telegraphic apparatus, by means of&#xD;
which it issues its behests, and receives information.&#xD;
While gazing upon this beautiful sight I distinctly&#xD;
heard a bell ring; -and yet that bell was not sounded&#xD;
within two hundred miles of the spot where at that&#xD;
very moment the body of the writer lay wrapped in a&#xD;
death-like pall of- insensibility, as was proved by the&#xD;
actions of the man within the house, near which I stood,&#xD;
investigating the sublimest of all phenomena-namely,&#xD;
the Human Soul, its phases, modes and nature.&#xD;
The student instantly laid down the book and rose to&#xD;
his feet; not, however, to respond to the ringing, but&#xD;
to bid his three or four little mischief-loving prattlers&#xD;
be quiet, maw less noise, put aside the hand-bell, and&#xD;
not disturb him by its tinkling.&#xD;
All this was deeply interesting ; but what most at-&#xD;
&#xD;

184          DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
tracted my attention was the discovery of the fact that&#xD;
sound was not, as thousands of scientific men have as-&#xD;
serted, a mere vibration of aerial particles, but, on the&#xD;
contrary, was, and is, a fine, very fine and attenuated&#xD;
substance, which leaves any and all objects" that are&#xD;
jarred or struck-and leaves in greater or less volume,&#xD;
in pointed pencil-rays, single rays, broad sheets of&#xD;
various shapes, and in undulatory waves, according to&#xD;
the nature of the object whence it flows, the force of the&#xD;
blow struck, and the character of the object used in&#xD;
striking. It would be quite, worth the while for our&#xD;
savants to make experiments to verify, or, if possible,&#xD;
refute these statements.&#xD;
The man resumed his seat ; and I saw that from his-&#xD;
internal brain there proceeded to the outer ears innu-&#xD;
merable fibres of pale green light, and that the pencil-&#xD;
rays and sheets of sound, which were at that moment&#xD;
floating through all contiguous -space, came in direct&#xD;
contact with the terminals of what,-for want of a better&#xD;
name,-I will call fibres, or, more properly, fibrils ; the&#xD;
contact took place within the rim of the external ear,&#xD;
and the sound was instantaneously transmitted, or tele-&#xD;
graphed, along the auditory nerve to the sanctum&#xD;
sanctorum of his very soul.&#xD;
The question naturally arises in the reader's mind at&#xD;
this point: "  How was it possible for you to become&#xD;
cognizant of sound under the very peculiar circum-&#xD;
stances and conditions by which you were surrounded&#xD;
for the time being?  You could not hear by means of&#xD;
the outer ear and auditory nerves, for it is lain, if your&#xD;
story be indeed a recital of actual events, an not merely&#xD;
. a splendid philosophical fiction, that your material hear-&#xD;
ing apparatus' had been left behind you, in the body,&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.      185&#xD;
&#xD;
beneath the trees on the outskirts of the New England&#xD;
city ?" A very fair question this, and one demanding&#xD;
a fair answer. To it I reply thus : The human being,&#xD;
externally, is a multiple thing, at the bottom of which&#xD;
lies the invisible soul : Soul is the thinking, feeling,&#xD;
knowing essence ; spirit is its casket ; the body but its&#xD;
nursery-garments, the clothing of its juvenility. By&#xD;
means of the body, the soul, in which alone all power&#xD;
and faculty inheres, is enabled to come in contact with&#xD;
the material world. By means of its inner or. spirit-&#xD;
body, which is but an out-creation, it holds converse&#xD;
with the worlds of Knowledge, Spirit and Principle.&#xD;
The fibrils alluded to are not mere emanations from the&#xD;
physical brain, or its ganglia, but they are wires, one&#xD;
end of which is eternally anchored in the very soul itself,&#xD;
which latter is, of course, the man per se. The wires,&#xD;
though passing through, are by no means rooted in the&#xD;
corporeal structure ; hence, the han or woman, without&#xD;
a flesh-and-blood body, experiences but little, if any,&#xD;
difficulty in hearing sounds made in this material world.&#xD;
As it is with regard to hearing, so also it is, to the&#xD;
same degree, with reference to the power of seeing the&#xD;
corporeal forms of earthly things. The perfection and&#xD;
ease, however, with which this is done, depends upon&#xD;
the normal condition of the disembodied man himself.&#xD;
If he or she, as the case may be, is sound, sane, clear&#xD;
and morally healthy, its powers, as with one yet in the&#xD;
flesh, are augmented and positive ; therefore it can, by&#xD;
processes already sufficiently explained, see, hear, feel, and&#xD;
even read, not only books, but the unexpressed thought&#xD;
of a person still embodied with whom he or she may&#xD;
for the time being be in sympathetic contact. Very&#xD;
seldom, however, can the recently dead do these things&#xD;

&#xD;
with the same ease and- facility that others can who&#xD;
have been over the river a longer time. This I have'&#xD;
abundantly proved ; and this, too, explains a point&#xD;
which, as certain believers in the Spiritology of the day&#xD;
inform me, has puzzled thousands of investigators, i. e.:&#xD;
why some of the dead people, with whom they claim to&#xD;
hold very' frequent converse, can only be communicated&#xD;
with by means of hard labor on their part, while others&#xD;
readily understand and respond. Some can faintly,&#xD;
others clearly see and hear;,some can correctly read&#xD;
people's thoughts ; others cannot, and must be addressed&#xD;
vocally ; others still require all questions to be written,&#xD;
in order that they may see and understand. The facul-&#xD;
ties and powers of dead people are doubtless as varied,&#xD;
dissimilar and unevenly developedas are those of per-&#xD;
sons on the hither side of Time.&#xD;
The study of. the human soul is a great one, and en-&#xD;
tirely worthy of a life's devotion. It has been mine to&#xD;
seek the solution of many of its mysteries, and in a few&#xD;
instances success has crowned the effort and rewarded&#xD;
the laborer. The final answer to the question is this:&#xD;
the sounds were conveyed to my inner being directly,&#xD;
and without the need of any flesh-and-blood organ of&#xD;
sense. Let us now turn toward a far more sublime&#xD;
mystery, namely: THE VERY SOUL ITSELF.&#xD;
h We %iged      be- u Z-A .&#xD;
WITH unmingled astonishment I gazed upon the man&#xD;
as he sat there in his quiet study. I had often been told&#xD;
that man was a microcosm, or a world in miniature ;&#xD;
but closer observation proved to me -that he was more&#xD;
than that-for, instead of a world, he was a universe of&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.          187&#xD;
worlds and mysteries, Q few of the latter of which were&#xD;
comprehended by me for the first time.&#xD;
Standing thus, I reasoned after this wise : ' Unques-&#xD;
tionably all the faculties and qualities pertaining to&#xD;
man, as we find him-upon the earth, are the results of a&#xD;
design on the part of the august Mind which placed him&#xD;
here. The purpose and function of these faculties and&#xD;
qualities, are to subserve man's best interests, his proper&#xD;
unfolding, and the divine purpose-here ; and, doubt-&#xD;
less, when by death he shall be transported elsewhere,&#xD;
to meet a new destiny and act in a new drama, other&#xD;
qualities and faculties, adapted to his- changed position,&#xD;
will be given him ; or, if already latent, will be duly&#xD;
brought into action. Perhaps their seeds are already&#xD;
planted in him; if sQ, they will assuredly spring up at&#xD;
death, blossom in the Soul-world, and bear golden fruit&#xD;
in that place, and at that period of the infinite year,&#xD;
when God shall so ordain it. We none of us know what&#xD;
we fairly are ; and no one, not even the loftiest seraphs,&#xD;
can tell positively what we shall be ; yet, that man is&#xD;
re-served, and will through all his trials be pre-served,&#xD;
for some great, some yet undreamed-of destiny or end,&#xD;
there cannot be the shadow of a Aubt. Nor will this&#xD;
final end be the mere eternal dwelling in the Valhallas,&#xD;
of which we sometimes dream ; nor in the 'spheres,'&#xD;
about which 'spiritual mediums' so glibly talk, nor in&#xD;
the gold-paved cities -whereof we so often sing. Our&#xD;
final destiny is none of these. Beyond all question, much&#xD;
of the knowledge acquired in the earth-life will be&#xD;
found at death to have served its purpose here, and&#xD;
will never again come into play.&#xD;
Not a single one of the grander, more noble longings&#xD;
and ambitions of the soul can find their field of action&#xD;

here ; but they are deathless ; and as God has provided&#xD;
a supply for every proper demand in all things else, so&#xD;
He has in this instance ; and therefore,.though the as-&#xD;
piring soul may pass away with its strong wings droop-&#xD;
ing, and weak for want of exercise, yet, up there-in its&#xD;
grand heaven-the air is pure and the field immense, the&#xD;
mountains tall, and the oceans wide ; and the eagle soul&#xD;
shall essay its loftiest flight, and grow stronger from&#xD;
the trial. What a person acquires here is but a pro-&#xD;
phecy of harvests to be reaped in the great hereafter.&#xD;
Man is really a unitary being, but seemingly is da-&#xD;
plex, and even multiple ; but this is seeming only, for&#xD;
in fact there is but one real sense in man-which truth&#xD;
I learned as I gazed upon the student in the chamber ;&#xD;
and that sense is intuition-the human sprout of an in-&#xD;
finite and God-like faculty, dormant in most people, yet&#xD;
incontestibly destined to an immense unfolding in all ;&#xD;
albeit, it is so deeply buried in some that it can only-&#xD;
express itself through organs. "And God said, Let&#xD;
is make man in our own image ;" and so He made him;&#xD;
but God is ubiquitous, omnipresent, omniscient-man is&#xD;
not ; and yet, if Scripture.be worthy of our regard, and&#xD;
Progress be not a iham and delusive dream, the tre-&#xD;
mendous prophecy implied in the line from Genesis just&#xD;
quoted is certainly to be realized ; and man is destined&#xD;
to move, through thorny fields-and slowly, it may be-&#xD;
yet stilt to move, towards UBIQUITY and OMNISCIENCE !&#xD;
Intuition is the sprout of which they are the full tree.&#xD;
True, man shall never reach absolute godhood, yet&#xD;
ever-will he move toward it.&#xD;
"If this be. so," says the caviler, "and God be sta-&#xD;
tionary, and ndt an advancing Being, there must come a&#xD;
time-even though when many a yet unborn eternity&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH TIE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
189&#xD;
&#xD;
shall have grown hoary with age-still there must come&#xD;
a time when man will overtake Deity ; and then there&#xD;
can no longer be a God I" Specious this, very I Why?&#xD;
Because'God, though not a-progressive Being, as we&#xD;
understand it, yet is infmite; and man must ever be&#xD;
finite. God's omniscience is what the word proclaims&#xD;
it-all-knowing ; but man shall be much-knowing. He&#xD;
is forced to approach Perfection in-straight lines, and&#xD;
when he shall have attained immense power in any&#xD;
given direction, there will still be forever germinating&#xD;
new faculties, before the untold millions of which there&#xD;
shall ever be an infinite stretch, a limitless field, an end-&#xD;
less road. God also is kaleidoscopic; and, supposing it&#xD;
were possible for man to reach the point of greatness at&#xD;
which Deity is to-day, yet one exertion of His volition-&#xD;
and,lo1 He presents a new aspect to the wondering&#xD;
souls of infinitude, more marvelous than before, and&#xD;
reveals points which will place a new infinity between&#xD;
man and their attainability ; and so on for all the&#xD;
epochs yet to be-epochs whereof eternities, as we un-&#xD;
derstand them, shall only count as moments in the ever-&#xD;
lasting year., Death is but an awakening, and there&#xD;
are to be myriads of -these.&#xD;
All this I-knew and felt ; all these. mighty-' foreshad-&#xD;
owings flowed into my soul, as, with clarified intellect,&#xD;
and spirit bowed down with awe, I stood gazing at the&#xD;
man within the chamber. More : Reason, the king-&#xD;
faculty given us hee, was only intended to act as our&#xD;
pilot through life, and will have fulfilled its main office&#xD;
when we step into the grave ; but very soon after we&#xD;
step out of it, on the other side, the UNION 'OF THE&#xD;
SENSES begins to take place, and the SENsN--whose ele-&#xD;
ments are the senses-comes into play-the all-absorb-&#xD;

ing Intuition. This uni-faculty is not a thing of earthly&#xD;
origin, though it here deepens and grows strong ; it was&#xD;
an integer of the original being-became a part of the&#xD;
soul at the very instant wherein it fell from God ; it is&#xD;
a triple faculty, and its role is Prevision, Present-know-&#xD;
ing, and Reminiscence.&#xD;
The skin of a man is not himself, although whoever&#xD;
sees one, recognizes something human. Beneath this&#xD;
skin is the muscular system, interlaced with a magnifi-&#xD;
cent net-work of nerves, all in the form pf, yet by no&#xD;
means the man himself. Next we come to the osseous&#xD;
system-the skeleton-the God-fashioned framework of&#xD;
the house he lives in-and a house only-one, too, that&#xD;
is. often let, to bad tenants, seeing how zealously they&#xD;
abuse it and batter down its walls. Now, when we see&#xD;
a skeleton, we know it-is something that points towards&#xD;
the human, yet do not for that reason, even momenta-&#xD;
rily, confound the bones with the individual ; for we&#xD;
instinctively know that the wonderful occupant of this&#xD;
bony edifice is, and to bodily eyes will forever remain&#xD;
invisible. Whoever looks for a man, must go below&#xD;
and above skin, flesh, muscles, and bones, to find him.&#xD;
Well, let the searcher enter the domain of the senses-&#xD;
a country that lies a long distance beyond the nervo-&#xD;
osseous land... Ah! here is the man, somewhere in this&#xD;
region of sense. Let's see ! one, two, three, five, or a&#xD;
dozen-no matter about counting them-yet nowhere in&#xD;
all this region have we found or can find the man. We&#xD;
are certainly nearer to him than we were awhile ago ;&#xD;
yet, not finding him, we conclude to go a little: further&#xD;
in the search. 'He dwells in the Faculties.' Not so;&#xD;
try again. 'In the passions.' Further still; not home:&#xD;
yet. 'In God-like reason, and the quality-parlors of viri.&#xD;
&#xD;
tue, aspiration, expression-each one step nearer the&#xD;
goal.' Go a little deeper, and in the centre of the brain&#xD;
you will find a WINGED GLOBE OF CELESTIAL PBIE, AN&#xD;

into less than three square inches of'surface. Here is&#xD;
the seat of the soul ; here is the Grand Depot, at whieh&#xD;

grandest palace of them all, is devoted to the Peerless&#xD;
Power--IrTuIToN I Born in man, it often lies perdu,&#xD;
or latent, till the final passage, and never bursts into&#xD;
full activity at once, save in very rare instances, as in&#xD;
the case of those wonderful genii, Newton, La Place,&#xD;
and men of that order ; and even in these, it is only&#xD;
partially active. It requires peculiar conditions 'for its&#xD;
expansion, just as the reasoning and other faculties re-&#xD;
quire time and exercise. The soul is really a divine&#xD;
monad,* a particle, so to speak, of the Divine brain-a&#xD;
celestial corruscation from the Eternal heart ; and, for&#xD;
that reason, an eternal existence-immortality being its&#xD;
very essence, and expansion constituting its majestic na-&#xD;
ture ; and the Soul, this monad, was once an integer of&#xD;
God himself--was sent forth by His' fiat-became in-&#xD;

and an attraction toward its ultimate Source stronger&#xD;
than all else beside. Here, then, I lay bare the very&#xD;
corner-stone of the splendid Temple of Progress, whose&#xD;
foundations are laid in Time, but whose turrets catch&#xD;
the gleams from the Eternal Sun of suns, whose warm-&#xD;
ing rays diffuse themselves over every starry island in&#xD;
the tremendous Ocean of Being     .&#xD;
Intuition is but an awakening of the inmost soul to&#xD;
an active personal consciousness of what it knew by vir-&#xD;
tue of its Divine genesis.&#xD;
Suffering appears to be one means toward this&#xD;
awakening, and the consequent intensification of the&#xD;
individuality ; and the passions of man, labor, and evjl,&#xD;
are also agents to this end.&#xD;
Man -is beset by evil on all sides, doubtless to&#xD;
the end that, in shunning it, and conserving the .self-&#xD;
hood, he may effect the earliest possible completion and&#xD;
rounding out of his entire being, and, consequently, be&#xD;
all the better prepared to encounter the immense des-&#xD;
tiny that lies before him in the Hereafter. * * * * * *&#xD;
And I gazed upon the man within the chamber'; the&#xD;
weather to him-but not to me, for I was totally unaf-&#xD;
fected-seemed , to be oppressively warm; and it was&#xD;
exceedingly difficult for him, after a while, to overcome&#xD;
the somnolent or drowsy influence thus induced, and&#xD;
prevent himself. frqm falling asleep. However, he&#xD;
made strenuous efforts to conquer the tendency, and&#xD;
for. a time it was mastered ; but, in the struggle be-&#xD;
twen himself and the slumber-fay, a secret was disclosed&#xD;
to me, and another beautiful arcanum  of the human&#xD;
economy revealed.&#xD;
The student of these pages will remember that ere-&#xD;
while I mentioned the astonishing fact-one of great&#xD;
&#xD;
value to all who think---that I was as a perfectly-dis-&#xD;
embodied soul during ,the experience now recounted,&#xD;
and could and did behold, at one and the:same time,&#xD;
both the external and the essential part of whatever my&#xD;
glance fell upon. 'The reader will perhaps arrive at a&#xD;
clearer understanding of what is here meant to be&#xD;
conveyed if this double power be thus illustrated :  .&#xD;
person may look through one glass vase at several&#xD;
others, many colored, within it, the last of which con-&#xD;
tains the image of a man, in still finer glass,-his eye&#xD;
resting upon the surface of each particular vase, yet at&#xD;
the same time penetrating and grasping the whole.&#xD;
Thus it was in the present case : I saw,-and what&#xD;
obtained of that student in the room obtains of all im-&#xD;
mortal beings;--the clothes; beneath the clothing his&#xD;
body ; and interfilling that, as water does a sponge, I&#xD;
beheld the spiritual man.&#xD;
lee let me define a few terms : Body is that which&#xD;
is purely inaterial, corporeal, dense, weighable, atomical&#xD;
or particled ; spirit is a thing of triplicity : in the most&#xD;
external sense, that which interpenetrates, flows&#xD;
through, from, and constitutes the life of material'exist-&#xD;
ences is spirit.; second, the great menstruum in which&#xD;
the 'universe floats and has its being is spirit, but vastly&#xD;
different from the foregoing ; and third,- the mental&#xD;
operations, as well as their results, are spiritual--a&#xD;
man's thought, for instance. ' Great care must be taken&#xD;
to distinguish these last two from the first, ; his the&#xD;
effluvium  from, or surrounding aura of     aerial&#xD;
forms and things. Soul is that more states       1e&#xD;
anat thing which thinks, feels, tastes, sees,&#xD;
pires, suffers, hates, loves, fears, calculatesand&#xD;

that my meaning only will be given to the terms used,&#xD;
we will now proceed. I became a rapt observer, not of&#xD;
the man in the study, as a person, but as a rare mechan-&#xD;
ism. The clothes he wore, emitted a dull, faint, leaden-&#xD;
hued cloud, perfectly transparent, and extending about&#xD;
three inches from their surface in all directions. His&#xD;
body was apparently composed of orange-colored flame,,&#xD;
and its emanations reached to the distance of fifteen'&#xD;
feet on all sides ; it penetrated the wood-work, walls,&#xD;
chairs, tables,-all with which it camein contact ; and&#xD;
I noticed two'facts : first, that its form was an oblate&#xD;
spheroid, and second, that a portion of it adhered to&#xD;
whatever. he touched.&#xD;
Thus it is true that a man leaves a portion of himself&#xD;
wherever he may chance to go: this explains why a dog&#xD;
is enabled to trace his master through the streets of a&#xD;
crowded city. * *-* * * When the man rose to silence&#xD;
the noise of his children, I discerned the form of this&#xD;
sphere, in the centre of a similar one of which every&#xD;
created being stands. Its poles were the head and feet,&#xD;
and its equator, whose bulge exceeded the polar dimen-&#xD;
sions about one-fortieth, was directly on the plane of the&#xD;
abdominal centre. This sphere penetrated that of the&#xD;
clothes ; and, although it was so marvelously fine, still&#xD;
it, like its exemplar-a large soap-bubble-appeared to&#xD;
be particled, or heterogeneous. Within the physical&#xD;
body of the man there was a second,-itself constituting&#xD;
another human form, like the vase within a vase. The&#xD;
substance of this last was beautiful and pearly; its mass&#xD;
was apparently in perfect coalescence,-indivisible,&#xD;
atomless and unparticled. This was the man's true&#xD;
shell-his house, his home,--the outbirth of, but not&#xD;
the man himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.         195&#xD;
And now the question is asked me: "What consti-&#xD;
tutes the ego : what is the man ?" The onsri-&#xD;
Soul is a thing sui generic, and unique. Sight, taste,&#xD;
and the senses generally, are some of its properties s&#xD;
reflection, reason, and fancy are a few of its qualities;&#xD;
-judgment its prerogative ;-physical scenes itsthea-&#xD;
tre ;-earthly experience its school ;-and the second&#xD;
life its university, whence it will graduate to-what ?&#xD;
This shall bye-and-bye be answered. Time is-but one&#xD;
of a vast multitude of other phases of existence, through&#xD;
which it yet must pass. We know something about&#xD;
its propensities, powers, methods and qualities; abut&#xD;
only a very little about the soul itself. We realize&#xD;
somewhat of its accidents and incidents, and not much&#xD;
else beside. Most assuredly, modern  Spiritualism"&#xD;
has not added much to our knowledge; it may do so&#xD;
in the future, but some of us do not like to wait.&#xD;
The human being may be likened unto a circular&#xD;
avenue, divided by a central wall, which separates the&#xD;
known from the unknown. We begin at the centre of&#xD;
this wall, our conscious point, and look toward the&#xD;
outer edge of the, circle ; we see one hemisphere, and&#xD;
one only. What pertains to the other hemisphere-.'&#xD;
the one behind this conscious point?' Make the tria,to&#xD;
ascertain what lies on the thither side ; seek to fathoim&#xD;
itereachedithyou, and what results ? Why the wall&#xD;
is reached, nothing more ; you strike it, think it, feel&#xD;
But, but cannot recede from nor look behind yourself.&#xD;
Bothat there is a greater mystery behind than the one&#xD;
before you is proved by the fact that your entire being&#xD;
is but the result of an infinite, propulsive power, which&#xD;
whirled you into being, but will never hurl you out.&#xD;

Well, the man strove to baffle, the tendency to som-&#xD;
nolence. His brain was one living mass of phosphor-&#xD;
likeluminescence ; there was a large and brilliant&#xD;
globe, apparently of white fire-mist, encompassing the&#xD;
head. Its center rested exactly on what anatomist&#xD;
call the corpus cdalosum; and this body-this central&#xD;
cerebral viscus-I affirm to be the seat of conscious&#xD;
nest,-the blazing throne of the Immortal Soul  I&#xD;
On other occasions I have beheld similar bright&#xD;
glob s of what can only be compared to pure ire.&#xD;
Others claim to have witnessed the 'same; they have&#xD;
described it, and uniformly, nay, invariably locate this&#xD;
ball on the precise spot indicated. The volume of this&#xD;
singular something, varies in different people; from the,&#xD;
bulk of a large pea to some three or four inches in mean&#xD;
diameter, in which latter case it, of course, has entrates&#xD;
axis in the place indicated, while its body pene&#xD;
the circumjacent brain. The effulgence, as thavolue,&#xD;
also varies in different persons. In some it is, compar-&#xD;
atively speaking, no brighter than the flame of a good&#xD;
candle, while in others it is an infinite intensification of&#xD;
the. dazzling radiance of the Drummond or the calcium&#xD;
light. In the man before me this globs was nearly a&#xD;
perfect sphere ; in other instances I have observed  s&#xD;
shape to be somewhat angular. The better the per-&#xD;
son, the greater the intelligence (intuitive, not mr&#xD;
memory-learning), the larger, smoother, and rounder is&#xD;
this wondrous Soul-Sun.*&#xD;
*T hienal globe is the sun of the microcosm ; a duller globe of&#xD;
ire, situated behind the stomach, in the Solar Plexus, is its moon, and&#xD;

In the student I beheld the operations of this.great&#xD;
mystery; Whenever the drowsiness came over hinti&#xD;
and he exerted his will to keep it off-I noticed that&#xD;
one side of this winged globe (for there'ere two&#xD;
wing-like appendages attached thereto, something l&#xD;

straightway a perfect stream of radiant fire-flecksf ent&#xD;
forth in the opposite direction, like sparkraysifrom thie&#xD;

brain, causing it to sparkle more brightly; they ran&#xD;
along the nerves, leaped to the muscles, and diffused new&#xD;
life and animation throughout the body,-which being&#xD;
accomplished, the globe resumed its former shape again.&#xD;
This struck me as being at once both sublime and&#xD;
curious ; but something still more so now took place.&#xD;
As I observed above, when he strove to keep awake,&#xD;
the globe became indented, from the outside, which was&#xD;
generally smooth,--albeit a countless multitude of filmy&#xD;
rays of light streamed forth in all directions--the sur-&#xD;
face meanwhile retaining its polished, burnished, and&#xD;
ineffably dazzling general appearance.&#xD;
The man laid down his book,.lifted a pen, dipped it&#xD;
in the inkstand, held it over the table for a while, and&#xD;
appeared to be concentrating his thoughts.; and while&#xD;
he did so the winged globe within his head began to&#xD;
enlarge until it occupied not less than four times its&#xD;
original space within the brain, This it did gradually,&#xD;
and as gradually resumed its 'former bulk ; but, in the&#xD;
mean time, his hand had flown over the paper, and the&#xD;
man had indited A THOUGHT! Anxious to know what&#xD;
the Sensations are the meteors, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., there being not merely a&#xD;
perfect correspondence, but a wonderful similarity, complete and&#xD;
full, betWeen the universe without and the universe within.&#xD;

this thought was, I looked upon the paper, and was&#xD;
surprised by observing a very curious phenomenon.&#xD;
The words written upon the paper were:-"The an-&#xD;
cients were far behind the moderns in general intelli-&#xD;
gence, but far, very far beyond them in isolated instances&#xD;
of mental power. Probably the simplicity of the lives&#xD;
of devout men of yore had a powerful influence in&#xD;
bringing out the concealed treasures, and in developing&#xD;
the extraordinary conceptive power which not a few of&#xD;
them undoubtedly possessed. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Job and&#xD;
the great Cathayan have never been equaled, in their&#xD;
several specialties, by men of later times ; it is ex-&#xD;
tremely doubtful if they ever will be. Really great&#xD;
men are few and scarce in any age, but popular men&#xD;
are plentiful in all eras. It is only the sad-hearted&#xD;
man,-he who stands and walks alone in they crowded&#xD;
cities of the world, shunned, laughed at, derided,&#xD;
scorned and unsupported,-who succeeds in engraving&#xD;
a ame upon the walls of Time; and of all that ever&#xD;
lived, Jesus, the Nazarene, looms up in such magnificent&#xD;
proportions, over the edges of the dead years, that we&#xD;
instinctively know that he was a real personage,-one-&#xD;
who lived and loved, suffered and died with, for, and&#xD;
among men ; and we reject the absurdities of Strauss&#xD;
and the Cavilers, and triumphantly proclaim that Jesus&#xD;
was not a myth. He sought to do good, and not to merit&#xD;
the plaudits of the mob, or of those who rule. A popu-&#xD;
lar man is one who keeps just within the front ranks of&#xD;
the human army, leading it whither its fancy and whim&#xD;
may at the moment prompt ; but a great man is one&#xD;
who volunteers to become the pioneer of the race, and&#xD;
is, at the sane time, the Herald of the coming age of&#xD;
Goodness. He feels the pulse of God in his heart, --&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.       199&#xD;
&#xD;
and he KNOWS to live and lives to KNOw. We are ap&#xD;
proaching an era when human genius shall be the rule&#xD;
and not the exception, as now. When that day shall&#xD;
dawn, the earth will fully blossom. It has painfully&#xD;
labored heretofore, and brought forth abortions-.-per-&#xD;
feet, seemingly, to their contemporaries, but, in view of&#xD;
her yet untested energies, abortions still."&#xD;
Now, the ink had scarcely dried upon the paper, and&#xD;
yet the dark violet of the aura, emitted by it when in&#xD;
the inkstand, and which rose from the paper wherever&#xD;
the pen touched it, was almost immediately obscured&#xD;
by a far brighter one, which proceeded from the gene-.&#xD;
ral writing ; by which I discovered that THOUGHTS&#xD;
WERE LIVING THINGS, ENDOWED WITH A BEING IN THEM-&#xD;
SELVES ! This thought was really a part of the man&#xD;
himself. I beheld a small cell within the winged globe&#xD;
open and emit a line of fire, which leaped to one of the&#xD;
cerebral organs, passing up one of the'fibrils and down&#xD;
the other-=thence to a nerve along it to the arm, the&#xD;
pen, and to the paper, where it became diffused and&#xD;
.sealed in the inky letters. And at that moment it came&#xD;
to me, from the far-off regions of positive Knowledge,&#xD;
that, should the paper containing the ideas be burnt, yet&#xD;
the 'THouGHT itself could ,never perish, because it was&#xD;
part and parcel of a Soul; -but it would float about&#xD;
in the human world-at some time be absorbed into a&#xD;
human soul, undergo a new gestation, and in due time&#xD;
be born again into the conscious realm around us.&#xD;
Much more the man wrote,; but at length his weary&#xD;
task and the sultry weather overpowered him, and,&#xD;
rising from his seat, he closed the blinds, threw himself&#xD;
upon the lounge, and in a few minutes was fast asleep.&#xD;
While watching the process, I became aware, for the&#xD;

first time, that I was being practically educated by a&#xD;
glorious being-an inhabitant of the Soul-world-whose.&#xD;
presence was now made clear, direct and palpable.&#xD;
This bright one conversed with me by a process not&#xD;
ily explained, but an idea of which may be gained if&#xD;
we call it infusion of thought. His lips moved not, and&#xD;
yt the full meaning he intended,-was transmitted, even'&#xD;
more perfectly than if by the use of words. Such be-&#xD;
inag can speak, but not so effectively as by the silent&#xD;
language.&#xD;
The object of his visit, he said, was to instruct me in&#xD;
certain essentials with reference to future usefulness on&#xD;
my pirk, but principally that the world might gain cer-&#xD;
tain needed light upon the soul, and its career, through&#xD;
a book or books thereafter to be written. His name,&#xD;
he said, was RAMus-that, in history, he was best&#xD;
known as Thothmes, or Thotmor, and that he was an&#xD;
Egyptian, of the second dynasty-a king, and the elev-&#xD;
enth of the line.&#xD;
this was all I learned of him at that time ; for after&#xD;
the brief introduction, he pointed toward the man upon&#xD;
the sofa, and bade me "Look I" The man was wrapt&#xD;
in deep sleep, and the winged globe within his head&#xD;
was rapidly altering its shape. First, it flattened out to&#xD;
a disk j this disc concaved toward the skull ; then it&#xD;
put forth a point in the' direction of the medulla oblon-&#xD;
;°   gata, into which it rapidly passed, entered the spinal=&#xD;
marrow, and ran along the vertebrae until it reached&#xD;
the vicinity of the stomach. Here it left, and instantly&#xD;
immerged itself within the solar plexus. The man was in&#xD;
a death-like, dreamless slumber. "The soul," said Thot-&#xD;
mor, "has gone to infuse new life throughout the physi-&#xD;
cal body, in doing which it also recuperates its own en-&#xD;

ergies. Souls can grow tired, but they find rest-not in&#xD;
inactivity,.as doth the body, but by a change of action.&#xD;
The mathematician, weary of figures, finds repose by&#xD;
performing chemical experiments'or in studying music.&#xD;
That man's soul is now supplying fuel to the bodyby&#xD;
converting the essences of his system into the pabulum&#xD;
of life. Presently its task will be finished, whereuponfit&#xD;
will again resume its seat upon the regal throne of 'its&#xD;
own mighty world."   *. *       *    *    *&#xD;
Thotmor ceased to speak. I turned from the sleeper&#xD;
in wondering awe, and, guided by the rare being at my&#xD;
side, felt that I was once more rising through the air.&#xD;
TURN where we will, ask whom we may, for informa-&#xD;
tion, we are sure to be met with the stereotyped "Know&#xD;
thyself." As well tell me to leap over the salt seal! I&#xD;
ask all mankind, the ocean, land, air, sun, moon, stars,&#xD;
history-everything else, both material ,and mental,&#xD;
sacred and profane-to point me out a single human&#xD;
being who really knows himself, or even approximately&#xD;
so. 'Where, I ask, is the wonderful mortal-tell, 0 tell&#xD;
me where ?-and from hollow space the echoes, mock&#xD;
me-where ?&#xD;
To know oneself ! The words are easily spoken or&#xD;
penned ; but to do it, is, of all things, the hardest and&#xD;
most difficult; for this very selfhood's personality is,&#xD;
beyond all others, the special acquaintance of whom we&#xD;
know the least,&#xD;
The sentence "Know thyself " was written over the&#xD;
porch of an. ancient temple. The man who placed it&#xD;
there must have been deeply spiced with satire and cyni-&#xD;

cism, else he certainly would have assigned mankind a&#xD;
task less arduous-a task compared to which the twelve&#xD;
labors of Hercules were mere child's play. Now, al-&#xD;
though this feat maj never have been accomplished, still&#xD;
it lies within the range of the possibilities ; and in de-&#xD;
claring that a man may, by study, find out both himself&#xD;
and God, I fly in the face of current philosophy, and&#xD;
deny the truth of the noted dogma of modern sophists,&#xD;
that " It is impossible for a man to explore the laby-&#xD;
rinths of his own nature :-a principle cannot compre-&#xD;
hend itself." Why is the logic of this doctrine faulty ?&#xD;
Because, first, God can certainly comprehend man. All,&#xD;
there is of man is mind ; all there is of Deity is the&#xD;
same. 'IA. principle thus comprehends itself.&#xD;
'Man is God's image, and can do on a small what He&#xD;
does on an infinite scale; and the only difference be-&#xD;
tween Deity and a full man simply is, that the former&#xD;
can comprehend the parts of the Realm separately and&#xD;
together, while the'latter can only grasp each truth as&#xD;
it swims to him on the rolling waves of Time's great&#xD;
sea ; yet, so fad as he goes, he comprehends himself.&#xD;
The day will dawn when, looking back at what he was,&#xD;
he shall fully understand the mystery ; and as he ad-&#xD;
vances, he will continually read the foregone scrolls,&#xD;
while new accrements of being will ever be his--each&#xD;
one in turn to undergo the scrutiny, each one to be Fully&#xD;
understood, and so on forever and for aye. Were it&#xD;
not so, Being would be worthless and our-existence :A&#xD;
dreadful farce. Secondly : Intuition has already been&#xD;
proved to be the shoot, of which Omniscience is the&#xD;
tree-which fact disposes of the absurd dogma just&#xD;
quoted, and forever.&#xD;
There are two mighty  *problems up for solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
These are : " What and where is God ?" on which I&#xD;
intend to write some day ; and the other is, "What is&#xD;
the Soul ?" which I am now partially solving. This&#xD;
last has proved itself to be the profoundest of all ques-&#xD;
tions, and very difficult of solution; but only so because&#xD;
investigators have mistaken their vocation, and an-&#xD;
alyzed afew of the faculties, qualities; and affections of&#xD;
the mind-all the while imagining the soul itself to be&#xD;
under their microscopes-whereas the soul was calmly,&#xD;
placidly looking -on, and wondering why they were so&#xD;
busily intent upon examining the furze and bushes, in-&#xD;
stead of the deep, rich soil whence they sprung.&#xD;
Faculty, Fancy and Dream-life are but three of the&#xD;
Soul's most common moods ; and yet metaphysicians&#xD;
have, confined themselves to but little else than their&#xD;
analysis. These are but three little rays from amidst&#xD;
a multitude of others, proceeding from one common&#xD;
source; yet, if even these were all analyzed, understood,&#xD;
and known, the great center whence they emanate&#xD;
would still remain as great a mystery as ever. Nearly&#xD;
all that we know of soul is really not of it, but of its&#xD;
methods of display.&#xD;
There is something more of man than life, limb, sense-&#xD;
faculty, affections, feeling and sex. There's a depth&#xD;
beneath them 'all,. and into, these deeps I believe it pos-&#xD;
sible to dive, and to bring up many a pearl, and crys-&#xD;
tal, and grains of golden sand from the floor of his&#xD;
being-from out the silver sea -of life, whose waters,&#xD;
flow soul-ward, and have their rise beneath the throne,&#xD;
whereon sitteth for evermore the Infinite Eternal-the&#xD;
great I AM: Aye, it is possible to know oneself, not-&#xD;
withstanding that, to ninety-nine persons in a hundred,&#xD;
there seems to be an impenetrable clod, circumvolving&#xD;

them-an obscurity, thick as darkest night, hemming&#xD;
them in on all sides. Yes, thank Heaven! man can&#xD;
untie the gordian knot, and triumphantly pass the Ru-&#xD;
bicon, but not over the bridge of Mesmerism, ocksession,&#xD;
drugs, or any of the ordinary means usually resorted&#xD;
to ; but through the continued exertion of STEADFAST-&#xD;
NESS, ATTENTION, PURPOSE, and wILL--the four golden&#xD;
posts to which are hung the double =gates, which open&#xD;
in both worlds.&#xD;
.Souls are, of course, the subjects of number, and in&#xD;
this sense are "particles,"--souls of course being plural;&#xD;
yet soul is not, for although you may subtract forty-&#xD;
eight from forty-nine, and leave a remaining unit, yet&#xD;
that unit is absolutely one; and you could-no more dis-&#xD;
member it, than you could find the lost particles of dust&#xD;
upon a midge's wing. Spirit is substance in absolute&#xD;
coalescence ; matter is substance, whose particles never&#xD;
touch each other ; and soul is a developed monad. A&#xD;
thought of a house is,'until that thought be actualized--&#xD;
surrounded with matter conforming to its shape-a&#xD;
monad. There was a period when God was alone ; he&#xD;
thought, and the 'product of that thought is the material&#xD;
universe, as we see it; he thought again-and o! those.&#xD;
thoughts, each one complete .in itself, took outer gar-&#xD;
ments, and became human beings. Far off, in the past&#xD;
eternities, God's thoughts'went forth; these were the&#xD;
nmonads. First, they entered into lower forms, then&#xD;
higher and higher, till at last they reached organiza-&#xD;
tions adapted to the perfect ripening of that which had&#xD;
all along been growing. The ripening produced In-&#xD;

numbers of diverse forms, these transmigrations lasted,&#xD;
and passed, it were impossible to tell. - We all have&#xD;
indistinct retrovisions, flashes of back-thought, dim and&#xD;
vague reminiscences of a pre-state of existence ; and&#xD;
we also know, that there are marvelous resemblances&#xD;
between men and the. animal creation, just as if the&#xD;
soul, on quitting an inferior for a superior form, re-&#xD;
tained something of its former surroundings and char-&#xD;
acteristics. Some men physically resemble the ox, lion,&#xD;
tiger, dog, owl, bat, deer ; and-we know that myriads&#xD;
resemble in their mentality the traits of character, hab-&#xD;
its and dispositions pertaining to all these animals, and&#xD;
others, as the fox, snake, eagle, peacock, swine, and so&#xD;
on to the end of a long chapter. "When I was a flow-&#xD;
er," said 'a little child. That child had an intuition of&#xD;
a mighty fact !&#xD;
Now all these astonishing likenesses are not acci-&#xD;
dental; but exist in accordance with the great law of&#xD;
Transmigration. Mind me: I do not say, or believe,&#xD;
that any man or woman was ever a dog, viper, vampire-&#xD;
bat or tiger ; but I do affirm that the monads, which now&#xD;
constitute their souls, once sustained a very close rela-&#xD;
tionship to the beasts of the field, and have not yet got&#xD;
rid of the effects of the alliance. This is a matter too&#xD;
clear to be disputed : else, .why these very remarkable&#xD;
resemblances?  I know, that some people will "pooh!&#xD;
pooh !" at this idea ; but that wont 'account for' the&#xD;
likeness! A man never was a dog, or An owl; yet, that&#xD;
both dogs and owls were originally made, in order that&#xD;
the human monad, in passing a sort of gestation period&#xD;
in them, might be ripened slowly, and prepared for what&#xD;
he is now, I have at present no manner of doubt  In-&#xD;

other and higher forms, to which the Winged Globe,&#xD;
Man, has transmigrated in its passage from minus to&#xD;
plus-from bad to better, and from better to best. A&#xD;
dog, owl, bat or human body is only so much matter-;&#xD;
and the sole business of 'matter' is to furnish so many&#xD;
different sorts of huts, houses, and palaces for spirit-&#xD;
ual tenants, wherein the primary schools may be attended&#xD;
by the regal student-soul. I know tlhat even the disen-&#xD;
thralled spiritual body is itself but a mere vehicle of&#xD;
Soul, on its next upward - transmigration-is still but,&#xD;
an adjunct, an out-prQjection of, and scarcely second-&#xD;
cousin to, the tremendous mystery-Soul-the Winged'&#xD;
Globe within it. We know that man can live withou-t his&#xD;
carbonaceous body, which is but an incidental assump-&#xD;

less than a century; that this period is scarce one sec-&#xD;

It is an axiom that whatever has one end, must also&#xD;
* Many persons desire to know how to produce and cultivate clair-&#xD;
voyance. To such I present the following rules, knowing them to be&#xD;
efficient, and only requiring patience for success. 1st, Set apart the&#xD;
first hour after retiring to bed nightly., Eat a light supper ; bind a&#xD;
light silk bandage over the entire forehead and eyes, turn the face to-&#xD;
ward the darkest corner of the room, and endeavor to s'ee. 2d, Never&#xD;
call on a spirit to assist you. 3d, Keep the skin pure by daily ablu-&#xD;
tions. 4th, Learn to concentrate the mind on a single object, and&#xD;
keep it there. 5th, Fix it on something good, useful and true. 6th,&#xD;
Pray fervently to God. 7th, Ask a mental question, and desire that&#xD;
the symbolic answer may be given. 8th, Wish well to everything and -&#xD;
everybody.=&#xD;
The results will be--1st, You will see a dim haze. 2d, A spark of&#xD;
light. 3d, Agreater light. 4th, Misty forms will float before you.&#xD;
5th, They will grow distinct. 6th, Answers will flow into your mind.&#xD;
7th, You will gradually merge into a radiant light ; behold the actual&#xD;
dead, converse with them, and realize your soul's desire.&#xD;
&#xD;
have another ; now, if a human soul has its first begin-&#xD;
ning here, nothing is more certain than that it will have&#xD;
an end somewhere. But the soul is mind-mind is God&#xD;
and God is eternal. He ever existed, and ever will;&#xD;
and the monads, the germ-souls here developed, and&#xD;
hereafter perfected, are also eternal; they existed in all&#xD;
times past, and can never cease to be, for their very&#xD;
nature is Permanency. All bodies here, or elsewhere,&#xD;
are but accompaniments-instruments, tools of the royal&#xD;
spirit in one or more of its multitudinous phases of ex-&#xD;
istence-that is to say, it creates, uses, and puts them&#xD;
on to serve its purposes, till it can afford to dispense&#xD;
with them : for human existence is a synonym of Eter-&#xD;
nal Duration--is an immense circle : a circle is but an&#xD;
infinite polygon: and bodily vehicles serve the. soul's&#xD;
purposes during its passage over a very few of the,&#xD;
straightlines whereof this polygon is composed. And,&#xD;
beyond all doubt, the period will arrive-it may be&#xD;
away in the far-off eternities-but nevertheless will&#xD;
arrive, wherein the soul will dispense with all these&#xD;
characteristics of its juvenility. No one associates legs,&#xD;
arms, eyes, stomach, or sexual organs, with the idea of&#xD;
God: why then should such things be eternally-predi-&#xD;
' cated of man, who is. fashioned after the model of the&#xD;
Infinite God Himself?&#xD;
The body' of a man is a greater thing than any object&#xD;
on earth beside; is.far greater than even the physical&#xD;
world in which he lives, because it is the master pro-&#xD;
duction of all the elements and forces in that world.&#xD;
The spiritual form that man assumes, and to which he&#xD;
may be said to transmigrate after the physical decease,.&#xD;
is of far more importance, and altogether, greater than&#xD;
is his previous physical and material "structure. A&#xD;

these ; and only God himself can embrace all at one&#xD;

path, I rejoice ; I rejoice in the presence of such a fact,&#xD;
and fold her as a sister folds another to her soul.&#xD;
People are false to the light within them. It is a&#xD;
great thing to be ,true to self-to stand forth the cham-&#xD;
pion of your noblest thought, when all fingers point at&#xD;
you with scorn, all heels are upraised to crush the sweet&#xD;
life out of you, and when only God and your own stout&#xD;
heart are on your side. To do this,-and, thank&#xD;
Heaven ! some there be who dare it,-is to be more&#xD;
than human: is to be divine ; and this heart-wrought&#xD;
divinity allies us. to the immortal gods. This it is that&#xD;
I call virtue.&#xD;

&#xD;
As previously stated, it was not possible for me to&#xD;
understand the nature of the mysterious power ,ly&#xD;
which, in company of the peerless being, 'hotmor, I&#xD;
volitionless clove the ambient air. "0, it was a pro-&#xD;
jection of your soul," says the modern novitiate.of the&#xD;
mystic school. Not so, friend ; for the Ego. then and&#xD;
- there ascending, under the influence of a power similar&#xD;
in kind, but immensely superior in volume and-display&#xD;
to itself, was not a mere psychical phasma-a thing of&#xD;
appearance only, and possessing no substantiality of its&#xD;
own ; it was no flimsy projection from the fancy-fa-&#xD;
culty ; was not a meaningless substance-void image of&#xD;
myself. It was no mere subjective state objectified,&#xD;
but was indeed my very self, wearing the body of im-&#xD;
mortality for a time, during which certain lessons must&#xD;
be and were learned, fully and practically, demon&#xD;
stratively and perfectly, so far as the lessons went.&#xD;
The man himself, and not his mere shadow or ghost was&#xD;
there, in proper form and essence, to the end, no doubt,&#xD;
that the mysteries there learned might be given, as&#xD;
they now practically are, to the world of thinkers.&#xD;
As I, or rather we, ascended toward the zenith; it be-&#xD;
gan to rain ; but this did not incommode us, nor in any&#xD;
way hinder the ascent, which was continued until it be-&#xD;
came necessary to penetrate a dense region of thick,&#xD;
black convolving cloud that was now rolling up in vast&#xD;
and heavy masses from °the northern verge of the im-&#xD;
mense horizon, driven by the fierce breath of a mighty&#xD;
blast. Looking earthward, it seemed as if the deep&#xD;
black night was suddenly going down the wind howled&#xD;

through- the buildings, and the trees shook, as if with&#xD;
mortal fright and terror ; the sorrowing clouds shed&#xD;
great drops of tears, as if mourning in comfortless grief&#xD;
over poor human frailty, while the soughing and the&#xD;
sighing of the sea was a fitting sympathium to their for-&#xD;
lornness and despair.&#xD;
Thicker rolled the dense black pall over the face of&#xD;
the vaulted heaven, hiding all its glories, and shrouding&#xD;
it in the very folds of gloom, whose density was only&#xD;
relieved when the broad glare of the lightnings rushed&#xD;
out upon the sky. The sheets of flame were of various&#xD;
colors-violet, green, white, red and purple. The three&#xD;
former appeared to issue from the earth's surface ; the&#xD;
others, from the space above and immediately around&#xD;
- us. There were occasionally lines of purely white fire,&#xD;
and these took the form of chains, every link of which&#xD;
carried ten thousand deaths along with it. These came&#xD;
singly ; and sometimes two separate lines of fire would&#xD;
leap out from the bosom of the clouds simultaneously,&#xD;
but from opposite quarters of the gloom-in which case&#xD;
they appeared to meet in anger, like as if two angry&#xD;
gods were warring with each other, and their junction&#xD;
was instantaneously followed by the most terrific bursts&#xD;
of thunder that ever fell on human hearing since the&#xD;
mighty worlds were made.&#xD;
I shook with mortal terror ; and this terror increased K&#xD;
and intensified into positive, almost unendurable agony,&#xD;
as crash after crash of horrible roaring, rolling, burst-&#xD;
ing god-cannonry swept down the vast concave, drown-&#xD;
ing the clangor of the mad winds, which were rushing&#xD;
and rumbling through the spaces, striving desperately&#xD;
to rival and surpass the awful voice of the electric god&#xD;
himself. I felt that I was lost ; and in that moment of&#xD;
&#xD;
anguish, from the deeps of my soul there went forth a&#xD;
prayer to Him whose presence and majesty was then&#xD;
recognized, with heart bowed down, and with a fervency&#xD;
never realized before. I feared to be swept into no-&#xD;
thingness by the tempestuous breath of heaven ; I feared&#xD;
to be hurled into destruction by the driving blast! But&#xD;
no ; for seemingly the wind passed through me, just as&#xD;
the electric current passes through human or any' other&#xD;
material bodies, and touched me not destroyingly. The&#xD;
fiercest wind that ever raged can never blow a shadow&#xD;
from its place, neither can it in any way blow -away a&#xD;
spirit ! for the reason, amongst others, that spirit is not&#xD;
matter, any more than is a shadow or a sound substan-&#xD;
tial, as this last word is generally defined ; hence wind,&#xD;
which is a material substance, can in no wise touch it.&#xD;
And so I was not blown avay before the driving gale.&#xD;
"But suppose a column of wind, just three yards&#xD;
square, and moving at the rate of two hundred miles an&#xD;
hour, sweeps toward the very spot on which a human&#xD;
spirit 'stands, or is ; it cannot turn this wind aside&#xD;
How, then, could anything remain unmoved ?" This is&#xD;
the question ; now the answer comes. A bar or column&#xD;
of sunshine streams through the air, and its volume is'&#xD;
just three yards square. It will require something far&#xD;
different, and much more powerful than a column of air,&#xD;
moving at the rate of two hundred miles an hour, to&#xD;
blow away that sunshine, or to drive a hole through it;&#xD;
yet the sunshine would still be there, and so would the&#xD;
windI This is my answer to that objection. I lifted&#xD;
up my soul in unspeakable thankfulness and adoration,&#xD;
as I realized that spirit was superior to matter, even in&#xD;
its most subtle and rarified forms-superior even to the&#xD;
glaring, seething, melting, white fire of the clouds, when&#xD;

&#xD;
the lightning furnaces overflow with fervent heat !&#xD;
Safely, slowly, majestically and holily we passed&#xD;
through this terrible battle-ground of the elements ; and&#xD;
to a question internally framed and put,' this answer&#xD;
was given by the illustrious being at my side:&#xD;
"That you might practically realize the indestructi-&#xD;
ble nature of the human being; that something of hu-&#xD;
man majesty might appear to your understanding ; that&#xD;
you might be shown somewhat of the dignity of being,&#xD;
and the royalty of things, elements, laws and principles,&#xD;
hast thou been_ by me brought hither. This is merely&#xD;
a first lesson-the mere Alpha of knowledge ; but others&#xD;
far more important are yet to follow. Fear not V"&#xD;
But this last injunction it was utterly impossible for&#xD;
me-and would have been for any human being under&#xD;
similar or analogous cireumstances-to obey or do ;&#xD;
for what with the dizzy sense of height, the sensations&#xD;
attendant upon the movement through space, the glare&#xD;
of the ~lightning, the elemental strife, the perfect ob-&#xD;
scuration of my dwelling place (the earth), together&#xD;
with an indefinable. dread of a something impending,&#xD;
and which I might never be able to comprehend ; this,&#xD;
'all this, had the effect of almost palsying every faculty&#xD;
of being, and blanched my very soul with fear; for the&#xD;
rush and crush, the horrible din of the tempest, and the&#xD;
thunder, made terror my constant associate. It was as&#xD;
if the trial hour had come ; it was like the breaking up&#xD;
of mighty mountains ; it was as if a hungry earthquake&#xD;
were feeding on a world ! Instinctively I looked to&#xD;
Thotmor for protection. He smiled at my weakness,&#xD;
and bade me remember that a greater than himself was&#xD;
present. Yes, I realized then that God was there, and&#xD;
I was safe ; for He smiled between His frowns, and&#xD;
&#xD;

whispered " I AM HERE !"  *   *   *  *   In other&#xD;
days, when I gave my soul and body up to the guidance&#xD;
and control of invisible beings, whom I did not know,&#xD;
whom I did not stop to prove and identify-apocryphal&#xD;
persons, at the best-persons disembodied, if indeed&#xD;
they ,ever wore clay upon this footstool-beings who&#xD;
seek their own amusement at the expense of human&#xD;
dupes-beings who take supreme pleasure and delight&#xD;
in the exhibition of human weakness-beings who&#xD;
silently, but surely, infuse the most deadly and destruc-&#xD;
tive venom, in the shape of philosophic assurances-&#xD;
beings who mock at our calamity and laugh when our&#xD;
troubles come, both of which they themselves bring to&#xD;
pass-beings who persuade people to believe in all sorts&#xD;
of inanities, dictate senseless platitudes, and encourage&#xD;
persons to believe themselves philosophers when they&#xD;
are only-fools ! I repeat, when in other days I yielded&#xD;
to this evil influence-in other days, when both God&#xD;
and Thotmor were practically ignored aiid forgotten-&#xD;
in other days, when the pride and power of Eloquence&#xD;
turned me from the USEFUL-an eloquence weird and&#xD;
almost magic, that welled up through my soul and went&#xD;
forth from eye, and tongue, and.pen, and drew my soul&#xD;
from God,-there came occasional twinges of regret,&#xD;
and an assurance that, in forgetting to profit by the&#xD;
teachings of that afternoon, I had bartered off priceless&#xD;
joys for the empty bauble 'worldly fame and ephemeral&#xD;
glory '-that for the hollow music of man's praises and a&#xD;
few claps of the hand, I had given up the Key to the&#xD;
magnificent Temple, one of whose apartments I that&#xD;
afternoon entered for the first time. Great God ! how&#xD;
I have suffered for that- foolish estrayal-that fearful&#xD;

&#xD;
We rose above the fierce turmoil, and for the first&#xD;
time a fair opportunity was presented for a loser scru-&#xD;
tiny of my guide. As I drew nearer to him, he said-&#xD;
not in words, but in the silent language used by the&#xD;
higher citizens of the Republic of Souls-" All thoughts&#xD;
have shape : some are sharp, acute and angular, many-&#xD;
pointed, and exceedingly rough. These cut and bore&#xD;
their way through the worlds ; others are flat aad disk-&#xD;
like :'these are thoughts that must be incarnated in&#xD;
matter ere they become useful; their mission is to be&#xD;
SEEN ; others to befelt. Some thoughts are light and&#xD;
fantastic, like bubbles on the sea ; they are beautiful&#xD;
while the sun shines, but the very ray that reveals their&#xD;
beauty also seals their doom-for the heat kills them ;&#xD;
they burst, and forever disappear, being hollow and of&#xD;
but little substance : other thoughts are round, heavy,&#xD;
and solid °as a cannon-ball, and like them, too, their&#xD;
mission is to batter down the mounds erected by un-&#xD;
wise men. Words are but the garments of thought.&#xD;
Geometry is the Soul of all Sciences-order, symmetry,'&#xD;
and form! Everything, line, point, shape, angle and&#xD;
figure, corresponds to something in both the Spirit and&#xD;
the Soul-world (the outward and inward Soul-life), and&#xD;
are, independent of magnitude, absolute and arbitrary&#xD;
symbols, embodying an absolute and fixed principle:&#xD;
and every line, dot, point, shape or angle has a fixed&#xD;
definition in the lexicon of the Starry Heavens.* All&#xD;

For, if this statement be founded in truth, of which there can be but&#xD;
little if any doubt, what ages must elapse ere we be fully able to read&#xD;

metry and beauty, can only be outwardly conveyed or&#xD;
expressed ; if by the voice, by harmony, music and ryth-&#xD;
mical speech and sound ; if by the pen or type, only in&#xD;
characters themselves geometrically perfect, and harmo-&#xD;
niously so.&#xD;
"Now," said Thotmor, " you have seen much--heard&#xD;
much. I have just given you a key, and to prove your&#xD;
proficiency in learning, I propound a question. It is&#xD;
this : What thinkest thou of Nature ?"&#xD;
Now I, to whom this was addressed, could not pre-&#xD;
cisely comprehend what he meant by 'Nature;' but&#xD;
naturally supposed that reference was had to the ele-&#xD;
mental disturbances and the fearful exhibition of mate-&#xD;
rial energy we were witnessing, and which was at that&#xD;
moment unabated in the least ; for the storm still raged&#xD;
with as much fury as ever-not over the same portion&#xD;
of the earth, it is true, but in its own track, as it moved&#xD;
on its southward march. I, therefore, answered in the&#xD;
same silent language, "that, in view of all that had just&#xD;
been witnessed, it was evident that an overruling power&#xD;
existed, ever wakeful, ever on the watch ; that His&#xD;
power was exercised for the greatest good of all the&#xD;
creatures of his love.; and that God worked mysteri-&#xD;
ously through nature, expressly to effect the good of&#xD;
human kind." To this general answer he responded:&#xD;
"Right : but what think you of Nature ?"&#xD;
Here was a repetition of the identical question al-&#xD;
ready propounded. It caused me to ponder a little&#xD;
more deeply, and after a while, thinking that this time&#xD;
he was perfectly understood, I replied : "It seems to&#xD;
me that what we call 'Nature' is simply God in action;&#xD;
and that God in the sublimer sense is Deity in repose."&#xD;
"Apt learner," said he, "right again. But wht&#xD;

thinkest thou. of Nature ?" Now here was the same&#xD;
interrogation a third time repeated. I now determined&#xD;
to study well ere venturing to. reply. This I did, ARli&#xD;
the while upborne on the air by a force whose nature&#xD;
was not easily understood, but which I inwardly resolved&#xD;
to. igyestigate and explore. The resolution was, as will&#xD;
bp.hereafter seen, most faithfully kept, with results&#xD;
highly gratifying and. satisfactory, which will, be, pr&amp;amp;e&#xD;

While delving in the mines of my soul for a proper&#xD;

upward, at an angle of fifty-one degrees with the. hor-&#xD;
izo'. 'The storm: was going in. one direction, and we&#xD;
in.the other; so that in a. little time we. were entirely&#xD;
beyond its influence, as was. also that portion of the&#xD;
eath over which it first began. to rage. There was no&#xD;
standard by which the rate of our velocity could be&#xD;
msgsuged ; but it must have been prodigious,.judging&#xD;
by. the rapidity with which the. mountains, rivers and&#xD;
citie. of the, earth seemingly swept by us-for indeed.&#xD;
/ there was at this point of the experience but very little,&#xD;
if any, sense of motion,-no cutting of the air,-no&#xD;
hiding as we passed through it ; but it seemed as if we&#xD;
were in, the center of a large transparent globe, or&#xD;
sphoer;; which: itself moved on as if impelled by a force&#xD;
entirely superior to that which governs. rude matter.&#xD;
The earth itself, from, the elevation we were at, seemed&#xD;
to have. lost its. general convex shape, and now looked&#xD;
as if it. were a huge basin, so, singularly did' it appear&#xD;
tocqcaye itself. Instinctively I realized that this was&#xD;
the appearance it would naturally assume to a person.&#xD;

no TRUE RoSICRUCIAN dares shrink from attempting&#xD;
the .solution of the mysteries and problems that human&#xD;
minds in heaven or on earth may conceive or propound.&#xD;
Our motto-the motto of the great order of which I&#xD;
was a brother on the earth,-an order which has, under&#xD;

through me to the world. How wonderfully! How my&#xD;

This was my resolve ; how it was afterward forgotten&#xD;
has already been stated. Men ever neglect and forget&#xD;
their best friends'! But even this forgetfulness, so I have&#xD;
been told, was foreseen ; it was known long years ago&#xD;

To resume : In reply, I said: "Yes, you are, this&#xD;

the methods of Socrates, because' they are best calcu-&#xD;
lated for the purposes of teaching ; and these methods&#xD;
are"-" Wisdom's,-and were applied practically by the&#xD;
great teacher," said he, interrupting the sentence, and'&#xD;
completing it for me, but not quite as I had intended.&#xD;
"Now, scholar, answer the first question, and tell me&#xD;
what you think of Nature ?"&#xD;
" I think that Nature is an emanation from the Glo-&#xD;

those who Try, and trying for a time, at length become&#xD;
victors and enter in. Man fails because of feeble, sleep-&#xD;
ing, idle Will-succeeds, because he wakes it up and ever&#xD;
keeps it wakeful!I"&#xD;
In an instant I turned to find whence these spoken&#xD;
words proceeded ; and a sight- of ..rare, surpassing&#xD;
beauty, such as ravished every sense of -my inner being,&#xD;
fell upon my gaze. A female of regal aspect floated on&#xD;
beside the form of Thotmor ; her radiant mien, beauty&#xD;
Qf form, loveliness of expression, and the grace of her&#xD;
every movement, were such that the language we apply&#xD;
to embodied woman can never convey an adequate idea&#xD;
of the peerless Queen before me. It was from her lips&#xD;
that the spoken words had come.&#xD;
As I gazed inl utter bewilderment upon the houri,&#xD;
Thotmor smiled, and said.:&#xD;
"This is Cynthia, whose sun-I am ; my moon she is:&#xD;
she is mine-I am hers-WE ARE ONE! On earth her&#xD;
body sleeps ; here her soul is awake, and tuned to the&#xD;
melodies of Heaven. We are working for the World,&#xD;
and in that work find pleasure and excellent joy ; but&#xD;
we only reached the bliss by Trying. Do thou the&#xD;
same, and tell thy earthly brothers to do likewise 1"&#xD;
Thus recalled to mental effort, I strove to conquer&#xD;
my admiration for the woman, and address myself to&#xD;
thought ; albeit the task was very difficult.&#xD;
We are human beings still, whether in or out of the&#xD;
body ; and the same surmises, guesses and yonderments&#xD;
possess us, wheresoever we are. Thus, I could hardly&#xD;
help envying the Egyptian his glorious prize, nor won-&#xD;
dering if he did not see much trouble and come to deep&#xD;
grief on her account. Certain it is, that no man on&#xD;
earth could rest quiet with such a treasure of beauty&#xD;

under hip care; and it struck ie that, even in the Soul-&#xD;
world, all people could not be free from all the human&#xD;
passions, as we know them here below ; and that jeal-&#xD;
ousy might disturb the Oriental's peace of mind, I could&#xD;
scarcely doubt.&#xD;
He saw my ruiind ; and, turning to the full moon of&#xD;
beauty who clung to his side, said to her, " Answer for&#xD;
me !" She did so, and said : "urity is the soul of&#xD;
Beauty, Symmetry is its spirit, and Justice is its body.'&#xD;
Every human being, in the Soul-worlds or elsewhere,&#xD;
loves nothing so well as to be well thought of by all&#xD;
other humaui beings. Ambition, Emulation, and Per-&#xD;
sonal Joy are the three bars, which constitute'the pivot&#xD;
of all human character. The bad passions, as envy,&#xD;
strife, anger, last, and revenge, on earth, not only de-&#xD;
stroy the body, but also mar the spirit. Every one of&#xD;
these, and all other evil things, thoughts or deeds, in-&#xD;
evitably leave their marks upon the soul, and deep, sad&#xD;
marks they are.&#xD;
" The law of Truth, the law of Individuality, and the&#xD;
law of .Distinctness, (by means of which the man is&#xD;
rounded out into a perfect character, and is afterwards&#xD;
kept for all eternity totally distinct from any other&#xD;
being in all the universe), reign in the Soul-world ; nor&#xD;
can they ever be broken or evaded ;-consequently,&#xD;
there can be no mistakes in regard to Identity. *Cyu-&#xD;
thia is Cynthia, Thotmor is Thotmor, Clarinda is Cla-&#xD;
rinda, and John is John-and all must remain so till&#xD;
the end of the Ages. It is so now, whatever it may have&#xD;
been in the ages wherein the angels fell.&#xD;
" On earth, the real thoughts and sentiments of a soul&#xD;
are hidden beneath the garniture of language and as-&#xD;
sumption ;-not so here in the Soul-world, where every&#xD;

one must appear to be what he really is at the moment.&#xD;
There are no disguises ; and while any one can do&#xD;
wrongly, if they so elect, yet they cannot intend wrong&#xD;
and pretend right, for the presence of an evil thought&#xD;
in the soul, is immediately marked upon its surface--&#xD;
upon its features, by a law of that very soul itself ; and&#xD;
these marks and distortions are so very plains and un-&#xD;
mistakable, that all Heaven can read them at a glance ;&#xD;
and such instantly gravitate to the Middle State.&#xD;
"Self-preservation, therefore, and self-respect keep&#xD;
Heaven clear of sin !&#xD;
"In the second place, it is well known here, as it&#xD;
ought to be on earth, that the deceiver is, in all cases,&#xD;
the deceived; the wrong-doer wrongs himself more than&#xD;
any one else ; and the unhappiness a person may cause&#xD;
another to feel, must be expiated by the causer, not by&#xD;
the victim! This is a safeguard against jealousy here.&#xD;
No one will do an ill deed if he is aware that it cannot&#xD;
be kept secret, even for a moment.&#xD;
" In the next place, I chose Thotmor, and he me, be-&#xD;
cause of all the inhabitants of this starry land, he suited&#xD;
me the best, and I him ; wherefore, there is a stronger&#xD;
attachment between us than there possibly could be be-&#xD;
tween either and any other individual in the great Do-&#xD;
main. All Heaven knows this fact also: hence, no one&#xD;
in Heaven would attempt to sunder a natural tie, be-&#xD;
cause they are well aware, that, even if that were pos-&#xD;
sible, misery, and not contentment, must be the inevita-&#xD;
ble result. Wherefore none in Heaven would attempt&#xD;
such a thing, and no one from other regions could essay&#xD;
it."&#xD;

For a moment, I remained pensive and silent ; and&#xD;

his Cynthia, who floated on beside him  -his pearly arm&#xD;
engirdliirfg her glorious form in an embrace, which spoke&#xD;
of something higher and holier t'n we mortals call&#xD;

nant questions, that must arise in the mind of the read-&#xD;

this section, a short one, shall be devoted to that end.&#xD;
As I rose in the air, and pag4ed over a sunny region,&#xD;

which had not felt the effects of the terrific storm of thun-&#xD;
der and rain, there came a feeling, that there was a vast&#xD;
difference between my then present state, and that in&#xD;
which the'aerial journey from the city in the East was&#xD;
accomplished. In both eases, the altitude reached was&#xD;
probably the same, or approximately so ; but in the first&#xD;
flight I was not one-fiftieth part as conscious, or awake,&#xD;
as during the second: there was also a difference in the&#xD;
rapidity of motion.&#xD;
The individual calling himself Thotmor, and concern-&#xD;
ing whose reality I am perfectly convinced, now moved&#xD;
through the air at but a slight elevation above me ;&#xD;
wJhile formerly, I had not seen him at all, previous to&#xD;
making his acquaintance near the house of the sleepy&#xD;
student.&#xD;
At one time, among my other miseries, there pos-&#xD;
sessed me a very uncomfortable apprehension, lest, by&#xD;
some mishap, my guide should be unable to sustain me,&#xD;
and that I should fall. Now the reader will say, "That&#xD;
was impossible; for a spirit, being lighter than air,&#xD;
must necessarily ascend." Another one will say, "True,&#xD;
so it must; but being so very much lighter than air,&#xD;
what is to hinder it from going up with a rush-what&#xD;
prevents it from going up vertically with the speed of a&#xD;
rifle ball, seeing that the pressure of air must force it&#xD;
upward with a power almost inconceivable? How is it&#xD;
that a spirit gets to earth at all, seeing that light bodies&#xD;
caznn? displace heavy ones; and how could a spirit move&#xD;
off at an angle at all ?"&#xD;
These, and a multitude of other questions were pre-&#xD;
sent in my mind, along with many novel suggestions,&#xD;
provoked by the peculiar circumstances in which the&#xD;
narrator of the experiences was placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WJTI TIHE DEAt.       229&#xD;
&#xD;
Let us try to make the matter clear, by remarking,&#xD;
in the first place, that the prevailing sensation was such&#xD;
as is experienced by those who go up 'into the great,&#xD;
deep in balloons, during their novitiate in the business&#xD;
of cloud-clidbing.&#xD;
Among other questions that arose, and which I put&#xD;
to myself, was this : "lDe I as -a spirit, forthe timie&#xD;
being, actually ascend? Am I really here, on the breast&#xD;
of earth's great cushion-the atmosphere ? or is all this&#xD;
an experience of the soul-an episode of dream-life?&#xD;
Am I really here, or is this, that so resembles me, only&#xD;
an alter ego-a second self-the result of a pushing forth&#xD;
of faculty? Is it a mere phantom, which my soul has&#xD;
shaped, and sent forth, and then lodged its intelligence&#xD;
in, for a time, by way of experiment and freak ? If so;&#xD;
how is it done?&#xD;
"In either case, the question is a grave one; for if it&#xD;
be not myself, here in the air, but only a soul-created&#xD;
phasma, of what sort of, materials is this appearance&#xD;
made, and whence comes the wierd and mighty power&#xD;
that can call these images into being, and endow them&#xD;
with all the resemblance of reality ?"&#xD;
These and similar queries suggested themselves to&#xD;
me; and while the last one was still fresh in my mind,&#xD;
I notidied that the earth beneath me was -smiling in&#xD;
glad freshness ;--for the storm had not passed over that&#xD;
part of the land, although even then and there it was&#xD;
raining-a soft, gentle, sweet and sunshiny summer&#xD;
rain, such as happens when the "Devil whips his wife "&#xD;
--I beg pardon--used to whip her ; for, according to&#xD;
modern philosophers, of the " Harmonial " order, he&#xD;
has deceased these eleven years, and, of course, cannot&#xD;
thus chastise her any more. Be that as it may, how-&#xD;

&#xD;
ever, it was raining; and here was an opportunity to&#xD;
solve a much mooted point, namely : "Do spiritual&#xD;
beings get wet "in a rain storm.? Do the rain-drops&#xD;
and hail-stones pass through them, or do they bound off&#xD;
as from a solid body ?" Most attentively did I make&#xD;
the closest observations, in order to be able to solve&#xD;
the question. I decided that the rain passed through us,&#xD;
yet touched us not at all, as apparently did the wind.&#xD;
Preferring to make every point as clear as possible, I&#xD;
shall attempt to illustrate this one, even at the risk of&#xD;
a little prolixity and repetition. The subject is an in-&#xD;
teresting one, and demands it.&#xD;
Now, everybody knows that nothing less dense than&#xD;
water, %ave air, in violent motion, will turn aside or&#xD;
shed it; and that which constitutes the spiritual body&#xD;
is, of course, infinitely finer and more subtle than even&#xD;
the rarest gas,. much less the thick and heavy atmo-&#xD;
sphere surrounding this and all other globes.&#xD;
This .fact being conceded, it follows that all such&#xD;
bodies must be pervious; and they are so, and not so at&#xD;
the same time. Remember that spirit is not soul ; for-&#xD;
get not that the latter is the Winged Globe,,of which I&#xD;
have spoken, and the former is a projection, an out-&#xD;
creation from it. This out-projection or spirit is, of&#xD;
course, perfectly atomless and unparticled. We gaze&#xD;
into a mirror,,and behold a semblance of ourselves ;&#xD;
and the same figure may be gazed at by a hundred thou-&#xD;
sand eyes; everybody will at once acknowledge that&#xD;
the likeness is perfect and real, yet every one knows&#xD;
that not one single atom of any sort of matter enters&#xD;
into its composition.&#xD;
It cannot be handled, but everybody can see it ; nor&#xD;
would a pistol ball, shot through the head of that&#xD;
&#xD;
figure, harm it in the least .degree, because it is not&#xD;
substance, although it is substantial. It is not a sha-&#xD;
dow, for it is real,-which latter fact is proved daily by&#xD;
those who first coax this image to enter a camera, and&#xD;
no sooner does it get fairly in than the clever artist&#xD;
impales it against a tablet of glass, or ivory, and lo!&#xD;
everybody carries the chained image to his home for&#xD;
everybody else to look at, who chooses so to do. This&#xD;
is Photography.&#xD;
Now      wind and rain, cold and heat, are as power-&#xD;
less an ine cient to act upon a spirit as they are upon&#xD;
the image i the camera, or a mirror. In other words,&#xD;
the spiritual body is a projected image of the soul,--is&#xD;
a sort of objectified subjective state ; or is a, fixed idea&#xD;
-an out-creation.*&#xD;
The image in the glass is not made np of parts,-it is&#xD;
a unit,-an entity,-is homogeneous. " If so, how can.&#xD;
it be scientifically true that the rain passes through it?&#xD;
If it does so pass, it must make holes through it; and&#xD;
if holes are made through it, then its homogeneity is at&#xD;
an end for evermore."&#xD;
This is a fair, as it certainly is the strongest object-&#xD;
ion that can be urged against the position assumed.&#xD;
But the answer, which forever sets it at rest, is this:&#xD;
"Spirit is not matter."&#xD;
The subject may be further illustrated, thus: Suppose&#xD;
a large sheet of flame issuing, not from a jet, but from&#xD;
the edge of a hollow disk, and that the rush of gas is&#xD;
great enough to impel the sheet of flame six feet into the&#xD;
air. Now, try to wet this flame ; it will take some time&#xD;
before you succeed in the enterprise. .Take .a watering&#xD;

&#xD;
pot and sprinkle it to your heart's content; but, although&#xD;
the drops of water will reach the ground through the&#xD;
disk, and displace portions thereof, for an infinitesimal&#xD;
space of time, yet they will neither wet nor touch it.&#xD;
Every drop of water has an envelope of an electric&#xD;
nature, doubtless; and that each particle of flame has&#xD;
a corresponding one is self-evident. The respective&#xD;
envelopes *nay come in contact with each other; but&#xD;
their respective principles-never.&#xD;
Now, the spirit is far more difficult to reach than&#xD;
would be this flame. As'stated 'before, every perfect&#xD;
thing is globular : the sun, within the brain, I have&#xD;
called by its true name-a winged globe; the electric&#xD;
moon, whose seat is in, on and about the solar plexus,"&#xD;
is literally an electric moon, perfectly globular. The&#xD;
human being, body, soul, spirit, is surrounded by an at-&#xD;
mosphere of the same form, or nearly so ; and this&#xD;
enveloping aura, this spirit-garb, protects its centre-&#xD;
the man-from   injury or contact with other things&#xD;
(unless, indeed, it be voluntarily broken down, or yields&#xD;
to assaults from without by the abjectivity of the will).&#xD;
True, a person may be injured magnetically through&#xD;
this sphere, by pressure or malaria, although itself&#xD;
remains unruptured and intact ; just as a pistol ball&#xD;
will kill a man, without actually touching his flesh. If&#xD;
he chance to be dressed in silk, it may drive its bulk&#xD;
into his' flesh, yet not a particle of lead shall touch it.&#xD;
I observed the aura or sphere which surrounded&#xD;
myself and my two glorified companions. The rain-&#xD;
drops passed through it, as.also through portions of ourt&#xD;
respective persons, just as they wpuld through a sheet&#xD;
of flame-lightning, but without actual contact or wet-&#xD;
ting either. We have every reason to believe that, as&#xD;
&#xD;
we ascend, the air grows colder, until at the height of&#xD;
forty-five miles the cold must be in the neighborhood of&#xD;
three thousand degrees below zero. Now, spirits fre-&#xD;
quently pass through this--they'must pass through it to&#xD;
reach us, yet they are unaffected thereby, for the reason&#xD;
that they are superior to all material influences.&#xD;
Moses, .Elias, the spiritual visitants of the Patriarchs,&#xD;
of the man of Uz, he whom John saw,-and others, had&#xD;
to come through this intense cold; and the fact that they&#xD;
did. so proves that material forces have but little, if&#xD;
6o y effect upon spirit. It therefore defies one extreme,&#xD;
and consequently ought the other. It does so. For&#xD;
the spirits seen walking about in the fiery furnace,&#xD;
which was heated seven times hotter than its wort, for&#xD;
the especial grilling of Messieurs Shadrach, Meshach&#xD;
and Abednego, bade defiance to fire ;--a fatal fact&#xD;
against the theory of a physical hell-the spirits proving&#xD;
not only water, ice, and wind, butfire-proof also !&#xD;
Continuing my scrutiny, I observed that never a drop&#xD;
of rain fell upon the centre of the heads of either of the&#xD;
aerial party : for just over the crown of every human&#xD;
being in the body is a thick bone; out of the body, a mag-&#xD;
netic shield, impenetrable by anything whatever ; for&#xD;
every'drop of rain slides off it, as from an iron roof.&#xD;
Place a spirit under a stream of falling water, and the&#xD;
central globe would instantly condense to infinitesimal&#xD;
proportions, so firmly embraced by 'its shield as to&#xD;
resemble the original monad ; nor could water ever&#xD;
come in contact with it, any more than the same water&#xD;
could come in contact with a plate of iron at a white&#xD;
heat, which every one liows is a physical impossibility,&#xD;
I humbly trust that I have been understood.&#xD;

Electrically. It projects an image of itself to where it&#xD;
would be ;-every man who thinks of a distant point&#xD;
does the 'same, only that the 'thing cannot be seen with&#xD;
earthly eyes. There is a magnetic railway between the&#xD;
projection and the projector, along which this latter&#xD;
moves.&#xD;
Throw forth an image by glasses across the street.,&#xD;
It will find no difficulty in reaching lhe spot whither&#xD;
you send it. Analogous to this is the power of soul to&#xD;
go whither it listeth, unimpeded, and of its own 'free&#xD;
will.&#xD;
The ultimatum of all philosophy is, 'to teach men how&#xD;
to live ; to instruct them how to die; -establish a con-&#xD;
viction of immortality ; and explain how this latter is,&#xD;
and why, and to whither it shall lead. The sole busi-&#xD;
ness of this book, and that which is to follow in due&#xD;
season, is not to controvert any current system of phi-&#xD;
losophy-Harmonial, Spiritualistic, or otherwise--'but to&#xD;
present, not a mere theory or hypothesis on the subject&#xD;
of an hereafter and. its sequences; but to give forth&#xD;
what I know to be the truth, so far as that truth ex-&#xD;
tends ; nor do I fail to be impressed with a deep assur-&#xD;
ance that, although much herein given necessarily an-&#xD;
tagonizes a few of the popular Spiritual theories, yet&#xD;
I believe that that which I have now given concerning&#xD;
the soul and its destiny, is perfectly true and correct.&#xD;
I care not how much soever the reader may doubt the&#xD;
aerial experiences herein narrated-for these are but&#xD;
illustrative, at best, and 'in other respects are of little&#xD;
account-yet the Theory I knowdo be the only true one&#xD;
yet advanced; and it is to the principles wherein this&#xD;
&#xD;
theory is founded, that I call the attention of the Think.&#xD;
ing World, and challenge its respect.&#xD;
Not a human being, whom I ever saw,:was fully satis-&#xD;
fied with either Modern Spiritualism, or what is called&#xD;
Harmonial Philosophy; for the more a man -bases his&#xD;
hopes of a life hereafter upon either of them, the more&#xD;
he stands on slippery ;ground. Doubt after doubt seizes&#xD;
on the mind, until at Blast people turn away, sad-hearted&#xD;
and 'desperate, from  so-called systems of Immortalism,&#xD;
to take refuge in the church, which;erewhile they so&#xD;
loudly berated and condemned-resort once again to&#xD;
the Blessed Book, or else unhappily drift out upon the&#xD;
shoreless, hopeless sea. of atheism. There are untold&#xD;
multitudes who will gladly hail anything that promises&#xD;
to remove the dreadful doubts concerning, not only&#xD;
their continued&amp;amp;existence, but their chances of bliss be-&#xD;
yond the veil. To such this book and its fellow comes;&#xD;
for the benefit of such they 'both are, and are to be sent&#xD;
forth upon the world's great tide.&#xD;
Thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the truths here&#xD;
written-with the principles set forth and running like&#xD;
a gold-vein through that portion which is descriptive&#xD;
mainly-no one can help feeling strong in the certitude&#xD;
of an' hereafter-this being the only attempt :ever yet&#xD;
made in this country to treat of the soul per se, and in&#xD;
its higher and deeper relations, so far as the writer is&#xD;
aware.&#xD;
Concerning the absolute -origin and final destiny of&#xD;
the soul itself, the answer to the question, What is God,&#xD;
and a few others of equal import, the reader must wait&#xD;
for the second volume ; for, in the present, we have only&#xD;

DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
SoUL. Herein we are only at the top of one of the less-&#xD;
er hills, from which we catch a faint, very faint view,&#xD;
and hear but the distant. throbbing pulses of the vast&#xD;
ocean, on whose swelling bosom, and upborne by whose&#xD;
wisdom-crested waves all men shall ere long sail.&#xD;
As true lovers of our race, we ask all good people to&#xD;
embark with us anon upon an intellectual voyage across&#xD;
the Dee, in search of facts and truths far more stately&#xD;
and sublime than those usually purporting to come from&#xD;
super-mundane sources.&#xD;
All truths are necessarily dogmatic ; nor has any&#xD;
attempt herein been made to hinder their expression&#xD;
from being the same.' Our.great Master and Exemplar&#xD;
in virtue was dogmatic-why not his, followers be the&#xD;
same ?&#xD;
It seems essential, at this point, that the writer should&#xD;
say something, not concerning the spiritual realms, but&#xD;
of the man-spirit-the self-the developed and develop-&#xD;
ing monad. Now, what is a monad ?   The reply is:&#xD;
Something quite analogous to, but not exactly, the Leib-&#xD;
nitziau 'Particle,' but that which is to universal spirit&#xD;
precisely what an atom is to universal substance or&#xD;
matter-with' this difference : you cannot cut an idea&#xD;
into halves or pieces, for it is, was, and ever will be, a&#xD;
unit ; so is a monad.&#xD;
An atom of matter is divisible to infinity-a single&#xD;
grain of sand being, by a mental process, capable of-&#xD;
disintegration so great, that were each portion to be&#xD;
separated from its fellow by only the millionth. of an&#xD;
inch, yet the vast concave of the dome, the walls of the&#xD;
sidereal heaven, the awful height and depths of space,&#xD;
timdizzy steeps of the great Profound, would not afford&#xD;
room to hold them all, even though the worlds were&#xD;

&#xD;
rushed out of being for accommodation's sake. Yet-&#xD;
not one of these portions would be spirit, because that&#xD;
is indivisible ; they can never be. It is a philosophic&#xD;
truth, as well as a scientific axiom, that "Matter is&#xD;
divisible forever ; spirit is not."&#xD;
Beasts have spirits, but not immortal ones ; for the&#xD;
reason that they are the result of mere physical energy,&#xD;
and natural elements acted on by natural forces: Their&#xD;
mission is to serve certain uses, the greatest of Which is&#xD;
that of affording, in some mysterious way, temporary&#xD;
homes for higher beings, or rather for what is there-&#xD;
after to become such-as already alluded to in the ar-&#xD;
ticle on Transmigration.&#xD;
Nothing material is endowed with perpetuity ; for&#xD;
nothing particled can ever be so. True it is, that the&#xD;
spirit of a beast is many degrees finer in texture, and&#xD;
more sublimated than the luminiferous ether by which we&#xD;
come in contact with colors ; but the soul of a man is&#xD;
myriads of degrees more subtile in constitution than even&#xD;
this essential part of animals. The last is particled, the&#xD;
former homogeneous, sui generis, Deific in origin, pecu-&#xD;

genesis, but, like trees of the forest, there are vast dif-&#xD;
ferences between them. Men often speak of "full souls,&#xD;
big souls, weak souls, strong souls, lean and fat souls,"&#xD;
and so on-thus leaping to a truth by a single bound&#xD;
of intuition. For no greater truths exist than those&#xD;
words convey. People grow weary by labor, that's&#xD;
physical exhaustion ; and of pleasure, that's sen-&#xD;
sational weariness ; and of thinking, hoping, cogitating&#xD;
on a single subject, that's soul-tiredness--for all of&#xD;
which rest is demanded, or rather a change of attention&#xD;
and occupation.&#xD;
, The body is a laboratory, wherein the most beautiful&#xD;
and useful chemical labors are carried on ; and it ex-&#xD;
tracts and distils the finest essences from all things it&#xD;
manipulates. True it is, that a coarse man will only&#xD;
extract physical energy from beef and wine ; but it is&#xD;
also true that these things contain something far more&#xD;
rare, and so subtle that it requires a stomach of finer&#xD;
texture and more elevated order to extract the higher&#xD;
essences, that go to inspire genius, develope poets, and&#xD;
sustain philosophers in thinking.&#xD;
Some persons manufacture bleaching salts and oil of&#xD;
vitriol ; others compound the delicate odors which float&#xD;
upon the air of palaces, and radiate from the garments&#xD;
of refined women ; yet both are chemists. And so of&#xD;
human bodies ; they feed on the essences of food, and&#xD;
convert these essences into the most spiritual forms pos-&#xD;
sible ; this last is duly laid away in numberless maga-&#xD;
zines, or store-houses, which we call the " Nervous Gan-&#xD;
glia." When these stores are distributed, the body&#xD;
grows strong. When the supply is exhausted, we be-&#xD;
come faint and weary, and finally fall asleep, whereupon&#xD;
the soul-sun sets for a while (vide the case of the stu-&#xD;

And ! we sleep.    At other times, without arousing&#xD;
the body; he soul cautiously re-ascends its daily throne,&#xD;
takes ad   ntage of the physical quiescence and slum-&#xD;
ber, and   ays many a fantastic trick with the mate-&#xD;

that of iti phantasmal comrades and lookers on, who&#xD;
do not fail to gather round the bedside &amp;amp;    join the&#xD;
spectra  sport&#xD;
Sonietimes it overhauls the sheets of memory, sport-&#xD;
ively, racily, jocundly, mixes them all together, puts&#xD;
incongruous events alongside of bitter remembrances ;&#xD;
takes a character here, and one there, and forces theme&#xD;
to perform  the most ridiculous and     absurd  dramas&#xD;
imaginable; nor does imagination itself escape, for the&#xD;
soul touches it, and forthwith it produces, like a fecund&#xD;
mother, and the night-born offspring are forced to mingle&#xD;
themselves in one indescribable medley, along with.&#xD;
thin.gsof pure memory and, reminiscence, thus forming&#xD;
an o    podrida without order, system, head, foot, be-&#xD;
ginning or end.   We are dreaming 1*&#xD;
* An objection may be urged here, to. the effect that animals&#xD;
dream, as well as human beings, Dogs bark in their sleep, aid ma i&#xD;
feat all the phenomena 6f dreaming. Has the dog, therefore, got agg&#xD;
that pernoctates, goes abroad, and soforthi? To this I reply : It is by&#xD;
no.teans certain that the sleep-barking of dogs and other beasts is&#xD;
anythingmore or less than a merely physical, nervous agitation. I am&#xD;
not sure that they really do have dreams. Still, on this point I am&#xD;
&#xD;
At other times, having placed proper sentinel to&#xD;
guard the body and telegraph to itself arpthee t ap-&#xD;
peajance of danger, the royal soul, feeling its- bg born&#xD;
nature demanding a supply not to be found          thin&#xD;
itself always, leaves.for a while the scene of its. so'ourn,&#xD;
and leaps upward to the starry vault, to hold.   verse&#xD;
with the stars and their holy tenants : The    have&#xD;
visions !&#xD;
Again, it takes journeys over the earth      surface,&#xD;
visits old, familiar, or new and unknown place  persons&#xD;
and things: Then we are clairvoyant.&#xD;
These are moods and phases of the soul's existence&#xD;
and activities, but they are not the highest ,. for, at&#xD;
still other tiines, it arrays itself in its most regd garb,&#xD;
and, marshaled by an army itself has called into being,&#xD;
solemnly marches forth to attend THE CoUNCIL OF m&#xD;
Houns!--and here a holy awe steals over me, as this&#xD;
trait and power of the soul is revealed. At such times&#xD;
we PROPHECY and become familiar with events,persons,&#xD;
principles, and things yet unborn in time and space ;-&#xD;
we have receded behind the wall. of conscionsness, and&#xD;
bathed for a time in the sea of mystery, everybillow&#xD;
and wavelet of which constitutes\ 4 destiny. For that&#xD;
all things that are yet to be, at'this moment exist as&#xD;
monads and uncarnated thoughts in the Mind of Mits,&#xD;
there cannot be a shadow of doubt     nether can there&#xD;
open to conviction, and just as soon as any rell-breddog, not one.of&#xD;
your mongrel hounds either, shall tell me ,what he dreamed, I will an&#xD;
notune that highly interesting fact to the world; but until one shall&#xD;

man  .  free-acting being.&#xD;
Bye~nd-bye the sleep is ended, and we return to&#xD;
outer, ery-day life. The soul's magazines have been&#xD;
stored fl of the needful energies, both for itself and&#xD;
body;     .it can at will, and sometimes by the action&#xD;
of a po   r lying- back of volition, send forth these&#xD;
fiery ele  ts ,to warm up and invigorate the outer&#xD;
self, as o asion may demand. Thus comes the blush&#xD;
of love, tho inspiration of song, and acting, the fire and.&#xD;
energy 'f speech and oratory, the flames of lust and&#xD;
passion the brutal vigor of the-athlete anlpugilist, the&#xD;
blazerff .anger, and the sudden and awful courage and&#xD;
ferocity of those who, at other times, are poltroons and&#xD;
errant cowards.&#xD;
Of course, some people accumulate more of this fire&#xD;
than others, and some are more sensitive to its action-&#xD;
even when it is quiescent-than less fine organizations&#xD;
possibly could be ; .and these very sensitive persons&#xD;
will, from the effect this accumulated power has upon&#xD;
them, tell you more of an individual's character from a&#xD;
half hour's associatioir, than others could after a dozen&#xD;
years of intimacy, for they come in almost direct rap-&#xD;
port with the soul itself, with something of which the&#xD;
"sphere" is charged ; whereas those who are not so&#xD;
sensitive must base their verdict on what they see and&#xD;
hear.-the others, on what they feel and know..&#xD;
Thisfact is beginning to be well known ; but there is&#xD;
a consideration arising out of it of vast importance. It&#xD;
is this : Those who are most sensitive are the very ones&#xD;
who absorb deepest of those energies. They draw it in&#xD;

like sponges, and give it out the same, as may be 4ily&#xD;

she draws from the audience, and returns lik '.vse,-&#xD;
with something added from herself. Such p   ns, sit-&#xD;

tives will so absorb the sphere of persons With whom,&#xD;
they may chance to be, that they may be led to o many&#xD;
a naughty thing, even against their own incations&#xD;
and judgment ;-especially is this - true with rerence&#xD;
to, the tender passion. ~Their conduct may be very+&#xD;
reprehensible, their hearts be very pure. Of course:&#xD;
this condition is a morbid one, and should be sternly&#xD;
fought against and battled down.&#xD;
The question is often asked, "Do. spirits eat ?"&#xD;
Answer: In the Middle States, eating is a strong phan-&#xD;
tasy; the inhabitants believe they eat. In the Soul-&#xD;
world. stomachs are useless, as, well as the organs of&#xD;
sex, but the soul absorbs nutriment spontaneously.&#xD;
There is no waste!1&#xD;
Having thus briefly replied to the objections likely to&#xD;
be raised, I now resume the narrative at the point&#xD;
where it was left incomplete. What further took place&#xD;
will be found in the next section.&#xD;
A the splendid sentences of Thotmor, recorded in&#xD;
a previous section, fell upon the hearing of my soul, that&#xD;

went 4 from the soul's deepest profound a desire to&#xD;
know 4owhat, and where was this supreme Ruler of&#xD;

w Scarcely was this thought fairly formed, when a deep&#xD;
slumber  ntly but rapidly stole over me. How long it&#xD;
continued_'I know not, but when consciousness for a&#xD;
moment turned 'again, I found myself brushing the&#xD;
dust fro  my apparel, beneath the trees from which&#xD;
my firs journey had commenced. This occupation&#xD;
could; not have lasted more than a minute, when'I&#xD;
stated off. -mechanically toward a deeper nook, and&#xD;
more secluded spot among the trees and bushes, appa-&#xD;
rently guided by instinct; or directed by a power above&#xD;
myself. And I lay me down, as if wearied with undue&#xD;
physical labor, and soon a gentle buzzing sound, like&#xD;
unto that made by.myriad insects when the Day-God&#xD;
hies him to his slumber, and all the great, big world is&#xD;
still, lulled me into a sweet and soft repose. And a deep&#xD;
sleep fell upon my eyelids ; and in that strange, mys-&#xD;
terious rest, I experienced that which was not all a&#xD;
dream.' I hasten to present the result of this last dis-&#xD;
play of power.&#xD;
LIGHTLY, as floats the atom on a sunbeam, swiftly as&#xD;
the bird flies, gaily as a laughing child, a spiritual&#xD;
form sailed stilly through the SPACE. Beneath it rolled&#xD;

silvery seas ; above it twinkled the starry leld of&#xD;
Heaven ; and afar off, on either hand, great sun&amp;amp; looked&#xD;
out to see the moving panoply.&#xD;
And still the soul sped on; until,at last, it earthly&#xD;
home was in the distance, and all around t  mighty&#xD;
,Silence reigned. And still the so il swept on  Ld  No&#xD;
dizziness, no faltering, from the awful sense :f height,&#xD;
alarmed it; no fear beset its bounding, joyus, happy&#xD;
heart. That soul was not my own, for they ason that&#xD;
no man can possibly predicate ownership of  soul-the&#xD;

speak of, and say, "-my body, limbs, faculties, ualities,"&#xD;
and so forth, with correctness and propriety ;.or these&#xD;
are his incidents, but soul is himself-that of wh h these&#xD;
incidents obtain. They are, to coin a word, t  out-&#xD;
sphering of the inner being: the soul was me.&#xD;
In a little while, the question, " What, and why is&#xD;
this ? and whither am I going ?" rose in my mind. A&#xD;
silvery voice breathed silently into my spirit this re-&#xD;
sponse:;" Whoso truly willeth to know, shall know, by rea&#xD;

Theoice was that of the fair being, whom Thotmor&#xD;

at that instantt a clearness of perception, power of con-&#xD;

such as I never knew before. I asked mentally, how&#xD;
this came about, and the answer came to my understand..&#xD;
ing, through the channel of a cl6ar intuition, and shaped&#xD;
itself in the following form, as nearly as words will&#xD;
hold it.&#xD;
"Theearth is coarse, yet imprisons the refined. It is&#xD;
a dense, gross substance, a heavy rough body, but it has&#xD;
a soul. The soul of the world is spirit. Every atom&#xD;
of matter has a moving, living, active, spiritual centre. -&#xD;

mogen ous: old as -Deity, young as the new-born in-&#xD;
fant; ways existed, ever will exist. They are Pha-&#xD;
souls (by-souls,).or Monads.&#xD;
I nowK ealized this strange truth : that the consciQus&#xD;
soul thaconstituted me was now beyond, as it were, all&#xD;
the circn }volving material. atmospheres surrounding&#xD;
earth, a4.i that it was rapidly approaching the awful&#xD;
and vast piritual Ocean. Presently it ceased .its.&#xD;
flight, tur  l earthward,-and made the following dis-&#xD;
covery: fir't, the SPIRITUAL pervaded the Ethylic Sea:&#xD;
this, in turi the Etherial ; that, the Magnetimic; that,&#xD;
in turn, Eltrimic ; that, the Magnetic ; that, the Elec-&#xD;
tric ; and  at, in turn; the Earth Sphere, or 'O dylic'&#xD;
emanati, which in turn pervades the atmospheric or&#xD;
Oxygnc; so that man really breathes several, instead&#xD;
of a igle atmosphere-the highest of which quickens&#xD;
spirit, as thie lower does the body.&#xD;
Turning the ,gaze outward, a fine, glorious, soft, sil-&#xD;
very sea was seen spreading,, away in all directions ;&#xD;
and the eye had no difficulty in traversing space, as on&#xD;
earth it has, through the corporeal structure and the&#xD;
several earth-airs. In this: clear expanse of Spirit floats&#xD;
uncounted globular monads, infinite in number, infini-&#xD;
tesimal in volume ; they are each enveloped in a fine&#xD;
electric substance, which surrounds=them perfectly. The&#xD;
spiritual waves bear them on its bosom to the earth ;&#xD;
they, by a mysteriotis power, are drawn to the human&#xD;
male brain, through the lungs-; they enter it, become&#xD;
lodged, remain till ascertain physical work is completed,&#xD;
and then descend and effect their mission through the&#xD;
aid of the prostate gland. At certain times, they quit&#xD;
this, pass into the uterus, enveloped in the prostatic&#xD;

aere, in these aerial Kingdoms, beyond the d ain of&#xD;
matter and the sphere of what we call Nature,  rNatu-&#xD;
ral Law, which of course does not govern Spir it hav-&#xD;
ing a mode of-its own, I found two sorts of  nads-&#xD;
the one perfectly globular, which constitute  he germ&#xD;
6f the man-the others ovoidal, which constitutes the&#xD;
germ of the female. .There are always two together: in&#xD;
couples they come from the Eternal God,'n couples&#xD;
they return.&#xD;
Placed in the uterus, these come in lovit relations&#xD;
with a subtile spirit originally in the fem e monad,&#xD;
-subsequently energized in the woman, conden d in the&#xD;
'ova,' and there is a blending of elements--th  exter-&#xD;
nal of the monad, and the internal of the ova ; an  om&#xD;
this blending springs a third something, which isnehe&#xD;
nucleus of the nervous body, so to' speak. This nucleus&#xD;
robs all earthly things of their vital life-plants, flow-'&#xD;
ers, food, drink, and so on-through the instrumental-&#xD;
ity of all the bodily organs. This union produces an,&#xD;
improvement in both ; together, they attract the great&#xD;
spiritual substance or atmosphere pervading our air,&#xD;
and then the child is quickened, and rises in the pelvis ;&#xD;
the very instant that the first spark of this great spir-&#xD;
itual atmosphere passes into the babe, the monad in-&#xD;
creases in bulk, bursts its bonds or envelopes, passes&#xD;
from the foetal lungs to its brain, locates in the pineal&#xD;
gland, radiates through the corpus collossum, energizes&#xD;
its body, and, lo! a soul hfas entered upon a new career.&#xD;

As 4id before, the soul grows'-grows in two ways:&#xD;
first, b development-unfolding and awakening ; sec-&#xD;
ond, b required knowledge and experience. The lat-&#xD;
ter is o nd .for the earth, the former is of and for the&#xD;
soul itse  The.one .epends on circumstance and acci-&#xD;
dent, thli other is above and beyond both; There may&#xD;
never be  uch of the latter, but the- former will, must&#xD;
go on to Inity. Both may go on to a great extent on&#xD;
earth; one ertainly will in the Hereafter.&#xD;
All these things I felt, I saw, and knew, as I floated&#xD;
there on th" shores of the Spiritual Kingdoms.&#xD;
Have yo ever beheld the golden rain of a rocket, on&#xD;
a stillys ner night? You have ? Well, just so God&#xD;
rains mo da from Himself ! Spirit is the emanation&#xD;
from G's body! Monads are corruscations from His&#xD;
Soul VaThese truths can never be demonstrated; all&#xD;
s Wtfual truth is- real, ands demonstration is effective&#xD;
ly in reference to fleeting appearances. The logical&#xD;
aculty deals with what pertains to us on earth ; that&#xD;
which pertains to the Spiritual, requires some higher&#xD;
powerof the: soul. .It has it-in the Intuitions. The&#xD;
logical faculty deals with Progress'; Intuition with De-&#xD;
velopment-unfolding : organic the one--central-soul&#xD;
the other.' Intuition will one day substantiate my dis-&#xD;
coveries-when I am dead, and this writing is a cen-&#xD;
tury old.&#xD;
At present there is really no Spiritual Philosophy at&#xD;
all-scarcely an approximation thereto: We have: not&#xD;
even a spiritual nomenclature, and -it is exceedingly&#xD;
difficult to convey spiritual fats or ideas in terms no-&#xD;
toriously adapitd only to the expression. of transitory&#xD;
earthly knowledge.&#xD;

to be correctly understood. The English is t  tongue&#xD;
of commerce-has too much ring of the dollar uit-to&#xD;
be used to express spiritual things. I shall  to con-&#xD;
vey my experiences so as to be understood  yet how&#xD;
can.I hope to be ?-hoe make the fact k   wn, that&#xD;
one human sou is actually larger, deeper, water, than&#xD;
this whole material globe ? -that:it has' sun, within&#xD;
the cerebrum ; a moon, the solar plexus that its sun&#xD;
rises (when we wake), and sets, retires to he vertebral&#xD;
column,. sinks within the great ganglio  behind the&#xD;

villi ; planets, the ganglia ; it has a milky w , the great&#xD;
nervous cord ; comets, and, in. short,' ever thing that&#xD;
the outer world has, and much beside.. H   shall I&#xD;
express these facts so as to be understood? for the&#xD;
terms I use do not convey the -exact meaning.  ho&#xD;
can understand that the soul has hills, mountains,'v&#xD;
leys, and so -forth? Yet it hath all these things in a&#xD;
higher and heavenly sense. Still; more difficult will it&#xD;
be to prove or show that the Bible saying, that "the&#xD;
kingdom of heaven is within" every one, is a literal&#xD;
truth. The soul, per se, contains within itself the sum&#xD;
total of a dozen universes, each differing from the other,&#xD;
each one overlying' that beneath it; and just as fast as&#xD;
the soul outgrows, unfolds from, or 'vastates' either of&#xD;
these, new and higher ones become apparent, just as&#xD;
there dwells an appreciation of the refined and beauties&#xD;
ful in every coarse man or woman ; but, in order that&#xD;
this esthetic sense shall comre out and be active, a cer-&#xD;
tain discipline is essential, the result of which is a vas-&#xD;
tation and throwing off of What impeded end obstructed&#xD;

cation o discipline. Our principal life-for we lead&#xD;
several Jtthe same time, is the life of Imagination..&#xD;
We form, 'n fact create, by a mystic power not yet un-&#xD;
derstood,  hole galleries of paintings, figures, adven-&#xD;
tures and  ircumstances, 'houses in Spain,' 'castles-in&#xD;
the air.'  these are our in-creations, because, while yet&#xD;
in the bod hey loom up in the deep, distant depths of&#xD;
the mind, a images more or less vague and shadowy.&#xD;
They are as et within us, pictured, as they are, upon&#xD;
the outer spaces of the soul, yet within the radius of&#xD;
the spirit.&#xD;
After death, these become the realities of our then&#xD;
existence, a'e the spontaneous out-births or out-crea-&#xD;
tions of ou souls, and in them we live, move, and have&#xD;
our bei    happy, joyous, pleasant, provided our souls&#xD;
are bea iful, calm, and serene; but if they be not so,&#xD;
the d4se out-creations'are full of horrors-serpents,&#xD;
soine things, reptiles and dead men's bones.&#xD;
Few, very few clairvoyants have ever beheld the reali-&#xD;
ties of the spiritual world. I know of but few, contem-&#xD;
poraneous or historical, ,whom I believe to have ever&#xD;
beheld the mysteries of the pther life. Amongst the&#xD;
few, Behmen, Swedenborg, and Harris stand pre-emi-&#xD;
nent. The others-some of them honest, doubtless, but.&#xD;
often deluded-have beheld their own out-creations, or&#xD;
the spiritual photographs on the sky-surfaces of things&#xD;
and events pertaining to the earth.. Every out-creation&#xD;
differs from all-others; hence arises the annoying dis-&#xD;
crepancies and diverse accounts of the same things,&#xD;
which we are constantly:receiving-as,'for ,instance,-the&#xD;
spirit-land, the sun, moon, planets, and their occupants,.&#xD;
as given by various-so-called modern seers. The mem-&#xD;
ory of mazi is internal to himself while here, but after&#xD;

death it is, as it were, the furniture of the parlor Where-&#xD;
in he lives on the other side of time ; and these jbleau-&#xD;
vivants, or living pictures, when seen by clai oyants,&#xD;
are passed off upon men as the revelation. of ealities,&#xD;
when they are but the ephemera of existence - Spirits&#xD;
tell us of their legs, lungs, bodies, lands, par ), and so&#xD;
forth,-and of their gardens, houses, trees, ests, and&#xD;
the- like. All this is very well, and are s  itual facts&#xD;
to them, yet are but the out-creations of the+ human soul,&#xD;
which really has no legs, arms, and so.forth, ecause the&#xD;
soul is MIND, and can have no possible uefor. these&#xD;
things; yet, for a long period, these ver  things are&#xD;
realities to the spirit and to clairvoyants.&#xD;
The fact is, good spirits do not appear o  -tenth as&#xD;
often as imagined'; the majority of spiritua  appear-&#xD;
*ances'-are but out-creations-subjective imageof the&#xD;
seer, objectified-else are psychological project 11of&#xD;
other minds-images impressed upon the susceptibh&#xD;
person's brain.&#xD;
The spiritual world, as it is generally mapped out to&#xD;
us, appears but a few degrees in advance of this one,&#xD;
on the same general plane, if we are to believe the tales&#xD;
told us concerning it ; while the -fact is, that world' is&#xD;
not like this in any respect. It is not a place, literally&#xD;
speaking, but is a ecndition-a single one of thousands&#xD;
that have been-of millionsfyet to be. Dream-life is a&#xD;
good illustration of my"meaning. It is a condition of&#xD;
the soul. In it, we have a life actual, real, absolute;&#xD;
not in far-off regions, because we are still in our bed-&#xD;
rooms; but in the midst of our own private domain,&#xD;
our own out-creations, our personal universe,&#xD;
The human soul, as said before, is a divine kaleides-&#xD;
cope, which forever changes, yet never exhausts its ca-&#xD;

.I. .&#xD;
parity therfor change, or for appreciation for the bliss&#xD;
thence  derived, or of trouble encountered. So we have&#xD;
no need .f legs in the spirit-world, because our move-&#xD;
ments ar not with reference to- space--we have done&#xD;
with roa  and distances there-; but our changes are of&#xD;
state or c ndition. Illustration: Anna is a beautiful&#xD;
girl--pioi good, pure, excellent sits beside her lover&#xD;
John-a p&amp;amp; shed scoundrel in every sense. One bullet&#xD;
kills both,, instantly. They die on the spot. Both&#xD;
awake in t. other life-in the same room, yet are a&#xD;
million mii apart, because their respective mental&#xD;
states deter ne their relation to eachother there, albeit&#xD;
other thing determine it here.&#xD;
They i y never not only not meet again, but never&#xD;
know au   t of each other, so vast is the real distance&#xD;
(condin) between the twain. The spiritual world of&#xD;
the will abound with forms of beauty, use, goodness:&#xD;
'ti aof the other will abound with toads, swamps,&#xD;
snakes, bugs and unseemly things.  Why ?-because&#xD;
each is surrounded with his or her personal out-crea-&#xD;
tions. Each conrnunicating back to earth, will tell&#xD;
what each beholds; both will be true, yet both fail, to&#xD;
give even the ghost of a real notion about the absolute&#xD;
supernal world. Whatever we are, we see;- whatever&#xD;
we w-ant, is there before us-we have, Thus we can&#xD;
ascend in goodness, or sink away to 'the' very depths of&#xD;
hell-both our own,however. * *  *-* And all these&#xD;
things came to nie there, as I floated on a wave of the.&#xD;
sea of knowledge.&#xD;
Self-induced psycho-vision often passes as the product&#xD;
of spirits. the line is yet to be drawn between the&#xD;
Aseem   and the real in this respect. Spirits first are&#xD;
monads-spiritual (psychal) atonis-God-existent 'from&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.          257&#xD;
all past eternity : Secondly, they are awakened-beings,&#xD;
self-existent to all future states-not times merely:&#xD;
Thirdly, at physical birth they, as monads, cease to be ;&#xD;
a' physical death a change as complete and gr  t as the&#xD;
last occurs. And now they have passed thr ugh, and&#xD;
across three eternities ; that of monads, mjter, and&#xD;
spirit ; and fourthly, they remain in no condilon above&#xD;
a century (which accounts for the fact th44t no well-&#xD;
authenticated instance of intercourse with spirit over&#xD;
a century dead, has yet been recordedl) ; lastly, they&#xD;
ever pass onward, and each condition diffes from the&#xD;
last, as does sleep from wakefulness. There are mil-&#xD;
lions of these changes. It takes about a century to&#xD;
graduate and gravitate from one condition-  another.&#xD;
When we pass from this world, we take so  ; things&#xD;
with us which we are obliged to unlearn there. ,Thus,&#xD;
some want drink, others rest, fruit, land, houses, money,&#xD;
and so forth ; some want children and desire to cohabit,&#xD;
as on earth. All have just what they want ; only that&#xD;
the children begotten there, are mere phasmas-just as&#xD;
by a powerful effort we can create a beautiful puppy&#xD;
dog, and hold it as 'an ideal before our eyes while here.&#xD;
A crazy man's golden crown and throne, although to&#xD;
us nothing but straw and bits of stone, are to him gold&#xD;
and diamonds ; and flash forth the richest scintillations&#xD;
of the most precious jewels. It is a state of the mind.&#xD;
Millions of crazy people inhabit both worlds; whence&#xD;
it follows that insanity is a disease of the mind, as well&#xD;
as a result of organic and chemical change and dis-&#xD;
turbance in the body.&#xD;
It is hard to describe spiritual things in material&#xD;
language. Amongst all the flood of ".Spiritual litera-&#xD;

as sucp is far more ideal and material than spiritual,&#xD;
and are ,eferable, as to their origin, to- excited ideality,&#xD;
and -oth4 peculiar mental states, rather than to the&#xD;
Superna vorld. Amidst the three million speeches a&#xD;
year, del ered under professedspirit influence, it is my&#xD;
deliberat$onviction, that not Aver ten in one thousand&#xD;

ate in the Iiddle-states of the spiritual world; very&#xD;
many of th vivid and beautiful descriptions of spirit&#xD;
life, scenery nd so forth, which so please us t'o hear, are&#xD;
transcripts 00m the individuals' inner-self, or rather of&#xD;
the out-cre tions thereof. Of course, these are true&#xD;
to the individual, but to no one else : let it be once&#xD;
remembered that the man is as immortal in the past,-as&#xD;
he is n\w, and will be ; and that during that state (as&#xD;
M1-OgA  or Pha-soul) of pre-carnate being, he had an expe-&#xD;
rince as real to him then, as his present is to him now;&#xD;
and we shall no longer marvel at genius, or at the stu-&#xD;
pendous powers of the human mind. - During the sub-&#xD;
lime experiences of my soul, which I am endeavor-&#xD;
ing to recount, I became thoroughly satisfied, not as&#xD;
the medium, not from spiritual teaching, but from soul-&#xD;
observation, that man, like God, had no beginning, as&#xD;
did matter as w~e know' it---aud that like Him, he will&#xD;
never positively have an end ; albeit the modes of God,&#xD;
and those of, man---for at bottom, they. are ONE, contin-&#xD;

tion, "What is God ?"  *  *   *  *  Up there,t upon&#xD;

Eternal4 Secret, the awful, yet radiant MYSTERY, is as&#xD;
far beyoj d the Ideal Jehovah, as is the human beyond&#xD;
the anali. Let us make a chain : Matter is the first&#xD;
link : Sprit is the second-I speak of UNIVERSES nOW,&#xD;
remember Soul-that which constitutes the Human&#xD;
THINK-pri iple, is the third ; well, this, OVER-SOUL&#xD;
flows through all these, as man's spirit through his&#xD;
body. - Now man is conscious only partly ; he knows&#xD;
nothing just n the other side of himself, is ignorant of&#xD;
what life is, aid of that august power which governs h is&#xD;
involuntary golf. Well, the OVER-SOUL fl vs-out into&#xD;
the All-into the universe of ,THINK, (I can use no&#xD;
other term,) to that of Soul, MONADS, Spirit, Matter;*&#xD;
and while pervading and being imminent in ALL, is'&#xD;
self-consci  at every point; in the THINK, the MONAD&#xD;
the Soul the Spirit, the Matter, in every particle that Is,&#xD;
or ca -fever BE. I hold this, as the truest definition of&#xD;
then,""eity yet given ; and in the radiant presence of&#xD;
such a thought, all human things must bow ; all human&#xD;
pride stand back, all human ideas pale and fade. * *&#xD;
And these things came to me, and I believe them true.&#xD;
And God is not good, but beyond it ; is got truth, but&#xD;
its foundation ; is not power, nor Life, nor THINK, but&#xD;
beypad, beneath, above all these ! Spirit may be repre-&#xD;
sented- as the soul of matter : Soul as the inmost of&#xD;
Spirit ; Monad as the base of Soul;- THINK, as the&#xD;
essence of Monad; God as the SoUL OF THINK. Here,&#xD;
let no man smile at these uncouth expressions; they&#xD;
 stand as symbols of mighty truths. I have said that&#xD;
Monads were scintillations from God's brain: They&#xD;
are: That Matter was THE PROCEEDING from his body.&#xD;
Monads are forms of thought, and are the bubbles on&#xD;
His ever-rising tide of SOUL. Hence, these monads&#xD;
&#xD;
DEALINGS WITH THE DEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
261&#xD;
&#xD;
are, so to speak, the giving of of his spirit.God's&#xD;
Spirit is the element, Soul ; but of THIS Soul, done but&#xD;
Himself knoweth.&#xD;
And as I floated there on the sea of knoiiedge, an&#xD;
impulse sprung up to know more ; and' these.questions,&#xD;
were fashioned in my soul, and that soul de  ed from&#xD;
out the mystery the answers appended to eal question:&#xD;
" Is not man forever in the human form ?' In human&#xD;
form, YES ; in human shape, no : Man wsas once the&#xD;
monad-a finite sun. He still is so as tohimself (see&#xD;
a previous section), and the body which he uses is but&#xD;
an out-creation, as are his mental pictures; with the&#xD;
difference that the latter are volitional andcircumstan-&#xD;
tial, while the former is constitutional. The shape,-&#xD;
organic, is the very best adapted to the poses it&#xD;
serves, and it is the effect of a force lying behi the&#xD;
personal consciousness. Its use is for the material.t&#xD;
could have none in the spiritual world, save as the&#xD;
effect of Soul-habit; or as a means of discipline in the&#xD;
lesser or "lower" departments or conditions thereof.&#xD;
"How of dead infants ?" Infants have spiritual bodies,&#xD;
and retain them till discipline places them beyond the&#xD;
necessity. In all cases, the bodily forms are attach-&#xD;
ments to the human, so long as the human is in the&#xD;
sphere of discipline,-hence moves within the possibili-&#xD;
ties of Good and Evil. When they leave this latter,&#xD;
and merge into the sphere of USEs, the external of the&#xD;
soul corresponds to its new state. A soul is imma-&#xD;
terial, as of the nature of THINK,-hence needs no&#xD;
stomach to digest food, lungsto breathe air, legs for&#xD;
locomotion, and so forth ; for all these are principles of&#xD;
the soul, with mere out-created organs. =When it needs&#xD;

the organs no longer,~it dispenses. therewith, but the,&#xD;
princip  underlying them still remain,&#xD;
"Unhurt amid the rush of warring elements,&#xD;
,te wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds."&#xD;
A. man  its in his study, and thinks of his father's:&#xD;
house, m     many miles -away. He sees it ;-well,&#xD;
brook, barn, trees, garden, flowers,-all, all just as&#xD;
they really ,xist. Now, the man's body, being a mere&#xD;
thing of circa instance, still remains in the study, but the&#xD;
man himself is gone ; his body and spirit are in the&#xD;
room, but hii self is at the old homestead. Space; time,&#xD;
and flight !re not to the soul,-only to forms and&#xD;
things of coarser nature and lesser majesty.&#xD;
The   &amp;amp;1 thinks "I am   there," and--there it is.&#xD;
Certain persons, gifted, can see things spiritual ; all&#xD;
perfoiscan at times, and frequently are sensible of the&#xD;
presence'of others, whose bodies are far away. They&#xD;
are made sensible of it by soul-contact. 'It is possible&#xD;
for a man to project an image of himself to any dis-&#xD;
tande, which image shall be mistaken for himself.'&#xD;
These images, being such,.of course, cannot speak when&#xD;
questioned: by whoever sees them. Whoever 'can pic-&#xD;
ture the exact simulacrum of himself, can will this&#xD;
figure whither soever he may choose, and then persons&#xD;
who behold this declare they have seen his. "spectre,"&#xD;
" phantom," "ghost," "wraith," or "double."  Again,&#xD;
the man of strong will and. pure desires may quit the&#xD;
body:spiritually, actually, and 'be perceptible to. others&#xD;
at a distance,; may be spoken: to,. hold conversations,;&#xD;
and move material objects, when his body lies seores of&#xD;
leagues away.&#xD;

jected out-creations from  the wicked self. si  are&#xD;
the fiends, snakes, toads, devils and horrid 1# asters&#xD;

order, but beautiful, instead of the reverse,;re the&#xD;
angels, ghillim, houris, fairy-forms, peris .n aiads,&#xD;

especially of the Orient, when inspired by dPium, love,&#xD;
and religion ;, out-creations of their inmost iouls,-sub-&#xD;
jective images objectified.. This species of out-projec-&#xD;
tion pertains to all -persons, while under thediscipline&#xD;
of good and evil, virtue and vice, and all other material&#xD;
conditions and accidents. "What do yo" mean by&#xD;
virtue and vice, as material incidents ?"  I mean that&#xD;
good and evil are but conditions environing many while&#xD;
under the sway of his inevitable discipline.&#xD;
There is such-a thing as the spirit of Co unity. A.&#xD;
mob is a fearful thing, a dreadful power, and it developes&#xD;
a ferocity which does not inhere-in any one of the multi-&#xD;
tude composing it-a material energy of awfl: force.&#xD;
A- reasoner can take aside, one by one,. an entire&#xD;
audience, and convince them thus, of the justice of the&#xD;
cause he advocates ; but, let them be, combined, and he&#xD;
shall not be able to convince the general sense, nor sne.&#xD;
ceed in evoking aught but derisive sneers at his "imbe-&#xD;
}cility." Or conversely : he may:not be able-to convince&#xD;
the people,. taken singly, yet, let him pour out his. soul&#xD;
before them, congregated,ar,4he shall sway themas the.&#xD;
tempest sways the forest-material=energy in both eases.&#xD;
Again: vice. is frequently not, considered in. the at&#xD;
itself, but in the how' society views it. Thus, adultery,&#xD;

This personal feeling is Common- Sense. The other&#xD;
is Public Opinion. The. last is always wrong ; the&#xD;
other is always right. The individual is generally just,&#xD;
the community very seldom. Public opinion is, there-&#xD;
fore, a mere physical power ; and as such, eternally&#xD;
changes. Common sense, on the contrary, ever and&#xD;
always accretes and intensifies, spreads and grows&#xD;
stronger as the, years and people pass away; the one is&#xD;
accidental and material; the other, personal, constitu-&#xD;
tional, and real. Now take a couple of other men, con-&#xD;
stituted precisely as was our soldier : let them, each for&#xD;
himself, commit a genteel murder ; one gets caught at&#xD;
it and is strung up and choked to death in a period of&#xD;
time, varying from four to twenty minutes; -choked till&#xD;
his eyes bulge out, his tongue lolls thick and swollen&#xD;
from his mouth-by a fellow who gets paid for the job.&#xD;
Society says this is right as Society ; but take every&#xD;
one that composes it aside, and let him look on that&#xD;
blue-black throat, at those bulging eye-balls, contorted&#xD;
features, and ghastly carrion ; ten thousand to one,&#xD;
that every man of them will denounce this legal&#xD;
choking affair as a damnable piece of buisness, totally&#xD;
unworthy of a savage, much less civilized (?) men and&#xD;
women.&#xD;
Here you see the thing is material-is the monstrous&#xD;
out-creation of the social body, and not at all related&#xD;
to man, as an individual. How happens this out-crea-&#xD;
tion of the body-politic to be so terrible ?  just go back&#xD;
a few pages and you will see that "the out-creation&#xD;
always corresponds to the condition of the being&#xD;
whence it emanates." The great mass is barbarous to-&#xD;
day ; and civilization, much less Spiritualization, is the&#xD;
exception to the general rule and order. Bye-and-bye&#xD;

&#xD;
civilization will be the rule, and then we shall have a&#xD;
bitter "Public Opinion ;" therefore, less hanging, and&#xD;
things of that sort. Let us work for it.&#xD;
Turn we now to the fellow that earned his ten dollirs&#xD;
by performing the choking operation--the nice young&#xD;
gentleman who so gaily looped the rope and pulled the&#xD;
neat little spring which sent a soul to God on a yard&#xD;
of twisted lermp. How does he feel when the job is&#xD;
over? Why, not at all uneasy. The guilt of doing&#xD;
this wicked thing is not his, he feels-albeit, he and I&#xD;
disagree on this point. It is not his, and so he "don't&#xD;
care a fig." That's it exactly. He, like the choked-&#xD;
to-death, whose eyes bulge out, who bleeds at the ears,&#xD;
whose tongue is so largely swollen that it won't stay in&#xD;
his blood-slavered mouth--he, too, I say, has sent a soul&#xD;
prematurely cross-lots home; but feeleth he remorse ?&#xD;
No more than a good dram of sixpenny damnation will&#xD;
drown-but not forever ! Oh, no 1-for just as sure as&#xD;
God reigns, he must come up to the bar for sentence,&#xD;
and must expiate his error .somewhere, at some time.'&#xD;
The judge, the jury, the legislators-all, just as the&#xD;
executioner, feel that they are clear of even this judicial&#xD;
murder, and at last, we trace the responsibility home to&#xD;
a formless, brainless monster, without a body, yet with&#xD;
a great black soul, whose name is, "PUBLIC OPINION."&#xD;
Presently, you and I, sir and madam, will beget a better&#xD;
one-God speed the day !&#xD;
Now for tlhe other murderer. He has too much tact&#xD;
and finesse to be caught, caged, and strung up. Chem-&#xD;
istry can't fasten the deed on him, nor can skilful detec-&#xD;
tives trip him up ; and so he goes along, happy as a&#xD;
lark in the day-time I But somehow or other his dreams&#xD;
are devilishly unpleasant ! Why ?-Because in the&#xD;
&#xD;
266&#xD;
&#xD;
silence of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,&#xD;
a spirit passes before his face, bearing a very astonishing&#xD;
resemblance to a former acquaintance of his, now, alas !&#xD;
deceased; and, although he is above the weakness&#xD;
of believing in "spirits," yethe often catcheshiiself ex-&#xD;
claiming, "By God, I believe it's his ghost !"-an out-&#xD;
creation of his foul within. From this day forward, the&#xD;
invisible fangs of Public Opinion, go'deeper and deeper&#xD;
into his soul-a moral augur, sinking an artesian shaft&#xD;
into his very centre-until, at last, the waters are&#xD;
reached, and burst forth in one full, deep stream of&#xD;
agony-Remorse.    The executed suffered about ten&#xD;
deaths, in expiation of the one life he took ; but this&#xD;
wretch, whose crime is not known, suffers a dozen deaths&#xD;
a day.&#xD;
Now, in a community where man-slaying don't count&#xD;
much against a citizen, this fellow would not have&#xD;
suffered one whit more than did the soldier, or Jack&#xD;
Ketch. *   *  *  *  I said that there were two kinds&#xD;
of denmons. Having described one, we will glance&#xD;
rapidly at the other ; the process is simple enough. A&#xD;
man's elevation on the scale depends upon himself'.-if&#xD;
he lotes disorder more than its opposite, hatred than&#xD;
love, the deformed than the lovely-why, the man, in&#xD;
so far forth as he departs from rectitude of his own&#xD;
purpose and will, just so far does he demonize himself.&#xD;
And as there is no limit to advancement or descension,&#xD;
so he may become guileful to an immense degree-be a&#xD;
demon.&#xD;
There are myriads of such within the compass, and&#xD;
on the confines of the Material .Realms, but none beyond&#xD;
them in the Divine City of Pure Spirit. But within&#xD;
those limits exists a Badness, so awful, so vast, that the&#xD;

soul shrinks before the terrible reality. These beings&#xD;
cannot injure our souls, save by the voluntary co-opera-&#xD;
tion of our own wills and loves.&#xD;
I content myself with this brief outline now, promising&#xD;
to take up the subject hereafter. In this book I have&#xD;
touched only a few of the lesser truths of the Universe,&#xD;
and shall go deeper next time.                                     *&#xD;
All these things came to me as I floated on the air.&#xD;
These practical lessons I received from Thotmor and&#xD;
his Cynthia, and from my own spontaneous teachings&#xD;
forth. Presently Thotmor looked lovingly upon the&#xD;
maiden at his side, and then upon myself. She 'turned&#xD;
to me, and said, "This lesson will do for the present.&#xD;
Return once more to earth."  *  *  *  * Again, a&#xD;
deep sense of drowsiness fell upon me, and seemingly,&#xD;
I slept. When next I woke, I was beneath the tree,&#xD;
and the golden sun was setting.&#xD;
This was not all I learned ; but my present task is&#xD;
finished. Patience, my reader ! Since these truths were&#xD;
written I have received a message from beyond the sea.&#xD;
I am going to cross it.- I shall speedily return and&#xD;
relate to you and all my brethren the things I there&#xD;
have seen. Till then, ADIEU!&#xD;
