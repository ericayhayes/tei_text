* IT was a lovely evening in the latter portion&#xD;
of the month of March.~-but that March was an&#xD;
Italian one. The freshwindsof a Roman spring&#xD;
caine across the intervening houses, laden with&#xD;
the p~uxiies stolen from the choice exotics ani&#xD;
rare shrubs flourishiog in the gardens of the pal.&#xD;
ace inhabited by the wealthy banker, Torlogna.&#xD;
A broad and beautiful amber covered the heaven&#xD;
which was spread over the rooi~ of the Ete~na1&#xD;
City, and, stole in with the reflex of the setting&#xD;
sun, through the large and plated windows of&#xD;
the Barberini (~afe4&#xD;
Two young men were seated at a table in one&#xD;
of these windowe~engage4 ii~ earnest co~versa-&#xD;
tion. A 1~ottl~ of lMryrna Chri~ti s~$ before&#xD;
them; bnt it was m~r~ than half full, while their&#xD;
glasue&amp;amp; were empty. Oigar., too, weing~be~&#xD;
side them; but the 4ight in one of themwas e~-&#xD;
tingni~hed, whil~ji~ faint streak of enloke wb~s?.l~&#xD;
from time to time cu4ed from the ether, inti-&#xD;
mated that it was about to follow the example.&#xD;
Their conversation had, for the. moment, o!en-&#xD;
poweredtheir love for the weed.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You caq~ ~ idea," said the &amp;amp;~st, wh~&#xD;
was very evide young milit fm~n, ~'how&#xD;
much I suffer, and am still suIF.riu&amp;amp;ft~xn th~s&#xD;
idle flincy."&#xD;
' Dut you are not ill," replied the other; "on&#xD;
the contrary, your eyes gbw, and yi~r cheeks&#xD;
burn with a fair augury of your reaching your&#xD;
hundredth year."&#xD;
This g~nt1ema~i was a dashing young fellow,&#xD;
and was sWredwith an extravagant s~mpli~ity.&#xD;
lie might have seemed to be aRoinan nobleman,&#xD;
did we n~t inviteoarr rst~1laten to his as-&#xD;
cent; this betrayed j4'~ to be a Pied*nontese.&#xD;
In fact, we wilt at once make him acquslhted&#xD;
with them. His name ,was Bernardo Dells&#xD;
Torre, and he had been~for the last two months&#xD;
residing in )~ume, wbe~ the wealth of bi~ father&#xD;
-a Genoes~ n~erchas~ who was known to be&#xD;

are my star of luck."&#xD;
"How, Guiio ~"&#xD;
"You always have such capital ideas. But,&#xD;
Bernardo, I am about to trust you with every-&#xD;
thing. You are the first man to whom I have&#xD;
said anything of my adventure; but you are a&#xD;
good fellow, and an honest friend. I don't mind&#xD;
telling you the whole of it, Bernardo."&#xD;
"Well, well, GulIjo; explain yourself."&#xD;
"You remember the Jew i"&#xD;
"What Jew2"&#xD;
"Him whore I saved, some weeks since, from&#xD;
a broad-shouldered and thick-fisted scoundrel,&#xD;
who was tormenting him in the street leading to&#xD;
the Ghetto, and who would, apparently,-.but&#xD;
that it i~as somewhat too early for such an ope-&#xD;
ration,-have rejoiced in relieving him of his&#xD;
purse, whish, you may ~nesunie, was tolerably&#xD;
well lined with scudi."&#xD;
"Yes, I remember him; but how on earth,&#xD;
Guilio, could a Jew mix himself up with thy&#xD;
fancies."&#xD;
"Who said that it was a Jew, Bernardo2"&#xD;
"You did."&#xD;
"Nonsense, maui-it is a Jewess, or an angel,&#xD;
of whom I am about to speak."&#xD;
"A Jewess! Ho! ho 1" said Bernardo, "that&#xD;
is a vary different affair."&#xD;
"Ah I how your cheeks flush, and your brow&#xD;
crimsons with pleasure. But, Bernardo, the first&#xD;
discoverer of treasure c~ugh~o be Its lawful&#xD;
possessor."&#xD;
"Arid s~ you shall be. ~oWever, let us have&#xD;
your tale."&#xD;
"Well-4ake it. It is but 'a few days si~ice&#xD;
that I was wandering In one of my dreamy&#xD;
moods near the Ghetto, when I catfie clbe to&#xD;
the entrance of that filthy, but wealthy quarter&#xD;
of the cltj. I should scarcely have ~b~etved it,&#xD;
had not the soldier, whb stood on duty at the&#xD;
gate, presented antis. I looked up' and passed&#xD;
my hand to the brow of say helmet mechanically,&#xD;
but, *. I did so. I chanced to eatch a glance of a&#xD;
group of baatlfal and btaek.eyed ~lrls, who&#xD;
were standings bin the narrow street."&#xD;
"Jewa..sl"&#xD;
"Of coarse. ~1nair S~sblng black eyeq and&#xD;

tion. No sooner bad I seen thorn than I deter-&#xD;
mined upon entering."&#xD;
"I could have .wqrn It," said Bernardo.&#xD;
"Such a cu4pvs ~i1aee as It 'was. 'fleresehit&#xD;

SOPRANO.&#xD;
while 'Come buy~ come and buy,' was shouted&#xD;
in my ears from the one below it. However,&#xD;
trade had the best of the day-religion only&#xD;
came in second. The houses almost jostled&#xD;
each other across the way-It would have been&#xD;
no great difficulty for them to do so-in their&#xD;
desire to find a purchaser. Around rae, at the&#xD;
shop-windows, hung old clothes, umbrellas, paint-&#xD;
ings, pots, tin pans, and worn out gowns. Have&#xD;
you ever been in Inghilterra ""&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
"I was going to say that it was a complete&#xD;
'rug fair,' on a more extensive scale. Well, I&#xD;
passed on among iron ware and tinsel, rugs and&#xD;
dirt of every description, while my ears were half&#xD;
stunned with "What will you buy I Excelleaza!&#xD;
Look here! Excelleuza! This is very cheap!&#xD;
What do you want? Excelleuza!' I could not&#xD;
even pause to notice a pair of beautiful and&#xD;
dark-eyed children who laughed te me from one&#xD;
of the doors, without having a faded coat thrust&#xD;
under my nose by a red-whiskered dealer in frip-&#xD;
pery, who informne4~ that I might have it fot'&#xD;
twelve seudi. Imy head. He instantly&#xD;
dropped one of t'~. and then another; and'&#xD;
had I chosen to bargain with him, I believe I&#xD;
might have had the coat, and a couple of waist-&#xD;
coats, too, for a brace of seudi. It was a wan-&#xD;
dering Puici might have written marvels of,&#xD;
when, all at once, an aged Jew emerged from a&#xD;
doorway, and bowed himself to the ground be-&#xD;
fore tm~e. If I had been the ~1ioly Father, he&#xD;
could not have shown me greater reverence-&#xD;
'Rxcdllenza I' he uttered; 'thtice noble saviour&#xD;
of tey life, blessed be the hour in which I saw&#xD;
you!' I ~tared at him. Who thcdeu~e washe I&#xD;
And, as he proceeded to pour ibrth a long rig-&#xD;
marole, whiph I did not. half nnde~ttand and&#xD;
ednutot at all remember, I gradually recalled him&#xD;
to spy recollnition." -&#xD;
"Your acquaintance I" asked Bernat-do.&#xD;
"You are right. 'Here Is my hiUnble dwell-&#xD;

me the honor of dtussing its threshold!' lie&#xD;

room. This did not seem so much amiss; but&#xD;
the girl was not there. Then the antique com-&#xD;
modity who was with me poured forth a quantity&#xD;
of gratitude in Eastern similes, which would&#xD;
have charmed a poet. I did not care a quarterpf&#xD;
a paolo fgr them. She will come at last, thought&#xD;
I to myself. Still she came, not. Meanwhile,&#xD;
the old Jew had started an idea, which you,&#xD;
probably,-abominable spendthrift,-would have&#xD;
hailed with rapture. I might occasionally want&#xD;
money, yet have no great superabundance of it.&#xD;
Consequently, I might ~e need to fly to com-&#xD;
passionate souls, who ~nted their love to&#xD;
me at varying percent thirty to fifty: So&#xD;
he told me-it is a miracle, I admit, but you&#xD;
have it fr6m him to whom the offer was made-&#xD;
he would lend me money without taking any per-&#xD;
centage at all."&#xD;
"You accepted it; pulled out your port-fenilie,&#xD;
filled up a blank stamp, and__"&#xD;
"Not at all, caro inio 2" responded Guilio,&#xD;
with a light laugh, "I did not want money."&#xD;
"But I always did, and always do," said Ber-&#xD;
nardo. "Give me the address, my friend, of the&#xD;
benevolent old money-changer."&#xD;
"He is no money.chauger, Beruardo; but let&#xD;
me go on with my story. He next asked me to&#xD;
taste his wine. I scarcely know what reply I&#xD;
made him; but this I do know, that he went into&#xD;
the adjoining room, and returned, accompanied&#xD;
by one of the loveliest maidens I have ever look-&#xD;
ed upon., The light of her beauty filled the&#xD;
gloomy chamber, and almost blinded me. Blur&#xD;
hair was as soft and as fair as the finest and&#xD;
palest, thread spun by the silk worm; her blue&#xD;
eyes swam and flashed like diamonds. But,&#xD;
what are you smacking your lips at?" he in-&#xD;
quired curiously.&#xD;
"At your descdptioniGuilio."&#xD;
"She filled my glass with some splendid tine&#xD;

I have torn         ;howIlsa~e j~dada&#xD;

them, for meeting this daughter of Jerusalem.&#xD;
I 'went two days after to borrow money, which I&#xD;
had never wanted. I took~fifty scudi from old&#xD;
Isaac, for a week, but she was not there. On the&#xD;
third morning I returned to him, with his owns&#xD;
money unchanged. He, Jew-like, not having so&#xD;
entirely relied upon my boasted honesty, smiled,&#xD;
and rubbed his hands with satisfaction. I went&#xD;
into ecstasies with his wine of Cyprus, and he&#xD;
produced me a second bottle; she, however, did&#xD;
not appear; it was he who poured it out for me&#xD;
with his meagre and trembling hand. I peered&#xD;
into every cornet-, but she was not to be seen.&#xD;
At length I was forced to leave him. As I went&#xD;
down the steps, I looked up at the house, and&#xD;
it seemed to me that a curtain, which hung&#xD;
across the window where I had first seen her,&#xD;
moved. A rose dropped at my feet, and I pick.&#xD;
ed it up. 'Adieu, signora,' I exclaimed. All&#xD;
was, however, still; not even a stray curl floated&#xD;
from behind the green silk. And now, Berua-&#xD;

am Ito do? Strikeoutabrilliantideafor me.&#xD;
'Amico ado! Be t~me as the Venus who led&#xD;

Beruardo laughed.&#xD;
"What is it that you would have me do ?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"Anything and everything."&#xD;
' Pshaw! try and talk common sense."&#xD;
"The Hebrew is a meet beautiful language; a&#xD;
poetical picture-world."&#xD;
"What of it?"&#xD;
"Study it, Berasrdo."&#xD;
"Study iii"&#xD;
"Yes. I have no taste for learning. Take&#xD;
the old Jew for your teacher, and ru pay for the&#xD;
lessons. Old Isaac belongs to the morelearned&#xD;
portion of the Ghetto. When you have won&#xD;
him, you can make the acquaintance ~f his&#xD;
daughter. Then you ean introduce me-"&#xD;

lifted the bottle, and filled his own glass.&#xD;
"Smoke out your cigar, ~r order fresh ones;&#xD;
these areburnt out; and then we will go to the&#xD;
Aliberto. The new soprano makes her first alp-&#xD;
pearance to-night."&#xD;
As he said this, Dernardo emptied his glass,&#xD;
leaned back in his chair and yawned; the truth&#xD;
was, his companion had somewhat wearied him.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
T    VI#POPULAR 3fANAG~a.-TU~ DiSOTHEiSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
was in the Teatro Aliberto that a great&#xD;
musical event was on that evening to come off,&#xD;
'This was the dei.ut of a new vocalist. In the&#xD;
North we can have no idea of the sensation pro-&#xD;
yoked by such a chance in the warmer and more&#xD;
ideal South. Italy is the land of song, and it&#xD;
was in Italy that the new singing-bird was to&#xD;
make her appearance. The amateurs of Rome&#xD;
were, consequently, in a fever of anticipation;&#xD;
nothing was talkedof but the approaching event;&#xD;
was it to be a~uccess or a failure? The mana-&#xD;
ger was no gr~at favorite, and it may easily,&#xD;
therefore, be divined which way public opinion&#xD;
tended. This, however, made no difference on&#xD;
the attendance in the Aliberto; the theatre was&#xD;
crammed to repletion. Above the audience, rose&#xD;
the magnificent~ selling, with its hovering muses&#xD;
floating; as it seemed, in an aznre sea, on which&#xD;
the glorious sun appeared reflected in gushes of,&#xD;
golden light; ~he curtain, with ell its tainted&#xD;
01 ,and the gilt arabesques on the boxes,&#xD;
were then entirely new. In each bf these last,&#xD;
lights were burning, and illuminate the world&#xD;
of loveliness which filled thehi. Della'rorre,&#xD;
with his friend and two other gentlemen, were&#xD;
sitting ina box, hear the stage, upon the second.&#xD;
tier.&#xD;
&#xD;
The overture commenced; and to this the au-&#xD;
dience seemed to listen simply for the pleasure&#xD;
of~ finding' fault wish the musicians. The un-&#xD;
popularity of manager is generally visitedupon&#xD;
the shoulders of the artists who areengaged, by&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"What an atrocious trombone is that," said&#xD;
one.&#xD;
"I think it actue  heavenly when I compare&#xD;
it with those viii   trumpets," ejaculated&#xD;
another.&#xD;
"You mean the horns; they are, in truth,&#xD;
execrable," said Della Torre.&#xD;
"Nay! they are well enough when you only&#xD;
rank them," muttered Guillo, "with the double&#xD;
bases."&#xD;
"Or the tenors!'&#xD;
"Or the first violins. They are playing false,&#xD;
now!" exclaimed Bernardo, pressing his handt&#xD;
to his ears as he spoke.&#xD;
No one was spared by these critics but the&#xD;
drummer; he was in the regiment of 'Swiss&#xD;
Guards, belonging to the Pope. Guillo Castelli&#xD;
held the rank of captain in the same tegi.&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
At length the overture *as at ~n eid, and&#xD;
the curtain rose. First came the choruswhich&#xD;

&#xD;
public opinion had long since decided, was mis.&#xD;
erable; then came the baritone, who really was&#xD;
not so good asRonconi. lie was joined by the&#xD;
tenor, who had a beautiful voice, and sung with&#xD;
more than ordinary ability. He used it in the&#xD;
style of Duprey, and chancing to fail that night&#xD;
on the attempt to reach his highest note from&#xD;
his chest, the unfortunate vocalist was hissed.&#xD;
All this was to be laid on the back of the man-&#xD;
ager. Fortunately, it was a sufficiently broad&#xD;
one. Then the scene changed, and the debutante&#xD;
made her appearance. She stood on the stage&#xD;
before her judges-a delicate and graceful crea.&#xD;
tare, infinitely beautiful and intellectual in the&#xD;
character of her physiognomy. Long, fair hair&#xD;
-we had almost grown poetical and said, like&#xD;
woven sunbeams-was braided round her exqui-&#xD;
site and gracefully-shapen brow. Her eye was&#xD;
full of intense and rapt expression; her whole&#xD;
face was such as Delaroche might have dreamed&#xD;
of for one of his Madonnas. A loud outbreak&#xD;
of stormy applause was suddenly heard; ~it wa~&#xD;
to beauty, and beauty only, that the homage~wa.&#xD;
tendered, for as yet she had not sung a note. A&#xD;
crimson flush bathed her cheek and brow, and&#xD;
colored her whole neck and bosom, as ulieliei&amp;amp;&#xD;
before that expression of popular admiration;&#xD;

&#xD;
Here an impatient murmur rose from the par-&#xD;
quette, which compelled him to silence. Then&#xD;
her voice, which had been slowly gathering cour-&#xD;
age through the recitative, burst into song, and&#xD;
poured forth in a gush of melody, all of that&#xD;
wondrous and pure emotion which, borne upon&#xD;
the wings of sound, escapes from the ~hunian&#xD;
breast. It was a burning passion which found'&#xD;
utterance from her lips, and rose towards the&#xD;
ceiling of the theatre as if to invoke di. muses,&#xD;
whose painted eyes were turned upon the stage.&#xD;
Then the last long and lingering note fell upon&#xD;
the tura of the audience, and, as it did so, through&#xD;
the whole of the house rang an universal ex-&#xD;
clamation; her triumph was complete.&#xD;
It will be unnecessary to follow 'her through&#xD;
die rest of that evening; suffice it to say, that&#xD;
her duet with the tenor was declared by the&#xD;
Diario de Rome, which was published two days&#xD;
after, to be "absolutely perfect and incompar-&#xD;
able;" and that when the curtain fell, she bad&#xD;
~l$e~re4 a triumph, and stamped her image upon&#xD;
tlni peatinnate and impressible heart of the Ro-&#xD;
man public.     ~&#xD;
'1.Aww.! Aunti Wbellal I3ellissima Anna!&#xD;

that rang for some minutes through the Aliberto.&#xD;

He took her by the band, and led heruaresist-&#xD;

moon was at its full, and flooded the street~&#xD;

SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
*    16                          THE ROMA&#xD;
him, at an early age, into the Swiss Guards of&#xD;
the Pope, where he now hdld the rankof captain,&#xD;
and hiobrother had taken him by the hand and&#xD;
introduced him into fashionable life. From the&#xD;
first, he had an ample allowance. What was&#xD;
wanting was made up at rare intervals-for Cas-&#xD;
tern was no spendthrift according to the com-&#xD;
mon acceptation of the term-by a word or, two&#xD;
from the second to the banker, Torlogna Con-&#xD;
sequently, his purse was never empty; while,&#xD;
singularly enough, the spot upon his birth in no&#xD;
wayinterfered with his standing in society. Sup-&#xD;
ported by his family connections, that man must&#xD;
have been very sure of his own position, who&#xD;
would have ventured either to breathe a slur up-&#xD;
on his character, or on account of his birth, t6&#xD;
put a-slight upon the young officer.&#xD;
As he opened the door of his chamber, a young&#xD;
man, who was slight in person, and attired in the&#xD;
extreme of fashion, looked up from the chair on&#xD;
which he was sitting, and said:&#xD;
"So you're here at last, Guilio i have wait-&#xD;
ed for you for the last hour. Where have you&#xD;
been "'&#xD;
"My good Federigo," uttered the young offi-&#xD;
Ca', as he bent forward and kissed the brow of his&#xD;
-brother, for it was the Borghese who had been&#xD;
waiting (~r him, "why did you not tell me that&#xD;
youwlshedtoseeme4 You knowmetoo well&#xD;
to dei~bt~ that I should have hastened home-&#xD;
wards."             -&#xD;
"How coulill have told you what, some four&#xD;
hours earlier I did not know myself. I have&#xD;
this evening been to the era, Guilio, and&#xD;
am-&#xD;
"Say it not! Borghese; thrice miserable&#xD;
shall I find myself to have lost not only a friend,&#xD;
but to lote my brother on the score of my unhap-&#xD;
py passion."&#xD;
Federigo Borghese stared upon Guilio as if he&#xD;
could not comprehend him.&#xD;
"What is the matter, my poor boy V' he said,&#xD;
as he lifted his hand and swept back the cluster-&#xD;
ing curls from his brother's bro~w. "I come here&#xD;
simply to tell you that I had determined upon&#xD;
bestowing my tediousness upon you for the rest&#xD;
of the evening, when you declare that you are&#xD;
'thrice miserable,' ai4 end by talking of 'your&#xD;
unhappy passion.' What does it all mean,&#xD;
Gullio1" -&#xD;
The young man bent his brow upon his out.&#xD;
&#xD;
"One of us. What the deuce, Guilio, if your&#xD;
mother was nobody, a Borghese was beyond any&#xD;
question your father. Look in the mirror; if the&#xD;
relation be not apparent, tell me that I am a fool,&#xD;
and forswear my friendship !"&#xD;
As he aaid this he had caught Guiio round&#xD;
the waist, and dragged him in front of a large&#xD;
glass which was set into the walls of the apart-&#xD;
ment. The light of a lamp which hung from&#xD;
the ceiling fell upon theni. As the two broth-&#xD;
ers gazed upon their reflection upon its polished&#xD;
surface, a mutual and passionate feeling of broth-&#xD;
erhood rushed over them; the same chestnut&#xD;
hair swept in long and glossycurls around the&#xD;
brow of either.; the same faint and silken mous-&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
tache curled around their upper lips; the same&#xD;
dark, full and glowing eyes flashed from either&#xD;
forehead. Almost alike in stature,-Borghese&#xD;
was somewhat taller,-youth and beauty, they&#xD;
gazed upon the mirror. Then they turned t9&#xD;
each other; the prince opened his arms, and&#xD;
Guile rushed into them.&#xD;
"Is it agreed, my brother ~"&#xD;
"Yes, my own Federigo! But Torlogna-"&#xD;
"What of him I"&#xD;
"Does he know bet I"&#xD;
"If not, I will give him twenty-four hours&#xD;
to make her acquaintance. Never fear. His&#xD;
new title wants to be accredited; he will do any-&#xD;
thing I ask him."&#xD;
&#xD;
1-&#xD;
&#xD;
spread hands; flunghimself on a chairbeside his&#xD;
brother, and burst juto a passionate fit of tears.&#xD;
"Child 1', continued Federigo, as he drew away&#xD;
one of Castelli's hands, "this is foolish. Tears&#xD;
belong to woman; they are her only weapon4,&#xD;
But when a soldier weeps, pshaw! Were ~ou&#xD;
not my brother, I would tell you that you must&#xD;
be a coward 1,'&#xD;
"A coward !" answeWd Guilio, raising his&#xD;
eyes, flashing with a sos~brejight through the&#xD;
tears that still stood in them. "No! Pederigo,&#xD;
you know that I am no coward. But, Federigo,&#xD;
for the first timein my life-"&#xD;
"Which l~s scarcely been so very long an ex-~&#xD;
istence; has it ~"&#xD;
"I am in love."&#xD;
"Good !-we U.ti~twjinAe&#xD;

I-no. I never reniember wei4            -~&#xD;

Guillo 2"&#xD;
The question was sufficient to loosen the llp~&#xD;
of the young C~astelli, and l~e poured forth the&#xD;
whole of his brief love-dream into the ears ef his&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
"And is this alP!"&#xD;
"Yes, all!"&#xD;
"Well, Guillo, your habit of painting every&#xD;
chance with the palette of a ~embrandt, has&#xD;
misled you. I do not love Deil~ Torre, and&#xD;
have always regretted that you should have&#xD;
made him so' constantly your companion; but&#xD;
how you could have dreamed that his chance ac-&#xD;
quaintanceship with the -Brigni argued a passion&#xD;
for her appears incomprehensible to me. Love&#xD;
in modem timus is not the passion engendered -&#xD;
by a moment, which poets and-"&#xD;
"Mine was, Federigo."&#xD;
The prince felt l~e was wrong. However, he&#xD;
did not own this, but entered upon a learned&#xD;
examination of the nature of love which, we&#xD;
wilf not inflict upon our readers, begging them&#xD;
to remember that th~ noble lecturerwas barely&#xD;
twenty'two years of age, and this, the more es-&#xD;
p~ially, as the termination of it was the euly&#xD;
portion to which Guilio listened with interest.&#xD;
"Wait until the morning, my boy. Torlo~n~s&#xD;
shall introduce both of us, and we sb~all soonsee&#xD;
whether the sigitora does not prefer thaadmira.&#xD;
ton of the best blood in B~me to that of ied.&#xD;

"But I, prince, am-"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7671-00000008"/>&#xD;
Tim banker, Torlogna, had done all that the&#xD;
young Borghese had required of him; he had&#xD;
presented the two young men to the enchantress&#xD;
who had crazed all musical Rome, to the intense&#xD;
disgustof that portion of it which was immersed&#xD;
in the politics of the papacy, and who kindly&#xD;
consigned her and he~ adorers to the lowest pit&#xD;
of purgatory, as the slightest possible reparation&#xD;
for her popultirity and their madness.&#xD;
If a group chanced to be standing before the&#xD;
Laocoon, they were not lost in admiration of that&#xD;
marvellous piece of sculp~ie-they were talking&#xD;
of the new soprano; if you wandered in the&#xD;
Coliseum at midnight, and stumuiled over two&#xD;
friends, they were speaking of "labellaBrigni."&#xD;
Did you stand in the nave of St. reter's during&#xD;
the hours of morning muss, you might count&#xD;
upon hearing her name ten times in a minute, at&#xD;
the very least, from those who passed near you.&#xD;
What wonder was it, that one of the most pious&#xD;
of all the cardinals..-.member, though he ~ of&#xD;
the Borghese famuly,-expresaed his a~tonish.&#xD;
zuent that the cupola did not fall, and extinguish,&#xD;
for the moment, her name and their admiration!&#xD;
If the Brigni drove out, her carriage was sur-&#xD;
rounded and followed by the whole of equestrian&#xD;
So~ae. The young Colonnas would be on one&#xD;
side; Borghese and his brother-when the latter&#xD;
was not on duty-would be upon the other&#xD;
&#xD;
Della Torre, and scores of the fashionable idlers&#xD;
in the capital of modem Italy, would swell out&#xD;
the cavalcade. If she went to purchase half a&#xD;
yard of cambric, her cortege would give you the&#xD;
idea of a regal procession. When she passed&#xD;
her handkerchief over her brow, the beggar who&#xD;
stood in the Piazza del Popolo murmured a bless-&#xD;
ing. Once she threw a paolo to a poor cripple,&#xD;
and the gold and silver that rained upon him&#xD;
from the hands of her admirers, made him a&#xD;
wealthy man.&#xD;
Amongst them, however, were two who had&#xD;
the envy of all the rest of young Rome; indeed,&#xD;
we might have said three, for there were few&#xD;
who had the chance of seeing the distinction&#xD;
which she drew between the Borghese, with his&#xD;
brother, and Bernardo Della Tone. To the&#xD;
three, she was always "at home ;" but within&#xD;
her apartments, a very clear and tangible dis-&#xD;
tinction existed.&#xD;
From the first moment that she knew Guilio,&#xD;
she had liked him; and when he was presented&#xD;
to her by Torlogna, she told him, with a winning&#xD;
rankness, that there was no necessity for his pro.&#xD;
curing an introduction, and that she should have&#xD;
been glad to have welcomedhila as one towbom&#xD;
she had been personally indebted. As yet, how-&#xD;
ever, he had never been alone with her, and had&#xD;
not found an opportunity to solve what was still&#xD;

20                  THE ROMAN SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nay, Guilio, but 1you must! Think how&#xD;
greatly you have been Indolited to the kindness&#xD;
of the Borgh.ese family; to the old prince you&#xD;
owe~verything; your very birth is .-"&#xD;
~' One of his kindne~ses," broke out Castelli.&#xD;
"Yes, truly owehim all; you'areright; yes,&#xD;
you are right," and with a violent oath, he re-&#xD;
leased himself from the arm of Dernardo, strode&#xD;
along the battery, and entered the saloon at its&#xD;
further end., As he did so, he did not hear the&#xD;
mocking laugh which rang from the lips of his&#xD;
late companion.&#xD;
At the request of' the princess, the Brigni was&#xD;
about to sing and the whole of the company in&#xD;
those vast saloons were silent in expectation. A&#xD;
skilful musician was seated at'the piano. Beside&#xD;
him stood the soprano, and at no great distance&#xD;
from her stood the young Borghese. In his&#xD;
present temper, it appeared to Guilio, that the&#xD;
whole expression of his~face breathed and spoke&#xD;
of love. The musician touched tire keys and&#xD;
played a brief jrelnde, after wl4~k her matchle.ss&#xD;
voice broke into song. A change came over&#xD;
the wayward spirit of the listener. As Guilio&#xD;
listened to her, the suspicion which had pre-&#xD;
viously agitated him, melted from his seul. He&#xD;
remembered every word of kindness she had&#xD;
breathed tohiui; he retraced the brotherly love&#xD;
which had bound him to one whom he had so&#xD;
lately faticied his rival; he denounced himself&#xD;
for those s4splcions which wereawept away and&#xD;
obliterated in the rush of that wondrous voice;&#xD;
he had already drawn nearer to her. Then he&#xD;
thought of the first time he' had ever seen her,&#xD;
and called 'to mind the ~pressure of those tAper&#xD;
fingers when he had first visited her under the&#xD;
wing of Terlogita. Still he drew nearer; all&#xD;
his jealousy had passed away; he was again&#xD;
the willing slave of 'her beauty and her song.&#xD;
Longere she bad concluded, he had beat his&#xD;
'way, silently and almost timidly, towards her,&#xD;
and found himself standing side by side with&#xD;
his brother. Federigo nodded to him, and&#xD;
smiled as (*uilio took his hand and pressed ii&#xD;
,-4ha one was listening to her with the ear of a&#xD;
'musician, the other heard her through the soui&#xD;
of a lover.&#xD;
As she concluded the aria which she had beer&#xD;
singing, thers was a general and rQtureru&#xD;
&#xD;
murmur of applause.. The Princess Borghese&#xD;
rose, leaned forward, pnd pressed her lips to the&#xD;
cheek of the Brigni.&#xD;
"What would I not give," said the Banker&#xD;
Torlogna, "to purchase such a kiss I"&#xD;
"They may not be bought, old money.&#xD;
broke" murmured~, Federigo, in his ear.&#xD;
She had dropped her handkerchief. Gu.flio&#xD;
stooped, picked it up,, and stepping forward,&#xD;
presented it to her.&#xD;
As she saw him, a slight flush colored her&#xD;
cheek.&#xD;
"I thank you, signor; I faneied~my friend had&#xD;
deserted me, for I had not' seen you."&#xD;
There was such an indescribable accent of&#xD;
kindliness in her voice~ something which chid&#xD;
hizu so aweetlyand unconsciously for his suspi-&#xD;
cions, that Guilio colored beneath her glance.&#xD;
"Signora," he replied' "I have been present&#xD;
since you first entered the saloon."&#xD;
A slight laugh caught'his ear; he felt that it&#xD;
was the laugh of Della Torre.&#xD;
"And what excuse can he offer me, prince I"&#xD;
she said, turning to the younger Borghese, "for&#xD;
putting upon me so gross a neglect as this ~"&#xD;
," None," answered Pederigo, gazing upon&#xD;
Castelli, "unless it were that possibly he feared&#xD;
to intrude upon the time which was so pleasant.&#xD;
ly occupied in listening to the praL~ea and&#xD;
receiving the flatteries of others."&#xD;
An hour afterwards, Guillo accompanied the&#xD;
Brigni to her carriage. After handing her in&#xD;
with the elderly lady, whose chaperonage pro-&#xD;
tected her from malevolent rumors in the almost&#xD;
universal laxity of Italian manners, she bent&#xD;
forward'tohinl and said:&#xD;
"Were it not for the reproaches I should&#xD;
incur for dragging you away from your friends,&#xD;
I might perhaps have asked you to accompany&#xD;
us."&#xD;
Scarcely had the words quitted her lips, than&#xD;
the lover bounded into the carriage.&#xD;
"Signora, I accept your invitation eve you&#xD;
have well breathed it ;" and,,in the next instant,&#xD;
the carriage was pullingg out of the 9ourt-yard of&#xD;
the Borghese place, while he was sitting in it,&#xD;
gazing upon those beautiful eyes which beamed&#xD;
upon him from, the darkness that almost imine-&#xD;
I diately surrounded them.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
JEWISH CHAniry AED CIIIIISTIAN LOVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
A DELICIOUS little supper was that which&#xD;
awaited Castelli-for he found himself almost&#xD;
alone, for the first time, in the society of her&#xD;
whom he adored, as the old lady, true to her&#xD;
functions as a chaperone "of necessity," ate and&#xD;
drank, and scarcely uttered a single word.&#xD;
A hundred questions which he longed to put&#xD;
to the musical syren flashed across his mind;&#xD;
but he was alike unable to muster the courage&#xD;
either for framing or uttering them. "Were&#xD;
Della Torre or Federigoin my place,"hethought,&#xD;
"how soon would the queries be put to her which&#xD;
are hovering on my tongue. Why is it that I&#xD;
cannot sneak"' Then he would make up his&#xD;
mind to do so; but ~ro sooner did he look up and&#xD;
meet her eyes, than the words which he had just&#xD;
framed seemed to die upon his tongue.&#xD;
At length the supper was terminated, and&#xD;
Anna laid her hand gently upon his arm; the&#xD;
touch thrilled through him.&#xD;
"You wish to ask mc something," she said.&#xD;
"Why is it that you will not do so I"&#xD;
"It is my doubt, signora, in how far your kind-&#xD;
ness may pardon the impertinence of my quarry,&#xD;
that prevents my giving it an utterance."&#xD;
"If so, you must let me tell you what you&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
wish to know, ~without exposing you to the&#xD;
chance of a reproof."&#xD;
Castelli thanked her with his eyes.&#xD;
"Your glances have so often questioned me,&#xD;
that I feel I shall not be comfortable until you&#xD;
know the whole of my little history. You have&#xD;
imagined that I was a Jewess I"&#xD;
The young Roman bowed in assent.&#xD;
"It is not so; although I am indebted to a&#xD;
Jew for that kindness which but few Christians&#xD;
would have shown to an unfriended child. My&#xD;
father was a scholar, and dwelt in Bologna,&#xD;
where he occupied the chair of modern languages&#xD;
in the university, The Rabbi Isaac is also a&#xD;
singular master of the modern tongues. Chance&#xD;
made them acquainted. As you perhaps may&#xD;
know, the learned have not those prejudices&#xD;
which are so common in the rest of Italy-reli.&#xD;
gious prejudices. Their acquaintance ripened&#xD;
into esteem; that esteem alternately became a&#xD;
warm friendship. My father died while I was&#xD;
no more than a mere child. He had not shown&#xD;
that care over his worldly affairs which he had&#xD;
expended upon the duties of his position. The&#xD;
world knew nothing of the existence of my moth-&#xD;
er and myself-how or why should it' trouble&#xD;
about us ~"&#xD;

&#xD;
"And had you no relatives 2-none whom&#xD;
purely personal considerations might have forced&#xD;
to assist you ~&#xD;
"0, yes; my parent wrote to her only brother,&#xD;
who was a married man; he sent her ten scudi."&#xD;
"The abominable wretch!" ejaculated Guilio.&#xD;
"But these ten scudi were accompanied by an&#xD;
admirable letter of advice; that is to say, it&#xD;
would have been admirable could she but have&#xD;
followed it. She wept bitterly. I saw her weep,&#xD;
and cried with her; then I jumped up and&#xD;
clapped my hands together. My mother dried&#xD;
her eyes, and looked at me.&#xD;
"'Why do you not write to the man with the&#xD;
black eyes and long beard, who came so often to&#xD;
see my father'!"' I asked, impulsively.&#xD;
"She knew whom I meant, thought a little,&#xD;
and then did so. Five days after, Isaac arrived&#xD;
in Bologna, lie sold off all the furniture, and&#xD;
ls~ought us back with him to Rome. We now&#xD;
lived in the Ghetto. It was four years after this.&#xD;
that my mother died. After my tears had begun&#xD;
of thems4lies to dry-for I was still ,scarcely&#xD;
more than a child,-Isaae spoke with me. He&#xD;
told me that he considered me as his daughter,&#xD;
bitt that he was far from being wealthy. Learn-&#xD;
ing can rarely gather wealth. Moreover, I was&#xD;
a Christian, and he gave me to understand that&#xD;
I must not marry a Jew~"&#xD;
"The excellent old man I"&#xD;
"It would consequently be necessary for me&#xD;
to do something to ensure my future. I then&#xD;
had a beautiful voice, whatever 'it may now be,&#xD;
and it was his advice that I should cultivate it.&#xD;
But he did more than to advise this. He placed&#xD;
me under the care of a Christian lady,-she is&#xD;
now sitting beside us,-~nd sent me for the fol-&#xD;
lowing three years to Florence to study, under&#xD;
the tuition of Ronconi. Twice a year be came&#xD;
to see me, for the purpose of settling our ex-&#xD;
penses, and the result is as you have seen. Is&#xD;
he not a noble man2"&#xD;
"One of God's own making," was the impet~&#xD;
uonsan4 very un-Italian.likn.answer ~f Castelli.&#xD;
While she had continued speaking, he had'lia-&#xD;
tened %o her with a strange- feelii~ of deligiit.&#xD;
Qac bar in their union, which he. had hitherto&#xD;
believed irremovable, gradually 4ias~lved be-&#xD;
twe~n them; and as she finished, he felt that&#xD;
thog already stood nearer to each other. She&#xD;
w~ppf the same creed.as hin~self, a44 adQred in&#xD;
the same temples, which were open for his own&#xD;
&#xD;
worship. An irrepressible gladness enfolded&#xD;
his soul; lie would then have opened his heart&#xD;
to her, and had he doneso, how great a sorrow&#xD;
would have been saved to them both. But,&#xD;
bolt upright at his left hand, sat the Christian&#xD;
dame, to whose supervision 'Isaac had entrusted&#xD;
her, and the chill of her presence was upon both&#xD;
of them, although Anna was as yet unconscious&#xD;
of it, for she was as yet in heart no more than a&#xD;
child-we, of course, mean an Italian child.&#xD;
Castelli's mouth was consequently closed.&#xD;
His eyes, however, fell upon her, and there&#xD;
was a b~rning light in them which could not be&#xD;
mistahett, and her's sank before them. He felt&#xD;
that in that look he had told her all his love,&#xD;
an4 that she had listened to him. What a pity&#xD;
It was that he could not conquer his liver-like&#xD;
shame-facedness, and tell her. all that was then&#xD;
struggling within him.&#xD;
Happiness generally comes ~o an end more&#xD;
rapidly thiin sorrow. The old lady passed.iter&#xD;
hand up 'to vermouth; it was unmistakable; she&#xD;
was wearied with him. Yawning over theirlove,&#xD;
she was pining for her bed. Guihio was young,&#xD;
and obeyed the hint which she had given him.&#xD;
As he took the band of Anna Brigni, and&#xD;
pressed his lips upon it, he felt that his love had&#xD;
mastered his whole soul. The door of the house&#xD;
opened, and he went forth. As be stood upon&#xD;
the steps leading into the street, the moonlight,&#xD;
which 'had just risen and fell across the tops of&#xD;
the houses, caught upon a crumpled lot of white&#xD;
paper which was. lying before him. Without&#xD;
knowing why he did so, he picked it up, and&#xD;
bounded down the steps. This night he was off,&#xD;
duty at'the Vaticau~ and had arranged to sleep&#xD;
in hi~ old chamber at the Borghese palaces As&#xD;
he passed th*nsgh the arch~ws.y leading into the&#xD;
interior, the last carriages of the guests werede-&#xD;
parting, and he mounted the broad staircase to&#xD;
inquire for Federigo. He was not to be found;&#xD;
but theold prince told him that he had:quitted&#xD;
the saloon , some half hour since, in company&#xD;
with the.younger of the Colonnas, and Bernardo&#xD;
DellaTorre. Re then looked atGuilio witl~an&#xD;
inquiring glance.&#xD;
"But, my boy, what's it that has chan~eed to&#xD;
you? Your cheelcs are flushed with pleasure,&#xD;
and your eyes seem to be dancing with some su-&#xD;
preme joy."&#xD;
"Prince, it isuothing," answered GUi1IO Cas-&#xD;
telli, s~ he colore~l deeply beneath his parent's&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROMA&#xD;
scrutinizing look. "It is only the excitement&#xD;
of the evening which makes it appear so."&#xD;
Even as he replied to the old man, his eyes fell&#xD;
for a moment-it was no moz~-.upon the crump-&#xD;
led piece of paper which he still held in his hand.&#xD;
It was a lette d as he caught the address, a&#xD;
strange exp of rage flashed over his coun-&#xD;

writing and the name, which had been inscribed&#xD;
upon it. Controlling himself bya violent effort,&#xD;

hand of the old nobleman. Immediately after,&#xD;
he had quitted the saloon, and taking a light&#xD;
from one of the domestics, ascended the staircase&#xD;
leading to his chamber. For same moments, the&#xD;
prince gazed after him, lost in~thought, and then&#xD;
retired to his own apartment.&#xD;

those wondrous sunsets which c~lor the skies of&#xD;
evening above the waters of the blue .~gean.&#xD;
"And so I thought it best to leave hire to him-&#xD;
self. When he has recovered from his present&#xD;
moodiness, signora, you may certainly count&#xD;
upon seeing him."&#xD;
The Easter sunday had at length arrived, and&#xD;
Anna had consented to accompany the Bankers&#xD;
Torlogna to the cathedral of St.'Peter's, to see&#xD;
the Pope bless the people. The young Borghese&#xD;
had been invited to make a third in Torlogna's&#xD;
carriage, and had readily agreed to do so. The&#xD;
sable curtains which for five long weeks had&#xD;
covered the pictures in every chapel an4 church&#xD;
which seem to dot Rome, had now fallen, and&#xD;
throughout the city, its Easter gladness. Jiad&#xD;
awakened. The bells were ringing; cardinals&#xD;
and ambassadors rolled abroad in their pompous&#xD;
equipa~es; the carriages of the nobility and&#xD;
wealthy foreigners, surrounded by the intermin-&#xD;
able crowd of promenaders, filled the long and&#xD;
narrow streets. From the castle of St. Angelo,&#xD;
waved that great flag which bears upon its folds&#xD;
the painted image of the Madonna and the papal&#xD;
arms; music was playing in the Square of St.&#xD;
Peter's; the fountains dashed their gigantic col-&#xD;
umns of spray upwards to the heavens; on the&#xD;
benches, beneath the colonnade, crowds of per-&#xD;
sons were already sitting; and then from the&#xD;
portals of St. Peter's, issue~l as huge a throng.&#xD;
A sea of human beings filled the whole of that&#xD;
vast space, heaving and swaying to and fro.&#xD;
Peasants and boys climbed the pedestals of the&#xD;
statues, in order to behold the Pope when he is-&#xD;
sued from the church.&#xD;
At length he was borne from its portals, sitting&#xD;
in a magnificent chair, supportedd by six stalwort&#xD;
priests, who were arrayed in robes of black silk,&#xD;
and the two younger priests, who preceded them,&#xD;
waved fans of colossal peacocks' tails on ashen&#xD;
staves, ornamented with silver. Vessels of in-&#xD;
cense swung before him; cardinals and bishops&#xD;
surrounded him, and the Swiss Guards filed after&#xD;
them, c~losing the procession.&#xD;
"H~e is very pale," said the Brigni, whose lorg-&#xD;
non was bent-so it seemed, at least, to Torlogna&#xD;
-upon the Pope.&#xD;
The Borghese caught her meaning more rap-&#xD;
idly, for his glass soon discovered Guilio, and&#xD;
enabled him to peruse the features of his brother.&#xD;
"Well," said the banker, "itis natural enough;&#xD;
the old man-I mean his Holiness-must be very&#xD;
weary."&#xD;
Neither of them replied to him.&#xD;

Scarcely had the ps~ieossion, emerged from the&#xD;
doors of the church, than the choirs, stationed&#xD;
around it, received it 'with a butst of triumph.&#xD;
The Pope was horrt~ u~ tha hiftysteps which&#xD;
lead to the gallery in front of the cathedral. Here&#xD;
he advanced, encircled by the cardinals, and all&#xD;
present dropped upon their knees. Women and&#xD;
children, priests and peasants, the soldiers, the&#xD;
nobles, and the populace bent before him; only&#xD;
the Protestant stranger, whom curiosity had&#xD;
drawn there, stood erect; and there in the midst&#xD;
of the universal silence which had fallen upon&#xD;
that vast multitude, the aged priest spread out&#xD;
his hands and blessed them. Then two papers&#xD;
fluttered down from the balcony; one contained&#xD;
a forgiveness of sins to the faithful, and the other&#xD;
was a written curse upon the enemies of the&#xD;
Church; the populace who were immediately be-&#xD;
neath the gallery, contended for the smallest&#xD;
scrap of them.&#xD;
Once more the hells of all the churches rang,&#xD;
and the crowd had risen from their knees. Mu-&#xD;
sic mingled itself in the general joy; the Pope&#xD;
retired from the gallery, and all was over.&#xD;
As they drove back with Torlogna,-for they&#xD;
were to pass the day at the banker's mansion,&#xD;
-the ~rigiil and Federigo were both silent; the&#xD;
pale face and wan cheeks of Guilio seemed to /&#xD;
chase every gentler and happier thought from&#xD;
them. For the first time they wished to be&#xD;
alone, together, and Dorghese reproached him.-&#xD;
self for not having insisted upon Castelli's visit-&#xD;
ing the signora. She had wondered at his ab-&#xD;
sence, and still more did she marvel at the&#xD;
change which had come over him. Scarcelyinore&#xD;
than a week since, she had seen the color of&#xD;
youth and health on his cheeks; now this was&#xD;
blotted out, and he seemed whitened with suffer-&#xD;
ing. His brow had been knit; not a muscle of&#xD;
his face had played with the emotions ~of joy and&#xD;
love which had formerly made it a picture she&#xD;
could not tire of gazing on. When he had&#xD;
kneeled to receive the papal blessing, the action&#xD;
was rather that of a machine, representing life,&#xD;
than a human being.&#xD;
The day gradually wore through. 2~he dinner&#xD;
was unexceptionable; the wine excellent, and the&#xD;
company well chosen. This of course had its&#xD;
effect, and scarcely was it more than half over,&#xD;
era the Eorghese recovered his spirits. He&#xD;
laughed and jested with the Brigni, and partially&#xD;
succeeded in dispelling her uneasiness. Once&#xD;
she found en opportunity of questioning him,&#xD;
and instantly seized upon it. As he listened to&#xD;

DAY after day rolled gradually along. It was Frenchman, her incipient likingfor Castelli, while&#xD;

She was pacified with this proi~ise.&#xD;
was the evening of the illumination of St.&#xD;
Peter's. Who that has once gazed upon that&#xD;
facade of fire can ever forget it? The whole of&#xD;
that gigantic dome is traced in a burning Qutirne&#xD;
upon the blue heavens. It actually quivers with&#xD;
light, and when the fiery structure-for so it&#xD;
seems-is seen from the bridge of St. Augelo,&#xD;
reflected in the yellow Tiber, it strikes upon the&#xD;
eye as a huge transparency; so mighty snd im-&#xD;
posing in its outlines that it would almost appear&#xD;
the work of some supernatural and fairy hand.&#xD;
And then, when the ~ignal is given for the&#xD;
change, and the thousands of men stationed on&#xD;
its roof touch the pitch garlands hanging around&#xD;
them with flame, the enormous structure be-&#xD;
comes a blaring temple, towering over the impe-&#xD;
rial city which lies and breathes around it.&#xD;
"Only think," said Anna, "of the danger en-&#xD;
countered by the miserable individual who hin-&#xD;
dIes the topmost light on the erpas of~he cupola."&#xD;
"With what pride he msz~t gaze on the blazing&#xD;

"J3esides thinking very sgreeably of the twen-&#xD;
ty scudi which pay him for the danger, and are&#xD;

the banker.&#xD;
After fasting their eyes on the scene before&#xD;
them, it was proposed that they should drive up&#xD;
the~onte Pinejo, and gaze upon it from a great-&#xD;
er distance. So the vetturi,~received his orders,&#xD;
and the carriage, after a drive of half an hour,&#xD;
drew up at the little inn on the side of the hill.&#xD;
From this point, the view of the cupola was&#xD;
glorious; it seemed hewn from a burning sun.&#xD;
Such might apoetfancy was tire masonry of Par-&#xD;

ment, arched in by that singular scene, uppor-&#xD;
alleled for its splendor in the world, it ~ees~ied&#xD;
as if the influence of its magic beauty liq4 melted&#xD;
him to love. ,He whispered to her of it~ loveli-&#xD;
ness; he talked to her of its wonders; and her&#xD;
lips replied ~o him ,in a tremulous accent, ~s if&#xD;
she, too,,had warmed to him under theruagic&#xD;
power of the ~c~ene. As for the bank9r-why,&#xD;
he was aniap of nsiddle age,-he had ye~ly en-&#xD;
joyed itt.t~om his boyhood. He leaned from the&#xD;
carnage, and beckoned to a man who was stand-&#xD;

the inn streau~ed across the spot where he stood.&#xD;
In the darkness~ which rendered it impossible to&#xD;
trace his features, Tprlogna ispagined tli~t he&#xD;

"Bring me a glass of water."&#xD;
The man did not stir.&#xD;
"Do you not hear me I" 'ejaculated Torlogna.&#xD;
Federigo turned to him, and said:&#xD;
"I will procure you and the signora some re-&#xD;
freshment ;" and without remaining to hear the&#xD;
banker's. disclaimer of giving him so snuck&#xD;
trouble, he leaped from the carriage and passed&#xD;
into the little ipn.&#xD;
The man followed him, and in another mo-&#xD;
ment, voices were heard from the interior of the&#xD;
house. They grew louder, and the Brigni recog-&#xD;
nized the accents of Castelli. She caught hold&#xD;
of Toriogna's wrist.&#xD;
"Do you hear?"&#xD;
"What ~"&#xD;
"That is the voice of the brother of Bor-&#xD;
ghese I"&#xD;
As she said this, a sudden flash illu~inated&#xD;
the passage *hich led intothe interior of the hos-&#xD;
telry, and as it did so, a pistol-shot. rang on the&#xD;
spot. Anna Brigni bounded like a startled fawn&#xD;
from the carriage, and rushed into the interior of&#xD;
the inn.&#xD;

"Peace! far you shall hear me! As I listened&#xD;

"Mad boy !-listen to inc I"&#xD;
"Federigo, I must die I"&#xD;
"You are dreaming, Guilio."&#xD;
"Slay me, my brother I-or must I kill uiiyself&#xD;
this night before you I"&#xD;
Federigo started back in horror; but the li&amp;amp;nd&#xD;
of Guillo was still faMened upon his wrist, and&#xD;
he was unable to flee from the presence of the&#xD;
maddened boy. Panting and scared by the&#xD;
glowing passion of that monotonous volta, he&#xD;
was forced to listen to him.&#xD;
"Take the pistol and consummate my mur-&#xD;
der I Probably, I should have killed myself this&#xD;
night; now you shall slay me I"&#xD;
"Guilio I my brother Guilio, let me speak I"&#xD;
"I will not !-t.ake it !" And still grasping&#xD;
the wrist of his brother, he extended the weapon&#xD;
to him which he had plucked from the bosom of&#xD;
his dress, without a change, either in his hoarse,&#xD;
bitter voice, or in the death-like expression of his&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Why should I, Guilio?"&#xD;
"Rave I not told you? Take it."&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
Wunar Federigo had passed into the inn, he&#xD;
had soon found the waiter, and had directed him&#xD;
to bring some refreshments. He then returned&#xD;
through the narrow passage, which was only lit&#xD;
by ai~ oil lamp hanging at its further end, when&#xD;
he saw a figure standing before him. It was that&#xD;
of his brother. A short cloak, which was flung&#xD;
hack from his shoulders, hung around him. It&#xD;
was black, and even in that vague and gloomy&#xD;
light formed a strong contrast with the deathly&#xD;
pallor of his countenance. The expression of&#xD;
his features was fixed, and he stood there like a&#xD;
shadow returned from that Hades which the old&#xD;
Romans peopled with the dead. For the mo-&#xD;
meat, Federigo recoiled, or would ha~e done so,&#xD;
had not Guiio thrust forth his hand, almost me-&#xD;
chanically~ and grasped him by the wrist. His&#xD;
eyes were glaring from the immobility of the&#xD;
rest of his countenance with the delirium of&#xD;
fever.&#xD;
"Federigo 1"&#xD;
His voice was so hollow and so unmodulated,&#xD;
that it struck on the ears of his brother like the&#xD;
voice of a dead man.&#xD;
"You have strewn my life with the ashes of&#xD;
bitterness and misery, Federigo! Yet had I re-&#xD;
solved to permit it all to pass-to forgive you,&#xD;
and to die! Now that I have seen you bending&#xD;
over her-"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Come with me to her! Madman 1"&#xD;

ghese.&#xD;
"That she may loll you how truly she loves&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"And that I may again find a letter addressed&#xD;
by you to the 'divine Anna I"' responded Cas.&#xD;
telli.&#xD;
"A letter!"&#xD;
"Ay."&#xD;
"It is false !"&#xD;
"Of course! of course! Take it."&#xD;
"Come with me, Guilio." And as he said this,&#xD;
he laid his hand upon the shoulder of his brother.&#xD;
"She shall convince you that you have indeed&#xD;
been dreaming."&#xD;
Guilio pushed him rudely hack, but Federigo&#xD;
was determined to lead him to the carriage.&#xD;
There was a short, sharp struggle, and then a&#xD;
report was heard. For a moment the confined&#xD;
passage was filled with smoke, and a cry of pain&#xD;
rung on the sti~lnesa of the night. The smoke&#xD;
cleared gradually away, as Federigo staggered&#xD;
back and sunk upon the ground.&#xD;
Castelli reeled back against the wall. For a&#xD;
moment he was blinded mid deafes~ed by the an-&#xD;
guish resulting from that fearful chance. Then&#xD;
he heard the voices of the people of the house&#xD;
around him, and a wild exclamation of:&#xD;
"Santa Maria !-what is this ~"&#xD;
It was the voice of the Brigni.&#xD;
"Federigo I" he shouted in despair, and would&#xD;
have cast himself uponthe body; hut Anna was&#xD;
already upon her knees beside it, endeavoring to'&#xD;
afaunch the blood that welled from the wound in&#xD;
his breast. She lifted her head, and fastened a&#xD;
steady look upon (luillo's convulsed and terror-&#xD;
stricken countenance.&#xD;
"Unhappy man I" she murmured, and then&#xD;
she again looked down, and the tears from her&#xD;
eyes rained upon the senseless bosom of Federigo&#xD;
Borghese.&#xD;
&#xD;
Torlogna caught the hands of the young Cas&#xD;
telli, and bade him save himself.&#xD;
"I am innocent I" he cried aloud. "Tell&#xD;
them, Federigo, that I am innocent of this I"&#xD;
He waited a moment; he gazed passionately&#xD;
upon the face of his brother; but no sign of con-&#xD;
sciousness woke on the countenance of the&#xD;
wounded man.&#xD;
"I would have slain myself!" he continued;&#xD;
"but Heaven knows that I dreamed not of taking&#xD;
thy life ,We both loved thee, signora. I de.&#xD;
spared and wished only to die I"&#xD;
She wrung her hands as she listened to him.&#xD;
"Wretch that I am, to cause thee even one&#xD;
tear! And now thou wilt shed many; but too&#xD;
many I"&#xD;
"Away I" she stammered, making a rapid&#xD;
gesture with her hands. He fancied that it was&#xD;
to forbid his approaching her.&#xD;
"Yes, you must fly I" muttered Torlogna, as&#xD;
he dragged him towards the door of the little inn.&#xD;
"Anna, farewell I"&#xD;
As he said this, she bent her head over the&#xD;
countenance of theapparently dying man, while&#xD;
her light and golden tresses, loosened in that&#xD;
moment of terror and agitation, swept her cheek.&#xD;
"Here are the gens d'armes I,, was jhoizted&#xD;
from the front of the hostelry, as Torlogna&#xD;
pushed him from the doorway.&#xD;
"She loves him. Yes; she loves him I,' was&#xD;
the stormy thought that swept through the brain&#xD;
of Guilio, as he leapt over the hedges, crushed&#xD;
through the tangled underwood, and climbed&#xD;
over the stone walls that bounded the vineyards&#xD;
with which the side of the Monte Pincio is cov-&#xD;
ered. The light from the fiery cupola of St.&#xD;
Peter's streamed over the country, like a second&#xD;
and morebleging day, as he fled, like amadman,&#xD;
from the spot on which he had steeped his hands&#xD;
in a brother's blood.&#xD;

Wa have now te retrace our steps. After&#xD;
Torlogns and the Brigni had borne the wounded&#xD;
Federigo to the palace of the Borghese in the&#xD;
banker's carriage, and he had conducted her&#xD;
home, she for the first time, in the secrecy of&#xD;
her own chamber, gave way to her anguish,&#xD;
which was not wholly unmingled with joy. It&#xD;
must be remembered that until this evening she&#xD;
had, very naturally, doubted the love of the&#xD;
yoting Castelli for her. His constant avoidance&#xD;
of her presence was unmistakable. How was it&#xD;
possible for her to suppose that lie had mistaken&#xD;
the attentions of the young Borghese to her for&#xD;
a love with which he doubted his own power to&#xD;
control I Now, all this was clear; but suppos-&#xD;
ing that Federigo should die-Guiio would have&#xD;
the weight of a brother's death upon his con-&#xD;
science; he would slay himself, or if not he&#xD;
would fly from the sunny shores of his own Italy&#xD;
to roam as a wanderer wherever his chiding&#xD;
soul might prompt him. What should she do I&#xD;
She wrung her hands with anguish. And yet he&#xD;
loved her; and as the Italian thought of this,&#xD;
her face brightened. She fell upon her knees,&#xD;
and the mingled prayers of her joy and sorrow&#xD;
climbed the steps of heaven, and smiled and&#xD;
wept before the throne of the Eternal Father.&#xD;
The next day Torlogna called on her. He&#xD;
had sent early to the ]3orghese palace, and had&#xD;
&#xD;
received front the old prince a favorable account&#xD;
of the young Borghese. The wound wac by no&#xD;
means a dangerous one--so, at least, said the&#xD;
physician. In less thafl~two weeks it was pro-&#xD;
bable that he might again be able to see his&#xD;
friends. They dared hope it.&#xD;
"And poor Guilio 5" asked the Brigni, as&#xD;
soon as he had paused.&#xD;
Torlogna looked inquisitively at her, and she&#xD;
flushed slightly as he did so.&#xD;
"In accordance with the request of Federigo&#xD;
himself, the prince will not pursue him," he con-&#xD;
tinned. "He is a noble young man.&#xD;
"He is," answered the Signora Anna.&#xD;
The Roman banker had been thinking of&#xD;
Federigo Borghese when he said this; but the&#xD;
Italian vocalist had thought of Guillo Castelli&#xD;
when she answered him.&#xD;
"Nay, when he has perfectly recovered,! am&#xD;
told that thu prince, urged by the prayers of&#xD;
Federigo, has promised not to pursue him. The&#xD;
Princess Borghese is ~' more bitter; but then&#xD;
she is a woman; of course, you know that is&#xD;
very natural."&#xD;
"0, of course I" w~s the answer which Anna&#xD;
Brigni had mad~'him.&#xD;
The banker stared. Old as he was, he was&#xD;
not altogether insensible to the charms of she&#xD;
fairer portion of creation, and the Brigni was&#xD;

obliged to request the presence of my female&#xD;
friend, Madame Salicetti, which I had imagined&#xD;

He bit his lips as she was speaking; but his&#xD;
face neither flushed nor changed color.&#xD;
"That must be ~s the signora herself may&#xD;
choose. If she wills it, she is at liberty to sum-&#xD;
mon her."&#xD;
Anna Brigni looked at him with astonishment.&#xD;
The change in his manner was so ~omplete.&#xD;
But a moment before his language had seemed&#xD;
to burn with youth and passion; now it was as&#xD;
cold and glacial as the ice in the higher Alps.&#xD;
"You do not choose me to address you in&#xD;
the language of love. Well, it shall be so. You&#xD;
must know what my feelings have been from the&#xD;
first moment in which my senses were entangled&#xD;
in the meshes of your loveliness. Itwould there-&#xD;
fore be useless to tell you all I have felt and suf-&#xD;
fered when I beheld yoalncOurtigilig another-"&#xD;
"Signor Della Torso !" interrupted Anna.&#xD;
"Let me speak, I pray you, mademoiselle!&#xD;
At your request, I forbear to shape my passion&#xD;
in the words itself might prompt; in the form&#xD;
that youferce it to assume, you must listen to&#xD;
it I"&#xD;
"muse, sir !" again commenced Anna, as she&#xD;
stretched out her hand to the little ivory handled&#xD;
bell that was lying upon the table. Della Torre&#xD;
rose and pushed it towards her.&#xD;
She sank backing her chair, and her eyes were&#xD;
fixed upon his. He laughed bitterly, and the&#xD;
sound of that Qminous laugh seemed as it were to&#xD;
congeal the blood in her veins; she could do&#xD;
nothing but listen to him.&#xD;
"I saw and knew that you loved Guillo Cuss-&#xD;
telli-"&#xD;
"Sir !" and the Brigni's eyes flashed as she&#xD;
rode in her seat.&#xD;
"I determined to poison his mind against you,~&#xD;
and to force you apart 1"&#xD;
She sank.back again in her chair, and at once&#xD;
determined to hear him to the end.&#xD;
"I threw in his way the night that he aceom-&#xD;
&#xD;
panned you here from the soiree at the Borghese&#xD;
palace, a note. He found it on the steps when&#xD;
he left your presence. It was addressed to you&#xD;
by the younger Borghese, and it had been open-&#xD;
ed. None else had entered the dwelling since&#xD;
you had crossed its threshold. That letter has&#xD;
had its effect !"&#xD;
"What frightful treachery to those who had&#xD;
never harmed you I" muttered the Brigni.&#xD;
He has murdered his brother !"&#xD;
"No! no! it is false !" she cried. "Torlogna&#xD;
has told me that he will recover&#xD;
"Torlogna has deceived himself. Should he&#xD;
die, Guillo Castelli must live as an outlaw, or&#xD;
fly from Italy- In either case he will be lost to&#xD;
you. Such has my love been l" he continued,&#xD;
with a sudden and fierce bun~t of passion, "and&#xD;
such it will he to the end! I adore you, Anna!&#xD;
You may never love me; hut never will I allow&#xD;
you to bless another with your love I Listen to&#xD;
me."~ And: he threw himself upon his knees be-&#xD;
fore her. "Only tell me that you will endeavor&#xD;
to return my passion; only tell me that you will&#xD;
allow me to kneel at your feet, to worship the&#xD;
ground you tread on, to&#xD;
"Never l" she exclaimed, as his hand touched&#xD;
hers and springing up, she threw it from her.&#xD;
"May the Holy Mary no mo're listen to my&#xD;
prayers, if ever I, willingly, hear you, or look&#xD;
upon your face. Go !"&#xD;
She pointed to the door with such an imperi-&#xD;
ous gesture, that he rose to his feet and involun-&#xD;
tarily receded towards it.&#xD;
"Go I"&#xD;
A malignant smile broke over his countenance&#xD;
as he stood there.&#xD;
"If it is to be war between~ us, the signora&#xD;
snay perchance remember hereafter that-she has&#xD;
in this moment broken her last chance of hap&#xD;
pines !"&#xD;
Before she had time to reply, Della Torre was&#xD;
already gone. What should Anna Brigni do I&#xD;
If she sent to Torlogna, who was the only friend&#xD;
of the two brothers, to tell him what had passed,&#xD;
she could not see him until nine-for at four&#xD;
o'clock he dined, and that evening thgre was a&#xD;
rehearsal of a new opera in which she was to&#xD;
appear on the succeeding night. She would at&#xD;

Salicetti, whose afternoon siesta was most un-&#xD;

THE ROMAN SOPRANO.                   41&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was somewhat late in the evening of the&#xD;
day succeeding that on which the lieutenant of&#xD;
Guiseppe Scarlatti had seen Federigo, that three&#xD;
figures might have been observed approaching&#xD;
the Borghese palace. The most remarkable of&#xD;
these was Andrea himself. His vigorous make,&#xD;
and the whole style of his tread; his heavy&#xD;
swing to and fro as he stepped on, and the un-&#xD;
usual style ~f his dress, might have convinced&#xD;
the chance looker-on that he was by no means&#xD;
of the straighter-laced denizens of that part of&#xD;
the world governed by the successors of St.&#xD;
Peter. His two companions were n young man,&#xD;
apparently, for the broad rim of his hat was&#xD;
slouched over his face, dressed in a short and&#xD;
wide gray capote, and an elderly woman bent&#xD;
almost double with age. She had hold of the&#xD;
arm of the young man, and had, apparently,&#xD;
much difficulty in supporting herself by means&#xD;
of a short stick, on which she bent heavily.&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" chuckled the old woman, half to&#xD;
herself, though partially addressing her compan-&#xD;
ion. "What a fool Andrea is !-ha! ha! ha!&#xD;
Some day or other when he enters Rome in this&#xD;
way-he! he!-they will pounce upon him; and&#xD;
although he is a Samson, he will be sent to the&#xD;
galleys."&#xD;
They had now arrived at the Borghese palace,&#xD;
and had entered the court-yard before the house,&#xD;
&#xD;
when a domestic in the livery of the family ad-&#xD;
vanced towards them.&#xD;
"Who are you wanting, my good people l"&#xD;
he asked.&#xD;
"Tell him, Andrea," said the old woman.&#xD;
"We wish to speak withllPrincipeFederigo/'&#xD;
"He is expecting you; follow ~&#xD;
The servant ascended the steps of the man-&#xD;
sion, passed the porter who was sitting within&#xD;
the hall, and turned to the left and ascended a&#xD;
winding staircase. They- followed 14; and&#xD;
Andrea's step as he 4id so, resounded through&#xD;
the hail.&#xD;
"Where it is," said the porter, wheezing&#xD;
through the fat of his capacious paunch, to get&#xD;
out the words, "that I have seen that scoun-&#xD;
drel, it would be impossible for me to say; but&#xD;
some day- or other I shall expect to hear of his&#xD;
presence in the galleys."&#xD;
It was, to say the least of it, somewhat strange&#xD;
that the old woman and the double-chinned por-&#xD;
ter should have so singularly coincided in their&#xD;
opinions regarding the ultimate fate of Andrea.&#xD;
Let us add, as we may never again have the op-&#xD;
portunity of doing so, that they were very cur-&#xD;
rect in their anticipations respecting it.&#xD;
In the meantime, the three individuals whom&#xD;
we have accompanied, had arrived at the ante-&#xD;
chamber to the apartment of the young Bee-&#xD;

so poor that he grew quarrelsome, and having&#xD;
some skill with the small-sword, wounded a&#xD;
Neapolitan nobleman in a brawl that took place&#xD;
in a gambling house. Nothing more was heard&#xD;
of him for three years. About that time, the&#xD;
nobleman he had wounded was travelling to-&#xD;
wards Rome. It was almost nightfall; but he&#xD;
was so near the gretr city that he haddetermined&#xD;
on not waiting until the following morning at the&#xD;
tarrying-place which he bad just quitted. His&#xD;
carriage was stopped, the traces cut, and a pistol&#xD;
held to his head. Re got out and was cars-led&#xD;
into the mountains. Five thousand scudi were&#xD;
asked for his ransom, and they were paid. The&#xD;
nobleman entered Rome, and a week afterwards&#xD;
it was heard throughout central and southern&#xD;
Italy that the broken-down gambler and extin-&#xD;
guished tenor was playing the part of Fra Di-&#xD;
avolo on a large scale in the Roman Campagna.&#xD;
Let us now return to the thread of our story.&#xD;
Guiseppe had smiled politely while Federigo&#xD;
was laughing; but no sooner had he terminated&#xD;
than he pointed to the table and requested Fede-&#xD;
rigo to rectify his mistake.&#xD;
"Let me assure you it is none," said the Bor-&#xD;
ghese.&#xD;
"You will excuse me, prince; but it is so,"&#xD;
responded the polite brigand, with a low bow.&#xD;
"But supposing that there was another service&#xD;
which, did you choose to undertake it, you could&#xD;
render me ?"&#xD;
"'Yoi~ see," muttered Andrea.&#xD;
"0, in that vase," answered Scarlatti, "I pre-&#xD;
sume that I might gratify you."&#xD;
"Well, there is."&#xD;
"Andrea, you can put that check in your&#xD;
pocket," said Scarlatti. Then he looked at Fed-&#xD;
erigo. "You pay handsomely, prince. One&#xD;
thousand scudi as an earnest-and-"&#xD;
He paused.&#xD;
"Two thousand more if you accomplish that&#xD;
which I wish I"&#xD;
"You see how a matter of business is arranged&#xD;
between two gentlemen) Andrea I" observed the&#xD;
captain, in the tone of a patron. Then he turned&#xD;
to the Borghese. "I accept the proposition!&#xD;
Now, what is it?"&#xD;
"Do you know the Signor Beruardo Della&#xD;
Torre ?"&#xD;
Guiseppe Scarlatti stArted, and turned roand&#xD;
with a fierce look at Andrea; but the look of&#xD;
astonishment visible~ in Andrea's face, at once&#xD;
re-assured him.&#xD;
"I see you do."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have heard of him," said the brigand.&#xD;
"You were in Rome the nighPbefore last. In&#xD;
the second street from the Aliberro you stopped&#xD;
a carriage. Della Torre was with you; he en-&#xD;
tered it, and you accompanied almost as far as&#xD;
the first post-house on the southern road that car-&#xD;
riage. There Della Torre and his unwilling&#xD;
companions dismounted-for there were two.&#xD;
The carriage returned to the first hostelry and&#xD;
baited there; it then returned to the city."&#xD;
Scarlatti stared at the young prince as he was&#xD;
speaking.&#xD;
"The cursed vetturino ought to have his throat'&#xD;
cat from one ear to the other !" muttered An-&#xD;
drea.&#xD;
Guilic laid his hand upon his brother's arm.&#xD;
"Who were in that carriage I" he asked.&#xD;
"You shall know all, Guillo-it belonged to&#xD;

"Accursed devil 3"&#xD;
"Signor Scarlatti," said the princes "if you&#xD;
can return that lady to ker friends, two thousand&#xD;
scudi more are at your service. Should you fail&#xD;
to do so, I pledge my honor to root out your nest&#xD;
of hornets from the Campagna, though my last&#xD;
zecchin were to be spent upon the attempt 3"&#xD;
Scarlatti laughed bitterly.&#xD;
"Your gloves must be thick and your mask&#xD;
stout, when you try to do so! However-come&#xD;
here, Andrea."&#xD;
He arose and walked to the window, while his&#xD;
lieutenant followed him.&#xD;
"And is this all true I" asked Castelli.&#xD;
And as his words escaped from him, his face&#xD;
was burning with the ~a~e that drowned his soul.&#xD;
"It is; the vetturino is now in this house.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
PFA T HER A ND S O N.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was with no little difficulty that Federigo&#xD;
prevailed npon their father to pardon Guilio.&#xD;
At first the old prince had absolutely refused to&#xD;
see him, and he even reproached Federigo for&#xD;
having permitted him to enter the palace. The&#xD;
younger Borghese, however, noticed that his pa-.&#xD;
rent did not chide him for having ransomed Gui-&#xD;
lio from the band of Scarlatti.&#xD;
" He is my son," replied the old man to the&#xD;
arguments of Federigo ; "but ought not that&#xD;
very acknowledgement of the rights he has upon&#xD;
my love, to have hindered him from staining&#xD;
his hands with a brother's blood 2"&#xD;
"It was but an accident-a mistake-an un-&#xD;
fortunate chance, my father. Guilio loves me."&#xD;
"An accident ! Yes, you have told me be-&#xD;
fore it was an accident. How can I believe&#xD;
you 2" -&#xD;
"You shall, and you must," ~replied the&#xD;
younger Borghese, as he drew aside the curtains,.&#xD;
of the bed and, showed the old prince his son.&#xD;
"See, he is here, my father ! Dare you add to&#xD;
the wrong which you have already done him-&#xD;
the greater one, because it strikes and bruises&#xD;
the very heart,-my father, of denying him your&#xD;
blessing 1,' And as he said this, he drew Cas-&#xD;
telli nearer to his parent.&#xD;
Tor a moment the aged prince hesitated ; he&#xD;
looked from one-to the other ; he traced his own&#xD;
&#xD;
youthful presence in each of those gallant boys,&#xD;
and all the father's blood stirred within his bo-&#xD;
som; he gazed upon the face of Guilio, and as -&#xD;
he did so, fancy brought back her whom he had&#xD;
wronged. Tears blinded the eyes of the .old&#xD;
man as he opened his arms to him.&#xD;
. " My son !" And Guilio was once more re-&#xD;
ceived into the family of the Borghese.&#xD;
That night, when Federigo and his brother&#xD;
were once more alone, Castelli turned to him&#xD;
after a long silence which neither of them had&#xD;
been willing to'break.&#xD;
" Tell me," said the young man, "tell me,&#xD;
my brother, why is it that you are so muh no-&#xD;
bler than I am 2"&#xD;
Federigo looked at him.&#xD;
" What are you dreaming of now, Guilio l,"&#xD;
'" It is no dream, Federigo !-it is but the sim-&#xD;
ple fact. I doubted you when you were all love&#xD;
for me-doubted you on the score of a letter&#xD;
which I had chanced to find, and which, had I&#xD;
shown it to yourself as I should have done,&#xD;
would in all probability have been traced to its&#xD;
writer. Then I shunned you; and when I&#xD;
.again met you in my momentary delirium I&#xD;
wounded you and fled. While, on the other&#xD;
hand, Federigo, it is to you, and you alone, I&#xD;
owe the summons which has called me back and&#xD;
reconciled me to the only one, save yourself&#xD;
&#xD;
' THE ROMAI&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
and Anna Blrigni, who has ever shown me affec-&#xD;
tion." '&#xD;
" And, my brother, shall I tell you what the&#xD;
reason of this is ?"&#xD;
" Yes." .&#xD;
"Simply, my poor boy, that you are in love,&#xD;
while I am not ; and in truth, if this indeed be&#xD;
love, I doubt much whether I ever have been or&#xD;
ever shall be. But I feel wearied, Guilio, and&#xD;
have need of rest." He rose from the chair on&#xD;
which he was sitting, us he said this. " Will&#xD;
you summon Giorgio 2"&#xD;
"Nay, to-night, Flederigo, let me supply the&#xD;
place of your servant."&#xD;
The younger Borghese smiled as he accepted&#xD;
his brother's assistance, and retired to rest. Gui-&#xD;
lio sat beside the bed as Federigo slept. A&#xD;
thousand strange and bitter thoughts were whirl-.&#xD;
ing through his brain-yet, singular as it was,&#xD;
his love seemed at peace. He was now convinced&#xD;
that the Brigni did not love Federigo-or, rather,&#xD;
he was confident that Federigo did not love her&#xD;
--and this, comforted him. That Bernardo&#xD;
would attempt-now that he had her so entirely&#xD;
in his power-every means to win her, he did&#xD;
not doubt ; but his -soul whispered to him that&#xD;
.she eared not for Della Torre. " She loves him&#xD;
not," he muttered, "andshe never will and never&#xD;
-          .&#xD;
&#xD;
N SOPRANO.                              45&#xD;
can love him.- Did she do so, I, myself, could&#xD;
forgive her for throwing her affections away&#xD;
upon one from whom she could expect no re-&#xD;
turn." Yet, as Guilio said this, the leaven of&#xD;
hatred arose within him. He clenched his hand,&#xD;
and rising to his feet, strode across the cham-&#xD;
ber ; he approached one of the lofty windows,&#xD;
and drew the curtain from before it, and the&#xD;
broad moonlight poured in a checkered stream&#xD;
along the marble floor, and as the cold yet bril-&#xD;
liant beam fell upon him, it stilled and calmed&#xD;
his heart ; he leaned upon the balustrade that&#xD;
protected the window from the- garden, and as&#xD;
he felt the cold wind of night sweeping across&#xD;
his brow, he leaned upon his hands and for the&#xD;
first time iu many days he wept ; but the tears&#xD;
that he shed were not tears of bitterness and&#xD;
sorrow-they were rather the drops that flow&#xD;
from the heart when it is relieved from the&#xD;
weight of anguish and despair which has so long&#xD;
been oppressing it ; he felt within his soul that&#xD;
his sorrow had passed away from him. Two&#xD;
weeks since, and he felt that he had been no&#xD;
more than a mere boy ; but a new birth had&#xD;
taken place within him; his past lifeggas now&#xD;
blotted out-the boy was dead, and Ill is place&#xD;
stood the conscious, bold and daring man.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE USE OF A LIEUTENANT-.&#xD;
&#xD;
ATlesgth the evening of the day following&#xD;
had arrived, and- Guilio-for whom Borghese's&#xD;
influence with the Pope had procured a ready&#xD;
pardon-.-quitted the side of his brother. Leave&#xD;
of absence had been granted him for a week,&#xD;
and in that time he hoped again to see her.&#xD;
"Farewell, Federigo I" he'had said. " I would&#xD;
not--nay, you know that Icould not-leave you,&#xD;
but--"'                            '&#xD;
" That she is in peril. Go, mio caro I"&#xD;
As Guilio pressed the hand of his brother, he&#xD;
murmured a blessing on him; the instant after-&#xD;
wards he was gone. '&#xD;
The evening service was chanting in the Sis-.&#xD;
tine Chapel as he entered it, and knelt in that&#xD;
wondrous place of. prayer. The mighty sibyls&#xD;
and glorious prophets of Michael Angelo stood&#xD;
out upon the walls and ceilings ; they seemed in&#xD;
the partial gloom that pervaded it, even grander&#xD;
and more august than they had ever before ap-&#xD;
peared to him. The magnificent processions,&#xD;
the beautiful groups of angels, the bold fore-&#xD;
shortenings, the determinate force with which&#xD;
each figure sbems to breathe upon the plaster,&#xD;
were revealed in the awe and grandeur of the&#xD;
gathering gloom to his adoring soul. Often had&#xD;
he stood there, hut never before had this start-&#xD;
ling sublimity seemed so wonderful to him as it&#xD;
41id now to that kneeling man. Before him, on&#xD;
&#xD;
the background of the chapel, was the greatest&#xD;
painting that dead or living artist has ever given.&#xD;
Like a marvellous jewel, set in that giant-world&#xD;
of art, stood out Angelo's Last Judgment. Christ&#xD;
stood upon the clouds, while from his mother,&#xD;
and the apostles gathered around him, rises the&#xD;
passionate prayer of the painter for the whole&#xD;
human race. The dead burst from the heavy&#xD;
gravestones under which they have for ages&#xD;
lain ; blessed spirits break from their cerements,&#xD;
and float upwards on the wings of their adora-&#xD;
tion, whilst beneath then yawns the bottomless&#xD;
abyss to seize its miserable victims. Despairing,&#xD;
they strike their brow with their clenched hands&#xD;
as they sink into its depths. With a strong and&#xD;
earnest hand has Angelo limaned in color that&#xD;
which Dante saw and sung. The most wondrous&#xD;
painter that the world has yet produced there&#xD;
asserts his right to stand in the might of his far-&#xD;
reaching spirit beside the greatest poet to whose&#xD;
breath man has ever listened-for Dante is the&#xD;
Isaiah of the lyre,.&#xD;
When Guilio at length arose, he felt that he&#xD;
was stronger The gorgeous inspiration had&#xD;
passed within him, and as he left the chapel,&#xD;
the gathering gloom of twilight fell around him,&#xD;
calm in the midst of that hope which was to&#xD;
him a prophecy. He mounted his horse, teased&#xD;
a coin to the boy who hel ,alloped down&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Rome.- Two hours afterwards he had reached&#xD;
the spot which Scarlatti had appointed.for their&#xD;
meeting. There was the Tiber, darkened by the,&#xD;
night ; the huge tomb, with its disjointed and'&#xD;
crumbling .masonry ; the low and shiny bank&#xD;
near it ; and around it, darkness and gloom, for&#xD;
aot yet had the moon arisen.&#xD;
Castelli dismounted. The bandit had not yet&#xD;
arrived. After throwing the bridle of his horse&#xD;
around the branch of an arbutus that had rooted&#xD;
itself between two of the fragments of fallen&#xD;
stone, he felt his way into the interior of the&#xD;
tomb. The burnt out brands of a fire, now nearly&#xD;
de ad, were smouldering upon the hearth, and by&#xD;
their still red light the whole interior of the&#xD;
tomb was visible. It was, what in the preceding&#xD;
ages might -have been a family burging-place.&#xD;
The low and narrow chamber in which he for the&#xD;
seconadime stood, was surrounded by two rows&#xD;
of small niches, and some were still covered over&#xD;
with mosaic, defaced, yet still. exquisitely beau-.&#xD;
tiful. From others, this covering was rudely&#xD;
broken away, whether for the sake of convenience&#xD;
,by its chance occupants or in the search for trea-&#xD;
sure, it would be impossible to say ; neverthe-&#xD;
less, they were very certainly in use now--for as&#xD;
Gulio cast his eyes upon them, he saw sundry&#xD;
bottles in one; in another was a, quarter of a&#xD;
sheep, recently killed, as it would appear ; and&#xD;
over the edge of a third, hung one of the com-&#xD;
mon sheep-skin coats worn by the Roman peas-.&#xD;
atry. The atmosphere Within the tomb was al-.&#xD;
most stifling, and he again merged into the air.&#xD;
As he did so,.the tramp of horses was heard.&#xD;
It paused almost close to him; he heard the&#xD;
click of a pistol-lock, and almost immediately&#xD;
after, a voice cried out :&#xD;
" Who's there ? Speak, or I fire ?"&#xD;
Guilio recognized the voice of Scarlatti.&#xD;
" It is l1-Guilio Castelli I" was his immediate&#xD;
answer$&#xD;
"You are punctual, signor, aud i am not,"&#xD;
said Guiseppe. " May I crave your pardon ?"&#xD;
As the brigand said this, Guilio heard the un-.&#xD;
mistakeable grin of Andrea. The rascal seemed&#xD;
to enjoy the unimpeachable politeness of his&#xD;
captain, who had, immediately after speaking,&#xD;
dismounted from .his steed. Scarlatti then ap-&#xD;
proached Guilio, and laid his hand upon the arm&#xD;
of the young man.&#xD;
" Come with me into the old bone-house,"&#xD;
he said. "I have mn eh to say to you."&#xD;
He then fe          a~to the interior of the&#xD;
&#xD;
tomb, and thrusting his hand into the interior&#xD;
of one of the niches, to which we have before&#xD;
alluded, he dragged out three or four pieces of&#xD;
dry pine, which he placed upon the smouldering&#xD;
embers before referred to. In a brief space, they&#xD;
burst into a blaze which illuminated the whold of&#xD;
that strange chamber ?&#xD;
"Do you yet know where she is ?" demanded&#xD;
Castelli,&#xD;
" Wait a moment, signor. All in good time,"&#xD;
answered the brigand, as he thrust' his hand into&#xD;
the niche in which the quarter of a sheep was&#xD;
lying, ands drew from it a huge pasty. '"I have&#xD;
just ridden twenty-seven miles, and have touched&#xD;
nothing since mid-day. You must have patience&#xD;
with a half starved man 1"&#xD;
Guilio fiung himself upon the groupd, impa-&#xD;
tiently, as Scarlatti drew a bottle end cup froln&#xD;
the other niche, and pushed them towards him.&#xD;
S"Will you drink, signor ?" he asked.&#xD;
Without answering him, Guilio took the cup&#xD;
and filled it. As for Scarlatti he was lost-in the&#xD;
enjoyment of his senses.&#xD;
The form of Andrea stood in the doorway of&#xD;
the tomb.&#xD;
"May I not enter, captain ?" he almost&#xD;
groaned, as he witnessed the huge inroads which&#xD;
were being made upon the contents of the pie.&#xD;
"No !" answered the brigand; "I am en-&#xD;
ga d."&#xD;
"But I am hungryy"&#xD;
"You will have to cook your supper," an-&#xD;
swered the'-chief, pointing with one hand to the&#xD;
mutton, as his other was still engaged in per-&#xD;
forming the duties of a fork.&#xD;
Andrea retired with a groan.&#xD;
" He! he ! he 1" laughed Scalratti, as he com-&#xD;
pleted his repast, and pushed the large platter,&#xD;
which was thoroughly empty, from him; "that&#xD;
fellow will never learn any respect for my dig-&#xD;
nityl"&#xD;
He stretched out his hand to the cup, which&#xD;
must have held move than a pint, filled it, and&#xD;
emptied it at 'a single draught. Re then took&#xD;
out a cigar, lit it, and extended another to Cas-&#xD;
telli.&#xD;
"Will the signor not smoke ?" he said, as he&#xD;
did so.&#xD;
" I thank you, not now," replied the young&#xD;
Roman.&#xD;
" Well, then, Let us to business."&#xD;
Guilio sat up opposite Scarlatti, who was lean-&#xD;
lug upon his elbow, in a half-recumbent posi-&#xD;
tion, est the other side of the fire. It was a&#xD;

&#xD;
THE ROMAN SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
strange scene, and might have afforded scope&#xD;
for a clever artist to embody it. The glimmering&#xD;
flame from the burning fire fell fitfully and bril-&#xD;
liantly upon the low roof of the tomb. Here it&#xD;
caught upo'n the flashing colors of a piece of&#xD;
mosaic that was half concealed by the shadow&#xD;
thrown front the body of the bandit, which was&#xD;
traced upon the wall in gigantic proportions.&#xD;
There it was lost in the darkness of one of the&#xD;
broken cavities, eazl here again it streamed&#xD;
through the doorway of the sepulchre uron the&#xD;
fallen stones, and the branches of the straggling&#xD;
shrubs waich grew without it.&#xD;
The face of Guiseppe Scarlatti, himself, caught&#xD;
the light more strongly upon its outlines than&#xD;
did any other object, and its singular and almost&#xD;
grotesque character might have induced one to&#xD;
believe that it was the carved image of an old&#xD;
faun, were it not for the roguish and malicious&#xD;
twinkle of the eye which played and flashed al-&#xD;
most incessantly, while the rest of the features&#xD;
were perfectly motionless.&#xD;
"I have not discovered where she is."&#xD;
"No !" cried Guillo, as he started to his feet;&#xD;
"then why did you not send to-"&#xD;
"Because that would have been useless, sig-&#xD;
nor. Sit down and listen to what I have to say."&#xD;
Guilio obeyed the imperative motion of Scar-&#xD;
latti's hand, as he continued:&#xD;
"It would he better, perhaps, that you sl%~1d&#xD;
hear it from the men who accompanied them.&#xD;
Shall I call them? They are without."&#xD;
"No," answered the Roman; "let me hear it&#xD;
from yourself. But at once, I implore you."&#xD;
The bandit smiled bitterly.&#xD;
"flow impatient love ever is !" he muttered;&#xD;
and then he went on. "At the post-house, a quar-&#xD;
ter of a mile ft-tim where he stopped, Della Torre&#xD;
procured another carriage. During his brief ab-&#xD;
sence the Signora Anna, and the old lady who&#xD;
had been stolen with her,-a very curious taste&#xD;
he must have to steal an old woman of sixty,"&#xD;
interjected Scarlatti,-" prayed and entreated&#xD;
my men to allow her to fly. She offered them&#xD;
her jewels, money-enough to make them rich&#xD;
ftir life-would they only permit her to escape."&#xD;
"Whydid they not do so?" passionately de-&#xD;
manded Castelli.&#xD;
"Because they had no orders from me to do&#xD;
so," answered the bandit; "because they knew&#xD;
that theirs would have been an extremely short&#xD;
shrift when I once knew it."&#xD;
He paused, as if for Castelli to answer him;&#xD;
but finding he did not, he continued speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
"When Della Torre returned with the carriage&#xD;
which he had procured, they were compelled to&#xD;
enter it; and for the first four miles, the men&#xD;
who rode beside it heard loud voices within.&#xD;
These by degrees died away, and all withiii the&#xD;
carriage was still and early on the following&#xD;
morning they arrived at Terracina. To the as-&#xD;
tonishment~ of Paulo,-for the other is a fool,&#xD;
and is never astonished at anything,-Della&#xD;
Torre and the ladies drove up to the principal&#xD;
hotel, and there he dismounted and inquired for&#xD;
rooms. Certainly, they could have a magnifi-&#xD;
cent parlor-all the parlors in a hotel are mag-&#xD;
nificent-and two chambers adjoining it. Della&#xD;
Torre handed the ladies out of the carriage, -&#xD;
paid my men the remainder of the sum which it&#xD;
had been stipulated he should give me for my&#xD;
assistance,~and then returned into the inn. Paulo&#xD;
and his companion went to an acquaintance of&#xD;
mine who does business for us, and there break-&#xD;
fasted. Poor fellows, a bottle of brandy had&#xD;
been all they had since seven on the preceding&#xD;
evening. Some two hours afterwards they again&#xD;
made up their minds to return. One of them&#xD;
thought it might be best to inquire whether&#xD;
Della Torre intended stopping there. It was&#xD;
Paulo, of course. Vou know that subsequent&#xD;
business, as indeed it proves now, might have&#xD;
required that knowledge. Paulo is essentially&#xD;
a man of the world; he ought to he my lieu-&#xD;
tenant; but mutele is a great advantage to au-&#xD;
thority, and so the Hercules, who is waiting for&#xD;
his supper, is. However, Della Torre was&#xD;
ready gone, and what is more singular, the two&#xD;
ladies had accompanied him. 'And on which&#xD;
road?' asked Paulo. The waiter was an old&#xD;
friend of his, and he had occasionally taken a&#xD;
purse or two; hut in a contemptible way. Be-&#xD;
ing a coward, he hesitated. Paulo slipped a&#xD;
scudi into his hand; the love of money overcame&#xD;
him, and he chuckled as he said, 'The road to&#xD;
Naples!' They immediately turned from the&#xD;
door of the betel, and presented themselves be-&#xD;
fore me this morning, having occasion to do a&#xD;
little business on their road which somewhat de-&#xD;
tained them."&#xD;
Guilio had listened to the details that Scarlatti&#xD;
had given him with amazement. What power&#xD;
could Bernardo so suddenly have acquired over&#xD;
Anna Brigni I What was it which could have&#xD;
induced her so suddenly to accompany him from&#xD;
Terracina? Did she-but, no that was abso-&#xD;
lutely impossible-at le so he fancied. He&#xD;
then looked at Scarlatti, a curiously&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROMAN SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
watching the change and emotion traced upon&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
"Well, what do you intend doing l" he asked.&#xD;
"The soprano would seem to have suddenly&#xD;
grown reconciled to the scoundrel. He, of&#xD;
course, must be the basso-bassi are always&#xD;
scoundrels," muttered the ex.vocalist. "Has&#xD;
my employment in this matter ended I"&#xD;
"By no means I"&#xD;
"I am glad to hear that," replied Scarlatti.&#xD;
"One cannot-'-skilful financier as one may be-&#xD;
every day manage to pick up two thousand&#xD;
scudi."&#xD;
"We will proceed to Terracina."&#xD;
"Most certainly, if you wish it."&#xD;
"And that instantly."&#xD;
"0, no, signor! We shall have to wait while&#xD;
our worthy lieutenant is refreshing his inner&#xD;
man. Besides, Paulo, and my namesake, Gui-&#xD;
seppe, are both excellent trenchermen. You will&#xD;
excuse their intrusion, I feel certain. I will take&#xD;
the liberty of calling them. Hallo, Andrea 1"&#xD;
"Well!" roared, rather than spoke, the fero-&#xD;
ciously hungry voice of Scarlatti's lieutenant.&#xD;
"You can enter if you will."&#xD;
Andrea rushed rather than strode into the&#xD;
tomb. He hounded towards the empty platter,&#xD;
seized it, looked into it, and groaned audibly.&#xD;
Paulo had sprung on the quarter of spring mut-&#xD;
ton, and had already commenced carving huge&#xD;
collops from it; the namesake of Scarlatti heap-&#xD;
ad more wood upon the fire. Andrea bent over&#xD;
it, and looking like a famished bear, commenced&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
cooking the steaks. Castelli felt oppressed by&#xD;
the dense and heavy atmosphere in the tomb-&#xD;
still more, perchance, by the bustle of so savage&#xD;
a life as that which he saw around him and he&#xD;
rose and stole opt into the open air.&#xD;
When, in half an hour, he again entered the&#xD;
tomb, Guiseppe was stretched nppn the floor&#xD;
sleeping, and the other three had finished the&#xD;
quarter of the sheep between them. Its bare&#xD;
bones were scattered upon the rough and uneven&#xD;
earth, which formed the floor of that rude chain-&#xD;
ber, and three or four emptied bottles were&#xD;
strewn upon the ground. They were engaged&#xD;
in drinking. Paulo, who, as far as Guilio could&#xD;
see by the light of the fire that had again burnt&#xD;
low, was a sensible-looking and handsome little&#xD;
rascal, with ~prodigiously broad shoulders, inti-&#xD;
mated to Andrea that he had better wake the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
Andrea complied with his request, and bend-&#xD;
ing over him laid his hand upon his shoulder.&#xD;
The latter yawned, stretched out his arms, swore&#xD;
a fierce oath or two, and rose. Then he saw&#xD;
the Roman gentleman standing near to him.&#xD;
With the bow and the smile of the man of the&#xD;
world, he murmured an apology, and led the&#xD;
way into the open air. In five minutes more,&#xD;
Gnilio's horse-to which Andrea had adminis-&#xD;
tered some of that mixed provender which is&#xD;

&#xD;
CC Guilio, is it you V' she murmured.&#xD;
Anna Brigni, beloved Anna, It is not !"&#xD;
She wrenched her fingers from that grasp, and&#xD;
fell back upon her seat. She covered her face&#xD;
with her hands as if to shut out the sight of him&#xD;
-for she had recognized that voice and knew&#xD;
she was in the power of Bernardo Della Torre.&#xD;
"Anna, you now see that my love is not light-&#xD;
ly to be shaken from you. Stung by your cold-&#xD;
ness, I determined that you should listen to 1110.&#xD;
In Rome you could close your doors upon me;&#xD;

She wrung her hands as she heard him; she&#xD;
did not answer him, for she could not speak.&#xD;
"You are a brigand, and a good-for-nothing&#xD;
wretch !" screamed Madame Salicetti, as she lis-&#xD;
tened to him. "Only to think that I at my age&#xD;
am exposed to such an outrage! If it had but&#xD;

"I !.-.-never 1"&#xD;
"If not at the present moment, to-morrow, or&#xD;

There was a bitterness in his voice, which van-&#xD;

"You have not answered me; nor do I desire&#xD;
that you should now do so. Remember that you&#xD;

"If you will not consent to this, I have but&#xD;
one recourse left. Thirteen miles from Terra.&#xD;
cina, there is a lone house. It stands apart from&#xD;
all others, and the nearest dwelling to it is at a&#xD;
distance of seven miles. It lies in the mountains,&#xD;
and thither shall I bear you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Wretch! villain l"screamed the old lady, as&#xD;
she listened to his threat.&#xD;
"'Madame," said Bernardo, "the choke will&#xD;
be In the hands of Signora Brigni. I will but&#xD;
follow her will."&#xD;
As he said this, once again he relapsed into&#xD;
silence; and shortly afterwards, one of his asso-&#xD;
clate~, in this most daring and thus far very sue-&#xD;
ceesful piece of villainy, rode up to the window&#xD;
of the carriage and addressed~him, us the driver&#xD;
stopped at some distance from a tolerably, bright&#xD;
light that was burning before him upon the road.&#xD;
"There is the post-house," he said.&#xD;
Della Torre immediately quitted the vehicle.&#xD;
"I presume," he said, as he stood by the side&#xD;
of the man who had addressed him, "that, yoft&#xD;
might possibly find some difficulty in procuring&#xD;
a conveyance 'I"&#xD;
"I should think so," answered the man, with&#xD;
a harsh sneer upon his thee, as he gently patted&#xD;
the neck of his horse. It was felt rather than&#xD;
seen by the I'iedmontcsc. "The only one that&#xD;
they ever let me have was never again returned&#xD;
to them. As for the body of the vetturiAo, why,&#xD;
that was found on the road between it and Ter-&#xD;
raclna, and a bloody cross Was drawn on its&#xD;
chest I" -&#xD;
Bernardo shuddered as he heard this cold-&#xD;
blooded confession; it grated confoundedly upon&#xD;
his nerves. As for the driver, he cowered and&#xD;
crouched upon his seat, as if he bad actually felt&#xD;
the edge of a knife drawn across his throat.&#xD;
"You most lend mc y6ur horse, then."&#xD;
"Certainly," said Paulo, who was the speaker;&#xD;
and as he uttered this, he dismounted.&#xD;
The Piedniontese sprung upon the animal,&#xD;
and striking it with his heel, bounded off in the&#xD;
direction of the post-house, while the bandit re'&#xD;
manned standing near the carriage, and under the&#xD;
~yes of Anna, who was barely able in that etn-&#xD;
certain gloom to trace his features.&#xD;
It has been already mentioned, that no sooner&#xD;
had Della Torre Left the spot, than Anna Brigni&#xD;
attempted to induce her captors by every bribe&#xD;
within her power, to permit her return to Rome;&#xD;
this was, however, useless. When Iernardo&#xD;
again appeared, she was o~$iged to quit the car'&#xD;
riage, and enter that which he had jsreceded&#xD;
back.&#xD;
They then continued their journey. Now,&#xD;
however, he had no necessity to complain tbal&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
AN UNExrEOTED RaCOGNITION.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was on the second morning after the details&#xD;
given in our last chapter, that a travelling car-&#xD;
riage was drawn up before the door of the hotel,&#xD;
called Cicero's Villa, in Mola di Gacta. A&#xD;
party of travellers, who had arrived there at&#xD;
noon on the preceding day, and had been com-&#xD;
pelled to remain there during the evening in con-&#xD;
sequence of the illness of the younger lady-a&#xD;
woman "bsl!a corn' en' angela," said the host,-&#xD;
were now about to proceed to Naples. Every-&#xD;
thing was correct. Anticipating that the Brigni&#xD;
would rather consent to travel on with him to&#xD;
the loveliest city in the world, as his sister, than&#xD;
remain a prisoner in the habitation to which he&#xD;
had proposed to take her, passports had been&#xD;
provided are hehad quitted home; Bribery will&#xD;
do anything in Papal or Neapolitan Italy. The&#xD;
only difficulty to a stranger is to measure its&#xD;
amount. Della Torre was a native of Genoa,&#xD;
and he had lived in Rome, conseq~iently he had&#xD;
not paid one scudi too much for what he wanted.&#xD;
At Terracina he had, moreover, taken advantage&#xD;
of their brief pause to provide a sufficient amount&#xD;
of baggage. At present, it is true, his rrunks&#xD;
were filled with hay; but what didthat matter?&#xD;
A liberal fee at the frontier of the kingdom of&#xD;
Naples had prevented their being opened, andat&#xD;

54                  THE ROMAN SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
But indescribably lovely as was the scene that&#xD;
lay stretched before her eyes, they were almost&#xD;
unconscious of its fairy beauty. Her thoug~$s&#xD;
were far away-they were with Guillo- Singular&#xD;
as it may seem, her sense instinctively felt-nay,&#xD;
it knew that the young Castelli had returned to&#xD;
Rome. And if it indeed were so, what must he&#xD;
~ow think of her? What was there that he&#xD;
would not he told of her? Should he see Tor.&#xD;
logna, what would not the wealthy banker im-&#xD;
pute to the vanished vocalist? And, moreover,1&#xD;
whit by any chance could he hear that would he&#xD;
worse for him to know, than the fact that she&#xD;
was travelling to Naples, under the care and&#xD;
with the assumed title of the sister of Bernardo&#xD;
Delia Torre. The name might be assunled;&#xD;
fbr a while it might hide her shame, but s~&amp;amp;iier&#xD;
or later it must. be known to him, and then&#xD;
where should she hide herself? Alas! she&#xD;
could but die.&#xD;
As these thoughts crossed her mind, Madame&#xD;
Salicetti rushed into her chamber. Annalooked&#xD;
at her with, such a woe-stricken expression of&#xD;
countenance that at any other time the old lady&#xD;
would have been terrified. Now she laughed,&#xD;
with the tears of her joy standing in her eyes.&#xD;
"Anna! mia figlia Anna! we shall not have&#xD;
to go on to Naples I" she cried' out; and she&#xD;
clapped her hands together as she said so.&#xD;
The Brigni still luoke4 at her without speak-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"0, it is true, my child Vengeance ~ias&#xD;
found him out. He had fancied he was to have&#xD;
it all his own way, the wretch 1"&#xD;
"What is it?" said Anna Brigni, risingto~r&#xD;
feet, as she spoke. At that moment the death of&#xD;
Bornardo would have caused her, no sorrow.&#xD;
"'Torture me not, but tell me I"&#xD;
"The villain has fallen 4own, and his leg is&#xD;
broken. How I wish it were his neck I', an-&#xD;
swered Madame Sailcetti.'&#xD;
Nevertheless, grieved as we are to record the&#xD;
fact) we are obliged to state that this, was a gross&#xD;
exaggeration of the elderly lady's. He had gene&#xD;
into the city-if, indeed, it is to be called' a city&#xD;
-'of Gaeta,,sn hour since, 'after leaving orders&#xD;
for everything to be in readiness for their de&#xD;
parture. Here a misfortune had befallen him-&#xD;
he had fallen and had severely sprained his an-&#xD;
kle; this, ladeedso severely that he was obliged&#xD;
to be borne home to the hotel in the carriage of&#xD;
a wealthy Englishman, who happened tobe pass-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing at the time when he had met with the acci-&#xD;
dent.&#xD;
Now it- so chanced that this Englishman had&#xD;
heard the hotel-keeper's report of the singular&#xD;
beauty of the Signor ]3ernardo'a sister, and,&#xD;
though "bella corn' un' angela" is an exceedingly&#xD;
common style of eulogy in that most hyperboli-&#xD;
cal of all climes-Italy being, like the greater&#xD;
portion of your travelling idlers, a great admirer&#xD;
of female loveliness, the Hon. Lumley Ferrers&#xD;
was extremely anxious to see her. The fact,&#xD;
too, that he had assisted her brother, gave him a&#xD;
pretext for gaining admission to her presence.&#xD;
He would take the liberty of visiting 'her and&#xD;
informing her of his accident. He accordingly&#xD;
committed his card to the charge of one of the&#xD;
waiters, and instructed him to rcrjuest the honor&#xD;
of an interview of a few momesiti with the sig.&#xD;
a&#xD;
nora.&#xD;
"Do you know him I" asked the Brigni of&#xD;
Madame Salicetti, showing her the card.&#xD;
"I believe," said the waiter, being very aux-&#xD;
ions to forestalLthe Hon. Mr. Lumley in his de.&#xD;
livery of the intelligence, and laying himself out&#xD;
to be questioned; "I believe i~hat he visits you,&#xD;
signora, at your brother's request."&#xD;
To his astonishment, no question was put to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"He wishes to inform you of tIed accident that&#xD;
has happened to the Signor Bernardo."&#xD;
"I suppose that we must see him, then."&#xD;
"Yes, you can admit him," said Madame Bali-&#xD;
cetti to the waiter, who stood near witlihis budget&#xD;
of news trembling on the tip of his tongue. Corn.&#xD;
pletely baffled, the mai~ withdrew from the apart.&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Now had he either s~i4 nothing, or chosen to&#xD;
say ~verytbing that he knew, it is more than&#xD;
probable that Anna Brigni would have declined&#xD;
l~eing intruded upon, and have entrusted him&#xD;
with a polite message to that effect. And had&#xD;
Anna I3rigni done so, it is barely possible that&#xD;
sheinight not have been discovered by the Sig-&#xD;
nor Castelli for many weeks. We merely men-&#xD;
tion this for the sake of proving to the readers&#xD;
that even a travelling linglishman and his inva-,&#xD;
riable curiosity may at times be converted by&#xD;
chance into an actual utility.&#xD;
TheHonorable Mr. I~umley Ferrers was ehown&#xD;
into the chamber by the domestic, who imme-&#xD;
diately quitted it. The Signora Brigni rose from&#xD;
her scat to receive him. Mr. Ferrers bowed and&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
THE DISCOVERY ARD THE TLIdIIT&#xD;
&#xD;
AT ten o'clock 6n the following morning, the&#xD;
~ carriage of Lumley Ferrers was waiting at the&#xD;
doorway of the hotel; and shortly after he led&#xD;
the Brigni and Madame Salicetti down the steps&#xD;
towards it They entered the carriage.&#xD;
"Do you not accompany us "" inquired'the&#xD;
elderly lady, as Lumley closed the door upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"I do, madame."&#xD;
"B~it howl" and she looked round as she ut-&#xD;
tered the question4 She saw a horse standing&#xD;
near the steps of the hoteL&#xD;
:Lumleypolnted towards it.&#xD;
"He is decidedly a gentleman," muttered the&#xD;
Salicetti; as she leaned back in the carriage.&#xD;
Anna Brigni bad partially recovered her spir-&#xD;
its, and as Ferrers had looked on her for the first&#xD;
moment as she took his arm at the door of her&#xD;
chamber to descend the staircase, he thought&#xD;
that he had rarely seen any one so beautiful.&#xD;
Her lair hair flashed in the morning light where&#xD;
it escaped fromher straw bonnet; her blue eyes&#xD;
swaxti with that mingled joy and fear which now&#xD;
filled her whole being; her cheeks were pale,&#xD;
but this onlyincreased the intellectual appear-&#xD;
ance of her head; and the Ihint smile that&#xD;
wreathed her rosy lips added an almost hale-&#xD;
~ctihable loveliness to her fltee As Lumley&#xD;

&#xD;
"I should like to know what the management&#xD;
of the Aliberto have done without you."&#xD;
"You should," questioned the Brigni.&#xD;
"Why, of course I should. What on earth&#xD;
can you be thinking of? Your absence must&#xD;
have rendered it impossible for them to have&#xD;
produced Cimarosa's new opera. I shouldn't&#xD;
be at all surprised if. the management were to&#xD;
bring an action against you for the. breach of&#xD;
your engagement. Damages would be very in-&#xD;
convenient. I feel certain that Issiac could not&#xD;
pay them."&#xD;
The name she had mentioned recalled the&#xD;
Brigni to herse~he remembered, and re-&#xD;
proached herself idferely as she did so, that for&#xD;
the last few days she had seemed completely to&#xD;
'have forgotten her second father. How much&#xD;
must he have suffered; how bitterly it must&#xD;
have cut him to the heart, to fancy that she had&#xD;
quitted him, without even a word or letter to&#xD;
bid him farewell. It was in vain that she now&#xD;
attempted to frame excuses for her forgetfulness&#xD;
of what be must have suffered. "I was his&#xD;
vbild-his only one," she murmured to herself;&#xD;
"and unheeding all his kindness, I have suffered&#xD;
say thoughts to be wrapped up in the love of an-&#xD;
other; not one memory of his kindness a~4tened&#xD;
is..say heart I~' She drew her veil mere closely&#xD;
urerher face and answered nothing to her corn-&#xD;
panion, whose tongue" was;still running o~s as&#xD;
rapldlyaa if her only occupation in life was that&#xD;
of~s~klng.&#xD;
It was early in the morning of the second day&#xD;
frosn~ this, that Guillo Castelli, with his three&#xD;
edatpamotis, arrived in Naplei. At Terracina,&#xD;
Seuxl~ttti aid the two brigands had left Guiio&#xD;
for halt s~ AJIQSW, while he breakfasted at the&#xD;
hotti.. Wl~eii. they returned to hint, but for the&#xD;
lierculeasi al~eef Andrea, he would have scarcely&#xD;
recognized his cornpas4ons.&#xD;
QulseppewaA shaven-all but hismoustache&#xD;
-and in his dres~ and peraQual appearance bore&#xD;
vs~y much the stamp of a stray tenor in search&#xD;
of an engagement. A tinge of the disreputable,&#xD;
it l~ true~ would have attaeJ~ed to hint; bui~ this&#xD;
by Re~ss~sans detracted from the one or the other&#xD;
of his profosiQlsAlcharacters. But for the bea~'d&#xD;
of Andrea, he might have seemed an liluglish&#xD;
prize-fighter, ~li~* had made a fortune in his&#xD;
ealiingand ba4transututed himseh, as he haag-&#xD;
ias4~4slto a ge*taezsan. Hishl4e coat and brass&#xD;
beittps~; his splendid vest; his embroidered&#xD;
shirt ~n4vnr~ dirty hands were typical of the&#xD;
class of life we have alluded to. Paulo looked&#xD;
&#xD;
indisputably the most distinguished of the three.&#xD;
He might have beeu taken as one of those law-&#xD;
yers who are to be found in all countries. In&#xD;
our own they maygenerally be discovered loung-&#xD;
ing about the Tombs: Castelli opened his eyes&#xD;
as they fell upon them.&#xD;
"You see, signor," said Scarlatti, "it might&#xD;
scarcely have suited you to have h~d~ us recog-&#xD;
nized. Hereafter it might have beele inconveni.&#xD;
eat to you. You might have been taken for one&#xD;
of us."&#xD;
Andrea grinned. He would have laughed, but&#xD;
Scarlatti had strictly forbidden his giving vent&#xD;
to his mirth. That roar would have been recog-&#xD;
nized wherever it had once been heard.&#xD;
"And now, whet have you done I Have you&#xD;
questioned the waiter ~" asked Guiseppe.&#xD;
"I have; but he was unable to tell me any-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"Or, probably, only unwilling."&#xD;
"I was about to request the presence of the&#xD;
landlord."&#xD;
"It is unnecessary."&#xD;
Scarlatti thought a moment, and then said to&#xD;
Paulo:&#xD;
"Go down and find out the waiter who told&#xD;
you they, had gone to Naples. Find out the&#xD;
name they were travelling by. Pay him ten&#xD;
scudi"&#xD;
As Paulo quitted the room, ho took out a lit.&#xD;
tie book. It was quite new. He entered 2the&#xD;
expense.&#xD;
"It is a necessary one," he observed to C~stelll.&#xD;
"Yes, yes," uttered the other, impatiently.&#xD;
"He may be useful again."&#xD;
It need scarcely be observed that Paulo was&#xD;
accustomed to the orders of his captain. He&#xD;
gave the waiter no mbre 4than two, It was a&#xD;
clear gain to Scarlatti of tight scttdi. Shortly&#xD;
after the brigand re-entered the apartment.&#xD;
"What have you discovered, Paulo ?"&#xD;
"They started for Naples, under the names of&#xD;
the Signor ai~dSignora Verami," was the reply.&#xD;
Guillo started.. A fierce and sudden gush of&#xD;
jealousy blazed through him.&#xD;
"The lady appeared entirely reconciled to&#xD;
him; he, himself, handed her into the carriage.&#xD;
The waiter knows nothing more.&#xD;
"We will at agee proceed, then," replied the&#xD;
'captain,-as he quitted the chamber. Guilio fol-&#xD;
lowed him.&#xD;
In five usispates more, Castel1i~ acc9nlj3anied&#xD;
by the three brigands, was galloping aleug~ the&#xD;
road to Naples. A qionsand bitter and passions&#xD;
&#xD;
ate thoughts were whirling through the brainof&#xD;
the young Roman. He could not believe that&#xD;
Anna Itrigni had, in truth, forgiven the crime of&#xD;
her abduction to Dellt~ Torre And yet when&#xD;
she was here-when she might so easily have&#xD;
spoken to the people of the hotel; when she&#xD;
could have demanded the assistance of the autho-&#xD;
rities-why h$ she not done so? Her silence&#xD;
made him suspect everything. If, indeed, ha&#xD;
should find that she loved another-if he were&#xD;
compelled by her owufree decision to resign her&#xD;
-then Della Torre.might take her; he would&#xD;
not trouble him. All he prayed for was, that&#xD;
never again might he be ensnared 'by female&#xD;
loveliness.&#xD;
It was in the earlymorning, as we have else-&#xD;
where stated, that theyarrived in ~1aples. They&#xD;
passed through Mola di Greta before dawn.&#xD;
Consequently they had not been able to make&#xD;
the same inquiries at Cicero's Villa which they&#xD;
had hitherto made at every hotel upon the road.&#xD;
The air was gray with the mist of early day&#xD;
when they came within sightof the city. Neither&#xD;
Vesuvius nor Capri was visible; but the corn&#xD;
stood juicy and green in the fields under the tell&#xD;
fruit2trees and poplars, round which the wanton&#xD;
vines twirled in hundreds of circling festoons nnd&#xD;
varied wreaths.&#xD;
"You must make our inquiries here, signo~"&#xD;
said Scariatti, pointing, as he spoke, to a guard-&#xD;
house. "I and Paulo are too well known to&#xD;
risk too close an inspection of our persons; and&#xD;
the talents of Andrea, though great in his own&#xD;
line of business, are scarcely sufficient to fit hint&#xD;
for the post of inquisitor-general, were it offered&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Castelli complied with the intimation, and&#xD;
rode towards the guard-house, as they entered&#xD;
the city. The splendid Toledo street lay before&#xD;
them. Tables, loaded with fruit, were standing&#xD;
before the doors of the smaller houses; hut, ex-&#xD;
cept the fruit vendors, who were preparing for&#xD;
their morning labors, there were few stirring in&#xD;
this portion of the city. Before a corner-house,&#xD;
the brands of a half-extinguished fire were scat-&#xD;
tered. Beside them lay two men, half naked.&#xD;
They were clad only in coarse linen drawers.&#xD;
Here Scarlatti paused to await the approach of&#xD;
the young Roman.&#xD;
"He is not in Naples," said Guilio, as he rein-&#xD;
ed in his horse at the spot where they stood.&#xD;
"Not in Naples I'! uttered Scarlatti.&#xD;
"He must be l'~ growled Andrea, with an&#xD;
ominous yawe.&#xD;
&#xD;
"We must have missed him by not pausing&#xD;
to inquire after him at Gacta," continued Castelli.&#xD;
"What do you now propose doing '*"&#xD;
"Should we not return to Gaeta, and at once I"&#xD;
"Decidedly," responded Scarlatil, as he swerv-&#xD;
ed his horee onee~gain round, to thQ entrance of&#xD;
the Toledo.&#xD;
"Look here," said Andrea, "I need an hour's&#xD;
rest, My horse and myself are alike worst out.&#xD;
The Signor Verami will not run away, if indeed&#xD;
he b~ there."&#xD;
"The Signor Veranti !" squeaked out a shrill&#xD;
voice, as the last words were spoken. "I should&#xD;
think notindecd."&#xD;
Theylooked round. One of the men we have&#xD;
noticed as lying on the ground beside the ses~sains&#xD;
of the fire, had partially risen. His long, and&#xD;
un8llorn hair fell about his swarthy brow, un-&#xD;
kempt and nncared for, while his keen, black&#xD;
eyes glared from the midst of its tangled locks&#xD;
with the look of a fox, who is e*cessivel.y hust-&#xD;
gry, and begins to scent a capon.&#xD;
"And what do you know about him, then ~"&#xD;
said Guiseppe, as his eyes fell' on the lazzarone.&#xD;
With a curious grin, the latter looked on the&#xD;
brigand- but as he did so, the smile faded u~t0,~n 2&#xD;
his countenance, and a look of the darkest a~&#xD;
mosivindictive hatred flashed over it. He leap.~&#xD;
ed to his feet.&#xD;
"Well, what have you to say?"&#xD;
"What will you give me I" inquired the nean~&#xD;
whose countenance had again relapsed into its&#xD;
usual apathy.&#xD;
Scarlatti had loosened his rein, and wsts pro-&#xD;
ceeding towards the city. Guilio followed him,&#xD;
and in another instant was riding beside him.&#xD;
"As soon as we reach the guard-house, dash&#xD;
forward !" whispered the brigand. "This fellow&#xD;
knows me."&#xD;
He then turned to the lazzarone.&#xD;
"Will a scudi pay you I" he asked, carelessly.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
Guiseppe turned on his horse and made a&#xD;
sign to Paulo, who* bent across to Andrea and&#xD;
whispered to him.&#xD;
The lazzarono saw it, and With a sudden&#xD;
spring laid his hand on the bridle of Scarlatti's&#xD;
horse; at the sante instant Guillo dashed his&#xD;
spu~s into the flanks of his horse, anfibonuded&#xD;
forward, followed by Andrea and Paulo.&#xD;
"Hal hal" shouted the lazzarone. "&#xD;
so, Guiseppe Searlatti, you are in Naples ag&#xD;
The sentry at the guard-house sfiw the Waggle&#xD;
and heard th~ cry. He rushed into the room&#xD;

where the soldiers were getting their soup and&#xD;
bread ready for their morning's meal.&#xD;
"Come outl-he is here I"&#xD;
"Who I"&#xD;
"Il diavolo Scarlatti I"&#xD;
~In another instant the brigand, who had dash.&#xD;
ed the lazzarone from him, was struggling to&#xD;
force his waythrough the guard. Guillo looked&#xD;
back; the instinct of a gentleman stirred within&#xD;
him; he had broken bread with Scarlatti; he&#xD;
could not thus leave him; he slackened his&#xD;
horse's pace.&#xD;
"What are you pausing foil" asked Paulo.&#xD;
"I cannot leave him I" was the short answer.&#xD;
"Nonsense I" roared Andrea, "you must! It&#xD;
was his own order."&#xD;
"But-"&#xD;
"Pahaw I-you will see him again, ere noon."&#xD;
"Should he-"&#xD;
"But I tell you he commanded us to accom-&#xD;
pany you. Did he not, Paulo I"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well; as you choose," replied Guilio, not,&#xD;
perhaps, altogether displeased to find that in pur-&#xD;
suing his journey back to Gauta he was but&#xD;
complying with Scarlatti's own wish.&#xD;
They were already within sight of the hotel&#xD;
which they had passed that morning before&#xD;
dawn, when Andrea's horse, which l~ad beentoil-&#xD;
ing heavily, fell undei~ him. A~the brigand&#xD;
fell with him, a fierce curse broke from his lips.&#xD;
"I knew it would come to this," he said, as&#xD;
he looked at the panting beast. "That cursed&#xD;
Scarlatti has no pity either for man or horse.&#xD;
What am I to do ~"&#xD;
"Provide yourself with au~ther, if it be Pos-&#xD;
sible, and then come on to the hotel."&#xD;
Castelli flung his purse upon the ground, and&#xD;
dashed up the street towards the doorway of the&#xD;
inn.&#xD;
&#xD;
TsezAandlord hastened to the entrance of&#xD;
Cicero's Villa, as Guilio Castelli dismounted&#xD;
from his steed; but the usual babble ot' a con-&#xD;
tineutal inn-keeper died upon his lips as he&#xD;
gazed upouthe young man. His attire, costly&#xD;
as it ~yae,~wus stained and fra$d with his rapid&#xD;
travel; a ghastly pallor sat upon his face; the&#xD;
close and matted curls of l4s~hair hung heavily&#xD;
athwart his brow-yet )n spite of the general&#xD;
disarray of his attire, there was something s~&#xD;
clearly evidenced in every movement that mark-&#xD;
ed the gentleman, as to impress the landlord,&#xD;
who, without~ uttering a word, bowed and fol-&#xD;
lowed him into the hall on the ground floor of&#xD;
the hoteL Here, Guiio paused.&#xD;
"I wish to speai with the landlord." '~&#xD;
"Hi-stands before you, excellenza."&#xD;
"Conduct me at once into your own room."&#xD;
The hotel-keeper opened his eyes. It was a&#xD;
traveller. Perhaps he wanted money. The&#xD;
landlordexamin~ed him. If~o, he had a valuable&#xD;
diamond pin in his cravat ihere was a watch-&#xD;
chain, too, hanging across, his waistcoat-of&#xD;
course, t~zere was a watch in it. With a low&#xD;
and cringing bqw, he conducted the young man&#xD;
te his sanetura.&#xD;
&#xD;
Castelli flung himself into a chair and exam~&#xD;
med the landlord, who remained standing. The&#xD;
latter was completely puzzled; his penetration,&#xD;
acute as it usually was, found itself at fault.&#xD;
The manner of his singular guest was ant at all&#xD;
that of a man who needed money. ~ fclt&#xD;
partially relieved.&#xD;
"Have you a stranger, who names himself the&#xD;

"Yes, excelleuza I"&#xD;

"No I" exclaimed the young Roman, impa~&#xD;
tiently. "Answer me tru~r, and believe me,&#xD;
that the information you may give me shall be&#xD;
well paid for."&#xD;
A rosy smile beamed over the round and oily&#xD;
face of him who rule~the spits and the warmnin~-&#xD;

longer believed that he required cash?&#xD;

which grated unpleasantly upon his nerves,  saw Guillo, he felt that he was in the presence&#xD;

"0, dear, no, excelleuza 1" was the reply. his animal instinct to repair the~wrong by the&#xD;

CIIAPTEI~ XVIII.&#xD;
THE TRANELLER OvEItTAKEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
WHEN Guilio had left the hotel, the fire that&#xD;
Della Torre had kindled within his bosom was&#xD;
still blazing. He noticed not the condition of&#xD;
his horse; he saw not that neither Andrea nor&#xD;
Paulo w~re waiting for him. Without a word&#xD;
to the obsequious hotel-keeper, who had 'descend-&#xD;
'ad the steps of the inn with -him; without be-&#xD;
stowing a coin upon the boy who had held his&#xD;
horse, he snatched the bridle from his hands,&#xD;
sprung upon its back, and striking it with his&#xD;
spurred heel, he swept up the road to Rome.&#xD;
"Why didn't he pay mu I" whimpered the&#xD;
boy.&#xD;
"Just catch me again trusting to a man's&#xD;
promise," muttered the host. "My intelligence&#xD;
was to be well paid for! Hang him! I believe&#xD;
that his excellenna is not worth a scudi !"&#xD;
The day wore on, and it drew near evening&#xD;
are Castelhi had passed the frontiers of Naples.&#xD;
Worn out by all which he had that day gone&#xD;
through the excitcmeut~pf the morning com-&#xD;
pletely blotted out in the deadening angui~h that&#xD;
mastered him as he thought that Anna Brigni&#xD;
was nd'w lost to him forever, he noticed not how&#xD;
greatly the animal which he was riding had suf-&#xD;
fered from the exertions which his master's will&#xD;
had forced upon him.&#xD;
For the seven or eighth time in almost as&#xD;
many minutes, l'e had raised his hand with the&#xD;
&#xD;
whip in it, to strike the jaded steed, when the&#xD;
sound of hoofs rapidly striking the ground be-&#xD;
hind him, caused him to tura his head. As he&#xD;
did so, a loud voice was heard: -&#xD;
"Hulk,, signor !" it cried; "but you ride fast.&#xD;
A pest upon it! but I had nearly ruined my&#xD;
animal in attempting to overtake you!"&#xD;
Guillo recognized the flexible accents of Gui-&#xD;
'I&#xD;

was riding beside hi~4&#xD;
"You are here, the~i7&#xD;

"~4id you manage to effect your escape I"&#xD;
"Hsi$re you killed Della Torre 'Z" -&#xD;
Suchwerethe first questions that broke from&#xD;
the two-we presume that we must not call&#xD;
them friends-acquaintances. Then Scarlatti&#xD;
looked at Guillo's horse.&#xD;
'ily the rood, signor I" he exclaimed; "but&#xD;
your animal is in a worse condition than mine is.&#xD;
The heavens be thanked that we are no more&#xD;
than' a mile from the next post-house; there we&#xD;
may find fresh h*ses."&#xD;
"How did you escape t" askel Guillo.&#xD;
"I had a little fighting fot' it. Blood ran,&#xD;
and I got a scratch in the fight we had#"&#xD;
answered the brigand, pointing to ~the -&#xD;

with which handkerchief that was bound around&#xD;
his left arm was crimsoned. "However, I got&#xD;
away; dined at a little cottage which I know,&#xD;
about half a mile from the main road, on the&#xD;
other side of Gaeta,,and am now here. I have&#xD;
told you my story, Signor; I now want to hear&#xD;
what you have done."&#xD;
In a few words Guillo told Scarletti what had&#xD;
passed between him and Della Torre. As he de-&#xD;
scribed the manasr in which he 'had hurled him&#xD;
to the other end of the apartment where he had&#xD;
found him, the bandit drew back and regarded&#xD;
the young Roman long and scrntinizingly.&#xD;
"Per Bacco! but it is singular," he said&#xD;
"what strength rage gIves a man.' I eduld have&#xD;
sworn that he was big enough to eat you for a&#xD;
meal, signor !-and yet you talk as coolly of&#xD;
having thrown him across the room, as I could&#xD;

~ese there is something in blood after all. Not&#xD;
that I have found it so," he muttered, with a&#xD;
jocular laugh. "But all men are not ~carlattis.&#xD;

hurrying along the road to Rome, in a fever of&#xD;
love and joy-"&#xD;
"Qf love and joy ~" answered Guillo.&#xD;
"Certainly; you will see the bela Brigni&#xD;
again, and-"&#xD;
"Never 1"&#xD;
Guiseppe cast a quick and piercing glance at&#xD;
the young m&amp;amp;n as he answered thus; then he&#xD;
-whistled, and looked up in the sky. Appar-&#xD;
ently, he did not find what he seal~ched for&#xD;
there, as he again bent his eyes upon Castdlli.&#xD;
"And why,-if I may take the liberty of ad-&#xD;
dressing you such a question.~-signor 2" were&#xD;
the words which he uttered after the lapse of a&#xD;
few moments.&#xD;
"Xiave I not told you all that he said of her&#xD;

~      "Whom t"&#xD;
"The Englishman-Lumley Ferrers."&#xD;
"You did."&#xD;
The young man was silent; he either could&#xD;
not or' would not speak. Guisdppe Scarlatti&#xD;
smiled.&#xD;
"And is this your only reason ?"&#xD;
"Is it not a sufficient one ~"&#xD;

A sudden light flashed across the mind of&#xD;
Castelli, and he reined in his steed. Searlatti&#xD;
did the same.&#xD;
"Itwas a lie-but no !-the landlord told use&#xD;

"And just as we were about to quit the stable,&#xD;

"The eighth of an inch taken off eacir of your&#xD;

"Perhaps so, and perhaps not," replied Paulo;&#xD;

very uncomfortably the while he was speaking-&#xD;

too much meaning to be very agreeable; "hut&#xD;

getic tone of voice, in which ass excuse is ordi'&#xD;
nearly couched. liesuddenly teased as he caught were those of the manager of the Aliberto.&#xD;
Pederigo's eye, which wat ftxe&amp;amp; upon him.   "Mademoiselle, 1 insist upon it. You must'&#xD;

"What, Prince Federigo "' asked the banker. you were ~tally nnknowu~ Yea bseak your en~&#xD;
&#xD;
gagement. I can reclaim the forfeiture attached&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
A faint murmur was heard in answer to this,&#xD;
but they could not detect the words.&#xD;
"0, just as you choose, mademoiselle, just as&#xD;
you choose. If you do uot choose to comply&#xD;
with my demands, I will have you arrested this&#xD;
very evening."&#xD;
"But I assure you, signor-"&#xD;
"I will not hear another word! Two nights&#xD;
hence you shall appear and sing for me through&#xD;
the remainder of my present season without a&#xD;
single scudi of salary, or else I shall be obliged&#xD;
to put you in prison for debt, on the score that&#xD;
you have wantonly broken your engagement."&#xD;
"What an infernal scoundrel I" said she ]3or-&#xD;
ghese.&#xD;
Torlogna caught him by the arm whiclr he&#xD;
was extending towards the handle of the door,&#xD;
and drew him gently back.&#xD;
"Let us hca~ her answer," he whispered.&#xD;
She spoke; but again the words could not be&#xD;
distinguished by them. The reply which was&#xD;
made her was audible enough.&#xD;
"I shall not think of waiting, mademoiselle!&#xD;
Make your choice, and at once !"&#xD;
This time they heard her answer very clearly.&#xD;
"Then, sir, I refuse !"&#xD;
"Very well, mademoiselle," was the answer.&#xD;
Is was accompanied by a coarse oath; then a&#xD;
heavy step was heard approaching the door. It&#xD;
swung open, and the manager bf the Aliberto&#xD;
stood in the presence of the prince and the Ro-&#xD;
man banker. As his eye caught those of Tor-&#xD;
logna, his whole face changed color, and he stag-&#xD;
gered back.&#xD;
"Villain I" cried the Borghese, as he hounded&#xD;
towards the Signora Brigni, who was leaning&#xD;
upon the back of a chair, very pale and very&#xD;
indignant.&#xD;
He caught her by the hand. Then he turned&#xD;
upon the cringing manager, and surveyed him&#xD;
with a look that might ha~e withered the un-&#xD;
fortunate man, could he have seen any one else&#xD;
than Torlogna.&#xD;
"What have you been saying to her who will&#xD;
soon be the bride of my brother, Guilio Cas-&#xD;
telli?"&#xD;
Anna Brigni uttered a short and sharp cry of&#xD;
joy, as she fell back fainting in the arms of&#xD;
Federigo.&#xD;
"So, sir," sai4 the hanker, "you were talk.&#xD;
ing of arresting tIre Signora Brigni ?"&#xD;
"I-really-I---did not know-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Unless she consented to sing for you the&#xD;
remainder of the season without a single scudi&#xD;
of sal~sry 1"&#xD;
The manager was very evidently in a dilemma.&#xD;
"Signor, exceilcuza, will you listen to me l"&#xD;
"No, sir-not to a single word I" was the harsh&#xD;
reply of Torlogna.&#xD;
"Let ~&#xD;
"To-morrow, at nine o'clock, you will repay&#xD;
me the sums that I advanced you at the com-&#xD;
mencement of the present season. If in half an&#xD;
hour afterwards the money is not in my hands,&#xD;
you will be arrested!"&#xD;
~' I implore the excelleuza-"&#xD;
"With interest, mind you! Be ready, or-"&#xD;
The manager fell on his knees.&#xD;
"You know the penalty."&#xD;
"Great Heaven, I shall be ruined !"&#xD;
"Of course-I 1~tend you to be !" replied&#xD;
Torlogna, as he turned his back upon him.&#xD;
The manager again arose to his feet, and at-&#xD;
tempted to address the wealthy banker.&#xD;
"Will you go? We would be alone," said&#xD;
Torlogna.&#xD;
Wailing like a child that has been subjected&#xD;
to the whip, the manager quitted the apartment.&#xD;
Pederigo had, meanwhile, laid Anna Brigni&#xD;
upon a couch at the further end of the chamber.&#xD;
He had then turned and rung the bell which&#xD;
stood on the table. As he did so, Madame Sa-&#xD;
licetti entered the room. Scarcely had she ap-&#xD;
proached the sufferer than she began slowly to&#xD;
recover. When her senses were at first restored&#xD;
to her, she looked round the chamber with a&#xD;
wandering and unsettled glance. Her eyes at&#xD;
length rested on Federigo.&#xD;
"You need be under no apprehension, sig-&#xD;
nora !" uttered the banker; "I have dismissed&#xD;
that vagabond "-this was uttered with the dig-&#xD;
nity of a man of money-" who has been mis-&#xD;
managing the Aliberso; he will not return to&#xD;
annoy you."&#xD;
"I thank you, signor."&#xD;
The Borghese then approached the sofa.&#xD;
"Did I-" She paused and fastened a mean-&#xD;
ing look upon the y~ung prince. "Did I hear&#xD;
you aright "' she asked.&#xD;
"I presume, Signora Anna, that you did."&#xD;
His tone more than his words convinced her&#xD;
that she had done so. A heavenly smile broke&#xD;
over her countenance as she listened to him.&#xD;
Federigo and Torlogna, both, thought that they&#xD;
had never seen her look more beautiful than she&#xD;
did then&#xD;

74                  THE ROMAN SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And where is Guiliol Why is he not here?"&#xD;
she asked.&#xD;
"He followed you on the track, which he had&#xD;
discovered, of your flight. He has not yet re-&#xD;
turned, signora."&#xD;
Again her face brightened, and even more visi-&#xD;
bly than it had before done. As Federigo mark-&#xD;
ed the play of those flexible and lovely features,&#xD;
he marvelled not at his brother's passion for her.&#xD;
"And have you forgiven hjm ?"&#xD;
"For what?" asked the young Roman.&#xD;
As she lifted her eyes to his noble face, and&#xD;
caught its pure and tender affection for his brother&#xD;
traced as if by the finger of its Maker in every&#xD;
line of it, she took his hand between both of hers,&#xD;
lifted it, and pressed her lips upon it.&#xD;
"Prince," she said, "you have a great heart I"&#xD;
Torlogna looked from one to the other blindly,&#xD;
like a man groping in th. dark. He compre-&#xD;
hended neither of them. The young prince's&#xD;
forgiveness of his brother would have been de-&#xD;
nounced by him as a sheer act of madness, had&#xD;
not he been a prince, and therefore one of Tor-&#xD;
logna's best friends. As for the kiss which Anna&#xD;
Brigni had imprinted on the young man's hand,&#xD;
he looked on it as neither more nor less than a&#xD;
confession of love. Probably he would have&#xD;
pitied Guilio had he paused to think about it.&#xD;
He was a man of money; nay, he could have&#xD;
told within, a hundred scudi what would be the&#xD;
amount of Federigo ]3orghese's fortune when Isis&#xD;
father should have received the last consolations&#xD;
of religion; but he took no note of his heart,&#xD;
Had he be*en asked whether the young prince&#xD;
had a soul, he would certainly have answered&#xD;
"Yes." A banker invariably recognizes all the&#xD;
dogmas of his religion. Who ever heard of a&#xD;
man of money that was a free thinker? But to&#xD;
divine what lay hidden within that soul-O, that&#xD;
was essentially a different thing!&#xD;
"But supposing that Guilio should meet with&#xD;
Della Torre ?" said the Brigni, and she again&#xD;
looked up at the prince.&#xD;
"He would probably shoot him; I should !"&#xD;
answered the Borghese, "with as little or less&#xD;
qualm of feeling than I should experience in&#xD;
spearing a wild boar, or shooting a wolf!"&#xD;
As he ended, the banker began to speak. Uere&#xD;
he was perfectly at home.&#xD;
"There would be no necessity for resorting to&#xD;
&#xD;
powder and bullet," he said, with an agreeable&#xD;
chuckle. "I have provided for that rascal. To-&#xD;
morrow I trust to have the pleasure of seeing&#xD;
him!"&#xD;
Federigo cast an inquiring glance upon the&#xD;
banker. The old Roman rubbed his hands to-&#xD;
gether, and chuckled to himself as ~e did so.&#xD;
"You do not know anything ab9ut it, I see;&#xD;
and, indeed, how should you? I never men-&#xD;
tioned a word on this score to any one except the&#xD;
police; they are confoundedly useful fellows.&#xD;
The rascal swindled me oat of ten thousand&#xD;
scudi; and did it, too, on the very day on which&#xD;
he ran away with the Brigni."&#xD;
The banker bowed to the signora as he said&#xD;
this.&#xD;
"The police got on his track through the pre-&#xD;
caution I invariably take of marking each new&#xD;
issue of notes differently. He had chanced to&#xD;
receive the cash in the first notes of my last issue.&#xD;
One of them came back to my cashier the day&#xD;
after he had quitted Rome. It was easily traced&#xD;
-it bad only passed. through two hands-to the&#xD;
landlord of the principal hotel in Terracina. My&#xD;
head clerk immediately went there and ques-&#xD;
tioned him. He l~ad changed it for the Signor&#xD;
Verami. Ha! ha! ha! that was the name he&#xD;
had taken. Rh, Signora Anna! Three of the&#xD;
Roman police were dispatched after him. Re&#xD;
had crossed the Neapolitan frontier. That caused&#xD;
a little delay; but I received a letter this morn-&#xD;
ing whiph announces that he will be here to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
"And what do you intend doing with him ?"&#xD;
asked the Signora Brigni.&#xD;
"That depends on his father."&#xD;
"How does it depend on him ?" inqs4red&#xD;
Federigo.&#xD;
"I wrote to the old Della Torre," replied the&#xD;
banker, "to ask whether he would make good&#xD;
the deficit that the scoundrel had caused in my&#xD;
cash-box. He answered me that since his son&#xD;
had thus disgraced himself, he might rot in the&#xD;
galleys! We shall see whether he changes his&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
"And if he should not ?"&#xD;
"lie will certainly try that style of life," said&#xD;
Torlogna.&#xD;
"Heaven be thanked for it !" uttered the Sn-&#xD;
licetti.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
&#xD;
A SEPARATION P11031 THE BANDITS.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was late at night, after the close of the same&#xD;
day, that Guilio Castelli rode into Rome. He&#xD;
was alone. With a praiseworthy regard for his&#xD;
personal safety, Scarlatti had separated from the&#xD;
young man in the Campagna, after intimating&#xD;
to him that he should, in all probability, pay&#xD;
him and Ii Principe Federigo a visit on the suc-&#xD;
ceeding evening, as he was exceedingly anxious&#xD;
-in fact he was astonished to find himself so&#xD;
anxious-to hear how matters might terminate&#xD;
between him and the Signora Anna.&#xD;
Castelli smiled-four hours since he could not&#xD;
have done so, as he thought that Scarlatal's in-&#xD;
teiest in his love depended upon the passion&#xD;
which the brigand entertained for the chance of&#xD;
getting the scudi which had not been earned.&#xD;
"Do not fear, Guiseppe !" he said. "You&#xD;
fihall be paid."&#xD;
"The signor is far too generous !" answered&#xD;
the bandit. "To take the money would be pick..&#xD;
ing the pocket of Milord Lumley Ferrers."&#xD;
"Very well. That, ns you choose !"&#xD;
"However, as I intended to have seized Mi-&#xD;
lord, on his return from Naples, and have missed&#xD;
&#xD;
him, through my fidelity to you, signor, I think&#xD;
I may reconcile my conscience to the scudi."&#xD;
As he galloped away, he said to Andrea, "It&#xD;
would be a pretty thing to have wasted three&#xD;
days, and not get paid for it."&#xD;
Federigo Borgbese had already retired to his&#xD;
chamber, as Guilio bounded up the stairs in the&#xD;
Borghese palace, and rushed into the apart.&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
The young prince looked round as he did so,&#xD;
and the brothers were once more together.&#xD;
"She is in Rortie, is she not, Federigo""&#xD;
"She is, my brother !"&#xD;
"Have you seen her ?"&#xD;
"Yes !"&#xD;
GtAlio gazed wistfully on the face of the&#xD;
young Borghese. He could not speak. A thou-&#xD;
sand questions werd trembling on his lips. But&#xD;
he knew not how to utter them. He longed to,&#xD;
know whether she had spoken of him; what she&#xD;
had said of him; how she looked when she heard'&#xD;
that he had followed her; whether she had'&#xD;
blushed when she listened to his name breathed&#xD;
by his brother's lips; in one word, he wislied4&#xD;

76                          THE ROMA]&#xD;
to know whether Anna Brigni really loved&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The Borghese wound his arm around Guillo&#xD;
and drew him beside him, upon the couch which&#xD;
stood between the two windows at the end of the&#xD;
apartment. "And have you, then, no more that&#xD;
you would ask me, my brother "'&#xD;
"Yes, Federigo I" The prince smiled on him&#xD;
as he listened to his tremulous accents. "You&#xD;
have mentioned me to her."&#xD;
"I have."&#xD;
"And, what? tell me, tell me all I" exclaimed&#xD;
Castelli, as he bent an imploring glance upon&#xD;
Federigo Borghese.&#xD;
"Everything?" asked his brother, with a tor-&#xD;
menting laugh; but, as he saw the pain which&#xD;
his manner caused Castelli, he continued, in a&#xD;
more serious strain, "Well, I will."&#xD;
He then told Guilio, what.our readers already&#xD;
know, together with much that had passed be-&#xD;
tween himself and Anna Brigni, after Torlogna&#xD;
had left them together.&#xD;
"Then you think that she loves me I"&#xD;
"Could you ever have doubted, Guilio, that&#xD;
she did 2"&#xD;
"Federigo, you have given me a new life."&#xD;
"And now let me ask you, what I deserve&#xD;
at your hands" While you were at Naples or&#xD;
Mola do Gaeta, or wherever else you were, J&#xD;
have avowed your passion, won you a wife, and,&#xD;
what was a much more diffleult thing, Guilio,&#xD;
have procured you the consent of our father to&#xD;
your marriage I"&#xD;
"What? Has he consented 2'~&#xD;
'~He has. But not without the greatest diffi-&#xD;
cuity. At first he said he would disown you,&#xD;
unless you consented to separate yourself from&#xD;
her. Itold him that this was impossible. Then&#xD;
he tbreatened to have you imprisoned in the&#xD;
castle of St. Angelo until you forgot her. I&#xD;
answered that you never would. He laughed,&#xD;
and said that.ehe could, at all events, forgetyou,&#xD;
before the first year was over."&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"I answered him, that, in that case, it was&#xD;
more than probable that I myself might wed&#xD;
her"&#xD;
For one moment a sudden flush of jealousy&#xD;
broke over the face of the young Castelli. But&#xD;
even as it did so it began as rapidly to fade&#xD;
rom It. "Forgive me, my own Federi~o !" he&#xD;
f&#xD;

N1 SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROM4~N SOPRANO.&#xD;
&#xD;
said, as he clasped his brother's hand, and pas-&#xD;
sionately pressed it in both of his.&#xD;
"He looked at me without speaking. 'I am&#xD;
perfectly serious,' I said to him. 'The Brigni&#xD;
is a noble creature, and she would honor the&#xD;
blood of theBorghese by consenting to an alli-&#xD;
ance with it.' He looked at me, gravely, and&#xD;
told me that the castle of St. Angelo might cure&#xD;
my madness, too. I laughed when he uttered&#xD;
this threat. 'The Brigni will not forget me,'&#xD;
Replied. 'She would want to have the chance&#xD;
of putting a coronet upon her brow."'&#xD;
"Federigo I" murmured the young Castelli,&#xD;
reproachfully.&#xD;
"'But do you not know that she is a Jewess?'&#xD;
he said, after a long pause, and raising his eyes&#xD;
to mine."&#xD;
"She is not I" cried Guilio.&#xD;
"So I told him. 'She is the daughter of the&#xD;
Signor Brigni, a learned professor of Bologna.'&#xD;
His brow relaxed as I said this."&#xD;
"No sooner had I discovered how deeply you&#xD;
loved her, than I sought out the Jew Isaac, and&#xD;
questioned him. You know that I despise the&#xD;
prejudices that exist against that race in our&#xD;
nation. But the old prince feels them, and feels&#xD;
them to their fullest extent. Had she been a&#xD;
Jewess, you must have respected his preju-&#xD;
dices, and have cancelled her image from your&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
Guillo sighed, as he listened to his brother's&#xD;
words. Then he raised his head, and looked&#xD;
firmly and fixedly at him. "It could not have&#xD;
been. Had she been a Jewess, I must have wed-&#xD;
ded her. Ay, though it had cost me his love;&#xD;
and, what I value far more, yours, my own Fed-&#xD;
erigo."&#xD;
As the young prince returned Castelli's look,&#xD;
a glance of affectionate pride filled his dark eyes.&#xD;
" You would have done right. What right has&#xD;
God given, even to the parent, that he should&#xD;
heap suffering upon a child; for the gratification&#xD;
of his own prejudice? There is little more lift&#xD;
for me to tell you. The prince ~tiU objected.&#xD;
Her profession was the stage. This weighed&#xD;
against her. As for yous:self, were you not a&#xD;
son of his house? He had always intended that&#xD;
you should marry well. In a word, he would&#xD;
have wedded you to some wealthy dowager, and&#xD;
have seen you settled in what he calls the 'great'&#xD;
worid. 'Prince,' I said, 'Guilic is my brother.&#xD;
You have more than enough for him and me."'&#xD;

hand.                                     him to the door of the chamber.&#xD;
"Suffice it," he continued, "that at length "Buena notte! mio caro I" were his last&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
LOVE-TUE WEDDING-THE END.&#xD;
&#xD;
LOVE, 50 says the Grecian fable, brought chaos&#xD;
into order, and created the world. Around ev-&#xD;
ery passionate and adoring heart, creation seems,&#xD;
as it were, renewed. And a truth is shadowed&#xD;
in that antique myth which reprints itself upon&#xD;
our daily life. At least, so it was with Anna&#xD;
Brigni and Guillo Castelli.&#xD;
It was the early morning, and he stood within&#xD;
her apartment. He was Waiting for the presence&#xD;
of.her whose love filled his whole b~ii~. The&#xD;
orange trees were breathing their fragrance&#xD;
through the open windows of the little room.&#xD;
What was' the perfume of their pale blossoms to&#xD;
that of the joy' which was filling his soul?&#xD;
Their leaves trembled in the rush of the sport-&#xD;
ive and wanton breeze that was playing through&#xD;
the street. What was that wavering tremulous-&#xD;
ness to the quivering hope that stirred within&#xD;
his bosom? What was the murmuring song of&#xD;
the breeze to that deeper and more spirinial&#xD;
chant of pleasure which was rising within his&#xD;
heart?&#xD;
At last she came.&#xD;
Trembling and blushing, Anna Brigni stood&#xD;
in the presence of her lover. Never had she&#xD;
seemed to him more beautiful. Her golden hair&#xD;
shimmered and flashed in the sun-light. Her&#xD;
eyelids with their long and dark lashes fell over&#xD;
her deep blue eyes, which seemed as for a mo-&#xD;
&#xD;
mont she had gazed upon him when she en-&#xD;
tered the apartment, swimming and dancing&#xD;
with the light of love. Her bosom heaved with&#xD;
the tumultuous tenderness which crowded out&#xD;
all other thoughts than those which owned his&#xD;
empire.&#xD;
"Anna 1,'&#xD;
When those tremulous accents fell upon her&#xD;
ears, earth seemed as if it danced around her.&#xD;
Love breathed its universal hymn of joy upon&#xD;
her ears. The very murmurs from the street&#xD;
without the windows seemed to join in shaping&#xD;
that song of love.&#xD;
With a short and gladsome cry she bounded&#xD;
towards him.&#xD;
"You love me, Anna ?"&#xD;
She sunk upon his bosom.&#xD;
In that embrace the young Roman forgot all&#xD;
of hispast doubts. He had not told her that he&#xD;
loved her, yet she knew and felt it in every por~&#xD;
tion, and in each pulse of her life. She had n~t&#xD;
answered him, but he could read her answer in&#xD;
her eyes. He drew it from her lips with his&#xD;
own.&#xD;
"I have loved you," said he, "from the first&#xD;
moment in which your sight filled me with a&#xD;
new life. You know, and you can feel, what an&#xD;
agony swept over me when, like a fool, I taught&#xD;
my soul to doubt you, for you too love. This&#xD;

Isaac, who was standing alone in a corner of the&#xD;
chapel.&#xD;
"May the heaven be thanked 1', he muttered&#xD;
to himself, "that I was sensible enough not to&#xD;
curse myself by a connection with one whose&#xD;
lips had ever been touched by-bak 1',&#xD;
He turned to the altar and gazel very fran.&#xD;
~zilly upon the remainder of the ceremony.&#xD;
The day after it had taken place the young&#xD;
prince announced to his father that he had ~.&#xD;
cepted the place of First Secretary to the Papal&#xD;
Legation in France.&#xD;
"My son, a Secretary of Legation! Never,&#xD;
boy I', was the angry answer that fell from the&#xD;
lips of the old Borghese.&#xD;
But Federigo had determined upon his course.&#xD;
He was anxious by a long absence to heal the&#xD;
wound which he had inflicted upon himself, and&#xD;
he so resolutely persisted in his determination&#xD;
thathe wrung a consent from his father.&#xD;
"Go, ~tben 1,' said the aged prince. "Go!&#xD;
Dance in the antechambers of a court; obey or-&#xD;
ders; wotk at the vocation you have chosen.&#xD;
But remember that you will be the first Bor.&#xD;
ghese who has ever done so. I would rather&#xD;
that you yourself had married theJBrigni."&#xD;
As he heard the last words of the prince, a&#xD;
sharp and sudden pang shot through the bosom&#xD;
of the young man. Would that have been im-&#xD;
possible l Perchance, had he imagined this he&#xD;
might not so readily have yielded up his love to&#xD;
Guillo's passion for her. Nay! he might. But,&#xD;
no! That pang confirmed his resolution.&#xD;
Two days afterwards he started for Rome.&#xD;
Anna-we had almost called her AnnaBrigni&#xD;
-remembered the tear which she had felt upon&#xD;
her cheek when his lips first touched her brow.&#xD;
Was it possible thathe too had loved her I She&#xD;
recalled the touching tenderness of manner which&#xD;
he had ever shown her. The more she reflected&#xD;
upon it, the more she was convinced that he&#xD;
had stifled his passion for Gulijo's. sake. One&#xD;
evening she was sitting alone with her husband.&#xD;
"Doyou know, Guillo, that you owe Federi.&#xD;

"Do I not ~we hin~ thee, my own soul I',&#xD;

He covered his eyes with his har~ds and wept,&#xD;

A week after Federigo received the following&#xD;
letter:&#xD;
"My own brother! my noble Federigo! You&#xD;
will be. astonished to receive this letter from me&#xD;
so speedily after your departure from us. -But&#xD;

word from you would have doomed me to a&#xD;
hopeless misery.&#xD;
"Had you chosen it, I might have been at this&#xD;

or a wretched captive in a Roman prison. My&#xD;
love would have . been hopeless. Never could&#xD;

THE MOORISH CAPTIVES.&#xD;
t~~t H. H. HEATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAITEI L I.&#xD;
If the Middle Ages were' dark, they were at&#xD;
the same time the epoch ot' romance. Arms&#xD;
Was the high profession of all nations5 and chiv-&#xD;
alry the soul of action. Love and conquest were&#xD;
the two reigning principles, and a meagre renown&#xD;
was that of the knight, who, though the hero of&#xD;
many a battle-field, had not ci"" won victories&#xD;
in the more rational and certe / more desira-&#xD;
ble contests of love.&#xD;
The time of which I write is one when Chris-&#xD;
tendom seemed to have spent much of its power,&#xD;
and the Baracen, Isy the awful strokes of his&#xD;
s~#srthyarms, had stretched his sway under the&#xD;
banner of the Crescent from the farthest East to&#xD;
the' pillars of Hercules. No~ only so, but he&#xD;
had stepped across the narrow barrier of sea,&#xD;
where Europe and Africa almost embrace each&#xD;
other at Gibraltar, and his nation had become&#xD;
seated in that fertile region of mountain and&#xD;
plain, of vineyard and wine, now the impotent&#xD;
powers of Spain and Portugal-then Lusitania&#xD;
~d Hispania.&#xD;
The decline of Rome-the world's proud mis-&#xD;
tress-had made way for the invasion of the&#xD;
Moors into those fair regions, and under the&#xD;
&#xD;
prophetic banner of Mahoinet the conquest be'&#xD;
came complete at the commencement of the&#xD;
eighth century. Spain was snhdued and passed&#xD;
under the submissive yoke of the Caliphs of&#xD;
Bagdad. The religion of the natives was that&#xD;
of the Holy Cross, and between the inhabitants&#xD;
who survived the Moorish conquest and the In-&#xD;
fidels, no species of toleration existed~ By the&#xD;
former the Saracen was considered Pagan, and&#xD;
by him the latter were termed barbarian. What&#xD;
comity could exist between such hostile elements't&#xD;
Here and there-.-'-tiow and then-th'e spirit of&#xD;
true chivalry broke through the brazen restraints&#xD;
of the national sects; and the wild schemes of&#xD;
the heart occasionally displayed occurrences&#xD;
forming strong contrasts with prevailing custom.&#xD;
Among the fugitives of Spain who escaped the&#xD;
slaughter of the last battle with the invading&#xD;
Moors, was the Irince Pelaglo; a noble and&#xD;
chivalrous descendant of the moderti kings of&#xD;
his country. his folloWers he led away into the&#xD;
northern portion of the kingdom. Prom the&#xD;
fastnesses of his mountain retreat, h'elagio stilt&#xD;
contended for the liberty of his country, and not&#xD;
unfrequently made victorious descents into the&#xD;
immediate province of the Moors.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was one of these occasions that gave rise&#xD;
to the circumstances which Will form the features&#xD;
of this story.&#xD;
Hoderigo de relagio was the eldest son of the&#xD;
rrince relagio-ayouth of high, martial spirit,&#xD;
and possessed of all those chivalric requisites&#xD;
which in his age at once characterized the sol-&#xD;
dier and courtier. Trained In the camp as well&#xD;
as the palace, Iloderigo combined in his nature&#xD;
much of the nobility of the Roman (for Spain&#xD;
being a Roman province, it was in the armies&#xD;
of home that he had fought); as well as the&#xD;
quick and haughty spirit so characteristic of his&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
Smarting under thc pains of submission, as&#xD;
his family was, and fully sympathizing with his&#xD;
father In the loss of his crown and country, Rod-&#xD;
erigo was never fonud wanting In respect to his&#xD;
appeals for vengeance; and if practicable, the&#xD;
restoration to him of those priceless jewels.&#xD;
Surrounded by his followers, therefore, the&#xD;
four seasons of each year were the signals for&#xD;
war with Roderigo as often as they approached.&#xD;
And many a time did the Moorish usurpers of&#xD;
his native Castilian valleys smart under the&#xD;
heavy5 blows and dreadful carnage which were&#xD;
dealt out by Roderigo and his soldiers as they&#xD;
rushed down from their fnstnesscs in the Canta-&#xD;
btiau mountains.&#xD;
The immense wealth brought from Afi~ica by&#xD;
the Moors made War on them in that day doubly&#xD;
desirable. The conquests of the East had filled&#xD;
the Moorish coffers not only with all the precious&#xD;
products of Eastern mines, but likewise rich&#xD;
fabrics and spices, and every desired luxury of&#xD;
the most enlightened nation of the world were&#xD;
to be found in the bazaars of merchants' of Spain&#xD;
~nher maritime cities, and in transit through the&#xD;
interior.&#xD;
Nor were these all the rich objects of capture;&#xD;
beauty, was also a prize. And how muebsoever&#xD;
we may at this day condemn such deeds, and the&#xD;
arguments that satisfied thosewho perform them,&#xD;
it is nevertheless true, that, as the nations of I&#xD;
Europe considered the Moors in the light of&#xD;
idolaters and pagans, no sin was conceived to be I&#xD;
committed in caPturing their beautiful daughters,&#xD;
and leading them home in triumph, either for&#xD;
pleasure or gain by ransom. The stimulus to a&#xD;
soldier's action, contained in the war-shout of&#xD;
"Beauty and Booty," is not one of modern date,&#xD;
but has been a potent lever in the art of war&#xD;
from the earliest ages. The Christian and the&#xD;
Barbarian have alike responded to that ignoble&#xD;
shout in all ages of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
The morning sun shone brightly over the long&#xD;
range of mountain peaks as the Castilian army&#xD;
under iloderigo were prepared once more to de.&#xD;
scend upon their enemies who had usurped their&#xD;
country. Never had the day-god ushered in more&#xD;
lovely spring boringg than that on which the&#xD;
gallant little army of the aspiring and patriotic&#xD;
youth was ab6ut to strike another blow for his&#xD;
family and captive country.&#xD;
The pure white flag with a cross in the centre,&#xD;
was the ensign of the proud house of Pelagio,&#xD;
and as it waved gracefully oYer the steel-clad&#xD;
warriors, a more charming sight could not have&#xD;
been desired.&#xD;
All was in readiness; but Roderigo waited for&#xD;
a parting word from his noble father ere he start-&#xD;
ed on his errand of war. Indeed, he desired&#xD;
once more to embrace his mother and, sisters,&#xD;
and receive their last blessing.&#xD;
At length the prince appeared mounted upon&#xD;
a black charger, surrounded by many nobles. who&#xD;
still clung to his cause and house.&#xD;
"I shall expect proud deeds of you, Roderi'&#xD;
go," said the prince, as he came near to his son,&#xD;
who, upon first discovering his father, at once&#xD;
advanced to meet him.&#xD;
"I shall expect proud deeds of you, my son,"&#xD;
repeated the father. "With these troops you&#xD;
can march into the heart of Castile, and humble&#xD;
the dastard African who now pollutes my&#xD;
throne."&#xD;
"What arms can do, these arms shall win;&#xD;
what bravery can accomplish, our deeds shall&#xD;
prove," was the noble answer of Rocierigo.&#xD;
"You have spoken like my son, Roderigo,"&#xD;
said the prince. "Go, and when thou return'&#xD;
est, come with a thousand trophies as thy spoil,&#xD;
and an hundred victories inscribed upon thy&#xD;
banner."&#xD;
"I obey, my lord; but where are inyrnother&#xD;
md my dear sisters ?"&#xD;
Theynre at handRoderigo, ~heerthee with&#xD;

The yearning of a mother when she sends a&#xD;

f he misgivings and sadness of sisters who witA&#xD;
tess the departure of their brother for the uncer-&#xD;

84                  THE MOORISH CAPTIVES4&#xD;
&#xD;
grasped his father's hand for the last time;&#xD;
flung himself upon his steed, waved his hand for&#xD;
the march; the trumpet sounded and the bright&#xD;
pennon, mailed soldier, and tramping war-horse,&#xD;
all moved onward and were soon lost to the view&#xD;
of those who were left behind.&#xD;
The march continued several days, during&#xD;
which period several skirmishes took place, in&#xD;
which the valiant young Spaniard and his follow-&#xD;
ers were victorious. their successes embolden-&#xD;
ed them to press still farther on, until they&#xD;
bearded the Moorish viceroy in his imperial seat&#xD;
at l3urgos.&#xD;
Inspired by the exalted thoughts and hopes&#xD;
of rescuing their beloved Castile from the grasp&#xD;
of the swarthy strangers of the South, Iloderigo&#xD;
marched forward until the tenth day at sunset-&#xD;
lug, when he found himself resting on a fertile&#xD;
mountain of the Castilian range, to the north-&#xD;
east of Burgos, where the usurper Abderahman&#xD;
now held his summer court.&#xD;
Upon this lovely spot the Castilian knight de-&#xD;
termined to halt, until a favorable opportunity&#xD;
presented itself of attacking the enemies of his&#xD;
race. From their encampment Roderigo and&#xD;
his followers might look down upon the ancient&#xD;
city at their feet, and hear at the same time the&#xD;
solejun chimes from the Moslem minarets at&#xD;
evening, and catch the sweet strains of the joy-&#xD;
ous ziraleet as they swelled out upon the clear&#xD;
air of approaching night. Such proximity to&#xD;
the Infidels as the Moors were termed, aroused&#xD;
the enthusiasm of the Spaniards to the fullest&#xD;
height, and it was with much difficulty that their&#xD;
commander was enabled to prevent them from at&#xD;
once rushing down Impetuously upon their ene-&#xD;
mies, who, as yet, were wholly unconscious of&#xD;
the presence of the Christian al-my.&#xD;
At length, when all became quiet, and the sol-&#xD;
diers reposed some in their tents, and others&#xD;
among the fair groves surrounding their bivouac,&#xD;
* Roderigo sumni~ed his lieutenants to his tent,&#xD;
for the purpose adjusting the course of pro-&#xD;
ceddings of the campaig~i.&#xD;
"Thus, my trusty friends," said Roderigo,&#xD;
"have we come Into the very heart of these In-&#xD;
fidels, scattering them wherever we have met&#xD;
them; It is for us now to turn our minds to the&#xD;
great task of dispersing this unholy band of&#xD;
- pirates from our native land, that we may re-in-&#xD;
herit it as justly belongs to us. Come, let us&#xD;
propose to ourselves some immediate course of&#xD;
action. What sayest thou, worthy knight be&#xD;
Dregauza?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"My lord, I am for descending upon these&#xD;
outcasts at early dawn, ore yet they have time to&#xD;
turn their dastard eyes toward accursed Mecca,&#xD;
Or utter their first prayer to their fiil~e god or&#xD;
prophet.'~&#xD;
these were the sentiments ~of a knight who&#xD;
had fought not a few campaigns with the legions&#xD;
of Home, from Thiton to the Euphrates; and&#xD;
aIthou~h they were uttered in a bold, rough and&#xD;
uncourtlike style, yet his words always had&#xD;
great weight ip the counsels, as well as his sword&#xD;
in the fight."&#xD;
Many were the plans submitted, when, at&#xD;
length, Roderigo condescended himself to pro'&#xD;
pose a measure.&#xD;
"My friends," he said, "as yet we are igno'&#xD;
rant of the forces of the Moors. Before any&#xD;
great result can be attained, it becomes necessary&#xD;
that we should possess this inforu1zation. To&#xD;
procure it, hazards must be run, and I, as your&#xD;
leader, will share them with you freely. Come,&#xD;
we will cast lots, and he upon whom it falls,&#xD;
shall this night, disguised as a Moor, penetrate&#xD;
within the walls of yonder city, discover the&#xD;
strength of Abderahman, and bring us word of&#xD;
all that he has learned."&#xD;
This proposition was hailed with pleasure,&#xD;
and every knight was emulous to accept the&#xD;
mission should it fall to his lot. Danger and&#xD;
skill prompted their brave hearts to dare the&#xD;
encounter.&#xD;
The lots were prepared, and one drew, and&#xD;
then another, and still another, yet no choice had&#xD;
been made~ Three others drew with like suc-&#xD;
cess. Then only three remained to decide the&#xD;
lot, and amOng these Roderigo himself was on9.&#xD;
The two remaining knights put forth their hands,&#xD;
trembling with hope, both drawing blanks. The&#xD;
lot had fallen on Roderigo, their captain.&#xD;
This result was as he had wished; for, hav-&#xD;
ing served in the army of Rome in Syria, he&#xD;
had gained not only a perfect knowledge of the&#xD;
Moorish language, buthad also become acquaint-&#xD;
ed with the customs and manners of the Moors.&#xD;
He was, then, not only properly fitted for the&#xD;
perilous enterprise by these important qualifica-&#xD;
tions, but his bravery was also equal to the&#xD;
emergency.                          -&#xD;
Iloderigo therefore arrayed himself at once in&#xD;
the habit of a poor mountain peasant, bade his&#xD;
friends good-night, and descended through a&#xD;
rugged pathway by moonlight toward the city,&#xD;
on his expedition of espionage.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
Abderahman, a successful soldier under the&#xD;
banner of the prophet, had risen from an hum-&#xD;
ble ~osidon to one of exalted power and splen-&#xD;
dor in the east; and after the conquest of Spain&#xD;
by the Moors, became the viceroy of that con-&#xD;
quered country. And whilst Cordova was se-&#xD;
lected as the seat of the Moorish empire in Eu-&#xD;
rope, yet were the palaces and court of the vice-&#xD;
roy situated and held in many different places.&#xD;
The time of which I am now writing finds Ab-&#xD;
derahman and all his attendant nobles, together&#xD;
with his royal family, in the city of Burgos, en-&#xD;
*der the eye of a Castilian army~&#xD;
It was a night of joy in this temporary Moor-&#xD;
ish capital The city was illumined, and music&#xD;
swelled out upen the evening quiet, like light&#xD;
gladdening darkness. Festivities of every ~le-&#xD;
scription were the delights of the senses, and the&#xD;
beautiful city seemed one of love and pleasure.&#xD;
Even the soldiery were permitted to disband for&#xD;
the occasion, so secure seemed all around.&#xD;
But what was the cause of all this excess of&#xD;
joy among the proud inhabitants of Burgos&#xD;
Why all this noise of mirth'~-these sounds of&#xD;
sweet music-these illuminated streets, this total&#xD;
abandonment of all order, discipline and caution&#xD;
It was the eve of the birthday of Abderabman's&#xD;
only chikl, Zulare.-'-the eve of the eighteenth&#xD;
birthday of the beautiful maiden ~nlare. Never&#xD;
had daystawned on morelovely daughter Nev-&#xD;
er had proud father greater reason to celebrate,&#xD;
with pomp and splendor, the anniversary of his&#xD;
child's birth.&#xD;
The palacee was thronged with myrhsds of&#xD;
those who had come to do the homage at the&#xD;
shrine of Zulare's beauty, and none went away&#xD;
without winning a smile from her~-a smile nev-&#xD;
er to be forgotten.&#xD;
Roderigo made his way to the city with all&#xD;
despatch. On arriving within the walls, he be-&#xD;
came Wonder-struck itt what he saw. Instead of&#xD;
an armed people, he beheld Joy and festivities&#xD;
reigning supreme. Indeed, he dared hardly&#xD;
credit his senses; but at last, not appreciating&#xD;
the full certainty of what was passing about him,&#xD;
he ventured to ask an old Ethiopian slave whom&#xD;
he met, what the occasion could be that produc-&#xD;
ed so much felicity in the city?&#xD;
"flost not know, my lord," he replied, "that&#xD;
this is the birthright of the viceroy's daughter,&#xD;
Zulare ?"&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed," rejoined the Castilian in disguise;&#xD;
"well, why do all the people thus partake of the&#xD;
enthusiasm?"&#xD;
"0 master, master, didst thouknow how very&#xD;
beautiful is the daughter of the governor, thou&#xD;
surely wouldst never ask me this ?" was the old&#xD;
man's reply.&#xD;
"Zulare Is then beautiful."&#xD;
"Beautiful as heaveu-hast thou never seen&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
"Nay, I have but now entered the city from&#xD;
a long journey; but I would fain witness those&#xD;
charms which cost a whole city so much pains."&#xD;
"I'll lead thee to the palace, master," said&#xD;
the slave.&#xD;
"First lead me to some well-filled bazaar,&#xD;
where I can change these unseemly garments,&#xD;
that I may make some- fair appearance in the&#xD;
presence of this princess of beauty."&#xD;
"Follow me, then, good master; I'll lead&#xD;
thee to one straightway in the very route to the&#xD;
palace~"&#xD;
"Thou art a good dog."&#xD;
"Nay, master, I am no dog; though the Span-&#xD;
iards call the Moors all dogs. I am no Moor."&#xD;
"Nay, thou art worse, being a Moor's slave."&#xD;
By this time the Ethiopian had brought Rode-&#xD;
rigo to the entrance of a large bazaar, such as&#xD;
is not seen in many countries at this day, but&#xD;
which, in earlier times, were the only marts for&#xD;
traflin.&#xD;
"Remain here until I come," said Roderigo&#xD;
to the slave. "I will go in and procure me&#xD;
vestments fitted for the occasion, and will then&#xD;
return, that you may lead me to the palace."&#xD;
Rederigo passed into the pavilion, where all&#xD;
was busy life, happiness and gayety. A short&#xD;
time sufficed to select a proper garb in which to&#xD;
array himself, and which, when donned, evinced&#xD;
by its richness and beauty that the wearer was&#xD;
no common personage.&#xD;
Reflecting upon the great risk of his under-&#xD;
taking, that of seeking an ent~ into the pal-&#xD;
ace of the very ruler whom liMed come to de-&#xD;
stroy, Roderigo deemed it best to assume afhar-&#xD;
acter as near that of his real one as practil~able,&#xD;
in order to avoid suspicion. It was with this&#xD;
consideration that he chose that of a prince of&#xD;
Gaul, the part which he so well knew how&#xD;
to act.&#xD;
It is unnecessary to describe the gorgeous&#xD;
richness of the apparel which Roderigo put upon&#xD;
himself in the bazaar. Those who are acquaint-&#xD;
ed with the costumes of that day will readily cost-&#xD;

ceive the noble appearance which Roderigo&#xD;
made; being a prince whose natural ~nd una-&#xD;
domed charms were sufficient to win their way&#xD;
to the deep recesses of admiration,&#xD;
Having therefore fully completed his toilet,&#xD;
Roderigo sallied forth from the bazaar, and fol-&#xD;
lowing the honest lead of the old African, soon&#xD;
found hims~tlf at the gate of the palace.&#xD;
The throngs were still pouring in and issuing&#xD;
from the vast enclosures, and it was with dliii-&#xD;
culty that our hero could effect an entrance into&#xD;
the palace. At length, however, he succeeded,&#xD;
and, bor~ie along with an irresistible tide pass-&#xD;
ing in, he soon found himself in a spacious sa-&#xD;
e loon most gorgeotisly lighted, richly adorned&#xD;
with all the splen4tirs that the East could have&#xD;
produced.&#xD;
Following the crowd onward, Iloderigo soon&#xD;
came into the vicinity of the circle of chief attrac-&#xD;
lion, and with an effort, disengaged himself from&#xD;
the throng, and withdrew to a more secluded&#xD;
position, but yet, where he might witness all that&#xD;
passed before his eyes.&#xD;
From this position, Roderigo could easily dis-&#xD;
tinguish the great Moor, Abderabman, as he&#xD;
sat upon his richly carved throne of ivory. But&#xD;
his eyes wandered for the inimitable loveliness&#xD;
of the viceroy's daughter-Zulare.&#xD;
Whilst thus engaged, an omeer of the house-&#xD;
hold came to him, saying thea his master having&#xD;
observed him, and perceived by his majestic ap-&#xD;
pearance and costly apparel that he must be of&#xD;
noble birth, desired him to approach the place&#xD;
where he sat in state.&#xD;
This was a compliment not particularly ac-&#xD;
ceptable to Roderigo, but well knowing the sus-&#xD;
picion thatwoeld inevitablyattach tohim if he de-&#xD;
clined so distinguished a mark of favor, he re-&#xD;
adjusted his dagger in his bosom, and suffered&#xD;
himself to be led to the 'foot of the throne.&#xD;
"I greet thee, noble stranger," said the great&#xD;
Moor, as R~4ujgo camei near to him; "thou&#xD;
art welcome Wur' court; and forasmuch as&#xD;
thou art a prince of Gaul, thou art doubly&#xD;
welcome."&#xD;
"I thank thee, my lord," answered Roderigo.&#xD;
"Thou art journeying through these regions,&#xD;
4oubsless, for thy pleasure; certainly no mission&#xD;
from thy nation bringeth thee into these remote&#xD;
s~onntries."&#xD;
"jt is most true, my lord, I am here upon my&#xD;
.~wn account, since I bring neither message nor&#xD;
Ji5~~tA of power with me."&#xD;
"MIeast thou shouldst have sent us word be-&#xD;

country."&#xD;
"Nay, my lord, no courier could have out-&#xD;
sped my course, so eager was I to arrive in time&#xD;
to participate in the pleasing fete now surround-&#xD;
ing me."&#xD;
"It is well, prince; the vigor of youthfulness&#xD;
snuffs beauty from afar, and seeks to honor it&#xD;
too, when found."&#xD;
"It is true, my lord; the fame of thy daugh-&#xD;
ter's beauty is not new to me, and it was to hon-&#xD;
or her that I have thus made my uncou*t~y&#xD;
presence before thect."&#xD;
"Thou hast not yet seen her, prince; tarry&#xD;
here one moment, she shall be brought hither?"&#xD;
Abderahman here nodded to an attendant,&#xD;
who stood near, and having heard the conversa-&#xD;
tion between his master and Roderigo, under-&#xD;
stood, consequently, ~the interpretation of the&#xD;
gesture.&#xD;
"Thou shalt see the loveincss of Spain, Afri-&#xD;
ca and Asia comprised into one human form,&#xD;
when thine eyes fall upon Zulare," said the&#xD;
proud governor.&#xD;
"I doubt it not, my lord," ansWered Roderigo;&#xD;
and before he had time to qualify his assent to&#xD;
the extravagant praise of the father, Zelaro ap-&#xD;
proached him, led by a Moorish cavalier, whose&#xD;
fierce countenance contrasted strongly with the&#xD;
sweet, smiling warmth that beamed from the&#xD;
unparalleled beauty of the maiden by his side.&#xD;
"Zulare, my child, look on the young prince&#xD;
of Gaul, who is here to honor thy birth-night."&#xD;
modest greeting of the viceroy's daughter with&#xD;
~Loderigo advanced a step and met the&#xD;
marked respect and admiration. He now led&#xD;
Zulare to a seat near by, where, in pleasant con-&#xD;
verse the hours flew with a rapidity of which&#xD;
the young pair were entirely ignorant.&#xD;
It was plain to be discovered, that although&#xD;
the young Spaniard had entered Castile to be-&#xD;
come a conqueror, he was now in a fair way to&#xD;
be con(luered in Castile. And though the fierce-&#xD;
ly flashing eyes of the dark Bajazet fell jealously&#xD;
upon the fair couple, they heeded it not.&#xD;
"How sayest thou, thou likes not Ihe Span-',&#xD;
iards ?" inquired Roderigo, after the conversa-&#xD;
tion turned upon that conquered race.&#xD;
"I like them not; they are too cruel; they&#xD;
come and kill our people, and carry far away&#xD;
our sisters and our mothers," was the artless&#xD;
response.&#xD;

I&#xD;

&#xD;
"I know little of them," said Roderigo; "bu&#xD;
have been informed they are a brave nation."&#xD;
"Yes, brave they are. I have heard my fath&#xD;
er speak of one Spanish prince whose name i&#xD;
Roderigo de Pelagio, who often comes into th~&#xD;
very heartof Castile with his armies.&#xD;
"Indeed I and has your father never punishe&#xD;
him for his tenterity l"&#xD;
"Nay; I have never yet heard of one victor~&#xD;
gained over him."&#xD;
"He must be an extraordinary warrior," sug&#xD;
tested the courtier.&#xD;
"0 yes; and is Ivithal, said to he a noble and&#xD;
beautiful prince."&#xD;
"Indeed," replied Roderigo, with some sur&#xD;
prize; "who could have given thee this strange&#xD;
information l"&#xD;
"An old Ethiopian slave whom my father&#xD;
purchased in Syria; he knew him when with the&#xD;
Roman army in the East," was Zulare's answer.&#xD;
"That must have been long since, as the&#xD;
knight De Pelagio I think has not been in the&#xD;
Roman service for many years."&#xD;
"Thou knowest the Spanish prince, then,"&#xD;
said the Moorish maiden, earnestly.&#xD;
"I knew him well, Zulare, when his father&#xD;
ruled this province under the Roman laws."&#xD;
Roderigo began to grow ~tless under the&#xD;
knowledge that there was a persoia~e of Ab-&#xD;
derahman's household who knew him, ~he~fear-&#xD;
ing lest hi~ incognito might be wrested fzom him,&#xD;
he was more particular to inquire who the slave&#xD;

he risked his present adventure. His surprise&#xD;
may be imagined when he learned that the old&#xD;
slave of whom Zulare spoke, was no other than&#xD;
h~ who had conducted Roderigo hither that very&#xD;
evening. He was certain that he had not then&#xD;
been recognized by old Nelsus, whose name he&#xD;
recognized as soon as Zulare named it. There&#xD;
was no certainty, however, that he would again&#xD;
escape the old man's recognition if he should&#xD;
once fairly set his gaze upon him; as, neither&#xD;
before they bad sought the bazaar, nor after-&#xD;
wards had an opportunity been afforded him to&#xD;
see the features of Roderigo. There was another&#xD;
reason why Roderigo deSired to know more of&#xD;

The night was wearing away rapidly, and as&#xD;
yet Roderigo had obtained no information of suf-&#xD;
ficient importance to warrant him in coming to&#xD;
any conclusion as to the course necessary to&#xD;
pursue. Old Nelsus had informed him that the&#xD;
whole Moorish armywere temporarily disbanded&#xD;

Whilst revolving these things in his mind,&#xD;
* Zulare pointed Roderigo to the old Ethiopian,&#xD;
who was at that moment advancing toward the&#xD;
place where they wei~e seated. He approached&#xD;
and finally passed them, without recognizing&#xD;
Roderigo, who now felt himself quite secure for&#xD;
the present.&#xD;
More than once had the jealous Bajazet wan-&#xD;

the entire period of their tete-a-tete, appeared to&#xD;
have enjoyed each other's Society to an unex-&#xD;

that the noble pair were muttial admirers; a&#xD;

"I have not, my lord; but__"&#xD;

"But, master, what dost thou here? thou&#xD;

"I want nothing, good Nelsus," was Rode-&#xD;

"I thank thee for this, good master," said the&#xD;
old Ethiopian, at the same time bowing until his&#xD;

thee again; I have not seen so much gold since&#xD;

knight, "give me the information which I desire;&#xD;

Old Nelsus then explained to Roderigo a se-&#xD;

as Roderigo pressed her soft hand to his lip, and si&#xD;

Hastening toward the northern suburbs of the e&#xD;
city, Roderigo found still waiting for him his o&#xD;
faithful servant with his horse.           a&#xD;
-      5&#xD;
The morning sun rose brightly over the city 1&#xD;
of Burgos. The third day of the carnival had '~&#xD;
arrived.&#xD;
*      *      *      *       *&#xD;
It was a busy day in the camp of Roderigoand&#xD;
his followers. Every preparation was now being I&#xD;
made for the premeditated attack upon the&#xD;
Moors within the city, and although Roderigo&#xD;
had intended to postpone the attack until at&#xD;
least the last night of the viceroy's fete, yet the I&#xD;
circumstances which had transpired on the pre-&#xD;
vious evening he was well aware must preclude&#xD;
any further intercourse with the city, evenshoul4&#xD;
Old Nelsus2not reveal the secret.&#xD;
Taking counsel, therefore, with his lieuten-&#xD;
ants, and particularly with Bragauza, Roderigo&#xD;
laid before them all his plans, the location of the&#xD;
city, the position of the palace, and to each com-&#xD;
mander gave express instructions as to his par-&#xD;
ticular duty. To Bragauza he assigned the at-&#xD;
tack on that part of the palace in which Abderah-&#xD;
man slept, whilst he would take under the charge&#xD;
of- his own eye the capture of the beautiful&#xD;
and loved Zulare.&#xD;
Thus were all things made in complete read-&#xD;

for the coming of night to strike a blow for love&#xD;
and Castile.&#xD;

The first shade of evening was slowly draw-&#xD;
ing its thin veil over the distant valleys, and the&#xD;
bright rays of the departing sun were disporting&#xD;
themselves like the phosphorescent glow of the&#xD;
ocean upon far-off Castilian peaks. The hour&#xD;
was fast approaching when the prayers of mil-&#xD;

plain, until as it were the sight was lost in dark-&#xD;
ness. They were then directed in a contrary di-&#xD;
rection-taking in the wide extended range of&#xD;
mountains to the north-eastward, upon which&#xD;
the light was just biddingits evening farewell.&#xD;

fi again-it was too true; the glittering armor&#xD;
f the Spaniards glistened on the distant moun-&#xD;
sin side, in the struggling rays of the sun's last&#xD;
getting moments. Too plainly she saw the&#xD;
engihened line of defiling troops winding its&#xD;
ray like a huge serpent, downwards to the plain&#xD;
elow.&#xD;
Calling one of her maidens, Zulare at once&#xD;
lespatched a message to her father, to apprize&#xD;
tim of his danger. The messenger reached him&#xD;
it the hour of prayer, and as the muezzin from&#xD;
ach turret called the faithful to their orisons,&#xD;
he trumpets of the enemy sounded under the&#xD;
kioslem walls of Burgos.&#xD;
From their prayers the Moors at once sprung&#xD;
~, the sabre and the conflict. The blood.red&#xD;
lag surmounted by a golden crescent was flung&#xD;
~ut from the loftiest battlements of the city's&#xD;
walls, and the war-cry of Mahomet was the ter-&#xD;
rific change from the low murmurs so recently.&#xD;
scattered prayerfully on the breeze of evening,&#xD;
and wafted toward the shrine of the faithful.&#xD;
The assault of the Spanish forces was tumul-&#xD;
tuous and skilful; the defence of the Moors was&#xD;
desperate and wild. The army, under Roderi-&#xD;
go, made no halt, and that of Abderahman&#xD;
sounded no parley. The battle began and rag-&#xD;
ed fiercely, at the same moment. From the fort-&#xD;
resses flew the javelins and arrows in tempes-&#xD;
tuous clouds. From the besiegers, the cata-&#xD;
pult discharged its ponderous stones, and on&#xD;
both sides the deadly sword performed its oft-&#xD;
repeated havoc. The clashing of steel against&#xD;
steel, the ponderous stroke on buckler and shield,&#xD;
made wild the music of the evening zephyr, and&#xD;
thousands fell beneath them to rise no more.&#xD;
The battle raged with utmost fury, while the&#xD;
last streak of light remained to gladden the eye,&#xD;
'or to direct the stroke, and so continued with&#xD;
hideous results, even into the darkness of the&#xD;
night, the moon refteing to shine on such a&#xD;
scene; deep, dark clouds usurping her sphere.&#xD;
At length, the Spaniards effected a breach in&#xD;
the wall. Thousands then rushed through the&#xD;
aperture. It was increased in size speedily, and&#xD;
in almost the space of time occupied in its nar-&#xD;
rution, Roderigo's forces had entered the city,&#xD;
in hand.to.httnd contest with the Moors.&#xD;
So well had Roderigo's lieutenants been in-&#xD;
structed in his scheme, that once within the&#xD;
walls, his entire forces pressed forward toward&#xD;
the palace. All was consternation within the&#xD;

battle, at least, in flight to secure his daughter.&#xD;
He therefore directed his steps toward~he palace,&#xD;
followed by his immediate guards arid officers.&#xD;
What heart can appreciate thu ~anguish of that&#xD;
father, when, on arriving at the palace, he heard&#xD;
the terrible news of his daughter's capture, and&#xD;
her conveyance away! The distant din of battle&#xD;
as it loudly resounded through those ancient&#xD;
palace walls, was all unheard by him. The full&#xD;
flush of his cheeks departed, and, statue-like, he&#xD;
stood as one amused at some awful event, with-&#xD;
out distinctly understanding its true character.&#xD;
*     This state was, however, but momentary.&#xD;
Gathering up all the energies of his natuv4, the&#xD;
vaultdd passages and apartments of the castle&#xD;
resounded with the awful imprecations upon the&#xD;
anthors of this misery from his lips; and then&#xD;
loudly calling upon his faithful guards surround-&#xD;
lug, to fallow him, Abderahman rushed away&#xD;
like a meteor in a dark sky, to renew the ter-&#xD;
rors of the battle.&#xD;
*              The horrors of the niglft became now doubly&#xD;
terrible, as the report spread wildly and fast&#xD;
among the Moslem ranks that the viceroy's&#xD;
daughter was made prisoner, and would, unless&#xD;
rescued, fall into the embraces of a barbarous&#xD;
prince whose religion was worse than that ol&#xD;
Paganism.&#xD;
Hour after hour the scene of frightful wai&#xD;
was visible in the ancient city, until the da~&#xD;
dawned again upon the surrounding plain. Ther&#xD;
what a' sight was there to be seen! The living&#xD;
Obtistian and Moor still engaged in terrific strife&#xD;
whilst the dead and dying Spaniard and Moslen&#xD;
lay in rugged heaps about the now ensanguinet&#xD;
streets.&#xD;
Bat this, like all desperate encounters, wa&#xD;
destined to have an end. The prowess of Rode&#xD;
rigo and~is troops had proved superior to the&#xD;
of the M6ors. It was whilst Roderigo was at&#xD;
gaged in what appeared to be the last desperate&#xD;
effort necessary to complete'~his victory, that h&#xD;
saw his chief antagonist approaching at the hea&#xD;
of his guard-the flower of the Moorish host.&#xD;
The quick eye of Abderabman at once caugl&#xD;
the towering form of Roderigo, and goaded on h&#xD;
despair and anguish, at once rushed forward&#xD;
encounter the young knight.&#xD;
Roderigo proved ready for the assault. ~&#xD;
pen can describe the angry contest which no&#xD;
ensued between the leaders of the opposing a&#xD;
mies. Even the battle around them seemed&#xD;
subside; both parties desiring to witness ti&#xD;
awful scene, as the fate of empire settled upe&#xD;
&#xD;
the points of those two terrible sabres. At Iest~&#xD;
the youthful vigor of Roderigo proved superior&#xD;
over both the age and skill of Abderabman, and&#xD;
the latter fell to the earth. Then it iVas that a&#xD;
terrific contest ensued between the two fractions&#xD;
of the armies, as to who should bear the fallen&#xD;
chief from the field. Roderigo's forces fought&#xD;
for a distinguished prisoner; Abderaliman's for&#xD;
preservation'from disgrace. Victory once more&#xD;
came to the Christian arms, and the Moslem&#xD;
crew fled in confusion before their Spanish foes..&#xD;
Thus closed th~ battle ofiBurgos. The vic-&#xD;
torious Roderigo now conveyed the fallen cap-.&#xD;
tive, Abderahmaii, under a heavy escort to a&#xD;
place of safety, and prepared at once to pro-&#xD;
claim the end of Moslem rule in Castile.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
Weeks passed by after the stirring events nar-&#xD;
rated in the preceding chapter, and the house of'&#xD;
Felaglo again held sway over its native Castile.&#xD;
Abderabman became a closely confined prisoner&#xD;
within the very city and palace where he had&#xD;
once ruled the undisputed master. Zulare was&#xD;
likewise a captive, but the rigor of captivity with&#xD;
her was relieveA by the warm love of Roderigo,&#xD;
as it was daily poured forth at the shrine of her&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
It is said, and with truth too, that love over-&#xD;
cometh aU scruples. The tender treatment re-&#xD;
ceived by Zulare from Roderigo, and those sur-&#xD;
rounding her, together with her former true&#xD;
feelings toward the young knight, all tended to&#xD;
I win the tender spirit of the maidenan4l inspire&#xD;
her to yield to the elevated desires of herloved&#xD;
s captor. One only request wasrejeeted. When&#xD;
she besought Roderigo to see her father, he&#xD;
t dared not yield. Too welihe knew the charac-&#xD;
L- ter of the true Moslem, such as Abderahman&#xD;
e was, to trust them with an interview, although as&#xD;
e often demanded by the father as sought for by&#xD;
d the dtiughter. Besides the dangers which threat-&#xD;
ened any communication between Zulare and her&#xD;
it father, the spiritual was not more to be dreaded&#xD;
y than the physical dangers to be feared.&#xD;
o From Zulare's first captivity, if it is to be so&#xD;
called, for it amounted hardly to restraint, she&#xD;
o had been assigned an holy priest, whose religious&#xD;
w zeal and true piety, in connexion with the holy&#xD;

a&#xD;
&#xD;
sage home. There were several ships at the&#xD;
Point, but they were all going arou$ to Ca~ton,~,&#xD;
and thus three weeks passed ~wity without any&#xD;
siga of the chance I sought. At length I learn-&#xD;
ed .that there was a Spanish brig downat Ran-&#xD;
gafalia which was bound for the Mediterranean,,&#xD;
and knowing that if I could be landed atjiibral-&#xD;
tar I could easily get a passage from thence, ~&#xD;
resolved to go down and see the captain of the&#xD;
brig. To this end I hired a boatman to take me&#xD;
down the river, and having got all my luggage&#xD;
together I set off. I found the brig anchored off&#xD;
the northern point of Sugar Island. Her cap-&#xD;
tain was a Spaniard, but spoke the English lan-&#xD;
guage well. He was a tall, pale looking man,&#xD;
with the strangest black eye I ever saw. It&#xD;
seemed to be a cold, icy eye, shooting forth sharp&#xD;
rays of light that possessed a sort of freezing&#xD;
power. I asked him if he was bound for the&#xD;
Mediterranean, and he told me yes. I then ask-&#xD;
ed him if he could give me a passage as fai~ as&#xD;
Gibrnlta't~, at the same time stating the circum-&#xD;
stances under which I had beenleft behind by my&#xD;
ship. At first he was unwilling to answer me.&#xD;
After thinking for a few moments he called some&#xD;
of his officers one side and conversed with them&#xD;
in a tone too low for me to hear; yet I cofild see&#xD;
that the discussion was quite animated, and that&#xD;
there were differences of opinion upon the sub.&#xD;
ject. At length the captain turned to me again&#xD;
"What is your name I" he asked, very coolly&#xD;
and at the same time eyeing me sharply.&#xD;
"John Barclay," returned I.           -&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Barclay, do you think you car&#xD;
keep a secret l"&#xD;
"I think I have followed the sea long enough&#xD;
to understand the value of such a trait as that,'&#xD;
returned I, without hesitation.&#xD;
"Well, then," returned he, "I will tell you&#xD;
that we sometimes lay ourselves liable to thi&#xD;
penalties of the revenue laws."&#xD;
"Smugglers," said I.&#xD;
"Yes-exactly," responded he, with a sort o&#xD;
cold smile about the corners of his mouth. "W&#xD;
do considerable in that line, and you must o&#xD;
course know that we wouldn't stop at any 01&#xD;
diary measures to secure ourselves against&#xD;
betrayal."&#xD;
I well knew the meaning of that~ remark-&#xD;
knew that my life would answer for my secrecy&#xD;
but I had determined to go, and I would n&#xD;
now be put back. I had laid too long already&#xD;
ujon my oars, and as there waS likely to be ~&#xD;
ether chance for some time to come, I resolve&#xD;
&#xD;
to take up with the present one at all hazards.&#xD;
If they could turn a penny by smuggling, and&#xD;
were willing to run all the risks, why, it was&#xD;
none of my business. They did not defraud me,&#xD;
or my government. So I told the captain I&#xD;
ould go with him, and pay him what was right.&#xD;
My luggage was accordingly brought on board,&#xD;
and I was allowed a berth in the cabin. I could&#xD;
see that there was some dissatisfaction on the&#xD;
part of the other officers, but they yielded to the&#xD;
decision of their commander.&#xD;
On the following morning the brig got under-&#xD;
weigh and passed out through the eastern chan-&#xD;
nel. She was a staunch craft, of about three&#xD;
hundred toTus burden, with raised quarter-deck,&#xD;
and with no house upon it. Her cabin was well-&#xD;
furnished and had six berths,-the captain and&#xD;
three of his officers took up four of them; I&#xD;
took the fifth, and the sixth was unoccupied.&#xD;
The brig's crew consisted of about forty men,&#xD;
more than half of whom came on board after I&#xD;
had taken my berth. They were stout, rough&#xD;
looking fellows, though they would compare well&#xD;
with the average~ of ships' crews. The captain's&#xD;
name I found to be Modiego, and I never before,&#xD;
nor have I since, witnessed such perfect disci-&#xD;
pline as there was on board that brig. Modiego&#xD;
* could speak with his eyes, and I never saw a&#xD;
* man disobey them.&#xD;
On the third day out I found that some of the&#xD;
crew were making arrangements to set up the&#xD;
cook's range in the fore-peak, and after the cu-&#xD;
linary implements were all removed thither, the&#xD;
galley, which had been standing amidships, was&#xD;
taken to pieces. This movement was of course&#xD;
strange to me, but there was a stranger scene in&#xD;
store. This galley had a floor to it, and when&#xD;
this floor was removed 1 saw a circular railway&#xD;
of iron, in the centre of which was a massive&#xD;
steel pivot. Once or twice I found Modiego's&#xD;
eye fixed searchingly upon me, but if he thought&#xD;
to read my emotions in my face he was much&#xD;
*f mistaken, for few men possess more control over&#xD;
a their features than I do. Yet I was glad that I&#xD;
f had noticed the captain's look, for it placed me&#xD;
on my guard.&#xD;
it After the deck was cleared of the last vestige&#xD;
of the galley, sheers were rigged over the main&#xD;
.1 hatch, and in half an~hour afterwards a long,&#xD;
heavy Ikass gun had been hoisted out frora the&#xD;
)t hold and placed upon the afore-mentioned pivot.&#xD;
y "We smugglers need something for protee-&#xD;
0 tion," quietly reniarked the captain, as he ap-&#xD;
d preached me after the gun was rigged.&#xD;
&#xD;
"0, certainly," said I, with a smile. "I&#xD;
wondered before that I saw no implements for&#xD;
such. a purpose."&#xD;
Modiego gave me a. searching look, but he&#xD;
found nothing but honesty in my countenance.&#xD;
"Yes," he uttered, "we are obliged to be pre-&#xD;
pared for emergencies, for our'a is a dangerous&#xD;
business."&#xD;
I believed him! And I began., to wish that I&#xD;
had not been in quite so much of a hurry to se-&#xD;
cure my passage. But it was too late now-I&#xD;
had forced myself into the plight, and Ihad only&#xD;
to make the best of it. Of course I had begun&#xD;
to think that my companions were men who&#xD;
smuggled at both ends of the bargain-that the&#xD;
revenue was not the only institution against&#xD;
which their hands were raised.&#xD;
For fourteen days the brig kept on her course&#xD;
to the south'rd and west'rd, and dui~ing.that time&#xD;
I had been on very fair terms with the officers,&#xD;
though none of them beesned inclined to famil-&#xD;
iarity. Once or twice I thought the captain&#xD;
seemed inclined to make some overture to me,&#xD;
but whatever may have been upon his mind he&#xD;
kept itto himself. On~hemorningofthefifteenth&#xD;
day I heard an unusual bustle upon deck, and&#xD;
on going up I found that the tarpaulin had been&#xD;
taken from the long gun, and that the men were&#xD;
bringing small arms up from below. Modiego&#xD;
was at the starboard rail with his telescope to his&#xD;
eye. I looked in the direction indicated by his&#xD;
glass a~d saw a ship not more than four or five&#xD;
miles distant. She was evidently a merehans-&#xD;
man, and bound up the ocean. Modiego at&#xD;
length lowered his glass, and as he turned he&#xD;
saw me.&#xD;
"~Al~-Mr. barclay," he said, showing not&#xD;
the leapt hesitation, "you had better go below,&#xD;
for we are likely to have business that may not&#xD;
be agreeable to you."&#xD;
This order was not to be mistaken, and sim-&#xD;
ply bowing an acquiescence, I turned and went&#xD;
back to the cabin. I will not attempt to tell&#xD;
what were my feelings at that moment. Of&#xD;
course I knew now that I bad taken passage in&#xD;
a pirate, and I ouly wondered that I had been&#xD;
allowed so so do; but I subsequently learned,&#xD;
from a conversation that I overheard, that Mo-&#xD;
diego had allowed me to remain on board through&#xD;
fear that I might be the meanS of exciting sus-&#xD;
picion against him' if he sent me off. It seemed&#xD;
that he feared that if I told the officers on shore&#xD;
of his refusal to take me, that it might, in some&#xD;
way, subject him to an examination, at least.&#xD;
&#xD;
So he thought it best to take me, and, if I was&#xD;
Jikelyrto pro~ei~dangerous passenger, to dispose&#xD;
ofmeinamethod c - toindividuala of&#xD;
their profession.&#xD;
When I reached tire cabin I seatedmyself near&#xD;
tl~e ~W'le and itwaited the result. My feelings&#xD;
were~4~ious and changing. I had sorrow, die-&#xD;
hppointment, regret, and anger, though I think&#xD;
that the latter emotion was the most prominent.&#xD;
In fifteen minutes I felt the shock of our long&#xD;
gun. Then itboomedagain-.-and again. Then&#xD;
I heard the~voice of Captain Modiego ashe call-&#xD;
ed away his boarders; All was now bustle over&#xD;
my head. I heard the rattle of the small arms&#xD;
as they were being distributed, and the clanking&#xD;
of the grappling chains as they were dragged&#xD;
over the deck. Next I felt a shock that came&#xD;
nigh throwing me from my seat-and fluew&#xD;
that the vessels had come together. ~[ expected&#xD;
to have heard loud, fiendish yells of onset, but&#xD;
in this I was mistaken. I heard Modiego give&#xD;
the order for boarding, and then I heard the&#xD;
sharp cracking of musketry. Now my blood&#xD;
was up, and at the head of a dozen good men I&#xD;
would have attacked the pirates with a good rel-&#xD;
ish. I could. hear the groans of those who were&#xD;
wounded, and now that the heat ~f battle had&#xD;
loosened the restraint of subordination, I could&#xD;
hear the yell of the pirates. But the conflict&#xD;
soon ceased, and then I knew that the p~rases&#xD;
were overhauling the ship's cargo.&#xD;
At the end of two hours the ship was allowed&#xD;
to proceedon her way, and shortly afterwards&#xD;
Modiego was assisted down into the cabin by&#xD;
two of his officers. He had received a musket&#xD;
ball in his thigh, but he would notleave the deck&#xD;
until he had seen the ship off.&#xD;
"I shall soon get over is," ~ heard him say,&#xD;
as his bearers settled him rpon a stool. And&#xD;
then noticing me, he added, "Ah, Barclay, wish&#xD;
you'd go on deck and lend a hand at stowing&#xD;
~away some of our poor chaps that have been&#xD;
served with the same sauce I've got. We bad a&#xD;
short fight, but 'twas a hard one. Them Yan-&#xD;
kees did us more damage with their first musket.&#xD;
ry than leould have believed. Buttheysuffered&#xD;
for it. San Pedro I but this thing hurts."&#xD;
I stopped not to hear more, or to niake any&#xD;
answer to what I had heard, but hastened at&#xD;
once on deck, where I fo~ind part of the erew&#xD;
engaged in lowering various boxes ~nd bales in-&#xD;
to the hold, while near the wheel I saw several&#xD;
small iron-bound oaken boxes that I knew to be&#xD;
filled with specie. On forward I found the dead&#xD;

TRE CAPTAIN'S PASSAGE.&#xD;

and wounded, and of course I len~ ~vhet assist-&#xD;
ance I could towards alleviating ufferingsbf&#xD;
the~ penr wretches, a et I did it with a'bad&#xD;
grace, fos'.their men were filled with coarse&#xD;
oaths, and they writhed~1lkq eowards~under th&#xD;
torture. There were five of the~-prateMlUed~&#xD;
and eight of them badly wounded; ~UI4it0s8&#xD;
who escaped unharmed thought themselves -well&#xD;
paid for the loss they had sustained, for theyhad&#xD;
token over seventy thousand dollars in specie,&#xD;
besides a large quantity of valuable merchan-&#xD;
dize.&#xD;
From this time forth I resolved to b$ng the&#xD;
villains to punishment if possible. It was a&#xD;
dubious hope, but yet I cherished It. I was&#xD;
alone against two score of hardened villains,&#xD;
and with no means of succor at hand. And,&#xD;
moreover, 1 knew~ that ifiost of them distrusted&#xD;
me. It i~as at this time that I heard the conver-&#xD;
sation to which I have already alluded-where&#xD;
I learned that I hadbeen allowed to take a pas-&#xD;
- ~sage in the brig withthe probabilitythatlshould&#xD;
not live to finish it.&#xD;
Modiego had had the ball extracted from his&#xD;
thigh, but the wound threatened to be a danger-&#xD;
* ous one, for the leg had swelled, and there was&#xD;
every appearance of mortification. But yet he&#xD;
*lingeftd on for two months without leaving his&#xD;
cabin, and to this may be attributed the fact that&#xD;
the pirates attacked no other vessels. During&#xD;
this time I had devoted every mental energy to&#xD;
the studying up of some plan by which to carry&#xD;
out my wishes, and at length I hit ugon the only&#xD;
thing that seemed to la~ within the range of&#xD;
possibility.&#xD;
We were now in the vicinity of the Capede&#xD;
Verds, and I knew that if anything was to be&#xD;
done it must be aone quickly, for I felt sure that&#xD;
thoplate of putting an end to my life was freely&#xD;
discussed, and favorsblyentertained by the crew.&#xD;
* As length the time for my trial eame, and I had&#xD;
fully resolved to stake my life in the hazard.&#xD;
One day, towards noon, a thick mist began to&#xD;
* arise on the water that came in with a westerly&#xD;
wind; but it did not prevent the officer getting&#xD;
an observation' of the sun, which found us to be&#xD;
in latitude 14 degrees 44 minutes north, and the&#xD;
longitude 18 degrees west. I knew now we were&#xD;
directly opposite. Cape Verde, and notfar from&#xD;
fifty miles distant. By two o'clock theweather&#xD;
was quit. thick, and the wind veered a little to&#xD;
the southward. At tburo'cloek there were some&#xD;
indications of a stormna and the officers wore all&#xD;
&#xD;
on deck. I went down into the cabin and found&#xD;
the captain asleep. In a small chest lashed un-&#xD;
der the table were two spare compasses, one ex-&#xD;
aetly like that in the~binnacle. This compass I&#xD;
took out. It had a copper bowl, and the rim&#xD;
that held the glass top was fastened onbyascrew.&#xD;
I took the rim off and took outthe card. Then&#xD;
I concealed the small box in which the whole&#xD;
hung beneath my bedding, keeping only thecard&#xD;
by me.' I listened a moment to be assured that&#xD;
all was safe, and then I took my pocket-knife&#xD;
and loosened the magnetic needle~om the hot-&#xD;
tom of the card. The course through the night&#xD;
I knew would be nearly due north, so! swung&#xD;
the needle round until the magnetic point was&#xD;
directly under that point of the cardindieatedby&#xD;
N. W. by W. This brought the north point of&#xD;
the card around to N. E: by B., so that were the&#xD;
brig to besteered by that compass as I had fixed&#xD;
it, and her head kept where the compass indicat-&#xD;
ml north, she would in reality be going N. B. by&#xD;
B. I secured the needle to the card again by&#xD;
means of a little wax, and having placed is back&#xD;
in the bowl and screwed the top on again, I hid&#xD;
the whole oace more in my bed.&#xD;
And now the most difficult part of the task&#xD;
was to come. I must exchange compasses with&#xD;
the binnacle; and how wits this to be done when&#xD;
the helmsman's eye was never off from the spotl&#xD;
But my life had been pledged, and I took cour-&#xD;
age; and I should have surely Ihiled had not a&#xD;
lucky idea come. to my assistance. I took the&#xD;
compass from my berth ana put it back into the&#xD;
chest from whence I had first taken it, and then&#xD;
I nervously waited for the moment when I could&#xD;
carry my plan into execution.&#xD;
The night caine on dark ae4 early. 'Not a&#xD;
star was so be seen, and the atmosphere had&#xD;
grown damp and cold. As soon as it was fairly&#xD;
dark I possessed myself of small, single block&#xD;
I found in the stern-boat, and then I moved'cau-&#xD;
tiously about the' deck-anywhere to escape ob-&#xD;
servation. At eight o'clock the watch was&#xD;
changed~ but before the 'off-watch went below&#xD;
the officer concluded to take a reef in' the top-&#xD;
sails, so as so be on the safe side incase of a&#xD;
blow. Pr~videace seemed to be with me, for at&#xD;
that moment the wind began to veer to the&#xD;
westward.&#xD;
"Stand by the braces!" shouted the officer;&#xD;
and as he gave the order I could see the dusky&#xD;
thrins of the 'men U, they moi~ed through the&#xD;
thick darkness.&#xD;
&#xD;
