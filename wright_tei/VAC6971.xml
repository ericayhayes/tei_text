CHAPTER IL&#xD;
THE CHASE.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was October, 177 .. A heavy gale was&#xD;
blowing from the northward. Two vessels-&#xD;
one was a ship, the other a rakish fore-topsail&#xD;
schooner, both armed-were standing off the&#xD;
coast, leaving the Capes of the Delaware. Both&#xD;
were under reefed sails. Tue ship contained&#xD;
Benjamin Franklin, then boundon his mission&#xD;
t Fran ;e -the schooner was the gallant little&#xD;
Wasp to which Barney had been transferred&#xD;
from the Hornet. It was singular that his first&#xD;
experieiee in armed vessels was in these sting-&#xD;
inz 1irds. as Paddy called the bees.&#xD;
The Wasp convoyed Franklin's ship until&#xD;
slei nas well beyond the line of cruisers&#xD;
w hieh infested our coast at that time, and then&#xD;
her Captain, Charley Alexander, put about to&#xD;
return to the Delaware.&#xD;
It was a clear morning when they re-sight-&#xD;
ed Cage lenlopen,and at the same time made&#xD;
out seven 'r sail lay ng in the roads on that side&#xD;
of th-'  i.&#xD;
"Oiita kind of craft do you think they are,&#xD;
Mr lh r ue y * 'isked the captain, as the former,&#xD;
i   'is perched on the foretopsail yard,&#xD;
l-e id at them through a spy glass.&#xD;
-  'ii  inin o'-war, sir. Blast 'em, I owe&#xD;
te h- m  "  irt kirvi of a grudge !" replied&#xD;
- are- tiy heavy vessels ?"&#xD;
-  ar-I 'in sure one of them is a large&#xD;

3509 t   ar "&#xD;
" T    heavy for us--I'll stand off. and then&#xD;
try th+ ('ape May channel," said the captain.&#xD;
The breeze was pretty fresh, and hauling&#xD;
more to the eastward now. But the gallant&#xD;
little Wasp staggered along under a whole&#xD;
topsail, mainsail, foresiil and jib, and soon&#xD;
was up abreast of tie Cape May channel.&#xD;
11cr head was now laid for the entrance of the&#xD;
bay.&#xD;
But she was not to slip in without notice, or&#xD;
an attempt being made to bring her to. Tne&#xD;
British vessels bad evidently, from her rake&#xD;
and rig, discovered her character, and were&#xD;
under a press of canvas standing across to cut&#xD;
her off.&#xD;
'She must bear the topgallant sail," mut-&#xD;
tered the captain, as he saw that his clanc to&#xD;
slip by the enemy's cruisers was slim&#xD;
SShe'll stand it, and the squ-resail, too,&#xD;
sir," said Barney-" the wind is well on our&#xD;
quartr'r&#xD;
The aiditionui sail was added, and with the&#xD;
bows fairly huied in foam, the little schooner&#xD;
&#xD;
stood bravely on her course. The British&#xD;
ships, covered from the deck almost to their&#xD;
trucks with canvas, were coming up. After&#xD;
about two hours run, the leading vessel luffed&#xD;
up, and a cloud oi smoke was seen to puff out&#xD;
from her bow. Then the spray from a shot,&#xD;
as it struck the water nearly a quarter of a&#xD;
mile short of the schooner, rose in the air.&#xD;
"Too weak winded," muttered Barney.&#xD;
Then turning to the captain of the Wasp, he&#xD;
said : "If you please, sir, I think our Long&#xD;
Tom could measure the distance a little better&#xD;
than that."&#xD;
"Try it, Mr Barney, if you like," said the&#xD;
captain.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," replied the youthful offi-&#xD;
cer, "I owe the beef-eating rascals a grudge."&#xD;
Carefully sighting the gun, which threw a&#xD;
thirty-two pound shot, Barney applied the&#xD;
match. Although the leading ship was full&#xD;
two miles off, the effect of Barney's shot was&#xD;
to knock her foreyard in two close to the&#xD;
slings, and to deorive her of the use of both&#xD;
the foresail and foretopsail for a time.&#xD;
"Splendid, Mr. Barney, splendid! 'cried the&#xD;
captain, in delight&#xD;
"Shall I give her another, just by way of&#xD;
compliment, sir:?"&#xD;
"No, sir-not until we get further up the&#xD;
bay. Every shot we fire will deaden our&#xD;
headway-they are too heavy for us, and I&#xD;
see there is a brig larger than us standing out&#xD;
too. If the wind should die away, their boats,&#xD;
with so many men, might give us a deal of&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
Toe three British vessels, new finding itim-&#xD;
possible to cut off the schooner before she&#xD;
would place a middle-ground between them&#xD;
ove: which they could not pass, for they were&#xD;
provided with tory pilots, now stood up the&#xD;
ilInlopen channel, pressing every stitch, of&#xD;
canvas which they could set, determined to&#xD;
overhaul her before she could reach a point of&#xD;
the river protected by the American batteries.&#xD;
But a stern chase is ever a long one. The&#xD;
schooner had a little the advantage in distance,&#xD;
but they had greatly the advantage in canvas,&#xD;
for all three carried studding-sails, and the&#xD;
schooner had none On-on dashed the Wasp,&#xD;
like a deer before the hounds, still keeping&#xD;
just out of gun shot until nearly night. Then,&#xD;
as the breeze began to die away, the enemy&#xD;
began to gain.&#xD;
"It would be accursed luck if we were&#xD;
taken at last," muttered the captain.&#xD;

THE MAN-O'-WAR'S-MAN'S GRUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE  BAFFLED  SUITOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
There was a jolly party, on the second&#xD;
evening after Barney had received his commis-&#xD;
sion, at the sign of the "Spread Eagle," on&#xD;
Market street, Philadelphia Reeves, the bur-&#xD;
ly landlord, assisted by his son Clem, had&#xD;
their hands full to attend to the numerous&#xD;
calls made for Jamaica rum slings and Hol-&#xD;
land schnapps, the two most fashionable bev-&#xD;
erages in those days.&#xD;
In the large, old-fashioned parlor, some fif-&#xD;
teen or twenty perons, mostly officers in our&#xD;
young navy, were gathered, and many a patri-&#xD;
otic toast was given, many a song sung not at&#xD;
all complimentary to King George or his loyal&#xD;
subjects. Young Barney was the hero of&#xD;
the evening, not only in consequence of his&#xD;
recent good conduct, but also because he was&#xD;
"wetting his commission," or, in other words,&#xD;
giving tae entertainment.&#xD;
While these light-hearted and gallant gen-&#xD;
tlemen are enjoying themselves, reader, we&#xD;
will avail ourselves of a mantle of invisibility,&#xD;
and visit another scene which was occurring&#xD;
only a half square or so distant from the tavern.&#xD;
A very lovely young lady was sitting in a&#xD;
handsomely-furntshed room-a parlor, appa-&#xD;
rently. She was rather above the middle&#xD;
height-her figure noble and full, her features&#xD;
classically regular. Her complexion, though&#xD;
clear as the thin rind of a pomegranate, was&#xD;
of a brunettish hue, the rich blood often mant-&#xD;
ling up to her very brow at the slightest ex-&#xD;
citement. Her eyes were large and dark, as&#xD;
if they had been condensed from a night-cloud,&#xD;
with a tiny diamond of blazing light put in&#xD;
the centre of each. These were fringed by&#xD;
long ebon lashes, which hid that light if they&#xD;
were but cast down. At the time which I&#xD;
take for her introduction, she was sitting calm-&#xD;
ly on a chair by a centre.table, one of her&#xD;
hands toying with one of the glossy ringlets&#xD;
which fell upon her white shoulders, the other&#xD;
resting on marble less white than it was. A&#xD;
look of cool contempt was expressed in her&#xD;
face, which well became her haughty, queenly&#xD;
appearance, as she gazed upon the other occu-&#xD;
pant of the room.&#xD;
He was a young man, very richly dressed&#xD;
in the extreme of the then prevailing fashion.&#xD;
But be bore the marks of dissipation, and his&#xD;
face, though it would have been called hand-&#xD;
some by some, had not an expression which&#xD;
would impress a stranger. His figure was&#xD;
elegant, but God had written villain on his&#xD;
brow!t&#xD;
&#xD;
He was striding to and fro in the room,&#xD;
his face red and convulsed with passion, his&#xD;
hands clenched, and his form quivering with&#xD;
rage.&#xD;
At last he paused before the lady, and, in a&#xD;
voice low and husky, said, as he bent his.&#xD;
gleaming eyes upon her:&#xD;
"So, Miss Cora Bedford, you refuse my&#xD;
hand-refuse it with scorn and contempt?"&#xD;
"I do, Mr. Elliott 1" replied the lady, neither&#xD;
blanching before his angry look, nor avoiding&#xD;
the glance of his almost bloodshot eyes.&#xD;
"Am I not wealthy ?" he continued.&#xD;
"The world thinks you are," she replied,&#xD;
with indifference.&#xD;
"Am I not young; as good-looking as any&#xD;
of your admirers?"&#xD;
"You think so!" she responded, in the same&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"Is not my family, am not I, respectable?&#xD;
Stand we not at the topmost round of aristo-&#xD;
cracy?"&#xD;
"No!" responded the beautiful girl-" no!&#xD;
not of the American aristocracy ! Your father&#xD;
is a detestable tory, and you are a contempti-&#xD;
ble puppy !"&#xD;
As she spoke she rose, her queenly form&#xD;
towering, and her face flushing with indig-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
"Were you not a woman !" he muttered,&#xD;
between his grating teeth.&#xD;
"Were I a man, I'd scourge you from my&#xD;
presence, you dastardly coward !" she said.&#xD;
" As it is, Mr. Elliott, all that I can say is,&#xD;
that the atmosphere in this apartment would&#xD;
be much more agreeable to me if it was re-&#xD;
lieved from the pollution of your presence. I&#xD;
hope you will understand that hint, sir, and&#xD;
not oblige me to ring for a servant to expel&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
"By the God who made me, you shall&#xD;
suffer for this, proud girl !" he muttered&#xD;
"Swear by the devil ; God never had any-&#xD;
thing to do with such a wretch as you are!"&#xD;
was her scornful reply.&#xD;
"You shall sue on your bended knees for a&#xD;
favor from me yet!" he cried. "From this&#xD;
hour on, Cora Bedford, I devote myself to&#xD;
your ruin 1"&#xD;
"I defy 'on, you pitiful reptile-and mark&#xD;
me ! the next time you dare to address me,&#xD;
I'll make my father's negro servant scourge&#xD;
you from the door, or horsewhip S ou in the&#xD;
street, if there you speak to me!"&#xD;
"You will?"&#xD;

" I will, Henry Elliott, as sure as I live l"&#xD;
"Then hear my threat, Miss Bedford, since&#xD;
threats are the order of the day-and I will&#xD;
keep mine. I will kiss you the first time I'&#xD;
meet you in public !"&#xD;
" Make your will before you try' it !" re-&#xD;
sponded the spirited girl, opening the door&#xD;
and pointing to it.&#xD;
With a curse upon his lips, the baffled suit-&#xD;
or departed.&#xD;
We wi 1 now return to the jolly party at&#xD;
the "Spread Eagle," then the most fashion.&#xD;
able hotel in town. It was getting late, and&#xD;
their imbihations had made them pretty warm,&#xD;
Barney had just finished a rousing sea song,&#xD;
when an addition was made to the numbers in&#xD;
the room by the entrance of several young&#xD;
men in citizen's dress, but fashionably appa.&#xD;
reled. They took a table near where the offi-&#xD;
eers were seated in a circle, and, although they&#xD;
seemed by their actions to have already taken&#xD;
aboard a pretty heavy cargo, called for a bowl&#xD;
of punch.   .&#xD;
The officers evidently considered this as&#xD;
rather an intrusion, but, as they were in the&#xD;
public parlor, and not in private room, made&#xD;
no remark&#xD;
The punch was brought by the attentive&#xD;
landlord, and the gasses of the new-eomurs&#xD;
were filled.&#xD;
"Here's that you may win your bet, El-&#xD;
liott." said one of the party, draining off :."&#xD;
bumper.&#xD;
"What was the bet. Tom ?" asked another ;&#xD;
"it was made before I came in."&#xD;
"Why," responded the other. "Elliott there&#xD;
made a wager with Sam Wilkins that he d&#xD;
kiss Miss Cora Berlford in the public street be-&#xD;
fore a week has passed'&#xD;
"Whatt the lovely daughter of Alderman&#xD;
Bedford-the belle of the city?'&#xD;
"Yes-an1 I'll bet a guinea that he wins&#xD;
it !" replied the other.&#xD;
Another voice-not from the party-joined&#xD;
in the conversation. It was that of young&#xD;
Barney, whose eyes flashed like sparks of fire&#xD;
as he heard the young fops speak thus lightly&#xD;
of an insult to he premeditatedly offered to a&#xD;
respectable lady.&#xD;
"The man who would make such a bet is a&#xD;
scoundrel, and the fellow who would take it is&#xD;
a fool !" he cried. "The first ought to win a&#xD;
broken head, and the second to be ducked in&#xD;
a horse-pond !"&#xD;
"Do you mean me, sir ?" shouted Elliott,&#xD;
the same whom we recently saw dismissed by&#xD;
the lady. "I made the bet!"&#xD;
&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then I mean you !" replied Barney, coolly.&#xD;
"You are a scoundrel, sir-I will have sat&#xD;
isfaction-you wear a sword !" shouted El-&#xD;
liott, rising from his seat.&#xD;
"Yes, but I only use my sword on enemies&#xD;
worthy of my steel-on the foes of my coun-&#xD;
try. In regard to the term you applied to me&#xD;
I have but one response-what do you think of&#xD;
my bootmaker ?"&#xD;
As he said this, Barney most unexpectedly&#xD;
applied the square toe of a heavy sea-boot to&#xD;
that portion of Elliott's person which had last&#xD;
been in contact with the chair. The latter,&#xD;
backed by his friends, made a blow at Barney,&#xD;
which the latter parried, and then with a tre-&#xD;
mendous right-hander he visited Mr. Elliott's&#xD;
frontispiece on the equinoctial line between&#xD;
his eyes, causing him to take a celestial ob-&#xD;
servation from a reclining posture. The fight&#xD;
now became general. fcr all hands had plenty&#xD;
of combative fluid aboard, and the ears of the&#xD;
staid Quakers of the vicinity were shocked by&#xD;
the shouts, yells and curses of the parties.&#xD;
The noise awoke several watchmen from their&#xD;
slumbers, who rushed to the scene, and after&#xD;
the parties had got through the fight-te&#xD;
citizens having knocked under to, or rather&#xD;
been knocked under by, the officers--made a&#xD;
general arrest of all those who were well&#xD;
whipped, taking the words of honor c f the&#xD;
others that they would appear at ten o'clock&#xD;
the next morning before his worship the Alder-&#xD;
man of the district.&#xD;
Elliott and the most of his companions were&#xD;
ingloriously lugged off to the watch-house,&#xD;
havi' g had very little self inotive left in them,&#xD;
though they were "fast boys."&#xD;
Barney called for the bill, to which, at his&#xD;
request, the landlord added the damages of&#xD;
both parties, and promptly settled it,&#xD;
"What made you pitch into that fellow  o&#xD;
quick, Josh?" asked one of his compaonlud,&#xD;
as the party were departing for their rooms.&#xD;
"I felt a grudge against him the moment t&#xD;
saw his face, that I couldn't exactly account&#xD;
for; but when I heard him speak ofinsulting&#xD;
a respectable woman, then I remembered that&#xD;
I had a mother and a sister, and I boarded&#xD;
him! I couldn't help it-I only wish he was&#xD;
an Eoglishman !"&#xD;
"He's worse--his father is a blasted old&#xD;
tory   I only wonder that he is permitted to&#xD;
live in the city," responded the other. "But&#xD;
good night, Josh-I'il see you at the Alder-&#xD;
man's ' in the mornit g. You'll be all right&#xD;
there-it was his daughter that the puppy bet&#xD;
he would kiss."&#xD;

TUE MAN 0 W ARS-MAN'S GRUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CH APTER V.&#xD;
AN ALDERMAN OF THE OLDEN TIME.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is almost impossible to find a fair repre-&#xD;
sentative of 'an Alderman all of the olden&#xD;
iume" now-a-days   One whose head is filled&#xD;
with wise saws, grave morals, much law, and&#xD;
t et not incapable at times of uttering an offi-&#xD;
ei.l jest, or stiking a culprit into a sense of&#xD;
iter nothingness by his frown. One with&#xD;
t'e as radian'r as the sun seen through morn's&#xD;
sil' ery mist-" round belly with fat capon&#xD;
mel - and eyes capable of looking over the&#xD;
,flicial spectacles rather than through them-&#xD;
'yes capable of telling at a glance an honest&#xD;
tm in from a rogue. Such a man, for instance,&#xD;
my octogenarian friend Binna, the patriarch&#xD;
tat her of the aldermanie tribe in this section.&#xD;
On one occasion, when he demanded bail for&#xD;
the' appearance of a man at court, an indi-&#xD;
'imlual aepped forward and volunteered to be-&#xD;
come surety for the accused.&#xD;
I can t take you, sir," said the Alderman,&#xD;
the mo =ment he looked at him.&#xD;
" \Vh% "''asked the would-be surety, indig.&#xD;
-      I in Fma freeholder."&#xD;
- t don't care.' said the Alderman-"you'd&#xD;

wa. arrested in the very azt of larceny, and&#xD;

the AIderman. as he made out a corumitment&#xD;
for him     ut I'i yawing wildly off the&#xD;
course of my story  pardon me, reader, and&#xD;
l'll haul my tacts aboard and come by the&#xD;
wind again.&#xD;
On the next morning after the battle des-&#xD;
cribed in the last chapter as occurring at the&#xD;
-- Spread Eagle," a visitor to the office of his&#xD;
worship. Alderman Bedford, would have seen&#xD;
that gentleman, attended by his clerk, who&#xD;
was none other than his lovely daughter, enter&#xD;
the room from an inner apartment of his&#xD;
house, for his office was in his dwelling, with&#xD;
a satisfied air of importance on his counten-&#xD;
ance and a huge volume of statutes under his&#xD;
arm The hour was exactly fifty-five min-&#xD;
utes after nins, by the huge old-fashioned gold&#xD;
watch which, with a pound, more or less, of&#xD;
seals attached, rested in a fob over over his&#xD;
truly aldermanic paunch. I need not describe&#xD;
him-in fact, I did so in the commencement of&#xD;
this chapter.&#xD;
It took him about five minutes to seat him-&#xD;
self in the well.cushioned armchair behind his&#xD;
&#xD;
desk, arrange his spectacles, etc.; then care-&#xD;
fully brushing the shiny summit of his bald&#xD;
head with a silk bandanna, and addressing&#xD;
the beautiful girl who, pen in hand, had seat-&#xD;
ed herself by his side, he was ready for bnsi&#xD;
ness. But not an officer entered the door un-&#xD;
til precisely ten o'clock, his hour for opening&#xD;
court.&#xD;
At the moment when that hour arrived, Mr.&#xD;
Elliott and his companions were ushered in by&#xD;
the guardians of the city's peace, all of them&#xD;
looking much the worse for wear. A look of&#xD;
malicious satisfaction crossed the beautiful&#xD;
face of Cora, as, in the battered and bruised&#xD;
face and tattered and bloody garments of El-&#xD;
liott, she recognized her discarded suitor&#xD;
Maddened and humiliated, he cast his eyes&#xD;
down, biting his lips till the red hlood tric-&#xD;
kled from them. In a few moments, Barney,&#xD;
in his neat uniform.,cleanly appareled, an&#xD;
looking as clear and fresh as a son of temper-&#xD;
ance and half as handsome as an Apollo ap-&#xD;
p~eared, attended by his companions, who, bay-&#xD;
ing had a night's rest and the advantages of&#xD;
lavation, looked as different from Elliott and&#xD;
his woe-begone crew as daylight from dark-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
" Who have we here? What is the charge?&#xD;
have those dirty-looking rIffians been caught&#xD;
in some nefarious action ?" asked the Alder-&#xD;
man. Then turning to his daughter 'and&#xD;
pointing to Elliott whom he did not recog-&#xD;
nise, he said: "Mark that fellow, he has the&#xD;
vwry look of a thief. Cora 1"&#xD;
- Yes, father-be looks as if he'd been rob-&#xD;
bing a hen-roostI" she replied, speaking loud&#xD;
enough for him to hear her.&#xD;
Tue captain of the watch now advanced to'&#xD;
make his charge.&#xD;
"Your honor," said he. ' last night, about&#xD;
the hour of twelve, while these gallant young&#xD;
officers were having a quiet little time all by&#xD;
themselves at the 'Spread Eagle,' these here&#xD;
chaps with the battered mugs-and ugly&#xD;
mugs they have, as your worship might see&#xD;
without even looking through your worship's&#xD;
worshipful spectacles-these here fellows went&#xD;
into their room and called for rum punch, of&#xD;
which they'd had more than a full allowance&#xD;
already. Then one of 'em said something&#xD;
that offended this gallant young officer, who&#xD;
had just got his commission for fighting so&#xD;
well the other day down the river, and taking&#xD;
a brig from the d-d Britishers--.-"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Stop the-e!" said the Alderman to tne e ep-&#xD;
tain, in a tone of offended dignity  - You&#xD;
said d--d Britisbe'es, Mr. Crabstick. I hate&#xD;
the British as bad as you do, sir-hut, mark&#xD;
me, they mustn't be d'-d in this court. Anoth-&#xD;
er oath, sir, and I fine you! Now go on with&#xD;
your c rarge !"&#xD;
you ebeg pardon, your honor," said the&#xD;
abashed official. "As I was saying. that 'ere&#xD;
bang-dog looking fellow (pointing to Elliott.)&#xD;
wrathy, and so he up fist and darkened his&#xD;
peepers.  Then a general srlmmage com-&#xD;
meeced, and we went in and ' pulled' the&#xD;
worst of these fellows, and here they are.&#xD;
The officers acted so like gentlemen that we&#xD;
took their words of honor for their appear-&#xD;
anc , and they ar' here to a man."&#xD;
Woat did you strike that fellow for, sir ?"&#xD;
asled the Alderman, addressing Barney.&#xD;
1    astruc  him hecause he struck at me, sir&#xD;
---hut had just kicked him. I commenced&#xD;
the affray, and if your honor would let him&#xD;
off I an willing to pay the fine.  I ve dark-&#xD;
.ned lie top-lights and stove in Ike ivory&#xD;
fe cwork about his head-rail, and he's been&#xD;
pretty badly punished I''&#xD;
I'm to be the judge of that. sir!' said the&#xD;
ma'iat.rate, with a tone of dignity "Why&#xD;
didvou kick him, sir?"&#xD;
B-cause he spoke disrespectfully of a vir-&#xD;
t'mou' hdy, sir-an! in my presence made, a&#xD;
wrager that within a week he would kiss her&#xD;
inibh-street; cad, sir, though I did not know&#xD;
it then, and never had seen her-it' I had. I&#xD;
you'd have knocked his head clear off his&#xD;
shoulders-I am much mistaken if it was not&#xD;
the lovely lady who sits by your side.  The&#xD;
name which he bandied a'out amOng his dis-&#xD;
'      solute and drunken companions was that of&#xD;
Miss Cora Bedford !"&#xD;
"D-n him! did he?     I'd have knocked&#xD;
him down myself !" cried the excited Alder-&#xD;
man. "Kiss my daughter in the street-my&#xD;
Cora-the d-d villain '&#xD;
"Father, father, you are.swearing !" said&#xD;
the fair girl by his side, smi'ing, though her&#xD;
face was suffused with blushes, for Barney's&#xD;
eyes were fixed admiringly upon her.&#xD;
"True, my child-true-the court is in&#xD;
&#xD;
err'r. Tie court fines itself ! How many&#xD;
times din I d-n him?'&#xD;
"T"Twice, father," replied the fair clerk&#xD;
"That's four shillings-d-n him again!&#xD;
Now make it six, and charge it uainat me on&#xD;
the docket!"&#xD;
This act of justice disposed of, the Alder-&#xD;
man turned to Elliott and addressed him :&#xD;
"What is yonr name, where do you be-&#xD;
long, and how do you make your living?&#xD;
Speak up, you vagabond !"&#xD;
My name is Henry Elliott, and you know&#xD;
very well that I'm a gentleman, Mr. Alder-&#xD;
man BedfordeI" said the fellow, looking as&#xD;
fierce as he could through his half-closed&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
eysnry Elliott-what, a son of old Elliot,&#xD;
of Mulberry street ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir-and a visitor at your house!"&#xD;
"Until I ordered him out of it for ,isult-&#xD;
ing. re!" added Covet&#xD;
i You are a pretty looking gentleman-you&#xD;
and your companions there. If I meted out&#xD;
fult justice to you, I would commit you to&#xD;
prison, and cause you to travel'a few days on&#xD;
the treadmill. It is a pity that whipping and&#xD;
ducking are abolished! Ae it is, I fine you,&#xD;
Mr. Gentleman Elliott, five pounds and costs,&#xD;
and each of your companions one pound and&#xD;
costs ! You can pay it now, or stand com-&#xD;
mitted until you do !"&#xD;
Tne mortified villain paid his fine and hur-&#xD;
ried away, amid the sneers of those who were&#xD;
present.&#xD;
"pave 'we any fiues to pay, air?" asketi&#xD;
Barney.&#xD;
"No fines, but you are not to get off with-&#xD;
out punishment, lieutenant! The court sen-&#xD;
tences you to dins with it at three o'clock to-&#xD;
day. Cora, you need not eater the sentence,&#xD;
but don't forget it!"&#xD;
"I'm sure I shall not, sir " ,said Barney,&#xD;
again glancing at the beautiful girl. As their&#xD;
eyes met, both blushed. What could be the&#xD;
cause of that?&#xD;
There being no other business before the&#xD;
court, it adjourned, and the Alderman, at the&#xD;
urgent request of Barney, visited the Sachem,&#xD;
the new vessel which was being fitted out for&#xD;
him.&#xD;

&#xD;
A large, pompous-looking, red-faced gern-&#xD;

from its pictures and welIfided book shelves.&#xD;
seemed to be his library. He held an ooen&#xD;
letter in his hand, which he had jest been&#xD;

A servant entered and asked :&#xD;
"])id you ring for me, sir?"&#xD;
"Yes, Francis ; where is my son? I wisht&#xD;

who was no other than Mr. Henry Elliott,&#xD;
who that moment entered the room, and heard&#xD;
the latter part of his father's remarks.&#xD;
Heavens, Henry ! is it possible that that&#xD;
is you, my eon?"&#xD;
It don't feel much like me, but I believe it&#xD;
is all that is left of me, sir!"&#xD;
"How in Heaven's name did you get beaten&#xD;
so? who did it? and what for?"&#xD;
"It was done by a young officer, who got&#xD;
offended about something that I said aboutold&#xD;
Bedford's daughter. She did me the honor to&#xD;
refuse ag  offer of marriage, yesterday, and it&#xD;
made me mad."&#xD;
"Refused you 7  She, the daughter of a fat&#xD;
Alderman, who hardly kno*s who his grand-&#xD;
fkther was?  She refused the son of Plantag-&#xD;
enet Elliott, who can trace his pedigree back&#xD;
to the Norman conquest, and has an income&#xD;
of ten thousand pounds a year? Impossible ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nor im possible--but actually true '" said&#xD;
the son&#xD;
"I'm glad of it. Tne balance would have&#xD;
been far her-eath you. And no he fied you!&#xD;
I sup"' se he imprisoned the brute who beat&#xD;
yon so "&#xD;
'N', cir--he invited him to dinner I"&#xD;
'B y ihe blood of the Plantagenets, this is&#xD;
i rue'w  u rale ! I'll go and curse him to his&#xD;
face&#xD;
' Do--he'll fine you for very oath you&#xD;
utier&#xD;
"then I won't. He shall not have that&#xD;
mech satisfaction out of me. But I'll be re&#xD;
venged upon him and every cursed rebel that&#xD;
I can. 1 have a letter here from Lord Howe,&#xD;
my son ; he offers me protection to myself and&#xD;
property, and a commission for you, if I will&#xD;
go to New York. I have been thinking of it&#xD;
for some time, and have converted the greater&#xD;
part of my property into ready money."&#xD;
"1'il accept the commission," muttered the&#xD;
young man, "on condition that I'm not at-&#xD;
tached to any permanent corps, which will&#xD;
keep me away from one object. I am bound&#xD;
to have revenge, both on the officer who beat&#xD;
me, and on old Bedford and his daughter,&#xD;
I've sworn to humble her pride, and I will.&#xD;
She scorned to be my bride, but she yet shall&#xD;
be my mistress ! And the sooner we leave&#xD;
here, the better. I will not go into the street&#xD;
to be sneered at after this disgrace!"&#xD;
"It will take some time to remove those&#xD;
marks so as to enable you to be fit to appear."&#xD;
remarked the father. "Francis, go and tell&#xD;
Dr. Minturn to come hereinstantly. You had&#xD;
better retire to your room, Henry. I will re-&#xD;
ply to Lord Howe--his messenger awaits, and&#xD;
I have other news to send him. These ac-&#xD;
cursed rebels will soon be crushed, and we&#xD;
will be amply rewarded for our loyalty. I&#xD;
wouldn't be surprised if I were knigh-ed-I&#xD;
ought to be, for the blood of the Plantagenets&#xD;
runs in my veins !"&#xD;
This statement of the old tory was true---&#xD;
the blood was illegitimate, in consequence of a&#xD;
lack of virtue on the part of one of his female&#xD;
ancestors.&#xD;
Henry now retired to rest, and received chi-&#xD;
surgic care, while his father attended to his&#xD;
treasonable correspondence.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE BOQUET.&#xD;
&#xD;
"When will you have your craft ready for&#xD;
sea, sir?" asked Commodore Hopkins, when&#xD;
he approached Barney.&#xD;
"Within four days, sir-possibly in three."&#xD;
"You have been in a hurry, air."&#xD;
"I have, commodore  I owe the English a&#xD;
grudge, and I want to be hammering away at&#xD;
them again."&#xD;
"Well, sir, you'll soon have a chance. They&#xD;
are ranging all along our coast. I hope your&#xD;
good fortune will continue, and that you will&#xD;
soon bring in' some more prizes."&#xD;
"Thank you. commodore. If Capt. Alex.&#xD;
ander has no objection, I would ask afavor !"&#xD;
"I would refuse you nothing, my dear fel-&#xD;
low," said the last named officer.&#xD;
"One of your quarter gunners, Jim Thomp-&#xD;
son, wants to be transferred to my command.&#xD;
I owe the follow a grudge, for be killed the&#xD;
captain of the brig, you remember."&#xD;
" Yes, and saved your life. That's a strange&#xD;
thine to hold a grudge against.a man for."&#xD;
S'' Well, it was a matter of precedence-the&#xD;
officer was my game. But can I have the&#xD;
man, sir ?'             '      .'&#xD;
"Certainly ; he is a good seaman, and I'll&#xD;
spare him to you. And now, comrmodore, if&#xD;
you and the officers will have the kindness to&#xD;
step into the little cabin of the Sachem, I will..&#xD;
produce an excellent fogmatie in the shape of&#xD;
some fine old Jamaica. It must he good, for&#xD;
it was imported expressly for our use in the&#xD;
brig whichthe Wasp captured the other day I"&#xD;
The officers of course would not injure the&#xD;
reputation of the service by refusing an invi--&#xD;
tation of that kind, and soon were in Barney's&#xD;
snug little cabin.&#xD;
"Ah, Mr. Barney, here's a signal that you've&#xD;
been within hail of some other craft than the&#xD;
British brig-brought her to, maybe, for Isee&#xD;
you've captured the colors!" cried the com-&#xD;
modo're p iming t' a bouquet, which, for want&#xD;
of a flower vase, was stuck in the neck of a&#xD;
porter bottle&#xD;
"The colors are red, white and blue. com-&#xD;
modore, and shallnever be struck to or by me,&#xD;
while I live. That nosegay was sent to me&#xD;
from shore by some one, I know not whom--&#xD;
but a patriot I suppose, from the choice of&#xD;
colors."&#xD;
' And one that wants a place in your mem-&#xD;
ory," said Alexander, pointing to the forget-&#xD;
me'nots.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Some favored fair. Be careful, lieutenant,&#xD;
that some of the handsome Quaker girls don't&#xD;
win you over on the peace question. By-the-&#xD;
way, some one mentioned to me that some of&#xD;
you young officers thrashed some of the citi-&#xD;
zens night before last; how was it ?"&#xD;
',I only punished a puppy for insulting me&#xD;
and threatening to insult a lady, sir.- It wasa&#xD;
trifling affair, not worth mentioning," said&#xD;
Barney.&#xD;
"Perhaps so-but you must be cautious&#xD;
about offending the citizens or getting into&#xD;
difficulty with them. Our navy is in its in-&#xD;
fancy-if people become prejudiced against&#xD;
the child, it will be fed badly, and will grow&#xD;
slowly."&#xD;
"True, sir-butI was provoked into this&#xD;
quarrel. The parties who forced the trouble&#xD;
on were very heavily fined."&#xD;
" And were you not punished ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir-I was forced to eat an excellent&#xD;
dinner with the magistrate, who keeps the&#xD;
best wine in the city I"&#xD;
"I shouldn't mind receiving such punish-&#xD;
ment occasionally myself," said Alexander.&#xD;
"I think, as St. Paul said to Timothy, I could&#xD;
'take it for my stomach's sake."&#xD;
"And 'thine often infirmities,' added Bar-&#xD;
ney, with a laugh. "But, gentlemen, this&#xD;
isn't the rum. There it is, 'in the original&#xD;
package,' as other importers say; here is some&#xD;
sugar which came from the same market, and&#xD;
those lemons were also consigned to us by his&#xD;
Britannic majesty's brig Tender. Help yout-&#xD;
selves."&#xD;
Soon the anti-fogmatic, prepared according&#xD;
to a recipe .of the celebrated Phineas Car-&#xD;
buncle, was mixed, and success to the Sachem&#xD;
and her brave young commander was drank.&#xD;
Alexander, who only wanted a good excuse to&#xD;
repeat the dose, proposed the health of the fair&#xD;
iucognito who had sent Barney the bouquet.&#xD;
This brought a blush to our hero's cheek, and a&#xD;
second.glass to his lips; then he excused him-&#xD;
self and hastened to his duty.&#xD;
"That young man will be an honor to -the&#xD;
service I" said the commodore. "He has got&#xD;
just enough of the devil in him to get him into&#xD;
scrapes, and is cool enough to work his way,&#xD;
out of them. I only hope he won't make a fool&#xD;
of himself by falling in love? A fellow in love&#xD;
ia't worth much aboard ship i"&#xD;
"Permit me to disagree with you, commo-&#xD;

dore !' said Captain Alexander.  "I don't&#xD;
care how much a fellow is in love, provided&#xD;
he don't get married, and knock the romance&#xD;
of the thing overboard. While he is in love,&#xD;
he is ever ambitious to distinguish himself,&#xD;
and win the admiration of her whose affections&#xD;
he would secure. He is anxious to outdo all&#xD;
others, often almost rash and desperate ; but I&#xD;
agree with you that after he is married, he is&#xD;
&#xD;
careful of his life, apt to be homesick, and&#xD;
rather a shaky stick I"&#xD;
"You may be right, sir," replied the old&#xD;
commodore, "but all that I want my officers&#xD;
to do now is to love their flag and do their&#xD;
duty. But we will pay a visit to the Wasp&#xD;
now, and see how she looks."&#xD;
The officers departed, not, however, without&#xD;
again complimenting Barney on his skill and&#xD;
promptness in getting his craft ready for sea.&#xD;

"What did he say, Eliza?"&#xD;
"Why, he said, ma'am, that posies was well&#xD;
in their way, for them that liked them, but he&#xD;
liked the smell of fresh tar better !"&#xD;
"Was that all?"&#xD;
"Not exactly, ma'am. He said my cheeks&#xD;

"Well, what answer did you make-did&#xD;
you tell him to take a bite I"&#xD;
"No, ma'am-for just then the lieutenant&#xD;
came on to the wharf and made a bow as po-&#xD;
lite as if I was a lady. I curtsied clear to the&#xD;
ground. 'Are those flowers for me, my pret-&#xD;
ty maid?' he asked. 'Yes, sir, they be,' I&#xD;
said. 'Then you are the fairy messenger that&#xD;
brought me a bouquet yesterday,' he said. 'I&#xD;
be,' I said. 'There is a guinea for you, my&#xD;
pretty maid,' he said-' and now you'll tellme&#xD;
who sent them, will you not?' 'I can't,' said&#xD;
I-' my mistress told me not to!' 'I saw you&#xD;
at Alderman Bedford's a couple of days ago&#xD;
didn't I?' he asked. 'In course you did, sir!'&#xD;
said I."&#xD;
"Then you let the cat out of the bag, you&#xD;
stupid girl !" cried Cora, half in anger.&#xD;
" Lawks, no, ma'am, I didn't-I hadn't no&#xD;
cat. nor any bag either-though I did think,&#xD;
before I started, of taking the old gray cat's&#xD;
litter of kittens down and drowning them,&#xD;
they're a mewling around in the way, and&#xD;
aren't of any use !"&#xD;
"Did the lieutenant say no more ?"&#xD;

Another morning had arrived. The sun,&#xD;
audacious dog, had just peeped in through the&#xD;
delicate curtain of the eastern window of Miss&#xD;
Cora Bedford's chamber, and had actually&#xD;
caught her in a lovely undress, making a morn-&#xD;
ing toilet ; but not having a tongue, though&#xD;
eyes he surely hath, he could not reveal the&#xD;
secret mysteries by which the sex make them-&#xD;
selves so angelic in appearance in the morn-&#xD;
ing. A man generally gets up drowsy-eyed&#xD;
and yawning, comes forth with frowsy hair,&#xD;
not always with "unwrinkled front," espe-&#xD;
cially in the linen line-looking for all the&#xD;
world like a Dutch doll washedin dirty water&#xD;
and badly ironed out.&#xD;
Miss Cora had not quite finished her toilet,&#xD;
when, with the freedom of a petted servant,&#xD;
Eliza, her handmaiden, entered.&#xD;
"I've seen him  again, Miss Cora !" she&#xD;
cried. "I thought i'd promenade a little in&#xD;
the. staluberous air before you got up, so I&#xD;
picked a bunch of flowers and went down to&#xD;
the side of the river, and there I met him a&#xD;
singin' such a nice song-it was so grand, all&#xD;
about Sandy the oysterman I'&#xD;
"Who, the lieutenant. Eliza?"&#xD;
"No, ma'am--Jim Thompson-him that&#xD;
stuck the British ossifer in the gizzard and&#xD;
paved the leftenant's life."&#xD;
" Ah ! your new substitute for the poor late&#xD;
lamented Corporal Drill!"&#xD;
"There you are again about that lobster-&#xD;
back, Miss Corn! I do wish him and his&#xD;
memory was sunk in the depths of Elysium,&#xD;

"Teir bark was pretty sharp !" said the&#xD;
Alderman.&#xD;
"Their bite will be found sharper and&#xD;
harsher than their bark," said the Lieutenant.,&#xD;
"as I hope to sail in the morning at sunrise!"&#xD;
"So soon ." asked Cora. turning pale.&#xD;
"Yes, fair lady. I merely came on shore to&#xD;
bid yopreelf and father farewell, and to thank&#xD;
you for your kindness to me. Also, 10 say&#xD;
that if ever the arm of Joshua Barney can&#xD;
render you any aid, it and his life are devotedly&#xD;
at your service.  Times are perilous - the&#xD;
chances of war are precarious. Although I&#xD;
have sot the slightest doubt that the ultimate&#xD;
result of this war will be our independence,&#xD;
and it recognized by England and all the&#xD;
world; et long and bloody may be the strug-&#xD;
gle. We are weak in numbers, in munitions,&#xD;
in money, in friends; strong only in the justice&#xD;
of our cause. New York is already in the&#xD;
hands of the enemy. With a powerful army&#xD;
on shore, and an immense fleet afloat, they&#xD;
will probably turn their eyes to this city, and,&#xD;
though we can make them pay dearly for their&#xD;
conquest, they probably may take it. If so,&#xD;
you must fly to the interior-they never will&#xD;
dare to force our countrymen to battle in the&#xD;
forest and amid the defiles of the mountains.&#xD;
If they do, we will slay them as the hurter&#xD;
does the deer, by thousands. My duty will be&#xD;
upon the ocean, the bay and the river. If I&#xD;
&#xD;
live and ever can serve you, depend upon&#xD;
me!'&#xD;
"We will, Mr. Barney," said Cora. "but&#xD;
you paint a gloomy picture. Let us hope for&#xD;
the best, and most especially will my father&#xD;
and myself pray for your safety"&#xD;
"Yes, it is a gloomy picture," added the&#xD;
worthy Alderman. "Bring up a bottle of&#xD;
port, Cora, darling, and let us see if e cannot&#xD;
rigaten the colors a little l"&#xD;
It was a sadly pleasant evening which Bar-&#xD;
ney passed, and, at an early hour for him, he&#xD;
arose to retire. Tears were glistening like&#xD;
diamonds in the beautiful eyes of Cora as she&#xD;
bade him farewell. Nor did she withdraw the&#xD;
trembling hand which he pressed to his lips.&#xD;
"Good bye--God bless you, lieutenant! I&#xD;
wish you good luck and plenty of prize money,&#xD;
without a scar to mar your good looks !'' said&#xD;
the Alderman, as he warmly shook his hand.&#xD;
"have your boat ashore at daylight. I want&#xD;
to send you a few dozen of wine, to keep us&#xD;
in memory while you are gone! '      p&#xD;
I do not need the wine to cause remem-&#xD;
brance, my dear sir! '' said Barney, glancing&#xD;
at Cora-" but the boat shall be sent'g&#xD;
Another lingering look-once more the sad&#xD;
farewell repeated, and then the young officer&#xD;
hastened to his vessel.&#xD;
o' one thing he felt certain--if Cora did&#xD;
not exactly love him, she felt an interest in&#xD;
him, a very friendly interest, and took no pains&#xD;
to conceal it. Another thing he knew.  ie&#xD;
loved her!&#xD;

&#xD;
General Howe sat in his private apartment&#xD;
at his quarters in the city of New York. The&#xD;
table before him was covered with papers and&#xD;
maps. A look of care and aoxrety pervaded&#xD;
his countenance. lie had just dismissed a&#xD;
council of officers, and was determining upon&#xD;
a plan to force Washington, with his ill-fed,&#xD;
unpaid, half-elothed and discontended army,&#xD;
into a a general action, by which at a blow&#xD;
he could crush him. He was, in fact, plan-&#xD;
ning the movements which, by the activity,&#xD;
restless daring and consuniinste skill of the&#xD;
American chief, were foiled no  te plaius of&#xD;
New' Jersey--which were displayed in his&#xD;
movements as lie retreated towedr' Morris-&#xD;
town, &amp;amp;c.  Although the general hme bien&#xD;
successful in his advent, capturio  Ne w York,&#xD;
and defeating the American army on Long&#xD;
Island, he had done nothing Sirce, and ex-&#xD;
pected to be superseded.&#xD;
an orderly announced Plaatag' net Elliott,&#xD;
Esnjuire, and son.&#xD;
admit the gen lenen at once," he said.&#xD;
Then, as the orderly retired, he added, - The&#xD;
very persons I wish to see. They probably&#xD;
will know all about the range of country on&#xD;
the Delaware, and the strength of the rebels.&#xD;
it is singular, that 'wi ran army of veterans&#xD;
we have so much trouble in subduing a dis-&#xD;
organized mass of raw militia. Their Com-&#xD;
mander-in-chief, too, was not bred a soldier,&#xD;
while I have been reared to toe study and&#xD;
practice of military rnanouvres.-'&#xD;
Elliott and his son, the later much im-&#xD;
proved in his appearance since we last saw&#xD;
him "in court," was now ushered in-&#xD;
I am glad to ses you, my loyal friend,"&#xD;
said the general, as he arose and warmly wel-&#xD;
comed the base tory. " This is your son, eh?&#xD;
A fine looking young man--has he concluded&#xD;
to accept a cormmisiou in his Majesty's ser-&#xD;
vice % '&#xD;

he is as loyal as myself."&#xD;
" Then I am sure of his loyalty, my good&#xD;
friend. He shadi be commissioned immediate-&#xD;
ly, and I will place him upon my staff"&#xD;
General, you are very kind. We are bound&#xD;
to y ou by a thousand obligations"&#xD;
Do not speak of it, tir. Elliott. Your&#xD;
loyalty and devotion to King George shall be&#xD;
well rewarded. And now, by the way, I wish&#xD;
to ast yourself and son many questions, on&#xD;
points wher in I find it difficult to obtain re-&#xD;

The eyes of the younger Elliott flashed&#xD;
with joy as he heard this.&#xD;
"The city is not very well guarded, is it?"&#xD;
asked the general.&#xD;
"The city is not, general," said the young&#xD;
man-" but the river below has several pas-&#xD;
ses which are strongly fortified. If the city&#xD;
was once captured by land, by a force march-&#xD;
ing from here, or landing frorm the Chesa-&#xD;
peake, and crossing over, then the rebels&#xD;
might desert their works in the river."&#xD;
" True, my young friend-you seem to have&#xD;
some idea of military movements. Would&#xD;
the citizens of Philadelphia  e apt to resist&#xD;
the occupation of the city very strongly ?"&#xD;
"Very many of them, general, are Quakers.&#xD;
aid of course non-combatrants. Were thtu&#xD;
assured of protection to private property. ani&#xD;
no warike interference, they would remain.&#xD;
if your movements v er    secret, and you&#xD;
could seize others whom I could point out as&#xD;
influential men, by holding them as hostages&#xD;
you could control a large portion of others,&#xD;
who will n.t desert their business if they eii&#xD;
help it, and who have not yet taken up arms&#xD;
on the rebel side, although they lean that -&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"You seem to take a right view of things,&#xD;
young man. I deem myself fortunate in se.&#xD;
curing you as a member of my military fami-&#xD;
ly. Of course you are well acquainted with&#xD;
the section of country within the limits of&#xD;
the states of New Jersey, Delaware and Penn-&#xD;
sylvaniar&#xD;
"I am, sir-I have traveled or hunted over&#xD;
every part of those states."&#xD;
"You will be invaluable to me. Your com&#xD;
mission shall be made out at once. I will or-&#xD;
der my own staff tailor to call and measure&#xD;
you for your uniforms. You are under paty&#xD;
from the date of your father's letter acceptin'&#xD;
my propositions."&#xD;
" Thank you, General. You will ever find&#xD;
me loyal."&#xD;
After they had withdra wn from the audi-&#xD;
ence, the younger Elliott no longer concealed&#xD;
from his father the joy which fitted his breast&#xD;
as he heard Howe reveal his intention of taking&#xD;
Philadelphia.&#xD;
"My day of revenge is not far distant" he&#xD;
cried. "I'll make three hearts bleed. They&#xD;
shall rue and remember the day when they&#xD;
humiliated Henry Elliott!"&#xD;
"That's right, my brave boy l" said thd&#xD;
father. "You have the blood of the Plautag-&#xD;
nets in your veins."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I knowed it! Didn't I tell you last night,&#xD;
eap'n, that we'd he lyin' tew beforedai light I"&#xD;
said Yarnall, as Barney came on deck on the&#xD;
morning after the Sachem bad left the Capes&#xD;
of the Delaware.&#xD;
' Is there anything in sight!' asked the&#xD;
young commander.&#xD;
Nothing but clouds and water, both of 'em&#xD;
as rough as a Christian's road tew glory," re-&#xD;
plied the lieutenant.&#xD;
"It is cold and raw this morning," contin-&#xD;
ued the commander.&#xD;
"I was jest a thinhin' it was. I don't think&#xD;
a glass of sperits would hurt a chap's innards&#xD;
dreadful bad this mornin'-dew you, cap'n ?"&#xD;
"No, I think not, Mr. Yarnall; I'll take&#xD;
charge' of the deck while you go below to try&#xD;
the experiment"&#xD;
"Thankee, cap'n ; our decks won't need&#xD;
washing thisnirning ; the salt water has been&#xD;
pitchia' intew 'em like fun for the last three&#xD;
hours."&#xD;
The lieutenant now shook himself like a&#xD;
great Newroundland dog, for his shaggy pea.&#xD;
jacket was covered wit spray,.end then he&#xD;
descended to test the chemical properties of&#xD;
sugar, Jamaica rum, and a slight dilution of&#xD;
water. He bad been gone but a short time,&#xD;
when the man at the mast-head, stationed as a&#xD;
look out, sung cut:&#xD;
" Sail ho I"&#xD;
"Where away ?' asked Barney.&#xD;
"Broad on the weatherbow, sir."&#xD;
"What is she?'&#xD;
"I can't exactly tell, sir, she and we are&#xD;
heaving and pitching so. She is square rigged,&#xD;
though, and lying to on the same tack that we&#xD;
arc,&#xD;
"A sail in sight, eh, sir?" said Yarnall,&#xD;
coming on deck, with his color slightly im-&#xD;
proved. "I cale'lated on seem' one jest about&#xD;
this time o' day. If she drifts more than we.&#xD;
do, she'll come within hail before night. I&#xD;
foresee that"&#xD;
"I wish the water was smoother-in fight-&#xD;
ing and working condition, at least," mutter-&#xD;
ed Barney.&#xD;
"It will heAafter the blow is over-I cale'-&#xD;
late on that sure," said Yarnall, looking very&#xD;
wise.&#xD;
To one unused to the ne aat this time the&#xD;
prospect from the deck of the Sachem would&#xD;
have seemed terrible. But to a lover of the&#xD;
grand and magnificent ; to a sailor with poetry&#xD;
in his heart ; to one who can recognize the&#xD;
&#xD;
power of God in the tempest-in the sky-kiss-&#xD;
ing waves-in the wilderness, as it sways to&#xD;
the unseen hands of the mighty winmd-aswell&#xD;
as in each lovely hue, each tender vein of the&#xD;
frailest flowers which beautify the earth, it&#xD;
was glorious. The dark blue waves, shadowed&#xD;
by the rushing clouds, tipped and crested&#xD;
with foam, like great snow-capped mountains,&#xD;
rolled very high. The vessel at one time&#xD;
seemed to climb their precipitous sides; then&#xD;
again, with rapid plunge, she would dart down&#xD;
into the deep water-vales, seeming as if she&#xD;
was about to dive to the unknown depths of&#xD;
the ocean. The wind sung through the rig-&#xD;
ging, playing, as it were, "on a carp of a&#xD;
thousand strings," and straining ta little can-&#xD;
vas which was exposed to its fury almost to&#xD;
bursting.&#xD;
This was no day for exercise at arms  Toe&#xD;
battery was secured with extra tackles, and&#xD;
carefully housed wilh tarpaulius; the hatches&#xD;
were battened down, preventer braces and&#xD;
stays rove and taughtened-everythiog done,&#xD;
in fact, which consummate seamarsip and&#xD;
prudence dictated  Fortunately the wind was&#xD;
blowing off shore, so that there was no danger&#xD;
under their lee. There is nothing which a&#xD;
thorough sailor dreads more than the prox-&#xD;
imity of land when a gale of wind is blowing&#xD;
or coming on.&#xD;
As the day wore on, many an eye was turned&#xD;
toward the sail which had been diseove&#xD;
first after daylight. She evidently.drfted faster&#xD;
than the Sachem, for by three o'clock in te&#xD;
afternoon she could be seen from the deck of&#xD;
the latter, and her rig-'-that of a brig-distin-&#xD;
guished. But colors were not hoisted by&#xD;
either vessel, for it lIlew rather too hard to&#xD;
show bunting, and entirely too bara for ves-&#xD;
sels to attempt toelose with each other in any&#xD;
thing like hailing distance.&#xD;
When night came on, the vessels were not&#xD;
more than six or seven, miles apart, the brig&#xD;
being on the weather beam, instoud of the&#xD;
weather bow, of the Sachem .&#xD;
"I reckon that's a cussed Englisher," said&#xD;
Yarnsll, as he took a look at her just before&#xD;
dark ; "and I foresee that if she keeps on&#xD;
drifting, she'll be just two miles on our lee&#xD;
quarter in the morning."&#xD;
"Well,,a go9dtook-out must be kept for&#xD;
1 her, especially if it lulls during the night. She&#xD;
might edge down on us before we were ready,"&#xD;
said Barney.&#xD;

and a guernsey shirt-he wore a silk handker-&#xD;
chief wound tight around his head. a his&#xD;
waist belt were stuck a pair of bell-mouthed&#xD;
long brass pistols, which would have carried&#xD;
over an ounce ball, but which, for better effect&#xD;
in a crowd, he had loaded writh buekaot,-a&#xD;
handful to each. A large butcher knife, in a&#xD;
leatnern scabbard, was also stuck in the same&#xD;
belt. He held in his hand a weapon wheh he&#xD;
had christened his "patent amputator, ' a cut.&#xD;
las which had been made to order expressly&#xD;
for him. It was baestet-nilted,straight, double-&#xD;
edged, and weighed at least fifteen or sixteen&#xD;
pounds. In his powerful grasp, it was, indeed,&#xD;
a terrible weapon. With ius blueish, passion-&#xD;
less face-his cool and calculating air and&#xD;
peculiar dress, ne formed a picture worthy&#xD;
even of a more minute description than I am&#xD;
giving.&#xD;
The crew were now all ready, the magazine&#xD;
opened, and every one at bi' post.&#xD;
" It is about time that th'e ball opened, Mr.&#xD;
Yarnall," said Barney.&#xD;
"I was jest a thinking so, cap'n," replied&#xD;
the lieutenant. "Shan't I step below to see&#xD;
what time it is, so tew enter it on the log? I&#xD;
foresee that we'll take that 'ere Johny Bull in&#xD;
one hour and fifteen minutes by the watch."&#xD;
"Time her if you want to," said Barney,&#xD;
laughing, who suspected, and not without rea-&#xD;
son, that Yarnall wanted to pay his respects&#xD;
to his favorite "sperrits " before going- to&#xD;
work.&#xD;
Edging down until within about a mile of&#xD;
the Englishman, who, under her fore course,&#xD;
two topsails, main spencer and jib, was wait.&#xD;
ing for them, Barney hauled up on a wind and&#xD;
hove the Sacheim to.&#xD;
"Now, JimThompson, I want to see what&#xD;
you can do with your long Tom, there i" he&#xD;
cried to his gunner. "Try not tohit the spars&#xD;
of the brig, I want them to stand, so that I&#xD;
can take her into port, but pitch the iron into&#xD;
her hull. Try and dismount some of her&#xD;
guns."&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir," said the brave old seaman,&#xD;
slowing his gup around on its pivot, and ela.&#xD;
* vating it for the range. After it was carefully&#xD;
sighted,-he applied the match, and with a an&#xD;
len and spiterl roar at "spoke out," and sent&#xD;
its whizzig messenger across the water.&#xD;
&#xD;
The day wore on, and after the sun had&#xD;
reached its meridian, the strength of the wind&#xD;
perceptibly began to decrease. The British&#xD;
brig, evidently much heavier in tonnage and&#xD;
metal, as well as more fully armed than the&#xD;
Sacem. showed no disposition to escape or&#xD;
avoil a'combat. As the sea began to go down&#xD;
with the wind, Barney hoped to be able to en-&#xD;
gage her before night ; but when the sun went&#xD;
down the sea was still too high to attempt to&#xD;
do anything with the battery. As soon as it&#xD;
was dare: the British vessel hoisted a light.&#xD;
)erertined not to be outdone in politeness,&#xD;
Barney did the same, giving orders to keep&#xD;
a vigila'it watch upon the movements of the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
It was an anxious night with him. The wind&#xD;
was rapidly sinking, the sea falling in height&#xD;
all the time-a prospect, yes, a certainty, of a&#xD;
desperate struggle with a powerful foe as soon&#xD;
as h nere was light enough to work with advan-&#xD;
tage. He did-not retire at all, but, wrapped in&#xD;
his sea cloak, paced the deck during the entire&#xD;
night, often glancing at the light which rose&#xD;
and fell upon tae heaving waves so near tohim.&#xD;
The cre w had their usual rest, being on watch&#xD;
and watch.&#xD;
At last, the welcome light of day appeared,&#xD;
and Barney saw that the wind and sea had&#xD;
sufficiently fallen to enable him to engage his&#xD;
opponent At sunrise, his colors were hoisted,&#xD;
and replied to by the enemy. But'determined&#xD;
to give his ruen every advantage in his power,&#xD;
ne gave them ample time for breakfast, and.&#xD;
advised by the thoughtful Mr. Yarnall, doubled&#xD;
their ration of "spirits."&#xD;
It was between eight and nine o'clock when&#xD;
he beat to quarters and cleared for action.&#xD;
Tne brig was so close that her drum and fife&#xD;
could be distinctly heard as she followed the&#xD;
example. Her commander had evidently&#xD;
taken matters just about as coolly ss Barney&#xD;
had                                i&#xD;
Sail wag now made upon both vessels, and&#xD;
the Sachem began to edge down upon the&#xD;
brig. She had the advantage only in being to&#xD;
windward, and being thus enabled to choose&#xD;
a distance suitable to work her long eighteen&#xD;
to the best effect.&#xD;

Barney watched the result through his spy-&#xD;
gla's.&#xD;
Depress your gun a trifle; that shot went&#xD;
two feet above hu hammock nettings, and&#xD;
through the foot of his foresail," said Barney.&#xD;
At this moment, a range of smoke and fire&#xD;
belched out from the side of the brig, and the&#xD;
thunder of her whole broadside was heard.&#xD;
But it was poorly directed-the guns were not&#xD;
sufficiently elevated, or fires in range. Only&#xD;
one shot came near the Sachem and thatstruck&#xD;
the water close to her, and ricocheted clear&#xD;
over her hull, making a hole in a sail. The&#xD;
spray from it, however, took Yarnall in the&#xD;
breast and face, as he leaned over the lee bul-&#xD;
warks looking at the brig.&#xD;
"Darn 'em!l" he muttered, "I knowed they'd&#xD;
go to splashing a feller all over with saltwater.&#xD;
if id my bran new uniform on it would have&#xD;
been all the same tew them,!"&#xD;
Thompson had by this time re-loaded his&#xD;
gun, and, having measured his distance, he&#xD;
sent his second shot crashing through the bul-&#xD;
warks of the brig.&#xD;
Well done-you've begun to stir themup!"&#xD;
said Barney. "Keep the game up. Mr. Yar-&#xD;
nall, you may open with the lee battery ; be&#xD;
careful not to throw away a shot.''&#xD;
"No fear, cap'n-1 never was brought up&#xD;
tew waste iron. I'll be as keerful as I can."&#xD;
The action now became general. Although&#xD;
tue carronades were not very effective at the&#xD;
dioin:ce, the long uun of tle Sachem told with&#xD;
terrirle fiect-splinters whitened the side, of&#xD;

i w siehting a gun, then applying a match,&#xD;
now kicking a powder-monkey for not hurry-&#xD;
ing up the ammunition, then helping to move&#xD;
a wounded man out of the way of the guns,&#xD;
making all the while, in his own dry way,&#xD;
quaint remarks, which, even in that exciting&#xD;
and terrible hour, brought peals of laughter&#xD;
rom the men.&#xD;
A shot from the enemy having shattered the&#xD;
head of a poor fellow near him, who had often&#xD;
annoyed him by his stupidity, and covered him&#xD;
with blood and brains, he remarked, as he&#xD;
cooly wiped his face:&#xD;
" Who'd have thought that Bill Jenkins had&#xD;
brains-he hardly knowed enough tew keep&#xD;
himself out of the fire 1"&#xD;
The smoke now became so dense, as it swept&#xD;
down upon the brig, that she could scarcely&#xD;
be seen by the men on board of the Sachem,&#xD;
R ho, however, kept up a fire at the flash and&#xD;
report of her guns.&#xD;
Barney now began to think of bringing the&#xD;
matter to a decision by closing up.&#xD;
Bidding the boarders to prepare for work,&#xD;
under cover of the smoke of a heavy broadside,&#xD;
he squared away, double shotting his larboard&#xD;
battery with grape and canister, intending to&#xD;

Every thing met his plans to a charm. He&#xD;
was close aboard before the commander of the&#xD;
brig saw his intention, and it was toe late for&#xD;
the latter to entirely evade the raking broad-&#xD;
side. however, he put his helm hard up the&#xD;
moment that the Sachem's sails loomed out of&#xD;
the smoke, closeaboard; butthis only brought&#xD;
the sooner in contact as the Sachem luffed up.&#xD;
The instant that their hulls crashedtogether,&#xD;
Barney ano Yarnall, heading their men, leaped&#xD;
on board the brig. They were met by the&#xD;
officers and crew of the brig with a determined&#xD;
front, and a terrible struggle for the mastry&#xD;
ensued.  The clear shout of Barney--the&#xD;
hoarse cry of Yarnall, as he literally mowed a&#xD;
swathe with his huge cutlas--rung high&#xD;
above the cheers of the combatants, the yells&#xD;
of the wounded, and the groans of the dying.&#xD;
The deck was slipperywith blood.' The smoke&#xD;
rose like a frowning storm-cloud above the&#xD;
combatants, for steel was to decide the battle&#xD;
now. Theimpetuosity of Barney's crew drove&#xD;
the English back to their quarter-deck, but&#xD;
here they formed; and with a bristling row of&#xD;
boarding pikes madd a hedge of steel. Yar-&#xD;
nail's right arm at this moment was disabled&#xD;
by a shot. Until now, he had not seemed to&#xD;
think of his huge mouthed pistols. But losing&#xD;
the use of his sword-hand freshened his me-&#xD;
mory, and drawing them in succession with&#xD;
his left hand, he fired them in the faces of the&#xD;
close clustered men. The heavy loads scat-&#xD;
tered death in the ranks. The commander of&#xD;
the brig and two other officers fell.&#xD;
"Darn ye, I thought that 're hail storm&#xD;
would bother ye !" shouted Yarnall, drawing&#xD;
his butcher knife, and plunging into the melee&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Quarter 1" yelled a seaman, into whom&#xD;
he drove the long blade up to the wooden&#xD;
handle.&#xD;
"Why didn't you speak sooner, you tarnal&#xD;
fool?" he cried, as he drew forth the reeliag&#xD;
weapon just in time to parry a pike which was&#xD;
within a few inches of his breast.&#xD;
"Keep your tarnal fish spear to yourself !"&#xD;
he said, as he sprang inside of the reach ofthe&#xD;
man who held it, and, with a kick from his&#xD;
huge foot, hitting the man in the pit of the&#xD;
stomach, made him double up and yell as if.&#xD;
he was mortally wounded.&#xD;
The English, having no officer to encourage&#xD;
them, were now completely disheartene&#xD;
Their cries for quarter reached the ears of&#xD;
Barney, and seeing that their flag was i'a - I&#xD;
down, be at once bade his crew cease t'   r&#xD;
terrible havoc.&#xD;
The moment that it was over, Yarnali wr-et&#xD;
on board the Sachem, and descended into 'he&#xD;
cabin. He returned in a few momenta say-&#xD;

and--ob, Lord? he's come!"&#xD;
" Wno ?" cried Cora, as she saw Eliza, who&#xD;
was looking out of the window, turn pale as&#xD;
death.&#xD;
"Oh, its Corporal Drill!  I wish that Jim&#xD;
Thompson was here, or your lieutenant Lord&#xD;
ha' mercy on me, a sinner! they're a coming&#xD;
right across the street, a whole dozen on 'em,&#xD;
with an ossifer at their head!1"&#xD;
Cora turned pale, too, for she had recog-&#xD;
ntzed that officer, and in him an enemy whom&#xD;
she had last seen under far different circum-&#xD;
stan cets,&#xD;
What his feelings and intentions were might&#xD;
best be inferred from the fact that, without&#xD;
paying the slightest respect to the rules or&#xD;
courtesy, he entered the house without per-&#xD;
mission, or even knocking at the door, and in&#xD;
a moment, followed by twelve armed men, he&#xD;
entered the drawing-room, in which Cora&#xD;
Bedford stood, not pale now, but red with&#xD;
rage.&#xD;
"What means this intrusion?" she asked,&#xD;
and her dark eye flashed like fire as she&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
"You know me, Miss Bedford, do you not?"&#xD;
said the officer.&#xD;
"Yes, Henry Elliott, I know you as a tory&#xD;
and a villain. a traitor and a puppy--know&#xD;
you as the liveried servant of a base tyrant I"&#xD;
You had better be sparing of your abuse,&#xD;
my fair and haughty maiden. You are in my&#xD;
power now&#xD;
"Never, wretch, while I hold my own life&#xD;
in my hands!' sue said, bitterly, her proud&#xD;
form swelling in queenly pride as she spoke&#xD;
"We'll see !" tneered the cificer. "Where&#xD;
is your father? My business for the time is&#xD;
with him. Your case shall meet my earliest&#xD;
attention after I dispose of him!'&#xD;
"What do you mean, vile monster, in re-&#xD;
gard to my rather? Ie is sick-nigh unto&#xD;
death's door! '&#xD;
Not so sick but that he can be removed&#xD;
to prison, 1 expect " said the fiendish brute&#xD;
"To prison ? Oh, God, Henry Elliott, you&#xD;
dare not!"&#xD;
"I dare anything. Cora Bedford ! I am the&#xD;
favorite aid of the British general, and have&#xD;
my own way in regard to matters !"&#xD;
"But my father is helpless--to remove him&#xD;
from his room would be instant death if he&#xD;
must die, kill him in his bed, and stain your&#xD;
coward hand with my blood I"&#xD;
"On, no--I shall reserve you for a pleasant-&#xD;
er fate, Miss Corn; I have not forgo ten my&#xD;
love S et !" said the villain, with a look whien&#xD;
made tbe poor girl shudder wi'h horror.&#xD;
"If your fattier is too ill to be removed at&#xD;
present. it will not prevent my putting a guard&#xD;
over him ; and as 1, am peruitteu to choose&#xD;
my own qiiar ors, I shall become your guest.,&#xD;
though p,-rbaps rather an unwelcome one, for&#xD;
the time&#xD;
&#xD;
"Most unwelcome ; but if you are so base&#xD;
and dastardly as to force yourself under this&#xD;
roof, I can confine myself to my poor father's&#xD;
sick room !"&#xD;
"As' you please ; but remember that you&#xD;
will not be permitted to leave this house with-&#xD;
out my permission !"&#xD;
"I shall not leave my father's side, sir!"&#xD;
said the maiden.&#xD;
"Corporal Drill, you with your party will&#xD;
take up your quarters in this house, and see&#xD;
that none of its inmates depart without my&#xD;
permission."&#xD;
"Yes. sir," said the corporal, giving the&#xD;
soldier's salute as he drew his stiff bode up to&#xD;
its lull height, and brought his musket from a&#xD;
"shoulder 'to a "carry."&#xD;
"My duties at headquarters deprive me of&#xD;
the pleas re of remaining in your company at&#xD;
present, I iss Bedford," said the officer, with&#xD;
monk politeness-" but I will return at an&#xD;
early hour this evening, and hope then to find&#xD;
you in a more amiable humor!"&#xD;
Toe instaut le left the room. Cora hurried&#xD;
to her father Eiza was about to follow, when&#xD;
Drill, who had laid aside his musket, stretched&#xD;
our his arms as if to embrace her, and said;&#xD;
"Eliza. old sweetheart: don't e know me-&#xD;
yours to command, Timothy Drill, first cor-&#xD;
poral in his majesty's sixty-first foot?'&#xD;
"Yes, I de know you, you old lobster-back,&#xD;

"Why, 'Liza, you ain't agoin' to file off and&#xD;

"Yes, I be! I despise you! You're worse&#xD;
than a gorgian monster, so you are !"&#xD;
"Whew! I smell powder t Some one has&#xD;
been foraging around the camp since I was&#xD;
here. You ve found some other lover, eh?"&#xD;
"If I have, he's a better lookin' man than&#xD;
you be, and if he was here now, he d 'nihilate&#xD;
you to atoms, so he would! if you've got to&#xD;
stay in this ere house, you mas keep your&#xD;
tongue to yourself-I won't have nothing to do&#xD;
with you&#xD;
"Well, you'll introduce us to the cook, won't&#xD;
you?   Ws musn't starve in the midst of&#xD;
plenty'"&#xD;
"Yes, I'll introduce you to the cook. She's&#xD;
a Digger, and '11 just suit you. I hope she'll&#xD;
pizen your wittles !"&#xD;
"No danger of that--we'll make her eat a&#xD;
part of all she cooks&#xD;
' Do-she's just fit to set down to tale with&#xD;
a lot of mean grinoramuses like you!' cried&#xD;
Eliza, as she darted past the corporal, and fol-&#xD;
lowed her mistress.&#xD;
"Your old sweetheart, that you've been&#xD;
bragLimg of, is as sour as vinegar!" said one&#xD;
or toe sildiers.&#xD;
"She used to be as sweet as honey !" said&#xD;
Drill, wirhasigh  "Women is like powder: if&#xD;
you doa't lake care of it. it's dead sure to&#xD;
&#xD;
spoil. Then agin, women, in another sense, is&#xD;
like powder: they'll go off with a spark at&#xD;
any time. Then, agin, women is like powder,&#xD;

women is like powder, because they're dan-&#xD;
gerous to handle. Then, agin, women is like&#xD;
powder, for if they git damaged once, they&#xD;
ain't good for much afterwards."&#xD;
After this lengthened opinion, the corporal&#xD;
glanced toward the sideboard, upon which, as&#xD;
was usual in those days, stood several decan-&#xD;
ters of liquor.&#xD;
&#xD;
"As we're quarterod here, it's wrong for us&#xD;
to suffer thirst !" he said.&#xD;
And, to show that he really believed his&#xD;
statement, and spoke conscientiously, he at&#xD;
once filled a large tumbler, and drank it off.&#xD;
"wThat's old Jamaica, and has the real&#xD;
smack I" said he, as he put the glass down.&#xD;
"So has my hand!" 'cried Eliza, as her palm&#xD;
came in contact with his cheek, for she at that&#xD;
instant re-entered the room.&#xD;
"Oh, if you wasn't a woman I" muttered&#xD;
the corporal, as he rubbed his stinging cheek.&#xD;
"If I wasn't a woman, I'd be a man, and I'd&#xD;
kick you out of doors !" she cried, as she went&#xD;
into another apartment.&#xD;

The negro obeyed, and an officer attired&#xD;
in a gay uniform, entered the squalid apart-&#xD;

backed chair in which she sat, but her pale&#xD;
face flsheld as she looked upon him--who&#xD;
was none other than Henry E tiott.&#xD;
"My Godl, Caroline! you here, and in this&#xD;
a station ?" he exclaimed, in a tone of surprise.&#xD;
Why should you be astonished to find me&#xD;
here, and in tVis situation ?" she said, in a bit-&#xD;
ter tone.  ' You, who left me alone and pen-&#xD;
niless--me, the wretched mother of your idiot&#xD;
child-when you knew that for you I was an&#xD;
outcast from friends and home"&#xD;
"But, Caroline, I was forced to leave sud-&#xD;

into her lap. "Get what you require, and&#xD;

"The price of treason!" she muttered, as&#xD;
she regarded the money. "It is fitting that&#xD;

Raising her dark eyes again to Elliott's face,&#xD;
she asked:&#xD;

"I have," he replied, as a gleam of triumph&#xD;
shot athwart his face. "I have taken up my&#xD;

Poor Cora is yet to learn a harsher lesson than&#xD;
I have? Not by your hand, Henry Elliott, if&#xD;
I have to slay you myself !" muttered she. "I&#xD;
will befriend the poor girl : lost and ruined&#xD;
though I am, I may yet save her-save her&#xD;
from the dark intentions of that hell-spawned&#xD;
miscreant!"&#xD;
She paused, and seemed for a time to be lost&#xD;
in thought. The negro entered the room.&#xD;
"Can't ole Cato do nuffin' for you, misse? "&#xD;
he asked.&#xD;
Her eye glanced at the purse in her lap.&#xD;
"Yes, Cato," she replied. "To-night, after&#xD;
it is dark, I shall go from here and get some&#xD;
other clothing, and secure a better lodging.&#xD;
'To-morrow we will leave this wretched hovel."&#xD;
"You're not gwine to send poor ole nigger&#xD;
off'. missee ? "&#xD;
"No, Cato-you have shared my poverty,&#xD;
and worked for me--I will not des;e't you now&#xD;
that I have money. You shall still be my&#xD;
servant."&#xD;
" Tankee, missee. Ole nigger'd drown he-&#xD;
self" if missee send him off I'I&#xD;
"Cato," continued the lady, "to-night I&#xD;
shall wrap that dirty bt'at up in a blanket, and&#xD;
put a card on it, stating who its father is.&#xD;
Thank Heaven, it looks so like him that it will&#xD;
be useless for him to deny the parentage. You&#xD;
must manage to have it left at the quarters of&#xD;
the British General, so that he will be sure to&#xD;
see it !"&#xD;
"Yes missee : 'spose you put him in a bas-&#xD;
ket, den put mass gin'ral's name on basket.&#xD;
and I take it and carry it to him quarters, and&#xD;
say him a basket ob fruit my missee send to&#xD;
him!"&#xD;
"Yes, that will do. Bitter fruit it is, and&#xD;
accursed the trre which bore It! Now, Cato.&#xD;
take some of this money, and buy me food and&#xD;
a bottle of wine. I must have strength to car-&#xD;

how I wish that I was a man 1"&#xD;
"Thou wouldn't wish thyself a woman&#xD;
again, if young Barney was by thy side !" said&#xD;
the old man, trying to smilsi&#xD;
"Be them red-backed lobsters going tostay&#xD;
here, Miss Cora ?" asked Eliza, indignantly, as&#xD;
she came in the room at this tine.&#xD;
"They have the power-we have no way&#xD;
to force them out, Ehza," said Miss Bedford,&#xD;
sadly&#xD;
I'll git 'em out !" said Eliza. "I'll funni-&#xD;
gate them with brimstun, as they do rats in&#xD;
the shi ps !"&#xD;
.I fear wa should suffer from the funniga-&#xD;

smile. 'But can you not keepthem in order?&#xD;
I see your old beau, Corporal Drill, is among&#xD;
them!"&#xD;
"?My old beau! He's just had one remind-&#xD;

my beau ! I'd rather have a bear or a Choc-&#xD;

"Well-get along as easy as you can, Eliza.&#xD;
Do not gin the ill-will of the men if you can&#xD;
help it. We may need the friendship of a dog,&#xD;
yet, for we know not what may happen. Ido&#xD;

"A Hottentot, you mean, I suppose, Eliza I"&#xD;
"Some knd of a hot, or a tot, I don't care&#xD;
what, so long as it's hateful!" said the girl.&#xD;
"There's the parlor bell ringing-I suppose&#xD;
some of the lobster-backs want to be waited&#xD;

She returned in a moment, and said :&#xD;
"It's that hateful story lieutenant, miss.&#xD;
He wants to see you."&#xD;
"Tell him I am ousy-I am with my sick&#xD;
father "&#xD;
"I did, Miss Cora, sad the ordatious wretch&#xD;

"I will go there 1'' said Cora, with her eyes&#xD;
flashing. "I've that which will protect me I"&#xD;
and, as she said so, she showed tue hilt of a&#xD;
dagger which rested in her hosom.&#xD;
"So have I-I've got nails and teeth, and if&#xD;
&#xD;
he offers to consult you, Miss Cora, I'll make&#xD;
him think bedlum's got loose !"&#xD;
"For my sake have a care, child-I am&#xD;
weak, and illy able to defend thee !" said the&#xD;
old man.&#xD;
"Fear not, dear father. I put my trust in&#xD;
God. The wretch dare not go too far ! I am&#xD;
not entirely in his power. God help me if I&#xD;
was !"&#xD;
She shuddered as the thought sped across&#xD;
her mind. Then, accompanied by her maid,&#xD;
she went into the room where Elliott was seat-&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
"Am I wanted for anything special ?" she&#xD;
asked, haughtily, as she stood confronting him.&#xD;
"Yes, Miss bedford--but as our conversa-&#xD;
tion will not be very brief, you had better be&#xD;
seated."&#xD;
" It must he brief on my part, sir, and I prefer&#xD;
standing. My father requires my constant at-&#xD;
tendance.  Say what you have to say, and&#xD;
permit me to retire."&#xD;
"Really, Miss Cora, that look of anger, and&#xD;
your heightened color, becomes your style of&#xD;
beauty remarkably well."&#xD;
"If you only sent for me to insult me, sir, I&#xD;
will leave you"&#xD;
"KNo-no ! Have the kindness to remain a&#xD;
moment. I have some written orders from my&#xD;
general; which I wish to read to you."&#xD;
'They do not interest me, sir-obey them&#xD;
for all I care 1"&#xD;
"Bat they do interest you, haughty lady,&#xD;
and I shall obey them!  Tie first is an order&#xD;
to keep a strict armed surveillance over your&#xD;
father until he recovers sufficiently to be taken&#xD;
to a safer prison. The second assigns quar-&#xD;
ters for myself and guard in this house. You&#xD;
are aware, of course, that in war time we are&#xD;
biletted on the enemy 1"&#xD;
"Well, sir, have you done ?"&#xD;
"So far as the orders are concerned, but&#xD;
now that I am a guest, even though an unwel-&#xD;
come one, I hope my lovely hostess will not&#xD;
deny me the pleasure of a few moment's con-&#xD;
versation occasionally, to remind me of the&#xD;
past, when I was more welcome than I am&#xD;

agreeable she is to to me, the more pleasant it&#xD;
will be for herself and those who dwell under&#xD;

"The less I have to say to you. sir, the bet-&#xD;

"Here, ditto!" said Eliza, following her&#xD;
mistress, who left the room&#xD;
' By Jove, I'll soon tame that pride !" mut-&#xD;

drank toe contents of a glass filled to the brim&#xD;

The general now bade an orderly bring a ing with the basket. He had but just entered&#xD;
basket of fruit from a certain locality, which the street, when his eye fell upon the negro&#xD;
had been left in the care of a sergeant's wife, Cato, who had evidently been on the watch to&#xD;
precisely as it had been left for the general, see toe result of the affair, and who was now&#xD;
the night before.                         hobbling away.&#xD;
In a short time the soldier returned and  "Here, you black seQundrel!" he shouted,&#xD;
placed the basket on a table.             "stop-I want to speak to you i",&#xD;
"Do me the favor to uncover it, lieuten-  Cato first looked as if he intended to run-&#xD;

TEE CRUISE or THEA.HEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
For some time our friend Barney has been&#xD;
lost sight of; but do not deem that he, with&#xD;
his daring heart, ardent spirit, and towering&#xD;
ahirionhas been idle.&#xD;
Four months had gone by since he had&#xD;
passed the Capes of the Delaware, bound sea-&#xD;
ward, and many aprize had been taken by the&#xD;
Sachem. At last, however, the news that&#xD;
Philadelphia had been occupied by the enemy&#xD;
reached his ears, from an outward bound ves&#xD;
el which he had captured.     h&#xD;
"I knowed they d have Philadelphy ?' said&#xD;
Yarnall, when the news was communieated.&#xD;
"By heavens, they won't keep it long !"&#xD;
said Barney, in much agitation, as he paced&#xD;
his deck after hearing it.&#xD;
"Do you mean to try to retake it with the&#xD;
Sachem? 'asked the first luff, in his dry way.&#xD;
"If you do, I forsee some trouble."  -&#xD;
"If I can do nothing by way of ret'akingit,"&#xD;
said Barney, " I can collect a squadron which&#xD;
will help to starve them out. If Washington&#xD;
will only blockade them by land, I'll do it by&#xD;
water. But, Yarnall, I'm going to look: inte&#xD;
the bay ; I'm bound to visit Philadelphia, if it&#xD;
costamy life i"&#xD;
"Or liberty! I knowed you would! Darn&#xD;
the women!" muttered Yarnall.&#xD;
"What do you mean, sir?" asked theyoung&#xD;
commander, sternly.&#xD;
"Why, ap ,there's no use of your fiarin'&#xD;
up about it-I didn't go for to rile you-but&#xD;
ever since them poises or nosegays come&#xD;
aboard at Philadelphy, I knowed you was in&#xD;
love there. I've watched'you many a night a&#xD;
w akin' the deck, and a lookin' at the stars,&#xD;
and a talkin' t yourself or somebody that&#xD;
din't hear you, and I foresaw matrimony&#xD;
looming up atween you and t'other Bend of&#xD;
life. So now you want to put into Delaware&#xD;
Bay and up the river, like as not when it's as&#xD;
thick covered with British ships as the Chesa.&#xD;
peake is with canvas-backs in December!"&#xD;
"If you are afraid, you need not go with&#xD;
me, sir "&#xD;
"Me afeard, eap'n ? Did you ever see me&#xD;
beck one inch from anything human, inferna&#xD;
or divine? By jingo, it's time that I left when&#xD;
you twit me with being' a coward! I didn't&#xD;
foresee that!1"&#xD;
"Forgive me, Yarnall; I didn't mean to in&#xD;
sinuate that you were a coward. There's my&#xD;
hand on it. I have ever found you the braves&#xD;
of the brave!"-&#xD;
"Tarnal Jerusalem! I knowed you'd sa3&#xD;
that, cp'n ; and now jest head the craft right&#xD;
for Delaware Capes, and see if Ned Yarnal&#xD;
banks an inch from youe. Jitmnpin' Moses,7&#xD;
know what it is to be in love myself. I love&#xD;
&#xD;
a gal down on the Cape once---loved her worse&#xD;
than p'isen. A Dutch Jew pedlar got ier,&#xD;
though-bought her off from me, after she'd&#xD;
promised to share my fortin, with a sixpenny&#xD;
calico dress and a string of gold beads, and&#xD;
cheatedher at that, for the gold turned green&#xD;
afore she'd been spliced a week. I hain't had&#xD;
notbin' to do with women folks since then.&#xD;
They're like a coral reef' in smooth water-&#xD;
mighty deceivin'. If once you run ashore on .&#xD;
it, you're chawed up in a hurry. The 'Ca'pes,&#xD;
by our last observation, ought to bear about&#xD;
weet-nor'west-distant about one hundred&#xD;
and fifty-odd miles."&#xD;
Yes, you can keep her away. Our course&#xD;
will keep the wind on the quarter. If the&#xD;
breeze lasts, we can slip in in the night, or a&#xD;
little before daylight at least.'&#xD;
" Yes, sir ; but wouldn't it be well to go in&#xD;
shabby like? We ve got enough cargo in of&#xD;
-the right sort to pass as a transport, if any of&#xD;
the Engliehers should overhaul us. If we can&#xD;
get up the river safe, I know a creek on the&#xD;
Jarsey side where we can stow the craft sosafe&#xD;
_ that nothin' can find her from the water side,&#xD;
and nothin' be apt to come from the land&#xD;
without they like wadin' in the swamp. Ie&#xD;
up Rancosas."&#xD;
"We will try and get the craft in there,&#xD;
then. If the worst comes, and we are in dan-&#xD;
ger of being taken, we can run the craft ashore&#xD;
and burn her. Then we can join the Torces&#xD;
on land."&#xD;
"And make boss marines of ourselves,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
LOVE'S STRATAGEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
A short time after Elliott had taken the ne-&#xD;
gro Cato into his service, he was called upon&#xD;
by a smart looking lad, who appeared to be&#xD;
a"out ixteen or seventeen, who asked if he&#xD;
did not want a servant. The young fellow&#xD;
was neatly dressed, and very good looking.&#xD;
his appearan ce rather prepossessed the lieu-&#xD;
tenant in his favor, although there seemed a&#xD;
lttle of the devil in his black eyes.&#xD;
"Why do you seek to enter my service?"&#xD;
asked E iliott.&#xD;
Because I have no home. Iam too young&#xD;
to be a soldier, and want to get an honest liv-&#xD;
ing if I can," said the lad.&#xD;
The answer pleased Elliott. who wished to&#xD;
vie with toe other officers, who mostly had&#xD;
smart looking valets.&#xD;
"What is y our name ?" he asked.&#xD;
"John Jones, sir.'&#xD;
"Were you torn here, my lad?"&#xD;
"No, sir-I cane from New York."&#xD;
"Your language and appearance indicate&#xD;
that you have been in a better situation than&#xD;
that of a servant ny lad.'&#xD;
No matter what I have been-I seek no&#xD;
high position now, sir."&#xD;
Can   ou r-ad and write ?"&#xD;
Passably well, sir."&#xD;
"Do you kr.,w how to dress hair?"&#xD;
"I can dress my "wo, sir and, if'necessary,&#xD;
learn to dress yours."&#xD;
"What wages do you want?"&#xD;
"I leave that to your own generosity, sir."&#xD;
"Well, I will take you as a confidential&#xD;
valet. If yon write a good hand you can act as&#xD;
my copyist, for I have many orders and let-&#xD;
ters to copy for his excellency the general. I&#xD;
believe you can be trusted. You are young,&#xD;
yet you have an honest countenance. Some.&#xD;
how it seems as if I had seen you before.'&#xD;
"I have met 'ou several times in the street,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"That accounts for it. Well, you can enter&#xD;
upon your duties at once. I will show you&#xD;
some letters that require copying} also some&#xD;
orders."&#xD;
The youth whom he had thus taken into his&#xD;
service was slenderand gracefully formed. His&#xD;
complexion was rather dark, bronzed as if'&#xD;
from exposure, while in singular contrast with&#xD;
his dark eyes, his hair, which was curled&#xD;
thickly down his neck, was red.&#xD;
For a few days after he had domiciled him-&#xD;
&#xD;
self under the same roof with Cora Bedford?&#xD;
Elliott refrained from pressing himself much&#xD;
into her company, but in a short time his man-&#xD;
nor became more overbearing and insulting.&#xD;
Nothing but her threats to appeal to the gene-&#xD;
ral restrained him from proceedirg to greater&#xD;
extremities than he did. He had two reasons&#xD;
for fearing her resort to such a measure&#xD;
In the first place, the general was an ardent&#xD;
admirer of beauty, and as heartless a libertine&#xD;
as himself.  Wit  more power, ae might&#xD;
snatch the prize 'bich t' lustrul villain co-&#xD;
veted for himself. Am                   -n, ever eince the fruit&#xD;
basket expose he dread d to have the general,&#xD;
upon whom he depended for advancementeand&#xD;
favor, know anything in regard to his in'r-&#xD;
gues. Elliett was a iemorseless villain, but&#xD;
not a hold one. Cowardice went hand in hand&#xD;
with his treachery in his constitutional char-&#xD;
acter. He could lie, stealandsssassiate, but&#xD;
he could not face an open foe.  As a low&#xD;
cr tninal he could have been a leader-as a  oigh-&#xD;
wayman, he never would have had the courage&#xD;
to have robbed a priest.&#xD;
But though he refrained from actual vi.&#xD;
lnce for a time, be never for an instant devia-&#xD;
ted in his intentions, which he could not fully&#xD;
carry out before the Alderman recovered sif.&#xD;
ciently to be removed to prison, as he had&#xD;
originally intended to have him, procuring the&#xD;
order for his imprisonment by representing to&#xD;
the general that he was an influential and dan-&#xD;
gerous rebel.&#xD;
It need not be wondered, then, that be made&#xD;
frequent and anxious inqu riea in regard to the&#xD;
health of the old gentleman, show ig his aix.&#xD;
iety so plainly that Cora partially stspe ted&#xD;
the reason, and avoided letinag is pkne ted&#xD;
the Alderman was rapidly eonvale cia e-&#xD;
ing the latter to similate a er'rioo' citloe a to,-&#xD;

owner.&#xD;
Perhaps the reader would like to know how&#xD;
Eliza got along under the struntoos of hr&#xD;
mistress, whih she said "tacitotionst her&#xD;
stomach" so much, in regard to the tratmhnt&#xD;
of Corporal Drill and his guard. To give en&#xD;
insight into that matter, it is only necessary&#xD;
to describe one scene between them&#xD;
Drill was seated in a sitting room back of&#xD;
the parlor, and near him was Eliza. Her face&#xD;
had anything but a vinegar aspect, and Eliza,&#xD;
when she looked smiling and pleasant, ws&#xD;
what might be termed a very pretty girl. Hen&#xD;

&#xD;
figure was neat and tidy, and knowing such&#xD;
to be the fact, she did not neglect to dress it&#xD;
well.        -&#xD;
On this occasion Drill looked well-decid-&#xD;
edly comfortable. As usual, he sat as erect in&#xD;
his chair as he would have stood had he been&#xD;
on parade-any other position would have&#xD;
byen uncomfortable to him. in his hand he&#xD;
held a brimming tumbler of hot ryim-punch-&#xD;
a concoction for which he had a great partiali-&#xD;
ty. That it had been mixed by the fair Eliza,&#xD;
may be inferred from the remarks he made&#xD;
on the subject.&#xD;
"Miss Eliza," he said, ripping the punbobat&#xD;
each pause-" Miss Eliza, I ve marched over&#xD;
a good deal of ground in my time, and one&#xD;
thing I've noticed-that is, that there's some&#xD;
one thing that everybody can do better than&#xD;
another. Now, as a drill corporal, there isn t&#xD;
a man that wears a chevron that can bring an&#xD;
awkward squad forward as well as I can. As&#xD;
a guide, or to cover a platoon, devil the better&#xD;
r         man walks than me. But put me in command&#xD;
of a company, and I couldn't say a word. I'd&#xD;
double 'em up, give wicy wary orders, and&#xD;
make a feol of myself."&#xD;
"What put alithat in your mind, corporal ?"&#xD;
"This punch, Eliza-it is sweet as your&#xD;
lips-it sparkles like your eyes-it is as&#xD;
rich colored as your cheeks-it is a prime&#xD;
punch! If this war was over, and I had you&#xD;
for a wife, settled down in snug quarters, and&#xD;
had money enough to stand at ease with the&#xD;
world, and could take a punch like this once&#xD;
in a while and a puff at my pipe, I wouldn't&#xD;
eaange pta's-wimt Kig George"&#xD;
"There, you are again talking about having&#xD;
me for a rife-you know you don't mean it&#xD;
sorporal."&#xD;
"On my hoior a  a soldier, I do."&#xD;
"You-a ove re if you wanted to marry&#xD;
"Don't I l've the ve'y ground you march&#xD;
upon? I'd rtther hear one word fromi your&#xD;
lips than ahalf a dozen of the liveliest marebe&#xD;
that ever came from fife and drum.'&#xD;
-"Actions speak more than words," replie&#xD;
Eliza, pouting. " If you loved me, you would&#xD;
not like to stand guard over me and my poo&#xD;
master and mistress. "&#xD;
"The only reason I like to stay here is be&#xD;
cause lI'm near you. And hesides, I can b&#xD;
kinder in my way thtn.some others would be.&#xD;
"You could be if you would, corporal."&#xD;
"Wby. Miss Etize, don't I disobey order&#xD;
ol'tu. Don't I let you go out and get letters&#xD;
and never taee them to the lietenant, as he or&#xD;
dred.  And don't I let you do jest as yo&#xD;
like?"&#xD;
.But if my master'and mistress were abl&#xD;
to go away-that is, supposing. I say, not th&#xD;
it is so-would you not stop them with yon&#xD;
-     T"'hat wouldbermy duty. I am on pea&#xD;

&#xD;
"Must obey orders, eh? Suppose, now--&#xD;

Eliza Mullebleaf,.spibster, aged two-and-twen-,&#xD;
ty, and not ill-favored nor scrumptious in my&#xD;
manners, being genteelly brought up, should&#xD;
have saved two hundred and seventy pounds&#xD;
from my wages-"&#xD;
"Two hundred and seventy pounds? Fire&#xD;
and gun-flints!"&#xD;
" Don't interrupt me. Two hundred and&#xD;
seventy pounds, and should, in the ardent sper-&#xD;
its of my wirginous affection, say to Corporal&#xD;
Drill, I love you, and will marry 3oit-"&#xD;
"Me? me ?-marry met       wo hundred&#xD;

"Oh finish your punch,and don't interrupt&#xD;

Never mind the conditions ; he'd do it."&#xD;
"Hear me out, will, you ; on condition that&#xD;
he s ould remove the guard, giverthem the&#xD;
countersign, and escort Mr. Bedford and his&#xD;
daughter beyond the 'English lines to a place&#xD;
of safety, where they could be freed from the&#xD;
persecutions of that story puppy. your mas-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"Bombs and explosives ! That would be&#xD;
treason-death the rules of war ! Disobedi-&#xD;
ence of orders! Oh, Miss Eliza, tempt me not&#xD;
-I love you, but tempt me nol!"&#xD;
"IE thought that your love was all words ;&#xD;
oh. how deceitful you men are. You'd make&#xD;
a girl believe you were a dyin' for her, and&#xD;
then all your professions come out catamount&#xD;
to nothing. Oh, corporal, to think that I dI&#xD;
ever be so weak-so supersiilyoos as to con&#xD;
fess my love, and then hear you ta k of duty F&#xD;
Your heart is as hard as the rock of Adaa's,&#xD;
aunt, that Parson Steruhold is ai way a preach--&#xD;

'Don't cry. Miss Eliza-der Eiza, don't&#xD;
carry on so. I aint hard hearted. Make me&#xD;

" YesI will make yon anoher uch  I'll&#xD;

The corporal looked very solemn and sad,&#xD;
and sighed frequently, white sr o was, with a.&#xD;

&#xD;
Anoiner day had passed away. The British&#xD;
general paced to and fco. angrily, in his room.&#xD;
An officer, spurred, his dress covered with mud,&#xD;
and hearing the marks of fatigue, stood un-&#xD;
covered before him.&#xD;
"You found the enemy on the alert, you&#xD;
say, drawn up and prepared to receive you?"&#xD;
""Yes, general, and in advance of the posi-&#xD;
tion which they held when the reconnoisance&#xD;
was wade."&#xD;
"By heaven, there is some traitor in this&#xD;
camp-ay, I fear me, in my own staff, or close-&#xD;
ly, too closely, connected with my person&#xD;
'       My orders were only made known to my staff,&#xD;
the officers who were detailed for the duty.&#xD;
Time after time have we thus been foiled. The&#xD;
enemy gain, by some unknown means,'a fore-&#xD;
knowledge of every movement we make. Our&#xD;
foraging parties are cut off, supplies are inter.&#xD;
cepted, and, instead of being like victors in a&#xD;
captured city, we are more like a besieged&#xD;
army. If I can discover the means by which&#xD;
the enemy are apprised of her movements,&#xD;
neither age nor sex will deter me from execu-&#xD;
ting a fearful vengeance on the head of the&#xD;
offender."&#xD;
_ "If I might he so bold as to speak, gene-&#xD;
ral!" said the officer, who waited, and whose&#xD;
age and scars .ore testimony of long service.&#xD;
"What would you say, colonel.? Speak out&#xD;
y--anv advice just now would be of use."&#xD;
i' would ask your excellency of what&#xD;
benefit to our cause is the possession of this&#xD;
place? It is not so good a harbor, nor is it&#xD;
near so accessible as Baltimore. We are too&#xD;
near the inaccessible ranges of the Allegha-&#xD;
nies, whence the hardy ipountaineers and rifle-&#xD;
men can suddenly issue, sweep away our di.&#xD;
visions, and then retire beyond our reach.&#xD;
The country is such that we cannot forage&#xD;
for subsistence with any degree of sue-&#xD;
cess or safety-nor can we mnamnuvre a large&#xD;
force profitably. Their militia and ranging&#xD;
companies, knowing the ground, and used&#xD;
from boyhood to following game through the&#xD;
great forests, the valleys, over rivers and&#xD;
mountains, have the advantage of our best&#xD;
veterans."&#xD;
"True, Colonel. I have already thought of'&#xD;
evacuating this place, and seeking a more pro.-&#xD;
fitable field of action. If we could only get&#xD;
Washington to condense his army, and meet&#xD;
them at once on a fair field, we could crush&#xD;
him!"&#xD;
"If it is done, it must be done in a hurry,&#xD;
&#xD;
general The French will soon have a large&#xD;
army here."&#xD;
"Poh-I care not for the French. They&#xD;
are like the Hessians, they fight fo ar-but&#xD;
these Continentals and militia-me' tight for&#xD;
freedom, for their homes, their wives, and&#xD;
their little ones, and they fight lar' lto' !&#xD;
"Yes, general I and my regirmet can tes-&#xD;
tify to that, to our cost. But if x'ur excel-&#xD;
lency is done with me, I wil retire&#xD;
" Do so, colonel-you've been toortcen or&#xD;
sixteen hours in the saddle--you tost be fa-&#xD;
tigued."&#xD;
The officer retired, and the ger'at again&#xD;
paced to and fro in the room, ap ertly ab-&#xD;
sorbed in deep study.   His ateuo.iu was&#xD;
aroused by the entrance of Etliott&#xD;
"So, sir, the expedition of last iiht was a&#xD;
failure ?" said the general.-&#xD;
"I regret that it was, your exceileasy," re-&#xD;
plied the former.&#xD;
"And the failure was caused, ev ertlv, by&#xD;
the enemy receiving information frni some&#xD;
one in the secret " said the general crutiniz.&#xD;
ing the young officer closely.&#xD;
"So it would seem-yet few kne w w f it  I&#xD;
knew that the orders sent to me wir, i'hivered&#xD;
in a safe manner into safe hands, y"-rr excel-&#xD;
lency !&#xD;
"Well, the secret will out yet. ' -healkeep&#xD;
a close watch hereafter, and issue ne orders&#xD;
until it is time to execute them. I ,m sick of&#xD;
this inactivity. 'The government.'at home&#xD;
looks to have this accursed rebe li  crushed&#xD;
at once, and we are scarcely holdine 'tr own,&#xD;
much l'ss caking head against the inemy  I&#xD;
shall take the field again soon. It   uropy to&#xD;
keep the troops here in idleness'&#xD;

me when I was on a lark!1"&#xD;
There's some," said the landlord, handing&#xD;
from a back shelf an old dusty bottle, "that&#xD;
no king's officer-no disrespect to the button&#xD;
--ever bad his nose over before."&#xD;
The officer took a hearty "pull at the hal-&#xD;
liards," and turned to leave. As he did so, he,&#xD;
said i ma low'tone:&#xD;
"I leave all the arrangements to ybu, Tom&#xD;
-there must be no such word as fail. Re-&#xD;
member, a hundred pounds down, if all turns&#xD;
out right, and not a farthing if it don't."&#xD;
"Never fear, Master Harry ! I should think&#xD;
I'd done jobs enough for you, to show that&#xD;
I'm no green hand!" said the landlord, as the&#xD;
officer departed. "Yes, many's the gal-"&#xD;
he commenced saying, but stopped as he saw&#xD;
the eye of the younger seaman fixed full upon&#xD;
him, with a singular expression.&#xD;
"Did you speak ?" he asked of the seaman.&#xD;
"No, sir--ut I was just going to tell you&#xD;
to mix me another lot of geog," said the lat-&#xD;
ter, coolly.&#xD;
"Oh, was that ill?" said the landlord, seem-&#xD;
ing easier.&#xD;
"And mix another for my shipmate,;' said&#xD;
the first speaker, again bending his e Yes upon&#xD;
the book, which, had the landlord been able&#xD;
to read, he could have seen was held upside&#xD;
down, for the seaman's mind was anywhere&#xD;
but on its pages.&#xD;
The liquor was soon ready, and laying down&#xD;
his book, the younger seaman rose to take it,&#xD;
calling to his companion to join him  After&#xD;
the glasses were emptied, he said to the land-&#xD;
lord :&#xD;
"Me and -Jim '11 go and take a short cruise,&#xD;
to see how the weather looks, and the like,&#xD;
but well be back soon-mind you save a&#xD;
place for us to bunk in."&#xD;
"All right, my hearties-I've room to stow&#xD;
a ship's crew-them 'ere chaps a loafin' afore&#xD;
the fire don't turn in reglar !" said the land-&#xD;
lord, winking his solitary peeper, and filling a&#xD;
glass of brandy for himself.&#xD;
The seamen now departed, after fishing and&#xD;
relighting their pipes.&#xD;
"It was a lucky thing that we went into that&#xD;
den," said the youngest, in a low tone, this&#xD;
companion, after they had gained the street.&#xD;
"Why, cap'n?'&#xD;
"You saw that officer?"&#xD;
"In course I did, sir, and set him down for&#xD;
one of King George's meanest monkies."&#xD;
"Well, he is one of the most infernal vil-&#xD;
lains that the devil ever hatched. I owe him&#xD;
an old grudge.  I knocked his daylight itet&#xD;
darkness, the last time we met--and now, be-&#xD;
fore I leave the city, it'll he ten chances to one&#xD;
that I send him down to his master, the devil!&#xD;
His visit to the rascally pirate that keeps the&#xD;
den, who appears to be an old co-workeS in&#xD;
&#xD;
deviltry with him, was to arrange for the ab-&#xD;
duction of the very lacy whom I am now&#xD;
periling life an4 liberty to see. Thank God, I&#xD;
learned one thing from his talk---she is here,&#xD;
and as yet she is safe ! I must manage to see&#xD;
her-and between you and me, we'll knock&#xD;
his plans out of shape, and get her away in&#xD;
safety. If it is true that the British intend&#xD;
evacuating the city, we will h~ve to work&#xD;
sharp."&#xD;
"The sharper the better, cap'n--man and&#xD;
boy, Jim Taompson's been used "to sharp&#xD;
work forty years or more&#xD;
Keeping well in the shade of the houses, al-&#xD;
though it was dark anywhere, the couple hur-&#xD;
ried on toward Market street. On arriving at&#xD;
that streetthey paused before a two-story-and-&#xD;
a half brick house, of genteel exterior. The&#xD;
shutters were closed, and no lights visible.&#xD;
"It is not late," said the youngest; "not&#xD;
more than nine o'clock--I'll see if I can be&#xD;
admitted. Be careful not to call me by name&#xD;
-if we go in, remember we are two poor&#xD;
seamen, who want a little assistance "&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir."&#xD;
Toe youngest now knocked at the door.&#xD;
"Who's there? and what do you want?"&#xD;
asked a gruff voice, as the door was opened,&#xD;
ant by the hall lamp a man garbed in the uni-&#xD;
form of a British soldier appeared, holding a&#xD;
musket with fixed bayonet in his hand.&#xD;
"Does CaptainJones, of the ship Argo, stop&#xD;
here ?'" asked the younger, with admirable&#xD;
presence of mind.&#xD;
" No-this is a sick rebel's house-one Bed-&#xD;
ford--and Lieutenant Elliott's quarters," re-&#xD;
plied the soldier, gruffly.&#xD;
"We're at the wrong house, then-we're&#xD;
looking for Cap'n Jones,"-said the other.&#xD;
"What is the matter? who is there?" asked&#xD;
a voice from within.&#xD;
" Onlya couple of men, lookin' for Cap'n&#xD;
Jones, lieutenant," replied the guard.&#xD;
"Tell them to go to the devil!''&#xD;
"Much obliged !" said the first speaker, as&#xD;
the door was slammed ina'his face.&#xD;
"What's to be done now, cap'n?  There's&#xD;
a way around by the alley-only a fence to&#xD;
climb!   Once in, we can see how the land&#xD;
lays !"&#xD;
"No glass bottles broke up on the top of&#xD;
the fence, nor a big dog in tbe garden, I&#xD;
hope !" muttered Thompson. "I helped an&#xD;
officer to run away with a pretty gal, in Lis-&#xD;
bon, once, and between the glass on the wall,&#xD;
and the-dog in the garden, I suffered stem and&#xD;
starn!"&#xD;
"There is no glass, I'm sure ; they're not&#xD;
up to that dodge here yet!" said the officer ;&#xD;
! "probably no dog !"&#xD;
We will now take a look inside of the house,&#xD;
and lee what is going on there.&#xD;

THE MAN-O'-WAR'S-MANS GRUDGE.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
L oVyE AND DUTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Corporal, is it true that the army is agoin'&#xD;
to evaporate the city ?" asked Euza, as she&#xD;
handed him a glass of punch, at about the&#xD;
hour of nine on the evening already described.&#xD;
The non-commissioned officer looked at his&#xD;
glass drained it at a single swallow, and heaved&#xD;
a sigh that seemed to come up from the very&#xD;
soles of his brogans.&#xD;
" Dead, Liza !" he said, with a melancholy&#xD;
sbake of his head. 'March is the word. I&#xD;
W istn the cursed war was over. It's hard to&#xD;
fight with people as speaks the same lingo. If&#xD;
they Was only French, or Dutch, or Spaniards,&#xD;
wouldd hie another thing. That punch was&#xD;
prime. Liza!'&#xD;
"Ill mix you another, corporal ; I not be&#xD;
unkind to you, dcar Drill, though you loveyour&#xD;
duty. as you call it, better than me!"&#xD;
"-D--n the duty !" said the corporal, with&#xD;
an ewp' afis that made her start. "If it&#xD;
wasu t thtt I'd be sure to be caught and shot&#xD;
for a d. erter, I'd let the service find sone&#xD;
other corporal in my place ; burn my primin'&#xD;
if I wouldn't!"&#xD;
"Dear Corporal Drill, oh! if you only would&#xD;
help toy maser and mistress to get away from&#xD;
the hands of that hateful lieutenant, I'd die&#xD;
for you, almost!" And Eliza threw her white&#xD;
arms around the corporal a stiff neck with a&#xD;
fervor that might have choked him had he not&#xD;
been protected by a leathern stock of the con-&#xD;
sistency of sheet iron, and kissed him with a&#xD;
smack that sounded nearly as loud as the re-&#xD;
port of a small r'istol.&#xD;
Visions of matrimony, with infantile accom-&#xD;
panmeints, and especially the two hundred&#xD;
and seventy pounds, flitted before the dazzled&#xD;
vision of the bewildered corporal. What he&#xD;
would have said we know not, for at that crit-&#xD;
ical moment the girl, whose face was toward&#xD;
the window, uttered a scream, and, turning as&#xD;
pale as snow, cried :&#xD;
'Oh, mercy! I saw it! I saw a ghost! 1b&#xD;
rose to condemn me '"&#xD;
'Who? what? Powderand ball ! what is&#xD;
the matter?' cried tie corporal.&#xD;
"Oh! oh' I saw the ghost of a sailor man&#xD;
that I met before you came here this times&#xD;
-it was looking at me right through the win-&#xD;
dow&#xD;
"Ghosts don't look through windows," said&#xD;
the corporal. "I'll call the guard and look for&#xD;
the ghost in the garden."&#xD;
He rushed out oftthe room to do this, and at&#xD;
&#xD;
the same instant the outer door opened and&#xD;
Barney and his companion entered       -&#xD;
"Hide us quietly, my good Eliza, before&#xD;
that red- coat returns !" said the former.&#xD;
"Goodness gracious I" is that you, lieuten-&#xD;
ant? My mistress-"&#xD;
"Not a word now, Eliza, not a word, but&#xD;
hide us. and when he return get him out of&#xD;
the way as soon as you can. Then you can&#xD;
let your mistress know I am here," cried Bar-&#xD;
ney.&#xD;
"Quick, then-get into that cupboard, both&#xD;
of you, and make no noise." said the girl, com-&#xD;
prehending the ghost part now, as she saw the&#xD;
honest faces of the seamen bent upon her.&#xD;
'"Now be careful not to touch the crocker-&#xD;
ary I" added the girl, as she closed the small&#xD;
closet door on them, just in time, for before&#xD;
she could regain her feat, the corporal re-en-&#xD;
tered the room, attended by four of his men,&#xD;
and hurried out into'the yard to look for the&#xD;
ghost.&#xD;
Of course he sought in vain, and found not&#xD;
even a sign of a living being, much less a&#xD;
ghost, if ghosts do leave signs.&#xD;
"I think it must 'ave been a fat ey of yours,&#xD;
Mies 'Liza," said the corporal. "I don't be-&#xD;
lieve in ghosts, but I thought some chap might&#xD;
'ave been in the the yard lookm' in at us-but&#xD;
there's never a feather of one there."&#xD;
"Maybe it was a fancy," said Eliza; "I feel&#xD;
nervous and highetrikey to-night. I guess I'd&#xD;
better go to bed ; we can talk to morrow, you&#xD;
know, dear corporal."&#xD;
"Yes, 'Liza, if tramp is not the word ; but&#xD;
there's no knowin' but what orders may come&#xD;
for us to move in the morning. and if they do,&#xD;
Il have to go with my company, and loss&#xD;
yours, without my master tapes you along with&#xD;
your lady, for her he has sworn to take. I&#xD;
heard him do it when he was talking to himself&#xD;
in his room to-night."&#xD;
"You did? Oh, the horrid beast! I'd tear&#xD;
his eyes out for five pins. But I won't go&#xD;
with him, that's flat."&#xD;
"But with me, dear 'Liza !" and the cor-&#xD;
poral put on an excruciatingly affectionate&#xD;
look.&#xD;
No, nor with you, nor any other red-&#xD;
coat that lives, as long as there's a true&#xD;
Americas blue jacket alive I" she said, raising&#xD;
her voice a very little, for wtat purpose a&#xD;

and the blue jacket."                       Bitter was the look which the corporal east&#xD;

A FIEND IN HUNAN SHAPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Immediately after leaving the commanding&#xD;
general, as described in the twenty-third chap-&#xD;
ter, Elliott repaired to his quarters, and after&#xD;
writing off a single copy of the general order&#xD;
which he had just received, to summon the&#xD;
regimental officers to a council called his vol&#xD;
unteer valet to his side, and bade hint tran-&#xD;
cribe the necessary number of copies, and&#xD;
take them to the officers whom he named&#xD;
"And is it true, then, that the argry is to&#xD;
evacuate ithe city, sir ?" asked the young valet.&#xD;
"It is talked of; curse the idea 1" said te&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
You sec in much attached to the city, sir,'&#xD;
said t tevalet.&#xD;
"Not to the city, but to some one in it, and&#xD;
whom I must get ort of it if we leave. You&#xD;
seem to b- a lad of ready wit, I wonder the t&#xD;
you have nit discovered my secret crc tbia&#xD;
If by tihe secret, sir, you ro an your pa;&#xD;
aion for the lidy under this roof,it is io secret&#xD;
to me, nor ht r aversion to you  Both I have&#xD;
already served ; but a still tongue hetolkens&#xD;
a sentile head, and keep my own counsels.'&#xD;
"Then, as you are so observing, and to dis-&#xD;
creet withal, know you not of a plan by which,&#xD;
if we move, I can transport her to New York&#xD;
unbeknown to the cilicers, and get her even&#xD;
more n my power than she now is?"&#xD;
"It is for 3ou to plan, sir; I am only your&#xD;
servant, ready to obey orders.'&#xD;
Tbe valet spoke calmly and meekly, yet bad&#xD;
Eliott been a good judge ofthumaui nat ore, his&#xD;
suspicions must have been aroused by the&#xD;
manner in which the youth evidently sough&#xD;
to learn his plans.&#xD;
"I have forced a plan, my good Jones, and&#xD;
I shall need some one to see it faithfully exe-&#xD;
cuted. You have been ready and faithfu), so&#xD;
far, in my service, and to you I think I can&#xD;
entrust the delicate mission."&#xD;
"Am I too bold, sir, if I ask the plan you&#xD;
propose ? '&#xD;
" No ; it is necessary that you should know&#xD;
it. I have determined to remove her to a small&#xD;
&#xD;
vessel . hick I shall charter, and send it&#xD;
around to New York either before us or ac-&#xD;
companying the transport vessels. The ab-&#xD;
ducti;n from this house will occur in my ab-&#xD;
sence, and be so conducted that I shall appear&#xD;
to have nothing to ao with it."&#xD;
"But whom can you trust, sir? Not your&#xD;
drunken corporal and'his guard."&#xD;
l oy n means. I have a trusty fellow, one&#xD;
Tow Rifey, engaged, who has done many an&#xD;
odd job for me, and he will get good men to&#xD;
aid him. All that I wish you to do is to super-&#xD;
%ise toe matter, and then to accompany him&#xD;
to see that no harm befalls her, for among such&#xD;
a rough set there is no knowing what might&#xD;
be dr e."&#xD;
IHol Eiliott seen the lah which darkened&#xD;
the ceek, and the shuddet which shook the&#xD;
for u. of the  outh, when Riley's name was&#xD;
menirned, 1e might have suspected danger,&#xD;
but he did not.&#xD;
" Wnat think you of the plan, Jones?" he&#xD;
cowinied.&#xD;
-' If Exertet as wtaiell as it is laid, sir, it can-.&#xD;
not fitl; but I must hasten with these orders."&#xD;
"True, my lad, and I will spend an hour&#xD;
with the fair Cora. It is a pleasure for me to&#xD;
tease Oer; the day is not far distant when I&#xD;
will bumble her rebel pride ; when on her&#xD;
bended knees she will sue to be my wife.&#xD;
hasten with the orders, Jones, and be secret."&#xD;
Certainly, air ; as recret as the grave," and&#xD;
the va'et at once commenced his duties.&#xD;
ELbiott now entered the parlor of the man&#xD;
sion. No one seemed to be in it; for though&#xD;
dimly lighted, his eye could scan every part&#xD;
of it.        *&#xD;
"With herrebel father, I suppose, as usual,"&#xD;
be muttered. " If she is not in soon I will ring&#xD;
for her impudent maid, and send for her."&#xD;
So saying, he cast himself down upon the&#xD;
old fashioned sofa. Hardly had he touched it,&#xD;
when a grunt so loud and unearthly came from&#xD;
underneath it, that he bounded at a singleleap&#xD;
to the centre of the floor. He was speechless&#xD;

both with surprise and terror. At the same&#xD;
moment a black head with two great protrud-&#xD;
ing eyes stuck out from beneath the sofa, like&#xD;
the head of a ninety year old snapping turtle&#xD;
emerging from its bell.&#xD;
 "The devil !" muttered Elliott.&#xD;
"Ki Massa, you a-most sqush ole nigger !"&#xD;
said a voice issuing from the head, and then&#xD;
the misshapen form of old Cato dragged itself&#xD;
into light.&#xD;
S"W hat were you doingunder thatsofa, you&#xD;
black rascal "&#xD;
"I creep in dere, massa, for try catch um&#xD;
sleep a lilly bit. Ole nigger no tink de sofa so&#xD;
low nasy bump he back."&#xD;
Well, never try that bunk again. Now go&#xD;
into Mr. Bedford's room and tell Miss Cora&#xD;
that I wish to see her on special business, and&#xD;
then crawl off your ugly careassinto the entry,&#xD;
and sleep on the mat if you want to."&#xD;
"Yes, massa, Ki, you a'most squash ole&#xD;
nigger dat time."&#xD;
In a short time after the negro left, Miss Bed-&#xD;
ford entered. Etuott a-ose and proffered a&#xD;
seat, wbich, with a gesture of calm dignity,&#xD;
she refused&#xD;
"You sent me word that you wished to see&#xD;
me on business, sir. Business matters require&#xD;
but fe w wo t3s " -&#xD;
"Yet, fair Cora, mine requires many ; nay,&#xD;
turn not away, this may be the last conversa-&#xD;
tion that we shall ever have in this city."&#xD;
If I thought such would be the case, I&#xD;
should listen to the last conversation with&#xD;
pleasure." replied the spirit ed gill.&#xD;
"It probably will be. Our army is about to&#xD;
evacuate the city."&#xD;
"It is? Then our hole Washington is ap-&#xD;
proaching. He yet will conquer."&#xD;
"Perhaps; but now, Miss Bedford, you will&#xD;
sit down and converse with me for a little&#xD;
while, will you not ?'&#xD;
" Yes ; but ,I hope that on this occasion you&#xD;
will forbear your usual insults, and endeavor&#xD;
to act the man, if not the gentleman.-I would&#xD;
not be sounreasonableas to ask you to attempt&#xD;
the latter character," continued the lady, as&#xD;
she took a chair at come distance from the&#xD;
sofa.&#xD;
"Ever cruel, ever satirical, beautiful Cora,'&#xD;
said the uilicer, trying to assume a calm and&#xD;
gentle tone, w  ich his every look belied.&#xD;
"You had better proceed with your busi-&#xD;
ness, and forbear your disgusting and fulsom&#xD;
flatteries, w bich come to me like the exhala&#xD;
tions of a hennel." -&#xD;
"My husitees! Cora Bedford, I have bu&#xD;

"No ; a thousand times no!"&#xD;
"Would you not if I would desert the king's&#xD;
cause, and east my sword and influence on the&#xD;
side of the rebels r'&#xD;
"Would you do that? Would you be a trai-&#xD;
tor a second time, and doubly perjure and&#xD;
damn yourself?"&#xD;
"To win you I would do anytfdg, say,&#xD;
shall my sword and influence be the price of&#xD;
your hand ?"&#xD;
"No, you poor poltroon, no! One is weaker&#xD;
than the wooden truncheon of a fool, the other&#xD;
more valueless in a good cause than dust in&#xD;
the air."&#xD;
"Will you give me your reasons for this&#xD;
scorn and hatred 1"'&#xD;
"Yes. First, you are a coward-an imita-&#xD;
tion of a man-destitute of principle honor,&#xD;
truth, everything which can enforce respector&#xD;
win regard.. You are a low tory, a black-&#xD;
hearted s'dueer, a contemptible libertine !&#xD;
-Marry you! sooner would I clasp the'fout fiend&#xD;
of hell to roy breast than cali you husband !"&#xD;
"Cora Bedford !" cried the officer, his face&#xD;
purple with passion, and his voice husky with&#xD;
rage, "you have sealed your own fate. You&#xD;
are now in my power-never shall you escape&#xD;
from it. Trink you 1 was serious when, but a&#xD;
moment since. I asked you to lwcome my wife?&#xD;
No, I did but taunt you with my words.&#xD;
Within one week you shall be my--"&#xD;
He arose, bent his mouth to her ear, and, in&#xD;
a whisper, hissed the word wbich lie scarce&#xD;
dared to speak aloud. Quick as the flash of a&#xD;
warrior a sword when it cleaves to a foetan's&#xD;
skull, her small, white hand swept through the&#xD;
air, and smote him so shortly upon the cheek&#xD;
that lie fairly reeled herieath the blow.&#xD;
In a moment, his hand was upon his sword&#xD;
She quailed not, but rose, and, with folded&#xD;
arms, looked him in the face, and cried:&#xD;
"Strike, you coward! You, who dare-not&#xD;
face a man, asrikel"&#xD;
He paled before her indignant glance. He&#xD;
did not draw his sword,'but, with a bitter look,&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
"To-morrow, proud girl, you shall sing&#xD;
another tune. This night rest, if you can; I&#xD;
, shall, for I am wearied ; but mark you now,&#xD;
your fate is sealed. Neither heaven nor hell&#xD;
- neither angels nor fiends. %an save you ?"&#xD;
e He turned and departed, and she listened tr&#xD;

- than she had felt that nitht. But after he was&#xD;
e gone, her calmness, her courage, her haughty&#xD;
r pride gave way, and she sank upon the sofa,&#xD;
and, bowing her face in her far, soft banda,&#xD;
wept bitterly-sobbed as\ if her heart waa&#xD;

&#xD;
Among the British forces, the next day, im-&#xD;
portant preparations were made for some se-&#xD;
rious movement. Althoughthe orders had been&#xD;
kept studiously secret, yet in some manner the&#xD;
rumor had gone abroad that the city was to&#xD;
be evacuated. There was gladness on the faces&#xD;
of many of the citizens, which they scarcely&#xD;
made an attempt to conceal, while others-&#xD;
rank tories at heart-looked sad and distrustful,&#xD;
for they knew that the departure of the Brit-&#xD;
ish army, and the re-occupation of the city by&#xD;
the Americans, would bring them no good.&#xD;
Another class felt even more sadly-the liquor&#xD;
dealers and the panderers to licentious vices&#xD;
and pleasures, who ever hang like' jackals&#xD;
about an army when it is at rest-for they&#xD;
knew that the well fed, well clad, and well paid&#xD;
ritish army,.would be replaced by an army&#xD;
.  bich, though patriotie,had neither leisure for&#xD;
ilulgence,nor moneys to dissipate. Never be-&#xD;
tre. since nations have held a right to be con-&#xD;
fidered civilized, has a war been carried on&#xD;
y  iti les financial assistance than was our Revo-&#xD;
lution. Officers served not only without pay,&#xD;
but beggared themselves to clothe and feed&#xD;
their troops. With bare, feet, unmurmuring&#xD;
troops marched over frozen clods and icy&#xD;
ground, leaving their own blood upon the trail.&#xD;
' Men who had not a blanket to rest upon at&#xD;
night, nor a tent to shelter them from wind&#xD;
and rain, still struggled on, hoping to free their&#xD;
country from the thraldom- of tyranny. And&#xD;
through indomitable energy, unwavering per-&#xD;
severance, and a patriotism which no danger&#xD;
could appal, no reverses discourage, by the&#xD;
aid of Almighty God, they succeeded. We&#xD;
became a nation among nations-a star of&#xD;
liberty in a sky once darkened with the rain-&#xD;
cloud of oppression. And how have we-their&#xD;
descendants-repaid those noble men for their&#xD;
sacrifices? Go look at the squabbles of our&#xD;
leaders in the Senate chamber and in the Con-&#xD;
gressional halls! Go look at the leaders, for-&#xD;
getting country and party ; and even party and&#xD;
self. only workingto fill their coffers with spoils&#xD;
from the people, and not for the public honor&#xD;
or good-for a reply ! Go ask for the graves&#xD;
of your Revolutionary sires ! they are un-&#xD;
marked-even the memory of their deeds is&#xD;
passing away ! Alas! that such things should be&#xD;
but they are!&#xD;
&#xD;
It was noon. Riley, the landlord, had an&#xD;
interview with Elliott, whose plans were laid&#xD;
for the abduction to take place at midnight&#xD;
on that night. The latter had chartered a&#xD;
small, swift-sailing vessel, leaving the manning&#xD;
of her entirely to Riley, as well as the manage-&#xD;
ment, only providing that hisvalet, John Jones,&#xD;
was to take charge of the lady, and attend to&#xD;
her wants and her disposal on the arrival of&#xD;
the vessel. Riley, glad to get a crew on such&#xD;
easy terms, had accepted the services of tae&#xD;
disguised Barney, and seven of his asso-&#xD;
ciates, who had already been on board of&#xD;
their new craft, and seen that she was prepar-&#xD;
ed for sea.&#xD;
She was a very pretty schooner, built very&#xD;
sharp, for those days, though not exactly v hat&#xD;
would be termed a clipper at this time. She&#xD;
was built for sailing in shoal water, but had&#xD;
very nice accommodations, having been the&#xD;
yacht of Mr. Robert Morris, the~ financial&#xD;
savior of his country. Barney saw at a&#xD;
glance that, bad she been a little Heavier-she&#xD;
was only about forty tons' measurement-she&#xD;
would have made an invaluable cruiser for the&#xD;
bay and river,-if well manned. She had been&#xD;
seized and confiscated by the British when the&#xD;
city was taken. She had been named "The&#xD;
Mary" by the original owner, after bis beau-&#xD;
tiful and amiable bride, who had been Miss&#xD;
Mary White, the belle of the city.&#xD;
Attached to the vessel was a swift-rowing&#xD;
gig. Barney had managed to have a good&#xD;
supply of arms and/ammunition concealed on&#xD;
board, and his men, beside, had armsconcealed&#xD;
on their persons.&#xD;
During the day he managed to exchange&#xD;
signals, unobserved, with his lady love; and,&#xD;
though their hearts trembled with anxiety,&#xD;
they felt confident of success. Each party&#xD;
deemed their plans perfect, and such as could&#xD;
not be overthrown.&#xD;
As night drew on, it was generally rumored&#xD;
that, guarded by the men.of-war and strong&#xD;
flanking columns, the transports would move&#xD;
down the river on the morrow, and the city be&#xD;
evacuated.&#xD;
Evening, with its darkening shadows, came&#xD;
on, and came early, for a storm was setting&#xD;
in. Although it was June, a cold northeast&#xD;
wind swept in with heavy clouds, and every-&#xD;

E&#xD;
&#xD;
fit,&#xD;
&#xD;
thing looked chill and gloomy. Barney,&#xD;
however, was pleased with the aspect of the&#xD;
weather; it wounO render his movements more&#xD;
easy, his digun-e more safe, and, with the&#xD;
wind as it was, he could lay up the river with&#xD;
the wind, close hauled, or scud down it if he&#xD;
wished.&#xD;
He alone, of all the Mary's erew, was per.&#xD;
fitted to reman on shore during the even-&#xD;
ing, by .il y; wo made a kind of mate of&#xD;
him, in conseqienite 'of his apparent supe-&#xD;
rior intel'1taenee. The landlord, knowing how&#xD;
fond seamen were of grog, and not knowing&#xD;
his customers, thought it a matter of wisdom&#xD;
to keep them where they would not be tempt-&#xD;
ed to indulge to excess before he needed them&#xD;
for action.&#xD;
"It's going to be a nasty night, sir," said&#xD;
Barney to in, as they looked out from the&#xD;
door of the old tavern.&#xD;
"Yes, but all the better for us," said Riley.&#xD;
"If the gel should tate it into her head to&#xD;
squall. it 1 be sharp ears that would hear her&#xD;
en such a night as this. Fewer people will&#xD;
be abroad, and when once we're aboard the&#xD;
schooner, we'll run down the river under&#xD;
&#xD;
such a breeze, as if the devil had kicked us on&#xD;
end!"&#xD;
"Isn't it nearly time we went on board, to&#xD;
get the men ready, sir ?"&#xD;
-  No, not for two hours yet," said the land-&#xD;
lord, glancing at a huge bull's-eye which he&#xD;
drew frota his wateh-fob; then, squinting to'&#xD;
windward with his one eye, he uttered : ""It-ll&#xD;
blow a snorter to-night. I reckon a couple of&#xD;
horns won't set us back for the night's work,&#xD;
my lad."&#xD;
Suiting the action to the word, the landlord&#xD;
mixed a couple of stiffeners of grog for himself&#xD;
and Barney, and then lighted his pipe. His&#xD;
substitute behind the bar was like himself in&#xD;
one respect, and singular in all others. He&#xD;
had lost an eye, aleo a leg and arm, and went&#xD;
under the name of " One-sided Jack," Like&#xD;
most men who have been deprived of a portion.&#xD;
of their limbs, he was unusually active with&#xD;
what had been left to him., He had been a&#xD;
kind of useful pensioner to Riley, and took&#xD;
charge of matters for him at all times when the&#xD;
latter was called from hia post by inclination&#xD;
or business.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
?NE cOaPORAL MIsSED.&#xD;
&#xD;
It wa sea-y on the metig of thiasday,-when,&#xD;
anxious cni reRtless. Elliott, having risen&#xD;
from  his bld, called for the corporal of the&#xD;
guard to re'-iv. hii usual report. Cato, whom&#xD;
he had sent fir tiat purpose, soon returned,&#xD;
and, with a  road grin upon his sable face,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Corporal ro dare, massa-him gone."&#xD;
" Gine-the devil 1"&#xD;
"0 e bigger iot know, massa, if him gone&#xD;
to de dei or nit-he not nowhar now."&#xD;
Seid one of the otrer soldiers to me, and&#xD;
make haste, you black imp !"&#xD;
In a shirt time one of the other soldiers&#xD;
made his appearance.&#xD;
"Woere i. Corporal Drill? Why is he ab-&#xD;
sent from his post ?"&#xD;
I do not know, sir," replied the soldier,&#xD;
saluting.  'It- hs not been even since ten or&#xD;
eleven o'clock last nigbt, 'when he called us out&#xD;
to look for a ghost that Miss Bedford's maid&#xD;
Taw     o       go&#xD;
"To look for a ghost? What sort of acook&#xD;
&#xD;
and bull story is that you are teliag? Art,&#xD;
you drunk?"&#xD;
" No, lieutenant. At about the time I name,&#xD;
he came out of the room where he had been&#xD;
sitting with her, and called four of us to&#xD;
go into the yard with him to see if any one&#xD;
was there. The woman had been frightened,&#xD;
he said, by what she thought was the ghost&#xD;
of a sailor looking in at the window. He&#xD;
thought there was some one in the yard, but&#xD;
there was no one, nor any sign of any one.&#xD;
We looked carefully. He should have relieved&#xD;
guard at midnight, but he did not, and the-&#xD;
sentinel called his relief himself. The cor-&#xD;
poral has not been to his bed during the&#xD;
night."&#xD;
'Why did you not tell me of this earlier ?"&#xD;
"Because we were in' hopes the corporal&#xD;
would return before you were up, sir. He is&#xD;
always very regular."&#xD;
"Always was till he got in love with that&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
It can hardly be that he has deserted,"&#xD;
muttered Elliott. thoughtfully. "Have you&#xD;
asked the waivng maid anout him?"&#xD;
"Yes; sir; she says he left her right away&#xD;
after we searched the yard."&#xD;
"S e may know where he went to; send&#xD;
her to me, and wine she is here, search her&#xD;
room. A man makes a fool of himself when&#xD;
he is in love wili a woman, sometimes.''&#xD;
The solier saluted again, and departed to&#xD;
obey his orders.&#xD;
"Strage !" muttered Elliort, as he paced to&#xD;
and fro in the room. " I cannot thin that&#xD;
Drill nas deserted, but that woman may have&#xD;
induced him to do it. I will soon learn "&#xD;
In a few moments Etiza entered the room.&#xD;
Her face was as demure as that of s country&#xD;
maiden in church when she hears her banns&#xD;
read fo' the fire, time.&#xD;
"Did the lieutenant instruct the soldier to&#xD;
say that I was wanted i" she asked.&#xD;
" "He did. Wnat story is this about a ghost&#xD;
that I bear?' demanded Elliott, fixing his&#xD;
eyes keenly upon tier, to read, if possible, any&#xD;
change in her countenance.&#xD;
"On, the ghost. Well, sir, I don't hardly&#xD;
believe. on desidera'ion this morning, that it&#xD;
was a gt at  I think, as the corporal did,&#xD;
that it was a phantaswy of the imagination.&#xD;
You see, sir, I am rather nervous. and-tie&#xD;
corpora', sir, was speakrig on a very delicate&#xD;
subj-et sir-one very affectations to a young&#xD;
and unprtected female girilike me, sir-when&#xD;
all to ovine I thought I saw the face of an old&#xD;
sweetheart looing at me through the window,&#xD;
andIscreeceed right out. Then the corporal&#xD;
be swo'e, sir, and got the men and went and&#xD;
looked fir the ghost, bit couldn't find it And&#xD;
that's alt I know about the ghost, sir."&#xD;
"But not all ttat you know about the cor-&#xD;
poral  W hohec      of him after that?"&#xD;
"The Lord only knows, sir. He oniysopped&#xD;
to take a single giaes of punch after be sent&#xD;
the men away; then he went out of the room,&#xD;
and I took my candle and went to bed"&#xD;
"Did you go aone-eh, my fair wench ?"&#xD;
"Alone, Mr. Elliott? What do you mean&#xD;
sir?" ~&#xD;
"I mean that I wish a reply to my question&#xD;
Did you go alone to your room, or did th&#xD;
corpor al go with you?"&#xD;
" Tne corporal go with me ? Oh, you scor&#xD;

At this moment the soldier whom he ha&#xD;
ordered to search Fliz 'a room returned, hold&#xD;
ing in his hand a red fgetet. The single chew&#xD;
ron on toe sleeve, below theelbow, proclaime&#xD;
at once that it belonged to the corporal.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
THE ABDUCTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was eleven o'clock. The storm raged&#xD;
wildly-whistling through the streets and al-&#xD;
leys of the town, or through the rigging of&#xD;
the vessels at the wharves, almost winterishly.&#xD;
The "all's well" of the sentinels, as they&#xD;
paced their weary rounds, muffled up in their&#xD;
thick watch coats, could scarcely be heard&#xD;
from post to post. Here and there a light&#xD;
could be seen in the town, but most of the&#xD;
houses had been darkened, for on such a&#xD;
dreary night people seldom love to keep late&#xD;
hours&#xD;
At this hour, a boat, rowed by six men, with&#xD;
a seventh sitting in the stern sheets, to steer&#xD;
her, pushed from the side of a schooner an-&#xD;
chored close over by the island, opposite Market&#xD;
street, and pulled in for the wharf. Upon en-&#xD;
tering the dock, and reaching the landing, four&#xD;
of the men who rere in the boat followed him&#xD;
who was in the stern sheets, and sprang on the&#xD;
wharf. The other two were directed to remain&#xD;
with the boat.j&#xD;
As soon as they landed, Riley, for he was&#xD;
the leader, gatheredthe men, and, in a whisper,&#xD;
gave his final directions. It had been settled&#xD;
that Elliott should, if Miss Bedford had re-&#xD;
tired to her room-which Barney knew she&#xD;
would do, for he had so arranged it with her&#xD;
as to meet all of Elliott's plans-that he was&#xD;
to show a single light from a northern window&#xD;
in the house. Upon the party entering the&#xD;
house, the sentinel, who was also under in-&#xD;
structions, was, without noise or resistance, to&#xD;
suffer himself to be seized, gagged, and bound.&#xD;
They were then to hasten to the apartment of&#xD;
the lady, muffle her up in her clothing, if she&#xD;
had reired, hasten with her to the boat, and&#xD;
carry her on board the vessel. Elliott was not&#xD;
to be seen, or appear to know anything of the&#xD;
&#xD;
affair, nor was his valet, until he joined the&#xD;
party on board the schooner.&#xD;
All this was now fully explained to the&#xD;
men, who had, of course, already received their&#xD;
orders from Barney, after which, Riley, giving&#xD;
each man a drink of grog from a huge pocket&#xD;
flask which he carried in his pocket, moved&#xD;
onward. Their steps were slow and stealthy&#xD;
-not a man of the party spoke above his&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
On this occasion, the front door of the house&#xD;
was left unlocked, and everything "worked to&#xD;
a charm." Scarcely any noise was made in&#xD;
securing the sentinel, and then, headed by Ri-&#xD;
ley, Barney and one other, hastenod to the&#xD;
apartment of the lady.&#xD;
Barney had expected to find her up and&#xD;
ready to be willingly abducted. What was&#xD;
his astonishment, however, to find her sleeping&#xD;
so soundly that the noise of their entrance did&#xD;
not awaken her,&#xD;
"I reckon the lieutenant has drugged her&#xD;
on purpose, so that she'll make no bother for&#xD;
us," suggested Riley, as he reached out to&#xD;
take her in his arms.&#xD;
Here, let me carry her, I am the strongest&#xD;
of the party," said Barney, as without a glance&#xD;
himself, or without permitting the others to&#xD;
look upon the form of her whom he loved, he&#xD;
quickly wrapped the quilt and sheets around&#xD;
her, and raised her tenderly, as if she were a&#xD;
babe, in his powerful arms. He took occasion&#xD;
to whisper, to her whom he supposed to be&#xD;
simulating asleep, "Fear not, my angel."&#xD;
"Are we not to take the old gentleman&#xD;
along, too," asked Barney.r.&#xD;
"No-we're not to bother with him," said&#xD;
Riley. "Hurry off-the girl is all that I'm&#xD;
to be paid for."&#xD;
&#xD;

" Poh! I was not speaking of myself. By  "It shall be done, sir."  And the valet re-&#xD;
the way, be ready for the matter to-night, of tired.&#xD;
which I spoke to you last right. I will set-  "I like that Jones," said Elliott, after he&#xD;
tle that affair to-night, and have it off my had left the room. "He is so prompt and&#xD;
mind."                                    ready, and seems so faithful. He has such a&#xD;

"None until after I have breakfasted. You  if so, I cannot remember where. I never&#xD;
can order my horse to be in readiness then--I knew any Jones except old Jones the pawn-&#xD;
shall ride."                               broker."&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MAN-O'-WAR'a&#xD;
Barney would have insisted upon taking her&#xD;
father, but he dared not risk theething, and he&#xD;
knew that Elliott would not dare to harm him&#xD;
after Cora was gone, so he hurried out with&#xD;
his fair burden-hastening all the faster, as a&#xD;
singular noise betokened that the house was&#xD;
*      alarmed. As he passed from the door, he saw&#xD;
rushing, or rather staggering into the entry,&#xD;
Corporal Drill, so pale, and covered with ashes,&#xD;
that he looked more like a drunken miller,&#xD;
than a soldier in his Britannic Majesty's ser-&#xD;
vice.&#xD;
There was no time for a second glance. The&#xD;
lungs of the corporal were in full play, and&#xD;
the party rushed for the boat, Jim Thompson&#xD;
very carefully and considerately, helping Bar-&#xD;
ney with his burden.&#xD;
In a few minutes, the party were at the boat.&#xD;
"Pass her down to the stern sheets-all's&#xD;
safe now," said Riley, gleefully.&#xD;
"Let me handle her, I'll do it gently, sir,&#xD;
so as not to weaken her," said Barney, stepping&#xD;
carefully into the boat, and drawing the cloth-&#xD;
ing more carefully around her form, to keep&#xD;
the chill wind and spray from her.&#xD;
"All right-but you're uncommon careful&#xD;
of property that's nothing to you," muttered&#xD;
Riley.&#xD;
"She's a woman, and were she to wake in&#xD;
terror, and commence screaming, it might give&#xD;
us trouble yet," said Barney, who almost itched&#xD;
to tell the heartless wretch how dearly he&#xD;
prized the 'property" which he held in his&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"Shove off. It's deuced strange the lieu-&#xD;
tenant's valet isn't here-but I'm not going to&#xD;
wait for him"&#xD;
"Hole on dah, Massa Riley, please, jest one&#xD;
minnit, for ole nigger," said a grum voice,&#xD;
speaking as if its utterer had been on a run-&#xD;
- "Massa Elliott, he sen' ole nigger to wait on&#xD;
lady, and said he couldn't spare Massa Jones&#xD;
jest yet."&#xD;
"Why, it's Elliott's crooked nigger, a pretty&#xD;
looking thing to wait on a lady, butI suppose&#xD;
its all right. Tumble into the bows there,&#xD;
Ebony-Knot."&#xD;
"Yes, massa! Ki, massa, you come so fast,&#xD;
it make ole nigger sweat."&#xD;
"Yes-I can tell that easy, by the wind,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said the landlord, as the boat moved out from&#xD;
the pier.&#xD;
In a few moments they were alongside the&#xD;
sohooner, and Barney, who from the start had&#xD;
not let the lady pass from his arms, stepped on&#xD;
board, and carried the lady carefully down into&#xD;
the state-room which had been prepared for&#xD;
her. . Laying her carefully on the bed, he re-&#xD;
turned to the vessel's deck. He had no op-&#xD;
portunity to speak tp her, for Riley was at&#xD;
his side or heels all the time.&#xD;
"So far, sogood," said Riley, as they all&#xD;
stood on the deck. "Now we'll take a nipper&#xD;
all around, and then we'll get under way"&#xD;
To this Barney made no objection, and as he&#xD;
did not, of course the crew assented. Who&#xD;
ever knew a sailor to refuse a glass of grog?.,&#xD;
Inthose days, too, everybody took their today,&#xD;
from the king to the peasant, from the parson&#xD;
to the grave-digger. It was only a matter of&#xD;
economy, then, twat made Franklina temper-&#xD;
ance man. Don't think, however, cold-water-&#xD;
istical reader, that I mean disrespect to the&#xD;
temperance cause ; no, indeed-by the thin&#xD;
shadow of John Chambers I vow I do not.&#xD;
After a hearty "nip" had been taben all&#xD;
around, the sails, or at least all she could bear,&#xD;
a double-reefed mainsail, foresail and jib, with&#xD;
the bonnets off, were loosed, and the anchor&#xD;
as noiselessly as possible. In less time almost&#xD;
than it takes for me to describe it, the vessel&#xD;
was moving down the river. It had been Bar-&#xD;
ney's intention to take charge of her at once,&#xD;
and go up the river, so as to reach his own&#xD;
vessel, and the sooner get within the Aneri-&#xD;
can lines, but the wind had veered more to&#xD;
the northward, and blew so freshly, that he&#xD;
abandoned the design, and made up his mind&#xD;
to run down the river, and hide away in a&#xD;
creek or river until the city was evacuated,&#xD;
and the British had left the waters of the&#xD;
Delaware.&#xD;
The river in front of the city, and for some&#xD;
distance below, was quite thickly filled with&#xD;
vessels, but as lights were hoisted on board,&#xD;
it was easy to avoid them, and they swept on&#xD;
without being hailed'   Had they been, it&#xD;
would not have mattered, for Riley had the&#xD;
pass word. We will now leave them, and re-&#xD;
turn to the city for a while.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
WOMAN'S KINDNBas.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some women are by nature so amiable that&#xD;
they nver looked cross in their lives, much&#xD;
lees uterred a harsh word.  Some are so gen-&#xD;
tle, that it they were to catch a flea in the&#xD;
act or pu cturiog a vein, and withdrawig&#xD;
from e et, their tair sin a portion of the&#xD;
ruby wit,- of Pte, they would not move, for&#xD;
fear of di-turibiog the earnuverous wretch,&#xD;
until he tad fitted himself, and then gently,&#xD;
very Gently, they would removo him and put&#xD;
him on a piece of perfumed note paper to&#xD;

such women.&#xD;
Somr- tore are,l know, whose answer to an&#xD;
unkind 1o0 or a rough word is a tear. Some&#xD;
there are s gentle and so good that a sore-&#xD;
headed rear would go beyond his nature if&#xD;
he was to ice cross to them. A man-a true&#xD;
ian-woulds ooner swallow a live rattle.&#xD;
mnate, lead first, than do it.&#xD;
Some t here are with the very devil in their&#xD;
nature. thunder on their tongues  lightning&#xD;
in their eyes, and a hail storm on their breath&#xD;
They sn- er when they want to smile, they&#xD;
grin when they want to laugh. Wnen they&#xD;
weer' it is riot ice the good hearty shower of&#xD;
April or May-it is like the half frozen drizzle&#xD;

hearts Darn them (as the gal said about the&#xD;
ragged stockings) darn them, up hill and&#xD;
down, all over creation.&#xD;
Some there are-dear, . blessed, good old&#xD;
maids-so patient, so kind, so neat, so fond&#xD;
of giving cakes and goodies to little children,&#xD;
so ready to nurse the sick, so ready to sacrifice&#xD;
their own ease to add tothe comfort or others,&#xD;
so pious, without always shoving a Bible or&#xD;
tract under your nose and asking you for money&#xD;
to buy blankets for the liottento's, so ready to&#xD;
make up a quarrel that has unnecessarily oc-&#xD;
curred between a young giirl ano her lover, so&#xD;
blessedly useful everywhere that the man&#xD;
who would breathe a word against them ought&#xD;
to be swallowed by the Belgian giant just be-&#xD;

I always think of such old maids as I do in&#xD;

so God leaves such old maids husbandless,&#xD;
that they can be universally motherly, sister-&#xD;
ly, etc.&#xD;
But avast-Ned, what are you about.&#xD;
Reader, really I beg pardon for writing so&#xD;
much about woman nature, a master in which&#xD;
I have so little experience. But the subse-&#xD;
quert matter of this enapter will show you&#xD;
what set me into the train of thought which&#xD;
elicited the above.&#xD;
During the entire day after the morning's&#xD;
interview with Elliott; Eliza had found her-&#xD;
self so closely watched that she had no oppor-&#xD;
tunity to go down into the cellar to see how&#xD;
the prisoner in the ash-hole got along. Of&#xD;
course she knew that, so tightly bound and&#xD;
gagged, he must suffer, but angered and an-&#xD;
noyed as she was, perhaps she didn't care.&#xD;
Sne supposed he was safe, and as she never&#xD;
had cared tor him particularly in her heart,&#xD;
it is not to be supposed that thoughts of his&#xD;
sufferings lay very heavy in her bosom. She&#xD;
was occupied, too, in making, all as carefully&#xD;
as she could, without attracting notice, prepa-&#xD;
rations for the intended es.'ape of her mistress,&#xD;
of wnieh she was fully informed. She wished&#xD;
much to accompany her lady, but this had&#xD;
been canvassed and thought improper, as it&#xD;
would not tally with the rest of the plan. It&#xD;
had been ordered, to make things work better,&#xD;
that she should retire early, so as not to ap-'&#xD;
pear to know anything 0f the abduction before&#xD;

Pausini for a moment to recover the use of&#xD;
them, and for the pain to subside, he planned&#xD;
his future actions. Putting his hand in a&#xD;
pocket, lie drew forth a small knife, and with&#xD;
its aid he soon had the gag out of his mouth,&#xD;
and his feet were free.&#xD;
"Curse her-I'll fix her off for the trick, the&#xD;
false-hearted jade, as sure as I'm a corporal!&#xD;

He now attempted to rise, but at first he&#xD;
could not stand. After resting a little while,&#xD;
and permitting circulation to resume its course,&#xD;
he was able to get up, and taking the light, he&#xD;
staggered up stairs. His first visit was to the&#xD;
closet where Eliza kept the rum bottle. A&#xD;
hearty swig at this soon made him a little&#xD;
more elastic, but he could hardly navigate,&#xD;
when he put the candle down asd went to&#xD;
visit the guard. As he opened the door which&#xD;
led into the entry, he saw that it was filled&#xD;

lover, and saw that one had a female in his&#xD;
arn .&#xD;
' Treason! Robbery! Guard, turn out!"&#xD;
he shouted.&#xD;
His cries aroused the whole house, and in a&#xD;
few moments all the soldiers were standing&#xD;
around him, looking at his singular figure, and&#xD;
asking where he came from, and what was the&#xD;
matter.&#xD;
At the same moment another person from&#xD;
outside was added to the group. It was none&#xD;
other than Elliott, who, having seen the party&#xD;
of seamen issuing with their prize from the&#xD;
house, supposed that all was right, and now&#xD;
advanced to inquire into the cause of the up-&#xD;
roar, which he supposed he could unfathom&#xD;
more readily than any one there.&#xD;
Where have you been, sir? Drunk as&#xD;
usual ?" he asked, with difficulty restraining a&#xD;
laugh ac he looked at the extraordinary figure&#xD;
of the corporal.&#xD;
"Not drunk, sir !" cried the corporal, bring&#xD;
ing his hanl up to a salute, with a jerk which&#xD;
threw a:thes into the eyes of his nearest neigh-&#xD;
bars ; " not drunk, sir, but most damnably&#xD;
abused! '&#xD;
'What is the meaning of this uproar?'&#xD;
"Why. sir, after I escaped from my confine-&#xD;
ment in the ash hole, I saw as I came to alarm&#xD;
the guard. a party of soldiers here in the entry,&#xD;
and they were carrying off a lady-Miss Bed-&#xD;
ford, I suppose-and I, as in duty bound,&#xD;
raised the guard&#xD;
" On. is tbat all? If neor  hoose to carrv&#xD;
&#xD;
tenant, with assumed carelessness ; but ere he&#xD;
had finished what he intended to say, a change&#xD;
came over the spiritof his dream, and a shadow&#xD;
fell upon "the light of his countenance." This&#xD;
was occasioned by the appearance of an addi-&#xD;
tion to the group in the shape of Miss Cora&#xD;
Bedford and her maid Eliza, who, with can-&#xD;
dles in their hands, and fully dressed, came&#xD;
out from the direction of their rooms.&#xD;
"What means this mummery? Are you en-&#xD;
joying a masquerade?" asked Cora, of Elliott,&#xD;
who gazed upon her as if he could hardly be-&#xD;
lieve his eyes, and realise that she stood before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Miss-Bedford !" he stammered, "really&#xD;
-I-I thought you had retired !"&#xD;
"No, sir, I had not, and from the noise out&#xD;
here supposed the house was on fire !"&#xD;
Alas ! poor Cora, she did not tell all the&#xD;
truth, but it be-and-bye will come out, we&#xD;
suppose. Detained through an artifice which&#xD;
ahe could not  plain, or for what purpose&#xD;
she knew not, by being locked in a room near&#xD;
that of Eliza, to which she went by request of&#xD;
the negro Cato, to see "Massa Jones jeat for&#xD;
one mnnit," as he said, she had been unable&#xD;
until a fe-v minutes before, to escape. She had&#xD;
had been liberated Eliza, whose attention she&#xD;
had attracted, and had hastened down on hear-&#xD;
ing the noise, supposing that it was caused by&#xD;
the intended movement of Barney. St e, too,&#xD;
was almost as much surprised as Elliott was,&#xD;
by the arpearauce of matters, although both&#xD;
her and Eliza knew why Corporal Drill looked&#xD;
as he did, though neither could account for his&#xD;
release.&#xD;
What Elliott thought could not at that mo-&#xD;
ment be ascertained, for a mounted ordely rode&#xD;
up to the door and cried:&#xD;
" lieutenant Elliott is wanted at headquar-&#xD;
ters instantly."&#xD;
Toe imperative order, as well as the tone in&#xD;
which it was given by the mounted orderly,&#xD;
showed Elliott that an instant obedience was&#xD;
required.&#xD;
" You wilt oblidge me, Miss Bedford, by re-&#xD;
turning to your room. Corporal Drill, you&#xD;
will clean yourself and prepare to give an ac-&#xD;
count of yourself. on my return. In the mean-&#xD;
time, the whole guard will keep watch, and by&#xD;
no means suffer any person either to enter or&#xD;
leave the house during my absence."&#xD;
Having given these orders rapidly, and in a&#xD;
tone of impatience, he turned off and hastened&#xD;
toward Gen. Howe's headquarters, wonderir g&#xD;
what he could ha want" foir at that ko,,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
THE DISCLOSURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Eleven was an eventful hour on that night.&#xD;
The British General had spent the evening in&#xD;
examining maps and charts, and preparing for&#xD;
the movement determined for the next day. A&#xD;
large number of transports and vessels of war&#xD;
were ready to move and guard the troops ansd&#xD;
munitions and stores, which the general&#xD;
wished to do before a French squadron, even&#xD;
then expected off the coast, could arrive with&#xD;
additional men and arms for Washington. He&#xD;
knew well that when the Americans were&#xD;
strengthened by such an additional force, his&#xD;
position, hemmed in in Philadelphia, and&#xD;
blockaded by a squadron in the bay, or his re-&#xD;
treat by water cut off, would be anything but&#xD;
pleasant. And he knew the necessity of cele-.&#xD;
rity in his movements.&#xD;
Several members of his staff were with him,,&#xD;
and various orders had been despatched during&#xD;
the evening ; also several messages from dif&#xD;
ferent .commands had been received.  The&#xD;
general was about to dismiss his officers, and&#xD;
retire to rest, when an officer, covered witti&#xD;
dust, and evidently fatigued with rapid riding,&#xD;
came in, and hardly using the ceremony to sa-&#xD;
lute the general, banded him an open despatch.&#xD;
The general s brow contracted as his eye&#xD;
glanced over it, and his face, which first as-&#xD;
sumed a look of surprise and astonishment,&#xD;
reddened into'anger.&#xD;
"George Washington never sleeps!" he mut-&#xD;
tered. Then turning to the officer who had&#xD;
borne the despatch, he asked :&#xD;
"When did the heavy artillery move, of&#xD;
which this note speaks ?''&#xD;
"It commenced to move, we have learned&#xD;
by an escaped prisoner, before daltght, sir."&#xD;
"And this cespatch says that the enemy,&#xD;
gathering in their light troops and outposts,&#xD;
are moving toward the city."&#xD;
"it is correct, sir !"&#xD;
" When did they commence this move-&#xD;
ment ?"&#xD;
"Also at daylight, sir."&#xD;
"Had they been previously making any pre-&#xD;
parations, as if intending to attack us here ?'&#xD;
"None, general."&#xD;
"Then, by Heaven, Washington has been&#xD;
informed of our intention to evacuate the city.&#xD;
That heavy artillery has been moved so rapid-&#xD;
ly, that is may be used on the river below, to&#xD;
annoy our retreat, and he has advanced so that&#xD;
he can enter the city in triumph, the moment&#xD;
we leave it. Our whole plan of operations&#xD;
must be changed. We must march through&#xD;
&#xD;
New Jersey. But how could the news of my&#xD;
intended movement have reached him? In no&#xD;
way but by treason ! Where," he exclaimed,&#xD;
angrily, as he turned toward his staff, "where&#xD;
is Lieutenant Elliott ?"&#xD;
"Gone to his quarters, general," replied&#xD;
the officer.&#xD;
"Despktch an orderly for him instantly, and&#xD;
gallop to the officers of division and counter-&#xD;
mand the marching and embarkation orders.&#xD;
We will not move to-morrow !"&#xD;
Pacing to and fro, chafing like an angry lion&#xD;
in his den, Elliott found the general when he&#xD;
arrived.&#xD;
"So, sir !" cried the latter, "matters of im-&#xD;
portance entrusted to your care, have again&#xD;
reached the quarters of the enemy, even as&#xD;
soon as they were divulged to our own&#xD;
troops."&#xD;
"I do not understaud you, general !  Surely&#xD;
you do not mean that I am at fault '&#xD;
' Did I not entrust  you tie ordering to-&#xD;
gether of the Council o Officers?'&#xD;
"You did, sir, and 1  t ey ed it. Whatever&#xD;
the decision of your cou cil was, I know not--&#xD;
all orders that came to me catae sealed, and&#xD;
were so delivered,"&#xD;
"Did you deliver them all in person ?"&#xD;
"No, general. My servant. John Jones, a&#xD;
very faithful and confidential young man, de-&#xD;
livered a portion of them."&#xD;
"Ah--he did! Where ,is he now ?'&#xD;
"At my quarters, sir; if you wish, I will&#xD;
order him to come into your presence."&#xD;
"Stay here, sir--I 'will seni for him. Let&#xD;
an orderly be despatched for this John Joi es,&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
Eliott felt the anger of the general very se-&#xD;
verely, yet still more did be regret the mis&#xD;
carriage of his attempted abduction of Cora&#xD;
Bedford, for which he could in no manner ac-&#xD;
count. He had seen the seamen leave the&#xD;
house--a female was borne away by them To&#xD;
this, both- his eyes and those of the corporal&#xD;
testified. Who could she have been ? how&#xD;
could Riley, ever before-so artistic and careful&#xD;
in carrying out his plots of villany, be de-&#xD;
ceived?&#xD;
/ In a short time the orderly seat for Jones&#xD;
returned with the information. that the valet&#xD;
could not be found. Re, however, handed a&#xD;
letter to Elliott, saying :&#xD;
"Your corporal, sir, told inc that this letter,&#xD;
directed to you,, air, was found on the young&#xD;
man's table."&#xD;

THE MAN-O'-WAR S-MAN S GRUDGE.         69&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
THE SURPRISE AND CAPTURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I suppose the reader would like to take a&#xD;
glance at "The Mary" and her crew. Well,&#xD;
come aboard&#xD;
As the .reader is aware, it was about the&#xD;
mid hour of the night when sail was made&#xD;
upon the gallant little craft. The wind blew&#xD;
so fresh, and, as it generally is in the river,&#xD;
blew so freshly withal, that the few hands had&#xD;
to keep on deck during the night. Although&#xD;
Barney knew the channel full as well, and&#xD;
probably better, than Riley, the latter was&#xD;
not aware of the fact, and.-consequently kept&#xD;
his station aft by the helmsman, giving his&#xD;
orders, and frequently taking a drop of comfort&#xD;
from his capacious rum flask. When the gray&#xD;
dawn of the morning came fogily out from&#xD;
the caverns of night, the schooner bias well&#xD;
down the river, but the wind was dying away,&#xD;
and when the sun rose it bid fair to go down&#xD;
altogether. Barney did not regret this much,&#xD;
for hie was near the creek in which he intend-&#xD;
ed to, secrete the schooner, but he regretted&#xD;
more that a British frigate lav at anchor not&#xD;
more than three or four miles below them,&#xD;
and altogether too' near the creek to please&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Ae ihe schooner's sails began to flap i the&#xD;
wind idly, and the wind to decrease, Riley&#xD;
took another pull at his flask, and offered it&#xD;
to Ba -iey, who was steering. The latter did&#xD;
not refuse the proflered beverage..&#xD;
"I reckon I'll go below and see how the&#xD;
gal go's along. It's strange she hasn't made&#xD;
any moise. Harry must have drugged her&#xD;
heavy. He's a known' one for that; he had&#xD;
a gal at my house once that slept three days&#xD;
afore nhe knowed where she was, or what had&#xD;
come of her."&#xD;
"The villain " muttered Barney.&#xD;
"Oh, he paid well-I'll always say that&#xD;
of him," said Riley, starting to go into the&#xD;
cabin.&#xD;
"Stop !" said Barney, suddenly stepping be-&#xD;
fore hi in, and beckoning to Jim Thompson to&#xD;
take tie helm.&#xD;
"W ny, what's up!" said Riley, angrily, at-&#xD;
tempt'nrg to pass on.&#xD;
" I mean," said Barney, giving him a shove&#xD;
that ,sent him reeling against the taifrail,&#xD;
"that I am master here, and that if you at-&#xD;
tempt to enter that eahin without my permis-i&#xD;
sion, I u pitch you overboard. I owe you-a&#xD;
grudge for being employed by such a dirty&#xD;
villain in such dirty work, but out of regard&#xD;
to soma of your kind ways, if you'll behave&#xD;
&#xD;
yourself, you shall have all the grub and grog&#xD;
you want, and when I get ready I'll put you&#xD;
ashore, or land you in Philadelphia after the&#xD;
British have left."&#xD;
"You're mighty considerate for a foremast&#xD;
hand, you are" said Riley, in astonishment.&#xD;
"Who the hell are you ?"&#xD;
"Lieutenant Barney, of the Continental ser-&#xD;
vice, at your command, Mr. Tom Riley, and&#xD;
this is the flag that I sail under." said Barney,&#xD;
drawing out a small American flag from his bo-&#xD;
som; "and as soon as we're out of sight&#xD;
of that cursed frigate, yonder, I intend to host&#xD;
it on this my lawful prize. The crew all be-&#xD;
long to my own good craft, the Sachem."&#xD;
"Regularly taken in and done for," groaned&#xD;
Riley. "Five hundred pounds gone- to the&#xD;
devil! Who'd have thought Tom Riley was&#xD;
such a d--d half-witted fool as to be done&#xD;
this way ?"&#xD;
The c edcvant landlord sat down on the edge&#xD;
of the transom, and, heaving a deep sign, toou&#xD;
a very long pull at his rum flask, then looked&#xD;
at the frigate, looming up with her black sides&#xD;
and   avy spars in ,e distance.&#xD;
"Ii you'll pro 'se to take things easy,&#xD;
make no signals, and behave .yourself lice a&#xD;
man, I'll not confine you," said Barney ;&#xD;
obtaIrwiseit will be necessary for me to put you&#xD;
out of the way of troubling, or bringing&#xD;
trouble upon me"&#xD;
"I can't do nothin' but promise," said Riley,&#xD;
sulkily. "You've got me,,and I can't help&#xD;
myself," as the-rat said to the trap."&#xD;
"And now," said Barney, "I11 go below&#xD;
and see how the lady ic-perhaps she'd rather&#xD;
see me than you. You brought her clothes&#xD;
along, did you not, Thompson ?"&#xD;
"If you mean them are things as you tossed&#xD;
me from the chair, when you picked me up,&#xD;
sir, they're in the state-room-I hove 'em in&#xD;
there when you laid her'down."&#xD;
"Then, if she has awakened from her stu-&#xD;
por, she can dress," said Iarney, as he de-&#xD;
scended into the cabin...&#xD;
The negro Cato lay coiled up in front of the&#xD;
state-room door, so close that it could not be&#xD;
opened without arousing him wereehe asleep.&#xD;
But this was not the case, for he half rose up&#xD;
as Barney approached.&#xD;
"Is the lady awake yet?" asked the officer.&#xD;
"Me jest hear um stir, sah," said the negro.&#xD;
Barney knocked against the door gently.&#xD;
"I will make my appearance in a moment,"&#xD;
said a voice from within.&#xD;
&#xD;

70             THE MAN-O'-WAR S-MAN'S GRUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Barney started at the sound. It was a lady's&#xD;
voice, but to his ear it did not sound like the&#xD;
well  inemembered  tones of Miss Bedford.&#xD;
Whatever his doubts were, they were speedily&#xD;
solved by the appearance of the lady, who to&#xD;
him was an utter stranger.&#xD;
'You are not Mess Bedford!" he said, in&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"No, rir !'" she said, in a haughty tone, "and&#xD;
you may tell y our master that Miss Bedford is&#xD;
safe from his power."&#xD;
"My master, madam? I own no master but&#xD;
the Comnander.in chief of the forces of the&#xD;
United States, trom w hom I hold my commis-&#xD;
sion."            ,&#xD;
What, sir ! Are you not a tool of Henr&#xD;
Elliott s, employed to abduct Miss Bedford?"&#xD;
"I am ro tool of hie, though I supposed&#xD;
that 1 was rescuing Miss Bedford from his&#xD;
power. I am her dearest friend. If she were&#xD;
here she would be safe. But, my God, where&#xD;
is she now ?"&#xD;
"Safe, sir-fear notfor her. I left her lock-&#xD;
ed up in a room in her lather's house, and not&#xD;
knowing that she had a friend near him to foil&#xD;
him in his infamous designs, I took her place,&#xD;
and suffered myself to be abducted without&#xD;
resistance, for I fear him not. He would rather&#xD;
meet the foul fiend himself than to face Caro-&#xD;
line Ormsley, for I have sworn to effect his&#xD;
ruin, and I will accomplish my oath. Fear&#xD;
not for your friend Miss Bedford. Elliott is,&#xD;
probably, moving with the troops long before&#xD;
this time, supposir'g that his scheme of ab-&#xD;
duction has succeeded, and that he will find&#xD;
his intended victim in New York. I had in-&#xD;
tended to meet him there, and let him sup-&#xD;
pose, till the last moment, that I was Mies&#xD;
Bedford. But now you will sooner meet the&#xD;
lady if you change your course. I can reach&#xD;
New York ea-ily, and, under another guise,&#xD;
carry out my intentions, for never will I rest&#xD;
while he lives."&#xD;
"Lady. I thank you sincerely for your no-&#xD;
ble act and generous intentions, and Cora her-&#xD;
self will thank you. While you are on board&#xD;
this vessel, eveiy wish of yours shall be grati-&#xD;
fied. I regret there is no female servant on&#xD;
board to wait upon you."&#xD;
"I have no need of any," she said, with a'&#xD;
sad smile. "That faithful slave has been my&#xD;
only servant for a long time," she added, as&#xD;
she pointed to Cato, who showed at least a&#xD;
six inch double row of ivory as he looked up&#xD;
at her.&#xD;
" Cap'n. I've an idea you'd better come on&#xD;
deck," said Thompson, from above ; "we're&#xD;
driftin' down to'rds the frigate uncomfortable&#xD;
fast, and a boat is shoving' off from her:"&#xD;
"Excuse me, lady," said Barney, bowing ;&#xD;
"I must attend to my duty. Have no fears for&#xD;
your safety, but for the present, please remain&#xD;
below."&#xD;
"I will do as you wish, sir," she replied, as&#xD;
he hastened on deck.&#xD;
&#xD;
When he got the-e, he found. as Thompseoi&#xD;
said, that the schooner was. drifring "nncom-&#xD;
fortable" near to the frigate. Tae wind had&#xD;
died away, and a strong ebb tide was running&#xD;
out  Tnu schooner was in easy gun shot of&#xD;
the frigate, and nearing her every moment.&#xD;
Beside, a boat had left her, and was pulling&#xD;
toward the schooner.&#xD;
Barney ins antly ordered thc sails lowered&#xD;
and the anchor to be let go.  He then caused&#xD;
the English flag to be hoisted at the usual&#xD;
place, on the main topping lift.&#xD;
Then turning to Riley, who sat looking at&#xD;
the approaching boat with undisguised pleas-&#xD;
ure, he asked :&#xD;
"Have you any particular fondness for a&#xD;
sudden death, Mr. Riley ?"&#xD;
"Can't say that I have-'specially jest now,&#xD;
when the prospect of them five hundred&#xD;
pounds is se much better than it was a little&#xD;
while ago," said Riley, with a sudden grin.&#xD;
"Your prospect of short shrift and a sud-&#xD;
den death is a great deal better," said Barney,&#xD;
showing the butt of a pistol, and looking him&#xD;
firmly in the eye.&#xD;
"God ! Why, man, you would'nt murder&#xD;
me ?"&#xD;
"Listen to me, Tom Riley. I'am a man&#xD;
who never lied-neither to my worst foe nor&#xD;
my best friend. So help me God, if you diso-&#xD;
bey me in one particular, I will blow your&#xD;
brains out the moment you do it. Take com-&#xD;
mend of this vessel now, as if we were all&#xD;
Englishmen, and still your crew, as you sup-&#xD;
posed when we started. When that boat&#xD;
comes alongside, show the officer your pass,&#xD;
and tell him your business, just as you would&#xD;
have done, had nothing happened. If you&#xD;

you do not, you are a dead man."&#xD;
"I'll do it," said Riley, turning a little pale,&#xD;
for he saw death in Barney's eye-and then he&#xD;
took a good long pull at his flask, to strength-&#xD;
en his nerves.&#xD;
In a few moments the boat was alongside.&#xD;
Riley stood aft, assuming all the importance&#xD;
of a skipper, while Barney was sufficiently&#xD;
near to fulfil his threat if he saw the least&#xD;
sign of treachery on his part.&#xD;
"What vessel is this, and where bound P"&#xD;
asked the English lieutenant, as he stepped on&#xD;
board.&#xD;
"The private schooner Mary, Captain Tom&#xD;
Riley, of Philadelphia, with property of Lieut.&#xD;
Elliott, aid to Gen. Howe, on board-also the&#xD;
lieutenant's wife," said Riley, quite pompous-&#xD;

the same time glancing rather sharply at Bar-&#xD;

The latter felt uneasy, for the face of the&#xD;
officer seemed very familiar to him.&#xD;
"Yes, sir-here's the pass. In course I&#xD;

course not," said Riley, exhibiting the paper.&#xD;

" Thank you, Miss Cora; that sense of duty&#xD;

wind, as my recent adventure shows. I may&#xD;

and take the chances which fortune may throw&#xD;
in my way."&#xD;
Cora did not speak while she listened to his&#xD;
remarks, but her beautiful eyes told him that&#xD;
she appreciated his noble and honorable sen-&#xD;
timents.&#xD;
" Well, at least you can stay to dinner," said&#xD;
the Alderman, not at all liking the araumenta&#xD;
which indicated the coming loss of Barney's&#xD;
Company.&#xD;
"If Mr Morley thinks it compatible with&#xD;
his duty, I shall not object," said Barney.&#xD;
"We have the whole day before us," said&#xD;
the English officer, 'and I certainly shall not&#xD;
mar its pleasure by hurrying Lieut. Barney&#xD;
away from such agreeable company. I have&#xD;
several friends in the army whom I wish to&#xD;
see, and I will call on them."&#xD;
"Oh, you must not leave us-you'must he,&#xD;
one of our dinner party," said the Alderman.&#xD;
" Water affording us so much pleasure in&#xD;
bringing one friend to see us, it would be&#xD;
really unkind, sir, not to give us a proper op-&#xD;
portunity to thank you," said Cora, blushing&#xD;
beneath the adrpiring but respectful gaze of&#xD;
Morley.&#xD;
"Many thanks, fair lady ; I will go for a&#xD;
time, and return in season to partake of your&#xD;
hospitality," said Morley. whose delicacy told&#xD;
him that nothing would he more agreeable'to&#xD;

"I hope from my heart, sir, that this war&#xD;
will soon be over," said the young officer,&#xD;
warmly. "It seems so unnatural to fight&#xD;

who were born with the same affinities, who.&#xD;
are used to the same customs !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said the Alderman; "it is very&#xD;

taken place, "to warn you to be on you- guard&#xD;

eyes on him. We shall soon evacuate the city&#xD;

"Ill keep a suaderbuss for the rascal!"&#xD;
said the alderman. "I'm getting strong now&#xD;
-and if he hangs around afteryour army has&#xD;
left, I'll have him arrested as a tory dog, sir,&#xD;
and hung, if I can. Ah, captain, there were&#xD;
three British institutions which have been&#xD;
abolished in this country, which I admired&#xD;
very much-very much, sir ; they were so ad-&#xD;
mirably adapted to such fellows as that Elli-&#xD;
ott. He was brought before me once in my&#xD;
magisterial capacity, and I stated .then in&#xD;
court, sir, my regret that I could only fine&#xD;
him. But Barney had punished him already,&#xD;
sir-,-had committed a justifiable assault and&#xD;
battery on him. You remember it, don't you,&#xD;
my lad?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Barney-"not only be-&#xD;
cause I inflicted a richly merited chastisement&#xD;
on the villain, but because it was the occasion&#xD;
of my introduction to-yourself and daughter."&#xD;
As he spoke he glanced at Cora, with a look&#xD;
which threw the rich blood up into her cheeks&#xD;
up to her very temples.I&#xD;
" May I asks Alderman, what those institu-1&#xD;
tions were which you regretted had been abol-&#xD;
ished?" asked Hurlbut&#xD;
"The whipping-post, the ducking -stool and&#xD;
the pillory, sair; Christian institutions, sir, in-&#xD;

as;Elliott. Tnere are fellows, sir, who don't&#xD;
care a rap for a fine or impriso ment ; but,&#xD;
souse them under water, or give them forty,&#xD;
save one, on the bare back, and you touch&#xD;
their consciences, sir i"&#xD;
"Is it probable that the army will move&#xD;
from the city soon, air ?" asked Cora, timidly,&#xD;
&#xD;
76&#xD;
&#xD;
for she felt, mo' e than any other jinnoyed at&#xD;
the vicinity of such a vile, unscrupulous vil-&#xD;
lain as Elliott.&#xD;
"We are under marching orders now, lady.&#xD;
Probably to-morrow, or next day at the latest,&#xD;
the column will move over into New Jersey.&#xD;
His excellence the general has made no con-&#xD;
cealment of his line of march, aid probably&#xD;
we shall have a battle."&#xD;
"Whatever may be its result-and I do not&#xD;
deny that my wishes and prayers are on the&#xD;
American side-I hope, sir, that you, who&#xD;
have been so kind to us, will pass through it&#xD;
unscathed," said Cora, in a tone of deep feel-&#xD;

So. do I-so do I, sir. You are a gentle-&#xD;
man, sir-one of my own school. I like you.&#xD;
You must dine with us, sir, to-day- That ras-&#xD;
cal Eiliott and his drunken guard made sad&#xD;
havoc with my wine bin, but I have some&#xD;
crusty old port left."&#xD;
"I thank you from my heart, fair lady, and&#xD;
you, kind sir, for youi good wishes and the&#xD;
invitation. Were all rebels like you, I fear&#xD;
that but little dependence could be placed on&#xD;
our army--at least on the gentlemen in it. Un-&#xD;
de' such temptations, I fear they would forget&#xD;
their loyalty," and he bowed low to the love-&#xD;
ly girl as he spoke.&#xD;
"Don't flatter the girl, captain;" said the&#xD;
Alderman; "I can't spare ber yet, and when&#xD;
I do, I suppose that fellow Barney, there, will&#xD;
take her under his wing. Oh, you needn't&#xD;
blush so,-either of you!" And the Alderman&#xD;
chuckled over the confusion which his off-&#xD;
handed remark brought upon both of them.&#xD;
"Envy is not a part of my nature, or I&#xD;
should surely grudge the lieutenant so fair a&#xD;
prize," said Morley, bound to have his oar in&#xD;
the water. "But his lot carries out the poet's&#xD;
thought-'none but the brave deserve the&#xD;
fair.'"&#xD;
Both officers (English) now rose, and, prom-&#xD;
ising to return at dinner-time, left.&#xD;
It would be rude and very uneourteous for&#xD;
us, reader, to remain with Barney and his&#xD;
lady love when we know that, both being&#xD;
deeply in love, and wanting to tell each other&#xD;
so, they would rather be alone ; so let us leave&#xD;
them, and slide off somewhere else, and see&#xD;
what our other characters are doing.&#xD;

THE MAN-O -WAR'S-MAN'S GRUDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
THE TWO VILLAINS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tom Riley was not in very good humor&#xD;
when he was set on shore Trom the Arethusa.&#xD;
He had two causes to be put out-in fact three&#xD;
of them. First, his trip and its consequent of&#xD;
five hundred pounds in pocket was brought&#xD;
to a sudden stop ; next, the vesselhaving been&#xD;
taken from him by Barney and his crew, and&#xD;
retaken by the boat from the Arethusa, was&#xD;
now held as a lawful prize to the frigate ;&#xD;
lastly, as the ministers sometimes say, he had&#xD;
received more kicks than half-pence, more&#xD;
curses than blessings, while aboard the vessel:&#xD;
for men-o'-war's-men don't like landlords, ex-&#xD;
cept when they are ashore on a spree, and&#xD;
during the entire Revolution tories were des-&#xD;
pised even by those on whose side they fought&#xD;
or acted. This is a notorious fact.&#xD;
Riley was ready for a growl the moment he&#xD;
entered his house. He had his lips set for it,&#xD;
and only wanted a glass or two of his rum to&#xD;
set nim going.  In fact, the article which he&#xD;
kept for his common run of customers would&#xD;
have made a deacon growl just before a good&#xD;
dinner.  But the individual whom he left in&#xD;
charge when he started on his trip gave him&#xD;
no time for an outburst, for as soon as he ert-&#xD;
tered, that worthy, who was seated on a bar-&#xD;
rel-head, and who evinced no surprise what-&#xD;
ever at his unexpected appearance-in fact,&#xD;
"One-sided Jack" was never known to evince&#xD;
surprise at anything-jerked the stump of his&#xD;
left arm toward the door of the inner room,&#xD;
and said :&#xD;
"There's a chap in there that's been goin'&#xD;
on awful about you. You hadn't better go&#xD;
in "&#xD;
"Hadn't better go in, eh ?  If he was the&#xD;
devil himself, I'd go in now! I never wanted&#xD;
a fight so bad in my life ! Give me a pint mug&#xD;
of that old brandy, you lop-sided curse!"&#xD;
Jack squinted his one eye at Riley, grinned&#xD;
all over one side of his face, and with his only&#xD;
flipper drew the required liquor, which, though&#xD;
it was fourth proof, being kept for his own&#xD;
private use, Riley swallowed at a breath with-&#xD;
out a wink. Then turning to the door, he&#xD;
did not wait to open it according to his usual&#xD;
custom, but kicked it open.&#xD;
Dressed in a shabby suit, with a slouched&#xD;
hat drawn down over his eyes, a cigar in his&#xD;
mouth, and an empty glass before him, sat a&#xD;
man whom Riley did not recognize.&#xD;
"Who the h-1 are you, that's anxious for&#xD;
&#xD;
a mues with Tom Riley ?" he cried, looking '&#xD;
daggers through his one eye.&#xD;
"Why, Tom, are you back? By Jove, I d&#xD;
rather see you than a king !" cried the man,&#xD;
springing to his feet. "Don't you know me,&#xD;
man? Give me your hand !"&#xD;
"Why, it can't be-no-yes, it is ! Is it&#xD;
you, Master Harry ?" said Riley, scarcely be-&#xD;
lieving the truth of vision in his one optic.&#xD;
"Yes, it's me, Tom."&#xD;
"And why don't you curse me-I've lost&#xD;
your vessel!"&#xD;
"D-n the vessels!"&#xD;
"And the gal came ashore, too, as soon as&#xD;
the frigate dropped her mud hook."&#xD;
"The girl? why, you didn't carry her off !"&#xD;
"Yes, but we did, though. I had her all&#xD;
safe aboard, but the men I had turned out to&#xD;
be d-d Yankees, under a chap that called&#xD;
himself Lieutenant Barney. They took the&#xD;
craft from us, and then, when we lay becalm-&#xD;
ed under the guns of the Arethusa, she sent a&#xD;
boat, and Barney had to give up."&#xD;
"What kind of a looking girl was it that&#xD;
you had on board ?" asked Elliott.&#xD;
"Well, she was a little taller than common,&#xD;
had a smart, saucy-lookin' face, and eyes as&#xD;
black as a bottle, and twice as bright."&#xD;
"Caroline Ormsley, by Jove ! her descrip-&#xD;
tion to a dot !"&#xD;
"Well, -we found her in bed in the very&#xD;
room you told us to go to, and she never kick-&#xD;
ed a kick nor squalled a squall when we. car-&#xD;
ried her off."&#xD;
"No-she had her own reasons for not re-&#xD;
sisting. And you say she is on shore ?"&#xD;
"Yes-came ashore with a crooked cub of&#xD;
a nigger, afore I did."&#xD;
"Then I must be on my guard. She is&#xD;
more dangerous than fifty men, and she has&#xD;
sworn to ruin me. She has well nigh done it&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Why don't you split her wizzen, then?"&#xD;
"I will, if ever I get her in my power&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"But why don't you wear your uniform?&#xD;
What are you rigged out so shabby for?&#xD;
That's the why I didn't know you."&#xD;
"It's soo long a story to tell now. I've left&#xD;
the king's service, and that girl is the cause&#xD;
of it. And now I'll have revenge on both of&#xD;
them. I'll humble the one and kill the other,&#xD;
or die in trying it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose I lose my five hundred pounds, that Cora Beaford is afelin my power., We&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
A SOCIAL DINNER.&#xD;
&#xD;
In olden times, dinners-that is, ceremonial&#xD;
ones--were far more substantial than they are&#xD;
now. People met in those days to eat&#xD;
and to drink ; now-a-days they meet to&#xD;
pay compliments, utter sentiments, and&#xD;
make long-winded speeches.  On this occa-&#xD;
sion, in honor of his guest, Alderman Bed-&#xD;
ford was determined that nothing should&#xD;
be wanting. Wisely leaving Barney and Cora&#xD;
to pass the forenoon by themselves, he gave&#xD;
directions in all matters appertaining to the&#xD;
banquet. Therefore it may be supposed that&#xD;
when Morley and Hurlbut arrived at two&#xD;
o'clpck, the dining hour-the one used to the&#xD;
hard fare of a sea-going ship, the other to the&#xD;
exigencies of a mess table in war time--they&#xD;
were not at all displeased to find a table lite-&#xD;
rally laden down with fish, flesh. fowl, and&#xD;
their accompaniments.  Both officers noted&#xD;
that the faces of both Cora and Barney were&#xD;
beaming with joy, when the jolly voice of the&#xD;
alderman summoned them from an inner par-&#xD;
lor to take a seat at the table. They evident-&#xD;
ly had enjoyed the morning-probabty had&#xD;
settled all the future which was at their dis-&#xD;
posal-for we know how thruthful is the&#xD;
adage, "Man proposes, but God disposes."&#xD;
"Fall to at once, gentlemen," said the Al-&#xD;
derman.   "I'm a Christian man and a magis-&#xD;
trate, but I leave the saying of 'grace' to the&#xD;
parsons, whose trade it is. I never wait to&#xD;
be fashionable. When I'm well, I eat because&#xD;
it does me good and I like it ; when I'm sick,&#xD;
&#xD;
I eat all I can to try and get better. Fall to,&#xD;
Mr. Morley-and you, Captain Hlurlbut., We&#xD;
can't expect much out of Barney and Cora,&#xD;
there--but they'll have an appetite by-and-&#xD;
bye. J can remember when I used to go hun-&#xD;
gry ; it was when I went to see her mother at&#xD;
first. I was afraid Lucy would think me pig-&#xD;
gish, and I never ate a full meal at herFather's&#xD;
house. But I got over that soon after we&#xD;
were married-ha ! ha!   Lucy was a fine&#xD;
girl-a noble woman ; knew to a turn how to&#xD;
roast beef, and could serve up a salmon fit for&#xD;
a prince. A fine girl was my Lucy. Cora is&#xD;
just as she used to be." And the old Alder-&#xD;
man heaved a deep sigh at the remembrance.&#xD;
"Is there any news of the proposed move-&#xD;
ment which it is riot wrong to impart to a&#xD;
prisoner, Captain Hurlbut ?" asked Barney.&#xD;
"There is news, my dear sir, which, con-&#xD;
sidering your present position, must be anyy&#xD;
thing but pleasant. The army will move to-&#xD;
morrow or next day-as soon as the vessels&#xD;
and transports have gone down the river. I&#xD;
presume, from what I heard at headquarters,&#xD;
that you and some few other prisoner's whom&#xD;
we have will be sent around to New York in a&#xD;
transport, under convoy, there to remain until&#xD;
you are exchanged, which last I most cordial-&#xD;
ly wish would soon happe, though I hope&#xD;
we may never meet except as friends."&#xD;
"I hope we may not, although if we do, I&#xD;
beg you, spare not a blow in memory that we&#xD;
have met before."&#xD;

SHE MAN-O'-WAR'8-MAN S GRUDGE.&#xD;
^CHAPTEIPT.&#xD;
AT SEA IN A TPEMP3SaT.-&#xD;
&#xD;
The report-this time wan true in regard to&#xD;
the evacuation of the city, although the British&#xD;
gdnaeal had materially altered his plane. Tatie&#xD;
was necessary for two reasons. As the season&#xD;
advanced, Washington's forces, weakened by&#xD;
the severe and inclement weather, now began&#xD;
to recruit and strengthen, and it was pretty&#xD;
certainly known that a heavy French squadron&#xD;
was off the coast. His route now was laid&#xD;
across New Jersey, over the eventful field of&#xD;
Monmouth, where, on the twenty-eighth of&#xD;
June, though not literally defeated, he was so&#xD;
severely punished tha' he was glad to draw off&#xD;
under cover of the night, and effect a rapid re-&#xD;
treat, whine Washington and his forces slept&#xD;
upon the battle field. But any of you can&#xD;
read history-I'll.corn back to my story.&#xD;
On the next morning after the dinner des-&#xD;
cribed in the preceding chapter, Barney, with&#xD;
his own men and ten or twelve other pris-&#xD;
oners, was tran'erred from the frigate to the&#xD;
armed transport schooner Cricket. The offi-&#xD;
cers of the Arethusa, who had even in that&#xD;
time become attached to him, parted with him&#xD;
with regret. He was so youthful, so sincere,&#xD;
yet so unostentatious in his patriotism, and his&#xD;
courage was so well known, that men 'f cbiv-&#xD;
airy and honor could not avoid liking him.&#xD;
Morley, his captor and friend, became espe-&#xD;
cially attached to him. But the parting words&#xD;
were said, and the transfer was made.&#xD;
Barney, on looking around him when he got&#xD;
on board the Cricket, found that his comfort&#xD;
was not increased, either in accommodations&#xD;
or society, by his transfer from the Arethusa.{&#xD;
The Cricket, though built fora fast sailor, was&#xD;
quite overloaded. In addition to her fault crew&#xD;
of tweaty men, she had a guard of twenty-five&#xD;
marines on board to take care of the prisoners.&#xD;
Her cabin accommodations were very poor,&#xD;
She was commanded by a bull-headed, rum-&#xD;
bloated man named Seraggs, who had been&#xD;
turned out of the regular service, after he had&#xD;
attained a lieutenancy, for drunkenness and&#xD;
quarrelsome habits. As might be supposed,&#xD;
tie was as near a brute as any two-legged talk-&#xD;
ing animal could be. He was endurable only&#xD;
when about half drunk, and it was seldom he&#xD;
wa' so near sober as that.&#xD;
His first officer, Mr. Marge, tried to imitate&#xD;
his superior, as far as he could-te did so in&#xD;
drunkenness and tyranny, butlacked the cour.&#xD;
?g of   oraggs.  The other mate. Mr. Nims,&#xD;
was a meek and hum le individual, who did&#xD;
iot grumble at any extra duty put upon him&#xD;
&#xD;
by the others, and who, to their infinite die-&#xD;
gust, always put water in his grog. He was&#xD;
a very good navigator, and eaved the other&#xD;
two the trouble of keeping the vessel's reek-&#xD;
oning. He was a very useful officer on board;&#xD;
especially because both his superiors were&#xD;
often too drunk to do duty. He never got&#xD;
"over the bay," spiritually speaking.&#xD;
The other occupant of the cabin, beside&#xD;
Barney, was Lieutenant Sponge, of the Royal&#xD;
Marines, who had especial charge of the ma-&#xD;
rines. He was a "sea sojer" and nothing else.&#xD;
If you want to know what one of them is, go&#xD;
ask the first man-o-war's-man that you meet.&#xD;
All these officers were on deck when Bar-&#xD;
ney was brought alongside in the Arethusa's&#xD;
boat. When he stepped on deck, acconpan-&#xD;
ied by Morley, Barney at a glance took in&#xD;
their respective characters. Morley at once&#xD;
proceeded to-introduee Barney to Scraggs and&#xD;
his officers, anA closed by hepinsr that they&#xD;
would make his time as agreeable as they&#xD;
could, for though a prisoner and an enemy,&#xD;
they would find him very agreeable company,&#xD;
and a gentleman.&#xD;
"Gentleman or no gentleman, he's got to&#xD;
rough it as wc do aboard the.Cricket I'' growl-&#xD;
ed Seraggs.&#xD;
"And we do rough itl" added Maggs. "No&#xD;
grub except rusty pork and horse beef--no&#xD;
lush except weak rum!"&#xD;
"Bad cheese and no porter !" added Lieut.&#xD;
Sponge.   "What are those things coming&#xD;
aboard from your boat, Mr. Morley ?"&#xD;
" Some wine, brandy, and other stores for&#xD;
Lieut Barney," said tie officer.&#xD;
" Oh,-we'll find plenty of roonito stow them.&#xD;
in the cabin!" said the lieutenant, eyeing the&#xD;
various articles as if he considered them al-&#xD;
ready his own property.&#xD;
"Aye, and in our read basketsI" growled&#xD;
Seraggs.  "I suppose it'll be mess property&#xD;
if the Yankee officer messes with us I'&#xD;
"Certainly," said Barney, determined to&#xD;
keep on friendly terms with all -parties, if he&#xD;
'could.&#xD;
Morley now took a very affectionate leave&#xD;
of Barney, and shoved off, the other prisoners&#xD;
being on board, and a general signal up for all&#xD;
the vessels to weigh and stand down the river.&#xD;
"That Leftenant is confounded sweet on&#xD;
you, seem' that he's a king's officer, and you're&#xD;
a rebel 1" growled Scragga to Barney, after&#xD;
the Arethusa's boat had gone.&#xD;

rue2mil pair of pistols, and a k'en-bladed&#xD;
Oagrr which he had provided himself with&#xD;
beforee he entered into the service of Riey.&#xD;
The weapons being small, were easily conceal-&#xD;
ed, Tuey were, however, large enough to be&#xD;
&#xD;
used with deadly effect, at close qu tr rs.&#xD;
Each of the men who had been with iin o&#xD;

ded; and, although he had not been a le to&#xD;

he might succeed in catching them at a disad-&#xD;
vantage. But sailing in company with other&#xD;
vessels, under convoy which would notice in&#xD;
an instant any change in her course, or dis-&#xD;
turbance on board, the thought seemed akin&#xD;
to madness   Yet there are some men who&#xD;
thrive best on difficulties, and who, though&#xD;
they often fail in ordinary matters, always suc-&#xD;
cceed in things which look impossible.&#xD;
The vessels made good headway down the&#xD;
river, and the day passed very agreeably, for&#xD;
Barney was free with his stores, of which he for-&#xD;
tunately had a good stock, and even Scragga,&#xD;
brutal as he was, treated the "d-d Yansee"&#xD;
with a great deal of kindness, in his way. So&#xD;
did Sponge.   After getting so tight that he&#xD;
could hardly stand straight, he turned out his&#xD;
guard on the quarter-deck, and put them&#xD;
through the manual, just to please Barney,&#xD;
whom he declared to be a tip-top fellow. He&#xD;
said he would have made afirst-rate royal ma-&#xD;
rine, and regretted that he was a rebel.&#xD;
It was night before the vessels cleared the&#xD;
bay.   As tney sighted the open sea between&#xD;
Henlopen and Cape May, they saw not that&#xD;
which they had rather feared, a blockading&#xD;
French squadron. But in a low blue bark of&#xD;
clouds that lay in the northeast, they saw the&#xD;
certainty of a head wind, and a very strong&#xD;
prospect that it would be anything but one of&#xD;
those "gentle zephyrs" which love-sick lads&#xD;
and lasses talk about.&#xD;
In preparation for this, many of the vessels&#xD;
began to shorten sail, send down ligh spars,&#xD;
etc. Perhaps this might have been done on&#xD;
board the Cricket, had not the secondti mate,&#xD;
Nims, suggested it  When he did so, Scraggs&#xD;
d-d him for a white-livered milk sop, and swore&#xD;
that if the Cricket couldn't carry her spars,&#xD;
she should drag them.&#xD;
Barney watched the weather with a great&#xD;
deal of interest. In case of a heavy gale, the&#xD;
Cricket right get separated from the rest of&#xD;
the fleet, and that would add to his chances.&#xD;
Sponge. as long as he had plenty to eat and&#xD;
drink, didn't care whether a gale came on or&#xD;
not--he had no watch to keep-nothing to do&#xD;
with the working of the vessel.&#xD;
By midnight the fleet was fairly at sea close'&#xD;
haued on a wind, and, according to order,&#xD;
pretty well together, as could be seen by the&#xD;
lights here and there seen rising and falling on&#xD;
the heaving waters. The gale had risen rapid-&#xD;
ly. and seemed to increase every hour.  The&#xD;
square sails of the Cricket had been taken in,&#xD;

THE MAN-O'-WAR S-MAN'S GRUDGE&#xD;
&#xD;
although Scraggs held on to them until she&#xD;
almost buried herself in the head sea which&#xD;
pitched in from the northeast. She was now&#xD;
under her main sail, foresail and jib, and these,&#xD;
without a reef, were evidently too much for&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" Hadn't I better take in a single reef, sir ?"&#xD;
said Nimns to Scraggs, in a very humble man-&#xD;
ner.&#xD;
"Go to hell, you water-drinking lubber,&#xD;
with your reefs.  Why, it don't blow hard&#xD;
enough to take the fleas off from a Jamaica&#xD;
niggers hide!' shouted Seragga. "Carry on&#xD;
her till I tell you to take in a reef!"&#xD;
"It is going to be rather a rough night,&#xD;
captain," said Barney ; "suppose we take a&#xD;
little more of that brandy t"&#xD;
"It is a going' to blow a good whole sail&#xD;
breeze, I s'pect-brandy won't hurt none to-&#xD;
night !" said Scraggs, softening down.&#xD;
"Won't you join us, Lieutenant Sponge ?"&#xD;
asked Barney.&#xD;
"I don't know but that I might with pro-&#xD;
priety,'' replied Sponge; "it is seldoni that I&#xD;
drink at night, but if I do, it is generally about&#xD;
this time."&#xD;
If it should come on to blow harder, and&#xD;
you should need the services of any of my&#xD;
men, Captain Scraggs, I am sure they could&#xD;
be depended upon," said Barney.&#xD;
"Aye-may be so-butI've got men enough&#xD;
of my own ; d-d lazy beef-eating lubbers.&#xD;
It takes me and Magge to knock the work out&#xD;
of 'em.  Nims isn't of any account.  I never&#xD;
knew a man 4tat watered his grog that was."&#xD;
"Mr. Maggs, were going below to freshen&#xD;
the nip, won't you join us ?" asked Barney, of&#xD;
the last mentioned officer, who, with a pipe in&#xD;
his mouth, was walking the deck.&#xD;
"Don't care if I do," said Maggs, with a&#xD;
pleasant growl, looking as kind as a big bull-&#xD;
dog when you heave him a piece of meat.&#xD;
"I'm like old Sponge there-I don't drink&#xD;
often-that is, never except when I'm dry-and&#xD;
if I do, it is'generally about this time !"&#xD;
"Oh, you needn't be laughing at me, Maggs,&#xD;
I haven't taken more than twenty nips to-day,&#xD;
and I swear you're at least about half a dozen&#xD;
a head of me !"&#xD;
"Bless yoa, I ought to be-I've got more&#xD;
stowage room below !" said Maggs, bringing&#xD;
his huge paw down upon his abdomen with a&#xD;
slap, as if to shake do on the contents and&#xD;
make more room.&#xD;
The party now went below, and Nims walk.&#xD;
ed the deck alone.  Being alone he indulged&#xD;
in a soliloquy. And it ran thus:&#xD;
"Swig-swig!     There they go!  There's&#xD;
nothing' ever softens Scraggs ormellows Maggs,&#xD;
but rum. As water is to oil, so is rum to&#xD;
them.   I oughtn't to grumble when they&#xD;
drink-it makes the times easier for me.&#xD;
While they're drinking' they aren't growlin'--&#xD;
while they're pitehin' into the liquor they&#xD;
forget to pitch into me. I wonder if ever I'll&#xD;
&#xD;
get aboard of a better craft than this. The&#xD;
craft is good enough-but Scragga is the devil,&#xD;
and Maggs is his mate. I've Hearn tell that&#xD;
there is a difference betwixt hell and purga-&#xD;
tory. I guess the last craft I was in was pur-&#xD;
gatory, for it was a little easier there than&#xD;
here. Thunder how it blows. I'll wager a&#xD;
pound of tobacco agin a quart o' rum, that&#xD;
that foresail goes out of the bolt ropes afore&#xD;
long."&#xD;
At that moment, rip-rip went the sail,&#xD;
tearing into ribbons in a moment.&#xD;
"Tobaceojwins !" said Nims, coolly, as he&#xD;
put his head down the companion way of the&#xD;
cabin, and shouted-&#xD;
"The foresail's blown away, Cap'n Scragge!"&#xD;
"Let it go and be d-d !" growled Scraggs,&#xD;
in a deep basso from below. "It's a pity you&#xD;
didn't go with it !" added Maggs.&#xD;
"If I had, there'd be more work for you!"&#xD;
growled Nims, as he turned and admired the&#xD;
ripping propensities of the gale, as it finished&#xD;
up the foresail. "It saves work a reefin, or&#xD;
a gettin' of it!"&#xD;
The vessel was much relieved by the loss of&#xD;
the foresail.' and made better weather of it&#xD;
now, although she still had more canvas&#xD;
than she ought to carry under the circum-&#xD;
stance. But she was so deeply laden that she&#xD;
did not heel to the wend as she would had she&#xD;
been lighter, and "therefore seemed more able&#xD;
to bear it.&#xD;
For hour after hour, even after the watch&#xD;
was changed, Nims paced the deck, stopping&#xD;
occasionally to listen to the sounds of song&#xD;
and shout and laughter that came up from&#xD;
below, tokening the manner in which the oc-&#xD;
cupants of the cabin were enjoying them-&#xD;
selves.&#xD;
"I'm a thinkin'," muttered Nims, ' that that&#xD;
Yankee officer thinks he is keen, and can&#xD;
drink them fellows drunk.  Wiy, he might&#xD;
just as well try to fill a leaky cask, as to get&#xD;
enough into Maggs or Seraugs.   And as to&#xD;
the sojer-he soaks it in just like any other&#xD;
Sponge!"&#xD;
At last, however, the songs and laughter&#xD;
grew more faint, and finally only an occa-&#xD;
sional word came to his ear, and then it was&#xD;
sure to ne aeeompaned by the clink of glasses.&#xD;
It was nearly morning, and Nims began to&#xD;
feel so weary that he thought of running the&#xD;
risk of a cursing from Maggs, by asking him&#xD;
to come on deck and relieve him, when, to his&#xD;
utter astonishment, Barney came up from the&#xD;
cabin, in a perfectly sober state,&#xD;
"It is blowing very fresh, Mr. Nims," said&#xD;
the latter, glancing to windward.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, blown' great guns-it carried our&#xD;
foresail clean out of the bolt ropes--didn't&#xD;
have a yard of canvas to swear by. Isn't&#xD;
-Mr. Maggs coming on deck soon, sir ?"&#xD;
"I hardly think he will. I left him and&#xD;
Captain Scraggs hugging each other very lov-&#xD;
ingly under the tale."&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MAN-O'-WAR S-MAN'S GRUDGE&#xD;
&#xD;
I remember once when I was in Charleston,&#xD;
S. C., hearing a French gentleman" all of the&#xD;
olden school," telling another where he had&#xD;
passed the evening before. Said he :&#xD;
"I was wiz one varee select companie. Zere&#xD;
was Shack Miller, and Shon Shenkins and&#xD;
Monsieur Delaplan and myself-Von varee se-&#xD;
lect companie I"&#xD;
The City Marshal, who was taking. a smil&#xD;
with me at the French coffee-house on "the&#xD;
bay," remarked, sotto voce, "Four more accom-&#xD;
plished villians couldn't be raked up in the&#xD;
city."&#xD;
So, on the same principle, "a very select&#xD;
company" was assembled in the back room of&#xD;
Tom Riley's groggery, on the second night&#xD;
after the city had been evacuatedby the Brit-&#xD;
ish. Although it was scarcely yet midnight,&#xD;
the front door, which was usually kept open&#xD;
nearly all night, was carefully closed, as were&#xD;
also the window blinds.&#xD;
A large table was set in the room, and upon&#xD;
it stood several bottles and glasses-and over&#xD;
it also were strewed a variety of weapons.&#xD;
There was the deadly and dastardly slung'shot&#xD;
-the keen double edged Spanish dagger-the&#xD;
three-cornered Italian stiletto-the heavy and&#xD;
dangerous looking English sheath knife. Pis-&#xD;
tols, too, of various kinds and sizes,were there.&#xD;
And a rough, lawless looking set of despera-&#xD;
does were the owners of these weapons Elli-&#xD;
ott, still disguised, was there, a scowl of fiend&#xD;
ish hate resting on his face. Tom Riley pre-&#xD;
sided at the head of the table. "One-Sided&#xD;
Jack" acted as steward, while the rest of the&#xD;
company, seven in number, looked as if they&#xD;
had been sent up from below, by the devil, to&#xD;
perform some foul deed at his especial bidding.&#xD;
They appeared to have come from all quarters&#xD;
of the globe. One was a huge, repulsive loo t-&#xD;
ong negro. A cut, reaching from his temple&#xD;
clear down to his chin, had laid the flesh open,&#xD;
and left a broad white scar. His great eyes&#xD;
looked red, as if they were stained with blood,&#xD;
and when he opened his mouth it looked more&#xD;
like that of some carniverous animal than that&#xD;
of a human being. His hair was grizzled, and&#xD;
he boasted of being one of those fiendish&#xD;
wretebes who, in a recent revolt in the West&#xD;
India Islands, had butchered a large, number&#xD;
of women, after perpetrating the most horrid&#xD;
enoraities, having first slain their defenders.&#xD;
He was one of Lhe few wh.' hid escaped the&#xD;
tearful fate-of the others who had been burned&#xD;
ahve--he having, after being wounded, fled to&#xD;
the muntaiius, where he remain'-d until he had&#xD;
an opportunity of joining a.pira-ieal vessel,&#xD;
&#xD;
which ran into an unfrequented cove in search&#xD;
of fresh water.&#xD;
At the time which I take of introducing this&#xD;
very setect company to the reader, this fero-&#xD;
cious monster was relating, with the greatest&#xD;
gusto, the 'fearful deeds in which he had par-&#xD;
ioipated. And lhe charter of his auditors&#xD;
may best be judged, when it is stated that they&#xD;
listened with gusto to his horrid details, ap-&#xD;
plauding as he described the struggles of beau-&#xD;
tiful, despairing maidens in the power of&#xD;
wretches like himself. Oh, God, how depraved&#xD;
and heartless man can be ! Often I sicken in&#xD;
describing his depravity, and yet never do I&#xD;
overstep that which I know to have been.&#xD;
"Fill up-fill up, hearties ! It'll soon be&#xD;
time for us to be on the move !" cried Riley.&#xD;
"Yes," said Elliott, draining a glass filled&#xD;
to the brim with brandy, "and remember, boys,&#xD;
a rich prize is before you-the old man has&#xD;
lots of gold stowed away, and a large service&#xD;
of silver plate !"&#xD;
"I envy you 'the prize the most, oap'n !"&#xD;
said the hideous negro; "that is, if she's as&#xD;
han'some as you say she is !"&#xD;
"Pretty ? There isn't a handsomer girl on&#xD;
the continent-such a form, full and voluptu-&#xD;
ous as that of Cleopatra-eyes large and I -&#xD;
trous as those of a gazelle-lips like  aw-&#xD;
berries bursting with ripeness-a skin softer&#xD;
and fairer than the leaf of a fresh blown lily I"&#xD;
Oti, how the red eyes of the coarse negro'&#xD;
gloated as he listened to Elliott's impassioned&#xD;
description.&#xD;
" You'll remember your promise,cap'n!" he&#xD;
said : " you'll remember your promise about&#xD;
her!"&#xD;
"Yes-yes-it will',just satisfy my revenge&#xD;
after I've spurned her a ruined, debased crea-&#xD;
ture from my feet. Yes, Domingo; you, you&#xD;
shall ha e her;, and I only wish that her lover&#xD;
could be chained down within eight of you, as&#xD;
you clasp her, shrieking, to' your arms !"&#xD;
"Fill up once more. and we'll be off !"&#xD;
shouted Riley. "Here's to our noble cap'n !"&#xD;
"Here's to the captain--here's, to the-eap-&#xD;
tam!" cried all the rest.&#xD;
Elliott arose and thanked them.&#xD;
"Men!" said he, 'you have chosen me for&#xD;
a leader, and you will fled . in me one who&#xD;
never will flinch in any daring or damnable&#xD;
work. It was not the want of money atat&#xD;
made me seek you out and jon your band. I&#xD;

There is plenty of gold and plate in the house&#xD;
which we enter to-night. Of that I shall not&#xD;
touch a single ounce for my own use !"&#xD;
"Bravo, captain I" Hurrah for our noble&#xD;
captain !"&#xD;
"No,.I seek, as I said, revenge I" All I want&#xD;
is the girl, and her I'll have, or die in the trial.&#xD;
You have sworn to obey me--to follow my&#xD;
leading 1"&#xD;
"Yes, to hell's gates, if you'll take us&#xD;
there 1" shouted the negro.&#xD;
"I trust to you all. This night is but the&#xD;
commencement of our work-after my hand&#xD;
is once in, you'll see that, like the lion which&#xD;
has once tasted human blood, there will be no&#xD;
stay to my appetite. You shall revel ingold 1"&#xD;
And beauty !" added the hideous black.&#xD;
"And rum and tobacco shall be as plenty&#xD;
as water in the river and chips in a ship-yard!"&#xD;
added Riley.&#xD;
"Now, my lads, I've said my say, arm and&#xD;
we'll start,'' said Elliott, concluding, and swal-&#xD;
lowing another glass of brandy.&#xD;
Each one now assumed his weapons and ar-&#xD;
ranged his disguise, and then Elliott imparted&#xD;
his plan.&#xD;
"I've secured one of the servants, by a&#xD;
heavy bribe," he said, and the door will be&#xD;
open to us. You know, Tom Riley, where the&#xD;
old man sleeps. You take two of the men and&#xD;
&#xD;
fix him. The strong chest is in his room. Do-&#xD;
mingo and myself will get the girl. The other&#xD;
four will stay and guard the door, and be&#xD;
ready to cover our retreat. You'll remain&#xD;
here, One-Sided Jack, ready to let us in with&#xD;
plunder, and be sure to have the door of the&#xD;
cellar vault open so that I can get the girl in&#xD;
quickly if we are followed."&#xD;
"All right, eap'n I I'll be on hand," said&#xD;
the cripple.&#xD;
"Do you all fully understand my plan ?"&#xD;
asked Elliott.&#xD;
"All-all!" was the reply.&#xD;
"Then follow me, but go still and keep scat-&#xD;
tering till we reach the house. And remember&#xD;
if there is any resistance, use steel; don't fire&#xD;
a pistol to alarm the neighborhood, if you&#xD;
can help it."&#xD;
The party now gathered in the outer room,&#xD;
and, let out by the cripple, departed one by&#xD;
one, from the door. After the last one had&#xD;
gone, " One-Sided Jack" closed the door.&#xD;
Then, from close under the eaves of tb'&#xD;
house, where the shadow was dense, two per-&#xD;
sons glided noiselessly out, and followed in the&#xD;
rear of the gang of desperadoes.&#xD;
The night was dark, for there was no moon,&#xD;
and a strong south-easterly breeze swept a dark&#xD;
and heavy mass of clouds in from sea-ward.&#xD;

sound from dear lips, when you know that, Un-&#xD;
like the sad farewell, it only meansau revoir&#xD;
for a little time. When you expect, your self&#xD;
refreshed by 'rialmy sleep, nature's sweet re-&#xD;

Never did Cora look more beautiful than&#xD;
when she bent her lovely head to kiss her dear&#xD;
father's brow, before she retired for the night.&#xD;
11cr dark tresce, shining like the glossy down&#xD;
from a raven's breast, mingled with his white&#xD;
hairs, and her red lips touched his forehead,&#xD;
like a red rose bowing on its stem to kiss a lily.&#xD;
4         And her voice was full of melody as she ten-&#xD;
derly said .&#xD;
-Good night, my dear father."&#xD;
"God bless thee, Cora, my darling," was his&#xD;
response, as be pressed her light and grace-&#xD;
ful form to his bosom. "May the good angels&#xD;

Then, accompanied by Eliza, she retired to&#xD;
her chamber.&#xD;
"I do not feel sleepy, yet it is time that I&#xD;
b        retired," she said to Eliza, as she seated her-&#xD;
self in the room.&#xD;
I wonder where the poor lieutenant is&#xD;
now ?" said Eliza. "Oh, how I did hate to see&#xD;
him go."&#xD;
"He is probably on the ocean now. And&#xD;
the wind blows fearfully. Yet why should I&#xD;
fear that the elements would harm him, when&#xD;
man is more cruel ?"&#xD;
'There's one comfort, Miss Co, a."&#xD;
" What's that. Eliza." asked the mistress.&#xD;
" He isn't alone in his trouble's ma'am. Jim&#xD;
Thompson, bless his noble heart, told me the&#xD;

fellow, he too is a prisoner, and cannot help&#xD;
himself. We must have patience-they will&#xD;
be released some time."&#xD;
"Patience, Miss Cora! I thin we've been&#xD;
tried hard enough.  It needed more patience&#xD;
than ever Job had to get along when those sol-&#xD;
diers were in the house. Patience is like good&#xD;
fortune, it isn't every one that is blessed with&#xD;
it, though, for my part, I believe I'm the most&#xD;
patientest crea'ure on this sublunary spear.&#xD;
You never see me get into tantrums, do you,&#xD;
Miss Cora?-not even when      he chimney&#xD;
smokes."&#xD;
"Not often,my good Eliza--you are a kind,&#xD;
even-tempered girl."&#xD;
"I thought you'd say that of me, Miss Cora.&#xD;
Shall I fix you for bed ?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you like, Eliza, although I do not&#xD;
feel sleepy."&#xD;
"How sweet you do look, Miss Cora," said&#xD;
Eliza, after she had finishedthe night toilet of&#xD;
her beautiful mistress. Then she kissed her&#xD;
lily hand, and, bidding her good night, departed&#xD;
to her own room.&#xD;
And Cora knelt down to pray. How beau-&#xD;
tiful is prayer ! The kneeling of those who,&#xD;
though weak, and frail, and mortal, are made&#xD;
in His.image who is immortal. The looking&#xD;
up from this earth, which, with all its beauties,&#xD;
is still dark and sin laden, to the bright spirit&#xD;
land where angels sing His praises for ever-&#xD;
more ; looking up and feelieg that great above&#xD;
all greatness, powerful above ail power,.bright&#xD;
above all brightness, and good above all good-&#xD;
ness, though tie e, yet le bends His benign&#xD;
ear to the petitions of the humblest being who&#xD;
kneels upon His footstool.&#xD;
And Cora knelt in her white robes to pray&#xD;
for herself and for those whom she loved. Like&#xD;
a low gush of melody rolling on the breeze of&#xD;
even from off the strings of an reolian harp did&#xD;
her sweet whisperings fill that room.&#xD;
Who beta fiend from hell itself could regard&#xD;
her, in her spiritual beauty, in her parity, save&#xD;
with hallowed thoughts, thoughts as near akin&#xD;
to adoration as may be given to anything that&#xD;
is earthly.&#xD;
She has closed bher prayer-she rises-she&#xD;
approaches her couch--she turns down the&#xD;
snowy coverlets Hark ! She hears a footstep&#xD;
-a stealthy one.. Her door opens-she turns&#xD;
and beholds--Elliott, and a huge and hideous&#xD;
negro!&#xD;

For a moment the vessel shot ahead right in  "The boat is all ready," said Barney, a few&#xD;

she began to drop astern.                  "Shall we carry arms ?" asked Nims.&#xD;

&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
Nims heaved a deep sigh, and repeated the&#xD;
following verses :&#xD;
"There was a flower, the fairest one&#xD;
That evermet my eye-&#xD;
There was a stir, which seemed alone&#xD;
To gem for me the sky-&#xD;
There was a hope, to which I clung&#xD;
Most fond and fervently-&#xD;
There was aname, which on my tongue&#xD;
Alone was melody.&#xD;
"But ah ! that flower now is worn&#xD;
Upon another's breast-&#xD;
The hope is from my bosomtorn,&#xD;
Which once that bosom blessed-&#xD;
The star which once above me shone&#xD;
Now lights my path no more-&#xD;
I dare not cherish as my own&#xD;
The name I did of yore.&#xD;
"Vet in the morning, and at eve,&#xD;
The star-the flower-the name--&#xD;
And hope arecherished-which I grieve.&#xD;
Are present like the Slame&#xD;
, Which on the holy altar burns,&#xD;
Forever, night and day ;&#xD;
And as to it the Christian turns,&#xD;
So I to them, and pray.&#xD;
"Pray that the flower may never fade--&#xD;
The star may never set-&#xD;
N cloud the floweret ever shade,&#xD;
No tear its bright cheek wet;&#xD;
And though I may slot breathe the name,&#xD;
And hope's bright dream is er.&#xD;
A place ini memory 'twill claim&#xD;
Until I breathe no more,&#xD;
They had now almost arrived at the house,&#xD;
when a shriek-a wild, shrill shriek, that&#xD;
pierced their very hearts-came ringing'on the&#xD;
air.&#xD;
"My God, 'tis from her'ihanber ! Draw,&#xD;
Nims, if you are a man, and follow        me"&#xD;
shouted Barney, as he bounded forward. The&#xD;
door of the house was open, and armed men&#xD;
were there, as Barney sprung to ward it, but&#xD;
they were already engaged. Two shots were&#xD;
fired as Barney rushed up the steps, and he&#xD;
saw a sword flashing in the hands of one who&#xD;
sought to enter. In a moment that one would&#xD;
have fallen by his hand, but by the'fashof a&#xD;
pistol he recognised Caroline Ormsley,. even&#xD;
though she was in male attire.&#xD;
"You here, Miss Ormsley 1" he exclaimed,&#xD;
as he drove his sword through the man who&#xD;
opposed her.&#xD;
"On, Barney! on, and save her you love !&#xD;
Elliott is up stairs I" she cried, as she fell back,&#xD;
wounded, into the arms of Nims, who was&#xD;
close behind him.&#xD;
Shriek after shriek reached Barney-s ago-&#xD;
nized ear. . Pushing aside with his naked left&#xD;
arm a murderous blow which was aimed at&#xD;
his heart, he clove another opposer down, and&#xD;
rushed up the stairs.&#xD;
Wild was his shout as hd sprang through&#xD;
the open door of Cora's chamber, and saw the&#xD;
poor, girl, with torn dress and dishevelled 'hair,&#xD;
madly struggling in the arms of Elliott and&#xD;
the fiendish negro, who were striving to bind&#xD;
and gag her.&#xD;
The negro turned as he heard that shout,&#xD;
and his red eyes glared like balls of fire as he&#xD;
drew   his knife and rushed toward Barney.&#xD;
But he had looked his last look' A ball from&#xD;
Barney's pistol crashed through his'brain, and&#xD;
&#xD;
with a fearful howl he sank at Barney's feet&#xD;
ere he could reach him.&#xD;
Elliott dropped his intended victim, and,&#xD;
drawing his sword, sprang witiafrenzied yell&#xD;
of hate to ward Barney. The latter, eager to&#xD;
meet him, rushed forward ; but the negro,&#xD;
in his dying agony, caught him by the&#xD;
foot, and he fell headlong to the floor. At that&#xD;
instant the report of a blunderbuss below fair-&#xD;
ly shook the house ; but it did not drown the&#xD;
yell of triumph which rose from Elliott's lips&#xD;
as he raised his sword to strike a death-blow&#xD;
home to the heart of his defenseless foe.&#xD;
But a flash, a ringing shot, and his upraised&#xD;
arm fell powerless at his side.&#xD;
"That shot.was mine, Henry Elliott-mine&#xD;
mine! I am revenged !" shrieked Caroline&#xD;
Ormsley, as she staggered forward and fell&#xD;
down at his feet. With glaring eyes he look-&#xD;
ed at her one instant, then pressed his hand&#xD;
to his heart, through which the ball had pass-&#xD;
ed, and fell dead at her side, without uttering a&#xD;
word. Her life-blood was mingling with his.&#xD;
In an instant Barney was on his feet ; the&#xD;
next moment he was by the side of Cora, and&#xD;
-had raised her in his arms.&#xD;
"Saved-:saved-thankGod !" she murmur-&#xD;
ed, and fainted in his arms.&#xD;
"Mc' daughter-my daughter-where is&#xD;
Cora?' shouted the Alderman, rushinglinto the&#xD;
room in his night-clothes, carrying in his hand&#xD;
by the barrel a blunderbuss, the shattered and&#xD;
bloody butt of which told that he had not&#xD;
been idle.&#xD;
"She is safe. Are you hurt, sir?" cried&#xD;
Barney ; "you are bleeding"&#xD;
"Only a scratch, my boy. There were two&#xD;
of 'em, but I did 'em both-d----u 'em, I did&#xD;
'em both-the Lord forgive me for s wearing.&#xD;
How in Heaven's name did you get here in&#xD;
this very nick of time? Why, that's Elliott on&#xD;
'the floor-dead, eh ?-saved the hangman a&#xD;
job. And a big nigger-bah I And a young lad&#xD;
--a handsome one ; what could have brought&#xD;
him here? All dead 1"&#xD;
"Father, are you safe ?" asked Cora, faintly,&#xD;
recovering partially.&#xD;
-  Yes, my chick; and Barney's safe, and&#xD;
you're safe, "and I don't care if all the rest of&#xD;
the world is dead-d-----d if I do ! Good&#xD;
Lord, forgive me for swearing, but I'm so&#xD;
happy !"&#xD;
The old Alderman now embraced both Bar-&#xD;
ney and his daughter, at one moment laugh-&#xD;
ing and the next crying.&#xD;
Barney disengaged himself, for he now be-&#xD;
thought himself of Nims ; but at that moment&#xD;
he entered, his sword red with blood, and a&#xD;
bad gash in his cheek.&#xD;
"They're are all gone, or down, sir," he said.&#xD;
I "One got away, but I couldn't help it-I&#xD;
marked him"&#xD;
"Bravo. Nims ! hereafter you are a brother&#xD;
to me," cried Barney.&#xD;

At this moment the poor crippled negro    looked down into her pale face. He said no&#xD;
Cato crept into the room.                  word, hut great tears like melted pearls chased&#xD;
"Thank him-be fought like a devil I" said  each other down his sable face. At that in-&#xD;
Nims.                                      stant, pale and terrified into utter speechless-&#xD;
"Poor fellow," said Barney, "his mistress  ness, Eliza rushed into the room.&#xD;
is dead ; her last act was to save my life."  Reader, the tableau for this chapter is per&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIV'&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a few days later. In that house&#xD;
wherein such a fearful scene of bloodshed os-&#xD;
curred as was described in the last chayter, a&#xD;
joyous party was assembled, composed en-&#xD;
tirely of those with whom the readers have&#xD;
already become familiar, and for whom, I&#xD;
hope, they have nourished some friendly feel-&#xD;
ing.   ..                     e&#xD;
It was in thelarge old dining hail that the&#xD;
party was assembled, and it consisted of the&#xD;
old Alderman, Barney and his, betrothed,&#xD;
Nims, in a new American uniform, Eliza, the&#xD;
faithful maid of Cora, and last, but not least,&#xD;
honest, brave, faithful Jim Thompson.&#xD;
The Aldermanwas in his glory. Seated in&#xD;
his favorite arm-chair, he held a brimming&#xD;
goblet in his hand, and drank "Joy, happi-&#xD;
ness, to all around him.&#xD;
"Barney," he cred, "you deserve my&#xD;
Cora; take tier, God bless you, and make her&#xD;
agood buband, the has been anaffectionate,&#xD;
good daughter, and I know she'll make you a&#xD;
loving wife."&#xD;
"I am sure she will, and I will try to de-&#xD;
serve her !" said Barney, as he pressed her&#xD;
dear hand to his manly lips.&#xD;
"And, Thompson, I suppose you'll get&#xD;
spliced, as you sailors say, to Eliza there.&#xD;
Well, I-ll do the job for you for nothing."&#xD;
" I'd like that very well, your honor," 'said&#xD;
Thompson, looking at Eliza, who sat blushing&#xD;
like a peony-'I'd like it very well, for Miss&#xD;
Eliza is built like a clipper, and I've no doubt&#xD;
wo'ild sail like one over the sea of married&#xD;
life ; but I've got neven little reasons, and one&#xD;
big one, why her and me can't be spliced."&#xD;
" What are they?" asked tae Alderman,&#xD;
while Eliza turned pale, and looked as if she&#xD;
was about to faint.&#xD;
"Why, your honor, if the truth must be&#xD;
told, I've got a fat wife and seven children&#xD;
now, and it wouldn't be exactly right for&#xD;
&#xD;
to take a nice al like Miss Eliza in tow afore&#xD;
t'other one had slipped her cable."&#xD;
Eliza looked as if she would indeed faint&#xD;
now, but Barney brought the blushes back to&#xD;
her cpeek, and perhaps hope to her heart once&#xD;
more, as he said:&#xD;
"There's my noble friend Nims in want of&#xD;
a wife, Eliza--you shall not go husbandless. I&#xD;
know that he has a good heart, and will make&#xD;
a first-rate husband."&#xD;
"I'd try to, if only to please you, my kind&#xD;
benefactor," said Nims ; "that is, if the lady&#xD;
has no objection."&#xD;
"I'm afraid Miss Cora can't spare me," said&#xD;
Eliza, smiling through her tears and blushes.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, in such a case, Eliza," said those&#xD;
joyous Cora, "and wish you many years of&#xD;
unalloyed happiness."&#xD;
Eliza thought at once that a single officer&#xD;
was a better match than a married seaman, and&#xD;
when Nims took hold of her hand, she did not&#xD;
withdraw it.&#xD;
A few days later still, and Jim Thompson,&#xD;
as a special friend and favorite, was allowed&#xD;
to dance at a double wedding.&#xD;
And now, reader, my tale is one. The&#xD;
name of Barney belongs to history ; it is a&#xD;
proud relic of his country. His after deeds&#xD;
upon the water, his heroic conduct at Bladens-&#xD;
burg are recorded in letters of glory which&#xD;
the hand of time, unsparing as it is, can never&#xD;
efface while the name of one hero of the Revo-&#xD;
lution is remembered. From his marriage&#xD;
with the fair daughter of Alderman Bedford,&#xD;
sprang some of the best stock which now ex-&#xD;
ists in this city and that of Baltimore. His&#xD;
honored name, borne by a descendant, still&#xD;
graces our naval register; and if the ancient&#xD;
grudge is again to be worked up between us&#xD;
and the old country, I doubt not but that the&#xD;
blood will be found as good as ever.&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
f&#xD;
.  U&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
A description of one scene, and I have fin-&#xD;
ished. It was the first day of December, 1818.&#xD;
Where the rapid Monongahela rushes impet-&#xD;
uously into the virgin embrace of the silvery&#xD;
Alleghany, and, united as 'two hearts in one,"&#xD;
they under the beautiful name of Ohio roll off&#xD;
toward the fathomless ocean, a Christian and&#xD;
a hero lay upon his death bed. The cold win-&#xD;
ter winds were sweeping over the rushing&#xD;
waters and snow-flakes filled the air ; but hot&#xD;
tears were gushing out from fond eyes upon&#xD;
his bosom, and kind words from dear lips were&#xD;
cheering up his spirit as it plumed its wbite&#xD;
wings for departure to a better world.&#xD;
"Cora-dear Cora," muttered the dying&#xD;
man. "you have been a blessed angel to me,&#xD;
through life ; weep not at my departure-you&#xD;
will soon follow me. Bring up our children&#xD;
in the path which I have trod ; tell themto be&#xD;
true to their country and their God. I've play-&#xD;
ed with death many a time, my love-have&#xD;
slipped out of his grasp very often; he has an&#xD;
old grudge against me, and mist take it out."&#xD;
He died, beloved by all who knew him-re-&#xD;
speeted even by his foes.&#xD;
Itmay appear vain in the author to append&#xD;
&#xD;
the following statement, but if so he cannot&#xD;
help it for it is one of the few occurrencessin&#xD;
his life that he is proud of.&#xD;
In 1844, just after retiring by voluntary re-&#xD;
signation from the navy, he started a literary&#xD;
magazine in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. On one&#xD;
occasion, during the spring of that year, while&#xD;
walking through the old graveyard of the&#xD;
---church of thatcity, he stumbled over a&#xD;
broken and sunken slab of marble, half cover-&#xD;
ed with the grass which had atready grown&#xD;
up rank above it. Upon looking at the in-&#xD;
scription on the stone, he found that it rested&#xD;
over the remains of Commodore Joshua Bar-&#xD;
ney. Instantly publishing a notice of the ne-&#xD;
glected state of the grave, and also writing a&#xD;
biography of the hero, he called public atten-&#xD;
tion to the matter, and did not rest until those&#xD;
revered remains were removed to the City&#xD;
Cemetery, and a monument worthy of the city&#xD;
of his burial placed over him.&#xD;
And now, dear readrs--you.who have had&#xD;
the patience to follow me through this long&#xD;
story-farewell. I hope, though I am an old&#xD;
man-o-war'si-ian,you will not hold any grudge&#xD;
against me.&#xD;
