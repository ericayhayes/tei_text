as .the door-bell ceased its second ringing.&#xD;
"Wait until she is graciously pleased to inform&#xD;
us," replied my .cousin Kate, who was at that moment&#xD;
engaged in tying her slipper, a performance  he never&#xD;
hurried, She hiad a'small foot, had Kate, but then she&#xD;
was under size herself.&#xD;
"No need, Emma," added Mary Allen, laughing.&#xD;
" Of course Kate is the chosen one ; who buGilber-t&#xD;
Stuart would have so little consideration lazy&#xD;
toilettes as to call before seven ?"&#xD;
"Nonsense!"' Kate ejaculated, blusW d   ty&#xD;

very well whose eyes lightened Gilbert Stuart's way&#xD;
to ii~jiincie 'I~oin's dear old home.&#xD;
Bessie, as fore~~ld by the wise Mary, announced&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"There, Kate! Now, Kate!" cried Emma, pre-&#xD;
ten&amp;amp;ing to help, but in reality greatly retarding Kate's&#xD;
effort~ to dress. "Bless. me! not that eternal silk.&#xD;
Why you'll melt the man!"&#xD;
"Kate has no objection, I suppose," said Mary,&#xD;
with more malice than one would expect from ~ girl&#xD;
with a "Vocation," for Mary was to be a nunshe&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"I do not see why you all tease me," Kate mut-&#xD;
tered, pretending to be vexed. "I am sure Mr. Stuart&#xD;
pays just as much attention to Georgie as to me: 'why&#xD;
don't you tease her?"&#xD;
"Georgie!" exclaimed the girls, in arch chorus,&#xD;
"who ever heard of such a thing!"&#xD;
*" Do x*nake them stop,". pleaded Kate, turning to&#xD;
me; but I said nothing. I was counting, by the beat-&#xD;
ings of my heart, the few seconds necessary for me to&#xD;
give to them, as proof of indifference to the Visitor be.&#xD;
low; and W Kate wanted to be such a fool as to fancy&#xD;
everyYg~entieman who came to see "the ladies" was&#xD;
especi~1y~4et~' ~dorer, let her think so~ ,she ~irould, per-&#xD;
haps, fiiid outythe difference some day.&#xD;
"I~4elleve, as I ~m dressed, I will go down," I&#xD;
I K&#xD;
said at Thst. '"Kate will need considerable time yet&#xD;
&#xD;
to make herself satisfactorily bewitching;" and. after&#xD;
leisurely lounging out of the room, I hew down the&#xD;
broad staircase, to meet him whose dear, dark eyes&#xD;
once looking into mine, had so flooded my soul with&#xD;
love and faith that I read, fearless in my own truth, in&#xD;
his ever after quiet gaze, in his calm words, in his low-&#xD;
toned voice, unfathomable depths ~f tenderness, turn-&#xD;
ing silently to me, as the broad river runs noiselessly&#xD;
to the ocean.&#xD;
Years have passed since then ; grief; anguish, blood,&#xD;
and death, ~~and between that day and this, and.&#xD;
still I see myself; in the spring-time of my youth, be-&#xD;
fore there had been a thorn 'or even a withered flower&#xD;
in my pathway, or a cloud in my sky-a blooming -&#xD;
girl, whose rosy cheeks and clear, dark eyes might&#xD;
for a moment dim the purer beauty of clear cut feat-&#xD;
ures, and broad, ftill brow: a creature of light, grace,&#xD;
and happiness, flitting past the frowning pictures,&#xD;
dancing down the dark polished stairs, with white&#xD;
jewelled hands gleaming along the grim carvings!&#xD;
Did angels fold their wings and weep, as she glided&#xD;
swiftly through their ranks, down to the little worl~1&#xD;
that was all the world to her-the 'world of Love?&#xD;
Gilbert awaited me just by the door, leaning, with&#xD;
the unconscious grace of-a strong man, against my&#xD;
piano, raising his head slowly, as I came nearer, and&#xD;
letting the light come up, not hastily, to hi~ dark, col-&#xD;
orless cheek, to greet me.~&#xD;

'~There was one song of which he never seemed to&#xD;
grow tired, a weird kind of thing, with a mystic bur-&#xD;
den of love triumphant only in death'; a song little in&#xD;
accordance with' his cool temperament, yet his favor-&#xD;
ite. I rarely waited for him to ask me to sing it, but&#xD;
gave it unasked; now, when after some conversation&#xD;
in the. twilight, h&amp;amp; requested it, some indefinable im-&#xD;
pulse made me answer:&#xD;
"Not until I know wherein lies its charmI"&#xD;
"Beware! Curiosity lost Eve her paradise."&#xD;
'~ Thus, too, may I. So be it," I returned, smiling,&#xD;
secure in my paradise, which could not banish me&#xD;
while h~, liVed. "Tell me, have your' two mysteries.&#xD;
any 'connection? Has ,my song any connection with&#xD;
the mysterious miniature you guard so faithfully?"&#xD;
For once I had seen him, in looking for a note~&#xD;
take from his pocket an oval velvet case, inside of&#xD;
* which I had vainly asked to look. Making the re&#xD;
mark, I looked fearlessly up to his quiet eyes, wonder-&#xD;
ing 'why the smiles should grow deeper, losing them-&#xD;
selves in sadness, as he continued~ to gaze upon me.&#xD;
".M~ist it be so?" he murmured, more of himself&#xD;
than of me' it seemed. And then, without removing&#xD;
from mine his eyes,'growing deeper and more tender&#xD;
still, taking one of my hands in his, he placed in the&#xD;
oI~her the velvet case-open.&#xD;
It eQnl4ined a girl's portrait. A fair, young face,&#xD;
fairer, fainter colored, lighter' lined than mine; a char-&#xD;
&#xD;
acterless face, with delicate features, and soft, emotion-&#xD;
less blue eyes; my cousin Kate's face, with only a&#xD;
shade of resemblance, a misty, shadowy, flitting resem-&#xD;
blance. My cousin Kate's face, but her face subdued,&#xD;
refined, poetized, idealized.&#xD;
She must love him,, or no painter could ever so&#xD;
have painted her.&#xD;
"Who is it?" I asked.&#xD;
"It is myftanc~e," he answered.&#xD;
Into my veins, even to the tips of the fingers rest'&#xD;
ing in his, ran the hit iron that was to harden in my&#xD;
soul. I smiled, said "How you surprise me!" thought&#xD;
the face "lovely," and, by and by, went up stairs again.&#xD;
"Why do you. not go, down?" I asked of Kate.&#xD;
"Mr. Stuart will not think this very kind treatment."&#xD;
Emma looked at me in surprise. "I should not&#xD;
wonder if' they were engaged," It said to her, as soon,&#xD;
as Kate had rustled her heavy silk out of' hearing.&#xD;
"Suppose you 'and Mary entertain uncle Tom in the&#xD;
library until I change my hair; it is so tight, it hurts&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Afterward, rising from my knees to cool my bead&#xD;
in the night air, before joining uncle Tom, I saw Gii~&#xD;
bert standing in the garden with Kate, tearing the&#xD;
sweet June roses from my bushes, and, when tired of&#xD;
playing with them, tossing them, leaf by leaf, intothQ&#xD;
fountain.&#xD;
It was "ar way he had."&#xD;

CHAPTER IL&#xD;
MY uncle Tom was an old bachelor, who had lov-&#xD;
ed the ladies so well in his youth that he could never&#xD;
decide on one to bless his age, to the exclusion of so&#xD;
many others. *Not but that my uncle was young yet,&#xD;
and, thanks to his whiskers, which were astonishing,&#xD;
aud to his income, which was equally flourishing, he&#xD;
was still in good demand.&#xD;
lie was a glorious fellow; his hand, his heart, his&#xD;
house, and his pursewere as open as the generous sun-&#xD;
shine, and I, his nearest relative, a sisterless, brother-&#xD;
lessorphan, seemed to be the one point on which he&#xD;
centered all the affections of his ever warm heart.&#xD;
Love, from my earliest recollection, had been my&#xD;
breath of life, but a long line of rock-moulded ances-&#xD;
tore, lighting, generation after generation, with all&#xD;
fornis and shapes of care and wrong, had transmitted&#xD;
to me, the last of their line, the strength of soul wrung&#xD;
from' the accumulated trials and triumphs of their&#xD;
struggling lives.&#xD;
Like them, I was formed of the rugged Yew Eng.'&#xD;
&#xD;
land granite, though my uncle's delicate chiseling,&#xD;
and the graceful draping of steady happiness, made&#xD;
me seem as if moulded from less enduring, but&#xD;
more polished material. I do not know that uncle&#xD;
To~ ever suspected the real under the seeming. He&#xD;
caressed me like a baby, he dressed me, he feted me,&#xD;
as if I had been born only to be borne through the&#xD;
world in a jewelled car, over a pathway of roses. He&#xD;
had but one object in life, as far as I was concerned,&#xD;
and that was that I might equal my "glorious moth-&#xD;
er."&#xD;
My "glorious mother," who, as Mrs. Glynn had&#xD;
so imprudently toldme, died in the dark and cold,&#xD;
on the open field, not half a mile from her husband's&#xD;
door!&#xD;
Our house in summer had always some visitors;&#xD;
~on the summer of which I have spoken it was full to&#xD;
its utmost limits, our party having been augmented on&#xD;
the day before the opening. of my story, by the-arrival&#xD;
of my only fashionable relative, my aunt Graham, her&#xD;
daughter Florence, lady's maid, and countless trunks;&#xD;
my cousin Hal, "Lady Louise," his fast mare, his sad~&#xD;
dle, buggy, gun, and fishing-tackle; and my unek~&#xD;
~t'aham, who, however, had only taken a run down to&#xD;
see his wife and train safely landed at her brother's.&#xD;
My aunt Graham was the only woman whom I was&#xD;
forced to regard as so immensely my superior that&#xD;
during her visits I always looked upon myself as the&#xD;

&#xD;
plainest, dowdiest, stupidest mortal in existence She&#xD;
'denounced my grandest dresses as "1~ights," and my'&#xD;
way of wearing my hair she regarded as "too shook-&#xD;
)rg for any thing."&#xD;
Her whole soul was bent on marrying off Florence,&#xD;
who was now in her eighteenth year, and, despite he~&#xD;
really good face and slender figure, was unengaged.&#xD;
My duties as a well-behaved relative and' polite host-&#xD;
ess required, in my aunt Graham's eyes, that I should&#xD;
introduce all the eligible young men of our acquaint-&#xD;
ance to Florence, retiring immediately afterward to&#xD;
the background.&#xD;
Before my aunt Qraham came, she had written&#xD;
to Kate-she would not have dared do so to either&#xD;
my uncle Tom or me-to know who were at "the&#xD;
house," and before she had, been two hours in the par-&#xD;
lor I saw that she had selected the victim whose sac-&#xD;
rifice. was to be the result of the summer's campaign.&#xD;
And~in her selection' I must say my aunt Graham&#xD;
showed the taste and high ambition which, she often&#xD;
assured me, were indispensable to a really fashionable&#xD;
lady's "making-up." Carlton Aberthnay, on whom fell&#xD;
her choice, was one of our most admired friends. He&#xD;
was a South Carolinian bybirth, and more, a 'real Caroli-&#xD;
nian, one of the almost mythical First Families of the&#xD;
South, with just enough 'of Yew England training to&#xD;
steady the Southern impetuosity with which he was.&#xD;
lavishly endowed. G~nerous'and impulsive, brave and&#xD;
&#xD;
courteous, high-toned and chivalric, there was no door&#xD;
or heart that could be long closed to him.&#xD;
Had Kate said nothing of his well-stocked planta-&#xD;
tions, of his almost unlimited expectations, my aunt&#xD;
Graham would have read the consciousness of wealth&#xD;
and position in. the unassuming ease and graceful mod-&#xD;
esty which, to less experienced eyes than those of the&#xD;
sharp woman of the world with a daughter to settle,&#xD;
would have been the last sign looked for.&#xD;
I cannot say that the light I saw in Gilbert Stu-&#xD;
art's eyes had blinded me to all the good in. other men,&#xD;
so that they passed dimly before me, darkly as in a&#xD;
glass, but I do know that as we all met in the parlor,&#xD;
a day or two after that scene with Gilbert, and one&#xD;
woman-glance of mine shut out that light, other men&#xD;
came out from the background and shone in more dis-&#xD;
tinct colors. And it was then, I think, that as Carlton&#xD;
Aberthn~y stood by .Florence's chair; guiding her&#xD;
through the intricacies of a Chinese puzzle, that I saw&#xD;
in his countenance something I had never seen in any&#xD;
other's, not even in Gilbert's ;-certainly 'not, in, Gil~&#xD;
bert's. -&#xD;
I can~ scarcely tell you what it was, it was so spir-&#xD;
itual, so aspiring, so pure, so real, yet so fervid. Some-&#xD;
thing that made me blush for the material, earthly&#xD;
kind of existence that I led-I, a woman, who ought&#xD;
to~walk in heaven's' ways, leading men with me, not&#xD;
to stand afar- off wondering at. it in another's, The&#xD;

&#xD;
same -look, with less of determination, more of tender&#xD;
humility-, equally pure, but more spiritual still, was al-&#xD;
ways shining out of Mary Allen's sweet hazel eyes.&#xD;
Wbile I watched that light in Carlton Aberthnay's&#xD;
face, my cousin Hal. had evidently seen the same in&#xD;
M~~~'s,~for I saw him sitting by her, with more of in-&#xD;
terest and refinement in bis appearance than had ever&#xD;
been won from him by the brightest "belle of the&#xD;
balE"&#xD;
"I can never do it," at last sighed Florence, look-&#xD;
ing pitifully up to Mr. Aberthnay.&#xD;
"Really? why, Miss Georgie did it at once. She&#xD;
can explain it better than I;" and he turned to me,&#xD;
much to Florence's disgust; she, however, maintained&#xD;
a show of interest while I coldly and rapidly explain-&#xD;
ed.~&#xD;
To get her a-way from me, Mrs. Graham called her&#xD;
to the piano, but Mr. Aberthnay did not follow; he,'&#xD;
sat with me by the low French window, looking 'out&#xD;
on the river.&#xD;
He talked well, better than usual, for Florence had&#xD;
rested his intellect, and it was ready for a fresh start.&#xD;
His manner had always suited me as a 'relief from&#xD;
the cold, unenthusiastic, undemonstrative ways of the&#xD;
North; and, now that I was becoming' harde~0a from&#xD;
the-joyous-hearted, impulsive girl, to the stately, sar-&#xD;
castio woman, it did me good to mark the flow of his&#xD;
i~~petuous nature. It amused me, leaning back in my&#xD;
&#xD;
chair, refusing to lose myself in poetry or romance, to&#xD;
hear him, excited to the utmost, paint for me his&#xD;
dreams of the future. His especial ambition was mili-&#xD;
tary renown; the pomp of battle was to him earth's&#xD;
grandest romance. "I shall wait," he would often tell&#xD;
me, "until some oppressed nation, with whose ~princi-&#xD;
ples I can fully sympathize, rises against the 'oppress-&#xD;
or, and join them, as Lafayette did the Colonists, as-.--"&#xD;
"Byron the Greeks," I once interrupted him. "No,&#xD;
no. Earth has many. ways to fame, and honor should&#xD;
be every man's aim; but war is butchery, slaughter,&#xD;
adorn it as you wilL"&#xD;
~But I never moved him; and was nearer being&#xD;
converted myself; for, after all, what man or woman&#xD;
is great and good enough to be deaf to, the fife and&#xD;
drum, or blind when "Horses prance and lances&#xD;
gleam"? I found refuge in the magnetism of his&#xD;
cheerful nature from my own thoughts. So I bore,&#xD;
listening to him, without a word of complaint, t~he&#xD;
dull, hard pain that was gnawing all the sweetness&#xD;
and blessedness out of my life. I meant to be true&#xD;
and just to Carlton Aberthnay, that' he might never&#xD;
suffer, if indeed men ever, do suffer, as I was suffering&#xD;
then. I knew that his ever courteous manner had a&#xD;
shade of reverence in it for me that it had for no&#xD;
other; mine to him was ever 'frank and cordial. Be-&#xD;
yond that I meant that neither should go. I was tired&#xD;
of love, tired of hearing of' it, tired of reading of it,&#xD;

* tired of living for it, and I meant there should be none&#xD;
of it, between Canton Abertlinay and me.&#xD;
Indeed Floi~ence Was determined on the same point,&#xD;
and so contrived it that Canton would have been&#xD;
more or less than man, could he have had a whole&#xD;
heart to offer any other than herself&#xD;
My cousin Hal, who, weak as he was, was beyond&#xD;
his excellent mother's control, had "paired off" with&#xD;
Mary since the first evening of their meeting. Kate&#xD;
and Gilbert were almost equally exclusive, or I fan-&#xD;
cied so; Emma, Uncle 'Tom, Aunt Graham, Mr. Ab-&#xD;
erthnay, an~I myself were left to be as entertaining to&#xD;
each other as possible under the circumstances. Gil-&#xD;
bert Stuart came and went very much as of old, and.&#xD;
among so many a~ff'iire8 dz~ eceur, my little trouble&#xD;
passed unnoticed. How weak I. must seem when I con-&#xD;
fess that my heart still ached for Gilbert. If by so&#xD;
doing I could have preserved his present esteem, and&#xD;
the hope that even yet was not dead, I would have&#xD;
considered it happiness to follow him around the world&#xD;
as the meekest of. servants, living years on a smile,&#xD;
braving death for a loving look. Only that I knew&#xD;
he would despise me for it, how I would have knelt&#xD;
and begged for his love!&#xD;
But well for me the delicate face, Kate's idealized&#xD;
face, was always before me, standing, like the Angel&#xD;
with the drawn sword, betWeen me and paradise. And&#xD;
Kate herself-! Sometimes I almost pitied her in her&#xD;
&#xD;
faint prettiness, as my uncle's rich-set mirrors flashed&#xD;
back my royally-out features and my deep autumnal&#xD;
coloring. I asked Kate nothing. I asked myself noth-&#xD;
ing. I never analyzed my feelings, only, 'when sev-&#xD;
ered from the being in which my own had been so&#xD;
long absorbed, and the responsibility of my own life&#xD;
and happiness came back to me, only then I longed to&#xD;
throw myself into his arms, hide my head on his heart,&#xD;
and pray him to take me back to the love which I still&#xD;
believed had been, still was mine.&#xD;
Was that my greatest folly?&#xD;
Well, at least I kept it to myself. I went through&#xD;
the almost daily agony of meeting and parting, with&#xD;
a self-possession that astonishes me now, and must&#xD;
have cQmpletely blinded him.&#xD;
During the earlier summer months Gilbert had oft-&#xD;
en been my escort, on Sundays, to church at the con-&#xD;
vent where Mary Allen was then at schooL Her va~&#xD;
cation had commenced during the week, but on the&#xD;
first Sunday after the strange conversation with Gil-&#xD;
bert, I proposed going to church there, as usual for af-&#xD;
ternoon service.&#xD;
"Who are for the convent?" I asked, with less in-&#xD;
difference to the answer than became a polite and im-&#xD;
partial hostess. "Xow, don't all speak at once!"&#xD;
"I am at your service as usual," answered Mr.&#xD;
Stuart, looking steadily at me.&#xD;
"As I did not want to speak all at once,"~r.&#xD;

Aberthnay said, before I had replied to Gilbert, "I&#xD;
have lost the opportunity of putting myself in the&#xD;
way of getting an inside view of that mysterious build-&#xD;
ing. Do pity me, kind Miss Vane."&#xD;
"I do," I said; "but there is no reason why yoa&#xD;
should not go to-day, the larger the party the bet-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
"I am restored to happiness," Mr. Aberthnay&#xD;
said, smilingly, and began an argument with Kate on&#xD;
religious life, which was conducted with great spirit&#xD;
on both sides, for Carl's religion was a quiet part of&#xD;
him, and Kate was the most rigid of Presbyterians.&#xD;
"Stop arguing," I had to say, at last, "and let us&#xD;
decide how we shall go."&#xD;
"Miss Mary is going with me in my buggy," Hal&#xD;
answered, promptly; "I will show her a horse as is a&#xD;
horse."&#xD;
" You will very likely see too much of that horse;&#xD;
Mary," I said. "If you ~have any regard for your&#xD;
friends, go with me in sober style."&#xD;
"Mr. Graham says Lad~y Louise is as gentle as a&#xD;
lamb under his guidance," Mary answered. "I am&#xD;
not afraid, and I like to drive fast."&#xD;
"Very good beginning for a novice," I thought,&#xD;
but decided not to interfere. When this important&#xD;
matter was settled, it was proposed that the two gen-&#xD;
tlemen and I should walk, and then began some little&#xD;
eeremoniou~ politeness between Messrs. Aberthnay&#xD;
&#xD;
and Stuart; which showed each wished the other a&#xD;
thousand miles a~way.&#xD;
Finally, Mr. Aberthenay came privately to me and&#xD;
gave me to understand that some other day we could&#xD;
go, but that as I had generally gone with Mr. Stuart,&#xD;
and so on. He should not enjoy a pleasure at the risk&#xD;
of interfering with Mr. Stuart's rights.&#xD;
"Rights!" I echoed; "this is the first I have heard&#xD;
of Mr. Stuart's rights!"&#xD;
"How shall I express my meaning, then?"&#xD;
"I do not know your meaning, nor care. I have&#xD;
known Mr. Stuart ever since I can remember, but if I&#xD;
had known him a thousand years I should not consid-&#xD;
er he had any right to my society."&#xD;
"On that account, no."&#xD;
"Not on any account. He visits here as uncle&#xD;
Tom's friend, and, some people think, it'is just possible,&#xD;
my cousin-"&#xD;
I felt ashamed of having said so much. Mr. Ab-&#xD;
erthnay saw that I did, and vry quietly said:&#xD;
"I had no idea of annoying you; I beg you will&#xD;
forgive me."&#xD;
"There is nothing to forgive. Come, now, it is&#xD;
time for us to make ourselves ready for church. After&#xD;
vespers very likely they will show you around that&#xD;
mysterious building."&#xD;
Our arrangements ended without including Mr.&#xD;
Stuart, who chose to find e~couse for withdrawing for&#xD;

seasons of his own, perhaps because Kate, who could&#xD;
not be persuaded to put her foot inside a convent,&#xD;
caine down, looking quite as pretty as. usual, just as&#xD;
we were talking.&#xD;
I have always thought if I should wake up after&#xD;
days of sleep or unconsciousness on a Sunday, that I&#xD;
* should know the day by the very freshness and still-&#xD;
ness of the air. A sweeter Sunday there could not&#xD;
be than that one on which Mr. Aberthnay and I took&#xD;
our first walk together; and took that walk over the&#xD;
* very ground where Gilbert Stuart and I had wander-&#xD;
ed a hundred times, in the easy joyousness of the&#xD;
bright years. of my life. Nothing, not even that reve-&#xD;
lation of his, had seemed to show so cJearly our&#xD;
broken trust, as that I walked there with another&#xD;
man at my side.&#xD;
How different it was! Yet my present companion&#xD;
was one any womart could be proud to be with, and&#xD;
against whose cheerful society and gentle deference few&#xD;
hearts could find it in them to rebel. No more refer-&#xD;
ence was made to Mr. Stuart ; and Mr. Aberthnay had&#xD;
never been more interesting.&#xD;
"This is really a charming town," he said to me*&#xD;
in the interval of graver conversation. "I keep liking&#xD;
it more the more I see of it. r remember your&#xD;
speaking of it to me the summer I met you at West&#xD;
Point, and my thinking to myself that I had seen all&#xD;

the usual remark that every N~ew England village is&#xD;
a fac-simile of every other. I did not think then that&#xD;
my fate would ever station me so near to it, any more&#xD;
than I imagined that I should ever have courage to&#xD;
speak a dozen consecutive sentences to the 'Miss&#xD;
Vane,' who was so fair and stately, that ~ve cadets&#xD;
trembled at our own audacity in asking her to dance."&#xD;
"And Miss Vane, I assure you, looked upon each&#xD;
particular cadet as a mountain of wisdom, wit, and&#xD;
majesty. So our illusions leave us at every step."&#xD;
"Some we say good-bye to with all our hearts,"&#xD;
he answered; "some we would rather die than lose.&#xD;
I have lost one to-day; I trust it will not come back."&#xD;
"Oh?" I said, but I did not ask him what it was.&#xD;
"Yes; but it is terribly selfish in me to be glad."&#xD;
It struck me just then that he meant something in&#xD;
regard to Mr. Stuart and me. We had been quite&#xD;
often spoken of asengaged, and, nb doubt, Mr. Aberth-&#xD;
nay hi~d had information to that effect.' I thought I&#xD;
had undeceived him, however, for the future.&#xD;
"Do you really mean that sweet little girl serious-&#xD;
ly intends becoming a nun?" Mr. Aberthnay asked&#xD;
me, when, a few minutes late; Hal and Mary dashed&#xD;
by us at a rate not at. all in vogue among New Eng-&#xD;
landers on Sund~y, and no more in accordance with&#xD;
my own views of proper respect to the day. Mary, I&#xD;
knew, would never venture to express any objection to&#xD;
Hal, up to whom she looked with great respect and&#xD;

&#xD;
perfect ignorance of any fault possible in him. Her&#xD;
little mind had never been exercised in separating the&#xD;
true from the false, the real from the seeming; certain&#xD;
things were articles of faith with her; certain other&#xD;
things she regarded and shunned with holy horror,&#xD;
just as she had been taught.&#xD;
"Yes," I said, "she does intend to' become a nun."&#xD;
"Miss Mary seems just made for a nun,'~ Mr.&#xD;
Aberthnay remarked. "She is just our ideal 'nun;&#xD;
tender and sweet, simple and meek; she might have&#xD;
sat for Tennyson's St. Agnes."&#xD;
* "Surely if there is any truth in a vocation, Mary&#xD;
'has it," I said; "she knows of no world outside the&#xD;
oQnvent, and I do not think she will outgrow her pres-&#xD;
ent ignorance; it is to be hoped for lier own peace&#xD;
of mind that she will not. But herewe ~are at the&#xD;
convent."&#xD;
We found Mary ldssing nuns and girls indiscrimi-&#xD;
nately. I ,myself could not deny that there was a&#xD;
certainn pleasant'~charm around the pale-faced sisterhood&#xD;
who had dragged me through the "elements" of Eng-&#xD;
lish, French, German, Italtan, music, and drawing,&#xD;
not to mention embroidery. The parlors were crowd-&#xD;
ed with girls and their visitors, my heart ached for&#xD;
the poor lonely ones who had none, and leaving the&#xD;
parlor I found my way to the long class-room, and for&#xD;
the sake of old times tried to endure the confusion&#xD;
that was4 the natural consequence of a hundred and&#xD;
&#xD;
fifty girls all talking at once. "I 'did not go crazy&#xD;
ther&amp;amp;," I thought, remembering my school days. "Noth-&#xD;
ing will drive me crazy now."&#xD;
A few words here and there, a glance' at my old&#xD;
desk, and a glance through the window by which I&#xD;
had lived so many feverisl~ lives, and my mission there&#xD;
was ended. Just as I left, the bell rang for afternoon&#xD;
service, and the tumult was in a measure hushed;&#xD;
white veils fluttered from all parts of the room, while&#xD;
I hastened to join my cousin and Mr. Aberthnay in&#xD;
the parlor. Mary was taking her old place among&#xD;
the girls.'&#xD;
The beautiful chapel was still' as death as we en-&#xD;
tered, nor did the long procession of white-veiled girls&#xD;
much disturb its silence. Here every thing was saint-&#xD;
ly, calm, and sweet. My lost girlhood, my proud, am-&#xD;
bitious girlhood, with its wild aspirations, its grand&#xD;
imaginings, its foyal hopes, rose u~ before me, until I&#xD;
cowered before the memory. And while the nuns'&#xD;
sweet voices blended with those of the girls, had all&#xD;
the world been there I could not have repressed the&#xD;
tears that seemed wrung out of my very heart. I had&#xD;
~been wishing for them ever since that night. I felt&#xD;
better when they came.&#xD;
"Only a few weeks more," Mary whispered, as she&#xD;
bade the nuns 'farewelL "Only a. few weeks ~more&#xD;
and I shall be always with you; but it is a 'long time&#xD;
to wait."&#xD;

* "Patience, my child," one answered. "Our Lord&#xD;
will repay yow tenfold for waiting. It is better you&#xD;
should see the world, and know it, so that if you&#xD;
should be ever tempted to wish for its vanities, you&#xD;
may remember what they are worth. Go, dear; God&#xD;
in heaven bless you, and his holy Mother protect you&#xD;
from all the snares~ of the wicked."&#xD;
I fancied, as the nun said this, that she had had at&#xD;
least a glimpse of Hal's well-trimmed whiskers.&#xD;
"I suppose they are sincere," Mr. Aberthnay said,&#xD;
as we left the convent. "They live on another plane&#xD;
than ours, speaking after the manner of the 'spiritual-&#xD;
ists.' I believe the~r mean all they say."&#xD;
"Indeed they do," I exclaimed. "No one could&#xD;
live so except sustained by the faith ihat God wills it.&#xD;
Who can tell-do they become mere machines, mere&#xD;
creatures of habit, after a time, or is their self abnega-&#xD;
tion a perpetually offered sacrifice? As we haVe seen&#xD;
them, how near to heaven they seem! And oh! who&#xD;
would not throw down life's burdens to possess the re.&#xD;
pose we saw there?"&#xD;
"Not I, for one!" cried Mr. Aberthnay; "I thank&#xD;
God that life I&amp;amp;as burdens. Repose is not for me; no,&#xD;
nor for you either, Miss Vane. I thank heaven for&#xD;
the energy and the activity that scorns rest."&#xD;
"You are wrong there, the greater the activity&#xD;
the~ sweeter th~ repose. Who sleeps best, the hard-&#xD;
worked laborer, or the listless,. languid 'child of fash-&#xD;
&#xD;
ion'? If any graybeards were here they would laugh&#xD;
at us for thinking, at our* age, of rest, either to scorn&#xD;
or to woo it. Yet what right have they? The heart&#xD;
)~noweth its own litterness."&#xD;
"I want a regular pow-wow with you to night,"'&#xD;
said Hal to me on the way to tea.&#xD;
"What is a pow-wow," I said to Hal.&#xD;
"A pow-woW," he answered, "is a thundering big&#xD;
talk. A consultation like."&#xD;
"Oh! " I said, and promised. As soon as I had&#xD;
opportunity I led the way to my own special sanctum,&#xD;
in which foot of man had never entered.&#xD;
"Well, Hal," I said, as he sat down.&#xD;
"But, Georgie, do go someWhere else; I want to&#xD;
smoke. I never qan get it out if I don't smoke."&#xD;
I looked at my snowy curtains, my spotless carpet,&#xD;
my neat books, my delicate flowers, my pictures, and&#xD;
my hundred little "f~mininities," and wondered how&#xD;
it would seem.&#xD;
"Harry," I said, "you may smoke."&#xD;
* "Georgie, you're bully," Hal said, looking for a&#xD;
match, "a regular P. B.;" and having lighted his&#xD;
cigar, he put his boots a little above his head, break-&#xD;
ing only a vase and an ornamental tea cup in the op-&#xD;
eration. I have noticed that when men open their&#xD;
mouths to smoke, their feet, as a seemingly natural&#xD;
consequence, seem to go up to the highest resting-place&#xD;
at hand. I have never been able to explain the phe.&#xD;

be will. I will do it. I'll do it if it kills me. If the&#xD;

I'll sell my gun, I'll give up Lady Louise, I'll give up&#xD;

much-and I'll do it, wouldn't you?"&#xD;
"Decidedly!"&#xD;
"She's just perfect, just as pious as any angel; will&#xD;

the rub."&#xD;

"Oh, that's easy.&#xD;
"The dickens it is! Did you ever try it?"&#xD;
"No, Hal, I confess I never did."&#xD;
"That's the plague of it; kow to do iii? I have&#xD;
asked her out to drive to-morrow, and I'll ask her&#xD;
then. What shall I say?"&#xD;
"Let that depend upon the way things come around.&#xD;
Just as if an old flirt like you would have any trouble!"&#xD;
"But this is different. I positively believe I'm&#xD;

bad if she shouldn't see it as I do."&#xD;
"Perhaps you had better give her more time.".&#xD;
"Nary. I must know at once. Bless my Nsoul I&#xD;

* Hal was as good as his word, and plumply pro-&#xD;
posed to her at the end of their drive, and was, of&#xD;
course, decidedly refused. But Mary was a perfect&#xD;
novice in the* affairs of the heart; and when Hal told&#xD;
her that he had an income large enough for two to&#xD;
live on, with a little economy and some help from the&#xD;
Governor, and that rather than see her immured in a&#xD;
convent he would sacrifice himself on the altar of&#xD;
matrimony, Mary thought pretty much as her hopeful&#xD;
lover did himself, that he was the most generous of&#xD;
men, and assured him, without the least embarrassment&#xD;
or flutter, that she never meant to marry, that she was&#xD;
going 'to be a nun, that her "vocation~~ was decidedly&#xD;
to a religious life,, in which she would always pray for&#xD;
him for being so good as to be Willing to sell his house~&#xD;
and stop smoking for her, when she had never done&#xD;
any thing for him; and then she talked so beautifully&#xD;
about the sanctity of single-blessedness" and cQnvent&#xD;
shades, and dwelt so tenderly on the skinless life of&#xD;
prayer and meditation before her, that Hal was, at the&#xD;
end, almost ready to emulate the knight of old, who&#xD;
built a hermit's cell under the windows of the convent&#xD;
in which his lady love had, in a moment of despair,&#xD;
yowed t~ liv~ her earthly life,&#xD;

as a man can have. Jack and I used to say that, if it&#xD;
wasn't for the expense, matrimony was the best school&#xD;
of reform; and sometimes, when we've been to see&#xD;
some of. the fellows that have gone into that blessed&#xD;
state, I'll be hanged if we haven't felt like dashing the&#xD;
expense. I can't talk much, but you know what. I&#xD;
mean, and that's more than I can say for most women.&#xD;
If I'd had a sister like you,,I believe I'd been some-&#xD;
thing, I do positively. Now, if I could talk like you,&#xD;
cousin Oeorgie, I know I could bring Mary to my&#xD;
way of thinking; but I can't, and there it is."&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
"WHAT a bore this world is," half yawned, half'&#xD;
growled Hal, as the end of the week satisfied him that&#xD;
his 'sacrifice' was not to be accepted.. "What ~ bore&#xD;
this woi'ld is, especially the part they call the country."&#xD;
"Which seems to be the unanimous opinion of the&#xD;
company," Kate sftid, after a pause which brought no&#xD;
contradiction to Hal's assertion. "What is the matter&#xD;
with everybody? Mr. Stuart, you look as blue as a&#xD;
church mouse, what ails you?"&#xD;
"Nothing, I assure you; I was never in better&#xD;
spirits in my life."&#xD;
"And Georgie never in Worse; what dose it all&#xD;
mean? Is it because Mr. Aberthnay is going away&#xD;
to-morrow?"&#xD;
I don't know which said "no," with the least&#xD;
truth, Gilbert or I.&#xD;
"'A penny for your thoughts,' Mr. Aberthnay,"&#xD;
Kate continued; "speak your mind and receive your&#xD;
reward," and she displayed a shining "one cent"&#xD;
piece.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My thoughts, Miss Kate? Not worth a penny,&#xD;
far less your kind interest."&#xD;
"Oh, then I am sure you were thinking of some-&#xD;
thing you would not like me to know; you Southexn-&#xD;
ers do not rate your thoughts so cheaRly."&#xD;
"Poor as my thoughts are, Miss Kate, I'll take&#xD;
your penny; never yet did a Northerner fail to get&#xD;
the best of' a bargain with one of us, rate we ourselves&#xD;
ever so highly. I was thinking, then, that to-morrow&#xD;
I must up and away-to see you all again,. who can&#xD;
say when? i was wondering, too, where all this&#xD;
pleasant company would be this time twelve months!&#xD;
There was more sadness in the wonder than you think,&#xD;
Miss Kate. Have I earned my penny?"&#xD;
"Twice over," she answered readily. "Well, I&#xD;
for one expect to be immured in solemn Salem walls,&#xD;
unless Uncle Tom sends for me, in which happy&#xD;
event I shall probably be here-giving away pen-&#xD;
nies to make moody young gentlemen agreeable;&#xD;
who knows?"&#xD;
"And I, ditto, or something not much better,"&#xD;
said Hal, "unless I emigrate to China, Australia,&#xD;
Jersey, or the Fejee Islands, as I am sorely tempted&#xD;
sometimes. This is such a dull world. Say, Carl,&#xD;
can't you get up a nigger row down South to give us&#xD;
some excitement?"&#xD;
"Keep your energies, Friend Hal, for something&#xD;
more than a 'nigger row.' Hermetically sealed they&#xD;

won't spoil, and, perhaps, will pay for the keeping," t&#xD;
Mr. Abertlinay replied.&#xD;
Kate made a comical face. "I question that," she&#xD;
said. "What can he ever do with them, unless in&#xD;
domestic spars; and Hal is always going to be an old&#xD;
bachelor, ain't you Hal ?"&#xD;
Hal looked dolefully at Mary, but answered not.&#xD;
"Even so," said Mr. Aberthnay. "Ours is a glori-&#xD;
ous Union. You at the North are the hard-fisted,&#xD;
strong-minded, close-handed husband; we of the&#xD;
South, the impulsive warm-hearted wife ;-here's&#xD;
chance for domestic spars, even for old bachelors&#xD;
like Hal."&#xD;
"We have heard of these things before," remarked&#xD;
a visitor, "and have learned to appreciate them.~"'&#xD;
"You do not appreciate them~" Mr. Aberthnay&#xD;
answered hotly, "or you would know better than to&#xD;
sneer at them. Some day you will appreciate them."&#xD;
* "Pray keep your politics for your after dinner&#xD;
cigars," I said,' rising. "Let us have a walk in the&#xD;
garden."&#xD;
Mr. Abertlinay was the first to accept the invita-&#xD;
tion, and we together led the way. Finding even the&#xD;
porch cooler than I expected, I returned alone for a&#xD;
shawl. I found quite a group around Kate.&#xD;
"Hang these officers," one said with more empha~&#xD;
sis than politeness, "they give theniselves so many&#xD;
airs;                    -&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
".1 hate Southerner~," said Kate, to humor the&#xD;
spirit of the company~ "they are too conceited for any&#xD;
thing."            I&#xD;
I lingered to hear Gilbert answer: "You should&#xD;
except Mr. Aberthnay,. he is perfectly unassuming&#xD;
and unselfish'; how could he have said less?"&#xD;
Years after Gilbert Stuart owed his life to those&#xD;
simple words. I oiily thought, hearing them, that he&#xD;
did not care enough to be even jealous, for there was&#xD;
no superhuman virtue shielding a rival in that cahu,&#xD;
voice, I thought.&#xD;
"Mr. Aberthnay must feel almost a, stranger&#xD;
among us," I said, as I returned with my 'shawl, "and&#xD;
since he~ has been ordered to our part of the country&#xD;
has done all in his power to please us all. We ought&#xD;
not to visit the sins of his country upon one who has&#xD;
so few of his own."&#xD;
I dkl not look at Gilbert, but passed on to the&#xD;
porch. where Mr. Aberthnay awaited me. I had&#xD;
spoken incautiously loud, and I saw at once that he&#xD;
had heard me. He drew my hand over his arm.&#xD;
" It is such words as those, it is such women as you,&#xD;
that piece the ~broken links," he said, rapidly; "that&#xD;
bind us firmer together than all the parchment scrolls&#xD;
on earth! Something more than pollt~cal cords,&#xD;
something more than even ~ocial bands must be broken /&#xD;
I&#xD;
first, our very heart strings must be torn apart, before&#xD;
it can be done!"&#xD;

I looked at him in surprise.&#xD;
"YOU do not 'believe it," he continued, "no one&#xD;
does. You laugh at me for an enthusiast, a dreamer,&#xD;
a mad prophet. There's a cloud above us, a cloud no&#xD;
larger than your hand; it will cover the sweet blue&#xD;
sky above us, and flood this fair land with blood t~s&#xD;
with rain; I tell you it will!"&#xD;
"How dare you," I cried, tuning to him; "how&#xD;
dare you, Carlton Aberthnay, in 'the face of this&#xD;
glorious night, through whose gleaming you can see&#xD;
the proud strength of Bunker Hill and Fanuell Hall,&#xD;
tell me they will ever be less yours than mine? In the&#xD;
Lace of these brave forests, no stronger, no firmer than&#xD;
the hearts that guard them; in the face of these fields&#xD;
of plenty tilled by the brawny arms that will never&#xD;
shame their toil, how dare you tell me they will ever&#xD;
* be needed for less peaceful labor? You stand in 'the&#xD;
very home of Freedom, and talk of danger to its 'loved&#xD;
and cherished land!"&#xD;
"~Yes, I talkof danger to that very land, for fair&#xD;
as it seems it is black with crime. Think of it, Miss&#xD;
Vane, I do not say as I see it, a soulless despotism,&#xD;
but as you see it every day-a land of extravagance,&#xD;
of social luxury, of utter' political rottenness and cor~&#xD;
eruption, and tell me 'what but a miracle can save its&#xD;
pillars from crumbling to dust, and its proud temple&#xD;
from falling to the earth a mass of blackened ruins.&#xD;
"Then the miracle will come, for God holds us in&#xD;

"Not as we are now. From our ruins shall arise&#xD;
the nation of which all mankind have dreamt. The&#xD;
veritable land of promise.~,&#xD;
"Not from our country's ruins; but from the ashes&#xD;
of the brand of evil in our midst. Burn out that vile&#xD;
outrage on humanity, and we are purified. Now we&#xD;
are not worthy to think of our mission."&#xD;
"You are an abolitionist, I see.~~&#xD;
"I am a human being, and must needs share the&#xD;
degradation of my kind. Their tears cry to heaven&#xD;
for vengeance, and justice demands tears for tears,&#xD;

There was a long silence.&#xD;
"Always met with that," he said, at last. "Be~&#xD;

always to be so? Is life always to be a helpless&#xD;

"God knows," I answered, thinking just then of&#xD;

with the current, and now, the sudden breakers.&#xD;

but I did not look.&#xD;

Mr. Abertlinay sprang from 'his place, and pressed&#xD;
my hands to his lips. "I thank you a thousand times&#xD;
even for this," he said, with his Southern impetuosity.&#xD;
"I shall never forget it."&#xD;
I did not see him after that.&#xD;
I was glad to reach my room after the tedioi~s re-&#xD;
mainder of the evening was over. I had to be alone&#xD;
by myself; or, at least, away from Mr. Stuart and Kate,&#xD;
to fortify myself; to assure myself that I had done&#xD;
right.&#xD;
How he loved me! ~~Of course I had known it all&#xD;
this time. I had felt it every day; revelled in it as a&#xD;
slight revenge for Gilbert's wound; had sought it,'&#xD;
when Gilbert's coldness had been more titan I could&#xD;
hear; and now I had thrown it away. Was it right?&#xD;
Was it right? How h~ loved me! II.~w his face had&#xD;
grown radiant in my presence ! I had seeti it day after&#xD;
day, and contrasted it with Gilbert's cold, calm de-&#xD;
,nieanor. How eagerly he had sprung to meet me! I&#xD;
had listened for his quick step, day after day, and&#xD;
each time thought of Gilbert's slow, steady walk.&#xD;
How he loved me! I might kneel in vain to Gilbert.&#xD;
One word would bring him to me, to be forever&#xD;
mine.&#xD;
- I tried to write that word, but proud, vain girl&#xD;
though I was, I was still woman enough to try invain.&#xD;
"I will go and talk to some of the girls to put this&#xD;
thing out of my head," I said to myself, and turned&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7997-00000020"/>&#xD;
toward Kate's room; but how could I hope to conquer&#xD;
myself with~' her against me? I was not good enough&#xD;
to hear Mary's eager hopes, so I went to~ Emma's&#xD;
room. It was very seldom I ever did so, for until&#xD;
lately-perliaps the change was my fault-Emma had&#xD;
always come to me.&#xD;
"It is I, Emma," I said, not waiting for my knock&#xD;
to be answered. "May I come in?"&#xD;
There was no reply, the room was quite dark; for&#xD;
a moment I was almost frightened, the next I thought&#xD;
that the silly girl was probably in some cozy corner&#xD;
dreaming of her lover over the seas, as we always&#xD;
called~ him.&#xD;
I lighted the gas~ with careless freedom, and, as I&#xD;
anticipated, quickly discovered Emma sitting by the&#xD;
window with her head on her arms.&#xD;
"Dreaming, awake or asleep," I asked, raising her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
A tearful face tried to hide itself from me.&#xD;
"Tears!" I exclaimed, preparing myself for the&#xD;
story of some lover's quarrel. How small, how child-&#xD;
ish seemed all other griefs compared td mine! "What&#xD;
has gone wrong now ? What right has anybody in&#xD;
this house to cry away from me. What is it?"&#xD;
"I cannot tell you, I can never tell any one.&#xD;
Please Vut out the light; I don't want it."&#xD;
I put it out, aud drew Emma nearer to nie, and, by&#xD;
and by, she told me her "little tale."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have been deceiving you. all the time," she said.&#xD;
"I have let you believe all about that man you&#xD;
thought I cared for, but it was not true; I do not care&#xD;
for him.~~&#xD;
"But you care for somebody; everybody cares for&#xD;
somebody?"&#xD;
"Everybody? Then you 'do; tell me is it~-"&#xD;
"After you, my love."&#xD;
"It is so silly; so like every thing else; just like a&#xD;
hundred stories; how I went around and saw so many&#xD;
people, and fancied one here, and one there; and said&#xD;
things that I did not mean, and had them misunder-&#xD;
stood; and said things in fun, and had them taken in&#xD;
earnest; until one day, oh! such a lovely, beautiful&#xD;
day, when my mind was all full of other things, I was&#xD;
taken into a room full of company, and as 'many as a&#xD;
dozen gentlemen were all introduced to me at once,&#xD;
and I just bowed to them all, and was tired and wished&#xD;
them all gone, when one said something that made&#xD;
me look up to his facs~, and-now I know~ you are&#xD;
going to laugh-but it is true, just as we read in&#xD;
books, and never believe, I felt some one say, that is,&#xD;
as plainly as if some one whispered it to me, 'It is all&#xD;
over now-you must love him always.' But I can't&#xD;
put it into words. I did not think much about it then;&#xD;
I accepted the conviction. He~ seemed to understand&#xD;
it; so did everybody else, and no one interfered with&#xD;
us. Oh! how I should love to tell yott all about those&#xD;

blessed days, I remember every hour of them. But it&#xD;
would tire you.&#xD;
I protested against this, but she was firm. "I did&#xD;
not want to tell anybody while every thing went on&#xD;
well, but it seems to me that I should believe it all if 1&#xD;
talked too much about it. I never coquetted with&#xD;
him; perhaps it would be better now if I had. I was&#xD;
too truthful, too trustful; men never love you half so&#xD;
well as when. you are indifferent to them."&#xD;
I almost thought so too.&#xD;
"I was too happy, too secure; I did not suppose&#xD;
any thing could happen, but something did. He&#xD;
would not listen to me, or when he did, in so cold&#xD;
and incredulous a way that I could not justify myself;&#xD;
and, after all, I had done nothing wrong."&#xD;
"How .long ago was this?"&#xD;
"Oh, long ago-about two. years."&#xD;
"V Tell, and then?"&#xD;
"I ought to marry somebody else, oughtn't I,&#xD;
Georgie?~ You know whom I mean. Of course he&#xD;
dees Dot love me now."&#xD;
"Of course not. Do you suppose if a man loved&#xD;
yau he could leave you two months, not to say two&#xD;
years, in doubt?"&#xD;
"I don't suppose he could. But I know if I shouki&#xD;
ever meet him again, it would all be as it was. I&#xD;
keep turning this over and over in my mind until I&#xD;
am half Wild. I have argued it from every point of&#xD;
view; and what to do I cannot say."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have no right to marry any man feeling so,"&#xD;
I answered decidedly. It is so easy to decide for&#xD;
another.&#xD;
"But I might love him ~afterwards ? '.'&#xD;
"It is too great a risk."&#xD;
"But I am afraid that, in my foolish despair, I&#xD;
have made it too late."&#xD;
"You are not married; it is never too late until&#xD;
then."&#xD;
"And then, Georgie, what do you suppose women&#xD;
do?"&#xD;
"Die; or pray to," I answered, in my old way.&#xD;
"It is not too late yet?"&#xD;
"No; but you have no time for hesitation."&#xD;
It is go easy to be strong for others.&#xD;
She relit the gas, and wrote a short note, which she&#xD;
handed me to read. It was a decided refusal.&#xD;
"After all, I feel relieved," she said, sealing it&#xD;
slowly, "and shall be more so when it is out of my&#xD;
power to recall this answer. - But it is hard; am I&#xD;
right to stand by that which may be only a delusion,&#xD;
and sacrifice half 'my life for it? Who knows?"&#xD;
After a silence she said:&#xD;
"I never doubted your fate, Georgie, until that&#xD;
night ~you told me you thought Mr. Stuart was en-&#xD;

away, but I never imagined wealth, station, or mere&#xD;
accomplishments, would weigh a feather in the bal-&#xD;

"Of themselves, never," I replied. "I do not care&#xD;
one iota for wealth or station, but I Jo' care for the&#xD;
mind that commands position. I do care for the spirit&#xD;
and the enterprise that walks boldly up and claims its&#xD;
own from the world. I do not believe these things&#xD;
are mere accidents, or the reward of' impudence. Fate&#xD;
and. Fortune are not so blind as ,they are represented.&#xD;
Now, I do not think any. combination of circumstances&#xD;
could make a great man of Gilbert Stuart ; it is not&#xD;
in him to be more than he is: calm, generous, and re-&#xD;
liable, always trusted, always respected; never a&#xD;
I&#xD;
leader."&#xD;
*" Who would be a leader if such qualities did not&#xD;
make him such? Who would be a crazy enthusiast,&#xD;
mad on one idea, whirled along to-day in a triumphal&#xD;
car by an excited populace, and thrown in the street&#xD;
to-marrow to make way for some equally mad succes-&#xD;
sor~? Not I, indeed. No, give me the man of even&#xD;
mind, of practical thought, quiet, calm, reliable; for,&#xD;
after all, he is the real leader. What a man to trust&#xD;
to, to live for, to die for! Why, Georgie, if such a&#xD;
one loved m~, I should worship the very earth that&#xD;
held him, and you do not?"&#xD;
"I do!" almost burst from my l4ps, but I answer~&#xD;
&#xD;
ed indifferently. "I am not given the 'choice. Well&#xD;
for me that I am not, perhaps, for all women are fools,&#xD;
when it comes to that. I should be false to all that is&#xD;
strongest and best in myself if I did ~not seize, at all&#xD;
hazards, the place where my work would be the hard-&#xD;
est and greatest.-"&#xD;
"You talk all sides, Georgie," interrupted Emma.&#xD;
"You would have me sacrifice life for love, and throw&#xD;
love to the winds yourself. How often have you said&#xD;
'the marriage rite is woman's best right?'"&#xD;
"For other people."&#xD;
" For you, and me, and everybody. There isn't any&#xD;
one to hear us; I will even put out~the light if you wish,&#xD;
so that we may not see each the other's foolish face as&#xD;
we confess that the world, with all its pomp and show,&#xD;
its wild and thrilling romance, its power and luxury,&#xD;
its grandeur and beauty, has no life to rival the life&#xD;
of a loved and loving wife; say it, GeQrgie."&#xD;
"The power and the luxury, the grandeur and&#xD;
beauty, the romance, the pomp and show, we all of' us&#xD;
know more or less about--have all seen something&#xD;
which was real and tangible in them; but who ever&#xD;

"Don't. be ridiculous, Georgie."&#xD;
"Grant that such a thing can be, is it not, after all,&#xD;

any merit if she secures her husband's comfoi% and&#xD;

what seem such are merely small prices that she pays&#xD;

ground, "some work that puts her talent out to inter-&#xD;

Aud all this to prove that you. are right in ~acri-&#xD;
ficing one of the beet and most generous of men to&#xD;

you mean Mr. Gilbert St~iart, permit me to inform&#xD;
you that it is not, and never has been in. my power to&#xD;
have the slightest influence on his destiny, 6ne way&#xD;

"I never thought you so unreasonable," Emma&#xD;
said. "You know the man loves you; everybody&#xD;
knows that. Only yesterday your jewel of 2a house~&#xD;

quickly, "and I would thank you, Emma, not to dis-&#xD;
cuss my affairs with my uncle's housekeeper.~~&#xD;
"Now, wherein have I offended your ladyship~?"&#xD;
Emma cried, quite undaunted by nay remark, the hard-&#xD;
est that had ever passed my lips. "It can't be Carl-&#xD;
ton-"&#xD;
"Why not?" I asked, haughtily, and asked with-&#xD;
out knowing why. "Why not Mr. Aberthnay ?."&#xD;
"There! Now, I see it all! Oh, Georgie, I&#xD;
thought you the truest, bravest, and sincerest woman&#xD;
in the world! So fall our idols at every step! You&#xD;
a flirt, a coquette, like all the rest! just as ready to&#xD;
throw aside a brave, true heart, for a heavier purse, as&#xD;
any of the rest! Where is your cousin Florence?~ II&#xD;
will make her my next idol; she fights under no false&#xD;
colors, at least. Just like all the rest, Georgie; so&#xD;
strong and brave for me, so weak and ambitious for&#xD;
yourself! '~&#xD;

for which he could not return even the semblance?&#xD;

loaded him with honor. So it should be. Till I died&#xD;

"Come," I said, "come and see if Mary is better&#xD;
contented than the rest of us."&#xD;
We entered her room softly. She was sleeping&#xD;
sweetly; the rosary she held in her hand under her&#xD;
head. had gently indented her rosy cheek, fair and soft&#xD;
as that of an infant's.&#xD;
"She must be dreaming of angels," Emma whis~&#xD;
pered.&#xD;
"While we have spent our thoughts on men," I&#xD;
added, ashamed of myself. "Who knows, Emma-it&#xD;
seems almost wicked to question it-who knows but,&#xD;
after all, Mary has chosen the better part?"&#xD;
~" Who knows?" Emma echoed; and her eyes, as&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
"WHY did you eyer let that handsome young sob&#xD;
dier off without warning me?" my, aunt Graham said&#xD;
to me the next morning, when it became fairly under-&#xD;
stood that half of the officers, among them Mr. Ab-&#xD;
erthnay, who had enlivened our little town for the past&#xD;
two years, had been ordered away. "Why did you&#xD;
not let me know?"&#xD;
"I. was not aware such an item would especially&#xD;
interest you," I answered.&#xD;
"Really? You are very short-sighted, I must say.&#xD;
But I won't scold you; I have had enough of that&#xD;
with Florence."&#xD;
"What has Florence been doing?" asked my un*&#xD;
cle. "Not flirting with our 'handsome young sob&#xD;
dier,' I hope, because I shall, then, have to scold too."&#xD;
"My daughter never flirts," Mrs. Graham answer-&#xD;
ed. "In truth, I almost wish she would, occasionally.&#xD;
She is too indifferent to please my fancy. I was just&#xD;
saying to her that she has treated Mr. Abervhnay&#xD;
very unkindly."&#xD;

&#xD;
I felt my eyes were dangerous, and looked out of&#xD;
the Window. What strange fate was it that made me&#xD;
always Mr. Abertlinay's champion? Was. it ~merely&#xD;
contempt for Florence and pride in myself that made&#xD;
me angry that her name should-be mentioned in con-&#xD;
nection with on~ who was so much my friend?&#xD;
"Very unkindly," Mrs. 'Graham rattled on. "Al-&#xD;
though Florence is the gentlest creature, atid the most&#xD;
artless in the world. At least, I think so; for Mi'.&#xD;
Abertlinay seems' to me a v~ry superior young gen-&#xD;
tleman, and it has pained me very much that Fbi'-&#xD;
"That Florence, what?" I asked, turning suddenly,&#xD;
as she made a pause-a pause which said more than&#xD;
words.&#xD;
My aunt played with the tassel of her morning&#xD;
dress and smiled.&#xD;
"You are in a very bad humor this morning, Cou-&#xD;
sin Georgie."&#xD;
"What were you going to say about Florence and&#xD;
Mr. Aberthnay?" I asked, not noticing her opiniQn of&#xD;
my humor.&#xD;
"About Florence and Mr. Aberthnay?" she re-&#xD;
peated. "What have I to say about them? I have&#xD;
always made it a point never to influence my children&#xD;
in any way, not even by a look; and whatever I might&#xD;
have wished, I give it up cheerfully, believing it to be~&#xD;
all for the best."&#xD;
&#xD;
Of course I did not believe one word of her insinu-&#xD;
ations; but Florence was one of my aversions, and&#xD;
every thing her mother said angered me.&#xD;
"So, Florence would not see Mr. Abertlinay with&#xD;
your eyes," I said, at last. "A thousand pities I Sup-&#xD;
josing Mr. Aberthnay should shoot himself; or do&#xD;
some horrible thing, how dreadful it would be!"&#xD;
"Are you two women going to fight?" Uncld~ Tom&#xD;
said, looking from one to the other with comical be-&#xD;
wilderment. "Because, 'pon honor, I can't. allow&#xD;
it."    /&#xD;
"Georgie is oi~iy a-little out of humor this morn-&#xD;
ing," my aunt answered. "She cannot help her na-&#xD;
ture, you know. I do not know' but I rather like her'~&#xD;
little tempers; they are amusiiig.- Florence, you&#xD;
know, never changes: she is always the same sweet-&#xD;
tempered child. I often wish she was not so much so.&#xD;
But I'll leave you, Georgie, to find your smiles again.&#xD;
Bye-bye."&#xD;
As she went out she dropped a letter from her lap&#xD;
'on the floor, but passed on without~ noticing it. Uncle&#xD;
Tom picked it up and threw it carelessly into my&#xD;
work-basket. I would no more have touched it than&#xD;
if it had been burning coal, but I could not help see-&#xD;

"What did she mean, Georgie?" Uncle Tom ask-&#xD;

down his paper with a tired gesture.&#xD;

SLOWLY the long summer came to an end. Our&#xD;
boats rocked idly on the river, which the falling leaves&#xD;
were already choking; our horses neighed unheeded&#xD;
in the stables, our voices echoed dully in the parlQrs,&#xD;
for our guests had departed; not all the splendor of a&#xD;
~ew England autumn could enliven our lonely house,&#xD;
and I knew not how.to face the sadness of the cold&#xD;

souls are at rest.&#xD;

CHAPTER Vt&#xD;
&#xD;
WHO glories 'not in the activity of real city life!&#xD;
The never-resting' crowd, pushing, jostling, pressing,&#xD;
hurrying each for his own particular goal; what life&#xD;
can be called life beside it? How the sluggish blood&#xD;
starts up and tingles through our vein8! How the&#xD;
languid nerves spring into action, as we mingle with&#xD;
our kind, straining like them, for power, wealth,&#xD;
fame, and happiness, each man for his owa idol! I&#xD;
Love the sweet; green fields, the far, blue sky, the&#xD;
dark, forest crowned hills, the n~urmuring brooks, the&#xD;
gushing rivers; but I revel in the noisy, rattling,&#xD;
stirring town, where God's last, best works are living.&#xD;
out their lives together.&#xD;
I felt my life renewed, even as the pent-up city&#xD;
denizen ienews his in the summer vacation. I&#xD;
retur~ied home, from those few days' shopping, strong.&#xD;
er, braver than I had been for months before; I&#xD;
could even think of meeting Florence, and my old&#xD;
enemy, my aunt Graham, with equanimity. A trial.&#xD;
which 'I was, however, spared, for they had flown off&#xD;
to the South for the winter arid 'spring.&#xD;
&#xD;
I remember ver~r well the night previous to our&#xD;
departure. I came down to our cozy little sitting-&#xD;
room, which was the favorite of all our lower rooms,&#xD;
in my travelling dress, alone, and with that peculiar&#xD;
feeling one has after locking drawers and packing&#xD;
trunks. My uncle Tom was in his library, deep in his&#xD;
papers, and giving, directions to everybody for the&#xD;
care of the 'house in his absence; a thorough old maid&#xD;
in this was my dear uncle Tom. A long dreary No-&#xD;
vember storm had desolated the streets of ~ur never&#xD;
very lively little village, and fearing no intrusion I&#xD;
wandered around the room in a listless way, a little&#xD;
softened by~ the loneliness of the once gay household.&#xD;
Old memories came creeping to me, as I sat, down,&#xD;
at lasting the firelight; little speeches, isolated sen-&#xD;
tences, pleasant meetings, tearful partings, quiet&#xD;
evenings, an4 dashing parties; little things, but full&#xD;
of meaning to me. Round school-girl faces, even now,&#xD;
some of them elongated to suit the dignity of mar4ed&#xD;
life; some dead, all scattered! What hopeful projects&#xD;
we had planned, wha~t blushing tales confessed, sit-&#xD;
ting around that now lonely fireplace! .They soften-&#xD;
ed me, hardened as I had 'made myself since then, and&#xD;
finally, yielding to their influence, I knelt down in&#xD;
the red, light, sighing my requiem over my lost&#xD;
girlhood.&#xD;
A step at the door startled me. I arose~ quickly,&#xD;
and advanced to meet my visitor. It was rGUb~i't,&#xD;

just out of the rain and 4ark; I could not help 'a little&#xD;
start of surprise.&#xD;
"I felt as if I should d6 something desperate if I&#xD;
stayed at home another day,'? he said, l~alf answering&#xD;
that. stai~t. "These rains are stupid. I find I cannot&#xD;
see Mr. Vane 'quite yet?"&#xD;
"2N'o," I said, '"he has laid us under orders not to*&#xD;
venture near him for two hours to come."&#xD;
He took the' chair I offered hhn, and leaned cheer-&#xD;
fully toward the fire. He had made us but few calls&#xD;
since the summer and Kate had left us, but it had&#xD;
made no difference in his manner, which was still that&#xD;
'of an old friend and favored guest, only that now he&#xD;
seemed to avoid the large chair always placed near&#xD;
my little work table, which had formerly been his&#xD;
usual seat.&#xD;
He would not let me light the' gas, preferring the&#xD;
softened light from the hail, he said, and said with the&#xD;
same apparent confidence in my consent with which&#xD;
he would have made the request a year before.' I&#xD;
would have resisted, but he turned his eyes undaunt-&#xD;
edly toward me, with manlike consciousness of&#xD;
power, scattering my frail defenses like chaff before&#xD;
the wind, and I yielded with' what grace 'I could, and&#xD;
essaying a half indifferent, careless glance, I took my&#xD;
usual seat bythe table; 'but under his fearless eyes,'&#xD;
though I brought all my strength to aid me in the&#xD;
contest, mine wavered and fell.&#xD;
&#xD;
I could not help itI struggled hard, but his eyes&#xD;
could have led me through fire and death,. with but&#xD;
half the mingled emotions that were in them then.&#xD;
What if the past six months could be blott I out, aud&#xD;
the old times back again! Could I be deenived; in&#xD;
spite of all did he not love me, had he not always'&#xD;
loved me? What right then had any other to come&#xD;
between us?&#xD;
I heard his voice, some every-day words, but it&#xD;
was a reason to meet his eyes again, and for the burn.&#xD;
ing blush and quick-dropping eyes to own him cou~&#xD;
queror. He knew enough not to proclaim his victory&#xD;
too soon, not until he had played the vanquished. I&#xD;
could not help it. What, if years or oceans had&#xD;
separated us, could~ I refuse, meeting, to those ' dear&#xD;
eyes? By and by he came to his old place, and'soon,.&#xD;
my work basket came under contribution for his&#xD;
amusement, as of old; it did my heart good, though&#xD;
I made a great show of opposition, to see him clipping&#xD;
my thread, entangling my silks, twisting my ribbons,&#xD;
and notching my spools, as he had done so often in&#xD;
the olden time. I lost not a word he said, not a&#xD;
sound of his voice; there was no power within me to&#xD;
remember that miniature, which he, too, seemed~ to&#xD;
have forgotten.    'S&#xD;
It seems to me I never sang as I did' that night,&#xD;
with that one listener, whenever praised, but only&#xD;
dreainily heard.&#xD;

on the piano stool.' "How can you care for any thing&#xD;
better than this?" glancing around the cozy room.&#xD;
"Because I want life, action, work. I should&#xD;
petrify here."&#xD;
"Do you call dancing, shopping, and having a&#xD;

"There is more than dancing, shopping, and&#xD;

"Are you not ashamed? You are only half a man&#xD;

"It's true, Georgie, I am only half a man, and my&#xD;
Aaziness is the key to my whole life. I can't get' out&#xD;
of old ways, I ~can't break through old customs.' I&#xD;
am not half what I ought to be. I feel all the time&#xD;
that if I would make one great effort, one firm wrench,&#xD;
and stand to it, I could do an immense deal; but the&#xD;
least show of resistance proves too much for me, and I&#xD;
give up rather than fight the battle."&#xD;
"Perhaps it wouldn't beso if you had any thing&#xD;

"I have something worth fighting for," he replied,&#xD;

"I think I am, Georgie, but I am going to get&#xD;

"No," I answered coldly, and left my seat.&#xD;
"Then I shall have to sing for you,". he said, gaily.&#xD;
"You are very kind," I returned with increased&#xD;

he said, after striking several' chords. "Will you not&#xD;

I did not hear any more for some time, and was&#xD;
half lost in reverie when a rich, deep voice, broke in,&#xD;
*or rather mingled with it, singing:&#xD;

I was getting him in earnest, I could see.&#xD;
"It is useless for me to beg pardon in detail," he&#xD;
said. "If I ever become wholly a man I will entreat&#xD;
it all at once."&#xD;
"With the full expectation of being forgiven!"&#xD;
"I expect nothing; ~I hope but little; I deserve&#xD;
your taunt, nevertheless."&#xD;
He turned slowly from me, irresolute, it seemed to&#xD;
me.&#xD;
I was angry enough for any thing then, and I call-&#xD;
ed him back.&#xD;
"You have more to say, say it."&#xD;
"I have more to say, but I cannot. Some time,&#xD;
perhaps, I shall be serious, earnest, and what I ought&#xD;
to be, now it makes no difference. I do not suppose&#xD;
~ou will believe me if I say I would not have offended&#xD;
you for the world."&#xD;
I hesitated. a moment.&#xD;
"You remember what yeu told me one night, last&#xD;
summer. Did I understand you rightly?"&#xD;
He bowed.&#xD;
"It is the same now?"&#xD;
He bowed again.&#xD;
"And yet you would have me believe you have a&#xD;
grain of truth in you!"&#xD;
That was enough; if he had forgotten it for that&#xD;
hour, it was only to make him remember it ever after~&#xD;
wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
The bright light in the hall shone full on a face&#xD;
that was pale and full of sadness, as he lingeringly&#xD;
prepared to leave.&#xD;
"Good night, Miss Vane," he said looking into the&#xD;
room, but not at me.&#xD;
"Oood night, Mr. Stuart."&#xD;
I could not realize even when the door closed be-&#xD;
hind him that he would not come back, and explain&#xD;
all this mystery, and win the forgiveness that was&#xD;
only for a moment out of his reach. It was harder&#xD;
still to think, after so many years of trust and faith,&#xD;
trust and faith that had not died in all the past&#xD;
month~, that faith and trust had been met, not only.&#xD;
with indifference but with insults. Even yet, such is&#xD;
woman's folly, with all my pride I could find excuse&#xD;
even for that, could believe he meant more than he&#xD;
could say.&#xD;
The next day I was to leave; I had seen the last&#xD;
of him, and hope was over.&#xD;
And then-Kate!&#xD;
Did I, therefore, tear him out of my heart? Did I&#xD;
blush that I had ever yielded him a moment's~ thought?&#xD;
Did I place hatred and contempt in the place where&#xD;
he once had reigned?&#xD;
I was no strong-minded heroine. I was a strong&#xD;
woman, perhaps, but strong only for others; the merest&#xD;
schoolgirl, crying over her first love, could shame me,&#xD;
weeping, de prqf'undis, over mine. I was no strong-&#xD;

listened for the echo of his footsteps splashing down the&#xD;
wet pavement; I found myself gradually leaning farther&#xD;
out, until the rain fell around me, and on me, listening&#xD;
still-holding my breath to hear that step once more.&#xD;
I went in, when I could ~o longer catch even its faint,&#xD;
far away sound, I went in to the now dull room, late-&#xD;
ly so brilliant with his presence. I stood by the chair&#xD;
in which he had sat, by the piano at which he had&#xD;
sung, with such earnestness and pathos, those strange&#xD;
words; longing to caress each object which had been&#xD;
blessed by his touch. I took my basket, just as he&#xD;
had left it, with its notched spools and twisted rib-&#xD;
bons, and locked it in the little black cabinet where I&#xD;
0&#xD;
kept my letters and journal. I sank down on the floor,&#xD;
with my head in his and there shrined my life's&#xD;
young dream in my heart, as a blessed memory, a&#xD;
glimpse of heaven before the celestial gates closed&#xD;
upon me; I buried him deep down in my heart, never&#xD;

which be praised my uncle's own immaculate hair~dye.&#xD;

flesh and gout on one side, and leanness and dyspepsia&#xD;
on the other; for the which be praised my uncle's en-&#xD;

Joined to these rare advantages of figure and whis.&#xD;

youthful eyes; a massive nose, of the New England&#xD;
type, which just intimated theke was a rough road,&#xD;

that it was not wonderful that in long parlors, and in&#xD;

*     ing eondition-was the object of admiring eyes innu-&#xD;
merable.&#xD;
As for me, though I had none of these latter claims&#xD;
upon society, there was,, still a prospect of something&#xD;
from my uncle, the good world thought. There was,&#xD;
too, a lingering remembrance of a brilliant heiress&#xD;
who had flitted across the sky of society, meteor-like,&#xD;
about whom there had been a story, deepened into&#xD;
mystery as years glided onward and saVr no more of&#xD;
her, until a daughter came to revive her image, and,&#xD;
thanks to a wealthy uncle, to raise it above the slan-&#xD;
derous tongue of envious society. A little mystery is&#xD;
piquante sometimes.&#xD;
I ai~ not writing my uncle's biography, or I should&#xD;
dwell half with amusement, half in disgust, on the~&#xD;
many incipient courtships of my tender-hearted uncle,&#xD;
during that gay winter. Incipient courtships, for it&#xD;
was not in the power of my generous uncle to confine&#xD;
himself for more than a few evenings to any one pret-&#xD;
ty face;~ it never had been, hence his bachelorship.&#xD;
"lown it,"he would say; "what then? Must a&#xD;
man make himself a boor for the sake of consistency,&#xD;
*    when his fickleness makes him only the more interest-&#xD;
ing to' others, and agreeable to himself?"&#xD;
Just here, in speaking of my uncle, I am remind-&#xD;
ed-I ca~i hardly say why-.of a dear and honored&#xD;
friend, whoonce said to me, speaking of a in~itixal ac-&#xD;
*quaintan~e, "Do you know' the secret of G.'s worldly&#xD;
&#xD;
prosperity? I will tell you: When he. was about&#xD;
starting on his worldly career he came to me for ad-&#xD;
vice. 'My dear young friend,' I said to him, 'lifb and&#xD;
your profession are not all made of roses, as you will&#xD;
too soon find. When adversity presses. hard upon&#xD;
you; when every thing is dark as midnight, without a&#xD;
glimmer of hope or comfort; when your friends look&#xD;
coldly upon you, and every thing, in fine, seems driv-&#xD;
ing you to despair; go then, expend, if need be, your&#xD;
last dollar, and buy a new pair of light-colored kid&#xD;
gloves, and put them on."' Therein is a world of&#xD;
meaning associated always in my mind, spite of the&#xD;
New England nose, with my uncle Tom.&#xD;
And .we two lived in the same house, eat at the same&#xD;
table, walked arm-in-arm, sat side by side, read th~ same&#xD;
books, and lived our sep Vate lives! So goesthe world!&#xD;
I cannot understand I those who say thalj sorrow or&#xD;
disappointment, such as mine, embitters the mind, and&#xD;
sours it to the World. The power I had for loving;&#xD;
sent back upon my heart, ran no longer in its deep&#xD;
but narrow channel; it diffused itself over my whole&#xD;
nature, becoming* weaker, perhaps, by the diffusion,&#xD;
mingling, as it did,' with my lighter, less noble, every-&#xD;
day character; but it made it kinder, more charitable,&#xD;
more generous to all I met. I did not hope that those&#xD;
loving tides could ever be gathered together and .~e&#xD;
cured in their old sweet, unseen bounds. So I lived&#xD;
for society as best I could.&#xD;

&#xD;
Feel kindly, friendly to humanity, and humanity&#xD;
rewards you by its efforts to appreciate and become&#xD;
worthy of your regard It is only the selfish, the use-&#xD;
less, or the wicked that declaim against the injustice&#xD;
of mankind. Just it seldom is, for humanity is human;&#xD;
but it does. its best, and the true man tries in other ways&#xD;
than angry remonstrance to make that best better.&#xD;
So I gathered to myself many a heart-offering from&#xD;
those who surrounded me, and strove here and there&#xD;
to say a word or two that might fall in the right place.&#xD;
I, a woman, honor women. I know they are vain,&#xD;
frivolous, extravagant, and capricious, with a tho~isand&#xD;
faults beside; but I honor 'them still. I say nothing&#xD;
of the false state of society, the folly and blindness of&#xD;
parents, the flattery of friends, that make them what&#xD;
they are9. Would you have me dash my head against&#xD;
a wall? From' now until the day of judgment, I veri-&#xD;
ly believe young girls, fresh and sweet, and pure and&#xD;
lovely, with the dew of heaven on their lips, and the&#xD;
music of angels in their voices; with holy inspirations,&#xD;
saintly virtues, heavenly dreams, and martyr endur-.&#xD;
ance sleeping in their breasts, waiting the time for&#xD;
woman's work to nee'd them, will be led like lambs to&#xD;
the slaughter, after systemized hoarding-schools and&#xD;
ec~ntentious ~homes have labored day and night, by&#xD;
open blows and concealed undermining, by every&#xD;
power known to' unau or woman, by appeals to every&#xD;
w&amp;amp;mau-fault and woman-enemy, to deaden and destroy&#xD;
&#xD;
that heaven-born nature"before its first sweet slumbers&#xD;
are broken. We may write books, we may preach&#xD;
sermons, we may deliver lectures, we may call con-&#xD;
ventions and establish associations, we may found&#xD;
nunneries, and our reward will be only ridicule, and&#xD;
fruitless labor for the world will go on just as before,&#xD;
anSI woman will dance, and sing, and make merry, for&#xD;
a brief season, before she resigns her throne for the&#xD;
nursery; because, maimed and crippled, spiritually&#xD;
and physically, she has not found thai~ both can be*&#xD;
held at once. From the patient endurance, the tender-&#xD;
ness, the unselfishness, and the strength for which&#xD;
women fight, and which they so rarely. lose, through&#xD;
all the power an~fL skill of the world, what may we not&#xD;
hope?&#xD;
I honor them still, these very girls-light, vain,&#xD;
and capricious-who rattle nonsense till your head&#xD;
aches, and imagine they are clever; these very girls&#xD;
who would measure Tennyson by the cut of his coat,&#xD;
and Browning by the style of his whiskers, who count&#xD;
men and women by their dollars, rather than by their&#xD;
virtues, these very girls, aimless, missionless as they&#xD;
seem, are panting every one of them, like tired chib&#xD;
dren, for the lost path. One of these, delicate, pain-&#xD;
pered, idle,~luxurious as they are, will stand by your&#xD;

be enough grateful to him; a few sweet words, a&#xD;
* loving smile, a caress more tender than usual, is her&#xD;
utmost reward. One of these, weak, silly, thought-&#xD;
less as they are, will find you a way through the&#xD;
labyrinth of cares and fears, in which your last friend&#xD;
has lefl~ you, hopelessly ensnared. One of these-what&#xD;
use is there to talk-neglected, misled, misunderstood-&#xD;
there is something pure and good, and strong in the&#xD;
worst of them all. I honor them still, I long to take&#xD;
them in my arms and say: "Oh, you frail little&#xD;
creatures, wandering, like lost children, on false paths,&#xD;
what n4~hty ways you might tread! How beautiful,&#xD;
how great, how lovable you might be, if you would&#xD;
strive not alone for the path of beauty, but of strength&#xD;
and goodness; if you would only follow the divine&#xD;
light not yet, never extinguished in your souls, and&#xD;
make~it a halo for home and ~orthe world, a fireside&#xD;
glow, and a beacon light!"&#xD;
False, but so unconsciously false to themselves. I&#xD;
love and honor my sex; and when I see one bright, and&#xD;
sweet, and good, with a warm heart, and cordial hand,&#xD;
cherished at home, honored abroad, bringing sweet&#xD;
homeways into society, and grateful social charms&#xD;
into the home circle, then indeed have my eyes beheld&#xD;
~t lovely sight.&#xD;
And in this spirit I took my place among them,&#xD;
~nd tog~tlier we danced through one gay winter in&#xD;
New York, while my uncle grew younger and gayer&#xD;
&#xD;
every day, and was, perhaps, less glad than I when&#xD;
fashion decreed that we should leave the dusty city&#xD;
for summer's sweetest home.&#xD;
Yet I did not like the prospect of another summer&#xD;
in L-. I scarcely knew why, and my uncle read-&#xD;
ing my half-formed thought proposed a tour through&#xD;
the East, finishing, as in duty bound, at Saratoga,&#xD;
where every thing was as it always is ; crowded hotels,&#xD;
brimming over with flirts and fortune hunters, and for&#xD;
the rest neither interesting nor picturesque in any&#xD;
degree~&#xD;

THERR comes a time in nearly every woman's life,&#xD;
I believe, when she is like one waiting. She is not&#xD;
married, perhaps she does not care to be; she has no&#xD;
especial Work, perhaps she does not desire to have;&#xD;
she has no particular ambition or object in life, perhaps&#xD;
does not know where to seek one. It is a trying&#xD;
time; society is all in all to her no longer. She is too&#xD;
unsettled~ to study, not knowing the need, and any&#xD;
straw in the balance may turn her fate. Great mis-&#xD;
fortune, some unexpected~change, may rouse her and&#xD;
decide her for immense good, or monotony may! con-&#xD;
quer, and she turns to a listless routine, from which&#xD;
the chances are few that she will ever move.&#xD;
Such a time liad come to me, and I faced it, for I&#xD;

destiny, or a placid existence n~iade up. of books, music,&#xD;

ly made myself notorious, and was terribly imposed&#xD;
upon. I tried a "Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement&#xD;

embroidery patterns and fashion plates, and' as I&#xD;
would not lose my esteem for the minds of my friends,&#xD;
I withdrew, and the whole thing fell to the ground.&#xD;
I tried teaching, and adored it, but I had never known&#xD;
confinement and my health gave way-I was not&#xD;
sorry. What right had I, with a happy home, to take&#xD;

parently listening. Uncle Tom was in some manner&#xD;
drawn aside, and as I stood waiting for his .retui'n,&#xD;
some Words of seemingly eager discussion caught my&#xD;
ear. Presentlyone voice, deep and impassioned, fixed&#xD;
my attention.&#xD;
"A little more of this indecision," were the first&#xD;
words I 'heard, "and the work is lost! A. little more&#xD;
ease, a little more~ pleasure, and every thing will be&#xD;
gone! Is there no strength, no energy left us? Is it&#xD;
a few words here, a vote or two there, that is to work&#xD;
out our salvation? Is it now and then a man, earnest&#xD;
and willing to labor, that is to do the work?"&#xD;
There was a mingling of voices, and I heard no&#xD;
more; but something in the voice I had heard haunted&#xD;
me. I really hungered for it ~as I wandered around&#xD;
the building. I have heard stray notes of music,&#xD;
passing' tones that have 'lingered with me in the&#xD;
same way, but this was intensified, and so real that I&#xD;
gladly saw my uncle depait, leaving me, with many&#xD;
remonstrances, behind. I eared not for the words, I&#xD;
would not even look at the speaker, but I would go&#xD;
back and hear its music again. I was standing near&#xD;
a large window, the crowd Was whirling by beneath,&#xD;
rattling, thundering by, but it did not prevent my&#xD;
hearing and distinguishing the voice that had beguiled&#xD;
my fancy from all the rest. They were pTassing me on&#xD;
their way out of the house; I turned slightly toward&#xD;
&#xD;
them, the speaker was leaving them. I turned ~back&#xD;
- to the window just as you do when~a sweet song is&#xD;
ended. Some one stood beside me. I turned, and a&#xD;
pair of eyes, so blue, so bright, so glad, so tender,&#xD;
looked into mine, that I received their gaze as if all&#xD;
were a dream. ~ So blue, so bright, so glad, so tended',&#xD;
that I can never forget that moment's meeting.&#xD;
"Am I forgotten? Am I to be introduced, and be-.&#xD;
gin all over again?" It was the voice I had heard, and&#xD;
though 1~he tone was apparently light, there was a deep-&#xD;

same voice, and the speaker was Carlton Aberthnay.&#xD;
"Forgotten?" I repeated dreamily. "No, I have a&#xD;
vague, indefinite idea of having met you somewhere&#xD;
before-in some other world, perhaps. It seems a life-&#xD;
time since, but it will serve for an introduction."&#xD;
"Take my ~ he answered, or rather asked,~&#xD;
"and let us bring up the books for that lifetime; for a&#xD;
new lifetime begins now!" This last half spoken,&#xD;
half murmured, wholly exultant.&#xD;
So arm in arm we paced up and do*n the long&#xD;
rooms, and in his rich voice, his radiant beauty, in his&#xD;
joyous words I found such pleasure as I had not&#xD;
known for many ~ day.&#xD;
"Ah, I have been roving around everywhere," be&#xD;
said, answering my inquiries. "It seems rather ab-&#xD;

almost a live existence these two years past. It is&#xD;
quite promising, I assure you! But do tell me* by&#xD;
what strange chance Mi~ Vane was ever induced to&#xD;
put his foot into this city of abominations; has he&#xD;
gone into pQlitics?"&#xD;
I laughed for answer.&#xD;
"0, he scorns them," he said, intei'preting my&#xD;
laugh. "Don't let him grumble, then, if things don't&#xD;
-x go to suit him. It'8 a burning shame, the indifference&#xD;
with which Northern men let the 'vulgar crowd' set~.&#xD;
tle all affairs of state. Why, after a little it will be&#xD;
highly disreputable for a respectable man to hold a&#xD;
government office, which will be bad for us."&#xD;
"Government rolls along comfortably enough," I&#xD;
answered. "I can't blame men like uncle Tom for be-&#xD;
ing unwilling to worry about its incoming and out~&#xD;
goings so long as it comes and goes as prosaically as&#xD;
at present. But don't let us waste our precious time&#xD;
upon subjects so unworthy. I am more than disgusted&#xD;
with Washington already."&#xD;
"And how is every body in L-.?" and so on,&#xD;
* gossip, small talk about works, paintings, music, men,&#xD;
and women, now and then something a little graver;&#xD;
so our talk ran, until my uncle Tom returned' for' me,&#xD;
and as Mr. Aberthnay was of old an exceeding great&#xD;
*   favorite with my uncle, he lacked not the most cordial&#xD;
invitations to become almost domesticated with us,&#xD;
invitations which were most quickly accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
As I thought now, sometimes, of the days when I&#xD;
had looked upon Mr. Abertlinay as a lover, it seemed&#xD;
as if they were days in a dream. No word, no look&#xD;
that could bring back that time ever fell from him to&#xD;
startle me; and enlivened by his ever-animated spirits,&#xD;
interested in his plans, as no one who heard him talk&#xD;
could help being, I soon found myself yielding to the&#xD;
magnetism of his cheerful influence, and counted every&#xD;
party dull of which he did not make.a part. No wo-&#xD;
man will believe me if I say I saw with pleasure that&#xD;
he had overcome his boyish fancy for me; no one will&#xD;
believe me if I say I saw, with unmixed satisfaction,&#xD;
that however much we were together the old feeling&#xD;
gave no sign of reviving. We tell these men to for-.&#xD;
get as a matter of duty, but we are not expected to&#xD;
see, without a little surprise or mortified vanity, how&#xD;
readily they obey us.&#xD;
He was called. my lover everywhere: there are&#xD;
few greater annoyances than this of having one's name&#xD;
always coupled with that of one who is more than&#xD;
friend, and less than lover; to whom the world will&#xD;
positively engage you, or absolutely demand that you&#xD;
shall count 'him not even an acquaintance.&#xD;
He was not~ my lover, yet I knew he had a revpr-&#xD;
ence for me that I had never seen him yield to any&#xD;
other. I knew he recognized me at n~iy best, with a&#xD;
tender, protecting, manly forgiveness for all my&#xD;
weaknesses. I knew if he did love me, he would love&#xD;

conscious~of his manhood can so love-as if mine not his&#xD;
were the greater soul; an unhappylove for both man and&#xD;
woman, for itis her sweet right to lose herbeing in his.&#xD;
One day, it was the last before I was to leave for&#xD;
our summer home, there had been a meeting of infiw&#xD;
ential men, apparently for. social enjoyment, but really&#xD;
for graver purposes. My uncle and Mr. Aberthnay&#xD;
had gone, and I was alone nearly all day. It was a&#xD;
restless day, warm before one is ready for warmth, a&#xD;
d~y with summer's languor without summer's beauty,&#xD;
a day in which one's life~hardly seems worth fighting&#xD;
for. That day, at twilight, after the meeting, Carl-&#xD;
ton ~Aberthnay, with a-rush of wor~1s wbich I could not&#xD;
* stay, told me that he still loved me-not timidly, al-&#xD;
moat hopelessly, as of old, but powerfully, determined-&#xD;
ly, '~4th a love that would never cease. Gently he told&#xD;
me, but terribly.&#xD;
I. could but beg him to hush, to spare. me.,&#xD;
"Spare you, Georgie? Is it so dreadful to love&#xD;
and to kiiow it? One word-"&#xD;
"No, no, I cannot say it." I moaned, thinking of&#xD;
his pain, and the wrong I. had done him in letting this&#xD;
thing go on.&#xD;
He saw, at last, my heart was not for him; and&#xD;
*w~ien he, saw there was pain beyond any maiden coy-&#xD;
ness,~ he stayed bis words of entreaty; asking me only&#xD;
to t~U him why it pained me so.&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
* "Because," I ~answered,' "because ~ ~ould have&#xD;
known this; I should have been strong i~gh to de-&#xD;
prive myself; for your sake, of the soet ,that has&#xD;
been so pleasant to me."               -&#xD;
"Do you imagine you, could have done any thing&#xD;
to change me? You could, indeed, have. taken away&#xD;
the joy of being with you, but you could have taken&#xD;
away none of the love wherewith I have loved you&#xD;
from the first, and will love you as long as I live in&#xD;
this world, and, if God so permits, in the next."&#xD;
"I must not listen to you," I said. "I am inca-&#xD;
pable of loving any one, and it is not right that I&#xD;
should hear such noble words. U have done you&#xD;
Wicked, bitter wrong; you should do nothing but&#xD;
hate me."&#xD;
"I can do nothing but love you, Georgie," he said,&#xD;
"but love, you and reverence you all the days of my&#xD;
life. Not incapable of loving! do not say that, but not&#xD;
loving because there is no one worthy of your great&#xD;
heart. I, least of all; I have never for one moment&#xD;
dreamed myself worthy, but I did dare to think x~iy&#xD;
love for you might make me less unworthy. I have&#xD;
tried to think if I knew one better than I who loved&#xD;
you, could, I stand by and let him take what I dared&#xD;
not hope to win, and I knew I could not do it; I must&#xD;
seek you, you only. But do not look so frightened.&#xD;
I love you, I seek you, I wait for you, but I shall not&#xD;

Had he said more .1 could have i'esisted better; but&#xD;
my own- reproaches, his resolutely-suppressed words,~&#xD;
his gentle forbearance to probe my wound, were al-&#xD;
most more than I could bear.&#xD;
Soon I spoke more plainly, telling him, not that I&#xD;
had loved any other, for I had persuaded myself that&#xD;
I had not; but that deepest, firmest friendship, was all&#xD;
I could ever give him, or indeed any one. Then he&#xD;
plead for that in exchange for the love he offered me,&#xD;
and I' strove with him for himself against himself, ipi-&#xD;
plored him not to let me weakly consent to do him&#xD;
this terrible wrong. But my words no longer availed;&#xD;
and so, at last, wearied with the day's languor, and&#xD;
listening to the voice that pleaded so sweetly, be~&#xD;
living I could make him a true and trusty, if not a&#xD;
fond and loving ~vife, I choked down the expostula-&#xD;
tions of my conscience, and the forebodings of my&#xD;
heart, and became Carlton Aberthnay's promised&#xD;
* wife."&#xD;
"Not promised," he said; "nothing more shall you&#xD;
promise me than that I may love you, may be near&#xD;
you, may live in the light of your presence. I will not&#xD;
do you the wrong to take a promise so urgently en.&#xD;
treated, so almost forced from you. But I will love&#xD;

day as your heart turns against me; and then, dearest&#xD;
Georgie, do not hesitate to send me away."&#xD;
"I shall never send you away," I answered; "so long&#xD;
as you are satisfied with that which I told you is yours,&#xD;
has long been yours, so long shall I, too be yours."&#xD;
The duty was less wearisome than I 'had feared;&#xD;
I ground down my conscience, and at last it ceased to&#xD;
reproach me; I began to forget that I did not love&#xD;
Carl, and to live willingly, eagerly even, in his love,&#xD;
his ardent, unselfish love.&#xD;
Time went by lightly enough, when, sitting under&#xD;
our brave Massachusetts' elms, I poured out all my&#xD;
thoughts to him as I had never done to any other.&#xD;
Often and often had I longed f6r this; a manly mind&#xD;
in communion with my own, not for love, but cultiva-&#xD;
tion. His letters were treasures of literary taste, and&#xD;
full of thoughtful interest~ apart even from the unva-&#xD;
i'ying devotion which was the undercurrent of every&#xD;
thought and expression. I lived in the varied- scenes&#xD;
through which ho passed; I felt that I knew those&#xD;
whom he met and cared for, and scarcely considered&#xD;
if the myriad fancies which clustered around our cor-&#xD;
respondence were mine or were his. But here it end-&#xD;
ed; mine was only an intellectual pleasure in writing;&#xD;
he, poor fellow! opened hi~ heart and showered its&#xD;
wealth of love on me, and received never a word of&#xD;
love in return, for I was scrupulously exact in all I&#xD;
gave, or seemed to give. With his native delicacy' ho&#xD;

made no complaint, although it must have pained him&#xD;
deeply. Once he wrote me, however: "Your letters&#xD;
are beautiful; were, they not even from you,. I think I&#xD;
could never tir&amp;amp; of reading them. They are really&#xD;
works of art, but works no more for me than they&#xD;
might be for any other."&#xD;
And again: "Among all these fresh, fragrant flow-&#xD;
ers of your funcy, what unutterable joy if there should&#xD;
be found one little heart blossom that had bloomed for&#xD;
me only; one leaf or bud. from your great wealth of&#xD;
suck to be worn ever in his heart whose life is in&#xD;
7~&#xD;
Still I did not realize the yearning which thus&#xD;
murmured to me. I lived in a cold, selfish mood,&#xD;
rather proud of the fervid, romantic way in which he&#xD;
loved me, never thinking love could be forced, how..&#xD;
ever gently; never questioning to which my heart&#xD;
were best given, never straining to the higher soul,&#xD;
the knightly s9ul that loved me, "not Lancelot nor&#xD;
an~her." I was startled into momentary warmth&#xD;
only when I was obliged to feel that no man~s love&#xD;
can be long preserved without some slight hope of re-&#xD;
turn; clinging to Carlton as my all in the world, this&#xD;
thought always frightened me. But I kept even that&#xD;
passing glow out of my letters. I meant to be just to&#xD;
him, and never to deceive him, never ,to feign what.I&#xD;
did not feel. It did not occur to me to feel what I&#xD;
would not feign.&#xD;

THERE were gay times when "Miss Georgie's"&#xD;

Kate in a silk ~o stiff that her every motion made my&#xD;

Of course, she had known all about it all along; she&#xD;
always knew I liked him; she had said to Mrs. Glynn,&#xD;
"Just you take my word for it, Mr. Aberthnay's the&#xD;

wedding dress would be a beauty. And then to think&#xD;
how many would be jealous, and what Mrs. Graham&#xD;
would say who had tried so hard to get Mr. Aberthnay&#xD;

Mr~ Abertlinay had resigned his position upon my&#xD;

cards were ordered.&#xD;
I went down to L- for a ~w days before the.&#xD;
time, while Kate, who was to 'be my first bridesmaid,&#xD;
kept house for my uncle in New York. Kate might&#xD;
well congratulate me on my marriage, for she was to&#xD;
take my place, a snug one enough, in my uncle's&#xD;
homestead, as she had already taken my place else-&#xD;
where. No, not that; she could never fill my place in&#xD;
either capacity. It rained nearly all the time I was&#xD;
there,. ;dulI, dreary November storms; I was glad&#xD;
enough to leave the old house that would never see&#xD;
Georgie Vane again. Mrs. Glynn, the housekeeper,&#xD;
would not let a thing be taken from my room; it must&#xD;
always look just so, she said, to welcome me when I&#xD;
came home for my visits. We went all over the house&#xD;
together, I giving her some little memento for each of~&#xD;
the servants, until we came, at last, bonneted and cloak-&#xD;
ed to the 'hail, when she said: "Please, Miss Georgie,&#xD;
you've been so good, you've remembered all-even poor&#xD;
Christy-there's one who you might remember."&#xD;
4&#xD;
"Whom?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Stuart, Miss Georgie."&#xD;
Turning toward her angrily, I answered: "I have&#xD;
nothing for him."&#xD;
"Oh! any thing, Miss Georgie, that I could give&#xD;
him some time; I needn't say you told me, Miss."&#xD;
My eyes fell wistfully on the little black cabinet, I&#xD;
even put the key in to open it, but I remembered.&#xD;
"No, Mrs. Glynn," I said, rising and' speaking reso-&#xD;
lutely, "I am going to marry Mr. Aberthnay, I must&#xD;
not think of any one else. But here," I added, taking&#xD;
off a ring that Mr. Stuart had won at a Fair, years and&#xD;
years before, and given to me, ~" give this to Miss Kate&#xD;
on her wedding-day. Tell her Mr. Stuart gave it to&#xD;
me." Sh~ took it wonderingly.&#xD;
"But Mr. Stuart-" she urged.&#xD;
"Ihate him I" I answered, stung by her persever-&#xD;
ance. "I hate the very sound of his name!" She&#xD;
sprang toward me, holding her hand before my&#xD;
mouth, a freedom which startled me more than words&#xD;
or shrieks could have done. r' saw that she turned&#xD;
her eyes toward the parlor door. I had not time to&#xD;
ask her what it meant, before a pale face passed be-&#xD;
tween me and the light.&#xD;
"I did not intend to hear-" he began, then paused.&#xD;
"You are quite right, Miss Vane; I did not know you&#xD;
were going so soon. I hoped to have made you a call&#xD;
earlier, but was detained. Shall I see you to your&#xD;

"Please don't be angry with me," she said half&#xD;
crying, "I always fancied y~ou had a liking for each&#xD;
other, and I thought may be at the last minute it&#xD;
would come round; so when he came past the house&#xD;

"Life isn't a novel, Mrs. Glynn, and I hope you are&#xD;
convinced now that Mr. Stuart and I d~ not care for&#xD;

"Yes, Miss, now I know, but I didn't used to think&#xD;
it would come out so."&#xD;
"You see he does not care for me," was all Icould&#xD;
say.&#xD;

A~erthnay met me at the depot, as glad to see me,&#xD;
both, as ff1 had been gone a year. My trousseau was&#xD;
almost finished; Mrs. Giddings had sent for more lace&#xD;
for my dress, and Mrs. Varney~ said my wreath would&#xD;
be superb-this was Kate's greeting, of course.&#xD;
I had a grand wedding; my uncle looked upon it&#xD;
as the climax* of his life, he wouldn't have had any&#xD;
thing wanting that money or labor could get, for the&#xD;
world. He and Kate seemed to feel very much more&#xD;
excited about it than we who were the most concerned;&#xD;
indeed, Kate seemed ever on the point of thanking me&#xD;
for my kindness in getting married, as ff1 had done it&#xD;
all on purpose for the gratification she found in fixing&#xD;
and fussing for it.&#xD;
I do not know of what other people think when&#xD;
they are about being marriQd, I know I thought&#xD;
more connectedly of the fitting of my dress, the trail-&#xD;
ing of the skirts, the killing of my veil, than any thing&#xD;
else; and 1 am sure if Mr. Aberthnay had told me the&#xD;
truth about his, it would have been of the ugliness of&#xD;
a modern man's "wedding garments."&#xD;
At last I was dressed, and left alone, haunted by&#xD;
an undefined dread, nervous and restless.&#xD;
But when I heard Mr. Aberthnay's eager step on&#xD;

"Oh, Carl," I said, with more warmth than I had&#xD;

"Wrong! oh, Georg~e! Can you call that wrong&#xD;

N&#xD;
even, to look upon you with less than unutterable&#xD;
gratitude and adoration? Trust me, Georgie, my love&#xD;
is warm and great enough to shelter you forever.&#xD;
Every day it must increase, for every day, 'already, I&#xD;
love you more than before. Come to me, then, fear-&#xD;

"You will tire of that, Carl; and how, then, can I&#xD;
keep you--I, who am so cold, so undemonstrative?&#xD;
Oh, no, Carl, it must not be. I cannot return you any&#xD;

"It wishes no return, dearest Georgie, save your&#xD;
own free return. Is it not of itself happiness beyond&#xD;
words to be with you always, and to love you al~&#xD;

"Always!" I repeated, clinging to him, whose&#xD;

"Fear not," he said, fondly; "when the blessed&#xD;
words are spoken, God will turn your heart to me, and&#xD;
we shall be forever happy.~~&#xD;
My conscience 'wag not satisfied, my fears were not&#xD;

longed for it, trembled to lose it, and yet felt my own&#xD;
unworthiness. I felt old in the ways of the heart,&#xD;

This was enough; I shrink from danger or grief!&#xD;
I fear to breast life's angriest wave' by my husband's&#xD;
side! If there were storms ahead, then well' for him&#xD;
to have the one he loved by him. "Danger or sorrow&#xD;

&#xD;
IT was hard to see my poor Uncle Tom breaking&#xD;
down at the last, and pushing me into the carriage&#xD;
with something between a blessing and a jest; harder&#xD;
still to hear Kate's violent professions of sorrow and&#xD;
affection; but I forbore resistance, letting her have it&#xD;
her own way, wondering if she fancied I could be so&#xD;
easily deceived. All the partings came to an end, at&#xD;
last, and Carl and I departed.&#xD;
We went down to the plantation, and lived hap-&#xD;
pily as might be. More loVing and more tender bride-&#xD;
groom could not be. Every luxury that the most&#xD;
boundless devotion could devise was lavished upon me&#xD;
by him, who, though' my husband, was still my lover.&#xD;
There were all the' novelties of Southern institu-&#xD;
tions to interest me,-the freedom of Southern life to&#xD;
employ my energy, curiosity, and love of scenery;&#xD;
while each particular negro seemed a "character" to&#xD;
my unaccustomed eyes.&#xD;
Nothing ~at first struck me more forcibly than the&#xD;

* wonderful capacity ~of the negroes for enjoyment.&#xD;
notwithstandingg their hard-working, aimless lives, so&#xD;
burdensome as to seem calculated to deaden every&#xD;
spark of spirit within them, they- entered with the zest&#xD;
of children let loose from school into all the festivities&#xD;
designed to celebrate their master's marriage. Never&#xD;
shall I forget my first sensations as their dark faces&#xD;
suddenly appeared before me, intent, no* doubt, on no&#xD;
thought but a fair lo~k at the new "missus," but&#xD;
seeming to me ominous of shadows and clouds in my&#xD;
new home.&#xD;
I could not enjoy their hilarity; it was to my views&#xD;
so forced, so soulless, and unnaturaL All shams were&#xD;
and are alike to me; no clown ever aroused my laugh-&#xD;
ter,-no circus antics ever gave me any feeling but of&#xD;
pain for the performers; and so now I breathed freer&#xD;
when there came an end. to the "festivities," that is,&#xD;
the well-arranged farce, in which the expert manager&#xD;
exhibits his sable troupe for the especial edifiqation of&#xD;
benighted Northerners visiting the sunny South, who&#xD;
seeing, return and write ponderous volumes about the&#xD;
gay and affectionate negro, as seen in the charming&#xD;
light of the patriarchal system. We know better.&#xD;
They are a sensitive race, these poor black slaves,&#xD;
quick to see through your actions and your motives,&#xD;
through your mask to your heart; and although I&#xD;
treated them with uniform consideration, never over-&#xD;
working them, never letting them suffer for any care&#xD;

never even. raising my voice in sternness to them, I&#xD;
found they loved me not half as well as they would&#xD;

with a vehemence -which would shame our sharpest&#xD;

upon the floor, muttering now and then a bitter oath&#xD;

went down to them and spoke to them as one woman&#xD;

to many a fair white lady in her beauty and wealth.&#xD;
"Carl," I said, one night', "you must not have&#xD;
women work on the plantation. It is cruel."&#xD;
"They' only work when we are pressed, and are&#xD;
worth as much as the men."&#xD;
"It is not a question of their worth, but of your&#xD;
humanity."&#xD;
"Nonsense, Georgie; you must get these Yankee&#xD;
ideas out of your head, or they will make you trouble.&#xD;
Nobody on my plantation has much to complain of.&#xD;
Grin~s says the rascals are as fat and lazy as the day&#xD;

slave I have tell you there is no easier master than&#xD;
theirs for miles and miles around?"&#xD;
"But it is not other men's actions that you should&#xD;
take as a standard, but your own sense of right. It is&#xD;

"Forever down upon poor Grimes! Why, Georgie,&#xD;

"You shall not turn me away,," I answered; "I&#xD;
am not going to be put off with pretty speeches; I am&#xD;
'in earnest, speaking from my heart."&#xD;
"Well, Georgie, I do not doubt that many things&#xD;
strike you, a stranger to our ways, as rather hard,&#xD;
more especially as just now we are in such a state that&#xD;
we have to work things harder than ever before; but&#xD;
when you know us better, you will see that we do our&#xD;
best considering the circumstances. Fancy now that&#xD;
I should do as you ask me, and you know, Queen&#xD;
Georgie, there is nothing that you could ask that it is&#xD;
not happiness f'or me to do, if it is only in my power;&#xD;
fancy now that I should in* this, our busiest season,&#xD;
send away Mr. Grimes and release those few women,&#xD;
what WouId be the consequence? In place of the&#xD;
women for whom there is no other possible work, I&#xD;
should have to get some more men, which is a thing&#xD;
out of the question,-I cannot afford it. Next I should&#xD;
have to find a successor to Grimes, no easy matter,&#xD;
and all the* time spent in searching so much time lost;'&#xD;
the best I could get would, I am certain, be so much&#xD;
inferior to him, that half a dozen extra hands would&#xD;
not more than make up the difference. When times&#xD;
come better and things get easier, you will not. have to"&#xD;
a~k this twice; but now it will not do, Grimes is a&#xD;
good fellow; ~he knows I would discharge him in an&#xD;
&#xD;
hour if lie was cruel to the hands; he is a thorough&#xD;
and a super manager; he takes a world of care off my,&#xD;
shoulders; so let u~ leave him to get things through in&#xD;

"But, Carl," I urged, "wha't do we want of so&#xD;
much money? Do you suppose I want useless fine&#xD;
things obtained by money coined out of the tears of&#xD;
my own sex..&#xD;
"If there's one thing that I hate more than an-&#xD;
other," interrupted my husband, "it is to hear you&#xD;
call those black beings of your sex. Let me implore&#xD;
you to spare me that pain. You, the very perfection&#xD;

'Coined out of tears,' you. say,-it will be coined out&#xD;
of better life-blood than that of black slaves one of&#xD;
these days. But not yet, perhaps never; do not think&#xD;
of it. Forgive me,. darling Georgie, if I seem unkind&#xD;
to you,-you, who are dearer than life itself; but, trust&#xD;
me, I am not hard-hearted, and what I can do for my&#xD;
* slaves I am glad to do; but to make any change, how-&#xD;
ever slight, in their condition, might endanger more&#xD;
than my property."&#xD;
"how so, Carl."&#xD;
"A certain set of men in the South, Georgie, in&#xD;
order to prevent the people from being disgusted with&#xD;
slavery, and to keep the South united in one interest,&#xD;
in order to further their own ends, social and political,&#xD;
have taken advantage of the Northern detestation of&#xD;
slavery, and the imprudent expressions of a certain&#xD;
set of fanatics at the North, to make our people jeal-&#xD;
ously, morbidly sensitive on the subject which is our&#xD;
perpetual bone of contention. Lately it has become&#xD;
imperative on us to be as one man,'-this, our common&#xD;
interest, is the tie that binds us in spite of all opposing&#xD;
thoughts and feelings; we have been worked up on the&#xD;
subject more assiduously than ever, and now it is not&#xD;
safe for. one to do a humane or Christian act toward&#xD;
his slaves,, especially if he is known, like me, to have&#xD;
a Northern education and a brave Northern wife;&#xD;
my smallest act would be magnified into an enormous&#xD;
abolition tendency, the crime of crimes down here."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I never dreamed of this, CarL I thought we&#xD;
lived in a free country.".&#xD;
"Not yet; but we shall make it so; the hour is&#xD;
almost at hand."&#xD;
"Carl,~ I do not wish to penetrate your secrets, but&#xD;
let me entreat you to ~beware lest your enthusiasm and&#xD;
love for your own section, may be used to make you a&#xD;
tool in the hands of ambitious and designing men."&#xD;
"A tool! Do I look like it? No, Georgie, wher-&#xD;
ever your husband goes he goes. as a leader, be sure of&#xD;
that. I do not go into any thing blindly; this is no&#xD;
new thing, we have been brought up to it, to work for&#xD;
'Southern rights.' You are amazed; you remember&#xD;
our 'conversation at your uncle's? I did not know&#xD;
then how much of reality there was in what I said.&#xD;
You laughed at me for a dreamer then-so would all&#xD;
your Northern friends; they have been too busy&#xD;
making money up North, to think what we were&#xD;
doing here; too much elated with their annual fleecing&#xD;
of the Southerners to see that we were not the easy&#xD;
- fools we seemed."'&#xD;
"Carl, you terrify me."&#xD;
"It is that which terrifies me. Oh! Georgie, if&#xD;
any thing should happen and you an exile from your&#xD;
early home, turned against this, and hating me, hating&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
DAYS came and went; dull days; little to do, lit-&#xD;
tle to see, little to read. I tried to interest myself in&#xD;
the new scenes around me, but, the summer gone,. my&#xD;
heart pined for the white fields of snow the ice-hung&#xD;
trees, and the clear, cold starlight of dear New Eng-&#xD;
land-ever dear, but never so dear as when, sitting in&#xD;
my own new home, my hands clasped so as to conceal&#xD;
the wedding-ring, memory brought back the rosy&#xD;
skaters, the merry sleigh-bells, and the shouts of the&#xD;
boys dashing down' the hills on their swift sleds, which&#xD;
had so often aroused my mirth at home; at home,-&#xD;
would any place ever seem like home to me again!&#xD;
Thinking of the old days when 'a bright, somewhat&#xD;
hoydenisli girl, I tramped through the snow to school,&#xD;
made snow men, or glided through labyrinthian snow-&#xD;
caves with a bright, red-oheeked boy,' my constant&#xD;
companion, torment, and champion,-thinking of this,&#xD;
how tame and aimless seemed my present life.!&#xD;

dearest, let the~ fierce March winds go by, and my&#xD;

And for that .1 seemed to live. I counted the days&#xD;
until the spring should be at . hand, and I could be&#xD;
once more in the arms of the old house.&#xD;
No change had come over my husband's ter~der~&#xD;
ness, b~it I was. far from being his sole engrossing&#xD;

know were being woven in my very house, which I,&#xD;
hands tied, could make no effort to sunder.&#xD;
A day or two before we wereto leave, it was not&#xD;
long after the Charleston Convention, my husband&#xD;
'brought some of its members home to dinner.&#xD;
"Do not invite any one," he said to .me; "let it be&#xD;
really en famit~e, and do try to keep that Grimes&#xD;
away. He has lately adopted a fashion of intruding&#xD;
his vulgar face whenever I have gen1~lemen here; I&#xD;
don't like it; and, Georgie "-this very wistfully-&#xD;
"Georgie, darling, it kills me to keep these things&#xD;
from you; I cannot deceive you, and we so much&#xD;
need your help, your quick observations, your tact,&#xD;
your ready woman's instinct; I want your brave&#xD;
heart and your noble soul to uphold and steady mine.&#xD;
But I have to shut up every thing in myself; away&#xD;
from you,-should it be so ?."&#xD;
" You can trust me, at least. It may be that I&#xD;
cannot agree with you, that I shall even be* forced to&#xD;
condemn your work; but I can respect your motives.&#xD;
&#xD;
I do not flatter myself I could aid your cause if I&#xD;
would; but I can guard ydur honor."&#xD;
"Then I need not fear to speak before you.?"&#xD;
"Carl!"&#xD;
"I mean that I did not know but you would con-&#xD;
sider your duty to your country 'would require you to&#xD;
betray your husband."&#xD;
"I have been too often tried, as you know, and&#xD;
been proved too weak for any such Spartan virtues for&#xD;
you to fear me now.'~~&#xD;
"It is a great relief to me," he answered; "I am&#xD;
always afraid of your heroic, Puritanic New Euglana-&#xD;
ers. I do not care how hardly you blame us to our&#xD;
faces, so you keep our secret. You will have to meet&#xD;
all sorts of men, Georgie darling, men that I hate. to&#xD;
have t'o breathe the~ same air with you, men that I&#xD;

'there are things that will seem strange, perhaps re-&#xD;

intellect to know such things must be, and to make&#xD;
allowances for all; and, remember, we see our onside&#xD;

"You do not seem to have succeeded over well in&#xD;
your conventions," I said, at dinner, to relieve an em-&#xD;
barrassed silence, or a more embarrassing attempt at&#xD;
small talk among the gentlemen. "Are good men&#xD;
and true men so scarce that you could not find a wor-&#xD;
thy candidate among them?"&#xD;
"It was a sad affair," said one, without lifting his&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Mrs. Abertlinay," said my husband, significantly,&#xD;
"although of Northern birth, is very free from North-&#xD;
ern prejudices; and though she will pot let me, quite&#xD;
yet, call her an earnest friend to our cause, she is, at&#xD;
least, a noble and trusty foe."&#xD;
Every one looked relieved, and a gentleman next&#xD;
me offered me his hand; "* such a foe speedily becomes&#xD;
a friend," ~he said, "we welcome you.~'&#xD;
"I shall not allow myself to be called your oppo-&#xD;

Provided he is of our choosing," said a Li~ii~&#xD;
Gwynn, one of my husband's classmates at West Point.&#xD;
"1 don't think we ne~d trouble ourselves," answer-&#xD;
ed Mr. Layton; "Abraham will be an excellent patri-&#xD;
arch for us as for the North. He was especially made&#xD;
for this emergency, if I know the man; we'll let the&#xD;
North have him to its heart's content."&#xD;
"But he is the Republican choice," I said.&#xD;
"Most fortunately, we think, some of us-most for-&#xD;
tunately, Mrs. Abertlinay, for us, they have chosen.&#xD;
the very man who will help us best," answered Mr.&#xD;
Layton again. "We think him, some of us, an obsti~'&#xD;
nate, self-willed, ignorant third-rate attorney. You&#xD;
mustn't mind our saying it, you know, because he may&#xD;
turn out a second Washington, whom, by the way, I&#xD;
never considered any very great shakes of a man.&#xD;
Yes, he is the Republican choice, and if we can only&#xD;
get him elected we are all right."&#xD;
"But even granting the man to be a fool," I said,&#xD;
"how can you be willing to have a Republican Presi-&#xD;
dent ?"&#xD;
"Because, my dear lady, we want only one more&#xD;
wrong to perfect our plans. To speak plainly to our&#xD;
trus 4/ foe, every thing is ready for the explosion; we&#xD;
only want the match to start it."&#xD;

band's anxious face, I changed the word to "address,"&#xD;
"cannot but succeed. But do you think Mr. Lincoln&#xD;
will be elected?"&#xD;
"Beyond a doubt," answered a small-featured fiery&#xD;
seeming little man on my right, who had not before&#xD;
spoken,. "They will elect Abraham Lincoln; they&#xD;
will dare force on. us a Black Republican President; a&#xD;
rail-splitter, a low-bred, vulgar backwoodsman, for our&#xD;
ruler!"&#xD;
"Goad!" cried Lieut. Gwynn, "work that up into&#xD;
an~ditorial to-morrow; it will tell; it is very sugges-&#xD;

"Not so fast," interposed Mr. Layton, "who knows&#xD;
but the Yankees will take you at your word, and be&#xD;
afraid to put upa vulgaria; likeAbe."&#xD;
"There is no danger; Abraham is the New Eng-&#xD;
land Coriolanus they like the idea, it is a new one,&#xD;
and they will stick to it. Besides, too, many of my&#xD;
beloved brethren of the press know what they are&#xD;
about."&#xD;
"That's. your department, friend Risley," Lieut.&#xD;
Gwynn said; "you wield the pen and I the sword."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It will not come to that," remarked Mr. Layton.&#xD;
"It may," replied my husband. "At all events&#xD;
we must expect it. 'We may never need to strike a&#xD;
blow; but we must be prepared to strike many, and'&#xD;
perhaps to lose our h6ads for it."&#xD;
"Very improbable," returned J~Ir. Layton, who was&#xD;
evidently a man of peace. "I doubt if it will be more&#xD;
than the settling of a few law questions, and the dis-&#xD;
play of a few tricks by that excellent attorney, Abra-&#xD;
ham Lincoln. What think you, Mrs. Aberthnay?&#xD;
Will the North let us go in peace, do you think?"&#xD;
"How do you mean 'go?"' I asked.&#xD;
"Orderly, quietly, and according to law, if they&#xD;
will let us; with flourish of trumpets and roll of drums,&#xD;
if they will not."&#xD;
"This is something so unexpected and unsuspected&#xD;
at the North," I said, "that in the first surprise she&#xD;
might forbear immediate violence; but the peaceable&#xD;
separation of one State from the Union can never be."&#xD;
"It is rather late in the day to talk of the chances,"&#xD;
said my husband. "For mypart, I want no peaceable&#xD;
separation. I am for war-war to the knife."&#xD;
"And I!" cried the Lieutenant.&#xD;

"So you don't mean to take in New England?"&#xD;
I asked.'&#xD;
"Not if we know ourselves. New England has&#xD;
been the skeleton in our closet long enough; if we&#xD;
take her in ever, it will be by conquest," said Mr.&#xD;
Layton.&#xD;
"Then youbid her an eternal farewell 1" I exclaimed.&#xD;
"New England, indeed!" broke out Lieut. Gwynn.&#xD;
"Better than sweeping down to the Gulf, as Mr. Lay-&#xD;
ton says, would it be to see South Carolina and Mas-&#xD;

each other. ~d bet my all on the issue."&#xD;
"The Massachusetts men will make the best fight-&#xD;

"For sonie.~. reasons you are very right, Mrs. Ab-&#xD;

all the ex4danatiOn5. "An army must fight for a prin-&#xD;

more it will affect the fighters. Besides, the morale is&#xD;
half its power, and a New England man, whose will is&#xD;
stronger than any other emotion belonging to him,&#xD;
must fight well if he fights at alL The Westerners&#xD;

"Rig1~t, sir!" was the laconic reply from the Cap-&#xD;

"I count very little on help from the North," my&#xD;

"And I every thing!" cried Mr. Risley; "we have.&#xD;

wise; but for them our glorious undertaking could&#xD;
never come to its culmination."&#xD;
"How is that?" I asked.&#xD;
"Northern merchants supply us with arms and&#xD;
ammunition.-"&#xD;
"Has it come to that?" I exclaimed.&#xD;
"Come to that? Why, my dear lady, it has been&#xD;
at that this many a day. As I was observing, or about&#xD;
to observe, the Northern press, partly with knowledge&#xD;
and partly in ignorance, form public opinion, and&#xD;
there is often a big swing around our way; Northern&#xD;

&#xD;
host of Northern writers, speakers, and demagogues&#xD;
generally, fighting lustily for us."&#xD;
"This thing has gone far," I said.&#xD;
"Almost to the end," one answered.&#xD;
*   "And, gentlemen, just among ourselves~ what do&#xD;
* you expect the world to say of you?"&#xD;
"As it does of all schemes: if successful, just; if&#xD;
unsuccessful, infamous. '&#xD;
"And your consciences?"&#xD;
"Applaud us!" answered my husband, enthusi-&#xD;
astically.&#xD;
The Captain here showed some interest in the con-&#xD;
versation..&#xD;
"And history ?" I continued,&#xD;
"Will judge us as the world judges," replied Mr.&#xD;
Layton, "according to our ~ ~&#xD;
"Successful or failing," I asked, "will it forgive&#xD;
* yo~fort~einfinite miseryyo~r movement ~aycause~&#xD;
Will it forgive you for the blood of the bravest and&#xD;

If you have wrongs, remember no state or society&#xD;

&#xD;
yours. Let the good of humanity decide you, let the&#xD;
tears of countless widows move you, let the sorrow&#xD;
of unborn generations plead with you, for, successful&#xD;
or failing, truth and justice wm pronounce you rebels&#xD;
J and traitors."&#xD;
My husband looked at me aghast; the Captain was&#xD;
silently balancing a spoon; the others looked not over-&#xD;
pleased, and in this manner we left the table.&#xD;
"I have given my homily, and eased my con-&#xD;
science," I added;' ." Mr. Aberthnay will give you&#xD;
cigars, and by and by I will give you cofl~ee and mu-&#xD;
sic, which I hope you will like as well as either.'~&#xD;
The Captain went to the door with me, and even&#xD;
followed me out into the gallery. Here he paused&#xD;
and handed me a letter. "I have not quite known&#xD;
whether or not to send it," he said; "you have de.&#xD;
cided me not, and you deserve to know your victory.&#xD;
After reading, please destroy it."&#xD;
I understood the letter moderately well: it was the&#xD;
resignation of his commission. I remember the name&#xD;
very well, efame8 Belton~, written in large round let-&#xD;
ters, perfectly characteristic of the Captain, as one&#xD;
knew at a glance.&#xD;
"For God's sake, Georgie," whispered my husband,&#xD;
preceding the others into the parlor, "atone for that&#xD;
cruel speech." -&#xD;
I Saw already its uselessness; I understood that I&#xD;
was endangering, for no purpose, my own and my hus..&#xD;

baud's security. Poor fellow I had I not already&#xD;
wronged him enough ? So I did my best to make up&#xD;
for that which I had said. I promised the Editor let-&#xD;
ters from the North; I played chess with Lieut-.&#xD;
Gwynn,1let him beat, and complimented him on his&#xD;
skill. " It may make you a General one of these days,"&#xD;
I said. -I sang Mr. Layton's favorite songs, and when&#xD;
they were all in better humor with me, I went into a&#xD;
heavy political argument with them, and allowed my-&#xD;
self to be almost vanquished, which is as much as one&#xD;
can expect of a New England woman.&#xD;
" We shall have you an enthusiastic Spoutherner&#xD;
soon," said Mr. Layton.&#xD;
I shook my head.&#xD;
"I am2 sure of it," he added; "I never ask more&#xD;
than to find my opponent open to conviction. You&#xD;
would be a -good friend now, only I perceive Mr. Ab-&#xD;
erthnay has not set the ai-guments before you."&#xD;
"Ah, you must not corivince me,".I said.   -&#xD;
" We will let you off after that, Mrs. Aberthnay,"&#xD;
the Lieutenant said ; "that one sentence half promises&#xD;
surrender. The North itself will finish the work." '&#xD;
So, on the whole, they went away pleased, as men&#xD;
always are when they have demonstrated their supe-&#xD;
rior minds. -&#xD;
I watched my husband long after the others had&#xD;
gone, as he lay back in his arm-chair lost in thought-.&#xD;
He seemed to have grown years older iu the few&#xD;
&#xD;
months lately passed. How he must have suffered,&#xD;
been suffering, while I, his wife, his only friend, kept&#xD;
.her heart closed to him.&#xD;
I went around to where he sat, softly, and laid my&#xD;
hand on his forehead,; it was burning. Smiling up to&#xD;
me with 'that love which never failed, he laid his head&#xD;
over my heart. " Let me take a little of its care," I&#xD;
said ; "I who give it so much."&#xD;
" No, no, Georgie; it was of your care I was think~&#xD;
ing; if we could only bear every thing together. Re-&#xD;
ligious differences between my wife and myself was&#xD;
the only thing I used to fear; who would have thought&#xD;
. so small a matter as politics, a subject which we once,&#xD;
do you remember, pet Georgie, thought unworthy of&#xD;
a few moments' careless thought, 'should now divide&#xD;
us !"&#xD;
" I did not mean to speak so strongly," I said ;&#xD;
"the words surprised me as much as they did you."&#xD;
" I was not thinking of.that ; you could not help&#xD;
speaking as you did: they honored you,--Southern&#xD;
men always honor frankness ; they respected the feel-&#xD;
ing which dictated your words. All of them, except&#xD;
perhaps Captain Belton."&#xD;
"Did he not like it ?"&#xD;
" He was the only one who spoke of it. He said it&#xD;

"Yet he spoke to me, and gave me a letter to de-&#xD;

"He will have time to change his mind around&#xD;

"I am glad ho has left us; we want none with us who&#xD;

"Not a particle."&#xD;
"Then I'm to have your bodily presence, without&#xD;

"You're a barbarian!"&#xD;

WE were not destined to get away without&#xD;

I was convinced it was only a reply in words, and r&#xD;

and worried, and I felt, myself, impatient to have the&#xD;
coming hour go by.&#xD;
I was cross, which always, among those I dislike,&#xD;
makes me suspicious; and it was not long before I dis-&#xD;
covered that somebody was wanted to be added to&#xD;
their friends, who had, so far, resisted all allurements;&#xD;
and it was thought, as this somebody was socially in-&#xD;
clined, a few womanly persuasions, properly disguised,&#xD;
might attain the desired result, and it would be, I fan-&#xD;
cied, a result of great importance to my husband's&#xD;
side. My well-known Northern birth and generally&#xD;
supposed Northern prejudices, and perhaps some nat-&#xD;
ural tact, made me,. I suppose, chosen to apply these&#xD;
~' womanly persuasions.~~&#xD;
Having quite satisfied niyself of their desire, I&#xD;
amused myself watching their plans of attack. The&#xD;
MajQr, who was clearly an ambitious, dashing man,&#xD;
recognized soni6thing of similar qualities in me, and&#xD;
only doubted" if I had the grit to do this thing." I&#xD;
think Mr. Beames was a man of a higher order of mind,&#xD;
and must have known that I could not work except in&#xD;
confornuty with my own convictions. Mr. Miles had&#xD;
implied his motive-key in his half-heard speech to my&#xD;
husband; for, after all, people judge us very much af&#xD;
ter the fashion of their own order.&#xD;
"Well," said the Major, "things look much as if&#xD;
there was a prospect of a lively time before a year has&#xD;
passed. The days are approaching; they have already&#xD;
&#xD;
commenced, I may say, that make history, Mrs. Ab-&#xD;

knew, in New York, who saw fit to marry her father's&#xD;
coachman, who, likely enough, had as fair a start in&#xD;
life as many a worthy frien&amp;amp; of the lady's father. One&#xD;
could not undertake to tell the books that were written&#xD;
on the subject; the veritable history of half a thousand,&#xD;
more or less, heroines, black-eyed and blue, tall and&#xD;

designated as gins. Think what a relief to our&#xD;

breathing American works; no hash of English and&#xD;
French romance, or ridiculous imitations of European~&#xD;
society, but outright American books, with just such&#xD;
tastes, thoughts, and doings as we see surrounding us.&#xD;
I believe half of the success of Mrs. Stowe's Uncle&#xD;
Tom's ccz1~n lay in the fact that it was a genuine&#xD;
American book, which, even though it was hard upon&#xD;
us, we read because it belonged to us. We shall have&#xD;
a history, 'a national history, not a humdrum, worn-out&#xD;
story of Pilgrims and Plymouth Rocks. We shall&#xD;
have heroes now that will not only suffer and be pa~&#xD;
tient, but toil and be strong. Altogether, I think we&#xD;
shall put some new elements into t~ie minds of men&#xD;
living now, and leave something more than a name fbr&#xD;
ages yet to be."&#xD;
"Who knows," said Mr. I3eames, "the legends yet&#xD;
td cluster around our names,-the names of us who sit&#xD;
here, under Mrs. Aberthnay's eyes, that are half ridi-&#xD;
culing and half inspiring our enthusiasm? If I can do&#xD;
no more, I will, at least, write a song, some of these&#xD;
days, for the populace to sing; for there's more power&#xD;
in~ the jingle of some popular rhymes than in half a&#xD;
hundred 'speeches.' Witness the revolutionary 'Yan-&#xD;
kee Doodle!"'&#xD;
"We are laying a glorious foundation," the Ma*jor&#xD;
now told us, having been too long kept from the&#xD;
charge by our skirmishing, "as Mrs. Aberthnay, under&#xD;
&#xD;
all her fine sarcasm does not fail to admit. I would&#xD;
like to get through all our coming battles with my&#xD;
1~ife and my eyes, for the comfort of one day reading&#xD;
the attempts to do justice to the history that, as J said&#xD;
before, we are making. But who can ever do justice&#xD;
to the. boldness, skill, and courage of our men,-.to the&#xD;
wit, the beauty, and the heroism of our Women?"&#xD;
"You let in the woman element?" I asked.&#xD;
"I should give up our cause as hopeless," he an-&#xD;
swered, "were there not in every rank and degree&#xD;
brave and beautiful women, with the address and the&#xD;
courage to aid us. Never was there a wider sphere&#xD;
for womanly work; and I know our Southern women&#xD;
will be behind none, Spartans though they may be, in&#xD;
showing this to be so. What a scope for their tact&#xD;
and their talent, their courage and their tenderness,&#xD;
while the weak are to be nerved, the vacillating to be&#xD;
steadied, and the opposed to be converted&#xD;

ammunition, and in the pause Mr. Beames commenced&#xD;
his attack.'&#xD;

"It ain't every one as can understand them high-&#xD;

the Major, for the 'grit of the thing,' and for promotion,&#xD;
like enough. Some goes in, like Mr. Beames, because&#xD;
they hate the North, and do kind of believe the old&#xD;
Union ain't exactly the thing."&#xD;
" You make shrewd guesses," said my husband.&#xD;
" How about the rest of us ?"&#xD;
"I should say you, Mr. .Aberthxiay, take to the&#xD;
thing because it's grand and romantic, and sounds like&#xD;
Bruce and William Tell. I hope you'll get the glory,&#xD;
sir. Some goes in, like Mrs. Aberthnay-" I&#xD;
"But I don't ' go ini,'" I interrupted.&#xD;
" But you will," he answered. " You've got the&#xD;
nerve, and when your husband gets in a tight place&#xD;
you, ain't. the woman to leave him there. You ain't a&#xD;
going to crowd down all your fine ideas of things, and&#xD;
leave Mr. Aberthnay down here among a parcel of&#xD;

" So you heard of that ?"&#xD;
"Yes'm; and we knows very well it's what we'll&#xD;

" I go in, ma'am, for a beef conti-act the Major has&#xD;
promised me. That is in my own line, ma'am. We&#xD;
-all has our motives."&#xD;
"You are an observer of things, I see, Mr.&#xD;

" Yes, ma'am; it ain't my way to go through the&#xD;
world with my eyes shut. I looks around and I sees&#xD;
heaps of things that maybe other people don't think&#xD;
.big enough to count: I counts them."&#xD;
" As you have seen so much of the world," said the&#xD;
Major, " suppose you tell us how we can take Fort&#xD;
Blank, in case we need it ?"&#xD;
" A dashing assault by a smart woman, and noth-&#xD;

There was an awkward silence.&#xD;
"I suppose you have travelled a great deal, Mr.&#xD;

"Never outside of Virginny until now, ma'am.&#xD;
Virginny's a likely old State."&#xD;
" There will be lively times there one of these&#xD;

"I hope not," Mr. Beames remarked. "Virginia's&#xD;
more than a likely State, as our excellent friend ob-&#xD;
serves; it is a noble old State, which even the Yankees&#xD;
admire. I cannot imagine such a thing as soldier-tents&#xD;
in view of those grand old nia~nsions, unless placed&#xD;
thare for a holiday parade. I never could see why any&#xD;
fault was found with Thackeray's 'J'~rgi~nians.' I think&#xD;
he gave the spirit of the State truthfully, and in a way&#xD;
to do her sons honor."&#xD;
"I wonder if Kentucky will come over?" the&#xD;
Major asked.&#xD;
"Has not our excellent going-to-be President an&#xD;
interest in Kentucky?" Mr. Beames interrogated..&#xD;
"If so," my husband 'answered to both questions,&#xD;
"the worst will be that it will be neutral, which will&#xD;
do very well as a means of communication with the&#xD;
~"orth, should harsh measures be used."&#xD;
~' You talk," I said, "as. if your Mr. Lincoln were&#xD;
already elected, and had declared war against you."&#xD;
"Elected he is pretty sure to be," responded the&#xD;
Major, ".~nly you must not allow your Northern friends&#xD;
to crow over you in advance; declare war he never&#xD;
will, I am afraid."&#xD;
*   "Afraid?  You officers are so bloodthirsty!" I&#xD;

"Iii till be almighty tough work to carry Virgin-&#xD;

&#xD;
"Ohio is near enough to keep her straight, that's&#xD;
true," said the Major; "but we can count on one of&#xD;
her sons," smiling upon Mi~ Miles.&#xD;
"If Virginny goes, I goes," answered that gentle.&#xD;
man; "I goes with my State."&#xD;
"May every State that hesitates pay dearly for&#xD;
her cowardice!" the Major observed with emphasis.&#xD;
"Let them choose at once, and be open about it."&#xD;
"No doubt we shall all pay dearly for our course,"&#xD;
returned Mr. Beames. "No one ever attempted a re-&#xD;
form of the most moderate dimensions without paying&#xD;
for it; but we have the glorious consolation of know-&#xD;
ing that we buy our liberty cheap at any price, and&#xD;
we must beprepared for whatever may come."&#xD;
"We shrink from nothing," my husband said, with&#xD;
a fire that made me proud of him; "we are prepared&#xD;
to sacrifice every thing except the principles which&#xD;
are dearer to us than life, even than those we hold&#xD;
dearest. I bid you farewell now, my friends, in doubt&#xD;
and indecision in regard to the future; but about one&#xD;
thing there can be no hesitation* among patriots--.&#xD;

challenge to ~fafr fight,' nor satisfy with less then half&#xD;
your happiness, nor dose, nor doctor, nor diet! These&#xD;
were the people that widened the little brook between&#xD;
Carl and me, until it became, I feared, an impassable&#xD;
river. I feared, for, strange to say, I had not yet&#xD;
learned to hate my husband; I was not even careless&#xD;
of his love; whether it was my pride or my vanity, or&#xD;
some unknown emotion, I clung to his love; I was&#xD;
more tenacious of it, more fearful of losing it, than I&#xD;
could have been had I loved him. To have Carl's&#xD;
heart shut' to me as mine was to him, was the one&#xD;
most agonizing thought of my married existence;&#xD;
and these people, with their homilies and their excla-&#xD;
mations, their raillery at Carl's devotion, and their&#xD;
congratulations to both of us, bade fair to realize that&#xD;
burning fear of mine. I knew that the time must&#xD;
come;-all the world knows it finds a foothold often&#xD;
even where love has been, and never fails to reign in&#xD;
the unprotected places where Love has never set up&#xD;
defences,-4he time when I should weary of Carl,&#xD;
should hate him really, long to have him out of my&#xD;
sight, and pray, if I dared, for the day to come that&#xD;
would remove every vestige of his influence, every&#xD;
sign of remembrance out of my life. I used to think,&#xD;
as by some strange fascination, of that day, and to pic-&#xD;
ture myself bound to this~ man whom I. no longer sim&#xD;
ply endured, but actively detested. You may think it&#xD;
~: drove me to an attempt at loving him, who was in&#xD;
&#xD;
every way so worthy of love, but I had long before&#xD;
resolved I could not love him; I had married him&#xD;
with his eyes and mine wide open to the fact; of&#xD;
course I could not change.&#xD;
Few people will fail to start when I call that sum-&#xD;
mer of 1860 a weary summer for it was generally a&#xD;
gay season; more people went travelling than usual,&#xD;
and as they were warm but healthy months, the change&#xD;
of air and change of scene benefited all who had them,&#xD;
and looks and spirits prospered accordingly. Wide-&#xD;
Awake processions made the nights brilliant outside,&#xD;
and theatres and parties kept brilliance within. People&#xD;
were lively, confident, and seemed to hold money&#xD;
lightly in their hands. How many, it hurts my heart&#xD;
to think how many, took their leave of joy, and ease;&#xD;
and sunshine that summer, to them so beautiful, and&#xD;
forbearing to prophecy aught that could dim its bright-&#xD;
ness. I toiled through it as best I might; I listened to&#xD;
the hollow talk of those around me, and I fancied I&#xD;
felt what prophets feel, when they stand within the&#xD;
gates of a city unconscious that destruction and wrath&#xD;
is coming speedily.&#xD;
Carl and I were growing more and more distant to&#xD;
each other; the constant 'presence of visitors at my-&#xD;
uncle's house kept us apart during 'a greater portiQn&#xD;
of the day, and when we found ourselves, without&#xD;
our will, in each other's presence, it was only to real-&#xD;
ize how far we were from that happy trust which the&#xD;

world imputed to us; and we sat constrained and often&#xD;
long Ailent, trying to think of things to say, which, if&#xD;
thought and said, sounded so forced and hollow, that&#xD;
we~ as* by a mutual agreement, came at last to give up&#xD;
the attempt at conversation. I think Carl had greatly&#xD;
counted on my visit North to bring us closer together,&#xD;
by throwing me more upon his care; but it had had&#xD;
the opposite effect, and we were both wearied nigh&#xD;
unto death. And now Carl no longer sought my&#xD;
love; more and more I saw he no longer let his eyes&#xD;
rest on me with wistful tenderness, and that more and&#xD;
more he grew abstracted and self-absorbed. It was&#xD;
easy to see how it would end,-indifference on his'&#xD;
part, hatred on mine. I was not yet twenty-five years&#xD;
old, and the prospect was not a pleasant one. My&#xD;
husband,-through all he would be my husband still,-&#xD;
migbt replace me with enthusiasm for his country, but&#xD;
I had nothing to put where his love had been; and&#xD;
while every hour that love was slipping like sand&#xD;
through my fingers, the world cried out, "Oh, incom-&#xD;
parable pair! Oh, noble husband and devoted wife!"&#xD;
Just about so much does this world know!&#xD;
Of my old friends nearly all were as I left them.&#xD;
Rate was not married, and was travelling somewhere&#xD;
among the mountains; Mr. Stuart was in business in&#xD;
New York; Mary Allen and Emma Lewis were both&#xD;
in convents; Emma, among the Sisters of Charity. I&#xD;
went to see her; I love these dear, Martha-like sisters.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
There is magic in the very tones of their voice, mag-&#xD;
* netisin in the touch of their hands,-..-those patient,&#xD;
never idle hands; and comfort comes with every step&#xD;
of those willing feet vowed to' walk in ways of sin and&#xD;
sorrow and pain, untouched, unhurt, as the children in&#xD;
the fiery furnace.&#xD;
" How did it come into your mind?" I asked&#xD;
Emma.&#xD;
"I thought of it first," she answered, "that night&#xD;
at your uncle's, when we went in to see Mary Allen,&#xD;
do you remember? and for a while I thought of it as a&#xD;
pleasant dream, until it grew a longing, then a hope.&#xD;
I am a woman too much after the manner of Martha,&#xD;
and it was natural I should choose to join the Sisters&#xD;
of Charity, who have the love and the faith of Mary&#xD;
and the activity and solicitude~ of Martha. There is&#xD;
nothing,-I mean when I was in the world,-nothing&#xD;
touched me more than the simple unaffectedness of&#xD;
1~hese dear Sisters; there is no bitterness, no contempt&#xD;
real or assumed, of the world they have left; it was a&#xD;
good world, they say, and they liked it, but they liked&#xD;
this life better; they are still a part of the world, still&#xD;
toiling in it, still breathing its air, though purified by&#xD;
prayer and good works. Another thing which is&#xD;
characteristic of our Sisters, they never affect to~ have&#xD;
been' any thing while in that world; there are no half-&#xD;
drQpped sentences, no conscious glances, no affected&#xD;
interest or indifference which intimates,-.--Ionce wa8 a&#xD;

simply and quietly they have put on the dress of the&#xD;

unaccustomed awkwardness, it is the same."&#xD;
"You are right, Emma; I have seen these things,&#xD;

These little things are mighty indexes, and they are so&#xD;

"Is there. not more than usunl excitement about&#xD;

"Yes, there is a great deal; the South threatens to&#xD;
secede if an abolition President is elected. Do not&#xD;
imagine, Emma, if you were fifty times a nun, that you&#xD;
have no duty left to your race and your country; the&#xD;
smallest duty you have is that of interest; you are to&#xD;
teach not merely a b ab, and 2 and 2 are 4, but to&#xD;
teach that fidelity to God absolutely requires loyalty&#xD;
to our country, a loyalty that binds women as well as&#xD;
men, Sisters of Charity as well as members of the&#xD;
Cabinet, girls at school and men in business, all ages&#xD;
and classes. A Catholic priest has no more right to&#xD;
give absolution for disloyalty unrepentant, than for~&#xD;
robbery or perjury. You do not forget these things?"&#xD;
"I may be a Sister of Charity," Emma said, "but&#xD;
I have not lost my country or my sex. More than&#xD;
ever am I taught to do my duty scrupulously, and&#xD;
next to my God is my duty to my country."&#xD;
"You are ~ true, good woman, 'Emma, and I see&#xD;

softening grace."&#xD;
So I left Emma, one out of my old circle of friends&#xD;
joyous and contented. Mary Allen I did not see; she&#xD;
belonged to a community of nuns who lived entirely&#xD;
within their convent walls, and lacked the genial light-&#xD;
hearfedness of the Sisters, and I had no desii~e to see&#xD;
Mary growing "old and formal, fitted to her petty&#xD;
part."&#xD;
My Cousin Florence, to my Aunt Graham's un-&#xD;

a decent cup of tea. He joined my husband in his&#xD;
solicitations to me to remain at the North during the&#xD;
winter; not that he believed there would be any.&#xD;
trouble-for he pooh! poohed! the idea-but to ease&#xD;
Carl's mind, he said.&#xD;
I was not so fierce against staying as I had been,&#xD;
for Carl was now so distantly, politely kind to me, that&#xD;
I sometimes half fancied he wished me out of his way,&#xD;
for his sake as well as for my own. Sometimes I&#xD;
thought if he *ere separated from me the old love, the&#xD;
old yearning, would spring up in the absence, and make&#xD;
him again my lovar; but there was a possibility that&#xD;
he might like his freedom better and better, and that&#xD;
the separation begun in affection might end in life-long&#xD;
estrangement. Yoit know I had not, yet reached the&#xD;
point in our lives when I was to hate Carl, and so this&#xD;
possibility frightened me,-I could be frightened,-and&#xD;
made me shrink from the dreadful picture of myself; a&#xD;
mark for every one's wonder and astonishment: a&#xD;
woman neither maid, wife, nor widow. Considerable&#xD;
of the old spirit had died out; I could think in quite a&#xD;
listless way of Carl's going alone into danger and&#xD;
death, and of myself resting in peace and security;&#xD;
for after all, I was not sure I could make the danger&#xD;
and death less real and sorrowful by my presence.&#xD;
You must not think Carl was unkind to me, for he&#xD;
was only too kind; every arrangement was made with .; '~&#xD;

self was always at my disposal to go or come as I&#xD;

I could but wait, patiently as long as I could, then in&#xD;
anger and indignation.&#xD;
Partly because I thought it might move him, and&#xD;
partly because I cared, or thought I cared very little&#xD;
what became of me, I yielded, coldly enough, to their&#xD;
wishes, and said, that as my duty was to obey my&#xD;
husband, I would of course remain at the North if he&#xD;
'wslTled it.&#xD;
"I do wish it," he said.&#xD;
"I submit, of course," I answered, and turned back&#xD;
tQ ,my book.&#xD;
jjj~ "I do' not wish to offend you," my husband said,&#xD;
$ ~$ when we were alone, "but I must insist upon your&#xD;
~I remaining here; I am confident there will be war be.&#xD;
4V tween the two sections, and the safer place will be the&#xD;
North, and the happiest place, certainly, for yc~u whose&#xD;
sympathies are with the North."&#xD;
"I thought we had settled the question before we&#xD;
left Charleston. I was not aware, nor Aid I in the&#xD;
least suspect the trip North which was to give me so&#xD;
niuch pleasure, was intended merely as a trap to lure&#xD;
me~'here and leave me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It was not intended to leave you; but' since I&#xD;
have been here I have learned the insecurity of 'a honie&#xD;
at the South, and it has made me most anxious to have&#xD;
you left here."&#xD;
"You are very solicitous about my happiness."&#xD;
"I wish to do for you the little that I can. I&#xD;
know I once thought it in 'my power to minister more&#xD;
fully to it, but I know now that I must be grateful if&#xD;
I can secure you against bodily discomforts."&#xD;
"Then you .do not love me any more," I forced&#xD;
myself to say.&#xD;
"What is my love to you? A constant axinoy-&#xD;
auce, a source of vexation to us both. Perhaps&#xD;
wheii we see each other again we may understand&#xD;
each other better; I shall pray God that it may be so,&#xD;
as I never prayed for any thing before."&#xD;
"I have tried t4 do my duty to you, Carl."&#xD;
"Only too well; but it is no pleasure to me,-~rather&#xD;
a pain,-to be the cause of so much constraint to you.&#xD;
I must go back early to-morrow; you know, of course, &#xD;
*that~ if at any hour your present home wearies you I&#xD;
will come for you, be it through what it may.'~&#xD;
"You are an excellent husband, Mr. Aberthnay; a&#xD;
lady told me the other day that for dressing ix~ ~ty1~&#xD;
and attending to my wisbe; you were unrivalled, I&#xD;
shall not write for you to come; you can choose your&#xD;

A pang went through my heart. "it sounds as 'if&#xD;

'KNot'at all, only until such time as you say. It is&#xD;
nQt 'safe for you at the South."&#xD;

*     "Oh, tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,&#xD;
That bright and fierce and fickle 'is the South,&#xD;
And 4ark and true anil tender is the North."&#xD;
Bright fierce and fickle though he might be, I resolved&#xD;
he should not escape me'; stay I might until he had&#xD;
gone, and then I would go too; I would track him&#xD;
night, n&amp;amp;ontide, and morn, in some disguise always.&#xD;
near him, not from love, but pride, the pride that&#xD;
hated him who oppressed it so.&#xD;
I knew an evil spirit possessed me, and I tried the&#xD;
charms of music to exorcise it; but it moved neither&#xD;
the evil spirit nor my cahw husband reading in the&#xD;
library, for I could hear the slightest rustle of his&#xD;
book, although the change of my position hid from&#xD;
my view his Roman-like face, By aiid by out of my&#xD;
irresolute chords there was moulded an air, and out of&#xD;
my restless thoughts some words that sung as I sung&#xD;
them had both point and force, though weak enough,&#xD;
perhaps, as I give them now, unpolished, or in any&#xD;
way bettered from that rough dash:&#xD;
"Oh, your sternness becomes you well, mon brave,&#xD;
And goes to my poor heart,&#xD;
And cuts with agony too deep to tell&#xD;
So well you act your part.&#xD;
I'm grieving in a sad, sad maze, mon bi*ve~&#xD;

Before I had finished I heard my husband lay&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
* WE were back Southjust before the elections; the&#xD;
excitement was terrible, but I liked it better than the&#xD;
old calm. Men like my husband who looked deeply&#xD;
and were prepared for the worst, were the only calm&#xD;
men one met; the women Were fierce for war, for war,&#xD;
as we i~ead of it, is romantic enough, and in our long,&#xD;
luxurious peace how could we realize its horrors?&#xD;
My husband had had me do enough shopping, while&#xD;
at the North, to last us for a ten years~ siege, it seem-&#xD;
ed; and now he was busy superintending every thing&#xD;
on the plantation himself. Courteously and tenderly&#xD;
be cared for me; but it was with the chivalry of an&#xD;
old4ime knight for the lady under his protection, more&#xD;
than the ardent love for her whose colors he wore.&#xD;
He built every manner of defence around me, but&#xD;
never warned~ me, cautioned, or denied me in any&#xD;
thing. When he went up to Charleston in~ the winter&#xD;
he attempted no remonstrances against my accom-&#xD;
p~nying him, although I was sure he knew there were&#xD;
dangers at every step foi' me there. mostlyy all of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7997-00000076"/>&#xD;
those of Northern principles who could, had already&#xD;
left'the South; in the country towns a few had been&#xD;
forced away; ~nd as violent demonstrations were not&#xD;
modified for the sake either of rank or sex, it was&#xD;
wonderful that I walked as safely as I did.&#xD;
A great many sad scenes passed under my eyes, in&#xD;
which I could not interfere. I saw one, one day as I&#xD;
was passing by one of the hotels, shutting my ears as&#xD;
best I could to the swearing crowd which had collect-&#xD;
ed on its steps. A " Yankee" was being examined&#xD;
by the self-constituted court of inquiry, pretty cer-&#xD;
tain of the sentence usually given to all "spies," or&#xD;
those suspected of being opposed to the South. Just&#xD;
as. I came near the little knot of men, the victim,&#xD;
whom I could not see, appeared to have succeeded in&#xD;
imposing a kind of silence upon them, and to be&#xD;
addressing them in his own defence. Something in&#xD;
the matter or manner of his language made me pass&#xD;
very slowly by.&#xD;
"I tell you I am not a spy," he was saying; "I&#xD;
have nothing t6 do with public affairs; I came here on&#xD;
my own private account; I have seen nor heard noth.&#xD;
ing that I care to remember. My ears and eyes have&#xD;
been only for one whom I came here to find, and whom&#xD;
I Znust findZ'&#xD;
This was as much as they allowed him to say; abut&#xD;
eventhe Northern accent would have won me, so obey..&#xD;
ing t~u impulse I stopped and looked at the crowd, who&#xD;
&#xD;
were laughing and swearing heartily; fortunately I&#xD;
recognized among them a man who had done some&#xD;
work for my husband.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Taylor?" I asked of him.&#xD;
"Only another spy; we're going to give him a lit-&#xD;
tle~ airing, ma'am."&#xD;
"It's very foolish," I said. "What is one man,&#xD;
especially one man who does not care for either side?&#xD;
Yes," I continued, seeing I had attracted the atten-&#xD;
tion of one or two others, "it is very foolish; such&#xD;
things won't frighten the Yankees; it will only make&#xD;
them mad for nothing. Wait until 'old Sumter comes&#xD;
down if you want to scare them. This man can't&#xD;
hurt us. Let him find her;" I said her designedly;&#xD;
"there's a kind of romance in every man's heart. We&#xD;
shall have work enough by and by; who minds one&#xD;
man?"&#xD;
"Is he a friend of yours?" one asked.'&#xD;
"I have never even seen him," I answered;" but I&#xD;
want you to keep your fight for better use."&#xD;
Two or three grumbled, one or two laughed, and&#xD;
they all stared; one spit out his tobacco juice and&#xD;
swore I was right: "The d-d Yank might go to&#xD;
hell and be d-.--d for all he cared."&#xD;
I gave this one some money to drink confusion to&#xD;
the yankees, and with one or two jests and threats the&#xD;
group separated, to straggle into the bar-room. As&#xD;
soon as they were gone I went back to the man; and.&#xD;

spoke to him. "Do not trust to a second chance of this&#xD;
or any kind. These men will soon be back, mad with&#xD;
liquor; there will be no rescue then. I do not know&#xD;
who you are, but I will do for you what I can. Go to&#xD;
the next street. I will drive and meet you there; and&#xD;
if you take my advIce, you will let me send you at&#xD;

the little a Southern woman has been able to do for&#xD;
you, go back and speak with as little bitterness as&#xD;
possible of the South."&#xD;
As soon as I had rapidly spoken these words, we&#xD;
separated to meet again as I had arranged. The car-&#xD;
ria~ge had been left at a store where I found it; at my&#xD;
hasty gesture the stranger entered it, and I-I had no&#xD;
choice-followed. I expected to save him, having&#xD;
*cQmmenced, and I knew a private carriage, especially&#xD;
with a lady in it, was protection.&#xD;
*       When we were face to face, and the carriage had&#xD;
started, I for the first time really looked at my com-&#xD;
panion's face.&#xD;
*      It was Gilbert.&#xD;
I thought I had forgotten having first hated him;&#xD;
for a moment I remembered him intensely; the next&#xD;
I remembered all that stood between.&#xD;
"You have done a strangely rash Thing, oh man&#xD;
of exceeding great calmness!" I said.&#xD;
"Yes~" he replied; "but it has repaid me .well,~&#xD;
&#xD;
and I owe yOU my'life. I owe you more than my life;&#xD;
I owe you joy that you did this thing, and for-me."&#xD;
* "I did not know you, did not dream who you~&#xD;
were until five minutes ago."&#xD;
"And had you known, would you have left me to&#xD;
their mercy ?"&#xD;
I felt his dark eyes bent upon me, burning into&#xD;
mine, as of old; heroes have faced death with less&#xD;
courage than I fh~ced him there.&#xD;
"I could not do less for an old friend than for a&#xD;
stranger," I answered quietly; "but I should scarcely&#xD;
have succeeded so well had I known you. We are go-&#xD;
ing now to my home; supposing you a stranger, I in-&#xD;
tended leaving you here, where there is moderate&#xD;
safety; but as it is, I prefer to go home, and then let&#xD;
Jack take care of you. You see I look upon it as a&#xD;
matter of course that you will leave the city at once.&#xD;
If there is any thing toward the accomplishment of&#xD;
your work here that either Mr. Aberthuay or I can do,&#xD;
do not hesitate to command. us."&#xD;
"I have found the one I sought in finding you," he&#xD;
returned, "and am now willing enough to go. It is&#xD;
true the last words I heard from you were of well de-&#xD;

&#xD;
yet who, nevertheless, was resolved some appeal&#xD;
shotild be made to you, some assistance given you to&#xD;
leave this accursed city, for it is terrible to think of'&#xD;
*the trials of body and mind that must beset you here.&#xD;
You' of the South are deceiving yourselves with the&#xD;
belief that 'the North will not fight. I tell you the&#xD;
North wrn light, and fight with a force and persistency&#xD;
such as the 'world has not lately seen. You at the&#xD;
South are rushing headlong to your destruction; we&#xD;
at the' North are quiet in the consciousness of power.'&#xD;
For what has the South, with the curse of treason&#xD;
f&#xD;
upon its head, to oppose to the legioxis of the North,&#xD;
strong in the knowledge of right and loyalty? There&#xD;
is no safety anywhere in the South for Northern men&#xD;
or Northern. principles; even Mr. Aberthnay's influ-&#xD;
ence cannot make you secure, after the storm bursts,&#xD;
if you remain true to your country, and it is not in&#xD;
your nature 'to' be false to it. Your mind is too clear&#xD;
a mind to be deceived by any secession sophistry; you&#xD;
know very well your duty to the nation before the&#xD;
State; you cannot blind yourself by any States Rights'&#xD;
arguments,-the cursed heresy that threatens the life&#xD;
of our Constitution, that 'has been fed and fostered,&#xD;
cherished and petted, until it has grown strong enough&#xD;
to poison, adder-like, the hands that forbore to kill it&#xD;
in its infancy. If ever you desert your country and&#xD;
league with her enemies, you must "do it with your&#xD;
eyes open to the crime. Surely you will not do it.&#xD;
&#xD;
Too well I remember you as a brave girl praying&#xD;
for a martyr's trials. I have heard you too eloquently~&#xD;
and too powerfully upholding adherence to principle&#xD;
through all things, to believe you will do the thing&#xD;
you have so often scorned, yield right to expediency."&#xD;
"I do not need to be toki my duty," was all the&#xD;
reply I could force myself to make.&#xD;
"I know it, dear Miss Vane; I beg your pardon&#xD;
for addressing you by the old name. And knowing&#xD;
your duty, how can you stay here ?* It is madness to.&#xD;
attempt, it; folly to refuse safety. We ar~ just learn-&#xD;
ing, the best of us, what 'it means to love our country,&#xD;
to love its flag. We find it inspires a love' as passion-&#xD;
ate and intense as any possible emotion; by and by&#xD;
you will hunger and thirst to stand under the folds of&#xD;
our stars and stripes, when, perhaps, ~it will be too&#xD;
late. For the sake of that old. flag, for the sake of the&#xD;
family ties it suggests, if not the principles it rep~e-&#xD;
sents, come back to it. I cannot tell how small you&#xD;
were when I first held you up to see it floating from&#xD;
Bunker 11111 and Fanuiel Hall on national holidays;&#xD;
nor how many years before you could add, two and&#xD;
two together we tried, you and I, to count how many&#xD;
flags we could see from steeple and spire, and how&#xD;
many stars each one held. Can you bear 'to feel you&#xD;
can never look upon that flag again except as an enemy&#xD;
and' an outcast? Come back to it, Georgie, while yow&#xD;
can; do not stand apart' from it in its hour of trial..&#xD;

minds, and his own bitter knoWledge that you have&#xD;
deserted your country and league with. its enemies?&#xD;
It will amount to that if you stay now; you know it&#xD;
will."&#xD;
"I have listened to you without interruption," I&#xD;
said, "not because I have heard or expected to hear&#xD;

I can and will say, that I shall never violate my own&#xD;

Say that you will, Georgie, for the sake of your friends,&#xD;

say you will return."&#xD;
"I have given my answer," I said, as we left the&#xD;
carriage, and stood under the shadow of the trees in&#xD;
the dusk of the evening, at my own door. "My. car~&#xD;
riage is n~w at your service'; do not think of returning&#xD;
for any thing to the hotel, but get out of the city to&#xD;
night; if possible; you must make it possible. Tell&#xD;

ever I do, they need not blush for me. I thank them&#xD;

Mr. Stuart, for the effort you have made. Whatever&#xD;
happens, whatever they hear of me at home, let them&#xD;
no~~ dare judge me; and you, Gilbert, you must not&#xD;
reproach me, even now.~~&#xD;
He bent down under the shadows of the trees, and&#xD;
quietly said: "You 'shall not be judged nor reproach-&#xD;
ed; but I had rather you had left me 'to the mercy of&#xD;
those men, than that from your own words I should&#xD;
learn the mission which I risked my life to fulfil should&#xD;
have failed."&#xD;
I turned to the house, and he walked deliberately&#xD;
to~'Vhe carriage, whose hur~'ying wheels sounded like&#xD;
~the angry thi~eatenings of fate as they rumbled ah~ng&#xD;
the s~mingly deserted street~&#xD;

F had been victor in the contest, it is true, but it&#xD;
was a victory dearly won. It was an hour or two before&#xD;
I felt myself able to meet nay husbands who had come:&#xD;
home some few minutes after. I had left Gilbert.&#xD;
I found him in the library, with his head resting&#xD;
on his folded arms, and his arms on the table. He&#xD;
scarcely looked at me as I entered, which was strange,&#xD;
for he always received me as politely, and with almost'&#xD;
as much ceremony, as if I had. been a visitor. I felt&#xD;
tenderer toward him for the struggles I . had~ been&#xD;
through that afternoon; but I said only a few com~~&#xD;
monplace words, as I made some little changes in the&#xD;
arrangement of the curtains and the furniture.&#xD;
"So," he said to me at last, "so you have come&#xD;
out as a public speaker, have you? And for the benefit&#xD;
of Gilbert Stuart; it is very interesting, indeed it has&#xD;
quite a touch of romance in it. And what, I wonder,&#xD;
is Mr. Gilbert~Stuart doing here; he'd a great deal&#xD;
better be at home ploughing his old Massachusetts&#xD;
farm. Very likely he would like to take you home&#xD;
with him,-.why not go?"&#xD;
Poor fellow! ho'i~ lie must have suffered before&#xD;
he could insult me!&#xD;
"IVZ&amp;amp;y? Because my husband is here."&#xD;
"Yes, it is my fault; I who brought you to this;&#xD;

baGk 'of my brutality, of me who keep you here!&#xD;
Why not go.; the North is at rest, it is only we who&#xD;
~u~'er; leave us ito our fate. Go, Georgie."&#xD;
" I thought we had -settled that question times&#xD;
enough," I said. "Are you tired of me, Carl ? V&#xD;
"Tired? I am tired of every thing;, myself and life,&#xD;
and with it all I am killing you with the contest&#xD;
between your divided duties."&#xD;
"My duties are not divided," I- answered, meeting&#xD;
his vehemence as I would a child's, and lifting the&#xD;
bright rings of hair from his forehead with the same&#xD;
kind of tenderness; "when will you cease to fear for&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Never, Georgie, while I live; I took cruel ad-&#xD;
vantage of your kind heart once,, though God knows I&#xD;
thought no wrong, and 'the memory of that day stands&#xD;
a0(a constant reproach t&amp;amp; me. Oh! could I but have&#xD;
seen clearer the happiest way for you! had only had&#xD;
strength to sacrifice myself for you! And you,&#xD;
Georgie, why did you ever marry me?"&#xD;
"Because you asked me," I answered; "you did&#xD;
not expect me to ask you, did you ? ~'&#xD;
"Don't laugh; it sounds so horrible. In a . few&#xD;
bours we may see things that will prevent us from&#xD;
ever laughing again."&#xD;
"What has happened now?" I askeil, eating my.&#xD;
self by him.&#xD;
"There is no doubt that ships are outside the~&#xD;
&#xD;
bar trying to re4~nforee Sumter; they must not&#xD;
enter."&#xD;
"But this is an old story, Carl, it may vanish like&#xD;
the rest."&#xD;
"G d grant it may not," he answered; "would to&#xD;
God the first blow were~ struck, and we were fairly in&#xD;
action ; this suspense is killing us and our cause. Our&#xD;
Governor is unsatisfactory, and we only half know&#xD;
who are with us."&#xD;
"Is every thing ready in case of an attack?"&#xD;
"Ready! we have been ready too long; we want a&#xD;
decisive act, something that will show the men of the&#xD;
South, yes, and the men of the North too, that we are&#xD;
~n earnest; we want our men to feel they are 'in for&#xD;
it,' past choice, past. change; this they will not feel&#xD;
until the Federal Government has declared war&#xD;
against us. God speed ~he day! I cannot face these&#xD;
dangers for you, Georgie. If I were. in the North&#xD;
now, with my sympathies as they aee, I should be wild&#xD;
as a caged lion."&#xD;
"I am going to bear it easier than that," I said.&#xD;
"So long as there was chance forchoice I spared neither.&#xD;
logic nor persuasion to urge you to make it with 'your&#xD;
country; you have made it against your country;&#xD;
you think. yoi~i have done right, I think you hare&#xD;
done wrong; but it makes no difference in my regard.&#xD;
for you. I cannot change my sentiments; we owe&#xD;
allegiance to the United States, not to North or South.&#xD;

Because you are my husband I shall stay here ; because&#xD;
th&amp;amp; nation against which you rebel is ~my nation, I&#xD;
sl~all love it and honor it as I always have. I shall&#xD;
never by word, look, or deed, do any thing that I&#xD;
think will aid your cause or hurt my own. I shall aid&#xD;
mine when I can. I do not say I shall hurt yours, for&#xD;
my honor to you requires me to keep to myself what&#xD;
*     I kno'~w through you. I shall try to act according to&#xD;
my conscience, and yet to injure neither you nor&#xD;
myself. Does this satisfy you?"&#xD;
*        "It ~s mo~v generous of you; but oh! Georgie,&#xD;
what a maw I might be if I could only feel as others&#xD;
do, that the eyes I loved watched me with pride and&#xD;
encouragement."&#xD;
"Dear Carl, if a man ever sinned in the belief he&#xD;
was doing right you are that man; and I look to you&#xD;
toY prove as true to the cause in whicl4 you believe as&#xD;
if it were my cause too. May I ask you one thing:&#xD;
if ever you see thi&amp;amp;thing as I do, as a treason, a crime,&#xD;
and a curse, will you give it up?"&#xD;
"As sure as there is a sun in the heavens! T&amp;amp;&#xD;
draw my sword from its sheath bu1~ once, for a cause&#xD;
whicib F no longer believed just and right, I would&#xD;
count murder."&#xD;
"You are a true man, Carl, God bless you. If&#xD;
ever' angels wept over invincible ignorance they are&#xD;
weeping 110w, but it is ignorance sb invincible that it&#xD;
will si'~re you.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER xv.&#xD;
ONLY a few hours more and war was inaugurated ~&#xD;
a few days further and my husband came to me in his&#xD;
major's uniform, proud and exultant, though lie had.&#xD;
come to say his last good-bye. It was our very first~&#xD;
separation sin.e our marriage. I had been less than&#xD;
woman had not my heart ached for him, as he stood&#xD;
before me in his~noble manhood, hi~i ever bright face&#xD;
radiant with enthusiasm, and every noblest emotion&#xD;
of human life glowing in his eyes. I did not wish to&#xD;
deceive him as I might if I showed him half my feel-&#xD;
ing; for in his eager longing how could I hope he&#xD;
would analyze my emotion, and say: "This she says&#xD;
from pity, this from pride, this from native tender-&#xD;
ness." I had,' at least, this honor left, that I would'&#xD;
not give him hope I could not realize; so I bound&#xD;
down my rising pity; and admiration, and intense&#xD;
terror, and quietly as might be received his. last&#xD;
convulsive embrace. He cried 'like a child then,&#xD;
while I played with the bright rings of. hair that'&#xD;
clustered lovingly around his forehead, cried&#xD;

&#xD;
kissed my hands, my eyes, and hair, and reaching the&#xD;
door turned back and strained me to his heart; then&#xD;
the band played, an~d he mounted hi~ horse, and with..&#xD;
out another word or glance, without lifting his eyes,&#xD;
he took his place, and rode from my sight; a purer&#xD;
face, a nobler form, never went to battle yet since&#xD;
time began.&#xD;
Do not ask me of the days that followed; there&#xD;
was an agony in their strained calmness that has left&#xD;
scars upon my soul that will last until I die.~ The&#xD;
North I heard, had flown to arms as one man, but the&#xD;
force. sent against us was far, far too small; I shudder-&#xD;
ed when I heard the number. Seventy-five thousand&#xD;
citizen soldiers to stand against the long-trained men&#xD;
of the South, fighting, every man of them, as if the&#xD;
.4&#xD;
quarrel were his own, and on his own strength and&#xD;
sJ~U depended its issue~ I shut myself in my own&#xD;
hoi~se as much as I could to avoid hearing the insult-&#xD;
ing remarks of the Union's foes. My husband's letters&#xD;
were my only society; they were rich in interest, in&#xD;
thought, and incident. I could not shut out the&#xD;
rejoicing over the battle of Bull Run, which was a&#xD;
graud ~Southern victory, and which was as fuel and&#xD;
Ilame to the" Rebels." My husband's letters did not&#xD;
speak of it as enthusiastically as I expected them to:&#xD;
"It is, in some respects, a victory that will hurt us&#xD;
much,'? ~e wrote; "it is the first intimation to, the&#xD;
K~tEtb~v they are not out on a holiday pa~de; it&#xD;
~-~-&#xD;
&#xD;
has too many resources,. her enthusiasm is yet too un-&#xD;
cooled, to make this defeat an exti~gtd8Aer, as our&#xD;
good friend Montreuil, who is wild with joy, and very&#xD;
tipsy with whiskey, calls it. Our victory has come&#xD;
~ too soon for us, we shall be more easily discouraged&#xD;
later, for it; t1m~ir defeat has come too soon for the&#xD;
North; it is raw meat to a hungry buibdog, enough&#xD;
to whet his appetite, not enough to satisfy his&#xD;
hunger."&#xD;
Again there were wild rej~icings over the massacre&#xD;
atBalrs Bluff: "I cannot rejoice," wrote my liusban~t;&#xD;
"I can glory in whipping my enemy in fair and open&#xD;
fight, but there is little joy in a victory thrown into&#xD;
your hands by the stupidity of a blundering general.&#xD;
The greater part of the killed atBall's Bluff were Massa~&#xD;
cbusetts young men, Harvard students, who had learn-&#xD;
ed their law and. their loyalty in the same buildings&#xD;
where I spent my early college days, dreaming of some.&#xD;
body-you know whom! Po~or fellows! One man,&#xD;
Dr. W-~--, I think you knew him, he was an old chum&#xD;
of mine, I saw after the battle; he was shot in the&#xD;
river trying to save a friend, to whom ~his ~is1er~was&#xD;
engaged, and who was so wounded as to be unable to&#xD;
swim. There will be wailing in old Massaohusett~&#xD;
when she hears of these things. There were some&#xD;
splendid things done on our side; not alone hrtvre&#xD;
deeds, but things that showed the quickness and&#xD;
*the 'rigiIane~ of our of~1cers; they are never caught&#xD;

napping, which, as you may divine, is worth more&#xD;
than much skill and strategy."&#xD;
I can hardly tell how I lived through the months&#xD;
- that followed; after every 'skirmish even, I waited in&#xD;
trembling fear for news of my husband, in giore than&#xD;
mortal fear, for I sometimes questioned if God should&#xD;
be less merciful than we, how could He who had said,&#xD;
~"Render unto C~esar the things that are C~sar's,"&#xD;
receive my poor husband if he should die in rebellion&#xD;
against 'his Government, which had given him no&#xD;
cause for complaint.&#xD;
Until June my fears were without foundation; and&#xD;
then one daya letter came to me by 'private hand,&#xD;
from the son of one of my earliest Southern friends:&#xD;
"It becomes my painful duty," he wrote, "to&#xD;
inform you, my dear madame, that Major Aberthnay&#xD;
Was quite 'severely wounded in a late skirmish with the&#xD;
enemy, and has very much retarded hk own cure by&#xD;
his restlessness and impatience to join his command,&#xD;
or, since that has become impracticable, to go bome.&#xD;
?Believing it to be entirely in accordance with' your&#xD;
wishes, II have taken advantage of a favorable oppor-&#xD;
tunity to write you, although the Major eariiestly&#xD;
opposes any thing that can bring to you the knowl-&#xD;
edge of his very painful condition,, which is much&#xD;
more serious than he imagines. We have been so~&#xD;
~fortunate as to b~ve the Major at our 'own house,&#xD;
~where my sisters vie with each' other in their efforts to&#xD;
&#xD;
assist him. Feeling confident you would scarcely&#xD;
forgive me should I obey your husband's injunctions,&#xD;
and leave you ignorant of these fa~ts, I have taken&#xD;
the liberty of stating them. My leave, of absence,&#xD;
which has enabled me to take medical care of ;Major&#xD;
I&#xD;
Abe$hnay, is about expiring, and I shall be obliged to&#xD;
A'&#xD;
1ea~re him to such care as very inexperienced nurses&#xD;
can render; convinced, however, that the ~xaediuine&#xD;
he least needs is that which a surgeon can bestow.&#xD;
Although within the Federal lines, Major Aberthnay&#xD;
is in perfect security. It will, I am sure, be the liret&#xD;
impulse of your heart to endeavor to meet your hus.&#xD;
band; and should you be able to leave home, I am&#xD;
requested by my mother and sisters to assure you of a&#xD;
hearty welcome: there will be very little difficulty in&#xD;
eluding the Federal vigilance." Some directions,&#xD;
simple enough, were then given, and with one or two&#xD;
apologies for the intrusion, the letter concluded.&#xD;
It would have been grief enough to know my hus-&#xD;
band were wounded: to be told of it against his&#xD;
wishes, to ~realize how great must have been' the dan~&#xD;
ger when an almost' entire stranger thought it neces-'&#xD;
sary to call me to his side, were emotions impossible&#xD;
to describe. As quickly after 'reading the ~letter as. a&#xD;
dress could be changed and a carriage ready I was&#xD;
on my way to the depot, and fortunate enough, by&#xD;
one 'hasty spring, to* find place upon the train just&#xD;
movingg from the depot.&#xD;

&#xD;
I wrapped myself in my travelling cloak and sank&#xD;
back in my seat, motionless as a statue without from&#xD;
the verysu~ging of my soul within. My whole life in&#xD;
this world and the next seemed to hang upon the&#xD;
chance of arriving in time, at least to hear the words&#xD;
I deserved so little, "I forgive."&#xD;
And if life were given to him longer still, how I&#xD;
would pray until I had saved him from all further&#xD;
dangers!&#xD;
I never counted that journey by hours or by days.&#xD;
I know nothing how I found my way. I remember&#xD;
only a dark night, a lonely street, a quiet house, and&#xD;
myself wildly begging admittance. It was very late;&#xD;
a white-headed old gentleman cautiously opened the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"Let me in, I beseech you," I said; "I am, Mrs.&#xD;
tAberthnay."&#xD;
He opened the door wider, and I sprang into the&#xD;
hall; the gentleman opened the door of a room at one&#xD;
side of the hall, and spoke my name; a group of fright-&#xD;
ened, wondering faces, instantly gathered around me.&#xD;
"I am Mrs. Aberthnay," I repeated; "is my hus-&#xD;
band here?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Aberthnay, is it possible? Come in, my&#xD;
dear," one said, drawing me into the open room.&#xD;
"You are very kind," I said; "I wauld like to see&#xD;
my, husband, at once, if you please.. Dr. M- wrote&#xD;
me he was here."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let me give you a cup of tea," she said.&#xD;
"Is not my husband here?" I asked.&#xD;
"lIe 'was wounded, you know," she answered;&#xD;
"and have you come all this way alone, dear Mrs. Ab-&#xD;
erthnay? I cannot tell you half how glad I am to&#xD;
see you."&#xD;
"I know, I am sure of, it, my dear Mrs. N-; but&#xD;
do tell me of Major Abertlinay. Is he here?"&#xD;
They looked from one to the other; and with that&#xD;
mistaken kindness so many people use, they said a&#xD;
few commonplace sentences, and tried to remove my&#xD;
things. At last, however I forced the truth from&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Some one had told of my husband's concealment&#xD;
at their house. He discovered his danger, and being&#xD;
determined to die sooner, than be taken prisoner,&#xD;
against their prayers and tears, and all their argu-&#xD;
ments, he had insisted upon leaving them. David, his&#xD;
trusty servant, was with him, and he had gone no one&#xD;
knew where. There were only women in the house;&#xD;
the gentleman who had opened the door was a neigh-&#xD;
boi, who had come to them the day before from the&#xD;
ruins of his once splendid home, burnt by the "Yan-&#xD;
kees." There had been no one to accompany my hus-&#xD;
~band, only David.&#xD;
Then they told me of his wound, and of the rest-&#xD;
lessness and impatience which had put him back very&#xD;
much; and then that he grew sa4 and melancholy, and&#xD;

&#xD;
made no effort to rally, seeming to take no interest in&#xD;
any thing except the letters fror~i me, which had been&#xD;
sent him from headquarters whenever there was an&#xD;
opportunity, and then it was that Dr. M- became&#xD;
frightened and sent for me, and I was too late.&#xD;
No one tried to sleep that night; good, affectionate&#xD;
women, they gathered around me, and told me every&#xD;
incident of his stay at their house; how the doctor&#xD;
had brought him there first, what they had thought,&#xD;
'how courteously he had thanked them, how gently he&#xD;
ever spoke to them, while they could see he was inward-&#xD;
ly fretting; how one of the girls had been his favorite,&#xD;
because she was like his wife. These and a thousand&#xD;
trifles besides, such as love and tenderness are made&#xD;
~f; they told me with as much minuteness as if I had&#xD;
been Carl's own fond and loving wife; and I heard&#xD;
Them, and thought in my heart how they would hate&#xD;
me could they know the coldness, the cruelty I had&#xD;
shown the man they honored so much.&#xD;
* At' the first dawn of light I started under the&#xD;
guidance of their one remaining servant, whose assist-&#xD;
ance they forced me to accept, to find my husband;&#xD;
and then it was* that, for the first time since the war,&#xD;
as I neared the city,' I saw the old flag again.&#xD;
I saw it again. Not the prodigal, with the weight&#xD;
of hisphysical cares a~d moral guilt, leaving the husks&#xD;
which the' swine did eat for the old home luxuries, ran&#xD;
faster to meet his father on the way, wept with, greater&#xD;
&#xD;
joy under that father's blessing hands, than I, when,&#xD;
weary and almost heart-broken, a rebel and a traitor if..&#xD;
you choose, I 'saw once more the flag I had deserted.;&#xD;
saw it again, the dear familiar stripes, the bright, un-&#xD;
fallen stars floating joyously, grandly, in the soft sum-&#xD;
mer breezes,---" the loyal winds that loved it well." I&#xD;
did not know I had so much of impulse and fond emo-&#xD;
tion left within me, as I, who had shed not a tear dur-'&#xD;
ing all these days of terror and suspense, who had ut-&#xD;
tered not a single groan' when I learned the bitter&#xD;
knowledge of their uselessness, sprang forward, while&#xD;
tears rained from 'my eyes, to stand once more beneath&#xD;
its fojds.&#xD;
Another lay on the ground beside me; a soldier's&#xD;
flag, stained with rain and mud, and oh! its olden&#xD;
whiteness dark with blood; torn and tattered, thrown&#xD;
aside as useless, perhaps, how eagerly I pressed it to&#xD;
my lips, and caressed it and bathed it with my tears!&#xD;
Just then the morning sun burst through the mists&#xD;
that had hung over us, birds sang merrily on every&#xD;
tree, and for a few moment I forgot I was searching&#xD;
for a suffering, perhaps a dying husband.&#xD;
"When I write Carl," I thought, "I will tell him&#xD;
just how the morning looks."&#xD;
Then I trembled and my strength left me. I might&#xD;
never write to Carl again.&#xD;
He was not at his old command; I had found&#xD;
friends everywhere to help me pn, but none to tell iiie&#xD;

&#xD;
of h m. "He was on sick leave, and we supposed him&#xD;
home," was my most satisfactory answer. Then I&#xD;
hurried back, picturing Carl alread'~r there;. actually&#xD;
looked for' him to meet me when I reached the city;&#xD;
so thoughtful, so courteous had he ~ever been to me&#xD;
that I could scarcely realize myself standing in the&#xD;
hi~rrying crowd without Carl's eager face ~to welcome&#xD;
me, CarPs protecting arm to lean upon. I rushed to&#xD;
the house; it was dark and close; no one had entered&#xD;
it, but .the servants coming and going, since I left.&#xD;
Then I sat down and cried.&#xD;
"Massa berry likely stop somewhere, he' be berry&#xD;
tired and sick," suggested one of the servants,, and the&#xD;
thought was a good one; and actingg upon it I found&#xD;
comfort and consolation. .1 arranged the rooms; I&#xD;
worked over Mrs. Glynn's receipt-book, preparing all&#xD;
mannerr of delicacies to tempt hi~ taste; I sprang to the&#xD;
door, if ever an officer passed the window; a hundred&#xD;
times I cried, "This is he!" but Carl did not come.&#xD;
Why should he? Had I been such a wife to him that&#xD;
he should care to come? and if he did come, would he&#xD;
be satisfied with tender nursing and dainty food?&#xD;
But David same, and told me his story.&#xD;
"Massa berry weak, me table and no house, no&#xD;
nothing; I do my best. One day massa called me and'&#xD;
say:. ~. I am dying this time, David, and no mistake.'&#xD;
'Ali, no, Massa' Carl,' I say, 'I go foraging and you&#xD;
get better;' but he just shake his head, and IL went on&#xD;
&#xD;
a little way to find a house or some place for Massa&#xD;
CarL I find some, berry nice people, and we all go&#xD;
after massa, but de 'Yanks were dere first; when dey&#xD;
was gone, der was no Massa Carl, only just him coat&#xD;
he'd bin laying on 'fore I went 'way."&#xD;
Two or three days after letters reached me which&#xD;
gave nw fuller accounts; a prisoner had seen my hus-&#xD;
band brought into the Federal camp on a stretcher;&#xD;
several of the officers had tried to assist him,' but&#xD;
he was too far gone. They had all felt much interest-&#xD;
ed in him from his fine appearance; but the prisoner&#xD;
could. only -say he 'had been kindly cared for, for in a&#xD;
few hours there was a surprise by the Confederates in&#xD;
which tlie informant was ~taken prisoner. Further&#xD;
information came later. He had lived only a 'few&#xD;
days, but had been cared for to the last, and was&#xD;
buried in a portion of the battle-ground in 'which&#xD;
Confederates and Unionist had been buried together.&#xD;
Every kindness, every praise of him, every sympa.&#xD;
thy possible the officers gave me; he had been widely&#xD;
loved' and honored for hi~ soldierly' skill and daring,&#xD;
and his noble and knightly character.&#xD;
If one ray of light could, have come in upon the&#xD;
darkness of my heart,' it would have come' in the&#xD;
thought that he had died for a cause he had loved and&#xD;
honored; but seeing with the clearer light of immor-&#xD;
tality his spirit would recognize the right, while his&#xD;
body rested under the folds of the true flag.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
WITH my husband's death died all that bound me&#xD;
to the South. I utterly loathed the war and every&#xD;
thing concerned with it. Free to feel, free to 'think,&#xD;
at last, according to my own convictions, I made no&#xD;
attempt to disguise its deformity, its wretchedness,&#xD;
the wickedness of ,its motives, and the enormity of its&#xD;
sin. I 'went, as I had done before, to the hospitals, for&#xD;
I knew how many, like my husband, had gone into&#xD;
the war as conscientiously and as heroically as your&#xD;
bravest Northern general; but oh! I longed with all&#xD;
my heart, it was a dream beyond any hope, to stand&#xD;
among brave ITnion men, and toil for them!&#xD;
I did not dare look so far as my old home; I dared&#xD;
not hope ever to live under the dear flag again; but I&#xD;
did dream of an escape somewhere, anywhere out of&#xD;
that accursed city, every stone in the streets of which&#xD;
seemed to mock at me. My friendliness was com~&#xD;
plete; many who honored my husband had shown me&#xD;
many kind attentions, but I felt as if I had no&#xD;
right to them. I had felt always, especially since&#xD;
&#xD;
A. STORY 013' OUR CIVIL WAR. 1 '75&#xD;
&#xD;
my visit North, as if I were wearing honors I did 'not&#xD;
deserve.&#xD;
'How many of the pale faces that hurried past me&#xD;
covered the same weariness of heart, I did not ask; but&#xD;
as I saw their tenderness to the soldiers, their devo-&#xD;
tion to their cause, my heart cried out more than ever&#xD;
to be at the North, aiding in like manner the land I&#xD;
loved.&#xD;
"David," I asked one morning of him who was&#xD;
now a hero among his fellow servants, "what has be-&#xD;
come of Lizzh~, I have not seen her for several days?"&#xD;
"Dunno, missus."&#xD;
"Yes you do,'David; answer me."&#xD;
"Oh, br, missus, if yer looks in that way 'specks:&#xD;
I'll have ter answer. 'Specks Lizzie's whar George&#xD;
is." George was her husband, living in another part&#xD;
of the city.&#xD;
"And where is George?"&#xD;
"Dunno, missus, 'less de Yanks got hold of him;&#xD;
dey's awful ticfs, dey is."&#xD;
"I wonder if they would steal me," I said; but&#xD;
forming the thought into words became too much for&#xD;
me, and I could not keep back the tears. When he saw&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XV1I.&#xD;
IT was intensely hot in Richmond and in its neigh-&#xD;
borhood, but the heat was the least of our trouble;&#xD;
~the "Yankees" were at our very gates, and the city&#xD;
seemed moulding itself into one vast hospital on&#xD;
account of the wounded soldiers daily arriving, and&#xD;
the constant departure of all well persons, soldiers, and&#xD;
civilians, who could get away. As for~ those who&#xD;
remained,-it may have been tue reflection of my own&#xD;
~ loiLeliness,-they seemed borne down by anxiety and&#xD;
care; there were some who loudly spurned all fear of&#xD;
a nearer approach of the Federal army to Richmond;&#xD;
there were others who trembled lest at any moment&#xD;
the dreaded Yankees might burst in upon us. Con-&#xD;
fusion dwelt everywhere; our army, broken and ex-&#xD;
hausted, could offer but a feeble resistance, and what&#xD;
was there to prevent the Union army from dashing&#xD;
into our very nddst?                    -&#xD;
Many urge4 me to join them in leaving the city,&#xD;
but I only shook my head. "What use?" I said, "as&#xD;
well noW as later;. it makes no difference." "Her&#xD;
&#xD;
husband's death has broken her completely," they&#xD;
said.&#xD;
I went from place to place in a fever of restless-&#xD;
ness. Whenever I was in the city I visited the hospi-&#xD;
tals, and gave largely of help and money, so that my&#xD;
loyalty was held as a model to others. But I could&#xD;
not rest anywhere, nor stay in any one place. Once&#xD;
I walked up and down a depot; some one had said a&#xD;
train of wou~ided soldiers was to pass there, and I&#xD;
tried to solace my feverishness by planning some as-&#xD;
sistance for them.&#xD;
A young girl who seemed to be even more impa-&#xD;
tient than myself~, finally addressed me: "Do you&#xD;
know any thing about the* train? Will it come, do&#xD;
you think?"&#xD;
"I know nothing forr certain," I answered, "but it&#xD;
seems to be expected by very many; we can only&#xD;
wait."&#xD;
"Only wait / I am tired to death of waiting; I&#xD;
have been here ages."&#xD;
"You are expecting some one&#xD;
"Partly, Papa has been wounded, and I go to&#xD;
every depot and every train to meet him. My poor&#xD;
papa! I wish they'd come! Probably, after all, papa&#xD;
won't be there* I have been disappointed so many.&#xD;
times! Are you expecting any body?"&#xD;
"No," I said, "I have not even the comfort of&#xD;
dread or fear."&#xD;

"Oh! how hard!" she exclaimed:&#xD;
"'Not to dread because all is taken,&#xD;
Is the loneliest depth of human pain.'&#xD;
But It is a proud thing to have lost any one in this&#xD;
war."&#xD;
I did not answer.&#xD;
"I shall do something desperate if this thing goes&#xD;
on much longer," she said.&#xD;
"Dear child," I could but say, "rather thank God&#xD;
that he has left you even suspense."&#xD;
She turned perfectly pale. "If God took papa," she&#xD;
said, "I would.-"&#xD;
She could not finish the sentence. 12 wondered, if I&#xD;
had loved Carl, would I have felt the revenge and&#xD;
* airy her broken sentence showed?&#xD;
~ "I wonder how you all bear it so calmly," she&#xD;
began again: "you must be very patient."&#xD;
"We never know," I answered, "until we are tried,&#xD;
how much we can bear. Your father for whom you&#xD;
are waiting, has he been long in the army?" I added,&#xD;
to change the subject.                       I&#xD;
"Oh, from the first; I was in New York, and papa&#xD;
ordered me to. stay there, but I ordered myself to&#xD;
come here. Well that I did,~or there would be no one&#xD;
to take care of papa."&#xD;
"I have lived a great deal in New York," I Baid;&#xD;
"that ought to make us friends almost."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I did love New York, but now I hate it. I would.&#xD;
joy to hear it burnt to, the ground."&#xD;
She had a fair complexion, soft brown hair and&#xD;
emotionless blue eyes; but she spoke with a fierce&#xD;
vindictiveness.&#xD;
"Were you ever there much?" I asked.&#xD;
"Oh, yes! I was educated there. I wish we could&#xD;
take New York."&#xD;
"If we keep half of what we' have we shall do&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"Oh, you don't know! Papa writes me all ab~ut&#xD;
the war and the North. He says the Northern Gen-&#xD;
erals don't fight like ours, and their army cannot stand&#xD;
privations as ours does. They are not heart and soul&#xD;
in the war like we are. Papa sends~..me New York~&#xD;
papers; they never agree; they are all grumbling an4'&#xD;
growling, some wanting one thing, some another;&#xD;
son~e want the army to do this, and others want&#xD;
it to do something else; and Abe Lincoln tries to suit&#xD;
them all, and so cuts up the army, and fights a little&#xD;
to suit the war people, and then compromises and&#xD;
don't fight, to suit the peace people. Papa says they&#xD;
will have another revohition up there."&#xD;
"I very seldom see a Northern paper," I said;&#xD;
"what do they find to quarrel about?"&#xD;
"I don't understand exactly; but papa says the&#xD;
Yankee rage for money-making gets ahead of patriot&#xD;
zeal for the country, and so there's a muss. They: talk&#xD;

noes; but papa says our slaves are not a circumstance&#xD;
to their foreign citizens, who don't understand about&#xD;
country and government; how can they, never having&#xD;
had any of their own? and they make as much fuss&#xD;
and talk as loud as if the whole North belonged to&#xD;
them, and won't leave the Yankees a chance to squeeze&#xD;
in a word on their own affairs. Papa made me learn&#xD;
some lines of a French poet in New Orleans once, that&#xD;
he says have proved almost a prophecy. I do not&#xD;
know if I can quote them:&#xD;

"I ought," she answered; "I learned it at Madame&#xD;
Ohegary's, where I learned many other things not. so&#xD;
commendable, such as flirting."&#xD;
"I don't think the art of flirting is ever taught,"&#xD;
I answered; "it is like Dogberry's reading and writing,&#xD;

"I don't do much of that now," she said. "This&#xD;
war has made me very solemn. How did I come to&#xD;
make you that quotation? Not to show off my French,&#xD;
you must not think."&#xD;
"I do not, indeed. You were speaking of the dis~&#xD;
turbances at the North, of which I have heard only a&#xD;
little now and then, and never before directly."&#xD;
"I remember now. They do not know what coun-&#xD;
try means at the North, where they are mixed up with&#xD;
every manner of nation. It is not like it is here; we&#xD;
are all for one side; there they are divided, and half&#xD;
of their generals, who are politicians, try to keep right&#xD;
with both sides, so that they can keep their ph~ces&#xD;
either way. It isn't like it is here. If a 'general here&#xD;
gets beaten, down he goes; only 9ur generals never do&#xD;

neared us. An officer in a colonel's uniform, assisted&#xD;
by a servant and an orderly, was among the first to&#xD;
alight from the cars; a distinct soldierly voice called&#xD;
"Gertrude," and in an instant my companion was at&#xD;
his side.&#xD;
A winning girl she was, with all her freedom and&#xD;
her careless dignity, and pretty, too; pretty, like some&#xD;
one I had seen; indeed, from the first, I had watched&#xD;
her, confident I had somewhere seen her face, or one&#xD;
like it, before,&#xD;
The wounded soldiers were obliged to be taken out&#xD;
at this point, and the confusion became almost fright~&#xD;
ful, as Confederates and Federals, our own and 'our&#xD;
prisoners, were laid upon the platform ,to&#xD;
await removal as patiently as might be. A young&#xD;
man in a doctor'suniform, whom I had not iced very&#xD;
busily watching "Gertrude," while' she was with me,&#xD;
secured me as' his assistant, and won my admiration,&#xD;
by his quickness and kindly manner to the soldiers.&#xD;
The prisoners were under guard, but no one pre-&#xD;
vented my passing among them, and doing for them the&#xD;
little I could, as I had been doing for the others; buti&#xD;
was rather shy of using a privilege which no one else&#xD;
would have thought of taking, and occupied myself&#xD;
with 'my new friend the doctor. In passing through&#xD;
the crowd a man rose staggering to his feet, but, un-&#xD;
able to sustain himself; fell almost immediately. I&#xD;
rushed to break his fall, in which I was kindly assisted&#xD;
&#xD;
by the surgeon. I saw the face of the man, and I&#xD;
made a desperate effort.&#xD;
"I cannot stay longer," I said' to the young sur-&#xD;
geon, "but I can still work; if there is not found room&#xD;
for all your wounded, I shall be really honored if you&#xD;
will turn my house," giving him its number, "into a&#xD;
hospital. To inaugurate that event I will take this&#xD;
man, who seems to have appealed to me, with me, if&#xD;
you will help me; I have a carriage here."&#xD;
"He's a prisoner," answered the doctor, pointing&#xD;
to his uniform.&#xD;
"So he is," I said; "but having made up my mind&#xD;
to take him, Federal or Confederate, it is about the&#xD;
same; I presume they will be very glad to have one&#xD;
less in the prison hospitid."&#xD;
"I have noticed a very interesting soldier, scarcely&#xD;
more than a boy, one of our own; he looks delicate, too&#xD;
delicate for hospital fare; I would like to take advan-&#xD;
tage of your kind offer for him," answered the doctor.&#xD;
"I will receive him with much pleasure," I said;&#xD;
"I will send back for him."&#xD;
* "I do not think you can take this man," he said,&#xD;
pointing to ,the prisoner.&#xD;
"I shall and must," I answered, with the decision&#xD;
of desperation. And I did take him, thanks to the ad-&#xD;
dress of my friend the surgeon, and thanks to the&#xD;
lucky chance of having' seen "aerfrude~' to whom it&#xD;
was clear I was indebted for the doctor's good-will.&#xD;

&#xD;
The prisoner, who was now almost unconscious,&#xD;
was lifted and carried to my carriage.&#xD;
The doctor, whom this hour of mutual work had&#xD;
made better acquainted with me than months of society&#xD;
meetings, offered me his coup6, but I declined, and&#xD;
showed my intention of going with theNsoldier.&#xD;
"My dear lady, that is impossible," urged the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
"Quite possible," I answered.?&#xD;
"God bless you ladies!" exclaimed the doctor,&#xD;
closing the door for me.&#xD;
"Don't," I said, "there was never less patriotism&#xD;
or charity&#xD;
I could not finish my sentence. Not patriotism or&#xD;
charity, what then?&#xD;
My patient was Gilbert Stuart.&#xD;
~ Jack, the driver, had muttered very considerably&#xD;
as Gilbert was being helped into the carriage, which&#xD;
showed me the Federal uniform was quickly recog-&#xD;
nized e~ren by that not over-intelligent African.&#xD;
Well might the doctor have wondered; every&#xD;
motion of the carriage swayed my charge, too weak&#xD;
to support himself; from side to side, My anxiety to&#xD;
escape observation almost gave way before my vexa-&#xD;
tion at my position; but I supported Gilbert as well&#xD;
as I could, and hurried Jack as much as he was willing&#xD;
to be hurried. Gilbert's uniform w~s well-worn,&#xD;
besides being thick with mud and blood; one of his&#xD;
&#xD;
shoulder-straps had been carried away, evidently by&#xD;
the ball that had wounded him; the other; a second&#xD;
lieutenant's strap, remained; as he lay apparently un-&#xD;
conscious, I succeeded in removing it, for II intended,&#xD;
or thought I intended seeing no more of him after I&#xD;
had once, placed him in such comfort as could be&#xD;
given him.&#xD;
After awhile he spoke, and I started to find he&#xD;
knew me, and called me by my old name, "Georgie."&#xD;
"I am~liere," I answered.&#xD;
"Why don't we push on for Richmond! I shall&#xD;
see her. Why don't w~ push on? Take care, there,&#xD;
now!" /&#xD;
He spoke in a sleepy kind of tone, but at the last&#xD;
word his voice rose almost to a shout, and I knew that&#xD;
he was raving.&#xD;
"Drive fast," I said, letting down the window.&#xD;
"Yes, Missus," answered Jack, dutifully, and drove&#xD;
slower than before.&#xD;
Gilbert continued his talk, which was made up of&#xD;
drilling directions, battle cries, army orders, meaning-&#xD;
less words, confused scraps of poetry, and shouts of&#xD;
"Bichmond to-night,"---once or twice he spoke, my&#xD;
name,-~.a talk so wild and conft~sed that I was terrified.&#xD;
"Drive faster~~ I ordered.&#xD;
"Yes, Missus, Nelly is berry lame."&#xD;
"Come back, Georgie," said Gilbert. "On to&#xD;

-his voi~e rising and sinking, and these the only&#xD;
intelligible words. I was more than terrified, and I&#xD;
must have shoWn it, for Jack, at my next repetition oi&#xD;
the order,-it was the first I had ever needed to repeat&#xD;
to hhn,-turned. upon the boxand looked down at me:&#xD;
"Nelly hardly walk," he said.&#xD;
"This man is suffering terribly," I said; "get on in&#xD;
some way."&#xD;
"Is yer 'fraid, Missus?" Jack asked, with a look&#xD;
that frightened me more yet.' For some reason Jack&#xD;
was angry, and beyond bounds; all the lashes in the&#xD;
South could not have subdued him then. I felt he&#xD;
had stepped over the boundary of mistress and slave,&#xD;
and for a moment I hesitated what course to pursue;&#xD;
ther&amp;amp; was a 'time when I would have mastered a&#xD;
wilder animal than he, by the very poWer of my look&#xD;
and voice. I did not feel sure of myself and dared not&#xD;
venture it:&#xD;
"Yes," I. answered, plaintively, "I am afraid."&#xD;
"Missus would have de Yank in de carriage," he,&#xD;
grumbled. "Nebber no Yankee lady take care Massa.&#xD;
Carl." An&amp;amp; more to the same effect.&#xD;
"No," I said, restored a little to myself, "but I&#xD;
know this man, and once when Master Carl was&#xD;
among strangers, and they were against him, this man&#xD;
took Master Carl's part." '&#xD;
"Missus know dat?" Jack said, and I noticed the&#xD;
&#xD;
horses went faster, as he turned to them and then&#xD;
b~ok again for my answer.&#xD;
"Yes," I said, "and I cannot let him die as if he&#xD;
had never known Master Carl."&#xD;
Jack wheeled around, and Nell~r forgot her lame~&#xD;
ness. The humiliation ef that conversation ought to&#xD;
balance many an hour of stubborn pride.&#xD;
As tlie carriage went faster Gilbert's excitement&#xD;
arose. "They are coming I 'they are coming!" he&#xD;
shouted. "Who says retreat! Oh! they've hit&#xD;
me'!"&#xD;
"Here, you good-for-nothing Diggers," Jack cried,&#xD;
as at this moment we reached home, " what for you&#xD;
stan' grinning dere?. Help."&#xD;
Then there was a rushing to and fro; every room&#xD;
in the house was made ready for use, but in the airiest&#xD;
and prettiest Gilbert was placed.&#xD;
Before I had time to think of what 'I had done, the&#xD;
doctor had made good his word, and the rooms were&#xD;
filled. Two ladies and a Sister of Charity came with&#xD;
them. One of these ladies I had long known well; the&#xD;
other, an elderly, quiet woman,- was a stranger.&#xD;
"You are to command here?' I said to the doctor,&#xD;
who had hardly waited for that permission.&#xD;
"What have you done with your tyrant? "he asked&#xD;
mein 'a low voice.&#xD;
I did not' understand him, and said so.&#xD;
"I mean th~ 'fierce invader."'&#xD;

"Oh," I said, "Jack has taken the oppressor under&#xD;
his protection. It is but in the usual order of things&#xD;
that the oppressed should turn the other cheek. Will&#xD;
you go in?"&#xD;
"I will see huiii next."&#xD;
I did not go with him; I asked the Sister of Charity&#xD;
to assist the doctor, which she did with that gentle-&#xD;
ness and readiness of perception that 'seem to be put&#xD;
on with the black cap..&#xD;
)&#xD;
"He is going. to do very well," the doctor said,&#xD;
returning to me; "I hope you will be able to keep him&#xD;
here." We talked a while about the probabilities~ ; he&#xD;
gave me directions about the others, then he grew red&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"I see your sister is not with youI think you are&#xD;
right; it would not do at all, decidedly would not do&#xD;
at all for her to be here."&#xD;
"My sister ?"I repeated; "I have no sister."&#xD;
"The young lady whom you sent off when the&#xD;
/ train arrived, is she not your sister?"&#xD;
"No, indeed; how came you to imagine so?" I&#xD;
did not say I knew of her scarcely more than he did&#xD;
himself; I needed the doctor's continued favor.&#xD;
"She looked like you," he answered.&#xD;
"Like me! That fragile, blue-eyed thing like&#xD;
me!" I did not at first see that it wasa supposition&#xD;
made to find out something of her.&#xD;
Not in physique," he answered to my look of&#xD;
&#xD;
surprise, "but a resemblance somewhere there cer-&#xD;
tainly is; a shadowy, misty, fleeting resemblance, yet&#xD;
a resemblance, like a full bugle blast and its faint, far-&#xD;
off echo."&#xD;
"It seems impossible; she is directly my oppo-&#xD;
site."&#xD;
"No, only your echo," he answered, smiling.&#xD;
"She has a lovely face."&#xD;
"God in heaven send her grace," I added.&#xD;
He went to one of the rooms, dressed a wound,&#xD;
came back, washed his hands, and accepted my offer&#xD;
of a cracker and a glass of wine, which he took hastily,&#xD;
standing.&#xD;
"Your friend is very lovely," he said, reassured&#xD;
perhaps by the wine; "'I do beseech you, chiefly that&#xD;
I may set it in my prayersher name,' or words to that&#xD;
effect."&#xD;
"O~ertrude I" I answered;. "there's satisfaction&#xD;
enough for one day.&#xD;
"That implies~ more some other day? I appreciate&#xD;

We three nurses, for now that the hardest work&#xD;
was over the Sisters had gone to the hospital, then ap-&#xD;

I sat I thought less of him than one would suppose;&#xD;

pocket for the miniature he had once shown to me.&#xD;
It was not there; but I knew now, I could not reason&#xD;
myself out of the conviction that it was not Kate's&#xD;
idealized face, but "Gertrude's;" younger, more child-&#xD;
ish, fainter-colored, than as I had seen it that day, but&#xD;
her face surely.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
IT had beQome a settled fact in the household, that&#xD;
"Missus" was taking-care of a great friend of "Massa&#xD;
Carl's," which vexed me greatly; it seemed hard that&#xD;
not even death could screen that noble name from be-&#xD;
ing mixed in deceit.&#xD;
I had told the truth when I said Mr. Stuart had&#xD;
spoken for Carl, for he had- done so, slightly- enough,&#xD;
as I recorded in* the early pages of my life; but not&#xD;
because my love for my husband's memory endeared&#xD;
even an enemy of my country who had been once his&#xD;
friend, as the servants supposed, nor on account of th~&#xD;
intensity of my charity and patriotism, as others&#xD;
thought, had I brought Gilbert there; nor yet because&#xD;
the old love lingered still. If Gilbert Stuart stood&#xD;
before me in health and 4'reedom, and offered me his&#xD;
love, the love I had striven so hard to gain, the love&#xD;
that longing for had imbittered my life, hardened my&#xD;
nature, and almost broken my husband's heart, do you&#xD;
think I would have accepted it?&#xD;

&#xD;
Gilbert Stuart, a thrill of joy ran through. my very&#xD;
soul, for I saw the chance that I might pay him back&#xD;
a debt I owed him. I owed him two debts: one was&#xD;
a debt of hatred for the blight he had put upon my&#xD;
youth; the other Was a debt of thanks that he. had&#xD;
risked his life to bring me back to honor and safety;&#xD;
I leave it to you to guess which debt was the most&#xD;
oppressive to rae.&#xD;
Very ill and restless he was, and perfectly uncon-&#xD;
scious that I was any other than a stranger to him, if&#xD;
indeed he was not unconscious of everything around&#xD;
him. Handsome, in a strong intense way, he had al-&#xD;
ways been; but, refined by sickness, his eyes bright&#xD;
with fever, and the bronze not yet worn off his cheeks,&#xD;
his was a royal face to gaze upon; and when those&#xD;
great, grand eyes that in old times had spelled me,&#xD;
4lad to be spelkd, and bound me, and commanded and&#xD;
moved and stirred my. very soul,-eyes that had been&#xD;
for years and years the light of my life, when they&#xD;
turned upon me, the old habit came with their gaze.&#xD;
Again and again I resolved to go to him no more;&#xD;
but every day I cared for him more anxiously, m6re&#xD;
tenderly, more vainly against my will than before.&#xD;
In a room opening into the one I had given Gil-&#xD;
bert, the Confederate* soldier of whom~the doctQr had&#xD;
spoken to me during the discussion about taking Gil- -&#xD;
bert, had been placed'; the quiet elderly lady who&#xD;
came with the wounded men took the almost exolu-&#xD;
&#xD;
sive charge Qf him, and we often had long talks to-&#xD;
gether as we sat by the open doors.&#xD;
"How hot it is!" she said one day; "if weonly&#xD;
had ice for their wounds! I am often grateful that I&#xD;
am caring for a stranger, just alone for the agony it&#xD;
'would be to see one of my own loved ones burning&#xD;
with pain, and so little relief as we can give them.&#xD;
All the comforts go with the ~orth!"&#xD;
"They have their own share," I answered "of&#xD;
sacrifices and privations, and we have our comforts,&#xD;
too; our soldiers are always with us. I doubt not&#xD;
there is many a heart aching in the North that would&#xD;
count it beyond all comfort to sit as we do by the&#xD;
side of soldiers fresh from the battle-field. If love, &amp;amp;r&#xD;
if distance will not let us do for those who are dear to&#xD;
us, we feel as if; in doing it for some brave comrade,&#xD;
we were doing for theme The Northern women have&#xD;
not these opportunities as we have."&#xD;
"Little do they care," she returned; "cold, sensi-&#xD;
bleimodel women as they are! There is too much&#xD;
knowledge of mathematics, of metaphysics, and of&#xD;
housekeeping crammed into them, to leave much room&#xD;
for tenderness or patriotism." -&#xD;
"I think," I replied, "the knowledge widens, not&#xD;
encumbers, the heart and mind. I know from that lit.&#xD;
tle sentence that~you have learned disgust for 6a8 11eu8,&#xD;
but is it quite fair to blame knowledge and education&#xD;
because they are badly used? For my part I have&#xD;

any right to abuse the talent because the woman Who&#xD;
has that which we have not should fail to possess that&#xD;
which we have? If a woman wills her household du-&#xD;

a choice which would not be ours, not for the power&#xD;
of making a choice. if I were an artist or a writer,&#xD;

* make my choice between my talent and 'household&#xD;
life. If I loved the talent best, I should never marry.&#xD;
If I did marry; I should use my talent only to enlarge&#xD;
my heart and fortify my common sense. It is true all&#xD;
women. do not see this thing as I do, and they decide&#xD;
to make household duties second; then they are&#xD;
blamed, are pronounced cold, as if mind and heart&#xD;
were always at odds. I have lived a great deal among&#xD;
~orthern women, of course, as I am from the North&#xD;
myselff and I cannot call them cold, or allow that their&#xD;
j~earts are not large and loving. I wonder if they are&#xD;
just to xis, oi~ if they blame our impulsiveness, our un-&#xD;

him up in steady faith, but it was of no use when&#xD;
he was tested. If anything happened to him, those&#xD;
* Northern women would treat him like a beggar, I&#xD;
suppose?"&#xD;
"Do not for a moment so wrong the North; let us&#xD;

are making the same mistake in regtird to the two&#xD;
sections. It is true we hear that prosperity and ease&#xD;
and luxury are with the North; but women, South or&#xD;
North, must have changed their nature if any luxury&#xD;
can steel their hearts against pain and suffering, and.&#xD;
and oh! the pain and suffering incurred for them!"&#xD;
"You are a Northern woman,-would you be just&#xD;
as kind if you believed. in the Northern side?"&#xD;
"Certainly, I should!"&#xD;
"You know the North. Perhaps you think I ought&#xD;
not to care what becomes of my boy, now that he has&#xD;
deserted us; but I cannot. He is my son, you know.&#xD;
I thought, when pleading failed, that I might frighten&#xD;
him; and I said, if he put on the Yankee uniform, I&#xD;
neyer wanted to see his face again; and oh, perhaps&#xD;
I never shall! Do you suppose he thought I meant&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Surely not," I answered, for maternal love and&#xD;
tenderness must have been ever imprinted unmistak-&#xD;
ably~ upon her sweet face. "It is from you he must&#xD;
have learned to follow his own convictions, at whatever&#xD;
cost, for you have shoWn him the example at a price&#xD;
which no man can ever wholly appreciate; he surely&#xD;
honors you for your steadfastness, though, doubtless, it&#xD;
seems to him blindness, and cuts him to the heart to&#xD;
remember; so you should honor him that he followed&#xD;
his coirvictions. You could not wish him to have yiel4.&#xD;
ed his principles either to your love or to your anger."'&#xD;

A STORY. OF OUR CIVIL WAR.    199&#xD;
&#xD;
*Principte8 I Do you suppose they realty think&#xD;
they are fighting for principles!" she exclaimed; and&#xD;
I was angrier then than when I tried to shut out the&#xD;
sounds of rejoicing over the Bull Run battle.&#xD;
"Madam," I said, "it is not difficult to imagine&#xD;
that a 'nation honorable, liberal, and prosperous, should&#xD;
fancy itself upholding a principle when it stands in&#xD;
arms for its government against its rebellious sub-&#xD;
jects."&#xD;
" That is their way of putting ~ she returned;&#xD;
"I suppose you understand the ~ro1Th better than I."&#xD;
"Oh! do not speak always as if it were the North&#xD;
we are warring against; we have made War upon the&#xD;
United AS~tates, and the United States, not N6rth,&#xD;
South, East, or West, has declared war against us."&#xD;
"North, South, East, or West," she replied ;~ "I&#xD;
hate them for taking my boy from me. I have never&#xD;
heard one word from him since Bull Run. I would&#xD;
give my life to hear of his safety."&#xD;
"May I ask his name?" I said. "I may some time&#xD;
chance to hear from or of him."&#xD;
"My son's name ?-~James Belton; he was a cap-&#xD;
tain in the old army when the war commenced."&#xD;
After that we were a longtime quiet. As I heard&#xD;
that name I seemed to see again the little group&#xD;
around the dinner-table, and my husband, flushed&#xD;
with enthusiasm, at its head; and again, pale and&#xD;
tired, as he was, when he lay back in his arm-chair&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7997-00000101"/>&#xD;
that night while I told him of Captain Belton's letter.&#xD;
And once more I thought, if I had argued and reasoned&#xD;
with him as I ought, he might have been, perhaps, safe&#xD;
to-day, or, at least, his name might have been enrolled&#xD;
among the defenders of that flag against which he had&#xD;
fought, but under the starry folds of which he now&#xD;
slept. I wondered, too, which had done right; the&#xD;
mother who,1 with breaking heart, had torn herself&#xD;
from her son to be true t&amp;amp; her convictions, or the wife&#xD;
who had been false to her convictions, lacking courage&#xD;
to leave her husband~ I walked, indeed, along a tan-&#xD;
gled path, hardly knowing if it were my own will to&#xD;
go forward; backward, or stand still; but somehow&#xD;
hoping to see that which seemed. all a tangle, all con-&#xD;
fusion, woven into a straight and meaning road.&#xD;
The Confederate soldier whom Mrs. Belton had left&#xD;
for a few moments, an hour after, called me to him.&#xD;
"I know about her son," he said; "his name was&#xD;
Belton, she said, dktn't she? You are sure sjhe said&#xD;
Belton,.-James J3elton? But I know it was the one;&#xD;
he was a colonel, and commanded a brigade. And this&#xD;
is his mother taking care of me like as if she was my&#xD;
own mother!"&#xD;
"What do yowknow about her son?" I asked.&#xD;
"I aren't tell you," he answered; "you will tell&#xD;
her, and she will never come near me after."&#xD;
~' I will not tell her anything you do not wish m~&#xD;
to.&#xD;

"I only done my duty," he told me; "when we&#xD;
goes to fight, fight we must, and done with it. I was&#xD;
in a company of sharpshooters, ma'am, and we set out&#xD;
to hit a man that Went. everywhere on a white.~...horse&#xD;
like as if the devil himself couldn't touch him, We&#xD;
used to call him 'the one-armed devil,' 'am. No~&#xD;
body thought I could do much; and says I to myself,&#xD;
'Just you hit the one-armed devil, Billy Sayres, and&#xD;
you'll be a big gun ever after.' I was sure I had him,&#xD;
when there was a crowd consulting together; but up&#xD;
rides another man and dashes by, all bright with tog-&#xD;
gery; nothing less than a General that time; I fired,&#xD;
and down he went; and when .1 fired again, the white&#xD;
horse was out of sight. But I just marked the place;&#xD;
for, says I to myself; 'I'll get a heap of things from&#xD;
him, and he deserves to lose them for spoiling my aim.'&#xD;
We made such a pile there, ma'am; wasn'tt much use&#xD;
to try to carry him oil', though he were Georgey B.&#xD;
himself; which -he wasn't, for no body 'ever knew that&#xD;
sharpshooter that ever had a sight of him. So, When&#xD;
night came, me and some others went around, and I&#xD;
found my man. Soon as ever I see him, I knew him&#xD;
for a General that once let my mother off down in the&#xD;
valley, and gave our folks a guard just as often as they&#xD;
asked. Mother was a regular Northerner, and this&#xD;
General or Colonel he knew it. I wanted- some clothes&#xD;
bad, but I hadn't the heart to take his. I was very&#xD;
proud to take down a General, for he acted like a Geu~&#xD;

eral, and there was heaps about him in the papers&#xD;
afterwards, but I kind of wished it hadn't been him.&#xD;
I thought maybe mothered like something that was&#xD;
his; she was so fond of him, she'd cook him pies, and&#xD;
loved him like as if he were a 'Rebel.' So I takes&#xD;
this note-book, ma'am; I haven't ever opened* it, I've&#xD;
just held on to it ~ll the time."&#xD;
Mrs. Belton had. put away his old clothes very&#xD;
nicely, as he now wore the hospital dress, and obeying&#xD;
hi~ directions I had little difficulty in finding a pack-&#xD;
age whichI gave to him. It was rolled in a very dirty&#xD;
newspaper, which the soldier unwound, although he&#xD;
was too weak to easily accomplish the unrolling. As~&#xD;
he attempted handing it me he dropped it, and the&#xD;
papers scattered around the floor and bed; I gathered&#xD;
them up hastily and replaced them. A carte do visit&#xD;
attracted my attention, for it laid face uppermost, and&#xD;
was one of a set I had had taken while at the North,&#xD;
the summer before the war. On the back of it was.&#xD;
written, "From Sr. .M L., Nov. 1861."&#xD;
It seemed natural to conclude it had been given&#xD;
him by some one of the Sisters at the conventwhere I&#xD;
had seen Emma Lewis, for I had left several there,&#xD;
and with real joy I felt I had lived in the grateful&#xD;
remei~ibrance of one man; one person had not met&#xD;
trouble and pain through me.&#xD;
"Will you take care of it~ ~a'am," asked the&#xD;
soldier, "and give it to her after I am gone? .Thrn't&#xD;
tell her who done it."&#xD;
&#xD;
Poor bright, little fellow, cheerful, grateful as he&#xD;
had been, interesting and winning us all, he lost his&#xD;
spirits after this; erysipelas came and could not be&#xD;
conquered; they took him to the Sisters' hospital,&#xD;
where there were more experienced nurses; Mrs.&#xD;
Belton still seeing him every day; but before either&#xD;
she or I knew he was really in danger he died. I had&#xD;
forgotten his name, which he had repeated in his&#xD;
story of Captain Belton's death, and could not recall&#xD;
it for a long time. I should have been glad to have&#xD;
seen or written to his mother, and regretted my own&#xD;
selfish preoccupation which had not anticipated this&#xD;
event. As all connected With him now comes back, I&#xD;
am reminded of some verses, I do not know by whom&#xD;
written, I have since seen, which are so suggestive of&#xD;
the many: scenes we saw and thoughts we felt in&#xD;
those bitter days, that I trust no apology is needed for&#xD;
copying them here:&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
THERE came a day when Gilbert' slept quietly, and&#xD;
the doctor, my young friend, said that when he awoke&#xD;
the fever would be gone.&#xD;
He slept on until it grew so dusky that he could&#xD;
not recognize me. I knew very well that I ought not&#xD;
to let him recognize me, nor let him know that I had&#xD;
been near him; yet it seemed very hard-you do not&#xD;
need that I should tell you how hard; but he was not&#xD;
~free, and every voice of duty, pride, and self-respect&#xD;
sternly demanded that I should ~do so. I hoped, as I&#xD;
sat in the dim light,, he would wake and speak in his&#xD;
natural voice again. It would seem like a dream of&#xD;
home,-and more. But it grew along late into the&#xD;
night, so late I ~ould not longer delay having' lights,&#xD;
and he still slept; so I forced myself from the seat at&#xD;
his side, and for the last time put the bottles in order,&#xD;
lowered the curtains, stood by him a moment, and then&#xD;
gave him into Mrs. ]3elton's charge.&#xD;
"I knew him once," I said to her, "and I do not,&#xD;
care to have him know that I have, seen him. Please&#xD;

avoid mentioning my name, or. saying any thing that&#xD;
will arouse lAs suspicions I will do 'as much as I can&#xD;
to avoid extra trouble to you; the only thing is, I do&#xD;
not wish to be seen by him.'~&#xD;
Day after day I prepared every delicacy I possibly&#xD;
could to send him, and every day I heard that he was&#xD;
slowly gaining strength. What wild, foolish things I&#xD;
did, it would be as foolish to name here; how I sent him&#xD;
soups 'and jellies in my finest silver and china dishes,&#xD;
'accompanied by flowers, and every fancy I c6uld&#xD;
devise to please his taste or tempt his appetite. I&#xD;
searched my library for the books I thought he would&#xD;
like best, and when they were returned, I cherished&#xD;
them for that they had been with him; but I kept my&#xD;
~resolution well, and did not once see him.&#xD;
The young surgeon and myself wer&amp;amp;now excellent&#xD;
friends; he had known my husband and many of my&#xD;
Southern friends well~ and besides being genial, lively,&#xD;
and warn-hearted by nature, was agreeable, accom-&#xD;
pUshed, and pleasing by cultivation.&#xD;
"Have you seen Mademoiselle 'GertruJe' lately?"&#xD;
he asked me, one day. "Her sweet face quite haunts&#xD;
me, and is evidently intended to exercise an extensive&#xD;
influence over my destiny. How eagerly, three years&#xD;
ago, I would have followed it ; ~but now I almost count&#xD;
it sin to think of any thing but those there," pointing&#xD;
to the~ hospital; "but-she had a lovely face t"&#xD;
"And ~a face however lovely, I ask as a matter of&#xD;
&#xD;
curiosity, can it inspire and sustain, for nearly six&#xD;
weeks, an" interest in the fickle heart of man?" I&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"For six times six weeks," he answered,' "when&#xD;
the face is as fair as hers!"&#xD;
"How very absurd! How very small the worth&#xD;
of a heart given to a face; to no sweetness ~of dis-&#xD;
position, to no brilliance of thought, or depth of char-&#xD;
acter, but simply to red cheeks and blue eyes! I.&#xD;
should be humbled so to make a conquest."&#xD;
"Then your pride has surely had many a fall.&#xD;
But' aertrude '-a romantic name, is it not ?-liut&#xD;
Gertrude, if' I read her face rightly, would have no&#xD;
such nice scruples, I fancy."&#xD;
"Well, fate seems to have decreed that you shall&#xD;
be interested in her, and will most likely bring you&#xD;
yet to her feet, and then we shall see."&#xD;
"Then we shall see! Haven't I won grace enough&#xD;
from you yet to secure an introduction?"&#xD;
"Ali I so I am to lay all this benevolent. assistanOe&#xD;

only for the fact that for fifteen minutes I once was&#xD;
seen talking~ with a 'lovely and accomplished female.'&#xD;
Verily, it is hard to say to which of us the fact is n~ost&#xD;

"You speak in jest, but your words have a world&#xD;
of meaning. It is one of the mysteries of life. That&#xD;
I 'honor and esteem you, that I bow down to you as&#xD;
to a noble and beautiful woman, and that it will be&#xD;
my pride' all my life to feel that I have been a co-&#xD;
laborer with one so earnest, and yet that all this&#xD;
talent and virtue gains ~additional light from a pair of&#xD;
blue eyes once seen, perhaps never to be seen again,&#xD;
is .a mystery which is so common one hardly notes it,&#xD;
and Which cannot be explained. Is it hunibling? I&#xD;
cannot feel it so., It is to me a proof of the wonderful&#xD;
power of the soul, that sees beyond our mortal vision,&#xD;
and recognizes-what?"&#xD;
"Sure enough, wAat? Neither you nor I can telL&#xD;
It may be a Joan of Arc, or a Lucrezia Borgia, though&#xD;
I hardly think it; it may be a St. Teresa or a Flora&#xD;
MacFlimsey for all either of us know."&#xD;
"It rouses my curiosity, and I mean to know."&#xD;
"That depends not upon yourself but on her will&#xD;
and. pleasure. We only know as much of each other&#xD;

shall know.~~&#xD;

"I do not know her myself. She chose to bridge.&#xD;

I never saw her but that once; do not even now know&#xD;
more of her name or address than that her father called&#xD;

"That is very bad. Is she a myth, think you, or&#xD;

"Nonsense! "&#xD;
"No, dreams."&#xD;

"That is consistent with your compliments! Good&#xD;

A slight, light-haired man in a colonel's uniform&#xD;
now became known to me in my walks. Once I ~met&#xD;
him face to face,, and he started and stared, and, I had&#xD;
the feeling, looked after me when I passed. He&#xD;
repeated this performance every time he met me,&#xD;
which was nearly every day. One morning, when I&#xD;
was a little later than usual, 12 found myself walking&#xD;
behind him. This time he was not alone; a slender&#xD;
young girl, dres8ed'in a very pretty summer suit, and&#xD;
a stylish "jockey hat," had his arm. I knew her at the&#xD;
first' turn of her head. It was "Gertrude." Without&#xD;
intending it, I followed them some distance, until I&#xD;
suddenly found we were at the depot. I turned back&#xD;
at once.&#xD;
I was, delayed a little by an old woman 'with a&#xD;

I bowed, and took a step or two toward her. She&#xD;
seemed embarrassed, but advanced a little.&#xD;
"Did you mind my rushing off so rudely that&#xD;
day?" ~he said, as if in order to say something "It&#xD;
was not right, when you had been so kind as to tell&#xD;
me. about the trains."&#xD;
~" I' should have been, very sorry to have had you&#xD;

father came."&#xD;
"Yes, poor papa!" she said, her tears bursting&#xD;
out afresh. "Now he is gone. He took his last walk&#xD;
with me this morning, just to show me how well he could&#xD;
bear it; but, in deed, he is not able to go yet. May I&#xD;
walk with you?" she added; "I do not know any one&#xD;
here that can understand how I feel to-day. I left&#xD;
~namma in hysterics. It makes me cross to have her&#xD;
feel so badly. When will it be over! Papa, poor&#xD;
papa! he went away so gloomy, although things look&#xD;
brighter that~ ever now.?'&#xD;
"21 am going up to the hospital," I answered. "I&#xD;
would like very much to have you go with me."&#xD;
"I would love to, dearly; but perhaps papa would&#xD;
not like it."&#xD;
"If you will trust to that instinctive knowledge&#xD;
which women generally have of each other, you may&#xD;
rely upon me to take care of you. I will not let you&#xD;
see any of the badly wounded men; we will pass&#xD;
through only oiie ward. I have some things to give&#xD;
one of the nurses."&#xD;
"I will go," ~he ans~ered. "I am not. afraid of&#xD;
anything that you are not."&#xD;
"Do you wish to see your mother first-will she be&#xD;

"Mamma ?-she would not mind if I stayed away&#xD;

spoke to us about you one day-some one who had&#xD;
known Major Aberthnay. I am so sorry for you?"&#xD;
As we walked and talked, her depression wore&#xD;
away; her nature was not one to retain any emotion&#xD;
for any length of time. I exerted myself to amuse her,&#xD;
trying the while to think whether I would. do well to&#xD;
meet my friend, Dr. Carr, at the same time that a&#xD;
thought was darting back and forth in my mind, what&#xD;
effect would it have if I were to lure her to my house,&#xD;
and let her see Gilbert?&#xD;
At the hospital door we met the doctor, and I&#xD;
observed with much amusement that he retained his&#xD;
color, and his composure under the unexpected gaze of*&#xD;
my companion's eyes. With the same politeness as&#xD;
usual, with perhaps a shade more of ceremony, he&#xD;
accompanied us into the hospital, and, when my visit&#xD;
to the ward was over, offei'ed to show us other parts&#xD;
of the building. Gertrude had told the simple truth,&#xD;
when ~he said she had learned the art of flirting; her&#xD;
eyes did the work of a dozen ordinary pairs that day..&#xD;
She despised the ordinary glances of surprise, dismay,&#xD;
and affected interest; she gave cool politeness to all&#xD;
the doctor's explanations, and attentive earnestness to&#xD;
my slightest remarJ~s; her blue eyes alternately fanned&#xD;
and kindled the doctor's already well-fired heart, while&#xD;
I watched the comedy with as much interest as one&#xD;
can who sees behind the acting..&#xD;

One thing and another detained me that morning,&#xD;
and when I reached home, Mrs. Belton met me with a&#xD;
serious face, and said:!&#xD;
"The soldier in your fr6nt room that we have&#xD;
taken care of so much, is a Yankee; they came for~&#xD;
him this morning, told me of it, and have taken him&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"Where?" I asked.&#xD;
"To the prison hospital,' I suppose," she answered.&#xD;
"If I had known he wa~ a Yankee, I could have asked&#xD;
'him about my son. Who would ever have thought it,-&#xD;
so gentlemanly, so polite, so intelligent, and a Yankee?'~&#xD;
"And he is gone!"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, he is gone. To think of his audacity,&#xD;

her to speak of her life at the Xorth; but my efi&#xD;

&#xD;
A thoroughbred coquette I knew her to be from&#xD;
the first; hut t was surprised to find that, young as&#xD;
she was, she had been several times engaged, and now&#xD;
wore upon her forefinger a brilliant diamond, whose&#xD;
giver she declared to be odious to her, but whose ring&#xD;
she wore because it was pretty.&#xD;
"Every thing he ever gave me," she said, "was on&#xD;
a ma~nilcent scale.' I believe I came nearer loving&#xD;
him than I ever did anybody."&#xD;
"Whowas~Iie'?"&#xD;
"My first love; I never told any one about him';'&#xD;
itis quite a romance; I ha a great. mind to tell you,&#xD;
if you promise beforehand never to tell any one, not&#xD;
to laugh at me, nor to blame Ine.7~ .&#xD;
"A womai~ will promise any thing to have her curi&#xD;
osity gratified. Let us hear the story."&#xD;
"I niu~t see you comfortably at your work first, for&#xD;
it is a. long story;' but it is quite a romance, I assure&#xD;
you; I mean to tell it to some authoress some day; it&#xD;
would sound so nicely, all worked up into a novel,&#xD;
with the fixings and framing they put in. Now I've&#xD;
said so much, you will expect it to be more than it is,&#xD;
and perhaps, after all, you won't think it interests&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Certainly I shall, and you can make it as long as&#xD;
you please, only don't interrupt yourself with apolo-&#xD;
gies, as you so often do, but tell the story straight on."&#xD;
For I had a way o~' thinking my owu thoughts while&#xD;
&#xD;
Gertie told her stories, and 'she never suspected that i:&#xD;
was not an attentive listener.&#xD;
"Well, you know, I went 'to school at Madame&#xD;
Chegary's; and, as I have told you, in spite of all her&#xD;
vigilance, remonstrances, and lectures, I did contrive&#xD;
to have a pretty good time, and one or two flirtations.&#xD;
I never did like tQ study, and was wild to go into&#xD;
society, so that one year I got papa to promise that&#xD;
I might leave school just as soonas I was sixteen, and&#xD;
papa never breaks a promise. When the day came,&#xD;
fbrI' knew papa would do as he said, I packed up my&#xD;
book, kissed the girls all around the school, and posi-&#xD;
tively refused to say any lessons. Every moment I&#xD;
expected papa to come 'for me, but half the day was&#xD;
spent in waiting before I heard a word, and ,then it&#xD;
was a note from mamma; she was at the St. Nicholas,&#xD;
--sick, of course; mamma's always sick,-where I was&#xD;
to join her, and wait for papa to meet us, as soon as&#xD;
lever he could get on. I did not like this much, I can&#xD;
tell you, for mamma always sticks close to her room,&#xD;
and to sing, or move, almost to breathe, sends her&#xD;
into hysterics; so, of course, I did not look forward to&#xD;
much pleasure.&#xD;
"Every day we expected .papa to come, and so I&#xD;
tried to be patient, and bear with. the best grace. I&#xD;
could the imprisonment in mamma's room,' which w~s&#xD;
w&amp;amp;rse than any thing at Nfadaine's'; but of course "I'&#xD;

hotel, with lots of fun going on everywhere, and not&#xD;
the gIimm~ring of a chance to join in it, beyond a lit..&#xD;
tie flirting now and then, in the passages, when I could&#xD;
escape from mamma. You look shocked; of course I&#xD;
would not do such things now; but that was ever so&#xD;
many years ago, and I was very young and very wild;&#xD;
and, you know, girls of sixteen very often do things&#xD;
they. blush to remember at twenty,-~-~we won't say&#xD;
twenty how much.&#xD;
"After a day or two I went around to see the&#xD;
girls; you may be sure I did not tell them what a&#xD;
stupid time I was having. I made a great deal of talk,&#xD;
as if I had been having a royal time. When they&#xD;
coaxed and teased me to go with them to a concert&#xD;
that -night, I pretended to consider, and finally said,&#xD;
if mamma had made no engagement for me I would.&#xD;
- Mammal had bought me some lovely new dresses, and&#xD;
just the dearest opera-hat in the world; th~re~s one thing&#xD;
I will say for mamma, she has perfect taste in dress.&#xD;
"When I got, home mamma told me I had had a&#xD;
call ~om some one who had not asked to see her; the&#xD;
card was around the room somewhere, she said. I&#xD;
went around hunting for it, mighty curious, you may&#xD;
well lielieve, to know who had called on me. It~asa&#xD;
gentleman's name, mamma condescended to remember. -&#xD;

&#xD;
had the impudence to call. This last supposition gave&#xD;
me a good fright. At last I found the card.7 It was&#xD;
a written card. I remember just how I felt when I&#xD;
read the name. Ifeigho! I have read -that name&#xD;
many times since! Well, on the back of the card was&#xD;
a note. I think I can remember it: -&#xD;
"'.211~, dear ill iss Vane,&#xD;
'Isaw your name in the l1~t of arrivals in last&#xD;

I am very much disappointed not to meet you, but&#xD;
will call again to-morrow. - if Ican be made useful,&#xD;
in .2Wr. Vane's absence, do not hesitate to command me.&#xD;

"Isn't it a romantic name? I thought so then&#xD;
and I think so now. I did not know the man from&#xD;
Adam. There was a horrible old fogy whom I used&#xD;
to know in-Virginia, by the name of Stuart, bu he&#xD;
couldn't have written such a note to save his life. It&#xD;
was such a round, full hand, yet so graceful and&#xD;
formed,-I will show you some time,-that I knew the&#xD;
man who wrote it must be nice; and I was mighty&#xD;
sorry I was not his Miss Vane, for of course, you&#xD;
know, the note had-been taken to the wrong room. I&#xD;
knew the little note all by heart before I could make&#xD;
up my mind to send it to the right Miss Vane, for you&#xD;
can imagine, in a life such. as mine had been, the least&#xD;
little --excitement was very welcome. At last; ho~~&#xD;

&#xD;
ever, I got my courage up, and sent the waiter with&#xD;
the little card to the other Miss Vane, while I sat&#xD;
wishing. I don't suppose women, like you, ever do&#xD;
such foolish things; but sillygiris, such as I expect&#xD;
always to be, do give way to such wishes sometimes.&#xD;
I sat wishing my time had come for gentlemen to send&#xD;
me dear little notes, and put themselves at my service,&#xD;
when back came the waiter. There wasn't any other&#xD;
Miss Vane, nor hadn't been any other Miss Vane, at&#xD;
the hotel. I took back the card, and had a great mind&#xD;
to let him call and see me before finding out his mis-&#xD;
taka; but I knew it would not do, so I wrote him a&#xD;
line, just as nicely as I could write, and told him the&#xD;
mistake he had made; before I had time to seal it the&#xD;
girls came, and I went to the concert.&#xD;
"Now if I hadn't been hurried off without sealing&#xD;
that letter what a difference there would have been in&#xD;
the lives of at least, two persons; for Lottie Ellis,&#xD;
who sat next me at the concert,-for which concert, be&#xD;
it known, we neither of us cared a rush,-Lottie Ellis&#xD;
somehow got out of me about the card, and as she is&#xD;
always ready for mischief, she said, 'Oh, I wouldn't do&#xD;
such a silly thing as to send it back. He may be some&#xD;
one who has been in love with you this ever so iong,&#xD;
who has taken this way for meeting you, and it is flying&#xD;
right in the face of destiny to do such a ridiculous&#xD;
thing; wait and see what comes of it. I :would act the&#xD;
real Miss Vane, if it so be that it is not you he means.'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"'How can I? he will know the difference the&#xD;
minute he sees me,' I said, 'and that will be to'&#xD;
morrow.'&#xD;
"'Oh, you goose!' said she, 'what need to let him&#xD;
see you? There are fifty places where you can be&#xD;
when he calls ;~ it isn't to be expected that you. can&#xD;
stay in all day to wait for him, and afterwards you&#xD;
can write a lovely little note of regret. You know&#xD;
you write the sweetest notes.'&#xD;
"'Oh! I would not dare,' I said, 'he would know&#xD;
it was not her writing.'&#xD;
"'Ten chances to one he has never seen her writ-.&#xD;
ing,' Lottie urged, 'and besides, ladies all write alike;&#xD;
you can write as if in a great hurry, and if it is very&#xD;
unlike her hand, and he knows it, he will lay it to that.&#xD;
But I believe you are the Miss Vane; he is some one&#xD;
who is in love with you, I know. I'll tell you; don't&#xD;
send the letter yet, and we can go to the parlor to-&#xD;
morrow and see him,-I can, not you, for the waiter&#xD;
would be sure to say there is Aliss T'~ine,-aud I will&#xD;
report what he looks like. You can give the waiter&#xD;
orders to say you are not at home.'&#xD;
"I consented to that, of course for there was noth-&#xD;
ing in doing that much, and the next day Lottie came&#xD;
bright and early, as glad of the fin, almost, as if she&#xD;
were the principal in it.&#xD;
"With the most exemplary patience she sat in&#xD;
first parlor and waited; with far less patience I sat&#xD;

up, stairs and waited. At last Lottie rushed up stairs&#xD;
almost outt of breath, and, as by good luck, mamma&#xD;
was all day too sick to rise, we had a grand talk.&#xD;
Lo1~tie was perfectly enchanted; she said he was hand-&#xD;
some as ~. prince, tall and splendkl a school-girl's beau&#xD;
ideal, tall and splendid and dark. No school-&#xD;
girl's hero ever had any but dark eyes and black hair,&#xD;
nor did he ever fail to be tall and splendid. 'Oh,&#xD;
he looked so disappointed!' Lottie told me; 'it was&#xD;
the richest fun ever was! I won't let you give it up&#xD;
now; I am just in love with him myself; and if I were&#xD;
in your place I would have him dead in love with me&#xD;
in a week. Now, I've got to go home soon,. and&#xD;
before I go I want to see your note written, fbr it&#xD;
wouldn't do not to write something. Evidently the&#xD;
man is in love with .A1188 Vane, whether Miss Vane&#xD;
means you or somebody else; just as evidently he is&#xD;
not engaged to her, or he would not call her. Miss; it&#xD;
is also very clear that he is on good terms with her;&#xD;
and if with so much knowledge to start with, you and&#xD;
I do not succeed in making a pretty big romance, we&#xD;
are not of much account.' We got pen, ink, and&#xD;
paper, and after much plotting and planning succeed-&#xD;
ed in getting up a very non-committal note; we 'did&#xD;
not know how soon Mr. Vane would be on,' were&#xD;
'sorry to have put him to the trouble of balling twice&#xD;
in vain,' would 'ask him to call that evening, but were*&#xD;

* "In the middle of the play that night at Wallack's,&#xD;
Lottie pressed my arm; directly opposite us, standing,&#xD;
was a man, the same, Lottie said, as he who had&#xD;
asked for me. Oh! but he was handsome! I would&#xD;
have risked a great deal more than I had risked to&#xD;
have such a man in love with me. Such fire, reserved&#xD;
fire, such quiet spirit, such force, such character in&#xD;
every look and gesture! I can't help liking him a&#xD;
little bit now, as I think of it. He was that kind of a&#xD;
man that if you once got in the way of caring for him,&#xD;
you could not get out of it; he would always sort of&#xD;
hold you, even after you had stopped loving him. I&#xD;
forgot to tell you he sent a most beautiful bouquet to&#xD;
me before it was time to go to the theatre, with a note&#xD;
thanking me for mine, telling me he had to start un-&#xD;
expectedly for Philadelphia, and if it 'would interest&#xD;
me he would like to give me the latest news from that&#xD;
quiet city. I deserve some compensation for my repeat-&#xD;
ed disappointments,' he wrote. This was just what&#xD;
Lottie and I most Wanted, and after I came from the&#xD;
theatre I answered his note, and gave him the desired&#xD;
permission. I told him I was very much bored in New&#xD;
York, that I had read all the books I could lay hands&#xD;
on, and written up. all my letters, and was very will-&#xD;
ing and glad to be amused. The first answer to my&#xD;
letter was a couple volumes of poems sent from Apple-&#xD;

tens', beautifully. bound; one was 'Idyls of the&#xD;
King' which had just come out, and the other the&#xD;
most complete volume of Whittier I had ever seen.&#xD;
'When he wrote me he spoke of them: 'He hoped,' he&#xD;
wrote, 'I. had not already read the Idyts of the King,&#xD;
for they would furnish me with dreaming for months&#xD;
to come; and as for Whittier-he knew I would find&#xD;
his poems always fresh.' 13~vidently he knew her taste&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"Evidently," I said, seeing, I was expected to say&#xD;
something.&#xD;
"It isn't to be supposed," she went on, "that I&#xD;
was very enthusiastic about that Quaker fanatic's&#xD;
poems, but his sending it proved to me. conclusively&#xD;
that he thought I was not I."&#xD;
"How could you doubt it?" I asked.&#xD;
"I don't know; men do all sorts of things if a&#xD;
pretty face strikes' their fancy. Well, to continue, or&#xD;
my story will never be finished. He wrote me often;&#xD;
Iwish I had his lettershere~ I am sure they would&#xD;
interest you; they r~early broke my heart to read and&#xD;
think they were not for me! Such witty letters, so&#xD;
entertaining, so sensible, with a sort of tender tone&#xD;
running all through them! What a woman she must&#xD;
have been to have inspired' such a man with such a&#xD;
devotion!"&#xD;
"How much easier than one less a man," I said,&#xD;
"it was because the man was himself so grind that he&#xD;
&#xD;
loved so grandly; ten times a better wox~an could not&#xD;
have inspired a lesser man with half such love. But&#xD;
go on."&#xD;
"In one of his letters he said: 'Hoping it will not&#xD;
be long before I shall see you in your summer home,&#xD;
I cannot wholly regret my disappointment in New&#xD;
York, since it was the cause of your melting in so far&#xD;
as to write me. That little card you sent me at the&#xD;
Everett House was the very first scrap of your writ-&#xD;
ing I had ever seen.' This encouraged me very.&#xD;
extensively, you may believe, and after that I wrote&#xD;
more carefully. I was always proud of my writing.&#xD;
I was very careful of the matter of my letter&amp;amp; as well,&#xD;
writing nothing of mamma, papa, nor any people I&#xD;
met, but of books, music, amusements, lectures that I&#xD;
read or heard, and considerably of my own feelings&#xD;
and thoughts. He opened his very soul to me."&#xD;
"Oh, b~oW could you 1" I interrupted; "it was a&#xD;
thousand times meaner than stealing or listening be~&#xD;
hind doors, this appropriating thoughts intended for&#xD;
another, this reading his heart !~"&#xD;
"You were not to blame me, Mrs. Abertlinay; that&#xD;
was in the bond. If you begin to blame me there will&#xD;
be no end to your indignation."&#xD;
"Then I will not," I said; "but tell me, what did&#xD;
you expect the man to think, of you when your-mi&amp;amp;.&#xD;
talce was to come to light, as come, of course, it must?"&#xD;

innocent! AB if there were not fifty ways of getting&#xD;
out of a wc~rse scrape than that! I had no fear but I&#xD;
should come out of it all right as far as his opinion&#xD;
went. My only fear was, what effect I should have&#xD;
upon his affections, for I loved him with all the ro-&#xD;
mance of a first love, and as I could never love any&#xD;
man whom I. met in the regular proper manner.&#xD;
Stolen fruit is always the sweetest, and there was&#xD;
never sweeter fruit than that I stole that 'winter. You&#xD;
must know, during the time I was writing, papa came&#xD;
on and had business in Washington, where he wanted&#xD;
to tate a house, but mamma would not listen to such&#xD;
a thing; so it was decided we should remain at the&#xD;
hotel, and papa come on when he could. As mamma&#xD;
generally keeps him in hot water when they are to-&#xD;
gether, I have no doubt he was very much relieved&#xD;
by the decision, except for me; but I was doing very.&#xD;
well. Several ladies had taken a fancy to me, and&#xD;
took me around; and as I was y9uug, wore pretty&#xD;
dresses, and reported,-as all Southern girls in the&#xD;
North are reported to be,-an heiress, I had beaux&#xD;
enough; and with pretty dresses and plenty of beaux&#xD;
a girl must be hard to please who cannot contrive&#xD;
to enjoy herself. Very often Mr. Stuart used to write&#xD;
about Mr. Vane, and. as it was just possible .M~'. Vane&#xD;
might not be Miss Vane's papa, I always spoke of him&#xD;
as Mr. Vane'; but fearing he might be a near relative,&#xD;
I put the Mr. Vane in quotation marks, and alliwent&#xD;

on unsuspiciously, and we were despei~tely in love&#xD;
with each other, when I 'received a hurried note: Mr.&#xD;
Stuart would be at the hotel the next morning. Wha~t&#xD;
the warrior feels when he hears the trumpet blast, and&#xD;
so on, felt little I, as the terrible crash was coming.&#xD;
By this time my impatience had grown so great that&#xD;
I had become almost unable to wait, for I felt I must&#xD;
have him securely mine beyond a doubt or fear, and&#xD;
the announcement that .1 was to see him came at the&#xD;
right moment.&#xD;
"I never before or since studied my toilet more&#xD;
than I did that morning, mamma helping me."'&#xD;
"That reminds me, what did your mamma think of&#xD;
all this proceeding?" I asked.&#xD;
"Mamma! As if I should tell mamma! Mamma&#xD;
would have afit at the mere suggestion of my writing to&#xD;
a man. I never even told Lottie Ellis half about it."&#xD;
"But how contrive to have your mother's assist-&#xD;

tiring with a sick headache to her room, after the ex-&#xD;

sure of myself that whatever I did it would be the&#xD;
best. I wonder if my heart will ever beat aga~as~t&#xD;

quoting Cherubina: my excitement only enhanced m~y&#xD;
1ove1ine&amp;amp;~. Shall I tell the rest in detail?"&#xD;
"Do not lose a word; I am intensely interested."&#xD;
"Thank you; you are real good. Well, I went to&#xD;
the parlor, in which the servant told me he was ; he&#xD;
stood at the door, more ;royal, more handsome, than&#xD;
the time i~ saw him before. He started as he saw me,-&#xD;
I know I looked well that day,-and stood back for me&#xD;
to pass. I gave him one clear, full glance, half search-&#xD;
iug,-for you know I was looking for my visitor,-as&#xD;
I went by him, and it did affect him."&#xD;
"I do not wonder," I said; "I have seen the effect&#xD;
of smaller glances on Dr. Carr. Go on."&#xD;
"Then I went into the parlor and looked around,&#xD;
and saw in the glass that his impatience for Mademoi-&#xD;
selle's appearance did not prevent his turning around&#xD;
to look at me. Ah! how many pillars of salt ther~&#xD;
would be, if all the world were punished like Lot's&#xD;
wife!"&#xD;
"They turn inwardly to sticks and stones, which&#xD;
is worse," I said. "Don't moralize; go on."&#xD;
"I went into the other parlors an~ came back and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
* looked at him, and half advanced; he looked at me,&#xD;
and there was ~some s~iow of intelligence in his face.&#xD;
At last I spoke timidly: 'I beg your pardon; is this,&#xD;
-I am sure it is ~ Stuart?'&#xD;
"'That is my name,' he said.&#xD;
"'Mr. Gilbert Stuart?' I asked; 'and you have just&#xD;
asked for Miss Vane?'&#xD;
"'Yes!' he said, starting into animation; 'yes! Is&#xD;
she not here?'&#xD;
"'This is a funny meeting,' I said, very cordially,&#xD;
laughing and holding out my hand, 'for two people&#xD;
who have been spoiling reams of paper for each other's&#xD;
benefit! I hardly suppose I ought to be surprised&#xD;
that you should not recognize me, for four years make&#xD;
a great difference at my age; but what have you done&#xD;
to yourself? You do not look the least in the world&#xD;
like yourself. Come to mamma's parlor.' Without&#xD;
giving him time to answer, I turned into the hall, and&#xD;
rattled all the way. 'I cannot tell you,-of course a&#xD;
lady is not expected to,----the pleasure I have had from&#xD;
your letters. I did not know you would take so much&#xD;
trouble for. poor little me, whom you. used to tease so&#xD;
4dreadfiully. Mamma will be so surprised to see you!&#xD;
she has a sick headache, however, as usual, and will&#xD;
* not be able to see you; but I shall tell her all about&#xD;
it.' Other things I said more tenderer, as the children&#xD;
say, and used my eyes with all my might. It was not&#xD;
hard to look delighted affection and childish happiness&#xD;
up to such a face as his.&#xD;

"I did not give him opportunity for a word until&#xD;
we were fairly in mamma's parlor, and then his turn&#xD;
came.&#xD;
"'I do not know what to say,' he began confu-&#xD;
sedly, 'I must shock and pain you. 1 am perfectly&#xD;
bewildered myself; for I am fairly in your parlor with-&#xD;
out having found voice to say you have made a mis-&#xD;
take. I am Mr. Stuart,'it is true, and you are Miss&#xD;
V~ne, I suppose.'&#xD;
"'Undoubtedly,' I said, with wondering eyes.&#xD;
"'The Miss Vane I asked for is another Mis&amp;amp;&#xD;
Vane.~&#xD;
"'What do you mean?' I said, 'are you not Gil-&#xD;
bert Stuart, who has been writing me from Philadel-&#xD;
phia, and sent me word he would be here to-day?'&#xD;
"'I am that Gilbert Stuart, but you-'&#xD;
"'Do you really think I am so altered?' I said,&#xD;
laughing heartily. 'Shall I have to wake up mamma&#xD;
to provemy identity? Mamma hasn't changed; she&#xD;
looks as she has done for ten years past, and as she&#xD;
will for ten years to come; and I, little Gertie, about&#xD;
up to .your knees the last time you ~w me, am her&#xD;
perfect image, people say!'&#xD;
"'My ilame is Gilbert Stuart.~ I have written to&#xD;
a Miss Vane all winter, and sent her word that I&#xD;
should meet her here; ~he may be in the parlor this&#xD;
very moment: it is a singular coincidence that you,&#xD;
too, should have had a Philadelphia correspondent of&#xD;
the same name.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"For answer, I took from my writing-desk a pack-&#xD;
age of letters.&#xD;
"'It. is a funny mistake,' I said, 'and a curious&#xD;
coincidence. .Afy Mr. Stuart wrote me,'-I took out&#xD;
his. last note,-' to expect him this morning; yourMiss&#xD;
Vane may, as you say, be waiting in the parlor for&#xD;
you. Afy Mr. Stuart will, without doubt, sc)on be&#xD;
there. I am sorry to have detained you. It is quite&#xD;
a Comedy of Errors. I must say, to explain it as far&#xD;
as I can, that the other Mr. Stuart is a very intimate&#xD;
family friend, whom I have not seen for so many years&#xD;
that I should not be certain of recognizing him; and&#xD;
although my remembrances of him are indistinct, they&#xD;
do not point out a man like you, but I allowed for&#xD;
time and the addition of whiskers!'&#xD;
"'Naturally,' he answered, 'but nothing. could&#xD;
prevent me from seeing that you and Miss Georgie&#xD;
Vane could never be the same.'&#xD;
"He bowed and was leaving the room, when, as&#xD;
letters will, my package broke the elastic that bound&#xD;
them, and two or three fell to the ground! he picked&#xD;
them up, and oh! but he grew pale!&#xD;
"'Another coincidence!' he exclaimed. 'I could&#xD;
swear to that's being my writing,' and he pointed to&#xD;
the address. I looked frightened, but answered light-&#xD;
ly, 'I wonder if your style is the same also.' I opened&#xD;
a letter and handed it to him.&#xD;
" 'I wrote that letter,' he said,' and this-audi this,'&#xD;
as I showed him others.&#xD;

"We were both pretty quiet for a while. At last&#xD;
he said, with the air of a man who gives up-&#xD;
"'All ~these letters were clearly written by the&#xD;
same person, and that person me. It all comes of my&#xD;
supposition. that there could be but one Miss Vane in&#xD;
the world. It. all comes from that! I have often&#xD;
thought the style of their answers was not like her&#xD;
character; but I supposed it to be because people&#xD;
often write so differently from the way they talk.&#xD;
They were beautiful letters, it is true. I seem selfish-&#xD;
this is a great disappointment to me.'&#xD;
"We had been sitting while examining the letters.&#xD;
He rose now, wearily enough; I folded and dropped my&#xD;
hands. I did not need to act much for my heart was&#xD;
really almost breaking. He saw the dejection of my&#xD;
attitude, and was moved with pity.&#xD;
"'This annoys you,' he began.&#xD;
"'Annoys me!' I repeated, 'it kills me.'&#xD;
"He came nearertome, 'I will myself bring you&#xD;
every line you have ever written me, if you will allow&#xD;
.me,' he said; 'it ought iiot to be necessary for me to&#xD;
say I will never speak of this uiistake,-this cruel&#xD;
rnis~ake,-to any one. I can never think of those beauti-&#xD;
ful letters, nor of this morning's meeting, but with the&#xD;
warmest admiration for their writer, and with the&#xD;
bitterest regret that, young as you are, you could not&#xD;
have been spared this mortification.'&#xD;
"'You are kind,' I answered; 'I do not think of&#xD;
&#xD;
the mortification. I found a man, and have lived&#xD;
months in the belief that-that there was something&#xD;
in life worth living for; it is hard that, young as I am,&#xD;
that belief should be taken from me.'&#xD;
"'Your friend Mr. Stuart-'&#xD;
"' I never cared for him; never even like&amp;amp; him,&#xD;
until his letters won my whole heart. I often wonder-&#xD;
ed how it could have been in him to write such letters;&#xD;
I might have known it was not.'~&#xD;
"'May be it is.'&#xD;
"' I know it is not. Good-bye, dear letters! Ah,&#xD;
Mr. Stuart, if you could have left me in my mistake!&#xD;
These were so much my own, I thought, these letters,&#xD;
and all the time 'they were not mine; I had no share&#xD;
inthem&#xD;
"'Do not say so,' he answered. 'Your letters&#xD;
have acted like inspiration to me.'&#xD;
"'You are kind,' I said; 'but nothing makes any&#xD;
difference now.'&#xD;
"'We have learned too much of each other,' he&#xD;
finally remarked, ~ for us ever to feel that we are&#xD;

of my letters that I venture to hope I may come some-&#xD;

"We talked over everybody we knew without&#xD;
any satisfactory result, until the idea struck me of&#xD;
looking over a card-basket. 'Here is an invitation to&#xD;
Mrs. Carter's for Friday,' I said, 'I wish you knew&#xD;

"I do not remember very much of what' foll~wed.&#xD;
I said something about. returning the books he had&#xD;
sent me, but he begged me to keep them, and I&#xD;
did.&#xD;
"I met him several times before the Friday of&#xD;
Mrs. Carter's reception came around, but we passed&#xD;
each other without recognition; I was fortunate&#xD;
enough to blush every time, and he was not perfectly&#xD;
self-composed. One day it was in a gallery of paint-&#xD;
ings; there was never a collection of paintings without&#xD;
containing at least one of A Y~un~, Girl'8 First Love.&#xD;
letter. There was one in this gallery, and a pretty&#xD;
picture it was. Mr. Stuart passed me while I was look-&#xD;
ing at it. I had the grace to color as I said, in so low&#xD;
a voice that I hardly knew if he understood me:&#xD;
.' There ought to be a compaAon picture called The&#xD;
.Mis~ake.' I did not look to see the effect of this&#xD;
&#xD;
speech, 'but hurried away, and waited. and hoped for&#xD;
Friday, with what patience I might&#xD;
"Friday night. came, and again with all my art, and&#xD;
all my mother's skill, I arrayed myself. It was at the&#xD;
time when we wore the most extensive crinolln~e, and&#xD;
the most abundant trimming, until women looked like&#xD;
dolls with their entire wardrobe on their backs. I&#xD;
had a silvery kind of dress, with tiny bouquets over&#xD;
it, a train, and a profusion of natural flowers. I did&#xD;
not go until very late; but, late as it was, I wa's there&#xD;
before Mr. Stuart. I cannot tell you how wide and&#xD;
empty that room looked to me, for my heart was wild&#xD;
with hope and fear, and love and terror, that night.&#xD;
At last he came, and leaning on his arm was a woman,&#xD;
dazzlingly lovely, a novelist would say, mighty pretty,~&#xD;
I must own. I rated inwardly, for it was easy&#xD;
enough to guess she was the other Miss Vane. I had&#xD;
hosts of beaux that night; Ihad saved several dances&#xD;
for him if he should ask, and I did my best to be&#xD;
admired that night. The time did come, although it&#xD;
had seemed as if'it never would, when Mrs. Carter&#xD;
came sailing toward me, and with her Mr. Stuart,&#xD;
whom, in due and proper form she presented to me.&#xD;
It would be some little time before I could dance with&#xD;
him, but' he waited, and entertained himself in the&#xD;
mean time with the lady he had brought, or who, per-&#xD;

"I cannot tell you how that evening went, nor the&#xD;

"One day he came with my letters, which had&#xD;
never got returned, and also with his adieux; he was&#xD;
going home to Massachusetts that day.&#xD;
"I said something about Miss Vane, which 'called&#xD;
forth this reply: 'You are very much mistaken in re~&#xD;
gard to my relations to Miss Vane. She is beautiful&#xD;
and winning; but her life is so joyous, her position so&#xD;
full of sunshine, that a man would commit a sacrilege&#xD;

have never spoken one word of more than ordinary&#xD;

Aberthnay, how much more that means which you&#xD;
leave unsaid than any thing you could say?&#xD;
"I cannot tell you how long we talked, nor at what&#xD;
particular point I covered my face with my hands, and&#xD;
let him guess that I cared for him. Nothing that he&#xD;
could say consoled me, and it was hard for him to&#xD;
&#xD;
leave me, feeling as I did. He talked a long time,&#xD;
kindly, tenderly, as a brother might have done, only a&#xD;
brother would have growled and called you a goose,&#xD;
-and finally rising, took my hand to say good-bye.&#xD;
It is very shocking; buti'm obliged to confess he took&#xD;
my hand, but deferred the good-bye; and before he&#xD;
got to the good-14'e, I had dried my tears, and with&#xD;
his arms around me saw his grand eyes looking down&#xD;
lovingly into mine. Even then I knew it was more a&#xD;
pitying tenderness than the devoted love he would&#xD;
have given the other that was mine; but I took gladly&#xD;
what I could get, and loped for more.&#xD;
"Mamma was quite satisfied, and planned half my&#xD;
trousseau, while he was telling her all that he would&#xD;
try to do for me. He wrote to papa, and papa pro-&#xD;
fessed himself satisfied if mamma and I were, and all&#xD;
went merry as a marriage belL"&#xD;
"This other Miss Vane," I said, "did she care&#xD;
much for him, do you think?"&#xD;
"I never~ thought about it, but I was frantically&#xD;
jealous of her. Well, we were engaged, and this is&#xD;
the diamond that sealed the engagement. You may&#xD;
think I was happy, for I loved him almost to madness,&#xD;
but I was not; I did ~iot fill his heart, and, that I did&#xD;
not, hurt and irritated me. After a time he went on&#xD;

is the man for whom I ~cared not the snap ~of my fin&#xD;

had been beguiled into an engagement irksome to me,&#xD;
and that my heart was his, as my hand would have&#xD;
been, could I have freed myself from my bond.&#xD;
"One of these men was Mr. Carter, with whom I&#xD;
one night went to a children's party, and came home&#xD;
about half-past nine. And when I came home there&#xD;
met me Gilbert; but Gilbert pale, thin, and stern. I&#xD;
suppose he was jealous; for, after some conversation,&#xD;
rather restrained on both sides, he said: 'Gertrude,&#xD;
do you think we love each other very much?'&#xD;
"' I don't know about you,' I said; 'I love every-&#xD;
body,-some more than others, though.'&#xD;
." 'And this Mr. Carter,-may I ask his degree?'&#xD;

you love Miss Georgie Vane.' I like a ftian to get&#xD;
jealous; you can manage him as easy as breathing,&#xD;
then.&#xD;
"'And if I should love Miss Georgie Vane with all&#xD;
my heart. and soul, in life and in death, her and her&#xD;
only, what would you say?' he exclaimed.&#xD;

plied promptly; 'a man whom both ought to scorn,&#xD;

each other. I know you have too mgch reasoir to&#xD;

"A great deal more he said; I cried, and he who.&#xD;
came, I am convinced, to make one desperate effort for&#xD;
his freedom, went away more firmly bound than ever."&#xD;
"How could you take love merely~as duty, or con-&#xD;
sent to be second where you should be 'first?" I&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"Because," ~ai4 Gertrude, "I loved him, as I have&#xD;
told ~you, :almost to madness, and I always thought he&#xD;
would end by loving me as I wished. Then, again, I&#xD;
hated Miss Georgie Vane, and was determined to hold&#xD;
him until, come what would, she should not have him;&#xD;
again, if there's any jilting to be done, it is the lady's&#xD;
privilege to make the first move; and although I should&#xD;
not have married him on his half-love I liked his at-&#xD;
tentio~ns, and I was resolved some day he should love&#xD;
me, and suffer for me.&#xD;
"In due course of time Miss Georgie Vane took unto&#xD;
herself a husband, Gilbert himself told me; and not&#xD;
long after that eveiit my father and Gilbert had a&#xD;
quarrel on politics, which fwmished me.with another&#xD;
excuse for delaying our marriage, which I meant&#xD;
should be delayed until he* fully loved me. tThen&#xD;
came the wait"&#xD;
"]~oes he love y~u: satisfactorily now?" I asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I neither know nor care. I would not marry&#xD;
him now for all the world~&#xD;
" Why not ? ".&#xD;
"He is a Yankee; you don't suppose I would&#xD;
marry a Yankee, do you?"&#xD;
"You would if you loved him."&#xD;
"If I married all the men I havebeen in love with&#xD;
I should have a pretty string of wedding-rings~ I&#xD;
never saw that man yet that I was fally willing to&#xD;
marry,-if I could get any one else. I don't want to&#xD;
be an old maid; nobody does. I like them all for a&#xD;
while; but it is a little while. The man that finally&#xD;
gets me. must court and marry me in a short space of&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"I will tell your next admirer of that little eccen-&#xD;
tricity of yours. What did this Mr. Stuart say when&#xD;
you announced your final intention?" -&#xD;
"I have never announced it. He will find it out&#xD;
sooner or later. I scorn any communication with a&#xD;
vile Yankee!"&#xD;
"Even so much as to return a Yankee's diamonds?"&#xD;
"I suppose you are right. If I know any one go-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
NOT two weeks after, Gertrude had another story&#xD;
to telL Dr. Carr's assiduous attentions had not been&#xD;
without their natural effect upon that young lady's&#xD;
impressible heart. She loved him, she said, as woman&#xD;
never loved before; and more to the same effect.&#xD;
"Before there was war," Gertrude informed me,&#xD;
"I always declared I would marry a doctor, for his is&#xD;
the noblest of professions. A man cannot be a good&#xD;
doctor without he loves his profession, and he cannot&#xD;
love his profession without loving and honoring hu-&#xD;
man nature-"&#xD;
"Hear! hear!" I interrupted; "Miss Gertie Vane&#xD;
on doctors."&#xD;
It is true," she returned; "I said so before I ever&#xD;
knew Dr. Carr. A good doctor is always a good hus-&#xD;
band; he appreciates us women, and our patience,&#xD;
energy, and 'resignation. That was before the war;&#xD;
8i~e 14~e war, it is, of course, every girl's ambition to&#xD;
marry a soldier. how mean will look the house,&#xD;
twenty years from now, in which there is neither flag,&#xD;

A STORY OF OUR CIVIL WAR.       243&#xD;
sword, nor musket! Few are so happy as I that I can&#xD;
unite my two ambitions, and marry a soldier doctor.&#xD;
But, Mrs. Aberthnay, dear Mrs. Aberthnay, what Aa~e&#xD;
I said?"&#xD;
For my face was burning, and for the first time&#xD;
since Carl's death tears came to my eyes. Oh! Ten-&#xD;
nyson knew well the true' life of this world when he&#xD;
summed up its miseries in that one sentence:&#xD;
"Lost to use, and name, and fame."&#xD;
Carl would not yet have been thirty years old&#xD;
and I was nearly five years younger, and what was&#xD;
there left of or for either of us? His enemies held&#xD;
his sword, and he could never fight it back. On the&#xD;
walls of my house, twenty years from now, there.&#xD;
would be neither flag, sword, nor musket. The right-&#xD;
ful doom of a traitor, you say. Oh! I implore you&#xD;
not; I go oii my knees to you,-say not that black&#xD;
word over my noble husband. Were he even that, you&#xD;
could wish him no worse doom than was already his-.&#xD;
"lost to use, and name, and fame." Put the harshest&#xD;
judgment on my actions, and give them their sternest&#xD;
sentence, and it would be a sentence no harder than&#xD;
that I was already bearing. All the labor without the&#xD;
fruit, all the battle without the victory, all the suffer-&#xD;
ing without the crown! "How mean," said Gertrude;&#xD;
"will look the house twenty years from now, in which&#xD;
there is neither flag, nor sword, nor ~m~sket?" AiPT&#xD;

&#xD;
that was to be the end of our house, his house and&#xD;
mine,-two noble names bound together,~~nd only&#xD;
shame their fruit, two weary, suffering lives, and their&#xD;
misery barren!&#xD;
Would it have been better had he lived? I say&#xD;
yes. Yes, I would rather point out to another genera-&#xD;
tion the flag, battle stained and conquered, that&#xD;
borne by a heart that, though erring, thought itself&#xD;
right, had sliced death though in a wrong cause, than&#xD;
the rarest frescoed walls free of any battle sign or&#xD;
trophy. For him who can live in the midst of heroic&#xD;
deeds, and not even think a courageous thought; for*&#xD;
him who can live surrounded by brave lives, and have&#xD;
no desire to emulate them; for him without the patriot-&#xD;
ism, the honor, or the manliness to decide and decid-&#xD;
ing .to act, there is a contempt such as no mortal can&#xD;
ever feel for a brave man, though brave for the wrong&#xD;
side.&#xD;
I did not tell Gertrude why I bent my head, and,&#xD;
startled by the suddenness of her remark, gave way&#xD;
to my sad thoughts, my life long desolation.&#xD;
When I again saw Dr. Carr I gave him a hint of&#xD;
Gertrude's little eccentricity; he took it very well,&#xD;
"Gertrude is a good girl," he said, "but as fickle as a&#xD;
May morning; but a firm hand and a kind rule will&#xD;
make all things right. I have seen just such girls,&#xD;
after breaking hearts by the score, 'settle down into&#xD;
l~he very cosiest and nicest of wives. Besides, Gertie is&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
so handsome, a man would risk considerable for&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"She is very lovely," I~ answered, "and most&#xD;
affectionate."&#xD;
"I have set you an excellent example," Dr. Carr&#xD;
said, "and been most obedient to all your hints and&#xD;
instructions. May I presume to interfere a little in&#xD;
your affairs? You are reputed a most loyal woman,&#xD;
and considered a model of patriotism; no one knowing&#xD;
your character at all could, for a moment, doubt that&#xD;
you would be both' loyal and devoted to any govern.&#xD;
ment were it that of Tippoo Sahib, or any other savage&#xD;
or tyrant known to the world. I do not think you&#xD;
change your convictions easily, I even think the force&#xD;
of habit is stronger with you than with almost any&#xD;
one I have ever met. Once your thoughts get in a&#xD;
'groove they will not be easily moved; that switch is&#xD;
not invented that will run you off the track. With&#xD;
this view of your character it is not strange, is it?&#xD;
that I should sometimes think your loyalty and your'&#xD;
patriotism are jifst where they were when ~ou lived&#xD;
in the shadow of Bunker Hill, and the Yankee Cradle&#xD;
of Liberty, Somebody's Hall."&#xD;
"Well?" I said.&#xD;
"If it were not so, it must, for many other ~reasons,&#xD;
~be lonely for you here in a country where you are&#xD;
almost a stranger, and entirely without relatives.' My&#xD;
little Gertie and I have talked it over often, and since&#xD;

&#xD;
Col. Vane's promotion, we think it would be quite&#xD;
easy for you to go back to the North, if you should&#xD;
desire it."&#xD;
"Dr. Carr," I answered, "with all my heart and&#xD;
soul' and mind and strength, I love, honor, and believe&#xD;
in the United States, and with all the strength of my&#xD;
soul I yearn to be there, but I doubt my right. I can&#xD;
do good here; I do not know that I can there. I do not&#xD;
deserve that I should be given that dearest wish of&#xD;
my heart. I refused the protection of the North when&#xD;
it was freely offered to me; have I a right to take it&#xD;
p&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
"If you talk of right and duty, and that sort of&#xD;
thing, why, I am vanquished at once. I have here a&#xD;
8afe pass to Gen. Vane's headquarters; you may take&#xD;
it. and use it if you will; if not, I will repeat the words&#xD;
you have just spoken. Gertie will swear to any thing&#xD;
I tell~ her, and you wilk be tried, convicted, and pun-&#xD;
ished a~ a traitor. You.may choose."&#xD;
"You are peremptory; a woman scorns to oppose&#xD;
force. I will go."&#xD;
I .had a call from Mrs. Vane, the first time I had&#xD;
ever met that interesting lady.&#xD;
She was in a state of perpetual flutter: "You have&#xD;
taken so much interest in Gertrude," she said, "and&#xD;
have been so very kind to her, that I quite feel as if&#xD;
you belonged to the family, and as if I could speak&#xD;
freely before you. I am quite Qpposed to Gertie's&#xD;
&#xD;
marrying the doctor. We have suffered a great deal&#xD;
from the war. All Mr. Vane's property is at the North,&#xD;
and would scarcely be available' even if there were no&#xD;
war, for there was a disagreement between 'Mr. Vane&#xD;
and his relatives. Indeed I might as well be frank&#xD;
with you. Mr. Vane was a widower when I married&#xD;
him. His former wife must have been a very peculiar~&#xD;
woman; at any 'rate, she was the cause of unpleasant&#xD;
feeling between Mr. Vane and his brother, and they&#xD;
have never been on good terms since, and none of his&#xD;
relatives will ever do any thing for Gertie, I feel con-&#xD;
vinced. Before the war Gertie wa's engaged to a very&#xD;
exemplary young man by the name of Stuart; he was&#xD;
very fond of her, and I am quite convinced will wait&#xD;
for her, and claim her when the war is over. I do&#xD;
entreat you to use your influence with Gertie,-she wrn&#xD;
do any thing for you,-to induce her to postpone her&#xD;
marriage, if she. will not break it off altogether; the&#xD;
doctor has nothing to live on, nor Gertie either, and&#xD;
every thing is so dear. I don't know how I can ever&#xD;
get her a proper trousseau. It will take nearly a year's&#xD;
pay to marry her as a daughter of mine' should be&#xD;
married. It is no use for me to say this to Gertie, she&#xD;
is so headstrong; she thinks sh&amp;amp; knows more than any&#xD;
one else. Mr. Stuart was rich, and, I suppose, still is&#xD;
wealthy, and is in every respect a better match for her."&#xD;
"But Gertie 'is so very Southern, I do not think&#xD;
she would be willing to marry a Union man."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
j "Fiddle-de-dee! Gertie talks very large but she&#xD;
does not care the worth of a, pin. iler father means&#xD;
she shall go North very soon; she will probably meet&#xD;
Mr. Stuart again, and every thing be settled. lie&#xD;
always liked Gertie more than she thought, but she&#xD;
plagued him terribly; they will both love each other&#xD;
better for the long separation.&#xD;
"And Dr. Carr?"&#xD;
*   "It is very easy for a woman of the world to see&#xD;
Dr. Carr is only attracted by Gertie's pretty face, and&#xD;
in six monti s they will be as indifferent to each other&#xD;
as if they. had never met. I am so used to Gertie's&#xD;
ways. The only man who could ever make any thing&#xD;
of her is Mr. Stuart, and I am persuaded that if they&#xD;
could meet again they would become very much&#xD;
attached to each other. Do persuade Gertie to wait&#xD;
a little. Oh! if she would only go North with you!"&#xD;
Mrs. Vane little knew what she asked of me! Just&#xD;
as every seemed clear between Gilbert and my-&#xD;
self, there came this new complication.&#xD;
"I will certainly speak to Gertie," I answered,&#xD;
"and ifshecan be indeed to go to New York, or North&#xD;
anywhere, I will take every ,~care of her; my house&#xD;
shall be her home, and I think myself that if she again&#xD;
meets Mr. Stuart their engagement will be renewed.&#xD;
I decidedly approve of its being broken first, and if&#xD;
renewed let it be at hi~ urgent solicitations. Let us not&#xD;
interfere, he will like her all the better, thinking he has&#xD;
lost her."&#xD;
&#xD;
One thing, however, I did intend; to make no&#xD;
foolish self-sacrifice for her sake. It should be a fair&#xD;
field, and no quarter between us.&#xD;
I found Gertie very willing to postpone her mar-&#xD;
riage. Nothing was said about her going North, but&#xD;
it was considered possible I might be able to send her&#xD;
a few things for her bridal toiette. She would wait a&#xD;
year for the possibility.&#xD;
Dr. Carr bore it better than I expected. "There&#xD;
is some thought of her being sent North," I said;&#xD;
"I cannot. promise you to keep her constant."&#xD;
"Do not try it, my dear Mrs. Aberthnay; I am&#xD;
already over the first heat of my love, for I am as in-&#xD;
constant as Gertie. If it ~8 to be, it will be,-if not,&#xD;
no fretting will make it better."&#xD;
"Will you take his letters back?" Gertie said to&#xD;
me. "I have addressed them; you can put them in&#xD;
the express at New York."&#xD;
"If it were not for Dr. Carr, I suppose you would&#xD;
come with me?"&#xD;
"I don't know; are they stupid there, do you sup-&#xD;
pose? I would like a little excitement."&#xD;
"I will keep a room ready for you," I answered,&#xD;
"any tim&amp;amp;$rou feel inclined to take a run up North&#xD;
I shall be overjoyed td see you."&#xD;
And so we separated.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIL&#xD;
I WAS received with great kindness by Gen. Vane,&#xD;
to whom Gertrude had written so much of me, he said,&#xD;
that he quite felt as if he knew me.&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you for your kindness&#xD;
to my little girl. There is a world of good in that&#xD;
light heart of hers if one only gets at it. Her mother,&#xD;
whc~ has not half her character, is* always in a fret&#xD;
about her. One of those unfortunate cases of a corn-&#xD;
plete misunderstanding between mother and daughter;&#xD;
another result of the abominable system of education&#xD;
which we admire ~o much in this country. I don't in&#xD;
the least doubt that there is a natural virtue called&#xD;
filial affection. It is equally undeniable that that af-&#xD;
fection, like all other affections; is keen-sighted and&#xD;
very jealous. It will not have its object less loved,&#xD;
less honored than others; and if that object fails to&#xD;
win the honor and love of others, or show itself wor-&#xD;
thy to gain that honor, it is very clear it will lose&#xD;
that which came to it naturally. Mrs. Vane was a&#xD;
brilliant woman when I married her. If Gertie had&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
&#xD;
known her then, she would have bent to her with per-&#xD;
fect docility, but, like all American women,-no, I&#xD;
* will make a few exceptions,-she allowed marriage to&#xD;
be the end of her life, when it is really the beginning&#xD;
of a woman's existence; all that goes before is but a&#xD;
preparation for this. When Gertie was old enough to&#xD;
find companionship with her mother,-when her mind&#xD;
was fresh, undisciplined, incomplete, but still a mind,&#xD;
what had her mother to offer? She had forgotten her&#xD;
Frenchshehadgivenuphermusicsheonlyreada&#xD;
few novels and the cookery-book,*~he had given up&#xD;
society and society graces, she had ceased taking in-&#xD;
terest in people; and what was Gertie to do? She&#xD;
snubbed her 'mother in a way at which I had to blush.&#xD;
She made no allowances; what child ever did? She&#xD;
Went her own way, and found con~'panionship where&#xD;
she could; and, disappointed in her mother's society,&#xD;
judged her deficient in every thing."&#xD;
"It is the story of a thousand others," I said.&#xD;
"I ought to make one exception," he added, "since&#xD;
you have seen so much of my family to make candor&#xD;
a necessity. Gertie bows down to her mother in one&#xD;
respect; in one thing she trusts her judgment im-&#xD;
plicitly,. that great and mighty theme of dress!"&#xD;
"It proves what could have been done if her re-&#xD;
spect could have been excited by other things. It is&#xD;
an old story, that no two people can meet a dozen&#xD;
times without discussing. I have great hopes that&#xD;

&#xD;
this war will make a change in this respect; there will&#xD;
be made so many sudden fortuues by the 'people,'&#xD;
that rank and position will cease to depend, as it. has&#xD;
hitherto, on wealth. Mind, character, and education&#xD;
will define station; men and women are learning now&#xD;
on how very little they can live comfortably, and the&#xD;
cares of luxury will no longer take precedence of&#xD;
every attainment; and women, relieved from the&#xD;
charge of* large establishments, will have~ more time&#xD;
and strength to be accomplished, intelligent, and&#xD;
good-tempered."&#xD;
"A dream of Utopia, my dear Madam. You have&#xD;
seen yourself that the love of display is as strong&#xD;
in the Southern cities as it ever has been, i~nd the only&#xD;
result of the much-vaunted economy of our women&#xD;
will be to . show them how much more they can 'do&#xD;
than they thought they could; and when the old order&#xD;
comes back, there will be this new order to double&#xD;
thejr burden. In the North, we hear, extravagance is&#xD;
.running riot."&#xD;
"But it will soon run its course," I said; "and I&#xD;
doubt not, women South and North will learn.to blush&#xD;
to go feasting in purple and fine linen, while every&#xD;
day new hearts are sitting desolate in their mourning.&#xD;
Mrs. Vane tells me there is some prospect that Gertie&#xD;
will go to New York. I shall be most happy to re-&#xD;
ceive her if~you will let her come to me, and perhaps&#xD;
we two may do each other good."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You go back to ~your parents, I suppose?"&#xD;
"I have none; my mother died before I can re-&#xD;
member, and of my father I know only that he seems&#xD;
to have forgotten my existence. My uncle, who took&#xD;
me as his own child when my mother died, has ever&#xD;
been tenderness and generosity itself in my regard."&#xD;
"If; instead of that black dress, and wearing your&#xD;
hair tight under that widow's cap, you were dressed&#xD;
in brilliant colors, with your hair arranged as it was&#xD;
worn twenty-five years ago, you would be a living&#xD;
portrait of some one I once knew."&#xD;
"I shall never have the heart to wear brilliant&#xD;
colors again, for the reason~ that I have left my girl-&#xD;
hood and my wealth behind me; still if; after the war&#xD;
is over, you will allow me to thank you in my own&#xD;
home for enabling me to reach it, and if it would be&#xD;
a pleasant picture, I should be glad to array myself to&#xD;
please you.~~&#xD;
"It would not be a pleasant picture," he answered&#xD;
abruptly. "May I ask your maiden name?"&#xD;
"Georgie Vane"&#xD;
"I supposed so. If you have not had your sus-&#xD;

pleasure to give. I have never sat in judgment upon&#xD;

fully meted out to you, insomuch that, having once&#xD;

"And you, sir, were we to meet as simply friends,&#xD;
would soon win my admiration. I make no claims to&#xD;
any especial tenderness for you; if I judge you ever,&#xD;
~judge you as a man, not as my father, or my mother's&#xD;
unappreciative husband."&#xD;
"You are very kind! Perhaps we may meet some&#xD;
time again, for I do claim especial tenderness for you;&#xD;
I do claim the warmest feeling of my life for you; and&#xD;
as I never longed for love even from my first love,&#xD;
&#xD;
youi' mother, I do yearn for a kinder feeling from&#xD;
yoU.&#xD;
"You must win it, then, sir; for it is absolutely&#xD;
not in my power to give it otherwise. Filial affection,&#xD;
you said not an hour ago, was a natural virtue-; it is&#xD;
dead in my heart.; but there is room above its grave&#xD;
for the growth of a vigorous affection, I assure you."&#xD;
"If there is any thing left of me, body or soul,&#xD;
when this war is over, I shall try to plant something&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"Yet coldly as I have spoken, sir, do not think it&#xD;
is nothing to me that I have found a father. I thought&#xD;
my life was dead since it had lived in vain. My hus~&#xD;
band, as you know, died a prisoner; my uncle is o14&#xD;
and not married, and is lately rendered quite infirm by&#xD;
a fall from a horse, from which he can never fully re-&#xD;
cover; there is no one to l'ay up honor for my name&#xD;
when this war has' passed; there is no name, a name&#xD;
of use and fame, to which I can point, and say I was&#xD;
something to him."&#xD;
"I understand you. But you are yet only a girl;&#xD;
your beauty is not yet at its height; you can and I&#xD;
hope will marry again, and this time let it be to some&#xD;
soldier who will hang the Federal flag over the black&#xD;
stain of a rebellious husband and a traitor father."&#xD;
I flushed a little; but I only answered by speak-&#xD;
ing of Gertie. "If she comes North she will come to&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

"I thank you," he said stiffly; "I prefer she should&#xD;
go to her mother's relatives. It is ~iow time for me to&#xD;
leave you; I think you understand precisely every&#xD;
thing that you have to do. I do not believe you will&#xD;
have any difficulties of moment; I will attend to Ma.&#xD;
jor Aberthnay's property, and hope I shall be able to&#xD;
preserve it for you." He paused a moment, then took&#xD;
out his watch, a magnificent one. "It is scarcely fit&#xD;
for a lady's use," he continued'; "but I doubt not your&#xD;
uncle, who seems to have transferred,.-i will not&#xD;
make you angry, so no matter,-1 am poor in memen.&#xD;
toes now, but I pray you accept this as a pledge of&#xD;
remembrance, or a~ any thing you choose. I presume&#xD;
it would be asking toQ much grace to request a line&#xD;

" Should I find an 'opportunity to send you I will&#xD;

Then David and I turned our hacks on the land of&#xD;
the South, and with our faces N~orthward hurried on&#xD;
our way.&#xD;

CHAPTER xxIII.&#xD;
I COULD not pass further on ~until I had seen my&#xD;
husband's grave. It delayed me some weeks, but the&#xD;
force of a strong will is invincible. I went at even-&#xD;
ing, during a September storm, for there was such&#xD;
confusion and fear on every hand that I did not dare&#xD;
risk an hour in going. Evening settled into darkness&#xD;
and night, while David and a guide we had with great&#xD;
difficulty procured, searched, and at last found it. By&#xD;
the light of their lanterns I read the rough inscription&#xD;
on the wooden slab:&#xD;
"- ABERTHNAY, C. S. A.&#xD;
Died - 1862."&#xD;
I sent the men back to a house near at hand, while&#xD;
I stayed and kept one night's watch over that lonely,&#xD;
almost nameless and never honored grave, over which&#xD;
had passed and repassed the trampling feet of broken&#xD;
and routed armies.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
AT New York I sent the parcel of Gilbert Stuart's&#xD;
letters which Gertrude had confided to my care, her&#xD;
engagement ring, and his presents, back to him~ ac-&#xD;
cording to her instructions, and in such a manner that&#xD;
he would not be likely to connect the sending of them&#xD;
with my return.&#xD;
I say nothing of the feelings with which I took&#xD;
the cars for home, for glorious old Massachusetts's truly&#xD;
sacred soil. I dared not thinkwhat changes had come&#xD;
to that home. Yet there seemed little change around.&#xD;
Broadway was as crowded, its windows as richly&#xD;
filled as when I drove down in the carriage with half-&#xD;
closed curtains with Carl.&#xD;
Here and there I had met a soldier, and was re-&#xD;
minded that there was really war in the land. Officers&#xD;
I saw in abundance, in fresh new uniforms, as if out&#xD;
for a holiday, and with them often stylishly dressed&#xD;
ladies looking proud and happy.&#xD;
It was a glorious day in early autumn, and a&#xD;
brilliant October sun gilded the old familiar words,&#xD;
&#xD;
which I think I shall never see without a heart-bound:&#xD;
"New York anJ Boston Express Line." October has~;&#xD;
always been called my month, typical of me in my old&#xD;
days of joy and happiness, and I hailed it as a good&#xD;
omen that its beautifully blue skies guided me&#xD;
home.&#xD;
Do we really, think on days like this I am chron-&#xD;
icling,-days when all our days seem to have culmi-&#xD;
nated in one, and all our lives pass in review before us?&#xD;
Back came the days when Carl and Uncle Tom would&#xD;
put me in the cars or meet me coming, when Carl's&#xD;
face would flush, and his eager eyes single me from&#xD;
the crowd, and joyously look dowii7 their greeting;&#xD;
over again I lived the alternate joy and pain of our&#xD;
intercourse,'~my own hardness and his wistful pleading,&#xD;
and now love or coldness availed him nothing.&#xD;
Nearer, nearer flew the train, and a~t last the&#xD;
blessed Massachusetts breeze, the loyal Massachusetts&#xD;
breeze that no traitor-breath had ever tainted, blew&#xD;
glad welcome in my Lace. I forgot the widow's cap,&#xD;
and with all the buoyancy of youth and happiness&#xD;
bent forward to answer its greeting.' If the calm,~&#xD;
stolid travellers around me were astonished to see the&#xD;
stern-seeming widow flush up into animation and ex-&#xD;
citement, it mattered little to me. Ab! how truly I&#xD;
felt in the words of one of my favorite poets, Adrien&#xD;
Rouquette:&#xD;
"L'air de notrepatrie e.st le soul air vital."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7997-00000131"/>&#xD;
260              AT ANCHOR:&#xD;
&#xD;
And now the "iron horse" hurried on, rattling over&#xD;
the well-known bridge, crossing, the narrow river&#xD;
where I had so often been boating for pond lilies ;&#xD;
running on with its joyous tidings to the grand old&#xD;
forests with their fullest splendor of purple and gold,&#xD;
and brown and scarlet; screaming through* the little&#xD;
towns, nests of cottages shining now in sunset beauty;&#xD;
winding around the soft green hills, lighted by flam-&#xD;
ing autumn berries; dashing through fields thick with&#xD;
heavily-laden trees of fruit; out again into the sunlit&#xD;
town, and now slower auid slower, for the end is near.&#xD;
TheI~e was no carriage with its prancing horses, no&#xD;
Uncle Tom with his bluff "Well, old lady!" to meet&#xD;
me as I sprang from the train, and burning with im-&#xD;
patience turned into the grassy lane, where silence&#xD;
and solitude walked with me. Silence and solitude&#xD;
followed me into the narrow street, through the old&#xD;
brown gate, under the arching elms, up to the vine-&#xD;
wreathed porch, past the half-open door into the&#xD;
diamond-%Ioored halL                         /&#xD;
Like pilgrim, at the shrine I could have kissed the&#xD;
cold marble; but my joy and impatience hurried me&#xD;
~n to surprise those who counted me as almost of the&#xD;
dead. A long loose circular of ~y favorite scarlet&#xD;
hung in the hail; I wrapped it around me to cover the&#xD;
black dress, and laid my own sombre wrappings, even&#xD;
my widow's cap, aside.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
I Z~w it was probably their hour for tea, and I&#xD;
hurried into the library separated by glass doors from&#xD;
the dining-room. At the table, as I could see through.&#xD;
these doors, were seated three persons. Facing me sat&#xD;
my Uncle Tom,-my Uncle Tom, with eye-glasses on&#xD;
before folk! Opposite him was a lady, whom I easily&#xD;
conjectured to be Kate; between them a young man in&#xD;
an officer's uniform.&#xD;
Uncle Tom looked up suddenly;* "Kate," he said,&#xD;
"there ~ some one in the library."&#xD;
I sprang into a corner.&#xD;
"I guess not," answered Kate, turning round.&#xD;
"I tell you there is, or was,'? he persisted; "I saw&#xD;
something red by the doors."&#xD;
"Probably the light througli the curtains,"&#xD;
Kate answered; "'we are having gorgeous sunsets&#xD;
now.',&#xD;
"I move we make a search after tea," the officer&#xD;
remarked.&#xD;
"Kate," my uncle said, "what do you do to the&#xD;

&#xD;
tea; it does not taste like tea. I have not had a de-&#xD;
cent cup of tea since poor Georgie went away."&#xD;
The glass doors slid back at a touch: "Let me,&#xD;
uncle," I said, as quietly as if I had not been away a&#xD;
week.&#xD;
My uncle sat as if paralyzed, his eyes dilating as&#xD;
he stared at me.&#xD;
1~ate, more practical, rushed to me. "Why, Georgie&#xD;
Vane," she exclaimed," what a way to surprise people!&#xD;
I feel as if I had seen a ghost, and in my cloak, too!&#xD;
Are you real?"&#xD;
~"Georgie!" my uncle said, faintly, in a tone be-&#xD;
tween an exclamation and an interrogation, " My&#xD;
Georgie?"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle," kissing him.&#xD;
"My own, own Georgie ?-my pet, my darling, my&#xD;
old lady really?"&#xD;
"Yes, uncle."&#xD;
"I can hardly be1iev~ it," interposed Kate; "I am&#xD;
sure I am as white as w sheet. There never was such&#xD;
a surprise! How did you get here? If you had sent&#xD;
us word so we could have had the carriage."&#xD;
"I could not have kept quiet in a carriage!" I an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
"It is really you, Georgie?" again asked my uncle.&#xD;
"As sure as can be," I answered4&#xD;
"Well, go there and. make me a cup of tea," he&#xD;
ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Before I abdicate,", said Kate, "let me introduce&#xD;
Captain Lewis; my cousin, Mrs. Aberthnay, just from&#xD;
the land of secesh."&#xD;
Captain Lewis arose and bowed, but he could not&#xD;
let down his eyelids.&#xD;
I made my uncle's tea under a rattling fire of ques-&#xD;
tions from Kate.&#xD;
My uncle tasted his tea. "It is Georgie," he said,&#xD;
and* rising, rang the bell violently.&#xD;
"Here, all you people!" he cried, as every one in&#xD;
the house rushed to see what was the matter; "here,&#xD;
all you people! rejoice and make merry, and kill the&#xD;
fatted calf, for she that was lost is found."&#xD;
Every one who had ever seen or heard of "Miss&#xD;
Georgie," headed by Mrs. Glynn, now gathered around&#xD;
me, for in five minutes' time I had succeeded in setting&#xD;
my uncle's usually quiet mansion into a terrific uproar.&#xD;
Some hurried me up-stairs and pushed me on a lounge;&#xD;
one unlaced my boots, one pulled down my hair, an-&#xD;
other disencumbered me of my heavy dress, while&#xD;
another stood ready to envelop me ia one of my old&#xD;
wrappers that Mrs Glynn kept as sacredly as relics.&#xD;
They washed my face and combed my hair as if I had&#xD;
just been brought in from the dirt, and with a z~eal&#xD;
not complimentary to Secessia.&#xD;
As soon as I was considered clean enough I was&#xD;
permitted to descend to the dining-room, where there&#xD;
was a scene I shall never remember without laughing&#xD;

&#xD;
and crying together. While the women were employ-&#xD;
ed with me, Uncle Tom had not been idle. I had told&#xD;
Davi4 to wait half an hour at the station, and then&#xD;
find his way t&amp;amp; the "big brown house with the cupo-&#xD;
la," which we could see from the railroad depot; for&#xD;
I wished to make my entrance unattended. His half&#xD;
hour had been a short one, or he had taken a "short&#xD;
cut," for very soon my uncle's quick ears had caught&#xD;
the sound of boots on the gravelled pathway, and&#xD;
David w&#xD;
as at once hailed and pressed into my uncle's&#xD;
service, as the young officer had been. * In order to en-&#xD;
large the table they had taken off the tea-things, and,&#xD;
'manlike, piled them in a corner. With another le~if in&#xD;
the table the cloth proved too short, but they had&#xD;
concealed, as they supposed, the discrepancy by the&#xD;
tea-tray; th~y had piled upon the table every article&#xD;
of fodd to be fbund in 'garret, cellar, kitchen, or or-&#xD;
chard, and with a consideration natural to him, my&#xD;
uncle had given David to eat of the leg of a chicken,&#xD;
but not the usual facilities for disposing of the luxuri-&#xD;
enS drumstick.&#xD;
The picture that presented itself to my view as I&#xD;
reached the door ~f) the dining-room, was a ludicrous&#xD;
one. My uncle, with his face very red, was pulling&#xD;
very hard at a stubborn cork, in a bottle of his rarest&#xD;
wine. Captain Lewis, with coat-sleeves daintily rolled&#xD;
back, and looking very much disgusted, was trying to&#xD;
find place for a dish of jelly; an4 David, on a broad&#xD;

&#xD;
grin, with teeth and one hand kept tight hold of the&#xD;
drum-stick, while with the other hand and one knee he&#xD;
was upholding a dish of' meat, apparently waiting for&#xD;
the Captain to find room for it.&#xD;
One would have imagined all ~Secessia was in a&#xD;
starving condition; and I, as their representative, was&#xD;
expected to eat enough for all.&#xD;
"But, bless his heart!" as Mrs. Glynn privately&#xD;
inforixied me, "he'd die, master would, if he couldn't&#xD;
do something for you."&#xD;
And so I sat down. and was waited on. I refused&#xD;
not to "make an effort" at every thing he piled upon&#xD;
my plate.&#xD;
Kate and the captain sat side by side, and made&#xD;
low-toned comments; and when, at last, If was consid-&#xD;
ered to have eaten enough, and we had adjourned to&#xD;
the parlor for a good talk, Captain Lewis opened his&#xD;
mouth and spake:&#xD;
"What do you think of our prosperity, Mrs Ab-&#xD;
ertlinay? Does it not greatly surprise you? I wish&#xD;
you could tell your rebel friends of our abundance. A&#xD;
large number of us are in favor of starving the~n out.&#xD;
I presume you have seen terrible destitution there?"&#xD;
And I answered, "You of the  ~orth and they of&#xD;
the South seem to know about as much of each other&#xD;
as you~ do of the Kamtschatkans."&#xD;
"Do you~ mean they ar~ not on the verge of starve~&#xD;
tion?" said he,&#xD;

&#xD;
"I 4o," said I; "and I mean more. You must&#xD;
fight them in earnest, in fair and open fight, if you&#xD;
wish to conquer them."&#xD;
This was all I ever told of my experience in the&#xD;
South.&#xD;
When David had been feasted and lionized in the&#xD;
kitchen, I saw him to give him some orders.&#xD;
"Dis berry grand place," he ~volunteered; "dey's&#xD;

CHAPTER xxvI.&#xD;
.A~rn so I was home again,-home in all the dear&#xD;
old places, and scarcely able to realize such tempests&#xD;
of sorrow had swept over me, except, perhaps, by the&#xD;
calm they had left.&#xD;
Nearly all our young gentlemen friends with whom&#xD;
we had been boating, ridingpicnicing, and dancing,&#xD;
were off to the war; many had been killed, some were&#xD;
maimed tbr life; scarcely a dwelling in the land that&#xD;
had not been under the shadow of death. N"ot a&#xD;
dwelling in the land, thought I, but has hopes to have&#xD;
a flag, or sword, or musket to show when this war&#xD;
shall bea page in history.&#xD;
Gilbert Stuart, Kate said, had been among the&#xD;
first to leave. He had gone first as a private in The&#xD;
old Sixth,-the immortal Sixth, whose blood stands re&#xD;
cored against the city of Baltimore,-a record which&#xD;
tears and blood such as no city~ has yet shed, can ever&#xD;
wholly wipe away. i Gilbert was an officer now, Kate&#xD;
thought, though she knew but little of him lately.&#xD;

&#xD;
guish~d officers now; and young girls then, like me,&#xD;
were widows now.&#xD;
Crowds besieged me, for I was a wonder. I had&#xD;
come from Richmond; I knew all about the rebel&#xD;
army and all about the rebel politics. I was pestered&#xD;
with questions, but I told nothing. What right had&#xD;
I to tell? The South had trusted me; and I could&#xD;
not betray the trust. They hinted that I seemed half&#xD;
secessionist, lut in time they found that I was stronger&#xD;
Union than many of them.&#xD;
Many weeks passed and stretched away into&#xD;
months. I had become quietly domesticated at home&#xD;
again, wondering sometimes what had become of Mr.&#xD;
Stuart. Had he died in the prison hospital, or escaped&#xD;
death that time 'to meet it on some battlefield? Who&#xD;
could 'tell me? I had thought I should hear from&#xD;
him after his reception of his le1~ters, for1 Gertrude had&#xD;
requested him to give the ring to me, if not fr6m him-&#xD;
self as from her; and, if alive, he had ample time to&#xD;
have heard of my return from the South, for it had&#xD;
been talked of far and wide.&#xD;
Perhaps he did not think me Worthy .of the ring&#xD;
now. Something of the same* spirit which had moved&#xD;
Gertrude, when she said, "I meant he should love mC&#xD;
and ~uI~r for me some time," arose in my heart.'&#xD;
One night a gentleman did call to see me, and in&#xD;
the ~self~saine room where I had so often dressed to&#xD;
meet bium. I re~d his ear4,&#xD;
&#xD;
The Captain's unifi~rm to which he hal now tisen,'&#xD;
became him well; manly, and stately, and ~stern he.&#xD;
was now,---a man whose voice might make regiments&#xD;
start and tremble, if raised in command, and, if low-&#xD;
ered to tones of sweet persuasion, might win the&#xD;
hardest heart.&#xD;
Haughty, stern, and impatient now, where he had&#xD;
before been easy tempered and too patient, I won~&#xD;
dered had Gertrude or I, or neither of us, the most to&#xD;
do with this change.&#xD;
"I learned only a few days ago that you' were&#xD;
'here," he' said, in rich but rather ceremonious tones:&#xD;
"I have been home on sick leave; home now means&#xD;
New York; my parents are I ~but my 'sister is&#xD;
married and living here. I am glad to see you safely&#xD;
in your old home. It will be to remain until the war&#xD;
is over, I trust ?"&#xD;
"I expect it to) be my home for the rest of my llii~,"&#xD;
I answered; "I have left many pleasant friends be-&#xD;

there will be as free communication between us as&#xD;
there was formerly.&#xD;

"Was that in Richmond?" I asked, rest rained by&#xD;
his distant manner from saying more.&#xD;
"Yes, and at~ the very time when Richmond was&#xD;
in its greatest panic. it was a fortunate thing for me;'&#xD;
for Union prisoners, men of health and vigor, are con-&#xD;
stantly dying under the Won hand of their captors,&#xD;
and I could not have hoped for any care in the prison."&#xD;
"Yet they try to give it?"&#xD;
"Officers do,~ gentlemen are gentlemen all the&#xD;
world over,-and a being with a spark of manhood,&#xD;
courtesy, or of courage, would scorn to taunt a cap-&#xD;
tive, and would always be tender to a wounded sol-&#xD;

"These things must be hard to bear?"&#xD;
"The are terrible. To~hear their taunts and&#xD;
sneers, and feel your blood boiling, and not be able to&#xD;

"Don't speak of it," I saidl; "I cannot forgive&#xD;
them, but I would like to forget it."&#xD;

"Did you? I had forgotten."&#xD;

witty Father of his Country?"&#xD;
"I assure you not," I replied. "It was for the&#xD;

I am doubtful yet," he said; "but perhaps 'your&#xD;

"But what," I asked, "will redeem the fact?"&#xD;
"That is disrespectful to my commander-in-chief.&#xD;
Is not this a free cotintry, and shall he not have his&#xD;

"I submit," I answered; "but thftt is quite enough&#xD;

"The 'brave old knightly band,' I wish I could."&#xD;
'KNo knight ever fought in a better cause," I an-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
M~ life was a weary one; but I need not tell you&#xD;
that. You see yourself it had been shattered, and&#xD;
had not an interest to bind it again together. I could&#xD;
not settle down to quiet charities, to little patriotic&#xD;
sacrifices; I could not busy myself reading or study-&#xD;
ing, for.to what end should I study? My life had, in-&#xD;
deed, been "broken at the fountain," broken when it&#xD;
was so young, so hopeful, it seemed to itself hardly to&#xD;
have sprung into being.&#xD;
Kate, on the contrary, was full of animation; she&#xD;
was president of half a dozen benevolent institutions,&#xD;
and yet had always time to spare 'for amusement.&#xD;
Captain Lewis was now resting under the shadow of&#xD;
her wings; and his 'very evident fear of her struck&#xD;
me very comically. It made one little change in my.&#xD;
sad life, watching the progress of this little comedy,&#xD;
pretty sure to end, as comedies should, in speedy mar-&#xD;
riage.         4&#xD;
"Do you know that Captain Lewis, the odious&#xD;
man, is positively going off to-morrow?" Kate said to&#xD;

me the evening after, Gilbert's visit. "It is just too&#xD;
aggravating for any thing in this world, just as we&#xD;
were getting on so nicely! I am going to Mrs. Wil-&#xD;
cox's tonight, a sort of God-speed party to ~he officers&#xD;

been holding me, after the ix~anner of the Ancient&#xD;
Mariner, until my patience is quite exhausted. Will&#xD;
you help me ?~.~~do dress my hair for me; I look like a&#xD;
been th&#xD;
ditYerent person. after I have rough your hands.&#xD;
Will you ?---that is- a darling. Here!', She threw me&#xD;
a wrapper. "Hurry now, and ~do me up pretty."&#xD;
"Captain Lewis is not half good enough for you,"&#xD;
I said, taking down her hair.&#xD;
- "1~ don't suppose he is," she answered; "we are&#xD;
not expected to marry men half good enough for us.&#xD;
I expect to marry because I don't want to be an old&#xD;
maid, and because I want a home of my. own. I shall&#xD;
be quite contented if my~ husband hasn't any very&#xD;
serious faults, and for the rest I mean to educate him&#xD;
up t~ me."&#xD;
"But you know, Kate, this home is as* much yours&#xD;
as: mine; more* yours, for my lamp of life has gone&#xD;
&amp;amp;ut, and I want only a dark corner; the rest is all&#xD;
yours.&#xD;
"Oh! I know you and Uniile Vane, are kindness it-&#xD;
self, but no wom~n likes to sit at the side of any man's&#xD;
table. How. natural, you look in that cashmere. I&#xD;
never saw any woman but you who looked well ~in&#xD;

I am just as Loud of good times as I was ten years&#xD;

the rest? Do you remember the summer they were&#xD;
here, just before Mr. Aberl;hnay went away? I think&#xD;
that was about the most delightful summer we ever&#xD;
had. I did like Mr. Aberthnay so much ~ I had a&#xD;
splendid talk with him once. Shall I tell you about&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Yes, do."&#xD;
"It was just before he went away. Florence~ you&#xD;
know, was just wild about him, and, it seems, she told&#xD;
him you had told her you were engaged to Mr. Stuart&#xD;
Gilbert, you know,-or what amounted to the same&#xD;
thing. He let it out to me, or, at least, I drew it out&#xD;
of h~,for I knew he was loving you beyond all&#xD;
bounds. I did think then that you liked' him, and I&#xD;
was, myself; half in love with Gilbert Stuart,-just a&#xD;
girl's fancy, you know; and so I up and down denied&#xD;
it, and just 19t him see what Florence was up to; then&#xD;
we talked about you. He said he knew you were not&#xD;
happy, and he asked me to be especially. kind to you;&#xD;
and if any thing happened to you, to write and let him&#xD;
know, without your knowledge; he did care so much&#xD;
for you!"&#xD;
"Did you ever write him ?"&#xD;

"Sure enough, what need?"&#xD;
"I think I was never so happy in my life when. I&#xD;
heard you were engaged to him. I dou't think any&#xD;
man ever loved a woman as much as he did you, even&#xD;
then. Do you know, he actually made me promise not&#xD;
to tell you; he' was sure you did not care for him, and&#xD;
said it would only be additional pain to you to know&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
"Poor Carl !"&#xD;
"There was never a man like him. No one can&#xD;
wonder, Georgie, that your life seems broken. But do&#xD;
not let us talk about it., I like to look up in the glass&#xD;
and see you look like old times; and now that your&#xD;

me, 'Wasn't it a surprise, Kate ?-just as if she hadn't&#xD;

"Uncle ought to be home sQon." He was in New&#xD;
York. "We two women are not much of a house.&#xD;

"Not much. Do you know alout David?"&#xD;
"No;' what?"&#xD;
"lie, is going down to the army as officer's ser-&#xD;

"Ar'n't you ~&#xD;
"I will go down and see what I can find inthe&#xD;

I pushed my hair out of the way, and the old habit&#xD;
sent it back from my face as lused to wear it. It startled&#xD;
me to see it rippling so naturally into its old folds, and&#xD;
sparkling all over with smiles at its release. I wound&#xD;
it in a hasty coil, and hurried down stair~ to get the&#xD;
Lowers in the little conservatory beyond the parlor.&#xD;
Something,-the change of dress, perhaps, or the back-&#xD;

for surely he is here."&#xD;
I held out my hands; I hardly know if in welcome&#xD;
or to 'push away~ that figure. They 'were closely&#xD;
grasped, and a voice cried, "Georgie! ~eorgie! "-&#xD;
that voice that could 'inspire or terrify whole regi-&#xD;
ments, and would melt the hardest heart.&#xD;
"Georgie! Georgie!"&#xD;
"Is this real?" I asked, like one in a maze; "is to~&#xD;
night that other night when I met you here?"&#xD;
"It is not that other night," he answered; "that&#xD;
was a night that I have expiated by long, long years&#xD;
of bitter pain. I fell once from my strength, and&#xD;
faith; and honor."&#xD;
"Yes, I' know," I said, drawing back a little; "she&#xD;
told. me."&#xD;
"She told you, too, that I was free?"&#xD;
"She told me."&#xD;
"Oh! if she could have told you how I fought&#xD;
against her influence,~how bitterly I have repented&#xD;
the folly that bound me to her, and put that gulf be.&#xD;
tween us, between you~ and me, Georgie. I cannot&#xD;
tell you that I love ~rou; I have told' her that; and&#xD;
words that any other woman has heard, are not words&#xD;
to say to you. You know what I would say to you;&#xD;
what burned on my lips la~st night, but which your&#xD;
constrained, manner and son~bre dress forbade me' to&#xD;
say. Georgie, give me the words I lack; tell me in'&#xD;
&#xD;
what manner I may speak to you of the love that has&#xD;
been m3r 'life, my joy, and my agony for years, and&#xD;
years, and years."&#xD;
"Yes, I know," I said.&#xD;
"You know; it is only a heart like yours that can&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Let me think," I said.&#xD;
"~To, no, donut think; I have waited for this day,&#xD;
-waited when there was no hope that it gould ever&#xD;

to forgive me,-to wait, to let me explain; to give me&#xD;
a word that would make me strong enough to burst&#xD;
my bonds, were they ten times as binding. I have&#xD;
waited; I can wait no longer; you risked your life for&#xD;
me in Charleston; you risked still more for me in&#xD;
Richmond. Yes, I know; Kate told me where you&#xD;

longed for him 1-but for one hour that I could find&#xD;
expressIon for that self~reproach; greater than any&#xD;
rage, which has had triple revenge on me for my sin!&#xD;
Georgie, speak one word to me, and I shall forget all&#xD;
my past misery."&#xD;
"I do not know what I ought to say."&#xD;
"Do not mar this blessed day with doubts ~nd&#xD;
fears. You have had your sorrows,--mine no words&#xD;
can tell. Let us join hands to-night, and sorrow will&#xD;
be forgotten forevermore. I dare not say what I will&#xD;
strive to be to you. I fear not to promise any thing,&#xD;
for whatever you would wish me to bei~hat your wish&#xD;
will make me. If you will but say the word, Georgie,&#xD;
you stretch before my feet a life of joy, and good,&#xD;
and glory; there is no path I could not tread if that&#xD;
path led to you. There is nothing I might not be, if&#xD;
you willed me so to be. Will you throw away my&#xD;
life? Will you throw away my future, and trample&#xD;
upon my past.? I hold all that I am, or hope to be, or&#xD;
aspire to do, in my hand; one word decides it."&#xD;
"I implore you, spare me."&#xD;
"I will not spare you. This thing shall be. Is&#xD;
my life nothing ?-is my soul nothing, my will not to&#xD;
be counted? I will never let y~bu rest. I will follow&#xD;
you night and day. I will love you till love becomes&#xD;
madness; and while there is breath within me I will&#xD;
breathe for you, and raise my voice in suplieations.&#xD;
You are drawing farther away? I frighten you?&#xD;
&#xD;
Darling, darling Georgie, whom I love with such love&#xD;
as man never gave before, speak to me as I would&#xD;
have you speak, and you shall never again hear my&#xD;
voice but in tenderest tones,-never hear a word from&#xD;
me but of unalterable devotion; but, Georgie, you&#xD;
must speak that word. What would you say if I&#xD;
gave way at the first fire of the enemy? Shall I give&#xD;
up now, when I fight for more than life, or land, or&#xD;
government ?-when I fight for heaven here and&#xD;
heaven hereafter. Wilt you speak, Georgie?"&#xD;
"I loved you once, I know, with a love strong as&#xD;
your own. You threw aside that love."&#xD;
"I did, I did; for one hour I was another man. I&#xD;
threw away a pearl beyond price; but myself again,&#xD;
I #11 have back that pearl. I will seek it early and&#xD;
late; nor will I rest until it is mine. lNo, Georgie, I&#xD;
will yield,-I will go out into pain and utter deso-&#xD;
lation, if you say so. I have pained you enough.&#xD;
If I can control myself I will plead no longer; just as&#xD;
we stand fronting the battle-line, waiting victory or&#xD;
death, I will try to stand."&#xD;
He folded h{s arms and stood still; he was pale as&#xD;
death itself and it seemed as if every nerve was&#xD;
strained to preserve the silence and outward calm he&#xD;
had promised. At my feet lay the love I had worn&#xD;
out half my soul lQnging for; yet, now that it was&#xD;

"iIi'inal or not matters little to me," I answered.&#xD;
"But this does matter, that you should know that I do&#xD;
not love you. It is true that the belief that I loved&#xD;
you grew with my growth, and became almost a part&#xD;
of me. The force of habit is great with all; it was like&#xD;
iron chains on me; when I met you at intervals, you&#xD;
pieced and strengthened the links that were wearing&#xD;
away. That I thought I loved you was a burden upon&#xD;
me under which another, a better and higher love, I&#xD;
can see now, was living and struggling to the light.&#xD;

in her hand. I don't know that Gilbert was struck&#xD;
&#xD;
with her beauty, but I think he noticed the amplitude&#xD;
of her skirts that effectually cut off his retreat, as she&#xD;
stood there with Captain Lewis, not over-pleased at&#xD;
the detention.&#xD;
"I give ~ou ten minutes to dress," Uncle Tom said&#xD;
to me. "Don't change that dress."&#xD;
I left the parlor by a door that led into our sitting-&#xD;
room. Some one spoke; there was a figure there; CarPs,&#xD;
or his spirit.&#xD;
"I do not think," I said, as soon as I could coin-&#xD;
mand my voice, "that any evil thing would be per~&#xD;
emitted to take your form, my husband. It seems a fit&#xD;
ending to the tumult of to-night that your spirit should&#xD;
come, not to reproach me, surely, but to let me say&#xD;
that, at last, I am yours,-all, all yours,-and that I&#xD;
live to meet you in heaven."&#xD;
"Do knot be afraid, Georgie," the figure said, ap-&#xD;
proaching me. "I am not a spirit; I am your real,&#xD;
living husband, if you will own me. These are no&#xD;
spirit arms that hold you, darling."&#xD;
"My Carl! I am surely dreaming, or my senses&#xD;
have given way; but it is a delirium so sweet Iwould&#xD;
never be sane again! Yes, darling Carl, hold me&#xD;

fears to trust its voice, not an hour ago, almost fright-&#xD;
ened me, and I trembled lest at the very moment I&#xD;

just so, and was inxorable. I cannot tell yow how I&#xD;

&#xD;
as much as the rustic's unrestrained laughter at old&#xD;
stage-jokes.~ I am still on. the invalid corps, so excuse&#xD;
my story, Georgie, if it lacks hair-breadth escapes and&#xD;
thrilling scenes. I cannot go through the story of the&#xD;
past six months, although in the simplest words and&#xD;
merely in outline, without feeling intensely the old&#xD;
struggles. I am not much at telling stories."&#xD;
"People generally' make the preface after the tale&#xD;
is told," I suggested.&#xD;
." You must know then," Carl continued, "that I&#xD;
went into the secession movement with the best inten~&#xD;
tions in the world,~ and with a romantic idea of liberty,&#xD;
tyrants, and 'down with the fierce oppressor.' As the&#xD;
movement grew more serious, and nien discussed not&#xD;
only its expediency but its right, I found myself&#xD;
* several times knocked in the head by arguments that&#xD;
left their mark. I was, however, heart 'and soul in the&#xD;
cause; with all my heart and soul believed it right,&#xD;
or, perhaps, as we are all human, I should not have so.&#xD;
* readily promised Georgie, who, you, know, Mr. Vane,&#xD;
was stout for the Union, that if I ever doubted the&#xD;
right of the Southern' cause that 'I would give it&#xD;
up. I am not going to tell you of my battles and&#xD;
heroic achievements at present; I was asked how&#xD;
I came here, and it is of~ inward struggles I have&#xD;
now to speak. 'I went~ off. to~ the war, strong, and&#xD;
unshaken; .1 shut my eyes, as every' soldier should,&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7997-00000150"/>&#xD;
no bad leadership however much it may injure can&#xD;
ever make less right. But as I was thrown among&#xD;
our officers and soldiers, I was forced to see, and to&#xD;
see with disgust, to how many low and base motives&#xD;
appeals were made, and how few, how very few were&#xD;
moved by sterling principle. But there were other&#xD;
men, earnest like myseW men whose souls had panted&#xD;
for action through many idle years, and we helped&#xD;
each other's doubting faith. I do not believe because&#xD;
others scorned to own to any lack of faith that they did&#xD;
not also doubt. After awhile it became my place to be&#xD;
much among the prisoners,-prisoners of both sides.&#xD;
I met among the Union prisoners, officers and privates,&#xD;
men of intelligence, culture, understanding, and of&#xD;
thorough worth; men who fully and clearly saw and&#xD;
knew'for what they were lighting. They spoke of us&#xD;
with decision in regard to our political sins,-they&#xD;
never minced matters about these,-but I scarcely&#xD;
ever heard one betray any vindictiveness, bitterness,&#xD;
Or any personal animosity. Considering they fought&#xD;
well, believed in the war, and intended to carry it&#xD;
through, and were influenced in their opinions by no&#xD;
desire for our good will, nor fear of us, I liked their&#xD;
mildness. One officer, I remember, one day said to&#xD;
me: 'I ~have been over many battle-fields, and have&#xD;
everywhere been struck by the truly noble physique&#xD;
of' your dead; it is hard such' fine fellows must go&#xD;
down like so much grass, but the cause 6f the' natin&#xD;

demands it, and you know we light you just as hard&#xD;
as though .we had not a thousand times rather wel-&#xD;
come you to our tables in thorough good fellowship.&#xD;
Are you brothers or barbarians we must light you&#xD;
just the same, so long as you rebel against our govern-&#xD;
ment and yours. But we fight ourselves, almost, in&#xD;
fighting you; we have an older' brother sort of feeling&#xD;
toward you; we can't judge you quite a's severely as&#xD;
if you were not a wayward younger brother. You&#xD;
will never believe how much of affection there is in&#xD;
our feelings toward you. Men like you, Major, can&#xD;
understand it, others may call it cowardice, servility,&#xD;
or some other unworthy name; the fact remains un-&#xD;
altered.' Our own soldiers always -came back from&#xD;
the North subdued by their visits to the strongholds&#xD;
of the nation; no sneers, no contemptuous remarks, no&#xD;
insulting names for them as they went sullen and&#xD;
sulky to their prisons. I have known of very many&#xD;
acts of reali kindness aiid consideration from the Union&#xD;
guards to their prisoners; sometimes when these lat~&#xD;
t~r have been tired, worn, sick or wounded, perhaps,&#xD;
the others have dismounted from their horses and let&#xD;
their prisoners take their place, they trudging' by on&#xD;
foot. But mark this-their food, their horses, their&#xD;
blankets, they might share, or give, but never liberty,'&#xD;
or an~ acknowledgment that they were not ~ rebeLs'&#xD;

her reasons for her faith with a will, and with never a&#xD;

After a time I left the hospital and tossed about in&#xD;
various ways, and worked hard to keep thoughts out&#xD;
of my head, and to show myself really a soldier. I&#xD;
kept from thinking moderately well until I was again&#xD;
wounded in the summer. I did hope I might die then,&#xD;
and be spared the pain of decision, .which is the pain&#xD;
always; to act is nothing. I found. it hard to decide;&#xD;
I could not fight 'against my convictions, and my&#xD;
promise to Georgie, and it was hard to desert 'the&#xD;
cause I had been one of the first to embrace. But 'my&#xD;
convictions and my health would not give way, but&#xD;
struggled on to strength. I could not die; I was~&#xD;
forced to decide. I could not stay longer in the house&#xD;
of the kind Southern people, who, proud to have a*&#xD;
Southern officer in the house with them, exerted them.'&#xD;
selves' to the utmost to take care of me, and were,&#xD;
indeed, mothers and sisters to me; and I got away&#xD;
from them as soon as I could, resolved if I had to~ live&#xD;
to make my way to headquarters, resign, and then who&#xD;
could tell what? I had hardly clearly made. up my&#xD;
mind in this respect, than I was taken prisoner~ You&#xD;
can imagine my rage and chagrin. To declare myself&#xD;
an unbeliever in secession, to give up. my. commission&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7997-00000152"/>&#xD;
suggestions against my honor for me to think of it.&#xD;
In this painful state of mind I was taken into the&#xD;
4Ynion lines, and into the hands of some officers who&#xD;
treated me with every attention, care,. and kindness.&#xD;
I was very much exhausted, so much so that they&#xD;
soon expressed their fears that I was past recovery. -I&#xD;
did nothing to undeceive them. ,They forced me to&#xD;
take a little wine. Every thing seemed in confusion,&#xD;
but I lay quietly and without motion, while orderlies&#xD;
came "and went, or gathered around the tent door. I&#xD;
gathered scraps of their conversation; fortunately it&#xD;
was a kind that did me good. .The tents were near&#xD;
together, and as. the evening, grew quieter I could&#xD;
hear, was foi-ced to. hear the conversation in the next&#xD;
tent-to the one to which I had been taken. I 'wish I&#xD;
could repeat to you kind words, high-toned sentiments,&#xD;
brave energetic thoughts which were thrown in my&#xD;
way that night.&#xD;
"For some reason I was carried farther on, or in a&#xD;
different direction, and, I think, they broke up camp,&#xD;
or' there was dangerdof an attack, for two men were&#xD;
left in charge of me, and there was complete silence&#xD;
around me. A thunder-storm came up, a violent one,&#xD;
and at every burst of thunder my-guard started, and&#xD;
muttered something meant, perhaps, for a prayer.&#xD;
They did their duty by occasionally pouring down my&#xD;
throat a few drops of some liquor which had been left&#xD;

of the same, until, as will sometimes happen, the bottle&#xD;
showed itself to be empty. One of the men expressed&#xD;
his convictions that he could find more if he looked in&#xD;
the right place, and with his bottle under his overcoat&#xD;
started on the quest, leaving his companion alone&#xD;
with me. This man, evidently, did not relish a lonely&#xD;
watch, a dark night, a thunder-storm, a dying rebel,&#xD;
and no whiskey, and soon moved after his partner.&#xD;

The' rascal left his overcoat, into which I put myself,&#xD;
and, forcing my strength back, I got out of the tent.&#xD;
I found myself unable to go far, but found a hiding-&#xD;
place so near at hand that, to speak after the manner&#xD;
of the Hibernians, it was beyond suspicion. The men&#xD;
after awhile returned, very angry, very tipsy, and very&#xD;
much scared. 'I knew the divil would have the -&#xD;

'But what would the divil want* of me overcoat.?'&#xD;
asked the other. 'Maybe the ould gintleman don't&#xD;

testimony, j[ suppose, of my death. I am soi~ry to&#xD;
have such things to record of TJnion patriots; hut hu-&#xD;
i~ian nature is' human nature, you know.&#xD;
"I got to a small hut in the wood, was taken in,&#xD;
gave the owners some money, laid down on the floor,&#xD;
and had a raging fever. They took such care as they&#xD;
could of me, and as I was not destined to die, I lived.&#xD;
When I was able to stir I got back to the South. No&#xD;
one wondered that I resigned, for I was completely&#xD;
smashed up. I worked along slowly, very slowly in-&#xD;
deed. You were gone to the North I supposed. I&#xD;
m~ade no inquiries lest I should interfere with your&#xD;
plans. I made arrangements to follow you; slow ar-&#xD;
rangements, for I was laid up every few days. I got&#xD;
through the lines of both armies; it would be impru-&#xD;
dent, as the i~ewspapers say, to give the details.&#xD;
"Resting at New York I was reoogiiized in my&#xD;
olckni capacity as a Southern officer, a muss was made,&#xD;
and I was arrested. No one would listen to me; time&#xD;
and my money were wearing away; but believing&#xD;
every day must be the last, I forbore any steps for my&#xD;
release or assistance. However, I couldn't expect any&#xD;
thing better, and tried to wait, with resignation.&#xD;
Geo;rgie knows ,why I did not send word to her, and&#xD;
was even half doubtful, sometimes, of how she would&#xD;
receive me. In Tdu~ time I was released, without any&#xD;
questions on either side, and th*en was I mad! If I&#xD;
were not a spy they had no right to arrest me; if I&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
were a spy they had no right to free me; and they&#xD;
knew no more of me on the day they opened my&#xD;
prison doors thaxi on the day they first closed them&#xD;
between me and liberty. I went to Washington; I&#xD;
lost time, strength, money, and temper, but gained&#xD;
no satisfaction nor notice, except that a scamp of an&#xD;
editor got hold of my name, and made a paragraph&#xD;
about me. Said paragraph came to the notice of&#xD;
somebody who knew Mr. Vane; who, meeting Mr.&#xD;
Vane one day, questioned him of me. Exclamations&#xD;
and explanations 'followed. Mr. Vane took his cane&#xD;
and started after me. He came in good time; he&#xD;
owed you a surprise, he said. I make no attempt to&#xD;
tell you all he did for me; but we journeyed together,&#xD;
and here I am. These are but the hurried outlines of&#xD;
my history; if I live I shall give yon incidents enough&#xD;
to fill them up to a three-volumed novel. But this&#xD;
must do for to-night. You know, Goergie, I have a&#xD;
story to hear."&#xD;
"Yes, Carl, and you shall hear it, although I have&#xD;
told you nearly all. I told 'you before that I visited&#xD;
a grave supposed to be yours. Oh, what a night it&#xD;
was! You must have that name changed."&#xD;
"No, I mean to leave it. They carried it rather&#xD;
far, but it is true in one sense. Blank A1~ert1~nay,&#xD;
C. S. A., i8 dead and buried. There is poetic and.&#xD;
proper justice in that inscription. A leader, as he was&#xD;

this terrible ball of battle rolling, he owed his grave&#xD;
to his enemies; and of him remains only a mutilated&#xD;
name, and three letters that tell the history of his life&#xD;
and his death, hi~ sin and his shame. How like the&#xD;
prophetic wish of your favorite poet:&#xD;

"And now," said my Uncle Tom, "what is to be&#xD;
the next move?"&#xD;
"As soon as I am strong enough I am going into&#xD;
your army, and repair as well as I can some of the&#xD;
injury I have done the country."&#xD;
"And it shall be my part," added my uncle, "to&#xD;
get your commission. Don't give yourself a moment's&#xD;
thought on the subject. I will attend to it."&#xD;
"Commission me no commissions," Carl said; "I&#xD;
have always had great regard for the good son who&#xD;
stayed quietly at home, and for whom the fatted calf&#xD;
was never killed. I hav.e no right to any of the honors&#xD;
of the land, and1 yet it is an honor to wear the uniform&#xD;
of theUnited States in any capacity. I shall be grated&#xD;
ful if I can be allowed to wear it in its humblest man&#xD;
&#xD;
ner, and shall be glad if I am permitted to take my&#xD;
chances at the eleventh hour with those who have&#xD;
borne the heat and burden of the day. Don't cry,&#xD;
Georgie; I haven't gone yet."&#xD;
"Half my tears are tears of pride. Xo king ever&#xD;
laid down his crown, and took up the cowl of a monk&#xD;
with purer charity, and higher courage than you have&#xD;
changed the livery of secession for that of govern-&#xD;
ment. I am proud of you, dear Carl, for I know,&#xD;
* darling, what it has cost you to do it. God knows,&#xD;
too."&#xD;
"It costs much, and yet less than you think. It is&#xD;
the only thing that I could do. It is not a matter&#xD;
that admits of question or doubt; it is, indeed, a&#xD;
* luxury to do a work that is so clearly chalked out. I&#xD;
think the pains of doubt and indecision are very nearly&#xD;
the severest pains, and the most difficult to bear of any&#xD;
in this world."&#xD;
"I think so too, Carl," I said, "and I think as&#xD;
well it is a luxury to do a work that is so clearly&#xD;
marked out as mine."&#xD;
"Yours!" echoed Uncle Tom, "a woman's work!&#xD;
What might be the labor of your life?"&#xD;
"Woman's work has generally no name, but it is&#xD;
none the less a work, even though it is nameless, or&#xD;
well loved." -&#xD;
"I never knew her to do any thing in her life"&#xD;
my Uncle Tom said to Carl; "she isn't eveu president&#xD;
of a single benevolent association."&#xD;

WHAT more can I tell you, ye patient friends,&#xD;

&#xD;
One day I read my husband's name in the paper, a&#xD;
few more and I was with him.&#xD;
"My fighting days are over, "he said, mournfully,&#xD;
"I shall never be fit for service again. It is too soon; I&#xD;
did hope you would have had a soldier's sword to&#xD;
show to our children, but a sergeant's uniform and' a&#xD;
musket are all there is to cover the stain of rebellion."&#xD;
"It is all wiped out," I said; "there is no stain left.&#xD;
And now I have back your honor, and I have you, my&#xD;
darling, never to lose you again, to be hands for you&#xD;
evermore, my darling Carl. Hush! not a word, I am&#xD;
your 4yrant henceforth, and oh! what a tyrant I&#xD;
shall be!~~&#xD;
A few 'days ago he called me to him. "In your&#xD;
duty to the country, do not forget your duty to&#xD;
society, Georgie pet. Read this," he said.&#xD;
And I read, under the head of" Marriages," in the&#xD;
'Ikrald:&#xD;
"Sti~art- l7xne.-On Thursday, at 'the residence&#xD;
of L. ~'C. Carter, Esq., Gilbert Stuart, Captain&#xD;
Mass. Vols., to Miss Gertrude Vane, eldest daughter&#xD;
of G. W. Vane, Brig.-Gen. C. S. A. Richmond papers&#xD;
please copy."&#xD;
"It's Stuart and J7~ne, notwithstanding," my hus-&#xD;
band said.'&#xD;
"Yes," I answered, "but he has taken a different&#xD;
manner tf vanity."&#xD;
"Well," added my husband, "I am glad ~friend&#xD;
&#xD;
{&#xD;
&#xD;
Stuart is At Anchor at last. There is anchorage for&#xD;
all of us if we are only patient and faithfully follow&#xD;
the light that is within us. Which sentiment, by the&#xD;
way, being very true, suggestive, and exceedingly&#xD;
well expressed, will do for the moral of your book."&#xD;
"I wouldn't end up with a mdral," I replied, "for&#xD;
any thing in this world. If you and I haven't lived&#xD;
long enough to prove a warning or an assistance we&#xD;
had better give up."&#xD;
"I haven't an idea of such a thing as giving up,"&#xD;
said Carl, "we are only just beginning to live. I feel&#xD;
that you and I have not battled so long for nothing,&#xD;
l5ut that through all 'i~e have been preserved and&#xD;
strengthened for some thoroughly good work even' in&#xD;
this world. There is nothing we cannot do if we work&#xD;
together. I have seen, at the seashore, boats rocking&#xD;
idly on the waves, day after day, when suddenly I&#xD;
would see them, sails spread, Ilags flying, and all&#xD;
hands busy, dashing bravely off to sea. Perhaps they&#xD;
had been hauled up for repairs, as we are; at any&#xD;
rate, they sailed none the less swiftly, and were none&#xD;
the less strong and secure for having lain At Anchor,&#xD;
at the Master's wilL There's a moral in spite of you,&#xD;
Georgie."&#xD;
