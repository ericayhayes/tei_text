                  really good grammar, and fewer still punctuate decently, that a book that informs
                  them how to do so—and not only that indicates their faults, but shows them how
                  they are to be corrected—cannot fail to be popular; <emph>there is not a person,

                  inexperienced, from the pen of one of the ablest of needle-women of the present
                  age.</item>
               <item>ANECDOTES OF LOVE. Being a true account of the most remarkable events connected
                  with the History of Love in all Ages and among all Nations. By LOLA MONTEZ,
                  Countess of Landsfeldt. Large 12mo, cloth, price <unclear>1 00</unclear>. These
                  romantic and surprising anecdotes really contain all of the most tragic and comic
                  events connected with the history of the tender passion among all nations and in
                  all ages of the world. It is precisely the kind of book which a man will find it
                  impossible to relinquish until he has read it through from the first to the last
                  chapter. And besides the exciting love histories embraced in this volume, it
                  really contains a great deal of valuable historic lore, which is not to be found
                  except by reading through interminable volumes.</item>
               <item>ARTS OF BEAUTY; or, <hi rend="i"/>Secrets of a Lady's Toilet. With Hints to
                  Gentlemen on the Art of Fascinating. By Madame LOLA MONTEZ, Countess of
                  Landsfeldt. Cloth, gilt side, price 50. This book contains an account, in detail,
                  of all the arts employed by the fashionable ladies of all the chief cities of
                  Europe, for the purpose of developing and preserving their charms. Independent of
                  its rare and really useful matter, the book is a curiosity as a piece of art,
                  itself, for the most delicate subjects are handled with a skill, and an
                  unexceptional propriety of language, which is really surprising. This work is also
                  full of the curious and useful recipes, used by the beauties of Europe, and will
                  enable our ladies to supply their toilets, at a trifling cost, with what cannot be
                  purchased at the perfumer's at any cost.</item>

                  work is a complete adaptation to American peculiarities of every species of useful
                  information upon Marine and Fresh Water Aquariums, to be met with in the elaborate
                  volumes of European authority; together with a careful concentration of all the
                  practical results of the author's great experience in the structure and management
                  of Aquaria.</item>

            <p>THE author dedicates this work to all <emph>Americans</emph> who love their country;
               to all <emph>men</emph>, who loving justice and scorning oppression and wrong,
                  <emph>despise</emph> the oppressor. He sends it forth for the PEOPLE's perusal,
               well aware of its imperfections, but hoping that though in itself it may fail to work
               the great good which he desires, it may arouse the <emph>People</emph> to
                  <emph>thought</emph>, and induce ultimate <emph>action</emph> upon matters which
               deeply concern the welfare of the Nation. It is not written to make money, for he
               values money as little as he does the smile of an aristocrat; it is not written to
               gain for its author <emph>literary fame</emph>, else would he have chosen a more
               congenial subject—have launched his bark upon his old <emph>home</emph>, the ocean,
               and wandered away among the lovely maidens, and luscious fruits, and beautiful
               flowers of the Southern Isles; or, mounting his blooded steed, as of yore, have
               dashed out upon the lake-like prairie, through the grand forests, or over the wild
               hills of the glowing West. It is written to stir up a hornet's nest—it is written to
               show <emph>Americans</emph> that they are nursing <emph>serpents</emph> in their
               bosoms; it is written to illustrate the destiny of those who, forgetting themselves
               in their sympathy for the wrongs of the human family, dare to come out and battle
               against vice and error, for the RIGHT. To the MEN and WOMEN of America I offer it; I
               ask its perusal at their hands, for there are <emph>truths</emph> in it which
                  <emph>must</emph> be heard.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>IN a small attic chamber, of a house in an obscure street of New York, a young man
                  was seated, whose position and expression of countenance indicated a thoughtful
                  anxiety—a mind not altogether at rest. The furniture of the room was very simple.
                  It consisted of a small cot bed, a couple of chairs, a pine table, upon which lay
                  a few sheets of paper, pen and ink, a newspaper or two, and three or four monthly
                  magazines and reviews. In one corner, a tin basin and a water pitcher, <hi
                     rend="i"/>minus the handle, answered for <hi rend="i"/>ablutory apparatus. A
                  few engravings of various kinds were wafered against the walls, without frames.
                  This constituted all the furniture of the apartment. The room was very small—where
                  the roof slanted off, one could not stand upright, but by the window, and back
                  near the door it was higher.</p>
               <p>There was nothing very remarkable in the appearance of the sole occupant of this
                  room. He looked pale and thin, and there was an expression of care and inward
                  suffering, which might excite the sympathy of a close observer. His age appeared
                  to be twenty-five years, or thereabouts; his forehead was rather high and square,
                  lips thin and expressive of firmness, eyes of blue, and features indicating an<pb
                     n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6961-00000005"/> Anglo-Norman <unclear>descent</unclear> as
                  did also the thick masses of slightly curling light brown hair, which descended
                  low upon his very white neck. He was of medium height, full chested but slender in
                  the waist, with small hands and feet. His dress, without being actually shabby,
                  denoted poverty. It had been fashioned in its day, even as were fig leaves in "the
                  good old days of Adam and Eve," and it was "cut to fit," but now it was
                  threadbare, and in places had been darned with stitches of a variable character,
                  long and short ones, evidently put in by an unskilful hand. From this the reader
                  will correctly infer that the young gentleman was enduring single wretchedness,
                  and had not yet had the presumption to attempt to starve any man's daughter.</p>
               <p>It was about seven o'clock in the morning. The bed wherein he had passed the night
                  had not yet been made up, but having made a proper use of soap, water and the tow
                  towel hung on a nail over the wash-stand, the young man had seated himself and
                  seemed pondering on some absorbing object, for from time to time, he mutteringly
                  repeated this word: "Strange, <emph>strange</emph>, STRANGE."</p>
               <p>The loud ring of a breakfast bell, below stairs, did not seem to disturb his
                  meditations, but a few minutes afterwards a light tap at his door caused him to
                  start to his feet, and as he did so, in a low voice he bade the visitor enter.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and a very pretty little girl, of fourteen or fifteen years of
                  age, (judging from her looks,) entered, saying at the same time:</p>
               <p>"Breakfast is ready, Mr. Cramer—after you go down I'll make up your bed and sweep
                  your room!"</p>
               <p>It was very impolite in him, but the young man made no immediate reply to the fair
                  girl, but with his arms folded on his breast, stood and gazed intently at her. He
                  might be excused for this, though, for she was <emph>very</emph> handsome. Her
                  apparel indicated that she was not yet considered "a young lady," for she wore a
                  short dress, and from beneath, the lace-bottomed, coquettish pantalet, peeped out
                  a beautiful little foot, bound in a slipper of black morocco. Her low-necked dress
                  revealed shoulders and neck of snowy whiteness, plump and graceful—short sleeves
                  permitted her arms to appear in view; arms so plump, so round, so tapering into
                  the delicate wrist and ending in lovely hands, that any man of taste who had his
                  choice of the manner of dying, would like to be hugged to death by them. Her hair
                  was very dark, and hung in wavy ringlets down over her lovely neck and shoulders,
                  rendering loveliness lovelier by the contrast of color. Her features, though not
                  classically regular, were very pleasing; her countenance was expressive, gay and
                  smiling. She looked as if sad thoughts never had yet entered her young heart—as if
                  no storm had vet clouded the May-flowers of her existence. Her complexion was
                  rich, and glowing with the ruddy hue of health; her eyes, oh, <emph>such</emph>
                  eyes! The very soul and life of her beauty was in her eyes, fringed as they were
                  by black, glossy lashes, which, when her glance was cast down, lay like delicate
                  pencilings below the eye-lid. In color, they were jetty-black, and as softly,
                  liquidly bright as the eye of a pet gazelle. Such a beauty was LIZZIE LAUREL.</p>
               <p>What wonder, then, that Ernest Cramer looked at her for full a minute after she
                  entered the room, without speaking, and that she, blushing a very little beneath
                  his earnest gaze, repeated her first remark.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Lizzie—thank you!" he replied. "I feel no appetite this morning. I
                  think I shall not go down to breakfast!"</p>
               <p>"Why, my goodness, Mr. Cramer! You don't eat as much as my pet kitten. I declare
                  you must be in love!"</p>
               <p>"No, Lizzie, for <emph>me</emph> there is <emph>no</emph> love, and but little joy
                  on earth. I have but a sad fate, my sweet friend!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't say so, sir! You don't know everything, though you do write for the
                  papers and make poetry!"</p>
               <p>"That is true, Lizzie," replied the young man gravely, "and as you sometimes stop
                  laughing and singing, to <emph>think</emph>, I am about to ask your advice."</p>
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> advice? Ah, I see you've got tired of sewing on your buttons—mean
                  to get married, and want to know who to have. Now don't have an old maid,
                  because—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, you little tease. I'm not so desperately situated as to<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000006"/> be forced into thoughts of matrimony; I've had a
                  dream, a very <emph>strange</emph> dream!".</p>
               <p>"Oh, pshaw! There's no romance in dreams," cried the young beauty, pettishly, "go
                  to grandma if you want a dream interpreted."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish an interpretation, Lizzie. I wish your advice as to which of two
                  courses to take, for, in this dream, two roads through life were laid open before
                  me, and I was directed to make a choice of one or the other!"</p>
               <p>"Then I'll advise you to take the one which you'll not have to travel alone on! I
                  don't believe in going on a long journey all alone!"</p>
               <p>"But <emph>hear</emph> my dream before you advise me, Lizzie!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Poet, I will, if you won't be too long, for if you are, the breakfast
                  will get all cold, and—and maybe mother will think you've been courting me, and
                  you <emph>know</emph> that <emph>that</emph> isn't so."</p>
               <p>The coquettish girl, both in tone and look, rather <emph>hinted</emph> that she
                  would not have been displeased if it had been so; but Ernest did not appear to
                  understand or care for the hint, but proceeded to relate his</p>
               <p>DREAM.</p>
               <p>"I thought," he said, "that I stood upon a hill-side, admiring a lovely landscape
                  which lay spread out like a picture before me. Close at the bottom of the hill was
                  a small lake fringed with long-leaved willows, upon which the broad green leaves
                  and white blossoms of the water-lily floated. From this a small stream made
                  outlet, running off in a silvery thread along a valley, through meadows and
                  fields, here passing close before a cottage door, and kissing the bare feet of
                  white-headed children which waded through its bright waters; there dashing in foam
                  over a rocky ledge, and eddying away into deeper and more sluggish channels
                  below."</p>
               <p>"I'll sit down sir, if you please!" cried Lizzie, taking a chair. "I see you are
                  going to tell a long story. Now go on, sir; you left off in the stream!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, never mind the landscape; I'll not bore you with a description of
                  that, but be as brief as possible. I was standing alone, as I thought, upon this
                  hill-side, when a voice close by my side, so close that it startled me, for I had
                  heard no footstep, said:</p>
               <p>"'Enjoy that glorious view, my young friend; you cannot always have such before
                  you in this changeable world.'</p>
               <p>"I turned quickly around, and observed a tall, grave-looking elderly man, one
                  whose look, though sad, seemed to be full of kindness and wisdom. An air of gentle
                  dignity marked his demeanor. Observing my surprise, he continued:</p>
               <p>"'You do not know me, Ernest Cramer, yet, from the stormy hour which ushered you
                  into life, up to the present moment, I have watched your career; have seen you in
                  adversity and prosperity, in peril and in safety, in turmoil and in strife, peace
                  and security. I have seen some traits in your character of which I approve, but
                     <emph>much</emph> that I must condemn, and which requires improvement!"</p>
               <p>"Pride and anger joined hands in my breast, and urged me to inquire what right he
                  had to condemn any trait in my character, or to speak so familiarly to me; but an
                  involuntary awe seemed not only to chain me to the spot, but to prevent me giving
                  utterance to my thoughts, or speaking in reply. But he continued, seeming, from
                  his words, to be cognisant of every thought within me.</p>
               <p>"'It is useless,' he said, 'to be angry or impatient, for you <emph>must</emph>
                  listen to me. I have a mission which concerns you, and must be fulfilled.
                     <emph>Alas!</emph> that I could not always be with you; but there is another
                  who was born in the same dark and stormy hour of terror as yourself, and to him I
                  have also duties to perform. You are wondering who I am. I am a guardian spirit
                  sent from Heaven to aid and guard, and if possible, save you, for a dark and
                  clouded life is before you, I fear. You smile; you believe me not; you scorn the
                  thought that spirits from another world can hold converse with mortals, or at
                  certain exigencies be permitted to assume real shapes. Reach out your hand to
                  touch me, and be convinced!'</p>
               <p>"I did so; and though he seemed to stand there, I could feel nothing. I shuddered,
                  trembled, and <emph>could not but believe</emph> He then continued</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6961-00000007"/>
               <p>"'My present mission to you is this. You have arrived at an age when
                     <emph>character</emph> is formed; when the <emph>man</emph> is moulded, and I
                  am permitted, by the goodness of HIM who is ALMIGHTY, to lay before you two
                  courses of life, and of these you can make choice.</p>
               <p>"'One leads quietly through a dull level, but pleasant valley where the sun is
                  never very bright, nor the sky ever very dark; where the scene is ever the same,
                  and where, at 'a green old age,' you can lay down, 'wrap the drapery of your couch
                  about you,' and die, wept by a <emph>few</emph>, for to the <emph>many</emph> you
                  will be utterly unknown. Take this road and your epitaph will be—'HERE REPOSES ONE
                  WHO HAD NO ENEMIES.'</p>
               <p>"'The other road is far different. It is over rugged mountains, with but here and
                  there a pleasant resting-place. The sun may sometimes glance out upon you for a
                  moment; but, even while it shines warm upon you, storms will arise, clouds will
                  hide it, and your form, all too frail and slender for such a blast, will be
                  wrapped in the tempest. Your life will be change, <emph>change</emph>,
                  continually. You will be apter to rest in the prison than the palace. Foes will
                  beset you on every hand, meet you at every turn. The feeble will be struggling
                  along the same rough road; as they stumble and stagger over the pointed rocks,
                  along the wild chasms, they will shriek to you for help. If you pause to aid them,
                  your foes will gather around you, aye, and perchance they will destroy you, while
                  you are thus performing noble and Christian acts. The poor and oppressed of the
                  earth whom you will find weeping and fainting by the way-side, will look up to
                  you; if you help them, they will reward you with fervent prayers and grateful
                  blessings, but envious and malignant foes will turn every good act into evil, by
                  their accounts; your best deeds will be veiled by slander and distorted by malice.
                  You <emph>may</emph> pass through all these dangers and difficulties, but it is
                  far more probable that you will perish, as the noblest of your race have done
                  before you, before you can gain the sunshine, the glorious sunshine beyond the
                  last mountain. If you die on the road, your name will be blackened by foes, but
                  those whom you have helped will weep, and in their hearts your monument will be!
                  If you pass all dangers, your triumph will strike a enemies dumb fame, honor,
                  distinction, will be yours; but be warned, the <emph>last</emph> is a narrow and
                  almost hopeless chance! Now choose, but be cautious, for on <emph>one</emph> word
                  depends your future fate!'"</p>
               <p>"As he said this, I awoke, and found that I had been dreaming, yet for my life I
                  cannot banish the vision from my mind, and I <emph>feel</emph> that from this day
                  I must take a course which will last through life. Which shall I take, Lizzie, the
                  stormy or the pleasant one?'</p>
               <p>"The old gentleman didn't tell you whether you'd have a wife to travel either of
                  the roads with you?"</p>
               <p>"No, you little witch!"</p>
               <p>"Then I can't advise which to take till I know whether you're to be allowed a wife
                  on either of them—dream again to-night, and come down to breakfast now!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot eat;—what a <emph>strange</emph> dream!"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, I'm sure you're in <emph>love!</emph> Now tell me, who is it? Is it Miss
                  Smith, or Miss Brown, or widow Jenkins or—"</p>
               <p>"Yourself, Lizzie? That was what you intended to ask next!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, la, no! I'm too young to be <emph>loved</emph>, and—and, I'm sure the
                     <emph>breakfast</emph> is <emph>cold!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The young girl, rendered still more beautiful by a blush and a confusion as
                  natural as her own character, turned from the room, and singing gaily, "I'm over
                  young to marry yet," hurried down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cramer remained in the room, occasionally giving utterance to his thoughts,
                  arguing and advising with himself.</p>
               <p>"It is plain"—he said "Yes, I have a choice—a choice between inglorious ease and
                  personal comfort—a life of uselessness and selfishness; or a life of
                     <emph>glorious</emph> strife. 'Tis braver to battle with the ills of life than
                  to avoid them; 'tis nobler to combat vice and wrong and oppression, than to live
                  for self alone; my choice is made—the field for <emph>labor</emph> is large. The
                  ill-paid artisan; the starving sewing girl; the wronged factory operatives, loaded
                  down with oppression by monied monopolists; my dear country burdened with taxation
                  to support paupers <emph>imported</emph> from foreign climes; labor rendered
                  cheaper and more difficult to obtain by the beggarly competition of these
                  foreign-born serfs; the blighting and dangerous influence of combined<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000008"/> ed and secret associations of foreigners; the plot
                  of a sect who de sign to make this country the strong-hold and garden of Popery,
                  and by electing their own members to public offices and power, to yet link their
                  church with our National and State Governments; the gambling hells and dens of
                  robbery and putridity in our cities; the prostitution of Justice; the barter and
                  sale of all our dearest rights!—oh! in all <emph>this</emph>, is there not a
                  field, glorious, even as it is a dangerous field for <emph>ambition</emph> to
                  enter upon, for a bold, true-hearted lover of common humanity to labor in! Sink or
                  swim, <emph>that</emph> field <emph>shall</emph> be <emph>mine!</emph> If I
                  fail—it shall not be for want of <emph>trying;</emph> if I fall, it shall be with
                  my feet to the foe and my face to the sun!</p>
               <p>"And now I think I'll go to breakfast. I wonder if it is cold?"</p>
               <p>Suiting his actions to his words, as he closed his soliloquy, the young man left
                  the room.</p>

               <p>A YEAR later. "Time changes all things," or at least so goes the old adage, and we
                  can in everything meet its verification. A year ago we saw Ernest Cramer in a
                  little attic, his appearance denoting poverty, his situation evidently nigh akin
                  to penury. We will see what change a year has wrought for him.</p>
               <p>It is evening—an evening in December, and the wind is heard whistling shrilly out
                  of doors, and sleet dashes against the window panes. Within a snug back parlor,
                  seated at a centre-table which is drawn near to a cheerful fire, he sits, engaged
                  in writing, with a pile of manuscript before him. Letters in one place, sealed and
                  ready for mailing; a large pile of opened correspondence in another, and a roll of
                  "proofs" yet damp from the printer's office, show that his business has increased,
                  though still the same as before. His dress, though plain, is genteel, and not
                  threadbare as it was. The parlor is comfortably furnished, not richly, and the one
                  door of a bed-room adjoining exhibits the wonderful and astonishing fact that one
                  who earns his living by his pen has been enabled to indulge in the extravagance of
                     <emph>two</emph> rooms.</p>
               <p>But look—a servant enters, bearing a large tray filled with eatables, smoking hot.
                  Why really this is <emph>wrong</emph>—out of the way! It's generally the rule for
                  young authors to <emph>starve</emph>, Chatterton like; they are never
                     <emph>appreciated</emph> until like <emph>Coop</emph>—(no I won't incur a libel
                  suit,) until like "some folks" they get grey-headed and stupid With the servant,
                  bearing a couple of candles, appears the same lovely girl whom we took a look at
                  in the first chapter. But even as the slowly budding rose appears more beautiful
                  as it leaf by leaf unfolds, so the year had added beauty to Lizzie. Her form is
                  more full and womanly, her features more <emph>set</emph>, and better defined. Her
                  eye too<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6961-00000009"/> seems more intelligent—brighter,
                  yet it has the same mischievous expression. She has not yet laid aside her short
                  dresses—the coquettish pantalett still half, conceals the slender ancle, and makes
                  that small foot look even smaller than it is. What is prettier than a flower just
                  opening its last leaves into full blossom? What is prettier than a
                     <emph>very</emph> pretty maiden, who is <emph>almost</emph> a woman, and still
                  is in the <emph>bud</emph> of girlhood?</p>
               <p>When the servant placed the tray upon the young man's table she retired, but
                  Lizzie, drawing a chair to the other side of the table, poured out his tea. As she
                  did so, with a sly smile, she asked:</p>
               <p>"Have you had any more dreams lately, Mr. Cramer?"</p>
               <p>"No, Lizzie, this is not a world of dreaming; there are but too many sad
                     <emph>realities</emph> in it!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, there you are in the blues again! I do declare, Mr. Cramer, you're enough to
                  make me turn <emph>nun</emph>—you are always looking at the dark side of
                  everything!"</p>
               <p>"Not always, Lizzie, but my researches during the past year have been well
                  calculated to make me sad. Ah, had you seen what I saw to-day!"</p>
               <p>The young man sipped his tea, buttered a piece of toast, and sighed.</p>
               <p>"Well, what did you see?" asked Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"I saw that, Lizzie, which almost makes me ashamed to sit here in this comfortable
                  room with so much luxury around me!"</p>
               <p>"Why I'm sure, Mr. Cramer, no one has a better right to comfort than you who often
                  write all night long. If you <emph>earn</emph> comforts by your midnight labors,
                  and daily toil, you certainly need not begrudge <emph>yourself!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lizzie, that which is now before me might save human life. I this morning saw
                  a young girl—one as young as you, laying cold and dead on the damp earth. She was
                  thin—thin as a shadow. I read <emph>starvation</emph> written in her sharp
                  features, and then I thought of what her history might have been. Her parents
                  dead; no friends; too timid to beg; too virtuous to do worse; unable to get work;
                  unfit for earth, the cold, heartless earth; just fit for heaven! And yet I
                     <emph>pitied</emph> her!"</p>
               <p>Cramer paused and looked at Lizzie. Two tears shone in her great black eyes, like
                  dew-drops on jet. But when she saw him look at her, she blushed and wiped them
                  away quickly, as if ashamed of them. And then her eyes looked all the brighter
                  that the holy dew of sympathy had been in them. Then, after a moment's pause, she
                  spoke:</p>
               <p>"I forgot to tell you, Mr. Cramer, that while you were out this afternoon, a
                  gentleman called to see you—such a handsome gentleman, too!"</p>
               <p>"A gentleman; did he leave his name?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir: it was Lieutenant—Lieutenant—now what a goose I am! I've forgotten
                  it,—but then he had such handsome eyes! and he was tall, and he wore a moustache
                  which set off his teeth so well!—why don't you wear a moustache, Mr. Cramer,—I do
                  so love a moustache!"</p>
               <p>"Who could it be? Can you not remember his name?" asked <choice>
                     <sic>Camer</sic>
                     <corr>Cramer</corr>
                  </choice>, not heeding her query.</p>
               <p>"No, I've forgotten that; but his eyes were dark blue, and his hair curled; and he
                  had a love of a moustache, and red pouting lips,—I almost wanted to kiss
                  them!"</p>
               <p>"You shall, pretty miss, if you want to!" said a manly voice at the door, which
                  stood ajar, and at the same time it was pushed open by the speaker, a tall, fine
                  looking young man, dressed in an undress military uniform.</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! 'tis himself—he <emph>heard</emph> me!" cried the girl, turning red as a
                  full blown carnation, and starting back as if she wanted to find some place to
                  hide herself in.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, never mind—speak of—you know who, and he's sure to pop up before
                  you!" said the soldier with a laugh, and as he advanced, he extended his hand to
                  Cramer, exclaiming, "How are you, Ernest, my boy—I'm deuced glad to see you!"</p>
               <p>Cramer arose, looking confused, but did not seem to recognise his visitor; while
                  Lizzie took advantage of the chance, and "slipped" out of the room</p>
               <p>"What!" cried the officer, "have you forgotten <emph>me?</emph>—Harry Hilton, your
                  old school-mate?"</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6961-00000010"/>
               <p>"Why, Harry! God bless you, is that you?" and as Cramer uttered this exclamation,
                  he sprang forward, and met his friend's grasp with one full as hearty. "Why, bless
                  your soul, how you have altered: you used to be slim and pale!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; who wouldn't be, poring over books and—oh, I beg your pardon, Ernest, I
                  didn't mean to be personal, but if you want color and health, there's nothing like
                  field life!"</p>
               <p>"You have been in Mexico; have seen hard service: I saw your name mentioned
                  creditably in dispatches, but I didn't expect to see you here; to tell the truth,
                  I had almost forgotten you!" said Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, that's the way; in mind to-day, out of it to-morrow; but go on with
                  your supper; don't let me disturb you!"</p>
               <p>"You do not: won't you join me? I'll ring the bell!"</p>
               <p>"No; I've just left the table. But, speaking of the <emph>bell</emph>, who was
                  that <foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle</foreign> who has just retreated from the camp?
                  She's deuced pretty!"</p>
               <p>"And as good as she is pretty. She is my landlady's daughter: you made quite an
                  impression, it seems, when you called first; but coming in so suddenly now, you
                     <unclear>frightened</unclear> her off!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm sorry for that; but I wanted to surprise you; and so when the servant
                  let me in from the street just now, I told her I was an old friend; and telling me
                  which your room was, she let me come up."</p>
               <p>"You did surprise me, you have <unclear>altered</unclear> so. Do you intend to
                  stay long in the city?"</p>
               <p>"Yes: I've come here to recruit: my company which was eighty strong, when we began
                  the campaign, only eighteen months ago, is now as bad off as Falstaff's was; it
                  only numbers about twenty, and they are lean, lame and ragged. My captain has gone
                  home to recruit his health, and the second lieutenant ran away with a Newport
                  heiress last week to recruit his finances; so you see we're <emph>all</emph> on
                     <emph>recruiting</emph> service!"</p>
               <p>"I read in the papers that you were badly wounded! Was the report untrue?"</p>
               <p>"No; I did get about an ounce of lead in me; but old Boneset, our surgeon, cut it
                  out on the opposite from where it went in, and after a couple of months laying by,
                  I got about, and was all ready for another dose; but after that there wasn't such
                  good luck, though I saw better men than me shot down by my side!"</p>
               <p>"Modest as ever, I see, Harry!"</p>
               <p>"None of your jokes, Ernest: I <emph>am</emph> modest, you know I am, and as
                  bashful as a miss in her teens, especially—"</p>
               <p>"When you offer to kiss a young lady to whom you have never been introduced, and
                  have seen but once before!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Ernest, you have me there; but then I didn't know that you'd a pre-emption
                  claim in that quarter!"</p>
               <p>"Nor do you know so now! Lizzie is no more to me than a kind friend! She's but a
                  school-girl yet; and besides, I shall never marry."</p>
               <p>"Lord! what a sigh you said that with! you haven't forgot your early sweetheart,
                  rosy-cheeked Helen, eh?"</p>
               <p>"No; nor do I think I ever shall: the road I have chosen through life, is too dark
                  and strange for me to wish to link another in the same fate."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Your</emph> life dark! You surprise me! Why I was envying you your
                  prospects. Here you are, only a boy, as I might say, and yet your works sell; you
                  are gaining a name; and your income must certainly be enough to keep you above
                  want. And when you reflect that this is all owing to your own efforts; for I know
                  you have had no aid from others; and that you, while yet so young, have opened
                  upon a career so full of promise, I think you should be anything but sad. Were I
                  you, I'd get married, and enjoy life as I went along. For me, a poor devil of a
                  soldier, here to-day and away to-morrow one year on the seaboard, frollicking with
                  the gayest belles of fashion, the next a hundred miles beyond sunset, with no one
                  to make love to but a stockingless squaw, whose only looking-glass is a
                  water-pond, and whose highest accomplishment is to skin and dress a buffalo; for
                  me whose life is about as roving and a great deal more uncertain than a wandering
                  gipsey's, marriage would be a folly. But for you the case would be different."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Harry, you know not what is before me. You only think<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000011"/> of the success of two or three hastily written
                  works, and think, because they sell well, that I must necessarily be independent
                  and happy?"</p>
               <p>"Well, why shouldn't you?"</p>
               <p>"First, you know the nature of those works. They are written to expose the evils
                  of society; to tell the world the sufferings of the wretched and oppressed; to
                  unveil life as it is; to place the criminal on the pillory of public opinion; to
                  aid those who need aid."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and should you not be happy in such a work?"</p>
               <p>"I might be happy, if each step was one of triumph—if success crowned every
                  effort. But I see death and misery all around me,—I see Justice sleeping, while
                  her shadow is used to veil crime which should be punished—I see a dark and fearful
                  cloud overshadowing the very liberties of my beloved country!"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Ernest?"</p>
               <p>"I scarcely dare tell you, Harry,—yet it is full time that every American knew of
                  America's danger—aye, and was prepared to meet it!"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak in enigmas. I believe I love my country as well as you do; and God
                  knows my life is devoted to her. Come, explain yourself, or I'll think that
                  there's a leak in your upper story!"</p>
               <p>"To save myself from that imputation I will. You are aware that there is a secret
                  society composed entirely of <emph>Americans</emph>, are you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have heard that you belong to it—in fact, your works have ever advocated
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they have, Harry, and for the past year with pen and voice, by day and by
                  night have I worked for it, aye, and prayed for it, to the neglect of my own soul,
                  perhaps. And for what have I done this? For my own personal benefit?
                     <emph>No;</emph> for in a republican land like this, the first cry raised
                  against such an association would be that it was
                  <emph>anti-republican</emph>—narrow-minded and ungenerous, and to advocate such,
                  would tend to make me unpopular, would tend to injure my pecuniary interest."</p>
               <p>"True, some mighty reason must influence you in your course—for, to speak candidly
                  at the first glance, such a society does look rather anti-republican! You know
                  that our land is professedly the home for the oppressed—the refuge for the exiled
                  victims of tyranny!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and if all who came here, came as exiles of tyranny; if all who came here
                  came merely to share in our freedom—to partake of the blessing which WASHINGTON
                  left us, and the bounty which God Almighty in a fruitful land showers upon us—if
                  they came here as <emph>brothers</emph> and <emph>friends</emph>, I would perish
                  before I would join an association that should exclude them, or any men who,
                     <emph>as</emph> men, sought freedom and freedom's blessings! But I have
                  discovered more than that in the flood of emigration from tyranny's shore. I have
                  learned that a Power that is growing weak on the worn-out and too-long used soil
                  of Europe, is being transplanted here—is even now growing up rapidly in the garden
                  of liberty, and if we are not on our guard, every native flower in that garden
                  will soon be crowded from its birth-place, and the intruders will have taken root
                  to its utter exclusion!"</p>
               <p>"Don't be so mysterious, Ernest. A little less poetry and figure, and a little
                  more sense, as I remarked when I told a lady that I liked roast beef better than I
                  did whipped syllabub!"</p>
               <p>"You know how the Jesuits are dreaded in Europe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they've been driven from several kingdoms!"</p>
               <p>"And all of those who have been driven from there have found a home here! They
                  were driven from there because their only aim was power—<emph>power!</emph> They
                  have ever sought to link church and state together, so as to gain power. Through
                  the confessional, through the means of wealth gained by every contrivance which
                  human ingenuity could invent, they have aimed at gaining power! From the time of
                  the infamous Borgias to the present hour, they have been gradually losing ground
                  in Europe, but since the time of the revolution, which made this country free, and
                  it began to develope its boundless resources and natural wealth, they have been
                  gradually working their way into a foothold here. Here, on this soil rendered holy
                  by patriot blood, they mean to erect their strong-hold; here, by the means of
                  wealth, policy and deep cunning, they mean to gain such a position that they may
                  obtain a complete control, and then, when once at the<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000012"/> helm of state, when once freedom is chained by the
                  gilded bonds they are preparing for her—<emph>America will be no more</emph>—and
                     '<emph>Rome will howl</emph>'—for <emph>here Rome will be!</emph> You smile,
                  Harry, but would you smile if I told you that <emph>now</emph> in the United
                  States there is a secret society composed of this very class numbering over one
                  million souls; that it is led and governed by priests and bishops; that its wealth
                  is immense, and that already it begins to exert an immense influence upon our
                  elections; and that in some of our highest offices of state its members have
                  already occupied places?"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible! Are you sure you are not mistaken?"</p>
               <p>"In the existence of the society I am <emph>not</emph> mistaken! In the extent of
                  its numbers I may be somewhat, but it is very extensive. It has branches in every
                  city of the Union. It is composed of foreigners of every clime, and I fear that
                  for its own evil purposes it has <emph>deluded</emph> some of my own countrymen.
                  With the German it has one name, with the Irish another, and so with each nation,
                  yet all are under one head. To counteract the baneful influence and terrible
                  designs of such an association, have I advocated and urged and labored for the
                  establishment of <emph>American</emph> societies, secret like their own, that we
                  can in secret lay our plans to meet and controvert designs made by them in secret
                  to prostrate that which it cost our forefathers so much to establish!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot feel satisfied yet, Ernest. Can you not give me some proof of the intent
                  of the Jesuits, to make this country their stronghold?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I can. You have seen or heard of the struggle which they had to have
                  their own version of the bible used in our public schools, and which through their
                  influence has caused the separation of school monies, so as to give them schools
                  exclusively for themselves. Into these schools they use every exertion to get
                  American children, so as to shape their educations to suit their own purposes.
                  They have established colleges all over the Union, where, by placing Professors of
                  superior learning and tact, and offering great inducements, they procure the
                  opportunities of educating many of the scions of our first families, knowing that
                  these very young men will yet be Statesmen, and be likely to hold a powerful sway
                  in our national government ernment. And they shape the educations of these young
                  men to suit their aims, bring around them a thousand pleasant influences which,
                  while they lull suspicion, are used as chloroform to hide an operation of a deep
                  and perilous nature, perilous only if it <emph>fails</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Knowing the influence of <emph>woman</emph>—they have established convents for
                  the education of the daughters of our first families. Were not the daughters of a
                  person who has often been spoken of as a candidate for the Presidency of this
                  Union, a man who yet will be its President, or I am no prophet, educated at a
                  convent; and to gain a strong-hold upon him and his, was not one of them induced
                  to take the veil, and become a nun, that in time she may be a 'Lady Abbess,' and
                  use a powerful influence under the command of her <emph>Superiors</emph>, for in
                  that order there is no <emph>equality?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"And do not the Jesuit priests, <emph>in</emph> the confessional and
                     <emph>out</emph> of it, exercise an influence over the political actions of
                  those who believe that these <emph>men</emph> can pardon all earthly sin, or
                  condemn them to hell by refusing <emph>absolution?</emph> Do not these Jesuits
                  encourage the emigration of the ignorant people whom they can sway, aid in getting
                  them here and forming exclusive colonies of them in different parts of the
                  country? Do they not flood the land with their cunningly written books? Have they
                  not even named a Bishop of their own sect, and spoken openly of him for the
                  highest office which he could get in the state where he dwelt? Is there
                     <emph>nothing</emph> in <emph>all</emph> this?"</p>
               <p>"There <emph>must</emph> be something!" replied the young officer, seriously.
                  "But, Ernest, it cannot be that <emph>Americans</emph>—that the descendants of the
                  exiled Puritans and persecuted Huguenots will blindly permit such a stupendous
                  danger to grow up in their midst!"</p>
               <p>"They will, unless awakened in time, to that danger! They have a foe to deal with,
                  which, in centuries of existence, has gained experience; which, in turn, has used
                  every weapon, hypocrisy and openness; fire, sword, wealth and cunning; stopping at
                  nothing which tended to advance its interests."</p>
               <p>"But it is the same which, by persecution, drove them bleeding from the shores of
                  Europe!"</p>
               <p>"True, but it comes here in another dress. It has a mask on—<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000013"/> though it is a <emph>devil</emph>, it tries to look
                  like an <emph>angel</emph>, and it's only when the mask is torn off that they will
                  recognise their old tormentor, and much I fear that it will retain the mask until
                  it has them all in its power!"</p>
               <p>"What do you think would be done, were that society to get into power, were they
                  once to have our government in their hands?"</p>
               <p>"What would be done? Rather ask what <emph>would not</emph> be done! I'll paint a
                  picture for you. It is well known that the Jesuits have <emph>ever</emph> been the
                  bitterest foes of liberty; they have fostered tyranny; their very religion is
                  despotic in its tyranny. They sway the souls and bodies of their followers. They
                  gain the upper hand in this country by filling it with their foreign slaves, and
                  by corrupting our citizens. Then this continent becomes one vast
                     <emph>empire</emph> of Popery. A crowned POPE, with <emph>temporal</emph> power
                  as well as spiritual, sits at Washington, or the place that <emph>was</emph>
                  Washington, for it will then be re-christened <emph>Rome!</emph> Liberty will have
                  fled shrieking beyond our borders. The vast resources of this land will rest in
                  the hands of those who can away an army of five millions of
                     <emph>enthusiasts</emph>, men who know but <emph>one</emph> will and
                     <emph>one</emph> way, and that the will of one of the successors of
                     <emph>Alexander Borgia!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It cannot be—if it can, it <emph>must not!</emph>" muttered the young
                  soldier.</p>
               <p>"God in heaven prevent it!" responded Cramer. "And yet, I see the cloud of danger
                  in the horizon. Everything seems portentous of a storm! The Jesuits cannot hold
                  their own in Rome, or in Europe; by every ship, societies of their monks and their
                  nuns arrive. Show me a town, or a village of any note in the Union, where they
                  have not planted their standard!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I fear that you are more than half right, Ernest; but are you not in
                  personal danger from those pests of society, the gamblers and drunkard-makers,
                  whom you strike so sharply in your writings?"</p>
               <p>"No; they are rendered cowardly by their guilt; they cannot harm me. Like a dog
                  that is beaten, they howl at my blows; like the same animal growling when a bone
                  is snatched from him, they grumble when I rescue a victim from their fiendish
                  toils; but that is all!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Ernest, every one to their taste, but I wouldn't like to stand in your
                  shoes. I have physical courage enough for a soldier, but to carry on such a
                  warfare as you are waging, requires a <emph>moral</emph> courage which few are
                  willing to exercise, even if they do possess it! But I see that you spare
                     <emph>no</emph> offenders; you speak as fearlessly of judges, police officers,
                  and prosecuting officers, as you do of thieves and gamblers!"</p>
               <p>"Why should I not? aye, why not be even <emph>more</emph> severe upon such of them
                  as prostitute their offices for gain; or swayed by self-interest, either wink at
                  crime, or else by their decisions and conduct, openly encourage it?"</p>
               <p>"But you cannot hope to accomplish such reforms as you propose, alone, and it is
                  against the spirit of the age to <emph>aid</emph> you!"</p>
               <p>"Of course, I do not expect to do it alone; but I do expect and hope to call the
                  attention of the PEOPLE to these things, and by so doing, to enlist others who are
                  more able and talented than I, in the cause of right. Your experience has taught
                  you that in every attack, some one must take the <emph>lead</emph> in a charge;
                  some one must dash forward to encourage the rest!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ernest, but almost always have I seen such leaders fall, either wounded or
                  slain!"</p>
               <p>"But the rest had <emph>started</emph>, their blood was up, they pressed on to
                  avenge the fallen, did they not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is true!"</p>
               <p>"Then am I <emph>willing</emph> to be a <emph>martyr</emph> in the cause of Right,
                  if by my fall I can only cause others to press on in the holy warfare. If I can
                  make <emph>Americans</emph> look to the interests of their country; if I can cause
                     <emph>men</emph> to look for themselves into the wrongs which oppress them; to
                  themselves meet the insidious foes which, under the guise of
                  "<emph>friends</emph>," are eating up their very hearts, then am I
                     <emph>willing</emph> to <emph>perish!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You're a strange fellow, Ernest; what caused you to take up these ideas?"</p>
               <p>"Three things. First, my natural disposition to resist wrong and oppression, a
                  disposition which runs in the blood of my family, for,<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000014"/> upon nearly every battle field of the Revolution
                  has the blood of that family been shed. Second: long thought and experience; for
                  young as I am, I have battled with life's troubles since my earliest childhood,
                  and whether I willed it or not, have been forced into a <emph>man's</emph> place
                  to do a <emph>man's</emph> duty, though in years but a boy. Last, but not least, I
                  entered into my present course through the influence of a <emph>dream!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A <emph>dream?</emph> What do you mean? I myself, chose the military profession
                  in consequence of a dream."</p>
               <p>"When were you born, Harry?" Asked Cramer, abruptly and anxiously.</p>
               <p>"On the 20th of March, 18—; but what of that?" replied Hilton.</p>
               <p>"Much, much!" responded Cramer. "You say that you had a dream. Did not an old man
                  appear to you once, offering you a choice of your course through life?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but who told you that?"</p>
               <p>"No one; but he who appeared to me in a dream, which has certainly influenced my
                  course of life, told me that he had another to watch over, one who was ushered
                  into this black and stormy world at the same moment as myself. I, too, was born on
                  the same day with you; but tell me your dream?"</p>
               <p>"It is short. After I left college, to which you wouldn't go, you remember, my
                  father placed me with lawyer B—, to study, intending to have me adopt the legal
                  profession. Well, I found it a deuced dry and sleepy business, and often fell
                  asleep over Blackstone and Chitty, as I sat in the back office in Nassau street.
                  One afternoon, when engaged in that way, I dreamed that an old fellow came to me,
                  and told me that I could continue that life, and eventually rise to eminence, or,
                  I could become a soldier, and win great renown as a warrior, for the harvest of
                  warriors was at hand. After I woke up, I went to <emph>thinking</emph>, (something
                     <emph>new</emph> for me, in those days,) and <emph>thought</emph> drove law
                     <emph>out</emph> of my head, and cockades and glory into it. So I concluded to
                  face about, become a soldier, and take the chances of winning a grave instead of
                  promotion!"</p>
               <p>"You preferred that, to eminence as an orator, a lawyer, perchance as a
                  statesman?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Certainly</emph>, what do lawyers live upon but the troubles and quarrels
                  of others?"</p>
               <p>"What else do soldiers live upon, only they add <emph>killing</emph> to the
                  trade!" said Cramer with a smile.</p>
               <p>"But, Ernest," replied the soldier, "<emph>we</emph> kill <emph>decently;</emph>
                  we don't rob a fellow of all that makes life worth having, and then worry or
                  starve him to death!"</p>
               <p>"That is true. Law is not always <emph>justice</emph>, and too often it is twisted
                  into nets to enslave <emph>innocence;</emph> nets which those who <emph>are</emph>
                  guilty can either evade or break!"</p>
               <p>"Well—well, Ernest, do you drop your philosophising, or I shall get the blues.
                  I've paid you my first visit—but I've a call to make this evening on a family to
                  which I have a message from an absent friend, and I wish you'd go along. It is
                  early, and a walk will do you good; 'twill put color in your cheeks!"</p>
               <p>"I wish you'd excuse me, Harry, I've an address to prepare!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, let your address go to thunder, for to-night; come, I want to talk to you and
                  we can talk as we go along, and besides if she hasn't altered amazingly since I
                  left, you'll see one of the prettiest girls in the city!"</p>
               <p>"That reason, Harry, would have no influence with me, for as I told you before,
                  beauty is nothing to me. I do not intend to divide my mind, or separate it from
                  the one great object I have in view, therefore, I cannot <emph>marry</emph>. I
                     <emph>will not</emph> be a libertine, therefore woman's beauty can be no more
                  to me than the flowers which grow by the way-side, which I cannot turn aside to
                  pluck. I can admire them from a distance, but a passing glance is all that I can
                  bestow on them."</p>
               <p>"Well, take the walk with me, at any rate. You certainly can afford to tear
                     <unclear>yourself</unclear> away from labor for one evening for an old friend
                  like myself!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Harry, yes, you are right. I was selfish, and besides are we not brothers of
                  birth-time!"</p>
               <p>"Brothers at <emph>heart</emph>, at any rate!" said the young soldier, lighting<pb

                  walk. "I'll tell you," he added, "as we go along, a story about this same old man
                  who seems to take such an interest in our welfare. I saw him in Mexico—saw him
                  when I was wounded at Cherubusco!"</p>
               <p>"Strange, I cannot believe in SPIRITS, yet it seemed <emph>so</emph> real when I
                  saw him!" said Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Ernest, it <emph>was</emph> real! I am satisfied of it—but let us go, it is late
                  and we'll talk as we go along. I want you to see '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">La Belle
                     Serena</foreign>,' as I used to call Miss Serena Clifford, the Belle of

               <p>A lovelier woman than Serena Clifford never trod God's footstool. Her features
                  were not classical, but yet they possessed a combination of different beauties,
                  which united in rendering her countenance most expressive—most angelic, most
                  transcendently lovely. Her forehead was of a medium height, slightly oval, and
                  white as alabaster—and the dark, arched eye-brows lay like delicate pencillings
                  above her dark, blue eyes—eyes, large, liquid, meltingly soulful. Her face was
                  full—on her cheek lay the lovely carnation hue of health—her ripe lips were of the
                  cupid-bow curve, her round fair chin slightly dimpled. Her figure, of medium
                  height, was full, rather fuller than fashionable belles like theirs to be, but it
                  was faultless. Her hands and feet were small enough to have pleased a Byron—her
                  air was at once graceful and dignified.</p>
               <p>At the moment when I choose to introduce her, she was alone in the splendidly
                  furnished parlor of her father's mansion, in Japonica Place. She was seated by a
                  centre table, engaged in reading, no other person being in the room. Her lovely
                  head resting on one hand, which was supported by her elbow resting on the table,
                  and her ringlets of dark, glossy brown hair hid her hand from view. As she
                  read—you could gather from the varying shades which came and went upon her
                  countenance, that her very soul was communing with the author, that she
                     <emph>felt</emph> what she was reading. And further to evince how deep is her
                  feeling, we have but to watch her a little while. See, as she pores over the work,
                  how her pinken nostrils distend and close, how her curved lip quivers, how her
                  voluptuous bosom <unclear>heaves</unclear> under its covering. Ah—what so touches
                  her—she bursts into tears—and for long minutes with her head bowed over the work,
                  sobs and weeps bitterly. But hark—a ring, loud and quick, as by some familiar
                  hand, at the bell of the street door, startles her, and she springs to her feet,
                  hastily wiping her eyes.</p>
               <p>Scarce a minute passes, but she is calm before the parlor door is opened. Two
                  gentlemen enter. Hear her musical voice, how clear yet how richly soft and sweet,
                  as she steps forward with extended hand, and exclaims:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Hilton, I am <emph>so</emph> glad to see you! I heard that you had
                  arrived, but did not flatter myself that you would favor us with so early a
                  call!"</p>
               <p>She had spoken these words before she appeared to observe that Hilton had company,
                  but as she saw a person with him, and also noticed that he was a stranger, she
                  colored slightly and drew up her stately form which had been bent forward to meet
                  her visitor.</p>
               <p>"Permit me to introduce my friend, Mr. Cramer, to you, Miss Serena!" said Hilton
                  quickly, to relieve her from confusion.</p>
               <p>"Mr. <emph>Ernest</emph> Cramer?" she asked quickly, as she bowed gracefully.</p>
               <p>"Mr. <emph>Ernest</emph> Cramer!" replied Hilton, smiling at the earnest manner in
                  which she asked the question.</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>very</emph> happy to see you, sir," said she, again bowing. "Pray be
                  seated, for I wish to scold you!"</p>
               <p>"In what, fair lady, have I been so unfortunate as to offend you?" asked
                  Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Come here, sir, and look," she said half seriously, half playfully, advancing to
                  the centre-table and pointing to the work she had been reading, which still lay
                  open. "Do you see those leaves?" she continued: "They are wet with tears; I have
                  been crying like a child over the fate of that poor sewing girl!"</p>
               <p>"You flatter me, lady—highly honor me in even reading one of my poor productions;
                  but if I have been so fortunate as to interest you in the fate of a pictured one
                  of our city unfortunates, I am doubly flattered!"</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6961-00000016"/>
               <p>"Don't speak of flattery, Mr. Cramer, or I shall think you are fishing for a
                  compliment."</p>
               <p>"I could receive no higher compliment on earth, lady, than that conveyed in the
                  tears of sensibility"—replied the young author, and then, blushing at his own
                  temerity, he added—"How like, you ladies are to the lovely flowers with which God
                  beautifies the earth. As they are fresher and fairer after being washed by the
                  gentle rains of heaven or the mild dews of evening, so is your sex loveliest after
                  tears have but a moment passed away and given place to the sunny light of a
                  smile."</p>
               <p>"I have always heard that poets were flatterers, and now I believe it!" cried the
                  lady, and then, with ready tact, to prevent his making a reply, she turned quickly
                  to his companion, and cried; "How is your health, Mr. Hilton? I suppose I should
                  call you <emph>Lieutenant</emph> now, though. Have you entirely recovered from
                  your wounds?"</p>
               <p>"Quite, from all, except one that you gave me in the heart, before I left, with a
                  glance from your bright eyes!" said the soldier gaily.</p>
               <p>"There is little danger to be apprehended from that!" she replied—"soldiers, if
                  report speaks true, have pin-cushion hearts, and can manage to have an hundred
                  such darts as you allude to fastened in them, without any trouble or
                  inconvenience!"</p>
               <p>"A slander on the service, I assure you, fair Serena! Soldiers are not of a
                  coquettish nature at all. They are the most constant beings in the world!"</p>
               <p>"Constant to the glorious flag of their country, I will admit, but in love, fickle
                  as the breath of the whirling wind!"</p>
               <p>"Are you an American, Miss Serena?" asked Ernest—"I supposed from your accent that
                  you was—"</p>
               <p>"A foreigner," said the lady, finishing the remark for him. "I am a daughter of
                  England's rocky isle, but I love to see and speak of the noble patriotism
                  displayed by those who serve under our National Standard. I glory in hearing and
                  reading of the gallant deeds of our heroes, who under the noble-hearted 'Rough and
                  Ready,' and the gallant Scott, have covered themselves with glory—given new
                  brilliancy to the stars of Freedom's flag. I love <emph>my</emph> country dearly
                  —love it as the soil of my birth, as the home of my fathers—but <emph>next</emph>
                  to it I love this country!"</p>
               <p>"You have long lived here, have you not?"</p>
               <p>"Since I was a mere child. I have but a dim recollection of my native land—still I
                  love it, love it and venerate it, as a child does a mother from which it has long
                  been separated—love it as the poet must have loved his country, who wrote my
                  favorite song, 'Erin is my home,' one of Dempster's sweetest ballads!"</p>
               <p>"It is a sweet song—would I be exacting too great a favor in asking you to sing
                  it?" said Cramer.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do</emph>, Miss Serena; it is long since I heard softer music than the drum
                  and trumpet!" added Hilton.</p>
               <p>"I am not so <emph>fashionable</emph> as to require much pressing," said the lady,
                  moving with inimitable grace to the piano. After a rapid prelude, which shewed her
                  complete mastery of the instrument, in a full, melodious voice, which gave clear
                  utterance to every note of the music, she sung the ballad, <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Oh I have roamed in many lands,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And many friends I've met;</l>
                        <l>Not one fair scene, or kindly smile</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Can this fond heart forget;</l>
                        <l>But I'll confess that I'm content,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">No more I wish to roam;</l>
                        <l>Oh steer my bark to Erin's Isle,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For Erin is my home!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>If England were my place of birth,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I'd love her tranquil shore,</l>
                        <l>And if Columbia were my home</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Her freedom I'd adore;</l>
                        <l>Tho' pleasant days, in both I pass,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I dream of days to come;</l>
                        <l>Oh steer my bark to Erin's Isle,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For Erin is my home."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For a minute after she struck the last note on the piano, and the last word left
                  her lips, both the gentlemen sat silent and spell-bound,<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000017"/> as if listening for the deep thrilling echoes of
                  her voice, reverberating through their very souls. Cramer was the first to
                  speak.</p>
               <p>"You must be very fond of music, lady. You seem to <emph>feel</emph> it: I never
                  heard that ballad sung with such exquisite pathos before!"</p>
               <p>"Much depends upon the poetry, Mr. Cramer, which if it is feeling in itself, is
                  sure to produce feeling in the singer. Permit me to sing another song—the music is
                  simple, composed by myself; but you will excuse that!"</p>
               <p>Again the lovely fingers ran over the piano; but the prelude this time was sad and
                  slow. What was Cramer's pleasure and astonishment when he heard her commence one
                  of his own little poems, and in a voice tremulous with emotion, she gave an
                  expression to the words which he never before believed they possessed. She
                  finished, and he was about to speak, when more company was announced, and to his
                  pain, he found that he could no longer claim so large a share of her attention;
                  for Hilton, like a sensible fellow as he was, had, when Ernest was conversing with
                  her, been apparently very intent in overhauling the pages of Godey's last
                  Magazines, which lay upon the table as another proof of the good taste of Miss
                  Clifford. But Ernest's surprise was still more enhanced to see with what ease and
                  grace she divided her attention with her company; how she managed to mingle her
                  conversation with each, so as to interest and please all, doing it too without any
                  apparent effort.</p>
               <p>In spite of the overplus of company, the evening passed rapidly and delightfully,
                  and it was eleven o'clock before Ernest thought it was nine. With an effort, (for
                  he could have listened to her all night) he reminded Hilton of the hour and the
                  distance they had to walk, and arose to leave.</p>
               <p>The lady accompanied them to the door, and as Ernest stood with the lady's hand in
                  his own, he fancied he felt a slight pressure, as she said:</p>
               <p>"Do visit us again, Mr. Cramer,—come <emph>soon</emph>, and often; you will always
                  be welcome!"</p>
               <p>He raised that fair hand to his lips and kissed it. He would have done so if death
                  had been the penalty. He could not help it. But the lady did not rebuke him: she
                  only blushed till her fair brow looked like a snow-bank reddened by the setting
                  sun. He replied to her that he would feel deep pleasure in calling early, and left
                  the house, with his very brain whirling with the various thoughts which passed
                  through it.</p>
               <p>"Well, Ernest, my boy, what do you think of La Belle Serena?" cried Hilton, as
                  soon as they were fairly out of ear-shot of the door.</p>
               <p>"How old is she?" was the singular reply of Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Twenty one, or two,—but that's a strange answer to my question. What do you think
                  of her?"</p>
               <p>"Are you engaged to that lady?—answer me seriously, Harry, for on your reply
                  depends my future happiness: if you <emph>are</emph> engaged to her, say so, and I
                  have visited her for the <emph>last</emph> time!" continued Cramer, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"No, I am not, Ernest, but from your manner I think you would like to be. Well,
                  good luck to you! She is the noblest specimen of a woman in the world; and you
                  seem to have made an impression already. The <emph>pen</emph> is indeed more
                  powerful than the <emph>sword</emph> with woman!"</p>
               <p>"May it always be so! What has women in her nature that is consonant with deeds of
                  rapine and slaughter?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," replied Hilton: "but why does woman ever love and admire
                  valor?"</p>
               <p>"Because the brave are ever most ready to defend her and her rights; because noble
                  Valor and gentle Love are, singular as it may seem, twin spirits!"</p>
               <p>"Well turned, by my honor! But even yet you haven't answered my question: What do
                  you think of Miss Clifford?"</p>
               <p>"I think that in beauty of person she has no equal living—that she is as
                  accomplished in mind, as feeling and eloquent (if I may use the expression) in
                     <emph>soul</emph>, as she is lovely in person. Harry, do you believe in love at
                  first sight?"</p>
               <p>"If I had always been a disbeliever in that principle, I should have been
                  converted to-night. I can see, without looking, that you love Serena!"</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6961-00000018"/>
               <p>"Yes, deeply, wildly, devotedly; with a love which can never change! Oh, Harry,
                  from this hour I have entered upon a new life! A new world seems to open before
                  me, and she is the only star which lights it up,—yet how beautiful, how brilliant
                  it is!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I am glad of it, Ernest. I love you as a brother, and I could not wish you
                  a greater happiness on earth than that of wedding Serena Clifford. She is pure,
                  high-minded, devoted and affectionate. A nobler woman never vowed before God's
                  holy altar to love and cherish a husband. I hope you may win and wear her!"</p>
               <p>This conversation is becoming dull to you, I fear, reader, so we'll stop our ears,
                  till the two young gentlemen reach the boarding-house of Cramer.</p>
               <p>As they stood before the door, hand in hand, ready to separate for the night,
                  Cramer asked:</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with yourself to-morrow night, Harry?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing in particular: do you wish so soon to renew your visit of this
                  evening?"</p>
               <p>"No; I am already engaged: I have an address to deliver before a branch of the
                  American Order to which I belong. I should like to have you hear it: it is upon a
                  good subject,—America as it <emph>was, is</emph>, and <emph>may be!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But I do not belong to the Order: can I gain admittance?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. We do not fear to explain our principles to the world. It is only
                  necessary for an American to hear and understand them, to gain him as a convert to
                  our cause. Only our business and regular official meetings of the Order are
                     <emph>secret:</emph> when an address is to be delivered, explanatory of the
                  principles, we throw wide open our doors, and invite <emph>all</emph>, native and
                  foreign, to hear <emph>truths</emph> which cannot be controverted! You will go
                  with me to-morrow night, will you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ernest, I will, with pleasure. I want to hear you speak But it is late; I
                  will bid you good night!"</p>
               <p>"Good night! God bless you, my dear fellow!"</p>
               <p>And thus the March-born separated.</p>
               <p>Ernest stood for a few moments on the door-step, gazing at the tall, manly form of
                  his friend as he passed up the street, and then turning to the door, gently
                  ringing the bell. The door was opened by sweet Lizzie Laurel.</p>
               <p>"Why, how late you are to-night, Mr. Cramer!" she exclaimed "You've not been
                  courting I hope?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you <emph>hope</emph> I haven't, Lizzie?"</p>
               <p>"I didn't say I hoped not; but—but I thought you always said you never meant to
                  get married! But tell me, <emph>have</emph> you been to see a lady?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"A lady that you mean to marry? Tell me, Mr. Cramer, have you <emph>really</emph>
                  been courting?" asked the young girl, with an earnestness which evinced that she
                  felt an interest in his reply.</p>
               <p>"No; I have not been courting: only been spending the evening with the gentleman
                  you think so handsome—Lieutenant Hilton!"</p>
               <p>"He <emph>is</emph> handsome; but there is something more than mere
                     <emph>beauty</emph> required to win a true woman's love!" said Lizzie, in a
                  serious tone.</p>
               <p>"You speak as if you were a woman, Lizzie!"</p>
               <p>"I am almost sixteen, Mr. Cramer!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I forget that I am depriving you of your rest. Good night, my sweet
                  friend!" said Ernest, taking a lamp from the hall table and passing up-stairs.</p>
               <p>"Good night, sir," responded the fair girl. "If you <emph>dream</emph> tonight,
                  dream of me, please, and tell me the dream in the morning!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>READER, come with the into an immense hall in the Eastern past of the city, in
                  that particular quarter known as "The Island," where the "Manhattan Boys," as the
                  noble mechanics of that part of New York call themselves, live. The walls of the
                  hall are festooned around with flowers. At the upper end a large American flag is
                  stretched across, over a raised platform, on which a small desk is placed. A chair
                  is behind the desk, but it is as yet unoccupied. But every seat in that vast hall
                  is filled; and by the doors, and in the aisles between the benches, stand masses
                  of human beings. The hall is filled with men and women, the hard-handed, the
                  true-hearted men; the chaste, patriotic women of America.</p>
               <p>There is a murmur near the door. It increases, and in a moment Ernest Cramer,
                  accompanied by Lieutenant Hilton, is seen moving along the aisle toward the
                  platform at the upper end of the room. Across his breast he wears the glorious
                  tri-colored scarf of the Order, around his neck is the starry collar of another
                  Order of Americans to which he belongs; and girdled to his waist is the "SHIELD"
                  which betokens him to be a member of the highest branch yet instituted of the
                  "United American Mechanics." And now his eye brightens, as he glances over that
                  vast multitude, and sees by their regalia, how many of the noble brotherhood are
                  there to greet him. As he passes on, they almost deafen him with applause. Cheer
                  upon cheer rings on the air; the floor shakes with the stamping of more than two
                  thousand feet.</p>
               <p>Another moment, and he is on the platform, trembling and blushing like a young
                  girl rising in school to recite a lesson before visitors. He has seated Hilton,
                  and now advancing to the desk, he lays a roll of paper down before him. It is the
                  address that he has prepared for the occasion—for he dares not yet to trust
                  himself without notes before an assembly, for fear he may break down.</p>
               <p>All is silence. The multitude wait, almost unbreathing, to hear him open. Pale,
                  pale as a corpse, he stands before them; and looking with a timid glance at that
                  forest of eyes, in a deep, tremulous voice he commences to speak; but as he goes
                  on his manner changes, and he gains confidence. These are his words:—</p>
               <p>"Standing upon the shore of Time's unfathomable ocean, holding the magic wand of
                  history in our hand, we bid the dark waves which cover the past, roll back and
                  reveal the traces of the march which they have hidden! Endued with this power, we
                  stand where hoary Time stood more than three hundred years ago. We have a power of
                  vision, which, like the eye of day, extends far and wide—North, East, South and
                  West, grasping leagues and acres, millions on millions, at a glance.</p>
               <p>"Up from the heaving bosom of the blue Atlantic, as some fair virgin gracefully
                  rises from a crystal bath, slowly and full of majesty, comes the fair Aurora,
                  daughter of the morning and herald of the day;—quick and rapidly, like some fond
                  youth in swift pursuit of her he loves, follows the burning Sun, full of fire,
                  casting the red flush of beauty on tree and flower—on river and lake, on land and
                  sea.</p>
               <p>"And, as he lights up the scene, what do we see? A vast continent! It pillows its
                  head upon eternal snows! Its heart is wrapped in everlasting verdure; its feet are
                  bathed in the pulse-warm, per fumed waters of the flowery, glorious South! Nor
                  spire, nor palace-dome, nor pyramid, greets the far-extending view. But mountains
                  which are wreathed forever with the clouds of heaven—tall monuments of the
                  Almighty's power; vallies, teeming with fruits and flowers; lakes and rivers
                  sparkling in the sun, as silver-scaled fish leap from the glad, peaceful waters;
                  forests, where the wild deer and girl-eyed gazelle find covert,—where the
                  king-bird of Freedom builds its lofty nests; plains, shaken by the thundering
                  tread of the mighty mammoth, or quivering beneath droves of fatted buffalo;
                  meadows, as vast and as level as the great lakes of the North,—these all meet
                     our<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6961-00000020"/> eye: then wherefore ask for the
                  puny monuments of man, mere mockeries, as they are, of God's stupendous
                  handiwork?</p>
               <p>"Yes, alone we gaze upon this continent—this land as yet unknown—as yet without a
                  name! But 'tis not unpeopled! No; behold on yonder lake, that light canoe darting
                  across its glittering waters, while sturdy arms dip flashing paddles in the limpid
                  wave. Why hastes it so towards the shore beyond, where, beneath the shadows of a
                  mighty oak, a fire burns clear and bright beside a tent of untanned skins—skins
                  rent from beasts of the wilderness. See a dusky form, beautiful in every limb,
                  graceful, and all womanly, bending over the very verge of the waters. Her tiny
                  feet are kissed by the ripples which roll up playfully among the pebbles on the
                  shore. Her right arm points to the coming bark; her left encircles a laughing
                  image of herself, a babe beautiful as the bud beside the full-blown rose. The
                  swift boat nears the shore—it touches the strand. A manly form, tall and straight
                  as an Apollo, leaps from the bow; then breast to breast and lip to lip—the
                  nature-wedded children of the land have met. They are happy. Temperance is their
                  birth-right; for God has given them naught but the pure crystal of the mountain
                  stream to drink. Honest; for each man is as wealthy as his neighbor: the land, the
                  water, the birds of the air, and the beasts of the forest,—all are equally the
                  property of each and all of them. Industrious: so far as <emph>Nature</emph>
                  teaches; for he wins by his labor food for substance, clothing sufficient for
                  comfort. And what more does man need? Loving, because <emph>Nature</emph> has her
                  sway; no cold form, no freezing etiquette—no barter and sale of the heart's
                  affections, has he, to chill his soul, and shut out the sunlight of feeling from
                  his heart.</p>
               <p>"And from the frozen North, where rainbow-hued peaks of ice point their glittering
                  spires high toward the throne of God, to the luscious South, where balmy Summer
                  sleeps upon a couch of flowers,—far and wide, see a people <emph>all</emph> like
                  this. Honest, affectionate, industrious, temperate, happy. God, in his
                  beneficence, has given them all they need—given to them that which he gave to his
                  first-born of EDEN. No plague with pestilential breath sweeps off their beautiful
                  and brave; no fire-water-<choice>

                     <corr>poison</corr>
                  </choice> sucks up the heart's-blood of the noblest and best; no curse, like envy,
                  avarice, or ambitious tyranny, has yet settled like a bird of evil among them.</p>
               <p>"Their religion is simple: they have no '<hi rend="i"/>saints,' but, taught by
                  Nature, they worship Nature's god, in Nature's language! When they die, they go up
                  to the hunting grounds of the Great Spirit.</p>
               <p>"And yet we <emph>pity</emph> them—pity them, because they are SAVAGES!—They know
                  not how to make <emph>rum</emph> with which to steal man's mind away, and shatter
                  it in its tenement. They know not how to build churches where only <emph>one
                     creed</emph> may come to worship God—where they only are <emph>brothers</emph>,
                  who hold <emph>one</emph> belief! They know not how to build prisons or scaffolds;
                  have never twisted the hangman's rope, or sharpened the headsman's axe! They have
                  not learned to build palaces, and to place mortals there to be worshipped as gods,
                  giving them power of life and death, wealth which <emph>should</emph> be the
                  property of all; crowns, jewelled with human tears,—robes, crimsoned with human
                  blood! They have not learned to rob their brother man of God's first, dearest,
                  holiest gift—Liberty, <emph>blessed</emph> Liberty!</p>
               <p>"They have not learned to make laws which will shield error and wrong, and cause
                     <emph>Right</emph> to suffer; laws which frown on the poor and smile on the
                  rich—nor have they lawyers who feed and live and breathe only on the proceeds, the
                  fruits, the air of <emph>trouble</emph>, animosity and litigation! They do not
                  starve the widow, or rob the orphan, or murder unborn babes!</p>
               <p>"And yet we <emph>pity</emph> them, for they were <emph>savages</emph>, <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> happy people of a vast, beautiful, gloriously beautiful, land!</p>
               <p>"Time's surges roll yet a little higher on the shore. Stepping back from the
                  overwhelming wave, we gaze once more out upon the ocean. Ah! what see we there? A
                  sail? Yes, with snowy canvas bellying to the eastern gale, and gay pennons
                  fluttering like tongues of glad tidings in the air, a ship ploughs through the
                  main. The dusky people of the land gather all wondering on the shore. They see a
                  group of people on the deck of 'the great Canoe,' who shout and dance with joy, as
                  she nears the shore of the unknown land. Clad not in skins, but garments of a
                  finer texture and gayer hues—their skins mingling in color with the lily and the
                  rose, the untaught<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6961-00000021"/> children of the land
                  think that they are Angels of the Great Spirit But see—a cloud of wreathed smoke
                  bursts from the side of the Great Canoe, preceded by a lurid flash of lightning,
                  and followed by a tone of deafening thunder! Then the untaught savages cast
                  themselves upon their faces, murmuring, "THESE ARE GODS—THESE ARE GODS!"</p>
               <p>"But soon—too soon, alas! do they learn that these <emph>gods</emph> are not only
                     <emph>mortals</emph>, but mortals as frail and far more sinful than they. These
                  gods bring the <emph>poisonous</emph> fire-water among them; disease and
                  pestilence soon follow in their wake; they teach them to make the thunder and
                  lightning they have seen and heard, subservient to hands bent on murder, dripping
                  with slaughter! They tell them how to worship God as <emph>Christians</emph> do—if
                  they <emph>will not</emph>, they scourge, they torture, they burn them at the
                  stake. They encourage dissensions, they rob them of their maidens, they debauch
                  their wives, sisters and daughters—they chain their men to slavery and labor; if
                  they resist, they slay them, burn their wigwams, take their lands.</p>
               <p>"But this is no longer an <emph>unknown</emph> land, it is called AMERICA! A
                     <emph>man</emph> who, robed in scarlet, sits on the golden throne in the far
                  East, a mitre on his head, and 'the keys of Heaven's gates' in his hand, raises
                  the cross of Jesus, and says, 'The new-found land is mine, it and all its wealth,
                  its gold and its silver, its fruits and its vines; it and all its people!' And,
                  generous as a <emph>beggar</emph> who gives away <emph>millions</emph>, he tells
                  the King and Queen of Spain, 'I give ye this new land, send thither warriors and
                  priests to subdue and conquer it, and to convert the <emph>wicked</emph> savages,
                  the <emph>horrible</emph> heathen, to our kind and gentle Religion. Take with ye
                  the tortures of the Inquisition, and use them if they will not be
                     <emph>converted</emph>, and give to the Church their gold and their silver;
                  stretch ye them on burning beds of fire—hang, shoot, stab, burn, destroy; do ye
                     <emph>all</emph> this to teach them the <emph>Christian religion!</emph>'</p>
               <p>"And was not <emph>he</emph>, the holy Pope of Rome, obeyed? Shade of Montezuma,
                  answer! Yes; the savages were soon <emph>taught</emph> how God-like was the white
                  man, how pure and how heavenly were his attributes, how, like a meek and holy
                  follower of our Saviour, Jesus, he taught the precepts of Him whose walk on earth
                  was peace and good-will to all men—who died to save <emph>all</emph> mankind!</p>
               <p>"I dare not gaze long on this picture, on the first settlement of America by the
                  whites. No, for groans rend my ears, blood dims my eye-sight; tarried I to gaze,
                  indignation, burning with passionate fire in my breast, would bring a curse to my
                  lips, a curse on those who found a <emph>paradise</emph> to make of it
                     <emph>almost</emph> a <emph>hell!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Roll on, then, thou dark wave of time; hide all this again from our view, and
                  standing farther up on the shore, and nearer to the deep waters of eternity, we
                  will again look over the land. The savages, thinned off by disease, pestilence,
                  and war, cut off by the rum-poison, and slain by those who coveted their lands,
                  have receded like their forests and their game; dried up before the light of
                  civilisation as the dew-flowers of morning perish beneath the fierce blaze of the
                  noonday sun. Back, back with aching hearts and blood-stained tracks, step by step,
                  their faces to the foe and their backs to the sun, have they been forced; back
                  beyond the first range of mountains from the sea.</p>
               <p>"And their places are filled, filled with a hardy, fearless, rude, but
                  industrious, race. As the <emph>first</emph> conquerors return to their masters
                  laden with gold, the injured and oppressed of Europe hear with wondering joy of
                  this new land; the Huguenot, the Puritan, the persecuted call it the Canaan of
                  their hopes, and fly to it for refuge from tyranny. But the tyrants claim the
                  right of sovereignty here. They send their Governors, their tax-collectors, and
                  their soldiers, and <emph>here</emph> they heap burdens on the people heavier than
                  before. They will not endure that even here in the wilderness,
                     <emph>Liberty</emph> shall find an abiding place! Wrong upon wrong they heap
                  upon the people! The people have borne and foreborne, until forbearance has ceased
                  to become a virtue, when not to resist were a crime, a black and damning crime. A
                  Cicero, an <emph>American</emph> Cicero, arises, and cries,—'An appeal to arms and
                  the God of Hosts is all that is left us! Why stand we here idle? Is life so dear,
                  or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid
                  it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take—but as for me, <emph>give
                     me liberty or death!</emph>'</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6961-00000022"/>
               <p>"From shore to shore, on the hill-top, and in the valley, in the city and in the
                  forest, that cry was echoed. A people which, in a few years, had grown into a
                  nation, arose, and, with one accord, cast off their iron manacles of tyranny. Led
                  on to victory by a WASHINGTON, guided by the wisdom of a Hancock, an Adams, a
                  Jefferson, and a Franklin; supported by the patriotism and chivalry of a Gates, a
                  Schuyler, a Marion, a Lee, a Wayne, a Lafayette, and a host like them, they
                  struggled through a long and terrible war, struggled through it all into the
                  sunlight of a glorious triumph. Freedom was theirs, freedom of thought, of speech,
                  of action, and, above all, the light-diffusing freedom of the PRESS! A UNION of
                  nations, of independent, self-governing States was formed. Each golden link was
                  welded by interest, by love, by the brotherhood formed in danger, by that
                  necessity for Union, which gave birth to this thought: 'UNITED WE STAND—DIVIDED WE
                  FALL!'</p>
               <p>"And where is the recreant who would wish to see one link dropped from this
                  glittering chain of strength and glory? Where is the traitor knave who'd lift a
                  sacrilegious hand to break that which God hath united, which man <emph>must</emph>
                  not sever! May its pulses freeze, its nerves wither, and all its joints stiffen in
                  death, while its marrow turns to dust! Where is the false prophet who dares to
                  foretell a disunion of these blood-brightened links? Palsied be his tongue to the
                  very root, ere he can croak out one word of disunion!</p>
               <p>"No; while Washington is remembered there never can be a dissolution of this
                  Republic! None but time-serving demagogues, who'd, Arnold-like, barter their
                  country for place and for gold, would ever aim at such a result, and thank
                  Almighty God—<hi rend="i"/>hemp is a native production, and, if traitors proceed
                  to extremities, the limbs of our native oaks will bear a <emph>new</emph> fruit, a
                  fruit which <emph>men</emph> will despise, <emph>angels</emph> turn away from, and
                     <emph>fiends</emph> from <emph>hell</emph> will claim as their own!</p>
               <p>"Having hurriedly, and all too briefly for the subject, glanced at America as she
                  has been, we will now look at her as she <emph>is</emph>. From the original
                     <emph>thirteen</emph>, we have gained in number until we can count
                     <emph>thirty</emph> States united under one head, yet governed by the wishes,
                  and votes, and opinions of <emph>all!</emph> From a population of between three
                  and four millions at the time of the Revolution, we now number over twenty-three
                  millions. The first railroad ever built in this country, if I remember correctly,
                  was built in 1832 or 4, was a small experimental track of only fourteen or fifteen
                  miles, laid from Carbondale to Honesdale, in the coal regions of Pennsylvania; and
                  now there is nearly or quite <emph>seven thousand</emph> miles of railroad
                     <emph>finished</emph> in the United States, and in constant use. Many, yes,
                  most of my hearers can remember when steamboats were invented, and when Fulton and
                  Fitch were considered mere schemers, men more fitted for the mad-house and
                  straight jacket, than anything else. Yet now we see every lake, sea and river in
                  our land, (except the political stream known as <hi rend="i"/>Salt River,)
                  navigated by our steamers. Every sea in the whole world is whitened with the sails
                  of our commerce. We are wealthy, more prosperous, and less indebted than any other
                  nation in existence. We are at peace with all the world and '<hi rend="i"/>the
                  rest of mankind,' but we are ready for war, and able to cope with any power that
                  chooses to try a hand, and would not be much alarmed if they hitched teams, and
                  came on three, or four, or half-a-dozen at a time. We could, feeling rather
                     <emph>hungryish</emph>, whet our appetite on Austria, take France for a light
                  breakfast, England for an early lunch, and dine on Russia, take China for tea, and
                  use the rest up for a light supper! There's no exact means of finding out what we
                  couldn't do if we <emph>tried</emph>, for with an American to <emph>try</emph>, is
                  ever to <emph>succeed</emph>. Like the veteran soldier, Miller, when asked at
                  Niagara, if he could storm a hill occupied by the enemy, and take a battery which
                  was pouring death and destruction into the ranks of our patriot army, an American
                  looks at an obstacle, says 'I'LL TRY,' charges boldly, and, as Miller was, is
                  VICTORIOUS!</p>
               <p>"We are in possession of every civil and religious liberty which man can wish for!
                  We are enjoying all the blessings of a progressive age! Education is diffusing
                  light over every part of our land. The anvil, the plough, and the loom, are busy
                  everywhere. Industry is flourishing, labor is becoming more and more appreciated,
                  and as the laborer begins to learn and use his <emph>moral</emph> as well as
                     <emph>physical</emph> power, so does he begin to gam more adequate rewards for
                  his labor. The<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6961-00000023"/> employer begins to feel
                  that labor is equal, aye, more than equal to capital, and that '<emph>the laborer
                     is worthy of his hire!</emph>'</p>
               <p>"The working man begins to kick against the spurs with which aristocratic wealth
                  would goad him on in the old accustomed track. The day which will find that all
                  men <emph>are</emph> free and equal, appears to be rapidly approaching, and
                  welcome, <emph>thrice</emph> welcome will it be when it comes!</p>

                  intelligence of this <emph>thinking</emph> and kind audience needs no prompting on
                  this subject; you are all as well aware as I, of the present condition of our
                  dear, our heaven-blessed country. I will spend a few moments in an imaginative
                  glance at the prospective career of America. We will think what she
                     <emph>may</emph> be. And there are two views before us—one bright, glorious and
                  cheering as the sun's pathway when no cloud obscures the sky; the other dark,
                  threatening and clouded, ending in night, the night which enveloped Rome and
                  Greece—the night which is worse than oblivion—the night which darkens over the
                  ruins of nations!</p>

                  seek freedom on their own soil. To say to a Hungary, <emph>Strike</emph>, brother,

               <p>"And we have not only the home-traitor to guard against and fear—but the
                  emissaries of foreign governments who are jealous of our National progress or
                  fearful of our power. With a keen and prophetic eye WASHINGTON scanned the future,
                  and solemn indeed was his warning—spoken in these words: 'AGAINST THE INSIDIOUS
                  WILES OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens,) THE
                  JEALOUSY OF A FREE PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE CONSTANTLY AWAKE; SINCE HISTORY AND
                  EXPERIENCE PROVE THAT FOREIGN INFLUENCE IS ONE OF THE MOST BALEFUL FOES OF
                  REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT.'</p>
               <p>It is against that influence from abroad and here in our midst, fellow citizens,
                  that we must work. We <emph>must</emph> keep the reins of our government in our
                     <emph>own</emph> hands. Had Lawrence, the lamented Lawrence, had the Chesapeake
                  manned with AMERICANS, he never would have had to cry, 'Don't give up the
                  ship!'—no, had she been manned with an <emph>American</emph> crew instead of the
                  motley gang, more than two-thirds foreigners, who possessed neither bravery nor
                  discipline—she would have either gone down with the star-spangled banner nailed to
                  the mast, or have come in Ironsides-fashion, with a conquered foe in tow.</p>
               <p>"I say we must man our Ship of State with <emph>Americans</emph>, with Native born
                  Americans, with the Sons of Sires who fought, bled and died for the establishment
                  of freedom—with those whose feelings, whose family histories, whose hopes and very
                     <emph>existences</emph>, are linked to the Union as the soul is to the body. It
                  is well, and generous and just, to give a home on the farm which our forefathers
                  left us, to the homeless and landless who come from abroad—but I deny their right
                  to take up lodgings inside of the homestead, to assume the management and control
                  of our blood-bought heritage—a heritage which <emph>their</emph> fathers strove
                  with might and main to wrest from <emph>our</emph> fathers! Shall we forget this?
                  shall we, though we permit the sons of the <emph>murderers</emph> who slew the
                  martyrs of our Revolution, to come amongst us, shall we permit those who have been
                  reared under the shadows of tyranny and educated with dogmas of monarchy and
                  aristocracy, to come here and dictate and <emph>govern</emph> us? No—God, and the
                  memory of the past forbid it!</p>
               <p>"We must, fellow Americans, stand on our reserved rights—our<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000024"/> officers, our guards, our sentinels must
                     <emph>all</emph> be American, or else the dark <emph>future</emph> which I
                  pictured will overtake us and destroy us as a nation. We cannot be
                     <emph>too</emph> American—we cannot too closely follow the example and precepts
                  of Washington! It is the duty as well as the privilege of the American to take an
                  active part in forming his government—it is in the power of Americans, forgetting
                  partizan animosities and political creeds, to make America, essentially what
                  Washington modelled her. Will you not, each and all of you, friends and brothers,
                  do <emph>your</emph> part? Each of you possesses a certain degree of power and
                  influence—where would our floods and swelling rivers come from, were not each drop
                  of dew and rain collected and joined together—use that influence wisely and
                  unitedly, and America will yet be the Queen of the earth, the centre
                     <emph>star</emph> of a glorious Constellation of UNIVERSAL LIBERTY!"</p>
               <p>Still and breathless had they hung upon that young man's words till the last
                  moment—till he had uttered the last word. Then as the storm breaks with resounding
                  force from the cloud, shout upon shout arose from their lips. The young orator who
                  commenced so timidly, had warned as he went on till his face flushed up, till he
                  forgot the audience—saw and felt only the subject of which he discoursed. And the
                  hearts and the feelings of his audience went with him.</p>
               <p>For several minutes after Cramer ceased speaking, his warm-hearted audience
                  continued cheering, and again he stood before them blushing and timid, oppressed
                  by their very kindness, for the excitement which had given him boldness as he
                  spoke on the subject nearest and dearest to his heart, had passed away, and again
                  his nature shrunk from the notice which he had gained. And to add to his
                  confusion, a lovely little girl of seven or eight years of age was seen tripping
                  towards the platform, bearing a wreath of tri-colored flowers—the colors red,
                  white and blue. Amid continued cheers she handed him this, which he raised to his
                  lips, but dared not place on his brow. At the same moment the audience struck up
                  that song so dear to American hearts, the "Star Spangled Banner," and as the last
                  note echoed through the room, Ernest moved with his companion toward the door,
                  shaking hands with numerous friends as he went.</p>
               <p>Springing into a carriage, which waited at the door, the two young men were
                  whirled rapidly from the pleasant scene.</p>
               <p>"Ernest, I envy you!" said Hilton, as soon as they were clear of the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Envy me, Harry? What is there in my life for <emph>you</emph> to envy—you, who
                  have no care, no sorrow!"</p>
               <p>"The triumphs, the applause—the heart-homage of the honest and good, as I have
                  seen it rendered to you to-night, Ernest!"</p>
               <p>"It was not <emph>me</emph> that they applauded, Harry. It was the sentiments
                  which I uttered!"</p>
               <p>"But you were the author of those sentiments, and as the author and the utterer,
                  they applauded you!"</p>
               <p>"And do you think it is for this applause that I am laboring?"</p>
               <p>"No, Ernest, no! I give you credit for a higher and less selfish aim. I
                     <emph>know</emph> that it is for your country and your countrymen that you
                  labor, and not for yourself."</p>
               <p>"You but do me justice, Harry. But you have seen one portion of the duties which I
                  have <emph>voluntarily assumed</emph>—now will you go with me to-night and witness
                  another?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, with pleasure, Ernest. I feel interested and would follow you anywhere, even
                  as a disciple in your glorious cause!"</p>
               <p>Cramer smiled, smiled doubtingly, sadly, as he replied, "You had best see all that
                  I have before me, ere you think of being a disciple of mine!"</p>
               <p>The carriage very soon drew up before the boarding house of Cramer, and the two
                  young men alighting, it was discharged.</p>
               <p>"Come in, Harry; I shall have to change my appearance a little before we start for
                  our next port of destination!" said Cramer.</p>
               <p>They entered the house, and proceeded up-stairs to Ernest's room. Here the latter
                  divested himself of his beautiful regalia, and, to the surprise of Hilton,
                  commenced rapidly to disguise himself. First, with a hand which seemed used to the
                  business, he dipped a sponge into a liquid with which in a moment he darkened his
                  fair complex<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6961-00000025"/> ion to a brunette hue. Then
                  with a compound of henna and pomatum he darkened his eye-brows and eye-lashes,
                  until the dark-blue eyes beneath seemed almost black by the deepening shadows over
                  them. Then combing back his luxuriant brown hair, he placed a natural wig of
                  glossy black hair over it, and touching the parchment foundation of a silky pair
                  of moustaches with a gum-arabic solution, he placed it upon his upper lip, where,
                  drying in a moment with the heat of the skin, it adhered firmly, and no one
                  looking at it would have believed the moustache false.</p>
               <p>Then passing into the bed-room, he remained a few minutes, and, when he
                  re-appeared, his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">personelle</foreign> was so altered, that
                  Hilton scarcely knew him. His dress was rich and genteel, but of a foreign cut.
                  His form was partially enveloped in a magnificent Spanish cloak—a cap of black
                  cloth, drooping over his right ear with the weight of a silken tassel pendant from
                  its peaked crown, covered his glossy wig, and fitting firmly on his head and over
                  his brow secured the hair in its place. On the finger of his ungloved right hand a
                  magnificent diamond glittered. A heavy guard-chain of curiously linked gold was
                  worn around his neck, but this was all the jewellery visible on his person.</p>
               <p>"How do you like my disguise?" he asked, smiling at Hilton's surprise.</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter, it is <emph>perfect!</emph> I'd not believe it was you, if I had not
                  been present at this transformation. But where are you going—why do you so
                  disguise yourself?"</p>
               <p>"I am going where my life would not be worth a dime if I was recognised!" replied
                  Cramer—"I am going to a fashionable gambling hell, where a set of
                     <emph>gentlemanly</emph> thieves and desperadoes collect nightly to ruin such
                  unfortunates as may have been lured to their hell; a set of villains whom I have
                  made my desperate enemies, by my repeated exposures of them and their
                  villanies!"</p>
               <p>"But why do you go there? What is your object?"</p>
               <p>"I have two! First, to save a young man who belongs to a bank in a neighboring
                  city, and who has been entrapped by these villains, who have, I fear, robbed him
                  of thousands, which he cannot repay to the bank he has taken it from; next, to see
                  if there are any new victims in their clutches! To combat such evils as these, I
                  must have a knowledge of those who are most prominent in them, and it can be
                  gained with certainty only by personal observation!"</p>
               <p>"But can you get admittance to this place, easily?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have a note of introduction; and, by the way, you must forget that you are
                  with Ernest Cramer for the rest of the evening, and address me as Senor D'Albro—I
                  am introduced as a gentleman of wealth from Cuba. You speak Spanish, do you
                  not?"</p>
               <p>"A little—learned some from the Senoritas in Mexico, aided by a Spanish grammar
                  and dictionary!"</p>
               <p>"Well, speak to me in Spanish My English words will be few and broken. But another
                  thing—do you ever play?"</p>
               <p>"I have played a little. But I am not addicted to gambling: I learned the folly of
                  it while playing cards when a student; for I could never keep a cent about me. I
                  gambled away my pocket money, my watch, and my very clothes! But I stopped long
                  since, and I shall never indulge in the dangerous amusement again!"</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say so, Harry. I was hesitating to take you with me; for I
                  know what alluring temptations are spread before a young man in a gaming room, and
                  I would not for worlds lead you where you would be tempted into a course which
                  will ruin any man in the world."</p>
               <p>"Ought I not to disguise myself?"</p>
               <p>"No; it is not necessary. Though you are known, well known, thanks to your
                  heroism, you are not yet known to the black-legs as a friend or acquaintance of
                  mine; and your appearance there will be hailed with delight. And you will find
                  yourself surrounded by <emph>respectable</emph> people: by judges, lawyers and men
                  who rank high as gentlemen and statesmen! The company will be select. When we are
                  there, I will point out a few whose rank and position should elevate them above
                  the <emph>possibility</emph> of such associations. I will show you a judge who is
                  breaking the <emph>statute</emph> laws of the State, which he has
                     <emph>sworn</emph> to administer and support; I will show you an ex-legislator
                  who helped to <emph>pass</emph> the very law which he is breaking. I will show<pb
                     n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6961-00000026"/> you merchants, aldermen, and, if
                     <emph>he</emph> should happen to be there tonight, as he was when I was last
                  there, I will show you a <emph>bishop</emph> of the Church of Jesus, in disguise,
                  worshipping at the devilish shrine of Mammon!"</p>
               <p>"Ernest, is this <emph>possible?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>true</emph>, Harry Hilton! I never <emph>lie!</emph> I scorn a liar,
                  for <emph>he</emph> is coward who dares not <emph>always</emph> tell the
                  truth!"</p>
               <p>"Well, let us go. I am anxious to see this strange adventure through."</p>
               <p>"I am ready, but first oblige me by taking these little articles of jewellery
                  along, merely in case we <emph>might</emph> need them!" said Cramer, opening a
                  drawer in his writing-table, and handing Hilton a small pair of single-barreled
                  rifle pistols, gold mounted, and of exquisite workmanship. As he did this, he also
                  took out an ancient-looking "colt revolver," which he examined, and then deposited
                  in a side pocket, mentioning that it was an "old friend which had proved true in
                  former times."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>THE deep tone of the Trinity Church clock had just struck twelve, as Ernest
                  Cramer, disguised and to be known for the evening as Senor D'Albro, accompanied by
                  Lieut. Hilton, turned into Broadway, and passing along it a few hundred paces,
                  paused before a large four-story building which stood directly in front of the
                  City Hall.</p>
               <p>"Is this the place?" asked Hilton in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is it," replied Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," asks the unsophisticated reader, "that a gambling hell can exist
                  in your finest street, fronting the very halls of Justice?"</p>
               <p>Is it <emph>possible?</emph> Yes; and within sight of those very halls where
                  crooked law and prostituted justice is administered oftener far than
                     <emph>Justice</emph> in her purity is felt, there are not one, or two, or
                  three, but <emph>twenty</emph>, openly notorious gambling hells! Hells kept open
                  day and night, yawning wide for victims all the time. Do you doubt me? Go ask the
                  Chief of Police, the Mayor, the District Attorney, and they dare not say these
                  things are not so! How often has the writer of this tale given names and numbers,
                  and exposed these dens—how often has he pleaded with those who could do it if they
                  dared, to break them up, and by so doing is it that he has gained enemies who
                  gloat over his incarceration, and who, wine-bibbers and wine-lovers as they are,
                  would rather drink the warm life-blood spouting from his heart, than to sip the
                  choicest Falernian that ever was pressed from the grape. But avast from comments!
                  To the story.</p>
               <p>Cramer rung with three quick, sharp pulls at the bell-knob of the door before
                  them. In an instant it was opened, and the two, entering, found themselves in a
                  small ante-room, or hall, where a tall, fine-looking negro, dressed in a suit of
                  livery, awaited their orders.</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6961-00000027"/>
               <p>"Dis is ze casa of Senor Manton, eh?" asked Cramer, speaking in a foreign
                  accent.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Manton lives here: your cards if you please, gentlemen!" said the negro,
                  speaking in a tone as smooth and measured as if he was addressing an audience of
                  refined hearers.</p>
               <p>"Take zis lettare to Senor Manton, for me," said Cramer,—D'Albro, I mean—handing a
                  note to the servant with a five-dollar gold piece on top of it. The negro
                  exhibited two very white picket fences of ivory back of his thick lips as he gazed
                  for an instant at the glittering gift, and then, after bowing nearly to the
                  carpet, hurried up-stairs with the note.</p>
               <p>"They do up things in style, here!" whispered Hilton: "servants in livery,
                  &amp;c.!"</p>
               <p>"Wait till you get up-stairs; you'll open your eyes then!" said D'Albro, with a
                  smile.</p>
               <p>At the same moment steps were heard at the head of the stairs, and in an instant
                  the negro was seen descending, followed by a tall, slender, very gentlemanly
                  looking, middle-aged man, who, as his eye fell on the party, quickened his steps,
                  and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Senor D'Albro, I am delighted to see you at my poor quarters. The note of
                  introduction from my statesmanic friend, 'the God-like D.,' as his friends call
                  him, is to you a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> to my house—to
                  you and your friends. You are at home here; welcome to everything—to everything
                  (here he smiled most wickedly) but my mistress!"</p>
               <p>"Very much I thank you, Senor! If you please, I shall make you know my friend,
                  Lieutenant Hilton!" said Cramer, in his foreign accent.</p>
               <p>"What! Lieutenant Harry Hilton, who fought at Cerro Gordo, El Punta Nacionale, and
                  was wounded at Cherubusco?" exclaimed Mr. Manton.</p>
               <p>"The same; at your service!" said Hilton.</p>
               <p>"Jupiter, Mars and Venus! Sir, you are <emph>very</emph> welcome!" cried the
                  proprietor of the establishment. "You and your friend are <emph>very</emph>
                  welcome! Walk up-stairs."</p>
               <p>Without hesitation the two young men followed him, and in a moment they were
                  standing in the second story of the building. It was a large, finely-furnished
                  front parlor, where they stood; but not a sign appeared to them that they were in
                  a gaming hell. The wall was hung with handsome paintings, mostly landscapes and
                  historical pieces,—fine old paintings which had come into the hands of Cornelius
                  Manton at one time and another for but a tithe of their real value. A sideboard
                  stocked with a glittering display of decanters and bottles stood on one side: in
                  the centre a rosewood table, without a cloth, was covered with periodicals,
                  papers, and recent publications. The floor was covered with a costly Brussels
                  carpet, and the furniture was at once neat, exquisitely neat, but costly and
                  rich.</p>
               <p>No persons were in this room when they entered, except a very smart looking,
                  bright mulatto boy, of about twenty years of age, who was not dressed in livery,
                  but exhibited a very good figure clad in a fashionable suit of black. He had been
                  sitting down, but arose as they entered, and stood in a respectful attitude near
                  the sideboard.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, what is your favorite beverage?" asked Manton. "We must moisten our
                  new acquaintance in the generous and heartwarming <foreign xml:lang="FRA">eau de
                     vie</foreign>. What do you prefer, Senor,—wine or something stronger? And what
                  is your favorite, Lieutenant? I have brandy older than either of us, Champagne of
                  the 'Cordon Bleu,' wines of the Rhine, Moselle, and even a flask or two of that
                  choice and rare article, Lachrymae Christa!"</p>
               <p>"Drink of the same you see him drink, and sparingly at that!" said Ernest to his
                  companion, quickly, in Spanish. "He will not drink <emph>drugged</emph> liquor,
                  but we might!"</p>
               <p>"We will join you in your favorite drink; I have heard of your good taste!" said
                  Hilton, bowing to the gentlemanly gambler.</p>
               <p>"I always drink brandy at so early an hour as this!" said Manton. "Fred, break the
                  seal of a bottle of 'Rachau's 1791.'"</p>
               <p>The well-dressed, good-looking servant obeyed, and while Ernest and Hilton
                  examined the paintings, uncorked the bottle, which, with three glasses and a water
                  pitcher, he brought to them on a silver salver.</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6961-00000028"/>
               <p>"You will not have to dilute this!" said Manton. "I drink it pure: it is as mild
                  as oil!"</p>
               <p>"And yet strong as fire!" said Hilton, with a smile. "I know what old liquor is;
                  it is like the pale, meek-looking steel of Damascus—very deceiving!"</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the pressing invitation of Manton, Hilton drank very lightly, and
                  his companion barely touched his glass to his lips.</p>
               <p>Manton, with a look of restrained impatience remarked:</p>
               <p>"You do not seem to like this liquor, gentlemen? It is said to be fine
                  flavored."</p>
               <p>"It is much good, Senor Manton; but so early in de night never do I drink much! I
                  drink more, soon, replied Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Well, suit yourselves, gentlemen. As you Spaniards say, Senor D'Albro, my house
                  is at your service. By the way, will you walk above? Supper will be ready in the
                  back room at one; in the meantime, visit my upper rooms!"</p>
               <p>The two young men bowed an assent, and followed Manton up to the third story,
                  where a blaze of light from a large chandelier revealed to them a brilliant and a
                  singular scene. The first room which they entered was large; its ceiling was hung
                  with a series of voluptuous French prints, and it also had its sideboard loaded
                  with wines and liquors. A roulette wheel was placed at one end of it, and as they
                  entered it was being turned by a little, curly-haired, dark-complexioned man,
                  whose rougish black eye twinkled as the banker by his side raked in the winnings
                  at every turn. Around this stealing machine was quite a large party of
                  well-dressed, genteel-looking men, who were so absorbed in the game that they did
                  not appear to notice the new comers.</p>
               <p>"He whom I seek is not there!" said Cramer to Hilton, in Spanish: "we will pass
                  on!"</p>
               <p>In the centre of the room were several small tables, upon which cards and dice
                  both lay read for use; but the main attraction was at the Faro table at the upper
                  end of the room. Before this about a dozen gentlemen were seated, and in deep
                  silence the absorbing, infatuating game was going on. Hundreds of dollars, at
                  times thousands sands, lay on the table, awaiting a single turn of a card. At
                  times a sigh, again a low muttered curse would be heard from the lips of the
                  losers; but those who gained said nothing, but madly doubled their stakes,
                  tempting Miss Fortune, the coquette, rather than Fortune, the dame.</p>
               <p>Cramer glanced over those who were there assembled, anxiously; but he whom he
                  sought was not there. They stood and watched the game a few moments.</p>
               <p>"Do you not play, Senor?" asked Manton.</p>
               <p>"Not wiz your American games: I not know zem! I look, I see, by and bye I
                  learn."</p>
               <p>"We can manage to get up a game of Monte, if you wish. That is a national game of
                  yours!" continued the gambler. "Walk in the back room; our company is more select
                  there, and less in number!"</p>
               <p>They passed into a smaller room, back, where another faro table was placed, and
                  before this about a dozen respectable-looking, elderly gentlemen were seated. As
                  the two young men entered, a quick glance was exchanged between Manton and his two
                  employees, behind the table; a look which told them as plain as words—"I'm
                  tickling a couple of fine trout; fling out the bait!"</p>
               <p>They approached the table. The cards were dealt from a silver box, by a tall,
                  fine-looking man, whose dress, without being gaudy, was rich and genteel. And as
                  he is partner of Mr. Manton's, we will give you his portrait. Fred. Herbert is a
                  trifle over six feet high; full chested, well formed. His features are regular,
                  complexion florid, and he has but one peculiarity. His small grey eyes are the
                  sharpest and brightest that ever you gazed upon: they seem to pierce right through
                  you—to read your thoughts, and examine the depth of your purse at a glance.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to see you, Manton!" said Mr. Herbert: "the bank is in bad luck: will
                  you take the deal for a turn or two, and see if Fortune will treat you as she does
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"I have two friends here, Fred., to whom I am showing our establishment—Senor
                  D'Albro and Lieut. Hilton."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6961-00000029"/>
               <p>The gambler bowed low and replied—"Perhaps they will enter the game?"</p>
               <p>"They had better not till after supper. It will soon be ready."</p>
               <p>"<emph>He</emph> is not here; he must be above!" said Cramer in a whisper to
                  Hilton. "We must get up there!"</p>
               <p>"What does your friend remark?" asked Manton of Hilton, not understanding
                  Spanish.</p>
               <p>"He is struck with the splendor of your establishment, and the variety and extent
                  of your means of amusement. He says that he has never seen anything like it in his
                  country!"</p>
               <p>A smile flitted over the face of Manton. "He has not seen <emph>my</emph>
                  'sanctum' yet!" he said. "I have yet another room to show him; but it is one to
                  which none but my most valued friends, and best patrons are ever admitted. Few
                  ever pass above this floor; but come, we will go up there. I hope he will be
                  better pleased still!"</p>
               <p>Again they ascend the stairs in the next and last story. Here a servant, dressed
                  in livery, waited at the door, which, it appeared, was locked; for he took a key
                  from his vest, as his master approached, and unlocked it. They then stood in a
                  small ante-room, which was unfurnished, and dimly lighted with a single jet of
                  bluish gas. The floor was not even carpeted; the wall was merely whitewashed; all
                  was cold and gloomy in appearance. A door was visible on the right, but it was
                  closed. Yet the sound of voices, and the tinkle of glasses, was heard beyond it,
                  signifying that there were some who had passed through that chilly ante-room.</p>
               <p>Manton advanced to the door and gave five rapid taps in succession with the heavy
                  seal ring which he wore on his right hand. As he did this, the door flew open, and
                  never had either Hilton or Cramer gazed upon a scene more dazzling. The room was
                  not large, but it was <hi rend="i"/>ceiled with mirrors which extended from the
                  floor to the top of the room. The furniture was all of rose-wood, inlaid with a <choice>
                     <sic>mosiac</sic>
                     <corr>mosaic</corr>
                  </choice> work of pearl and ivory. The floor was carpeted with a gorgeous web of
                  silk; a most singular chandelier, or candelabra, reflecting from the mirrors, made
                  the room dazzlingly light. It was formed by a twining serpent, plated with gold,
                  which seemed to be stretching ing its open mouth down from a spiral coil in the
                  centre of the ceiling overhead, which was painted in fresco style, to represent a
                  forest. From the eyes and open mouth of the serpent three streams of gas gushed
                  out, and with their blaze entirely illuminated the apartment.</p>
               <p>But the eye of Ernest Cramer did not glance at the beauties of the room—it fixed
                  itself in an instant on the flushed face of a young man who stood at the
                  sideboard, and filling a tumbler half full of fiery liquor, drank it off at a
                  draught.</p>
               <p>"He is there, Harry, he is there!" muttered Cramer.</p>
               <p>But Hilton did not hear him. He was so struck with astonishment, that he stood by
                  the door, speechless.</p>
               <p>"Senor D'Albro and Lieutenant Hilton, gentlemen! Honorable gentlemen and trusty
                  friends!" said Manton, as the company glanced around toward them.</p>
               <p>"Most wilcome!" exclaimed a little, dapper, middle-aged gentleman, whose accent
                  was tinctured with the unmistakeable but rich brogue of Erin, the gem of the sea.
                  "Peter, git sates for the gintlemen!"</p>
               <p>The servant to whom he spoke hurried forward to obey, but both Hilton and Cramer
                  declined, expressing a wish to see the game which here was progressing at a faro
                  table of such magnificence as to require a description at our hands. It was like
                  the rest of the furniture, made of rose-wood, inlaid with pearl—and the cloth,
                  whereon the betting cards were spread, was of crimson satin, fringed with gold.
                  The dealer dealt his cards from a box of pure gold, and the checks which were used
                  by the players were mother-of-pearl, and the least one was marked ten dollars,
                  while others, still, were marked $50, $100, $500, $1000.</p>
               <p>The game played here was evidently a high one.</p>
               <p>But the reader is now requested to glance at the man upon whom Cramer's eyes have
                  been fixed ever since he entered the room. He is young, he cannot be thirty yet.
                  His dress is fashionable and tasty, his manner, apart from a present nervousness,
                  haughty and aristocratic.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Mr. Hagerman!" said Manton, approaching him<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000030"/> as he returned from the sideboard to the table to
                  resume his game "How is it, to-night? Are you likely to break the bank to-night as
                  you did the other evening?"</p>
               <p>"No—curse it, no! I am behind over fourteen thousand—if the cards don't turn I
                  will have to quit, for I'm nearly drained!" replied the young man, at the same
                  time reaching over a $500 check, and laying it on a card!</p>
               <p>"Is this your pledge to Mary?" whispered a deep voice in his ear.</p>
               <p>Turning round as quick as thought, and pale as a snow-drop in the face, he
                  cried—"Who spoke to me?"</p>
               <p>"No one spoke. Your card loses!" said Manton, who stood near.</p>
               <p>Hagerman looked from face to face of those around him; all seemed absorbed in the
                  game, and no one seemed to look at it with more eager interest than Senor D'Albro,
                  who stood nearest to him.</p>
               <p>Again he placed a check on the same card—this time it was for $1000. And as he did
                  so, again that deep whisper was in his ear, a whisper which none but he seemed to
                  hear—"Henry Hagerman, <emph>beware!</emph> you are breaking your pledge to
                  Mary!"</p>
               <p>Trembling in every limb he turned again, and was about to speak.</p>
               <p>"Your card wins, Hagerman!" cried Manton.</p>
               <p>"Let it lay, it will win again!" said he in a tone so fierce and singular that
                  those nearest to him even looked up from their game.</p>
               <p>"If you thing so, why don't you increase the stake?" said Manton in a bantering
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"I will—there are five one thousand dollar checks!" replied the young man with a
                  forced calmness.</p>
               <p>"That money was <emph>stolen!</emph>" came upon his ear in the same deep, low
                  whisper.</p>
               <p>"Did you speak to me, sir?" thundered the young man, red as fire from anger, and
                  trembling in every limb, turning short around upon D'Albro, who seemed intent upon
                  overlooking the game.</p>
               <p>"Que dice? you speak, Senor, to me?" said he, looking up with a glance of innocent
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"No one spoke, Mr. Hagerman; watch your game now, you may lose that little pile!"
                  cried Manton.</p>
               <p>"No, by Jupiter it wins!" cried the young man as the card turned up.</p>
               <p>"It is a pity you hadn't bet all your pile, isn't it!" said the gambler coolly, as
                  the banker paid over the checks. "You'd better pocket that now and not try your
                  luck again on a single card!"</p>
               <p>"That card will win once more, and I'll lay every dollar of my winnings, every
                  dollar I have with me!" cried the young man, infatuated with his temporary change
                  of luck.</p>
               <p>"Do not—you'll lose!" was again heard in that whisper.</p>
               <p>"Mind your own business, whoever you are!" muttered the young man as he drew out a
                  pocket-book and emptied it of its contents, laying the whole on the same card.</p>
               <p>"My business is to save you—forbear! For Mary's sake, <emph>forbear!</emph>" again
                  was uttered in the warning voice.</p>
               <p>The young man did not reply, he watched the jewelled hand of the dealer as he
                  again took hold of the box and drew the card which was to determine who should
                  possess the sum of thirty thousand dollars which lay staked on a single card. And,
                  as if he would play with, and torture, his victim, like an experienced angler with
                  a trout on his line, which he delays to kill, the dealer looked at Hagerman's
                  pallid face, quivering lip, and straining eye, and with a very slow movement drew
                  off the card which concealed that below which was to decide the matter. As the
                  latter was seen, the young man bent forward to look, then gasping out, "My God—I
                  am ruined!" he fell backward, and, had he not been caught by the extended arms of
                  Cramer, would have been stretched senseless on the floor.</p>
               <p>"Do not trouble yourself, Senor!" said Manton, quietly. "Here, Peter, take Mr.
                  Hagerman into the inner room, and bathe his head with cold water. He'll come too
                  in a few minutes. He made too heavy a risk. He was foolish to lay so much money
                  for the third time on one card!"</p>
               <p>Oh, how much Ernest Cramer yearned to tell that vile gambler what his heart, his
                  indignant heart, felt at that moment. He had detected the signs passing between
                  the dealer and Manton; he knew that the money had been won by trickery, and he
                  knew that the<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6961-00000031"/> wretched loser had been
                  duped and led on from step to step till he was on the verge of disgrace and ruin;
                  for he had been playing then and there with money which he had taken from the
                  vaults of the bank of which he was an officer.</p>
               <p>As the unfortunate young man was borne from the room, Manton drew a splendid watch
                  from his pocket, and, noting the hour, said to the company—"It is our supper time,
                  gentlemen: suppose you adjourn for a half hour—the game will be all the pleasanter
                  after you have taken a bite, and tasted a glass or two of generous wine!"</p>
               <p>"Who is that tall, pale, severe looking man?" asked Hilton, as he glanced at a man
                  who had played deeply, but silently, and very heavily, who arose with the
                  rest.</p>
               <p>"A man who professes to be a Minister of God—a Jesuit, whom I suspect to be the
                  head of the secret order of which I spoke to you last night!"</p>
               <p>"And who is that red-faced, jolly-looking gentleman with a white neckcloth. He is
                  not a Minister also?"</p>
               <p>"No; he is <emph>only</emph> a Judge."</p>
               <p>"And he dares to come here?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly: the company is very <emph>select</emph>, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"My God! let us go!" said Hilton, nervously.</p>
               <p>"Not till after supper. A hasty retreat might create suspicion; besides, I
                     <emph>must</emph> see poor Hagerman safe out of this hell to-night. I promised
                  his wife to do so, and to try to save him."</p>
               <p>"His wife? Do you know her?"</p>
               <p>"She spent an hour with me this afternoon, explaining his situation, and her fears
                  concerning him; and her last words were, as she went off weeping—'If you can only
                  save him, sir, from ruin, I will pray to God to bless you—pray to my dying hour
                  for you!' She is a pure, noble, devoted woman, and I want the prayers of such as
                  her. I have faith in them."</p>
               <p>"Come, gentlemen,—come to supper!" said Manton, approaching them. He had been
                  holding a brief conversation with His Honor the Judge,—perhaps talking over the
                  last trial.</p>
               <p>The party left the room; but the dealer and his banker companion remained to count
                  their winnings. * * * * * *</p>
               <p>It was only an hour later. Escorted to the very door, by the bowing Manton, came
                  Senor D'Albro and Hilton.</p>
               <p>"You will come again, gentlemen, I hope!" cried the gambler. "Senor, when next you
                  visit me, I will get up a nice little game of Monte, expressly for your
                  amusement!"</p>
               <p>After the door closed, they passed a little way down the street, and then paused
                  in the shade of an awning, which projected from a jeweller's store over the
                  pavement.</p>
               <p>"We will wait here a moment: there is his carriage at the corner, with the driver
                  asleep on the box. I wish to see him started for home; for he will go elsewhere,
                  if I don't use my influence. He never goes home when he stays out to play, his
                  wife informs me; but passes his <emph>mornings</emph> in a den of pollution, or
                  rather a palace of infamy, which is considered such 'a <emph>necessary</emph>
                  evil' by our city authorities, that it is permitted to exist, <emph>openly</emph>
                  and <emph>notoriously</emph>, next door to a <emph>Police Station House!</emph>
                  though a nuisance to the city, a most dangerous snare to strangers, and a
                  positively <emph>unlawful</emph> establishment!" said Cramer. "And for fear that I
                  might be recognised, you'll oblige me by taking this cloak—change caps with me.
                  Hold this wig!"</p>
               <p>It was but the work of an instant for Cramer to take off his wig and moustache,
                  then with his cloak and cap changed, and his coat buttoned up so as to conceal his
                  jewellery, he was entirely altered from the appearance of <emph>the</emph> Senor
                  D'Albro, who had honored Mr. Manton with a visit. He had scarcely done this, and
                  bade Hilton stand closer in the shade, so as not to be seen, when a man was seen
                  to stagger out of the same door through which they had so lately passed. It was
                  Hagerman. He reeled past, and with a curse awoke his sleeping driver.</p>
               <p>"Take me to Leonard street!" he cried, hoarsely.</p>
               <p>"Hold! your road is not in that direction. Your house is across the East River!"
                  cried Cramer, stepping to the side of the carriage which the young man was
                  entering.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6961-00000032"/>
               <p>"Who are you that dares to interfere with my orders, or be a spy upon my actions?"
                  cried the young man, thrusting his hand into his bosom as if to draw a weapon.</p>
               <p>"A friend to your injured wife; one who knows how much money you have lost
                  to-night, and where it came from!"</p>
               <p>"My God!" gasped the wretched man, "am I known—exposure and disgrace will follow!"
                  and he sank almost senseless on the seat of his carriage.</p>
               <p>"Henry Hagerman," said Cramer, earnestly—"go home now—go home, and do nothing
                  rashly; you may yet be saved! Go home, and to-morrow evening I will call on you as
                  a friend to try and aid you!"</p>
               <p>"Who are you—tell me who you are?"</p>
               <p>"A friend to Mary! Go home to her, and tell her I sent you!" Then speaking to the
                  driver, Cramer added—"Mr. Hagerman wishes to go <emph>home</emph>, driver! Home,
                  do you understand?"</p>
               <p>"Yis, sir, be me faith I do, and its glad I am, for I'm as slapy as a baby afther
                  dinner!" said the driver, who had not been able to hear what Cramer had spoken to
                  his master, for his tone was low.</p>
               <p>After the carriage drove off, Ernest rejoined his companion.</p>
               <p>"Shall we go home now?" asked Hilton.</p>
               <p>"As you please," said Cramer, "but if you can spare an hour longer, I would like
                  to show you a scene to contrast with the picture of wealth and crime which we have
                  just been gazing at. My visits are not confined to the wealthy, altogether!"</p>
               <p>"At your service—we may as well make a night of it!"</p>
               <p>The two young men crossed Broadway, and passed through the Park into Centre
                  street; and in less than three minutes after they left the <hi rend="i"/>locale of
                  wealth and aristocracy, they paused in a narrow street which opened eastward from
                  Centre, before a wooden building, which looked old, rotten, and miserable, too
                  much so to be inhabited with <emph>safety</emph>, not to think of
                     <emph>comfort</emph>. The street was deserted—no, not quite, for a couple of
                  large lank hogs were promenading in quiet dignity through the thick and slimy mud,
                  enjoying the evening, the only time, thanks to our "vigilant police," and the
                  hog-catchers, that these gentry can enjoy a <emph>quiet</emph> promenade.</p>
               <p>The house before which they paused was dark; its windows had been boarded up,
                  because boards in the long run are cheaper than glass, for they don't break so
                  easy, nor require constant repairing There was no sound to be heard from it, and,
                  as from Ernest's look and motion when he paused, Hilton thought he was about to
                  enter, he asked:</p>
               <p>"Is this the place? Surely, this old shell isn't inhabited!"</p>
               <p>"It is, and by not less than three hundred persons!"</p>
               <p>"Ernest, what's the use of telling me that! <emph>Three hundred</emph> people?
                  Why, that number couldn't find room to stand up under that roof!"</p>
               <p>Cramer smiled as he replied: "You will see, directly. We must get a light!"</p>
               <p>Passing on and turning a corner, they were in a small square—or rather an opening
                  in an irregular triangle, which Hilton at once recognised, for he said:</p>
               <p>"We're in the Points, Ernest! What the deuce do you want here?"</p>
               <p>"I'm going to Pat Mullins' grocery for a candle and some matches!" replied the
                  young author. "We shall need them in the visit we are about to make!"</p>
               <p>"But, groceries are not open at this hour!"</p>
               <p>"They are never closed except in the daytime in this region!" said Cramer. "Here
                  the night is literally turned into day. The sound of music, of dancing, of oaths
                  and shrieks, of laughter and of anger, may be heard all the night long; but when
                  the day dawns, and the light of the sun comes down upon the reeking filth and
                  rotten garbage, then the revellers, the thieves, and those who have been 'up and
                  doing' their deeds of darkness, in darkness, slink away to the inner recesses of
                  their dens, and all is quiet until darkness again mantles the scene! Every
                     <emph>day</emph> is still as Sabbath here, for trade is full, and few people
                  pass through these filthy lanes and alleys!"</p>
               <p>And to verify the words of Cramer, Hilton had only to look around him. Lights were
                  seen all around them—the sound of fiddles and tamborines, the shuffling feet of
                  dancers, the curses and the shouts of<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6961-00000033"/>
                  men; the shrieks and the laughter of women; all kinds of noises, all manner of
                  sights, all sorts of smells, and such as you can see, and hear, and smell, in the
                  "Points" only.</p>
               <p>Hurrying along the western side of this square, they reached a corner, where they
                  turned into a grocery, which was filled with negroes and dirty-looking whites,
                  most of whom were patronising the "bar," purchasing gin at two cents a glass. This
                  seemed to be the article in which the grocer dealt most largely, for a few huge
                  barrels of a rummy look, a flitch or two of exceedingly slender bacon, a few
                  strings of onions, and some Dutch looking bread on a back shelf, were all the
                  stock visible to the eye.</p>
               <p>As Ernest and his friend entered, the eye of the gentlemen behind the bar glanced
                  quickly upon them, and he seemed to recognise Cramer, for his very red face opened
                  in half, as he grinned a recognitory smile, at the same time displaying a row of
                  grinders which would have done excellent service as a rag-picking-machine in a
                  paper-mill. Mr. Mullins wasn't a very handsome man, not even for a Greek. He was
                  about five feet high, and fully as broad as he was long. He might have been forty
                  or fifty years of age, he might have been older; it would be hard to tell how old,
                  for, as the reader knows, when anything is "preserved in spirits," after it is
                  once thoroughly soaked, it just about holds its own, and don't change for years,
                  and so it <emph>was</emph> and <emph>is,</emph> with Pat Mullins.</p>
               <p>When Pat saw our two friends enter, he set down a decanter which he held in his
                  hand, and waving his customers back, cried:</p>
               <p>"Stan' out o' the way there, gintlemen nagers, don't yez see the nobs aforeninst
                  yez?"</p>
               <p>Then, smiling again, with a smile which produced an absolute divorce between the
                  northern and southern continents of his head, he said, addressing our friends:</p>
               <p>"Glad to see yez, gintlemen! It's not often the likes o' yez does Pathrick Mullins
                  the honor o' patronising his establishment, though a dacenter grocery isn't to be
                  found in the neighborhood! Will yez taste a drop o' somethin' extra this avenin'!
                  I've Mountain-dew, and four dhollar Brandy, and Jamaica. What wud ye like,
                  gintlemen?"</p>
               <p>"A couple of candles and a box of matches, if you please, Mr Mullins!" said
                  Cramer.</p>
               <p>A look of disappointment, denoted principally by an immediate union of both parts
                  of his face, showed that Mr. Mullins's hopes of disposing of twelve and a half
                  cents' worth of bad liquor were lost; but when Cramer threw a half dollar down,
                  and said—"Be quick, Pat, <emph>never mind the change!</emph>" the smile
                  reappeared, and he hurried to get the candles.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, the two young men had again re-entered the narrow street, where
                  the wooden building before alluded to, stood, or was propped up, and, entering a
                  narrow, filthy alley, at one side of it, Cramer paused to light a candle. It was
                  necessary to do this, for it was dark as Erebus, and they could not but dread
                  tumbling into some noisome pit, or yawning cellar. The air was close and noisome
                  as the atmosphere of a cemetery receiving-vault, or a Potter's field. They picked
                  their way along until they reached the entrance of the building, about mid-way of
                  its length, where a door had been, but it was now off the hinges. As they entered,
                  a flight of dangerous looking stairs were seen in front of them, and a door opened
                  on the right and left, on the first floor.</p>
               <p>"We will go up-stairs, first!" said Cramer; "we will look into the lower rooms as
                  we come down!"</p>
               <p>The stairs trembled and creaked as they went up, and Hilton, who was not used to
                  such passages as Cramer was, stepped hastily and nervously, dreading each moment
                  that the frail structure would come down under their weight. A few steps brought
                  them to a second landing, and here also doors opened to the right and the left,
                  but a turn of the staircase shewed that there was yet another loft in the
                  building.</p>
               <p>"One flight higher, and then I'll show you a picture!" said Ernest.</p>
               <p>Upon reaching the head of the last flight of stairs, Cramer turned without
                  hesitation to the right; and pushed open the door with his foot, for it had
                  neither bar or latch.</p>
               <p>"Hilton, come in!' he said—"don't be alarmed—there is no necessity of using any
                     <emph>ceremony</emph> here."'</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6961-00000034"/>
               <p>"I should think not by the way you act!" said the soldier, as he followed within
                  the door.</p>
               <p>But he did not speak when he entered. The air was hot and stifling, steaming with
                  the breath of over thirty human beings, all crowded into a room not more than
                  twelve feet square, in which neither fire, light, nor a single article of
                  furniture could be seen. Beds had they none, save a few bunches of shavings, which
                  had been torn from the bon-fire-making 'prentices of some carpenter. A blanket,
                  ragged and dirty, could be seen here and there, wrapping a wretched mother and
                  three or four children, which, like hovering chickens, crept close to her to keep
                  from freezing; then there were others, who lay upon the bare and dirty floor, with
                  no covering save their tattered clothing—no pillow, no bedding, almost naked.
                  There were but three or four men in the room, and these were helpless from age, of
                  cripples. The greater part of the occupants were children, of the class which on a
                  rainy day infests our street crossings, and a few women, who, in the early morning
                  and dusky evening, are seen flitting from house to house, stopping at each area at
                  the kitchen door, to ask for cold victuals. When the glare of the light fell
                  sicklily athwart their gaunt bodies and haggard faces, some of them half arose,
                  and looked up with fearful eyes towards the intruders—then sunk down again
                  sleepily beside those who snored on in happy forgetfulness of life's miseries, but
                  one or two yankee-like, ever "awake for trade," rose, and stretching out their
                  thin bony fingers, said—"Penny, 'f'u please, sir!"</p>
               <p>Hilton's hand was on his pocket-book, which would have been emptied amongst them
                  in a moment, had not Cramer prevented it.</p>
               <p>"It would be <emph>waste,</emph>" said he, "to give them much. A few sixpences
                  properly bestowed, would be of more use to them, and quite as thankfully received,
                  as a shower of bank bills. See, I come prepared always, when I visit such
                  places!"</p>
               <p>As he said this, Cramer drew a handful of pennies and six-penny-bits from his
                  pocket, and scattered it upon the floor, and amid the din of the scramble which
                  followed, he withdrew.</p>
               <p>"Heavens!" cried Hilton, as they again stood upon the stars, "is this real?"</p>
               <p>Before Cramer could reply, a shrill scream was heard from the room opposite to
                  that which they had entered—a shrill and fearful cry repeated rapidly, in a tone
                  which thrilled through their very hearts—"<emph>Murder! Murder!</emph>
                  MURDER!"</p>
               <p>With a bound which extinguished his light, Cramer sprang to the door, close
                  followed by Hilton, and, as they dashed it open, they could hear the struggling of
                  excited combatants—the curses of a man, the choked gaspings of a woman, and then,
                  to add to the horror of the scene, the cries of terrified or hurt children were
                  heard.</p>
               <p>Hilton rushed blindly into the room, but Cramer drew a match from his pocket, and
                  relighted his candle, so that he might see where he might be useful, and what was
                  going on. When by it, he was enabled to see what was the matter, he beheld Hilton
                  stretched at full length amongst a crowd of beggar children, who were thick and
                  sprawling, and squalling; while just beyond his reach, were the real combatants in
                  the fracas, a nearly naked man, and a woman quite as bad off in the dry goods
                  line, who were clinched, and struggling as if for life or death. An empty
                  gin-bottle near them accounted for their anger "in a <emph>measure,</emph>" and,
                  as Cramer stepped over the others and loosened the male brute's hand from the
                  female's throat, he asked what the matter was.</p>
               <p>"Sure, an' by Saint Dennis O' Sligo," cried the man, "didn't I wake and find the
                  bottle that I left full, when I went to slape, wid nothin' in it at all—at all?
                  The crater drinked it all, and I mane for to bate her for pay!"</p>
               <p>"But you musn't strike a woman!" cried Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Isn't this a fray counthry?" replied the man. "Can't a man ate his own wife
                  widout paple a throublin' of him?"</p>
               <p>"No—not while an American is present—it's against our national rules!"</p>
               <p>"To the divil wid such a fray counthry, thin!"</p>
               <p>"What did you come here for?" asked Hilton, not very good-naturedly<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000035"/> naturedly, as he arose from the unclean embraces of
                  his juvenile friends.</p>
               <p>"Becase the parish sent me, an' the woman, an' the childers. What else could I
                  do?"</p>
               <p>"Have you worked for your living?"</p>
               <p>"No, faith! The woman an' the childers can get the bit o' bread an' mate widout my
                  workin', an' the wea drap o' crater besides!"</p>
               <p>"What did you beat your wife for?"</p>
               <p>"Sure, an' I tould yer honor afore—she took me bottle fra under the straw, an'
                  divil the drap did she lave in it at all—at all!"</p>
               <p>"Let's go," said Hilton, disgusted with the scene.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, to the next floor, it is a little more respectable!" said Ernest
                  leaving the room, and again descending the tottering stairs.</p>
               <p>Standing upon the next flight a minute, Cramer showed his companion that there
                  were more doors in view, signifying that the rooms were smaller. Cramer pushed
                  against one of these, but it appeared to be fast inside.</p>
               <p>"Who's there?" asked a woman, in a strong Irish accent.</p>
               <p>"A friend!" replied Cramer.</p>
               <p>A murmur, as if somebody was aroused beside the woman who spoke, was heard, but
                  the door opened the next instant, and the two young men were admitted to the
                  apartment, which could not be more than eight feet square at the most. In this a
                  single pallet lay upon the floor upon which two young children were sleeping; a
                  girl, whose age might be twelve or thirteen, was seated upon it, rubbing her eyes,
                  as if half awake—while a woman of forty, or thereabouts, in very scant apparel,
                  was standing near the door, with a look of enquiry on her face, as if she wished
                  to know why she was visited. But, as her eye glanced over the genteel exterior of
                  her visitors, a look of pleasure gathered upon her face, and she cried—"Yer honors
                  are looking around for fun, maybe! Well, it's rare fun the widow O'Riley can get
                  up once i' the long while! If it's a purty gal yer lookin' for, here's Norah—"</p>
               <p>"Och—mother—mother—don't let 'em come near me the night!" said the girl,
                  mournfully; "och, mother, dear, let me be asy this night, or I'll die!"</p>
               <p>"What!" muttered Hilton, "would that mother sell her own child to degradation, and
                  shame, and wretchedness?"<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"

               </note>
               <p>"You see for yourself!" said Cramer—"<emph>facts.</emph> not <emph>words</emph>,
                  should convince you, now!"</p>
               <p>"My God—do I stand in a Christian city?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—in a city which sends <emph>millions</emph> of dollars every year to convert
                  the poor <emph>heathen</emph> in far-off lands, not thinking of the heathen in
                  their own midst; in a city where the tender-hearted people will weep over the sins
                  of the unconverted Hottentots, while they forget their own; in a city which will
                  send ships and food to far-off Greece, or nearer Ireland, while the poor are
                  starving oftimes in its streets; a city which boasts of the loftiest churches, the
                  grandest halls, and which permits in its very heart such festering dens of vice
                  and corruption and poverty to exist as we have seen, and can see, this night, or
                     <emph>any</emph> day or night!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough. Let us go!" said Hilton, shuddering.</p>
               <p>"What! and leave all the other rooms unvisited? There's the regular beggars' room,
                  where the lame and the blind, the sore and the ragged, have their quarters."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to see them—I've seen <emph>enough!</emph>" said Hilton, casting a
                  dollar upon the pallet beside the poor shuddering girl who sat there. The old
                  crone, her mother, with a scream of joy, rushed forward and snatched it up; for
                  the poor child had hidden her head with a piece of the dirty, ragged blanket, and
                  moaned as if with some terrible recollection, ever since her heartless parent had
                  spoken.</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>must</emph> see the '<hi rend="i"/>Hurdy-Gurdy Parlor!' It is the
                  best room in the house!" said Cramer, as they again descended to the ground
                  floor.</p>
               <p>Upon reaching the door on the left, all was still, except the sound of snoring and
                  the hard-drawn breathings of slumber; but when Ernest pushed the door open, and
                  the light illuminated the apartment,<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6961-00000036"/> such
                  another chattering couldn't be heard this side of a regular Yankee quilting
                  party.</p>
               <p>"Thunder!" cried Hilton, "where did all these monkies come from?"</p>
               <p>"Look," said Ernest, "at the pillows under the men's heads, and you can guess. I
                  told you this was the hurdy-gurdy room!"</p>
               <p>So it was. There were at least forty people, men, women, and children, stowed away
                  on pallets in the room, and under the head of every man, nearly, was one of those
                  instruments which, during the day, grind out music by the pennyworth for the
                  amusement of our babies and their nurses. To nearly every organ a monkey was
                  chained, and these, aroused by the light and the intrusion, raised the
                  chattering</p>
               <p>There were women there, dark-eyed daughters of Italia, and young children, who had
                  their little cages of white mice fast clasped in their arms, with which, during
                  the day, they had importuned for alms at our hotels, where the generous Southerner
                  and the careless Western man are wont to roost as they travel.</p>
               <p>"Desca! Is Desca here?" asked Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Si Signor!" cried a sweet voice from a far corner of the room, where a blanket
                  tacked up across the angle of the room formed a partition, and in an instant the
                  blanket was dashed aside, and a young creature, who looked too lovely for such a
                  scene and place, sprang forward, and as she saw Cramer, bounded to his side and
                  kissed the hand which he extended to greet her.</p>
               <p>She was a slender figure, yet round and graceful limbed; her dress was national—a
                  bodice of faded blue silk, low in neck, revealing the swelling signs of womanhood;
                  her skirt was a crimson satin, it also faded and worn. A slipper of dark green
                  encased a foot as small as a child's almost. Her jet black hair was bound in a
                  Grecian coif around her beautiful head. Her features indicated her Italian birth;
                  her large dark eyes were <emph>very</emph> lovely to look upon; liquid, brilliant,
                  full of passion and feeling.</p>
               <p>She held a tamborine in her hand, but at the head of the little pallet in the
                  corner stood a guitar.</p>
               <p>"Where is your father?" asked Cramer.</p>
               <p>She pointed to a haggard-faced man, whose head was pillowed on his hand-organ,
                  close before the little pallet where she had been sleeping.</p>
               <p>"He is tire. Much has he walked and played, and yet made no more dan a few penny,"
                  said the young girl, sadly. "Does the Signor want Desca to dance for him?"</p>
               <p>"Not to-night, poor girl! Here is a dollar for your father: have you kept your
                  promise to me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Signor. I promise El Sancta Maria, she keep me from wrong;" and the young
                  girl made the sign of the cross as she spoke.</p>
               <p>Many of the inmates of the room were now awake, and Cramer, handing the girl some
                  money to distribute amongst them, turned away, followed by his friend.</p>
               <p>"You've a singular set of acquaintances!" cried the latter, when they emerged into
                  the street and Cramer had thrown away the candle. "How did you make the
                  acquaintance of that pretty Italian, eh? I thought you was a model of purity!"</p>
               <p>"You have seen nothing to convince you that I am anything else, have you?"</p>
               <p>"No—I did not say that! But you seem to know this girl very well, and the whole
                  gang looked at you as if they had seen you before!"</p>
               <p>"They had; and <emph>she</emph> has seen me frequently. She is grateful to me for
                  a service I once rendered her. I saved her from the insults of a gang of rowdies,
                  when having lost her way, she was wandering about the streets late at night,
                  looking for her father, whom she always accompanies."</p>
               <p>"Is she not one of the lost and abandoned ones?"</p>
               <p>"No; I believe that she is virtuous: I have never seen a sign of indelicacy in her
                  conduct."</p>
               <p>"You see strange adventures, Ernest, in your researches! Your life is quite
                  romantic!"</p>
               <p>"Would to God, all that I am forced to see was not so <emph>real!</emph>" sighed
                  the other, as they passed on toward his boarding-house.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>THERE is a house in Houston street, which has no door plate, to signify the name
                  of its tenant or owner; a large handsome brick house, with handsome marble steps,
                  and an uppertenish look. The window shutters are seldom unclosed; and when they
                  are, crimson curtains are dropped before them, which no prying eye can penetrate.
                  There is a carriage kept by the person who resides there, but it has no coat of
                  arms on its panel—and is seldom used except in the evening, and if used in the day
                  time, the persons who ride out generally enter it in the rear yard where the
                  coach-house stands, and it is driven out with the curtains down, so as to conceal
                  the occupant.</p>
               <p>The servants attached to the house are all Irish, and inquisitive neighbors have
                  often, but in vain, striven to learn who was the owner, tenant, or tenants of the
                  building.</p>
               <p>Sometimes rich looking equipages stood before the door—there were many visitors,
                  but who they visited, or what was their business, could not be discovered. A
                  perplexing veil of mystery covered all.</p>
               <p>But, reader, we will strive to unveil it, that is if you dare to follow me through
                  all that must be passed.</p>
               <p>On the evening which Cramer had pronounced "blessed," because of his introduction
                  to that lovely incarnation of all that his soul had imagined of beauty, grace,
                  passion and feeling, "La Belle Serena"—a tall, singular looking man was pacing to
                  and fro in a room in this building. I say he was "singular looking," because there
                  was that in his appearance, which having once seen, you could not forget. His
                  figure was tall, his features good, but in his high, noble forehead—an eye of the
                  deepest black, large and bright; in his lips which were thin, pale, and closed, as
                  he walked to and fro, the physiognomist mist could easily read that he was one
                  accustomed to command and to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>His dress was a plain black gown, which enveloped him from head to foot, but on
                  the left breast of this was a cross of diamonds, which, to use the words of one
                  more gifted than I, "was well worth the ransom of a king." This glittering
                  insignia was not needed, however, to tell the beholder that his profession was
                     <emph>priestly</emph>, for <emph>that</emph> could be seen in his manner and
                  his look.</p>
               <p>His manner as he paced to and fro, indicated that he expected a visitor, for his
                  eye was often turned towards the only door that opened into the room, and in a low
                  voice, he frequently muttered, looking at his watch, "She is late—she is
                  late!"</p>
               <p>Who was the "<emph>she</emph>," that a priest should expect to visit him in the
                  dimness of the <emph>evening</emph>, the hour which those who <emph>profess</emph>
                  to be journeymen soul-savers should dedicate to meditation. Let her answer for
                  herself.</p>
               <p>A slight tap, repeated twice or thrice nervously at the door, was heard by the
                  individual whom I have but partially described, and a smile of satisfaction
                  flitted over his thin face as he hastened to open the door.</p>
               <p>A lady entered—a beautiful lady—who bowed very low as she came in, and crossing
                  her hands upon her bosom, said:</p>
               <p>"Eminence! You sent for your servant—I am here!"</p>
               <p>"Gulietta—use no ceremony now! Call me Francesco, as you did when I was but a
                  simple monk, you the loveliest nun that ever took the veil!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence—I am still what I <emph>was</emph>, you are what you <emph>are!</emph>"
                  and the head of the lovely lady was still bowed, and her dark, fringed eye-lids
                  meekly cast down.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Gulietta!</emph>" cried the man, in a voice deep and thrilling as the tone
                  of a tolling bell, "have you <emph>forgotten</emph> Francesco?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, never, Eminence, <emph>never!</emph> But—forgive poor Gulietta! Eminence—she
                  would not offend!"</p>
               <p>"She will offend, unless she at once ceases to regard my office, and looks upon me
                  as she once did upon Francesco!" said the priest,<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000038"/> or Bishop, or Cardinal, or whatever he was—at the
                  same time pressing his arm around her slender waist, and pressing his lips to her
                  brow.</p>
               <p>She blushed to the temples as he did this, and raising her eyes to his,
                  murmured—"Oh, this is too much happiness!"</p>
               <p>He smiled, and pressed his lips to hers. Oh, how warm and passionately did she
                  return his kiss.</p>
               <p>"Francesco! Francesco!" she murmured.</p>
               <p>For a few moments he held her thus in his arms, then gently seating her, he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I sent for you to-night, Gulietta, on important business. You have a duty to
                  perform for the good of the Church!"</p>
               <p>"My life is at the service of the Church and the cause, Eminence!" replied the
                  lovely woman.</p>
               <p>"Your life will not be endangered in the service I demand, Gulietta," said the
                  priest: "it is a service which, with your beauty and accomplishments, will be
                  easy, and yet it is important. You know well the arts of love—how to win the heart
                  of man!"</p>
               <p>The lady blushed a reply, but did not speak. The priest gazed upon her lovely face
                  a moment, and then continued:</p>
               <p>"You have been selected from all the band of Sisters, Gulietta, to do this
                  important service, and I expect success to crown your efforts. You cannot
                  fail!"</p>
               <p>"What am I to do, Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"You are expected to win the heart of a fervent, enthusiastic, open-hearted man—to
                  win his love, and having won it, through your influence, to lure him on to
                  ruin!"</p>
               <p>"Suppose I fail, Eminence? My charms are not what they were when—"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>must</emph> not fail!" and the priest's brow grew dark as he spoke,
                  interrupting her.</p>
               <p>"Who is to be the victim, Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"One who <emph>must</emph> be crushed, for he is an enemy to our order—he is
                  shaking the foundations of the pillars of our house!"</p>
               <p>"Why do you not use the dagger or the poisoned cup?"</p>
               <p>"Because it would not help us so much as to crush and disgrace him, and thereby
                  annul all that he has done against us. He has sown seed which, if it grows, will
                  rise up to our injury, and his blood, if it were shed, would water it and
                  strengthen its growth. No, we must not slay him: we must wither his hands, blacken
                  his name, make it a bye-word and a mockery among men, then all that he has said
                  will be forgotten and lost!"</p>
               <p>"Your Eminence is wise; I am your servant. What am I to do how am I to
                  proceed?"</p>
               <p>"You will be furnished with funds to a large amount. You will proceed in disguise
                  to Philadelphia, and there purchase a most elegant wardrobe of half-mourning. You
                  will purchase jewelry of the richest and rarest kind; everything of the most
                  genteel and chaste kind, for he is a man of taste. Having thus prepared to pass
                  yourself for a rich Southern widow of twenty-two—"</p>
               <p>"But, Eminence, I am already twenty-six!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, child! you could pass for eighteen!—But do not interrupt me. Having prepared
                  to pass as a wealthy young widow, you will arrive with your trunks and your
                  servant at the Astor House—"</p>
               <p>"My <emph>servant?</emph> I have none, your Eminence!"</p>
               <p>"Why do you interrupt me?" cried the priest, angrily.</p>
               <p>"Pardon, Eminence, pardon poor Gulietta!" and the fair creature knelt at his
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"Rise, my girl, rise—I am not offended. I have already engaged a most excellent
                  companion and servant maid for you, an Italian girl, a daughter to a sworn and
                  devoted servant of ours. I have selected her because she speaks your language—is
                  young and artless, and I have higher aims for her, and wish her placed under your
                  tuition."</p>
               <p>"Is her name a secret, Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"No, it is <hi rend="i"/>Desca del Onda!"</p>
               <p>"Has she been educated?"</p>
               <p>"No; her father is one of our Band of Secret Spies. He has been a
                  street-musician—she has played and sung with him; but she is beautiful and
                  talented—she <emph>must belong to us!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The lady sighed, but made no reply. The priest continued:</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6961-00000039"/>
               <p>"After taking lodgings at the Astor, you will seek for private lodgings; and I
                  will see that you get them in the same house where <emph>he</emph> is living. The
                  lady who keeps the house is a true daughter of the Church; she is the widow of an
                  Irish gentleman, who was killed in a duel in Ireland, O'Brien Laurel, the second
                  son of Sir Richard Laurel, of Ghorn Castle. I tell you these particulars, so that
                  you may thoroughly understand your position."</p>
               <p>"Your eminence has not yet told me the name of the enemy!"</p>
               <p>"True—his name is Ernest Cramer!"</p>
               <p>"The author!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—but why do you blush? Have you ever seen him?"</p>
               <p>"No, Eminence—but I once read a strange story from his pen, which I can never
                  forget. The scene was laid in a Southern Isle, and—"</p>
               <p>"Poh, child, I wish not to hear of his stories! Let it suffice thee, that he is a
                  heretic and an enemy to our holy order. He must be <emph>crushed;</emph> your duty
                  is to do it!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence—to hear is to obey! Your blessing?"</p>
               <p>Oh, what a mockery of religion! That man, whose heart was so full of guile, raised
                  hands which, for aught we know, had been stained with human blood, and spreading
                  them over the head of that guilty, passion-ful woman, invoked the blessing of the
                  Holy Trinity upon her!</p>
               <p>Then—ere he allowed her to pass away, he pressed his sensual mouth to her warm and
                  glowing lips in a kiss, as unchaste as the salute of a harlot to her victim. He
                  gave her a few more directions, and then she left the room.</p>
               <p>After he was again alone, he looked once more at his watch. "Fifteen minutes to
                  eleven!" he muttered—"he will be here at eleven. What can Manton mean by sending
                  him to me? He writes that he is to confer with me on important business, which
                  nearly concerns me. I have nothing in common with Manton or his class. It is true,
                  I occasionally for excitement risk a few hundred dollars of our funds at his bank;
                  if I win, I come away quietly as I enter: if I lose, it is the same. He alone
                  knows me to be what I am, and it was by accident, and his Irish dealer's
                  stupidity, that he found out that. What can he mean by sending an agent to me? But
                  I must be prepared for him!"</p>
               <p>The priest rang a small bell which lay on a table by his hand. In a moment a
                  servant entered, and, bowing low, without speaking, awaited his orders.</p>
               <p>"Dennis—I wish a fine supper on the table here, in fifteen minutes—two plates
                  only. Let the best wine be brought from the cellar. When my company has arrived
                  you will alone remain, and hark you—you must be mute and deaf!"</p>
               <p>The servant bowed his reply, and left the room. Returning shortly, he prepared a
                  table as directed, and at the precise time, he broke the silence, by informing the
                  priest that all was ready. The latter again glanced at his watch.</p>
               <p>"A minute beyond the time!" he muttered, impatiently. But, at the same instant, a
                  ringing bell was heard, and, in a minute afterward, another servant entered, and,
                  bowing with deferential respect, handed him a card. He read it, and muttered:</p>
               <p>"This then is he. Judas I. Arnold! A singular name!"</p>
               <p>Then turning to the servant, he added—"Invite the gentleman in!"</p>
               <p>A minute elapsed, and a man about the middle height, of slender figure, dressed
                  genteelly, entered.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Arnold?" asked the priest, glancing from the card to the man.</p>
               <p>"The same, Reverend sir, at your service!"</p>
               <p>"Be seated, sir. I am rejoiced to see you. I waited supper a few moments for
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"You do me too much honor, Reverend sir!"</p>
               <p>"No compliment, sir—I beg. Sit down, and as we sup, we will converse!"</p>
               <p>The man, Arnold, merits a full description. As I said before, he was of medium
                  height, and slim in figure. His features were rather slim but regular; the
                  expression of his countenance, at a first glance, seemed open and pleasing, but
                  when it was studied, you could see in<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6961-00000040"/> the
                  keen black eye and thin lip, a look of cunning and treachery that would, very
                  naturally, make you suspicious of him. His hair was black, worn rather long,
                  straight, and was plastered sleekly down upon his cheeks with oil. He looked mild,
                  gentlemanly, somewhat like a lawyer, would not have looked very unlike a preacher,
                  if he had worn a white neckcloth.</p>
               <p>When seated at the table, and the wine had been placed before them, their glasses
                  were filled:</p>
               <p>"To your health, sir!" said the priest.</p>
               <p>"To the destruction of our enemies!" said Arnold, emptying his glass.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Our</emph> enemies? Do you belong to us?" asked the priest, with a look of
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"I do not belong to the order of which your Reverence is the head in America,"
                  replied the other—"Yet, may not our enemies be the same?"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you!"</p>
               <p>"Then Manton did not explain to you?"</p>
               <p>"He merely said in a note that you were in every way trust worthy, and would
                  confer with me upon a matter which deeply interested me!"</p>
               <p>"Ah—he said no more? Then I will explain. You and your order have a dangerous
                  enemy in one Ernest Cramer, a young American, who, by his pen and his harangues
                  before secret societies of his fellow-countrymen, has done much to expose your
                  aims, and thwart your objects!"</p>
               <p>"It is true—but what of him?"</p>
               <p>"He is also the enemy of Manton, and all the sporting gentlemen of New York. He
                  denounces gambling as <emph>thievery</emph>, exposes the tricks, places, and
                  persons of the sporting men—and often steps in and takes game from our hands, when
                  it is almost safe within our net. We wish him destroyed—so do you! We do not wish
                  to risk a <emph>murder!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No—there is such a thing as <emph>murdering</emph> without taking life!" said the
                  priest. There is such a thing as leading a man into a snare, from which he cannot
                  escape—there is such a thing as damning his name, blasting his character, driving
                  him to crime, want and beggary, and for such a fate I would spare him. Had we
                  known him in time, the knife or poison should have stilled his voice and removed
                  the danger—but he has said and written so much, that to slay him now would be to
                  help his cause, for others would rise to avenge him, and carry out his views.
                  No—we must degrade and ruin his cause through himself! I have already taken
                  preparatory steps!"</p>
               <p>"May I ask your Reverence what they are?"</p>
               <p>"I have prepared to cast a lovely, talented and most finished coquette in his
                  path, who will win him to almost any point, if I judge his character aright."</p>
               <p>"The plan is good!"</p>
               <p>"Had you any plan formed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—one that will not interfere with yours. I am well paid for my work, and shall
                  take a bold step. I shall receive an introduction to him on to-morrow—I shall
                  flatter his talents—shall express sympathy in his labors, offer my
                  services—pecuniary and personal, to him in his labors for reform. I shall endeavor
                  to become a member of the American Orders, to which he belongs, and being once
                  with them, you may trust me that I will not only soon learn all their secrets, but
                  so poison them against him, that they will cast him forth with scorn and loathing
                  from <choice>
                     <sic>ther</sic>
                     <corr>their</corr>
                  </choice> midst!"</p>
               <p>Magnificent! The plan is splendidly conceived! Yes, you will win his
                  confidence—become his <emph>brother</emph>, and we can learn all his aims and
                  plans, and at last crush him through his own friends! We cannot fail now! Sir, I
                  am delighted to see you and to make your acquaintance. Fill another bumper—I'll
                  drink you a new toast!"</p>
               <p>The glasses were filled to the brim. The priest raised his:</p>
               <p>"Here is wine and women, religion for fools, and eternal destruction to all foes!"
                  he cried, draining it to the last drop.</p>
               <p>What a sentiment to be breathed from the lips of a professed follower of the meek
                  and holy Jesus—what words for an <emph>avowedly chaste</emph> and humble
                  Christian, to use. Even Judas Arnold seemed astonished, and he was a
                     <emph>hard</emph> villain to move, for he hesitated to drink</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6961-00000041"/>
               <p>The priest noticed this, and smiled.</p>
               <p>"You are astonished at my words!" he said. "You would not be if you had studied as
                  I have studied. The truth is, that the less <emph>knowledge</emph> you possess,
                  the more <emph>faith</emph> you have, the better Christian you will be! But I have
                  a question to ask—are you an American?"</p>
               <p>"I am!"</p>
               <p>"A Catholic?"</p>
               <p>"No, I have never troubled my head about religion!"</p>
               <p>"You have a singular name!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> It is Judas Iscariot Arnold. My father who was a misanthrope,
                  affixed the two first names, as he said to tally with the last—but he was
                  insane—he died at the Mad House, on Blackwell's Island!"</p>
               <p>"I presume too much perhaps, on your private feelings, but are you a descendant of
                  Benedict Arnold?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—a grandson—his <emph>only</emph> grandson—the last of the stock, and by the
                  God who made me, I mean to be worthy of the breed! They have stamped our name with
                  infamy—I'll uphold it, and be an Arnold while I exist!"</p>
               <p>"I like your spirit! Your ancestor was a wronged man!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—wrong drove him to wrong—but it matters not—to our present business. You hate
                  Cramer, because he is an enemy to your church and order; I <emph>personally</emph>
                  hate him because he is an American in <emph>heart</emph> and <emph>soul</emph>, as
                  well as name; I persecute him apart from this, because I am well paid by men who
                  must crush him or be crushed themselves. They have tried to kill him. They have
                  tried to lure him into traps where assassination would be safe and easy, but in
                  that he has foiled them. Once a note was sent to him, telling him that a beautiful
                  woman wished to see him at a certain house in Liberty street, at a certain hour.
                  When the hour came, a posse of Mattsel's special police came in his place, and it
                  was with difficulty that the heads of the plan escaped arrest. We tried poison—but
                  luck seems to be on his side, he won't <emph>be</emph> killed, and if he
                     <emph>was,</emph> I doubt whether he'd stay killed, for I have heard that he
                  was killed two or three times already, and he has come to life again!"</p>
               <p>The priest had listened attentively to these remarks, and after Arnold had
                  stopped, he remained <choice>
                     <sic>burried</sic>
                     <corr>buried</corr>
                  </choice> in deep thought for several minutes—a lapse of time which his companion
                  filled up by "turning to" at the eatables before him. At last the priest
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"This young man"—said he, "is but one of many who think and feel as he does.
                     <emph>He</emph>, more bold and reckless than they, comes out and speaks his
                  sentiments freely; <emph>they</emph> will soon do the same. They <emph>must</emph>
                  be crushed, or we as an Order will perish from the face of the earth!"</p>
               <p>"More truth than poetry there. And we gentlemen of pleasure—we too must be rid of
                  him, else he will <emph>force</emph> the officers of the law to prosecute us—or
                  have new officers put in power, who <emph>will</emph> enforce the law, and that
                  would drive us to Texas, or some other hot country!"</p>
               <p>"You are well paid by Manton and his party, you said!"</p>
               <p>"I am,"—replied Arnold.</p>
               <p>"You shall also be pensioned from our treasury!" continued the priest. "But we
                  must act in concert—you must implicitly follow my directions!"</p>
               <p>"I shall be but too happy to act under the advice of so wise a leader as your
                  Reverence!"</p>
               <p>"It is well. Your plan to join his Order and become apparently his devoted
                     <emph>friend</emph>, interested in the same cause, must be carried out
                  immediately. You can act in concert with the others whom I have placed in the same
                  business!"</p>
               <p>This matter settled, we will leave this scene and allow the gentlemen to enjoy
                  their supper, though it is <emph>possible</emph>, we may return to them before
                  they have finished, and learn more of the secrets of that singular
                  dwelling—secrets, which if rumors of bright eyes—scantily draped but lovely
                  forms—are true, will show that a Jesuit Priest may imitate a Turkish Sultan in
                  other things than smoking opium, even in the pure and immaculate city of
                  Gotham.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V</head>
               <p>ONE night had only passed over his head, since that on which he had made the
                  acquaintance of La Belle Serena—the night he had spent in delivering his American
                  address, and in the visit to Manton's gambling hell, and the scene of misery
                  described in the third chapter, and yet, Ernest felt as if it was a week, so
                  impatient was he to renew his visit to that lovely young lady. He had dressed
                  himself with unusual care, and though the hour was early, he was pacing to and fro
                  in his parlor, impatiently waiting the appearance of his friend Hilton, who had
                  promised again to accompany him to Japonica Place. His usually pale face was
                  flushed, and his manner, usually so calm and stolid, now exhibited nervousness and
                  agitation.</p>
               <p>A tap on his door made him start and turn around, and as he cried "Come in!" his
                  voice was quicker and louder than usual. He looked disappointed when Lizzie Laurel
                  entered, instead of him whom he expected.</p>
               <p>"Why, how you are dressed up, Mr. Cramer!" she cried. "Are you going to a party
                  to-night?"</p>
               <p>"No, Lizzie,—only to pay a visit!"</p>
               <p>"A visit? Then it is to some young lady!"</p>
               <p>"Why do you think so?"</p>
               <p>"Because I never saw you dress so particularly neat before. Tell me, Mr. Cramer,
                     <emph>tell me</emph>," she repeated earnestly, "are you in love?"</p>
               <p>"In <emph>love</emph>, you silly girl," replied Ernest, blushing in spite of
                  himself. "have I not told you that I should <emph>never</emph> love again!"</p>
               <p>"And you told a naughty fib when you said so, sir; for though I am but a young
                  girl, I am wise enough to see that you are in love!"</p>
               <p>Cramer made no reply, but seemed thoughtful. Perhaps he was considering if what
                  she said was not true—thinking if he was really in love or not. But she again
                  interrupted his thoughts by her clear, bird-like voice.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow," said she,—"to-morrow, Mr. Cramer, is to be an <emph>era</emph> in my
                  existence!"</p>
               <p>"What is to occur to-morrow, Lizzie?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Poet, I am forever to discard these girlish dresses, and faced
                  pantalettes, to assume the dress of a <emph>woman</emph>, sir,—no longer a
                     <emph>girl</emph>—I am sixteen to-morrow! Can't you write me a piece of poetry
                  for the occasion?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lizzie,—it is a pity that you cannot always be what you are now—a young,
                  happy, artless maiden. Little do you know of the dangers and troubles which beset
                  a girl who possesses youth and beauty, and who—"</p>
               <p>A loud knock at the door interrupted Ernest's moral lecture, and as Lizzie opened
                  it, she blushed to the very temples as she admitted the handsome Lieutenant. She
                  wished to pass out, but Hilton stood in the doorway an instant, intercepting her
                  passage, while he said—</p>
               <p>"You must pardon my rude remark, the other evening, Miss Lizzie!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, do not mention it. My own foolish tongue called it upon myself!" said
                  the young girl, blushing redder than ever.</p>
               <p>"Then I am forgiven?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir; but excuse me, my mother wished me to do an errand, and I came up
                  for that;—Mr. Cramer, ma wants to borrow a couple of sheets of letter paper,
                  please!" said the girl, thinking of this convenient errand very suddenly indeed,
                  and as Ernest more than half suspected, only to make a good excuse for withdrawing
                  the sentinel from the door. He handed her the paper, and Hilton, entering, grasped
                  the extended hand of his friend.</p>
               <p>"Are you ready?" asked Ernest, too eager to offer his friend a seat.</p>
               <p>"Why there's no hurry. It's only seven o'clock: I'll smoke a cigar first, if you
                  please! I want to smoke, and as I am <emph>not</emph> 'the man who smokes in the
                  omnibus,' I'll take a cigar here!"</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6961-00000043"/>
               <p>"Certainly; but I thought we were <emph>late!</emph>" said Cramer, in a tone half
                  impatient, half apologetical.</p>
               <p>Hilton smiled, as he coolly tore a slip of paper from the cover of a magazine on
                  the table, and lighted his cigar.</p>
               <p>"Ernest," said he, "it is my private opinion, that you are, "<emph>a
                  goner</emph>"—you are irretrievably in love, your heart has been carried by a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main</foreign>, the castle has surrendered to
                  the enemy. Come, confess, are you not in love with Serena Clifford?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Candidly</emph>, Harry—<emph>confidentially</emph>, remember, for I will
                  entrust no one, not even herself with the secret, till I am assured of a return of
                  my affection—<emph>I am!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"So I thought—so will every one think, who notes your' actions and altered
                  manner!"</p>
               <p>"Poh—you jest. I am not so badly off as that!"</p>
               <p>"You are just <emph>so</emph>—but are you in a hurry?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no—oh, no, take your time!" replied Cramer, in a tone and in a look which
                  belied his words.</p>
               <p>"Then sit down, and observing the pale blue wreathes of smoke which rise from my
                  lips, philosophise upon the mutability of human hopes! Ha! ha! I should like to
                  hear a <emph>lover</emph> philosophise!"</p>
               <p>"'Harry, he jests at scars, who never felt a wound'—you may be in love yourself
                  before long—don't jest with me!"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! when you catch me in love, expect to discover the passage into the
                  interior world, which Captain Symmes believed in!"</p>
               <p>"So said I, until you introduced me to that incarnation of beauty and grace, La
                  Belle Serena!"</p>
               <p>"But I had already withstood the artillery of her charms, without
                  surrendering—there is a proof that I am not so susceptible as you!"</p>
               <p>"A proof that you could not appreciate a woman who cannot be matched on earth!
                  Harry—did I possess all the world at this moment, and would have to become
                  penniless, and be forced to labor for my bare subsistence and hers, to possess
                  her, I would gladly resign power, wealth, <emph>all</emph>—yes, all the
                  world!"</p>
               <p>"Yours is a desperate case!" said Hilton, laughing. "Matrimony only can cure
                  it—but come, I'll not keep you back any longer—we'll start!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>An half an hour later, Ernest Cramer and his friend Hilton were ushered in the
                  parlor of Mr. Clifford, and the enchanted stood in the presence of the lovely
                  enchantress. Never did woman look lovelier than she on that occasion. Her dress
                  was a dark purple satin, low in the neck, the short sleeves leaving her beautiful
                  arms bare almost to the shoulder. The bodice was long and pointed, revealing the
                  contour of her faultless bust, the roundness of her waist, and the swelling
                  proportions of a figure which needed no artificial padding. The color of the
                  dress, by its contrast, made her fair skin look like alabaster tinted with the
                  hues of the rose. Her hair hung as usual in a profusion of glossy curls. A little
                  cottage apron, made her look "at home," and her foot was cased in a delicately
                  worked slipper, trimmed with blue, which set off the silk, fleshed-colored
                  stockings and perfect ancle to a thought. Her manner was warm and unaffected as
                  she welcomed the young men.</p>
               <p>"I expected you!" she said, when they were seated. "Mr Cramer promised to call
                     <emph>soon</emph> again!"</p>
               <p>The heart of Cramer beat wildly beneath her glance, as she spoke then, and he felt
                  that there was a deeper expression in her look than there was in her words merely;
                  an expression which awakened a tumult of hopes and wishes in his heart.</p>
               <p>"I should certainly have called last night if I had not been previously engaged,
                  Miss Serena!" he said.</p>
               <p>"You delivered an address, last evening, did you not, sir? I saw a notice in a
                  morning paper that you were expected to!"</p>
               <p>"I had the pleasure to do so, lady."</p>
               <p>"And I the pleasure of being present!" said Hilton. "Ah, Miss Serena, you should
                  have been there to see what warm friends Ernest has!"</p>
               <p>"It would have given me pleasure to have heard him—you must extend an invitation
                  to me when your next address is to be delivered!" said the lady.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6961-00000044"/>
               <p>"I fear your expectations will be disappointed, lady, if you go. I am but an
                  impractised speaker, and make no claims to graceful oratory!"</p>
               <p>"Of that, let me judge for myself!" said the young lady, smiling "When will you
                  speak again?"</p>
               <p>"On the evening of the twenty-second of the month, lady, the anniversary of the
                  birth of Liberty's first-born and favorite son, Washington!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I must hear you then! The subject is so grand, you could not fail to do well
                  with that!"</p>
               <p>"I shall feel but <emph>too</emph> proud, lady, to have you among my auditors!"
                  replied Cramer in a tone and with a look which heightened the color on her fair
                  cheek.</p>
               <p>Hilton, who had passed to the centre-table, and seating himself by it, taking up a
                  newspaper, now uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Ernest," said he, "was not the name of the young man you warned from the gambling
                  table last night, Hagerman?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—what of him?"</p>
               <p>"The Evening Mirror states here that a Mr. Hagerman, an officer in the —— Bank,
                  has fled, and it is feared has taken funds belonging to the bank, amounting to 50
                  or 60,000 dollars."</p>
               <p>"Even as I feared, but not so soon—I hoped to see him before he could take such a
                  step—I should have done it this afternoon, had not a visit detained me. God keep
                  and comfort his poor wife!"</p>
               <p>"I saw the article in the paper: did you know the young man?" asked the lady of
                  Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Only by sight; yet, last night, or rather this morning, at one o'clock, I stood
                  by his side in a gambling hell, and in vain tried to stay his hand and save him
                  from ruin."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> in a gambling house, Mr. Cramer! I should think your life would
                  not be safe a moment! You, who so boldly denounce their crimes and persons!"</p>
               <p>"I was there in a disguise which they could not penetrate. Oh, Miss Clifford! had
                  you seen the weeping wife of young Hagerman, only the day before, as she implored
                  me to save the husband of her love from ruin, you would not wonder that I would
                  risk much to save him. She had already learned his crime; she knew that he had
                  robbed the bank—knew that he had been false in his conjugal vows; and yet, with
                  woman's constancy, she hoped and prayed for his reclamation. She would not condemn
                  or desert him; she would not drive him forth desperate and alone in the world;
                  and, knowing my aims and objects of action, she came to me for aid. I promised it;
                  last night I commenced, but it was too late, I fear. If he has fled, and she is,
                  as I feel sure, left behind by the heartless villain, she is broken-hearted."</p>
               <p>"Poor woman! my heart bleeds for her. Had she children?"</p>
               <p>"One, a sweet boy, just old enough to lisp the name of his parents!"</p>
               <p>"And will he no more know his father? Will that poor child look in vain for the
                  aid and protecting hand of a father?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! yes; and I fear he will see his mother pale, and droop and die like an
                  unwatered flower in life's desert!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Cramer! I do not now wonder at your vehemence in condemning the
                  gamblers—at your bitterness in denouncing the class who can produce such
                  desolation!"</p>
               <p>"Lady, you see but one isolated case. I can name one hundred <emph>facts,</emph>
                  aye, and point you to the persons—<unclear>name</unclear> them and their
                  destroyers, each of which would as keenly wring your heart as this. I could tell
                  you of a widowed lady, left with two beautiful and promising children, one a girl
                  just budding into womanhood, the other a son verging on his twentieth year. She
                  had a little property, sold it, and converted it into cash to start her son in
                  business. He opened a store—soon began to do a very comfortable business, and his
                  income was a handsome support for himself, mother and sister. They all lived
                  together, and as that sister afterwards told me, lived as happy as the day was
                  long. She was well educated and accomplished, and when her brother's business was
                  over at evenings, he always came home, and with conversation and music they
                  pleasantly passed away the leisure hours. But the DEMONS of the city crossed his
                  path—he was enticed into a gambling hell. At first <emph>allowed</emph> to
                     <emph>win,</emph> as is ever the<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6961-00000045"/> case,
                  he became infatuated with the belief that gambling was indeed the turning of
                  FORTUNE'S wheel;—he believed or hoped to win a fortune, and soon he lost his all;
                  nay more, for in an hour of madness and drunken desperation he actually staked the
                  honor of his virtuous sister—staked it, and lost, and before he was sobered into
                  his senses, had betrayed her into a gambler's hands—betrayed her, a drugged and
                  helpless being, to a wretch who knew no mercy; and (forgive me for speaking so
                  plainly, lady; but I tell the <emph>truth</emph>) she was lost! I will briefly
                  tell you the fate of that family. This sister is now in her grave; but she lived
                  two years of wretchedness as a courtezan, before she died; the brother is an
                  inmate of Sing Sing, for forgery; his mother is a raving maniac in a mad-house.
                  This is but one of many cases where I can point out death, desolation, and
                  madness, as resulting directly from the hands of the gamblers of New York! Why
                  then should I not detest them—why not denounce and expose them—why not endeavor to
                  save victims from their grasp."</p>
               <p>"Oh, most true, Mr. Cramer! And all that I wonder at is, that the whole moral
                  community does not rise <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse</foreign> to aid you in
                  your glorious work!"</p>
               <p>"They are too selfish, lady. Selfishness is the order of the day. Everybody looks
                  out for number <emph>one</emph>, and cares not what befalls his neighbor. Those
                  who wish to appear benevolent or philanthropic, have such vastly-extended ideas,
                  that they can see no poverty, no crime, no suffering <emph>this</emph> side of the
                  Sandwich Islands, or the China Seas—they cannot be made to believe, that men,
                  women and children <emph>starve</emph> in our midst; that young girls are forced
                  to sell their virtue for the bread which they cannot earn at the wages offered for
                  labor, that maniacs can be seen in our mad-houses—who shout "hunger—hunger and
                  want!"—that widows and orphans of our own proud land, are side by side with the
                  servile herds of foreign paupers, who fill our Alms Houses!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Cramer, what a picture you paint!"</p>
               <p>"Yet, lady, as my Maker is my judge, I am only speaking the <emph>truth!</emph> To
                  remedy the evils I describe, I <emph>have</emph> labored, <emph>do</emph> labor,
                     <emph>will</emph> labor, so long as my life is spared!"</p>
               <p>"It is a glorious work. Oh, Mr. Cramer, how few understand you or your motives! As
                  a young and promising writer, I have admired your talents, had read your works
                  with great pleasure—but I thought your ambition was to become famous as a writer.
                  Now I see that you have a nobler, a holier aim!"</p>
               <p>"Lady, I do not deny that I am ambitious—who is not? But my ambition is to serve
                  my beloved country—to aid and be <emph>beloved</emph> by my countrymen; to help
                  those who are friendless—to feed the starving, to aid the vicious in turning back
                  to virtue—to punish the sharks who <emph>destroy</emph> humanity. It is my
                     <emph>choice</emph> to do this—I have voluntarily assumed the work, knowing
                  that danger and opposition, and very probably <emph>death</emph>, is in the path
                  before me!"</p>
               <p>"Not <emph>Death</emph>—oh, I hope not so!" a tear started in Serena's eyes as she
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"Lady—I could die to believe that you felt an interest in my life so great an
                  interest as to weep at my death!"</p>
               <p>She blushed crimson to the very temples, as with her white hand she dashed the
                  tear aside, which was already coursing down her cheek.</p>
               <p>"If at the <emph>thought</emph> I weep, surely should I, at the reality!" she
                  murmured in a voice trembling with agitation.</p>
               <p>He made no reply—neither of them spoke for several minutes. Both of them were
                  embarrassed. Both of them had said too much, not to wish to say more—yet neither
                  dared to proceed. Young love is timid as an infant—and when it yields itself, is
                  all as trusting.</p>
               <p>After a few minutes, during which neither spoke, Serena arose, as of determined to
                  change the scene, and taking a seat at the piano, struck up a lively waltz. Ernest
                  followed her—but he did not seem to heed the music. As he stood at one corner of
                  the piano, he gazed upon her lovely face—gazed steadily, as if he was reading his
                  fate in the lovely book of Nature before him. She did not look up at him, but her
                  flushed cheek, the quivering eyelashes drooped low on that cheek, and her heaving
                  bosom, told him a tale which flattered his hopes.</p>

               <p>In the fourth chapter we left "His Eminence," and Judas Iscariot Arnold, supping
                  quite cosily together, having come to a business and personal understanding, which
                  seemed agreeable to both. And at the close of that chapter, I said that possibly I
                  might draw the curtains aside, and exhibit the continuation of the revel, and show
                  how the "austerity, poverty and chastity" which his <emph>vows</emph> imposed upon
                  him, is carried out by a Jesuit Priest. We left them at half-past eleven—choice
                  viands and generous wine before them. We will return at one, an hour past
                  midnight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold's usually pale face has become crimsoned with wine, his small black eye
                  sparkles like a coal of fire, his manner before <emph>assumedly</emph> meek, is
                  now bold and swaggering. He seems to be pretty well "in for it"—as nearly "tight"
                  as one can be and keep a perpendicular position. "His Eminence" don't seem to be
                  much better off. His haughty demeanor has passed away—he smiles continually—his
                  cheeks and brow are flushed, and a sensual expression marks the countenance which
                  so lately appeared severely dignified and nobly intellectual.</p>
               <p>The same servant attended them, and as bottle after bottle was emptied, supplied
                  more.</p>
               <p>"Your rev-reverence," said Arnold, hiccupping a little, "d-do you ev-ever
                  s-sing?"</p>
               <p>"At high mass I sing like a bull!" and the priest laughed, as he replied.</p>
               <p>"B-but I don't mean none of your psalm t-tunes. Ca-can't you sing us a jolly good
                  song with a cho-chorus?"</p>
               <p>"I'm too sober yet. for that. I never sing till I'm two-thirds toddied!"</p>
               <p>"J-just so with me! I've a cap-capital voice, but it wants mel-mellowing."</p>
               <p>"If you're fond of music and dancing, my boy, I can please you Dennis—have the
                  ladies retired?"</p>
               <p>"I will see, Eminence!" replied the servant, starting to leave the room. At a sign
                  from the priest, he returned to his side, and the latter whispered an order in his
                  ear, which Arnold could not hear.</p>
               <p>The servant bowed and left the room to obey his directions.</p>
               <p>"Let's f-fill up our gl-glasses!" cried Arnold. Speaking o' music and
                  dance—dancing's put me in mind 'f a toast, a dev-devilish good toast!"</p>
               <p>"What is it—let's hear!" cried the priest, filling the glasses.</p>
               <p>"May we soon hear Cr-Cramer's groans for mu-music, and see him dan-dance on
                     <emph>nothing</emph> for a car—carpet! Ain't that one o' tha-<emph>the</emph>
                  toasts?"</p>
               <p>"Hark! <emph>There's</emph> music! What do you think of that?"</p>
               <p>Arnold did not reply to the priest. He fairly held his breath, between
                  astonishment and desire to hear the singular music which seemed to fill the very
                  air they breathed. It seemed to be at one moment close beside them, then again it
                  sounded faint and low, as if it was far off. At one moment, it was sad and
                  mournful as the sighings of the broken-hearted, then gay as the song of the
                  humming-bird; one instant, it was like the merry waltz of the Spanish maiden, then
                  it was like the martial march of a hero's choice. At last it seemed to come nearer
                  and nearer—it was <emph>now</emph> a march—until it filled the room with its
                  swelling sounds. Suddenly what appeared to be a ceiling at the back of the room
                  moved aside, showing a large room beyond, furnished in a style which would vie
                  with any Eastern boudoir or court in existence. But Arnold's eye did not glance at
                  the silken carpets, the velvet hangings, the golden chandeliers, the voluptuous
                  paintings. Twelve of the fairest women that ever eye gazed upon, were seen with a
                  slow and measured step, full of grace, marching around the large apartment to the
                  sound of music played by persons and instruments, which were unseen. Each was
                  dressed in some fanciful costume; no two were robed alike. In truth, two or three
                  could scarcely be said to be dressed at all, so scanty was the drapery placed to
                  ornament, rather than conceal their lovely figures. Others were dressed as
                  sultanas—Georgian slaves, Grecian maidens, each in a style that best displayed her
                  peculiar beauty.</p>
               <p>Arnold gazed on, but he could not speak. The priest watched <emph>him</emph>, but
                  appeared careless of the exhibition. It was probably nothing <emph>new</emph> to
                  him. Meanwhile, the music, at first so grand and slow,<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000047"/> quickened its time, changing from a march to a
                  dance. And as this occurred, the small feet, some bare and white as snow-drops,
                  others sandalled in silk, still others cased in the crimson boot of the Polish
                  maiden, glanced quick and quicker over the floor; the lovely figures darted hither
                  and thither in the mazy dance; bare arms and snowy shoulders, bosoms of alabaster
                  rose-tinted, flashing in the light, a scene too voluptuously beautiful for
                  description. Eyes black as jet, and bright as Golconda's gems; eyes blue as
                  heaven, soft and liquid as the dew-drop nestled in the violet's azure cup; all
                  turned glances melting with love and fiery with passion toward the licentious
                  priest and his wondering companion. Faster and faster still increased the
                  musical-time; faster yet, whirled the lovely daughters of Sin, until the very
                  brain of Arnold seemed turning and whirling with them.</p>
               <p>The priest marked his bewilderment, and laughed merrily. The laugh was echoed by
                  the bird-like voices of the dancers, who now, at a sign from the priest, circled
                  nearer and nearer, until they were whirling around the table. Arnold felt the warm
                  breath from rosy lips on his heated brow—their long silken hair brushed his
                  flushed cheeks, as floating on the air it half-draped their lovely necks and
                  shoulders. He reached out his arms to clasp a glowing beauty to his breast, and,
                  as she darted lightly from his reach, he fell forward, stupid and senseless, on
                  the floor.</p>
               <p>IN the last chapter we left Ernest Cramer standing by the piano, before which La
                  Belle Serena was seated. She was playing she scarcely knew what; he certainly
                  didn't know, for he <emph>heard</emph> nothing: his senses all seemed centered in
                  one, that of <emph>sight;</emph> for motionless, dreamily, and abstracted, he
                  stood there gazing upon her loveliness. How long this would have continued, Heaven
                  only knows, had it not been for a hearty laugh from Hilton—a regular "Ha! ha!
                  ha!—ho! ho! ho!—he! he! he!"</p>
               <p>Both Cramer and the lady started, and the former cried:</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Harry? What pleases you so?"</p>
               <p>"A joke—a conundrum as <emph>is</emph> a conundrum—one of Hiram's happiest piest
                  efforts. He says that low tide in a river is precisely like the manly art of
                  self-defence, as taught by his friend Isaiah!"</p>
               <p>"How does he make that out?"</p>
               <p>"He says that both develope the <emph>muscles!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You laugh easier than I do!" said Ernest, with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>But this little interruption served as quite a relief to Serena, for he recovered
                  her composure, and when asked to sing, did so with a voice as clear and full as
                  usual. While she was singing, others entered the parlor; and when she ceased, the
                  conversation became general, and the evening was soon pleasantly passed away. At
                  eleven Hilton reminded Cramer of the hour, and they arose to leave. Again they
                  were accompanied to the door by Miss Clifford. As Ernest lingered, holding her
                  soft hand in his own, he asked:</p>
               <p>"Are you fond of walking, Miss Serena?"</p>
               <p>"Very, Sir! Scarce a day passes that I do not walk out!"</p>
               <p>"I am fond of morning walks—but you ladies seldom rise so early as I."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Fashionable</emph> ladies may not," replied Serena—"but I always rise with
                  the sun. I often take a turn through the Parade Ground before any one is stirring
                  in the streets, except the market girls and milkmen."</p>
               <p>"Then, should I call at an early hour to-morrow, could I have the honor of
                  promenading with you?"</p>
               <p>"If it would be a pleasure to you, sir."</p>
               <p>"Indeed it would, lady—expect me—may angels bring you pleasant dreams!"</p>
               <p>Adieus were exchanged—the door was closed, and the two young men walked down the
                  street.</p>
               <p>"Well, Ernest, what do you think of her on your second visit?" asked Hilton.</p>
               <p>"Don't <emph>talk</emph> to me, Harry, I am too <emph>happy</emph> to talk!" cried
                  Cramer.</p>
               <p>She is a living <emph>angel!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Without the wings!" replied the other, laughing.</p>
               <p>The conversation of the two young men as they proceeded to the lodgings of Cramer,
                  was gay and pleasant, but not of sufficient interest<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000048"/> rest to be recorded here. It was nearly twelve when
                  they arrived, and Cramer invited his companion to share his room with him for the
                  remainder of the night, which the latter frankly accepted.</p>
               <p>On arriving in his room, Cramer observed three or four sealed letters lying upon
                  his table. He seated himself, and commenced reading them, while Hilton, making
                  himself <emph>soldierly</emph> at home, took off his coat and lighted a cigar.</p>
               <p>One of the letters seemed to interest Cramer very much. He read it the second
                  time, and then spoke to Hilton in connection with it.</p>
               <p>"Harry," said he, "I broke my intention of visiting young Hagerman to day, on
                  account of a visit—I told you so, didn't I?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe you did."</p>
               <p>"But I said nothing about my visitor?"</p>
               <p>"Your <emph>visitress</emph>, I presume you mean. Was she pretty, eh—tell me about
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"Harry, you wrong me! It was a man who called upon me, and detained me several
                  hours. The reason that I alluded to him was, that he is the writer of the letter
                  before me. It is a singular document, read it!"</p>
               <p>Hilton took the proffered letter and read it aloud. It was as follows.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>"DEAR SIR,—In my interview of this day, I had not time or composure to
                              say to you all that I desired. Sir, you will, when you know me better,
                              acquit me of adulation or flattery, but I must run the risk of being
                              thought guilty of both, when I say that to-day, to find myself in the
                              presence of one whose pen has not only done much for suffering
                              humanity, but won for him imperishable renown, completely unmanned me,
                              and deprived me of that composure necessary to converse with you.
                              Pardon me, I implore you, sir, and grant me a further interview, for I
                              can aid you <emph>essentially</emph> in the cause I have espoused. I
                              have in a previous note and in my conversation of to-day, I believe,
                              assured you of <emph>facts</emph> which will convince you of my honor
                              and my probity. I assure you, again, sir, that it is my only aim and
                              desire, to follow where your 'white plume' leads, to aid you in your
                              glorious cause of reform. Though I do not possess a tithe of your
                              talents, I have that which may essentially aid you. I have a knowledge
                              of evil, gained by sad experience, and I have wealth which I am
                              anxious to expend in doing good and alleviating misery. I shall, if
                              you please, call upon you again in a day or two and explain my views
                              more fully, especially upon that noble Institution, the American
                              Order, to which you belong.</p>
                           <p>"I am, sir, with admiration and respect, your friend,</p>
                           <closer>

               <p>Hilton shook his head as he looked at the signature—shook it gravely, as if he saw
                  something he didn't like.</p>
               <p>"What do you see out of the way?" asked Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Nothing out of the way, exactly," replied Hilton, "but I don't like to see a man
                  sign his name with such a flourish. He's got a curlycue here half a yard long, and
                  then, the name <emph>Arnold</emph>, I don't like that. I wonder if he's a
                  descendant of <emph>the</emph> Arnold whose name is printed in type of eternal
                  infamy?"</p>
               <p>"No—he mentioned to me that he was not; besides, he is one of the strongest native
                  Americans that you ever heard talk!"</p>
               <p>"Well—you can judge better after seeing the man, than I who have not!"</p>
               <p>"I like him," said Cramer; "he seems so enthusiastic in the cause of reform. It is
                  not <emph>every</emph> man who will come to you and say, 'I am am willing to
                  expend my wealth in doing good. If you see any who suffer, draw on me'!"</p>
               <p>"That's true—I congratulate you, Ernest, in gaining such a recruit. What are those
                  other letters which you are opening, about?"</p>
               <p>"This one is from a young man who is clerk in an Importing House; he has lost
                  funds, collected by him for his employers, lost them at play. He sees the awful
                  position he is in—he confesses his error, and begs my advice and aid to save him,
                  for the sake of his gray-haired parents—to save him, from rain and disgrace!"</p>
               <p>"What can you do for him?"</p>
               <p>"Heaven only knows. I will see him and learn how much he has lost, and whether it
                  can be returned to his employers before they discover their loss. If it can be, it
                  shall!"</p>
               <p>"Can't you force the gamblers to disgorge?"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see champagne squeezed out of a <emph>rock?</emph> You might as well
                  expect to do that, as to recover money that has once got into the iron chest of
                  that foul fiend, Manton!"</p>
               <p>"This then, is one of his victims!"</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6961-00000049"/>
               <p>"So it appears by his letter!"</p>
               <p>"You have not seen him?"</p>
               <p>"Not to my knowledge—you know that we saw at least a hundred there, but I only
                  knew a <emph>few</emph> of them. I may recognise him at our interview, for I shall
                  see him as soon as possible. I will save him, if I can. And now that your cigar is
                  finished, hadn't we better go to bed?"</p>
               <p>"Not till I tell you a story, which a remark of your's, a minute ago, reminded me
                  of. You, by way of comparison, asked if <emph>champagne</emph> could be
                     <emph>squeezed</emph> from a <emph>rock</emph>. I say yes, and can prove it, as
                  you will acknowledge when you've heard my story."</p>
               <p>"Well, go ahead. I'm all attention," said Cramer, <emph>yawning</emph>, when he
                  spoke, like a deacon under a two-hours sermon.</p>
               <p>"We had a curious commissary with us in the South," continued Hilton—"his name was
                     <hi rend="i"/>Jedediah Rock, and he came from New Haven, originally. Any one at
                  the first glance could see that he was a <hi rend="i"/>Yankee. He had a face that
                  looked as if it had been <emph>whittled</emph> out of well-seasoned bass-wood—it
                  looked so dry—dry as a <emph>sponge</emph> hung up in a drug store, and cut sharp
                  at the angles. No one to <emph>look</emph> at him, would think that he ever drank
                  anything stronger than water, but looks are deceiving, as I said, when I tried to
                  kiss a lady 'for the gloves' once, whom I thought to be asleep. She caught me by
                  the under lip with her 'pearly teeth,' and didn't let go till I hallooed blue
                  murder, and promised not to kiss her again till she asked me. But about
                     <emph>Major</emph> Rock, as we called him.</p>
               <p>"Our march from the Punta Nacionale to Jalapa, was one of the <emph>dryest</emph>
                  of the whole campaign. The day had been hot—hot as an attic bed-room in dog-days,
                  when the window is nailed down. It came on night, and we camped as usual, our
                  regiment in advance. The baggage and provision train was away in the rear, and all
                  any of us had to eat, was contained in our haversacks—our canteens had been empty
                  for hours. Now we were in a situation to require <emph>spiritual</emph>
                  consolation, and some of us who knew old Rock <emph>well</emph>, knew that in
                  spite of his temperate <emph>look</emph>, and temperance <emph>talk</emph>, he was
                  in the habit of always carrying some <emph>medicine</emph> with him, to use in
                  case of an attack of his <emph>favorite</emph> enemy, the cholic. So I, feeling
                  confident that he had something in his hamper, (for he being in the staff had a
                  pack-mule allowed him, besides his horse,) mentioned my suspicions to two or three
                  other officers, who were about as full of the devil as I was, and we determined
                  not to be <emph>dry</emph> if we could help it.</p>
               <p>"I commenced operations by sending my servant to him with my compliments for a
                     <emph>little brandy</emph>—as I had a terrible pain in the stomach, and wished
                  to bathe my stomach <emph>outwardly</emph>.</p>
               <p>"The servant came back with the regrets of Major Rock; he was very sorry that he
                  was entirely <emph>out</emph>—thought the <emph>surgeon</emph> could supply
                  me.</p>
               <p>"'What was the Major doing, John?' I asked of the man.</p>
               <p>"'Singing a psalm-tune, sir!'</p>
               <p>"'Then by Jove,' cried Purdy, one of <emph>us</emph> was Purdy, and a
                     <emph>tall</emph> one at that—'he's got liquor. He never sings till his eyes
                  begin to snap, and I'll bet my commission that he's half way "over the bay" now.
                  How <emph>can</emph> we squeeze a drink or two out of him?'</p>
               <p>"'I'll tell you,' said George Ferris, who was another of <emph>us</emph>.—'Harry,
                  you shall go to his tent and have a fit of the cholera morbus, <emph>awful!</emph>
                  I'll follow in three or four minutes, or as soon as I hear you stop groaning, and
                  I'll have it worse than you did. As soon as I get cured, then each of you in turn
                  will follow the same good example.'</p>
               <p>"'Good!' cried the whole party, and we proceeded to '<emph>try it on!</emph>'</p>
               <p>"'In a few minutes, I rushed into Rock's tent, my body almost bent double, both
                  hands pressed to my stomach, my face horribly distorted, groaning worse than I
                  would have done, if they'd been sawing my leg off.'</p>
               <p>"'Brandy—Major, a little brandy, for God's sake,' I cried. 'I'm almost dead with
                  an attack of the cholera morbus!'</p>
               <p>"Rock laid on his blankets, with his saddle for a supporter to his back, and in
                  one corner of the tent lay the 'baggage' from off his pack-mule, very suspiciously
                  covered with a blanket. He was singing 'old hundred' when I entered, but stopped
                     <emph>short</emph> when he saw me.</p>
               <p>"'Quick, Major, quick, or I shall die! Oh—<emph>oh</emph>—my God, Major, why don't
                  you help me! Don't you see I'm dying?'</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6961-00000050"/>
               <p>"As I said this, down I tumbled on his blankets, writhing and kicking, and
                     <emph>accidentally</emph> I turned up one corner of the blankets near his head,
                  revealing to my <emph>astonished(?)</emph> gaze, a bottle of champagne about half
                  emptied.</p>
               <p>"'Oh—thank you, Major—thank you!' I cried grasping the treasure; 'this will save
                  my life!'</p>
               <p>"'St-stop!' stammered the Major. 'It <emph>isn't</emph> brandy—it isn't good for
                  the cholera morbus—it 'll make it worse, it's champagne!'</p>
               <p>"'So it <emph>is!</emph>' I sighed a moment after, heaving the <emph>empty</emph>
                  bottle on the ground; 'but it has done me good—I feel a great deal better Major.
                  My <emph>dear</emph> Major, I do believe you have saved my life!'</p>
               <p>"'Glad of it!' said he in a tone which <emph>implied</emph> 'I wish you was
                  it.—Texas,' at the same time glancing uneasily at the 'baggage' in the corner upon
                  which he saw I had fastened my eye.</p>
               <p>"Just then a horrible groaning was heard outside the tent, then hurried steps, and
                  in rushed George Ferris, groaning as if he hadn't another moment to live.</p>
               <p>"'Bran—oh, brandy—<emph>doc</emph>, Major, I mean!' he yelled. '<emph>Oh</emph>,
                  brandy!' and down he tumbled, rolling and kicking.</p>
               <p>"'I haven't a <emph>drop!</emph>' cried the Major, looking frightened.</p>
               <p>"'Champagne is better than nothing!' said I, giving George a sly wink, and
                  glancing at the 'baggage' knowingly.</p>
               <p>"'Anything to cure this <emph>awful</emph> pain,' cried the sufferer. Oh,
                     <emph>oh!</emph> OH! OH!'</p>
               <p>"At each <hi rend="i"/>oh, he took a roll over and at the last, he brought up
                  against the baggage, and convulsively clutched the blanket.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Then</emph> the Major <emph>groaned</emph>, for as the blanket came off, a
                  champagne basket was revealed, with ten white headed bottles standing in rows with
                  straw comforters around them. He didn't say a word, but he <emph>groaned</emph> as
                  he saw George draw a large knife, dexterously knock the top of the bottle off and
                  apply the opening to his lips. When the bottle was about half empty, George paused
                  to take breath.</p>
               <p>"'I feel <emph>a great deal better!</emph>' said he, with a sigh of
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"'I'm getting worse again,' said I, reaching out my hand for his bottle.</p>
               <p>"Just then another awful groaning was heard and in rushed Purdy.</p>
               <p>"'<emph>What!</emph> you got the cholera morbus too?' cried the Major.</p>
               <p>"'Awful! Oh! <emph>oh!</emph> OH!' groaned Purdy, snatching a fresh bottle from
                  the basket.</p>
               <p>"'The Major now began to smell the <emph>mice</emph>. He saw that he was
                     <emph>sold</emph>, and he determined to make the best of it.</p>
               <p>"'Gentle<emph>men</emph>,' said he—'I'm darned ef I'm <emph>doctor</emph> to the
                  whole regiment, but <emph>ef</emph> you like that medicine, you may have it
                     <emph>ef</emph> you'll pay for it!'</p>
               <p>"'Agreed,' cried we all in a breath. 'What do you ask for it?'</p>
               <p>"'Five dollars a bottle!'</p>
               <p>"'Go in, boys, go in!' was the cry, and we were soon making 'old sogers' out of
                  these bottles. And, unlike <emph>most</emph> doctors, we found the Major wasn't
                  afraid of his own <emph>medicine</emph>. You may well believe there was a 'time'
                  in that tent that night; we made it <emph>ring</emph> again! Now, wasn't that
                  extracting champagne from a <emph>rock</emph>, Ernest?"</p>
               <p>Receiving no reply, Hilton took a second look at Cramer, and found that he was
                     <emph>asleep</emph>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
               <p>ANOTHER day had dawned upon the hero of this history. Hilton had not yet turned
                  out, for soldiers off duty love sleep, as well as a miser loves gold, but Cramer
                  was up and dressed, ready for his morning's walk with Miss Clifford, but as it was
                  not yet time to go, he sat down to answer some letters. As he did this, a lively
                  tap at the door was heard, and in tripped Lizzie Laurel in her new, long dress.
                  What an alteration it made. In truth, she did <emph>now</emph> look like a woman!
                  Her fair cheeks were rosy with a blush, her eyes were brighter and saucier than
                  usual, and as she tripped forward, gaily lifting up her dress to keep from
                  treading on it, she cried:</p>
               <p>"You won't call me a girl <emph>now,</emph> Mr. Cramer, will you?
                  <emph>See</emph>, I have discarded pantalettes and short dresses for ever!"</p>
               <p>"So I perceive, <emph>Miss</emph> Laurel!" said Cramer, bowing in a
                     <emph>very</emph> respectful manner.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you call me <emph>Lizzie</emph>, as you always do?" said the girl,
                  noticing his altered manner.</p>
               <p>"Because you are a young lady, <emph>now</emph>, a <emph>girl</emph> no more!"
                  said he, quoting the words she had used the day before.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cramer, please call me Lizzie, and speak as you used to do. If you talk to me
                  so coldly, because I've put on this dress, I'll not wear it an hour! I'll go and
                  put on my short dresses, so I will!"</p>
               <p>The beautiful girl pouted out her rosy lips, and her dark eye looked liquid, as if
                  a tear was gathering in it.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, Lizzie,—I was only in a joke!" said Ernest, kindly. "But you really
                     <emph>do</emph> look well in that dress. I never thought it <emph>could</emph>
                  so alter and improve your appearance. What a little <emph>woman</emph> you are
                  grown!"</p>
               <p>Lizzie blushed, but it was the blush of pleasure. It pleased her to hear herself
                  called beautiful; she was flattered and delighted with the flattery. And as Ernest
                  gazed upon her he sighed, for he saw to what dangers her beauty and her love of
                  admiration exposed her in a city like this, where libertines are held at a premium
                  in <emph>society</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Ah, there you are sighing again, Mr. Cramer!" cried the sweet girl, resuming her
                  look of gaiety and mischief. "Any man that sighs as often as <emph>you</emph> do,
                     <emph>must</emph> be in love!"</p>
               <p>"I wonder then that you don't sigh, Lizzie; for, if I'm not very much mistaken,
                  you are a little in love yourself!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Me!</emph> oh, what makes you think so, Mr. Cramer?" cried the lovely girl,
                  blushing deeper than ever.</p>
               <p>"Because I thought that you looked very archly at my friend, the Lieutenant, last
                  night!"</p>
               <p>"What! Mr. Hilton? Mercy, Mr. Cramer, I never thought of him five times in my
                  life. He, indeed!—no, <emph>sir</emph>, I don't love <emph>him!</emph>"</p>
               <p>A crash, like a pitcher broken by being dropped on the floor, was heard from the
                  bed-room adjoining the parlor, the door of which was closed.</p>
               <p>"What is that?" cried Lizzie.</p>
               <p>"I guess Mr. Hilton heard you, Lizzie, and has broken the pitcher in despair!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hilton! Is <emph>he</emph> there?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Lizzie; he came home with me last night: I think it probable he heard your
                  remark!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my gracious! what a little fool I am! He always hears what I say!" cried
                  Lizzie, hurrying from the room.</p>
               <p>No sooner did the door close behind her than the bed-room door opened, and Hilton
                  popped out his head, which evidently hadn't made the acquaintance of the
                  hair-brush or comb yet, that morning.</p>
               <p>"Broke your pitcher, Ernest!"</p>
               <p>"How, Harry?"</p>
               <p>"I was just pouring out water in the wash-bowl, and, happening to hear my name
                  mentioned by that little beauty, I stopped to listen—forgot about having the
                  pitcher in my hands, and out it slipped—down it came, and you have a map of China,
                  and an illustration of the inundation of the Nile, on your carpet in here!"</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6961-00000052"/>
               <p>"Well, never mind that. I'll ring for more water: you look as if you needed a
                  little! What's the matter—you look flushed. I hope what you heard Lizzie say,
                  hasn't agitated you?"</p>
               <p>"No, not a bit. I'm always flushed when I first rise; a kind of rush of blood to
                  the head, I believe!"</p>
               <p>"From the <emph>heart</emph>, in this case!" cried Cramer, laughing. Then looking
                  at his watch, he added—"Hurry and dress, Harry. I've ordered an early breakfast,
                  for I'm engaged to take a walk this morning, you know!"</p>
               <p>"So you are: I had forgotten!"</p>
               <p>"Won't you invite Lizzie, and go along?" asked Cramer. "She looks like an angel
                  this morning, in her long dress!"</p>
               <p>"That's a fact, she <emph>did</emph> look well!" said the soldier.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! Then you saw her, eh? I begin to see how you broke the pitcher, my boy!
                  That wash-stand is a very convenient stepladder to help one to look through the
                  window over the door. Ah, ha, my boy, that's the way! Well, you didn't hear
                     <emph>very</emph> good news, did you?"</p>
               <p>"Now quit bantering me, Ernest, and I'll let you alone!"</p>
               <p>"I will, if you'll confess the truth!"</p>
               <p>"What truth?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that you're over head and heels in love with Lizzie Laurel!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, Ernest, you don't know what you are talking about!"</p>
               <p>"Yes I do; and you don't dare to deny the 'soft impeachment' either!"</p>
               <p>Hilton made no reply, but hurried to dress himself, as a smoking hot breakfast,
                  with 'plates for two,' was brought in at that moment by a waiter.</p>
               <p>About an hour later, a very well dressed gentleman was escorting a young lady, who
                  was not only well dressed, but very handsome. The young gentleman made no
                  pretensions to good looks, but out of <emph>respect</emph> for the lady, probably,
                  he had dressed himself with most unauthorlike authorlike care and neatness. I need
                  not inform the reader that one was La Belle Serena, the other Ernest Cramer.</p>
               <p>As they walked on, the lady, better acquainted in the locality than Cramer,
                  pointed out various of the princely dwellings, and named those who resided in
                  them, giving, in many cases, their histories, with a freedom which would not have
                  been pleasantly flattering to the subjects, had they been present to hear
                  them.</p>
               <p>"That building," she said, pointing to a showy edifice, fronting on University
                  Place, "was built by a retired pawnbroker. I never look at it but I think of the
                  tears and sighs of the widow and orphans, for from them the base,
                     <emph>legalised</emph> robbers filch their spoils. He has a coat of arms on his
                  coach-panel, but not a suitable one!"</p>
               <p>"It should be three balls!" suggested Cramer.</p>
               <p>"No, it should be the head of a Hyena, or a Vampire. But look at the house nearly
                  opposite, still more showy. It is owned by Mr. Smythe Klurk, a man that used to
                  drive a hack for a living. He married a woman, who was at the time a kitchen
                  drudge in the house where he boarded; but shortly after her marriage, an aunt of
                  hers, who was immensly wealthy, died, and she fell heir to all the property, no
                  other relative being alive. This <emph>elevated</emph> her in every way. She is
                  now at the head of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ton</foreign>. She has the best
                  seat in the opera, rides in the richest carriage in the city, and were you ever to
                  say <emph>kitchen</emph> to her, she would frown you out of existence. She
                  tortures French, can play four tunes on the piano, and is
                     <emph>accomplished</emph>. Oh, you ought to see her put on airs in company. It
                  would make you laugh outright, even if Lord <emph>Chesterfield</emph> was by, with
                  his rules of polite behavior in his hand!"</p>
               <p>"Whose house is this?" asked Cramer, as they turned a corner, and observed a house
                  built a little back from the street, and surrounded by an ornamental garden.</p>
               <p>"Ah, it is owned by a wealthy Englishman. He is an old bachelor—has no end to his
                  wealth. I have heard that he is worth eight or ten millions, and has not a
                  relative in this country!"</p>
               <p>"It is singular that he does not marry. Why does he have so large a house?"</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6961-00000053"/>
               <p>"There are many reports about him; but I never listen to them!"</p>
               <p>Ernest saw by the slight blush which gathered like sunlight on a lily over her
                  fair cheek, that delicacy which would not permit her to freely answer his
                  question, and he asked no more.</p>
               <p>Their walk, however, was of more interest to <emph>themselves</emph> than its
                  description will be to the reader; therefore, we will leave them, and turn to
                  another and far different scene: we will see how Judas Iscariot Arnold fares in
                  the mansion of "His Eminence."</p>
               <p>We left Judas Iscariot Arnold senseless in the apartments of "His Eminence," his
                  insensibility principally produced by the quantity and quality of the wine which
                  he had imbibed. No sooner had he fallen to the floor, than His Eminence, by a
                  sign, caused the dancers to disperse, and when they had retired, he bade the
                  servant remove the drunken man to bed.</p>
               <p>"To which room, your Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"The Blue, of course—he is a distinguished guest!" said the priest.</p>
               <p>"Shall I alter any thing? It was dressed for the reception of the Lady Angelique,
                  as your Eminence is aware. It has not been altered since she left!"</p>
               <p>A flush of crimson rose to the priest's brow as the servant said this. What could
                  cause it? Pleasant or unpleasant memories connected with her whose name had just
                  been mentioned? Be patient, perhaps we'll learn by and bye.</p>
               <p>"Nothing need be altered—let him see the full extent of our voluptuousness,"
                  replied the priest. He added in a low tone—"Such as he can be pleased and
                  corrupted most easily by things which appeal to the grosser passions. He is an
                  animal, after all, <emph>nothing</emph> but an <emph>animal!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The sun had risen ere Arnold awoke next morning. When he opened his eyes, the
                  light of day was stealing softly and rosily into the room through curtains of pink
                  lawn, which added a rich and mellow hue to the various objects which met his eye.
                  The furniture was of the richest kind. The walls, instead of being papered or
                  plastered, as chambers usually are, were hung with heavy drapery of blue velvet.
                  Along these, and in various parts of the room, were pieces of statuary so finished
                  as almost to resemble life itself. But these were of the most voluptuous cast.
                  Cupid and <choice>
                     <sic>Pysche</sic>
                     <corr>Psyche</corr>
                  </choice>; Susannah and the elders; Venus rising from the bath; Eve plucking the
                  apple from the tree of knowledge; Diana and Endymion; and other pieces of a like
                  character met his eye. A murmur of falling waters fell upon his ear, and as he
                  gazed toward the farther side of the room, he saw what appeared to be a garden of
                  shadowy bowers, and amid a field of roses, a bright and sparkling fountain threw
                  its glittering spray up from a marble basin.</p>
               <p>"Is this real, or am I still dreaming?" he muttered to himself, pressing his hot
                  brow with both hands.</p>
               <p>But the noise of the dashing water, and a desire to cool his dry and burning lips,
                  made him rise, and when he had passed across a carpet so soft that it yielded no
                  sound to his heavy step, he found that the arbors were paintings upon a wall in an
                  alcove of the room, and that the fountain was a marble bath, surrounded by large
                  pots of roses and other flowers. Soap, towels, and other conveniences of the
                  toilet were lying on a table near, and on a broad sofa of crimson velvet, lay a
                  snow white flannel bathing gown, and a dressing gown of cassimere.</p>
               <p>The man looked around him in pleased astonishment. "This <emph>is</emph> living
                  like a prince," he muttered.</p>
               <p>Then, without more ado, he betook himself to the bath, which he found to be of
                  temperate heat, and after a little while he came forth renewed in his feelings,
                  with scarce a vestige of the headache left. As he paused at the toilet table to
                  arrange his hair, he found, that even the headache had been provided against, for
                  a bottle of hock stood there in an ice-pail, and with a label attached, reading
                  thus: "<hi rend="i"/>Hock and Soda, according to Byron, is an infallible cure for
                  the headache. Vide Don Juan."</p>
               <p>He smiled as he read this, and took the medicine. He then dressed, and wandered
                  around the room from statue to statue, admiring the lovely but too voluptuous
                  figures, but startled on hearing the door<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6961-00000054"
                  /> open, he turned and beheld the servant who had waited upon the priest and
                  himself the night before.</p>
               <p>"If your Excellency pleases, his Eminence awaits you at breakfast," said the
                  man.</p>
               <p>"My Excellency? Jove, but honors come apace in this service!" muttered Arnold to
                  himself, adding, to the servant in a louder tone—</p>
               <p>I am ready—I will follow you to the presence of his Eminence!"</p>
               <p>In a moment after he was ushered into a small room, where his Eminence was seated
                  beside a marble centre-table, engaged in reading a morning paper. He bore no mark
                  of the previous evening's debauch—looked as calm and serene as if he had never
                  tasted wine, except in the sacramental cup; as if his mind had never descended to
                  plot mischief, mingle in earthly scenes and passions, or for a moment forgotten
                  the high calling indicated by his priestly garb.</p>
               <p>"I hope you rested well!" said he to Arnold, as the latter entered the room.</p>
               <p>"I only awoke a short time since, and slept in a land of dreams Shakspeare says
                  that 'dreams murder sleep,'. but I'm <emph>willing</emph> to have my sleep
                  murdered if it could always be slain by such sweet visions!"</p>
               <p>"Pray what were your dreams?" asked the priest.</p>
               <p>"I dreamed that I was in Paradise with the beautiful houris of a Mahomedan Heaven
                  dancing in celestial loveliness around me, each only striving to win me for her
                  own—it was indeed a heaven!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven is seen mostly in dreams!" said the priest, with a sarcastic smile. Then
                  turning to the servant, he added: "Dennis, bring in breakfast—I breakfast rather
                  earlier than usual. I expect company soon!"</p>
               <p>"A hint for me to get through soon and travel," thought Arnold.</p>
               <p>The table was soon covered with a slender but choice repast, and almost in silence
                  the two broke their fast. After they were through, his Eminence gave Arnold a few
                  more instructions regarding his actions and further interviews, and enjoining
                  secrecy as to what he had seen and heard, upon him, dismissed him.</p>
               <p>After he had departed, the priest turned to Dennis and asked.</p>
               <p>"Is any one waiting an audience?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence. An Italian name, Corvi del Onda!"</p>
               <p>"Remove the fragments, then bid him come in!"</p>
               <p>In a short time, a swarthy looking lean figured man was introduced into the room,
                  who knelt before the priest, and as he kissed the skirt of his black robe, asked
                  his blessing.</p>
               <p>With calm dignity, the priest blessed him, and bade him rise.</p>
               <p>"You sent for me, Eminence!" said the man, bowing his head numbly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Corvi! The Church has need of you!"</p>
               <p>The Italian made the sign of the cross on his breast, and reverently said—"Her
                  will be done, for I am hers, soul and body!"</p>
               <p>"You are a faithful servant, Corvi," continued the priest—"I have marked your
                  devotion, and it shall not go unrewarded!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, you are too kind to him who is not worthy to kiss your feet!"</p>
               <p>"How stands your daughter, the beautiful Desca, toward the Church?"</p>
               <p>The Italian started at the name, and looking at the priest with a keen, wondering
                  gaze, murmured, too low to be heard by him—"Not her—not her: she is my only child:
                  a wife was enough to give to the cause!"</p>
               <p>"I did not understand you, Corvi! How does Desca stand affected in this land of
                  heresies and temptation?" said the priest, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"She is a good Catholic, Eminence. She tells her rosary each morn and eve, and
                  prays often to the Holy Virgin!"</p>
               <p>"That is well. I have a work for her. The Church needs her services!"</p>
               <p>A look of agony passed over the features of the Italian, and he murmured louder
                  than before, "Eminence, she is my <emph>only child!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The priest smiled sarcastically, and replied: "Art not thou sworn to yield
                  thyself, and all that is thine, to the Church?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence; but forgive me; I <emph>love</emph> my daughter!"</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6961-00000055"/>
               <p>"That's right; no harm will befal her. I intend only that she shall be an
                  attendant, or companion, to a widow lady, who will arrive here from the South in a
                  few days, and whom I wish watched!"</p>
               <p>"Desca will make but a poor spy, Eminence. She is as guileless and all as
                  unsuspecting as an infant!"</p>
               <p>"So much the better. I do not intend that she shall know for what she is employed:
                  when she is unsuspecting, she will be unsuspected!" replied the priest.</p>
               <p>"Can no harm befal her, Eminence?" asked the man hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"None; she will be under my own supervision. The lady is a daughter of the Church;
                  but she is very wealthy, and I fear she may make some improper match. I wish some
                  one near her who can let us know who visits her, or whether she forms any
                  attachment!"</p>
               <p>"My daughter is at your service, Eminence," said the man with a sigh. "When will
                  she be wanted?"</p>
               <p>"I will let you know on the morrow. Here is a purse containing one hundred
                  dollars. Get her a neat, genteel wardrobe at once!"</p>
               <p>The priest waved his hand for the man to retire.</p>
               <p>The servant came in again in a few minutes' and said: "A lady waits below,
                  Eminence!"</p>
               <p>"Her name?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Laurel, Eminence!"</p>
               <p>"Shew her hither: yes, I sent for her!"</p>
               <p>When the lady, a fine looking, middle-aged woman, appeared, she bent a knee to the
                  floor, and murmured: "Your blessing, holy Eminence!"</p>
               <p>Again, with that bland and serene dignity which I have so often alluded to, the
                  hypocrite invoked the blessing of Almighty God on the kneeling woman; then with a
                  gentle kindness he raised her, and bade her be seated.</p>
               <p>"I sent for you, fair sister," said he in a kind tone, "to inquire if you have
                  room for a boarder, whom I daily expect in the city?"</p>
               <p>"I would make room, Eminence,—I would manage to offend one of my present boarders,
                  to make room for one of your Eminence's recommendation! I have one who has often
                  offended <emph>me</emph>, by his slanders against our Holy Church. I mean to get
                  rid of him soon!"</p>
               <p>"You mean Ernest Cramer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence!"</p>
               <p>"You must do nothing to offend him; I wish him to remain where he is. Yes, you
                  must use every inducement to make him remain!"</p>
               <p>"But, Eminence, I have discovered that my daughter is in love with him: she is
                  young and foolish—of a warm and ardent nature, and—"</p>
               <p>"You fear for her virtue!" said the priest, seeing that she hesitated to speak
                  what she meant.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence."</p>
               <p>"Then fear not. Heretic though he is, and an enemy to our Church, he has a sense
                  of honor that will prevent him from doing harm to an innocent maiden. Your
                  daughter is handsome, I believe!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Very</emph> beautiful, though <emph>I</emph>No, she is a rich Southern
                  widow. She comes North to look for a husband, I think; but this must not be spoken
                  by you. I have been written to by a friend to get her a genteel boarding-house,
                  and have thought it best to recommend you!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Eminence, you are too gracious! Is the lady a Catholic?"</p>
               <p>"She is a daughter of the true Church! You will prepare for her; but remember you
                  must not disturb Cramer. I have plans for his <emph>conversion</emph>, which must
                  not be crossed!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, I obey your will in all things!"</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6961-00000056"/>
               <p>"<emph>All?</emph>" murmured the priest in a low whisper—so low that she could not
                  hear it, and a licentious look gathered in his countenance' as he gazed upon the
                  full proportions of a form which thirty-five summers had served rather to ripen
                  than to injure. "<emph>All?</emph>" he whispered, as he saw a blush mantle her
                  comely features when she met his warm gaze. "<emph>All?</emph>" he whispered, as
                  he saw her fine form tremble slightly, and her full bosom beat quicker beneath
                  that gaze.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>IT was night again. A large hall, or room, capable of containing at least four or
                  five hundred people, was draped in solemn black. On a table covered with black
                  serge lay paper and writing materials. On each side of this long table were placed
                  twelve arm-chairs, and each one was cushioned with black. At the head of the table
                  was a kind of dais, or raised throne; it also being draped in black. Everything in
                  the room wore the same chilling, death-like color. Not a soul is in it; it seems
                  cold, solemn, gloomy, like some home of the ghostly dead. This, reader, is a room
                  where more vile plotting is going on each week than Americans would endure, if
                  they were only awakened to it. It is known to the Jesuits as <q>
                     <p>The Hall of the Convocation of the Twenty-four Elders.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here once each week—oftener, if by special order of the Jesuit Chief or General,
                  meet the "Twenty-four Elders," as they are termed,—a chosen body of Jesuit
                  priests, whom the Chief advises with, and who have charge of different departments
                  in the interest of the Order. The room, I said a moment ago, was vacant. Hark! you
                  hear a slow and measured tramp, which keeps solemn time to a deep swelling chaunt
                  of human voices. A door at the lower end of the room opens, and at the head of two
                  ranks of priests appears "His Eminence," <emph>he</emph> bearing a small black
                  crucifix in his hand—each of the others carrying a candle placed in an ebony
                  candlestick. As they approach the table, continuing the chaunt, they separate, one
                  rank to the right, the other to the left, till each is opposite his chair. Then,
                  as his Eminence mounts the throne, each takes his chair, placing the candle before
                  him. The door has been closed behind them; the chaunt is still—though twenty-five
                  human beings are<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6961-00000057"/> there, you can
                  scarcely hear a breath. But the silence is broken. The <emph>man</emph> whom we
                  know as "His Eminence," rises, and reaching out the black crucifix over their
                  heads, says in a deep, sonorous voice:</p>
               <p>"Brothers and elders of the secret Order of Jesus, we will pray for the success of
                  the cause!"</p>
               <p>Then in the same deep and solemn voice, raising the ebon crucifix high toward
                  Heaven—he prayed:</p>
               <p>"Hear us, Triune God! Hear us, Blessed Virgin! Hear us, Michael, Archangel of
                  Heaven! Hear us, Holy Apostles, and all ye Saints and Martyrs! Bless ye our
                  Order—spread ye our light till we illuminate the earth. Crush our enemies—aid us,
                  make us wise and all powerful, that we may attain the end which is the good of the
                  Church! Amen!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!" rolled in a deep murmur, like a wave in a sea-girt cavern, from every lip
                  in that tomb-like room. Then his Eminence continued:</p>
               <p>"Brothers and elders, we pronounce the Holy Convocation of twenty-four elders in
                  session. Each in turn will make his report, and then we will consider other
                  matters!"</p>
               <p>The first man on his right arose, and making the sign of the cross, ere he spoke,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Eminence—the cause is progressing. In the district confided to my care, we have
                  complete control of the education of the children. We have got our own teachers in
                  the Public Schools, and my congregation are under good discipline! Praised be the
                  Lord. Amen!"</p>
               <p>"Amen," rolled solemnly through the echoing room from lip to lip, as the speaker
                  seated himself.</p>
               <p>The next arose.</p>
               <p>"Eminence," said he—"the labor in my field is hard. My district, as your Eminence
                  is aware, is in the Eleventh Ward, and the secret societies of Americans there
                  have numerous branches and many adherents. And their addresses and books and
                  certain other movements, tend much to retard the action of those who are devoted
                  to the good cause. We must do something to crush <emph>them</emph>, or they will
                  crush us! They mock our ceremonies, ridicule our pretensions, falsify our
                  statements. They are united, they aid each other, and oppose us. They weaken our
                  power, for they make converts from our ranks. May God and all the Saints and
                  Martyrs crush them. Amen!"</p>
               <p>"Amen," rolled again like an echo through the room.</p>
               <p>Thus each of these elders told his tale, all pretty much upon the same point and
                  having a similar bearing. Then his Eminence, who had listened attentively, arose
                  and said:</p>
               <p>"Brothers and elders, we have listened to the reports, and while pleased with
                  some, have been pained with others. We commend to you to be more vigilant and
                  active. Remember the principle that '<emph>the end justifies the means</emph>,'
                  and let no opportunity escape you. Brother Ignatius in his report, spoke truly,
                  that the advancement of our cause is retarded by these INFAMOUS SECRET SOCIETIES
                  OF AMERICANS, men who are opposed to our religion, who by some fatal mischance,
                  have discovered our intentions to build up an empire of the Church in this vast
                  and resourceful country, and who will use every effort to thwart our aims. Brother
                  Ignatius spoke truly when he said they <emph>must</emph> be crushed, or
                     <emph>we</emph> shall be! We are taking means to crush them. And the way to do
                  it, is to bring them into disrepute. One who is most active amongst them, whose
                  whole heart, soul and body seem devoted to the advancement of their order, and the
                  spread of their principles, is at this moment under my eye, and we are spreading
                  the net which shall ensnare him. If it succeeds, and it cannot <emph>fail</emph>,
                  we will strike a blow which shall penetrate the very <emph>heart</emph> of that
                  Order!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!" arose again, in that solemn echo which rolled from wall to wall of the
                  black-draperied room. The priest spoke on.</p>
               <p>"Yes, foremost in the ranks of that order, I find a young man possessed of more
                  talent than prudence, whose heart is enwrapped in its advancement. He has many
                  friends, but in a <emph>general</emph> wish for reform, he has not alone attacked
                  us, but has divided his efforts against the social vices of the day. This lessens
                  his strength, and adds to the number of his enemies. Were he battling against us
                  alone, we might have double reason to fear him. But his pen is<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000058"/> directed against not only the thieves and gamblers,
                  but against those who, seated in high office, fail to fulfil their duties. He has
                  raised and is raising enemies by this; and from these, and with these we must
                  crush him. Our plans are laid. We do not hold the office of General of the Order
                  of Jesus, in the western world, as a sinecure place. No—when we accepted it, we
                  weighed our responsibilities well, and considered our labors. And we will fulfil
                  our high duties to the latter, by the help of God and his holy Angels."</p>
               <p>"Amen!" arose from every lip.</p>
               <p>"Brothers," continued his Eminence, "next week our plans shall be laid before you.
                  We shall then ask your advice and counsel further. If ye have gifts for our
                  Treasury, ye will now produce them!"</p>
               <p>A bustle amongst the priests ensued, and soon before each one was laid a pile of
                  money of all kinds. Coppers, sixpences, shillings, quarters, gold pieces and bank
                  bills, were laid out, just as in the "Poor Boxes" and <emph>other</emph> manners
                  of contribution, it had been received.</p>
               <p>When this was done, "His Eminence" pronounced a benediction in Latin, and then
                  resuming the chaunt with which they entered, they all arose and left the room.</p>

               <p>HARRY HILTON-dined with Ernest Cramer on the same day that the latter took the
                  morning walk with "La Belle Serena."</p>
               <p>"I think," said he, as he lighted his cigar after dinner, "that I might as well
                  take up my quarters here altogether, Ernest! I spend more than two-thirds of my
                  time with you!"</p>
               <p>"I wish you would, Harry. I would gladly share my apartments with you, and feel
                  amply rewarded by the pleasure of your society."</p>
               <p>"Are you serious, Ernest?"</p>
               <p>"I seldom say anything which I do not mean," replied Cramer. "And to convince you,
                  let me send for your baggage at the hotel, and instal you regularly here!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Ernest, really I—"</p>
               <p>"Poh! No excuses, my friend; I want you to come. I want you to pay a visit with me
                  to-night!"</p>
               <p>"Where? To Japonica Place?"</p>
               <p>"No, to another of the sinks of infamy which disgrace this city. I wish to gather
                  items for a new series of articles with which I hope to arouse the attention of
                  the people to the evils I allude to!"</p>
               <p>"I'm with you, Harry. I like the excitement and adventure attendant upon these
                  researches of yours!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Again the shades of evening had mantled our great city. The long rows of
                  street-lamps were lighted, and from these and many an uncurtained window came
                  light enough to render walking quite as pleasant as it would be by day. The hour
                  was early—not later than nine, when Cramer and Hilton, both wrapped in cloaks,
                  with fur caps drawn well down on their heads, entered Broadway. As usual, at this
                  hour, a perfect stream of various humanity was eddying along its<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000059"/> broad channel—a mixture of all kinds. The man of
                  business hurrying homeward; the stranger sauntering along; the courtezan on the
                  tramp for victims; the thief and the beggar, each jostling the other.</p>
               <p>"We'll see the Broadway sights for an hour or so; it is too early yet to visit the
                  place that I intended to go to to-night!" said Cramer, as Hilton locked arms with
                  him, so that they should not be separated. "And first," he continued, "let's go
                  down here. This saloon is the gamblers' head-quarters!"</p>
               <p>As he said this, Ernest entered a saloon, which displayed on its sign the name of
                  — —'s Restaurant. It also notified the visitor that there were private rooms for
                  gentlemen <emph>and</emph> ladies, back, where they could be supplied with
                  oysters, wine, game, and all the delicacies of the season. Passing down the steps,
                  (for it was in a basement,) they at once found themselves in a long and elegant
                  saloon, lined on one side with curtained stalls, and fronted on the other with a
                  long bar, upon either end of which stood a glittering array of decanters filled
                  with wines, brandies and <emph>liquers</emph> of all kinds. Four white aproned
                  bar-keepers, and at least a dozen waiters in the saloon, would have signified that
                  they did <emph>some</emph> business, but the ringing of bells, the clatter of
                  plates in the little stalls, the calls for "waiter," and above all, the forty or
                  fifty "members" at the bar, indicated that they did a very large business. Hilton
                  and Cramer slipped quietly into one of the stalls, where they could observe the
                  visitors without being noticed themselves, and calling for some stewed oysters,
                  &amp;c., prepared to spend a half hour or so in inspecting the fashions there.</p>
               <p>They had not been seated long, when Hilton, in a low tone, called Cramer's
                  attention to Manton, who, with three or four others, had just entered.</p>
               <p>"Yes—and he has some new victim in tow!" said Cramer. "That man is a stranger in
                  the city. He has a Westernish look, and probably is what the gamblers would term a
                  fat pigeon, for he wears jewelry enough to stock a show-case in Tenney's, almost.
                  Look, there are three of the sharks around him. Manton calls for champagne,
                  too—he'll spend his money freely only when he is sure of a harvest to repay
                  it.'</p>
               <p>"By the man that invented powder, I <emph>know</emph> that man!" said Hilton.
                  "Ernest, keep easy, you'll see the biters bit. I know that man, sure! When I first
                  glanced at him his face seemed familiar, and now I'm confident that it is
                     <emph>he!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Who?"</p>
               <p>"Thad Maynard, a Texan gambler and fighting man, who followed the army all through
                  Mexico. He did considerable fighting on <emph>private</emph> account—was death on
                  the greasers, and whenever we camped he was sure to have a faro and monte bank in
                  the neighborhood. That is him; and I'll stake my existence that Manton and his
                  gang get skinned alive to-night!"</p>
               <p>"I'd like to see it done!"</p>
               <p>"So would I, Ernest. Suppose we return to your room, and you again become Senor
                  D'Albro—we then can follow, or join them!"</p>
               <p>"Agreed, but we must wait till they leave, for you would be recognised by Manton,
                  and I don't wish you to be seen by him, until I'm rigged in my disguise!"</p>
               <p>"But we may miss them? How can we find where they go when they leave here?"</p>
               <p>"Hark—Manton is proposing something. There it is, they are going up to the
                  WIDOW's, to show their <emph>friend</emph> the fashions in the upstair drinking
                  hells. I wonder what name he goes by—he is evidently playing the
                     <emph>green-horn</emph>. See how he carries it out—he is good at the
                  cards?"</p>
               <p>"He skinned everybody that played with him, and only let his favorites win!"</p>
               <p>"There they go—come, Harry—to my room to dress, and then we'll follow them and see
                  it out!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was half an hour later. Hilton and Cramer, or rather Senor D'Albro, for he had
                  assumed his disguise, entered a house in Broadway, not far from Canal street. They
                  entered without ringing a bell or knocking, though the genteel-looking door-plate
                  would have signified that this was a private residence. They passed along a
                  narrow, dimly lighted hall, and up a pair of stairs in the rear, both hall<pb
                     n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6961-00000060"/> and stairs carpeted thickly, so that
                  their footsteps made no noise They turned to the right on reaching the head of the
                  stairs, and entered a room which was glittering with the light of a large
                  chandelier reflected from numerous mirrors and pictures. Though the back windows
                  would not have opened to any thing except the dead wall of a manufactory, they
                  were closely shuttered and curtained with heavy damask. The large room was
                  furnished with extravagant elegance. Sofas, chairs and tables of the richest
                  material, were carelessly arranged around; and in one corner, a neat bar, covered
                  with decanters and their sparkling contents, was visible. Behind this stood a
                  woman, dressed very handsomely in half mourning. She was stately, stoutish in
                  figure, but not ungraceful, and her features were fine, though not expressive
                  either of gentleness or purity. Her color was too high for Nature, and to a close
                  observer, there were man little signs to show that her beauty was more artificial
                  than natural Her age, therefore, would not be easily guessed at. She was at
                     <unclear>least</unclear> forty, and might come in under the head of the
                  beauties described as "fat, fair and forty." She was busily engaged in mixing
                  sundry drink on scientific principles; and, as each glass was filled, she placed
                  it upon a salver held by a pale, delicate, but not unhandsome creature a little
                  girl who could not be over thirteen years of age. <emph>She</emph>
                  <unclear>looked</unclear> sad and sorrowful; and when the woman said,</p>
               <p>"Sis, take them in to the gentlemen in the front parlor," she moved along
                  mechanically, sighing as she went. She did not even turn her head when Cramer and
                  Hilton entered, but "the Widow's" bright eyes were more attentive, and she smiled
                  blandly when she saw Hilton's bright buttons.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome, gentlemen!" said she—"of the army, I presume?"</p>
               <p>"I am, but my friend is a Spaniard," replied Hilton.</p>
               <p>"Ah, a Spanish gentleman? I do so <emph>love</emph> the cavaliers of that nation!
                  Does your friend understand English?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, partially, and speaks it a little, but imperfectly. We will take a glass of
                  wine, if you please, <emph>Mrs. Parsons!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why, sir, you <emph>know</emph> me?" said the lady, as she turned and reached her
                  plump hand, glittering with jewels, for a decanter.</p>
               <p>"Who that '<hi rend="i"/>travels' does not know you, madam? I have heard of your
                  beauty, and the elegance of your saloon, and wished to see for myself."</p>
               <p>"Ah, sir, you are a flatterer!" said the widow, vainly trying to blush through the
                  paint. "Which wine do you prefer—here is some fine old port—there some
                  sherry."</p>
               <p>"Port, if you please," said Hilton.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said the pale, sorrowful-looking girl, "the gentlemen in the front room
                  want cigars."</p>
               <p>Was it possible? Could a mother be so heartless as to rear up a young girl in the
                  polluted air of a fashionable saloon—to rear her up in her young beauty, under the
                  eyes of rakes and libertines—to expose her to temptation, insult, ruin, and
                  infamy? To expose her at that tender age to all this? Could she not see how the
                  fumes of tobacco smoke, the reeking atmosphere of liquor, the late hours, and
                  unnatural labor, were killing that poor child? Could not that pale, meek face, and
                  those low, pleading sighs, make her <emph>feel</emph> for her child?</p>
               <p>So <emph>thought</emph> Ernest Cramer, as he gazed upon her, and pitied her. A
                  hearty laugh from the front parlor was heard now, and the young men recognised the
                  voice of Manton. The door being half open, they entered, requesting the widow to
                  send in the wine to them.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lieut. Hilton, and Senor D'Albro! Delighted to see you, gentlemen! Let me
                  introduce my friend, Mr. Billings, from Kentucky, gentlemen!" cried Manton, as he
                  saw them.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. <emph>Billings?</emph>" said Hilton, with a glance at Maynard,
                  which told him that his secret was safe. "Old Kentuck is a great State."</p>
               <p>"It's the snortinest State in the hull Union for fast horses, purty girls, and
                  sharp rifle shootin'," responded Thad Maynard, <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >alias</foreign> Mr. <emph>Billings</emph>.</p>
               <p>"You may well say that last. I saw some of their practice in Mexico—"</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6961-00000061"/>
               <p>"What! 've you been to Mexico a fightin' of the greasers? Did you ever meet my
                  son, <emph>Thad,</emph> out there?"</p>
               <p>"I can't say that I remember meeting any one of the name of Billings out
                  there."</p>
               <p>"Wall, that's queerious! He was <emph>thar,</emph> sure, and I know it by this
                  token. I gin him a drove o' horses to speculate on; he sold the horses, and two of
                  my best niggers, and deposited the money in one of their cussed banks, the Bank of
                     <hi rend="i"/>Monte, I think he told me, and I've never seen hide or hair of it
                  since."</p>
               <p>"That was a bad look-out," said Manton, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I'm done with banks ever since. <emph>Thar's</emph> the bank I trust
                  in!" replied the quondam Kentuckian, drawing a large black pocket-book, apparently
                  well filled, from his pocket.</p>
               <p>"I expect the bank your son put his money in was somewhat similar to one or two
                  banks in our city. We had a bank of <emph>Moses,</emph> but it failed: but then
                  there is still a <emph>Pharaoh</emph> Bank here."</p>
               <p>"What queerious names! I suppose Church folks owns 'em?" said the <emph>verdant
                     Westerner</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Manton, "Quakers and Latter-day Saints. By the way, do the Church
                  folks out your way ever read the history of the Four Kings,?"</p>
               <p>"What's <emph>that?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Billings, is it possible that you are a <emph>Kentuckian,</emph> and
                  don't know <emph>that?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I don't know it by that name, at any rate!"</p>
               <p>"Do you know what <emph>old sledge</emph> is?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, I reckon yes. And I know what <hi rend="i"/>loo is, and eucher, too. I can
                  play old sledge as well as any other he, except old Smith, and I mean to try
                     <emph>him</emph> some time for a few."</p>
               <p>"We never play <emph>much</emph> here, but suppose we get up a little game here to
                  amuse ourselves for an hour or two?' said Manton.</p>
               <p>"Wall, I'm agreeable, ef you don't go mor'n a half, ante, for I'm no hand to
                  gamble."</p>
               <p>"Neither am I," said Manton; "but I must see the widow, to see if she has
                  cards."</p>
               <p>As he said this, he went out into the other room, not for cards, for he had a
                     <emph>marked</emph> pack in his pocket, but to tell the widow to close her door
                  down stairs, so that no other visitors would come in to interrupt them.</p>
               <p>"I've got a pigeon in there, green as grass and fat as butter," said he to the
                  widow.</p>
               <p>"Skin that shark alive, Thad," whispered Hilton to Maynard. "I'll back you—you're
                  safe."</p>
               <p>The Texan gambler only smiled; and <emph>such</emph> a smile, as the barkeeper
                  said, when a customer drank a tumblerfull of fourth-proof without winking.</p>
               <p>"You'll join us, won't you, gentlemen?" asked Manton of Hilton, D'Albro, and the
                  rest, as he returned with a pack of cards in his hand.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me and my friend!" said Hilton. "We will look on for a little while."</p>
               <p>"But we want a <emph>four-handed</emph> game!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps some of those other gentlemen will play?" suggested Hilton.</p>
               <p>One of them volunteered; the others, obedient to a hint given in a look by Manton,
                  declined.</p>
               <p>"You must; now <emph>do</emph>, Lieutenant. You see, we are only three!"</p>
               <p>"Yaas, stranger, come in; I'll take you for a partner: you look sharp as a
                  steel-trap. I guess we can make the liquors out o' <emph>them!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well, but I warn you I am no player!" said Hilton, taking the seat.</p>
               <p>"Then it's only fair you give me the first deal!" said <emph>Billings</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Of course!" said Manton, handing the cards to him.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>purty</emph> cards these be!" said Billings, examining them very
                  closely, and shuffling them very awkwardly. As he looked and recognised marks
                  which he knew, a quiet smile gathered on his face. The pack was shuffled, cut and
                  dealt. The trump turned up, and behold it was a <emph>Jack!</emph>
               </p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6961-00000062"/>
               <p>"Hooray for our side! There's <emph>one</emph> counted a'ready!" cried
                  Billings.</p>
               <p>"We've forgotten to put up our money!" said Manton quietly.</p>
               <p>"So we have—thar's my half!" replied Maynard, heaving down a bright half
                  dollar.</p>
               <p>"Let's make the stake a V," said Manton.</p>
               <p>"What! No; that would be gamblin', and I'm <emph>opposed</emph> to gamblin'!" said
                  Billings.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! What is a <emph>five</emph> to men of means!"</p>
               <p>"Well, a V. let it be! Our side 'll win sure!" said the Texan, drawing out that
                     <emph>fat</emph> pocket-book and opening it slowly, so that every one could see
                  how full it was. And the bills in it were not small, either. In truth, on
                  examining it, the "<emph>green</emph> 'un" found he had nothing under a fifty.
                  This, however, the "widow" very kindly consented to change, and the game went on.
                  The hand was played, and the "<emph>green 'un's</emph>" won high, low, game,
                  counting four on the start.</p>
               <p>It then became Manton's turn to deal. He, too, turned up a <emph>Jack!</emph>
                  Hilton, who, seated next to him, had the word, now "begged," to use a phrase of
                  the game. Manton had a splendid "hand"; he was sure, as he thought, of making
                     <emph>four:</emph> for he had the king, tray, queen and ten of trumps.</p>
               <p>"I give you one!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Hooray for our side!" shouted Maynard. I told you <emph>we'd</emph> win. Here's
                  high and low," (throwing down the ace and deuce,) "and that, with the
                     <emph>gift</emph>, and four before, puts us out. Stranger, take up your
                     <emph>ten</emph>, and here is <emph>mine!</emph>" suiting his action to the
                  word.</p>
               <p>"Hadn't you better leave the money down. We'll double the stakes!" said Manton,
                  smiling, as if he cared nothing about it.</p>
               <p>"I don't like it, for it looks like gamblin', and I'm <emph>opposed</emph> to
                  gamblin'; but if you <emph>insist</emph> on it, 'spose I <emph>can</emph> do it
                     <emph>once</emph> more—once <emph>only!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Hilton now had the deal, and not understanding the trick of turning up a
                     <emph>jack</emph>, didn't follow the example of his predecessor. And had it not
                  been for the "<emph>knowledge</emph>" of Maynard, they would have lost the game,
                  for the hand was altogether "a chance" one. Now Manton had several good cards
                  stowed away for <emph>use</emph>, but Maynard had also laid in a supply, and
                  managed to play "high" and save "game." The other side were "low" and jack.
                  Manton's partner next had a deal, and of course, <emph>he</emph> turned a
                     <emph>jack</emph>. This game, in spite of Maynard's play, resulted in favor of
                  Manton.</p>
               <p>"Let's play poker, that's a better game than this!" said the Kentuckian,
                  apparently a good deal put out by his loss.</p>
               <p>"I don't know how to play it!" said Hilton.</p>
               <p>"Then let it be two-handed. I want to win my money back from you, old hoss!" cried
                  Maynard, looking at Manton.</p>
               <p>"You'll have a chance, I'm agreed!" said Manton, smiling again, for now he thought
                  the game was all in his own hands.</p>
               <p>Cramer and Hilton now watched "dog fight dog," with eager intensity, as also did
                  the others.</p>
               <p>In a little while Manton found that if his Kentucky friend was <emph>green</emph>
                  in some things, he wasn't green at the game of poker; and to his utter
                  astonishment, after playing about an hour, he was forced to stop. He had lost
                     <emph>one thousand</emph> dollars, and had no more with him. The widow
                  proffered a loan, but he would not accept it, saying that he was in bad luck, and
                  couldn't play any more at that game.</p>
               <p>"I'm opposed to gamblin', but this 'ere looks darnedly like it!" said Mr.
                  Billings, putting his winnings into his pocket. I never won so much before, in all
                  my born days!"</p>
               <p>"You're in such luck, you ought to try a heavier game," said Manton. "Suppose you
                  try <emph>faro:</emph> I know a man that has a $10,000 game up; and if your luck
                  keeps up, you can win all that, too!"</p>
               <p>"Thunder! you don't say so? Whar is he? I'm in for it now; and though I'm opposed
                  to gamblin', I'd like to make that ten thousand on top o' this!" cried the
                  Kentuckian.</p>
               <p>"Let's adjourn, then, to his place. It isn't late. Widow, we'll take a bottle of
                  champagne before we start!"</p>

               <p>The time—a week later. The scene—a private parlor in the Astor<pb n="122-123"

                  becoming a wife, a kind of bashful struggle in <emph>appearance</emph>, between a
                  wish to remember the dead, and a wish to again assume the snowy robes of a bride.
                  She looked lady-like and well. Her dark eyes, fringed with ebon lashes, glossy and
                  fine as the unwoven thread of the filmy cocoon, were looking dreamily toward
                  DESCA, who, with her hands crossed over her palpitating bosom, stood before her.
                  Desca had just entered, having been sent by her father to become the companion and
                  maid of "<hi rend="i"/>Mrs. Montrose," who was represented as a widow from
                  Mississippi, of immense wealth, who sought a change of climate and society in the
                  north. As she had letters to a "Catholic Gentleman" of <emph>Eminence</emph> in
                  the city, immediately upon her arrival from the south, at the Astor, he was sent
                  for at her request, by the gentlemanly proprietors—and a story was told about the
                  "rascally abolitionists," enticing away her two slaves whom she had brought north
                  with her. Upon receiving this information, the Catholic gentleman at once offered
                  to procure her a maid, and hence the appearance in this connection of Desca, the
                  daughter of the Italian organ-grinder. The engraver, in the picture which
                  accompanies this chapter, has well illustrated the appearance of both at this
                  moment.</p>
               <p>"You are commended to me by a very worthy and pious man," said the "widow"
                  languidly, as she gazed at the beautiful young creature before her. "Do you think
                  you can live happily with me?"</p>
               <p>"Lady, you seem <emph>kind</emph>—if I can please you, I shall be happy,
                     <emph>much</emph> happier than I have been for years—happier than I have been
                  since I left dear Italy!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dear</emph> Italy!" sighed Gulietta, and her lips quivered with the
                  words.</p>
               <p>For a moment she was silent, then raising her dark eyes to those of Desca, she
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I also am an Italian! When I am weary and tired you will sing me to sleep with
                  one of the songs of our native land, will you not?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, lady! I love to sing, and above all, to sing the airs of Italy!"</p>
               <p>"You are a good, sweet girl!" said she, whom we must now call Mrs. Montrose. And
                  again she sighed as if strange thoughts passed through her bosom as she looked at
                  Desca.</p>
               <p>"Is your mother alive, child?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Alas, I never knew her! My father says she died when I was a babe, but I can only
                  remember finding myself when I was old enough to walk, in the convent di Santa
                  Clara!"</p>
               <p>"Ah—in the convent di Santa Clara?" exclaimed the lady with a look of
                  astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, lady!" replied Desca, wondering to see her new mistress turn alternately red
                  and pale.</p>
               <p>"How did you come to leave that holy place?"</p>
               <p>"When I was about seven years of age my father took me away, and ever since, I've
                  wandered about the world with him, sometimes almost rich, and then again
                     <emph>very</emph> poor, <emph>very</emph> wretched!"</p>
               <p>"Poor Desca! Does thy father love thee much?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, lady—he has ever been kind to me as he could. All of his people love
                  me."</p>
               <p>"<emph>His</emph> people? Has he servants or associates?"</p>
               <p>"He has many men and women in his employment, lady. They hire their organs and
                  monkeys from him, and at night divide the proceeds of their day's collecting."</p>
               <p>"Do they make much?"</p>
               <p>"Sometimes a great deal, but very often nothing, when they have bad luck!"</p>
               <p>Poor Desca did not understand the whole reason of the difference in the luck of
                  the organ-grinders. She did not know that they were thieves as well as beggars,
                  for her father had concealed this secret from her. Yet, so it was; and nothing
                  from a silver spoon down to the one shoe kicked off by a playful baby, went amiss,
                  if they could lay a hand on it.</p>
               <p>The conversation was interrupted at this moment, by the entrance<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000064"/> of a servant, who approached the lady, and bowing
                  with that respect which <emph>wealth</emph>, real or supposed, always commands,
                  handed her a card.</p>
               <p>The blood rushed up to her very brow as she murmured, "Ah, his Eminence!" Then, in
                  a louder tone, she said, "Request the gentleman to walk up."</p>
               <p>In a few moments a firm, heavy step was heard, the door opened, and the Chief of
                  the Jesuits entered.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Eminence, I did not expect this honor, but you are most welcome."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, good daughter! When a child of the true Church visits our city, it is our
                  duty to aid and guard her," said the priest, taking a seat near her.</p>
               <p>When his eye fell upon the lovely form of Desca, a look of pleased surprise
                  flitted over his countenance, and a look of uneasiness gathered in the face of the
                  lady when she saw the licentious expression with which he glanced at her
                  beauty.</p>
               <p>"This, then, is the maid that I commended?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence. She has just arrived."</p>
               <p>"Are you pleased with her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, much. She seems a good child."</p>
               <p>"I am pleased to hear so, and hope that she may prove faithful and true. Art a
                  good Catholic, child?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, your Reverence," said Desca, making the sign of the cross: "it is the faith
                  of my father."</p>
               <p>"And dost thou love thy father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Reverence."</p>
               <p>"That is well—see that thou obeyest him in <emph>all</emph> things, and as thou so
                  doest, may God prosper thee!"</p>
               <p>There was a deep and marked meaning in the words of the priest as he said this,
                  and it did not pass unnoticed by the lady. She began from that moment to feel a
                  kind of jealousy toward poor Desca, for, knowing from sad experience, the
                  disposition and unscrupulous passions of the priest, she did not doubt but that
                  Desca was already marked upon his list of intended victims. This to her was
                  galling, for though she had herself ceased to be a favorite of the fickle priest,
                  yet once for a brief time she had reigned <emph>supreme</emph> in his harem of
                  beauties—had with fond folly thought that he <emph>loved</emph> her! And with
                  woman's everlasting constancy, though cast from his side, and used used only as a
                  tool to carry out his projects of ambition and revenge, she still loved him enough
                  to feel jealous of even an admiring glance bestowed by him on another, in her
                  presence.</p>
               <p>The priest marked her uneasiness, and changed the subject.</p>
               <p>"I have procured a most excellent boarding house for thee, daughter," said he,
                  "and made all the arrangements for removing you to it whenever you choose."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Eminence! You are indeed very kind. I will go immediately."</p>

               <p>"WHAT on earth are you laughing so heartily about?" asked Cramer of Hilton, who
                  was shaking the table whereon the former was writing.</p>
               <p>"I'm reading this sketch of yours—'The Biter Bit'—it is so true to life! Ha! ha!
                  I'm thinking of Maynard raking in Manton's money and saying, every time he won, in
                  his dry way—'Drat the thing, but I'm in luck! I'm teetotally <emph>opposed to
                     gamblin'</emph>, but ef gamblin' pays this 'ere way, I can't help playin',
                     <emph>ef</emph> it is against my own principles.' And then to see how he met
                  each trick of theirs—I could hardly keep from laughing right out. I guess Mr.
                  Manton won't 'pick up' another Kentuckian."</p>
               <p>"I reckon not," said Cramer; "he lost fourteen thousand dollars that night. Well,
                  I was glad to see it. If professed gamblers only gambled with and amongst each
                  other—if shark would eat shark and let other fish alone—it is but little care that
                  I'd take to oppose their movements. But it is because they are ever entrapping and
                  robbing the unwary, leading innocence astray, bringing destruction on the young
                  and promising, carrying desolation into the bosoms of happy families, that I war
                  with them."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Ernest. The little time I have spent with you convinces me more
                  and more of the tremendous evils you are trying to oppose. But changing the
                  subject, I've got to run down to the post-office. Can I do anything for you
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you please, Harry; there are three letters to mail; but don't be gone
                  long; it is now five o'clock, and you know at seven I have an address to deliver
                  to the Order, and you promised to go with me."</p>
               <p>"I will hurry back. I wouldn't miss going there on any account But La Belle
                  Serena, is not she to go? I thought you intended to invite her?"</p>
               <p>"So I did; but in preparing the address, I have borne down so hard on her native
                  land, and given John Bull so many left-handed compliments, that I fear I should
                  hurt her feelings if she should hear them."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps 'tis best. Bye-bye; I'll be back in half an hour."</p>
               <p>The soldier now put on his hat and cloak, and whistling a stave of some army
                  chorus, left the room.</p>
               <p>Cramer again resumed his writing, but was doomed to another interruption; for in a
                  few minutes his door opened, and Lizzie Laurel entered. She stepped so light, and
                  he was so much engaged, that he did not hear her, and with a mischievous look in
                  her eye, she advanced behind his chair, and peeped over his shoulder at what he
                  was writing. Her countenance was bright when she first glanced upon the paper—her
                  eye laughingly brilliant—but as she read a few lines, the color left her young
                  cheek, a tear gathered in either eye, and her bosom heaved as a lake-born lily in
                  a sudden storm.</p>
               <p>"He loves another—he loves another!" she sighed.</p>
               <p>He wrote on, not hearing or knowing that she was near. And her eye, though almost
                  blinded with tears, still followed his pen, and drank in every word he wrote. "He
                  is going to marry—he asks her hand, and tells her that his love is so deep, so
                  fervent, that his life will a blank without her. Oh! that those words were writ to
                  me!" sighed the girl to her own heart; and then, her feelings overcoming her, she
                  burst into a flood of tears, and would have fallen to the floor, had not Cramer,
                  startled by her sobs, turned in time to catch her in his arms.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Lizzie? Why do you weep so? speak, dear Lizzie, speak!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dear</emph> Lizzie?" sobbed the girl; "he said <emph>dear</emph> Lizzie,
                  but he <unclear>loves</unclear> another!"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Lizzie? Do not weep—has any one<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000066"/> wronged you? Tell me, for all that a brother would
                  do for a sister that will I do for you."</p>
               <p>"I have only wronged myself!" sobbed the girl. "Forgive me, Mr. Cramer, I have
                  read a part of that letter"—and she pointed to the table—"and you are going to
                  leave us—going to marry."</p>
               <p>Her sobs redoubled as she said this. Ernest felt as if he was in a
                     <emph>fix</emph> There she was, her head resting on his breast, her lovely face
                  bedewed with tears turned up towards his, her sobs shaking her delicate form as
                  the breeze shakes the rain-beaten flower—and—as he kissed away her tears—he called
                  her "<emph>dear</emph> Lizzie," and begged her to be calm.</p>
               <p>In a little while, as a crying babe is lulled upon the bosom of its mother, Lizzie
                  became more composed, and then blushing, she arose and took a chair close by
                  Ernest's side.</p>
               <p>"Lizzie," said he gravely, but kindly, "you have opened your heart to me this
                  evening and shown me a picture which I did not dream of. I had thought you too
                  young to love with a woman's love; I have ever looked upon you as a sweet little
                  pet of a girl, but never have I encouraged such a feeling as <emph>love</emph> in
                  your breast."</p>
               <p>"I know it, Mr. Cramer; I alone am to blame; you have lived with us so long, and I
                  have known you so well, I couldn't help loving you!"</p>
               <p>"Then, Lizzie, for your sake as well as for my own, it will be best for me to
                  leave here!"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, Mr. Cramer, please <emph>do not</emph>—at least until—until—" (her voice
                  hesitated and trembled as she spoke,) "you are married! Let me beg you to stay. I
                  will never act so foolishly again—never by word or look renew this scene."</p>
               <p>"And will you keep my secret, Lizzie? I may be refused by this lady."</p>
               <p>"I will keep your secret, Mr. Cramer!" she replied mournfully; "but the lady will
                  not refuse you—you will be—married, and I,—<emph>never</emph> shall. My mother is
                  a Catholic, as you know, and I, though she couldn't make a good one of me before,
                  will now turn Nun, become a Sister of Mercy, and—die."</p>
               <p>Cramer was astonished to hear that girl so young, speak in a firm tone so plainly
                  and unhesitatingly of her intended course. She seemed to have at once sprung into
                  the <emph>woman</emph>—a woman in feeling, in strong resolves. Love doth indeed
                  work wonders.</p>
               <p>"No, Lizzie," said he in reply to her remarks, "do not in your youth and beauty
                  cast yourself within the walls of a living tomb. Believe me, you will yet be
                  happy."</p>
               <p>She shook her head, but made no reply, except what could be understood from a
                  half-suppressed sigh.</p>
               <p>"I came into the room, sir," said she, after a moment's silence, "to tell you some
                  news, but that letter drove it all out of my head. We have a new boarder who has
                  just come. She has the back parlor and the room that adjoins yours."</p>
               <p>"Who is she?"</p>
               <p>"Mother says that she is a very rich Southern widow; her name is Montrose. She
                  seems to be Spanish or Italian, and she has a maid with her who is one of the
                  prettiest girls I ever saw. I expect this Southern lady will turn the heads of all
                  the gentlemen in the house. She too, is very handsome and young."</p>
               <p>"Has she no friends or relatives with her?"</p>
               <p>"None but this maid."</p>
               <p>"That is rather singular; but there's no accounting for these widows, they're
                  wilful and wayward."</p>
               <p>"She, seems very gay!" said Lizzie—"but there's some one coming—it is Mr. Hilton's
                  step, please keep my folly secret, sir! I will <emph>try</emph> not to love
                  you."</p>
               <p>As she said this she passed out, meeting Hilton at the threshold of the door. He
                  bowed and blushed, <emph>why</emph>, none but a timid man in love, can
                  explain.</p>
               <p>She, however, seemed to recover her spirits when she saw him, or else she forced
                  an appearance of it, for she cried gaily,</p>
               <p>"Mother has got a sweetheart for you, Mr. Hilton—such a <emph>pretty</emph> widow!
                  Mr Cramer 'll tell you about her!"</p>
               <p>"I wish your mother would give me <emph>you</emph> for a sweetheart!" muttered the
                  young soldier, but she was half way down stairs before he spoke, and didn't hear
                  him.</p>

               <p>IT was night, and in a large hall in the north-western part of the city was
                  assembled a vast crowd, mostly composed of members of the "O. of U. A.," and of
                  the fair Daughters of America. It was night, and the anniversary of the birth-day
                  of George Washington, the chosen son of Liberty, the god-father of American
                  Freedom The room was filled to its utmost capability. The glittering stars and
                  rainbow hues of the beautiful regalia shone gaily in every part of the room, and
                  hundreds of bright eyes and fair as well as manly faces were turned toward the
                  speakers' stand, where Ernest Cramer had just risen to address them. His voice was
                  low and tremulous, but ere he had spoken one sentence, by their kind applause they
                  drove all fear and faint-heartedness from him, and his voice rose as he went on.
                  These were his words:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Brothers</emph>,—brothers by a tie dearer than that of consanguinity; for
                  it is the tie of country, of patriotism, of Freedom's harmony, that binds us,—I
                  rise before you, sad and faint-hearted, because I feel too incompetent to fulfil
                  the duties you call upon me to perform. You have called me here to address my
                  fellow-countrymen upon the anniversary CHRISTMAS of American Liberty. And I know
                  not in what way to so condense the ten thousand themes connected with this
                  glorious day, as to please myself and satisfy you.</p>
               <p>"In selecting a name for your Chapter, brothers, you chose one which stands high
                  upon the roll of fame—one of the greatest of the Naval heroes of the American
                  Revolution. And as our Navy did much toward gaining our liberties, I will, if you
                  please, glance with you briefly over its history, commencing with the first
                  capture on record.</p>
               <p>"In 1772, the English government had a schooner of war stationed on Long Island
                  Sound, called the Gaspe, manned by a crew of twenty-seven men, and well equipped
                  for service. Her commander was an insolent and overbearing man, who was very fond
                  of exercising the right of <emph>search;</emph> a right we, Americans, ever
                     <emph>have</emph>, and ever <emph>will</emph> consider <emph>wrong</emph>—a
                  wrong which we are too <emph>proud</emph> to endure! On the 17th of June, 1772, a
                  packet which plied between this city and Providence, named the Hannah, (after a
                  blue-eyed Yankee girl, of course,) was chased by the Gaspe, and ordered to
                  heave-to, that she might be examined! Captain Linzie, of the Hannah, was too much
                  of a man to bend to this, and he pressed on sail, refusing to heave-to! For
                  twenty-five miles the chase was continued; and then the Captain of the Hannah, who
                  knew the channel well, took an inside passage among the reefs; and the Gaspe, in
                  trying to follow, got aground! The packet soon arrived at Providence, in safety;
                  and when the news of the chase was circulated, a strong excitement immediately
                  arose. As soon as night came on, and darkness veiled their movements, sixty
                  volunteers embarked from Providence wharf in boats; and ere midnight, the crew of
                  the British schooner were prisoners, and the vessel was <emph>fired</emph>, and
                  burned! The British government offered ¥1,000 sterling for the apprehension of the
                  leader of that bold expedition, and ¥500 for any of the other parties; but
                  traitors were <emph>scarce</emph> in those days, and <emph>gold</emph> couldn't
                  buy them!</p>
               <p>"The next naval incident, if such it may be called, was the Boston tea-party,
                  where the white Indians, painted and disguised for the occasion, made Boston
                  harbor their tea-pot, and invited John Bull to take tea with <emph>salt</emph>,
                  instead of sugar, in the cup! And then, after that, the Chart of
                     <emph>Freedom</emph>—the catechism of dear Liberty, the Declaration of American
                  Independence, came before the world; was <emph>signed</emph>, adopted, and became
                     <emph>immortal!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"The first naval combat that took place after the battle of Lexington, was between
                  the British armed schooner Margaretta, and a sloop from Machias, Maine, which,
                  though manned by mere volunteers, and these but half armed, whipped her, and
                  brought her into port, on the 9th of May, 1775, with a loss of twenty killed and
                  wounded!</p>
               <p>"After the Revolution had fairly got under headway, each State furnished<pb
                     n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6961-00000068"/> nished a vessel or two, for a kind of
                  combined navy, but there was little service of note performed by these vessels,
                  until 1776, when, by the capture of British transports, which were bringing
                  reinforcements here to their army, they served the cause of liberty with
                  incalculable effect.</p>
               <p>"The English, however, during the year 1776, swarmed along our coast with their
                  numerous navy; and on the 4th of June, 1776, under the command of Commodore
                  Parker, they commenced an attack upon Fort Moultrie, at Charleston, which lasted,
                  off and on, for nearly twenty days, and which ended in the Americans sinking one
                  of the English frigates, and driving off the rest! From this time, on, during the
                  entire Revolution, our naval career was but a succession of triumphs. PAUL JONES
                  carried our flag proudly to the very shores of England—broke through her famed
                  wooden walls, and astonished the <emph>natives,</emph> in every sense of the word!
                  He entered the enemy's ports. and fired their ships; fought the bloodiest naval
                  battle ever recorded, and won a victory over an immensely superior force, in sight
                  of their own shores, falsifying the proud boast that Britain was Queen of the Sea!
                  It was not until 1779, that a regularly regulated naval force belonged to this
                  country; until then our battles having been fought by privateers and French
                  vessels loaned to us, by that government which gave us a Lafayette, and which has
                  become a <emph>Republic,</emph> following our example, and dethroning the last
                  tyrant, we may hope and pray, which may ever wear a crown in La Belle France!
                  During this year, the old Constitution, the glorious old Ironsides, as our seamen
                  loved to call her, was placed in service; that ship which has come out victorious
                  from more battles than any other has ever been engaged in; a ship which seemed to
                  be fated for good luck, and which is yet held in so much respect and reverence,
                  that it is considered an honor to be one of her crew, even in these peaceful
                  times! At this time, some young officers entered the service, whose names in after
                  years rose high upon the list of fame. At this time PERRY, the father of the
                  Commodore Perry, whom this Chapter is named after, commanded a privateer. At this
                  time Barron, McDonough, Preble and Truxtun, Rogers, Porter and Murray entered the
                  service, destined in a few more years to distinguish themselves in the Tripolitan
                  war; a war, if I have not been misinformed, in which <emph>one</emph> member of
                  Perry Chapter had a hand. A war which, though brief, was bloody and perilous; one
                  in which, with a single misfortune, the loss of the <hi rend="i"/>Philadelphia, by
                  her accidentally getting on a reef, was a second series of brilliant and gallant
                  victories. And even in the loss of the Philadelphia, Yankee spirit shone out; for
                  our gallant Decatur, aided by brave men, in the most intrepid manner, burned her
                  in the enemy's own <unclear>port rather</unclear> than let her remain as a prize
                  to an insolent foe!</p>
               <p>"But when the war of 1812 opened, then commenced the era of naval glory for this
                  country! This war was caused by aggression upon our <emph>Navy,</emph> by the
                  insolence of the English in enforcing a search on board of our vessels for all men
                  whom they chose to consider English born. The cowardly and treacherous assault
                  upon the frigate Chesapeake, by the Leopard, was the forerunner of heavier work.
                  The night encounter of the frigate President and an English ship, the Little Belt,
                  which caused a heavy loss to the latter, helped the matter on. The year 1812 came
                  in—war was declared, a war against insolence and oppression. The war began upon
                  the ocean, and was opened with several engagements, in every case victorious on
                  our part. The Constitution now began to be noted. Her first capture was the <hi
                     rend="i"/>Guerriere, of superior force, but whipped in a brief action. and sent
                  to the bottom of the blue sea! The action has been described by many historians,
                  but I think that the story of a French captain describing it, is one of the best I
                  ever heard. If you will permit me, I will tell it in his own words.</p>
               <p>"Shentilmens," said he, "I shall tell you one ver goot story. Ze time of ze last

               <p>"The next proof that the rule was bound to work, was in the capture of the
                  Macedonian, by the United States. Com. Decatur was in charge of her, and I am
                  proud to think that the Order of United Americans can claim a Decatur as well as a

               <p>"Next the Constitution—the glorious 'Ironsides,' took the <hi rend="i"/>Java,
                  another frigate of superior force. Then again, good luck following her, she took
                  the Cyane and Levant.</p>
               <p>"It were injustice to this chapter for me not to allude in the history of our
                  naval glories to the deeds of those brave men, who upon the inland seas, the
                  western lakes, emulated the deeds of their brethren upon the Atlantic. The brave
                  McDonough—and the noble PERRY, deserve a moment's notice. With small vessels,
                  manned almost entirely by landsmen, on two several occasions they met a superior
                  force of well fitted out, and practised British seamen, and on both occasions the
                  result was this. 'They met the enemy—and conquered.' But it would take long hours
                  for me to follow through the history of our navy during the war, and I will not
                  detain you with it, for I hope you are all <emph>American</emph> enough in
                     <emph>heart</emph> and <emph>mind</emph> to read and know the history of your
                  country. Yet, I must allude to one thing—one sad event in our naval history, and
                  that because it has a moral which should be felt and remembered by this Order. I
                  allude to the capture of the Frigate Chesapeake; that ship, whose brave commander
                  died with these words on his lips—'<hi rend="i"/>don't give up the ship!' Had that
                  ship been manned with <emph>Americans</emph> she would <emph>never</emph> nave
                  been given up! But it is a known fact that two-thirds of her crew were foreigners,
                  Dutch, Danes and Irish, and they deserted their guns before the
                     <emph>Americans</emph> on board had fairly got into a fighting humor Let us
                  determine, brothers, never to give up the ship—and to prevent the danger of that
                  dire sorrow, let us guard against all <emph>traitors</emph> in our midst; let us
                  keep and preserve our Order purely and truly patriotic. In our anxiety to gain in
                     <emph>numbers</emph>, we must not forget that <emph>one</emph> of the
                     <emph>right</emph> sort, is worth more than a <emph>dozen</emph> of that<pb
                     n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6961-00000071"/> class who are <emph>patriotic</emph>
                  only when it suits their convenience or interest. We <emph>want Americans</emph>
                  in this Order, we want 8,000,000 of them, but we only want those who are American
                  in <emph>heart</emph> as well as <emph>birth!</emph> We want <emph>true</emph> men
                  in our ranks, or none at all.</p>
               <p>"Are there any Americans here who do not belong to our Order? If so, I would take
                  a moment to explain to them the necessity for this Order—its <emph>use,</emph> and
                  its aim.</p>
               <p>"First, its necessity! We find that thousands and hundreds of thousands of paupers
                  are landed each year upon our shores, ignorant men who have been born and bred
                  under monarchial rule—who are all unfit to feel or to act as freemen, and yet they
                  are let loose upon our soil, adopted as citizens, given free votes, and
                     <emph>prepared</emph> to act as <emph>tools</emph> for any <emph>Arnold</emph>
                  or demagogue who wishes to <emph>bribe</emph> or <emph>hire</emph> their aid to
                  place him in high power. They fill our alms houses; they have a large majority in
                  our <emph>prisons</emph> too—they underwork our own Mechanics—they are as fit
                     <emph>slaves</emph> to the aristocracy of <emph>wealth</emph> in our land, as
                  they were to the aristocracy of governmental power in their own land. To protect
                  ourselves—our constitution, and our very lives against these Goths and Vandals, we
                  have considered it necessary to band ourselves together as United Americans.</p>
               <p>"The <emph>use</emph> of our Order is that it is founded upon the beautiful and
                  christian principle of charity! we are linked together as brothers. In our
                  business we aid and advance each other. In our sickness we aid, cherish and attend
                  each other. And if one of us is called away, his widow and orphans, if such he
                  have, are cared for and protected. Their grief is softened by kindness, they are
                  not allowed to fall into the misery of despair, or left to die in abject poverty,
                  neglected by those who are born upon our soil. We have a fund to aid our sick or
                  disabled brethren—we have also our widows' and orphans' fund to assist the
                  stricken of God's providence.</p>
               <p>"And the <emph>aim</emph> of this Order is to perpetuate the freedom which
                  Almighty God, through his servant George Washington, and the noble compeers of
                  that great and good man, gave to us to enjoy and keep. It is to keep the
                  government of this land in <emph>American</emph> hands; to try to hold our own,
                  and not be driven from our birth-right That there is danger of this, who may
                  doubt. To-day, while the procession in honor of the anniversary was passing along
                  the street, a Greek, or Patlander, was heard to exclaim:</p>
               <p>"Sure, an' if they're the natives, they'd better be off to
                  <emph>Californy!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I thought, if you and your Jesuit master, Bishop Hughes, had their way, we'd
                  soon be off to California—soon be forced, like the once powerful Indians, back
                  from the Atlantic shore—forced to yield this proud city for a <emph>kingdom</emph>
                  and <emph>home</emph> to the Pope who has been driven from Rome: even though, as
                  Bishop Hughes said in the Freeman's Journal a short time since—'<emph>This country
                     is too uncivilized to receive his Holiness!</emph>' Yes, it is, and I pray God
                  it will be—will be while I live! Oh, Americans, it is <emph>time</emph> indeed
                  that we were <emph>all</emph> banded together for the protection of our rights,
                  our laws and our institutions! To this aim and for this use has this Order been
                  instituted; and to aid in the good cause the Order of the Daughters of America,
                  and the United American Mechanics have also been formed. They are all rapidly
                  increasing. By the last statistical information which I could gain, these Orders,
                     <emph>united,</emph> in the different States, number about 60,000 souls;
                     <emph>more,</emph> actually, than we had at any one time under arms in our army
                  during that Revolution which made us a free and a glorious nation.</p>
               <p>"A <emph>glorious</emph> nation, I said. Wherein is our glory? First, it is in
                  this, that when bowed down with oppression, the sons of America, though few in
                  number, <emph>mighty</emph> with anger and indignation, rose and threw off the
                  yoke of slavery! Glorious, that in two long and bloody wars, we defeated the most
                  powerful nation on earth, and taught her a lesson which she can <emph>never</emph>
                  forget! But <emph>glorious,</emph> most glorious, that she gave a birth-place to
                  him whose birth-day we have assembled to celebrate!</p>

               <p>"Who can think of him, and not remember and admire the courage which enabled him
                  to cope with a powerful foe amid all disadvantages; who had the skill and bravery,
                  after a long and desperate struggle, to conquer that foe; and <emph>then</emph>
                  possessed the wisdom, honesty, moderation, and noble patriotism, to make that
                  victory subservient to his country's good, rather than a stepping-stone to his own
                  ambition; to refuse a crown, and to receive, instead, the everlasting gratitude of
                  a <emph>free</emph> and happy Republic! Scotland has boasted of her William
                  Wallace, Switzerland of her Tell, Greece of her Marco Bozarris, Ireland of her
                  martyred Emmett, yet it was reserved for us <emph>alone</emph> to boast of
                     <emph>such</emph> a man as <emph>Washington!</emph> Of all the patriots whom I
                  have named, none were like him! When the clouds of misfortune were hovering
                  darkest over our land, <emph>he</emph> was cheerful, bold and unflinching in his
                  virtuous intrepidity! And when success gladdened our cause, then was he even to
                  his enemies, generous and magnanimous! He was, indeed, a '<emph>model</emph> MAN!'
                  One who combined the essence of goodness with greatness; he <choice>
                     <sic>was was</sic>
                     <corr>was</corr>

                     <emph>forever</emph> in the hearts of his countrymen. To whom on earth can we
                  compare him? As a successful warrior shall we compare him to Napoleon? No,
                  Napoleon was born a peasant; he rose to be a conqueror; he abused his power; and
                  died at last a heart-broken captive! But, brothers, gentlemen and ladies, I have
                  already occupied you too long. There is nothing more pleasant than the duty I am
                  now performing, yet I feel that I have trespassed upon your time long enough.
                  Permit me, in closing, to quote the words of one who loves his country well, and
                  to hope that this glad anniversary will long be <emph>celebrated</emph> and held

               <p>A LOVE SCENE. Was you ever in love, reader? Methinks I hear you reply, "What a
                  foolish question! Does there exist a being who has <emph>not</emph> loved?" If
                  so,—but it is not so—it <emph>can't</emph> be so! All things love; the birds of
                  the air, the beasts of the field; and can <emph>we</emph>, who have souls and
                  hearts and minds, avoid loving? No, no more than we can live without food or
                  drink. Love is nature, nature is love! But I must hold up, or folks will think
                  that I'm in <emph>love</emph>, and such a thought would be very unjust, though
                  with a blush I will acknowledge that I <emph>did</emph> love
                  <emph>once</emph>,—aye, more than loved—worshipped the object of my love with a
                  mad and reckless adoration which knew no bounds;—but of this, no more, or I'll get
                  "the blues."</p>
               <p>It was evening. Ernest Cramer was seated in the parlor of the Clifford mansion, at
                  Japonica Place. Near him sat La Belle Serena, looking, if possible, lovelier than
                  ever he had seen her before. No one else was in the room. Ernest was pale and
                  nervous; he looked as if "something was the matter" with him, and so there
                  was.</p>
               <p>"You seem very melancholy to-night, Mr. Cramer!" said the lady.</p>
               <p>"And yet," he replied, "I was never happier than at this moment. There is, as you
                  know, lady, a grief which tears cannot express, and which can make no utterance.
                  God save us ever from <emph>that</emph> grief, for it is terrible to endure! And
                  so there is a happiness which is too intense for utterance—a joy which neither
                  words or actions can describe!"</p>
               <p>"And pray, sir, why are you so happy?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, lady would that I dare tell you!"</p>
               <p>"Surely there can be no harm in telling one who aspires to be your friend, and who
                  would sympathise with your joys, as also in your sorrows."</p>
               <p>"Lady, I am happy because I am in your presence—so near that I can hear your sweet
                  voice—so near that I can gaze into the blue depths of your glorious eyes—so
                  near—"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Cramer!"</p>
               <p>It was now the lady's turn to look pale and tremble. She first turned pale as a
                  lily, then red as the rose sun-lighted.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Miss Serena, forgive me; but it is too late for me to pause. I must
                  avow my feelings for you. I did not think I could muster courage enough to do so
                  in person, and had written a letter to explain my feelings; but now, lady, I can
                  tell you all. From the first hour that I have met you, I have loved you. In vain
                  have I striven to repress, or at least conceal, my feelings: forgive me, though
                  you drive me forever from your presence—hear me!"</p>
               <p>The only answer was a sigh. A tear was quivering on either eyelid; her bosom was
                  heaving with emotion. What could Ernest augur from these tokens? He moved closer
                  to her side; he took her fair hand in his, and when he felt its warm pulses
                  beating quickly, hotly as his own, a thrill as of electric fire passed through his
                  frame. She did not withdraw the hand; he raised it to his burning lips, and
                  pressed upon it a fervent kiss; and yet it still trembled in his own.</p>
               <p>"Oh, lady, may I hope that I am not utterly indifferent to you—at least, that no
                  other has a claim upon this precious hand—no other found a home within your warm,
                  pure heart!"</p>
               <p>Still she did not speak—she sighed; the long lashes which veiled her eyes drooped
                  down on a blushing cheek; her red lips quivered, but no more.</p>
               <p>The suspense and excitement of Cramer became more intense.</p>
               <p>"Lady," said he, "I pray you in mercy to speak. If you cannot return the love
                  which I lay down upon the altar of your worth and beauty, speak, and let me know
                  the worst. If I am so hapless as to offend you by this declaration, I will never
                  again offend; I will fly far, far from here, and seek some field where life can be
                  laid down with honor—for life, without you, were worse than worthless to me!"</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6961-00000074"/>
               <p>"<emph>Ernest!</emph>"</p>
               <p>She spoke that word—no more; and yet the tone in which it was uttered, the look
                  which accompanied it, told him more than a volume could have contained.</p>
               <p>"Serena, oh, may I hope?"</p>
               <p>"Ernest, <emph>dear</emph> Ernest!"</p>
               <p>Words could say no more. Tears were fast flowing down the cheeks of both; but such
                  tears as are blessed by those who shed them—tears of happiness.</p>
               <p>She did not reprove him when, in his wild enthusiasm, he caught her in his arms,
                  and pressed her to his manly breast; she did not chide him when he pressed his
                  burning lips to hers; she blushed, and perchance forgetful of all but the mutual
                  confession, returned the warm pressure of the first pure, burning kisses of
                  honorable love! Moment of unutterable happiness! Why could not both have died then
                  and there, rather than to live in a world where change will come—where clouds will
                  gather—where storms will break, and breaking, destroy the flowers of hope and joy!
                  Oh, that death could come in such an hour, then would it lose all its terrors!</p>
               <p>Uncounted are such moments as then passed. Time is swift as lightning when
                  sunlight gilds its wings; but when sorrow's rain damps its pinions, or
                  oppression's chain clogs them, then indeed do the moments pass slowly and
                  drearily. But we will leave the now confessed lovers to talk over the realities
                  which are the crowning jewels of pure love, and to arrange about getting parental
                  consent, matrimony, &amp;c.,—that is, if with them the course of true love runs
                  smooth. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Nous verrons!</foreign>"</p>

               <p>Another love scene. Surely, this chapter is all love, thinks the reader. When
                  Ernest Cramer left his room for Japonica Place that evening, he did not press
                  Harry Hilton to accompany him, and had he done so, the latter would have refused.
                  At or near the time when Ernest was avowing his love to La Belle Serena, a
                  similar, and yet a different scene was occurring in the neat little back parlor on
                  the first floor, at the Widow Laurel's. Harry Hilton was there, and so was Lizzie,
                  looking quite like a little woman in her long dress. On his face was an air of
                  nervousness; the color seemed higher than usual, and his manner was somewhat
                  agitated. Lizzie, however, looked as gay and mischievous as if never a tear had
                  glittered in her dark eye. She had evidently just been saying something that vexed
                  and annoyed him, for he said, in a fretful tone:</p>
               <p>"Is it impossible for you, Miss Lizzie, ever to be serious? I tell you that I love
                  you, seriously love you!"</p>
               <p>"And, Mr. Hilton," she replied, laughing, "I respectfully tell you that I do not
                  seriously love <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But, Lizzie, dear Lizzie, you might treat me kindly, at least."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hilton, I do mean to treat you kindly, but kindness isn't <emph>love!</emph>
                  Why do you talk of love to a young thing like me? Why, there is Mrs. Montrose, who
                  evidently is smitten with you—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, she may go to—Paradise! I detest her!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>oh</emph>, Mr. Hilton! how ungallant you are! <emph>If</emph> I should
                  tell her, she'd go into convulsions, or some other fashionable thing."</p>
               <p>"Do stop, Lizzie, and hear me once. You are young, I am a soldier—"</p>
               <p>"And very good-looking, why didn't you say?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, pshaw, Lizzie! <emph>Please</emph> don't interrupt me. I said I was a
                  soldier; I shall be soon off on service, and all that I ask is that you will
                  remember me; for as you grow older, and know that one constant heart beats for you
                  alone, you may yet be induced to feel some pity for me."</p>
               <p>"You must cut off a lock of your hair, then, sir, and let me sew it up in a bit of
                  'true blue' silk, and wear it in my shoe, and then—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lizzie, you are as cruel as you are beautiful. You know not what it is to
                  love!"</p>
               <p>She answered with a sigh so deep and full, that had he the least knowledge of
                  human nature, he would have known that it meant <emph>something</emph>.</p>
               <p>For a moment she remained silent and thoughtful, and the soldier, repulsed at
                  every point, felt like retreating from the field of battle<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000075"/> Both were rather embarrassed; but a relief came to
                  them in the entrance of our old acquaintance, "Gulietta," now Mrs. Montrose.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, I hope I do not intrude; I felt so lonely in my room," she said,
                  bowing.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is a favor; indeed I was going to look for you. Mr. Hilton felt so lonely
                  that I felt like having the mumps myself. He is always gayer when you are near, I
                  believe, madam."</p>
               <p>A look from Hilton would not have flattered the widow, had she seen it; but she
                  did not; and replying—"You're a little flatterer, I fear, Miss," seated herself
                  near Hilton on the sofa.</p>
               <p>"Why are you so sad, sir?" she continued, casting a melting glance toward him.</p>
               <p>"I am not sad; it is only that little tease bantering me," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Hilton! what fibs you do tell! I've a great mind to tell Mrs. Montrose
                  what you said about her beautiful eyes—I will, if you don't look out."</p>
               <p>Lizzie didn't wait for an answer, but ran out of the room, leaving Hilton in a
                  worse bother than ever.</p>
               <p>"I assure you, madam, that she is merely speaking thus to banter me."</p>
               <p>"You need make no excuses," said the widow in a low tone. "She said nothing to
                  offend me. I am sure it would be but a pleasure to possess any feature which was
                  beautiful in <emph>your</emph> eyes."</p>
               <p>The lady spoke this with such a marked emphasis, that Hilton could not avoid
                  noticing it. He raised his eyes to hers, and then found her gaze fixed on his own
                  so earnestly, that a flush mantled his face. A blush darkened the transparency of
                  her brunette cheek also, and both seemed confused. It was impossible that here was
                  more love, yet it looked a little like it. After a few moments silence, the lady
                  again spoke.</p>
               <p>"You seem so quiet, that I shall begin to believe that Miss Laurel was correct,
                  sir," said she, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I am not very well; I've a slight headache. Excuse me, if I am so dull: I will
                  retire;" and Hilton, completely out of sorts, retired to the room occupied by
                  himself and Cramer, and lighted a segar to console himself with.</p>
               <p>A couple of hours later, Ernest entered—his face beaming with happiness—his manner
                  so excited, that Hilton exclaimed—"Why, surely you've been drinking, Ernest?"</p>
               <p>"Not of anything earthly, Harry: I've been making love!"</p>
               <p>"So have I!"</p>
               <p>"Successfully?"</p>
               <p>"No, got laughed at for my pains; but you?"</p>
               <p>"Have been so happy as to become an accepted lover; yes, Serena Clifford has
                  promised to be mine!"</p>
               <p>"I congratulate you!" said Hilton, sighing.</p>
               <p>"Wherefore that sigh, Harry? Are you so simple as to feel wretched about the love
                  of a child?"</p>
               <p>"Just <emph>so</emph> foolish, Ernest. But what do you think of the widow? She
                  seems very attentive to you."</p>
               <p>"If so, entirely without encouragement on <emph>my</emph> part; but I thought the
                  boot was on the other leg. She seems to be rather smitten with you. She certainly
                  is very agreeable; and, if we can judge from appearances, is rich as Croesus!"</p>
               <p>"How singular it was that she should secure your Italian protege for a maid!"</p>
               <p>"It was singular; but I am glad of it; I am happy that Desca is now in a reputable
                  and pleasant situation—one that removes her from the dangers and insults which
                  before menaced her."</p>
               <p>"She is very beautiful!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and all as pure and innocent as she is beautiful, if I am a judge of human
                  nature."</p>
               <p>"I don't think we can say quite as much for her mistress."</p>
               <p>"She seems <emph>rather</emph> forward, but I think it is more coquetry than
                  anything else."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>ERNEST CRAMER was seated at his writing table on the morning after his
                  betrothal-interview with La Belle Serena. Hilton had gone out. Ernest had just
                  finished and sealed a letter, when Lizzie Laurel came in and handed him a
                  card.</p>
               <p>"The gentleman who brought it is waiting below, sir!" she said. "Shall I tell him
                  to come up?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you please, Lizzie—but stay a moment. I have something to say to
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"To <emph>me</emph>, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Lizzie. I heard a sad complaint of you last evening."</p>
               <p>"A complaint, Mr. Cramer? What was it?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hilton says you treated him very ill."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I did not, sir. He made love to me, and I only laughed at him."</p>
               <p>"But, Lizzie, he <emph>really</emph> loves you."</p>
               <p>"I can't help that, sir. I'm sure it is no fault of mine."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Lizzie, you are <emph>beautiful!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"If I am, sir, God made me so. But, Mr. Cramer, <emph>you</emph> did not think me
                  beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Lizzie, I always did."</p>
               <p>"And yet, sir—you—you—"</p>
               <p>She paused, blushed, and did not finish the remark.</p>
               <p>"You would say that your beauty did not win my love—that I love another! It is
                  true, my sweet Lizzie—but do you know there is a kind of <emph>fate</emph> in
                  love. We often love the very antipodes of ourselves, both in looks and feelings.
                  Mr. Hilton loves you—and I only wish that you could return his affection, for he
                  is a noble young man."</p>
               <p>"That can never be!" replied the young girl with a sigh "Mr. Cramer, you know my
                  feelings—I am not one to change, but I pray you never to speak to me of my loving
                  another again. Excuse me—I will go and send the gentleman up."</p>
               <p>"She retired, and in a few moments the door again opened, and MR. ARNOLD entered.
                  His black hair was combed down as sleekly as usual on either side of his low
                  unintellectual forehead, his face was pale, and his eyes somewhat red, as if he
                  had been on "a bender."</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr. Arnold—you are welcome to my little sanctum again!" said
                  Cramer, rising, and with his usual frankness extending his hand to the
                  visitor.</p>
               <p>"I am very happy to see you, Mr. Cramer!" rejoined the latter, grasping the
                  extended hand and shaking it heartily. "I am sorry I cannot yet give you the grip
                  of the American Order, but I hope soon to be able to do so. I called this morning
                  to see you about proposing me as a member. The arguments in your last address,
                  convinced me that it is the duty, the sacred <emph>duty</emph> of every true
                  American to link himself with that glorious brotherhood, who are pledged to
                  preserve the institutions and freedom of America."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say so, Mr. Arnold! Every recruit counts
                  <emph>one</emph>—the Order was commenced by only <emph>thirteen</emph>, a few
                  short years since, and from that ominous and happy number, it has spread until the
                  names of many <emph>thousands</emph> are on its roll."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it <emph>must</emph> succeed! The God of Liberty will protect it—the
                  friendly shade of the immortal Washington will hover above and bless it. But your
                  rules of proposition for membership—I wish to understand them. How is it
                  done?"</p>
               <p>"I will take your name, residence, occupation, age, and place of birth. These I
                  will state in a proposition to the Order, at our next meeting. A committee will
                  then be appointed who will call upon you, learn from your references and those who
                  know you, your character. If they report satisfactorily, you will be ballotted
                  for, and if <emph>elected</emph>, will then be initiated and received as one of
                  us. We are particular, because it is necessary in an Order like ours, to have none
                  but good men and true."</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6961-00000077"/>
               <p>"Correct! You cannot be too guarded—yet I hope to pass the ordeal safely. I am
                  well known and can give excellent references."</p>
               <p>"I am sure, sir, that I shall be happy to hail you as a Brother. We need those
                  who, like yourself, are enthusiastic in the cause—those who are ready to risk
                  lives and fortunes, as did the glorious signers of the Declaration of
                  Independence, in the cause before them."</p>
               <p>"I only regret," replied Arnold, "that I can do so little. Long before I read one
                  line from your pen, my mind wandered over the very subjects which you are now so
                  ably handling, and often did I wish for talent and power, and courage, to launch
                  forth upon the very sea whereon your noble bark is battling—often did I long to
                  see some one come out as you have done, and say to the foreign intruder, Thus far
                  shalt thou come, but no further; to the oppressor and the wrong doer—Hold! hold,
                  or the weight of your wrongs shall be cast back upon your own wicked heads. When I
                  saw your writings, my heart leaped high with joy—I have found him—I have found
                  him! was my cry."</p>
               <p>"Sir, you flatter me."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Justice</emph> is not flattery, Mr. Cramer. But a question, if you please.
                  In joining your Order, am I so pledged that I lose either a political or religious
                  position which I may hold?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir! It is sometimes falsely reported that we are an exclusively political
                  Order, that we are bigoted and fanatical. This is not so. The principles of our
                  Order are described in our motto, 'Patriotism, Charity, and Harmony,' for the U.
                  A.—'Honesty, Industry and Sobriety,' for the U. A. M."</p>
               <p>"Noble mottoes! Let men but live up to them, and wherever those Orders spread,
                  they will bear God's holy blessing with them!" cried Arnold, in a tone of
                  enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and win <emph>respect</emph>, even from the foreigner!" added Cramer "It is
                  a great and a pleasant thing to be respected by those who dislike us most."</p>
               <p>"It is, and I may without flattery say, that you have forced many of those with
                  whom you war, to respect, while they fear and hate you."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear so, but there is but little hope in the respect of the fear of
                  a set of thieving gamblers. They are like some children—they fear while the rod is
                  held over them, they respect you, while they feel that they are in your
                  power."</p>
               <p>"You do indeed possess a vast knowledge of human nature!" said Arnold. "I was just
                  thinking that such might be the case amongst them. But I have a question to ask—I
                  feel curious to know how you become acquainted with so many of these deeds of
                  darkness, how you find out the localities of the gamblers and so faithfully
                  describe the evil doing, which you so boldly and justly condemn."</p>
               <p>A reply was on Cramer's lips—a frank and open reply, but when he looked Arnold in
                  the eye, that individual cast his glance to the floor and seemed intent upon
                  observing the pattern of the carpet. This caused Ernest to make a different reply
                  than that which he first intended.</p>
               <p>"It matters not <emph>how</emph> I find out, since I do, and am most accurate in
                  my details!" he replied. "Were these wretches to learn how I acquire my knowledge
                  of their movements, their aim would be to prevent it, and they might succeed."</p>
               <p>"But you do not think that I would tell!"</p>
               <p>"Of course not, sir; but I make it a rule to keep my movements to myself, and then
                  no accident can reveal them; or if it does, it is my own fault, and I have no one
                  else to blame."</p>
               <p>"Right. But it is strange how accurate you are! I am told by those who pretend to
                  know, that your description of the case of poor young Hagerman is correct to an
                  item, and yet the sharpers were doubly cautious with him, and very secret, for
                  they had a large stake to play for."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and they won <emph>a large stake!</emph> They won him away from a happy
                  home—they won him from he arms of a happy bride—they damned him utterly, made a
                  thief of him, ruined him soul and body! He is now a wanderer and a fugitive—his
                  wife is dying of a broken heart—his gray-haired mother is descending rapidly in
                  sorrow to the grave."</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6961-00000078"/>
               <p>"It is terrible to think of! Who can gamble when they see the evil effects of that
                  passion so strongly depicted?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Who!</emph>" cried Cramer, much excited—"who but the very men who
                     <emph>make</emph> the laws! Who but those who are sworn to execute them—who but
                  they, thrice perjured, double-distilled villains! Here is a city of half a million
                  of inhabitants, guarded by nine hundred sworn policemen, governed by a Mayor and
                  nearly forty members of council—each sworn to support and see that the laws are
                  fulfilled, and to do the duties of their office faithfully; with nearly as many
                  judges and magistrates, and yet what exists? The Halls of Justice, and the very
                  rooms where these <emph>officers</emph> of the people meet, are surrounded by
                  brothels and gambling hells, and they <emph>know</emph> it. Aye, some of them
                     <emph>often</emph> visit these places."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yes</emph>, Mr. Arnold. I can point to you a judge who has sent many a
                  trembling wretch to prison for no crime at all, who can almost nightly be found in
                  a brothel! I can show you others, who, sworn to fulfil the laws and see them
                  fulfilled, are the most constant devotees at the gambling table! <emph>I know
                     these things to be so, for I have seen them!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Do they not fear exposure?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and what is the consequence? A gambler fleeces some one who will not tamely
                  bear the loss. This person complains; a warrant is sworn out; the gambler is
                  arrested, held to bail, perhaps, but that is the last of it. Perhaps he is brought
                  to trial. A jury of honest men find him <emph>guilty;</emph> then comes the
                  sentence. The law enables the judge to impose <emph>one year's imprisonment in the
                     penitentiary, and two hundred and fifty dollars fine</emph>, yet I defy you, or
                  any other man, to prove that such a sentence was ever inflicted upon one of the
                  thousand of thieving gamblers who have been arrested for breaking this statute!
                  Oh, my God, what <emph>is</emph> justice in New York! To send a poor homeless man,
                  of woman, to the penitentiary, to herd with thieves and felons, for the
                     <emph>crime</emph> of <emph>poverty</emph>, alone! Yes, they will send a thief
                  to prison for thirty days, and a person found homeless and friendless, for six
                  months, thus <emph>encouraging theft!</emph> Mr. Arnold, I do not exaggerate; it
                  is so true, that you have but to look at the <emph>Records</emph> to verify what I
                  say."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed no wonder that you are so strenuous for reform when you descry such
                  monstrous evils! But my time is much occupied by numerous engagements to-day—I
                  must bid you good morning. You will do me the favor to propose me as a candidate
                  for admission into your Order?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; please write your name, address, age, business, and birth-place
                  down."</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," replied Arnold, writing. "J. I. Arnold, residence No. — B—
                  street. Age, twenty-eight; my business—what shall I write, Mr. Cramer? I have
                  sufficient means to live upon the income thereof, and have no profession, no
                  business, except that of doing the little in my power to alleviate human
                  misery."</p>
               <p>"Leave occupation blank, then; I will explain that."</p>
               <p>"I was born in the village of —, — county, in this State." continued Arnold,
                  writing it down. "Is this sufficient?"</p>
               <p>"It is; I will propose you at our next meeting."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my kind friend, thank you! Good morning—oh, excuse me; have you any
                  cases under your eye, of extreme poverty, where assistance can be rendered? My
                  purse is at your service for all good works."</p>
               <p>As he said this, Arnold drew a well-filled purse from his pocket. Cramer quietly
                  waved it back.</p>
               <p>"There are many cases," said he; "but to find them you must seek them in the
                  cellars, and those dreary houses where hundreds exist under a single roof, huddled
                  up, nearly naked, often famished for food."</p>
               <p>Arnold heaved a sigh as deep as if it had been really <emph>felt</emph>, bade
                  Cramer good morning, and left the room.</p>
               <p>He had been gone but an instant, when a gentle tap at Ernest's door again aroused
                  him from his writing, which he had resumed</p>
               <p>"Enter," he cried.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and Desca del Onda entered, bearing in her<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000079"/> hand a lovely bouquet of rich exotic flowers, the
                  produce of the hothouse.</p>
               <p>"Madame sends you this, sir," she said, handing it to Cramer, "and begs you to
                  accept of it, for poets love flowers."</p>
               <p>"Your mistress is very kind indeed, Desca; thank her for me, and say that I am
                     <emph>very</emph> fond of flowers."</p>
               <p>Ernest arose, and filled a vase with water, in which he placed the bouquet. Desca
                  stood by the table until this was done, and then, with a sigh, said:</p>
               <p>"My mistress seems very much in love with you, sir."</p>
               <p>"Did she tell you to say so to me, Desca?" asked the young man, quickly.</p>
               <p>She blushed beneath his gaze—blushed and seemed confused.</p>
               <p>"No, sir," she said, hesitatingly; "but—but she is always talking of you: I meant
                  no harm, sir, in speaking of it."</p>
               <p>"Nor did you do any; but, Desca, I'll tell you a secret, and I don't tell you to
                  repeat it; but if your mistress <emph>should</emph> happen to hear that I'm
                  engaged to be <emph>married</emph>, it may prevent her from wasting time in trying
                  to catch me in her husband-net. A rich and handsome widow is certainly a very
                  desirable prize to draw in Life's Lottery, but I've got my ticket already!"</p>
               <p>Desca sighed, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Are you not happy?" asked Cramer. "Is not your mistress kind to you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, she is very kind;" and as she spoke the young Italian sighed again, and
                  moved toward the door. Something seemed to rest heavy on her heart; but she said
                  no more. With a sigh she crossed the threshold of the door, and closed it.</p>
               <p>Again Cramer was alone.</p>
               <p>"Flowers! flowers!" he murmured in soliloquy, as he gazed at the bouquet. "How
                  like human hopes and our waking dreams. Bright in their blossoming, brief in their
                  existence, melancholy in decay!"</p>

               <p>"HIS EMINENCE" was seated in his study, engaged in opening a large pile of letters
                  which had just been brought from the post-office. At his right hand sat a female
                  of eighteen or twenty years of age; a pale, intellectual looking creature, whose
                  large, dark, mournful looking eyes were bent upon him. In her hand she held a
                  pen—paper lay before her; her business was evidently that of an amanuensis. Her
                  dress was black; the cut, that of the "Sisters;" but her hair had not yet known
                  the sacrilegious touch of the scizzors; it hung in luxuriant tresses low down upon
                  her white neck and shoulders, the outlines of which could not be concealed, even
                  by the black and unseemly dress which she wore. She was beautiful—not to a
                     <emph>sensual</emph> eye, yet beautiful in her expression of soulfulness, in
                  her look of intellectuality and feeling. Yet an expression of deep sorrow was
                  settled on her countenance—a look of utter sadness which called for sympathy and
                  pity.</p>
               <p>"Allie," said the priest, handing her a letter which he had just perused, "answer
                  our agent at Chicago! Compliment him upon his talent and success in opening the
                  three schools he alluded to; and, in regard to the property matter, tell him by
                  all means to induce the old gentleman to send his son to the army, and his
                  daughter here to school!"</p>
               <p>The poor girl wrote on, and as she wrote the priest soliloquised. "Yes," he
                  murmured—"the boy once in the army, he can be disposed of easily. I have faithful
                  servants there; the girl <emph>here</emph>, all will be right. If she is
                  beautiful, she shall add to the number of the <emph>chosen;</emph>' if she be not,
                  I've another market for her. The children out of the way, the old man is under our
                  influence, and <emph>one million of dollars</emph> is added to our treasury! It is
                  a great work!"</p>
               <p>He then opened another letter. "Ah," he murmured—"first from<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000080"/> the far North, next from the sunny South. One of
                  the Order is in Tampa Bay, and says there is neither priest or school there;
                  population, fifty families in the place and its neighborhood! This will never
                  do—we must dispatch one of the brotherhood there quickly! Let me see—Paul O'Brien
                  is young and ardent—he will do—yes, we will send him!"</p>
               <p>"I have finished the letter; it is ready for your signature, Eminence!" said the
                  fair amanuensis in a low, sweet tone.</p>
               <p>The priest hastily wrote his name, prefixing it with a †, and then opened another
                  letter, while she sealed and directed the first.</p>
               <p>"From Father Joseph, in Pittsburgh," he muttered, while his brow grew dark. "The
                  heretics there are a high-handed and perverse set. Their preachers harangue in the
                  streets, and denounce our doctrines. The people <emph>hear</emph>, and believe.
                  Curse them—curse them! it is such as they who prevent us from rising! He writes
                  that the secret Orders of Americans are gaining ground there every day—he needs
                  more help! Yes, he <emph>does:</emph> he is too merciful—he lacks energy—he does
                  not take proper means to rid the Church of such foes! He should <emph>act</emph>,
                  not talk. The bowl and the steel! Those are the words. I will answer him
                  myself."</p>
               <p>Seizing a pen, the priest rapidly indicted a letter, which he sealed and directed
                  himself. He then again turned to the unopened letters and took another.</p>
               <p>"Ah—from our Abbess at New Orleans! she is a <emph>star</emph>. She wishes me to
                  pay a visit to her city. I wish I could, but it is impossible. At this crisis I
                  must not leave—the time is coming when I shall be needed! Here, Allie—take this
                  letter and reply to the Abbess, sister Ursula! Tell her that there are plots and
                  plotters at work against us, and that I cannot leave my post. Compliment her upon
                  the success of the seminary—tell her never to let one escape her who can be made
                  useful.</p>
               <p>The fair girl took the letter, and commenced writing. The priest opened another. A
                  smile of satisfaction gathered on his countenance as he read it. "Yes," he said,
                  "I knew General S— would approve of my idea—yes, if I have a few regiments formed
                  of our own men, well drilled and accoutred, if these cursed Native Americans dare
                  to threaten or oppose us, I'll at once rise and show them what our strength is!
                  Then they will see that we have not been idle for the three hundred and fifty
                  years, since our standard was first unfurled in this Western World. Yes, he is
                  right—I will commence it immediately. I will have regiments of Irish and Germans
                  here—men who have no ties in common with the country—who are <emph>bound to obey
                     us!</emph> Oh! with one million such men, and our present power scattered
                  through the land, I could plant the Vicar of Saint Peter at Washington—from here
                  to the Empire of the Church, and ere long be myself at its head! <emph>God</emph>,
                  what a field!"</p>
               <p>So loud had the tone of the Priest become—so enthusiastic his manner, that the
                  young female paused in her writing, and looked at him in astonishment. It was
                  seldom indeed that he so far forgot himself. Observing her pause, he recovered
                  himself.</p>
               <p>"Go on, sweet Allie," he said in a gentle tone. "When a great object for the good
                  of the Church seems destined to a speedy and successful fulfilment, I forget my
                  dignity—forget all things but that God smiles upon our efforts. Write on, my good
                  girl—the first seminary that is vacant, shall be placed under your charge."</p>
               <p>A sickly smile flitted over the fair face of the writer, but she made no
                  reply.</p>
               <p>He opened another letter. Again an exclamation of pleasure passed his lips. "Dead,
                  at last," he muttered—"fifty thousand dollars more in our Treasury. Every drop
                  helps to swell the bulk, and <emph>money</emph> is POWER."</p>
               <p>A tap at the door caused him to start—he waited a moment and it was repeated
                     <emph>thrice</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Come in!" he said.</p>
               <p>His favorite servant came in and handed him a card, at which he glanced.</p>
               <p>"Is this person below?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence."</p>
               <p>"Bid him come up—Allie, retire into the inner room and remain until I call for
                  you."</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6961-00000081"/>
               <p>A few moments elapsed, the door opened, and the servant ushered in JUDAS ISCARIOT
                  ARNOLD, and then retired.</p>
               <p>"I hope I am not intruding upon your Eminence?" said Arnold, glancing at the
                  letters on the table.</p>
               <p>"Not at all, sir, for this hour is devoted by me always to the business of the
                  Church, and I presume yours is a business call."</p>
               <p>"It is. I have called merely to report progress in the case of Cramer."</p>
               <p>"Well."</p>
               <p>"I have everything arranged to enter his Order. Within a week I can lay bare all
                  its secret movements to your Eminence, and within a week I shall begin to
                     '<emph>act</emph>,' shall commence knitting the meshes of that net which shall
                  yet entangle him."</p>
               <p>"It is well; your plan, if properly carried out, cannot fail. But it must be sure,
                  we must not strike him alone, we must strike at the very heart of that Order, for
                  it is gathering power each day—sweeping like a mighty wave through the land, and
                  where it passes our strength withers away. It <emph>must</emph> be crushed, or
                     <emph>we</emph> lost."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>he</emph> must be crushed, or those by whom I am employed are lost!"
                  added Arnold. "He seems by some magic art to find out all their plans; he saves
                  victim after victim from their toils; they scarcely get their eye on a good
                  chance, and begin to work, before he warns the victim of his danger, or frightens
                  him from playing!"</p>
               <p>"How does he learn your movements?"</p>
               <p>"That is a question we are fruitlessly asking. No one can tell! He describes scene
                  after scene just as it occurs, yet he never is seen at one of our saloons; if he
                  were, it would be but a short shrift he would have. More than twenty of our most
                  reckless and desperate men have sworn to take his life."</p>
               <p>"Not yet; not yet; we must not slay him till we can strike a blow which will hurt
                  his <emph>cause</emph>, while it crushes him!" said the priest.</p>
               <p>"You would find it difficult to restrain the hand of some of our men, if they only
                  had a good chance at him!" said Arnold. "But what I would say to your Eminence
                  is—is there not some means in your power by which we can detect the way in which
                  he discovers these things, which we in vain try to keep secret?"</p>
               <p>"Will he not tell you? Can you not gain his confidence?"</p>
               <p>"He keeps his own secrets! I have tried him, and could learn nothing in regard to
                  the matter."</p>
               <p>"It will be strange if a woman cannot worm the secret out of him!" said the
                  priest. "I will have it tried; I expect a visit from one this morning, who has
                  already cast a charm in his path, if my judgment errs not; I will direct her to
                  the task."</p>
               <p>"Your Eminence will do us a great favor; did we but know how he manages to learn
                  our secrets, we could foil him. He robs us of too many good chances, and the
                  officers of the law begin to fear him; or rather that he will awaken the people to
                  their perjuries and delinquencies."</p>
               <p>"It is well; his movements can be detected. Nothing is impossible with us."</p>
               <p>"Nothing should be. You have power, wealth, learning. Every thing seems combined
                  in favor of your cause."</p>
               <p>"It is; and if we but succeed as well for five years to come as we have for five
                  years past, <emph>America is our own;</emph> here we will raise the standard of
                  the Church triumphant; here we will found an empire which shall subdue the
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Your projects are grand; but your Eminence will excuse me if I doubt their
                  practicability."</p>
               <p>"You do not know our resources, or our power, Mr. Arnold. <emph>One</emph>, who
                  has been, and is a prominent candidate for the Presidency of the United States, is
                     <emph>bound</emph> with us; yes, an avowed servant and follower of the Church.
                     <emph>We can elect him</emph>. When the time comes which policy dictates, we
                  will. Then, when all offices of emolument and trust are in our gift, we shall have
                  the whole nation in our power. Yes, sir—I repeat it, America will yet be the
                  empire of the church."</p>
               <p>"Not if such men as Cramer exist, to arouse Americans to their danger; to lead
                  them on in opposition, aye, even to battle, if necessity requires it, to oppose
                  your designs."</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6961-00000082"/>
               <p>The priest smiled sarcastically. "We have," said he, "means of ridding ourselves
                  of such as he. We will not long allow such obstacles to remain in the path of our
                  progress. He would have died long ago, did not policy dictate a different
                  course."</p>
               <p>"Your Eminence best knows the surest mode of action. But it is necessary to those
                  whom I serve, that he should soon be disposed of. Every day he adds to the danger
                  of their position. There are laws, which, if <emph>enforced</emph>, will consign
                  them to a dreary prison; all we fear is, that he will <emph>force</emph> the
                  officers of the law to act against us. The will of the people is powerful; if once
                  excited against us, our harvest is over. If once crushed, we cannot rise
                  again."</p>
               <p>"That is true But you need not be crushed. We will soon hold him in check. He is
                  but a man, and I have three temptations laid before him. There are
                     <emph>three</emph>, and if he can escape from <emph>all</emph>, he is
                     <emph>more</emph> than man."</p>
               <p>"If your Eminence pleases, may I understand what these are? If one is wealth, I
                  can say that—"</p>
               <p>"He cares not for money. You are right there," said the priest, interrupting him.
                  "His talent makes him a handsome living; he has not a miserly drop of blood in his
                  veins; therefore, money beyond his mere present necessity, is no object to him.
                  But he has warm blood in his veins; he is an <emph>adorer</emph> of beauty in all
                  its shapes, and I have placed three sirens around him. Two are yet unconscious of
                  my aim, and are yet pure and innocent as unfledged doves; the third is
                  surpassingly beautiful, and to her beauty is added a power of fascination which
                  few possess; an artful coquetry which would conquer an anchorite."</p>
               <p>"But rumor says that Cramer is soon to wed! I heard this morning from a friend of
                  his, to whom he introduced me a short time since, that he is to be married very
                  soon!"</p>
               <p>A shade of disappointment flitted across the face of the priest, but it passed
                  away as the shadow of a flitting cloud leaves the earth, and a sarcastic smile
                  replaced it.</p>
               <p>"So much the better!" he added. "We can the easier destroy him; even should he
                  fail to fall before the arts of our tools, we can<emph>create</emph> a jealousy
                  which will destroy his domestic happiness, and that, to a mind constituted like
                  his, will be a shock which <emph>must</emph> produce insanity."</p>
               <p>"Your Eminence seems to be foiled by nothing. Your active mind prepares a remedy
                  for every failure; a point for every exigency."</p>
               <p>"A good general is ever prepared for all vicissitudes; ready for every change in
                  his mode of attack. But who is he to marry?"</p>
               <p>"A Miss Clifford, the daughter of one of our wealthy merchant princes."</p>
               <p>"Ah! then we must entangle him, and win some of his wealth, too, while we are
                  about it. He will, of course, receive a large settlement?"</p>
               <p>"He has refused it, I hear. He told the father of the lady, upon asking his
                  daughter's hand, that he did not wish anything but her; he was able from his
                  profession to support her in good style, and utterly refused the settlement which
                  the <emph>liberal</emph> old gentleman offered, and when the latter urged the
                  matter, bade him settle it exclusively on her and her children."</p>
               <p>"Have you any idea when they are to be married?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; on the coming Sabbath, in Grace Church, of which her parents are
                  members."</p>
               <p>"It is a pity things were not a little more advanced. I could at once crush his
                  hopes, and strike a death-blow to his reputation. I could have the 'wronged widow'
                     <emph>Montrose</emph> (the lady I have alluded to as the coquette) rush into
                  the Church, forbid the marriage, swoon away—then let a suit for
                     <unclear>breach</unclear> of promise and seduction follow, and I would conquer,
                  in spite of him."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Widows</emph> are not often seduced," said Arnold, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"True, more often are they the seducers; but that portion of community generally
                  selected to serve on juries, couldn't be made to believe so. But it matters not;
                  through his wife we can strike the deadliest blow at his hopes and happiness. When
                  fame and fortune seem within his grasp—when his heart revels in the happiness of
                  love—when he is a father and a husband—then we can, with one<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000083"/> blow, dash him to earth, crush him forever, body
                  and heart. Aye, we will place him in a position where he will cast life away as
                  worthless,—scorn to take that as a boon which only adds to the weight of his
                  misery."</p>
               <p>"Your Eminence is indeed a master at planning! But this man may do much harm in
                  all this time!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but in his undoing, we will undo the harm that he has done. So terrible will
                  be his fate, that it will terrify others from ever attempting to follow his
                  course."</p>
               <p>"I leave all to the superior judgment of your Eminence. Have you any further
                  directions for my guidance?"</p>
               <p>"None, until you have joined their Order; then come to me at once, and bring me
                  copies of their Rules. I wish to examine them."</p>
               <p>"I will obey your Eminence."</p>
               <p>As Arnold rose to retire, the servant again entered, and handed two cards to his
                  Eminence. Glancing at them, the latter asked:</p>
               <p>"Are these ladies together?"</p>
               <p>"No, Eminence. The lady Gulietta is in the Blue Room."</p>
               <p>"Neither is aware that the other is here?"</p>
               <p>"No, Eminence."</p>
               <p>"It is well; say to the lady Gulietta that I am engaged, but will soon see her.
                  Admit the other lady, after seeing this gentleman to the door."</p>
               <p>The servant bowed, and accompanied by Arnold, left the room He returned in a few
                  moments, and ushered in the widow Laurel. She blushed deeply as she came in, and
                  deeper still when his Eminence arose, and grasping <unclear>her</unclear> warmly
                  by her hand, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I am delighted to see you, daughter! To what good fortune am I indebted for a
                  visit from you this morning?"</p>
               <p>"I came, Eminence, to inform you of something which I feared might be of
                  interest."</p>
               <p>"Ah—what is it?"</p>
               <p>"My boarder, Mr. Cramer, is going to get married!"</p>
               <p>"That is no news to me, lady!"</p>
               <p>"Why, your Eminence, I thought no one but my daughter knew it!"</p>
               <p>"I keep a close watch over the enemies of the Church, daughter Little occurs in
                  connection with them that I do not find out. I wish him to marry—it will further
                  my wishes. But how does it affect your daughter?"</p>
               <p>"She feels it deeply, Eminence. She seems to adore him!"</p>
               <p>"It is well! She must be the means of his punishment. She is very beautiful—he is
                  but a man—she must yet win him from the path of rectitude. You will send her to
                  me, daughter, upon your return home; and mark me, I shall give her instructions.
                  Do you see that she fulfils them!"</p>
               <p>"She wishes to take the veil, Eminence."</p>
               <p>"Poh—that must not be! I will soon convince her of the folly of that step. She
                  shall yet win the love of him who now spurns her love; and when it is won, then
                  shall she punish him for the church. But of that and my plans when I see her. How
                  fares it with your Southern lady-boarder?"</p>
               <p>"She is a very agreeable lady, Eminence. Pays liberally, and gives me but little
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>"Does she seem sociable, lively, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence—she is gay as a lark!"</p>
               <p>"Something of a coquette, as all of you pretty widows are!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence!" said the widow, blushing deeper still, as the priest
                     <unclear>laid</unclear> his hand carelessly upon her very white shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Come, answer me! Does she seem to be looking for a husband?"</p>
               <p>"She was, when she first arrived, very attentive to Mr. Cramer, out now she seems
                  to have no eye or ear except for his handsome friend, Lieutenant Hilton."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the priest with a frown. "And this Hilton, does he return her
                  passion?"</p>
               <p>"No, Eminence—he is in love with my daughter, and she, like a little fool, will
                  not listen to him. He asked her of me in marriage; and as he is well off, and of
                  good reputation, should have had my consent, had she not refused him."</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6961-00000084"/>
               <p>"She acted wisely. I must see her—send her hither this evening!"</p>
               <p>"It shall be as you desire—but, Eminence—"</p>
               <p>"Well, what would you say? Do not hesitate, if you have aught to say to me!"</p>
               <p>The widow blushed, bent her eyes to the floor, and stammered:</p>
               <p>"Will your Eminence please remember that she is my only child!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes, you need not fear for her, daughter! I have a higher aim for her—she has
                  a duty to perform for the church. Now adieu—I have other visitors to see!"</p>
               <p>After kissing her upon the forehead, the priest escorted her to the door. Calling
                  the servant after she had gone, he bade him admit the lady Gulietta.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the lady came in, looking as queenly as ever, in her robes of
                  half mourning. Hurrying forward, she bent her head low to the extended hand of the
                  priest, and kissed it warmly.</p>
               <p>"Well, daughter," said the priest, "how fares it with thee? Why didst thou not
                  bring with thee an escort in thy new lover?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>New lover!</emph>—ah! your Eminence means Mr. Cramer. His heart is hard as
                  a stone. I can produce no effect on him."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the 'effect' or the effort for an effect has been made more successfully
                  on Lieutenant Hilton!"</p>
               <p>The lady colored—look confused, and then murmured:</p>
               <p>"I do not understand your Eminence!"</p>
               <p>"Then I must speak more plainly, Gulietta. I sent you to endeavor to win Ernest
                  Cramer's love."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, and I tried in vain to attract the slightest attention from him.
                  He already loved another before I met him. I learned from my maid but yesternight
                  that he is soon to be married."</p>
               <p>"And deeming his case hopeless, thought it not imprudent to fall in love with his
                  handsome companion!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, some one has been slandering me in your ears!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, child! it is not slander to say that a woman loves. It is a compliment, if
                  she loves with good taste. Upon a second thought, I approve of this taste of
                  yours. I am content that you should love this young officer. Marry him, if you
                  can—if you cannot, lead him on until he makes you his mistress. Through him, we
                  can learn Cramer's secrets. Now, Gulietta, see that you fail not—be sure that you
                  win him."</p>
               <p>"Eminence, I will try," said the lovely woman. If the daughter of my landlady was
                  not there, I could succeed; but <unclear>he</unclear> seems to be enchanted with
                  her."</p>
               <p>"She will be removed soon, and you will have <unclear>no</unclear> competitor. But
                  you must use your influence to keep him boarding at Mrs. Laurel's, for I presume
                  that Cramer will keep his own establishment, after marriage."</p>
               <p>"I think he will not, your Eminence. He told Desca, my maid, that he should take
                  the floor above that which he now occupies, and refurnish it, upon his
                  marriage."</p>
               <p>"Ah! so much the better. Then Lizzie will remain where she is. You must put all
                  your arts into action—Hilton must be won."</p>
               <p>"He shall—or he shall not slight me with impunity!" said Gulietta, as her dark eye
                  flashed proudly. Then, as a sudden thought seemed to pass across the mirror of her
                  mind, she asked: "How is it that your Eminence becomes so well acquainted with my
                  actions and feelings?"</p>
               <p>"Have I not often told you, Gulietta, that no secret can be hidden from me; that
                  my eye is ever on the servants of the church?"</p>
               <p>"True, your Excellency. But pleased as I have been with Mr. Hilton, I have neither
                  by word or act revealed it."</p>
               <p>"You err, my child. While speaking to Cramer, your words have been meant for his
                  friend; your eyes have rested upon his martial form; and I knew some time since
                  all that I have told you at this interview."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Eminence: a woman's will can always be swayed by her heart."</p>
               <p>"Your acts have not disaccorded with my design, daughter. But you must report more
                  often. Push on as rapidly as you can, and with this Hilton win the circle of your
                  sway."</p>
               <p>"I will obey your Eminence."</p>
               <p>"It is well, daughter. Now, go; I have many letters to reply to."</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6961-00000085"/>
               <p>Again the priest was alone. A mocking smile was on his face, "Tools, tools," he
                  muttered; "what are they without a master-mind and skilful hand to guide
                  them."</p>
               <p>Rising again, he recalled Allie, his fair amanuensis, from the ante-room, and
                  resumed the occupation in which we found him at the commencement of this

               <p>"HARRY, we've fun afloat for to-night. Get your pistols, and put on this sailor's
                  dress; it is a match to mine."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Ernest? Are you going on a scout to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have just heard of something. A mystery is involved, and I must unravel
                  it."</p>
               <p>Thus spoke Cramer, as Hilton came into the room, about nine o'clock in the
                  evening.</p>
               <p>"A <emph>mystery?</emph> What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly a mystery; but something wrong is going on in a certain quarter, and
                  I have been called on for help. A police officer is waiting for us; come, hurry:
                  the time is up when I was to meet him."</p>
               <p>"I'll be ready in a minute, then!" said Hilton, hurrying to dress.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes Hilton was dressed precisely like Cramer, their apparel being the
                  same as that of regular men-o'wars-men; blue jackets and trowsers—tarpaulin hats,
                  &amp;c. In addition to these, Hilton concealed a brace of pistols under the blue
                  collared frock which he wore over his ordinary shirt, while Cramer put his
                  favorite old Colt revolver in one pocket, and buckled a belt containing a curved
                  dagger or Turkish knife, of Damascene steel, around his waist. Thus accoutred,
                  each put on a rough pea-jacket of pilot-cloth, also ornamented like their other
                  clothes with a sailor-like profusion of guilt navy buttons, and then they sallied
                  out.</p>
               <p>"Now, Ernest," said Hilton, after they reached the street, "let me know what you
                  are up to. When I'm on duty I like to know what's ahead."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll tell you in a few words, Harry, as much I know myself. You was present
                  this afternoon when an old lady called upon me?"</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6961-00000086"/>
               <p>"Yes, you mean a lady dressed in deep black?"</p>
               <p>"The same! Well, she is a widow. She has an only daughter, who will be heir to all
                  her property, which is immense. <emph>She</emph>, the widow, <emph>was</emph> a
                  Catholic, but she has been recently converted under the ministration of that noble
                  and eloquent man of God, the Rev. Mr. R—, of the Stanton-street Baptist Church.
                  Her daughter was at this time at a female Jesuit Seminary in Ireland, whither the
                  mother had been persuaded by her confessor to send her. But upon her conversion,
                  she sent for her child to return, and the latter was reported to have sailed in
                  the B—, a Liverpool Packet, for this port. On the arrival of the vessel, the widow
                  is informed that her daughter, died on the passage, and was buried at sea. This
                     <emph>she</emph> doubts, because a priest, pretending to be a layman, but
                     <emph>really</emph> a priest and a <emph>Jesuit</emph>, came over as the girl's
                  protector. She feels certain that her daughter is yet living, and is detained by
                  the Jesuits, under a wish to get the property through her. From sundry mysterious
                  conduct between the Catholic first-mate of this ship and the priest alluded to,
                  she has an idea that the whereabouts of the girl is known to this mate, in fact
                  that he, with the consent of the priest, has concealed her, and for his services
                  thus rendered, is to be rewarded at a fearful sacrifice to the poor girl and her
                  distracted mother. <emph>Now</emph>, I cannot explain to you <emph>how</emph> I
                  became acquainted with a certain fact, but let the fact suffice. There is a
                  society or association in this city formed entirely of sea-going men, who have a
                  large establishment devoted to their service, where they meet for pleasure
                  whenever they get into port. They have their pass-words and countersigns, and no
                  one can enter without these. When once admitted, the visitor can get anything
                  which money can purchase, for his money. To this place, it is supposed by me, that
                  this poor girl has been carried."</p>
               <p>"Can <emph>you</emph> get admittance?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have been there repeatedly. I have the pass and countersign, both of which
                  I shall give to you and the police officer whom I have selected to assist me, for
                  we must enter singly and at different times, and then unite in the grand
                  ball-room."</p>
               <p>"Jupiter, what a romantic life you lead, Ernest! Is this girl pretty?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know. I have never seen her."</p>
               <p>"What is her name? Is that pretty?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you think that IRENE is pretty."</p>
               <p>"It is. But where are you going now—not to the Points?"</p>
               <p>"No; but we will find the officer who is to go with us in Elmstreet. His name is
                  Smith, a common name, but he is an uncommon man."</p>
               <p>"Who is this rascally mate that you speak of?"</p>
               <p>"His name is <hi rend="i"/>Rutherford, the bastard son of an Irish sea captain,
                  who follows the sea because he is fit for nothing else."</p>
               <p>"And the priest?"</p>
               <p>"He rejoices in the cognomen of Morrison, but that is not his true name. His real
                  name is <hi rend="i"/>Lynch."</p>
               <p>At this moment, Cramer halted before a brick house in Elmstreet, near the
                  Tombs.</p>
               <p>"Stay here a moment," said he to Hilton. "I'll call Smith out."</p>
               <p>Stepping to the door, he pulled a bell, which at each pull gave but a single
                  sound, like the engine bell of a steamer. This bell he pulled ten times. While the
                  sound of the tenth stroke yet vibrated, the door opened, and a man appeared. By
                  the light of the street lamp in front of the door, Hilton could see that this
                  person was also disguised as a sailor like themselves."</p>
               <p>"Is that you, Mr. Cramer?" asked the man drawing a watch from his pocket to note
                  the hour.</p>
               <p>"Yes; am I not punctual, friend Smith?"</p>
               <p>"True to a minute," replied the officer; "and <emph>I</emph> am ready."</p>
               <p>Saying this, he descended to the street.</p>
               <p>"My friend and room-mate, Mr. Hilton, Mr. Smith," said Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Glad to know you, sir. Let's go into the Ivy Green and take a stiffener before we
                  start," said Smith.</p>
               <p>"Won't some one recognise you there?" asked Cramer. "We must be very cautious
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>"I'm aware of that. But my own wife, bless her pure heart,<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000087"/> wouldn't know me now. Look at me here in the
                  lamplight—would <emph>you</emph> know me now?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I wouldn't. Have you a wig on?"</p>
               <p>"No; but I've put an easily-removed dye upon my grey hair: I've paled my rosy
                  cheeks, and darkened my eye-brows."</p>
               <p>"Well, you're disguise is good, I must acknowledge—your most intimate friends
                  would never know you."</p>
               <p>"Then come along—we'll <emph>smile</emph>, and then I'm at your command for
                  anything that offers."</p>
               <p>The trio then entered the well-known "Ivy Green," opposite the Tombs; but, reader,
                  we won't go in with them—we'll wait outside till they appear.</p>
               <p>Not more than five minutes elapsed before they came out.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ho! ho!" cried Smith. "That was a great idea! I blackguarded myself, and
                  Nesbitt was going to thrash me for abusing <emph>Smith</emph> behind his back.
                  You're satisfied <emph>now</emph> with my disguise?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, perfectly," replied Cramer. "You act the sailor like an old salt."</p>
               <p>"Well, where are we bound now? You've given me no explanations yet."</p>
               <p>"You've heard of the Seamen's 'M. F. F. and P. Society,' have you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a hundred times, but never could get a trace of it, though we've often been
                  on the lay for some of them, on account of abductions and other matters."</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall to-night introduce you amongst them."</p>
               <p>"The devil! Excuse me, Mr. Cramer, but are you in earnest?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Smith, and as, from your knowledge of the characters of rough and
                  lawless rovers, there is some danger in the adventure, I asked your company to aid
                  Hilton and me in the adventure. I go there to-night to look for a lady. If you
                  deem the expedition too dangerous or risky, you can yet retire."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Mr. Cramer," said the officer, in a tone bordering on the indignant,
                  "did you ever know any thing of a milk-soppish nature about me?"</p>
               <p>"No; if I had, you would not have been selected by me to-night," said Cramer,
                  frankly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, thankee—thankee! I'm not one of the kind that backs down before I'm hurt. I'm
                  always <emph>fixed</emph> for service, like a percussion cap! Which way is this
                  crib?"</p>
               <p>"In South street. We enter by a basement, through a common rum cellar, but when
                  we're once inside, you'll see such sights as don't often meet your eyes."</p>
               <p>"Nice, eh?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Nice</emph>—the furniture of the establishment, so far as I've seen it,
                  never cost less than a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>"<emph>The</emph> deuce! It <emph>must</emph> be nice! Is it above Fulton?"</p>
               <p>"No—below. We may as well go down Nassau to Fulton and then turn down I'll explain
                  matters as I go along."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
               <p>IN a chamber, most magnificently furnished, a female was seated by the side of a
                  centre table, upon which an astral lamp, shaded by a pictured shade, was placed.
                  Her head was bowed upon her hands, which were upon the table, and the rich locks
                  of dark brown hair lay in curling masses upon the table, and over her fair neck
                  and shoulders. Her form seemed to be of an exquisite mould; her shoulders were
                  left exposed by her low dress; and where the hair was parted away, were white as
                  alabaster, and very plump and graceful.</p>
               <p>The room was evidently a bed-chamber, for in a little alcove, or ante-room, which
                  had no door, gorgeous curtains of crimson velvet, relieved by inner curtains of
                  lace, could be seen. In another corner of the room, a marble bathing-tub, with
                  "Croton-fixtures" attached, could be seen, and near it a toilet-table and a
                  pier-glass, extending from the floor to the ceiling of the room. The furniture was
                  rich, but of a too voluptuous cast for gentility. The sofas and ottomans were
                  cushioned with crimson velvet; the chairs were cushioned with the same material. A
                  very rich but gaudy carpet was on the floor—a carpet so soft that no footsteps in
                  crossing it need be heard. Pictures there were on the walls; paintings of old
                  masters, but these were also of a class bordering on the obscene. The unwilling
                  wedding of the Sabines was one subject; Venus and Adonis another; and still
                  another was that of Hero receiving Leander, as he came nude and dripping from the
                  angry waters of the Hellespont.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the sound of heavy steps, appearing to be approaching the door, was
                  heard. The female raised her head from the table. Oh! what a spiritual beauty was
                  pictured in her countenance. Her eyes were of that hue so deeply, darkly blue,
                  that when they sparkled you would think them black; her cheek was pale, yet it was
                  so transparent that you could trace each vein beneath the skin. Her features were
                  Grecian—regular, as if drawn as an ideal of beauty, by some love-lorn,
                  enthusiastic artist, whose talent was equal to his maddening enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>A look of anxiety, not unmingled with an expression of fear, gathered upon her
                  lovely face, as she heard the steps approach the door. A key was inserted in the
                  door from the outside. Was she a prisoner? The door opened, and a man entered,
                  who, taking the key from the outside, placed it inside, locked the door, and
                  returned it to his pocket. The young girl, after seeing who her visitor was, again
                  dropped her head upon her hands, as before. The man stood and looked at her, with
                  his arms folded upon his breast, and a sneering smile upon his face.</p>
               <p>To look at him, you would suppose him to be twenty-eight or thirty years of age.
                  He was rather tall, of passable figure, though premature dissipation had rendered
                  it slim and somewhat bent. His face was rather cadaverous from the same cause. His
                  hair was a dull, rusty black—a singular color, produced by <emph>dye</emph>, for
                  its natural color was <emph>red</emph>. He had extensive whiskers and imperial, of
                  the same color His dress was of the "flash genteel" order, and he had the look of
                  one who would be a dandy if he only knew how. His countenance was expressive of
                  vanity and superciliousness; he looked like one of those cowardly wretches who are
                  always open to anything which is not dangerous; one of those things who would whip
                  a child to death, or strike a woman, because they are weaker than he—who would lie
                  or steal, when either could be done with impunity, but who would run like a kicked
                  cur, from the slightest sound of danger or retribution.</p>
               <p>He stood by the door a moment, then advanced by the side of the girl. A shudder
                  passed through her form as she intuitively felt his nearer approach, for his steps
                  could not be heard on the yielding carpet.</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Irene," said he, in a haughty tone, "have you made up your mind to my
                  proposition? Are you ready to become Mrs. Rutherford to-night, eh, my fair
                  one?"</p>
               <p>"If you are a <emph>man</emph>, take me home to my mother, as you promised.<pb
                     n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6961-00000089"/> when you pretended to rescue me from
                  that villain Morrison!" replied the girl, indignantly, raising her head, and
                  darting upon him a look fiery with scorn and anger.</p>
               <p>"Your mother thinks you are dead, girl."</p>
               <p>"Then so much the more need of my hastening to her side."</p>
               <p>"Poh! she'd think you were a ghost. I myself told her to-day that I saw you buried
                  at sea."</p>
               <p>"Monster! Wretch!"</p>
               <p>"Spare your compliments, my dear, and give me an answer. My patience is nearly
                  exhausted, and remember, you are in my power! No help can reach you!"</p>
               <p>"Hark! I hear music. Oh, my God, that I could escape hence!" answered the
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"You cannot, girl, you cannot. That music is in the Grand Ball-Room of the society
                  to which I belong. No one there would help you, were your screams for aid to reach
                  their ears, which is impossible. No <emph>brother</emph> with <emph>us</emph>,
                  interferes with the pleasures or arrangements of another brother. It is now eleven
                  o'clock. The ball has commenced below. If you will be my bride, the priest shall
                  be called at once; in fifteen minutes the ceremony will be over, and I'll take you
                  down to the Ball Room, where you shall see more beauty and chivalry in an hour,
                  than you ever before saw in your life-time. Come, what say you?"</p>
               <p>"You would not <emph>force</emph> me to marry you. I hate you; you do not love
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know about that last. You're confounded pretty—and then you are
                  heiress to a <emph>fortune</emph> that would make me more than independent for
                  life, extravagant as I am. I have <emph>something</emph> of an inclination for
                     <emph>you</emph>, and a decided and determined inclination to be master of your
                     <emph>fortune!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then Sir, hear my reply to your proposals. I would rather <emph>die</emph> than
                  be your wife."</p>
               <p>"Then you prefer being my mistress, for mistress or wife to me you
                     <emph>shall</emph> be, and that before sleep visits my eyelids."</p>
               <p>"Never! Never so help me Almighty God!" cried the fair girl rising, and displaying
                  a form above the medium height—lithe and graceful as the swaying poplar.</p>
               <p>"You cannot help yourself!" said the unmanly wretch with a sneer. "If you dare to
                  resist my will, force shall soon subdue you."</p>
               <p>As he said this, he reached forward his arms to encircle her waist. With a bound
                  she sprang back from his loathsome touch, and in a tone hoarse from excitement
                  cried:</p>
               <p>"Stand off—stand off, you coward. Lay not your dastard hands on me, or I'll rend
                  your eyes from your false face. I am but a <emph>woman</emph>, yet I am not the
                  weakest of my sex. I do not faint at danger, and drop helpless into the arms of a
                  wretch like you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how magnificent did she look in her anger! The color had rushed in a ruby
                  flood into her cheek and mantled her lofty brow. Her eyes, dilated and brilliant
                  with anger, conveyed more intense meaning than her words. Her voluptuous bosom
                  rose and fell like the fitful waves of the ocean when aroused by a sudden storm.
                  Her tall form quivered and seemed to expand with excitement.</p>
               <p>For a moment her unmanly persecutor hesitated. He turned pale; he seemed, like a
                  craven wretch as he was, to fear that weak unarmed girl—he whose strength was
                  tenfold that of hers. A moment thus <choice>
                     <sic>he he</sic>
                     <corr>he</corr>
                  </choice> hesitated, and then gathering courage he advanced toward her. She
                  retreated to a corner of the room and as he followed she raised a chair and
                  endeavored to strike him. But ere she had lifted it high enough to let it descend,
                  he caught it with his right hand, wrenched it from her, and with his left arm
                  clasped her waist. With all her force she dashed her clenched right hand into his
                  face, while with the nails of her left she ploughed four deep furrows along his
                  pale cheek, leaving blood where they passed. Then the unmanly wretch struck her a
                  heavy blow with his fist, which for a moment stunned her and covered her fair face
                  with the blood which spouted from her quivering nostrils. Ere she could recover,
                  the villain had torn a silken scarf from her shoulders and pinioned her hands.
                  Alas—then she <emph>was</emph> helpless. Bearing her to a sofa, he seated her on
                  his knee and imprinted a burning kiss upon the bosom which was already spotted
                  with her blood.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6961-00000090"/>
               <p>Wild, wild and terribly shrill and piercing was her shriek as she felt his fiery
                  lips pressed upon her quivering form.</p>
               <p>"Scream on, fair fool!" he laughed—"scream on; you can get no help."</p>
               <p>But, at the very instant, ere the scream or the kiss was repeated, the door, which
                  he had locked, was dashed in, and the wretched girl saw several men rushing toward
                  her. Rutherford arose, and cried, "Hold, brothers, hold; remember the rules of our
                  association."</p>
               <p>"Brother be d—d!" shouted Smith. "Do you see this, you white-livered dog!"
                  exhibiting as he spoke, the star of the New York police.</p>
               <p>"To the rescue! To the rescue! Treason!—police in the house!" shouted
                  Rutherford.</p>
               <p>"Harry, bear off the lady: see, her hands are bound—carry her off!" cried Cramer,
                  at the same time giving Rutherford a kick on the stomach which completely doubled
                  him up, and scientifically planting a blow behind his ear as he bent forward,
                  which laid him stiff on the soft carpet.</p>
               <p>"We must be quick, there's more coming!" said Smith: out with your tools, boys,
                  and be ready for a fight."</p>
               <p>"Harry, can you carry her?—she has fainted!" cried Cramer. "Take her in your arms:
                  Smith and me will clear the way."</p>
               <p>In an instant more they had left the room, Hilton, as directed, raising the lovely
                  form of the girl in his arms. Rutherford began to recover a moment after, and as
                  he heard the sound of pistol shots below, rose to his feet, staggered as far as
                  the table, and there stood and listened.</p>
               <p>"Lost her, lost her sure as there's a hell, if they don't kill them and stop her
                  below!" he muttered. "How in earth did they ever get in!—who were they."</p>
               <p>He heard but three or four shots fired, then for a moment all was still.</p>
               <p>"I don't like to go down there. There may be more of them, and a chance for a
                  bullet instead of a knock-down!" muttered the cowardly whelp. "I'd like to know
                  how things have gone"</p>
               <p>Hasty footsteps were heard approaching. Rutherford turned pale as they came
                  nearer, and after a few moment's hesitation, ran for the bed-room before spoken
                  of. Before he could reach it, however, he heard his name called, and recognised
                  the voice of the speaker.</p>
               <p>"Is that you, Morrison?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes; in the name of God what have you been about! Is Irene Montressor gone?"—</p>
               <p>"Yes, unless you have stopped her below!"</p>
               <p>"Two of our men, the door-keeper, and Captain Scarn, of the Revolter, are
                  stretched out with lead in them. I got a knock-down from a policeman's club, and
                  they are all safely beyond our reach!" replied Morrison.</p>
               <p>"Curse such luck! How did they get in?"</p>
               <p>"God only knows! The door-keeper is dying, but he swears that every man who has
                  entered to-night has had the <unclear>pass-word</unclear> and countersign."</p>
               <p>"Then, there has been some treachery!"</p>
               <p>"Treachery there has been!" cried another person, entering <choice>
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> room; "for here is a pocket-book dropped in the scuffle, and the name of
                  'ERNEST CRAMER' is written inside of it."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ernest Cramer!</emph> the enemy of our holy and infallible Church!" groaned
                  Morrison, the priest.</p>
               <p>"By the God who made me, he shall die for balking my aim!" muttered
                  Rutherford.</p>
               <p>For the residue, and a satisfactory ending of that night's adventure, we must
                  change the scene.</p>
               <p>Behold a picture! In a small parlor, neatly, but not gaudily furnished, a lady was
                  seated beside a table, reading. She was evidently past the meridian of
                  life—probably fifty years had passed since she first drew breath in this world of
                  woe and pleasure, sin and sorrow, luxury and want. Grey hairs had begun to steal
                  in among her dark hair, which was mostly covered by a neat white cap, which gave
                  her a matronly look. Her dress was deep black, but of fine<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000091"/> material, and her appearance indicated that she was
                  not one of those unfortunates who, when widowed by the decree of Providence, are
                  wedded to bitter, biting poverty. Her features were good, and the expression of
                  her countenance was noble and dignified. Yet there was a look of settled sorrow
                  resting there, a look of unutterable grief, but it was calm—calm as the shadow of
                  a rock upon the waters of a lake unrippled by a breeze.</p>
               <p>She was reading aloud, from the Scriptures—reading that touching and most
                  beautiful Psalm of David which commences thus—Bow down thy ear, O Lord: hear me,
                  for I am poor and needy!" After she had read it, she arose, and with a deep sigh,
                  murmured—"God is good and just—may HE give me strength to bear my affliction. Like
                  the inspired Psalmist, I will pray for His aid."</p>
               <p>Kneeling, with her hands pressed upon the sacred book which she had been reading,
                  in a deep, tremulous tone—tremulous as if with reverential awe and respect for the
                  Mighty Being whom she addressed—she prayed:</p>
               <p>"THOU who art the God of the widow—the Father of the fatherless—THOU who lookest
                  down upon and carest for the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, the brutes of
                  the forest, and even the worms of the earth—THOU who feedest the sparrow and
                  carest also for sinful mortals—THOU who doest all things wisely—hear me, I beseech
                  thee! If my child yet lives, O protect her—suffer not the enemies of the law to
                  overcome her and bring her to death, or worse than death! Spare, O Lord, spare the
                  last hope and comfort of the widow! And if she be passed away—if she be beyond the
                  help of this world, and past its ills, make me thankful that THOU hast taken her,
                  for THY will is good—let it be done now and forever,—Amen!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!" said another voice at the door, which stood ajar.</p>
               <p>The lady started to her feet with a scream of surprise. Ernest Cramer appeared on
                  the threshold.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Montressor, if I alarmed you," he said, in a low tone. "The
                  servant said you were in the parlor, therefore I came without announcement."</p>
               <p>"Have you heard any news of my child, Mr. Cramer? Oh, I<emph>know</emph> you have,
                  or you would not visit me at this late hour! Speak—I can bear it—is she living or
                  dead?"</p>
               <p>"Be calm, madam, she is living, and I hope you will soon see her!"</p>
               <p>"Where—oh, where is she? Tell me, that I may fly to her side. I care not where it
                  is, they shall not keep her from me!"</p>
               <p>"She will be by your side before long; but, madam, I pray you to be
                  comforted."</p>
               <p>"I am! Tell me all, Mr. Cramer, tell me all! Is Irene in safety—will she be
                  restored to me? Tell me, that I may see her once more, and I will thank God and
                  die!"</p>
               <p>"You must not speak of dying now, Mrs. Montressor! You are needed as a guardian
                  more than ever to your beautiful daughter, who, in her womanly beauty, is exposed,
                  in a cold and bitter world, to many a danger. But now that you are calm and
                  composed, I will bring her in."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Bring her in!</emph> What do you mean? Is she <emph>so</emph> near?" gasped
                  the mother.</p>
               <p>The reply came from the lips of the lovely girl herself. As Cramer stepped aside,
                  she bounded in, and her mother's arms were open to receive her. There are scenes
                  too happy and too sacred to be intruded upon by a third party. This is one. We
                  will leave the mother and daughter alone for a while.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>IT was the morning following the night of the last described adventure. "His
                  Eminence," in a rich dressing gown of scarlet velvet, was breakfasting
                  fashionably—that is, lounging on the side of his bed, and taking his coffee from
                  the hands of a servant, who held out a silver salver containing the
                     <emph>materials</emph>. He had just set down the small porcelain cup which he
                  had drained of the clear essence of the mocha berry, when his chamber door was
                  opened, and his confidential servant entered. The brow of "His Eminence" grew
                  darker</p>
               <p>"What," he cried, languidly—"what is wanting so early, Dennis?"</p>
               <p>"A call, your Eminence—he says he must see you immediately."</p>
               <p>"<emph>He?</emph> Who?"</p>
               <p>"The dark-complexioned brother who came here yesterday afternoon, Eminence."</p>
               <p>"What, Father Morrison?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, the same—he is very urgent."</p>
               <p>"Admit him—take away these things!"</p>
               <p>In a moment more, Morrison entered. A dark streak reaching from his temples across
                  his cheek, blue and discolored, showed that Mr. Smith, on the evening before, had
                  left his mark on him.</p>
               <p>"What is the cause of your early visit, son?" asked the priest, rather tartly.</p>
               <p>"I would not come without good cause to disturb the morning meditations of your
                  Eminence!" replied Morrison. "But I needed advice. Our prize, she whom you have
                  placed under my care, and she whom I brought in safety across the ocean, has been
                  rescued—has been torn from my custody!"</p>
               <p>"Fool! What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"I defended her—endeavored to keep her; but see this scar! I was knocked
                  senseless; and ere were three of them!"</p>
               <p>"Of <emph>them!</emph> Who were they?"</p>
               <p>Morrison drew forth the small pocket-book which was alluded to in the last
                  chapter, and handed it to the priest.</p>
               <p>"ERNEST CRAMER!" cried the latter, as he read the name. "The maledictions of St.
                  Patrick be on him! He seems doomed to foil us in every point. How came
                     <emph>he</emph> to know of this matter?"</p>
               <p>"Heaven only knows!" replied Morrison. "I thought she was as safe as if she had
                  been in the cells of our sister Ursula."</p>
               <p>"Would to God she had been—there will trouble come of this!" muttered his
                  Eminence. "This Cramer must be crushed—he must be stopped—he is becoming too
                  daring and too annoying. He thwarts us in every aim."</p>
               <p>"Leave him to me, Eminence. I will repair my last fault, and make up for her loss,
                  by placing him where he can act no more against us."</p>
               <p>"She is <emph>not</emph> lost—she must be regained! Think you that she has been
                  restored to her mother?"</p>
               <p>"Of course."</p>
               <p>"Curses upon her! She shall not long be with her! Morrison, if you would not be
                  tried for your neglect before the "Twenty Four," I warn you that you must recover
                  her! Use money—scruple at nothing, but recover her. Do it, though you have to
                  plant your dagger in her mother's heart!"</p>
               <p>"And in <emph>Cramer's!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No! he must not be killed <emph>yet</emph>—leave him to me! I will
                     <emph>act</emph> in his case!"</p>
               <p>"I will obey, Eminence."</p>
               <p>"Do—and if you would ever again win favor from me, secure the person of that girl
                  again. Through her, and her alone, can we get the vast property that is needed by
                  the treasury of the Holy Church more than it is needed by her. We will take care
                  of <emph>her</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Eminence, I will obey. Your pardon and your blessing!"</p>
               <p>"Neither shall be given before I see that girl once more in the power of the
                  Church."</p>
               <p>Again "his Eminence" was alone "It is strange—it is strange!"<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000093"/> he muttered—"how this mere boy in years—this single
                     <emph>one</emph>—can do so much against a power which has uncrowned emperors
                  and desolated kingdoms. God must help him—God must help him! Yet <emph>art</emph>
                  can conquer—I will set yet another trap."</p>
               <p>He rang the bell. The servant came.</p>
               <p>"Send Allie, my fair young Scribe here!" he said.</p>
               <p>The servant bowed, and retired.</p>
               <p>When Allie came into the room, "his Eminence" looked at her for several moments
                  without speaking, or responding to her timid salutation. His gaze caused her to
                  blush slightly, and to cast her beautiful eyes down until the long lashes rested
                  like dark threads of finest, glossiest silk, upon her pale cheek. Oh, how etherial
                  and intellectual did she look—how little of the <emph>animal</emph> was there in
                  her slender but perfect form—how much of <emph>soul</emph> in the expression of
                  her lovely face.</p>
               <p>"Yes," muttered the priest—"yes, she <emph>must</emph> conquer! Mere
                  voluptuousness will never win or betray <emph>him</emph>. Blessed with intellect
                  himself above the common mould, he can only worship <emph>intellect</emph>—full of
                  soul and romance, nothing but a romantic and soulful being can ever attract his
                  gaze from the dreamy visions with which he has surrounded himself in his high
                  imaginings."</p>
               <p>Again he paused. Allie had raised her large meek eyes to his, and stood wondering
                  at words which she could not comprehend. But now he addressed her.</p>
               <p>"Allie," said he, "you know how much I have done for you—how, when you was a
                  feeble, deserted infant, I took you in mine own charge—reared you as tenderly as
                  if you had been my own child—educated you under my own eye—have loved and trusted
                  you as if you were my daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lord!"</p>
               <p>"What would you do for me, in return for all this?"</p>
               <p>"Die, my Lord," said she, in a trembling voice—"die to serve you!"</p>
               <p>"I ask not your death; but I have a work which it seems you alone are gifted
                  enough to succeed in God has given you talent—you are a poet; even as an essayist,
                  in preparing my own sermons, you have rendered <emph>me</emph> famous! With such
                  talent you have a power in this Republic which neither wealth nor high birth can
                  ever rival. And, my child, it is now that you must use it. I know a youth, high in
                  ambitious aspirations, a young man, gifted with a soul and talents like your
                  own—one whose delight it is to hold converse with the mighty secrets of nature—one
                  who in his very youth sought the far off isles of the sea, played with the storm
                  on the ocean and upon the lofty mountain tops, held converse with the muttering
                  thunder, and laughed when the ragged lightning shattered the rocks around him. He
                  has the spirit of the eagle with the tenderness of the dove—the courage of a lion
                  with the kindness of a woman. How would you feel if you knew such a man!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Lord—I could <emph>so love him</emph>—I could live on his smiles, and die
                  when he frowned! I could weep when he wept, sing when he was joyous—go down into
                  his grave, and lie upon his breast when death came to him!" cried the enthusiastic
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"Suppose him to be an enemy to our Church?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I would reason with him, pray for him night and day, pray with him—I would
                     <emph>convert</emph> him to our faith."</p>
               <p>"Then, Allie, you know your task. Such a man there is, and I give you full
                  permission to win and wear him—the only condition being, that you make him a
                  convert. By your pen you must reach his heart; you must draw him within the magic
                  circle of love, by mystery and your beautifully written letters. You must paint
                  for him a creature beautiful, as in truth, thou art, paint her worshiping aye,
                  dying at the altar of his genius. If he has <emph>vanity</emph>, you cannot fail
                  to reach it; if there is romance in his heart, the mystery thrown around you, (for
                  you must conceal your name and all from him, till I bid you unveil,) will fling a
                  chain of interest over him which he cannot break."</p>
               <p>"Eminence—have I ever heard of this man?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sweet Allie, often. You have often written his name."</p>
               <p>"Me, Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child, you have often written the name of Ernest Cramer."</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6961-00000094"/>
               <p>"<emph>He! the heretic?</emph>" cried the girl with astonishment.</p>
               <p>The priest smiled.</p>
               <p>"I told you, child," said he, "that this young man was an enemy to our church—did
                  I not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, but never have I heard you before clothe <emph>him</emph> with
                  such attributes of mind and heart, as you painted but now."</p>
               <p>"Because, child, I was unwilling to do him justice. But you know how he, all
                  alone, has combatted with us, how he has foiled and replied to our best writers.
                  He is a mighty mind—he is <emph>honest</emph> too in his warfare against us, and
                  it is for <emph>you</emph> to convert him and make him as <emph>useful</emph> to
                  us, as now he is dangerous. Oh, Allie, he <emph>will</emph> love you—you alone can
                  win him."</p>
               <p>"I will try, my Lord!" said the sweet girl her brow flushing and her eyes
                  brightening with <choice>
                     <sic>enthusiam</sic>
                     <corr>enthusiasm</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>"Your reward will be great, my daughter. You will remove an enemy to the church,
                  make him its <emph>friend</emph> and <emph>servant</emph>; you will win for
                  yourself a mate that is worthy of you, one who will make earth a paradise to
                  thee."</p>
               <p>A sigh of happiness, of anticipated bliss, quivered on her red lips. Her bosom
                  rose and fell as if with a new feeling. On such a soul as hers the impression of
                  imagined happiness came quick and almost <emph>real</emph>. She loved—even before
                  she knew why or wherefore, loved the picture that the priest, with wily skill and
                  far too heightened coloring, had painted.</p>
               <p>His Eminence smiled. He had touched the right chord. He was proud of his success;
                  he now felt sure of succeeding in his aim.</p>
               <p>"Go child," said he, "go and write a letter to Cramer. Write in terms at once
                  delicate and pure as the breathing of a child, but bold and lofty as the song of
                  an angel. Speak of a love which can worship for years in the dim distance that
                  separates a star from a mortal; tell him of a worship which still is worship when
                  adoration is hopeless. Write in strains of poesy and you <emph>must</emph>
                  succeed."</p>
               <p>"I will—I will!" she cried, and her voice usually so low and timid, rose to a
                  firm, full note of musical sweetness.</p>
               <p>"She will win, and <emph>then</emph> I will destroy <emph>him</emph> and
                     <emph>his</emph>, even if it blasts her—her, <emph>my own child!</emph>" said
                  the priest, with a sneering smile, after she had left the room. "Yes, yes, he
                  cannot escape; if he does, and I am forced to the risk, the dagger or bowl shall
                  finish him. But that must be the <emph>last</emph> resort, for he has friends who
                  would die to avenge him."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
               <p>ERNEST CRAMER and Serena Clifford were seated in the parlor where first they met.
                  Side by side upon a sofa, with one arm around her slender waist, his other hand
                  clasped between both of hers, they sat, gazing fondly into each others' eyes,
                  talking of an event which was to occur at noon on the morrow—at noon on the Holy
                  Sabbath Day—their marriage.</p>
               <p>Do you feel any misgivings now, in regard to our future happiness?" asked Cramer,
                  in a tone deep and low.</p>
               <p>"Ernest, none! Why should I? It is with the full consent of my own family, nay,
                  with their warm <emph>approbation</emph>, that I give you my hand. My own heart's
                  consent was given the first hour we met."</p>
               <p>"But, Serena, I wish you calmly to consider, and not to have love blind you to
                  dangers and difficulties before us. You know how many and bitter are my foes; in
                  my pathway are hidden the sneaking serpents of malice and envy; the hyenas of
                  slander and detraction: I am liable to attacks of every kind."</p>
               <p>"And Ernest, should I be worthy of your love if I should shrink from your side
                  because of these? No—I will heed neither slander or <emph>any</emph> art—I will
                     <emph>ever be the same</emph> in joy or sorrow."</p>
               <p>"Should I meet death, or through some reckless perjury, or conspiracy be doomed to
                  prison?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ernest, I would share your dungeon with you</emph>."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Angel!</emph> Oh! Serena, you have indeed filled a void in this yearning
                  heart of mine, which no other being on <emph>earth</emph> could fill. I am indeed
                  blessed of God, in finding a jewel so rare and precious to hang upon my breast.
                  With you by my side, I will dash onward in the cause of <emph>Right</emph>, with
                  freshened ambition and renewed strength. I will work for <emph>you</emph>, as well
                  as for myself—and for—" here he whispered a low word or two in her ear, at which
                  she blushed, but a rosy smile accompanied the blush. She made no immediate reply,
                  but when a moment afterward he pressed his lips fondly to hers, she all fervently
                  and purely returned the betrothal kiss.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was noon—a Sabbath noon. The busy hum and thunderings of cart-wheels and
                  omnibusses which so deafen one on a week day, in the city, were hushed. Now and
                  then the booming roll of a distant church bell came swelling solemnly on the air,
                  or the quick rattle of the rich man's carriage, as with a blooded team it drove
                  swiftly by, could be heard, but few sounds were heard inside, except the heavy
                  tramp of pedestrians, who moved leisurely along the side-walks.</p>
               <p>In one of the lofty palaces built by <emph>men</emph> to worship GOD in—one of
                  those buildings topped with a steeple, that men may gaze upon from afar off,
                  between two and three hundred people were gathered. From the organ came deep and
                  melodious notes, drawn from its strong lungs by a skilful hand. Through lofty
                  windows of stained glass, a mellow light came in, adding to the solemn look of the
                  place. Those who were seated, scattered here and there in the pews of the vast
                  church, were silent as statues—silent as worshippers, who, at early dawn, bend
                  before the Virgin's shrine, in some ancient cathedral.</p>
               <p>Then, from a room in the rear of the church, came forth a minister, dressed in the
                  white robes of the Episcopal Church. Following him came Ernest Cramer, leading
                  Serena Clifford. She was robed in spotless white; a wreath of orange blossoms
                  twined around her dark brown hair, was the only ornament she wore. Yet she looked
                  beautiful as an angel. She was pale and trembling; but Cramer's step was never
                  more firm, his air never more proud and lofty than then. Behind them came the
                  bridesmaid—a lovely young girl with glossy ringlets, skin like alabaster, and a
                  form graceful as Diana. By her side was a noble-looking young man, the groomsman.
                  Both of these had been selected by Miss Clifford, at Cramer's request; for a
                  sudden call had forced Hilton to hasten on a temporary visit to West Point, on
                  duty, and Cramer had no other intimate friend. In the rear of these followed the
                  family and friends of the bride.</p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6961-00000096"/>
               <p>The minister took his stand before the altar, and before him stood Ernest and
                  Serena, each flanked by their proper attendant.</p>
               <p>Raising his hands, the venerable man of God said—"Kneel, my children—we will ask
                  God's blessing on this solemn ceremony."</p>
               <p>The organ had ceased—not a breath could be heard—not a single sound, save the
                  deep, solemn tones of that white-haired minister These were his words:</p>
               <p>"FATHER, who dwelleth in serene but awful majesty in Heaven, and yet art
                  everywhere—THOU who inspired that Apostle who declared matrimony honorable, look
                  down upon this congregation, and upon these, THY children, who are about to take
                  the holy and solemn vows before THEE and the world. Help THOU them to keep those
                  vows; grant that they may so <emph>live</emph>, that when they die, they may not
                  look back over an ill-spent life. Let this union be registered in Heaven as it is
                  on earth, and may it never be broken, until THOU callest them home. AMEN."</p>
               <p>"Amen," repeated Ernest Cramer. "Amen," sighed the lovely woman at his side.
                  "Amen," said the fond parents of the beautiful bride, in tones quivering with
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>Then they arose. Solemnly the minister put the usual question, if there was any
                  impediment to their marriage, or if any one present could say aught against their
                  union. No one spoke; the ceremony proceeded. Each responded firmly, calmly,
                  solemnly, as if each understood and felt the import of the vows they were taking
                  upon them. When at last Ernest was told to place the ring upon her finger, he drew
                  it from its case, and ere he placed it there, showed her a word which was engraved
                  in it. That word was "Forever."</p>
               <p>"Forever!" she repeated, looking in his eyes with unutterable fondness. A moment
                  more, and the last words were spoken—the twain were one, and Ernest Cramer pressed
                  a fond husband's kiss on a dear wife's spotless brow. A moment was passed in
                  receiving the congratulations of friends, and then the bridal party retired to
                  register their names as witnesses to the union. Again, with a more joyous tone,
                  the organ's swelling notes were heard, like a holy song of thanksgiving and
                  praise; and the congregated audience one by one departed, with feelings too deeply
                  impressed with the scene which they had witnessed ever to forget it.</p>
               <p>The bridal party now returned to their carriages to start for home. First in the
                  cortege stood that of Cramer, before which a pair of noble steeds champed the bit.
                  As he approached with his wife on his arm, the driver most incautiously left the
                  horses' heads to open the carriage door. Ernest had just handed his wife in, she
                  had not even taken her seat, when the horses, finding themselves free, bounded
                  forward. The agony which Ernest Cramer felt for one instant, was too intense for
                  utterance; her piercing shrieks fell on his ear, and with a bound which seemed
                  superhuman he reached the step of the carriage, determined, if death came to
                     <emph>her</emph>, he too would share it. The horses, more terrified by her
                  screams, passed with furious speed up the street. Had it been any other day than a
                  Sunday, when the streets are crowded with vehicles, death and destruction must
                  have been speedy.</p>
               <p>"Be calm, Serena, be calm, my blessed <emph>wife!</emph> I am with you!" cried
                  Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Ernest! to die—<emph>to die now</emph>, were <emph>too hard!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"We will not die, dearest! God will protect us! Be calm! I can reach the box, get
                  the reins and check the horses. Only be calm, and keep your seat—do not try to get
                  out!"</p>
               <p>Saying this, and closing the door, the young husband clambered to the top of the
                  carriage and reached the driver's box. But his difficulties were not yet over. The
                  reins were trailing in the dust, at the heels of the maddened horses. But still
                  cool and undaunted, Cramer slipped down upon the pole of the carriage, and with a
                  bold leap threw himself astride of one of the horses. To check them after this,
                  gradually, but steadily by their bridle-reins, was an easy task, and in a few
                  moments all was safe; the pallor of Serena had given place to the flush of pride
                  that her <emph>husband</emph> had saved her. The rest of the bridal party soon
                  rejoined them; and instead of finding, as they had feared and dreaded, the mangled
                  corpses of the newly-wedded pair, they found them calm and happy, laughing at the
                  peril through which<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6961-00000097"/> they had passed.
                  Serena declared that it was "quite romantic—almost as romantic as an
                  elopement."</p>
               <p>A week later. Ernest Cramer was married, and in mental quiet and fancied security,
                  was enjoying a few days of exquisite happiness, in a village of that State which
                  has had the credit of giving birth to the wonderful invention of wooden nutmegs,
                  oak hams, and tin pedlars—a State which is not to be sneezed at or spoke lightly
                  of, for she has ever sent forth her full quota of good men, and true; in war, like
                  her present brave Governor Seymour, to uphold her credit on the battle-field; in
                  peace, to represent her intelligence in the councils of the nation. In a hotel of
                  this village, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">incognito</foreign>, as they supposed,
                  Ernest and his lovely wife were stopping for a week or so. But, alas! those who
                  are "born to fame" can't avoid it, or its annoyances, as "Harry of the West" said,
                  when he sought and prayed for retirement from the persecutions of those who wished
                  to do him honor. On the second evening after Ernest and his bride had reached the
                  Yankee Tavern, in the beautiful little village of N—, after Ernest and his bride
                  had retired to the sanctity of their own apartment, a traveller arrived at the
                  tavern. He was a man of middle age, apparently of genteel, but slender build;
                  remarkable only for a dark, glittering, snake-like eye, and a profusion of
                  jet-black whiskers, which concealed all the lower part of his face, except his
                  mouth and upper lip. His dress was genteel, of a city cut, and his manner
                  sufficiently important to gain extraordinary attention from the landlord and his
                  "help," a sour-faced, old-maidish-looking female, who evidently kept the books, if
                  she didn't appropriate her husband's unmentionables. He was allotted the second
                  best room; a hot supper, consisting of boiled ham, fried eggs, and Johnny-cake,
                  was prepared, of which he partook heartily, every mouthful being carefully watched
                  and instinctively weighed by the aforementioned landlady, who poured out the
                  pallid liquid which she christened <hi rend="i"/>tea, and sweetened with a very
                  small quantity of sugar, which helped to darken the tea. While a tea, the
                  stranger, who had already given in his name as John Clark, asked in a careless way
                  if the house was pretty well filled up.</p>
               <p>"Middlin'!" said the landlady. "Middlin'. There's Mr. Bilbo the lawyer, and the
                  man that writes poetry and confusions (perhaps she meant effusions) for
                     <emph>the</emph> paper—<emph>our</emph> paper, the 'Weekly Magnifier,' and
                  there's the Doctor—he boards here reg'lar—and the stage drivers, there's two of
                  'em, on and off they board here—and there's the Squire, his wife died last
                  Christmas, he and his darter, Peggy, they board here, but she's got a feller: Zeb
                  Jenkins, who's been sittin' up with her for about six years, an' they're agoing to
                  get married soon. And there's—"</p>
               <p>"Good Lord, madam, you've got quite a crowd!" said Mr. Clark, interrupting the
                  loquacious landlady, "but have you no travelling custom?"</p>
               <p>"Strangers? Oh, yes—there was two of the nicest folks come night afore last that
                  ever you laid your eyes on—a new married couple, I guess, for they're mighty
                  lovin'!"</p>
               <p>"Their names?—are they from the city?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, city folks, I reckon, by their looks, but none o' your stuck-up sort. The
                  man gave my little gal, Jerusha, (a proper nice gal is Jerusha, nine years old,
                  and large of her age,) a bright dollar to buy school-books with, cause she said
                  the varses of the Star-Spangled Banner right out, without missin' a word!"</p>
               <p>"What kind of looking folks?" asked the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Young, both young, the lady proper handsome, and well-behaved. and the man not
                     <emph>bad</emph> looking, nuther."</p>
               <p>"Don't you know their names?"</p>
               <p>"They're writ on husband's decalogue that he keeps in the barroom—tho' we haint
                  got no <emph>sperrits</emph>. We call it the <emph>bar-room</emph> 'cause it's the
                  fashion. We don't keep no sperrits, 'ceptin' for sick folks. <emph>Ef</emph> you
                  are <emph>sick</emph>, or hev the stomach-ache, or feel out o' sorts, why, we
                     <emph>can</emph> give you a <emph>leetle sperrits</emph> as
                     <emph>medicine</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I'm <emph>well</emph>,—but can you not let me see the book whereon
                  these names are recorded? I'm from the city; perhaps I might know them."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sartingly! I'll go and git it right off."</p>
               <p>In a few moments the lady returned with what she called the "decalogue," which
                  proved to be a common school "copy-book," in<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000098"/> which various names were entered, with the dates of
                  their arrival The stranger's eye was fixed on the last which was written.</p>
               <p>"Ah, I thought so!" said he, with a very meaning smile.</p>
               <p>"Eh? <emph>Thought what?</emph> D'ye know 'em?" asked the landlady, looking at the
                  name herself.</p>
               <p>"I know that handwriting," said the stranger; "yes, I know i well; but the
                  name—the <emph>name?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Eh? Is there a mystery?" asked the landlady, setting both elbows on the table,
                  and looking <emph>needleish</emph> at the stranger.</p>
               <p>"I don't <emph>say</emph> there's a <emph>mystery</emph>," said he; "but—but,
                  excuse me, madam, I'll say no more. If you'll give me a light, I'll go to
                  bed."</p>
               <p>"Neow, mister, <emph>dew</emph> tell me what this 'ere is. Yeou know 'em;
                  aint—aint they m-a-r-i-e-d? If they wasn't, it would be <emph>awful</emph>, for
                  our house is the decentest tavern in the county."</p>
               <p>The landlady's tone betokened that her suspicions had been awakened by the
                  mysterious manner of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"They <emph>may</emph> be married," said he; "but if they are, it has been very
                  lately; and besides, if they have, he is a candidate for the State's Prison, for
                  he has another wife now."</p>
               <p>"WHAT!" almost screamed the landlady—"Hev we got a <emph>bigamy</emph> in the
                  house? Oh, my gracious! Let me call husband—let me call husband!"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak so loud, dear madam, I may be mistaken in the name: he has his name
                  down here as <emph>Smith</emph>. It's a common, I may say a <emph>very</emph>
                  common name, and handwritings, like faces, are often <emph>similar</emph>, even if
                  not precisely alike. Can't I see them?"</p>
               <p>"Not without they're called out; they're in their room, and there's a bolt inside;
                  but I could hollow fire, or raise a scream; maybe that would bring 'em
                     <emph>eout!</emph> Shall I?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam, it is no matter, because if there <emph>should</emph> be a
                  mistake—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, there ain't no mistake at all. I thought all the time she was a brazen thing,
                  though she was so handsome, and seemed so prim <emph>Married</emph> folks, eh?
                  Wonder if they've got money enough to pay their bill?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; he's very well off, and spends his money like a lord."</p>
               <p>"Well, <emph>ef</emph> husband don't tuck it onto him, when he makes out the bill,
                  I'll tuck it onto husband after they're gone."</p>
               <p>"How long are they going to stay?"</p>
               <p>"A week, they said; but they shan't stay a day after to-morrow, sure's as my
                  name's Ruth Ringle! A <emph>bigamy</emph> in <emph>my</emph> house!
                     <emph>Ef</emph> they know'd it, all my boarders would leave, 'ceptin' the
                  lawyer, and he aint pertikler!"</p>
               <p>"You had better let them stay, madam, to the end of the week, and
                     <emph>then</emph> let them know that you know them. I don't wish to see them,
                  on a second thought. What time do they get up?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yesterday morning they was up very airly, and out a walkin' over the
                  fields—I s'pose they'll do so agin."</p>
               <p>"Well, please have me called at daylight, I will go on early—I have to be in
                  Meriden on business to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"On business?—it's court day, maybe you're a lawyer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a sort of one, though I don't practice in <emph>this</emph> State."</p>
               <p>"I thought so. Wall, you think I'd better let 'em stay?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but have them watched—I may some day want to <emph>prove</emph> that they
                  were here as man and wife."</p>
               <p>"Wall, you'll have no bother to prove that, for my words is as good as nary
                  'tother woman's in the neighborhood. Jest tew think of him an' that brazen hussy!
                  Wall, wall, this is a strange world, and there are strange creeturs in it."</p>
               <p>"True, madam, and if you please, now, I'll take a light and retire. Don't forget
                  what I have told you. I am confident I am right—and when he has paid his bill,
                  give this fellow and his pretended wife fits! His real name is
                  <emph>Cramer</emph>—tell the woman that he has another wife, and you know it, but
                  don't tell them how you found it out. Be careful about that—I shall often pass by
                  here, and will always stop, Remember!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, laws a massy, you needn't think I'll forget! <emph>He</emph>, to bring a
                     <emph>bigamy</emph> to <emph>my</emph> house! Oh, I've a good notion to turn
                  'em right eout to-night, cold as it is! They're in the best room tew. Clean sheets
                  and the new crockery wash-basin tew. It is <emph>tew</emph> bad!"</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6961-00000099"/>
               <p>"Keep calm, my dear madam; and by the way, as I am to go on early, I'll pay my
                  bill to-night. What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, let's see! There's the hoss, eighteen pence—supper and lodgin' for you—will
                  you take a bite afore you start in the mornin'?"</p>
               <p>"No, I never eat so early."</p>
               <p>"Wall then, the sum total 'll be three and sixpence, an' ef you feel
                     <emph>sick</emph> in the mornin', tansy bitters thrown in, though we never keep

               <p>"Here is a half-dollar, madam. Never mind the change—you are too reasonable."</p>
               <p>The landlady took the half-dollar, examined it very closely to see that it was not
                  bogus, and then deliberately tied it up in a corner of her handkerchief. She then
                  lighted a tallow candle, and handing it to the gentleman, said:</p>
               <p>"You know where your room is, Mister! It's the next one to theirs—<emph>ef</emph>
                  they talk you can hear 'em, for the partition is mighty thin. There
                     <emph>was</emph> cracks in it, but I pasted the Gospel Advocate all over
                  'era—but then that'll not stop listenin', tho' the bible says listeners never
                  hears no good of themselves, and I know its true, for I listened one night when I
                  heard the squire and lawyer Bilbo a talkin'; and what do you think they was a
                  talkin' about?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I cannot imagine, madam."</p>
               <p>"Wall, they was a talkin' about what they'd had for breakfast, and a grumblin' and
                  complainin' of me, at that."</p>
               <p>"Well, good night, madam. Have me called early, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Good night, Mister! I'll wake you up myself. I shan't sleep none with them are
                     <emph>bigamies</emph> in my house. I am glad I haint got no silver spoons."</p>
               <p>The stranger now retired and the landlady busied herself in clearing off the
                  table, muttering her thoughts about the "bigamies,"—"not loud, but deep."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>ONCE more we must enter the "Hall of the Convocation of the Twenty-four Elders,"
                  that room draped in black as if in consonance with the deeds revealed there, and
                  the plans there concocted to strengthen and spread the power of the most infamous
                  and dangerous society that ever existed in the world—a society which honors no
                  principle, feels no mercy, has no bounds to its grasping ambition—which is as
                  mercenary as it is intriguing and base.</p>
               <p>The elders were all there, each man in his chair, and "HIS EMINENCE" was standing
                  on the elevation at the head of the table, prepared to address them. Upon the face
                  of each priest the candle before him cast a wan, sickly light—all looked stern and
                  gloomy. His Eminence glanced from face to face for a moment, and then in his usual
                  bland, serious tone, addressed them:</p>
               <p>"Brothers and Elders," said he,—"since we last met, many things of serious import
                  have occurred—things which required immediate action, and possessed of the
                  authority, we have <emph>acted!</emph> We have added to our Treasury the sum of
                  one hundred thousand dollars; we have secured a new convert in our editor, whose
                  pen is of great political weight; we have taken three young ladies into the
                  Convent of St. Ursula, whose families have immense influence in the land. These
                  are the bright objects upon which our minds with due thankfulness may dwell. But
                  all has not gone pleasantly with us—we have met with obstacles and reverses. The
                  arch enemy, the heretic of whom I spake at our last convocation, still opposes our
                  progress. He has rescued a daughter whom the Church had marked for her own, and we
                  may thereby lose her fortune, upon which our eye had been placed, as a heritage
                  for the Lord. He has aroused thousands, and excited them against us. He seems to
                  anticipate all our aims—to have a knowledge of all our movements. He must speedily
                     be<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6961-00000100"/> crushed, and our study must be
                  how to do this so as to undo all that he has done against us. To this effect I am
                  now drawing a net around him—my spies are watching his every movement. His free,
                  bold pen has made him envied and hated by the Press—we will, ere long, bring a
                  combination to bear which will crush him and his friends. The next thing for our
                  consideration is to put a stop to the idea of general and liberal education, which
                  is gaining ground so rapidly among the people. It must be stopped before it is too
                  late. Urge upon your people, and use your power in the confessional, to crush it.
                  Bid all voting men to vote against it, to use their influence with others. If free
                  education succeeds we will perish—for we <emph>know,</emph> and amongst ourselves
                  can say it—the ignorant are the most obedient and the most devoted of our
                  followers.</p>
               <p>"Brothers—I have met you, more to allude to this last subject, this morning, than
                  for any other purpose. I beseech you at once to <emph>act</emph> upon my
                  suggestions.</p>
               <p>Each priest silently bowed his head in reply to the "order" of "his EMINENCE." The
                  latter continued:</p>
               <p>"Brothers—we have a great work before us, and but little time to do it in. Each
                  arrival from the old country brings us information of serious import. We see
                  kingdoms crumbling—thrones falling to earth The time is fast approaching, when the
                  seat of the church must be removed hither. When the Papal throne must be erected
                  in this vast Western Empire. That this <emph>can</emph> be done without
                     <emph>effort</emph>, no one can suppose. But that it <emph>can</emph> be done,
                  no good Catholic, no true follower of Saint Ignatius, will doubt. We must labor to
                  this end, and <emph>for</emph> this end, <emph>all</emph> things are justifiable.
                  For this end I have associated with and formed plans in connection with thieves
                  and murderers—with criminals of the darkest grade, for well you know our adage,
                  the end justifieth the deed. It is our wish that each of ye take active measures,
                  in your district, against the American societies. Stir up dissensions between your
                  flocks and them—the quiet policy is no longer needed—we are strong enough now to
                  show a bold front.</p>
               <p>Now, brothers, ye will leave the offerings for the Treasury, and we will separate
                  to meet again at the usual hour."</p>

               <p>ON the day after the marriage of Earnest Cramer to Serena Clifford, his Eminence
                  was interrupted in a letter which he was writing by the entrance of his fair
                  amanuensis, Allie, with a morning paper which she held in her hand, and toward a
                  portion of which she pointed. The priest smiled as his eye rested on the paragraph
                  which she indicated.</p>
               <p>"I knew of this, before!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Then the plans of your Eminence are frustrated."</p>
               <p>"Not a all," he replied—"it only makes the matter more romantic."</p>
               <p>"Surely, it is useless for me now to pursue the matter!"</p>
               <p>"No, child, far from it. You will pursue it with even more ardor. You will win his
                  love, and then—"</p>
               <p>"But, Eminence, his <emph>wife!</emph> his wife?"</p>
               <p>"Will be so no longer than <emph>you</emph> please! A <emph>divorce</emph> can be
                  easily gained in this land, where <emph>law</emph> and <emph>justice</emph> stand
                  ready for the use of the highest bidder."</p>
               <p>"But, my lord, if she loves him, that would break her heart."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Heart?</emph> Child—child, judge not that all others have hearts because
                     <emph>you</emph> have one. Her heart is not of a kind which will break
                  easily."</p>
               <p>"Does she not love him, or he her?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Love</emph>, girl? Why, they've been acquainted but a few weeks! Do you

               <p>"Yes, Eminence. My heart tells me that love knows no <emph>time</emph> that it is
                  the subject of no <emph>will</emph>—that it is as eccentric and as independent of
                  all human power, or planetary rule, as the blazing meteor which darts athwart the

                  erring can be won back. Do now as I bid thee. Write him a letter, full of deep,
                  devoted, hopeless love. Tell him that one, to him unknown, is watching his every
                  footstep <emph>fondly</emph>, guarding him in danger, waking when he sleeps
                  worshipping in silence and in tears. Write, as thou in thy dreamy hours can write
                  so well. If you but wake in his bosom a single desire to know <emph>who</emph>
                  thou art, or kindle one spark of <emph>pity</emph>, the rest will be easy."</p>
               <p>The young girl looked sad and perplexed. She shook her head gently, and murmured:
                  "If <emph>she</emph> should <emph>love</emph> him, it would break her heart!"</p>
               <p>"What are human hearts or human <emph>lives</emph>, where the glory of the Church
                  is concerned!" said his Eminence, in a tone of unusual severity.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Eminence, pardon me, I meant not to offend!"</p>
               <p>"You did not, sweet child; but you know how it frets me when I plan for the good
                  of the Church and the glory of God, to have my views questioned. In the Church,
                  we, who are its heads, ask nought but <emph>obedience</emph>—implicit
                     <emph>faith</emph> and obedience. God has given us the heretics for a spoil,
                  and their land for a heritage. All things are right which are done against them.
                  But this young man has that in him, which, turned into the right channel, would
                  make him useful and great. I repeat, Allie, that <emph>you</emph> must win and
                  wear him."</p>
               <p>"Where is he now?"</p>
               <p>"Absent for a few days on a bridal tour. A faithful <emph>friend</emph> of ours
                  has followed him—will watch his every footstep. Already the seed of suspicion has,
                  through him, been sowed in the heart of the young bride—already has he seen a
                  foreshadowing of the persecutions he must endure, if I err not, for I have sent
                  the messenger forth. But he will return—the letter I bade you write must be the
                  first to meet his eye."</p>
               <p>"Father, I will obey."</p>

               <p>"How strange they act in this house, Ernest! Last night that landlady turned her
                  snub nose up, as she waited upon us at the tea-table, and was as short as her own
                  pie-crust in her answers to me."</p>
               <p>Thus spake Serena Cramer, as she was robing herself, after her third night of
                  married life in the country.</p>
               <p>"They <emph>certainly</emph> act very differently from the manner in which they
                  conducted themselves when we arrived," said Cramer. "They must have discovered our
                     <abbr>incog.</abbr>, and not knowing our reasons for wishing to pass a quiet
                  week of happiness, regard us with suspicion. After breakfast I'll try and find
                  out."</p>
               <p>"Breakfast! breakfast!" was heard in a shrill shriek from below. "Please to come
                  to breakfast!" was heard again a moment later, at the door, the voice being
                  accompanied by a distant sound which resembled the ringing of a cracked
                  cow-bell.</p>
               <p>Cramer and his wife were soon ready, and shortly after descended, arm in arm, to
                  the breakfast room. Mrs. Ringle already was seated at the head of the table, with
                  a huge tin coffee-pot before her, and a few very small "crockery" tea-cups at
                  hand. Her face looked as sour and pale as buttermilk, while she poured out and
                  economically creamed and sugared the coffee to suit her own taste, and her
                  husband, who sat on her right, looked pale and scared, as if he feared that a
                  storm was brewing. The other boarders were scattered along the table, each
                  apparently more intent upon getting a fair share of the <emph>few</emph> slices of
                  ham and eggs which were around, than upon watching the looks or movements of the
                  others.</p>
               <p>"Hope your coffee's sweet enough <emph>this</emph> mornin', marm!" said the
                     <unclear>landlady</unclear>, with a toss of her head, as she handed the cup to
                  Serena.</p>
               <p>"It is doubtless sweetened in proportion to its strength!" said the<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000102"/> lady, in a tone and with a smile which Ernest
                  understood, and which even the landlady could not entirely misunderstand.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>s'pose</emph> we plain country folks don't make our drinkin' stuff so
                  all-fired strong as you city folks do; but it's good enough for us, and we're as
                  good as anybody, and a little better than <emph>some</emph> folks!"</p>
               <p>A very lofty toss of the head accompanied this last remark of the landlady's; and
                  while her sharp nose assumed a shining appearance at its tip, it also appeared to
                  have taken another link in, in the angle, and to have <emph>pugged</emph> a degree
                  more than before.</p>
               <p>"Don't you think so, husban'?" said she, hearing no reply from any other
                  source.</p>
               <p>"Think what, my dear?" meekly responded the landlord.</p>
               <p>"That we're full as good, if we ain't a leetle better, than some city folks!"
                  responded Mrs. Ringle. "We country folks don't make <emph>bigamies</emph> of
                  ourselves!"</p>
               <p>Here Mrs. R. darted a look of scorn at both Mr. and Mrs. Cramer, which neither of
                  them felt very much, neither comprehending its meaning or its cause.</p>
               <p>"What d'ye mean by bigamy, Mrs. Ringle?" asked the lawyer—a long, lean,
                  cadaverous-looking individual, with a very stiff, ear-endangering shirt-collar
                  rigged out ahead of either cheek, who smelt a case, buzzard-like, ahead.</p>
               <p>"Isn't it <emph>bigamy</emph> for a man to marry a young woman, if he's got
                  another wife living?" asked Mrs. R., fixing her eyes on Cramer, who was just then
                  engaged in severing the wing-joint of a very tough fowl.</p>
               <p>"It would be bigamy, if he married a woman, young <emph>or</emph> old, provided he
                  had a livin' wife at the time of the contract. Ahem!" said the lawyer in a tone of
                  oracular dignity. Do you know of such a case, Mrs. Ringle?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do; and I know that some folks don't go by the name their father and
                  mother give 'em, when they travel!" said the landlady, in a louder key, still
                  looking at Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Wife, wife, be keerful!" said the husband in a deprecating tone.</p>
               <p>"Don't you <emph>wife</emph> ME, Mr. Ringle; I know what I'm about, an' what I
                  say. I'm a decent woman, I am, and ain't no bigamy, nuther!"</p>
               <p>Here poor Serena was favored with a look which would have soured a pan of new
                  milk.</p>
               <p>The direction of the landlady's looks, and the pointedness of her remarks, had now
                  become noticed by all at the table except Cramer and his wife, who, in their
                  innocent and utter carelessness of all around them, and beyond the little world of
                  their own love, saw nothing, cared for nothing. But Ernest, happening to raise his
                  eyes, noticed that every look was turned toward him, and the expression of each
                  face was so singular that he was tempted to enquire what was the matter.</p>
               <p>"Matter enough, I reckon, if yeou don't git out of this State purty soon!" said
                  the landlady. "Bigamies goes to State Prison here!"</p>
               <p>"Bigamies, good woman! What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Don't <emph>good woman</emph> me, feller! Though I guess I be as good a woman as
                  that hussy o' yourn; I'm an only wife, at any rate!</p>
               <p>"What do you mean—these insults seem to be premeditated?"</p>
               <p>"You needn't make up no dictionary words to me, Mr. CRAMER. Ah! I thought that
                  would touch you. Now, I guess, you'd better pay your bill and travel; you see I
                     <emph>know</emph> you!"</p>
               <p>"Ernest, what does this woman mean?" said Serena, shrinking back in terror from
                  the gaze of the men, whose eyes were all fixed on her.</p>
               <p>"God only knows! she has discovered my name, but that's nothing. There is some
                  mystery in this; I'll unravel it. You say my name is Cramer, madam," he continued,
                  addressing the landlady. Will you have the kindness to tell me how you found that
                  out?"</p>
               <p>"I don't tell how I find out things; it's enough that I knows 'em. You don't deny
                  that your name is Cramer?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Then what did you put it down <emph>Smith</emph> for, on our decalogue?"</p>
               <p>"A clear case of false pretence," muttered the lawyer, <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                     >sotto voce</foreign>.</p>
               <p>"To protect myself and wife from impertinent curiosity," said Cramer, reddening
                  with anger; "and if I find it necessary, will take means of a stronger nature to
                  protect us both from insult."</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6961-00000103"/>
               <p>Oh, you <emph>awful</emph> creetur! Ef the Squire don't take you up, he's good for
                  nothing."</p>
               <p>"A threat of violence is sufficient to bind over in two good sureties," muttered
                  the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Serena, come, go up to the room with me," said Ernest to his alarmed wife. "I
                  will leave you, and return and settle with these contemptible wretches."</p>
               <p>Too terrified to speak, trembling and blushing, the young wife took his arm and
                  left the room.</p>
               <p>Then a council of war was held in the room below, to the utter neglect of weak
                  coffee and the other "fixins." The landlady insisted upon the Squire's arresting
                  Cramer for bigamy. But the latter was a man of some little caution, as also of
                  sufficient legal knowledge to know that mere <emph>suspicion</emph> would not
                  justify a warrant, especially on so serious a charge. He asked the lawyer how he
                  should proceed.</p>
               <p>"We must have some <emph>proof,</emph>" he said. "Here we have a report
                  second-handed, through Mrs. Ringle, from a person whom nobody knows, and who has
                  gone off, the Lord only knows where. Without somebody'll swear that he is a
                  bigamist, I can't take any steps toward his arrest."</p>
               <p>"I'll swear it—yes, I'll swear it on a whole stack of bibles, so I will," cried
                  Mrs. Ringle.</p>
               <p>"Then if it <emph>shouldn't</emph> turn out to be true, you'd be liable for
                     <emph>perjury</emph>," suggested the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"I don't care," she cried; "I'd rayther be a perjury than a bigamy. Ef the Squire
                  don't take up that <emph>wicked</emph> man, I'll never speak to him as long as he
                  lives. Just as if one wife wasn't enough for <emph>any</emph> man."</p>
               <p>"One would be, if he possessed your amiable qualities, madam." said the object of
                  her wrath, entering the room.</p>
               <p>"I don't want none of yer insinerrations against me, mister. I only want your
                  money for what you've eat and slept in <emph>my</emph> house."</p>
               <p>"State the amount of your bill, madam, and it will give me extreme pleasure to
                  settle it," said Cramer, with a calm and pleasant smile on his face.</p>
               <p>"It's eleven dollars, <emph>ef</emph> you've got that much," replied the
                     <emph>tartaric</emph> specimen of humanity.</p>
               <p>Cramer drew a heavy purse from his pocket, and rolling out a handful of gold,
                  selected two eagles and laid them upon the table. The grey eyes of the landlady
                  looked at the golden treasure, as if it was a magnet for the vision.</p>
               <p>"Husband—got change for this 'ere big gold piece?" she asked, in a much lower
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"No, haint got so much change in the house I'm afeard—I'll go up-stairs to the
                  bureau and see," replied the husband.</p>
               <p>"Stop, sir, a moment before you go—I've something to say to <emph>all</emph> who
                  are present. To annoy me, or insult me, seems to have been an intention on the
                  part of some or <emph>all</emph> of you. This woman, not content with a common
                  method of insulting, charges me with bigamy, to the terror and annoyance of my
                  young bride. I came to this quiet village for a few days of relaxation, from the
                  cares and business of a city life. I came <abbr>incog</abbr>, not wishing to make
                  any acquaintance or receive any more attention than the common civilities due to a
                  stranger. But the insinuations of that woman make it necessary that you should
                  know who and what I am. My name is ERNEST CRAMER, my profession that of an AUTHOR;
                  my address, No. 6 B—street, in the city of New York."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ernest Cramer!" muttered the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ernest Cramer—dear me, I've read his books!" murmured the Squire's
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>The landlady looked first at her husband, then at the rest of the company, then
                  down at the gold which lay before her—her countenance indicating confusion and
                  perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Now," continued Cramer, "I should like to know <emph>why</emph> I have been
                  insulted. Who among you here, have got up this infamous piece of business."</p>
               <p>"I assure you upon the honor of a gentleman and a member of the bar, Mr. Cramer,
                  that none of us have had any part in this, nor intended to insult you, or wound
                  your feelings!" said the lawyer.<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6961-00000104"/> "Some
                  traveller, passing this morning, and seeing your name in the bar-book, told Mrs.
                  Ringle that you were married to another wife."</p>
               <p>"<emph>My name</emph> was not entered upon the book."</p>
               <p>"He said he know'd your hand-writin', sir!" said the landlady, her voice becoming
                  mild and beseeching. "He told me <emph>such</emph> a story, sir, he set me up
                  dreadful 'gainst you, but I hope you'll forgive me, sir—he was a nice looking
                  man—a grand looking man—had whiskers, big black whiskers."</p>
               <p>"He was some villain who wished to <emph>annoy</emph> me, by his infamous hoax!"
                  said Cramer, bitterly, "and he has succeeded, so far as <emph>annoyance</emph> is
                  concerned. Now I will take my change, if you please</p>
               <p>I believe the stage passes in half an hour. I wish to arrange for my
                  departure."</p>
               <p>"Now, Mister Cramer, don't go to-day. Don't go off in a huff cause a rascal made
                  me believe you was a bigamy, and made me carry on so!" said the landlady, looking
                  as sweet as a fresh pumpkin pie. "Your wife is the properest, nicest behaved lady
                  ever I did see, and I'll go right up and ask her pardon, so I will."</p>
               <p>"You can save yourself the trouble, madam," said Cramer, "she is changing her
                  apparel for travel. I will bear your excuses to her The change, if you
                  please."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mister Cramer, you make me feel so mean. That one ten dollar piece there, is
                  enough, goodness knows, for you've been no trouble at all. Oh my gracious, the
                  next time a man comes and sets me against good boarders, I guess I'll know
                  it."</p>
               <p>To understand the reason of all this scene, we must witness another, and to
                  describe it, I'll open a new chapter.</p>

               <p>ALLIE had left "His Eminence" but a moment, when the favorite servant of the
                  latter entered, and reported the name of "<hi rend="i"/>Judas Iscariot Arnold,"
                  stating him to be in waiting for an audience.</p>
               <p>"Admit him—<emph>always</emph> admit <emph>him</emph> without ceremony!" said the
                  priest.</p>
               <p>A moment passed and Arnold appeared; not the same close shaven, pale,
                  sleek-looking man whom we have seen, but a dashing, bewhiskered individual, whom
                  at the first glance you would take for a fop of the first water. Were it not for
                  that small, dark, keen, snake-like eye and his thin lips, even "His Eminence"
                  would have doubted that Arnold stood before him, but those were marks which could
                  not be mistaken, in spite of his false whiskers and disguise, and extending his
                  hand, he said:</p>
               <p>"You are truly welcome, friend; hast news of the common enemy?"</p>
               <p>Arnold, with one of his sinister, meaning smiles, took a chair and seated himself
                  before he replied. Then, when a frown of impatience began to cloud the high brow
                  of "His Eminence," the man, with a low chuckle, said:</p>
               <p>"I've had rare fun—rare fun!"—</p>
               <p>"Well—explain! Let me enjoy, by hearing it."</p>
               <p>"Your Reverence shall! Oh! it was rich—ha! ha! ho! ho! You see, when he got
                  married, he started upon his 'bridal tour.' I meant to have dogged him every step
                  of the way, but by an accident I was detained, and he got the start of me by a
                  trip in the boat. But I followed the next day, and found him rusticating at a nice
                  little country tavern, where a regular Yankee landlady presided. Her I impressed
                  with a <emph>terrible</emph> idea that he was <emph>not</emph> married to Miss
                  Clifford, but had another wife living, and though I did not wait to see<pb
                     n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6961-00000105"/> the <emph>scene</emph> that followed, I
                  know one <emph>did</emph> follow, for this morning I saw him, pale and evidently
                  annoyed, returning with his bride to the city. Ere now she has a letter, too,
                  which coming apparently from an injured woman, will add to her disquietude, to say
                  the least. The seeds of suspicion once sown in a woman's breast can never be
                  entirely eradicated, and when but a spark of the fire of jealousy once catches
                  there, it will burn, even half smothered though it be—it will burn until it bursts
                  forth in a flame which human power, and truth, the very <emph>ears</emph> of
                  truthful <emph>innocence</emph>, cannot quench."</p>
               <p>"You have done well, nobly well," said the priest, with a smile. "You possess
                  qualities which would fit you admirably for a servant of our Order."</p>
               <p>"What are they; may it please your Reverence to explain?"</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, and I will. You are bold and unscrupulous; wise as a Solon, cunning as
                  a Mercury, and that which you undertake you <emph>complete!</emph> Had you lived
                  in the days of Loyola, or even were you now near the person of his Holiness at
                  Rome, you would stand a fair chance for wearing a Cardinal's hat of scarlet."</p>
               <p>The man smiled as only <emph>he</emph> could smile; a smile so dark and sinister
                  that even His Eminence shuddered.</p>
               <p>"I seek not that honor!" he said; "I seek a power which boundless
                     <emph>wealth</emph> alone can bring me. I seek a power which can rule the
                  courts of Justice—which can bring Innocence weeping and helpless to my feet; a
                  power which can subdue virtue, which can crush my enemies and make my
                     <emph>friends</emph> subservient to my will. I wish a power which can
                     <emph>damn</emph> America, which holds my name in perpetual disgrace"</p>
               <p>Wealth shall be yours, if you but succeed in crushing Cramer, and with his fall,
                  succeed in so damning the <emph>principles</emph> which he advocates, as to stop
                  the advances of the Order to which he belongs. Yes, wealth so boundless that an
                  ASTOR would bow humbly to you."</p>
               <p>"I shall succeed," said Arnold, quietly; "I shall succeed! I shall visit my
                     <emph>friend</emph> Cramer to-day, and relate to him particulars of an
                  aggravated wrong, which will, I hope, induce him to load himself with a
                     <emph>libel suit</emph> with an editor whose wealth and want of principle, and
                  whose influence all combined, will make him a dangerous enemy."</p>
               <p>"But how will you do this without showing your hand at too early a stage in the
                  game?"</p>
               <p>"I have <emph>that</emph> all arranged. There are men connected with the
                     <emph>bar</emph> in this city, as your Reverence doubtless is aware, who are
                  ready for anything. Men who are <emph>thieves</emph> by nature, and who being
                  allowed and countenanced in crime, have gained a confident audacity which almost
                  surpasses belief. One of these I know, a plausible, well-connected scoundrel, whom
                  I have moulded to my aims, and whom I shall use in this matter. He associates with
                  our 'first families,' and can give 'references' which would satisfy a far more
                  suspicious mind than that of the too-confiding Cramer; and I feel sure that I can
                  succeed through him in bringing on a crisis which will bring our enemy
                     <emph>legally</emph> into trouble, and also sink him in public estimation.
                  While working this plan, I shall also be busy in wrecking his domestic happiness,
                  and in endeavoring to bring upon him the shame and disgrace of a public separation
                  from his young and lovely wife, and in this last matter I look for the aid which
                  your Reverence has promised."</p>
               <p>"Admirable friend! You shall not be disappointed. We cannot fail," said the
                  priest, forgetting his usual dignity, and warmly grasping the hand of the vile
                  miscreant who sat before him.</p>
               <p>The servant entered at this moment and handed his Eminence a card.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the latter, as he glanced at it. "Our trusty servant MacVampyre. Tell
                  him to come up!"</p>
               <p>When the servant turned to obey the order, the priest remarked to Arnold—</p>
               <p>"You doubtless know MacVampyre?"</p>
               <p>"I do by reputation, but have never met him," replied Arnold.</p>
               <p>"He is a useful dog," said the priest. "He does not possess much talent, but he is
                  an excellent liar, a very <emph>plausible</emph> liar, and has <emph>no
                     scruples.</emph> He is always ready, very obedient and docile, and uses his
                  Gazette to great purpose in our cause. True, he is <emph>mercenary</emph> to a
                  fault, but we can afford to pay servants who work as he does."</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6961-00000106"/>
               <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of a tall, slim, cadaverous,
                  thin-lipped individual, whose body seemed to be made for cringing, it was so
                  pliable. He bowed low on entering, bowed as he stepped forward, and when his
                  Eminence extended his hand, bowed again and kissed it.</p>
               <p>"We are glad to see you, Mac!" said his Eminence. "Let me introduce to you a
                  friend of our cause, Mr. Arnold—Mr. MacVampyre, editor of the 'PROPAGANDIST OF
                  JESUITISM,' a journal of great influence, circulated among the faithful,
                  gratuitously in many cases."</p>
               <p>"I am the gentleman's most obadient humble servant," said the new comer, with a
                  strong <emph>Sligo</emph> accent, bowing three or four times quickly in
                  succession, and nearly touching the floor at each inclination.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Arnold is a fine writer, and may wish to use the columns of the
                  'Propagandist,' for the purposes of which I am cognisant, and for the benefit of
                  Holy Mother Church," said the priest.</p>
               <p>"Your Eminence commands me. Anything which he writes shall find convanient
                  insertion," said the Editor. "Sure, its an honor as well as a pleasure to serve
                  yer Eminence."</p>
               <p>"You are ever dutiful. I shall not fail to commend you to particular notice in my
                  next epistle to our Lord at Rome. Did you write as I bade you in regard to the
                  school system?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yer Eminence. I've come out with a <emph>new</emph> idea—one that'll take
                  with the <emph>paple</emph>, I'm thinkin'. Yer Eminence knows what a horror almost
                  all of 'em have for the name of 'infidel'—and I have termed the free school system
                  as it now exists, an 'infidel' system."</p>
               <p>"But," said Arnold, "the people at large will <emph>know</emph> better."</p>
               <p>"D—n the paple at large—(beggin' yer Eminence's pardon for saying the same)—but
                  before they find fairly out what the cause of the charge is, we'll have the law
                     <emph>defated</emph>, and sure that's all we want If it is once crushed, we'll
                  never permit it to be revived. My <unclear>war</unclear> cries against it are all
                  taking. To the rich man I cry, 'taxation;' <unclear>to</unclear> the poor man, if
                  he has a vote, I cry, 'infidelity wishes to <unclear/> yer children,' and so with
                  the <emph>two</emph> I know we can work to a <emph>good</emph> effect."</p>
               <p>"True," said Arnold, "and being well acquainted with some points which can be
                  reached and easily touched in <emph>American</emph> character, I will prepare a
                  series of articles which will aid you."</p>
               <p>"I'll be under tin thousan' obligations to ye, sir."</p>
               <p>"Have you the 'proof' of the article I wrote in regard to the Sisters?" asked the
                  priest.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yer Eminence, I've brought it."</p>
               <p>"Then, gentlemen, let me beg you to enter the next room for a few moments—you will
                  find refreshments there. Dennis will attend you. I wish to revise the
                  article."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; but if yer Eminence plase, let me ask ef you've seen the Court report
                  of the '<hi rend="i"/>Daily Barber,'<ref rend="super" target="#note_002"
                     xml:id="return_002">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>"No—what is there special in it?"</p>
               <p>"A new, and I fear a rather too broadly spoken, but very natural idea of yer
                  Eminence's friend, Judge Weekly. He issued this principle in a charge to a jury
                  yesterday—that brothels are 'necessary evils' in a great city like this."</p>
               <p>The priest bit his lips with vexation.</p>
               <p>"It is too soon!" he muttered. "The man is foolish—the sentiment is right, but the
                  people are not prepared. I'll <choice>
                     <sic>repremand</sic>

                  </choice> him. Yet he is a useful servant—it will not do to hurt his feelings.
                  Mac, you must support him in the idea—a little special argument must be used to
                  defend him if the 'Press' should attack him for it."</p>
               <p>"Had not your Eminence better use a <emph>golden</emph> argument to keep them from
                  writing at all on the matter and thus save the necessity of replying to any
                  attacks, and prevent the people at large from hearing of an idea which they will
                  pronounce monstrous, and which will arouse their indignation!" said Arnold.</p>
               <p>"True—see to it, Mac—see to it. But there is one pen which cannot be bought, and
                  nothing escapes the eye of that Cramer.—Henceforth, mark me, one of his by-words
                  of reproach against us will be that one of our servants and adherents, has on the
                  Bench declared that houses of prostitution are 'necessary evils' in a city."</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6961-00000107"/>
               <p>"Yes, be jabers!" said the editor; "I can fancy I hear him now in his harangue to
                  the cursed <emph>heretics</emph>, sneering out the name of our friend, and calling
                  him '<emph>Necessary Evil Wakely!</emph>' Sure an' it was a great oversight in him
                  to make such a charge."</p>
               <p>"I've no doubt that he was sincere and honest in his opinion, and spoke from a
                     <emph>personal</emph> conviction that such things <emph>are</emph> necessary,"
                  said Arnold, with a slightly sneering accent.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me now, gentlemen, I wish to revise these articles," said his Eminence.
                  "You will find wine in the next room. I will join you in a glass, after I have
                  finished."</p>
               <p>The two men retired as requested. MacVampyre first laying a roll of proof-sheets,
                  fresh and damp from the press, before his Eminence.</p>
               <p>After they had gone, the latter touched the silver bell which lay on his table.
                  The door from the inner room opened, and Allie, his fair young amanuensis,
                  entered.</p>
               <p>"Child," said he, in his mild, winning tone, "here is the 'proof' of your article
                  upon the Beauties of the Convent System—revise it carefully; it is a beautifully
                  written and <emph>plausible</emph> article, and will doubtless have its effect on
                  many a fair daughter of Eve, who either dreads the world and its dangers, or is
                  tired of it and its follies."</p>
               <p>Sighing sadly, as if the task was painful, Allie seated herself at the table, and
                  commenced revising the "proof" which he laid before her While she was doing this,
                  the priest gazed at her intellectual, lovely face—at her slight but graceful
                  figure; and while a look of disgusting sensuality gathered on his face, and a
                  flush of passion rose to his very brow, he murmured, too low for her to hear
                  it—</p>
               <p>"Pity she is my own daughter!"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that "His Eminence," the "Governor General" of the Jesuit clan, is
                  a bit better man than that "<emph>infallible</emph> Pope," Alexander, whose own
                     <emph>daughter</emph> was his mistress? There is yet a <emph>hope</emph>, if
                  "his Eminence" can refrain from following the example of the "illustrious" Pope,
                  the "<emph>Holy</emph> Father" who holds the "<emph>primacy</emph>" over all the
                  world, temporal and ecclesiastical, according to the belief of his infatuated

               <p>ERNEST CRAMER was seated in his study, and close by his side was his young and
                  lovely bride. Writing materials were before him, and a half-finished page of
                  manuscript showed that he had been engaged in his old and chosen occupation. But
                  the ink was dried on the paper, and the pen which he had carelessly dropped on the
                  blank portion of the sheet, left no blot. The charms of his fair bride were
                  evidently stronger than those which bound him to his "toil," if to write the free
                  thoughts of a warm, impulsive, fearless heart, can be called
                  <emph>toil</emph>.</p>
               <p>"My beautiful, my own," he murmured, as he held that small, jeweled hand in his
                  own—"mine, <emph>mine forever!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ernest, thine, and thine <emph>forever!</emph>" she responded.</p>
               <p>Then, bending forward, he pressed a fervent kiss upon her fair brow.</p>
               <p>"My lips! my lips, Ernest!" she murmured. "To kiss my forehead seems so cold. Oh,
                  kiss my warm, burning lips—thus—<emph>thus!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Oh, how warm, how sweet, how full of that passion which <emph>wedded</emph> love
                  sanctions, and makes holy, were her kisses! And how lovely, with the rosy blushes
                  chasing each other across her cheeks, as sunlight plays upon a bed of lilies—and
                  her dark blue eyes flashing with love-light, did she look! No wonder that after
                  returning her salute, Ernest Cramer held her in his arms—at arm's length, and
                  gazing at her in her queenly beauty, cried—"My God, is this <emph>real!</emph>
                     Serena—<emph>angel</emph>, is this a <emph>dream</emph>, or is it real! Oh, are
                  you mine—mine own!"</p>
               <p>"Thine, Ernest, <emph>thine</emph> FOREVER!" she replied.</p>
               <p>A low tap at the door was heard. The young wife drew her chair back from the close
                  proximity to her husband—bashful yet, though a week had passed since their union.
                  The person who responded to Ernest's call to "come in," was our old friend, Lizzie
                  Laurel. But<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6961-00000108"/>
                  <emph>how</emph> altered! She was pale, pale as a corpse, and yet that deathly
                  pallor became her more than the ruddy hue of health, it so <emph>contrasted</emph>
                  with her great black eyes, her jet black hair. Her form seemed not to have shrunk
                  from its partridge-like plumpness—it was, like the form of a maiden of "sweet
                  seventeen," whom the writer wots of, as fully and voluptuously developed, as if
                  twenty and five years had ripened its charms. Her air was meek, almost tearful her
                  look, as with a quick glance at Serena, she turned and looked at Cramer,
                  saying:</p>
               <p>"Here are two letters, Mr. Cramer, which were just left at the door!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Lizzie, thank you!" said Cramer, in a pleasant tone</p>
               <p>She made no reply, but turned with a sigh which was audible to both Cramer and his
                  wife, and left the room. <emph>One</emph> of them understood that sigh and its
                  cause.</p>
               <p>"Singular!" said Cramer, smiling; "here is a letter for <emph>you</emph>, and one
                  for <emph>me</emph>, Serena."</p>
               <p>"Why is it singular, dear Ernest?" said the young wife. "Do you think I have no
                  friends?"</p>
               <p>"By no means, dearest, but your letter is in a bold man's hand-writing—mine is the
                  delicate characters of a female."</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> strange, for I have no gentlemen correspondents!" said
                  she.</p>
               <p>"Serena," said Cramer, with a sudden impulse, "let us burn these letter unread! I
                  know not <emph>why</emph>, but I have an innate suspicion that these letters
                  unread are written to harm us—perhaps to try to alter our love."</p>
               <p>"Ernest, to alter <emph>me</emph> is impossible. I'll soon show you."</p>
               <p>Before he could say more, she had broken the seal of the letter directed to
                  her.</p>
               <p>Ernest smiled and opened his. He had scarcely commenced reading his, when a
                  hurried exclamation from her lips, caused him to look up. She was as pale as a
                  corpse—seemed to be gasping for breath.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Serena!</emph> WIFE—oh what is the matter?" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Ernest," she murmured, while her whole form quivered with agitation—"if it was
                     <emph>true</emph>, I would die!"</p>
               <p>"If <emph>what</emph> was true, love? Is it as I feared—is that letter but another
                  ther link in the plot with which they would ruin <emph>me</emph>—ruin
                     <emph>us</emph>, for if one falls, <emph>both</emph> must!" groaned Cramer.</p>
               <p>His wife made no reply, but handed him the letter.</p>
               <p>He glanced at it and smiled.</p>
               <p>"Ernest!" said his wife, "can you smile at <emph>that?</emph> There is a charge—a
                  terrible charge there; and the <emph>name</emph> of the young lady is given—her
                  name and address!"</p>
               <p>"So much the better, love, for it will be easier to prove the falsehood of this
                  charge."</p>
               <p>"Then you <emph>do</emph> know such a lady as is there mentioned?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dearest, she is one of the most respectable ladies in the city the writer
                  mentions, and I have a slight acquaintance with her—have seen and met her in
                  company a half-dozen times, perhaps. I wish you to write to her."</p>
               <p>"I cannot, Ernest—I cannot!"</p>
               <p>"Then I shall, Serena. This infamous charge has been trumped up by some enemy, to
                  produce a quarrel between you and me! My God, why cannot they let my domestic
                  affairs—my <emph>home</emph> alone? My public character may be handled as they
                  please, but my heart, my <emph>home</emph> should be sacred."</p>
               <p>"They shall not invade it to your injury, dearest," said the young wife fondly. "I
                  will not believe or care for any anonymous charge."</p>
               <p>"Yet, dearest, as I <emph>know</emph> the lady mentioned here, it is a duty that I
                  owe to you, to myself and to her, to clear up this affair. I shall write a letter
                  now, before you, asking her positively whether I ever made <emph>any</emph>
                  advances to her, of <emph>any</emph> kind, not even to think of the connexion
                  spoken of in this letter. Whatever her answer is, you shall open and read it
                  before I do."</p>
               <p>"Ernest, I require no such proof. Your word is all sufficient—but if it
                     <emph>was</emph> true, it would break my heart!"</p>
               <p>"That "<emph>if!</emph>" Could it be that suspicion had entered that young and
                  loving heart? Yes, or that "<emph>if</emph>" never had passed her lips.</p>
               <p>"Ernest, without hesitation, wrote a letter to the young lady brought in question
                  by the letter, asking in plain and unequivocal terms whether she had ever received
                     <emph>any attentions</emph> of an amatory<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000109"/> character from him, or whether in word or deed he
                  had ever exceeded the bounds of propriety as a common and respectful acquaintance.
                  This letter he sealed before his wife, called a servant, and sent it to the
                  post-office.</p>
               <p>After this was gone, he took up his pen again, as if about to resume his
                  manuscript, when Serena interrupted him.</p>
               <p>"Why do you not read <emph>your</emph> letter?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Because I think it is something written for the same purpose that the other was.
                  It is written by a female, and I have no female correspondent."</p>
               <p>"Read the letter to me, dear Ernest."</p>
               <p>"What is the use, dearest? I don't care to know its contents."</p>
               <p>"But my curiosity is excited—read it to me, Ernest, <emph>do</emph> please read
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"Your wish is my command, my love!" said Cramer, taking up the letter and reading
                  aloud, as follows:</p>

               <p>"Serena, let me stop here, and burn this foolish letter!" said the young
                  husband—"I see no use in reading it farther—it is the effusion of some romantic

               <p>HIS Eminence was seated again in his private chamber. As usual, his table was
                  covered with letters, each letter being but a connecting link in the vast chain of
                  Jesuit operations in America—and though each by itself was of minor importance,
                  yet as a <emph>whole</emph>, they were of terrible and fearful import—a bundle of
                  faggots dipped in the very brimstone of hell, only needing a spark to kindle a
                  blaze which nought but patriot blood could extinguish.</p>
               <p>As he read letter after letter, the import of the contents could be read in his
                  face. One letter he would lay aside with a smile, and rubbing the palms of his
                  lily-white hands together, would mutter, "Good—the cause is prospering!" While he
                  read another, his brow would grow dark as a thunder-cloud, and the purple blood
                  would rise to his cheeks, while he muttered—"Curse the heretics! curse them—they
                  may triumph for a while, but then <emph>our</emph> time will come, and we will
                  have <emph>blood</emph> for insult, vengeance for their temporary contumacy!"</p>
               <p>Letter after letter was read and passed over—letters from the north and the south,
                  the east and the west; and yet half had not been opened, when the confidential

               <p>A few moments passed, and again the door opened. Morrison entered—not the

                  said his Eminence. "But how came this sudden death of the widow Montressor? Had
                  thy hand ought to do with it?"</p>
               <p>"It had!" said the priest unblushingly. "But without evil <emph>intention:</emph>
                  I acted for the good of the Holy Church and the Sacred Order of Jesus! I ask for
                  absolution."</p>
               <p>"Absolve te!" muttered the priest, "in nomine PATER, et FILI et ESPIRITU SANCTO.
                  The end justifieth the deed! Thou art a true and faithful son of the Church."</p>
               <p>The priest crossed himself with a mock humility, knelt and kissed the hand of his
                  superior, and then rising, said:</p>
               <p>"What will I do with the girl, Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"You say she is very beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, few women are fairer than she. Perfect in form—in feature
                  classical and intelligent, and as pure as the snow-drop blooming in the wintry
                  atmosphere of March."</p>
               <p>"Bring her here—bring her here! I will have her under my own eye." said the
                  priest, his eye flashing as he spoke, perchance with the vision of beauties
                     <emph>imagined</emph> before they were <emph>seen</emph>."</p>

               <p>Reader, dropping without warning, the curtain upon the above scene, we will at
                  once change it to THE DEATH-ROOM.</p>
               <p>There is something soul-chilling and awful in a death-room—in a room where a
                  soulless corpse lies stiff and stark before you. Something terrible in the
                  stiffened eye-lids, laying like dark pencillings from the lids of the sealed eyes
                  down on the marble-cold, white cheeks—the limbs stiff and rigid, as if frozen by
                  the frosts of winter. I have seen such, and the blood grew chill in my veins as I
                  gazed upon them. Yes, grew chill—my cheek blanched and my heart sighed, and I have
                  wept as a child weeps when it has lost its mother. Yet, on the red battle-field I
                  have seen warm friends totter and fall and <emph>die</emph>, while their souls
                  rushed forth in gaping wounds—I have seen them fall close by my side, and maddened
                  by the sight, have rushed on to avenge them. Yet, death <emph>there</emph> was not
                  appalling—not terrible. It came in the noise and rush of excitement—it passed
                  unheeded—was not soon <emph>forgotten</emph>, yet it was not so
                     <emph>sodded</emph> in the memory, as the death which left the pale, frigid,
                  unscarred, scarce altered form before me."</p>
               <p>Ernest Cramer entered the death-room, where, extended upon sheets of snowy linen,
                  lay the body of the widow Montressor. By her side was Irene—the
                     <emph>beautiful</emph> Irene, not yet robed in black, but dressed in white—her
                  fragile form bending with the weight of woe—her cheeks blanched with the rivers of
                  tears that had passed over them.</p>
               <p>"Why did you not send for me earlier? asked Cramer.</p>
               <p>"But a few hours since she was well!" said the weeping daughter "Who could dream
                  that she would die so soon?"</p>
               <p>"Did she suffer much pain?"</p>
               <p>"None—she died as if she were going in a sweet slumber, and<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000112"/> when she called me it was only to say she felt very
                  weak—that her hands and feet were growing as cold as ice!" replied Irene.</p>
               <p>"There is a thin, white froth oozing out from her lips!" said Cramer, bending down
                  and examining the corpse. "Irene, who have you in the house?"</p>
               <p>"None but our three servants."</p>
               <p>"What are they? <emph>Catholics?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>One</emph> is—the other two are Protestants."</p>
               <p>"Irene, your mother has been <emph>poisoned</emph>." Oh, be careful of yourself.
                  At once, without delay discharge that Catholic servant—if there is proof that she
                  gave your mother any food, I will have her arrested. The <emph>Church</emph>—the
                  JESUITS—are at the bottom of this."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my mother—my dear mother!" cried the weeping girl "For <emph>what</emph>
                  could they have killed her?"</p>
               <p>"For her money—for what is now <emph>your</emph> money!" said Ernest.</p>
               <p>"Hush—hush!" said the girl, quickly. She saw the head of some one who had
                  apparently been listening by the outer window, rise and instantly disappear.</p>
               <p>"What shall I do—what <emph>shall</emph> I do! God help me!" sighed the poor
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"When the funeral is over, you must close this house and come and live under the
                  protection of my wife!" said Cramer. "She will be as a sister to you, Irene. Will
                  you come?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes, and bless God, that in my hour of sorrow, He has given me such friends!"
                  muttered the lovely girl, kissing in her fervent gratitude the hand which had
                  clasped hers.</p>
               <p>There is nothing so difficult in a novel which is <emph>founded</emph> on
                     <emph>fact</emph>, and which abounds in <emph>scenes</emph> which are true and
                  natural like its characters, and which contains many <emph>living</emph>
                  characters, which are each playing a part at the <emph>same</emph> time, as to
                  keep all of them <emph>before</emph> the reader. A <emph>fiction</emph>, if only
                     <emph>imagined</emph>, can be so plotted as to have but one or two principal
                  actors, and when one is up before you the others can be left at rest; but in a
                  drama like this, of <emph>real life</emph>, are all too busy—too constantly busy
                  to be lost sight of for a moment.</p>
               <p>Cramer had just returned from a visit to the house of death, where he had left
                  Irene Montressor weeping by the side of the mother whom God had taken but too
                  early home to Heaven. He was relating to his wife, who listened all tearfully to
                  the mournful tale, what he had witnessed, and also informing her of the invitation
                  he had extended to the poor orphan girl.</p>
               <p>"You will receive her as a sister, for my sake, will you not, my Serena?" he
                  asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and not only for <emph>your</emph> sake, dear Ernest, but for her own."</p>
               <p>"Bless you, my sweet wife—I knew such would be your answer!" and the fond
                     <emph>happy</emph> husband pressed a kiss upon his wife's fair brow.</p>
               <p>A tap at the door, caused her to start and blush, as if marriage had not yet made
                     <emph>kissing</emph> seem legal and right, though in my opinion it never comes
                  much out of the way—that is, amongst "<emph>cousins</emph>" and "good friends."
                  There is a <emph>deal</emph> of expression in a kiss, and sometimes a kiss raised
                  a deal of commotion in camp—that is, calling the human heart the camp, and what is
                     <emph>it</emph> but the head-quarters of <emph>feeling</emph> in one's body.
                  But excuse my digressions, and I'll go back to the "mysterious knocking." The tap
                  at the door was not a timid rap, such as some <emph>poor</emph> creditor gives
                  when he comes to ask the pay for labor done, and some poor friend uses when all
                  timidly he comes to borrow a V—but a bold, dun-like, official kind of a
                  rat—tat—tat-as if it said, "Open the door there—I've business with you."</p>
               <p>Ernest, however, did not pause to study who or what kind of a knocker stood at his
                  threshold; he quietly stepped toward the door a pace or so, and then said, in his
                  usual tone:</p>
               <p>"Come in!"</p>
               <p>The next moment the door opened, and Harry Hilton entered. Both advanced and
                  grasped each other by the hand.</p>
               <p>"All is <unclear>over</unclear> my dear Harry!" cried Cramer. I've been led to the
                  altar of happiness, and permitted myself to be sacrificed for the good of my
                  country, and to keep my heart from breaking."</p>
               <p>"So I see, and so I heard a week ago, by special express from a certain widow—but
                  I claim my kiss from the bride's lips," said the young soldier gaily, advancing
                  toward Serena.</p>
               <p>She gracefully, and with a smile of surpassing sweetness, extended<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000113"/> her right hand to his, but raising her left,
                  repelled gently the proffered salute, saying, in her melodious way—"It gives me
                  joy to give you the hand of friendly welcome, Mr. Hilton, and to receive your
                  congratulations, but my lips are not now my own—no kiss must press them except it
                  comes from the lips of my husband."</p>
               <p>"Hallo! Well, if this ain't a pretty reward for finding a husband for you!" said
                  the soldier, rather taken aback by her refusal. "If I'd known this, I would have
                  taken you myself, instead of letting <emph>him</emph> have you."</p>
               <p>"<emph>If</emph> you could have got me!" replied the young wife, smiling. "Women
                  cannot always be conquered like weak-walled cities, by daring soldiers."</p>
               <p>"That's true—and <emph>when</emph> conquered, they cannot <emph>always</emph> be
                  kept by the victor," said Hilton, as a flush that seemed to savor a little of
                  anger and disappointment arose in his cheek, and darkened up to his temples.</p>
               <p>"They can, if willing to remain in possession of the conqueror," said Serena, more
                  gravely. "But come, Harry, such old friends as we mustn't quarrel. I would not
                  refuse you a kiss, but I think that when a woman gives up her heart, soul and body
                  to her husband, as I have to him I love, that she cannot be too circumspect. Like
                  the smooth surface of a mirror, she stands exposed for all to gaze upon—and, like
                  it, a single <emph>breath</emph> will leave a <emph>shade</emph>."</p>
               <p>Cramer said not a word; but he looked upon the fond woman who uttered these words,
                  and in his heart of hearts he <emph>worshipped</emph> her.</p>
               <p>"You'll never have occasion to be jealous of your wife, if she acts
                     <emph>this</emph> way, Ernest," said Hilton.</p>
               <p>"I am not of a jealous disposition, Harry—but you said you had heard of my
                  marriage, by special post, from the widow-what widow did you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Who, of course, but Madame Montrose—though I've been gone but about ten days,
                  I've received near half a dozen letters. Failing in her desperate attempt to get
                  you, she seems determined to have me, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nolens
                     volens</foreign>."</p>
               <p>"When a widow makes a dead set at a man, and is <emph>determined</emph> to to have
                  him, his position is indeed dangerous—she'll conquer or die. Hadn't you better
                  give up the ship, haul down your colors and say <hi rend="i"/>Widder, I'm
                  thine—persecute me no more!' Don't you think i would be the best policy?—she has
                  broad acres, troops of darkies, and money enough to make the Astors place her on
                  their visiting list."</p>
               <p>"Ernest, do I hear <emph>you</emph> advocating a friend's marriage with the
                  argument of <emph>wealth?</emph>" cried his young wife in a tone of surprise.</p>
               <p>"No, dear love, no," he answered; "I was only in jest. I should think that the
                  reply which I gave to your father, when after he had consented to our marriage he
                  spoke of the property he intended to bestow on us, would assure you how little I
                  care for sordid gold. I told him that I sought your hand and heart without a
                  thought or wish for more—that I would rather take you as Adam took Eve to his
                  side, than to take any other woman on earth with all the wealth of the Queen of
                  Sheba."</p>
               <p>"You did, dear husband—you did. I might have known you were in jest."</p>
               <p>"I was, indeed—but Harry, have you seen little Lizzie yet?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ernest, and I have never seen any one so changed in so brief a period. It is
                     <emph>cruel</emph> for you to stay in this house."</p>
               <p>Cruel? Why, Harry?"</p>
               <p>"If your own judgment won't tell you <emph>why</emph> I've nothing to say,"
                  replied Hilton, then bowing rather coldly to both Cramer and Serena, he left the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"How strangely he acts," said the latter.</p>
               <p>"Yes—I have never known him to talk and act so before," added Cramer. "I fear some
                  of my <emph>kind</emph> friends have tried also to influence <emph>his</emph> mind
                  against me. I must see him about that. Oh, my own Serena, mine is a hard life! to
                  be forced ever, night and day, to be on my guard against a most insidious foe—a
                  cunning, intriguing, unprincipled set, who are determined to use every means to
                  ruin me. They will try to tear you from me—they are, I feel conscious, even now
                  plotting to separate us, for that alone can crush me—it will break my heart."</p>
               <p>"It can <emph>never</emph> be!" said the young wife, rising and casting her<pb
                     n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6961-00000114"/> round white arms around about his neck,
                  and kissing him fondly "<emph>True</emph> love never dies—and you selected the
                  only word which will express the term of my devotion, for the ring I wear—our
                  betrothal ring. It says '<emph>forever</emph>,' and I am <emph>thine</emph>
                  forever."</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>When Hilton left Cramer, he was passing down stairs towards the street door, and
                  had set his military cap on his head, as if about to pass into the street. But
                  when he reached the foot of the stairs, the young Italian girl, Desca del Onda,
                  looking at him with a mournful look, handed him a note. It was unsealed—he opened
                  and read it.</p>
               <p>"Your mistress wants to see me!" said he, a moment after.</p>
               <p>"Yes, noble cavalier."</p>
               <p>"Is she in the parlor?"</p>
               <p>"No, cavalier, she is not well—she is in her chamber—she bade me conduct you
                  there," replied the young girl, a blush suffusing her olive-tinged cheek.</p>
               <p>"Sick! What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"I know not, Signor, but she seems very melancholy. But one word to you, sir, now
                  that I can speak to you alone. Oh, please put Mr. Cramer on his guard; there is a
                  fearful plot working to ruin him. Bold, bad men wish to destroy him. I cannot,
                  dare not say more; but they will try and ruin him. Oh, if I could tell him what
                  they wished me to do—but I have sworn, I have sworn not to."</p>
               <p>"He can take care of himself," said Hilton, coldly, turning toward the rooms of
                  Madame Montrose, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Gulietta, the Italian
                  "cast off" of his Eminence.</p>
               <p>"What!" murmured the girl in astonishment, as the soldier passed haughtily on;
                  "are his <emph>friends</emph> false? God help him! God help him! Oh, that I had
                  not sworn; but my father forced me to swear. I will not aid them—no, never!"</p>
               <p>When Hilton entered the chamber of Madame Montrose, he saw a scene of beauty and
                  voluptuousness which was well calculated to make every man that was
                     <emph>human</emph> in passion, forget all things save that which was before
                  him. The walls of the room had been hung with gorgeous paintings of the Italian
                  and French schools; the two windows which opened in the rear were shaded by
                  curtains of delicate pink stuff, which softened and made rosy the light which fell
                  on all things within the apartment. The lady appeared to be sleeping when he
                  entered. She reclined upon an ottoman of purple velvet, her head partly supported
                  on one of her white, delicate hands, the other hand partly resting on a miniature,
                  set in a golden case, which had dropped on the velvet by her side, but not
                  concealing it entirely from view. Her dark eyes were closed, but the long lashes
                  lay dewy and trembling down toward her pale cheeks, as if she had been weeping.
                  Her hair lay in its dark glossy masses upon her lovely shoulders, and fell down,
                  partially covering a swelling bosom, which a low-necked morning-gown of white
                  muslin failed to conceal. Her attitude, and the lack of all but the simplest
                  articles of dress, exposed the outlines of her tall, queenly figure, and from
                  beneath the skirt of her short, snowy gown appeared her small feet, bare, and hued
                  like the first leaf of the bursting rose, and ancles which a sculptor would sigh
                  to copy. Her features were calm and placid; her lips slightly parted, showed two
                  rows of pearl-like teeth; her voluptuous bosom rose and fell with her gentle
                  breathings. Oh, how beautiful she looked! Had I the pen of a Byron, or a Moore, I
                  might faithfully describe her; but, alas, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Hilton gazed on this lovely picture, then, as if to avoid the enchantment, he
                  raised his eyes to the walls. Alas! there, too, beauty and voluptuousness alone
                  met his eye. His fine face grew rosy, as the flush of excited youth mantled his
                  cheeks, and rose in rubient tide to his very temples. He stepped forward. The
                  heavy Brussels carpet yielded no echo to his tread. Nearer and nearer to that
                  form, so like a reclining statue of Venus, he came. A sigh came softly deep from
                  her bosom, and the parted lips moved, as if in her dreams she murmured the name of
                  some loved one. He paused—he feared to approach nearer, yet he feared to
                  retreat—the chain of beauty was on him. His eye rested on the miniature—the
                  features lay under a ray of rosy light—<emph>could</emph> it be? He stepped
                  forward—glanced again—they <emph>were</emph> his own. He waited not to think that
                  this was all an acted part—he paused not to consider that the sleep was feigned,
                  or that<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6961-00000115"/> her charms were thus exposed
                  and enhanced by the beauties of art which surrounded her, to entrap him—without a
                  thought he yielded to the fatal charm, and kneeling by the side of the ottoman,
                  pressed a burning kiss on that lovely bosom, then another on her opening lips.</p>
               <p>With a quick start, as if terror-stricken, she half arose, and a cry of alarm was
                  half-uttered, as if she had been awakened from a deep slumber. But when she saw
                     <emph>who</emph> it was, even as he, frightened at his own temerity, was rising
                  from his knees, she threw her bare arms about his neck, and gluing her red,
                  burning lips to his own, returned, with ten-fold fire and passion, the kiss he had
                  given her.</p>
               <p>"Oh is it thee—is it thee of whom I was dreaming, my own, my
                     <emph>worshipped</emph> Henry!" she murmured—but she waited not for his reply,
                  her kisses prevented his utterance.</p>
               <p>No wonder that Hilton was dazzled, bewildered, half delirious. The low dress had
                  half dropped from those faultless shoulders—the jetty hair had been dashed back
                  from over that bosom which was fair as that to which Egypt's queen placed the Asp
                  of the Nile—her lips were murmuring broken sentences of love—his were returning
                  kiss for kiss—it was a dangerous moment</p>
               <p>Suddenly the form of Desca del Onda appeared at the door—her voice was quick and
                  alarmed—</p>
               <p>"Lady!" she cried, "His Eminence is coming up-stairs."</p>
               <p>"Keep him in the parlor: I'll be there in a moment, tell him I am dressing!" cried
                  the lady.</p>
               <p>"D—n his Eminence!" muttered Hilton—"who is he!"</p>

               <p>"QUITE a pleasant party—I might say a dom'd pleasant party will we be when His
                  Eminence comes in."</p>
               <p>This remark was made by a tall, lank, sharp-featured, cross-eyed, thin-lipped,
                  low-browed, white-haired individual, who was seated in close proximity to Judas
                  Iscariot Arnold, in the sanctum of his Eminence. Manton the gambler was also in
                  the room, and Dennis, the priest's confidential servant, also remained, as if
                  loath to leave such questionable characters alone in a room where there was
                  property which might tempt men to break the eighth commandment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Gordon—we may well say a select party, each of us at the head of our line—a
                     <emph>very</emph> select party."</p>
               <p>"Why the deil don't the mon come along—he tries ma patience!" said Gordon.</p>
               <p>"There is his tread—I've heard his step too often in my own establishment, not to
                  know it!" said the gambler.</p>
               <p>"The deil!" muttered Gordon. "I'll make a note o'that—mayhap it 'ell come useful
                  some o' these odd days!"</p>
               <p>The door opened and his Eminence entered—his face flushed, either with excitement
                  or with the fatigue of a hasty walk.</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen, I am glad to see you!" said the priest hurriedly: "Dennis, bring
                  in wine and glasses, and then leave us."</p>
               <p>The servant obeyed.</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. Gnat?" asked his Eminence, turning to Arnold.</p>
               <p>"We expect him every moment," replied the latter. "I sent him to have an interview
                  with Cramer, that he might see what state of mind the man was in, and whether he
                  could sufficiently excite his mind to induce him to perpetrate the
                     <emph>libel</emph> we wish. There is a step now in the ante-room, probably he
                  is coming."</p>
               <p>A timid rap at the door was heard. The servant opened it, and admitted an
                  individual whose small form, pale, peaked face, thin hair<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000116"/> and little grey eyes which moved restlessly in
                  their sockets would not impress a good physiognomist very favorably, at first
                  sight.</p>
               <p>"We were awaiting your coming, Mr. Gnat—what news?" said Arnold.</p>
               <p>"I've seen him," replied the new comer, in a sharp, old-maidish tone. "I've seen
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Well," said his Eminence in an impatient tone, "what was the result of the
                  interview?"</p>
               <p>"He's offish, sir, very offish. He don't like to write anything against a
                     <emph>woman</emph>, let the evil be ever so great."</p>
               <p>"Did you do as I advised you—represent how in this matter he could reach the only
                  vulnerable point of his bitter and powerful enemy, our friend Gordon here?"—</p>
               <p>"Yes; but he says, much as he hates and detests Mr. Gordon, he does not wish to
                  strike him through a third party, let that party be ever so culpable."</p>
               <p>"The mon's a fule; honor should be dropped on all matters editorial, when one's
                  enemy can be touched. Its my way, and the way of old Moses, and Mordecai, too!"
                  said Gordon, taking a pinch of snuff, and passing his box to the company.</p>
               <p>"Did you persuade him of the guilt of the party?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I told him that she was more common than the common street-walker; that your
                  friend and his enemy, Mr. Manton, had been a recipient of her favors—that I myself
                  had been also favored—that I could show him houses of ill-fame which she
                  frequented, and he could there see her likeness, ready for common exhibition. You
                  may depend upon it that I said all that <emph>could</emph> be said."</p>
               <p>"Do you think he believed you?"</p>
               <p>"He must. I carried letters of recommendation from some of the first men in the
                  city—letters of introduction from some of his own personal friends. Besides, I
                  protested my hate for Mr. Gordon so bitterly, and gave such good reasons for it,
                  that he could not well doubt my sincerity."</p>
               <p>"Did you hint that money could be made by the matter?" asked Manton</p>
               <p>"Yes, but he frowned so darkly at the mere hint, that I found I was treading on
                  dangerous ground, and stopped."</p>
               <p>"Singular mon! Dom it, he cares no more for money than as if he had a fortune in
                  his hands."</p>
               <p>"Maybe he thinks he has one in his head," said Manton, with a smile which
                  displayed his very white teeth.</p>
               <p>"We'll take care of his head, ere long!" muttered his Eminence.</p>
               <p>Then turning to Mr. Gordon, he continued: "You must do something for us, Mr.
                  Gordon. You must renew your attacks upon him in your paper; get up some new and
                  disgraceful charges, and then in the bitterness of his anger he may be induced to
                  carry out our wishes, and publish the information which Mr. Gnat has given
                  him."</p>
               <p>"But, yer Reverence, what can I say against the mon? I've lied about him now till
                  I've told everything that I could invent, and yet he takes it cool, and says my
                  known character as a common liar and libeller, is his protection. We must get up
                  something which has a <emph>semblance</emph> of truth, at least, or he'll only
                  laugh at it."</p>
               <p>"I've a plan," said Arnold, who had been sitting quietly in a study for several
                  minutes. Manton, can't you get Kate Rapids to do almost anything?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Well—she must attack him in the street; then Gordon must publish a highly-colored
                  account of it, and so publicly disgrace him by it, as to force his temper from its
                  equanimity. Then, at the proper moment, Gnat must again drop in, and my word for
                  it, he'll publish the articles we want him to. An angry man is never prudent. The
                  libel once published, we can get him arrested and put in prison by our friend the
                  Justice at the Tombs, or if bailed, make his bail very heavy, and thus we can so
                  work public feeling against him, that we can easily carry out our other aims."</p>
               <p>"Splendid idea!" said Manton.</p>
               <p>"Dom it, it'll work!" cried Gordon.</p>
               <p>"Exquisite! it is a masterpiece," said Gnat.</p>
               <p>His Eminence said nothing, but merely bowed his approval.</p>
               <p>"There's now but one thing more to be attended to," said Arnold<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000117"/> "and the object of our visit is accomplished. Mr.
                  Gordon must have money."</p>
               <p>"Aye, that's it now; that's <emph>it,</emph> 'money makes the mare go;' and money
                  is a respectable convenience—what our friend Judge Weekly could, with unusual
                  propriety call a necessary evil."</p>
               <p>"How much is wanted?" asked Manton.</p>
               <p>"I'll not take the job, and carry it all through, for less than a thousand," said
                  the editor.</p>
               <p>"Here is $500—his Eminence will doubtless share the expense, as he will the
                  benefits of the matter," continued the gambler, handing out a bill.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, you will receive my check for the amount during the day," replied the
                  priest. "And now, gentlemen, a glass of wine with you, and then you must excuse
                  me; I have business of importance this morning."</p>
               <p>The glasses were filled.</p>
               <p>"I drink to our success," said the priest.</p>
               <p>"Success!" cried the rest, draining each glass.</p>

               <p>When the widow Montrose made her appearance before his Eminence, a moment after
                  the scene which I described in the last chapter, her face still exhibited signs of
                  the confusion and passion which was there described.</p>
               <p>"You look charmingly, daughter—charmingly to-day!" said the priest, glancing at
                  her form, around which she had hurriedly folded an additional dressing-wrapper.
                  "May I ask how you have been engaged?"</p>
               <p>"My dress, Eminence, will show that I was making my toilet," replied the woman. "I
                  did not expect visitors at so early an hour."</p>
               <p>His Eminence smiled, and pointed to the military cap of Hilton, which had been
                  dropped near the door of the chamber. The face of the lady grew red with
                  blushes—her bosom heaved with agitation.</p>
               <p>"Eminence," she murmured, "Eminence, I did not—"</p>
               <p>"No excuses, child! No excuses—I am neither angry or jealous of you—if you can
                  only make <emph>him</emph> useful to our cause. You have news for me,
                  doubtless?"</p>
               <p>"None, Eminence, none—he has been absent on duty."</p>
               <p>"This Cramer is very happy with his <emph>wife?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, he seems to be."</p>
               <p>"You have not yet made her jealous?"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, I have no opportunity. She will not make my acquaintance—I cannot force
                  my attentions upon her."</p>
               <p>"Have you gained any power and sway over Hilton?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eminence, he <emph>loves</emph> me! I have won his heart.</p>
               <p>"Then, Gulietta, you must use your influence to produce a quarrel between him and
                  Cramer. I care not how bitter; if it ends in bloodshed, so much the better."</p>
               <p>"In bloodshed, Eminence?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—why do you turn pale? Are they not both <emph>heretics,</emph> whom it would
                  be a good act to destroy?"</p>
               <p>"But, Eminence, I will win Hilton within the fold of our Church. I
                     <emph>know</emph> I can sway him."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, so much the better that he quarrels with Cramer, for he will kill him
                  for us when we need have it done. He can get the other to challenge him, or in
                  some way aid us in our ends. Do as I bid you, and get up a quarrel between them.
                  And do all you can to make his wife jealous. If possible, instil into the mind of
                  Lizzie Laurel principles and feelings which will cause her with her beauty to
                  continually tempt him. Encourage her to believe that she can yet win him. Make her
                  believe that his wife only married him through mercenary and selfish motives, and
                  that if she can win him for once from the path of duty, he will love
                     <emph>her,</emph> and her only. You are the only one who <emph>can</emph> do
                  this, Gulietta—do it, and any reward in my power shall be yours. You shall even in
                  peace enjoy your new love—nay, if you can and will, shall marry him, and the
                  wealth of the supposed widow Montrose shall be all that it is reported."</p>
               <p>"I will try. Could I not use some drug on both of them to effect the object?"</p>
               <p>"I care not what you use, or how you attain the object, so that you<pb n="232-233"

                  turn all that he has done into evil. We can only put a stop to the principles he
                  has disseminated by so doing. And now, child, remember, you must do something. In
                  your own foolish love, forget not that for which you are sworn to labor. Remember
                  your oath—forget not the past in the present."</p>

               <p>"It is well. Now take yon cap to thy friend, and bid him be more careful next

               <p>IT is not to be supposed, as we are busied in revealing the various plottings of
                  the conspirators, that we can pause to tell of each incident that befell the
                  various parties; or of each little occurrence tending toward one point, and having
                  but one final aim, which darkened the pleasure-path of the newly married
                  couple.</p>
               <p>Scarce a day passed that some anonymous note did not reach Serena, implicating her
                  husband's honor or faith; often a note was so directed as to appear to be for
                     <emph>her</emph>, when in the inside it was directed to her husband, and was
                  full of extravagant expressions of love. In some notes hints were given that his
                  visits to the meetings of his Order, or the hours devoted to business, were but
                  apparent excuses to cloak his conjugal infidelity. Still other letters
                     <emph>purported</emph> to contain expressions which he had used in public
                  meetings in regard to her native land—expressions of carelessness about her love,
                  &amp;c., &amp;c. Every means which ingenuity could invent, was used in these
                  letters to influence her mind against him whom she had sworn to love. For a time
                  she showed all these letters to her husband—laughing at some, asking explanations
                  in regard to others, till he became almost tired of replying. But at last, though
                  she still read them, she saw that a continual recurrence of questions, &amp;c.,
                  pained and annoyed him, and she refrained from troubling him.</p>
               <p>The following scene occurred at a date about two-weeks later than the scene
                  described in the last chapter.</p>
               <p>Serena was seated beside her husband in his study. His face was pale, his brow
                  clouded—his eyes bright with anger. He held a letter crushed in his clenched hand,
                  and of it evidently he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, that for one <emph>instant</emph>, Serena, you can think this
                  charge has a foundation?"</p>
               <p>"Oh. Ernest, if I <emph>did</emph> think so, I would go mad—I cannot
                     <emph>think</emph> so,<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6961-00000119"/> yet see how
                  the writer recounts particulars; and it is true, Ernest, as he says, that you did
                  not come in until half past <emph>eleven</emph> o'clock last night."</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>but</emph> dearest, I was at the meeting of our Order."</p>
               <p>"What time did it close, Ernest?"</p>
               <p>"A little after ten."</p>
               <p>"That is just what the letter says, and then <emph>it</emph> accounts for an hour
                  and a half, which you have <emph>not</emph> accounted for."</p>
               <p>"Serena, do you ask of me to account for every minute of my time, as if you were
                  my sovereign or a master over a laborer? If you <emph>wish</emph> it, I will tell
                  you where I was?" said Cramer in an impatient tone.</p>
               <p>The blood rushed up in the young wife's cheeks. She hesitated for a moment, then
                  said—</p>
               <p>"If it is not too much trouble, please tell me!"</p>
               <p>"The trouble is a pleasure, <emph>madam!</emph>" said Cramer, coldly. "Upon the
                  adjournment of the meeting, I was invited by a brother of the Order, Mr. Arnold,
                  to go with him to Florence's to take a supper Remembering you, I wished to
                  decline, but he insisted upon it, stating that he wished in the meanwhile to speak
                  of matters of importance, and I yielded. Upon leaving him, I sprung into an
                  omnibus and hurried home. Is this explanation satisfactory, madam?"</p>
               <p>"I don't like that Arnold!" said the lady, not heeding Cramer's question. "He
                  looks to me like a deep, designing knave!"</p>
               <p>"His face, or rather the <emph>expression</emph> of his face, is <emph>not</emph>
                  prepossessing," said Cramer—"yet we must not judge by <emph>appearances</emph>.
                  His acts prove him to be a <emph>good man</emph>—he is very generous—gives away a
                  great deal in charity, and is one of the most zealous patriotic native Americans
                  that I ever knew. He is <emph>devoted</emph> to our cause."</p>
               <p>"Your cause," said the wife, still speaking coldly—"is not a cause which I very
                  much admire. I regret the day when you joined those Orders."</p>
               <p>"And yet, Serena, you approved of my love for my country, before we were
                     <emph>married</emph>. I made no concealment of my principles."</p>
               <p>"No—but you did not say you hated England."</p>
               <p>"Nor do I now say so. I only hate her government, which transports its paupers and
                  convicts to our shores, to fill our prisons, our poor-houses, and to burden
                  American tax-payers."</p>
               <p>"She does not send <emph>all</emph> paupers; some wealthy men come here."</p>
               <p>"True, but it is not for love of our institutions, or because they seek liberty.
                  Think you that such as Belmont, as Prince, or King, come here because they love
                  our land? No, it is because they can coin fortune upon fortune; and when they
                  retire from the business cares of life, they will go and carry all their wealth
                  with them to their native land. I almost wish with Jefferson, when I think of
                  these things, that an ocean of fire rolled between this and the old world."</p>
               <p>"Ernest, Ernest! How could you marry a foreigner, feeling thus speaking thus!"</p>
               <p>"Because I loved her, dearest!" said the husband, kissing her brow, his tone and
                  look melting from coldness down to affection.</p>
               <p>"How could you love her?" said the wife, still cold in tone and look.</p>
               <p>"Ask your own heart, dear Serena! Mesmeric influence—sympathy, fate, your beauty,
                  or something of the kind. I know not, care not why, I only know I love you with a
                  deep and wild devotion, which words, cold, senseless words, cannot describe."</p>
               <p>"Ernest, dear Ernest, it were a sin to doubt you!" said the young wife—yet as from
                  his eyes her glance fell on the crushed letter which he had dropped at his feet,
                  her smile again vanished, and a sigh came from her lips. It was evident that the
                  seeds of suspicion had been sown in her breast. How hard, alas! are they to
                  eradicate. What a strange nature does woman possess—how varied her humors. He is
                  indeed a gifted and learned man in woman-nature who understands all her phases of
                  temper—her whims, her caprices. But with all these she possesses virtues, and
                  graces, and gifts, which well entitle her to the title of God's last, best
                  gift.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>IT was night. Irene Montressor had buried her mother. Supported by Ernest Cramer
                  and his wife, she had followed the remains of her last relative to a shadowy tomb
                  beneath the cedars of lonely Greenwood. She did not shed a tear during all the
                  painful ceremony—not a sob shook her fragile but beautiful frame; not a shudder
                  trembled through her form. Pale, silent, choked with that grief which words may
                  not reveal, she passed through the trying ordeal.</p>
               <p>After the last words were said, and the marble slab was laid upon the tomb, Ernest
                  proposed that she should return with his wife to the house where they boarded.</p>
               <p>"I will come on the morrow," she murmured: "I must go home to-night."</p>
               <p>"Shall I not go and pass the night with you?" asked Serena.</p>
               <p>"No, no, kind lady; leave me to myself and my sorrow to-night: on the morrow I
                  will discharge my servants, close the house, and go to live with you."</p>
               <p>Delicacy forbade Mrs. Cramer or her husband from pressing the matter and the now
                  completely orphaned girl was left to her solitary grief.</p>
               <p>It was night, as was said above; and clad in her deep mourning, Irene Montressor
                  sat alone in the room, and for the first time since her mother's death wept—wept
                  bitterly. The two Protestant servants of her late mother were by her side,
                  endeavoring to console and comfort her, but the Catholic servant was not
                  there.</p>
               <p>A low rap at the door announced a visitor.</p>
               <p>"Go and see who is there, Harriet!" said Irene.</p>
               <p>The woman obeyed—but started back with a scream of terror, as a man robed in
                  black, from head to foot, and whose face was hidden with a mask of crape, entered.
                  He was followed by six more men dressed like himself.</p>
               <p>"What want ye here in the house of mourning?" cried Irene, rising, not terrified
                  and screaming like her servant, but dignified even in her alarm. "If ye are
                  robbers, ye have chosen an ill time and a poor place for this outrage."</p>
               <p>"Seize those women and gag them before their shrieks alarm and rouse the
                  neighborhood!" said the leader to his attendants.</p>
               <p>It was done with the same quickness that his words were uttered.</p>
               <p>Then turning to Irene, the same man in a calm, deep tone, said:</p>
               <p>"Daughter, we come in the name of the Holy Mother Church to bear thee to a safe
                  asylum."</p>
               <p>"The Church has no power over me!" cried the girl. "I have renounced its
                  doctrines."</p>
               <p>"Beware—beware; we are the servants of the Inquisition!" cried the same voice.
                  "The punishment for <emph>apostacy</emph> is death by torture, and a confiscation
                  of property."</p>
               <p>"Begone—begone, or I will arouse the neighborhood. Help! help!" screamed the poor
                  girl. But in an instant her cries were stifled by a muffled cloak being cast
                  around her head—she was seized and bound, and the party of masked men bore her and
                  the two servants from the room—no one having spoken except the leader. At the
                  door, as she was carried forth, Irene saw her Catholic servant standing with a
                  lighted candle in her hand, and then she knew herself completely betrayed</p>
               <p>It was an hour later. Irene Montressor was standing alone in the same apartment in
                  the house of his "Eminence" that I described in a former chapter, as being
                  occupied by Arnold on the night when he <emph>smiled</emph> so frequently with his
                  Eminence. Her attitude was that of wretchedness and despair. Her hands, which were
                  pressed upon her aching brow, were nervously twitching—her eyes, as she looked
                  vainly around for one sign of hope, one point of egress from the den of crime and
                  infamy, were distended and brilliant with the light of terror. Her garments of
                  deep black contrasted with her death-like pallor, and<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000121"/> they were torn and disordered. Her beautiful hair
                  hung in disordered tresses down upon her bared and lovely shoulders.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God!" she murmured, "hast <emph>thou</emph> deserted the orphan?"</p>
               <p>She looked with shuddering horror on the voluptuous paintings and statues around
                  the room—things too indicative of the nature of its occupant—too indicative of a
                  fate reserved for her, which she dreaded more, far more than death. She had tried
                  the only door—it was locked. She could not open a window, they were barred and
                  secured; and from the dead silence around her, she knew she was too far removed
                  from the street to be heard by any passer-by, if she shrieked for help.</p>
               <p>Again she murmured—"Oh God of Heaven protect me!"</p>
               <p>She heard a step at the door—the key was turned, and one whom she had never seen
                  before entered. It was "his Eminence." His countenance was cold and stern, and
                  after entering he removed the key from the outside of the door, locked it, and
                  placed the key in his pocket. He then turned, and without moving, folded his arms
                  and fixed his dark eyes upon her. Her eyes, first raised in fear and expectation,
                  dropped beneath his gaze; and the color which had left her cheeks rushed in a
                  crimson volume to her face, spreading up to her very temples. For full five
                  minutes thus they stood. Then his Eminence spoke.</p>
               <p>"You are very beautiful, daughter," said he.</p>
               <p>She replied not, but a tremor passed through her frame—her breath seemed to be
                  leaving her—she looked as if about to sink powerless, senseless to the floor.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>very</emph> beautiful!" he repeated. "Hast thou ever
                     <emph>loved?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir," she cried, in a tone so sweetly imploring that it should have melted
                  the heart of a fiend,—"Oh, sir, if you are, as your garb indicates, a minister of
                  God, I pray you to release me—let me go home. I have never harmed any one—why
                  should I be thus treated?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Thus treated,</emph> child! Is it treating thee badly to take thee from the
                  dangers of the sinful world, and bring thee under our own protection? Here shalt
                  thou live like a queen—here command every luxury—here safely enjoy pleasures
                  unseen by the world, which a cold and censorious world uncharitably condemn. See
                  what luxury here surrounds you—see that art and wealth have been united to make
                  this chamber a fitting home for beauty like thine. Say, child, wilt thou not be my
                  own one? Here thou shalt be queen—this shall be thy world—I thy only subject. Say,
                  fair child, shall not this be?"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, he advanced toward her.</p>
               <p>Then, and not till then, did Irene become herself. With stern dignity, her frown
                  seemed to swell in height and volume—her eyes flashed with indignation, and
                  raising her hand she waved him back.</p>
               <p>"Stand off, hypocrite; stand back!" she cried.</p>
               <p>"By all the saints, thou art queenly!" he cried; "thou shalt be mine, either
                  willingly or unwillingly!"</p>
               <p>"Never! I am not helpless!" she cried. "Lay but one hand upon my person, and thou
                  shalt see what a true <emph>woman</emph> can do to preserve her honor."</p>
               <p>With a sneering laugh, the priest advanced. Irene moved not, but her white hand
                  plucked a gleaming dagger from its hiding-place in her bosom; and raising it high
                  above her head, stood like an Amazon in anger, ready to plunge it into his breast
                  or her own.</p>
               <p>The priest hesitated, then stopped in his advance, his face purpled with combined
                  anger and passion.</p>
               <p>"Fools, cursed fools were they, not to search thee and take away such dangerous
                  playthings!" he cried.</p>
               <p>Then in a tone of more gentleness, he said:</p>
               <p>"This is folly, child. I mean thee no harm. Put up thy weapon, and sit down and
                  talk to me."</p>
               <p>"Never, until you have left this room. Release me from this place, and I will go
                  forth and never utter one word to expose this cruel wrong. But at your peril will
                  you confine me here. Beware of a desperate woman!"</p>
               <p>The priest smiled. "This will not do; force is useless here," he muttered in an
                  under tone. "Cunning, alone, can conquer her; drugs must be used, else she
                     <emph>might</emph> do damage with her dagger."</p>
               <p>Then raising his voice, he said: "I will leave thee, daughter. I did this only to
                  try thy virtue. I would not for the world do thee an<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000122"/> injury. Thou shalt now be removed to an apartment
                  more suitable to thy refined and delicate taste; and there, in quiet and happy
                  seclusion, with books and music, and birds and flowers to amuse thee, thou shalt
                  enjoy life, free from interruption or care."</p>
               <p>"Why not let me go to my home, if you are my friend?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"You have no home, daughter. Left an orphan in this bad world, it becomes the
                     <emph>duty</emph> of 'Holy Mother Church' to take thee under her protecting
                  shadow, to preserve for good purposes, and thy own comfort, the fortune thy mother
                  left thee, lest some <emph>heretic</emph> should take thee and it, and use both to
                  the perversion of religion and our power."</p>
               <p>"Then I am to consider myself a prisoner?"</p>
               <p>"To a certain extent, yes;" replied the priest. "But when we find you willing to
                  abide by our rules, and to act as do the rest of our household, then thou shalt be
                  free, and happy, too, as a bird which all the livelong day flies about among the
                  trees and flowers, and at night returns with its mate to its nest. I will leave
                  thee, child, and a trusty female of our Order, a sister, will conduct thee to
                  other and more pleasant apartments. Thy own wardrobe will be brought to thee, and
                  thou wilt soon cease to regret the world and its cold vanities."</p>
               <p>The priest now left the room, but as he crossed its threshold he murmured, "She
                  shall be mine—she shall be mine!"</p>
               <p>Immediately after he left the room, poor Irene, who had borne up well till then,
                  burst into tears, and sank back upon an ottoman, helpless as an infant. The dagger
                  dropped from her nerveless hand—her bosom heaved with sobs—she was again the weak,
                  despairing, wretched girl.</p>
               <p>A few moments only elapsed, when a woman—a good-looking woman of thirty-five or
                  forty years of age, entered the room. She was of a voluptuous, sensual cast of
                  figure, and her face tallied well with her form. She stepped lightly across the
                  room, and picked up the dagger that lay upon the carpet. This she placed beneath
                  the pillow of her couch, and then she returned to the side of Irene, who as yet
                  had not observed her.</p>
               <p>"Do not weep, dear child!" said she in a kindly tone. 'Do not weep—behold in me a
                  sister and a friend."</p>
               <p>Irene raised her head, saw that one of her own sex was before her, and casting her
                  arms around her, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Oh save me—save me from worse than death! Aid me in leaving this terrible
                  place!"</p>
               <p>"I fear his Eminence, but I <emph>will</emph> be thy friend, poor girl!" said the
                  woman.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God bless you for those words!" cried Irene, kissing the red sensual lips of
                  the woman as fondly as if she had been a mother, instead of being what she was, a
                  tool of the Jesuit General.</p>
               <p>They left the room.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <p>IT was a later hour on the same day. His Eminence was seated in the private parlor
                  of Mrs. Laurel. That lady was seated by his side, her hand held in his, but on her
                  face was an expression of horror, indicating that he had said something which
                  pained or terrified her, as was also indicated by this expression from her
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"<emph>What!</emph> Oh, Eminence, did I hear that from you? Sell the virtue of my
                  own child—give her to the arms of a married man, who could never repair the injury
                  done?"</p>
               <p>"All things done for the good of the Church, are <emph>right!</emph>" said the
                  expositor of <emph>true</emph> Jesuit doctrines.</p>
               <p>"But spare, oh Eminence, spare my child. It would kill me to see her dishonored—to
                  know that she had become the leman of a heretic!"</p>
               <p>"She shall be his <emph>wife</emph>," said the priest. "Through this very act on
                  her part, I will cause his divorce—that is, if she can make him <emph>fall</emph>.
                  Even if she cannot, he shall lose the woman he now dotes upon, for I will make her
                  hate him!"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, I dare not disobey you," she murmured.</p>
               <p>"Then send thy child here—I will give her instructions how to act—for conquer she
                  must!" said the priest.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Laurel arose, and retired to obey the order.</p>
               <p>His Eminence <emph>smiled</emph> after Mrs. Laurel left the room—not in a
                     "<emph>white-coat-ative</emph>" sense, but with a sneering, fiendish chuckle,
                  as if triumphing over the approaching success of his object.</p>
               <p>"It will work!" he muttered. "It will work. We will crush this serpent, Cramer,
                  and then destroy the eggs he has laid, ere they are hatched to bring forth
                  millions of opposers to the progress of our Society. We will crush
                     <emph>him</emph>, and send him with a blackened name and blighted fame,
                  down—down to hell—if there be a hell!"</p>
               <p>Why that pause, and why that "<emph>if</emph>" in the exclamation of his Eminence?
                  Could it be possible that he doubted in both a hell and a heaven? Could it be that
                  he, who through terror of that hell and hopes of that heaven, or rather through
                  threats of the pains of the one, and promises of the joys of the other, holds
                  thousands of fanatical, bigoted beings at his beck, ready in <emph>all
                     things</emph> to do his Bidding, was himself an INFIDEL? Yes, and to the
                  fullest extent. What cares he for religion, only to use it as a means of advancing
                  his sect, or gaining power and wealth, merely that both might minister to his
                  pleasures, and advance his position. Oh, Americans, wake up to the danger of
                  fostering and harboring these insidious, infamous Jesuits here in our Republican
                  land. They have been driven from all other climes for their interference with
                  their governments—they are now at work with ours; beware, or soon it will be too
                  late! <emph>Too late?</emph> Yes—if things progress for ten years—if Jesuit
                  progress gains ground as rapidly for ten succeeding years as it has for the past
                     <emph>six months</emph>—a PAPAL EMPIRE will have arisen on the ruins of this
                  Republic. Its ashes, smoking with the blood of martyred millions, will be all that
                  will be left of American liberty. Wake up—wake up, ere the spirit of Washington
                  curses you for your supineness. I write where HE once stood—I write this near that
                  spot where HIS sacred remains repose; and I feel, oh I <emph>feel</emph> as if the
                  spirit of prophecy was on me—as if a power from above bade me write, and warn and
                  implore my fellow countrymen to awake ere it is too late!</p>
               <p>His Eminence, after muttering the sentence above recorded, paced to and fro for
                  several minutes, ever and anon casting an impatient glance at the door, as if
                  expectant of the entrance of Lizzie.</p>
               <p>Full ten minutes passed, and she came not.</p>
               <p>"God's malison on the girl! why comes she not?" muttered the priest.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and she entered. She looked beautiful, robed in an evening
                  undress of white muslin. Her fragile form seemed graceful in the extreme, draped
                  as it was in the scanty garb she wore. But her eyes looked heavy and swollen. She
                  had evidently been weeping.</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6961-00000124"/>
               <p>"Child," said his Eminence, as she came forward, "what is the matter? Why hast
                  thou been so long delaying our command for thy appearance?"</p>
               <p>"Holy Father," she murmured, "forgive me. My mother has been talking with me."</p>
               <p>"And thou hast been weeping, child. Why hast thou wept?"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Father, but ask me not."</p>
               <p>"Child, thou listenest to God's anointed. Conceal nothing from me—reveal all."</p>
               <p>"Father—<emph>Holy</emph> Father, forgive me, I cannot."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Child!</emph>" cried the priest, in a tone which made her tremble from head
                  to foot, "behold in me the head of the Catholic Church in America. Dare not, for
                  your soul's salvation, to refuse me aught I ask, be it your inmost secrets. your
                  silent thoughts, or even that which the innocent most prize."</p>
               <p>A deep and burning blush suffused the cheek of the poor girl, yet she made no
                  reply. Her form quivered in every limb. His Eminence marked the effect of his
                  words, smiled, then kindly said:</p>
               <p>"Sit down, sweet Lizzie, I have that to say to thee, which will make thee
                  happy."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Happy?</emph>" sighed the fair girl, as she sat down.</p>
               <p>"Yes, happy," continued the priest. "Lizzie, you love Ernest Cramer."</p>
               <p>"Indeed—<emph>indeed</emph> I do!" cried the girl. "Yet it is hopeless, it is
                     <emph>madness</emph>—he is <emph>married.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Poh, child, he can easily be unmarried. He does not love her to whom he is
                  wedded."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, you wrong him. He is too pure, too true-hearted to wed one whom he did
                  not love—too honorable to wrong one whom he did not mean to wed."</p>
               <p>"True, fair child; but could not he, like others, mistake his own mind and his own
                  feelings?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, not with me, sir! He <emph>knows</emph> I love him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, child, he does; and now, <emph>too late</emph>, he knows that she to whom he
                  is wedded does not love him."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Not</emph> love him? How can she help it? He is ever kind and gentle, brave
                  and manly toward all our sex."</p>
               <p>"She is a foreigner. His Native American principles disagree with her national
                  prejudices, and her foreign relatives are each hour trying to poison her mind
                  against him, and draw her away."</p>
               <p>"Will they succeed? Will she desert him and leave him alone?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>hope</emph> so," said the priest.</p>
               <p>"Hope so, Father?" cried the astonished girl. "Are you too his enemy?"</p>
               <p>"No, child, I am his best, his truest friend. I wish to save his soul—to bring him
                  within the pale of mother Church, and to make him happy. There is but one way to
                  do this—thou must do it, and thy reward shall be his <emph>love</emph> and his
                     <emph>hand</emph>."</p>
               <p>"His love—his hand?" murmured the girl. "Oh, that were impossible. He
                     <emph>pities</emph> me. One cannot love that which he <emph>pities</emph>."</p>
               <p>"You err, child. Love is begotten of many causes. It often arises from pity, or
                  from a sympathy, which when rightly understood, amounts to pity. When the Indian
                  Princess Pocahontas fell in love with Smith, it was when she saw the white warrior
                  about to be executed. Love is often made more fervent, or from a mere spark fanned
                  into flame, by a knowledge that one is loved, and a grateful <emph>return</emph>
                  is <emph>natural</emph>."</p>
               <p>"And you think I can yet win his love—his hand?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child."</p>
               <p>"No, no, it cannot be. He is already <emph>married</emph>."</p>
               <p>"But his bonds can easily be broken. He was not married according to the rules of
                  our Church. A divorce can easily be brought about."</p>
               <p>"That would render them unhappy," said the fair young girl—"I would not wish
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Poh! they are already unhappy, I tell thee. She loves him not—he knows it, and is
                  already wretched."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that I could comfort him!"</p>
               <p>"You can, child, you must. For you it has been reserved to do a good and holy
                  work, which in the end will conduce to your happiness<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000125"/> ness. Through you, a divorce must be produced
                  between him and his wife—through this and his consequent troubles, he will be
                  brought into the pale of holy mother Church, and then his hand and his grateful
                  love shall be your reward."</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Father," cried the girl eagerly—"tell me, Father, how can this be
                  done?"</p>
               <p>"You must forget your maiden modesty—you must cast yourself in his way, and by
                  your conduct induce him to make you his mistress."</p>
               <p>A burning blush in an instant suffused the beautiful girl's face; then the red
                  blood, retreating back to her astonished heart, left her cheeks pale as Parian
                  marble. She looked as if she would reply, but she could not speak. With her whole
                  form quivering as with fear or horror, she turned to leave the room.</p>
               <p>"Stay, child!" said the priest, sternly. "Stay, I command thee, and hear all! The
                  end justifieth the deed—in this matter the Church will justify and absolve thee,
                  and his marriage to thee will take away all stain before men.'</p>
               <p>"Father," at last she said—"Father, you do not know Ernest Cramer. He
                     <emph>never</emph> would wrong a poor girl like me—he is too honorable to do
                  such a deed—I <emph>know</emph> he is."</p>
               <p>"Poh, child! you know but little of human nature. Honor is behind where passion
                  stands before it. He can be conquered and—"</p>
               <p>'Then, Father, if <emph>he</emph> can be conquered, which I doubt, <emph>I</emph>
                  cannot! I <emph>love</emph> him dearly, <emph>truly</emph>—but I could not become
                  that which you wish me to."</p>
               <p>"Not even to win him as your lawful husband?"</p>
               <p>"No, Father."</p>
               <p>"Then," said the priest, in an assumed tone of carelessness, "I will find another
                  who is as beautiful, and less scrupulous, who will carry out the will of the
                  Church. I know another who will succeed as well."</p>
               <p>"Another? Oh, my God! he must not love <emph>another</emph>," murmured the girl.
                  "Oh, Father, cannot I win him without disgrace?"</p>
               <p>"Child, disgrace is <emph>not</emph> disgrace if incurred in the path of duty
                  Besides, ere the disgrace, as you term it, is widely known, his marriage to thee
                  will wipe it away forever."</p>
               <p>"But, Father, I know his <emph>honor</emph>. He will never be dishonorable."</p>
               <p>"Even <emph>then</emph>, all is not lost. His wife can/be made jealous—you can,
                  when called upon in open court, swear that he has seduced you, even if he has
                  not."</p>
               <p>"What, Father, commit perjury?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, child—it is not wrong if done for the good of the Church."</p>
               <p>"But <emph>then</emph> he would hate and despise me forever."</p>
               <p>"No, he would love you the more, when he learned that you had done so to relieve
                  him from his bond to his cold and cruel wife—that your <emph>love</emph> alone had
                  prompted you."</p>
               <p>"Is his wife cold and cruel? She seems fond and loving."</p>
               <p>"Child, do you doubt <emph>me?</emph> I have reasons for all I say. I
                     <emph>know</emph> that she has quarrelled with him, and used bitter words this
                  very day."</p>
               <p>The sophistry and the declarations of the priest had the desired effect. The girl
                  remained silent for a little while, then said:</p>
               <p>"Father, I resign myself to thy guidance. It is a fearful risk—yet I would die to
                  win <emph>his</emph> love."</p>
               <p>"You shall live, and live for happiness, child," said the priest, with a pleasant
                  smile. "One so lovely as thou art, was formed for happiness. Thou art truly
                     <emph>beautiful!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The priest's dark eyes gleamed with a more intense brilliancy as he uttered these
                  words; and as she stood close before him, he reached suddenly forward, and before
                  she could divine his intention, caught her in his arms and pressed a burning,
                  sensual kiss on her pure lips.</p>
               <p>A scream of terror burst from the poor girl—but the next instant a manly arm was
                  around her waist, and she found herself freed from the grasp of the priest, who
                  lay upon the floor, struck down by the hand of Ernest Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Oh, thank God it is you—it is you!" murmured the poor girl, and fainted.</p>
               <p>The priest, only struck down, and not senseless from the blow, sprang to his feet,
                  livid with rage, drawing a gleaming dagger from beneath his vesture as he rose,
                  and looking as if about to spring upon<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6961-00000126"/>
                  his foe. While with his left arm Cramer placed the girls form behind him, so as to
                  save her from danger, he coolly drew a revolver from his pocket, and presenting
                  it, cried: "Advance one step, most holy, reverend and <emph>pure</emph> Father,
                  and a kick from this colt shall reward your temerity. I know your 'Eminence,' and
                  this <emph>dastardly</emph> deed shall not go unrewarded. This is your
                     <emph>religion!</emph> Out upon you for a false hound!"</p>
               <p>The priest ground his teeth in impotent rage. His basilisk eye glittered with the
                  fire of hate, and yet he dared not attack his foe. That clear, calm, blue eye was
                  fixed upon him—that hand which poised the deadly barrel did not quiver—the finger
                  which rested lightly on the trigger was as nerveless as if it were made of marble.
                  A smile—a cold, triumphant smile, rested on Cramer's features.</p>
               <p>His Eminence trembled. He felt that he was in the presence of his
                     <emph>master</emph>.</p>
               <p>At this moment Mrs. Laurel entered. She screamed as she saw the position of the
                  parties.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not harm his Eminence!" she cried. "Do not slay him—it would be a
                     <emph>mortal</emph> sin."</p>
               <p>"Is it not a mortal sin for him to insult your child? Take care of her!" said
                  Cramer, bitterly</p>
               <p>The woman took Lizzie in her arms, and was about to leave the room, when his
                  Eminence spoke.</p>
               <p>"I meant the child no harm," he said. "I did but rifle a kiss from her fair lips,
                  when this young—"</p>
               <p>"Beware, sir, call me no names, or I'll choke the words in your throat!"</p>
               <p>"When this young gentleman," continued the priest, "interrupted me with a blow
                  which felled me to the floor. But," he added with assumed meekness, "I forgive
                  him, it is a <emph>Christian's</emph> duty to do so."</p>
               <p>"And a <emph>priest's</emph> duty to kiss all the pretty girls in his parish, eh?"
                  said Cramer, with a sneer.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Cramer, please do not offend his Eminence. <emph>Please</emph> leave us.
                  I know he did not <emph>mean</emph> any harm."</p>
               <p>"Madam, I mean no disrespect to you—am not in the habit of ever using such
                  language as this in <emph>any</emph> company, but I can't help saying
                     <emph>d—n</emph> his Eminence! And now, sir, this word to you! I shall leave
                  you to settle this affair with Mrs. Laurel—but <emph>beware</emph>, if by word,
                  thought, or deed, you injure that young girl, I'll cut off both your ears and nail
                  them to your own altar!"</p>
               <p>Turning on his heel, and exchanging a look with Lizzie, who now had regained her
                  feet, he left the room, followed by her.</p>
               <p>"The <emph>devil!</emph>" muttered his Eminence, when only he and Mrs. Laurel
                  remained in the room. "I only kissed the child—should have done nothing more, and
                  that infernal heretic must rush in and fell me like an ox. He is a hard-handed
                  wretch—my temple rings like a cracked bell yet."</p>
               <p>"And to think that your Eminence should be struck in <emph>my</emph> house!"
                  murmured Mrs. Laurel. "I will instantly bid him seek board elsewhere!"</p>
               <p>"No—not for the world, daughter!" cried the priest. "That would lessen my
                  opportunities for revenge. No, he must remain here. In truth, upon a second
                  thought, this will even further our object. Lizzie will now love him better than
                  ever. But they must not confer, or she may tell him all I have said to her. Hurry
                  and interrupt their conference, and getting her alone, enjoin upon her eternal
                  secrecy, as she values her soul's salvation. Then return to me—I have further
                  directions for you."</p>

               <p>ERNEST CRAMER was seated in his chair by his writing table, ga zing with a mingled
                  air of pain and surprise at his young wife, who with an evidently angry
                  countenance, was pacing rapidly to and fro in the room. In her hand she held
                  several letters, and her voice was bitter in its expression.</p>
               <p>"All these reports and all these letters cannot be without <emph>some</emph>
                  foundation, sir!" she cried.</p>
               <p>"On my soul, Serena, if you harbor one suspicion of my truth you
                     <emph>wrong</emph> me! I never am absent an hour from your side that I do not
                  account for the cause of my absence, and tell you where I have gone to!"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, of course—it is just as this letter, signed 'S. A.,' says; you say you go
                  to a meeting of your Order. There is but one thing, Ernest, that will satisfy
                  me—one thing will make me happy!"</p>
               <p>"What is it, Serena? All that an honorable man and a fond, true husband
                     <emph>can</emph> do to make a wife happy, that will I do for you."</p>
               <p>"Then leave those American Orders. You ought never to have joined them, when you
                  must have known that I, as an English woman, could not endure them. Leave them,
                  and we will never again have an unpleasant word."</p>
               <p>"Serena!" said Cramer, slowly and sadly—"Serena, you ask that which I cannot do.
                  Had I ten thousand lives, I would lay them down in the cause which I have
                  espoused—I never can, never will desert it. Anything else you wish me to do, I
                  will do, but I <emph>never will be unfaithful to my pledges as an
                  American!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then, Ernest, I fear the day is not far distant when we shall separate!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Separate?</emph>" cried the astonished husband. "Oh my God, is this
                     <emph>you</emph>, Serena! You know not how madly, how deeply, how devotedly I
                  love you. To lose you would kill me! I could not live without you!"</p>
               <p>"And yet you refuse me a simple request."</p>
               <p>"You demand that which would be a sacrifice of my honor. Ask my <emph>life</emph>,
                  rather than that."</p>
               <p>"Well, as you please. I will answer this letter which asks an interview."</p>
               <p>"You will, Serena? Will you hold intercourse with one who acknowledges herself to
                  be a lost and fallen woman?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will be <emph>satisfied!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Do so, then, dear Serena. Conscious of right, I fear nothing. But I feel that a
                  deep-laid conspiracy is working to destroy our happiness; oh, for the sake of our
                  yet unborn babe, let me implore you not to be hasty. Serena, I <emph>love</emph>
                  you, will love you truly <emph>forever!</emph> Even should you desert me, my love
                  shall follow you; should you hate and spurn me from your side, I would die praying
                  God to bless you—your name the last on my lips."</p>
               <p>"Bless you, Ernest, bless you for <emph>such</emph> love!" cried the young wife,
                  as a tear started from her eye. "This is our first quarrel—it shall be the last. I
                  was wrong to let these foolish and scandalous reports make me angry. Forgive
                  me!"</p>
               <p>A long, fond, passionate kiss was the only reply Ernest gave, as he pressed her
                  fondly to his breast. Reader, we're intruding on domestic privacy; let's put on
                  our hats and travel into another chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>ONCE more in the gorgeous chamber of his Eminence—the chamber once inhabited for a
                  night by Judas Iscariot Arnold—lately the scene of Irene Montressor's resistance
                  to the intended wrong of the hypocritical Jesuit—that room so voluptuous in
                  furniture and in its ornaments. The fountain on its farther side was bubbling
                  forth its cooling music, the rosy light of early day was stealing in through the
                  scarlet window-curtains—everything seemed as before. But look! On yonder couch
                  behold a picture. The form of a young and lovely girl is covered by the
                  disarranged, but snow-white counterpane. Her face is pale, pale as Parian marble,
                  and her hair streams in dishevelled locks over it, and down upon her uncovered
                  neck and bosom. What is that mark upon her shoulders—see the red spots where the
                  blood has started from beneath the pearl-white skin. It looks as if the teeth of
                  some insatiate <emph>beast</emph> had there been fixed—and so they had. She
                  sleeps, and yet her sleep is not the sleep of nature. Better for that poor girl
                  that it were the sleep of death. There is something fearful in contemplating her
                  appearance as she lay there—something that tells us <emph>wrong, terrible wrong
                     has been done here</emph>.</p>
               <p>Who is she? Reader, scarcely need I tell you that Irene Montressor is before
                  you—Irene, the orphan; and that she is the victim of the "Holy Order of Jesus;"
                  that his "Eminence" has fulfilled his threat; and that she is laying there, a
                  drugged and helpless being, unconscious as yet of her own shame, of her own
                  wretchedness. See her as she moves her arms convulsively and uneasily—see her lips
                  move—hear what she says: "Mother! mother!"</p>
               <p>Alas! no mother, no father, no brother has she; and had she them it is too
                  late—they might revenge, but could not <emph>save</emph> her.</p>
               <p>And yet she <emph>is</emph> beautiful. Her disordered dress expose charms which we
                  may not pause to gaze upon; her features, pale as they are, still are exquisitely
                  handsome. She looks like a statue, fresh from a master hand, expressing that which
                  poesy and the artist's skill alone could tell.</p>
               <p>But a change is coming. See, his Eminence enters the door; he has just taken a
                  bath, and coming from the skillful hands of his valet, looks as fresh and pleasant
                  as if he had never known debauchery or crime. He advances to the side of the
                  couch. Hear that "Father of the Church," see his sensual countenance flush up with
                  the base tide of mere earthly passion.</p>
               <p>"By Heaven! she <emph>is</emph> beautiful!" he mutters. "I must kiss that
                  beautiful bosom. Ah, there is blood upon her neck. In my wild delirium, I must
                  have left that cruel mark there. But it matters not; I have been blest, and
                     she—<emph>oh</emph>, how beautiful she is!"</p>
               <p>As he uttered these words, the sacrilegious wretch bowed his burning lips and
                  kissed her fair bosom.</p>
               <p>"Ah! she shudders. She will soon awake. It is time the drug had lost its
                  influence."</p>
               <p>Saying this, the priest took some water from a vase standing near the couch, and
                  gently bathed her brow.</p>
               <p>Her eyes slowly opened; at first they closed again, and a convulsive tremor passed
                  through her frame; then again they opened, wider and wider, as they were fixed
                  upon him, until they glared fearfully, wildly upon him. Glancing from him, around
                  that too-well remembered room, then at the couch whereon with dishevelled garments
                  she lay, that wretched girl seemed in one instant to comprehend
                  <emph>all</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Lost, <emph>lost</emph>, LOST!" she shrieked. "Oh GOD! THOU hast deserted
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Be calm, daughter," said the priest. "Calm thyself, and all will be well."</p>
               <p>"Monster! Oh, in mercy kill me! I will not live on earth a polluted, lost and
                  degraded thing."</p>
               <p>The priest smiled, that same cold, sneering, fiendish smile, which I have before
                  described.</p>
               <p>"Daughter, talk not of death. We will both live for happiness yet;" and he bent
                  forward to again kiss her snowy bosom.</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6961-00000129"/>
               <p>Starting back, she half arose in the couch, and as she did so, a cry of joy arose
                  from her lips. What could it mean? Has the reader forgotten the dagger which the
                  servant, picking up from the floor, had carelessly concealed beneath the pillows
                  of that couch? Upon this, all unknowing of its vicinity, had the ruined girl
                  placed her hand With the heart of a Roman virgin beating in her desecrated bosom,
                  she hailed this <emph>friend</emph> with joy; and, while yet the priest wondered
                  at her cry of joy, she dashed the bright blade to the very hilt in her bosom.</p>
               <p>In vain did he try to arrest the blow; and as he with trembling hand drew forth
                  the fatal weapon, the red blood sprang, as if from a fountain, up into his
                  face.</p>
               <p>He groaned, and fell back fainting upon the floor. Minutes passed, but she could
                  not count them. She had gasped only the word "mother!" and had
                  <emph>died</emph>.</p>
               <p>The priest arose, looked upon his garments stained with her pure blood, and not
                  without a shudder, hurried to the fountain to wash the stains from his face. He
                  returned to the side of the couch, and there more calmly gazed upon the victim of
                  his insatiate passion. He spoke. Were his words syllables of regret? No; with his
                  fiendish heart, he only said: "<emph>It is well: her fortune is now ours—a false
                     will and document stating that she has retired to an European convent for life,
                     will settle all legally, and she and her fortune are both taken care of.</emph>
                  But she <emph>is</emph> beautiful! I did not intend she should die so
                     <emph>soon</emph>."</p>
               <p>Ringing the bell, his Eminence paced to and fro until it was answered. His
                  confidential servant replied to the summons.</p>
               <p>"Dennis," said the priest, "yonder foolish girl has killed herself. Take her body
                  to the cellar-vault, as usual, put plenty of quick-lime, and let her pass into
                  dust!"</p>
               <p>The servant merely bowed his reply, taking the matter as cool as his master—a fact
                  that would argue that such scenes were not very uncommon in that house.</p>
               <p>Thus died poor IRENE MONTRESSOR. Thus did the "Society" rid itself of the only two
                  incumbrances upon an estate which it coveted. Behold the effect of Jesuit power!
                  behold its utter lack of principle, and <emph>dread</emph> its influence and its
                  power! It has but one aim, and that is to <emph>enslave</emph> the world—to build
                  up an empire on the ashes of this Republic.</p>

               <p>"WELL, we've got him—we've got him, now!"</p>
               <p>This expression was made use of by Judas Iscariot Arnold, as he entered the
                  sanctum of his Eminence, a short time after the occurrence last related.</p>
               <p>"How, what mean you, my good friend?"</p>
               <p>"He has been arrested for libel."</p>
               <p>"Who, Cramer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and the whole morning papers are teeming with articles condemning him. He
                  will stand no chance, for he cannot prove the truth of what <emph>we</emph> have
                  caused him to utter. This is but the first step. The next move to get him degraded
                  before community, will be to get a common woman of the town to attack and strike
                  him in the street. Then I am taking rapid measures to get up a work, purporting to
                  be his life and adventures, in which he will be charged with every crime; and
                  through all this, we will so <emph>create</emph> public sentiment, that his trial
                  can only result in one way, and that way will be in his condemnation!"</p>
               <p>"But this book, will it not carry its own condemnation? In our last interview, you
                  told me that there was no court record against him—that, although in his life of
                  adventures two men have fallen by his hand, he has in both cases acted only in
                  self-defence, after forbearing as long as human nature could endure attack; that
                  you could find no <emph>record</emph> of <emph>crime</emph> against him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I so told your Eminence, and so it is. But your Eminence is aware how ready
                  the world is to hear ill of any one—how much sooner it will receive evil report
                  than good. It is but necessary to publish these things, and six out of every ten,
                  aye, eight out of ten of those who do not <emph>know</emph> him, will believe them
                  to be as true as holy writ. Believing this, they will influence the others, and
                  soon our enemy will stand helpless and friendless, and we will conquer. We will
                  heap back the injuries he has done us, with tenfold weight upon his head, and
                  teach him how dangerous it is to attack the wealthy, even if they are criminal;
                  how foolish it is for a lone man to cross the path of an Order so powerful as
                  yours."</p>
               <p>"What a mind—or, if I may say so, what a <emph>genius</emph> for plotting
                  villany!" said his Eminence, as he listened with admiration to the cool exposure
                  of Arnold's plans. "Is the man in prison?"</p>
               <p>"No, he gave bail at once."</p>
               <p>"Why did they not put his bail so high that nobody would bail him? They should
                  have locked him up."</p>
               <p>"They could not. The magistrate more than doubled the usual bail, as it was,
                  asking $2,000, which was given at once."</p>
               <p>"When will his trial come on?"</p>
               <p>"Very soon. We must hurry up matters, for if the people get time to
                     <emph>think</emph>, and he has a chance to contradict these reports, a
                  re-action may take place, and our labor will not only be all lost, but he will
                  stand higher than before in community."</p>
               <p>"Well, well; we will leave all to you. Do you need more money?"</p>
               <p>"No; Manton and his associates are so rejoiced at the success of our scheme, that
                  they advanced me three thousand dollars this morning, towards carrying it through.
                  That will suffice, at least for the present. I only regret one thing."</p>
               <p>"And that?"</p>
               <p>"Is that at the worst, the penalty for a libel is only a year's imprisonment in
                  the county penitentiary, and a fine. If we could only get him up to the States
                  Prison for a few years, we would then destroy his political rights, and be sure to
                  crush him. He <emph>might</emph> live through a year in the county prison—the
                  States prison would kill him."</p>
               <p>"You are right. You must strive to get some heavier crime fixed upon him if you
                  can. Remember oaths can be bought,—almost anything can be done with money."</p>
               <p>"I know it. I will think of some plan. By-the-way, is it not<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000131"/> possible to bring the new seduction law to bear
                  upon him?—that would have the double effect of destroying his domestic happiness,
                  and of sending him up.</p>
               <p>"You have touched upon a point where I have already commenced operations. Yet it
                  is a risky thing. I can find fifty girls whom I could get to swear as I directed;
                  but then woman's nature is fickle, they might betray us—and, moreover, it would be
                  impossible to get a pure girl to swear to a falsehood—therefore, I fear there is
                  danger in this. Still, leave that to me, I will try it, while <emph>you</emph> try
                  another course."</p>
               <p>"It is agreed, Eminence; and now if you'll order in a bottle of that old sherry, I
                  will drink your health. I feel dry—I have been very busy this morning."</p>

               <p>IN the back room of a groggery, in Park Row, two persons were seated. On a coarse
                  table, covered with a stained and tattered oilcloth, which looked as if it had
                  seen hard service, stood a pitcher of hot punch, from which the twain occasionally
                  replenished their glasses. One of these men was a tall, broad-shouldered, muscular
                  man, with rather coarse, well yet regulated features—a bright sharp eye, and a
                  voice, even low as he spoke, sounded like the deep rolling of distant thunder. His
                  dress was <emph>flashy</emph>—his appearance showy but not genteel. He displayed a
                  profusion of rich jewelry, and his garments, though very <emph>rich</emph>, were
                  ill-fitted. His age was probably forty.</p>
               <p>His companion was younger and much slimmer—in fact more genteel in his appearance,
                  though he had every mark of the B'hoy about him. I will introduce the first to the
                  reader as Mr. Grove; the second as Captain Hempere.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grove seemed laboring under a great state of excitement, which at each
                  successive glass of punch, seemed to get higher and higher, as if its steam
                  effected some of the unseen machinery of the brain.</p>
               <p>D—n it, Capt.," said he—"it'll never do to let this infernal Englishman come and
                  crow on my own ground."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact—but I don't see how we can stop him now?" replied the worthy
                  Captain.</p>
               <p>"Can't you hiss him down?"</p>
               <p>"I'd rather <emph>knock</emph> him down?" replied Hempere.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if he'd only stay knocked down, but that wouldn't do no good! He must not
                  play! What will stop him?"</p>
               <p>"Rocks, Mr. Grove; rocks!" said the Captain, emphatically.</p>
               <p>"Rocks?—you mean dollars?"</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6961-00000132"/>
               <p>"I don't mean anything else!" said the Captain, emptying his glass and refilling
                  it.</p>
               <p>"How many?"</p>
               <p>"That depends how many of the B'hoys I have to use. You know they won't work
                  without money."</p>
               <p>"Well—will a thousand cover the expenses?"</p>
               <p>"It may—and then again it mayn't! I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Grove, I'll act
                  for you on one condition. I don't want any money from you—that might tell bad on a
                  trial—but if a certain amount of money could be found in bank to my credit, I
                  might draw some of it occasionally, and apply it to useful purposes. But I must
                  not be connected with you in any way—nor must you appear in the matter. I can take
                  good care of myself and my boys—but I'd rather you'd fight your own craft,
                  yourself!"</p>
               <p>"Very well—call at the <emph>Sixth Ward Bank</emph> to-morrow and you will find a
                  bank book with your name in it, waiting for you."</p>
               <p>"Very good, sir—that's the way to talk. Do you know how one of our city fighting
                  clubs got its name?"</p>
               <p>"No! which do you mean?"<ref rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003"

               <p>"Ha! Ha! That's good—but I say Cap., this thing is settled,—understood,
                     <emph>eh?</emph>"</p>

               <p>"No—what do I want with him?"</p>
               <p>"Take my advice, put a hundred in his hand, give him a hint, and he'll do more to
                  get up a crowd than all of the rest of the editors in town. Pay him and he'll
                  write anything, even if it is a libel on himself."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact—I think your advice worth taking."</p>
               <p>"I think so, too. What I don't know about New York, isn't <emph>worth
                     knowing!</emph> Now, sir, I'll tip another tumbler and adjourn. There's going

               <p>THREE months have rolled by in my history, and I must draw several <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">tableaux,</foreign> or pictures, to paint the position of our
                  characters, and to show what has passed in the interim.</p>
               <p>First—one more view of that bed-chamber, in the mansion of his <emph>cursed</emph>
                  "Eminence," where poor Irene Montressor, the victim of his <emph>morality,</emph>
                  died like a Lucretia by her own hand. In that chamber see a young girl in tears—a
                  lovely girl. Her long black hair is loosely scattered over a fair neck and
                  drooping shoulders—hiding also her face from our view. Her rounded form is slight,
                  yet beautiful. Seated on a yielding ottoman, it sways to and fro, rocking as if
                  her soul was in agony. She seems not to heed the beautiful furniture—the
                  voluptuous paintings, the costly hangings of the room. The cooling dash of the
                  fountain in the alcove, falls listlessly on her ear. Who can she be? Ah—a step
                  beyond the door—a hand laid upon its lock—she raises her head. <emph>Is it
                     possible!</emph> Do we behold Lizzie Laurel? Her face is pale, yet the features
                  are the same—her eyes, glittering with tears, are larger, brighter than ever. But,
                     <emph>see!</emph> She shudders, and why? The door opens, and his Eminence
                  enters the room. Advancing with that everlasting, saintly smile on his cold
                  countenance, he says, in a tone low and sweet—</p>
               <p>"Why hast thou been weeping, child!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Eminence, I cannot do it. I cannot harm him."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, child! You say you love—I offer you a chance to marry him, and will you
                  refuse it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Eminence, the day was, when I would have laid down life itself, to have had
                  his lips pressed to mine, and heard him call me wife, but <emph>now</emph>—"</p>
               <p>She shuddered and did not conclude the sentence.</p>
               <p>"Well <emph>now,</emph> what mean you, child?"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, loving him as I do—loving him as I have loved him, <emph>dare</emph> I,
                     <emph>could</emph> I, even if he were divorced from his present wife, through
                  my false evidence, go to his arms the polluted, the dishonored thing you
                     <emph>know</emph> me to be."</p>
               <p>"Poh, child, it never will be known! Think you I have so little precaution, so
                  little discernment, as to permit my plans to rest on slight security?"</p>
               <p>"Eminence, you do not understand me! I could not deceive him—I <emph>love</emph>
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Poor fool!" said the priest, with a smile. "What fools you women are. Artful,
                  though you may be by study—heartless, through association and practice, when it
                  comes to the last, true test, nature will out, and you are <emph>woman,</emph>
                  heartful woman after all."</p>
               <p>Leaving that, we will change to another scene.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Ernest Cramer was seated by his wife. Though it was early in the evening, about
                  twilight, she was dressed in <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dishabille,</foreign> an
                  evidence that she cared more for personal comfort and for her husband's happiness
                  than <emph>very young</emph> married ladies are apt to. And yet company was
                  present. An effeminate, young-looking man was present, upon whose upper lip a very
                  scattered moustache grew, or was <emph>stuck on</emph>. His cheeks looked as if
                  they were indebted to Gouraud for their color—his lips looked <emph>salvy,</emph>
                  though his head did not appear to have much of the <hi rend="i"/>sabe in it. The
                  dress of this individual was foppish, and in fact he bore the full semblance of
                  one of those apish things, known as a Broadway dandy—creatures which come out,
                  like butterflies, on a sunny afternoon—staring with their weak eyes, through
                  quizzing-glasses, at the beauty on the pave, as bats look down through even's
                  twilight on a garden of flowers. I never think of these <emph>things,</emph>
                  without my lip curling in scorn, and my heart shrinking with disgust. A woman of
                  soul and mind and feeling, could no more <emph>love</emph> such a class of male
                  individuals (I cannot call them <emph>men,</emph>) than she could love a race of
                  sick baboons. A woman, that <emph>is</emph> a woman, I care not what be her
                  station in life, loves a <emph>man!</emph> Foppishness—the mere accomplishments of
                  the drawing-room, will not win her love or esteem<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000134"/> Chivalry, honor, truth, and candor, even though
                  they are almost <emph>blunt,</emph> will please far better than the soft-sayings,
                  the insulting flattery, the unmeaning compliments of one of the
                     <emph>things</emph> I have alluded to <emph>Isn't it so, dear ladies?</emph>
                  There, I thought you'd answer <emph>yes,</emph> just as quick and as natural, as
                  if some favored lover had asked you to bless him with your hand.</p>
               <p>Ernest though seated by the side of her he loved, seemed fretful and uneasy. Time
                  after time he glanced at his watch, and rising, paced the apartment.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Cramer?" asked the lady. "You seem <emph>very</emph>
                  nervous."</p>
               <p>"How can I help it, dear Serena. You know I am engaged this night to address my
                  brothers of the Order in New Brunswick—that at this moment they are waiting for
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Have you not telegraphed to them that I was sick, and you could not come?'</p>
               <p>"Yes, Serena, but still I cannot feel satisfied. Though the <emph>event</emph> we
                  expect may occur to-night, yet were it not—were you not really sick enough to
                  excuse the neglect, I should forever feel ashamed for having disappointed
                  them."</p>
               <p>"Poh!" cried the lady, her beautiful lip curling in disdain, "you think a great
                  deal of a set of common mechanics, when you can hesitate between their wishes and
                  mine—don't you think he does, Mr. Plantagenet?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, demme, yes'm!" said the individual appealed to.</p>
               <p>"Serena!" said Cramer, calmly, "you know that you <emph>pain</emph> me, when you
                  allude slightingly to the workingmen of America. I have been, ever will be devoted
                  to them, for such as they, won our freedom—such as they, must preserve it."</p>
               <p>"Preserve it! just as if it was in <emph>danger!</emph> That's a good joke, isn't
                  it, Mr. Plantagenet?"</p>
               <p>"Demmed foine, on honor, mem—<emph>dem'd</emph> foine!"</p>
               <p>Cramer paid little heed to the conversation, walking to and fro in the room,
                  evidently "out o' sorts," but at last, taking out a pocketbook, pretty well filled
                  with papers, he remarked:</p>
               <p>"You'll have to excuse me, Serena; I forgot a little piece of business. I received
                  a notice to-day from Binghampton, which I must refer to Mr. Graham, my legal
                  adviser. It will not take me long to see him."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. C.; but do not be long absent, I feel nervous. Maybe Mr.
                  Plantagenet will go along?"</p>
               <p>"Yes'm! Oh, yes'm, I loike a promenade in the evening. Its refreshing—dem'd
                  foine!"</p>
               <p>Cramer did not seem to heed this offer of an escort, but putting on an overcoat
                  and taking a cane in his hand, as usual, he kissed his wife's fair brow and left
                  the room, accompanied (without requesting it) by the individual whom Mrs. C.
                  called Plantagenet.</p>
               <p>And here we will let this picture, or tableaux, end.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Next we will refer to a scene which occurred several hours previous to that which
                  was last described.</p>
               <p>It occurred in the counting-room of a wealthy merchant in the city. There were
                  three persons present, who belonged to the class known to the world as the "upper
                  ten," named by one Bennett, the "codfish aristocracy," known to me,
                     <emph>only,</emph> as the <emph>snobocracy</emph>. Three of this class were
                  there, and before them stood one of the "b'hoys of New York."</p>
               <p>"How many men can you take there?" asked one of the merchants.</p>
               <p>"Fifty, or sixty, o' the right stripe!"</p>
               <p>"And they'll hurrah for McReady, and <emph>fight,</emph> if anybody tries to
                  interrupt him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, provided they're <emph>paid!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"They shall be; but you'll want tickets to go in with?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and 'blunt' to treat'm with. The boys'll be <emph>dry</emph> till they get
                  in a <emph>load!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then here's a hundred dollars in fives," said the first speaker; "use it with
                  discretion; there's a budget of tickets, too, a hundred or more; use both
                  properly."</p>
               <p>"D—n me if I don't!' muttered the b'hoy, as he went out.</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6961-00000135"/>
               <p>This ends the third tableaux—we will try a fourth scene</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The day had opened with a grey mantle of drizzly cloud between the earth and the
                  sun. All the day long the atmosphere seemed heavy and stifling, as if ominous of
                  some impending evil. About the corners in the lower part of the town, groups of
                  people could be seen conversing in an excited manner. Around and in the grog shops
                  of Park Row and Centre street, large crowds of the b'hoys were scattered, "going
                  in" to the bad liquor which is plenty there, with a carelessness that betokened
                  that money was unusually plenty with them.</p>
               <p>Along the streets, at every corner, and on every post were posted large bills with
                  singular headings, which induced every passer-by to stop and read them. On one
                  these, words were printed in large letters: "Englishmen, will you permit your
                  countryman to be insulted!" On another: "Americans, support your own son; down
                  with the English hounds!"</p>
               <p>Strange bills, strange notices were these, yet the money of one party paid for
                     <emph>both</emph>—the same printer printed both, the same men had both posted
                  around the city, and yet those men were never punished, scarcely questioned.<ref

               <p>But to the scene. As night approached the crowds at the corners became more dense.
                  Some topic of universal interest seemed to have arisen. At the Mayor's office, in
                  the Park, several of the wealthy up-town citizens, were holding a caucus, and
                  among them was a leader of the b'hoys, quiet, saying but little, but listening to
                  all they said. They were urging upon the weak and timid Mayor that he must call
                  out troops, to support an actor, whom they supposed obnoxious to the people, the
                     <emph>common, vulgar people!</emph> Troops, in a city guarded by 900 policemen,
                  with but a few exceptions, inhabited by as orderly a people as ever lived on the
                  face of the earth!</p>
               <p>At this crisis, and the best act that the man ever did, the leader of the b'hoys
                  before alluded to, spoke up, begging his "HONOR" (?) to give an order that the
                  theatre should not be opened. "Ther'll be a row if it is!" said he; "and I hope
                  your honor 'll consider that human life is worth more than money, or even the
                  satisfaction that these <emph>gentlemen</emph> of the upper-ten will have in
                  saying that they, at the price of bloodshed, have sustained themselves above the
                  will of the people.</p>
               <p>It may seem strange to the reader, that this man, already sold to two parties,
                  should so plead for a cessation of the play, and thus, at <emph>that</emph> hour,
                  try to stop the impending danger. But the idea vanishes, when we remember that at
                  this hour he and his gang had got all the <emph>money</emph> they could expect
                  from either side, and had nothing more to expect than hard knocks, or cold lead,
                  which they are always ready to avoid, without it <emph>pays</emph>. His appeal,
                  therefore, was not from a really good motive, but because <emph>he</emph> and
                     <emph>his</emph> could make no more, if a riot did occur.</p>
               <p>Again he used a false argument, when he said that it was the will of the people
                  that McReady should not play. The "people," at large, cared no more about either
                  actors, than they did about Miller, the Millenium humbug—not half as much as they
                  did about Barnum's next "novelty." I repeat here, that the Astor Place Riot was
                  gotten up by the card-signing aristocrats, by Bennett of the Herald, through his
                  articles on the subject, and by a few hired rowdies, who could be hired just as
                  readily to burn and sack a church, and who could do but one thing <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">gratis</foreign> if they had a chance, or dared, and that would
                  be to rid themselves of a foe who, since he first raised a pen in this city, to
                  this hour, has been, and will be, their uncompromising enemy.</p>
               <p>But time sped on. Soon twilight began to deepen, and men in military uniforms were
                  seen hurrying toward the Arsenal yard. Sober old citizens looked upon these things
                  with surprise, the younger ones with curiosity, wishing to know what it meant. Up
                  Broadway, not knowing for what they were going, yet filled with a strange
                  curiosity, wishing to know what was coming off, went thousands of people—calm at
                  heart, no animosity in their bosoms, no excitement.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6961-00000136"/>
               <p>And where had Ernest Cramer been all this day? With the exception of a brief visit
                  to his office, all that long day had he been seated by the side of his wife,
                  busily writing, little dreaming of the storm that was lowering over the peace of
                  the city. There, until he left the house with young Plantagenet, he had remained,
                  little thinking that the various plots for his ruin, which, with a man's energy he
                  had combatted, were now centering in one, more dangerous than all. But to the next
                  picture.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Earnest, in company with Plantagenet, yet not seeming much to heed the fellow's
                  presence, passed from his door, and took the street which led to his lawyer's
                  residence. Twilight had now deepened into the shadows of night, and a neighboring
                  church clock told the half hour past seven. The lamps loomed up through the hazy
                  mist, casting but little light forth, yet looking twice as large as usual. The
                  pavements were damp and sloppy—the air chill and cold for the spring time. Yet
                  many people were abroad, all moving silently along toward one direction—all calm,
                  and no one appearing to know his neighbor's destination or business.</p>
               <p>"I wondaw where all these common folks are a going, aw?" muttered Plantagenet.</p>
               <p>"Is there not some public meeting?" suggested Cramer.</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of. I read the 'Erald and the Hexpress, but I saw—ah, I remember
                  the 'Erald said there might be a wumpus at the Hastor Place Hopera 'Ouse, demme! I
                  think that's what the fools are going to see."</p>
               <p>"True!" said Cramer, "I had forgotten it—yet there is too <unclear>much</unclear>
                  good sense in the community, I hope, to permit it to join in the private quarrels
                  of two play actors!"</p>
               <p>"Aw! demme, yes!" and the dandy, having exhausted himself by this sensible reply,
                  walked on in silence.</p>
               <p>They soon arrived at the house where Mr. G. resided, but here Cramer was doomed to
                  a disappointment. He had gone up to the Opera House, said the servant.</p>
               <p>"I must see him to-night!" muttered Cramer; "it is important that he sees this
                  notice—it has only seven days' time left. I'll go up to the Theatre."</p>
               <p>"Aw, yes!" and Mr. Plantaganet went along with Cramer.</p>
               <p>They proceeded up to Broadway, where the throng became thicker and thicker, all
                  moving toward one point—all quiet, and apparently wondering what was on the
                  tapis—yet all moving together. Soon Cramer and his companion reached a point
                  opposite the large building, known as the Opera House. Here an immense crowd were
                  standing, all looking in quiet wonder toward the building, which was as usual,
                  brilliantly lighted up. In closer toward the theatre, carriages and omnibuses were
                  setting down their loads of company, while a few of that class of vagabond boys,
                  who on Sundays loaf around the rum-shops and wharves, and who have often brought
                  injurious reports on our noble firemen, by their habits of "running with the
                  engines," where shouting and yelling at them. Policemen were scattered about,
                  mostly to be known by their clubs, for they had their <emph>"stars"
                     hidden</emph>.<ref rend="super" target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>At this hour, in the whole mass, and all around the Theatre, everything was quiet,
                  except the hooting of small parties of these rowdy boys, who yelled, they knew not
                  at what, or why. But at this moment an omnibus filled with young men, whose dress,
                  close cut hair, and unmistakable language, at once proclaimed them to be members
                  of one of the fighting clubs of the city drove up to the doors. They had tickets
                  for admittance, and were received at the doors of that theatre just as kindly as
                  if they had worn kid gloves and carried gold-headed canes in their hands.
                     <emph>Why</emph> was this? Let those "Card-signing Aristocrats" reply—let them
                  reply over the graves of the victims of their folly.</p>
               <p>Soon after these rowdies were admitted, hideous noises, shouts, groans, and yells
                  were heard to come from the interior of the theatre, by those who were outside.
                  Then a commotion began outside. Men who <emph>had</emph> tickets tried to gain an
                  entrance, and were denied. Excited by the shouts, and full of the fun of
                  destructiveness, the boys first alluded<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6961-00000137"/>
                  luded to returned yell for yell; and some, bolder than the rest, began to cast
                  stones at the windows of the building, shattering here and there a pane of glass.
                  At this moment, a large body of the police were called to protect the dwelling of
                  a female millionaire, though no one ever dreamed of an attack upon it. Yet there
                  was wine in its cellars—food in its lockers, and our brave police deemed it their
                     <emph>duty</emph> to protect these necessary articles. The house was close at
                  hand—they would be near the scene of action.</p>
               <p>It was at this moment that Ernest Cramer, accompanied by the handsome Plantagenet,
                  reached the upper side of Eighth street, nearly opposite the theatre. Here he
                  paused on the side-walk, and gazed toward the building, as did thousands of
                  others, wondering what was to occur, or why so large a crowd were assembled.
                  Closer in by the building, a few rowdy boys were shouting and yelling—occasionally
                  a stone or two was thrown, and then a rush would be made by some of the police for
                  the offenders, who, laughing and yelling, would run away. While Cramer stood
                  there, a man came and impertinently stared him in the face; but as he immediately
                  afterwards disappeared in the crowd, Cramer thought no more of the circumstance.
                  Plantagenet, whose frilled shirt began to suffer from the pressure of so many
                  beings, declared the crowd "dem'd annoying," and backed out. Cramer, who had no
                  further desire to stay, followed him; but before he had taken ten steps toward
                  Broadway, he found himself suddenly seized by four or five stalwart men, who
                  shouted in a tone that told that they were "natives" of some other soil than this:
                  "Here he is, sure! In wid the bast—in wid him!"</p>
               <p>Before he could reply or offer resistance, he was half-shoved, half-carried across
                  the street, gaining free admittance into the theatre very much against his desire.
                  Here a scene opened to his view which would out-rival Pandemonium. He was carried
                  into a lower lobby of the building, where were already confined some dozens of the
                  rowdies who had been hired to support the actor, but who really turned out to be
                  rioters. Mad with drunkenness and rage—their clothes half-torn off, many of them
                  bruised and bloody, venting forth horrible curses and imprecations they seemed
                  more like fiends let loose from hell, than human beings. Seeing Cramer brought in,
                  they yelled with a mad glee, and shouted to the officers to give him over to them,
                  some of them swearing they would tear him limb from limb. <emph>They</emph> did
                  not recognise <emph>him</emph> as a rioter; but they <emph>did</emph> recognise
                  him as a denouncer and hater of all the rowdies and villains in the city—one who
                  had held them up to the public indignation, and demanded of the authorities their
                  dissolution. And so violent were the <emph>rioters</emph> against this lone man,
                  that the police were forced in very shame to protect him.</p>
               <p>It was yet early. All this had occurred before or by eight o'clock. But now the
                  noise outside the theatre grew louder and louder. Soon a man was brought in
                  severely wounded. When asked how it was done, a policeman explained that a troop
                  of Dutch horsemen had been ordered to ride through the crowd, and this man had
                  been struck down by a cavalry sword. Ever and anon, the brave police, four or five
                  at a time, would rush in with a fresh prisoner, some young boy, who, through the
                  influence of bad company, or curiosity, had come within their reach.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, a fearful cry was heard, a fearful cry, when heard in a house crowded
                  with human beings—Fire! <emph>fire!!</emph> FIRE!!! A thick and stifling cloud of
                  smoke bursts from a lower room; but in a moment its source is discovered, and it
                  is stamped out, without even the use of water.</p>
               <p>Still louder now is heard the uproar inside and outside the theatre—the noise
                  quite as great within as without. A portion of the people, maddened by being
                  ridden over by the Dutch cavalry when standing quietly in the street, and being
                  knocked down by policemen when from the outside pressure they have no chance of
                  retreat, have dared to resist—have dared to defend themselves! The police now
                  retreat within the theatre, or to the houses of the millionaires of Astor Place.
                  The Governor of the State, and the Mayor of the city, perched like
                     <emph>cowards</emph> in the upper story of a hotel, instead of doing their duty
                  on the scene of action, and interposing their high authority to quell violence,
                  send for the military—not for a force which in numbers would, by their weight,
                  clear the ground, but for two small<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6961-00000138"/>
                  companies, bidding them come with fixed bayonets and loaded muskets—and this, too,
                  in a city guarded by nine hundred policemen—in a land of freedom, and not of armed
                  and iron-heeled despotism! Soon they come, a small band of brave and well-trained
                  men—sworn upon the holy Bible to support the laws, and support their officers,
                  obeying their orders. Who will blame <emph>them</emph> for appearing there? Who
                  will blame them for the dreadful consequences which followed? No just man! They
                  did only as they were ordered.</p>
               <p>The military came. They were ordered to march through and clear the street, now so
                  densely crowded that men could neither get out of the crowd, or force it back.
                  With charged bayonets they try to force their way through. Men feel the points of
                  cold steel, and shriek that they cannot fall back—people from the outside are so
                  continually pushing in to see what is going on. And then many a one—some of them
                  soon were cold in death—wished that curiosity had not led them there. And now the
                  police, emboldened by the presence of an armed force, again showed themselves, and
                  began to beat back those who would gladly have retreated if they could. And
                     <emph>then</emph>, and not <emph>till</emph> then, did the riot really
                  commence. Then men, maddened by pricking bayonets, and by blows which were
                  showered upon them, and which they could not retreat from, tore up stones from the
                  pavement, and dashed them into the faces of the soldiers and the police. It was in
                  vain, then, that the Recorder, a brave, noble and honorable man, begged the crowd
                  to disperse. Had they the disposition, unless the outside masses had first fallen
                  back, those next to the soldiers could not! And the outside masses were too far
                  away to hear his voice. The people now aroused to anger, forced in upon bayonets
                  and clubs, attempted to drive the soldiers back. Then, <emph>and be it remembered,
                     in self-defence</emph>, the soldiers fired. Some with commendable, but mistaken
                  humanity, fired over the heads of the people—mistaken humanity, I say, for people
                  were killed four and five hundred yards distant, who were as innocent as unborn
                  babes of even a connection with the crowd. One, a woman, was shot in a railroad
                  car, beyond the crowd. Others were killed who were struggling to get clear of the
                  crowd; and never yet has it been proved that one active opposer of the troops or
                  police was shot. Three times did those death-dealing tubes pour out their leaden
                  messengers of fate in that crowd; and then, when people on the outer edge beheld
                  dead men carried past them, and then only, did they begin to understand that there
                  was a riot, and it was necessary for them to disperse. Then, as they fell back,
                  those who had been <emph>forced</emph> by imprudence on the part of the
                  authorities to become rioters, had room to fall back, and to retire, sad and
                  indignant, to their homes. Then did the kid-gloved aristocrats who had brought all
                  this evil about, retire to their palaces, rejoicing that they had carried their
                  point—that McReady had played. Little cared they for the groans of the dying;
                  little heeded they the moans of the widowed and orphaned ones, whose husbands and
                  fathers had that night been sacrificed to their pride. Oh God! have those people
                  consciences, and can they <emph>think?</emph> If so, let their curse be to
                     <emph>think</emph> forevermore!</p>
               <p>Where was Ernest Cramer all this time? Confined in a lower part of the theatre. In
                  vain did he represent that he was not a rioter, but a supporter of the laws, in
                  all cases. In vain did he demand his release. The "Greeks," the "authorities"
                  which he had so often condemned for selling and prostituting justice, and last,
                  but not least, the Jesuits, whose own servants had arrested him, had got a hold
                  upon him, had got a charge fixed, and he was from that hour <q>

                  been reading, "you will sway the opinion of the outsiders; our own organ, with the
                  powerful pen of McVampyre, will fix his fate in Catholic minds; Manton and Arnold

                  while it breaks his heart, will be the final blow to damn his reputation. We have
                  our foe in our hands—he cannot escape us now."</p>
               <p>"No, dom him, no!" said the Scotchman.</p>
               <p>"And now I almost feel inclined to pity the fellow!" said Manton. "If I did not
                  believe that I shall secure that magnificent wife of his for myself, I should
                  almost feel like relenting. Gambler though I am, I <emph>can</emph> feel a regret
                  to see a brave man snared by such a set of d—d rascals as we are."</p>
               <p>"You are complimentary, sir!" said the priest, severely.</p>
               <p>"Truth don't always study the effect of her compliments!" replied the gambler. "I,
                  sir, can win a man's money and smile while I ruin him. I can shoot an enemy down
                  in fair fight, or if I think him dangerous, stab him in the back—but when at one
                  fell swoop we rob a man of everything that makes life worth having, knowing too,
                  that we rob him through falsehood and treachery—it seems almost as if it was going
                  a shade too far. I have suffered in my feelings as much, and in my pocket
                     <emph>more</emph>, than any of you have. He has held my name up to scorn and
                  contumely; called me a common robber. He has drawn victim after victim from my
                  grasp, even when their fortunes seemed in my power. He has stirred up the very
                  devil in my camp—but yet I feel, now, that we are running him a little too
                  hard."</p>
               <p>"A splendid sermon! Can't I get you to preach for me, after mass, next Sunday,
                  sir!" said the priest, mockingly.</p>
               <p>"Aye do, an' I'll send one o' ma splendeed corps of reporters to tak' it doon!"
                  said Gordon.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what has come over you, Manton!" said Arnold with a sneer. "It is not
                  your usual way to forgive one who has injured you—nor your custom to let a man up
                  till you have stripped him. Remember, sir, you are pledged to <emph>others</emph>
                  of the profession, to carry this matter out, and that a large amount of money has
                  been contributed by them for the purpose, which we hold."</p>
               <p>"That's true!" said the gambler. "It was only a momentary weakness that came over
                  me—a kind of feeling that I often felt before I became what I am! Go on,
                  gentlemen; I'll be foremost with you now."</p>
               <p>"So will I, dom it, so long as it pays!" said the Scotchman. "And now I'll go to
                  ma offeece, and write another arteekle for tomorrow's paper, hitting him again,
                  and just hinting a wee bit at a deevorce in embryo. I'll touch him, or get "At."
                  to do it. It takes heem to do the bitter!"</p>
               <p>The favorite servant of his Eminence came in at this moment, and
                     <unclear>handed</unclear> the latter a note. The priest opened it, and with a
                  smile, said:</p>
               <p>"The thing works well. I've a note here from the Magistrate. The fellow has done
                  exactly as I wished—he has given bail. Had he demanded an instant examination, our

                  we will have time to fix and secure his indictment by a Grand Jury, and plenty of
                  time to secure proper witnesses, and influence the public mind so as to ensure his
                  conviction. And Gordon, by the way, in regard to that libel suit<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000140"/> I would advise you not to pursue it legally, but
                  keep threatening annoying and complaining, and work on the popular feeling against
                  him on that point. He might, if tried on that, prove his own innocence, and the
                  guilt of our tool, as also certain other <emph>imprudences,</emph> which would
                  change the tide of public opinion in his favor, and lessen our chances on this
                  point."</p>

               <p>"The plan of His Eminence is good!" said Arnold, after a moment's study.</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen, I see no further use of continuing this conference. Take a glass
                  of wine with me, and then excuse my further attendance. I have other business to

               <p>When Earnest Cramer was arrested, the mostachioed dandy was already some hundred
                  yards ahead, going down Broadway at as rapid a rate as his feeble limbs would
                  carry him. In a short time he reached the residence of Cramer. Rushing into the
                  parlor, with a few drops of sweat oozing out from his painted face, like rosin
                  melting from the barked side of a Southern pine, he threw himself upon a sofa, and
                  fanning himself with his hat, cried:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Aw! Demme!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Plantagenet?—you alarm me!" cried Mrs. Cramer. "Where is
                  Ernest?"</p>

               <p>"And Ernest?"</p>
               <p>"Is there, demme!"</p>

               <p>"One, two, three long and weary hours passed before Ernest Cramer arrived at his
                  home. The dandy had long before left for "that repose which ever awaits innocence
                  and beauty." I quote from an ancient poet.</p>
               <p>One, two, three hours did the wife await the return of her husband, but he came at
                  last. It was midnight. He was pale and nervous. She noticed it.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Ernest?" she asked. "You have been in trouble."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear Serena, yes! I have been arrested as a rioter."</p>
               <p>"As a <emph>rioter!</emph> Has your Americanism carried you so far as that, sir?"
                  said the wife coldly.</p>
               <p>"Carried me so far, Serena! You surely do not think that I have been guilty of
                  joining in the mob?"</p>
               <p>"Why then were you arrested, sir?"</p>
               <p>"By some of those hounds whom I have offended by my free expressions was I
                  arrested, madam; not because I have been a rioter. But I only came home to allay
                  your fears; I thought you would be anxious, as I never before have staid out so
                  late since our marriage. I must return to the station-house; I am now out on my
                  parole of honor, to return within an hour. I must stay there till morning, and
                  then I will give bail. The charge of riot is false and cannot be sustained for an
                  instant. I have, in all of my articles upon the subject, sided with your
                  countrymen on this matter."</p>
               <p>"So you have, Ernest; forgive me for an unjust suspicion; you know not how
                     <emph>they</emph> are trying to set me against you; forgive me, for I
                     <emph>love</emph> you, and they shall not make me hate you."</p>

                  Fear not, they shall not change me."</p>
               <p>"God grant they may not, Serena. That would be the only thing that could
                     <emph>crush</emph> me. All other oppressions and wrongs I can bear; but when
                  you—you, the mother of the child which soon will open its eyes to Heaven's
                  sunlight, desert me, <emph>then</emph> shall I <emph>die!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Fear it not, my husband. They tell me strange stories, but I cannot and will not
                  believe them."</p>
               <p>"Serena!" said that husband, solemnly; "Serena, I have every reason to believe
                  that a deep and cunningly laid plot is at work to ruin our peace and to separate
                  us. You know that I have never uttered an unkind word to you."</p>
               <p>"You have not, dear husband."</p>
               <p>"Then promise me, come what may, never to decide against me, on any charge, until
                  you have heard my defence and given me a chance to confront my accusers. Serena,
                  as God hears me, I solemnly swear that I <emph>have been</emph> and
                     <emph>will</emph> be true to you; I am impulsive, too confiding, too open,
                  perhaps; but I can never be <emph>guilty</emph>. You <emph>know</emph> that I
                  never <emph>lie</emph>—I will not break my vows."</p>
               <p>It seemed as if affections which day by day had been growing colder and colder,
                  rushed back like an ebb tide turning flood, into that young wife's heart. With a
                  burst of passionate tears, she threw herself upon his throbbing breast, and amidst
                  kisses, and broken sobs, murmured out words of affection warmer than ever before
                  came from her lips. For minutes she lay thus upon his bosom, and he with tender
                  looks and fond replies, pressed her closer and closer to his heart. <emph>Oh, that
                     was a happy</emph> HOUR! <emph>Serena, is it forgotten?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Time flew rapidly on. The husband glanced at his watch, and said sadly:</p>
               <p>"Serena, my hour is nearly up; I must return to the station-house—remember, my
                  parole is given. Though <emph>free,</emph> I am still a
                  <emph>prisoner</emph>."</p>
               <p>"A prisoner? Oh, say not so, dear husband. You must not go back amongst that vile
                  rabble."</p>
               <p>"I must, my sweet one. I never <emph>lie!</emph> My word was given to return.'</p>
               <p>"Then let me go with you. It will soon be daylight. I shall not mind it with you
                  by my side."</p>
               <p>"What! dear Serena! expose you to the lawless gaze of the vile hounds in that
                  building—expose you to the foul atmosphere of the prison? Never! never. Sooner
                  would I rot there alone, than let you breathe for one hour its chill and tainted
                  air. Bear up, love Be a <emph>woman</emph>, and ere nine o'clock in the morning, I
                  will be again by your side. I shall send for bail immediately after daylight."</p>
               <p>With fond kisses and kind words, they separated—he to go to the station-house, she
                  to retire to her bed for the <emph>first time since their marriage,
                  alone</emph>.</p>

               <p>And now for another picture. Like a panorama, now moves the conspiracy along. Now,
                  as it draws towards a point, each character stands vividly out, and plays its part
                  in the drama. Now can the guiding and master-hand of the whole be seen—now can the
                  reader see how terrible a power can be brought to bear upon an innocent man, when
                  wealth and Jesuitical hate and strength, linked with vice, move on in secrecy and
                  might to crush him. Who can withstand it? No mortal man or woman, unless the
                  merciful hand of Almighty God is stretched out to support and save them.</p>
               <p>It was three months later still. Beside his Eminence, in his favorite chamber, two
                  females were seated. One was Gulietta, alias the widow Montrose. The other was
                  Lizzie Laurel, but how altered. A brazen look of self-confidence occupied the look
                  of purity and innocence which she once wore—her ruin was complete—for shame had
                  fled from her heart forever. Oh, what a very <emph>fiend</emph> a woman can be,
                  who is lost to shame. As woman is unapproachably lofty, aye, even holy in her
                  purity, so is she when fallen, inconceivably low and depraved. With her there is
                  no medium—she <emph>must</emph> be an angel, or a devil.</p>
               <p>Forgive me, if I wrong the sex, but a keen observance of human nature has taught
                  me this. I have seen woman in the palace, and in<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6961-00000142"/> the prison—have seen her in the humble cot of
                  virtuous poverty, and in the tinselled dens of iniquity. I have wept over her
                  wrongs, and battled for her rights. I have <emph>loved</emph>, God in Heaven only
                  knows, how purely, how devotedly, how madly I have <emph>loved</emph> woman. Yet
                  never have I <emph>hated</emph> her, though from woman came the harshest blow that
                  ever fell upon my strained and sorrowing heart. Then have not I a right to express
                  a knowledge of their nature?</p>
               <p>But to my story. A sarcastic smile was resting on the face of his Eminence, as he
                  addressed Lizzie Laurel.</p>
               <p>"So, my little beauty, you failed in your attempt upon his heart and virtue, and
                  he scornfully refused your advances."</p>
               <p>"Yes!" she replied, and her voice once so low and sweet, was husky with passion.
                  "Yes, but Ernest Cramer shall rue the day when he bade me leave him, and drew back
                  in haughty pride from me as a lost and degraded thing. I may be lost, but I am too
                  good for him."</p>
               <p>"So you are, my dear!" chimed in Mrs. Montrose. "Beauty like yours would win a
                  hermit from his cell, and will yet draw the homage of the most wealthy, talented
                  and beautiful of our land to your feet. If he had so scorned <emph>me</emph>, I
                  would <emph>hate</emph> him, <emph>oh</emph>, how I <emph>would</emph> hate
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> hate him!" muttered the girl between her closed teeth. "I could
                  tear his icy heart from out his bosom and eat it."</p>
               <p>The smile on the priest's face grew brighter and yet more devilish, as he marked
                  the passion in the young girl's soul. He saw that she was now ripe for his
                  designs—that now she would be a willing tool for his revenge.</p>
               <p>"You say you hate him, child—prove it!" he said.</p>
               <p>"How? <emph>show</emph> me how."</p>
               <p>"Be revenged at once upon him, and her he loves; tear them apart: break their
                  hearts—ha! ha! what a glorious revenge that would be."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes"—she hissed between her pale lips; "Yes, I will do it—I will do it; only
                  teach me how."</p>
               <p>"You must go to her and tell her that he seduced you. Go to the wife of his bosom
                  and tell her, that while he was vowing love and constancy to <emph>her</emph>, he
                  was drawing you to ruin and to infamy in his arms. Take Mrs. Montrose with you for
                  proof; she will corroborate all you say; but tell her all this in
                     <emph>confidence</emph>—let him not be brought to confront you, or you will
                  fail. But, with well feigned tears, attest your ruin; appeal to her for right. If
                  yet she doubts, fly to her relations and tell them the same tale; offer proof, and
                  I will see that you have the proof. Do this well, and I will secure to you a
                  fortune for life, and a husband, if you want one."</p>
               <p>"I will! I will!" she muttered in the same fierce, low, firm tone.</p>
               <p>"Do it, and I will see that oath upon oath shall be ready to attest to all you
                  utter. But be careful to so bind them to secrecy, that all will break upon him at
                  the same hour when the trial for riot comes off. He must receive a blow from every
                  point at once, and he must fall. Gulietta—how stands Hilton; is he yet in the web
                  of your charms?"</p>
               <p>"He loves <emph>me</emph>, Eminence, and I have made him hate Cramer."</p>
               <p>"It is well! <emph>All</emph> is well. He cannot escape; in vain now may he launch
                  forth his anathemas at the Holy Church, and our sect. Soon he will be scorned by
                  all; his name be a bye-word of disgrace; his power wasted; his heart broken; he an
                  outcast from the world. Ha! ha! a glorious plot and nobly carried out."</p>
               <p>The priest laughed till his face became scarlet. His eyes seemed to gloat upon the
                  sight of a writhing victim. He rubbed his white hands together as if he could not
                  restrain a single sign of glee.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" he cried; "he shall be a CONVICT—a DIVORCE—an <emph>outcast</emph>—from the
                  hearts of all mankind. Then, and not till then, will the strong arm and fearless
                  tongue which has upheld and preached Native Americanism, be palsied and helpless.
                  Then and not till then, will a blight and a shadow come upon those whom he has
                  converted and who have supported him. When they despise him they will forget his
                  teachings, and the most dangerous foes to the advancement of our sect will be cast
                  down. Glorious plot; happy consummation.</p>

               <p>Another picture yet. Ernest Cramer stood in his wife's chamber, pale, sad, and
                  thoughtful. His young wife pacing to and fro in the room, bearing in her arms an
                  infant, which, even young as it was, bore his features. His eye of blue was
                  duplicated in its own—his brow, square and massive, was seen in its forehead. And,
                  young as it was, it laughed and held out its arms.</p>
               <p>"Serena!" said he, "my trial is to come off to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I am aware of it, sir!" she said, coldly, "and it is not the <emph>only</emph>
                  trial you have to meet."</p>
               <p>"My God, Serena, what is the matter? What <emph>can</emph> have changed you
                  so!"</p>
               <p>"Wrongs, sir—your wrongs!"</p>
               <p>"My wrongs? Serena, as God hears me, never have I wronged you in word, thought, or
                  deed."</p>
               <p>"Do not add perjury, sir, to infamy. I have proof for all that I utter."</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Proof—proof</emph>, did you say, Serena!—Then if you have it,
                     <emph>produce</emph> it—let me meet my accusers. Remember your promise."</p>
               <p>"You shall have proof and a chance when your trial comes on—until then, sir, I do
                  not wish to see your face."</p>
               <p>"Serena, for our child's sake, hear me"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, go—go to your trial."</p>
               <p>"Serena, on my bended knees—knees which never before were bent to a mortal, I pray
                  you to hear me."</p>
               <p>"Leave me, sir! I will meet you at your trial—leave me, ere I <emph>hate</emph>
                  you more than I do."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Hate</emph> me, Serena! Hate <emph>me?</emph> Oh my God, has it come to
                  this!"</p>
               <p>Man though he was—Ernest Cramer burst into tears and left the room—yet, as he left
                  it, he turned one look towards his child. It held out its little arms to him as if
                  to call him back. He never saw it more.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <p>A WEEK more has passed, and a week nearer to eternity, and to his doom, was the
                  victim. Our next picture is a hall of JUSTICE, as it is falsely called, in New
                  York, or, in other terms, a Court-room. On the bench three persons were seated.
                  The centre individual was a tall, rather good-looking man, so far as his figure
                  was concerned; but he was low-browed, and had a look which betokened natural
                  vulgarity, which even education and an association with refined society could not
                  entirely overcome. His countenance wore an expression of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >hauteur</foreign> which at once told an observer, that where he had
                     <emph>power</emph>, he would be a tyrant. His features were of that cast which
                  at once showed his Irish birth. There is something in an Irishman which always
                  distinguishes his land of nativity—you never can mistake him. In an American,
                  Englishman, Dutchman or Frenchman there are peculiarities; but for all you may be
                  mistaken in judging by sight of their nationality. Not so with the Irishman—you
                  never will mistake him for anything but a Patlander. On the left of the first
                  judge sat an assistant, or associate, who was also an Irishman, as could be seen
                  by his looks. On the right sat a stupid, heavy-looking man, who had neither, in
                  feature or manner, sufficient expression to give any one an idea either of his
                  nationality or profession. This party composed the Court.</p>
               <p>Before the judges, were seated three lawyers, who filled the position of public
                  prosecutors. The hook nose, keen black eyes, coarse black hair, swarthy complexion
                  and high cheek bones of <emph>one</emph>, betokened him to be a Jew. The sharp,
                  Irish features, pale complexion, and sanctified look of another would have led me
                  to imagine that he was a <emph>Jesuit</emph>. Perhaps the imagination in such a
                  case would be nearer <emph>truth</emph> than it is in some cases. The third was a
                     sallow-faced<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6961-00000144"/>
                  crab-apple-tree-featured man, who looked as if he would delight in seeing every
                  thing, and every man on earth, writhing in misery.</p>
               <p>The Court room was crowded. The hour for the trial had arrived. Ernest Cramer
                  entered the room and seated himself near the bar. A friend joined him:</p>
               <p>"Who is your lawyer?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"I have none," replied Cramer.</p>
               <p>"My God! you are not going to risk a trial like this without a lawyer?"</p>
               <p>I <emph>am</emph>, and for two reasons. In the first place, I am innocent; in the
                  second, innocent or guilty, I am already tried, convicted and sentenced. I have no
                  chance of an acquittal. See Judge Weekly on the bench—he is my <emph>bitter,
                     personal enemy!</emph> See that Irish Alderman—see that block-head on the other
                  side. See the panel of jurymen, all of them <emph>foreigners!</emph> What chance
                  have I?"</p>
               <p>"A poor one, Ernest; but for your friends' sake, fight a good battle. Do not let
                  it be said you were conquered without resistance."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> resist! I will, before I am sentenced to a felon's cell,
                  curse those who send me there. I will pray God to revenge me—for I will soon be
                  beyond the power of taking vengeance in my own hands. shall not survive my
                  sentence many days. I have lost all that is worth caring for."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Ernest. Do not say that. You have warm and true friends who will cling
                  closely to you in the hour of trouble. For their sake engage a lawyer—do not deny
                  me—I will see to it myself;—there is James M. Somers, a man of genius and heart.
                  Engage him at once—if not for yourself, do it to satisfy your friends—you must not
                  be sacrificed without an effort."</p>
               <p>"Efforts will be in vain!" said Cramer, sadly, but firmly. "I employ Mr. Somers at
                  your request, but it is throwing money away."</p>
               <p>After saying this, Cramer passed across the room and addressed the lawyer alluded
                  to, as Mr. Somers. He was a man of about 35 years—a bland, intellectual-looking
                  man, whose appearance indicated both talent and firmness.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Somers!" said Cramer, "I did not intend to employ counsel in this case, but
                  my friends force me to do it."</p>
               <p>"Sir," replied the lawyer, "it is too late for me to do justice to your cause, but
                  I will do the best I can. At any rate, I will assist you in empanelling a jury. I
                  foresee a hard fight, even in that."</p>
               <p>The case commenced. The clerk of the Court, after one of the prosecuting attornies
                  had called up the case, commenced calling out the jury panel. The first name
                  called was</p>
               <p>"Michael O'Burns."</p>
               <p>"Here I am!" said the man, whose looks told us as well as his name what he was.
                  "Here I am, faith, and ready for yez."</p>
               <p>Mr. Somers proceeded to put the usual questions in regard to prejudice,
                  &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Is it prejudiced I am?" said the would-be juror. "Devil the bit! But I mane to do
                  my share in sindin' that heretic divil where he can't spake ill o' the likes o'
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"Do you think he is guilty?" asked Somers.</p>
               <p>One of the prosecutors here interfered, alleging the question to be improper; but
                  the Irishman was but too anxious to answer it.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sure an' I know he <emph>is!</emph> Sure an' he's a heretic and a
                     <emph>native!</emph>"</p>
               <p>For <emph>very</emph> shame the prosecutors set aside this juror; he had not been
                  properly drilled.</p>
               <p>The clerk now called another.</p>
               <p>"Hans Petrick!"</p>
               <p>A tall, red-faced, raw-boned man stood up. The usual questions was asked of him.
                  He stared stupidly at the lawyer, but made no answer. The question was repeated.
                  He answered but one word, yet that was enough to show the kind of jury which had
                  been <emph>selected</emph> for the occasion. His reply was brief; it was</p>
               <p>"Nix!"</p>
               <p>"Don't you understand English?" asked Mr. Somers</p>
               <p>"Nix!" replied the Dutchman.</p>
               <p>"Will the Court be pleased to have an <emph>interpreter</emph> in this case?"
                  asked Mr. Somers, in a tone of bitter irony.</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6961-00000145"/>
               <p>"The Court will not permit itself to be insulted, sir!" said the senior judge,
                  with all of the dignity of a theatrical "<hi rend="i"/>cadi," and
                     <emph>such</emph> a cadi!</p>
               <p>"We mean no insult to your Honor; but it seems that we cannot understand the state
                  of this juror's mind without an interpreter."</p>
               <p>"He will not serve; the clerk will call another!" said his Honor. The clerk
                  called:</p>
               <p>"John Simpson Simpkins!"</p>
               <p>"'Ere," replied a squeaking voice, and a thin, thread-and-needle-selling-looking
                  little fellow stepped forward. He, too, was asked if he could judge impartially,
                  according to the law as delivered by the Court, and the evidence of the
                  witnesses.</p>
               <p>"Pon my honor hi can!" he replied.</p>
               <p>"Where were you born, sir?" asked Somers.</p>
               <p>"That is not a fair question!" said the closest prosecutor.</p>
               <p>"Then I challenge him peremptorily!" said Somers; "I do not want my client tried
                  by a Cockney."</p>
               <p>"No personalities here, sir!" shouted the judge, looking ferocious as an angry
                     "<emph>Thomas cat</emph>."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to be personal in this case, your Honor!" said Somers blandly; "but
                  I see in the very nature of the jury list before us, a determination to have my
                  client, who is a free American, and well known for his <emph>American
                     principles</emph>, tried by a set of prejudiced foreigners; and I solemnly
                  protest against such infamous injustice."</p>
               <p>"Sit down, sir; sit down; do not force me by your insults to <unclear>commit
                     you</unclear> for a contempt of Court. We have the power, and will
                     <emph>use</emph> it, if this occurs again."</p>
               <p>"Shakspeare, your Honor, once said—''Tis excellent to have a giant's strength, but
                  it is cowardly to use it with a tyrant's hand, or words to that effect."</p>
               <p>"We, the Court, neither know Mr. Shakspeare, or care what he says. Go on, Mr.
                  Clerk, and call the jury!" shouted the judge.</p>
               <p>The next name called was:</p>
               <p>"Erastus Leaf?"</p>
               <p>A rather thin, pale-faced man arose.</p>
               <p>"He is an American, take him?" whispered Cramer to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Without objection, Mr. Leaf was sworn in.</p>
               <p>The next called was an Irishman, as bitter but more guarded than the first. In
                  vain did Somers try to have the court order his name from the panel, and at last
                  he was forced to use another peremptory challenge, which to him was a loss, for he
                  could only use <emph>five</emph>. The next was a Dutch grocer, and as he seemed a
                  little better than the rest, Somers did not object to him. Next came a grave,
                  serious-looking man—one whose face indicated firmness even to obstinacy. When
                  Somers saw him, he said to his client:</p>
               <p>"I like the looks of that man!"</p>
               <p>"I do not!" replied Cramer, "he looks as if his heart was in his pocket."</p>
               <p>"He will not judge in this case none the more against you, for that. He looks like
                  a miser, I acknowledge, but I think he is safe."</p>
               <p>"Let him in then!" said Ernest. But when the man was sworn in, he turned a look
                  upon the accused which made his heart sink. It was a look so full of malice—a
                  sneering glance of withering hate.</p>
               <p>"I feared him, my God I feared him!" muttered Cramer. "Whatever others may be on
                  their trial, he is an enemy."</p>
               <p>It is needless to carry out our description of the empanelling any farther. It
                  would be but a repetition of what has already occurred. Suffice it to say that
                  after a long and arduous struggle, Mr. Somers succeeded in getting a jury with
                     <emph>two American born men on it</emph>.</p>
               <p>And then the case was opened by the youngest of the prosecuting lawyers; as is
                  usually the case. He was bitter and personal against the accused; told the jury
                  that he would prove him guilty of the charge, and that he was a very wretch who
                  must be condemned.</p>
               <p>The lawyer, in a tone of malignant bitterness, went on in a harangue of an hour's
                  length, telling the jury what he would prove and what they must do. After he was
                  through, the prosecution called its witnesses. The first was the policemen who
                  arrested him, and swore that they were ordered so to do, by a superior, but that
                  they saw no act of the accused which looked like rioting; that he was walking
                     off<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6961-00000146"/> the ground when they arrested
                  him. But the next witness came forward, and swore that he heard the accused utter
                  seditious and riotous words—such as, "It is a shame Americans should be treated
                  so," &amp;c. &amp;c. For this, he <emph>said</emph>, he had ordered his arrest.
                  Then came a Greek policeman, who swore that after the troops were on the ground,
                  he had <emph>seen</emph> the accused standing in front of them, among the people,
                  telling them not to be afraid, there were only blank cartridges in their muskets.
                  This man's name should be recorded in big letters, for he did the thing up
                     <emph>brown</emph>, as will be seen by the after evidence. After this a
                  small-sized effeminate-looking fellow got up and swore that he had heard the
                  accused talk to two or three boys in a riotous manner. It is useless to spin out
                  our pages with a long description of examination and cross-examination. Suffice it
                  to say, that in no particular did they prove an overt act, or one thing of which
                  at least ten thousand people had not been guilty. Then the witnesses for the
                  defence were called. They were few, but they proved the utter falsity of some of
                  the witnesses for the prosecution. They proved that Cramer had been arrested an
                  half hour before the military arrived, which gave the direct lie to the evidence
                  of the policeman alluded to above. Mr. Somers, then expecting that his client
                  would be attacked, offered documents which carried proof of the good character of
                  Cramer from some of the first men of the nation, and among them the President of
                  the United States. But the Court would not for an instant stoop to listen to
                  these, or receive them. The defence then rested, and the first prosecuting
                  attorney arose. With all of the intrigue and cunning which belongs to a
                  professional lawyer, he touched upon all the evidence bearing against the
                  accused—appealed to the prejudices of the jury, blackened the character of the
                  accused—in short, turned every power of his mind into one mighty effort to procure
                  the conviction of the latter. Oh, how the red flush of indignation rushed up to
                  the brow of Cramer, as he was forced to sit still and hear his name belied, and
                  his character covered over with the slime of falsehood. For two or three long
                  hours did this man continue his tirade of abuse.</p>
               <p>Then, with flashing eyes, a face beaming with intelligence and indignation, and a
                  voice of bold and thrilling eloquence, did Somers arise to reply and defend his
                  client. With a master hand he unravelled the web which the other had so cunningly
                  knitted. Thread by thread he tore it apart, and exhibited his client out free and
                  clear from its guilt-involving meshes. He riddled the evidence of the witnesses;
                  showed the absurdity of one, the malice of another, the very <emph>perjury</emph>
                  of another. He took the whole case in his grasp; the field was all before him, and
                  he moved on and laid down his arguments as some skilful general manœuvers his army
                  on a battle-field. After having disposed of the evidence in the case, exhibited
                  its law points, and showed the impossibility of his client being justly convicted,
                  he turned to the little personal attacks which had been made upon that client's
                  character. Then his voice rose higher than ever, his feelings became more excited;
                  and while he <emph>defied</emph> the <emph>proof</emph> of what the other had
                  alleged, he condemned, as mean and unworthy of manhood, the course which had been
                  pursued against his client. He offered proof which would have crushed the lies
                  which had been spoken, and that court and that prosecution <emph>dare not accept
                     of it!</emph> He wound up an effort of eloquence which would have been an honor
                  to a Clay or a Webster, a speech of several hours in length, by an appeal to the
                  jury, in the name of God, to render justice to a wronged and persecuted man. To
                  forget all national feelings, to drop all prejudices, and to render a true verdict
                  in the case which could only justly result in the acquittal of his client. While
                  he was speaking, a pin might have been heard drop on the floor of the crowded
                  courtroom, so entranced was the vast audience; but when he closed, a murmur of
                  applause, which neither the court nor its officers could still, rolled from lip to
                  lip through the room. Had that jury <emph>then</emph> have been called upon for
                  their verdict, they would not have <emph>dared</emph> to bring in a verdict of
                  conviction.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the oldest of the prosecuting lawyers, a man who was then in the
                     <emph>private</emph> employ of Cramer's bitterest persecutors, rose to his
                  feet. His pale clammy face looked cold as frozen lard; his small grey eyes gleamed
                  with a penetrating glance first upon the accused and then upon the jury. With a
                  vindictive, sneering tone,<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6961-00000147"/> he began his
                  work. He, like the first prosecutors, endeavored to turn every word of evidence
                  against the accused—distorted that which appeared favorable, added and exaggerated
                  that which was against him. A long hour he thus spent in again twining the false
                  and cunning web of fancied guilt around the form of the victim This done, in a
                  style of bitterness which far exceeded his associated and with an eloquence worthy
                  a better cause, he launched out in a personal attack upon the accused. He painted
                  him as a fiend fit only for the burning plains of hell, as a man to be feared, and
                  therefore to be bound on earth within a prison's walls to keep him from doing
                  harm. Fiend-like, he alluded to his domestic affairs, and so worked upon the
                  audience that they who <emph>knew</emph> Cramer was no rioter, began to believe he
                  was a terrible man. Thus, he went on, and thus he closed. The accused had no
                  chance to reply. By the false rules of justice in this State, the accusers have
                  the last words, and though they state falsehoods, or blacken the case ever so
                  much, the accused must sit silent and see his fate placed in the hands of a jury
                  who hear his guilt thundered in their ears to the very last moment.</p>
               <p>And now came the time for the judge to deliver his charge. He rose, and with as
                  bitter, yet calmer malice than the others, proceeded to review the evidence. He
                  laid particular stress upon the evidence of the policeman, who <emph>swore</emph>
                  that he had seen Cramer standing in the crowd, in front of the military, telling
                  the people that the soldiers had no balls in their muskets, even though other
                  witnesses for the prosecution swore that the young man had been arrested and
                  confined long before the troops had arrived on the ground, or were sent for. Oh,
                  how <emph>just</emph> a charge! He then, coward-like, launched into invectives
                  against the defence the prisoner and his noble-hearted counsel had made, and
                  closed his <emph>written</emph> and deliberately prepared charge, with a statement
                  that the jury <emph>could not</emph> acquit the accused. He might have saved
                  himself the trouble, they never intended to.</p>
               <p>But there was one man among them, and he a Dutchman, (be it said to his honor,)
                  that could not for two hours be brought to agree with his companions. That man
                  felt that he was doing a great wrong, and <emph>all</emph> of the Christian had
                  not yet been banished from his heart. It was the <emph>first</emph> time he had
                  served on a <emph>New York jury</emph>. But after the two hours had passed, they
                  returned, and their verdict was— <q>
                     <p>"GUILTY."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The judge did not immediately proceed to sentence the victim. He wished a night to
                  prepare for the closing scene of the drama—a night to study out the cruellest
                  tortures which he could inflict upon his fallen foe. Therefore he announced that
                  the sentence would be given in the morning, and Cramer, still under heavy bail,
                  was allowed freedom till the next day! Why? Because they vainly thought that he
                  would fly from their reach, and go forth a wandering fugitive with the brand of
                     <emph>convict</emph> on his name, and that thus they would be forever rid of
                  his presence, and secure from the influence of one whom they deemed lost and
                  disgraced. They thought their foe was forever crushed.</p>
               <p>But they knew him not. Where was he on that night? With the <emph>one</emph> true
                  and trusty friend—the one noble and honorable man, who never had failed or
                  faltered; he was preparing calmly to go to a felon's cell—arranging his business,
                  directing his affairs. All of that weary, terrible night, was thus passed. Ere
                  morning came, he wrote one line to her whom even through all his sorrow and his
                  wrongs he yet loved. It was this:</p>

                  <head>THE SENTENCE</head>
                  <p>Morning came. The hour was ten. The court-room was crowded with friends and
                     foes to the accused—so crowded that no more could pass through the door.
                     Anxiety rested on all countenances save one, and his was calm and placid as if
                     he were not about to be doomed to lose man's <emph>dearest</emph> privilege,
                     his LIBERTY. Friends had he there whose eyes were tearful, whose hearts
                     throbbed all mournfully. Friends had he there, who, had but the word been
                     uttered from his<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6961-00000148"/> lips, would have
                     borne him away, even had death stood in their path, rather than to have seen
                     him sent to a loathsome prison cell! Friends who looked upon him as a wronged
                     man, and gazed with hate and scorn upon those who had so foully wronged him.
                     There were foes there, too, who sneered in the joy of their fiendish triumph;
                     who now approached their helpless enemy, as some cowardly serf approaches the
                     body of the dead lion—<emph>brave</emph> to exceeding valor, where no further
                     danger was to be apprehended.</p>
                  <p>But to the sentence. The clerk of the Court asked, as usual:</p>
                  <p>"Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say why the sentence of the law
                     should not be passed upon you?"</p>
                  <p>Ernest rose to his feet, and first calmly turning his eyes to every face in
                     that room, he turned to the Court, and fixing his gaze upon the judge, said, in
                     a tone clear as a bugle-horn, and without a tremor:</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> I have to say that I have been tried by an unjust and
                     prejudiced Court; convicted by a prejudiced jury, through the evidence of
                     witnesses, more than one of whom have deliberately perjured themselves before
                     God and man!</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> I have this to say, and I call upon this audience to listen
                     to my words. I stand here as innocent of crime as the unborn babe—stand here,
                     because it has been deemed '<emph>a necessary evil</emph>' to crush me—because
                     a victim must be found to screen those who actually were guilty, and who are
                     better friends to, and more useful at <emph>election</emph> times to the
                     authorities of this city than I, who will neither bring bullies to the polls,
                     or sell a freeman's vote to party purposes.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> I have this to say, and before high Heaven I speak it—this
                     Court and that jury <emph>knows</emph> that I am innocent. I go, sir, to my
                     cell, as the martyrs of old went to the stake, conscious that I am right, and
                     fearless of all pain and all suffering, while I am right. And, sir, the day is
                     not far off, when, tried by the calm judgment of the community, my innocence
                     will be made known, your injustice thundered in your ear, and you will feel
                     that this is the meanest hour of your whole life. Now, sir, asking <emph>no
                        favors</emph>, and <emph>expecting</emph> none, (for I know how you hate
                     me,) I await all you <emph>can</emph> or <emph>dare</emph> to do! Go on, I am
                     ready!"</p>
                  <p>Several times, during the short speech of Cramer, had the Court sought to stop
                     him, but he knew it was his last chance, and nothing but brute force could put
                     him down.</p>
                  <p>When the judge arose his face was pale with anger. His lips quivered with the
                     excess of it. Fixing his eyes upon the prisoner, in a tone more of sarcasm than
                     of dignity, he proceeded at length with a cruelly insulting review of the
                     trial. He taunted the helpless prisoner with cowardice, saying that he had
                     committed the crime of which he was convicted, and now was too cowardly to
                     acknowledge it—he then, with a bitterness of expression which argued the malice
                     in his heart, regretted the law did not give him power to inflict a heavier
                     sentence upon the prisoner, aye, almost wept, because he could only send that
                     young man to herd with felons for a single year, as if a year in prison is not
                     a life-time to the young, the sensitive, the proud and the ambitious man. Had
                     that judge then possessed the power of life and death, who will doubt but that
                     he would have sentenced his victim to the scaffold, instead of the prison. He
                     closed by inflicting the fullest sentence which the law allowed him to give,
                     renewing his regret that he could not place a heavier load upon the breaking
                     heart of his victim.</p>
                  <p>Cramer said but three words when he heard this. "My poor mother!" he murmured—a
                     quiver ran through his heart, then he was calm as before. But the noble
                     audience were so astonished and so indignant at the unheard of cruelty of the
                     judge, that a hiss—a hiss of scorn and censure followed him as he sat down.
                     Tears, too, were rolling down many a manly cheek of those sons of toil, who had
                     left their work to come and learn the fate of the "friend of the working man."
                     As the officers bore the "CONVICT" from the Court-room, the crowd followed;
                     each man of them expressing some word of sympathy, or trying to say some
                     cheering thing to him.</p>
                  <p>"Cheer up, Ernest!" cried one. "The Governor won't let you stay there a
                     week!"</p>
                  <p>"No," cried another, "fifty thousand men will sign a petition to get you
                     out!"</p>
                  <p>"Would to God I could go in your place!" said another.</p>
                  <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6961-00000149"/>
                  <p>"Farewell, boys!" cried Cramer, as he stepped into the carriage that waited to
                     bear him away—"farewell—my time will come yet! I am not conquered!</p>
                  <p>Wildly rose nine hearty cheers from the honest lips of those who heard those
                     words. And as many a rough hand was raised to brush the stranger-tear from
                     toil-bronzed cheeks, the carriage drove off. In it, beside Cramer, sat the
                     faithful friend we have before alluded to. His noble heart was so full of grief
                     that he could not speak. A stranger who knew neither, would have supposed that
                        <emph>he</emph>, and not Cramer, was the one who was about to be barred from
                     the light of day, and the cheerful faces of loving friends. Cramer, nerved for
                     this crisis, determining not to appear to feel, even though his heart was
                     breaking, seemed as cheerful and calm as he had when borne in a different
                     direction, as he rode beside his fair young bride to the church, where both had
                     vowed solemnly to cling to the other until death did them part. He tried in
                     vain to make his friend feel cheerful. Even the stern officer, who sat before
                     him, used as he was to conveying prisoners to their doom, felt sad and
                     wretched. But this story has been already drawn out to a great length. One more
                     scene will close it.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>It was one week later! In a dark cell, three feet and a half wide, by seven
                     feet long, with an iron door, stone walls above, around and below, paced Ernest
                     Cramer, the convict. The furniture of that cell was a fine board to sleep on, a
                     wooden block for a pillow, and three thin, dirty blankets. No books—not a
                     light, except the straggling rays which stole through the upper part of his
                     grated, iron prison door, which, faint as it was, cast upon his face sufficient
                     light to show that he was deathly pale—his eyes sunken in their sockets—his
                     features already haggard with misery and suffering. <emph>Six days had he been
                        in that prison, and food had not passed his lips.</emph> Had he,
                     coward-like, been trying to starve himself to death and commit suicide? No! But
                     a breaking heart had arisen up into his very throat and choked him. He could
                     not eat. He could not even weep. All were strangers around—all seemed
                     merciless, cold and cruel! Though feeling hearts were near him, he knew it not!
                     Though the good and the pure were close at hand, sympathising with him, he knew
                     it not.</p>
                  <p>On the afternoon of the sixth day, while he paced to and from the space which
                     with three short steps he measured, a paper was thrust through the bars to him.
                     He eagerly grasped it, for it was the first paper he had seen in prison. One
                     glance, and he knew it to be the sheet of his enemy, the Scotch fiend,
                        <emph>Gordon,</emph> who had done so much to procure his conviction. A
                     second glance, and he saw his own name—a moment more, a groan echoed through
                     that wretched cell and Ernest Cramer fell lifeless on the damp stone floor. He
                     had dreamed for the first time that his wife had totally deserted him—saw then,
                     and there, for the first time, that while he was bound and helpless, she had
                     obtained a <emph>divorce!</emph> How long he lay stretched upon that cold
                     floor, as one dead, he knew not—he only knew when he awoke to wretchedness and
                     life, that now his cup of misery was full. When she whom he loved more than
                        <emph>life</emph> deserted him, what had he to live for! When he arose, he
                     was calmer, but it was the calmness of utter despair. He read the paper—read
                     the <emph>false</emph> affidavit upon which the divorce was founded; saw
                     himself held up to the world as false and faithless to his marriage vows. Oh,
                     how his brain burned at all this! Had he been <emph>free</emph>, he would not
                     then have been helpless, nor should the despised wretches have gone unpunished
                     Casting down the paper, he again paced to and fro in that dreary cell. He was
                     verging on madness. He already felt that a few short hours would close his
                     career. If he could have <emph>wept</emph>, he might be safe. But he could not.
                     A burning fire was consuming his very life.</p>
                  <p>Night came on again! The prisoner's food was offered him, but with loathing he
                     turned from it—he would not, he could not eat. And he was not even hungry,
                     throughout all of his long fast. True, he was faint, growing weaker hour by
                     hour, yet he heeded it not—did not care, in truth. If he had strength, for what
                     was it destined? To be used in company with the slaves of crime—the thief, the
                     burglar and murderer! My God, to think that an <emph>innocent</emph> man should
                     be condemned to that! And yet more than one <emph>has</emph> been—while real
                     criminals have hobbed and nobbed, and caroused in glee with the<pb n="296-297"
                        xml:id="VAC6961-00000150"/> very judges in this city. Oh, men of New York,
                     how long shall this be? You know it is so!</p>
                  <p>Night came on, and the hall lamps of the prison threw a faint and flickering
                     light upon the walls of Cramer's cell—a light laying in shadowed checks upon
                     the wall, for it shone through massive grates of iron. Feebler grew the steps
                     of Cramer—fainter beat his pulse—colder was his brow. Suddenly he heard his
                     name called in a kind, low, sweet voice—the voice of a woman. Who could it be
                     of that angel sex, who spoke in tones of kindness through those bars. He knew
                     not, cared not—his heart was dead to all of womankind. But he replied, and
                     asked what was wanted. In a low, kind tone, the lady begged him to eat food
                     which she had prepared with her own hands.</p>
                  <p>"I am not hungry! I <emph>cannot</emph> eat!" said Cramer, faintly.</p>
                  <p>"But you are starving yourself—committing suicide, which is wrong in the sight
                     of God!" continued the lady.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot help it—I cannot help it!" murmured the wretched man.</p>
                  <p>"Have you not a <emph>mother?</emph> In her name, I beg you do as I ask!" said
                     the lady</p>
                  <p>"A mother! A mother! Oh, my poor mother!" groaned Cramer, and then he burst
                     into tears. The flood-gates of his soul had been unlocked by that magic name—he
                     wept tears, <emph>blessed</emph> tears! They saved his life. For long hours
                     that night he wept, and then when he became calm, he knelt down and prayed to
                     Almighty God to support him in his hour of trouble. And when they next brought
                     him food, he ate—not with any appetite, but with a calm determination to
                     preserve himself for the future. And to the kind and never-to-be-forgotten lady
                     of the Warden of that prison, he felt that he owed his life. Had he not wept
                     that night, he would have died—and she through her motherly kindness alone,
                     brought tears up from the burning depths of his heart.</p>
                  <p>And, the reader will ask, where were his Eminence, Judas Iscariot Arnold, and
                     our other "<emph>friends</emph>," all this time, and where had they been during
                     the trial of the victim. In the back-ground, working the wires for his
                     conviction and divorce."</p>

                  <p>The Royalist Daughters. By ALEXANDER DUMAS. Octavo 50</p>
                  <p>This book bears the unmistakable impress of being coined in the same mint that
                     produced "Monte Cristo," and the "Three Guardsmen." The period chosen by the
                     author is one of the most interesting in the history of modern France—when the
                     Duchess de Berri (the only <emph>man,</emph> according to Napoleon, of the
                     Bourbon family,) made her desperate attempt to overturn the throne of the
                     Orleans dynasty. The twin daughters of the old royalist noble are two of the
                     most interesting characters ever delineated; their wondrous beauty—their sad,
                     early history—their intrepid style of dashing after the hounds—together with
                     their solitary life in the ancient castle—invest them with every element of
                     romantic interest. The book is rich in other marked characters, and incidents
                     press on incidents with unceasing rapidity.</p>

                  <p>Everybody has heard of "Sam Slick the Clockmaker," and he has given his opinion

                     Cow," and "The Dog," and so on; why shouldn't there be one on "The Gals?" They
                     are about the most difficult to choose and to manage of any created critter,
                     and there aint any dependable directions about pickin' and choosin' of them. Is
