&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
STRIKING THE rLA~Q.&#xD;
"BEAD that, Valerie! "said General Ayl-&#xD;
mer, as he strode hastily to his daughter's&#xD;
side, and tossed an open letter into her lap.&#xD;
Now, being* a man little addicted to&#xD;
choleric impulses, the passionate tone in&#xD;
which he spoke-the very act itself-were&#xD;
so different from his usual voice and man-&#xD;
ner, that the girl whom he addressed start-&#xD;
ed perceptibly. Then, instead of touching&#xD;
the letter, she looked up with evident aston-&#xD;
ishment into his face.&#xD;
"Why, papa! " she said, after an instant&#xD;
-and her tone of surprisespoke volumes&#xD;
for her father's usual amiability-" what&#xD;
can the matter be? Nothing about Eugene,&#xD;
I h6pe?" she added, anxiously.&#xD;
"No-nothing about Eugene."&#xD;
"Something about the New-Orleans&#xD;
business, then?"&#xD;
"No;. certainly not."&#xD;
"Then what-"&#xD;
"Suppose you read the letter 3" inter-&#xD;
rupted her father, with an impatient acerbi-&#xD;
ty altogether new to him. And as she pro-&#xD;
ceeded to obey a suggestion,' the tone of&#xD;
which made it a command, he turned from&#xD;
her, and began to walk restlessly up and&#xD;
down the long piazza, with a very flushed&#xD;
and angry counteliance.&#xD;
It was plain that something of more than&#xD;
ordinary importance had gone wrong with&#xD;
thegexe~al; since, under ordinary, and even&#xD;
~xtraordhiary inisforttu~es, his philosophy&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
was invariably that of the Stoic, with a&#xD;
strong dash of the Epicurean. "Grieving&#xD;
over a loss never yet helped a man to* bear&#xD;
it," the general was wont to say; and few&#xD;
people ever reduced theory to more perfect&#xD;
practice. C/he sard, *ar4 had been his life-&#xD;
long motto; resignation, strongly tinctured&#xD;
with indifference, his life-long mode of.&#xD;
meeting danger or di~lculty; and this de.&#xD;
bonsir creed had borne him lightly. ~and&#xD;
scatlilessly through mai~y a peril, ~and ever&#xD;
many a misfortune which would utterly&#xD;
have wrecked ordinary men. There had&#xD;
been more than enough of these peril~'a~d&#xD;
misfortunes in their time, yet they had&#xD;
scarcely marked a line on his, fra&amp;amp;ik~ ha~id-&#xD;
some face, or tempered by a shade his&#xD;
genial, pleasant manner.~ So~ it followed&#xD;
that in all the gay and hospitaWe country-&#xD;
side of St. Stephen's Parish; L~iiisiaua, ~io&#xD;
man was more popular, ormo~'e ~3.eservingof&#xD;
popularity, than GeiieralAyImero!~Ayliner~.&#xD;
No man understood half so well the art of&#xD;
pleasing all men-and nil women~ too-wi~1i&#xD;
hardly an effort ~eyo~xa th~t~ot the ~wiU~ ~zto&#xD;
man better united knowledge of ~thQ wQ~r~d&#xD;
with the ~onAomie of his open-hs~ided,*p~u-&#xD;
hearted race; no'man lived~ faster; and yet&#xD;
few men ever suffered less in the. opinion&#xD;
of~ society. Indeed, he wasone ofthoezcep-&#xD;
ti4nal people wh6seeinbornto rule~opinion,&#xD;
instead of being ruled by it-.4hough why&#xD;
this was sQit would be hard toi~y. The&#xD;

should be apt to find ourselves sadly at a open in their hospitable welcome, and the&#xD;

&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
ness, social or otherwise, unless we accept&#xD;
as a solution the plausible theory of a spe-&#xD;
cial ruling faculty. If there be such a thing,&#xD;
General Aylmer undoubtedly possessed it&#xD;
in singular degree. It had made him a man&#xD;
of mark andinfluence all his life; it had ren-&#xD;
dered him foremost in every enterprise in&#xD;
which he engaged, from his college esca-&#xD;
pades and early social triumphs, to the po-&#xD;
litical successes and military renoWn of later&#xD;
life; and yet, in what it consisted, his near-&#xD;
est friend could not have told. "He had a&#xD;
wonderful way with him," they all said;&#xD;
and there they stopped. The secret of his&#xD;
fascination seemed as subtle as the charm&#xD;
of his hospitality-a hospitality which had&#xD;
been quite famous during the anoiem re'-&#xD;
gime, and' still held its own bravely,' even&#xD;
under the changed aspect of affairs. For&#xD;
affairs had changed very much in the year&#xD;
eighteen hundred and sixty-five, when our&#xD;
story opens; and General Aylmer, like the&#xD;
rest of his class and geuei~ation, had paid, in&#xD;
subjection to wholesale robbery, the penalty&#xD;
of being a gentleman by birth, and an aristo-&#xD;
crat ~y position. Yet it chanced that For-&#xD;
tune had been a degree kinder to him than&#xD;
to many of his compeers. After that terri-&#xD;
ble end-that end full of bitterness and deg-&#xD;
radation unutterable !-which came with&#xD;
the earlyroses of the fair Southern April,&#xD;
he returned to the home from which for&#xD;
four long years he had 'been an exile, and&#xD;
found that this home had fared somewhat&#xD;
better than ha had dared either to hope or&#xD;
expect. Defaced and injured it was, un-&#xD;
doubtedly, but in less degree than most of&#xD;
the habitations near at hand, and certainly~&#xD;
not irreparably, since1 in a short time, some-&#xD;
thing of the old beauty began to appear&#xD;
again-something of Eden to bloom once&#xD;
more out of Sahara. The general was not a&#xD;
man to sit down in useless refining, and still&#xD;
less was he a man to tolerate, even for a day,&#xD;
the least discomfort which effort could re-&#xD;
move. So, the plundered rooms were refur-&#xD;
nished; the empty stables and cellars at least&#xD;
inoderatelyrefilled; thetrampledshrubberies&#xD;
trained into order; 'the barren fields put&#xD;
under cultivation; the great doors thrown&#xD;
&#xD;
STRUNG T~E FLAG.                      7&#xD;
&#xD;
In view of these facts, it was not singu-&#xD;
lar that St. Stephen's Parish returned quick-&#xD;
ly enough to its old allegiance-swearing&#xD;
as cordially by the general's wine and the&#xD;
general's horses as it had ever done in the&#xD;
past. And yet it was not singular, either,&#xD;
that, once safely out of the domain of Ayl-&#xD;
mers, the parish did not hesitate to shrug&#xD;
its shoulders, and ask very injuredly, how&#xD;
the deuce he managed it. He was a man&#xD;
whose apparent sources of wealth were no&#xD;
greater than those of his~ neighbors; but,&#xD;
while they were daily forced into closer re-&#xD;
trenchment, 1'he had resumed a mode of life&#xD;
which bordered closely on extra~ragance.&#xD;
It was very pleasant, of course, to know that&#xD;
one house at least was yet open, where a&#xD;
capital dinner 'and a good mount were al-&#xD;
ways ready for a friend, where the best of&#xD;
Hochheimer and the best of cigars were&#xD;
things at command, and the brightest of&#xD;
eyes smiled a welcome; but still that did&#xD;
not solve the puzzle as to how he managed&#xD;
it; and this rendered the pleasure something&#xD;
of a discomfort also. "To be sure, it is&#xD;
none of my business," everybody said; but&#xD;
then everybody felt that he or she would very&#xD;
much like to know~ True, the general was&#xD;
the lucky possessor of a rich father-in-law,&#xD;
to whose fortune his daughter was sole heir-&#xD;
ess; but this father-in-law, so far from being&#xD;
an~ old man, likely to step off the scene at&#xD;
any moment, was a man of little more than&#xD;
middle-age, who, not long before, had taken&#xD;
unto himself a new wife, and apparently a&#xD;
new lease of life; so his existence was&#xD;
scarcely to be assumed a solution of the&#xD;
enigma. Then, although Gerald Aylmer&#xD;
was the most "steady'~ of young men, and&#xD;
really an excellent planter, there was&#xD;
Eugene, the handsome scapegrace, whose&#xD;
dissipation and recklessness were known to&#xD;
all the parish, and who had gone to Europe&#xD;
immediately after the close of the war,&#xD;
where of course he was spending any&#xD;
amount of money. While, as for Valerie-&#xD;
but the extravagance of General Aylmer's&#xD;
only daughter had been known to her&#xD;
friends and neighbors ~o long that they had&#xD;
ceased to marvel over any fresh manifesta-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion of it, and indeed considered it rather a&#xD;
commendable quality in the presumptive&#xD;
heiress and beauty-regnant, who was chief&#xD;
among the charms of Aylmers. For other&#xD;
men might possess horses as good, and wine&#xD;
as unexceptionable, but no other man could&#xD;
possibly boast, as head of his household, the&#xD;
loveliest girl of the Mississippi Yalley, the&#xD;
queen of a hundred loyal hearts, the toast&#xD;
of a hundred gallant lips, from the Potomac&#xD;
to the Rio Grande.&#xD;
All of these things, Valerie Aylmer&#xD;
made good her claim to be esteemed, and&#xD;
yet her head was not absolutely giddy-a&#xD;
fact which in itself entitles her to respectful&#xD;
consideration. She had been a beauty and&#xD;
an heiress from her cradle; she was clever&#xD;
enough to hold her own in any fair intel-&#xD;
lectual tilt without falling under the terrible&#xD;
odium of being blue; and she was, besides,&#xD;
thorough mistress of all the thousand fas-&#xD;
cinations which some exceptional women&#xD;
possess, and which are more charming than&#xD;
the beauty of Helen, or the dower of a prin-&#xD;
cess; and yet, if it is impossible to saythatehe&#xD;
was quite unspoiled (for that would be saying&#xD;
she was an angel, and no woman at all), it&#xD;
is at least possible to say that the spoiling&#xD;
had not done her much harm. It had made&#xD;
her wilful and daring, and fond of her pow-&#xD;
er, perhaps; but it had not darkened over&#xD;
the sweet, frank charm of her girlhood with&#xD;
even so much as a shade ~f that intense self-&#xD;
appreciation, that offensive vanity, and more&#xD;
offensive affectation, which make bellehood&#xD;
a thing to be dreaded rather than desired&#xD;
for any girl. "A shameful coquette," people&#xD;
called Miss Aylmer; but they said it half in&#xD;
jest; and never a man or woman of them&#xD;
all loved her the less for her gay flirtations.&#xD;
She amused herself with the admiration of-&#xD;
fered her, and broke hearts, as it is called,&#xD;
by the dozen; but it was so much as a child&#xD;
accepts sugar-plums and demolishes play-&#xD;
things, that even the very victims would&#xD;
not have had the heart to deny her the en-&#xD;
joyment, "It is so pleasant to be pretty&#xD;
and to be admired," she said once to an in-&#xD;
timat~ friend; and the sentence embodied&#xD;
her whole opinion on the subject. It was&#xD;
so pleasant to feel that, whoever looked on&#xD;
her, desired to look agaiu-so pleasant to&#xD;
&#xD;
know that, go where she would, she carried&#xD;
a talisman, potent ever to win kindness and&#xD;
service-.-so pleasant that men strove with&#xD;
each other which of them should do most to&#xD;
gain even such a trifling favor as her hand&#xD;
for a dance-so pleasant that the roses of life&#xD;
and love were all scattered, as it were,&#xD;
under her very feet! She exulted in it, and&#xD;
enjoyed it, with the pull, glad exultation, the&#xD;
keen, fresh enjoyment of youth, when youth&#xD;
has known few troubles. And her troubles&#xD;
had been very few; for even the war, with&#xD;
its attendant horrors, had fallen lightly on&#xD;
her 1~ead. She had seen havoc and death&#xD;
around, but it had not been brought home&#xD;
to her, since her father and brothers came&#xD;
safely through the baptism of blood. She&#xD;
had been exiled from her birthplace, but&#xD;
she had roughed it very gayly in camps and&#xD;
beleaguered cities, shedding the glory of her&#xD;
youth and beauty wherever she went. Con-&#xD;
sidering her many attractions, it was scarcely&#xD;
wonderful that her fame spread far and wide,&#xD;
or that few women of her day and genera-&#xD;
tion counted more loyal subjects. Yet her&#xD;
beauty was only the beauty of her country-&#xD;
women intensified to superlative degr~e-&#xD;
only the graceful features, the pearly com-&#xD;
plexion, the soft, dark eyes, and silken-dark&#xD;
hair, which we meet in every wayside vil-&#xD;
lage, from Maryland to Mexico, making a&#xD;
type of loveliness that is to be found under&#xD;
no other sky. Of all of these personal gifts,&#xD;
Miss Aylmer possessed a trifle more than&#xD;
her due share, together with something&#xD;
which rendered them specially and entirely&#xD;
her own. It is very hard to draw the exact&#xD;
line where prettiness-which is so common&#xD;
-ends, and where beauty-which is so rare&#xD;
-begins. And the effort to do so is nQt&#xD;
made more easy by the fact that a great&#xD;
many people never draw such a line at alj;&#xD;
never trouble themselves to remember that&#xD;
there is any higher standard than that of&#xD;
their own individual~ taste; or that a face&#xD;
which seems to them all loveliness may,&#xD;
without losing a tittle of this loveliness; fall&#xD;
outside the magic circle of beauty, because&#xD;
its tints lack harmony or its fetitures fall&#xD;
in proportion. Yet, nevertheless, there are&#xD;
certain plain rules of art, which, if we&#xD;
choose to call. them in, settle' the matter&#xD;
&#xD;

very summarily. One of these rules-4he J over with sunny lights and soft languors&#xD;
&#xD;
most absolute, perhaps, among them-de-&#xD;
clares thatperfection of physical beautycon-&#xD;
sists, above all things, in finish of detail; and,&#xD;
judged by this test, Valerie Aylmer's beauty&#xD;
was perfect. From head to foot she was&#xD;
without a flaw, and in her own style (of&#xD;
course it was a matter of taste whether or&#xD;
not one admired that style) quite faultless.&#xD;
She wa~ tall-taller than the medium&#xD;
height of her sex-but with nothing what:&#xD;
ever "grand" or Amazonian abouther. On&#xD;
the contrary, her figure, which was exqui-&#xD;
sitely proportioned and rounded, had a&#xD;
charming womanliness all its own, and was&#xD;
daintily slender-though straight as a palm,&#xD;
and flexible as a water-lily. From the small&#xD;
neck, down to the shapely feet, there was&#xD;
not an angular line about her, not a curve&#xD;
which was not the ourve of beauty, o1~ on&#xD;
which an artist's eye would not have de-&#xD;
lighted to rest.' Consequent upon this, she&#xD;
possessed that gift which is even more rare&#xD;
than beauty-superlative grace. One could&#xD;
not, imagine her doing an awkward thing.&#xD;
In all her moods-and they were many-in&#xD;
all her alternations of bearing and manner,&#xD;
she never lost this distinction; and was&#xD;
charming always, principally because' she&#xD;
was graceful always. Her face was ln'une,&#xD;
possessing a complexion clear enough to&#xD;
show every pulsation of the blood beneath,&#xD;
and smooth as a camellia petab-a complex-&#xD;
ion that lay like ivory on the brow and tem-&#xD;
ples, but seemed charged with a flush of&#xD;
rosy color, covered, as it were, with a sort&#xD;
of roseate veil, on the lower part of the face.&#xD;
It is not often that such a complexion is&#xD;
seen; and the difficulty of finding is only&#xD;
equalled by the difficulty of describing it.&#xD;
It is more brunette than blond, for its tints&#xD;
are all rich and warm; butt it is absolutely&#xD;
neither-it is something between the two,&#xD;
and more beautiful than either. When the&#xD;
flush deepened on Valerie's fare, she 'was&#xD;
positively dazzling, for it was as vivid and&#xD;
clearas the hue of the pon~egranate; but,&#xD;
even in her hours of lassitude, she was never&#xD;
wholly without color-only then it pervaded&#xD;
the skin like the delicate' pink that lines a&#xD;
sea-shell. Her eyes'were large and dark&#xD;
and lustrous; magnificent eyes, all flooding&#xD;
&#xD;
-eyes that would have lifted into the&#xD;
splendor of beauty the plainest face alive.&#xD;
The brow above them was very fine' and&#xD;
pure of outline; exquisitely finished about&#xD;
the setting of the eyes, and, where the slen-&#xD;
der, dark line' ~of 'the eyebrows ran, broad,&#xD;
somewhat square, and framed in abundant&#xD;
masses of rich, dark hair. Her nose gave all&#xD;
the distinction to the face which it is in the&#xD;
power of a feature of perfect symmetry to&#xD;
bestow. It was Greek, as far as a nose per-&#xD;
fectly straight in itself, yet not straight from&#xD;
the brow, can be held to appertain to the&#xD;
Greek type; and about the delicate, arched&#xD;
nostril there was a look of pride, only re-&#xD;
deemed by the sweetness of the mouth,&#xD;
whose crimson lips made a Cupid's bow&#xD;
beneath it. Looking at Miss Aylmer, it&#xD;
was impossible not to perceive the physical&#xD;
traces of French blood; and in listening to her&#xD;
voice, or watching her manner, you caught&#xD;
many a token in which, even through the&#xD;
lapse of two generations, fair Provence&#xD;
claimed her child. There was all the gift&#xD;
of ready wit and fancy, the saucy eerve and&#xD;
soft tendresse, which appertain to the wom-&#xD;
en of France above all other women, and&#xD;
which had already ensnared more willing&#xD;
captives than even the light of her lustrous&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
Those eyes looked up at her father now&#xD;
with something more than surprise in their&#xD;
depths-a shadow of unusual gravity was&#xD;
gathering in them.&#xD;
"I am afraid this decision is very disap-.&#xD;
pointing to you, papa.," she said.&#xD;
"Disappointing!" cried General Ayl-&#xD;
me; almost fiercely. "It is-" He stopped&#xD;
and swallowed the remainder of his sen-&#xD;
tence-not without a considerable gulp.&#xD;
"It does seem hard-when grandpapa&#xD;
has always taught us to regard his fortune&#xD;
as our own. But then, I suppose, we ought&#xD;
to remember that he has a right to dispose&#xD;
as he pleases of his own property; and-"&#xD;
"A man has no right to sacrifice his pos-&#xD;
itive duties to Quixotic sentiment," inter-&#xD;
rupted her father, impatiently. "In disin-&#xD;
heriting his rightful heirs, to endow a stran-&#xD;
ger with his wealth, he is guilty of nothing&#xD;
less than fraud!',&#xD;
&#xD;
STRIKING THE FLAG.                     9&#xD;
&#xD;
"But he did not disinherit mamma," said&#xD;
Valerie, simply.&#xD;
"What else is he virtually doing now?&#xD;
Her marriage-portion was a mere bagatefle&#xD;
compared to the magnificent fortune which&#xD;
he is about to will away from her represent-&#xD;
atives."                             -&#xD;
"But this boy-our cousin-does not his&#xD;
claim seem to be at least equal to ours?"&#xD;
"Equal to ours!" repeated the general,&#xD;
too angry to be quite as punctilious as usual&#xD;
in the proprieties of conversation-" why,&#xD;
he is only XE. Vacquant's nephew, and you&#xD;
are the daughter of his only child. And&#xD;
even the claim of relationship itself was for-&#xD;
feited by the conduct of his mother, who&#xD;
married some fortune-hunting adventurer-&#xD;
an Irish painter, I believe-in open opposi-&#xD;
tion to the wishes of her brother. Why&#xD;
your grandfather should suddenly have tak-&#xD;
en up her son in this manner, is beyond my&#xD;
~~~prehension.i~&#xD;
"He was in our army, was he not?"&#xD;
"Yes-but what has that to do with&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
Miss Aylmer's glance fell on the open&#xD;
page of time letter again, some part of which&#xD;
seemed to attract her attention; for, after a&#xD;
pause, she said:&#xD;
"Grandpapa seems to feel great remorse&#xD;
for his treatment of his sister."&#xD;
"He is late in manifesting it," said Gen-&#xD;
eral Aylmer, with a sneer. "She has been&#xD;
dead nearly thirty years."&#xD;
"AhI So long? Then this nephew of&#xD;
grandpapa's must be quite old."&#xD;
"Old enough to be a very clever saliemer,&#xD;
I should say; or he could not have suc-&#xD;
ceeded, as he has d9ne, in ingratiating him-&#xD;
self into the confidence of your grandfather,&#xD;
who is not a fool; or, perhaps I ought to&#xD;
say, was not a fool when I saw him last.&#xD;
He may be in his dotage now. Certainly&#xD;
his conduct justifies such a suspicion," he&#xD;
added bitterly.&#xD;
"It is very provoking," said Valerie,&#xD;
thoughtfully. "I don't wonder you are&#xD;
vexed, papa. But it is some consolation,&#xD;
is it not, that we don't need this money very&#xD;
much? I have often congratulated myself&#xD;
that we are not so poor as most of our&#xD;
friends-for poverty is dreadful I-and I re-&#xD;
&#xD;
joico still more now that this is so-4or&#xD;
your sake, papa. You are not fit to be a&#xD;
poor man. But we are not poor-compara-&#xD;
tively speaking," she went on-" and so we&#xD;
ought to be resigned, even if grandpapa does&#xD;
not give us his money. We can do without&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Do you know what doing without it&#xD;
means?" said her father, in a tone so al-&#xD;
tered from the merely impatient and irri-&#xD;
tated one in which he had before spoken, that&#xD;
she looked up with a startled expression of&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"It means ruin-that is all I-irretrieva-&#xD;
ble ruin," he responded, in answer to the&#xD;
look.&#xD;
He had been standing beside her as they&#xD;
talked, leaning against the pillar nearest&#xD;
the steps on which she sat; hut now he re-&#xD;
sumed his restless promenade of the piazza,&#xD;
while she remained ashehadleft her, but very&#xD;
still-the hand which had been toying idly*&#xD;
with the silver bells decorating the collar&#xD;
of a little spaniel, that was crouched at her&#xD;
side, now rested motionless on Sprite'ssilken&#xD;
coat, and her large eyes were full of a new-&#xD;
ly-awakened surprise and consternation.&#xD;
After a few turns, General Aylmer paused,&#xD;
and took up the thread ~f conversation&#xD;
where he had dropped it. "Yes-ruin!"&#xD;
he said, gloomily. "You think I have suf-&#xD;
fered less in fortune than most of our&#xD;
friends. You are mistaken. I have not&#xD;
thought it necessary to retrench in my style&#xD;
of living, as they have done, because I natu- -&#xD;
rally looked to the fortune you would in-&#xD;
herit as security against any difficulty&#xD;
about the debt I have been incurring.&#xD;
Failing this inheritance, thave no means of&#xD;
meeting my liabilities, excepting by the&#xD;
sale of my landed esti~te; and, if I de-&#xD;
cided to sacrifice that to-morrow, I should&#xD;
only be beggaring myself without materi-&#xD;
ally benefiting my creditors. I suppose&#xD;
Eugene shares your own delusion on the&#xD;
subject of my fortune, for he is as reck-&#xD;
lessly extravagant as ever; seems to consid-&#xD;
er himself still the son of the rich man I&#xD;
was; and the demands he has made on me,&#xD;
since he has been in Europe, have contrib-&#xD;
uted in no slight degree to involve me so&#xD;
deeply, that if I sold every acre of land I.&#xD;

possess-even the very soil around "-he&#xD;
waved his hand toward the prospect before&#xD;
them-" the very roof that shelters us-I&#xD;
should not, at the present nominal prices of&#xD;
propertyrealize half the amount of my in-&#xD;
debtedness."&#xD;
Valerie's eye had followed the motion of&#xD;
his hand as he was speaking, and still dwelt&#xD;
with wistful sadness on the familiar scene&#xD;
which was now enwrapped in the soft Octo-&#xD;
ber gloaming. Manyof the marks of wanton&#xD;
destruction, so painfully apparent by day-&#xD;
light, were concealed by this kindly veil;&#xD;
and something of its old serene beauty was&#xD;
in the scene. The rich sweep of emerald&#xD;
lawn (emerald now, although, not twelve&#xD;
months back, squadrons had charged, and&#xD;
men had bled and died there!) -the stately&#xD;
trees, whose tops rustled above the roof&#xD;
beneath which her eyes had first seen the&#xD;
light, as her mother's closed to it forever&#xD;
-the winding depths of shrubbery-the&#xD;
luxuriant garden all overgrown with wild&#xD;
beauty-the swelling fields that, alternating&#xD;
with woodlands, stretched as far as the eye&#xD;
could reach-and, on the other side, the&#xD;
rushing flood of the mighty Father of&#xD;
Waters!&#xD;
When she . looked again toward her&#xD;
father, her eyes were swimming in tears.&#xD;
"Oh, papa!'~ she cried, with mingled&#xD;
reproach and distress, "why did you not tell&#xD;
Eugene all this long ago? Why did you&#xD;
not tell both of us I-for I, too, have been&#xD;
very extravagant! If you had only told us,&#xD;
we should, like every one else, have learned&#xD;
economy."&#xD;
"Hum! ~ said the general, incredulously,&#xD;
"' it is very easy to talk of economy. Prac-&#xD;
tising it is a different thing-as you will&#xD;
soon find, if yott make the trial. It would&#xD;
be economy, for instance, not to order an&#xD;
expensive new dress for Mrs. Hautaine's par-&#xD;
ty next week-but-ha! "he gave a short,&#xD;
saroactic laugh, as his daughter's face changed&#xD;
perceptibly at the latter part of his sen-&#xD;
tence.-" there - you see now that theory&#xD;
and practice are by no means the same."&#xD;
It was true that Valerie's face bad fallen&#xD;
'when the matter was brought thus directly&#xD;
and feelingly home to her. She looked very&#xD;
'blank, indae~, for an instant; but then she&#xD;
&#xD;
rallied-and the light laugh of amusement&#xD;
that burst from her lips contrasted strangely&#xD;
with her father's cynical mirth of the mo-&#xD;
ment before.&#xD;
"It is not pleasant to practise economy,&#xD;
I admit," she said, becoming serious again.&#xD;
"We had enough of it during the war. But&#xD;
it can be done. You shall see, papa, that&#xD;
I can do it! Not only will I dispense with&#xD;
a new toilet for Mrs. Hautaine's party, but&#xD;
I will not order a single new dress this sea-&#xD;
son. I can do very well with what ~&#xD;
"My dear, you are talking nonsense,"&#xD;
interposed her father, coldly.&#xD;
"Why so, papal You think I am incapa-&#xD;
ble of acquiring the art of economy: I want&#xD;
to convince you to the contrary. I have&#xD;
been very thoughtless, very inconsiderate-&#xD;
even selfish, I fear-not to have remembered&#xD;
that it was impossible you should not have&#xD;
some difficulty about money at such a time&#xD;
as this. Now, that I am aware-why,&#xD;
papa, what is the matter? What have I&#xD;
said to displease you?"&#xD;
The question was a pertinent one. Gen-&#xD;
eral Aylmer was looking very much dis-&#xD;
pleased, and also not a little embarrassed.&#xD;
"You are talking nonsense, as I told you&#xD;
a minute ago. Like a woman-or like a&#xD;
child, rather-to the utter disregard of all&#xD;
common-sense. Keep to the subject under&#xD;
discussion, if you please. The question is not&#xD;
of future economy, but of impending ruin.~~&#xD;
Her attempts at consolation having been&#xD;
so ill received thus far, Valerie did not at&#xD;
first hazard a response, but waited for her&#xD;
father to proceed. This he did not seem in-&#xD;
clined to do; and, after a silence of some&#xD;
minutes, it was she who spoke again.&#xD;
"Surely," she said, a little hesitatbigly&#xD;
-" surely grandpapa does not mean to leave&#xD;
the whole of his fortune to his nephew. I&#xD;
should think he would give us something,&#xD;
papa-enough to pay this debt, perhaps."&#xD;
General Aylmer drew a deep breath-a&#xD;
sigh of relief, Valerie thought, at the pros-&#xD;
pect suggested by her remark. Yet he an-&#xD;
swered, dryly enough:&#xD;
"Do not flatter yourself with any such&#xD;
expectation. I see but one way out of.the&#xD;
difficulty-and that, I am afraid, you will&#xD;
not be sensible enough to adopt."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I! Does it depend on. me?"&#xD;
"Entirely."&#xD;
"Then, you know, papa, that I would&#xD;
do any thing possible to relieve you from&#xD;
this burden. What is required of me?"&#xD;
"Did you not read that letter?"&#xD;
"Yes-part of it, that is. The first page."&#xD;
"Read the remainder" said General&#xD;
Aylmer, and, for the third time, he returned&#xD;
to his sentinel-like walk.&#xD;
Miss Aylmer endeavored to obey; but&#xD;
the twilight had deepened since her last at-&#xD;
tempt. She held the paper close before her&#xD;
face for several minutes, but finally shook&#xD;
her head, and suffered her hand to drop&#xD;
upon her knee, as she said: "It is too dark&#xD;
to decipher these hieroglyphics. Cannot&#xD;
you tell me what it is, papa?"&#xD;
"Your grandfather,, Frenchman-like,&#xD;
suggests that what he calls the conflicting&#xD;
claims of yourself and this nephew he has&#xD;
taken up, may be reconciled in the most sat-&#xD;
isfactory manner, by a family arrangement&#xD;
-that is, alliance. He has already been&#xD;
urging you to spend the winter in Baltimore,&#xD;
you know, and he now presses his request&#xD;
still more earnestly. This-what is the&#xD;
man's name I-this Darcy, is to be there;&#xD;
and M. Vacquant is sure that, with the op-&#xD;
portunity of familiar association, which a&#xD;
residence in the same house would afford,&#xD;
you could not fail to be mutually attracted&#xD;
etc., etc."&#xD;
General Aylmer spoke with sneering&#xD;
sarcasm. Nevertheless, he waited anxious-&#xD;
ly to hear what his daughter would say to&#xD;
a proposal which might amuse, but which,&#xD;
he feared, would more probably excite her&#xD;
anger.&#xD;
"Well," he said, as she did not speak,&#xD;
"what do you think of this fine proposal of&#xD;
your grandfather's?"&#xD;
"That, if it came from any one else, I&#xD;
should resent it as an insult," she replied,&#xD;
in a tone so chilling that her father frowned&#xD;
-for he understood perfectly the nature&#xD;
with which he had to deal, and this did not&#xD;
look promising.&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks!" he said, impatiently.&#xD;
"The idea of your marrying this Irishman&#xD;
is quite absurd, I grant-but you can let&#xD;
your grandfather make that discovery him-&#xD;
&#xD;
self in due time. What he~ asks of you now&#xD;
is not a consent to the proposed 'alliance,'&#xD;
but merely that you will go to Baltimore&#xD;
and pay him a visit."&#xD;
She turned passionately.&#xD;
"Go to Baltimore! That is, accede to&#xD;
this insulting-yes, insulting proposal, to&#xD;
place myself on exhibition before-papa,&#xD;
you surely are not serious! You surely do&#xD;
not wish me to compromise my own dignity&#xD;
and yours, by doing such a thing!'~&#xD;
"I thought I said, distinctly, that the&#xD;
proposal itself is absurd," answered the gen-&#xD;
eral, coldly. "It is, however, preposterous&#xD;
to take the view you are adopting. Your&#xD;
grandfather means well; and I am sur-&#xD;
prised," he went on, gravely, "that you, who&#xD;
pique yourself on your French blood, should&#xD;
be so much opposed to the most ordinary&#xD;
of French customs. You are as inconsistent&#xD;
as the rest of your sex, I perceive."&#xD;
"I never professed to fancy mcsragee do&#xD;
oomvonance, sir-and I am sure I never in-&#xD;
tended to make one."&#xD;
"Who is talking of manages do eonee.&#xD;
nanco? Not your grandfather, certainly.&#xD;
He asks you to come and see if you can like&#xD;
this adventurer well enough to marry him;&#xD;
and I ask you-to temporize."&#xD;
"That is what you always say, papa."&#xD;
"I could not say any thing better in&#xD;
eleven cases out of twelve. Now, listen to&#xD;
me: you will do as you please, for I have&#xD;
no intention of placing a single fetter on&#xD;
your freedom of action. But if you do what&#xD;
is wise, you will go to Baltimore. Long&#xD;
absence has weakened your' inflilence over&#xD;
your grandfather; and it is desirable that&#xD;
this influence should be recovered at once, by&#xD;
personal intercourse. Is there any harm in&#xD;
looking after your own interest inthis way?"&#xD;
"There is the harm that it would make&#xD;
me feel like a scheming iatnigante."&#xD;
The general shrugged his shoulders&#xD;
scornfully. Such scruples and niceties&#xD;
seemed to him, as to most worldly-wise peo-&#xD;
ple, so absurd that he could scarcely believe&#xD;
in their sincerity.&#xD;
"You are very foolish, then-that is&#xD;
all! "he said, shortly. "The truth of the&#xD;
matter lies just the 'other way-for you&#xD;
would be going to protect your rights&#xD;

&#xD;
against the schen~es of another person.&#xD;
However, it is not worth while to argue the&#xD;
question. As I said before, you may go or&#xD;
not, as you choose. It is, not likely that&#xD;
much depends on it for yourself. , There i8&#xD;
a little wealth still left in our country here;&#xD;
and, with a word, you can marry the best&#xD;
fortune afloat. The rest of us-but that&#xD;
does not matter."&#xD;
The girl looked up quickly.&#xD;
"It is all that does matter," she said.&#xD;
"What about the rest of you I"&#xD;
"I thought I told you, a moment ago,&#xD;
that ruin is staring us in the face."&#xD;
"And I could prevent it?"&#xD;
"Your grandfather's fortune could pre-&#xD;
vent it, certainly."&#xD;
Valerie looked away again, absent and&#xD;
troubled. This last appeal had been quite a&#xD;
master-stroke of policy, and proved how&#xD;
well General Aylmer knew his daughter's&#xD;
character - a character th~t, with many&#xD;
faults, both natural and acquired, had yet&#xD;
enough of the heroic element to respond at&#xD;
once to that key-note of all noble natures,&#xD;
generosity. When she turned round again,&#xD;
it was quite abruptly.&#xD;
* "Papa" (a great gulp)-"papn-.-I will&#xD;
go to Baltimore."&#xD;
The general started. lIe had expected&#xD;
the concession, but not so soon, or with so&#xD;
little trouble.&#xD;
"You will go to Baltimore? '~' he repeat-&#xD;
ed, as if he did not quite trust the evidence&#xD;
of his own hearing.&#xD;
"Yes," said Valerie, swallowing some-&#xD;
thing in her throat, and speaking hastily but&#xD;
firmly, "I will go to Baltimore. But you&#xD;
know, of course, that I don't mean any&#xD;
thing of this-this sort "-she touched the&#xD;
letter., "I will go because you assure me&#xD;
that I can do good by going. But if grand-&#xD;
papa thinks that I entertain for a moment&#xD;
the proposal he has made, you must unde-&#xD;
ceive him."&#xD;
"But hold a moment? If you go, you&#xD;
must make up your mind not to irritate him&#xD;
by injudicious opposition to his scheme;&#xD;
but simply to suffer matters to take their&#xD;
course..&#xD;
"He must be told that I cannot consent&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes--but not told in an offensive man-&#xD;
ner. Leave that to me; and do you avoid&#xD;
the subject as entirely as possible. Mind,&#xD;
I don't counsel any thing like deception-&#xD;
only reticence.~~&#xD;
"Reticence is deception sometimes~ pa-&#xD;
pa."&#xD;
The general shrugged his shoulders again.&#xD;
He always did shrug them over moralities&#xD;
of this kind.&#xD;
"You have yet to learn that there is no&#xD;
wiser maxim in the world than Quieta non&#xD;
movere," he said. "You are young, how-&#xD;
ever. You will learn it in time, if you are&#xD;
sensible. Meanwhile, I consider the fact of&#xD;
the visit settled; and I am glad to be able&#xD;
"Don't praise or thank me, please,~~&#xD;
said his daughter, who seemed to know&#xD;
what was coming. She rose hastily from&#xD;
her seat, and descended the steps-then&#xD;
paused a moment, with her foot on the low-&#xD;
er one, and turned to speak.&#xD;
"Excuse my having interrupted you,&#xD;
papa, but I don't feel as if I deserved either&#xD;
praise or thanks. I make this sacrifice so&#xD;
i~nwillingly, that it cannot be counted to&#xD;
my credit. I hate it bitterly, and I am no&#xD;
more reconciled to the necessity now than&#xD;
when you spoke first. I tell you this, that&#xD;
you may perhaps overlook the ungracious&#xD;
manner in which it has been done."&#xD;
With the last words, and before her fa-&#xD;
ther had time to reply, she gave her pretty&#xD;
musical whistle for Sprite, and, attended by&#xD;
this satellite, walked away across the lawn.&#xD;
General Aylmer stood watching her, until&#xD;
the misty outline of her white dress van-&#xD;
ished in the soft purple dusk. Then he&#xD;
turned and entered the house, whistling soft-&#xD;
ly to himself, in a way he had when he was&#xD;
particularly well pleased.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
A SON OF NEPTUNE.&#xD;
As for Miss Aylmer, she bore away with&#xD;
her into the sweet gloaming as restless and&#xD;
disquieted a heart as it has often pleased&#xD;
our poor humanity to render itself uncom-&#xD;
&#xD;
portable with. In all her life, she had rare-&#xD;
ly, if ever, felt more angrily stirred than by&#xD;
the scene just passed-rarely, if ever, been&#xD;
called upon to place so great a constraint&#xD;
upon her own wishes and inclinations as she&#xD;
had just agreed to do. And, as she told her&#xD;
father, she did not accept the necessity at&#xD;
all gracefully; indeed, she rebelled against&#xD;
it with all her might, even while she volun-&#xD;
tarily bent her neck to endure it. Sacrifice,&#xD;
and the denial of her own will, were very&#xD;
fiew to her, and not at all pleasant. But&#xD;
still more new, still less pleasant, was the&#xD;
sense of positive insult tingling in every&#xD;
vein, as she realized the proposal her grand-&#xD;
father had made, and set her teeth and&#xD;
clinched her hands over it. "That he should&#xD;
think I would do such a thing!" she&#xD;
thought-and she was so indignant, that&#xD;
she felt her pulses beating with a rush, as&#xD;
she thought it. The longer she considered&#xD;
the proposition, the mora inexcusable it&#xD;
seemed, and the more she felt inclined to&#xD;
regret having struck her flag even as far as&#xD;
was implied in the consent to go to Balti-&#xD;
more. She was so strongly tempted to re-&#xD;
scind this resolution, that it required a very&#xD;
earnest consideration of all her father had&#xD;
told her, concerning his pecuniary difficul-&#xD;
ties, before she could entirely put aside the&#xD;
temptation, and resign herself to the ~inevi-&#xD;
table. "If I must, I must," she said, half&#xD;
aloud-and then she stopped short, for she&#xD;
found that she had walked much faster, and&#xD;
much farther, than she intended, and had&#xD;
reached the extremity of the grounds on that&#xD;
side.&#xD;
She stopped, and, as she stopped, she&#xD;
looked around. She had been so entirely,&#xD;
occupied with indignant thoughts, that she&#xD;
had not noticed how much the dusk had&#xD;
deepened, or that one by one the silver&#xD;
stars had gleamed into sight. The atmos-&#xD;
phere was heavy with fragrance, for an ar-&#xD;
bor covered by luxuriant creepers stood&#xD;
near; and where the shrubbery ended, and&#xD;
the outside domain began, there ran a&#xD;
hedge of orange and laurel; the air was so&#xD;
exquisitely clear, that, even through the&#xD;
shades -of evening, the fair picture of level&#xD;
fields, and distant, shadowy woodlands, was&#xD;
yet distinctly visible; and the low, far-off&#xD;
&#xD;
coo of the wood-pigeon was the only sound&#xD;
that broke the absolute stillness. A scene&#xD;
ore suggestive of repose could scarcely be&#xD;
conceived, and it was not without effect on&#xD;
the girl who gazed. She stood for some&#xD;
time where she had paused first, quite mo-&#xD;
tionless, with the flush gradually fading from&#xD;
her face, and the excitement dying down in&#xD;
her breast. She began to feel ashamed to&#xD;
remember how angry she had been-and all&#xD;
for what now seemed a very trifling cause!&#xD;
There was something of sanctuary quiet,&#xD;
something of sanctuary awe, in the subdued&#xD;
beauty, the deep, serene pathos-for when&#xD;
Nature is peaceful, she is always pathetic-&#xD;
of this twilight hour; and there came over&#xD;
her that hush of rest which only the sanc-&#xD;
tuary or Nature can bestow. She raised&#xD;
her face to the deep, steel-blue of the heav-&#xD;
ens, that looked down with glittering eyes&#xD;
upon her, and it seemed to shed peace, like&#xD;
a soft dew-peace that fell on her with the&#xD;
same subtle influence which had already&#xD;
touched the trees and the flowers, the&#xD;
broad plains, and the deep, shadowy woods,&#xD;
toning her spirit into unison with their&#xD;
repose. She was a girl not much habituated&#xD;
to serious moods-a girl who, at this period&#xD;
of her life, lived rather on the froth than&#xD;
in the depths of her own nature-but,&#xD;
just now, serious mood 1~ell on her, before&#xD;
she was well aware of what was coming.&#xD;
She sat down in the door of the arbor, and&#xD;
Sprite nestled close to her side, laying his&#xD;
little silken head on her knee, as the twi-&#xD;
light gathered deeper and deeper, wrapping&#xD;
them about, like a mantle.&#xD;
They had remained there for some time,&#xD;
and this friendly mantle cQncealed them&#xD;
effectually, when, after a while, there came&#xD;
a strain of music-very, sweet music, for&#xD;
a mellow whistle was executing deftly&#xD;
"Within a Mile of Edinboro' Town "-the&#xD;
click of a latch, as a gat&amp;amp; set in the hedge&#xD;
swung back, and a crisp, ringing ti~ead on&#xD;
the gravel-path. Through the dusk, the&#xD;
single, burning eye of a cigar glowed vividly&#xD;
into sight, and an odor of unexceptionally&#xD;
fragrant smoke came floating over the&#xD;
young lady, who drew back as if she desired&#xD;
to remained undiscovered. If such were the&#xD;
case, she reckoned without her host, how-&#xD;

14                        VALERIE AYLMER.                                                            A SON OF NEPTUNE.                        15&#xD;
&#xD;
ever, for Sprite, as it chanced, was of an-&#xD;
other mind. He gave a low growl, which&#xD;
changed suddenly into a whine of recogni-&#xD;
tion; and, before his mistress could inter.&#xD;
fere, had rushed forward, and was springing&#xD;
up on the approaching figure.&#xD;
"Why, Sprite 1" exclaimed a frank&#xD;
voice, "is it possible that this is you ?-are&#xD;
you out here by yourself; this time of night,&#xD;
you little rascal? I wonder what your mis-&#xD;
tress will say to you, sir? I should not be&#xD;
surprised if she was-. Why, where the&#xD;
deuce are you off to? Sprite! Here, sir!"&#xD;
Sprite, who had rushed back to Valerie,&#xD;
now rushed forward again, and was captured&#xD;
for his pains. He set up a cry of piteous&#xD;
lamentation, as he was tucked under his&#xD;
captor's arm, and this brought his mistress&#xD;
out of her retreat.&#xD;
"Stop, Oharley! " she cried, with a&#xD;
laugh. "Sprite is not out by himself-I am&#xD;
here. Put him down, please. I am afraid&#xD;
you are hurting him."&#xD;
"I am not hurting him in the least,"&#xD;
said the same voice that had spoken first-.&#xD;
but Sprite felt himself swung to the ground,&#xD;
nevertheless. "He is howling, like a spoiled&#xD;
ohild, purely by way of amusement. I was&#xD;
going to take him to you, as a sort of treas-&#xD;
ure-trove," he went on, approaching the&#xD;
young lady, who had paused on the arbor-&#xD;
steps.&#xD;
"Thank you-but you see it is not ne-&#xD;
cessary. He has not been lost."&#xD;
"Can his mistress say the same of her-&#xD;
self?"&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
~tOnly that you must surely have been&#xD;
lost or belated, or something of the kind, to&#xD;
b~ found in such a place as this, at such an&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
"What is the matter with the place?"&#xD;
"It is very lonely."&#xD;
"And with the hour."&#xD;
"It is very late."&#xD;
And what then?&#xD;
"Well-nothing, then, excepting that I&#xD;
wonder y~u are not afraid."&#xD;
"Afraid of what? Ghosts, snakes, or&#xD;
waiidering sailors?"&#xD;
"Nat the last, certainly," said the in-&#xD;
visible gentleman, who loomed up, in the&#xD;
&#xD;
* starlit dusk, like a dark, indistinct outline-&#xD;
his burning eye, that is, the cigar, having&#xD;
been thrown away when he heard Miss&#xD;
Aylmer's voice-" not the last, certainly;&#xD;
for the cause of fear would need to be on&#xD;
the other side in-"&#xD;
"Pshaw!" said the young lady, inter-&#xD;
rupting him unceremoniously. "Do you&#xD;
think I care for such a threadbare compli-&#xD;
ment, Oharley? If you could only correct that&#xD;
habit of paying compliments-such high-&#xD;
flown, foolish compliments, too !--it would&#xD;
improve you so much," she added, candidly.&#xD;
"You are breaking me of it, by degrees,"&#xD;
answered he; "but it -18 a habit, you know,&#xD;
and one of very long standing."&#xD;
"I can't see the sense of it," said Miss&#xD;
Aylmer, meditatively. "If you only deceived&#xD;
anybody now-but you know you don't. 1&#xD;
am confident that there is no woman alive&#xD;
silly enough to believe such nonsense as you&#xD;
were about to utter a minute ago."&#xD;
"Speak for yourself;" retorted he, with&#xD;
a laugh. "The majority of women like it&#xD;
exceedingly, and believe it unhesitatingly.&#xD;
Singularly enough, when it is flattery, they&#xD;
accept it undoubtingly; and it is only when&#xD;
it is truth that they distrust, as you are&#xD;
doing now."&#xD;
"Charley, you are incorrigible!"&#xD;
"Am I? Well, think so, if you like.&#xD;
Now tell me how you came to be out here,&#xD;
You must have been very much abstracted&#xD;
to have wandered so far."&#xD;
"No: I was very angry.~~&#xD;
"You!"&#xD;
Trust a lover for expressing himself&#xD;
well. A hundred panegyrics on her mani-&#xD;
fold charms could not have brought so for-&#xD;
cibly to Valerie's appreciation 'the supreme&#xD;
height to which this brave heart's devotion&#xD;
ha4 raised her, as did that one simple mono-&#xD;
syllable. She flushed brightly under color of&#xD;
the darkness-then answered, with a laugh:&#xD;
"Yes-I! I hope you don't overrate&#xD;
me so much as to think me amiable? You&#xD;
should know better."&#xD;
"I think you all things fair and noble,'~&#xD;
the young man replied, with such a soften-&#xD;
ing in his tones, that this time Miss Aylmer&#xD;
did not think it necessary to call him to ac-&#xD;
count. for a compliment.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then indeed you do overrate me very&#xD;
much," she said, quickly. "I am very im-&#xD;
patient, very wilful, and, a little while ago,&#xD;
I was very&#xD;
"For that matter, I would not give a&#xD;
farthing for anybody who could not, under&#xD;
just provocation, be very angry-and I am&#xD;
sure you had just provocation."&#xD;
"I thought so, undoubtedly. But then,&#xD;
when we want to be angry, don't we always&#xD;
think so?"'&#xD;
"Reasonable people do not so deceive&#xD;
themselves. And you are reasonable, are&#xD;
you not?"&#xD;
"I hope so. How is it with yourself?&#xD;
But then I forgot-you are never angry."&#xD;
"No," he replied, with candor. "I&#xD;
am afraid I must acknowledge myself as&#xD;
belQnging to my own class of weak-minded&#xD;
people-for I really think I am incapable of&#xD;
becoming very angry. At least I never,&#xD;
to my knowledge, have been so-." He&#xD;
stopped suddenly, and added - "that is,&#xD;
never but once."&#xD;
"But once? What a pity to spoil such an&#xD;
angelic whole by one exception! And how&#xD;
did you take the unusual occurrence, on&#xD;
that occasion?"&#xD;
He shuddered, and answered in a tone&#xD;
very different from her jesting one:&#xD;
"I can scarcely endure to think of it!&#xD;
It is like looking back on some paroxysm of&#xD;
madness-somewhat, as I imagine, a mind&#xD;
that is deranged must feel in lucid intervals.&#xD;
A sort of devil seemed to take possession of&#xD;
me for a time-and in that time murder&#xD;
would have been as easy a thing to me as&#xD;
now to lift my hand and break off this&#xD;
flower."&#xD;
There was a moment's pause, disturbed&#xD;
only by the snap with which he decapitated&#xD;
one of the slender stems clambering near&#xD;
him of its crowning blossom. Then he went&#xD;
on:&#xD;
"Ever since that revelation, I have been&#xD;
afraid of myself. It was such a terrible&#xD;
thing! I was no more myself-no more&#xD;
capable of controlling my passions when&#xD;
that raging fiend entered into me-than the&#xD;
madman who is put in a strait-jacket un-&#xD;
der lock and key."&#xD;
"How very strange!" said Valerie, the&#xD;
&#xD;
more interested, as the speaker's tones had&#xD;
deepened into positive agitation. "How&#xD;
long ago was it that you made this dis-&#xD;
covery?"&#xD;
"Several years-in fact, it was just be-&#xD;
fore the war."&#xD;
"About the time of your last cruise in&#xD;
the Mediterranean?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And-" She paused a moment, in&#xD;
doubt as to the propriety of the next ques-&#xD;
tion-but curiosity overcame her scruples.&#xD;
"And did you do any thing very dreadful&#xD;
under that influence?"&#xD;
"I did something which I shall never&#xD;
cease to regret until I cease to live." There&#xD;
was a silence of several minutes after that re-&#xD;
ply. There was such a tone of agony in his&#xD;
voice, that Valerie felt 8orry for having&#xD;
started the subject, and also, for once, rather&#xD;
uncertain what to say next, until she sud-&#xD;
denly bethought herself that, all things con-&#xD;
sidered, this starlight t4te-d-&amp;amp;ite was not the&#xD;
most "proper" thing in the world. With&#xD;
her accustomed promptitude she at once&#xD;
acted on the recollection.&#xD;
"Dear me!" she said, with a start;&#xD;
"What will papa think of me? It must be&#xD;
long past tea-time, and here I am a quarter&#xD;
of a mile at least from the house! I hope&#xD;
you are not very hungry, Oharley-for I&#xD;
really did not mean to entertain you on rose-&#xD;
petals."&#xD;
"Pray don't allow any consideration for&#xD;
my appetite to drive you away," the young&#xD;
man laughingly replied. "I am satisfied to&#xD;
go supperless, provided you will bear me&#xD;
company."&#xD;
"I am afraid papa would object," Miss&#xD;
Aylmer answered, as she descended the&#xD;
steps, and turned toward the house. "He&#xD;
is in need of somebody to pour out his cof-&#xD;
fee, you know. It must be growing cold,&#xD;
by-the-by; and I am confider~t he has sent&#xD;
two or three messengers for me. Yonder!&#xD;
is not that one now?"&#xD;
"I think it is my friend Mark Antony,&#xD;
whom I surprised in the humane occupation&#xD;
of 4rowning a kitten in your fountain, this'&#xD;
morning," her companion replied, as a small&#xD;
black figure ran up to them, and paused&#xD;
breathlessly.&#xD;

"Miss Valerie-" puff-" massa says "&#xD;

"supper for you, ma~am~ puff, puff!&#xD;
"Go hack and tell him I am coming,"&#xD;
the young ladycoolly replied; "and that Mr.&#xD;
Hautaine is coming also.-You ought to be&#xD;
obliged to me for that piece of information,"&#xD;
she said to Mr. Hautaine, as the sable mes-&#xD;
senger sped back again, with an utter disre-&#xD;
gard of his insolvent condition in the mat-&#xD;
ter of breath. "It will give papa time to&#xD;
order up a bottle of some fine champagne&#xD;
which he received only this afternoon. He&#xD;
says it is a pleasure to offer you good wine;&#xD;
you are such' a capital judge of vintages and&#xD;
flavors, and the like."&#xD;
"Yes,"~ said he, with something of a&#xD;
sigh; "I wish I had bestowed half the cul-&#xD;
ture on my head that I gave to my palate,&#xD;
~nd then I might be able to talk German&#xD;
mysticism and French sentiment, to quote&#xD;
Goethe and Lamartine, and Jean Paul, and&#xD;
the rest of that ilk, as well as your priggish&#xD;
friend Morton."&#xD;
"I'll thank you not to call him my&#xD;
friend," said Miss Aylmer, stiffly. "You&#xD;
know I don't like him!"&#xD;
"I never did you so much injustice as to&#xD;
suppose you liked him-but you like the&#xD;
same sort of things' that he likes."&#xD;
"I really don't see that."&#xD;
"Don't you? Well, I do. Heaven only&#xD;
knows where he got his learning-out of&#xD;
hand-books of literature, and dictionaries of&#xD;
quotation, I am inclined to think-but at&#xD;
least he seems to amuse you moderately&#xD;
well'; and that is more than I always, or&#xD;
often, accomplish."&#xD;
"Charley, you. are absurd! "~ said Miss&#xD;
Aylmer, half-amusedhalf-indignant. "You&#xD;
know I only tolerate him. Re is a prig,&#xD;
and a detestable one-and, I give you my&#xD;
word, I hate even Raphael, and Mozart; and&#xD;
Dante, when I hear him talk 'of them!*&#xD;
A ~ropos de rien, where is Mark Boyd? I&#xD;
did not meet him at Mrs. Lysle's last night&#xD;
-didl?"&#xD;
"I think not-since he went down to&#xD;
the city some days ago. He'll he hack, how-&#xD;
ever, before you leave for Arkansas-or, if&#xD;
ijot, he will soon follow you there."&#xD;
"Re will not find me, then," said Miss&#xD;
&#xD;
Aylmer, with malicious coolness. "I shall&#xD;
indeed leave soon, but it will be for-Balti-&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"Baltimore!" The exclamation was a&#xD;
violent one. There followed a moment's&#xD;
pause, and then-" You are surely jesting?"&#xD;
"Jesting! Why should you think so?&#xD;
Grandpapa lives in Baltimore, you know.&#xD;
Is there any thing strange in my going to&#xD;
see him?"&#xD;
"No-of course not," said Mr. Ilautaine,&#xD;
who had now somewhat recovered himself.&#xD;
"Only it was a surprise, and therefore-&#xD;
last night, you know, we were making&#xD;
plans for our month on Red River."&#xD;
"YesI know. But last night is not-&#xD;
to-night! A profound truth, which means&#xD;
that, since I was making those plans, circum-&#xD;
stances have arisen-that is, come to my&#xD;
knowledge-which will bear me off on the&#xD;
wings of discontent to Baltimore."&#xD;
"Then you don't wish to go?"&#xD;
"Ask meif I wish to put my hand in the&#xD;
fire," she replied, with rn-restrained bitter-&#xD;
ness. "I might, under some circumstances,&#xD;
tell you that it was necessary, but I could&#xD;
never tell you that I wished to do so."&#xD;
"Then," said the astonished gentleman,&#xD;
"why do you go?"&#xD;
"Because - I must," she answered.&#xD;
"Lookj There is poor papa in the dining-&#xD;
room all alone, waiting patiently for his&#xD;
truant daughter. Come in, Oharley. Per-&#xD;
haps the sight of you will console' him.&#xD;
Gerald is not at home to-night-I should not&#xD;
have forgotten to say so, for I suppose, of&#xD;
course, you came to see&#xD;
"Of course," said Mr. Ilautaine, dryly.&#xD;
Then he drew back the sweeping folds of&#xD;
the lace curtain, that the night breeze was&#xD;
gently swaying to and fro, and held it on&#xD;
one.' side, while his companion stepped&#xD;
through a French window into the dining-&#xD;
room, where a tea-table all glittering with&#xD;
silver and china stood, and where General&#xD;
Aylmer was solacing himself with a n~ws-&#xD;
paper during his period of enforced walt-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
PUTTING IT TO THH TOUcH.&#xD;
"1'aAv, Charley, put that guitar down.&#xD;
I have a question to ask you; and one can't&#xD;
talk with thrum-thrum in one s ears all the&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"To hear is to obey," said Charley; and&#xD;
he submissively laid the guitar down at the&#xD;
feet of his fair mistress, and looked up into&#xD;
her face.&#xD;
They made a very pretty picture, as they&#xD;
sat at one end of the large~ drawing-room,&#xD;
for it was two or three hours after supper,&#xD;
and General Aylmer had taken himself off&#xD;
some time before-not out of consideration,&#xD;
as might perhaps be supposed, but simply&#xD;
because he would as soon have considered&#xD;
one of his own sons "company," as Chariey&#xD;
Hautaine, who was the daily visitor of the&#xD;
house, and had been the intimate companion&#xD;
of his children ever since they knew what&#xD;
it was to have a companion. So, he had&#xD;
taken himself off, and the two young people&#xD;
had been singing duets to a guitar accom-&#xD;
paniment for a while, and then had been&#xD;
talking gay nonsense while Charley still ran&#xD;
his fingers over the strings, until Valerie&#xD;
suddenly broke in with the words recorded&#xD;
above. As already stated, her vassal obeyed&#xD;
at once. He laid the guitar down, and&#xD;
looked up for her next commands. She&#xD;
paused a moment-.~.and jnst then the pic-&#xD;
ture was prettier than ever. Miss Aylmer,&#xD;
who was at all times fond of assuming atti-&#xD;
tudes which were out of the routine of&#xD;
social habit, was nestling among a pile of&#xD;
cushions placed immediately beside one of&#xD;
the open windows; and the POSS of careless&#xD;
languor was also one of inimitable grace,&#xD;
while every waving outline of her figure&#xD;
was thrown into strong relief by the dark&#xD;
cushions against which she leaned. Her&#xD;
late emotion, or, perhaps, her late exercise,&#xD;
had given to her cheek the rich pomegran-&#xD;
ate flush peculiar to it-the proud scarlet&#xD;
lips, always so mutiny and lovely, now wore&#xD;
their most enchanting smile-the dark eyes&#xD;
were all aglow with a thousand varying&#xD;
lights and shadows-.-and, in short, it was&#xD;
'evident that ta leZlo dee befl~s (as the cap-&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
tives of her bow and spear had long since&#xD;
styled her) meant business, and was play-&#xD;
ing wild havoc with the heart of her at-&#xD;
tendant cavalier.&#xD;
That this attendant cavalier was very&#xD;
"hard hit" was a matter not in the least&#xD;
open to doubt; indeed, it was a matter of'&#xD;
such long standing that nobody in St.&#xD;
Stephen's Parish ever thought of doubting&#xD;
it. Everybody took it for 'granted that&#xD;
Valerie would end by marrying the hand-&#xD;
some young sailor, who had been in love&#xD;
with her ever since he was in round-jackets&#xD;
and she in bib-aprons, and everybody was&#xD;
ready to cordially indorse her conduct when-&#xD;
ever she did 'so. Nothing could possibly be&#xD;
more suitable, people said. They were of&#xD;
equal social position, both heirs-presump-&#xD;
tive to more than moderate fortunes, both as&#xD;
charming and handsome as possible, and the&#xD;
gentleman, at least, so much in love that&#xD;
he made no pretext of concealing the fact.&#xD;
What more 'could any reasonable woman&#xD;
desire? According to the inference, Miss&#xD;
Aylmer was not a reasonable woman, for,&#xD;
Up to this time, she had evinced no inten-&#xD;
tion of surrendering her pleasant freedom;&#xD;
and, although she treated her sworn retainer&#xD;
with a kindness and cordiality only a shade&#xD;
different from that with which she treated&#xD;
her own brothers, she, nevertheless, fenced&#xD;
off any demonstrations of serious devotion&#xD;
very cleverly, and kept him at a distance&#xD;
as entirely as she kept many others. It&#xD;
somewhat puzzled his friends and acquaint-&#xD;
ances to imagine why Rautaine, who a good&#xD;
deal resembled young Lochinvar in the item&#xD;
of impetuosity, and had always shared the&#xD;
latter's cordial scorn for "a laggard in love,"&#xD;
submitted to this capricious tyranny so&#xD;
quietly; and yet the reason was very sim-~&#xD;
ple. The young man was seriously an4&#xD;
passionately in love-so much in love that&#xD;
diffidence of himself, and distrust of his own&#xD;
powers, had come to him fo~ almost' the first&#xD;
time in his life, and made him heait~ite, as&#xD;
better men had hesitated before him, to put&#xD;
his fate to its crowning touch. Perhaps he'&#xD;
felt, too, that this suspense, this uncertainty,.&#xD;
was, after all, only a kind of tar trdionis for~&#xD;
his past trifling with other and more sus-~&#xD;
ceptible hearts than his own weather-beaten&#xD;

PUTTING IT TO THE TOUCH.&#xD;

&#xD;
organ; for it was not to be denied that he&#xD;
had done more mischief in that line than&#xD;
lies~atthe door of most of his lady-killing&#xD;
profession. lie was clever, high-spirited,&#xD;
brave to a fault, thorough-bred within and&#xD;
without, and handsome as a prince in a&#xD;
fairy tale; so nobody wondered at this, or&#xD;
took the responsibility of blaming him-not&#xD;
even the girls with whom he flirted, or the&#xD;
men whom he rivalled. Indeed, nothing&#xD;
proved his complete distinction from that&#xD;
contemptible species styled the "male flirt"&#xD;
more than the warm and cordial liking which&#xD;
people of all ages and all sexes gave to him.&#xD;
* The macst spiteful never found sny thing&#xD;
worse to say than that 'he was a spoiled&#xD;
puppy, while his many intimates were&#xD;
ready to swear by him as the most delight-&#xD;
ful of companions, and fastest of friends;&#xD;
and no one could show a better war record&#xD;
~than this young sybarite of idlesse and&#xD;
luxury. He had not been long at home, nor&#xD;
did he propose remaining there. The only&#xD;
charm which now. held him in America&#xD;
was, his love for Valerie Aylmer. Whether&#xD;
or not this charm would long continue to&#xD;
hold him, was a question yet unanswered;&#xD;
but, if Miss Aylmer had, taken the vote of all&#xD;
her friends on the subject of his suit, she&#xD;
would have found their verdict singularly&#xD;
unanimous on the point that she "would&#xD;
never do better than to take him." Per-&#xD;
haps this was true; for there was about&#xD;
Oharley Hautaine the best of all assurances&#xD;
that his youthful follies were only the sur-&#xD;
face froth that would pass away and leave,&#xD;
after a while, pure wine; the assurance, with-&#xD;
out which it is vain to hope for any young&#xD;
man's reform, and 'with which hope need&#xD;
never die-he was emphatically a gentle-&#xD;
man !-gentleman, in that nameless~ refine-&#xD;
ment which no self-culture can ever give,&#xD;
but which comes alone of birth nud breed-&#xD;
ing-gentleman, in the, chivalric impulses&#xD;
and instinct which made the mere shadow&#xD;
of dishonor an impossible thing-gentle-&#xD;
man, 'in all that touched the knightly creed&#xD;
of his race and his land-else, verily, he&#xD;
had~ never won a single approving glance&#xD;
from Valerie Aylmer's dark eyes, or merit-&#xD;
eda word of'this already too prolix descrip-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
&#xD;
He was redlining his well-formed figure,&#xD;
in an attitude not without grace, at her&#xD;
feet, and still gazing into her face, when&#xD;
at last Miss Ayhner spoke abruptly:&#xD;
"You have been in Florence, have you&#xD;
not, Charley?"&#xD;
The question was a very simple one,&#xD;
and by no means seemed' to warrant the&#xD;
quick start of surprise, and yet quicker&#xD;
change of color, with which her companion&#xD;
heard it. lie glanced up into her face, with&#xD;
a half-furtive scrutiny, as if searching there&#xD;
for a hidden motive in the words; but the&#xD;
frank, open ga±e he met seemed to reassure&#xD;
him, for his brow cleared of its momentary&#xD;
cloud as he answered, readily enough:&#xD;
"In' Florence? I have been there, yes&#xD;
-but not very often; only once or twice,&#xD;
in fact. Why do you ask?"&#xD;
"Nothing of much importance. I was&#xD;
only going to inquire-but it is scarcely&#xD;
likely, since you were there seldom-if you&#xD;
ever met, or heard of, an Irish artist of some&#xD;
note, who formerly lived there, named&#xD;
Darcy."&#xD;
This time there was no mistaking the&#xD;
shock her words gave. Every vestige of col-&#xD;
or forsook Hautaine's face, at sound of the&#xD;
name which concluded her speech. The gui-&#xD;
tar dropped to the floor with a clang of&#xD;
its silver strings, and his eyes remained fast-&#xD;
ened on her in mute inquiry, that was not&#xD;
more startled than shocked.&#xD;
"What is the matter? " Valerie inquired,&#xD;
with very natural surprise. "Why do you&#xD;
look at me so strangely? Was there any&#xD;
thing remarkable about the man?"&#xD;
"About the man! Is it-is it possible&#xD;
you know him?"&#xD;
"Know him? Of course not !-indeed,&#xD;
it was a very absurd question, now that' I&#xD;
think of it: for I believe he has been dead&#xD;
for years."&#xD;
"Oh! you mean the fa-" he stopped&#xD;
short, seemed to remember, and collect him-&#xD;
self; for he added, more indifferently," I&#xD;
did know a man of that name, but not the&#xD;
one to whom you allude."&#xD;
"It might have been his son," said&#xD;
Valerie, with an interest which her com-&#xD;
panion thought very misplaced.&#xD;
"Perhaps so. Here !-see how well I&#xD;
&#xD;
have tuned this miserable 0 string! Now,&#xD;
will you sing O7ia~jri~i d'Amour?"&#xD;
"Not just now. I am in the humor for&#xD;
talking, I believe. Tell me something about&#xD;
this Mr. Darcy-what manner of man is&#xD;
he?"&#xD;
"I-really scarcely know how to de-&#xD;
scribe him. Portrait-painting is his trade&#xD;
-not mine. I used to lounge in his studio&#xD;
.-that's all."&#xD;
"He, too, is an artist then? A portrait-&#xD;
painter, you say?" She looked rather sur-&#xD;
prised.&#xD;
Hautaine gave a keen and not a little&#xD;
troubled glance at her face, before he said,&#xD;
slowly:&#xD;
"You seem very much interested about&#xD;
him!"&#xD;
"Oh, not at all!" She sank back into&#xD;
her cushions, and the face relapsed from&#xD;
animation into listlessness. "I only felt a&#xD;
slight curiosity, because he is-I believe-a&#xD;
connection of mine."&#xD;
"What! Darcy a connection of yours?"&#xD;
Miss Aylmer win6cd somewhat at the&#xD;
tone of this exclamation; then, after a&#xD;
pause, she spoke rather distantly: "Will&#xD;
you please be so kind as to tell me what&#xD;
you know of Mr. Darcy? As I said, he is a&#xD;
connection of mine, and this fact must ex~&#xD;
cause my curiosity to learmrwhat can possibly&#xD;
be so dreadful about him."&#xD;
"Dreadful!" said her companion, hur-&#xD;
riedly. "Excuse my repeating the word;&#xD;
but indeed I have expressed myself very&#xD;
badly, if any thing~ which I have said has&#xD;
conveyed an unfavorable opinion of him."&#xD;
"It is evident that you do not like him.&#xD;
Why?"&#xD;
"You are mistaken, I do; I mean I did,&#xD;
when I knew him, like him-" Hisvoice&#xD;
faltered, but he added, earnestly, "I never&#xD;
knew a man more perfectly 'unexception-&#xD;
able."&#xD;
"Then why did you consider it neces-&#xD;
sary to seem so much surprised-almost&#xD;
shocked-when I mentioned our relation-&#xD;
ship?"&#xD;
"Relationship? I thought you said it&#xD;
was only connection!"&#xD;
"Well, connection, What was there in&#xD;
that so startling?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Upon my word, you are a close ques-&#xD;
tioner," he said, forcing a smile. "I was&#xD;
surprised, because-well, because naturally&#xD;
I never had imagined connection between&#xD;
yourself and this Irish artist."&#xD;
Valerie bit her lip. Such is the weak-&#xD;
ness of human nature that, although a mo-&#xD;
ment before the truth concerning that close&#xD;
connection which existed between this un-&#xD;
known relative and the projected visit to&#xD;
Baltimore had trembled on her tongue, the&#xD;
tone which pronounced those last words-&#xD;
"this Irish artist "-effectually hushed them&#xD;
back into silence. When she spoke next, it&#xD;
was to say, quite indifferently:&#xD;
"Do you know that he served in our&#xD;
army during the war?"&#xD;
"No; but I am not surprised to hear it."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
"Because-" he hesitated a moment-&#xD;
"because it is what I would have expected&#xD;
of him."&#xD;
"Why? Excuse my persistence, but a&#xD;
fighting artist is something so entirely&#xD;
unique that one cannot help feeling a little&#xD;
curious about such a rara avi8. Why did&#xD;
you expect it of him?"&#xD;
"Because if he had not been an artist I&#xD;
am sure he would have been a soldier; and,&#xD;
as it was, he had quite as much' stildier as&#xD;
artist about him. Is that enough?"&#xD;
"It is enough to stimulate my appetite&#xD;
for more, if that is what you mean. Es he&#xD;
young?"&#xD;
"Not very."&#xD;
"Handsome?"&#xD;
"I-really don't remember. Moderate-&#xD;
ly good-looking, I believe. I would have&#xD;
paid more attention to him," he went on,&#xD;
with another forced smile, "if I could have&#xD;
foreseen your interest."&#xD;
"I hav'e no interest, only a little curios-&#xD;
Thy," said Miss Aylmer, somewhat piqued.&#xD;
Then she rose and sauntere~l toward the&#xD;
piano.&#xD;
"Bring the guitar with you," she said&#xD;
to Hautaine, who had risen eagerly to fol-&#xD;
low. "We will try that duet from 'Rigo-&#xD;
letto' once more, since we are not likely&#xD;
to have many more opportunities to do so."&#xD;
"I think this is at least the third time,&#xD;
since supper, that you have made that in-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
spiriting ren~ark," said the gentleman, doing&#xD;
as he was bid, coming forward with the&#xD;
azure ribbons of the instrument slung across&#xD;
his shoulder, as if he had been troubadour.&#xD;
"Pray, how do you intend to dispose of&#xD;
yourself in Baltimore, that you think it ne-&#xD;
cessary t9 adopt such a farewell tone?"&#xD;
"One naturally looks forward to a dis-&#xD;
agreeable thing as a very long one," she an-&#xD;
swered. "I am sure you ought to sympa-&#xD;
thize with me, for you remember the pas-&#xD;
asge you are so fond of quoting from&#xD;
Buiwer-' A chord, stronger orweaker, is&#xD;
snapped~ asunder at every parting, and&#xD;
Time's busy fingers are not practiced in re-&#xD;
splicing broken tics?'"&#xD;
"I remember," the young man said,&#xD;
quite gravely, as he unslung the guitar from&#xD;
over his shoulder, and laid it down across&#xD;
the piano-" I remember-and, if indeed&#xD;
'eternity itself cannot restore the loss struck&#xD;
froixi the minute, 'imagine what I feel, when&#xD;
I see slipping from me now moments so gold-&#xD;
en that I dare not hope they cau ever be&#xD;
restored or repeated."&#xD;
"I am sure I'm much obliged to you,"&#xD;
Miss Alymer returned, laughingly. "Your&#xD;
misgivings are certainly complimentary!&#xD;
])o you think I will grow so dreadfully old&#xD;
and ugly, in a few months, that I cen never&#xD;
again make an hour golden by the light of&#xD;
myeyes?"&#xD;
"No," he answered, reproachfully. "You&#xD;
know I do not think so! I only think-I&#xD;
only feel-that for me all may be changed&#xD;
when we meet again. It would be heresy&#xD;
to doubt that your eyes wrn be as bright,&#xD;
and your smile as sweet, as now; but yet,&#xD;
all the same, they may have lost their sun-&#xD;
shine.&#xD;
'If they be not fair to me,&#xD;
What care I how fair they be?' '~&#xD;
"I suppose you mean that you will&#xD;
have transferred your wandering devotion&#xD;
to some worthier shrine, by that time-"&#xD;
said Valerie, maliciously. "IV'importe! per-.&#xD;
haps I may be able to console myself; even&#xD;
for such a desertion?"&#xD;
"You seem wilfully determined to mis-&#xD;
understand me," her companion answered,&#xD;
looking down into her laughing eyes with&#xD;
a serious gravity that made Mademoiselle&#xD;
&#xD;
I'UT2~ING IT TO TEIE TOUCH.                      21&#xD;
&#xD;
Valerie feel rather uncomfortable-as if a&#xD;
crisis was at hand, and the helm had some-&#xD;
how slipped out of her dexterous grasp.&#xD;
She made one bold effort to regain the man-&#xD;
agement of affairs, and, to do her justice,&#xD;
she was generally equal to any emergency&#xD;
that might arise in a matter of this kind.&#xD;
"Oh no," she answered, gayly, "I don't&#xD;
misunderstand you, I am sure; and I don't&#xD;
at all blame you. It is the most convenient&#xD;
philosophy in the world, that of the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of the hour, and one I always make a&#xD;
rule to practise. Vise la lja~gttelle! Life is&#xD;
too short tobe spentin remembering people,&#xD;
when they are not immediately in one's&#xD;
si~ht." And, turning round to the key-&#xD;
board before he could reply, her clear voice&#xD;
was ringing out.            /&#xD;
""Tis good to be merry and wise,&#xD;
Tis good to be honest and true:&#xD;
'Tis good to be off with the old love,&#xD;
Before you are on with the new."'&#xD;
"That is a~l very fine," said Mr. Han-&#xD;
tame, coolly; "but when one has no inten-&#xD;
tion either of being off with an old love or&#xD;
on with a new, I confess I don't perceive&#xD;
the application."&#xD;
"Qui 8 eXCU8C, 8 accuse! How do you&#xD;
know that I was not applying my song to&#xD;
myself?"&#xD;
"I would not do you such injustice."&#xD;
"Injustice! What do you mean I"&#xD;
"Only that a woman should never at&#xD;
least acknowledge more than one love..&#xD;
"She is most fortunate who acknowl-&#xD;
edges none," said Miss Alymer, throwing&#xD;
back her head. "Of all my favorite hero-&#xD;
ines, Beatrice stands chief-if only for the&#xD;
spirit that 'would rather have heard her&#xD;
dog bark at a crow, than a man swear he&#xD;
loved her."'&#xD;
"I will not pray, with Benedict, tha~t&#xD;
'God may keep your ladyship long in that&#xD;
mind,"' Ilautaine answered; "for, at pres-&#xD;
ent, I am rather bent on bringing your lady-&#xD;
ship out of that mind I In other words,&#xD;
you have stopped me a hundred times, when&#xD;
you knew as well as I did what I was go-&#xD;
ing to say. Now I defy you to prevent&#xD;
yourself from hcarin~ that I love yonl-&#xD;
Valerie, I love you! "&#xD;
Few words, but expressive-se expres-&#xD;
&#xD;
sive of a passion which she had not credited&#xD;
in this versatile, pleasure-loving nature, that&#xD;
Valerie actually started, as they fell on her&#xD;
ear. But she did not lift her eyes from the&#xD;
page of music she had taken up; and when&#xD;
a deep silence fell, in which she could al-&#xD;
most hear the quick throbbing of the heart&#xD;
whose pulses were beating beside her, she&#xD;
only said, in a half-careless, half-petulant&#xD;
tone:&#xD;
"Well-and what of that?"&#xD;
Hautaine turned suddenly, and looked&#xD;
down at her, in a sort of mute exasperation.&#xD;
She had been a puzzle to him, and a trial to&#xD;
him at all times; but never more either puz-&#xD;
zle or trial than as she sat before him now,&#xD;
the picture of cool nonchalance, with a mis-&#xD;
chievous light gleaming in the eyes that at&#xD;
last raised themselves to meet his own.&#xD;
"Well, what of that?" she repeated,&#xD;
lightly. "I hope you don't expect inc to&#xD;
feel overpowered by having drawn forth&#xD;
that novel observation? Tell me, candidly&#xD;
-as a matter of abstract curiosity, I should&#xD;
like to know-how much do you vary the&#xD;
formula of that speech with the dozens of&#xD;
applications you have already made of it in&#xD;
the past, and will make of it in the future?"&#xD;
"You are paying yourself even a poorer&#xD;
compliment than you pay me," said he, a&#xD;
little haughtily, "if you suppose that I have&#xD;
ever said to any other woman what I say to&#xD;
you when I tell you that I love you; but&#xD;
thenit is folly to tell you that, for you know&#xD;
it now, and have known it all the time.&#xD;
When I ask you, then, as earnestly as possi-&#xD;
ble, to consider the proposal which, in all&#xD;
solemn seriousness-"&#xD;
"Solemn seriousness? Why, we are&#xD;
growing terribly grave! And suppose I&#xD;
humbly beg leave to decline considering it&#xD;
at all?"&#xD;
"In that case," he answered, quietly,&#xD;
although his face paled at her words, "I&#xD;
can only regret to have pained myself-&#xD;
not you, fortunately-in an unnecessary&#xD;
manner; and bid yen good-evening."&#xD;
He bowed very low and very gracefully.&#xD;
Like all of his race, t'.ie spirit of the cheva-&#xD;
lier came to the surface, whenever any sud-&#xD;
den dart probed his nature to the quick.&#xD;
Then he turned toward the door. Now, this&#xD;
&#xD;
unexpected evacuation of the field was not&#xD;
at all what Miss Aylmer had either expected&#xD;
or desired. One moment she watched him&#xD;
in silent astonishment; the next, her power&#xD;
of speech returned, and with it her power&#xD;
of action.&#xD;
"Stop, Charley! - stop!" she cried,&#xD;
springing forward, and throwing down the&#xD;
music-stool with a crash that waked Sprite&#xD;
from a comfortable nap in the sofa-corner,&#xD;
and brought Hautaine to a halt at once. The&#xD;
next moment, her hand was on his arm,&#xD;
and voice and glance together brought a&#xD;
battery to bear.&#xD;
"Oharley! You surely are not angry&#xD;
with mc?"&#xD;
Poor Charley I-it was all up with him&#xD;
then. He had not so effectually stopped his&#xD;
cars with injured feeling, for the tones of&#xD;
the siren not to penetrate the insufficient&#xD;
guard.&#xD;
"Angry with you!" he repeated, in a&#xD;
tone of mingled tenderness and reproach.&#xD;
"I do not know that I have ever been that,&#xD;
Valerie; although you have tried me right&#xD;
hardly, sometimes, and hardest of all to-&#xD;
night. At least, if I ever was, you know&#xD;
your own power too well to think that I&#xD;
could continue so."&#xD;
"Well, come back, then, like a sensible&#xD;
man, and don't let us have any more hero-&#xD;
ics," said she, leading the way again toward&#xD;
the piano. "Just look at that stool 1-and&#xD;
at poor dear little Sprite's eyes!-Never&#xD;
mind, pet, Mr. Hautaine has promised better&#xD;
behavior; and we won't be so impetuous&#xD;
any more."&#xD;
"Mr. Hautaine must make his own con-&#xD;
ditions, then," said that gentleman, as he&#xD;
lifted the recumbent stool to its proper p0-&#xD;
sition. "He has put his fate to the touch,&#xD;
and he means to have his answer to-night,&#xD;
come what will."&#xD;
"Let us interlude business with a little&#xD;
music," said Miss Aylrner, sinking down into&#xD;
a deep chair. "Please sing the .M'appari&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
"If I sing any thing at all, I think it had&#xD;
better be 'AA! ride del mio pianto,"' he&#xD;
answered, leaning against the instrument,&#xD;
but evidently with no intention oftouching&#xD;
it. "Sorry as I am to be disobliging, I&#xD;

VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;

ON THlE WING.&#xD;
&#xD;
must, however, decline to gratify you, until&#xD;
this matter of mine is disposed of."&#xD;
"Do you know that you are very much&#xD;
polledd? You are growing absolutely dic-&#xD;
tatorial."&#xD;
"If I am spoiled, your conscience cer-&#xD;
tainly need not reproach you with any&#xD;
share in the blame of it. And it is high&#xD;
time that I became a little dictatorial-if, by&#xD;
that, you mean considerate of my own self-&#xD;
respect."&#xD;
*        "You use strong words, sir!"&#xD;
"Strong words are the only exponents&#xD;
of strong feelings! I may be forced to use&#xD;
yet stronger ones before I again have the&#xD;
honor of saying good-night2'&#xD;
Miss Aylmer sat up in her chair-she&#xD;
had been lying indolently back before-and&#xD;
indulged in a stare at the flushed and reso-&#xD;
lute face looking at her.&#xD;
"Charley, I confess I don't understand&#xD;
you to-night; you don't seem at' all like&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
"So much the better," said Charley, with&#xD;
imperturbable composure. "Myself you&#xD;
have long known, and treated, I am sorry&#xD;
to say, with profound disregard. I now in-&#xD;
troduce to you a man whom you may con-&#xD;
sider worthy of a little more respectful at-&#xD;
tention."&#xD;
"And what does this new acquaintance&#xD;
who I am not sure I shall like half as&#xD;
well as the old one-expect of ~&#xD;
"He has no right to expect any thing.&#xD;
He only asks a return from your heart for&#xD;
the love of his."&#xD;
The tone of mingled dignity and feeling&#xD;
could not have failed to touch anywoman-&#xD;
and it sent a quick throb through Valerie's&#xD;
,     breast. She felt at once that trifling was at&#xD;
an end here, ~ud that she stood face to face&#xD;
with a crisis of her life-a crisis of the two&#xD;
lives whose future fate she held at that mo-&#xD;
ment in her ha~id. She looked up with a&#xD;
sudden strange gravity on her face, a hesi-&#xD;
tancy and regret in her voice.&#xD;
"Charley, I fear I cannot give him that."&#xD;
A profound silence followed those words&#xD;
--words so few and simple, yet which gave&#xD;
a sharp death-stab to the hope burning so&#xD;
brightly the moment before. Hautaine&#xD;
made no answer, for he could not trust his&#xD;
&#xD;
voice to speak, lest some rising weakness&#xD;
should betray him. He had -scarcely real-&#xD;
ized how infinitely dear to him this woman&#xD;
was, until her own lips withdrew her be-&#xD;
yond his reach; and a sudden darkness&#xD;
seemed to fall over all the things of life, in&#xD;
the certainty that her smile was gone from&#xD;
them forever'! He still stood looking down&#xD;
at her-but perfectly motionless, with only&#xD;
a slight twitching of his long, silken mus-&#xD;
tache, to indicate how strong was the feel.&#xD;
ing the manifestation of which he repressed.&#xD;
Valerie waited vainly for him to speak:&#xD;
waited until she grew almost frightened, at&#xD;
his unmoved quietude. Then she spoke her-&#xD;
self, very timidly:&#xD;
"Charley, do you really care for me-&#xD;
very much?"&#xD;
"I don't think I need to answer that&#xD;
question," he said, a little hoarsely.&#xD;
"No," she replied, quickly. "I know&#xD;
you do-now. But now is so very differ-&#xD;
ent from hereafter-with you, especially!&#xD;
Therefore, I am not sure that it would be&#xD;
right-"&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" he interrupted, pas-&#xD;
sionately. "If it can be that you hesitate&#xD;
to accept me, only because you doubt wheth-&#xD;
er my love for you is as far removed as the&#xD;
poles from my fancies for other women,&#xD;
don't hesitate for one moment to try me!&#xD;
Let the test be as long and as hard as you&#xD;
please! Only try me-only believe me!"&#xD;
Valerie flushed warmly. No woman&#xD;
could have heard those tones, and met the&#xD;
glance which accompanied them, unmoved,&#xD;
even if she had entertained no tenderness&#xD;
toward the speaker; far less when, as in&#xD;
the present instance, her warm and cordial&#xD;
liking for him stopped only just short of&#xD;
love-that love which the majority of the&#xD;
human race die without ever having knownn,&#xD;
and of which ten thousand counterfeits&#xD;
worse than this pass current in the world&#xD;
every day. She held out her hand,'with a&#xD;
grace all her own-as a queen might have&#xD;
extended it to some faithful knight who&#xD;
had done gallant battle in her service.&#xD;
"I do believe you, and thank you," she&#xD;
said simply, but with so gentle and alto-&#xD;
gether charming an accent, that tlantaine&#xD;
would have been something less than man&#xD;
&#xD;
it he had not raised that hand to his lips.&#xD;
But he knew his lady-love well enough not&#xD;
to release it at once then; for, with all her&#xD;
gay coquetries, no prude ever less allowed&#xD;
the shadow of a personal liberty than Miss&#xD;
Aylmer; nor was he so blind as to mistake&#xD;
that frank impulse of woman's gratitude&#xD;
for the shyer token of woman's love.&#xD;
"Now listen," she said, in her usual&#xD;
tone, "and see if you are ready to accede&#xD;
to my conditions, which, I warn you before-&#xD;
hand, are very unreasonable ones. You are&#xD;
mistaken in one thing: it is not you whom&#xD;
I distrust, but myself. I like you better-&#xD;
much better-than any one else I have ever&#xD;
seen; but I do not think I love you. I do&#xD;
not think so, but my ideas of that passion&#xD;
may be too exalted, and I may care for you&#xD;
as much as I am capable of caring for any-&#xD;
body. Now, there is only one way to&#xD;
solve the question. It is said that absence&#xD;
strengthens a real passion, and extinguishes&#xD;
a false one. What I propose, therefore, is&#xD;
to try absence."&#xD;
"On ~&#xD;
"No, on myself. Six months from to-&#xD;
day I shall be able to tell you whether my&#xD;
liking-my affection-for you, is only that&#xD;
which one entertains for a charming friend,&#xD;
or that which one should bear one's future&#xD;
lord and master! But it is for you to decide&#xD;
whether or not you will wait six months&#xD;
for the answer which you have a right to&#xD;
demand to-night."&#xD;
A vivid flash of hope and joy lit up the&#xD;
handsome face, and the hazel eyes were&#xD;
glowing and dazzling, as Hautaine bent low&#xD;
over the hand which this time he did not&#xD;
release, saying:&#xD;
"Six months or six years-if, at the&#xD;
end of that time, I can hope to claim this&#xD;
for 'my own!"&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
ON THE wi~a.&#xD;
IT was part of General Aylmer's world-&#xD;
ly-wise policy to be always prompt in ac-&#xD;
tion, especially with any one whose resolu-&#xD;
tion of any kind he had reason to doubt.&#xD;
&#xD;
If L -&#xD;
&#xD;
22&#xD;
&#xD;
,23&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, he had reason-or thought he had&#xD;
reason-for very seriously doubting his&#xD;
daughter's resolution in regard to the prom-&#xD;
ised visit to Baltimore; so he took care to&#xD;
give her no timefor vacillation or retreat.&#xD;
When she came down to breakfast on the&#xD;
morning after the decisive interview, he&#xD;
told her that ho had already written to M.&#xD;
Vacquant, announcing her coming, and that&#xD;
he hoped she would begin herpreparations&#xD;
at once. "I know, of course, that they will&#xD;
be tremendous," he said, with a shrug, "but&#xD;
you must try and be ready by the end of&#xD;
the month, Valerie. Iwant to start then."&#xD;
"So soon, papa? '~ said Valerie, naturally&#xD;
taken aback, and opening her eyes not a lit-&#xD;
tle. "Why, surely there is no hurry! If&#xD;
we reach Baltimore by Christmas, it will be&#xD;
time enough."&#xD;
"Hadn't you better say by spring?"&#xD;
asked her father, in an irritated tone. "If&#xD;
you are not going to do the thing gracefully&#xD;
and well, you had better not have agreed to&#xD;
do it at all. Besides, I shall be able to find&#xD;
time to take you about the close of this&#xD;
month; but, after that, I shall have no lei-&#xD;
sure. My business engagements will keep&#xD;
me in New Orleans all winter."&#xD;
"But Gerald-"&#xD;
"Gerald has to remain here. He can't&#xD;
be spared to play escort at a moment's no-&#xD;
tice."&#xD;
"But three weeks, papa! How can I&#xD;
ever be ready?"&#xD;
"By going to work at once. Come, I&#xD;
have to go down to the city to-4ay. Make&#xD;
out a list for Madame What's-her-name, and&#xD;
I will take it to her."&#xD;
"Can't I go with you? I should like to&#xD;
see her myself."&#xD;
"If you won't keep rae waiting, you can&#xD;
go. The boat is nearly due, however."&#xD;
"I will be ready," said Valerie, draining&#xD;
a cup of coffee, with' a sigh. She saw ~that&#xD;
the general's mind was mad'e up, and that,.&#xD;
if she meant to go to Baltimore at all, she'&#xD;
might as well submit with' a good grace5&#xD;
and go at once. So, by dint of vigorous&#xD;
preparation, she announced at the. end of&#xD;
three weeks that she was in travelling or-&#xD;
der, and her father at once set the day of&#xD;
departure.&#xD;

24                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                      ON THE WING.                      25&#xD;
&#xD;
On the eve of that day, Miss Aylrner&#xD;
chamber presented a scene of confusion sue&#xD;
as only the chamber of a young lady o&#xD;
the present careless time possibly couk&#xD;
Into no other place could such a mass o:&#xD;
rainboW-tinted dresses, scarfs, ribbons, lace~&#xD;
trinkets, and shawls, have been gathered i&#xD;
disorder so complete, yet so picturesque, o&#xD;
such monster trunks have stood yawning~&#xD;
for the reception of what seemed likely ti&#xD;
overflow even their mammoth capacities&#xD;
Wardrobes and drawers had emptied thei&#xD;
contents over every available article of fur&#xD;
* nature in the room-.--covering the snowy ex&#xD;
pause of the bed, and every chair, with mu]&#xD;
titudinous odds and ends; so that the oub&#xD;
thing which at all fulfilled its natural us&#xD;
was a low, broad conch under one of th&#xD;
windows, where the titular goddess of thb&#xD;
overcast shrine reposed in the luxurious&#xD;
alx&amp;amp;ndon of the siesta-apparently undis.&#xD;
turned by, and, in fact, unconscious of; all&#xD;
the confusion around her. Not even the&#xD;
~ound of voices roused her, though these&#xD;
voices were not slightly animated; for the&#xD;
young lady, who knelt before a large trunk&#xD;
that occupied the centre of the floor, was&#xD;
in the act of demonstrating to a couple of&#xD;
sable attendants that art of good packing&#xD;
which consists in getting the largest possi-&#xD;
ble amount into the smallest possible space.&#xD;
"Now, Fanchette," she was saying, "I&#xD;
hope I have proved to your satisfaction&#xD;
that It was perfectly possible to put every&#xD;
thing in one tray, which you intended for&#xD;
two. Hand me another of those skirts. I&#xD;
believe I can ge# it in here also. What sire&#xD;
you about, there? Don't you know you&#xD;
must not put that heavy silk on top of those&#xD;
light organdies?"&#xD;
"It won't- hurt 'em, Miss Netta."&#xD;
"Won't hurt them! You must be&#xD;
crazy I I wonder what Valerie's dresses&#xD;
look like, when she reaches the end of a&#xD;
journey, if ~you have the packing of her&#xD;
trunks Now, understand, once for all,&#xD;
that thick things always go to the bottom,&#xD;
and thin ones on top-do you hear?"&#xD;
Fanchette said "Yes'm" very meekly,&#xD;
and lifted the silk from its condemned posi-&#xD;
tion; but, for all that, the glance which she&#xD;
exchanged with her ce-laborer did not sa-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
- vor much of reform; and, if Miss Fane had&#xD;
I, seen it, she might have been assured that&#xD;
f lessons for. general application are always&#xD;
I. wasted on the race to which Fanchette be-&#xD;
t' longed; and that her friend's dresses were&#xD;
;, quite as likely to be crushed by bad packing&#xD;
a in the future, as in the past. She did not&#xD;
r. see it, however; so she went on with her&#xD;
~ efforts to reduce order from chaos.&#xD;
"All the heavy dresses must go by&#xD;
themselves in that trunk yonder-this is for&#xD;
r the light ones. Hand me that poplin, and&#xD;
- let me give you a lesson how to fold the&#xD;
skirt-for Charlotte, I see, is ruining the&#xD;
- one she is attempting to put together.&#xD;
Now look, both of you I back and front to-&#xD;
gether thus-the .train laid over, so-then&#xD;
folded this way-and then that! Valerie,&#xD;
dear, where shall your grenadines go?"&#xD;
Miss Aylmer opened her eyes at this&#xD;
appeal, and cast a helpless glance from the&#xD;
I garments in question to the waiting trunks.&#xD;
"Indeed, Netta, I don't know-any-&#xD;
where that they can get, I suppose."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Netta, dryly; "that&#xD;
is so very satisfactory! Here, Charlotte,&#xD;
bring them here.-Valerie, do you want&#xD;
either of them leftout for this evening?"&#xD;
"What are you going to wear?"&#xD;
"The bar6ge I had on yesterday," said&#xD;
Valerie, as if every word was wrung from&#xD;
her by the severest effort.&#xD;
"You know that won't do! There will&#xD;
be at least a dozen people here to-night."&#xD;
"What do I care? Can't you let me&#xD;
sleep in peace now?"&#xD;
"No, I can't. It is five o'clock, and&#xD;
fully time you were up. Before you have&#xD;
accomplished that endless business of your.&#xD;
toilet, somebody wrn come, in- Charley&#xD;
ilautaine, I'll answer for."&#xD;
"Charley Hautaine can wait until I am&#xD;
ready to receive him."&#xD;
"Valerie, I wonder you are not ashamed&#xD;
of yourself!"&#xD;
"Ashamed! What, of teaching one&#xD;
man-and a very badly-spoiled man-his&#xD;
proper place? I hope I shall never do any&#xD;
thing to be more ashamed of. Now let me&#xD;
rest in peace."&#xD;
"Rest in peace, if you please; ~but I&#xD;
&#xD;
hope you will some day be made to feel in&#xD;
your own person something of all this&#xD;
which you treat so lightly in others."&#xD;
"What do you mean by 'all this?"'&#xD;
"I mean this passion, this impatience,&#xD;
this-this love, in one word."&#xD;
"You had better wish me dead, at&#xD;
once!" said Miss Aylmer, rousing at last&#xD;
to a point of some energy.&#xD;
"So at last you have an inkling of what&#xD;
it is? No, I had better not wish you dead.&#xD;
On the contrary, such an event would be of&#xD;
service to you, in more ways than one.&#xD;
And when you do feel it, and are made&#xD;
thoroughly uncomfortable, just oblige' me&#xD;
by remembering a few of the mice you play&#xD;
with at present-my poor young cousin,&#xD;
especially."&#xD;
"Your poor young cousin! To hear you&#xD;
talk of him, one would think that he was a&#xD;
tender lamb, just escaped from the parental&#xD;
fold, instead of an accomplished wolf in&#xD;
sheep's clothing, fully capable of taking care&#xD;
of himself-and of other people, too!"&#xD;
"Whatever he may be, as far as other&#xD;
people are concerned, you know you have&#xD;
put it out of his power to show any wisdom&#xD;
about you-else, certainly, he would not&#xD;
ride over here every day to be snubbed for&#xD;
his pains.~~&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense!"&#xD;
And, with this. summary conclusion to&#xD;
the conversation, Miss Aylmer buried her&#xD;
head in the pillows, and went to sleep&#xD;
again.&#xD;
She was not destined to slumber long&#xD;
undisturbed, however. Before th~ clock on&#xD;
the mantel had chimed a quarter-past five,&#xD;
a knock at the door was followed by the&#xD;
intelligence that Mr. Hautaine was down-&#xD;
stairs, and had asked for Miss Valerie.&#xD;
"Miss Valerie is asleep. But 12 will&#xD;
waken her, and make her dress. Tell&#xD;
Charley she will be down in about an&#xD;
hour,"&#xD;
With this consolatory message, Miss Fane&#xD;
shut th~ door in John's face, and returned&#xD;
to make a decisive charge on the enemy's&#xD;
lines.&#xD;
"Move those trunks out of the way,~~&#xD;
she said, to the maids. "We have nearly&#xD;
finished, and the few things that remain to&#xD;
&#xD;
be packed can go 'in to-morrow morning.&#xD;
Now, Valerie, my dear, you must get up."&#xD;
"Who days so?" inquired that young&#xD;
lady, without moving an inch.&#xD;
"I say so. You may treat Chancy as&#xD;
you please-or as he pleases to let you-~-but&#xD;
you know your father will expect you to be&#xD;
ready to receive your friends who are com-&#xD;
ing to bid you good-by, and who will cer-&#xD;
tainly be here before you are dressed, if you&#xD;
don't rise at once. So, up with you I&#xD;
Miss Aylmer raised herself suddenly,&#xD;
and threw her arms round her friend, as if&#xD;
with an intention of smothering her, ac-&#xD;
conipanying this unexpected demonstration&#xD;
with a tone ~f the most genuine pathos.&#xD;
'"Oh, Net~a I-my dear, good Netta, how&#xD;
shall I ever live without you? Who will&#xD;
make me do things when you are away?"&#xD;
"You foolish '~hild I" said Miss Fane,&#xD;
as she smoothed back the heavy masses of&#xD;
hair, and looked down into the dark eyes&#xD;
with one of the sweetest smiles that ever&#xD;
made at once lovely and lovable a human&#xD;
face. "I should think you would be more&#xD;
glad than sorry to part with your trouble-&#xD;
some ~&#xD;
"It is you who are foolish now," said&#xD;
Miss Aylmer, decidedly. "Sit down here,"&#xD;
she added, pushing her into a low chair be-&#xD;
side the couch, "I want to talk to you a&#xD;
little while before we go down to all those&#xD;
tiresome people who are coming."&#xD;
"But, Valerie, indeed, it is time that&#xD;
you were dressing!"&#xD;
"Qu'importe? I will show you that I&#xD;
can dress in ten minutes, if you wrn just'be&#xD;
still and listen to me. Netta, dear, do-do&#xD;
you reallythink that I have treated Charley&#xD;
Ilautaine very badly?"&#xD;
"Valerie,, dear," answered her friend,&#xD;
gravely, "I don't think you have treated&#xD;
him well; but I don't think you have acted&#xD;
any worse toward him than I. have seen&#xD;
you act toward i~iany others."&#xD;
"Consoling, upon my word!" said Va-&#xD;
lerie, with a comic grimace. "Well, then,&#xD;
perhaps you may think a little better of me,&#xD;
if I tell you that I firmly expect to make&#xD;
amends for all my high crimes and misde-&#xD;
meaners, by endin~ my days as-Mrs.&#xD;
Charles Hautaine I"&#xD;

VALERIE AYLMER.                                                       ON THE WiNO.                        27&#xD;
&#xD;
"Valerie!-you must be jesting!"&#xD;
"I assure you I am not jesting in the&#xD;
least-unless Marshal McMahou or Owen&#xD;
Meredith should hear of my manifold&#xD;
charms, and feel impelled to come over and&#xD;
make me an offer. I should certainly accept&#xD;
either of the two; but I am afraid I am&#xD;
scarcely justified in reckonii~g very confi-&#xD;
dently on a proposal from one of them."&#xD;
"Valerie, there is really no time for me&#xD;
to sit and listen to such nonsense! If you&#xD;
wrn not dress, I must do so."&#xD;
But Valerie had no idea of allowing&#xD;
this. Being in a talking mood, she was de-&#xD;
termined that her companion should listen;&#xD;
and she kept a firm hold on Miss Pane's&#xD;
dress, as the latter attempted to rise.&#xD;
"No, no, mignon, not yet! You think&#xD;
I am jesting, but indeed I am not."&#xD;
Her friend turned and looked at her in-&#xD;
teutly.&#xD;
"Valerie, I do not understand you. Is&#xD;
this on your honor ?"&#xD;
" On my honor.~~&#xD;
"You are engaged to Oharley, then?"&#xD;
Valerie laughed.&#xD;
"Why should you think that? No; I&#xD;
have not yet given 'a clod of wayward&#xD;
marl" such dominion over me."&#xD;
"Then what do you mean-if you real-&#xD;
ly mean any thing?"&#xD;
"I only mean that I have promised to&#xD;
tell Charley, six months hence, whether or&#xD;
not I like him well enough to immolate my.&#xD;
self on the matrimonial altar for his sake,&#xD;
and I rather think he will be made happy&#xD;
by an affirmative decision."&#xD;
"Do you seriously mean that Oharley has&#xD;
consented to wait six months for the pleas-&#xD;
ure of being rejected?"&#xD;
"The pleasure of being rejected! In-&#xD;
deed, Netta, I don't know what you mean,&#xD;
when I have just told you-"&#xD;
"Yes, I remember what you have just&#xD;
told me. But I take the liberty of knowing&#xD;
you a little better than you know yourself&#xD;
it' you really think that, six months hence,&#xD;
you will not like some other man as well or&#xD;
better than you like Charley now."&#xD;
"You are certainly complimentary!"&#xD;
"~ I am not trying to be complimentary.&#xD;
There are enough peoPle to play that r4le,&#xD;
&#xD;
without my attempting it. What I am&#xD;
anxious to hear is, whether Charl~y has con-&#xD;
sented to such a proposition."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly, he consented~ And was&#xD;
glad enough to do so!,,&#xD;
"Then," said Miss Fane, rising, as if to&#xD;
give additional force to her expression of&#xD;
opinion, "I wash my hands of all concern&#xD;
in his affairs; and deliver him over to your&#xD;
tender mercies, without even a desire to&#xD;
save him. He deserves all that he will be&#xD;
sure to get, for he is more hopelessly ab-&#xD;
surd than even I had imagined!"&#xD;
And with this final disposition of the&#xD;
ge~4~iman, who was jusb then impatiently&#xD;
pacing the front piazza, and rushing into&#xD;
the hail, every time he heard a step on the&#xD;
stairs, she walked to the mirror, and began&#xD;
to take down her hair, as a preliminary to&#xD;
its rearrangement. Valerie lay back on her&#xD;
pillows, and watched the process with an&#xD;
indolent interest which lasted some time.&#xD;
The massive and glossy knot behind (Miss&#xD;
Pane possessed a magnificent chevelure)&#xD;
had received its finishing touches before&#xD;
she spoke again, with a sort of dreamy&#xD;
languor in her tone.&#xD;
"Netta, would you like to see me marry&#xD;
your cousin?"&#xD;
"No," ~aid her friend, promptly. "I&#xD;
should be very sorry to see it."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Because I do not think you would suit&#xD;
Oharley, and I am sure Charley would not&#xD;
suit you."&#xD;
"Why would not I suit him?"&#xD;
"For one thing, because he would soon&#xD;
become conscious, in the wife, of what he&#xD;
overlooks in the mistress-the absence of&#xD;
that devotion which would set him up on a&#xD;
pedestal, and worship him as a divinity.&#xD;
Also, he would feel what he has less sense,&#xD;
than I give him credit for, If he does not ac-&#xD;
knowledge now that you have twice the tal-&#xD;
ent, and three times the intellectual culture,&#xD;
that he possesses. And the one thing of&#xD;
all others which a man can least forgive in&#xD;
his wife, is mental superiority to himself."&#xD;
"Por argument's sake, granting what&#xD;
you say to be true, you surely cannot think&#xD;
so poorly of Chancy, as to suppose that he&#xD;
would everindulge a feeling which is, after&#xD;
&#xD;
all, nothing more nor less than a petty van-&#xD;
ity I"&#xD;
"I think-I am glad to think-that&#xD;
Oharley is, in every sense of the word, a&#xD;
gentleman; and that therefore he would&#xD;
never, even to himself, give expression to~&#xD;
the feeling. But it would exist, neverthe-&#xD;
less - a consciousness that could not be&#xD;
stifled."&#xD;
"And pray why would he not suit me?"&#xD;
"For the very best reason in the world:&#xD;
you need the hand of a master-poor, dear&#xD;
Charley would always be a slave."&#xD;
"Netta," said her friend, decidedly," I&#xD;
think you are the most disagreeable person&#xD;
I ever knew! I wish you would make haste&#xD;
and take yourself off down-stairs to enter-&#xD;
tain your poor, dear Oharley! "&#xD;
"You are very kind; but I have not the&#xD;
least intention of going, until I see you en&#xD;
toilette, and hear when it was that you en-&#xD;
trapped that misguided son of ocean into.&#xD;
this six months' postponement of a proposal."&#xD;
"About three weeks ago-the night I first&#xD;
heard of this hateful visit to Baltimore."&#xD;
"Ah, I see! You wanted to settle be-&#xD;
forehand any hopes M. Vacquant and his&#xD;
nephew might entertain. But I wonder&#xD;
that even such a consideration as that in-&#xD;
duced you to think of relinquishing your&#xD;
dearly-prized freedom.~~&#xD;
"It is a dreadful thought, this surrender-&#xD;
ing one's self to a life-long bondage," said&#xD;
Valerie, with a shudder. "But one has to&#xD;
marry some time-at least 1 have to; for an&#xD;
unmarried woman's place in the world is&#xD;
simply nil; and I have never discovered a&#xD;
vocation in myself for any thing but the&#xD;
world. Now, I don't suppose I shall ever&#xD;
find a more desirable parti than Charley,&#xD;
or a person less likely to prove disagreeable&#xD;
in the matrimonial connection."&#xD;
"Poor Charley!~~&#xD;
"And pray why should you say 'Poor&#xD;
Charley' in that tone of commiseration?"&#xD;
"Because I feel sincerely sorry for any&#xD;
man who offers honest devotion, and in re-&#xD;
turn is only accepted as apis-aller! I have'&#xD;
been shocked by hearing other women talk'&#xD;
so, Valerie; I confess I never expected it&#xD;
from you."&#xD;
"You never expected it less than I did,&#xD;
&#xD;
Netta," said Valerie, gravely. "But. we&#xD;
learn wisdom as we grow older; and, after&#xD;
all, are not we getting beyond the school-&#xD;
girl idea of romantic passion, and the like?&#xD;
Of course we be1~eved in it devoutly four or&#xD;
five years ago, but do we believe in it now?&#xD;
Honestly, I don't! I don't believe that, ex-~&#xD;
cepting in novels, and with foolish women&#xD;
who set up idols, and fall down and wor-&#xD;
ship them, there is such a thing as the love&#xD;
we have dreamed about. Do you?"&#xD;
~ said MissPane; "yes, I d~. I'm&#xD;
never likely to know it, but I believe it n6iie..&#xD;
the less-believe it, just as I believe many&#xD;
things which are of faith, and not of sight."- -&#xD;
"Well, I don't," said Valerie, decidedly~ - -&#xD;
and she leaned back on her cushions,. aii&amp;amp;&#xD;
gazed out of the window. "I think it-is~&#xD;
fiction that the poets and novelists- are in&#xD;
league to keep up, and the rest of the world&#xD;
are afraid to declare exploded. 1sthatnon-.&#xD;
sense? You look as if you thought so. But&#xD;
just tell me, Netta, did you ever know a&#xD;
real case of real love?"&#xD;
Miss Pane thought a moment. "In my&#xD;
own experience, do you mean?" she asked.&#xD;
7~&#xD;
"Of course, jn your own experience.&#xD;
"I am afraid I must say meyer did; but&#xD;
still, I believe in it."&#xD;
"I envy you your credulity," returned&#xD;
her skeptical friend. "But how can you&#xD;
believe what you have never seen? If I had&#xD;
ever seen it-seen, that is, not the flirtation&#xD;
of a few weeks, ending in a proposal, and a&#xD;
wedding, but the love which is strong to&#xD;
conquer, and stronger to endure-the love&#xD;
which absence cannot change, which diffi-&#xD;
culty only quickens, which saffenin~ only&#xD;
elevates-I, too, might believe. But now-&#xD;
bahi I am a heretic of the straitest sect.&#xD;
Do you mean to say that,, if women ever&#xD;
really felt as heroines are represented to&#xD;
feel, I should not before this have conceived.&#xD;
a grands passion for some of thqdear, charm-&#xD;
ing boys I have known so well, and liked so&#xD;
much, while they were with me, and never&#xD;
cared a straw about, when they were&#xD;
away?"&#xD;
"That is hardly a fair argument, Vale-&#xD;
ne&#xD;
"I should like to know where you could&#xD;
find a fairer one. I confess that I should&#xD;

&#xD;
like to fall in love, if onlyTor the novelty of&#xD;
the sensation," pursued the young lady,&#xD;
with meditative frankness. "I should like&#xD;
to know what it was to fa~icy somebody well&#xD;
enough to admire every thing he said or did&#xD;
-even bi~ very absurdities-to put away&#xD;
the roses he had touched, and wear the&#xD;
dresses he had praised, to care as much&#xD;
about him when he was absent as when he&#xD;
was near-to count the hours of his absence,&#xD;
and look eagerly for his coming-to be will-&#xD;
ing to endure any degree of danger, or dis-&#xD;
comfort for his sake-and, finally, to let&#xD;
love c~ver even wrong and injury, if wrong&#xD;
or injury came.' But then, I never shall&#xD;
know it, and this is all nonsense! I like&#xD;
Charley, as well as I can like anybody;&#xD;
and I mean to take him. I think I was fool-&#xD;
ish not toniake the engagement absolute at&#xD;
once. Many women- women better in&#xD;
every way than I am-have waited longer&#xD;
than I have for their knight, and waited'&#xD;
vainly. Some of them do as I am about to&#xD;
do-make respect and affection serve the&#xD;
place of love, and marry some pleasant and&#xD;
e1igibl~person, whom they Iil~e well enough,&#xD;
for all practical purposes, to the end of their&#xD;
lives. Others, like yourself, disdain to take&#xD;
this course, and so go down to their graves&#xD;
in' maiden meditation fancy free.' I am in-&#xD;
clined to think that this class is much larger&#xD;
than the world believes."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I certainly think it is a mistake to sup-&#xD;
pose that every woman has had, or must&#xD;
have, her love-story."&#xD;
"I know it is a mistake; or, rather; it is&#xD;
a vulgar belief of vulgar minds, which no&#xD;
demonstration to the contrary could uproot.&#xD;
If the entire feminine sex were suddenly&#xD;
conveyed to the Castle of Truth, and exam-&#xD;
ined on the point, I think we should hear&#xD;
some strange revelations from maids, wives,&#xD;
and widows; and I think the vast majority&#xD;
would be on my side, and declare that the&#xD;
coming man had never come into their lives&#xD;
at all."&#xD;
"That would be my evidence, at least,"&#xD;
said Miss Fane, laughing. "Now you have&#xD;
oratorized long enough. Suppose, by way&#xD;
of variety, you get up and dress I"&#xD;
"You are not interested in my subject."&#xD;
"Indeed I am-interested enough to&#xD;
hope that your coming man may make his&#xD;
appearance in time."&#xD;
"Is that for my sake, or for Charley's?"&#xD;
"For both-and equally. Only-don't&#xD;
fall in love with this cousin of yours."&#xD;
"Had you not better caution me against&#xD;
throwing myself headlong into the Pataps-&#xD;
co I" said Miss Aylmer, rising. "Please&#xD;
ring that bell for Fanchette. I want my&#xD;
blue grenadine, and I feel morally confident&#xD;
that it is down at the bottom of that largest&#xD;
trunk."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
~~MY PRETTY PAGE.'~&#xD;
Tun cold N~ovember morning was break-&#xD;
ing drearily through a heavy white fog, that&#xD;
enveloped from sight all the low Maryland&#xD;
coast, and even the roofs and spires of Bal-&#xD;
timore, when the Portsmouth boat steamed&#xD;
slowly up to her dock; after a very trying&#xD;
and disagreeable run. A stiffish gale is by&#xD;
no means to be despised - even on the&#xD;
Chesapeake-and, although 'there had been&#xD;
no~very heavy sea the night before, yet many&#xD;
uncomfortable stomachs on board the Lou-&#xD;
isiana might have compared honorable&#xD;
notes with those belonging to any ocean-&#xD;
bound steamer the second day out. Sounds&#xD;
of woe had proceeded all night from various&#xD;
state-rooms; calls for sympathy, and for&#xD;
brandy, had been unnumbered; and, among&#xD;
the knot of passengers who stood on the wet&#xD;
deck in the cold, gray morning, and gloomily&#xD;
regarded the few landmarks that peered&#xD;
through the fog, the only feminine presence&#xD;
was that of Miss Aylmer, who, leaning on&#xD;
her father's arm, watched with evident in-&#xD;
terest as much of the surrounding prQspect&#xD;
as could be seen.&#xD;
"It does not look very interesting, does&#xD;
it, papa'?" she said, as the fog partially lift-&#xD;
ed, and showed that portion of Baltimore&#xD;
which lies along the water's edge.' "But&#xD;
then, I suppose one should not judge 'of a&#xD;
city by its approach, and in a fog, too. I&#xD;
only wonder-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Draw your shawl around you more&#xD;
closely; this air is very penetrating," said&#xD;
her father, as she paused. "Well-what is&#xD;
it you wonder?"&#xD;
She hesitated a moment before she went&#xD;
on, rather thoughtfully:&#xD;
"I only wonder whether I shall ever be&#xD;
reconciled to this visit. I am almost sure I&#xD;
never shall. I am almost sure this coming&#xD;
six months will prove as long in reality as&#xD;
it now seems in prospeetive.~~&#xD;
"I, should think you would know your-&#xD;
self better," said the general, dryly. "One&#xD;
opera; two balls, and a few conquests, will&#xD;

am half inclined to wager that, at the end of&#xD;
the six months, you will voluntarily prolong&#xD;
your visit, perhaps indefinitely."&#xD;
"Don't wager much then, papa~," retort-&#xD;
ed the young lady, with very nonchalant&#xD;
sauciness, "for I know you are not fond of&#xD;
losing. ttgh I what an odious cliniate! I&#xD;
cannot understand how1 grandpapa en-&#xD;

"It i~ singular, considering that the&#xD;

"Entirely," the general answered.&#xD;

&#xD;
is a very disagreeable woman; but you must&#xD;
really endeavor to conciliate her prejudices.&#xD;
tier influence over your grandfather is much&#xD;
greater than that of any one else; and&#xD;
there's no wiser policy than that of throw-&#xD;
ing a sop to Cerberus, you know."&#xD;
He spoke with studied carelessness-for&#xD;
no one better understood the art of clothing&#xD;
unpalatable advice in unpremeditated guise&#xD;
-yet the words brought a sudden cloud&#xD;
over his daughter's face. Her brow slightly&#xD;
contracted, and her lips compressed them-&#xD;
selves, before she replied:&#xD;
"I hoped I had heard the last of such&#xD;
warnings, papa. Surely there is nobody else&#xD;
to be conciliated, is there? And yet-in&#xD;
the face of all this-you think I shall find a&#xD;
visit here more than bearable? For my&#xD;
part, I shall be very glad if it does not&#xD;
prove mueh less. I believe I am 'chilled&#xD;
through. Will you please take me, in?"&#xD;
Her father complied very willingly. In-&#xD;
deed, it was quite time, the last motion of&#xD;
the boat having ceased, and the downward&#xD;
rush of passengers fairly begun.&#xD;
General Aylmer and his daughter were&#xD;
experienced travellers, hoWever, and pos-&#xD;
sessed to perfection the rare capability of&#xD;
taking matters-even from a steamboat and&#xD;
railroad point of view - with a supreme&#xD;
quibtude. They' did not trouble themselves&#xD;
in the least about making haste to be gone;&#xD;
and Valerie was still standing by a table in&#xD;
the saloon, drawing on her gloves, and wait-&#xD;
ing for her father, who had returned to his&#xD;
state-room for some missing' satchel, when&#xD;
a step on the gangway caused her to turn&#xD;
round, and thus confront a gentleman, who&#xD;
came forward with a look in his eyes that&#xD;
even' diilness' might have interpreted-a&#xD;
half-doubt, half-recognition, which made her&#xD;
absolutely certain he would, in another mo-&#xD;
ment, utter her own name. During that mo-&#xD;
mant, while he still passed irresolute, she&#xD;
took arapid survey of his appearance; for&#xD;
one fact at least Was undoubted-that of his&#xD;
complete strangeness to her.&#xD;
Her firs1~ impression was, that sbe bad&#xD;
never 'seen a handsomer man-if nian he&#xD;
e~arld~properlybe called, who was apparent-&#xD;
ly s6 little past the age 'of adolescence that&#xD;
almost any one might have been temptedto&#xD;
&#xD;
[..&#xD;
&#xD;
exclaim, "What a beautiful boy!" There&#xD;
was all of boyhood's smoothness of outline,&#xD;
and clearness of tint, in the face whose re-&#xD;
fined features and waxen complexion suited&#xD;
its rich broww curls and lustrous eyes; all&#xD;
of boyhood's grace in the slender figure,&#xD;
that bore upon it a stamp of such thorough-&#xD;
bred elegance-yet there was about both an&#xD;
air and manner which proved conclusively&#xD;
that, for this man, boyhood was long since&#xD;
over. True, the downy softness had not&#xD;
yet left the rounded cheek, the pearly&#xD;
whiteness had not yet vanished from the&#xD;
smooth brow, and there was a curve of:al-&#xD;
most child-like beauty about the shapely&#xD;
mouth; but, on, each and all of these fea-&#xD;
tures, there also rested a shade of intangi-&#xD;
ble expression which aged the face without&#xD;
strengthening it, and marked it so plainly&#xD;
with the sign-manual of worldly inter-&#xD;
course and worldly thought, that no one,&#xD;
after a second glance, could possibly have&#xD;
mistaken the presence of manhood for that&#xD;
of youth. It was a beautiful face, but that&#xD;
was almost all that could be said of it. If&#xD;
there was any thing else about it at all re-&#xD;
markable, it might, perhaps, have been&#xD;
found in the total lack of any decided ex-&#xD;
pression, either for good or ill. Nobody&#xD;
could have called it a pleasant face or a dis-&#xD;
agreeable face, an intellectual face or a stu-&#xD;
pid face, an honest face or a deceitful face,&#xD;
a face that prepossesse&amp;amp; liking or inspired&#xD;
distrust; for, in truth, it was simplynega-&#xD;
tive-a face of the kind that we see very&#xD;
often in the world, and that belongs to peo-&#xD;
ple who, as a general thing, lack both&#xD;
mental and moral force, and are exactly&#xD;
and entirely what circumstances make&#xD;
them. It was also emphatically, and in&#xD;
marked degree, a spoiled face. There was&#xD;
a curve of disdain about the mouth, and a&#xD;
cloud of petulance on the' brow, whieh&#xD;
deepened and lightened continually, with-&#xD;
out ever quite vanishing, and made even the&#xD;
most careless observer sure that this man&#xD;
had never in his life known the curb of&#xD;
wholesome restraint, imposed either by oth-&#xD;
ers or himself~&#xD;
With all her quickness of glance, Miss&#xD;
Aylmer hadn't noted more than these few&#xD;
general points, when the unknown ad.&#xD;
&#xD;
iranced directly to her side, saying, in a&#xD;
voice that suited his face, it was so very&#xD;
melodious:                  4&#xD;
"I am sure I cannot be mistaken in&#xD;
'thinking that I have the pleasure of see-&#xD;
ing Miss Aylmer. Let me bid her wel-&#xD;
come to Baltimore, and introduce to her-&#xD;
Julian Romney."&#xD;
Valerie started-then looked up with&#xD;
recognition. It was a name not wholly un-&#xD;
familiar, though long forgotteu-.-the name&#xD;
of her grandfather's step-son, who had been&#xD;
sent to a German university before his&#xD;
mother's second marriage, and whom, con-&#xD;
sequently, she had never met. Indeed, the&#xD;
gulf 'of non-intercourse between the two&#xD;
families-M. Vacquant remained in Balti-&#xD;
more during the war-had almost sivept&#xD;
the recollection of his very existence out of&#xD;
her memory. She did not say' so, however;&#xD;
~n the contrary, she smiled cordially, and&#xD;
held out her hand in reply.&#xD;
"I am charmed to meet you," she said,&#xD;
"for of course I have heard of you very&#xD;
often. I am only ashamed that my recog-&#xD;
nition was not like your own, instinctive."&#xD;
"I trust my recognition would have&#xD;
been instinctive," the young man answered,&#xD;
smiling in his turn; "but, unfortunately, I&#xD;
cannot claim that merit for it. My step-&#xD;
father has a miniature of you, and its want&#xD;
of justice does n~t altogether detract from&#xD;
its possession of likeness."&#xD;
"Ah, of course-it was very stupid of&#xD;
me not to think," Valerie laughed. "I&#xD;
think I should have known you, though-&#xD;
after a while. But graixdpapa and Madame&#xD;
Vacquant-I hope they are both well?"&#xD;
"Quite well, and very anxious to see&#xD;
you; indeed, M. Vacquant is.waiting below&#xD;
in the carriage now. Will you let me take&#xD;
you to him? That is-surely you are not&#xD;
travelling alone?"&#xD;
"Oh, no.-Fapa-but here he is.-Papa,&#xD;
this is Mr. Romney, who has been kind&#xD;
enough to come to meet us."&#xD;
The general's memory of names was&#xD;
much better than his daughter's, as well as&#xD;
his memory of faces; and, looking at the&#xD;
young man before him, he saw a slightly-&#xD;
masculinized edition of his father-in-law's&#xD;
wife~' He would have found no difficulty,&#xD;
&#xD;
therefore, in determining his identity, even&#xD;
if Valerie had not spoken, and his hand&#xD;
went out at once in its frank, genial greeting.&#xD;
"I should have known you, Mr. Born-&#xD;
ney, by your likeness to your mother," he&#xD;
said. "I congratulate you on your return&#xD;
to America. As matters stand at present,&#xD;
a Baltirnorean is almost the only person&#xD;
whom we coa congratulate on such an event.&#xD;
When did you leave Jena?"&#xD;
"Only within the last few' months,"&#xD;
answered the other, while Valerie marvelled&#xD;
now, as she had marvelled often before, at&#xD;
her father's wonderful recollection. Noth-&#xD;
ing seemed to escape him-not even the&#xD;
name of Julian Ilomney's university-when&#xD;
of Julian Romney himself she never re-&#xD;
membered to have heard him speak. "Only&#xD;
within the last few months," repeated that&#xD;
young gentleman; "and, but for the fact&#xD;
that home is home, I might have been sorry&#xD;
enough to do so. As a place of residence,&#xD;
Germany is infinitely preferable to America,&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
"Any place short of the Inferno would&#xD;
be~ that, just at present,~~ said the general,&#xD;
with a shrug. "However, you might get&#xD;
on very well. You don't know any thing&#xD;
about war and devastation, just here."&#xD;
It was now Romney's turn to shrug his&#xD;
shoulders, which he did very indolently and&#xD;
gracefully.&#xD;
"You don't suppose I was thinking&#xD;
about war or devastation, or any thing of&#xD;
that kind?" he asked. "I don't trouble&#xD;
myself about those matters. I was thinking&#xD;
that the people are such barbarians, from&#xD;
an aesthetic point of view. But NL Vac-&#xD;
quant must be very impatient. Will you&#xD;
excuse me if I suggest that you take com-&#xD;
passion on him."&#xD;
"M. Vacquant!" said General Aylmer,&#xD;
quickly. "I did not know that he was&#xD;
here-of course we will go at once.-Vale-&#xD;
ne, I wonder you waited for me. Give that&#xD;
shawl to Fanchette, and now,' take care-&#xD;
these steps are confoundedly steep."&#xD;
"Take care, Miss Aylmer," echoed&#xD;
Romney, for, he saw that her eyes ware not&#xD;
at all where 'they should have been, but&#xD;
rather on the dock beyond, where a private&#xD;
carriage was drawn up, at the door 'of&#xD;

32                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                  A FREE LANGE OF TO-DAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
which her grandfather's face looked eager-&#xD;
ly forth. "Take care-take care!"&#xD;
The last caution went off like a pistol-&#xD;
shot, bet it was too late. Valerie sudden-&#xD;
ly missed her footing-stumbled-made a&#xD;
grasp at the support-missed it-and fell&#xD;
heavily forward.&#xD;
General Aylmei~ was too far in advance,&#xD;
Julian too much in the rear, to save her.&#xD;
They could only hasten to her assistance,&#xD;
and, asit chanced, the younger man was the&#xD;
first to reach her, the first to lift the prone&#xD;
figure, and look into the pale, stunned face,&#xD;
the first to inquire anxiously if she was badly&#xD;
hurt.&#xD;
"I-I don't think I am hurt at all," she&#xD;
said, after a. minute's pause. "At least-&#xD;
I cannot tell. I saved my head, and only&#xD;
my wrist pains."&#xD;
"Take my arm, then, and try to walk,"&#xD;
said the general. "Your grandfather is&#xD;
getting out of the carriage, I see. You&#xD;
must have alarmed him very much."&#xD;
"Oh, I am sorry for that," she said,&#xD;
quickly; and she at once made an attempt&#xD;
to step forward, but it was only an attempt.&#xD;
A spasm of pain came over her face, and&#xD;
Romney, who was watching her, said, as he&#xD;
caught her just in time to prevent another&#xD;
fall:&#xD;
"You have sprained your ankle?"&#xD;
~ she answered, with a gasp, "I&#xD;
think I have. What shall I do ?-J cannot&#xD;
walk."&#xD;
"We shall have to support you," said her&#xD;
father, with some annoyance in his voice.-&#xD;
"Mr. Romney, may I trouble you I--Valerie,&#xD;
there would ~iave been none of this, if you&#xD;
had only looked where you were going."&#xD;
Valerie did not reply; in fact her whole&#xD;
attention at that moment was concentrated&#xD;
on her ankle. The lightest pressure of her&#xD;
foot on the ground made it pain intensely;&#xD;
and she did not even remember until ~ome&#xD;
time afterward how solicitous and careful&#xD;
was the support rendered by her new ac-&#xD;
quaintance. When they reached the car-&#xD;
riage, M. Vacquant was very much con-&#xD;
cerned by the palloy of the face, which never-&#xD;
theless contrived to greet him with a smile.&#xD;
"Ma pause enLfatzt I" lie said, in the&#xD;
midst of his effusive embrace. "To think&#xD;
&#xD;
that such an accident should be your wel-&#xD;
come among us! What was Julian about,&#xD;
that he did not take bettor care of you? I&#xD;
wish I had gone for you myself."&#xD;
"Mr. Romney took very good care of&#xD;
me," said Valerie, with a grateful smile into&#xD;
the handsome face just then bending over&#xD;
her. "But he could not prevent my fall,&#xD;
you know. That was your fault, grandpapa-&#xD;
if it was any body's besides my own-for it&#xD;
was only because I was looking at you that&#xD;
I missed the step."&#xD;
"Don't be ungrateful, Valerie, or your&#xD;
grandfather will think he had better have&#xD;
stayed at home," interposed General Ayl-&#xD;
mer, with a smile.-" My dear sir, I am&#xD;
delighted to see you again, and to see you&#xD;
looking so well. How much you escaped in&#xD;
not being battered about like the rest of us,&#xD;
during four years of hardship and ~&#xD;
"I don't know, I am sure," said M. Vac-&#xD;
quant, a little shortly, for he always felt as&#xD;
if be had been somewhat derelict in not&#xD;
sharing the suffering of his country, and he&#xD;
did not much relish congratulations on the&#xD;
score of his exemption. "I am really un-&#xD;
able to see that you are at all battered, Ger-&#xD;
ald. On the contrary, you seem quite as&#xD;
young-looking and good-looking as ever.&#xD;
But we may as w~ll defer compliments until&#xD;
we are under way. Come in-petite looks&#xD;
too pale to be detained.-Home, John, and&#xD;
drive fast."&#xD;
The coachman obeyed to the letter; but&#xD;
the foot of Union Dock and the head of&#xD;
Washington Place are two points of the&#xD;
good city of Baltimore which lie rather far&#xD;
apart; and, with all his speed, they had not&#xD;
made more than half their distance, when&#xD;
Romney, who was watching Valerie quite&#xD;
anxiously, said-&#xD;
"I am sure you are suffering very&#xD;
much."&#xD;
She looked up with a faint smile, but an-&#xD;
swered nothing, for she could not deny the&#xD;
assertion. The pain almost amounted to&#xD;
agony by this time, and required every par-&#xD;
ticle of her self-control to endure it silently..&#xD;
So she only smiled, and clinched her bands&#xD;
tightly together, as. people always dowben&#xD;
they want to bear passively, while they&#xD;
rolled on-her father end M. Vacquant talk-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing to each other of Louisiana people end&#xD;
things, Juliati watching her silently, and she&#xD;
engrossed by the pain-along the crowded&#xD;
thoroughfares of business life, past the gay&#xD;
shops and streams of pedestrians, past the&#xD;
towering cathedral-dome, and into sight of&#xD;
a tall white column-When, just as she&#xD;
thought, "I cannot endure it another mo-&#xD;
ment!" the carriage stopped, and Julian&#xD;
hurst open the door before the footman&#xD;
could spring down to do so.&#xD;
Dimly, Valerie saw that they had paused&#xD;
before a large gray house, with a stately&#xD;
portico and flight of marble steps guarded&#xD;
by couchant lions, and that, as they drew&#xD;
up, a gentleman, who was in the act of as-&#xD;
scending these steps, turned hastily and&#xD;
came down again toward them. But physi-&#xD;
cal agony had nowreached the point of physi-&#xD;
cal blindness, and she had onlya vague idea of&#xD;
a strange face, in which there was a good&#xD;
deal of surprise, and heard her grandfather&#xD;
make some hurried explanation. Neither the&#xD;
face nor the explanation moved her to the&#xD;
least interest, however, until M. Vacquant&#xD;
turned round, saying with his most gr~ziuZ-&#xD;
seigneur air:&#xD;
"Valerie, my love, your cousin-Maurice&#xD;
Darcy."&#xD;
Then she looked up-curious to see this&#xD;
rival claimant of her inheritance, this cause&#xD;
of her present exile and suffering, this man&#xD;
whose name had been her ~te noire for many&#xD;
weeks past; but, at the very moment when&#xD;
she raised her eyes, the tortured ankle gave&#xD;
one hot, sharp pang, that misted all th3&#xD;
kind pity of Maurice Darcy's face, and made&#xD;
her extend her hand, with a sort of blind&#xD;
impulse, past him to Julian Romney.&#xD;
~ Take me out, please," she said to the lat-&#xD;
icr, with a certain knowledge that in another&#xD;
second she would scream, despite herself.&#xD;
Darcy drew back-Valerie never knew&#xD;
that his hand had been held out toward her&#xD;
with a kinsman's frank greeting~ when she&#xD;
thus put it aside-and Romney assisted her&#xD;
to the ground, not without much difficulty&#xD;
and intense pain, however. Indeed, the&#xD;
blanching cheek proved such sharp suffer-&#xD;
ing that it brought the other to her side all&#xD;
of a sudden, with one quick step.&#xD;
"Let me assist you," he said to Julian. I&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
"Miss Aylmer is evidently suffering very&#xD;
much-4oo much for even an attempt at&#xD;
walking, I should say. Would it not be bet-&#xD;
ter if she was carried-"&#xD;
But here Valerie interrupted him, al-&#xD;
most rudely, for pain gave a sharper tone to&#xD;
her voice than was meant:&#xD;
"Thank you, no. I can walk very well&#xD;
-with Mr. Romney's assistance."&#xD;
"Pray let Maurice carry you, Valerie,"&#xD;
said M. Vacquant's voice in the rear. "He is&#xD;
stronger than any of us-and well able to do&#xD;
so.&#xD;
But Valerie only shook her head wil-&#xD;
fully; and, as General Aylmer was not near&#xD;
enough to interfere, lifted her foot to take&#xD;
the first step of the flight before her. The&#xD;
result was easily to be foreseen-she gave&#xD;
one sharp cry, and fell back on Romney's&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
The partial swoon which ensued was&#xD;
not so deep but that she heard M. Vacquant&#xD;
say, "Maurice, take her! "-but that she&#xD;
felt herself lifted at once by a pair of strong&#xD;
arms, carried like a child into the house,&#xD;
and, amid much feminine commotion, laid&#xD;
gently down on a softly-cushioned couch.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
A FBEfl LANCE OF TO-DAY.&#xD;
WUEN the doctor, who was hastily sum-&#xD;
moned, arrived, his first care was to relieve&#xD;
the injured foot of all ligatures; his ~eoond,&#xD;
to apply arnica-saturated bandages; and his&#xD;
third, to assure M. Vacquant that the pa-&#xD;
tient needed only entire quiet. "She will&#xD;
not be able to walk for some time," he said,&#xD;
on taking his departure; "but she may&#xD;
probably be carried down-stairs andi join:&#xD;
the family circle to-morrow." ~&#xD;
He was mistaken, however. The~ sprain.&#xD;
proved more serious than had beek im-&#xD;
agined, and several days elapsed before Miss&#xD;
Aylmer summoned courage or inclInation~&#xD;
to make an appearance down-stairs. At&#xD;
last, one evening, a sudden whim, or fit of&#xD;
loneliness, seized her. She tossed the novel,~&#xD;
over which she was yawning, clear across~&#xD;

34                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                  A FIIEE LANCH OF TO-DAY.                35&#xD;
&#xD;
the room, rang her bell, made a toilet, and,&#xD;
with the assistance of her own and Madame&#xD;
Vacquant's maids, managed to descend to&#xD;
the drawing-room, while dinner was yet in&#xD;
progress, and the coast clear.&#xD;
"That will do, Fanchette," she said, to her&#xD;
faithful attendant, who, after she had been&#xD;
established, on a sofa, still hovered over her,&#xD;
suggesting a pillow here, and a cushion there.&#xD;
"That really will do. I am very comforta-&#xD;
ble-more comfortable than I deserve to&#xD;
be," she added; "for I begin to think it was&#xD;
very foolish of me to come down."&#xD;
"'Deed, ma'am, I think it was very&#xD;
right," Fanchette said, earnestly. "You&#xD;
was so lonesome-like up-stairs! It'll do&#xD;
you good to see some company.&#xD;
"That's rather a question," her mistress&#xD;
answered, languidly. "I feel just now more&#xD;
as if it would tire me; and then, I never&#xD;
looked worse 1"&#xD;
"You looks pale, ma'ani-but paleness is&#xD;
becoming to you," said Fanchette, consol-&#xD;
ingly; for Fanchette stood chief among the&#xD;
admirers of Za belle des belles-a fact which&#xD;
in itself is no contemptible proof of the gen-&#xD;
uineness of Miss Aylmor's loveliness, since&#xD;
few scorns are more sincere than that of a&#xD;
maid for the beauty she daily aids in mak-&#xD;
ing up.&#xD;
The invalid acknowledged her friendly&#xD;
comfort by a smile; and then nestled deep-&#xD;
er iato her cushions, saying, as she stretched&#xD;
out, with a slight grimace, the pretty san-&#xD;
dulled foot that was resting on a pillow:&#xD;
".1 don't trust you, Fanchette; you con-&#xD;
sider me so entirely in the light of your&#xD;
handiwork, that you regard me with partial&#xD;
eyes. Throw that afghan lightly over me.&#xD;
There !-Is not some one coming?"&#xD;
'Before Fanchette could answer, the&#xD;
doer opened, and a lady entered-a lady&#xD;
so handsome and stately, that, as she&#xD;
came forward in the full light of the&#xD;
chandelier, she looked more like some rare&#xD;
old picture stepped from its frame, than a&#xD;
mere flesh-and-blood woman of the present&#xD;
time.. She 'was not. a young woman, by&#xD;
any means, and not a woman who made&#xD;
any ill-judged attempt to look young; but&#xD;
every thing about her ha9monized so per-&#xD;
fect~y, and. was in such admirable keeping&#xD;
&#xD;
with her personal style and her manifest&#xD;
age, that it was a question whether she was&#xD;
not better worth looking at than the fresh-&#xD;
est beauty in her teens. Girlhood i~ a&#xD;
very pretty and a very charming, thing, no&#xD;
doubt, but girlhood, even in its brightest&#xD;
and sweetest form, has never been able and&#xD;
will never be able to hold its own, with any&#xD;
moderate measure of success, against the&#xD;
charm of a woman who, instead of fading,&#xD;
has ripened into maturity; and whose per-&#xD;
sonal gifts have gained the toning and ex-&#xD;
pression that only time can bestow. It is&#xD;
not often that we see the warm zenith of&#xD;
feminine loveliness attained-for there are&#xD;
many dwarfing and blighting influences .at&#xD;
work in almost every woman's life, that&#xD;
se~id her into the port of middle age, shat-&#xD;
tered, if not wrecked-but a glimpse of it&#xD;
is vouchsafed to us sometimes, and we are&#xD;
richer for that glimpse to the end of our&#xD;
lives. It is something inexpressibly grace-&#xD;
ful and beautiful, something that has no jar&#xD;
or clang of discordance in it, something that&#xD;
is refined to the exquisite point of needing&#xD;
no further refinement, and something which&#xD;
was breathed like an aroma over the woman&#xD;
who came forward now. She was certainly&#xD;
a beautiful woman. Her delicate features&#xD;
were chiselled with the clearness and regu-&#xD;
larity of sculpture, her rich brown hair was&#xD;
abundant as any ehevelure of twenty, and&#xD;
had a glow upon it which proved conclu-&#xD;
sively that the art of the dyer had'never&#xD;
been called into requisition; her violet eyes&#xD;
had lost not a tint 'of their color, during the&#xD;
half-century that had passed over them;&#xD;
and her slender, symmetrical figure bore it-&#xD;
self with a dignity' which seemed to add at&#xD;
least two inches to her real stature. Gen-&#xD;
eral Aylmer had been right in saying that&#xD;
he would easily have recognized Julian&#xD;
Romney by his likeness to his mother;' yet,&#xD;
alike as the two faces were in cast of fea-&#xD;
ture, there, was a difference between them,&#xD;
which, resting in diverse expression, some-&#xD;
times deepened into positive dissimilarity.&#xD;
it could, scarcely have been otherwise, since&#xD;
the younger face was mobile to excess-the&#xD;
lip ever ready to curl, the brow ever ready&#xD;
to bend-while the elder was locked in the&#xD;
passionlessness of marble. The finely-arched&#xD;
&#xD;
brow seldom met~ in any frown; the cold,&#xD;
calm lip rarely smiled; and, whatever&#xD;
strength of passion or capability of emo-&#xD;
tion existed in the depths of this woman's&#xD;
nature, she had long since placed a strong&#xD;
curb over-a curb that gave a repressed&#xD;
quietude to her manner, and was the cause'&#xD;
of a certain repulsion, which more than one&#xD;
person confessed to experiencing when un-&#xD;
der her influence. Yet few people have&#xD;
been more universally admired, or more&#xD;
justly commended; and, as she crossed the&#xD;
floor in her rich silk and soft laces, Valerie&#xD;
acknowledged, for perhaps the fiftieth time,&#xD;
that, when her grandfather chose a second&#xD;
wife, his taste, in beauty at least, had been&#xD;
irreproachable.&#xD;
"What !-you down I" she said, as she&#xD;
came forward, and perceived the occupant&#xD;
of the sofa. "I doubt if it 'was prudent to&#xD;
walk on your foot, yet a while, Valerie.&#xD;
You should have been carried down, as the&#xD;
doctor advised."&#xD;
"Fanchette and Rose helped me," said&#xD;
Valerie. "I scarcely walked at all."&#xD;
"Fanchette and Ros4 could not give all&#xD;
the assistance you must have needed. Your&#xD;
grandfather was just speaking of taking&#xD;
Maurice up to bring you down."&#xD;
"That would have been more imposing,&#xD;
certainly, but not more to my taste," said&#xD;
Valerie, with a laugh. "I had a suspicion&#xD;
of that plan of grandpapa's, so I was all the&#xD;
mere anxious to steal a march on him. Be-&#xD;
sides, I really was dreadfully tired of my&#xD;
room and my novels."&#xD;
"I don't wonder at it," said the elder&#xD;
lady, as she sat down in a high-backed&#xD;
Gothic chair, which made her look more like&#xD;
a picture than ever, and drew forward an&#xD;
eiubroidery-frarae. "Needle-work has quite&#xD;
gone out of fashion, I believe," she went on,&#xD;
"or I' should think you would have found&#xD;
that a pleasanter as well as a more profita-&#xD;
ble occupation."&#xD;
"Do you mean hemming handkerchiefs&#xD;
or embroidering ottomans?" asked Valerie,&#xD;
more flippantly than was quite proper; but&#xD;
the temptation to rejoinder was strong, and&#xD;
liking, between this handsome lady and her-&#xD;
self, there had never been enough to insure&#xD;
an amicable t~te-d-t~te. "Fanchette relieves&#xD;
&#xD;
me of the Ilrst, and, as for the other, I don't&#xD;
belong to any charitable association; so I&#xD;
should have no means of disposing of them&#xD;
after they were finished."&#xD;
"If you have no room for them at&#xD;
Aylmers, your friends might like them as&#xD;
'souvenirs," said Madame Vacquant, whose&#xD;
sneers were never apparent on the surface.&#xD;
" You are so well provided with friends,&#xD;
that there would be no difficulty about find-&#xD;
ing recipients. I hope, by-the-way, you left&#xD;
Miss Fane quite well?"&#xD;
"Quite well," Vulerie answered, with a&#xD;
saucy sparkle in her eyes. "It is kind of&#xD;
you to inquire about Netta, for I know you&#xD;
do not like her; but then that is not singu-&#xD;
lar. I-believe we all failed to please you in&#xD;
our poor Louisiana.~~&#xD;
"The climate did not agree with me,"&#xD;
said Madame Yacquant, quietly; "other-&#xD;
wise, I had no fault to find. The fruits are&#xD;
delicious, and the people charmingly hospita-&#xD;
ble. But I really think I should have died&#xD;
if I had remained, the lassitude and prostra-&#xD;
tion were so great. I don't wonder that&#xD;
women there fade early-or that 'you have&#xD;
gone off so much, Valerie."'&#xD;
"I never knew that women faded ear-&#xD;
lier there than elsewhere," returned Vale-&#xD;
rie, nonchalantly. "And, as for my going&#xD;
off, I know I am hideous just now; but I&#xD;
have Baltimore to thank for that. When I&#xD;
left home, everybody said I was looking re-&#xD;
markably welL"&#xD;
"People who see one constantly are not&#xD;
always the best judges of one's looks," said&#xD;
Madame Vacquant. "Perhaps, after you&#xD;
have been in Maryland a while, you may re-&#xD;
cover something of your bloom. You used&#xD;
to have a very bright complexion."&#xD;
"One needs to come to Maryland to hear&#xD;
unflattering truths," Valerie answered, with&#xD;
undiminished good-humor. "Nobody in&#xD;
Louisiana ever spoke of my complexion in&#xD;
the past tense; but then probably our stand-&#xD;
ard is not a good one. I may beable to do&#xD;
something toward improving it when I go&#xD;
back. Are not those the gentlemen's voices?&#xD;
How soon they leave the table!"&#xD;
"Your grandfather does not like to sit&#xD;
long," said Madame Vacquant, pausing in&#xD;
her work to listen; "and JulianI know, has&#xD;

VALERIE AYLMER.                                                   A FREfl LANCE ~F TO-DAY.                 37&#xD;
&#xD;
/an engagement ±'or this evening. That is&#xD;
Maurice Darcy speaking now. You have&#xD;
not met him yet, I believe?"&#xD;
"Not unless you consider my fainting es-&#xD;
capade in the light of a meeting. He must be&#xD;
very strong; for I weigh a great deal, and-"&#xD;
The opening of the door cut short her&#xD;
sentence; and the next moment, her father,&#xD;
accompanied by a tall, stalwart stranger,&#xD;
entered the room. They were speaking to-&#xD;
gether as they crossed the floor, and did&#xD;
not notice her presence for an instant; then&#xD;
General Aylmer looked round, and was not&#xD;
a little surprised '&#xD;
"You here, Valerie!" he said. "How&#xD;
did you manage to get down?. Your grand-&#xD;
father has just gone up-stairs to see you."&#xD;
"I am very sorry," said Valerie, with&#xD;
more contrition than was perhaps sincere.&#xD;
"But, you see, I meant to surprise him, and&#xD;
-won't yon.please call him back, papa?"&#xD;
"He will soon find that the bird has&#xD;
flown," answered the general, coolly.&#xD;
"Meanwhile, have you forgotten CaptaiTh&#xD;
Darcy?"&#xD;
Valerie lool~ed up at his companion.&#xD;
Even despite the disadvantage under which&#xD;
she .had seen tt before, she thought she&#xD;
would have re~ognized again the face that&#xD;
had gazed at her' through the mist of past&#xD;
suffering. But she must have been mistaken&#xD;
-for, if she had appreciated one-half of its&#xD;
compassionate kindness on that day, she&#xD;
could scarcely have spoken with as much&#xD;
coldness as when she answered:&#xD;
"No, I have not forgotten Captain Dar-&#xD;
cy, and I am glad to be able to thank him&#xD;
for his assistance and strength, when I&#xD;
needed both sadly. Without them, I don't&#xD;
know how I should ever have found myself&#xD;
in thehouse that day."&#xD;
"I only hope you are better," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Darcy, speaking very courteously, but&#xD;
making no effort to ahakehands or, any thing&#xD;
of the kind.' "It is a pity that your arrival&#xD;
in Baltimore should have been so disagree-&#xD;
ably signalized."&#xD;
"I don't kni~w about its being disagree-&#xD;
able," she answered, carelessly. "I have&#xD;
had several days to myself, and I have read&#xD;
many entertaining and a few instructive&#xD;
books; and both of these novelties are&#xD;
&#xD;
worth the price of a sprain, I dare say.&#xD;
Oh, I am always philosophical-am I&#xD;
not, papa? Eugene used to declare that, if&#xD;
the house were burned down, I would say at&#xD;
once that it was the pleasantest thing, izna-&#xD;
ginable, since trees and grass were a great&#xD;
deal more healthful and comfortable than&#xD;
roofs and floors. I must not quote Eugene,&#xD;
however, for here comes grandpapa."&#xD;
M. Vacquant entered as she spoke-a&#xD;
little out of breath, and a good deal out of&#xD;
humor.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of this, Valerie?"&#xD;
he asked, quite injuredly. "I thought you&#xD;
could not walk, so I go up-stairs to see you,&#xD;
and am coolly informed that you have gone&#xD;
down! Did you time your descent exactly&#xD;
for the purpose of giving me a useless jour-&#xD;
ney? By Jove, how tired I am!"&#xD;
"So you have taken to swearing in Eng-&#xD;
lish!" Valerie laughed, as he sat down&#xD;
by her. "No, I didn't time my descent for&#xD;
any reason of the kind," she went on. "I&#xD;
down to give you a pleasant surprise,&#xD;
and this is all the thanks I get. I wonder&#xD;
you are not ashamed to be so ungrateful."&#xD;
",So that's the light, is it?" said he,&#xD;
with.a shrug. "Well, I'll make apologies,&#xD;
when I recover breath enough. Meanwhile,&#xD;
let us hear whom you were quoting when I&#xD;
came ~&#xD;
"Nobody you care about," said Valerie,&#xD;
giving his hand an affectionate little pinch.&#xD;
"I was only quoting my hero, my darling,&#xD;
my soldier of fortune, my-"&#xD;
"Oh, Eugene," said he, in a very unen-&#xD;
thusiastic tone.&#xD;
"Yes, Eugene. What have you to say&#xD;
against him?"&#xD;
"Only that I hope he has not been fished&#xD;
out of the Seine in a starving condition yet."&#xD;
* "Tell him about him," said Valerie,&#xD;
turning triumphantly to her father, and&#xD;
getting decidedly aground among her per-&#xD;
sonal pronouns. "Tell him all that we&#xD;
beard last about the dear boy: how well he&#xD;
is doing; and how steady he is; and how&#xD;
much everybody likes him; and-"&#xD;
"And how ready you are to believe It&#xD;
all," said NI. Vacquant, stopping her mouth&#xD;
with peremptory good-humor. "I don't&#xD;
want to hear any thing about the ~camp!&#xD;
&#xD;
If he had, stayed at home, and turned shoe-&#xD;
black, now, I might have' forgiven him;&#xD;
but, to go off and join the eondotti~sri I"&#xD;
"I thought you liked condottieri, grand-&#xD;
papa," said Valerie, and her eyes turned&#xD;
more significantly than she intended toward&#xD;
Captain Darcy, who was standing beside&#xD;
Madame Yacquant, and who caught the&#xD;
glance at once.&#xD;
"I don't know why you thought so,"&#xD;
said her grandfather. "I like them so lit-&#xD;
tle, that Maurice and I have had more than&#xD;
one disagreement on the subject."&#xD;
"Captain Darcy likes them, then?" said&#xD;
Valerie, making an ill-judged assault on the&#xD;
enemy's lines.&#xD;
That depends upon whether you mean&#xD;
condotti~ri in the literal or the social&#xD;
sense," answered Captain Darcy for him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"In the social seine, undoubtedly," re-&#xD;
turned she, promptly.&#xD;
"Then I don't like them in the least,"&#xD;
he answered. "But, in the literal sense, it&#xD;
would be strange if I had not at least a sym-&#xD;
pathy for them, since I belong to a race that&#xD;
for the last three hundred years has fur-&#xD;
nished soldiers of fortune to the whole&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"And liked nothing better!" said M.&#xD;
Vacquant. "Deuce .take the fellow !-&#xD;
he'd be a free lance to - morrow, if he&#xD;
"He was a free lance yesterday," said&#xD;
General Aylmer, with a smile. "We must&#xD;
not forget that."&#xD;
Darcy turned away, and walked down&#xD;
the room. General Aylmcr followed him,&#xD;
and, while they stood together, in a broad&#xD;
glow of light, Valerie had no better occupa-&#xD;
tion for her eyes than to note the appear-&#xD;
ance of this soldier-artist who had been ad-&#xD;
vanced to the dignity of kinship with her.&#xD;
This. was all that she aaw.-a tall, well-&#xD;
built figure,, whose deep, broad chest, and&#xD;
lithe, sinewy limbs, were pleasant sights for&#xD;
people who had apenok4nt in the way of&#xD;
manly strength or manly prowess- and&#xD;
whose stalwart, . well - carried shoulders&#xD;
looked as if they could have borne the very&#xD;
burden of Atlas without blench or quiver;&#xD;
a face that suited the figure excellently well,&#xD;
&#xD;
for it was frank and bold, more soldierly&#xD;
than artistic, and only moderately hand-&#xD;
some. Indeed, as Valerie regarded it from&#xD;
behind the friendly shelter of M. Yacquant,&#xD;
she did not think it handsome at all. Cer-&#xD;
tainly there was wonderfully little of the&#xD;
petit-maitre or trim gallant-about it-little&#xD;
to please the eye that admired Charley JIau-&#xD;
tame's insouciant grace, or Julian Romney's&#xD;
ideal beauty-but a good deal, nevertheless,&#xD;
that many women, as well as many men,&#xD;
liked to look upon. There were straight,&#xD;
clearly-cut features, deep, dark-gray eyes&#xD;
that might have been handsome, if they had&#xD;
not been too cold and critical; a mouth that&#xD;
was 'somewhat set and stern, under the&#xD;
thick chestnut mustache; the square, bel-&#xD;
ligerent chin, that mars the beauty of many&#xD;
a born fighter's face; the broad artist-brow,&#xD;
that is never wholly-without attraction, and&#xD;
an abundant amount of crisp chestnut hair.&#xD;
Together with these things, there was a&#xD;
striking absence of that which, for want of&#xD;
a better name, we may call the conventional&#xD;
.stamp-the stamp that in these days squares&#xD;
and trims everybody and every thing into&#xD;
conventional shape-and a striking presence&#xD;
of 'fresh and vigorous individuality. The&#xD;
man had his faults-they were written, in-&#xD;
deed, onhis very face-but you felt more&#xD;
than half-inclined to forgive them all, in&#xD;
gratitude for the novelty of seeing one who&#xD;
looked, moved, and spoke, not according to&#xD;
certain social rules and canons, but accord-&#xD;
ing to the exigence of the hour and the&#xD;
need of the minute; yet who never, in even&#xD;
the faintest shade of word, look, or tone,&#xD;
violated that higher law of perfect courtesy&#xD;
which is the flower of true refinement. The&#xD;
man was a man, but he was also a gentle-&#xD;
man, and none~ the less the 'first for' being&#xD;
so entirely the last. You could see at once'&#xD;
that he was frank and straightforward to a&#xD;
fault, formed for action rather. than for di-&#xD;
plomaey~ very apt to clear his way with&#xD;
clean, even strokes, andlittle likely to ~h6w&#xD;
tolerance in any case 'of attempted' wiles;&#xD;
but you also felt sure that he was-a man who&#xD;
would be gentle to 'the weak, 'and tender to&#xD;
those whom he loved, with the supren~iegen-&#xD;
tleness and tenderness that a'e born' of&#xD;
strength. Nevertheless, let it not, be sup-&#xD;

&#xD;
posed that there was any thing of the Titan,&#xD;
or the genius, or the hero, about him. He&#xD;
was simply a man who had some of the best&#xD;
attributes of common manhood stamped&#xD;
upon him-the courage and simplicity, the&#xD;
generosity and faithfulness, the scorn of all&#xD;
things base, and the very unconsciousness&#xD;
of all things mean, which are 'uncommon&#xD;
enough, Heaven knows, but which go fur-&#xD;
ther to make up our idea of true manhood&#xD;
than all the polish or all the learning of all&#xD;
the schools.&#xD;
"He looks like a free companion," Va-&#xD;
* lerie thought to herself, while Madame Vac-&#xD;
quant described the manner in which halr&#xD;
was dressed, and dilated upon the latest&#xD;
style of bonnet. "I wonder if the soldiers&#xD;
of the Irish brigade at Fontenoy were men&#xD;
of this kind? If so, no wonder the English&#xD;
- Yes, madame, I think that must have&#xD;
been a lovely bonnet; but you know I could&#xD;
not wear any thing of the sort. Pearl and&#xD;
blue would make a fright of me."&#xD;
" No; of course you could not, ~ said&#xD;
Madame Vacquant. "I was only describing&#xD;
it. You always have scarlet somewhere&#xD;
about your bonnets, I believe."&#xD;
*   "A knot of scarlet roses, or perhaps a&#xD;
cluster of fuchsias," said Valerie, who was&#xD;
not a whit behind the most of her sex in&#xD;
devotion to 'the toilet. "I like fuchsias-&#xD;
they are so graceful andbecoming.-Grand-&#xD;
papa, I wonder if Captain Darcy had any&#xD;
ancestors at the battle of Fontenoy?"&#xD;
"I don't know, I am sure," said M. Vac-&#xD;
quant. "What on earth put that into your&#xD;
head?"&#xD;
"Nothing," she laughed; and then she&#xD;
hummed under her breath, to an impromp-&#xD;
tu air:&#xD;
"'On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, nor ever yet elsewhere,&#xD;
Rushed onto light a nobler band than those proud&#xD;
exiles were."'&#xD;
"You must try and get down to Easter's,&#xD;
to-morrow," Madame Vacquant went on&#xD;
"There is a silk there, I am sure you will&#xD;
like. I saw it a week ago, and told them to&#xD;
put it aside; but such people are so unre-&#xD;
liable. It is a lovely gold-color; and under&#xD;
black lace-you still have that overdress of&#xD;
Spanish lace, I suppose, Valerie?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," 8aid Valerie; "of course I&#xD;
&#xD;
have it yet-such things as that are heir-&#xD;
looms, you know. I need a silk for it, too;&#xD;
and I shall certainly get the gold-color, if it&#xD;
is pretty; but then, I have no doubt of that.&#xD;
'On Fontenoy, on Fontenoy, like eagles in the sun'-&#xD;
What's the next line, grandpapa?"&#xD;
"I never heard the thing, Valerie."&#xD;
"Oh, of course you have-only you've&#xD;
forgotten:&#xD;
'Like lions leaping at a fold, when mad with hunger's&#xD;
pang,&#xD;
Right up against the English line the Irish exiles&#xD;
sprang:&#xD;
Bright was their steel-'"&#xD;
The battle of Fontenoy ,came to an&#xD;
abrupt end just here, for the door opened,&#xD;
and a radiant vision entered-to wit, Julian&#xD;
Romney, in full evening costume. He en-&#xD;
tered listlessly, with something of a fretful&#xD;
cloud on his face; hut a single glance at th~&#xD;
sofa was enough to dispel it, and the next&#xD;
moment he came forward, smiling brightly.&#xD;
"Miss Aylmer! What an unexpected&#xD;
pleasure this is! But why was I not allowed&#xD;
my share in the triumph of bringing you&#xD;
down?"&#xD;
"There was no triumph in the matter,"&#xD;
Valerie said, with a laugh. "I came down&#xD;
very quietly, assisted only by Fanchette and&#xD;
Rose."&#xD;
"When?"&#xD;
"While you were all at dinner."&#xD;
"While we were at dinner-and I just&#xD;
to know it!"&#xD;
"It has not been long."&#xD;
"It has been long enough to make me&#xD;
wish that Mrs. Jennings and her party were&#xD;
both in Halifax; or that I had looked in the&#xD;
drawing-room when I came up-stairs. How&#xD;
could I have been so obtuse as not to know&#xD;
by instinct that you were here? ' Don't&#xD;
laugh, Miss Aylmer-it is a very serious&#xD;
matter, I assure you."&#xD;
Miss Aylmer did laugh, however. His&#xD;
petulance and vexation seemed so little&#xD;
more than that ofa spoiled child; and there&#xD;
was so much of the "pretty page" about&#xD;
him, that she felt half-inclined to extend&#xD;
her hand and caress the curl-bedecked head.&#xD;
A timely recollection of propriety inter-&#xD;
fered, however; and she only shook, her&#xD;
own as she answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your flatteries deserve a pleasanter re-&#xD;
ward than any thing they have missed; or&#xD;
are likely to gain. My mirror tells me that&#xD;
I never looked worse, and my conscience&#xD;
assures me that I never felt more stupid."&#xD;
"For the peace of our city, don't look&#xD;
any better, then," said he, with only a half-&#xD;
tone of jest. "And as for stupidity-pity&#xD;
mine, when I have not yet inquired about&#xD;
your ankle. Is it well enough for you to&#xD;
walk at all?"&#xD;
"I think not," answered she, with a du-&#xD;
bious glance toward it. "But really, I have&#xD;
not tried. I limped down on one foot; for&#xD;
I have such a vivid remembrance of my ag-&#xD;
ony the other day, that I did not have the&#xD;
courage to put this one on the floor."&#xD;
"You ought to do it," however, said&#xD;
Madame Vacquant. "Your ankle will nev-&#xD;
er grow strong again unless you use it. Is&#xD;
not that so, my dear?"&#xD;
"Certainly it is so," said M. Vacquant;&#xD;
"but petite knows best. She can judge&#xD;
whether it feels equal to the exertion yet."&#xD;
"I am by no means sure of that," said&#xD;
Julian, while petite herself looked doubt-&#xD;
ful. "Suppose you try to walk?" he add-&#xD;
ed, turning abruptly to the latter. "I am&#xD;
confident your ankle is strong enough by&#xD;
this time to bear the exertion. Come! let&#xD;
me assist you."&#xD;
He held out his hand, but \Talerie shook&#xD;
her head.&#xD;
"Not this evening - to-morrow, per-&#xD;
haps," she said.&#xD;
"To-morrow I maynot be able to help&#xD;
you," answered he~ "Pray, try now-if&#xD;
only a few steps. I should like to feel that&#xD;
I was making some amends for allowing&#xD;
that dreadful fall."&#xD;
"Allowing! How could you have pre-&#xD;
vented it?"&#xD;
He only smiled, and held out his hand&#xD;
again. "Will you not try? Just a few&#xD;
5teps.7~&#xD;
He looked s&amp;amp;, imploring, and so hand-&#xD;
some, that for once Valerie developed an in-&#xD;
capacity to say no~&#xD;
"If you will not insist, in case it hurts&#xD;
me, "she began.&#xD;
She was interrupted by protestations and&#xD;
assurances to the contrary; so, after a mo-&#xD;
&#xD;
meiit, she slowly brought the injured foot&#xD;
to the floor, and tried its strength, before&#xD;
rising.&#xD;
"Does it hurt?" asked M. Vacquant.&#xD;
"N-o. Mr. Romney was right, I be-&#xD;
lieve. It scarcely hurts at all-as'yet. Now&#xD;
I will try to walk."&#xD;
"Let me call Maurice to assist you also,"&#xD;
said her grandfather, in a tone which was&#xD;
unluckily loud enough to reach Captain Dar-&#xD;
cy's ears. He started and turned, just in&#xD;
time to hear Valerie say with decision:&#xD;
"No; certainly not. Mr. Romney will&#xD;
assist me; and, if I need any one else, I&#xD;
can ~call papa."&#xD;
Then she laid her hand on Julian's arm,&#xD;
and, thus supported, walked slowly down&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"Take care. Don't over-exert your&#xD;
ankle," said General Aylmer, turning round&#xD;
as she advanced. "How does it feel?"&#xD;
"Very well indeed,", she answered. "I&#xD;
am ashamed to remember how cowardly I&#xD;
have been about trying it.-No, Mr. Romney,&#xD;
you need not turn back; I think I will&#xD;
walk down the next room."&#xD;
"Had you not better be cautious I" asked&#xD;
Darcy. "Your foot must be weak yet."&#xD;
"Of course it is weak; and that's the&#xD;
reason I want to strengthen it," said she,&#xD;
lightly.-" Mr. Romney, I am sorry to lean&#xD;
so heavily. I hope my weight is not very&#xD;
great."&#xD;
Neither of the gentlemen heard Rom-&#xD;
ney's reply, for he moved on before it was&#xD;
spoken; but they saw the light that came&#xD;
into his eyes, as he answered; and being,&#xD;
in different ways, men of the worltlboth&#xD;
shrugged their shoulders mentally.&#xD;
"I must give Valerie warning that her&#xD;
favorite game won't answer here," thought&#xD;
the father. "Fooling this pretty-faced boy&#xD;
would be a trifling affair in itself; but mak-&#xD;
ing an enemy of his mother would ruin&#xD;
every thing."&#xD;
"A thorough-paced coquette," thought&#xD;
Maurice Darcy; "and more ripe for mis-&#xD;
chief than even themost of her class. Poor&#xD;
Julian I "&#xD;
Poor Julian was meanwhile leading his.&#xD;
companion through one after the other of&#xD;

"What a beautiful place I ~' Valerie said,&#xD;
pausing in. the door, and gazing with loving&#xD;
eyes at the interior, where the luxuriant&#xD;
children of her fair South brought some-&#xD;
thing of their tropical bloom and beauty&#xD;
about the chill existence of the North.&#xD;

Romney answered by leading her for-&#xD;
ward, and the next moment she saw that,.&#xD;
almost immediately in the centre of the con-&#xD;
servatory, a jet of water was playing in a&#xD;
marble basin, making a soft, fairy-like mu-&#xD;
sic of its own, and gleaming like a silver&#xD;
mist through the mellow gloom. All around&#xD;
it broad-leaved water-plants were arranged&#xD;
with unusual taste and skill; while the&#xD;
most rare of the flowering shrubs were clus-&#xD;
tered in the immediate neighborhood, and&#xD;
tall, feathery crests nodded, or seemed to&#xD;
nod, in the dimmer background.&#xD;
This. time Valerie did not exclaim,&#xD;
"What a beautiful place!" She only felt&#xD;
a sharp throb, half-exquisite pleasure, half-&#xD;
exquisite pain, which all forms of the beau-&#xD;
tiful bring to some organizations; and then&#xD;
she said softly, "It looks like home."&#xD;
"I am glad I was the first person to&#xD;
bring you here, then," said Romney, quickly.&#xD;
"I am glad that the place which reminds&#xD;
you of home, must also remind you a little&#xD;
of me. Sit down. You must rest before&#xD;
you try to go back."&#xD;
There was everything to second the re-&#xD;
quest; so Valerie yielded without much&#xD;
demur. "We cannot stay long, or they&#xD;
will miss us," she said, hesitatingly; and,&#xD;
having cleared her conscience by this re-&#xD;
mark, she sat down and gave herself up to&#xD;
the charm of the spot. The soft lamps&#xD;
glimmered so far away that they threw only&#xD;
a sort of moonlight radiance through the&#xD;
heavy tropical foliage; the brilliant blos-&#xD;
soms of the Southern flora were blooming&#xD;
on every side, and their rich, subtle fra-&#xD;
grance was heavy on the air; the water&#xD;
rose and fell with the measured rhythmthat&#xD;
in itself lulled to quiescence; and so, while&#xD;
the party, a few rooms distant, sat down to&#xD;
whist, counted their tricks, and scored their&#xD;
&#xD;
honors, these two lingered and yet lingered&#xD;
in what seemed, to one of them at least, a&#xD;
fairy-land.&#xD;
Ali, it is a subtler and a deeper question&#xD;
than many of us think, that of determining&#xD;
whether the women who are gifted with&#xD;
the fatal gift which we call fascination,&#xD;
are strictly accountable f~r all the harm&#xD;
and evil this woful charm may work upon&#xD;
others. There are some women-we do&#xD;
not usually meet more than one in a lifetime&#xD;
-whose simplest tones and most careless&#xD;
glances contain more of magic then all the&#xD;
philters ever compounded by cunning necro.~&#xD;
inancers-women whose powers no man has&#xD;
ever been wise enough to define, and few,&#xD;
very few, strong enough to resist; women&#xD;
than whom hundreds are fairer, and nobler,&#xD;
and wittier; but to whom Nature has given&#xD;
one dower that only Nature can bestow-&#xD;
the rare and perilous dower of being all&#xD;
things to all men. Now, are such women&#xD;
morally accountable for all the pain, the&#xD;
suffering, and the harm, which-unwitting-&#xD;
ly often-they never fail to cause? Are&#xD;
their white hands stained with the blood&#xD;
which has flowed for them, the pangs that&#xD;
have been endured, the lives wrecked, the&#xD;
curses breathed I Surely, if so, we might&#xD;
be more willing to accept the guilt of that&#xD;
poor wretch whom they are leading yonder&#xD;
down the long sunlit road toward the high&#xD;
hill where, tall and dark, one sombre outline&#xD;
cuts against the sky; him whose pale lips are.&#xD;
even now moving in agonized prayer; and&#xD;
whom the great surging multitude willhun-&#xD;
grily watch when the cord is drawn. around&#xD;
his neck, and he goes from man's justice to&#xD;
the bar of God's mercy.&#xD;
There is more point in this digression&#xD;
than is at once apparent. We are told that,&#xD;
in a matter of this kind, guilt or innocence&#xD;
is all a case of "intention." This seems&#xD;
hard, sometimes-hard that the instigator&#xD;
may go scot-free of penalty, while the vic-&#xD;
tim bears the weight of sin, as well as of suf-&#xD;
fering; but, after all, who can draw the line&#xD;
of that "intention?" Who of us does not&#xD;
know&#xD;
"That evil Is wrought by want of thought,&#xD;
As well as by want of heart?"&#xD;
And who of us can believe that want of&#xD;
&#xD;
thought will plead our excuse in the awful&#xD;
Reckoning, when every idle word will rise&#xD;
up against us? One thing at least is cer-&#xD;
tam: in after-days it will go hard with Va-&#xD;
lerie Aylmer if her conscience be not clear&#xD;
of all intention to modulate her tones so&#xD;
well, to sheathe her glances so soft, and to&#xD;
let kindness-plain and simple kindness&#xD;
only, she would tell you-dwell in every&#xD;
word on that night when Julian Romney&#xD;
sat 1y her side, and found his fate in her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
Found his fate! That is a term of which&#xD;
romantic school-girls are very fond; and,&#xD;
like as not, it may sound absurdly exagger-&#xD;
ated to the men and women of the day, who&#xD;
sneer at human passion as they sneer at&#xD;
every thing else on the earth beneath, and&#xD;
in the heavens above the earth; but, for all&#xD;
that, there is such a thing yet, and will be&#xD;
such a thing, as long as women are beguilers&#xD;
and men are beguiled. Whether the term&#xD;
be correct or not-whether or not, in the&#xD;
fullest sense, Julian Romney found his fate&#xD;
in Valerie Ayliner's eyes-the sequel may&#xD;
show; but at least something of the fact be-&#xD;
gan to be apparent to herself before the&#xD;
evening was over. After the last good-nights&#xD;
had been exchanged, and when the fair&#xD;
Southern head laid itself down upon its pil-&#xD;
lows, a vision came back of the beautiful&#xD;
boyish face that had kindled and glowed so&#xD;
warmly during those hours beside the foun-&#xD;
tain-the face that just then was close to&#xD;
that of a blond belle in the vales d deux&#xD;
temps, and which saw before it, not the gold-&#xD;
en curls and azure eyes of sweet Violate&#xD;
Arle, but the lips which were even then&#xD;
murmuring:&#xD;
"Poor boy! J must try and not do him&#xD;
any harm."&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE GENERAL GIvES A wARNING.&#xD;
No one was very much surprised the&#xD;
next morning when the door of the break-&#xD;
fast-room opened, and Miss Aylmer made&#xD;
her appearance, looking so blooming and&#xD;
bright in a rich crinison cashmere, that even&#xD;
&#xD;
Madame Vacquant felt inclined to doubt&#xD;
whether the climate of Louisiana was quite&#xD;
as injurious to complexions as she had sup-&#xD;
posed. The young lady received her con-&#xD;
gratulations and greetings very quietly;&#xD;
then, subsiding into a chair by Romney, she&#xD;
bade him tell her how the night had gone&#xD;
in the way of the Jennings's party.&#xD;
"Heavily enough, as far as I was con-&#xD;
cerned," he answered. "Other people&#xD;
seemed to be enjoying themselves in usual&#xD;
degree; but I never found aA evening more&#xD;
hopelessly dull. I am glad you have come&#xD;
down to give us a glimpse of your face this&#xD;
morning; otherwise, I should have carried a&#xD;
nightmare about with me all day."&#xD;
"What was so dreadful?" asked his&#xD;
step-father-" the wine, the women, or the&#xD;
music?"&#xD;
The young man shrugged his shoulders&#xD;
petulantly.&#xD;
"How can I tell? It was all a hideous&#xD;
conglomeration of sight and sound-so hid-&#xD;
eous, that the wine might have been goose-&#xD;
berry, the women dressed in bunting, and&#xD;
the band playing a dead-march, for aught I&#xD;
knew, or cared, to the contrary!"&#xD;
"Oh, we understand," said the elder&#xD;
gentleman. "The fault being in yourself-&#xD;
as it generally is-Mrs. Jennings's entertain-&#xD;
ment must bear the blame. It strikes me&#xD;
that, instead of saying 'the evening was dull,'&#xD;
you should have said 'I was dull,' and stated&#xD;
the matter more fairly."&#xD;
"Do9sn't it come to the same thing?"&#xD;
asked Valerie; for her quick eye caught the&#xD;
sudden cloud that came over Julian's face.&#xD;
"By no means," her grandfather an-&#xD;
swered. "Here's Maurice, for instance,&#xD;
who, not being given to morbid fancies,&#xD;
enjoyed himself, I will venture to say, like&#xD;
a sensible man.-How was it, mom ami ?-&#xD;
am I not right?"&#xD;
Darcy looked up from a ~iewspaper-&#xD;
both General Aylmer and himself had&#xD;
drawn back from the table, and were en-&#xD;
gaged~ one with the Gazette, and the other&#xD;
with the Sun-but did not seem to need any.&#xD;
information about the subject under discus-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"I thought the evening went off very&#xD;
well," he said; "but, then, I'm n~ver hard&#xD;

42                     VALERIE AYLMER.                                              TIlE GENERAL GIVES A WARNING.            43&#xD;
&#xD;
to please, you know. Julian certainly must&#xD;
have found a bitter savor in every thing,&#xD;
for not the melancholy Jacques himself&#xD;
could have looked more wearied. I heard&#xD;
more than one 'bright-eyed lonnilelle' ask&#xD;
what misfortune had befallen him."&#xD;
He spoke carelessly, but in a tone of&#xD;
good-humored pleasantry, that did not at&#xD;
all justify Romney's sharp retort:&#xD;
"I am glad you found so much time to&#xD;
observe my proceedings, and I am sorry I&#xD;
can't return the compliment by bearing per-&#xD;
sonal testimony to yours. I only remember&#xD;
that one 'bright-eyed Ionnilelle' at least&#xD;
could have made no inquiry about me-the&#xD;
one, I mean, whom you engrossed the&#xD;
greater part of the evening."&#xD;
"Who was that?" asked Madame Vac-&#xD;
quant, speaking for the first time since she&#xD;
bade Valerie good-morning.&#xD;
"I suppose he means Miss Rivi~re," said&#xD;
Darcy, with a smile. "She was looking&#xD;
charmingly last night, and I danced with&#xD;
her several times; but I should hardly have&#xD;
thought that made out a case of engrossing."&#xD;
"Rividre!" Valerie repeated. "That is&#xD;
a Louisiana name."&#xD;
"These are Louisiana people," said M.&#xD;
Vacquant.-" Aylmer, you remember Henry&#xD;
Rivi&amp;amp;e~ II am&#xD;
"Perfectly," said the general, looking&#xD;
np. "And, by-the-way, his is one of the&#xD;
worst cases of utter smash I know of."&#xD;
"So I supposed; for he is here in busi-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
The other raised his eyebrows with an&#xD;
expression of surprise.&#xD;
"Rivi~re! If it were possible to be&#xD;
astonished by any thing, these days, I&#xD;
should certainly think you must be mis-&#xD;
taken. I can fancy him connected with&#xD;
every thing in the world except business.&#xD;
By-the-by, that is a very indefinite term,&#xD;
and means any thing, from ship-owning' to&#xD;
shoemaking. What does it stand for in&#xD;
this ease?"&#xD;
"Some banking position or other, I&#xD;
think. He seems to be getting on tolerably;&#xD;
and is clever enough to succeed very well,'&#xD;
if he will only keep away from race-courses,&#xD;
and let cards and dice alone."&#xD;
"Ab! if he only can," said the general,&#xD;
&#xD;
in a tone of profound incredulity concern-&#xD;
ing the probability of any thing of the kind.&#xD;
And then he went back to the Sun.&#xD;
"Has he a daughter, and is her name&#xD;
Alix?" Valerie inquired.&#xD;
"He has a daughter, and her name is&#xD;
Alix," Romney replied. "She has made&#xD;
something of a sensation here. Do you&#xD;
mean to say you know her?"&#xD;
"I met her once or twice-not oftener,&#xD;
for she was very young, and not in society&#xD;
-but I remember that I thought her very&#xD;
attractive. Is she not very petite, with&#xD;
soft brown eyes, and shy, caressing man-&#xD;
ners?"&#xD;
"And a color that comes and goes&#xD;
twenty times in a minute-exactly. She&#xD;
is said to be very charming; but Darcy&#xD;
there has cultivated her more than I have,&#xD;
and can speak with better knowledge."&#xD;
"she is one of the most thoroughly&#xD;
natural and thoroughly attractive people&#xD;
I ever knew,,~ said Darcy, warmly. "I&#xD;
sincerely congratulate you, Miss Aylmcr, on&#xD;
the discovery of such a friend."&#xD;
"Such an acquaintance," Madame Vac-&#xD;
quant corrected. "Valerie did not speak&#xD;
of her as a friend-did you, my dear? I&#xD;
should be sorry, if so, for I have heard one&#xD;
or two rumored about her,, which, if true,&#xD;
make her rather undesirable even as an ac-&#xD;
quaintance."&#xD;
'~ One or two rumors about Miss Ri-&#xD;
vi~re 1" said Darcy, quickly. "Excuse&#xD;
me, madame, if I ask what they are-for&#xD;
nothing could possibly be true that would&#xD;
render her an undesirable acquaintance for&#xD;
Miss Aylmer."&#xD;
"Excuse me for not remembering that&#xD;
she had such a warm champion at hand,"&#xD;
said the lady, smiling, though not very&#xD;
pleasantly; "and moderate your warmth,&#xD;
my dear Maurice, for I meant nothing in&#xD;
the least dreadfuL I have heard that Miss&#xD;
Rivi~re is studying music, with a view to&#xD;
going on the stage-that is all. But I&#xD;
am sure you will agree with me that it is&#xD;
enough to justify what I said. Valerie&#xD;
would scarcely care to make a friend of a&#xD;
future cantatrice."&#xD;
"That would depend very much upon&#xD;
circumstances, or, rather, upon the person&#xD;
&#xD;
in question," said Valerie, coolly. "Now I&#xD;
should make a friend of Alix Rivinre, not&#xD;
of the future cantatrice-if the rumor is&#xD;
true."&#xD;
"Let us hope that it is not," said M.&#xD;
Vacquant, lifting up his spoon to break an&#xD;
egg, and balancing it in the air as he spoke.&#xD;
"In my opinion, it is one of the worst signs&#xD;
of the times that the new generation begin&#xD;
to throw off somany of the old traditions&#xD;
of gentle blood, and to disregard so entire-&#xD;
ly the ohl no1~ease-oilige theory of gentle&#xD;
birth," he went on. "Equality and fra-&#xD;
ternity are vile enough in a political sense;&#xD;
but the devil himself could not imagine any&#xD;
thing worse than their social enforcement&#xD;
would be! Yet all these latter-day notions&#xD;
are paving the way for little else. We are&#xD;
told that it is a very fine thing to be liberal;&#xD;
that a gentleman may be a gentleman,&#xD;
though he turn blacksmith; and a lady may&#xD;
continue a lady though she becomes an ac-&#xD;
tress; that good ancestry is of no account;&#xD;
and a good name worth exactly what it will&#xD;
bring at the bottom of a check! I may be&#xD;
illiberal," continued he, bringing down his&#xD;
spoon with a crash into the egg-shell, "but&#xD;
I don't see the force of such reasoning, and&#xD;
I have an unmitigated contempt for such&#xD;
practice ~&#xD;
"Don't excite yourself grandpapa," Va&#xD;
lerie laughed. "And, besides, I don't see&#xD;
the force of your reasoning in the present&#xD;
case. There are no better people in Louisi-&#xD;
ana than the Rivi~res."&#xD;
"So much the more cause for their not&#xD;
forgetting the fact," said he. "However,&#xD;
we'll be charitable. The rumor about the&#xD;
young lady may not be true. I am sure I&#xD;
hope it is not, since I don't know a more&#xD;
charming woman than her mother.-Mau-&#xD;
rice, have you forgotten that you promised&#xD;
to attend Cox's sale of horses for me this&#xD;
morning?"&#xD;
"Not in the least, sir," Darcy answered,&#xD;
pushing aside the 'Gazette, and giving a&#xD;
glance at his watch; "but there is plenty&#xD;
of time yet, and General Aylmer spoke of&#xD;
going with me."&#xD;
"I am at your service," said the gen-&#xD;
eral, rising as he spoke. "It has been my&#xD;
life-long practice to keep no man waiting&#xD;
&#xD;
my business or pleasure, and I should be&#xD;
sorry to begin at this late day."&#xD;
"Remember that, from two such judges&#xD;
of horseflesh, I shall expect a simply un-&#xD;
paralleled span," said M. Vacquant, as they&#xD;
turned to leave the room.&#xD;
"It would have been wiser to send them&#xD;
apart, then," said Romney, after the two&#xD;
gentlemen were safely out of eai'-shot. "To-&#xD;
gether, their opinions are sure to clash-I&#xD;
never knew two jockeys who didn't-and&#xD;
the result may be any thing but the one you&#xD;
desire."&#xD;
"I should have sent you along as um-&#xD;
pire," said the step-father, a little shortly.&#xD;
"Your judgment served you so well when&#xD;
you bought that showy-looking animal the&#xD;
other week, which turned out just as sound&#xD;
as Maurice prophesied."&#xD;
Julian's cheek flushed darkly, and his&#xD;
bi~ow contracted in its quick frown. There&#xD;
could not possibly have been found a sorer&#xD;
point with him than the 'one to which M.&#xD;
Vacquant alluded - a certain equine pur-&#xD;
chase against which Darcy had strongly ad-&#xD;
vised him, and which proved to be utterly&#xD;
worthless. His reply would probably not&#xD;
have been very, temperate, if his mother&#xD;
had not interfered.&#xD;
"You are hard on poor Julian," she said,&#xD;
reproachfully, to her husband. "I am sure&#xD;
he' 'will give Captain Daroy all the credit he&#xD;
deserves as a jockey; and as for that un-&#xD;
lucky horse-isn't he ever to be left in&#xD;
peaceful disgrace?"&#xD;
"With all my heart," said M. Vacquant,&#xD;
good-humoredly.-" I beg psi-don, Julia;&#xD;
if I have said any thing to. wound: your&#xD;
feelings; and we'll certainly let that de-&#xD;
posed czar rest on his laurels. -Are you&#xD;
engaged this morning, my dear, or can you&#xD;
write some letters for me? There's quite&#xD;
an accumulation of them up-stairs, and the&#xD;
gout in my hand is 'worse than @ver."&#xD;
"Let me be your 'secretary, grandpapa,"&#xD;
Valerie said; but, to her surprise, Madame&#xD;
Vacquant interposed at once.&#xD;
"Quite. impossible,' Your grandfather&#xD;
is accustomed to7 me, and I understand his&#xD;
business. You would only incommode him,&#xD;
and tire yourself. I shall turn you over 'to&#xD;
Julian for an hour or two, and as soon as I&#xD;

&#xD;
give some directions to Pierre, I will be in&#xD;
the library, my dear."&#xD;
"I am in no haste," said M. Vacquant;&#xD;
then, gathering together several letters&#xD;
which had arrived that morning, he left the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Madame Vacquant followed him almost&#xD;
immediately; and, thus forsaken, Miss Ayl-&#xD;
mer and Mr. Roinney looked at each other&#xD;
and smiled.&#xD;
"Yea are given into my hands for amuse-&#xD;
ment," said the latter. "Will you tell the&#xD;
humblest of your slaves what diversion wiLl&#xD;
please you best?"&#xD;
"In the first place, I should like to k-now&#xD;
something of the house I inhabit," she an-&#xD;
swered. "Do you feel inclined to play cice-&#xD;
rone? It may involve another offer of&#xD;
your arm, for my foot is not strong yet."&#xD;
"To hear is to obey, if it involved the&#xD;
offer of my head Shall we set out at once?"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly."&#xD;
She rose and walked slowly down the&#xD;
room. 'By the time the door was reached,&#xD;
his arm had been offered and accepted; and&#xD;
then they set forth, as gayly as a pair of&#xD;
children, on a thorough tour of inspection.&#xD;
It was certainly a very pleasant one.&#xD;
-Beautiful and luxurious appointments,&#xD;
breadth of space, and comfort, unspoiled by&#xD;
economy of arrangement, are charming&#xD;
things to almost any one; and, although the&#xD;
residence of M. Vacquant was by no means&#xD;
extravagantly "palatial," a cultivated and&#xD;
refined taste had breathed into it an individ-&#xD;
uality of aspect which the most gorgeous&#xD;
upholstery rather diminishes than increases.&#xD;
Velvet carpets, damask curtains, tables and&#xD;
ottomans, even pictures and statues, have&#xD;
their money. value, and are at the command&#xD;
of the most uncultured buyer; but the&#xD;
knowledge how to use these things is a dif-&#xD;
ferent commodity, and by no means mark-&#xD;
etable. Whatever else she may have lacked,&#xD;
Madame Vacquant plainly did not lack this&#xD;
-the rare knowledge and rarer artistic ap-&#xD;
preciation which are the very first proofs&#xD;
of eavoir eiere, that a hostess, aspiring to&#xD;
raise her head above the level of or~Hnary&#xD;
hostesses, must give. The most exacting&#xD;
sybarite could hardly have found fault with&#xD;
the arrangement of the rooms, the very air&#xD;
&#xD;
of which inspired thoughts of social ease&#xD;
and social pleasure; and the most sensitive&#xD;
artist could scarcely have suggested a mul-&#xD;
tiplication or abstraction of the well-chosen&#xD;
and well-hung pictures, the costly bronzes,&#xD;
the exquisite statues, or the treasures of&#xD;
ormolu and mavgueterie, that occupied unob-&#xD;
trusive corners, and conducted themselves&#xD;
in all respects like ordinary furniture.&#xD;
When the Whole lower floor had been&#xD;
explored, Valerie led her companion back to&#xD;
the music-room, and bade him ~open the&#xD;
piano.&#xD;
"I am sure you sing," she said, when he&#xD;
had obeyed; "and, if you please, I want to&#xD;
hear you. Ah, there is no good in denial.&#xD;
I flatter myself I know a little of physiog-&#xD;
nomy; and, if yours is not a musical face, I&#xD;
never saw one; besides, you have lived in&#xD;
Germany."&#xD;
"That settles the matter, does it?" said&#xD;
Romney, laughing a little. "Of course, I&#xD;
know something of music-we all did at&#xD;
Jena-but nothing you will care to hear."&#xD;
"Let me be judge of that," she an-&#xD;
swered. "Run your hand over the keys.&#xD;
Ah, yes 1-I knew y~u had a good touch.&#xD;
Do you play much?"&#xD;
"Scarcely at all. Singing is my strong&#xD;
point."&#xD;
"Sing, then."&#xD;
Transcribed, those two words look&#xD;
rather curt; but, given with the expression&#xD;
that Miss ,Aylmer knew excellently well&#xD;
how to infuse-the half-persuasive, half-&#xD;
commanding accent which she possessed to&#xD;
perfection-few' men would have hesitated&#xD;
longer than Romney did about obeying.&#xD;
lie smiled slightly, modulated a few&#xD;
chords, by way of prelude, and began one&#xD;
of those artfully-simple German ballads that&#xD;
the poetry of TJhland and the music of Men-&#xD;
delssohn have made familiar to every ear.&#xD;
The harmonization of the melody was so&#xD;
perfect that; for some moments, Valerie&#xD;
scarcely noticed the voice that rendered it;&#xD;
then, all at once, the consciousness flashed&#xD;
upon her that she had never heard a purer&#xD;
tenor, and, notwithstanding her previously&#xD;
expressed opinion concerning the musical&#xD;
face, she felt herself completely taken by&#xD;
surprise. The natural power, sweetness?&#xD;
&#xD;
and compass of the voice, were remarkable;&#xD;
and as the result, perhaps, of good training,&#xD;
the style was almost perfect-being only&#xD;
sometimes a little strained and marred by a&#xD;
few florid exaggerations. They were very&#xD;
few, however; and, on the whole, his vocal-&#xD;
ization did such entire credit to himself, that&#xD;
V'alerie had no disposition to find fault, but&#xD;
sat in a state of enjoyment which was all&#xD;
the greater for being unexpected, while the&#xD;
rich, clear tones floated on, full and even, to&#xD;
the last cadence. When he finished, she&#xD;
looked up at him reproachfully.&#xD;
"I suppose people never do tell the truth&#xD;
about their own performances," she said;&#xD;
"but that you should speak of singing 'a&#xD;
little,' seems to me sacrilege, or, worse yet,&#xD;
affectation."&#xD;
"Let us consider it sacrilege, then, by all&#xD;
means," he answered. "One aim of my&#xD;
life ha~ been to steer clear of the odium of&#xD;
affectation, and I think I have partially suc-&#xD;
ceeded. People don't often call me affected&#xD;
-unless I forget myself far enough to be&#xD;
natural."&#xD;
"Now you are trying to be cynical."&#xD;
"On my honor, no. Nothing suits me&#xD;
less. And, seriously, I am more pleased&#xD;
than I can say, if you like my singing."&#xD;
"Like it? You must know how weak&#xD;
that expression is-you must know that it is&#xD;
beautifully Sing something else."&#xD;
"What shall it be?"&#xD;
"Some of your student-songs, if you re-&#xD;
member any of them-with a drinking cho-&#xD;
rus, and all that sort of thing. I have al-&#xD;
ways been~ curious to hear how they go."&#xD;
"They go delightfully when you have a&#xD;
*hundred or two voices in the chorus, the&#xD;
beer-cans, and the hurrabs; but how they&#xD;
will sound in solo I can hardly imagine.&#xD;
Nevertheless, you shall hear."&#xD;
And, suiting the action to the word, he&#xD;
burst into one of the ringing student songs&#xD;
that seemed to embody in every note the&#xD;
freshness and enthusiasm, the mirth~ and&#xD;
daring, the gayety and earnestness, of that&#xD;
wonderful Young Germany whose sponta-&#xD;
neous outbursts they were, and whose&#xD;
national lyrics they have become. lIe&#xD;
threw himself into it with a force that was&#xD;
electrifying, and to his listener's ear left&#xD;
&#xD;
nothing to be desired--even in the chorus,&#xD;
where he stopped to assure her that the&#xD;
clashing of wine-cups and swords was ne-&#xD;
cessary, as well as the volume of united&#xD;
voices. "If you could only hear 'The&#xD;
Sword-song' given in that way," he said,&#xD;
when he finished, and she was expressing&#xD;
her approbation- "K~rner's, of courseI&#xD;
mean-and Schiller's 'Trooper's song.' You&#xD;
have heard that, I suppose." And he dashed&#xD;
into itas he spoke:&#xD;
'Up, comrades, and saddle I To horse and away,&#xD;
To the held where freedom's the prize, sirs i&#xD;
There hearts of true metal still carry the day,&#xD;
And men are the kings and the kalsers I"'&#xD;
When the end came, he gave her no&#xD;
time for comment, but rose at once from&#xD;
the piano-scat.&#xD;
"I have done my share," he said;&#xD;
"now it is your turn."&#xD;
But Valerie shook her head.&#xD;
"I don't sing often," she replied-&#xD;
"never in cold blood and bread daylight.&#xD;
Lower the curtains, light the gas, fill the&#xD;
rooms, put me at a fever-heat of social ex-&#xD;
citement, and I may sing for you perhaps&#xD;
moderately well; otherwise, I cannot think&#xD;
of such a thing."&#xD;
"What shall we do, then?"&#xD;
"Is it absolutely necessary for us to do&#xD;
any thing? I like sitting still very well-&#xD;
especially when my ankle pains."&#xD;
"Does it pain now?"&#xD;
"Yes, a little-but pray don't look so&#xD;
niuch concerned. It will soon be better.&#xD;
If you want to make yourself entertaining,&#xD;
you may tell me something about Jena.&#xD;
You can't.imagine what a fancy I have al-&#xD;
ways had for German student-life!"&#xD;
There could be no doubt of the fact that&#xD;
Miss Aylmer's popularity was very easily to&#xD;
be accounted for. By the bright waters&#xD;
and over the fair fields of their own favorite&#xD;
pursuit, or best-loved hohby~ she led her&#xD;
willing victims; giving to each the sweet&#xD;
smile and vivid interest that rarely flagged&#xD;
under any infliction, or had been known to&#xD;
falter in any emergency. It puzzled ordi-&#xD;
nary people-people who had none of this&#xD;
gift themselves~-to linagine how she could&#xD;
possibly adapt herself so readily to so many&#xD;
diverse minds and diverse tastes; but the&#xD;

48                     VALERIE AYLMER.                                              THE GENERAL GIVES A WARNING.             4'7&#xD;
&#xD;
truth really was, that half of it was done un-&#xD;
consciously. It was not that she meant to&#xD;
do it, or even wished to do it; but simply&#xD;
that she could not help doing it. It was&#xD;
her birthright-this chameleon-power of&#xD;
variation, this capability of tuning herseig&#xD;
as it were, to so many keys-and she could&#xD;
no more have explained her own modu8 qc-&#xD;
randi than the most puzzled among the&#xD;
lookers-on. It came natural to her. That&#xD;
was all she knew about the matter. It was&#xD;
the fairy gold which some elfin-power,&#xD;
more malicious than kind, had left beside&#xD;
her cradle; and she scattered it abroad&#xD;
with a lavish unconsciousness of its value-&#xD;
thinking only, caring only, that it won for&#xD;
her the homage which had never yet been&#xD;
missing from her path, and which she&#xD;
thought it would not be possible to live&#xD;
without. Sometimes, when she lookedmost&#xD;
interested, she was, in truth, dreadfully&#xD;
bored; but kindness of heart, as well as the&#xD;
tactics of coquetry, had some effect in teach-&#xD;
ing her that smiling endurance which dis-&#xD;
tinguishes the martyr of society, and both&#xD;
together bore her triumphantly through al-&#xD;
most any ordeal. Neither kindness of&#xD;
heart nor the tactics of coquetry had much&#xD;
to do with the earnest attention which she&#xD;
paid Julian Romney, as he obeyed her last&#xD;
request to the letter, and told her a great&#xD;
deal of his "wandering youth in the far, fair,&#xD;
foreign lands." He talked well, in a pictu-&#xD;
resque, graphic way of his own, and might&#xD;
have engrossed a less interested listener.&#xD;
As he talked, she listened-ever with those&#xD;
eloquent eyes that said more than many&#xD;
words-until her father's voice made her&#xD;
start, and her father's presence suddenly&#xD;
appeared in the doorway.&#xD;
Few people ever learned any thing from&#xD;
General Aylmer's face, but there were one&#xD;
or two signs known only to his daughter,&#xD;
and these told her at once that some serious&#xD;
concern was battling there with grave dis-&#xD;
pleasure. Before she had -time to indulge&#xD;
in a single conjecture, however, he advanced&#xD;
into the room, speaking quite as usual.&#xD;
"Valerie, I am sorry to disturb you, but&#xD;
I have just received a telegram from New&#xD;
Orleans, which necessitates my Immediate&#xD;
departure, and-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"A telegram 1"&#xD;
It was no wonder that the bright cheek&#xD;
grew so pale, or that those two words broke&#xD;
almostunconsciously from the lips. Few fem-&#xD;
inine nerves came so intact out of the four&#xD;
years' agony, as not to quail at that fateful&#xD;
word; and then war had spared her a brother.&#xD;
"Yes, a telegram," said her father, quiet-&#xD;
ly; "but there is no need for being alarmed.&#xD;
It is only Gibson, who telegraphs to me on a&#xD;
matter of business-but I must go at once."&#xD;
"You are sure it is nothing 'about Eu-&#xD;
gene, papa?"&#xD;
"Perfectly sure. But you can see for&#xD;
yourself if you desire."&#xD;
He handed her the well-known form of&#xD;
the telegraph company, filled in with' three&#xD;
or four written words. After reading them,&#xD;
her brow cleared wonderfully, and she&#xD;
looked up quite cheerfully.&#xD;
"I suppose you must go, papa, since&#xD;
you and Mr. Gibson both think so; but it is&#xD;
very provoking. Can't you at least wait&#xD;
until to-morrow?"&#xD;
"I can't wait an hour longer than the&#xD;
first train that leaves southward," the gener-&#xD;
al answered, a little impatiently. "Will you&#xD;
come to my room with me for a few min-&#xD;
utes? I have something to say to you.".&#xD;
Valerie knew her father better than to&#xD;
hesitate about complying with this request.&#xD;
She rose at onceand followed him up~&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
Once there, the general closed the door,&#xD;
and plunged into his subject without pre-&#xD;
liminary.&#xD;
"I have a very short time in which to&#xD;
say any thing, Valerie," he began; "so you&#xD;
need not be surprised, and I hope you will not&#xD;
be offended, if I speak plainly and forcibly.&#xD;
In the first place, I am very sorry t~ ~e&#xD;
that you have commenced a flirtation-or&#xD;
whatever else you choose to call it-with&#xD;
this young Romney."&#xD;
Valerie started and colored, biting her&#xD;
lip half-angrily. She had expected to be&#xD;
taken to task, bait not so soon, and not&#xD;
quite so abruptly. As it was, she was&#xD;
thrown off her guard, and could only take&#xD;
refuge in the thrice-commonplace---&#xD;
"I don't understand you, sir."&#xD;
"Pardon me," her father retorted, '~ but&#xD;
&#xD;
I think you understand me perfectly. Per-&#xD;
haps you dom't understand my reasons for&#xD;
alluding to this, however, so I had better&#xD;
explain them. I never interfere with your&#xD;
amusements, as you know; partly because I&#xD;
have seen that you are perfectly capable of&#xD;
conducting them yourself, and partly be-&#xD;
cause you have never done any serious mis-&#xD;
ehief that I am aware of. A few broken&#xD;
h~jrts, more or less, are of small impor-&#xD;
tance; but let me tell you that you are play-&#xD;
ing here a heavier game than for a broken&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
His voice changed with the last words,&#xD;
and deepened so 'much in earnestness, that&#xD;
Valerie looked at him in simple surprise.&#xD;
Once more she said-this time sincerely-&#xD;
"I don't understand you."&#xD;
The general answered by one, straight-&#xD;
forward question:&#xD;
"What do you propose to yourself by&#xD;
turning this boy's head?"&#xD;
"Really, papa, I have no intention of&#xD;
turning his head."&#xD;
"You have not? Well, then, I wonder&#xD;
you take such a direct means to do it.&#xD;
Come, come, I have no time for feminine&#xD;
fencing. You can answer that question to&#xD;
yourself, if you don't care to answer it to&#xD;
me; but I warn you, solemnly, that you had&#xD;
better stop short in the matter. If ever&#xD;
you played with fire in your life, you are&#xD;
playing with it now!"&#xD;
Valerie looked up a little rebelliously.&#xD;
"If you twill say disagreeable things,&#xD;
papa, I really think you might express them&#xD;
more clearly. What are you afraid of?&#xD;
Surely, not that I will marry lAm?"&#xD;
"No," answered her father, coolly, "you&#xD;
are too ~sensible for that. A pretty face is&#xD;
n~ li*tely to ensnare you, and I don't know&#xD;
that there is any thing else here. The boy&#xD;
seems a mere spoiled 'child, and is said to be&#xD;
very much given to gambling and dissipa-&#xD;
tion besides. Your grandfather plainlydoes&#xD;
not lik~ him; and you would entirely alien-&#xD;
ate him by such a choice. NoIam not&#xD;
afraid of your marrying him-you wrn be&#xD;
tired enough of your toy in less than a&#xD;
week; but the mischief will be done then."&#xD;
"What mischief?"&#xD;
The general was packing his trunk; but&#xD;
&#xD;
he suspended the operation to turn round&#xD;
and look at his daughter.&#xD;
"I am afraid you are growing stupid,&#xD;
Valerie," he, said, quietly. "Is it possible&#xD;
you do not see that, if you bring any harm or&#xD;
suffering to Julian Romney, you make a bit-&#xD;
ter and unscrupulous enemy of his mother?"&#xD;
Miss Aylmer started - then recovered&#xD;
herself and laughed a little.&#xD;
"Why, we are growing quite melodra-&#xD;
matic, papa. People don't have enemies,&#xD;
these days; or, if thty do, they take it out&#xD;
in saying spiteful things about one another.&#xD;
Madame Vacquant reached that interesting&#xD;
stage, as far as I am concerned, long ago,&#xD;
and I don't see what other harm she can do&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Then you know very little of the&#xD;
woman, or of her influence in this house,"&#xD;
said her father, gravely. "She can harm&#xD;
you bitterly, in a hundred ways'; if she has&#xD;
never done so before, it has been because&#xD;
her dislike was more passive than active.&#xD;
Make it active once, and you had better&#xD;
doubt that the sun is in the heavens than&#xD;
that she will work you ill."&#xD;
"I don't see-"&#xD;
"No," he interrupted, impatiently, "it is&#xD;
like a woman never to see, until too late for&#xD;
sight to be of any service. But, remember&#xD;
that I warn you 1-remember, too, that this&#xD;
boy is of somewhat different metal than&#xD;
those you are accustomed to dealing with.&#xD;
If he blows out his brains-"&#xD;
"Oh papa, pray hush!"&#xD;
"Why, you need not be surprised. He&#xD;
looks quite absurd enough to do it. Now,&#xD;
mark me: if you go on with this, it Will be&#xD;
at your own risk, but it is next to impos-&#xD;
sible that the consequences should fall on&#xD;
yourself alone. What do you say? Will&#xD;
you promise me to let the young fellow&#xD;
alone?"&#xD;
He asked the question somewhat doubt-&#xD;
fully; but there was no hesitation in Va-&#xD;
lens's reply. She looked up, and answered&#xD;
readily:&#xD;
"Why did you not ask me that at once,&#xD;
papa, and spare yourself all this long tirade 2&#xD;
Of course, I will promise. There's not the&#xD;
least difficulty about it; for I never meant&#xD;
any thing else than letting him alone. I al-&#xD;

48&#xD;
most feel as if he were a child-quite as if I&#xD;
should take undue advantage of his youth&#xD;
and ignorance, if I made him fall in love&#xD;
with me. Is that all?"&#xD;
"Not quite-" and here the general&#xD;
hesitated before going on: "by-the-way,&#xD;
you have not told me what you think of this&#xD;
Darcy."&#xD;
"Is there any thing to think?" she&#xD;
asked, carelessly. "He seems to me quite&#xD;
a nonentity-muscular, perhaps, but certain-&#xD;
ly not interesting."&#xD;
"Then you are a worse judge of charac-&#xD;
ter than I supposed," said her father, with&#xD;
some perceptible chagrin in his voice. "I&#xD;
confess I was in hopes you had estimated&#xD;
the man more justly. For myself, I was&#xD;
very agreeably disappointed in him-he is&#xD;
thoroughly a gentleman, and one of the&#xD;
most companionable men I have met in a&#xD;
long time.~~&#xD;
"Ah, yes; but then you forget, papa,&#xD;
that you have horses and politics to talk&#xD;
about; while 1 have nothing-besides, he&#xD;
takes no notice of me."&#xD;
"Whose fault is that?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't know-mine perhaps.&#xD;
But I don't- think it matters. I never appre-&#xD;
ciated the full absurdity of grandpapa's pro-&#xD;
posed arrangement, until I saw the object&#xD;
of It. lie is a very good sort of person in&#xD;
his way, I suppose; but I laugh whenever&#xD;
I think of him as a lover."&#xD;
The general looked grave.&#xD;
"What are your objections to him?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
At which question, the demoiselle&#xD;
laughed gayly.&#xD;
"Objections? Why I could not begin&#xD;
to remetnber them. Perhaps I had better&#xD;
sum them all up in one-I don't like him!"&#xD;
"But you scarcely know him."&#xD;
"Qt&amp;amp;'importe? It is all the same.&#xD;
You won't credit it, papa, but these things&#xD;
are matters of instinct, not of reason. I&#xD;
could not tell you why it is that every thing&#xD;
Captain Darcy says and does impresses me&#xD;
disagreeably; but, the fact remains the fact,&#xD;
none the less."&#xD;
She spoke very decidedly; and her fa-&#xD;
thor. turned away, with grave displeasure&#xD;
*in his face.&#xD;
&#xD;
AX1i~4~.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You wrn live to regret all this, Va-&#xD;
lerie," he said. Then he rang the bell for&#xD;
his servant, and, taking the hint, Miss Ayl-&#xD;
mer left the room.&#xD;
An hour or two afterward, the general&#xD;
took his departure, leaving, as his last&#xD;
words to his daughter, when he kissed her&#xD;
good-by-&#xD;
"Remember your promise."&#xD;
-4---&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
A WILFUL WOMAN.&#xD;
Iv view of much that is to be told here.&#xD;
after, it may be well to say now, that Miss&#xD;
Aylmer was perfectly sincere in making the&#xD;
aforesaid promise, nor less sincere in the&#xD;
intention to fulfil it. Even before her fa~&#xD;
other's warning, she had begun to think that&#xD;
it might be as well to keep "hands off"&#xD;
Julian Romney; for she estimated none too&#xD;
strongly the undisciplined passion of which&#xD;
that mobile face was an index, and felt none&#xD;
too truly that of the "lightly-won, lightly-&#xD;
lost" philosophy, this nature was incapa-&#xD;
ble-but after the general had delivered&#xD;
himself, she made a very decided resolu-&#xD;
tion to steer clear of all possible danger or&#xD;
trouble in such a quarter; and, for a time,&#xD;
kept this resolution with a constaney'that&#xD;
did her credit. It was something quite new,&#xD;
and something very tiresome, she found, to&#xD;
be all the time on her guard against making&#xD;
herself too attractive; but still she per-&#xD;
severed in the face of all difficulties, and,&#xD;
by this perseverance, proved conclusively&#xD;
that, of the sin of wilful and deliberate&#xD;
coquetry, her hands were stainless. If, after&#xD;
a while, she yielded to the temptations held&#xD;
out by idleness and levity, and borne on to&#xD;
consequences grievous as any that follow&#xD;
upon premeditated wrong, at least it will&#xD;
be seen that she did not forfeit all claim to&#xD;
compassion, and that she may be allowed a&#xD;
place in the wide ranks of those who have&#xD;
learned, from bitter experience, that it is&#xD;
one thing to sow the seed, and another to&#xD;
reap the harvest; one thing to set a storm&#xD;
in motion, and another to quell it; one&#xD;
&#xD;
A WILFUL WOMAN.                      49&#xD;
&#xD;
thing to loosen a dam, and another' to stop&#xD;
a lisod; one thingto commit folly, end quite&#xD;
another to avert evil. If this story oan be&#xD;
said to contain a moral, it may indeed be&#xD;
compressed into a few words just here: it&#xD;
may be defined as an attempt (not strikingly&#xD;
successful, perhaps) to show how the con-&#xD;
sequences of folly are often as great and&#xD;
wide-spread as the consequences of crime;&#xD;
how no one is so insignificant but that his&#xD;
most thoughtless develictions of duty may&#xD;
prove fruitful of harm and suffering to many&#xD;
besides himself; and how one tiny peb-&#xD;
ble of wrong-doing, cast into the waters of&#xD;
human life, will widen into circle after cir-&#xD;
cle, until human eyes lose sight of its far-&#xD;
thest vibration.&#xD;
For some time after the general's de-&#xD;
parture, matters went on very smoothly,&#xD;
Valerie played her new rile, if not to per-&#xD;
fection, at least very creditably; and there&#xD;
were no more charmed ttite-4-t.~tes, no&#xD;
more fascinating smiles or liquid glances&#xD;
for the puzzled Romney, who found him-&#xD;
self suddenly removed to a ceremonious dis-&#xD;
tance-and kept there. She managed this&#xD;
the more readily, since there was a great&#xD;
deal to be done in the way of preparing for&#xD;
the winter campaign, and Madame V'ac-&#xD;
quant insisted on launching her into the&#xD;
midst of dress-makers and visitors without&#xD;
delay. As for Romney himself, he was&#xD;
enough a man of the world to feel that the&#xD;
barrier thus unexpectedly erected was none&#xD;
the less decided for being quite intangible;&#xD;
and he wasted no useless strength against&#xD;
it. He took the place assigned him, and&#xD;
bided his time-assured that it would come&#xD;
all the sooner for this quiescence. If a man&#xD;
is very much in earnest, such a policy is&#xD;
next thing to impossible to him; yet it is,&#xD;
o~ all policy, the wisest-and so Julian -&#xD;
(who, truth to tell, adopted it sorely against&#xD;
his own will) soon found. Valerie would&#xD;
easily have steeled herself against his efforts,&#xD;
if he had been foolish enough to make any,&#xD;
but the wistful reproach of his eyes was&#xD;
quite another thing, especially when that&#xD;
reproach was seconded by his unexception-&#xD;
able conduct. So, of hey own accord~ she&#xD;
began to thaw a littie-unbending all the&#xD;
more willingly, since she had really taken&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
quite a fancy to him. Not a fancy that was&#xD;
very deep, or that promised to be 6f lon~&#xD;
duration, - but which wtis, - nevertheless,&#xD;
tolerably deeid&amp;amp;I, in the half-patronizing&#xD;
way that women of her stamp ave fond of&#xD;
affecting toward men of his. Indeed, while&#xD;
the gloss of novelty was on him, he in-&#xD;
terested her very much. He had no depth,&#xD;
either of talent or culture-she soon Ais-&#xD;
covered that-but the ~urface was very well&#xD;
polished, and sparkled alittls, indep~ndeutly&#xD;
of the polish. He had no stamina or force&#xD;
of character whatever, and was the soi~t of'&#xD;
person ~ho would, as he grew older, either~'&#xD;
go to the dogs completely, or else 'settle&#xD;
down into commonplace medkcrity. But.&#xD;
while he was young, he had that quickiiess,&#xD;
that somewhat adaptive cleverness, which&#xD;
goes a great way in society, and often gains&#xD;
for its possessor a reputation for talent~ 6r&#xD;
even positive genius, which is deservedithe&#xD;
least in the world. Almost any 'one, of&#xD;
ordinarily keen perception, looking at~ his&#xD;
face, could have read a tolerably accurate&#xD;
horoscope of his future-could have said at&#xD;
once that he would never resolve any thih~&#xD;
with sufficient earnestness for its fulfilment,&#xD;
and, if he ever achieved any thing~ 'would&#xD;
mar it by his own hasty passion or ill-&#xD;
judged action; but tha eyes of youth are&#xD;
not ordinarily of keen perceptio~i, and that&#xD;
face was a very beautiful one. If anybody&#xD;
else at all attractive had ebme across Va-&#xD;
lerie's path just then, she inlght, not~$th-&#xD;
standing her interest in him, have let' his&#xD;
evident tendre&amp;amp;se die of inanitiou; but ther&amp;amp;&#xD;
was literally nobody. Ilatitaine, poor fellow~,&#xD;
had been left behind in Louisiana, aii&amp;amp; all&#xD;
the new acquaintances Which Baltimor.&#xD;
society had thrown into her life were' abs~&#xD;
lute nonentities. It is true there wasDarcy&#xD;
-but, then, Darcy was her abhorrence.&#xD;
And so, perhaps, the convenient abstraction,&#xD;
which we call Fate, waa more, to blame&#xD;
than any one else, as days elided into weeks&#xD;
and the general's caution giew more, and~&#xD;
more dim in his daughter's remembrance.&#xD;
After all, had he not 'been unreasonable in&#xD;
requesting her to "let alone" the' only&#xD;
available x~iaterial f~r am~isement on hand?&#xD;
She began to think so; and then she also&#xD;
began to think that Romney belonged t~&#xD;

h~r, world, and knew as pinch about flirta-&#xD;
t~on a~ she did, and ~was as little likely to&#xD;
be hurt by ~t, ~ etc. After that point&#xD;
w~s, reached, i~ was not difficult to conjec-&#xD;
ture what became of the promise.&#xD;
Meanwhile, it is time that a word or&#xD;
two was said c.on~arning one who is, in a&#xD;
certain sense, the hero yar excellence of the&#xD;
story in progress -i.. e., Maurice Darcy.&#xD;
But let no one fear an analysis of his i~har-&#xD;
acter, or a~ history ~f his life. That charac-&#xD;
ter must speak, for itself in the pages before&#xD;
us, or else it will be hardly worth speaking&#xD;
at all; and that life has little or nothing to&#xD;
do with the position he occupied during the&#xD;
last days of theyear 1865. Notwithstand-&#xD;
ing the uncomfortable perplexities to which&#xD;
ithad given rise, this position was a very&#xD;
simple one. Artist as he was by profession,&#xD;
foreigner as he was by birth and rearing,&#xD;
there had been enough of straightforward&#xD;
heroism about this man to bring him to the&#xD;
aid 4f his mother's country.when that coun-&#xD;
try~was lighting her desperate fight for in-&#xD;
dependence against those overwhelming&#xD;
odda which the civilized world arrayed&#xD;
against her; and enough of enduring forti-&#xD;
tude to keep him in her thinned and starv-&#xD;
ing ranks to the very last. When that last&#xD;
caine- when the Cqnfederacy, with one&#xD;
great death-gasp, sank bleeding and helpless&#xD;
-he was lying wounded and sick in a hospi-&#xD;
tal at Richmond. While there, he fell under&#xD;
the kind care of some exiled Marylanders,&#xD;
and, it was through them that M. Vacquant&#xD;
learned his condition. Now, it chanced&#xD;
that the remembrance of his sister had been&#xD;
fur years the skeleton at the latter's feast of&#xD;
lif~;. and he caught gladly at the opportu-~&#xD;
nity thus offered of reconciliation with her&#xD;
sen. His advances were so eagerly, so al-&#xD;
most humbly made, that it would have been&#xD;
impossible for any but a churl to reject&#xD;
them; and so, by very natural and. simple&#xD;
me Maurice Darey became a guest in his&#xD;
uncle's house. That his stay had length-&#xD;
ened so greatly, was partly the fault of M. -&#xD;
Vacqnsnt, who closed his ears to the least&#xD;
hint of departure; and partly that of his&#xD;
wopnd, which had given him a great deal&#xD;
of trouble; and was only just beginning to&#xD;
heal in a satisfactory way when the year&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER&#xD;
during which, it had been received, was&#xD;
drawing to a close: b~it was not in the least&#xD;
owing to any hopes of heirship, or to 'any&#xD;
desire for a remembrance in that last will&#xD;
and testament which his uncle would one&#xD;
day needto make. Darcy knew very, well&#xD;
that his mother's portion of her father's es-&#xD;
tate had been forfeited when she married&#xD;
against her brother's wishes, but it never&#xD;
occurred to him that even this portion&#xD;
might be his right. He was not a man&#xD;
whose thoughts turned readily to such things&#xD;
-indeed he was a man whom the majority&#xD;
of the world would have counted culpably&#xD;
indifferent to them-and therefore he was&#xD;
slow to appreciate that even lie might per-&#xD;
haps fall under the odium of making mer~&#xD;
cenary calculations. The decision to which&#xD;
NJ. Vacquant had arrived-the decision of&#xD;
giving to him, instead of to Valerie, the&#xD;
prominent place in his will-was entirely&#xD;
unknown to him; as was also the matrizno-&#xD;
nial plan which had so moved Miss Aylmer's&#xD;
indignation. In his own opinion, the, prince.&#xD;
ly revenues of the Viceroy of Egypt, con~&#xD;
cerned him quite as nearly as his uncle's for-&#xD;
tune; an~1 if he yet lingered in Baltimore,&#xD;
instead of plumbing his wings for. distant&#xD;
flight, it was more because one who has&#xD;
been long storm-tossed is apt to like a&#xD;
peaceful harbor, than for any other reason.&#xD;
With regard to Miss Aylmer, he thought&#xD;
so little, that there is little to be said.. He&#xD;
had been prepared to meet her cordially and&#xD;
frankly, as became a kinsman; and she had&#xD;
seen fit to repulse his advances from the&#xD;
very first. Hedid not take the trouble to&#xD;
resent her dislike, but still less did he feel&#xD;
inclined to take the trouble to conquer. it.&#xD;
Difficulty here did not quicken him to exer-&#xD;
tion, as it would have done in any other&#xD;
case, because he saw no result that was&#xD;
worth the gaining; and so he let any&#xD;
chance of obtaining her friendly regard go&#xD;
by default. She was not the kind of wom-&#xD;
an who possessed any attraction for hir~i;.&#xD;
and therefore her good or ill opinion was.&#xD;
very much a matter of indifference to him~&#xD;
.-a fact which, after a while, Valerie her-&#xD;
self perceived. Whether her disposition to&#xD;
coquetry disgusted him, or whether he fan~&#xD;
cied her much more foolish and vain than&#xD;
&#xD;
A WILPU&#xD;
&#xD;
was really the case, she could not tell; but&#xD;
at least it was impossible to doubt that,&#xD;
from some cause or other, her beauty and&#xD;
fascination fell harmless on him. If he ad-&#xD;
mired her, as an abstract work of art, that&#xD;
was quite as far as he went. sometimes she&#xD;
doubted even that. Sometimes a glance of&#xD;
those cool, critical eyes filled her with a cu-&#xD;
rious sense of detected guilt, when she met&#xD;
them in the midst of some fascinating by-&#xD;
play. After a while, she grew rather shy&#xD;
of exercising her arts of coquetry when&#xD;
that quick ear was near at hand, and was&#xD;
obliged to take refuge in commonplaces-&#xD;
conscious that she was held at a disadvan-&#xD;
tage. Of course, none of this made her like&#xD;
Darcy more cordially: on the contrary, she&#xD;
honored him with quite an aversion, and&#xD;
never by any chance spoke to or of him&#xD;
when she could possibly avoid it.&#xD;
Several weeks elapsed before a very mild&#xD;
autumn cameo an end, and Winter an-&#xD;
nounced the beginning of his reign by a fall&#xD;
of snow, which immediately set all the&#xD;
sleigh-bells of the city jingling. Consider-&#xD;
ing her Southern birth and rearing, it was&#xD;
not singular that Valerie should have felt&#xD;
some curiosity to test the enjoyment of this&#xD;
novel amusement, and her face was bright&#xD;
as a sunbeam when she entered the break-&#xD;
fast-room on the morning after the storm.&#xD;
"Your promise, grandpapa 1" she cried,&#xD;
before even the morning greetings were ex-&#xD;
changed. "You have not forgotten it, I&#xD;
hope? The first snow, you said-and the&#xD;
first snow is here."&#xD;
"Of course I have not forgotten it," said&#xD;
M. Vacquant, hissing her, as she bent over&#xD;
him. "A sleigh-ride was it not?-a sleigh-&#xD;
ride you shall certainly have."&#xD;
"Was that all?"&#xD;
"Quite all, I think."&#xD;
"Then I must refresh your memory,~~&#xD;
returned she. "It was a sleigh-ride, un-&#xD;
doubtedly; but it was also the thorough-&#xD;
breds. No, 'you need not try to look sur-&#xD;
prised. I remember it perfectly; and so, I&#xD;
am sure, do ycu."&#xD;
So, indeed, he did-much better than&#xD;
he liked, as his face-rather blank and crest-&#xD;
fallen-said at once. The matter stood&#xD;
thus: the thorough-breds in question were&#xD;
&#xD;
L WOMAN.                             51&#xD;
a pair whioli Darcy and General Ay1~ner&#xD;
had bought at the sale they attended to-&#xD;
gether, on the day of the general's. dep~rt-&#xD;
ure. NJ. Yacquant had been enthusiasti-&#xD;
cally pleased with them, and not without&#xD;
good cause. They were nearly perfect in&#xD;
bone and blood, as beautiful as pictures, and&#xD;
wonderful in their qualities of speed; but-&#xD;
they were by no means safe. They had&#xD;
gone to the hammer on account of a serious&#xD;
accident caused by their running away with&#xD;
their last owner; and Darcy had only pur-&#xD;
chased them because he intended to break&#xD;
them himself. As yet, no one else had tried&#xD;
them, but Valerie looked at them with eyes&#xD;
of desire, and, to silence her importunity, M.&#xD;
Vacquant had promised that, as soon as the&#xD;
first snow fell, she should see what they&#xD;
could do in a sleigh. Perhaps a rash prom-&#xD;
ise was never more heartily regretted than&#xD;
this, when he heard Valerie claim it, and,&#xD;
looking up, met the grave eyes of his&#xD;
nephew.&#xD;
"Enfan4" ho said, uneasily, "I am not&#xD;
sure about this.-Maurice, what do' you&#xD;
think? are the horses sufficiently safe to be&#xD;
trusted?"&#xD;
"I should certainly say not," Darcy an-&#xD;
swered. "I have not taken them out for&#xD;
several days, but I should have been very&#xD;
sorry to have had a lady for my companion&#xD;
then."&#xD;
M. Vacquant turned to his grand-daugh-&#xD;
ter. "You hear that, Valerie I " he said, in&#xD;
the tone of one who considers a matter defi-&#xD;
nitely settled.&#xD;
But so, evidently, Valerie did not regard&#xD;
it.&#xD;
"Yes, I hear, grandpapa," she answered,&#xD;
coolly. "But is Captain Darey always in-&#xD;
fallible? I am sure it seemed to me that the&#xD;
horses were going beautifully, and as quietly&#xD;
as possible, when I saw them 'the other day.&#xD;
At all events, I am not afraid-a~d that is&#xD;
the question."&#xD;
"Pardon me," Darcy remarked," but I&#xD;
cannot agree with you in considering that&#xD;
the question. Your lack of fear would not&#xD;
save you from serious consequences, if those&#xD;
horses behaved as they are likely to do."&#xD;
Valerie turned and looked inquiringly at&#xD;
Romney, who was carelessly sipping his cof-&#xD;

inpilue t~~tb~e side of the rnaligned.-]3e-&#xD;
sides, grandpapa, this is not an open ques-&#xD;
tion-you bavo promised!"&#xD;
Poor M. Vacquant looked genuinely dis-&#xD;
tressed, ~ud did not answer for several&#xD;
minutes. Then he said, doubtfully: -&#xD;
"I can only consent on one condition,&#xD;
Valerie-that Maurice drives you."&#xD;
"I cannot think of ti'oubling Captain&#xD;
Darcy5" said Valerie, coldly. "And I en-&#xD;
tirely question your right to make condi-&#xD;
tions about an unconditional promise. At&#xD;
least I don't mean to imitate your example;&#xD;
for, having promised Mr. Romney that he&#xD;
shall have the perilous honor of driving me,&#xD;
I, mean to keep my engagement."&#xD;
At those words, Romney looked up&#xD;
quickly, with a bright flush of pleasure dye-&#xD;
ing his face, while Darcy's countenance did&#xD;
not change in the least, notwithstanding&#xD;
that something of quiet amusement flickered&#xD;
into the deep-gray eyes. When he spoke,&#xD;
however, it was as courteously and kindly&#xD;
as possible.&#xD;
"I know you would be making a great&#xD;
sacrifice, ~iss Aylmer, in exchanging Juli-&#xD;
an's society f~r mine; buthe must excuse&#xD;
me it; i~or ex~oe,. I press you to do so. I do&#xD;
not mean to question either his nerve or&#xD;
ability, but he has never driven these&#xD;
horses, and therQ is a great deal-almost&#xD;
every thing~..4n a thorough acquaintance&#xD;
between )~orse and driver."&#xD;
"I certainly should not like to take him&#xD;
into danger~'~1 Valerie was beginning,&#xD;
whoRL Julia~i interrupted her.&#xD;
"Exonac me, but that is no question at&#xD;
&#xD;
all. If you would feel more safe under Dar-.&#xD;
cy's care, I should not hesitate a moment to&#xD;
waive any claim which your goodness may&#xD;
allow me; but when you come to consider&#xD;
me-why, then, I have no option but to re-&#xD;
mind you of your promise.&#xD;
Now,, the tone of this pleased Valerie.&#xD;
There was more of straightforward manli-&#xD;
ness, less of boyish petulance, thau was&#xD;
usual with the speaker; so, after giving hini&#xD;
one bright smile, she turned to Maurice.&#xD;
"You hear that, Captain Darcy? Of&#xD;
course, after this, I can do nothing save&#xD;
thank you for your offer, and decline it."&#xD;
Darcy apparently had not expected~ any&#xD;
thing else. At least he did not look at all&#xD;
disappointed, but only said:&#xD;
"Then let me hope you will not insist&#xD;
on driving the thorough-breds. Surely&#xD;
Raven and Falcon may once more be al-&#xD;
lowed the honor of serving you.~~&#xD;
"Yes," said M. Vacquant, eagerly. "I&#xD;
am sure you wrn be reasonable, Valerie."&#xD;
"I hope I am reasonable, grandpapa,"&#xD;
Valerie answered. "But what has reason&#xD;
to do with this? It seems to me that in-&#xD;
timidation is the only argument which has&#xD;
been employed6 Now, I never was intimi-&#xD;
dated into a thing in my life; and as for&#xD;
Raven and Falcon, they may suit Captain&#xD;
Darcy, but they are entirely too fat and lazy&#xD;
to suit me! I must have the thorough-&#xD;
breds-or nothing."&#xD;
It was plain to see that this wasan tilti~&#xD;
matum. The flushed cheek and compressed&#xD;
lip said so, even more plainly than her&#xD;
words; and, with a sigh, N!. Yacquant gave&#xD;
up the point.&#xD;
"You are acting like a child, and a&#xD;
spoiled one, into the bargain, Valerie," he&#xD;
said; "but I suppose you must have your&#xD;
own way.-Julian, I shall look to you for&#xD;
her safety-remember that!"&#xD;
Of course, Juhian made a suitable and be-&#xD;
coming response.; but, after that, conversa-&#xD;
tion sensibly languished. N!. Vacquant&#xD;
seemed to be seriously disquieted; Madan~e&#xD;
Vacquant, though she had i~ot interfered by&#xD;
word' or glance, looked grave; and even&#xD;
Valerie began to feel i~aguely uncomforta"&#xD;
ble,&#xD;
After breakfast this feeling decidedly in-&#xD;
&#xD;
creased. It was not, in the least, one of&#xD;
fear-of that sensation she was physically&#xD;
incapable-but rather one of shame, as if&#xD;
she had extorted some concession to which&#xD;
she had no right, 'besides acting very foolish-&#xD;
ly. If her grandfather only had been con-&#xD;
cerned in the matter, she would certainly&#xD;
have gone to him and offered a compromise;&#xD;
but then-as she steeled herself by think-&#xD;
ing-it was not to him that she would be&#xD;
yielding, but to Maurice Darcy. She thought&#xD;
of his cool, decided advice, and-no-she&#xD;
could not give him this triumph. Any thing&#xD;
else would be preferable! She was on her&#xD;
way down to the library-half-ready to&#xD;
make a sacrifice of her inclination-when&#xD;
this consideration brought her to a sudden&#xD;
pause. It chanced to be just under a richly-&#xD;
stained window, which threw its gules of&#xD;
gorgeous color down from above, making&#xD;
her look like some transfigured picture after&#xD;
the old Italian school, when Maurice Darcy&#xD;
came suddenly upon her. For a moment,&#xD;
he caught his breath-few artists would not&#xD;
have done so, at sight of such rare loveli-&#xD;
ness-and then he advanced directly.&#xD;
"I am glad to meet you, Miss Aylmer,"&#xD;
he said, in his frank way. "I was just&#xD;
coming in search of you. It has occurred&#xD;
to me, since breakfast, that perhaps I did&#xD;
not speak strongly enough to deter you&#xD;
from your intended drive, or to induce you&#xD;
to accept my escort. I sometimes err on the&#xD;
side of ~rusquerie, and I may have done so in&#xD;
this instance. But I beg you to believe the&#xD;
sincerity of my warning and my offer."&#xD;
"I never doubted either," Valerie said-&#xD;
touched despite herself by his tone and man-&#xD;
uer-",and you do yourself injustice when&#xD;
you talk of bru&amp;amp;juerie. I saw nothing what-&#xD;
aver that savored of it. But, in repeating&#xD;
your offer, you forget that I am engaged to&#xD;
~Xr. ~omney."&#xD;
"Julian, I am sure, would not hesitate&#xD;
to release you; and I feel less compunction&#xD;
in urging the sacrifice, than I should if my&#xD;
motive was a selfish one."&#xD;
Perhaps this too candid statement jarred&#xD;
on the ear which had been so long accus- I&#xD;
tomed to flattery's softest accents; at least,&#xD;
Valerie bit her lip as she answered, rather 1&#xD;
coolly:&#xD;
&#xD;
"thank you. But my drive would not&#xD;
give me much pleasure, if I khew that I was&#xD;
victimizing you all the time. Now, Mr.&#xD;
Romney will not regard it so purely in' the&#xD;
light of an unpleasant matter of~ duty.&#xD;
Therefore, I prefer to run a shade more&#xD;
risk with him."&#xD;
"I am afraid you have misunderstood&#xD;
me again," Darcy said; "or else I am very&#xD;
unfortunate about expressing myself. I am&#xD;
sure nothing could be less of~ 'unpleasant&#xD;
duty'than such a service; hind, if "I did not&#xD;
speak of myself in the matter, it was only&#xD;
because I did not fancy that my enjoyment&#xD;
would interest you.~~&#xD;
"Probably, also, you could n~t do so,&#xD;
conscientiously."&#xD;
There was much of sarcasm in the tone&#xD;
which made this amendment; but Darcy&#xD;
ignored it entirely-answering simply and&#xD;
honestly:&#xD;
"You are mistaken. I have not been&#xD;
able to contribute any thing 'to your enjoy-&#xD;
ment hitherto, but nothing would give me&#xD;
more pleasure than to do so now~'&#xD;
The accent of kindly sincerity in his&#xD;
tone conquered, for the moment, Valerie's&#xD;
petulant wilfulness. She felt ashamed of&#xD;
herself; and action was quick upon feeling,&#xD;
with this impulsive nature. The dark eyes&#xD;
looked up with the contrition of' a penitent&#xD;
child in their depths, and the voice, that was&#xD;
never without the music of the sweet South,&#xD;
sounded unusually soft and low when she&#xD;
answered:&#xD;
"Pray pardon me. It is I 'who have&#xD;
been brusque, and, I fear, ungrateful. You&#xD;
are very kind to be concerned about piy&#xD;
safety, and I shall be glad-"&#xD;
Afoot fall, and a soft, rustle of silk, mache&#xD;
ber break off abruptly. The next moment,&#xD;
N!adame Vacquant comedown the staircase,&#xD;
on the lauding of which they st0od.&#xD;
ng them, she paused.'&#xD;
"So Maurice is trying the effect of per~&#xD;
~uasion, since intimida~iou ~faik~," shesaid,&#xD;
with a smile, "and apparently' witli more&#xD;
~ffect. At least I thought I'iiear~i some-&#xD;
~hing about 's~iaIl be 'giamdY-ahdi~wjoor&#xD;
milan's sake, I hope it does ~.ot m~n&#xD;
leaving him in the lurch?"&#xD;
"I have been trying to persuade Miss&#xD;

&#xD;
Ayhner that, for Julian's sake, as well as&#xD;
her own, it would be well to inflict the&#xD;
desolation upon him," Darcy answered, be-&#xD;
fore Valerie could reply. "You will agree&#xD;
with me, I am sure."&#xD;
The lady smiled-that cold, calm smile&#xD;
which never, by an~v chance, warmed into&#xD;
genial expression-and shook her head.&#xD;
* "Perhaps I ought to agree with you,"&#xD;
she said ; ~" but theil, mothers are very fool-&#xD;
ish, and I can't help thinking of poor Juli-&#xD;
an's disappointment. He will feel it so&#xD;
much!"&#xD;
"I-I was thinking more of him than&#xD;
of myself," said Valerie, quickly.&#xD;
"Then I have his reputation for cour-&#xD;
age suflibiently at heart, to beg you not to&#xD;
think of him any more," answered Madame&#xD;
Vacquant. "He would never forgive me if&#xD;
I did n.ot assure you that nothing is needed&#xD;
less than consideration of his safety. Be-&#xD;
sides, I can testify, from personal knowledge,&#xD;
that he is really an excellent whip."&#xD;
"But these horses "-Darcy began.&#xD;
"Encuse me," Valerie interrupted, "but&#xD;
please don't abuse them any more, for my&#xD;
mind is made up. If I am not to consider&#xD;
Mr. Rumney, I am sure I don't consider my-&#xD;
self; so the use of the thorough-breds is .a&#xD;
settled fact. I am much obliged to you&#xD;
for your kind offer to drive me; but a prom-&#xD;
ise given should be a promise kept, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
She bent her head very gracefully at the&#xD;
last words, and, before Darcy could reply,,&#xD;
washalf-wayup the stairs, vanishiuginaflood&#xD;
of purple and golden light. He looked af-&#xD;
ter her for a umment, then turned to Madame&#xD;
Vacquant with a slight shrug of his shoul-&#xD;
ders.&#xD;
"Awilful woman always does have her&#xD;
own way, I believe," he said. "But I&#xD;
confessI am sorry Miss Aylmer is so obsti-&#xD;
nate. ik'r Julian's sake, as well as for her&#xD;
own, it is a pity, madame, that you had not&#xD;
thro~i*n your influence in the other scale."&#xD;
The face before him paled a little.&#xD;
you-~-.do you really think there is&#xD;
any danger I" sh~ asked.&#xD;
"Ithiiikit is a great risk, to say the&#xD;
least. If you could even yct persuade Miss&#xD;
Aylmer.-.&#xD;
&#xD;
"There's not the faintest hope of that,"&#xD;
she interrupted. "You see, for yourself,&#xD;
how spoiled and wilful she is. She is cer-&#xD;
tainly going; and I do not think that, even&#xD;
if I had not spoken, she would have ac.&#xD;
cepted your offer."&#xD;
"She is good enough to honor me with&#xD;
quite a dislike, I know," he answered. "I&#xD;
might be sorry, if I was conscious of ever&#xD;
having done any thing to deserve it; but, as&#xD;
it is, I really have not troubled myself on&#xD;
the subject-feeling sure that I fail in some&#xD;
point which it is out of my power to mend."&#xD;
They were descending the stairs togeth&#xD;
ci', and, at these words, Madame Vacquant&#xD;
looked at him with a slight laugh.&#xD;
"You are wonderfully honest and sim-&#xD;
ple, my dear Maurice," she said. "Is it possi.&#xD;
ble you are really so blind as not to know&#xD;
why Valerie dislikes you?"&#xD;
"How should I know?" he asked, care-&#xD;
lessly. "I take it for granted that she does&#xD;
not fancy ray brus~jvuerie and plainness; but,&#xD;
beyond that, I have not even hazarded a&#xD;
conjecture."&#xD;
"I don't suppose she fancies your stand-&#xD;
ard of gallantry," the lady answered; "but&#xD;
I doubt if she would go to the length of&#xD;
positively disliking it. The truth is-and&#xD;
any one but yourself would long since have&#xD;
seen it-she thinks you may come in for a&#xD;
large share of her fortune."&#xD;
Darcy's eyes opened in the most genu.&#xD;
me astonishment.&#xD;
"For a large share? Why, what have I&#xD;
to do with her fortuiie?" he asked.&#xD;
"Pahaw 1" said his companion, a little&#xD;
impatiently. "I am afraid I must vote you&#xD;
dull as well as honest. Look at the matter&#xD;
yourself; and you will see what you have to&#xD;
do with her fortune; or, rather, with her fu-&#xD;
ture prospect of fortune. She is her grand-&#xD;
father's direct heiress; but you are his&#xD;
nephew, and she evidently fears that your&#xD;
influence over him may result in your shar-&#xD;
ing her inheritance."&#xD;
The words were scarcely uttered before&#xD;
the speaker saw that she had not overrated&#xD;
their probable effect. A dark-red flush&#xD;
surged hotly over Darey's brow, and a quick&#xD;
gleam of haughty indignation flashed into&#xD;
his eyes. Taken by surprise as he was, the&#xD;
&#xD;
insult of such a suspicioninade itself felt at&#xD;
once, and the whole natureof the man rose&#xD;
in arms to resent it.&#xD;
"What does Miss Aylmer consider me ~"&#xD;
he said. "What kind of a dastard does she&#xD;
think it would be who could scheme to rob&#xD;
a woman of her inheritance, without a&#xD;
shadow of claim! She would have paid me&#xD;
a higher compliment if she had suspected&#xD;
ineof open theft!"&#xD;
"Don't be foolish, or I shall be sorry for&#xD;
having told you," said the lady, eagerly.&#xD;
"You know the world, and the ways of it.&#xD;
Every man takes what he can get, by cun-&#xD;
ning or by force; and we judge men, not&#xD;
according to the exception, but according to&#xD;
the rule. Valerie, no doubt, thinks it very&#xD;
natural that you should desire to supplant&#xD;
her in her grandfather's will."&#xD;
"Thinks it natural that I should desire&#xD;
it!" said Darcy, who plainly could not see&#xD;
the force of such an explanation. "Pardon&#xD;
me, madame, but, if she thinks so, it only&#xD;
proves one thing-that nobody ever yet&#xD;
was ~'eady to suspect another of what she&#xD;
was incapable of herself!"&#xD;
They had reached the library-door by&#xD;
this time, and, opening it for her, he saw&#xD;
her in, then bowed, and went his way.&#xD;
At luncheon, every one avoided, with&#xD;
great care, the debatable ground, and it&#xD;
was not until they rose fi'om table that&#xD;
Romney said to Miss Aylmer:&#xD;
"Will threc o'clock suit you as the hour&#xD;
for starting ?-the afternoons are so short&#xD;
now, that we ought not to be later than&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"It ~will suit me quite well," she an-&#xD;
swered, hesitating a moment, as if about to&#xD;
~tdd something else, but, catching Darcy's&#xD;
ey~, she colored and remained silent. After&#xD;
that, nothing further was said, excepting by&#xD;
Madame Vacquant, wholooked up as Vale-&#xD;
rie was leaving the room, and advised warm&#xD;
wrappings. "For I really think we shall&#xD;
have another fall of snow," she said, rising&#xD;
andwalking to one of the windows.&#xD;
Julian followed her, and, while they&#xD;
looked out on the dreary scene, which was&#xD;
made up of snow-covered roof and a leaden&#xD;
sk~r, the mother spoke fast and eagerly:&#xD;
&#xD;
"For God's sake, take care of your-&#xD;
self!" she said, passionately. "My heart&#xD;
begins to misgive me terribly. I scarcely&#xD;
think the end is worth the risk-at least&#xD;
not such a risk as this! If her neck was&#xD;
broken, it would not be much more than&#xD;
she deserves; but for ~~ou-O Julian, Juli~&#xD;
an, promise me that you will not be rash!"&#xD;
Juhian frowned impatiently. No eyes&#xD;
save his had ever seen that pleading look&#xD;
on his mother's face; but he seemed&#xD;
strangely unmoved by it.&#xD;
"Of course I will not be rash," ho said.&#xD;
"I have Miss Aylmer's safety, as well as&#xD;
my own, to think of; you know. I hope&#xD;
you won't be so absurd as to make yourself&#xD;
uneasy, mother-I have told you that there&#xD;
is really no danger in driving the horses.&#xD;
All this talk about their vicious habits is&#xD;
pure braggadocio on Darcy's part, t~ reflect&#xD;
glory on himself."&#xD;
~ she answered. "I know you&#xD;
told me so, or else I should not have inter-&#xD;
fered as I did this morning, when Valerie&#xD;
was on the point of accepting his escort. I&#xD;
have been sorry for it ever, since; I am still&#xD;
more sorry now that the time draws near."&#xD;
"Sorry for it I "-the handsome face&#xD;
was all set and lowering-" you are cer-&#xD;
tainly kind to say that, when you know&#xD;
how much depends on this. I thought you&#xD;
would walk on to your end, over any thing,&#xD;
mother!"&#xD;
"Over any thing but' your safety," the&#xD;
mother answered, shivering slightly. Then&#xD;
she drew back, and said no more.&#xD;
An hour or two later, Pierre, the most&#xD;
dignified and urbane of arzcien-rA~'im# ne-&#xD;
groes, knocked at the door of Darcy's room,&#xD;
and announced the arrival of the sleigh.&#xD;
"Well," said the latter, who was deep&#xD;
in a sketch, "what have I to do with it?&#xD;
Mr. Roinney is the person whom, you&#xD;
should inform of the fact."&#xD;
"Mr. Romney has gone a~wn, sir,"&#xD;
Pierre answered; "but I thought-maybe&#xD;
you meant td see him oft; and so I; niade&#xD;
bold to tell you." .&#xD;
Darcy looked upand read-as a duller&#xD;
man might hate done-~.-a painful anxiety in..&#xD;
the honest, bronze face before him. He re-~&#xD;
membered how long the. ~ld servant had~&#xD;

knp~n~and loved Valerie; and it was char-&#xD;
~a4eistic of th~ man. that he answered as&#xD;
fr~ikly an4 ~kin4ly as ig he had been speak-&#xD;
ing to the best gentleman in the lai~d.&#xD;
"I see wh~t yo~ mean, Pierre~ but~what&#xD;
ea4n F 4~? Literally nothing. Miss Ayhner&#xD;
is determined to be driven by Mr. Romney,'&#xD;
qud alJ'that we can hope is, that the thor-&#xD;
pugh-breds will for once behave them-&#xD;
"You couldn't hope that, if you looked&#xD;
at them, sir," Pierre replied. "I've seed&#xD;
vicious horses in my life, but I never seed&#xD;
*~y thing that looked like these. It's as&#xD;
mnch as t~o boys can do to held 'em now."&#xD;
Darcy's fa~e settled gravely; but he&#xD;
only shook his~head and repeated again:&#xD;
:1 can do nothing." and see 'em off,&#xD;
You can come down&#xD;
end' maybe give them a warning, sir,"&#xD;
Pierre pleaded. "I've seen Mr. Julian&#xD;
drive, and L9rd bee you, sir, Miss Valerie&#xD;
herself can manage the reins as well as&#xD;
him I,'&#xD;
"It would be strange if he did know&#xD;
much about it," Derey muttered. The next&#xD;
moment he was on his way down-stairs.&#xD;
lie found only Jalian and his mother in&#xD;
the hail, for Valerie had not yet made her&#xD;
appearance. Neither was M. Yacquant vis-&#xD;
ible; so, merely .eying.-&#xD;
"I have coma to see you off, Romney,~~&#xD;
he passed on to the outer door.&#xD;
The sleigh-a very light and elegant lit-&#xD;
tle cutter-looked graceful and inviting&#xD;
enough to hqve tempted almost any gaze to&#xD;
linger on it; but Parcy's eye did not do so~&#xD;
aven for a moment. His glance settled on&#xD;
the b.er~es, and he recognized at once the&#xD;
justice e~ ~'ierre's judgment. They were in-&#xD;
deed so restive that it required all the&#xD;
strength of two grooms to keep them still,&#xD;
and, if there was any teuth in the warning of&#xD;
eye or movement, they meant mischief, as&#xD;
surely as thos~ firm hands were once taken&#xD;
~ft~enm ~their $ts.&#xD;
"They're awful bad to-day, sir," oneof&#xD;
~the men an ,jtouehinghiacapas h~ caught&#xD;
Thirey~s eye.,- iitp'xaps a hand like your'n&#xD;
may do 'em some goo4. ~I have never seen&#xD;
'~n po fractions b~forpthQugh."&#xD;
"I am not going to drive them," Mau-&#xD;
&#xD;
rice answered, shortly; and, as be spoke, a&#xD;
light, silvery voice in his rear cried gayly,&#xD;
"Oh, what beautiful creatures!" And the&#xD;
next moment he drew aside to let Miss&#xD;
Aylmer pass. She was looking radiantly&#xD;
lovely in her close-fitting velvet jacket and&#xD;
becoming ermine furs. So, when she&#xD;
paused, he felt his face relaxing in spite of&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"Won't you at least give me a lion von-&#xD;
age, Captain Darcy?" she said, with a&#xD;
bright smile. "I am sorry to seem so dread-&#xD;
fuUy obstinate, but I am sure nobody could&#xD;
ever plead a greater temptation thanthat;"&#xD;
and she pointed to the horses, whose spir-&#xD;
ited heads, and curving necks made a very&#xD;
attractive picture just then.&#xD;
"Eon eoyage, with all my heart," Darcy&#xD;
answered, "and I trust sincerely that I may&#xD;
prove the most unreliable prophet in the&#xD;
world. May I put you in th~ sleigh?"&#xD;
She looked back, and, seeing that her&#xD;
grandfather was holding fast the impatient&#xD;
Julian, nodded assent, and extended her&#xD;
hand. The next moment she was ensconced&#xD;
in the deep, luxurious seat, and Darcy&#xD;
was drawing the buffalo-robes well round&#xD;
her, when Julian came up and sprang in.&#xD;
While he gathered up the reins, the other&#xD;
found time for one last caution.&#xD;
"Be sure and keep a firm, steady rein on&#xD;
them, Romney; never relax it for one&#xD;
moment, although there are some things&#xD;
plensanter on the arms. I would not advise&#xD;
you to begin any very interesting conversa-&#xD;
tion, either; for they need constant watch-&#xD;
ing. If they once take the bits between&#xD;
their teeth, turn the sleigh over in the first&#xD;
drift you come to-any thing will be better&#xD;
than leaving yourselves at their merey~ end&#xD;
yen are not likely to 'stop them. I hope all&#xD;
will go well, however.-I~Tow, let go their&#xD;
heads, 'boys."&#xD;
The grooms fell back on each side, and&#xD;
the same instant, with a bound that nearly&#xD;
draggedJulian from his seat, the thorough..&#xD;
breds were off,&#xD;
As, they whirled out of sight, around the&#xD;
sharp corner of the street, all that conld be&#xD;
seen was the hand which Valerie wave4&#xD;
over ,the hack of the sleigh in triumphant&#xD;
~enjoyment.&#xD;
&#xD;
Darcy watched them with suspended&#xD;
breath, as long as they were visible. When&#xD;
they vanished, lie turned round, and per-&#xD;
ceived his umde Atanding on the steps, with&#xD;
a very disturbed face.&#xD;
~ he said, anxiously, "I wish&#xD;
I had not allowed this I-I wish I had inter-&#xD;
fered even a moment ago. Surely you see&#xD;
that that boy will never be able to control&#xD;
those horses?"&#xD;
"You could easily have prevented his&#xD;
attempting it, sir," Darcy answered, dryly;&#xD;
for in truth he felt very little sympathy with~&#xD;
the weakness which M. Vacquant ha7l so&#xD;
conspicuously displayed.&#xD;
"I know !-I know !-" the other said,&#xD;
impatiently. "I was very foolish to allow&#xD;
it; but it won't save Valerie, that I recog-&#xD;
nize the fact now.-Maurice, for God's sake,&#xD;
follow them, and try to do something!"&#xD;
Maurice shrugged his shoulders. Ft cer-&#xD;
tainly seemed rather singular that, after dis-&#xD;
regarding all his advice, M. Vacquant should&#xD;
now implore his aid; but perhaps the re-&#xD;
quest tallied with his own desire-at all&#xD;
events, he only answered, by turning to one&#xD;
of the grooms, and saying:&#xD;
"Bring Bayard out at once. Don't&#xD;
waste time about it, for I will be down&#xD;
again in a minute."&#xD;
In little more than that time, he was&#xD;
mounted, and galloping after the sleigh.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
DERRING-DO.&#xD;
MuAvwmLn, the thorough-breds were&#xD;
behaving so well that, as they whirled into&#xD;
the park-gates without having met with any&#xD;
misadventure, Julian could not forbear a&#xD;
sneer on the absent horseman, who was just&#xD;
then cantering down Garden Street toward&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"You see now how much season there&#xD;
was for Darcy's fears; and how much prob-&#xD;
able trulili in his representations of danger.&#xD;
Tho horses are certainly spirited, 'but as for&#xD;
the rest-it was nonsense, to say the least&#xD;
of it! We can make allowances, however,&#xD;
&#xD;
'for the weaknesses of athletic nature. There&#xD;
really is no creature alive so vain of muSCu-&#xD;
lar repute as your would-be 'plunger."'&#xD;
lie spoke with more bitterness than Va-&#xD;
lerie fancied; but, as she herself was very&#xD;
much reassured by the good behavior of the&#xD;
horses-she could not see the vicious devil&#xD;
in their eyes, which only waited a suitable&#xD;
opportunity, or plausible pretext, for exhibi-&#xD;
tion-she, too, began to entertain very much&#xD;
the same opinion of Darcy's warning. So,&#xD;
she did not utter any rebuke, but only said,&#xD;
with a laugh:&#xD;
"He probably wanted to keep the en-&#xD;
joyment and the glory all to himself. I can&#xD;
scarcely blame him-they do go so delight-&#xD;
fully I-but still he need not have made&#xD;
me feel as uncomfortable as I have felt all&#xD;
They were skimming down? one of the&#xD;
snow-covered roads which branched to the&#xD;
right from the main entrance, when she&#xD;
said this, and Julian repeated her words at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
"Uncomfortable all day! I am very&#xD;
sorry to hear that, and-surprised too. I&#xD;
did not think you would have let him influ-&#xD;
ence you, and "-a sensible lowering of the&#xD;
voice-" I thought you might perhaps have&#xD;
felt some reliance on me."&#xD;
"I don't know that he influenced me-&#xD;
that is, made me afraid," she answered,&#xD;
nonchalantly; "at least if only myself had&#xD;
been concerned, I am sure I should not&#xD;
have hesitated a moment; but I felt rather&#xD;
ashamed of insisting on a mere caprice, and&#xD;
I began to be a little apprehensive lest I&#xD;
might be taking you into danger.~~&#xD;
Words conld not have been uttered in a&#xD;
more matter-of-fact tone than these last,&#xD;
yet they brought a warm light into Rom-&#xD;
ney's face, and a yet warmer tone into his&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"You were very good to tl4k of me,"&#xD;
he said. "To be so considei'ed,, I fe~i' I&#xD;
should hesitate very little over real dangei~.&#xD;
I am almost sor~y that there is none in this&#xD;
-thtit I might prove to you how much I&#xD;
would do to ~ratify even a 'caprice" of&#xD;
yours."&#xD;
"I am sure you are doing a great deal,"&#xD;
she said, cordially. "Captain Darcy 'would&#xD;

&#xD;
ta~re yon to task.very severely for speaking&#xD;
~o diareapeetfully of our present enterprise ;&#xD;
and, whether or not there is danger in it,&#xD;
there is at least risk enough to make me&#xD;
grateful for your willingness to give me&#xD;
.pleasure."&#xD;
"I would empty my veins to do that!"&#xD;
he, answered, with a touch of the boy's&#xD;
high-flown exaggeration, yet enough of the&#xD;
man's earnestness to fire Za ?elle des 1)ellee&#xD;
with the spirit of her favorite sport.&#xD;
"Pshaw! " she said, with the saucy&#xD;
smile of half-challenge, half-defiance, which&#xD;
had turned more heads than a few. "It is so&#xD;
easy to make professions-especially when&#xD;
there is not the least danger of beizig taken&#xD;
seriously... You had better rest contented&#xD;
on your laurels; for there's always risk in&#xD;
giving a carte Idaneke of that sort to fem-&#xD;
inine vanity. I might be tempted to make&#xD;
a heavy draft on your daring."&#xD;
"Draw to any amount, and see if it be&#xD;
not promptly honored," he replied, readily,&#xD;
for his had been a very fair flirtation train-&#xD;
ing before this.&#xD;
Miss Aylmer shook her head.&#xD;
"I beg you won't tempt me, for I am so&#xD;
strongly warned by the past. More times&#xD;
than I would like to count, I have been on&#xD;
the eve of bestowing my favor on some&#xD;
~allant knight .who called all the gods to&#xD;
witness that he was wholly 8~fl8 peur, hut&#xD;
when the test came-well, then I found&#xD;
exactly what I said a moment ago, that&#xD;
professions are easy to make, and hard to&#xD;
fulfil. Therefore, I have grown rather in-&#xD;
credulous, and- Oh!"&#xD;
The exclamation was uttered very sud-&#xD;
denly, for a deer bounded across their path,&#xD;
and the horses gave a simultaneous bolt, a&#xD;
rush, and then indulged in a rearing which&#xD;
tested all the strength of Romney's wrists.&#xD;
Valerie sat quite still, making neither sign&#xD;
nor sound while the short battle lasted;&#xD;
but after a moment the thorough-breds&#xD;
proved that they had not meant serious&#xD;
business. They settled down to their stride&#xD;
again, and then Julian looked round at his&#xD;
companion with a flash of not unnatural tri-&#xD;
umph in his eyes.&#xD;
"lou see how easily they are managed,"&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I see how. wise I. was in placing myself'&#xD;
under your protection," answered Valerie;&#xD;
who knew better than any woman living&#xD;
when and how to compliment. "I d~uht&#xD;
whether Captain Darcy could have brought&#xD;
them to terms any sooner, or probably half&#xD;
as soon. I can well believe that any draft&#xD;
on your daring would be promptly hon-&#xD;
ored."&#xD;
"Then-in view of the promised reward&#xD;
--may I hope that you wrn speedily make&#xD;
She looked up with a smile.&#xD;
"Don't be foolish, please. Who talked&#xD;
of reward I"&#xD;
"You did-when you spoke of the favor&#xD;
that has never yet been won."&#xD;
"Ah, but perhaps you think this favor&#xD;
something greater than it really is. Would&#xD;
you do much for thisI"&#xD;
She touched, as she spoke, a knot of rib-&#xD;
bon that fluttered at her throat; and, watch-&#xD;
ing the hand which made the gesture, Rom-&#xD;
ney answered quickly:&#xD;
"I would do anything!"&#xD;
"Then perhap.~, some day, I will set you&#xD;
a deed of derring-do," she said, gayly.&#xD;
"These are my colors, that I have never yet&#xD;
given any one the right- A-h!"&#xD;
This was rather a prolonged gasp than&#xD;
an exclamation, and there was good cause&#xD;
for it. Lulled into carelessness by the ease&#xD;
with which he had mastered the horses a&#xD;
few moments before, Romney had forgotten&#xD;
Darcy's caution against ~entering into any&#xD;
very interesting conversation; and, listening&#xD;
eagerly to Valerie, he had paid little atten-&#xD;
tion to them. Nothing~ perhaps, is so quick&#xD;
of perception, as a horse; and, when the&#xD;
restive thorough-breds felt those slackened&#xD;
reins upon their backs, there was but one&#xD;
thought between them-" Now is our time."&#xD;
A jingling sleigh that glided past, laden&#xD;
with a merry crew of school-girls, gave a&#xD;
color of excuse to the frantic bound which&#xD;
threw Valerie violently back, and nearly&#xD;
jerked the ,reins out of Romney's hands.&#xD;
The next moment the bits were between'&#xD;
their teeth, their heads were downy and&#xD;
they were off.&#xD;
l~ow, although none of it is very pleas-&#xD;
ant, there are great differences in the differ-&#xD;
&#xD;
ent modes of running away. There is the&#xD;
foolish horse, who, having a chronic distrust&#xD;
of white logs, cows, sheep, and children,&#xD;
loses his head entirely at sight of any of&#xD;
these objects, and runs from pure and simple&#xD;
fear. There is the gamesome horse, who is&#xD;
fond of his own joke, and runs away when-&#xD;
ever he sees a good chance of frightening&#xD;
anybody, or doing a limited ai~iount of dam-&#xD;
age. There is the passionate horse, who&#xD;
gets angry occasionally, and asserts his dig-&#xD;
nity by committing a good deal of mischief,&#xD;
but who is easily amenable to reason. And,&#xD;
lastly, there is the vicious horse, in whom&#xD;
no wise man will ever put trust, who is&#xD;
ruled onfy by the strong hand, and whose&#xD;
outbreaks invariably mean serious harm to&#xD;
every one concerned.&#xD;
The merest child, looking at them now,&#xD;
could not have doubted to which of these&#xD;
classes the thorough-breds belonged. That&#xD;
wild rush had little of genuine fright in it;&#xD;
but the glaring eyes and distended nostrils&#xD;
-more than all, that fatally significant&#xD;
clamp of the iron jaws-promised little hope&#xD;
of checlelng them. Perhaps Julian realized&#xD;
this as fully as need be; but he clung to the&#xD;
reins with desperate energy, nevertheless.&#xD;
Bracing his feet against the front of the'&#xD;
sleigh, he twined the lines many titles round&#xD;
his hands, and brought all his strength to&#xD;
bear. It was not verymuch; but, if it had&#xD;
been that of Hercules, it would have availed&#xD;
all the same; for the staunchest muscles&#xD;
alive might as well have pulled against&#xD;
stone. Of control over their movements&#xD;
he had not so much as a pretence. He felt&#xD;
this with horrible force, as Darcy's last&#xD;
words recurred to him; and he saw that he&#xD;
could not even guide them sufficiently to&#xD;
follow his advice and capsize the sleigh.&#xD;
There was prospect, indeed, that the speed&#xD;
which sent it dashing from side to side of&#xD;
the road, would eventually do this; but&#xD;
there was little consolation in such a hope,&#xD;
since the fall of snow had been so light that&#xD;
drifts were few and the ground not more&#xD;
than barely covered. They were whirling&#xD;
down a steep declivity, with a narrow bridge&#xD;
before them, when he turned and looked at&#xD;
Valerie. She had not uttered 'a sound, or&#xD;
made a movement since her first exclama-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion some time before; but s.lthough her&#xD;
face was as pale as possible, the dark eyes&#xD;
met big calmly and steadily. There must&#xD;
have been something reassuring in their&#xD;
gaze, for the next juBtant they flashed over&#xD;
the bridge-how neither of them ever knew&#xD;
-and then Julian said, quite coolly:&#xD;
"This must end soon. They will either&#xD;
throw us out, or-"&#xD;
The words were cut short suddenly, as&#xD;
the sleigh was hurled headlong against a&#xD;
post that marked the boundary of the road,&#xD;
the tense reins broke with a loud snap, as of&#xD;
a whip, and Julian was shot headforemost&#xD;
out a distance of at least twenty yards. It&#xD;
all passed with the rapidity of a flash of&#xD;
lightning. Valerie had barely time for one&#xD;
gurgling cry-barely time for one glimpse&#xD;
of the figure that lay motionless where~ it&#xD;
had fallen at the foot of a tree-when she&#xD;
was whirled out of sight and away.&#xD;
After this she had very little idea of any&#xD;
thing that occurred, or very little fear for&#xD;
any result. She knew that the horses were&#xD;
shaping their course down the main avenue,&#xD;
and, unless they were stopped at the gate,&#xD;
would. soon be in the open highway; but&#xD;
this, which meant certain destruction to her-&#xD;
self, scarcely dwelt on her mind an instant&#xD;
-she. was too absorbed in wondering&#xD;
whether Julian was killed; too much ab-&#xD;
sorbed in picturing over and over that .last&#xD;
awful sightof him. Strange as it may seem,&#xD;
she did not even pray. "My fault! my&#xD;
fault!" were the only words that rang&#xD;
through her brain, while the familiar forms&#xD;
of supplication seemed to have faded far&#xD;
away from her recollection. Me9hakkioally&#xD;
she unclasped a small rosary fron~er wrist,&#xD;
but even the names "Jesus" and "Mary"&#xD;
caine faintly and slowly, as from palsied lips.&#xD;
It was only when she saw before her the&#xD;
open gates and the massive blocks of granite&#xD;
that were scattered before it-~-only when&#xD;
she realized that there, in all probability,&#xD;
would be the end at once of life and beauty&#xD;
-did she find voice for one cry which we&#xD;
must all sooner or later make, "God have&#xD;
mercy on me!" Then she closed her eyes,&#xD;
and waited for the end.&#xD;
l~Tow it chanced that the thorough-breds&#xD;
having made better time than even he had&#xD;

&#xD;
counted on, Darcy had only just paused at&#xD;
the arched entrance to question a loitering&#xD;
policeman whether the object of his search&#xD;
had entered before him, when the runaway&#xD;
horses came thundering into sight, dragging&#xD;
behind them the sleigh, which bounded to&#xD;
and fro like a living thing in agony.&#xD;
"By G-d, there's the very team you're&#xD;
asking after, now!" cried the man, excited-&#xD;
ly, recognizing at once the handsome chest-&#xD;
nuts he had admired so much as they swept&#xD;
past him with their long, swinging trot,&#xD;
half an hour before. "Stand out of the&#xD;
way, sir-it's more'n a man's life's worth to&#xD;
try to stop "em now! "&#xD;
But Darcy did not heed the admonition.&#xD;
He only stood up in his stirrups and looked&#xD;
forward with a quick, eager gaze-a gaze the&#xD;
meaning of which the policeman at once un-&#xD;
derstood, for be looked too, and then said,&#xD;
rapidly:&#xD;
"You're i~ight, sir-the sleigh's empty.&#xD;
That's something to be thankful for-there&#xD;
was as pretty-"&#xD;
"I can't tell," muttered Darcy between&#xD;
his teeth. "If I could only see-"&#xD;
* "~tand back, for your life!" shouted&#xD;
the other, his anxiety getting the better of&#xD;
his fear, so far that he even rushed at Bay-&#xD;
ard's bridle and drew him out of the path&#xD;
of the horses now charging down upon&#xD;
them. But to his utter amazement, as he&#xD;
did so, Darcy was out of the saddle-the&#xD;
next moment he rushed full at the thorough-&#xD;
breds and grasped their bits.'&#xD;
Of course he did not stop them-no mor-&#xD;
tal hands could have done that-but he&#xD;
swufig to them desperately, and the police-&#xD;
man saw him dragged past at the same mo-&#xD;
ment that he recognized a woman's presence&#xD;
inthe sleigh. That honest guardian of the&#xD;
peacenever had any very clear remembrance&#xD;
of what ensued. He only recollected swear-&#xD;
inga great oath in sheer astonishment, and&#xD;
letting Dayard go about his own devices,&#xD;
whflehe ran full tilt aft~r'tlio sleigh, withn~&#xD;
ulterior intentions Whatever. The next mo-&#xD;
mont, he saw something which brought him&#xD;
to a horrified pause. Although he had been&#xD;
dragged several yards, bleeding and half-&#xD;
stunned, Darcy had never once relaxed his&#xD;
hold upon 'the bits-if he had done soit&#xD;
&#xD;
would have been all over with him, as well&#xD;
as with Valerie, atid after a while he strug-&#xD;
gled to his feet. Then, breast to breast, be-&#xD;
~an one of the most awful sights in this&#xD;
world-the 'sight of man against brute!&#xD;
The horses were quite beside themselves, by&#xD;
this time, and seemed possessed of a strength&#xD;
tenfold their own as they reared and plunged&#xD;
against the iron muscles that held their&#xD;
'heads. The sleigh swayed to~ and fro, like&#xD;
a wicker-basket, with their frantic struggles,&#xD;
while the wild, glancing eyes and foaming&#xD;
mouths made a strange contrast to the man's&#xD;
face, which was set in the rigidity of marble.&#xD;
The contest was so unequal, that it could&#xD;
only have ended in one way, and that very&#xD;
speedily, if the policeman had not gathered&#xD;
his senses sufficiently to run forward when&#xD;
he saw the progress of the horses once fairly&#xD;
arrested. With his help, they were at&#xD;
length brought to a panting and exhausted&#xD;
stand. Then Darcy staggered back, and sat&#xD;
down on a block of stone, pale and gasp-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"I'm afraid the brutes have hurt you&#xD;
badly, sir," the former said, respectfully.&#xD;
He could scarcely bring himself to pity the&#xD;
man whose pluck had fought such a good&#xD;
fight.&#xD;
But Darcy only shook his head; and, ris-&#xD;
big after a moments walked to the side of&#xD;
the sleigh, where he found Valerie, as he&#xD;
had half-expected, too weak from the mere&#xD;
physical reaction to think of moving. ~he&#xD;
looked so white, that he thought at first she&#xD;
might be about to faint, but the tone of her&#xD;
voice reassured him-it was perfectly firm&#xD;
and steady, although strangely tense and&#xD;
unnatural.&#xD;
"I am glad you were not killed, too,"&#xD;
she sald. "But we must not walt here a&#xD;
moment. We muet go back to-him!"&#xD;
"Do you mean 5ulian?" Darcy asked,&#xD;
startled into a sudden fear by her tone and&#xD;
manner. "Where is he?"&#xD;
He was scarcely surprised, and a little&#xD;
reassured, at hearing all that she knew.&#xD;
After hearing it, he did not waste any time&#xD;
in comment. He only lifted her from the&#xD;
sleigh-disencumbering her of the many&#xD;
wrappings which had probably saved her&#xD;
life by keeping her fast-and asked if she&#xD;
&#xD;
could show him the place where Romney&#xD;
had been left. She assented, eagerly, and,&#xD;
after sending a mounted, messenger to town&#xD;
for a carriage, he was about to Bet forward,&#xD;
when a sleigh, that had been jingling up the&#xD;
avenue for some inmates, paused beside&#xD;
them, and a gentleman sprang hurriedly&#xD;
out.&#xD;
"Darcy!" he said, quickly, "this is bet-&#xD;
ter luck than I expected. See here I-we've&#xD;
picked up Romney, and I fear he is badly&#xD;
hurt."&#xD;
"Only hurt!" repeated Darcy, hearing&#xD;
Valerie's sudden gasp at his side. "Only&#xD;
hurt, then?"&#xD;
"Only hurt, certainly-not killed, if you&#xD;
mean that. But I don't like the look of&#xD;
him. He is either stunned, or he has fainted&#xD;
very dead away."&#xD;
Darcy put Valerie down on a block of&#xD;
stone. "You had better stay here," he said;&#xD;
and, without giving her any time for ex-&#xD;
postulation, he strode away at once to the&#xD;
sleigh.&#xD;
"He must have received a severe blow&#xD;
on the head," he said, after looking at Rom-&#xD;
ney's pale, insensible face, and feeling his&#xD;
pulse. "I am afraid it may prove to be&#xD;
concussion of the brain; but, of course, I&#xD;
can~ tell. We must get him home, and into&#xD;
a doctor's hands, as soon as possible. Do&#xD;
you think any bones are broken?"&#xD;
* "I fancy one arm is-at least he moaned&#xD;
when we touched it, and it hangs like a&#xD;
fractured limb."&#xD;
"Which arm?"&#xD;
"The right."&#xD;
Darcy leaned over and touched it gently,&#xD;
but with all his care he brought forth a low&#xD;
moan of pain, and the eyes opened for a mo-&#xD;
ment, but closed again immediately.&#xD;
"I don't think there's a doubt of its&#xD;
being broken," he said. "How did you&#xD;
chance to find him?"&#xD;
"He was lying immediately on the side&#xD;
of the road," the, other answered. "Arle&#xD;
saw him at once."&#xD;
"Arle was with you?"&#xD;
"Yes-to his cost. You know how he&#xD;
hates walking, ~nd he is, footing it home-&#xD;
ward now. I suppose he will reach the gate&#xD;
here about dark. I~fow, what is to be done&#xD;
&#xD;
with this poor fellow? Shall I take him&#xD;
home, or will you?"&#xD;
"I would, ask you to take hira on ~t&#xD;
once, if it were not for 'his mother," said&#xD;
Darcy. "Somebody ought to prepare her,&#xD;
and it is impossible for me to leave Miss&#xD;
Aylmer here alone."&#xD;
"Pray don't think of met" said Va-&#xD;
lerie, who had come forward unperceived&#xD;
by either of them. "I will stay here-any-&#xD;
where-sooner than keep you a moment.&#xD;
Captain Darcy, pray go!"&#xD;
"Unfortunately I forgot, when I spoke&#xD;
of doing so, that my horse has been sent&#xD;
away," Darcy answered. "Thornton, I sup-&#xD;
pose there's nothing for it, but to let you&#xD;
take him on. They will be partly at least&#xD;
prepared, by my sending for the carriage.&#xD;
At all events, we have no right to risk de-&#xD;
lay."&#xD;
Thornton-a pale, slender, keen-faced&#xD;
man-evidently thought the same thing.&#xD;
So he sprang into the sleigh, laid Julian's&#xD;
head as comfortably baek as he could, and,&#xD;
in a moment more, whirled out of sight.&#xD;
Then Darcy, turning round, discovered&#xD;
two facts: the first, that snow had been fall-&#xD;
ing for some time; the second, that Miss&#xD;
Aylmer looked almost as pale as the boy&#xD;
who had just been sent away. Now, there&#xD;
never was a man who had less sympathy&#xD;
with any form of caprice or coquetry, than&#xD;
this brave, simple "straight-goer," and of&#xD;
both he held V~Ierie so guilty that only a&#xD;
moment before his heart had been wholly&#xD;
steeled against pity for any suffering of hers;&#xD;
but now it melted suddenly at sight of her&#xD;
wan face and sad eyes, and he said, kindly&#xD;
and cordially:&#xD;
"I fear I have forgotten how ,c~ld and&#xD;
tired you must be. Let me take youto the&#xD;
sleigh, and wrap you up4 That will be some&#xD;
protection until the carriage comes."&#xD;
She held out her hand without a word--&#xD;
he could not help remembering~ how di1~'er~&#xD;
ently, an hour or two before, she had ex-&#xD;
tended it for the same purpose-and let hint&#xD;
take her and cover her up under the af-&#xD;
ghans and buffalo-robes. Then she leaned&#xD;
back, gtill quite silently, while he went up&#xD;
to the policeman, who held the thorou~h~&#xD;
breds-now safely out of harness-.~.aud re-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8073-00000032"/>&#xD;
62                           VALERTh&#xD;
turned his thanks both verbally and sub-&#xD;
stantially. After a while he came back, and&#xD;
asked Valerie if she felt very cold.&#xD;
"Not cold at all-you have covered me&#xD;
so well," she answered. "I am truly&#xD;
ashamed not to have asked you before, but&#xD;
I hope you are not much hurt?"&#xD;
"I! Oh, no," he said, with a smile. "I&#xD;
am cast-steel-warranted not to break or&#xD;
injure under any provocation."&#xD;
"I hope you will never need to do such&#xD;
a thing again," she said, with a shudder.&#xD;
"It was horrible !-~--I seem to see it yet!&#xD;
And-and I have not thanked you."&#xD;
"I trust you will not think of doing&#xD;
so," he replied, quickly. "Pray don't fancy&#xD;
yourself under obligations, or any thing of&#xD;
that kind. I hope I should have done the&#xD;
same for anybody."&#xD;
"I don't doubt that," she answered;&#xD;
"but it should not lessen my gratitude that&#xD;
I chanced to be the person whom you&#xD;
saved."&#xD;
Involuntarily, as it seemed, Darcy&#xD;
frowned a little.&#xD;
"win you pardon me if I repeat that&#xD;
such a word does not apply to me in the&#xD;
least?. I could not have 'saved' you if our&#xD;
friend yonder had not been at hand; or if&#xD;
the horses had not been nearly spent."&#xD;
At another time, Valerie would doubt-&#xD;
less have felt and resented thls repulse; but&#xD;
now she looked up almost appealingly.&#xD;
"At least, then, you will let me ask you&#xD;
to forgive the folly and wilfulness which&#xD;
caused all this?"&#xD;
It was an unfortunate question-for,&#xD;
gentleman as he was to the core, and&#xD;
mailed in all gentlemanly courtesy, Darcy&#xD;
could sometimes speak an abrupt home-&#xD;
truth very sharply. Now he answered al-&#xD;
most without thought:&#xD;
"It is scarcely my forgiveness that you&#xD;
should ask, Miss Aylmer. I have not suf-&#xD;
fered for the gratification of your whim, as&#xD;
that poor boy whom we sent home has&#xD;
done, and will yet do."&#xD;
The next moment he felt sorry for hav-&#xD;
ing so spoken-sorry when he saw the pale&#xD;
cheek flush, and the delicate shoulder shrink&#xD;
as from a blow.&#xD;
"I know-" she said, with something&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
of a gasp. "But I think he will forgive&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"I do not doubt it," Darcy dryly an-&#xD;
swered. "I believe there is the carriage at&#xD;
last. Will you allow me?"&#xD;
He assisted her once more out of the&#xD;
sleigh, and put her into the carriage, which&#xD;
had drawn up beside theni. Then he closed&#xD;
the door, and raised his hat.&#xD;
"Are you not coming?" she asked in&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
He shook his head.&#xD;
"No. I shall drive these horses in.-&#xD;
Did you bring the reins I sent for, John?&#xD;
Yes-that is all right. Miss Aylmer I&#xD;
would recommend a glass of wine ni. s~~on&#xD;
you reach home.-Drive on, Green."&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THOSE WHO DANCE MUST PAY THE PIPER.&#xD;
WHEN Miss Aylmer reached home, her&#xD;
grandfather came hurrying down into the&#xD;
lower hall to meet her; and from him she&#xD;
learned that the surgeon was then setting&#xD;
Julian's arm.&#xD;
"Oh, g~randpapa, how can I ever forgive&#xD;
myself!" she cried, with all the terror, the&#xD;
anxiety, the vexation of the last hour cub&#xD;
minating at length in a burst of weeping,&#xD;
which quite startled M. Vacquant by its ~i-&#xD;
olence. "I have half-killed that poor boy,&#xD;
and I came very near quite killing your-&#xD;
your nephew, while I, the cause of it all,&#xD;
am not hurt in the least. Oh, I am a&#xD;
wretch !-I don't know what you must&#xD;
think of me!"&#xD;
"I think you will know better next&#xD;
time, and be guided by the advice of older&#xD;
people," answered her grandfather, sooth-&#xD;
ingly. Like all men, he had a nervous hor-&#xD;
ror of tears, and he would have said any&#xD;
thing to stop the lachrymal flow that was&#xD;
pouring over th~ shoulder of his coat as&#xD;
he held his granddaughter in his arms.&#xD;
"Don't be foolish, petite; and don't cry&#xD;
that way-it is dreadful! Julian is not&#xD;
much hurt, and you are safe-let us thank&#xD;
God for that."&#xD;
&#xD;
THOSE WHO DANCE MUST PAY THE PIPER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish I had been hurt!" cried Vale-&#xD;
rie. "I deserve any thing! I was the per-&#xD;
son in fault, and I-I am the only one all&#xD;
safe."&#xD;
"What! Is Maurice hurt also? ~' asked&#xD;
M. Vacquant, quickly. "Nobody told me&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"Hurt! He says he is not, but I know&#xD;
he must be. 0 grandpapa, it was awful!&#xD;
If you could have seen the fight he had, to&#xD;
stop those horses! I expected every mo-&#xD;
ment that they would dash him under their&#xD;
feet and trample him to death. They must&#xD;
have hurt him !-I know they must-and&#xD;
all for ~&#xD;
At which consideration, Miss Aylmer&#xD;
sat down on one of the library-chairs-her&#xD;
grandfather had drawn her into this room&#xD;
-and sobbed more like a child than like&#xD;
the bright, haughty La balls des belles.&#xD;
"He is a brave fellow-Maurice!" said&#xD;
M. Vacquant. "I knew he could be relied&#xD;
on-and, mom .Dieu! how glad I am that&#xD;
I sent him! I hope you won't forget, en-&#xD;
faint, that you owe your life to him."&#xD;
"Forget it?-no! And that is just the&#xD;
hardest part of it all!" cried enfant, with a&#xD;
burst of tears that were now solely born&#xD;
of vexation. "I could bear all the rest,&#xD;
but that is intolerable! To think how I&#xD;
have treated him, and how I despised him,&#xD;
and how I went against all his advice, and&#xD;
how I snubbed him, and-and that he&#xD;
should have been the one to stop the&#xD;
horses! If it had been anybody else in&#xD;
the wide world, I could have borne it bet-&#xD;
ter; but this is too bard!"&#xD;
"Valerie!" said MS Vacquant. He was&#xD;
quite aghast, and he could say nothing&#xD;
more.&#xD;
"0 grandpapa, you don't know how&#xD;
hard it is! ~tou never had to endure such&#xD;
a humiliation! I don't believe any body&#xD;
ever had to endure the like before! Under&#xD;
obligation for my very life to-to a person&#xD;
like that!"&#xD;
"Valerie, this is very improper-very&#xD;
ungrateful language," said her grandfather,&#xD;
severely. "You force me to remind you&#xD;
that you are speaking of my nephew as&#xD;
well as your cousin; and of a man who has&#xD;
just saved your life at the risk of his own."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't need to be reminded," cried&#xD;
Valerie, in a tone of exasperation. "That&#xD;
is exactly what is the matter! I wish he&#xD;
had let my neck be broken-I do! This is&#xD;
the second time he has laid me under obli-&#xD;
gation, and I-I hate him!"&#xD;
"That will do, I think," said M. Vac-&#xD;
quant, with quite an imposing wave of the&#xD;
hand. For once he was so thoroughly out&#xD;
of patience with his petted, spoiled grand-&#xD;
child, that he could not forbear expressing&#xD;
it. "That is quite sufficient, Valerie. When&#xD;
you are cooler, you will 'see the impropriety&#xD;
and ingratitude of this conduct. At present&#xD;
you had better go and change your dress."&#xD;
Valerie rose at once from her seat, but,&#xD;
instead of going to change her dress, she&#xD;
went and twined her arms round her grand-&#xD;
father's neck.&#xD;
"I am sorry," she said. "I know it&#xD;
sounded very badly. I won't talk so any&#xD;
more-I will indeed try not to feel so any&#xD;
more. But don't let him come between you&#xD;
and me, grandpapa-especially after I have&#xD;
been so nearly taken from you."&#xD;
"Yes," said M. Vacquant, in a hushed&#xD;
voice; and he kissed tenderly the beautiful&#xD;
face of which he was so proud. "Yes, you&#xD;
were nearly taken from me, and you are&#xD;
given back to me again-thanks to is bon&#xD;
.Dieu, and, after Him, thanks to Maurice."&#xD;
Valerie set her lips hard, but, true to&#xD;
her promise, she said nothing. She only&#xD;
thought that it was part-the hardest part&#xD;
-of her punishment, to hear this, and to&#xD;
know that it was true. After God, she cer-&#xD;
tainly owed her safety of life and limb to&#xD;
Maurice Darcy; and there is not a doubt&#xD;
but that, as she said, she would rather have&#xD;
owed it to anybody else in the wide world.&#xD;
It was not enough that she had resisted his&#xD;
entreaties, and set his advice at naught, in&#xD;
this particular matter; but she had so dis-&#xD;
liked him, from the first, so gloried in pro~&#xD;
yoking his tacit disapproval by h~er manifes-&#xD;
tations of caprice and coquetry, and now&#xD;
this very caprice and coquetry had called&#xD;
down upon her the weightiest obligation to&#xD;
him that one human being can incur ~om&#xD;
another. It Was a retribution-she felt&#xD;
that-but she also felt that it was almost&#xD;
more than she could bear.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Grandpapa, toll me about Julian," she'&#xD;
said, after a minute. "Is he much hurt?"&#xD;
"The doctors think not," answered her&#xD;
grandf4ther. "lie is still, I believe, lying&#xD;
in a half-stunned condition; but they say&#xD;
-at least Dr. Preston does-that he will get&#xD;
over that in a few hours without any ill&#xD;
effect, and that his arm is the only serious&#xD;
injury."&#xD;
"Serious! Do you mean dangerous?"&#xD;
"Oh, no. Who ever heard of danger&#xD;
from a broken bone~ The only injury that&#xD;
will trouble him after a day or two, they&#xD;
mean."&#xD;
"Thank God!" said Valerie, fervently.&#xD;
"Not but that a broken arm is bad enough,"&#xD;
she added, hastily; "but one feels as if it&#xD;
was little, because it is so much less than&#xD;
might have been. Poor Julian I poor boy!&#xD;
o grandpapa, I never expect to forgive my-&#xD;
self for, causing him all this!"&#xD;
* M, Vacquant smiled a little-Julian's in"&#xD;
juries did not seem to weigh much on his&#xD;
mind-and smoothed her hair indulgently..&#xD;
"Don't worry about Julian," he said. "He&#xD;
will, soon be well. Only take care," he&#xD;
added, gravely, "that you never inflict a&#xD;
deeper injury on him than~ auy you have&#xD;
caused to-day."&#xD;
Valerie's face flushed. Her conscience&#xD;
told her at once what he meant-and, for&#xD;
once, she did not reject or fence off the un-&#xD;
palatable advice. "Never, if I can help it,&#xD;
grandpapa," she said, earnestly. Then she&#xD;
kissed him again, and, gathering up her jiat&#xD;
and cloak, which she had cast aside on her,&#xD;
entrance, went up-stairs.&#xD;
Just as she reached the head of the&#xD;
staircase, she came upon Madame Vacquant&#xD;
and Dr. Preston, who were standing outside&#xD;
the door of Julian3s chamber, talking to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
"I think all will go right now~" the doe-&#xD;
tQr was saying, "if you, will keep things per-*&#xD;
feetly quiet, and don't allow- Ab, Miss&#xD;
Aylmer, how are you? I am glad to see&#xD;
that you at least were not hurt by your ac-&#xD;
cident."&#xD;
"I ean scarcely be glad myself; doctor,&#xD;
when I think that others suffered instead of&#xD;
me," answered Valerie, yielding her hand to&#xD;
the physician's cordial grasp, but looking&#xD;
&#xD;
past him to Madame Vacquant, whose face&#xD;
had hardened at her approach. "How is-&#xD;
Julian?"&#xD;
She hesitated a moment before uttering&#xD;
the name, and then gave it with a softness&#xD;
which, if Julian could have heard~ he would&#xD;
certainly have thought quite irresistible.&#xD;
But his mother's face did not relax. in the&#xD;
least; and it was the doctor who answered.&#xD;
"Oh, Julian is doing as well as we could&#xD;
hope or desire; and, like a gallant knight,&#xD;
I am surd he does not regret the wound he&#xD;
incurred in so fair a service "-he thought&#xD;
it necessary to point this compliment by ~&#xD;
little bow, "The fracture was a simple one,&#xD;
and has been well set. As for the insensi-&#xD;
bility caused by concussion of the brain, that&#xD;
wrn soon pass off-has, in fact, almost en-&#xD;
tirely passed off now."&#xD;
"May-inay I see him now, then I"&#xD;
"I am sure he will be very much de-&#xD;
lighted-and I really think he deserves&#xD;
such a reward," answered the doctor, mov-&#xD;
ing aside, and laying his hand on the handle&#xD;
of the door t9 open it for her. But as he&#xD;
did so, Madai~ue Vacquant interposed.&#xD;
"Stop," she said. "There must be no&#xD;
further risks run. Are you sure it is quite&#xD;
safe for him to be excited by seeing her?"&#xD;
"Safe! Oh certaluly, certainly," an-&#xD;
swered the doctor, who had a ~iot uncom-&#xD;
mon ~enc7uznt for pretty faces in general,&#xD;
and Miss Aylmer's in particular. Indeed, it&#xD;
will be the best thing possible to let him&#xD;
see with~ his own eyes that Miss Aylmer is&#xD;
all right. "His first question was whether&#xD;
you were safe," he added, looking at the&#xD;
young lady; "and I think he was decidedly&#xD;
incredulous of our replies. Show yourself&#xD;
to him at least, and his mind will be set at&#xD;
rest."&#xD;
Madame Vacquant made no further de-&#xD;
mur, but when he opened the door, and&#xD;
Valerie entered the chamber, she only&#xD;
waited to say a few words and then hastily&#xD;
followed.&#xD;
The surgeon who had set the fractured&#xD;
limb, and one or two servants, were in the&#xD;
room, but Valerie paid no attention to them.&#xD;
She walked straight across the floor, and did&#xD;
not pause until she stood by the richly-&#xD;
carved and luxurious bed, gazing down on&#xD;
&#xD;
Bomney's white face-the face whiter by far&#xD;
than the snowy pillows on which It rested.&#xD;
He looked almost as if he wera dead, so&#xD;
rigid and colorless were his features; but&#xD;
the breath came perceptibly, almost audibly&#xD;
through the parted lips, and more than once,&#xD;
while she stood there, a slight convulsion as&#xD;
of pain passed over the face. The eyelids did&#xD;
not lift, however; and when at last Valerie&#xD;
heard the rustle of a woman's dress, and&#xD;
knew that his mother stood beside her, she&#xD;
whispered, without turning her head-&#xD;
"Is he insensible?"&#xD;
Before Madame Vacquant could answer,&#xD;
the darkly-fringed lids flew up, and the vio-&#xD;
let eyes opened full and wide on her face.&#xD;
For a moment there was almost incredulous&#xD;
surprise in their gaze-then a smile came&#xD;
over the pale lips.&#xD;
"So they told me the truth. You are&#xD;
quite safe!" he said, faintly.&#xD;
She knelt down by the bedside and cov-&#xD;
ered his uninjured hand with both her own.&#xD;
~kyes, Tam quite safe," she said. "But it&#xD;
breaks my heart to look at you and think-&#xD;
it is all my fault."&#xD;
"No, no," he said, eagerly; "you must&#xD;
not think that, even for a moment. It is&#xD;
not your fault, or-or if it was~ it does not&#xD;
matter. I am not much hurt, and I shall&#xD;
soon be well again."&#xD;
"You are suffering now - that is&#xD;
enough."&#xD;
"I am not suffering now. I would not&#xD;
change places at this moment-" he grasped&#xD;
firmly the hands that were holding his-&#xD;
"with any one in the world."&#xD;
He did not try to restrain the passion in&#xD;
his voice; and, as he spoke, there rushed&#xD;
over Valerie the recollection of her grand-&#xD;
father's words a few minutes before: "Take&#xD;
care that you never inflict a deeper injury&#xD;
than any you have caused to-day!" At an-&#xD;
other time she would have known exactly&#xD;
how to repress any undue exhibition of feel-&#xD;
ing like this; but now-how could she do&#xD;
it now? Let him disclaim as he might, she&#xD;
knew that it was her fault alone that he lay&#xD;
stricken and injured before her; and to be&#xD;
cold to one who had suffered and would yet&#xD;
suffer so much for her wilfulness and ca-&#xD;
price, was more than she could do. Let us&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
hope that it was more than any woman&#xD;
could have done.&#xD;
"I think I shall never forgive myself;"&#xD;
~he said, aftir a moment's pause. "It is a&#xD;
mercy that you are alive-a mercy for which&#xD;
I can never be sufficiently thankful !-and&#xD;
the horses nearly killed Captain Darcy,&#xD;
"Darcy! What did he have to do with&#xD;
them?"&#xD;
She saw that he knew nothing about her&#xD;
rescue; and, remembering his jealous dis-&#xD;
like of Darcy, she felt sorry for having spok-&#xD;
en of the matter-but it was too late now.&#xD;
She must go on. He would have to hear&#xD;
the particulars sooner or later, and he had&#xD;
better hear them now while she could soft-&#xD;
en the blow to him.&#xD;
"Did you not know that he stopped&#xD;
them?" she asked. "I don't know where&#xD;
he came from, but he was at the gates, and&#xD;
-and he stopped them."&#xD;
"Darcy!"&#xD;
It was all he said; but a deep flush of&#xD;
mortified feeling came over his face, and his&#xD;
eyes closed again. This was the end of it,&#xD;
then! He had been thrown aside and left&#xD;
behind, helpless and useless, while Darcy&#xD;
was the hero of the adventure! On Darcy&#xD;
fell all the honor and glory of the occasion!&#xD;
It was hard-it was bitterly hard-and it&#xD;
seemed all at once to take away even the&#xD;
consolation of Valerie's presence, and to&#xD;
give a sharper edge to every throb of pain&#xD;
in the fractured limb,&#xD;
With the quickness of her sex, Valerie&#xD;
read these thoughts, and her own rebellious&#xD;
chafing against the fate that had made Dar-&#xD;
cy her rescuer caused her to do more than&#xD;
comprehend-to sympathize with them. If&#xD;
all had been equal between the two, in the&#xD;
way of her personal liking~ she would have&#xD;
felt most warmly toward the one who had&#xD;
all the suffering and none of the~glory; but&#xD;
as it was, her whole heart went out with a&#xD;
rush in the endeavor to comfort him.&#xD;
"Captain Darcy was very hard on me,"&#xD;
she said, softly. "I don't think he will soon,&#xD;
if ever, forgive me the trouble I cost him.&#xD;
I-I cannot help wishing that it had been&#xD;
any one else who chanced to stop the&#xD;
horses."&#xD;

&#xD;
The violet eyes opened again on her face&#xD;
-this time full of sadness and pain.&#xD;
"But he saved your life! And I was&#xD;
lying, like a helpless log, far away."&#xD;
"Julian! "&#xD;
She uttered the name almost involun-&#xD;
tarily-then smiled at his start, and went&#xD;
on:&#xD;
"May I call you that? I almost feel as&#xD;
if we were blood lFindred, and quite near&#xD;
enough for it. We~~ulian, I wonder you&#xD;
can be so foolish. I wonder you can pain&#xD;
me by mentioning my debt to you, and my&#xD;
debt to Captain Darcy, in the same breath.&#xD;
He saved my life, it is true, but he saved it&#xD;
as he might have saved the life of any stran-&#xD;

half so graciously as he would probably have&#xD;

can I tell you what that is?"&#xD;
He smiled a little.&#xD;
"I am afraid I will never win the favor,&#xD;
though. This-" he glanced toward his in-&#xD;
jured arm-" does not look much like der-&#xD;
ring-do."&#xD;
For an instant, she did not comprehend&#xD;
him. Then a recnllection of the gay non-&#xD;
sense they had been talking, just before the&#xD;
horses put a summary end to their conver-&#xD;
sation, flashed across her. In a moment her&#xD;
fingers went up to her throat-the next, a&#xD;
knot of bright ribbon was lying in his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
It was just at this juncture that the sur-&#xD;
geon touched the arm of Madame Vacquant,&#xD;
who~ had walked away from jhe bed and&#xD;
stood by a window not far off, looking ofit&#xD;
at the falling snow, with a strange, absent&#xD;
kind of gaze.&#xD;
"I am sorry to disturb such an interest-&#xD;
ing conversation as the one yonder~ seems&#xD;
to be," he said, with a dry smile; "but I&#xD;
must really beg you to take the young lady&#xD;
away. She is exciting our patient too much,&#xD;
I fear."&#xD;
Madame Vacquant turned hurriedly.&#xD;
"I was afraid of that," she said. "It was&#xD;
Dr. Preston, not I, who let her come in.'&#xD;
&#xD;
He thought it would set Julian's mind at&#xD;
rest to see that she was safe."&#xD;
"S-c'! She was the lady he was driv-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"Humph!" said the surgeon; and he&#xD;
looked round at Valerie, with his quick,.&#xD;
keen glance. "I could warrant her for&#xD;
being at the bottom of any harm or mischief&#xD;
whatever," he thought. Then he said&#xD;
aloud: "I must beg you to send her away,&#xD;
at all events. His mind has been set at rest&#xD;
now, and that is sufficient."&#xD;
Madame Vacquant needed no further&#xD;
bidding. She walked forward at once, and&#xD;
laid her hand on Valerie's shoulder.&#xD;
"You must go," she said, Without taking&#xD;
the trouble to soften the command at all.&#xD;
"Dr. Warner says you are exciting Julian&#xD;
too much. You must go!"&#xD;
Julian uttered an exclamation of impa-&#xD;
tience; but Valerie rose to her feet without&#xD;
an instant's loss of time.&#xD;
"I am sorry," she said. "I did not&#xD;
mean to excite him. Yes, I know I must&#xD;
go. I only meant to stay a minute," she&#xD;
added., looking at Romney. "Of course, I&#xD;
knew it would not do.-You must be quiet,&#xD;
and oh, do try to 8et better soon: I shall&#xD;
be so miserable-thinking of your suffer-&#xD;
ing!"&#xD;
"I must certainly try to get better soon,&#xD;
then," he said. "That you should be mis-&#xD;
erable on account of my sufferings would&#xD;
double them at least. But you will come&#xD;
back again-will you not?"&#xD;
Fortunately, Madame Vacquant gave no&#xD;
lime for reply to this. She had already&#xD;
drawn Valerie away, and the young lady-&#xD;
who even in that moment of excitement had&#xD;
no idea of forgetting 1e8 eonvenancea far&#xD;
enough to promise to play romantic nurse&#xD;
to her wounded knight.-was spared.the dif-&#xD;
ficulty of expressing a refusal. Before she&#xD;
knew what she was about, she had left the&#xD;
room, and was standing in the corridor with&#xD;
Madame Vacquant. The latter spoke first.&#xD;
"Excuse me if I was abrupt-but I can-&#xD;
not run any risk, you know. The doctor&#xD;
told me to take you away."&#xD;
"Run any risk! I should think not,&#xD;
indeed!" said Valerie. And than, for the&#xD;
&#xD;
first time in her life, she put her arms round&#xD;
her grandfather's wife and kissed her. "Try&#xD;
to forgive me," she whispered. "I am so&#xD;
very sorry."&#xD;
The tone was full of the most sincere&#xD;
contrition-all the more sincere, because the&#xD;
words were so simple-and might have&#xD;
touched the elder woman, if any thing pos-&#xD;
sibly could have done so. But her face&#xD;
scarcely changed by a shade, and, when she&#xD;
turned and laid her lips on the girl's cheek,&#xD;
with a light, cold caress, Valerie felt instinc-&#xD;
tively that the mother's heart was mailed in&#xD;
steel against her.&#xD;
"I have nothing to forgive," she said;&#xD;
"hardly even a right to blame. It was my&#xD;
fault as much as yours. I should have lis-&#xD;
tened to Maurice Darcy."&#xD;
Maurice Darcy! That name seemed des-&#xD;
tined to meet Valerie at every turn-stab-&#xD;
bing her with a sharp remembrance of the&#xD;
discomfiture which she could not help feel-&#xD;
ing as if she owed to him. In a moment, at&#xD;
sound of it, all, her softer feelings vanished;&#xD;
and she drew back, biting her lip.&#xD;
"Captain Darcy ought to be gratified,"&#xD;
she said. "Accident chanced to justify his&#xD;
opinion of the horses, and immediately ev-&#xD;
erybody exalts him to the highest pedestal&#xD;
of wisdom and heroism. For my part-"&#xD;
She stopped short-blushing violently,&#xD;
despite herself-for Darcy, who had come&#xD;
down the thickly-carpeted corridor quite&#xD;
unheard, paused at this moment beside Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant.&#xD;
At first, Valerie hoped that he had not&#xD;
caught the tenor of her interrupted speech,&#xD;
he looked so entirely as usual, so little as he&#xD;
might have been expected to look, under&#xD;
the circumstances; but, the next moment,&#xD;
she saw a 'gleam in his eye that she knew&#xD;
very well-a gleam, half-amused, half-sa-&#xD;
tiric-which made her heart sink for very&#xD;
shame until it could sink no lower. She&#xD;
knew then that her hope was vain, and&#xD;
that, although he had presence of mind&#xD;
enough to suppress any outward tokens of&#xD;
the fact, he had certainly overheard her.&#xD;
With this dismaying consciousness pressing&#xD;
on her-dismaying necessarily, since she&#xD;
was, at least, thoroughly aware of the ex-&#xD;
tent of her obligations to the man who had&#xD;
&#xD;
stood between herself and a horrible death&#xD;
-it was not wonderful that she was hardly&#xD;
able to pay any attention to what he said,&#xD;
that she had only a vague idea of his inqui-&#xD;
ries about Julian, and his explanation that&#xD;
he had only just arrived with the thorough-&#xD;
breds, or that she gave a quick start, when&#xD;
at last he turned to herself.&#xD;
"I hope you followed my advice about&#xD;
the wine, Miss Aylmer? You look very&#xD;
pale, and this afternoon's work will, I fear&#xD;
prove to have beentoo much for you."&#xD;
"I have not taken it yet, but I will go&#xD;
now and send for it," said Valerie, with&#xD;
most unusual meekness. Then she bent her&#xD;
head and hurried away-never once paus-&#xD;
ing or looking back, until she found herself&#xD;
safely locked in her own chamber, where,&#xD;
sitting down in t~he first convenient chair,&#xD;
she finished at her leisure that salutary fit.&#xD;
of weeping which M. Vacquanthad tempo-&#xD;
rarily stopped., When she was aroused..at&#xD;
last by the first dinner-bell, and, ringing for&#xD;
Fanchette, sent her down with an excuse&#xD;
for her own no~i-appearance, even Darcy&#xD;
might have thought that her pale, tear-&#xD;
stained countenance looked as if she had&#xD;
been punished enough.&#xD;
It is scarcely necessary to dwell on the&#xD;
convalescence which followed this accident.&#xD;
After having nearly broken his neck, and&#xD;
quite broken his arm, Miss Aylmer felt&#xD;
very truly that she would have been the&#xD;
most ungracious and ungrateful of human&#xD;
beings, if she had kept up her intended re-&#xD;
serve with Romney, or had not endeavored,&#xD;
by every means in her power, to lighteu the&#xD;
hours of his captivity. So, when he recov~&#xD;
ered sufficiently to leave his own oham~&#xD;
ber, and lie day after day on a broad,&#xD;
low couch in his mother's private sitting-&#xD;
room, she set herself studiously to the task&#xD;
of entertaining him. She read to. him, sang&#xD;
te him, talked to him, with an aZ.encZez&amp;amp;&#xD;
which came of her self-reproach and desire&#xD;
to make atonement, but which was so&#xD;
charming in itself that it might well have&#xD;
turned an older and a wiser head. Natu-&#xD;
rally, therefore, it turned Romney's. l~Tat-&#xD;
urally, also, they grew to be very intimate&#xD;
with one another, to exercise the right of&#xD;

THOSE WHO DANCE MUST FAY THE FIPER.              69&#xD;
&#xD;
68                       VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
tutolA'nent which their near connection&#xD;
gave, to glide from amusement into senti-&#xD;
ment, and from sentiment into-neither of&#xD;
them very well knew what, without anybody&#xD;
taking the trouble to interfere or reprove.&#xD;
Madame Vacquant of course saw what&#xD;
was going on, but it is not uncharitable to&#xD;
suppose that it tallied too exactly with her&#xD;
own wishes for her to desire, far less to at-&#xD;
tempt, any disturbance of the work of fate&#xD;
-while, as for M. Vacquant, he had deliv-&#xD;
ered himself of one warning, and, man-like,&#xD;
he thought that would prove sufficient. In-&#xD;
deed, as far as regarded any serious dan-&#xD;
ger, he was wholly blind. In his eyes, his&#xD;
granddaughter was peerless, and his step-&#xD;
son a pretty, spoiled boy. That the latter&#xD;
should like the former was, of course, to be&#xD;
expected, and that the former should en-&#xD;
courage the liking was, perhaps, excusable,&#xD;
considering that it is the nature of women&#xD;
to be foolish; but of any serious conse-&#xD;
quences to their manifest flirtation, he nev-&#xD;
er once dreamed. If anybody had hinted&#xD;
such a thing, he would indeed have been&#xD;
simply incredulous. There was a great&#xD;
deal of the gs'and .seigneus' about him, and&#xD;
he could not, or did not, realize that mat-&#xD;
ters had changed ~in These latter days, and,&#xD;
with manners, many other things that he&#xD;
had been trained to reverence. He had&#xD;
received one sharp lesson in his life about&#xD;
attempting to carry out his noldeaee-oilige&#xD;
theory in all its bearings, and to force a&#xD;
woman's inclination where it had no mind&#xD;
to go; but, as is too often the case, this les-&#xD;
son had not made him wiser. He was&#xD;
ready and anxious to play the same part&#xD;
over again with his granddaughter, that he&#xD;
had already played without success, in the&#xD;
case of his sister. He remembered how&#xD;
women were trained in France to take the&#xD;
husband which competent authority pro-&#xD;
vided for them, and to love, honor, and&#xD;
obey, exactly that person who seemed most&#xD;
desirable to the head of the house; and he&#xD;
was still unable to realize the different&#xD;
canon that regulated another country. It&#xD;
seemed good to him that Valerie should&#xD;
marry Maurice Darcy, and he could not&#xD;
credit any possible objection on her part.&#xD;
It was true that they were within the for-&#xD;
&#xD;
bidden degrees of kindred, but, with all the&#xD;
weighty reasons for an alliance taken into&#xD;
consideration, he was sure that they could&#xD;
easily obtain a dispensation; and, in every&#xD;
other respect, the plan was unimpeachable.&#xD;
It was also true that be had been a good&#xD;
deal surprised and somewhat shocked to&#xD;
hear Valerie declare that she "despised"&#xD;
and "hated" this desirable parti; but then,&#xD;
she had spoken in a moment of excitement,&#xD;
and .some faint remembrance of the manner&#xD;
in which the wise old Vicar of Wakefield&#xD;
read backward his daughter's expressed&#xD;
opinions, floating through M. Vacquant's&#xD;
remembrance, he had hoped that even these&#xD;
unpromising expressions might be favor-&#xD;
ably construed. A woman's dislike, any-&#xD;
how, he felt inclined to shrug his shoulders&#xD;
over as a mere liagatelle. Valerie was&#xD;
spoiled, and Maurice was rather uncom-&#xD;
promising-that was all I They would get&#xD;
on all the better for the difference; indeed,&#xD;
La petite sadly needed a little control, a lit-&#xD;
tle wholesome awe of somebody to keep&#xD;
her caprice and coquetry in check.&#xD;
This was the manner in which M.&#xD;
Vacquant reasoned, and the manner in&#xD;
which, almost unconsciously, he consoled&#xD;
himself for his granddaughter's perverse&#xD;
mode of co~iduct. It was true that she and&#xD;
Darcy rarely noticed each other at all, and&#xD;
never without eliciting some clang or jar of&#xD;
feeling; and it was also true that, day by&#xD;
day, Romney advanced to a closer degree&#xD;
of privileged intimacy with her-but still&#xD;
M. Vacquant was aware that he had an-&#xD;
nounced his sovereign will and pleasure;&#xD;
and, therefore, although this nonsense&#xD;
might be a rather dangerous amusement,&#xD;
he could not bring himself to the serious&#xD;
contemplation of any serious harm oc-&#xD;
curring from it. Nevertheless, it sudden-&#xD;
ly one 'lay occurred to hin i that he might&#xD;
as well enlighten Darcy concerning the&#xD;
matrimonial project of which as yet the&#xD;
latter was profoundly ignorant, and, with&#xD;
him, action was not slow upon resolve. In&#xD;
the course of an hour he had called lfau-&#xD;
rice into the library and made his an~&#xD;
announcement rather grandiosely than other-&#xD;
wise. To his utter amazement, it was met&#xD;
by a short and decisive refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose you mean kindly, sir," the&#xD;
latter said, "but, once for all, the thing is&#xD;
impossible. Once for all, I must earnestly&#xD;
request that my name may not be considered&#xD;
in connection with your future testamentary&#xD;
arrangements-much less, considered with&#xD;
reference to any such plan as this. Were I&#xD;
ten times as poor a man as I am, I should not&#xD;
desire a woman who accepted me, or whom&#xD;
I accepted, as a mercenary compromise I&#xD;
You need not start, sir; I do Miss Aylmer&#xD;
the justice to believe that she would repudi-&#xD;
ate the idea as quickly as I, and I would&#xD;
quite as soon put my hand in the fire as to&#xD;
insult her by such a proposition."&#xD;
M. Vacquant bit his lip angrily, and per-&#xD;
haps at that moment felt little inclination to&#xD;
say that General Aylmer had not spoken as&#xD;
if his granddaughter would be insulted by&#xD;
such a proposition.&#xD;
"You are exciting yourself unnecessa-&#xD;
rily," he said, coldly. "I have little inten-&#xD;
tion of forcing either my fortune or my&#xD;
granddaughter on an unwilling recipient of&#xD;
either, As for mercenary compromise-&#xD;
that is quite a novelesque phrase; but I con-&#xD;
fess I don't understand it in its present ap-&#xD;
plication. Nothing was further from my in-&#xD;
tention than forcing anybody's inclination.&#xD;
I paid you the compliment of thinking yon&#xD;
might please Valerie if you chose to try, and&#xD;
s/ia has certainly proved fascinating to men&#xD;
as wise as yourself."&#xD;
"Pardon me," Darcy said, a little con-&#xD;
tritely. "I suppose I did speak more warm-&#xD;
ly than occasion demanded-it is a bad fault&#xD;
of mine-but I have neither taken, nor&#xD;
meant to gh~e, offence. Indeed, how could&#xD;
I be otherwise than grateful for your con-&#xD;
sideration of me? I only meant what I&#xD;
now repeat with more humility than pride&#xD;
-it is impossible. Your kindness blinds you&#xD;
to the insurmountable obstacles opposing&#xD;
~uch a plan."&#xD;
"What obstacles? ~7 his uncle asked,&#xD;
sharply. This plan had lain so long near&#xD;
to his heart, that the disappointment was&#xD;
keen to him.&#xD;
"There are many; but two will suffice,"&#xD;
Darcy answered, quietly. "In the first&#xD;
place, you are mistaken in thinking that I&#xD;
could ever please Miss Aylmer. Were I&#xD;
&#xD;
ready to-day for the r6le of Suitor, I would&#xD;
play to no purpose, as far as she is concerned.&#xD;
I do her only justice when I say that not&#xD;
even the glamour of an inheritance could&#xD;
make her look favorably upon me. In&#xD;
the second place, yon must pardon me if&#xD;
this sounds ungracious - I should never&#xD;
choose Miss Aylmer out of the world of&#xD;
women as my wife. Perhaps, the fault lies&#xD;
in my own insensibility-since, as you say,&#xD;
wiser and better *men than I have found&#xD;
her fascinating; but I scarcely think I shall&#xD;
ever choose. any woman half so fatally&#xD;
tempted by the dower of beauty."&#xD;
"This is the first time that I ever heard&#xD;
a man-and a painter to boot-quarrel with&#xD;
a woman's good looks."&#xD;
"It is not the looks I quarrel with, sir~&#xD;
but the use made of them."&#xD;
"Ab, she is something of a coquette; but&#xD;
what pretty woman is not? And matrimo-&#xD;
ny is a sure cure for the worst cases of&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"Do you think so? My experience goes&#xD;
rather the other way. At least~ I should&#xD;
have neither patience nor inclination to play&#xD;
Petruchio to a Kate who flirted instead of&#xD;
scolded. I think~ indeed, that of the two&#xD;
I would prefer the shrew, since she, at least,&#xD;
would not play fast and loose with-but,&#xD;
once more, it is doing Miss Aylmer a great&#xD;
wrong to bring her name, even indirectly,&#xD;
into such a discussion. Don't think me&#xD;
churlish, sir, when I beg you to draw up&#xD;
your will without any reference to me; and&#xD;
assure you, indeed, that the only favor you&#xD;
can do me, is to leave my name out of it.&#xD;
Now let us consider the matter finally ~t an&#xD;
end."&#xD;
"If it must be "-began M. Vacquant,&#xD;
with a sigh.&#xD;
"It must, indeed," said the other, firmly.&#xD;
"And now, if you will allow me to ask one&#xD;
question: has Miss Aylmer heard of this&#xD;
plan?"&#xD;
The old Frenchman hesitated; but in all&#xD;
his threescore years he had never know-&#xD;
ingly spoken a falsehood, so, after a pause, he&#xD;
answered in the affirmative, adding, "Why&#xD;
do you ask?~~&#xD;
"Only because I would like to disabuse&#xD;
her of a false impression as far as I am con-&#xD;

have set her mind at ease some time since&#xD;
by assuring her that' she had nothing to&#xD;
fear from my rivalry in your good graces,&#xD;
but that it seemed scarcely worth while to&#xD;
take the trouble, as I am leaving so soon."&#xD;
At 'these words, M. Vacquant's face fell&#xD;
suddenly and strangely. "Leaving!" he&#xD;
repeated. "So you are going to torment&#xD;
me with that cry again. I think it very&#xD;
hard that you should treat me soMaurice!&#xD;
-very hard indeed, that you cannot spare&#xD;
me a few xiionths without continually agi-&#xD;
tating this subject. What is the matter that&#xD;
you cannot stay here, at least until spring?"&#xD;
"You forget, sir, that this is an idle life,&#xD;
and that I am far from being an idle man;&#xD;
that I have, indeed, to make my bread by the&#xD;
labor of my hand."&#xD;
'"I have offered, again and again, to re-&#xD;
move that necessity from you."&#xD;
"I remember that gratefully, but y6u&#xD;
must indulge me in the obstinacy which pre-&#xD;
fers to retain it."&#xD;
"Paint here, then !-what is 'to prevent&#xD;
your painting here?"&#xD;
"Nothing to prevent my painting; but~&#xD;
a great deal to prevent my remaining here.&#xD;
You surely forget that your own claim is a&#xD;
new one, and a slight one, compared to the&#xD;
other which is calling me away."&#xD;
"No, I don't forget it," said M. Yac-&#xD;
quant, in a voice which subdued itself at&#xD;
once; "' but then, Maurice-you cannot say&#xD;
he needs you."&#xD;
A sort of wistful look swept over the&#xD;
face at which he gazed, and sudden tender-&#xD;
ness softened the gray eyes, making them&#xD;
almost beautiful.&#xD;
"I need him," he said, softly, as if to&#xD;
himself. Then he turned to leave the room,&#xD;
but paused againin the door. "I fear I have&#xD;
notthanked you for yonrkin~Iness as I should&#xD;
have done," he said. "But pray. don't let&#xD;
my bruaques'ie make you forget that I do&#xD;
thank you,' that I am very grateful for the&#xD;
affection you are kind enough to express&#xD;
for me, and that I hope to see you choose a&#xD;
better heir t~ian I should be. I was never&#xD;
made for a rich man, and the burden of&#xD;
wealth would ill become me. Now I am&#xD;
going down to my studio; if you say so, I&#xD;
&#xD;
can call and see Payne about those stocks&#xD;
he wants you to invest in. Shall I tell him&#xD;
no, as decidedly as he deserves?"&#xD;
"As decidedly as you please."&#xD;
The next moment, the firm, steady foot-&#xD;
step died away along the hall, and M. Yac-&#xD;
cjuant leaned back in his chair, a very with-&#xD;
ered and old-looking man, sighing bitterly.&#xD;
"So he puts tkat atonement out of, my&#xD;
power," be said, half aloud. "Well, then,&#xD;
there is only the other. It is very bitter-&#xD;
very bitter-but I suppose that is part of&#xD;
my burden. Atonement! -restitution! -&#xD;
easy words for priests to say; but whe&#xD;
among them all can mark the way to fulfil-&#xD;
ment?"&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
A DEOLAHATION-NOT or ~ovz.&#xD;
WHILE this discussion had been progress-&#xD;
ing in the library below, another of quite&#xD;
a different order was going on in Madame&#xD;
Vacquant's sitting-room above; was indeed&#xD;
still at its height when, hearing Darcy's step&#xD;
on the corridor outside, the lady opened the&#xD;
~door and invited him to enter.&#xD;
He complied, more for lack of a ready&#xD;
excuse to decline than for any other reason;&#xD;
yet the picture presented to his gaze was&#xD;
pretty enough to have tempted almost any&#xD;
~one to enter for the mere sake of admiring&#xD;
it at a closer point of view. Through the&#xD;
half-open door he had something more than&#xD;
a glimpse of the room within-the room&#xD;
~over whose luxurious and elegant appoint-&#xD;
ments Madame Vacquant's taste reigned&#xD;
supreme-and he saw, with something of&#xD;
the effect of a stereoscopic picture, the&#xD;
graceful furniture, the white statues, and&#xD;
the gleaming picture-frames, as they were&#xD;
relieved by the rich toning of the carpet&#xD;
and walls. There was nothing heavy, noth-&#xD;
ing out of keeping or out of taste, in the&#xD;
apartment, but an indescribable harmony&#xD;
and cheerfulness pervaded all its ai'range-&#xD;
ments; the latter, in part at least, owing to&#xD;
the bright flood of golden sunshine which&#xD;
was pouring through a large bay-window&#xD;
filled with plants, until it resembled a small&#xD;
&#xD;
conservatOry, in the midst of which a canary&#xD;
was trilling loudly from its gilded cage.&#xD;
Near the window the piano stood, and at&#xD;
the piano Miss Aylmer sat, half-turned aside&#xD;
from the key-board, but with the sheets of&#xD;
music plentifully scattered about, proving&#xD;
what her occupation had been, while, in a&#xD;
deep chair by the side, of the instrument,&#xD;
Romney reclined, his arm still hanging use-&#xD;
less in a sling of crimson silk, which became&#xD;
him wonderfully, and his whole air one ofauch&#xD;
intense listlessness that IDarcy set it down&#xD;
unhesitatingly to the score of affectation.&#xD;
He modified this judgment a little, however,&#xD;
when his first step in the room brought its&#xD;
warm air heavy-laden with fragrance rush-&#xD;
ing over him; and he was on the point of&#xD;
entering a protest against the injurious&#xD;
effects of over-heated apartments, when&#xD;
Madame Vacquant anticipated him by&#xD;
speaking.&#xD;
"Do, Maurice, see if ~on can bring this&#xD;
perverse boy to hear reason. Valerie and I&#xD;
are 'going down-street, and he insists on ac-&#xD;
companying us. Now, you know that will&#xD;
never do! The doctor-"&#xD;
"Au dialile with the doctor!" inter-&#xD;
rupted Julian, impatiently. "Really, I am&#xD;
tired of his very name, though of course he&#xD;
would have nothing to say in a matter of&#xD;
this kind. Indeed, why should he? He je&#xD;
a sensible man, though nobody would think&#xD;
so who listened to you, mamma. It has&#xD;
been three weeks since this con-trouble-&#xD;
some arm was l~roken; and I should have&#xD;
been out a week ago, but that I was too&#xD;
lazy, and home was too pleasant."&#xD;
"You did well to stay," said Valerie.&#xD;
"I give you fair warning you lose all your&#xD;
invalid privileges as soon as you cease to be&#xD;
an invalid."&#xD;
"Now, you are trying to frighten me&#xD;
into good\ behavior," answered he, languid-&#xD;
ly. "Bul I flatter myself that your words&#xD;
are harder than your resolution. At all&#xD;
events, I mean to go down-street with you&#xD;
to-day."&#xD;
"When I tell you that I don't want you?"&#xD;
C~ Yes-for once-even when you tell me&#xD;
that you do not want me."&#xD;
"I have a mind to stay at home myself,&#xD;
then."&#xD;
&#xD;
"IDol We shall practise that duct from&#xD;
Romeo ~ Giulietta so charmingly!"&#xD;
"Indeed, you need not fancy any thing&#xD;
of the kind. If I remains it wrn only be to&#xD;
shut myself up by myself, until Madame&#xD;
Yacquant returns."&#xD;
"You see how she rules me," said Juli-&#xD;
an, throwing himself back in his chair, with&#xD;
an. air of mock resignation. "I am a lion&#xD;
led by a thread; I shall soon have no more&#xD;
volition left than-.--than a puppet 1-Darcy,&#xD;
can't you say a word for me?"&#xD;
"There is really not the least reason&#xD;
why he should not go," said Darcy, turning&#xD;
to Madame Vacquant. "He speaks very&#xD;
truly when he says that he might have gone&#xD;
a week ago."&#xD;
"But the day," she said, hesitatingly.&#xD;
"It is so cold!"&#xD;
Maurice shrugged his shoulders, with a&#xD;
laugh.&#xD;
"I never heard of a fractured limb suf-&#xD;
fering on account of the depression of the&#xD;
thermometer," he said, good-humoredly.&#xD;
"Besides, it is not in any unpleasant degree."&#xD;
"And you think there is positively no&#xD;
danger?"&#xD;
"Positively, not the least."&#xD;
"Then, Valerie, we had better get&#xD;
ready," she said, turning to that young&#xD;
lady.-" Maurice, if you are going down-&#xD;
street, you may as well wait for us. You&#xD;
can afford to do so, since we are going to&#xD;
walk; and-we are going to see your pic-&#xD;
ture."&#xD;
Darcy could not repress~ a slight start.&#xD;
"My picture!" he repeated.&#xD;
"Yes, your picture. Ah, you may well&#xD;
look detected and'ashamed to think that all&#xD;
the city should be talking of it' before we-&#xD;
your own friends and relations-ever even&#xD;
heard of its existence."&#xD;
"It was only placed on exhibition yes-&#xD;
tei~day," he said, apologetically. "Of&#xD;
course, I meant toask you to si~e it-if you&#xD;
cared to do so. But I don't understand-&#xD;
how did you hear of it?"&#xD;
"flow did we hear of it! Have you not&#xD;
seen the Gazette this morning?"&#xD;

72                       VALERIE AYLMER.                                                  A DECLARATION-NOT OF LOVE.                 73&#xD;
&#xD;
ed down the sheet at a particular place, and,&#xD;
pointing to the head of the paragraph, hand-&#xD;
ed it to him. He took it in some surprise-&#xD;
surprise which perceptibly increased when&#xD;
he saw not less than a column of printed&#xD;
matter devoted to a critical and judicious&#xD;
notice of the picture concerning which Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant had just spoken. He flushed&#xD;
slightly, as one whom praise has taken una-&#xD;
wares, glanced his eye down over the terse,&#xD;
well-written sentences, and then looked up&#xD;
half-laughingly.&#xD;
"This is some of Thornton's work," he&#xD;
said; "I recognize his tricks of the pen,&#xD;
and-there is no one else who would be half&#xD;
so flattering."&#xD;
"Mr. Thornton is the best art-critic in&#xD;
the city," said Madame Vacquant, who was,&#xD;
when she chose, the best flatterer in the city.&#xD;
"If he is the writer of that article, of course&#xD;
there is no question of its correctness."&#xD;
"That does not exactly follow," said&#xD;
Darcy, smiling; "for he took a fancy to this&#xD;
picture before it was finished; and so is fair-&#xD;
ly ~hargeable with partiality toward it. He&#xD;
is a good art-critic, though," he went on;&#xD;
"for besides being a brilliant writer, he. is&#xD;
as thoroughly trained and cultivated, in an&#xD;
artistic sense, as a man can be with regard&#xD;
to a thing which is not the pursuit of his&#xD;
life. His criticism is always judicious, and&#xD;
his praise is worth having, because he knows&#xD;
what to praise, and how to praise it-which&#xD;
is ~nore than can be said for nine-tenths of&#xD;
the scribblers who display their ignorance&#xD;
even more conspicuously than they display&#xD;
their ill-nature in every thing relating to art&#xD;
or artists."&#xD;
"It is evident that Achilles has been&#xD;
touched on the heel in the past, if not in the&#xD;
present," said Julian, with his ready sneer,&#xD;
aside to Valerie.&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Darcy, whose&#xD;
ears were of the quickest, and who often&#xD;
discomfited people by overhearing things&#xD;
which were not intended for him. "I have&#xD;
never suffered much from criticism, because&#xD;
I have never been eminent enough to pro-&#xD;
voke it-but in the little which I have&#xD;
known, I cannot remember to have ever&#xD;
been even momentarily resentful of any&#xD;
thing that was just. Besides, I am thick-&#xD;
&#xD;
skinned, I suppose-at least I am singularly&#xD;
indifferent to the praise or blame of these&#xD;
mouth-pieces of the COUflOSeenti. l3ut I have&#xD;
seen other and more sensitive natures suffer&#xD;
so keenly from their cut-and-thrust attacks,&#xD;
that I have learned to rate them as they' de-&#xD;
serve to be rated, and to remember that&#xD;
lions are sometimes stung to death by gnats."&#xD;
"Yet, if I were an artist, I do not think&#xD;
I should mind them," said Valerie, looking&#xD;
up. "If I had the consciousness of genius&#xD;
to support me, they might sa'y and do their&#xD;
worst. I would fight my way to fame by a&#xD;
longer, but a surer road; for, after all, it is&#xD;
the public, and not the critics, who build up&#xD;
an enduring renown.~~&#xD;
"It was the public, perhaps, in the days&#xD;
when Cimabue painted his Madonnas, and&#xD;
when all Florence made a grand holiday,&#xD;
and strewed flowers in his path," answej~ed&#xD;
Darcy; "but it is not the public in this age,&#xD;
and least of all, in this country. Even in&#xD;
the old-cultured centres of art, the critics&#xD;
lead opinion: here, they simply make it. If&#xD;
every one is not of the same mind with re-&#xD;
gard to a work of art, it is only because their&#xD;
oracles sometimes disagree, not because they&#xD;
take the liberty of judging for themselves&#xD;
concerning its merits."&#xD;
"How very flattering you are!"&#xD;
"Am I? Then it was quite uni~ten-&#xD;
tionally; for I did not think there could be&#xD;
flattery, or the reverse, in merely stating an&#xD;
admitted fact. The general rule in Ameri-&#xD;
ca is a want of artistic culture. But there&#xD;
is no general rule without exceptions; and,&#xD;
judging from my own experience, I should&#xD;
think these exceptions quite numerous."&#xD;
"Judging from the Gazette this morning,&#xD;
perhaps you mean?"&#xD;
"No: for I regard this more as the kind-&#xD;
ness of a friend than the decision of ~ critic.&#xD;
As I said before, however, I am very indif-&#xD;
ferent-too indifferent, I fear-to things of&#xD;
this kind. I work out a conception to the&#xD;
best oP-my ability, according to the manner&#xD;
in which it is given me; more than that I&#xD;
cannot do, at the bidding of all the critics&#xD;
who ever wrote. When I first began to use&#xD;
a brush-and that was as soon as I could&#xD;
use any thing-I chose for my own the mot-&#xD;
to of Van Eyck. You may remember it?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't think I do."&#xD;
"It is 'Ale i/o kan!'-'T'll do my best!'&#xD;
Having done my best, I ciin afford to care&#xD;
very little for what is said of my efforts. I&#xD;
am grateful for praise, especially intelligent&#xD;
praise ~~-his eye glanced toward the paper&#xD;
in his hand-" but I do not work to gain it.&#xD;
I am quite unmoved by fault-finding, be it&#xD;
ever so severe."&#xD;
It was evident that he meant in the full-&#xD;
est sense all the words that he uttered; in-&#xD;
deed, looking at him as he uttered them,&#xD;
nobody could have doubted the fact. It is&#xD;
either the intensely self~distrustful, or the&#xD;
intensely vain, who are easily affected by&#xD;
the outside influences of which he spoke;&#xD;
and, plainly, this man was neither the one&#xD;
nor the other. He was too firmly self-reli-&#xD;
ant for the first; too proud, in the best sense&#xD;
of the word, for the second. Not one of the&#xD;
three people listening to him had any cor-&#xD;
dial liking for him in their hearts; y'et each&#xD;
one of them was forced into a belief of his&#xD;
sincerity, and a half-reluctant admiration of&#xD;
his simple, earnest creed-the creed so far&#xD;
removed from the morbid sensitiveness and&#xD;
overweening self-consciousness which is so&#xD;
often the curse of genius. that it has grown&#xD;
to be recognized as one of its distinguishing&#xD;
characteristics. True, Julian curled his lip&#xD;
and shrugged his shoulders, as he would&#xD;
have done if Raphael himself had spoken;&#xD;
but even he felt the presence of something&#xD;
which had the ring of reality in it, and no-&#xD;
body spoke until Madame Vacquant at last&#xD;
said, lightly:&#xD;
"You shame us all, my dear Maurice;&#xD;
for there are few people nowadays who&#xD;
take life or any thing about life in this spirit.&#xD;
It is terrible to consider. how frivolous and&#xD;
skeptical we have become; and how the&#xD;
taint of cynicism is in every thing we do or I&#xD;
say. As for you-you ~houh1 have been&#xD;
born in the twelfth instead of the nineteenth I&#xD;
century! You would have suited that ex- I&#xD;
aetly."&#xD;
"You pay him a high compliment," said.&#xD;
Valerie. Then she turned abruptly to Dar-&#xD;
cy. "Of course, you have read Montalem- I&#xD;
bert's 'St. Elizabeth,' have you not?"&#xD;
"Yes-long ago."&#xD;
"And of course you remember and ad- ~&#xD;
&#xD;
mire-who does not ?-the matchless intro-&#xD;
duction, in which he gives a living, breath-&#xD;
ing picture of that age of faith where Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant would place you?"&#xD;
"Yes," he said, a little wonderingly.&#xD;
"Well," said the young lady, rising as&#xD;
she spoke, and moving toward the door,&#xD;
which she opened, "I agree with her. I&#xD;
think you ought to have lived then. I think&#xD;
you would have suited that period. But I&#xD;
don't think you suit, or are likely to suit,&#xD;
the age of to-day."&#xD;
The door closed in a way that gave em-&#xD;
phasis to her last words, and effectually cut&#xD;
off all chance of reply, if Darcy had been&#xD;
disposed to make any. lie was by this time&#xD;
used to Miss Aylmer's little amenities, so he&#xD;
only smiled, and then turned to Madame&#xD;
Vacquant.&#xD;
"I am sorry to be obliged to hurry you,&#xD;
madame, but I have an engagement down-&#xD;
street in the course of the next hour or so,&#xD;
and I should not like to break it."&#xD;
"I should not like you to break it on my&#xD;
account, certainly," answered the lady. "I&#xD;
will be ready in a few minutes."&#xD;
She, in turn, left the room; and then,&#xD;
while Darcy was glancing his eye over Mr.&#xD;
Thornton's art critique, Julian roused him-&#xD;
self from the depths of his chair and the&#xD;
depths of his languor sufficiently to say:&#xD;
"I suppose I ought to go too. This"&#xD;
looking down at his velvet morning-coat-&#xD;
"is not exactly en re~gle for Charles Street.&#xD;
What a deuce of a trouble it is-the contin-&#xD;
ual dressing and undressing to which civil-&#xD;
ized humanity is doomed! If I ever commit&#xD;
suicide, it will certainly be from sheer wea-&#xD;
riness on this account. Darcy, my good fel-&#xD;
low, I wonder if the sight of your picture&#xD;
will prove a sufficient reward foZ~ the exer-&#xD;
~ion that lies before me?"&#xD;
"I don't wonder any thing about it-I&#xD;
know it will not," answered Darcy, careless-&#xD;
y. "I hope you are net so foolish as to be&#xD;
;oing down to see my picture, Romney."&#xD;
"I am, though-and why not?"&#xD;
"Because I doubt if you would be repaid&#xD;
or the walk by a master-piece of Oorreggio&#xD;
-and I am sure you will iuot be any thing&#xD;
sear repaid by the inspection of my handi.-&#xD;

&#xD;
"Don't you like it?"&#xD;
"Of course I like it.. In fact it is one of&#xD;
the few things I have ever painted, that sat-&#xD;
isfies me as much as one can be satisfied by&#xD;
one's own execution, I suppose. But you&#xD;
won't like it."&#xD;
"Why not? Is it pre-Ilaphaelite?"&#xD;
Darcy laughed andshruggedhis shoulders.&#xD;
"No: I was infected with the ~Ruskin&#xD;
fever when I was a much younger man, and&#xD;
there has been time enough for the madness&#xD;
to partially subside; but it is not according&#xD;
to flegel and Schelling either, and the ab-&#xD;
sence of the Dftsseldorf element will be a&#xD;
much graver fault in your eyes than the&#xD;
presence of any amount of pre-Raphaclitism,&#xD;
I s~ispcct."&#xD;
"I trust I am not hopelessly biased in&#xD;
my admiration or my views."&#xD;
"Most of us are, I think. But here is&#xD;
Miss Aylmer, and your coat yet unchanged."&#xD;
'Romney started, for, truly enough, the&#xD;
door had opened, and Miss Aylmer in full&#xD;
walking costume stood before him. He&#xD;
rose hastily, made the best excuse he could&#xD;
muster, and went hurriedly to perform his&#xD;
obnoxious toilet duties, while the young&#xD;
lady came forward with an air too negligent&#xD;
t~ have been quite natural.&#xD;
"Pray don't put down your paper," she&#xD;
said, as Darcy laid aside the Gazette. "I&#xD;
am going straight to the piano-I always do&#xD;
when I am waiting-and I won't disturb&#xD;
you in the least. I know how provoking it&#xD;
is to he disturbed, especially when one is&#xD;
pleasantly engaged."&#xD;
Whatever Darcy's other social short-&#xD;
comings, want of tact was certainly not one&#xD;
of them. Some men would have been fool-&#xD;
ish enough to have persisted in laying aside&#xD;
the paper, and in forcing the fact of their&#xD;
presence upon a reluctant companion; but&#xD;
this man 'was never one to fall into such a&#xD;
vulgar error. On the contrary, he took up&#xD;
the Gazette again, and,'with a quiet bend of&#xD;
the head in acknowledgment of the lady's&#xD;
consideration, devoted himself to the polit-&#xD;
ical-intelligence column with very edifying&#xD;
assiduity, while she sat down to the piano&#xD;
and amused herself with modulating the&#xD;
soft chords and harrnonieus of the "Conso-&#xD;
lation I,'&#xD;
&#xD;
They were still t~te-d-t6te in this in-&#xD;
teresting' fashion when Madame Yacquant&#xD;
came back, and, Julian soon after following,&#xD;
they set forth.&#xD;
Of course, there was no hesitation about&#xD;
the order of march. The elder lady took&#xD;
quiet but undisputed possession of Darcy,&#xD;
and entertained him with high-art criti-&#xD;
cisms and Huskin quotations down the whole&#xD;
length of Charles Street, to the very door&#xD;
of that charming place of resort which was&#xD;
popularly known as "French's," and official-&#xD;
ly as the "Art Emporium." Here Horn-&#xD;
ney suddenly excused himself. "Since I&#xD;
have come thus far," he said, "I might as&#xD;
well go a little farther, and see one or two&#xD;
troublesome people on a troublesome matter&#xD;
of business. I will be back in about half an&#xD;
hour. I suppose you wrn have exhausted&#xD;
your raptuyes by that time, and I can ad-&#xD;
mire the picture at my leisure."&#xD;
He lifted his hat-bowed-smiled-van-&#xD;
ished-while the others, by no means dis-&#xD;
consolate at his departure, entered the se-&#xD;
rene and somewhat dim region (it would be&#xD;
sacrilege to call it a shop), the popularity&#xD;
of which as a lounging resort needed no ex-&#xD;
planation after a ~ingle glance at the vista&#xD;
of beauty which opened at once on the gaze.&#xD;
It speaks well for the taste of the multitude&#xD;
that, provided they can obtain the luxury&#xD;
free of cost, they always like to be sur-&#xD;
rounded by things that embody the beau-&#xD;
tiful; and that, even in a community which&#xD;
is substantially unheedful and unappreciative&#xD;
of art, any gallery thrown open to the public&#xD;
is sure of being wellpatronized by sight-seers.&#xD;
Wise legislators and wise philanthropists,&#xD;
knowing this, provide such places of resort,&#xD;
and so, by indirect means, educate the pop.&#xD;
ular taste, and, by slow degrees, bring into&#xD;
the barren popular life some of the soften-&#xD;
ing and grace that comes alone of beauty&#xD;
as we know it in art; but, such legislators&#xD;
and such philanthropists being rarer than&#xD;
precious jewels in America~ the careless&#xD;
majority, as well as the art-loving minority,&#xD;
are fair to content themselves with and be&#xD;
grateful for such substitutes as this "Em-'&#xD;
porium" of Mr. French. Yet there have&#xD;
been worse ones, even in an artistic sense&#xD;
It was certainly a beautiful place-a place&#xD;
&#xD;
where pictures~in gleaming frames rose tier&#xD;
after tier on the walls; where groups of&#xD;
statuary, in all their white motionless grace,&#xD;
met the eye on every side; where alabaster&#xD;
vases and Parian statuettes abounded; and&#xD;
where there were always to be found the&#xD;
finest specimens of marqueterie and the&#xD;
rarest trifles of vert~&amp;amp; that enterprise could&#xD;
command or wealth obtain - a place, too,&#xD;
where the real connoisseur was always cer-&#xD;
tain of being able to find good paintings at&#xD;
terms not-well, not extravagant. If Mr.&#xD;
French demanded a good price for a good&#xD;
thing, it was no more than he had an un-&#xD;
doubted right to do; and people who spent&#xD;
their annual thousands on dresses and horses&#xD;
and jewels, had the grace not to grumble&#xD;
overmuch at the necessity of paying a few&#xD;
hundreds now and then for the privilege of&#xD;
hanging a picture worth calling a picture&#xD;
on their walls-especially since they knew&#xD;
that these hundreds would go to the artist,&#xD;
and not to the convenient agent who trans-&#xD;
acted the business and pocketed the profits.&#xD;
From this well-known and very common&#xD;
character Mr. French was indeed as com-&#xD;
pletely distinct as it is possible to imagine&#xD;
two things. He was far less dealer, than&#xD;
gentleman, far less merchant than liberal&#xD;
patron and lover of ttrt. In his eyes, the&#xD;
laborer was always worthy of his hire; and&#xD;
no artist had ever known him buy a picture&#xD;
for one price and triple or quadruple the&#xD;
amount when he sold it to some wealthy&#xD;
dilettant. "Fair profits are one thing," he&#xD;
was accustomed to say, "and gross robbery&#xD;
is quite another. I would as soon steal a&#xD;
man's purse as to buy his picture for a song&#xD;
and sell it for a fortune." And no one had&#xD;
ever been able to say'that these principles&#xD;
belied themselves. On the contrary, he had&#xD;
made mat~y a noble outlay, and done many&#xD;
a generous deed which his right hand-&#xD;
that is, the world-never suspected, but&#xD;
which those wham he benefited not only&#xD;
knew, but remembered so well, that his&#xD;
praises were sounded far ani wide among&#xD;
the genial art' brotherhood.&#xD;
Groups of people were loitering about,&#xD;
admiring various pictures, criticizing various&#xD;
statuettes, moving softly, and speaking with&#xD;
the well-modulated voice of well-bred con-&#xD;
&#xD;
versation, when the two ladies attended by&#xD;
Darcy entered. They did not pause, how-&#xD;
ever, but passed directly up a flight of stairs&#xD;
to a room above-a room that was evidently&#xD;
the adytum of this sanctuary of art. It could&#xD;
not have been called a gallery, for it was of&#xD;
moderate size, finished with the simple ele-&#xD;
gance of a drawing-room, and containing&#xD;
only three or four pictures, together with a&#xD;
beautiful marble group which occupied the&#xD;
centre of the floor. But even a tyro's glance&#xD;
would have seen at once that each of the&#xD;
three or four pictures were works of the&#xD;
highest excellence, and the names attached&#xD;
were of world-wide fame; yet none of them&#xD;
at present occupied the place of honor-a&#xD;
position at the head of the room where the&#xD;
light fell broad, and full from a carefully-&#xD;
toned sky-window-this was reserved for&#xD;
the new painting, before which an attentive&#xD;
group were standing when the three entered.&#xD;
"Pray, let us wait until those people go,"&#xD;
said Valerie, sinkiri~ down on a divan. "If&#xD;
there is one thing I detest more than an-&#xD;
other, it is looking at a picture over half a&#xD;
dozen shoulders."&#xD;
"I am rather tired, and a rest will be&#xD;
pleasant," said Madame Yacquant,. follow-&#xD;
ing her example.-" Maurice, don't let us de-&#xD;
tain you. I see Mr. French wants to speak&#xD;
to you.~~&#xD;
She gave a gracious bow to the pleasant-&#xD;
faced, gentlemanly man, who came forward&#xD;
from the group aforesaid, and drew Darcy&#xD;
aside; then sank back, and devoted her-&#xD;
self to a landscape opposite, until the knot&#xD;
of people passed from before the picture,&#xD;
and, with a few last words to Darcy~ Mr.&#xD;
French accompanied them from the room.&#xD;
Then Maurice came forward. A value man,&#xD;
or a man more distrr~stful of his own powers,&#xD;
might have been fluttered by the ordeal be~&#xD;
fore him; but he only smiled quietly, as he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Will you both come and tell me what&#xD;
you think of my work?"&#xD;
They both came and stood before it-.&#xD;
each secretly steeled against admiration.&#xD;
This was what they saw:&#xD;
A deep woodland glade-~--a sort of delI it&#xD;
seemed-in the' heart of an almost tropical&#xD;
forest. Save f~r the want of sufficient depth&#xD;

VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
A DECLARATION-NOT OF LOVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
of coloring, and the lack of gorgeous para-&#xD;
sites, the character of the scenery might&#xD;
have been identified with that of Mexico or&#xD;
Brazil, but as it was-with the fresh, eme-&#xD;
rald verdure, the familiar forms of the well-&#xD;
known forest - trees, the graceful swinging&#xD;
creepers, and, farther back, the long, draping&#xD;
gray moss that gave its only funereal aspect&#xD;
to the scene-there was no mistaking the&#xD;
royal forest that, with little break or change&#xD;
of character, clothes our fair land, from the&#xD;
Potomac to the Rio Grande; deepening only&#xD;
in luxuriance and beauty as it sweeps down&#xD;
from the green Carolina hills to the golden&#xD;
sands of the Mexic Gulf. Far back into&#xD;
dim distance stretched awall of liv~ig green,&#xD;
*but the foreground of the picture was en-&#xD;
tirely occupied by the nook that formed an&#xD;
island in the midst of this ocean of tangled&#xD;
verdure. Here the light fell soft and dim&#xD;
through the shade of overhanging boughs,&#xD;
and the short turf was green and smooth as&#xD;
any garden lawn; here, also, it was evident&#xD;
that the artist had striven to embody the&#xD;
exuberant fullness of rejoicing with which&#xD;
Nature sometimes breaks forth, filling all&#xD;
inanimate creation with that pulse of joy&#xD;
which thrilled it on the creation morning.&#xD;
The spring that bubbled up between the&#xD;
roots of a giant live-oak, the graceful wil-&#xD;
low that bent to touch the stream, as it glided&#xD;
away, the flowering vines that fringed its&#xD;
course, the large moss-covered stones, the&#xD;
fresh, emerald grass, the golden sunbeams&#xD;
that glinted and quivered down through the&#xD;
thick canopy of leaves, the bright-eyed bird&#xD;
that arched its dainty neck to drink a fairy&#xD;
draught of water, even the lizard that sunned&#xD;
itself luxuriously on a fallen log-had all been&#xD;
touched by a brush that lingered lovingly&#xD;
and carefully over eac~i detail. And, in the&#xD;
midst of this glad and lavish loveliness, there&#xD;
lay stretched the dead figure of a soldier-&#xD;
thrown as if in the careless grnce of slumber&#xD;
beside the stream. There were no signs of&#xD;
strife to mar the sylvan quiet, no trampled&#xD;
grass, nor bloody tokens of mortal hate, and&#xD;
deadly carnage-only the overflowing vi-&#xD;
tality of Nature in contrast with the man&#xD;
who, like a wounded hart, had crept to this&#xD;
covert to die-only Life mocking the still&#xD;
presence of Death. The uniform was that of&#xD;
&#xD;
a private in the Confederate army- the&#xD;
worn and faded gray-but no roughness of&#xD;
costume could conceal the fact that it was a&#xD;
gentleman who had lain down there to die.&#xD;
There was not a personal mark that did not&#xD;
tell the story of gentle blood and gentle rear-&#xD;
ing. The slender build of form, the finely.&#xD;
tapering extremities, the white and delicate&#xD;
hand thrown up over the soft, silken curls,&#xD;
and the clear, handsome outline of face (the&#xD;
gazer could almost ~ee the gray death-shade&#xD;
stealing over it, and feel how proud and&#xD;
beautiful those dark eyes must have been be-&#xD;
fore the long lashes fell over them forever),&#xD;
were all eloquent of culture, hereditary as&#xD;
well as personal. One glove lay on the&#xD;
grass, and near it the soldier's overturned&#xD;
cup; while, farther away, the carbine rested&#xD;
where it had dropped from the failing grasp.&#xD;
The other clinched hand held a handker-&#xD;
chief to the ghastly wound upon the chest,&#xD;
from which a dark-red tide poured on the&#xD;
velvet mosses; and over the whole picture&#xD;
brooded a pathos unutterable. Few eyes&#xD;
could have looked on it undimmed, and it&#xD;
was not strange that, after a moment, Vale-&#xD;
rie was raining a shower of tears beneath&#xD;
her veil, while even Madame Vacquant was&#xD;
subdued and silent. When she did at last&#xD;
speak, it was in that hushed tone which in-&#xD;
voluntarily we adopt in a death-chamber,&#xD;
for truly it seemed more as if the reality&#xD;
than the shadow was present here.&#xD;
"Maurice, it is beautiful-it is wonder-&#xD;
full I almost feel as if the poor fellow had&#xD;
just died before me! But what is the name&#xD;
of it?"&#xD;
"Missing," he answered, briefly,&#xD;
"Nothing more?"&#xD;
"Nothing more."&#xD;
"What more would you have?" asked&#xD;
Valerie, speaking with an effort. "Only&#xD;
it reminds me of something-I scarcely&#xD;
know what."&#xD;
"Perhaps I can tell you,7~ said Darcy,&#xD;
with a smile. "Is it not of an anony-&#xD;
mous poem which appeared during the war&#xD;
under that title? I thought it exquisite;&#xD;
and it suggested this to me."&#xD;
"Yes-I remember now," she said.&#xD;
And then in a low voice, often broken, she&#xD;
repeated two verses:&#xD;
&#xD;
"'In the cool, sweet hush of a wooded nook,&#xD;
where the May-buds sprinkle the green old sward,&#xD;
And the winds, and the birds, and the limpid brook,&#xD;
Mingle their strains with a drowsy sound,&#xD;
Who lies so still in the plushy moss-&#xD;
His pale face pressed on a grassy pillow-&#xD;
Just where the light and the shadows cross,&#xD;
In the flickering fringe of the willow-&#xD;
Who lies, alas!&#xD;
So still, so chill, in the whispering grass?&#xD;
"'A soldier clad In Zonave dress,&#xD;
A bright-haired man, with his lips apart?&#xD;
Onehand thrownup o'er the frank, dead face,&#xD;
The other clutching his pulseless heart,&#xD;
Lies here in the shadows cool and dim,&#xD;
His musket swept by a trailing bough,&#xD;
Withi~ careless grace in each quiet limb-&#xD;
But a wound on the manly brow-&#xD;
Awound, alas?&#xD;
Whence the warmbl3od drips on the quiet grass I ~&#xD;
After that, they were silent a long&#xD;
time.&#xD;
Finally, however, Madame Vacquant&#xD;
looked at her watch, and said that she must&#xD;
go. She remembered a dozen things she&#xD;
wanted, and especially that she meant to&#xD;
look in at Easter's, and see if it was possi-&#xD;
ble to find there a piece of velvet that&#xD;
matched her purple silk. She turned to&#xD;
Miss Ayjmer.&#xD;
"Valerie, will you come? We can leave&#xD;
a message with Mr. French, telling Julian&#xD;
where to find us."&#xD;
"I believe I would rather remain, if you&#xD;
will excuse me," said Valerie. "Easter's&#xD;
is farther down, is it not? Then you call&#xD;
for me on your return. I have not seen:&#xD;
half enough of this picture yet."&#xD;
She kept her seat on the sofa that Darcy&#xD;
had wheeled forward, with evidently not&#xD;
the least intention of stirring; so Madame&#xD;
Vacquant looked at Maurice. "Do you&#xD;
stay too?" she asked, a little significantly.&#xD;
Before he could reply, Valerie answered&#xD;
promptly:&#xD;
"No. I would not think of keeping Cap-&#xD;
tam Darcy. Pray take him with you, for it&#xD;
cannot be very interesting to sit and look at&#xD;
one's own picture."&#xD;
"More interesting than you would im-&#xD;
agine," he said, with a laugh; but he add-&#xD;
ed, turning to Madame Vacquant: "Of&#xD;
course I am at your service for Easter's or&#xD;
elsewhere."&#xD;
She accepted the offer very graciously,&#xD;
&#xD;
and they left the room together. Then&#xD;
Valerie leaned back with a deep sigh of re-&#xD;
lief, and, resting her cheek on her hand,&#xD;
looked steadily at the canvas before her-&#xD;
looked until the lines wavered and grew&#xD;
dim, and the pale, handsome face of the&#xD;
dead soldier seemed resting in a mist. She&#xD;
had only just raised her hand to dash away&#xD;
the obtrusive tears, when a familiar step&#xD;
made her turn quickly, and she faced Darcy,&#xD;
who was entering the room.&#xD;
Perhaps she did not care to dissemble&#xD;
her not-very-well-pleased surprise. Her first&#xD;
words were:&#xD;
"I thought you accompanied Madame&#xD;
Vacquant."&#xD;
"Madame Vacquant was kind enough&#xD;
to dispense with my attendance," he said.&#xD;
"She found Mrs. Jennings down-stairs, and&#xD;
they have gone together, after agreeing that&#xD;
I would doubtless make but a poor appraiser&#xD;
of silks and laces. So I came back-glad to&#xD;
find you still alone."&#xD;
Now, in the course of her life, a great&#xD;
many people, at a great many different&#xD;
times, had been glad to find Valerie alone;&#xD;
so that the formula was quite a familiar one&#xD;
to her ears. But it was certainly the last&#xD;
she had ever expected to hear from Maurice&#xD;
Darcy. Of course she did not misunderstand&#xD;
him, or fancy, for a moment, that whatever&#xD;
he wished with her could bear a tender sig-&#xD;
nificance; but still, all things considered, it&#xD;
was scarcely wonderful that the large eyes&#xD;
opened in her astonishment.&#xD;
~ she said. "Of course I am still&#xD;
alone. Did you expect to find any one with&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"No," he answered, with his cool, quiet&#xD;
smile, which she never exactly understood,&#xD;
and therefore never exactly fancied. "But,&#xD;
luck favors me so seldom-and this is luck&#xD;
-that I can afford to be incredulous when&#xD;
there does come a manifestation. May I sit&#xD;
down? I have something to say to you&#xD;
which I hope will not take very long; but&#xD;
one may as well talk at one~s ease."&#xD;
She bent her head a little, and swept&#xD;
back her flowing draperies, so as to leave the&#xD;
other end of the divan clear; then she said&#xD;
carelessly:&#xD;
"I confess I am at a loss to imagine&#xD;
&#xD;

U'1&#xD;
&#xD;
VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
A DECLARATION-NOT or LOVE~&#xD;
&#xD;
what you can possibly have to say to me in&#xD;
-in this way."&#xD;
"You would hardly be likely to guess,"&#xD;
he said, with another flitting smile. "it is&#xD;
seldom, I fancy, that you have been enter-&#xD;
tained by matters so prosaic as legacies and&#xD;
rights of inheritance. Nay, you need not&#xD;
start~"-she had started very perceptibly-&#xD;
"I will not bore you if I can help it."&#xD;
But here she interrupted him, her face&#xD;
flushing slightly:&#xD;
"I don't. know that you need trouble&#xD;
yourself to explain any thing, Captain Dar-&#xD;
cy. I already understand 'the nature of our&#xD;
conflicting claims, and, if the matter at all&#xD;
rested with me, would be perfectly willing&#xD;
to waive mine-but it does not do so.&#xD;
Grandpapa alone can decide about his fu-&#xD;
hire arrangements; and you must excuse&#xD;
me if I decline entering into a discussion&#xD;
from which no good can possibly ensue."&#xD;
She spoke in her usual clear, silvery&#xD;
tone, fluently and without hesitation. Dar-&#xD;
cyheard her to the close, and then answered&#xD;
calmly:&#xD;
"And you must excuse me if I still press&#xD;
my desire to be heard. Perhaps I had bet-&#xD;
ter begin by explaining that you totally mis-&#xD;
understand all that I wish to say. You&#xD;
speak of 'conflicting claims '-there I must&#xD;
beg leave to correct you. No claims of&#xD;
mine do, or possibly can, conflict with&#xD;
yours."&#xD;
She looked up at him-thinking in her&#xD;
heart, the while, that he was even a subtler&#xD;
schemer than she had fancied, or else he&#xD;
would net attempt to spllt hairs in this way,&#xD;
and waved her hand with a slight gesture of&#xD;
scorn, as she answered:&#xD;
"What does it matter? You know&#xD;
what I mean-even although I may have&#xD;
used terms that were a shade incorrect. I&#xD;
do not see that it makes any material differ-&#xD;
~nce whether you have a claim on grand-&#xD;
papa, or whether he enriches you by his&#xD;
own free will. Once more, believe me that&#xD;
the matter is not of sufficient importance to&#xD;
me for jrour definitions to prove of interest."&#xD;
"And once more I must be uncivil&#xD;
enough to force them on you," lie said, be-&#xD;
ginning in turn to speak a little :haughtily.&#xD;
"At least," and the 'tone softened down&#xD;
&#xD;
I again, "for your sake. No, pray don't&#xD;
speak-" as Valerie enclosed her lips evi-&#xD;
dently with that intention-" we shall never&#xD;
get forward, if we keep on talking at cross-&#xD;
purposes. Let me make matters clear, and&#xD;
then you may answer what you please. It&#xD;
will not take me many minutes to do so, for&#xD;
I have not much to say."&#xD;
Still he paused-as if rather uncertain&#xD;
how to say even that much. But Valerie&#xD;
gave him no assistance. She only leaned&#xD;
back silently, waiting for him to speak.&#xD;
After a moment, he resumed-dashing at&#xD;
once and very summarily into the heart of&#xD;
his subject:&#xD;
"I believe you regard me as a mercenary&#xD;
schemer, endeavoring to deprive you of your&#xD;
inheritance. I do not resent the suspicion9&#xD;
It is perhaps natural, for you do not know&#xD;
me. But I ask you to dismiss that appre-&#xD;
hension entirely and forever. I have never&#xD;
had the least intention of accepting any be-&#xD;
quest from my uncle. What his intention&#xD;
has been, I do not know, nor does it matter&#xD;
-since I have already told him explicitly&#xD;
that he must not put my name in his will."&#xD;
The firm, clear tones paused at those&#xD;
words, and Valerie looked up with a start.&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear that," she said, still&#xD;
coldly, but with some appearance of inter-&#xD;
est. "I have been thinking what a good&#xD;
thing it was that grandpapa had found an&#xD;
heir who. seemed to suit him so welL 4s&#xD;
for me, I regret that you, that any one, for&#xD;
that matter, should consider me so merce-&#xD;
nary as to have been coveting this money&#xD;
and not wishing you to have it. As I un-&#xD;
derstand the matter, grandpapa withheld&#xD;
his sister's fortune, and it is only right-it&#xD;
is only common honesty-that he should re-&#xD;
store it to her representative. I have&#xD;
thought so ever since I heard any thing&#xD;
about it. I should indeed feel very great&#xD;
contempt for myself if I had thought any&#xD;
thing else."&#xD;
She spoke quietly, almost indifferently,&#xD;
toying the while with the tassels of her&#xD;
muff; and, when she finished, sank back&#xD;
again into her former: languid attitude.&#xD;
From this, however, Darcy's next words&#xD;
roused her perceptibly-spoken as they&#xD;
were very simply:&#xD;
&#xD;
"This morning my uncle-who seems to&#xD;
share your opinion about conflicting claims&#xD;
-proposed to me a mode of compromise&#xD;
which I should never think of mentioning to&#xD;
you if he had not said that you were already&#xD;
aware of his wishes on the subject. I see&#xD;
you know what I mean."&#xD;
lie might well see, since the blood surged&#xD;
up to the very roots of her hair, and her&#xD;
hand, closing over the silken cord with which&#xD;
she was toying, snapped it quite in two.&#xD;
When she lifted her eyes, they were all&#xD;
ablaze with indignation.&#xD;
"Yes, I have heard of ~ she said. "Do&#xD;
I need to tell you what I thought of it I"&#xD;
"No," he answered. "I have never&#xD;
done 'you such great injustice as to require&#xD;
a word on the subject. Of course, I knew&#xD;
that you would only reject the proposition.&#xD;
But then you did not know that I would be&#xD;
inclined to do likewise; and you might very&#xD;
naturally-perhaps you have-feared serious&#xD;
annoyance from me."&#xD;
Here she interrupted him. "You are&#xD;
mistaken. I have never~ yet feared or en-&#xD;
dured serious annoyance from any one."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, then," he said. "I&#xD;
only thought it probable that I might ac-&#xD;
count in this way for much that has been&#xD;
repellent in your manner toward me. I&#xD;
thought that perhaps you meant to mark&#xD;
decidedly the absence of hope for me; and&#xD;
that it would be well if I put your mind at&#xD;
rest on the subject, by assuring you that I&#xD;
have never for a moment entertained any&#xD;
intention of becoming a suitor for your&#xD;
hand; and furthermore "- the speaker&#xD;
could not restrain this-" that no such in-&#xD;
tention is at all possible in the future."&#xD;
Now, it chanced that Valerie possessed&#xD;
a very keen sense of humor, and this state-&#xD;
ment, at once so explicit and so earnest,&#xD;
struck her with such a sudden sense of the&#xD;
ludicrous, that even vanity was, for the mo-&#xD;
ment, subordinate to amusement, and she&#xD;
startled her companion by an irresistible&#xD;
peal of laughter.&#xD;
"Pray forgive me," she said, after a mo-&#xD;
ment-for it is surprising how a hearty&#xD;
laugh can scatter the mists of ill-humor-&#xD;
"but I really could not help it. I have&#xD;
never in my life been rejected before, and&#xD;
&#xD;
something must be allowed for the novelty&#xD;
of the sensation. You are very kind, but&#xD;
do you think it was necessary to be quite so&#xD;
candid and uncompromising?"&#xD;
"I have always found plain speaking&#xD;
answer best," he replied, "It was an un-&#xD;
complimentary explanation, but I fancied&#xD;
you would pardon theincivility for the sake&#xD;
of the truth. Once for all, set your mind at&#xD;
rest with regard to your inheritance, and&#xD;
believe that you have neither a rival nor a&#xD;
lover to fear in me."&#xD;
He spoke the last words decidedly, and&#xD;
rose at their conclusion. Evidently he had&#xD;
said his say, and meant to go, if Valerie had&#xD;
not made a motion to detain him. With all&#xD;
her faults, there was not in her an atom of&#xD;
the false pride which cannot freely acknowl-.&#xD;
edge an error; so, after a moment, she&#xD;
spoke-hurriedly, as if somewhat doubting&#xD;
her own resolution, but bravely, as if de-&#xD;
termined to go through with it:&#xD;
"You are perfectly right, Captain Darcy.&#xD;
Plain speaking is best; so I hope you will&#xD;
not be surprised that I follow your example~&#xD;
and give you a return of it. The project of&#xD;
which you only heard this morning, I was&#xD;
informed of before I left home;, and I am&#xD;
sure you need be at no loss, to imagine the&#xD;
consequences-even if you had not seen&#xD;
them. I came here against my will, to be&#xD;
placed on exhibition before a man to whom&#xD;
my hand had been offered, as I supposed!&#xD;
That was a pleasant position, don't you.&#xD;
think so? Well, the result was, that I tried&#xD;
to show you that I had no part in such a&#xD;
plan, and that you might keep the fortune&#xD;
forever and a day without my sending a sigh&#xD;
after it. You say that I considered you a&#xD;
mercenary schemer? Frankly, I did. I&#xD;
thought you were here to acquire and retain&#xD;
influence over grandpapa; and, although I&#xD;
never grudged you the fortune-part of it,&#xD;
at least, I thought your right-~till I felt&#xD;
very sincere contempt for the fortune-seek-&#xD;
er. I now recognize the injustice of these&#xD;
opinions, and I am not ashamed to beg your&#xD;
pardon for them."&#xD;
Half-proudly, but very gracefully, she&#xD;
held out her htnd, with a gesture which&#xD;
the veriest churl could scar4~ely have disre-&#xD;
garded; and which made Darcy appreciate,&#xD;

as he had never done before, her singular&#xD;
power of fascination. He only held the&#xD;
little pearl-gloved member for a moment,&#xD;
however; then released it, saying:&#xD;
"You are very good-but we won't&#xD;
speak of pardon at all, if you please. I&#xD;
don't blame you in the least for your opin-&#xD;
ion-as I said before, it was very natural,&#xD;
and scarcely mattered to me at all. I&#xD;
should never have cared to make this expla-&#xD;
nation for my own sake."&#xD;
Valerie looked up, biting her lip a little.&#xD;
Indeed, such a tone would have been apt to&#xD;
irk most women. "I cannot sufficiently ad-&#xD;
mire your frankness," she said, with a very&#xD;
deoi4led dash of sarcasm.&#xD;
"Don't trouble yourself to do ho," Dar-&#xD;
cy answered, with a pleasant laugh. "Peo-&#xD;
ple who admired my frankness would find&#xD;
a good deal to occupy them. And now I&#xD;
leave you to the solitude which I inter-&#xD;
rupted. Will you be kind enough to make&#xD;
my excuses to Madame Yacquant, and say&#xD;
that a business engagement prevents my ac-&#xD;
companying her home?"&#xD;
Valerie bent her head, and, as she made&#xD;
no answer, nor any effort to detain him, he&#xD;
left the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
For the next five minutes, Miss Aylmer's&#xD;
face was a study-amusement, vexation,&#xD;
surprise, and pique, were so plainly mingled&#xD;
there. Then they all suddenly cleared&#xD;
away, and the dark eyes lifted themselves&#xD;
clear and bright, while the lips enclosed in&#xD;
a low laugh.&#xD;
"So my opinion 'scarcely mattered at&#xD;
all! "' she said, with the glance of a ebal-&#xD;
lenged champion. "Truly, I begin to think&#xD;
this haughty gentleman needs a lesson-&#xD;
in good manners, at least. It may prove&#xD;
worth while to give it to him-I have&#xD;
rather a fancy for a man who does not low-&#xD;
er his flag at once-and then he can remem-&#xD;
ber for his comfort q'ira bien ~ue ri~ra le&#xD;
dernier!"&#xD;
It is almost useless to say that to will&#xD;
and to do-in matters of conquest-were&#xD;
quite the same thing with the speaker; but,&#xD;
if she could have foreseen what this resolu-&#xD;
tion was to cost herself and others, she&#xD;
might, perhaps, for once, have paused. She&#xD;
did not foresee it, however; and so she&#xD;
walked on to the end. Doubtless we all .do&#xD;
that, but it goes doubly hard with us when&#xD;
that end-if it be a dark or bitter one-is&#xD;
of our own making.&#xD;
&#xD;
should hardly have been blockhead enough&#xD;
to meet such a woman and forget her."&#xD;
"But perhaps you might-"&#xD;
"There's no perhaps about it! I didn't,&#xD;
I tell you!"&#xD;
"Of course you didn't," said another,&#xD;
laughing. "The thing would be impossible.&#xD;
Don't excite yoi~vself, Hal; for nobody's&#xD;
going to believe it. Even Thornton, cold-&#xD;
blooded as he is, knows it would be impos-&#xD;
sible."&#xD;
"I don't know any thing of the kind,"&#xD;
retorted he of the hearth-rug. "She is i~&#xD;
pretty woman, undoubtedly; but, in those&#xD;
days, men's heads were not running on pret-&#xD;
ty women; and, as it is, I am ,sure I should&#xD;
forget her to-morrow, with any thing of im-&#xD;
portance to drive her from my recollection."&#xD;
"You! Who ever set you up as a stand-&#xD;
ard to go by?"&#xD;
"Nobody, I hope; since he mightreadlly&#xD;
find a better one."&#xD;
"And easily find a worse," said Arle.&#xD;
"Don't abuse yourself; Thornton. It is such&#xD;
bad taste, and so nuziecessary, too, as long&#xD;
as one has any friend left. So this is tke&#xD;
Miss Aylmer," he went on, meditatively;&#xD;
"the same that all those Louisiana fellows&#xD;
used to swear by so tremendously. They&#xD;
called her-~-deuce take my nmnioi~y !-what&#xD;
was it they called her, Darford?"&#xD;
"La belle de8 belles," answered the per-&#xD;
son addressed. "I remembered the name&#xD;
the first moment I saw her. - Strangely&#xD;
enough, too, I i~emembered Estmann's face&#xD;
when he used to spring to his feet-about&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
A TEST OF rownn.&#xD;
* CHRISTMAS had come and gone, and the&#xD;
season was fairly at its height, when, on a&#xD;
certain January evening of sleet and snow,&#xD;
a party of three or four gentlemen were tak-&#xD;
ing their ease, not exactly at an inn, but at&#xD;
our civilized and latter - day substitute-a&#xD;
well-warmed and well-lighted club-house&#xD;
apartment. Their conversation had~ been&#xD;
ranging over many topics, social and other-&#xD;
wise, for some time, until at last it chanced&#xD;
to fall upon the most noted among the&#xD;
reigning belles of the s~son.&#xD;
"It is rather singular," said one of them&#xD;
-Harry Arle, by name-" that all the time&#xD;
I am dancing and talking with her, I feel a&#xD;
positive conviction that I' have seen her&#xD;
somewhere before, and an equally positive&#xD;
incapacity to even imagine where it could&#xD;
have been. The thing tornients me-as a&#xD;
recollection playing at hide-and-seek always&#xD;
will-and is the more remarkable since no-&#xD;
body can say that she is a person likely to&#xD;
be forgotten~."&#xD;
"Decidedly not a person likely to be for-&#xD;
gotten," said one who occupied the hearth-&#xD;
rug, d Z'Anglaise. "It is singular, certainly.&#xD;
But then, after all, you may have met her&#xD;
and forgotten it, Hal. Didn't you seri~e in&#xD;
the trans-Mississippi for a while?"&#xD;
"To be sure I did, but what has that to&#xD;
do with it? If Ihad never heard of Valerie&#xD;

else after I entered the Confederacy-I&#xD;

boys; for here's health and long life to La&#xD;
belle des belles I' Poor fellow! he was about&#xD;
as far gone in the matter of love as I have&#xD;
ever seen anybody; and now he's there,"&#xD;
-the speaker nodded toward the silent Yir-&#xD;
ginia battle-fields--." while she's here."&#xD;
"In full blast, too," ~aid Arle. "Well&#xD;
-such is' life. 'To-day for me, to-morrow&#xD;
for thee,' youknow; so by all means spend&#xD;
to-day as royally as you can. That's the&#xD;
philosophy the times have taught me. Est-&#xD;
mann was not the only one of her victims,&#xD;
though. There was Chrtard of the twenty-&#xD;
ninth-he was killed at Malvern Hill, you&#xD;
know-and Boyd of the Washington Artil-&#xD;
lery; and.-"&#xD;
"Pshaw!" interrupted Thornton. "If&#xD;
you begin counting over her list of killed and&#xD;
wounded, you will find that half the Louisi-&#xD;
ana brigades were spoon about her. She&#xD;
was the standing toast at every mess-table&#xD;
to whThh I ever was invited; and I am sure&#xD;
that. at least one-third of the 'field-pieces&#xD;
were named after her. Do you remember&#xD;
that splendid mare Alston had shot under&#xD;
him at Ohancellorsvile? I really believe he&#xD;
hated the loss of the creature, principally&#xD;
because she was named 'La belle dee belles."&#xD;
"Well, can anybody tell me what is the&#xD;
secret of it all?" asked Number Four,&#xD;
whose name was Stuart, and whoseforte was&#xD;
mild cynicism and skepticiSm. "She's pret-&#xD;
ty, of course; though a great deal too dark&#xD;
for my taste-but there are plenty other&#xD;
pretty women in the world, and they don't&#xD;
make such a nois&amp;amp; I should really like to&#xD;
know the secret of it."&#xD;
"You'd really like to know the origin of&#xD;
evil too, wouldn't you?" asked Arle, laugh-&#xD;
ing. "The questions are equally abstruse,&#xD;
I take it. At least, I h~'re known a great&#xD;
many wise men in my life; but I have never&#xD;
yet known any of them wise enough to tell&#xD;
how it is that one pretty woman goes through&#xD;
the world unnoticed, while another, in no&#xD;
degree prettier, is answerable for the imbe-&#xD;
cility of dozens."&#xD;
"I shouldn't think of making her an-&#xD;
swerable for their imbecility," saidThornton.&#xD;
"In oases of this kind, 'a fool's a fool for a'&#xD;
that,' and it would go hard with women if&#xD;
they were made accountable for all the ab-&#xD;
&#xD;
surdity that has their name for its war-&#xD;
rant."&#xD;
"That's where we always disagree," said&#xD;
Darford. "I don't know that it's worth&#xD;
while arguing with you; but my opinion re-&#xD;
mains the same: 'no man ever made a fool&#xD;
of himself without just provocation and en-&#xD;
couragement."&#xD;
"Take care, then, when you come within&#xD;
range of this fairlady," said Arle. "Report&#xD;
has slandered her terribly if she does not un-&#xD;
derstand this provocation and encourage-&#xD;
ment better than any other woman of her&#xD;
day and generation."&#xD;
"Perhaps that is what is the matter with&#xD;
~omney," put in the cynic. "Has anybody&#xD;
noticed a change in him lately?"&#xD;
"For better, or for worse?"&#xD;
"Well, not exactly for either. There's&#xD;
a difference; but I should not feel justified&#xD;
in describing it as an improvement.~~&#xD;
"Perhaps you mean that crimson sling,7~&#xD;
suggested Arle. "It is remarkably becom-&#xD;
ing!"&#xD;
"Hold your envious tongue! " retorted&#xD;
Thornton. "You haven't forgiven him for&#xD;
that walk in the snow yet.-Don't mind his&#xD;
interruption, Stuart. Explain what you&#xD;
mean."&#xD;
"I don't know that I can explain,",said&#xD;
Stuart, in an injured tone. "Anybody that&#xD;
had eyes might have seen it for himself.&#xD;
He isn't as fretful and ready to take offence&#xD;
of late, but he's twice as supercilious and&#xD;
full of self-conceit."&#xD;
"He hasn't played any to speak of since&#xD;
he got well," said Arle, "and that's some-&#xD;
thing remarkable."&#xD;
"Nor flirted any, either," subjoined&#xD;
Darford.&#xD;
"And from these facts you argue that the&#xD;
pretty Prince Charmingis probablynetted!"&#xD;
"Something more than probably, I&#xD;
should say; considering that he is on terms&#xD;
of the most evident intimacy with this fair&#xD;
lady, and, with all his b(ae~ affectations, I&#xD;
really think Romney is sp~ony at bottom."&#xD;
"Oh, he was completely knocked over&#xD;
some time ago," said Darford, carelessly.' "I&#xD;
shouldn't be surprised if he succeeded, too;&#xD;
and, if so, he'll make a good thing o1~it. Ntis~&#xD;
Aylmer is her grandfather's sole heiress.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
"She's got a brother," said Stuart. "&#xD;
met him in Paris this fall."&#xD;
"She's got two of them, for that mat&#xD;
ter," answered Arle, coolly; "but they ar&#xD;
her half-brothers-no relation to NI. Vac&#xD;
quant. I have heard on the best possible&#xD;
authority, however, that he means to leav4&#xD;
the bulk of his fortune to his nephew."&#xD;
"My dear fellow, what do you consider:&#xD;
the best possible authority?"&#xD;
"What do you think of Madame Yac&#xD;
quant I"&#xD;
Darford, who had asked the former ques&#xD;
tion, shrugged his shoulders contempt&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
"I don't think any thing at all. I shouk&#xD;
not trust a statement of hers any further&#xD;
than-I wanted to. She'd say the moon&#xD;
was made of green cheese, if such an asser.&#xD;
tion would serve her purpose in any way.&#xD;
As for this, it's not like h~r habitual caution&#xD;
to speak so openly of a family matter; and&#xD;
that in itself would make me suspect some-&#xD;
thing. Ten to one, Miss Aylmer is the&#xD;
heiress; and she spreads this report to keep&#xD;
the course clear until her pretty darling has&#xD;
come in at the winning-post."&#xD;
"You are right," said Thornton, nodding&#xD;
toward the speaker. "I give you credit for&#xD;
your sagacity. It's not many people who&#xD;
see that far into la madame. For my part,&#xD;
I hold her to be a woman whose diplomatic&#xD;
power is so great that she is simply wasted&#xD;
in her present position. She should have&#xD;
been born to the throne of all the Bus-&#xD;
sias, where she eould have revelled in af-&#xD;
fairs of state to her heart's content. But&#xD;
I can't help hoping it may be true about&#xD;
Darcy's heirship!-~--he is such a capital fel-&#xD;
low!"&#xD;
"He is indeed!" said Arle, warmly-&#xD;
"the very best of fellows! But his picture-&#xD;
painting does not look much as if he were a&#xD;
presumptive inillionnaire, does it? I wish,&#xD;
by-the-way, he'd settle here. We need a&#xD;
first-rate artist deplorably. Wouldn't Miss&#xD;
Rivi~re be enchanted if he did? Do you&#xD;
know, I really think there is something seri-&#xD;
ous in that quarterS I wouldn't blame him,&#xD;
either. She's charming in every thing but&#xD;
the one great essential-..-confound it i-By-&#xD;
the-way, Thornton, you are an~ couranC of&#xD;
&#xD;
I every thing musical can you tell me&#xD;
whether she is really meditating a publi&amp;amp;&#xD;
appearance?"&#xD;
e "Not I," said Thornton. "But, for her&#xD;
own sake, I hope the report is unfounded."&#xD;
e "Why?"&#xD;
o "Simply because she would fail, if she&#xD;
were foolish enough to attempt such a&#xD;
r thing."&#xD;
"I don't see that."&#xD;
"Don't you? Then I trust you never&#xD;
may-that's all."&#xD;
"Have you ever heard her sing?"&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
"Then how the deuce-"&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense, Darford 1 Don't you&#xD;
know Thornton is wholly incredulous of&#xD;
'native talent,' and 'native culture,' and all&#xD;
that sort of thing?" interrupted Arle, laugh-&#xD;
ingly. "He puts his trust in Italian sing-&#xD;
* ers, and disdains every thing below Ger-&#xD;
* man fiddles. I only wonder he ever said a&#xD;
* good word for anybody born this side of&#xD;
the water."&#xD;
"I certainly don't put my trust in ama-&#xD;
teur vocalists, who have had their heads&#xD;
turned by drawing-room applause, and want&#xD;
to carry theirweak falsettos on the boards,"&#xD;
said Thornton, indifferently. "Ihave never&#xD;
heard Miss Rivi~re sing; but I don't know&#xD;
where she would stow away a voice in that&#xD;
childish figure of hers; at all events, she had&#xD;
better think twice before she comes before&#xD;
the public."&#xD;
"Then there's Bomney," said Stuart-&#xD;
not very relevantly, as it seemed. "I've&#xD;
always thought it a pity he would not try&#xD;
the lyric stage. He has a capital tenor, and&#xD;
the profession would suit him. The perpet-&#xD;
ual incense and flattery might do sometls~ng'&#xD;
toward soothing that chronic discontent of&#xD;
his, if any thing could."&#xD;
"A proviso well ndi od," said Arle,&#xD;
throwing away the burning en~l of his cigar.&#xD;
"At least if he ever doestake ~siich a step, I&#xD;
should be profoundly thankful that Fate did'&#xD;
not make a stage-manager of me. Now,&#xD;
dp~vpQe dee bottle, who is opera-bound t&amp;amp;&#xD;

"All of u14 I' fancy~" said Darford. "Do&#xD;

&#xD;
cousins on my hands.-Thornton, do you&#xD;
take anybody?"&#xD;
Thornton shook his head. He rarely&#xD;
took anybody in the way Darford meant.&#xD;
"No," he said. "I need to keep my&#xD;
ears open-as I shall have to tell to-morrow&#xD;
how often the tenor sang B natural when he&#xD;
ought to have sting B fiat-and if you ever&#xD;
succeeded in doing that with a woitian by&#xD;
* your side, it is more than I huve. No mat-&#xD;
ter whether a cavatina or a duo is going on,&#xD;
the pretty creatures 'will prattle about the&#xD;
basso's eyes and the prima donna's dress!&#xD;
Is it an off-night of escort-duty with either&#xD;
of you two?"&#xD;
"Not with me," said Stuart, gloomily.&#xD;
"I half promised Violet to come back,"&#xD;
said ArIa; "but I doubt if she expects me&#xD;
-the Tracys were to call for her anyway."&#xD;
"Then you'll come with ~ said&#xD;
Thornton, "and, after. the opera, we'll ad-&#xD;
journ for supper to Guy's."&#xD;
"Agreed."&#xD;
Then the quartet broke up.&#xD;
An hour or two later, when Messieurs&#xD;
Arle and Thornton were shown to their&#xD;
stalls in the parquet of a crowded house,&#xD;
they found the saat adjoining them already&#xD;
occupied by a gentleman who, turning round&#xD;
on their entrance, proved to be Darcy. Sal-&#xD;
utations were cordially exchanged, and then,&#xD;
while he and Thornton fell into animated&#xD;
conversation, Arle screwed his lorgnette&#xD;
into place, and applied himself to a survey&#xD;
of the scene. It was a very brilliant one;&#xD;
for with the exception of a ballroom, there&#xD;
are few prettier sights than an opera-house&#xD;
-especially in Baltimore. From the dress.&#xD;
circle down to the verge of the orchestra,&#xD;
there was a perfect sweep of light and&#xD;
beauty, of fleecy dresses, and downy opera&#xD;
cloaks, of waving fans and gleaming jewels&#xD;
of fair hair elaborately arranged, and faii&#xD;
faces brightly smiling, until the coup d'eeii&#xD;
was of almost dazzling effect. To one keen.&#xD;
ly alive to such impressions, it was an over&#xD;
ture in itself, this bright gala-picture, this&#xD;
surging, flashing sea of human life pew&#xD;
within these narrow walls at the bidding ci&#xD;
a thousand different caprices, and broke&#xD;
into a thousand different waves of though&#xD;
&#xD;
and feeling that were all soon to be toned&#xD;
to the beating of one great pulse by the ne-&#xD;
big harmonies of the mighty power of music.&#xD;
Arle recognized a dozen acquaintances, and&#xD;
bestowed at least a dozen bows in half as&#xD;
many minutes, when suddenly his glass&#xD;
stopped short in ifs transit round the glitter-&#xD;
ing horseshoe, and remained fixed on one&#xD;
of the right-hand proscenium-boxes.&#xD;
Nor was his the only one thus attracted,&#xD;
for Miss Aylmer had just entered, and taken&#xD;
her seat behind the curtains, drawing them&#xD;
back with one handwhie her glance nwept&#xD;
over the house as quietly and indifferently&#xD;
as though from every part of it the ivory-&#xD;
mounted "double-barrels" had not been&#xD;
levelled upon her. There is a great deal in&#xD;
the consciousness of looking well to support&#xD;
a woman under such a scrutiny, however-&#xD;
and Valerie had never looked better. She&#xD;
was not at all one of the people whom the&#xD;
French have in mind when they say, con-&#xD;
temptuously, that by artificial light it is im-&#xD;
possible to tell a woman from a gnat-but&#xD;
she "lighted up" splendidly. If she was&#xD;
beautiful in ordinary dress, and by broad&#xD;
daylight, she was something positively daz-&#xD;
zling in evening costume, and amid evening&#xD;
surroundings. She was now evidently&#xD;
dressed for some after-ball, for, when she&#xD;
loosened and partially threw back the soft&#xD;
mass of cashmere and swan's-down that did&#xD;
duty for a cloak, her shoulders gleamed like&#xD;
polished marble above a corsage of rose-c9l-&#xD;
ored silk cut d la Grecque, and the shimmer&#xD;
of large pearls encircled her throat. In her&#xD;
masses of raven hair-no chignon or water-&#xD;
fall monstrosity had been called into play&#xD;
.-the same beautiful gems gleamed with&#xD;
their soft, fitful light, while her cheeks&#xD;
glowed, her eyes shon4, and her whole face&#xD;
was so full of beauty-so like in tint to a&#xD;
fervid tropical blossom-that even the im-&#xD;
passive Thornton murmured as he lowered&#xD;
his glass:&#xD;
"La belle dee belles indeed! No wonder&#xD;
she does so much mischief-.only I should&#xD;
think she would have accomplished her ap-&#xD;
L pointed share by this time."&#xD;
"Look at Romney, if you want to see&#xD;
i. about that," said Arle, with a laugh. "No&#xD;
L doubt of his being hard hit, eh, Darcy?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"L'amour et la fum~e tie peuvant ec&#xD;
caclier," answered Darcy, turning one care-&#xD;
less glance on the handsome face and silken&#xD;
sling that appeared just behind Valerie's&#xD;
white shoulder. Then the overture clashed&#xD;
forth, and there was silence with the trio.&#xD;
Not so, however, in the box which, beside&#xD;
Miss Aylmer and her cavalier, held~ Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant and a certain ami de la mai-&#xD;
eon-Harvey Wilmer by naine-who was&#xD;
the most convenient person imaginable for&#xD;
hack-duty, being always ready to play es-&#xD;
cort at a moment's notice, and never of-&#xD;
fended or disquieted at being dropped with&#xD;
any amount of summary haste. When the&#xD;
overture began, he had just discovered Mau-&#xD;
rice Darcy's presence in the house, and an-&#xD;
nounced the fact to his companion.&#xD;
She nodded, with a smile.&#xD;
"He has been in Richmond for a day or&#xD;
~ she said, "and I quite forgot his in-&#xD;
tended return when I asked you to accom-&#xD;
pany us. Of course, after that, I had no seat&#xD;
to offer him. He promised to look in dur-&#xD;
ing the evening, however. Is not some one&#xD;
entering the opposite box? I will trouble&#xD;
you for my&#xD;
The glasses were surrendered and fixed&#xD;
just in time to catch the timid grace with&#xD;
which a dainty, brown-eyed girl entered the&#xD;
box in question, and, without throwing off&#xD;
her wrappings, at once eank out of sight&#xD;
behind the curtains, ~while a pale, elegant&#xD;
woman advanced to the front with a high-&#xD;
bred composure which was very perfect.&#xD;
They were quite alone, and Madame Yac-&#xD;
quant lowered her lorgnette with something&#xD;
of a shrug.&#xD;
"Mrs. Rividre and Alix," she said.&#xD;
"They make a point of being present at&#xD;
* every thing musical, I believe-p-and rarely&#xD;
accept an escort. There must be some&#xD;
foundation for the rumor that~- Ah! the&#xD;
curtain is going up!"&#xD;
The opera was "Faust;" and since this&#xD;
was among its earliest representations in&#xD;
Baltimore, quite a hush reigned over the&#xD;
house during the act which ensued. The&#xD;
Marguerite of the occasion was one who,&#xD;
since then, has almost made the r61e her&#xD;
own-playing it with unbounded applause&#xD;
before the most critical audiences of the Old&#xD;
&#xD;
World; but, though she has gained power&#xD;
and culture, none who see her to-day will&#xD;
say that she has gained grace and expres-&#xD;
sion since she charmed us in those early&#xD;
days, when she came shyly moving across&#xD;
the stage in her peasant kirtle, with her&#xD;
downcast eyes, and a missal closely clasped&#xD;
in her slender hands. When the act ended,&#xD;
there was a surging movement all over the&#xD;
house, as of some anxiety safely passed;&#xD;
then, while the tribute of enthusiasm was&#xD;
still echoing, Darcy and Arle rose with one&#xD;
accord from their seats.&#xD;
"Of course," said Thornton, "you do&#xD;
well to be in haste-if you want even so&#xD;
much as a smie-~.for there are plenty more&#xD;
moving in the same direction. I take it for&#xD;
granted you are both going there?"&#xD;
He nodded toward the box where Va-&#xD;
lena was already holding court; but Dan-&#xD;
cy shook his head.&#xD;
"Arle may speak for himself," he said;&#xD;
"but I am bound for quite another part.&#xD;
How is it, Hal? You are going there?&#xD;
He moved away, and a few minutes later&#xD;
opened the door of the box that contained&#xD;
Mrs. Rivi~r~ and her daughter. Both ladies&#xD;
turned round on his entrance, and both of&#xD;
their faces brightened so cordially that it&#xD;
was easy to see what a welcome visitor he&#xD;
was. A familiar visitor, too, their gteetings&#xD;
proved; and the sweet face of the girl&#xD;
looked pleased and happy as that of a child,&#xD;
when he sat down by her, and- asked how&#xD;
she liked the prima douna. Her raptures&#xD;
made him srniea little; but he listened to&#xD;
them, with that indulgent air which plainly&#xD;
shows that even nonsense from the lips of&#xD;
the speaker would be pleasant; and, us he&#xD;
listened, he also.-looked.&#xD;
Artist as ha was, he had certainly rarely&#xD;
seen a prettier sight at which t~i look. No-&#xD;
body had ever called Alix Bivibre beautiful,&#xD;
and probably nobody, ever 4~vould do so,&#xD;

A TEST OF POWER.&#xD;
&#xD;
86                       VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
rarely noticed how exquisitely delicate was&#xD;
the one, how perfect in symmetry was the&#xD;
other. They said she was "lovely" and&#xD;
"charming," and a dozen other things be-&#xD;
sides,' and they knew that she was as grace-&#xD;
ful and fresh as a wild-flower of her native&#xD;
woods; but they never opened their eyes&#xD;
to see what a refined and dainty beauty she&#xD;
really possessed. Darcy saw it to-night,&#xD;
however.-~-saw the fitful blushes coming and&#xD;
going under the transparent skin, saw the&#xD;
sweet curl of the flexible lips, the clear, clas-&#xD;
sical outline of feature and head, the coronal&#xD;
of brown curls, silken as the plumage of a&#xD;
bird, and waving all around the fair, open,&#xD;
childlike brow-a brow in form and shape&#xD;
like Mozart's-and, above all, the large&#xD;
brown eyes, full of soft gloom, and deeply&#xD;
set. under the arched brows. Once only he&#xD;
glanced away from her-glanced aci~oss the&#xD;
house, to the vivid face just opposite-and&#xD;
then back again. It was, after this, that he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"What is the reasout you have been am-&#xD;
buscading in this dark corner all the even-&#xD;
ing? I watched for even so much as a&#xD;
glimpse of yow-but .1 watched vainly.&#xD;
There are not so many fair fates here to-&#xD;
night that we can afford to dispense with&#xD;
one of the fairest."&#xD;
She looked up at him with very genuine&#xD;
rebuke in her eyes.&#xD;
"That do9s not sound like you," she&#xD;
said. "I don't fancy compliments from my&#xD;
friends. To tell the truth, I have kept in&#xD;
the background because I wanted to listen&#xD;
to the music without being interrupted by&#xD;
visitors.. You need not raise your eye-&#xD;
brows. You know I don't mean you. But&#xD;
if. I had .come forward, I should not have&#xD;
been afraid of much observation-with Miss&#xD;
Ayh~er just opposite. Is she not looking&#xD;
brilliantly?"&#xD;
"Very," he answered, quietly; "but I&#xD;
did not know that you especially admired&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"I! Oh, indeed yes. It is a matter of&#xD;
obligation with every Lonisianian to admire&#xD;
La ?i~fle .~.1ee 1)ellea, you know. I think' she&#xD;
is the most beautiful-the very most beauti-&#xD;
fizl woman I ever saw. What a grace and&#xD;
charm there is in her every movement!&#xD;
&#xD;
Look~ Captain Dar~y-.-lobk at that atti-&#xD;
tude!"&#xD;
With a smile, he took the lorguette she&#xD;
eagerly extended, and raised it to his eyes&#xD;
-.-looked for a moment, then lowered it&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"It is a very perfect picture," he said,&#xD;
coolly. "Only, don't you think it is a pity&#xD;
that one feels sure it has been so well&#xD;
studied?"&#xD;
"What do you mean?" she asked, a' lit-&#xD;
tIe wonderingly.&#xD;
"I mean," he answered, carelessly, "Miss&#xD;
Aylmer remembers exactly how many br-&#xD;
gnettes are levelled on her, and knows to a&#xD;
shade how far to advance her hand or ar-&#xD;
range her drapery-not to speak of those&#xD;
smiles and glances which are as plainly&#xD;
stage-effects as the prima donna's flaxen&#xD;
tresses."&#xD;
Alix looked lip-all indignant reproach&#xD;
-but the curtain rose at the moment, and&#xD;
Darcy was spared jhe task of justifying his&#xD;
aspersions. She turned at once to the stage,&#xD;
and for the time being had neither eyes nor&#xD;
,ears for any thing else. Her absorption was&#xD;
so complete, that she was entirely uncon-&#xD;
scious of the interest with which Maurice&#xD;
watched her; or that he smiled at her&#xD;
eagerness as she leaned forward, drinking in&#xD;
every note of the plaintive and beautiful&#xD;
"King of Thulo." She looked up at him&#xD;
when the air was finished, and their eyes&#xD;
met with that fulness of common sympathy&#xD;
which some of us know, or think we know,&#xD;
once or twice in life-but never oftener.&#xD;
"Oh, was itnotexquisite?" sighed the little&#xD;
enthusiast, out of the very depths of her&#xD;
music-loving heart. Then her gaze travelled&#xD;
back to the stage, and soon she was bound&#xD;
in a spell of rapture by the brilliant and&#xD;
difficult strain of the "Air des Bijoux." It&#xD;
was here that Darcy began to share her ab-&#xD;
sorption-that the great prima donna ex-&#xD;
tended the spell of her power over him too.&#xD;
Of course he did not throw himself body&#xD;
and soul into the tide of harmonies, as the&#xD;
trembling, quivering, impressionable nature&#xD;
beside him was doing; but he forgot other&#xD;
surroundings for a space, and was swayed&#xD;
bythe pathos and power of the scene before&#xD;
him. Ab, that matchless music of Gounod!&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Most of us have heard it again and again,&#xD;
and yet we learn a deeper lesson each time&#xD;
that we do hear it, and we go away as if we&#xD;
could never, never learn all its subtle mean-&#xD;
ings and hidden beauties-but will any of us&#xD;
ever forget the hour when we heard it first,&#xD;
when through and through us the mighty&#xD;
pulse of the master's genius rushed till earth&#xD;
seemed fading away beneath our feet, and&#xD;
the hot, sharp pleasure was more intense&#xD;
than, and almost as bitter as, pain? In the&#xD;
famous "garden-scene," the prima donna's&#xD;
al~aiu~oa of passion, her intensely dramatic&#xD;
powers of acting, her marvellous voice,&#xD;
which momently developed new fulness and&#xD;
compass, held her audience enchained as&#xD;
one man. As one man, that vast, silent&#xD;
crowd hushed its breath-struggled with&#xD;
her-thrilled with her-trembled with her&#xD;
-sank with her into the depths' of woman's&#xD;
loving weakness! When at last the curtain&#xD;
fell, it was not strange that, from gallery to&#xD;
pit, the applause broke forth in one wild&#xD;
storm, rising and falling only to rise again,&#xD;
when a fair, smiling girl, who had nothing in&#xD;
common with poor, impassioned Marguerite,&#xD;
made her appearance before the curtain,&#xD;
bowing her graceful thanks to right and left.&#xD;
Then Alix turned round in a perfect&#xD;
fever of enthusiasm.&#xD;
"Is she not charming? Is she not glori-&#xD;
ous? Ah, who would not be a great canta-&#xD;
trice?" was her cry.&#xD;
"Would you be a great cantatrice in&#xD;
opera?" asked Darcy, a little significantly.&#xD;
She hesitated a moment-then looked up&#xD;
at her mother and smiled. "Well-no,&#xD;
not in opera, I believe. I had forgotten the,&#xD;
acting, and was thinking only of the sing-&#xD;
ing. That is ~o beautiful! I wonder-I&#xD;
wonder-" H~r voice broke down here,&#xD;
but her companion seemed to understand&#xD;
what she meant.&#xD;
"Don't wonder any thing about it," said&#xD;
he, kindly. "Remember that confidence&#xD;
in your own power is sometimes half the&#xD;
battle. The day is not far distant when you&#xD;
will be as well or better known to fame&#xD;
than the singer you have heard to-night."&#xD;
"You are very good to say so, but-"&#xD;
"But what?"&#xD;
"I cannot think so; and indeed I do not&#xD;
&#xD;
care much for it to be so. I love Music so&#xD;
well that I would gladly serve her as bond-&#xD;
woman all my life, without any other rec-&#xD;
ompense than she herself gives. But since&#xD;
that is impossible, since I muat hope, for a&#xD;
little reward, I hope for it in the shape of&#xD;
money, not of fame."&#xD;
"Hush, Alix!" said her mother, laugh-&#xD;
ing. "You shock Captain Darcy by such&#xD;
mercenary avowals."&#xD;
"Captain Darcy does not look shockedd"&#xD;
said Alix, glancing at him shyly. "I am&#xD;
not afraid to talk so before him-he under-&#xD;
stands me."&#xD;
"Yes, I think I do," said Darcy, quickly,&#xD;
and in his heart he truly did. lie under-&#xD;
stood how this sensitive nature shrank from&#xD;
the fierce glare of that publicity which we&#xD;
call fame, and how still more deeply it re-&#xD;
coiled from making merchandise of the ser-&#xD;
vice which was to her-as it is to every true&#xD;
child of music-only a degree less holy than&#xD;
the service of God. In her soul there was&#xD;
music always, her whole life was set to the&#xD;
half-unconscious rhythm of noble harmonies,&#xD;
and there was not a thought or an act of it&#xD;
apart from this great worship; but still, she&#xD;
faced bravely and steadily the necessity of&#xD;
taking these heaven-born powers and inspi-&#xD;
rations into the rude market of the world.&#xD;
It was out of the very depths of her devotion&#xD;
that she said those words which disgust us&#xD;
so often in their sordid application-" I de-&#xD;
sire money, not fame."&#xD;
"I have a favor to ask of you," Darcy&#xD;
said, after a moment's pause. "You dine at&#xD;
my aunt's to-morrow evening, don't you?&#xD;
Yes-I thought so. Well; I want'~you to&#xD;
sing for Thornton!"&#xD;
Alix drew back and looked at him-a&#xD;
good deal surprised, and a little aghast.&#xD;
"For Mr. Thornton-the great musical&#xD;
critic! Oh, Captain Darcy, I would do any&#xD;
thing -almost any thing y~u asked me.&#xD;
But I cannot do that!"&#xD;
"Why not? He is no lion going about&#xD;
to de~rour unwary singers."&#xD;
"Isn't he? Well, I really thought he&#xD;
was, and you must admit that such is his&#xD;
character. ITo, no. I cannot think of it. Ii&#xD;
am sure I should disgrace myself it' I e.vcn~&#xD;
tried-"&#xD;

88                           VALERIE&#xD;
She broke off here, for the box-door&#xD;
opened at that n~oment, and two gentlemen&#xD;
entered. They were not Baltimoreans, but&#xD;
Louisianians, who, chancing to be in the&#xD;
house, had recognized. Mrs. Rivi~re and&#xD;
herdaughter, and came up to renew an old&#xD;
acquaintance. So, rendered quite do trop&#xD;
by the cordial greetings ~nd inquiries which&#xD;
linmediatelytook place, Darcy surrendered&#xD;
his seat to one of them, and went back to&#xD;
Thornton.&#xD;
Meanwhile, matters were not progressing&#xD;
as smoothly as might have been desirable~ in&#xD;
that box where, for the time being, Miss Ayl-&#xD;
mer had established her court. There was,&#xD;
indeed, very serious revolt on hand, though&#xD;
no. one would have suspected as much from&#xD;
the fair sovereign's cloudless brow, and.only&#xD;
a close observer could have detected an oc-&#xD;
casional glance stealing now and then tow-&#xD;
ard the; dark corner where, moody and jeal-&#xD;
otis, Romney had retired to chew the cud&#xD;
of injured meditation. His grievances had&#xD;
begun early in the evening-begun with&#xD;
some trifling cause of offence even before&#xD;
they left home-and every successive hour&#xD;
had swollen them into greater magnitude.&#xD;
For some time, he held lila ground steadily&#xD;
at the back of Valerie's chair; but she had&#xD;
neverbeen in brighter spirits, and so many&#xD;
thronged arimnd her, that he found even a&#xD;
whisper in her ear the next thing to impossi..&#xD;
'ble. Almost any other manwould have had&#xD;
sense enough to perceive that, for once, she&#xD;
preferred word-play with a dozen to senti-&#xD;
ment with one,; and, perceiving this, have&#xD;
been reasonably content to bide his time.&#xD;
But Julian was never reasonable, nor ever&#xD;
content to see attention, that should have&#xD;
been given ti~ him, monopolized 'by one&#xD;
othei~ or twenty others. His offended jeal-&#xD;
ousy waged apace with every fresh offering&#xD;
of incense, and every gracious smile which&#xD;
rewarded each, until at last.the cup of his&#xD;
indignation overflowed, and, heedless of his&#xD;
mother's remonstrant glances, he pushed&#xD;
back his chair like 'an angry school-boy,&#xD;
and retired into a cornarto sulk. There he&#xD;
sat, dark' and lowering, while ~Arle took&#xD;
possession ot~ the vacant seat, and listened&#xD;
eagerly while' Yalerie told him how she had&#xD;
.once~nursed himthrough a fever in one of the&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
hospitals of Shreveport. When she finished,&#xD;
the young man looked up at her with a&#xD;
grateful light shining' in his frank eyes.&#xD;
"So that is why your face has always&#xD;
seemed so strangely familiar to me," he&#xD;
said-" more like some fragment of a dream&#xD;
than an~ thing else? I remember it all&#xD;
now! I remember that, when I got well,&#xD;
and thanked Sister Theresa for my life, she&#xD;
told me that it was not to her I owed it,&#xD;
but to some lady who had nursed me night&#xD;
and day until I was out of danger.' I little&#xD;
thought I should ever find that lady-in the&#xD;
toast of every Louisiana soldier."&#xD;
- "Yes,'? said Valerie, with a blush and a&#xD;
smile. "'The hospitals were so crowded,&#xD;
that the sisters could not do all the nursing,&#xD;
and several of us volunteered our aid. Yours&#xD;
was the worst case in my ward-I shall never&#xD;
forget how you raved 1-and so, of course,&#xD;
I knew you again as soon as I saw you. I&#xD;
was only very sorry that I had to leave&#xD;
town before you were entirely recovered-&#xD;
but papa was transferred to another com-&#xD;
mand, and the doctor assured me you were&#xD;
out of danger."&#xD;
"I am glad he was right," said the young&#xD;
man earnestly. "I am glad that I am alive&#xD;
to thank you for your kindness, and am still&#xD;
more glad to hope that I may some day find&#xD;
means of repaying it-~-at least in part.&#xD;
Will you remember that iyou have one&#xD;
sworn defender and champion, if ever you&#xD;
should need either defender or champion?"'&#xD;
"Yes; I will remember," she said.&#xD;
~' But pray don't talk of thanks and repay-&#xD;
ment, or else you will force me to tell you&#xD;
that what I did for you I would have done&#xD;
for any other soldier-and did do for many&#xD;
others."&#xD;
"And do you think tjiat lessens the ob-&#xD;
ligation?" he asked. "I should rather&#xD;
think that it increased it. In one sense, at&#xD;
least, we are more grateful to strangers&#xD;
than to friends for care or aid. I won't&#xD;
trouble you with thanks if you do not like&#xD;
them, however. I shall only hold Fortune&#xD;
my debtor until she gives me one good&#xD;
chance to render you service."&#xD;
Valerie smiled. She liked the gallant&#xD;
young Marylander who had given up so&#xD;
much, and suffered so much, for the cause&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
A TEST OF POWER.&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
she loved; and for whom her heart had&#xD;
bled when he lay tossing in burning delirium&#xD;
thousands of miles from his home; but&#xD;
these words had a very unreal sound to her&#xD;
ear-as indeed such words will have in the&#xD;
midst of surroundings like hers. It was&#xD;
hardly likely that it would ever be in the&#xD;
power of this stranger to do her service;&#xD;
but still she thanked him as she well knew&#xD;
how to thank, adding half sadly: "We only&#xD;
did our duty.-we women-but it was a'&#xD;
duty that was its own best reward. I am&#xD;
sure there is not one of us who, if we could,&#xD;
would take back the sacrifices, or forget&#xD;
the privations, of those years of glory and&#xD;
suffering. I don't mean to talk hackneyed&#xD;
sentiment; hut there is nothing more true&#xD;
than that life has never given us, never can&#xD;
give us, a greater pleasure than the pleasure&#xD;
of serving the men who were fighijing for us.&#xD;
But this is serious talk for an opera, is it&#xD;
no3 I-and see! here is the chapekscene, to&#xD;
be in keeping."&#xD;
She turned her face toward the stage, and&#xD;
her companion had discretion enough to be&#xD;
silent, while the mild, sad refrain wailed&#xD;
from the orchestra like the cry of a lost&#xD;
spirit, as the long procession swept slowly&#xD;
into the church, leaving Marguerite prone&#xD;
among the desolate tombs. It must be a&#xD;
soul inseparable wedded to levity, a heart&#xD;
wholly given over to frivolity, which this&#xD;
weird, haunting dirge does not move to its&#xD;
utmost depths-does not stir and shake in&#xD;
every chord, by the hopeless desolation too&#xD;
deep even for the agony which 'breathes in&#xD;
its unutterable mournfulness. Just now, it&#xD;
touched Valerie like the voice of her own&#xD;
bereavement. Arle's words - indeed, his&#xD;
very presence-had brought back, slit so&#xD;
vividly, the bitter pain, the sweeping deso-&#xD;
lation; which is all that the name of ~' coun-&#xD;
try" can give to any of her race; and, as&#xD;
she leaned back behind the curtains, shel-&#xD;
tered by their shade,~and the gloom hanging&#xD;
over all things, burning tearsrose into her&#xD;
eyes, and there seemed an answering pang&#xD;
of her heart for every wail of the dying&#xD;
melody. We talk of the fitness of things;&#xD;
but perhaps there is nothing so striking in&#xD;
life as their very unfitness-as the fact that,&#xD;
whenever some great emotion seizes us, as&#xD;
&#xD;
it were, despite our will, it does not choose&#xD;
what we would consider a fitting time or&#xD;
place, but overpowers us amid surroundings&#xD;
that add to its force by their very elements&#xD;
of discordance!&#xD;
After a while, when Valerie looked round,&#xD;
she found, to her surprise, that Darcy had&#xD;
entered the box, and was standing behind&#xD;
Madame Vacquant. She felt a little piqued,&#xD;
for she thought he might have come earlier,&#xD;
or not come at all; but she was about to&#xD;
summon him with a motion of her hand to&#xD;
the chair which .A.rle had by this time va-&#xD;
cated, when Romney suddenly came' back&#xD;
and took possession of it. It would have&#xD;
been well if he had cleared his face before&#xD;
doing so, or atleast modulated his voice to&#xD;
some proper tone; but, on the contrary, he&#xD;
looked as lowering as ever, and spoke ab-&#xD;
ruptly-almost rudely.&#xD;
"I thought that fellow was never going!&#xD;
Can I at last have, a little of your atten~&#xD;
tion?"&#xD;
Valerie's brows contracted. Insolence&#xD;
and familiarity were two things for which&#xD;
she had ever possessed little tolerance and&#xD;
less patien~e.&#xD;
"My attention has been at the service&#xD;
of whoever chose to claim it, all the even-&#xD;
ing," she said, coldly. "If you-"&#xD;
"Yes," he interrupted, bitterly; "if I&#xD;
had felt inclined to take a nod now and&#xD;
then between the words and smiles you gave&#xD;
to others, I might no doubt have had it;&#xD;
but you ought to know, by this time, that I&#xD;
cannot do that-I will not do itt If I can-&#xD;
not obtain what I desire-what you gave&#xD;
me. a day or two ago-I prefer~to take&#xD;
nothing."&#xD;
"I am afraid you will have to content&#xD;
yourself with nothing, then," she said, coolly.&#xD;
"As for what I gave youa day or two ago,&#xD;
that was nothing, that I am aware ef~, be-&#xD;
sides friendliness and courtesy. They are&#xD;
still at your command, unless you choose to&#xD;
throw them away of your own accord. In&#xD;
that ease, I beg that I may not be held ac-&#xD;
countable."&#xD;
Perhaps General Aylmer was~ right-&#xD;
perhapa sh~ was already growing tired of&#xD;
her pretty toy. At least, she 'would' not&#xD;
have spoken thus a week ago, and he felt&#xD;
&#xD;

00                       VALERIE AYLMER.                                                           OVERTURES OF PEACE.                     01&#xD;
&#xD;
it. lie grew very pale, and bit his lip al-&#xD;
most savagely, as he answered:&#xD;
"Of course. It is only I who can be&#xD;
accountable for any thing-not you. It is&#xD;
a fine farce that we have been playing, but&#xD;
if it turns into a tragedy, who is to blame?&#xD;
Tones and smiles are impalpable things, and,&#xD;
hoWever well they do their work, cannot be&#xD;
brought forward as witnesses. Only-you&#xD;
might keep that tone for those who have&#xD;
never known them."&#xD;
Before he finished, he saw that he was&#xD;
losing all he would have risked so much to&#xD;
gain; but the spirit which urged him on&#xD;
made him reckless of consequences, until the&#xD;
last words were spoken. Then he would&#xD;
have given any thjng to have recalled them;&#xD;
but it was too late. Whoever doubted&#xD;
whether Miss Aylmer could be haughty,'&#xD;
should have seen her as she answered:&#xD;
"That is quite enough, I think. You&#xD;
surely cannot be yourself, or you would&#xD;
kn~v that such a tone as this in the last&#xD;
that I can tolerate from any one. You must&#xD;
excuse me if I dispense with your attend-&#xD;
ance for the remainder of the evening; and&#xD;
you may take this comfort with you: the&#xD;
tones an~l smiles of which you speak shall&#xD;
trouble you no more.~~&#xD;
He was about to answer, but she turned&#xD;
from him, and so-the angry devil upper-&#xD;
most for the time-he rose and left the box.&#xD;
Then, after a moment, Valerie leaned for-&#xD;
ward and touched Maurice Darcy, who bad&#xD;
striven twt to hear the brief ttite~d~teAte just&#xD;
concluded. When he 'turned, she pointed&#xD;
to the vacant chair.&#xD;
"Sit dawn, please,~~ she said "I have&#xD;
something to say to you; and I confess I&#xD;
like to talk on a level. Now-that is bet-&#xD;
ter. To begin, then, did I hear you tell Ma-&#xD;
da~ne Vacquant that you were not going to&#xD;
Mrs. More's to-night?"&#xD;
"Yes," he answered; "I told her that it&#xD;
was probable I should not be4there. I am&#xD;
not fond of crush balls, and I pron~ised&#xD;
Thornton to join a supper-party at Guy's."&#xD;
"Would Mr. Thornton care very much&#xD;
If you broke your promise?"&#xD;
probablyy not; but why do you ask?"&#xD;
"For a singular reason, I suppose you&#xD;
will think," she said, with a laugh. "I have&#xD;
&#xD;
taken a fancy to recall you to a sense of&#xD;
duty. Mrs. More, and especially Miss Nel-&#xD;
lie, will think very hardly of your treating&#xD;
them in this way. You ought to go to the&#xD;
bali-you must go 1"&#xD;
"You speak like a born empress," he&#xD;
said, smiling. "But I cannot admit the&#xD;
force of your reasoning. Mrs. More ana&#xD;
Miss Nellie will not miss one face from their&#xD;
five hundred friends."&#xD;
"Suppose I say that I will miss it, then?&#xD;
Will you refuse to please me, too?"&#xD;
If she meant to test her power, or dis-&#xD;
cover whether she possessed any, she must&#xD;
have been greatly disappointed at the tene&#xD;
in which Darcy answered:&#xD;
"I regret to be obliged to do so. But&#xD;
an engagement, in my eyes, is always bind-&#xD;
ing; and then I am sure you can be only&#xD;
jesting when you affect any interest in&#xD;
whether I go or stay."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," she retorted. "I&#xD;
never trouble myself to affect interest in&#xD;
any thing. Just now, I have a genuine&#xD;
fancy to change your resolution. Can I not&#xD;
tempt you by the first waltz?"&#xD;
"If I could be tempted, I would not&#xD;
need such an inducement."&#xD;
She looked at him steadily, and saw that&#xD;
he meant what he said; sawalso, that this&#xD;
was evidently dift~ent material from that&#xD;
which she was accustomed to bend to her&#xD;
will; and so, with a rather equivocal smile,&#xD;
gave up the point.&#xD;
"I have always heard that Irishmen&#xD;
were proverbial for gallantry; and I confess&#xD;
I am not used to finding engagements stand&#xD;
in ~n~j way," she sald. "You have disa-&#xD;
bused me of two erroneous impressions,&#xD;
Captain Darcy, so I suppose I ought to&#xD;
thank you. Is the house absolutely empty-&#xD;
ing? Well, at least, I hope you will relieve&#xD;
Mr. Wilmer of double duty by seeing me to&#xD;
the carriage?"&#xD;
What Darcy's reply was, it is not hard&#xD;
to conjecture; but, for all that, La lelle des&#xD;
1$ellea went to the ball alone, and he joined&#xD;
the supper at Guy's.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
ovERTuRES or PEAcE.&#xD;
IT was a very pale face, and very heavy,&#xD;
bloodshot eyes, that Romney brought down&#xD;
to~ the breakfast-room the next morning,&#xD;
when he sauntered in so late that every one&#xD;
had long since departed, and only his&#xD;
mother was left to bear him company. Per-&#xD;
haps he had not expected or desired to see&#xD;
her, for he frowned at meeting her glance,&#xD;
and flung himself; without speaking, into a&#xD;
chair. He did not even thank her for the&#xD;
cup of coffee which she extended toward&#xD;
him, but took it silently, with a somewhat&#xD;
tremulous hand, and then pointed to the&#xD;
sideboard. The servant in attendance evi-&#xD;
dently understood what was meant, for he&#xD;
brought forward a small decanter of French&#xD;
brandy, from which Julian poured a liberal&#xD;
"sharpener~~ into his cup. Then, meeting&#xD;
his mother's eye, he muttered half apologet-&#xD;
ically:&#xD;
"It is the best thing in the world to&#xD;
steady one's nerves."&#xD;
Madame Yacquant made a motion dis-&#xD;
missing the servant before she answered,&#xD;
with cold reproach:&#xD;
"Nerves 'don't need steadying that have&#xD;
not been racked overnight by dissipation."&#xD;
"Not by drink, at least," he retorted,&#xD;
angrily. "I drank not a drop more than&#xD;
just enough to keep me up."&#xD;
"Up to what?"&#xD;
He raised his eyes half-defiantly, an(I&#xD;
perhaps something in the hardness of her&#xD;
tone may have provoked the reckless dis-&#xD;
dain of his.&#xD;
"Up to play, if you must know."&#xD;
With all her self-control, Madame Vac-&#xD;
quant could not prevent a slight change of&#xD;
color, nor a slight gasp of the breath, as she&#xD;
said, bitterly:&#xD;
"And this is your promise?"&#xD;
"My promise was a very indefinite one,"&#xD;
he answered, coolly. "I hope you did not&#xD;
understand it as a total abstinence pledge."&#xD;
"No; I only understood this-that, if&#xD;
you played in 'future, it must be with the&#xD;
certainty of having to pay your own debts."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You mean that you will advance noth-&#xD;
ingmore?"&#xD;
"I mean that, emphatically."&#xD;
He drained his cup, and pushed it back&#xD;
violently. "Then I' might as well buy a&#xD;
dose of prussie acid," he said, bitterly.&#xD;
"One thing is certain, 1 will not endure the&#xD;
disgrace of shirking debts of honor, and I&#xD;
have not the means to pay one-third of the&#xD;
sum I lost last night."&#xD;
"How much was it?"&#xD;
He named the amount--a large one in-&#xD;
deed-but his mother did not start. She&#xD;
only said, icily, "You should have thought&#xD;
of your ability for payment before staking&#xD;
so much."&#xD;
He looked at her steadily, but there was&#xD;
no change at all in her face, and at length&#xD;
he muttered, sullenly: "I see I should have&#xD;
thought of it. But now there is nothing&#xD;
left save to pay what I have lost. If you&#xD;
won't help me-of course you can if you&#xD;
'choose-I shall only have to borrow the&#xD;
money on usury, and then-leave here! If&#xD;
I once do that, Baltimore is not likely to see&#xD;
me again soon.~~&#xD;
"We can dispense with threats," she&#xD;
said, coolly. "You might know, by this&#xD;
time, that they have very little effect on me.&#xD;
Perhaps I am not heroically inclined, but I&#xD;
am not at all afraid of your committing sui-&#xD;
cide, or going away to starve. We had bet-&#xD;
ter come back to the point, and let me cor-&#xD;
rect one statement in your last speech. You&#xD;
say there is no doubt of my being able to&#xD;
help you if I choose: you are mistaken. l~&#xD;
don't choosebut if I did, I should find it&#xD;
hard to do so. You exhausted my private&#xD;
resources when you made your last de-&#xD;
mand. If I helped you again,.I would have&#xD;
to call on M. Vacquant."&#xD;
He looked up eagerly; cold as her tone&#xD;
was, he seemed to find so~e assurance of&#xD;
hope in it. "What' is more easy than&#xD;
that?" he inquired.&#xD;
"It is like a man's selfishness to ask,"&#xD;
his mother answered, with something be-&#xD;
tween scorn and indignation in her voice.&#xD;
"Very easy and verynatura! to yonI grant,&#xD;
that I shoi~ld lie and dissimulate, for the&#xD;
sake of your vices-but not so easy or so&#xD;
natural to me! Does it never strike you&#xD;

that, in applying to M. Vacquant, Ihave to&#xD;
assign some pretext for the demand ~"&#xD;
"I should think you would only need to&#xD;
choose among a dozen pretexts. He must&#xD;
be a strange millionnaire if he grudges his&#xD;
wife a few thousands for pin-money."&#xD;
"He does not grudge it-he is liberal to&#xD;
a fault. But he is not easily blinded. He&#xD;
would not hesitate a moment to give me&#xD;
any reasonable amount for which I asked;&#xD;
but he would suspect at once for what pur-&#xD;
pose I wanted it."&#xD;
"Well-let him!"&#xD;
"Let him! You say that, when you&#xD;
know that he does not like you now?"&#xD;
"Yes, I know," Romney answered, with&#xD;
a sneer. "But what then? His like or dis-&#xD;
like does not matter to me, so long as he&#xD;
does not order me from his house, or forbid&#xD;
me the use of his cellar. As for any hopes&#xD;
of heirship, I should think you would have&#xD;
seen, long ago, that they were mere moon-&#xD;
shine."&#xD;
"I see that you have only yourself to&#xD;
thank for their failure. Do you think he&#xD;
would have cared to take up this adven-&#xD;
turer, if you had not disappointed him?"&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders. "You flat-&#xD;
ter yourself~ So far from disappointing&#xD;
him, he never even thought of me. As for&#xD;
the adventurer-I suppose you mean Darcy&#xD;
-he seems to.sult him, and I am sure it is&#xD;
all a question of taste. He is not likely to&#xD;
suit anybody else."&#xD;
"I am not sure about that. I begin to&#xD;
think, of late, that he may suit somebody&#xD;
else."&#xD;
Her tone was so significant that Juliau&#xD;
started quickly. "Whom do you mean? "he&#xD;
asked, curtly:"&#xD;
She answered, briefly, "I mean Valerie."&#xD;
"You think that this-this painter is&#xD;
likely-to please her?"&#xD;
"Yers, I'think so."&#xD;
"May-" The curse was none the less&#xD;
bitter because something :of conventional&#xD;
courtesy made the speaker finish-it beneath&#xD;
his breath. Perhaps Ms mother did not.&#xD;
hear him; at all events she only said quiet-&#xD;
ly, ~ftera moment:&#xD;
"The onlyhope is, that he may not care&#xD;
to take advantage of her caprice."&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
"Then there is no hope at all," the oth-&#xD;
er retorted. "Better men would give half&#xD;
their lives for such a chance."&#xD;
"Better men, perhaps, but certainly not&#xD;
wiser' ones," she answered, coldly. "I~o&#xD;
woman is worth half a man's life; and a&#xD;
coquette like Valerie Aylmer is not worth&#xD;
one day of it. Maurice may not see that&#xD;
her nets are thrown in his direction just&#xD;
now, but, if he does, he at least 'has sense&#xD;
enough to decline giving her vanity another&#xD;
triumph."&#xD;
"What do you ~&#xD;
"I 'mean this-" and she repeated to&#xD;
him the scene that had followed his depart-&#xD;
ure the night before. ":N~ow," she said, in&#xD;
conclusion, " you see what was the re-&#xD;
sult of your folly and obstinacy. If Mau-&#xD;
rice had not played into your hand, you&#xD;
would only have thrown up the game to&#xD;
him. When will you learn that moody&#xD;
looks and angry words have lost many a&#xD;
cause, but never yet gained one-especially&#xD;
with a woman? If you were engaged to&#xD;
Valerie a dozen times over, you could not&#xD;
act with impunity, as you acted last night.&#xD;
And in a man whose chances hang on a&#xD;
thread, it was simple madness. I shall not&#xD;
be surprised if you have ruined yourself ir-&#xD;
reparably."&#xD;
She paused, but he sat sullenly silent-&#xD;
making no effort toward answer or self-jus-&#xD;
tification; and after a moment she re-&#xD;
sumed:&#xD;
"You surely forget how much hangs on&#xD;
this, or you would never have been betrayed&#xD;
i~nto such folly. You surely forget that~ if&#xD;
you do not succeed here, your last chance&#xD;
of the fortune is gone. It is a matter of&#xD;
life and death with you to make a claim on&#xD;
M. Vacquant by marrying his granddaugh-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
He flung himself back in his chair with&#xD;
a sort of fierce impatience.&#xD;
"It- is likely to be death, then."&#xD;
"Yes," she said, contemptuously, "if&#xD;
you choose to surrender the field-and I&#xD;
never saw a fairer one-without a blow."&#xD;
"You say that, because you don't know&#xD;
how 'little she means, or has meant'any&#xD;
thing beyond this foolery of flirtation."&#xD;
"There you are mistaken. I know ex-&#xD;

aetly what she means-and I also know&#xD;
what, if you were wise, you would mean.&#xD;
She' means amusement-you would mean&#xD;
earnest. If you, only knew how to play&#xD;
your cards even tolerably, I see the end so&#xD;
clear."&#xD;
He looked up eagerly. "Show it to me&#xD;
then! Show me any certainty of gaining&#xD;
her, and you will never need to find fault&#xD;
with my vacillation again?"&#xD;
"The ~first thing is to go and make your&#xD;
peace for last night's conduct. Bring mat-&#xD;
ters back to the footing of a day or two ago,&#xD;
and that will be one step gained. But -you&#xD;
must keep your temper under control in&#xD;
future. You will find her in the sitting-&#xD;
room."&#xD;
The last words were spoken in some-&#xD;
what of a tone of surprise, for Julian did not&#xD;
stir. On the contrary, he sat still-a pic-&#xD;
ture of resentful obstinacy.&#xD;
"That'is all very fine, but, before I play&#xD;
puppet in the dark, I must have some assur-&#xD;
ance about that money. It must be forth-&#xD;
coming-by some means or other. Do you&#xD;
mean to get it for me, or shall I go to the&#xD;
usurers ?"&#xD;
"If I do get it for you,. you must remem-&#xD;
ber that it is for the last time."&#xD;
"Yes-of course."&#xD;
"And that I will receive no more 'in-&#xD;
definite' promises in exchange."&#xD;
"I will give my bond not to touch cards&#xD;
or dice again until I can stake some of my&#xD;
affectionate step-father's thousands on them&#xD;
"We will te1I~ of oonditione when the&#xD;
money is ready," she said, rising. "N'ow&#xD;
will you 'go to Valerie, or will you wait un-&#xD;
til some visitor comes in, and the opportu-&#xD;
nity is lost?"&#xD;
He answered by shrugging his shoulders&#xD;
and leaving the room.&#xD;
A few moments later, Vakrie, who' wa~&#xD;
seated at the piano, playing strains and&#xD;
snatches from "Faust," heard the door be-&#xD;
hind her softly open, and looking up into a&#xD;
large mirror against the wall, saw Romney's&#xD;
face as he entered the room. It was a good&#xD;
thing that he hadpaused outside to banish all&#xD;
trace of its late expression from it, and sum-&#xD;
mon up a languor which rather became the&#xD;
&#xD;
OF PEACE.                         93&#xD;
pallid complexion and purple-ringed eyes,&#xD;
for he had not counted on such a speedy ob-&#xD;
servation as this, and Valerie, in her turn,&#xD;
was less inclined to suspect the genuineness&#xD;
of what she saw. His appearance, indeed,&#xD;
struck her so forcibly, that involuntarily her&#xD;
hands fell from the keys, and she turned&#xD;
round as he advanced.&#xD;
"You look shockingly!" she said, be-&#xD;
fore he could speak. "What is the mat-&#xD;
ter?".&#xD;
Romney was not at all lacking in natu-&#xD;
ral readiness, or slow to take any advantage&#xD;
offered him. He saw his opportunity in a&#xD;
moment, and followed it up with commend-&#xD;
able quickness. "I may well look shock-&#xD;
ingly," he said, "if repentance can write it-&#xD;
self on the face. I have endured more than&#xD;
I can say since last night, and have had&#xD;
only one thought-how I can ask you to&#xD;
pardon me."&#xD;
"That is not hard, if you can say that&#xD;
you did not mean-"&#xD;
Ilerehe inteiruptedher quickly: "Mean!&#xD;
Ah, how can you think that I meant any&#xD;
thing excepting that I was half beside my-&#xD;
self? I scarcely know what I said; but I&#xD;
am sure it must have been very dreadful, or&#xD;
you would not have punished it so severely.&#xD;
I would not sentence my worst enemy to&#xD;
such a night and such a morning as you have&#xD;
given me."&#xD;
"As for the morning, perhaps that has&#xD;
been your own fault," she said, smiling.&#xD;
"You could certainly have shortened it by&#xD;
several hours, if you had chosen. But the&#xD;
night-well, we won't question whose fault&#xD;
that Was. Mine, perhaps, in a measure-&#xD;
for I have remembered since tha~t I was&#xD;
neither so patient nor so considerate as I&#xD;
might have been. If you are penitent-and&#xD;
I think you look so-we wrn cry quits, and&#xD;
be friends again."&#xD;
Was not this better than he had a right&#xD;
to expect? Romney evidently~thought so, for&#xD;
his thanks were poured out warm and fast,&#xD;
together with his justifications. It was in&#xD;
the midst of these last that Valerie stopped&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"One ~moment, if you please; Your&#xD;
claim to be angry last~night was founded on&#xD;
something about which I don't care to ar-&#xD;

gue; but, in resuming amicable relations,&#xD;
we must understand one another. I have&#xD;
said that we are friends. You know what&#xD;
that means-and you also know that friends&#xD;
are not jealous of each other."&#xD;
"No," he answered, with a good deal&#xD;
of creditable self-control; "and, perhaps,&#xD;
that is one reason why I never had much&#xD;
fancy for friendship. But it seems I am to&#xD;
learn it. Do you know how bard a task&#xD;
you set me?-or do you care?"&#xD;
"I don't know why it should be a hard&#xD;
task," she retorted. "If you think so, how-&#xD;
ever, I bad better declare us strangers-or, if&#xD;
you like it better, enemies.&#xD;
"You are jesting, while I am in earnest,"&#xD;
he said, gravely. "I am not your friend-&#xD;
in the sense you mean-or ever likely to be.&#xD;
But I would do any thing in the world to&#xD;
please you; and I can play at this, if you&#xD;
desire it. Only don't be angry if I some-&#xD;
times forget my r6le, and speak as I&#xD;
feeL"&#xD;
"I shall be angry, however-especially&#xD;
if you speak as you did last night."&#xD;
"Don't mention last night. it is like a&#xD;
nightmare to me. I was half mad when I&#xD;
went away from you, and cari you imagine&#xD;
what Idid?"&#xD;
Perhaps not quite truthfully, she shook&#xD;
her head. -&#xD;
"I went straight to the hazard-table,"&#xD;
he said, "to try and forget every thing in&#xD;
the excitement of play. But I could not&#xD;
succeed. I was thinking all the time of you,&#xD;
and wondering what you were doing. I&#xD;
lost one game, I remember, trying to ima-&#xD;
gine who was enjoying my waltz."&#xD;
Valerie blushed deeply. She remem-&#xD;
bered how vainly she had offered that waltz&#xD;
to Maurice Darcy.&#xD;
"I will tell you who enjoyed it," she&#xD;
said, "and then you will see that your anx-&#xD;
iety was lost as well as your game. It fell&#xD;
to George More, quite the stupidest man in&#xD;
Baltimore. Now I hope you are as much&#xD;
ashamed of yourself as you ought to be.&#xD;
By-the-by, do you know that I feel nearly&#xD;
as badly as you look? Dissipation don't&#xD;
seem to agree with us. I wonderif a can-&#xD;
ter would~-do you think the day is too cold?&#xD;
No? I &amp;amp;ni se glad to hear it. Then pray&#xD;
&#xD;
.AYLMER.&#xD;
order the horses, while I go and put on my&#xD;
habit."&#xD;
He obeyed-only too well pleased to do&#xD;
so-whilelMladtune Yacquant's brew smooth-&#xD;
ed, as, sitting alone in her own room, she&#xD;
heard Valerie's clear voice lilting the&#xD;
"Flower-Song" on her way np-stairs, and&#xD;
knew thereby that the overtures of peace&#xD;
had been successful. When she heard the&#xD;
same light step descending, however, she&#xD;
opened her door to give a warning.&#xD;
"Are you going to ride, Valerie? Pray&#xD;
don't over-exert yourself; so that you will&#xD;
be tired and dull to-night. You know we&#xD;
are martyrs to a regular dinner-party, and&#xD;
I look to you for assistance in making it&#xD;
agreeable."&#xD;
"As ir you needed any assistance!"&#xD;
Valerie laughed; "or as if your dinner-par-&#xD;
ties were not the only endurable ones I ever&#xD;
knew. Don't be afraid of my over-exerting&#xD;
myself, however. Nothing, will do me do&#xD;
much good as a canter-indeed it is myonly&#xD;
hope of being able to enjoy Mr. Lawton's&#xD;
good things at all."&#xD;
She nodded gayly, and glided past. The&#xD;
next moment ~he was mounted, and canter-&#xD;
ing over the paving-stones of Charles Street&#xD;
Avenue, much to the astonishment of the&#xD;
lookers-on, who, in their Northern igno-&#xD;
rance, associated equestrianism only with soft&#xD;
air and bright skies, and could not conceive&#xD;
that she inhaled with positive zest the damp&#xD;
salt breeze, which brought her hair out of&#xD;
curl, put a glorious color into her cheek, as&#xD;
she shook the reins on her horse's neck, and&#xD;
looked at Julian with a smile.&#xD;
"Is not this enough to make us forget all&#xD;
the disagreeable of last night?" she asked.&#xD;
And truly few men would have failed to&#xD;
give the cordial~affirmative which was his&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
Descending the staircase that evening&#xD;
about twenty minutes before dinner,,Valerie&#xD;
suddenly met Darcy. It was the, first time&#xD;
they had seeti each other since the night be-&#xD;
fore; and the remembrance of that fact&#xD;
made the bow with which she was passing&#xD;
him rather cold and stately; when, to her&#xD;
surprise, he paused-thus barring her way,&#xD;
and forciugher to do likewise.&#xD;

&#xD;
".l~xcuse me," he said, with a glance at&#xD;
her dress. "I see you are all ready for the&#xD;
drawing-room, but perhaps you won't mind&#xD;
being detained a moment to hear some news&#xD;
which may interest you. It is no longer a&#xD;
matter of doubt about Miss Rivi~re's appear-&#xD;
ance in public. She makes her de'1'ut in&#xD;
three weeks."&#xD;
"Her debutt" Tepeated Valerie, startled&#xD;
out of her reserve, by this intelligence, which&#xD;
did interest her very much. "Why, this is&#xD;
i~ews indeed! I had very little idea that&#xD;
her courage would ever be equal to the de-&#xD;
cisive step. You are sure of it?"&#xD;
"Perfectly sure," he answered. "She&#xD;
was kind enough to ask my advice on the&#xD;
subject, and I gave it unhesitatingly in favor&#xD;
of an immediate plunge. Craning over a&#xD;
venture is the best thing in the world for&#xD;
sapping away the courage drop by drop-&#xD;
but not for any thing else that I know of."&#xD;
"But-I don't understand. Is she to&#xD;
appear in opera?"&#xD;
"No. Her parents would never consent&#xD;
to that, I am sure. She is to appear,. but I&#xD;
forget that I was charged not to anticipate&#xD;
her. She wants the pleasure of giving you&#xD;
the particulars herself."&#xD;
"But you can tell me-"&#xD;
"Nothing whatever, I am sorry to say,"&#xD;
he interrupted, with a smile and a glance at&#xD;
his watch. "I am bound over to secrecy;&#xD;
and I see that I have barely fifteen minutes&#xD;
in which to make my toilet. I am sure you&#xD;
are glad I cannot detain you longer. Only&#xD;
one word-may I trust to your influence in&#xD;
inducing her to sing for Thornton to-&#xD;
night?"&#xD;
"I will try, but-is that necessary?"&#xD;
"It is very necessary, since he repre-&#xD;
sents all the good musical element of the&#xD;
city."&#xD;
"But he is very incredulous of Alix's&#xD;
powers."&#xD;
"So much the more triumph in convert-&#xD;
ing him, as I mean to do-if you promise&#xD;
your assistance."&#xD;
"Of course, it is entirely at your ser-&#xD;
vice."&#xD;
"Then I am sure of success," he said,&#xD;
with a laugh; and the next moment they&#xD;
parted.&#xD;
&#xD;
OF. PEACE.                        95&#xD;
When Valerie entered the drawing-room,&#xD;
she found it well filled-almost the due pro-&#xD;
portion of guests having arrived, and that&#xD;
appalling solemnity which precedes the an-&#xD;
nouncement of dinner being already heavy&#xD;
in the air. The conversational murmur&#xD;
which filled the saloon had none of that regu-&#xD;
lar, unbroken sweep that~ characterizes it&#xD;
when the full tide of evening has set in, but&#xD;
was low and fitful; broken by intervals of al-&#xD;
most entire silence, that were only bridged&#xD;
over by Madame Vacquant's tones, as she&#xD;
glided from guest to guest, uttering to each&#xD;
the same form of compliment or inquiry,&#xD;
slightly varied to suit the different individ-&#xD;
ual. There were groups of middle-aged&#xD;
gentlemen who chiefly affected the hearth-&#xD;
rug, and talked a little polities amouig them-&#xD;
selves, as they regarded the light ivory-and-&#xD;
gold car of Aurora over the mantel, on&#xD;
whose side the tiny hands were moving fast&#xD;
to the magical stroke of eight. There were&#xD;
elderly ladies, magnificent in heavy velvets&#xD;
and stately mores, enthroned upon sofas&#xD;
and in the depths of dormeuses, exchanging&#xD;
spasmodic confidences about schools and&#xD;
committee-work. There were young ladies&#xD;
scattered like gay birds of tropic plumage&#xD;
in the various nooks and corners of the&#xD;
room, making many picture-like effects&#xD;
with their gleaming dresses and golden hair.&#xD;
There was a brace of English officers, w~io&#xD;
surveyed the company superciliously from&#xD;
over the collars of moming-co~ts, and&#xD;
talked principally to one another. There&#xD;
was enough of the literary and artistic ele-&#xD;
ment to relieve the insipidity of a purely&#xD;
fashionable T~union-and there was the&#xD;
usual amount of jeune gens of whum it is&#xD;
the highest compliment to say that they&#xD;
were, as a whole, sufficiently unexceptiona-&#xD;
ble to escape notice. Finally, there was Alix&#xD;
Rivi~re who,, nestling under the wing of a&#xD;
severe-looking chaperon-her mother rare-&#xD;
ly attended any evening ei~tertainment-&#xD;
gave an exclamation of pleasure when she&#xD;
saw Miss Aylmer, and toward whom the&#xD;
latter at once made her way.&#xD;
Before 'they had time for more than a&#xD;
cordial greeting, however, dinner was an-&#xD;
nounced, arid all the stir and rustle of exit&#xD;
began. "We will bide our time, ~etite,'~&#xD;

Valerie whispered; as she found herself&#xD;
claimed by that same Mr. Lawton, for the&#xD;
appreciation of whose good things she had&#xD;
declared a canter necessary; then, while she&#xD;
still hesitated 'to see who would be sent by&#xD;
Madame Vacquant to the service of Alix,&#xD;
Darcy made his opportune appearance, and&#xD;
they wheeled into line.&#xD;
To more than one person the long cere-&#xD;
mony which followed proved infinitely&#xD;
wearying, certainly to Julian, who had been&#xD;
consigned to the tender mercies of avery live-&#xD;
ly young lady who was "devoted" to every&#xD;
thing, from religion to skating, and possessed&#xD;
an opinion ready-made and very glib of utter-&#xD;
ance on every subject under heaven; cer-&#xD;
tainly to Valerie, even despite Mr. Lawton's&#xD;
genuine wit and fresh conversational power;&#xD;
certainly to Mr. Thornton, who had fallen&#xD;
into the hands of a femalePhilistine who con-&#xD;
ceived that she was doing exactly the right&#xD;
thing in talking musical "shop" (of a very&#xD;
questionable quality) in unlimited quantity;&#xD;
perhaps even to Darcy and Alix, although&#xD;
they seemed ~very well entertained by one&#xD;
another; but the end came at last-as, if we&#xD;
are only patient, the end of every thing must&#xD;
-and Madame Vacquant gave the signal for&#xD;
the departure of the ladies. Once more there&#xD;
was the soft rustle of silk and velvet, as&#xD;
they filed ont in glittering array, leaving&#xD;
the gentlemen to close, with a sigh of re-&#xD;
lief, round the mahogany, and do that jus-&#xD;
tice to good' olives and better wine which&#xD;
feminine presence had before restrained.&#xD;
Nobody was more glad of this release&#xD;
than Valerie. Not' that she was fond of,&#xD;
the' unlimited gossip which always ensued,&#xD;
of hearing why Sarah Randolph persisted&#xD;
in marrying that dissipated young Carroll;&#xD;
of ho~ Mr. Wilson, who compromised with&#xD;
his editors for fifty cents in the dollar, last&#xD;
winter, could afford to give such entertain-&#xD;
ments this seasons of whether Mrs. Kerr's&#xD;
poir~t d'Aleng~rn cost the price sh6 profess-&#xD;
es to hate' given for it in ?aris and if it is&#xD;
likely "the bishop" will allow Rev. Mr.&#xD;
Ray, of the straitest sect of the ritualists, to&#xD;
burn candles on his communion-table-but&#xD;
simply because she was anxious to learn&#xD;
from 'Alir Rivi~re's own lips the particu~&#xD;
lava of her intended d~ut. Avoiding, there-&#xD;
&#xD;
fore, the group which surrounded Madame&#xD;
Yacquant, audthe still less interesting knot&#xD;
at the piano-where some enterprising mu-&#xD;
sician with a very brilliant left hand began&#xD;
to sacrifice over 'again that oft-murdered&#xD;
"Home" of Thalberg's-she beckoned to&#xD;
Alix, and led the way to the conservatory.&#xD;
They found it still uninvaded, serenely&#xD;
quiet, and beautiful as ever. The soft plash&#xD;
of the fountain was the only audible sound,&#xD;
the moonlight lustre fell a~ mellowly down&#xD;
through the giant ferns' as when Valerie had&#xD;
first stood there, and the iAch tropical fra-&#xD;
grance was heavy on the air. It was with a&#xD;
very deep sigh of relief that Alix sank into&#xD;
one of the seats that bordered the marble&#xD;
basin, where the gold-fishes darted and&#xD;
played, and the water rose and sank with&#xD;
such melodious cadence.&#xD;
"How charming it is! "she said, "and&#xD;
so beautiful I I don't wonder that people&#xD;
say that this conservatory has seen more&#xD;
flirtations and beard more declarations than&#xD;
any other in Baltimore I I am sure that, if&#xD;
I were one of your captivOs, I could not re-&#xD;
frain from love-making, Valerie-especially&#xD;
in this bewitching light."&#xD;
"Youwill allow me to be glad, then, that&#xD;
you are not," Valerie answered. "There are&#xD;
a great many things more agreeable than&#xD;
love-making--especially when the interest is&#xD;
all on one side. And just at present I am&#xD;
only interested in an item of news which&#xD;
Captain Darcy gave me before dinner; Cau&#xD;
you possibly imagine what it was?"&#xD;
Alix looked up with a world of innocence&#xD;
in her eyes.'&#xD;
"How should I, dear? I am the last&#xD;
person in the world to be clever at di-&#xD;
vining."&#xD;
"Keep your powers of acting for the&#xD;
stage, little hypocrite," Miss Aylmer an-&#xD;
swered, giving a twitch to the curl nearest&#xD;
her," and tell'me at once why I am left to&#xD;
hear from a third person, that you are about&#xD;
to make your d6but."&#xD;
"I did not know it myself until this&#xD;
morning," Alix' replied, with a mournful&#xD;
sigh. "The maestro came in with the de-&#xD;
cision, papa and mamma ratified it, and&#xD;
when, as a forlorn hope, I appealed to Cap-&#xD;
tain Darcy, he too went against me. If&#xD;
&#xD;
B&#xD;
&#xD;
r had thought you would have helped me to&#xD;
form an opposition, I would have called you&#xD;
into the council, but I knew better."&#xD;
"Yes, I should have agreed with the&#xD;
rest. If the step is to be taken, it should be&#xD;
made at once. And tell mesome of the par-&#xD;
ticulars, for your confidant was too obsti-&#xD;
nate or too scrupulous to do so. Where&#xD;
are you goingto sing? and how? and what?&#xD;
Is it at an amateur concert that you will ap-&#xD;
pear?"&#xD;
"No, Mr. Rosenberg says that would do&#xD;
me no good. It is too professional, and-&#xD;
but of course you have heard of the famous&#xD;
singer, Madame Baroni, who landed the&#xD;
other day in New York?"&#xD;
"Of course."&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Rosenberg, without telling&#xD;
me any thing of his intentions, went to New&#xD;
York to see her, and ask her if she would&#xD;
allow me to appear at the concert she is to&#xD;
give here a few weeks hence. He says she&#xD;
was as kind as possible, and assured him&#xD;
that it would give, her sincere pleasure to as-&#xD;
sist at the debut of 'a young aspirant for&#xD;
musical honors '-as 'the newspapers say.&#xD;
Was it not kind?&#xD;
"Very. But then, I think, most artists&#xD;
who have climbed the heightss of their pro-&#xD;
fession are willing to aid those who are&#xD;
taking the first hard steps. Only, mi-&#xD;
gnomne, don't you feel a little afraid of such&#xD;
a wonderful cantatrice as this Baroni must&#xD;
be?"&#xD;
The child-she was scarcely more than&#xD;
that-.--looked up with her soft eyes shimmer-&#xD;
ing like stars out of the brave young face.&#xD;
"I might be," she said, simply, "if it were&#xD;
not for papa and mamma. But, when I think&#xD;
of helping them, I do not feel as if I could&#xD;
be afraid of any thing."&#xD;
"You are a true knight-errant! "Valerie&#xD;
said, stooping to kiss the fair; up-turned&#xD;
brow. "And you are right! The older I&#xD;
grow, the more do I think that self-forget-&#xD;
fulness is the best secret of courage. With&#xD;
it, you will succeed, I think-and, if so, do&#xD;
you mean to go on the lyric stage?"&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"I think not. Papa, I am very sure,&#xD;
would never consent. And, even if he did,&#xD;
mamma's health is too delicate for me to&#xD;

&#xD;
leave her. Besides, I could never succeed&#xD;
there without the prestige of European cul-&#xD;
ture."&#xD;
"What will you do, then?"&#xD;
"Remain here, I expect-for some time&#xD;
at least. Mr. Rosenberg says that a public&#xD;
success will open a good many doors to me.&#xD;
rar exemple, I am already promised a choir&#xD;
position, with a good salary. Then, I shall&#xD;
sing in concerts, you know."&#xD;
She spoke very quietly and simply; but,&#xD;
as Valerie listened, a vision rose before her&#xD;
of the luxurious home, where she had first&#xD;
seen this young soldier of fortune, of the fair&#xD;
inheritance of which she was then sole heir-&#xD;
ess, of the petted life that seemed to stretch&#xD;
before her; and now, in contrast-this!&#xD;
Her voice was hardly steady as she said:&#xD;
"A poor prospect, Alix, for talent like&#xD;
yours! You are sentencing yourself to the&#xD;
mere drudgery of your profession, when you&#xD;
might earn its highest rewards."&#xD;
"I know-but what can I do?"&#xD;
What can I do? A sternly practical&#xD;
question that, which few of us are able to&#xD;
answer for ourselves, far less for others. It&#xD;
was no wonder that Valerie evaded it when&#xD;
she said:&#xD;
"You should go to Europe."&#xD;
"You might as well tell me I should go,&#xD;
like a pen, to the gates of Paradise," Alix&#xD;
answered, sadly. "And now-but some one&#xD;
is coming."&#xD;
The words were scarcely uttered, before&#xD;
Maurice Darcy and Mr. Thornton came from&#xD;
around a tall shrub. After their first greet-&#xD;
ing was over, Darcy turned at once to the&#xD;
matter which seemed to be just then occu-&#xD;
pying all of his attention,&#xD;
"Miss Rivi~re, Mr. Thornton is very&#xD;
anxious to hear you sing; and I have ven-&#xD;
tured to promise that you will gratify him.&#xD;
I am sure you wrn not make me guilty of&#xD;
guaranteeing more than I could perform."&#xD;
"I am sure you deserve fhat I should!"&#xD;
said Alix, with a glance which meant more&#xD;
than the words-for she had changed color'&#xD;
a little at the ominous beginning. "No&#xD;
man of discretion would risk his word on&#xD;
any thing so unreliable as a woman's ca.~-&#xD;
price.-.Don't you think so, Mr. Thorn..&#xD;
ton?"&#xD;

Mr. Thornton answered; "be-&#xD;

woman seldom has a caprice, is the redeem-&#xD;
ing of a friend's word."&#xD;
"And that means-"&#xD;
"It means that Captain Darcy has&#xD;

you will do so."&#xD;
lie spoke cordially and gracefully, for he&#xD;
was not a man to do things by halves, and&#xD;
did not choose to be ungracious to the song-&#xD;
stress, because he really had no desire to&#xD;
hear her ;iind, as there was little of the con-&#xD;
ventional young lady in Alix Rivi~re, she&#xD;
rose at once without further urging.&#xD;
"Of course I will sing, if you desire it,"&#xD;
she said, quietly, though it would be hard&#xD;
to say how much she was secretly trem-&#xD;
bling. Then she accepted the arm which the&#xD;
formidable critic offered, and walked for-&#xD;
ward, leaving only one reproachful glance&#xD;
behind for Darcy.&#xD;
He smiled slightly as lie met it, and, turn-&#xD;
ing to Valerie, said:&#xD;
"You will come also, will you not?"&#xD;
"Of course," she answered, a little&#xD;
piqued that he should have thought the&#xD;
question necessary. "You do not monopo-&#xD;
lize all interest in Alix, pray remember, I&#xD;
think I deserve credit for a moderate&#xD;
amount at least, and-. Ah, Julian, you a~e&#xD;
just in time!"&#xD;
She did not say for what-nor was it&#xD;
necessary that she should, since she held out&#xD;
her hand, and laid it in Romney's readily-&#xD;
tendered arm. If Darcy felt the slight at&#xD;
all, he gave no sign of it, but walked along&#xD;
very quietly by her side, talking of Alix and&#xD;
of Alix's prospects, until they reached the&#xD;
grand piano, to which Mr. Thornton had&#xD;
conducted his charge, and where a group of&#xD;
eager listeners were already gathered. The&#xD;
sweet young face of the girl looked very&#xD;
pale, she had never undergone an ordeal like&#xD;
this before; but Daroy was glad to observe&#xD;
hew" cool and. self-possessed she also seemed.&#xD;
Her gloves were off by the time he gained&#xD;
her side, but it was he who seated her at the&#xD;
plane-whispering a few last words of en-&#xD;
couragement as her hands fell on the keys.&#xD;
"II is a pity she should have to play her&#xD;
own accompaniment," Thornton muttered;&#xD;
&#xD;
but, before he could utter a remonstrance,&#xD;
the tiny, lissome hands had struck their first&#xD;
chords, and the next moment she burst into&#xD;
song.&#xD;
Valerie saw Darcy flash one glance of&#xD;
triumph at his friend, when the first clear&#xD;
notes fell on the ear. Then ho stood satis-&#xD;
fied and quiet, while Alix sang with a&#xD;
power and purity which electrified every&#xD;
musical ear in the room, and proved at once&#xD;
her rich natural gift and her careful musical&#xD;
training. The fresh young voice, llexile and&#xD;
reed-like as a flute, was well worth hearing,&#xD;
as it carolled over the most intricate pas-&#xD;
sages and brilliant ToUla4 68~ without one mo-&#xD;
mentary hesitation or faulty cadence; but&#xD;
Thornton's face was still better worth seeing,&#xD;
as astonishment deepened into admirationn,&#xD;
and admiration into sincere and absorbed&#xD;
enjoyment. He was completely taken by&#xD;
surprise, and when Alix ceased~ and glanced&#xD;
timk~ly toward him, he held out both his&#xD;
hands with a warmth which nobody had&#xD;
ever seen him display before.&#xD;
"Miss Ilivi~re," he said, cordially, "I&#xD;
have always, before this, doubted your pow-&#xD;
ers, and I am heartily glad to be able to tell&#xD;
you, what I shall soon tell every one else,&#xD;
that I was entirely mistaken. If you are&#xD;
not yet one of the greatest singers of your&#xD;
day, it wrn be the fault of yourself-not of&#xD;
l{ature."&#xD;
After that, it was a perfect ovation-a&#xD;
foretaste, perhaps, of many to come-which&#xD;
Madame Vacquant's guests paid to the&#xD;
young songstress thus presented to them.&#xD;
Young and old thronged around the piano,&#xD;
bidding her to play again and yet again-&#xD;
only too eager to follow the path thus&#xD;
marked out for them.&#xD;
Watching the scene from a distance.~-.for&#xD;
after a while she yielded to Julian's solicita-&#xD;
tions, and drew back from the crowd-Va-&#xD;
lerie was glad to see that the gentle, girlish&#xD;
manner lost nothing in simplicity and grace,&#xD;
but that Alix's bearing was quite as frank&#xD;
and unaffected as when she had nestled by&#xD;
the fountain half an ~honr before. She was&#xD;
very self-possessed, too-for only the deep-&#xD;
ened roses in her cheeks evinced how fast&#xD;
her every pulse was beating and thrilling.&#xD;
It may be that Darcy was to thank for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
At least he did not leave her side, and it&#xD;
seemed as if his presence might have been&#xD;
the secret of her ease, since an observer&#xD;
more careless than Miss Aylmer could have&#xD;
seen that, whatever others were doing or&#xD;
saying, her eyes and her smile sought con-&#xD;
tinually the kind response of his.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE DIAMOND or THE DEsERT.&#xD;
"I ~ said Valerie, with something&#xD;
of a yawn, "that I will go to see Alix this&#xD;
morning. It has been more than a fortnight&#xD;
since she was here, and I have some curi-&#xD;
osity to learn how the de' but comes on."&#xD;
"It will certainly be a kindness," Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant answered-they were quite&#xD;
alone, and perhaps she was glad to dispense&#xD;
with a very restless and listless companion.&#xD;
"I suspect Mrs. Rivi~re is sick; otherwise I&#xD;
am very sure we should have heard some-&#xD;
hing from them. Shall I order the carriage&#xD;
for you?&#xD;
"Thank you, no. It is so clear and bra-&#xD;
cing, that for once I mean to walk."&#xD;
"You will find it very cold."&#xD;
"Tant mieux! I feel as if I needed a&#xD;
tonic, and the air may prove one.'~&#xD;
She felt as if it had already proved one,&#xD;
when, a few minutes later, the hall-door&#xD;
clanged behind her, and she found herself&#xD;
on the frosty pavements. The day was very&#xD;
cold, but still and bright as possible, so&#xD;
bright that The glittering masses of half-&#xD;
frozen snow were painfully dazzling to the&#xD;
eyes. The air was alive with the music of&#xD;
bells, as sleigh after sleigh dashed past; and&#xD;
the hurrying pedestrians were wrapped to&#xD;
their very noses, as if afraid of the touch of&#xD;
the frost-king. So cold, indeed, that Va-&#xD;
lerie half repented of her resolution before&#xD;
she had gone very far, and her teeth were&#xD;
chattering like castanets, when, after a walk&#xD;
of five or six squares, she mounted a flight&#xD;
of steps at the Rivi~res' door, and sent a&#xD;
sharp peal ringing through the house. The&#xD;
servant who answered it informed her that&#xD;
Miss Rivi~re had gone to take a music-les-&#xD;
&#xD;
son. Mrs. Rivi~re, however, was at home;&#xD;
and, on asking for her, she was shown in at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
A flood of sunlight was streaming so&#xD;
brightly across the room into which the&#xD;
maid ushered her, that for a moment Vale-&#xD;
rie's eyes were quite dazzled; then she rec-&#xD;
ognized the charming home-like aspect of&#xD;
the apartment, though it contained scarce-&#xD;
ly a single fashionable article of furniture.&#xD;
But a few green plants arranged in a win-&#xD;
dow, a few va~es, a few flue engraving~ ,&#xD;
and abundance of books, produced an effect&#xD;
which many a gorgeous drawing-room might&#xD;
have envied. Over the piano hung two&#xD;
pictures which were evidently specially&#xD;
prized. One was the well-known "Matinte&#xD;
bei Liszt," where Berlioz, Czerny, and&#xD;
Ernst, are listeningto the great master of the&#xD;
piano-forte harmony; the other, the poet-&#xD;
brow and soul-lit eyes of Felix Mendelssohn.&#xD;
In a niche near the fire stood a low couch,&#xD;
and from this a frail, lovely woman raised&#xD;
herself-a woman whose eyes were bright&#xD;
and whose cheeks aglow with the deceitful&#xD;
lustre and more deceitful bloom of that vic-&#xD;
tor disease which has never yet struck its&#xD;
flag to mortal skill.&#xD;
She came forward as soon as she saw&#xD;
who her visitor was, and met Miss Aylmer&#xD;
with a very sweet and cordial smile, with a&#xD;
grace too so perfect in its dignity and pol-&#xD;
ish that it contrasted strangely enough with.&#xD;
her plaln surroundings. Ah I the French&#xD;
say well of many a noble old tradition and&#xD;
custom, "La B~volution apas~~ 8Ur tout cela,"&#xD;
and to us of to-day the familiar phrase&#xD;
comes in a newer and sadder sense. Yes,&#xD;
the Revolution passed over much, over al-&#xD;
most all that was tender and beautiful in&#xD;
our lives-but it spared us one relic of our&#xD;
past? It wrested from. us the fair heritage&#xD;
of our fathers, it tore our hearts, and dark-&#xD;
ened onr lives, it laid upon. our freeborn&#xD;
necks the yoke of slavery,~it made us exiles&#xD;
and aliens in our native land, it left us&#xD;
scarcely a wish on earth, and scarcely-God&#xD;
help us I-a hope in Heaven, but it failed to&#xD;
take away the high thoughts and noble&#xD;
manners which dignify adversityTas much as&#xD;
they ever adorned prosperity. In many an&#xD;
obscure spot, fallen forever from their high&#xD;

100                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                        THE DIAMOND OF THE DESERT.               1(31&#xD;
&#xD;
estate, we meet, in poverty and grief, the&#xD;
children of our conquered land, but nor pov-&#xD;
erty nor grief can change the old frank&#xD;
grace, the old hospitable impulse, the old&#xD;
inborn and kindly courtesy for high and&#xD;
low. Valerie had felt this often; but never&#xD;
more strongly than when this fair gentle-&#xD;
woman came forward now with outstretched&#xD;
hand, and spoke in the soft, flute-like tones&#xD;
that are so sweet in their every accetit,&#xD;
and so different from the harsh Northern&#xD;
gutturals!&#xD;
*" Miss Aylmer, I am charmed to see you!&#xD;
I am sorry Alix is not at home. But, if you&#xD;
will accept a very indifferent substitute in&#xD;
her place, you will not have to wait long, I&#xD;
hope. I am expecting her return moment-&#xD;
ly. Pray come to the fire. You must be&#xD;
so cold."&#xD;
"I was nearly frozen a moment ago,"&#xD;
Valerie answered, looking into the soft&#xD;
brown eyes, and with all her heart envying&#xD;
Alix her mother. "But this room is so&#xD;
pleasantly warm, I am already beginning to&#xD;
thaw. If you wrn allow me, I will lay aside&#xD;
my furs."&#xD;
"Pray do i-and your hat and cloak&#xD;
also. Let me indulge myself in the luxury&#xD;
of feeling that you are not likely to take&#xD;
wing at any moment, but will certainly be&#xD;
good for an hour or two at ~&#xD;
Miss Aylmer did not need much persua-&#xD;
sion to be induced to comply with this re-&#xD;
quest. Her wrappings were yielded to the&#xD;
soft hand which touched them, and when&#xD;
Alix came in, half an hour later, she found&#xD;
her installed in a low chair by Mrs. Rivi~re's&#xD;
sofa.&#xD;
"Valerie I is it you?" she cried, eagerly.&#xD;
"Mary told me there was a lady with main-&#xD;
me~-but I never thought of you! I am so&#xD;
glad to see you-so glad you came. Have&#xD;
you been here long?"&#xD;
"Notvery long," Valerie answered, with&#xD;
a smile-" indeed not long at all, if I may&#xD;
trust my own ideas of the length of time.&#xD;
But then I have been very pleasantly en- I&#xD;
gaged, while you-.--"&#xD;
"Have been at work," said Alix, gayly,&#xD;
as she came and stood on the hearth-rug,&#xD;
tossing her muff and roll of music on the&#xD;
unoccupied end of her mother's sofa. What&#xD;
&#xD;
a pity it is that everybody's work is not as&#xD;
pleasant as mine! I don't believe I ever&#xD;
8ItQUZZ tire - even of practising scales and&#xD;
trills. -Mamma, Mr. Rosenberg says my&#xD;
notes in the upper register improve every&#xD;
day!"&#xD;
"Does he?" said Mrs. Ilivi~re, laughing&#xD;
a little. "I am glad to hear it-but I am&#xD;
afraid he compliments you too much, Alix."&#xD;
"lie is trying to encourage me," said&#xD;
Alix, gravely. "He thinks I don't know that&#xD;
-but I do! The dear maestro! It certain-&#xD;
ly will not be his fault if I fail-"&#xD;
"It certainly wrn not be the fault of&#xD;
your own daring," said Valerie, who had&#xD;
opened the roll of music and was looking&#xD;
over it. "Your ambition flies high, I per-&#xD;
ceive. The 'Magic Flute,' after Mozart!"&#xD;
"The maestro insisted on it," said Alix,&#xD;
apologetically. "I know I cannot give the&#xD;
echo as it should he done-but he in-&#xD;
sisted!"&#xD;
"Ah,, here is something calculated to&#xD;
take away one's breath -' L'Usignuolo.'&#xD;
Why, miunonne, people will say you are bent&#xD;
upon showing how many conjuror's tricks&#xD;
you caii play with your voice! And what&#xD;
is this-the 'Isoline' of Stigelli! 'Why, how&#xD;
many solos are you to sing?"&#xD;
"Only three," said Alix, smiling. "I&#xD;
shall give that in case of-of"&#xD;
"An encore! Oh, yes, I comprehend-&#xD;
but I suspect you would please your audi-&#xD;
ence better if you sang 'Il Bacio,' or some-&#xD;
thing of that sort, when they call you back.&#xD;
What was it you sang for Mr. Thornton the'&#xD;
other night ?-I mean your last song."&#xD;
"That lovely thing of Abt's-' Dort sind&#xD;
wir Herr.'"&#xD;
"Yes. If you could only give that-&#xD;
but I suppose the maestro knows best. If&#xD;
you are not too tired, go to the piano and&#xD;
sing some for me."&#xD;
"I am ~never too tired to sing," said&#xD;
Alix; and she crossed the room, humming,&#xD;
is she went, that exquisite morceau from&#xD;
bhe "Acis and Galaten:"&#xD;
"'Love in her eyes sits playing&#xD;
And sheds delicious death,&#xD;
Love on her lips is straying&#xD;
And warbling In her breath."'&#xD;
Miss Aylmer smiled to herself. She was&#xD;
&#xD;
fond of tracing cause to effect, and it'&#xD;
chanced that she remembered just then&#xD;
how often she had heard Darcy humming&#xD;
those1identical strains to himself. She did&#xD;
not mention the coincidence, however, but&#xD;
only bade Alix sing the song for her. After&#xD;
it was finished, she glanced at her watch.&#xD;
"I wanted to hear these others, but I&#xD;
see I have not time," she said; "so I will&#xD;
only take my favorite aria from 'St. Paul'&#xD;
before I go."&#xD;
Without answering, Alix changed the&#xD;
measure in which she was playing, struck a&#xD;
few minor chords~ and at once began. Mrs.&#xD;
Ilivi~re lay back on her cushions with closed&#xD;
eyes, and, as the full, silvery voice rose in the&#xD;
touching strains of our Lord's lament over&#xD;
the doomed city of Israel-as all that is&#xD;
most fraught with mournful and tender&#xD;
pathos seemed breathed like the voice of a&#xD;
pitying angel in the cadenced rise and fall&#xD;
of the plaintive melody, large tears slowly&#xD;
gathered on her lashes, and rolled one by&#xD;
one like glittering diamonds over her thin&#xD;
cheeks:&#xD;
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that kill-&#xD;
st the prophets, thou that stones them&#xD;
hat are sent unto thee, how often would I&#xD;
not! ~             cold winter&#xD;
gathered unto thee thy children, and&#xD;
as Valerie listened she seemed to see&#xD;
daylight, but the glowing sky and rich&#xD;
plains of Palestine-not the city streets of&#xD;
throng and noise, but smiling mountains&#xD;
crowned by stately cedars - not ordinary&#xD;
men and women hurrying past, but swarthy&#xD;
forms in picturesque attire, wending their&#xD;
way with camels and horses toward the dis-&#xD;
tautgolden line that marked the domain of&#xD;
he desert-not bare and stunted boughs&#xD;
waving past the window, but feathery palms&#xD;
and shining waters-not dull lines of duller&#xD;
brick, but afar off the royal city of David,&#xD;
and the gleaming walls of the magnificent&#xD;
Temple.&#xD;
It was like a rude sudden call to reality&#xD;
when the music ceased, when one listener&#xD;
dashed away her tears before they had been&#xD;
observed, and the other saw the golden&#xD;
sands, the fringing palms, and distant camels,&#xD;
fade bacl~ into the fair Shadow-land, as the&#xD;
&#xD;
singer turned her radiant face toward them.&#xD;
Before either could speak, however, the&#xD;
door opened, and, with an air of a familiar&#xD;
friend, Darcy entered the room. He did~&#xD;
not see Valerie, who was partially concealed&#xD;
by the sofa; so, with only a smiling saluta-&#xD;
tion to Mrs. Rivi~re, he spoke to Alix.&#xD;
"I am glad to find you in such good&#xD;
voice. I never heard that air better ren-&#xD;
dered, though I have heard it often. I did&#xD;
not care to disturb you, so I waited in the&#xD;
hall till it was finished."&#xD;
"That was unnecessary," said Alix, with&#xD;
a laugh. "I would have finished it all the&#xD;
same, if you had come in-and you never&#xD;
disturb me. Music cannot sound very well&#xD;
through a closed door-do you think so,&#xD;
"Valerie!" Durcy could not help re-&#xD;
peating, in a tone of surprise. Then he&#xD;
turned quickly and saw a pair of 'familiar&#xD;
eyes regarding him from over the arm of&#xD;
Mrs. Rivi~re's sofa.&#xD;
"Did you speak to me, Captain Darcy?"&#xD;
their owner asked, with supreme gravity.&#xD;
"I beg pardon. I really had no idea&#xD;
that you were here," he answered. "No;&#xD;
I did not speak to you when I repeated your&#xD;
name-that is the last liberty I should ever&#xD;
think of taking with Miss Aylmer."&#xD;
The young lady bowed with a good deal&#xD;
of graceful mockery.&#xD;
"Miss Aylmer is much obliged to you.&#xD;
It has not often fallen to her lot to be&#xD;
treated with such grandiose respect; and&#xD;
she is grateful accordingly.-Alix, what did'&#xD;
you ask me?"&#xD;
"Nothing much- only whether you&#xD;
thought music would sound well through a&#xD;
closed door?"&#xD;
"I should say that it depended entirely,&#xD;
on the music. We might be very grateful&#xD;
if we could put half a dozen closed doors&#xD;
between ourselves and some forms of melo-&#xD;
dy. Whether or not tke 'Jerusalem' was&#xD;
improved by it, however~,' is a question for&#xD;
Captain Darcy, not me."&#xD;
It was a question which Captain Darcy&#xD;
did not trouble himself to answer. Tie only&#xD;
smiled; and, taking up a piece ~finusic, be-&#xD;
gan to ask questions about the all-important&#xD;
d~1,ut. Alix answered them as candidly&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8073-00000052"/>&#xD;
102&#xD;
&#xD;
and freely asif she had been talking to her&#xD;
own brother; but, naturally enough, the&#xD;
subject (discussed at second-hand) lacked&#xD;
interest to Miss Aylmer. She turned away,&#xD;
and began a conversation with Mrs. Elvidre,&#xD;
from which, after a while, her attention was&#xD;
drawn, by hearing Alix exclaim:&#xD;
"It is finished! Oh, how charming!-&#xD;
Mamma, do you hear this-the 'Diamond&#xD;
of the Desert'is finished!"&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Mrs. Ilividre, with evi-&#xD;
dently genuine interest. "Captain Darcy,&#xD;
I congratulate you! Or is it a matter for&#xD;
congratulation? I should think it would&#xD;
be a great pleasure to be done-and yet a&#xD;
pain."&#xD;
"You are right," Darcy said. "It is&#xD;
both. Yet, in this instance, more pleasure&#xD;
than pain, I think; so you may certainly&#xD;
congratulate me."&#xD;
"I do, then-most heartily. Of course&#xD;
you have seen and admired it?" she added,&#xD;
turning to Miss Aylmer.&#xD;
"What is 'it' I-a picture? Indeed I&#xD;
have not even heard of it. We see very&#xD;
little of Captain Darcy, and nothing what-&#xD;
ever of his pictures."&#xD;
*" This is an old picture-begun long ago&#xD;
-which I am finishing at the request of Mr.&#xD;
Howard," Darcy said. "He saw it in my&#xD;
studio, took a fancy to it, and offered to&#xD;
buy it; so finishing it became a matter of&#xD;
necessity. It has never been a favorite of&#xD;
mine, however; and that is why I feel&#xD;
more pleasure than pain in the conscious-&#xD;
ness of having it off my hands."&#xD;
"So much the more shame to you!"&#xD;
cried Alix, indignantly. "Valerie, it is&#xD;
beautiful! You ought to see it-indeed, a -&#xD;
bright thought strikes me! Mamma, could 1&#xD;
you bear to be left alone for a little while?"&#xD;
* "I think I could support the desolation&#xD;
for a reasonable time."&#xD;
"Well, then, Captain Darcy, will yuu t&#xD;
take us-Valerie and I-down to your stu- e&#xD;
die?" e&#xD;
It would be hard to say who was most s&#xD;
surprised by this cool request-Valerie or s&#xD;
Darcy. To his credit, however, the latter I&#xD;
recovered himself in a moment, and an-&#xD;
swered readily-&#xD;
"I shall be very happy to do so." a&#xD;
&#xD;
"But here Valerie interrupted. "I am&#xD;
sorry; but you must excuse me, Alix. I&#xD;
have an engagement at home, and it is time&#xD;
that I went to fulfil it."&#xD;
"Gh, no, no!" Alix cried, barring the&#xD;
way as she rose. "Indeed, you must&#xD;
do as I say, this once! Never mind about&#xD;
the engagement! No heart will be broken&#xD;
-or, if it is, you can easily mend it again.&#xD;
You don't know what you will miss, if you&#xD;
don't see the 'Diamond of the Deserts' It&#xD;
will not be put on exhibition, but will be&#xD;
sent at once to Mr. Howard. Besides, I&#xD;
want to go, so much! Mamma is not well&#xD;
enough to accompany me-and of course I&#xD;
cannot go alone. I shall not get to see the&#xD;
picture at all again, if you refuse to go with&#xD;
me. 0 Valerie, please! ~&#xD;
The imploring tones were hard enough&#xD;
to resist, but the fawn-like eyes were infi-&#xD;
nitely harder; and, after a moment, Miss&#xD;
Aylmer surrendered at discretion, saying:&#xD;
"You were certainly born to have your own&#xD;
way, Alix. If I must play chaperon, for&#xD;
the first time in my life, why-I suppose I&#xD;
must! There! go and get your hat."&#xD;
"You will go?"&#xD;
"Yes, I will go."&#xD;
While Alix ran out of the room, her new&#xD;
chaperon looked round for her furs. They&#xD;
chanced to be lying on the piano, and, as she&#xD;
went there after them, Dai~cy seized his op-&#xD;
ortunity and spoke:&#xD;
"Let me thank you for your kindness in&#xD;
giving Miss Rivi~re this pleasure. I am&#xD;
rery glad you have consented to go."&#xD;
* "I feel as if I ought to apologize to you,"&#xD;
he said, coldly. "But you saw how it was&#xD;
-I could not refuse. If it had been possi-&#xD;
)le, I should have done so."&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear that."&#xD;
"Are you? I don't mean to be rude-&#xD;
)ut pray don't let us begin saying pretty&#xD;
hings to each other. We have been hen-&#xD;
st at least, heretofore-let us continue hon.-&#xD;
st to the end. I am going, to please Alix;&#xD;
~ad you don't mind my presence, since it&#xD;
cures hers. That is the state of the case,&#xD;
think-and so, we are neither of us at all&#xD;
edebted to the other."&#xD;
She had been buttoning her cape around&#xD;
s she spoke. She now took up her muff,&#xD;
&#xD;
.4&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
'1'&#xD;
&#xD;
VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DIAMOND&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and walked back to the fireplace, leaving&#xD;
Darcy to think what he pleased of this un-&#xD;
gracious rebuff.&#xD;
After a while Alix came back, as bright&#xD;
and fresh as a sunbeam, and, bidding Mrs.&#xD;
Bivi&amp;amp;e good-morning, the trio started-&#xD;
wending their way from Eutaw Street down&#xD;
to Charles in the teeth of a cutting wind.&#xD;
They walked briskly, however, and soon&#xD;
reached the large marble building at the&#xD;
corner of Lexington Street, where iDarcy had&#xD;
some time since established himself. They&#xD;
climbed a flight or two of stairs, and were&#xD;
rewarded by finding themselves shown into&#xD;
a somewhat cheerless apartment, full of the&#xD;
rubbish and litter that an artist soon gathers&#xD;
around him.&#xD;
"I am only here temporarily," Darcy&#xD;
said, as he saw Valerie's eye wandering&#xD;
over the empty packing-cases that did duty&#xD;
for chairs and tables, the variously-shaped&#xD;
canvases, the unfinished paintings, paint-&#xD;
boxes, paint-rags, the lay figure draped&#xD;
in an Arab ljernowqe, and the other sig-&#xD;
nificantly-artistic tokens of disorder. "It&#xD;
seems scarcely worth while to make one's&#xD;
self comfortable when one may be on the&#xD;
wing any day. Take care of your dress&#xD;
there. Here is the 'Diamond of the Desert'&#xD;
on the easel. Don't compliment it, unless&#xD;
you can do so conscientiously."&#xD;
"I am not likely to flatter," Valerie an-&#xD;
swered, with very unmistakable candor.&#xD;
Then she stood and attentively regarded the&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
If she had expected any thing like the&#xD;
tender and suggestive pathos of "Missing,~,&#xD;
she must have been very much disappointed.&#xD;
Yet perhaps her first feeling was one of as-&#xD;
tonishment that the day vision into which&#xD;
she had fallen over the aria from "St. ~&#xD;
should be, in part at least, so faithfully&#xD;
represented before her. There were the&#xD;
feathery palm~, there the sparkling waters,&#xD;
there the golden sand; there, also, the&#xD;
swarthy, dark-eyed groups in their white&#xD;
turbans and flowing robes, the camels, the&#xD;
barbs, and far off, on the verge of the pur-&#xD;
ple horizon, the domes and minarets of some&#xD;
distant city faintly outlined against the sky.&#xD;
It was a very simple composition-only a&#xD;
group of Arabs resting at an oasis-but it&#xD;
&#xD;
I"a&#xD;
&#xD;
OF THE DESERT.                      103&#xD;
was charmingly painted, the colors soft and&#xD;
clear with all their brilliance, and a pervad-&#xD;
ing tone of freshness and reality that must&#xD;
have struck the most inattentive observer.&#xD;
It was very evident that of idealization, much&#xD;
less of pure fancy, there was literally nothing&#xD;
-it was plainly faithful copy, not of Nature&#xD;
in general, but of Nature in particular. The&#xD;
oasis might perhaps have been a shadow of&#xD;
many oases, but no one could doubt the&#xD;
individuality of every one of the Arabs,&#xD;
whohad unloaded their camels, dismounted&#xD;
from their horses, and lain down on the&#xD;
fresh turf. Perceiving this, Valerie turned&#xD;
to Darcy, and daid, in the tone of one who&#xD;
asserts an undoubted fact:&#xD;
"~You have been in the East, then?"&#xD;
"Yes," he answered. "I spent several&#xD;
years there; and Eastern scenes were, for a&#xD;
time, my specialty. If I were to put on can-&#xD;
vas half the sketches which I outlined on&#xD;
paper-you are fairly tormented with pictu-&#xD;
resque effects in those countries-I should&#xD;
need two lives instead of one to achieve the&#xD;
mere manual labor."&#xD;
"And this is a scene from actual life,&#xD;
then?" asked Alix, eagerly.&#xD;
"Every face there is a portrait," he an-&#xD;
swered; "from old Yusuf the sheik -you&#xD;
see him sitting crossed-legged by the stream&#xD;
-down to the youngest boy. The oasis it-&#xD;
self is to be found not very far outside the&#xD;
walls of Cairo."&#xD;
"That distant city is Cairo ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
She looked intently at the picture for a&#xD;
long time, then turned and said, half-&#xD;
timidly:&#xD;
"How I should like to see your sketch-&#xD;
es! "&#xD;
"Would you?" he asked, with a soft&#xD;
light in his eyes that almost always came to'&#xD;
them at any remark of hers. "Well, that&#xD;
is a very moderate desire, and easily grati-&#xD;
fied. I have a good many with me, and, if&#xD;
you would care to see them now-or any&#xD;
other time-"&#xD;
"Now, of course," she said, eagerly..&#xD;
"Valerie, don't you say so?"&#xD;
But Valerie did not hear. She was~&#xD;
looking at the picture, through her half-.&#xD;
closed hand, and did not even notice that4~&#xD;
&#xD;

104                           YAI~F4UIE&#xD;
the others tur~ied sway. When she did at&#xD;
last wake, with a start, to a consciousness of&#xD;
their absence, and look around, they were&#xD;
deep in a large portfolio, and so absorbed&#xD;
4zat her presence was notat all neee&amp;amp;sary&#xD;
to their enjoyment. After one glance, she&#xD;
moved away in an opposite direction. The&#xD;
studio was a narrow but rather long apart-&#xD;
ment, and, as she strolled toward the lower&#xD;
end of it-pausing now and then'to examine&#xD;
the unfinished pictures and outline etchings&#xD;
which.lined the walls-she almost lost sight&#xD;
of those two heads bending down together,,&#xD;
behind the large easel. It was quite invol-&#xD;
untarily that, coming at last to a corner&#xD;
where several canvases were stacked to-&#xD;
gether, she turned the first one around. A&#xD;
glimpse was enough to make her draw it&#xD;
into a better light, and then she stood trans-&#xD;
fixed by admiration.&#xD;
The scene represented an opera-box,&#xD;
from which, drawing aside the curtain with&#xD;
one hand, a girl, with a face of richly-tinted&#xD;
beauty, looked forth in what seemed a flush&#xD;
*        of triumphant power and self-possession.&#xD;
At least the attitude could only have been&#xD;
so interpreted-there was such a regal pose&#xD;
of the head, such a challenge in the dark&#xD;
eyes, rippling over with all the sunny light&#xD;
and soft languor of the South. An ivory-&#xD;
mounted lorgnette lay on the cushions be-&#xD;
*        fore her, together with a libretto and one&#xD;
white kid glove, while a half-closed fan was&#xD;
held to the scarlet lips by the most slender&#xD;
of hands. The shoulders, from which the&#xD;
cloak had slipped back, gleamed lustrously&#xD;
white against a dark background, and the&#xD;
whole effect was so glowing and perfect,&#xD;
that Valerie exclaimed half aloud, "How&#xD;
exquisite!"&#xD;
Yet, even as the words passed her llps, a&#xD;
discovery flashed upon her which made her&#xD;
sink into a seat, and' stare at the picture in&#xD;
blank amazement, Surely there was some-&#xD;
thing strangely familiar in the face, which&#xD;
bent so graciously and smilingly toward&#xD;
her! Surely she had met before the soft&#xD;
depths of those liquid eyes! There was n~&#xD;
doubt of it-the face was her own!&#xD;
What she would have said or done, it is&#xD;
impossible 'to conjecture, for at that moment&#xD;
a quiet voice behind her asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.                                             ON THE HEIGHTS.                     10&#xD;
&#xD;
'~"And what do you think of your like.&#xD;
ness?"&#xD;
She started and turned-for once visibly&#xD;
confused-to meet the smiling eyes of Mau-&#xD;
rice Darcy.&#xD;
'"Mine! is it really mine?" she stam-&#xD;
mered.&#xD;
"Can there be a doubt of it? Did you&#xD;
ever see a face like that, out of your mirror?"&#xD;
"But how could you-I never gave you&#xD;
a sitting!"&#xD;
He laughed outright.&#xD;
'"Never a conscious one, I grant you;&#xD;
but I am very quick to catch a likeness, and&#xD;
you know I have seen you constantly. I&#xD;
ought to explain and apologize, perhaps," he&#xD;
added, more seriously. "You would have a&#xD;
right to think that I had taken a great lib-&#xD;
erty, if I did not assure you that I have only&#xD;
done so to gratify my uncle. He saw some&#xD;
of my portraits once, and said that he would&#xD;
like me to paint yours. I knew you would&#xD;
never consent to a course of sittings, so I&#xD;
could only promise him to catch the likeness&#xD;
without troubling you-and that is my ex-&#xD;
cuse."&#xD;
Valerie bit her lips quickly; and it&#xD;
would be hard to tell-hard, perhaps, for&#xD;
herself to have told-the cause of the sud-&#xD;
den shadow which came over her face, as&#xD;
if his explanation had been in some sense a&#xD;
disappointment.&#xD;
"You give me credit for more perversi-&#xD;
ty than I possess," she said, coldly. "Of&#xD;
course I would have sat for you-if grand.&#xD;
papa wished it."&#xD;
"It was more the desire to spare you a&#xD;
disagreeable thing, than a beief in your per-&#xD;
versity, which induced me to choose this&#xD;
mode of obtaining a portrait," he answered.&#xD;
"You see I have succeeded-~.moderately at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"I see you have flattered my face al-&#xD;
most beyond recognition."&#xD;
"Yen think so?" and his eye travelled,&#xD;
with the quick artist-gaze, from original to&#xD;
copy, and then back again. "Well-I do'&#xD;
not agree with you."&#xD;
~" I doubt if you are a good judge," she&#xD;
retorted. "How should you know any&#xD;
thing about my face? You certainly don't~&#xD;
know me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is that a necessary preliminary?"&#xD;
"I have always thought so."&#xD;
"And I have always thought the re&#xD;
verse. Instead of knowing the face fron&#xD;
the character, we know the character fron&#xD;
the face. That is the reason why artists ar&#xD;
generally good physiognomists."&#xD;
Valerie looked quickly at the picture&#xD;
There were many soft lights common to he&#xD;
face, many gentle and tender expressions t&#xD;
her eyes-but none of them were there&#xD;
The artist's hand had transferred to his can&#xD;
vas, line by line, and tint by tint, her phys&#xD;
ical beauty, but never a shadow of augh'&#xD;
that was spiritually lovely. In the brillian'&#xD;
eyes she only saw the satisfaction of con&#xD;
scious power; on the perfect lip, only&#xD;
smile of haughty vanity. She turned to hin&#xD;
at last, and spoke with a strange bitterness~&#xD;
in her voice.&#xD;
"Then what I see in that face is you:&#xD;
conception of my character?"&#xD;
"Do you object to it?" he asked, smil&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
She made a gesture of impatience&#xD;
"That is no reply to my question. Please&#xD;
be good enough to answer me."&#xD;
Then he answered, gravely: "It is th~&#xD;
only one I have been able to form. W4&#xD;
jud~e according to sight, you know."&#xD;
"Yes," she said, with a half gasp, ~~W4&#xD;
judge according to sight-no matter ho~&#xD;
far wrong sight may take us~ Not that yoi&#xD;
are wrong in this. You may be very right&#xD;
No one knows less than I do."&#xD;
At that, she turned away, and walke&#xD;
toward Alix, who looked up in some sur&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
"how long you have been, dear!" shi&#xD;
said. "I sent Captain Darcy for you, and:&#xD;
thought neither of you was coming back&#xD;
I wanted to show you this scene in Damas&#xD;
ens. Is it not charming-just like the Ara&#xD;
bian Nights?"&#xD;
"Yes, exactly," Valerie answered, a&#xD;
she bent over the sketch. A moment later&#xD;
one large hot drop had blurred the dome o&#xD;
a mosque thereon, though where it cam&#xD;
from no one could tell.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
O~I THE HEIGHTS.&#xD;
1.&#xD;
As the days went on, and the time of&#xD;
Miss Rivi~re's dibut approached, a knowl-&#xD;
edge of the fact which, up to that time, had&#xD;
been kept a partial secret, began to transpire&#xD;
among her friends and acquaintances. Con-&#xD;
sequent upon this, the poor child was forced&#xD;
- to run a gantlet of inquiries and remon-&#xD;
- stances, of dark intimations of failure, and&#xD;
t darker threats of certain social penalties&#xD;
t that in such a case would be enforced&#xD;
against her and hers. Ali this came sudden-&#xD;
~ ly and without preparation, and those who&#xD;
1 knew her best scarcely realized the courage&#xD;
with which she had nerved herself for the&#xD;
issue until they saw how gallantly she&#xD;
breasted this preliminary storm of opposi-&#xD;
tion. If such an ordeal had been foretold&#xD;
- for her, no doubt they would all have feared&#xD;
that it would shake her resolution. But,&#xD;
on the contrary, it only seemed to strength-&#xD;
~ en it. Inquiries she answered with calm&#xD;
affirmation; remonstrances she put aside&#xD;
s with quiet disdain; while the threats of&#xD;
~ social penalty brought a ~nore scornful light&#xD;
to her eyes than had ever been seen there&#xD;
~ before. "What is your idol to me?" she&#xD;
r cried, contemptuously. "When we were&#xD;
1 rich and prosperous, society ,was at our feet&#xD;
-in our reverses, it has barely tolerated us,&#xD;
extending one finger when we met! Now&#xD;
I it may ignore us, for all I care. Our friends&#xD;
- we shall keep-the rest are better lost than&#xD;
retained!" For the prophecies of failure,&#xD;
s she had only one answer-" That remains&#xD;
[ to be proved." And, as she went on her&#xD;
way, all faithful and unsparing of labor to&#xD;
- herself, all gentleness and tenderness to her&#xD;
- parents, all steadfast defiance to the world,&#xD;
many thought, and Valerie among them,&#xD;
~ that they had never witnessed a more touch-&#xD;
ing and beautiful sight.&#xD;
f But still there were moments when the&#xD;
s head drooped and the courage gave way-&#xD;
moments when the poor little flower came&#xD;
to her friend trembling and downcast. "Oh,.&#xD;
I dread it so unspeakably! " she would says&#xD;
with her wistful eye full of tears. "I am&#xD;

106                       VALERIE AYLMER.                                                                  ON THE HEIGhTS.                      107&#xD;
&#xD;
afraid-oh, lam terribly afraid! I feel as if&#xD;
I should not he able to utter one note when&#xD;
I stand before all that sea of faces. I feel as&#xD;
if something wouldrise up in my throat and&#xD;
choke me, and that I shall end by disgracing&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
" And gratifying all your kind friends,"&#xD;
said Miss Aylmer, coolly. "Don't forget&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
"Yes, that is just it! "she cried passion-&#xD;
ately. "It almost kills me to think how&#xD;
they will exult and shake their heads, and&#xD;
say 'Poor thing, I told her so!' And when&#xD;
I think of them, I feel that I will suc-&#xD;
ceed."&#xD;
" Think of them all the time, then.~,&#xD;
"Ah, but sometimes even that thought&#xD;
fails me. Sometimes I feel as if to meet the&#xD;
cold glances and the critical eyes must extin-&#xD;
guish all my courage, and that I shall cover&#xD;
my face with my hands and cry out to Mr.&#xD;
Rosenberg to take me away. I can see&#xD;
myself do it, as plainly as if I were looking&#xD;
at a picture."&#xD;
"Alix, you must put such fancies as&#xD;
these out of your head-you must not en-&#xD;
courage them. They are enough to make&#xD;
you fail. There is no danger-there cannot&#xD;
be the least danger-if you do not give way&#xD;
to nervous fear. Think what your failure&#xD;
would be to your parents!"&#xD;
"I do think of it," she answered, mourn-&#xD;
fully. "That thought alone enables me to&#xD;
persevere, I try to reme~nber that God has&#xD;
given me one talent-one poor little ewe-&#xD;
lamb-and I must not strangle it with my&#xD;
own hands when it may enable me to aid&#xD;
them. But Valerie, Valerie, it is hard-&#xD;
harder than I ever thought it would be!"&#xD;
Mrs. Rivi~re, too, confided to Valerie&#xD;
forebodings which were never by any chance&#xD;
betrayed to Alix herself. "She suffers very&#xD;
much," the, mother said; "and it pains me&#xD;
to the heart to think that I cannot aid her&#xD;
in bearing it, My poor child! So young,&#xD;
and so totally unfit for such a burden!"&#xD;
"But she has such a brave heart," Miss&#xD;
Aylxner answered, "And she is so confi-&#xD;
dent of her own power! Do not fear. She&#xD;
is resolved to succeed-she will do so,"&#xD;
Mrs, Rivi~re shook her head. All&#xD;
.Alix's buoyant bearing had not availed to&#xD;
&#xD;
deceive those watchful eyes. "You are&#xD;
mistaken," she said. "You do not look so&#xD;
closely as I do, or you would hear many a&#xD;
quiver under those gay tones, and see many&#xD;
a doubt lurking under that bright smile.&#xD;
She is brave, but she is fighting against her&#xD;
own fear. I begin to dread lest it prove an&#xD;
unequal combat; I begin to think that at&#xD;
the very last she may fail, from pure ner-&#xD;
vous terror."&#xD;
"I cannot think so," Miss Aylmer said&#xD;
-but, in truth, she began to be dismayed&#xD;
herself. "I cannot believe but that the oc-&#xD;
casion will give her the courage of desper~&#xD;
ation, and so carry her through."&#xD;
"I do not know whether to wish for it&#xD;
or not. It might be better for her not to&#xD;
sing at all, than to sing so badly that she&#xD;
will ruin her future prospects."&#xD;
"Does Mr. Rosenberg share your fears?"&#xD;
Valerie asked, after a pause.&#xD;
"Not at all. But then Mr. Rosenberg,&#xD;
like yourself' does not look below the sur-&#xD;
face."&#xD;
"You dome great injustice," the other&#xD;
protested. "I do look below the surface,&#xD;
and I see all that natural fear and doubt to&#xD;
which you allude. But I don't believe that&#xD;
it will prevent Alix from appearing, and&#xD;
from doing full justice to her voice when she&#xD;
does appear. And now, dear madame, it re-&#xD;
mains for time to show which of us is the&#xD;
true prophet."&#xD;
"I doubt if anybody ever desired more&#xD;
earnestly that honor should fall on a rival's&#xD;
head," Mrs. Rivi~re said, smiling; "or if&#xD;
ever a prophet was more willing to forfeit&#xD;
all claim to the reputation of seer."&#xD;
Strange to say, for once in her life Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant acted in a manner which&#xD;
nobody expected of her. Notwithstanding&#xD;
her previous censure of such a step, she took&#xD;
up .AJix's cause warmly, applauded her cour-&#xD;
age, promised all possible assistance, and in&#xD;
short (to Mr. Rosenberg's great disgust!),&#xD;
took the whole affair under her sublime&#xD;
wing. What was the meaning of this sud.&#xD;
den change of opinion, it would be difficult to&#xD;
say; but there was at least good reason for&#xD;
supposing that the consideration of Darey's&#xD;
penokant, and a desire to encourage it, had&#xD;
something to do with the matter. Certain-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly there was a long consultation wih Julian,&#xD;
then the carriage was ordered, and the lady&#xD;
drove straight to the Rivi~res to tender her&#xD;
all-powerful aid and countenance. Of course&#xD;
it was gratefully accepted-the more grate-&#xD;
fully, because almost every other one of their&#xD;
newly-made friends had been loud in re-&#xD;
monstrance, or cold in disapproval; and also&#xD;
because the world of fashion was always&#xD;
sure to follow wherever that white finger&#xD;
pointed. When Madame Vacquant said in&#xD;
her soft, high-bred voice, "My dear, I will&#xD;
be glad to do all in my power to insure&#xD;
your success," she was pledging not only&#xD;
herself, but the entire l~eau monde; and&#xD;
Alix, knowing this, was proportionally&#xD;
warm in thanks-thanks that would not&#xD;
have been rendered if there had been a sus-&#xD;
picion of vulgar patronage in the matter.&#xD;
But her worst enemy never failed to admit&#xD;
that the fair society-leader knew how to&#xD;
confer a favor with inimitable tact and&#xD;
grace; and she was scarcely likely not to&#xD;
have employed both the one~ and the other&#xD;
here.&#xD;
The day of the concert at last came, and&#xD;
in the afternoon Miss Aylmer went to see&#xD;
whether Alix's courage wavered or in-&#xD;
creased as the hour of fate approached.&#xD;
She found her sitting by her mother's sofa,&#xD;
very 'quiet, very pale, hut also very com-&#xD;
posed. They both glanced up with a smile&#xD;
when the well-known face came in, and&#xD;
Alix gave one cry-&#xD;
"She is charming!"&#xD;
"Who is charming~~~ Valerie asked.&#xD;
"Why, Madame Baroni, of course 1"&#xD;
the other answered, a little indignantly.&#xD;
"Who else should I mean? Mr. Rosenberg&#xD;
took me to see her this morning-and oh,&#xD;
Valerie, I can never be afraid of her again!"&#xD;
"Well, that is one comfort," her frieild&#xD;
replied. "I should think this might serve&#xD;
to convince you that your other fears are&#xD;
quite as shadowy.-Mrs. Rivi~re, does she&#xD;
need a tonic?~'&#xD;
" I don't think so," Mrs. Rivi~re an-&#xD;
swered, with her peculiarly sweet smile.&#xD;
"She went off very pale and trembling to&#xD;
see Madame Baroni; but she came back&#xD;
full of courage, and I don't ~believe it has&#xD;
ebbed since."&#xD;
&#xD;
"She is so kind," Alix said, with effu-&#xD;
sion. "It would have been ungrateful to&#xD;
feel afraid any more-at least of her. She&#xD;
encouraged me to persevere - praised my&#xD;
voice-told me about her own dti but, when&#xD;
she was so frightened she could scarcely&#xD;
sing a note-and predicted that sonxe, day I,&#xD;
would be a great cantatrice. Think of that,&#xD;
mamma!"&#xD;
"Yes, think of it," Valerie said. "Think&#xD;
of cities at your feet, and nations ringing&#xD;
with your praise, of whole assemblies trans-&#xD;
ported to enthusiasm by your voice, and of&#xD;
ovations that royalty might envy-"&#xD;
"Not to speak of substantial profits."&#xD;
"Not at all. Oh, child, how happy you&#xD;
,are 1-and how little you appreciate your&#xD;
happiness! You hold your future in your&#xD;
own hand, and you win bread and fame by&#xD;
the exercise of that which is to you delight.&#xD;
Think of the myriads who spend life in a&#xD;
toil that is utterly hateful to them; and&#xD;
thank God for giving you the capability of&#xD;
labor that can be loved."&#xD;
"I do," she said, humbly; "I do thank&#xD;
Him with all my heart. I look at the poor&#xD;
drudges who teach, at the poor slaves who&#xD;
sew, and I ask myself what have I done to&#xD;
be so greatly blessed above them-blessed&#xD;
in a gift, but, for which, I could anticipate&#xD;
no higher existence than theirs."&#xD;
"And when you think of Music-of her&#xD;
grand and glorious loveliness-of the beauty&#xD;
that is nearer Heaven than aught alse left&#xD;
us at the Fall-do you not feel your terrors&#xD;
grow petty and unworthy in presence of a&#xD;
mistress so sublime?~~&#xD;
"Yes," she said, with the shining smile&#xD;
of a St. Cecilia, "I do-indeed I do!"&#xD;
"That, then, is a point where it will he&#xD;
well to leave you,~~ and she rose to go.&#xD;
"No, I cannot stay longer. It will soon be&#xD;
time for you to begin your toilet, and I&#xD;
must not detain you from that. Alix, when&#xD;
I see you again, the Rubicon will be passed;&#xD;
and, as I now say to you, be of good heart.&#xD;
-and prove that the blood which has made&#xD;
the sons of our land famous is not less fruit-&#xD;
ful of' heroism in her daughters. So I will&#xD;
then congratulate~ you on having won a two-&#xD;
fold victory: one over circumstance, and a&#xD;
harder one over yourself."&#xD;

"God grant it!" said the mother's&#xD;
solemn tones.             -&#xD;
"Amen!" said Alix, softly.&#xD;
-When Miss Aylmer reached home, it was&#xD;
nearly 'sunset, and the western sky had&#xD;
been dazzling her- eyes with its glory, so&#xD;
that she did not at all recognize a dark fig-&#xD;
ure hurrying forward to meet her until they&#xD;
met on the door-step, and then she saw&#xD;
Roinney. As he uncovered his head, and&#xD;
the full light of the incarnadine west fell&#xD;
over his face, she was startled to observe -&#xD;
how worn and pale he looked.&#xD;
-. "Julian!" she said, stopping short.&#xD;
"Something is surely the matter-or has&#xD;
happened to you. What is it?"&#xD;
- She asked the question anxiously, but i1~&#xD;
was more the auxietyof one who fears some&#xD;
unpleasant responsibility, than that of a&#xD;
woman quick to perceive through her affec-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"Nothing of any importance," 'he an-&#xD;
swered, with a forced smile; "at least I&#xD;
don't suppose you would consider it of im-&#xD;
-portance. Your friend Miss Rivi~re seems&#xD;
to occupy all your available attention just&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"I thought she needed it, but you look&#xD;
this evening as if you needed it more. Pray&#xD;
tell me what is the matter-if it is any&#xD;
thing I can help."&#xD;
"So you don't care to hear, in case that&#xD;
it is not?"&#xD;
"Did I say- that? How strangely per-&#xD;
verse you are! Surely you are not foolish&#xD;
again," she added, a little impatiently.&#xD;
"If foolish means jealous, no," he an-&#xD;
swered. "But-~-ah, the door is open, and&#xD;
perhaps- it is as well I should not take all&#xD;
Charles Street into my confidence. Will&#xD;
you come in?" -&#xD;
She went in, but paused at the- foot of&#xD;
the staircase with decided determination on&#xD;
her- face.&#xD;
"Now," she said, "I insist on the com-&#xD;
pletion of that sentence. But-what?".&#xD;
- "As if you cared!" he said, passionate-&#xD;
ly. "-As if I might not be swept out of&#xD;
your path to-morrow without your sending&#xD;
a single eigh after me-unless it was a sigh&#xD;
of relief! For Heaven's sake, don't~ mock&#xD;
me with such a question, or-I wrn not an-&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
swer for the consequences. You should not&#xD;
tempt me to break your own commands,&#xD;
and~ then grow angry at the temerity."&#xD;
"I did not mean to do that," she said,&#xD;
softly-moved more than she cared to con-&#xD;
fess by his tone and manner-then she came&#xD;
a step nearer and laid her hand on his arm.&#xD;
"Julian! why will you always speak of me&#xD;
as if I were ready to work you great harm?&#xD;
Why not regard me as one who would do&#xD;
almost any thing to spare you pain?"&#xD;
"Almo8t any thing?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Then," he said, with something of a&#xD;
hoarse laugh, "be sure I will test you very&#xD;
soon. There I I dare not say any thing&#xD;
more now. And don't look at me in that&#xD;
way, or-I will! You have to dress, I&#xD;
know. Don't let me detain you."&#xD;
"I am going, but-say something first,&#xD;
that is like yourself. I can't bear to leave&#xD;
you in such a mood."&#xD;
"What shall I say? That your eyes&#xD;
were never brighter or your voice more&#xD;
sweet-that is like my usual self, I believe.&#xD;
But I should think you would grow tired of&#xD;
such platitudes."&#xD;
"Yes, tired and vexed," she answered,&#xD;
withdrawing her hand, and turning away.&#xD;
"I don't understand you. I did not think&#xD;
you would treat me so, but-no ~&#xD;
He let her go without a word, and she&#xD;
was half-way up the staircase, before he sud-&#xD;
denly rushed after her, caught her hand,&#xD;
and, before she knew it, had pressed it many&#xD;
times, passionately to his lips.&#xD;
"Julian!" she cried, half-angrily.&#xD;
Then he dropped it, and looked up with&#xD;
imploring eyes.&#xD;
"Forgive me!" he said. "Forgive me,&#xD;
not for this, but for my churlish despair.&#xD;
Yes, I will hope. It is only a coward who&#xD;
dare not do so. You shall not find me in&#xD;
this mood again."&#xD;
Nor did she-at least not that night.&#xD;
When she came down to dinner, i~ was a&#xD;
very gay and gallant cavalier who met her&#xD;
at the door of the dining-room, and, while&#xD;
dessert was still on the table, the carriage&#xD;
was announced.&#xD;
"We cannot afford to be late to-night,"&#xD;
said Madame Vacquant, rising at once. "I&#xD;
&#xD;
ON TE&#xD;
&#xD;
would not miss Alix's first appearance for&#xD;
any consideration. -My dear, I am so sorry&#xD;
you cannot come "-this to M. Vacquant,&#xD;
whom the gout kept at home.-" Maurice,&#xD;
may I trouble you for my cloak?"&#xD;
While Darcy dutifully wrapped the&#xD;
white folds around her stately figure, Julian&#xD;
was performing the same office for Valerie;&#xD;
and, in so doing, found time to ask:&#xD;
"AmI forgiven?"&#xD;
"That depends on your future conduct,"&#xD;
she answered, with a bright smile. "But&#xD;
you must take me down to the carriage as&#xD;
an earnest of it."&#xD;
They soon disembarked before the bril-&#xD;
liant entrance of the Concordia; but, truth&#xD;
to tell, Valerie had very little appreciation&#xD;
or recollection of the concert as a concert.&#xD;
And after-events completely drove from her&#xD;
mind even the faintest remembrance of how&#xD;
the great prima donna sang. Mr. Rosenberg&#xD;
had thought it best for x~o one to b~ with&#xD;
Alix but himself, so the Vacquant party -&#xD;
found Mr. and Mrs. Rivi~re in the orchestra-&#xD;
chairs, adjoining their own-~hairs very&#xD;
near the stage, and altogether the best in&#xD;
the house for the double purpose of seeing&#xD;
and hearing. Valerie's heart was with the&#xD;
poor child who was struggling, and fighting&#xD;
herself, all rtlone behind the scenes; and, for&#xD;
once in her life, she, was deaf even to music.&#xD;
She had only a faint, dream-like impression&#xD;
of the magnificent-looking woman, with her&#xD;
powerful voice, her brilliant execution, her&#xD;
gleaming silk, - and flashing jewels, who&#xD;
brought down such storms of applause from&#xD;
the - house. Even a Polonaise of Chopin,&#xD;
and a concerto of Mendelssohn, failed to&#xD;
move her. She heard little, and saw less,&#xD;
until near the close of the first- part, an eager&#xD;
movement of Mrs Rivi~re's said more plainly&#xD;
than words, "There she is! "-and a round&#xD;
of welcoming applause made -Valerie look up&#xD;
quickly to see Mr. Rosenberg's white-kid&#xD;
glovesjeading forwaul a brown-eyed Tita-&#xD;
nia in a cloud of India muslin.&#xD;
All the interested party drew their&#xD;
breath- quickly, and then held it in a sharp&#xD;
tension of anxiety and hope. Indeed, the&#xD;
most indifferent stranger might have found&#xD;
it hard to gaze quitc unmoved at the fair&#xD;
&#xD;
HEIOUTS.                           109&#xD;
face and childlike form of the young de~bu-&#xD;
tante, as she stood before the foot-lights -in&#xD;
all the solitary grace of her youth. She&#xD;
looked so refined, so modest, so altogether&#xD;
beautiful, that there was a quickening in-&#xD;
terest on many a face lately apathetic, and&#xD;
a half-murmured, "How l~vely!~~ from&#xD;
many lips lately careless. Lovely, indeed,&#xD;
she was-rarely lovely; but one glance at&#xD;
the poor little flower showed those eager&#xD;
eyes watching her ~o closely that her cour-&#xD;
age was ebbing fast. She was terribly&#xD;
pale, and trembled visibly-but she was&#xD;
making a brave battle of it, and fighting a&#xD;
stern fightfor self-control The first spon-&#xD;
taneous tribute of applause subsided, was&#xD;
acknowledged by a timid salutation, and&#xD;
then silence settled over the house-silence&#xD;
profound and expectant; but, to that trem-&#xD;
bling heart, who shall say how awful! Mr.&#xD;
Rosenberg took his seat at the piano, the&#xD;
first violinist of the orchestra drew his bow&#xD;
softly across the strings; but the singer&#xD;
seemed momently losing both self-possession&#xD;
and self-control. The maestro was evidently&#xD;
very uneasy. He played a prelude of un-&#xD;
usual length-during the course of which&#xD;
Valerie saw Alix's fingers lacing and inter-&#xD;
lacing over the sheet of music she held, and&#xD;
her breast heaving convulsively-but at last&#xD;
he could delay no longer. He murmured&#xD;
something hurriedly over his shoulder, and&#xD;
struck the first chords of the accompani-&#xD;
ment. Alix made one desperate ~ffort to&#xD;
sing-her voice failed her! Another equal-&#xD;
ly desperate-with equally ill success. Then&#xD;
she paused, evidently struggling with a~ wild&#xD;
desire to burst into tears, and rush from the&#xD;
stage. The stillness of the next few minutes&#xD;
was terrible. Mrs. Rivi~re laid her hand&#xD;
down on the one beside her with a g~sp&#xD;
Miss Aylmer never forgot; but her glance&#xD;
did not once tarn from her daughter's face.&#xD;
Mr. Rosenberg rose and went to-Alix's side,&#xD;
the leader of the orchestra leaned forward,&#xD;
and spoke a few kind words of encourage-&#xD;
ment. But it all seemed to little purpose,&#xD;
and a perfect despair settled over the watch-&#xD;
ers. To f.~il-and thus! Murmurs of com-&#xD;
passion began to be heard, together with&#xD;
well-meant whispers of "Better take hey&#xD;
off!"&#xD;
&#xD;

OUT OP THE DEPTHS.                     111&#xD;
&#xD;
110                     VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
At that moment Darcy, who was sitting&#xD;
just behind Valerie, laid his hand on her&#xD;
shoulder. "Let her mother show herself,"&#xD;
he whispered, eagerly. "That will restore&#xD;
her courage-if any thing can!" Miss Ayl-&#xD;
iner turned to Mrs. Rivi~re, but she had&#xD;
heard him, and immediately rose to her feet,&#xD;
and leaned forward toward the stage, utterly&#xD;
unmindful that she was thus a mark for the&#xD;
observation of the whole house, if the house&#xD;
had not been too much occupied to observe&#xD;
her. Alix's eyes were w~stfulIy turned on&#xD;
the audience, as if seeking that face among&#xD;
all others, and many noticed the start with&#xD;
which s~e recognized it. The effect was&#xD;
scarcely less instantaneous. Color flashed&#xD;
into her cheeks, and light into her eyes; she&#xD;
made a motion as if swallowing some im-&#xD;
pediment in her throat, and, laying her&#xD;
hand on Mr. Rosenberg's arm, pointed to&#xD;
*    the piano. He hesitated, but she said a few&#xD;
words, and he resumed his seat. Then, as&#xD;
she once more fronted the audience, with&#xD;
resolution on her face-such resolution as&#xD;
that with which men go to storm a battery&#xD;
-some kindly chivalric hand in the gallery&#xD;
gave a signal of applause, to which the body&#xD;
of the house eagerly responded. When it&#xD;
subsided, the battle was fought and won!&#xD;
She began to sing, and the first tone of her&#xD;
voice assured everybody that the worst was&#xD;
over, and that no further hesitation was to&#xD;
b~ feared. Perhaps it was desperation&#xD;
which gave her strength, but at least it bore&#xD;
her bravely through. She had never in her&#xD;
life done fuller justice to herself or to her&#xD;
teacher. Even those whose hearts were&#xD;
bound up in herforgot for the moment the&#xD;
singer in the music, and listened with enrap-&#xD;
tured attention to those fairy-like cadences,&#xD;
that exquisite elfin rise and fall of delicious&#xD;
harmony which is the immortal heritage be-&#xD;
queathed usby the master's immortal genius.&#xD;
There was not a musical ear in the house&#xD;
which was not charmed by the sweetness!&#xD;
and compass of those wonderfulnotes, which&#xD;
did not perceive at once the rare natural&#xD;
power of the voice, and the purity of execu-&#xD;
tion, the almost perfect style of the vocaliza-&#xD;
tion. They had expected at best little more&#xD;
than a mediocre capability in this trembling&#xD;
debutante, and they found themselves coin-&#xD;
&#xD;
pletely taken by surprise! When the last;&#xD;
echo of the " Magic Flute" died away, there&#xD;
was a pause of absolute astonishment; then&#xD;
the Concordia walls had rarely echoed to a&#xD;
more overwhelming torrent of applause than&#xD;
broke.forth in one wild storm. The Rubi-&#xD;
con was passed indeed! As. far as this gen-&#xD;
erous city was concerned, the young exile's&#xD;
fame was inade-.and even now they were&#xD;
calling her back with every token of fervid&#xD;
enthusiasm. Half-frightened, and trembling&#xD;
more than ever, Alix was led back, and&#xD;
when at last the curtain fell, at the end of&#xD;
the first part, it was amid the still echoing&#xD;
sounds of that which is sweeter than all&#xD;
other music to the ear professional.&#xD;
In the interval which followed, all the&#xD;
Rivi~res's acquaintances gathered round the&#xD;
proud and happy parents with warm con-&#xD;
gratulations. First of all, came Mr. Thorn-&#xD;
ton, though he knew neither of them per-&#xD;
sonally, and held out his hand with frank&#xD;
cordiality. "The tone-world has gained&#xD;
another star!" he said-and it was worth&#xD;
while saying it, to see the bright smile&#xD;
which came, in answer, over Mrs. Rivi~re's&#xD;
face. But, though such compliments as&#xD;
these are the pleasantest of all compliments&#xD;
in the world, no one was sorry when the&#xD;
curtain rose again and the concert recoin-&#xD;
menced. La Baroni sang with all the pow-&#xD;
er and ~pirit which had gained her a world-&#xD;
wide fame; but, nevertheless, there were&#xD;
others now, besides the small group of im-&#xD;
mediate friends, who eagerly waited the re-&#xD;
appearance of the new songstress. At last&#xD;
she came - smiling, blushing, all alive&#xD;
with the full, delicious realization of her&#xD;
success. And how divinely she sang I&#xD;
How purely and evenly the tide of melody&#xD;
flowed from the slender throat-how rich,&#xD;
yet flexible, the voice proved itself whenever&#xD;
there was a demand on strength or a trial&#xD;
of skill-how exquisitely birdlike were the&#xD;
trills-how regular and smooth the scales-.&#xD;
how brilliant the whole execution! It was&#xD;
no wonder that the people applauded as if&#xD;
they were mad; that they encored her again&#xD;
and yet again; or that, when she was recalled&#xD;
for the third time, and stood before them&#xD;
with her glowing face and happy eyes, even&#xD;
ladies joined in the enthusiastic outburst,&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
and gave up their bouquets to be cast at&#xD;
her feet.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
our or THE DEPTHS.&#xD;
SUDDENLY a startled voice cried, "Look&#xD;
at Mrs. Rivi~re!" and, turning quickly, Miss&#xD;
Aylmer saw that she was lying back in her&#xD;
chair, white as marble, with her eyes closed,&#xD;
and a crimson tide flowing from her lips.&#xD;
Her husband had not heard the first voice,&#xD;
but he caught Valerie's exclamation of hor-&#xD;
ror, and turned also.&#xD;
In a moment his face was almost as pale&#xD;
as hers.&#xD;
"My God!" he cried, "it is another&#xD;
kemorrhage I&#xD;
The words had scarcely passed his lips,&#xD;
before all was confusion in their immediate&#xD;
vicinity-a number of people pressing for-&#xD;
ward, an uproar of voices, a dozen different&#xD;
demands in a dozen different keys. Salts&#xD;
-ammonia-water-a fan-the carriage-a&#xD;
doctor-all were recommended and called for&#xD;
in a breath, as it were, while those farther&#xD;
off only thought a lady had fainted from the&#xD;
heat The house went on thundering its&#xD;
plaudits, Alix went on bowing and smiling,&#xD;
while her mother's life was bleeding away.&#xD;
Yet the confusion did not last long. It&#xD;
scarcely needed the grave face of the has-&#xD;
thy-summoned physician to assure the gazers&#xD;
that Azrael had made his own time, and&#xD;
that she on whom they gazed had received&#xD;
the summons which none ever disobey.&#xD;
There was something unspeakably awful-&#xD;
something that no one, looking on, ever for-&#xD;
got-in the contrasts of the scene. Here,&#xD;
the garish realm of pleasure and life, ~he&#xD;
glittering, swaying crowd, the painted ara-&#xD;
bosqued walls, the brilliant Jights, the illu-&#xD;
minated stage-there, the ghastly shadow,&#xD;
the inexorable pre~nce of agony and&#xD;
death. Fortunately the concert was over-&#xD;
all, save an orchestral piece which nobody&#xD;
seemed to care about hearing-Alix had&#xD;
vanished, and the house was emptying&#xD;
fast. The pealing instruments rose and&#xD;
swelled in a harmony which only served to&#xD;
&#xD;
keep time to the rustle and tread of depart-&#xD;
ing numbers, but which formed the last ele-&#xD;
ment of discordance in this horrible scene.&#xD;
Nobody seemed to notice them, excepting&#xD;
Miss Aylmer; but she, who was kneeling&#xD;
by the insensible women, looked up at Dar-&#xD;
cy with a piteous appeal. "For Heaven's&#xD;
sake, go and tell them-go and stop them!"&#xD;
she said. He went, and, a moment later,&#xD;
the gay strain ceased, and the ghastly death-&#xD;
march was over. But, years afterward, Va-&#xD;
lerie heard that air played by other musi-&#xD;
ciansin a far-distant land, and it brought&#xD;
back, as vividly as if she again gazed upon it,&#xD;
the scene of that night, with all its terrible&#xD;
accompaniments.&#xD;
After the first shock was over, Mr. Rid-&#xD;
~re recovered something of his usual self-&#xD;
possession, and sent a note to Mr. Rosen-&#xD;
berg, bidding him detain Alix until some&#xD;
one called for her. Then Mrs. Rivi~re was&#xD;
slowly carried out of the empty house to&#xD;
the carriage which was waiting for her.&#xD;
Miss Aylmer seemed most to retain self-&#xD;
possession, and so it was to her that the&#xD;
doctor turned when he said, "Get in!"&#xD;
She did not understand what he meant to&#xD;
require of her, but she obeyed at once.&#xD;
After she was in the carriage, Mrs. Rivi~re&#xD;
was laid half on the seat, half within her&#xD;
arms, and the doctor following, with Mr.&#xD;
Rivi~re, they drove rapidly away. Nobody&#xD;
mentioned Alix, but Valerie's heart was full&#xD;
of her, and it was a great relief to remember&#xD;
that Darcy had taken on himself the duty&#xD;
of telling her, and bringing her after them.&#xD;
Valerie now began to realize son~iething of&#xD;
what he was, as a sure and steadfast help in&#xD;
time of need; at least there was no one else&#xD;
who could have given her such a feeling of&#xD;
confidence that the blow to that poor, un-&#xD;
prepared heart would be softened as much&#xD;
as human care and tenderness can soften&#xD;
such a stroke-and, God knows, that is little&#xD;
enough!&#xD;
It was very strange and awesome, that&#xD;
drive! Every thing seemed so terrible, and&#xD;
had been so sudden, that it was all unreal to&#xD;
Valerie; and, once or twice, she half-won-&#xD;
dered if she were awake, as the carriage&#xD;
rolled on over the paving-stones, as the pass-&#xD;
ing gleams of the street-lamps fell across the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
death-like face, pillowed on her white opera&#xD;
cloak, and the two men sat opposite, like&#xD;
graven images, neither speaking, and the&#xD;
doctor only leaning forward now and then&#xD;
to lay his finger on the faint pulse.&#xD;
The hinmorrhage had almost entirely&#xD;
ceased by the time they reached upper Eu-&#xD;
taw Street, and, lifting the frail form with&#xD;
as little difficulty as if she had been a child,&#xD;
Mr. Rivi~re bore it into the house which she&#xD;
had left so shortly before in all the flush of&#xD;
life's fullest hopes. He made no pause on&#xD;
the lower floor, though the doctor would&#xD;
fain have drawn him into the first room&#xD;
they reached, but passed directly on to her&#xD;
own chamber, laying her gently and tender-&#xD;
ly down on the bed from which sh~ would&#xD;
never rise again.&#xD;
Every thing that ensued was afterward&#xD;
a very dim remembrance to Miss Aylmer.&#xD;
She knew that she must have been cool and&#xD;
capable of intelligent service, at the 'time,&#xD;
for it was to her that the doctor~ made his&#xD;
demands for every thing he needed, and it&#xD;
was on her that the duty of bringing the&#xD;
frightened household to some order fell.&#xD;
She had not more than accomplished this,&#xD;
and taken her place once more to wipe away&#xD;
the red drops that still slowly came from&#xD;
between the parted lips, when a carriage&#xD;
drove almost at a gallop up to the door.&#xD;
There was the sound of quick voices and&#xD;
hurrying feet, and, before the doctor could&#xD;
interfere to prevent, Alix had rushed into&#xD;
the room, and thrown herself on her knees&#xD;
by her mother's bedside.&#xD;
"0, mother, mother!" she cried, "is&#xD;
this my triumph 1-0 God! she is dead!-&#xD;
it is I who have killed her!"&#xD;
"Hush!" said the doctor, sternly, and,&#xD;
laying a heavy hand on her shoulder, forced&#xD;
her away. "You ~vilZ kill her, if you bring&#xD;
on that hinemorrhage again! Hush, mad~&#xD;
am! "-this to Mrs. Bivi~re - whose lids&#xD;
quivered and whose pale lips faintly strove&#xD;
to speak. "I command you to hush-your&#xD;
life depends upon it! There must not be&#xD;
one word spoken in this room-either by&#xD;
you or any one else.-Miss Bivi~re, come&#xD;
with me down-stairs."&#xD;
"Oh, no, no! "exclaimed poor Alix, witir.&#xD;
a piteous cry of entreaty. "Let me stay&#xD;
&#xD;
with her !-do let me stay with her! I will&#xD;
not utter another word-I promise that!&#xD;
Only try me-you can send me away, if I&#xD;
do!"&#xD;
Th~ doctor 'released his hold. He evi-&#xD;
dently did not like to trust her, and did so&#xD;
reluctantly. But she sank on her knees&#xD;
again so hushed and still that, after amo-&#xD;
ment, he turned away and went to Miss&#xD;
Aylmer.&#xD;
"I suppose I can depend on you!" he&#xD;
said, shortly. "Don't, on any pretext, allow&#xD;
a word to be' spoken-especially by Mrs.&#xD;
Rivi~re herself, or-" he pointed over his&#xD;
shoulder to Alix. "Keep perfect silence.&#xD;
I have sent for Preston, and I must go down.&#xD;
stairs a n~oment. If there is any change,&#xD;
call me."&#xD;
Valerie bent her head, and he walked&#xD;
away. From some cause or other, he&#xD;
did not return for a considerable time,&#xD;
and the still, solemn aspect of the chamber&#xD;
seemed to awe and oppress Miss Ayhner,&#xD;
like the very presence of death itself. In&#xD;
lesser degree, there was the same contrast&#xD;
which had given so much deeper horror to&#xD;
the scene in the opera-house, only now the&#xD;
world was subordinate-sunk into nothing&#xD;
as it were, by the side of that eternity&#xD;
which was so near at hand. We are told&#xD;
very often that we walk on the bolder of&#xD;
eternity, that there is ever only a thin&#xD;
veil between our faces and its awful myste~&#xD;
ries; but it is doubtful whether we ever re-&#xD;
alize the fact until we are brought face to&#xD;
face with some swift tragedy in which the&#xD;
curtain is lifted before our eyes, and we&#xD;
catch a glimpse-a brief, fieetin~ glimpse-&#xD;
of the existence beyond, and of its unspeak-&#xD;
able nearness to our daily lives. Just now,&#xD;
Valerie had this glimpse-just now she&#xD;
seemed to feel in every throb of her own&#xD;
abounding life the sense of death which we&#xD;
carry about with us all the time, and the&#xD;
actual presence of that shadowy world-&#xD;
which in our poor human blindness we call&#xD;
shadowy, when indeed it alone is real!-&#xD;
at whose entrance, this life, now fading from&#xD;
earth, was soon to stand. She had~ not of-&#xD;
ten before come face to face with d$th;&#xD;
and it was long before the scene on which&#xD;
she gazed ceased to haunt her. There lay&#xD;
&#xD;
(1&#xD;
&#xD;
it&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OUT OF TE&#xD;
&#xD;
"V&#xD;
&#xD;
the almost dying womail, with her white&#xD;
face and faintly-pulsating breast-so faintly&#xD;
pulsating, that more than once Valerie&#xD;
thought the breath had ceased. The dim,&#xD;
hushed room looked vast and weird with&#xD;
the dark shadows gathering in its corners,&#xD;
and the outline of its still figures thrown in&#xD;
gigantic relief on the walls. Mr. Rivi~re&#xD;
stood so unmoving at the side of the bed&#xD;
that he might have been taken for a sculp-&#xD;
tured figure, while the gala-dress of Mix,&#xD;
with its misty flounces and French roses,&#xD;
lay all unheeded on the floor, as she knelt&#xD;
with only a convulsive quiver now and&#xD;
then running over her frame; while Valerie,&#xD;
in her shining silk and blood-stained cloak,&#xD;
sat on the bed, with her fingers on the fail-&#xD;
ing pulse of the hand that was lightly clasp-&#xD;
ing hers.&#xD;
It seemed as if many hours passed thus;&#xD;
but it could not have been nearly one-&#xD;
since the confessor who had been sum-&#xD;
moned in haste had not yet arrived-when&#xD;
a slight pressure of her hand made Valerie&#xD;
bend over Mrs. Rivi~re to see what she de-&#xD;
sired. Before it was possible to remon-&#xD;
strate, she had whispered four words-&#xD;
weak and low, yet quite distinct:&#xD;
"Comfort my poor child."&#xD;
Scarcely were they spoken, before the&#xD;
effort brought on the hemorrhage again-&#xD;
and the red tide gushed once more from her&#xD;
lips over the pillows. Alix sprang to her&#xD;
feet and fled to the head of the stairs, calling&#xD;
wildly for the doctor. He came-looked-&#xD;
placed his finger oh the pulse-then turned&#xD;
to Mr. Bivi~re, and said aloud, but very&#xD;
gently, "She is dying."&#xD;
Mrs. Rivi~re~ evidently heard the words.&#xD;
Perhaps he had wished that she should.&#xD;
K      Her eyes opened slowly, and met his with&#xD;
an expression which said, "I know it."&#xD;
Then they turned to Valerie, and, remember-&#xD;
ing the appeal of a moment before, she an-&#xD;
swered instinctively, "I will-I will! "-&#xD;
and that strangely-expressive glance wan-&#xD;
dered to Alix, who stood a little back from&#xD;
the bed, her han~ hanging loosely at her&#xD;
side, and a stonyhorror on her face. The&#xD;
rapidly-dimming sight dwelt on her face&#xD;
for a moment, in unutterable and pitying&#xD;
love; and then the last look turned to her&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
[R DEPThS.                '       113&#xD;
husband, who was bending over with agony&#xD;
too great for utterance. What a volume&#xD;
was in that long gaze !-so much that was&#xD;
perfectly intelligible to the stranger looking&#xD;
on, that it must have been plain as spoken&#xD;
words to him. Once the steady regard was&#xD;
raised toward heaven-~returning immedi-&#xD;
ately to fix itself a gain on his-and the poor&#xD;
blood-covered lips strove to fashion them-&#xD;
selves into a smile-last token of the love&#xD;
which was undying. I~either eyes nor lips&#xD;
moved again.&#xD;
It scarcely needs to dwell on the des-&#xD;
olation which followed. All of us have&#xD;
passed through, or will pass through, such&#xD;
valleys of the shadow of death, and all of&#xD;
us know the black pall which at such times&#xD;
comes over all things-shutting out even&#xD;
the sunlight of God's smile. With Alix,&#xD;
sorrow took the form of dumb apathy.&#xD;
She crouched by the side of that which was&#xD;
once her mother, and moaned to herself like&#xD;
some stricken wild creature of the forest,&#xD;
all the day long 1-she paid no heed to any&#xD;
one-no voice was powerful enough to&#xD;
rouse her-people came and went, spoke to&#xD;
her, talked of her, but she never raised her&#xD;
head-she never acknowledged any other&#xD;
presence than that of the dead. Perhaps&#xD;
of all the forms of human grief, there is&#xD;
none more touching, none more hopeless&#xD;
than this, none so powerful to wring our&#xD;
own hearts with the sorrow of unavailing&#xD;
pity! When thirty-six hours had passed, and&#xD;
still the stunned quiescence was unbroken,&#xD;
still no morsel of food had crossed the pale&#xD;
lips, the doctor thought it necessary to in-&#xD;
terfere. "This will never do 1" he said, de-&#xD;
cidedly. "The body must be removed as&#xD;
soon as possible, or this child will die." Ac-&#xD;
cordingly the funeral arrangements were&#xD;
hastened, and, on the third day after death,&#xD;
they buried away in the kind bosom of&#xD;
Mother Earth the cold shell of mortality&#xD;
that had once enshrined so fair and pure a&#xD;
spirit. To the last, Alix was resolved to at-&#xD;
tend the funeral. But Nature had already&#xD;
been taxed too far. When she went to take&#xD;
a last look of her mother's face, and she saw&#xD;
the lovely and ineffable peace that reigned&#xD;
in every line of it in contrast with her own&#xD;
grief-tom heart, the poor child gave way in&#xD;

&#xD;
one mighty rush of emotion, that east her&#xD;
prostrate beneath its violence.&#xD;
"0 mother, mother!" she sobbed, as&#xD;
the burning shower ran over the face of&#xD;
her who never before had been uncon-&#xD;
scious of her voice, or deaf to her suffering.&#xD;
"Mine is the anguish, but yours the peace!&#xD;
All is over for you-all pain, all fear, all&#xD;
trouble! Your rest is won-but oh, my&#xD;
burden is heavy, heavier than I can bear&#xD;
without you! Oh, come back to' me-or&#xD;
teach me at least to say 'Thy will be done."'&#xD;
She was borne away unresisting, and a&#xD;
strong opiate administered by the doctor's&#xD;
orders. "She will rest now," he said.&#xD;
And she did rest-so deeply that the sad&#xD;
procession passed out of the darkened house,&#xD;
as she lay in unconscious slumber. And&#xD;
while in the dim cathedral the solemn tones&#xD;
of a requiem mass were chanted ~over the&#xD;
silent dust, she still slept-still forgot her&#xD;
pangs for a brief while, as she lay with a&#xD;
crucifix clasped in her hand, and so sweet&#xD;
a smile onthe pallid face, that Valerie hushed&#xD;
her breath, thinking it must be that the&#xD;
mother's spirit had come to comfort her&#xD;
even from those-&#xD;
"Shores where tideless sleep the seas of Time&#xD;
Soft by the city of the saints of God."&#xD;

*         CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
REAPING THE HARvEsT.&#xD;
A FORTNIGHT after this, Valerie was still&#xD;
domicilod at the Rivi~res'. Her heart-al-&#xD;
ways a gentle and pitiful heart to sorrow&#xD;
and distreas-had been sorely touched, and&#xD;
she was as loath to leave Alix and 'go back to&#xD;
the dissipation of the Vacquant household,&#xD;
as Alix would have been loath to see her go.&#xD;
Indeed, as the first wild violence of 'grief&#xD;
abated, giving place to that deep and settled&#xD;
sorrow which time alone can heal, there&#xD;
came also the 'aching sense of desolation-&#xD;
the deep longing for huma~i love and com-&#xD;
panionship which made Valerie's presence&#xD;
with 'her a positive necessity. 'Already,&#xD;
however, the former had mooted a plan&#xD;
which could alone secure this companion-&#xD;
ship for any length of time: Already, she&#xD;
&#xD;
had declared her anxiety, that Alix should&#xD;
leave her own home, so full as it was of&#xD;
painful memories, and accompany her to&#xD;
Washington Place. By degrees only could&#xD;
the latter be brought to entertain such a&#xD;
proposition. She clung passionately to the&#xD;
spot last associated with her mother, and&#xD;
even her father's persuasions were of little&#xD;
avail. Indeed, when no other excuse was&#xD;
left, she would look up at Valerie piteously,&#xD;
and say, "But I cannot leave poor papa all&#xD;
alone." To this Miss Aylmer wisely for-&#xD;
bore immediate answer, for she was sure&#xD;
that even the daughter's eyes could not long&#xD;
fail to perceive that her absence would be to&#xD;
her father more a relief than a deprivation.&#xD;
His love for his wife had been singularly de-&#xD;
voted; l~ut there was little or nothing of&#xD;
what is called "the domestic man" in his&#xD;
nature. He tolerated home-life for her sake&#xD;
but he never learned to like it for its own,&#xD;
and the most superficial observer could not&#xD;
have failed to perceive how strong was his&#xD;
desire to escape the haunting presence of&#xD;
grief-embodied in the darkened house, the&#xD;
vacant couch, his daughter's pale face and&#xD;
black dress-and plunge headlong into the&#xD;
world. There was no doubt but that he&#xD;
would be unfeignedly glad to see Alix safely&#xD;
established at M. Vacquant's fireside, and to&#xD;
lock within the vacant house ~he ghost of&#xD;
his past life and his dead love.&#xD;
Nor was it very long before this desire&#xD;
was plainly manifest even to Alix; not long&#xD;
before she yielded a reluctant consent to&#xD;
Valerie's entreaties, and those which Ma-&#xD;
dame Vacquant came in person to add; not&#xD;
long before she bade a weeping farewell to&#xD;
the rooms where her mother's smile last&#xD;
shone on her, and was driven away to the&#xD;
stately Vacquant mansion, where a sunny&#xD;
room awaited her, and where one heart at&#xD;
least was ready to give her a tender and un-&#xD;
wearied attention.&#xD;
Is it necessary to say that this heart beat&#xD;
within the broad chest of Maurice Darcy?&#xD;
Truly, if he had seemed to like this fair child&#xD;
before, he now devoted himself to her with&#xD;
an~ affection that was touched into deop rev-&#xD;
erence by her silent but enduring grief.&#xD;
Her mother could not have watched over&#xD;
Alix with more untiring care, more con-&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
stantly studied her unspoken wishes, more&#xD;
zealously striven to ease her heart and~ amuse&#xD;
her mind. His regard fairly encompassed&#xD;
her. If ~he remained in her chamber, books,&#xD;
papers, and flowers, were going up in broken&#xD;
detachments all day; if she came, down, he&#xD;
rarely failed to meet her at the foot of the&#xD;
stairs and lead her into the back drawing-&#xD;
room, where her own special sofa stood cov-&#xD;
ered with cushions which he never allowed&#xD;
any one but himself to arrange. Then he&#xD;
would take his seat by her, and leave no&#xD;
means untried to make the rare smile and&#xD;
rarer laugh, until Valerie, looking on in won-&#xD;
dering surprise, could only murmur half-un-&#xD;
consciously to herself:&#xD;
"The bravest are the tenderest,&#xD;
The loving are the daring."&#xD;
Not that Valerie had overmuch time just&#xD;
now for observing Maurice Darcy, or aught&#xD;
that concerned him. Since her return, Ju-&#xD;
han had been her shadow, in public as well&#xD;
as Private-a shadow whom she found it&#xD;
~vellnigh impossible to shake off, and who&#xD;
cost her many an hour of deep and painful&#xD;
disquietude. The end was fast approaching&#xD;
.-she saw that! Not much longer could&#xD;
the "pretty fooling" go on, or could she&#xD;
stave off a serious declaration and its conse-&#xD;
quences; not much longer could shehold at&#xD;
arm's-length the devotion that daily grew in&#xD;
passion and exactitude. An explanation&#xD;
must soon come, and after that-well, per-&#xD;
haps it was part of her punishment that she&#xD;
remembered now her father's warning, and I&#xD;
wished vainly and bitterly that she had&#xD;
heeded it. Ahi there is no telling, but per-&#xD;
haps we might not sow quite so recklessly&#xD;
if we would only bear the, reaping-time in&#xD;
mind; if we would only remember thatthere&#xD;
is no question of liking or regret, no alter-&#xD;
native of evasion, when that inevitable h~u~&#xD;
comes, and the relentless scythe is put into&#xD;
our hand, but, whether we will or no, the&#xD;
harvest must be gathered. Even in the&#xD;
merest worldly sense~there is no wiser max-&#xD;
im than that of "Look to the end." Ay,&#xD;
look to the end, for if we often or ever did&#xD;
so, that end might not be so full of ashes&#xD;
and gall when it comes. Slowly and paln-&#xD;
fully, as all great lessons must be learned,&#xD;
this truth came home to Valerie Aylmer;&#xD;
&#xD;
but the harvest was to be gathered in for all&#xD;
that; nor was it long before the reaping&#xD;
began.&#xD;
It seemed that Madame Vacquant had&#xD;
laid her plans well, for by degrees Valerie&#xD;
began to perceive that society at large con-&#xD;
sidered the affairs between Julian and her-&#xD;
self in the light of a recognized engagement.&#xD;
Men fell back from her side when he ad-&#xD;
vanced, as 'if conceding an acknowledged&#xD;
right; women began to speak of her as of one&#xD;
outside the circle of the disengaged'; and a&#xD;
thousand trifling occurrences proved to her&#xD;
that the matter was regarded as finally set-&#xD;
tled. Perhaps Madame Vacquant would&#xD;
have been wise in this move, if she had not&#xD;
reasoned too much on feminine nature in&#xD;
general, and not enough on Valerie's nature&#xD;
in particular. Some women-many women&#xD;
-are easily influenced by any thing of this&#xD;
kind, and are readily brought to think that&#xD;
when society utters its dictum the matter&#xD;
had best be considered settled; that they&#xD;
have committed themselves past recall, and&#xD;
that it is better to accept the situation than&#xD;
to dare the vague and shadowy consequences&#xD;
of rebellion. But no such womanwas this&#xD;
girl, through whose veins beat hot and strong&#xD;
the warm Southern blood, that, in great or&#xD;
small, never yet benched at a penalty, or&#xD;
regarded a consequence. Therefore, it was&#xD;
not strange that this species of social coer-&#xD;
cion, instead of retarding, rather gave im-&#xD;
petus to the explanation which seemed so&#xD;
near at hand. It seemed near at hand, yet&#xD;
it came at last unexpecte4ly-as most things&#xD;
do come.&#xD;
Valerie's indignation had been very much&#xD;
roused by Romney's attempt to claim a privi-&#xD;
leged right to some favor over the heads of&#xD;
half a dozen other aspirants at a certain ball&#xD;
one night. So when he came, instigated by&#xD;
his mother, to make overtures of peace the&#xD;
next morning, he found his fair mistress in&#xD;
a far from playable mood.&#xD;
"Yes," she said, after listening to all his&#xD;
ready-made penitence, "that is very fine, but&#xD;
I have heard it rather too often. I should like&#xD;
some substantial proof of regret before issu*&#xD;
ing another official pardon. No-pray don't&#xD;
interrupt me. I know exactly what you are&#xD;
going to say. I atn fully prepared to hear&#xD;

that I must stand your excuse, and all that&#xD;
sort of' thing-but, once for all, I must de-&#xD;
cline standing your excuse any longer. I&#xD;
should think people could like each other in&#xD;
a reasonable manner, like each other without&#xD;
this continual jealousy; but if not-why,&#xD;
then they had better stop liking one another&#xD;
at all!"&#xD;
"Ah, lady fair, that may be even beyond&#xD;
your power," Julian 'answered, with a smile&#xD;
-for he thought her only a little more than&#xD;
usually hard to propitiate. "'Like each other&#xD;
m a reasonable manner? '-why, the very&#xD;
stones could afford to laugh at such a senti-&#xD;
ment from La belle des belle.,. When, in ull&#xD;
yoi~r life, did you ever find any one who liked&#xD;
you in a reasonable manner?"&#xD;
"I never found any one who liked me in&#xD;
quite such an unreasonable one as yourself,"&#xD;
she retorted.&#xD;
"Granted, with all my heart; for it only&#xD;
goes to prove that none have ever liked you&#xD;
half as well. You surely have not yet to learn&#xD;
that, 'to be wise in love, exceeds man's&#xD;
strength."'&#xD;
It was not the first time by many that he&#xD;
~ had used this word, and used it unrebuked,&#xD;
but now it seemed from some cause or other&#xD;
to jar on Valerie's mood; and her brow con-&#xD;
tracted as she said, coldly.&#xD;
"I confess I don't see the point of the&#xD;
quotation. Shakespeare is always right, of&#xD;
course; but we~ were not discussing either&#xD;
love or wisdom, that I am aware of."&#xD;
"Were we not?" he replied. "Well, per-&#xD;
haps I am very stupid, but I really thought&#xD;
we were. At least you arraigned me for&#xD;
faults having only that origin and that ex-&#xD;
cuse,"&#xD;
"Having no excuse at all then," said she,&#xD;
with increasing coldness, for she felt out of&#xD;
sorts that day, and very indifferent whether&#xD;
the crisis came or not.&#xD;
Julian started. Perhaps something in&#xD;
her manner warned him, for he glanced&#xD;
keenly into her face, and his tone greatly&#xD;
subdued itself when he said: "You are in&#xD;
the humor to be hard on me to-day~ I see.&#xD;
Well, I deserve every thing that you can say&#xD;
in the way of reproach: but I don't deserve&#xD;
wispicion. Blame every thing, doubt every&#xD;
thing-except my love."&#xD;
&#xD;
REAPING T]&#xD;
&#xD;
He did not mend matters by that; and&#xD;
so he 'felt, the moment after.&#xD;
"You forget yourself!" she cried, almost&#xD;
angrily; "and you forget a greatdeal besides.&#xD;
I cannot and will not listen to any thing&#xD;
more of this kind. Remember that-and&#xD;
don't force me to tell you so again!"&#xD;
Her tone was more peremptory than she&#xD;
had probably intended it to be, and was ill&#xD;
suited for her purpose, since' it woke the&#xD;
angry obstinacy never long sleeping in Rom-&#xD;
ney's nature. He looked at her steadily;&#xD;
and it was easy to see that the look promised&#xD;
no moderation.&#xD;
" You surely don't think that, after all&#xD;
that has passed, you can lay such a command&#xD;
on me?" he asked.&#xD;
"I think," she answered concisely, "that&#xD;
it will be your best policy to observe it."&#xD;
He laughed a little scornfully. "A man&#xD;
who feels as I do cares little for policy and&#xD;
less for penalties. Your worst may be as&#xD;
death to me, but nevertheless I shall dare it.&#xD;
I told you three weeks ago that this should&#xD;
end soon. I tell you to-day that it shall end&#xD;
-now. It remains only for you* to say&#xD;
how."&#xD;
"You had better not force me to say&#xD;
how," she answered, shrinking in spite of&#xD;
herself from the issue, now that it was at&#xD;
hand. "You had better, indeed, forget all&#xD;
of this. Ah, Julian, why will you not be&#xD;
content to let us remain pleasant friends&#xD;
without any of this weary recrimination?"&#xD;
"Friends?" he repeated; "that is non-&#xD;
sense! I told you once before that lam not,,&#xD;
an~l never will be, your friend. As for this&#xD;
'weary recrimination,' you are not more&#xD;
tired of it than I am. I have only failed to&#xD;
end it heretofore because-well, because I&#xD;
am the veriest coward alive, and I feared my&#xD;
fate too much. :Now, at least, I have a right&#xD;
to sit at your side and look in your eyes-I&#xD;
will forfeit even that if my tale is told to no&#xD;
purpose. For there is no middle ground for&#xD;
me, Valerie. Henceforward, I am either&#xD;
~your betrothed husband-or-your bitter&#xD;
~flemy~~~&#xD;
"Julian!&#xD;
She was sincerely startled now-and&#xD;
with good cause. It was no pretty page&#xD;
lisping a love-story, who stood before her,&#xD;
&#xD;
but a man in whom she had roused all of&#xD;
manhood's strongest passion. At that mo-&#xD;
ment, she would have given any thing to&#xD;
have been able to summon the gay badinage&#xD;
that had fenced off so many an awkward&#xD;
issue; but nothing came to her lips save&#xD;
once again that half-frightened, half-expostu-&#xD;
lating "Julian!"&#xD;
For once he paid no attention to her&#xD;
voice. N~t a line of his face altered-the&#xD;
face that had suddenly hardened into unac-&#xD;
customed resolve-and his eyes had lost all&#xD;
their dreamy beauty, as he stood looking&#xD;
down on her.&#xD;
"Well, which is it?" he asked, hoarsely.&#xD;
"Julian, you-you frighten me!" she&#xD;
cried. "Which is what!"&#xD;
"Don't tell me you don't ~ he said,&#xD;
passionately. "Don't tell me that at this&#xD;
late day, I have to begin and say to you in&#xD;
due form that I loved you from the moment&#xD;
I saw you first, and shall love you till I die.&#xD;
It is for you to say whether, that love shall&#xD;
be God's blessing or the devil's curse!"&#xD;
"Julian, pray hush !-pray forget this!"&#xD;
"Forget it! He gave a short, hard&#xD;
laugh. "It is like 'a woman' to say that.&#xD;
Forget it! As if your sign-manual is ever&#xD;
forgotten! As if I shall not carry your&#xD;
mark, for good or evil, to my dying day! It&#xD;
is a fine thing to draw men on and bid them&#xD;
hope, by every art in your power-then,&#xD;
when they grow too earnest to amuse you,&#xD;
coolly say, 'Forget It.' But have you never&#xD;
thought what that forgetting means?"&#xD;
She glanced up at him mutely. No, she&#xD;
had never thought-that much, at least, can&#xD;
be said for her. She had never once con-&#xD;
sidered. It was all merely amusement with&#xD;
her; and she had scarcely ever dreamed&#xD;
that it was other with them-until now.&#xD;
N~ wonder that for once, face to face with&#xD;
'the truth, her cheek grew pale.&#xD;
"Juhian," she whispered, "for Heaven's&#xD;
sake, let there be an end of this! I may&#xD;
have been to blame, ~but see-I ask your&#xD;
pardon so humbly. Indeed, meyer dreamed&#xD;
hut that you, too, were amusing yourself in&#xD;
a pleasant way. Indeed, I never dreamed-"&#xD;
She stopped short, for with one quick&#xD;
step he had reached her side and grasped&#xD;
her arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
tIE HARVEST.                        11~.&#xD;
"Hush!" he said, sternly. "All this is&#xD;
folly, and you ought to know it. Amusing&#xD;
myself! :No, you never thought that. You&#xD;
knew only too well that you were playing&#xD;
at life and death with me. But-it is not&#xD;
too late yet. For God'8 sake, pause! Stop&#xD;
-think! N'o man on this earth ever loved&#xD;
you half as well as I do-will not even that&#xD;
love win something in return? Have you&#xD;
no woman's heart in your breast~? Can you&#xD;
not even tolerate me enough to marry me?&#xD;
I would try so hard, that I would force you&#xD;
to love me after a while. Valerie, I never&#xD;
thought to sink so low! I never thought to&#xD;
say to any woman what I say to you now-&#xD;
Have pity on me!"&#xD;
Ab, that is right. Veil your face from&#xD;
those beseeching eyes! Shut out from your&#xD;
ears those pleading tones! But you can&#xD;
never banish the voice that says over and&#xD;
over, "Behold your work." And silence in&#xD;
itself is a wrong; so, after a moment, she&#xD;
raised her face, pale and calm, but resolved.&#xD;
"I dare not deceive you," she said, sad-&#xD;
ly. "There never has been, there never can&#xD;
be, the least hope for you. I don't defend&#xD;
my conduct toward you-for I suppose you&#xD;
will think it no justification to repeat once&#xD;
more that I had no such intention as this-&#xD;
and if you will not grant me your forgive-&#xD;
ness, there is nothing left for me but to bear&#xD;
my burden of self-reproach as best I can. I&#xD;
would like it very much, though, if youoould&#xD;
say once-only once-that you forgive me."&#xD;
She looked at him' wistfully; but there&#xD;
was little hope of generosity or pardon in&#xD;
those eyes so full of bitter anger.&#xD;
"I feel more inclined to curse you,&#xD;
when I think of all that lies before me," he&#xD;
said. "But then one should not violate the&#xD;
l~den&amp;amp;~ances so far as that-at least in a lady's&#xD;
presence. No, I shall never forgive you&#xD;
while I live-for you can' never even ima-&#xD;
gine the full breadth and depth of the disap-&#xD;
pointment you have dealt me this day.&#xD;
Whenever you think of it, only remember&#xD;
this-that I do not blow out my brains,&#xD;
simply because I hope yet to see you suffer&#xD;
[n part at least as I am suffering now!"&#xD;
With those words-words the bitterness&#xD;
~f whichmade her shudder as if a cold hand&#xD;
~ad been laid upon her-he dropped the&#xD;

arm which up to that moment he had sti&#xD;
lightly held, and left the room without or&#xD;
backward glance.&#xD;
An hour or two later, there came&#xD;
knock at Valerie's door, and when si&#xD;
opened it Madame Vacquant stood on tli&#xD;
threshold. There was no perceptible chan~&#xD;
in the perfect discipline of the beautify&#xD;
features, but the eyes had proved harder t&#xD;
tutor, and in them was a look which migl~&#xD;
have warned Miss Aylmer of what was cOn&#xD;
ing, if she had needed any warning. Th&#xD;
soft voice, however, sounded quite as usm&#xD;
when it said:&#xD;
"May I come in? I will not occup&#xD;
you more than n minute, but I have some&#xD;
thing of importance to say to you."&#xD;
"Come in, of course," Valerie answered&#xD;
"I beg pardon for not speaking, but I wa&#xD;
not expecting to see you, and-"&#xD;
"The sight of me surprised you. VerI&#xD;
naturally, I am sure. Certainly the las&#xD;
person whom you might reasonably hav(&#xD;
expected to see was myself. But I hope yoi&#xD;
will believe that I only come because I fee:&#xD;
it my duty to do so."&#xD;
"Yes," Valerie said, a little stiffly-and&#xD;
then she drew forward a chair, adding,&#xD;
"Will you not sit down?"&#xD;
The other shook her head. "I shall only&#xD;
remain a ~ she repeated, and she&#xD;
continued standing, one hand resting on the&#xD;
top of a table which occupied the centre of&#xD;
the floor. Of course, Valerie stood also,&#xD;
with her head somewhat haughtily erect, as&#xD;
if yet uncertain what that word "duty -&#xD;
always an ominous word on the lips of cer-&#xD;
tain peopl~-might portend. Neither was&#xD;
she long left in doubt. Almost without&#xD;
hesitation, Madame Vacquant spoke-clear-&#xD;
ly and calmly, though somewhat formal-&#xD;
ly:&#xD;
"I have just left my son. He tells me&#xD;
what I can scarcely belie~e-that you have&#xD;
rejected him. Witnessing, as I have done,&#xD;
your uniform encouragement of his suit, I&#xD;
have no alternative but to think that he&#xD;
must be mistaken. I cannot, but believe&#xD;
that he has interpreted some rebuke or dis-&#xD;
agreement in a morbid spirit. If you could&#xD;
see him, you would not wonder that I come&#xD;
to ask you who is right-he or I."&#xD;
&#xD;
ill   Now, long before this, Miss Aylmer was&#xD;
ie herself again, and not likely to blench before&#xD;
Julian's mother, as she had done to Julian's&#xD;
a self. So her answer was made with becom-&#xD;
to ing respect, but very decidedly.&#xD;
te "I am sorry to say, madame, that it is he&#xD;
~e who is right. He did me the honor to&#xD;
il offer me his hand, and I was compelled to&#xD;
o decline it. There was no misinterpretation&#xD;
tt possible, and, much as I regret every thing&#xD;
connected with the matter, I cannot wish&#xD;
e that there should be."&#xD;
tl It was well that she was so brave, for&#xD;
there was much in the eye steadily regard-&#xD;
y ing her that would not have been pleasant&#xD;
to weak nerves; and through the silvery&#xD;
voice there rang a tone of\menace when it&#xD;
spoke again-softening toward the last,&#xD;
s however, into appeal:&#xD;
"Are you in earnest in this? Are you&#xD;
~ sure that no anger or pique is influencing&#xD;
you, instead of deliberate resolve? Julian's&#xD;
temper is, I know, trying; but I can prom-&#xD;
ise you any concession or submission on his&#xD;
I part that you choose to ask. See I-I am&#xD;
his mother, and, for his sake, I am willing to&#xD;
do any thing to secure his happiness. Give&#xD;
me one word of hope to take back to him,&#xD;
and all this shall be forgotten."&#xD;
"Madame," said Valerie, kindly, "trust&#xD;
me it is you who misinterpret now. And&#xD;
you ask me to do your son a great wrong.&#xD;
I desire neither concession nor submission on&#xD;
his part; and to give him hope would be to&#xD;
deceive him. I cannot do that."&#xD;
She spoke with profound consideration&#xD;
and gentleness; but, for the first time in her&#xD;
lifeshe saw passion flash into the face be-&#xD;
fore her, and passion quivered in the tones&#xD;
which answered almost vehemently:&#xD;
"You mean, then, that you intend to put&#xD;
his love and his life down under your foot?&#xD;
You mean that you have drawn him on by&#xD;
every art in your power only for this heart-&#xD;
less triumph? You mean that you fling him&#xD;
out of your path to go to destruction, as he&#xD;
surely will, and that this-this decision is&#xD;
final?"&#xD;
Miss Aylmer drew back, coldly. "We&#xD;
need not argue whether you are right or&#xD;
wrong in your reproaches," she said. "I do&#xD;
not resent them, because you are suffering&#xD;
&#xD;
through me; but I do repeat that this decis-&#xD;
ion is final."&#xD;
"That you will not change it?"&#xD;
"That it is not possible for me to change&#xD;
They looked at each other steadily for a&#xD;
moment. If Madame Vacquant wished to&#xD;
read her chances of failure or success, a very&#xD;
bitter realization of the former must have&#xD;
come over her at sight of the resolution ap-&#xD;
parent in Valerie's eyes. Certainly when&#xD;
she spoke again, all the late passion and ap-&#xD;
peal had died out of her voice, and it was&#xD;
now only measured and chill.&#xD;
"I see, indeed, that I have misinterpreted&#xD;
you greatly. For one thing, I fancied my-&#xD;
self addressing a woman-not a coquette,&#xD;
without the ordinary impulses of humanity&#xD;
that temper the worst of coquetry. It&#xD;
seemed to me that the part you have played&#xD;
was too pitilessly cruel for belief. And it is&#xD;
hard, very hard, that I should learn my mis-&#xD;
take too late. If I had only dreamed of this&#xD;
a little earlier, I might have interfered at&#xD;
any cost. I might have sent Julian away-&#xD;
anywhere! No fate could have been worse&#xD;
than this! "&#xD;
"I hope and trust that you are mis-&#xD;
taken," Valerie said. "This can be only a&#xD;
boy's disappointment. Before long, I will,&#xD;
&#xD;
FIE HARVEST.                       119&#xD;
go out of his life, and he wrn forget me&#xD;
quite."&#xD;
"You say so because you know nothing&#xD;
of him," his mother answered, with a grand&#xD;
sort of scorn. "How should you, indeed?&#xD;
He has been to you only a toy, and we do&#xD;
not study our toys very deeply. But you&#xD;
are wrong. This has been the sport of afew&#xD;
weeks to you-it will be a lifelong curse to&#xD;
him. Remember this, I beg. Remember,&#xD;
when you go on to act the same story over&#xD;
again, that you have left at least one&#xD;
wrecked life in your path. However, I need&#xD;
speak of him no more; if you have decided,&#xD;
all is said. I should like now to speak of&#xD;
yourself. Has it never occurred to you&#xD;
that, for your own sake, you would do&#xD;
well to pause in this matter, before it is&#xD;
too late?"&#xD;
Full of astonishment, the dark eyes&#xD;
looked at her. "For my own sake, madame?&#xD;
I confess I don't understand you."&#xD;
Still less did she understand the cold&#xD;
smile that came round the pale thin lips, or&#xD;
the cold tone that answered:&#xD;
"If any thing whatever lies very near&#xD;
your heart, pray that you never may under-&#xD;
stand-that is all."&#xD;
She turned and walked slowly from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;

SIR ARTEGALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
SIR ARTEGALL.&#xD;
IT was nearly a month after Romney had&#xD;
put his fate to the toWch, and lost it all, that&#xD;
Alix said to Darcy when they chanced to be&#xD;
alone in the library one morning:&#xD;
"I fancied I saw Mr. Romney's face at&#xD;
oi~e of the club-house windows this morn-&#xD;
ing, as I was coming home from early mass;&#xD;
but I suppose it must have been a mistake.&#xD;
He is not in the city, is he?"&#xD;
She asked the question carelessly and&#xD;
simply, but was instantly struck with the ex-&#xD;
pression which it brought to Maurice's face.&#xD;
He even hesitated a moment before answer-&#xD;
ing:&#xD;
"You are sure it was his face? You&#xD;
may have been mistaken."&#xD;
"No, I am not sure at all," she replied.&#xD;
"But I thought I recognized him, and-and&#xD;
I was glad Valerie was not with me."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Because he looked so strangely and so.&#xD;
badly, that it would have made her feel&#xD;
wretchedly. She suffers very much about&#xD;
him now."&#xD;
Her companion smiled.&#xD;
"You are so thoroughly illogical in your&#xD;
sympathy!" he said. "Does it never strike&#xD;
you that Miss Aylmer's sufferings-grant-&#xD;
ing that she does suffer-are hardly so much&#xD;
to be pitied as those she has caused?"&#xD;
"No," said Alix, stoutly. "On the&#xD;
contrary, it strikes me as far from just to&#xD;
&#xD;
make Valerie accountable for the absurd&#xD;
conduct of a man who chose to fall in love&#xD;
with her and get rejected-as of course we&#xD;
all know Mr. Romney has been."&#xD;
"BuLsuppose the falling in love was as&#xD;
much her work as the rejection?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I shall not suppose any thing&#xD;
of the kind."&#xD;
"Then you must obstinately shut your&#xD;
eyes to the plainest possible state of facts."&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
"I mean that I have seen a good deal of&#xD;
latter-day flirtation and coquetry in my life;&#xD;
but that I never saw any thing to equal the&#xD;
remorseless science with which your friend&#xD;
led that poor boy on to the end, which every&#xD;
one but himself foresaw."&#xD;
"I know very little about it," said Alix,&#xD;
with a puzzled look; "for Valerie has never&#xD;
mentioned Mr. Ilomney~s name to me since&#xD;
he went away a month ago. But I can see&#xD;
that she suffers-you could see it too, if you&#xD;
chose to look; and I don't believe that she&#xD;
ever meant any harm to him."&#xD;
Darcy's lip curled in a sort of cold scorn.&#xD;
*   "I have no doubt she told him so," he&#xD;
said; "but we judge deeds rather by result&#xD;
than by intention; that is, even if some of&#xD;
us could imitate your charity with regard to&#xD;
the latter."&#xD;
"You mean that you think she deliber-&#xD;
ately broke his heart for mere pastime?"&#xD;
He looked smilingly into the flushed, in-&#xD;
dignant face before him. "Why do you want&#xD;
me to say what you are sure to resent?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Because I want to know if you are real-&#xD;
ly so unjust."&#xD;
"Then I really am so unjust, as you con-&#xD;
aider it. I hold Miss Aylmer guilty of all&#xD;
that Romney has suffered, and still suffers;&#xD;
shnply because she inflicted every pang gra-&#xD;
tuitously for her own amusement."&#xD;
"I think I could convince you "-Alix&#xD;
began warmly, when a hand fell lightly on&#xD;
her shoulder, and a clear, quiet voice startled&#xD;
them both by speaking:&#xD;
"Never waste exertion, mignonne. How&#xD;
often must I tell you that? Captain Darcy's&#xD;
mind is thoroughly made up on this point,&#xD;
and you could not change it if you spoke a&#xD;
volume. So I beg you will not speak a word&#xD;
-in my behalf."&#xD;
Darcy started, and turned. Alix was&#xD;
seated at the table, drawing, and he had&#xD;
been standing by her side sharpening one by&#xD;
one her pencils; so they had neither of them&#xD;
caught Miss Aylmer's soft tread as she&#xD;
crossed the thick carpet; and he was quite&#xD;
unconscious how much or how little of their&#xD;
conversation had been overheard. The doubt&#xD;
did not disquiet him outwardly, however;&#xD;
for there was no sign of confusion in his face&#xD;
when he met her eyes, although, before he&#xD;
could say any thing, she spoke abruptly:&#xD;
"I am sure you think there was never a&#xD;
better exemplification of the old proverb&#xD;
about listeners; but I ought to apologize.&#xD;
I was reading in that recess yonder when&#xD;
you both came in, and I did not think it&#xD;
necessary to speak. Your conversation was&#xD;
very harmless for a while, you know, and&#xD;
after that-well, perhaps I might have inter-&#xD;
fered; but then it is not often that one has&#xD;
the opportunity of accompanying a friend,&#xD;
or acquaintance, into the palace of Truth, to&#xD;
hear what is thought of them, as I have&#xD;
done. The temptation must excuse me."&#xD;
"You have heard every thing, then?"&#xD;
"Every thing."&#xD;
"I am glad of that," he said, somewhat&#xD;
to her surprise. "You are aware, then, how&#xD;
I was betrayed into expressing an opinion on&#xD;
a matter which assuredly does not concern&#xD;
me; and about which, consequently, I should&#xD;
not have spoken, if Miss Rivi~re's questions&#xD;
had not demanded answers."&#xD;
"Yes, I am perfectly aware of the cir-&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
cumstances, and entirely excuse you," she&#xD;
answered. "Don't fancy that I am either&#xD;
surprised or hurt. I have known all along&#xD;
what your opinion of me was, and I believe&#xD;
you don't change your judgment."&#xD;
"Not certainly without good cause."&#xD;
"I never did you the injustice to think&#xD;
so, or to imagine for a moment.that the con-&#xD;
sideration of human weakness or human&#xD;
frailty would weigh a feather's weight in&#xD;
your decision. But perhaps even you may&#xD;
yet live to learn that justice-mere justice-&#xD;
is the most hard, welinigh the most cruel&#xD;
thing on earth."&#xD;
To Alix, merely looking on, it was strange&#xD;
to hear the suppressed passion in Valerie's&#xD;
voice, and yet more strange to see how she&#xD;
and Darcy seemed to understand each other&#xD;
-how his face settled sternly at her last&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"It is all that we need ask," he said.&#xD;
"God help us then! Yes, God help even&#xD;
you, if; at the last He deal not mer~y, but&#xD;
justice 1-if, like you, He looks not to inten-&#xD;
tions, but to results."&#xD;
"I have never knowingly wronged or&#xD;
pained a creature of His making," he an-&#xD;
swered, coldly. "I am ready-even for&#xD;
justice."&#xD;
"So, no doubt, the Pharisee thought,&#xD;
when, standing apart, he thanked God that&#xD;
he was not as other men."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," ho said. "But&#xD;
then, when have you not mistaken me? I&#xD;
have both sins and errors enough to answer&#xD;
for; but I trust they affect only myself. I&#xD;
cannot help thinking that many wrongs done&#xD;
thus, will not count so heavily in the last&#xD;
reckoning, as one wrought against another."&#xD;
"But how if that wrong was not know-&#xD;
ingly wrought?"&#xD;
He looked at her intently for a moment,&#xD;
and then answered, still coldly:&#xD;
"I am not a theologian, Miss Aylmer;&#xD;
and that is a question for priests. They will&#xD;
tell you much of 'intention;~ but I am a'&#xD;
plain man, and I prefer to look at results."&#xD;
"Yes, so you said before. I should have&#xD;
remembered it."&#xD;
She had spoken from the first in a&#xD;
low, quiet voice, and now she ceased al~-&#xD;
ruptly. They were all three silent for&#xD;

122                       VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
SIR ARTEGALL.                         123&#xD;
&#xD;
a moment, during which they made quit&#xD;
a striking picture-a picture which woul~&#xD;
not have failed to please Darcy's eye if h&#xD;
could have seen it as an outsider, and migh&#xD;
have afforded him a study for some scene fa&#xD;
more dramatic than the simple one the~&#xD;
were enacting. Perhaps it was the under&#xD;
lying earnestness, which had not escaped ii&#xD;
word or tone, that thus unconsciously t&#xD;
themselves asserted itself in attitude; but ai&#xD;
least their grouping was singularly express&#xD;
sive. Surprise and concern were shown ft&#xD;
every line of Alix's face, as she looked uj&#xD;
from the shadow of her capacious chair and&#xD;
heavy mournIng draperies; the poor, little&#xD;
pale face that had only its wistful eyes and&#xD;
sun-tinted hair to give it beauty now. But&#xD;
neither of the others heeded her. Tall and&#xD;
straight, Darcy stood by the table, almost as&#xD;
if he had braced himself to resist some dan-&#xD;
ger, or defy some temptation, the knowledge&#xD;
of which hardened the pleasant face, and&#xD;
brought into the genial eyes their look of&#xD;
coldness. He, too, was somewhat iii the&#xD;
shade; but Valerie stood farther forward,&#xD;
and on her the whole light of the picture fell&#xD;
-as if it loved to seek out and dwell upon a&#xD;
thing so lovely. The dark oaken panels be-&#xD;
hind her threw into full relief the richness&#xD;
of tint for which her beauty was so remark-&#xD;
able, from the topmost braid of hair which&#xD;
caught the light on its polished surface, down&#xD;
to the last violet fold of the dress that swept&#xD;
the carpet. She was paler than usual-there&#xD;
was no doubt that the bright cheek hiid lost&#xD;
much of its color during the last month-&#xD;
but she had never looked more beautiful or&#xD;
more proud. When she spoke again, how-&#xD;
ever, there was only gravity in her voice.&#xD;
"You did not tell Alix, Captain Darcy-&#xD;
will you please tell me, whether Julian is in&#xD;
the city?"&#xD;
"Yes," Darcy answered, as gravely as&#xD;
herself. "lie is here. He has been here&#xD;
for a week, I believe."&#xD;
"And why have you not tried to induce&#xD;
him to come 2home?"&#xD;
"I should suppose you might be aware&#xD;
that no oue is less likely to possess any in-&#xD;
fluence with him than myself."&#xD;
"Still, you might have tried."&#xD;
"I did try-without effect."&#xD;
&#xD;
e     "And does his mother know this?"&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
e     "That I cannot tell; but I heard her say&#xD;
t yesterday that he was still absent."&#xD;
r "But what is he doing here, that he&#xD;
~ should adopt this secrecy?"&#xD;
She asked the question eagerly, almost&#xD;
1 ~passionately, but waited vainly for an an-&#xD;
swer. None came. No sound broke the&#xD;
L silence, save the quick, steady strokes with&#xD;
which Darcy was sharpening Alix's pencil.&#xD;
Then, instead of repeating her inquiry, Vale-&#xD;
rie bent down and whispered a word or two&#xD;
I in the latter's ear. Their tenor was at&#xD;
once apparent, for Miss Rivi~re rose and&#xD;
left the room. While Darcy was still look-&#xD;
ing after her, Valerie spoke.&#xD;
* "I have sent Alix away, because I wish&#xD;
to speak to you on this subject, more freely&#xD;
than I could before he5 for she knows little&#xD;
or nothing of Julian's weakness. I asked&#xD;
you a moment ago what he is doing here,&#xD;
and your silence is answer enough. I ask&#xD;
you now if you will make an effort to bring&#xD;
him back to his senses?"&#xD;
"I would willingly do so," Darcy an-&#xD;
swered, "if I could flatter myself that there&#xD;
was the least likelihood of success. But I&#xD;
know that there is not."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
She asked this sharply, and he looked up&#xD;
in some surprise.&#xD;
"I should think you would scarcely need&#xD;
to inquire.'&#xD;
"Is it my presence that keeps him&#xD;
away?"&#xD;
"I can only presume so."&#xD;
She was silent for several minutes, clasp-&#xD;
ing her hands over the back of the chair, and&#xD;
looking down on them with a strangely-set&#xD;
and bitter expression-her brows knitted,&#xD;
and her lips compressed. But when at last&#xD;
she looked up, he saw that she had arrived&#xD;
at some determination.&#xD;
"Then I will not be here a day longer&#xD;
than I can help," she said. "I will write&#xD;
to papa, and as soon as he can come for me,&#xD;
I shall leave.-I hope forever. But, in the&#xD;
mean while, for this will take time, I must&#xD;
do something. You are the last person in&#xD;
the world on whom I have any claim for&#xD;
service, or of whom I would like to ask a&#xD;
&#xD;
favor. Yet it is part of my hard punish-&#xD;
ment that I am now forced to ask both&#xD;
service and favor of you."&#xD;
She paused a moment, and he began to&#xD;
speak, but she interrupted him:&#xD;
"No. Please don't make any protesta-&#xD;
t~ons. It would be rather late for those-&#xD;
between U8. I have no doubt you will do&#xD;
what I ask you without demur or grudging.&#xD;
But it is none the less hard to ask it. In&#xD;
one word, you will deliver a note to Julian,&#xD;
and add your entreaties to mine that he will&#xD;
come home?"&#xD;
"I will deliver the note certainly," Darcy&#xD;
answered; "but, as for the entreaties, you&#xD;
must allow me to assure you that they will&#xD;
be useless."&#xD;
"Even mine?"&#xD;
He looked at her steadily.&#xD;
"Unless there be something more than&#xD;
entreaty offered, even yours."&#xD;
"You mean-?"&#xD;
"I mean that Julian is not likely to re-&#xD;
turn, save as your accepted lover."&#xD;
The blood rushed over her face in a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Then he will not return," she said,&#xD;
haughtily. "But-" and her tone changed&#xD;
and softened-" I must do something. I&#xD;
must at least attempt to move him I Surely,&#xD;
Captain Darcy, you do not think it would be&#xD;
utterly useless?"&#xD;
He certainly did think so, but the eyes&#xD;
that looked at him were so full of pathetic&#xD;
appeal that, for once, something like com-&#xD;
passion even for her crept into his heart,&#xD;
and he compromised with the truth.&#xD;
"It can do no harm," he answered.&#xD;
"That is all I can say."&#xD;
"That is enough," she answered. She&#xD;
sat down in Alix's vacated seat and drew&#xD;
toward her paper, pen, and ink. It did&#xD;
not take her more than a minute to dash off&#xD;
a few lines and push them toward Darcy,&#xD;
saying, "Will that do?"&#xD;
"Do you mean itie to read it?" he asked,&#xD;
in surprise.&#xD;
"Yes," she said. "Why not? If I had&#xD;
needed any proof that the whole circum-&#xD;
stances of the case were known to you, your&#xD;
strictures of this morning would have given&#xD;
it."&#xD;
&#xD;
After that, there was nothing for him&#xD;
but to take up the paper and read what she&#xD;
had written. It was only a short appeal to&#xD;
the wayward heart she had cause to know&#xD;
so well-an appeal chiefly to its own gener-&#xD;
osity, but so well and delicately expressed,&#xD;
avoiding with such fine tact too much and&#xD;
too little allusion to the past, that Darcy was&#xD;
fully justified in his commendation. "This&#xD;
will certainly move him if any thing can,"&#xD;
he said, cordially.&#xD;
She looked up wistfully.&#xD;
"If any thing can! You say that in a&#xD;
tone of very grave doubt."&#xD;
"I cannot help feeling very grave doubt,"&#xD;
he answered. "lie has not-of course I&#xD;
need scarcely say that-mentioned your&#xD;
name to me; but he is very far from being&#xD;
eien his usual self."&#xD;
"How is he changed?"&#xD;
"Perhaps you can imagine-at least I&#xD;
cannot well describe the change."&#xD;
"Yes," she said, in a low whisper, "I&#xD;
can imagine." Then she was silent for a&#xD;
moment, until at last, looking up at him, she&#xD;
murmured, "And you too think it is all my&#xD;
work?"&#xD;
"I acquit you this fai'," he answered,&#xD;
"that you did not comprehend the inflam-&#xD;
mable material with. which you dealt. No&#xD;
doubt you have often made this experiment&#xD;
with less disastrous results. You were un-&#xD;
fortunate in your subject this time, that is&#xD;
alL"&#xD;
"You are mistaken," she said, in a low&#xD;
voice. "But that is where you wrong me&#xD;
so deeply that I suppose I need scarcely at-&#xD;
tempt a word of justification. I never in all&#xD;
my life made any experiment in the way&#xD;
you mean. I may have been careless and&#xD;
thoughtless sometimes-youth lovespleasure,&#xD;
and woman loves admiration-but I never&#xD;
knowingly injured any one. However, that&#xD;
is not to the point at all. You promise me&#xD;
that you will see Julian, and deliver this&#xD;
note?"&#xD;
"Yes," he said. "I promise to bring&#xD;
you an answer in the course of a few hours."&#xD;
"And-may I give you one caution ?-.&#xD;
Please urge him to return; and do it kindly,&#xD;
Don't be hard on him."&#xD;
"You think me likely to be so?"&#xD;

it this morning, saying that he had not don&#xD;
o before, because he was uncertain of papa&#xD;
consent, and did not care to raise my hope&#xD;
without some secure foundation. I hard~&#xD;
ought myself that papa would accept; bu&#xD;
he has done so."&#xD;
"And I should have been sure that h&#xD;
would. Why not, indeed? There are me:&#xD;
who would give half their lives for an assure&#xD;
independence out of this wretched country&#xD;
And, as for breaking ties, or leaving friend&#xD;
-I believe those are the usual objections ti&#xD;
going abroad-a mightier Hand has already:&#xD;
done that for him. He could not stan(&#xD;
among the ruins of Thebes more alien fron&#xD;
his past life and past hopes than he stand&#xD;
here to-day."&#xD;
"Yes," she said, sadly; "and so it ma~&#xD;
be best. While as for me-"&#xD;
"As for you, there is a glorious vision of&#xD;
Music that beckons you with shining eyes&#xD;
and outstretched arms across the ocean."&#xD;
She shook her head mournfully. "~To~&#xD;
All that is over for me now-and I don'l&#xD;
think it will ever return. I am anxious tc&#xD;
resume my studies, but it is with none ol&#xD;
the old love-rather with a heavy conscious-&#xD;
ness of toil. ~ must work; for my future&#xD;
support may depend upon my own exertions.&#xD;
But it is only work. It has ceased to be&#xD;
delight."&#xD;
"You are not yourself now, Alix ;you&#xD;
are morbid in your view of your future as&#xD;
well as of your present life. This will pass&#xD;
away after a time, and the old allegiance&#xD;
will return."&#xD;
"I scarcely think so," she said, slowly.&#xD;
"A spring seems broken within me. After&#xD;
a while I may learn to take interest and feel&#xD;
pleasure in the art again; but the full glory&#xD;
of its worship can never return. Th~ old&#xD;
love-the old beauty-ah, they are buried&#xD;
in gravel"&#xD;
voice ceased, choked by tears. And&#xD;
alth gh Valerie knew that she was mis-&#xD;
taken-although she was sure that her art&#xD;
would soon claim all its former devotion-&#xD;
she could not say so. She could only smooth&#xD;
back the bright hair, and murmur softly the&#xD;
grand old words that ha~re given strength&#xD;
and courage to many a failing heart since&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Lt they first fell from the inspired pen of that&#xD;
e poor monk whom millions upon millions have&#xD;
risen up and declared blessed-" He who&#xD;
s best knows how to endure, shall possess the&#xD;
y greater peace!"&#xD;
it Then she went back to her toilet; and&#xD;
when it was completed hurried down-stairs&#xD;
o without further delay. Pierre was loitering&#xD;
a in the lower hall, and she paused a moment&#xD;
~ to ask if Darcy had yet come in-hoping al-&#xD;
most against hope for an affirmative reply-&#xD;
s but he answered at once in the negative,&#xD;
c and, with a sigh, she went on into the draw-&#xD;
~ ing-room. Strange to say, although it was&#xD;
I growing quite late, Madame Vacquant was&#xD;
i not there. The sumptuous rooms were all&#xD;
s ablaze with gas, but profoundly silent, and&#xD;
wholly empty, the chairs and sofas, the tall&#xD;
mirrors and gleaming statues having all the&#xD;
light and warmth and bright luxury to&#xD;
themselves. To and fro Valerie wandered,&#xD;
in restless impatience, anxious to be gone&#xD;
only because waiting was tiresome, and be-&#xD;
* cause of a wholly illogical feeling that the&#xD;
sooner they left, the sooner it might be pos-&#xD;
sible to return, yet dreading very much the&#xD;
evening before her. She dreaded every&#xD;
- thing now that connected her with Madame&#xD;
Vacquant, and, as society pr5eminently did&#xD;
this, she had begun. to dislike society. As&#xD;
she sauntered aimlessly back and forth, all&#xD;
unheeding the lovely reflection which mir-.&#xD;
ror after mirror gave, she yawned wearily&#xD;
in anticipation of her coming 'boredom;&#xD;
then she looked at her watchand wondered&#xD;
how much longer Madame Vacquant would&#xD;
be, and finally she went to the window,&#xD;
drawing back the heavy silken curtains, and&#xD;
looking out on the gathering night and&#xD;
misty rain. Almost unconsciously she shiv-&#xD;
ered, then turned away, and sauntered back&#xD;
toward the music-room. She sat down to&#xD;
the piano, but she had not played six bars&#xD;
before she rose again, and again looked at&#xD;
her watch. Surely it was strange that&#xD;
Madame Vacquant still did not come! Per-&#xD;
haps she was iu her sitting-room. It was&#xD;
foolish of her not to have thought of that&#xD;
before, and not to have gone 'there. She&#xD;
had not often entered this room during the&#xD;
past month, and had been averse to doingso&#xD;
even when it was necessary; but now mi-&#xD;

&#xD;
patience mastered every other feeling, anc&#xD;
she turned in that direction. Although form&#xD;
ing no part of the reception-suite, this apart&#xD;
ment was connected with them, so she had&#xD;
not far to go. She passed hastily through&#xD;
the different rooms, until she came to the&#xD;
one in question. The door was closed, but&#xD;
her hand was on the lock when suddenly a&#xD;
sound fell on her ear that made her pause&#xD;
-the sound of voices speaking.&#xD;
Not ordinary voices in ordinary conver-&#xD;
sation. Even through the heavy oakenpan-&#xD;
els there came, sufficiently audible, the quick&#xD;
tones of impatience, and the deeper accents&#xD;
of anger. The speakers were plainly only&#xD;
two, but they spoke so fast and eagerly that&#xD;
before a minute had elapsed Valerie knew&#xD;
that she stood with only a partition between&#xD;
herself 'and the man she had rejected-that&#xD;
Julian Romney was with his mother.&#xD;
He had come home, then 1 That was the&#xD;
first thought which flashed 'across her with&#xD;
a feeling of intense relief-relief scarcely&#xD;
tempered by the realization it was no happy&#xD;
or even peaceful interview from which that&#xD;
door separated her. Plainly there was bitter&#xD;
strife of words between the mother and son&#xD;
-none the less bitter because restrained by&#xD;
the former at least within due moderation&#xD;
of speech. Involuntarily, on realizing this,&#xD;
Valerie turned away; but as she did so,&#xD;
Julian raised his voice from its low key, and&#xD;
her own name fell on her ear, coupled with&#xD;
another which made her start in uncontrol-&#xD;
lable surprise, for it was not the name of&#xD;
the man whom Julian might have been sup-&#xD;
posed to mention, but of the loyal-hearted&#xD;
lover whoi~ she had left in far Louisiana-&#xD;
not of'Maurice Darcy, but of Charles Hau-&#xD;
taine!&#xD;
She had turned awe~y involuntarily;&#xD;
now, involuntarily, she paused, but it was&#xD;
only for a moment. She heard Madame&#xD;
Vacquant utter a few words which were&#xD;
evidently a question; and then, instead of&#xD;
waiting for the answer that would have told&#xD;
her all, she fled swiftly and eagerly-fled as&#xD;
if from some sudden temptation, and never&#xD;
paused until she found herself standing.&#xD;
breathless by the same window from which&#xD;
she had gazed inlistless impatience so short-&#xD;
ly before.&#xD;
&#xD;
Then she could not avoid asking herself&#xD;
* what could be.the meaning of this strange&#xD;
* knowledge of Hautaine by one to whom, she&#xD;
I had never uttered his name-nay, more,&#xD;
this strange knowledge of his claim upon her,&#xD;
the claim which the more engrossing in-&#xD;
terests of these past months had almost&#xD;
swept from her recollection. Now she&#xD;
waked with a start to the remembrance&#xD;
that her word was indeed staring her in the&#xD;
face-that the~ six months of her promise&#xD;
would finish their course within the next&#xD;
few weeks. She stopped a moment, and&#xD;
put her hand to her head in bewildered sur-&#xD;
prise. Could it really be so? Had time&#xD;
slipped away so fast, and brought her for-&#xD;
ward-only for this? She had given her&#xD;
promise to Hautaine in October, and this&#xD;
was the last of March. Yes; in a short&#xD;
time, the bond was due. In a shqrt time,&#xD;
Hautaine might come-and would he not&#xD;
come-to claim his promised answer, his&#xD;
promised reward for long and patient wait-&#xD;
ing? She knew that he had been in Eu-&#xD;
rope for many months, but-a stir, a, fra-&#xD;
grance, and Madame Vacquant's silken robes&#xD;
swept into sight.&#xD;
"So you are down," she said, with a lit-&#xD;
tle start. "I am sorry to have kept you&#xD;
waiting; but your grandfather detained me&#xD;
so long from my toilet, and RQse was so&#xD;
stupid about my hair, that I could not help&#xD;
it. Shallwe~onow?"&#xD;
"It is quite time," Valerie answered.&#xD;
For her life, she could not have said any&#xD;
thing more with that face fronting her-fal-&#xD;
sifying, as it were, the testimony of her own&#xD;
ears, and those musical tones still vibrating&#xD;
on the air. At that moment, Pierre an-&#xD;
nounced the carriage, and they went down-&#xD;
stairs. In the hall Valerie found time to&#xD;
say a few words to him, which she flattered&#xD;
herself were unheard:&#xD;
"Tell Captain Darcy that I will be back&#xD;
early, and ask him to wait for me in the&#xD;
library."&#xD;
Then she hurried after Madame Vac-&#xD;
quant, and they were hastily driven away.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
BADEGUNDE.&#xD;
Tnz clock on the library mantel rang&#xD;
out with its clear, silvery voice the single&#xD;
stroke of one, as Maurice Darcy looked up&#xD;
from a letter that be had been writing, with&#xD;
something of impatient surprise on his face.&#xD;
"So late?" he muttered. "On my&#xD;
word, Miss Aylmer has a very royal faculty&#xD;
of forgetting or ignoring-I suppose it is all&#xD;
the same thing-everybody's convenience&#xD;
but her own. Three hours have I been&#xD;
waiting here, in obedience to her command,&#xD;
and yet there is no sign of arrival-Mrs.&#xD;
Bird's parties are not usually so entertain-&#xD;
ing either. A different sort of woman would&#xD;
remember-but, pshaw! Of course she has&#xD;
been taught to believe that everybody must&#xD;
submit to her caprice; and so, perhaps,&#xD;
the fault is hardly hers. I might as well&#xD;
give Gaston another sheet, I suppose; by&#xD;
that time she may condescend to enter an&#xD;
appearance."&#xD;
He. drew a fresh sheet toward him as&#xD;
he spoke, dipped pen in ink, and wrote on&#xD;
rapidly thus:&#xD;
"You ask me what I am doing, and the&#xD;
question is harder to answer than you&#xD;
would at first imagine. I have been paint-&#xD;
ing, of course; but only in a desultory sort&#xD;
of fashion, and to very little effect indeed,&#xD;
Chiefly, I believe, I must bring myself in&#xD;
guilty as 'idler at ease '-and this is a pro-&#xD;
fession the hardships of which we are very&#xD;
apt to undervalue until we have tested them&#xD;
by actual experience. I remember that I&#xD;
used to be incredulous of their existence:&#xD;
but call no man happy till he dies; and from&#xD;
henceforward I take my pity from the liard- I&#xD;
working children of toil, to tender it respect- 1&#xD;
fully to the fine gentlemen who are depend-'&#xD;
out on their own sensations for their amuse- I&#xD;
mont in life, and whb wear out those sensa-&#xD;
'tions, as onewears out the strings of an instru-&#xD;
ment, by constant use. Plainly, I am wearied s&#xD;
to death of this life, and every thing connect- ~&#xD;
ed with it! My wound troubles me very lit- I;&#xD;
tle now, and my health is almost entirely re- t&#xD;
stored; so I shall soon 4rop this artificial -&#xD;
&#xD;
shell, and resume the old existence in so-&#xD;
ber earnest in the old a~elier.- By-the-&#xD;
by, have you seen about renting it for&#xD;
me? I should like that special one, if&#xD;
possible, since so* many pleasant associ-&#xD;
ations are connected with it but any that&#xD;
suits you wrn be sure to sui me. As for&#xD;
further talk of Florence or Rome, I will&#xD;
not listen to it! You are better in Paris&#xD;
than anywhere else, and out of Paris you&#xD;
shall not stir with my consent-least of all,&#xD;
with my connivance. Besides, I honestly&#xD;
prefer it myself. There are many things&#xD;
'that unite to make it the most desirable&#xD;
residence in the world, for the poor as well,&#xD;
as for the rich, for the struggling as well as&#xD;
for the famous. If I ever succeed in my&#xD;
art, it is in Paris that this success will be&#xD;
worth most. If I were not so entirely a&#xD;
cosmopolitan-one of the Bedouins of civ-&#xD;
ilization-I think I should make my home&#xD;
there in preference 1o any other spot of&#xD;
earth. But such a supposition is particu-&#xD;
larly absurd when I am just now possessed&#xD;
with the roving fever worse than ever, and&#xD;
longing for a wider flight than I have taken&#xD;
yet. Do you remember Valdor ?-him who&#xD;
served with the Spahis in Algeria, and had a&#xD;
portfolio of sketches that would have done&#xD;
honor to Gavarni? But of course you do, for&#xD;
he was nota manlikelytobeforgotten. Well,&#xD;
the other day I heard from him. He is&#xD;
down in Mexico, serving in the archduke's&#xD;
-.1 mean the emperor's-Foreig'n Legion.&#xD;
He heard of me from some of my old Con-&#xD;
federate comrades who are there in force&#xD;
just now, and wrote such a letter! It is&#xD;
Valdor himself!-half made up of calli-&#xD;
~raphy, half of etching, and quite the&#xD;
most amusing, reckless, devil-may-care pro-&#xD;
luction that ever was laughed over. What&#xD;
talent the fellow has, and yet he is nothing,&#xD;
~ili die nothing! However, this is not to the&#xD;
)oint. I mentioned him to explain my new&#xD;
'ever. Heurgesme to come to Mexico-prom-&#xD;
se~ a plentiful share of blows and honor, a&#xD;
omission certainly, a dukedom probably,&#xD;
rid the most glorious scenery in the world!&#xD;
~ou would laugh if you knew how strong-&#xD;
y the whole picture tempts me. I always&#xD;
old you that I am as much soldier as artist&#xD;
-and of late I really begin to think~ that&#xD;

&#xD;
the element of soldier predominates. It&#xD;
provokes and yet It amuses me to observe&#xD;
how~ my colors ~ok interest to me, and how&#xD;
I long for one more call of bugle or drum.&#xD;
If it were not for you, I think I should lay&#xD;
my palette aside again, take a portfolio under&#xD;
one arm, and a sword under the other, and&#xD;
start for Mexico. But, diavolo! I am writ-&#xD;
ing nonsense like a girl; for not all the blows&#xD;
and honor in the world could keep me long&#xD;
from you6 I shall 8a11 by the first of next&#xD;
month, at latest, and so, perhaps-"&#xD;
His hand stopped short in its rapid pas-&#xD;
sage over the paper. His quick ear had&#xD;
caught the crash with which a carriage drew&#xD;
up before the door; the next moment, a&#xD;
quick peal echoed through the quiet house,&#xD;
and then there was a rustling ~of dresses and&#xD;
murmur of voices in the hail. Good-nights&#xD;
were exchanged, then a light step ap-&#xD;
proached the library, ahand touched thelock,&#xD;
the door opened, and Darcy rose to meet-&#xD;
not Miss Aylmer, but Madame Vacquant.&#xD;
His surprise must have been manifest in&#xD;
his face, for she laughed a little.&#xD;
. "You here, my dear Maurice?" she said.&#xD;
I did not expect to find any one up. It is&#xD;
after ona o'clock, I see. You must have been&#xD;
pleasantly engaged."&#xD;
"I have been writing," he answered,&#xD;
with a glance at the letter before him ~ "not&#xD;
unpleasantly engaged, therefore. But it. is&#xD;
yon who are late. Surely Mrs. Bird's din-&#xD;
ner-party has not detained you until this&#xD;
hour?"&#xD;
"Oh, no," she answered, carelessly.&#xD;
"After we left, Valerie remembered Mrs.&#xD;
Maitland's reception this evening, and we&#xD;
drove there. We found a very pleasant&#xD;
party, and Mr. Arle engrossed Valerie so&#xD;
much to her satisfaction apparently, that I&#xD;
disliked to disturb them by coming away&#xD;
early. She seems quite tired, however, and&#xD;
has gone to bed. But I am not sleepy at&#xD;
all, so I came in to read for an hour or two.&#xD;
Don't let me disturb you."&#xD;
"You don't disturb me, for I have fin-&#xD;
ished my letter," he answered, quietly. "I&#xD;
think I shall bid you good-night."&#xD;
"Good-night," she answered, with a&#xD;
smile. "I would wish you pleasant dreams,&#xD;
only dreams are such very disappointing&#xD;
&#xD;
things-almost as bad in that way, as&#xD;
women, it is said."&#xD;
"When one has not cherished expecta-&#xD;
tion, one cannot well be disappointed," said&#xD;
Darcy, with his pleasant laugh. "I hope&#xD;
you will have pleasant dreams, and, once&#xD;
more, good-night."&#xD;
The door closed on him, and he went his&#xD;
way up-stairs, secretly no little puzzled by&#xD;
the word-play just passed. Evidently she&#xD;
knew that he had been expecting Valerie,&#xD;
and that Valerie had seen fit to break the&#xD;
appointment of her own making; but what&#xD;
then? Truly, she also knew Maurice Darcy&#xD;
very little, if she fancied that the disappoint-&#xD;
ment was more to him than mere matter for&#xD;
a smile over this fresh proof of Miss Ayl-&#xD;
mer's fickle caprice.&#xD;
He was still smiling that smile to him-&#xD;
self, as he passed to his chamber, when, from&#xD;
a corridor on the left, Fanchette advanced&#xD;
and suddenly waylaid him.&#xD;
"Miss Valerie told me to give you this,&#xD;
sir," she said, presenting a card; "and will&#xD;
you please send an answer by me?"&#xD;
He looked at the bit of pasteboard. It&#xD;
only held four lines:&#xD;
"Be kind enough to suspend judgment&#xD;
on my apparent incivility until you see me.&#xD;
Will you be in the library to-morrow morn-&#xD;
ing? If so, I must ask you to wait for mc."&#xD;
He turned the card over, and in the dim&#xD;
light wrote a line or two on the reverse&#xD;
side:&#xD;
"Of course, I will be at Miss Aylmer's&#xD;
service to-morrow morning. I send the&#xD;
answer to her note-trusting that it may&#xD;
prove favorable."&#xD;
He took a sealed envelope from his&#xD;
pocket, handed it together with the card to&#xD;
Fanchette, bidding her deliver them to her&#xD;
mistress, and then went his way to his own&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Darcy did not have long to wait next&#xD;
morning. He went straight to the library&#xD;
after breakfast, and, before many minutes,&#xD;
Valerie followed him. He thought when&#xD;
she came in that she looked rather pale and&#xD;
worn, but neither of them spoke until she&#xD;
had crossed the room to where he stood by&#xD;
the fireplace. Then she asked, quickly;&#xD;
&#xD;
"Did you wait for me long last night?"&#xD;
"Not very long," lie answered-" not&#xD;
longer than I should probably have waited&#xD;
even if I had not received your message."&#xD;
"What must you have thought of mel"&#xD;
she said, passionately. "It was bad enough&#xD;
that I, who have no claim upon you, should&#xD;
have made an appointment at all; but to&#xD;
make it and break it-what must you have&#xD;
thought of me!"&#xD;
"What should I think, excepting that&#xD;
you exercised your feminine privilege of ca-&#xD;
price?" he answered, with a smile. "Pray,&#xD;
don't apologize-I know how tired and how&#xD;
little like talking you must have felt after a&#xD;
Bird dinner and a Maitland party."&#xD;
"But I must apologize, or rather I must&#xD;
explain," she said, hastily. "You evidently&#xD;
don't understand at all. Caprice! you are&#xD;
kind to call it that; but I think it would&#xD;
have been something infinitely worse if I had&#xD;
acted so. I suppose Madame Vacquant told&#xD;
you about the Maitland party-did she also&#xD;
tell you that it was she who persisted in&#xD;
going, though I begged her not to do so;&#xD;
and that she only consented to come away&#xD;
when she found I absolutely would not re-&#xD;
main any longer?~~&#xD;
"No," he replied, with a slight arch of&#xD;
the eyebrows. "She certainly did not tcll&#xD;
me that."&#xD;
"Nor how she prevented my seeing you&#xD;
by announcing her own intention of coming&#xD;
here to read? Well, those were my reasons&#xD;
for not appearing: and now you can see&#xD;
how much 'caprice' had to do with them.&#xD;
I should not have troubled you again this&#xD;
morning, if I had not wished to explain this."&#xD;
"There was really no necessity for ex-&#xD;
planation," he said; "still I am not sorry&#xD;
you have made it. Only, one thing puzzles&#xD;
me-why Madame Vacquant should have&#xD;
wished to keep you from seeing me."&#xD;
"It might puzzle me if I had not long&#xD;
ago ceased to wonder at any thing she&#xD;
does," Valerie answered; "and also if I had&#xD;
not been thinking of other things. You saw&#xD;
my note to Julian, and it is only fair that&#xD;
you should see his answer. But first, one&#xD;
question-did you find any thing in mine&#xD;
that was hasty or inconsiderate, any thing&#xD;
that co-ild have given offence?"&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
Assuredly not;" he answered. "Noth-&#xD;
ing could have been more kind or consider-&#xD;
ate. There was not a single expression that&#xD;
could possibly have merited resentment."&#xD;
Her lip curled-he thought with scorn-&#xD;
and she handed him the envelope he had&#xD;
sent her the night before. "Well, now,&#xD;
look at his answer," she said.&#xD;
He drew forth the enclosure-simply a&#xD;
sheet of paper torn completely in two. A&#xD;
glance showed him that it was her own note&#xD;
thus sent back to her without one word of&#xD;
comment. For a moment he looked at it&#xD;
incredulously; then Valerie was almost&#xD;
startled by the angry light that flashed into&#xD;
his eyes. and the angry color that rose to&#xD;
his brow.&#xD;
"Was this all?" he asked.&#xD;
"That was all," she answered.&#xD;
"And he made me the bearer of such&#xD;
an insult! Miss Aylmer, I beg you to be-&#xD;
lieve-"&#xD;
She interrupted him by a gesture of si-&#xD;
lence. "Pray don't think any assurance of&#xD;
your ignorance necessary," she said. "Of&#xD;
course you knew nothing about it; but what&#xD;
does this prove to you-concerning him?"&#xD;
"That he is an unmannered churl!" he&#xD;
answered, concisely; "and that he needs a&#xD;
lesson in breeding, which I shall take great&#xD;
pleasure in giving him."&#xD;
"Indeed, you niust do nothing of the&#xD;
~kind," she cried, quickly. "I should never&#xD;
forgive myself for my folly in showing you&#xD;
this, if you, of all people, resented it on my&#xD;
behalf."&#xD;
"You forget the position in which it&#xD;
places me."&#xD;
"And whose fault is that? Surely mine,&#xD;
since I made you my ambassador. No, Cap-&#xD;
tam Darcy, you must never mention the mat-&#xD;
ter to Julian. Promise me that you will let&#xD;
it rest as if I had not shown you this."&#xD;
"Let it rest I-why, you surely don't&#xD;
think me absurd enough to be drawn into&#xD;
a quarrel with a foolish, spiteful boy like&#xD;
this?"&#xD;
"No matter what I think. Promise me&#xD;
that you will not let him know that you are&#xD;
aware of his incivility."&#xD;
"He deserves-."&#xD;
"No matter what he deserves. If we&#xD;

&#xD;
- come to deserts, the most of us would fare&#xD;
badly enough. Promise me, I say!"&#xD;
tie looked at her with a smile. Already&#xD;
his -brief anger had passed, and he was&#xD;
amused by the imperious command of her&#xD;
tone. "I imagine a great many people must&#xD;
have told you that to hear is to obey," he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"You neyer did, at all events. dome,&#xD;
have I your word of honor that this remains&#xD;
between you and me?"&#xD;
"If nothing les4 will satisfy you-yes."&#xD;
She smiled brightly-so brightly that he&#xD;
saw at once why many people had found liv-&#xD;
ing sunshine in her face. "Thank you!"&#xD;
she said, with her pretty, gracious bend of&#xD;
the head. "I am quite satisfied. And now&#xD;
let me tell you something that you may be&#xD;
astonished to hear: Julian was in this house&#xD;
last night."&#xD;
She lowered her voice in making the&#xD;
statement; but, to her surprise, iDarcy heard&#xD;
it quite unmoved.&#xD;
"Well," he said, quietly, "why should he&#xD;
not be here I"&#xD;
"Then why should he not stay here?"&#xD;
she asked, impatiently. "Why should there&#xD;
be all This mystery, unless for the purpose&#xD;
of making me uncomfortable?"&#xD;
"Probably that may be the cause of it,"&#xD;
he answered, coolly.&#xD;
"Was there ever any thing more ungen-&#xD;
erous,-then I&#xD;
"Rot often, I grant you. But don't&#xD;
* blame Julian more than he deserves. He&#xD;
may not be able to meet you as an ordinary&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
For answer her eye turned tQ the torn&#xD;
letter lying on the table between them. He&#xD;
saw the glance, and touched the envelope&#xD;
rather disdainfully with ihis hand. -&#xD;
"Even this might be accepted as proof&#xD;
of it," he said. -&#xD;
a~o::,Yet you did not think so a moment&#xD;
"Pardon me. I only could not excuse&#xD;
him for ceasing to be a gentleman, because&#xD;
he became a lover."&#xD;
He spoke very indifferently, but Valerie&#xD;
could not1 help thinking how little likely it&#xD;
was that e would ever be swayed from his&#xD;
even course by any such vagaries o~ passion&#xD;
&#xD;
as those they were discussing. She even&#xD;
gave pi~rtial utterance to this reflection:&#xD;
"You are the last man in the world to&#xD;
judge Julian," she said, a little indignantly.&#xD;
"You are as cold as he is mercurial; and&#xD;
you know nothing of the passion which in-&#xD;
fluences him so entirely."&#xD;
"I am certainly very ignorant of how far&#xD;
common-sense and love are incompatibili-&#xD;
~ he answered, carelessly. "Well, ha~re&#xD;
you any further commands for me?"&#xD;
"Rot unless you choose to comfort him&#xD;
with the assurance that before long I hope&#xD;
to be in my dear Louisiana."&#xD;
"And I in France. So, as we are about&#xD;
to go our different paths, may we not bury&#xD;
the tomahawk, and smoke the pipe of peace&#xD;
together during the few days still remaining&#xD;
of our accidental association?"&#xD;
"With all my heart," she answered.&#xD;
"Indeed, I am glad to he able to feel that&#xD;
the tomahawk might have been buried and&#xD;
the pipe smoked long ago, with my full con-&#xD;
sent."&#xD;
He looked at her in smiling surprise.&#xD;
"Do you mean that it is I who have been&#xD;
accountable for our want of friendly under-&#xD;
standing?"&#xD;
"Yes, I mean exactly that," she an-&#xD;
swered. "I offered you my friendship when&#xD;
you made your frank explanation that day&#xD;
in the picture-gallery.- Do you remember?&#xD;
you thought fit to put it very coldly aside;&#xD;
and I need hardly say that I am not accus-&#xD;
tomed to making such proffers twice. I see&#xD;
you cannot deny this."&#xD;
He certainly could not, nor did he make&#xD;
an effort to do so. He looked at her, and&#xD;
said, "Perhaps such conduct was only wis-&#xD;
dom."&#xD;
So little idea had she of any thing like a&#xD;
compliment from him, that she asked simply,&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
- "I think you should know why," he an-&#xD;
swered. "There is said to be no middle&#xD;
ground for those who come near you. - In-&#xD;
difference can never soften into liking, and&#xD;
stop short there. Row, I hadno mind to go&#xD;
farther. I am very sure you are not sati-&#xD;
ated with conquest, and there was safety&#xD;
only in distance. You can best tell whether&#xD;
I misjudged you or not; butl fancied at one&#xD;
&#xD;
time that you would not have been averse&#xD;
to adding even my poor scalp to the many&#xD;
trophies already hanging at your belt!"&#xD;
He spoke composedly, almost coldly; but&#xD;
Valerie heard him with a dismay and bitter-&#xD;
ness hardly to be described. Then he had&#xD;
read her so thoroughly as that !-read even&#xD;
her paltry vanity, her poor ambition, her&#xD;
pitiful resolves to attract him! No wonder&#xD;
that he despised her I-no wonder that he&#xD;
wore an armor of mail against all her&#xD;
shafts !-no wonder that they wakened in&#xD;
him only scornful contempt! Mortification&#xD;
tingled through every vein, until her cheeks&#xD;
were burning and her eyes were almost&#xD;
overflowing, before she had found a word to&#xD;
say. At first she lifted her head haughtily&#xD;
enough, but then-was denial possible? She&#xD;
* ,'sad striven to attract him, solely for the&#xD;
gratification of her own vanity; and, even if&#xD;
he would have believed her, she disdained&#xD;
equivocation. Indeed, she had a regal scorn&#xD;
of any thing like pretence, and nobody had&#xD;
ever been able to say of her thatshe benched&#xD;
from the consequences of any action. When&#xD;
at last she lifted her eyes to his, they were&#xD;
proud even in their humility.&#xD;
"You are right,7~ she said,; "I did en-&#xD;
deavor to attract you-and failed entirely.&#xD;
And-perhaps you may be surprised to hear&#xD;
-I was glad to do so. I should have felt a&#xD;
contempt for you if you had yielded, as so&#xD;
many others have done; but I was glad to&#xD;
learn what I have always believed, that there&#xD;
are some men strong enough in heart and&#xD;
head to see how much a coquette's beauty&#xD;
and a coquette's arts are worth. I have liked&#xD;
you honestly and sincerely ever since that&#xD;
day of which I spoke a moment ago; and&#xD;
I liked you all the better, and respected you&#xD;
all the more, when I tried my experiment and&#xD;
failed; when I found that, instead of attract-&#xD;
ing, I only repelled- you. You will think&#xD;
this strange, perhaps. I don't pretend to ac-&#xD;
count for it. * I only know that it is so, that&#xD;
I have long been conscious of it. I know&#xD;
what you think of me-how vain, and weak,&#xD;
and cruel, you consider me-but if you ever -&#xD;
remember me in the future, let it be with -&#xD;
this scant justice, that lam glad ~iome at least&#xD;
never suffered a pang through me."&#xD;
Suddenly and without warning, the quick&#xD;
&#xD;
tones ceased; and turning abruptly, so as to&#xD;
give him no time for answer, she moved&#xD;
toward the door. To her surprise Darcy&#xD;
was there before her, with his hand on the&#xD;
lock.&#xD;
"One moment, Miss Aylmer," he said.&#xD;
But Valerie scarcely heard and did not&#xD;
at all heed him. Some strange, wild emotion&#xD;
was tugging at her heart so fiercely that&#xD;
her ungovernable impulse was to rush away&#xD;
with it-anywhere, so that it was out of&#xD;
sight and reach. Sharply, almost angrily,&#xD;
she said:&#xD;
"Let me pass, if you plea~e."&#xD;
"Will you not even hear me?"&#xD;
"Ro. Let me pass."&#xD;
But he stood perfectly still, looking down&#xD;
on her with something like a smile of tri-&#xD;
umph on his face, and his hand still resting&#xD;
upon the lock.&#xD;
- "Ray, then, I must be rude enough to&#xD;
detain you," he said, gently. "Valerie!-&#xD;
look at me. Are you indeed so blind as not&#xD;
to see and know what this is?"&#xD;
She looked up at him in sudden amaze-&#xD;
ment, but not doubt-never again doubt.&#xD;
Let the future hold what it would for them,&#xD;
they could never again mistake each other.&#xD;
Never again could they unlearn the knowl-&#xD;
edge read in one another's eyes as they stood&#xD;
face to face in that brief moment. Never&#xD;
again fail to see that this was love. Like a&#xD;
flash it came to one at least, as, with a great&#xD;
gasp, the proud head of La belle des belles&#xD;
went down-on Maurice Darcy's shoulder!&#xD;
All conflict was over. The victor's hand&#xD;
gathered up the reins of power, and there&#xD;
was nothing to be said or done. He asserted&#xD;
a fact, and claimed a right-that was all.&#xD;
Men, many men, had offered theinsetves to -&#xD;
this woman, and pleaded their cause with&#xD;
force and passion; but n~ man had ever be-&#xD;
fore taken quiet possession of the citadel as&#xD;
of his own unquestioned property; no man&#xD;
had ever closed in a hand-to-hand grapple,&#xD;
and wrested the sword from the fair grasp&#xD;
that had held it so long triumphantly; and&#xD;
perhaps this was the only way in which&#xD;
victory was ever possible.&#xD;
It was not very long before Valerie&#xD;
rallied, however-not long before she raised&#xD;
her flushed face and shining eyes with a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
question that proved how strong the ruling&#xD;
passion was, even in defeat.&#xD;
"What does Sir Artegall say now?"&#xD;
Then Darcy bent his stately head, even&#xD;
as Sir Artegall may have bent his, before&#xD;
Badegunde's fair face and lifted vizor, while&#xD;
he answered;&#xD;
"He says that his weapons lie at your&#xD;
feet. He Waits his sentence from your lips.&#xD;
Whatever it be, he hopes to bear it bravely,&#xD;
but he prays one favor: speak it quickly!"&#xD;
It was a favor that she did not grant. On&#xD;
the contrary, she stoodlooking athini silently&#xD;
and long-the sense of weakness and the&#xD;
sense of power mingled in a manner which&#xD;
would have set a metaphysician frantic, but&#xD;
which is perfectly intelligible to anywoman&#xD;
within whose breast there beats a woman's&#xD;
heart. She was conqueror, yet she was con-&#xD;
quered! For one long minute she exulted&#xD;
in the consciousness of the first; then the&#xD;
still more delicious realization of the second&#xD;
rushed over her, and she held out her hand,&#xD;
with a proud grtice like that of no other&#xD;
woman, saying only:&#xD;
"Be gentle with your captive."*&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
FETTERS OF ROSES.&#xD;
"VALERIE, you are dazzling!'~&#xD;
It was Alix who spoke thus in a tone of&#xD;
surprised admiration, as Miss Aylmer entered&#xD;
her roqx~ to bid her good-evening before&#xD;
going down to dinner. The little lady was&#xD;
confined to her chamber with a severe cold,&#xD;
and bore her enforced exile on the whole&#xD;
very cheerfully; but she looked up with aln-&#xD;
cere pleasure on hearing her friend's step&#xD;
outside, and when the door opened she gave&#xD;
vent to 1~his exclamation-and an exclama-&#xD;
tion so evidently wrung from her by the im-&#xD;
pulse of the moment, that Valerie started&#xD;
and blushed.&#xD;
"What is there extraordinary about&#xD;
me?" she asked. "Am I looking better&#xD;
than usual?"&#xD;
"Very iuucb better," Alix answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
"But-.but I really cannot tell what the&#xD;
difference is, though there is a difference."&#xD;
"You are sure of that?"&#xD;
"Quite sure."&#xD;
Miss Aylmer laughed to herself-a soft,&#xD;
happy laugh-and then she went over and&#xD;
looked in the mirror. It showed her a face&#xD;
that was indeed literallytransfigured by some&#xD;
bright inner light-a light that would have&#xD;
made even an ugly face beautiful, and that&#xD;
rendered hers, as Alix had said, literally&#xD;
"dazzling? "-a light that shone in every&#xD;
glance of the eyes, and smiled in every curve&#xD;
of the mouth; that lay like a sunbeam on the&#xD;
fair, serene brow, and pervaded every line&#xD;
of the graceful features. Truly the great&#xD;
glorified, Happiness, had touched her with&#xD;
his magic wand! Truly she might well wear&#xD;
that quiet dress, and relieve her glorious hair&#xD;
by only one knot of bright ribbon; for the&#xD;
woman so adorned needs no aid from art.&#xD;
~he is above and beyond it. So long as her&#xD;
eyes shine with that happy lustre, and h~er&#xD;
lips wear that enchanting smile, she need&#xD;
give no heed to the toilet, for homespun&#xD;
could not lessen, nor satin heighten her&#xD;
charms. So Valerie seemed to feel, for she&#xD;
looked at herself from head to foot, with one&#xD;
radiant and satisfied glance; and then she&#xD;
went over and kisse'1 her enthusiastic ad-&#xD;
mirer.&#xD;
"I am so sorry you are not well enough&#xD;
to come down," she said. "We shall miss&#xD;
you, especially as we are all alone to-night.&#xD;
It is very likely, too, that Mr. Thornton will&#xD;
make his appearance. ~'ou have certainly&#xD;
achieved a serious conquest of that redoubt-&#xD;
able critic. He met me on Baltimore Street&#xD;
the other day, and absolutely walked home&#xD;
with me!"&#xD;
"And can you account for that in no&#xD;
other way ethan by a serious conquest of&#xD;
mine?"&#xD;
"Not when it is taken in connection with&#xD;
the fact that he talked of Miss Rivi~re, and*&#xD;
Miss Rivi~re's voice, without intermission.&#xD;
from French's to the Monument."&#xD;
"If it depended upon you," said Alix,&#xD;
with a faint laugh, "I think I should soon&#xD;
be an exceedingly dangerous person. You&#xD;
are continnaily laying some fresh slaughter~&#xD;
at my door, and bringing me in guilty of&#xD;
&#xD;
some new act of malice. What a pity that&#xD;
other people-and especially the reported&#xD;
victims-cannot be induced to see matters&#xD;
in the same light! I mighf really, after a&#xD;
while- Ab, what exquisite flowers!"&#xD;
She broke off with this exclamation, as&#xD;
the door opened, and Fanchette appeared,&#xD;
carrying a large bouquet.&#xD;
"What lovely camellias! what a superb&#xD;
daphne!" Valerie said, eagerly, taking it&#xD;
from the maid. "Whom are they for?"&#xD;
"I don't know, ma~ am," Fanchette an-&#xD;
swered. "Pierre was, in a hurry, and he&#xD;
just told me to bring ~em up-stairs1"&#xD;
"There must be a card," Alix suggested.&#xD;
And, truly enough, a moment's search&#xD;
resulted in finding one. "L. Howard Thorn-&#xD;
ton," Valerie read triumphantly from one&#xD;
side, while on the reverse was pencilled,&#xD;
"With best wishes for Miss Rivi~re's speedy&#xD;
recovery."&#xD;
"Victoria!" she cried, gayly. "A Saul&#xD;
among the prophets! Alix, I congratulate&#xD;
you. These flowers are tokens how com-&#xD;
pletely you have won over for ever and ever&#xD;
the lbrmidable critic of the Journal."&#xD;
"It is very kind of him to remember&#xD;
me," said Alix, receiving the bouquet and&#xD;
blushing like a rose. "The flowers are love-.&#xD;
ly; and I am very much obliged. Please,&#xD;
tell him so, if he comes, Valerie."&#xD;
"I wish you could tell him so yourself,&#xD;
yotite. He will lose the blush, and miss the&#xD;
smile dreadfully, when I deliver the message.&#xD;
Now I must go. Enjoy your flowers, and&#xD;
be sure you don't grow lonely."&#xD;
"Xo, Ishall not be lonely. Besides the&#xD;
flowers, I have that new Blao7~woo~Z which&#xD;
Captain Darcy sent me to-4ay. Don't for-&#xD;
get to give my love to him."&#xD;
"Ah! that, too, will lose value in the&#xD;
transmission through a third person. Love&#xD;
always does. Good-by."&#xD;
She flitted from the room, and went&#xD;
down-stairs, singing like a bird, out of the&#xD;
very joyousness of 1~er heart. But, when&#xD;
she opened the drawing-room door, a face&#xD;
rose up before her which hushed the words&#xD;
on her lips in sheer surprise. Certainly the&#xD;
last person she ht~d expec~e4 to meet was&#xD;
Romney; and yet, there he was, leaning&#xD;
against the mantel in a well-remembered at-&#xD;
&#xD;
titude, with the same stormy face and the&#xD;
same frown that she had seen last. Aston-&#xD;
ishment caused her to make one pause, then&#xD;
she advancedinto the room with outstretched&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"JulianP' she cried, eagerly. "What&#xD;
a pleasant surprise! I am very glad to-"&#xD;
"See you," she would have added, if his&#xD;
manner had not frozen back the unfinished&#xD;
words. But few women would have cared&#xD;
to waste a cordial greeting on any man who&#xD;
met it as Romney met this-with simple re-&#xD;
pellent coldness. He barely touched the&#xD;
slender fingers held out to him; and his few&#xD;
words of reply were wholly inaudible, while&#xD;
the dark cloud never once lifted from his&#xD;
brow, making it a relief to Valerie to turn&#xD;
round and plunge into conversation with her&#xD;
grandfather; for both M. and Madame Vac-&#xD;
quant were~present. There was an embar-&#xD;
rassed interval of several minutes thus&#xD;
bridged over, before the door opened, and&#xD;
sunshine entered the room in Maurice Dar-&#xD;
cy's eyes ~nd smile. Almost immediately&#xD;
afterward, dinner was announced.&#xD;
They went down-stairs in silence, and it&#xD;
is impossible to coxijecture how the next&#xD;
hour would have passed, had it not been for&#xD;
Darcy's persevering efforts to make conver-&#xD;
sation. They were so indefatigable that they&#xD;
deserved the success which they partially&#xD;
achieved. Only partially, however~ for Ju-&#xD;
han's moody face and petulant remarks&#xD;
were not conducive to social ease, and, to-&#xD;
gether with his mother's unusual gravity,&#xD;
so seriously burdened the air, that eyen 1!.&#xD;
Vacquant's efforts to talk had an unmistak-&#xD;
ably forced air, and Valerie was almost to-&#xD;
tally silent. After a while the two gentle-&#xD;
men drifted into the dreary sea of politics,&#xD;
and remained there until the ceremony of&#xD;
dinner came to an end.&#xD;
Juhian did not renter the drawing-room,&#xD;
but left the house almost immediately, while&#xD;
Valerie, who had little inclination to remain&#xD;
under Madame Vacquant's eyes, wandered&#xD;
away until she found herself in the conserva-&#xD;
tory. There she sat down-to wait.&#xD;
Not long, however. Not long had the&#xD;
fountain risen and fallen in its steady, z'nisi-&#xD;
cal cadence, before there came a sound which&#xD;
banished all the melody of waters from her&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8073-00000068"/>&#xD;
134                      VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
ears-the echo of a distant voice, the soun&#xD;
of a nearing tread, the parting of the leaf~&#xD;
screens, and, in the mellow light, the gran(&#xD;
head and stately figure of her royal-lookin~&#xD;
free-lance lover.&#xD;
He saw her in a moment, and came for&#xD;
*    ward, a world of light in his eyes and on hii&#xD;
lips, yet his first words were almost of vexa&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I wish I could have spared you that,&#xD;
Are you weary, liellis8imc$?"&#xD;
She looked up at him, wonderingly.&#xD;
"Weary! What, that dreadful dinner,&#xD;
do you mean? :N~o, I had almost forgotten&#xD;
it. You see how little power annoyances&#xD;
have over me now."&#xD;
The last word was almost inaudible,&#xD;
but so significant that the warm blood swept&#xD;
brightly over Darcy's brow. A little while&#xD;
back, and he would have steeled himself&#xD;
into granite against such a tone from her&#xD;
lips; but now-well, had he not surrendered&#xD;
himself to the sweet enchantment, and what&#xD;
was there further needed of cold wisdom&#xD;
and colder self-discipline? And so his mur-&#xD;
mured tones were full of that poetic folly&#xD;
which is sweeter in the ears of those who&#xD;
love than all the wisdom of all the philoso-&#xD;
phers who ever rounded periods - from&#xD;
Socrates down. And Valerie listened to&#xD;
him with a wistful, eager look on her face&#xD;
which might have seemed strange, if her&#xD;
next words had not explained it.&#xD;
"Then, if all this be true, if I am indeed&#xD;
so fair and charming in your eyes, surely&#xD;
your distrust of me must have vanished.&#xD;
Tell me if it be so? Don't be afraid to&#xD;
say no-I only care to hear truth from&#xD;
yQu.~~&#xD;
"Distrust," he repeated, quickly. "What&#xD;
do you mean?"&#xD;
5h9 looked up at him a little reproach-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
"If you ask me that, I shall think that&#xD;
you know only too well, and don't wish to&#xD;
answer. Ah, what cam I mean save the&#xD;
wretched coquetry which held you from me&#xD;
so long? Maurice, tell me-do you still&#xD;
think so badly of me ?-do you still distrust&#xD;
me so utterly as you did even a few days&#xD;
*ago?"&#xD;
There was no art in the question, no striv-&#xD;
&#xD;
FETTERS OF ROSES.                       135&#xD;
&#xD;
I ing to draw forth protestations or vows, but&#xD;
~ a strange, earnest pathos and doubt, which&#xD;
I gave a yearning inquiry to the eyes lifted to&#xD;
his own, and touched to its very core the&#xD;
heart of the man who loved her. For&#xD;
answer, he only drew her to his side, and,&#xD;
bending down, laid his lips lightly and&#xD;
tenderly on her own.&#xD;
"There is my reply," he said. "There&#xD;
is my seal on all the past. Let us never&#xD;
speak of it again."&#xD;
But still she was not content.&#xD;
" Tell me" she repeated. "Tell mein&#xD;
so many words, that you trust me-that you&#xD;
believe I never meant wilful harm in the&#xD;
past, and that you are sure I can never mean&#xD;
it in the future."&#xD;
"I do believe it, and I am sure of it," he&#xD;
answered, proudly. "Do you think I could&#xD;
love you, and doubt you ?-do you think I&#xD;
could hold you thus, and distrust you even&#xD;
in the least degree? No "-and it was a&#xD;
very grand scorn that quickened in the deep-&#xD;
gray eyes-" I never practise half-measures..&#xD;
I demand a perfect and entire faith from all&#xD;
who love me. Like Cnur de Lion, I never&#xD;
bade man do what I would not do myself.&#xD;
I do trust you wholly and entirely. And&#xD;
from henceforth there is but one evidence I&#xD;
shall receive against you-the evidence of&#xD;
yourself. Now, are you satisfied?"&#xD;
Satisfied! Ah, he might have read that&#xD;
in the eyes that looked up at him so warmly&#xD;
and gratefully, in the smile of perfect con-&#xD;
tent that came around the lips, in the tone&#xD;
that murmured softly-&#xD;
"You have made me so happy!"&#xD;
He smiled brightly, perhaps again with&#xD;
a shade of triumph, and passed his hand&#xD;
many times caressingly over her rippling&#xD;
hair. He seemed made to woo in a royal&#xD;
fashion of his own-made to gather fresh&#xD;
dignity from a position in which most of his&#xD;
sex grow for the time being pliant and hum-&#xD;
ble. It was next to impossible to imagine&#xD;
him suing for favors instead of taking them,&#xD;
captive instead of captor, conquered instead&#xD;
of conqueror. And yet it was the simplicity&#xD;
about him, the utter absence of all vanity or&#xD;
pretence, which. made this, that in another&#xD;
man would have been unutterably revolting,&#xD;
so rarely attractive in him. It was because&#xD;
&#xD;
Nature had stamped him with such a regal&#xD;
signet, that it was not a bitter sight to see&#xD;
this fair, proud woman-this woman who&#xD;
had long been free and timeless as any wild&#xD;
creature of the forest-own subjection at&#xD;
his hand, and yield herself unreservedly to&#xD;
be rendered happy or miserable by the breath&#xD;
of his lips.&#xD;
But at least she was happy-perfectly&#xD;
and entirely happy. No one looking on&#xD;
could have doubted that for a moment and&#xD;
though neither of them knew it, some one&#xD;
did look on. Once, for a minute only, a&#xD;
~ale face gleamed on them from between&#xD;
the blossoms of a gorgeous azalea, and then&#xD;
vanished. A woman's dress swept noise-&#xD;
lessly over the marble floor, and all was&#xD;
quiet and silence again when Valerie said,&#xD;
gently:&#xD;
"I have stood in awe of you so long,&#xD;
that I do not think I shall soon learn the&#xD;
perfect love which casteth out fear. I have&#xD;
little doubt that I shall be afraid of you for&#xD;
a good while to come.~~&#xD;
"Afraid of me! Then it is I who need to&#xD;
complain of distrust. Afraid of me? When&#xD;
have you ever seen any thing to teach you&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"You surely forget how hard and stern&#xD;
you have seemed-especially to my poor&#xD;
failings-many a time."&#xD;
"And you did not know that I was steel-&#xD;
ing myself against loving those failings?&#xD;
But the charge may be just enough in some&#xD;
aspects. You would scarcely wonder, either,&#xD;
if you knew the history of my life; if you&#xD;
could know how entirely without softening&#xD;
infiu~nces it has been, what a bitter hand-to-&#xD;
hand fight with the world and adverse cir-&#xD;
cumstances, owning but two ties of human&#xD;
kindred, since my mother's death. From&#xD;
different reasons, each of these ties has teen&#xD;
the source of sorrow and suffering. A&#xD;
character of suffering, too, which corrodes&#xD;
and hardens a man's nature. Yet even now,&#xD;
I don't think I am ever implacable,, save to&#xD;
deception or betrayal-and I have neither&#xD;
deception nor betrayal to dread from your&#xD;
hand. Look up, my love, and tell me if&#xD;
you think I could ever be hard or stern to&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
She did look up, and met an almost-&#xD;
&#xD;
womanly tenderness of gaze in the eyes bent&#xD;
upon her, an almost womanly gentleness&#xD;
around the lips.&#xD;
"You certainly don't look very formida-&#xD;
ble just now," she said, with a soft laugh.&#xD;
"But I feel very much as Una must have felt&#xD;
when she first' made the acquaintance of her&#xD;
lion-dreadfully uncertain how long his good&#xD;
behavior will last."&#xD;
"Ah, but remember that, with all his&#xD;
faults, he was a generous beast," he an-&#xD;
swered, "and was never known to betray a&#xD;
trust. Then, have you forgotten your talis-&#xD;
man? Have you so little reliance on your&#xD;
-' angel-face&#xD;
That makes a sunshine in a shady place?"'&#xD;
She lifted it up, so that the mellow lamp-&#xD;
light streamed full upon its fair Southern&#xD;
grace and beauty, while the lustrous eyes&#xD;
looked at him, full of their old archness.&#xD;
"Very little indeed of the angel in it, I&#xD;
fear," she said; "but, if it makes sunshine&#xD;
for you, I shall think it has found its right&#xD;
use in the world at last."&#xD;
"If it makes! And do you doubtit?"&#xD;
"Never at least foi' lack of will on my&#xD;
part," she answered, with sweet gravity.&#xD;
And after his answer-the answer of a&#xD;
lover-brief but happy silence settled over&#xD;
them.&#xD;
It was broken at last by Darey, who had&#xD;
not overrftuch 'of the Romeo in his composi-&#xD;
tion, and whose mind had already left the&#xD;
"sweet nothings7~ of courtship, to consider&#xD;
its practical issues.&#xD;
~"Douce arnie," he said, in his frank,&#xD;
straightforward way, "our happiness must&#xD;
not make us forget our obligations to others.&#xD;
Have I your permission to write to you'r&#xD;
father to-night, and to announce our engage-&#xD;
ment to my uncle in the morning?"&#xD;
He put the question simply, and in a&#xD;
matter-of-course tone-as little prepared for&#xD;
any thing like denial as for the manner in&#xD;
which that denial came. But those two&#xD;
names were gall and wormwood to Valerie,&#xD;
since, alas for our poor heroine I the bitter&#xD;
drop in her cup of rapture was the recollec-&#xD;
tion that she had fallen into the snare of&#xD;
the obnoxious "arrangement ;" that she was&#xD;
on the eve of being forced to recant every&#xD;

156                        VALERIE AYLMER.                                                                  ]flITTERS OF ROSES.                      1 S'7&#xD;
&#xD;
declaration she had ever made concerning&#xD;
it, and to give the most signal triumph to&#xD;
her father and grandfather. So, when Darcy&#xD;
spoke thus, she started; then a cloud swept&#xD;
over her surniy face, and she answered, al-&#xD;
most petulantly:&#xD;
'KNo. I will not give you permission&#xD;
to do any thing of the kind. The present&#xD;
state of affairs is very pleasant-why should&#xD;
you wish to change it? Why wish to usher&#xD;
in all the disagrecables of a public engage-&#xD;
ment?"&#xD;
He looked at her in surprise. "Simply&#xD;
because it is the only right and honorable&#xD;
thing to do," he answered.&#xD;
"Right and honorable!" repeated Va-&#xD;
lerie, with a light laugh. "Those are very&#xD;
grand words, men. ami-too grand by half,&#xD;
considering that we know as well now as&#xD;
we can know hereafter that everybody con-&#xD;
cerned will be only too pleased."&#xD;
"Will they?" he said. "Then there is&#xD;
so much the more reason for owing them an&#xD;
immediate announcement."&#xD;
"Ab, grant me grace," she cried, plead-&#xD;
ingly. "I love my freedom so dearly, and&#xD;
-and I dread so much to give it up."&#xD;
"You count it still your own, then?"&#xD;
Half-earnestly, half-jestingly, he asked&#xD;
the question; and she looked up with the&#xD;
proud humility he had seen in her once be-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
"No," she said, softly, "It is not my&#xD;
own. But my fetters are of roses now; and&#xD;
I dread lest they become links of steel.&#xD;
And I also dread lest I chafe against them&#xD;
then. Let me grow accustomed to captivity.&#xD;
Nfaurice, &amp;amp;few days-only a few days-can-&#xD;
not matter about making this announce-&#xD;
She looked up imploringly-she, ever ac-&#xD;
- customer to command-but although he left&#xD;
a tender caress upon the lips that spoke his&#xD;
name so sweetly, it was plain that he had no&#xD;
thought of yielding-it was plain that this&#xD;
request was to him only a child's caprice,&#xD;
to be humored and treated gently, but not&#xD;
indulged.&#xD;
"Mignonne," he said, kindly, "a few&#xD;
days can matter a great deal. We are in a&#xD;
false position as long as this continues-a&#xD;
false position to those whose right It is to&#xD;
&#xD;
know our future as soon as we know it our-&#xD;
selves. It is not so much that secrecy in&#xD;
this case would be wrong, as that the prin-&#xD;
ciple of secrecy is wrong."&#xD;
At another time she might have admired,&#xD;
as she had often admired before~ the open,&#xD;
~hivalric spirit that spoke here as it spoke&#xD;
in every thought and action of his life; the&#xD;
clear, brave stroke that cleft in two any diffi-&#xD;
culty, and the frank gaze that never even&#xD;
seemed to see any path save the one straight&#xD;
avenue of honor. But now it clashed with&#xD;
her own desire-a desire grown stronger by&#xD;
the opposition it had met-and she felt al-&#xD;
most impatient of his punctilio as she an-&#xD;
swered:&#xD;
"You ought to remember that we are&#xD;
not in the Old World; and that matters of&#xD;
this sort are not conducted here with any&#xD;
of the stately decorum and disagreeable&#xD;
publicity which attend them there."&#xD;
"Surely decorum cannot be objection-&#xD;
able," he said. "And publicity, it seems to&#xD;
me, only becomes so when engagement is&#xD;
regarded as a convenient cloak for co-&#xD;
quetry)'&#xD;
Valerie flushed hotly. Perhaps con-&#xD;
science had something to say on this score&#xD;
-at least she drew herself back from his&#xD;
embrace, and there was a ring of defiance in&#xD;
her voice as she asked-&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
"What should I mean excepting what I&#xD;
have said?" he answered, quietly. "You&#xD;
must certainly see that I am right. There&#xD;
would be much less of disgraceful flirtation&#xD;
in this particular, if engagement were hero&#xD;
esteemed the public and binding contract&#xD;
which older states of society consider it.&#xD;
However, that is a question for moralists,&#xD;
not for me. The point now is, that I should&#xD;
think poorly indeed of any woman who en-&#xD;
tered into a secret engagement, and that I&#xD;
cannot consent to see you fill such a posi-&#xD;
tion, even for a few days."&#xD;
"'Yet I think you might remember that&#xD;
my wishes are entitled to some regard," she&#xD;
said, half haughtily.&#xD;
"Entitled to every regard," he answered,&#xD;
so gently that she felt instantly ashamed of&#xD;
herself. "But surely you must admit that&#xD;
I am in the right."&#xD;
&#xD;
"No," she replied, perversely. "I do&#xD;
not admit that. But, even granting that you&#xD;
are, it is a trifling concession to make to me&#xD;
-as well as the first."&#xD;
There was a pause. They had each mo-&#xD;
mently grown more earnest, until now the&#xD;
strife of adverse wills had reached its point&#xD;
of issue. With a start, Darcy recognized&#xD;
this; with a start, he saw that Valerie's ob-&#xD;
stinacy and pride were enlisted against him.&#xD;
Something in her face-in the flushed cheek&#xD;
and compressed lip, reminded him, too, of&#xD;
the day when she had persisted in driving&#xD;
the thorough-breds; and he thought to him-&#xD;
self-as men of his stamp are always ready&#xD;
to think-that such a wilful, impetuous na-&#xD;
ture stood in strong need of the steady curb&#xD;
of authority. It was in his hand now, this&#xD;
curb, and should ho neglect to use it? Tru-&#xD;
ly he had not a thought of doing so. And&#xD;
yet, that last tone was very hard to resist.&#xD;
He rather evaded the direct question, when&#xD;
after a moment he said, gravely:&#xD;
"Valerie, tell me frankly, why you are&#xD;
so anxious for this."&#xD;
"I thought I had already told you," she&#xD;
answered-feeling herself blush in her own&#xD;
despite-" of what do you suspect me? Do&#xD;
you think I want to use this engagement as&#xD;
a convenient cloak for coquetry?"&#xD;
"I answered that question when I told&#xD;
you that I trusted you," he said. "No, I&#xD;
do not suspect you of any thing excepting&#xD;
caprice-caprice that is scarcely worthy of&#xD;
you, though. I have already told you why I&#xD;
wish to make this announcement at once-&#xD;
it is a mark of respect due to our friends-&#xD;
and the same reason mu~t l4ead my excuse&#xD;
for disregarding your first request."&#xD;
She looked at him steadily.&#xD;
"You mean that you do intend to disre-&#xD;
gard it?"&#xD;
lie answered as quietly but as firmly as&#xD;
ever: "What else can I mean, when I say&#xD;
that I think it is right?"&#xD;
There was silence ~for several minutes.&#xD;
The fountain filled up the pause with its&#xD;
fairy-like inpusic; and Darcy never knew&#xD;
what a fierce fight was meanwhile waged in&#xD;
the heart of this woman, who, had never be-&#xD;
fore known any one bold enough or strong&#xD;
enough to say her nay. It was a good thing&#xD;
&#xD;
that she had little of the pettiness of her&#xD;
sex about her; that in her nature-spoil~d&#xD;
though ithad been-there were many noble&#xD;
and generous depths; and that, above all,&#xD;
there was a capability of self-surrender and&#xD;
self-conquest only possible to the mould&#xD;
which, however-warped it may have become,&#xD;
is still the heroic. Some women would have&#xD;
taken refuge in pettish anger, others would&#xD;
have hardened into obstinate defiance,&#xD;
others again would have provoked still fur-&#xD;
ther the useless strife, but she did none of&#xD;
these things. She fought down her own&#xD;
struggling heart in silence, then looked up&#xD;
calmly and gravely, making no pretence of&#xD;
evading her defeat, but accepting it with a&#xD;
dignity that redeemed it from the character&#xD;
of defeat~&#xD;
"Let it be as you think best," she said,&#xD;
holding out her hand. "I too can trust.&#xD;
Only remember this thing, when I seem to&#xD;
you passionate and obstinate-in all my life,&#xD;
I have never given up my will before."&#xD;
He made no vow that she should never&#xD;
need to give it up again, for ho knew bet-&#xD;
ter. He accepted the sacrifice as freely as&#xD;
it was offered, and there was a very stately&#xD;
chivalry in the air with which he raised her&#xD;
hand to his lips, and the tone in which he&#xD;
answered:&#xD;
"And remember this of me - that I&#xD;
would sooner die than ask any thing of&#xD;
you for my own advantage or lie your&#xD;
injury.&#xD;
And so the light cloud parted and fled&#xD;
away, the broad sunlight came back, and&#xD;
what wonder that they basked in it to their&#xD;
hearts' content? What wonder that they&#xD;
let all points of past or future dispute rest&#xD;
untouched, and only dwelt on the present,&#xD;
only read over the opening chapter of that&#xD;
old romance whose first pages are ever so&#xD;
fair and tender, only whispered the old&#xD;
vows, and glided down the smooth stream,&#xD;
with ~iren strains echoing in their ears-&#xD;
strains so sweet that they efibetually dead-&#xD;
ened that dull, ominous roar of breakers&#xD;
ahead?&#xD;
Yet, when Valerie stood before her mir-&#xD;
ror that night and looked at her radiant&#xD;
face, shining lil~e a star out of the heavy&#xD;

&#xD;
masses of her unbound hair, a sudden, sharp&#xD;
pang seized her heart.&#xD;
"He talks of secret engagements, and of&#xD;
convenient cloaks for coquetry," she mur-&#xD;
mured. "What would he say, if he knew&#xD;
about Charley? What will he say when he&#xD;
does know? I ought to have told him to-&#xD;
night; but-I dared not. I am a coward,&#xD;
I know; but I dread so unutterably what&#xD;
he will think of me! I must not keep his&#xD;
love on false pretences, however. I must tell&#xD;
him-I will tell him to-morrow."&#xD;
To-morrow! How often we say that,&#xD;
when a resolution is taken, or a purpose de-&#xD;
signed, and how mockingly Fate laughs hack&#xD;
at us! To-morrow! As if time was in our&#xD;
,poor mortal hands, or as if; to the cowardly&#xD;
and procrastinating, there ever is a morrow!&#xD;
As if that word alone has not been the bane&#xD;
ofimore good intentions, and the death-knell&#xD;
of more noble actions, as if it does not stand&#xD;
for more harm, and ill, and suffering, than&#xD;
any other common to the lips of man! Yet&#xD;
dream on, Valerie !-quiet your conscience&#xD;
with that cunning salve, call back the sun-&#xD;
ny smile to your lip, and, as you sink off to&#xD;
sleep, murmur again, "I will tell him to-&#xD;
morrow." Yen mean what you say-you&#xD;
intend it honestly and sincerely, for it is not&#xD;
in you to intend otherwise; but many be-,&#xD;
fore you have waked to the bitter knowl-&#xD;
edge that, in a world of deeds, acts resolved&#xD;
can never stand for acts executed; and that,&#xD;
while you whisper to yourself; "To-mor-&#xD;
row," one of the veiled sisters grimly an-&#xD;
swers:&#xD;
"But will that to-morrow ever be?"&#xD;
CHAPTEI~ IV.&#xD;
TIlE POEFEIT PLEDGE.&#xD;
"I HAVE been waiting for you some&#xD;
time, Valerie," said M. Vacquant, a little&#xD;
impatiently, as his granddaughter made her&#xD;
rather late appearance the next morning.&#xD;
"When you have breakfasted, I want to see&#xD;
Maurice and yourself in the library."&#xD;
He left the room abruptly, scarcely wait-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing for her surprised assent; and then she&#xD;
turned to Darcy, who was quite alone in&#xD;
possession of the breakfast-table.&#xD;
"So you have told him already!" she&#xD;
said, reproachfully. "But why does he&#xD;
want me?"&#xD;
Maurice shook his head smilingly. "I&#xD;
have not told him," he answered; "and&#xD;
whatever he wants with you must necessa-&#xD;
rily be quite apart from the matter which it&#xD;
has pleased you to make a secret."&#xD;
"What is it, then?"&#xD;
"I cannot even eonjeeture.~~&#xD;
"Very singular," said Miss Aylmer; but&#xD;
she said it composedly, and sat down qui-&#xD;
etly to her breakfast. Whatever M. Vac-&#xD;
quant wanted was certainly not to be com-&#xD;
pared in importance to her cup of coffee, or&#xD;
to the admiring eyes that told her over and&#xD;
over again how lovely she looked. Perhaps&#xD;
the task of telling her so would not have&#xD;
fallen entirely upon the eyes, expressive&#xD;
though they were, if that obtuse Gilbert&#xD;
had not stood so steadily upon guard with a&#xD;
salver under his arm. But, as it was, Darcy&#xD;
had to content himself with reading aloud&#xD;
the telegrams from the Gazette, while Va-&#xD;
lerie trifled with a roll, and talked politics&#xD;
in a tone that redeemed even politics from&#xD;
dryness.&#xD;
The telegrams and politics could not last&#xD;
forever, though; and after a while she said,&#xD;
with a sigh of resignation, "I suppose we&#xD;
must go to grandpapa now."&#xD;
"Yes~~~ Darcy answered; and, pushing&#xD;
back the paper, he came round the table&#xD;
and offered her his arm. She took it half&#xD;
laughingly-no thought coming to her of&#xD;
how once before, in that very place, she had&#xD;
accepted Julian Romney's-and then they&#xD;
proceeded out of the room, crossed the hall,&#xD;
and entered the library.&#xD;
M. Vacquant was already there-was&#xD;
already settled in his own chair beside the&#xD;
cabinet where his letters were always writ-&#xD;
ten-the chair, the purple-velvet lining of&#xD;
which brought out with the clearness of an&#xD;
ancient cameo his fine, regular outline of&#xD;
face and crest of silver curls. He nodded&#xD;
kindly but gravely as the two came in, and&#xD;
motioned them to sit down. Then, while&#xD;
they did so, he opened a drawer at his side,&#xD;
&#xD;
drew forth a folded paper, and held it in h&#xD;
hand when he turned round again.&#xD;
".3Ies en~fanta," he said, in his state~&#xD;
courteous way, "I have summoned you i&#xD;
this formal manner because I consider&#xD;
right that you should be informed together&#xD;
and not apart, of my final intentions towar&#xD;
you. In the order of  ~ature, I cannot cx&#xD;
pect to live much longer, and the conflicting!&#xD;
claims of you two have been the cause ol&#xD;
much uneasiness and the sul~ject of mud&#xD;
thought to me. At last, however, I hav4&#xD;
arrived at a decision; and I am anxious P&#xD;
explain my reasons for it, since it may seen&#xD;
to you-to one of you, at least-not onl~&#xD;
capricious, but unjust. Valerie, you hav(&#xD;
been reared so entirely as my heiress, thai&#xD;
a bequeathment which gives to you only a&#xD;
share of the inheritance, may seem to you&#xD;
like a wrong. Therefore-"&#xD;
"Grandpapa," Valerie interposed, re-&#xD;
proachfully, "I hope you would have&#xD;
spared me this. I hoped you would believe&#xD;
that I am willing, even anxious, for you to&#xD;
make that disposition of your property&#xD;
which seems to you best."&#xD;
" I do believe you, petite," he said,&#xD;
kindly. "I am sure those are your senti-&#xD;
ments now. But there are others who would&#xD;
neither think nor feel as you do, and who,&#xD;
as time went on, might persuade you that&#xD;
you had been hardly dealt with."&#xD;
"If you mean papa or Eugene~~~ began&#xD;
Miss Ayliner, a little indignantly; but she&#xD;
was cut short very summarily.&#xD;
"Ohut I" said the old Frenchman, in his&#xD;
French fashion. "Of course 12 don't mean&#xD;
either of them. Your father does not value&#xD;
money more than most men of the world&#xD;
do; and, as for your brother, unless he has&#xD;
changed very much, he values it consider-&#xD;
ably less than is either wise or expedient.&#xD;
I was thinking principally of your future&#xD;
husband-for I suppose you will find one&#xD;
some day"&#xD;
Valerie smilei1t s~uelly~ "Most people&#xD;
do, grandpapa. But y~u may be sure of one&#xD;
thing-he will not quarrel with your testa-&#xD;
mentary arrangements."&#xD;
"Who can foretell that, petite? "said he.&#xD;
"And there is no doubt of~one thing-the&#xD;
fact of your having been taught to expect&#xD;
&#xD;
.CiJJ!JV~J~j.                  139&#xD;
is this inheritance would render a different&#xD;
disposition of it an undoubted wrong on my&#xD;
r, part, if I had not sufficient reason for what&#xD;
n I do."&#xD;
it His granddaughter bent forward, and&#xD;
; laid her hand over the one which rested on&#xD;
ri the arm of his chair.&#xD;
"I am sure of it, grandpapa," she said,&#xD;
~ gently; "and, once for all, trust me that I&#xD;
1' shall be perfectly content with that disposi-&#xD;
i tion, whatever it may be."&#xD;
He smiled slightly, gratefully it seemed,&#xD;
and then retained her hand, holding it in&#xD;
1 his own, and smoothing it down with a ten~&#xD;
der sort of caress, while he turned to Darcy&#xD;
and spoke abruptly:&#xD;
"Maurice, you have been so 'immovable&#xD;
in your resolution to accept nothing from&#xD;
me, that I am forced to urge upon you the&#xD;
last appeal which one generous mind can&#xD;
make to another. Do not deny me the poor&#xD;
satisfaction of making all the atonement&#xD;
possible for a sin which I have bitterly re-&#xD;
pented-that of making reparation to you&#xD;
for the wrong 12 4id your mother. That&#xD;
wrong was deeper than you or any one else&#xD;
ever supposed."&#xD;
Darcy started, and his face hardened&#xD;
suddenly and strangely, as Valerie had often&#xD;
noticed; it was apt tQ harden at any men-&#xD;
tion of his mother's name.&#xD;
"That plea had best be left untouched,&#xD;
sir," he said, coldly. "I fear that, if you per-&#xD;
sist in urging it, I shall only proi~e that I&#xD;
have not a 'generous mind.' I do not admit&#xD;
that you possess any right or any power&#xD;
of reparation for her wrongs, and I would&#xD;
rather not speak of them under this roof."&#xD;
"You mean that you cannot forgive&#xD;
them?"&#xD;
"I mean that I cannot forget how she&#xD;
died, in want and privation, while her for~&#xD;
tune was withheld from her."&#xD;
The elder man did not shrink as this an-&#xD;
swer fell on his ear. Perhaps his own con-&#xD;
science had uttered it too often for human&#xD;
lips to give the words added force. He&#xD;
only looked up with an unconscious pathos&#xD;
which touched his granddaughter to the&#xD;
quick, and made her turn one keenly-re-&#xD;
proachful glance on Darcy.&#xD;
"You are right," he said. "Even more&#xD;

&#xD;
right than you think. I have always meant&#xD;
to tell you the story, and you might as well&#xD;
hear it now. It is not very long. You&#xD;
know already how entirely your mother&#xD;
was left in my power by our father's will;&#xD;
how, according to that will, all her proper-&#xD;
ty reverted to me if she married without&#xD;
my consent; you know also how bitterly I&#xD;
opposed her marriage with your father; how,&#xD;
when she persisted in marrying himI carried&#xD;
into effect the condition of the will; how,&#xD;
from the hour in which she took the name&#xD;
of Darcy, I refused to see or hold any com-&#xD;
munication with her. But you do not know,&#xD;
nor did she or any one else, save myself, that&#xD;
this stern condition was only intended by my&#xD;
father to guard against a danger to which he&#xD;
considered women especially liable-the dan-&#xD;
ger of ill-advised marriage. He thought he&#xD;
might thus prevent Aim6e from throwing&#xD;
herself away; but he never intended that,&#xD;
even in such a case, her inheritance should&#xD;
really be forfeited. It was a species of se-&#xD;
cret trust; and the last thing he said to me&#xD;
before he died was, 'Deml gently with your&#xD;
sister."'&#xD;
He stopped abruptly at this point-evi-&#xD;
dently more from agitation than because he&#xD;
desired any comment or reply-so, for a mo-&#xD;
ment, all was silence in the room. Valerie&#xD;
heard his quick breathing, as he strove to&#xD;
regain composure; but she could not see&#xD;
his face, partly because of her own position,&#xD;
partly because he sat with his back to the&#xD;
light. But that light shone full on Dar-&#xD;
cy's face, and it was not a pleasant or&#xD;
encouraging sight to either gazer. All the&#xD;
genial expression had faded from it; the&#xD;
clear eyes looked cold and dark; the frank&#xD;
features set and stern; while over the whole&#xD;
there broqded less of anger than of chill,&#xD;
hard severity. Valerie looked at him ap-&#xD;
prehensively, almost imploringly, but he&#xD;
scarcelyy seemed to see her; he scarcely&#xD;
seemed conscious of the dread which was&#xD;
upon her. It was a relief when at last M.&#xD;
Yacquant resumed, still steadily and grave-&#xD;
ly addressing himself to Maurice:&#xD;
"It is only due to myself that I should&#xD;
assure you that the love of money did not&#xD;
influence me in the course which I pur-&#xD;
sued. I disliked your father prom the first,&#xD;
&#xD;
and I never forgave your mother many bit-&#xD;
ter and scornful things which she said to me&#xD;
before she left my house. Concerning the&#xD;
first, he was your father, and he has gone&#xD;
before me to the bar of a higher judgment,&#xD;
so I need say nothing as to the grounds of&#xD;
my dislike, save that they afforded me good&#xD;
cause for opposing the marriage, as even&#xD;
you may be aware, from your knowledge of&#xD;
his character. He was the most reckless,&#xD;
the most incorrigible spendthrift I ever&#xD;
knew-though not a fortune-hunter, as in&#xD;
my anger I called him at the time. Perhaps&#xD;
this charge incensed your mother more than&#xD;
any thing else. At all events, it rendered&#xD;
her more obstinate than ever; and she mar-&#xD;
ried him. I was very hot and passionate in&#xD;
those days. I vowed to make both of them&#xD;
feel the weight of my anger; and, to do so,&#xD;
I violated the trust of the dead."&#xD;
Another silent pause-a pause in which&#xD;
Valerie looked again wistfully at the un-&#xD;
moved face before her-and then the speaker&#xD;
once more ~vent on:&#xD;
"I have forced myself to this painful&#xD;
statement for two reasons: first, because I&#xD;
want to prove to you, Valerie, that if I do&#xD;
not make you the great heiress you once ex-&#xD;
pected to be, it is only by the interposition&#xD;
of something which is at once a reparation&#xD;
and a duty; and, secondly, I wish to con-&#xD;
vince you, Maurice, that you accept not my&#xD;
bounty, but your mother's right."&#xD;
He looked at Darcy, as he spoke, with a&#xD;
deprecating entreaty that was as painful as&#xD;
it was strange.' It must have touched the&#xD;
younger man, for his face softened some-&#xD;
what, and his voice sounded more gentle&#xD;
than Valerie had dared to hope it would,&#xD;
when he answered:&#xD;
"The past is past, sir. Surely we need&#xD;
not dig from its ashes the bitter and pain-&#xD;
ful memories that still remain there. I have'&#xD;
not forgotten my mother's last words, which&#xD;
charged me to forgive you; and that I break&#xD;
your bread, is proof enough of my having&#xD;
done so. We need not dwell on the nature&#xD;
of her wrongs. It is too late now to do her&#xD;
justice; and your present duty is not to me,&#xD;
but to those who possess the nearest claim&#xD;
on you."&#xD;
"It is to you," said NI. Vacquant, almost&#xD;
&#xD;
sternly. "You talk of forgiveness, and yet&#xD;
wish to send me down to the grave with the&#xD;
burden of an unexpiated sin upon my con-&#xD;
science-a sin that has outlawed me from&#xD;
God and His Church these many years?&#xD;
Hush! hush!" he uplifted his hand, as&#xD;
Darcy strove to speak. "I will not hear&#xD;
another word. Talk as you will-refuse&#xD;
what you will-after I am dead. Nothing&#xD;
shall induce me to alter one line of this&#xD;
paper which I hold here-my will."&#xD;
His will! They both looked at it with&#xD;
something of awe; that paper concerning&#xD;
which there had been so much of conjec-&#xD;
ture and more of scheming than either of&#xD;
them dreamed; that gave away into other&#xD;
hands the wealth for which its owner had&#xD;
so sinned and suffered; that would deal a&#xD;
death-blow to so many hopes, and gratify&#xD;
scarcely any! Ah! surely that must be a&#xD;
bitter hour to a man who has loved the&#xD;
world, and the possessions of the world,&#xD;
when he comes at last to say, "I do hereby&#xD;
give and bequeath;" when absolutely and&#xD;
irrevocably he bestows upon others all that&#xD;
has been the delight of earth to him, and&#xD;
goes forth naked and stripped, as the poorest&#xD;
pauper, to face the everlasting justice of&#xD;
God! Meanwhile, M. Vacquant slowly un-&#xD;
folded the large sheet which he held, and&#xD;
taking up his gold eye-glass began to read.&#xD;
aloud. The will was by no means ~ long&#xD;
document, and, shorn of all its legal tech-&#xD;
nicalities, might have been briefly stated&#xD;
thus:&#xD;
First came the minor bequests; old ser-&#xD;
vants were pensioned oft; and old friends re-&#xD;
merabered. Then-&#xD;
To his wife, Marian Vacquant, in token&#xD;
of "affectionate regard," the interest of&#xD;
one hundred thousand dollars, and the&#xD;
use of the town-house during her natural&#xD;
life.&#xD;
To his son-in-law, Gerald Aylmer, the&#xD;
sum of one hundred thousand dollars.&#xD;
To his step-son, J2ulian Itomney, the sum&#xD;
of twenty-five thousand dollars.&#xD;
To his young friend and connection, Eu-&#xD;
gene Aylmer, the sum of twenty-five thou-&#xD;
sand dollars.&#xD;
The large bulk of the fortune (eight&#xD;
hundred thousand dollars, clear of all be-&#xD;
&#xD;
quests) was left jointly to his granddaugh-&#xD;
ter, Valerie Aylmer, and his nephew, Mau-&#xD;
rice Darcy, on condition of their marrying&#xD;
each other-in case of either refusing to do&#xD;
so, Valerie Aylmer inherited three hundred&#xD;
thousand dollars, and Maurice Darcy the&#xD;
half million remaining.&#xD;
To the reading of this document ensued&#xD;
a profound silence. Considered from her&#xD;
point of view, it was not Valerie Aylmer's&#xD;
place to speak-besides, she had already&#xD;
signified her assent to any thing; and Darcy&#xD;
also held his peace; so, after waiting some&#xD;
little time, M. Vacquant was the first to&#xD;
break the silence.&#xD;
"I. am afraid that this compromise, like&#xD;
most compromises, has only succeeded in&#xD;
pleasing nobody; but I hope you both com-&#xD;
prehend, and do justice to my reasons for&#xD;
making it. I have no hope that you will&#xD;
eithe~ of you accept the condition which&#xD;
would render my double duty so plain, but&#xD;
I thought it right to afford you the option of&#xD;
doing so. I hope and believe-"&#xD;
But what he hoped and believed was&#xD;
left to conjecture; for, as he paused, with a&#xD;
somewhat troubled look, Darcy rose, and&#xD;
came forward to Valerie's side. He took&#xD;
her hand, and then spoke with an air of&#xD;
very quiet and self-possessed deference.&#xD;
"Sir," he said, "you may be glad to&#xD;
hear that we have anticipated your kind in-&#xD;
tention toward us; that once more a Darcy&#xD;
sues for the hand of the daughter of your&#xD;
house; and that he needs only your consent&#xD;
to call it his own."&#xD;
M. Vacquant started, and, for the space&#xD;
of at least a minute, gazed at th'em-at his&#xD;
granddaughter's blushing face and his neph-&#xD;
ew's proud dignity-in mute amazement.&#xD;
Then he said, slowly-&#xD;
"Mes enfants, is this true?"&#xD;
"It is perfectly true," Maurice answered~&#xD;
gravely. "Henceforth, there will be no&#xD;
m~eed of compromise or division, for any in-&#xD;
terests of ~&#xD;
Another minute N!. Yacquant was si-&#xD;
lent-striving perhaps to realize this unex-&#xD;
pected stroke of Fortune-but at last he said,&#xD;
solemnly:&#xD;
"Maurice Darcy, I owe your father's&#xD;
memory a great debt. Pray for me that&#xD;

142                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                          THE FORFEIT PLEDGE.                    143&#xD;
&#xD;
this may be received as some small pay&#xD;
ment of it, and-God bless you both, m~&#xD;
dears!"&#xD;
Ten minutes after that, Valerie had lef&#xD;
her grandfather and Darcy together in th4&#xD;
library, and was walking toward Alix's roon&#xD;
with a very sunny smile on her face, when&#xD;
at a turn of the corridor, she suddenly en&#xD;
countered Romney. Remembering his re&#xD;
pulse of the night before, she was about t&#xD;
pass him with a single bend of the head,&#xD;
but he paused before her, and held out hi~&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Forgive me," he said, "and-tell m~&#xD;
so."&#xD;
"I have nothingto forgive," she answered&#xD;
cprdially. "But I am very glad to see you&#xD;
back again; and I hope you mean to remain&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Youhope so?"&#xD;
"Indeed I do, most sincerely."&#xD;
"Without thinking what it would cost&#xD;
me, or without caring-which I"&#xD;
"Hoping that, after a very little while, it&#xD;
would not cost you any thing," she saifi, de-&#xD;
termined not to heed his tone. "Ah, Julian,&#xD;
we shall part soon, never perhaps to meet&#xD;
again-can we not be friends?"&#xD;
Some violent reply seemed to tremble on&#xD;
his lip, but he controlled it; and, after a&#xD;
moment, answered quietly, with only a&#xD;
quick gleam in his eyes:&#xD;
"I told you once that we could never be&#xD;
friends. But the last month has taught me&#xD;
that I can be any thing save your enemy,&#xD;
do any thing save remain away from you.&#xD;
If you wi{l, promise to teach me friendship&#xD;
half as well as you taught me love, I might~&#xD;
after all, prove an apt pupil."&#xD;
"You will try at least?"&#xD;
"Yes, I will try-as others have tried in&#xD;
the past. But perhaps my success may prove&#xD;
as indifferent as theirs."&#xD;
She looked at him in surprise. "What&#xD;
do you mean?"&#xD;
"I mean," he said, "what I should not&#xD;
have forgotten-only you make me forget&#xD;
every thing--that one of these 'friends' is&#xD;
waiting with for his you and here&#xD;
&#xD;
He gave it to her, watching with a smile,&#xD;
~ which it was well she did not see, her grow-&#xD;
ing paleness, as she read on the bit of card-&#xD;
board the familiar autograph "Charles Ver-&#xD;
t non Hautaine."&#xD;
For a moment, a dark mist came over her&#xD;
1 sight, and a choking sensation rose up in her&#xD;
throat. The impulse of physical cowardice&#xD;
- rushed over her, as it had never done before&#xD;
- in all her life; and if it had not been for the&#xD;
gaze fixed on her-the gaze whose malice&#xD;
she instinctively felt-she would have fled&#xD;
away anywhere, for a little respite, a little&#xD;
time to consider what was best to be done.&#xD;
But it was no part of Julian's policy to al-&#xD;
low that; and his voice broke now on her&#xD;
ear.&#xD;
"The absent are said to be always&#xD;
* wrong-I shall certainly begin to believe&#xD;
that they are always unwelcome, if you give&#xD;
your friend's card no warmer glance than&#xD;
that. What is the matter I"&#xD;
Valerie raised her head haughtily. The&#xD;
tone was even more significant than the&#xD;
glance, and both together acted on her like&#xD;
a restorative. Whatever she felt, Whatever&#xD;
she feared, this man should see neither. So&#xD;
she looked at him, as she answered, very&#xD;
coldly and nonchalantly:&#xD;
"You are mistaken. The absent are&#xD;
never either wrong or unwelcome with me&#xD;
-especially such a dear old friend as Mr.&#xD;
Hautaine. If I hesitated over his card, it&#xD;
was simply because I was very much sur-&#xD;
prised. I did not know he was in Balti-&#xD;
more. I must go down to him at once. Will&#xD;
you please let me pass?"&#xD;
He moved aside at once; but continued&#xD;
to stand at the head of the stairs, watching&#xD;
her as she descended, watching h~r as she&#xD;
swept in her soft violet draperies across the&#xD;
hall, watching her as she opened the draw-&#xD;
ing-room door, watching the panel even&#xD;
after it had closed upon her, with the same&#xD;
smile on his face.&#xD;
He was still standing there, when a hand&#xD;
was laid gently on his arm, and his mother's&#xD;
voice spoke:&#xD;
"Has she gone down?"&#xD;
He did not look round, but the smile&#xD;
faded from his face, and its quick, stormy&#xD;
frown came over it, as he answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, she has gone down, to play off he&#xD;
fooleries on that poor devil. Your work wil&#xD;
be done, if you wrn only find an excuse foi&#xD;
sending the new l9ver in upon them aboul&#xD;
a quarter of an hour hence. He may be sc&#xD;
far gone he won't mind any thing of the son&#xD;
-curse him I-but if he does care, she can'I&#xD;
make matters straight-granting they told&#xD;
even half the truth about this affair down in&#xD;
Louisiana."&#xD;
With that he turned and descended the&#xD;
staircase, passing with a scowl by the draw.&#xD;
ing-room, and out of the front door into the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
Meanwhile Valerie had gone down armed&#xD;
with the courage of desperation, shrinking&#xD;
in spirit like the veriest coward, but out-&#xD;
wardly perfect in bravery and composure,&#xD;
as she moved forward under Julian's eye;&#xD;
even when she put ~r hand on the lock&#xD;
of the drawing-room or, when she opened&#xD;
it, when she stood within the threshold,&#xD;
when there came eagerly hastening to meet&#xD;
her the same impetuous, handsome cavalier,&#xD;
with hazel eyes and sunny curls, from whom&#xD;
she had parted six months before. He was&#xD;
so entirely himself, so wholly unchanged in&#xD;
look or manner, that, for the moment, all&#xD;
her fear and embarrassment fled away, and&#xD;
she saw only the intimate companion of&#xD;
years; the boy-lover with whom she had&#xD;
flirted and quarrelled eVer since they were&#xD;
children together; the man whose brave,&#xD;
bright, generous nature had always pos-&#xD;
sessed such a rare attraction for her, whom&#xD;
she liked to the very boundary of love, and&#xD;
who brought all the breath of home, all the&#xD;
soft skies and golden days with him, in the&#xD;
first tone of his frank, clear voice, the first&#xD;
grasp of his loyal, gallant hand.&#xD;
Their greeting was every thing that the&#xD;
greeting of such old friends had a right to b~,&#xD;
and then Valerie swept into oblivion the&#xD;
awkward issues of the awkward present, and&#xD;
looked at her slave with much of the old&#xD;
arch smile.&#xD;
"ifercil how much~ you are improved!"&#xD;
she cried. "Is it Paris that has made you&#xD;
so irresistibly handsome?"&#xD;
"Paris!" he repeated, as he tossed back,&#xD;
with a well-remembered gesture, the graceful&#xD;
curls which many fair ladies had secretly&#xD;
&#xD;
* envied him. "I flatter myself that even&#xD;
I Paris could not improve me! The thing is,&#xD;
belle arnie, that you had forgotten how good-&#xD;
looking I am."&#xD;
"At least I had not forgotten how im-&#xD;
pudent you are," she rejoined, laughingly.&#xD;
"It is certainly out of the power of Paris,&#xD;
I or 'anywhere else, for that matter, to im-&#xD;
prove you in self-conceit. Come, sit down,&#xD;
and tell me all about yourself and your trav-&#xD;
els. Do you know I heard that you had&#xD;
* gone to Constantinople, to enlist in the&#xD;
Turkish army?"&#xD;
"You might have heard many more im-~&#xD;
probable things," he answered, taking a seat&#xD;
beside her own. "I am a sworn free com-&#xD;
panion now, and there is no telling where I&#xD;
may find myself some day. You know my&#xD;
motto:&#xD;
'La guerre eat ma patrie,&#xD;
Mon harnols ma mason,&#xD;
Et en toute season&#xD;
Combattre c'est ma vie I'"&#xD;
"In that case, I don't see what brought&#xD;
you back to America," said his listener, with&#xD;
a shrug. "There is no field for such a creed&#xD;
here-a creed, em passant, which merits and&#xD;
receives my full approbation."&#xD;
"You wonder-Valerie, ?,'ou?"&#xD;
As may be imagined, the tone of this&#xD;
question warned La belle des belles that she&#xD;
had ventured on dangerous ground. She&#xD;
smiled-then frowned-then blushed, and&#xD;
finally changed the subject abruptly, by&#xD;
asking "if he had seen Eugene in France?"&#xD;
Perhaps Hautaine was not overmuch&#xD;
pleased by this transition; but at least he&#xD;
submitted to it with a good grace. He an-&#xD;
swered in the affirmative, and went on to&#xD;
describe various particulars concerning&#xD;
young Ayhner, who was one of a corps of&#xD;
civil engineers engaged in surveying a rail-&#xD;
road in the south of France. He assured&#xD;
the somewhat incredulous sister that the&#xD;
young Confederate accepted his changed po-&#xD;
sition with very perfect philosophy, laughed&#xD;
refining to the winds, with the gay fortitude&#xD;
of his light-hearted race, professed to prefer&#xD;
civil engineering to the kindred military sci-&#xD;
ence which had been his profession, and to&#xD;
find surveying railroads more agreeable than&#xD;
planning fortifications. Then he told her&#xD;
&#xD;

144                      VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
something of his social triumphs, how the&#xD;
fair Farisiennes called him Le beau Con-&#xD;
f&amp;amp;Z~r~, how much he had improved in cool-&#xD;
ness of head and steadiness of purpose, and&#xD;
how many friends were ready and willing to&#xD;
sound his praises, even in the strange land&#xD;
where he had gone with only a brave heart&#xD;
and a strong arm to aid him in the fight for&#xD;
fortune.&#xD;
Valerie looked up with kindling eyes.&#xD;
"You can't tell l~ow glad I am to know&#xD;
this!" she said. "My poor, gallant boy!&#xD;
I was almost the only one who encouraged&#xD;
him to cast his fortunes abroad, and who&#xD;
bade him God-speed when he went. So I&#xD;
feel as if half the responsibility of his suc-&#xD;
cess or failure rested on me. Papa only&#xD;
half agreed, and Gerald was bitterly op-&#xD;
posed to anything so far out of the ordinary&#xD;
routine of planting cotton or practicing law."&#xD;
Hautaine laughed.&#xD;
"Gerald certainly will never swell the&#xD;
ranks of condottieri," he said.&#xD;
"No," Valerie answered, with some-&#xD;
thing like a curl of her lip. "Gerald was&#xD;
made for his own groove; and I don't know&#xD;
what would become of him if he was taken&#xD;
out of it. He was born to be a planter at&#xD;
Aylmers, and a planter at Aylmers he is&#xD;
still determined to be, although every thing&#xD;
that made the life pleasant- has forever&#xD;
passed away. He is a good specimen of a&#xD;
certain class of the men of the day-the ad-&#xD;
vocates of expediency-who are ready to&#xD;
make the best of any thing, even of their&#xD;
country's dishonor."&#xD;
"Yes," said Hautaine, absently; for he&#xD;
had not come all the distance which lies&#xD;
between Paris and Baltimore, to talk over&#xD;
this oft-discussed subject. "But then," he&#xD;
added, suddenly,, "Gerald may be right,&#xD;
after all-Who knows? Sometimes I feel&#xD;
terribly uncertain whether I may not be in&#xD;
the wrong path - whether there is not a&#xD;
duty to one's country when she is down, as&#xD;
well as when she is up; whether-"&#xD;
He stopped short, for Valerie was look-&#xD;
ing at him in grieved surprise.&#xD;
"Et tu, Brute!" she said, reproachful-&#xD;
ly. "I never expected to hear such soph-&#xD;
istry, and-if you will pardon the word&#xD;
-such cant, from your lips, Charley.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wrong! wrong to consult your own self-&#xD;
respect, after having done all for your coun-&#xD;
try that an honest man could do !-after&#xD;
having fought for her to the last gasp, and&#xD;
gone with her down into the depths of hu-&#xD;
miliation and despair !-wrong to fly from&#xD;
her shame, though you shared her suffer-&#xD;
ing! Tell me this-what could you, do for&#xD;
her if you. remained? As she ishow can the&#xD;
bravest heart that ever breathed, the stout-&#xD;
est arm that ever dealt blow, help her in&#xD;
her bitter servitude? And how can you&#xD;
even help yourself? What path of manly&#xD;
enterprise is there which you do not need to&#xD;
enter with a lie on your lip, and at the door&#xD;
of which you do not leave all the honor&#xD;
of rectitude that is half-religion to the men'&#xD;
of our race? True, you might abjure all&#xD;
public paths-you might stay here and eat&#xD;
out your heart in obscurity:, a constant wit-&#xD;
ness of all the treachery and corruption that&#xD;
is rampant; but would that help the poor&#xD;
patrie? No, Charley, no! Go and save&#xD;
yourself from all that must be learned in&#xD;
such an atmosphere! Go with a true heart,&#xD;
and a clear conscience-for I cannot do you&#xD;
the injustice to doubt one thing-when your&#xD;
country needs you, you will be at her call."&#xD;
He looked up at her with a gaze of hon-&#xD;
est admiration. For a moment she had for-&#xD;
gotten every thing save the sore wound&#xD;
which still bled in her inmost heart, as it&#xD;
bleeds and will ever bleed in that of every&#xD;
woman of her race. For a moment the&#xD;
same old fire leaped into her eyes that had&#xD;
quickened them when she spoke brave&#xD;
words of cheer to the gallant hearts thathad&#xD;
gathered under the Red-Cross banner, and,&#xD;
for a moment, something of the old ringing&#xD;
eloquence rushed to her lips, which in those&#xD;
days had shamed even cowards while they&#xD;
listened to her. She looked like an inspired&#xD;
sibyl, as she uttered her last "Go," and he&#xD;
who. listened was only too ready to heed&#xD;
the oracle.&#xD;
"You are right," lie said, quickly~ "In-&#xD;
deed, I never doubt or hesitate, excepting&#xD;
in some moments of depression and dis-&#xD;
couragement, when I do Dot see my way&#xD;
very clearly; for I have not an available&#xD;
profession that can be turned to civil use,&#xD;
like that of Eugene."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FORFI&#xD;
"Are youtired of the sea?"&#xD;
"Yes," lie said, with a sudden shadow&#xD;
falling over his face. "Besides, Icoi4d only&#xD;
turn pirate, or enter some merchant-service&#xD;
-and both of those paths are liable to ob-&#xD;
jections. I think I shall turn my ambition&#xD;
in a military direction. Austria has always&#xD;
given a cordial welcome to soldiers of for-&#xD;
tune. I have a strong inclination to go&#xD;
there. Tell me what you think of it?"&#xD;
"I think very well of it," she answered,&#xD;
gayly. "The uniform is said to be the hand-&#xD;
5~mestin Europe, and I can fancy you a count&#xD;
of the empire, with a marshal's baton, and&#xD;
a Theresian cross."&#xD;
He laughed slightly, then bent forward&#xD;
and laid his lips on her hand.&#xD;
"It all depends on you," he said, quickly.&#xD;
"You know what I am here for. You know&#xD;
the promise you gave me six months ago.&#xD;
I have tried not to hope too much, but I&#xD;
cannot believe that you doom me to such&#xD;
long waiting-only for disappointment. I&#xD;
am here for your decision, and I tell you&#xD;
now, what I told you before-take me and&#xD;
my ambition, and make them both what you&#xD;
will."&#xD;
"I cannot believe that you doomed me&#xD;
to such long waiting-only for disappoint-&#xD;
ment." Out of all his speech those were&#xD;
the words that rang in Valerie's ears like&#xD;
the voice of an accusing angel. He could&#xD;
not believe it ~f her; and yet-it was what&#xD;
she had done! What matter that she had&#xD;
done it ignorantly, carelessly, even thinking&#xD;
it for the best, when the bitter result was&#xD;
now staring her in the face? Yet she dared&#xD;
not hesitate-each moment of longer wait-*&#xD;
ing was a deeper wrong-so she looked at&#xD;
the man, whom her promise had brought&#xD;
across the broad Atlantic, with a gaze that&#xD;
told him his sentence even before her lips&#xD;
uttered it, and answered almost mechani-&#xD;
cally:&#xD;
"I was wrong, Charley, and-mistaken.&#xD;
I hoped to spare you this. I meant to have&#xD;
written to you, and told you what I have&#xD;
known for some time-that I do not love&#xD;
you well enough to marry you."&#xD;
She spoke these few sentences so coldly&#xD;
and formally, so much like a lesson learned&#xD;
by rote, that it was no wonder Hautaine&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
E~IT PLEDGE.                       145&#xD;
looked at her in mute, sorrowful amaze.&#xD;
There was silence for a moment, and then&#xD;
he uttered only one word-&#xD;
"Valerie!"&#xD;
The sound of her own name, spoken out&#xD;
of the very depths of his wounded, loving&#xD;
heart, touched her deeply. She looked up&#xD;
with an almost pitiful entreaty in her eyes.&#xD;
"Oh, Charley, dear friend, try to forgive&#xD;
me! I never meant to treat you so! I&#xD;
never meant any thing so utterly heartless&#xD;
and shameful! I thought-indeed, I thought&#xD;
-that I loved you; but I find I do not, save&#xD;
as the best and kindest brother. You would&#xD;
not accept that love from your wife? You&#xD;
would not__ "&#xD;
"I wcmld accept any thing in the world&#xD;
that gave me you," he interrupted, hastily.&#xD;
"If your refusal is based on the fear that&#xD;
you do not love me enZ)ugh-Oh, Valerie,&#xD;
never hesitate. Come to me, and trust the&#xD;
rest with time and with me. Or wait, if you&#xD;
would rather do that. I am willing to be&#xD;
your bondsman six years instead of six&#xD;
months, with hope to lighten the way. Do&#xD;
any thing, sooner than put an end to every&#xD;
expectation that has been my life. For&#xD;
Heaven's sake, think of what you sayl-for&#xD;
Heaven's sake, remember what you mean!"&#xD;
He spoke eagerly and passionately, spoke&#xD;
*with a force and pathos which showed Vale-&#xD;
rie plainly how much deeper was the disap-&#xD;
pointment now than before Hope had been&#xD;
whispering her siren song for months; be-&#xD;
fore he had almost felt and owned her-his.&#xD;
Then out of the depths of her bitter humil-&#xD;
ity came a great cry:&#xD;
"Oh, Charley, Charley, believe me it is&#xD;
best so. Believe me, we are not, we never&#xD;
could be, suited to each other. Oh, it grieves~&#xD;
me to the heart to think that I have seemed&#xD;
to trifle so wantonly with you-.-to remem-&#xD;
ber that I might have saved you all this, if r&#xD;
had only been honest and true, last fall-if&#xD;
I had only told you then what I am sure of&#xD;
now-that I can never, never love y~u well'&#xD;
enough to marry you."&#xD;
She repeated this as if it were her one~&#xD;
stronghold of defence, and he looked at her&#xD;
with a dark cloud that seenied like despair&#xD;
~thering over his face, as he said-&#xD;
"You have learned thissiacewe parted? "&#xD;

&#xD;
"Does it matter how I learned it, if it be&#xD;
true?"&#xD;
"And it is true?"&#xD;
She bent her head slowly. "It is true."&#xD;
There was nothing more to be said-&#xD;
nothing more to be urged. Hautaine seemed&#xD;
to feel this, for, after a moment, he spoke&#xD;
again, drearily enough:&#xD;
"Then there is nothing for me but to&#xD;
~&#xD;
"To go!" she repeated.&#xD;
"Yes-back to the life which you have&#xD;
made such an empty and useless thing.&#xD;
Don't think I mean to reproach you. It&#xD;
may not be' your fault, but-"&#xD;
She interrupted him passionately:&#xD;
"Not my fault? It is mine alone. Oh,&#xD;
Charley, if I could bear' s~ the suffering-&#xD;
yours as well as mine-I would n~t care so&#xD;
much. But it is the thought of you that&#xD;
breaks my heart-that makes me feel myself&#xD;
a wretch-that ahuost ,makes it a sin to&#xD;
be-"&#xD;
"Happy," she would have added, if her&#xD;
voicehadnotbroken down inarush of tears-&#xD;
a perfect thunder-shower 'of emotion. Poor&#xD;
Charley was fairly frightened at its vehe-&#xD;
mence, and did his honest best to soothe&#xD;
and comfort her, but with very little effect.&#xD;
Half from nervous agitatio; half from sin-&#xD;
cere self~reproach, she still wept on, and he&#xD;
was still bending over her, when the sound&#xD;
of an opening door made them both start&#xD;
-made Valerie look up through her tears,&#xD;
and Hautaine turn sharply 'round to see-&#xD;
Maurice Darcy framed on the threshold.&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
PAOE TO FAcE.&#xD;
IT was evident that he had only just&#xD;
entered-in time perhaps to hear Valerie's&#xD;
last words, but certainly not before; for, as&#xD;
she looked up, she caught his start of aston-&#xD;
ishment, and saw the same astonishment in&#xD;
his eyes as they glanced from herself to her&#xD;
companion6 Involuntarily, she was about&#xD;
to speak, to say something-any thing that&#xD;
would explain; butthe euddendarkening that&#xD;
&#xD;
came into those eyes, the sudden change&#xD;
that swept over his face-a change very&#xD;
much as if a stone mask had been fitted over&#xD;
the features-hushed all sound on her lips,&#xD;
and, when she turned toward Hautaine, sur.&#xD;
prise gave way to absolute terror.&#xD;
In all her life, she never forgot the look&#xD;
with which those two men faced each&#xD;
other! Yet there was not in it any thing&#xD;
very desperate or very tragic. They did not&#xD;
look as if they meant to spring at each&#xD;
other's throats, or demand each other's&#xD;
lives, or do any thing else common. to the&#xD;
rivals of melodrama. Indeed, it was easy to&#xD;
see that there was little or no recollection of&#xD;
rivalry between them. They knew each&#xD;
other-that was plain-but it was not as&#xD;
lovers of the same woman, but as men with&#xD;
some strong tie, some strong link of thought&#xD;
or deed in the past. Darcy still stood out-&#xD;
lined in the door, but his very attitude had&#xD;
changed, and seemed to express the same&#xD;
stern immobility that marked his face, while&#xD;
Hautaine had risen, and was clutching ner-&#xD;
vously the back of a chair-his face strange-&#xD;
ly pale, his eyes full of mingled amazement&#xD;
and appeal. It was in this way that they&#xD;
stood gazing at each other in the hushed&#xD;
pause which fell over the room-in this way&#xD;
that they still remained when a minute,&#xD;
which seemed an age to Valerie, had passed&#xD;
away.&#xD;
It was Chancy who first broke the&#xD;
silence by one cry-a cry so full of mingled&#xD;
feeling that it would have been impossible to&#xD;
tell whether yearning passion, or pain, or&#xD;
entreaty, spoke most plainly in it;&#xD;
"Maurice!"&#xD;
That was all. But a hundred words&#xD;
could not have said more. It seemed as if&#xD;
Darcy's face softened for an instant when&#xD;
the sound went out toward him; but, if so,&#xD;
it was only for an instant. It looked as set&#xD;
and stern as before, when he spoke, very&#xD;
coldly:&#xD;
"I regret that accident should have&#xD;
caused this meeting. You know' me well&#xD;
enough to believe that it has not been inten-&#xD;
tional, and that it will be the last.-Miss&#xD;
Aylmer, I beg your pardon for such an in-&#xD;
trusion. I had no idea that you were en-&#xD;
gaged."&#xD;
&#xD;
FACE TO FACE.                            l4~&#xD;
He bowed slightly and distantly to Va- "Why did you stop me, then?" Darcy&#xD;
lerie; then, without further sign, turned to demanded. "To hear this?"&#xD;
go. But Hautaine made one eager step for- "No. To tell you that ke has forgiven&#xD;
ward-uttered one eager, imploring call. me, and to ask-Maurice, to ask if you can&#xD;
"Stop, Maurice!" he cried. "One never-"&#xD;
moment-only one moment!"                 He paused-almost despite him~e1t as it&#xD;
Darcy turned, with a look on his face 'seemed-and Darcy finished the selitence&#xD;
that might have warned the other how little for him without an instant's hesitation:&#xD;
power could he gained by words over any "If I can never forgive you? The an-&#xD;
resolve or decision of his. swer to that is short. Never."&#xD;
"To what. end?" he asked, not angrily, "Yet he-"&#xD;
but in the same cold voice that was infinitely The other interrupted him almost&#xD;
more relentless than anger. fiercely.&#xD;
"You ask me that~" the other cried, "He is not a man, but something mu-&#xD;
passionately. "My God! Do you think I nitely higher. And I, too, might forgive an&#xD;
have not suffered enough to make atone- injury dealt only to myself: but when it is&#xD;
ment for the past? If you could only twofold-nay threefold- Let us talk no&#xD;
know !-if you could only tell__" longer. The very saints of God might feel&#xD;
"Why should I care either to know or that there are some wrongs too deep for&#xD;
to tell?" Darcy interposed, sternly. "What atonement, too bitter for forgiveness, too&#xD;
are your sufferings-granting their existence lasting, even for vengeance!"&#xD;
-to me? Can you give back to him the All the passion within him seemed to&#xD;
aims and objects of life? Can you give back reach its climax in those words, so that&#xD;

give back to yourself the honor you for- from a blow, and Valerie suddenly woke&#xD;
feited? Do even one of these things, and I from a sort of trance, wit*~ dignation and&#xD;
will acknowledge that your sufferings have pity swelling high in r breast. They&#xD;

FACE TO FACE.                          149&#xD;

148                      VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
words, while over Maurice Darcy's face&#xD;
there rolled a cloud heavy and dark as&#xD;
night.&#xD;
He was not likely to reason at such a&#xD;
moment as that-few men perhaps would&#xD;
have been-yet he might have remembered&#xD;
how pitiless he had been in his severity, and&#xD;
fhat a woman's sympathy never fails to&#xD;
range itself on the weaker side. Surely if&#xD;
any thing about the sex may still be termed&#xD;
"divine "-may still be held above the&#xD;
rougher humanity of man, it is this one at-&#xD;
tribute, this unfailing impulse, which makes&#xD;
it ten times sweeter to bind up the wounds&#xD;
of defeat than those of victory, and which,&#xD;
since the beginning of the worid has made&#xD;
them constant and persistent advocates of&#xD;
the losing side. Utterly illogical ones, it&#xD;
may be-but what of that? There are few&#xD;
advocates of any thing who can carry their&#xD;
principles more stanchly into action, and,&#xD;
however defective their 'reasoning may be,&#xD;
their practice, at least, is irreproachable.&#xD;
Acting on impulse,~ like most of her sex,&#xD;
Valerie did not realize, until her words~&#xD;
were past recall, what harm they had&#xD;
worked; then it all rushed over her, in the&#xD;
tone of Darey's reply.&#xD;
"Let me congratulate you on your par-&#xD;
tisan," he said to Hautaine, with icy bitter-&#xD;
ness. "And let me counsel you to follow&#xD;
her advice. My cruelty need not give you&#xD;
a moment's further concern, for we are not&#xD;
likely to meet again."&#xD;
Then he tni.ned nnd quitted the room.&#xD;
4s for the two left behind, they looked&#xD;
at each other in silence, until Hautaine ex-&#xD;
tended his' hands to his champion, who now&#xD;
sat down pale and trembling.&#xD;
"Thank you," he said. "Thank you&#xD;
more than-"&#xD;
But she interi'upted him almost passion-&#xD;
ately. "Nd' don't'thank me. I only said&#xD;
it because he was so bitter and hard, and&#xD;
because-because I am sure you never did&#xD;
any thing unworthy Qf yourself. That was&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"That was enough," he said, "if-if it&#xD;
were only true; But I would be even more&#xD;
pitiful than he thinks me, if I allowed you&#xD;
to believe any thing but that I am wrong,&#xD;
and that he is wholly right."&#xD;
&#xD;
He spoke simply but earnestly, and, lift-&#xD;
ing her head, Valerie looked at him in mute&#xD;
surprise. He could say that!-when the&#xD;
stinging words and contemptuous tones of&#xD;
his stern accuser were still ringing in her&#xD;
ears. He could say that, remembering the&#xD;
unsparing denunciations which had becA&#xD;
heaped upon him, and remembering, too,&#xD;
that he had even been charged with a for-&#xD;
feited honor! When she spoke, after a&#xD;
while, it was wonderingly.&#xD;
"You know best; but it seems to me&#xD;
that scarcely any thing could justify all-all&#xD;
that he said. I am very sorry if you, really&#xD;
have done any thing wrong-and still more&#xD;
sorry if you meant to do it-but my regard&#xD;
would be a worthless thing, indeed, if it&#xD;
failed you just when you have most need of&#xD;
it; or if I could let a single doubt shake&#xD;
the trust and affection of a lifetime. I want&#xD;
you to remember this thing: that there is&#xD;
no wrong which cannot be' expiated; and&#xD;
that you would need go far on any road&#xD;
of error before you could estrange niy-"&#xD;
She stopped short, for a flash of sudden&#xD;
hope had banished all gloom and pain from&#xD;
the eyes fixed on 'her face; and there was&#xD;
in them 'an anxious entreaty that it was bit-&#xD;
terly hard to disappoint. At that moment,&#xD;
she wellnigh wished that she could have&#xD;
added "love "-but at that moment she&#xD;
also felt, more strongly than ever before,&#xD;
that her lips would never, save in false-&#xD;
hood, utter that word to him.&#xD;
"Your--what, Valerie?"&#xD;
He asked this when the pause on her&#xD;
part had been very long, and she bent' her&#xD;
head before him as she answered:&#xD;
"My friendship, Charley."&#xD;
He gave a deep sigh. "If you' knew all,&#xD;
you might think, perhaps, that even your&#xD;
friendship was more than I had a right&#xD;
to expect, but it is very little to have&#xD;
crossed an ocean to receive. Valerie, I am&#xD;
very weak and very guilty-scarcely worthy&#xD;
even to touch your hand-but out of this&#xD;
very desolation, I cry to you: Come to me!&#xD;
Come to me !-love me-strengthen me!&#xD;
and, by the heaven above, us, I swear that&#xD;
you can make me what you will."&#xD;
He stood before her, more impassioned,&#xD;
more vehement than she had ever seen him&#xD;
&#xD;
before. Ab, yes, he did love her-there&#xD;
could be no doubt of that. He had loved&#xD;
her so long, so faithfully, so well, and per-&#xD;
haps it was true that, if she went to him,&#xD;
she could make him what she would. Had&#xD;
Maurice Darcy ever looked or spoken like&#xD;
%iis? Had he ever put himself, his fate, his&#xD;
very life, into her keeping? Yet with what&#xD;
a great rush the woman's heart went out&#xD;
toward him-away, forever away from this&#xD;
eager, passionate paladin, who was ready to&#xD;
do and dare any thing for her sake, ready&#xD;
even to lay all freedom at her feet, and be a&#xD;
serf for evermore!&#xD;
"Hush, Charley, hush!" she said,&#xD;
gravely. "Don't you see how that would&#xD;
be reversing all the right order of things,&#xD;
and how no happiness could ever come to&#xD;
either of us from it? You overrate my&#xD;
strength as much as you underrate your&#xD;
own. At all events, if you could stand&#xD;
with me, you can stand alone, and I am&#xD;
sure you will do so."&#xD;
"Are you?" he said, with a faint, sad&#xD;
smile. "Well, for the sake of others, I&#xD;
trust you may be right. I see you are de-&#xD;
termined, so I will not weary you with any&#xD;
more useless entreaty. I hope I can meet my&#xD;
fate like a man-at least I can bid you good-&#xD;
by. This afternoon I leave for Louisiana."&#xD;
"Oh, Charley, dear Charley," she cried,&#xD;
with all her heart in her throat, "speak to&#xD;
me once like the old time. Tell me once,&#xD;
before you go, that you forgive me. You&#xD;
don't know how I shall suffer in the&#xD;
thought of having pained you-you, my&#xD;
friend, my brother!"&#xD;
It was almost the same appeal that she&#xD;
made to Julian Bomney-as she remem-&#xD;
bered, the moment after she finished speak-&#xD;
ing. Yet nothing could have caused her to&#xD;
realize the immeasurable distance between*&#xD;
these two men, who had both loved her to&#xD;
the utmost. of their capability, as the, an-&#xD;
swer which the young Southerner made-&#xD;
made in chivalric f9rgetfulness o~ self, in&#xD;
generous desire to shield her even from her&#xD;
own reproach:&#xD;
"There is no need to mention such a&#xD;
word between us," '~he said. "You have&#xD;
not the slightest ground for blaming your-&#xD;
self. I was fully aware of the uncertainty&#xD;
&#xD;
of success; and, more than that, I had your&#xD;
own warning. I thought then that the&#xD;
merest chance was worth a trial, and I&#xD;
think so now. I have so little to regret,&#xD;
that I would freely do it all over again.&#xD;
Therefore, you see how misplaced any suf-&#xD;
fering of yours would be. You have not&#xD;
harmed me. No man ever yet was harmed&#xD;
by loving a pure woman, however hopeless&#xD;
that love might be, and it is only a coward&#xD;
who repines over the inevitable. You need&#xD;
not be afraid of that, Valerie; time will&#xD;
heal the wound, even if it can never efface&#xD;
the scar."&#xD;
He spoke cheerfully, even with an at-&#xD;
tempt at lightness, which touched her more&#xD;
than any despondency could have done.&#xD;
Once more the warm tears rushed forth, as&#xD;
she knew that he was bidding her good-by,&#xD;
and she only managed to whisper a few last&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"Charley, don't regret me! If you only&#xD;
knew what I am-indeed, indeed, I am not&#xD;
worth one throb of pain from.such a heart&#xD;
as yours."&#xD;
He only smiled faintly by way of reply.&#xD;
"Whatever my future life may know of love,&#xD;
you will still stand forever apart from all&#xD;
other women in my remembrance," he said.&#xD;
"There !-good-by. God only knows when&#xD;
we shall see each other again."&#xD;
He left her fairly sobbing. Yet, when&#xD;
the hall door closed with that dreary clang&#xD;
which echoes "Good-by" so mournfully,&#xD;
she gathered back something of her usual&#xD;
composure and self-control. It was all over&#xD;
-over and beyond recall completely, so that&#xD;
refining was, as he had said, worse than&#xD;
useless, -and all the tears of all the bright&#xD;
eyes that ever wept could not ease his beart-&#xD;
ache of one pang. There was a good deal&#xD;
of the philosopher, and still more of the&#xD;
fatalist, in Valerie's composition; and, more&#xD;
than any thing else, it was the realization&#xD;
of their uselessness which helped to dry her&#xD;
tears. She had just dashed the last glit-&#xD;
tering drop away, and had risen to go to&#xD;
her own room, when once more the door&#xD;
opened, and once more Darcy stood on&#xD;
the threshold.&#xD;
He made ~no. pause this time, but ad-&#xD;
&#xD;

150                          YALEIIII&#xD;
vanced directly into the room, until he met&#xD;
the woman whom he loved in exactly the&#xD;
same spot where he had faced the man whom&#xD;
he hated.&#xD;
Then they stood looking at each other&#xD;
almost as long and as silently a~ the two&#xD;
who were friends once had done in that&#xD;
other meeting. It was only the old story&#xD;
with both-the story older even than Love&#xD;
-the uplifting of idols; and finding theni pos-&#xD;
sessed of feet of clay. They had not been&#xD;
very deeply steeped in the glamour of pas-&#xD;
sion; each had fancied that he saw more&#xD;
than enough of mortal fault and mortal in-&#xD;
firmity in the other; each had thought, as&#xD;
lovers like to think, of the change and im-&#xD;
provement to be wrought in the nature knit&#xD;
unto his own; and, as their little disagree-&#xD;
ment of the night before had proved, each&#xD;
recognized the fact that there were many&#xD;
angles and outlines of character that might&#xD;
jar roughly together. Vet what of all this?&#xD;
They4had faith, and love, and trust, between&#xD;
them; they might differ or fail to correspond&#xD;
on unimportant points, but they had perfect&#xD;
and entire belief in one another; while now&#xD;
-Ah, it was no wonder they gazed at each&#xD;
other in that sad, bitter silence. The dark-&#xD;
ness of desolation was upon them ; for at&#xD;
their feet lay the shattered fragments of&#xD;
what they had possessed not twelve hours&#xD;
before, and what all the powers of earth&#xD;
could not give back to them now.&#xD;
Darcy was the first to speak, with grave&#xD;
though somewhat formal composure.&#xD;
"I am sure you do methe justice to be-&#xD;
lieve, Miss Aylmer, that my intrusion, a short&#xD;
time ago, was entirely accidental, and with-&#xD;
out any knowledge that I should find you&#xD;
engaged. I am sincerely sorry for the an-&#xD;
noyance I caused you, and I trust my en-&#xD;
trance did not shorten the visit of your--&#xD;
your companion.~~&#xD;
"No," Valerie answered, as coldly as he&#xD;
had spoken, "Th~ Ilautaine was on the point&#xD;
of leaving when you entered."&#xD;
lie glanced involuntarily toward the sofa&#xD;
where he had found them-she weeping, and&#xD;
Charley bending over her-before he spoke&#xD;
again. Then it was in the same tone.&#xD;
"Among the letters which I received&#xD;
this morning was one at which I barely&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
glanced, and on which I failed to bestow&#xD;
even a moment's attention. I did not destroy&#xD;
it, however, because I wanted to find, if&#xD;
possible, some clew to the writer. Here it&#xD;
is. Will you read it?"&#xD;
lb drew several letters from his pocket&#xD;
as he spoke, selected one, and handed it to hei~&#xD;
with an air of distant courtesy which at once&#xD;
recalled the first days of their acquaintance.&#xD;
She took it with a sort of preoccupied ~qui-&#xD;
etude - wondering certainly, but scarcely&#xD;
enough to rouse her to even ordinary inter-&#xD;
est. At this supreme moment of her life--&#xD;
this moment quivering with great issues-&#xD;
what heed or care had she for any thing that&#xD;
could be contained in any letter that was&#xD;
ever written? So, although she took it with-&#xD;
out demur, she opened it carelessly, and still&#xD;
more carelessly ran her eye over the first&#xD;
lines; then there came a start, and a flash of&#xD;
blood to her face: but, although the hand&#xD;
which held the envelope closed over it tight-&#xD;
ly, she read on, without pause or comment,&#xD;
to the end. Yet this was what it proved to&#xD;
be:&#xD;
A letter purporting to emanate, not from&#xD;
the usual anonymous "friend," but from an&#xD;
avowedly anonymous enemy. There was*&#xD;
none of the usual cant concerning a sense of&#xD;
duty in the affair; but, on the contrary, the&#xD;
writer spoke with very candid bitterness.&#xD;
"I don't pretend to take any interest in you,"&#xD;
the unknown said, "t~nd it is not at all for&#xD;
your sake that I take the trouble to give&#xD;
these particulars, but Valerie Aylmer in~&#xD;
flicted a deep wrong on me once-when or&#xD;
how does not matter-and I have waited&#xD;
for many a long day to pay my debt in kind.&#xD;
Nothing will be easier than for you to ascer-&#xD;
tain the truth or falsehood of all I assert,&#xD;
since there is scarcely a man or woman in&#xD;
LoUisiana who is not able to vouch for every&#xD;
thing I say. If you think fit to disregard&#xD;
the warning, I can wish you no worse pun~&#xD;
ishment than that which will speedily over-&#xD;
take you; I can wish you no more bitter&#xD;
memory than that of your wedding-day,&#xD;
even though you receive with your bride the&#xD;
magnificent dower of the heiress of a million-&#xD;
naire.'~ Then followed a record which would&#xD;
have made the cheek of any woman burn&#xD;
with rage and shame. All her old gay&#xD;
&#xD;
FACE T&#xD;
&#xD;
coquetries were brought up against her in&#xD;
blackeniug array. The names and the bare&#xD;
outline of facts were given accurately, but&#xD;
every incident was distorted, every folly mag-&#xD;
nified, every indiscretion heightened, every&#xD;
result darkened, until she who had dealt only&#xD;
in that light, playful warfare which never&#xD;
yet worked serious ill to ~ny head or heart,&#xD;
was painted as a sort of baleful enchantress,&#xD;
somewhat after the model of those who have&#xD;
lately figured in the pages of a certain class&#xD;
of fiction. Poor Valerie! Her sins, if sins&#xD;
they could be called, had lately been falling&#xD;
heavily enough upon her head, but this&#xD;
seemed the last drop in the cup. Still she&#xD;
read on-on through the cunning mixture of&#xD;
falsehood and fact-until she reached the&#xD;
climax of the whole. That climax was her&#xD;
life-long qfl'airo with Ilautaine. There, in&#xD;
pitiless black and white, she read the history&#xD;
that had culminated and ended forever that&#xD;
day. There was not much exaggeration in&#xD;
this, nor much need for it, and, save as regard-&#xD;
ed the statement of an absolute engagement&#xD;
existing between them when she left Louisi-&#xD;
ana, there was scarcely a single assertion&#xD;
that it was possible for her to deny. Of&#xD;
course they bore a different interpretation&#xD;
from that of reality, but then who of us have&#xD;
not, at some time of our lives, felt powerless&#xD;
before this? Can we bring back the dead&#xD;
acts of the past, and shdw what a difference&#xD;
in their seeming the circumstances of the&#xD;
time, or the subtlety of intention made?&#xD;
Can we refute the words of our own lips by&#xD;
putting back into them the vanished spirit&#xD;
which made their living meaning so different&#xD;
from their cold, dead evidence? Ah, never!&#xD;
And it was this chill certainty which gath-&#xD;
ered round Valerie's heart, as she looked up&#xD;
at last, with a single monosyllable:&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"Do you recognize the hand, or any turn&#xD;
of words, that can tell you who the writer&#xD;
is?" Darcy asked, quietly. "I should like&#xD;
to know."&#xD;
She looked down' again for a moment,&#xD;
and then shook her head, as she handed it&#xD;
back. "Ko," she said, wearily; "and--&#xD;
what does it matter? The post-mark is&#xD;
New Orleans; but I cannot think I left any&#xD;
enemy at home who would stab me in the&#xD;
&#xD;
O FACE                             151&#xD;
dark like this. We Louisianians ma~ hate&#xD;
to the death, but we never express our&#xD;
hatred like cowards. I would rather not&#xD;
conjecture any thing about it, for I am sure&#xD;
my conjecture would fail to touch the right&#xD;
mark, and I could never forgive myself if I&#xD;
wronged my worst enemy by such i~ sus-&#xD;
picion. Besides, as I said before, ~what does&#xD;
it matter? I see it hasdone its work.. I see&#xD;
you believe it."&#xD;
"Believe it!" he repeated, and ~ll~ his&#xD;
outward calm suddenly vanished before the&#xD;
generous light that flashed into his, face.&#xD;
"Believe it 1-this vile thing? What do you&#xD;
take me for? See 1--this is how much I be-&#xD;
lieve it."&#xD;
He crushed it in his hand as he spoke,&#xD;
and the next instant it lay shrivelling on&#xD;
the glowing coals that heaped the grate-&#xD;
sent there by one quick gesture. Then he&#xD;
faced round upon her, with a sudden passion&#xD;
of resolve in his eyes.&#xD;
"That is how much I believe iii" he&#xD;
said. "There is the measure of credence I&#xD;
give its calumnies I Have you forgotten so&#xD;
soon what I told you last night? Have you&#xD;
forgotten already that my honor is pledged&#xD;
to receive only one evidence concerning you&#xD;
-the evidence of your ow~i lips? If I&#xD;
showed you this letter, it was only that you&#xD;
might justify yourself-that you might ex-&#xD;
plain what I saw here this morning, which&#xD;
seemed to come in such apparent confirma-&#xD;
tion of all that was written there."&#xD;
The frank chivalry of the man's nature&#xD;
rang in every tone of loyal trust and truth&#xD;
-yet what a dull, heavy echo it was that&#xD;
Valerie's heart gave back! Justify herself!&#xD;
As if justification was possible in the sense&#xD;
he meant it! A cold torpor seemed creep-&#xD;
ing over her, as she answered, almost me-&#xD;
chanically:&#xD;
"Why do you trouble me? It is evident&#xD;
that you have already judged me unheard.&#xD;
Why not condemn me unheard also?"&#xD;
"Am I not waiting to bear you now?"&#xD;
he asked, quickly. "If I had judged you&#xD;
unheard, do you think I should have cared.&#xD;
to enter your presence again, after the scene&#xD;
I witnessed scarcely half an hour 'ago?-&#xD;
after the: words you uttered when you&#xD;
turned against me .to take the part of the4&#xD;

man who has injured me beyond repair?&#xD;
Have you forgotten all this? And does it&#xD;
look like condemnation?"&#xD;
"No, I have not forgotten," she an-&#xD;
swered, with the same listless quietude;&#xD;
"but I have nothing to say. Your very&#xD;
questions prove that you do suspect me;&#xD;
and I did not need your conduct to Charley&#xD;
to prove how hard and stern you can be. I&#xD;
have no intention of implori4 your mercy&#xD;
as he did. Perhaps it will be best that&#xD;
every thing should end, for I do not think&#xD;
we are likely to learn even a moderate de-&#xD;
gree of tolerance for each other. I might&#xD;
bear severity; but I should revolt once f9r&#xD;
all against cruelty-and you who suspect so&#xD;
early, would hardly grow more trusting as&#xD;
time went on. And yet-"&#xD;
Her voice broke down here,. for a sud-&#xD;
den remembrance of what she was doing,&#xD;
of what she was ending, rushed over her.&#xD;
If Darcy had spoken one word of love or&#xD;
trust then, all might have been welL But&#xD;
the coldness of her repulse stung him deep-&#xD;
ly-him who was very far from being a&#xD;
model hero of romance, but only a man un-&#xD;
reasonable and loving, like other men; a&#xD;
man who had striven hard to put his just&#xD;
doubts aside, and ask as a favor the explana-&#xD;
tion which he might have demanded as a&#xD;
right, and who found this requital very&#xD;
bitter. So he took up her sentence, finish-&#xD;
ing it coolly~&#xD;
"And yet happiness seemed very near&#xD;
to us last night. lint you may be right;&#xD;
we may be too unlike ever to agree. It&#xD;
would seem so, at least, since you will not&#xD;
give me one single proof of good faith. It&#xD;
is only afew words I ask; but perhaps you&#xD;
had better consider before you even think&#xD;
of speaking them. lam undoubtedly a stern,&#xD;
even a hard man-though I scarcely think&#xD;
a cruel one-and a man who, ha always&#xD;
received obedience from others, cannot dis-&#xD;
pense with it in my wife. That point is&#xD;
best made clear at once. And, if impulse&#xD;
swayed you yesterday, don't allow compas-&#xD;
sion to influence you to-day; or, in other&#xD;
words, do not think of me. I have lived&#xD;
without love in the past, and* I can live&#xD;
without it in the future. Think only of&#xD;
yourself, and decide only for yourself."&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
Alas! If she had thought only o~ her-&#xD;
sell; she would have held out her hauds to&#xD;
him with one cry of weary relief, and closed&#xD;
her eyes forever to all the doubt around&#xD;
her. It might have been the wisest course&#xD;
to adopt; but she was not the woman to&#xD;
see this. On the contrary, his hard tone&#xD;
hardened her in turn. She contrasted it&#xD;
with the tones that 80 shortly before had&#xD;
echoed in that room. He could not speak&#xD;
thus, she thought, if he had ever felt one&#xD;
throb of real passion. If he had desired&#xD;
to hear the words of which he spoke, he&#xD;
would never have pleaded for them like&#xD;
that. So the moment of opportunity rolled&#xD;
by for both, and, when she spoke, it was&#xD;
half haughtily.&#xD;
"This is very useless indeed. I have&#xD;
not forgotten your judgment of Charley;&#xD;
and, if I humiliated myself as you desire, I&#xD;
would only bring down such another on my&#xD;
own head. Even now you4alk of hearing&#xD;
me; but I should be blind indeed if I did&#xD;
not see that you believe me to have been&#xD;
engaged to him, even when I accepted&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
The tone of the assertion made it a qucs-&#xD;
tioi~, and she paused as if for an answer.&#xD;
After a moment, one came-steady and firm.&#xD;
"Remembering what I witnessed here&#xD;
half an hour ago, I am constrained to say&#xD;
that I hope so."&#xD;
Had she looked at the matter for a mo-&#xD;
ment, from his point of view, she might have&#xD;
acknowledged the justice of this; but, as it&#xD;
was, all tenderness, all regret, all memory&#xD;
of the past, all hope of the future, vanished,&#xD;
leaving only the sense of keen injustice.&#xD;
"You insult me!" she cried, passionate-&#xD;
ly. "You insult me, as I have never been&#xD;
insulted before in all my life! And, after&#xD;
that, do you expect me to justify myself in&#xD;
your eyes? A thousand timesno! Ifyon&#xD;
can believe that I deceived you so shame-&#xD;
fully, believe it! Only do me the justice&#xD;
to believe also that I shall never offer you&#xD;
any proof to the contrary. You may credit&#xD;
all that-that letter said, if you choose! If&#xD;
you think I could act in such a manner,&#xD;
why, it does not matter in the least whether&#xD;
I really did it or not. The capability is the&#xD;
only point of importance. And poor Char-&#xD;
&#xD;
PAYING&#xD;
ley-~my poor friend! To think that your&#xD;
hate should follow him so bitterly that you&#xD;
must use his honest love by means of which&#xD;
to brand me with duplicity! If you only&#xD;
knew what a comparison you are forcing me&#xD;
to institute! If you only knew how utterly&#xD;
he would scorn the part you are playing&#xD;
now !-he who has never broken a pledge,&#xD;
or uttered a vow that was falsehood-he&#xD;
who has never harbored an unworthy sus-&#xD;
picion, or made love the tool of interest.&#xD;
But then-he has never been tempted by&#xD;
the glitter of an inheritance."&#xD;
She scarcely knew how her flood of&#xD;
bitter passion would terminate, until the last&#xD;
words passed her lips. Then she gave a&#xD;
great gasp, for she saw that it was all over;&#xD;
that no repentance, no regret, could undo it&#xD;
now. Any other taunt, any other charge,&#xD;
might have been forgiven-but never this!&#xD;
Even as she looked, the features hardened,&#xD;
and into the deep-gray eyes there flashed a&#xD;
quick gleam; yet he gazed at her almost&#xD;
incredulously for a moment, before he an-&#xD;
swered. Then it was with very proud dig-&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
"You are not yourself at present," he&#xD;
said. "I think you are scarcely conscious&#xD;
of how much your words imply; so I do not&#xD;
consider it necessary to resent them. In&#xD;
your cooler moments, you will see the in-&#xD;
justice of such a charge; but, even if not,' it&#xD;
hardly matters. You were right a little&#xD;
while ago, in saying that this had better&#xD;
end. You do not deny the existence of&#xD;
another engagement when you accepted&#xD;
me; in. confirmation of which I cannot help&#xD;
recalling your reluctance to make a pub- 1&#xD;
lie acknowledgment of that acceptance. I&#xD;
Whether you meant to keep faith with him&#xD;
or with me, I have no means of knowing;&#xD;
but your grief at his departure, your pas-&#xD;
sionate espousal of his cause, leave me no&#xD;
room to doubt that your heart at least was in&#xD;
his keeping, even while you promised your&#xD;
hand tome. Of how little worth a hand so t&#xD;
given would be, it is~not for me to say. ~&#xD;
Then you have seen fit to charge me with ~&#xD;
deliberate falsity. That alone would end c&#xD;
all between us. And now, I have only one t&#xD;
thing to add. If you merely wished to grati- g&#xD;
fy your vanity by another triumph, it is&#xD;
&#xD;
EIIS DEBT.                        153&#xD;
yours. But it would afford you scant grati-&#xD;
fication if you could know the sentiments&#xD;
whi~h have forever taken the place of love&#xD;
toward you. You have done your worst&#xD;
and your last. It will never again be in&#xD;
your power to inilict another pang upon&#xD;
mc."&#xD;
The grave, chill tones ceased-the tones&#xD;
so entirely without one modulation of pas-&#xD;
sion, that they sounded like the inexorable&#xD;
fiat of Fate-and then he walked deliberately&#xD;
to the door. It opened and closed upon&#xD;
him. Silence complete and deep settled&#xD;
over all things; and, as Valerie sat motion-&#xD;
less, she felt as if her life had cometo an end&#xD;
then and there.&#xD;
-4---.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
PAYiNG HiS DEBT.&#xD;
"Wny, Hautaine, my dear fellow, is this&#xD;
really yourself? By Jove! I am delighted&#xD;
to see you!'~&#xD;
It was the most frank and cheery voice&#xD;
in the world that spoke thus, as Hautaine,&#xD;
absorbed in his own moody thoughts, was&#xD;
striding along the lower part of Charles&#xD;
Street. The touch of a hand on his shoul-&#xD;
der accompanied the words, and turning&#xD;
sharply-almost impatiently-he met the&#xD;
cordial eyes and more cordialface of Harry&#xD;
Axle. A misanthrope could hardly have&#xD;
failed to thaw at such a genial sight; and&#xD;
Ilautaine was the farthest the world from&#xD;
L*ing a misanthrope; so he held out his&#xD;
taud with something not very unlike his&#xD;
isual air of good-fellowship.&#xD;
"Arle, isn't it?" he said. "There's a&#xD;
rood deal of change, but still I think I&#xD;
recognizee my~ six-months' companion on a&#xD;
I~exas gunboat."&#xD;
"Ah, yes, we didn't dress this way in&#xD;
hose days," the other said, gayly, "~ but&#xD;
rt~'importe? They were the very best of&#xD;
!ays-the cream of life-and we know each&#xD;
ther when we meet, despite the tailor and&#xD;
he barber. I wish I could tell you how&#xD;
lad I~m to see you again!"&#xD;
"And I you," said Hautaine, sincerely;&#xD;
&#xD;

154                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                          PAYING 1115 DEBT.                   155&#xD;
&#xD;
*   enough, though ten minutes before he would&#xD;
have done any thing reasonable to avoid the&#xD;
encounter. As it had come about, however,&#xD;
he accepted it philosophically, and was not&#xD;
the mau to chill an old comrade's honest&#xD;
warmth by coldness or indifference.&#xD;
"And to think that this is our first&#xD;
meeting since we blew up the old Chicora,&#xD;
and. shook hands on the beach with the in-&#xD;
tention of running for our lives in different&#xD;
directions!" ArIQ continued, as theyloosed&#xD;
the friei~dly grasp of their hands, and&#xD;
walked on together. "What have you been&#xD;
doing with yourself in the interim? Some-&#xD;
body said you had turned free lance, and&#xD;
gone to the Holy Empire of Mexico.~~&#xD;
"Somebody was quite right as far as&#xD;
* turning free lanc4 went," Hautaine an-&#xD;
swered, "but as for the Holy Empire of*&#xD;
Mexico-I must really be excused, if I prefer&#xD;
some service where a long rope or a quick&#xD;
bullet are not the invariable rewards of&#xD;
merit."&#xD;
"But you haven't been in Louisiana ever&#xD;
since you lowered your flag, have you?"&#xD;
"No-I have been in Paris most of the&#xD;
*   time."&#xD;
"Ab, happy fellow! "said Arle, with a&#xD;
very genuine air of envy. "If that's your&#xD;
place of service, I should have no objection&#xD;
to turning free lance myself. And what in&#xD;
the name of wonder brings you from Paris&#xD;
to Baltimore?"&#xD;
He asked the question heedlessly, and&#xD;
the next moment felt as much embarrassed&#xD;
as a man who has made an egregious blun-&#xD;
der, and is conscious of it, can possibly feel.&#xD;
He had been long in Louisiana, and suffi-&#xD;
ciently among Louisiana men, to hear most&#xD;
of the gossip afloat about La belle iea beZlea,&#xD;
and he knew that this gossip had coupled&#xD;
her name ~nore often with Hautaine's than&#xD;
with any other among her many lovers and&#xD;
countless admirers. He remembered her&#xD;
presence in Baltimore, and-~.-well, the rest&#xD;
was So clear that h~ felt very ~nuch ashamed&#xD;
of his stupidity, and hastened on hurriedly,&#xD;
beforehis companion could reply.&#xD;
"I hope you mean to spend some time&#xD;
among tie. We can't; of course, offer any&#xD;
attractions to. a travelled cosmopolitan who&#xD;
is freshfrom Les Italiens slid Y~ry'sbutwe&#xD;
&#xD;
can show you some pretty women-though&#xD;
the prettiest comes from your own state-.&#xD;
and you'll meet plenty of old comrades who&#xD;
wrn be delighted to see you.&#xD;
"I need not say how much I should en-&#xD;
joy both," Hautaine answered as truthfully,&#xD;
perhaps, as the most of us answer when we&#xD;
say such things; "but the fact is, I am&#xD;
Southward bound this afternoon."&#xD;
"Necessarily?"&#xD;
"Necessarily."&#xD;
"Indeed I am heartily sorry to hear it "-&#xD;
and for once the commonplace words had in&#xD;
them the ring of genuine sincerity-" I was&#xD;
just thinking of several people who would&#xD;
he wonderfully charmed to see you, and&#xD;
wonderfully chagrined to miss. that pleasure.&#xD;
You remember Lawton?"&#xD;
"Of the James River fleet? Undoubted-&#xD;
"Well, he was talking of you only the&#xD;
other day. And then there's Conway-Jack&#xD;
Conway-you surely know him? He was&#xD;
7'&#xD;
in the old service.&#xD;
"Know him!" and the abstracted eye&#xD;
suddenly brightened with pleasure. "I&#xD;
should think I did indeed! We went out as&#xD;
midshipmen together on our first cruise.&#xD;
The best fellow !-Is he really here?"&#xD;
"He realty is. And Darford, and Mere-&#xD;
dith, and-and plenty more. So you see it&#xD;
is impossible for you to go, without at least&#xD;
one reunurn to put us in mind of the past.&#xD;
Come! Defer your departure until to-mor-&#xD;
row afternoon, and take supper with me to-&#xD;
night. Every man of them shall be there to&#xD;
bid you welcon~e. Do you say yes?"&#xD;
Ilautaine hesitated. The frank invita-&#xD;
tion was not nearly so much of a tempta-&#xD;
tion as it should have been. But he felt so&#xD;
reckless, indifferent about almost everything,&#xD;
that he was half inclined to say "yes," from&#xD;
pure indolence about saying "no." There.&#xD;
was no earthly reason why he should hot&#xD;
defer his departure twenty-four hours, and&#xD;
he could more easily drown thought in a&#xD;
jovial supper-party, than wal~dng the deck&#xD;
of the Portsmouth boat. And yet he hesi-&#xD;
tated. Itmighthave been his guardian angel&#xD;
that caused him to do so; that whispered im&#xD;
his ear so urgently, "Go;" that wade him so&#xD;
strangely averse to delay; but, if so, the ad-&#xD;
&#xD;
vice was not a whit more regarded than that&#xD;
of guardian angels usually is.&#xD;
"You'll stay?" Arle said, who saw how&#xD;
the scale was turning.&#xD;
And the other answered, with a reckless&#xD;
defiance of instinct:&#xD;
"It is very good of you to urge it, and&#xD;
yes-~-I'll stay."&#xD;
So the weight fell heavily in the scale of&#xD;
fate, and the matter was settled. He stayed.&#xD;
It was by no means a large or very&#xD;
noisily convivial party who assembled that&#xD;
evening to do justice to Arle's hospitality;&#xD;
and their enjoyment was that of men who&#xD;
were accustomed to do things decently and&#xD;
in order. They were all "old Confed~rates,"&#xD;
all men whose laughing glances had looked&#xD;
on danger and death in countless guise,&#xD;
whose bronzed faces had taken sunshine&#xD;
and rain as either came, on the deck or in&#xD;
the camp-with but one exception. This&#xD;
exception, strange to say-and it accounted&#xD;
for something of a cloud on the sunny brow&#xD;
of the young host-was Julian Romney.&#xD;
41t's deucedly unpleasant," he said, in answer&#xD;
to an aside interrogation on the subject, from&#xD;
Thornton; "I know that as well as you do,&#xD;
but-I couldn't help it without next thing&#xD;
to insulting the fellow, lie was with Dar-&#xD;
ford when 1 asked 1~im, and-well, I thought&#xD;
it would not matter much, and I might as&#xD;
well be civil once in a way. I think we've&#xD;
all rather cut him of late, and he feels&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"So it's a philanthropic thing you're in&#xD;
for doing?" Thornton answered, with a&#xD;
shrug. "I wish you joy of your subject;&#xD;
but I'm sadly afraid you've spoiled your&#xD;
party. There's not a man here who even&#xD;
barely likes Romney; and he's so devilish&#xD;
bad-tempered of late that there's no count-.&#xD;
ing on consequences. However, I'll do my&#xD;
best to keep the peace-perhaps we have&#xD;
been a little harden him-but don't pu1~ me&#xD;
opposite him. That face of his would be&#xD;
intolerable to me."~&#xD;
But perhaps the most thoroughly sur-&#xD;
prised and least pleased of the party was&#xD;
Hautaine himself, when the stranger was&#xD;
presented to him, and he remembered his&#xD;
close connection with the Yacquant family.&#xD;
&#xD;
A hot, sharp pang of jealousy shot through.&#xD;
and through him, as he looked at the hand-&#xD;
some face-handsome yet, although evil lines&#xD;
had been ploughed around the beautiful&#xD;
mouth, and on the smooth white brow-and&#xD;
thought in his heart that this young Adonis&#xD;
must necessarily be the rival who had stolen.&#xD;
from him the prize of his life. And it chanced&#xD;
that, as he thought this, with wistful, honest&#xD;
envy, Arle said, suddenly:&#xD;
"By-the-by, I am very sorry that Darcy&#xD;
could not join us. I don't suppose you ever&#xD;
met him, Hautaine; but he served in Yir-&#xD;
ginia during the whole war, and is the most&#xD;
capital fellow you can imagine. It's rather&#xD;
curious, too, that we were speaking of&#xD;
Mexico, this morning,; and he tells me he's&#xD;
going there."&#xD;
This unexpected statement created so&#xD;
much of a sensation, that no one noticed&#xD;
Hautaine's silence or his change of color.&#xD;
"What, Darcy going to Mexico!"&#xD;
"The deuce! You Tnust be mistaken."&#xD;
"It's rather late in the day for that!"&#xD;
"I can't believe it possible!"&#xD;
"When did he say so? Are you sure&#xD;
about it, Hal?"&#xD;
"lam perfectly sure that he told me so,"&#xD;
Arle answei~ed; "and I don't think he's a&#xD;
man to say one thing and mean another-or&#xD;
to say a thing, even if he means it, and then&#xD;
change his mind. I~went to his studio and&#xD;
found him busy packing up so I naturally&#xD;
inquired if he was going to change the apart-&#xD;
ment. He said yes-for good. Naturally,&#xD;
again I asked, 'How so?' and then he said&#xD;
that he leaves for New York to-night, and'&#xD;
sails to-morrow for Havre."&#xD;
"And do you call that Mexico?" put in&#xD;
an incredulous listener.&#xD;
"No-I don't. And neither did he. Of&#xD;
course, I sald-sincerely enough too-bow&#xD;
sorry we shall be to lose him; and then I&#xD;
asked him if he meant to set up an ateli~r in&#xD;
Paris. The answer was, that ha was tired&#xD;
of paii~.ting, and, in less than a month, he ex-&#xD;
pected to be in Mexico."&#xD;
"But what for?" demanded two or three,&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
At which the Signor Arie shrugged his&#xD;
shoulders.&#xD;
"Who can say, mes amie? Do you al-&#xD;

158                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                            PAYING HIS DEBT.                      15,T&#xD;
&#xD;
ways kilow what you intend to do, and why&#xD;
you mean to do it? Darcy simply told me&#xD;
what I tell you, that he is tired of painting&#xD;
-I have heard him say that before-that&#xD;
he liked action, that. he wasn't tired of&#xD;
fightiiig, and that he meant to go to Mexico&#xD;
and get enough of it-~voila tout!"&#xD;
"I'erhaps he thinks Maximilian will&#xD;
make him a duke or a marshal," said Dar-&#xD;
ford, lazily.&#xD;
"Perhaps you will pass the decanter at&#xD;
your elbow," Thornton said, "and we'll&#xD;
drink to his success and happiness, wher-&#xD;
ever he 'goes. He is one of the few men,&#xD;
whom I ever met, that I am sorry to see&#xD;
drop out of my life. It's rather early in&#xD;
the evening for toasts, but still, as long as&#xD;
he's on the tapis, let us pledge him in the&#xD;
wine he is not here to enjoy."&#xD;
So they pledged him deeply, and, as&#xD;
Romney set down his glass, he looked at&#xD;
Hautaine with a glance which the latter&#xD;
met and understood as little as possible.&#xD;
How could he, indeed, be supposed to know&#xD;
that this man, whom he esteemed his fa-&#xD;
vored rival, was just then thinking with&#xD;
bitter rage that he-Hautaine-had by his&#xD;
success sent the lover of yesterday out of&#xD;
their common path. "Curse him! He&#xD;
musthave won the day after all!" Romney&#xD;
thought;. and then he set his teeth together&#xD;
with a sudden, savage resolve which did not&#xD;
accord very well with the gay tonesand peals&#xD;
of laughter, the lights and wi.ue, and gener-&#xD;
ally festive ainof all things around them.&#xD;
For the next bour or two1 however, ev-&#xD;
ery thing went on. as smoothly and pleas-&#xD;
antly as a host's 'heart. could desire. They&#xD;
all kneW each other so well, they had gone&#xD;
through so much of adventure together, and&#xD;
lovedand drank and fought in intimate com-&#xD;
radeship so long, that there was nothing&#xD;
whatever to chill or repress the genial&#xD;
warmth that pervaded every thing said or&#xD;
done, even to the very stories and jests6&#xD;
Roinney conducted himself in quite an irre-&#xD;
proachable manner: he said little, for remi-&#xD;
niscences of field and flood were not exactly&#xD;
in his way, but that little was in very good&#xD;
taste, and only one or two of those who sat&#xD;
nearest him noticed that he drank more&#xD;
constantly and deeply than any one else at&#xD;
&#xD;
the table. He was so accustomed to this,&#xD;
however, that it had no perceptible effect&#xD;
on his head, when, by some chance, the&#xD;
conversation veered round to-Darcy again.&#xD;
"I shall never forget ])arcy's gallantry&#xD;
that day," one of the party said-he had&#xD;
been telling~ a campaigning anecdote of&#xD;
some description or other-'~ he was serv-&#xD;
ing on R-'s staff then, and there was&#xD;
no earthly reason for his going into the fight&#xD;
with us; but he did-as a volunteer, you&#xD;
know.-and distinguished himself wonder-&#xD;
fully. Maximilian may be glad to see such&#xD;
nerve and pluck coming into his empire, I&#xD;
can tell you. But, then, I can't help think-&#xD;
ing that the move is a confoundedly queer&#xD;
one-ifl~ him."&#xD;
"Certainly the land of the Montezumas&#xD;
is about the last place in the world that 1&#xD;
should care about finding myself in just&#xD;
now," said Conway. "I remember the last&#xD;
time I was at Vera Cruz-"&#xD;
"Yellow fever, or a revolution, was&#xD;
there also, no doubt," said Thornton, in-&#xD;
terrupting him. "We'll take either fact&#xD;
for granted; but I decidedly *object to&#xD;
your spinning another long-winded yarn.&#xD;
You've only told half a dozen already this&#xD;
evening. But you're right about Darcy.&#xD;
It's so very queer, this move of his-that&#xD;
for once, 1 have some curiosity to know a&#xD;
little of motive and meaning. Can't any-&#xD;
body throw any light on the subject?"&#xD;
"If it wasn't Darcy," said Arle, with a&#xD;
laugh, "I should think that I detected the&#xD;
mark of feminine claws in the business;&#xD;
but he is quite above such a suspicion."&#xD;
"No man is above it," said Darford, sen-&#xD;
tentiously. "We are all fools, sooner or&#xD;
later; and why n~ot Darcy, like the rest of&#xD;
us? He has been very attentive to Miss&#xD;
Rivi~re lately-mayn't she have proved&#xD;
hard-hearted?"&#xD;
"You might as well talk of a canary's&#xD;
proving hard-hearted," Thornton an~were4,&#xD;
impatiently. "She's ,a perfect child, in the&#xD;
first place, and one of the~ women who&#xD;
couldn't say~ no to anybody, if her life de-&#xD;
pended on it, in the second."&#xD;
"She said it to one late lamented friend,&#xD;
Godon Bird, without much hesitation," Dar-&#xD;
ford rejoined. "I have that much of&#xD;
&#xD;
knowledge, for I was penned in a corner,&#xD;
and heard the whole declaration. She did&#xD;
it very neatly too, I can tell you; and fin-&#xD;
ished up poor Bird so completely, that he&#xD;
donned his feathers, and took flight for&#xD;
some other region next day."&#xD;
"And you call that a case in point?"&#xD;
asked Ark. "Any woman in her sane&#xD;
senses would have said no to that fool; but&#xD;
as for Darcy-the thing's absurd. Besides,&#xD;
I don't believe he ever thought of falling in&#xD;
love with her. She's pretty enough; but&#xD;
she's more in your style than his."&#xD;
"I'll leave the matter to Romney. He's&#xD;
been living in the house with both of them,&#xD;
so he ought to know," Darford answered.&#xD;
"Julian, old fellow, can you tell us who's&#xD;
right?"&#xD;
Julien looked up quickly, with a sudden&#xD;
light in his eyes which the other did not&#xD;
understand-a light of exultation at seeing&#xD;
his chance so soon and so clear.&#xD;
"Neither of you is' right," he an-&#xD;
swered. "Miss Rivi~re has no more to do&#xD;
with Darcy's movements than I have; but&#xD;
-I wonder you never thought that he had&#xD;
been very closely under the guns of a more&#xD;
dangerous woman than she will ever be, if&#xD;
she lives a hundred years."&#xD;
*   "By Jove!" cried more than one voice.&#xD;
"You don't mean that La belle des belles has&#xD;
crippled him too?"&#xD;
Julian turned round to Hautaine, with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"I mean," he said, "that Mr. Hautaine&#xD;
can sat~fy your curiosity on that score bet-&#xD;
ter than I, and that he can also tell you&#xD;
exactly why Captain Darcy's resolution to&#xD;
go to Mexico has only been formed since his&#xD;
own arrival in Baltimore."&#xD;
The 'wor ls fell clearly and distinctly on&#xD;
every ear at~ the table, and every eye turu~ed&#xD;
at once' to Hautaine's face-the face that&#xD;
had 'suddenly grown pale and full of star-&#xD;
tled surprise. The attack was as unexpect-&#xD;
ed as any thing couhl, possibly have been;&#xD;
but it did not deprive him entirely of self-&#xD;
possession; on the contrary, he answered,&#xD;
readily and coolly:&#xD;
"I don't understand you, Mr. Romney.&#xD;
Perhaps you will be kind enough to explain&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
&#xD;
"The matter is scarcely worth an expla-&#xD;
tion," Julian answered, carelessly. "We all&#xD;
know the old proverb about ignorance be-&#xD;
ing bliss, and we also know-most, of us-&#xD;
Miss Aylmer's fttvorite modes of disposing&#xD;
of her troublesome admirers."&#xD;
"It is a matter of profound indifference&#xD;
to me what you may or may not know,"&#xD;
Hautaine answered coldly, "except in thus&#xD;
far-that neither you nor any other man&#xD;
has ever known, or can ever know, any thing&#xD;
of MisS Aylmer whinh is not to her hoAor&#xD;
and credit."&#xD;
Julian laughed-a sneering laugh which&#xD;
made the blood stir angrily in the veins of&#xD;
more than one of his listeners-and then&#xD;
answered in the same clear, musical voice:&#xD;
"It is a very fine thing to be chivalric,&#xD;
Mr. Hautaine, especially about the woman&#xD;
whom you wish, or expect, or intend, to&#xD;
marry. But it's rather late in the day to&#xD;
take that tone about the most notorious flirt&#xD;
in America. I don't pretend to know how&#xD;
the matter was settled between Darcy and&#xD;
yourself or how Miss Ayhner made good&#xD;
her story to either of you; but I do know&#xD;
ihat she was engaged yesterday to the&#xD;
man who, whether filter orjilted, isgoing to&#xD;
Mexico to-day."&#xD;
Hautaine gave one uncontrollable start.&#xD;
It was impossible that he could have avoided&#xD;
it, since the thought of any thing between&#xD;
Valerie and Dercy flashed on him for the&#xD;
first time with overwhelming surprise. His&#xD;
mind went back like lightning to the scene&#xD;
of that day-the scene when she had come&#xD;
between them end taken his part-and he&#xD;
gave a gasp, half of astonishment, half of&#xD;
incredulity. He was so taken by storm, as&#xD;
it were, that for a mome~it he could not an-&#xD;
swer Romney. Then, it was more the con-&#xD;
ventional instinct than any thing else that&#xD;
made him say:&#xD;
"And whether this be true or not-you&#xD;
must excuse me if I say that ~the presump-&#xD;
tive evidence is all against it-will you al-&#xD;
l~w me to inquire in what manner it con-&#xD;
cerns you?"&#xD;
Julian looked at him for a moment before&#xD;
he answered, slowly:&#xD;
"It concerns me exactly as ut concerns&#xD;
any one else-yourself for instance~-~wbo&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
has contributed to the amusement antI en-&#xD;
joyed the favors of La belle de8 belles."&#xD;
The tone of this sentence made its insult&#xD;
to the woman whose name he spoke so ap-&#xD;
parent, that it was the yoi~ng~ host who said&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"Romney, you forget yourself. This is&#xD;
no mode in which to ~l.is~uss a lady. Let us&#xD;
~chan~&amp;amp; the subject."&#xD;
"No," Hautaine interrupted, before any&#xD;
one 'else could ~jeak. "Don't change the&#xD;
subject before I have said one word to Mr.&#xD;
Ilomney. He has thought fit to put me in&#xD;
the same category with himself, as having&#xD;
couttibuted to the amusement and enjoyed&#xD;
the favors of' Miss Aylmer. What my con-&#xD;
nection with her has been, doas not concern&#xD;
him in the least; but his conduct to-night&#xD;
has proved that, if he ever contributed to her&#xD;
amusement, it was too much honor for a man&#xD;
who cannot speak of her as befits a gentle-&#xD;
man; and that the only favors he could ever&#xD;
have enjoyed must have been in common&#xD;
with the servants who place chairs and open&#xD;
doors for her."&#xD;
"Do you mean-" Julian began, hotly,&#xD;
when Thornton's hand fell on his shoulder.&#xD;
"That is quite enough, Mr. Romney,"&#xD;
he said, sternly. "This is not a drinking-&#xD;
saloon, where you can quarrel and fight as&#xD;
you please; and 'we are not blacklegs, but&#xD;
gentlemen. You have strangely forgot-&#xD;
ten several things to-night; among others,&#xD;
courtesy to your host, when you attack one&#xD;
of his guests in this unprovoked manner."&#xD;
It is doubtful if Julian even heard the&#xD;
words, forcibly uttered as they were, for he&#xD;
only sl1ook off the restraining hand, and fin-&#xD;
ished his sentence~to the young Louisianian,&#xD;
who looked at him with eyes full of con-&#xD;
temptuous disdain across the table:&#xD;
"t~o you mean to insult me, Mr. Hau-&#xD;
tame?"&#xD;
"I had no such intention," Hautaine an-&#xD;
swered, coolly; "but you can construe my&#xD;
words as you please."&#xD;
"You will answer for them, then?"&#xD;
"No," he replied, scornfully. "I should&#xD;
not dream of beingguilty of such a disrespect&#xD;
to Miss A~4mer as to allow her name to be&#xD;
drawn any further into a discussion where&#xD;
it has no right to be at all. I have told you&#xD;
&#xD;
'what I think of yourself and your state-&#xD;
ments, and that is all I shall do.--Arle, you&#xD;
~were right a little while ago - shall we&#xD;
change the subject now?"&#xD;
But it was hardly worth while to do so,&#xD;
for all their pleasant spirit and ease seemed&#xD;
suddenly to have forsaken the party. Of&#xD;
course they made an effort to be gay and&#xD;
genial once more; but it was so palpably&#xD;
an effort, that the failure 'which ensued was&#xD;
only what might have been expected. If&#xD;
Romney would have done the only proper&#xD;
thing, i. e., gone away, perhaps they might&#xD;
have got over it after awhile; but how was&#xD;
it possible to be any thing hut awkward and&#xD;
uncomfortable with that overcast presence&#xD;
in their midst? So they drank their wine&#xD;
absently, and talked heavily on business,&#xD;
and politics, and the like topics, but nobody&#xD;
even attempted to go back to the themes&#xD;
of adventure and daring which had stirred&#xD;
them into such warm life a short time&#xD;
before. They were all gentlemen, and so,&#xD;
accustomed to submit unhesitatingly to the&#xD;
conventionalities of social life; but the&#xD;
ruder instincts of the man made. more than&#xD;
one of them look at Romney, and think how&#xD;
pleasant it would be to rid themselves of&#xD;
him by a very summary process of eject-&#xD;
ment. Before long, Arle made the move-&#xD;
ment to leave table, and then, while 'the&#xD;
rest were scattered about the room smoking,&#xD;
he drew Julian aside.&#xD;
"lam the last man in the world to wish&#xD;
to revive anything unpleasant," he said, "but&#xD;
I am sure that, if you think a moment, Rom-&#xD;
ney, you will see that you owe Hautaine an&#xD;
apology. He is not only entitled to special&#xD;
courtesy as a stranger among us, but he has&#xD;
been a life-long friend of the Aylmer family.&#xD;
Of course I take it for granted that you did&#xD;
not know this, or you could not have spo-&#xD;
ken as you did. It only makes it the more&#xD;
imperative, though, that you should apolo-&#xD;
gize.&#xD;
"And suppose I decline to do so?" Ju-&#xD;
han asked, sullenly.&#xD;
The other looked at him with surprise,&#xD;
that had not a little of contempt in it.&#xD;
~ "I am totally unable to suppose such a&#xD;
t ing," he answered, gravely. "You do not&#xD;
forget, I am sure, the obligation of courtesy&#xD;
&#xD;
which rests upon us as Baltimoreans and as&#xD;
gentlemen. You cannot even forget what&#xD;
you owe to me-since you insulted my&#xD;
guest at my table. But if you should for-&#xD;
get these things-"&#xD;
"Well," said Juhian, in a tone of defi-&#xD;
ance, as he paused, "if I should forget them&#xD;
-what then?"&#xD;
"Why, then," said die young Maryland-&#xD;
er, haughtily, "the matter becomes person-&#xD;
al between us two; and, as no man living&#xD;
owes a deeper debt of gratitude to Miss Ayl-&#xD;
mer than I do, I shall take upon myself the&#xD;
duty of demanding full retraction and apol-&#xD;
ogy for the sneer cast on her a little while&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"This is all nonsense, Mr. Arle, and you&#xD;
ought to know it as well as I do," said Ju-&#xD;
han, bruskly. "I am not a man to be&#xD;
browbeaten; and I haven't the slightest in-&#xD;
tention of retracting or apologizing for any&#xD;
thing I may have said or insinuated about&#xD;
Valerie Aylmer. If you are anxious for a&#xD;
quarrel, I am not likely to balk your humor.&#xD;
If notI shall have the honor of wishing&#xD;
you good-evening."&#xD;
The calm insolence of his tone provoked&#xD;
Arle, as it might have provoked even a&#xD;
milder man. He looked at him with quick,&#xD;
contemptuous scorn, when he answered in a&#xD;
tone that did full justice to the words:&#xD;
"You can go, if you like, of course; but&#xD;
I hope you will be kind enough to strike my&#xD;
name from your list of acquaintances after&#xD;
to-night. I gave you credit before this for&#xD;
slandering like a woman; but I didn't give&#xD;
you credit for refusing to accept the conse-&#xD;
quences like a man."&#xD;
"That is quite enough," Julian said, in a&#xD;
tone of suppressed passion.' "I see it is the&#xD;
quarrel you want, and you might have had it&#xD;
without this last insult. I take it for granted&#xD;
that you're not so pacific as your friend, and&#xD;
that you mean to answer for your words."&#xD;
"I am at your service," the other an-&#xD;
swered, coldly. Then, with a formal bow on&#xD;
each side, they part&amp;amp;1.&#xD;
An hour or two later, all the prelimi-&#xD;
naries of the meeting were arranged, and&#xD;
this was how Harry Arle paid his debt to&#xD;
Valerie Aylmer.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
TOUT EST PEBDU.&#xD;
&#xD;
AFTER Darcy left her, no one saw any&#xD;
thing more of Miss Aylmer. She went to&#xD;
her own room, and, locking the door, refused&#xD;
admittance to every one, even to Alix.&#xD;
There was a dinner-party arranged for that&#xD;
evening, which caused Madame Vacquant&#xD;
to send up several appeals for her presence;&#xD;
but the same inflexible refusal was returnedd&#xD;
to all. For once in her life, lee COflA)C7Z~flCC8&#xD;
had lost all power over Valerie; and sh~&#xD;
~who only a short time before thought ~he&#xD;
would have died ore a single pang of hers&#xD;
should have .been~exhibited to curious or&#xD;
malignant eyes-she, like many another,&#xD;
when the test came, found that theQry&#xD;
and practice are essentially different th5i~igs.&#xD;
The same impulse took her to her chitrk ber,&#xD;
and closed her door upon the outer'woz'ld,&#xD;
that takes a wounded wild animal io its lair&#xD;
to suffer-it may be even to die-alone.&#xD;
How much she suffered, she could not&#xD;
have told herself; for the blow had been so&#xD;
sudden and sharp that it partially deadened&#xD;
sensation; and the time remained in her&#xD;
after-memory almost a blank. She could&#xD;
only recall the utter and forlorn abandon-&#xD;
ment of misery that seemed to weigh upon&#xD;
her, as sh~ tested the first bitterness of her&#xD;
desolation. She could only recall a dim pic-&#xD;
ture of herself; as she sat by the window,&#xD;
watching, in a sort of passive stupor, the&#xD;
falling snow, and listening to the church&#xD;
clocks as they told the passage of time that&#xD;
had lost all significance for her. The sounds&#xD;
of the house and of the street came as to&#xD;
muffled ears. The hours passed, but left&#xD;
not a token of their flight behind them; and&#xD;
when the day wore on, and at last the&#xD;
shades of night began to close over the&#xD;
scene on which she gazed, she could scarcely&#xD;
have told whether the 6onsciousness of this&#xD;
was most relief or pain. That day, which&#xD;
should be marked in black as the most mis-&#xD;
erable of her life, was past. But then,&#xD;
what an interminable vista of other days&#xD;
stretched before her! To-morrow, and to-&#xD;
morrow, and to-morrow! They were all to&#xD;
bear, all to suffer, all to live through-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8073-00000081"/>&#xD;
160                        VAL1~RIE AYLMJIB.                                                            TOUT EST PERDU.                         161&#xD;
&#xD;
alone 1 This prospect, which is bitter some-&#xD;
times even to the naturally patient and well&#xD;
disciplined, was something far more than&#xD;
bitter to this uticurbed, rebellious nature.&#xD;
She told herself with fierce emphasis, that&#xD;
it was unendurable, that sh~ would never&#xD;
bear it; and then she broke down in a burst&#xD;
of burning tears, because she felt in her in-&#xD;
most heart that the barrier against which&#xD;
she dashed herself was granite; and that,&#xD;
come what woulc~ of grief or pain; she must&#xD;
endure, she must bear it. She had sown the&#xD;
seed: she must reap the harvest. There&#xD;
was nothing for It but resignation; and yet&#xD;
the mere thought of such a thing came to&#xD;
her as a mockery. Resignation I That&#xD;
might answer for the pale, heavy-eyed chil-&#xD;
dren of suffering and toil; for those on&#xD;
whom was branded deep the signet of fiery&#xD;
trials, for whom life was nothing save one&#xD;
long martyrdom; but for her-her in the&#xD;
royal zenith of her youth and power-her to&#xD;
whom enjoyment and pleasure, and the&#xD;
sweets of love, and the gifts of life, were all&#xD;
of right divine-how should she ever learn&#xD;
the grand lesson of those grand words which&#xD;
shehad spoken, with only a dim, half-heedful&#xD;
sense of their meaning, so short a time be-&#xD;
fore-" He who best knows how to endure,&#xD;
shall possess the greater peace I"&#xD;
At dark, Fanch ette brought up the coffee,&#xD;
which she considered the only proper thing&#xD;
for such a headache as Miss Aylmer was&#xD;
supposed to be suffering with. Then the&#xD;
blinds were closed, the fire replenished, and&#xD;
she was left again to silence. Then again&#xD;
the same lethargy crept over her, and she&#xD;
lay in a large chair, watching the glowing&#xD;
bed of coals as blankly as she had watched&#xD;
the feathery wreaths of snow, listening&#xD;
vaguely to the strains of music and echo of&#xD;
gay voices that floated up faintly from the&#xD;
drawing-room whenever the doors were&#xD;
opened, and wholly unconscious how late it&#xD;
was growing, until Fanchette came up at&#xD;
midnight sincerely surprised that she had&#xD;
not been summoned to her usual night&#xD;
duties of the toilet. Perhaps le. conve-&#xD;
nancee began to resume something of their&#xD;
sway, for her mistress murmured a half ex-&#xD;
cuse for the omission, and then prepared to&#xD;
go to bed. Once there, strange to say,~she&#xD;
&#xD;
slept deeply-slept the spent sleep of ex-.&#xD;
haustion. But this period of rest was not&#xD;
very long. The first gray gleam of morning&#xD;
waked her, as it streamed through a half-&#xD;
opened blind, ovei her bed. The first im-&#xD;
pulse was to turn her face away, and strive&#xD;
to win a little longer unconsciousness-but&#xD;
that was vain. The tyrant Thought had re-&#xD;
sumed his mastery, and sleep was impossi-&#xD;
ble. So sharp were the recollections which&#xD;
rushed over her, that almost unconsciously&#xD;
she sprang from her pillows as if they had&#xD;
been filled with thorns. Endurance-pas-&#xD;
sive endurance, at least--had reached its&#xD;
farthest limit. Come what would, she felt&#xD;
goaded to the last verge, she felt that she&#xD;
must for a time escape from herself. She&#xD;
looked round the walls of her room that&#xD;
yesterday had seemed to her a shrine of ref-&#xD;
uge; now it took the aspect of a prison.&#xD;
And then it was that there came another&#xD;
impulse-the impulse to carry her misery to&#xD;
the sanctuary, and lay it down before the&#xD;
altar where never yet a human soul has gone&#xD;
for comfort and failed to find it.&#xD;
She rose at once, and dressed herself&#xD;
quickly, scarcely observing the cold atmos-&#xD;
phere of her room, where the last night's&#xD;
fire had died away to blackness. Then she&#xD;
went down-stairs, and along the dark pas-&#xD;
sages, unfastened the heavy bolts with a&#xD;
good deal of difficulty, and let herself out of&#xD;
the front-door. The snow and sleet of the&#xD;
night before had changed to a fine rain,&#xD;
which the wind drove straight in her face as&#xD;
she hook her way down Charles Street; ~but&#xD;
she scarcely felt, and certainly paid no heed&#xD;
to it. The hour was so early that as yet&#xD;
there was scarcely any thing astir, or any-&#xD;
body to be seen, save a few milk-wagons, in&#xD;
the first place, and one or two drowsy police-&#xD;
men in the second. But when she opened&#xD;
the cathedral door a pleasant sense of&#xD;
warmth stole over her, and there were many&#xD;
kneeling forms scattered over the demi-ob-&#xD;
scure of the lt~rge church, the spacious aisles&#xD;
and lofty dome of which looked solemnly.&#xD;
vast as a few gas-lights which illuminated&#xD;
the seats nearest the altar strove vainly to&#xD;
pierce the general gloom. The priest was in&#xD;
the act of consecration when she entered,&#xD;
and a profound stillness reigned over all&#xD;
&#xD;
things-only broken now and then by the&#xD;
silver tinkle of the acolyte's bell giving warn~&#xD;
ing of the elevation. The door clanged be-&#xD;
hind her, and her steps fell with an almost&#xD;
painful distinctness on the paved aisle; but&#xD;
there was no stir among the kneeling forms&#xD;
between whom she passed, not a head was&#xD;
lifted, not an eye turned from the altar, nor&#xD;
did a single lip cease its fervently-uttered&#xD;
prayer. This in itself was a relief-this in&#xD;
itself proved that she had come to one place&#xD;
in the world where curiosity does not find&#xD;
admittance, where the wretched and the&#xD;
weary may go, sure that no inquisitive&#xD;
glances will seek them out, and force upon&#xD;
them the scrutiny which they feel to be al-&#xD;
most more than they can bear. She sank&#xD;
down in one of the farther pews that had&#xD;
been left to darkness, and then, for a brief&#xD;
time, the sore heart found rest. She knew&#xD;
that the pang would return-all the sharper&#xD;
and sterner, perhaps-but for a time it was&#xD;
stilled. For a time, she could lay down the&#xD;
burden of error and grief, for a time sink in&#xD;
humiliation before the altar, and, with her&#xD;
eyes on the thorn-crowned head above her,&#xD;
say, "Lord, I am weak and frail-be Thou&#xD;
my strength." And it seemed to her alone&#xD;
-to her in her bitterness and rebellion-&#xD;
that the priest spoke when, turning round,&#xD;
he uttered the solemn "Sursum corda."&#xD;
Sursum corda! Ay, lift them up !-up&#xD;
from the clouds and mist of this troubled&#xD;
world !-up from the trials that meet, and&#xD;
the temptations that beset !-up from the&#xD;
~weary struggle !-up from the failing flesh!&#xD;
-up from the constant sin !-up from the&#xD;
wrong, the strife, the suffering I-up to the&#xD;
glorious vision of a realm where neither sin&#xD;
nor pain shall have any more dominion over&#xD;
us!&#xD;
Two masses had been said before Vale-&#xD;
rie thought of leaving the church, and then&#xD;
it was only when a sick faintness-the result&#xD;
of physical exhaustion-r~shed over her, that&#xD;
she felt the necessity of doing so. Yet it&#xD;
was very hard to quit that serene sanctuary,&#xD;
to leave that one haven of rest and refuge,&#xD;
and go back to the fierce turmoil and dreary&#xD;
hopelessness of existence. She rose from&#xD;
her knees lingeringly, and yet more linger-&#xD;
ingly looked around her. ihe slight stir of&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
priests and acolytes at the high altar scarcely&#xD;
disturbed the pervading calm which brooded&#xD;
over the whole interior; and her heart-her&#xD;
poor, aching, yearning heart-seemed hushed&#xD;
and stilled by the ineffable peace. But long&#xD;
and painful entotion had done its work, and&#xD;
she felt that she must go, for even now a&#xD;
strange giddiness seized her, and a strange&#xD;
mist rose over all the objects at which she&#xD;
gazed. She walked slowly down the aisle,&#xD;
but at the door paused again. There was&#xD;
only one more step, and. the noise of the&#xD;
world would rush over her, the excitement&#xD;
of the world would claim her; so, crossing&#xD;
herself with holy water, she looked wistfully&#xD;
back toward the distant altar, the calm&#xD;
statues, the sanctuary lamp gleaming like a&#xD;
faint, pale star, and felt-was it an instinct?&#xD;
-as if she could not bear to go. But a little&#xD;
child, who was entering, held open the door&#xD;
for the beautiful lady who stood there so&#xD;
strangely motionless; two women stared at&#xD;
her as they came down the aisle together;&#xD;
and, waking to a knowledge of these things&#xD;
with a start, she drew down her veil and&#xD;
went away.&#xD;
She walked slowly homeward through&#xD;
the misty rain-how well she remembered&#xD;
afterward the aspect which every thing bore&#xD;
that morning !-thinking to herself that this&#xD;
was a type of what her life was to b~ here-&#xD;
after. This dull-gray sameness was to be&#xD;
hers, instead of the sunshine of love and&#xD;
hope that had made existence ~o fair and&#xD;
beautiful only yesterday. Yesterday! Was&#xD;
it only yesterday? It seemed as if it must.&#xD;
have been so long ago, as if the gulf which&#xD;
divided her from happiness was years, in-&#xD;
stead ofmerelyhours. Dimly these thoughts&#xD;
came to her, and her 'heart was throbbing&#xD;
once more with its sharp, sick pain, when&#xD;
she came in sight of her grandfather's door.&#xD;
She started. Perhaps her nerves were~&#xD;
overwrought, but a sudden wild instinct of&#xD;
fear seized her as she saw several carriages&#xD;
standing there, and the first on which her&#xD;
eye rested was that of Dr. Preston. Mau-&#xD;
rice! Had any thing happened to 1~im 7&#xD;
that was her only thought, as she hurried&#xD;
forward-and came face to face with him in*&#xD;
the door-way.&#xD;
He was standing there with a knot of&#xD;

two or three gentlemen, all speaking low,&#xD;
all looking as men only look when they have&#xD;
been brought in contactt with some great&#xD;
tragedy, and all of whom fell back in sudden,&#xD;
hushed silence when they saw who was ap-&#xD;
proaching. Darcy alone remained perfectly&#xD;
~.till, and so it was that they met again-he&#xD;
pale and grave with the gravity of some&#xD;
awful certainty; she quivering and trem-&#xD;
bling all over with surprise *~nd apprehen-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"Maurice," she said, quickly, "what-&#xD;
what is thematter?"&#xD;
He made a step forward-a pitiful light&#xD;
in his eyes, that was quite apart from ten-&#xD;
derness, yet almost as deep-and, taking&#xD;
her hands, led her up-stairs and into the&#xD;
very room where they had parted yes-&#xD;
terday. By that time she felt that some&#xD;
terrible blow was hanging over her, and&#xD;
she looked at him in dumb, half-stunned ex-&#xD;
pectancy.&#xD;
"Tell me what it is!,, she said, with a&#xD;
sort of strange calm.&#xD;
Then he told her-how, she never re-&#xD;
membered-that there had been a fatal&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
duel, axid that, since she had left the house&#xD;
an hour before, Julian Bomney had been&#xD;
brought into it, a corpse. He told her, but&#xD;
she heard him as in a horrible dream, and&#xD;
the sense of unreality onjy deepened when,&#xD;
before he finished speaking, the dcor was&#xD;
burst open, and a figure, terribk as the&#xD;
avenger of blood, rushed in upon her; a&#xD;
voice, awful as the voice of final judgment,&#xD;
poured out frantic imprecations on her&#xD;
head, and bade her know herself a mur-&#xD;
deress!&#xD;
How the scene ended, she neverknew;&#xD;
for all sights and sounds were soon merged&#xD;
into merciful nothingness. Horror, an~&#xD;
guish, remorse, came too heavily on the&#xD;
worn braijri and exhausted heart. She lis-&#xD;
tened, without answer or appeal, to tile&#xD;
avalanche of accusation and reproach that&#xD;
never in all the years of life would cease to&#xD;
haunt her; and then, when others inter-&#xD;
fered, when her grandfather came and gen-&#xD;
tly forced his wife away, she looked up at&#xD;
Maurice Darcy with an expression of de-&#xD;
spairing misery which he never forgot, and&#xD;
fell heavily forward in a deep swoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
LE BEAU coNFflDflEfl.&#xD;
A uosy-w~n~ sunset in the south of&#xD;
France, a white chAteau hanging like an&#xD;
eagle's nest, half-way down a rocky slope,&#xD;
with a sunny valley below it, and a glorious&#xD;
mountain-range behind, a village nestling&#xD;
amid the trees beneath, a gray church-tow-&#xD;
er looming against the evening sky, a per-&#xD;
vading sense of all things soft and fragrant&#xD;
in the atmosphere, and a group-rather so-&#xD;
cial than gay-drinking their after-dinner&#xD;
coffee on the chAteau terrace, with the&#xD;
golden light failing through the leaves and&#xD;
marking many a flickering tracery of spray&#xD;
and tendril on the white dresses which two&#xD;
of the ladies wore.&#xD;
Foremost in this group was General&#xD;
Aylmer's soldierly figure and handsome&#xD;
face, the latter looking scarcely a day older&#xD;
for all the trouble and difficulty which had&#xD;
encompassed him before he drifted tempo-&#xD;
rarily into this quiet haven of rest. It was&#xD;
right hard, the general thought, that the&#xD;
perversity and folly of other people should&#xD;
fall on his shoulders, as if he had not&#xD;
worries enough and to spare of his own!&#xD;
But, then, his conscience said something to&#xD;
him concerning his. own share in the&#xD;
unpleasant matter. He remembered how&#xD;
much averse his daughter had been to the&#xD;
visit which ended so disastrously; he re-&#xD;
membered that she had gone to Baltimore&#xD;
only at his solicitation, and,~as he was the&#xD;
farthest in the world from a brute, he had&#xD;
&#xD;
put a very sensible constraint on himself&#xD;
and did not betray, by word or tone, the&#xD;
deep irritation which was perhaps his pre-&#xD;
dominant feeling toward everybody con-&#xD;
cerned-toward his father-in-law, for the&#xD;
absurd quixotism which had been at the&#xD;
root of the whole imbroglio; toward his&#xD;
daughter, for her obstinacy and wayward-&#xD;
ness; toward the unhappy boy, whose ill-&#xD;
fated passion had hurried himinto a bloody&#xD;
grave; but chiefly toward that man who&#xD;
was fighting far away under the tropic sun,&#xD;
with only the hard blows and poor pay of a&#xD;
soldier of fortune-the man whom Valerie&#xD;
Aylmer had never seen since she sank down&#xD;
at his feet on that awful day, the shadow&#xD;
of which was upon her yet.&#xD;
For no ono, looking at her as she leaned&#xD;
over the terrace balustrade in her. sweep-&#xD;
ing, ~white draperies, could have found one&#xD;
trace of the radiant charm that had kindled&#xD;
the fame of La belle des belles amid the&#xD;
orange-groves of distant Louisiana. Not&#xD;
that she was faded, but rather, that a sort&#xD;
of cloud had come over her. The beauty&#xD;
of feature, the 'clearness of tint, and the&#xD;
softness of glance, were still hers, even de-&#xD;
spite the long illness which had prostrated&#xD;
body and mind after the shock of Julian&#xD;
Romney's tragical death. But a subtle&#xD;
something had gone from her face, and&#xD;
there were ~iot wanting candid friends who&#xD;
declared' that in this very something lay the&#xD;
spirit and essence of her beauty. They&#xD;
made a point of placing the blame of it on&#xD;
her illness; but Valerie herself knew bet-&#xD;
ter. She knew that the change had struck&#xD;

VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
deeper than the mere outside garb of hu-&#xD;
manity; that an ineffaceable brand had been&#xD;
set upon all the fair freshness of her life;&#xD;
and that the woman who rose up from her&#xD;
sick-bed to bear existence and its stern bur-&#xD;
den of remorse, could never be one with&#xD;
the girl who had cast herself in passionate&#xD;
despair down upon it. It was in compliance&#xD;
with her own request that, immediately af-&#xD;
ter her recovery, General Aylmer took her&#xD;
abroad. "I want to see Eugene," she said,&#xD;
wistfully, "and I want to leave Amcrica% so&#xD;
far behind that I need never think of 3t&#xD;
again. Please, papa, let us go to France."&#xD;
So to France they went-to that sunny Pro-&#xD;
vence where Valerie's ancestorshad lived and&#xD;
died for countless generations, and where the&#xD;
young Confederate was supposed to b~ hard&#xD;
at work surveying a new line of railway.&#xD;
Gerald was perfectly competent to take care&#xD;
of every thing at home; so the general&#xD;
rented a modest chateau near Eugene's scene&#xD;
of labor, and settled himself for a temporary&#xD;
residence, hoping that the soft air and sunny&#xD;
smiles of this fair region might bring back&#xD;
health to his daughter's pale cheek-the&#xD;
cheek which was such a serious discomfort&#xD;
to a man who had a profound horror of&#xD;
gloom or sadness iii any shape. He also con-&#xD;
sidered that perhaps cheerful associates&#xD;
might do something toward making Valerie&#xD;
herself again; so he urged her to write to&#xD;
Allx ]I~ivbire, then in Leijfsic, and invite her&#xD;
to pay them a visit.&#xD;
"Poor little Alix! I know she will&#xD;
be glad enough to come," Valerie said,&#xD;
thinking more of the home-sick child than&#xD;
of herself; so she wrote the invitation,&#xD;
which was eagerly accepted - very much&#xD;
to Miss Fane's disgust. For, strangely&#xD;
enough, as it may seem, and yet it was not&#xD;
strange at all, Netta had accompanied her&#xD;
friend abroad. "You need somebody to take&#xD;
care of you," said this experienced friend,&#xD;
"~ind you must have somebody-for what is&#xD;
aman? I am old enough to do as I please,&#xD;
you know, and, thank Heaven, I have enough&#xD;
fortune left to pay my passage; so you need&#xD;
not say a word, Valerie-I am going." And&#xD;
Valerie, weary and sick, could only smile&#xD;
in the bright, tender face, and answer, "I&#xD;
haven't the least desire to say a word, dear.&#xD;
&#xD;
Themere sght of you is good for me; and&#xD;
I would rather hedi~ this news than any other&#xD;
in the world." So the warm-hearted Louisi-&#xD;
anian, who was, as she said, old enough to&#xD;
go her own way without molestation1 who&#xD;
was an orphan of moderate fortune, and who&#xD;
loved Valerie Aylmer better than she did her&#xD;
own sisters, packed her trunk, and an-&#xD;
nounced her intention so decidedly that no-&#xD;
body even thought of offering any opposition.&#xD;
She could not help being disgusted, however,&#xD;
when she heard that Alix Rivi~re had been&#xD;
summoned to share their retreat; and she&#xD;
absolutely reproached Valerie for yielding&#xD;
the point.&#xD;
"I know you don't want her your-&#xD;
self," she said, "and the general is foolish&#xD;
enough to think we can be 'cheered' by&#xD;
a child with her head full of ehzftbfl8 and&#xD;
admirers. She will be bored to death here;&#xD;
and then she will bore us to death, and that&#xD;
will be the end of it. I wish you had been&#xD;
more firm, Valerie."&#xD;
"I don't," said Valerie, in the languid&#xD;
tone which was in such strong contrast to&#xD;
her former brightness; "and you won't&#xD;
either, Netta, when you see her. Her head&#xD;
is no more full of ehijj'ons and admirers than&#xD;
yours is; and, although it will be painful, I&#xD;
shall be glad to see her again."&#xD;
"Painful! Of course it will be pain-&#xD;
ful; " thought Miss Fane, indignantly.&#xD;
"More so than she has any idea herself-&#xD;
poor dear! The general ought to be&#xD;
ashamed of himself; but then I suppose he&#xD;
oan't help it-being a man!" But it was a&#xD;
great relief to her anxiety when she saw the&#xD;
shy, gentle little creature in deep mourning,&#xD;
witJ~ soft eyes and quiet ways, who made&#xD;
her appearance, instead of the vivacious, self-&#xD;
possessed young lady of the period that her&#xD;
alarmed fancy had pictured. In five minutes,&#xD;
she saw why Valerie had made no opposition&#xD;
to this addition to their circle; and, although&#xD;
Alix had arrived only the day before, they&#xD;
were already good friends as they sat to-&#xD;
gether on the terrace, enjoying the close of&#xD;
that bright afternoon.&#xD;
There was only one stranger in the party,&#xD;
and he was leaning back against a broken&#xD;
moss-grown sun-dial, while his bright, clear&#xD;
eyes were roving from point to point like&#xD;
&#xD;
LE I3EAU 4&#xD;
a humming-bird's movements. This was&#xD;
Eugene-Le 1~eau Cor~fiid&amp;amp;~-who had once&#xD;
made no mean fame for himself in the land&#xD;
from which he was now an exile. Like&#xD;
most of his countrymen, he was of goodly&#xD;
stature, and straight as a pine on a Carolina&#xD;
highland, with the small extremities that&#xD;
betoken good blood, and the indefinable ease&#xD;
of manner which attests good breeding,&#xD;
with a cast of feature that was moderately&#xD;
regular, and a complexion that had been&#xD;
originally florid, but was now bronzed by&#xD;
outdoor life to a healthy brown, save where&#xD;
the white brow lay like a snow-drift under&#xD;
the rich waves of brown hair. This hair&#xD;
matched exactly the eyes that always looked&#xD;
frank and sunny-let the brow above frown&#xD;
ever so darkly-and the long trooper mus-&#xD;
tache of the Confederate army-a mustache&#xD;
which might perhaps have been more silken,&#xD;
but could not possibly have been more lux-&#xD;
uriant. Altogether, the young evile was&#xD;
sufficiently attractive, even on the surface,&#xD;
to make it a matter of little wonder that al-&#xD;
most everybody fancied him on first sight,&#xD;
and liked him cordially on second. He was&#xD;
gay and pleasure-loving to a fault, but he&#xD;
had a certain power of concentration not&#xD;
often found united with a mould of charac-&#xD;
ter so much inclining to the volatile, which&#xD;
had frequently stood him in good stead. He&#xD;
was also one of a large class who take very&#xD;
little care of themselves, and of whom For-&#xD;
tune seems fond of taking a great deal-&#xD;
who are continually coming to grief in some&#xD;
unforeseen manner, and, like a cat, continu-&#xD;
ally failing on their feet. These are the kind&#xD;
of people for whom lucky chances abound;&#xD;
and who grow to expect them so confidently&#xD;
that they rarely think it necessary to stretch&#xD;
out a hand to make one for themselves-&#xD;
people who are always missing some good&#xD;
thing or other, that a little exertion wctuld&#xD;
have secured to them, and then being re-&#xD;
warded for this culpable carelessness by a&#xD;
still more golden favor showering down upon&#xD;
their graceless heads-people, altogether,&#xD;
with whom it is impossible not to find con-&#xD;
stant fault, and to whom it is equally impos-&#xD;
sible not to give warm and honest regard.&#xD;
Plainly, the young ex-colonel of artillery,&#xD;
and present sub-surveyor of civil enginee~'s,&#xD;
&#xD;
~ONF~D1~R~.                         165&#xD;
had been accustomed, all his life, to obtain-&#xD;
ing his own way by force of arms, or force&#xD;
of any thing else that was necessary; and&#xD;
plainly, also, he had not changed his habit in&#xD;
changing his position.&#xD;
After the coffee was disposed of, the&#xD;
whole party had been silent for some time,&#xD;
not so much for absolute want of some-&#xD;
thi~ng to say, as from the pleasant indolence&#xD;
which is apt to seize people occasionally,&#xD;
and keep them quiet despite themselves. In&#xD;
accordance with a special request of the&#xD;
ladies, the two gentlemen were smoking,&#xD;
and only a few desultory remarks were ex-&#xD;
changed, a0 the golden light slowly faded&#xD;
from the gray church-tower with its glitter-&#xD;
ing cross, the valley lay in deep shadow, the&#xD;
mountains wrapped themselves about in pur-&#xD;
ple dusk, the sun went "down behind the&#xD;
western hill to die," and only on the terrace&#xD;
still lingered a rosy Claude light that seemed&#xD;
to throw a tone of sentiment over the group,&#xD;
when the diligence came slowly rumbling&#xD;
past on its way to the village. It was a&#xD;
warm, dusty sort of conveyance, and more&#xD;
than one of the tired passengers looked out&#xD;
at the white ehflteau and the pretty home-like&#xD;
scene, as they passed, envying the fair, cool&#xD;
retreat, it may be, and wondering vaguely&#xD;
what aims and interests life held for those&#xD;
to whom so much of life's good things&#xD;
seemed to have fallen.&#xD;
"What strange, uncomfortable things&#xD;
those diligences are I', said Miss Fane, look-&#xD;
ing after the heavy vehicle as it rolled on.&#xD;
"I don't think I shall ever grow accustomed&#xD;
to their appearance."&#xD;
"Yet they seem so much in keeping with&#xD;
every thing else here, that I shall be sincere-&#xD;
ly sorry when Eugene's railroad comes,"&#xD;
said Valerie, without turning round. "I like&#xD;
them 1-they look so quaint and old; and&#xD;
travelling must certainly be pleasanter in&#xD;
them than in steamboats and cars, I should&#xD;
think."&#xD;
"You would not think so, if you had&#xD;
ever tried it," said Eugene, dryly. "How-&#xD;
ever, their day is over-naus a~ons o1iang~&#xD;
tout oe~a. They have only one merit that&#xD;
I know of-the ease with which one can&#xD;
make acquaintances."&#xD;
"That is a merit with every thing, so far&#xD;

&#xD;
as you are concerned, I believe," s4d the&#xD;
general.&#xD;
Eugene shrugged his shoulders in a way&#xD;
he had caught from his French companions,&#xD;
and given a certain expression of his own-&#xD;
a way that spoke a great deal of gay ineou-&#xD;
cianco without any trouble of words.&#xD;
"You are perfectly right, sir," he an-&#xD;
swered. "It's a trick one learns after living&#xD;
a cosmopolitan life some little time. I make&#xD;
it a rule to stand on ceremony with nobody,&#xD;
and you have no idea how amazingly well&#xD;
I find it answer. But then it isn't by any&#xD;
means my monopoly. I thought, for in-&#xD;
stance, I heard a good deal of talk in Paris&#xD;
~about a certain travelling companion with&#xD;
whom you crossed the Channel."&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Miss Fane.&#xD;
"The person of whom you are speaking-&#xD;
our friend of the bover boat, whom we&#xD;
hoped to meet in Paris-was not the gen-&#xD;
eral's acquaintan~aIat all, but Valerie's and&#xD;
mine.-You ren{~mher, de~ar?"&#xD;
"The cripple, you mean?" said Miss&#xD;
Aylmer.&#xD;
"Yes, the cripple-poor fellow!"&#xD;
"Who was he?" asked Alix.&#xD;
"Ind~ed I don't know," answered Miss&#xD;
Fane. "We none of us found Qut any thing,&#xD;
excepting that he was a very charming&#xD;
gentleman, though an almost entirely help-&#xD;
less cripple. You can't tell how pitiful it&#xD;
was to see him lifted about like a child; and&#xD;
he was so young, too-not more than thirty-&#xD;
five or six, I am sure."&#xD;
"Then his voice," said Valerie, breaking&#xD;
in abruptly. "You remember how sweet it&#xD;
was-and his face was so bright and cheer-&#xD;
ful, whenever a paroxysm of pain was not&#xD;
convulsing it."&#xD;
"Poor fellow!" said Alix, with all her&#xD;
heart in her tone. "What was his name?&#xD;
-but I forgot you said you did not know.&#xD;
How much he must have reminded you of&#xD;
one of our dear soldiers! Perhaps he was&#xD;
one of them."&#xD;
"I don't think that is likely,' said Miss&#xD;
Fane. "Indeed, I am sure he was not. I&#xD;
think he must have been an Englishman."&#xD;
"I thought people Were only injured&#xD;
that way in war," said Alix, simply, "like&#xD;
poor Frank Russell, who. was left for dead&#xD;
&#xD;
in th.e trenches of Petersburg, you know.&#xD;
What sort of a wound had this-this Eng-&#xD;
lishman received?"&#xD;
"He was evidently suffering from a&#xD;
spinal injury of some sort," said General&#xD;
Aylmer, "Probably it was only a case of&#xD;
spinal disease," he added, carelessly. "He&#xD;
was very agreeable; and, like Miss Netta, I&#xD;
incline to think that he was an Englishman."&#xD;
"There is one very good proof of it,"&#xD;
said she. "Finding out where we were&#xD;
from, he told me he felt with the Con-&#xD;
federacy deeply, and that, if he had not been&#xD;
a cripple, he would have been in our army."&#xD;
"Beihg a cripple, he could afford to say&#xD;
so," remarked Eugene, who had lived long&#xD;
enough abroad to become very skeptical of&#xD;
such professions.&#xD;
"And that he had a brother in the ser-&#xD;
vice.&#xD;
"Tndecd! But I am sure he did not&#xD;
mention his name."&#xD;
"Eugene, you are one of the people&#xD;
whom Sir Walter Scott classes as vulgarly&#xD;
incredulous," said Valerie, turning round&#xD;
with something of the sunset glow still&#xD;
lingering in her eyes. "Good people, the&#xD;
river mists are rising. Suppose we go into&#xD;
the saloon?"&#xD;
They all agreed with her; though it was&#xD;
hard to leave the sweet outer dusk, with its&#xD;
burnished horizon and silver stars; but when&#xD;
they entered the saloon, where the globe-&#xD;
like lamps showed such bright, clear lustre,&#xD;
and every thing looked so cheerful, they&#xD;
forgot the starlit terrace, and fell to their&#xD;
usual occupations, while Eugene went at&#xD;
once to the open piano.&#xD;
"Come and sing some, Miss Rivi~re," he&#xD;
said. "J have heard so much about your&#xD;
voice, that~1 am prepared for any thing&#xD;
short of astonishment."&#xD;
Alix went at once~-thereby pleasiughim&#xD;
much more than she was aware-and, while&#xD;
she sang one of the charming Scotch ballads&#xD;
which she thought likely to suit a taste that&#xD;
could not be severely classical, the young&#xD;
man leaned against the instrument, study-&#xD;
ing, not the notes that floated in such silver&#xD;
purity past his ear, but the fawn-like eyes&#xD;
and the fair face of the young singer. Gen-&#xD;
eral Aylmer took a budget of I'~ew-Orleans&#xD;
&#xD;
papers over to a side-table, to open at his&#xD;
leisure, while Valerie and Miss Fane sat&#xD;
down to their needlework, and talked over&#xD;
it in low tones, for the length of the room&#xD;
divided them from the two at the piano.&#xD;
It was a pleasant room, barring a cer-&#xD;
tain emptiness of aspect, to which the eye&#xD;
grew accustomed by degrees. The floor&#xD;
was of dark, polished wood, with here and&#xD;
there rich Turkey rugs covering portions of&#xD;
it; the furniture, of ebony and damask, was&#xD;
ancient and massive, and, though moth-eatei&#xD;
in parts, still had a certain faded grandeur&#xD;
of its own. Three or four full-length mir-&#xD;
rors completed all the original furniture;&#xD;
but there were traces of a new rt~gime in&#xD;
the piano-a magnificent Erard-in Va-&#xD;
lerie's work-table, in a flower-basket which&#xD;
was suspended from the large chandelier, in&#xD;
several Parisian cabinets and tables, in the&#xD;
pleasant easy-chairs, and in the books and&#xD;
journals which were scattered everywhere.&#xD;
Altogether, notwithstanding its quaint, old-&#xD;
fashioned aspect, a pleasanter drawing-room&#xD;
need not have been desired-especially on a&#xD;
soft summer evening when the windows&#xD;
overlooking the terrace were all open; and&#xD;
when moonlight and fragrance~ and the soft&#xD;
ProvenQal air came in, together with the&#xD;
distant murmur of the river.&#xD;
"Did you like that?" asked Alix, ceas-&#xD;
ing her song, and glancing up so suddenly,&#xD;
that she quite took her companion by sur-&#xD;
prise, and absolutely made the young&#xD;
gentleman look confused for the space of a&#xD;
second. "You did not tell me what you pre-&#xD;
ferred; and a ballad suits almost everybody."&#xD;
"Yes," he said, hastily. "I liked it&#xD;
very much; and-and my taste in music is&#xD;
certainly not very cultivated. Sing some-&#xD;
thing else, won't you?"&#xD;
"Don't you sing at all yourself?"&#xD;
"I whistle Partant pour Za Syrie-ttiat&#xD;
is all."&#xD;
She laughed. "So that is your taste, is&#xD;
it? I am afraid my sentiment did not suit&#xD;
you, then. I should~have sung something&#xD;
martial-only my repertoire is not very ex-&#xD;
tensive in that line. I learned K3rner's&#xD;
Sword-song the other day, and shocked my&#xD;
maestro very much by singing it for him.&#xD;
But-"&#xD;
&#xD;
She stopped with a suddenness which&#xD;
her companion did not understand, and&#xD;
looked apprehensively toward the other end&#xD;
of the room.&#xD;
"Well," he could not help asking," what&#xD;
is the matter?"&#xD;
"Nothing," she saidhurriedly, and speak-&#xD;
ing very low; "but I forgot-I should not&#xD;
have mentioned that before Valerie. I hope&#xD;
she did not hear me. It would make her&#xD;
think of-of Mr. Romney, who used to sing&#xD;
it; and I would not do that for the world.&#xD;
No; I cannot sing any more just now-after&#xD;
a while, perhaps."&#xD;
She rose as she spoke, and left the piano,&#xD;
Eugene following, by no means well pleased.&#xD;
He could not understand what 'a horrible&#xD;
reality that tragedy was to her, ~which to&#xD;
him had been only a far-off story; nor how&#xD;
vividly: her own words had recalled the&#xD;
memory of Julian Romney's living presence.&#xD;
So, although he followed her to the work-&#xD;
table, where Valerie and Miss Fane were&#xD;
sitting, he did not exert himself to be very&#xD;
companionable, and in fact stood gazing ab-&#xD;
sently out of the window while the others&#xD;
talked of the news from the seat of war-&#xD;
the Prusso-Austrian campaign of '66 was&#xD;
in full jirogress-and especially of the per-&#xD;
sonal items which Charley Hautaine's letters&#xD;
furnished, he being regi.ilarly enrolled in the&#xD;
Austrian service. It was Net1~a's voice at&#xD;
last that roused him from his reverie.&#xD;
"By-the-by, Eugene," she was saying,&#xD;
"I wonder you never looked upon this war&#xD;
as a chance for action-you who, like Char-&#xD;
ley, call yourself condottiere."&#xD;
"Because, unlike Charley, I don't see the&#xD;
beauty or utility of having my brains blown&#xD;
out to settle the Schleswig-Holstein question,&#xD;
or determined whomtheQuadrilateralrlght-&#xD;
fully belongs," answered he, carelessly.&#xD;
"I thought I heard you not long ago'&#xD;
giving your opinion as to whom it rightfully'&#xD;
belongs?"&#xD;
"To Austria? Well and good. Let&#xD;
Austria keep it . then-if she can. I have'&#xD;
neither concern nor interest in the matter."&#xD;
Valerie looked up from her work at the-&#xD;
young man's half-careless, half-scornful face.&#xD;
"I am sorry to see that you are becoming&#xD;
narrow-minded in your sympatbie;" she:&#xD;

168                       VALERIE AYLMER~                                                                SURSUM CORDA.                         169&#xD;
&#xD;
said. "A few years ago, you would have&#xD;
been all interest and fire in this matter."&#xD;
"A few years ago, my dear sister, I had&#xD;
a little surplus sympathy and interest to dis-&#xD;
pose of-oaow I have none. I doubt much&#xD;
if Ismael measured matters by any other&#xD;
than the ego standard; and I and all my&#xD;
kind are Ismaels now. I owe nothing to the&#xD;
world, nothing to civilization, nothing to the&#xD;
rights and wrongs of national quarrels. As&#xD;
an exile and an alien, I stand apart from them&#xD;
all; and who is up or down in the scale of&#xD;
the world, matters little or nothing to me."&#xD;
Alix's soft eyes looked at him in appar-&#xD;
ent reproach. Evidently the little lady was&#xD;
not prepared to endorse this creed; and,&#xD;
meeting her glance, Eugene addressed him-&#xD;
self to her without a moment's warning.&#xD;
£~ You don't agree with me, Miss Rivi~re.&#xD;
Why not?"&#xD;
"I-oh, dear! I am sure I said nothing,"&#xD;
answered Alix, quite taken aback. "I con-&#xD;
fess I don't agree with you, Colonel Aylmer;&#xD;
but then-I'm only a woman, you know, and&#xD;
so my opinion is not of any importance."&#xD;
"I wonder who has been telling you that&#xD;
nonsense?" said the uncivil Eugene. "Of&#xD;
course, your opinion is of importance-of the&#xD;
greatest importance, in fact. Come, let me&#xD;
see if I can't make you agree with mc. Why&#xD;
do you think I'm wrong?"&#xD;
Thus singled out for combat, Alix looked&#xD;
appealingly round at her companions. Argu-&#xD;
ment was not at all her' forte, and she al-&#xD;
ways shirked it if she could. "Oh, please.&#xD;
don't ask me," she said. "Valerie and Miss&#xD;
Fane&#xD;
"I don't care about hearing the opinion&#xD;
of Valerie and Miss Fane," interrupted the&#xD;
still more uncivil Eugene. "I want your&#xD;
own reasons for thinking me wrong. You&#xD;
must have reasons, you know-or else you&#xD;
could not have an opinion. Come, let me&#xD;
shear them! I want to convince you."&#xD;
"Suppose I don't care about being con-&#xD;
vinced?"&#xD;
-"Ret~sonable people always do care, if&#xD;
they are wrong."&#xD;
* Fenced into a corner in this way, Alix&#xD;
had nothing to do bat make the best of the&#xD;
situation, and try to explain herself.&#xD;
"I don't know," she said, "but it seems&#xD;
&#xD;
to me there's such a thing as abstract right&#xD;
and wrong, isn't there? Well, it seems to&#xD;
me as if right was right, and wrong was&#xD;
wrong, the same now as ever; and I think&#xD;
one ought always to feel with the right, and&#xD;
against the wrong."&#xD;
"But suppose you don't take interest&#xD;
enough in the matter to care to find out who&#xD;
is wrong and who is right?"&#xD;
"Then I think you're in a bad way your-&#xD;
self," said she, gravely. "People ought al-&#xD;
ways to ta ore not, they grow to&#xD;
be narro , and selfish, and all that sort of&#xD;
thing, yo know."&#xD;
"The I'm afraid I must bring myself in&#xD;
guilty o being narrow, and selfish, and all&#xD;
that so t of thing!" he said. "Honestly, I&#xD;
don't care a fig who is down or who is up.&#xD;
The nations of the earth stood by silent and&#xD;
apathetic while we were fighting desperately&#xD;
for more than life; and now I should de-&#xD;
spise myself if I raised a voice, far less a&#xD;
sword, for one of them. In fact, I have no&#xD;
care-I don't pretend to say it is right, for&#xD;
it may be a11 wrong-but I have no care for&#xD;
any thing save self-interest."&#xD;
Alix shook her head despairingly. He&#xD;
was all wrong-she felt that instinctively;&#xD;
but she also felt that he was beyond her&#xD;
powers of putting right. "There is such a&#xD;
thing as heroism for the sake of heroism,~~&#xD;
she said, in last appeal.&#xD;
"Perhaps there may be for Bayards and&#xD;
Sidneys and the like," answered Eugene,&#xD;
with the scoff of the nineteenth century on&#xD;
his face. "But I am not a Bayard or a&#xD;
Sidney-in fact, I'm only a commonplace&#xD;
man, who thinks a great deal more of him-&#xD;
self than of heroism in general, or heroism&#xD;
in particular, either. Don't look so shocked,&#xD;
Miss Rivi~re! It's all right that you should&#xD;
believe such things, and I wouldn't shake&#xD;
your faith in them for the world-"&#xD;
"You couldn't," put in she, indignantly.&#xD;
"EI&amp;amp; bien I" said the young cynic, with&#xD;
a shrug of his superior masculine shoulders,&#xD;
"I don't mean to try. But you may con-&#xD;
vince me, if you want to. Will you do so?"&#xD;
"That is nonsense," said Alix, severely.&#xD;
"You think I have only a woman's foolish,&#xD;
visionary idea; and then you talk of my&#xD;
convincing you, who are evidently as obsti-&#xD;
&#xD;
natel~r set in your own way of thinking as&#xD;
possible. It is nonsense!"&#xD;
"Indeed it isn't," said he, smiling.&#xD;
"Only try. I will be very good, I promise&#xD;
you. And indeed I stand sorely in need of&#xD;
missionary labors."&#xD;
"I don't think there's a doubt of that,"&#xD;
returned she, sincerely. And something in&#xD;
her tone made Eugene laugh so heartily,&#xD;
that at last she was fain to join, and from&#xD;
that moment a league was struck, and they&#xD;
were friends.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
SUBSUM cOnDA.&#xD;
Iv was late on the afternoon of the next&#xD;
day, and the sun was throwing long shad-&#xD;
ows across the terrace, and the formal gar-&#xD;
den, that lay on one side of it, when Valerie&#xD;
came forth from the chateau alone, and took&#xD;
her way down to the village.&#xD;
It was not a long walk, for just beyond&#xD;
the gates a small river flashed over its&#xD;
rocky bed, and was spanned by a bridge-a&#xD;
single arch of heavy masonry-which was&#xD;
the beginning or end, as the case might be, of&#xD;
a crooked street. Prom this bridge the view&#xD;
of the surrounding country was beautiful.&#xD;
Not so extensive or varied, not even so pic-&#xD;
turesque a view as might have been gained&#xD;
from any of the heights near by; but full&#xD;
of the alternation and contrast, the half-&#xD;
hidden beauties and snatches of distant&#xD;
loveliness which add so much to the charm&#xD;
of a landscape. It was like a sweet, serene&#xD;
idyl of pastoral love and content~to stand&#xD;
on the dark old arch with the bright river&#xD;
flowing beneath, the vine-clad banks on&#xD;
each hand, the purple mountains rising in&#xD;
the background, the golden fields opening&#xD;
sunny vistas only to be abruptly broken by&#xD;
some stretching belt of dark woods, the&#xD;
quiet village with its gray church-tower&#xD;
below, and over all the blue, intensely blue&#xD;
sky, of this most fair and pleasant nook~. in&#xD;
all the fair and pleasant land of France.&#xD;
That Miss Aylmer was quite well known&#xD;
in the village was very evident. The blue-&#xD;
&#xD;
blouse men whom she met took their pipes&#xD;
from their mouths to salute her-there was&#xD;
scarcely one of the bright-faced women who&#xD;
had not a "Bon. jour, mademoiselle "-and&#xD;
the little children, as she passed, rushed tu-&#xD;
multuously forward to secure a smile or word&#xD;
of greeting. It had been a strange, foreign&#xD;
scene, this village, to the child of the transat-&#xD;
lantic, when she first looked upon it-recall-&#xD;
ing nothing so much as old pictures that&#xD;
she had seen, or the yet more vivid pictures&#xD;
which imagination had drawn from the word-&#xD;
painting of pens that had dipped themselves&#xD;
in all the warm beauty of the south-but&#xD;
already it all seemed as familiar as if from&#xD;
the knowledge of years. All the tall&#xD;
houses, with their green blinds and over-&#xD;
hanging balconies, all the narrow dark ~&#xD;
streets, and all the glimpses of green trees&#xD;
and sunny walks, as some garden-door was&#xD;
left open, had grown as natural to her sight&#xD;
as the landmarks of her native city. Even&#xD;
the Place (once the Place Royal, now the&#xD;
Place Imp~riale), with its restaurants and&#xD;
wine-shops, its shade-trees and benches,&#xD;
together with the beautiful front of its&#xD;
church, had grown to wear a friendly fa-&#xD;
miliarity to her. And there were well~&#xD;
known faces here also-faces that smiled&#xD;
a friendly greeting to the young foreigner,&#xD;
and looked kindly after her, as she crossed&#xD;
the square with her shaft-straight carriage,&#xD;
and sweeping robes of silver gray.&#xD;
Having made the trifling purchase which&#xD;
hadbeenherostensibleobjectincomingtothe&#xD;
village, Valerie went to the church. It was&#xD;
very cool and dark, and a great contrast to&#xD;
the gay, sunshiny square outside, when she&#xD;
drew back the baize door and met a half-&#xD;
dreamy fragrance of incense floating in the&#xD;
quiet air; for it was a salt's day of obliga-&#xD;
tion, and high mass had been celebrated in&#xD;
the morning. A few candles were burning&#xD;
at the side altars; a few women were tell-&#xD;
ing their beads, as they knelt on the stone&#xD;
floor before them, and a golden nimbus&#xD;
poured from one high window over a palm-&#xD;
crowned martyr's marble head! It was all&#xD;
like and yet unlike that distant cathedral&#xD;
by the Chesapeake, or that more distant&#xD;
and yet dearer one to the exile's yearning&#xD;
heart, by the blue waves of the Mexic Sea!&#xD;

170                       VALERIE AYLMER.                                                             SURSUM CORDA.                        171&#xD;
&#xD;
After she had finished her altar-prayer,&#xD;
Valerie went softly up to ~the organ-loft,&#xD;
aiid in a few minutes a flood of melody rolled&#xD;
forth, and seemed to bathe aisle and altar, pic-&#xD;
tures and statues, in a halo as golden as the&#xD;
falling sunshine. What she played, it is im-&#xD;
possible to say; she could not, indeed, have'&#xD;
told herself; for the deep tones of the music&#xD;
slumbering in those mighty pipes seemed&#xD;
to. mass themselves, as it were, into har-&#xD;
monies, and her hands wandered over "the&#xD;
beautiful cold keys," in chords that might&#xD;
have been only recollections of other&#xD;
strains, but that were for the time steeped&#xD;
in herself, and made as eloquent of her own&#xD;
heart as if that heart had found voice in ab-&#xD;
solute words. Louder and fuller rolled the&#xD;
tide of melody, swelling under the stone&#xD;
arches and up to the vaulted roof like the&#xD;
solemn chant of a kneeling host, then dying&#xD;
away into low supplication, like the single&#xD;
cry of some fainting soul! It was evidently&#xD;
an accustomed thing to the women below,&#xD;
for they did not even turn their heads, as&#xD;
the grand notes rolled forth; but pursued&#xD;
their devotions with stolid fervor, while&#xD;
wave after wave of harmony swept over&#xD;
them, and the very air seemed vibrating&#xD;
with the passionful power of the music.&#xD;
And, when a stranger who was standing just&#xD;
inside the door stopped an outgoer to in-&#xD;
quire concerning the musician, he received&#xD;
only a stare, and a surprised" O'~8t made-&#xD;
moieefle la bSlle An~flaise!"&#xD;
This stranger had evidently been strange-&#xD;
ly attracted by the musicfor, moving with&#xD;
extreme difficulty across the floor-he was&#xD;
on crutches-he took his seat immediately&#xD;
below the loft, and quite in the shade of one&#xD;
of its large pillars. There he remained mo-&#xD;
tionless for nearly an hour-remained until&#xD;
the music at last died away like waves ebb-&#xD;
ing and breaking on a barren shore, and&#xD;
silence settled over the church. He sighed&#xD;
then, strangely and wistfully, and only almost&#xD;
as he did so, a light step sounded at his side,&#xD;
and a shimmering dress swept by him tow-&#xD;
ard the open air.&#xD;
Gathering up his crutches, he rose and&#xD;
followed as quickly as was possible. But,&#xD;
with all his haste, he would have been too&#xD;
late for Valerie, if she had not paused on&#xD;
&#xD;
the church-steps to say a few words of&#xD;
thanks to the child who had worked the&#xD;
pipes for her. She was on the point of&#xD;
turning away, when that peculiar noise pro~&#xD;
duced by crutches on a stone pavement&#xD;
caused her to look around, and she sawa&#xD;
man coming toward her whom she at once&#xD;
recognized as the invalid-cripple of the Do-&#xD;
ver boat.&#xD;
People-especially people of very sensi-&#xD;
tive nerves-generally turned away, when&#xD;
they met this man, and said to each other,&#xD;
with a shudder: "What a dreadfully pain-&#xD;
ful sight!" But again there were others-&#xD;
especially th~se who had looked at him long&#xD;
-who felt as if they would ask nothing bet-&#xD;
ter than to look at him forever-for to do&#xD;
so was a grander sermon than ever sound-&#xD;
ed from any pulpit! He was a man who&#xD;
might naturally have been above the me-&#xD;
dium height, and strongly made; hut who&#xD;
was now bent-partly by intense physical&#xD;
pain, partly by the habitual use .of crutches&#xD;
-until he seemed to have lost several inches&#xD;
of stature. From the waist his lower limbs&#xD;
hung in semi-paralyzation; and his gar-&#xD;
ments fitted what was once a man's muscu-&#xD;
lar frame, as if hung on the dry bones of a&#xD;
skeleton. It did shock unutterably to see&#xD;
this, to watch the hands clinch themselves&#xD;
together, and the head bow itself down upon&#xD;
the chest, in some fierce paroxysm of agony;&#xD;
but there could be nothing of such a feeling,&#xD;
nothing even of pity, when the face raised&#xD;
itself again-stamped though it was with&#xD;
the drear signet of pain !-and the great&#xD;
soul looked at you calmly and bravely&#xD;
through the clear blue eyes. A great soul it&#xD;
was !-few greater have ever lived and&#xD;
striven to endure! Most men, seeing life&#xD;
and all life's uses lie shattered before them&#xD;
-all its bright ambition, all its golden&#xD;
pleasure, all its magic love, killed at one&#xD;
sheer stroke !-realizing that death alone&#xD;
would release from an existence of torture,&#xD;
and that to live in the world was to live for-&#xD;
ever apart from the world, most men would&#xD;
have closed such a prospect very summarily.&#xD;
And if the courage to end existence-for, let&#xD;
people cant as they will, it ia a certain sort&#xD;
of courage which suicide requires-had been~&#xD;
lacking, there were yet fewer who would&#xD;
&#xD;
not have sunk into a moody despair that&#xD;
neither hope nor promise could lighten by&#xD;
one ray of cheer. This man had done&#xD;
neither. On the lined face there was a se-&#xD;
rene light, around the mouth a smile so ge2-&#xD;
tIe that "the sweetest lips that ever were&#xD;
kissed "might have envied it, in the eyes a&#xD;
light ever kindly and pleasant, on the brow&#xD;
a patience nothing less than sublime. The&#xD;
face might have been handsome once, but&#xD;
symmetry of outline and freshness of color-&#xD;
ing had forever'departed now-leaving only&#xD;
the noble power, yet nobler fruits of endur-&#xD;
ance, that had laid their own charm upon&#xD;
the wasted lines, and sealed them with a&#xD;
beauty far above the beauty of flesh.&#xD;
As the stranger paused before Valerie,&#xD;
he rested his crutch under his arm, and&#xD;
raised his hand with a sort of cavalier grace&#xD;
that in him was at once inexpressibly touch-&#xD;
ing and inexpressibly charming, uncovered a&#xD;
head where the chestnut curls lay in rich&#xD;
profusion, curls so like those that crowned&#xD;
another head-a head which even then&#xD;
might be sleeping beneath the tropic sod-&#xD;
that Valerie's heart gave one quick throb&#xD;
that nearly suffocated her.&#xD;
"I did not know," he said, in a peculiar-&#xD;
ly soft and musical voice, "that the invisible&#xD;
musician would prove to be my fair travel-&#xD;
ling companion. May I not recall myself&#xD;
to her recollection, and at the same time&#xD;
thank her for the pleasure she has afforded&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
The tone and manner in themselves&#xD;
would have proved a passport to favor; and&#xD;
Valerie at once extended her hand, with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"I am glad to have afforded you pleas-&#xD;
ure, and still more glad to see you," she&#xD;
said, simply and cordially. "This is avery&#xD;
pleasant surprise. I had scarcely hoped we&#xD;
should meet again."&#xD;
The stranger smiled slightly.&#xD;
"I was sure we should-some time," he&#xD;
said. "But I, too, scarcely hoped that it&#xD;
would be so soon, orzso unexpectedly. I&#xD;
congratulate you, however, on finding this&#xD;
lovely provincial nook. It is a favorite re-&#xD;
sort of mine; and I felt, when I arrived last&#xD;
night, a sense of ease and refreshment in the&#xD;
very air."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Last night!" repeated Valerie, with a&#xD;
slight start of surprise. "In the diligence?&#xD;
Excuse me, but it seems so strange !-we&#xD;
saw it as it passed our chAteau, and it made&#xD;
us all think of you. We were talking of&#xD;
you, and wondering about you for some&#xD;
time afterward."&#xD;
"Your chAteau!" said the stranger, and&#xD;
it was now his turn to look surprised. "Do&#xD;
you mean the chAteau just beyond the river&#xD;
.-the one belonging to the De Launay fam-&#xD;
ily? Really, I consider this quite~singular,&#xD;
for I was very much attracted by the ap-&#xD;
pearance of the group on the terrace, and&#xD;
asked old Tonsard who was living there.&#xD;
He told me an English family."&#xD;
"They seem to consider us English&#xD;
here," Valerie said, apologetically. "It&#xD;
seems impossible to make them understand&#xD;
differently; and in truth I am not very sor-&#xD;
ry : I am afraid that, if they knew we were&#xD;
Americans, they might consider us Yan-&#xD;
kees," she added, gravely.&#xD;
"There would be no danger of that, if&#xD;
they had ever seen any of the latter," said&#xD;
her companion, smiling amusedly. "And&#xD;
you are living here, then?"&#xD;
"Yes, we are living here-temporarily,&#xD;
at least-and it enables me to say that we&#xD;
shall be very glad to see you at the chA-&#xD;
teau," she added-" for I suppose you mean&#xD;
to spend some time in our neighborhood."&#xD;
It was a strange invitation to be given&#xD;
so frankly, by a young girl to a man, of&#xD;
whom she knew nothing; but the old hos-&#xD;
pitable habit of her Southern rearing was&#xD;
strong upon Valerie; and then she felt so&#xD;
old and grave, so separated by a deep gulf&#xD;
from her girlhood and all connected with it,&#xD;
that she would scarcely have hesitated if&#xD;
the case had been much more extreme.&#xD;
The stranger looked a little a~tonislmed-he&#xD;
evidently had not expected such a prompt&#xD;
waiving' of ceremony-but the sudden ex-&#xD;
pression that swept ever his face proved&#xD;
how much he was charmed by the grave,&#xD;
gentle dignity with which it had been done.&#xD;
Yet, he did not answer for a moment. In-&#xD;
deed, he hesitated for several moments bed&#xD;
fore speaking; 'then it was rather slowly:&#xD;
"You are very kind, Miss Aylmer.&#xD;
Ah !-" for Valerie started-" you see I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8073-00000087"/>&#xD;
172                          VALERIE&#xD;
know your name. I heard your servant&#xD;
mention it before I saw you, though I think&#xD;
I should have known you instinctively. I&#xD;
have heard a great deal of you, and I had a&#xD;
very fair picture of you in my mind."&#xD;
He had heard a great deal of her! Sure-&#xD;
ly there was nothing surprising in that.&#xD;
Scores of people, whom she had never seen,&#xD;
might have said the same thing; and scores&#xD;
whom she had seen might readily have men-&#xD;
tioned her name to this stranger, and yet-&#xD;
and yet there was no reason for it at all,&#xD;
but she gazed at him with very startled eyes.&#xD;
"You have heard of me?" she repeated.&#xD;
"That is very strange, for I-I hardly think&#xD;
we have any acquaintances in common."&#xD;
He looked at her with something very&#xD;
sad and wistful in his deep.blne eyes. They&#xD;
were walking slowly across the Place by&#xD;
this time, and more than one of the villa-&#xD;
gers, who did not understand the unknown&#xD;
tongue, noticed how singularly preoccupied&#xD;
both of them were. Yet there was nothing&#xD;
morethanusualinthestranger'svoiceand&#xD;
manner when he answered:&#xD;
"You are right. We have no acquaint-&#xD;
ances in common; but I think we possess&#xD;
at least one friend. I did not mean to offer&#xD;
at once the only claim which I can advance&#xD;
on your kindness; but-well, perhaps lt is&#xD;
best after all. Mademoiselle, Maurice Darcy&#xD;
is your cousin, and it has made amends for&#xD;
much misfortune in my life that he is also&#xD;
my brother."&#xD;
The simple words were spoken with so&#xD;
much deep and evident feeling that, for a&#xD;
second, Valerie scarcely realized the fact&#xD;
which they stated. Then a dim memory&#xD;
swept over her of having heard something&#xD;
like this before; of Madame Vacquant hav-&#xD;
ing once said in the agee long ago, when she&#xD;
did not care for Maurice, that he had a&#xD;
brother-a half-brother-who was an im-&#xD;
becile, or a cripple, or something of the&#xD;
sort. And now she knew that this was the&#xD;
man. It came over her with a rush-a sud-&#xD;
den, indescribable sensation of almost joy.&#xD;
It was something belonging to him-some-&#xD;
thing that was his- some link between&#xD;
them, severed though they were-and so&#xD;
there was more gladness than surprise in&#xD;
the tone that said quickly:&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER'&#xD;
&#xD;
"You I-you his brother I"&#xD;
"Yes," the cripple answered, almost&#xD;
sadly. "You would scarcely think it, but I&#xD;
am his brother."&#xD;
They were passing just then under the&#xD;
shade of a tall, dark house with .overhang.&#xD;
ing balconies, where only one or two chil.&#xD;
dren were playing in the door-way; but&#xD;
even these looked surprised to see Valerie&#xD;
pause and turn to her companion-her hand&#xD;
extended, and her eyes shining with the&#xD;
first gleam of pleasure that had flickered&#xD;
into them for many months.&#xD;
"I greeted you as a stranger a little&#xD;
while ago," she said, in a low, quivering&#xD;
tone, "but now I bid you welcome as Mau-&#xD;
rice's brother. I am very, very glad to&#xD;
know you. Tell me something about him.&#xD;
Is he well-is he happy?"&#xD;
"He was well when I heard from him&#xD;
last," the other replied. "But-do you&#xD;
think he is likely to be happy?"&#xD;
"I hoped so," she answered, quickly.&#xD;
"And, indeed, why not?"&#xD;
"Why not?" It was something of in-&#xD;
dignation which came into those honest blue&#xD;
eyes. "Why not? Mademoiselle, you can&#xD;
ask me that?"&#xD;
She smiled faintly, for she knew what&#xD;
he meant, and it seemed strange to her that&#xD;
any one should think she had still any&#xD;
power over the man who had left her with&#xD;
such cold scorn.&#xD;
"Yes," she said; "I asked it in all sin.&#xD;
cerity. There is not, as far as I know, any&#xD;
reason why he should not be happy."&#xD;
"You think that he-he of all men-&#xD;
could cast off feeling like a worn glove?"&#xD;
"No," she answered, a little drearily.&#xD;
"I only think-I only know-that he is&#xD;
what few men are-his own master. I am&#xD;
sure that, if any feeling troubled him, he&#xD;
would put it down under his foot, and it&#xD;
would never stir again. Therefore I hope&#xD;
that he is happy-indeed, I can scarcely&#xD;
doubt it. I only trust, for your sake, that&#xD;
he will soon return. Does he speak of doing&#xD;
so?"&#xD;
Her companion shook his head. "He&#xD;
does not speak of it at all. I hardly think&#xD;
he will return until the fate of the empire is&#xD;
decided-one way or another. He is a horn&#xD;
&#xD;
THlE SIT1VI&#xD;
&#xD;
soldier-my poor Maurice 1-and I would&#xD;
not wish him other than where he is, if I&#xD;
could only be with him. Sometimes I am&#xD;
ungrateful enough to feel it hard that he is&#xD;
there, while I, his younger brother, whose&#xD;
place should be at his side, am here."&#xD;
He spoke almost unconsciously, more as&#xD;
if thinking aloud than talking; and then he&#xD;
caught an astonished look on Valerie's face&#xD;
which made him wonder what he had said&#xD;
to excite it. Her next almost involuntary&#xD;
words enlightened him:&#xD;
"His youngerbrother! Ah, pardon me"&#xD;
(for she suddenly felt her own rudeness),&#xD;
"but it ~&#xD;
"Very strange, no doubt," he said, con-&#xD;
cluding her unfinished sentence. "But,&#xD;
then, it is true, you know. My mother was&#xD;
our father's second wife; and I am much&#xD;
younger than Maurice. Indeed, I fear you&#xD;
will hardly believe me when I tell you that&#xD;
I am only twenty-five."&#xD;
Only twenty-five! She was so much&#xD;
startled, so unfeignedly shocked by this&#xD;
statement, that for more than a minute she&#xD;
could only look at him in awe-struck sur-&#xD;
prise. Only twenty-five-and bearing upon&#xD;
the shoulders of sixty the face of welinigh&#xD;
forty!&#xD;
"Only twenty-five!" she repeated, as if&#xD;
by an irresistible impulse. "Oh, how cruel&#xD;
God has been to you!"&#xD;
The cripple lifted his hat-reverentially,&#xD;
as if he had stood upon a sanctuary thresh-&#xD;
old.&#xD;
"His will be done! "he said, calmly.&#xD;
And in the act and tone was that which&#xD;
humbled her to the dust. There, in the&#xD;
wreck of years and youth, with his dead&#xD;
hopes clinging round him, and the sad vision&#xD;
of his past life rising before him, this man&#xD;
could say, with such sublime simplicity,&#xD;
"His will be done;" while to her all God's&#xD;
bounteous gifts had turned to ashes, and&#xD;
denial of Him in her heart had almost come,&#xD;
because He seemed to deal hardly with the&#xD;
human needs and hunian impulses Himself&#xD;
had created!&#xD;
"I am rebuked," she said, handing her&#xD;
head with strange humility. "And yet I,&#xD;
too, have striven to feel that, for I too have&#xD;
suffered! Oh, if you would only teach me&#xD;
&#xD;
a little at least of' the patience which can&#xD;
enable you to bear so much!"&#xD;
Jie laid his thin, wasted hand down upon.&#xD;
hers. She never afterward forgot that&#xD;
scene-the last golden sunshine streaming&#xD;
through the linden-boughs, or the light on&#xD;
Gaston Darcy's face.&#xD;
"We can all of' us learn the patience to&#xD;
endure any thing that lie pleases to send,"&#xD;
he said. "But that patience is born of&#xD;
love and trust."&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE SILVER LINING.&#xD;
PERHAPs it was only an exemplification&#xD;
of that most merciful law in all God's mer-&#xD;
ciful providence-the law of calm succeeding&#xD;
tempest-which gave some very quiet and&#xD;
peaceful days to the chateau, after this-&#xD;
some days which came very unexpectedly,&#xD;
but were nevertheless welcomed and en-&#xD;
joyed as people only welcome and enjoy&#xD;
things of which they have been long de-&#xD;
prived. At General Aylmer's hospitable&#xD;
entreaty, Mr. Darcy left his village quarters&#xD;
to make a temporary abode with them; Eu-&#xD;
gene came and went, bringing his gay young&#xD;
engineer friends for short visits, which they&#xD;
enjoyed amazingly; Alix brightened into&#xD;
her old self, and listed like a mocking-bird&#xD;
about the quaint old garden and shady&#xD;
courts; the few chAteaux in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood condescended to recognize tl~e new-&#xD;
comers and exchange civilities: while Netta&#xD;
Fane, who was watching all this very sus-&#xD;
piciously, took heart and comfort when she&#xD;
saw how well Valerie bore it. Yet in truth,&#xD;
if she had only known it, Valerie scarcely&#xD;
heeded it at all. The tide of life whi~h sud-&#xD;
denly flowed in upon them was very pleas-&#xD;
ant to every one else; so, even, in her own&#xD;
mind, she did not wish the conventual seclu-&#xD;
sion of the first mouth or two back again;&#xD;
but, naturally enough, the bright faces and&#xD;
the gay tones, the laughter and the happi-&#xD;
ness, jarred upon her; and she drew herself&#xD;
away from it, not outwardly, but inwardly,&#xD;
which is, after all, the better and more com-&#xD;
plete way. She devoted herself to Gaston&#xD;

144  VAERIE AMER.THE SILVER LINING-                                                                            1~&#xD;
&#xD;
flarcy, for the sweet, subtle charm of his&#xD;
beautiful patience, his sunny, even nature,&#xD;
became daily more powerful and more po-&#xD;
tent for good. But the others felt instinc-&#xD;
tively that, though she was among, she was&#xD;
not of them. No one ever knew her fail in&#xD;
a duty of courtesy or hospitality; but be-&#xD;
yond that there was a barrier which seemed&#xD;
to bar further progress. In fact, this was a&#xD;
transition period of Valerie's life, a period&#xD;
when sorrow threatened to deepen into mel-&#xD;
ancholy, and natural remorse into morbid&#xD;
gloom, and when it was well for her that&#xD;
there chanced to be a monitor near at hand&#xD;
to speak gentle counsel and offer kind en-&#xD;
couragement. The first shock of stunned&#xD;
grief was over, the first horror of self-re-&#xD;
proach had given way to calmer reason,&#xD;
but a weary, listless apathy, a deadened tor-&#xD;
por had crept over her, numbing her brain,&#xD;
and chilling her heart into a lethargy from&#xD;
which she felt little desire to rouse herself.&#xD;
Gaston Darcy never did a better deed than&#xD;
when he broke in upon this darkness with&#xD;
his life which was more eloquent than many&#xD;
words. And Valerie listened to him as she&#xD;
would not have listened to any other on&#xD;
earth, for he was not only Maurice's broth-&#xD;
er, he was not only saint-like, in the perfec-&#xD;
tion of his faith and resignation, but he&#xD;
spoke "fts of knowledge." That was the&#xD;
great secret of it. He had suffered. He did&#xD;
not preach as those who, from regions of&#xD;
tranquil security, exhort the quivering soul&#xD;
to hope and courage, but as one who had&#xD;
traversed the dark valley before reaching&#xD;
the heights beyond. Love and trust I The&#xD;
words came to her dimly, With a far-off&#xD;
sound, but 'yet she felt their glory and&#xD;
beauty out of the very depths of herwretch-&#xD;
edness. They had been mere names to her,&#xD;
as, alas! to so many of us, symbols of some-&#xD;
thing transcendental and unattainable-.&#xD;
something only half understood, and wholly&#xD;
unregarded, but now-ah, now ~man love&#xD;
came a~uide and teacher of tha1~Tove which&#xD;
is divine. For, after all, it seems as if these&#xD;
poor hearts of ours are only to be trained&#xD;
upward by props, as if our earthly affec-&#xD;
tions are only the steps by which we climb&#xD;
slowly toward the higher affection that is&#xD;
waiting to absorb all, as if we are taught&#xD;
&#xD;
the knowledge of love by its mortal objects,&#xD;
only that, when they fall away, we may look&#xD;
into our hearts, and, recognizing their infi-&#xD;
nite capacity, their boundless capability of&#xD;
passion, learn the best lesson of mortality-&#xD;
the lesson that finite love is only given to&#xD;
show the depth and mystery of love which&#xD;
is Infinite.&#xD;
Slowly and by degrees, this knowledge&#xD;
came to Valerie, softening her passionate re-&#xD;
pining, lightening her dull, heavy grief into&#xD;
the calm of something like resignation. Yes,&#xD;
her earthly love had at least done her this&#xD;
service-it taught h~r the depths of her own&#xD;
nature as she had never even imagined them&#xD;
before, itmade herrealize the possibility of ab-&#xD;
negation, and sacrifice, and self-forgetfulness,&#xD;
and those like things which the world deems&#xD;
veriest folly, but on which the angels of God&#xD;
look with loving eyes; it waked her from&#xD;
trifles to realities, it killed utterly all the old&#xD;
leaven of vanity and pride, and gave instead&#xD;
that sad, bitter humility which is more&#xD;
fruitful of good than all else whatever, save&#xD;
only God's grace. She accepted the end&#xD;
which had come to all her hopes very quietly&#xD;
-never once dreaming of rebellion after that&#xD;
awful blow which had showed her all at once&#xD;
the depth and darkness of the gulf on which&#xD;
she had trifled so loi~g. She 1-how should&#xD;
she dare to dream of happiness, with the&#xD;
guilt of blood upon her soul; for would not&#xD;
Julian Romney have been among the living&#xD;
if her face had never crossed his path I And&#xD;
would not that memory rise up to haunt her&#xD;
if she could forget it long enough to love&#xD;
and be loved again? No, Maurice was right&#xD;
-right to leave her coldly, almost cruelly, as&#xD;
he had done. She was no fitting wife for&#xD;
him, and the end was better as it was. He&#xD;
had done well to scorn her, well to think he&#xD;
could never trust her again-she deserved it&#xD;
all. Now, at least, she conld offer her hive,&#xD;
her life, her very self, perhaps, some day, in&#xD;
expiation of the bitter wrongs she had&#xD;
wrought, of the cruel use to which she had&#xD;
put her many gifts. Something of this was&#xD;
written on her face one day, as Netta Fane&#xD;
watched it at benediction; and when they&#xD;
rose to leave the church, the twilight gloom&#xD;
of which was scarcely dissipated by the&#xD;
myriad tapers shining like stars on the high&#xD;
&#xD;
altar, and, glancing back from the silver&#xD;
monstrance which had just been lifted in&#xD;
blessing, she said, abruptly:&#xD;
"You know the proverb about every&#xD;
cloud having a silver lining-well, I think&#xD;
that perhaps you will find the lining to yours&#xD;
after a while, Valerie."&#xD;
But she was not prepared for the shrink-&#xD;
ing start which Valerie gave.&#xD;
"Hush!" she said, and her voice thrilled&#xD;
with a strange awe in it through the falling&#xD;
dusk. "Never say that again, Netta-never!&#xD;
If it were only for myself; do you think I&#xD;
should not have found it long ago in the con-&#xD;
viction that I have deserved every thing? But&#xD;
for-for "&#xD;
Since the day of his death, she had never&#xD;
spoken Romney's name, and it was wcllnigh&#xD;
impossible to do so now. But Netta knew&#xD;
what she meant, of whom she was thinking,&#xD;
and Netta gave a great gasp over the knowl-&#xD;
edge. It was hard for her not to speak her&#xD;
mind out on the subject; a much greater&#xD;
self-denial than Vale'ie ever appreciated;&#xD;
for, with all the zeal of a thorough partisan,&#xD;
Miss Fane directed the whole weight of her&#xD;
indignation against the man who had been&#xD;
mad enough and foolish enough to throw his&#xD;
life down at a woman's feet. "He deserved&#xD;
nothing better than to be shot!" thought&#xD;
this stanch friend and advocate; "I only&#xD;
wish I dared tell Valerie exactly what I&#xD;
think of him!'~ But Miss Fane was discre-&#xD;
tion itself-at least on important occasions.&#xD;
She knew that she did not dare to do any&#xD;
thing of the kind; that she would only make&#xD;
matters worse, *uid that Valerie needed to&#xD;
recover the healthful tone of her mind by&#xD;
slow degrees; so she only said: "Look l~ow&#xD;
the lights gleam from the chAteau! They&#xD;
are very home-like and pleasant, don't you&#xD;
think so? And yonder is Alix on the ter-&#xD;
race, I see, with somebody else in attend-&#xD;
ance. Eugene must have arrived."&#xD;
"There is nothing more likely," Valerie&#xD;
said, glancing in the direction indicated, as&#xD;
they crossed the bridget. "Eugene does not&#xD;
seem to find the least difficulty about getting&#xD;
off duty; and his visits are certainly much&#xD;
more frequent since Mix came.~~&#xD;
"Yes," answered Miss Fane, with her&#xD;
dry, shrewd smile. "I think I can con-&#xD;
&#xD;
gratulate you on your future sister-in-law.&#xD;
There are not many people who are as fortu-&#xD;
nate as you will be in this respect."&#xD;
"You mean-?"&#xD;
"I mean, of course, that Master Eugene&#xD;
is in earnest at last, and that Alix seems by&#xD;
no means averse to his suit."&#xD;
Valerie looked at her friend as if a new&#xD;
and strange idea had been suddenly pre-&#xD;
sented to her. "I never thought of that&#xD;
before," she said, simply. And the remark,&#xD;
which was a very true one, proved in itself&#xD;
how deep her preoccupation had been, how&#xD;
little her real self had mingled with the peo-&#xD;
ple among whom she moved.&#xD;
There is a great deal in having the eyes&#xD;
opened to an affair of this kind, however;&#xD;
and, now that Valerie's wore couched, she&#xD;
saw how just Netta's conclusions were. She&#xD;
had seen Eugene so often in love, that it had&#xD;
rather grown to be his normal state in her&#xD;
eyes; but there was no mistaking the fact&#xD;
that this was something more than a com-&#xD;
monplace love-affair with him. She watched&#xD;
him that night-for of course it proved to be&#xD;
himself who had been loitering on the terrace&#xD;
with Alix, in the summer dusk-and realized&#xD;
with amazement how blind she had been.&#xD;
Yes, there was not a doubt of it; the boy&#xD;
was in earnest at last. La lelle de8 belle,&#xD;
who had seen so much of love in her life,&#xD;
was the most unlikely person in the world&#xD;
to doubt the sign-tokens of the familiar pas-&#xD;
sion-the last person in the world not to&#xD;
understand the quick lights and shadows&#xD;
which chased each other over the young&#xD;
~ face at a word from Alix's lips, or the&#xD;
tender gleam in his eyes whenever they&#xD;
rested on that dainty brown head bent over&#xD;
the board where Mr. Darcy was vainly try-&#xD;
ing to teach her the mystery and science of&#xD;
chess. It was quite hopeless, however; and&#xD;
Eugene was very glad when she laid her-&#xD;
self open to an. ignominious checkmate, thus&#xD;
ending the game, and giving him an oppor-&#xD;
tunity to bear her off to the piano, while the&#xD;
general took her vacated seat. Then Valerie&#xD;
still watched them, with a growing wonder&#xD;
over her own previous obtuseness. It was&#xD;
all so plain 1-all Alix's pretty tyranny and&#xD;
Eugene's devoted slavery! So plain that, as&#xD;
she looked, a very pleasant sketch of the&#xD;

VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC8073-00000089"/>&#xD;
176                           VALERIE&#xD;
future rose before her. Alix and Eugene&#xD;
would marry and settle here, the general&#xD;
might go back to Louisiana, if he wi~nted to,&#xD;
but she and Netta would remain. A wing&#xD;
of the chAteau could be fitted up for them,&#xD;
so that when the others took flight-as of&#xD;
course they would very often-their life&#xD;
would flow on all the same. She fancied&#xD;
herself niched in this quiet nook while the&#xD;
great world roared and rushed beyond, and&#xD;
dreamed a life something like the lives led&#xD;
by the chAtelains of old time, a life of serene&#xD;
contemplation, yet active with good works,&#xD;
a life in which she saw the children sh~&#xD;
would teach, the sick she would attend, the&#xD;
charity she would bestow, and, more than&#xD;
all, the peace she would win. For that,&#xD;
after all, was the great point-peace, rest,&#xD;
repose of conscience, quiet of heart, all those&#xD;
things which we possess in anticipation or&#xD;
in retrospection, but rarely indeed in the&#xD;
reality of the present. Valerie went on&#xD;
dreaming of them, however, in time to those&#xD;
exquisite strains of the Moonlight Sonata&#xD;
which Alix was softly playing; and then she&#xD;
started, when, with a crash, the nimble&#xD;
fingers glided into the chords of some mar-&#xD;
tial air for which Eugene had preferred a&#xD;
petition, and smiled us she realized how en-&#xD;
tirely all her fabric of thought had l~een&#xD;
built on a probability-a probability which&#xD;
others besides herself discerned, however;&#xD;
for, when she looked up, Gaston Darcy&#xD;
laughed and said: "Did that abrupt change&#xD;
of measure startle you? For my part, I&#xD;
think I should have asked for a wedding&#xD;
march-I am very fond of Mendelssohn's."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Eugene, who was not at all&#xD;
an indeterminate sort of person, but always&#xD;
knew his own mind perfectly well, had very&#xD;
little objection to anybody or everybody's&#xD;
seeing that he was thoroughly in earnest,&#xD;
and that it would be no fault of his if Alix&#xD;
did not consent to share his adventurous&#xD;
fortunes. He did not entertain much fear of&#xD;
the result, either; for what could be easier&#xD;
than to teach this gentle, confiding little&#xD;
creature the lesson of love which she seemed&#xD;
horn to learn? He could not help thinking,&#xD;
too1.what a fortunate thing it was that he&#xD;
had. not married any one of half a dozen&#xD;
girls with whom he had been on the brink&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
of matrimony in the past, but that Fate had&#xD;
reserved him for such a happy fortune as this.&#xD;
"She suits me as nobody ever suited me&#xD;
before," he thought. "She is a perfect little'&#xD;
pearl-so exquisitely dainty and refined,&#xD;
that it is impossible that she could be im-&#xD;
proved. There is such an air of repose, too,&#xD;
in every thing she does; and she never of-&#xD;
fends by a loud tone or an awkward move-&#xD;
ment, like these dreadful prononc~ women&#xD;
who have become the fashion of the day.&#xD;
Her profession is the only drawback, and I&#xD;
would soon put an end to all that. It is&#xD;
hard enough to think that she ever was&#xD;
subjected to such a trial, my poor little&#xD;
flower!"&#xD;
The poor little flower, however, was by&#xD;
no means of his way of thinking on this&#xD;
point, and many were the battles to which&#xD;
their difference of opinion gave rise. "You&#xD;
are illiberal; you have no culture," Alix&#xD;
would say, indignantly. "You don't know&#xD;
any thing about how an artist feels toward&#xD;
art. I love music for music's sake, and not&#xD;
for the fame and the noise you talk about.&#xD;
The people who go to hear me sing don't&#xD;
think of me-they think of my voice, and&#xD;
that is what I think of too."&#xD;
"I don't care what they think of;" Eugene&#xD;
would retort; "but it is not a fit place for you.&#xD;
And if I had been your-your brother, you&#xD;
never should have set your foot on any stage&#xD;
under heaven-no, not for an hour 1"&#xD;
"I am very glad you were not my brother,&#xD;
then," Alix would say. And, as Eugene could&#xD;
not honestly declare that he was sorry, the&#xD;
matter generally ended there. Apart from&#xD;
this subject of dispute, they might be said to&#xD;
get on very smoothly, however; and mat-&#xD;
ters certainly looked very much as if Va-&#xD;
lerie might soon be called upon to welcome&#xD;
a sister-in-law whom she could thoroughly&#xD;
love and approve-a gift of fortune which, as&#xD;
Miss Fane very sensibly said, not many peo-&#xD;
ple are lucky enough to possess.&#xD;
This evening, like many evenings which&#xD;
had gone before, was a very golden one to&#xD;
the young Confederate. He had Alix all to&#xD;
himself; with nobody to interfere, to distract&#xD;
her attention, or to make him jealous. The&#xD;
two gentlemen playing chess, and the two&#xD;
ladies stitching away at their needlework,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SILVI&#xD;
were as much apart from the two at the&#xD;
piano, as if an ocean instead of a room had&#xD;
divided them; 'and, although Alix sung a&#xD;
snatch of song now and then, it was impossi-&#xD;
ble not to perceive that music played a very&#xD;
small part in their mutual entertainment .&#xD;
They were both very agreeably engaged, and&#xD;
Eugene at least Was in Arcadia-but, even&#xD;
into Arcadia, disturbances sometimes come;&#xD;
and his, if he had only been able to foresee&#xD;
it, was not far off. When he bade Alix good-&#xD;
night at the end of the corridor that evening,&#xD;
he did not know that he was also bidding&#xD;
adieu to all the tranquil charm of their inter-&#xD;
course- and perhaps it was as well for him&#xD;
that he did not. At least we are told to&#xD;
be thankful that "Heaven from all mortals&#xD;
hides the book of fate," and there is no doubt&#xD;
but that Eugene's slumbers would scarcely&#xD;
have been so sound, his dreams scarcely so&#xD;
sweet that night, if he had eveu faintly&#xD;
guessed what the next day had in store for&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Yet the next day passed away very much&#xD;
like most days until near its close. The&#xD;
ladies spent the morning on the terrace, tri-&#xD;
fling over their sewing and embroidery;&#xD;
while Mr. Darcy and Eugene read aloud to&#xD;
them by turns froni a volume of B6ranger's&#xD;
which the latter had brought. "You talk&#xD;
about poetry," he said, one day. "I will&#xD;
show you something which is worth all that&#xD;
stuff of Lamartine and Hugo put together!"&#xD;
So he made his appearance with those stir-&#xD;
ring verses which in their day electrified all&#xD;
young France. They did a good deal to&#xD;
electrify the company that heard them that&#xD;
morning, and the ringing measure was still&#xD;
echoing in Valerie's mind when she went&#xD;
to dress for dinner. It reminded her of&#xD;
Hautaine, who had once been very fond of&#xD;
B6ranger, too and as she fastened her col-&#xD;
lar, and smoothed her hair, she could not for'.&#xD;
bear a sigh over the gallant young free lt~nce&#xD;
who had loved her so long and so well.&#xD;
"Poor Charley! I wonder where lie is, and&#xD;
what he is doing?" she thought. "I wonder&#xD;
if he has quite forgotten me; and I wonder,&#xD;
too, if he has come to any harm in these&#xD;
dreadful battles? I am sure I{etta must be&#xD;
very uneasy. I will ask her about him this&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
EIR LINING.                        177&#xD;
So that evening, when they were alone&#xD;
on the terrace, while the gentlemen were&#xD;
still lingering over their wine, and Alix had.&#xD;
wandered down into the garden, Valerie&#xD;
mooted the subject. "I have not heard you&#xD;
speak of Oharley for a long while, 1~Tetta.&#xD;
Have you heard nothing from him, or-or&#xD;
about hun?"&#xD;
"Kothing whatever," answered Miss&#xD;
Fane, sadly. "I have not spoken of it, Va-&#xD;
lerie, because I did not care to distress you;&#xD;
but I am very seriously uneasy, and neither&#xD;
the general nor Eugene gives me much en-&#xD;
couragement. The people at home look to&#xD;
me for news of him, and what can I say?-&#xD;
We have not heard from him since Sadowa,&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
"But we would have heard if-if any&#xD;
thing had befallen him."&#xD;
I~etta shook her head. "Hardly. Ha was&#xD;
a foreigi~er, and so entirely unknown. Your&#xD;
father wrote to Vienna the other day, and,&#xD;
until we hear from there, I still venture to&#xD;
hope. He may have been only wounded, or&#xD;
-or something of the sort. I have come to&#xD;
counting on that now."&#xD;
"Yes," Valerie said, almost under her&#xD;
breath-for they both knew only too well&#xD;
what "counting' on that" meant-and then&#xD;
she laid her head down on the stone balus-&#xD;
trade. "God help us! ~ 'her cry. "It&#xD;
is so' terrible! The shadow of blood seems&#xD;
upon all things. 'The whole earth is rock-&#xD;
ing and ringing with the tramp of armed&#xD;
men; and, after hearing of battles and~sieges&#xD;
all day, I dream at night of wounded men&#xD;
and gi~astly corpses, of blood, and carnage,&#xD;
and death, until I wake up sick and shud-&#xD;
dering."&#xD;
"And the effect is very visible," said&#xD;
Miss Fane. "Do you know that, instead of&#xD;
regaining your healthful looks, you are daily&#xD;
growing more pale, more hollow-eyed, more&#xD;
unlike yourself?"&#xD;
"~o," was the indifferent answer, "I&#xD;
did not know, but I can believe it."&#xD;
"Valerie," said her friend, abruptly,&#xD;
"you are thinking, not of Prussia, 'but of&#xD;
Mexico."&#xD;
"And how can I help it?" said Valerie,&#xD;
wearily. "Did not I jend him there? If'&#xD;
ho i~ killed, will' it not be ray work? Will&#xD;

one thing, Netta-it is no lovesick regret&#xD;

"But no other danger would be my fault&#xD;
-no other would make his death my work.&#xD;
You don't know what remorse is, Netta-&#xD;
indeed, how should you? But, if you had&#xD;
ever suffered for one hour what I have suf-&#xD;
~fered for months past, you would not won-&#xD;
der that I pray to be spared its increase, at&#xD;
any cost."&#xD;
Her friend looked at her wistfully.&#xD;
Then a sudden impulse made her lay her&#xD;
hand down on that bowed head. "Your&#xD;
prayers will be heard," she said, almost&#xD;
solemnly, "I am sure of that. God tries&#xD;
us severely, sometimes, but never beyond&#xD;
our strength. And He is not like us poor&#xD;
mortals-He never forgets mercy in jus-&#xD;
tice."&#xD;
As she spoke the last words, the gentle-&#xD;
men stepped through one of the dining-&#xD;
room windows, and came across the terrace&#xD;
to join them. General Aylmer and Mr.&#xD;
Darcy walked slowly in advance..-move-&#xD;
ment was very painfully difficult to the&#xD;
latter-while Eugene followed with the&#xD;
cai'eless, swinging tread that took him over&#xD;
ground so easily, and would have proved a&#xD;
fortune to a professional pedestrian. One&#xD;
glance was enough, to satisfy him that the&#xD;
terrace lacked its chief attraction; so he&#xD;
sauntered off to the garden, whistling, as he&#xD;
went, his favorite gallop. Mr. Darcy sank&#xD;
int'o one of the chairs which were always&#xD;
ready placed, and laid his crutches on the&#xD;
grass beside him.&#xD;
"This is really charming," he said, with&#xD;
his pleasant smile. "I never grow weary&#xD;
'of the beautiful view we have from this&#xD;
spot; and I cannot help fancying that our&#xD;
group is no inconsiderable addition to it.&#xD;
We make a very picturesque effect, I am&#xD;
sure; and it is only a great pity that Mau-&#xD;
rice is not here to sketch us."&#xD;
&#xD;
lie often spoke of his brother thus-al.&#xD;
ways with a lingering accent of tenderness&#xD;
on the name-and Valerie had grown quite&#xD;
accustomed to the allusions. She rarely&#xD;
answered them, however, but, as in the&#xD;
present instance, left some one else to 'do&#xD;
so.&#xD;
"Your brother must be a very fine ar-&#xD;
tist," said Miss Pane. "I have heard a '~&#xD;
great deal of his pictures-though I have&#xD;
only seen one of them."&#xD;
"You have seen one, then?" said Mr,&#xD;
Darcy, lifting his head, which a spasm&#xD;
of pain had lowered while she spoke.&#xD;
"What was it?"&#xD;
But to this simple question, Miss Pane&#xD;
made no reply. She found that she had&#xD;
betrayed herself unwittingly, and she&#xD;
directed: a half-frightened, half-apologetic&#xD;
glance at Valerie, who, after a moment's&#xD;
hesitation, answered in her stead:&#xD;
"It was a picture which Maurice paint.&#xD;
ed for grandpapa, and which I have, that&#xD;
Netta has seen-a portrait of myself."&#xD;
"Indeed I" Mr. Darcy's gentle eyes,&#xD;
which were yet very keen ones, looked at&#xD;
her intently for a moment; then he said,&#xD;
with a smile: "I wonder if Maurice did&#xD;
you justice?"&#xD;
"You shall see the portrait if you&#xD;
wish," said she, quietly. "Some day, I&#xD;
will have it brought down t6 the snloon for&#xD;
your inspection."&#xD;
"I propose an amendment to that," said&#xD;
her father. "Have it brought now, and we&#xD;
can inspect it while drinking our coffee."&#xD;
~&#xD;
"Why ndt? Do you keep it in any inac-&#xD;
cessible place?"&#xD;
"No; certainly not," she answered,&#xD;
flushing slightly. Then she turned to the&#xD;
servant who was handing coffee: "Bap-&#xD;
tiste, go and tell Panchette to give you the&#xD;
picture which is in my dressing-room. It&#xD;
has only been out of its packing-case once&#xD;
-for Netta to see-since we came here,"&#xD;
she added, turning again to Gaston.&#xD;
Before many minutes elapsed, Baptiste&#xD;
reappeared, bearing the canvas, which was&#xD;
only cabinet size, and, therefore, no great&#xD;
burden. By Miss, Pane's direction, he&#xD;
paused some distance from them, and held&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
TEE HIDDEN SKELETON.                   1'T9&#xD;
&#xD;
it aloft. After two ror three shifting of&#xD;
position, a good light was finally secured,&#xD;
and then the glowing beauty, with her&#xD;
dreamy eyes and brilliant tints, looked&#xD;
down from her curtained opera-box upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Now; is it not admirable?" cried&#xD;
Netta, triumphantly. "Is it not herself?"&#xD;
The general rose and came forward-ad-&#xD;
justing his eye-glass as he did so. He was&#xD;
an excellent art-critic, and they all felt that&#xD;
a certain responsibility rested upon hi~ de-&#xD;
cision. Perhaps he felt this himself; for,&#xD;
when he came within proper range of the&#xD;
picture, he said "Hum! "in a way peculiar&#xD;
to him, a way as of one startled into reluc~&#xD;
tant admiration; and then he stood still,&#xD;
and gazed intently on Maurice Darcy's hand-&#xD;
iwork.&#xD;
"It is excellent" he said at last~ rather&#xD;
slowly. "I had no idea that Captain Darcy&#xD;
was nearly so good an artist. Not that I&#xD;
ever saw any of his productions; but still&#xD;
-those flesh tints are singularly transpar-&#xD;
ent," added he, breaking suddenly into&#xD;
criticism. "I never saw any thing better,&#xD;
although he has too much warmth of color-&#xD;
ing-a sort of Gorgione dash which is&#xD;
hardly-"&#xD;
"You forget that Valerie's complexion&#xD;
was not then what it is now," interposed&#xD;
Valerie's friend, rather indignantly.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," said the general,&#xD;
courteously, "but I was not thinking of&#xD;
Valerie's complexion at all; I was dealing&#xD;
with the picture, as a picture. The fore-&#xD;
shortening is admil~able, too. The only&#xD;
thing, in fact, to which it is possible to ob-&#xD;
ject, is that heightening effect obtained by&#xD;
means of__"&#xD;
"But as a portrait, sir," said Netta, who&#xD;
~vas terribly uncultivated, and cared noth-&#xD;
ing whatever about tints, tones, and effects.&#xD;
"What do you think of it as a portrait?"&#xD;
"I think it is grossly flattered," said the&#xD;
general, who did not fancy such remorseless&#xD;
interruption.&#xD;
But meanwhile Gaston Darcy had not&#xD;
spoken. He sat quite motionless in his&#xD;
chair, gazing so earnestly, so almost mourn-&#xD;
fully on the canvas, that at last Valerie laid&#xD;
her haiid softly. on his arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And what do you think of Maurice's&#xD;
work?" she asked, as he turned to her.&#xD;
There was a moment's pause-a pause&#xD;
in which he looked from original to copy,&#xD;
and from copy back to original. Then-&#xD;
"What do I think of it?" he repeated,&#xD;
sadly. "I think there in a heart-throb in&#xD;
every stroke."&#xD;
Before the bright blood had died away&#xD;
from Valerie's face-the blood which quick-&#xD;
ened her resemblance to the picture till&#xD;
even the general could have found no fur-&#xD;
ther fault with the Gorgione dasl~-.-.she&#xD;
heard a quick cry, whether of joy or pain it&#xD;
was impossible to tell, and Netta Pane's&#xD;
white dress went by her like a flash.&#xD;
They all turned simultaneously in the&#xD;
same direction, and there, coming along the&#xD;
terrace toward them, was a soldierly-looking&#xD;
man in undress uniform,' with his arm in a&#xD;
sling- a man whom Ketta was eagerly&#xD;
bounding to meet; and as they looked she&#xD;
threw her arms round him with these glad&#xD;
words of welcome:&#xD;
"Charley !-my own dear Charley! Is&#xD;
it indeed you?"&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE HIDDEN SKELETON.&#xD;
If was indeed Charley Hautaine-but&#xD;
Charley Hautaine looking the mere shadow&#xD;
of his former self. A hollow-eyed, wanted&#xD;
ghost, bearing the traces of long illness on&#xD;
his pale face, where the eyes shone un-&#xD;
naturally large and dark, and of a painful&#xD;
wound in the disabled arm, which hung usO-&#xD;
less in its sling.&#xD;
When l{etta's greeting had a lilttre sub-&#xD;
sided, he found General Aylmer's cordial&#xD;
welcome ready for him, together ~1th Va-&#xD;
lerie's outstretched hands and eager vOiCe.&#xD;
"Oh, (Jharley, dear friend, I am so glad&#xD;
to see you' again!" she said.&#xD;
"But, my poor boy ~ cried ~etta,&#xD;
~hovering between tears 'and lt~ughter;&#xD;
"how badly he looks!--Aiid your arm,&#xD;
Charley !-what is the matter with your&#xD;
arm?"&#xD;
"A bullet is, or was, the matter with&#xD;

&#xD;
it," said Charley, laughing as people do&#xD;
laugh in the very midst of agitation. "A&#xD;
souvenir of Sadowa-I only wish it had&#xD;
been the worst!"&#xD;
"And what could be worse?" asked&#xD;
she, breathlessly.&#xD;
"An attack of fever in a prison hospital.&#xD;
Don't you think so?"&#xD;
Then they overwhelmed him with a&#xD;
storm of questions. Where had he been I-&#xD;
what had he 1~een doing I-had he been&#xD;
taken prisoner?&#xD;
"I am a prisoner on parole now," he re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
"A parole that don't signify much," said&#xD;
the general. "The war is virtually ended."&#xD;
"I suppose so," the other answered.&#xD;
"It is just my luck to be always caught on&#xD;
the losing side! I did want to thrash those&#xD;
rrussians, if only to feel myself oncemore&#xD;
having the best of it-but Fate was against&#xD;
me, as well as against Austria! I have&#xD;
heard, however, that sympathy is a balm for&#xD;
every ill-and, I hope, I am sure of that&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Sure of any amount of it," said Va-&#xD;
lerie, warmly. "But come! we must not&#xD;
keep you standing here, and you looking so&#xD;
pale and tired. We are just taking our&#xD;
coffee; but I shall order something more&#xD;
substantial for you."&#xD;
"I have already dined," he said; "and,&#xD;
if you wrn allow me, I will only join you in&#xD;
your coffee. how delightfully pastoral you&#xD;
look!"&#xD;
"Yes, we have dancedd upon a pleasant&#xD;
home," she said, as she led him forward to&#xD;
the spot where Mr. Darcy and the coffee,&#xD;
Baptiste and the picture, had been left to&#xD;
keep each other company. The latter was&#xD;
amusing himself by an open-mouthed stare&#xD;
at the stranger whom the whole family had&#xD;
rushed to greet in such an effusive manner,&#xD;
while the former was sitting quite still, with&#xD;
his head bent forward on his chest in the&#xD;
manner usual with him.&#xD;
"We have another-a new friend with&#xD;
us," said Valerie, as they advanced.&#xD;
And, just as she spoke, the cripple slowly&#xD;
lifted his head, and turned his face to them.&#xD;
If that face had been one from the dead, its&#xD;
effectupon Oharley Hautaine could scarcely&#xD;
&#xD;
have been more startling. For a second he&#xD;
recoiled, and stood gazing mutely-a mingled&#xD;
astonishment and anguish in his eyes-then&#xD;
he uttered one cry so low and hollow that,&#xD;
involuntarily, Valerie's hand fell from his&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"My God!&#xD;
The pause of the next moment might al-&#xD;
most have been felt, it was so deep, and yet&#xD;
so short. ~o short that General Aylmer&#xD;
and Netta had not reached them when,&#xD;
after making a sign to Baptiste for his&#xD;
crutches, Mr. Darcy rose and limped for-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
"Come with me a moment," he said to&#xD;
Hautaine. Then to Valerie, "You will ex-&#xD;
cuse us-we shall not be long."&#xD;
And the first th~ng she knew, she was&#xD;
standing alone, gazing in dumb amazement&#xD;
at the two men slowly moving away. It&#xD;
was something more than strange, such&#xD;
conduct; but still she managed to quiet the&#xD;
astonishment of the others, when they came&#xD;
up, or at least to restrain its expression.&#xD;
They were evidently old friends, she said,&#xD;
and Mr. Darcy had probably something of&#xD;
importance to tell Charley. They bad said&#xD;
they would not be long. But there was an&#xD;
awkward sense of mystery in the air, de-&#xD;
spite this plausible statement; and very little&#xD;
use in trying to ~conceal that they each felt&#xD;
curious, far more curious than they would&#xD;
have liked to acknowledge. Conversation&#xD;
languished, for, while each one strove to&#xD;
preserve an appearance of dignified uncon-&#xD;
cern, each in reality watched anxiously the&#xD;
two who had paused not far off, and were&#xD;
talking earnestly. At least Mr. Darcy was&#xD;
talking earnestly. His companion listened&#xD;
with bent head, and only occasionally ut-&#xD;
tered a few words, which the lifted hand of&#xD;
the other more than once stayed. But at&#xD;
last the pantomime came to a close, and,&#xD;
turning, they walked slowly back, side by&#xD;
side, to the group waiting for them.&#xD;
"I hope you did not think I meant to&#xD;
abduct your cousin, Miss Fane," said Mr.&#xD;
Darcy, in his usual tone, as he relapsed in-&#xD;
to his fori~aer seat, and allowed Valerie to&#xD;
relieve him of his crutches; "but we are&#xD;
such old friends, Charley and I, that I almost&#xD;
feel as if I had the first claim upon him."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Old friends!" repeated. the general, a&#xD;
little curiously. "Why, how did you two&#xD;
ever chance to know each other?"&#xD;
"You forget that Charley was in the&#xD;
navy, papa," said Valerie, coming to the&#xD;
rescue; "and naval officers knew every-&#xD;
body, I believe."&#xD;
"Gaston and I met in Italy, before the&#xD;
war-our war, I mean," said Charley, who&#xD;
looked many degrees more pale and weary&#xD;
than when Netta had caught sight of him&#xD;
coming along the terrace, twenty minutes&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"You are to drink a cup of coffee imme-&#xD;
diately," said Valerie, turning to him. "I&#xD;
sent Baptiste to order some of Jules's very&#xD;
best; and here he comes with it-for once,&#xD;
just in time.-Papa, don't you think it&#xD;
ought to have a strengthening dash of bran-&#xD;
dy in it?"&#xD;
"Something more than a dash, I should&#xD;
say," the general answered. "Come with&#xD;
me, Charley, and Twill give you something&#xD;
better for your nerves and your looks than&#xD;
even Jules's famous coffee."&#xD;
"I believe I prefer the coffee, sir," said&#xD;
Ilautaine, with a glance at the hand which&#xD;
offered it-a very pretty hand, as all Miss&#xD;
Aylmer's admirers had long since acknowl- 4&#xD;
edged.&#xD;
"Pshaw!" said the unromantic father.&#xD;
"You can drink that afterward, if you 1&#xD;
choose, but I insist on the Otard first. I I&#xD;
have some that is capital."&#xD;
"Go, Charley. You can come back for&#xD;
your coffee," Valerie said.&#xD;
And, with only tolerable grace, Charley&#xD;
went. He looked so much better when he a&#xD;
came back-thus proving the efficacy of the 1&#xD;
general's prescription -that Miss Aylmer t&#xD;
smiled approvingly, as she dropped a lump I&#xD;
of sugar in his cup and handed it to him by c&#xD;
way of reward.                         I&#xD;
The cloud seemed somewhat to pass 1&#xD;
away from them after this, and they sat and ~&#xD;
talked very pleasantly in the rosy sunset a&#xD;
-pleasantly to outwarl appearance, that s&#xD;
is; but Valerie noticed, with a woman's t&#xD;
quick observation,, how deeply Ilautaine's n&#xD;
brow contracted whenever his glance fell on 5&#xD;
Gaston Darcy's bent frame-the frame of t&#xD;
an old man as he sat drawn together in his c&#xD;
&#xD;
large arm-chair-and, when the first one of'&#xD;
the constantly-recurring spasms of pain&#xD;
seized him, Char~ey pushed back his chair,&#xD;
as if by an uncontrollable impulse, turning&#xD;
his eyes away, as he saidwith a'gasp:&#xD;
"I cannot bear it! It is too horrible!"&#xD;
"You will grow used to it after awhile-&#xD;
we have done so," said Valerie, softly. "And&#xD;
he bears it so patiently."&#xD;
"It is not much to bear," said Gaston,&#xD;
who had caught her words, low as they were.&#xD;
And he raised his face, still lined and dis-&#xD;
torted from agony. "I have not learned to&#xD;
suffer and be still yet-that is all."&#xD;
"Don't slander yourself, Mr. Da~rcy,"&#xD;
said Netta, quickly. "I have never heard&#xD;
you utter even a groan."&#xD;
"No-I hope not. But it is quite as&#xD;
inconsiderate to manifest 'pain by gesture;&#xD;
and really I do not suffer-very much."&#xD;
He hesitated a moment before uttering&#xD;
the last two words-words which were al-&#xD;
most sublime. They all felt it; and, from&#xD;
some vague instinct, they were all silent.&#xD;
Nobody contradicted the assertion, though&#xD;
they each knew that, but for' the mighty&#xD;
and beneficent aid of opium, he could&#xD;
scarcely have borne for one day the weight&#xD;
f bodily anguish laid upon him. "Let&#xD;
Liim take as much morphine as he pleases,"&#xD;
a noted physician had once sald to his&#xD;
other. "Its influence will outlast his&#xD;
ife."&#xD;
Then Charley began to ask questions&#xD;
)f the home people, and by degrees the con-&#xD;
rersation drifted to the scenes and the&#xD;
friendss they had left behind in the distant&#xD;
native land, so that, as the shadows&#xD;
lengthened, as the golden light, faded from&#xD;
he gray tower and 'gilded: spire of St.&#xD;
loche, and the soft evening shades began to&#xD;
lose about them, they almost forgot Gaston&#xD;
)arcy's presence, so qtiiet and still he lay&#xD;
ack in his chair, while over the wide&#xD;
raste of tossing water they went back for&#xD;
space to the old scenes, and the bright&#xD;
ky which looks down as lovingly on desola-&#xD;
ion as it ever looked on peace! Familiar&#xD;
iames flashed from lip to lip; allusions, so&#xD;
light that they were almost trivial, brought&#xD;
he quick tear, the ringing laugh. A word&#xD;
r a tone was sufficient to summon up pic-&#xD;

&#xD;
tures on'whieh their eyes would never gaze&#xD;
again. The charm of the old, glad, careless&#xD;
existence swept over them; but it was with&#xD;
that pang, at once so unutterably tender&#xD;
and so unutterablybitter, which stirs with-&#xD;
in us as we stand by the newly-rn de grave&#xD;
of some fair creature whose grace an beauty,&#xD;
gone out of our life, have left i forever&#xD;
desolate! But even as the smiles of the cad&#xD;
come back to us, at once to agonize and to&#xD;
soothe, so that halcyon Long Ago of them-&#xD;
selves and their country started out of the&#xD;
tomb at their bidding-so the laughing eyes&#xD;
and the happy voices came across the gulf&#xD;
of time and the ocean of blood 1-so the green&#xD;
leaves (greener than they will ever be&#xD;
again!) rustled over their heads once more-&#xD;
so the golden sunshine (more golden than&#xD;
any sunshine of to-day!) slept on their&#xD;
path-so the fair faces and gallant forms&#xD;
(there are none so fair or so gallant left!)&#xD;
rose out of their dark resting-places under&#xD;
the cold sod, and the frank hands seemed&#xD;
stretched out across the dark abyss!&#xD;
At last, in a voice half choked with tears,&#xD;
Valerie said:&#xD;
"Friends, let us stop! We feel - we&#xD;
know-~at we, ~exiles though we be, have&#xD;
chosen the better part; but, if we would&#xD;
rest content, let us not talk of home. I, for&#xD;
one, cannot bear it!"&#xD;
"We have certainly talked enough to&#xD;
give us all the blues," Netta said, with an&#xD;
attempt at lightness. "And indeed-but&#xD;
yonder come Eugene and Alix at last!"&#xD;
"Alix! "repeated Hautaine.&#xD;
"One of our own people," Valerie said.&#xD;
"You haven't forgotten the Rivi~res who&#xD;
lived i~t River-view? Well, this is-"&#xD;
"Not the pretty little brown-eyed child&#xD;
I remember, surely I"&#xD;
"Yes, the very same. You will like her,&#xD;
I know."&#xD;
She said this, as the two truants came&#xD;
sauntering slowly up the garden-walk tow-&#xD;
ard the terrace-steps, the last crimson glow&#xD;
from the west giving a warm tinge to the&#xD;
pale-browu curls that fell around Alix's&#xD;
slender throat, and, to the white dress she&#xD;
wore, with its broad black sash. She looked&#xD;
lovely, exceedingly, as she mounted the&#xD;
steps and ptuised a moment in natural sur-&#xD;
&#xD;
prise at seeing a stranger, with one hand&#xD;
still resting on the stone bahistrade.&#xD;
"This is Mr. ilautaine, Alix," said Va-&#xD;
lerie.&#xD;
And Alix, who had heard a great deal'&#xD;
about Mr. Hautaine within the last few&#xD;
weeks, gave a start of surprise and pleasure.&#xD;
"I am very glad," she said, simply and&#xD;
cordially; "and I-~I hope he is not badly&#xD;
hurt," she added, looking at the young man&#xD;
with her shy, sweet eyes full of sympathy ~or&#xD;
his pale face and wounded arm.&#xD;
It was provoking certainly, but before&#xD;
Charley had time to ~ie~nowledge the gentle&#xD;
graciousness of this reception, Eugene, who&#xD;
had lingered a moment behind, bounded up&#xD;
the 'steps and confronted him with all the&#xD;
effusion of that good-fellow welcome which&#xD;
at any other time he would have appreciated,&#xD;
but which, just then, he could not help feel-&#xD;
ing a bore.&#xD;
"Why; old fellow, is this really you?'~&#xD;
Eugene said, full of cordial astonishment.&#xD;
"1 am delighted to see you !-delighted to&#xD;
have this optical evidence that you haven't&#xD;
gone to hobnob with the shades of Alex-&#xD;
ander and Napoleon! But falth, mom ami,&#xD;
you look as if you had come very near being&#xD;
admitted into that illustrious company!&#xD;
What the mischief have you been doing to&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
"He has been wounded, Eugene," said&#xD;
Netta, in a tone of expostulation.&#xD;
"01-has he? Well, I should certainly&#xD;
feel justified in affirming that something of&#xD;
the sort had befallen him. Pray, Master&#xD;
Oharley, have you received your Theresian&#xD;
cross, in recompense of your distinguished&#xD;
services and sufferings for his Imperial Ma-&#xD;
jesty Franz Joseph, yet?"&#xD;
Charley shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Don't twit the unfortunate, thou happy&#xD;
wilder of the compass and lines! When I&#xD;
do receive my Theresian cross, you shall&#xD;
hear of it, you may be sure !-Miss Rivi~re,&#xD;
I am very grateful for your kindness. I&#xD;
don't feel at all as if I needed to be intro-&#xD;
duced to you, I have been so often in your&#xD;
father's house, and I remember you so well,&#xD;
when you were young enough to make me&#xD;
feel quite old in looking at you now."&#xD;
Alix laughed. "That must have been a&#xD;
&#xD;
* good while ago," she said, with an arch nod&#xD;
of her pretty head. "I don't think i'm very&#xD;
young now. But I remember you, too, Mr.&#xD;
Hautaine-at least I think so."&#xD;
"You might do so very easily," Netta&#xD;
said. "But don't you all think we had&#xD;
better go in? It is too lath for Mr~ Darcy to&#xD;
be out-besides, we have another invalid on&#xD;
our list now. So, en avant!"&#xD;
"I would rebel against being made a&#xD;
kill-joy in this style," said Mr. Darcy, taking&#xD;
up his crutches, and preparing to rise, "but&#xD;
that I think the saloon will be better for all&#xD;
of us, and we can hear some music then."&#xD;
"'Stay with me, lady, while you may,&#xD;
For life's so sad, this hour's so sweet;&#xD;
Ah! lady, life too long will stay,&#xD;
Too soon this hour will fleet,"'&#xD;
muttered Eugene, disconsolately. "Are we&#xD;
really going in, like a set of-of insensi-&#xD;
bles?"&#xD;
"We really are," answered Miss Fane,&#xD;
in her short way, that always settled mat-&#xD;
ters. "Mr. Darcy will get sick, and Alix&#xD;
will get a sore throat, if we stay out here&#xD;
any longer."&#xD;
"I'm not at all afraid of a sore throat,"&#xD;
said Alix.&#xD;
"I don't suppose you are-to-night!"&#xD;
their mentress retorted. "But to-morrow&#xD;
you will not fancy croaking like a raven; or&#xD;
taking pepper-tea like a salamander, either.&#xD;
Come, don't be obstinate. Move on!"&#xD;
"One moment," said ilautaine, laying&#xD;
his hand on Valerie's arm, when she rose to&#xD;
follow the rest. "You are not afraid of the&#xD;
mists, are you? Will you give me a few&#xD;
minutes longer out here?"&#xD;
"As many as you please," she answered&#xD;
readily, although her heart misgave her&#xD;
terribly. "I hope he is not foolish about&#xD;
me yet!" she thought. And then she said&#xD;
aloud, "Let us go into the garden and walk&#xD;
a little. It is beautiful down there."&#xD;
It was beautiful down there, for the&#xD;
wild luxuriance of Nature had quite over-&#xD;
grown the trim regularity of art, and the&#xD;
result was one never achieved by a gardener's&#xD;
hand. The moon shone in three-quarter pro-&#xD;
file above the groups of aeaeia4rees, and her&#xD;
light was already beginning to prevail over&#xD;
&#xD;
the soft dusk, and faint, melting outlines of&#xD;
shadow along the paths they tkillowed, while&#xD;
the terrace, with its massive stone balustrade'&#xD;
and large vases, rose behind them, the white&#xD;
chAteau gleamed above, the windows of the'&#xD;
saloon were wide open, and light and music&#xD;
and gay voices floated out together on the&#xD;
still night air.&#xD;
"It is all wonderfully lovely!" Ilautaine&#xD;
said, as they stopped by a fountain, the&#xD;
sparkling waters of which caught the moon-&#xD;
beams, and glittered in them like showers of&#xD;
diamonds. "A man should be a poet on&#xD;
'such a night, and in such a scci~; for, after&#xD;
all, there is a charm about the south of Eu-&#xD;
rope which is only to be felt-never to be&#xD;
described."&#xD;
"No," said Valerie. "For, much as I&#xD;
have always heard and read of it, I did not&#xD;
realize in the least its exceeding beauty un-&#xD;
til I saw it."&#xD;
"And do you think you are settled here&#xD;
for good?"&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"I wish I could think so. I would ask&#xD;
nothing better than to spend my life in this&#xD;
way-but papa has nothing pastoral about&#xD;
him. He likes the world, with all its rush&#xD;
and roar."&#xD;
"So did you once, if I remember rightly."&#xD;
"Did I?" she said, dreamily. "I be-&#xD;
lieve I did; but it is so long ago, I had al-&#xD;
most forgotten about it. At all events, I&#xD;
don't like it now."&#xD;
"Don't you even like Paris ?-yoii, who&#xD;
used to adore New Orleans wWh all your&#xD;
French soul!"&#xD;
"No - not even Paris. When I was&#xD;
there, I only found that it wearied me un-&#xD;
utterably. Papa talks of Rome for next&#xD;
winter, or Naples, or Madrid, or ever so&#xD;
many more places; but I shrink whenever&#xD;
he mentions them, for all I ask is to stay&#xD;
just 'where I am."&#xD;
"I don't understand you," said her com-&#xD;
panion, a little curiously. "Once those very&#xD;
places were the desires of your heart."&#xD;
"I don't understand myself," she an-&#xD;
swered, "unless it be that they are those&#xD;
deferred sugar-plums of existence of which&#xD;
Guy Darrell talks. I longed for them when&#xD;
I could not reach them-i panted for them&#xD;

184                     VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
when they were afar off-and now that they&#xD;
are so near, I feel as if they were the fairy&#xD;
gold that turned to moss and leaves in the&#xD;
grasp.~~&#xD;
There was a pause which remained un-&#xD;
broken for several minutes. They turned&#xD;
into another one of the long, straight alleys,&#xD;
and had nearly reached its extremity, when&#xD;
Hautaine sp6ke, quite abruptly:&#xD;
"Valerie, when I was in Baltimore, I&#xD;
heard that you were engaged to Maurice&#xD;
Darcy."&#xD;
Valerie started-started as if a rude hand&#xD;
had been laid on a bare nerve; but she did&#xD;
not speak for some time. Then she said,&#xD;
slowly-&#xD;
"Who told you so, Oharley?"&#xD;
"It is true, then?"&#xD;
"Never mind about that, just now. Tell&#xD;
me who told you so."&#xD;
"I-I'm not sure that I remember who&#xD;
it was," Oharley said; for instinct taught&#xD;
him better than to mention Julian Romney's&#xD;
name. "I heard it after I saw you. I think&#xD;
my old friendship gives me the right to ask&#xD;
what I sho~ild very much like to know-if it&#xD;
is true?"&#xD;
"It was true," she answered-for her life&#xD;
she could not say more.&#xD;
"You were engaged to him? " -&#xD;
"And-and you are not engaged to Pm&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
Another pause. Then-&#xD;
"I have been fighting against my love&#xD;
for you ever since then," Hautaine said sadly,&#xD;
"and I have been so far successful that I can&#xD;
now say-.I am sorry to hear it is not true."&#xD;
"Then, dear friend," said Valerie, hold-&#xD;
ing out her hand, with a sudden impulse,&#xD;
"somebody did us both a great service. A&#xD;
great service to you if you, were cured of a&#xD;
weakness which only brought you pain; a&#xD;
greater on~ yet to me, if it gives me back the&#xD;
old affection which we felt for one another&#xD;
when we were children together in our be-&#xD;
loved Louisiana."&#xD;
"I said that I had been fighting against&#xD;
it," answered he, pausing short in his walk.&#xD;
"And I thought I had entirely succeeded in&#xD;
crushing it out, or I would never have come&#xD;
&#xD;
here! But the first sight of your face, the&#xD;
first tone of your voice, told me that one&#xD;
word would be enough to waken it again-.&#xD;
and-and I'm almost afraid that word has&#xD;
been spoken!"&#xD;
"I am not afraid of it," said Valerie,&#xD;
firmly, for she felt that a moment had come&#xD;
when she must put an end to all false hopes&#xD;
for very honor's sake. "You might have&#xD;
clung to me so long as I was heart-free,&#xD;
Oharley, but I know you too well to fear&#xD;
that you will do so when I tell you that, al-&#xD;
though my engagement with Maurice Darcy&#xD;
is broken forever, he is the only man I have&#xD;
ever loved, and the only man I would ever&#xD;
have married ! '~&#xD;
He looked at her wistfully-so wistfully.&#xD;
"And-when you say that he left you?"&#xD;
"Yes, through my own fault, lie left me."&#xD;
After this, they walked silently along for&#xD;
some time. It was bright moonlight now,&#xD;
and their shadow~4~ell sharply and distinctly&#xD;
on the path before them. Almost as sharp-&#xD;
ly and distinctly Hautaine's tones sounded~&#xD;
when he spoke again:&#xD;
"GAo sard, sard! Yet it seems right hard&#xD;
that the prize for which I have striven a life-&#xD;
time should be seized at last by a stranger's&#xD;
hand; but-there is very little courage in&#xD;
groaning over defeat. I should certainly by&#xD;
this know how to practise the resignation&#xD;
which comes of despair. I don't mean to&#xD;
break my heart, either, Valerie-if that is&#xD;
any consolation to you."&#xD;
"It is a great consolation, dear Oharley."&#xD;
"And I did not bring you away to tor-&#xD;
ment you with the old story that has troubled&#xD;
you so often before. I wanted to tell you&#xD;
something-which you ought to know-and&#xD;
-to ask your advice. Will you sit here a&#xD;
little while-or are you afraid of the night&#xD;
air? "&#xD;
"Not the least afraid," she answered, as&#xD;
she sat down on a stone seat that ran around&#xD;
the~fountain to which they had returned.&#xD;
"I am all attention, and all interest, ns long&#xD;
as you want me."&#xD;
He sat down beside her, but he did not&#xD;
speak for a considerable time. When he&#xD;
did, his eyes were fixed, not on her face, but&#xD;
on the water before him.&#xD;
"Valerie, do you remember the day I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE HIDDEN SKELETON.                  185&#xD;
&#xD;
met Maurice Darcy in your grandfather's&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"Yes," she answered, in a low voice.&#xD;
"I remember it very well."&#xD;
"And did he ever tell you the meaning&#xD;
of what you saw and heard that day?"&#xD;
"Never."&#xD;
"He - Gaston, I mean - told me he&#xD;
thought you did not know. Ho wanted me&#xD;
not to tell you; but I, could not-" he gave&#xD;
a gasp as if for breath-" I could not stay&#xD;
hero in the house with you, and with him,&#xD;
and let you think-let you not think, that&#xD;
is-all that I deserve should be thought of&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"Charley," she said, quickly, "I could&#xD;
never think any thing wrong of you.~~&#xD;
"I remember you said that-or some-&#xD;
thing like it-once before. It hurt then-&#xD;
it hurts now-worse than a blow. Good&#xD;
God! Valerie, when you say that, you do&#xD;
not know that I am worse than a murder-&#xD;
er!"&#xD;
"Oharley!"&#xD;
"Yes," he went on excitedly, "a hun-&#xD;
dred times worse! A murderer at least&#xD;
makes short work of his victim, but I hav~&#xD;
condemned mine to a lifetime of torture!&#xD;
Valerie, think if you can-if indeed auy-&#xD;
body besides myself can imagine-think of&#xD;
what I endure, when I look at Gaston Dar-&#xD;
cy's crippled form, when I remember his&#xD;
blasted life, and when I know that it is all&#xD;
my work 1"&#xD;
"Oharley!"&#xD;
"Yes-all my works"&#xD;
Valerie sat aghast. Her wildest conjec-&#xD;
tures had never gone so far-her most ex-&#xD;
treme fears had never pointed to this.&#xD;
This, then, was the wrong which Maurice&#xD;
Darcy could never fo~give-this the crime&#xD;
which he had declared brought its own&#xD;
worst punishment! And, as the cripple's&#xD;
lined face and bent figure rose before her,&#xD;
surprise and horror together seemed to&#xD;
chain her tongue, until she could scarcely&#xD;
have uttered a single ward if her life had de-&#xD;
pended on it; but indeed Hautaine went on&#xD;
rapidly, as if he did not care to wait for&#xD;
Comment:&#xD;
"I sometimes think that even the suffer-&#xD;
ings he has endured have scarcely equalled&#xD;
&#xD;
mine-scarcely exceed the remorse I have&#xD;
endured for years! I have seen that face of&#xD;
his wherever I went-and in every sound&#xD;
I have heard his voice! I have endured al-&#xD;
most a thousand deaths, and borne within&#xD;
my heart a canker which has poisoned for&#xD;
me sometimes even your smile! The war,&#xD;
when it came, was a blessing to me-but&#xD;
the bullets never found their best mark.&#xD;
Other men-men to whom life was all fair&#xD;
and bright-were stricken down beside me;&#xD;
but I-I was spared!"&#xD;
"Oh, Charley, hush!" cried Valerie,&#xD;
finding her voice and a half sob together.&#xD;
"Hush! It is terrible to talk in that way!&#xD;
Yes, you were spared, and I will tell you&#xD;
why-you were spared to feel that there is&#xD;
One above us who does all things well.&#xD;
You were spared to know that there is no&#xD;
human wrong or error to which He does&#xD;
not grant the power of expiation. Oh, be&#xD;
comforted! Look at that poor face of Gas-&#xD;
ton Darcy, and see what a sublime pa-&#xD;
tience suffering has put there; then, do not&#xD;
dare to say this suffering has been ill sent."&#xD;
"I know! I know! But then, it was&#xD;
not God who sent it."&#xD;
"It was God who permitted it."&#xD;
A pause-longer than any which had&#xD;
preceded it-and then Hautaine lifted the&#xD;
head that had sunk uponhis hands, and said&#xD;
hoarsely:&#xD;
"I believe you know that Maurice Dar-&#xD;
cy and I were once friends."~~&#xD;
"Yes."               ,&#xD;
"Frieiids the very best that ever were,&#xD;
I think. We never made any formal pro-&#xD;
testations of the sort to each other, but I&#xD;
am sure I never cared for any other man-&#xD;
scarcely even my own brother-as I did for&#xD;
him. And he liked me just as well. We met&#xD;
in Ital~y, and were together whenever I was&#xD;
there; indeed, in many other places besides,&#xD;
for Maurice was almost as much of a rovei'&#xD;
as my profession made me. In the summer&#xD;
of '60, the Argemone was ordered to the&#xD;
Mediterranean."&#xD;
"I remember it."&#xD;
"Yes-I suppose you do. Well, as soon&#xD;
as possible, I procured leave 'of absence, and&#xD;
took up temporary quarters with Maurice,&#xD;
then painting in Florence. I found with&#xD;

188                          VALERIE&#xD;
him (his father had died very shortly be-&#xD;
fore) a younger brother-this Gaston-&#xD;
then ~. boy of nineteen or twenty. You&#xD;
don't know how plainly I see him yet as he&#xD;
looked at that time. lWot handsome, I sup-&#xD;
pose; but so full of life and generosity that&#xD;
his face was irresistibly attractive. I liked&#xD;
the boy-no one could have helped liking&#xD;
him; and he took a great fancy to me.&#xD;
How strange it seems, to think that that&#xD;
man yonder is lie-I have not learned to&#xD;
realize it yet. Well-he took a fancy to&#xD;
me. Maurice more than once laughingly&#xD;
declared that I was rivaling him in Gas-&#xD;
ton's affection, and that Gaston was ousting&#xD;
him from mine. One day-" he spoke very&#xD;
rapidly now-" Maurice received a letter,&#xD;
summoning him on business to Paris~ and&#xD;
he asked me if I could not remain with Gas-&#xD;
ton until his return, for the boy was rather&#xD;
inclined to dissipation (his only fault), from&#xD;
which the elder brother was trying to wean&#xD;
him by gentle degrees; and he was very un-&#xD;
willing to leave him alone in a foreign city,&#xD;
'exposed to its many temptations and conse-&#xD;
quent dangers. I promised willingly to re-&#xD;
main, and I remember Maurice's smile, as&#xD;
he said, 'Thank you, arnico mio-I thought&#xD;
I could depend on you!' He did depend&#xD;
on me-and for what?"&#xD;
There was a long silence, during which&#xD;
an instinct prevented Valerie from lifting&#xD;
her eyes to the face near her. So she sat&#xD;
with them steadily bent on the four stone&#xD;
triton, that stood in unchanging attitude,&#xD;
while the water danced and sparkled over&#xD;
their upturned heads. And when Hau-'&#xD;
tame resumed, it was in the same quick,&#xD;
nervous tone as that in which he had be-&#xD;
fore spoken:&#xD;
"M~turice want away, and I do not&#xD;
think I shall ever forget the cordial fare-&#xD;
well grasp of his hand, for I never felt&#xD;
another! The last words he said to me&#xD;
were: 'I trust you implicitly~; but, pray, i~e-&#xD;
member to be watchful.' I knew what he&#xD;
meant, and for several days Gaston was&#xD;
scarcely out of my sight. I felt the nature&#xD;
of the trust the more, because I knew that,&#xD;
if I had not been in Florence, he would&#xD;
have taken Gaston with him to Paris; for I&#xD;
had long been aware why he was more&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
than ordinarily anxious about the boy's&#xD;
habits. Iu the mother's family-Gaston's&#xD;
mother's, I mean-there was an hereditary&#xD;
tinge of insanity, and, in every instance&#xD;
where madness occurred, it had been the&#xD;
result of dissipation. Well, two or three&#xD;
days after Maurice left us, I met, very unex-&#xD;
pectedly one day, a squad of two or three&#xD;
officers from the Argemone. Of course,&#xD;
they were delighted to see a comrade, and&#xD;
the rencontre ended in an invitation to a&#xD;
post-opera supper that night-an invitation&#xD;
in which young Darcy was included, and&#xD;
which all the circumstances rendered it im-&#xD;
possible to refuse. I went, in a state of&#xD;
uneasiness, but it was a great relief to me&#xD;
to find that Gaston kept entirely within the&#xD;
bounds of moderation. Indeed, be behaved&#xD;
so very prudently that I began to revolve&#xD;
and consider possible a scheme which only&#xD;
the devil himself could ever have put into&#xD;
my head, and, before the supper ended, I&#xD;
had invited all the party to dine with me&#xD;
on the followix~g evening. I think some-&#xD;
times of that next day with such vain exas-&#xD;
peration as I imagine to be the portion of&#xD;
the lost spirits in hell. A dozen times, be-&#xD;
tween sunrise and sunset, I was on the&#xD;
point of excusing myself on an?,' plea, and&#xD;
withdrawing the invitation-but still the&#xD;
sun went down behind the Arno, and it&#xD;
was not done. A dozen times at least, an&#xD;
instinct warned me of coming ill, and I put&#xD;
the warning from me. I remember that,&#xD;
just as I sat down to table, Maurice's face&#xD;
rose before me, with a look of stern re-&#xD;
proach-but it was too late then! Several&#xD;
additions of artist-friends had been 'nude to&#xD;
the party, which made it quite a large one;&#xD;
and, with all my efforts to preserve order,&#xD;
the wildest conviviality soon set in. I must&#xD;
hurry over this-it almost kills me to think&#xD;
of it, even now. Among all the jests and&#xD;
songs and peals of laughter that made the&#xD;
roof ring, I grew more and more uneasy,&#xD;
for I soon saw that G~iston had thrown off&#xD;
the restraint 'of the evening befQre, and&#xD;
was drinking with the deepest. liemon-&#xD;
strance would have done no good, I knew,&#xD;
for intoxication always made him resent-&#xD;
ful and quarrelsome. My only hope was&#xD;
in breaking up the party soon, but this&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed almost an impossible thing with a&#xD;
set of men who were my own invited&#xD;
guests, and who, furthermore, had just de-&#xD;
dared an intention to make a night of it.&#xD;
What I endured as I sat there, with a smile&#xD;
on my lip, it would be impossible to say;&#xD;
but it was only a foretaste of that which&#xD;
was to come. At last, my worst fears were&#xD;
realized !-a violent quarrel began between&#xD;
Gaston and one of the guests-one of the&#xD;
Argemone officers-in which I strove to in-&#xD;
terfere. The former at once turned on me&#xD;
fiercely, charging me violently with an at-&#xD;
tempt to domineer over him. I remember&#xD;
that I was patient a long while-longer&#xD;
than was thought a virtue by the men&#xD;
around me-but, at last, the blood began to&#xD;
boil in my veins, and the wine I had been&#xD;
drinking to heat my brain. A bitter insult&#xD;
-I have long since forgotten what it was-&#xD;
finally proved too much for me. I flung a&#xD;
glass of wine in his face-and then we&#xD;
closed together. Of what followed I have&#xD;
little or no recollection. For the first and&#xD;
last time in my life, a perfect devil seemed&#xD;
to enter into and take possession of me;&#xD;
and, in my overmastering rage, murder&#xD;
would have been as easy to me as the rais-&#xD;
ing of my hand. I forgot Maurice-I for-&#xD;
got whom I fought-I forgot every thing&#xD;
save the brute instinct of ferocity. I have a&#xD;
faint recollection of struggling like an infu-&#xD;
riated tiger-a recollection, still more faint,&#xD;
of lifting Gaston Darcy's slight form in my&#xD;
arms and hurling him bodily out of the&#xD;
window !-Then a cry of horror burst even&#xD;
from the half-intoxicated men aroimd me-&#xD;
and I came to. myself-and the sickness of&#xD;
an unutterable death rushed over me.&#xD;
"When they took him up, he was still&#xD;
breathing, but the doctors said the spine&#xD;
was fatally injured. You see, however, that&#xD;
he has lived-a cripple!"&#xD;
Silence again-silence so deep and pain-&#xD;
ful that Valerie almost heard her heart beat&#xD;
in her ears, as she sat, chilled in ~rery limb&#xD;
and sickened in ever~ fibre, so that motion&#xD;
would have been almost as impossible as&#xD;
utterance. She did not see Hautaine-she&#xD;
only saw the moonlit gravel at her feet-&#xD;
when he spoke again: -&#xD;
"I was by his brother's bedside when&#xD;
&#xD;
THE HIDDEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
~T SKELETON.                       18~&#xD;
Maurice came back, and I had rather he had&#xD;
cursed me-~-a thousand times rather he had&#xD;
killed me-than said the bitter words that&#xD;
ring in my ears yet. I sat there, and it&#xD;
seemed the voice of God that ordered me&#xD;
forth, that called me what I felt myself to&#xD;
be, the 'betrayer of trust!' I thipk he&#xD;
would have killed me-I hoped that he would&#xD;
-if lie had not felt that life was my worst&#xD;
punishment, and his best revenge. From&#xD;
that day to this, I have endured worse than&#xD;
death-I endured more than that to-day&#xD;
when I saw the man I ruined writhe be-&#xD;
neath the agony which I laid upon him!"&#xD;
The voice sunk now with an intonation&#xD;
which said: "I have done "-and, after one&#xD;
moment's pause, Valerie's clasped hands&#xD;
covered his own, and a cry, so tender and&#xD;
yearning that it might have burst from a&#xD;
mother's lips, sounded on the still night&#xD;
air:&#xD;
"0, Ohariey! My poor-poor boy!"&#xD;
was what it said.&#xD;
He laid his hot brow down upon those&#xD;
cool soft hands, and neither of them spoke&#xD;
for some minutes. At last he said, without&#xD;
raising his face:&#xD;
"Now you know all about it. Tell me&#xD;
if I can dare to do as he wishes-dare to stay&#xD;
here and meet him, like-like any one elsQ."&#xD;
"Why not?" she asked.&#xD;
"Why not? 0 Heavens! You don't&#xD;
know how I have fled from his presence-&#xD;
how I have shunned him as men shun a pes-&#xD;
tilence! I feel as if the same roof c&amp;amp;uld not&#xD;
-should not-shelter us both!"&#xD;
"And I feel-I know-that if you were&#xD;
once thrown with him, alid once saw his&#xD;
marvellous content, his beautiful patience,&#xD;
as we see it who live with him, you, too,&#xD;
would feel that, although your act may have&#xD;
robbed the world of a man, it gave God a&#xD;
saint! You, too, would realize, as he does,&#xD;
that all ends work for good in His hands.-.&#xD;
and you, too, would learn resignation to the&#xD;
inevitable."&#xD;
"Resignation!" he repeated, almost&#xD;
fiercely, "yes, resignation for any thing&#xD;
which was not my own work. But I did&#xD;
this, not God. How should you know what&#xD;
it is to feel this agony of remorse, this knowl-&#xD;
edge-"&#xD;

&#xD;
lie stopped short, for even the moon-&#xD;
light showed him the change which had come&#xD;
over his companion's face. He saw a spasm&#xD;
of pain contract the pale features, and a&#xD;
mournful light shining out of the large eyes&#xD;
raised to his own.&#xD;
"You are mistaken," she said, slowly.&#xD;
"You judge only by the surface, and you do&#xD;
not know that I bear on my life a weight of&#xD;
remorse to which your own is, or ought to&#xD;
be, almost nothing. You ruined Gaston&#xD;
Darey's mere physical life, and you gave&#xD;
him the means by which he will ascend to&#xD;
Heaven; but what would you think if you&#xD;
had killed body and soul both? What would&#xD;
you feel, if you had deliberately led him to&#xD;
some point of despair, and then seen him&#xD;
rush on a death for which he was all un-&#xD;
prepared, and which was as much your&#xD;
work as if you had killed him with your own&#xD;
hand? Answer me-what would you think&#xD;
of that?"&#xD;
Her voice had risen into solemn pathos,&#xD;
as she uttered these words; and all the an-&#xD;
guish of her soul seemed going out toward&#xD;
him, and being laid open before him. In an&#xD;
instant he knew of whom and of what she&#xD;
spoke. He remembered Julian Romney's&#xD;
face and manner on that night which proved&#xD;
so fateful, and then a sudden impulse came&#xD;
over him.&#xD;
"Valerie, dear ~ he said, quickly,&#xD;
"I know what you mean, but believe me&#xD;
you are all~ wrong. It was no thought of&#xD;
you, no act of yours, which sent Julian&#xD;
Romney to his death. Did you know that I&#xD;
was there, at the party where the quarrel&#xD;
occurred. If you would only-~"&#xD;
But she silenced him by a gesture.&#xD;
"Hush, Charley! It is very good of&#xD;
you; but all this has been said to me before,&#xD;
and still it does not lighten my burden. I&#xD;
know all about it-I know how unlike him-&#xD;
self; how morbid, and wretched, and desper-&#xD;
ate he was-all through me. We will not&#xD;
speak of it. I cannot do so yet-I scarcely&#xD;
think I ever shall. I only did so now, that&#xD;
I might convince you that others suffer as&#xD;
much as you; and to bid you take comfort&#xD;
and faith. This is not surely the first time&#xD;
you have seen Mr. Darcy since-you have&#xD;
met him before?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Once. But he sought me out himself&#xD;
then. It was in Paris; and he came to offer&#xD;
his friendship, he was too generous to say his&#xD;
pardon. A few months after that, I met&#xD;
Mauricefor the first time since we parted at&#xD;
his brother's bedside-and you remember he&#xD;
would as soon have touched a viper as my&#xD;
hand!"&#xD;
"Maurice is very hard," said Valerie,&#xD;
mournfully.&#xD;
"But is he not right? Have I-I, with&#xD;
more than his blood upon my head, any&#xD;
right to touch that other band?"&#xD;
"Yes, you have," she said, firmly. "And&#xD;
Maurice is wrong. It will do you good to stay.&#xD;
It will please kim-and surely you would&#xD;
count any sacrifice well made that did that."&#xD;
"Does he indeed wish it?"&#xD;
"Did he not tell you so?"&#xD;
"Yes, but-"&#xD;
"There is no 'but' in the question 1',&#xD;
she interrupted. "You must stay. First,&#xD;
because he requests it. Secondly, because&#xD;
this is your proper home, now that you are&#xD;
wounded and sick. Indeed, you shall re-&#xD;
main until you are well again. We will not&#xD;
give you up! Put these morbid thoughts&#xD;
from you, dear Charley. Recognize God's&#xD;
will over and above all things; and, when&#xD;
we recognize that, we may as well bend to&#xD;
it, you know; for resistance is utterly use-&#xD;
less. Remember how many years of suf-&#xD;
fering have atoned for the act of one hour;&#xD;
and then remember, also, that it is time to&#xD;
cease mourning. I know there must al-&#xD;
ways be a saddened regret, but the bitter-&#xD;
ness of unavailing remorse is bitterly mis-&#xD;
placed. Sinning and suffering! Ah!it is&#xD;
only what we all are doing; but the suffer-&#xD;
ing need not be prolonged eternally, for&#xD;
even God does not do that, save to those&#xD;
who have never given one thought of regret,&#xD;
or made one aspiration for pardon. Promise&#xD;
me that you will stay?"&#xD;
"I did not ask your advice without&#xD;
meaning to take it. I will do whatever&#xD;
you decide."&#xD;
"I have decided, then. You shall not&#xD;
leave us until you must. Now let us go&#xD;
back to the chMeau-I am sure this night&#xD;
air cannot be good for you-and I will&#xD;
make Alix sing something."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE' HERO OF SADOWA.                  189&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE nzuo OF sADowA.&#xD;
Tnnnn was one person at least to when&#xD;
Valerie's decision proved far from agree&#xD;
ble; one member at least of the chtteai&#xD;
party who wished its new inmate at-well&#xD;
at Vienna!&#xD;
On the very first day of his arrival&#xD;
Hautaine developed a marked admire&#xD;
tion for Alix-an admiration which sensi&#xD;
bly increased with every succeeding honi&#xD;
of his stay, and which caused Eugene'~&#xD;
friendly regard and friendly cordiality tc&#xD;
diminish in exact ratio. For, alas! the ir-&#xD;
ruption into Arcadia was come, the golden&#xD;
hour was over, the magic charm was van-&#xD;
ished, and the rough world, where every&#xD;
man takes what he can get, burst in upon&#xD;
the fair idyl which had a little while back&#xD;
seemed flowing so smoothly to a peaceful&#xD;
close. Xow all was changed. Ohan~ed how&#xD;
much, or how little, no one could tell; but&#xD;
even Eugene's bold heart misgave him some-&#xD;
what. He would not have feared ordinary&#xD;
rivalry at all; he had not cared in the least&#xD;
about the effusive admiration those bearded&#xD;
young engineers expressed for La petite )Yiie,&#xD;
as they dubbed Alix, but then-well, this&#xD;
was different. A rival of any sort would&#xD;
have been bad enough, but a rival who&#xD;
threw him-Eugene-completely into the&#xD;
background, ~d took the highest place in&#xD;
everybody's regard, by virtue of his pale&#xD;
face and his wounded arm, and his general&#xD;
halo of heroic circumstance-a rival who&#xD;
sang an excellent baritone, who could tell a&#xD;
false semitone as soon as he heard it, and&#xD;
who had the whole array of musical terms&#xD;
at the end of his tongue, why it was no&#xD;
wonder that Eugene beg Em to think a good&#xD;
many disagreeable things, and sometimes to&#xD;
say them.&#xD;
"I think I shall go back to work," he&#xD;
said, one day, moodily enough, when he&#xD;
and Valerie chanced to be alone together.&#xD;
"I got a letter from Ledoc this morning,&#xD;
and-well, there's no earthly good in stay.&#xD;
ing here. I think I shall go, Valerie."&#xD;
Valerie looked up at him quickly. She&#xD;
had seen for some time how matters were&#xD;
&#xD;
drifting, and it would be hard to say&#xD;
whetl~er her relief at Oharley's desertion, or&#xD;
her sympathy for Eugene's annoyance, had&#xD;
been greatest. But now, as she noticed&#xD;
~ what a dark cloud rested in the usually sun-&#xD;
- ny eyes that were bent on the distant line&#xD;
1 of purple mountains, the latter came over&#xD;
her all at once with a rush.&#xD;
"Did M. Ledoc write for you. Are you&#xD;
obliged to go?" she said. "If not, I am&#xD;
sure I don't see why you should do so."&#xD;
- he mentioned nothing about&#xD;
wanting me," her brother answered. "But&#xD;
there's no good in staying. I might as well&#xD;
go, and be done with it."&#xD;
"No good in staying," repeated Va-&#xD;
lerie, who was a little puzzled, and thought&#xD;
he might perhaps have been rejected. "Yo&#xD;
good !-I don't understand. What do you&#xD;
mean ?."&#xD;
"Just what I say," answered Eugene,&#xD;
shortly. For in truth he did not mean any&#xD;
thing, excepting that he was vexed and out&#xD;
of temper, and wanted somebody to "take&#xD;
it out" on. "You are so well occupied&#xD;
there is no need of me," he went on, after a&#xD;
while. "I think I'm rather in the way&#xD;
than otherwise. I had better take myself&#xD;
off for a time, and perhaps when I come&#xD;
back-"&#xD;
He stopped, partly because he felt a lit-&#xD;
tle ashamed of his pettishness, and partly&#xD;
because Valerie looked so grieved.&#xD;
"I am very sorry," she began. "We&#xD;
never any of us meant to neglect you-I&#xD;
least of all-but we only thought that you&#xD;
were at home, and that you could entertain&#xD;
yourself better than we could entertain you,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"Pshaw! You know I didn't mean&#xD;
you!" interrupted the ungrateful brother.&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't know that I meant any&#xD;
thing, excepting that I am tired to death of&#xD;
Hautaine's braggadocio stories of Sadowa&#xD;
and K~niggritz. How long is he going to&#xD;
stay?"&#xD;
"Until he is thoroughly recovered, I&#xD;
hope," Valerie answered-for, although she&#xD;
felt very sorry for Eugene, she had no in-&#xD;
tention of giving up Charley.&#xD;
"Humph!" Then, after a pause-" Is&#xD;
that arm of his never going t~ get well?"&#xD;
&#xD;

190                          VALERIE&#xD;
"Doctor Fontaine says it is doing ex-&#xD;
cellently; but that he must not use it&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
"The sling is too interesting to be given&#xD;
up soon, I suspect. And then it must be&#xD;
pleasant to have three or four women wait-&#xD;
ing on him and cutting up his food as if he&#xD;
were a great baby."&#xD;
"Eugene!" said Valerie, indignantly,&#xD;
and then she stopped. It was natural, no&#xD;
doubt, that he should be jealous; but still,&#xD;
even jealousy has its due limits, at least in&#xD;
expression. "Eugene, I am astonished at&#xD;
you," she went on; "your ideas of hospi-&#xD;
tality must surely have changed very much,&#xD;
for I am sure you would not have talked&#xD;
this way once. If Alix is the matter-"&#xD;
Alix is not the matter!" said Eugene,&#xD;
who felt the justice of the rebuke so sharp-&#xD;
ly that it made him irritable. "Alix is not&#xD;
the matter at all," he repeated, tossing his&#xD;
cigar as far out of the window as he could&#xD;
send it. "She is at perfect liberty to be-&#xD;
stow as much of her time and attention as&#xD;
she pleases on this-this wounded hero. I&#xD;
beg your pardon for having said any thing&#xD;
about him. He is a puppy, but then I ought&#xD;
to have remembered that he was always a&#xD;
sensitive point with you."&#xD;
* "He is no more a sensitive point with&#xD;
me than any other old friend would be,"&#xD;
Valerie answered, flushing slightly; "but I&#xD;
am very sorry to hear you talk so. It looks&#xD;
as if-as if you were a little envious.&#xD;
Now, Charley speaks for himself-"&#xD;
"He does indeed, to an uncommon de-&#xD;
gree!"&#xD;
"But you-ah, Eugene, I wish you were&#xD;
more generous. Besides, I don't see why&#xD;
you are s~ jealous. As far as I can judge,&#xD;
your chances of success are as good as, or&#xD;
better, than his."&#xD;
"Better I-you think so?" he cried, for-&#xD;
getful of his late denial that Alix had any&#xD;
thing to do with the matter.&#xD;
"Yes, I think so," his ~ister said, smiling.&#xD;
"But what is the good of tormenting your-&#xD;
self in this way? You h~ive surely forgot-&#xD;
ten your old motto, 'Let the best man win.'&#xD;
It is a fair field; and if Chancy wins-"&#xD;
"That he never shall," interrupted Eu-&#xD;
gene, quickly. "Thank you, Valerie. I&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
see what a fool I was, and I suppose I ought&#xD;
be a little ashamed. The lists are open,&#xD;
certainly; and he-but then I'll make a&#xD;
death-fight of it, and you'll see that I will&#xD;
win."&#xD;
"I should be very glad to see it," she&#xD;
said. But still, in her heart, she thought&#xD;
that she had rather Charley won~ -poor&#xD;
Charley, who had had such a hard time with&#xD;
his love for her, and was besides unhappy&#xD;
in a way Eugene never dreamed of.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Charley was certainly very&#xD;
much attracted by the dainty, brown-eyed&#xD;
fairy who had such pretty, artless ways,&#xD;
~and who looked up so confidingly sure of&#xD;
admiration, when she had executed a high&#xD;
trill or a low scale in very finished style.&#xD;
And there was nothing singular in this, for&#xD;
he was one of a large class of men who are&#xD;
incapable of entertaining a passion which&#xD;
has proved hopeless, and who possess a&#xD;
great, and, for them, happy faculty of trans-&#xD;
ferring ~their affections on very short notice.&#xD;
He had been in love with Valerie for years&#xD;
-more deeply in love than he could ever&#xD;
be again with any other woman-and, as&#xD;
long as he entertained the least hope of&#xD;
success, had been entirely loyal and con-&#xD;
stant to that affection. But, when once she&#xD;
made clear the undoubted fact, that he need&#xD;
cherish no expectation of return, he had&#xD;
been able to resign himself to disappoint-&#xD;
ment without the least danger of a broken&#xD;
heart. He spoke simple truth when he told&#xD;
her that he had conquered his love for her,&#xD;
or he would not have sought her presence&#xD;
again-and, although the old fancy may&#xD;
have stirred a little at sight of the old smile&#xD;
and the old glance, yet she administered a&#xD;
very effectual quietus in the garden that&#xD;
night when she made her confession of love&#xD;
rfor another man, Difficulty did not spur&#xD;
him on, as it would have spurred some peo-&#xD;
ple; for he was naturally indolent, and,&#xD;
like too many of his passionate, changeable&#xD;
race, did not fancy trouble. High grapes&#xD;
were always sour to him, and that fruit the&#xD;
best and ripest which was most easily&#xD;
plucked. If Valerie really preferred Man-&#xD;
rice Darcy to himself, why-&#xD;
"There were maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,&#xD;
Who would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE HERO&#xD;
So he sang duets with Alix, which were&#xD;
all horrible discord to Eugene'~ soul; he&#xD;
talked German with her (German, so exe-&#xD;
crably bad, on both sidus, that it would have&#xD;
ao.onized any ear of the fatherland); he re~&#xD;
counted all the musical gossip of Vienna,&#xD;
where musical gossip abounds; he encour-&#xD;
aged her professional aspirations, which&#xD;
Eugene abhorred; he praised her voice&#xD;
until she glowed into grateful rapture; and&#xD;
he finally put the climax on his audacity by&#xD;
offering to become her maestro during the&#xD;
period in which they both remained at the&#xD;
chflteau.&#xD;
"Not that I think I know as much mu-&#xD;
sic as you do," he went on, in explanation;&#xD;
"but I have heard that a poor teacher is&#xD;
better than no teacher at all. Now, I&#xD;
could at least make you practise regularly."&#xD;
"And I am sure I need to be made,"&#xD;
Alix said, laughingly, but with a depre-&#xD;
cating glance at Eugene, who was glower-&#xD;
ing over the familiar proceedings of the new&#xD;
acquaintance, "I promised Herr Volkner&#xD;
that I would do so, but I am afraid-ab,&#xD;
one's good resolutions are worth so little."&#xD;
"Unless there is somebody to help one&#xD;
keep them," Hautaine answered, in his easy&#xD;
way. "And I am afraid you have only&#xD;
been aided to break yours.-Eugene, for in-&#xD;
stance, seems to be absolutely jealous ~f&#xD;
the piano."&#xD;
"Colonel Aylmer thinks it is horrible,"&#xD;
said Alix, with another little glance at Eu-&#xD;
gene-this time one of resentment.&#xD;
"What is it that I think horrible?" 1&#xD;
asked Colonel Aylmer, who was ready for&#xD;
a battle at once.&#xD;
"Music," said the little, would-be canta-&#xD;
trice indignantly. "You know you talk '&#xD;
about it-oh, dreadfully!"&#xD;
"I don't talk about music-I don't care ~&#xD;
any thing about it-I only say that it is no6&#xD;
a fit profession for you."&#xD;
"I should like to know-"&#xD;
But here Charley interfered. "He is a ~&#xD;
heretic, Miss Rivi~re. ~We will leave him p&#xD;
to his heterodoxy. 'If there is one thing in&#xD;
the world he likes better than another, it is o&#xD;
argument; and I make it a point of con- ~&#xD;
science never to gratify him. Will you&#xD;
take your first lesson now?"           b&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SADOWA.                        191&#xD;
After this, instead of mending, matters&#xD;
grew rather more serious. True, they had&#xD;
a short interval of quiet, when Eugene was&#xD;
obliged to go back to his work; but he&#xD;
came again as soon as possible, and was&#xD;
more than ever outraged at the state of in-&#xD;
timacy existing between Alix and Charley.&#xD;
Then it was that the former found herself&#xD;
placed in rather a trying position. Some&#xD;
women, women fond of flirtation and its at-&#xD;
tendant good things, would have liked&#xD;
nothing better than two admirers-two&#xD;
pieces of tinder, rather-to play oft' against&#xD;
each other in this way. But Alix, being of&#xD;
another metal, found nothing whatever at-&#xD;
tractive in the situation, nothing pleasant in&#xD;
the consciousness that there was a strife for&#xD;
her favor going on all the time. Hautaine&#xD;
was too easy in temper, and too perfect in&#xD;
breeding, to allow himself to be betrayed&#xD;
into indiscretions, or tokens of vexation;&#xD;
but Eugene, far more impetuous by nature,&#xD;
also had himself less well in hand; and he&#xD;
not seldom looked both sulky and savage.&#xD;
He would get into " ways" that were posi-&#xD;
tively dreadful, and distinguished himself&#xD;
by being brusque to Hautaine, rude to Alix,&#xD;
and generally disagreeable to everybody&#xD;
else. He did not succeed in making any-&#xD;
body uncomfortable, however, unless it was&#xD;
F~is ladylove. She, poor child, did not at all&#xD;
understand the meanitig of the black looks&#xD;
md sarcastic speeches freely cast in her di-&#xD;
~ection, and strove sedulously to propitiate&#xD;
aim by every means in her power, sai~e the&#xD;
'ight one. As, for example:&#xD;
"You seem very busy of late," Eugene&#xD;
aid, entering the saloon one morning where&#xD;
he chanced to be alone. "What with your&#xD;
needlework, and your music, and your&#xD;
valks, I have hardly been able to obtain a&#xD;
vord for days past."&#xD;
"I did not know you had tried," said&#xD;
~iix, looking up with a snAle that might&#xD;
~ave soothed a bear. "I thought it was I&#xD;
~ho had not obtained a glance for days&#xD;
'ast."&#xD;
"That was because you were too much&#xD;
occupied to notice them," said he, a little&#xD;
~iortly.&#xD;
"I am sure I don't know how I have&#xD;
ecu more occupied than usual."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Don't you? Well, no doubt I am mis-&#xD;
taken. That seems to be my habit of late;&#xD;
but, whether you were or not, I should not&#xD;
have thought of troubling you with my&#xD;
indifferent powers of entertainment. I can't&#xD;
sing like Mario, or play like Liszt; I can't&#xD;
criticism like the Saturda?, .1?evieu', or talk&#xD;
German like-like Bismarek; so, all I can do&#xD;
is, to keep i~iyself in the background."&#xD;
"As for music," said Alix, "I think you&#xD;
might know a little more about that, and be&#xD;
a little more liberal-but, for the others, I&#xD;
am sure you can do them all quite as well as&#xD;
the rest of us. For my part, I am very sorry&#xD;
that such a fit of modesty has seized you;&#xD;
for I liked you better when you didn't keep&#xD;
'in the background."&#xD;
"Humph I" said Eugene-mollified in&#xD;
spite of himself.&#xD;
He amused himself for some time then, by&#xD;
playing with one of her spools; and, after he&#xD;
had tied at least a dozen knots in the thread,&#xD;
and broken each one of them off, he tossed&#xD;
it back into her work-box, and inquired&#xD;
what~he was doing.&#xD;
"Not very much," she answered. "I&#xD;
am only making a sling for the wounded&#xD;
arm of. our hero of Sadowa. See! I have&#xD;
made it out of the Austrian colors in com-&#xD;
pliment to his new nationality. Is it not&#xD;
pretty?"&#xD;
She held it up before him, and Eugene&#xD;
looked at it, and felt that he hated it. The&#xD;
hero of Sadowa! Perhaps, after all, that&#xD;
was the great sting, since he, poor fellow,&#xD;
was not the hero of ally thing. If he cher-&#xD;
isheft a wish in his heart at that moment, it&#xD;
was that he, too, had been at Sadowa (in&#xD;
the Prussian ranks), .and thus possessed one&#xD;
good chance at least tQ have had it out with&#xD;
this detested rival.&#xD;
"I suppose it is pretty," he said at last,&#xD;
somewhat ungraciously; "but I am not fond&#xD;
of either yellow or black. Indeed, I don't&#xD;
know that I'm fond of any colors, excepting&#xD;
the red, white, and red."&#xD;
"Then, when you need a sling," she said&#xD;
laughingly, "I will make it for you out of&#xD;
those beloved colors."&#xD;
"Thank you,~~ he returned, "but, as I am&#xD;
not likely to be the hero of another Sadowa,&#xD;
I shall not prabahly call upon you. My&#xD;
&#xD;
fighl~ing-days are over for good and for&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"Ab, that is your same old philosophy,&#xD;
but-do you think it is necessary?"&#xD;
"I certainly don't think it is worthy of a&#xD;
Confederate officer to descend to the rank&#xD;
of a mere mercenary," he answered, with ill-&#xD;
restrained bitterness.&#xD;
"You surely do not mean it," said Alix,&#xD;
looking at him with eyes full of indignant&#xD;
reproach. "You surely do not mean it,&#xD;
when you remember how many of our best&#xD;
and bravest officers are soldiers in other&#xD;
armies now; and when you remember, too,&#xD;
the great names that Jiave made the profes-&#xD;
sion illustrious.~~&#xD;
"I suppose you see promise of another&#xD;
Duke de Ber~wick in your hero of Sadowa."&#xD;
"I don't know about seeing that," she&#xD;
returned; "but I am sure he could not select&#xD;
a more glorious model."&#xD;
Eugene bit his lip angrily. There were&#xD;
never any Dukes de Berwick in the engi-&#xD;
neer service!&#xD;
"He must be very much gratified by&#xD;
your approbation of his profession," he said.&#xD;
"I don't suppose he cares any thing about&#xD;
it," she answered. "A soldier thinks more&#xD;
of his laurels than of woman's opinion."&#xD;
"His laurels! I did not know that any-&#xD;
body owning allegiance to the double-headed&#xD;
eagle won any laurels at Sadowa."&#xD;
Alix laid down her work and looked at&#xD;
him with a regard which he did not much&#xD;
approve.&#xD;
"Were there no laurels brought away&#xD;
from Appomattox?" she asked, at length.&#xD;
"A Confederate soldier, it seems to me,&#xD;
should be the last person in the world to&#xD;
think that honor always goes with victory,&#xD;
or shame with defeat."&#xD;
Woman as she was, she had the best of&#xD;
it; and her opponent was frank enough to&#xD;
confess as much. After that, he was not&#xD;
again heard to demur when the hero of Sa-&#xD;
dowa laughingly responded to his title. But&#xD;
whether he liked it or not-&#xD;
"God bless us all, that's quite another thing!"&#xD;
"To-morrow is Alix's birthday," said&#xD;
Valerie one evening, a week or two later.&#xD;
"What can we do to celebrate it properly?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"To-morrow Alix's birthday! repeated (&#xD;
the general, who was deep in whist. "In&#xD;
deed! And how old will she be?"&#xD;
"I am getting quite old," said Alix, witl&#xD;
a sigh. "I shall be eighteen."&#xD;
"Dear me! So old as that?" asked Mist&#xD;
Fane. "No wonder your face should b(&#xD;
wrinkled, and your curls becoming gray~&#xD;
flow fast old age comes on, to be sure!"&#xD;
"Now you are laughing at me," said&#xD;
All; good-humoredly. "But, indeed, I dc&#xD;
feel as if it was strange that I should be even&#xD;
so old as that."&#xD;
"We all have that feeling of astonish.&#xD;
ment at every birthday," said Hautaine.&#xD;
"I am sure it was with difficulty I realized&#xD;
not long ago that I am fast approaching&#xD;
that bourne where, according to the prov-&#xD;
erb, a man must be either a fool or a&#xD;
physician.'&#xD;
"And your prudence about you arm en-&#xD;
titles you to hope that you may be included&#xD;
in the latter category," said Mr. Darcy, smil-&#xD;
lug. "Isitnotno?"&#xD;
"He has been very prudent and very&#xD;
obedient," said Valerie, looking at him with&#xD;
a smile; "and I, for one, will grant him the&#xD;
full benefit of a diploma. But you are all&#xD;
forgetting my question-what shall be done&#xD;
to celebrate Alix's birthday."&#xD;
"I can suggest nothing better than a din.&#xD;
ner-party," said the general, who was medi-&#xD;
tating whether or not to play a king second&#xD;
in hand, and thought that the most impor-&#xD;
taut matter of the two.&#xD;
"Dear me, papa," said his daughter,&#xD;
with a faint laugh. "You surely forget&#xD;
that we are not now at Aylmers, with a&#xD;
whole neighborhood at our call. The cure,&#xD;
and Dr. Fontaine are our bnly available&#xD;
guests, you know; and I really ilon't think&#xD;
that either of them would enliven the oc6a-&#xD;
sion very much. No; whatever we decide&#xD;
upon, must of necessity be limited to our-&#xD;
selves."&#xD;
"Shall I tell you what to do?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Darcy, making a rash play, and laying&#xD;
himself open to a trump on his strongest&#xD;
suit. "You have been talking of an excur-&#xD;
sion to the hills for some time. Why not&#xD;
go to-morrow, and celebrate Miss Rivi~re's&#xD;
birthday there."           -&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why not, indeed?" exclaimed Eugene.&#xD;
- "What say you, ladies all?"&#xD;
"I think it is a very happy suggestion,"&#xD;
answered Valerie; "but what does Alix&#xD;
say?"&#xD;
"I shall be delighted," said Alix, looking&#xD;
radiant.&#xD;
"And I shall be resigned," said Miss&#xD;
Fane. "As a general rule, I abhor picnics.&#xD;
I They are indissolubly associated in my mind&#xD;
with earwigs, caterpillars, and bad colds;&#xD;
but it will afford me pleasure to victimize&#xD;
myself to-morrow."&#xD;
"We will go, then," said Hautaine. "Is&#xD;
it settled?-all of us?"&#xD;
"All who can ride," said Mr. Darcy.&#xD;
"Naturally, I am not ov~ of that number."&#xD;
"And are we to leave you behind?" said&#xD;
Valerie, turning quickly to him. "That&#xD;
will never do!"&#xD;
"Why not?" he asked. "My time was&#xD;
always spent alone, until I Imew what such&#xD;
kind friends were. Besides, I have a long&#xD;
letter to write to Maurice, and I shall be&#xD;
fully occupied with it."&#xD;
"After that declaration, Valerie, I fancy&#xD;
you can have nothing more to say," laughed&#xD;
Eugene, as he rose to leav0 the rQOm. "If&#xD;

down to the village find secure Lucien and&#xD;
his mules, or-from the pure perversity of&#xD;
human circumstances-some oz~e else will&#xD;
anticipate us~ This is the season for tour-&#xD;
"I s~e my concern is wasted on your ac-&#xD;
count," said Miss Aylmer, looking at Gaston.&#xD;
"I wonder if there ever was aman whose&#xD;
idea of comfort was not aswociated with the&#xD;
entire absence of every thing feminine?"&#xD;
"And abominably i~ngrateful It is," said&#xD;
Netta, indignantly; "for I should like to&#xD;
know what 4In~ or all of them would do&#xD;
without us."&#xD;
"There are men on record who have&#xD;
tried the experiment," said Hautaine, "and&#xD;
they found that they did so well without&#xD;
you, that the only wonder then became how&#xD;
they ever managed to do toitk you."&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
wno LAUGHED LAST?&#xD;
THE next morning was as bright as could&#xD;
have been desired, even for a picnic excur-&#xD;
sion, and, at a very early hour, the whole&#xD;
'party were gathered on the terrace ready&#xD;
to start. Lucien, the handsome, sunburnt&#xD;
guide, stood below the steps with his four&#xD;
gayly-decorated mules, on one of which&#xD;
Baptiste was busily engaged in packing a&#xD;
hamper, while the group above talked and&#xD;
lingered, and did not seem in any haste to&#xD;
beoff.&#xD;
"Dear me! "said Miss Fane, who was&#xD;
the last person to make her appearance,&#xD;
looking very sleepy and rather injured,&#xD;
"are we going to ride pillion-fashion ?-or&#xD;
are we going to take it turn about walking?&#xD;
-or are three of us going to stay at home?&#xD;
-or what is the meaning of there being so&#xD;
few mules?"&#xD;
"You are each expected to mount a&#xD;
gentleman behind you," said Mr. Darcy,&#xD;
who wSs leaningon his crutches and enjoy-&#xD;
ing the bustle of departure as much as those&#xD;
immediately interested in it. "As, by your&#xD;
own admission, you are the ranking lady in&#xD;
point of age, you will be allowed the first&#xD;
choice of a companion. Shall it be Mr.&#xD;
Hautaine or Colonel Aylmer?"&#xD;
"Neither," she answered, with a shrug&#xD;
of her shoulders. "I don't want to be&#xD;
shoved over the first precipice we reach-&#xD;
General Aylmer, is there anybody else you&#xD;
would particularly like to accompany?"&#xD;
"No one else at all, Miss Netta," said&#xD;
the genei~al, gallantly. "There never iv any-&#xD;
body else when you are present."&#xD;
"Then, pray consider yourself invited to&#xD;
ride behind that extraordinary-looking affair&#xD;
on which I suppose I am to be perched."&#xD;
"Is she really in earnest?" cried Alix,&#xD;
turning to Mr. Darcy, in genuine consterna-&#xD;
tion. "Are we really to have a gentleman&#xD;
behind us? Oh, my dear general, please-&#xD;
please go with me!"&#xD;
"I am very sorry that a previous en-&#xD;
gagement prevents my having that pleas-&#xD;
ure," said the general, laughing. "But I&#xD;
&#xD;
WHlOs LAUC&#xD;
&#xD;
will delegate the duty to my representative.&#xD;
Eugene&#xD;
"No, no!" cried Alix, quickly, "I can-&#xD;
not think of troubling Colonel Aylmer.-&#xD;
Mr. Darcy, do come with us-Mr. Darcy,&#xD;
* pray! Indeed, no harm shall happen to you,&#xD;
* if you will only ride behind me."&#xD;
"Listen to that mighty offer of protec-&#xD;
tion, will you?" saidflautaine, with a laugh.&#xD;
"Miss Alix, you had better take care of me.&#xD;
I am wounded yet, you know."&#xD;
"The linked music of Sadowa long&#xD;
drawn out," said Eugene with an only half.&#xD;
suppressed sneer.-" Miss Alix, I cannot&#xD;
call upon you for protection, but I flatter&#xD;
myself that in any emergency-and these&#xD;
mountain ascents are dangerous, you know&#xD;
-I should be able to render a littler Come,&#xD;
which of us will you accept?"&#xD;
Alix stood.twisting a little riding~.whip&#xD;
rather nervously in her hand; and looking&#xD;
with an embarrassed face from one to the&#xD;
other of her would-be escorts.&#xD;
"I don't accept either, Colonel Aylmer,"&#xD;
she said at last. "I-I wish you would&#xD;
please let me just go along by myself."&#xD;
"That is flattering to you both, at any&#xD;
rate," said Mr. Darcy, laughing.&#xD;
"It would provide me well with attend-&#xD;
ants," said Valerie; "but I don't know that&#xD;
they would be worth much under the cir-&#xD;
cumstances.-Come, Alix, which shall it&#xD;
be?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I'm very much obliged to ydu&#xD;
both," said Alix, still looking at the two&#xD;
gentlemen with a troubled expression;&#xD;
"but-but I think you would either of you&#xD;
be too heavy fur my mule I You ece I have&#xD;
already chosen the smallest."&#xD;
She made this announcement with the&#xD;
most sincere gravity, and was not a little&#xD;
surprised that its only reception was a burst&#xD;
of laughter all round.&#xD;
"You absurd creature!'? said Miss&#xD;
Fane, "do you mean to go through life be-&#xD;
lieving every thing that anybody chooses&#xD;
to tell you? Moderate your fears! We are&#xD;
each to have a cavalier, but he is only to&#xD;
lead our mule."&#xD;
"But-but is not General Aylmer really&#xD;
going to ride behind you?" Alix asked,&#xD;
still rather doubtful.&#xD;
&#xD;
Netta laughed as, by the joint efforts of&#xD;
the general and Lucien, she was safely de-&#xD;
posited in the saddle. "Not unless he com-&#xD;
pletely breaks down with fatigue," she said.&#xD;
"I only hope I may live to get down from&#xD;
this rickety affair," she added, resignedly, as&#xD;
she gathered up her reins and started for-&#xD;
ward with a jingling of many bells.&#xD;
The next couple to set forth were Eugene&#xD;
and Alix, for, to the great delight of the&#xD;
former, the privilege of attendance had de-&#xD;
volved upon himself - Hautaine having&#xD;
gracefully surrendered the point, and of-&#xD;
fered his escort to his hostess. It is to be&#xD;
hoped that duty. was, in this instance, its&#xD;
own reward, and that he did not think of&#xD;
the use to which Eugene might put such an&#xD;
opportunity. But as Alix moved off with&#xD;
her stalwart escort, Oharley certainly set&#xD;
his teeth together for a moment, muttering,&#xD;
too low for any one to hear, the familiar&#xD;
proverb, "He laughs best who laughs last."&#xD;
This jealous paroxysm was only momentary,&#xD;
however; for there was no shadow on his&#xD;
face when he looked up and waved a very&#xD;
spirited farewell to Mr. Darey, as they two&#xD;
moved off.&#xD;
They passed through the vineyards, and,&#xD;
where the regular mountain ascent began,&#xD;
came suddenly upon the general and Miss I&#xD;
Fane, resting comfortably under the shade I&#xD;
of a gigantic chestnut.&#xD;
"We are waiting for Lucien and the I&#xD;
sumpter-mule," the former explained, when&#xD;
they came in sight. "Is he with you ?-Ah,&#xD;
there he comes. .3fons Ii rave, the place of a&#xD;
guide is always in the van." t&#xD;
"Oui, m'sieur," said Lucien, who un- c&#xD;
derstood the gesture, if not the words; f&#xD;
and he led his mule forward immediately. I&#xD;
The tinkling cavalcade fell into line be- l&#xD;
hind him-Eugene and Alix, who had been ti&#xD;
delayed, bringing up the rear, while Miss 'o&#xD;
Fane who came next to the sumpter-mule, s&#xD;
looked back over her shoulder with a bright v&#xD;
smile, as they started.                g&#xD;
"Valerie, what do we~most remind you h&#xD;
of?" she asked, gayly. "Do you remember e:&#xD;
the old woman who had rings on her fin- 54&#xD;
gers and bells on her toes? One would xx&#xD;
really think that all her family connection e&#xD;
were here to-day."                     p&#xD;
&#xD;
rilED LAST?                        195&#xD;
"We move to a concord of sweet sounds,&#xD;
certainly," Valerie answered; "but I rather&#xD;
like it."&#xD;
"Yes, it is not disagreeable-especially&#xD;
if one has not much to say."&#xD;
And, as this was peculiarly the case with&#xD;
Miss Aylmer and her attendant, the pretty&#xD;
music of their bells served in place of con-&#xD;
versation, as they wound up the steep moun-&#xD;
tain-path after their guide-generally tinder&#xD;
large trees which overshadowed their way&#xD;
with dense foliage and cool, dark shade, but,&#xD;
now and then, catching glimpses of the val-&#xD;
ley beneath, and the wide plains beyond, all&#xD;
bathed in the glad golden sunlight of the&#xD;
south. The air was deliciously fresh and&#xD;
pure at that high altitude, fragrant too with&#xD;
the wild, sweet odors of the forest; and so&#xD;
ciear that distant objects seemed incredibly&#xD;
near and distinct. The village and the&#xD;
chAteau lay as it were at their very feet,&#xD;
while here and there they could distinguish&#xD;
all the residences which they knew, some&#xD;
standing out boldly, like old baronial cas-&#xD;
tles, others half hid among empowering&#xD;
trees. Against the far horizon shone a sil-&#xD;
ver line, which Lucien told them was the&#xD;
Loire on its way to the sea; while, towering&#xD;
tbove the lower range they were treading,&#xD;
~he higher mountain-tops sharply cut against&#xD;
~he deep sapphire sky.&#xD;
So, as they jogged forward, Valerie and&#xD;
he man who had once been her lover con-&#xD;
rersed gravely of landscape effects, of tints&#xD;
aid views; while Alix and Eugene became&#xD;
rery oblivious of Nature, and talked of mat-&#xD;
ers decidedly more interesting-at least to&#xD;
~ne of them. All the clouds of the last&#xD;
ew weeks had temporarily dispersed, for&#xD;
4ugene was determined to make good use of&#xD;
iS opportunity, and Alix, who was very&#xD;
auch relieved to find him in a good-humor&#xD;
nce more, enjoyed the change without con-&#xD;
idering how long or how short a time it&#xD;
rould last. Her laugh rang as clear, her&#xD;
lance was as bright, as if the face at her side&#xD;
ad never been more overcast than at pres-&#xD;
at, or as if she was pleased to hold in pos-&#xD;
~ssion once more the moody, wayward ad-&#xD;
iirer, of whom, in truth, she stood consid-&#xD;
rably in awe. There is no better philoso-&#xD;
hy in the world than that of "gathering&#xD;

the roses while you may," and it was one&#xD;
which both of these unconscious philosophers&#xD;
practised very thoroughly that morning.&#xD;
Yet, in thinking it over afterward, Eugene&#xD;
began to regret that he- had spent that&#xD;
precious time in gay trifling-in a sort of&#xD;
veiled sword-play, where each understood&#xD;
the other perfectly-instead of putting his&#xD;
fate boldly to the touch. But Alix was so&#xD;
charming, that he forgot every thing save&#xD;
the mere pleasure of being with her, of let-&#xD;
ting his arm rest over the neck of her mule,&#xD;
and looking up into the brown eyes that&#xD;
were all aglow with the bright enjoyment&#xD;
of eighteen. Afterward he appreciated&#xD;
this folly as it deserved to beappreciated,&#xD;
and rated the consequences perhaps higher&#xD;
than they deserved to be rated, but just then&#xD;
he did nothing save bask in the sunshine&#xD;
and gather the roses, forgetting that dead&#xD;
roses sometimes possess very sharp thorns.&#xD;
Only they began to drift a little toward&#xD;
earnestness, when, in reply to some declara-&#xD;
tion of devotion, Alix shook her head in&#xD;
saucy coquetry, and bade 'him remeinber a&#xD;
a certain Mademoiselle de Morny for whom&#xD;
he had owned an undoubted Cendresse not&#xD;
long before. .&#xD;
"And what then?" asked he, who had&#xD;
no idea of attempting evasion. " You won't&#xD;
deny that the heart can change its alle-&#xD;
giance, I hope?"  -&#xD;
" The heart change its allegiance! .2ak&#xD;
foi, what an assertion!" cried she. "Mr.&#xD;
Hautaine did well to -say you were a heretic&#xD;
by nature. What will you question next,&#xD;
I wonder? Why-&#xD;
* The leaves bloom every year,&#xD;
,But the heart but once; and when&#xD;
The blossoms fan off sear,&#xD;
No new leaves come again.'"&#xD;
"Bah !" said he,.irreverently. " That's&#xD;
all very fine ; and true, perhaps-in poetry !&#xD;
But there's not a living man who could not&#xD;
refute it from experience. -Indeed, the most&#xD;
of us woQuld be sorry enough if we had to&#xD;
abide through life by our first'love."&#xD;
" You don't believe in first loves, then? "&#xD;
"No," said the young heretic, boldly;&#xD;
"for not once in. a thousand cases is a first&#xD;
lov6 any thing but a first folly. A man's last&#xD;
love is his best," he went on-" because into&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
that goes all his strength and passion, if he&#xD;
has any."&#xD;
"But," said she, aghast, "his last love&#xD;
may be his hundredth."&#xD;
"What matter-if it be love, and the&#xD;
rest mere fanciest For I agree with your&#xD;
poet tilus far-we may think we love many&#xD;
times, we really do love but once."&#xD;
" But if we think so every time, how are&#xD;
we to know the right time-the real Simon&#xD;
Pure-when it comes?9" .&#xD;
He looked rather puzzled for a moment&#xD;
-then he glanced up with a meaning smile,.&#xD;
"Shall I tell you ?"&#xD;
" No," she said, with a deep blush;&#xD;
"never mind, just now. Only I think you&#xD;
are wrong about any capacity of love being&#xD;
left for a hundredth fancy. Surely Cupid's&#xD;
quiver is not inexhaustible ; and, after hav-&#xD;
ing squandered affe6tion in small coin, how&#xD;
can you possess it in large bills"&#xD;
"Don't make your questions so person-&#xD;
al," he said, laughingly. " I-individually&#xD;
-cannot lay claim to the distinction of a&#xD;
hundredth or even a fiftieth love." '&#xD;
" Oh, you content yourself with a forty.-&#xD;
ninth." -&#xD;
"Take care!" he rejoined. "I am a&#xD;
patient man, but, after a while, you will&#xD;
provoke something which you may not&#xD;
fancy."&#xD;
"I'm not afraid,"' she said, tossing her&#xD;
head very prettily.&#xD;
"Give me a defiance, then."&#xD;
But this she declined to do. On the&#xD;
contrary, she suddenly stopped talking, and&#xD;
became very much interested in ,the caval-&#xD;
cade ahead,.&#xD;
" They are halting," she said; " I won-&#xD;
der what it means ? Surely we have not&#xD;
reached our destination !-if so, you must&#xD;
have been very entertaining, Colonel Ayl-&#xD;
iper, for the way has seemed very short."&#xD;
"I am inexpressibly charmed to hear&#xD;
it," said Colonel Aylmer; ."for, if I am not&#xD;
mistaken, this is where we strike our tent.&#xD;
.-Eh, Lucien, is it not ?"       ..&#xD;
" This is the place," said Hautaine, com-&#xD;
ing forward. "Miss Alix, are you tired?&#xD;
Let me take you down."&#xD;
Alix held out her hand with a smile, but&#xD;
Eugene peremptorily interfered. "That is&#xD;
&#xD;
*2&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
WHO LAU&#xD;
&#xD;
my right," he said ; and, the next moment,&#xD;
his strong arms swung her lightly to the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
It was a very beautiful place that Lucien&#xD;
had selected for them-a secluded ravine&#xD;
high up among the mountains, where a&#xD;
bubbling stream gushed out of the heart of&#xD;
a rock, and fell into a basin that was placed&#xD;
below it. The light' streamed deliciously&#xD;
soft and dim through the green shade of the&#xD;
overhanging trees, and the whole spot was&#xD;
so lovely that it was no wonder pious hands&#xD;
had dedicated it to the patron saint of the&#xD;
district, and placed a rude cross and image&#xD;
over the stream.&#xD;
"'Drink, weary pilgrim, drink and pray&#xD;
For the kind soul of Sibyl Grey,&#xD;
Who built this cross and well,'"&#xD;
said Valerie, as she stood looking down on&#xD;
the water with which they had all crossed&#xD;
themselves. "I would like to do something&#xD;
of this sort," she added. " I wonder who&#xD;
it was that first dedicated this spring"&#xD;
"It ought to have a statue of St. Hubert&#xD;
instead of St. Clothilde," said Eugene. " I&#xD;
mean to tell M. le Cure so the next time I&#xD;
Ssee him."&#xD;
"It is a great resort with the wood-cut-&#xD;
ters and chestnut-gatherers, and all the&#xD;
other peasants who live in these mountains,&#xD;
Lucien says," answered Miss Pane. "Per-&#xD;
haps you had better make your complaints&#xD;
to them-only I don't expect they would&#xD;
care much about placing their spring under&#xD;
St. Hubert's protection."&#xD;
"I vote that we come here every day to&#xD;
dine," said Hautaine,,seating himself on a&#xD;
large stone, and looking round with an air of&#xD;
great complacency. "It is really exquisite!&#xD;
-Valerie, I hope your sketch-book was not&#xD;
left at home"&#xD;
" Unfortunately, yes," Valerie replied.&#xD;
"I am sorry, for the whole scene is worth&#xD;
sketching, especially Lucien's mules."&#xD;
"I think she admires the mules more&#xD;
than she does us," said Ajix, turning to Eu-&#xD;
gene with a laugh.&#xD;
s"They are more in her line, perhaps,"&#xD;
answered that young gentleman.--"Lucien,&#xD;
suppose you unpack that hamper, and put&#xD;
the wine in the stream to cool-it must&#xD;
have grown warm by this time."&#xD;
&#xD;
OGHED LAST ?                    ,    Ige&#xD;
"Suppose you do it yourself, Mr. Indo-&#xD;
lence?" said Netta. "Lucien cannot leave&#xD;
his mules. I should think you would have&#xD;
learned, by this time, to dispense with so&#xD;
much attendance."&#xD;
"I am afraid that is a lesson he will&#xD;
never learn," said the general, who was&#xD;
also seated on a stone, and looking by no&#xD;
means so comfortable as the rest of the&#xD;
party. "By Jove! It is very hot! Char-&#xD;
ley, my lad, if you propose coming here&#xD;
every day to dine, I hope you will leave me&#xD;
behind at the chAteau. I may be very un-&#xD;
romantic; but it only strikes me in the light&#xD;
of a very hair-brained excursion to drink flat&#xD;
champagne and eat melted butter."&#xD;
"Pray don't slander the contents of our&#xD;
hamper in that way, at least until you try&#xD;
them," said Miss Pan.-" Eugene, do as&#xD;
you are bid about opening it !-' Queen rose&#xD;
of the rose-bud garden of girls,' will you be&#xD;
so obliging as to spread the cloth Oh,&#xD;
dear ! Valerie, just look here-the pickles&#xD;
have run into the preserves! "&#xD;
" Throw them away,"~ said Valerie.&#xD;
" Two items from our bill of fare."&#xD;
"Save the pickles!" cried Eugene.&#xD;
"How can preserves possibly hurt pick-&#xD;
lesi"&#xD;
" On the principle of sweets to the sour,&#xD;
I suppose," said Miss Fane. " Here they&#xD;
are, then. I only hope you will eat them!&#xD;
The butter is in a liquid state.-General&#xD;
Aylmer, that is for your benefit-you will&#xD;
enjoy it, I know. And here is French pas-&#xD;
try and chicken indiscriminately mixed up&#xD;
together-Valerie, who did pack this 'ham-&#xD;
per ?"&#xD;
"Baptiste, I suppose," said Valerie, care-&#xD;
lessly, for she was more occupied in trailing&#xD;
a vine-leaf through the clear waters of the&#xD;
spring, than in the prospects for dinner.&#xD;
"At least, I gave the order to him."&#xD;
"I declare, there is scarcely a thing'&#xD;
here fit to eat," said Miss Pane, petulantly,&#xD;
" The marmalade is peppei-ed, and the ham&#xD;
is full of honey. Yes, do look, General&#xD;
Aylmer, is it not a deplorable sight?"&#xD;
For the general, much concerned at the&#xD;
dreadful bulletins from the hamper, had&#xD;
risen, and come forward to inspect matters&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
&#xD;

198                      VALERIE AYLMER.                                                         WHO LAUGHED LAST?                      199&#xD;
&#xD;
"The scamp!" said he, working himself&#xD;
into quite a state of indignation against tli&#xD;
absent Baptiste. "I am surprised at yoi&#xD;
Valerie-very much surprised that yo&#xD;
should have left such an important matte&#xD;
to a careless' servant.-What is that, Mu&#xD;
Netta?"&#xD;
"What, indeed?" asked she solemnly, a&#xD;
she regarded a crushed mass that had jus&#xD;
been extracted from the depths of the ham&#xD;
per. "I think-I rather think-it wa&#xD;
once a pate' do fois gras!"&#xD;
"The ohef-d'wuvre that Jules promise&#xD;
me, I suppose," said Valerie, laughing.&#xD;
But the general did not see what thor&#xD;
was to laugh at in such a serious matter&#xD;
He looked at the injured pate' very wist&#xD;
fully. "It must have been excellent," h&#xD;
said, in a tone of regret.&#xD;
"Hang it all, who cares for pate'8.t'&#xD;
cried Eugene. "Fairies don't eat them,&#xD;
am sure, and we are fairies for the nonce~&#xD;
We shall have to content ourselves with tin&#xD;
fare of the hermit of the dale-&#xD;
'A scrip with herbs and fruit supplied,&#xD;
And water from the spring.'"&#xD;
"I told you all, it would be infinitely&#xD;
more sensible to stay at home and invite the&#xD;
cure' and Dr. Fontaine to dinner," said the&#xD;
general, addressing the company, with the&#xD;
ruined pate' still in his thoughts.&#xD;
"Perhaps so," said Valerie; "but we are&#xD;
here now, papa, and we must make the best&#xD;
of it. Let us gather up the remnants of&#xD;
the hamper, and see what we can do with&#xD;
them in the way of a dinner."&#xD;
They did so much with them, that it&#xD;
was a very pleasant feast to which they all&#xD;
sat down at last, under the shade of the&#xD;
overhanging mountain-side. True, a grass-&#xD;
hopper occasionally sprung into a glass of&#xD;
wine, and various insects of the creeping&#xD;
order made themselves entirely too familiar&#xD;
with the plates (not to speak of a large&#xD;
frog which perched himself on top of a loaf&#xD;
of bread, and had it pitched after him when&#xD;
he departed). But, then, people expect&#xD;
such little agreeables as these, when they&#xD;
go picnicking; and don't mind them very&#xD;
much, as a rule.&#xD;
"This is simply delightful," said Eugene,~&#xD;
&#xD;
f ~rhO had entirely recovered all his usual&#xD;
0 spirits. "Really, as Charley says, I would&#xD;
i, not mind coming up here every day to dine&#xD;
u -that is, if we had a balloon at command."&#xD;
r "I would ask nothing better than the&#xD;
is mode of locomotion we employed this&#xD;
morning," said Hautaine, indolently.&#xD;
,s "Charley," screamed Miss Fane, "what&#xD;
t is this on my neck? Oh !-ah!-take it off&#xD;
-take it off!"&#xD;
s "It is Eugene's caterpillar," said Char-&#xD;
by, laughing; "one that was on his sleeve&#xD;
I a minute ago. He sent it over to you as a&#xD;
proof of affection."&#xD;
~ she said, shuddering, C~ this is&#xD;
- dreadful! Caterpillars ad libitum, are many&#xD;
- degrees worse than ruined pate's. Let us go&#xD;
home!"&#xD;
"Accept my humble apologies, and an&#xD;
apricot," said Eugene.-" Charley, fill up her&#xD;
glass, and now, pet, be comfortable and quiet.&#xD;
Nobody is going home for hours yet."&#xD;
"No; for this mid-day heat must be&#xD;
very intense," said General Aylimer, "al-&#xD;
though we are so sheltered that we scarcely&#xD;
feel it at all."&#xD;
"There is almost shelter enough here to&#xD;
* protect one against a storm," said Hautaine,&#xD;
looking up at the dense canopy of green&#xD;
over their heads, with the golden sunshine&#xD;
glinting on the leaves, and flickering down&#xD;
through them in patches of amber light.&#xD;
"Moonlight in this spot must be lovely.&#xD;
There is a moon to-night, is there not?&#xD;
Suppose we stay here until it rises 5"&#xD;
"And break our necks going down,"&#xD;
said Eugene. "That would be- What is&#xD;
it, Lucien?"&#xD;
For the guide had come forward and&#xD;
was addressing him.&#xD;
"I said, m~sieur, that perhaps it would&#xD;
be better if we returned," the man replied.&#xD;
"There is a cloud coming up from the&#xD;
southwest that I don't like; and a storm in&#xD;
these mountains is to be feared."&#xD;
Eugene hastily drailled off his glass, and,&#xD;
rising, followed him to an open eminence&#xD;
that commanded a view of the sky. When&#xD;
he returned, it was with quite a grave face.&#xD;
"Looks badly," he said, in answer to&#xD;
their inquiries.-" Charley, you're a sailor,&#xD;
go and see what you think of it."&#xD;
&#xD;
Chancy went-examined the cloud-&#xD;
held a brief conversation with Lucien, and&#xD;
returned, looking more grave than his&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"The very mischief is brewing there,"&#xD;
he said. "But it may give us time to get&#xD;
down to the plains, if we start at once."&#xD;
"I thought you just said there was shel-&#xD;
ter enough here from a storm," said Vale-&#xD;
rie, who felt very comfortable and very&#xD;
indolent.&#xD;
"Not for such a one as is coming up&#xD;
now," he replied. "Ladies all, how soon&#xD;
can you be in the saddle?"&#xD;
"Help us gather together the de'li'ris of&#xD;
all this, and' we will be ready in ten min-&#xD;
utes," said Netta. "Is there really so much&#xD;
need for haste?"&#xD;
"There really is."&#xD;
They were soon ready; but when they&#xD;
came forth from the leafy retreat, and&#xD;
looked at the formidable cloud, a cry of dis-&#xD;
gust and indignation burst from the whole&#xD;
feminine trio.&#xD;
"You call that a cloud!"&#xD;
"It is only an excuse to take us home in&#xD;
this broiling sun!"&#xD;
"Let us go back and stay where we&#xD;
were."&#xD;
"To horse! to horse!" cried Eugene,&#xD;
who saw formidable signs of a mutiny.&#xD;
"Don't you know there may be danger of&#xD;
the worst sort in a cloud no larger than your&#xD;
hand, even when the sun is shining as&#xD;
brightly as now i You might trust us, I&#xD;
think."&#xD;
"We do trust you," said Alix.&#xD;
"Do you?" ho retorted, with a smile;&#xD;
"then your foot in my hand thus-one bold 4&#xD;
spring-there! Now you are seated as se-&#xD;
curely as Di Vernon herself !-Now, Lucien,&#xD;
lead tm-and, in case we reach the plains. I&#xD;
before the storm catches us, I hereby vow a&#xD;
silver cup to St Cbothilde's well."&#xD;
The sun in which they set out was&#xD;
broiling, but they did n~t suffer from it I&#xD;
very long. Soon the dark cloud swept up&#xD;
from the verge of the southern horizon, and&#xD;
began to overcast the sky; then a distt,~nt,&#xD;
menacing growl was heard.&#xD;
"'There is a sound of thunder afar,&#xD;
Storm In the south that darkens the day,"'&#xD;
&#xD;
quoted Valerie,'laughingly. "I wonder if&#xD;
our excursion will end with the adventure&#xD;
of a drenching after all?"&#xD;
Her companion did not answer at once;&#xD;
he was gazing anxiously at the heavy mass&#xD;
moving forward so steadily over head, with&#xD;
the now obscured sunlight gilding its dark&#xD;
edg~s in a manner beautiful to behold.&#xD;
"I only hope a drenching may be the&#xD;
worst thing that befalls us," he said at&#xD;
length. "If the way were only not so rough,&#xD;
that we might move a little faster."&#xD;
For, by this time, fishes of lightning be-&#xD;
gan to play round their path, and terrible&#xD;
bursts of thunder to echo from the clouds&#xD;
above.&#xD;
"Listen!" said Valerie. "Is it not&#xD;
grand? There is nothing I like so much as&#xD;
the prelude to a storm. What a profound&#xD;
hush seems to have seized on all Nature, as&#xD;
if every leaf were listening to the warfare of&#xD;
the sky; and how the sounds above resem-&#xD;
ble the voice of many batteries-only more&#xD;
terrible! When I was a child, I used to&#xD;
think that there was war in heaven, and&#xD;
what we heard was the great archangel&#xD;
hurting his heavenly hosts upon the rebel-&#xD;
lious legions. Listen!"&#xD;
It was grand indeed-but of an awful&#xD;
grandeur! From side to side the sky was&#xD;
curtained, and blackness 'had seized upon&#xD;
the noonday. The play of lightning grew&#xD;
more vivid-and the rumbling crash of the&#xD;
thunder so near, that the very animals&#xD;
~hrnnk and shivered from head to Coot, when&#xD;
it burst upon them. As Valerie said, the&#xD;
2alm of Nature was so intense as to be sob-&#xD;
nun, for every woodland sound was hushed,&#xD;
avery twig hung motionless to its stem.&#xD;
"Oharley," she said, gravely, "I am&#xD;
very much afraid that we shall not reach&#xD;
;he lowlands before the storm bursts."&#xD;
"I am afraid not," said he, still more&#xD;
~ravely.&#xD;
"What shall we do, then ?-this path will&#xD;
)O horribly unsafe."&#xD;
"And the woods no.better. I am sure I&#xD;
lon't..-steady!"&#xD;
A flash that blinded !-a roar that deaf-&#xD;
,ned !-and a perfect hurricane of wind&#xD;
hat tore down the mountain-side, crashihg&#xD;
he forest-trees in its path.&#xD;

<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8073-00000101"/>&#xD;
200                      VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
The next thing Valerie knew, her muh&#xD;
was crouching to the . ground, quivering in&#xD;
every limb, and her own hands were clasped&#xD;
over her eyes, striving to shut out that aw-&#xD;
Liii glare which had seemed to blind and&#xD;
jazzle at once.&#xD;
"This will never do," she heard Charley&#xD;
say; and, in the roar of sound, it ~eemcd as&#xD;
if he was talking a long way ofi instead of&#xD;
at her side. "If we attempt to keep this&#xD;
path, we shall be dashed over the precipices.&#xD;
We must try the woods, though there we&#xD;
may be crushed to death by the falling tim-&#xD;
ber.&#xD;
"There is not much safety from that&#xD;
danger here," gasped Valerie. "Look!"&#xD;
For, at that moment, a large chestnut fell&#xD;
with a crash across the path just in front of&#xD;
them, thus effectually barring further prog-&#xD;
ress.&#xD;
"At all events, we need not wait to be&#xD;
krned," said Hautaine; and, seizing her rein,&#xD;
he turned into the forest.&#xD;
They came full upon the others, who had&#xD;
done likewise, hurrying and rushing for ref-&#xD;
uge, and finding none. The three genlile-&#xD;
men forsook their charges for a moment to&#xD;
hold a hurried consultation; but it did not&#xD;
result in much. "The very first ravine, the&#xD;
first overhanging rock-any thing!" cried&#xD;
Eugene, and then he sprung back to the&#xD;
head of his mule, leading it forward, "over&#xD;
bueh, bank, and scaur," with a reckless dis-&#xD;
regard of every thing save some chance of&#xD;
~safety from the terrible storm. The rain&#xD;
n~w began to fall in torrents; but the wind&#xD;
had not abated in the least, and threatened&#xD;
every moment to sweep them down the&#xD;
mountain~ making it indescribably difficult to&#xD;
retain any foothold whatever. In all its&#xD;
majesty and terror, the storm was abroad&#xD;
in the mountains, and the scene was one&#xD;
which beggared all description. The light-&#xD;
ning seemed to leap from point to point, like&#xD;
darts from the hands of angered angels; the&#xD;
thunder echoed and reechoed among the&#xD;
rocks, until its reverberations, instead of dy-&#xD;
ing away, seemed rather to increase in vol-&#xD;
ume; water-courses unnumbered sprung&#xD;
into existence, and torrents roared and tum-&#xD;
bled where the morning had seen only a&#xD;
quiet brook or a dry bed, while the pouring&#xD;
&#xD;
rain and the howling wind seemed a mere&#xD;
accompaniment to the grander elements of&#xD;
strife that clashed and roared together in&#xD;
one deafening din.&#xD;
At last, however, Eugene described a&#xD;
shelter-a narrow, high ravine-and turned&#xD;
quickly into it. The wind swept through it&#xD;
with terrible force, and water-falls leaped&#xD;
from all its sides; but at least there was&#xD;
comparative safety to be found there. They&#xD;
drew up breathless, under the shelter of the&#xD;
overhanging hill, and then Eugene turned&#xD;
to his companion, with an eager cry of re-&#xD;
lief.&#xD;
"Thank God!" L cried, and then he&#xD;
stopped short-for it was not Alix, but Va-&#xD;
lerie, who threw back the hood of her cloak&#xD;
and looked at him!&#xD;
It would be hard to say which of the two&#xD;
was most thoroughly astonished; for, until&#xD;
that moment, Valerie had thought that her&#xD;
attendant was Hautaine; but she saw at&#xD;
once how the mistake had been made in the&#xD;
darkness and tempest which had suddenly&#xD;
enveloped them.&#xD;
"You!" cried Eugene, finishing his sen-&#xD;
tence very differently from the manner he&#xD;
had intended. "You !-and-you let me do&#xD;
this!"&#xD;
"I did not knew until this moment that&#xD;
you were net Charley," Valerie answered,&#xD;
as eagerly and apologetically as if the fault&#xD;
had indeed been hers. "I am very sorry,&#xD;
but-but he will take good care of Alix."&#xD;
"Good care-" It was fortunate that the&#xD;
blast came upon them quite strongly at that&#xD;
moment, and swept away. the rest of the&#xD;
sentence to regions unknown. "It is enough&#xD;
to drive one mad!" cried the thoroughly&#xD;
exasperated young man. "I must have been&#xD;
crazy, I think !-and what am I to do now?&#xD;
I can't leave yon here, or I would go after&#xD;
her. Confound him! No doubt he knew&#xD;
perfectly well what he was about!"&#xD;
Valerie could not comfort him, for, al-&#xD;
though she was brave enough, she dared not&#xD;
bid him leave her, even if he would have&#xD;
done so; an~ to set forth in search of hi~&#xD;
missing love was the only thing that could&#xD;
have relievedhis impatient jealousy and dis-&#xD;
appointment. So they , stood together si-&#xD;

brother's hut, which is near here some-&#xD;
where."&#xD;
"Your brother's hut?~"&#xD;
"Yes, m'sieur; he is a wood-cutter."&#xD;
"And do you think you can find it?&#xD;
Heavens I what a blast!"&#xD;
"I can try. Neither mademoiselle nor&#xD;
i~supetite.s "-he pointed to the mules-" can&#xD;
stand this much longer."&#xD;
"Lead on, then," said Charley, "and&#xD;
may St. Clothilde only be kind enough to&#xD;
keep us on our feet 1"&#xD;
"Will not mademoiselle mount again?"&#xD;
"lie; I shall carry her."&#xD;
~ And mademoiselle, thus peremptorily&#xD;
made a thing of naught, rejoiced threat in&#xD;
her heart, and hid her face closer than ever&#xD;
from the wild storm into which they boldly&#xD;
ventured forth. Hautaine felt the convul-&#xD;
sive trembling that shook her from head to&#xD;
foot, whenever the deafening bursts fol-&#xD;
lowed a flash that had shown them all their&#xD;
way, only to leave it in obscurity the next&#xD;
moment. It was a fierce battle with the&#xD;
elements which he and Lucien fought, as&#xD;
they struggled along through the wind and&#xD;
rain-more fierce than that which Eugene&#xD;
was fighting at the same time, because their&#xD;
path lay along a much more exposed decliv-&#xD;
ity of the mountain. More than once, they&#xD;
each thought that the end had come for~&#xD;
themselves, as well as for the helpless being&#xD;
under their care. But they were both men&#xD;
of nerve and pluck-they struggled on,&#xD;
with the storm in their teeth, and were at&#xD;
last rewarded by seeing the outline of a&#xD;
woodman's hut dimly showing through the&#xD;
rain. Almost at the same moment that&#xD;
Valerie and Eugene gained their retreat,&#xD;
this other refuge was won. Lucien took up&#xD;
a large stone, and, with onequick blow,&#xD;
broke the lock which fastened the door.&#xD;
Then they sprang within and hurled it shut&#xD;
against the raging storm that followed and&#xD;
beat upon them.&#xD;
There came the breathless pause of I&#xD;
spent exhaustion, followed by congratula-&#xD;
tions, laughter, and the production of a&#xD;
flask that never before had done better ser-&#xD;
vice. Giving no heed to Alix's remon-&#xD;
strances, Hautaine administered a dose to&#xD;
her, then shared the remaining contents be-&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
tween himself and the guide, who was now&#xD;
busy with his mules. By an unusual&#xD;
chance, the hut boasted two compartments,&#xD;
and, anxious to escape from the society of&#xD;
their four-footed companions, at Lucien's&#xD;
recommendation, Hautaine took Alix in0to&#xD;
the inner room. It held, by way of furni-&#xD;
ture, a rough table and one chair. Alix ~&#xD;
sank into the latter, and Charley took a&#xD;
seat on the former. They both felt rather&#xD;
exhausted, and, after a pause, the gentle-&#xD;
man was the first to speak.&#xD;
"I am sure you will be ill."&#xD;
"2No-I hope not."&#xD;
"I am confident of it. But what can I&#xD;
do? The brandy-"&#xD;
"Oh," cried she, "please don't say any&#xD;
thing about more brandy. I could not-in-&#xD;
deed I could not-take another drop."&#xD;
"You took about enough for Queen&#xD;
Mab before. However, it is gone, and that&#xD;
is an end of the matter. I only wish__"&#xD;
"Don't say you wish we had not come,~~&#xD;
she interrupted, eagerly. "I would not&#xD;
have missed to-day for the world. I have&#xD;
enjoyed it so much."&#xD;
"Have you? That will be pleasant for&#xD;
Eugene to hear."&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
"Whatdolmean? Only that it is Eu-&#xD;
gene who has had the happiness of contrib-&#xD;
uting to your birthday enjoyment-not I."&#xD;
He spoke quickly, almost passionately, as&#xD;
a jealous lover is apt to speak; but he felt&#xD;
sorry the next moment when he saw such&#xD;
grieved astonishment creep into Mix's eyes.&#xD;
"You are unkind!" was all she could&#xD;
say; for, in truth, she was wondering&#xD;
whether her ears had played her false, out&#xD;
Lhere on the mountain-side under the rock,&#xD;
or whether the wind could have uttered the&#xD;
tender words that yet rung in her heart&#xD;
Like music.&#xD;
The young man leaned down so as to&#xD;
bring his face o~ir~ level with her own. He&#xD;
bad handsome e s, and knew it well-&#xD;
Mix knew~ too, en she looked up and&#xD;
net them ~ast~on her face with a re-&#xD;
lard which the dullest woman alive could&#xD;
iot have misunderstood.&#xD;
"Was I unkind?" he said. "I never&#xD;
neant to be that, Alix."&#xD;
&#xD;
'U&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
WJILJ LAI&#xD;
The lingering tone in which he spok&#xD;
her name was as unmistakable as the lool&#xD;
had been; and a nervous tremor seized th&#xD;
childlike girl who was on the brink of he&#xD;
fate, and knew it perfectly well. She ha&#xD;
been brave enough, and fenced gallantly~&#xD;
enough, up to this last moment; but nou&#xD;
she broke dowu utterly. There is alway~&#xD;
something very softening, very contagious&#xD;
so to speak, in a declaration, especially&#xD;
when it is made to a very gentle and yield&#xD;
ing heart. Therefore, the odds all alone&#xD;
had been that, of the two rivals, he whc&#xD;
spoke first would win the day. If Eugene&#xD;
had made his proposal in the morning, the&#xD;
result might have been as favorable as he&#xD;
could have desired; but, with characteris-&#xD;
tie carelessness, he let the opportunity slip,&#xD;
while, with equally characteristic impetuos-&#xD;
ity, Hatitaine now seized in both his hands&#xD;
the chance afforded him, and marched for-&#xD;
ward to make the best-or worst-of it.&#xD;
"I made a vow this morning," he went&#xD;
on, "Alix; do you care to hear what it&#xD;
was?"&#xD;
Alix did not look at him now. She re-&#xD;
garded the floor very steadily, and, after a&#xD;
while, said "Yes," rather inaudibly.&#xD;
"I made a vow," pursued thq young&#xD;
free lance, bending down so close that he&#xD;
could see the beating of the slender temple-&#xD;
vein, and mark the quiver of the sweet&#xD;
rose-lip, "a vow that your eighteenth&#xD;
birthday should not pass without being&#xD;
made memorable in your life, by the option&#xD;
of accepting or rejecting a heart that loves&#xD;
you better than I can say. You have not&#xD;
known me very long, Alix, and-and you&#xD;
will have to know some things about me&#xD;
which may shake your faith in me. But&#xD;
still I love you so dearly, that I think I can&#xD;
venture to ask whether the coming year ja&#xD;
to be a very happy or a very miserable one&#xD;
to me. Alix, which is it?"&#xD;
A pause.&#xD;
"Alix, will you not~tell me?"&#xD;
"I-I don't know~" said Alix. Then&#xD;
breaking down, and beginning to cry:&#xD;
"How can you expect me to tell you?"&#xD;
Hautaine paled slightly. "Is your de-&#xD;
cision, then, so hard a one former to hear?"&#xD;
he asked, gravely.&#xD;
&#xD;
uwuSv LA?5L'?                        203&#xD;
a "I-I don't know? Oh! "with a cry,&#xD;
as a peal of thunder shook the slight build-&#xD;
a lug until it quivered. ~ flow can you talk&#xD;
r about such things, when we may be killed&#xD;
I any minute?"&#xD;
"Who cares?" said Charley, impatient-&#xD;
r ly. "I mean at any rate to know my fate&#xD;
before I die. Alix, this is no time for tri-&#xD;
fling. It must be y~s or no, before we&#xD;
part again. Poor child, how you are trem-&#xD;
bling! Is it I who am frightening you&#xD;
so?"&#xD;
":No," she murmured. "It is the-the&#xD;
thunder!"&#xD;
He said, "Poor child!" again, and then,&#xD;
as if she had been a very child, he took her&#xD;
into the protecting clasp of his arms.&#xD;
"Alix, if you don't tell me differently,"&#xD;
he said, in a voice which quivered slightly,&#xD;
"I shall think you like me well enough to&#xD;
take your place here forever. My love, may&#xD;
Think so?"&#xD;
There was a veryboisterous accompani-&#xD;
ment to this idyl going on. Outside, the&#xD;
lightning blazed, the thunder crashed, and&#xD;
the clouds poured; within, the mules kept&#xD;
up a restless stamping, and Lucien sang to&#xD;
himself a wild cAan*em which he had caught&#xD;
once in a military camp. Hautaine heeded&#xD;
none of it-nor did Alix much; for at last&#xD;
she raised her face all wet with tears:&#xD;
"I like you well enough to do any&#xD;
thing," she said, desperately; "but it seems&#xD;
like-like tempting Providence to talk about&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"I am not afraid of it," returned IJau-&#xD;
tame, irreverently. "And now I mean to&#xD;
tell you how long I have been in love with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Just thien, as it chanced, the outer door&#xD;
was burst open, and Eugene, dripping from -&#xD;
his shower-bath, sprung into the hut.&#xD;
"Good Heavens! "he cried, when he saw&#xD;
only Lucien and the mules. "Alix !-Hau-&#xD;
tame !-Where are they?"&#xD;
"Within, m'sieur," said Lucien, pausing&#xD;
in his chant, and waving his hand toward&#xD;
the iuner door, as if he had been chamberlain&#xD;
of a royal palace. "Entrezt They will be&#xD;
charmed to see m'sieur," he added, h ospita-&#xD;
bly.&#xD;
But it may have been a foreboding which&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
204                  .        VALERIE&#xD;
rendered m'sieur himself not quite so certain&#xD;
of that. At least he hesitated a moment be-&#xD;
fore opening the door, and only did so very&#xD;
cautiously then. He might have shivered&#xD;
it, however, for all that the absorbed pair&#xD;
within would have known. They did not&#xD;
even turn their heads, and, after one glance,&#xD;
he closed it again, and came back to Lucien.&#xD;
" They aret so well entertained, it would&#xD;
be a pity to disturb them," he said. " Is&#xD;
there any brandy left in that flasks These&#xD;
mountain-rains of yours are terribly chill-&#xD;
ing! "&#xD;
The last rays of the setting sun were&#xD;
tracking bright lines over the chAteau ter-&#xD;
race, and gilding Mr. Darcy's figure, as he&#xD;
leaned on his crutches and watched with&#xD;
laughing eyes the forlorn return of the par-&#xD;
ty that in the morning had set out so "gayly&#xD;
~bedight."&#xD;
" Go away, and stop insulting us," said&#xD;
Miss Fane, who was the first to alight. " I&#xD;
can tell you, that, if you had gone through&#xD;
all that we have, you might be thankful to&#xD;
look; half a well as we -do."&#xD;
"Allowv me to suggest, Miss Netta, that&#xD;
you have not had the pleasure of seeing&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
yourself in a mirror," said he, laughing.&#xD;
"Your hat-"&#xD;
"Hush! " cried she, lifting up her hands.&#xD;
"I don't want an inventory of my misfor-&#xD;
tunes., As for the hat,.it only serves me&#xD;
right for wearing it on an absurd mountain&#xD;
excursion! General Aylmer and I are of&#xD;
one mind-we abjure picnics from this day&#xD;
forth for evermore! "&#xD;
" Has not N~etta's indignation exhausted&#xD;
itself yeti" Valerie asked, as she mamited&#xD;
the steps with her own remnant of a hat in&#xD;
one hand, and her torn, draggled dress up-&#xD;
held in the other. Mr. IDarcy, you are the&#xD;
last person in the world who ought to make&#xD;
a jest of our calamity, for it is to you we are&#xD;
indebted for it. One member of the party&#xD;
especially," she added, lowering her voice&#xD;
as she reached his side, "has chanced upon&#xD;
a deeper misfortune than a drenched coat&#xD;
to-day." -,&#xD;
He glanced at her interrogatively. She&#xD;
pointed to Hautaine, who was lifting Ahix&#xD;
from her saddle.&#xD;
" Does that face tell you nothing"&#xD;
" Yes," be answered, looking at it with&#xD;
a smile, half amused, half sad. "It says,&#xD;
'Poor Eugene! '&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
-" TiiE put his sickle in among the&#xD;
days," and, with the summer of 1867, came&#xD;
the Great Exhibition of Paris, where, in the&#xD;
train of crowned 'heads, flocked all the&#xD;
world's large class of sight-seers and pleas-&#xD;
ure-seekers. The month of June found Va-&#xD;
lerie and Netta alone at the chateau, for&#xD;
General Aylmer had gone with Eugene to&#xD;
Paris, and Gaston Darcy had been there for&#xD;
some. months under medical care. The&#xD;
health of the latter was breaking so fast, and&#xD;
his debility and suffering increasing so rap-&#xD;
idly, that before he left them Valerie often&#xD;
felt inclined to urge that lhe should write to&#xD;
Maurice bidding him return if he wished to&#xD;
see his brother again in life. But her cour-&#xD;
-age never bore her out in doing this. She&#xD;
would begin often, but break down always.&#xD;
"You have never told Maurice how weak&#xD;
you are," she said one day, when she had&#xD;
been assisting Gaston to his chair, and&#xD;
watching one of his fierce, frequent parox-&#xD;
ysms of pain. -&#xD;
He looked up with a smile-faint, sad,&#xD;
yet beautiful. .&#xD;
"No-on the contrary, I always write&#xD;
to him cheerfully. I have been a clog on&#xD;
Maurice's life too long already. I must&#xD;
spare him now as much as I can."&#xD;
" But- is this right,?-is it even kind ?"&#xD;
she urged. "Put the case to yourself.&#xD;
Would you thank Maurice for a concealment&#xD;
that kept you from his Bide when-"&#xD;
&#xD;
V I,&#xD;
&#xD;
Sencpaused, and he quietly finished her&#xD;
"When he may not have much longer to&#xD;
be here ? I don't know. But I think-I&#xD;
hope I am acting rightly. God only knows&#xD;
what I would give to see him again."&#xD;
The voice sunk, the blue eyes gazed&#xD;
wistfully and mournfully out of the window&#xD;
that opened to the south-that far south&#xD;
where Maurice was fighting and struggling&#xD;
to save a nation from anarchy and a people&#xD;
from ruin-and there was a choking in Va-&#xD;
lerie's throat which forbade speech, even if&#xD;
she could have further combated this reso-&#xD;
lution, the root of which lay in that grand&#xD;
element of unselfishness which, of all men,&#xD;
-this man most fully possessed.&#xD;
SHe had gone away from them in April;&#xD;
and as the two ladies sat on the terrace one&#xD;
day in the drowsy afternoon heat, and sewed,&#xD;
for lack of something better to do, Valerie&#xD;
said, half-absently-&#xD;
" This is the last of June."&#xD;
"Is it ?" said Netta. "Time flies so&#xD;
quickly when one is monotonously occu-&#xD;
pied-! I don't envy the people in Paris&#xD;
their enjoyment of this weather."&#xD;
"It is time, however, that papa came&#xD;
back for you," said Valerie. "I must write&#xD;
to him, for I will not hear of your missing&#xD;
the best part of the exposition through your&#xD;
kindness in staying with me."&#xD;
"Don't trouble yourself, dear," returned&#xD;
her friend. "I really care so little -about&#xD;
the matter that, save from a feeling -that it&#xD;
would be a shame to live so near Paris and&#xD;
not see the famous exposition, I should not&#xD;

stir a foot. I am growing as indolent as you&#xD;
are."&#xD;
"It is not indolence with me, it is indif-&#xD;
ference."&#xD;
"And are you really determined to see&#xD;
nothing whatever of this epitome of the&#xD;
world's industry and beauty?."&#xD;
"Why should I, when I feel fatigued only&#xD;
at the, thought of it? I care nothing for&#xD;
inventions-I care still less for kings, queens,&#xD;
and satraps! I never read the grand ac-&#xD;
counts with which the papers teem, that I&#xD;
don't think how tired every body-especially&#xD;
the poor empress-must be."&#xD;
"Valerie, you ought to struggle against&#xD;
this frame of mind. You are growing en-&#xD;
nuye'e and weary of every thing."&#xD;
"I believe I am," said Valerie, dreamily.&#xD;
Then the conversation dropped, and they&#xD;
sewed on, with no sound about them, save&#xD;
the notes of birds, and the low summer hum&#xD;
of insect-life. This profound stillness had&#xD;
reigned some time when Miss Fane looked&#xD;
up at last, and found that the work had&#xD;
fallen from Valerie's hands, that her head&#xD;
was thrown against the high back of her&#xD;
chair, so that the sunlight played lovingly&#xD;
over the arch of the white throat, and her&#xD;
eyes were closed while the brows above&#xD;
were knit into a painful contraction ccrn-&#xD;
~      mon to them of late. 1~Tetta's own needle&#xD;
paused in its swift stitches, and she gazed&#xD;
so long and so anxiously on the face before&#xD;
hei', that, if its possessor had not been&#xD;
wrapped in deep thought, the scrutiny must&#xD;
have made itself felt.&#xD;
"Valerie!" she said at last, so abruptly&#xD;
that Miss Aylmer started and opened her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"I'~etta, how you startled me!"&#xD;
"Where were you? You seemed in so&#xD;
much pain, I thought you might like to be&#xD;
recalled."&#xD;
"Did I?" A deep shadow of the same&#xD;
expression fell again. "I was only where I&#xD;
often am-"&#xD;
"In Mexico?"&#xD;
"Yes-in Mexico."&#xD;
"I wish you would keep away from&#xD;
there," said Miss Fane, impatiently. "It&#xD;
does you no good to be picturing all sorts&#xD;
of dreadful things to yourself; and your be-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing miserable cannot affect the course of&#xD;
events one way or another."&#xD;
"I know that as well as you do; but&#xD;
when we suffer, we are not philosophers)'&#xD;
"What are you afraid of?"&#xD;
"Every thing-the very worst. You see&#xD;
how darkly the papers this morning speak."&#xD;
"I see that they seem to think the fall&#xD;
of Queretaro certain."&#xD;
"The betrayal, you mean."&#xD;
"And then-?"&#xD;
"And then-God only knows!"&#xD;
They sat silent for a while longer. Then&#xD;
Valerie took up a hat which lay on the grass&#xD;
by her chair, and began to'tie it on.&#xD;
"Where are you going?" asked Miss&#xD;
Fane. "You have become so restless of late."&#xD;
"I know I have-but I cannot help it.&#xD;
Sometimes - to-day especially - this fear&#xD;
seems weighing me down, and I cannot be&#xD;
still. Would you mind if I left you alone&#xD;
for a short time?"&#xD;
"Where are you going?"&#xD;
"To the village."&#xD;
"May I not go with you?"&#xD;
"I don't mean to be ungracious, but I&#xD;
had rather be alone."&#xD;
Miss Fane sighed, as she sat still and&#xD;
watched the white-robed figure walk slowly&#xD;
away under the green shade. Vigils of pain&#xD;
and anxiety were written on the form almost&#xD;
as plainly as on the face, for the old voluptuous&#xD;
contour was gone, and in its stead there was&#xD;
only a wasted attenuation. Ko wonder. As&#xD;
Valerie herself had once said, it was sterner&#xD;
trouble than the mere aching of disappointed&#xD;
love that weighedd upon her. It was the&#xD;
awful burden of remorse; and lately it was&#xD;
the horrible, sickening fear-daily looming&#xD;
closer-that this remorse might soon be&#xD;
doubled.&#xD;
She had not wished 11'Tetta with her, be-&#xD;
cause she was going to the church, and she&#xD;
wanted to feel herself alone there. For once,&#xD;
it was all empty and deserted, for once no&#xD;
other footstep besides her own echoed on the&#xD;
paved aisles, no other form knelt in the&#xD;
abandonment of human misery before that&#xD;
altar where dwells our hidden Lord, and&#xD;
where the marble angels who guarded the&#xD;
tabernacle seemed bending forward to hear&#xD;
her prayer. Never was one more fervent&#xD;
&#xD;
breathed; never did a poor struggling soul&#xD;
cry with more yearning pathos, "Jesus, Son&#xD;
of Mary, have mercy on me!" She asked&#xD;
nothing for herself-not one healing drop&#xD;
for her own sore heart-she only prayed, as&#xD;
we prayfor life, that protection might begiven&#xD;
the man whom her fault had placed in peril,&#xD;
that he might be delivered from the dan~,s~&#xD;
that encompassed him, and that over his&#xD;
head might sleep the safety, on his life might&#xD;
rest the happiness, which, for a time, she had&#xD;
driven from both. l'Teither did she forget to&#xD;
utter one fervent petition for the gallant&#xD;
heart which even then rested so still, for the&#xD;
royal head which even then lay so low, amid&#xD;
the "plumy palms" of the South.&#xD;
She only knew how long she had been in&#xD;
the church by the level rays of the setting&#xD;
sun when she came out. She paused a me-&#xD;
xaent in the door to glance at her watch,&#xD;
startled to see how late it was; and as she&#xD;
did so a dark figure moved from the shadow&#xD;
of the archway toward her, The sound&#xD;
which accompanied this movement made&#xD;
her start, and turning quickly-for the sec-&#xD;
ond time on that spot-she faced Gaston&#xD;
Darcy.&#xD;
They met almost as brother and sister&#xD;
might have done, and then-while with a&#xD;
sharp pang she traced the fearful strides&#xD;
that, since she saw him last, suffering had&#xD;
made-he said:&#xD;
"I have been waiting for you some&#xD;
time. The fruit-vendor yonder told me&#xD;
you were in the church."&#xD;
"When did you reach the village?"&#xD;
"About an hour ago. You see I meant&#xD;
to take you by surprise)'&#xD;
"And did not papa or Eugene come&#xD;
with you?"&#xD;
":No. I left word for them that I was&#xD;
gone, but I did not see thembefore I started."&#xD;
"Then you should have written to leL&#xD;
us know that you we~'e coming, so that we&#xD;
could have met you here. Of course, how-&#xD;
ever, Watkins is with you."&#xD;
"Yes, but I sent him ~n to the chateau. I&#xD;
mean to walk home with you."&#xD;
"Do you feel strong enough to walk?"&#xD;
she asked, anxiously.&#xD;
"I think so. Why do you ask?"&#xD;
"You look much worse, dear Gaston."&#xD;
&#xD;
It was not the first time she had&#xD;
called him by his name, but he had not&#xD;
heard it from her lips in a long while, and&#xD;
his wan cheek flushed with pleasure at the&#xD;
sound. lie held out his hand, and clasped&#xD;
hers warmly, as Maurice's brother surely&#xD;
had a right to do.&#xD;
"Thank you," he said, softly. "Yes, I&#xD;
am worse, but strong enough yet, I hope,&#xD;
for what lies before me. Valerie-" his&#xD;
voice sank-" have you heard the news?"&#xD;
All things seemed to grow black before&#xD;
her-the golden sunshine, the green lindens,&#xD;
the gay booths, were all blotted out in a&#xD;
moment. She leaned back against the&#xD;
carved door-post, sick and sbudderi~g-&#xD;
longing, yet fearful, to hear more.&#xD;
Gaston Darcy pointed solemnly into 'The&#xD;
dim church.&#xD;
"You were praying when I came. Say&#xD;
another prayer for the soul of the Emperor&#xD;
Maximilian."&#xD;
There was one moment's selfish relief!-&#xD;
then the awful shook that thrilled a world&#xD;
came home to her 1-She looked at him&#xD;
with horror-stricken eyes.&#xD;
"For his soul!"&#xD;
"For his murderers, if you can. lie is&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
She gazed for one moment longer in&#xD;
awe-struck astonishment, then she turned&#xD;
away, and he saw her traverse the aisle, and&#xD;
sink again before the altar. She had prayed&#xD;
for him minute before, as living-she prayed&#xD;
for him now, as dead. And, God forgive her,&#xD;
that she could not pray for those upon whose&#xD;
heads rested his blood-for the mongrel&#xD;
bloodhounds, and the crowned adventurer&#xD;
who shared that guilt between them. The&#xD;
kingly soul that had suffered, and struggled,&#xD;
and gone, neededlittle intercession, little save&#xD;
thankfulness of release; but for her whose&#xD;
name had been last on his dying lips-for the&#xD;
woman who loved him as even women rarely&#xD;
love-for the gentlest nature and truest&#xD;
heart among all the victims that crime and&#xD;
wrong have slain through others-what had&#xD;
not a woman's heart to ask, for her, of faith&#xD;
and strength-strength to await that meet~&#xD;
ing from which parting shall be no more!&#xD;

20S                          VALERIE&#xD;
When th~y were walking slowly home&#xD;
together, Valerie asked Mr. Darcy what he&#xD;
thought of the chances for his brother.&#xD;
"Don't be afraid to tell me," she said,&#xD;
sadly, as he seemed to hesitate. "The worst&#xD;
has been with me for many a day."&#xD;
"I scarcely know what to fear, or what&#xD;
to think," he replied. "I have not heard&#xD;
from Maurice for so long that I know&#xD;
nothing of his whereabouts - only this&#xD;
thing I do know, that there will be a whole-&#xD;
sale slaughter of all the imperialists whom&#xD;
those-those men can touch."&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And Maurice has been too much noted&#xD;
by the emperor's favor to escape their ven-&#xD;
geance, if he does not leave the country at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
She answered nothing. The gray shades&#xD;
of evening were beginning, to close around&#xD;
them, and, as they crossed the bridge, they&#xD;
caught the gleam of a light from the saloon&#xD;
window, which looked so bright and home-&#xD;
liie that at any other time it would have&#xD;
cheered them. But now their hearts were&#xD;
too heavy for cheer-too heavy for any&#xD;
thought but that which was weighing them&#xD;
down. At last, when they were in the mid-&#xD;
dle of the bridge, Valerie stopped, with a&#xD;
sort of gasp.&#xD;
"I cannot stand this any longer," she&#xD;
said, hastily. "I have borne it until the&#xD;
burden has grown too much for my strength.&#xD;
Gaston, you know what Maurice is to me-&#xD;
tell me what you mean to do."&#xD;
~Ee told her in a few words.&#xD;
"I mean to wait long enough to hear&#xD;
from him, and, if I do not hear, I mean to&#xD;
go and look for him."&#xD;
"You!"&#xD;
"Yes, I. Cripple as I am, if he be alive&#xD;
I will find him."&#xD;
lie lifted his wasted form as he said&#xD;
this-light came to his eyes, color to his&#xD;
pallid cheek, and for one moment he looked&#xD;
the man that Nature made him. And, as&#xD;
she gazed, a flash of resolve came into&#xD;
Valerie's heart.&#xD;
"You are right," she said, holding out&#xD;
her bands. "It will be strange, indeed, if&#xD;
you and I together cannot do this."&#xD;
He looked at her in surprised incredulity.&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You and I!"&#xD;
"Yes, if you will take me with you."&#xD;
"Valerie, my child, you do not under-&#xD;
stand-"&#xD;
"I understand every thing," she said,&#xD;
impetuously. "I understand that I, of all&#xD;
people, should seek for him, since I sent him&#xD;
there to suffer-it may be to die. I under~&#xD;
stand that I will never allow yo o go alone&#xD;
on such an expedition."&#xD;
"I will have Watkins."&#xD;
"Watkins is a very faithful servant; but&#xD;
he is only a servant. Hush! I will go! It&#xD;
is all my fault-every thing-and I must&#xD;
bear my share of the consequences. It is&#xD;
my fault that Maurice is away from you,&#xD;
and that you need to attempt any thing for&#xD;
which you are so unfit as for this voyage-&#xD;
therefore, I shall take Maurice's place by&#xD;
your side."&#xD;
The glow of sunset-what was left of it&#xD;
-fell on the resolute young face, with its&#xD;
firm mouth and glowing eyes; and Gaston&#xD;
Darcy saw at once that, unlike the most of&#xD;
her sex, she meant every word that she&#xD;
uttered. After a long pause, he said:&#xD;
"But who will go with you?"&#xD;
"Papa, of course."&#xD;
Mr. Darcy retreated a step, in his aston-&#xD;
ishment-astonishment as much at the tone&#xD;
as at the announcement.&#xD;
"You surely dQ not think that General&#xD;
Aylmer will ever consent to such a plan?"&#xD;
"Leave papa to me. I will answer for&#xD;
him. Gaston-" she came a step nearer, and&#xD;
laid her hand on his arm, while her eyes&#xD;
looked in his face, full of a pathos which it&#xD;
was hard for him to resist-" dear Gaston,&#xD;
don't try to dissuade me! I am sure I shall&#xD;
die, if I am obliged to stay here in this horri-&#xD;
ble inaction, and eat out my very heart with&#xD;
fear. Gaston, there can be no harm in it!-&#xD;
I am his cousin, remeinber!-and, although&#xD;
I am not worthy to say so, I loved him very&#xD;
much!"&#xD;
Ah, the proud head bent itself at last!&#xD;
What would Valerie have thought if this&#xD;
confession, and its attending circumstances,&#xD;
had been foretold to her twelve months be-&#xD;
fore? She the forsaken! This man, his&#xD;
brother! But at last, after weary struggle,&#xD;
there had come to her the best knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BIGHT OF REPARATION.              209&#xD;
&#xD;
that can come to woman-the knowledge&#xD;
that&#xD;
"her dignity&#xD;
Is this-to cast her virgin pride away1&#xD;
And find her strength in weakness."&#xD;
Maurice's brother bent his head, and laid&#xD;
his lips on that soft hand-then he said,&#xD;
gently:&#xD;
£~ As far as it rests for me to say so-do&#xD;
as you will. But I cannot help thinking&#xD;
that your father will never consent."&#xD;
"I think he will."&#xD;
She let the words fall very slowly; and&#xD;
then stood with her hands loosely clasped&#xD;
before her, gazing down at the water which&#xD;
flowed so swiftly and darkly beneath their&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
"It looks quiet," she said, wistfully;&#xD;
"and of late I have so envied all things&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right, after all," said&#xD;
her companion~ looking at the thin, pale&#xD;
outlines of her face. "Perhaps your reso-&#xD;
lution may be for the best. Change of scene&#xD;
may do you good, and-"&#xD;
lie did not finish his sentence. He only&#xD;
stood quietly; gazing Jike herself down on&#xD;
the flowing stream which was hastening&#xD;
along to the boundless ocean, as we all hast-&#xD;
en forward to the joy or sorrow of the un-&#xD;
known future, until at last Valerie turned.&#xD;
"I should not have kept you here so&#xD;
long," she said, wearily. "I forget every&#xD;
thing, it seems. Let us go home."&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THE BIGHT OF ISEPABATIoN.&#xD;
A MONTH passed by, a month of waiting&#xD;
which sickened the very soul. At last, in&#xD;
the full rich loveliaess of summer's prime,~&#xD;
the last day of July came-and no news of&#xD;
Maurice had yet been heard. Two of his&#xD;
comrades had written to Gaston-one from&#xD;
New Orleans, the other l'rom Havana-but&#xD;
only to say that they could give no tidings&#xD;
of him. He had left Queretaro, a few days&#xD;
before its fall, on a secret mission to the&#xD;
mountains; and they could only hope that&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
he was still there, with those of the native&#xD;
chiefs who proposed to inaugurate a guer-&#xD;
rilla warfare against the Liberals; but they&#xD;
did not attempt to conceal their fear that*&#xD;
he too had been included in the massacre&#xD;
of all that was good and true in the un-&#xD;
happy country which lay prostrate under&#xD;
the sword.&#xD;
The last of these letters came on the&#xD;
30th of July. The next morning, Valerie&#xD;
electrified her father by an announcement&#xD;
of her desire to accompany Gaston to Amer-&#xD;
ica.&#xD;
"God bless my soul I" the general ex-&#xD;
claimed in sheer astonishment, and that&#xD;
was all he uttered for some time.&#xD;
"Well, papa?" said Valerie at last, hav-&#xD;
ing waited vainly for further comment.&#xD;
"Well, my dear,". replied her father,&#xD;
only to say that, if you wished to&#xD;
confound me with surprise, you could not&#xD;
have done so more completely."&#xD;
"I did not wish to do that, sir, I assure&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"I expected more from your common-&#xD;
sense," said the general, impatiently. "Mr.&#xD;
Darcy is no doubt a pleasant gentleman, arid&#xD;
a good friend, and all that sort of thing-l&#xD;
am sure I like him very much-but to wish&#xD;
to take an ocean-voyage solely on his ac-&#xD;
count is foolish, my dear, very foolish!"&#xD;
* "Papa, you don't understand: I want tc~&#xD;
try and aid him in looking for his brother."&#xD;
"Worse yet," said her father, gravely.&#xD;
"Surely, my dear, you have grown singular~&#xD;
ly forgetful of all the world would say of&#xD;
you, if you set out on such a Quixotic under-&#xD;
taking!"&#xD;
"The world need know nothing about it."&#xD;
The general shook his head.&#xD;
"The world would know all about it,&#xD;
and I wonder where your own self-respect&#xD;
has gone?"&#xD;
"Papa "-the girl's voice had fairly a&#xD;
wail in it-" don't you see-can't you un-&#xD;
derstand-I must go! You tell me I look&#xD;
badly, and you are right-I shall die if I stay&#xD;
here! Regard the matter only as other&#xD;
people will regard it-as a voyage for change~&#xD;
of air and scene. We need not say to any-&#xD;
body why we go; and you may trust me&#xD;
not to do any thing to forfeit my own self-&#xD;

respect, or lower your dignity. If I meet&#xD;
Maurice Darcy, it will be as a mere stranger.&#xD;
But, indeed, I cannot let Gaston go alone,&#xD;
and remember that we, too, are his near&#xD;
relatives. Surely it is right for us to make&#xD;
those efforts which he, being a cripple, can-&#xD;
not make. Papa, be kind-bc generous-&#xD;
let us go!"&#xD;
General Aylmer looked irresolute. Be-&#xD;
ing, in some sort, a cosmopolitan, one place&#xD;
was very much the same as another to him;&#xD;
and, intrinsically, Cuba would have been&#xD;
quite as agreeable-perhaps a little more so&#xD;
-than France. But, still, he felt strangely&#xD;
averse to this idea. He disliked Maurice&#xD;
Darcy extremely, and none the less because&#xD;
the prejudicewas an entirely irrational one.&#xD;
He disliked him because he stood as the rep-&#xD;
resentative of much annoyance and anxiety,&#xD;
and because he had been placed in an antag-&#xD;
onistic position to Valerie's claim on her&#xD;
grandfather's fortune; nevertheless, he had&#xD;
this dislike sufficiently under control to be&#xD;
willing to accept him as a son-in-law if he&#xD;
came crowned with the halo of M. Vac-&#xD;
quant's half-million. But to go in search of&#xD;
him-really, that was too much! He had&#xD;
no desire to be instrumental in reclaiming&#xD;
him from the hands of Juarez and Co.!&#xD;
Never, in the most secret recess of his&#xD;
heart, had the general done such a thing as&#xD;
to wish, or even to hope, that Darcy might&#xD;
share the fate of so many gallant murdered&#xD;
men; but he could not help thinking that&#xD;
the Liberal leaders would commit a great&#xD;
lAunder if they allowed h~m to slip through&#xD;
their fingers, and go scot-free!&#xD;
"1 don't see how I can possibly consent&#xD;
to such a thing," he said at last, irritably.&#xD;
"And here is your friend Miss Fane; pray&#xD;
what do you mean to do with her?"&#xD;
"Netta's aunt, Mrs Vaughn, is in Paris,&#xD;
you know. She has been meaning to go to&#xD;
see her for some time, and she would stay&#xD;
with her until we returned."&#xD;
"Humph! You have settled it all, I&#xD;
sde. But it is too unreasonable, Valerie I&#xD;
I cannot-positively I cannot consent to&#xD;
such a thing!"&#xD;
"Papa, would you not have taken me to&#xD;
Cuba if I had told you that my health made&#xD;
it necessary for me to go?"&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes-of course."&#xD;
She raised her hand and drew back the&#xD;
curtain of the window beside which she was&#xD;
sitting.&#xD;
"Look at me, then, and see if you do&#xD;
not think I stand in need of change."&#xD;
The general looked, and felt rather un-&#xD;
comfortable as he looked. The pallid skin,&#xD;
the hollow cheek, the eyes with dark circles&#xD;
under them, told a story which it was im-&#xD;
possible for him to disregard. He moved a&#xD;
little uneasily.&#xD;
"You do look wretchedly. I have huen&#xD;
telling you so for some time. I will take&#xD;
you to Madeira."&#xD;
She shook her head with a faint smile.&#xD;
"The physicians say, you know, that a&#xD;
patient must sometimes prescribe his own&#xD;
remedy. You must suffer me to prescribe&#xD;
mine. Nothing but the West Indies will do&#xD;
me good."&#xD;
"By Jove, Valerie, this is very provok-&#xD;
ing, and very irrational!" said the general,&#xD;
getting up and walking im~ipatiently to and&#xD;
fro. "I am surprised at you-a woman of&#xD;
your sense-to persist in this manner. I&#xD;
don't know what you mean. I am. sure I&#xD;
am willing to do any thing in reason-but&#xD;
this is quite beyond reason!"&#xD;
"Papa," said his daughter, wearily, "I&#xD;
thought you would be more considerate of'&#xD;
what I have represented to you as so ear-&#xD;
nest and urgent a desire. It was my fault&#xD;
that sent Maurice Darcy to Mexico; and I&#xD;
should feel as if I was his brother's murder-&#xD;
er if I let him set out alone on a journey&#xD;
which he cannot stand without great care.&#xD;
I have suffered-I do suffer-unutterable&#xD;
things. Oh, surely it is enough to tell you&#xD;
this, to induce yen to listen to me-to heed&#xD;
me-to go!"&#xD;
Her voice broke down in a burst of tears&#xD;
-tears of agitation which the physical&#xD;
strength was now unable to restrain-and&#xD;
after one astonished look the general struck&#xD;
his flag.&#xD;
"There, there!" he said, hastily, "don't&#xD;
cry about it! I suppose we shall have to go,&#xD;
since you have set your heart on it; hut it&#xD;
is all a confounded piece of nonsense! Dry&#xD;
your eyes-do! I hate tears! When does&#xD;
Darcy want to get off?"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RIGHT&#xD;
~' As soon as possible."&#xD;
"Humph I-there might possibly b4&#xD;
more definite information. Where is he&#xD;
I had better see him about the matter."&#xD;
"He is in the saloon. Shall I ask him t&#xD;
come to you?"&#xD;
"Yes," said the general, still rathe]&#xD;
shortly.&#xD;
She left the room-a degree more light.&#xD;
hearted and light-footed than when she en~&#xD;
tered it-and went to the saloon.&#xD;
When she reached the door, she wa~&#xD;
not a little astonished, for she had not expect.&#xD;
ed to see anybody but Gaston and Netta;&#xD;
and there before Mr. Darcy's chair stood a&#xD;
tall figure that looked like Eugene, and yet&#xD;
was not Eugene; and which, turning when&#xD;
she entered, proved to be Charley Hautaine.&#xD;
There followed all the rush of unexpected&#xD;
greeting and welcome, for she had thought&#xD;
him far away in Hungarian barracks, with&#xD;
little or no hope of meeting soon again.&#xD;
When this subsided, it was Netta who said:&#xD;
"You have come just in time. He only&#xD;
arrived a few minutes ago, and oh, Valerie,&#xD;
he says that he is going to Mexico! "&#xD;
To Mexico! Were they all crazy, or had&#xD;
she gone distraught herself? She looked&#xD;
from one to another, from Hautaine's reso-&#xD;
lute face to Netta's swimming eyes, and then&#xD;
to Gaston's pale cheek.&#xD;
"What does it mean?" she asked.&#xD;
"It means that I am going for Maurice,"&#xD;
answered Charley, quietly. "There is no&#xD;
use in anybody's saying a word. I deter-&#xD;
mined to go as soon as I heard of the em-&#xD;
peror's death; and my furlough is made&#xD;
out. I know all about the country. I have&#xD;
been there time and again; and I think I&#xD;
~know one or two people on whom it is pos-&#xD;
sible to count. I am all ready to start, and&#xD;
I only came out of my way thus far to tell&#xD;
Gaston that he might set his mind at rest,,&#xD;
for that I will find his brother."&#xD;
"It is like you, Charley, to mean it,"&#xD;
Gaston said; "but for all that, it must not&#xD;
be. Stop! I have a rig~it to speak, and I&#xD;
will do so. For you, an ~Austrian officer, to&#xD;
go to Mexico now, would be to rush into&#xD;
danger of the worst kind, and-"&#xD;
"Do you suppose I mean to wear my&#xD;
uniform, or carry my commission in my&#xD;
&#xD;
OF REPARATION.                       211&#xD;
pocket?" Hautaine interrupted, half-vexed-&#xD;
s ly, half-amusedly. "You may trust me for&#xD;
that. If the devils find out who and what I&#xD;
am, I shall deserve to be shot, and there's an&#xD;
end of the matter. But I mean to come&#xD;
back safe and sound to you and to Mix."&#xD;
"I wonder what Alix will say when she&#xD;
hears of this?" Netta cried.&#xD;
"She said, 'God-speed,"' Charley an-&#xD;
swered, with his eyes brightening. "Did&#xD;
you think I came through Germany with-&#xD;
out seeing her ?-and did you think that&#xD;
* she, of all women, would put an obstacle in&#xD;
my way? No; she said, 'God-speed,', and&#xD;
she meant it!&#xD;
"It must not bet" Gaston repeated~ "I&#xD;
* should never forgive myself-Maurice would&#xD;
never forgive me-if you came to harm.&#xD;
Charley, it must not be!"&#xD;
"My dear, good fellow, what is the use&#xD;
of this?" said Charley, good-humoredly.&#xD;
"I am going. Really, if you are so. un-&#xD;
reasonable, I shall be sorry I did n~t sail&#xD;
from Trieste; but I wanted to see you-&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"And Alix," said Netta.&#xD;
"Yes, and Alix-God bless her? So&#xD;
there's no earthly good in talking about it.&#xD;
The thing is settled."&#xD;
"It must not be," Gaston said, repeating&#xD;
those fQur words, as if they were his strong-&#xD;
hold of defence. Nobody knew, what a&#xD;
temptation this was fo him, or how hard it&#xD;
was not to yield, not to echo Alix's "God-&#xD;
speed," and put his hopes in the strong&#xD;
loyal hands outstretched for them. But he&#xD;
thought in his heart that it wouliLbe cruelly&#xD;
selfish to do so-cruelly selfish to send this&#xD;
brave young life into danger and death, enly&#xD;
that he might learn Maurice's fate; so he&#xD;
sat in his chair, pale, but rigid as steel, with&#xD;
Maurice's own look about his mouth, repeat-&#xD;
ing the same set form, "It must not be."&#xD;
"It must be," Ilautaine said, beginning&#xD;
at lastp grow impatient. "I have told you&#xD;
before that I did not come to argue about it.&#xD;
I don't mean to argue, either-for it is set-&#xD;
tled. You have a right to say a great deal,&#xD;
Gaston; but you have no right to say that."&#xD;
"I have the best right in the world,"&#xD;
Gaston said-" the right of near relation-&#xD;
ship."&#xD;

"And I have a,. better one yet," Han-&#xD;
tame answered-" the right of reparation."&#xD;
After that, each paused and looked, at&#xD;
the other-both resolute to have their own&#xD;
way; and neither meaning to yield an inch.&#xD;
It was all perfectly unintelligible to Netta&#xD;
Pane, who thought that Charley had lost&#xD;
his senses. What was Maurice Darcy to&#xD;
0&#xD;
him, that be should cross an ocean, and go&#xD;
into the very jaws of danger for his sake?&#xD;
-aud what could he possibly mean by "the&#xD;
right of reparation?" She saw that her&#xD;
own intervention would have no effect; so&#xD;
she turned imploringly to Valerie. "For&#xD;
Heaven's sake, speak to him. Make him&#xD;
hear reason," she said. And at the mo-&#xD;
ment Valerie stepped forward between the&#xD;
two disputants.&#xD;
"Gaston, Charley is right," she said.&#xD;
"He can do more good than you can; and&#xD;
he should be the one. He can find Mau-&#xD;
rice," she went on, looking at him with her&#xD;
sad, earnest eyes; "and he will  lnd him, I&#xD;
am sure.-You are right, Charley you must&#xD;
go."&#xD;
"Of course I am right," said Charley,&#xD;
"and of course I mean to go. Gaston may&#xD;
have as many rights as he pleases; but I&#xD;
have mine, too-the right of reparation."&#xD;
"Yes," said Valerie, gravely. "You&#xD;
have that. When do you start?"&#xD;
"I leave here this afternoon, and I sail&#xD;
from Marseilles to-morrow."&#xD;
So they settled it, while Gaston saw the&#xD;
responsibility of decision quite taken from&#xD;
him, and Netta sat byin speechless indigna-&#xD;
tion. Before either of them had time to&#xD;
frame his protest in words, Valerie turned&#xD;
to Mr. Darcy.&#xD;
"Papa has consented," she said; "and&#xD;
he bade me ask you to come to him. He&#xD;
wants to consult you about our route."&#xD;
"Your best route," said Charley, "is&#xD;
from Marseilles to~ Cadiz, and thence to&#xD;
Havana. Itake it for granted you are only&#xD;
going to Cuba."&#xD;
"We are only going to Cuba, if you&#xD;
meet us there with Maurice," she said. "If&#xD;
not, I think you may probably see us in&#xD;
Mexico."&#xD;
"And then-"&#xD;
"And then I expect papa will go back&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
to Louisiana," she said, with a sigh. "You&#xD;
can go with Gaston, if you wa~it to, Charley.&#xD;
Papa will be glad to see you, and you can&#xD;
offer your advice to him."&#xD;
Charley was very willing to obey; so,&#xD;
after Mr. Darcy had gathered up his&#xD;
crutches, they took their departure, while&#xD;
Netta and Valerie, left alone, looked at each&#xD;
other silently for some time. Then-&#xD;
"Oh, Valerie, how could you do it?"&#xD;
the former cried, with a hurst of reproach.&#xD;
"What has Charley ever done that he&#xD;
should be sacrificed to-to this Maurice&#xD;
Darcy? He will be killed-I know he will!&#xD;
And then how can you answer for sending&#xD;
him on such an errand?"&#xD;
"You don't know what you are talking&#xD;
about, Netta," Valerie answered, a little&#xD;
wearily. "I did not send Charley. He&#xD;
was going of his own accord. If I had told&#xD;
him to stay, he would not have paid any at-&#xD;
tention to me. And he ought to go. You&#xD;
don't understand any thing about it-but he&#xD;
ought to go."&#xD;
"No; I don't understand any thing&#xD;
about it," Miss Fane retorted. "But I un-&#xD;
derstand this-if he is killed, you will be&#xD;
sorry for having thrown the weight of your&#xD;
influence in favor of such a mad resolution."&#xD;
"I hope he will not be killed; but you&#xD;
are mistaken-even if he were, I should not&#xD;
be sorry for having exerted my influence;&#xD;
because I believe it is his duty to go."&#xD;
"Why is it his duty? What is Maurice&#xD;
Darcy to him?"&#xD;
"He is a great deal to him. He is a man&#xD;
whom he loved, and a man whom he in-&#xD;
jured, and-and you don't know what it&#xD;
would be to Oharley, if he could do this. It&#xD;
would be paying off a greater debt, and&#xD;
lightening his life of a heavier burden, than&#xD;
you can even imaginO.~~&#xD;
Miss Pane was silenced. She did not&#xD;
understand in the least, not any more than&#xD;
she had done before; but Valerie's tone&#xD;
awed and hushed her impatient reproaches.&#xD;
When she spoke again, it was very differ-&#xD;
ently.&#xD;
"I don't pretend to judge of things that&#xD;
I know only by halves. It seems to me&#xD;
very strange; but you may be right. I&#xD;
only know that it would be hard on them&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
OUT OF THE&#xD;
all at home, and hard on that poor child in&#xD;
Germany, if any rn befalls Charley. And&#xD;
so it is settled that you go, too?"&#xD;
"Yes, settled."&#xD;
"Hum! I hope enough people are go-&#xD;
ing in search of Maurice Darcy."&#xD;
"I am going to take care of Gaston,"&#xD;
said Valerie, flushing. "Then, if-if Mau-&#xD;
rice meets us, papa and I will return to&#xD;
Louisiana."&#xD;
Miss Pane sat down in a chair, and&#xD;
looked, sadly enough, out of the window.&#xD;
"Well," she said, after, a time. "I sup-&#xD;
pose one must take for granted that some&#xD;
good will come of it, but it is very vexa-&#xD;
tious. Valerie I have only one word of ad-&#xD;
vice to offer. May I do so?"&#xD;
"Say what you please, sister of my&#xD;
soul," Valerie answered.&#xD;
"Then, if you meet Maurice Darcy, be&#xD;
wise, and don't-don't be too hard."&#xD;
"Netta!" cried Valerie, turning first&#xD;
crimson, and then pale, "what do you take&#xD;
me for, that-that you should say such a&#xD;
thing? Do you think I would go in search&#xD;
of him, if such an event as that at which&#xD;
you hint was, in the least, possible? It is&#xD;
a good thing that duty bids me do this, or&#xD;
such grievous injustice would make me stay&#xD;
where I am."&#xD;
"Now you look like yourself," said Miss&#xD;
Pane, approvingly. "It is really a pleas-&#xD;
ure to see you angry once more."&#xD;
"I am not angry. I am only indignant&#xD;
and grieved."&#xD;
"Because I wish you to be kind and&#xD;
forgiving toward a man who may be dead."&#xD;
"Netta 1-how can you?"&#xD;
"None of us are immortal, Valerie,"&#xD;
said her friend, gravely. "I. havft.noticed I&#xD;
lately that these letters have made you&#xD;
buoy yourself with hope that may prove&#xD;
false, and render the final truth harder to I&#xD;
bear." t&#xD;
"Netta, you are cruel."&#xD;
"No, Valerie. But, I do not think ~&#xD;
there s any probabilityJL-only a faint possi- ,~&#xD;
bility-that he may be alive. And I want s&#xD;
to ask you, how you can cherish resent- a&#xD;
ment against a mere memory?"&#xD;
"I-resentment? Oh, God forbid!"&#xD;
"You forgive him, then?"            n&#xD;
&#xD;
3AWS OF DEATH.                      213&#xD;
"I havo nothing to forgive. Forgive-&#xD;
ness would need to come from him."&#xD;
"And why could you not say as much&#xD;
to him if he were living?"&#xD;
"Because it would be worse than use-&#xD;
less. It would humiliate me as a woman&#xD;
should never be humiliated; and it would&#xD;
not move him. I can see how he would&#xD;
look-as he looked at Oharley. You don't&#xD;
know him-he is as hard to himself as he is&#xD;
to others."&#xD;
"I am not sure that I care about know-&#xD;
ing him, under those circumstances," said&#xD;
Miss Pane, rising. "When do you start?"&#xD;
"Next week, I expect. At least as soon&#xD;
as we can get ready."&#xD;
~ This proved to be very soon. Five days&#xD;
later, they sailed from Marseilles-westward&#xD;
bound for the Queen of the Antilles.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
OUT OF THE JAWS OF DEATH.&#xD;
"MAURIcE! Maurice I',&#xD;
Such was the sick man's yeai~ning cry from&#xD;
morning till night-ever tossing in restless&#xD;
delirium-ever calling on that name, which&#xD;
was now, in all pl'obabiity, only a name.&#xD;
Many times had Valerie cause to think&#xD;
God that she had persevered in her resolu-&#xD;

~f the New World, when he was stricken&#xD;
lown by a sudden illness-arising, the phy-&#xD;
~icians said, from mingled physical exhaust-&#xD;
on and mental anxiety-which, but for her&#xD;
presence , would have cast him helpless on&#xD;
he hands of menials and strangers. As it&#xD;
ras, the care he received coul4 not possibly&#xD;
iave been more tender, or more unremit-&#xD;
ing, if his own sister had rendered it.&#xD;
)ay and night, she scarcely left his side;&#xD;

noan which seemed an echo of her own&#xD;
ad heart-that voice, plaintive and pitiful&#xD;

"Maurice! Mauricel"&#xD;
Only that-through long hours of Lever,&#xD;

&#xD;
VALERIE AYLMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a fierce fight with the death-an-&#xD;
gel over that prostrate form, for many days.&#xD;
Through the scorching heat of the tropic&#xD;
noon, and the glorious beauty of the tropic&#xD;
nights, Valerie never stirred from beside&#xD;
the pillow on which that lined and wasted&#xD;
face lay, or suffered any other hand than&#xD;
hers to press to the burning lips their cool-&#xD;
ing draught. "It is only what I came to&#xD;
do," she said, when her father remonstrated,&#xD;
saying that such close attendance in a&#xD;
sick-room was impairing her own health.&#xD;
"After he is gone, it will not matter."&#xD;
And often, as she kept lonely vigil in the&#xD;
dim chamber-telling over her beads, like a&#xD;
Sister of Mercy, during the long hours-&#xD;
while that constant cry came from the&#xD;
parched lips of the man whom she thought,&#xD;
even then, in Azrael's arms, she would bow&#xD;
her head yet lower in awesome prayer; for&#xD;
it seemed as if the brother's spirit beckoned&#xD;
from the silent land to the yearning love&#xD;
which made this ceaseless moan, and spoke&#xD;
a summons from the shores where hands,&#xD;
oflce clasped, unclasp no more at the bid-&#xD;
ding of grief and pain.&#xD;
No one dreamed that he would recover,&#xD;
that ~ constitution so shattered could en-&#xD;
dure so great a shook; but at last the crisis&#xD;
came, and resulted favorably. Then he&#xD;
once more opened his eyes to the daylight,&#xD;
and knew the faces around him. lie did&#xD;
not ask the length or severity of his own&#xD;
illness; he only held out his hand to Valerie&#xD;
with one question:&#xD;
"Any news of Maurice?"&#xD;
And she could only utter in gesture that&#xD;
negative so hard to speak, so harder yet to&#xD;
feel.&#xD;
"Who is this 'Maurice' for whom he&#xD;
inquires so constantly?" asked the physi-&#xD;
cian, somewhat impatiently, of General Ayl-&#xD;
inert when the latter followed him from the&#xD;
sick-room. "He has done nothing but call&#xD;
him evcr since his first hour of fever."&#xD;
'.' He is his brother," the general replied,&#xD;
with brevity more commendable than grati~:&#xD;
fying.&#xD;
"His brother? Then why does he not&#xD;
come to him, and relieve hi~ mind?"&#xD;
" Unfortunately, nobody knows where he&#xD;
is.&#xD;
&#xD;
"He was one of Maximilian's officers,"&#xD;
said the general, feeling obliged to answer&#xD;
that little interrogative interjection, "and&#xD;
has never been heard of since the fall of&#xD;
Queretaro."&#xD;
"Indeed! Shot, no doubt."&#xD;
"No doubt."&#xD;
"A good many officers were," said the&#xD;
doctor, philosophically. "And does his&#xD;
brother still hope to hear from him?"&#xD;
"'He came to Cuba for this purpose."&#xD;
"Poor fellow! Well~ well, let himhope,&#xD;
for the time being. A strain on the mind is&#xD;
bad; but despair might be worse. You&#xD;
must take him, as soon as possible, to a less&#xD;
enervating climate. Good-morning."&#xD;
A few days later, one of the gallant For-&#xD;
eign Legion, who stood so nobly by their&#xD;
royal chief to the very last-the same Valdor&#xD;
concerning whom Maurice had once written&#xD;
to Gaston-joined General Aylmer, as he&#xD;
was slowly sauntering along the Plaza&#xD;
d'Armas, in the brilliant glow of the tropic&#xD;
sunset.&#xD;
"No news of poor Darcy yet!" he said.&#xD;
"I am really afraid we must surrender all&#xD;
.hope. How is his brother to-day?"&#xD;
"Better," answered the general. "The&#xD;
feveg has left him, and he has his head back&#xD;
again-but he is very weak."&#xD;
"Yes, of course-people always are. Is&#xD;
he well enough to see visitors? I was re-&#xD;
fused admittance very summarily the other&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Oh, I suppose so. That is-" as a timely&#xD;
recollection of Valerie occurred to him-" I&#xD;
will inquire. But perhaps it would be as&#xD;
well if you did not come. He might think&#xD;
you brought news of his brother."&#xD;
"Ma foi, I wish I did!" said the other,&#xD;
heartily. "A better soldier-well, well, it&#xD;
is only the chances of war, and may be mine&#xD;
to-morrow. I hear that Yafies has been&#xD;
made prisofter and shot," he went on.&#xD;
"That looks badly for him-IDarcy, I mean."&#xD;
"Who is Yafies?"&#xD;
"Yafies! Vraiment! I wonder you&#xD;
never heard. He was the boldest, bloodiest&#xD;
guerrilla-chief in all Mexico-the one to&#xD;
whom Darcy was sent."&#xD;
"And he has been shot?"&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
215&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes-together with most of his com&#xD;
mand. Poor fellow! He was a perfect&#xD;
devil for fighting, and was said to have pul&#xD;
an end to more than a hundred Liberal dog~&#xD;
with his own cuehillo."&#xD;
The general shrugged his shoulders, wiff&#xD;
a laugh. "He is a great loss, then," he said&#xD;
"Such a man as that is a loss at any time-&#xD;
especially in Mexico. And you think this&#xD;
looks badly for Captain Darcy?"&#xD;
"Of course. If he was taken with Yafles,&#xD;
there was an end of the matter."&#xD;
The general was silent, and looked so&#xD;
disturbed, that, from respectful sympathy,&#xD;
his companion was silent also. Yet, in truth,&#xD;
he was thinking less of Darcy than of Hau-&#xD;
tame, concerning whom, or from whom,&#xD;
they had heard nothing. "I hope he will&#xD;
not be fool enough to risk his head," the&#xD;
general thought, feeling more irritated than&#xD;
ever against Maurice Darcy-if, indeed, any&#xD;
increase of irritation were possible. As much&#xD;
as he liked anybody not immediately con-&#xD;
nected with himself he liked Hautaine; and&#xD;
it provoked him beyond the bounds of pa-&#xD;
tience to think that the young free lance had&#xD;
rushed headlong into such danger as that&#xD;
which certainly threatened him-and for&#xD;
what?&#xD;
When he came back from his walk, he&#xD;
told Valerie that he had met young Valdor,&#xD;
and that the latter wished to see Mr. Darcy.&#xD;
"It is impossible," she said. "He would&#xD;
only come and talk of Maurice, and of all the&#xD;
chances for and against his safety, until Gas-&#xD;
ton's fever would be brought back. He is&#xD;
too weak to see anybody. Pray tell Captain&#xD;
Valdor so, the next time you see him."&#xD;
"But the doctor said he might see a few&#xD;
visitors."&#xD;
"I cannot help that. I think I know his&#xD;
state better even than the doctor does. At&#xD;
all events, I cannot consent that any risk&#xD;
should be run."&#xD;
"The doctor says he must be taken away&#xD;
from this climate as soon as possible."&#xD;
"He will never c5nsent to leave the&#xD;
island until there is some certain informa-&#xD;
tion about Maurice."&#xD;
The general was on the point of saying,&#xD;
"Confound Maurice! "but he-stopped him-&#xD;
self in time. "He need not leave the&#xD;
&#xD;
OUT OF THE JAWS OF DEATH.&#xD;
&#xD;
- island," he answered. "He can go to the&#xD;
hill-country."&#xD;
"You can speak to him about it yourself,&#xD;
papa. But I doul~t if he will consent even&#xD;
to that."&#xD;
"He had better, or he will not have an&#xD;
option long of consenting to any thing."&#xD;
"Does the doctor think that removal is&#xD;
absolutely. necessary?"&#xD;
"lie said so."&#xD;
Yale~ie sat twisting and nutwisting, with&#xD;
absent fingers, the watch-chain that hung at&#xD;
her girdle, while her eyes gazed past her&#xD;
father, full of painful thought-gazed out&#xD;
of the window, through which came the soft&#xD;
murmur of a fountain playing in the court&#xD;
below.&#xD;
"I know how Gaston will feel," she said&#xD;
at length; "because I share the feeling my-&#xD;
self-a sort of instinct that we ought not to&#xD;
leave here."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
The general spoke sharply, because he&#xD;
was irritated.&#xD;
"I don't know that there is a 'why,'&#xD;
papa. It is, as I said, only an instinct which&#xD;
I feel. But I know that he feels it, too-an&#xD;
instinct that we shall receive news of Man-&#xD;
rice, or at least of Charley, if we only wait&#xD;
long enough."&#xD;
"I hope that you will notput such ideas&#xD;
into his bead."&#xD;
"You may trust me not to do that. But&#xD;
I think you wrn find them there, all the&#xD;
same. Besides, you forget that we promised&#xD;
Charley he should find us here."&#xD;
The general was so vexed and uncom-&#xD;
fortable, that this last remark quite upset&#xD;
him, and he could not forbear endeavoring to&#xD;
make Valerie share, if not his vexation, at&#xD;
least his discomfort.&#xD;
"I don't know that you need consider&#xD;
Hantaine," he said, significantly. "From&#xD;
what I hear to-day, it seems very probable&#xD;
that he has found the fate he might have&#xD;
expected."&#xD;
"Papa! "-it was a long gasp, and the&#xD;
pale face looked at him full of quivering&#xD;
apprehension-" papa! - what have you;&#xD;
heard?"&#xD;
"Not much - nothing directly about&#xD;
him," answered the general, sorry now that~&#xD;

he had spoken.. "Only you remember he&#xD;
said he knew some of those guerrilla-chiefs,&#xD;
and that he was going to them-well, one&#xD;
of the most noted has been captured and&#xD;
shot."&#xD;
"Do you remember the name&#xD;

Valerie shook her head. "I don't think&#xD;
that was one of the names Charley men-&#xD;

you tell me any thing so horrible?"&#xD;
*            "I don't know, I am sure," said the&#xD;
general, hastily. "But don't alarm your-&#xD;
*         self foolishly, Valerie. I certainly did not&#xD;
mean you to do that. This -uan's death&#xD;
may have no connection with Hautaine."&#xD;
"But Maurice !-has it any connection&#xD;
with him?"&#xD;
"Hem 1-well I do not know," said the&#xD;
general, who thought he had done mischief&#xD;
enough for once. "We will hope not.&#xD;
Now, can I see Mr. Darcy?"&#xD;
'~ 0, papa, for Heaven's Sake, don't men-&#xD;
tion this to him."&#xD;
"Do you think I am crazy?" asked the&#xD;
general, sharply. "Of course I have not an&#xD;
idea of doing so. I would like to speak to&#xD;
him about going to the hill-country, though.&#xD;
Can I see him?"&#xD;
"I will go and find out."&#xD;
She glided away, with, the noiseless&#xD;
tread of a born sce~r de bons seeo~ts's, and&#xD;
entered the sick man's room. The shaded&#xD;
lamp burned so low that she could only see&#xD;
the outline of his figure, and tbis was so&#xD;
motionless that she thought he was asleep.&#xD;
Pausing a moment, however, to bend over&#xD;
the table and discover if Watkins' had ad-&#xD;
ministered the usual night-draught, his&#xD;
voice called her name.&#xD;
"I thought you were asleep," she said,&#xD;
approaching the bed. "Indeed, I think it&#xD;
would be better if you were."'&#xD;
"Papa wants to see you, and, if I tell&#xD;
~iim to come in, he will talk so much that&#xD;
there will be rio sleep for you to-night."&#xD;
"Has he any thing to tell me?"&#xD;
"No: he only wants to inquire how&#xD;
you are."&#xD;
"' Oh!" he gave a little weary sigh-the&#xD;
&#xD;
weariness of hope IQug deferred. "Let&#xD;
him come in."&#xD;
"Will you promise not to talk much?"&#xD;
"Yes-indeed, I am not likely to be&#xD;
tempted. After the general has asked me&#xD;
how I feel, hoped I will soon be better, and&#xD;
said that the weather is very warm, our&#xD;
topics of conversation are nearly exhausted."&#xD;
"He has another one to-night," Valerie&#xD;
thought, but she did not say so. She con-&#xD;
tented herself with another caution, and&#xD;
then went to summon her father. "Don't&#xD;
talk to him much, papa," she said; and the&#xD;
general promised he would not. Not that&#xD;
this#romise stood for much-he made it&#xD;
every time he paid a visit, and generally for-&#xD;
got it two minutes after-but Valerie al-&#xD;
ways exacted it, as a sort of precautionary&#xD;
measure that would keep her own conscience.&#xD;
clear, if it did no other good.&#xD;
Left alone in the sitting-room, she went&#xD;
to the window, and, resting her arms on the&#xD;
sill, looked mournfully forth at the glorious&#xD;
tropic night, at the heavens, brilliant with a&#xD;
radiance unknown to colder latitudes, and&#xD;
at the Southern Cross-that constellation of&#xD;
her unhappy country-which was burning&#xD;
just above her head. They were near the&#xD;
harbor; and now that there was a breeze&#xD;
from the northward, she could hear the&#xD;
waves breaking with sullen, regular sound&#xD;
against the parapet. Ah, ft was weary work&#xD;
-this waiting-this hoping-this expecta-&#xD;
tion-this continual disappointment! some-&#xD;
times-to-night, for instance-she felt how&#xD;
vain it was; she felt certain that he would&#xD;
never come back again; that there would&#xD;
never be another meeting until it was given&#xD;
to the disembodied spirits. And it was&#xD;
hard-very hard, she thought-that his last&#xD;
recollection of her should have been angry,&#xD;
passionate, and defiant !-her last picture of&#xD;
him cold, stern, and forbidding! Oh, had&#xD;
they but been a little wiser-on either side,&#xD;
a little more patient-how different it all&#xD;
would have been! Alas! alas! There&#xD;
would be no bitterness in retrospection, if&#xD;
there were not always such thoughts as&#xD;
these; if from the past there did not rise up&#xD;
those mournful shades of harsh words and&#xD;
wronging thoughts, of unkind looks and&#xD;

with a richer, deeper timbre than is usual in&#xD;

"No-never tired, if I can only succeed and beauty as the English poet's immortal&#xD;

"I-believe not. Music pains me when    It was some little time after this that&#xD;

&#xD;
"But I do blame papa. He ought not&#xD;
to have mentioned the matter to you. I&#xD;
told him you could not see visitors."&#xD;
"He did nQt mention ~ said Mr. Darcy,&#xD;
eagerly. "I asked him if he had met Val-&#xD;
dor lately, and said I was very anxious to see&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Why are you anxious to see him?&#xD;
What good will it do?"&#xD;
"I want to hear once more all that he&#xD;
thinks about Maurice," he answered, sadly.&#xD;
"I want to know his opinion now-be is&#xD;
better able to judge than we are. And, if I&#xD;
am to be taken away, I want him to prom-&#xD;
ise that he will let me know-any thing he&#xD;
may hear."&#xD;
Valerie sighed. But it was too late for&#xD;
expostulation. Her father was already re-&#xD;
questing admittance at the door, and, a few&#xD;
moments later, Gaston was warmly clasping&#xD;
the hand of the young officer who had been&#xD;
Maurice's sworn comrade and friend.&#xD;
"Come, my dear," said General Aylmer&#xD;
to his daughter, "I insist upon your taking a&#xD;
little exercise while Captain Valdor is here.&#xD;
He will entertain Mr. Darcy."&#xD;
"Pray, mademoiselle, go," said the&#xD;
young man. "You are looking pale-and I&#xD;
assure you Mr. Darcy shall not be dull while&#xD;
you         ~&#xD;
Gaston seconded the request; and, al-&#xD;
though she did so with much reluctance,&#xD;
Valerie was forced to submit. Yet, as she&#xD;
tied on her bonnet, and looked in the mirror&#xD;
at her pale face and sunken eyes, she began&#xD;
to think herself that a little fresh air might&#xD;
not be amiss. So she negative her father's&#xD;
proposal of a 'eoZante, and, saying that she&#xD;
preferred to' walk, took his ~rm as they&#xD;
turned away from the ports coch~re.&#xD;
"Let us go down to the Cortina," she~&#xD;
said. "I have heard the waves all day, amid&#xD;
I want to see them."&#xD;
Down to the Cortina they went accord-&#xD;
ingly. Something of a gale had been blow-&#xD;
ing all day, and the sea was dashing in high,&#xD;
angry waves against the stone battlements&#xD;
of the Punta and the Moro-a sight well&#xD;
worth witnessing. It had been cloudy ever&#xD;
since daylight-was still cloudy on land-&#xD;
but afar out on the sea, beyond the barboA&#xD;
lay a glory of sunlight gilding the foam-&#xD;
&#xD;
crested waves, as they rolled in with a so5d&#xD;
like distant thunder, and shining on the&#xD;
white sails and tall masts of a ship just sh~p-&#xD;
lug her course between the two frown~g&#xD;
forts.&#xD;
"Look!" said Valerie, watching it with&#xD;
half-sad eyes of interest. "It seems bring-&#xD;
ing the sunlight to the shore."&#xD;
And truly it did. For even as the ship ad-&#xD;
vanced, the broad line of light advanced with&#xD;
it, and that much of gloomy shadow retreated&#xD;
sullenly back to settle yet more grayly over&#xD;
the dominion left it. Forward came the ship-&#xD;
forward the golden flood 'that was giving a&#xD;
thousand glittering sparkles to the dashing&#xD;
surf and spray. With sails outspread, like&#xD;
an angel's great white wings, the vessel bore&#xD;
down between the lofty' battlements that&#xD;
guard the entrance of the harbor-and the&#xD;
flashing glory fell over the stern fortresses,&#xD;
and gleamed upon the royal banner of Spain.&#xD;
Nearer yet the ship-and sunlight crowned&#xD;
all the rolling amphitheatre of hills, and all&#xD;
the coronals of waving palms. Nearer, yet&#xD;
nearer-and sunlight flung its broad mantle&#xD;
of gold over city, plains, and sea.&#xD;
"It has brought it to us a little too&#xD;
brightly," said the general. "You had bet-&#xD;
ter lower your veil, Valerie.~,&#xD;
But this Valerie did not care to ~do.&#xD;
She was interested in watching the animated&#xD;
scene that ensued upon the ship's coming&#xD;
to her anchorage, the bustle upon her&#xD;
deck, the boats darting over the blue water&#xD;
to her side.&#xD;
"She is from Vera Cruz," she heard a&#xD;
voice near her say. "Let us go aboard,&#xD;
and hear the last news of whom Juarez has&#xD;
been shooting.~~&#xD;
From Vera Cruz! Ah, foolish heart, be&#xD;
still! Every week comes some white-&#xD;
winged messenger from the land where&#xD;
anarchy and murder reign; but it has never&#xD;
yet borne the freight that would make its&#xD;
coming aught to you.&#xD;
But, to do Valerie justice7 her rushing&#xD;
eagerness did not anticipate his own com-&#xD;
ing. She only thought, she only hoped, for&#xD;
letters or for tidings. An~ tidings would&#xD;
be better than the suspense they had been&#xD;
enduring. We all say such things as this.&#xD;
We all say, "Any certainty is better than&#xD;
&#xD;
suspense." But when certainty awful and&#xD;
undoubted, comes, we shrink back, crying&#xD;
vainly for the mercy of that suspense&#xD;
whicl~i, at least, knew hope.&#xD;
General Aylnier was standing by his&#xD;
daughter, meditatively watching a boat&#xD;
which had just received two passengers of&#xD;
the ship, and thinking to himself how&#xD;
very uncomfortable they must have found&#xD;
the shipboard accommodations (supposing&#xD;
them to know any thing about any better),&#xD;
and how very much he would have disliked&#xD;
a voyage under such circumstances, when&#xD;
his arm was grasped with a force which&#xD;
pained even its firm muscles.&#xD;
"The devil! " he cried, turning abrupt-&#xD;
ly. "Why, Valerie, is it you? By Jove,&#xD;
your fingers have some strength in them!&#xD;
What is the matter?"&#xD;
"Papa," said Valerie, with a strange&#xD;
gasp in her voice-not heeding him at all,&#xD;
but keeping her eyes fastened in a strained&#xD;
gaze on the very boat her father huinself&#xD;
had been watching. "Papa-look! I am&#xD;
afraid to trust my own eyes? Who--who&#xD;
is that yonder?"&#xD;
~ asked the general, staring in&#xD;
the faces of all the people about him. "I&#xD;
don't see anybody I know. Where do you&#xD;
mean?"&#xD;
"Yonder--in the boat! The boat that&#xD;
has left the ship. Papa, papa, who is it?"&#xD;
The general looked, but he could make&#xD;
out nothing. He was rather near-sighted,&#xD;
however, so he mounted his eye-glass; then 1&#xD;
he saw two military-looking men, one of 1&#xD;
whom was sitting down, and the other&#xD;
standing up watching the shore. His glance&#xD;
happened to fall first on the latter, and he ~&#xD;
exclaimed joyfully:&#xD;
"Itis Charley!"                    t&#xD;
But Valerie's voice, all shaken with&#xD;
emotion, made him start, as she said:&#xD;
"It is Maurice! "'&#xD;
Then looking at the other, and the boat h&#xD;
coming nearer with every moment, he saw&#xD;
that she was right. lie, too, recognized d&#xD;
the man from whom he had parted in Bal- 5]&#xD;
timore, two years before-the soldier of&#xD;
fortune whom they had almost given over C&#xD;
as dead. He, too, knew at a~glance Mau-&#xD;
rice Darcy.                           h4&#xD;

"Papa," said Valerie, in a quick, eager&#xD;
tone (her veil was down now), "this must&#xD;
not come upon Gaston suddenly-not, at&#xD;
any rate, without some preparation. You&#xD;
stay here and meet them as swoon as they&#xD;
land, while I go and tell the news to him2'&#xD;
Before the general could utter a word,&#xD;
acquiescent or otherwise, she ha4 left his&#xD;
side and was speeding away. I&#xD;
She found Valdor gone, when she en.&#xD;
tered his room, and only Watkins mounting&#xD;
guard over his master.&#xD;
"I made him go," said Gaston, in a&#xD;
tone of apology. "He wanted to stay; but&#xD;
some one called for him, and I made him&#xD;
go."&#xD;
~ "I am glad he is gone," said Valerie,&#xD;
sinking into a chair, quite breathless; and&#xD;
something i~the tone and manner attract-&#xD;
ed the invalid's attention.&#xD;
"You seem to 'have been in haste,"&#xD;
he said, looking at her curiously.&#xD;
"Yes-I was.!'&#xD;
"Did you come back al~ne?"&#xD;
"Quite alone."&#xD;
"Why,. where is the general I"'&#xD;
"He stayed behind, to see-a friend."&#xD;
"A friend?"&#xD;
Gaston was, growing suspicious. He&#xD;
raised himself on his elbow, and the color&#xD;
came and went on his pale cheek at a rate&#xD;
that alarmed Valerie. She remembered&#xD;
suddenly the physician's warning against&#xD;
my shock or excitement, and she reared&#xD;
~hat she had not kept herself under suf-&#xD;
icient control. She rose and went to&#xD;
he bedside-outwardly calm once more,&#xD;
hough every pulse was throbbing tumult-&#xD;
iously-and stood looking down on him&#xD;
vith eyes that glowed with something of&#xD;
heir old, lustrous light.&#xD;
"Gaston," she said, and she strove in&#xD;
am, to quite steady her voice-" let us&#xD;
hank God for His great mercy-I have&#xD;
eard news of Maurice!"&#xD;
For the first time since he laid his head&#xD;
own, three long weeks before, the sick man&#xD;
wung to an upright, sitting position.&#xD;
"Of Maurice! Oh, thank God-thank&#xD;
'od! You are quite sure, Valerie?"&#xD;
"Quite sure "-she had flung herself on&#xD;
~r knees beside th&amp;amp;bed. "He is living-&#xD;

he is safe! Oh, what have we ever done to&#xD;
deserve such a great blessing?"&#xD;
"What have I ever done?" said Gaston,&#xD;
faintly. Then he closed his eyes and sunk&#xD;
back upon the pillow.&#xD;
With a frightened cry, Valerie sprung to&#xD;
the table, and seized a bottle of ammonia&#xD;
which stood there. But the swoon-if&#xD;
swoon it really was-only lasted a minute.&#xD;
He gave a gasp as he inhaled the strong aro-&#xD;
matic spirits which~ she held to his nostrils,&#xD;
and then the long lashes lifted again.&#xD;
"Don't be afraid," he whispered. "It&#xD;
was only a sudden spasm of the heart-&#xD;
from joy, you know. But joy never kills.&#xD;
I am better now. Ah, I shall soon be well,&#xD;
if Maurice is coming! Did you say he is&#xD;
coming?"&#xD;
"I hope so-I believe so. But you must&#xD;
not talk just now. I will tell you all about&#xD;
it after a while."&#xD;
"And Oharley?"&#xD;
"Charley is safe, too."&#xD;
He lay silent for a moment-then looked&#xD;
up again with an imploring glance.&#xD;
"Did he tell you he had seen Maurice?"&#xD;
" Did who tell me?"&#xD;
The man you Saw. Surely you said&#xD;
you had seen somebody who knew."&#xD;
"I-yes, I saw somebody."&#xD;
"Who was it?"&#xD;
Valerie hesitated. She did not know&#xD;
whether to tell him or not. While she hes-&#xD;
itated-wishing, and yet fearing to do so-&#xD;
part of the truth at least flashed upon Gas-&#xD;
ton. He threw his arms up, with a cry:&#xD;
"Charley! It is Charley who has come!&#xD;
oIl, where is he I-where is he?"&#xD;
~ she cried, authoritatively,&#xD;
"this~w~ll never do! I did not say it was&#xD;
Charley! You must compose yourself; or&#xD;
you will be ill again. Oh, if only the doc-&#xD;
tor was here!"&#xD;
"No," he answered," you did not say it&#xD;
was he, but I know it must have been. And&#xD;
he would never have come without Maurice,&#xD;
if Maurice was living. Valerie-" he raised&#xD;
himself up again, and caught the hand near-&#xD;
est him-" Valerie, has Maurice come?"&#xD;
"Gaston!"&#xD;
"Ab, I knew it-I knew it! Thank God!&#xD;
And-stop! There isHautaine now!"&#xD;
&#xD;
AYLMER.&#xD;
It was, indeed. As he spoke, a step&#xD;
came bounding up the stairs, the door was&#xD;
burst open without ceremony, and Hau-&#xD;
tame's handsome, bronzed face appeared, as&#xD;
Hautaine's self rushed in upon them. Of&#xD;
what ensued Valerie had only a dim con-&#xD;
ception. All of a sudden, she grew weak&#xD;
and faint, and a black mist came over her&#xD;
sight. Unconsciously, she sank into a chair&#xD;
behind the sweeping curtains of the bed, and&#xD;
she heard Hautaine's voice as in a dream,&#xD;
when he poured forth his eager story, tell-&#xD;
ing Gaston how he had found Maurice con-&#xD;
demned to death with Yafies, the guerrilla-&#xD;
chief, and on the very verge of execution;&#xD;
how it was only through those friends in&#xD;
power of whom he had once spoken, by&#xD;
their influence, and especially by their brib-&#xD;
ery, that he obtained his release in the offi-&#xD;
cial form of banishment; and how- But&#xD;
here it was that Gaston cut him short with&#xD;
a joyful cry, that rang through the room&#xD;
like music:&#xD;
"He is coming! Maurice is coming! I&#xD;
hear his step!"&#xD;
The next moment, a tall form darkened&#xD;
the door-way-a quick step crossed the&#xD;
floor- Gaston sprang forward- and the&#xD;
brothers were in each other's arms.&#xD;
For a full minute there was silence.&#xD;
Hautaine drew back, and went toward Gen-&#xD;
eral Aylmer, who bad paused in the door.&#xD;
They passed away together, but Valerie was&#xD;
fast prisoner in her retreat; and, even if she&#xD;
had not been so prisoner, she was powerless&#xD;
to move-powerless even to speak.&#xD;
Maurice's voice was the first to break&#xD;
upon the stillness-the quiver of something&#xD;
that was almost a sob in every tone.&#xD;
"Gaston, Gaston, can I ever forgive my-&#xD;
self? Brother the best !-friend the dearest!&#xD;
-to think that I should, in my selfishness,&#xD;
have gone away and left you to suffer like&#xD;
this, alone!"&#xD;
"Brother, no-not alone," Gaston~ an-&#xD;
swered. "There has been one who has&#xD;
taken even your place !-one who has&#xD;
soothed my pain, and nursed my sickness,&#xD;
like an angel sent from Heaven !-one, but&#xD;
for whom I should never have lived to look&#xD;
upon your face again!"&#xD;
