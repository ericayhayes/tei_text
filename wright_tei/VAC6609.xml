               <p>HELP! help! a woman's voice called out imploringly as a carriage dashed down a
                  narrow street. But on the carriage went, over curb-stones, around a corner, and at
                  last over a pile of bricks in front of an unfinished building. In a moment the
                  occupants were thrown on the gravel before them, and from the woman's head there
                  trickled a stream of blood.</p>
               <p>There was the usual excitement, and a rough crowd, such as would naturally be
                  drawn from such a locality, which came with loud exclamations of pity and
                  surprise, but none seemed disposed to offer help.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" asked Dr. Brainard, driving up and addressing some of the
                  spectators who had gathered around.</p>
               <p>"There has been a runaway, and I guess the woman is killed," said a man
                  carelessly.</p>
               <p>"Hold my horse, and let me see," said he, tossing him the reins and making his way
                  through the crowd.</p>
               <p>"My God! it is Mrs. Benoir," said he, gazing oh the fair features of the lady on
                  the ground before him.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6609-00000005"/>
               <p>"Some one bring me my buggy immediately," he cried. "There, lift her
                  carefully."</p>
               <p>"What shall we do with the driver?" asked a bystander.</p>
               <p>The doctor turned and looked a moment at the red, bloated face of the drunken
                  coachman, and said, "It would serve him right to leave him where he is—he is not
                  much hurt, I think—but carry him in there," pointing to a small grocery near by,
                  "and call Dr. Irvin to attend him. Now, my man, drive as quickly as possible to
                  No. 30—Avenue."</p>
               <p>"A shriek from the servant that opened the door put the house in commotion, and
                  the other servants gathered around with terror-stricken faces, as the apparently
                  lifeless form was carried up the steps.</p>
               <p>"Is she dead?" asked one.</p>
               <p>"No, but she is seriously hurt. Send for Mr. Benoir, immediately, and for Cora,
                  too, if she is not at home."</p>
               <p>The words had scarcely left his lips when a pale, slight girl, of perhaps fifteen,
                  appeared at the door and asked in surprise, "What is the matter, Dr. Brainard?"
                  then darting to his side, cried, "She is not dead! oh, tell me she is not
                  dead!"</p>
               <p>"No, Cora," said he, looking pityingly at the pallid face that was upturned so
                  imploringly, "but I dare not tell you she will live."</p>
               <p>She let go of the doctor's hand and followed them into the room, then stationed
                  herself by the bed on which they hall laid her mother, and said, "This is my
                  place; now I am ready to do anything you wish."</p>
               <p>"Hold this bandage," said Dr. Brainard, quietly.</p>
               <p>He bound up her head, gave her a potion, and then sat down to await the
                  result.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benoir came in affrighted, went to the bed-side and looked at his wife, then
                  at the doctor, to see if his countenance would give him a ray of hope, but it did
                  not, and he sat down and buried his face in his hands.</p>
               <p>Hour after hour dragged by, but still no change in the sufferer. She lay in an
                  unconscious state, her pulse giving sign that there was life, and nothing
                  more.</p>
               <p>"Doctor," said Mr. Benoir at last, "I cannot stand this; something must be
                  done."</p>
               <p>"Nothing more can be done," replied he, "but I will send for Dr. Lamond."</p>
               <p>A messenger was sent, Dr. Lamond came, looked at Mrs. Benoir, and then the two
                  went out to hold a consultation.</p>
               <p>The little bronze clock on the mantel was just on the stroke of twelve when they
                  again entered the room. Dr. Lamond came forward, felt her pulse, pushed gently
                  back the long, dark hair, laid his hand on her head, then folded his arms and
                  watched her.</p>
               <p>"Will she live, doctor?" asked her husband, tremulously.</p>
               <p>He did not reply.</p>
               <p>As her husband uttered these words, Mrs. Benoir, for the first time, unclosed her
                  eyes, looked up at the group around her, then gave a little, shiver, as if her
                  feet had already touched the cold waters of death.</p>
               <p>"Doctor, she will live! See, she is conscious!" said Mr. Benoir, bending over
                  her.</p>
               <p>She looked up at her husband and said faintly, "No,<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000006"/> Hugh, I cannot live; I am dying now; ere the
                  morning dawns I shall be at rest."</p>
               <p>A low groan broke from her husband's lips, and Cora, who until now had been calm,
                  sobbed aloud.</p>
               <p>"Hugh," said she, laying her hand tenderly on his bowed head, "you must not grieve
                  so. I could wish to live for yours and Cora's sake, but God knows best. "My poor
                  child," said she as Cora took her hand, "It is hard to leave you." "You must be a
                  father and a mother both to her, Hugh, and in the days to come you will not forget
                  me, will you, my husband?"</p>
               <p>"Never, never, my darling wife!" said he taking her head in his arms, while a
                  great sob choked his manly voice.</p>
               <p>"You are exciting your wife, Mr. Benoir," said Dr. Brainard.</p>
               <p>"No, doctor, nothing can excite me now, and you will not deny me this last, sweet
                  privilege," said she pleadingly.</p>
               <p>The kind old doctor bowed his head, and motioning to Dr. Lamond, they both went
                  out and closed the door, and the three were left together for the last, last time.
                  When the doctor returned, Cora lay on the bed, crying piteously, the father with
                  his head bowed in his hands, but the spirit of the mother had passed beyond.</p>
               <p>The room was shrouded in oppressive gloom, the pall of darkness hung over the
                  whole place. In the middle of the room, on a marble table, rested the casket in
                  which lay the dead, robed for her last home. Death did not seem to have touched
                  her, for she lay there like one asleep, her head turned gently aside, and the soft
                  brown hair was parted carelessly over her brow, while her hand clasped a rosebud
                  on her breast.</p>
               <p>It was nearing the time for the funeral, and Cora stole into the room to take a
                  last look at her mother. "Oh, my mother!" she cried, as she kissed the lips that
                  evermore would be mute, "how can I ever live without you!" Then feeling her utter
                  loneliness, she threw herself into a chair, and hiding her face in the curtains of
                  the window, wept long and softly to herself.</p>
               <p>Some one entered the room. She looked up and saw it was Dr. Brainard. He did not
                  notice her, but stood with folded arms, looking at the still, cold form before
                  him. With tears coursing down his cheeks, he stooped and kissed the pale brow,
                  tenderly, reverently, then Went out arid closed the door.</p>
               <p>A hot flush mounted to Cora's brow, but it died away as quickly as it came. "They
                  were children together," she reasoned, "and he has been our physician for years.
                  Who knows but he may have loved her, and even if he did not, they have been
                  friends long enough for me not to be angry at this little act of love and respect,
                  given for the last time."</p>
               <p>"Cora," said a servant, entering the room, "could you not persuade your father to
                  eat something? He has not tasted food since your mother died."</p>
               <p>"I will try," said Cora, and going out to the kitchen, she took the waiter of
                  dainty food the cook had prepared and went into the library where her father
                  was.</p>
               <p>"Father," she said, softly, "I have brought you a cup of coffee."</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6609-00000007"/>
               <p>He shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Come father, drink it, you will be sick if you do not. You are feverish now,"
                  said she, laying her hand on his brow.</p>
               <p>He motioned it away.</p>
               <p>"Father," said she, putting down the cup, "is it not enough for me to be left
                  motherless? Do you want to die and leave me, too? Who would care for me when you
                  were gone?"</p>
               <p>"Cora, I would do anything to please you but the very thought of food makes me
                  sick."</p>
               <p>"But only try to drink a little coffee, you are so weak."</p>
               <p>He took the cup from her hand, tasted it, and then put it down, saying, "Cora,
                  urge me no more, for I cannot."</p>
               <p>She kissed her father, and taking the untasted food, left the room.</p>
               <p>"The Lord gave, the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord," said the
                  gray-haired minister, as the clods fell with a dull sound into the grave, hiding
                  the loved face forever from mortal view. Sobs mingled with groans came from the
                  friends gathered there, for Mrs. Benoir had died as she had lived, beloved by all
                  who knew her.</p>
               <p>It has been said, there is no grief so great, but that in time it will wear away.
                  But people shook their heads as Hugh Benoir went by, for he looked as if years
                  instead of months had passed over him since his wife's death. His eyes were
                  sunken, his step enfeebled, and all vigor of health gone.</p>
               <p>Cora noticed the change and grew alarmed. "Dr. Brainard," said she, one day, when
                  she answered the bell and met him at the door, "are you going to see father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would urge him to take something. He grows worse each day."</p>
               <p>"I will do my best Cora, but I am afraid medicine will do him little good."</p>
               <p>"Do try," said she, clasping his hand. "I cannot bear to see him suffer so."</p>
               <p>"Ah, doctor, is that his door. "Come in."</p>
               <p>"It is of no use," said he, when Dr. Brainard recommended several things. "I do
                  not need medicine. It is this mental torture that is killing me. I feel as if I
                  can not stand it any longer. To the suggestion that he should go to Europe for a
                  time, he answered: "One can not run away from sorrow; it follows us where we will,
                  and it will not 'down at our bidding.'"</p>
               <p>"But you do not know what a wonderful invigorator the sea air is. Only try it, and
                  I am sure you will be pleased with the result. One is apt to grow melancholly when
                  shut up with none but books for company. Seriously, I think it is your duty to
                  go."</p>
               <p>"But what would I do with Cora? take her with me?"</p>
               <p>"No, not this time. I would cheerfully take her into my family and care for her
                  until your return."</p>
               <p>"But it would break her heart to part from me now, poor child! She has been
                  constantly with me since her mother died. She is very quiet, but I know she
                  suffers intensely."</p>
               <p>"I do not doubt it, such natures suffer most, but I think Cora would be glad to
                  have you go, much as it<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6609-00000008"/> might pain her,
                  for she is very deeply concerned about your health."</p>
               <p>"She is in the hall. I will call her in, and if she is willing, I will consent to
                  go," said he. Cora came in with a frightened look on her face, for she knew not
                  what she was to hear. "You are not worse, father?" asked she, going over and
                  sitting down by his side.</p>
               <p>"No, my child, but I think of going to Europe soon."</p>
               <p>"Oh father!"</p>
               <p>"But Dr. Brainard thinks it best."</p>
               <p>"It will be so hard to have you leave me," said she, turning away to hide her
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"I know it, Cora," said he, stroking her hair, "and I wish I could take you with
                  me. Would you like to stay at the doctor's while I am gone? He has kindly asked
                  that you might."</p>
               <p>"If Mrs. Bernard and Estella would have no objections, I would rather stay with
                  them than any one else."</p>
               <p>"They will have no objections, I am sure. Estella will be pleased to have one so
                  near her own age with her," said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Is that all you want with me father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes pet."</p>
               <p>"Then, if you will excuse me, I will go."</p>
               <p>"Now that it is decided, when will you start?" asked the doctor, addressing Mr.
                  Benoir.</p>
               <p>"Next week, if possible. I shall commence to make arrangements immediately." You
                  can draw on me through the bank for anything you may need, and should I never
                  return, I want you to be her guardian.</p>
               <p>"It shall be as you wish."</p>
               <p>"You will be kind to her, doctor, for she is a strange child and sensitive to a
                  fault?"</p>
               <p>"I pledge you my honor that I will be a father to her in every sense of the word.
                  I see you are tired and need quiet, and I will leave you. Be sure to take the
                  medicine I gave you. Good morning."</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>All arrangements had been made. Hugh Benoir was to start for Europe. It was the
                  last night Cora and her father would spend together for months, and perhaps
                  forever. To-morrow the house would be closed until his return. It was a sad, sad
                  evening to them both, and they proposed to spend it in her mother's room, which
                  had not been opened since Mrs. Benoir closed it herself.</p>
               <p>Cora opened the door and stood irresolute for a moment on the threshhold. It
                  seemed almost a sacrilege to enter. There was her chair drawn up by the grate, her
                  slippers beside it, on the table her embroidery and writing-desk, with the pen
                  thrown down on a half finished page. Cora looked up at her father as she noted
                  these things. He was leaning against the door, a look of intense pain on his face,
                  and his teeth tightly set over his bloodless lips.</p>
               <p>"Shall I put them away, father?" said, Cora, in a tremulous voice, moving toward
                  the table.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" said he, putting out his hand as if to shield them, "her hands placed
                  them there, leave them alone. Only one thing remove, and that is her picture over
                  the mantel; I wish to take it with me."</p>
               <p>Cora took down the picture and placed it in his hand.</p>
               <p>"My wife! my wife!" said he with emotion, as he<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000009"/> looked at the beautiful face. "Oh that you were
                  with us still!"</p>
               <p>"Father," said Cora, putting her arms around his neck, "mother is an angel now,
                  and much as we miss her dear presence, we must not wish her back. 'He doeth all
                  things well.' Let us try and remember this."</p>
               <p>"I know it, my child, but it is so hard to say 'Thy will be done.' I cannot bow
                  meekly under die rod that has stricken me. What will I do without my little
                  ministering angel, when I am far away, a stranger in a strange land?"</p>
               <p>"You must write to me then whenever you feel lonely and I will comfort you all I
                  can."</p>
               <p>"You have been a great comfort already, Cora Life would have been insupportable if
                  it had not been for you. You have waited on me without a murmur."</p>
               <p>"I had no reason to murmur, father. It was a pleasure to wait on you, and I am
                  only sorry that I cannot do more," said she, her voice trembling at the thought
                  that he would soon be too far away for her to care for him.</p>
               <p>He gathered her into his arms, and sitting down in a chair, rocked her back and
                  forth as if she were a babe he was hushing to sleep. It was a night that neither
                  forgot during the long separation that followed.</p>
               <p>The clock was striking eleven. Mr. Benoir gently unwound Cora's arms from about
                  his neck, and said, "It is late, my child, I must say good-night; and if ever we
                  meet again, I trust it will be with happier hearts. Shall I leave you here?"</p>
               <p>Cora clung to him until he closed the door, then sank down by a chair and cried,
                  "Oh Father in Heaven, spare him, spare him for my sake."</p>
               <p>The parting between Mr. Benoir and the servants, the next morning, would have
                  touched the hardest heart. There was John, and his wife who had nursed him when a
                  babe, and had grown old in his service, with tears rolling down their wrinkled
                  cheeks, bidding him God-speed. Nor was Mr. Benoir less affected, for he had become
                  greatly attached to them during these long years. Cora stood apart from them all,
                  her eyes closed, and arms folded tightly across her heart, as if that would ease
                  the pain there.</p>
               <p>"Cora, my child," said her father, crossing over to where she stood, "Don't grieve
                  so; I will come back again."</p>
               <p>"Oh, if I could only think so. I have tried to be cheerful, tried not to cause you
                  any more pain, but I cannot, cannot help it," said she, throwing herself into his
                  arms and bursting into tears.</p>
               <p>He did not hush her grief, but softly stroked her hair for a minute, then drew her
                  down by his side and talked with her pleasantly, until she had regained her wanted
                  composure and a little of her old cheerfulness.</p>
               <p>"Shall we go now?" he asked at length.</p>
               <p>She assented, and they left the house, entered the carriage, and drove down to the
                  wharf.</p>
               <p>"Ah, good morning, Hugh!" said Dr. Brainard, coming up when the carriage stopped.
                  "A fine mowing to sail; you will have a pleasant journey, no doubt. Cora, Estella
                  came down with me."</p>
               <p>The meeting between the girls was very cordial, and Dr. Brainard and Mr. Benoir
                  left them to themselves.</p>
               <p>As soon as her father left her, Cora's cheerfulness vanished, and seating herself,
                  she covered her face with her<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6609-00000010"/> hands, to
                  gain strength for the ordeal before her.</p>
               <p>"Cora," said Dr. Brainard, coming up a few minutes later and gently removing her
                  hands, "your father is waiting to say good-bye."</p>
               <p>Cora sprang up and caught her father's hands, her voice too full for utterance. He
                  clasped her in his arms, saying, "Cora, my darling child! good-bye. May God bless
                  you!"</p>
               <p>She clung to him for a moment in the agony of despair, then with a great sob let
                  him go and leaned upon E tella for support. She felt the crowd sweep by to enter
                  the steamer, but she did not look up. She heard the bell ring and knew that the
                  vessel would soon move off, but she did not heed it. Estella was frightened at her
                  mute grief, and shaking her gently by the arm, said, "Cora, your father is waving
                  to you from the deck."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Estella, how can I see him go!" she cried, still covering her face with her
                  hands.</p>
               <p>"It will be hard, I know, but you must remember that his very life depends upon
                  this journey. This separation is paining him also. Do not grieve him more by
                  causing him to bear away with him the remembrance of such a doleful face."</p>
               <p>Cora moved away from Estella, leaned over the railing, waved her handkerchief in
                  response, and remained looking outward until her father could no longer be
                  distinguished, then walked slowly back with the doctor and Estella, and entered
                  the carriage that awaited them. Leaning her head on Estella's shoulder, she wept
                  all the way to the home that was to be hers until her father should return.</p>
               <p>"My poor little girl! how I wish I could comfort you!" said the doctor when they
                  arrived at his house and he lifted her out of the carriage.</p>
               <p>At these few words, so kindly uttered, her tears burst forth anew, and she clung
                  to the doctor's hand, feeling that he alone stood between her and the world which
                  had grown so cold and dark.</p>

               <p>CORA was selfish in nothing but her grief. This she brooded over until she could
                  think or speak of nothing else.</p>
               <p>"Cora," said the doctor, coming into the room where she sat gazing out of the
                  window at the leaden clouds, with despair written on every feature of her pale
                  face, "Are you cold? Come to the fire."</p>
               <p>For a moment she continued her gaze, then turned and said: "Am I cold? Oh, yes, so
                  cold that I feel as if nothing could ever warm me into life again. My heart is as
                  dead as this!" she exclaimed passionately, laying her hand on a bunch of withered
                  flowers, "but my head is throbbing and my pulse is quick; see!"</p>
               <p>"You are nervous and need rest. I will tell Estella to go with you to your room.
                  You will feel better in the morning."</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6609-00000011"/>
               <p>"Never while I feel as bitter as I do. I don't see why I have to suffer so. What
                  have I done to deserve it?"</p>
               <p>"Cora, I am astonished to find you trying to steel your heart against God's tender
                  mercies," said the doctor, rather sternly. "Your trials are great, and I know they
                  are hard to bear, but think how many have lost both father and mother—been thrown
                  out upon the cold charities of the world with none to help them. You have a loving
                  father and friends, and are surrounded by all the luxuries wealth can give. I may
                  appear harsh, Cora, but do not mean to be. I have taken a strange interest in you
                  and can not see your loving, trusting nature hardened by the waves of distrust
                  that seem to sweep over you. Oh Cora, still trust in the God whom your angel
                  mother trusted in," said he looking sorrowfully down into the pale face that with
                  its look of suffering reminded him strangely of Beatrice.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I will think of your words," said she quietly, then slowly left the
                  room.</p>
               <p>There is no hopelessness like that of youth. In after years we can look back and'
                  know that the problem which lay so blankly before us has worked out its own
                  solution, and that it was but an opening to green fields and flowery paths wherein
                  our tired feet found rest. But to her the problem seemed so difficult, the cloud
                  stretched out so hopelessly before her life, that she lived in utter darkness. She
                  had cheered and encouraged her father because she felt it her duty, but now that
                  he was gone, and all restraint taken away, she gave up to the bitterness she
                  felt.</p>
               <p>As she sat before the fire in her room that night, pondering over the doctor's
                  words, a sense of her true condition dition flashed on her mind. Was she really
                  forsaking the teachings of her youth? God forbid! and kneeling down by her bed she
                  prayed as she never had before, not that the cup might pass by, but that He would
                  shape her path to his own choosing and make her willing to say 'Thy will be done;'
                  and out of the dust and ashes of it all, there came a new hope, a new faith, that
                  was far, far beyond her greatest expectations.</p>
               <p>"How do you feel this morning?" asked Dr. Brainard of Cora a few days after his
                  conversation with her.</p>
               <p>"Better, thank you," she replied, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear it. You must take plenty of exercise and get red cheeks, like
                  Estella's," said he, playfully pulling her curls. What a contrast there is between
                  you, you little drooping snow-drop!"</p>
               <p>There was indeed a contrast between them. Estella was tall and beautifully formed.
                  She had large, hazel eyes, with long, golden lashes sweeping her fair, oval face,
                  that was haughty in its contour; nose Grecian in shape; mouth straight and firm;
                  long, sunny hair that she wore in massive braids wound around her classic head,
                  which gave it a queenly grace. Her manner was cool and lady-like, never betraying
                  the least emotion. Cora was her opposite, slight and pale, with brown, clustering
                  curls; large, truthful, blue eyes and daintily arched brows; a mouth beautifully
                  curved, with a child-like tremor about it. There are some faces we meet which seem
                  to have a subtile influence that makes us like them in spite of ourselves. Such a
                  face had Cora Benoir. Estella was far the more beautiful; yet she lacked that
                  sweet, half shy, half sad expression that was so attractive in Cora.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6609-00000012"/>
               <p>"Where is your mother, Estella?" asked the doctor, when the breakfast bell
                  rang.</p>
               <p>"In her room. She was at Mrs. Stone's party last night, and did not get home till
                  very late."</p>
               <p>The doctor sighed. "Had you not better tell her breakfast is ready?" said he after
                  a time.</p>
               <p>"She has heard the bell."</p>
               <p>He looked at his watch, "Come let us go to breakfast, for it is time to visit my
                  patients."</p>
               <p>"From father! Why doctor, where did you get it?" said Cora, her face beaming as
                  she picked up the letter that lay on her plate, and glanced at her address.</p>
               <p>"It came this morning. The steamer remains about two hours at Halifax, and he
                  posted it there."</p>
               <p>"He is feeling better already," said Cora, as she read the letter.</p>
               <p>"No doubt, he would tell a different tale now," said the doctor, laughing.</p>
               <p>Cora looked up questioningly.</p>
               <p>"He is only sea-sick."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said she, feeling relieved.</p>
               <p>"Is he pleased with his journey, so far?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Would you like to read the letter?"</p>
               <p>He took it, read it through, then handed it back, saying, "You need not have any
                  more fears, Cora, for your father will come back as well as ever."</p>
               <p>Just as they had finished breakfast, Mrs. Brainard swept into the room, and sat
                  down at the table. She was tall and slender, with black hair and dark, piercing
                  eyes, and her clear olive complexion was in perfect harmony with the wine-colored
                  dress she wore. She was very youthful in appearance, and one would not think the
                  tall, fair-haired girl by her side, her daughter.</p>
               <p>"Good morning," said Dr. Brainard, pleasantly.</p>
               <p>"Good morning," she replied, indifferently.</p>
               <p>"The ham and eggs are cold," said she, turning to the servant who stood by her
                  chair, "and if it happens again you will lose your place, remember that,
                  Hannah,"</p>
               <p>"It was lot Hannah's fault for we waited breakfast sometime for you," said
                  Estella.</p>
               <p>"Wait until you are spoken to, if you please! Your impudence is unbearable, and I
                  will have no more of it."</p>
               <p>Estella paid no attention to her mother's angry look or words, but turning to
                  Cora, said, "Come into the library, I want to show you the book of engravings
                  father received last week."</p>
               <p>"How beautiful!" exclaimed Cora, as she turned over the leaves.</p>
               <p>"They are all Swiss scenes. What could be more picturesque than that group of
                  peasants? How I would like to go Switzerland. Nothing would please me better than
                  to clamber over the Alps, or in the long summer days, rest beside Lake Leman, in
                  sight of the snow-white battlements of Chillon, that Byron has told us about. You
                  ought to read Mr. Harmon's letters to father, they out me in a perfect fever for
                  traveling. You, I suppose, will get glowing descriptions from your father. He can
                  write again in two weeks, can he not?" she asked, addressing her father who had
                  just entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he will be safe in. Liverpool before that time, unless something unusual
                  happens."</p>
               <p>"Don't you wish you could have gone with your father, Cora?" asked Estella.</p>
               <p>"No, I want to wait until I am older, and my education<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000013"/> tion is finished, then I can better appreciate such
                  a trip."</p>
               <p>"Do you expect to go?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, it is an old dream of mine."</p>
               <p>"I hope your dream may prove a reality; I am afraid mine never will. I have been
                  coaxing father this long while to go, but he says one trip to Europe Has been
                  enough for him, and that the rest of his days he means to remain in his own
                  country."</p>
               <p>"Which is far superior to any other," put in the doctor, looking up from a note he
                  was writing.</p>
               <p>"But it is quite fashionable to go to Europe now."</p>
               <p>"Oh, is that why you wish go, Estella?" said the doctor, laughing.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, but because I really wish to see the places I have read so much
                  about."</p>
               <p>"I guess I will send you over with a party of our friends, one of these days."</p>
               <p>"This is such a beautiful morning, Cora, let us go out for a ride."</p>
               <p>"Estella, I would like td know where you are going?" said Mrs. Brainard coming to
                  the door, as they were ready to drive off. "You know Eugene is coming today, and I
                  wish you to be here to meet him."</p>
               <p>"I am not particularly anxious whether I am or not. You can entertain him if I am
                  not," and she drove off without looking at her.</p>
               <p>"How can you talk so to your mother?" said Cora.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear, you will get used to that if you remain with us long. I idolize my
                  father, but I fear I have but little love for my mother. Had you been forced to
                  bear what I have all my life, you would have cried yourself to death long ago, but
                  I am made of entirely different material terial, and such things do not hurt
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you do not always do right, Estella."</p>
               <p>"I know that I do not, but there is a point where forbearance ceases to be a
                  virtue. You know how patient my father is, and you ought to see how she treats
                  him. Why—but let us talk of something else, or I will forget she is my mother. We
                  will drive faster and try and get back before Eugene comes."</p>
               <p>"May I ask who Eugene is?"</p>
               <p>"A cousin of mine. He graduated at Princeton, last week. He is an orphan, and like
                  yourself, has but few relatives; we, I believe, being the only ones, excepting his
                  grandmother. The little village in which she lives is too quiet and monotonous to
                  suit him, and he has decided to make his home with us until he has one of his r
                  own. He is handsome and very wealthy, but I know you will not like him if he is
                  anything as he was four years ago. Mother has set her heart on making a match
                  between us, but I never saw a relative of mine that I could love well enough to
                  marry, and I would not have him if he were worth ten times as much as he is. A
                  nice life we would live! Wouldn't our wills clash!"</p>
               <p>"Does your cousin know your mother's designs?"</p>
               <p>"No indeed, and she will be careful that he does not."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Estella, this day has brought mother so vividly before my mind," said Cora,
                  as they came in sight of the large green-houses. "She was with me the last time
                  that I was here. Oh, can I ever forget her!"</p>
               <p>Estella was silent. "I am going to buy some flowers, Cora, would you like to get
                  out and go with asked she at length, trying to draw her mind from the past."</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6609-00000014"/>
               <p>"I would rather remain here."</p>
               <p>"Eugene has come," said Estella, when they arrived home. "Hear the piano; he is a
                  brilliant musician."</p>
               <p>"Cousin Estella, how glad I am to see you!" said Eugene, rising from the piano and
                  fondly kissing her, then holding her off at arms' length, he exclaimed, "What a
                  beauty you have grown to be!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you; how glad I am that I can return the compliment. This is my friend,
                  Miss Cora Benoir," said she, turning to her, as she stood in the doorway." "She is
                  staying with us while her father is in Europe, and I shall expect you to make
                  yourself very agreeable to my guest."</p>
               <p>He bowed low, placed her a chair, then went out into the next room, where Estella
                  had gone to remove her wrappings, and said, "You would not remain at home to meet
                  me," in a reproachful tone.</p>
               <p>"I did not think you would care. Accept this as a peace offering," said she,
                  taking a moss rose-bud from her boquet, and pinning it in his button-hole. "We
                  understand each other too well to quarrel," said she, looking up into his
                  face.</p>
               <p>"That means, I suppose, that you have as little confidence in me now as when we
                  were children together, and that you love me as little."</p>
               <p>"Exactly; but then you are handsome and talented, and looking at you in that
                  light, I am very proud that you are my cousin. Now don't get angry, but let us go
                  to mother and Cora."</p>
               <p>"They would suit each other so well," said Mrs. Brainard, in a low voice, to Cora,
                  "but I cannot make her think so. I shall depend on you to help me."</p>
               <p>"I abhor matchmaking," Cora replied.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>Cora colored at the ridicule the tone meant to apply, and e walking away, sat down
                  in the bay window.</p>
               <p>"What are you dreaming about?" called out Estella.</p>
               <p>Come sing this piece from Tom Moore. I want Cousin Eugene to hear what a voice you
                  have."</p>
               <p>"Please excuse me."</p>
               <p>"No, you are too modest; here is the music. I will put back the curtain so you
                  will have more light."</p>
               <p>Cora complied reluctantly. The bright rays of the sun fell through the window,
                  across her pale face, lighting it with a sunny glow as she sat at the piano, and
                  the words of the song fell from her lips as sweet and as fine as a bird's
                  warblings.</p>
               <p>"Eugene stood and watched her, with a look of admiration in his, large, dark eyes.
                  She looked so pure, so innocent, so unlike the women he had known all his life.
                  The color came and went in her cheeks, and the violet eyes filled with tears at
                  the sad, passionate words of the song. "A creature all soul!" he mentally
                  exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"She could love deeply, passionately perhaps, but could not hate. It would be
                  something to win her love. I have a notion to try, but it may grow monotonous
                  after a time. How different she is from my matchless Estella, mine at the speaking
                  of the word, if I understand my aunt aright. No, no good aunt, keep your daughter,
                  I have no relish for the truth, even though it fall from beautiful lips. I would
                  not dare to flirt with her, for she is as cold as marble, keen and swift as an
                  arrow, and besides understands me too thoroughly. But as for that little blossom—"
                  He did not finish the sentence,<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6609-00000015"/> for the
                  song was ended, and she looked up with the tears still quivering on the long,
                  brown lashes. A guilty flush spread over his face, for, traitor-like, he felt that
                  she had divined his thoughts; but the next moment the utter absurdity of the
                  feeling presented itself to his mind, and giving her a sweet smile, and a look
                  from his dark, fascinating eyes, "You sing well. Many having such a voice would be
                  tempted to go on the stage."</p>
               <p>"I have never been so ambitious; but should I ever be forced to depend on my own
                  exertions for a living, should in all probability put my voice to some use.
                  Estella has told me you were quite a musician. Please favor me with this piece,
                  from Beethoven."</p>
               <p>"People have flattered me enough to tell me that I am," said he, bowing. After I
                  am through, your verdict shall decide it.</p>
               <p>"I am not capable of judging."</p>
               <p>"Oh, but you are. This is one of my favorites," said he, taking the music from her
                  hand; "is it yours?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I admire all of Beethoven's compositions."</p>
               <p>"How I wish I could play like you," said Cora, after he had complied with her
                  request. "Your touch is so light, easy and graceful."</p>
               <p>"Yet your voice is worth it all, and you must sing for me again. Sing me this old
                  ballad."</p>
               <p>Estella looked up from the music he had, presented her a few moments before, and
                  an angry light came iuto her eyes as she noticed his lover-like behavior to Cora.
                  Would he try to blight her young life? Would he sue for her love, and having
                  gained it, toy with it, as a child would with a plaything? Yes, she knew his race
                  well. She would warn Cora. She should not be blind to his thoughts. "Cora," said
                  she, interrupting them, "see how our flowers have withered. Let us go and put them
                  in water."</p>

               <p>"CORA, are you going to school?" asked Estella, addressing her as she will you do
                  with Eugene, discussing the merits of some book, a few weeks after his
                  arrival.</p>
               <p>"I must start again sometime; I suppose I may as well go this morning," she
                  replied, rising from her chair, reluctantly.</p>
               <p>"What will you do with me?" said Eugene with mock gravity.</p>
               <p>"Leave you at home, or let you call on the ladies. You know Nina Rivers. She is
                  quite a belle, and no doubt she would be pleased to add your name to her lis of
                  admirers."</p>
               <p>"I don't like your belles, they are always such horrid flirts."</p>
               <p>"And pray what are you? It would only be 'diamond cut diamond" I think."</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6609-00000016"/>
               <p>"You misjudge me," said he, with the slightest touch of anger in his tone.</p>
               <p>No, I think not. Men of your temperament are all such. It is just as natural for
                  them to flirt as it is to breathe. But, Eugene, do spare the innocent. If you must
                  flirt, let it be with your own kind," said she seriously and in a low tone.</p>
               <p>He looked at her defiantly, a moment, then coming up to her side, said, "I shall
                  do as I please, now and always, remember that, and don't interfere."</p>
               <p>"Remember that I shall interfere, and on the first occasion, too."</p>
               <p>"And what good do you think it will do, my pretty cousin?" said he, smiling.</p>
               <p>She drew herself up proudly and left the room.</p>
               <p>There are some men so base at heart that there is no deed too dark for them to do,
                  if it will accomplish their own ends. Such a man was Eugene Tracy. Yet he had some
                  good qualities, prominent among which was his generosity. No beggar asked in vain
                  for alms. None ever poured a sorrowful tale in his ear, but that they found
                  sympathy; but where his own interests were concerned, he was selfish to the
                  heart's core. He had never known a mother's or a father's love;" they died ere he
                  was old enough to feel their influence. Perhaps, if they had lived, he would have
                  been a different man.</p>
               <p>Cora's life had been almost one of seclusion. She cared nm for society. To her it
                  held no charms, and she felt more at home with her books and her music. Yet she
                  was not unlike other girls. Sometimes her thoughts would wander off in a dreamy
                  sort of way, while visions of the future, vague yet sweet, would fill her, mind,
                  and prominent among her dreams now was a tall form of manly grace, a face handsome
                  enough to enrapture an artist. Forgive her. She was so young, so unused to the
                  ways of the world, and women older and better versed in love than she, had fallen
                  in admiration before her hero.</p>
               <p>A flush mounted to her cheek, as Eugene entered the room and stood by her side.
                  She picked up her school books to hide her confusion, but he noticed this, and
                  taking advantage of it, began his role.</p>
               <p>"I shall be so lonely to-day without you, for you are so kind, and have helped to
                  make ray time pass so pleasantly. You are so different from Aunt and Estelia."</p>
               <p>"But they do not mean to be unkind," said she, at last lifting her face,</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not; yet it has always, been so. After my father died, I remained with
                  them until I went to college, but do what I would, I could never please them. They
                  say that I have talents, that I can become-distinguished, if I choose, and I have
                  sometimes thought that I would put my wealth and learning to some use; but who
                  would be proud of me if I did? who cares if I live or die? If my parents had only
                  lived, it would have been so different. Oh, you do not know what a dreary life it
                  is live uncared for, unloved!"</p>
               <p>"No, I do not, and I trust I never may. I could not live without love. But you are
                  not uncared for. Your aunt, your uncle, your cousin care for you; they would be
                  proud to see you fill a high position in the world, and I am sure I would,
                  too."</p>
               <p>"Would you, really? Thank you. That assurance cheers me as nothing else could, and
                  will repay me for<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6609-00000017"/> long, hard years of
                  study. Believe me, trust me, be my guide, make me what I should be," said he, with
                  sudden earnestness, looking down into her clear, blue eyes; and for the moment he
                  was actually in earnest, for he obeyed every impulse whether good or bad.</p>
               <p>"I cannot shape your future life, that depends on you alone, but I will help you
                  all I can. I will be your friend always." Then she went away feeling that Estella
                  was unjust toward him, and that she had allowed herself to be influenced by her
                  words for she had' been cold and distant whenever he approached her; but she
                  resolved that hereafter she would make amends for it all.</p>
               <p>"Ladies, if you will allow me, I will walk as far as the seminary with you," said
                  Eugene, coming out of the door, as they were starting.</p>
               <p>He questioned Cora about her studies, and affected surprise when she expressed her
                  liking for Greek and mathematics.</p>
               <p>"You are so different from any one that I have met before. Don't look hurt. I am
                  better pleased with you than I ever was with any other young lady," said he,
                  softly.</p>
               <p>"Don't let him flatter you, Cora," said Estella, who had caught the smile he gave
                  her, but not the words; he has in all probability told many young ladies the same
                  he is now telling you."</p>
               <p>"How do you know?" he asked, quickly, his black eyes flashing.</p>
               <p>"Don't I know you are a flirt?"</p>
               <p>"I will not deny your accusations any more, but I will say, I can appreciate, yes,
                  I can honor truth and innocence, when I meet it."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so," said she in a tone that showed her doubt of it.</p>
               <p>"Every one would think me a scoundrel, to hear you talk," said he, angrily. "I
                  trust she understands me better than you."</p>
               <p>"It is to "be hoped, at least, that she does," she replied, indifferently."</p>
               <p>"Cora," said Estella, after her cousin had left them, "do you believe all that
                  Eugene tells you?"</p>
               <p>"You would not have me believe that Eugene tells what is untrue?"</p>
               <p>"I do not mean exactly that, but he says things that he knows can never be, that
                  he would not even desire to be. Remember that all his life he has been surrounded
                  by the gay and worldly, and he is not one to resist temptation.</p>
               <p>"Then the more charitable we ought to be with his faults."</p>
               <p>"Well, we will not quarrel. I like you, Cora, and have said this only for your
                  good. All are not so true as you are."</p>
               <p>"Don't praise me, Estella, you do not know what my feelings are sometimes."</p>
               <p>"But you are different from Eugene and me. You would scorn to tell an untruth, to
                  be any thing but what you really are. We are not always so scrupulous. Your life
                  has always been so secluded, that you know but little of the world. Perhaps I know
                  little more; but what I do know only convinces me that very few are true."</p>
               <p>"I cannot think like you, Estella. I cannot think meanly of any one until their
                  actions prove it. If my faith in every one must grow dim, let me find it out
                     myself<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6609-00000018"/> self, let me keep my trust as
                  long as I can, and when the thus comes that I cannot keep it, I will be warned,
                  but not now."</p>
               <p>"Brave words, Cora, but I am afraid your loving, trusting nature will be duped
                  some day. Madame De Bruler is waiting to speak to you."</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Cora," and Madame De Bruler cordially embraced her pupil. "I was
                  just on the point of sending for you. Blanch Wardleigh had a hemorrhage last
                  night, and begged that I would have you come to her. You will find her in her old
                  room."</p>
               <p>Cora was soon beside her friend.</p>
               <p>"Oh Cora, I am so glad to see you. It seems such an age since you were at school,"
                  said Blanch, putting her arms around her neck and kissing her.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, but sorry you are sick, I trust that you will be better
                  soon."</p>
               <p>"I know that I am worse, I feel so weak here," said she, placing her hand on her
                  chest. Father is coming to take me home to-morrow. Brother Grant has just finished
                  at Princeton, and father has made him his agent. He is going South, and will take
                  me with him for my health; but I know it will be of no use—my days are numbered. I
                  ought to have told them sooner, but I dreaded to alarm mother. You must not forget
                  me Cora, you have been my dearest friend, and sometimes you must write to me and
                  tell me all about school. I did hope I could have finished my studies before I
                  left, but it doss not matter now; I shall not need them up there."</p>
               <p>"You are gloomy, Blanch. I have great faith in a change of climate, because it is
                  already doing my father so much good, and I would not be surprised if you would
                  come back and graduate with us yet," said Cora, trying to appear cheerful,
                  although her heart almost doubted what she said.</p>
               <p>"No, Cora, I shall never be here again. I am going just as sister Grace did. If
                  Madame De Bruler is willing, you will stay with me to night, wont you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, gladly."</p>
               <p>"Estella," said Cora, going to her at recreation hour, "I will not go home with
                  you to night. Blanch will go home to-morrow and wishes me to stay with her till
                  then. She thinks she cannot get well, and I have but little hope of it myself. You
                  will excuse me?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, but is there really no hope for her?"</p>
               <p>"I have just been talking to Madame Ds Bruler. The doctor has said it would be
                  better to send her home at once, and he would hardly have said that, if she was in
                  no danger."</p>
               <p>"Where is Cora?" asked Eugene, meeting Estella on the street as she was coming
                  home from school.</p>
               <p>"She will stay with Blanch Wardleigh to night, for Blanch is going home to-morrow.
                  She and Blanch are very intimate."</p>
               <p>"Who is Blanch Wardleigh?"</p>
               <p>"She is Blanch Wardleigh of Brighton, that is all I can tell you."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if she is Grant Wardleigh's sister?</p>
               <p>"I have heard her speak of a brother Grant, at Princeton."</p>
               <p>"It is the same, then. Talking of true men, Estella, you ought to know Grant
                  Wardleigh. He is the best fellow that I ever met. He was my room-mate for the last
                  three years, and I never knew him to Commit a<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000019"/> mean act in all that while. He adores the ladies.
                  You could not convince him they were anything less than angels."</p>
               <p>"It is a pity he didn't convert you," said she, ironically.</p>
               <p>"I think I should have been dubious about you being one, if he had."</p>
               <p>She curled her lips scornfully, and walked away.</p>
               <p>Eugene follow closely behind, whistling, merrily.</p>
               <p>"Come, Estella, let us play this duet. I beg pardon for what I said to day."</p>
               <p>She came and sat down at the piano, as unconcerned as if nothing had happened.</p>
               <p>"Has not Cora a grand voice?" he asked, after they were through.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but it will never do her much good. She is so shy that she can hardly ever
                  be persuaded to sing."</p>
               <p>"She has been shielded too much like a tropical plant. She will get over all that
                  when she sees more of the world. Isn't she the most innocent creature that you
                  ever met?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and for that reason you should not take advantage of her."</p>
               <p>"I am not doing so. I assure you I admire her immensely."</p>
               <p>"I would like to know what you see in that little ignoramus to admire?" said Mrs.
                  Brainard, who just then entered the room and had caught the thread of their
                  conversation. "She is as awkward as a country girl, and too thin and pale to be a
                  beauty."</p>
               <p>"Beg pardon, aunt, but you are mistaken for once. Miss Cora is not ignorant. I
                  doubt if there are any of her age whose education is more thorough. "She is
                  bashful ful, I admit, but that has a charm for me, for I am tired of bold women."
                  He paused a moment, to see the effect of his last words, and then went on. "She is
                  not beautiful like Estella, few are, but then she is interesting, at least I think
                  so," and he smiled at the pet he had put his aunt in.</p>
               <p>"There is no accounting for men's taste, they always admire these milk-and-water
                  characters that any one can twine around their finger," said Mrs. Brainard</p>
               <p>"Just try to twine her around your finger, mother, and see how you will succeed,"
                  said Estella.</p>
               <p>"Aunt cannot expect to find every one as strong-minded as herself," said
                  Eugene.</p>
               <p>"Don't say I am strong-minded," in an angry tone. "If there is anything that I
                  detest, it is a strong-minded woman."</p>
               <p>Eugene and Estella laughed, and Mrs. Brainard haughtily swept out of the room.</p>
               <p>Cora little thought as she sat at her friend's bedside that she was the subject of
                  conversation at Dr. Brainard's, nor did she care; she only thought of her friend's
                  comfort. After she had given her the medicine the doctor had left, she asked if
                  she should finish the book they had commenced reading together before.</p>
               <p>"Yes said, Blanch," I would like to have you finish before I go home. Shade the
                  light, so that it will not hurt my eyes. There; thank you.</p>
               <p>"It, was late in the evening before the book was finished. Then they both were
                  silent, for the wierd, sad story had thrown a spell upon them that each was loth
                  to break. Cora glanced at Blanch as she lay there, her long, black hair sweeping
                  over the pillow, her dark eyes<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6609-00000020"/> closed,
                  her face thin and pale, with a hectic spot glowing on either cheek. There was a
                  sweet, patient look that one seeing could not readily forget. It looked so hard,
                  that one so young, so beautiful, should die. "Must she lose all she loved?" Then
                  she thought of her mother, and the tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
               <p>Blanch's large, dark eyes unclosed and eagerly scanned her face. "What is the
                  matter?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking of mother."</p>
               <p>"If I could only comfort you, but a few words are all the world can give, and they
                  seem cold. I have kept you up late, you ought to have been in bed long ago. It is
                  such a pleasure to know that I shall have you with me the last night that I am
                  here; and oh, Cora, do not forget me after I leave. If I am too weak to write,
                  Grant will answer your letters. I have told him so much about you, that you will
                  not seem a stranger to him, and when I am dead, think of me sometimes for the sake
                  of days that are gone."</p>
               <p>"My dear, dear friend, I never shall forget you. It grieves me to think that we
                  may never meet again."</p>
               <p>"Do not say never meet again, Cora. I will only go before, you will come by and
                  by."</p>
               <p>"You do not know how rebellious I have felt toward God, or you would not say so. I
                  would not be reconciled to my mother's death, although I would let no one know how
                  bitter I felt. Those feelings are all gone now, but will God ever forgive me?"</p>
               <p>"I felt just as you do, when Grace died. She was my twin sister; we had shared
                  each other's thoughts ever since we were old enough to talk; we read the same
                  books; we loved the same music; took pleasure in the same pursuits, and when she
                  was taken away I felt that God was cruel, that He had dealt unjustly. Mother tried
                  to reason with me, but for a long time I was deaf to it all, but now I feel that
                  He has forgiven me, and I do not fear to meet Him. I 'am getting hoarse, and will
                  stop talking and try to sleep, for I have a long journey before me to-morrow. Poor
                  father! he will find me changed. I wish that I had prepared him for the
                  worst."</p>
               <p>It was a sad group that gathered around Blanch Wardleigh in the school-room the
                  next morning, to say goodbye. Not an eye was dry, for Blanch was a favorite with
                  them all. Even Estella cried. The girls looked on in amazement, for never had
                  Estella been known to shed tears. Mr. Wardleigh was a kind, fatherly old
                  gentleman, loving his child almost to idolatry, for she was his only remaining
                  daughter, one other having been swept away just as "she was budding into
                  womanhood, by consumption. Blanch was sixteen, and had left them in the very bloom
                  of health. It was thought that she, at least, would escape the Destroyer. A few
                  weeks before, she had taken a severe cold, attended with a violent cough. She had
                  not acquainted her parents with it, thinking it would wear off, but she daily grew
                  weaker, and on summoning a physician, he pronounced it quick consumption. Mr.
                  Wardeigh looked on his daughter with a sorrowful heart, and although he talked
                  cheerfully of her recovery, it was more to cheer Blanch, who was so desponding,
                  than from any hope he entertained of it himself. Madame De Bruler had no trouble
                  in quieting her pupils that day; all were as still as if some great sorrow had
                  befallen each one of them, and when recitations were over, they went to their
                  rooms or silently wended their way home.</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6609-00000021"/>
               <p>"What is the matter?" asked Eugene of Estella, as she and Cora entered the house,
                  on their return from school.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, why?"</p>
               <p>"You looked so serious."</p>
               <p>"Is that any thing strange?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are quiet enough always, but to-night you are sad, fair cousin. Tell me
                  all about it, I am ready, to offer sympathy."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; I do not need it,"</p>
               <p>"Guess what I have for you, snowdrop?" said Dr. Brainard, addressing Cora, as he
                  stood with his arm resting on the mantel, gazing down on the trio.</p>
               <p>Cora looked up, saw a smile play around his lips, then her eyes brightened. "A
                  letter from father, I know."</p>
               <p>"Ah, you are good at guessing! Here."</p>
               <p>Cora took the letter and darted from the room. In a little while she reappeared,
                  her face beaming with joy.</p>
               <p>"Oh, doctor, he is so much better, and has met with a pleasant party of Americans
                  in Chester."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear it, and glad, too, that he is safe across the ocean."</p>
               <p>"Did your friend, Miss Wardleigh, return home today?" asked Eugene of Cora.</p>
               <p>"Yes. It was quite a struggle for her to say good bye to us. I never saw any one
                  so attached to her schoolmates. And her father was so kind."</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him, Eugene?" asked Estella.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Does his son resemble him?"</p>
               <p>"No. He is a Blonde, with perfect features, but not the least feminine in
                  appearance. The ladies, I believe, think him very handsome, and he is such a good,
                  honest est fellow, that he is a favorite with all, but this admiration has not
                  made him the least conceited or vain, and he is very intelligent, too. He bore off
                  the first honors at college.</p>
               <p>"I bought you a new book to-day, Estella—entitled Ferndale.' It was written by
                  George Graham. He lived here a few 'years ago. Don't you remember that pale,
                  slight artist, that had such sorrowful looking blue eyes?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have been at his studio, but what has become of him? I think I have not
                  seen him for two years."</p>
               <p>"He is in Philadelphia. Grant Wardleigh told me not long ago, that he was engaged
                  to his sister Grace, when she died. Speaking of Grant and his sister, last night,
                  reminded me of it to-day while in a bookstore, and I bought it, thinking you might
                  like to read it."</p>
               <p>"I shall, most assuredly since I know who the characters are."</p>
               <p>"Now Estella, read us Ferndale," said Eugene, after tea. "I feel just in a humor
                  to listen. Uncle, don't you want to hear' Ferndale?'"</p>
               <p>"I have no objections."</p>
               <p>They were all much interested in the story, when Mrs. Brainard swept into the
                  room, dressed for an evening party. She wore an amber colored silk with a bertha
                  of black lace, while jewels flashed from her neck and arms. She looked beautiful,
                  and she knew it.</p>
               <p>"You are as radiant as a star, aunt," said Eugene, gaily.</p>
               <p>"Are you going out again to night?" asked her husband.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you need not think because you stay at home,<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000022"/> that every one else must. I would not miss Mrs.
                  Fay's party for any thing. Eugene, be so kind as to see if the carriage is at the
                  door."</p>
               <p>A look of pain crossed the doctor's face, he sighed, settled back in his easy
                  chair, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>The carriage is ready, aunt, allow me to see you to it," said Eugene.</p>
               <p>"Now, Estella, go on with your reading," said he, coming back and seating himself
                  by her side.</p>
               <p>The book was half finished, and Estella was dipping into a new chapter, when the
                  doctor looked at his watch and said, "It is ten o'clock. Time we were all asleep.
                  Come, Estella, put the book away until to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Graham is an easy, pleasant writer, don't you think, Estella?" asked Eugene.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Estella, and if his life furnished the material for the book, I pity
                  him."</p>
               <p>"So do I," said Cora. "It must be terrrible to have the cup of happiness dashed so
                  suddenly from one's lips. Oh, it seems to me that I could not live, if ever I
                  loved any one as devotedly as he did Gertrude in the story, and have that person
                  taken away."</p>
               <p>"You know, Cora, some one tells us, <q>
                     <l>"Life must long be borne ere sorrow breaks the chain."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"But I would wish to die. It would not be so hard, I think, after one has grown
                  old, to lose those we loved, for we would know that there would soon be a happy
                  reunion, on the other side."</p>
               <p>"What do you think about it, Uncle?" asked Eugene.</p>
               <p>"I think, too, it would be hard to see one we loved in their youth and beauty,
                  laid in, the grave, but it would be harder to live and see love grow cold, for in
                  their graves, we would know their love went with them. But to live side by side
                  for years as though oceans rolled between, is far worse. God forbid, Cora, that
                  you should live to suffer from either," said he with emotion, forgetting,
                  apparently, the picture of his own life conveyed in his words; but he remembered
                  in a minute, and turning from them with a hasty. "Good-night," left the room</p>
               <p>A strange, gloomy feeling came over Cora. She knew not what occasioned it, whether
                  the book or his words, but she could not shake it off, do what she would. Was it a
                  foreboding of evil in store for her? she asked herself. Ah! she little knew,
                  sitting there, that the two she called her friends would be the means of making
                  her life even more pitiful than the hero's in "Ferndale!"</p>
               <p>"Next week I will be seventeen years old," said Estella to Cora, as she entered
                  her room, "and I have made up my mind to give a party. Eugene has promised to make
                  all arrangements; he has good taste and will make it a success. Nina Rivers gives
                  a party to-morrow night. Eugene is going. He told me last evening that he had been
                  corresponding with her for a long time. I wonder what mother would think if she
                  knew that I Eugene is a great flirt, and I would laugh if he were caught at last.
                  Nina, at one time, was a special favorite of his, and she is prettier now than she
                  used to be. I would be very glad to find it true, for perhaps then I would have
                  some peace, and my ambitious mamma would cease her scheming."</p>
               <p>"Why did Cora's heart so suddenly stand still, at Estella' s words? What was it to
                  her where he went or whom he loved? He was only her friend, she reasoned,<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6609-00000023"/> and what else was she to expect? Oh, why
                  did her heart beat so painfully—did she love him?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Cora! what is the matter? You are as pale as a ghost," said Estella.</p>
               <p>"I do not feel well," said she, turning away, for fear Estella's eyes would read
                  the truth.</p>
               <p>"Stay with me to-night, please."</p>
               <p>Cora complied with her request, and under the cover of darkness hid from her the
                  truth that was gnawing at her heart; but far into the night, while Estella thought
                  her asleep, she lay there by her side, battling with the feeling her words had
                  awakened.</p>

               <p>"MAY I come in, doctor?" asked Cora, opening the library door.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, snowdrop. I thought you had gone out with Eugene and Estella. Are you
                  not interested in the party, too?</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, but I preferred staying at home to-day. I have; just received a letter
                  from father. He is in Rome, and thinks of returning soon," said she, sitting down
                  on an ottoman at his feet.</p>
               <p>"And take you away, my sunshine! I am almost selfish enough to wish that he would
                  prolong his stay. How the sight of your face carries me back to the past, when
                  your mother, father and I, were playmates. You are very much like your mother,
                  Cora. You have the same brown curls and blue eyes, the same loving disposition.
                  She was a great favorite with us all—we went to her to settle our disputes. Your
                  father was a great, handsome fellow, then, and boy-like, we were fierce rivals. I
                  went away to study a profession, at last, and while I was gone, Hugh carried off
                  the prize. There is the office bell! I am sorry to leave you, Cora, but a doctor
                  has never a minute to call his own. On the table are some books I bought to-day.
                  Look at them; perhaps they will interest you."</p>
               <p>Cora did not look at the books, but she bowed her head on her hands and murmured,
                  "Oh, if I were only in my own home! I could forget him then; but it is so hard
                  here! He was so cruel!—no, not cruel either, for he was not to blame. He has only
                  asked for friendship, and I have given him love! What would he think of me, if he
                  knew it?" and she resolved to conquer her love—yes, if it killed her!</p>
               <p>"Cora,"</p>
               <p>That word called her to her senses; she dashed away her tears and sprang to her
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"Cora! where are you? My dress has just been sent home—come and see it."</p>
               <p>"I never saw you so animated. What has come over you?"</p>
               <p>"You are surprised. I am a Brainard most of the time, to-day, a Tracy—caught the
                  spirit, perhaps!" said<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6609-00000024"/> she, laughing.
                  "Mother is anxious that I shall look exceedingly well, to-morrow night, you know
                  for what purpose. Eugene would be amused if he knew it; but look at my dress, is
                  it not beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"Very; that shade of blue suits your complexion so well."</p>
               <p>"You don't know what you have missed by not coming with us, Miss Cora," said
                  Eugene, meeting her as she came from Estella's room. Then catching sight of her
                  tear-stained face, he exclaimed, "You have been crying!"</p>
               <p>"Have you received bad news from your father?" asked Estella.</p>
               <p>"No." And she hastily left the room for fear he would read her thoughts.</p>
               <p>The night for the party came, and very beautiful did Estella look in heavy blue
                  corded silk, with folds of misty lace covering the gleaming white of her fair
                  shoulders. She wore no ornaments; only a bunch of pink rose-buds caught the lace
                  on her bosom. Her rounded arms were bare, and almost as white as the gloves she
                  wore. Her hair was braided simply and wound around her head in a way that showed
                  well her classic brow. She looked a queen as she stood there receiving her guests,
                  in her quiet, stately way.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainad standing in the door, richly attired in pale, green silk, her dark
                  hair looped up with scarlet berries, thought Eugene could not fail to be impressed
                  with Estella's beauty, nor would he prefer that silly chit over there, thought
                  she, glancing contemptuously at Cora, who wore only a plain, white cashmere dress,
                  a bunch of purple violets that nestled among her brown curls, and a tiny boquet on
                  her bosom.</p>
               <p>"Well, aunt, what do you find so interesting in Cora? You have been watching her
                  for the last five minutes," said Eugene, touching her shoulder:</p>
               <p>"I was only wondering," she replied, "why Cora is so different from Estella. See
                  how awkward she looks, and how she blushes, talking to Mr. Lingle."</p>
               <p>"Do you think her awkward? I am surprised. She is perfectly charming when she
                  blushes. Men think that woman's greatest charm; the poets have celebrated it in
                  verse."</p>
               <p>"Trash!"</p>
               <p>"Who, the poets? Ah aunt, I see you feel disposed to contradict me, so I will go
                  and relieve Cora from that gentleman's attentions, and ask her to sing."</p>
               <p>"What impudence!" she thought when he had left her. "If it were not for insulting
                  her father, she should not stay another hour in this house!"</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Lingle, but we want Cora to sing," said Eugene, offering her his
                  arm.</p>
               <p>She took it with a look of relief, but said, "I cannot sing, indeed I cannot,
                  before all this company."</p>
               <p>"Not even to please me?" said he, looking down into her face.</p>
               <p>She turned away her face from his burning gaze, but did not reply.</p>
               <p>"Come sing the piece you did for me the first day that I met you."</p>
               <p>After the first few notes, a hush fell over them all; you could have heard a pin
                  drop in any part of the room. Loud and clear the song rang out and then died away
                  in low, passionate wails that filled their eyes with tears, so<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000025"/> suggestive were they of loved faces hid forever
                  under the sod—dead hopes that had burned down to cold, white ashes, never more to
                  be revived—broken friendships long since forgotten—blighted loves that have
                  trailed their heart-strings low in the dust. The song was ended, she arose from
                  the piano, while compliments rained upon her from all sides. Blushing under the
                  smile Eugene gave her, she went out and hid herself among the flowers in the
                  conservatory. "Does he love me?" she murmured to herself, and as if in response,
                  came the tender voice—"Cora."</p>
               <p>She was startled, but turned not away; she knew whose voice if was, and her fair
                  face only bent lower over the blooming fuschia.</p>
               <p>"Cora," he repeated, "you know why I have sought you here," and the two white,
                  hands were imprisoned in one of his own, while the other drew her toward him. "I
                  love you! Can I, dare I hope it will be returned?"</p>
               <p>She did not question if he loved another. Estella, her warning, the world, all
                  were forgotten. She did not answer, but lower and lower sank her head until it
                  rested on his shoulder—rested there in perfect faith, confidence and love.</p>
               <p>Eugene Tracy was intoxicated with delight—he folded his arms around the slender
                  form, and kissed passionately the coral, quivering mouth. It was so sweet, so
                  consoling to his vanity, that she, so young, so pure, had given him her heart's
                  first love, and for the time he tried to persuade himself that he was in
                  earnest.</p>
               <p>Some one struck up a wild, gay waltz. It brought Gora out of her world of bliss.
                  She sprang from his arms, and like a frightened deer rushed from his presence
                  ence, never stopping until she had gained her own room and locked the door behind
                  her. Then she threw herself in a chair, and, foolish girl, cried for pure joy.</p>
               <p>Eugene remained where she had left him a few minutes, smiling to himself and
                  softly stroking his mustache, then went out and joined Estella.</p>
               <p>"I have hardly had a chance to speak to you this evening, my cousin. You are
                  looking well. How many hearts have you won, how many broken?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I did not consider any hearts here worth breaking or winning."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I am afraid the youth, beauty, and wit gathered here have been but poorly
                  appreciated. You have queened it right royally, though. By the way, what has
                  become of your friend Cora?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know, I have not seen her since she sang for us. There! some one is
                  calling me. Excuse me, please."</p>
               <p>Eugene took a card from his pocket, wrote a few words on it, then went out in the
                  hall, and gave it to a servant to take to Cora's room.</p>
               <p>Cora hastily wiped away her tears as some one knocked at the door. She opened it,
                  took the card and read: "Come down immediately; I have good reason for it."</p>
               <p>"Can I go?" she asked herself. "Can they read the secret in my face?" She walked
                  down the stairs, her heart almost failing her as she came into the lighted
                  hall.</p>
               <p>Eugene met her at the parlor door, and taking her arm in his own, said, "I thought
                  it best to tell you to come down, for my aunt wants me to marry Estella, and if
                  she missed you, she might suspect my designs and treat you unkindly. You see I
                  have thought only of you, I care<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6609-00000026"/> naught
                  for myself, and for your sake it will be better to keep it a secret until your
                  father's return. You do not care?"</p>
               <p>"No, not as long as you desire it," said she, looking up fondly into his face.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my pet. Let me introduce you to Gerald Lingle; he is a young lawyer,
                  but not at all like his father," and he swept her away in the crowd.</p>
               <p>It was far into the night, the guests had all departed, and all was as quiet as
                  the dead. Up in her room on a rug before the grate, sat Cora, her fair, dimpled
                  cheek resting on her hand, and the dove-like eyes were gazing at the glowing
                  anthracite as if conjuring up some beautiful picture of the future. She was very
                  happy; her heart beat tumultuously, as she thought of his kiss, of his words of
                  love. He was so good, so noble, she thought, and he had honored her with his love.
                  Oh! she could never be grateful enough for it all. Yesterday she was so miserable,
                  and to-night there was such a bright transformation that she almost doubted its
                  reality.</p>
               <p>One, two, three, silvery strokes from the clock in the room below. She started up,
                  half surprised at the lateness of the hour, and going to the mirror, brushed out
                  the soft, brown curls. "If Estella could see me now," said she, smiling to
                  herself, "she would have no cause to speak of my pale cheeks. Oh love, love, what
                  a wonderful invigorator thou art!"</p>
               <p>She hastily disrobed, stopping to kiss the card she drew from her pocket, with its
                  few penciled words; then laid her head upon the pillow, her mind full of happy
                  thoughts.</p>
               <p>Silly, you think her? Ah yes! but then it is a glorious thing to be silly
                  sometimes. You who have grown old and weary, scorched with the noontide sun that
                  beats over your rugged pathway, smile scornfully at this; but smile as you may,
                  you can look back on the past years, and see yourself not as you are now, but fair
                  and young, your heart beating with ardent hopes, your brain filled with the
                  consciousness of your first love! Were they not happy days? No fancied Eden was
                  ever fairer in your eyes.</p>
               <p>Cora descended somewhat reluctantly to her late breakfast the next morning, and
                  her heart sank as she entered the room. Eugene gave her a frigid good-morning;
                  Mrs. Brainard looked at her sharply, and Estella scarcely noticed her at all. The
                  doctor was the only one who was cordial in his greeting. They had often met her
                  before in this manner, but it had not troubled her; but now she felt as if they
                  knew all, and were silent toward her on that account. She sat down to the table,
                  but scarcely touched anything.</p>
               <p>Eugene looked at her, and laughingly said, "Late hours do not agree with you, Miss
                  Cora."</p>
               <p>"What is the matter now, Cora?" asked the doctor.</p>
               <p>"No appetite? You did not rise early enough. Staying up late at night is bad."</p>
               <p>"Eugene, will you drive us to school this morning? It is very late, and I am
                  afraid some of our classes will have recited," said Estella.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, cousin. Like the knights of old, I am always at the service of the
                  fair."</p>
               <p>"You will soon be through school; then what do you propose to do—travel?" asked
                  Eugene, of Estella, as they drove along.</p>
               <p>"Iwould like to, but will no doubt sacrifice myself on<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000027"/> the altar of mammon as my mother has before me. A
                  woman's chief aim is supposed to be, a rich husband, a brown stone front, in fact,
                  all wherewith to make a fashable show, and shall I prove an exception to the
                  rule?"</p>
               <p>"Well, such a life would not make you unhappy."</p>
               <p>A strange smile passed over her face, a smile he could not fathom. He did not know
                  that under the cold, calm exterior there glowed a heart, that out of its
                  immeasureable depths there came a longing that all the fashionable world could not
                  satisfy. Like Maud Muller, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-3">"a vague unrest</l>
                        <l>And a nameless longing filled her breast,</l>
                        <l>A wish she hardly dared to own</l>
                        <l>For something better than she had known."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>She was no enthusiast. Hers was a nature patient, persevering and exacting. She
                  never rushed wildly into anything; cool deliberation marked every action. She
                  could live on independent of any one or any thing, but she would not be happy.</p>
               <p>"Well, here we are at the seminary," said Eugene, and then as he lifted Cora out
                  of the buggy, softly pressed her hand, and whispered in her ear, "Good bye, my
                  darling."</p>
               <p>The hypocrite! Did he think of the fond hopes he was blighting? One would have
                  thought, at least, that he did not care, had they seen the amused look on his face
                  as he drove away.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the house, he lounged into the room where his aunt was sitting,
                  reading.</p>
               <p>"May I smoke?" he asked, taking a cigar from his pocket.</p>
               <p>"Certainly," then closing her book, she looked at Eugene and said, "I half suspect
                  you made love to Cora, last night."</p>
               <p>"Well, what if I did?" asked he, insolently.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, only I would say, be careful. Mr. Benoir is not a man to be trifled
                  with."</p>
               <p>Eugene took the cigar from his mouth, and laughed softly. "Aunt, you are too ready
                  to jump at conclusions. Why can I not admire Cora without loving her? I am not so
                  susceptible as to fall in love with every pretty face I meet."</p>
               <p>"Don't do any thing you will have cause to regret, then."</p>
               <p>"My life itself is one long regret," said he ruefully.</p>
               <p>"I am surprised. I thought one must have a conscience, to regret. You, I supposed,
                  had parted long ago with any thing so troublesome."</p>
               <p>"Now aunt, don't go to sermonizing, for Estella does enough of that, and I am no
                  logician."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said she, mildly. "May I ask if you enjoyed the party last
                  night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," then after a time, "Has not Gerald Lingle been admitted to the bar?" he
                  asked, lazily puffing his cigar.</p>
               <p>"Yes, three or four years ago. He is said now to be a very talented lawyer. Did
                  you notice how attentive he was to Cora last night? I suppose he is well aware of
                  the handsome fortune she posesses."</p>
               <p>"Do you think that the attraction?" he asked, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Certainly. It could not be her face. She is anything but a beauty."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6609-00000028"/>
               <p>"How jealous you women are of each other!"</p>
               <p>"Jealous?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I never knew a woman but could find some blemish in another, even were she
                  as beautiful as Venus, or as graceful as Hebe."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken. I would not wish to pluck one leaf from her crown."</p>
               <p>"Well, aunt, you always knew I was a graceless scamp, so it is not worth while to
                  mind me. Heigho! Eleven o'clock. I have an engagement at that hour. Pray excuse
                  me." Taking up his hat, he commenced whistling and left the room.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he speaks the truth for once, when he says he is a graceless scamp. He has
                  respect for neither youth nor age. If it were not for his fortune, he should not
                  trouble me long," said she, half aloud.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" asked the doctor, kindly, as he entered the room, stood by
                  his wife's chair, and looked down into the face that had an ugly frown on the
                  broad forehead.</p>
               <p>"Nothing that concerns you, sir!" was the haughty reply.</p>
               <p>He took no notice of the tone in which this was said, but asked, "Is it nothing
                  that I can help?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing that you can help," and she arose from her chair, to leave the room, a
                  weary look on her face, as if she wished to escape his presence.</p>
               <p>"Stay one moment," said he as she reached the door, "I have something to say to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"She stopped, her brow contracting, and said, half impatiently, half angrily,
                  "Well."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid Eugene has made Cora believe he loves her I know not if he is in
                  earnest, but even if he were, Hugh Benoir would never wish his daughter to marry
                  such a man, and as she has been left in our care, I wish you would see that he
                  carries this on no further."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid the mischief is already done, for Cora, I think, loves him. I see
                  only one alternative, and that is, to send her away."</p>
               <p>"I could not do it, even if I felt so disposed. If that is your opinion, I have
                  nothing more to say," said he, leaving the room.</p>

               <p>THE soft breezes of the Sunny South swept through the room, playing with the lace
                  curtains, and now and then lifting the invalid's dark hair gently from her burning
                  brow, as she lay on a couch by the low open window. Blanch Wardleigh was dying.
                  For the last two weeks she had seemed more like her old self, but she suddenly
                  grew worse, and had passed a sleepless night. On summoning the doctor, he looked
                  at her a moment, and then said, "She has but a few hours to live."</p>
               <p>"Shall I send for my parents?" Grant asked.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6609-00000029"/>
               <p>"It would do no good, they could not get here before the end. I will leave you a
                  cordial to give her whenever she grows faint. I will come in again, but will not
                  remain with you, for you will want no stranger to look on her last hours."</p>
               <p>Grant sat down by his sister, to await the "grim messenger." She looked like one
                  dead—her eyes were sunken, her lips and cheeks colorless, and her hands almost
                  transparent. She had changed greatly in the last few weeks. One could hardly have
                  recognized in the wreck that lay there, the Blanch of other days. Grant looked at
                  her sorrowfully as he clasped her frail hands. It was so hard to have his last-his
                  only sister, die.</p>
               <p>"Grant," said she, turning her large, dark, restless eyes toward him, "What did
                  the doctor tell you?"</p>
               <p>"He told me, little sister, that you have but a few hours to live," said he,
                  kissing her brow tenderly. "Are you afraid to go?"</p>
               <p>"No, Grant, but if I could only see mother and father, it would take away half the
                  pain of dying. I had hoped I could breathe my last in the dear old home where I
                  first opened my eyes. After I am dead, take me back, let me rest beside Grace in
                  the old church-yard. Grant, please raise me a little on my pillow, my breath is so
                  short, and I have much to say to you before I go. How glad I am, my darling
                  brother, that you are with me," said she, her voice dying away almost inaudibly,
                  and her dark eyes closing.</p>
               <p>He gave her a spoonful of the cordial, and then gently fanned her until she
                  revived.</p>
               <p>"Shall I call the nurse?" he asked when she opened her eyes.</p>
               <p>"No, I want no One but you. Get a sheet of paper and a pencil, I want to give all
                  my friends something."</p>
               <p>"Now, I want to talk about Cora Benoir," said she, after Grant had written down
                  what she desired. "Her last letter lies in that drawer. I was too weak to answer
                  it, you must do it for me, Grant. Tell her how I died; that I thought of her in my
                  last hours, and send her my Bible; tell her to read it sometimes for my sake. Poor
                  Cora, her life is full of sorrow, and I am afraid she forgets God sometimes. I
                  trust that you may meet her, for I know that you would love her. Tell father and
                  mother it was so hard to die away from them, and that it would have been sweet to
                  have lived for their sake; but tell them not to grieve for me, for it will not be
                  long until we meet again. You, my brother, have perhaps a long life before you,
                  and oh! live to do good. Be kind to the poor in our little village;, and Grant, be
                  not only true to yourself, but to your God, so that when you are called to cross
                  the dark river of death, you will not be afraid."</p>
               <p>He raised her in his arms, laid her head upon his breast. "Rest here, my sister,"
                  said he in a broken voice.</p>
               <p>She looked up in his face with a grateful smile; then closed her eyes and was
                  silent.</p>
               <p>One, two, three hours dragged slowly by. The doctor came, laid his hand on her
                  brow, on which the death-damp was already gathering "Poor child! you will not
                  suffer much longer," said he, when she begged them to place her by the open
                  window.</p>
               <p>"The air is so hot, it stifles me," she whispered.</p>
               <p>"It is not warm, my sister."</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6609-00000030"/>
               <p>"Then this is death, my brother?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is death, Blanch."</p>
               <p>She spoke no more after that, but lay quietly in his arms, while he fanned
                  her.</p>
               <p>Night settled over the city, but still she lay in his arms. Toward midnight a
                  violent paroxysm of coughing seized her, and she fell back in his arms with a
                  shiver—dead.</p>
               <p>He laid her gently on the bed, called the nurse, and then went out into the night
                  and paced up and down the long hotel verandah, with bowed head and tears running
                  down his face. He had seen Grace die, but this was his youngest, his pet sister.
                  It was so terrible to be left alone, to see her who but a short time ago was so
                  full of life, suddenly wither and die as a flower. How could he tell his parents
                  that she was dead? But it must be done, and taking his hat, he went into the
                  office and sent the message that in a short time would sadden the little household
                  her presence had brightened.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The morning sun arose from behind the trees, danced over hill and valley, darted
                  through the half closed shutters of the great white house on the hill, and rested
                  for a moment on the marble face of the dead Later, it threw its beams over the
                  group gathered around the grave in the old church-yard, where Blanch Wardleigh was
                  to sleep until time "should Be no longer." The minister who had watched her
                  youthful feet from going astray; the class that she Sabbath after Sabbath had
                  instructed; the poor that she with her bounty had helped; the stricken parents;
                  the bereaved brother—all were there to pay a last tribute to their loved dead. Ah!
                  the sun in all its course looked down on no sadder sight.</p>
               <p>Sorrowfully the group wended their way homeward. The mother looked upon her son,
                  and prayed that God in his infinite mercy would spare her last, her only
                  child.</p>
               <p>He must have divined her thoughts, for he looked down in her face, and drawing her
                  arm tenderly within his own, said, "I will try and fill their place, mother."</p>
               <p>"Grant, have you answered Cora Benoir's letter?" asked Mrs. Wardleigh, a few days
                  after the funeral.</p>
               <p>"No, but I was just thinking of doing so."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it will be best not to delay it longer, for she may feel anxious about
                  Blanch. She little thinks Blanch is in her grave. How they loved each other! never
                  did I receive a letter but it mentioned her name. I hope that I may meet Miss
                  Benoir, some day; I should like to thank her for her kindness to my poor
                  child."</p>
               <p>Grant went to his room and wrote to Cora, told her of Blanch's death; of her
                  words, and the Bible she had left her; then of his mother" and the interest she
                  had taken in her, and then thanked her for what she had been to his sister. It was
                  a painful task, and he gave a sigh of relief as he folded his letter, directed and
                  sealed the Bible, and sent them to the office.</p>

               <p>"What is the matter?" asked Mrs. Brainard, coming into the library and finding
                  Cora crying.</p>
               <p>"Blanch Wardleigh is dead."</p>
               <p>"Who is Blanch Wardleigh?—oh I remember now—one of your school-mates."</p>
               <p>"What were you saying?" Estella asked as she came into the room.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6609-00000031"/>
               <p>"Blanch Wardleigh is dead," replied her mother.</p>
               <p>"Oh Cora! when did she die?" she asked, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"At midnight, "on the first of the month I have just received a letter from her
                  brother; read it."</p>
               <p>Estella read the letter through, but not a feature moved, not a tear stole down
                  her cheek. She rested her face on her hand, and gazed out of the window, with the
                  least tinge of sadness in her eyes.</p>
               <p>Eugene Tracy entered the room; stood by her chair, but she did not heed him, so
                  wrapped was she in her thoughts.</p>
               <p>"What has come over the spirit of your dream,' fair lady?"</p>
               <p>She turned quickly, her face showing how unwelcome his presence was, but said,
                  "Cora has just received a letter from Grant Wardleigh. Blanch is dead," then arose
                  and left the room.</p>
               <p>"Cora, may I come in," she asked a minute after, tapping at her door.</p>
               <p>Cora opened the door, her eyes red with weeping.</p>
               <p>She handed her back the letter, put her arms around her, kissed her, and then left
                  the room, and Cora knew that she had her sympathy, silent though the demonstration
                  had been.</p>
               <p>"Where is Cora?" asked the doctor of his wife, coming into the room where she sat
                  that evening.</p>
               <p>"In her room. She has heard that one of her schoolmates is dead, and she feels
                  very badly about it."</p>
               <p>"I have just received a letter from her father, he will be home soon. He has found
                  a daughter of an old friend, in France. She is living with an old auut, who is
                  very infirm; she cannot live much longer, and when she dies, this little French
                  girl, Minnie Heath—I believe that is what he calls her—will have no protector, so
                  he is going to bring her home with him."</p>
               <p>"Has Miss Heath a fortune?"</p>
               <p>"He did not say."</p>
               <p>"Did Mr. Benoir say when he would sail for home?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, in three weeks."</p>
               <p>"Thank goodness! I will soon be rid of the puritan, "said 'she to herself, then
                  aloud, "I don't think it necessary to speak to Eugene in regard to Cora, for you
                  know she will soon be under her father's care, and rest assured, he will have no
                  opportunity of seeing her then."</p>
               <p>"I will do as you say. God knows I have tried to do my duty! but I fear I have
                  miserably failed."</p>
               <p>"What an ado you make about nothing? His flirting will not kill her. She may
                  suffer severely for a time, but she will get over it."</p>
               <p>"I will never forgive Eugene, if I find he has deceived her."</p>
               <p>"She ought not to have been so silly as to have be lieved him."</p>
               <p>"How did she know he was untrue? He is an adept in hiding his faults."</p>
               <p>"You could not be more concerned if she were your own daughter," said she,
                  warmly.</p>
               <p>"You must remember she is the only child of the dearest friend I have on earth,
                  and her happiness does concern me almost as much as if she were my own
                  daughter."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, had you said she was dearer to you for the mother's sake, rather than
                  the father's, it would have been nearer the truth," said she, scornfully.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6609-00000032"/>
               <p>"My friendship for her was such that it could not hurt either you or I, and you
                  know it."</p>
               <p>"There are a great many things I ought to know, that I do not," said she,
                  spitefully.</p>
               <p>He did not reply, but gazed down into the fire. Who could blame him, if a vision
                  came before his mind of a face exceedingly fair, with mild blue eyes and soft
                  brown curls, a face that had smiled upon him in his boyhood, but that now was laid
                  to rest beneath the sod. Ah! did she who sat opposite, think of the grief she had
                  caused the noble heart that had always been loyal to her? She had it in her power
                  to make his life a happy or an unhappy one, but she had chosen the latter—had
                  caused lines of care to settle on his brow, and his hair to whiten ere its
                  time.</p>
               <p>"Guess what I have to tell you?" said Mrs. Brainard, when Eugene came in that
                  evening.</p>
               <p>"Tell me at once, I never could guess."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Benoir will sail for home in three weeks, so you see your little flirtation
                  is almost at an end, and if you are wise, you will drop it just where it is."</p>
               <p>"Please excuse me from discussing this theme; it is worn threadbare," and he left
                  the room.</p>
               <p>"Benoir is coming home," said he, as he walked slowly down the street. "Of course
                  she will want to tell her father, and that will never do. Fudge! I have played my
                  game until I am tired of it. I marry her? how ridiculous! Believe I will leave
                  here. I have been wanting to go to South America for some time, and as Frank Hale
                  is going next week, I will join him. I hope Cora will have the good sense not to
                  make a scene about it, when I tell her."</p>
               <p>"Cora, "said Eugene, going into the conservatory where she was training a spray of
                  ivy over the window, "I am going to South America. I leave here to-morrow to join
                  my party."</p>
               <p>The spray of ivy fell from her hands, and she turned as if to question him, her
                  face white with pain.</p>
               <p>"Don't look at me in that way!" he exclaimed. "I would have spared you this if I
                  could, but my aunt gave me to understand, last night, that your father would not
                  allow me to marry you. He will be home soon, and could I bear to remain here
                  without seeing you? No, no, Cora, it would make us both miserable, and I have
                  concluded to go away so that you may forget me. Only speak one word—say that you
                  forgive me."</p>
               <p>She saw him now as he really was; saw the lie that lay underneath his words. Oh,
                  could it be that her idol had fallen so low, her idol that she had worshipped as
                  devotedly as the Pagan his clay image. Ah! the wheels of Juggernaut never crushed
                  its victim more cruelly than his words crushed her. For a moment she looked at
                  him, then said, calmly, "Forgive you—ye;—and in a short time I shall forget you,
                  for you are not worth remembering; but there is One that will not forget or
                  forgive you," and she walked proudly out of the room, leaving him astonished and
                  ashamed.</p>
               <p>"She has more spirit than I gave her credit for," said he, stroking his mustache,
                  with a perplexed look on his face. "Well, it is no use to worry about it, but I
                  trust she will not look in that injured way at dinner."</p>
               <p>Cora had too much pride to betray her feelings, and at dinner she met him him
                  cordially, and with as much case as if it had been Estella. None knew the
                     struggle<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6609-00000033"/> that was going on in her
                  heart, nor of the sorrow over her fallen idol. "Ah!" she thought, "I could have
                  looked upon his dead face with less grief, for then my faith would have remained
                  unbroken, but he who I thought so true has fallen, fallen! oh, so low that I can
                  have no pity, only contempt."</p>
               <p>How that day passed she could never tell, but she felt that night when she looked
                  back on the hours of torture, that she had been in a torment more terrible than
                  all Dante's imaginings. There was no milder way of expressing the agony of the
                  time. She had learned the bitter lesson that the world was not so fair nor friends
                  so true as she had pictured them, and she shuddered as she thought of the darkness
                  and loneliness of the future, for where maturity sees hope shining through the
                  clouds, youth sees only despair.</p>
               <p>The first thing that met Cora's gaze the next morning as she descended the stairs,
                  was Eugene's trunks, ready strapped for his departure. In spite of the contempt
                  she felt for him her heart gave a great throb, and she clasped her hands tightly
                  over her eyes, as if that would stay the thought that he was going away, going
                  away from her forever!</p>
               <p>"Are you going to faint?" asked Estella from the head of the stairs.</p>
               <p>The words vanished her momentary weakness. She looked up with a slight smile on
                  her face and said, "That, would be an impossibility just now. What would make me
                  faint?"</p>
               <p>"Those trunks."</p>
               <p>"I have seen just as formidable a row of them before."</p>
               <p>"Confess now, that you are ready to cry your eyes out because Eugene is going to
                  leave us—you may as well."</p>
               <p>"I shall not confess anything of the kind."</p>
               <p>"Well, you are a puzzle! I have thought all the while you were very much in love
                  with my cousin."</p>
               <p>"People are very much mistaken sometimes," said Cora, smiling.</p>
               <p>"So they are. Come, let us go to breakfast."</p>
               <p>"Cora gave no outward sign of her sufferings, with the exception of blanched
                  cheeks and lips. The doctor gave a great sigh of relief as he saw her calmly say
                  goodbye to Eugene, and he thought the shaft had not struck so deep after all. But
                  could he have seen her a few minutes after as she lay on the bed in her own room,
                  and have heard the convulsive sobs that shook her, he would have thought
                  differently.</p>
               <p>She arose at last, and pushing back her hair, said "My life commences anew from
                  this hour; the past shall be as a scaled book, and henceforth, though my path be
                  always alone, I shall ever trust myself under the Father's loving hand."</p>
               <p>"Cora, here is a letter from your father—the last one you will get from Europe,"
                  said the doctor, coming into the room where Cora sat reading that evening. "In a
                  little while he will be with us again. I am very glad for your sake Cora, but I
                  shall give you up reluctantly, for I will be so lonely without your bright face.
                  To-day you look wan and pale. What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>For a moment she was tempted to tell him all, then she thought his generous heart
                  had enough to bear. She would not add to his burden, and she answered,</p>
               <p>"Nothing is seriously the matter. I confess I am not in the best of spirits. I
                  wonder what this Minnie Heath<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6609-00000034"/> is like,
                  and if I shall love her as I do Estella," said she, changing the subject. "Father
                  does not say much about her. Perhaps he wishes to surprise me. I imagine she is
                  quite a child, for he calls her a little girl. It will be pleasant to have her
                  with me, I think."</p>
               <p>"Yes, she can be to you as a younger sister."</p>
               <p>"I believe you did not tell me when your father would sail," said the doctor, as
                  he was about leaving the room.</p>
               <p>"On the twenty-second, in the steamer Persia."</p>

               <p>"WELL, Cora, the Persia will arrive to-night. Is that what has given you rosy
                  cheeks and a pleasant smile upon your lips," asked the doctor of Cora, as she sat
                  at the piano, idly drumming on the keys.</p>
               <p>"Is that not enough, doctor? My heart never beat so jubilantly over any thing as
                  it does over his coming home. It has been a long, patient waiting, but my reward
                  is to be great. Oh, doctor, how can I ever thank you for the good you have done my
                  father?" said she, earnestly, with tears in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I did your father no good, it was the trip that has done it."</p>
               <p>"But you recommended it. If it had not been for you I would have selfishly
                  preferred he had stayed."</p>
               <p>"You bravely let him go, though, when you found it was for his good. I trust that
                  you will not soon be separated from him again. You are going down to meet your
                  father to night?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; nothing could keep me away."</p>
               <p>"Be ready to start at ten o'clock, then; I may not see you again before that
                  time," said the doctor, leaving the room.</p>
               <p>"Wear a wrap of some kind, Cora, for it is very chilly out," said the doctor, a
                  little after nine, as he stood before the grate. "Are you not going with us,
                  Estella?"</p>
               <p>"Mother is not well, you know. I will stay and receive Mr. Benoir when he comes.
                  He will remain with us a few days, will he not, father?"</p>
               <p>"I want him to."</p>
               <p>It was a beautiful night, the waves rose and fell glittering in the moonbeams. The
                  white sails of the vessels along the wharf, flapped in the wind and threw ghastly
                  shadows on their decks. Cora walked up and down, her head burning and her heart in
                  a perfect tumult. It seemed hours that she had been looking out on the water.</p>
               <p>"What if the steamer were wrecked, and my father lost?" she asked herself. But
                  just as the question arose in her mind, there was a great shout—the steamer was in
                  sight. Cora almost held her breath, as nearer and nearer it came plowing through
                  the deep, up to the pier. " Oh, if he were only there!"</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Benoir on board?" shouted the doctor.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," responded a gentleman.</p>
               <p>A tide of unspeakable joy welled up from her heart as she heard that familiar
                  voice, and leaning her head on her hand, she thanked God for His goodness.</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6609-00000035"/>
               <p>"Cora!" and in a moment she was clasped in strong arms.</p>
               <p>"Oh, father!" was all she could say.</p>
               <p>"This is my ward, Minnie Heath, my daughter," said Mr. Benoir, turning to a young
                  lady by his side.</p>
               <p>Cora smiled as she kissed her, for she thought of the little girl she had imagined
                  her to be. She was rather below medium height, it was true, but one glance at her
                  face convinced Cora she was but little younger than herself.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Benoir, please see that my trunks are all right, that porter is so stupid,"
                  said Miss Heath.</p>
               <p>"This way, Miss Heath, the carriage is waiting," said Cora, when Mr. Benoir had
                  gone to do her bidding.</p>
               <p>Don't call me Miss Heath, call me Minnie, for I mean to ignore etiquette and call
                  you Cora."</p>
               <p>"That will please me; we are to be sisters, you know. Did you have a pleasant
                  voyage?"</p>
               <p>"Yes and no. I was terribly seasick at first, but after that I had a very pleasant
                  time. I was glad, though, to get on land again."</p>
               <p>"Now for home," said the doctor, taking up the reins.</p>
               <p>"And this is New York, the birth-place of my father," said Minnie to Cora. "I can
                  hardly realize it. Poor father! If he could only have lived to come with me," said
                  she a little sadly, and she sank back in the carriage and relapsed into
                  silence.</p>
               <p>Cora watched her. Her's was a face dark, bright and piquant; black eyes, that even
                  in the moonlight looked as if they could dance with mischief; full red lips; a low
                  forehead with jetty masses of black hair. Altogether, the face was prepossessing,
                  and Cora knew that she should like her.</p>
               <p>"Here we are at home," said the doctor, breaking the silence. "Ladies, are you
                  asleep?"</p>
               <p>"Estella met them at the door, with a look of pleasure on her haughty face. "How
                  glad I am to see that you are looking so well," said she to Mr. Benoir. "And you I
                  shall not meet as a stranger," said she, after she had been introduced to Miss
                  Heath, and stooped and kissed her. Mother told me to present her compliments, but
                  that she was not well enough to see you," said she, leading the way to the
                  parlor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benoir and Dr. Brainard were as jovial as schoolboys; they talked long, and
                  almost forgot the ladies' presence.</p>
               <p>Estella grew impatient. "Cora, there is a possibility of us staying here all
                  night, if we listen to them. It is very late, and we will retire. Miss Heath, I
                  have given you the room adjoining Cora's. Are you ready, Cora?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, as soon as I say good night to father," and she bent over the back of his
                  chair and kissed him.</p>
               <p>"Dear me! I thought I should find everyone so different here from what they are in
                  France," said Minnie, as they were about to retire—for girl-like they had
                  concluded to occupy the same room that night—but the only difference I can see is
                  that at one place they speak English and at the other, French."</p>
               <p>"I was a little surprised to hear you speak such perfect English."</p>
               <p>"I have had an English governess ever since I can remember, and my father was an
                  American, you know.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6609-00000036"/>
               <p>"You all look so sad here," said Minnie, after surveying herself in the glass a
                  minute. The doctor looks sad, and the madamoiselle looks sad, and you look sad.
                  Are you uh happy?</p>
               <p>Not any more so, I suppose, than the most of mortals."</p>
               <p>Minnie hummed a line of a French song that Cora could not understand—then added
                  she was sleepy and would go to bed; and when Cora turned out the gas, she was far
                  in the land of dreams.</p>
               <p>"Father is at home! oh, how much unhappiness that sweeps away," thought Cora, as
                  she laid her head upon the pillow. I would be perfectly happy, if it were not for
                  Eugene. Oh, if he had only been true! Why can I not scorn him as he deserves to be
                  scorned; why can I not crush out this hopeless love? I must rouse myself, must
                  shake off this morbid feeling. I will bring myself to look upon my father as all
                  in all, and it shall compensate for what I have lost. Mother, angel mother! help
                  me, for now your child must share the common lot—the lot of woman—suffering and
                  tears."</p>
               <p>The next morning Mrs. Brainard met her guests with cordiality that was quite
                  unlike her, and no mother could have been more kind and attentive than she was to
                  Cora. To Minnie she was merely polite, for there was something in her black eyes
                  that kept her at a distance.</p>
               <p>"Here, Cora, is your present," said Mr. Benoir, after breakfast, clasping a
                  diamond necklace around her neck, which flashed and scintillated in the
                  sunlight.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, father, Oh, how beautiful!" said she, holding it up.</p>
               <p>"I thought of you, Estella, while in Paris, and bought you a set of amethysts;
                  will you accept them?" said Mr. Benoir.</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," said she, extending her hand for them. "It was kind in you to
                  remember me."</p>
               <p>"Cora, I will have the servants recalled, and we will go home to-day," said Mr.
                  Benoir.</p>
               <p>"Just as you please, father."</p>
               <p>"Not going to leave us to-day? That is too bad! We expected you to stay a week
                  with us, at least, and I have learned myself to look upon Cora as almost a
                  daughter, and it will pain me to have her leave us," said Mrs. Brainard,
                  blandly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, stay a few days with us, Hugh," said the doctor, "you have not rested from
                  your journey yet."</p>
               <p>'Thank you, doctor, but we must go home sometime, and it might as well be to-day.
                  John and his wife are anxious to return, and the sooner I am settled, the better
                  we all shall feel. We do not live far apart, and I Hope to have the pleasure of
                  seeing you often at my house."</p>
               <p>"I don't like the doctor's wife, nor his daughter," said Minnie to Cora, that
                  day.</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"There is a patronizing air about his wife that makes me distrust her, and his
                  daughter is an iceberg; I almost freeze when she is near me. I will be glad when
                  we leave here."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken; Estella though outwardly cold, is not so at heart. Your first
                  impression is wrong."</p>
               <p>"I am a firm believer in first impressions," replied Minnie.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6609-00000037"/>
               <p>"One can not always rely on them, though. I could give you an example from my own
                  life, were it necessary," said Cora, thinking of her first impression of Eugene
                  Tracy."</p>
               <p>"You could not convince me that I am wrong, and a it is unpleasant, we will say no
                  more about it."</p>
               <p>"What a beautiful home yours is," said Minnie, that night, as she wandered through
                  the parlors, library, or wherever fancy dictated. "It reminds me of my own home.
                  Is this your room?" said she, placing her hand on the knob of a door that would
                  not open.</p>
               <p>"No, it is mother's; and it has not been opened since she died. Every thing is
                  just as she left it. Father says it always shall be left so."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said Minnie, when she saw tears in Cora's eyes, "I did not mean so
                  say anything to wound you."</p>
               <p>"Your words did not hurt me, nor did they cause me to think of my mother, for she
                  has been in my thoughts all day. Come with me and I will show you your room. There
                  it is, just opposite my own. You need not sleep there unless you want to, for my
                  room is always open to you. How are you pleased with it?"</p>
               <p>"Very well; the view is beautiful from this window, and the room is light and
                  airy. To-morrow I will hang my pictures here. I have no doubt I shall like New
                  York in a short time, as well as Paris."</p>
               <p>"I hope you will. You must feel lonely in a strange land."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do feel lonely, but I would not wish to go back. France has nothing to
                  draw me to it now, for mother and father are both dead. I wish, though, their
                  graves, were where I could visit them. It was the only pang I felt when leaving
                  there."</p>
               <p>"Did you not leave an aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but she is very distantly related. She was old and out of her mind, and will
                  not miss me, and consequently, I felt no great sorrow in leaving her. I have but
                  few friends in Europe. Father for several years had done little else but travel. I
                  and my governess were most always with him; so you see, we stayed in no place long
                  enough to, make many acquaintances. Such a thing as a confidant I have never had,
                  and I have always been left to follow my own inclinations, so don't be surprised
                  if you find me very naughty."</p>
               <p>"I don't think you are very naughty," said Cora, smiling, as she looked in her
                  bright face.</p>
               <p>"Well, Minnie, are you going to school?" said Mr. Benoir, the next morning at
                  breakfast.</p>
               <p>"I suppose I ought to. Where do you go, Cora?"</p>
               <p>"To Madame De Bruler. She is a French lady, and very kind; you would be sure to
                  like her."</p>
               <p>"Well, if I find myself far enough advanced to go in your classes, I may, but if
                  not, you may expect to see me remain at home. I am not the least ambitious; I love
                  ease above every thing else," said she, lazily balancing her fork on her finger.
                  "I confess I do not like to study."</p>
               <p>"Go with me to-morrow, Minnie, and see how you like it," said Cora.</p>
               <p>Minnie went, and when she found herself much further advanced than Cora, she
                  concluded to finish there. "That is, if I do not have to study too hard," she
                  laughing said to Cora.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6609-00000038"/>
               <p>Minnie became a general favorite at school, both with teachers and scholars; yet
                  she was not perfection, for she was imperious, selfish and hasty. Offend her, and
                  she would pierce you with arrows of sarcasm, and turn haughtily away from your
                  explanations; but perhaps the next moment she would come to you alt tears and
                  forgiveness, and you would find it impossible to resist her pleadings. She was not
                  a diligent student, but her memory was good, and she managed to glide through all
                  with an ease that made the others envious.</p>
               <p>Her nature was naturally sunny; no cloud could long hang over her, though, when
                  she did suffer, it was intense and deep. She was quick tempered, but like a flash
                  of lightning, in moment it had come and gone. The house would have been lonely,
                  and its silence almost unbearable, if it had hot been for her; she was like a
                  stray sunbeam, darting here and there in the most unheard of fashion. Was Mr.
                  Benoir in one of his melancholy moods—she would dance into the library, tear down
                  his books, scatter his papers, or ask him questions until his melancholy had
                  vanished. Was Cora grieving over the past—her mirth-inspiring laughter cheated her
                  of half her sorrow; yet there were times when she would steal away from Minnie's
                  searching gaze, and taking from a drawer a few crumpled notes, would read them
                  over and over again, as if the contents were not already indelibly stamped upon
                  her heart. But one day a new impulse seized her, and lighting a taper, she laid
                  the notes on the marble hearth and touched them with it. In a moment they were in
                  a blaze; the next, there only remained of the old love memory and the white, dead
                  ashes. Then and there, she resolutely banished him from her heart, and although
                  Estella was a frequent visitor at the house, Cora was never known to speak of him.
                  These visits were a source of annoyance to Minnie, for Estella had never won her
                  friendship. There was something impenetrable about Estella, and it fretted Minnie
                  because she could not understand her. To Cora's oft repeated question, "Why do you
                  dislike her?" she would reply "I do not know, but it is so."</p>

               <p>ANOTHER year had passed away, and Madame De. Bruler pronounced the young ladies'
                  education finished The annual reception was given to introduce her pupils-now no
                  longer such—to the fashionable world. Coach es were rolling to and from the door.
                  The sounds of gay music could be heard by the passers-by, and from the large
                  balconied windows of the drawing rooms might be seen group after group of
                  beautiful women and distinguished looking men in the promenade. Every thing was as
                  it should be; the most fastidious could not fail to be satisfied, either as they
                  looked at the tasteful decorations of the rooms, the entertainment, the music or
                  the guests; therefore, knowing this, Madame De Bruler was was delighted and at
                  rest." She moved through her rooms, receiving and entertaining her guests with
                     grace<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6609-00000039"/> and ease. Of the young ladies
                  who were at this season coming out into society, under her auspices, one could
                  hardly tell which of the three, Minnie Heath, Cora Benoir, or Estella Brainard,
                  created the greatest sensation, for all were universally admired. There was the
                  statuesque Estella, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-2">"with stately mien</l>

                        <l>Who moves a grace and looks a queen,</l>
                        <l>All passionless and pure,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and the gay and sparkling Minnie, flitting like a butterfly from flower to
                  flower, and turning the heads of half the youthful Adonises gathered there. But
                  little she cared for their love—she would have trampled their hearts as ruthlessly
                  under her feet as she did the moss-rose buds in the carpet. She sought admiration,
                  and received it to her heart's content, for none failed to praise the bright,
                  laughing face. Cora, though spoken of last, was not least. She had changed much in
                  the last year, had lost her childishness and timidity as she matured into
                  womanhood. Her face was still pale, but when she smiled, it brightened all over,
                  like Moore's Nourmahal. Expression was her chief attraction; the color came and
                  left her cheeks as shadows do in the sunlight. Soul was in all she did. It flashed
                  through her words, mirrored itself in her dove-like eyes, like a blazing mass of
                  pearls, bright and soft. While looking at her, one felt like asking, with the
                  poet, <q>

               <p>Gerald Lingle had been a devoted admirer of Cora, ever since Estella Brainard's
                  birth-day party. To night as he was urging her to sing, Madame De Bruler came up
                  to her, leaning on the arm of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Allow me, my dear Cora," she said, "to introduce Mr. Wardleigh, your once loved
                  school-mate's brother. I have no need to recall Blanch, for I am sure you have not
                  forgotten her."</p>
               <p>A rich flush mounted to Cora's cheeks, and her eyes flashed with pleasure as with
                  a frank expression of joyful greeting she extended her hand.</p>
               <p>Gerald Lingle drew back after he was introduced, for he knew she would wish to be
                  alone with the brother of her dear, dead friend. She understood his kindness, and
                  gave him a smile of thanks.</p>
               <p>"I was hardly prepared to find you a tall, graceful woman, Miss Benoir," said
                  Grant Wardleigh. "From sister's conversation I imagined you to be almost a little
                  girl, and I am afraid I have always thought of you as such."</p>
               <p>"I was but a girl of fifteen when Blanch knew me," she replied.</p>
               <p>After that their conversation drifted to other subjects, and as they swept up and
                  down the promenade, her arm resting on his own, a soft enchanting grace floating
                  around her, he felt, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"As if his soul that moment caught</l>

               <p>She was a woman worth winning, he thought, and he would try for the prize. He
                  spoke to her of his home, of his travels, and of Blanch whose young life was

                  should be friends, "And we will be, will we not," he asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, for I have thought of you as a friend. Blanch spoke of you so often that you
                  could not seem a stranger to me. Do you intend remaining in the city very long,
                  Mr. Wardleigh?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am going to practice law with Judge Glynn. You will allow me to call on
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"I shall be happy to see you at any time."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; but I am afraid you will repent of the answer you have just given me,
                  for I aim a stranger here, and who knows but my office will be found so dreary in
                  the evenings, that I shall take advantage of it, and burden you with my presence
                  frequently."</p>
               <p>"When I repent, you will know it," said Cora, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Who is that young lady talking to Mr. Lingle?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"My father's ward, Minnie Heath. She is full of vivacity and wit. I will introduce
                  you; I know that you will like her. But there is my most intimate friend, and in
                  my opinion the belle of the room," and she pointed to Estella, as she sat with her
                  graceful Grecian head bent slightly forward, her massive golden braids! wound
                  carelessly around it, her chiseled features serenely beautiful, and her hands
                  white as alabaster, resting half clasped.</p>
               <p>Grant Wardleigh looked at her a moment in silence, "then said, "A snow cloud
                  moving serenely through silent air—nothing more."</p>
               <p>"If you knew her as well as I, you would not have said so," remarked Cora.</p>
               <p>"I may be mistaken, but looking at her now, she impresses me as such, and faces
                  are nearly always the indexes of the mind."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Wardleigh, but we want Miss Cora to sing," said Madame De Bruler.
                  "Oblige us this once, my dear."</p>
               <p>Grant offered her his arm, and conducted her to the piano.</p>
               <p>She sang a Spanish song fraught with passion and tears—joy and sorrow commingled,
                  and a silence fell over them all as the clear bird-like voice rang through the
                  room.</p>
               <p>Grant Wardleigh was not a little astonished; he had never heard of her possessing
                  such an exquisite voice.</p>
               <p>Cora arose from the piano, took his proffered arm, blushing slightly at the praise
                  she received from those around her.</p>
               <p>"I am lost in admiration, words of mine can not do you justice," said he, as they
                  moved away. "Your voice is grand, I—</p>
               <p>"There, say no more," said Cora, interrupting him. "You will make me vain."</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid. One can be conscious of their powers without being vain, and
                  yours is not a head that vanity could turn."</p>
               <p>"Take care, you know not how frivolous I may be."</p>
               <p>"My sister knew you better, I think, than any one else. You have changed little,
                  if any since then; I can read it in your pure, open face. You are a true woman, I
                  only wish I could believe all such," said he, with a tender light in his fair
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>That night as Cora stood before the mirror taking the<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000041"/> rose-buds from her hair, the image of Eugene Tracy
                  and Grant Wardleigh floated before her mind; she compared the two, weighed them
                  well in the balance. Ah! how dwarfed, how insignificant he appeared by the side of
                  Grant Wardleigh with his nobleness and truth, for he was truthful, she knew; every
                  word had the ring of true metal. She wondered how she could have been so blind, so
                  easily deceived in those days. "And he is going to call. I am glad; it will be
                  pleasant for Minnie," she argued; But very little Minnie cared for any one; even
                  then she lay back in a luxuriant chair, laughing softly to to think what fools
                  they had been to flutter around her. "Who cares if the moths do get singed?—I
                  don't!" she said to herself.</p>
               <p>Estella's mind was running almost in the same channel with Cora's. She, too, was
                  thinking of Grant Wardleigh. Ever since Cora had laid that letter in her hands,
                  nearly two years ago, she had endowed Grant with all the virtues possible for man
                  to attain—she had thought of him as a man vastly superior to the majority of his
                  sex—and to-night, as she had gazed upon his face, she felt that she had not
                  over-rated his goodness. She knew that deception was no part of his nature. But
                  how he came to be the intimate friend of her cousin Eugene was a mystery to her.
                  Surely no true friendship could grow up between two so totally unlike. Was it
                  possible that he was deceived in him, or was he trying to raise from the ruins a
                  man. It was a useless task, she thought, if he were.</p>
               <p>"Well, Minnie," said Mr. Benoir, the next morning, "I suppose you lost your heart
                  last night, and I may as well think of preparing to give up my guardianship."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed. My heart is All here; not a piece of it gone."</p>
               <p>"You must be hard-hearted, to withstand all the soft glances and tender words that
                  were showered on you last night. I am afraid you are a coquette."</p>
               <p>"Who can blame me? They all know I am Minnie Heath, worth half a million. If it
                  were not for this fact, how many of the gay throng that were gathered there last
                  night would have deigned to notice me? I have seen enough of the world to
                  understand it pretty thoroughly, so let them take care, for I will have no
                  mercy."</p>
               <p>"But there might be some in earnest, some that would love you for yourself
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"We can generaly tell truth from sham; believe me, I would not be so cruel as to
                  intentionally hurt one that was in earnest."</p>
               <p>"What makes you so quiet?" asked she, turning to Cora, who sat with her face
                  resting thoughtfully on her hand. "Thinking of your new suitor? He paid very
                  marked attention to you last night, and Mr. Lingle looked like a
                  thunder-cloud."</p>
               <p>"Who do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wardleigh, of course."</p>
               <p>"My thoughts were far from him. I was listening respectfully to what you were
                  saying, and thinking the butterfly was worth something more than its wings, after
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Now, Cora, that is too bad, to compare me to a butterfly, for crush its wings,
                  and what remains? I am sorry if I have impressed you as such a shallow, worthless
                  being," said Minnie, half hurt at Cora's words.</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6609-00000042"/>
               <p>"Pardon me, Minnie, I was jesting. I know you have a warm, true heart, and so do
                  others, angry?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the least. When will Mr Wardleigh call?"</p>
               <p>"He promised to call this evening."</p>
               <p>"Who is it that is going to call?" asked Mr. Benoir, who for the last few minutes
                  had been engrossed with his newspaper.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wardleigh—attorney at law—late of Bright; on, and now practising with Judge
                  Glynn," said me, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Wardleigh! I had a long talk with him in the Judge's office, yesterday. He is a
                  fine fellow. There, Minnie, is one that I think is honest, why don't you try to
                  win him?"</p>
               <p>Minnie shrugged her shoulders. "You might as well put me into prison at once, as
                  to marry me to such a man. Why, I would be continually shocking him with my
                  hoydenish ways. Leave him to Cora; the admirably."</p>
               <p>"He does suit me," replied Cora, "and I am g has honored me with his
                  friendship."</p>
               <p>"Cora, what shall we do? It is such a beautiful day that it is a shame to stay in
                  the house," said Minnie, after dinner.</p>
               <p>"How would you like to drive out to Greenwood?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing would please me better."</p>
               <p>It was late in the afternoon when they arrived at Greenwood, and walked slowly up
                  the long, shady avenues. "How quietly they sleep," said Cora, as she sat down by a
                  grave to rest. "The shadows of the leaves chasing each other over the marble, are
                  the only symbols of unrest. Oh, the beauty, the wit, the genius that slumber
                  here—slumber so quietly, that none would think they had ever loved, sorrowed or
                  suffered; yet, through what depths of passion and pain, and through what
                  labyrinths of vain endeavor they came—as we all shall come at last—to this! Death
                  could have no terror for me. It would be sweet, I think, to rest peacefully
                  beneath the tender grasses and clinging mosses that will like these creep over our
                  graves, and be oblivious of the world's envy or hate."</p>
               <p>"See how late it is; the sun is quite down," said Minnie, at length.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is time we were returning. Do the cemeteries here resemble those in
                  France?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, only the graves there are more profusely scattered with flowers. What would
                  I not give to have the privilege you have had to-day, of placing a boquet on my
                  mother's grave. I paid Francois, one of our old servants, a large sum to see that
                  my parents' graves were not neglected, but I am afraid he will grow careless by
                  and by. Nothing would pain me more than to go back and find their graves overgrown
                  with weeds."</p>
               <p>"There are two gentlemen in the parlor, to see you," said Jane, the servant, that
                  evening after their return.</p>
               <p>"Did you have any trouble in finding us?" asked Cora, after entering the room. "I
                  forgot to give you my address."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lingle was kind enough to call at the hotel and pilot me here."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lingie said Minnie, turning to him later that evening, "you spoke last night
                  of a picnic soon to be; what about it?"</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6609-00000043"/>
               <p>"All arrangements have been made. We are going Thursday, up the Hudson, on the
                  Harper, and you young ladies are requested to be of our number. The band will be
                  in attendance, and I think we will have a very pleasant time."</p>
               <p>"I am glad there is promise of a little gaiety. I have been coaxing Cora to go to
                  Saratoga this summer, but I am afraid my coaxing won't do any good.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid it won't, Minnie," said she, smiling. "If I go any place, it will be
                  to some little retreat where I can have quiet and rest."</p>
               <p>"The larger the crowd, and the greater the excitement, the better I enjoy myself,"
                  said Minnie.</p>

               <p>THE day for the picnic dawned bright and beautiful, and a merry party gathered on
                  the Harper, under flying colors and the enlivening strains of music. Minnie was in
                  her element, darting here and there, wild, wayward and capricious as an April day,
                  changeable as the summer clouds, and restless as the waves. She was in raptures
                  with the scenery as they sailed up the river, and declared that it excelled la
                  belle France.</p>
               <p>Estella was there, and promenaded the (deck with Grant Wardleigh, and Cora with
                  Gerald Lingle. Minnie nie would stay with no one but was first at one end of the
                  boat and then at the other, seeing all that was to be seen.</p>
               <p>They arrived at their destination at last, a little green hollow on the opposite
                  side of the bank, with tall maples throwing out on the water their long, cool
                  shadows, and the velvety grass making the hills "look green afar."</p>
               <p>"What an abode for a sylvan!" cried Minnie, as she sprang ashore.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful as the home of Undine; one could imagine her feet had pressed this
                  flowery sod," said Cora.</p>
               <p>"Or we might compare it to the Isle of the immortal Calypso," said Estella.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I could live here forever!" said Minnie, gathering her arms full of wild
                  flowers, for <q>

               <p>"She is very complimentary, don't you think?" asked 'Cora of Gerald Lingle, who
                  was walking by her side.</p>
               <p>"No—yes—I beg your pardon, but I have not the least idea of what you were saying,"
                  said he, confused.</p>
               <p>"Dear me! we can not repeat it, so you do not know what you have lost. Tell me
                  what you were thinking of? Something extremely interesting, to make you unmindful

               <p>She turned and looked up in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Minnie was right," said he, in reply to her look. "You must know, Cora, that I
                  love you. Almost from the first time I saw your face, you have been inexpressibly
                  dear to me. It has been the one dream of my life to call you mine. Am I to be
                  disappointed?" he asked, bitterly, when he saw her unmoved.</p>
               <p>"Gerald, my dear friend, I am proud to think you have honored me with your love,
                  but pained when I know that I can never return it, Do not let this esstrange us,
                  for I need your friendship. Believe me, Gerald, if I had known your thoughts, I
                  would have told you how hopeless your dream was, long ago," said she.</p>
               <p>"Answer me one question, Cora; are you engaged to another?"</p>
               <p>"I am not.</p>
               <p>"Then may I not hope that you will love me," said he, holding her hands in an
                  iron-like grasp, while his dark eyes searched her face.</p>
               <p>"No, Gerald, as a dear brother I shall always love you, but the deeper, truer love
                  for which you ask, I can never give. You are not angry?" she asked, looking at,
                  his knitted brow. "I would have prevented it, if I could."</p>
               <p>"No, Cora, I am not angry, but it is so hard to give up all my cherished dreams
                  and hopes; so hard to give up all thought of ever possessing you. My friendship
                  you shall always have, but pardon me if I do not see you for a time I must live
                  down this unrequited love. Come, let us join the rest of the party," arid giving
                  her his arm, they walked up to a group and found Minnie debating where to have
                  dinner.</p>
               <p>"You truants!" cried Minnie, when she saw them. "It is well you have come, or you
                  would have missed your dinner."</p>
               <p>"That would have been a grievious disappointment, for we are Very hungry," said
                  Cora.</p>
               <p>Gerald Lingle left her then, nor did she see him again until they were on the
                  boat, homeward bound. Sunset had fallen upon them as they sailed slowly down the
                  river, and the broad beam? of yellow light shot through the trees, making
                  everything look like carved gold, and bathing in its mellow rays the faces of all.
                  The last solitary beam had melted away, but the clouds overhead became richer and
                  Rosier, and the river a perfect scene of beauty. "Pure as innocence, and smooth as
                  the brow of childhood," it stretched away, tinged by the most glorious colors the
                  eye ever beheld. Long lines of imperial purple, the tenderest azure, broad spaces
                  of gleaming gold and bars of richest crimson, all blended together on the
                  beautiful sheet of quivering water.</p>
               <p>Cora stood leaning on the railing, looking out on the view before her. The sight
                  filled her heart brim full of loveliness, so as even to surcharge her eyes with
                  tears, But all seemed impressed with the beauty and grandeur of the evening, for a
                  sunset on the water awakens the<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6609-00000045"/> most
                  delicious emotions. The majesty of the beauty represses all sound, it awes the
                  soul to silence. Old memories throng upon the heart—memories of earlier, happier
                  days, and of the loved and lost—the lost—that never again shall gladden our
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>Gerald Lingle paced up and down the deck, buried in his own thoughts, his chin
                  almost resting on his breast. He raised his head when he heard Minnie's low
                  musical laugh, and saw her standing by Cora's side, pointing to a bird skimming
                  over the water near them, which glided within the purple shadows and was seen no
                  more.</p>
               <p>"Ah, they are happy!" he thought, "but all my hopes and aspirations, the
                  brightness of the future, the soaring ambition, the romantic day-dream have
                  vanished—vanished like the bird in the gloaming. Angry with her? the dove! I could
                  bless and revere her memory forever I" and he gazed tenderly at the fair face, the
                  mild blue eyes, and the brown curling hair.</p>
               <p>Cora turned around and caught his gaze fixed upon her. She blushed deeply, for she
                  knew how he suffered, and that she was the cause. "If he only can forget me," she
                  murmured to herself.</p>
               <p>"And you did not accept him, Cora?" said Minnie, who had been watching the two,
                  with eagle eyes.</p>
               <p>"Accept who?"</p>
               <p>"Don't pretend so much ignorance; you know who I mean."</p>
               <p>"Cora did not answer, but walked over to the other side of the boat, where Estella
                  was talking to Grant Wardleigh, her usually calm face radiant with smiles. She
                  made way for Cora, as she approached, and said, "You are just in time. Mr.
                  Wardleigh is going to tell about his visit to the Dismal Swamp."</p>
               <p>Twilight had deepened. One by one the stars came out in the sky and the outlines
                  of objects began to intermingle. The trees on the banks were blending, and the
                  spaces beneath their branches becoming black, while the distant waters glimmered
                  dim and dusky. The moon had risen slowly, and rested upon the hilltops like a
                  great watchfire. But no matter how witching the hour, how touching or how
                  beautiful, one can not stay all night mid moonlight and music, and the tired
                  little party arrived at home, bidding a reluctant adieu to the long summer day
                  that had been crowned with pleasure to all—but one.</p>
               <p>"Cora, you are the most provoking girl living," said Minnie, that night, when she
                  failed to draw from Cora what Gerald Lingle had said to her. "I would not have
                  refused to tell you anything of the kind."</p>
               <p>"I would riot have' asked you."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Minnie, and turned half angrily away."</p>
               <p>"Let me loop up your hair, Minnie," said Cora, taking no notice of her anger, "Mr.
                  Trevanor will soon be here."</p>
               <p>"I wish Mr. Trevanor, was in the bottom of the Red Sea! I don't want to see him—I
                  am tired."</p>
               <p>"What did you tell him to call for?"</p>
               <p>"What else could I do? I hate the stiff, prim old bachelor, and would not have him
                  if every hair in his head was strung with diamonds. I am vexed now to" think I
                  gave him my permission to call, but Frank Gray I was standing by. and I wanted to
                  make him jealous."</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6609-00000046"/>
               <p>Such was Minnie's story, but if Cora could have looked into her heart, she would
                  have seen that she was secretly fretting because Gerald Lingle would not make his
                  customary call that evening, and would have seen also what Minnie would not own to
                  herself, that she cared for him in a way that common friendship did not
                  require.</p>
               <p>"What has become of Gerald Lingle?" asked Mr. Benoir, one day. "I have not seen
                  him for a long time. Don't he call here any more?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," said Minnie. "Grant Wardleigh says he has left the city."</p>
               <p>"Why, what is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Ask Cora, she can tell you."</p>
               <p>"But Cora did not tell, or pay any attention to Minnie's words. Mr. Benoir guessed
                  the truth, however, and asked no questions.</p>
               <p>It was three months before Gerald Lingle returned to New York; then he settled
                  down to his law books with a determination that insured success. Cora met him
                  frequently, and his greeting was as kindly as of yore, but he did not call on her.
                  To Minnie he became quite attentive whenever he met her at party or opera, and she
                  laid a number of plans to get him to the house. It was a long time before she
                  succeeded, but after that he was as frequent a caller as Grant Wardleigh himself.
                  Cora thought Gerald was in a fair way to forget: her, and she was glad of it. She
                  knew from Minnie's incessant chattel that she was not indifferent toward him,
                  though she took great pains to convince her otherwise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benoir saw how things were progressing, and said, one day, he would not be
                  surprised if he had two lawyers in his family, yet.</p>
               <p>Minnie and Cora both assured him there was not a particle of danger, but Mr.
                  Benoir wisely shook his head, and said he knew better.</p>
               <p>The days rolled on, "and they were golden ones to Cora. Unconsciously the old idol
                  had been dethroned, and a new one raised instead. A brother she had never had, but
                  Grant Wardleigh was as untiring in his kindness as the most loving of brothers,
                  and she gave him all a sister's affection, she thought, but unawares her feelings
                  had drifted into something deeper than platonic love. She found she had been
                  deceiving herself as time wore on, and that she loved Grant Wardleigh as she had
                  never loved before. Did he love her? He had not said so, in so many words, but
                  every look had spoken volumes. She was content, for she trusted in his honor, and
                  knew that all would come clear by and by.</p>
               <p>"Well, Minnie," said Mr. Benoir, coming into the room one day, where Minnie was
                  sitting, "Guess what news I have for you?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I can never guess."</p>
               <p>"Try."</p>
               <p>"I have lost my fortune."</p>
               <p>"Does my face look as if I were the bearer of bad news?"</p>
               <p>"No, but I did not know what else could concern me."</p>
               <p>"Does not Gerald Lingle concern you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, some little; but what about him?"</p>
               <p>"He is Judge Lingle, now."</p>
               <p>"Only thirty-three years old, and a judge; that is something that does not occur
                  every day?"</p>
               <p>"No, and you may reasonably be proud of him."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6609-00000047"/>
               <p>"Cora," said Minnie, bounding up the stairs, "don't you think Gerald is a
                  judge!"</p>
               <p>"I am very glad for your sake," said Cora, quietly.</p>
               <p>"You say that in a matter-of-fact way. Your father said it was unusual for a man
                  of Gerald's years to be a judge."</p>
               <p>"I know it," said Cora, laughing at her ardor, and looking up from her book,
                  asked, "What would you have me do?"</p>
               <p>"I would not have you do anything, but you do not seem to care that he has been
                  successful."</p>
               <p>"You would not expect me to be as enthusiastic as yourself?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see why you should not be," said she, in a careless manner.</p>
               <p>"Now, Minnie, you do know why. You know you care infinitely more for him than I
                  do."</p>
               <p>"I don't know as I do," said she, pettishly, as she left the room</p>

               <p>ESTELLA was fairly launched on the sea of fashionable life. Night after night
                  found her at party or opera. She was not vain, but she knew she was beautiful and
                  admired mired; and what woman conscious of her power does not love to exercise it?
                  It was Mrs. Brainard's aim to secure her daughter a wealthy husband, and no pains
                  or money was spared in working for the desired goal. The ultimatum of Estella's
                  hopes was a husband, too—not one that possessed wealth alone, but that had all the
                  qualities essential to the making of a true, noble man—one that she could love,
                  and would love her in return. As for Mrs. Brainard, she had none of these
                  "quixotic ideas," as she termed them. Wealth to her was all in all. It allowed
                  tier to lead a fashionable life—what more was needed?</p>
               <p>The winter season had but commenced. Mrs. Garner, one of Mrs. Brainard's "five
                  hundred" friends, was to give a party, that was to eclipse all former ones in
                  brilliancy and expense. Estella and her mother were going, and she went into the
                  library, as was her custom, to kiss her father good night. As she stood. on the
                  threshold, her heart suddenly fell, and something seemed to say, "Do not go; stay
                  with, your father." "How silly I am," she thought and turned away; but in after
                  years she felt that she would have given much of her life if she had obeyed that
                  warning.</p>
               <p>"The party was composed of the most refined and wealthy people in the city, and
                  Estella had, as usual, a group of admirers around her, but there was an
                  undercurrent of sadness, that made itself felt under all the gay exterior, and it
                  was a relief when she arrived at home.</p>
               <p>I locked ray room, Estella before I went away, and you had better do the same when
                  you go out, for I don't believe Bridget is as honest as she might be. I must go<pb
                     n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6609-00000048"/> into the library and get the key. Why did
                  Mrs. Brain" ard start so suddenly back as she entered the room? Was it an unusual
                  sight to see the doctor sitting there so late at night, or was it the closed eyes
                  and the pale face that looked so deathly under the glare of the gas light, that
                  startled her?</p>
               <p>She went close up to him and shook him by the arm. "Come, wake up; it is very
                  late," she said.</p>
               <p>But the watch ticking on the table was the only sound she heard.</p>
               <p>Ah! you may clasp your hands, and call on his name, but he will not answer, for
                  even as you stood in that crowded throng, basking in the smiles of the gay and
                  frivolous, this tired, patient heart was having the only rest it had known for
                  years—far, far beyond all care, all toil—never to know anything but joy,
                  forever.</p>
               <p>Esteila heard her mother's cry and rushed to the room. One glance told her what
                  her heart most dreaded. She stood one moment looking at her father, her face as
                  white as the dress she wore. "Oh, my father, if I had only remained at home! but I
                  left you to die alone! Oh, mother! I never, never can forgive myself." Mrs.
                  Brainard stood mute before his chair, and gazed with something like sadness on
                  that noble face. Did her cruelty come before her mind? Did she think how she had
                  tried him, until his weary burden had snapped asunder the threads of life? Did she
                  realize that it was herself who had caused himin the prime of life to lay before
                  her, a corpse. Perhaps so, but she gave no outward signs of remorse.</p>
               <p>"Esteila, he may not be dead; ring for the servants and send for a physician,
                  immediately; as for myself, I have not strength enough to do anything."</p>
               <p>"It is little use, mother," said she, passing her hand tenderly over his icy face.
                  "See, there is no warmth here."</p>
               <p>A physician came, looked at him and said, "He has been dead for some time. Heart
                  disease, the cause. His death has, in all probability, been hastened by some
                  mental excitement or sorrow."</p>
               <p>Esteila calmly gave orders to the servants, then went to her room, her head
                  throbbing almost to bursting, and all the night paced up and down the room, her
                  white dress rustling on the floor behind her, and the amethysts gleaming on her
                  neck and arms seemed to mock her in in her misery.</p>
               <p>"Oh if I had only remained at home!" she kept crying to herself. "It would have
                  taken away half my grief to have been with him when he died.</p>
               <p>Morning dawned, and through the gray mist gradually beamed the sun. Estella slowly
                  took off her jewels and dress, donned a dark wrapper, and then went down the
                  stairs into the library, and looked once more on the pale face of her father. She
                  shed no tears, she uttered no moan, but despair was written on her beautiful
                  face.</p>
               <p>"Henry," said she, turning to a servant, "go and tell Mr. Benoir what has
                  happened," and she left the room as calmly as she had entered it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benoir found Estella in the deserted parlor, walking up and down, her arms
                  tightly folded across her breast.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Benoir, I am so glad that you have come. I knew no one else to send for,
                  and I know not what to do myself. Will you see that all is done?"</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6609-00000049"/>
               <p>"Gladly, Estella, and will save you all the trouble possible. Can I see your
                  father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," and she led the way to the room in which they had laid him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benoir looked down on the face, that death as yet had not changed, with
                  feelings of intense sorrow. "My poor friend," he said, " I little thought while
                  talking to you yesterday, that I was destined never to see you again alive. Ah,
                  Estella, how uncertain life is!"</p>
               <p>He was a little surprised to see she shed no tears, but the hard look on her face
                  convinced him that she suffered</p>
               <p>"Where is your mother?" he asked. "Will she have any orders for me to
                  execute?"</p>
               <p>"I think not. She will give orders about nothing but her mourning. The dress
                  makers will be sent for; you could do nothing there."</p>
               <p>"Shall I send Cora to you?"</p>
               <p>"Don't be offended, Mr. Benoir, but I would rather be alone. Let her come and see
                  father, though—she loved him dearly."</p>
               <p>"Hannah, tell Estella I wish to see her," said Mrs. Brainard, faintly, holding a
                  viniagrette to her nose. "Oh, how terrible this all is!"</p>
               <p>"What no you want, mother?" asked Estella, standing in the door-way.</p>
               <p>"Have you despatched for Eugene?"</p>
               <p>"No, it would be of no use. He is in Havana, and could not get here. Is that all
                  you wanted?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I declare, she is like a stone," said her mother, after she was gone.</p>
               <p>"Do I want any breakfast? no, no," said she, as Hannah put down a plate of dainty
                  food, "I cannot eat a bite," but in spite of this assertion she managed to finish
                  a broiled bird, and a large slice of toast.</p>
               <p>"Minnie," said Cora, after her father had returned, "Dr. Brainard is dead."</p>
               <p>"Dead! Why, when did he die?"</p>
               <p>"Sometime last night—no one knows at what hour—but when they came home from the
                  party last night, they found him dead in the chair."</p>
               <p>"Does Estella and her mother take it very hard?"</p>
               <p>"Father did not say anything about Mrs. Brainard, but is alarmed about Estella.
                  She has not shed any tears, but goes about like one in a dream."</p>
               <p>"I should think they would feel very remorseful for leaving him to die alone. Mrs.
                  Brainard has always treated him shamefully."</p>
               <p>Cora mourned for the doctor as if he had been some near relative. He had been" as
                  kind and tender to her as a father, and watched her while at his home, with a
                  parent's solicitude. His sufferings were at an end now, and it consoled her to
                  think that no more would harsh words or neglect pain his generous heart. Oh, if
                  his wife had ever loved him, how sorrowful she must feel for every unkind word,
                  and to know-that from the mute lips would never come one word to tell her that she
                  was forgiven.</p>
               <p>"Don't Mrs. Brainard take on?" whispered Minnie to Cora, the next day at the
                  funeral. "I wonder how many crocodile tears she is shedding?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, Minnie," said Cora, reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"Well, you know," persisted Minnie, that 'still water runs deep."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6609-00000050"/>
               <p>"We cannot tell what her feelings are, and we no right to criticise."</p>
               <p>A reproof from Cora always silenced Minnie, and she said no more.</p>
               <p>Society missed the stately Estella for a few weeks, and then she was thought of no
                  more. Her friends offered condolence as etiquette required, then troubled
                  themselves no further. Cora was the only one that really loved her, and she
                  visited her as often as she would allow, for Estella had grown colder and more
                  distant than, and sometimes even refused to see her.</p>

               <p>"WHAT a beautiful spring day this has been," said Cora one evening, as she and
                  Grant sat by the open window.</p>
               <p>"It has been a beautiful day, and it has made me long for my old home. I think I
                  shall go next week."</p>
               <p>"Cora heard this with a touch of pain, for she knew how lonely she would feel
                  after he was gone, "Will you stay long?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I am not very busy now, and I shall probably remain two or three months. There is
                  only one thing, that I shall regret in going, and that is the necessity of being
                  deprived of your society," said he, looking down tenderly into her face.</p>
               <p>"And I shall miss you," said she, softly.</p>
               <p>He took her hands, pressed them gently, and said, "That assurance will shorten my
                  stay. I must go now; it is eleven o'clock," said he, glancing at his watch.</p>
               <p>Grant was gone, and Minnie laughingly declared that Cora acted like one lost.</p>
               <p>"When were you to see Estella last?" asked Minnie one day, of Cora, at dinner.</p>
               <p>"Not since last week."</p>
               <p>"Nina Rivers told me to-day that she and her mother are going to Cape May next
                  week."</p>
               <p>"Going to Cape May! What nonsense!" said Mr. Benoir. "The doctor was very much in
                  debt when he died, and it took half his fortune to liquidate the claims. Still
                  they would have enough to live comfortably, if they would practice a little
                  economy; but I am afraid if Mrs. Brainard keeps on at this rate, she will find
                  herself without anything before long."</p>
               <p>"Minnie, there is something in this letter that will interest you," said Cora,
                  giving her a letter she had just received from Grant, a few days after.</p>
               <p>"Oh how delightful!" said Minnie. "To think we are invited to spend the summer at
                  Grant's home, and such a nice party to go with us."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry Estella has gone to Cape May. She would like to have gone with us, I
                  know," said Cora.</p>
               <p>"I am glad she is not going with us."</p>
               <p>"Minnie, you are selfish."</p>
               <p>"I know it, my mentor; but Estella cares a great deal<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000051"/> for display, and would have no chance of showing
                  her elegant vardrobe there. She likes excitement and a crowd, and I wish that she
                  may have them."</p>
               <p>"I thought that you liked excitement and a crowd? You were lamenting last summer
                  because I would not go to Saratoga with you."</p>
               <p>"I do like a crowd, but quiet and Gerald are more desirable."</p>
               <p>"That is the secret of your delight, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Cora," said Minnie, that night, coming up to her room with a disappointed look on
                  her face," Gerald says he cannot go with us, and that he will be so busy that he
                  cannot come for a month, if then."</p>
               <p>"That is a disappointment, but not so great as if he could not come at all."</p>
               <p>"Beautiful! beautiful!" exclaimed Minnie, as she stood on the verandah of the
                  Wardleigh mansion, and gazed on its extensive grounds, which were profusely
                  scattered with flowers. "Grant, you ought to be as happy as a king here."</p>
               <p>"I am, Miss Minnie."</p>
               <p>"Cora, you do not say a word."</p>
               <p>"I am lost in admiration," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Come ladies," said Grant, turning to the group, I know your journey has made you
                  hungry, and Chloe says tea is waiting. After that, if you are not too tired, we
                  will go over the grounds."</p>
               <p>"And this is Blanch's grave," said Cora to Grant, the next evening, as they were
                  strolling over the old church yard.</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is Blanch's grave—and that is Grace's."</p>
               <p>Then a silence fell between them, for both were busy with their thoughts. "Cora,"
                  said he at last, "it was Blanch's desire that I should meet and love you. Long
                  before I knew you, the letters you had written to my sister had awakened a
                  friendly interest in my heart for you; but when we met, and I found a woman who
                  had lived in the blaze of fashion all her life, and yet had never become
                  contaminated with it, whose heart remained as pure as a child's, I learned to love
                  you. I have not spoken of this before, Cora, because I felt so unworthy of you.
                  Every day I strove to become truer for your sake, and may I hope that your
                  feelings are not indifferent toward me?"</p>
               <p>She was silent.</p>
               <p>"Oh Cora! say that you will love me."</p>
               <p>Still she was silent, but she raised her eyes all eloquent with tears, and Grant
                  read his answer there.</p>
               <p>"My darling! my own precious darling!" said he, drawing her toward him, and
                  pressing his first kiss on her lips. "Oh, if Blanch could only have known
                  this!"</p>
               <p>"Who knows but she does. Her spirit, like that we were reading in the German
                  legend this morning, may be hovering around those she loved."</p>
               <p>"Her face was ever pure and saint-like, and I can almost imagine I see her looking
                  down upon us now."</p>
               <p>"Is not that Minnie and Gerald coming toward us?" asked Cora, as she heard a low
                  silvery laugh.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I thought when I received his letter saying that he could not come until the
                  latter part of the summer, that he could not remain that long from Minnie's
                  side."</p>
               <p>"Grant," said Gerald ass they met, "Don't think I<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000052"/> have been guilty of deception. I wrote to you that
                  I could not come, but I found it so insufferably dull after you all had gone, that
                  I concluded to run down for a few days, anyhow."</p>
               <p>"Miss Cora," said he, turning to her, "the country air seems to have had a
                  powerful effect on you already—your cheeks are as pink as Minnie's boquet of wild
                  roses."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid the country air is not all that has made her cheeks so rosy," said
                  Minnie, looking up laughingly into her face, then noting her embarasment, she
                  changed the subject, by saying she was tired and proposing that they should return
                  to the house.</p>

               <p>A glaring mid summer sun, a long dusty road. Eugene Tracy glanced at both and
                  shrugged his shoulders, as he jumped off the cars at the little wayside station
                  called Brighton.</p>
               <p>"I wonder why Grant is not here to meet me. Nice way to treat an invited guest, 1
                  do think," said he frowning, and muttering something between his teeth.</p>
               <p>"Say, boy," said he suddenly to a little ragged urchin standing near. "How far is
                  the Wardleigh Place from here?"</p>
               <p>"Dun no," said the boy, giving him an idiotic stare.</p>
               <p>"Well, do you know where Grant Wardleigh live, then?" asked he, impatiently,
                  thinking the boy had not understood him at first</p>
               <p>"'Spect I do."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"Now, stranger, what would you give to know?" asked he, leaning against the fence,
                  putting his hands in his pockets, and squinting up his eyes in a way that would
                  have done credit to Sam Weller.</p>
               <p>Eugene Tracy grew enraged. "Are you going to tell me or not?" asked he, shaking
                  him by the arm.</p>
               <p>"Seeing you are so mad, 'spect I'll have to," said the boy as he felt the grasp
                  tighten on his arm. "It is the first white house on this yer road. You can't miss
                  it. Now let go of me; let go of me I tell you!" and he pulled away.</p>
               <p>"Tell me if it is a long walk, first,"</p>
               <p>"It might be longer."</p>
               <p>"That is not answering my question."</p>
               <p>"You old pepper-pod! I won't tell you a nother thing!" said the boy when he found
                  himself free, and picking up a stone he whirled it at him, then scampered off as
                  fast as be could.</p>
               <p>Eugene Tracy walked angrily away. To be compelled to walk on such a day as this
                  was to his mind an insult too great to be borne. But what was he to do? To go back
                  was impossible, for no train would be due until midnight. So he had to swallow his
                  wrath and walk on, which was a disagreeable thing to do—more so from the fact that
                  there were few disagreeable things he had ever been forced to do. Had his life
                  been one less of ease, he might perhaps have been different; as it was he was
                  still the unprincipled man of years before.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6609-00000053"/>
               <p>"Thank fortune, there is the house at last!" said he, stopping to wipe the dust
                  and perspiration from his face, after having traveled along for more than an
                  hour.</p>
               <p>"Catch me ever making such a fool of myself again!"</p>
               <p>At that moment a gleam of a white dress flitted through the trees, and he heard a
                  clear voice singing "Daisy Dean." In a moment more he stood face to face with Cora
                  Benoir.</p>
               <p>He expected tears and reproaches, but instead of that, she came forward, smiling,
                  and held out her hand in a cordial manner. "Mr. Tracy, how glad I am to see you!
                  This is such a pleasant surprise."</p>
               <p>But not so self-possessed was he. A look of shame spread over his face; he stood
                  still, hesitated, and then stammered out that he did not think she had remembered
                  him all these years.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you know one does not so easily forget old friends," said she, softly, laying
                  a little stress on the last word.</p>
               <p>He winced at that, for he knew what a wretch she thought him. She saw his
                  confusion, and laughed somewhat maliciously, he thought, and no doubt he would
                  have turned and left, had not Grant Wardleigh that moment appeared on the
                  'avenue.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! old boy! how are you? What stray cloud have you dropped from?"</p>
               <p>"From a cloud of dust," said he, in a displeased tone.</p>
               <p>"If you had told me when you were coming, I would have met you, and saved you this
                  long, dusty walk."</p>
               <p>"I sent you a letter three days ago."</p>
               <p>"I did not receive it. But never mind, Eugene, I will atone by making your visit
                  as pleasant as possible. I beg pardon, Miss Cora," said Grant, turning to where
                  she stood, "This is my friend and class-mate, Mr. Tracy, Miss Benoir; I was so
                  surprised to see Eugene that I almost forgot you were here."</p>
               <p>"There is no need of an introduction; Mr. Tracy is no stranger to me," said she,
                  pleasantly.</p>
               <p>"You must excuse us now," said Grant, as they ascended the steps of the verandah.
                  "I am going to take Eugene to his room. It lacks but half an hour of dinner," said
                  he, looking at his watch, "and I want him to look well, for remember how many
                  pairs of bright eyes will be flashed upon him."</p>
               <p>"And that reminds me it is time to dress, too, though I do not expect any eyes to
                  flash at me," said Cora.</p>
               <p>Grant laughed, and bending down he whispered something in her ear that made her
                  cheeks like two red roses.</p>
               <p>"So you knew Miss Benoir before you met her today?" said Grant to Eugene, after
                  Cora had left them.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I met her four years ago, while visiting my aunt in New York."</p>
               <p>"This way, Eugene; there is your room. I will leave you now. When you are ready,
                  join me in the library; I want to introduce you to the ladies."</p>
               <p>Eugene closed the door somewhat savagely after his friend, threw his hat on the
                  floor, and walked over to the window, only to catch a glimpse of Cora's bewitching
                  face, as she talked to a lady on the graveled walk. Drawing down the blind, Eugene
                  called himself a fool for being upset at the sight of this woman's face, then sat
                  down in a chair and began cursing the whole sex in general, just as most men do
                  when they find a woman has beaten them; and there is no telling what state of
                     mind<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6609-00000054"/> he might have arrived at, had
                  not the hum of voices below warned him that it was four o'clock. So making a hasty
                  toilet, he descended to the library, where he found Grant Cora; the handsome Judge
                  Lingle, also Minnie Heath Ida Nathan, and Helen Fay. The girls were all very
                  pretty, and stylish enough to attract the attention of one as fastidious as
                  Eugene. But he had eyes for no one except Cora. He could not believe that the
                  elegant woman before him was the Cora he had held in his arms, kissed and
                  caressed, in the days long since gone by. She was no longer a shrinking, blushing
                  girl, but a self-possessed and beautiful woman. He wondered if she remembered the
                  past. He was determined to see. But she understood him better than she did four
                  years before, and when he came over to her side, and the conversation drifted on
                  the past, she adroitly changed the subject, and talked as indifferently as if he
                  had never been in her thoughts. During dinner she directed her conversation
                  chiefly to Grant Wardleigh and Judge Lingle. Eugene Tracy she ignored
                  altogether.</p>
               <p>This was a new, phase in his life, and lie opened his eyes in astonishment, for
                  his wealth never failed before in gaining him attention. But this woman defied him
                  in every way and manner. Should he let her see that he cared? No. And all that
                  afternoon he flirted most desperately with the other ladies. But what satisfaction
                  was there in doing so, when Cora looked on in smiling approbation?</p>
               <p>"Is that Mrs. Brainard's nephew?" asked Minnie, coming up to Cora and whispering
                  in her ear.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I thought so. He is just like Mrs. Brainard. I wonder why he is not with
                  her!"</p>
               <p>"Grant invited him here. He is an old friend and school-mate of his."</p>
               <p>"I am surprised, for he looks dissipated, and Grant has always seemed particular
                  in his choice of friends."</p>
               <p>"Hush! there comes Grant and Miss Fay; he might not like to hear you criticise his
                  friend so harshly."</p>
               <p>"I don't care a fig; Grant understands me."</p>
               <p>"But there is Miss Fay."</p>
               <p>"Well, she ought to have her eyes opened. He was playing the devoted to her to
                  day."</p>
               <p>"What do you know about him, Minnie?" asked she, a little curious.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, only I surmise a great deal; yes a great deal more than you think I do,
                  you sly puss."</p>
               <p>"You are a witch," said Cora, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Something of one," said Minnie, with pretended gravity. "You see you need not
                  keep your secrets from me, for I am sure to find them out.</p>
               <p>"Gerald has been hunting you all over the house, and looks quite disconsolate
                  because he could not find you," said Grant, as he approached her.</p>
               <p>"If that is the case, I must go to him. Where is he?"</p>
               <p>"I left him in the music room."</p>
               <p>"Grant said you wanted me," said Minnie, entering the room, where Gerald was
                  leaning against the window.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was hunting you; where have you been all the evening?"</p>
               <p>"Everywhere almost. This is such a beautiful place, I never get tired of strolling
                  around."</p>
               <p>"Come and sing for me."</p>
               <p>"What shall I sing?"</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6609-00000055"/>
               <p>"Anything."</p>
               <p>Minnie sat down to the piano and sang one of his favorites. After she was through
                  she looked up into his face and saw him gazing at her attentively. "What makes you
                  so quiet?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking of you."</p>
               <p>"Am I such a melancholly subject?"</p>
               <p>"I was thinking whether you could love me."</p>
               <p>"That would depend on circumstances," said Minnie, roguishly.</p>
               <p>"I love you, Minnie."</p>
               <p>"You loved Cora once," said she, not because she doubted his truth, but because
                  she was a little piqued to know he had loved before.</p>
               <p>"I thought I loved her once, and for many, many days I felt very badly because she
                  rejected me; but after I was thrown more in your society, a deeper, warmer feeling
                  sprang up in my heart for you than I ever experienced for Cora."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure you do not love her still?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"As a friend I do, but you are all the world to me. Will you not try to love
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"No, I will not try," then noting the look of sadness that passed over his face,
                  said "for I love you already."</p>
               <p>"Oh Minnie!" and he caught the fingers that were nervously flitting over the.
                  piano keys, in his own, while he pressed a kiss on her blushing cheek.</p>
               <p>"There is that odious Eugene Tracy," said she, trying to free her fingers, as she
                  saw him pass the window and enter the room with Helen Fay. "See, the moon is
                  shining," said she, indifferently;' "let us take a walk."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid we interrupted a very pleasant tete-a-tete, Miss Fay," said
                  Eugene.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the Judge looked as if he had just offered himself."</p>
               <p>"He is becoming quite distinguished in his profession, is he not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and is very popular with the ladies, but pays attention to no one but Minnie
                  and Cora. Report was, once, that he proposed to Cora, and was rejected. How true
                  it was, I cannot say; but he left New York for a time, and after he returned it
                  was long before he visited them. Minnie captivated his fancy, it seems, and drew
                  him there at last, or he imagines that he still has a chance of winning Cora. Let
                  us join Ida on the verandah, for it is so very warm in here."</p>
               <p>"Minnie, what is the matter with you? you, are trying to stick pins into the brush
                  instead of the cushion, and a moment ago you were tearing your glove to pieces,"
                  said Cora, that night, when they had retired to their room.</p>
               <p>"Something has happened," said Minnie.</p>
               <p>"May I ask what it is?" said Cora, because she knew Minnie wanted to tell her.</p>
               <p>"You may guess."</p>
               <p>"Gerald proposed, and was accepted."</p>
               <p>"Grant told you."</p>
               <p>"No, he did not, but I have known, for a long time, that Gerald loved you, and I
                  hoped that it would meet with this result. He is good and noble, Minnie, and in
                  every way worthy of you. I hope that you may be very happy," said she, taking the
                  bright, blushing face between her hands and kissing her.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6609-00000056"/>
               <p>"Why did you not marry him, Cora? He proposed to you once, for he told me so
                  himself."</p>
               <p>"I did not love him, Minnie. Was not that a good reason?"</p>
               <p>"Now that I have given you my confidence, I think you might give me yours."</p>
               <p>"I am almost sure I could not tell you anything you do not know."</p>
               <p>"Yes you could. I may have surmised a great many things, but I am not certain that
                  Lain right."</p>
               <p>"Well, what is it you Wish to know?"</p>
               <p>"Are you and Grant Wardleigh engaged?"</p>
               <p>"We are."</p>
               <p>"Has Grant written to your father?"</p>
               <p>"He has, and received an answer. Father always liked Grant, and is pleased with my
                  choice."</p>
               <p>"I wonder what your father will say when he knows that I have accepted
                  Gerald?"</p>
               <p>"He will say you have acted wisely. Do you know, Minnie, you have won a man that a
                  dozen maneuvering mothers have failed in catching for their daughters. I trust you
                  will appreciate him as he deserves to be appreciated."</p>
               <p>"I trust I shall, I will try to make him happy, anyhow."</p>
               <p>"Who wants to play croquet?" said Minnie Heath, the next morning after breakfast,
                  standing in the doorway, and swinging a mallet in her hand.</p>
               <p>"We all do, I guess. Come, Cora, Eugene." Eugene thought he would force her to be
                  friendly, but to his great annoyance, she avoided him without seeming to, and
                  during the play she was never near him. Cora at last grew tired, and throwing down
                  her mallet, seated herself on a rustic bench. A very pretty picture she made as
                  she sat there, her fair face shaded by a broad-brimmed straw hat.</p>
               <p>"Eugene Tracy leaned lazily against the tree, and watched her. "What a fool I have
                  been," said he, to himself. "Jove! I would give a fortune to make her care for me
                  as she did once; and why can I not? I was never defeated in my life. At any rate,
                  I am not to be frightened by two rivals."</p>
               <p>"Miss Cora," said he, approaching her, "you remind me of Maud Muller."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; but she was never such an indolent piece of humanity, for you know, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Maud Muller, on a summer day,</l>
                        <l>Raked the meadow, sweet with hay."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Dear me! how poetical you are," said Minnie, seating herself by Cora's side, "and
                  how appropriate those lines were for there is the meadow with its new mown hay;
                  there the hill; over there the Judge, and here Maud Muller— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"And the Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,</l>
                        <l>And saw Maud Muller standing still.</l>
                        <l>A form more fair, a face more sweet,</l>
                        <l>Ne'er had it bee(r) his lot to meet."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Who knows but that he is thinking of this now; one might imagine he were to see
                  how intently he is gazing at you, Cora."</p>
               <p>"Minnie, be so kind as to entertain Mr. Tracy, I have letters to write, "and
                  without waiting for an answer, Cora was off.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6609-00000057"/>
               <p>"Well, that is decidedly cool," thought Eugene; but I will be even with her yet; I
                  won't be outwitted by a woman," and he frowned threateningly.</p>
               <p>"Just look at Cora and Judge Lingle! I thought she had letters to write. That will
                  be a match yet, don't you think?" asked Minnie, looking at him in a way that was
                  irritating.</p>
               <p>"Who the deuce cares? I don't."</p>
               <p>"Fie! fie! Mr. Tracy. To hear you talk, one would think you had some interest in
                  the matter."</p>
               <p>Cora's coolness piqued him, but Minnie's small talk annoyed him beyond
                  forbearance. She was a hasty but candid little creature, and from the very first
                  she did not hesitate to show him by word and manner what she thought of him, and
                  he detested her for it.</p>
               <p>"Do you love Cora?" she asked, at length, in a pitying sort of way, that added the
                  climax to his already irritated temper.</p>
               <p>"You are the most disagreeable woman I ever met!" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"And you are the most disagreeable man I ever met—Cora would be a fool to waste a
                  breath on you!" said she, petulantly.</p>
               <p>Eugene Tracy did not deign a reply, but strode angrily away to the house, entered
                  the library, and sat down by the window, feeling as miserable as only a man can
                  feel who has been defeated in the plans that lay so near his heart; for this woman
                  had touched his heart, that lay beneath the deep surface of vanity and sin,
                  hardened flirt though he was. But the love which should have purified and exalted
                  his nature, only made him more designing still, and he felt at that moment, if he
                  had the chance, that he would not hesitate in any way or manner to put his rivals
                  out of his path.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, Cora," asked Minnie.</p>
               <p>"To the library, to write my letters."</p>
               <p>"So you said, some time ago."</p>
               <p>"I intended to then, but Gerald wanted to speak to me."</p>
               <p>Cora came in, humming a song, selected her materials for writing, picked up her
                  pen and commenced, but when she saw Eugene at the window, and noticed how troubled
                  he looked, her hear reproached her for what she had done. She forgot the treatment
                  she had received from his hands four years ago, and laying down her pen, she
                  crossed the room, and laid her hand on his arm.</p>
               <p>"Eugene, will you forgive me for my rudeness to-day"</p>
               <p>How could he deny the pleading of the quivering lips, and the eyes which reminded
                  him of twin violets, looking into his. "I have nothing to forgive, Cora."</p>
               <p>"We are friends, then," said she, holding out her hand.</p>
               <p>"If you wish."</p>
               <p>"I do wish it, Eugene, for I know you are unhappy. Something troubles you. Can I
                  not help you?"</p>
               <p>"No, I am tired of life, that is all," said he, in a despairing sort of way.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Eugene, why should you be?—with wealth, talents, all in fact to make your
                  life pleasant and useful."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it is this wealth that has been my curse. Had I been forced to work for
                  a living, I should have been a better man to day."</p>
               <p>"But don't you remember what good you once told me you were going to do with all
                  this wealth?"</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6609-00000058"/>
               <p>"Remember? Yes, often. Oh, if I could only retrace my steps and start again?"</p>
               <p>"Why not commence now? You are young yet."</p>
               <p>"I feel so degraded, and so steeped in wickedness, that I have not the strength to
                  rise, Cora."</p>
               <p>"Carlyle says, 'From the lowest depths, there is a path to the loftiest heights.'
                  Only form your purpose, Eugene, then resolve that it shall be victory or death,
                  and you can accomplish anything."</p>
               <p>"It is too late," said he, sadly.</p>
               <p>"It is never too late," said she, earnestly, laying her hand on his bowed head in
                  a caressing manner, as of old. Then half frightened at her boldness, she left, the
                  room.</p>
               <p>All the good in his nature was aroused at this woman's ' words, and he really did
                  feel disgusted with himself. She seemed so pure, so high above him, that for the
                  time he felt like leading a better life; but such feelings with men of his nature,
                  come as the sunbeams, and vanish as quickly.</p>
               <p>"Did you write your letters, Cora," asked Minnie, that night, as they were
                  preparing to retire. "Why do you ask?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, only because I saw you talking very earnestly to Eugene Tracy about the time
                  I thought you were writing. I detest him."</p>
               <p>"He has faults, Minnie, like the rest of us. He is an orphan, and his life has
                  never been shielded like ours. Perhaps, had we been placed in his position, and
                  surrounded by all the temptations that a fortune like his too surely brings, we
                  would have been no better. You must remember this, Minnie, and judge him
                  accordingly."</p>
               <p>"Well, he need not be so crusty."</p>
               <p>"I suspect you Were teazing him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was, Jut he deserved it. Are you angry with me, Cora?" said she, putting
                  her arms about her, in a coaxing way.</p>
               <p>"Angry! how could I be?" said she, looking into the bright face and black eyes
                  that were sparkling with mischief.</p>
               <p>"Have I tired your patience?" asked Minnie, as she came down the stairs, the next
                  morning to take a walk.</p>
               <p>"No, we are in no great hurry," replied Gerald.</p>
               <p>"How grand!" said Cora, asp they entered a grove, where the dewdrops hung
                  glittering like diamonds on every spray, and the air was jubilant with the song of
                  birds. "Minnie, one hour of this is worth fifty of Saratoga."</p>
               <p>"Yes, or any other fashionable watering place. The air itself is
                  exhilarating."</p>
               <p>"We can do justice to our breakfast, after such as walk," said Cora.</p>
               <p>"Where have you been?" greeted them from all, as they entered the house.</p>
               <p>"We have had such a delightful walk; are we late for breakfast?" asked Minnie.</p>
               <p>Yes, Chloe has been scolding because the muffins were getting cold. Put your
                  flowers down, and come in and get her in good humor," said Ida.</p>
               <p>"I must place them in water, first; beautiful to let them wither."</p>

               <p>THE summer had drifted into autumn, and it was time Grant Wardleigh's guests were
                  returning home. It was! a beautiful place, and the family were so pleasant, that
                  they kept putting off, their departure from day to day. But the last night had
                  come; to-morrow they were to leave. They had visited all their old haunts, that
                  day, with feelings akin to sorrow. Grant and Cora lingered long at Blanch's grave,
                  where they had first plighted their love, and laid upon it a wreath of pale autumn
                  flowers.</p>
               <p>"They were all gathered in the parlor, talking over the pleasures of the summer,
                  and wondering when they would meet again. For once, the fun-loving Minnie was
                  still, and bade them good night with a sober face. Cora and Eugene were the last
                  to leave.</p>
               <p>"Don't go," said he, as she arose from her chair. Sing for me once more; you
                  promised, you know."</p>
               <p>She hesitated a moment, then sat down at the piano, ran over a prelude, and sang, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I have just been learning the lesson of life,</l>

               <p>She stopped there, looked up into his face, then arose and walked out on the
                  verandah. He followed her.</p>
               <p>"Cora," he asked "has the lesson of life been a sad one to you?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you ask," said she, moving away a little proudly.</p>
               <p>"You know why I ask, Cora. You know how I treated you, four years ago; but I do
                  love you now—yes, as truly as man ever can love."</p>
               <p>"You told a girl that once, and she believed you. Pardon me, but I am a woman
                  now."</p>
               <p>"But I am madly, deadly in earnest now. Forget and forgive the past, Cora. Tell me
                  how to prove my love, and see how gladly I will do it."</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to forgive, for I forgave your neglect long ago; nor do I wish to
                  prove your love, for I am engaged."</p>
               <p>"May I ask to whom?"</p>
               <p>"Grant Wardleigh."</p>
               <p>"He is the only one worthy of you, Cora. You have had your revenge."</p>
               <p>"Don't think me so mean as to have wished anything of the kind. You misjudge me,
                  Eugene."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry; forgive me."</p>
               <p>She could not help pitying him, as he stood there in the moonlight, with that sad,
                  despairing look on his handsome face.</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6609-00000060"/>
               <p>"Eugene," she said, at last, "I want you always to be my friend. I am greatly
                  interested in you, and I want to see you happy; want to see you fill the position
                  that your wealth and talents will enable you to fill. If you love me, as you say
                  you do, let that love then be the means of placing you where I shall be proud of
                  you.</p>
               <p>"I cannot promise you that it will, Cora. One glance at the past is enough to make
                  me give up in despair; it has been so utterly worthless."</p>
               <p>"If looking into the past has a tendency to create dispondency, then you should
                  not dwell on such things. Remember that the future is before you, and I want you
                  to promise that you will live to do good."</p>
               <p>"I promise, Cora, but you know not how weak I am."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. Now Eugene, I must say good night."</p>
               <p>"Must you go? Oh it is a bitter thought to know that I shall never see you again
                  as Cora Benoir! But may love and happiness ever be yours. And now, Cora, darling
                  Cora," said he, taking her in his arms, and kissing her on the brow, "good
                  night."</p>
               <p>Long ere Cora awoke the next morning Eugene Tracy was far away. Who knows but this
                  woman's words may be the means of infusing into his heart a new faith, a new
                  purpose, and the life that we thought so wrecked, so incapable of any good, shall
                  blossom forth in all the nobleness for which it was designed? God grant that it
                  may!</p>
               <p>There was the hurry and bustle that there always is previous to the departure of a
                  fashionable party. The girls had gathered in one room, and were talking and
                  packing trunks with great rapidity.</p>
               <p>"Oh, girls, will I ever! get through?" asked Minnie, coming in with her arms
                  loaded with dresses, and tossing them down by her trunk. Just look at that cool,
                  provoking Cora, sitting over there, like "patience on a monument," while I m in
                  such a fidget. Dear me! I shall not get dressed in time for breakfast, and old
                  Aunt Chloe will make such a fuss. Cora, do come and help me—that is a good
                  girl!"</p>
               <p>"I will pack your trunk, or rather finish packing it," said she, laughing at the
                  heedless manner in which the articles had been thrown in, "and you can go and
                  dress."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my mentor."</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. Tracy," said Minnie, glancing around the breakfast table.</p>
               <p>"You must give him a lecture on early rising, Mr. Wardleigh, said Ida Nathan."</p>
               <p>"Eugene is not here," replied he, "he left on the night train."</p>
               <p>"What did he do that for?" asked Minnie. "It was a shame in him to desert us, just
                  when we needed him to make our party a jolly one."</p>
               <p>"Business demanded it, I suppose," said Grant, "for he came to my room last night,
                  and said he found it would be best for him to leave on that train."</p>
               <p>"I think it strange he left, so suddenly. He said nothing about going, last
                  night," said Minnie. "What do you think about it, Cora?'"</p>
               <p>"I think he must have a reason for leaving."</p>
               <p>Minnie gave her an inquisitive look that attracted Grant Wardleigh's attention.
                  Cora blushed as he, too, looked at her, but said nothing.</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6609-00000061"/>
               <p>"Nine o'clock," said Grant, suddenly rising from his chain "Nearly train time, you
                  see. We had better start."</p>
               <p>"Good bye, Cora," said Mrs. Wardleigh, taking her hands. "I am sorry to see you
                  leave, but I hope it will not be long until Grant brings you back to us."</p>
               <p>"It will not be my fault, if I don't, mother," said he, smiling.</p>
               <p>It was a merry party that started from the station, and a still merrier one as
                  they took a boat on the Hudson, and met a party of old friends, who like
                  themselves were returning from their summer retreat, among-whom was Mrs. Brainard
                  and Estella.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Brainard looks more disagreeable than ever, and Estella like a snow woman,"
                  said Minnie to Gerald.</p>
               <p>"I have always thought Estella very beautiful." "So have I, but it is frozen
                  beauty; I shiver to look at her."</p>
               <p>"Where is Eugene?" asked Mrs. Brainard, of Grant, as he was walking up and down
                  the deck with Cora. I have been looking for him, but do not see him. Has he not
                  been visiting you?"</p>
               <p>"He has," replied Grant, but he left last night, and as I supposed business was
                  the cause, I did not question him."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Brainard glanced at Cora, then moved away, her head elevated like an
                  "antelope scenting danger from afar."</p>
               <p>Grant laughed. "Mrs. Brainard is vexed about Eugene. It is a little strange that
                  he left so suddenly."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Brainard need not look at me so suspiciously, for there is no need of it
                  now," said Cora.</p>
               <p>Grant looked at her, questioningly.</p>
               <p>"Did not Eugene tell you?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me what?"</p>
               <p>"We were engaged, once."</p>
               <p>"How long ago?" asked he in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Four years ago."</p>
               <p>"Did she break it?" asked he, pointing to Mrs. Brainard.</p>
               <p>"No, he broke it himself. I was a school girl then, and very young. He caught my
                  fancy, with his handsome face and polite manners, and I thought I loved him
                  dearly—yes so dearly, that I would have given up every thing, and have waited
                  years had it been necessary. But he said, we could not marry; that cruel fate had
                  separated us. So carefully had he concealed his falseness from me, that this was
                  the first glance I had of his true character; but that was enough. He had only
                  been flirting with me, and it helped to cure me of my folly. I suffered intensely
                  at first, but after a time he dropped as completely out of my life as if he had
                  never existed. Mrs. Brainard wished him to marry Estella, and believed me to be
                  the cause of his not doing so, and as he is still unmarried, she continues to look
                  on me with suspicion."</p>
               <p>"Did you never see Eugene after he broke the engagement?"</p>
               <p>"No; he started for South America immediately, and until he visited your home, I
                  knew nothing more about him. You know that I have constantly been thrown in his
                  society for the last few weeks, and only last night he again asked me to be his
                  wife. This time he appeared, to be sincere, but of course was refused, which
                  accounts for his hasty departure last night, though he said nothing<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000062"/> ing about going."</p>
               <p>"Had you not been engaged to me, would your answer have been the same?" said
                  Grant, showing how easily he could be excited to jealousy.</p>
               <p>"Certainly it would, for I did not love him. You are not angry?" she asked,
                  looking up into his sober face. "I did not tell you this before, because he was
                  your friend, and knew if I told you that you would have lost your confidence him.
                  But I intended to tell you what happened last night, if he did not."</p>
               <p>"I am not angry with you, Cora; I knew Eugene was unprincipled in some things, but
                  never thought he would have done an act like that."</p>
               <p>"I want you to be his friend still, Grant, for I really think he now means to do
                  what is right. We ought to be thankful, at least I ought to be, for had not things
                  happened as they have, I would never have loved you. You will forgive him now? for
                  I have."</p>
               <p>"You are the most generous woman living, Cora, and I am not half worthy of
                  you."</p>
               <p>"There, not an other word of that," said Cora. "Please don't," said she, when he
                  talked on, "for here comes Minnie. She half suspects the truth now, and I would
                  not have her certain of it, for she so dislikes Eugene that she would let him know
                  it, the first time they met."</p>
               <p>"Dear me! Cora, what a sober face you have. Is Mrs. Brainard the cause?" asked
                  Minnie.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Brainard only wanted to know where Eugene is," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Well, that is just what I am dying to find out. You know where he is. Now; Cora,
                  own up."</p>
               <p>"No, Minnie, I do not know where he is."</p>
               <p>"Well, you at least know what he left for. You won't tell? Well I can guess. He
                  proposed to you last night. I knew he would when I saw him stop you as you were
                  about to leave the room, for he has been watching you with hungry eyes, for some
                  time past. Mrs. Brainard is very much disappointed because she did not find him
                  here. She came to me a few moments ago, and asked in her sly way, a number of
                  questions about you and Eugene. But 1 told her that she need not worry, for you
                  were already engaged to Grant."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Minnie!" exclaimed Cora.</p>
               <p>"Now, what harm was there in telling her? She would soon have known it,
                  anyhow."</p>
               <p>There was really no harm, but I do not like the way in which you told her."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Cora, but it vexed me to hear her worry herself so much about your
                  affairs, and caused me to make that saucy answer. See! the boat is going to land.
                  How glad I am, for I was never so tired in my life."</p>
               <p>The creme de la creme of New York was in a flutter when their engagements came
                  out. The best matches of the season, all said. Mr. Benoir might justly feel proud
                  of his son-in-law, elect, for he was the finest gentleman in their circle, and
                  Gerald Lingle might think himself fortunate in getting Mr. Benoir's ward. It was
                  not every man that could make half a million by marrying, the mercenary people
                  said.</p>
               <p>"So, Minnie, you think you are going to be married for love, and not for money,"
                  said Mr. Benoir, after their arrival.</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6609-00000063"/>
               <p>"He is not going to marry me for money. You cannot make me lose my trust in him,
                  say what you will."</p>
               <p>"Nor would I have you," said he, seriously. When are you going to marry
                  Gerald?"</p>
               <p>"Whenever Cora marries Grant. I am in no hurry to leave you, my guardian, for you
                  have been like a father to me, and endured my wilfulness with kindness and
                  patience.</p>
               <p>"You have always acted in obedience to my wishes, Minnie, and it has been a
                  pleasure to have you with me. Have you set any definite time for your marriage?"
                  said, he, turning to Cora.</p>
               <p>"No, father, I have thought nothing seriously about, it. I am in no hurry to leave
                  you, either."</p>
               <p>"I forgot to tell you Cora," said Minnie, after Mr. Benoir had left the room,
                  "when I told Mrs. Brainard, yesterday, that you were engaged to Grant, Estella was
                  standing by, and grew so pale that I was frightened. Do you believe she cares
                  anything for Grant".</p>
               <p>"I think not."</p>

               <p>"MR. CLAYMORE is in the parlor, ma'am," said a servant, looking into the room
                  where Mrs. Brainard and Estella were sitting, the former reading, the latter
                  pretending to embroider a pair of slippers, but her eyes were fixed in a deep
                  study, and her hands lay motionless in her lap.</p>
               <p>"Are you sure he wants me—is it not Estella?" said Mrs. Brainard, at the same time
                  glancing at her daughter, to see if she would evince any surprise.</p>
               <p>"If Estella heard, she gave no sign; but sat still, and drew her needle
                  indifferently through her embroidery.</p>
               <p>"Very well. Tell him I will be down directly," said she, going to the mirror, and
                  re-arranging the great coil of hair at the back of her head. Then opening the
                  door, she descended to the parlor.</p>
               <p>Estella raised her eyes as the door closed, and leaning back in her chair, gave a
                  little scornful laugh, for she thought how devotedly he had followed her footsteps
                  all summer, and how repeatedly she had chilled him whenever he attemped to offer
                  himself—and now he had come to her mother for help!</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mrs. Brainard, about an hour after, as she entered the room, "I
                  suppose you know what Mr. Claymore wanted?"</p>
               <p>"How should I know?"</p>
               <p>"He wants you to be his wife."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! and expects me to consent after the petition has been delivered
                  second-handed. Mr. Claymore ought to have known me better."</p>
               <p>"He was afraid you would refuse him."</p>
               <p>"What did he come for, then?"</p>
               <p>"Estella, you put me out of all patience."</p>
               <p>"Oh, pray don't let me!" said she, ironically.</p>
               <p>"Estella, will you accept this man, or not?"</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly I will not. Go down and tell him so at once."</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6609-00000064"/>
               <p>"He is not here, and if he were, you should be the one to tell him."</p>
               <p>"That would be a great pleasure for me. I will write him a note, for it will save
                  him the trouble of calling again," and she crossed the room for her writing
                  desk,</p>
               <p>"No, you will not write him a note," said Mrs. Brainard, who darting forward,
                  seized the writing desk, threw it into a drawer, locked it, and put the key in her
                  pocket.</p>
               <p>Estella surveyed her movements with the greatest nonchalance, then said, quietly,
                  "I can find pen, ink and paper in any store in the city."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard, before replying, went to the window, and for a few minutes gazed
                  intently on the street below, then came back to Estella, and said, in a voice just
                  then marvelous for its tenderness, "My daughter, why are you so careless of your
                  own interests? Mr. Claymore is wealthy, and of a good family. What more could you
                  wish?"</p>
               <p>"Suppose I should ask for one I could love, and that would love me in return, just
                  for myself alone, and not for the wealth I might bring him," said Estella, for the
                  first time aroused, and something like a quiver in her voice which was usually so
                  cold and even.</p>
               <p>"A great fool would he be who could do that," said her mother, scornfully.
                  "Estella, after last winter's experience, I should think you would have banished
                  such sentiments forever."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" she asked, looking up quickly in her mother's face.</p>
               <p>"I refer to your penchant for Mr. Wardleigh. You were in his society more or less
                  last winter, and tried by all the arts woman can command, to lure him on to a
                  proposal of marriage. I know it all, but what has it amounted to?"</p>
               <p>"Estella sat still and bit her lips, while her face was scarlet, even to the roots
                  of her hair. "It was mean, yes, contemptible," said she, angrily, "for you to
                  watch my movements with only one aim, and that to glory over my defeat, as you are
                  now doing, and no true mother would taunt her daughter with anything she knew had
                  caused her much suffering."</p>
               <p>"Suffering! Estella, talk sense. Nothing could touch your heart. Indeed I have
                  often wondered if you had a heart. That marble statue on the bracket yonder, seems
                  to have as much feeling as you."</p>
               <p>"Because I am outwardly so much like my mother, it does not prove that I have no
                  feeling."</p>
               <p>"You are not like me," said her mother, sharply. You resemble your father, are as
                  stubborn and as wilful when you take the notion."</p>
               <p>"Ah, what a pity it is that I do not possess more of his traits of character. If I
                  did, you might have a hope of getting rid of me, but as it is, there is no help
                  for it."</p>
               <p>"I will see if there is no help for it," said her mother, in an angry tone.</p>
               <p>"We shall see," said Estella, her eyes flashing.</p>
               <p>"We shall see," echoed her mother, going out and slamming the door.</p>
               <p>"Estella sat still. Her face which a moment ago was flushed with anger, was now
                  one of hopeless dejection. She buried her face in her hands, and, proud, worldly
                  woman that people thought her, wept like a child. Ah,<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000065"/> the world sees only the surface of the heart, and
                  knows nothing of the great waves of remorse and sorrow that at times sweep over
                  the soul. If it did, it would be less severe in its censure.</p>
               <p>"This will never do," said Estella, getting up and bathing her face. "It is nearly
                  four o'clock, and I will soon be summoned down to dinner. I have no desire to wear
                  my heart upon my sleeve, particularly in her presence."</p>
               <p>"When Estella entered the dining room, a short time after, all traces of tears
                  were removed, and her manner as cold and haughty as if no emotion had ever moved
                  her.</p>
               <p>"I have just, received a letter from your cousin Eugene. He is with his
                  grandmother," said Mrs. Brainard, as Estella sat down.</p>
               <p>Estella did not reply, but dipped her spoon leisurely, up and down in her cup of
                  coffee.</p>
               <p>"I have just received a letter from Eugene," repeated her mother.</p>
               <p>"So I heard you say a moment ago."</p>
               <p>"He is visiting his grandmother," Mrs. Brainard went on, "and she has sent a very
                  urgent invitation for you to visit her. Eugene is anxious that you should come,
                  too. I want you to go Estella, for much depends upon this visit. You have
                  heretofore seemed unconscious of the possibility of sharing his wealth, and I want
                  you to come back his promised wife. Now this is your last chance, for in the
                  spring, he writes, he will leave for an extended European tour. They live a very
                  retired life at his grandmother's, and consequently you will have no rivals, and
                  if the result is not what I expect, I shall conclude it is your own fault, for I
                  cannot believe my daughter so devoid of personal attractions as to be unable to
                  win a husband." said she, in a tone intended to touch her pride and to arouse her
                  to action; but Estella had been used to such insinuations all her life, and it
                  fell on her ear unheeded, though not unheard.</p>
               <p>Estella listened until she was through without saying a word, then she looked
                  steadily at her mother, and said, "Suppose I should meet with success, and after
                  the desired point had been gained, I should refuse—what then?</p>
               <p>"Then you must many Mr. Claymore."</p>
               <p>"Must? Please explain."</p>
               <p>"Well, there are two good reasons. In the first place, you know, or at least you
                  ought to know, that since your father died—contrary to public opinion—our income
                  has been small, so small indeed, that I have had to sacrifice some of the property
                  to defray the expense of the trip we have taken this summer. I have done it with
                  the aim of procuring you a rich husband, but so far I have been disappointed. And
                  that brings me to the second reason, which is, that I have my own interests to
                  look to, and cannot be burdened with an old maid daughter."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Estella, darting a sharp look at her mother, "I thought there was some
                  personal interest in the matter, for I never knew you to advocate a case very
                  warmly unless there was. What a pity you are Eugene's aunt. You are so youthful
                  looking, when you call into requisition all the cosmetics on your toilet table,
                  that you might win him yourself. And there is Mr. Claymore, who is old enough to
                  be my father. I am sure he<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6609-00000066"/> would make
                  you the most suitable husband. Take him, do, and don't try to force him on
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"I would be ashamed not to have any more love or respect for a mother than to talk
                  to her in that manner," said Mrs. Brainard, in an angry voice.</p>
               <p>"Love! respect!" exclaimed Estella, while a smile played around her mouth. "Let me
                  answer you by quoting from one of your favorite authors:. 'Love begets love;
                  respect begets respect.' Now that I have finished, pray excuse me," said she, with
                  mock courtesy.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard let her go, feeling as if she would like to have dashed after her
                  the cup she held in her hand.</p>
               <p>"It is nearly time for Mr. Claymore to call," said Mrs. Brainard that evening, to
                  herself, as she glanced the clock, "and what to do I hardly know. She won't see
                  him, or if she did, she would refuse him, that is certain, and that will never do,
                  for marry him she must, if Eugene won't have her. Then after she is gone I will
                  have a chance for myself. There! I declare, if that is not the bell, now. Hannah
                  go to the door."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mr. Claymore, good evening,!' said she, rustling into the parlor, a few
                  minutes after.</p>
               <p>"Good evening," said the portly figure, rising with some difficulty from the easy
                  chair. "Ahem!" and he played uneasily with his watch chain. "Where is your
                  daughter?"</p>
               <p>"The dear girl has a terrible headache, and begged me to come in her place," said
                  she, in a bland manner.</p>
               <p>"Did you tell her what I wanted?" asked he, with some hesitation.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I broached the subject to her, but she was in no mood to listen. I think if
                  you only wait awhile, she will give you a hearing."</p>
               <p>"But if she should refuse me?" said he, nervously.</p>
               <p>"If she should refuse you," said Mrs. Brainard, trying to repress a smile, "why
                  then, of course, you could do nothing more; but you should not be
                  faint-hearted."</p>
               <p>"I am not faint-hearted, madam, but if I humble myself to ask her to be my wife,
                  it would be a great mortification to have her refuse."</p>
               <p>"Most people would not think so. Love surmounts all difficulties."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, madam," said he, dryly, "but I never professed to love your daughter.
                  I consider her a very estimable young lady, also very handsome and stylish, but I
                  do not love her, nor do I ask for love in return. I want to give my house a fine
                  mistress, one who can rule over my household with taste, and do credit to my
                  guests, and such a one I believe I shall find in your daughter."</p>
               <p>"He waited a minute after having delivered this little pompous speech, to see if
                  she would reply, but as she did not, he arose to leave, remarking, "As there is no
                  prospect of seeing your daughter at present, I might as well say goodnight."</p>
               <p>"Good night, sir."</p>
               <p>"What a conceited fool!" said Mrs. Brainard, as soon as the! door closed. "What a
                  'shade of the mighty ' he thinks himself. Estella, frivolous as she is, is too
                  good for him, but it is no time to have conscientious scruples. He will let her
                  dress, and fill the house with guests, and she will be content."</p>
               <p>"Now for another lecture," said Estella, the next<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000067"/> morning, as she stood before the mirror, brushing
                  out her long sunny hair, before going down to breakfast. "I wonder what she told
                  Mr. Claymore last night. I hope he will feel himself insulted, and stay away in
                  the future. No wonder father buried himself so much in his library. For my part, I
                  would as soon face a band of savages, as to face her when she is bent on putting
                  one of her darling projects into execution, I sometimes wonder if she really can
                  be my mother, we understand and love each other so little. How ridiculous it is in
                  her to try to make me marry Eugene, or old Mr. Claymore! How Eugene would laugh if
                  he knew she looked upon him as her future son-in-law! No, my aristocratic mama,
                  if ever I marry, it will be a man of Mr. Ward-leigh's stamp, and not a thorough
                  man of the world, like Eugene Tracy. Ah, how happy Cora Benoir must be! and yet,
                  Cora was once the betrothed of my dissipated cousin, and loved him dearly, too, if
                  there is any truth in the notes from her that I found in an old portfolio of his,
                  not long ago. How we do live things clown in this world! I am ready, I believe,"
                  said she, taking a last, look in the glass. Then she sauntered slowly down the
                  stairs, into the dining room, and took her seat at the table.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard looked up and gave her a frigid good morning, and then, to Estella's
                  surprise, was silent the rest! of the meal. Thus two or three days passed, each
                  ignoring the other's presence, only when it was actually necessary to use a few
                  words of common courtesy. Mrs. Brainard grew uneasy at last, when she saw Estella
                  gave no signs of relenting. One morning she again broached the old subject.</p>
               <p>"Estella, when are you going to make that promised visit?"</p>
               <p>"I have no recollection of promising to visit any one."</p>
               <p>"Why, are you not going to do as Eugene wished?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," replied she, with emphasis.</p>
               <p>"Very well, then, Stewart shall hand over to you what remains as your portion, and
                  you can go. Such an ungrateful daughter shall not stay under my roof any
                  longer."</p>
               <p>"Just as, you please, mother; your society is not so delightful that one should
                  desire to remain in it. But aren't you afraid such a course will ruin your future
                  prospects? Your elderly gentlemen friends will be sure to think you are somewhat
                  cramped in money affairs, and what would they want you for but-your wealth?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard shot a fierce glance of hatred at her daughter, but she leisurely
                  buttered her toast and took no notice of it.</p>
               <p>"Miss. Estella, here is a letter your mother told me to give you," said Hannah,
                  coming out into the hall as Estella prepared to go and call on Cora, the morning
                  after her conversation with her mother.</p>
               <p>"From Engene," said she, breaking the seal and sitting down on the steps to read
                  it. A smile played around her lips as she read the postscript, as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"Estella, if you have any heart, you will take pity on me and accept
                     grandmother's invitation. It is dreadful lonely here, and I am dying to see
                     some one, but am obliged to stay awhile, out of respect to the old lady. Come,
                     and bring me all die latest news."</p>
               </q>
               <p>"The latest news!" said Estella to herself. "I suppose that means all about Cora
                  and Grant. I wonder if he does care anything for her. "Hannah, tell mother<pb
                     n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6609-00000068"/> that I shall be home for dinner," said
                  she as she passed out of the door.</p>
               <p>"Cora," said Estella, as she arose to go, after having made her call, "I have just
                  received a letter from Eugene. He is at his grandmother's, and he is so lonely
                  there that he wants me to visit them. I have a mind to go."</p>
               <p>"I would if I were you, Estella; you don't know what good you might do him. Your
                  presence would shield him from so many temptations," said she, speaking with more
                  warmth than she intended.</p>
               <p>Estella watched her somewhat narrowly, for she was trying to see what effect her
                  words would have. Cora noticed it, and grew embarrassed.</p>
               <p>"When would you think of starting, Estella?" she asked at length.</p>
               <p>"Immediately."</p>
               <p>"Grant is going to leave to-morrow evening for S——. I believe it is very near the
                  place where Eugene now is] He would be glad to take you under his protection, I
                  know. I will tell him to-night, if you wish me to."</p>
               <p>She had not really thought of going, but to know that here was an opportunity to
                  be near him, was enough to change her mind? and she accepted it gratefully,
                  without hesitation.</p>
               <p>"Cora, you have not told me anything about your marriage," said Estella, as she
                  was about to leave, "is it to be soon?"</p>
               <p>"No, not for a year, at least. You shall get timely warning to appear when it has
                  been arranged," said Cora, smiling. Please give Eugene my kindest regards."</p>
               <p>"What a fool I have been to consent to go," said Estella, to herself, as she
                  walked homeward. "It is only laying more sorrow in store for me. The oftener I see
                  him, the greater will be the struggle to crush out this feeling. I was mad, blind,
                  to let myself be so deluded. I might have known from the first that he loved Cora.
                  One by one every joy has melted from my grasp. Once, <q>

                  like a troubled sea. Oh, Grant! you had it in your hands to make a good, true
                  woman of me," she cried.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Estella, entering the room where she was sitting, "I will start on
                  that long talked of visit tomorrow, if you have no objection."</p>
               <p>"I have none," said her mother, careful not to show how much it pleased her.</p>
               <p>"Very well, then it is settled."</p>
               <p>"What has Eugene written?"</p>
               <p>"His letter was very brief. He said he was very lonely; but here is the letter;
                  you may read it if you wish."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid Eugene is in trouble. He does not stay in that dreary place for
                  nothing," said Mrs. Brainard, glancing over his letter.</p>
               <p>"He says, does he not, that he stays out of respect for his grandmother?"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! Eugene cares too little for any person's opinion to subject himself to
                  any privations. Mark my words, he is in some difficulty."</p>

               <p>"Nothing serious, I think. Eugene never goes beyond a certain point in
                  anything."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there is no telling what a man would do. What train will you leave on?"</p>
               <p>"The earliest evening train."</p>
               <p>"Would it not be better to start in the morning?"</p>
               <p>"If I were going alone, it would be, but Mr. Wardleigh will start on the evening
                  train for S——; it is near my destination, you know. Cora said it would be better
                  to wait and have him go with me."</p>
               <p>"Estella, Mr. Wardleigh wishes to see you," said Mrs. Brainard, the next morning
                  after breakfast.</p>
               <p>"Cora told me you were going to see Eugene," said Grant, as Estella entered the
                  room. "I shall be happy to accompany you as far as S——. Shall I call for you this
                  evening?"</p>
               <p>"If it will put you to no inconvenience?"</p>
               <p>"None at all. Excuse me for not staying longer, but I shall be very busy until I
                  leave."</p>
               <p>Estella went to her room, and had almost, completed packing her trunk, when she
                  suddenly stopped and said, "I would like to know what I am going for. It is not
                  because this visit promises to be a pleasant one, for it truly will not, nor
                  because my mother will be pleased at my going, but, it is because, for a few
                  hours, 1 shall, have the pleasure of being by Giant's side. What folly!" and she
                  threw down the lid of her trunk so heavily that it jarred the shelves above her
                  head, bringing down an old portfolio of Eugene's, and scattering the letters it
                  contained, over the floor. Estella gathered them up, and was about to replace
                  them, when she noticed they were the old notes of Cora's that she had read a short
                  time before. A new thought floated across her mind; she put them together, tied
                  them with a string, and placed them in her trunk. Long after, that one act caused
                  her years of suffering and remorse, for it changed the whole current of her
                  life.</p>

               <p>IT was a cozy little room in which Estella was sitting. A bright fire glowed in
                  the grate, throwing its light over the soft carpet, luxuriant chairs, and
                  pictures, brackets and statues that adorned the walls. On a divan, near one of the
                  windows, reclined Eugene, a volume of Ruskin in his hand, but his eyes were fixed
                  on Migon, hanging opposite.</p>
               <p>"What do you find so attractive in that picture?" asked Estella.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking how much it resembled Cora Benoir."</p>
               <p>"Eugene, why did you not marry Cora Benoir?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I never wanted to," said he, his dark eyes scanning her face to see if he
                  could read what she was aiming at.</p>
               <p>"There may be some truth in that, but why were you engaged to her?"</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6609-00000070"/>
               <p>"Could I not be engaged to her without having any serious intentions?" asked he,
                  impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but that would not be honorable."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk of honor, Estella, for neither of us have much of it."</p>
               <p>"You are very frank, for once in your life."</p>
               <p>"It is a pity I am not always so. Come, tell me how you found out I was ever
                  engaged to her. Did she tell you?"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever know Cora to tell anything?" "You refuse to tell?" "At present I
                  do."</p>
               <p>"Very well, I am not anxious to know."</p>
               <p>"I did not suppose you would be. Do you know how long she has been engaged to
                  Grant Wardleigh?"</p>
               <p>"How should I know?"</p>
               <p>"I thought Grant and you were such intimate friends."</p>
               <p>"So we are, but he did not tell me that. Men don't talk about their affairs as
                  women do," replied he, getting up and leaving the the room, as if the conversation
                  displeased him.</p>
               <p>"How provoking he is," mentally exclaimed Estella. If he cares for Cora, he does
                  not show it. Yet, 1 am convinced something is the matter, or he would not have
                  left Wardleigh's so suddenly, and Cora would not speak so shyly of him. I hope his
                  interest may be as great as mine, for without his aid my plan would accomplish
                  nothing, and I want to be certain of my mark before I betray myself."</p>
               <p>Sorrow makes us either better or worse. Had Estella's life flowed on in a smooth,
                  unbroken channel, it would have been free from shame or blame. But her happiness
                  had all been swept away at one fell swoop, and after her first paroxysm of sorrow,
                  she was determined to regain it, if it was within the limit of human power. A few
                  months ago she would have been horrified at the scheme she had planned, but now
                  she did not stop to think of the wrong or its consequences. Eugene, unprincipled
                  as he was, had sent for her with no deeper motive than to hear about Cora, but she
                  had gone to find a confederate in her crime.</p>
               <p>"What a blue day it is," said Estella, an hour later, coming to the window where
                  Eugene was looking out at the drenching rain.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it makes me miserable. How I detest such weather!" <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Into each life some rain must fall,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> hummed he. There is more truth than poetry in those lines, don't you think,
                  Estella?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if one may judge from experience."</p>
               <p>"Estella, I would give up every cent I possess, to be a boy again."</p>
               <p>She looked incredulous.</p>
               <p>"Believe it or not, I am tired to death of the life I have led for the last five
                  years."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"You, who pretend to know me so well, ought not to ask why. Truly the way, of the
                  transgressor is hard.'"</p>
               <p>"Have you just found that out?" asked Estella, ironically.</p>
               <p>"No, but it never came home with such force, until—." He stopped there and did not
                  finish the sentence.</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6609-00000071"/>
               <p>"Until you were bitterly disappointed," said she, finishing it for him. "Eugene, I
                  can tell your past better than any astrologer."</p>
               <p>"Please favor me with a recital of all my misdeeds," said he, laughing, and
                  sitting down in a chain "I am just in a mood to listen."</p>
               <p>"I shall only tell you of what is grieving you most You flirted with Cora Benoir
                  when she was a pale, faded, and rather awkward girl, staying at our home. You had
                  been used to the society of ladies who were as great flirts as yourself, but here
                  was one entirely different from any you had ever met. She was young and innocent,
                  and so full of truth that she did not doubt the truthfulness of others. You took
                  advantage of all this, and gained her love, then becoming wearied of it, trampled
                  on it. She bore this as women of her disposition always do—without complaint or
                  murmur. After long years you met her again, and the pale, awkward girl had matured
                  into a beautiful, graceful woman, and as good as beautiful, when you fell in love
                  with her in earnest, but it was too late," said she, speaking slowly and watching
                  his face closely, to see if she had hit the truth. "And that is why," she went on,
                  "you are moping away here by yourself. Is it not so, cousin?"</p>
               <p>He darted a half sad, half sullen glance at her, and said, "If it were, you are
                  not the one to tell it to. You are so unsympathetic."</p>
               <p>Estella was gaining her point, and not heeding his reply, she said, " Suppose all
                  obstacles were removed from your path; would you marry Cora?"</p>
               <p>"Gladly," said he, forgetting his anxiety to conceal from her the truth.</p>
               <p>"Well then, suppose I could remove these obstacles."</p>
               <p>"How could you do it?" asked he, looking up, quickly into her face.</p>
               <p>"Believe me, I can do it if you will help me."</p>
               <p>"You could not honorably."</p>
               <p>"Let me remind you of what you said a few moments ago about honor."</p>
               <p>"But I promised Cora I would try and lead a different life."</p>
               <p>"Oh well, then, I do not want to make you break your promise," and she walked
                  away.</p>
               <p>"Come back, Estella: don't be foolish; I wait to ask you something."</p>
               <p>"Well, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"Have you not some self interest in the matter? It seems to me you are very
                  anxious about it."</p>
               <p>"Could I not be so, because I want to see you happy?"</p>
               <p>"No, Estella, you never take trouble for nothing."</p>
               <p>"Would you be very much surprised to hear that I love Grant Wardleigh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, for I did not think your heart could be stirred to anything deeper than self
                  love. Don't look at me so fiercely, but tell me how you propose to work this
                  miracle."</p>
               <p>"A few weeks ago I found an old portfolio of yours and in it were several notes
                  that she had written to you, the three weeks you visited here while she was with
                  us. Now, Eugene, all you will have to do is to change the date of each, and if
                  Grant comes to see us before he returns to New York, as he promised, to show him,
                  in a confidential way, one or more of these notes. He has never told you that he
                  was engaged to Cora, and will<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6609-00000072"/> take it
                  for granted you know nothing about it. I will do all that is needful. Grant will
                  lose his trust in Cora, and each will be too proud to ask for an explanation. Then
                  after a time you can urge your claims.</p>
               <p>"You tempt me, Estella; but it will break Cora's heart."</p>
               <p>Don't fear. She loved you first, loved you deeply, too. Who knows but that she
                  would have accepted you, had she been free, for she loved no one else for four
                  long years. Grant Wardleigh is a great favorite of her father. She may have
                  accepted him for that reason."</p>
               <p>It looked probable to Eugene. The song she sang him—her parting words—came before
                  his mind. Why would she take this interest, unless she cared for him,
                  particularly, after the way in which he had treated her?</p>
               <p>"What will you do?" asked Estella, impatient with his silence.</p>
               <p>"Have you the notes with you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and will get them in a moment."</p>
               <p>"I will think about it to-night, and tell you the result in the morning," said he,
                  as he took them.</p>
               <p>Ah, had the beautiful white-faced temptress forgotten a father's prayers, a
                  father's loving counsel? Did she think of the kindness of the friend whose life
                  she was blighting? One would have thought not, had they seen her as she paced up
                  and down the, room, a triumphant light in her eyes and a bright flush on her
                  cheeks.</p>
               <p>That night Eugene took the notes Estella had given him, and unfolding them, read
                  the contents which five years ago he had laughed to scorn. They were tender,
                  womanly little missives, and an electric thrill ran through his veins as he looked
                  over them now. Ah, he would have given all the wealth of the Orient, had he
                  possessed it, to know that she loved him, to receive only one line written by her
                  hand, breathing the same spirit the notes did. He took up a pen, changed the date
                  of one, then threw the pen down. The good angel was at work in his heart, and the
                  pale face of his mother, which long years ago had been laid in the coffin, came
                  before him. Should he drown all his good resolutions, and go back in the path
                  which had brought him but little pleasure, a great deal of sorrow, a great deal of
                  remorse? He took the notes and went to the grate. He would throw them in, put them
                  out of the way of tempting him. Then he thought of Estella's words, "She loved you
                  first; who knows but that she would have accepted you had she been free." He came
                  back to the table, laid the notes on it, and taking up the pen, again changed the
                  date of each to suit, then threw them into a drawer and locked it.</p>
               <p>He was tempted a dozen times that night to destroy the old letters. He thought of
                  Cora's advice, of his promise to her, then of Grant's kindness and the way he was
                  about to repay it. Had he known the utter impossibility of her ever loving him, he
                  would have been true to his resolve, but Estella awakened hope in his breast, and
                  selfishness conquered.</p>
               <p>At breakfast the next morning, Estella looked the table at Eugene, and said,
                  "Well?"</p>
               <p>"I have done as you wished," he replied, "and remember that whatever happens, it
                  is your fault."</p>
               <p>"'Thou can'st not say I did it," she laughingly replied.</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6609-00000073"/>
               <p>"They received invitations to dinner, that day, at one of Eugene's old friend's.
                  They went, and on returning, found Grant Wardleigh had been there, and gone away,
                  leaving word that he would call a few minutes in the morning, before he left for
                  the city.</p>
               <p>"Confound it!" said Eugene, when he heard it.</p>
               <p>For a minute Estella said nothing, but her face showed how disappointed she
                  was.</p>
               <p>"Eugene, you must see him to-night, and make him stay here until he leaves.
                  Remember, your time is precious, and whatever you do must be done quickly, or it
                  will be too late."</p>
               <p>"It is just five o'clock," said he, looking at his watch. "I have time to bring
                  him up to supper, it 1 can find him."</p>
               <p>As soon as Eugene had gone, Estella went to her room, and never did she pay such
                  attention to her toilet as she did that evening, for she was dressing with an aim,
                  now. She wore a heavy silk, trimmed in costly lace, not the least showy, but
                  elegant and 'plain, and in her ears and at her throat she wore corals that matched
                  the scarlet of her lips. She stood before the glass, apparently well pleased with
                  the result, for her face and hands looked very fair in the dark dress, relieved by
                  a bit of white lace.</p>
               <p>"Now, if he only comes," said she, walking up and down the floor. She heard a
                  clear, ringing laugh, and looking out of the window, saw Eugene and Grant
                  approaching the house, and her heart beat fast as the frank, manly face looked up
                  at her and bowed.</p>
               <p>"You are looking well, my dear," said Eugene's grandmother, Mrs. Sinclair, as
                  Estella passed through her room. "Is Mr. Wardleigh a particular friend of yours?"
                  she asked, smiling.</p>
               <p>"He is. You saw him to-day; how do you like him?"</p>
               <p>"He is very pleasant; has a fine open face, and I was much pleased with him. But
                  go, my dear, I hear Eugene's voice in the hall.'</p>
               <p>She welcomed him with a sweet smile, and something like a blush mantled her cheek
                  as he took her hand; her calm stoicism melted away under his genial smile. That
                  night she exerted every faculty—talked to him as she had never talked before,
                  while Eugene looked off with a cynical light in his eyes.</p>
               <p>"It is nearly twelve o'clock, Estella," said Eugene, at last. Grant is no doubt
                  very-fatigued, and I propose that we retire."</p>
               <p>"I had no idea it was so late. I am afraid I have tired you, Miss Estella, said
                  Grant."</p>
               <p>"Not at all; this has been a very pleasant evening."</p>
               <p>"Come, make yourself at home," said Eugene, pushing him an easy chair before the
                  fire, "and decide to stay over to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Could not, possibly. I am so very busy."</p>
               <p>"Estella says you are becoming quite popular. Oh! by the way, I had several new
                  books sent to me the other day. One of them contains a severe criticism on
                  Blanchard's last work. Let me show it to you," and he drew up a, small, carved
                  stand and took from it a book, being careful as he did so, to drop from it, at
                  Grant's feet, one of Cora's letters. Grant, of course, stooped to pick it up, the
                  handwriting attracting his attention.</p>
               <p>"Do you get letters from Cora?" he asked, while his<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000074"/> eyes opened wide with astonishment.</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, did you not know that? But how should you; I have not given you
                  my confidence of late. Read it, and let it explain, for I feel too indolent to
                  repeat it."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you. She would not care to have me."</p>
               <p>"Not when I give you my permission? It would be no breach of confidence."</p>
               <p>Grant hesitated a moment, then slowly unfolded the letter as if deliberating
                  something in his mind. At last he read, and his face turned ashy pale. He took a
                  letter from his pocket, compared the two, then laid it down in silence, and picked
                  up the book.</p>
               <p>"Cool way to treat me. I think I deserve your congratulations."</p>
               <p>"Hardly; you might have told me before."</p>
               <p>"Positively, this is the first time I have had a chance."</p>
               <p>"Show me what you wished me to read," said he, coolly, changing the subject, "then
                  we will retire."</p>
               <p>What the result of this manœuver would be, he could not tell, but he did know that
                  there was a terrible struggle going on in his heart, and that love and confidence
                  had received a powerful blow. He took no notice of this sudden change; it was no
                  part of his to do so. But that night his heart smote him for what he had done,
                  when from the lips of Grant there came the cry of Cora. Ah! even in his dreams,
                  his honest, generous heart was being torn by a thousand conflicting emotions, that
                  his once trusted friend, and for aught he knew, still trusted friend, had
                  caused.</p>
               <p>Estella arose early the next morning,[and when Eugene came down the stairs, she
                  caught turn by the arm an eager, questioning light in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I have done it," he said, in answer to her look, then he pushed her away rudely,
                  impatiently, as if he loathed her.</p>
               <p>She walked away surprised, mortified, for she did not expect to see that sullen
                  look upon his face.</p>
               <p>If a man truly loves, and the object of his affection be a true, noble woman, it
                  cannot but shed a good influence over him. Estella did not know how much good
                  Cora's words had done, for he hated her, hated himself, because he had been so
                  weak as to commit such a deed.</p>
               <p>Estella had dressed for effect in the evening, so had she this morning. Perhaps
                  she had never appeared to better advantage than she did in the blue dress she
                  wore, which contrasted well with the dazzling pearl and rose of her complexion.
                  But it was all lost on Grant. No stone image could have been more unconscious of
                  beauty or taste than he was at the time. She was somewhat awed when he met her at
                  breakfast, for his face was very pale, betokening a night of pain and unrest. She
                  was kind but asked no questions. "Tell Cora, she said, when he bade her good bye,
                  "that I sent my love."</p>
               <p>He bowed low. He probably would not see Miss (Cora, but if he did, he would
                  deliver her message. She 'gave a little look of surprise, that was all, knowing
                  that the first scene was over, but when would come the <q>

               <p>"A letter, Miss Cora," said a servant, entering the I room where she and Minnie
                  were sitting.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6609-00000075"/>
               <p>"Cora!" came quickly from Minnie's lips, and she picked up a crystal gobiet and
                  dashed the contents in her face, for she was ashy pale, and clinging to a chair
                  for support, while the letter the servant had given her but a moment ago, was
                  lying at her feet.</p>
               <p>"I am not fainting, Minnie," said Cora, wiping the water from her face.</p>
               <p>"You looked as if you were. What was in that letter to hurt you so?"</p>
               <p>"Don't ask me," said Cora, picking up the letter, and putting it in her pocket,
                  "for I cannot tell you."</p>
               <p>Minnie asked no questions, for she knew it would be useless.</p>
               <p>Cora went to her room, and once more drew out the letter, as if to make sure it
                  was not all some terrible dream.</p>

                              another. You were my first love and will be my last. Being deceived in
                              one woman whom I thought an angel, is enough; I ask for no further

               <p>"She is not well, and did not wish any dinner."</p>
               <p>"I will go up and see her," said he, in spite of her protest against it.</p>
               <p>"My daughter, what is the matter?" asked he, when he entered the room and found
                  her weeping.</p>
               <p>She raised her tear-stained face, and with a cry threw herself into her father's
                  arms.</p>
               <p>"Tell me all, my child," said he, kindly.</p>
               <p>For an answer, she placed the note in his hand.</p>
               <p>His brow grew dark as he read. "There is some strange mistake here; let me see
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"No, father, he does not wish me to explain. He has lost his confidence in me, and
                  though I suffer deeply, I do not wish for love that could not trust through

               <p>"He is only jealous. Some one has misrepresented you to him."</p>

               <p>"I AM going home to-morrow," said Estella to Eugene, one morning, after reading a
                  letter from home.</p>
               <p>"What for?"</p>
               <p>"Mother has written, it is rumored that the, engagement between Grant and Cora is
                  broken off."</p>
               <p>"Is it not what you expected?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and now it is time to work for my interest."</p>
               <p>"And that is what you have been working for, all the while. I don't think you
                  consulted my interest at all."</p>
               <p>"Have you not a good chance of winning, too? It<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000076"/> will be your own fault, if you do not succeed."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so," said he, drily.</p>
               <p>"Cora is as free as Grant. They are both our friends; are not our chances
                  equal?"</p>
               <p>"No, for I cannot see her."</p>
               <p>"You can come to New York."</p>
               <p>"I would not like to. She would think it strange that I knew her engagement was
                  broken."</p>
               <p>"Not at all. As soon as I go home I will call and tell her I have heard the
                  report, and express my surprise She will tell me all about it, and will think, of
                  course that I have told you. After being in New York a few days, we can call
                  together, and after that you can call alone. You will know from the manner in
                  which she treats you, how to proceed."</p>
               <p>"I dislike to go back, for I bade Cora adieu forever, and told Grant that I would
                  leave for Europe, in the spring."</p>
               <p>"You can tell them you have changed your mind. I am surprised to find you so
                  faint-hearted. You was not so once. Any one that has made love to as many ladies
                  as you, ought not to come to me for advice."</p>
               <p>"Making love in fun and making love in earnest are two very different things,
                  Estella."</p>
               <p>"I suppose so, but I do not think you will have any trouble, even if it be a case
                  of true love, and if you do, the end will justify it."</p>
               <p>"Shall I go home with you?" he asked, at length.</p>
               <p>"You could not have a better excuse, and then it would keep mother quiet."</p>
               <p>"Estella is going home to-morrow, and I am going with her, grandmother," said
                  Eugene, entering her room, a few minutes after his conversation with Estella.</p>
               <p>"Are you coming back to me, Eugene?"</p>
               <p>"Not soon, I think."</p>
               <p>"I am so sorry. If I could only be near you always! It is selfishness in me to
                  even wish that you might prefer this little village to the city. But your mother
                  with her latest breath gave you to me. Oh! you know not how, earnestly I have
                  prayed that you might not be led into temptation, for I felt that I could not meet
                  your mother and know that I had failed to do my duty by her child. I am growing
                  old, Eugene—ere you return I may be laid to rest. Try and do right; try to do as
                  you think your angel mother would wish you to, and strive to meet her in
                  heaven."</p>
               <p>Eugene's heart was touched, when he saw the tears gliding down her wrinkled
                  cheeks, and all his broken resolutions arose before him. Why had he not kept them?
                  Why had he given up his peace of mind? Ah yes, why?</p>
               <p>"Grandmother, I am not worthy of your prayers; do not waste them on me. You do not
                  know how wicked I have been."</p>
               <p>"No, Eugene, I know nothing comparatively about your past life, but be it as it
                  may, shall never cease praying for you, never give up the hope that you will yet
                  be gathered into the fold."</p>
               <p>Eugene was silent, for he knew how useless were her prayers, how useless were her
                  hopes, yet he would not pain her patient heart by telling her so.</p>
               <p>"You have been a good, dear grandmother to me," said he, respectfully touching his
                  lips to the hand that lay on his own, "and I hope that you may live to a good<pb
                     n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6609-00000077"/> old age, and that I may spend many
                  pleasant weeks here before you are laid to rest."</p>
               <p>"I know that I have not long to live, Eugene, for I feel myself failing day by
                  day. It is not an unpleasant thought to know that the Master will soon call me,
                  for one by one they have all passed away—all that were near and dear to me. But
                  you remain, and' you will soon marry and form new ties, and will not miss your old
                  grandmother."</p>
               <p>"Yes, grandmother, I would miss you, and no one's death would cause me as much
                  grief as yours."</p>
               <p>"Has Eugene been a bad boy, grandmother, and have you been telling him of his
                  naughtiness?" asked Estella, entering the room.</p>
               <p>"No, I never think he is a bad boy. We have been talking of the past, and of his
                  mother." "Ah," said Estella.</p>
               <p>"Come and walk down to the village, Eugene; I have an errand there," said she,
                  after a time.</p>
               <p>Eugene obeyed reluctantly, for he felt as if she always came to banish his good
                  impulses. But out from his grandmother's presence, out into the cold, sharp air,
                  and Estella by his side, laughing at his sober face, his conscience was soon
                  hushed.</p>
               <p>"You used to preach to me about honor and truth, Estella, and pharisee-like stand
                  off and say 'I am better than thou,' but how bravely you have gotten over it all,"
                  said Eugene, scornfully, for he was not pleased to, hear her ridicule him for
                  being touched at his grandmother's words.</p>
               <p>"Circumstances always alter cases. I am "aware I am not the girl I was once."</p>
               <p>"Then don't laugh when another has a sober thought, Estella."</p>
               <p>"What good does your sober thoughts—as you call them—do you when you are going
                  straight to make mischief?"</p>
               <p>"I would spoil your prospects, if it were not for, proving my falseness to
                  Grant."</p>
               <p>"I would not stop for such a small consideration," said Estella, ironically.</p>
               <p>Eugene frowned and was silent, but he felt as if he would like to have boxed her
                  ears, soundly. Estella smiled to herself, because he dared make no outcry, let her
                  be as tantalizing as she pleased.</p>
               <p>"Do not look so much like clouds in November," said Estella to Eugene, that
                  evening, and I will tell you what mother says in a postscript to her letter, that
                  I overlooked in the hasty reading that was given it, this morning. She said that
                  she met Cora, the day before she wrote, and that she enquired after you very
                  kindly. You see that she has not forgotten you, at least. There is something else
                  I have to say to you. You know why mother was so anxious to have me come here, and
                  when we return you must appear very devoted to me before her, or she will have old
                  Mr. Claymore visiting me."</p>
               <p>"You need not see him against your will."</p>
               <p>"No, but it is unpleasant to | be forever quarreling about it. She is determined
                  to get rid of me."</p>
               <p>"Sensible woman," said Eugene, interrupting her. Estella went on, and did not heed
                  his remark. "And unless she thinks there is some prospect of my marrying you, she
                  will never give me any peace until I have Mr. Claymore."</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6609-00000078"/>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard was delighted to find that Eugene had returned with Estella, and she
                  drew her aside, telling her that she had done a sensible thing for once, and that
                  he would make her a much better husband than Mr. Claymore.</p>
               <p>"So I thought," said Estella.</p>
               <p>"It is very pleasant to have you with us again, Eugene. Do you intend remaining
                  all winter?" said Mrs. Brainard.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and probably longer, if I do not go to Europe in the spring. Estella has
                  almost persuaded me out of the notion," said Eugene, glancing across the room at
                  Estella, who sat reading by the fire.</p>
               <p>"Has she? It was very kind in you to comply with her request," said Mrs. Brainard,
                  well pleased.</p>
               <p>Eugene guessed her thoughts, and smiled secretly at her mistake.</p>
               <p>"I sent word to Cora that I was at home, and to come and stay all the evening,"
                  said Estella to Eugene, the next day. "She has sent word back that she had an
                  engagement, but would call this afternoon. When you think she has been here long
                  to tell me her troubles, you can come in, and probably she will invite you to
                  call. I want you to do a favor for me, now that I have planned this for you.
                  Probably it will be weeks before I can see Grant, and you must get him to call
                  to-morrow evening? but at the same time, be careful not to let him know that I am
                  anxious about it."</p>
               <p>"I am puzzled, Estella, to know how you are going to proceed, after you do meet
                  him. He knew that Cora told you she was engaged to him; he will know also that you
                  have heard the rumor that it is broken off. Knowing all this, and that I am your
                  cousin and she your most intimate friend, won't he think it strange that you did
                  not know that I was engaged to her?"</p>
               <p>"No; for I will tell him you never gave him your confidence, and that Cora kept
                  the truth from me because she knew my mother was resolved that I should marry you.
                  Only get him here—that is all I ask of you."</p>
               <p>"Dear Cora I how glad I am to see you!" said Estella that afternoon, when Cora
                  came. "It has been such a long while since I saw you. You look pale; have you been
                  sick?"</p>
               <p>"No, but not as well as usual."</p>
               <p>"What has become of Grant and Gerald?" asked Estella, at length.</p>
               <p>"Gerald still waits on Minnie. They will be married soon."</p>
               <p>"Are you not going to marry at the same time?"</p>
               <p>"I shall not marry at all," said Cora, sadly.</p>
               <p>"Grant is angry with me."</p>
               <p>"Grant angry? That is so unlike him. What have you done?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing that I know of. I received a brief note from, him, just after he returned
                  home, saying that henceforth it would be best that we remain as strangers, and
                  that it was not necessary for him to explain, or for me to make any excuses. Did
                  he say anything to you?"</p>
               <p>"He said nothing about being angry with you, nor was he angry, for when I
                  congratulated him he told me that he was as happy as it was possible for man to
                  be. Why not ask him, Cora, what you have done to offend him."</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6609-00000079"/>
               <p>"He told me, you remember, to make no excuses, and I am too proud to do so, but
                  Estella, you do not know what a heavy heart it has made me carryall this
                  while."</p>
               <p>"My dear friend, I am truly sorry for you. I wish it were in my power to make you
                  happy. But never mind; every thing happens for the best. All will come right yet.
                  If Grant really loved you, he will return."</p>
               <p>Eugene just then opened the door and came in.</p>
               <p>Cora sprang up and held out her hand, saying, "Estella, why did you not tell me
                  that he was here?"</p>
               <p>"I wanted to surprise you, for I had such a time in getting him to consent to
                  come."</p>
               <p>"Are you "going to remain all the winder in the city?"</p>
               <p>"I really cannot tell, Miss Cora," he replied.</p>
               <p>"I must go, Estella, for father will have a friend to dinner and I have to be
                  there. You both must call."</p>
               <p>"Give Grant my compliments when you see him tonight, and tell him that I am coming
                  down to his office in the morning," said Eugene, when he put Cora into her
                  carriage.</p>
               <p>"I shall not see Grant; he does not call on me any more."</p>
               <p>"Why, are you not engaged to him?"</p>
               <p>"Not now."</p>
               <p>"May 1 call on you then?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. You are my friend, and will at any time."</p>
               <p>"May I call to-morrow evening?" he asked, at a venture.</p>
               <p>"I have an engagement then; you, may call the next."</p>
               <p>Eugene bowed and left her, and went Mown to Grant Wardleigh's office, but he was
                  not there. "It don't matter much," thought Eugene, "whether she sees him or not I
                  have had to bear all her taunts, and commit all the crime, and I think deserve all
                  the gain."</p>
               <p>"Grant was not at his office, Estella," said Eugene, on his return. "I will go
                  again in the morning. I have made an engagement with Cora, for Thursday
                  evening."</p>
               <p>"You are progressing nicely; but do not call too often at first, for she may
                  suspect your love, and put an end to it."</p>
               <p>"What was she talking about when I came in?"</p>
               <p>"About Grant Wardleigh. He never explained, nor would he let her explain, which is
                  fortunate for us both."</p>
               <p>"Well, Estella, it is doubtful whether I can get him here; he would give me no
                  positive answer."</p>
               <p>"How did he treat you?"</p>
               <p>"Rather coolly. I don't suppose he ever will be the friend tome again that he has
                  been."</p>
               <p>"You ought not to expect it."</p>
               <p>"Grant has come," said Eugene, tapping on Estella's door that evening. "Make the
                  most of it! for I don't thing I can get him here again. He seems very
                  despondent."</p>
               <p>Estella went down into the parlor, and for the first time found Grant Wardleigh
                  hard to entertain. He was quiet and answered everything in monosyllables. Estella
                  was almost in despair, but was determined to gain her point.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wardleigh," said Estella, "I am afraid you think I was aware of the
                  engagement that existed between<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6609-00000080"/> tween
                  my cousin and Cora Benoir, when I congratulated you. Cora told me she was engaged
                  to you, and I did not know it was otherwise until to-day: then Eugene told
                  met."</p>
               <p>"No, Estella, I never thought you knew of the engagement."</p>
               <p>"I have often wondered why Cora told me what she did. She must have been afraid to
                  tell me the truth, because she knew my mother was anxious that Eugene and I should
                  marry. Who would have thought. Cora would have told an untruth?"</p>
               <p>"I would not," he replied, briefly, and all attempts were unavailing to make him
                  speak of Cora, again.</p>
               <p>"You are not going?" said Eugene, coming in, and finding Grant ready to
                  depart.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it ten o'clock."</p>
               <p>"I trust this is but the commencement of many pleasant evenings like this," said
                  Estella.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I shall be pleased to call again.</p>
               <p>"Well, Estella, how are you succeeding?" asked Eugene, after Grant had left.</p>
               <p>"Very well, considering how full his heart is of Cora. It will take him some time
                  to live down his love."</p>

               <p>"WHERE are you going, Cora?" asked Minnie.</p>
               <p>"To see my seamstress, who is sick, said she filling a small basket full of
                  delicacies, to take along with her.</p>
               <p>"You are looking more cheerful than usual."</p>
               <p>"To do a kindly errand makes me cheerful."</p>
               <p>"I thought perhaps you had seen Grant."</p>
               <p>"No," said she, sadly.</p>
               <p>"I would forget him, Cora."</p>
               <p>"Oh, if it were possible!" thought Cora, as she walked down the street, "for my
                  heart which was once full freighted with the fondest hopes woman ever cherished,
                  now lies crushed" and dying. Dreary indeed, would be my lot, if I had but one
                  hope, one aim, but there still remains for me the pleasure of making others happy,
                  if I am not happy myself." Her walk was soon ended, and going into the house, she
                  found Grant Wardleigh talking to the seamstress about some work. For a moment her
                  heart beat violently, and a faint flush spread over her face, then she bowed, and
                  took the chair he offered her. Grant took up his hat and gloves to leave. As he
                  passed Cora, the small seal he wore on his watch-chain became unfastened and fell
                  at her feet. She picked it up and gave it to him; as she did so, he glanced into
                  the violet eyes, with their tender pleading look. Oh, how he longed to take her in
                  his arms, kiss away the look of grief, and crush down the barrier the letters had
                  raised between them, by telling her all. Then there arose before him Eugene's
                  triumphant laugh as he gave him the letter, and Estella's confirmation of the
                  engagement. He drew on his gloves and walked resolutely away, heedless of the
                  disappointed look in her face. But as he waited home, the good angel came down and
                  stirred the depths of his heart. "Oh, my darling I" he murmured to himself, "I
                  cannot believe that you have been untrue<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6609-00000081"
                  /> true, cannot believe that your pure, open face hides deceit. This must all be
                  some strange mistake, and if you are at the party to-night, I will know the truth
                  from your own lips."</p>
               <p>"You have got the blues again," said Minnie to Cora, just after she had returned,
                  "and have seen Grant, I know. Come to the party to-night—the excitement will make
                  you forget your trouble.</p>
               <p>"I will go."</p>
               <p>"That is right. I would not grieve for any one, no, not even for such a paragon as
                  Grant."</p>
               <p>"I declare if there is not Grant. Wardleigh, and he has not been to a party for an
                  age," whispered Minnie to Cora, at the party that night. "I must speak to
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Grant, what is the matter?" asked Minnie, tapping him on the arm with her fan.
                  "You look as though you had lost your best friend."</p>
               <p>"Did my face indeed look so doleful, as to have attracted your attention, Miss
                  Minnie?" he asked, with a faint attempt at a smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I could guess the cause. You are jealous,; Cora is proud, and you are
                  both silly. Come make it all up;" and before Grant hardly knew it, she had let him
                  to Cora's side, saying, "This is your place," then she was off like a meteor
                  flash.</p>
               <p>"Grant had to smile in spite of himself and he "offered Cora his arm, which she,
                  with a look of surprise, took "I am much obliged to Minnie for what she has done,"
                  said Grant, for I came here with the determination to know the truth. I can not
                  stand it any longer. I cannot believe you untrue, and yet—"</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Grant," said Eugene Tracy, at his side, for he had been watching
                  them, and was not going to let his prey be snatched away in that manner. "I am
                  glad you concluded to come. Our hostess deserves, great credit for drawing
                  Diogones away from his tub; don't you think so, Miss Cora?"</p>
               <p>She merely bowed. Eugene Tracy's presence was un-welcome then. She wondered what
                  Grant was going to say to her—would he explain? "He says that he cannot believe I
                  am untrue. Has any one told him that I was untrue? Could it have been Estella?"
                  All this she pondered over, as she stood there. "No, no," she thought, "Estella
                  cares too much for my happiness to injure me in any way."</p>
               <p>"Cora, there is a bust of Clytie, in the library, that I—wish to show you. It was
                  executed by a friend of mine, now in Italy. Grant will excuse you, I know," said
                  Eugene.</p>
               <p>There was nothing else for her to do but go with Eugene; but if Grant had glanced
                  into her face, he would have seen how it displeased her. As it was, he thought she
                  preferred Eugene's society to his, and took that method to keep from confessing
                  her deceit, and he walked moodily away, never thinking how unreasonable his
                  thoughts were. Cora, after admiring the Clytie, came away, for she hoped Grant
                  would finish the explanation that her heart was aching to know; but when she again
                  entered the room, Grant had joined Estella, and during the rest of the evening he
                  did not approach her.</p>
               <p>"Grant came very near putting an end to our little affair to-night; did you see
                  them together?" said Eugene to Estella, after the party,</p>
               <p>"Yes; it was Minnie's doing—I saw her bring him<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000082"/> over to Cora, and was about to rush to the rescue
                  myself when you came. You don't think he told her anything?</p>
               <p>"No; I did not give him time. Cora flashed her blue eyes at me for my pains, and I
                  have no doubt she would have preferred Grant's conversation to seeing a piece of
                  marble."</p>
               <p>"You must be careful and not give him another such an opportunity," said
                  Estella.</p>
               <p>"And you must make him more suspicious, or he will have an understanding with her,
                  in spite of us."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if he really cares for her yet?"</p>
               <p>"I know that he does. Last week, while at the concert, when you and Cora came' in,
                  he grasped his opera-glass in a way that showed his feelings were aroused."</p>
               <p>"If that is the case, Estella, are! you not afraid you' will never succeed in
                  making him love you? You know <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"It is better to be off with the old love</l>
                        <l>Before you are on with the new."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I can wait. He cannot always cling to Cora, when he knows he cannot marry her. He
                  but rarely speaks of her, and when he does I infer he thinks she has been trying
                  to flirt with him, and you know Grant can forgive anything better than
                  deceit."</p>
               <p>"Well, that is rich! The idea of her flirting! Why, she would not say any thing
                  she did, not mean, under any circumstances. I call her Saint Agnes, all the
                  time."</p>
               <p>"Does she appear as indifferent toward you as ever?"</p>
               <p>"One could hardly say that she is indifferent. She is very friendly, and sometimes
                  her words make me think she regards me with even more than friendly interest. I
                  hardly know what to think, but it is evident that she is very unhappy."</p>
               <p>"Will Mr. Wardleigh call again to night?" asked Mrs. Brainard of Estella, the
                  night after the party.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Won't Eugene object to his calling so often?"</p>
               <p>"We understand each other," she replied, coldly.</p>
               <p>"I have reason to think," said Mrs. Brainard, looking at her sharply, "that you
                  have not gotten over your penchant for Mr. Wardleigh. You are very silly, Estella,
                  for he will never love you."</p>
               <p>Estella smiled scornfully in reply, as she left the room, for she was as certain
                  she would gain his love, as she was that she existed.</p>

               <p>"FATHER," said Cora, one morning, "I am going to visit Mrs. Gray."</p>
               <p>"Who is Mrs. Gray?"</p>
               <p>"My old friend, Ida Nathan."</p>
               <p>"What made you think of going there?" asked Minnie, after Mr. Benoir had left the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"The letter I received from Ida this morning, and I am feeling so low spirited
                  that a visit will do me good."</p>
               <p>"Any one that is as proud as you are, ought to feel low spirited. I declare, you
                  and Grant put me out of all patience."</p>

               <p>"What is the use of putting myself in a humiliating position for no purpose?"</p>
               <p>"None," she replied, ironically.</p>
               <p>It was no part of Minnie's nature to suffer long. She believed in the philosophy,
                  that <q>

               <p>No imaginary sorrow ever troubled her, and Cora's sorrow was half imaginary, she
                  knew. It was provoking to see her drift along in this silent grief,, when perhaps
                  a few words would make all right, and she grew half angry at Cora, for hushing her
                  when ever she attempted to speak about it.</p>
               <p>"I would not be surprised to see you silly enough to marry Eugene Tracy, in the
                  end," said Minnie.</p>
               <p>"Marry Eugene Tracy? never!"</p>
               <p>"Then you are a flirt."</p>
               <p>"Minnie!" said she, in an injured tone.</p>
               <p>"Well, does it not look-like it? You encourage him in his visits, and yet, say you
                  would not marry him."</p>
               <p>"He looks upon me only as a friend."</p>
               <p>"Friend! nonsense! He thinks his coming will keep Grant away, and in the meantime,
                  he will have a chance of winning you himself."</p>
               <p>"Grant is his most intimate friend, and he would not wrong him. He knows it would
                  be vain to think of winning my love, for I have told him so, long ago."</p>
               <p>"Suppose you have. As long as you let him call on you, he will hope."</p>
               <p>"But he has not spoken of love this season."</p>
               <p>"No, he will bide his time."</p>
               <p>Cora had not thought of all this before. She supposed he had banished all such
                  sentiments when she rejected him, and even now, when she looked back over the last
                  few months, she could not see that he had been the least lover-like. She thought
                  he had sought her society because it was unpleasant at his aunt's. She had told
                  Grant she cared nothing for Eugene, and his coming could not keep him away.</p>
               <p>"I am going to visit Mrs. Gray," said Gray, when Eugene came that evening.</p>
               <p>"Shall you stay long?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Probably all the summer."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Cora," said he, with a disappointed look on his face, "you don't know how I
                  shall miss you."</p>
               <p>"Of course, I shall expect you to miss me a little at first, but you will forget
                  me before the season is over."</p>
               <p>"You know better, Cora," said he in a tone that she could not mistake.</p>
               <p>"Where will you spend the summer?" she asked, pretending not to have noticed what
                  he said.</p>
               <p>"I do not know," he replied, briefly. He was angry to see Cora so indifferent in
                  leaving him.</p>
               <p>Cora then changed the subject, and. gave him no opportunity of pressing his suit,
                  even if he desired to.</p>

               <p>"Grant, my dear fellow, what is the matter?" asked Gerald Lingle, coming into his
                  office one day, and finding him with his head bowed on the table.</p>
               <p>He raised his head with a weary look, and said, "Perhaps I am grieving because you
                  are a Judge, while I who<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6609-00000084"/> have plodded
                  along so patiently, am nothing but a poor lawyer."</p>
               <p>"That is not it," said Gerald. "Is it not something about Cora? Tell me, my
                  friend, and let me help you."</p>
               <p>"If it were anything you could help me in, you should know it," said Grant, sadly,
                  thinking how useless it was to try to restore broken confidence and lost faith.
                  False as he thought her, he could not help loving her. Eugene was so handsome, so
                  fascinating, and Cora loved him once. Perhaps she had deceived herself in thinking
                  her old love dead, and when she met him, it revived. Thus he argued. But oh, if
                  she only had been honest, only had told met the truth, I would have given her up
                  without an unkind thought."</p>
               <p>"Where are your thoughts—in the clouds?" asked Gerald, as Grant sat gazing out of
                  the window, at a line of white, fleecy mist. "Ah, this accounts for it," said he,
                  picking up a volume of Ruskin, that lay on the table.</p>
               <p>"Do you know that Miss Cora leaves New York, tomorrow?" asked Gerald, at
                  length.</p>
               <p>"No, where is she going?"</p>
               <p>"To Princeton, to visit Mrs. Gray. I am going to' call on her this evening; come,
                  go with me."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you."</p>
               <p>"As there is no prospect of getting you to consent to go with me, I may as well
                  leave you," said Gerald.</p>
               <p>"As soon as he left the office, Grant once more bowed his head on the table, and
                  sat there until the daylight faded, and the sombre shadows of night gathered
                  around him. Never had he felt so miserable, or so alone. Bitter indeed had been
                  the moment when he bade farewell to the loved ones, as they passed away from
                  earth, but far more bitter to say farewell forever to hope and happiness, to know
                  that the one he had trusted, confided in, was unworthy of his affections. Gerald
                  thought him proud, unreasonable, he knew, but he did not know all, nor would he
                  tell him tie chose to suffer alone, rather than by word or deed give others reason
                  to think less of Cora.</p>
               <p>"Grant, are you asleep?" asked Judge Glynn, coming into the office, and finding
                  him sitting there in the dark. "It is seven o'clock; time you were going to
                  supper, my boy."</p>
               <p>"Grant took his hat and left the office, but instead of going to the hotel, turned
                  his steps in the direction of the avenue, on which Cora lived, and the policeman
                  on his beat, half an hour later, saw a tall, portly figure, with folded arms, pace
                  up and down before a house that was brilliantly lighted, for, unknown to Cora, a
                  gay party had assembled there to say good bye. Grant watched the figures flit
                  through the rooms, and once noticed Cora and Eugene standing by one of the windows
                  as he broken spray of ivy that climbed about it, and place it in her hair. She
                  smiled, and taking his arm, walked away. It was enough for the lonely watcher on
                  the walk, and he hastened from the scene. Cora little thought that night of the
                  suffering he was passing through; if she had, Grant would have awakened the next
                  morning to find his fondest hopes realized, for she would not have closed her eyes
                  until he had known the truth.</p>
               <p>"If you get sick, or need me in any way, you must' not fail to send for me," said
                  Cora, a short time before she was to leave, addressing her father.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6609-00000085"/>
               <p>"You shall be notified in due time," said he, passing his hand caressingly over
                  her hair.</p>
               <p>While Cora was awaiting the train, a tall, muffled figure passed her, and when
                  nearing her destination, she saw, sitting in the cars a few seats behind her, the
                  same person that had attracted her attention at the depot. Looking into his face,
                  as she arose to leave the car, she recognized Grant Wardleigh. Had he followed her
                  as a spy, or because he cared for her, she wondered.</p>
               <p>He caught hold of her dress as she was about to pass out of the door, and when she
                  looked up in surprise, he held out his hand, and said, "I have come to say good
                  bye."</p>
               <p>Was it necessary to come all this way to say it?" she asked, piqued at his strange
                  behavior.</p>
               <p>"No," and he abruptly turned and left her.</p>
               <p>She repented her words as soon as spoken, but she had no time to recall them, for
                  the conductor lifted her out on the platform, the bell rang, and the cars rattled
                  off.</p>
               <p>Grant strode back in the car, and sat down in the seat he had vacated. When they
                  arrived at the next station, he got out; and instead of going back to New York,
                  took the train for his home in Brighton.</p>
               <p>His parents, surprised to see him, were alarmed at his pale face, but to their
                  many questions he replied, "I am not sick; only tired, and I thought that a few
                  hours at home would do me good."</p>
               <p>Old Aunt Chloe was delighted to find that Grant was home again, and asked why he
                  had not brought Cora with him, as he had promised.</p>
               <p>"I did not ask her to come, Chloe, and if I had, I suppose she would have
                  refused."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wardleigh heard his reply, and thought she had discovered the cause of his
                  pale face.</p>
               <p>"I shall leave on the noon train," said Grant, the next morning.</p>
               <p>"So soon?" asked she, sorrowfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes; when I started, I had no idea of coming here. Judge, Glynn does not know
                  where I am, and we are very busy at present. I shall be here again, soon."</p>
               <p>When leaving, he took the path that led through the orchard and the grove—the same
                  that Cora and he had strolled up and down, the summer before. Each word and look
                  that he recalled, smote him for doubting her; and yet how could he help it, after
                  seeing that fatal letter? He walked on through the graveyard, and leaned over the
                  iron railing that enclosed the family burying ground. Sad thoughts thronged around
                  him as he stood there, looking on the mounds from whence the whit shafts pointed
                  heavenward, for all but he were gone and to him existence had ceased to be
                  enjoyable. There he felt that it was not manly to be so unnerved, and recalled to
                  his mind the words of the sage who said, "Only women and weak-minded men mourn
                  over disappointed love." But he could not shake off this feeling of despondency
                  where every object reminded him of Cora.</p>
               <p>Grant resolved, as he went back on the train, that he would try no more to have an
                  understanding with Cora; he would banish her from his thoughts and give his whole
                  mind and energies' to his profession. How well he succeeded in this resolve,
                  remains to be told; but knowing the effect of this estrangement, you may
                  guess!</p>

               <p>SUMMER had come and was nearly gone, and Cora was still visiting her friend.
                  Eugene did not go to any summer resort. He was tired of drifting here and there;
                  tired of leading such an aimless life, and felt disgusted with himself and all the
                  world, he said.</p>
               <p>"I shall not live between hopes and fears, any longer," said Eugene, to Estella,
                  one day. "I am going to see Cora, and know my fate."</p>
               <p>"Don't be rash."</p>
               <p>"It she does not love me now, she never will. 'As ye sow, even so shall ye reap'
                  Estella we have sown evil; how can we expect to reap good?"</p>
               <p>"Don't moralize," said she, impatiently, "it is not your mission."</p>
               <p>"What is my mission?"</p>
               <p>"Whatever you excel in."</p>

               <p>"True."</p>
               <p>"But I am not satisfied with my mission, then; it has proved a burden."</p>
               <p>'You bear it very philosophically, if it has. When do you propose going to
                  Cora."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, for I am in a hurry to know the truth. It is rumored at the club,
                  Estella, that you are engaged to Grant Wardleigh. Is it so?"</p>
               <p>"No; not engaged to him; but judging from his manner, I shall not be surprised to
                  receive a proposal of marriage very soon."</p>
               <p>"Twelve o'clock the next day, found Eugene speeding over hill and valley, en route
                  for Princeton. Later, it was with feelings of sadness that he walked up the
                  familiar streets, and saw the walls of the old college, rising out of the trees.
                  Ah, how things had changed since he walked those streets a student!</p>
               <p>As he approached the residence of Mrs. Gray, he saw Cora standing among the trees,
                  arranging a boquet.</p>
               <p>She uttered a little cry, and said in a tone, that sounded like displeasure, "Why,
                  Eugene, what brings you here?"</p>
               <p>"You of course, Cora; what else could?"</p>
               <p>She turned away her face, and he could not see if his words had displeased her.
                  After a moment's silence, she said, "Come into the house. Ida will be delighted to
                  see you, for, I believe, she once numbered you among her best friends."</p>
               <p>"No, I do not wish to go in until I know my fate Cora you must know that I never
                  relinquished the hope that you might love me."</p>
               <p>"I thought that question had been Answered, satisfactorily some time ago," she
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"But you are not engaged to Grant now."</p>
               <p>"No; yet I shall never cease loving him."</p>
               <p>"Then you cannot care for me?" he asked, sadly.</p>
               <p>"As a dear friend—nothing more. Why not be content?"</p>
               <p>"Because I love, and need you, Cora. You could purify my nature, and help me lead

               <p>"Banish you from my thoughts! Ah, that is so easily said, but not so Easily done,"

               <p>"You are not going?" asked she, laying her hand on his arm, as he moved away.</p>
               <p>"Yes; why should I stay?"</p>
               <p>She did not reply. "Remember, Eugene," she said at last, "that I am your true
                  friend. No man ever had a truer one, and let us part as such."</p>
               <p>He merely touched the hand she extended, then walked hastily away.</p>
               <p>Cora was grieved to think she had offended him, and for the moment almost wished
                  that she could love him.</p>
               <p>Eugene strode angrily to his hotel. Angry, because he had been drawn into a plan
                  that had resulted in no good to himself, and mortified because he had been
                  rejected. Fool, that I have been!" he exclaimed, "I might have known Estella only
                  planned this to benefit herself. I wish that not one of her hopes may be realized,
                  and that she may live to suffer; suffer as I am suffering," he cried. He tried to
                  hate Cora, but the pale, sweet face came before his mind; the face that had held
                  naught but pleasant smiles and kind words for him, and he could not do it. "She
                  loved me once, and I trifled with her; never caring how my neglect might hurt her.
                  It is but right that I should suffer now. What a weary life I have made Grant lead
                  for a year! I will return and tell him all; let him hate me if he will. I shall go
                  away then, where none will ever hear of me."</p>
               <p>A little girl opposite his window commented playing. "Home, Sweet Home." It took
                  him back to his youthful days. Memories of his father and mother clustered around
                  him. "Oh, would to Heaven that I were a boy again! I would give anything to be
                  able to retrace my steps and stand here pure as that child in heart and
                  principle." He felt as if he could have wept bitter tears of grief and remorse for
                  his wasted life. It is a sorrowful thing to stand face to face with one's own soul
                  and know it to be worthy of something so much higher and better, and yet find it
                  is merely a charnel-house filled with the dead hopes and high aspirations of long
                  ago.</p>
               <p>At midnight Eugene was on the train,: homeward bound. Oh, that some good angel had
                  told him to delay until the morning, for surely and swiftly he was going to meet
                  his doom. The stars looked serenely down on the quiet beauty of the landscape over
                  which the cars dashed, and the passengers were dozing in their seats, with no
                  thought of the danger that awaited them which suddenly there came a crash, the
                  cars bounded, pitched forward, and amid shrieks and screams, went down, down to
                  the bottom of a precipice, with dead, dying and wounded among the ruins of the
                  train.</p>
               <p>"You are seriously injured, and if you have any word to send to friends, better do
                  so immediately," said a physician to Eugene Tracy, when he awakened to
                  consciousness and found himself almost crushed to death, in a farm house, near
                  where the accident happened.</p>
               <p>"I have two friends I wish to send for," said he, faintly.</p>
               <p>The doctor took their address and asked what he should tell them.</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6609-00000088"/>
               <p>"That I cannot live, and to come to me immediately."</p>
               <p>"Shall I send a minister to you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, the thoughts that crossed his mind as he lay there! The past with all its sin
                  loomed up before him, making a hell of his heart. He would not die! He would not
                  die! he shrieked aloud, and cursed God in his bitterness.</p>
               <p>"Here is a telegram for you, Cora," said Mrs. Gray, tapping on her door the next
                  morning.</p>
               <p>She hastily went to the door; a vauge fear possessing her, and her hands trembled
                  so she could hardly tear it open.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Ida, Eugene is dying!" she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Why, what is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"He was going home, and there was a collision. He has sent for me."</p>
               <p>"May I ask, Cora, if he is more than a friend?"</p>
               <p>"No, but I will not deny him this last request."</p>
               <p>Cora did not arrive at the house where Eugene was, until after Grant had. She was
                  surprised to see him there, and merely bowing, she knelt down by Eugene's bed,
                  gazed upon the face that looked as if Death had already set his seal there and
                  murmured, "My poor, dear friend!"</p>
               <p>A smile passed over his face, as she uttered these words.</p>
               <p>"Don't touch me I" he exclaimed in a tone that made her draw back, as she
                  attempted to take his hand. "You would sooner touch the vilest wretch on earth
                  than me, when you know all." "Grant, come here and kneel by Cora; I want to
                  confess what I have done, and make all the atonement I can."</p>
               <p>Grant complied, and Eugene lay a moment with closed eyes, as if gathering courage
                  to begin.</p>
               <p>"Grant, said he, "I once made Cora believe that I was honorable and true, and
                  strove by every art to make her love me, with no other purpose than to pass away
                  time, and to vex Estella and my aunt. When I had gained it, and found that her
                  father would soon return, and that I could trifle no longer, I left her to suffer,
                  as only a loving, trusting nature like hers can. After four years I met her again,
                  and learned to love her, but it was too late—you had won what I would have given
                  everything to have possessed. She had forgiven me all, and pleaded for me to be a
                  good, true man, and I went away resolved to keep the promise I had given her. But
                  while at my grandmother's, the notes Cora had written to me years before, were
                  placed in my hands. They tempted me, oh, you know not how strongly, and I yielded.
                  I changed the dates, and when you came, put them in your way, to arouse your
                  suspicion; arid succeeding in this, I went still further, and induced you to read
                  one, so that you might believe her untrue. You were jealous and proud; I knew you
                  would not explain; and I have tried to keep you apart—poisoned your mind with
                  hints, while I tried to win her love, but it was useless. Yesterday she again
                  refused me, saying that she would never cease loving you. I left Cora with my
                  heart full of anger, for home, but you see, am here."</p>
               <p>Cora was crying, but Grant gazed at him with a terrible look in his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Grant! forgive me," said he, pleadingly, "God? only knows how what suffering
                  it has caused me."</p>
               <p>But Grant did not reply, nor did the sternness pass<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000089"/> from his face.</p>
               <p>"Cora," said" Eugene, his dark eyes resting upon her, "dare I ask you, whom I have
                  twice injured, to forgive me?"</p>
               <p>Malice could find no place in Cora's heart. She only saw before her her erring
                  friend, whom she pitied but did not hate, and bending over him, she pressed a kiss
                  of forgiveness on his brow.</p>
               <p>A smile of grateful thanks passed over his face, but it changed to an expression
                  of pain as he glanced at Grant.</p>
               <p>"'But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
                  them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute
                  you, that ye may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven,'" slowly
                  repeated Cora. Then laying her hand softly on Grant's arm, she said, "Forgive
                  him."</p>
               <p>He hesitated a moment, and then said, "It has been a struggle, but I forgive you
                  all."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" Eugene exclaimed, with a look of relief.</p>
               <p>"Cora, will you forgive me?" asked Grant, turning to her his frank, open face,
                  full of grief and love.</p>
               <p>She looked at him with tears glistening in her eyes, and for an answer, rested her
                  head upon his breast and wept softly.</p>
               <p>Eugene turned away his head, for it was torture to witness caresses that his own
                  heart had longed for, and he groaned aloud.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" asked Cora, bending over him.</p>
               <p>"Nothing. Send the doctor to me, and leave us alone, awhile, please."</p>
               <p>"I will trouble you but this once, doctor. I want a despatch sent to my cousin,
                  Estella Brainard, of New York city, fell her I was hurt in the accident—that Grant
                  and Cora are with me and happy, and that I did not mention her. Tell her not to
                  come to me, for it will be too late. Now, doctor, my mission on earth is
                  ended."</p>
               <p>"If you are friends of this young man," said the doctor, after a time, coming to
                  the door, "you had better come in, for the end is very near."</p>
               <p>They went in. Cora knelt at his side, as before. Grant and the doctor stood at the
                  foot of the bed. He lay apparently lifeless. The doctor bent forward, laid his
                  finger upon his pulse, and whispered that it was growing fainter.</p>
               <p>Cora gazed sorrowfully down into his face, for deeply as he had injured her, it
                  filled her heart with grief to know that he "was swiftly passing away.</p>
               <p>Eugene opened his eyes and saw the look of compassion on her face. "Pray for me,"
                  said he, almost in-audibly.</p>
               <p>She sank down by his bed and prayed, oh, so earnestly, that God would pardon him
                  and take him to Himself. Then he closed his eyes again and lay like one
                  asleep.</p>
               <p>That evening, when the doctor sent the telegram that Eugene had dictated, Grant
                  sent another which read, <q>
                     <p>"EUGENE is dead; we leave here at one o'clock."</p>

               <p>Estella was in the library, writing, when the despatches were handed to hen She
                  glanced at them, and then<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6609-00000090"/> exclaimed
                  like one in despair, "Lost to me forever!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Estella, what are you doing?" asked Mrs. Brainard, coming into the room.</p>
               <p>Estella handed her the despatch from Grant.</p>
               <p>"Eugene dead! there must be some mistake. What is Grant Wardleigh doing
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"I have another despatch," said Estella, tearing it into pieces as she spoke, "It
                  was from Eugene. He was coming home; there was a collision, and he was hurt. He
                  said he could not live, and for us not to come to him, that it would only be too
                  late. I suppose he telegraphed for Grant as soon as he was hurt. My despatch must
                  have been delayed, for they both came at the same time."</p>
               <p>"That is what he has got for following a will-o'-the-wisp. He went to see Cora, I
                  know. Well, his fortune is ours," said she feigning no sorrow for his untimely
                  death.</p>
               <p>"The corpse will be here sometime in the morning. You must make all the
                  arrangements; I will see no one."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard glanced at Estella in surprise. Had she loved her cousin? But before
                  she could read her face, she was gone.</p>
               <p>"His grandmother must be sent for," said Mrs. Brainard, to herself, and writing a
                  message, caused, it to be sent.</p>

               <p>These lines came before Estella's mind, as she sat mute and motionless in her
                  room. "The past holds nothing; the present nothing; the future nothing; oh, my
                  God, and I so young!" and the pent up grief and remorse in her heart, broke forth
                  in great sobs. They were coming to-morrow; how could she meet them? How could she
                  look in Cora's innocent face, hear her kind words of sympathy, when she had been a
                  traitor? How could she look upon the cold face of the dead, for she felt that she
                  had been an instrument in bringing him to an untimely death. She had goaded him on
                  until, unprincipled though he was, his life had become a burden. She knew full
                  well but for her this sin would never have been committed, and now he had gone,
                  gone with his unrepented sins to meet his God.</p>
               <p>"Estella, show that you have some sense. Cora and Grant have been here for some
                  time. Why don't you come down? They think it strange that you have no looked at
                  your cousin," said her mother, as she stood at the door the next morning, which
                  Estella refused to open to any one.</p>
               <p>Estella did not reply, but after her mother had gone, she went quietly down the
                  stairs. Cora and Grant were standing by one of the windows as she entered the
                  room, and when Cora saw her, she greeted her cordially but sadly.</p>
               <p>She explained Eugene's confession, that he had been mutually forgiven by herself
                  and Grant, and ended by<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6609-00000091"/> saying, "We are
                  no longer estranged." Then she put her arms around Estella and kissed her.</p>
               <p>Estella tore herself almost rudely away. She could not be hypocrite enough to
                  receive the caresses of one whom in her heart she accused of robbing her of her
                  idol, for she believed he would yet have loved her. She walked into the room where
                  they had laid her cousin, and looked down on the face that had changed so terribly
                  since she last saw it. The closed eyes and mute lips sent a shaft of remorse to
                  her very soul, which seemed to say, "Wretch, look ye! it is your work!"</p>
               <p>Some one has said: "How hopeless the hour when we hear the dirge of bright
                  anticipations, the death-knell of life-long hopes, the funeral chant of love and
                  happiness: when an unseen mourner we stand by the grave of yearning desires and
                  joyous ambition, for which the light of no resurrection can ever break, over whose
                  green sod no sculptured monument can ever be erected, whose only epitaph, traced
                  in letters of fire upon our hearts, is the bitter, hopeless, "It might have
                  been!"</p>
               <p>Estella felt all this as she stood there and saw, through an opposite door, Grant
                  with Cora looking up fondly into his face. She clenched her hands, mad with
                  jealousy, and once more looking down upon the dead face, she exclaimed, bitterly,
                  "This one confession, did not secure for you pardon. Why could you not leave me
                  this one ray of happiness?" She looked up and saw her mother standing by her side,
                  silently regarding her.</p>
               <p>"Estella, are you crazy! What do your mean by such wild words?"</p>
               <p>Estella gave her a smile that she could not analyze, and said, Crazy? No; but I
                  feel as though I could go crazy."</p>
               <p>"I did not know you loved your cousin so well," said her mother.</p>
               <p>She gave a low, mocking laugh. "Love him! Yes—as well as I did a serpent!" and
                  passed from the room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brainard was perplexed. She did not know what to make of Estella; it was so
                  unusual for her to betray any emotion.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Brainard, his grandmother has come," said Hannah, at the door.</p>
               <p>They tell me that Eugene is dead," said she, coming into the room. "Why did you
                  not send for me before he died?"</p>
               <p>"We knew nothing about it until after he was dead," said Mrs. Brainard. "A
                  terrible accident happened to the tram he was on, and they brought him home dead.
                  Oh, it is too dreadful to think about!" said she, raising, the handkerchief to her
                  eyes. "Come and see him."</p>
               <p>His grandmother was not prepared to find him so changed, and it quite unnerved
                  her. She bent over him and cried, "Oh, my poor Eugene, I did not think I should
                  ever look upon your dead face! did not think you would go before," and she passed
                  her hand caressingly over his hair, and kissed the cold face, tenderly."</p>
               <p>"Are you not wearied with your journey? Let me get you some refreshments," said
                  Mrs. Brainard.</p>
               <p>She stood still as if she had not even heard her, and murmured, "Mary's child; the

                  and with feeble steps she followed Mrs. Brainard out of the room.</p>

               <p>WHEN Estella returned from the funeral, she saw there was only one thing to do to
                  deceive Minnie in her belief that she loved Grant Wardleigh and had been
                  complicated in Eugene's guilt to effect the estrangement—for that this was
                  Minnie's belief she knew full well, from the sundry hints she had thrown out in
                  her presence—and that one thing was to marry Mr. Claymore almost immediately,
                  making Minnie think it had been an engagement of long standing. She would have
                  cared but little if Minnie alone suspected this, but she was afraid Gerald and
                  Grant did also, and she would make any sacrifice, rather than have Grant convinced
                  of the truth concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Estella, a week after, "if you will send for Mr. Claymore, I will
                  see-him."</p>
               <p>"And accept him?" she asked in surprise, wondering what had come over Estella.</p>
               <p>"And accept him," she replied coldly.</p>
               <p>In response to the note that ran, "Estella has changed her mind, and will see you
                  this evening," Mr. Claymore came.</p>
               <p>Estella received him with studied politeness, and when his formal proposal was
                  ended, she accepted him. No kiss or word of endearment sealed this betrothal, but
                  they were as cold and seemingly as uninterested as though the contract had just
                  been made for lands. Estella passed by her mother's room, for she knew she was
                  there waiting to know the result of his call, but she had no heart to speak of it,
                  and going on to her own room to retire, she took up a bottle labelled Laudanum,
                  poured a portion of it in a spoon, saying to herself as she did so, "This will
                  bring oblivion for a night." The next morning she comprehended what a life hers
                  would be, mated to a man totally unlike her in tastes and feelings, but she had no
                  disposition to recall her consent, if she could have done so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Claymore, fearful lest Estella would again change her mind, pleaded for an
                  early marriage. To this she readily complied, and in a few weeks the invitations
                  were out.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Minnie to Cora, when she received hers, "Estella will never marry
                  that old man for love."</p>
               <p>"She surely will not marry him for money, for since Eugene died, she has plenty of
                  her own."</p>
               <p>"No; but she loves Grant Wardleigh, and will marry Mr. Claymore to keep people
                  from knowing that she is disappointed."</p>
               <p>"What nonsense! Minnie," said Cora, yet she could not help thinking that Estella
                  had acted very strangely. And then what Eugene had said just before he died, came
                  into her mind—that her old notes had been placed in his hands to tempt him. Could
                  it have been Estella that had done it? and if so, what had been her motive? It was
                  an enigma that she could not solve.</p>
               <p>"I would really like to know, Cora, if you are sorry that Eugene is dead?" said
                  Minnie, presently.</p>
               <p>"He wronged me, Minnie, I know, but he also loved<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000093"/> me, which made him more easily led into
                  temptation.</p>
               <p>The grave has covered his faults, and I have forgiven him all. I am truly sorry
                  that one so young, so capable of making a good, noble man, has gone so soon."</p>
               <p>"Estella has been so cold and silent ever since.</p>
               <p>"We cannot wonder at it, knowing what a shock his death must have been to
                  her."</p>
               <p>"She never told you that she intended to marry Mr. Claymore?"</p>
               <p>"No, I have not been alone with her since Eugene died, and then Estella rarely
                  speaks of any thing concerning herself, but she and I are too old friends to stand
                  on etiquette, and I shall go to see her this evening."</p>
               <p>Cora found Estella seated in an easy chair, her head resting on her hand, and an
                  unhappy look on her face.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Estella?" asked Cora, sitting down by her side.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, only I feel tired. Mother and I have been out shopping to-day," she
                  replied, wearily.</p>
               <p>"And you have been engaged this long while, and never told your best friend," said
                  Cora, reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"My dear Cora, I told no one, not even my mother. You received my cards?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I shall be married at home, and then visit several points of interest in New
                  England. When are you and Minnie going to wed?"</p>
               <p>"The first of October."</p>
               <p>Cora did not stay long with Estella, for she seemed so constrained in her presence
                  that it was a relief to get away.</p>
               <p>It was a wedding like most other weddings. Lights flashed, and gay music resounded
                  through the lofty rooms. Estella standing there in the presence of all, promised
                  to love, honor and obey the man by her side. Oh, how her whole soul recoiled from
                  the falseness of her vows! Was it a wonder that she almost swallowed a curse as
                  she felt the chains of her bondage sink deeper and deeper into her soul, though
                  outwardly she gave no sign of her suffering? The bridegroom, with a triumphant
                  light in his gray eyes, received their congratulations with a radiant face, for
                  although he did not love her, nor had made any pretentious that he did, yet he was
                  very proud that he had such a beautiful wife. The bride was cold, almost haughty,
                  some thought, and received all with calm indifference.</p>
               <p>"Doesn't she act strangely, whispered Minnie to Gerald. She seems like a
                  spirit—and look at her dress, not a spray of flowers nor an ornament, only that
                  great diamond blazing on her hand."</p>
               <p>"What change has come over Estella?" asked Minnie, as she stood among a bevy of
                  girls that were putting on their wrappings in the cloak room.</p>
               <p>"I don't Know; she is strangely quiet. Perhaps she regrets the step she has
                  taken."</p>
               <p>"Well, I do say she is a goose for marrying such an old man, when she could have
                  married any gentleman in our set, said another."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe she could," said Minnie, drily.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I did not think of the Judge when I spoke," said the other, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Was she not engaged to her cousin, at one time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; her mother said so."</p>
               <p>"Poor, dear fellow! how handsome he was—and to<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6609-00000094"/> meet with such a shocking death! I don't think she
                  cared very much for him, to marry so soon.</p>
               <p>"Come Minnie," said Cora, who had been a silent listner, wrapping her white cloak
                  about her, "father is waiting for us."</p>
               <p>The guests had all departed. The flowers were drooping in their vases, the elegant
                  mansion closed, and the inmates sleeping as quietly as though no unusual event had
                  disturbed the routine of every day life. All were at rest save one. She who should
                  have been dizzy with bliss, was passing through a thousand tortures in the secret
                  depths of her aching heart.</p>

               <p>A WOMAN less firm, less determined, might have borne to see her hopes swept away
                  with less struggle than Estella. With ail her power she had striven to hide her
                  feelings, but now as she was married, the tension of her feelings gave way, and
                  she returned home, only to be stricken down by the brain fever. Mr. Claymore with
                  all his pompousness, felt his heart warm toward his beautiful wife, as she lay
                  there as helpless as a babe, her fair cheeks rouged with fever, and the great
                  hazel eyes, wandering about the room in a dreamy sort of way. He experienced
                  something akin to sorrow, when the physician drew him aside, and told him he was
                  afraid she could not recover.</p>
               <p>"Is'there really no hope?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"If she is not better by midnight, she cannot possibly live."</p>
               <p>He turned away and sat down by her bedside, keeping a silent watch until alter the
                  crisis had passed, and when the doctor said, "She will live," he bent over, and
                  pressed his first kiss on her brow.</p>
               <p>When Estella awoke to consciousness and saw her mother, her husband and the
                  physician standing around her bed, she comprehended all in a moment, and looking
                  up into the doctor's face, a mournful look in her eyes, she said in a voice that
                  evinced nothing but utter despair, "Oh, why did you not let me die?"</p>
               <p>The doctor looked at her in surprise. "Let you die, dear lady! That is a strange
                  question, truly. You ought to be thankful that your life is spared."</p>
               <p>"Thankful for what—that I am spared to lead a hopeless, aimless life?" she asked,
                  bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Yours cannot be a hopeless, aimless life, for you have friends and a husband that
                  love you, and you should be happy."</p>
               <p>"What a mockery!. I shall never be happy," said she drearily, thinking of the
                  past.</p>
               <p>The doctor could not comprehend her meaning, but her mother knew the cause of all
                  her suffering, for in Estella's incoherent ravings she had again and again called
                  aloud for Grant, and her mother both pitied and scored her for her weakness. Mr.
                  Claymore knew nothing this, and Mrs. Brainard wisely refrained from telling<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6609-00000095"/> him. Estella recovered slowly, for she
                  had none of the vigor that hope always brings. No one could have been more
                  considerate of her wants than her husband, and any one less cold than Estella
                  could not have "helped feeling kindly toward him, but she accepted all with calm
                  indifference. Cora was a constant visitor at the house during her illness, and
                  when she had fully recovered, she came bringing Grant with her. At the sight of
                  his face, the old love revived again as warmly as ever, and the knowledge that she
                  was married put no-restraint upon her feelings. She felt that to stay there and
                  see him marry Cora, would be enough to make her go mad. That night she said to her
                  husband, with something like tenderness in her voice, "Please take me away from
                  here; I am so tired of the city."</p>
               <p>"Where do you want to go?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Any place, so it is near the sea."</p>
               <p>"Shall we go to S——?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it will suit as well as any other."</p>
               <p>Once at S——, she threw herself into the very vortex of fashionable dissipation,
                  spending night after night in the ball room, until her cheeks began to pale again,
                  and her step to become slow Her husband remonstrated with her, but she answered
                  him back with scorn almost demoniacal She cared not for any one. She had only one
                  aim, and that was to bury her past. But do as she would, Eugene's face as it lay
                  in the coffin haunted her day and night, and her guilty conscience slept no more.
                  People who saw her, expressed but one opinion—that she was "chaste as an icicle,
                  and every whit as cold." She rarely smiled, and when she did it was but a mockery
                  a smile. Her husband at last seldom objected to anything she did, for he knew the
                  diamonds glittering on her breast were no colder nor dead than her heart.</p>
               <p>The beach was her favorite resort, for she felt there was something in the wild
                  waves and seething foam akin to her nature.</p>
               <p>"Here is a letter from your mother," aid her husband one evening, as he found her
                  sitting there in the shadow of the rocks.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said she, taking the letter from him, and tossing it over into the
                  sea, without breaking the seal.</p>
               <p>He looked at her in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to read anything from her pen," she said in answer to his look. She
                  knew full well the letter contained the particulars of Cora's marriage that would
                  take place in a few days, and she had no desire to hear it. While sitting there
                  with the sea at her feet, the letter called up these lines of Tennyson, and made
                  her feel their truth. <q>

               <p>Mendelssohn's wedding march rang out loud and clear, and in all the splendor of
                  white satin and orange blossoms, Grant and Cora, Minnie and Gerald, were married.
                  As well pleased as Mr. Benoir was with Cora's choice, it was with almost a
                  breaking heart that he gave her away, for she had grown inexpressibly dear to him,
                  during the years that he had been alone. They spent a few days at Grant's old
                  home, and Aunt Chloe went half wild with delight, for she said she knew Grant had
                  nearly grieved himself to death about Miss Cora. Then they crossed the ocean for a
                  European tour.</p>
               <p>As the steamer was sailing up the Mersy, Minnie who was standing by Cora's side,
                  looking away to the city of Liverpool, in view, said, "Is it not strange?"</p>
               <p>"What strange, Minnie?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that after all your sorrow and misunderstanding you have glided into a haven
                  at last."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but should we live for all eternity, we can never make up for what we have
                  lost."</p>
               <p>Grant pressed the hand that lay in his as he heard her words, but said nothing.
                  What his thoughts were, only those who have passed through the same experience can
                  tell.</p>
               <p>"Estella, is it not time we were leaving here?" said her husband, coming into the
                  room one day where he found her lying on a couch, the old hopeless look on her
                  face.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I am ready whenever you are."</p>
               <p>"She had prolonged her stay until this late so as to avoid being present at Cora's
                  marriage, but now that she and Grant had gone, she felt that New York would be no
                  more of a desert than S——, and she went back to do the honors of her stately
                  mansion. Oh, how she hated, loathed, every one and every thing about it. Life was
                  to her a burden. She felt too wretched to live; too wicked to die. Men praised her
                  rare beauty, and women were envious and sighed when they thought of the grand
                  panoply of fashion and wealth which surrounded her, but ah, if they had looked
                  into her heart, they would have found it empty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Claymore knew that in marrying Estella, he had committed the greatest mistake
                  of his life, for her will could not be crossed in anything. Matrimonial bliss had
                  proved to be but a tread-mill to him.</p>
               <p>Six months passed by, and then the bridal party returned to New York. Mr. Benoir
                  said he was not willing to part with any one of them, but Minnie declared she was
                  aching to keep house, so the residence opposite was bought and furnished; then
                  they settled down in perfect harmony and contentment.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Estella's conscience, which had awakened, slept no more, and as the days passed
                  on, bringing with them their painful memories, she grew constantly more and more
                  uneasy, and when the spring came, she too left the New World for the Old, hoping
                  to forget all amid new scenes and associations. But go where she would, whether
                  wending her way along the banks of the beautiful Rhine, or threading the mountain
                  passes, or wandering among the wild glens and valleys of Switzerland, the old,
                  restless longing was never quenched. She had sought peace, but there was no peace.
                  She wondered as<pb n="192-193 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6609-00000097"/> she
                  stood on a balcony in Florence, looking out on the soft dreamy landscape, bathed
                  in the golden rays of the sunlight, if this was the country she had longed to see
                  in her girlhood. She remembered the time when this very, scene would have made her
                  grow dizzy with delight, but now she experienced nothing but utter indifference.
                  Oh, how that first wrong step had changed her whole course! But for that, she
                  might have been leading an untroubled if not a happy life, and Eugene have become
                  a noble, useful man.</p>
               <p>It is to be hoped, that in her wanderings Estella may find the only antidote to
                  the poison that is eating out her very heart, and that is, faith and trust in the
                  God she has neglected all these long, long years.</p>

                  <head>Trial of Rev. Wm. I. Gill, before the Newark Methodist Conference, for
                     Writing "Evolution and Progress."</head>
                  <head type="sub">[From the N. Y. Herald, April 7, 1875.]</head>
                  <p>The session of the Newark Methodist Conference, at Jersey City yesterday, was
                     the most lively since the commencement of the proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The Gill heresy case was taken up, and a lively debate took place for and
                     against the report of the investigating committee. During the debate, a decided
                     feeling was manifested among the audience, and the Rev. Dr. Porter hoped that
                     no such manifestations would be repeated. Bishop Bowman said that such
                     exhibitions could not be permitted, at which a pious brother remarked that he
                     couldn't help saying "amen" once in a while.</p>
                  <p>Rev. Mr. Gill then arose and opened his defence. The propositions he put to the
                     brethren was a very plain one. If they did not like the book they could reject
                     it. He held that there was nothing in it, in his beller, not in accordance with
                     the tenets of the Methodist Church, and he claimed the right to understand his
                     own book. He proposed, however, to search after truth wherever it may be found,
                     whether the Conference believed it was truth or not. He did not believe it was
                     the business of the Conference to pass judgment as to what were the truths of
                     science. His book was written according to new ideas which have been evolved,
                     and he said that to-day the evolutionists have the advantage philosophically
                     over the Church. He thought old ideas ought to be laid aside when God furnishes
                     new ones. Mr. Gill then spoke of the pain he felt because he was misunderstood.
                     He said, however, that although he is misunderstood, he still deemed that he
                     was right. He thanked God that he was a Methodist and hoped that the eyes of
                     the brethren would be opened to more advanced ideas, and that they will receive
                     more confidence. As to the report of the committee, if it was adopted he did
                     not know whether he would be able to give entire satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Rev. Dr. Crane paid a glowing tribute to the religious character of the Rev.
                     Mr. Gill, but thought that the bane and antidote in the book were too far
                     apart. Rev. Mr. Atkinson argued against the adoption of the report. He thought
                     it would be very inconsistent for the Conference to send forth a minister to
                     preach a gospel which his book utterly destroys.</p>
                  <p>After remarks by other speakers the question was put on the adoption of the
                     report, and it was carried and the character of the Rev. Mr. Gill was
                     passed.</p>
