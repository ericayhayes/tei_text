8      THE BLEMMERTONS; OR'&#xD;
&#xD;
Nay, not the least ! I thank the printer for printing,&#xD;
and you for reading. Only let this be premised. You&#xD;
must perminit me to have my own way. You must not&#xD;
attempt to cross nor to bias the bent of my mind ; but&#xD;
you must let me go on just as I please ; enjoy my own&#xD;
humor,-for, for many years, I have been my own&#xD;
master,-indeed, I do not know that I was not self-willed&#xD;
from the cradle.&#xD;
You must permit me to be cheerful, or melancholy,&#xD;
or witty, or religious, or philosophical, just as the vein&#xD;
runs. I will not, cannot, be forever cramped up in the&#xD;
small measure of dull sobriety ; I must away, at times,&#xD;
like the playful zephyr, over hills and dales, scenting&#xD;
the wild-flower, or listening to the singing-bird, nnn-&#xD;
gling in the glee and poetry of life. And sometimes I&#xD;
must be sentimental, perhaps never profound ; for I&#xD;
write of various things, and various characters, from&#xD;
man down to the animalcule,-and from the tiny plant,&#xD;
up to the glorious sun, which gives it life, and paints its&#xD;
flower with the blush and bloom  of beauty ! And&#xD;
should you smile or grow sad, and wipe the tear-drop&#xD;
from your eye, then it is not I that do it, but only my&#xD;
simple story from the Book of Life.&#xD;
" I assent to all this," you say,-" it is but reasona'-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
Then listen to the&#xD;
STORY OF THE BLEMMERTONS.&#xD;
It was in the autumn of 18-, that I was introduced&#xD;
to the Blemmertons. At that time they resided in the&#xD;
city of      ,to which place a business engagement&#xD;
led me. My business relations soon brought me in&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THlE WAYSIDE.              9&#xD;
contact with what, in common parlance, is termed&#xD;
"fashionable life." It was the season of gayety and&#xD;
hilarity, and, as is customary at that season, balls, par-&#xD;
ties, operas, lectures, concerts, etc., were at their flood.&#xD;
I am older now, by some years; and yet I well remem-&#xD;
ber the delight with which my breast thrilled, when I&#xD;
received my first invitation to a fashionable entertain-&#xD;
ment. I felt that my debut must be made with all the&#xD;
characteristic embarrassment and awkwardness of a&#xD;
young man, unacquainted with city ways, and who, for&#xD;
the first time, was to make his appearance amidst the&#xD;
fashion, luxury, brilliancy, and accomplishments of a&#xD;
great city. And yet the prospect was a pleasant one.&#xD;
It was quite an epoch in my history and experience. I&#xD;
was to date from that event. Hereafter I was to be&#xD;
something ;-hitherto all was a blank,-a long line of&#xD;
nothingness.&#xD;
Though not unused, in my native place, to the ways&#xD;
and customs of the "best society," as it is technically&#xD;
termed, I did not hide from myself the fact, that my&#xD;
old-fashioned, obsolete,homely manners, would contrast&#xD;
strangely, if not ludicrously, with the elegance and re-&#xD;
finement to which I was about to be introduced. I was&#xD;
not yet old enough to know, that life was made up of&#xD;
contrasts, strange, wonderful, and, at times, quite over-&#xD;
powering. The whole machinery of society, of life as&#xD;
it is, is made up, held together, and worked, by nothing,&#xD;
more nor less, than a grand set of contrasts,--one thing&#xD;
laid, as it were, against another, giving it shade and&#xD;
color, and, in turn, borrowing shade and color from it, and&#xD;
then held out, the two combined, in bold relief, to give&#xD;
the finishing touch to something else. And so contrast&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; 01,&#xD;
&#xD;
is seen by contact, as when the parting rays of the set-&#xD;
ting sun linger behind, to play with the cloud which&#xD;
hangs above the horizon, you behold, in the one picture,&#xD;
the glories of light and the glories of darkness ! If&#xD;
the figure appear involved and enigmatical, I have only&#xD;
to say, I intended it to be so. But it has a meaning,&#xD;
which, with your permission, will in due time come out.&#xD;
I pause not for explanations. I write from shadows and&#xD;
images in the heart, and the heart will understand them!&#xD;
I felt, I say, as though my old-fashioned, homely&#xD;
ways, would contrast strangely, if not ludicrously, with&#xD;
the elegance and refinement to which I was about to&#xD;
be introduced. It is ever so with those, at least, who&#xD;
do not fancy that they are wiser than all the world be-&#xD;
sides ; and who shrink from the fearful responsibility&#xD;
of setting themselves up as paragons of perfection, or&#xD;
as patterns for the imitation of their fellow-men. I had&#xD;
a strange, horrid presentiment of failure, of mortifica-&#xD;
tion, that oppressed my spirits, as a deadly incubus.&#xD;
Four days did I labor to cast off this oppressive feeling,&#xD;
but without success ; it was present to my thoughts,&#xD;
waking and sleeping.&#xD;
How could I meet the "lions," the beau-ideals of&#xD;
fashion and elegant accomplishments, unmoved ? In&#xD;
my silliness, I forgot that the heart, the mind, the intel-&#xD;
lect, make the man ! What had I to do with such&#xD;
meaningless things, as the mann-r of a bow, or of the&#xD;
entrance into a room, or the conventional formalities of&#xD;
an introduction ! Fie upon me, for such a folly ! I had&#xD;
a big heart in my body, full of the kind and genial&#xD;
warmth of life, and ready to run out to-heart wherever&#xD;
met. What needed I more? I had a head, which, though&#xD;
&#xD;
b&#xD;
&#xD;
3'&#xD;
&#xD;
young, was stored with gleanings from the Book of Life,&#xD;
and from many written pages of the good and wise, that&#xD;
had cost them years of intellectual labor. And I had a&#xD;
tongue, that never stammered nor faltered, when it was&#xD;
called into service. And yet I was frightened by a&#xD;
folly!&#xD;
I was younger then than I am now, and, consequent-&#xD;
ly, did not possess so much of the "philosophy of life"&#xD;
as I now do. This wretched feeling grew upon me. I&#xD;
could not master it. As the time approached, my&#xD;
timidity and apprehensions of rendering myself ridicu-&#xD;
lous, increased with fourfold keenness. A fashionable&#xD;
tailor was sought, and a rich suit, in the most approved&#xD;
style, was ordered; next, the boot-maker was brought&#xD;
into requisition, and a pair of "high-heels," of the best&#xD;
"calf;" was ordered to my room; then came the pure&#xD;
white French kids, the very ton of style,-and the ruf-&#xD;
fled bosom, (for ruffles were fashionable at that day ;)-&#xD;
and last, though not least, I paid the barber a visit, and&#xD;
was nicked and trimmed in the most approved style,&#xD;
(the moustache was not then the rage, as it is now,-had&#xD;
it been, I should, undoubtedly, have been under the&#xD;
painful necessity of borrowing or buying.) And yet it&#xD;
would not all answer ! -The mirror told the story ! In&#xD;
spite of every effort, I bore the marks of a gawky, coun-&#xD;
try lout. I should be the butt of the house. A-lack-a-&#xD;
day ! what snivelling, shrinking apes, pride makes&#xD;
of us !&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
MUSINGS BY THE WAY,--AN INCJDENT,-REMINISCENCES.&#xD;
I EVER was of a contemplative turn of mind. Even&#xD;
though mingling in scenes of festivity, running the&#xD;
rounds of gayety and pleasure, I yet had periods, many&#xD;
periods, of sober thoughtfulness: when the gay world&#xD;
was shut out from my heart, and it mused on the mys-&#xD;
teries of nature, or the depths of Divine wisdom and&#xD;
goodness; or contemplated the striking contrasts be-&#xD;
tween the conditions of men, the oppressions and hard-&#xD;
ships of poverty, the heart-withering, blighting influ-&#xD;
ences of wealth, with its accompaniments of voluptu-&#xD;
ousness, prodigality, and misapplication of time and&#xD;
means, given by a benevolent Father, for higher and&#xD;
holier purposes.&#xD;
It was the day before my anticipated introduction to&#xD;
fashionable life, that, in one of my half-sad, half melan-&#xD;
choly, contemplative moods, towards the setting in of&#xD;
twilight, I emerged from my hotel, and leisurely saun-&#xD;
tered down a crowded thoroughfare, scarcely knowing&#xD;
or caring whither I went, or on what intent. In every&#xD;
man's life there are strange turns, or turns that appear&#xD;
to be strange, as he looks back upon them, which,&#xD;
somehow or another, lead to events that leave their im-&#xD;
press forever. And without the reasonable, comforta-&#xD;
ble, Christian doctrine of an'overruling Providence,&#xD;
causing all things, even the strange, unaccountable things&#xD;
&#xD;
of life, to work together for good to them that seek&#xD;
good, we should often be baffled by our life experience.&#xD;
But, with this heavenly doctrine before him, the Chris-&#xD;
tian has a key, which unlocks many events that would&#xD;
otherwise appear mysterious.&#xD;
I mean not to assert, that this clears, or solves the&#xD;
mystery. Nay, not exactly that ; but it often enables us&#xD;
to see the hand that rules and guides in the mystery;&#xD;
and faith rests satisfied with this, aind dwells with rap-&#xD;
ture on the thought that the Almighty governs,-not&#xD;
only in "the whirlwind and the storm,"-but in many,&#xD;
ah, how many ! of even of the apparently trifling inci-&#xD;
dents of life, bringing to Himself honor and glory,&#xD;
teaching us deep and abiding lessons in love, and train-&#xD;
ing our hearts, or developing our character, for a wide&#xD;
sphere of benevolence. And why should it be thought&#xD;
a thing incredible, that the All-wise Father of Mercies&#xD;
should, by some secret or hidden influence, direct our&#xD;
steps unto chance opportunities, as they may be termed,&#xD;
of doing good,-opportunities, that is, which we do not&#xD;
'seek, but with which we, nevertheless, meet, as it were,&#xD;
casually or accidentally ? I verily believe it, and cherish&#xD;
the belief, as among the sweetest treasures of that faith,&#xD;
which teaches me to go out of myself,-to fall down&#xD;
before, and do lowly reverence to, Him who hath num-&#xD;
bered the very hairs of my head !&#xD;
Now, I had not pursued my walk far, before I found,&#xD;
that I had threaded my path out of the crowd, into a&#xD;
less-frequented, and more secluded street. Along this&#xD;
I slowly wended my way, wrapped in my own medita-&#xD;
tions, unobserved and unobserving. I rejoiced to be&#xD;
free, at that calm, holy hour, from the noise, bustle, and&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
clamor, of a great city. For the first time since I I £1&#xD;
entered it, I found myself alone. It was really a e-&#xD;
freshment to my spirits. My heart ran out in gei jal&#xD;
musings; my consciousness, my personal identity, ret: rn-&#xD;
ed to me. Hitherto I had been in a whirl of con no-&#xD;
tion and excitement, carried hither and thither by the&#xD;
fluctuating tides of a new life ;-I was myself agai i. I&#xD;
could think of home, and the dear ones whom Ii had&#xD;
left behind. The everlasting whirl of that great city&#xD;
went on as usual ; but, to me all was silent, silent as the&#xD;
profound stillness of death ! I was alone with myself,&#xD;
and with IIhm to whom my heart did homage&#xD;
And yet I was not alone. There was one being be-&#xD;
sides myself, who, unobserved by all save him who&#xD;
counteth the pulsations of the heart, pursued her lonely&#xD;
way along that deserted street. A lamp, which gave a&#xD;
flickering light, enabled me, as I met her, (for we were&#xD;
going in opposite directions,) to mark the traces of sor-&#xD;
row in the awful gloom and melancholy, which, as a&#xD;
dark cloud, rested on her countenance. 1 had met one&#xD;
of the sorrowing of earth I It was enough. A chord&#xD;
was touched that woke in my soul the music of heaven-&#xD;
born charity and pity! I was just in that mbod to&#xD;
which a tale of sorrow would bring a real balm. I was&#xD;
in love with all mankind. My heart was sad, and full&#xD;
of kindly sympathies, and gushed out towards that&#xD;
lonely stranger.&#xD;
There are moments of our existence, when our sym-&#xD;
pathies are fuller of life than at others. There are few,&#xD;
who are striving to strew flowers along life's pathway,&#xD;
or to chase away the shadows of darkness from sorrow-&#xD;
ing hearts, who will not avouch for this truth. There&#xD;

are times, when we really love to come in contact with&#xD;
sorrow,-not for the sufferer's sake,-nay, but for our&#xD;
own. Since sorrow is the portion of man's cup, and all&#xD;
must drink more or less deeply of it, as the dispensa-&#xD;
tion of a wise and holy Father, we would not be alto-&#xD;
gether segregated from it; we would come in contact&#xD;
with it; we would strive to soothe it, to pour oil&#xD;
upon it. It is not that we take pleasure in the wail of&#xD;
human anguish. Nay, you will not understand me&#xD;
thus. This would not be a Christian sentiment, but one&#xD;
indicative of a heart-sickness, near akin to misanthropy.&#xD;
I profess to be but. little versed in anthroposophy&#xD;
and yet, methinks,. the full throbbing heart of hum ani-&#xD;
ty, going out towards and throbbing for humanity, when&#xD;
guided by that "still small voice" whose infant whis-&#xD;
perings were heard first in the manger, will bear wit-&#xD;
ness to the sentiment, that there are times peculiar, and&#xD;
above all others, when we love to come in contact with&#xD;
sorrow. We feel, that it is good for us. It draws us&#xD;
nearer to heaven. It is a genuine cordial to the heart;&#xD;
and we feel as though we could bless the Providence&#xD;
that directed us to it! At least, such were my feelings.&#xD;
As we passed each other beneath that flickering light,&#xD;
a pensive, melancholy glance of sorrow pierced my heart.&#xD;
No word was spoken ; no appeal to my charities or com-&#xD;
miseration was made. She passed on. But, oh ! that&#xD;
look of deep dejection, the silent language of a deeply-&#xD;
wounded, if not broken heart, told its story,-a story,&#xD;
that I could not, would not resist.&#xD;
Now, with all my other failings, I am very impulsive.&#xD;
Following the current of my feelings, I seldom pause&#xD;
for reflection:; seldom pause f'or what philosophers term&#xD;

" forethought,"-I mean of course in the common-place&#xD;
charities of life,-but go at once out of myself, forget-&#xD;
ting self and selfish things, right in pursuit of whatever&#xD;
is in keeping with the dictates of my sympathetic f eel-&#xD;
ings and impressions. And now I must know that tale&#xD;
of sorrow. It was an impulse in the right direction. It&#xD;
was a voice from God, speaking to my inner being.&#xD;
Perhaps, had I thought of the proprieties of life, I&#xD;
should not have accosted a lone young female, at such&#xD;
a time and place. I should have passed on, heedless of&#xD;
any other consideration than that of propriety ; so that&#xD;
heaven-born charity would have been locked out of my&#xD;
heart, (or rather in it,) and I should have passed on heed-&#xD;
less of the sufferings of one too sensitive to appeal to&#xD;
me, and yet too worthy to be left to unappeased sorrow.&#xD;
And more: I should have gone down to the tomb,&#xD;
without the blessed memory of a good deed which has&#xD;
ever been to me as light in darkness, and which, doubt-&#xD;
less, I shall carry with me into the eternal world,-a&#xD;
source of joy throughout the ages of eternity !&#xD;
Kind reader, did you ever perform a good act, a deed&#xD;
of mercy, that for many days, many years, made your&#xD;
heart laugh for joy; that stirred up its deep fountains,&#xD;
ever and anon, as your memory recurred to that deed?&#xD;
Then you can sympathize with me, in my fond feelings&#xD;
of the past, as the memory of one glorious act coines up&#xD;
before me, and I contemplate the many, many bless-&#xD;
ings that have been invoked upon my head, through&#xD;
the long intervening years. Aye, and may it not be,&#xD;
that that good deed shall rise up and call me blessed, in&#xD;
my Father's home, when the thread of life is snapped,&#xD;
and I stand among the hosts who have passed the flood&#xD;
&#xD;
of death? I say it not as boasting,-nay, nay, God&#xD;
forbid. I speak it as a hope, as a faint foretaste of the&#xD;
glorious revelations of memory in the world to come.&#xD;
I speak it not as of merit,-nay, nay,-of merit there&#xD;
is none, but in ONE. He merits all ;-He bestows all,&#xD;
of free, unmerited grace. And yet, if that good deed&#xD;
so blesses me while tabernacling in the flesh,-if it so&#xD;
thrills my heart while seeing " through a glass darkly,"&#xD;
and reading myself so imperfectly, I know, when the&#xD;
shadows shall flee away, and I shall " know as also I am&#xD;
known," that that good deed will wake my heart with&#xD;
everlasting songs of joy, and fill my soul with gladness&#xD;
throughout eternity.&#xD;
Such is the necessary result of good actions. They&#xD;
leave behind them happy, pleasant memories. Good&#xD;
deeds carry with them their own reward ; and yet I&#xD;
would not say that the reward is not of grace. It is of&#xD;
grace, and yet it is a reward, if I may so speak,~spring-&#xD;
ing out of the action itself. It is so, because it cannot&#xD;
be otherwise. God hath so ordained,-it springs of&#xD;
Him; it is a great law of His kingdom,-a great law of&#xD;
a probationary state; and so it is of grace. Man, hav-&#xD;
ing cut himself off from God, having lost his purity, no-&#xD;
thing but grace could search him out and reinstate him&#xD;
in God's favor; so that all is resolved into the overflow-&#xD;
ings of the divine mercy in the Cross of Christ.&#xD;
Man viewed as a probationer, as a rational being, is&#xD;
obliged by a law d priori, antecedent to all other laws,&#xD;
to do good, to obey God; and, therefore, there can, be&#xD;
no merit in the sight of a Holy Being, who must meas-&#xD;
ure all actions by the inflexible standard of justice. As&#xD;
a general thing, men dwell not enough on such thoughts.&#xD;

They are too prone to consider the Almighty as an ar-&#xD;
bitrary dispenser of rewards and punishments ; forget-&#xD;
ting, that He is a law unto Himself, and unto all things&#xD;
emanating from  Him,* and that He governs and dis-&#xD;
penses, by afixed law. Nothing can be more deroga-&#xD;
tory to the divine goodness, than losing sight of this&#xD;
fact. Goodness is so intrinsically good, that it is its own&#xD;
reward: wickedness is so intrinsically evil, that it is its&#xD;
own punishment. " Verily I say unto you, they have&#xD;
their reward."&#xD;
Whatsoever a man seeks, in that shall he find his&#xD;
reward. If lie seek holiness, goodness, religion, alle-&#xD;
giance with his Creator and Redeemer, he shall cer-&#xD;
tainly find them and their reward, if lie seek aright and&#xD;
with all his heart. If he seek vice, irreligion, unbelief,&#xD;
he shall find them and be rewarded in them. In the&#xD;
one case, the reward found will be eternal happiness;&#xD;
in the other, eternal misery. lie cannot be rewarded&#xD;
in that which he does not seek. As I have before&#xD;
stated, man is a probationer, a rational being, and&#xD;
therefore lie chooses freely; and, freely choosing evil,&#xD;
he must meet the reward of evil. It springs naturally&#xD;
out of itself, and yet it is none the less the reward of&#xD;
the Divine justice, because, as in the other case,&#xD;
it is a great law of His kingdom, and cannot be oth-&#xD;
erwise.&#xD;
Grace, through the incarnation and atonement of the&#xD;
Son of God, intervenes, to give man reconciliation with&#xD;
God; to pardon the demerit of even his best works; for&#xD;
sin mingles with all man's doings, even the best of&#xD;
* Archbishop Leighton-&#xD;

them. Were it not so, that is, were it not for the GRACE&#xD;
of the ATONEMENT, no man could be reinstated in God's&#xD;
favor, or receive the rewards of free grace. Then it&#xD;
necessarily follows, that if man will not have, or accept&#xD;
of grace, (Faith is the hand which he must hold out to&#xD;
receive,) to blot out his sins, to hide his imperfections,&#xD;
the imperfections even of his best performances ; he&#xD;
must be left to reap the fruits of his own way,-" For&#xD;
whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."&#xD;
hence, then, for the man who would be happy in&#xD;
the world to come, it is an abiding law, that he must&#xD;
seek that happiness in this life, or he cannot have it&#xD;
hereafter. For how could the impure, the unjust, the&#xD;
unsanctified in heart, and life, and temper, be happy in&#xD;
heaven? Its holy associations, the blaze of its eternal&#xD;
day and glory, would confound them. Not a chord in&#xD;
their hearts would beat in unison with the gladsome&#xD;
symphonies of that Temple not made with hands. They&#xD;
would meet nothing there ,congenial to their tastes or&#xD;
inclinations; not one sentiment with which they could&#xD;
sympathize ; and it is the law of rational intelligence,&#xD;
fixed, universal, incontrovertible, that it can be happy&#xD;
only in kindred association.&#xD;
Take a man of really depraved and wicked disposi-&#xD;
tions and habits, (I mean not some one of the weak ves-&#xD;
sels of earth, who, though ever and anon turning aside,&#xD;
here and there, from the right way, are yet struggling&#xD;
at the foot of the cross, striving manfully to overcome&#xD;
every weakness and every sin, and washing them out&#xD;
through the atoning blood of Christ, in the tears of&#xD;
penitence,)-but, one devoid of all holy aspirations, who&#xD;

fear of a judgment to come, and every emotion of love&#xD;
and gratitude to his heavenly Father. Take such a&#xD;
one, I say, from the scenes, employment, and associa-&#xD;
tions in which he has sought his happiness, and place&#xD;
him in the company of the sanctified, where every word&#xD;
that he hears will utter to him an awful reproach. Let&#xD;
him hear but the language of saintliness, the music of&#xD;
the heavenly harpings, and I ask, can he be happy?&#xD;
Will not every word, every note that falls upon his ear,&#xD;
be as a scorpion lash,-every sound, hateful to his heart&#xD;
and ears,-and will he not cry out, in his misery, for&#xD;
some strong arm to snatch him from his own condem-&#xD;
nations; or some dark cloud, if possible, to hide him&#xD;
from himself?&#xD;
But I intend not to run into the depths of theology.&#xD;
I have said so much, to clear up a former remark ; and&#xD;
to show my feelings and impressions, as I dwell on the&#xD;
recollection of a good deed. I lay no claim to merit,-&#xD;
nay, perish the thought !-and yet that deed has ever&#xD;
blessed me, ever been as a very pleasant line in the&#xD;
checkered history of my life, as year by year has writ-&#xD;
ten that history up; and if it is so gracious a cordial&#xD;
to my heart now,-so pleasant and thrilling a remiis-&#xD;
cence,-much more will it be so in the world to come,&#xD;
when all shall be light, and no shadow shall intervene&#xD;
between me and the past !&#xD;
That silent appeal of sorrow! That lone girl, the&#xD;
picture of unutterable grief! Was she not one of the&#xD;
"wounded and bruised" by the wayside, left "half&#xD;
dead," whose tale of anguish appealed to the passer-by,&#xD;
for the kindly offices of the good Samaritan? iow&#xD;

many, perchance, like the Priest or the Levite, had&#xD;

upon the scene of wretchedness, yet hurried away with-&#xD;
out so much as a loving word ! Ah, I know not, and&#xD;
yet, alas ! it is a common case. In a crowded city,&#xD;
poverty, suffering, misery, leave their deep, abiding&#xD;
traces in many hearts which are revealed in the hag-&#xD;
gard, care-worn countenance, in the stinted garments,&#xD;
tottering steps, shrivelled, feeble, and skeleton.like bod-&#xD;
ies. And men grow accustomed to such sights; their&#xD;
hearts grow callous by familiarity. Ah, it is a sad,&#xD;
dreary picture; but true, alas! too true. We appeal to&#xD;
the great experience of life. Go back, reader, to the&#xD;
days of your youth, and tell me what were your im-&#xD;
pressions, when first you read in the sacred page the&#xD;
story of the sufferings and magnanimity of a Joseph.&#xD;
Did not your heart recoil from the wicked deed of his&#xD;
brethren, when they thrust him into the pit, or sold him&#xD;
to the stranger, to be taken far away from his loved and&#xD;
loving home? And did it not bleed with that aged&#xD;
Patriarch, when the iron went into his soul, and he&#xD;
wrapped himself in gloom, the mourning of a crushed&#xD;
heart, to go down to the grave sorrowing unto his be-&#xD;
loved son?&#xD;
But pass on, pass on,--for the scene changes. Did&#xD;
not your heart swell and throb, when you beheld those&#xD;
cruel brethren, years after, compelled by hard neces-&#xD;
sity to stand in the presence of that injured brother,&#xD;
strangers in a strange land,-and lo, when the curtain&#xD;

And go yet further ; take up some line from your&#xD;
own youthful observation. In younger days, ere the&#xD;
heart was hardened, or rendered callous, ere theomarks&#xD;
of many sorrows, many disappointments, or many&#xD;
rebellions against its pleadings, had scarred it over, dd&#xD;
you ever witness pain or anguish, without experiencing&#xD;
the up-risings of sympathy and commiseration ? Nay,&#xD;
never, never! For hours, you have followed the men-&#xD;
dicant on his lowly pilgrimage, from door to door, ask-&#xD;
ing alms, to satisfy the cravings of his nature. For&#xD;
hours, you would stand and gaze upon the blind beggar,&#xD;
as he sat by the wayside, and stretched out his gaunt&#xD;
fingers for the mite of charity. And how has your&#xD;
heart bled, when one by one the throng passed on,&#xD;
heedless of that outstretched arm, and the appeal from&#xD;
those sightless eyes ! And at last, when some good&#xD;
Samaritan passed that way, and that arm was heeded,&#xD;
and the deed of love wasdone, as the tears of joy and&#xD;
gratitude streamed from those sightless eyes, you could&#xD;
bear no more, but mingled your tears with his, and&#xD;
went on your way with a lighter heart. And how you&#xD;
envied that good Samaritan his deed of love! Oh that&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
SOME OF LIFEI sInEART-ACHES,-MR. ARDENT-MAKING A&#xD;
ThSTA1E. .&#xD;
KIND reader, did you ever enter the abode of wretch-&#xD;
edness, of heart-rending poverty, with its attendant suf-&#xD;
ferinogs and afflictions ? If not, you have yet much to&#xD;
learn; your heart is not yet schooled for a world-wide&#xD;
sphere of charity. Perhaps, such a scene would not be&#xD;
congenial to your taste ; and yet, I opine, it will be a&#xD;
blessing to you. Life is but half realized while we see&#xD;
only its bright side. The picture must be shaded&#xD;
properly, to give it due effect. Every well-trained&#xD;
artist is aware of this ; and in its due appreciation and&#xD;
management, he adds the finishing touch to his paint-&#xD;
inig, and acquires the title of mater. It is ever so&#xD;
with our life-experience. There must be the shading,&#xD;
to give us a, full impression. We need the dark side,&#xD;
to enable us to see the bright to advantage. And these&#xD;
are the contrasts, of which we spoke in a former chap-&#xD;
ter. We need to see, yea, and to feel, when our FATIIER&#xD;
sees it good for us, some of the blightings and sorrows&#xD;
of life, to enable us to appreciate its " pleasant lines,"&#xD;
and gain some glimpses of the debt which we owe our&#xD;
Father for Iris mercies.I&#xD;
Go with me, then. That little girl whom I met, and&#xD;
whom we saw by the lamp-light, shall conduct us. We&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.              25&#xD;
move on, street by street, up this lone, filthy alley, and&#xD;
down that, passing the dim-burning lamps, threading&#xD;
our way we know not whither. But we may follow&#xD;
our guide. Her weary feet have trudged over the&#xD;
same desolate way, carrying her aching heart and&#xD;
throbbing temples,-ah, how many times !-to the&#xD;
same home of wretchedness, with the sad reproach, on&#xD;
a heartless world, of the neglect of the claims of char-&#xD;
ity. . . . And at last we are at our destination.&#xD;
This is the house.&#xD;
We pause, and look upon it. "It is a wretched&#xD;
abode," you say. It is November; the night is chill;&#xD;
the hoar-frost is gathering thick on the remnant of&#xD;
living vegetation; the stream in the gutter is icing&#xD;
over ; the hoarse winds sigh through the broken panes.&#xD;
We ascend a rickety stairway, which runs up outside,&#xD;
at the gable; and we enter. There is no light, except&#xD;
from a few coals on the hearth. But we hear deep,&#xD;
heavy breathings,-the moanings of death! There,&#xD;
alone, on a miserable pallet of straw, scantily covered&#xD;
with a few tattered fragments of clothing, lies a wreck&#xD;
of disease and suffering, breathing out his life. Soon&#xD;
must the soul wing its way to its God! There is no&#xD;
loving life-partner, to bathe those aching temples, or&#xD;
wipe off the death-damps; for, disease, too, has now&#xD;
laid its hand on her who would gladly have performed&#xD;
the last sad offices of affection. Long and anxious&#xD;
watchings, and the deeper trials of extreme poverty,&#xD;
have done their work. But, the deep-drawn sigh which&#xD;
falls upon the ear from the adjoining room, tells, that&#xD;
there is more than disease crushing that heart, or prey-&#xD;
ing upon those -vitals ! There is a blight there, deeper&#xD;

far than that made by the icy hand of death; that sigh&#xD;
tells of the sorrows of a broken heart!&#xD;
These three,-husband, wife, and daughter,-were&#xD;
the sole tenants of that upper room. And their story&#xD;
is soon told,-alas ! it is but too common. Five years&#xD;
ago they were a contented, happy, and prosperous&#xD;
family. William Wallace (as I had the story from his&#xD;
dying lips) was a respectable mechanic in the employ-&#xD;
ment of Mr. Blemmerton, a wealthy manufacturer. On&#xD;
a cold night in December, five years before, a fire had&#xD;
broken out in Mr. Blemmerton's premises, and Wallace,&#xD;
hearing the alarm, at the dead hour of night, rushed&#xD;
to the scene of the conflagration, and exerted every&#xD;
nerve to save the property. Through fire and smoke&#xD;
he toiled, even rushing into the very flames, until the&#xD;
fire was subdued.&#xD;
But little comparative damage ensued ; the mass of&#xD;
the property was saved. But Wallace never recovered&#xD;
from his almost superhuman exertions. He became a&#xD;
prey to consumption; and for five years had his life&#xD;
dwindled away, until now his hour had come ! And&#xD;
oh ! what an hour, under the most favorable circumn-&#xD;
stances !-but how peculiarly awful to him, reduced as&#xD;
he was to extreme poverty, his heart twining about his&#xD;
widowed wife and his orphan daughter, in their pitia-&#xD;
ble condition ! Ah, could some of the more favored of&#xD;
earth have heard that history, gazed upon that picture,&#xD;
would they not have been moved to pity and relieve?&#xD;
It is a picture around them every day, in crowded&#xD;
cities, but, alas ! they will not see it ! It meets them&#xD;
at almost every step, but they shun it, pass by on the&#xD;
other side, or ifperchance they approach and look -upon&#xD;

poor, the afflicted, shall not always be forgotten.&#xD;
Want of proper food and nourishment had evidently&#xD;
shortened Wallace's days; and his wife, worn out with&#xD;
hunger and wretchedness, must soon follow him, unless&#xD;
timely relief be extended. "And this poor child,"&#xD;
said the dying father, "my beloved Agnes, my only&#xD;
child, she has been all my support; she has worked,&#xD;
toiled through the day, and begged a pittance, at night,&#xD;
from the shopkeepers, with whom we used to deal when&#xD;
our circumstances were better, and so has kept us alive.&#xD;
But ah me, they are growing weary of her applications&#xD;
for charity; and the poor child knows not how to beg&#xD;
of strangers. Ah, Sir, though in humble life, we&#xD;
guarded our darling child, as long as we could, from&#xD;
the rough contact of the world. She is a simple-minded,&#xD;
guileless thing, too sensitive to go out on a mission, that&#xD;
oftener meets the cold frown of the world, than the&#xD;
cheering smile of loving sympathy. And now, poor&#xD;
child, she is to be alone,-alone in the world. Ah me !&#xD;
ah me ! My heart,-my poor breaking heart! But&#xD;
she will be better off; she will have one less to care&#xD;
and provide for,-one less to watch, one less to beg for!&#xD;
"Come near me, my child, my only child ! 0 sweet&#xD;
title of the parental relationship !-come near me, my&#xD;
child. Your father is going, at last! Let me look&#xD;
upon you, once more. God Almighty bless you, my&#xD;
dear, dutiful daughter ! The God of the FATHERLESS&#xD;
raise you up friends, and protect you, in a cold and&#xD;
heartless world,! It is all your dying father can give&#xD;
you,-his blessing ! Even now, the scanty furniture,&#xD;

the remnant of what we once had, even the pallet on&#xD;
which my dying body lies, in four days will be taken&#xD;
from you, and sold to pay my debt! Ah! my heart,&#xD;
my heart! Lay your head upon my heart, my daugh-&#xD;
ter. There,-so !"--and he pressed her to his bosom.&#xD;
"1There, Sir," said he, "read that," holding out a&#xD;
paper,-4--a written notice to quit the premises by a cer-&#xD;
tain day. Hurriedly moving my eye over the lines,&#xD;
what was my consternation when I found that it bore&#xD;
the signature of John Blemmerton !-Blemmerton, in&#xD;
whose service that dying man had spent his best days !-&#xD;
Blemmerton, whose property had been saved, at the&#xD;
sacrifice of that dying man's life !-Blemmerton, whose&#xD;
halls the next evening were to ring with the merry&#xD;
laugh, while the widow and the fatherless, whom he&#xD;
should have succored and protected, should be crushed&#xD;
and blighted in the heart, by his cruel inhumanity and&#xD;
injustice!&#xD;
But even the worst is not yet told ; for, there was an&#xD;
execution, in the hands of an officer, on every article of&#xD;
furniture or property of any kind in that house, all of&#xD;
which was to be taken, and in four days sold for rent !&#xD;
The debt was about thirty dollars ; and this, all the&#xD;
worldly goods in the dying man's possession would not&#xD;
liquidate. This troubled him. He named not the injus-&#xD;
tice, the cruelty of his old employer and landlord,-I-&#xD;
know not that such a thought crossed his mind; but&#xD;
he was evidently pained, that he should not leave&#xD;
behind him enough even to pay that debt. He had,&#xD;
however, one consolation: "KMy sweet Agnes," said he,&#xD;
"has promised, if ever she is able, to pay the last penny."&#xD;
"God only is great." You rise up and exclaim,&#xD;
&#xD;
I1&#xD;
&#xD;
Peace, peace, troubled man; thy last moments shall be&#xD;
lighted up with joy. Pass on into the "valley of the&#xD;
shadow of death," leaning on the "staff," and protected&#xD;
by the "rod," of Immanuel. The widow    and thy&#xD;
fatherless shall be cared for. This hour dates a new era&#xD;
in their chequered life. God hath raised up the Good&#xD;
Samaritan. "The Lord defendeth the fatherless and&#xD;
widow: as for the way of the ungodly, He turneth it&#xD;
upside down."  Ps. 146 : 9. "Leave thy fatherless&#xD;
children, I will. preserve them alive ; and let thy&#xD;
widows trust in ME."  Jer. 49 : 11. "Man goeth to&#xD;
his long home, and the mourners go about the streets,"&#xD;
Ece. 12 : 5; but that trembling spirit departs in peace.&#xD;
Long has been the struggle, dark has been the way, but&#xD;
there is light at the last.&#xD;
" Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."&#xD;
Job 5 : 7. Without intending to write a line on the&#xD;
question of slavery, pro or con., we feel at liberty to&#xD;
say, that we have little faith in that noisy philanthropy,&#xD;
which is ever busy in making "red flannel shirts for&#xD;
the little negroes in Africa," while it gives the " cold&#xD;
shoulder," as they say in Yankeedom, to the cries of&#xD;
poverty and distress around it. Place a Southern colored&#xD;
man in one of your pent-up factories, or scorch him&#xD;
over your hot, smoking furnaces, in the dank, dark&#xD;
room, from seven in the morning to' six o'clock in the&#xD;
evening, and he would soon die, or sing, "Carry me&#xD;
back to old Virginny." Ah! talk as you please about&#xD;
these questions, from the fall of man you may trace&#xD;
onward the stream of time, and everywhere you will&#xD;
behold that sentence written, "Man is born unto trouble,&#xD;
as the sparks fly upward."&#xD;

We find no fault with those who are striving, in the&#xD;
spirit of the true self-denial of the Gospel, to ameliorate&#xD;
his condition, under whatever circumstances. Let self&#xD;
be cast into the shade, and to all efforts for man's good,&#xD;
in whatever condition, that will bear the tests of trute&#xD;
charity,-the tests of her true weights when placed in&#xD;
her scale,-(for, charity measures all questions, in all&#xD;
their bearings, proximate or remote, and is not content&#xD;
with less than a perfect eguilibrieun,) we are willing to&#xD;
give God speed.&#xD;
But, man is a one-sided creature the world over. lie&#xD;
has but one pair of spectacles ; and they rarely enable&#xD;
him to see in more directions than one. It would be a&#xD;
blessed thing, if some of the one-sighted philanthropists&#xD;
of this philanthropic age would have their spectacles&#xD;
fitted with glasses looking in different directions,-one&#xD;
glass to see that picture, the other to look upon this.&#xD;
We opine, that they would have a more extended&#xD;
vision, and would bless us for the suggestion. We have&#xD;
ourselves seen some sights, and taken some notes,&#xD;
through a pair of these double-glassed spectacles. For&#xD;
instance, we have seen white men, by scores and hun-&#xD;
dreds, when the thermometer, in the shade, stood at&#xD;
98° Fahrenheit, toiling before the melting furnace, the&#xD;
great sweat-drops rolling down their begrimed faces,-&#xD;
yea, by scores dropping dead at their posts, from the&#xD;
heat, and this from seven in the morning till six in the&#xD;
evening,-no pure air,-the hot breath of the molten&#xD;
iron,-the red glare of the furnace,-no intermission but&#xD;
for dinner, a brief honr,-smut and smoke, and toil and&#xD;
sweat,-no recreation from day to day,-no Saturday's&#xD;
holiday,-no one to provide a physician, or to care for&#xD;
&#xD;
the helpless family, when sickness comes,-no wages&#xD;
accruing while disease preys upon the vitals ; and if&#xD;
poverty or death ensue, no friendly hand to pro-&#xD;
vide for the widow and the fatherless. No work, no&#xD;
pay.&#xD;
Go out, ye helpless ones, to beg and be scoffed at, or&#xD;
go to the Alnshouse, to conceal your poverty from the&#xD;
public eye. It will not answerfor youto appear on the&#xD;
streets, among the living mass of useful men. There is&#xD;
no pity for you. The world is run mad with philan-&#xD;
thropy. Its words are large and swelling; but, alas !&#xD;
you will find, that it requires more than words to clothe&#xD;
the body and feed the stomach ! And those frail young&#xD;
girls in the factory, pent up amidst the everlasting ding-&#xD;
dong of the machinery ; no merry laugh or gleeful&#xD;
song, but work, work,-haste, haste,-shuttle, scuttle,&#xD;
helter, skelter, ding, dell, hurry, scurry, heat and dust,&#xD;
tainted air and tainted breath,-so they go from morn&#xD;
till night,-never stopping, always pressing,-limbs&#xD;
quivering, hearts bleeding: or others, in the garret,&#xD;
bending over the needle, before the dim-burning lamp,&#xD;
at the hour ' of midnight,-gaunt bodies,-slender&#xD;
fingers, aching temples,-poor pay,-scanty subsist-&#xD;
ence,-slender pittance,-work, work, work,-toil on,&#xD;
sweat on,-breathe on, ye toiling ones ! God sees and&#xD;
marks. There is a brighter world, a fairer clime.&#xD;
Trust in HIM. He counts the throbbings of your hearts.&#xD;
May He touch the hearts of wealthy philanthropists,-&#xD;
give them bowels of compassion,-to spend less on&#xD;
their pampered lusts in fir n furniture, extravagant&#xD;
living, to talk less, and do more, to afford you greater&#xD;
independence, and lift you from your slavery,-the&#xD;

&#xD;
slavery of injustice, the slavery of the lowest pittance,&#xD;
the grinding poverty of meagre wages !&#xD;
Ah! we have seen sights, even in the great metrop-&#xD;
olis of this happy land. Looking from our room win-&#xD;
dow in our hotel, which opened on bricks on all sides,&#xD;
during the extreme heat of the past summer, (which&#xD;
was so intense, that, during a walk of two squares on&#xD;
Broadway, we saw as many as four horses fall in the&#xD;
streets, panting for life,) at the early dawn, ere yet the&#xD;
full glare of day had broken upon this mass of bricks&#xD;
and living creatures, we witnessed a scene never to be&#xD;
effaced from our memory. My window opened on a&#xD;
vacant space, a court about ten feet square ; on either&#xD;
side, rose the brick walls, full four stories high; at the&#xD;
bottom, were scattered, here and there, fragments of&#xD;
broken bottles, and old lumber and rags, among which&#xD;
a lone rat, at that early hour, rummaged for his scant&#xD;
supply of food. We pitied the poor rat, when we&#xD;
beheld his slim prospect of his morning's meal. Musing&#xD;
on him and his fate, we had lost sight of a frail tene-&#xD;
ment which occupied the centre of the court. The rat,&#xD;
suddenly pricking up his ears, and running for his hole,&#xD;
called'our attention to other objects.&#xD;
In the centre of the court, there was a sort of cabin&#xD;
or glass-house, a mere frame-work, somewhat after.the&#xD;
plan of the frame-work of a hot-bed, filled with glass on&#xD;
the sides and glass over head, to admit freely the rays&#xD;
of light, and constructed with doors on either side to&#xD;
admit the air which might steal over the towering roof,&#xD;
and find its way down to that dark, pent-up place. As&#xD;
the rat fled, a door opened, and two human beings took&#xD;
their seats in their glass-house, far down below me, and&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
commenced plying their needles with marked industry.&#xD;
"They that live in glass-houses - should not throw&#xD;
stones," especially they who work in them should not ;&#xD;
for should they break a pane, it would cost more than&#xD;
a day's work, and give them many pains in return.&#xD;
But we can throw a stone for them, which, we trust,&#xD;
will be as true as was David's, from his sling at the&#xD;
champion Goliath, of Gath,-not, indeed, to kill men,&#xD;
but to kill their selfs/hness, their pretensions,-kill&#xD;
wanting, hypocritical philanthropy,-demolish these&#xD;
glass-houses, open the eyes of the blind, (who yet say&#xD;
they see,) to the wants of man as they really are, and&#xD;
to the great bleeding heart of humanity.&#xD;
Now, follow out these two beings from their glass-&#xD;
house,-take that living mass from the factory and the&#xD;
blazing furnace, and view their condition in a religious&#xD;
aspect. Where do you find them on the Lord's day?&#xD;
Do you behold them in groups and crowds, hurrying&#xD;
to the sanctuary to offer up the earliest and latest&#xD;
prayer to Him from whom all good things do come?&#xD;
Nay; scarcely a moiety of that vast number are striving&#xD;
for a better world ; scarcely a moiety of them have any&#xD;
sense of religion. The church-bell has no music for&#xD;
the ears of the majority ; indeed, over them, it is to be&#xD;
feared, infidelity rules and reigns. And the reason is,&#xD;
they are not cared for! We are reciting facts,-facts&#xD;
of which we are cognizant. Infidelity, Deism, prevails&#xD;
fearfully among this class of the citizens of this great&#xD;
Republic. We have met with men who were frank&#xD;
enough to tell us, that from long confinement to their&#xD;
peculiar employments, neglect of the sanctuary, and&#xD;
want of intercourse with their fellow-men, and the&#xD;

&#xD;
sympathies springing out of it, they had not only grown&#xD;
misanthropic, but had actually learned to hate the&#xD;
sound of the church-bell,-to hate the very word&#xD;
Religion! And they have accounted to me for it, in&#xD;
this way: Their employment is monotonous ; they&#xD;
have nothing to exercise the mind, to keep it active, in&#xD;
things good and elevating. And yet the mind will be&#xD;
employed. They grow meditative, are wrapped up in&#xD;
their own thoughts ; the everlasting whirl and the&#xD;
racket of the machinery drive them, as it were, into&#xD;
themselves. They see that they are little cared for;&#xD;
they grow melancholy, and nurse their morbid feelings,&#xD;
until finally they yield themselves up to the temptations&#xD;
of the evil one, and become hardened in open, avowed&#xD;
infidelity ! And especially is this apt to be the case&#xD;
with foreigners.&#xD;
We have frequently met with individuals from Eng-&#xD;
land, who had been reared up, we may say, at the al-&#xD;
tars of her noble and glorious Church, but who, on&#xD;
removing to this country, soon fell into the meshes of&#xD;
infidelity, or some of the ruinous vagaries or heresies&#xD;
for which this country is so famous. And the reason is&#xD;
this : They miss here the care and the sympathy to which&#xD;
they have been accustomed. The Church of England&#xD;
provides and cares for all classes of her children, on a&#xD;
much more extensive and systematic scale than we do,&#xD;
as we are ashamed to confess. And it is a great re-&#xD;
proach on the Church, that in all our cities there&#xD;
are not more churches, free for the use of all such,&#xD;
whether foreign or native, and more pastors to care for&#xD;
them, search them out, give them the right hand of&#xD;
sympathy and brotherly love, throw around them the&#xD;
&#xD;
34&#xD;
&#xD;
Iastoratl arm, to make them feel happy and at home!&#xD;
The -PAsTous will not be wanting; the CnuRdH's heart&#xD;
is big enough, and full enough of yearning ; but, alas!&#xD;
her yearnings are stifled, her heart is crushed, because&#xD;
her CHILDREN withhold from the Lord more than is con-&#xD;
venient ; devote their means to all the vanities of life;&#xD;
and so "rob God," while His children cry unto Him&#xD;
and them for the bread of life and the waters of salva-&#xD;
tion !&#xD;
And we all know, who take any interest in the race&#xD;
of Adam, that when men, in whatever class, lose a&#xD;
sense of religion, with it they lose all reverence for sa-&#xD;
ered things. Hence, if you would find, on the Lord's&#xD;
day, that mass of men to whom we have pointed, you&#xD;
must not seek them at God's sanctuary. But turn to&#xD;
the tavern, or tippling-shop, the steamboat or railroad&#xD;
excursion, the woods, or water, and you will see how&#xD;
that holy day is spent. No sound of praise or prayer,&#xD;
from them, makes glad the courts of heaven ; but, more&#xD;
likely, blasphemy, drunkenness, revellings, fights,&#xD;
brawls,-the open gateway to eternal ruin, the dram-&#xD;
shop, dealing out its deadly poison,-these are the&#xD;
sights which make angels veil their faces, and these the&#xD;
sounds that pierce the blue vaults of heaven, and carry&#xD;
their tale of woe up to the throne of God!&#xD;
Now, we insist upon it, that these things are so, in a&#xD;
great measure, because, with all the boasted philan-&#xD;
thropy of this age, truae charity does not walk visibly&#xD;
before us, enough ! High-sounding words, pleasant-&#xD;
reading books, answer very well in their place ; but we&#xD;
want a little more of the spirit thrown in, in the right way,&#xD;
like that which once, in one crashing voice, rang out on&#xD;

work, and do. You are ready, you say, for your part.&#xD;
Well, we want to build a free church in  street, to&#xD;
seat six hundred persons. It will cost ten thousand dol-&#xD;
lars; and then we want twelve hundred dollars per an-&#xD;
num, to feed and clothe a pastor to look after the flock.&#xD;
It is a glorious enterprise. The angels look out from&#xD;
heaven and smile upon it. Christ from His throne holds&#xD;
out an immortal crown, for every head who shall honor&#xD;
Him in this or any other work! "Oh, how glad I shall&#xD;
be, to have a share in that work ! It is a glorious work!&#xD;
And heaven-born Charity, unveiled, walks in our midst,&#xD;
seeking where she may bestow her favors ! Oh, do let&#xD;

delightful! We shall only have to make known our&#xD;
wants, and the means will be instantly supplied !" Go&#xD;
on, enthusiastic youth! May be, when your beard has&#xD;
grown you will have learned wisdom.&#xD;
Now watch him! "Let's see," says he, " on whom&#xD;
shall I call first ?" Ah, lucky thought ! There is Mr.&#xD;
A., an enthusiastic admirer of " Uncle Tom's Cabin,"-&#xD;
a great friend of humanity; a great philanthropist !&#xD;
"Well, I'll put him down for five hundred dollars."'&#xD;
"Young man, you had better be certain first !"&#xD;
Well, he calls at Mr. A..'s counting-room. " Is Mr.&#xD;
A. in ?"  "Yes."  And turning your eyes up, you see&#xD;
him at his desk, casting up accounts, or counting his&#xD;
money, or reading the money article in the morning's&#xD;
paper. He hands him his subscription-book! Mr. A.&#xD;
opens .it, gives it one eye, while he gives the other to his&#xD;
occupation! "Free church, Sir !-free church! The&#xD;

There are more-churches here now than can be support-&#xD;
ed !" "But, Mr. A., the poor must be cared for !"&#xD;
" Yes, Sir, it is true ; but I have given every dollar I&#xD;
can afford ! It is my duty, first to sustain the churches&#xD;
already in existence. There are St. J.'s, and St. P.'s,&#xD;
and St. A.'s; these congregations all are poor, and I&#xD;
do'maintain, that we should strengthen them, before&#xD;
we engage in any thing new ! Besides, there is the&#xD;
great Kossuth fund,-I have just given that one thou-&#xD;
sand dollars; and then, I have subscribed fifty dollars&#xD;
to Mr. Drinkwater's Temperance Lectures; and did&#xD;
you not see, that I am a large contributor to the&#xD;
'Uncle Tom Cabin' fund,-all, Sir, for the cause of hu-&#xD;
manity !"&#xD;
"But, Mr. A., all this does not build the house of the&#xD;
Lord." "I know that, Sir; but, Sir, humanity,-hu-&#xD;
manity, I say,-is a great cause!"&#xD;
Now, my young friend, you may give the case up&#xD;
there ! Go, visit Mrs. A. And neither will she have&#xD;
any thing to give. Mr. A. holds the-purse-strings. All&#xD;
that she can do is to get money enough to buy new fur-&#xD;
niture. "Why, just think, Sir, that mirror which shows&#xD;
your person to such an advantage, only cost two thou-&#xD;
sand dollars! Was it not cheap ?" And then it will&#xD;
take at least two hundred dollars to buy the Misses A.&#xD;
tickets to the celebrated Messrs. Humbug, Moneycatch-&#xD;
em &amp;amp; Co.'s Lectures on-NoTHING! And then there&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. LOVEGOOD ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF BIRDS.&#xD;
FROM NATURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
SKETCHES&#xD;
&#xD;
WE think it best, at this stage of our sketch, to intro-&#xD;
duce our Pastor to the reader. "Your Pastor? what&#xD;
has he to do with your sketch ?" "We shall see," we&#xD;
answer. We are writing life experiences, and life very&#xD;
often runs in crooked streams. He who writes from&#xD;
the lines of life, must often diverge from the straight&#xD;
line of the ordinary story-teller. If there appears no&#xD;
connection here, it will be seen hereafter. Let that&#xD;
suffice to quiet all murmurings.&#xD;
Our Pastor was, a very practical man,-a man of&#xD;
great learning and experience,-one of your close-&#xD;
thinking men, who, in his public ministrations and&#xD;
private intercourse with his flock, made every event in&#xD;
life, and every phenomenon in nature, in some way&#xD;
subservient to his work. No other man that ever I&#xD;
saw, was so complete a master -of the hearts of the&#xD;
young; or understood so well how to interest them, or&#xD;
to gain their affections! And this, because he had so&#xD;
happy a facility in conversing with them, on those&#xD;
commonplace topics which they best understood. He&#xD;
had evidently been a boy himself; for, he understood&#xD;
all about the making and flying of a kite, a game of&#xD;
ball or marbles, as well as any boy in Christendom.&#xD;
And it was really a treat, to get him interested in con-&#xD;

versation, on any of the pastimes of his younger days.&#xD;
Apart from the pleasure he afforded, he always instruct-&#xD;
ed,-always pointed out some new beauty, some new&#xD;
lesson of wisdom, even in those things which we&#xD;
thought we were thorough masters of.&#xD;
Well do I remember a visit he paid to the village&#xD;
school, and the interesting sketch that he .gave us, at&#xD;
the request of the tutor, on the Philosophy of Birds.&#xD;
" When I was a boy," said Mr. Lovegood, "I spent&#xD;
many days, rambling over the fields, and nursing the&#xD;
little ducks and chickens ; employments which delight-&#xD;
ed me when a youth. Many, many hours did I spend,&#xD;
in the pleasant task of watching and noting the devel-&#xD;
opments of the wonderful instincts of the poultry-yard.&#xD;
It is not strange, then, boys, that this pleasant spring&#xD;
day should bring to light some lines, long obscured on&#xD;
the table of my memory, of the peculiar traits of that&#xD;
wise little folk, the birds and domestic fowls, which I&#xD;
treasured up when a boy. This bright sunny day, and.&#xD;
the sparkling eyes and smiling faces around me, carry&#xD;
me back to the days of my youth! Man is a strange-.&#xD;
compound, and a wonderful!    And it may seem&#xD;
strange to you, a waste of time, if not absolutely non-&#xD;
sensical, to talk about the Philosophy of Birds I"&#xD;
"Philosophy of Birds !" we all exclaimed. "Who&#xD;
ever heard of such a thing !"  " That, boys, is precise-&#xD;
ly what I wish to do, -talk about something of which&#xD;
you have never heard, - something of which you&#xD;
know, perhaps, nothing." "But, Mr. Lovegood, you&#xD;
say Philosophy of Birds."  "Just so: Philosophy.&#xD;
What's in a word? I care not a fig about it, mi the&#xD;
present instance. Words are mighty things, indeed !&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.              41&#xD;
But, in the present case, I care not for the word; call&#xD;
it instinct, if you prefer it. I prefer the word I use,-=&#xD;
Philosophy. And I maintain, against you and the rest&#xD;
of the world, that birds are philosophers. They have a&#xD;
language, too !"&#xD;
" What! birds have a language ?"  "Yes! birds.&#xD;
It is true, we do not understand it. Perhaps, that is a&#xD;
boon yet in store for us, in this progressive age! You&#xD;
smile at this, as well you may; but there are men&#xD;
silly enough to undertake any thing! The barbarians&#xD;
of our own race, have a language which we do not&#xD;
understand; but our not understanding does not prove&#xD;
that they have no language ; neither does our ignorance&#xD;
of ornithological dialect, prove that birds have not a&#xD;
language. They have not our language, but they have&#xD;
one of their own. If we do not understand it, it is our&#xD;
infelicity. And it should humble us, when we reflect,&#xD;
that there is something under the sun which we do not&#xD;
understand ! Stranger ideas than this that I have&#xD;
started, have passed current in the world.&#xD;
" In the olden time, there was a system in ornitho-&#xD;
mancy,-divination by the flight and other acts of birds.&#xD;
Some remarkable stories of such things are told in the&#xD;
old classic authors, which some of these days you may&#xD;
read. Great events have turned upon the flight of a&#xD;
flock of ravens, or vultures! And even at this day,&#xD;
you know, some of the simple-minded country people&#xD;
tremble, if an unlucky crow wing his flight across their&#xD;
pathway! Two crows make a better omen, but three&#xD;
a very bad one. The shrill cry, nocturnus ululatus, of&#xD;
the Night-raven (Nycticorax) is heard with dread, as&#xD;
foreboding some dire calamity! And so the wakeful&#xD;

notes of the Whip-poor-will, at nightfall, especially if&#xD;
lie take his position in the yard or near the house,&#xD;
bring to the inmates of that house the omen of death&#xD;
But, I assure you, that I have often heard the shrill cry&#xD;
of the Night-raven, and the melancholy note of the&#xD;
Whip-poor-will, without terror, or ensuing death, or&#xD;
calamity ! And yet I believe that birds are philoso-&#xD;
pliers, and very wise ones in their way ; that they have&#xD;
a language, and understand each other, at least those of&#xD;
the same gengs.&#xD;
"When a boy, I was not unobservant of such small&#xD;
matters; and now that I am a man, and the frosts of&#xD;
age are settling on my brow, I look upon them with&#xD;
reverence, if not awe ! Then they afforded me pleas-&#xD;
ure; they now afford me food for reflection, teach me&#xD;
deep lessons of love and humility, and lift my thoughts&#xD;
and my heart up to that Great Being 'who feedeth the&#xD;
young ravens that cry unto Him,' and who, through the&#xD;
instincts of -brutes, and beasts, and fowls of the air,&#xD;
teacheth man wisdom!&#xD;
"1When young, I had a peculiar penchant for crows,&#xD;
i. e., a longing for them! It was a strange fancy. But&#xD;
boys will be boys, and every boy will have his own&#xD;
idiosyncrasy. I had mine. It was a hankering after&#xD;
crows ! But, if the truth must be told, there was a&#xD;
twofold reason for this singular fancy of mine. In the&#xD;
first place, crows are very troublesome little fellows,&#xD;
you know, boys. They will steal eggs and young&#xD;
chickens, and pluck the shoots of .corn, for the parent&#xD;
grain, as they spring out of the earth. So, my father&#xD;
proclaimed a war of extermination against the crow&#xD;
tribe. Consequently, in the second place, every dead&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
crow was a sixpence in my pocket! Marvellous things!&#xD;
'Money is the root of all evil!' It certainly was the&#xD;
root of my fondness for crows ! And, notwithstanding&#xD;
the ornithomancy of the ancients, and the superstition&#xD;
of the ignorant, it certainly was a lucky thing for me,&#xD;
and a very unlucky one for any crow whose flight lay&#xD;
across my pathway, within gun-shot, (I was a remark-&#xD;
able shot 'on the wing,')-for to him it was certain&#xD;
death, to me it was as good as a sixpence !"&#xD;
"But you tell me, crows are not philosophers."&#xD;
" Then, boys, answer me this: How is it, that I could&#xD;
approach one of these sable, glossy little fellows almost&#xD;
as near as I pleased, if only Ihad no gun in my hand -&#xD;
but, when I had that deadly weapon, I could rarely get&#xD;
within gun-shot of one ?" "True ! true !" we all&#xD;
exclaimed. " True to the life !" "They cared not for&#xD;
me, but they did for the gun."  "They smelt powder,"&#xD;
exclaimed the boys. "That is it,-they don't like&#xD;
powder !"&#xD;
"I could walk through the fields with a tobacco-&#xD;
stick, or any other bludgeon, unnoticed. But, let me&#xD;
have a gun, and Imight creep behind bushes, copy all&#xD;
the arts of war in ambush; but, as a general thing, it&#xD;
would all be useless. His crowship, a sentinel, sitting&#xD;
on some high tree looking out, would spy me, and in a&#xD;
jiffy you would hear him sing out, 'Caw, caw, caw!'&#xD;
and away they all would go, making the air ring again&#xD;
with the same cry, and laughing in their sleeve at me,&#xD;
if they happened to have one. I have witnessed this a&#xD;
thousand times."  "'So have we," said the boys. "And&#xD;
a thousand times I have felt my heart palpitate, when,&#xD;
at the moment I expected to win the prize, they have&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;

DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
been warned by the sentinel, whose sharp eye detected&#xD;
me in my hiding-place, and they have all flown off,&#xD;
making merry at my expense&#xD;
" Crows are not philosophers, eli, boys? Then I&#xD;
should like you to account for this. You see an old&#xD;
setting crow, perched on the top of a tree, or on a&#xD;
fence-stake, near the poultry-yard. There she sits, the&#xD;
very picture of 'patience sitting on a monument.'&#xD;
What does it mean? Watch yonder hen, and you&#xD;
shall see. She softly threads her way through the&#xD;
briers or leaves, or she is scratching in the straw behind.&#xD;
the barn. Her crowship looks on, well content to bide&#xD;
her time!&#xD;
The hen, too, has her philosophy ; but perhaps, in&#xD;
the present instance, it is a very foolish one. Like some&#xD;
persons we wot of, the less they know the wiser they&#xD;
think they are ! for, she has no sooner accomplished&#xD;
the great work of laying an egg, than she must tell all&#xD;
the world the wonder ; and away she goes cackling,&#xD;
and fuming, and fussing, at the top of her voice ! Now&#xD;
watch her crowship ! You hear not a word from her&#xD;
But she softly lifts her wing, and adown she sails to the&#xD;
nest ! She pauses a moment, to see that all is right.&#xD;
The crow is wonderfully circumspect, and teaches man&#xD;
a good lesson! She looks all around her, before she&#xD;
acts in such an enterprise ! Perhaps she feels guilty,&#xD;
and therefore she thinks that some wily boy may have&#xD;
placed a trap there for her destruction, as I have&#xD;
known boys to do. Therefore, she draws herself steal-&#xD;
thily up to the nest,--stands, as it were, on tiptoe,&#xD;
stretches out her neck, peeps well in,--and then,-the.&#xD;
track being clear,-I would not give much for that.&#xD;
&#xD;
egg !" "Good, good, good !" said the boys, clapping&#xD;
their hands,-" just like them !"&#xD;
aI add one other instance of the philosophy of crows.&#xD;
When they grew uncommonly wily, and yet uncommon-&#xD;
ly destructive in the corn-field, I resolved, at my father's&#xD;
suggestion, on another plan for their destruction. I&#xD;
took a large quantity of corn, and, with a needle, in-&#xD;
serted a horse-hair through the centre of each grain,&#xD;
and tied it fast. This corn, so arranged, I scattered&#xD;
broadcast over the field. 'Now,' says I, 'I guess I&#xD;
shall be too smart for you.' Well, one or two would&#xD;
pick up a grain, examine it,-it wouldn't do! He&#xD;
would set one foot on the grain, take the hair. in his&#xD;
beak, and tug away until in some way he would get it&#xD;
free ; if not, he would give it up. One fellow, less dis-&#xD;
creet, or more hungry than the rest, swallowed a grain.&#xD;
Piresently I saw he was in misery. 'Now,' says I, ' old&#xD;
fellow, you are gone !' He flew up, made a call, and&#xD;
three or four flocked about him; and the last I saw of&#xD;
them, one was tugging at the hair to pull it out of his&#xD;
throat! I gave up, in despair of catching or killing&#xD;
crows, in that way ! Crows are philosophers, boys, it is&#xD;
useless to deny it! The only way I could ever save the&#xD;
corn from them, was by rolling the grains well in tar,&#xD;
before planting. They are not fond of tar."  "No,"&#xD;
says Tom Jenkins, "it smells and tastes something like&#xD;
gunpowder, and they are afraid of it !"&#xD;
"Well, boys, I suppose a turkey-hen is not a philoso-&#xD;
pher,-a feminine philosopher ?"&#xD;
" Have you ever had your own hen, and chickens, or&#xD;
turkey and her young, to care for and nurse, as a man&#xD;
would nurse his own child? If not, you are no judge,&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; oR,&#xD;
&#xD;
It is only the real country boy who understands these&#xD;
things. Your city nursling, what knows he of the&#xD;
philosophy of fowls? Perhaps, he understands them&#xD;
on the table, if he has money enough to buy them.&#xD;
Otherwise, I trow, in these hard times,-which have&#xD;
been since the days of Adam,--he does not understand&#xD;
them even then (stand over them he never does). Un-&#xD;
derstand the philosophy of fowls! Why, one-half of&#xD;
the city dandies, swaggering under whiskers and cigars,&#xD;
have not philosophy enough to carve one, when it is&#xD;
served on the table cooked, and ready for the knife!&#xD;
"If you had been a boy when I was, and with me&#xD;
watched my turkey-lien, to find her nest, you would not&#xD;
have said that she lacked philosophy ! She never in-&#xD;
tended that I or any one else should know where it was.&#xD;
Nay, if she could hinder it, even his honor, her liege-&#xD;
lord, was not let into the secret. But, I generally ac-&#xD;
quired it by dint of effort,-by sly, stealthy movements&#xD;
and watchings. She would be with the flock, carelessly&#xD;
picking about the poultry-yard. Presently, she would&#xD;
shear off,-seem to lose all taste for society ; in fact,&#xD;
to become too fastidious or aristocratic to associate with&#xD;
others. So she would gradually work her way off from&#xD;
them; and then you would see her glide along stealthi-&#xD;
ly, now this way, then that, but never in the direction&#xD;
of her nest.&#xD;
" My position would be taken behind an old house,&#xD;
or a bunch of briers, or a tree. As she moved along, I&#xD;
altered my position, taking pains to keep out of sight,&#xD;
and at a respectful distance. If ever she saw me, it was&#xD;
enough ! 'She was only idling her time then!' ' She&#xD;
was not going to her nest !' 'Indeed, I was mistaken&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.47&#xD;
in suspecting such a thing.' ' Dear me,' she seemed to&#xD;
say, 'how is it, that I have wandered so far from my&#xD;
companions!' And she would turn about, and com-&#xD;
mence retracing her steps, with all the naivets of the&#xD;
most consummate coquette ! For a whole day, has she&#xD;
coquetted me in this way, without going to her nest.&#xD;
My only plan was, when I was detected, to make tracks&#xD;
boldly for the house. She would be watching me,-no,&#xD;
not she ! Nevertheless, I would have to make a final&#xD;
clearance, and fall upon another plan to accomplish my&#xD;
object, which was simply to return home, and take my&#xD;
position at a garret window, and look after her until she&#xD;
ceased to fear my intrusion, and then to steal out again&#xD;
and follow her up in the same sly way, or else, for that&#xD;
day, give up the attempt! .A turkey-hen is not a phi-&#xD;
losopher, eh ?&#xD;
"Then, go with me into the fields, and watch her&#xD;
movements with her young. Mark her care and watch-&#xD;
fulness. How stately is her walk; how soft her. tread,&#xD;
as the little ones run about her feet! Hear her call&#xD;
them, when she finds food; see the little ones obey that&#xD;
call. But, above all, mark that eye of hers; see it&#xD;
turned up to the heavens, in the full glare of the broil-&#xD;
ing noon-day sun, which you dare not face ! But, she&#xD;
has a thin film which she draws over her eye, and&#xD;
which protects it from the sun's.rays, yet enables her&#xD;
to see. And ever and anon, first one eye and then the&#xD;
other is turned up, to scan the high arch of the heav-&#xD;
ens; and if, perchance, kite or eagle hover near, her&#xD;
keen eye searches him out, even though he flaps his&#xD;
wing under the full blaze of the sun ! The young are&#xD;
warned, and immediately they seek a hiding-place !&#xD;

"See her again, passing, with her stately tread,&#xD;
through the fields. A snake is descried in the grass!&#xD;
O, then, such a sputtering you never heard,-' Put !-&#xD;
put !-put !-put !'-and all the young ones hurry'up&#xD;
and gather around, and stretch out their little necks,&#xD;
and gaze at the snake, answering in the same language,&#xD;
--put !--put !-put ! If any one acquainted at all with&#xD;
turkey language is near at hand, he knows the meaning&#xD;
of all this, prepares a stick, draws up, and kills the&#xD;
snake, and the fuss is ended: otherwise, having wearied&#xD;
themselves with the alarm, one by one they turn away,&#xD;
quit their grumbling and ' putting,' and go on their&#xD;
way as quietly as ever."&#xD;
"That's all true," said the boys : "we know it is."&#xD;
" O ! Mr. Lovegood," said little Ben Jones, "let me&#xD;
tell you what I saw last summer."  "Tell on Ben,"&#xD;
said Mr. Lovegood.&#xD;
"I was walking through the orchard, and I heard&#xD;
the turkeys quarrelling and 'putting,' as you say, over&#xD;
something ; and when I went up, sure enough, they&#xD;
had found a viper ! And what do you think, Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood? The viper had a toad in his mouth, whose&#xD;
head just projected out of his mouth. In a minute&#xD;
more, he would have swallowed him. I took a stick,&#xD;
struck the viper a blow, the toad sprang out of his&#xD;
mouth, and away he went as fast as he could hop, his&#xD;
little eyes almost popping out of his head, right through&#xD;
the flock of young turkeys, to their great dismay! I&#xD;
watched the toad as far as I could see him; he was&#xD;
hopping away, for his life."  "Good for you, Ben! I&#xD;
am glad to see you observant of such things. I have&#xD;
seen the same thing, when a boy, several tinles.&#xD;

know the birds of prey from those that are not. A&#xD;

so soon as a bird of the accipitris genus, which is a bird&#xD;

appearance, what a scream, and rush, and flutter, is&#xD;
immediately raised, and how all the little ones scamper&#xD;

"I have not told you the half yet, boys ; but I fear&#xD;
to tire your patience."&#xD;
"O do go on, Mr. Lovegood; it is so pleasant !'&#xD;
"Well, did you ever come suddenly on a covey of&#xD;
young partridges in a thicket? I have, very often. It&#xD;
is a beautiful sight ! I have seen the little fellows run,&#xD;
with the shell yet on the back. Walking through the&#xD;
sedge or leaves, your .ears are suddenly stunned with a&#xD;
flutter, and the scream of the parent birds, and all&#xD;
around you are twenty or more of these little fellows,&#xD;
hustling and scampering about, hither and thither ! In&#xD;

profound silence ! You see not so much as the rust-&#xD;

parents, assuring the little ones that danger is over, and&#xD;
calling them together,-' Whe-ew-whe-ew-whe-ew,'&#xD;
their little throats warble in an undertone ! If the&#xD;

THE BLEMMERToNS; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
&#xD;
A SPLENDID BALL AT MRS. BLEMMERTON 'S. REVELATIONS&#xD;
OF CHARACTER.&#xD;
TrE anxiously-eXpected night at last arrived ; and, at&#xD;
nine o'clock, I found myself, with a palpitating heart,&#xD;
at Mr. Blemmerton's door. The scenes of the past&#xD;
night had sufficed to allay many of my misgivings,&#xD;
touching my debut into the coteries of , and its&#xD;
revelations, to render me more averse to the common-&#xD;
places of that sort of life to which I was about to be in-&#xD;
troduced. For a while, I stood undetermined, whether&#xD;
I should enter or not. I wavered between desire and&#xD;
shrinking ; but, at last, I took courage,-pulled lustily&#xD;
at the bell,-and, the next moment, was ushered into a&#xD;
full blaze of light, and heard announced, in a patroniz-&#xD;
ing voice : "Jonathan Heartful, Esquire."&#xD;
What an array of elegance, fashion, and beauty met&#xD;
my eyes ! The room seemed filled with diamonds,&#xD;
sparkling and flashing in the blaze of the gorgeous chan-&#xD;
delier. But I pause not to enter into minutia. The&#xD;
reader understands all about it. Every thing was, as&#xD;
certain writers would say, comme ii faut, for such an&#xD;
occasion. The mirrors were, for all the world, like all&#xD;
fashionable mirrors in high life, and cost but little less&#xD;
than four thousand dollars. And the carpets, in beau-&#xD;
ty of style and-richness of texture, were not a whit be-&#xD;
hind other fashionable carpets of the most costly fab-&#xD;
&#xD;

rics; in short, every thing about the house, was in a&#xD;
style of elegance and magnificence, in keeping with the&#xD;
wealth of Mr. John Bleinerton, while the delectables&#xD;
for the palate composed the choicest productions of the&#xD;
four quarters of the globe. Smiling nymphs and stately&#xD;
matrons, and elderly young ladies, on the wrong side of&#xD;
thirty, in satins, silks, and velvets, of the richest styles,&#xD;
and trig, dandified gentlemen, in kids and moustaches&#xD;
of the latest fashion, all were busy, paying court to the&#xD;
pleasures and hilarities of the evening !&#xD;
Mr. Heartful felt like a caged bird, but newly im-&#xD;
prisoned, whose heart flutters at every strange sight or&#xD;
sound. "Will Mr. Heartful be presented to Mrs. Blem-&#xD;
merton ?" Mr. Heartful, covered with blushes, and trem-&#xD;
bling with modesty, is presented to Mrs. Blemmerton.&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton is very condescending, is "happy to&#xD;
have the pleasure of Mr. Ieartful's company at her en-&#xD;
tertainment. It's only a small affair,-a select few.&#xD;
The grand season has not yet arrived. Hopes Mr. H.&#xD;
will enjoy himself."&#xD;
"Mr. lleartful acknowledges himself highly compli-&#xD;
mented. Has no doubt, that he shall spend an exceed-&#xD;
ingly agreeable evening. He is but little acquainted&#xD;
with city habits and etiquette. Being but a novice,&#xD;
raw, uncouth, just from the rural districts, he expects&#xD;
merely to be a learner." " Oh, Mr. Heartful, you&#xD;
scarcely need make any apology. Your name is suffi-&#xD;
cient to introduce you into the best circles everywhere.&#xD;
The Heartfuls, of Ifeartfulville, are well known in the&#xD;
city. You are no stranger here, Sir !" Mr. Heartful is&#xD;
a little non plused; feels as though he would -rejoice to&#xD;
be in the free open country again, musing on the stars,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
listening to the low, sad song of the Whip-poor-will, or&#xD;
holding sweet converse with Nature!&#xD;
"Dele, dear !"- " This, Mr. Heartful, is my eldest&#xD;
daughter, Miss Deliah Airmyth Bleimerton. Mr.&#xD;
Heartful, my dear, of Heartfulville,-of whom  you&#xD;
heard your papa speak. Mr. lleartful is about to take&#xD;
up his residence permanently in the city, we hope !"&#xD;
" O, I hope so," says Miss Deliah Airmyth. "It will&#xD;
really be an acquisition to society !  Ah! me, pity&#xD;
knows we need it."&#xD;
Mr. Ileartful has little relish for this line of conver-&#xD;
sation, and evidently wants something to say,-looks&#xD;
innocent,-plays with his watch-guard. At last, he&#xD;
has a happy thought,-his countenance brightens up :&#xD;
"Was Miss Blemmerton ever in lleartfulville ?" "No,&#xD;
she had never had that pleasure. But she had heard a&#xD;
great deal about Ileartfulville. She believed her papa&#xD;
had a good many business transactions there; and he&#xD;
went there very often himself without taking any&#xD;
of the family, which she regi-etted. And you are from&#xD;
Ileartfulville, are you? 0, how much I should like&#xD;
to visit the place!  The society there is so excel-&#xD;
lent! The people are so polished and highly edu-&#xD;
cated !"&#xD;
Poor Mr. Heartful felt down deep in his pockets,-&#xD;
thought of his tailor, his mirror, and his boots! Could&#xD;
Miss Deliah Airmyth be in earnest, or was she quizzing&#xD;
him?&#xD;
"0 , how she would like to enjoy a ride o.n horse-&#xD;
back in the country ! She wished her papa would take&#xD;
them to IHeartfulville next summer, instead of Saratoga&#xD;
or Newport! The novelty of these latter places had&#xD;
&#xD;
worn out ; they were so tame and commonplace now,&#xD;
that they were quite tired of them!"&#xD;
"Had Mr. Heartful been to Mons. Grandsinger's con-&#xD;
c(ert ?  how  did he like it ?"  Unfortunately, Mr.&#xD;
Ieartful had not been to Mons. Grandsinger's concert.&#xD;
"Then he had missed a rare entertainment. 0, by all&#xD;
means he should not delay ! Mons. Grandsinger would&#xD;
give but two more concerts. She should go, on both&#xD;
occasions. Would not miss it for the world ! o, his&#xD;
performances are so exqisite! lHe was her beau-ideal&#xD;
of a concertant!"&#xD;
here this enlightened and edifying conversation was&#xD;
interrupted, by the approach of Mr. Blemmnierton. Mr.&#xD;
JBlemmerton is exceedingly gracious and patronizing.&#xD;
" He takes but little interest in such convivialities.&#xD;
They are fashionable, and are, therefore, highly proper,&#xD;
and -lie is pleased to see young pei'sos enjoy them-&#xD;
selves. Is happy indeed to enjoy the society of his&#xD;
friends, in such delightful entertainments; but feels&#xD;
rather out of place. Thinks he is better fitted for the&#xD;
counting-room  than the drawing-room. Takes more&#xD;
interest in the affairs of the Church. Every man, he&#xD;
thinks, has his particular talent. Just now lie is par-&#xD;
ticularly interested in the Church.&#xD;
"lHe is a vestryman of St. -----'s Church, and&#xD;
the Rector, Rev. Dr. Goodenough, has just sent in his&#xD;
resignation, on account of ill-health, and the infirmities&#xD;
- of old age. Poor man, lie hardly knows what lie is to&#xD;
do ; for, though his salary was always large, yet he&#xD;
believes, that he has saved but little, if any thing,&#xD;
having never practised economy. The expense of living&#xD;
in the city is indeed very considerable ; but you know,&#xD;

<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7334-00000029"/>&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Sir, that a clergyman needs not to be at as much&#xD;
expense as we, who have to entertain a great deal; and&#xD;
then Dr. Goodenough was so charitable, that I verily&#xD;
believe he entirely overlooked the first rule of charity,&#xD;
that 'it begins at home.' But, I do not doubt, that the&#xD;
congregation will help him along !&#xD;
"At this moment, their great trouble was, to find a&#xD;
suitable successor. So many eminent men had been&#xD;
named to them, that they were really baffled in their&#xD;
choice. Dr. Goodenough was very eloquent and pop-&#xD;
ular.  Their congregation was large, wealthy, and&#xD;
intelligent, and there was a great variety of tastes to&#xD;
be satisfied; therefore, it required a peculiar man to&#xD;
fit the place exactly ; and it was a nice point, to select&#xD;
a clergyman who could please all tastes and all parties&#xD;
interested. The Rev. Dr. Skyrocket had been named&#xD;
to them, as an exceedingly pleasing and captivating&#xD;
preacher ; one of the most entertaining men to be&#xD;
found: his thoughts are always original and brilliant;&#xD;
and he is so poetical, that one is always enraptured with&#xD;
the beauties of his composition ! And a gentleman&#xD;
from the neighborhood of Mr. lleartful's native place&#xD;
had spoken of a Rev. Mr. Lovegood, as one of the best&#xD;
pastors, and most eloquent of preachers, that he ever&#xD;
had heard. But, we know nothing of him,-never&#xD;
heard of him before. And it is strange that we have&#xD;
not, if he is so great a man! .Still, as he has been so&#xD;
highly spoken of, by a gentleman in whose judgment I&#xD;
place confidence, I have determined to invite him to&#xD;
preach for us, that the congregation may judge how&#xD;
they would like him!"&#xD;
" A trial sermon, I suppose, as it is called ?" ''"Just&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              57&#xD;
so: a trial sermon. The congregation would like to&#xD;
judge of his style and voice, you know. For my part,&#xD;
I care not so much about matter and manner, as I do&#xD;
about voice. I detest one of your squeaking, wheezing&#xD;
voices !" "Then I know you need not invite Mr. Love-&#xD;
good to do any such thing !" "Ah ! you know him, do&#xD;
you, Mr. Ileartful ?" "I do; he has been my pastor&#xD;
for ten years 1"  "You don't say so! Do tell! How&#xD;
glad I am that you are acquainted with him! And he&#xD;
wouldn't come to preach a trial sermon, which might&#xD;
make him Rector of St.        's Church!"  "No,&#xD;
Sir, not to be made the Potentate of the world,!" "Do&#xD;
tell ! That is so strange !"&#xD;
"Not at all, Mr. Elemmerton. At least, Mr. Love-&#xD;
good would tell you so. I have often heard him express&#xD;
his opinion on this subject. And I know he has refused&#xD;
many such invitations. He thinks it beneath the dignity&#xD;
of his office. I have heard him say, that he would feel&#xD;
but little removed from the office of the mountebank in&#xD;
such an engagement, and that he had degraded his&#xD;
office."  " Bless me, it is so singular ! Why, a num-&#xD;
ber of the clergy doso ; indeed, the clergy of all the&#xD;
Church 01)"&#xD;
" I know not, precisely, what that last sentence&#xD;
means, Mr. Blemmerton. But, Mr. Lovegood does not&#xD;
pattern after the sects. His opinion is simply, that it&#xD;
is unbecoming, to preach what are called trial-sermons.&#xD;
He think the general character and reputation of a&#xD;
clergyman ought to be quite sufficient; that the hearing&#xD;
of a clergyman preach, is not a sufficient criterion to&#xD;
judge of his qualities as a pastor. If a clergyman is&#xD;
free from reproach, is faithful in the discharge of his&#xD;
&#xD;

58      THE BLEMMER ToNS; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
duties, has strength of mind and body for the fulfilment&#xD;
of the duties of any post for which he may be recomi-&#xD;
mended by those whose judgments are reliable,-these&#xD;
ought to be sufficient data for any congregation to base&#xD;
their call upon. These, at all events, are his views.&#xD;
He may be a little singular in them, but I know he&#xD;
will not depart from them ; he would not, I think,&#xD;
accept a call to any parish, on any other grounds."&#xD;
" Then you know him well ?" " I do, Sir. And all&#xD;
I know about the Church, I know from him !"  " Well,&#xD;
what for a preacher is he ?"  "As a preacher, I con-&#xD;
sider him in. the first rank. But, Mr. Blemmerton, I&#xD;
cannot judge for your fastidious, sentimental congrega-&#xD;
tion. Such, at least, I take it to be, from your repre-&#xD;
sentation. You say their tastes are various ; and, in a&#xD;
multitude of tastes, there will be differences. What&#xD;
pleases one, will likely displease another. I consider&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood very eloquent as a preacher, and so do&#xD;
all his congregation. Our tastes, in this respect, are a&#xD;
unit. But we consider this, if any thing, his least&#xD;
excellence. It is as a pastor, going in and out among&#xD;
his people, that they mostly admire and love him.&#xD;
There is but one opinion and one feeling in regard to&#xD;
him at home, among all ages, classes, and conditions ;&#xD;
lie is loved and reverenced as a father !"&#xD;
" Ah! Mr. Heartful, that, after all, is what we want,&#xD;
a clergyman who will be popular, and beloved by all.&#xD;
Well, really, your account of Mr. Lovegood is quite&#xD;
gratifying. He must be an 'Evangelical,' of the real&#xD;
grit! But is he a D. D. ?" "No, he is not a D. D. He&#xD;
covets no distinctions. I doubt whether he ever thought&#xD;
of such a thing. But, if ever a clergyman deserved&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.               59&#xD;
that title, le does. And yet it could add nothing to&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood's usefulness. It would make him not a&#xD;
whit abler as a divine, nor render him more lovely and&#xD;
venerable in the estimation of his congregation. lIe&#xD;
is an humble-mind ed, faithful mai,-earnest, pathetic,&#xD;
tender, even as a father among his children. But he&#xD;
knows how to be sharp, when lie finds it necessary.  lHe&#xD;
is no hireling to flee, as the craven coward, when the&#xD;
wolf comet !"&#xD;
"But, Mr. 11eartful, are you sure that lie is an Evan-&#xD;
gelical,-are you sure that he is not a Puseyite?" " Ah!&#xD;
Sir, that I cannot tell you ; for I know not what you&#xD;
understand .by evanigelicalismn. I know, that Mr. Love-&#xD;
good recognizes the Prayer-Book, from lid to lid, as the&#xD;
Church's expositor of Ioly Writ, and that lie neither&#xD;
transcends nor fills below its teachings ; but, holds it to&#xD;
bc his authorized guide, in the interpretation of Scrip-&#xD;
ture and his pastoral duties. This cain hardly consti-&#xD;
tute him a Puseyite,-(unless you use that term as&#xD;
synonymous with Churchman,)-but does, I apl)rehend,&#xD;
constitute him  a sound, thorough Churchman, and,&#xD;
according to my theory, a tthoroughlly evangelical&#xD;
teacher ! Puseyism is something I never heard Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood speak of; and I confess, that, though I have&#xD;
often heard the cognomen spitefully used, I have never&#xD;
heard it technically explained, nor have I even taken&#xD;
the pains to endeavor' to ascertain exactly what is&#xD;
meant by it. Perhaps, if you can tell its meaning, I&#xD;
nMay be able more satisfactorily to answer your ques-&#xD;
tion I!"&#xD;
" Well, let mec see. Ah, well ! It means,-I don't&#xD;
kmiow that I can tell! I do not profess to be much&#xD;

versed in such matters. I could tell you all about my&#xD;
bank books and bills, and my rent-roll ! Put, really,-&#xD;
ha! ha! ha !-I am not posted vp, as they say on&#xD;
'Change, in such matters! Oh, yes, that's it,-Mrs.&#xD;
iBlenunerton can tell ! Mrs. Bllemmerton !" " What,&#xD;
my dear ?"  "iDo tell us, what Puseyism means ! Mr.&#xD;
Heartful and I have been talking about Church affairs,&#xD;
and strange to tell, neither of us knows exactly what&#xD;
Puseyism is ! And I am sure it is not to be wondered&#xD;
at, for Mr. Heartful is not yet fully initiated into all&#xD;
the ways of the city, and I have but little time for&#xD;
any thing except business.  Ha! ha! ha !   I just&#xD;
told Mr. Heartful, if it were a question of bank books,&#xD;
bills, and rent-rolls, I could answer him! Now do tell&#xD;
us, my dear, for you have more time for such things&#xD;
than we."&#xD;
" O certainly, my dear! Let me see. I heard Mrs.&#xD;
Wise Grumbler,-she, you know, who left St.  's&#xD;
Church because they had prayers every day in the&#xD;
week, which she says is rank Puseyism,-well, I heard&#xD;
her say, that these Puseyites have been much talked&#xD;
about of late, as having done a great deal of harm in&#xD;
the Church ! They are very Romish, too, in their ten-&#xD;
dencies ! And we abhor Romanism! They lay gieat&#xD;
stress on the sacraments, especially on baptism, and&#xD;
undervalue preaching. They also preach what is called&#xD;
the Apostolic succession, which, old Aunt Sally Milk-&#xD;
andwater stands to it, unchurches all the other Churches..&#xD;
And then, as Dele Airimyth said that Dr. Riproarer said&#xD;
(we are charitable, Mr. Heartful, and go to all the&#xD;
Churches) in his sermon last Sunday night, the Puseyite&#xD;
clergy are so exceedingly faithful in the discharge of&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.               61&#xD;
their duties, in looking after the poor, in watching over&#xD;
their congregations, that nothing escapes their eye; and&#xD;
they. make themselves so winning and fascinating by&#xD;
their kindnesses, that the people are in danger of being&#xD;
carried right smack into Rome, before they are aware&#xD;
of it,-and so he warned his flock against their insinu-&#xD;
ations!"&#xD;
" Well, if faithfulness constitutes a clergyman a&#xD;
Puscyite, then is Mr. Lovegood a thorough Puseyite!&#xD;
And I just said, that he held the Prayer-Book, and&#xD;
certainly he could not do that, and deny or fail to hold&#xD;
'and teach the Apostolic succession !" " Oh, Sir, pardon&#xD;
me ! I don't think Mrs. Blemmerton meant that, nox&#xD;
did Dr. IRiproarer intend to be so understood. But he&#xD;
must have meant, that they were so zealous, that the&#xD;
people, in their zeal, lost sight of their true character&#xD;
and peculiar notions, and so they gradually introduced&#xD;
them."&#xD;
" Ah, you mean, they catch the people with guile.&#xD;
There must be a great many guileful clergymen in the&#xD;
Church, if all who hold the Apostolic succession, lay&#xD;
great stress on the sacraments, and are in favor of daily&#xD;
prayers in the Church, have been inveigled into these&#xD;
notions by their craftiness. And what a beautiful guile-&#xD;
fulness it is. The Church has always been full of it.&#xD;
Trace her history where you may, and you behold its&#xD;
marks. She copied it from the Apostles, who taught&#xD;
the Apostolic succession, laid great stress on the sacra-&#xD;
ments, and had daily prayers ! St. Paul was full of&#xD;
this same guile ; and once had it insinuated of him,&#xD;
that he caught the people with guile. 'I did not bur-&#xD;
den you; nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with&#xD;

62         THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
guile,' 2 Cor. xii. 15. But, he replies to the implied&#xD;
insinuation, and nobly vindicates himself. In refusing&#xD;
to be burdensome to you myself, it was only a stroke&#xD;
of policy, you say ! Be it so. But I ask: ' Did I make&#xD;
a gain of you, by any of them whom I- sent to you?&#xD;
Did Titus make a gain of you? Walked we not in the&#xD;
same spirit ? Walked we not in the same steps? 1 C'or.&#xD;
xii. 17, 18. Wherein, then, was the guile, unless in&#xD;
good works and self-denial, in refusing to be burden-&#xD;
some to them in pecuniary or temporal matters? But&#xD;
hear him further, in his noble vindication : ' Again,&#xD;
think you that we excuse ourselves unto you? We&#xD;
speak before God in Christ; but we do all things, dearly&#xD;
beloved, for your edifying.'&#xD;
"And so, Mr. Blemmerton, to answer your question&#xD;
as fully as I am able, if Mr. Lovegood be one of the&#xD;
guileful ones, his guile is like that of the Apostle! le&#xD;
as cordially abhors the errors of Romanism, as any&#xD;
man. In truth, he is no friend of error anywhere, un-&#xD;
der whatever cloak or colors. But, his zeal against&#xD;
error is intelligent, and tempered with prudence and&#xD;
discretion. le knows what he is about. He does not&#xD;
beat the air, nor use language that lie does not under-&#xD;
stand. le appreciates the grounds of true Catholicism,&#xD;
and meets and opposes Rome on those grounds. He is&#xD;
not run mad, fighting shadows. He does not rashly&#xD;
reject any thing, simply because Rome happens to hold&#xD;
it; but, what he rejects, he rejects because it is not&#xD;
true, not a part of the one Holy Catholic Faith, whether&#xD;
it be found in Rome or Geneva ! Nor has he any sym-&#xD;
pathy with those whose faces are Rome-wards,--or&#xD;
looking towards, and longing after Geneva ! lie wishes,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.              ,63&#xD;
that if any such remain behind in the Church, they&#xD;
would hasten to make their exit.&#xD;
" He finds the one Holy Catholic Faith whole and&#xD;
entire in the Church, without the additions of Rome, or&#xD;
the subtractions of Geneva ; and to this he clings. te&#xD;
laments the mistaken policy and false step of the few,&#xD;
who have gone out from us to join the ranks of Rome&#xD;
and the sects. But, their rashness and folly, I can&#xD;
safely say, will never shake his confidence in the&#xD;
Church, as to her possession and profession of the truth,&#xD;
nor cause him to swerve, one jot or tittle, in the&#xD;
proclamation of the doctrines of the Church, as they&#xD;
have been handed down from the beginning, and are&#xD;
defined in the teachings of the Prayer-Book,-the Lit-&#xD;
urgy, Offices, Articles, and Homilies. Neither does&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood undervalue preaching, but rather insists&#xD;
upon it as a Divine institution, wherein he himself sets a&#xD;
most worthy example, as an apt and skilful divider of&#xD;
the words of life. He does, indeed, lay great stress on&#xD;
the sacraments, just as the Scriptures do. But I never&#xD;
heard him deliver a sermon, on either of the sacra-&#xD;
m ents, in which he did not show conclusively, that his&#xD;
doctrine corresponded with the Scripture and the Prayer=&#xD;
Book. And surely this ought to be sufficient for any&#xD;
Churchmen !"&#xD;
Thus far, upon the whole, notwithstanding the an-&#xD;
noyance of the foregoing conversation, Mr. Heartful had&#xD;
spent an agreeable evening: for, nothing could have&#xD;
been more congenial, than to speak of his beloved pas-&#xD;
tor, and the Church which he loved so well, and appre-&#xD;
ciated so truly.&#xD;

Haven't you been introduced yet?   Well, go round&#xD;
towards papa, and as soon as he sees you he will intro-&#xD;

of her papa. "0, Julia, dear, you are not acquaint-&#xD;
ed with Mr. Heartful!- Mr. Heartful, this is my young-&#xD;
est daughter, Miss Julia Jasper Blemmerton."&#xD;
And Mr. Heartful has the distinguished honor of&#xD;
standing in the presence of the belle of the family.&#xD;
"Miss Julia Jasper is quite fatigued, from the exercises&#xD;
of the evening,"-seeks a sofa. Mr. Hleartful, of course,&#xD;
follows suit. "Does Mr. Heartful dance ?"  " No,-&#xD;
that is an accomplishment that Mr. Heartful is not mas-&#xD;
ter of. In fact, he has no taste for it."  "Miss Julia&#xD;
Jasper is surprised. Really, she could not live with-&#xD;
out dancing. She pities any one who is not fond of&#xD;
dancing."  "Mr. H. is obliged for her commiseration."&#xD;
Miss Julia Jasper smiles approvingly.&#xD;
" What amusements afford Mr. IT. the most pleas-&#xD;
ure ?"  "Mr. Heartful is not addicted to any particu-&#xD;
lar amusements. He rides out occasionally, for exer-&#xD;
cise, and spends his leisure hours in reading." " Oh&#xD;
dear, reading to me is such a bore, unless I get hold of&#xD;
a really spicy novel. And a spicy -novel is so rare;&#xD;
most of the light reading of the present day is so&#xD;
trashy !" "Mr. Heartful agrees with Miss Julia Jas-&#xD;
per, that there is a great amount of lightness in much&#xD;
of the current light literature. But, he suggests, that&#xD;
she might find something more entertaining, in the&#xD;
works of substantial merit and usefulness. Something&#xD;

affording it solid instruction. At best, he thought&#xD;
nothing more than the poetry of life was to be found in&#xD;
sentimental works." "But, Miss Julia Jasper had so&#xD;
much to do with substantials at school, that she is&#xD;
heartily sick and tired of them."&#xD;
And the belle of the family is threatened with a fit&#xD;
of nervousness, at the bare mention of sound, solid,&#xD;
wholesome reading. Mr. Heartful feared, though he&#xD;
kept his fears to himself, that the extent of Miss Julia&#xD;
Jasper's education consisted in dancing a waltz or two,&#xD;
or drumming a few notes on the piano. He doubted&#xD;
whether she had ever read, understandingly, half a doz-&#xD;
en books in her life.&#xD;
" But Miss Julia Jasper was passionately fond of mu-&#xD;
sic. She practised two hours, every evening that they&#xD;
hadn't company. Last evening, she was ridiculously&#xD;
interrupted, in the midst of a most enrapturing piece of&#xD;
music; and she had been in an ill humor ever since,&#xD;
which she really thought pardonable. Mamma had&#xD;
given the servants leave of absence a while, that eve-&#xD;
ning, and there was no one to answer the bell; and, in&#xD;
the very midst of my music, the bell rang. I hurried&#xD;
to the door, and oh ! just to think, it was only a little&#xD;
urchin who wanted to see papa ! Now, wasn't that&#xD;
provoking ?"  "Was it a boy or girl ?" "Oh! a little&#xD;
ragged, barefooted girl. Dear me, Sir, the city is full&#xD;
of them. There is no living in peace for them. I do&#xD;
wish we could get where there are no beggars! I think&#xD;
Dives must have grown accustomed to them. And one&#xD;
half of them are impostors. It is a great pity the po-&#xD;
lice do not look after themm" "What did the little&#xD;

story. Her mother was sick, and her father was dying.&#xD;
Wanted to see papa. Her father lived in one of his houses,&#xD;
and she wanted to see papa about the rent, -wanted&#xD;
hin to give it up, I reckon. It was the sixth time she&#xD;
had been to the door, within the last three days. And&#xD;
she had been told, again and again, not to annoy us.&#xD;
Oh, the impudence of these people !"&#xD;
" Did she see your papa ?" " No. Papa was not in;&#xD;
and if he had been, it would have been all the same.&#xD;
He has lost a great deal of rent by that man; and I&#xD;
heard him say, that he did not intend to lose any more.&#xD;
Besides, papa says, the expense of living is becoming&#xD;
so great, that he can't afford to be over-iiidulgent. We&#xD;
must dress in the fashion, you know, Mr. Hleartful; and&#xD;
ma must give parties, and furnish her house like other&#xD;
people. She had as well be out of the world as out of&#xD;
the fashion ! And if papa listened to the stories of all&#xD;
these people, he would never get a penny of rent from&#xD;
one of them. And a large portion of his income is&#xD;
from the rent of his houses in the occupancy of that&#xD;
class. These little beggar girls are very expert. They&#xD;
can cry, just when they please. I wish you could have&#xD;
been here, to see how lustily she cried, and wrung her&#xD;
hands, just as though she was in earnest. How admni-&#xD;
rably they would act on the stage ! They are ahead of&#xD;
nature. It's by long practice, Sir; and practice makes&#xD;
Perfectt"&#xD;
" But, Miss Julia Jasper, I think it highly probable,&#xD;
that that little girl was not an impostor. May it not&#xD;
have been, that she really had at home a sick mother,&#xD;
and a dying father, and came to inmplore mercy ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.  67&#xD;
&#xD;
"0O, no, Sir! I have no confidence in any of them.&#xD;
They are so well drilled in imposture, that you never&#xD;
know how to place confidence in any of them. You&#xD;
have not lived here long enough yet, Mr. Ileartful, to&#xD;
understand theni"&#xD;
'"I have lived here long enough to witness much&#xD;
of wretchedness, much of misery and sorrow. Had&#xD;
you been with me, last night, as I followed a lone,&#xD;
little barefooted, beggar girl to her home of poverty;&#xD;
had you, with me, entered that home of wretchedness,&#xD;
and, with me, witnessed the dying agonies of that father,&#xD;
and heard the heavy sighing of the sick mother, and&#xD;
looked upon that mute, crushed, half-clad, half-starved&#xD;
child, destitute of food or fuel, and listened to the dying&#xD;
man's tale of woe, of long years of penury and pinch-&#xD;

angels of mercy in the world, fulfilling the law of chari-&#xD;

for utterance. " Parvi afffectus loquuntur, magni ta-&#xD;

elm, which so gracefully spread its branches before his&#xD;
father's door! 0 for that quiet, unsophisticated, pure&#xD;
home of his childhood, where the tainted breath of&#xD;
worldliness mingled not, to mar the breathings of the&#xD;
pure in heart! And this was a sample of fashionable&#xD;
life,-life in the world. Life, life, said he, half aloud,&#xD;
how many shades mingle in thy picture ! Memories of&#xD;
the past gushed into his full heart, carrying him back&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
A FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF THE BLEM-&#xD;
MERTONS. A VESTRY MEETING. OBSTINATE PEOPLE.&#xD;
MR. HEARTFUL had pretty thoroughly read the Blem'&#xD;
mertons. Mrs. and the Misses B. were but gilded but-&#xD;
terflies, making a desperate effort at appearances,&#xD;
striving for a position among the 6lite and fashionable,&#xD;
-the aristocratic, as they termed them,-without any&#xD;
other qualification than that of wealth, to back their&#xD;
pretensions. Nevertheless, wealth is potent and covers&#xD;
a multitude of blemishes; and, backed by it, they were&#xD;
gradually edging their way into the best society. It is,&#xD;
then, not to be wondered at, that minds constituted as&#xD;
theirs were, should be elated by the dignity of their&#xD;
position, and dazzled by the importance which they&#xD;
supposed attached to their name ! Their highest ambi-&#xD;
tion was to be popular, to be accounted liberal-minded,&#xD;
and of importance in society,-to bask a brief day in&#xD;
the sunshine of worldly folly and fashion, while morally&#xD;
they remained devoid of even a single principle to meet&#xD;
the stern realities of life, and possessed but few, if any,&#xD;
of those marked traits of character which constitute the&#xD;
true woman, and fit her for her sphere of dignity and&#xD;
usefulness as an angel of love and mercy in the world.&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton had worked his way from extreme&#xD;
poverty up to wealth. But he had long since forgotten&#xD;
the humility of his younger days. Dollars and cents&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7334-00000036"/>&#xD;
w&#xD;
&#xD;
70&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BLEMMERToNs; oR,&#xD;
&#xD;
were every thing in his estimation, and were all that&#xD;
gave a man importance. Dollars and cents, he was&#xD;
pretty sure, could move the world. Had Archimedes&#xD;
possessed his philosophy, he would not have been&#xD;
baffled in his problem.&#xD;
Possessing this powerful lever, he was willing to use&#xD;
it to the full extent of the ambition of his wife and&#xD;
daughters.  Purse-proud, he doubted not that his&#xD;
wealth gave him importance and influence in the&#xD;
Church, and he wished to magnify himself in the eyes&#xD;
of Mr. Ifeartful. But if Mr. H. understood but little of&#xD;
the ways and workings of what Mrs. Blemmerton with&#xD;
affected na'ivete termed high life, he did understand&#xD;
something about the Church. He was not long in dis-&#xD;
covering that Mr. B. was no Churchman; and this in&#xD;
no invidious sense. His churchmanship was not siniply&#xD;
meager and of a low standard in the estimation of Mr.&#xD;
U., but,-to be guilty intentionally of writing what&#xD;
may be considered an unmeaning sentence,-it was&#xD;
absolutely nothing ; as More would write, it was a&#xD;
nihility. Had he been imbued with any, even the&#xD;
least spark of real love of the Church, though lie might&#xD;
have entertained views which Mr. H. could not have&#xD;
sanctioned, yet would he have left him much more&#xD;
favorably impressed. He could and would have&#xD;
esteemed him for his sincere affection for the Church&#xD;
and religion, and have extended to him such a measure&#xD;
of confidence and regard as he found he deserved.&#xD;
But, alas ! there was no such element in Mr. Blemmer-&#xD;
ton's character. He had no interest in any thing that&#xD;
did not minister to his own and his family's ambition.&#xD;
He was a pure worldling, and took the world for his&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
71&#xD;
&#xD;
measure and reward. It was simply for fashion's sake&#xD;
that he had taken a pew in St.      's Church. It&#xD;
brought the Blemmertons into notice. It made a&#xD;
pleasant Sunday's resort, afforded Mrs. and the Misses&#xD;
13. a theme for the week's gossip, and enabled them to&#xD;
see the fashions and display their wealth in their gor-&#xD;
geous attire. It gave them an uppish look and ten-&#xD;
dency.&#xD;
Having mastered, as he supposed, a few cant phrases&#xD;
of the day, such as "Evangelical" and " Puseyite," in&#xD;
these he vested his stock of theological knowledge, and&#xD;
fancied himself almost, if not quite, a Doctor in&#xD;
Divinity&#xD;
"Evangelical" preaching, in his mind, was merely&#xD;
a dandyizing performance in the pulpit, in which there&#xD;
mingled an occasional flash of lightning and a peal of&#xD;
thunder,-with as little of' sulphur as, possible. And&#xD;
"evangelical" doctrine was that which merely dealt in&#xD;
generals, discoursed at large on the beauties and excel-&#xD;
lences of the Gospel, talked about grace and the&#xD;
WOIRLD's sinfulness, gave the old enemy a sound thresh-&#xD;
ing occasionally, avoided indoctrinating, especially on&#xD;
such out-of-the-way, unpopular subjects as the Church,&#xD;
the ministry, and the sacraments; and always avoided,&#xD;
as far as possible, coming down with the power and&#xD;
energy of that sentence which makes a shaking of the&#xD;
dry bones, as of the Lord's Spirit passing over them,-&#xD;
Thou art the man !"&#xD;
In short, " evangelical" preaching, in Mr.,Blemmer-&#xD;
ton's estimation, was merely a shooting at sin on the&#xD;
wing, but never cornering it up ; never following it into&#xD;
a man's counting-room, or parlor, or even into his pew!&#xD;

TnE ELEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
No, no ; this would not answer for Mr. Blemmerton.&#xD;
His conscience was his citadel; it was sacred ; it must&#xD;
not be disturbed. Clergymen should not be pointed&#xD;
nor personal. They are not hired for that ! but to&#xD;
preach, so as to tickle the fancy,-please the poetical&#xD;
imagination of the Blemmertons and such like grandees!&#xD;
As to a clergyman's coming right to the point, and&#xD;
making every man feel his particular sinfulness, hold-&#xD;
ing before him a mirror in which he might behold&#xD;
himself; ah! this never crossed his mind.  And to&#xD;
his mind all, or nearly all, was "Puseyism," that did&#xD;
not exactly fit his measure of " Evangelicalisin."&#xD;
Now, it must be told,. that the Vestry of St. 's&#xD;
Church were not all Blemmertons. Nay, they were&#xD;
right-hearted, right-minded men,--ien who loved and&#xD;
appreciated the Church, and esteemed those who were&#xD;
over them in the Lord, very highly in love for their&#xD;
work's sake. 1 Thess. v. 13. But, by hook or by&#xD;
crook, Mr. Blemmerton had worked himself in among&#xD;
them, and was now vain enough to think, that all&#xD;
responsibility rested on his shoulders. Consequently,&#xD;
he was just now wonderfully puffed up with his impor-&#xD;
tance in the Church. And the task of supplying St.&#xD;
's Church with a Rector, was no insignificant&#xD;
one. If he could do it, it would be " a feather in his&#xD;
cap  of no ordinary beauty and brilliancy. He was&#xD;
but little pleased with Mr. Heartful's account of the&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Lovegood, on the whole. Yet, full of vanity,&#xD;
desiring to manifest his importance and influence to&#xD;
the other members of the Vestry and to the congrega-&#xD;
tion, it struck him that it would be a capital stroke of&#xD;
policy, if, he could get the start pf his colleagues, and&#xD;
&#xD;
introduce the Rev. Mr. Lovegood to the congregation,&#xD;
in the pulpit, the Sunday or so following.&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton slept but little, that night. Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood, the Church, the Vestry, his own conse-&#xD;
quence,-especially the last, weighed heavily on his&#xD;
mind, and chased Morpheus from his pillow. The&#xD;
matter was duly discussed with Mrs. Blemmerton. She&#xD;
entirely agreed, that his plan was excellent. "Just the&#xD;
thing!" said she. "We are as much entitled to an&#xD;
opinion as any one. We pay a hundred dollars a year&#xD;
for our pew, and I am sure we are worth nearly as&#xD;
much as all the i'est of the Vestry put together. And&#xD;
if I were you, I'd have my way !" This was enough.&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton knew all the fashions, and certainly&#xD;
she could not be mistaken on this point. And Julia&#xD;
Jasper and Deliah Airmyth were just as decided in&#xD;
sustaining the resolution!&#xD;
Early the next morning Mr. Blemmerton wrote and&#xD;
despatched the following epistle:&#xD;
November -, 18-.&#xD;
"REv. S1 --The Rev. Dr. Goodenough having&#xD;
resigned the IRectorship of St.  's Church in this&#xD;
city, and the congregation being desirous of filling his&#xD;
place with a suitable preacher, and your name having&#xD;
been favorably mentioned to me, this is to request, that&#xD;
you will preach for us, .either on next Sunday, or the&#xD;
Sunday following, as may best suit your convenience.&#xD;
Enclosed please find $10 to pay your expenses.&#xD;

After despatching the aforesaid letter, Mr. B. felt&#xD;
relieved of a great burden. He could now proceed to&#xD;
business. The thing was done. He was in a good&#xD;
humor,-fully satisfied with himself. He chuckled&#xD;
over the idea.  Mr. Ileartful !-Pshaw ! he knew&#xD;
nothing about human nature. Won't come to preach&#xD;
a trial sermon for the Rectorship of St.       's&#xD;
church!   Poh, poh, poh, nonsense !  We shall see.&#xD;
Human nature is human nature, all the world over.&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton is interrupted in his revery, by a&#xD;
lad who bears a note. It was from one of the wardens,&#xD;
calling a meeting of the Vestry of St.  's Church'&#xD;
the next evening. "Ileigh-ho ! what does this mean&#xD;
quoth Mr. Blemmerton. "A Vestry meeting, eh!,&#xD;
Well, well, we shall see."&#xD;
*.     *      *       *. *          .*&#xD;
The evening arrived ; the Vestry met ; and, to Mr. .&#xD;
Elemmerton's surprise, it was called to consider Dr.&#xD;
Goodenough's resignation, and also to elect a successor.&#xD;
A member arose, and proposed the following resolu-&#xD;
tions:&#xD;
"Resolved, unanimously, by the Vestry of St.&#xD;
's Church, that we have received with pain and&#xD;
regret the resignation of our beloved Rector, the Rev.&#xD;
Dr. Goodenough ; and that we are the more grieved, if&#xD;
possible, at the cause which has led to the severance of&#xD;
a tie so near and dear to all the congregation whom we&#xD;
represent,-protracted ill health.&#xD;
"Resolved, That we record with pleasure the debt&#xD;
of gratitude due, by this congregation, to the Rev. Dr.&#xD;
Goodenough, for his faithful and efficient services for&#xD;
the past twenty years; and, in consideration of that&#xD;
&#xD;
debt of gratitude, and the affection entertained by this&#xD;
congregation for Dr. G., who, as a loving and venerable&#xD;
father, has worn himself out in the spiritual service of&#xD;
us his children in the Gospel, the Vestry hereby vote&#xD;
to him twenty-five hundred dollars per annum for the&#xD;
residue of his life; and after his death, should her life&#xD;
be spared beyond his, one thousand dollars per annum&#xD;
to his estimable wife, whom we cherish as a mother."&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton begged leave to object, very stren-&#xD;
uously, to that resolution. It was a great sum of money.&#xD;
In all his experience in the Church, he had never&#xD;
known such a thing to be done. lie thought, that ves-&#xD;
trymen were servants of the congregation ; and, for his&#xD;
part, he wished to be cautious about squandering the&#xD;
money of those whom he represented. lHe had a con-&#xD;
science in the matter, and expected to be held to an&#xD;
account for his deeds. He would vote for the first&#xD;
resolution, most cheerfully ; for, no member of that&#xD;
Vestry was more attached to Dr. G. than himself, nor&#xD;
had he any more ardent admirer. Nor did he doubt,&#xD;
that the congregation ought to be very charitable to&#xD;
Dr. G.; and, if left to themselves, they would be. Let&#xD;
them manifest their charities in a different way, each&#xD;
one giving what he or she pleases. These were his&#xD;
views. The money part of that resolution he could&#xD;
not vote for. . It was saddling the congregation with an&#xD;
enormous tax, that would require a considerable increase&#xD;
in pew-rents. He now paid a hundred dollars per&#xD;
annum for his pew; and, in all conscience, that was&#xD;
enough. And if Dr. G. was poor, it was his own fault.&#xD;
For twenty years he had enjoyed a large salary, and,&#xD;
with economy, by this time he ought to have been&#xD;

No one replied to Mr. B.'s speech. He stood alone&#xD;
in his glory ; but without vanquishing the foe. The&#xD;
President of the meeting put the vote. It was carried ;&#xD;
all voting in the affirmative except Mr. Blemmnerton !&#xD;
THE PREsIDENT.-" The next thing in order, gentle-&#xD;
men, is the election of a Rector to succeed the Rev. Dr.&#xD;
Goodenough." This he pronounced in 'a tremulous&#xD;
voice, as the big tear-drops stood in his eyes. "I have&#xD;
a gentleman to nominate, whose name and character&#xD;
have been placed before me by Dr. Goodenough. And&#xD;
here I trust we shall be entirely unanimous ; for, it is&#xD;
by no means certain, that we can procure the gentle-&#xD;
man I have in view, even if we give him a unanimous&#xD;
vote. He is ardently attached to the people among&#xD;
whon he has labored for ten years, and they are as de-&#xD;
votedly attached to him. And I feel as though we&#xD;
were about to offer to tear a father from his children. I&#xD;
therefore name the Rev. Mr. Lovegood, Rector of&#xD;
Church, Heartfulville. If any of you are unacquainted&#xD;
with his excellent reputation, I need only say, upon the&#xD;
authority of Dr. Good enough, that he is in every respect&#xD;
just the man for us. That is enough for me, gentlemen,&#xD;
and, I doubt not, quite enough for you."&#xD;
"It is not enough for ine," said Mr. Blemmerton,&#xD;
who, during the delivery of the brief remarks of the&#xD;
President, had been very restive. " It is not enough&#xD;
for me. Nor do I believe it will satisfy the congrega-&#xD;
tion. I am for pleasing the congregation. Mrs. Fas-&#xD;
tidious, Mrs. Nochurch, and Mrs. Fussy, all express-&#xD;

DOTTINGS BY THIE WAYSIDE.            'U&#xD;
ed to me their decided opinion, that the Vestry ought&#xD;
to call no clergyman to this important charge, until the&#xD;
congregation have had the privilege of hearing him&#xD;
preach, that they may judge of his style, voice, etc., and&#xD;
see what he looks like. This is my decided conviction.&#xD;
I won't vote for any man, till I have seen him, and&#xD;
heard him preach. And then, he hails from a very in-&#xD;
significant post ; and I do contend, that St.  's is&#xD;
entitled to a preacher of greater reputation. Our sala-&#xD;
ry will command the highest talent in the land. And&#xD;
I am iot for making any man's reputation. . I want a&#xD;
man who brings a reputation with him. Why, he is&#xD;
not even a D.ID.! You see, gentlemen, that I know&#xD;
something about Mr. Lovegood; and, from what I&#xD;
know, I should like to hear him preach, and I think it&#xD;
probable lie will preach here in a Sunday or two. But&#xD;
it is not clear, that I could vote for hime after hearing&#xD;
him, for I think he is strongly tainted with Puseyism ;&#xD;
yet that I would agree to waive, provided he pleased in&#xD;
every other respect, and so would Mrs. Fussy, Mrs. Fas-&#xD;
tidious, and Mrs. Nochurch, and the rest." Again&#xD;
there was no reply.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said the President, "the Rev. Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood is put in nomination for the Rectorship of&#xD;
this church. You who are in favor of that nomination&#xD;
will please say, Aye." All again in the affirmative,&#xD;
except Mr. Blemmerton.&#xD;

'T'E BLECMERToNS; oR1,&#xD;
&#xD;
elected Rector of the aforesaid church, to succeed the&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Goodenough, who has resigned on account of&#xD;
ill health ; and the undersigned was required to coin-&#xD;
municate the fact to you, and earnestly and affection-&#xD;
ately to urge you to accept the charge of our congrega-&#xD;
tion. In communicating the wishes of the Vestry, Rev.&#xD;
and dear Sir, it is my duty to inform you, that your&#xD;
election lacked one vote of being unanimous. But I&#xD;
beseech you not to permit that circumstance to deter&#xD;
you from accepting our call; for, were I at liberty to&#xD;
speak freely, I could satisfy you, that without that vote&#xD;
your choice will give the utmost satisfaction to all true&#xD;
friends of the church in the congregation, and your ac-&#xD;
ceptance will be hailed with joy.&#xD;
"I know that we are asking you to sever very dear&#xD;
ties ; and yet I trust soon to have the pleasure of com-&#xD;
municating your favorable decision to the Vestry and&#xD;
congregation. Rest assured, my dear Sir, that, in cast-&#xD;
ing your lot amongst us, you will find warm hearts and&#xD;
sincere friends, who will strive to be worthy of you, and&#xD;
to compensate, in some measure, for the severance of&#xD;
the ties that you will make in accepting our call.&#xD;
" Should you be disposed to visit us before coning to&#xD;
a determination, please make my house your home,&#xD;
No. --      street.&#xD;
" With great respect,&#xD;
" I am truly your friend and servant in Christ,&#xD;
" ,Tfarden."&#xD;
There are some persons in the world, who will not&#xD;
work right. They will be crooked, contrary, self-willed.&#xD;
If you desire them to go this way, they will persist in&#xD;
&#xD;
DOT"TINGs BY THE WAYSIDE.              79&#xD;
going that. It is useless to ply them with reason, or the&#xD;
gentle influence of persuasion ; this only makes then&#xD;
worse, more unmanageable. They will be stubborn,&#xD;
unruly, and defy all your efforts to mould them into any&#xD;
thing but what they are, and that is every thing per-&#xD;
verse and provoking. Tbore is but one word that ex-&#xD;
actly fits the character of such,-mulish. This word is&#xD;
exactly appropriate, and fills up every part of their&#xD;
character. Whoever is conversant with the whimsies&#xD;
of an old mule, or who has witnessed his stubborn an-&#xD;
tics, will be able to appreciate the application.&#xD;
Fancy yourself on a southern farm, on a hot summer's&#xD;
day, about noon. In yonder corn-field, in full view of&#xD;
the farm-house, you behold a negro boy at the handles&#xD;
of a plough, drawn by a mule. The rows of coin,,to&#xD;
which he is casting furrows, extend in a straight line to&#xD;
within a few rods of the manger. His muleship comes&#xD;
slowly along, in a patient, meditative mood.  The&#xD;
plough-boy has a dull, drowsy look ; and, to keep his&#xD;
eyes open, whistles a note which floats out on the still&#xD;
air. And so they go along, shutting out all sublunary&#xD;
things, and wrapt in their own philosophic meditations.&#xD;
In this way they have proceeded, half the length of the&#xD;
furrow, at the end of which they would be within a&#xD;
stone's throw of the manger and the ample dinner of&#xD;
his muleship. Presently, you see the cook take down&#xD;
from a shelf a long tin horn to call the hands to their&#xD;
dinner. "~ Toot ,-toot,--toot !" you hear the hour ring&#xD;
out.&#xD;
His muleship is done with philosophizing. He knows&#xD;
what that sound means, as well as any onme. lie pricks&#xD;
up his ears, and stops as suddenly as though a bullet&#xD;

had passed through his heart. "Go on, you Jack !"&#xD;
says the driver. But Jack moves not. " Go on, You&#xD;
sir !" and the driver gives him the line. But Jack puts&#xD;
his head down,-sets his fore-feet firmly out. Jack will&#xD;
not budge, another step. He must be relieved of his&#xD;
harness just there. Nothing else can be done. He will&#xD;
have his own way, right or wrong. It is useless to ar-&#xD;
guee with him. He will not hear it.&#xD;
One other illustration. Who has not heard of the&#xD;
Dutchman, who, being urged into a good work with&#xD;
arguments that he could not answer, after taxing his in&#xD;
genuity to the utmost extent, cut the whole argument&#xD;
short, with this significant and unanswerable reply, in&#xD;
his own peculiar dialect? "It's no use to talk with me.&#xD;
I'm a Dutchman, and you can't do any thin' with a&#xD;
Dutchman." The point was yielded, the case incura-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
And so, no amount of reasoning would have con-&#xD;
vinced Mr. Blemmerton, of the impropriety of his course.&#xD;
His eyes could see only in one direction. his horizon&#xD;
was bounded by self-will, right or wrong. There was&#xD;
to him but one world of thought, reason and opinion,-&#xD;
that in which he himself moved,-as the sole guiding&#xD;
and governing power. Therefore, after his display at&#xD;
the Vestry meeting, and his signal defeat, he returned&#xD;
to his home, more angered and chagrined, than mor-&#xD;
tified.&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton thought it preposterous. "Why,&#xD;
how could they act so! Didn't even reply to your&#xD;
speech, Mr. Blemmerton? It was certainly indicative of&#xD;
one fact,-that it was unanswerable. But it was posi-&#xD;
tivel y disrespectful. And voted a thousand dollars per&#xD;

Dr. G.! Well, I think they have feathered their nests,&#xD;
as old Aunt Sally Milkandwater would say. The other&#xD;
was bad enough ; but, really, that caps the climax.&#xD;
What will Mrs. Nochurch and Mrs. Fussy say to that? I&#xD;
wonder who would give me a thousand dollars per an-&#xD;
num in case I should be left a widow. And who's to&#xD;
pay it all? It's easy enough for them who have no-&#xD;
thing, to pass resolutions, but not quite so easy, I guess,&#xD;
to raise money. Ah! that's the rub ! When they&#xD;
haven't John Blemmerton's pocket to look to, I guess&#xD;
they'll find themselves in a pickle. No, not one cent,&#xD;
not one cent of it will go from this house ; that I'm fully&#xD;
resolved on. And I'll not notice another of them.&#xD;

were to have met at Mrs. Hopeful's; but I insisted on&#xD;
their meeting here, and it will look independent in me&#xD;
to decline it. I guess they'll be for pressing it; but&#xD;
remember, Dele, the law is passed. They can't meet&#xD;
here. I don't want them. We will not be made foot-&#xD;
balls of; and I guess we can get along, quite as well&#xD;
without them, as they can without us. And now we'll&#xD;
see who's the hardest. It is as much as I can do, to go&#xD;
to church again. Indeed, they'll have to make apolo-&#xD;

Mrs. Blemmerton sleep, if they can. They need it.&#xD;
Perhaps they will feel better in the morning. This is a&#xD;
world of sorrows and troubles ; but all things are shut&#xD;
out and forgotten, in dream-land. Sweet is the pillow&#xD;
of repose, to the throbbing temples and aching heart,&#xD;
when purity and innocence are our companions. "IKeep&#xD;
sound wisdon and discretion. Then shalt thou walk in&#xD;
thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. When&#xD;
thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid; yea, thou&#xD;
shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet." Prov. iii.&#xD;
21, 24. Holy type, unto the pure in heart, of their last&#xD;
sleep 1--" For so he giveth His beloved sleep," until the&#xD;
morning come when the dead bodies shall revive and be&#xD;
animated again with the living soul. "If we believe&#xD;
that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which&#xD;
sleep in Jesus will God bring with him." 1 Thess.&#xD;
iv. 14.&#xD;
Put ah, the carping of pride, the wincing soreness&#xD;
of ambition, the chafings of an evil heart,-these set&#xD;
thorns in the pillow, making it a rack of torture in the&#xD;
night-watches, bringing " fear" upon the wicked, and&#xD;
" trembling," which make all their " bones to shake."&#xD;
"Awake, thou that sleepest, and rise from the dead,&#xD;
and Christ shall give thee light." Eph. v. 14.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
MR. LOVEGOOD ; I1s HABITS AND HIS sANCTUM.&#xD;
Mn. LOVEGOOD had as yet never married. Why he&#xD;
had not, I cannot say. It certainly was not because he&#xD;
was too young. In his younger days, he had cherished&#xD;
a tender passion ; so, at least, I gathered, from a hint in&#xD;
the conclusion of an old manuscript which he once per-&#xD;
mitted me to read. " It is," said he, as he handed it to&#xD;
me " as faithful a transcript of a dream I once had, as&#xD;
my feeble pen could draw. It has been of service to&#xD;
me through the years that have intervened, and it may&#xD;
be of service to you."&#xD;
It was headed:&#xD;
"SINGULAR DREAM.&#xD;
I stood, methought, at the base of a vast and singu-&#xD;
larly beautiful mountain. As far up as the eye could&#xD;
reach, it was covered with "living green." On its&#xD;
pinnacle, I thought, stood* a vast temple, from whose&#xD;
windows there streamed forth.floods of light, which en-&#xD;
wrapped the whole mountain, and bathed it in beauty.&#xD;
From that great temple, inethought, all the wonders of&#xD;
vast creation opened to the view ; worlds upon worlds&#xD;
wheeling in their orbits, through the immensity of&#xD;
space. And thence issued strains of music, unknown to&#xD;
earth, which floated out on the air, and fell gently on&#xD;
my ears, as from the harpings of the heavenly hosts. I&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONs; ORI&#xD;
&#xD;
was striving at its base, to ascend that beautiful moin-&#xD;
tain,-but to no purpose. I could make no progress.&#xD;
But 0, how ardently my soul longed for the transcend-&#xD;
ent glories of that vast temple, its unearthly music, its&#xD;
enrapturing revelations !&#xD;
Presently, I turned in another direction ; and there,&#xD;
before me, planted firmly in the earth, stood a tall pole,&#xD;
like the mast of a ship, but not quite so large,-"smooth,&#xD;
glassy, and pointing towards the heavens, at an angle&#xD;
of about forty-five degrees. Something whispered to&#xD;
me, "that if I could ascend that pole, from its pinnacle&#xD;
I could plant my feet on the beautiful mountain."&#xD;
" But," said I, " it is too smooth,-I never can succeed;&#xD;
and then, it points not towards the mountain."  A&#xD;
whisper was heard again: "Try,-there is only an&#xD;
illusion; when you get to the top, you will perceive&#xD;
that all is well."  I made the attempt. I ascended&#xD;
rapidly, and with great facility. I had never thought&#xD;
it possible, that I could perform such a feat. As I went&#xD;
gayly up, I revolved the thought in my mind. I re-&#xD;
flected how I had often admired the facility with&#xD;
which seamen ,mounted the ropes and masts,-and was&#xD;
it possible that I had grown so expert? Away I went,&#xD;
up, up, from the earth.&#xD;
Suddenly my head grew dizzy, I cast my eyes to-&#xD;
wards the earth ; and oh, horrors ! I hung suspended&#xD;
high above a vast abyss, profound, dark, still as the&#xD;
shades of death. The solid earth had fled. And there&#xD;
I hung, upon that smooth, glassy pole, over eternity!&#xD;
Oh, the terror, the agony, of that moment ! Never&#xD;
shall it vanish from my memory. Whither had I&#xD;
gone,-whither in that fathomless profound, should Ibe&#xD;
&#xD;
84&#xD;
&#xD;
- oTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.          .5&#xD;
cast? Should I ever again behold the regions of light,&#xD;
or mingle with kindred spirits ? I essayed to cry&#xD;
aloud ; but speech was denied me. Nor was there an&#xD;
ear to hear ; for, could I have spoken, it would only&#xD;
have been to "the blackness of darkness," and my cry&#xD;
would have reverberated forever throughout that&#xD;
fathomless abyss.&#xD;
My limbs quivered, my head swam with the deliri-&#xD;
um of that awful inoment,-my hold relaxed ; I must&#xD;
launch out on that dark, illimitable ocean ! " 0 Father&#xD;
of mercies and God of all comfort !" I cried, "have&#xD;
mercy on me! Saviour of the world, save me !" In a&#xD;
moment, consciousness is gone,-all is over ! Oh! field&#xD;
of' darkness ! world without light and without bounds,&#xD;
whither shall I fly, whither be cast? In a moment,&#xD;
that dread ordeal is past,-how, I know not. But&#xD;
lo! I stand again on the solid earth, and there, be-&#xD;
fore me, is that dreaded, awful pole. Again, the same&#xD;
voice whispers : " Try again, it requires courage. You&#xD;
can ascend." " No, never, never !" I exclaimed, with&#xD;
faltering tongue and shuddering heart. "Never shall&#xD;
I again pass that lifetime of agony. My soul stands in&#xD;
awe of that terror." The voice ceasbLd. I turned away.&#xD;
Once more I stood at the base of the beautiful moun-&#xD;
tain;--once more I essayed to make its ascent. Now I&#xD;
am some rods up. I look aloft, the way seems easy ; the&#xD;
same glorious light plays over the whole mountain, the&#xD;
same heavenly strains float around me ; yet, with all my&#xD;
agonizing struggles, I make but little progress. I pant,&#xD;
and grow weary, and pause, almost in despair; but&#xD;
still longing for the glories above, that beckon me on,&#xD;
as so many "signals hung out from on high." And&#xD;

&#xD;
then I hear another voice,-0, how sweet, how gentle,&#xD;
how heavenly !-" FAITH, FAITH !" it said. That word&#xD;
yet rings in my ears, and thrills my heart. " Why toil&#xD;
on here so slowly, now ascending, now receding? Faith,&#xD;
faith will lift thee to that glorious tower. ' Stand, there-&#xD;
fore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having&#xD;
on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod&#xD;
with the preparation of the Gospel of peace ; above all,&#xD;
taking the shield of Faith,' Eph. vi. 14, etc., so shalt&#xD;
thou climb that towering mountain ; and there are an-&#xD;
gels going up and clown from the throne of.God, to&#xD;
guide and guard thee. Go on, struggling mortal. Faith&#xD;
will bear thee upwards." And on I went, new beauties&#xD;
at every step opening upon my enravished eyes,-"my&#xD;
soul breaking out for the very fervent desire that it had"&#xD;
to the delights of that glorious temple towards which I&#xD;
was pressing. -    . . . . I awoke. The vision&#xD;
was gone !*&#xD;
But there was left to me the treasure of a heavenly&#xD;
lesson. The first voice was that of the Tempter, who&#xD;
promises liberally, but deceives unto eternal death.&#xD;
For that smooth, glassy pole, which appears to me now&#xD;
so singular, I could never find a fitting analogy, unless&#xD;
its smoothness, and the ease with which I ascended it,&#xD;
and the great difficulty of clinging to it when once I&#xD;
grew dizzy, typified the way of sin, which leads to the&#xD;
abodes of woe, and the slender tenure on eternal lifc&#xD;
that they have, whose feet stand not fast on the beauti-&#xD;
ful mountain, and are not "shod with the prepara-&#xD;
tion of the Gospel of peace."  But ah! that dread&#xD;
, This is no further imagination, than an actual dream is imagina-&#xD;
tion-.&#xD;
&#xD;
86&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
abyss,-there is no mistaking that,-it was that world&#xD;
of darkness, where the light of God's countenance&#xD;
cometh not.&#xD;
The beautiful mountain, I think, was the Church mili-&#xD;
tant ; and it, and the temple which crowned it above,&#xD;
typified the Church militant and triumphant,-the&#xD;
Christian's pathway to eternal glory, and the beatific&#xD;
visions and glories of that house not made with hands,&#xD;
eternal in the heavens. 0 my soul, shout for joy,&#xD;
break forth into singing, that thou art redeemed,-that&#xD;
thy feet stand upon that glorious mountain, "which fill-&#xD;
eth the earth," and reacheth even unto that living&#xD;
Temple, where the "King" eternal "reigns in His beau-&#xD;
ty," and the angels harp their heavenly notes, and re-&#xD;
deemed men shall make glad the city of our God.&#xD;
Faith lifts my soul to God. Faith assures me, that I&#xD;
may climb that beautiful mountain, and at last behold&#xD;
that glorious Temple, enter its courts, and dwell forever&#xD;
in the presence and joy of Him who is the light and&#xD;
glory thereof. Faith assures me, that there, in that&#xD;
land of blessedness, purity, and love, I shall join&#xD;
the loved and the lost, where naught will enter to&#xD;
blight the felicity that shall be sanctified, heavenly,&#xD;
beatific.&#xD;
Ah! loved one, I see thee now, as I saw thee in thy&#xD;
flush of life and prime of beauty! "The Lord gave,&#xD;
and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name&#xD;
of the Lord."&#xD;
So the manuscript ended. I almost regretted read-&#xD;
ing the concluding sentence, for I thought that the au-&#xD;
thor was perhaps unconscious of its being there, and&#xD;

THE BLEMMERToNs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
had unwittingly revealed to me a heart-secret of his&#xD;
younger days, into which I would upon no account have&#xD;
irreverently gazed. " The heart knoweth his own bit-&#xD;
terness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his&#xD;
joy. "-Prov. xiv. 10. I returned to him the manu-&#xD;
script, without comment or question.&#xD;
"Jonathan," said he, "it is a true picture. I penned&#xD;
it the next morning. But oh ! words are inadequate&#xD;
to describe what I passed through, either of the agonies&#xD;
or of the joys of that dream. Would that I could find&#xD;
language in which to depict the contrasts in my feel-&#xD;
ings, as I hung suspended over that awful eternity ; and&#xD;
then, in the next moment, as I listened to those enrap-&#xD;
turing strains, lived in the heavenly light, and joyfully&#xD;
mounted up on high to that beautiful temple ! But, let&#xD;
it pass. Without doubt,-I say it of hope, I say it of&#xD;
Faith alone, after the manner of him who once ex-&#xD;
claimed : 'For I am persuaded that neither death, nor&#xD;
life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things&#xD;
present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor&#xD;
any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the&#xD;
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' Rom.&#xD;
viii. 38, etc. Without doubt, after I shall have passed&#xD;
through the valley of the shadow of death, leaning on&#xD;
the 'staff,' and protected by the 'rod' of Immanuel, I&#xD;
shall stand upon the beautiful mountain beyond, behold&#xD;
that glorious vision in reality,-' see the King in His&#xD;
beauty,' in 'the land that is very far off,' and be forever&#xD;
satisfied, when I awake with His likeness,' in His&#xD;
presence and glory."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was now in his fortieth year; and,&#xD;
th ough of a very sprightly, elastic disposition, fond of&#xD;

DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
young company, and all that constitutes the charm  of&#xD;
social intercourse,--its amenities, suavities, and innocent&#xD;
jocoseness,-yet was there, at times, a touch of melan-&#xD;
choly pervading his carriage and manners. But this&#xD;
was like the last softening touch of the artist to the&#xD;
painting,-it embalmed, as it were, his whole character,&#xD;
and rendered him altogether lovely and attractive.&#xD;
lIe boards with a cherished parishioner in Heartful-&#xD;
ville ; but, in a quiet part of the village he has his&#xD;
sanctum, a lovely, poetic, sanctified home, where at&#xD;
almost all hours of the day you may find him engaged,&#xD;
either in reading or writing. If lie is out on parochial&#xD;
duty, you will find a slate hanging at his door, telling&#xD;
you where he may be found, if your business is urgent,&#xD;
or when he will be at the study. If you tarry, you&#xD;
will be sure to see him at the appointed hour, walking,&#xD;
cane in hand, slowly down the street. If he sees you&#xD;
waiting in the distance, lie takes out his watch, inspects&#xD;
it, and, if the hour has arrived, quickens his pace;&#xD;
if not, he pursues the even tenor of his way,-seem-&#xD;
ing to say, " There is no hurry ; I am as good as my&#xD;
wcord."&#xD;
You would like to take a view of that enchanting&#xD;
spot,-his study. We'll walk round. This way, if you&#xD;

and his habits. He has gone upon the hill yonder, to&#xD;
see old blind Judy, a free colored woman, who is one&#xD;
of his alms-pensioners. This is his day to visit her, and&#xD;
contribute of his alms to her necessities. With old&#xD;
Judy he spends an hour. It is, he says, one of his most&#xD;
delightful and sanctified duties : during that hour, they&#xD;
talk about the olden time, when her good old master&#xD;

and grandchildren; they extol his virtues, and together&#xD;
mingle their tears to his memory,-the seeing and the&#xD;
sightless ! From this, their conversation would neces-&#xD;
sarily run out upon religion and the Church, two things&#xD;
inseparable in their estimation; and the day when "the&#xD;
silver cord" would "be loosed," and they would "g(o&#xD;

streets ;" and that last great day, when "living saints&#xD;
and dead" shall stand in the " circle of the redeemed,"&#xD;

woman ! Thou shalt receive thy crown, and the blessed&#xD;
commendation, "Well done, good and faithful servant,&#xD;
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."  And thou, sight-,&#xD;

It is a pleasant, balmy day in summer. The full-&#xD;
leaved elms, which adorn the streets of the village,&#xD;
protect us from the rays of the sun, and impart a re-&#xD;
freshing coolness to the atmosphere. There, tread&#xD;
lightly now, if you please, for, somehow, I feel, when I&#xD;
approach this place, as though I stood on holy ground.&#xD;
Every thing here is sanctified,-the trees, the birds, the&#xD;
flowers, all are holy. We pause at the wicker-gate,&#xD;
which opens on the gravel pathway that leads to the&#xD;
door of the sanctum,-that, in its meek beauty, retires&#xD;
some rods from the street, and stands in the centre of a&#xD;
plot about fifty yards square, which is inclosed by a&#xD;
plain, neat plank fence, recently whitewashed, and&#xD;
which looks as pure as the driven snow.&#xD;
A row of forest elms and maples, each standing as a&#xD;
sentinel in its place, closes the external view. A&#xD;

fall in varying festoons to the ground. Embowered in&#xD;
the branches of this rose, you will discover several&#xD;
little houses, the work of Mr. L.'s hands, for the wrens;&#xD;
and you will see the parent birds, darting about, chat-&#xD;
tering away, full of glee, as they fulfil the pleasant&#xD;
duty of feeding their young. And the little humming-&#xD;
birds will be playing at hide-and-seek with the honey-&#xD;
suckles. They'll dart up, take a kiss here and there,&#xD;
and in a moment they are off,-away, away,-hum,&#xD;
hum,-buzz, buzz,-they are gone, to dip their bills into&#xD;
the cup of some other flower, and suck its ambrosia.&#xD;
A row, on either side, of neatly-trimmed box, binds&#xD;
the gravel walk, while, right and left, over the whole&#xD;
plot,--a smoothly mown lawn,-roses of a hundred&#xD;
choice varieties, as if of Nature's planting, are inter-&#xD;
spersed ;-and the sweet jessamine, the gorgeous dahlia,&#xD;

From the top of yonder eln, a mocking-bird, as free&#xD;
as the air he breathes, trills his notes,-now plaintive,&#xD;
now sharp, now a bass, now a tenor,-imitating the&#xD;
feathered tribe, amusing himself over their foibles or&#xD;
their beauties, in the singing art, in shaips and flats, or&#xD;
quavers and semiquavers. A funny little fellow is he.&#xD;
He is a confirmed mocker,-mocks every thing, and&#xD;

The birds seem to be aware of this ; therefore they&#xD;

peace, and love ! Here may the soul hold sweet coin-&#xD;

the wings of faith to those bright regions, where are&#xD;
forever heard the harpings of heavenly ninistrels. Eden,&#xD;
the blessed abode of our first parents ere they sinned,&#xD;
was a garden, and all such spots seem to be types of in-&#xD;
nocence and beauty. The thorn and the thistle sprang&#xD;
up, indeed, after the fall; but still the Lord permitted&#xD;
the flowers to remain and bloom, types, as it were, of&#xD;
Eden regained, and its perennial joys. Eden was a&#xD;
garden interspersed with the choicest flowers and shrub-&#xD;
bery, that made glad the heart ; and there, methinks,&#xD;
" From rise of morn till set of sun,"&#xD;
the sweetest of the feathered songsters poured forth&#xD;
their notes of praise to their Creator.&#xD;
" Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose,"&#xD;

It is five o'clock. Here comes Mr. Lovegood. A&#xD;
cordial shake of the hand, a soul-stirring "God bless&#xD;
you," which thrills through your heart, makes you feel&#xD;
at home. The key turns in the door, you enter; it is&#xD;
the study of a bachelor; not over-neat; for there is&#xD;
some confusion of books and papers about the desk,-.&#xD;
but this Mr. Lovegood, somehow, cannot avoid ; it&#xD;
seems to be natural to him,-about such matters, he&#xD;
is not a " pink of perfection." But he understands&#xD;
every thing, just as it is. Were you to remove or alter&#xD;
the position of a book or paper, it would disarrange all&#xD;
his plans, perhaps all his thoughts ; for they are wrap-&#xD;
ped up in those scattered leaves of manuscript, just as&#xD;
they lie. You need not be uneasy, his sermon will&#xD;
come out all right ; and in time, on Sunday morning;&#xD;
and you will learn something from it.&#xD;
His library is well stored with works on theology,&#xD;
history, law, medicine, science, the classics, and choice&#xD;
literature : indeed, there is something on every subject&#xD;
of general utility to man. The books are carefully as-&#xD;
sorted, numbered, and placed in order on the shelves&#xD;
round the room. The floor is covered with matting,-&#xD;
there are half a dozen cane-bottom chairs, scattered&#xD;
promiscuously about the room ; two old-fashioned, wal-&#xD;
nut arm-chairs, with time-worn cushions ; a coat and&#xD;
hat rack, cane and umbrella stand, keep guard at the&#xD;
door. A study-gown of oil-chintz hangs from a rack&#xD;
on the wall; and, here and there, all round the room,&#xD;
are hung some choice -old paintings, and portraits of de-&#xD;
ceased Bishops, and other cherished clergymen. A&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
A CURT LETTER;  A FoX-fHUNT; FOXISH PEOPLE; AS&#xD;
CUNNTNG AS A FOX.&#xD;
WE are scarcely seated in Mr. Lovegood's study,&#xD;
when a little colored boy comes up the gravel walk.&#xD;
He pauses at the door, standing, hat in hand, on one&#xD;
side, and leering in round the casement of the door.&#xD;
Come in, Jim."&#xD;
Jim was the grandchild of old Aunt Judy, was a sort&#xD;
of pet with Mr. Lovegood, and now filled to him the&#xD;
important and dignified post of "right-hand-man;"&#xD;
blackened his boots, brought him water, and watched&#xD;
the mails. This last office Jim especially delighted in.&#xD;
It had a biggish look about it ; and it was really&#xD;
amusing to see him swagger about the door of the post-&#xD;
office, arms a-kimbo, and putting on all the airs that so&#xD;
dignified a position required and warranted !&#xD;
" Come in, Jim. What news have you to-day ?"&#xD;
Jim came up smiling, and handed him a letter. It&#xD;
proved to be the aforesaid epistle of Mr. Blemmerton.&#xD;
"John Blemmerton !" ejaculated he,-" John Blem-&#xD;
merton ! -St. -'s Church, --. Well, that is soon&#xD;
answered." So, turning to his desk, he wrote the fol-&#xD;
lowing reply:&#xD;
"HIEARTFULVILLE, NOV. -, 18-.-&#xD;
"My dear Sir :--I have to acknowledge the receipt&#xD;
of your kind favor. Entertaining the views, on the&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             97&#xD;
subject-matter of your letter, that I do, and which an&#xD;
experience of eighteen years has confirmed me in, I&#xD;
beg, most respectfully, to decline a compliance with&#xD;
your request.&#xD;
"IYours very faithfully, etc.&#xD;
" JOHN BLEMMERTON, Esq."&#xD;
"There, Jim, you are a smart boy,-negatively smart,&#xD;
that is; run with that letter to the office, mail it, and&#xD;
then go home to Grandmamma Judy. I shall not want&#xD;
you again to-night." And away went Jim, whistling,&#xD;
down the gravel walk.&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton will soon know that, whether ho&#xD;
understands human nature better than Mr. Heartful or&#xD;
not, Mr. Lovegood will not gratify him with a display&#xD;
of his powers in a trial sermon.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood calls after Jim, as he passes out at the&#xD;
gate :-" Mind, Jim, that the horns and the hounds do&#xD;
not keep you away so late again in the morning !"&#xD;
And then turning to us, he explains that there was a&#xD;
fox-hunt yesterday morning, in which some gentlemen&#xD;
of the village took part; and, as they rode out in the&#xD;
morning, Jim followed them so far down the road, that&#xD;
he did not get back until late in the day. Our friend&#xD;
from the city is very much interested,-his curiosity is&#xD;
at once excited. "Do tell me something about a fox-&#xD;
"Well, when I was a boy, like all other boys, I was&#xD;
fond of fun. But I was not given to cruelty. And yet&#xD;
I was exceedingly fond of the fox-chase, which would&#xD;
indeed have been cruel, had there not been an induce-&#xD;
mient, more rational and proper than the mere pleasur-&#xD;

&#xD;
able excitement attending it. We must reflect, then,&#xD;
that foxes are very destructive to poultry and young&#xD;
stock; especially are they prone to prowl about at&#xD;
night, stealing and killing lambs and pigs. In my&#xD;
father's neighborhood, they had a custom of hunting&#xD;
the fox; and this, not simply for sport,-and yet I must&#xD;
acknowledge, that to us boys it was a great treat in&#xD;
that line,-but to rid the neighborhood of a dangerous&#xD;
foe. The moment a lamb or pig was stolen, the alarm&#xD;
was given to all the neighboring gentry. A fox is&#xD;
about; and there must be no rest till he is ferreted out.&#xD;
A party is arranged ; and, early on the following&#xD;
morning, while the dew scents the air, or the frost&#xD;
glitters in the rays of the rising sun, you hear the blast&#xD;
of the huntsman's horn,-the hounds howl and bark.&#xD;
And here we go, each from his home, mounted on a&#xD;
swift steed, eager for the chase,-for he understands&#xD;
what is going on, as well as the rider or the clogs, and&#xD;
takes as much delight in it. The hounds run helter-&#xD;
skelter to the horn, and the riders follow on.&#xD;
"When all have arrived at the place of rendezvous,&#xD;
by appointment, the hounds, a full pack, and well&#xD;
trained, are sent out into the thickets and forests. They&#xD;
scatter about, hither and thither, scenting the air,-&#xD;
and so away we go, scouring through the forests,&#xD;
mounting fences, leaping ditches, in full glee, encour-&#xD;
aging the hounds !-Presently, away off in the distance,.&#xD;
you hear an opening note. ' Hark-hark !'-says the&#xD;
huntsman; and riders and hounds all dash off in the&#xD;
direction of that opening note. ' Blixen has struck the&#xD;
scent,-has roused old Reynard from his den, or hiding-&#xD;
place. All the hounds gather around; and each, as&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              99&#xD;
he catches the scent, gives out his answering note.&#xD;
Old 'Blazer' is the leader. Hurra for Blazer! Go on,&#xD;
Blazer! 'Bow-ow!' he says; and, with his head set&#xD;
out, away he dashes. The pack fall in behind in a&#xD;
row; and then commences the music. Ever and anon&#xD;
you hear old 'Blazer's' bow-ow,-he drawls it out, and&#xD;
it rings over the hills, far away,--and then they are in&#xD;
full chase and full cry, high notes and low, tenor and&#xD;
bass. All seem to fall into time ; and the welkin rings&#xD;
with hound- music! And so away they dash. The&#xD;
steeds prick their ears ; and away we press,-now&#xD;
whooping,-now cheering. The riders, perchance,&#xD;
separate and scatter, here and there, to get the best&#xD;
opportunity to witness the chase, or rise to thwart old&#xD;
Reynard in his wily tricks.&#xD;
" We will spur up to the top of yonder hill; there&#xD;
we shall have a view, for miles around. Hark! see !&#xD;
there goes Reynard, stretching across yon open field.&#xD;
'Bow-ow !' says old Blazer, some mile or two behind,&#xD;
but coming on the track; and he is answered by the&#xD;
full pack,-' Bow-ow, Bow-ow !'.-and the notes run up&#xD;
and down, and zig-zag, but all seeming to fall into the&#xD;
right key and the right time. You have heard the&#xD;
saying, 'As cunning as a fox?' It is one of our pro-&#xD;
verbialisms. Now watch! Reynard deliberately squats&#xD;
on his haunches,-pricks up his ears,--turns his head,-&#xD;
looks back,-listens attentively. You had supposed&#xD;
that he was about to clear the open field, for the next&#xD;
forest. Not so. He turns short on his heel, makes&#xD;
a right angle, and comes back to the same forest!&#xD;
"Now you say, ' Call Blazer, and put him right after&#xD;
him.' No, no ; Blazer knows what to do, better than&#xD;

you.  Watch on. Here he comes, dashing on over&#xD;
the field. 'Bow-ow ;' another and another behind him&#xD;
answer, 'BoW-ow.' Reynard is now out of sight, and&#xD;
down far into the next valley. Blazer dashes on. 'Ahi!,&#xD;
you exclaim, 'lhe has passed the point where Reynard&#xD;
paused and turned ! Never mind ; watch Blazer ; his&#xD;
head is erect, snuffing the air. He has lost the trail.&#xD;
Here is a trouble. Reynard is going for his life, we&#xD;
know not whither.&#xD;
" Blazer whirls about, takes a compass, runs a circle,&#xD;
and presently 'Bow-ow,' he says; away he goes, and&#xD;
there is a fresh outcry from the whole pack.&#xD;
" 'Now,' you say, 'dash on, follow on ; let's keep&#xD;
up with them !' No, we will remain here, and see&#xD;
more of the chase. 'But Reynard,' you say, 'has made&#xD;
a clean track.  He will not come this way again.'&#xD;
We will wait. The 'Bow-ow, dies off, away in the dis-&#xD;
tance.  'They are miles off,' you say. Very well, we&#xD;
shall see the chase. Presently you hear a fresh outcry.&#xD;
Reynard has been at his old trick of doubling again.&#xD;
Be patient,-listen ! There is a rustling, as of a light&#xD;
foot in the leaves, away above you. There he goes;&#xD;
and he dashes right on, to the same track that he passed&#xD;
over at first. But, instead of running in the same di-&#xD;
rection, he dashes on in the opposite, and runs back&#xD;
on his old' track.  Again he is out of sight.  You&#xD;
grow very impatient. But here come the pack. You&#xD;
hear them ring out, ever and anon, away down the&#xD;
forest. The notes are nearer and nearer.&#xD;
"'They dash out of the forest, on Reynard's track.&#xD;
Dash on,-dash on! Hold, there is a break! Which&#xD;
way now? 'Can't you direct them?'-No;go on,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              101&#xD;
Blazer.  Hark !-Dash   on,-heigh-ho!   And away&#xD;
Blazer goes on the back-track, and Blixen in the former&#xD;
direction, each followed by a posse. Watch on, they'll&#xD;
soon let you know (if you do not already) which way&#xD;
Reynard has gone. They are both silent, both intent&#xD;
on their task, giving out an occasional half-note. Pres-&#xD;
ently you hear the exultant announcement from Blazer,&#xD;
-' Bow-ow ! bow-ow !' lie is satisfied that lie has it.&#xD;
Reynard is at a trick again. Blixen, with his posse,&#xD;
hurries back; and they bring up the rear, and away&#xD;
they go again.  And Reynarcl dodges and quibbles in&#xD;
this way, sometimes a whole day before he is taken.&#xD;
Sometimes, he eludes all attempts, and escapes; some-&#xD;
times, instead of forming an angle, he will run round a&#xD;
hill in a circle, and run back on his old track. Some-&#xD;
times, he will mount a fence, scramble along it a while,&#xD;
and then spring off as far as he can. Sometimes, he&#xD;
will run into a den, immediately run out, retrace his&#xD;
steps a little way, and. -then bolt off in another direction.&#xD;
Any manomvre to gain time, and puzzle the hounds.&#xD;
But, an expert, well-trained leader in a pack, under-&#xD;
stands Reynard's cunning, and soon ferrets out his&#xD;
movements.&#xD;
" ' As cunning as a fox,' is a very expressive saying.&#xD;
As used among us, it has the signification of low cun-&#xD;
ninfg, trickiness, underhand dealing; and is generally&#xD;
used in a bad sense. And you see its prototype in the&#xD;
luibblings, pietences, and wiles of Reynard, whose&#xD;
every effort is to take an advantage. But, in his case,&#xD;
we opine that this is not dishonorable, nor to his dis-&#xD;
credit,-but a stroke of sound wisdom and good policy.&#xD;
Indeed, I highly applaud him as a wise master ; for he&#xD;

&#xD;
is managing and manoeuvring for his life. But it is&#xD;
widely different in its application to men, who are said&#xD;
to be 'as cunning as a fox;' for, in that case, it bears&#xD;
the sense of secret, crafty cunningness and shrewdness,&#xD;
by which a dishonorable, unlawful advantage is taken&#xD;
of another."&#xD;
"Hence," continued Mr. Lovegood, "we learn a les-&#xD;
son, from all this, simple, childlike as it may appear.&#xD;
From the simplest things in nature, the commonplaces&#xD;
of life, the wild beasts of the forest, may man learn&#xD;
wisdom. Our Lord in His teachings turned all these&#xD;
to account. He commanded His Apostles to be 'wise&#xD;
as serpents, and harmless as doves,' Matt. x.16 ; where-&#xD;
in He sets forth the serpent as an emblem of prudence,&#xD;
and the dove of harmlessness. The Apostles were sent&#xD;
forth 'as sheep in the midst of wolves,' in an employ-&#xD;
ment full of peril. They were, therefore, cautioned Th&#xD;
be as wary as the serpent, in preserving themselves&#xD;
from danger; and as harmless as the dove, in giving&#xD;
offence.&#xD;
"'Now, if the simplicity of doves,' says St. Augus-&#xD;
tine, ' be enjoined on us, what hath the wisdom of the&#xD;
serpent to do in the simplicity of the dove? This in&#xD;
the dove I love, that she has no gall; this I fear in the&#xD;
serpent, that he has poison. But now do not fear the&#xD;
serpent altogether. Something he has for thee to hate,&#xD;
and something for thee to imitate; for, when the ser-&#xD;
pent is weighed down with age, and he feels the burden&#xD;
of his many years, he contracts and forces himself into&#xD;
a hole, and lays aside his old coat of skin, that he may&#xD;
spring forth into new life.&#xD;
" 'Imitate him in this, thou Christian, who dost hear&#xD;
&#xD;
Christ saying: Enter ye in at the strait gate. And&#xD;
the Apostle Paul saith to thee : Put ye of the old man,&#xD;
with his deeds, and put ye on the new man. Thou&#xD;
hast, then, something to imitate in the serp~ent. . ....&#xD;
Imitate him in this again : Keep thy head safe. Keep&#xD;
Christ with thee. Have not some of you, it may be,&#xD;
observed, on occasions when you have wished to kill an&#xD;
adder, that, to save his head, he will expose his whole&#xD;
body to the strokes of his assailant? He would not,&#xD;
that that part of him should be struck where he knows&#xD;
that his life resides. And our life is Christ ; for, he&#xD;
hatli Himself said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the&#xD;
Life. Hear the Apostle also : 2he Head of the man&#xD;
is christ. Whoso, then, keepeth Christ in him, keep-&#xD;
eth his head for his protection.&#xD;
"'Now, what need is there to commend to you, in&#xD;
many words, the simplicity of the dove? The serpent's&#xD;
poison must be guarded against: then, there was a danger&#xD;
in imitation ; then, there was something to be feared;&#xD;
but the dove you may imitate securely. Mark how the&#xD;
doves rejoice in society. Everywhere do they fly and&#xD;
feed together; they do not like to be alone. They de-&#xD;
light in communion ; they preserve affection ; their&#xD;
comings are the plaintive cries of love. Yea, even when&#xD;
doves, as we have often noticed, dispute about their holes,&#xD;
it is as it were but a peaceful strife. Do they separate,&#xD;
because of their contentions ? Nay, still do they fly&#xD;
and feed together; and their very strife is peaceful.&#xD;
See this strife of doves, in what the Apostle saith,&#xD;
2 Thess. iii. 14,-If a'ny man obey not our word by&#xD;
this Epistle, marks that man, and have no company&#xD;
with him. Behold the strife! but o serve, now, how&#xD;

it is the strife of cloves, not of wolves. He subjoined&#xD;
immediately, Yet count him not as an enemy, but ad-&#xD;
monish him as a brother. The dove loves, even when&#xD;
she is in strife; and the wolf, even when he caresses,&#xD;
hates; therefore, having the simplicity of doves, and&#xD;
the wisdom   of serpents, sing lands to God. le it&#xD;

" And the fox our Lord has set forth, as an emblem of&#xD;
treachery and double-dealing.   'Go and tell that fox,&#xD;
(Herod,) Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to-&#xD;
day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be per-&#xD;
fected,' Luke xiii. 32. To impose this ignominious, but&#xD;
appropriate name on Herod, is not contrary to the com-&#xD;
mand, 'not to speak evil of the ruler of thy people ;' it&#xD;
being the office of the prophet, not to spare kings,&#xD;
when they reprove their offences, Jer. i. 10. Our Lord,&#xD;
therefore, here uses his prophetical power, in giving&#xD;
this tyrant a name suitable to his actions.t And you&#xD;
have only to ponder the history of the man, as you&#xD;
will find it portrayed by Josephus and Tacitus, to dis-&#xD;
cover the aptness of the title appropriated to him by&#xD;
our Lord.&#xD;
" He was 'a cruel and despotic man,' full of all sub-&#xD;
tlety and guile; one 'who had waded through blood to the&#xD;
seat of power' that he filled. And I know of no point&#xD;
from which to view his character, and continue my&#xD;
moral, so appropriate as that afforded by Scripture,&#xD;
St. Augustine, Homn. 14.  .t Whitby.&#xD;
I have blended the character of two Herods into one ; for, there&#xD;
is no great difference between them. He of St. Matthew, ii. 3, is&#xD;
Herod the Great; while he of St. Luke, xiii. 82, is Herod Antipas.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             105&#xD;
when the wise men brought to Jerusalem the news of&#xD;
the Saviour's birth. ' When Herod the king had heard&#xD;
these things, he was troubled.' Matt. ii. 3. The fox&#xD;
feared for his safety, and began to cast about for&#xD;
means to avoid. a catastrophe! Did he quake and&#xD;
tremble at the thought, that his sins would find him&#xD;
out? Ah, no : he was filled with terror; not that he&#xD;
had sinned ; not that his conscience, black and guilty&#xD;
as it was, had smitten him with grief and shame ; not&#xD;
that be feared the terrors of a judgment to come ; but&#xD;
he trembled and was filed with trouble because a&#xD;
KING was born. He looked to his crown ; for this he&#xD;
feared. 'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?'&#xD;
rang in his ears, as the death-knell of his departing&#xD;
power. He felt already (or fancied that he did) his&#xD;
throne tottering under him. Fear seized upon his cow-&#xD;
ard' heart ; he felt as though there was no time to be&#xD;
lost, and that at all hazards he must maintain his seat of&#xD;
honor and power. And now behold how sin begets sin.&#xD;
Like Pharaoh, he was wholly given up to his base lusts&#xD;
and passions. He had reached the height of power,&#xD;
through intrigue and blood ; and, by the same means,&#xD;
he determined to maintain it.&#xD;
" And now craft, subtlety, and deceit are brought into&#xD;
full exercise, to enable him to accomplish his unholy pur-&#xD;
poses.. He cares only for himself; he has certain aims and&#xD;
ends to accomplish. His own base heart urged him on&#xD;
to baser deeds; and the blood of the Holy Innocents&#xD;
flows, to fill the measure of his iniquity! His ruling&#xD;
sin was a lust of power. That passion chafed and goad-&#xD;
ed his heart, until it produced a brood of sins of an-&#xD;
other character. Flattery, deception, and cruelty, had&#xD;

106     THE BLEMMERToNS; oR,&#xD;
&#xD;
marked his steps ; and woe and misery followed in his&#xD;
wake. Now we find him filled with false apprehen-&#xD;
sions, and groundless fears. Out of these grew bitter&#xD;
jealousies and animosities. He had, in short, become a&#xD;
prey to the basest and most tormenting passions. The&#xD;
bare mention, that a ' king is born' filled him with ire ;&#xD;
and, without pausing to. inquire into the nature of the&#xD;
Kingdom that Christ would establish, he 'was troubled,'&#xD;
lest he should be forced to surrender his usurped power to&#xD;
other hands. And this led to a still baser jealousy of,&#xD;
and animosity against, the unknown child whom the&#xD;
wise men sought, and urged him on to the effort&#xD;
that he made to destroy 'The Babe of Bethlehem.'&#xD;
Little knew he of the kingdom that the Messiah&#xD;
would establish. Had he paused awhile, he might&#xD;
have learned, that his fears were groundless, and have&#xD;
been kept from that great crime which filled all Beth-&#xD;
lehem and the region round with lamentation.*&#xD;
" Herod, doubtless, had laid some secret plot for our&#xD;
Lord's destruction. Hence the warning of some of the&#xD;
Pharisees, 'Get thee out, and depart hence, for Herod&#xD;
will kill thee.' They knew his disposition; that, like&#xD;
the cunning fox, he was full of stealth and intrigue.&#xD;
Hence our Lord appropriates to him the title, 'That&#xD;
fox.'&#xD;
"The prophet Ezekiel compares the false, treacher-&#xD;
ous prophets of Israel to foxes. ' 0 Israel, thy proph-&#xD;
ets are like the foxes in the deserts.' Ezek. xiii. 4.-&#xD;
'Deceitful workers,' 2 Cor. xi. 13, as the Apostle styles&#xD;
* The author's article, entitled "Epiphany," in the February No.&#xD;
of the Evergreen, 1849.&#xD;

such persons, who craftily insinuate false doctrines into&#xD;
weak and unstable minds ; and withal hungry and&#xD;
ravenous, and such as catch greedily at any appearance&#xD;
of advantage. ' There is a conspiracy of her prophets&#xD;
in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the&#xD;
prey; they have devoured souls ; they have taken the&#xD;
treasure and precious things; they have made her&#xD;
many widows in the midst thereof.' Ezek. xxii. 25.&#xD;
And Solomon, Song ii. 15, has these words : ' Take us&#xD;
the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines : for our&#xD;
vines have tender grapes.'&#xD;
"And since, as we have seen, the prophet Ezekiel&#xD;
compares false prophets to foxes, may it not be that the&#xD;
wise man, in his song of loves, in the words just quoted,&#xD;
alludes to false teachers in his Spouse the Church? It&#xD;
is so understood by the connnentators. False teachers&#xD;
appeared very early in the Church, and are therefore&#xD;
compared to young foxes, in regard to their known&#xD;
craft and subtlety, windings and turnings, shiftings and&#xD;
evasions, whereby the more simple sort especially, and&#xD;
such as were newly converted, (compared here to ten-&#xD;
der grapes, as the Church itself is to a vine,) were in dan-&#xD;
ger of being undone, unless timely care was taken to&#xD;
prevent it. And therefore this verse seems to be an&#xD;
answer to the Church's prayers, flying to her Lord for&#xD;
refuge, who, seeing that her danger is not greater from&#xD;
tyranny than from false teachers, calls upon the Apos-&#xD;
tles, Bishops, and Pastors of the Church,' to seek for&#xD;
them, and to take them, or expose them, in their&#xD;
craftiness. And that, while they were young,-before&#xD;
they had gained strength and power; otherwise, their&#xD;
'vain babblings' would ' increase unto- more ungodhi-&#xD;

ii. 16,17. Especially, when the Church was but newly&#xD;
planted, and those seducers applied themselves chiefly&#xD;
to such as but recently received the Faith; or to weak&#xD;
and unsettled people, who were easily caught by them,&#xD;
unless great care were taken to discover their frauds,&#xD;
and to confute their sophistry. 'Twas the taking of&#xD;
thesefoxes, as Theodoret expounds it, and S. Bernard&#xD;
also; who observes, that he saith, 'Take to us the foxes,'&#xD;
i. e. Sibi et Sponste,-unto Himself and to His Spouse.&#xD;
As much as to say, If it be possible, let them be recon-&#xD;
ciled to the Holy Church, and brought back to the true&#xD;
faith.&#xD;
" If that could not be, then other methods succeeded;&#xD;
and the Apostle delivered 2p such dangerous deceivers&#xD;
unto Satan, which was a punishment that included in it&#xD;
bodily affliction, that they might learn not to blas-&#xD;

certain scribe came and said unto him, Master, I will&#xD;

saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of&#xD;

110     THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MR. BLEMMERTON DOING A HARD THING. A SURPRISE, THAT&#xD;
DOES NOT SET WELL. MR. FRIENDLY.&#xD;
A rEw days after the sayings and doings at Mrs.&#xD;
Blemmerton's party, heretofore recited, and the day be-&#xD;
fore that on which the remnant of the household effects&#xD;
of the deceased William Wallace were to be sold at&#xD;
vendue, to satisfy the rent duesto Mr. Llemmerton, oc-&#xD;
curred two remarkable episodes in the history of the&#xD;
aforesaid Blemmertons; episodes, apparently trivial in&#xD;
themselves, but, in the sequel, of considerable impor-&#xD;
tance.&#xD;
Seated at his desk in his counting-room, ere yet the&#xD;
day's business was fairly under way, Mr. Blemmerton,&#xD;
at the hands of the penny-post, received Mr. Love-&#xD;
good's letter.&#xD;
"Now we shall see !" ejaculated he, with a chuckle.&#xD;
He broke the seal,--and lo, as the reader is aware,&#xD;
there was a curt refusal, and that very curtness was, if&#xD;
any thing, its most disagreeable point. He dropped&#xD;
the letter, knit his brow, and would have muttered and&#xD;
murmured a good many hard things, about preachers&#xD;
in general and Mr. Lovegood in particular; such as,&#xD;
they are a set of conceited asses, with more brass than&#xD;
brains, etc. But, at that moment, be it said for the&#xD;
good of the clergy in general, his attention was called&#xD;
in another direction; and your heads were spared, you&#xD;

sometimes buffeted and abused, but more frequently&#xD;
kindly treated race, that a portion of that ire might fall&#xD;
on one who had already borne the rude blast, and shiv-&#xD;
ered beneath its breath, as the ship dismantled in the&#xD;
storm, lashed and driven by the waves and winds.&#xD;
" Ah, it's you, is it ?" said he, addressing little Agnes&#xD;
Wallace, who stood mute and tremulous at the threshold&#xD;
of the counting-room. "And what do you want now?&#xD;
It's useless to trouble me any more on that subject.&#xD;
The rent must be paid. I can't afford to lose any thing&#xD;
more, nor can I grant any indulgence. And if you are&#xD;
poor, it's your own fault. No one in this flourishing&#xD;
country need be poor, if he is industrious and economi-&#xD;
cal. Besides, there is an alms-house. You can go to&#xD;
that. I am taxed enough for its support, and that's all&#xD;
I am willing to do."&#xD;
"'But," said Agnes, brushing the tears from her eyes,&#xD;
and assured by the confidence which her present mis-&#xD;
sion inspired, "I did not come a-begging, Sir, nor to&#xD;
ask any indulgence; I came to pay you your rent."&#xD;
" Pay me my rent ! I should like to know where you&#xD;
got the money, since you are so poor ?" "I have the&#xD;
money here, Sir, all ready to pay the debt." "Ah, ha,&#xD;
I see. There is some trick. Some one has been made&#xD;
to suffer for this. I'll be after seeing into this affair.&#xD;
Come, now, tell me how you raised the money ; for I&#xD;
fear it's not all right, and I won't be a party to it."&#xD;
" I have been directed not to do that, Sir." "Ah, ha!&#xD;
I see. Did your father tell you that ?"&#xD;
"No, Sir," replied the little girl, bursting into a flood&#xD;
*of tears, " my poor father is dead and buried." " Dead,&#xD;

me see, what is it? Yes, ' Dust thou art.' And he is&#xD;
dead! Come, now, my child," said he in a softer tone,&#xD;
-for death has a cold grasp and icy hand, and&#xD;
brings a pallor even in the breath of his name,-" come,&#xD;
now, my child, tell me all about this. How did you&#xD;
get the money ?"&#xD;
It was the first soft word or tone Agnes had ever heard&#xD;
in that quarter; and it well-nigh robbed her of her&#xD;
good resolutions not to betray her trust and secret. "A&#xD;
soft answer turneth away wrath ;' much more does a&#xD;
soft, gentle word of tenderness, pry open and tear asun-&#xD;
der the heart, when it comes from one from whom we&#xD;
did not expect it, and from whom we have been accus-&#xD;
tomed to hear only words of keen reproach and harsh-&#xD;
ness. Forgive that little girl, then, if her childish heart&#xD;
melted, and she wavered for a moment between duty&#xD;
and the promptings of the inner fountains of her being,&#xD;
which had been touched.&#xD;
" A kind gentleman gave it to my poor sick mother,&#xD;
the night my dear father died. That is all that I can&#xD;
tell you. And here is a paper which he wrote, and told&#xD;
me to take it to you and get your signature to it, before&#xD;
I gave you the money." This was uttered with child-&#xD;
ish simplicity. Agnes did not comprehend the cutting&#xD;
rebuke, the terrible reproach conveyed in these words.&#xD;
This, even the obdurate Blemmerton did not fail to see ;&#xD;
and it was not without its effect. . He changed counte-&#xD;
nance ; and there, in the presence of an innocent, sim-&#xD;
ple-minded little child, he felt cowed, awe-stricken,&#xD;
abashed. But it was not that his conscience was stirred&#xD;
or smitten. He saw that there was a guiding hand su-&#xD;
perior to that little child, which was to him like the&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             113&#xD;
handwriting on the wall at the impious feast of Bel-&#xD;
shazzar. That hand troubled him: it seemed to reveal&#xD;
those awful words, " Mene, mene, tekel upharsin !"&#xD;
" Who was the gentleman ? Did he tell you his&#xD;
name ?" " He did, Sir. But he told me not to divulge&#xD;
it to you." " And won't you tell me, my child ?"&#xD;
" No, Sir. I can only say that he was a kind, good&#xD;
gentleman, who met me accidentally, and learned of&#xD;
me that my poor father was dying, and went home&#xD;
with me and took pity on us."&#xD;
Here Mr. Blemmerton read the paper handed to him&#xD;
by Agnes. It was a receipt, and read as follows:&#xD;
"Nov. -, 18-.&#xD;
"$ 30. Received of Sarah Wallace, relict of Wil-&#xD;
liam Wallace, deceased, the sum of thirty dollars, in&#xD;
full of all demands for rent due Ime to this date; and I&#xD;
hereby discontinue the proceedings under which the&#xD;
household effects of the aforesaid Wallace were to have&#xD;
been sold on the    day of --, to satisfy the claim&#xD;
as aforesaid."&#xD;
"And I am to sign that paper, am I?" "Yes, Sir,&#xD;
or sell the furniture that remains to us; for so the gen-&#xD;
tleman directed me to say." Mr. Blemmerton made a&#xD;
tremulous, nervous signature, and received the money;&#xD;
whereupon Agnes handed him the following paper,&#xD;
written by the same unknown hand:&#xD;
"SipR: Take notice, that the wife and daughter of&#xD;
William Wallace, deceased, will no longer occupy&#xD;
that wretched tenement of yours in street. After&#xD;

the furniture of another dying man, whose death, too,&#xD;
was caused by devotion to your interests.&#xD;
" Yours,              ONE WHO KNOWs."&#xD;
Agnes took her departure, and Mr. Blemmerton is&#xD;
left alone to his reflections ; and, for humanity's sake,&#xD;
we also will leave him alone. He has his money. If&#xD;
the knife that cut the pound of flesh reeking with&#xD;
blood when it was drawn out, it must rest upon his own&#xD;
head. But there is an impenetrable mystery veiling&#xD;
the whole transaction, which annoys him. Who could&#xD;
the stranger have been ? Did he know him ? lie&#xD;
would have given the pitiful sum of dollars and cents&#xD;
he had just received, to have that mysterious veil lifted.&#xD;
Would that transaction come to light? Would it face&#xD;
him outside of the secret walls of that counting-room ?&#xD;
Guess on, Mr. Blmmerton; time reveals secrets; and&#xD;
time, perchance, will reveal this.&#xD;
Once more we pass that,.rickety, woe-begone old&#xD;
house in      street. The winds sigh through the&#xD;
crevices ; the old stairway by which we ascended at&#xD;
the gable, rocks and rattles, as it did on that dark,&#xD;
shivering night; but now it is tenantless. The troubled&#xD;
and sorrowing are gone. The winds of heaven no&#xD;
longer respond to the sighs of the broken-hearted, the&#xD;
wounded, and the bruised. Sweep on, ye winds of&#xD;
heaven, ye blessed voices from the courts of God; ye&#xD;
bring but mementoes of a Father's love. Play on in&#xD;
your gleesome frolicking, through the paneless sashes&#xD;
and glaring cracks ; shake the old tenement irk your&#xD;
mirth or sadness; ye no longer disturb the living nor&#xD;

the dead. The dead sleeps with his fathers ; the mourner&#xD;
has gone home; that history is written in the records&#xD;
on high!&#xD;
" But the living," you say, "where are they ?" Go&#xD;
with me, and I will show you. We must take an oin-&#xD;
nibus, for our destination is in the northern part of the&#xD;
city. Away we rattle up a great broad street, which&#xD;
is all whirl and commotion. We roll along now slowly,&#xD;
now we spur up; presently we pause to pick up a pas-&#xD;
senger, now to let one out. There, now pull up. We&#xD;
get out here. Now this way. Now we go down this&#xD;
street; we shall soon-be there. 'We enter a neat, and a&#xD;
very cleanly street; and here before us is a block of tidy&#xD;
buildings, small but comfortable. These dwellings&#xD;
have an humble look, in contrast with many of the im-&#xD;
posing buildings in the neighborhood ; but still there&#xD;
is an air of snugness and tidiness about them, cheering&#xD;
to behold, after leaving that barren, desolate, cheerless-&#xD;
looking tenement which we have just noted.&#xD;
This block of buildings has been erected by Mr.&#xD;
Friendly, for the accommodation of the mechanics in&#xD;
his employ, and those whose means are limited, but to&#xD;
whom comfort and convenience are as necessary and&#xD;
welcome as they are to the affluent. Mr. Friendly&#xD;

hearted men, who, in the investment of his-money, has&#xD;
more at heart than the mere per centage. Ie consid-&#xD;

is his duty to consult the well-being of his tenants;&#xD;
and it is his delight and pleasure to do so. Therefore,&#xD;
in all his houses you will find due and scrupulous regard&#xD;
paid to convenience. And he builds such tenements,&#xD;

&#xD;
for the accommodation of the hands in his employ, and&#xD;
others who may seek them, not valuing the trifling ad-&#xD;
ditional costs, nor increasing the rent on that account.&#xD;
Year by year is he investing in this way his surplus&#xD;
funds, thus ameliorating the condition of the laboring&#xD;
man, contributing to his health and happiness, and&#xD;
affording him  a pleasant and convenient home, at&#xD;
moderate rates. And many are the blessings that are&#xD;
invoked on his head. Go on, Mr. Friendly, in your&#xD;
quiet, unpretending way. The Lord beholds and marks.&#xD;
You are doing more for the real benefit of your race,&#xD;
than many who make more noise in the world about&#xD;
their love of the dear people.&#xD;
Here, walk in. It is, indeed, the abode of poverty,&#xD;
but not of wretchedness. A kind hand has added a&#xD;
plain carpet, and some other articles of comfort, to the&#xD;
meager stock of Mrs. Wallace's furniture. Every thing&#xD;
about the room is clean and tidy. The stove is bright;&#xD;
and the cheerful fire imparts a home-feeling to the in-&#xD;
nates. An old walnut table stands against the wall&#xD;
on one side, over which hangs a small, poor man's&#xD;
mirror, which has seen better days; and a few old&#xD;
chairs, scattered here and there in order. And a cup-&#xD;
board, half open, reveals a small lot of plain, old-&#xD;
fashioned china. These make complete the humble&#xD;
apartment into which we are ushered. As you cast&#xD;
your eye casually towards the cupboard, you behold .a&#xD;
silver cup, of antique style, heavily wrought. This&#xD;
you would like to examine; for it is really a curiosity.&#xD;
It bears the initials F. G., and seems like a relic of other&#xD;
and better days. There is a mystery about that old&#xD;
silver cup : it has a story and a moral, you fancy, which&#xD;
&#xD;
you would like to have revealed; but a sense of pro-&#xD;
priety silences your curiosity.&#xD;
And now cast your eyes around. The walls are&#xD;
neatly papered. Throughout the house, there are pipes,&#xD;
conveying water to all the apartments ; in the attic there&#xD;
is a bathing-room, fitted with pipes for warm and cold&#xD;
baths; there are two neat chambers above, each with&#xD;
its wardrobe attached. On the first and second floors,&#xD;
each, there is a hall communicating with the front door;&#xD;
on the first floor are two neat parlors, and a convenient&#xD;
kitchen, with its bake-oven, wash-room, cistern, and&#xD;
pantries; a warm, dry, tight cellar completes the inter-&#xD;
nal arrangements. Every thing here bears inspection,&#xD;
and wears the appearance of comfort and convenience.&#xD;
Mrs. Wallace bears the marks of sore trials and dis-&#xD;
ease. The destroyer, we fear, has but too surely set his&#xD;
seal upon her. She is not long for earth. Her heavy&#xD;
afflictions of mind and body have been too much for&#xD;
her frail constitution; and she is yielding fast to the&#xD;
stroke.  Little Agnes is stitching collars; and her&#xD;
mother sits by a lamp, reading to her from the Bible.&#xD;
11er Prayer-Book lies by her, on the little stand. It is&#xD;
early yet for a lamp; but Mrs. Wallace's eyes have&#xD;
grown weak under disease and long vigils. She is now&#xD;
barely able to sit up and read a few lines, for her own&#xD;
and her daughter's consolation, from that treasure-book&#xD;
of divine love.&#xD;
It is good for us to be here, to behold the calm, holy&#xD;
resignation of that uncomplaining spirit, which seems&#xD;
already to be clothed, or clothing itself, for the spirit-&#xD;
world. We seem to catch whispers, as if angels were&#xD;
passing about the room and discoursing of heavenly&#xD;

A ring at the bell. Little Agnes runs to the door;&#xD;
a small, spare man, with quick, sparkling eyes, and&#xD;
sedate countenance, enters. "How do you do to-night?&#xD;
I hope you are better, Mrs. Wallace. And this is your&#xD;
little daughter Agnes? And these friends? Well,&#xD;
never mind: I've seen this gentleman before. If there&#xD;
is any thing more needed in this house for your com-&#xD;
fort, Mrs. Wallace, let me know; it shall be provided.&#xD;
A friend paid me your rent to-day six months in ad-&#xD;
vance. But,-but,-well, well, it matters not. I know&#xD;
all. Please receive that, Madam," handing her, or&#xD;
rather placing on the stand at her side, a small pack-&#xD;
age. "There, please say nothing; it's all right. Good-&#xD;
night; good-night. I can't stay longer. Hope you will&#xD;
do well. God bless you and your little daughter." And&#xD;
Mr. Friendly was off, after giving into the widow's hand&#xD;
a good portion of the rent he had received.&#xD;
Go, happy man, and God Almighty bless thee ! The&#xD;
gift that fell from thy hands was seen and counted by&#xD;
an angel, who flew overjoyed to heaven, and his com-&#xD;
panions pressed around him and caught his words as he&#xD;
told them out to the recording angel! Thou shalt be&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE B.'s IN TROUBLE,-COGITATIONS]--THE TRAINING OF&#xD;
CHILDREN.&#xD;
MR. BLEMMERTON hurried.home at an early hour, that&#xD;
afternoon. "In the multitude of counsellors there is&#xD;
wisdom." Happy thought ! Mr. B. will improve it,&#xD;
by calling a council that evening, not exactly of war,&#xD;
but of device and advice. So he delayed not to de-&#xD;
spatch a messenger to Mrs. Fussy, Mrs. Nochurch, and&#xD;
Mrs. Fastidious, earnestly requesting their presence at&#xD;
his house after tea.&#xD;
Something of importance was certainly on hand.&#xD;
This Mrs. Fussy knew fill well; and, by a sort of in-&#xD;
stinctive prescience, she knew what it was. So, before&#xD;
the messenger was out of sight, she was bonneted and&#xD;
off. She ran in first to see Mrs. Quiet. "Mrs. Quiet,&#xD;
have you been sent for, to go to Mr. Blemmerton's this&#xD;
evening ?" This question was simply an introductory.&#xD;
She knew Mrs. Quiet had not been sent for. "No, I&#xD;
have not." "Dear me, what can be going on? I have&#xD;
just been sent for, to go there after tea; and the girl&#xD;
told me she had several other ladies to invite. Some-&#xD;
thing is on foot, you may depend. I guess they have&#xD;
heard that Mr. Lovegood will accept the call; or per-&#xD;
haps they have heard that he will not. Which do you&#xD;
think it is, Mrs. Quiet ?"  "Really, I cannot say; but&#xD;
neither, I apprehend. Mr. Quiet wrote to Mr. Love-&#xD;
&#xD;
good; and I apprehend when there is a reply he will&#xD;
receive it,-as yet he has received no intelligence from&#xD;
him." "Well, how strange ! I do wonder what is&#xD;
going on&#xD;
Meantime Mrs. Nochurch pays a flying visit to her&#xD;
Presbyterian neighbor, who takes a lively interest in&#xD;
the affairs of St.  's Church, and is wonderfully in-&#xD;
telligent on the subjects of Puseyism, iigh-Church,&#xD;
etc., and from her heart pities all Churchmen who are&#xD;
so silly as to be "tied," as she says, "to forms and cere-&#xD;
monies," and to hold that "barbarous idea of the dark&#xD;
ages, the Apostolic succession."  "You don't say so !"&#xD;
exclaims Mrs. Presbyterian, in reply to Mrs. Nochurch's&#xD;
announcement. "It's too good almost to be believed."&#xD;
"I do verily believe it! He must have declined, and&#xD;
I am so glad; for I did not want that Mr. Lovegood to&#xD;
come here. Mrs. Blemmerton says lie is a rank Pusey-&#xD;
ite. She said Mr. Blemmerton said so; for he knew&#xD;
that lie bowed in the Creed, and this is one of the signs.&#xD;
Discerning people read such matters very easily. I am&#xD;
right glad. I hope he has declined; for we want no&#xD;
unchurching of other Churches !"&#xD;
Mrs. Fussy, as she runs round, meets Mrs. Fastidious.&#xD;
"Dear Mrs..Fussy, I am happy to meet you. Have&#xD;
you heard the news ? Is it so ? Can it be possible ? I&#xD;
did not want Mr. Lovegood for our pastor; for I've&#xD;
been told that he is not at all suited to us. They say&#xD;
he is not a popular preacher; at least that he is not&#xD;
eloquent enough for us. And I am sure if that be the&#xD;
case, I cannot go to church in the afternoon; for a dull,&#xD;
prosy preacher would not keep my eyes open. And&#xD;
they say, if we stay at home in the afternoon, we shall&#xD;

&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
be sure to hear of it. 0, dear Mrs. Fussy, just think&#xD;
of that ! It is unbearable !"&#xD;
Before eight o'clock that little council was in session.&#xD;
Business opened by the reading of Mr. Lovegood's let-&#xD;
ter to Mr. Blemmerton, which the reader will remember&#xD;
was simply a refusal to preach what Mr. B. called a&#xD;
trial sermon. The merits and demerits of the aforesaid&#xD;
letter were freely discussed. As to merit they could&#xD;
see none in it, except that, as the ladies understood it,&#xD;
it was a declining of the call to the Church. This&#xD;
they deemed highly satisfactory, and so declared unani-&#xD;
mously. But they had no conception of a call to St.&#xD;
's Church being entertained with so much indiffer-&#xD;
ence. He might have gone a little more into details;&#xD;
have been more complaisant and respectful to Mr.&#xD;
Blemmerton and the vestry. But they supposed it was&#xD;
characteristic !&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Blemmerton," remarked Mrs. Fastidious,&#xD;
"if we could only get Mr. Powerful here, whom I&#xD;
heard last summer at    , we should be made. Ie is&#xD;
so eloquent; so graceful in his delivery; has such a&#xD;
soft, sweet voice; and is so captivating ! 0, 1 do wish&#xD;
we could get him in St.    's Church ! And I am&#xD;
sure he would come; for Mrs. Graceful told me that he&#xD;
ought to have a more important field of labor; that a&#xD;
man of his talent was buried alive where he is. Now,&#xD;
can't you make an effort to get Mr. Powerful for us?"&#xD;
No, no. Mr. Blemmerton's skirts are now clear!&#xD;
It's useless for him to try to do any thing. All his&#xD;
efforts for the good of the congregation have been op-&#xD;
posed. He is now done, and will fall back on his dig-&#xD;
nity. "Let them have their own way. Let them have&#xD;
&#xD;
s,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
their own way," said he. Mrs. Nochurch thought, that&#xD;
"Dr. Ranter would be the best choice they could make-&#xD;
for he has extemporary prayers in his Sunday-school&#xD;
room during the week-day evenings; is very friendly&#xD;
with the Presbyterians; sometimes preaches for them;&#xD;
and is such a good, evangelical man." She was sure,&#xD;
if they called him, a good many Presbyterians would&#xD;
come to church, for Mrs. Presbyterian had told her so.&#xD;
Mrs. Fussy had one objection to Mr. Lovegood, which&#xD;
as -yet she had not named; and she had just heard it&#xD;
that day. "They say he is not married. And, dear&#xD;
me, what do we want with a high and dry old bache-&#xD;
lor !" This is news to Mrs. Blemmerton. She was not&#xD;
aware of this before. But, for her Apart, she could see&#xD;
nothing so awful in his being. unmarried. She thought&#xD;
he might get married. She reckoned, among so many&#xD;
interesting, intelligent single ladies in the congregation,&#xD;
he might get a suitable wife ; if he were not too ugly&#xD;
and unpopular.&#xD;
"Yes," said Mrs. Fastidious, smiling, "there is Nanny&#xD;
Jumper, and Jennie Smart, and Alice Smooth, and-&#xD;
and D   -"  "O, no-no-no !" exclaimed Mrs. Blem-&#xD;
merton, " don't name such a thing !"&#xD;
So the ladies dispersed after all, in a good humor,&#xD;
which happy state was brought about at the expense of&#xD;
the prospective Mrs. Lovegood. It acted like a charm&#xD;
on Mrs. Blemmerton; for, though she had said nothing,&#xD;
yet she had a great deal in store. But the announce-&#xD;
ment of the fact that Mr. Lovegood was a.single man,&#xD;
mollified her very much, and made her gentle and ami-&#xD;
able towards everybody, and particularly so towards&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood. Mrs. Fastidious, too, had come near&#xD;

124     THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
touching a spring, in enumerating suitable young ladies.&#xD;
The mere suggestion of a marriage, or the naming of a&#xD;
wedding, on such an occasion, is always sure ito bring&#xD;
about a happy equilibrium. It puts everybody in a&#xD;
good humor; it acts like oil poured on the troubled&#xD;
waves.&#xD;
And the result? Simply, as usual on such occasions,&#xD;
a misunderstanding. The news flew about the congre-&#xD;
gation, the next day, that Mr. Lovegood had declined&#xD;
the call; and the strangest part of the story was, that&#xD;
the declining was forwarded to Mr. Blenmerton.&#xD;
After the aforesaid ladies took their departure, Mr.&#xD;
Blemmerton recounted to his wife and daughters the&#xD;
mysterious transaction between himself and Agnes&#xD;
Wallace. That he had not named to his visitors; for&#xD;
it involved a secret worth keeping. He entered into&#xD;
every particular, not omitting to name the receipt and&#xD;
the contents of the note signed, "One who knows."&#xD;
" Who can that mysterious stranger be ?" said he. Mrs.&#xD;
B., though uniformly apt at guessing, was completely&#xD;
tongue-tied. She hadn't the most remote idea.&#xD;
Miss Deliah Airmyth thought it might possibly be&#xD;
Mr. Quiet, as she had heard it whispered "that he was&#xD;
a curious old man." "INo, it cannot be Mr. Quiet,"&#xD;
said he; "for she said he was a stranger; by which I&#xD;
suppose she meant some one that I do not know."&#xD;
"Ah ! that reminds mme, pa," said Miss Julia Jasper.&#xD;
And here Miss Julia Jasper repeats.the remarks she&#xD;
made to Mr. Heartful the night of the party, about&#xD;
Agnes Wallace's calling at the door to see her father;&#xD;
and also what Mr. Ileartful related of his having met a&#xD;
little girl the same night, and accompanied her home,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             125&#xD;
and been with her father when, he died.   " How&#xD;
strange !" said the father. "Yes, father," continued&#xD;
Miss Julia Jasper, "it must have been Mr. Heartful;&#xD;
for I remember that he seemed annoyed at my remarks ;&#xD;
he laid great stress on his words, andspoke signifi-&#xD;
cantly."&#xD;
" 0, Julia !" said Mrs. B., "how could you have been&#xD;
so foolish as to speak about such matters with Mr.&#xD;
Hleartful? You are very much. to blame. Oh, dear, I&#xD;
can't forgive you! He is such a nice gentleman. I&#xD;
gave my party with a view of getting him here, as soon&#xD;
as I heard he was in town. And now this spoils all&#xD;
my hopes."  Poor Miss Julia burst into tears. The&#xD;
Blemmertons are all exceedingly uncomfortable. We&#xD;
pity them; but folly, sooner or later, is sure to bring its&#xD;
reward.&#xD;
Miss Deliah Airmyth reminds her father, that Mr.&#xD;
Heartful had, a day or so before, gone to pay a visit at&#xD;
Heartfulville. She had heard it that afternoon, while&#xD;
out taking a walk. " And this," said Mrs. B., " accounts&#xD;
for that letter from Mr. Lovegood. Mr. Ileartful has&#xD;
talked with him. And no doubt Mr. Lovegood has&#xD;
heard all about the Wallaces and the rent. 0, Julia,&#xD;
Julia! how could you have done so ! I'm ruined, I'm&#xD;
ruined!"&#xD;
And herein Mrs. B. takes trouble on interest; but a&#xD;
guilty conscience is its own accuser. It wraps itself in&#xD;
a shadowy cloud, which has the power of reflection,&#xD;
and throws back what it fancies others see and know.&#xD;
Mr. lHeartftl had not exchanged a word with Mr. Love-&#xD;
good on such a topic; but it was easy for Mrs. Blem&#xD;
merton to imagine that lie had. And now, instead of&#xD;

126     THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,'&#xD;
&#xD;
pining over the sin involved in their treatment of the&#xD;
Wallaces, she was mainly, if not solely, grieved, that&#xD;
she saw in these-transactions a formidable barrier placed&#xD;
in the way of her hopes and aspirations. Sin ever car-&#xD;
ries its lash and sting with it; and family sins descend&#xD;
to remote generations, wind themselves through, and&#xD;
entwine themselves about, the members of a family in&#xD;
all their ways and works-.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Blemmerton, in the training of their&#xD;
daughters, had lost sight of the true aims and ends of&#xD;
life. Had they themselves been actuated by good mo-&#xD;
tives and sound principles, they would have been spared&#xD;
such reflections as they were now compelled to make.&#xD;
But the children had copied from the parents; and the&#xD;
example was patented. And here we have but an epit-&#xD;
ome of what must fall to their lot through life, and to&#xD;
their children's children after them, unless, by the grace&#xD;
of God, they are led to see the error of their way, and&#xD;
hasten to repent, and amend, as far as possible, what.&#xD;
they have done amiss.&#xD;
0 what a blessed treasure is a good wife ! a good&#xD;
mother ! 0 ye angels of light and purity! 0 ye spirits&#xD;
of the holy and the just, rise up and call her blessed !&#xD;
The good mother will suppress in her daughter the&#xD;
subtle poison of vanity, pride of dress and fashion,&#xD;
and fondness for show; and will teach her, that woman&#xD;
has a higher, nobler sphere in life than the merely sen-&#xD;
timental. She will not permit her to be deceived by such&#xD;
coined phrases as "feminine accomplishments,"-by&#xD;
which is meant only the accouplement of worldliness with&#xD;
a fashionable education,-into the belief that woman is&#xD;
fitted only for that which is light and trifling. But she&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              127&#xD;
begins with her daughter at an early age, and endeav-&#xD;
ors to point out to her her true sphere, her true stand-&#xD;
point in the universe of mind1; to draw out her spiritual&#xD;
nature ; to teach her, that she is designed by Provi-&#xD;
dence for more than a toy or plaything, or a mere dream-&#xD;
er in the world; that it is her office, to soothe the sor-&#xD;
rowings of humanity, to be its kindly and gentle moni-&#xD;
tor, to pour the oil of joy and gladness upon the troub-&#xD;
led waves of its sea of life, and to gild all its pathway&#xD;
with sunshine ; and to aid her, in her efforts and aspi-&#xD;
rations to gather the fruits which cluster on the tree of&#xD;
knowledge, to pluck the flowers,-yea, and wreathe&#xD;
them about her brow,-that bloom along the pathway&#xD;
of usefulness.&#xD;
On a theme so important, we beg leave to turn aside&#xD;
awhile, to throw out a few chance suggestions. It can&#xD;
scarcely be denied, that the routine of what is termed&#xD;
fashionable life," is unfavorable to the growth of&#xD;
sound morals and solid piety. There is a rottenness at&#xD;
the very heart of much of our conventional formality;&#xD;
in its ostentation, extravagance, luxury, idleness, dissi-&#xD;
pation, gossiping, and their attendant evils in example,&#xD;
and the rivalries, jealousies, and bickerings growing out&#xD;
of them, that stagnates the healthful growth of virtue&#xD;
and religion. And one of its evil effects, and one be-&#xD;
ginning to be sorely felt, is its deteriorating power and&#xD;
.influence over the young. Devotion to the world, is al-&#xD;
lowed to rob parents of time to perform their duty to&#xD;
their children. This had been the great fault of the&#xD;
Blemmertons. When they set out in life, their great&#xD;
struggle was for the "Amighty Dollar."  They had&#xD;
but one fixed, settled aim and purpose in life. That was&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7334-00000065"/>&#xD;
128     THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
to accumulate wealth: that accomplished, their desires&#xD;
took another turn. Ambition was now their guiding,&#xD;
motive ; to be accounted ,of consequence, to make a&#xD;
show in the world, to effect advantageous marriages for&#xD;
their daughters: these were the impulses that prompt-&#xD;
ed and guided all their actions. We cannot fail to see,&#xD;
then, that however competent they might have been, to&#xD;
form  and mould the dispositions of their daughters&#xD;
aright, had they been actuated by true Christian princi-&#xD;
ples, the world interposed a .fearful barrier ; and they&#xD;
were suffered to come to maturity, dwarfed and biased,&#xD;
for lack of proper management of their passions and af-&#xD;
fections while young.&#xD;
And herein lies the root of a great wrong in the n ur-&#xD;
ture of children :-lst, in yielding to their whims and&#xD;
caprices. See that little fellow rubbing his eyes and&#xD;
sobbing : "Mamma, give me a cake."  Hear mamma,&#xD;
petulantly, as she casts aside her work : ", bless me,&#xD;
what a plague! There, take it, and begone !" And&#xD;
away goes the little fellow in ecstasies. lie managed&#xD;
his mother. He knew her weak point, and skilfully&#xD;
stormed it. Ay, more; he learned his lesson. You&#xD;
smile at this: it is a small matter. True. Your child&#xD;
also is small; now he asks only a small thing;y- but,&#xD;
teach him his lesson, yield to all his tears, and soon he&#xD;
will make demands that will tear asunder your heart-&#xD;
strings, and leave them bleeding.&#xD;
2d. In the manner of correcting children, applying&#xD;
discipline in a pet or passion, not doing it in love, and&#xD;
making the child feel that it is done, not to gratify your&#xD;
own passion, nor simply because you have the power, but&#xD;
because it is your duty to God and to your child, thus&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             129&#xD;
manifesting and carrying in your handlove, gentleness,&#xD;
affection, sanctified by the authority which cometh&#xD;
down from the "Father of lights, with whom is no va-&#xD;
riableness, neither shadow of turning."&#xD;
3d. In accounting childish anger a trifling thing,&#xD;
when in fact it requires the nicest management. Your&#xD;
little boy or girl falls into a pet or pout, and you give it&#xD;
a lump of sugar to cure the ailment. He or she dashes&#xD;
it against the floor and pouts the more. Then "mam-&#xD;
ma's son or daughter is very naughty ;" and mamma&#xD;
plies the sugar again, and again it is dashed on the&#xD;
floor. " Very well, you naughty child ; now wait till I&#xD;
pick it up." And then most likely the scene ends in a cry,&#xD;
and perhaps a sudden or angered chastisement. Is no&#xD;
wrong committed ? Certainly there is; for, nothing has&#xD;
been done to counteract that childish anger. The child&#xD;
has not been taught, that its pettishness was wrong;&#xD;
but that mamma chastised it because she was angry:&#xD;
hence, after all, it learned as a lesson, that its passion&#xD;
was but a small thing in contrast with the parent's dis-&#xD;
pleasure. And the parent's duty is not discharged, un-&#xD;
til the child is taught to realize, as fully as possible,.&#xD;
that its anger was sinful, and that now it must be angry&#xD;
and grieved at the sin it has committed. Or again:&#xD;
your child falls against a chair and hurtsitself. Its first&#xD;
impulse is apt to be a desire to hurt the chair in return.&#xD;
And the parent or nurse, to quiet the child, strikes the&#xD;
chair a smart blow. "Now, you naughty chair, take&#xD;
that, for hurting little  ."  The child smiles,its tears&#xD;
are dried, but a great wrong has been committed. In&#xD;
fact, it would have been better, had the child cried the&#xD;
day out, than that any such thing should have been&#xD;
6e&#xD;

130&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BLEMMERToNs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
done ; for it teaches the child, that such manifestations&#xD;
of anger, mingled with a desire of revenge, are right,&#xD;
and tends to fix the habit of revenge in the heart.&#xD;
4th. In controlling the self-love of children. It al-&#xD;
ways manifests itself very strongly. Indeed, it may&#xD;
be safely asserted, that selfishness develops itself in&#xD;
children, first of all the passions or affections, and be-&#xD;
nevolence the last, perhaps ; at least, its development&#xD;
is of much slower growth. " Meum     and tuium" are&#xD;
soon understood by a child, and strongly manifested ;&#xD;
while the opposite, benevolence, the desire of giving&#xD;
away what is mine, for the benefit of another, is not so&#xD;
easily appreciated. And on this point it cannot be de-&#xD;
nied, that many parents grievously err. There are, in-&#xD;
deed, honorable exceptions ; but it must be owned, that,&#xD;
both by precept and example, the majority of parents&#xD;
do cultivate, draw out, and establish in the breasts of&#xD;
their children, the principle of selfishness, while all&#xD;
their kindly, generous, benevolent feelings, are stifled,&#xD;
blunted, and repressed, for want of cultivation and de-&#xD;
velopment.&#xD;
But, while it must be acknowledged, that a purely&#xD;
selfish, sordid, grovelling disposition, is a very mean one,&#xD;
and one that should be suppressed in children, would&#xD;
we train them for their true sphere as creatures of two&#xD;
worlds ; let it not be lost sight of, that a spirit of ex-&#xD;
travagance and prodigality, the disposition of the spend-&#xD;
thrift, is as odious and sinful. It should, then, be the&#xD;
parent's aim, to teach the child, that the good things of&#xD;
this life are gifts from the Lord, bestowed upon us, not&#xD;
to be lavished in prodigality on our lusts and passions,&#xD;
nor to pamper pride and luxury, but to do good to our,&#xD;

&#xD;
fellow-men in our place and sphere, and so glorify our&#xD;
Father in heaven.&#xD;
The children of the wealthy are often indulged, to a&#xD;
shameful extent, in the sin of prodigality; and many&#xD;
are the tears which flow from broken hearts, in the&#xD;
wake of this portentous evil. Could we utter a word&#xD;
that would be heard and heeded on this point, we&#xD;
would say, that young persons should be allowed but&#xD;
little spending money, and of that the parent or guardian&#xD;
should take a strict account, requiring from the child&#xD;
as exact an account of the spending of every penny&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
The indulgence of the young with large supplies of&#xD;
pocket-money, is a great evil among the wealthy of our&#xD;
cities, and in our collegiate and boarding-school educa-&#xD;
tion. On the part of boys, it leads to suppers, cards,&#xD;
wine, the bar-room, and the theatre, unless there are&#xD;
powerful barriers in- the way. On the part of girls, it&#xD;
leads to extravagance in dress, and to the wretchedness&#xD;
of a pampered heart, inflated with pride of wealth and&#xD;
desire of ostentation.&#xD;
The history of Jacob and Esau opens to our view a&#xD;
striking picture; ,on the one hand, of covetousness, on&#xD;
the other, of prodigality. And it is well worth a care-&#xD;
ful consideration, in connection with what we have&#xD;
advanced. Jacob coveted the birthright; Esau de-&#xD;
spised it, or lightly esteemed it; and in the history,&#xD;
taken as a whole, we have a type of the results of&#xD;
family sins. The patriarch Isaac sinned, in rebelling&#xD;
against the will of the Lord ; Jacob and' his mother&#xD;
Rebekah, in coveting the birthright, and attempting to&#xD;
aid in bringing  about the declared will of heaven in&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
their faithless impatience; Esau, in despising his tenm -&#xD;
poral blessings. And hence, parents and children&#xD;
clouded over their after life with sorrow. In consider-&#xD;
ing this history, then, we behold the misery entailed on&#xD;
a whole family, by a single sin on the part of parents;&#xD;
and we learn something of the awful character of&#xD;
family sins, in their results upon posterity to remote&#xD;
generations.&#xD;
The patriarch Isaac intended to frustrate the will of&#xD;
God; and his declining days are rendered pitiable, on&#xD;
account of the unhappy quarrel between his sons.&#xD;
Rebekah had dealt treacherously with her husband,&#xD;
and is now miserable on account of the cheerless pros-&#xD;
pect before her. Esau despised his birthright, and now&#xD;
sips his folly in sorrow ; is enraged at the unjust con-&#xD;
duct of his brother, and burns with revenge. Jacob&#xD;
coveted the inheritance, and took unfair means to&#xD;
acquire it; and now he is obliged to fly from all his&#xD;
most cherished associations, into a strange land, for the&#xD;
preservation of his life. Oh, how it saddens the heart,&#xD;
when, years after, in the presence of Pharaoh, we hear&#xD;
him exclaim, " The days of the years of my pilgrimage&#xD;
have been a hundred and thirty years : few and evil&#xD;
have the days of the years of my life been !" Gen.&#xD;
xlvii. 8, 9.&#xD;
Jacob feels the lash of conscience; he obeys its&#xD;
behests ; the sin of his brother mitigates not his own;&#xD;
he repents him of his wickedness ; forsakes all; leaves&#xD;
the scene of strife ; passes from under his father's roof,&#xD;
where at least he ought to have been. secure ; turns his&#xD;
back on his happy home, his kind and loving parents,&#xD;
and the pleasant scenes of his childhood ; and with&#xD;
&#xD;

staff in hand, lonely and unprotected, he enters on his&#xD;
pilgrimage. 0 Jacob, the supplanter !  I see thee,&#xD;
Israel, a prince with God! Penitence shall wash out&#xD;
thy sin. A hard, a rugged life is before thee. But&#xD;
Faith looks on to the goal, and there is the crown of&#xD;
blessedness.&#xD;
Let us behold him at Bethel, also, and learn the&#xD;
measure of the work of the penitent, and mark the&#xD;
deep compassion of the Almighty, through His blessed&#xD;
Son, in watching over us and our little ones, in our&#xD;
weakness and waywardness ; and let us humble our-&#xD;
selves under His Almighty hand, repent of our sins and&#xD;
of our neglect to our offspring, and pray for pardon, and&#xD;
amend what we have done amiss, before the evil days&#xD;
draw nigh in which we shall find no peace.&#xD;
Jacob awakes out of sleep. The bright sun gilds the&#xD;
heavens; darkness has fled, and smiling Nature calls&#xD;
the patriarch to imitate her praise to the Almighty.&#xD;
The vision has past away. The ladder is removed.&#xD;
The angels have gone home. But the Lord is near, and&#xD;
Jacob is blessed. His soul is braced for a higher flight,&#xD;
and a wider range in the spiritual life. He sees God&#xD;
by faith. That ladder he knows is before him. Those&#xD;
blessed spirits are passing up and down, though he&#xD;
sees them not. And filled with solemn awe and rever-&#xD;
ence, he exclaims; "Surely the Lord is in this place,&#xD;
and I knew it not. How dreadful is this place! this is&#xD;
none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of&#xD;
heaven !"&#xD;
0, let us all remember, parents and children, and&#xD;
lay to heart the grievous sin of Esau. We, too, have&#xD;
a birthright, which we received at our baptism, pur--&#xD;

chased for and secured to us by the incarnation and&#xD;
passion of our Lord Jesus Christ ; even reconciliation&#xD;
with God and adoption into his family, and the crown-&#xD;
ing joys of His presence and glory. Are we, like Esau,&#xD;
selling them for naught? Then, alas ! we, too, may&#xD;
weep and lament when too late : "Bless me, even rme&#xD;
also, 0 my Father : and Esau lifted up his voice and&#xD;
wept !"&#xD;
To touch on all the joys and sorrows that mingle in&#xD;
this history, would be to write a volume. But there is&#xD;
one other picture, on which we would look for a mo-&#xD;
ment, ere we leave the deeply interesting story at which&#xD;
we have glanced.&#xD;
After a storm, the bow in the clouds cheers the heart.&#xD;
The bright sun, breaking through clouds and mists,&#xD;
after days of darkness, brings joy in its smile. So,&#xD;
after viewing the checkered scenes of a history from&#xD;
life, it is delightful to turn to some bright spot, which&#xD;
casts a radiance over the whole, and relieves the pic-&#xD;
ture of many of its saddening tints and colors. This&#xD;
we have in the meeting of the brothers, Jacob and&#xD;
Esau, after a long separation. After years of estrange-&#xD;
ment, time has wrought its changes, and grace has&#xD;
moulded the character.   Youthful ambition, impa-&#xD;
tience, and impetuosity, have had their day; the pas-&#xD;
sions have ceased to revolt against the will of God; and&#xD;
we find the patriarch Jacob journeying with all his&#xD;
family and wealth to the land of his brother Esau.&#xD;
Penitence has chastened and subdued his heart; and&#xD;
yet, remembering his youthful sin, he feared the anger&#xD;
and resentment of his brother. His sin, though re-&#xD;
pented of and pardoned, was not forgotten, and seems&#xD;

and presents to appease Esau.&#xD;
0 the work of grace that prompted him to seek re-&#xD;
conciliation ! And Esau comes out to meet him; for&#xD;
God has touched his heart, and changed it towards his&#xD;
brother. And there we behold the penitent, humble&#xD;
Jacob, "bowing seven time-s to the ground until he&#xD;
came near to his brother; and Esau ran to meet him,&#xD;
and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed&#xD;
him; and they wept." This is a lovely and affecting&#xD;
picture of the best impulses and affections of the human&#xD;
heart, and is scarcely surpassed by the meeting between&#xD;
Joseph and his brethren. "They meet, they converse,&#xD;
they love as brothers ought to do." And," 0 how good&#xD;
and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in&#xD;
unity !" "We apprehend a strife of fierce and angry&#xD;
looks, of reproachful words, of violence and blood.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. LOVEGOOD'S EARLY TROUBLES. THE COMMUNION OF&#xD;
SAINTS.&#xD;
WE must go back, some dozen years or more, in our&#xD;
story, and recount a few of the incidents in the life of&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, as they were developed in his parish at&#xD;
Heartfulville. We have said, that Mr. Lovegood was&#xD;
tenderly beloved by his flock. This is true. but it&#xD;
will be a mistake to suppose, that he was free from&#xD;
trouble and annoyances, of various kinds, and from dif-&#xD;
ferent sources. The ministerial life, with all its pleas-&#xD;
ures, is never free from trials.&#xD;
We care not how pleasant and fair the lines of a&#xD;
clergyman's lot are, yet everywhere will they be found.&#xD;
to intertwine, more or less, about the conditions of a&#xD;
probationary state, and the frailties and weaknesses in-&#xD;
cident to fallen humanity. It is the will of the Lord,&#xD;
that they who minister at His altars, and follow in the&#xD;
regeneration after Him, should partake with Him in&#xD;
sufferings, sorrows, reproaches, and chafing of the flesh,&#xD;
for His body's sake, the Church. A young man, on&#xD;
setting out in the ministerial office, finds his first trials,&#xD;
whether small or great, hard to endure; but, time and&#xD;
habit inure him to them; and, at last, he is prepared&#xD;
to meet them, as blessings for his spiritual good.&#xD;

tests of our true spiritual state, were it not that we are&#xD;
sometimes cast into the furnace? This tempers us to&#xD;
the task before us; this tends to certify to us whereof&#xD;
we are made. 0.,.how many hopes linger after, how&#xD;
many prayers follow, the young Herald of the Cross,&#xD;
when he goes forth to battle with the combined powers&#xD;
of darkness! Perhaps he goes a stranger to a strange&#xD;
land, not knowing what is before him: whether perils&#xD;
by land or perils by sea, shipwreck, or disease, or death.&#xD;
In the old church at home, he has been commissioned&#xD;
unto his work, and put his armor on ; in the old church&#xD;
at home, he has lifted up his heart and voice in prayer,&#xD;
and, with the full congregation of friends and neigh-&#xD;
bors, and loving relatives, he has repeated that glowing&#xD;
confession: "I believe in the Communion of Saints."&#xD;
But he never so fully realized it as now; now that lie&#xD;
goes a stranger unto a strange land. Ah! there is a&#xD;
mighty potency in that doctrine of the Communion of&#xD;
Saints, which, alas! but too many of us do not fully re-&#xD;
alize when we feel alone on the earth. Could our eyes&#xD;
be opened to invisible things, we should behold on all&#xD;
sides their wonders and tokens. We live by faith, in&#xD;
the splendor of the Gospel day. We realize but little&#xD;
of the awful mystery in which, day by day, we move&#xD;
in the mystical Communion of Saints, in the fellowship&#xD;
of the inhabitants of the Spirit-land, the angels of light,&#xD;
who are around us, to extend to us, in ways hidden and&#xD;
secret, the mercies of their anid our common Father.&#xD;
The angels are God's messengers unto us for good,&#xD;
and ministers from the courts above. In the old dis-&#xD;
pensation, the ministry of angels was conspicuous; and&#xD;
the prophets, especially Elisha, held wonderful commu-&#xD;

&#xD;
nications with those messengers of God. Of this we&#xD;
have a remarkable evidence in 2 Kings, vi. 17, etc.&#xD;
There was war between Syria and Israel. The king&#xD;
of Syria was sorely baffled, in all his plans of warfare.&#xD;
The Israelites seemed to understand, in advance, all his&#xD;
secret movements, and to be able to elude his wiles to&#xD;
entrap them; so he fancied that some of his warriors&#xD;
dealt treacherously with him, and lie accordingly ac-&#xD;
cused them. But he was told, that it all was the work&#xD;
of the prophet Elisha; that the prophet knew even the&#xD;
thoughts of his heart in his chamber, and revealed them&#xD;
to the king of Israel. The king of Syria determined,&#xD;
then, to capture the prophet, who resided at Dothan.&#xD;
His horses and chariots surrounded the city at night.&#xD;
In the morning, a servant of the prophet went out; and,&#xD;
seeing the formidable array of horses and chariots&#xD;
which surrounded the city, he returned in trepidation&#xD;
to his master, with the sad news, crying out, "Alas!&#xD;
my master, how shall we (1 ?"  But Elisha was not&#xD;
terrified. He knew, that lie was surrounded by the&#xD;
Lord's hosts: therefore lie said to him, "Fear not; for&#xD;
they that be with us are more than they that be with&#xD;
them." "And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray&#xD;
Thee open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord&#xD;
opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw; and,&#xD;
behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of&#xD;
fire round about Elisha."&#xD;
So the camp of God is ever round His faithful chil-&#xD;
dren. These were the holy angels whom this young&#xD;
man saw, who were at hand ready to guard his master,&#xD;
in ways secret to him. And as they were far more&#xD;
powerful and numerous than the Assyrian host, his&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             189&#xD;
fears were stilled, when he beheld the prophet standing&#xD;
in the centre of that glorious camp, so encircled and&#xD;
defended as that none of his enemies could do him vio-&#xD;
lence. And was the prophet insensible to this invisible&#xD;
host which surrounded him? Nay; whether by faith&#xD;
or inspiration, he knew that they encamped about him.&#xD;
He enjoyed a citizenship in the unseen world; his&#xD;
citizenship was in heaven. His eye was made keen, to&#xD;
pierce the veil that shuts out invisible things, and to&#xD;
behold the legions of God, His horses and chariots of&#xD;
fire, round about him, for his protection and deliverance.&#xD;
lie had his hours of loneliness, when he felt solitary on&#xD;
the earth ; and yet he enjoyed the high privilege of&#xD;
knowing in what communion and fellowship he dwelt.&#xD;
He lived in the society of the court of heaven. And&#xD;
thus was revealed to him, in no small measure, that&#xD;
blessed Christian doctrine of the Communion of Saints.&#xD;
lie held communion and fellowship with all saints from&#xD;
the beginning; and, while emboldened by the imme-&#xD;
diate succor and presence of angels, he was animated&#xD;
and encouraged by the good examples of all those saints&#xD;
and servants of the Most High, whether patriarchs or&#xD;
prophets, priests or lawgivers, who had departed in the&#xD;
true faith and fear of God, and who, by their life of&#xD;
holiness, spake a lesson of the deepest interest, and&#xD;
seemed to surround him with their trophies, and urge&#xD;
him on to a manly combat with the enemies of God&#xD;
and of souls.&#xD;
Behold, too, and mark the horses and chariots of fire,&#xD;
by which the faithful Christian is surrounded. See&#xD;
low wonderfully this vision corresponds with the blessed&#xD;
privilege which the Apostle tells us is conferred on us.&#xD;

"Ye are come," says lie, "unto mount Sion, and unto&#xD;
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and&#xD;
to an innumerable company of angels, to the general&#xD;
assembly and church of the first-born, which are written&#xD;
in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits&#xD;
of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of&#xD;
the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that&#xD;
speaketh better things than that of Abel."&#xD;
0 what an host! How awful, yet how sublime, our&#xD;
privilege! There you have the mount, and here you&#xD;
behold Elisha, and an innumerable company of angels,&#xD;
and the spirits of the just. We with him dwell, as it&#xD;
were, beneath their shadow, and are baptized into the&#xD;
fellowship. The angels are our guardians; the saints&#xD;
of all ages, our ensamples; God is our Father, and&#xD;
Jesus Christ our Mediator. We dwell ii the very court&#xD;
of God, and of His eternal Son our Saviour, who died&#xD;
for us; and rose again, and ascended up on high, lead-&#xD;
ing captivity captive, and receiving gifts for men.&#xD;
And we say there is a potency in this doctrine, not&#xD;
always realized, even by those who are striving for the&#xD;
mastery. But, perhaps, we approach its true realiza-&#xD;
tion more nearly than at any other period, when we go&#xD;
forth from all we have known and twined our heart&#xD;
about, to mingle in new scenes and associations, or per-&#xD;
chance to feel desolate in the world, having few to syn-&#xD;
pathize with us, and none exactly to understand us, as&#xD;
those with whom we have journeyed long, or taken&#xD;
sweet counsel together. It is then, perhaps, if ever,&#xD;
while the flesh hangs about us, we feel the full strength&#xD;
of that holy bond, which holds in one mighty fellow-&#xD;

we feel the blessedness of the tie of the family relation-&#xD;
ship-in Christ Jesus; that though we are strangers and&#xD;
pilgrims, far away from home and friends, and kindly&#xD;
sympathies, we yet dwell in the heavenly court, and&#xD;
are surrounded by the Lord's hosts, with whom we have&#xD;
fellowship; and that we are akin indeed unto Imman-&#xD;
uel, and at last, when the weary way is run, we shall&#xD;
pass through the vale, and enter into rest.&#xD;
It was with a sad heart that Mr. Lovegood bade&#xD;
adieu to the home of his childhood, to enter on the&#xD;
duties of his new calling. How all the past gushed up&#xD;
into his heart, and the scenes of his youth, his happy'&#xD;
home, the tender solicitude of his honored parents, and&#xD;
all the associations that twined about his heart, crowded&#xD;
upon his memory, we need not relate.&#xD;
A few days brought him to his destination; and now&#xD;
before him lies a field of toil and privations, from which&#xD;
lie might have shrunk, had he been over-timid or&#xD;
cowardly. But he had counted the cost, and buckled&#xD;
on his armor. The church at Hleartfulville was vener-&#xD;
able from its antiquity; and the new Rector trod in the&#xD;
steps of a number of worthy clergymen, whose dust&#xD;
rested quietly in the consecrated and beautiful church-&#xD;
yard. But the last Rector had been one of those easy&#xD;
men, who had suffered things to take their own course.&#xD;
Ie was a good, worthy, and amiable man, but seemed&#xD;
never to have fully appreciated the Church's system.&#xD;
Consequently, the parishioners were but indifferently&#xD;
instructed in Church doctrines.&#xD;
Except here and there a few, who had acquainted&#xD;
themselves with distinctive Church principles, it may&#xD;
be said of the congregation, that they knew no differ-&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7334-00000072"/>&#xD;
142     THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
ence between the Church and Methodism and Presby.&#xD;
terianism, or any other ism. The old Rector had never&#xD;
troubled himself about such questions; not exactly be-&#xD;
cause he despised them, but because he deemed them&#xD;
unprofitable, and, for the most part, useless. It must&#xD;
be told that, with rare exceptions, it was not the fashion&#xD;
at that day, and in the region of Heartfulville especial-&#xD;
ly, to care much about the doctrines and principles of&#xD;
the Church. The congregation were not taught the&#xD;
apostolic succession, nor the sanctity of baptism, nor&#xD;
any thing about the sin of schism. They were not&#xD;
taught, that they were members of the Church, but of&#xD;
a Church; hence, if, after a brief trial, one did not&#xD;
happen to be pleased with this or that, he or she simply&#xD;
withdrew to "some other church," without remon-&#xD;
strance.&#xD;
You sympathize with a young man, alive to all the&#xD;
claims of the Church, in assuming such a charge. He&#xD;
needs more than your sympathies; he needs your&#xD;
prayers. And yet this was the proper field for Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood. He had enough of moral courage to meet&#xD;
every issue, and enough of prudence to avoid rashness.&#xD;
He was not long in measuring the ground and work&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
Owing to the stagnation in growth and life which&#xD;
always ensues when a parish "runs to seed," there had&#xD;
been, for several years, no Sunday School in connection&#xD;
with the Church. To revive this work, was Mr. L.'s&#xD;
first undertaking. A few days after entering upon his&#xD;
duties, he consulted with one of his female parishioners,&#xD;
a prominent lady, who thought it a capital idea, and&#xD;
one that should be carried into effect, without delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             143&#xD;
Now it appeared to Mr. IL., that this lady would be well&#xD;
adapted to the work of Superintendent of the female&#xD;
department. So he remarked to her, "Miss Bromley,&#xD;
you will, of course, take sufficient interest in this work,&#xD;
to allow me to name you as Superintendent of the fe-&#xD;
male department ?" "O, Mr. Lovegood, how could&#xD;
you think of such a thing! However, you are excusa-&#xD;
ble, as you have been here but a short time. Mrs. See-&#xD;
tary has been the Superintendent since I was a little&#xD;
girl; and I am sure it would give her great offence to&#xD;
be thrust aside, after all she has done for the Sunday&#xD;
School, in teaching, furnishing catechisms, tracts, etc.&#xD;
I hope you will not think of such a thing; indeed, it&#xD;
will not do to offend Mrs. Sectary. I am willing to be&#xD;
of any service in the Sunday School, but I can never&#xD;
think of supplanting Mrs. Sectary."&#xD;
"' But, Miss Bromley, Mrs. Sectary is a confirmed,&#xD;
rigid Presbyterian'; and I do not see how she is to be&#xD;
a Superintendent in a Church Sunday School, or how&#xD;
she can consistently proffer to teach the Church Cate-&#xD;
chisin. It involves an inconsistency that I can scarcely&#xD;
conceive possible."&#xD;
" But," remarked Miss Bromley, "we have no Church&#xD;
Catechism in the Sunday School. Mr. Slow never in-&#xD;
sisted on the Catechism's being taught; indeed, he gave&#xD;
the whole management of the school to Mrs. Sectary,&#xD;
in whom he had great confidence, as she certainly is&#xD;
a very pious and exemplary Christian. Still, I believe,&#xD;
if the Catechism were introduced, Mrs. Sectary would&#xD;
not care, provided she taught her class in her own&#xD;
way." Mr. Lovegood was a little nonplused. 11e&#xD;
thought it best to change the subject, as it promised to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7334-00000073"/>&#xD;
be unprofitable. And after remarking that he would&#xD;
think of the matter, and exchanging a few common-&#xD;
place remarks, he departed.&#xD;
Poor Mr. Lovegood! Here was a poser. Such a&#xD;
thing had never crossed his path. A Presbyterian lady&#xD;
Superintendent in a Sunday School of the Church; and&#xD;
Presbyterian doctrines, catechism. Hleigh-ho!&#xD;
Mr. L. spent that evening in his study, reflecting on&#xD;
his course, and maturing his plans. Here was a case&#xD;
that required management. To break in suddenly upon&#xD;
old-established usages, however wrong they may be in&#xD;
themselves, is apt to breed discord and confusion. Had&#xD;
it been a question merely between himself and Mrs.&#xD;
Sectary, it would not have occupied his thoughts a&#xD;
moment. But here, likely, a whole parish was to be&#xD;
stirred up, at the very beginning of his labors; and&#xD;
Mr. L. knew, that, although he would be right in taking&#xD;
such a course, he might fail to convince the parishioners&#xD;
that things ought not to continue as heretofore. So,&#xD;
after mature deliberation, he called the next clay to&#xD;
see Mrs. Sectary. He was kindly received, not, how-&#xD;
ever, in the most cordial manner. He soon learned&#xD;
from Mrs. Sectary what were her anticipations. She had&#xD;
no thought of yielding the time-honored situation, which&#xD;
had been conferred upon her in days gone by, by the&#xD;
good and charitable old Rector; and, indeed, by way&#xD;
of feeling Mr. Lovegood's pulse, she launched out in&#xD;
unmeasured terms against the exclusiveness and bigotry&#xD;
of a few semi-Papists, as she termed them, who had&#xD;
sprung up of late in the Episcopal Church, who would&#xD;
be so uncharitable as to unchurch other churches.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood permitted the old lady to be as wrathy&#xD;

as she pleased. He kept cool; and, before the confer-&#xD;
ence ended, they were right good friends. And he had&#xD;
so far ingratiated himself into her good opinion, not&#xD;
by any shadow of concession, but simply by good man-&#xD;
agement, as to have it conceded, that it was right, as&#xD;
it was an Episcopal School, Episcopal doctrines should&#xD;
be taught, and the Church Catechism systematically&#xD;
used. Prudence in this case proved to be the better.&#xD;
part of valor. Mrs. Sectary was to have a class in the&#xD;
Sunday School, and there was to be no Superintendent,&#xD;
male nor female, the Rector himself intending always&#xD;
to be present, and take the oversight.&#xD;
In a few weeks, every thing was under way in a&#xD;
Church-like manner ; and, reader, would you credit it,&#xD;
the old Presbyterian Superintendent had come down to&#xD;
a small A, B, C class ! Othello was fast losing his oc-&#xD;
cupation. And still more, Miss Bromley, Mrs. Sectary,&#xD;
every body, was satisfied. It was not long before Mrs.&#xD;
Sectary found, that age impaired her usefulness; and&#xD;
she retired altogether, leaving the field to the Rector.&#xD;
But we are ahead of our story. After parting with&#xD;
Mrs. Sectary, Mr. Lovegood repaired to the church,&#xD;
and examined the Sunday School Library. What was&#xD;
his surprise, to find it filled with Presbyterian books,&#xD;
tracts, catechisms, etc. Many of the tracts were ex-&#xD;
tremely objectionable, as, of course, were all the works&#xD;
he found, but especially the tracts; because, not content&#xD;
with simply teaching Presbyterianism, they pointedly&#xD;
assailed the Church in her Liturgy, offices, doctrines, etc.&#xD;
" This will never do," quoth Mr. Lovegood. "The&#xD;
books must remain, I suppose, till I can gradually work&#xD;
them out. I can control them; but these tracts and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7334-00000074"/>&#xD;
146&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONS; 0&#xD;
&#xD;
catechisms must vanish." And Mr. L. deliberately&#xD;
gathered them up, took them to the stove, and thrust&#xD;
them in. Requiescant in pace.&#xD;
Mrs. Sectary would have said this was sacrilege, at&#xD;
that time. But Mr. Lovegood did not intend that they&#xD;
should remain there, to disseminate Presbyterianism,&#xD;
and that under his own auspices. Now it never occur-&#xD;
red to Mr. Lovegood, that, as it was the season of&#xD;
spring, and the stove was not used, he had better apply&#xD;
a match to them. Ashes are safer than printed docu-&#xD;
ments. The library had been closed for several years;&#xD;
and no one knew what it contained, and a match would&#xD;
have put those tracts beyond the power of revivifica-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
On a balmy day, late in summer, some ladies visited&#xD;
the old church, to revive pleasant memories of "auld&#xD;
lang syne;" and a curious little child disentombed the&#xD;
old tracts and catechisms from the stove. Ah, Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood, you are to smart for this; it is certainly&#xD;
your work. We know it. "And what a sin! What&#xD;
a sacrilege ! Did you ever see or hear of the like ? All&#xD;
these blessed tracts intended to be burnt !"  "Who fur-&#xD;
nished them ?" "Mrs. Sectary; good Mrs. Sectary!"&#xD;
"0 , me ! ah, me !" and the ladies came near shedding&#xD;
tears over those tracts, that were so profuse in their&#xD;
abuse of the poor Church. As precious relics, the cher-&#xD;
ished tracts were gathered up, and borne in triumph to&#xD;
Mrs. Sectary.&#xD;
Now, reader, imagine the scene, if you can; and&#xD;
count the anathemas that fell on the head of the uncon-&#xD;
scious and unoffending young Rector, who simply de-&#xD;
sired to save the lambs of the fold from the sins of her-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
147&#xD;
&#xD;
esy.and schism; to save them from the poison of that&#xD;
tirade of abuse against the Mother of their love, con-&#xD;
tained in these very tracts. The news flew about on&#xD;
the wings of the wind. Poor tracts, ye came near the&#xD;
burning; ye were even threatened with martyrdom; ye&#xD;
made a narrow escape.&#xD;
It was a long time before Mr. Lovegood knew any&#xD;
thing about it. It appears that Mrs. Sectary, however,&#xD;
took his part, and saved him in his defencelessness, by&#xD;
saying that he had done right. "These tracts were&#xD;
against the principles and doctrines of his Church: she&#xD;
knew it, and she would do the same thing; she would&#xD;
burn, and had burnt, every Episcopal tract that she&#xD;
laid her hands upon, that taught any thing against&#xD;
Presbyterianism, and she did not see why he should&#xD;
not do the same thing." Bravo! Good for the young&#xD;
Rector. It saved him many a scathing reproof and bit-&#xD;
ter reproach. It satisfied most, but not all, the parish-&#xD;
ioners; and the matter was quieted. Still, Mrs. Sec-&#xD;
tary's opinion did not correspond with that of another&#xD;
Presbyterian lady, who thought it a high-handed meas-&#xD;
ure; rank Popery, and a development that should be&#xD;
nipped in the bud. And she vowed, that she would&#xD;
"see Mr. Nabob, and disclose the affair to him, and see&#xD;
if some official action could not be had, to rebuke the&#xD;
youthful David."&#xD;
Now, Mr. Nabob was a vestryman of the Church in&#xD;
lleartfulville, and deemed himself of considerable con-&#xD;
sequence; more, however, on account of his wealth,&#xD;
than any intrinsic cqualities of merit that he possessed.&#xD;
And it so happened, that Mr. Lovegood had, not long&#xD;
before, unwittingly offended the dignity of Mr. Nabob.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
It had been the practice, from time immemorial, for&#xD;
the congregation to remain in the church after service,&#xD;
as well as congregate there before service, to pass the&#xD;
civilities of the day, discuss the current gossip, talk&#xD;
about the weather, trade, the crops, etc.; and this, with&#xD;
all the freedom and hilarity of the highway or the mart&#xD;
of trade. This had annoyed Mr. Lovegood exceed-&#xD;
ingly; and he had taken various steps to put a stop to&#xD;
it, without success. On one occasion, about the period&#xD;
of which we are writing, discovering a great deal of&#xD;
loud and boisterous conversation after service, he re-&#xD;
quested an elderly gentleman, better known for the real&#xD;
goodness of his heart than for any pretensions to the&#xD;
suaviter in modo, to request the persons engaged in&#xD;
conversation to retire from the sanctuary. Mr. Love-&#xD;
good overheard only a few chance words: "House of&#xD;
God,-not the place for such conversation,-set apart,&#xD;
-sanctified,-out of doors the place." "Who sent you&#xD;
to me, Sir ?"  "Your Rector,-Rector,--.too much talk-&#xD;
ing,--too boisterous,-not Church-like !" It happened&#xD;
that the aforesaid old gentleman spoke to Mr. Nabob,&#xD;
and these chance words passed between the two.&#xD;
Now, Mr. Lovegood did not ask him to speak to any&#xD;
one in particular, and in his name, but simply supposed&#xD;
that he would make a suggestion, as he passed along ;&#xD;
and that his kindly suggestion, as he was a father in&#xD;
Israel, would be taken in the same spirit. But Mr.&#xD;
Nabob was highly offended; hence, when the aforesaid&#xD;
Presbyterian lady revealed to him the intended mar-&#xD;
tyrdom of the tracts, he seized upon it as a ground of&#xD;
assault upon Mr. Lovegood.&#xD;
"It was a high-handed measure," he said. " Their&#xD;
&#xD;
rights and liberties were invaded. It was an offence&#xD;
against law and order, and decency, and should be re-&#xD;
dressed." Accordingly, at the next meeting of the&#xD;
Vestry, Mr. Nabob brought a sweeping charge against&#xD;
the young Rector, for destroying, burning, or attempt-&#xD;
ing to burn, the books of the Church; books, too, that&#xD;
had been presented to the Sunday School by so eminent&#xD;
and pious a lady as Mrs. Sectary.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood recounted the whole affair, and -ex-&#xD;
plained the principles and motives by which he was&#xD;
actuated. The Vestry, quite unanimously, bore him&#xD;
out, and dismissed the matter, as one which they had&#xD;
no right to control. One of the body asked Mr. Nabob,&#xD;
if he supposed that a Presbyterian preacher would al-&#xD;
low our Catechism to be taught in his school? or tracts&#xD;
to be disseminated there, which were repugnant to&#xD;
Presbyterianism? This thought seemed to settle the&#xD;
question; and Mr. Lovegood rejoiced, that a new era&#xD;
was dawning upon his parish. He saw that his efforts&#xD;
thus far had been blessed, and that a sounder, healthier&#xD;
feeling began to pervade his parish. His Vestry would&#xD;
sustain him; which, six months before, they would not&#xD;
have done ; and this was to him a great comfort and&#xD;
encouragement.&#xD;
But Mr. Nabob was not satisfied ; and the story runs,&#xD;
that he consulted an eminent lawyer, in a neighboring&#xD;
town, to ascertain whether Mr. Lovegood could not be&#xD;
prosecuted for his high-handed offence. The lawyer&#xD;
laughed at him; and he returned home to annoy the&#xD;
young Rector in other ways, and through other means.&#xD;
For four or five years, he continued a system of petty&#xD;
annoyances. Yet the Rector lived through it all; lived&#xD;

DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
down his opposition, and lived to see the day that Mr.&#xD;
Nabob cherished him as warmly as any of his parish-&#xD;
ioners.&#xD;
We need not pause, to recount the thousand and one&#xD;
ups and downs, and petty annoyances, through which&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was called to pass. We have detailed&#xD;
so much, merely in support of our postulate, that no&#xD;
clergyman is free from trouble ; that, however pleasant&#xD;
the lines of life may appear to be to the casual observer,&#xD;
sin will arise in its strength, and there will be found&#xD;
causes of dissension, and opposition, and strife, to fill&#xD;
the pastoral heart with grief and anxiety. And now,&#xD;
after many buffetings and privations, after long years&#xD;
of toil, Mr. Lovegood, having breasted the waves of&#xD;
ignorance and prejudice, finds himself, at the period&#xD;
we are introduced to him, in a united parish, and&#xD;
among an affectionate people, who understand and ap-&#xD;
preciate the Church, and love him very tenderly, as a&#xD;
man, and for his work's sake.&#xD;
It was therefore not without pain, that he brought&#xD;
himself to think of accepting the call to St.  's&#xD;
Church; and yet, the more he thought of it, the more&#xD;
did he feel disposed to accept it. But when he reflect-&#xD;
ed on the number of years that he had ministered to&#xD;
his present flock, the troubles through which he had&#xD;
passed,-and, strange as it may appear, it is neverthe-&#xD;
less true, troubles, afflictions, heart-griefs, do attach us&#xD;
to the places in which, or the people among whom, we&#xD;
have endured them,-the yearning love that he bore, to&#xD;
his flock, and the esteem and veneration in which they&#xD;
held him,--when he looked out upon his flowers, and&#xD;
heard the familiar voices of the wrens, and the mock-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing-birds, his daily companions, about his quiet study,&#xD;
-above all, when he considered the sacredness of the&#xD;
pastoral tie, now strengthened by the joys and sorrows&#xD;
of years, his heart almost died within him, and he&#xD;
groaned aloud in his spirit. But so it was, he felt&#xD;
calledaof God.&#xD;
Of this impression he could not divest himself. He&#xD;
prayed for grace and guidance. ' In his full, ripe man-&#xD;
hood, he wept like a child. But the hand of the Lord&#xD;
was upon him. He could not draw back. He must&#xD;
leave these pleasant scenes; and other hands must feed&#xD;
his loving flock; other ears greet the melody of his&#xD;
singing-birds; another's heart be lifted up in prayer&#xD;
and praise in that goodly old sanctuary; another's&#xD;
voice bless the people whom the Lord had given him&#xD;
in his youth. The deed was done; and all eyes gushed&#xD;
out in tears; all hearts throbbed in grief.&#xD;
Ah, the pastoral tie ! few know how close, how dear&#xD;
it is. We indeed see, day by day, that it seems lightly&#xD;
severed. But ahi! the records of the Great Day alone&#xD;
will reveal all secrets. Deal gently with thy brother.&#xD;
Poverty and a hard struggle, the wants of a little fam-&#xD;
ily, that have mouths to be fed and bodies tq be cloth-&#xD;
ed,-a slender pittance,-these are, after al, the great&#xD;
secret; a secret that contains more than we care to&#xD;
dwell upon. But this consideration weighed not with&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood. We merely throw out the remark, in&#xD;
passing. He acted upon convictions of duty. None&#xD;
condemned him. His parishioners, while bathed in&#xD;
tears, conceded that it was his duty to accept the call.&#xD;
Ah, the world is full of change ! There is nothing&#xD;
certain here; nothing for man to fasten his thoughts&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
A DASH OF PRETENCE. PAROCHIAL TROUBLES. MR. LOVE-&#xD;
GOOD S FIRST SERMON IN ST. Is.&#xD;
THE Blemmertons were among the first to greet Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood on his entering upon his new duties. "They&#xD;
rejoiced that he had accepted the call, and that the&#xD;
Church had been so fortunate as to secure the services&#xD;
of so eminent a man." Mr. Blemmerton, especially,&#xD;
feared, from the tone of Mr. Lovegood's letter to him,&#xD;
that lie could not be induced to leave lleartfulville.&#xD;
"And yet," said he, "I was not without hope, that you&#xD;
would embrace the opportunity of leaving the scene of&#xD;
so many trials.. I have for years been conversant with&#xD;
the state of things in your parish; and I know that you&#xD;
have had a great deal to contend with ; and truly re-&#xD;
joice that at last you are free."&#xD;
Now Mr. B. had of late picked up an old story or&#xD;
two,'which had for years been forgotten or become ob-&#xD;
solete ; but they were fresh to him, and important items&#xD;
in the catalogue of his notes. A few of them he wished&#xD;
to canvass, by way of sounding Mr. Lovegood's theo-&#xD;
logical tendencies. But he was not fast enough for&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton ; who, taking up his observation, re-&#xD;
marked: "Is it true, Mr. Lovegood, that Mr. Flunks,&#xD;
one of your Vestrymen, gave Dr. Thrasher, the Meth-&#xD;
odist preacher, permission, in your absence, to preach&#xD;
a funeral sermon in your church ?"    "I believe,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             155&#xD;
Madam, that such a thing occurred a number of years&#xD;
ago ; but it has been so long, that the particulars have&#xD;
escaped my memory." "Well, we heard it, and thought&#xD;
it very strange. We heard, moreover, that the Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Churchman wasofficiating for you, and was in the&#xD;
pulpit when the funeral cortege arrived at the church,&#xD;
and that Dr. Thrasher was highly indignant that he did&#xD;
not descend from the pulpit at once, and give place to&#xD;
him; that, moreover, he made a great many ill-natured&#xD;
remarks, alleging, among other things, that the great-&#xD;
grandfather of the deceased had contributed towards&#xD;
the building of that church, and it was exceedingly&#xD;
uncharitable to prohibit his descendant from having a&#xD;
funeral sermon preached over her remains from that&#xD;
pulpit."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was indisposed to converse on such a&#xD;
topic. He said that something of the kind had occur-&#xD;
red years ago ; but he took no part in it, except to con-&#xD;
demn Mr. Flunks, for granting so extraordinary a privi-&#xD;
lege. He believed, moreover, that a sharp controversy.&#xD;
had been carried on between the aforesaid Dr. Thrasher&#xD;
and others, about the rights of Methodists and others,&#xD;
to the use of our churches and churchyards for their&#xD;
rites of sepulture and funeral sermons, on the score&#xD;
that their forefathers had been members of the Church,&#xD;
and had aided in building the church in Heartfulville.&#xD;
But he was happy to state, that the Church was better&#xD;
understood in Heartfulville than at that day, and all&#xD;
tuch disputations and contentions had subsided a num-&#xD;
ber of years ago.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Blemmerton thought it a strange affair !&#xD;
But the world is full of strange events and adventures.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'&#xD;

&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
A thing called Puseyism had of late sprung up, that&#xD;
troubled them not a little ; and they wondered whether&#xD;
it extended as far back as to the date of that old quar-&#xD;
rel in Heartfulville. They hoped to have the pleasure&#xD;
of hearing Mr. Lovegood preach as their pastor, on the&#xD;
next Sunday. They had no doubt they should be&#xD;
highly pleased and edified. Expressing a strong desire&#xD;
that Mr. Lovegood would visit them often, and make&#xD;
himself entirely at home at their house, they took their&#xD;
departure.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood entered on his official duties, on the&#xD;
following Sunday;. and, as his sermon was published at&#xD;
the time, we give it to the reader. It was entitled,&#xD;
" The Pastoral Call and Duty," from the text,, Acts x.&#xD;
29 : " Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying,&#xD;
as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what in-&#xD;
tent ye have sent for me."&#xD;
Love is the primary principle and motive of the&#xD;
Gospel. God loved us, and sent His Son into the world&#xD;
to redeem us, and to instruct us, by a revelation of His&#xD;
will, through which He hath "brought life and immor-&#xD;
tality to light." And it pleased the Son, in revealing&#xD;
this will to us, to found, in His love, a Kingdom, which&#xD;
He termed His Spouse, His Body, His Church, "the&#xD;
fulness of Him that filleth all in all," in and through&#xD;
which He manifests His mercy to the race of Adam&#xD;
fallen, having sanctified it by His own blood, and holi-&#xD;
ness, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost, by Him sent to&#xD;
be the Sanctifier of the ways of Sion, and of the means&#xD;
of grace, instituted by Himself for the world's healing,&#xD;
and for our calling, election, and sealing, unto the day&#xD;
when we shall be gathered into glory.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
157&#xD;
&#xD;
Hence the Gospel, taken in all its parts, is a system&#xD;
of instrumentalities and agencies, every one of which&#xD;
centres in love. The Bible, the Church, the Christian&#xD;
Priesthood, the Holy Sacraients,--the one to com-&#xD;
mence life, the other to carry it on,-and prayer and&#xD;
praise, and Confirmation, and the employments of the&#xD;
Sanctuary : these all are so many means of grace,&#xD;
channels of mercy, through which the Lord vouchsafes&#xD;
to us His blessings. Conspicuous among all these&#xD;
means of grace and instrumentalities of the Lord's&#xD;
vouchsafement, stands the "ministry of reconciliation."&#xD;
Earthen vessels, indeed, they are, yet hath it pleased&#xD;
the Lord to grant and appoint, that through their min-&#xD;
istrations mankind should, be admitted into the folds&#xD;
of the Church, and taught the way of righteousness,&#xD;
that they might have a right unto the "Tree of Life,"&#xD;
whose fruits possess an immortal virtue.&#xD;
Such an instrument in the Lord's hands was the Apos-&#xD;
tle Peter. Such instruments are all, at the present day,&#xD;
in their several lots, who fill a part in the same Chris-&#xD;
tian Priesthood, whether they be Bishops, Priests, or&#xD;
Deacons.&#xD;
A heathen, who had loved righteousness and sought&#xD;
the light with all his heart, by earnest devotion, and&#xD;
from whose darkened mind it had pleased the Lord to&#xD;
lift the veil that shut out the sunlight of His will, was&#xD;
directed what to do, in order that he and his family&#xD;
might be saved. "Thy prayers and thine alms are&#xD;
come up for a memorial before God. And now send&#xD;
men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname&#xD;
is Peter: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do."&#xD;
Comnelius was obedient to the heavenly vision, and sent&#xD;

for the Apostle, who, when he arrived, as a man intent&#xD;
on his mission, full of a sense of duty, burning with a&#xD;
love of souls, and with zeal for the cause of his Master,&#xD;
proceeded at once to the subject-matter in hand. Act-&#xD;
ing for God, acting for man, in the absorbing question&#xD;
of salvation ; holding an embassy from the King of&#xD;
Heaven : these are awful trusts, tremendous responsi-&#xD;
bilities, requiring a prompt decision, immediate hear-&#xD;
ing, resolute prosecution.&#xD;
Therefore, the Apostle delayed not to enter upon his&#xD;
work. " Ye have called me unto you," lie said ; "I&#xD;
have obeyed the call without delay, without question-&#xD;
ing, as soon as I was sent for : I ask, therefore, for what&#xD;
intent ye have sent for me&#xD;
The motive of Cornelius was, that he might learn&#xD;
what he ought to do, in order to salvation. Doubt-&#xD;
less yours was the same. And with Cornelius you are&#xD;
ready to exclaim: "Thou hast well done that thou&#xD;
art come. Now therefore are we all here present&#xD;
before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee&#xD;
of God."&#xD;
The light of the glorious Gospel bath penetrated&#xD;
every hamlet, town, and village in this great land. It&#xD;
beams around you, and shines out unto 'you, from the&#xD;
pages of Divine Revelation. It is not then, so much&#xD;
that you need to be told, like Cornelius what you must&#xD;
do to be saved, but how you must do it. Your want&#xD;
was that of the kindly pastoral office ; not simply to&#xD;
instruct, but also to guide and counsel, to throw the&#xD;
loving arm around the little ones, to go in and out&#xD;
among you, carrying the words of love, and life, and&#xD;
consolation; now cheering you in well-doing; then&#xD;

solacing in sorrow; mingling together sunshine and&#xD;
tears, and so building you up in soundness of faith and&#xD;
holiness of heart, " till we all come in the unity of the&#xD;
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a&#xD;
perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the ful-&#xD;
ness of Christ."&#xD;
You are not to hear, for the first time, that "Faith&#xD;
cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God ;"&#xD;
nor, " How shall they call on Him in whom they have&#xD;
not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of&#xD;
whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear&#xD;
without a preacher?  And how shall they preach&#xD;
except they be'sent ?" You are not to be told for the&#xD;
first time of Christ crucified ; of the awful doctrines of&#xD;
the Incarnation and Atonement; of Justification by&#xD;
Faith, which kills us to sin and dead works, and makes&#xD;
alive unto the law of good works in Christ; of Baptism&#xD;
and the Supper of the Lord; of the Church and Min-&#xD;
istry: all united in one, comprising the Word, the&#xD;
Faith, the Ministry and Sacraments, the visible King-&#xD;
dom of Christ on earth, with its invisible powers, and&#xD;
graces, and helps, set forth in the world for man's sal-&#xD;
vation: in short, all the primary facts of the Gospel&#xD;
revelation. These are not for the first time to break&#xD;
upon your ears, or enkindle your hearts to songs of&#xD;
praise and thanksgiving ; for, in them is found the&#xD;
motive that prompted you to send for us. It was the&#xD;
love of Christ constraining you. You had faith in His&#xD;
word and ordinances. You believed, that He had&#xD;
appointed an order of men in His Church, and given&#xD;
them commission to "go into all the world, and preach&#xD;
the Gospel unto every creature, baptizing them in the&#xD;

&#xD;
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy&#xD;
Ghost," and that He would be with them unto the&#xD;
world's end.  .&#xD;
These all are Gospel motives, wise, holy, good, and&#xD;
just. We trust that you have felt them, that you&#xD;
have thought upon them, prayed over them, in the&#xD;
silent watches of the night, in the routine of daily&#xD;
life; that you have weighed them in all their bear-&#xD;
ings upon the soul's destiny, and been fully actuated by&#xD;
them.&#xD;
But there are a few mistakes, to which we all are&#xD;
liable, on this and kindred topics, against which you&#xD;
may well be guarded. A consideration of these will&#xD;
open to your reflection some thoughts on what you&#xD;
have not a right to expect of us, and what you have.&#xD;
1. You should not expect of us a half-way, one-sided&#xD;
statement of Gospel truth ; but to preach Christ, in all&#xD;
His fulness, as the Rock of our salvation, as He imparts&#xD;
Himself to us, in and through the word and ordinances&#xD;
of the Church: this you have a right to expect. The&#xD;
proclamation of God's love to man, which is written in&#xD;
the heights and depths, on things visible and invisible,&#xD;
from the worlds on high, to the tiny flower that blooms&#xD;
at our feet ; and which, from the Incarnation and Cross,&#xD;
burst out in a flood of light and glory that embalmed&#xD;
the world, consummated the yearnings and heart-&#xD;
breathings of the race of fallen Adam, and filled the&#xD;
measure of type and prophecy, and earth and heaven&#xD;
with rejoicings: this great proclamation, we say, is all&#xD;
too pure, too holy, too wonderful and excellent, to be&#xD;
divided, or frittered away into shreds and tattered rem-&#xD;
nants. But, to fill the measure of our needs and long-&#xD;

ings, it is to be presented and received as a whole,&#xD;
compacted and knit together, beautiful in its oneness,&#xD;
beautiful in its love and order, transcendently beautiful&#xD;
in its sanctification.&#xD;
2. Nor can you expect us to be a mere man-pleaser ;&#xD;
a mere supplant for your favor and good opinion, at&#xD;
the hazard of your souls' eternal weal. This would&#xD;
debase us below the dignity of man, not to say of our&#xD;
office. But, to please men in things lawful, is no less&#xD;
the duty of Christ's ambassador, than of all other men.&#xD;
And this, we take it, is St. Paul's meaning, when he&#xD;
speaks of becoming all things to all men. He certainly&#xD;
did not mean, that he wore a mask, and that his life was&#xD;
merely a drama of hypocritical masquerading; nay, but&#xD;
that he adapted himself, in things lawful, to the predi-&#xD;
lections of his fellow-men. But in things unlawful, he&#xD;
yielded,-no, not one jot nor tittle ; but stood as a&#xD;
"beaten anvil." He drew around him the great gar-&#xD;
inent of holiness, in which he was clad. Nothing in-&#xD;
tervened between him and duty to the cause he had&#xD;
espoused. Hence, to please men in things lawful is a&#xD;
duty, springing out of the Gospel, and its sanctifying&#xD;
civilization.&#xD;
To -be complaisant, amiable, gentle, easily entreated,&#xD;
ready to forgive, kindly and genial unto all orders and&#xD;
degrees of men, are beautiful and becoming traits in&#xD;
the character of the Christian gentleman. But to be&#xD;
truckling, time-serving, and shrinking, to proclaim&#xD;
simply "smooth things," to dally with the sins and sin-&#xD;
fulness of men, publish a half-way Gospel, cry peace,&#xD;
when there is no peace; to insist on a moderate, medium&#xD;
piety, and strictness of life, that dare not lift their head&#xD;

162    THE RLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
above the world's skeleton standard of morality; to be&#xD;
merely a fashionable, fastidious, sentimental, dandyizing&#xD;
proclaimer of the Divine Word, dealing in the beauties&#xD;
of rhetoric and flowing graces of poesy, beating the air,'&#xD;
and merely generalizing on the chief topics of Gospel&#xD;
truth : ah, let it never be named, as becoming the office&#xD;
of him who speaks with Christ's authority, and the&#xD;
sanctity of the temple where the Lord hath set His&#xD;
name, and where He will be sanctified and glorified in&#xD;
all who come nigh to Him.&#xD;
3. Every community has its peculiarities, or what&#xD;
may be termed its peculiar phases or traits of sim, in&#xD;
short-comings, in works, or in words. Man is, indeed,,&#xD;
a sinner, and alike in sinfulness the world over. But&#xD;
what we mean is, that in every community, among&#xD;
every people, there will be found some peculiar type of&#xD;
failing, of sinfulness, in doing or not doing, in positives&#xD;
or negatives, over and above every other type, amount-&#xD;
ing' to a characteristic. It may spring out of settled&#xD;
habit, or fashion, or neglect, until from usage it has&#xD;
grown popular, and so is lost sight of, in the general&#xD;
whirl of the excitements of business, or pleasure, or&#xD;
amusement. Still it is there; it exists, crippling our&#xD;
energies in the Christian life, and dwarfing us in spirit-&#xD;
uality.  And ever and anon it springs out from  its&#xD;
hiding-place, and is seen and felt, as it sows sorrow, and&#xD;
draws tears after it in its wake.&#xD;
Against whatever short-comings of this character&#xD;
may be peculiar among you, you will surely need to be&#xD;
warned and guarded. For they are of a very insidious&#xD;
character ; slow, stealthy, secret in their approaches and&#xD;
insinuations, but inevitable in their disastrous results, if&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGs BY THE WAYSIDE.             163&#xD;
they are left to canker in the heart, or prey upon the&#xD;
vitals of our spiritual life. These are, indeed, the&#xD;
thieves of our spiritual existence and growth ; the small&#xD;
commonplace, trifling sins, as some are pleased to term&#xD;
them; such as hasty anger, and cursing, pride, and&#xD;
emulation, and bitterness of feeling, and strife, and&#xD;
tattling, and scandal, overweening regard to the world's&#xD;
fashions and pastimes, conventional formalities, and the&#xD;
like. These, we say, are like the thief unto the flock at&#xD;
night, and steal away our spiritual life and' strength,&#xD;
while we are asleep or dallying with our dreams.&#xD;
On all these topics you may not expect us to speak&#xD;
in uncertain language, or deal in vague and dubious&#xD;
generalities. If we are to combat with the world, the&#xD;
flesh, and the devil; if these are the foes over whom we&#xD;
are to triumph, winning the crown of immortal glory,&#xD;
or bearing off spoils of priceless value ; then it must&#xD;
needs be, that we strike home blows on -solid matter,&#xD;
and that we stand in our lot,girded about with faith,&#xD;
"looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our&#xD;
faith, Who, for the joy that was set before Him,&#xD;
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down&#xD;
at the right hand of the throne of God."&#xD;
4. Nor should you expect us to assume merely the&#xD;
Shibboleth of party, in our teachings or counsels. From&#xD;
the days of the Apostles, indeed, there have been&#xD;
sharpnesses and conflicts in the Church, and differences&#xD;
in opinion, and shades of opinion, sometimes on ques-&#xD;
tions indifferent, more frequently on such as are serious&#xD;
and fundamental, lying at the very foundations of the&#xD;
faith. But the faith has been kept intact, and has been&#xD;
transmitted to us. And an age of disquietude and agi-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7334-00000083"/>&#xD;
164     THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
tation in the Church is not, necessarily, an age of&#xD;
unsoundness. Nay, it may be, and doubtless for the&#xD;
most part is, a more pregnant sign of life. To this&#xD;
truth the medieval ages witness. It was at no tempest-&#xD;
tossed epoch of the Church, that the truth was over-&#xD;
laid or smothered with error, (in any branch of the&#xD;
Church,) but when she was freest from agitation, when&#xD;
she was lulled into repose. What has been true of the&#xD;
great empires that have flourished, and died out, has&#xD;
also, in degree, been found true of the Church. Rome,&#xD;
for instance, was not shattered and laid in the dust,&#xD;
while "her conquering arms shook the world ;" but&#xD;
when she became luxurious, easy, careless; when she&#xD;
wrapped herself in her fancied greatness, and fell asleep,&#xD;
dreaming over her glories and security. Then it was,&#xD;
that her well-springs were sapped, and she burst asun-&#xD;
der, and died out, leaving but the glimmering light of&#xD;
a meteor across the hemisphere of her greatness.&#xD;
It is true, the analogy cannot hold in all its parts;&#xD;
for the Church has an undying life. She may suffer&#xD;
from ease or indifference, or fancied security ; she may&#xD;
suffer from false doctrine, or from needless agitation;&#xD;
she may suffer for want of agitation and trial, to draw&#xD;
out and develop her powers; or she may be torn by&#xD;
fierce conflicts, even unto martyrdom; but she has&#xD;
recuperative powers. She cannot die out, she must&#xD;
survive all shocks. The Lord rules her, and in her;&#xD;
and against her the gates of hell can never prevail.&#xD;
While, therefore, we would eschew controversy, for&#xD;
the sake of controversy, we are far from thinking it&#xD;
always an evil. Like any other good, it is good in its&#xD;
place, and bad out of it. By it, truth is elicited and&#xD;
&#xD;
eliminated; and we are built up in soundness of faith&#xD;
and knowledge. On the other hand, when it is prose-&#xD;
cuted with acrimony, in an unchastened, unloving&#xD;
spirit, it is an evil; and is to be guarded against, with&#xD;
a jealous care and watchfulness. But controversy for&#xD;
truth's sake, and partizanship in the Church, are quite&#xD;
distinct; not, indeed, always in practice, but certainly&#xD;
always in theory. The one, when pursued in a right&#xD;
spirit, leads to conviction of the truth, to enlight-&#xD;
enment ; the other simply tends to draw a film over the&#xD;
mental eye, and to close it in blindness. The one has&#xD;
watered the Church, as with the dews of heaven, from&#xD;
the days of our Lord and His Apostles, who were the&#xD;
greatest champions in controversy for the truth that the&#xD;
Church or the world 'ever beheld, and out of whose&#xD;
loving contentions with false doctrine have sprung as&#xD;
many disciples and saints as the stars of heaven in&#xD;
number, who have glorified God in their lives, and do&#xD;
now rest in Paradise. The other has crossed the heart,&#xD;
warped and blighted the natural affections, done despite&#xD;
to the Spirit of grace and glory, taught one to say, "I&#xD;
am of Paul," another, "I am of Apollos," until the&#xD;
robe of Christ is rent, and the enemy of souls revels in&#xD;
his hiding-place ; and his hoarse laugh, in solemn&#xD;
mockery, rings through the.earth.&#xD;
While, then, we shall not disregard the great ques-&#xD;
tions of the day, nor close our eyes against the fact, that&#xD;
this is a self-sufficient age ; that there is a radical spirit&#xD;
abroad, which threatens the very citadel of our hopes,&#xD;
and which, in its rationalizing unbelief, would tear the&#xD;
diadem from the brow of Jesus of Nazareth, reeking&#xD;
afresh with gore, and tramplethe volume of revealed&#xD;

166     THE BLEMMEETONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Truth in the dust ; you may not expect us, in our teach-&#xD;
ings of the great facts of Christianity, the doctrines of&#xD;
the faith revealed from heaven, for man's salvation, to&#xD;
assume any mere party badge or dictum. But, rais-&#xD;
ing the standard of the Cross high above every aim,&#xD;
every wish, but that which centres in a love of Christ&#xD;
and the Church, as that Cross is revealed in Holy Writ,&#xD;
and amplified in all the.teachings of the Church, in her&#xD;
Prayer-Book, Articles, Offices, and Homilies; in their&#xD;
plain, common sense, unvarnished letter and spirit, aid,&#xD;
ed thereunto by the light of the early day of the Gospel,&#xD;
which comes to us through those worthies of old, the&#xD;
Christian Fathers, a "long and glittering line," who,&#xD;
through tribulation and travail, and stripes, and watch-&#xD;
ings, and prayers, and self-denials, preserved the faith&#xD;
pure and unmixed with aught of error, and transmitted&#xD;
it to us : this shall be our aim. More than this we&#xD;
cannot promise ; neither more nor less than this can&#xD;
you expect : this, by the Lord's help, we will fulfil..&#xD;
The day for disputing on questions of mere opinion&#xD;
has passed away. Other and weightier matters demand&#xD;
our consideration. The Church has entered on a new&#xD;
era ; an era,; it is true, of strife, brought about, as is&#xD;
most usual, by a pressure from without. We have a&#xD;
mighty foe to meet and combat, who, though lurking in&#xD;
secret places for long years, has yet been gathering&#xD;
strength and maturing plans. His banner is now un-&#xD;
furled. His legions are in the field: we are already in&#xD;
the strife, and are called to press our armor close about&#xD;
us, and to draw our weapons, well-pointed, and with&#xD;
certain aim.&#xD;
This foe is Infidelity ; not simply practical unbelief,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.              167&#xD;
but bold, defiant Deism, which strikes at the citadel;&#xD;
which, as a vampire, would suck out the life of our&#xD;
most holy faith, would wrest from man the rich heritage&#xD;
of the glorious Gospel of Christ, and leave him a wreck,&#xD;
without chart or compass, to be thrust out on the wide&#xD;
ocean of eternity, without cheer and without hope.&#xD;
This is our great work : it is a powerful pressure from&#xD;
without, consolidating our strength and powers, shut-&#xD;
ting our eyes against every question of minor considera-&#xD;
tion. The time has come, when we must stand by our&#xD;
first principles, as watchmen on the walls of Sion, giv-&#xD;
ing warning of danger, and calling the faithful and&#xD;
valiant unto the Lord's battle. Unto this work, then,&#xD;
are we called. And from him that shall be true shall&#xD;
no good thing be withholden ; to him that overconieth&#xD;
shall be given to eat of " the Tree of Life."  No effort&#xD;
of ours, however small, no labor of love or self-denial,&#xD;
no fierce conflict with the enemy, no deed of charity or&#xD;
Sympathy, no crucifying of the flesh and the spirit, shall&#xD;
ever be forgotten of our Heavenly Father. The Lord&#xD;
will write up the history at the last, and "from the&#xD;
open volume of the Book of Life," and in "the full&#xD;
blaze of the Judgment Day," will He crown us for all&#xD;
we do, or suffer, or endure, in this great conflict for His&#xD;
Name's sake.&#xD;
You do not like that sermon. The chronicler cannot&#xD;
help it. His duty is merely to record facts. He has&#xD;

fore him. If you are not pleased, he merely regrets it.&#xD;
It is a matter-of-fact production, from a matter-of-fact&#xD;
man; and, for aught that I know, teaches wholesome&#xD;
truths in a straight-forward way. Mr. Lovegood always&#xD;
preached to his parishioners; not to mankind in gene-&#xD;
ral. And his parishioners rarely mistook his meaning.&#xD;
His style was not to address the world ; saying " they"&#xD;
did so and so, or "they" were wrong in this or that ;&#xD;
but "you," the veritable people before him, "you" are&#xD;
wrong in this or that,-" you" do so and so.&#xD;
There is, we opine, too much of this generalizing ;&#xD;
too little of distinct, plain, straight-forward teaching,&#xD;
whether of the distinctive doctrines of the Church, or&#xD;
the practical duties of the Christian life. If we wish to&#xD;
convince our congregations of the sin of worldliness, or&#xD;
mammon-worship, or sins of the tongue, or niggardli-&#xD;
ness in supporting the Church, why not tell them so at&#xD;
once, point their sin distinctly out to them, make them&#xD;
feel that we are preaching to them, and not at sins as&#xD;
they prevail in the world? "They" do so and so, and&#xD;
"the world" does so and so, and "the world" does very&#xD;
wrong, or "they" do very wickedly. This is all very&#xD;
well, perchance; and our congregations will accord&#xD;
that "they" and "the world" are very bad; and they&#xD;
will be not a whit better. It is all indefinite; it has an&#xD;
unreal, impracticable sound. This is a practical age;&#xD;
and mankind need to be met on their own grounds. If&#xD;
you wish them to take what you say, to themselves per-&#xD;
sonally, you must apply it. Men have not time to do&#xD;
this for themselves.&#xD;
Still you do not like that sermon; nor did Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton, nor Mrs. Fussy, nor Mrs. Nochurch,&#xD;

&#xD;
nor Mrs. Fastidious, nor "the rest" of them, to use&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton's language. But, perhaps they object-&#xD;
ed to it, for a different reason. It is impossible to sat-&#xD;
isfy all tastes in such a matter. Perhaps, had it been&#xD;
more agreeable to your wishes, to them it would have&#xD;
been still more unsatisfactory; or had it pleased you&#xD;
less, it would have been to them perfection itself.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE GRANTNERS. REVELATION. FAMILY TRIALS.&#xD;
BATr, situated in Somersetshire, England, about a&#xD;
hundred and ten miles west of London, in a beautiful&#xD;
valley, through which sweeps the river Avon, is said to&#xD;
be the best built town, and one of the most attractive&#xD;
in our mother-land. It is a town of antiquity, but be-&#xD;
cam&amp;amp; important, in comparatively modern times, on ac-&#xD;
count of its mineral springs. And for many years it&#xD;
has been a noted summer resort, and the permanent&#xD;
residence of numbers of the wealthy and higher classes.&#xD;
Here, in days gone by, dwelt Richard and Jane&#xD;
Grantner. Richard Grantner had been a prosper'ous&#xD;
merchant in London, and a man of prominence in the&#xD;
commercial enterprises of that great city; but; having&#xD;
amassed a large property, he retired from business, and&#xD;
selected the beautiful town of Lath, as the home of his&#xD;
declining days. Devoted members of the Church of&#xD;
England, living for the good of man and the glory of&#xD;
God, this pious couple descended to the tomb, leaving&#xD;
after them a memory which yet lives, in the traditions&#xD;
that have come down from their day ; and the genera-&#xD;
tions that succeeded them yet rise up and call them&#xD;
blessed.&#xD;
In a fast age, forty or fifty years seem a long time for&#xD;
"the memory of the just to be blessed." Ah, how soon&#xD;
are the pious, the holy, forgotten! Even the tombs that&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             171&#xD;
contain their sacred dust, the consecrated ground that&#xD;
holds their ashes, how are they rudely assaulted, or&#xD;
desecrated by the grasping hand of this money-seeking,&#xD;
mammon-worshipping age ! There is no time to dwell&#xD;
on the past. The past is slow. Throw over the mantle&#xD;
of obliviousness, sound the whistle, ring the bell, give&#xD;
us steam, we must away,-away! There is no time for&#xD;
rest, for reflection, for meditation ; no time to look -up&#xD;
towards eternity, to count the sands of life, as one by&#xD;
one they drop from our hour-glass. No: no time. Talk&#xD;
to us about the present; the past is obsolete, the future&#xD;
is in the womb. They present, that is ours; ours for&#xD;
gain, for pleasure, for excitement, for gold. Give us&#xD;
gold, or -we die. Ah, we live in an earnest age about&#xD;
every thing of time; but, alas! we are not in earnest&#xD;
about eternity. We want the spirit of the nobleman&#xD;
who, from the depths of his soul, cried out, "Sir, come&#xD;
down ere my child die."  John iv. 49. Here we see&#xD;
the real man's heart, not in any half-way work, but&#xD;
wlhole-souled, gushing and running out in deed and in&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
And is it not ever so with man, when he undertakes&#xD;
a work that he intends to accomplish? IRun your eye&#xD;
through all the avenues of life, and see if you cannot&#xD;
point out the men who are going to succeed in their&#xD;
undertakings ; and who are they but your earnest men?&#xD;
They who lay their shoulders to the burden, who go to&#xD;
work with spirit, and help themselves along by their&#xD;
own indomitable efforts? All men are ready to help&#xD;
them who help themselves. But take a mere drone;&#xD;
one who trifles, dilly-dallies with his work, goes at it&#xD;
half asleep, half awake ; who moves along as though&#xD;

he aimed at nothing, expected to accomplish no-&#xD;
thing ; and what is he set down to be worth? Just&#xD;
nothing. He is accounted a trifler. No one is will-&#xD;
ing to incur the risk, of helping him.  There is no&#xD;
time for experiments. He has no credit in the world.&#xD;
His note in the money market is no better than a piece&#xD;
of blank paper. It is so the world over. Men have&#xD;
keen sharp eyes everywhere, and a mere trifler is&#xD;
worth nothing. He is of less account in this fast age,&#xD;
than the airy bubble which the boy blows from his pipe,&#xD;
and which dances awhile in the air, reflecting the sun-&#xD;
light, and then bursts asunder and is gone; for that af-&#xD;
fords some childish pastime and amusement. But, a&#xD;
mere trifler cannot lay claim even to that.&#xD;
This you say, is true. And yet we see not that we&#xD;
need the same deep earnestness in spiritual things. We&#xD;
are dying, and our sons and our daughters are dying. The&#xD;
plague is rife among us. We must arouse from our&#xD;
pleasing dreams. Our perishing souls must be held up&#xD;
before us, sickening and dying for the healing medi-&#xD;
cine which Christ alone can give, and which He hath&#xD;
commissioned His Church to dispense. But, alas ! we&#xD;
will not have it; we will not cry out for it. And yet&#xD;
the day of the Lord cometh ; the night is approaching,&#xD;
in which no work may be done. The Apostle hath&#xD;
written, "For that day shall not come, except there&#xD;
come a falling away first." 2 Thess. ii. 3.&#xD;
Ah, this is an awful prophecy; and how is it fulfil-&#xD;
ling at the present day! What a lamentable departure&#xD;
do we behold from the faith, as with one heart and&#xD;
mouth it was held and professed in the early Church!&#xD;
And 0, how sadly have men, called Christian, become&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGs BY THE WAYSIDE.              173&#xD;
lovers of themselves rather than of God! Some deny the&#xD;
divinity of the Son of God; some, the Sacraments of&#xD;
His appointment ; some, the unity of the Church;&#xD;
some, the endless punishment of the wicked, forgetting&#xD;
that in the nature of the case, the character formed in&#xD;
this life must endure forever. Some reject all myste-&#xD;
ries; others cannot have mysteries enough without&#xD;
manufacturing them. Some have itching ears, and run&#xD;
after the fables of heresy and schism. Some profess&#xD;
without practice. Is it a word of theory ? How many&#xD;
listen to it gladly ! Is it a word of correction and re-&#xD;
proof? How many turn away from it and harden their&#xD;
hearts! Give us smooth things, they say ; delectable&#xD;
diet for the mind. Let us not hear of the rigors of re-&#xD;
pentance, or strictness of life, or soundness in the faith.&#xD;
Every man must go to heaven in his, own way. Do&#xD;
not all men act so in the things of this life? Would&#xD;
you tie every man to your notions ? No: we will be&#xD;
free. Give us not teaching ; but tickle our fancies. We&#xD;
have not time for prosy dogmatizing ; it is too slow for&#xD;
us.  Give us pretty prayers, and pretty preaching.&#xD;
Abuse sin as much as you choose ; but let us alone. It&#xD;
is not applicable to us. Let us dream  on, sleep on;&#xD;
our dreaming is sweet ; our sleepis glorious. Sound&#xD;
not in our ears that terrible sentence, "Awake, thou&#xD;
that steepest !" And so, as the Apostle foretold, there&#xD;
is a falling away.&#xD;
The world called Christian is rocked in a cradle of&#xD;
ease, and, like a sleeping infant, is fretful when:it is&#xD;
aroused. Let us sleep on, rock on. Sing to us a lullaby.&#xD;
Give us soft music and gentle whispers. But the blast&#xD;
of the trumpet will come, and that lullaby will be over;&#xD;

the dream, past and gone. "Awake, thou that sleep-&#xD;
est, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee&#xD;
light." " The night is far spent, the day is at hand."&#xD;
Richard and Jane Grantner had but two children, a&#xD;
son and a daughter, who succeeded to the fortune of'&#xD;
the father. Mary Grantner, at the death of her father,&#xD;
who outlived his wife but a few years, was a sprightly&#xD;
flaxen-haired  irl of ten years of age. Her brother&#xD;
Richard was her senior by twelve years. On the death&#xD;
of the father, the management of his estate devolved on&#xD;
Richard, who was also by the father's will the guardian&#xD;
of his sister, Mary.&#xD;
After the first sharp affliction of the death of the&#xD;
last of his parents had measurably subsided, Richard&#xD;
Grantner placed his sister at a reputable school, at&#xD;
Cheltenham, conducted by the venerable Dr. Gnout.&#xD;
Here, the youthful Mary grew up, under the watchful&#xD;
eye of her preceptor and his excellent family. Dr.&#xD;
Gnout had grown gray in the service of training the&#xD;
daughters of England; and many are the venerable&#xD;
matrons that now adorn the English Church and the&#xD;
" doctrine of God their Saviour," who reverence the&#xD;
memory of this noble man, and sanctify it in the eyes&#xD;
of their children. Every good influence, every holy ex-&#xD;
ercise was here brought to bear on the youthful mind and&#xD;
heart, 'to expand and train them for time and eternity.&#xD;
In the bosom of this pious family had Mary Grant-&#xD;
ner grown to woman's estate. For eight years, she had&#xD;
been accustomed to look up to Dr. Gnout as her father,&#xD;
and to his venerable lady as a mother. His children&#xD;
were as her own brothers and sisters. But now the&#xD;
&#xD;
time has arrived when these ties must be broken. The&#xD;
young must, by an absolute necessity, go forth into the&#xD;
world, to shape, under God's overruling providence, a&#xD;
destiny for themselves. Richard Grantner was expected&#xD;
the next morning, to convey her to her childhood's&#xD;
home, to meet, for the first time, the strange faces that&#xD;
lighted up her father's old mansion. Richard had been&#xD;
married fur some years ; and now the old halls rang&#xD;
again with the merry music of laughing voices and&#xD;
prattling tongues.&#xD;
That night, at an earlier hour than usual, Mary retired&#xD;
to her chamber. Her heart was full, too full to enjoy&#xD;
the society of her kind friends. Indeed, a heavy gloom&#xD;
seemed to pervade all countenances, in that hitherto&#xD;
happy family; for Mary was a universal favorite, and&#xD;
loved by all the family as a daughter and sister ; and&#xD;
there, in her own quiet chamber, she knelt before her&#xD;
God, and poured out her soul in prayer for strength and&#xD;
grace to meet her lot in life, and now to go forth into&#xD;
the world no more a girl, but a woman, to fulfil a&#xD;
woman's duty, and move in that sphere of usefulness&#xD;
which seemed about to open before her.&#xD;
Ah! sorrow is the portion of all hearts here below,&#xD;
especially of those who bear the cross. Unto it were&#xD;
they baptized when they were "made members of&#xD;
Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the Kingdom&#xD;
of Heaven."  They were baptized into the sufferings&#xD;
and sorrows of the Son of- Man, that they might also&#xD;
be partakers of His joys and crown of glory. We&#xD;
would d Pot dry the tears of the young girl who is about&#xD;
to go out into thp world to meet its realities, and espe-&#xD;
cially of Mary Grantner ; for there is yet a mightier&#xD;

sorrow before her. She had been in her room more&#xD;
than an hour, when the arrival of her brother was&#xD;
announced; and she would have wasted down to meet&#xD;
him. But, before she could assuage her tears, lie clasp-&#xD;
ed her in his arms in her room; and they wept together&#xD;
in joy and sorrow, and mingled their tears in one.&#xD;
Drawing her to a seat, lie said to her: "Mary, I have&#xD;
sad news for you; not, however, so much for you as for&#xD;
myself; but I know that what concerns me, will also&#xD;
concern you."  " Oh, brother, do tell me what it is. I&#xD;
hope that my dear sister, whom yet I have never seen,&#xD;
but whom I love for your sake, I hope nothing has hap-&#xD;
pened to her or your sweet little Bessy and Bob. I&#xD;
have been so sad all day, that my heart has been near&#xD;
breaking.".&#xD;
" No, my dear sister, nothing of that sort. Bessy,&#xD;
and Bob, and dear Maggie, all are well. But, Mary,&#xD;
your brother is a ruined man. You know, Mary, that&#xD;
I have never been able to say 'No;' that I have always&#xD;
felt obliged to do all the good that I could; that I&#xD;
could never endure to see one of our friends or relatives&#xD;
stand in need of a helping hand, without stepping for-&#xD;
ward to his aid. Cousin Robert, you know, was driving&#xD;
a large business in London; and, for the last six years,&#xD;
I have been in the habit of giving him my name and&#xD;
becoming security for him. Robert has failed, and I&#xD;
am penniless. I do not censure him. He is as honest&#xD;
a man as the world can produce. I had, you know,&#xD;
unbounded confidence in him; and my confidence does&#xD;
not swerve a hair's breadth. But, he has failed through&#xD;
the failure of others, and I am a beggar. All my&#xD;
property will not pay half my liabilities for him."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.            t'77&#xD;
"Brother, this is indeed sad news, but my heart is&#xD;
lightened of a heavy burden. Our happiness does not&#xD;
depend on wealth. We can be as happy in poverty as&#xD;
in wealth. We cannot, indeed, do so much good, but&#xD;
so much will not be required of us."&#xD;
" My sweet sister, you are to me like another angel&#xD;
of mercy. My own dear Maggie consoles me in the&#xD;
same way. I know it is right ; and I bless God for&#xD;
giving me grace to bear my trial, and for cheering me&#xD;
with two such godly and sympathizing friends and com-&#xD;
panions as you and my own Maggie. With your sym-&#xD;
pathy and encouragement, I feel that I can breast the&#xD;
wave. But ah me! how can I stagger through that&#xD;
overwhelming debt, or see the name of old Richard&#xD;
Grantner dishonored in London, where it passes as the&#xD;
sign-manual of all that is upright and honorable."&#xD;
"The name of Richard Grantner shall not be dis-&#xD;
honored, so long as I have a cent on the earth. I would&#xD;
beg my daily bread first !"&#xD;
"God bless you, my sister! But it will take every&#xD;
dollar we both are worth, to meet my liabilities for&#xD;
Cousin Robert."&#xD;
"Take it, then. And if that will not suffice, here&#xD;
is my jewelry. Never, never shall the name, you&#xD;
bear be dishonored, if I can save it. Poverty is no&#xD;
disgrace; and I welcome it, if on such terms it is to&#xD;
come."&#xD;
" But ah, my noble sister, I must insist on your not&#xD;
making such a sacrifice. Your property is all secure.&#xD;
And you must not beggar yourself on my account. I&#xD;
can buffet it through the world. But you I can never&#xD;
bear to see brought to so hard a struggle, for my sake.&#xD;

You have never yet buffeted your way in the rude&#xD;
world. No, sister, I love you too well."&#xD;
"Ah, you do not know me. It is true, I have never&#xD;
known a want. But, I am a woman; and your name&#xD;
and fame are dearer to me than dollars and cents.&#xD;
Perish the thought ! I know it will be a sore trial to&#xD;
us both, to see our dear old homestead and all our&#xD;
father's toils go into the hands of others. But what do&#xD;
you suppose he would do ? Ah, I know full well. And&#xD;
if, in Paradise, lie can know aught of earth, my deed&#xD;
will have his approbation. No, I can meet all. Fear&#xD;
not for me. If need be, I can come to toil, yea, drudgery&#xD;
and poverty, any thing but disgrace on our father's&#xD;
name. This is the lesson he taught us, when his locks&#xD;
were silvered over; this the milk which we drew from&#xD;
the breasts of our sainted mother; this the loving teach-&#xD;
ing which, for eight years, I have received beneath this&#xD;
hallowed roof.. And I will be true to it. I will not&#xD;
forsake you, brother. Your lot shall be mine. And if&#xD;
you love me, say no more in opposition to my course."&#xD;
In a twelvemonth, the magnificent estate of the&#xD;
Grantners was gone. The debt of their Cousin Robert&#xD;
was liquidated, and a few hundred pounds remained.&#xD;
In the spring of 18-, Richard Grantner, his wife,&#xD;
two children, and sister Mary, bade farewell to their&#xD;
native isle, and sailed in a packet-ship from Liverpool&#xD;
to the New World of enterprise and activity.&#xD;
Mary Grantner became the wife of William Wallace,&#xD;
and is the veritable mother of that little Agnes whom&#xD;
we met under the lamp, and whose story has entered&#xD;
into our former pages. We are writing from life. And&#xD;
life, as we have said before, runs often in crooked paths.&#xD;
&#xD;
And we have seen that Mary Grantner met her pledge.&#xD;
We have not dwelt on all her story. There is a chasm&#xD;
between her marriage and the evening that we found&#xD;
her in that paneless upper story. Over this we pass, as&#xD;
it is not the main part of our design to give her history.&#xD;
But she fulfilled her high pledge to her brother. She&#xD;
met toil, and drudgery, and poverty, without murmur-&#xD;
ing, believing that it came from God, blessing the hand&#xD;
that sent it, and looking up to Him for strength to bear&#xD;
whatsoever He sent.&#xD;
A sister's endurance, a mother's love: ah ! there is&#xD;
nothing like these on the earth. Treasure them, who..&#xD;
ever thou art that hast them. They are jewels, always&#xD;
bright and sparkling, but most so when our days are&#xD;
dark and friends are few. Nobody loves us as our&#xD;
mother. No one sympathizes with us as our sister.&#xD;
Alh me! I had a sister once, but she is gone; the&#xD;
tall grass waves over her grave; her pure spirit dwells&#xD;
in the Paradise of God. She died, leaving two babes,&#xD;
two innocent little cherubs, but two years apart in age.&#xD;
They never knew their mother. A frail, youthful, and&#xD;
lovely flower: oh, how soon was she nipt by the icy&#xD;
hand of death! And those little babes are now a prat-&#xD;
tling boy and girl; but they know not their uncle. They&#xD;
water the flowers over their mother's grave ; that is all&#xD;
they know of her; she sleeps so quietly there. But&#xD;
they yet shall see her and know her. Yes, in their&#xD;
Father's home above, there will be no more death, no&#xD;
more parting. Train them, Father, in their Spiritual&#xD;
Mother's bosoin, and they will not be long separated.&#xD;
They will go to her ; and angels shall introduce them&#xD;
to their Mother. Nay, she will know them, for God&#xD;

I saw her not in death; duty called us into different&#xD;
spheres and fields. The last time I saw her, the part-&#xD;
ing broke my heart. She clung around my neck, bath-&#xD;
ing me in tears. I tore myself from her, never more&#xD;
to see her in this life. The white-robed priest, a kind,&#xD;
good brother, knelt at her side, while her pure spirit&#xD;
went to meet its God. "My brother! oh, that I could&#xD;
see my dear brother !" were among her last words.&#xD;
Sleep on; blessed one; thou art in peace, and thy&#xD;
brother is yet struggling on, doing our Master's will.&#xD;
In His own good time we shall meet; and then, the&#xD;
time will have been short: "A thousand years in Thy&#xD;
sight are but as yesterday, seeing that is past as a watch&#xD;
in the night."&#xD;
And, then,, to be far, far away from home and friends,&#xD;
and receive a mother's letter ! Ah! there is a joy in&#xD;
this which all cannot appreciate. Hear how she writes:&#xD;
"Though you are far from me, I must try to be resigned,&#xD;
and commit you all to an all-wise God, who will ever&#xD;
be over those who trust in Him alone; for 'vain is the&#xD;
help of man,' and all things below are unsatisfying. I&#xD;
shall try to write more cheerfully, though it would be&#xD;
unnatural for me not to feel. And that you will admit,&#xD;
and think me more than callous if I could do so; for&#xD;
my thoughts will follow you, not always painting&#xD;
scenes that are brightest. A mother will, as long as&#xD;
life lasts, fondly cling to her children; yea, in death.&#xD;

flowers out, too, I suspect. Dear  , you must press&#xD;
me the first pretty bunch, and send it in a letter; I&#xD;
will keep it for your sake, and fancy you in the sunny&#xD;
South.&#xD;
" Half past twelve o'clock. No letters! sad news&#xD;
for me. Still I hope on till to-morrow. But, Sunday&#xD;
intervening seems to speak home to the soul; then all&#xD;
week duties are laid aside. The heart holds even a&#xD;
nearer and more holy communion with its God; then,&#xD;
if possible, far off and absent ones seem brought nearer.&#xD;
When we kneel in prayer, all the loved ones are re-&#xD;
membered; memory is set free from all that is earthly;&#xD;
and then we can bear them more fervently to the throne&#xD;
of the Lord in our prayers. Sing, sometimes, the songs&#xD;
you used to sing, dear -, for me ; and, when spring&#xD;
comes, our voices may mingle in the air together. Tell&#xD;
me what you'll sing at a certain hour of the evening,&#xD;
and I will sing the same, at the same hour ; though far&#xD;
away, there can be communion of thought and feeling.&#xD;
You used to love 'When the swallows homeward fly.'&#xD;
For your sake I sing it; and I often think of you, and&#xD;
apply many of the words to myself."&#xD;
Ah! our dear mother! It may be she may come&#xD;
and see us. Come on, mother, come on!&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
OLD AUNT JUDY s DEATH. THE COLORED POPULATION OF&#xD;
TIlE SOUTH CARED FOR BY THE CHURCH.&#xD;
PERHAPS, of all his parishioners in lleartfulville, none&#xD;
lamented Mr. Lovegood's departure more than old&#xD;
blind Judy, of whom we have casually spoken. Old&#xD;
Aunt Judy, as she was commonly called, had been a&#xD;
family servant of one of Mr. Lovegood's early friends&#xD;
in ieartfulville, a useful and pious member of the&#xD;
Church, whose eyes, Mr. Lovegood, assisted by Aunt&#xD;
Judy, had closed in death, some ten years prior to the&#xD;
events of which we now speak.&#xD;
Upon opening the will of the master, it was discov-&#xD;
ered, that he had given Aunt Judy her freedom, and&#xD;
had also willed her the house and lot on which she&#xD;
resided, and a hundred dollars per annum, as a life&#xD;
annuity. He had also willed his freedom to her grand-&#xD;
son Jim, whom she was required to support, until he&#xD;
was old enough to be of service to her. Not many&#xD;
years elapsed after the death of her master, before&#xD;
Aunt Judy was afflicted with blindness. She then&#xD;
became helpless, and Mr. Lovegood added to her annu-&#xD;
ity such items from the alms of the parish as sufficed for&#xD;
her comfortable maintenance. She was remarkable for&#xD;
good sense, strong attachments, and gratitude ; and one&#xD;
of Mr. Lovegood's most delightful employments, was to&#xD;
sit and converse with this humble old woman.&#xD;
Reader, be not astonished, when I tell you, that this&#xD;

&#xD;
is not so strange a circumstance as you may imagine.&#xD;
Condition, caste, does not raise a barrier insurmounta-&#xD;
ble between the pastor and those of the colored race,&#xD;
who, at his hands, receive the bread of life. There are&#xD;
numbers of devoted clergymen, throughout the South,&#xD;
who find great pleasure in ministering to the spiritual&#xD;
necessities of the colored race, whose attachments to&#xD;
the Church are very strong, ardent, and sincere, when&#xD;
they understand her true position. And this they are&#xD;
not slow in learning, when the true steps are taken to&#xD;
make them acquainted with the Church.&#xD;
Old Aunt Judy was a sincere, pious, and sound&#xD;
Churchwoman, for one in her humble life; she loved&#xD;
the Church for Christ's sake, and could take no comfort&#xD;
in any religious service, apart from her own private&#xD;
devotions, that was not sanctified by the Church's order.&#xD;
Hence, when Mr. Lovegood resigned the pastoral&#xD;
charge at Heartfulville, it filled her with sorrow. But&#xD;
she 'had one consolation: "Massa Lovegood had prom-&#xD;
ised to come back again on a visit, in the sweet month&#xD;
of June, and talk about old times." This was old&#xD;
Aunt Judy's theme, day and night. And as the spring&#xD;
opened, and the birds began to sing, and the flowers to&#xD;
burst into bloom, she seemed almost to grow young&#xD;
again. And day by day was she led down to the&#xD;
deserted study ; for she said she could "hear Massa&#xD;
Lovegood's mocking-birds, and she knew they were&#xD;
singing for him to come back again." This was pleas-&#xD;
ure enough for her ; and there she would sit, by the&#xD;
hour, on the steps at the study door. The days seemed&#xD;
long, tedious. Tedious they were to her; for the blind&#xD;
have a monotonous life: nothing but.reflection on the&#xD;

past, and communion with God, is left to them. T1&#xD;
is indeed full enough. But, flesh and the spirit w 11&#xD;
grow weary. So, day by day, Aunt Judy patiently&#xD;
waited at the study ; day by day, the mocking-birds&#xD;
trilled their notes as of old; day by day, the spirit of&#xD;
Aunt Judy grew more and more faint. The children,&#xD;
as they passed to and from school, always had a word&#xD;
for Aunt Judy, and she for them.&#xD;
" Ah, my child, Aunt Judy knows your voice, but&#xD;
she can't see you. ' Praise the Lord, 0 my soul, and&#xD;
all that is within me praise His holy name.' Ah, my&#xD;
child, Massa Lovegood taught me that sweet Psalm,&#xD;
long time ago. You are Massa D.'s daughter. Yes, I&#xD;
know you; the Lord bless you! I knew when your&#xD;
mother was.a little girl like you, and her mother used&#xD;
to bring her to see old missus. I could see then ! Ah,&#xD;
the old times, the old times !"&#xD;
And so the time wore away sadly ; ah, how sadly,&#xD;
for poor old Aunt Judy! It was now the middle of&#xD;
June, and Mr. Lovegood had not yet made his promised&#xD;
visit to his old parish. One day, as the children passed&#xD;
from school, they called, as usual, to Aunt Judy.&#xD;
There she sat in the same place, leaning against a&#xD;
column of the portico; but she answered not; they&#xD;
opened the wicker-gate, and went softly in, supposing&#xD;
she was asleep; but ah, Aunt Judy was sleeping the&#xD;
sleep of death! She held in her hand a newly-blown&#xD;
rose, which she had plucked from the multiflora that&#xD;
bloomed around her seat. She was gone. She had&#xD;
grown weary of waiting. Hope deferred maketh the&#xD;
heart sick. She had doubtless died, imploring bless-&#xD;
ings on her beloved pastor.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood arrived in Heartfulville the next day ;&#xD;
but, he was too late. His old blind alms-pensioner&#xD;
was gone to her last, long sleep. Death waits not; the&#xD;
aged gather their funeral robes around them, and they&#xD;
are gone. It was a heavy bereavement to Mr. Love-&#xD;
good ; for he loved old Aunt Judy, and had cherished&#xD;
the anticipations of her cordial greeting. But now he&#xD;
should greet her no, more, till he met her in that land&#xD;
where the blind are restored to sight. Then, together&#xD;
they should "see the King in His beauty !" And he&#xD;
wept, as few weep at the death of an humble colored&#xD;
woman. There being yet no Rector supplying his&#xD;
place, Mr. Lovegood on the next day committed her&#xD;
dust to its last resting-place.&#xD;
His days in that parish, he said, had run through&#xD;
so long a period with that humble servant of the Lord,&#xD;
that he could not refrain from improving the occasion,&#xD;
to hold up her example to the people of his late charge,&#xD;
as one worthy of their imitation. He rejoiced to see&#xD;
so much respect paid to departed worth, in the hum-&#xD;
blest circumstances ,of life. It was no ordinary occa-&#xD;
sion, that had brought such a concourse of young and&#xD;
old, high and low, bond and free, to the Lord's sanctu-&#xD;
ary. It was an evidence that Christian virtues were&#xD;
reverenced in the lowly, as well as in the more exalted;&#xD;
that the religion of Christ had a moral power and charm&#xD;
about it, which all must cherish, however they may fail&#xD;
in personal sanctity. The example of that humble&#xD;
Christian would live long in the memory of all who&#xD;
knew her. "The memory of the just is blessed;" "so&#xD;
He giveth His beloved sleep." "I heard a voice from&#xD;
heaven, saying unto me, Write, from henceforth bless-&#xD;

Spirit, that they may rest from their labors." Yea,&#xD;
there is no more conflict ; no more fear of the enemy ;&#xD;
no more strife with the flesh. They are called up high-&#xD;
er. The spirit goes forth to participate in the joys and&#xD;
fellowship of the Church Triumphant. There, released&#xD;
from  every sorrow 'and anguish of earth, free from&#xD;
dread of sin and temptation, the soul lives but to enjoy&#xD;
the blessedness of Paradise, awaiting with patient hope&#xD;
the Morning of the Resurrection, and the Day of Judg-&#xD;

and evil, and of the triumph of the God-man over all&#xD;
the powers of darkness, will be unfolded, and the dust&#xD;
of the grave shall revive, immortal, and be " clothed&#xD;
upon" with that body which God shall give it, and Par-&#xD;
adise shall be thrilled with the gladsome sympathies of&#xD;
an eternal fellowship. "Blessed are the dead who die&#xD;
in the Loun." Think what it is to be with the God-&#xD;
man Mediator ; not yet, indeed, admitted into the high-&#xD;
est glory which awaits the redeemed, but still enjoying&#xD;
His blessings, and rich foretastes of the final glory&#xD;
which shall be revealed at the last day. Think what&#xD;
it is to hear the melody of the heavenly hosts ; yea, to&#xD;
behold, and with the great Hooker, meditate on their&#xD;
" order and beauty," as they sweep their harps before&#xD;
the Throne ; to wear the white robes, and await with&#xD;
patience the day which is to reveal the secrets of all&#xD;
hearts, and write up the full history of the world, and&#xD;
the love that rescued man from ruin. Yea, "Blessed&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLERICAL TRIALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CLERICAL PLEASURES.&#xD;
SCHOOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SUNDAY&#xD;
&#xD;
A CLERGYMAN finds it impossible to please every one.&#xD;
Indeed, if he appreciates aright his office, he will never&#xD;
strive to do so at the sacrifice of truth, or a compromise&#xD;
of principle. He remembers the Lord's warning,&#xD;
"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!&#xD;
for so did their fathers to the false prophets." lie&#xD;
knows, that to be popular with all, he must speak&#xD;
things pleasing to all, and .must soinewhere let go duty,&#xD;
or the distinctive truths of the faith ; for, all men will&#xD;
not bear to have their hearts torn open, their spiritual&#xD;
deformities revealed, or the distinctive principles of the&#xD;
Church plainly set forth, and at the same time admire&#xD;
him who thus faithfully discharges his sacred functions.&#xD;
Disguise it from ourselves as we may, there can be&#xD;
little doubt, that the estimation in which the clerical&#xD;
office is held by the sect spirit, acts in a reflexive way,&#xD;
unfavorably upon the Church. Notwithstanding the&#xD;
sacredness of the holy office, and the authority with&#xD;
which it comes to us from God, and which are taught&#xD;
and recognized by the Church, most fully and distinct-&#xD;
ly, on the authority of Scripture, there is an under-&#xD;
current of sentiment, borrowed from some of the phases&#xD;
and doings of the denominations around us, pervading&#xD;
the minds of many who profess and call themselves&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
189&#xD;
&#xD;
Churchmen, which clings to and fosters the notion, that&#xD;
the clergy are merely preachers, and preachers, too,&#xD;
of the opinions of those who " hire" them, and pay&#xD;
them their wages : a sentiment which throws the great&#xD;
question of office, work, authority, out of view, or holds&#xD;
it in abeyance, and which measures the man as man,&#xD;
by a factitious rule, that finds its spring in the substitu-&#xD;
tion of a perverted will, for the living truth of the liv-&#xD;
ing God.&#xD;
The fact may be verified, by the current modes of&#xD;
thought and expression that pervade a parish, when a&#xD;
clergyman first enters on the discharge of his sacred&#xD;
functions. Each of his parishioners will have a fancy,&#xD;
and an opinion, or notion, of his own. The poor Rec-&#xD;
tor will be too high, or too low, for Mr. this or Mr. that.&#xD;
Sometimes, he will be too strict or too loose, too fiery or&#xD;
too prosy, too light or too heavy, too energetic or too&#xD;
dull. Sometimes, he will be too pointed and practical,&#xD;
or too airy and fanciful. He visits too much for Mrs.&#xD;
A., or too little for Mrs. B. He has too much voice for&#xD;
Mr. C., or too little for Mr. D.; and Mrs. E. declares it&#xD;
is awful, she can scarcely hear a word, forgetting that&#xD;
she is quite deaf, and that the clergyman cannot give&#xD;
her ears. And if he- speak of such things too plainly,&#xD;
he gives offence.&#xD;
For one party, he is not graceful enough in his de-&#xD;
livery, or he is too fast for Mr. Slow, or too slow for&#xD;
Mr. Fast. He has not a pleasant voice to the ear of Mr.&#xD;
Musical. Mr. Hard thinks nothing of a preacher who&#xD;
does not make him feel as though Satan were at the&#xD;
pew-door, and himself screwing up in the opposite&#xD;
corner to keep clear of him; and Mr. Soft cannot&#xD;

&#xD;
endure that style of sermonizing; he delights in the&#xD;
great outlines of the Gospel, in hearing sin abused, but&#xD;
cannot bear to be made to realize that himself is a sin-&#xD;
ner. "That suits A., B., or C., but I am not in the&#xD;
category." And alas ! Mr. Soft and Mr. Hard, could&#xD;
they both be pleased, would remain just the same, they&#xD;
would be not a whit better.&#xD;
Then, perhaps, the remiss Rector does not pay suiff-&#xD;
cient court and deference to Mrs. Tallman, or Miss&#xD;
Dasher. He is too ugly for Mrs. P., or too handsome&#xD;
for Mr. Q., who is resolute in the assertion, that all&#xD;
handsome clergymen are caressed until they are spoil-&#xD;
ed; or, he has preached pointedly against worldliness,&#xD;
mammon-seeking, and subserviency, or warned commu-&#xD;
nicants against taking the world to their bosom, and&#xD;
bowing before its fashionable requirements, in the mid-&#xD;
night rout and merry dance, and thereby offended some&#xD;
of the "upper tens ;" or, at some time, he has turned&#xD;
his back on the people, and faced the altar, and by&#xD;
some wise Methodistical body has been called by a bad&#xD;
name. Or, after all, and worse than all, he has been&#xD;
ground down by poverty, and a hard, rugged struggle,&#xD;
while his parishioners have lived in luxury, and lavished&#xD;
their thousands on the fashions and follies of a perishing&#xD;
world ; or, his little family, growing up around him,&#xD;
will have bodies to be clothed and mouths to be fed,&#xD;
and he cannot help it, and desires a little increase of&#xD;
salary : then, he is parsimonious, and a money-seeker.&#xD;
Alas! these are unpleasant reflections ; they fall not&#xD;
on paper with any degree of pleasure. We know they&#xD;
are true ; and the reader knows the same, although&#xD;
neither he nor the writer may have personally experi-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.            191&#xD;
enced them to any great degree. We write from life,&#xD;
from whose book we take our notes ; and we make no&#xD;
apologies.&#xD;
The reader is already aware of two facts in the&#xD;
thread of our sketch : first, that Mr. Lovegood would&#xD;
find some crooked characters in his new charge ;&#xD;
secondly, that he not only had the faculty of winning&#xD;
the affections of the young, but also of commanding, to&#xD;
a very high degree, their respect and obedience. On&#xD;
the afternoon that lie delivered his first sermon to his&#xD;
new congregation, a synopsis of which has already&#xD;
been given, he made his appearance in the Sunday&#xD;
School. He had a word of kindness for all the little&#xD;
boys and girls; and he called them his children, put-&#xD;
ting his hand on the head of each in turn, and asking&#xD;
his or her name. He said, lie had no doubt they all&#xD;
were good boys and girls. This pleased them very much ;&#xD;
not so much on the score of vanity ; but that it was a&#xD;
manifestation of confidence in them. If you wish to&#xD;
influence children for good, never act towards them as&#xD;
though you expected them to do wrong, but right.&#xD;
This was ever Mr. Lovegood's plan ; and so, on the&#xD;
present occasion, by manifesting this confidence in&#xD;
them, he gained theirs, and won upon their affections.&#xD;
" Now, boys," said he, " I know you are boys. You&#xD;
can spin a top, make and fly a kite, play marbles and&#xD;
ball, and bandy, and jump, and run, or turn a somerset,&#xD;
like all other boys, can't you?" " 0 yes, Sir !" ex-&#xD;
claimed they. " And you, girls," continued he, " can&#xD;
play doll and baby-house." " 0 yes, Sir," said the&#xD;
girls. "Yery well," said he, " boys and girls who can&#xD;

&#xD;
do these things, can get good lessons for Sunday School.&#xD;
So you see I shall expect you to be diligent, and always&#xD;
to know your lessons well; to be punctual in your&#xD;
attendance at school, and obedient to your spiritual&#xD;
teachers, pastors, and masters, as you are taught in the&#xD;
Catechism."&#xD;
The children's eyes sparkled with delight, as they&#xD;
retired from the Sunday School; and their little hearts&#xD;
danced with joy, as they looked forward to meeting&#xD;
Mr. L. on the coming Sunday. There was a bond of&#xD;
sympathy between him and them; they understood&#xD;
each other; he looked into their hearts, and they into&#xD;
his; they loved each other.&#xD;
But, one little fellow, Tom Jones, unfortunately mis-&#xD;
took the point raised by Mr. L.'s remarks about playing&#xD;
ball and turning somersets.  When, therefore, the&#xD;
aforesaid Tom reached home, to the infinite amusement&#xD;
of his parents and elder brothers, he deliberately drew&#xD;
a chair to the middle of the floor.  aving carefully&#xD;
inspected it on all sides, he stretched himself across it,&#xD;
and gradually let himself down, head foremost, until lie&#xD;
stood fairly on his head, holding himself in that posi-&#xD;
tion by the rounds of the chair; having satisfied him-&#xD;
self with this feat, in a moment he -trounced over on his&#xD;
back, making a pretty fair somerset.&#xD;
" There," says Tom, "I knew I could do it. I told&#xD;
him so." "Tommy, my dear," said his anxious mother,&#xD;
" what are you doing?  Are you crazy ?"  "No, in-'&#xD;
deed, mother," said Tom, with a grave face. " Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood told me I must turn somersets."   "Why,&#xD;
Thomas, are you beside yourself?"  "Deed, mother,&#xD;
he did," persisted Tom. "He asked me if I could do&#xD;
&#xD;
it, and I told him I could. And I am only trying ;&#xD;
for Mr. Lovegood told me it was my lesson for next&#xD;
Sunday, and that all the boys must see how smart they&#xD;
can be."&#xD;
Mrs. Jones, it is true, had good practical common&#xD;
sense enough to know, that Tommy had in some way&#xD;
nmisapprehended Mr. Lovegood ; yet it pleased her to see&#xD;
that son her was disposed to be attentive and obedient.&#xD;
But it was too good a joke not to be repeated; and, as&#xD;
most parents are fond of relating the naive tricks or&#xD;
smart little things in their children, that throw out in&#xD;
their estimation foreshadowings of a great future, we&#xD;
pardon Mrs. Jones for seeing in this act of the afore-&#xD;
said Thomas, the signs of a great Jones to be. That&#xD;
day, wherever the delighted mother went, Tommy's&#xD;
smart trick, as she termed it, was the theme of her con-&#xD;
versation ; and, indeed, it was a pleasant one. But, to&#xD;
Mrs. Jones's credit, we will say, that she had no thought&#xD;
of making any trouble for Mr. Lovegood, or affording&#xD;
for any one a ground of censure against him. She was&#xD;
quite a good, consistent Churchwoman, not given to&#xD;
gossiping nor fault-finding, always ready to esteem her&#xD;
Rector "very highly in love for his work's sake." She&#xD;
saw only Tommy's simple na'vets.&#xD;
Notwithstanding, the poor Rector was not to be free&#xD;
from the vials of wrath. When Mrs. Fastidious heard&#xD;
of it, she exclaimed, "she was positively shocked !&#xD;
Who ever heard of a clergyman's condescending to&#xD;
such an undignified thing, as to talk nonsense with&#xD;
children ! and she was sure they had all laughed right&#xD;
out in Sunday School. Suppose Tommy had made a&#xD;
little mistake; it was certain he did not fabricate it.&#xD;

ODOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Something of the kind must have occurred, and it was&#xD;
too undignified to be tolerated. Dear me, what are we&#xD;
coming to ? I'll ask Lucinda and Harry what Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood did say ; and I vow, if such talk was carried&#xD;
on, I'll send my children to Dr. Riproarer's Sunday&#xD;
School.  Pd rather they'd be Presbyterians, than&#xD;
sanction such doings; profanity, I had like to have&#xD;
said !"&#xD;
Mrs. Fastidious was certainly warm. Harry and Lu-&#xD;
cinda, when called upon, related exactly what Mr. L.&#xD;
had said, and how he said it. But it was useless ; they&#xD;
loved Mr. L., with the rest of the children; but, next&#xD;
Sunday, they were marched off to Dr. Riproarer's Sun-&#xD;
day School.&#xD;
These little cliques generally met to discuss the af-&#xD;
fairs of the Church and nation at large, at short inter-&#xD;
vals; not, indeed, by any set appointment, but acci-&#xD;
dentally, and yet with marked system and promptitude.&#xD;
The several members understood each other, sympa-&#xD;
thized with each other, and so were sympathetically&#xD;
drawn together.&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton was pretty much of the option&#xD;
of Mrs. Fastidious. "But it's the way these Puseyites&#xD;
have," she continued, " of winning upon our children.&#xD;
They get children attached to them by such means, at&#xD;
least Mr. Blemmerton says so ; and then it is vain for us&#xD;
even to try to make any thing out of them. Puseyites&#xD;
they are bound to be !"&#xD;
" Oh, me," said Mrs. Nochurch, "you don't mean to&#xD;
say that Mr. Lovegood is a Puseyite, do you, Mrs.&#xD;
Blemmerton ?" Mrs. Blemmerton was not yet fully pre-&#xD;
pared to pass sentence on that point. " You know,"&#xD;
&#xD;
continued she, " that we are very friendly with Mr. Love-&#xD;
good, and he has been twice to see us, and is very anx-&#xD;
ious to get Dele Airmyth to take a class in the Sunday&#xD;
School."  "Ah ha! I see," said Mrs. Fastidious; "I&#xD;
see !&#xD;
"Never mind. Mr. Lovegood thinks it a good thing&#xD;
to get young ladies interested in the Sunday School;&#xD;
he thinks .it a stepping-stone to better things ; and I&#xD;
think so, too ; and desire Dele to undertake it, very&#xD;
much. But she thinks she can never awake and dress&#xD;
in time to go. But I tell her, that I will have her&#xD;
waked very early. At any rate, I don't suppose that&#xD;
the Sunday School has any thing to do with Puseyism."&#xD;
"Now I wonder ! Do tell !"&#xD;
"Well, as I said, I do not wish exactly to give an&#xD;
opinion. I do decidedly think that his talking to the&#xD;
boys about such silly things was very reprehensible ;&#xD;
but you must be sure not to tell him that I said so.&#xD;
And as to Puseyism, I can tell' you only in a whisper,&#xD;
that Mr. Blemmerton did not like his sermon last Sun-&#xD;
day morning. We did not go in the afternoon; be-&#xD;
cause you know we never do; it is so decidedly unfash-&#xD;
ionable. And he said that Mr. Pleasants said, that Mr.&#xD;
Wise said, that Mr. Flanders said, that that sermon was&#xD;
decidedly unevan gelical. It was all about 'the minis-&#xD;
try,' and 'the Church,' and 'the sacraments, and 'the&#xD;
means of grace,' and the like. I profess to know but&#xD;
little about such things, but Dr. Thunderer, you know,&#xD;
the other night called all this the 'great sacramental&#xD;
system,' which he says is nothing more nor less than&#xD;
Romanism. And Dr. Thunderer is certainly high au-&#xD;
thority."&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
The ball, it will be perceived, was fairly in motion.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, his sermon, and his doings in the Sun-&#xD;
day School, were all duly discussed by this little gos-&#xD;
siping party, whose nature it was to complain of any and&#xD;
every thing, if for no other reason, because,--and it was&#xD;
a weighty "because,"-the whole management and&#xD;
control of every thing pertaining to the Church was&#xD;
not vested in them. And there are few parishes that&#xD;
do not, in some shape or form, encounter this portentous&#xD;
evil of gossiping ; a pragmatical, officious, intermed-&#xD;
dling temper, that perpetually crosses the injunction of&#xD;
the Apostle, "Study to be quiet, and to do your own&#xD;
business."&#xD;
We pause, not to dash into an essay on this theme,&#xD;
though it be very prolific. Yet we cannot forego the&#xD;
occasion to say, that a gossiping, intermeddling dis-&#xD;
position, is a most dangerous and unhappy one. It is&#xD;
ever prone to press beyond all reasonable bounds, from&#xD;
idle tattling to the overt act of bitter scandalizing. The&#xD;
consequence is, that the possessor of such a disposition&#xD;
is frequently rendered miserable, by the reaction of his or&#xD;
her own acts, and the merited rebuffs that they meet from&#xD;
those whose rights they have violated, or whose useful-&#xD;
ness they have impaired. And it is dangerous, because&#xD;
of the many evils that follow in its wake, and especially&#xD;
because the confirmed gossiper will ever be, on the&#xD;
alert, looking for work in his favorite employment,&#xD;
prone to seek it out, either by inquiry or surmise. And&#xD;
then there ensues all the misery of tattling, and back-&#xD;
biting, and false-accusing, vices pernicious to sound-&#xD;
ness of faith and Christian morality.&#xD;
A gossiping disposition is always unsettled, un-&#xD;

&#xD;
steady, and not apt or adequate to any thing great or&#xD;
noble ; or, if it succeed in developing striking traits or&#xD;
powers in one direction, they will be sure to be obscured&#xD;
or counterbalanced, by something that detracts from&#xD;
them in another. A truly great and well-balanced&#xD;
mind fastens itself upon specific and worthy objects,&#xD;
and to these it devotes all its mighty energies, and con-&#xD;
sequently develops and accomplishes great things.&#xD;
Boyle, young in years, mastered the whole round of&#xD;
philosophy, enlightened the world with his acquire-&#xD;
ments, and yet found ample time to discharge his duties&#xD;
to society and his fellow-men. He studied to be quiet,&#xD;
attended strictly to his sphere of duty, did good ; and&#xD;
his almost unbounded charities made glad the hearts of&#xD;
thousands of widows and orphans. Boyle was no gos-&#xD;
siper.&#xD;
Bacon, on the other hand, also a master of philoso-&#xD;
phy, a man whose attainments dispelled the falsities&#xD;
and mysticisms of the philosophy that had swayed the&#xD;
world, was tinctured, we believe, with a pragmatical&#xD;
disposition, and debased his high office by bribery and&#xD;
corruption ; and his great name, with all its honors,&#xD;
descends to posterity with a tarnish upon it.&#xD;
A gossiper is unsafe, and not to be trusted. A gos-&#xD;
siper cannot hold or keep a secret ; and will therefore&#xD;
be untrue, and not trustworthy. The gossiping spirit&#xD;
is inimical to the Gospel, inimical to growth in grace.&#xD;
Whoever is its possessor, bears about him or her, day&#xD;
by day, a misery and an evil; a plague through life,&#xD;
that may end in a plague throughout eternity.&#xD;
But, we opine, that Mrs. Blemmerton never made a&#xD;
greater mistake, than when she said Mr. Lovegood was&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
anxious to have Deliah Airmyth take a class in Sunday&#xD;
School. No such wish had been excogitated in his&#xD;
brain. The wish and the anxiety were both on the&#xD;
other side. Mrs. Blemmerton had proposed it herself,&#xD;
assuring Mr. Lovegood that she "hoped Dele had a&#xD;
decidedly pious turn, and needed only a little help to&#xD;
be brought to Confiirmation; for she had wept the best&#xD;
part of the night, about a week ago, and said, at last,&#xD;
'Well, I believe I'll give up the world.' Now that was&#xD;
a good sign. And she thought the Sunday School the&#xD;
best training-sphere for a preparation for confirmation.&#xD;
As to herself, she knew she was not good enough to&#xD;
think of such a thing ; but she desired to see her chil-&#xD;
dren pious, and Dele was at times so seriously inclined,&#xD;
that she was anxious on her account. Julia Jasper was&#xD;
too young ; she was not yet quite-seventeen. But Dele&#xD;
was older than she looked ; and it was quite time for&#xD;
her to assume a character of her own, and take a&#xD;
decided stand. Her brother, had he lived, would now&#xD;
have been thirty-six, and he was Dele's senior exactly&#xD;
ten years." This was right good arithmetic, and we&#xD;
suppose Mr. L. knew Miss Deliah's age.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood listened to all this, much as a man&#xD;
would, who was compelled to hear something against&#xD;
his will. Not many days elapsed, before, by mere&#xD;
accident, he heard all about Miss Deliah Airmyth's&#xD;
night of weeping. There had been a grand ball, to&#xD;
which Miss Deliah was invited ; but, unfortunately, a&#xD;
day or so before it came off, she, in running hastily up&#xD;
stairs, accidentally hurt her foot, which immediately&#xD;
swelled, and became very painful; and, refusing to&#xD;
yield to all emollients, and the best of medical skill, it&#xD;

compelled her to forego her anticipated pleasure. That&#xD;
was to, poor Miss Dele a night of weeping, indeed ;&#xD;
but she shed few tears of penitence, we opine, except&#xD;
in so far as she repented of running too hurriedly up&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood meditated on these developments ;&#xD;
and, like a discreet parson, he kept his meditations to&#xD;
himself.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
POLITICAL HUSTINGS. MR. BLEMMERTON BEFORE THE&#xD;
PEOPLE. A SICKNESS WORSE THAN SEA-SICKNESS.&#xD;
TIME, as it revolves on its great wheel, brings many&#xD;
changes. And still the old adage, " Truth is strangeI&#xD;
than fiction," is often verified. Mr. John Blemmerton&#xD;
has of late grown wonderfully liberal. Money seems&#xD;
no longer the leading object of his life. Indeed, it is&#xD;
rumored, that of late he has been seen several times to&#xD;
pause in the street, and drop a sixpence into the gaunt&#xD;
hand stretched out for alms. He has been known also,&#xD;
to put a quarter eagle into the bag, at a collection made&#xD;
in Dr. Thunderer's meeting-house, to defray the ex-&#xD;
penses of Dr. Orator to the World's Temperance Con-&#xD;
vention, to be held somewhere, perhaps in London.&#xD;
And, indeed, we may say it to his credit, that, although&#xD;
he does not contribute, he no longer grumbles that Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood takes a weekly offertory.&#xD;
He is found regularly in his pew in St.    -'s&#xD;
Church, on Sunday morning, and is disposed to be&#xD;
quiet, though at the last election for vestrymen his&#xD;
name was dropped. His Sunday evenings, as usual,&#xD;
are devoted to the services of Dr. Thunderer or Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer. And Dr. Riproarer has been heard to&#xD;
boast, that Mr. B. had subscribed five hundred dollars&#xD;
towards the building of his contemplated elegant meet-&#xD;
ing-house, which, it is rumored, is to be supplied with&#xD;
&#xD;
Li&#xD;
&#xD;
an organ of immense power, and to exhibit a gilded&#xD;
cross on the spire. And Dr. Riproarer does not hesi-&#xD;
tate to publish this act of Mr. B.'s abroad, right-lustily,&#xD;
as one of lasting honor and imperishable fame, and as&#xD;
a token of the liberal, unbigoted principles of the donor.&#xD;
In truth, take him all in all, in the world's eye, Mr.&#xD;
B. is a decided improvement. It is true, he will not&#xD;
contribute to any of the Church's appeals; has again&#xD;
and again refused demands from the Church, to aid&#xD;
feeble churches and missionary work. He pays his&#xD;
hundred dollars' pew-rent in St.    's Church, and&#xD;
that is all. But the Church goes on without him.&#xD;
Outside of the Church, he is decidedly in advance of&#xD;
himself. He talks much about the cause of humanity,&#xD;
temperance, benevolence, and, as we have said, he is&#xD;
right well disposed to assist with his means the popular&#xD;
movements of the day. His name, consequently, has&#xD;
of late figured largely in the papers in the dollar and&#xD;
cent line ; and many flattering letters of thanks have&#xD;
appeared in print, to Mr. John Blemmerton, for his&#xD;
noble responses to the calls of philanthropy.&#xD;
And Mrs. Blemmerton is more profuse than ever, in&#xD;
catering to the demands of fashionable society. Her&#xD;
parties are spoken of, as of the most " superb order,"&#xD;
manifesting in their getting up the most perfect non-&#xD;
chalance as to expense. In taste, in beauty, in magni-&#xD;
ficence, they eclipse the city. In addition to her former&#xD;
magnificent arrangements, she has converted a suite of&#xD;
rooms into a grand dancing-saloon, in whose decora-&#xD;
tions art, irrespective of cost, has lent her most exqi&#xD;
site touch of elegance and refinement. And when the&#xD;
glittering chandeliers pour out their flood of light, and&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
the exhilarating music floats over the throng, and the&#xD;
giddy whirl commences, Mrs. B. exults in her success,&#xD;
and receives with delight the plaudits of her guests, as&#xD;
they compliment her taste and judgment.&#xD;
"Miss Dasher declares tla this is equal to the days&#xD;
of Athenian splendor and elegance ;" and "Mr. Weak-&#xD;
in-the-Upper-Story thinks, that Mrs. B. has borrowed&#xD;
from the Athenians, and improved upon their pattern."&#xD;
Now Mr. and Mrs. Blemmerton, withal, were calcu-&#xD;
lating people. They counted the cost; they looked&#xD;
upon all these things as investments, which were to&#xD;
bring back their interest. By them, Mrs. B. purchased&#xD;
and maintained her position in fashionable society.&#xD;
And Mr. B. had of late taken it into his head, that he&#xD;
would not live in the world, without identifying his&#xD;
name with the great men of the age, and handing it&#xD;
down to posterity, with that gracious little contraction&#xD;
"lIon.," added to it. Both he and Mrs. B. had long&#xD;
since come to the conclusion, that "lion. John Blem-&#xD;
merton" would read well in print. Mr. B. must go to&#xD;
Congress. And the fact is announced, that, " at the&#xD;
solicitation of numerous friends, Mr. John Blemmerton&#xD;
has been reluctantly induced to allow himself to run for&#xD;
a seat in the next Congress."  The dear people are also&#xD;
told, of what they are undoubtedly already aware, that&#xD;
the aforesaid Mr. B. may be fully relied on as the&#xD;
unflinching friend of the poor man, and the working&#xD;
classes in general.&#xD;
We beg pardon of Jonathan Heartful, Esquire, for&#xD;
having lost sight of him so long. He is neither dead,&#xD;
nor buried, and therefore, "in the course of human&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
203&#xD;
&#xD;
events," it is rendered necessary that he appear again&#xD;
on the stage. Mr. i. had steadily pursued his profes-&#xD;
sion of the law, in the city of    , and now stood&#xD;
high in the estimation of his fellow-citizens. He had&#xD;
never sought the popular favor, nor striven to win it,&#xD;
but by a diligent and faithful application to his profes-&#xD;
sion. He had been no whining courtier of the dear&#xD;
people, and the dear people loved him all the more for&#xD;
it ; and now he was designated, by almost universal&#xD;
consent, as the proper one to take the field against the&#xD;
new champion, Mr. J. Blemmerton. The candidates&#xD;
are fairly in the field. The reader knows much more&#xD;
than we can tell him, about the doings of an election-&#xD;
eering campaign; and therefore we shall not attempt&#xD;
to particularize. The rival candidates for popular favor&#xD;
had frequently met at the public hustings, and discussed&#xD;
some of the leading political topics. Mr. B. always&#xD;
retired, sorely worsted and chagrined. And it hap-&#xD;
pened, that, at a public meeting a few days before the&#xD;
election, Mr. B., losing all self-control, took occasion to&#xD;
allude, in unmeasured terms -of harshness, to the pro-&#xD;
fession of his opponent, and his capabilities for the&#xD;
position which they both sought.&#xD;
"Lawyers," he said, "had ever had too much to do&#xD;
with the management .of our public affairs. It was&#xD;
time, he thought, that business men, who understood&#xD;
the wants of the people, and sympathized with them,&#xD;
who were the friends of the working-classes, had some&#xD;
control in state affairs. We want no mote legal men ;&#xD;
they are not the working-man's friend. They are the&#xD;
friends of their own pockets, and know how to charge&#xD;
exorbitant fees. Fellow-citizens," said he, in what he&#xD;

supposed to be an outburst of eloquent indignation, ''I&#xD;
would scorn to take an undue advantage of the posi-&#xD;
tion of my young friend, who asks your votes for a post&#xD;
of dignity; yet, as I desire to serve you faithfully, and&#xD;
you expect me to speak the truth, and know that I am&#xD;
your friend, as for long years we have together put our&#xD;
shoulders to the wheel," "Your own wheel!" cried&#xD;
one unruly voice. "To push on the great car of im-&#xD;
provement," "Of putting dollars in your pocket !" cried&#xD;
another. "To aid in lifting the working-classes from&#xD;
their degradation," " Rather to grind their faces," whis-&#xD;
pered another. "I must say, that, looking simply to the&#xD;
profession of our young friend, he presents no claim to&#xD;
your support. If he concocted a law, it would be so&#xD;
full of technicalities, that you would have to fee a law-&#xD;
yer, before you could understand it."&#xD;
Mr. Heartful deprecated the course Mr. B. had taken.&#xD;
He abhorred canting and hypocritical masquerading&#xD;
before the public. For himself, he had no promises to&#xD;
make, no claims of which to boast. He had not sought&#xD;
the position; and if he were not elected, he cared not&#xD;
a fig. But, since his opponent had challenged it at his&#xD;
hands, he would show up to the full gaze the fruits of Mr.&#xD;
B.'s great love for the working-man. He here went into&#xD;
a scathing account of the history of his treatment of&#xD;
William Wallace and his family, beneath which Blem-&#xD;
merton paled and trembled. Mr. H. said, that he re-&#xD;
gretted it; but, duty to the true cause of man compelled&#xD;
him to silence the pretensions that had that day been&#xD;
put forth. " And this," continued he, "is the poor&#xD;
man's friend! Alas ! alas! you say, for such friend-&#xD;
ship! Go ask the widow and the orphan ; go ask the&#xD;
&#xD;
naked and the hungry, spurned from that man's door;&#xD;
then listen to what you have heard to-day, and compare&#xD;
notes."&#xD;
Mr. B. little dreamed of all this. He was caught in&#xD;
his own trap. That story had come out.&#xD;
Mr. B. was sick abed until a month or more after the&#xD;
election. The phantom of distinguished honor was&#xD;
much farther off than ever. He could scarcely see its&#xD;
gaunt, skeleton arm, raised in the mist which seemed&#xD;
to envelop it, beckoning him on. He gave up the&#xD;
chase. Jonathan Heartful was elected, as the papers&#xD;
announced, by a "tremendous majority." And we&#xD;
may leave him in Congress, to shift for himself, and&#xD;
sharpen his wits by a conflict with the wits of the great&#xD;
men of the nation.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
A DEATH-BED AND A DISCOVERY.&#xD;
Mus. WALLACE had been gradually declining, since&#xD;
her kind friends had provided so amply for her com-&#xD;
fort. Mr. Lovegood had long since made her acquaint-&#xD;
ance ; and now was found daily at her bedside, minis-&#xD;
tering, and deriving instruction and consolation, from&#xD;
communing with the saintly spirit, clothing itself for the&#xD;
world to come. We ever seem to be nearer heaven,&#xD;
when, holding converse with the saintly one, who,&#xD;
drawing near to "the valley of the shadow of death,"&#xD;
must soon stand in the Lord's courts. It seems as&#xD;
though we already stood within the hallowed " circle&#xD;
of the redeemed" who "rest from their labors," and&#xD;
partook of their beatific joys. And 0, how changed&#xD;
is the aspect of death, when viewed at the dying couch&#xD;
of the humble Christian, from what it is when seen in&#xD;
one who has lived without God in the world, and passes&#xD;
away without Hope beyond ! We have, indeed, seen&#xD;
the wretchedly-hardened and wicked die calmly ; but,&#xD;
there was no Heaven in that calmness. Stoical indif-&#xD;
ference, or obtuseness, has no mark of the Cross. It&#xD;
cannot be imposed upon us, for the impress of a sancti-&#xD;
flied heart and will. It is not the hallowed calm, as of&#xD;
angel-whisperings, foreshadowing rest beyond the tomb.&#xD;
And we have seen one, whose sanctity was unques-&#xD;
tioned, pass through an "awful baptism" of sufferings,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
207&#xD;
&#xD;
shuddering over the grave, shrinking from death, its&#xD;
cold embrace and icy touch, and piteously lamenting&#xD;
a want of preparation.&#xD;
It was but a sore temptation of "the evil one ;" for&#xD;
that trembling spirit had, for long years, been braced&#xD;
by the Grace of Immanuel. We never knew one more&#xD;
lovely in her Christian character, more watchful, more&#xD;
prayerful, more given to self-examination, more devoted&#xD;
to all charities and good works. She had been a pat-&#xD;
tern-woman, in all that was beautiful and attractive in&#xD;
Christian excellence; and yet, when the "dread mon-&#xD;
arch" approached her, the flesh was appalled, and the&#xD;
spirit trembled, as it gazed, with undimmed eye, into&#xD;
the awful profound of eternity.&#xD;
Never shall we forget that scene. For long, weary&#xD;
hours, did she wrestle with that temptation. She felt as&#xD;
though she were deserted of heaven, and stood alone,&#xD;
without hope and without consolation. We prayed&#xD;
with her, reasoned with her, read to her the most thrill-&#xD;
ing and cheering promises of her divine Lord ; por-&#xD;
trayed to her the Cross, and the great redemption there-&#xD;
on wrought, and the mercies by it bestowed, and the&#xD;
mighty hopes and privileges which were hers, as a fol-&#xD;
lower of Christ. And when the temptation was over,&#xD;
she seemed like one who had passed through a great&#xD;
conflict of afflictions. But, the "Sun of righteousness"&#xD;
gilded all the rest of her way to "the dark valley."&#xD;
She partook of the sacred symbols of her Lord's body&#xD;
and blood, and received strength; and, as the clouds&#xD;
rolled away, and the spirit breathed freely again, such&#xD;
a radiant countenance, almost as if transfigured, and&#xD;
such sweet, heavenly musings, we never beheld, never&#xD;

heard. It seemed, that the very chamber was bathed with&#xD;
light from heaven, and that the spirit of the dying was&#xD;
about to dissolve and pass away, in its kindred element.&#xD;
It was a glorious evening in Spring, the Sunday&#xD;
next before Easter. The toils of the day being over,&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was seated in his study, meditating on&#xD;
the services of the day through which he had passed,&#xD;
and the duties and employments of the ensuing Passion&#xD;
Week, and "the great day," to which it is a prelude.&#xD;
Of all the hours of a clergyman's life, his Sunday&#xD;
evenings are, without doubt, the most pleasurable and&#xD;
happy. 'Tis then, more than at any other period, per-&#xD;
haps, that his heart is free and light and joyous ; not&#xD;
that the day's work is done, but that he has added one&#xD;
more effort to the labors of&#xD;
&#xD;
that,&#xD;
&#xD;
'The Sundays of man's life,"&#xD;
"Threaded together on time's string,&#xD;
Make bracelets to adorn the wife&#xD;
Of the Eternal, glorious KING !" &#xD;
&#xD;
And his heart, so lately pouring itself out in prayer, at&#xD;
the holy altar, in behalf of his flock, now gushes out in&#xD;
the calm, quiet, hallowed evening hour, with joy and&#xD;
thanksgiving for all the mercies of the day, and the&#xD;
holy message which he hath delivered; and he meditates&#xD;
with delight on that "Sabbath" of rest which is eternal.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood is interrupted in his meditations by&#xD;
Mr. Friendly. Mr. F. is always a welcome visitor; but,&#xD;
on this occasion, he brought painful intelligence. He&#xD;
had just paid his usual evening visit to Mrs. Wallace, and&#xD;
* Herbert.&#xD;

&#xD;
found her dying. They hurried to the home of the dying&#xD;
woman. Her illness had suddenly increased. And there,&#xD;
on this hallowed eve, did Sarah Wallace partake of her&#xD;
last Communion on earth. Henceforth, she will com-&#xD;
mune with all saints in Paradise.&#xD;
The commendatory prayer was said; and the faith-&#xD;
ful Pastor remained to see the last struggle, and wipe&#xD;
the death-damps that gathered on the brow.&#xD;
The reader will remember, that, in a former chap-&#xD;
ter, we spoke of a curiously-wrought antique silver cup,&#xD;
which we saw in a cupboard at Mrs. Wallace's. This&#xD;
cup, on the present occasion, by an apparent accident,&#xD;
having attracted Mr. Lovegood's attention, he took it&#xD;
into his hand, and, after examining it minutely, re-&#xD;
marked, "lIt is singular, very singular ; but this cup, in&#xD;
a mysterious way, revives old associations."&#xD;
He looked first at it, and its initials, and then intently&#xD;
at Mrs. Wallace : " How strange !" exclaimed he. " It&#xD;
is now many years since I have seen any thing like it;&#xD;
but I cannot mistake ; the impression is too vivid ; it&#xD;
is the very pattern and style of my mother's silver&#xD;
ware!&#xD;
The dying woman, in hurried and broken accents,&#xD;
informed him, that it was a gift from her mother, when&#xD;
she was a little girl. The initial "G" stood for her&#xD;
maiden name, Grantner. It was all that she retained&#xD;
which bore any trace of the past, except the weary&#xD;
heart, which was about to find rest. Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
was deeply moved. His eyes filled with tears. Mrs.&#xD;
Wallace continued a brief narrative of her past history,&#xD;
seeming to be braced with almost superhuman strength,&#xD;
in thevery grasp of death. She told him all the sacrifices&#xD;

she had made for her cousin Robert, as already detailed,&#xD;
prior to her removal to this country ; and, to render&#xD;
those sacrifices more complete, her brother Richard had&#xD;
died, shortly after reaching the New World. Bereft&#xD;
of every earthly friend, she had shared the lot and life&#xD;
of poverty and hardships of William Wallace. So long&#xD;
as he retained his health, and poverty and disease did&#xD;
not overcast their days, they continued faithful and&#xD;
regular in their attendance on the Church's services,&#xD;
and received the attention of the Rector of the church&#xD;
in which they worshipped; but, the Rector dying, a&#xD;
new clergyman succeeded him, and, his duties increas-&#xD;
ing, they were gradually lost sight of, until extreme&#xD;
suffering had brought them to the condition in which&#xD;
they were found on that memorable night by Mr.&#xD;
Heartful.&#xD;
" And your mother," said Mr. Lovegood, "was Mary&#xD;
Gould ?" The dying woman fixed her glazed eyes upon&#xD;
him, and gasped for breath, groaning aloud.&#xD;
" And I, and I," continued he, choked with emotion,&#xD;
" am the son of your mother's sister, Grace Gould, who&#xD;
married Robert Lovegood, your own cousin. 0 God!&#xD;
wonderful art Thou in all Thy ways ! Verily Thou art&#xD;
a God that hidest Thyself, 0 God of Israel the Sa-&#xD;
viour !"&#xD;
We intrude not upon the sanctity of that scene. When&#xD;
the first gush of feeling, occasioned by the recognition,&#xD;
had subsided, Mr. Lovegood gave her a brief relation&#xD;
of his life in this country. His father had removed&#xD;
hither, when his children were very young, bringing&#xD;
them all with him except the eldest, whom he left to be&#xD;
educated, and to engage in mercantile business; and&#xD;

he died some years after his arrival, leaving an embar-&#xD;
rassed estate and a helpless family. His mother turned&#xD;
the remnant of her property into ready money, and&#xD;
removed to the West. There, meeting with many pri-&#xD;
vations, in a new and rugged country, she had, from&#xD;
the force of circumstances and pressing duties, imper-&#xD;
ceptibly become weaned from her early associations;&#xD;
and, for a number of years before her death, had ceased&#xD;
to have any communication with her friends in England.&#xD;
Hence he knew nothing of the intervening history of&#xD;
his relatives. All, to him, between the period of his&#xD;
father's death and that hour, pertaining to the history&#xD;
of his family in England, was a blank.&#xD;
"And," continued he, "how providential, that that&#xD;
old silver cup should have made such a revelation of the&#xD;
past. Truly, the ways of Providence are mysterious.&#xD;
And this is your dear daughter Agnes. Henceforth,&#xD;
she shall be mine ; the object of my care and affections.&#xD;
.Come to me, my child. I will be unto you a father,&#xD;
from this hour, and make amends for the past. " 0&#xD;
my soul, be joyful in the Lord !"&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood cast his eyes upon the bed: the spirit&#xD;
had passed away with that exulting sentence, and gone&#xD;
on angels' wings to Paradise.. Death reigned. A&#xD;
heavenly smile played a moment on the lips, which&#xD;
seemed to hallow the scene, and proclaim that all was&#xD;
well.&#xD;
The Pastor, with a full heart, sunk upon his knees,&#xD;
and poured out his heart in that beautiful prayer of the&#xD;
Church&#xD;
"O God, whose days are without end, and whose&#xD;
mercies cannot be numbered; make us, we beseech&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
FEMALE EDUCATION. CHRISTIAN NURTURE.&#xD;
IT was not without counting the cost, that Mr. Love-&#xD;
good had volunteered to pledge himself to the pleasing&#xD;
task of becoming a father unto the fatherless, Agnes&#xD;
Wallace. The ties of consanguinity, which he had just&#xD;
discovered, rendered this a still more delightful duty,&#xD;
for such he felt it to be.&#xD;
Upon examining the family Bible of his deceased&#xD;
cousin, he found a register, setting forth the date of the&#xD;
birth of Agnes, and also of her baptism by the Rector&#xD;
of        Church. And it only remained to him to&#xD;
train her, as " a member of Christ, the child of God,&#xD;
and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." He was&#xD;
not long in discovering, that her pious mother had been&#xD;
diligent in instructing her in the Catechism ; and, with&#xD;
her amiable disposition and gentle manners, softened, if&#xD;
not refined, by the trials through which she had passed,&#xD;
this meek lamb of the flock of the Great Shepherd&#xD;
needed only the fostering hand of diligence and love, to&#xD;
become an ornament to her sex, a gem  among the&#xD;
many bright jewels which adorn the "Bride of Christ "&#xD;
Nature had lavished upon her, with no sparing hand,&#xD;
the graces of a comely person, now bursting into&#xD;
womanhood, and a mind which only needed cultiva-&#xD;
tion to be expanded for a wide field of action in the&#xD;
sphere of female usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;

DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
We condescend not to the trivial office of a mere&#xD;
flatterer of feminine virtues ; for we honestly believe,&#xD;
that there is no virtue becoming in the gentler sex, that&#xD;
is not equally so in man. Still we shall hope not to be&#xD;
held to too strict an account, for expressing the opinion,&#xD;
that most of the good to be found in this lower world&#xD;
dwells in the heart of woman, and from thence issues&#xD;
forth on its errand of mercy in the world; smoothing&#xD;
the roughnesses of man's nature, mollifying his heart,&#xD;
and causing light to spring up in the abodes of wretch-&#xD;
edness, bringing tears of gratitude and thanksgiving&#xD;
from  the hearts of the sorrowing. And woman, in&#xD;
making those around her happy, sows with a liberal&#xD;
hand seeds that are to vegetate and bloom in many&#xD;
hearts, long years after she has been gathered to her&#xD;
reward.&#xD;
It is Sydney Smith, we believe, that says, "Mankind&#xD;
are always happier for being happy now ; you make&#xD;
them happy twenty years hence by the memory of it."&#xD;
And so, a real, true woman, fulfilling her sphere on&#xD;
earth, casting her bread upon the waters, from the full&#xD;
hand of her charities, and the benedictions of her&#xD;
heart, stands in the centre of a vast circle of delights,&#xD;
that ascendeth from the earth up to the throne'of God,&#xD;
and descends again, dispensing joy, and pleasant memo-&#xD;
ries, and winged words, and deeds of love, and heavenly&#xD;
blessings.&#xD;
But, alas! how our modern notions of "fashionable.&#xD;
life" have dwarfed her to a mere shred of what she&#xD;
ought to be !&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, though not a parent, had weighed&#xD;
the duties of the parental relationship in all their bear.&#xD;
&#xD;
ings, and resolved to fulfil them faithfully, to the being,&#xD;
of whose training, for time and eternity, he had assumed&#xD;
the responsibility. He had little confidence in what is&#xD;
termed a "fashionable education," in which the deep&#xD;
cravings of the spiritual nature are neglected or over-&#xD;
looked. And even thorough mental training receives&#xD;
but small attention, in comparison with a few surface-&#xD;
work adornments, which meet the demands of the&#xD;
world of pleasure and fashion, such as dancing, waltz-&#xD;
ing, singing a song, or performing charmingly on the&#xD;
piano. Not that he would discard such accomplish-&#xD;
ments and graces as adorn woman, but that he would&#xD;
teach her, that her true destiny is to move in a sphere&#xD;
more hallowed and ennobling, than that of the mere&#xD;
devotee of fashion and amusement ; that to be great,&#xD;
and good, and wise, and holy, she must learn to do&#xD;
good, thread the needles of charity, make music in all&#xD;
hearts; the hearts of the poor, the outcast, the down-&#xD;
trodden of earth ; and so help the angels in their work.&#xD;
This, he would teach her, becomes her much more&#xD;
than to be a splendid and graceful dancer, or a mere&#xD;
bewitching, captivating enchanter, winning to her side&#xD;
a train of ardent admirers, not by the graces of the&#xD;
heart, but by the often unreal, unsanctified blandish-&#xD;
ments and adornments that are assumed for the moment,&#xD;
only to be laid aside, as a soiled or useless garment,&#xD;
when she shrinks into her real self.&#xD;
A "fashionable " education is but a portion of the&#xD;
grand scheme of Mammon. And what does a Church-&#xD;
man want with such an education for his daughter ? It&#xD;
is an education devoted to the beguilements of sin and&#xD;
pride, in their multiform modes of compliance with the&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;

"fashion of this world, which passeth away ;" which&#xD;
too often teaches our daughters, that to be accomplish-&#xD;
ed, complaisant, and fascinating in a worldly sense ; to&#xD;
wear, it may be, a mask beautiful to look upon, but&#xD;
devoid of any sign of the cross, or of the real, whole-&#xD;
souled woman ; is, after all, the main object of her&#xD;
existence.&#xD;
And yet, what but a schooling,-for education it is&#xD;
not,-of this character, do our daughters derive in those&#xD;
" fashionable " schools where the HOLY CHURCH enter-&#xD;
eth not, with her sanctifying influences, and where her&#xD;
system is not faithfully, fully, and distinctly carried out?&#xD;
Is there any true heart-training in them? Is the spirit-&#xD;
ual woman cultivated, developed, drawn out, and fitted&#xD;
for a sphem of high and ennobling Christian fellow-&#xD;
ship and charity? Is it not, at least, a schooling of&#xD;
selfishness, that narrows down, dwarfs, blunts, and often&#xD;
deadens, the spiritual nature, imprinting a lie upon the&#xD;
heart, and setting a weight upon the conscience ? Do&#xD;
not our fashionable schools aim, implicitly at least, to&#xD;
make woman a mere gew-gaw, a gilded butterfly, to&#xD;
bask a day in the sunshine of this world's smile, leaving&#xD;
the IMMORTAL SPIRIT a sickly, drooping thing, unfitted&#xD;
to meet the stern realities of life, or to go out into the&#xD;
world to feel the great throbbing heart of humanity,&#xD;
and sympathize with its pulsations, or to hear the low&#xD;
wail of its voice, as it cries aloud to heaven for succor?&#xD;
They who minister in holy things in times of calamity,&#xD;
know how to look about them for the women of heart&#xD;
and hand, and greatness of soul ; who can walk into the&#xD;
pestilence, and banish gloom and despair, as they softly&#xD;
move about the bedside of the sick and dying. But&#xD;

&#xD;
ah ! how few, in comparison with the numbers of the&#xD;
gay daughters of pleasure and fashion, are thus schooled&#xD;
in works of mercy and love.&#xD;
And now, will fathers and mothers, who drink at the&#xD;
pure fountains of the Church of the living God, who&#xD;
in Holy Baptism have consecrated their daughters unto&#xD;
the Lord's service, turn their little ones over to the&#xD;
world,-the meager, half-dead, starveling world,-to be&#xD;
educated ? . Will they neglect the spiritual culture of&#xD;
the souls whom the Lord will require at their hands ?&#xD;
Will they neglect to expand the little hearts given them&#xD;
of the Lord, to be trained for His honor and glory? or&#xD;
to teach those feeble hands, which, in their helplessness,&#xD;
are stretched out to them, how to bear the Cross? or&#xD;
to train those little feet, which, without their loving&#xD;
guidance, must tread on thorns, and mark their pathway&#xD;
with blood, how to walk in "the narrow way that lead-&#xD;
eth unto life ?"&#xD;
Everywhere, north, south, east, west, does the ques-&#xD;
tion of Christian nurture force itself upon the Christian&#xD;
consciousness of fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, pa-&#xD;
triots, and philanthropists. The Gospel makes it ever&#xD;
a prominent theme. And the Church-system, which is&#xD;
the Gospel system, looks narrowly to the training of the&#xD;
young. How guarded is our blessed spiritual mother,&#xD;
in the nurture of the lambs of her fold. How closely,&#xD;
and with what tender motherly love, does she press&#xD;
them to her bosom! First, she brings them to the Font,&#xD;
"the laver of regeneration ;" then, into the Sunday&#xD;
School, where she places them under the eye, and hand,&#xD;
and heart, of the Pastor, as catechumens, to be taught&#xD;
the way of life, and what "holy things" they were&#xD;

made, and what holy blessings they received in baptism.&#xD;
She calls upon the parents and sponsors, to train them&#xD;
in their high calling and profession, to keep their vows,&#xD;
promises, and privileges, ever before them. Then she&#xD;
calls them to Confirmation, the assumption and ratifi-&#xD;
cation of their baptismal vows and promises ; and from&#xD;
thence to the Holy Communion, to feast on that heavenly.&#xD;
food which the Lord vouchsafes to give for their life.&#xD;
She would never leave them to chance, or the " educa-&#xD;
tion of circumstances," but would ever draw them close&#xD;
to her heart, and teach them that they are "Christians,"&#xD;
very members of Christ's mystical body, and have them&#xD;
nurtured as Christians, not feeding on the beggarly ele-&#xD;
ments of the world, but on the wholesome nourishment&#xD;
which the Lora gives through the Word, and Ordinances&#xD;
of the Church; so that, like their divine Lord, as they&#xD;
grow in stature, they may also grow in wisdom, and in&#xD;
favor with God and man.&#xD;
And 0 how lovely, how sanctified, is this system of&#xD;
the Church, which from the Font never loses sight of&#xD;
the holy privileges which, in the sacrament of Baptism,&#xD;
were made over to our children, even that then they&#xD;
were "made members of Christ, children of God, and&#xD;
inheritors of the kingdom of heaven."&#xD;
But, alas ! how lamentably is this great Gospel system&#xD;
lost sight of, at this day of Mammon-seeking, by many&#xD;
who stand in "the old paths."  And how are we to&#xD;
expect a growth of grace in our offspring, commen su-&#xD;
rate with their privileges, unless parents earnestly and&#xD;
faithfully perform their duty ?*  The grace- conveyed&#xD;
&#xD;
* Rev. Dr. M. P. Parks.&#xD;
&#xD;
in Holy Baptism needs cultivation, in order to its&#xD;
growth and development, just as the grain of corn&#xD;
planted in the earth requires the diligent hand of the&#xD;
husbandman, in order to its thrifty growth, and the&#xD;
bringing forth of the full-grown blade and ripened ear.&#xD;
Thus, cultivation must be given by the parent, in the&#xD;
ways of the Church, or, like the poorly cultivated grain&#xD;
of corm, which, though planted in a rich and genial soil,&#xD;
produces but a half-grown, blighted, sickly plant, the&#xD;
youthful "member of Christ" will grow up, bearing the&#xD;
marks of blight, sickly, diseased, and unproductive, in&#xD;
the spiritual life.&#xD;
And if the child grow up in wickedness, dishonoring&#xD;
its calling, tarnishing its white robes, will any dare say,&#xD;
that no grace was given in baptism, no gift of the Holy&#xD;
Ghost to profit withal ? Who censures the grain of&#xD;
corn, or the soil, for failing, when the hand of diligence&#xD;
has neither tilled, nor cut out the rank weeds that choked&#xD;
the grain, and hindered its thrifty growth? Nay, with-&#xD;
out doubt, the fault lies at the door of the parent, who&#xD;
failed in the Chiistian nurture of the child. Let pa-&#xD;
rents, then, who would be faithful to their solemn trusts,&#xD;
give their hearts to this subject ; let them take an in-&#xD;
terest inthe Sunday School, and, above all, in the strict&#xD;
systematic Parochial School, and higher Church schools&#xD;
and colleges, in which the every-day life of their children&#xD;
is moulded heavenward. Let them watch over their&#xD;
training, by day and by night ; see that they are duly&#xD;
instructed in the Catechism, and in all other things that,&#xD;
a Christian ought to know, and believe, and do, for his&#xD;
soul's health. Then may we look for the fruits of God's&#xD;
grace and Holy Spirit in Baptism; then may parents&#xD;

expect tosee their children growing up in "the nurture&#xD;
and admonition of the Lord ;" to behold them as "pol-&#xD;
ished corners in the Temple" of our God; and see them&#xD;
coming up around them, to fill their places in the Church&#xD;
and the world, when they are gone. In them they&#xD;
shall, as it were, live again ; their memory will be em.,&#xD;
balnined in the lives of their posterity; their names shall&#xD;
not perish from the earth.&#xD;
Children are the hope of the Church; the gems, and&#xD;
jewels, and treasures of the Gospel; yea, the Lord hath&#xD;
said, "of such is the kingdom of heaved;" the sweet,&#xD;
gentle scions that are coming up around us, to fill our&#xD;
places, to stand before the Lord's altars, worship in His&#xD;
holy temple, go out on the wings of love to bind up the&#xD;
broken-hearted, to wield the powers of government, to&#xD;
receive from us the civil and religious heritage which&#xD;
we possess, and transmit it to the generations that come&#xD;
after them. And O, if we look into the mighty future,&#xD;
what immense issues and destinies, in the Providence of&#xD;
God, hang upon the training which the rising genera-&#xD;
tion is to receive now, while under tutorage and gov-&#xD;
ernment. The day is rapidly coming, when the history&#xD;
will be written up, of what we have done, of what we&#xD;
are doing.&#xD;
What Tacitus says, may be true of the productions of&#xD;
the earth :-" Many things are sown, and brought to&#xD;
maturity with toil and care ; yet that which grows from&#xD;
the wild vigor of nature has the most grateful flavor;"&#xD;
but it is not true of the things of divine grace. Our&#xD;
fallen man's nature, from its "wild vigor," brings forth&#xD;
that which is ungrateful, unwholesome, and full of rot-&#xD;
tenness and corruption. But, as we have seen the un-&#xD;

fruitful vine, transplanted into a more congenial soil,&#xD;
spreading forth its branches, clustering with fruits, lift-&#xD;
ing its head towards the sun, and living upon the co-&#xD;
pious showers which fall from heaven; so, our fallen&#xD;
man's nature, taken out of that fallen, unproductive&#xD;
state, and planted in the Lord's vineyard, and there&#xD;
duly trained and cultivated, is made alive and vigor-&#xD;
ous, and productive of all good fruits, in the fulness of&#xD;
the divine grace, and the care of the blessed Husband-&#xD;
man, and the refreshing waters which flow from the&#xD;
living fountain of Christ's love.&#xD;
Such, Christian parent, is the condition of your off-&#xD;
spring who have, in Baptism, been "planted together&#xD;
in the likeness of Christ's death," if you are faithful at&#xD;
your posts. But, all depends upon that. And the ques-&#xD;
tion for you to decide is, whether you will train them&#xD;
in and for Christ and the Church, or leave them to&#xD;
chance.&#xD;

222     THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
A STOMACHIC CHARACTER. A DISCUSSION ON SINCERITY.&#xD;
A 5sHAM COURTSHIP.&#xD;
WE beg leave here to introduce to the kind indul-&#xD;
gence of the reader, Mr. Benjamin Slocum Sapientium,&#xD;
as we shall have occasional use for his good services.&#xD;
Ben Slocum, as he was called, was the nephew of Mrs.&#xD;
Blemmerton, and held the responsible post of an under-&#xD;
clerk in- the establishment of Mr. John Blemmnerton.&#xD;
He wrote a good clerical hand, knew how to cast up&#xD;
accounts, make a close bargain, mark, measure, and&#xD;
fold up domestics, and the like, and sometimes he&#xD;
"did" the marketing ; but farther as to the said Ben's&#xD;
mental calibre, this deponent would not like positively&#xD;
to speak.&#xD;
Public rumor, not, however, always a reliable au-&#xD;
thority, persisted in saying, that the aforesaid Ben was&#xD;
rather weak in the upper-story, had more stomach than&#xD;
brains, or, as with a nameless scapegrace, perhaps his&#xD;
brains lay in his stomach. Be that as it may, the afore-&#xD;
said Ben Slocum had never made any stir in the world,&#xD;
nor in any way come into public notice. He some-&#xD;
times grinned, when addressed, by way of showing that&#xD;
he was conscious of existence, and had a handsome set&#xD;
of teeth, the only thing of which he could boast, ex-&#xD;
cept his stomach.&#xD;
Now, Dr. Riproarer had been preaching every night,&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             223&#xD;
for six successive nights, a "big gun" sermon, with a&#xD;
view of getting up a revival. Ben Slocum had been&#xD;
attending these revival-meetings ; and it was but too&#xD;
evident, that upon him an impression had been made,&#xD;
either by the Doctor, or by Miss Sally Fastidious, a&#xD;
young lady whom he took it into his head he was some&#xD;
of these days to mafry, and whom he thought he terri-&#xD;
bly loved, but who, fickle thing, of late received more&#xD;
graciously the attentions of another suitor ; and, for the&#xD;
past six nights, Ben had not had the pleasure of wait-&#xD;
ing on her "to meeting."&#xD;
This was a sore calamity, quite sufficient to cast a&#xD;
young gentleman of Ben's aspirations into the Slough&#xD;
of Despond. Hood's "Happiest Man in all England,"&#xD;
when he plunged into the mud-hole waist deep, was not&#xD;
half so uncomfortable as our unphilosopliical young&#xD;
friend, whose surname by no means afforded an ample&#xD;
key to his character. Mud is good, and may be ap-&#xD;
plied to many useful purposes, but not such a slough as&#xD;
that in which Ben now found himself. There was no-&#xD;
thing at all good in it as to him. Beat it up, spread it out,&#xD;
mould it into the form of bricks, dry it, burn it, cook it,&#xD;
pound it; it was all the same, good for naught to poor Ben.&#xD;
It was a great misfortune, as I believe my Uncle Toby&#xD;
said about the cataplasm, in its connection with Tris-&#xD;
tram, Susan, and Dr. Slops. But we cannot mend the&#xD;
matter. Ben was fairly " cut out."  The young lady&#xD;
had given hin "the sack," or " flat," or whatever else&#xD;
you please to term it. Ben thought it the jumping&#xD;
" flts." Ben was flat enough, that is certain. The age&#xD;
of duelling had not yet dawned upon our world, or per-&#xD;
haps, but for his st omach's sake, Ben might have done&#xD;

something violent. As it was, "prudence" he deemed&#xD;
"the better part of valor." But, poor Ben became very&#xD;
melancholy; it was more than he could well digest,&#xD;
therefore he talked about "getting religion," "doing&#xD;
better," mendingg his ways," "having nothing more&#xD;
to do with women," and a hundred and one other things.,&#xD;
While this unpleasant state of affairs in Ben's his-&#xD;
tory was the theme of discussion at home (he lived with&#xD;
his aunt), Dr. Riproarer paid Mrs. Blenunerton a visit,&#xD;
by way of returning the compliment that she had paid&#xD;
him, in attending his "big-gun" sermons. He under-&#xD;
stood Ben's case decidedly. He knew that lie was&#xD;
"laboring under conviction," to use his own phrase ;&#xD;
for he had all the symptoms of it, he said, as he had&#xD;
often seen them developed. He was greatly concerned&#xD;
in Ben's behalf; and hoped that he should have him as&#xD;
"another seal to his ministry."&#xD;
Query: was it Sally Fastidious, or the eloquence of&#xD;
the Doctor, that had wrought so powerfully on Ben?&#xD;
After the Doctor's departure, Mrs. Blemmerton&#xD;
sought Ben, and said to him: "Ben, my son," (she&#xD;
always called him her son,) "Ben, my son, what ails&#xD;
you? You seem so low-spirited !" Ben did not know&#xD;
what the difficulty was. Thought, perhaps, that his&#xD;
liver was disordered. Had he said stomach, he would&#xD;
have been nearer the mark. "Ben, my son," continued&#xD;
Mrs. B., "you must be under ' conviction.' "  They all&#xD;
were familiar with these phrases, from their frequent&#xD;
attendance on the worship of some one or other of the&#xD;
new lights. You have all the signs of it, as I have&#xD;
heard it described by Dr. Riproarer. Indeed, Dr. Rip-&#xD;
roarer just said so."&#xD;
&#xD;
Ben could not tell; he knew that he felt very badly;&#xD;
but he thought Sally Fastidious a fool, to have any&#xD;
thing to do with that red-headed fellow, Bill Jenkins;&#xD;
and he thought it would be a very good thing if he&#xD;
could "get religion." indeed, lie had half a mind to&#xD;
believe, that Sally Fastidious thought so, too.&#xD;
"Well, Ben, my son, I'll send for Mr. Lovegood, and&#xD;
have him talk with you on the subject."&#xD;
This was beyond Mr. Slocum's comprehension. He&#xD;
could see neither rhyme nor reason in sending for Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood; and he aroused to the startling effort of ask-&#xD;
ing, with surprise. "Why Mr. Lovegood? why not Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer ?"&#xD;
"Because, Ben, my son, you know we are Episcopa-&#xD;
lians, and after you ' get religion' you may join what&#xD;
Church you please. If you do not like Mr. Lovegood,&#xD;
but prefer Dr. Riproarer, why you can join his Church.&#xD;
But if you join Dr. Riproarer's Church without saying&#xD;
any thing to Mr. Lovegood beforehand, he will be of-&#xD;
fended with me, and blame me for it."&#xD;
Ben persisted, that she need not send for Mr. Love-&#xD;
good, declaring that if ihe joined any Church, it would&#xD;
be the Presbyterian! He was, he insisted, bound to be&#xD;
a Presbyterian.&#xD;
Notwithstanding Ben's remoustrances, Mrs. Blem-&#xD;
merton insisted on communicating the important intel-&#xD;
ligence to Mr. Lovegood. There are always wheels&#xD;
within wheels, in this moving world-of ours, and they&#xD;
who do not drive, are often found in harness, pulling&#xD;
along, with all their might and main, the great lumber-&#xD;
ing vehicle, EXPEDIENCY. Or else they are bargaining&#xD;
or bartering for running-gear, and freight to wheel&#xD;

over the turnpike of UTILITARIANISM. This is a cal-&#xD;
culating world ; and Mrs. Blemmerton lived in a cal-&#xD;
culating age, and was in fact a calculating woman.&#xD;
She was, though of course, in the present instance, very&#xD;
religiously disinterested as to a:l personal considerations,&#xD;
apart from the melancholy condition of Mr. Ben Slocum,&#xD;
apt to be found, either driving, or in harness, ready to&#xD;
be driven. Either way, it booted little to her, so that&#xD;
she made a good bargain, a capital hit, or a lucky spec-&#xD;
ulation.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, though with reluctance, obeyed her&#xD;
urgent request, that lie would take the earliest moment&#xD;
to see her on business of importance ; and in due time&#xD;
he madewhc his appearance, at whic time and place the&#xD;
case was duly opened, and Mr. Benjamin Slocum Sa-&#xD;
picsen duwasplaced under his tender pastoral care and&#xD;
' guidance.&#xD;
was a case. Was it one of conscience or casu-&#xD;
istry ? We wot not. Still it was a case as novel as it&#xD;
was rare, and as rare as novel, in the Pastor's experi-&#xD;
ence. There are times and circumstances in a clergy-&#xD;
manl's life, which baffle, and almost set at defiance, all&#xD;
the rules of experience, and the laws of ecclesiastical&#xD;
usage, and which drive him to such resources as, in an&#xD;
emergency, he may call to his aid.&#xD;
For awhile, Mr. Lovegood was bewildered. He&#xD;
scarcely knew what to do with such a case; the case of&#xD;
one seeking to make good his calling and election in&#xD;
the Church of God, in the ways, and through the means,&#xD;
employed by the modern "revivalist" school. It must&#xD;
be told, that Mr. Ben Slocum had been baptized in the&#xD;
Church ; but alas ! for him, he had had no Church-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGs BY THE WAYSIDE.            227&#xD;
training. His baptism passed for nothing, in his esti-&#xD;
mation. According to the notions of some of the sects&#xD;
whose views he had imbibed, or rather picked up,&#xD;
much as a pairrot does the chance words that fall upon&#xD;
his ear, he esteemed his baptism only as the customary&#xD;
mode or fashion of adding the left-hand appendage to&#xD;
his name, Benjamin Slocum; after which, like a bird&#xD;
newly phuned, he came out fully dressed, and made up,&#xD;
whole and singular, Eenjamin Slocum Sapientium, the&#xD;
latter being derived from his father.&#xD;
If the reader doubts whether we give a correct ac-&#xD;
count of the view held by some of the Sects on baptism,&#xD;
let hime visit the land of musquitoes, sunshine, figs,&#xD;
and flowers, and we will put his hand upon a veritable&#xD;
book, that will enlighten his mind on the subject.&#xD;
Mr. Ben Slocum knew nothing about the Church.&#xD;
How could he, when all his notions were picked up by&#xD;
chance at some "meeting-house," (and we hope we&#xD;
shall be pardoned for the use of that word "meeting-&#xD;
house;" for, when a boy, we gave fearful offence by&#xD;
calling a "meeting-house" " church;" we came near&#xD;
getting our ears boxed; we promised never to do so ir-&#xD;
religious a thing again ; and we have endeavored to&#xD;
keep that vow, as sacred as that of an anchorite, in&#xD;
memory of the old lady, who caudleized us,)-or, in&#xD;
and about "Bleminerton House," and of course lie&#xD;
knew nothing about his duties and privileges as a mem-&#xD;
ler' of the Church.&#xD;
What, then, could :Mr. Lovegood do, (and if any one&#xD;
could have done better, we recommend him to do it,&#xD;
should a similar case ever fall across his pathwvay,) but&#xD;
throw him back upon first principles, refer him to his&#xD;

baptism and catechism; which, perhaps, he had never&#xD;
read. He also furnished him with some proper books,&#xD;
and otherwise gave him such general instructions as&#xD;
were calculated to prepare him as a candidate for Con-&#xD;
firmation. And this was Mr. Lovegood's mode of&#xD;
"getting religion" for a young man. Mr. Ben Slocum&#xD;
thought it a slow and laborious process indeed. Like&#xD;
Naaman, he looked for some great thing to be done,-&#xD;
a labor-saving mode; and lo and behold, there was a&#xD;
pile of books to be read, and two or three pages of an&#xD;
old, obsolete catechism actually to be committed to mem-&#xD;
ory. But Mr. Slocumn husbanded his uncomfortable&#xD;
reflections in his own bosom.&#xD;
"And now, Mr. Sapientium," said Mr. Lovegood,&#xD;
"if I understand your case, you desire to become a&#xD;
candidate for Confirmation, to amend your ways, re-&#xD;
nounce your sins, live a Christian life, fulfil your bap-&#xD;
tismal vows and promises, and become a communicant&#xD;
of the Church."  "Exactly so, Sir," said Ben. "I am&#xD;
greatly rejoiced to hear of your determination, and&#xD;
heartily bid you God-speed in it. It will be my pleas-&#xD;
ure, from time to time, to afford you such counsel as&#xD;
may be serviceable to you. It is indeed a beautiful&#xD;
spectacle, one that raises the angelic song of joy in&#xD;
heaven, to behold the young devoting themselves to&#xD;
the Lord's service. I trust you have thought, and will&#xD;
continue to think, on the greatness of the work before&#xD;
you. Read the little books diligently that I have&#xD;
placed in your hands, and make it a point to see me&#xD;
often. 'Be instant in prayer;' for, without earnest&#xD;
prayer, you can make no progress in the divine life;&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
229&#xD;
&#xD;
to become a full-grown Christian in a moment. Your&#xD;
holy spiritual mother, the Church, when she gave you&#xD;
the baptismal waters, pressed you to her heart as her&#xD;
own child, and henceforth recognized in you a member,&#xD;
child, and seivant, of her Lord and Master, who is her&#xD;
head and Fulness. If you have grown up, as I fear&#xD;
you have, a stranger to her patlhs and ways, a stranger&#xD;
to your Heavenly Father's house and home, and, like&#xD;
the poor, wretched, prodigal of the Gospel, have taken&#xD;
your goodly portion into a strange service, and wasted&#xD;
it in sinful and riotous living, like him you must repent&#xD;
of your folly, and return to your Father's arms and love,&#xD;
with the plea, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven,&#xD;
and before Thee, and am no more worthy to be called&#xD;
Thy son.' St. Luke, xv. 18, 19. He will meet you on&#xD;
the way, embrace you, put upon you the best robe of&#xD;
His house, and restore you to His favor and love.&#xD;
" The Church knows nothing of the popular, 'acci-&#xD;
dental' religion of the New Light system. She is&#xD;
sober, sedate, godly, relying rather on 'the fruits of the&#xD;
Spirit,' love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, good-&#xD;
ness, meekness, faith, temperance, than on the feverish&#xD;
emotions of excitable temperaments, for the evidences&#xD;
of a right condition before God. She expects you to&#xD;
grow in grace, in the faithful use of appointed means.&#xD;
Be not, then, I beseech you, carried away by the 're-&#xD;
vival notions' that are prevalent. Seek to be a sober,&#xD;
whole-souled, sound-headed and sound-hearted Chris-&#xD;
tian, in the ways of the Church, which are as old as&#xD;
the Gospel. Be not carried away by an ignis fatuus,&#xD;
but 'hold thee fast' by the true light which burns on&#xD;
the altar of the Church of the living God. We have&#xD;

no confidence in these systems of human contriving; a&#xD;
religion made easy, like modern spelling-books, and&#xD;
'done' in haste, meets not the demands of Scripture.&#xD;
IReligion is a work of instruction, penitence, and holy&#xD;
living, and prayer, and the subjection of the evil in&#xD;
man's heart. Therefore, I trust that you will not allov&#xD;
yourself to be tampered with, by these systems of a few&#xD;
years' age and growth."&#xD;
"No, Sir, by no means, Sir !" Mr. Ben Slocmn had&#xD;
no idea of such a thing ! He had no faith himself in&#xD;
sudden conversions, and as to becoming a Presbyterian,&#xD;
that was quite out of the question. He did not admire&#xD;
Presbyterianism at all.&#xD;
Just now Mr. Slocum might -have been very sincere,&#xD;
although he had made quite a contrary declaration to&#xD;
his aunt. That is, he might, for the moment, have&#xD;
changed his mind, a thing not impossible or improbable&#xD;
in his case ; for Ben was unmistakably a man of idio-&#xD;
syncracies  Be this as it may, Mrs. Blemmerton, who&#xD;
had been listening through the key-hole of the door, in&#xD;
an adjoining room, fearing that Ben was occupying a&#xD;
ticklish position, thought it best, at this juncture, to&#xD;
arrest farther proceedings, by making her appearance.&#xD;
Indeed her patience had grown threadbare ; for she had&#xD;
other weighty and important matters to bring before&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood. And here the conversation between&#xD;
the Pastor and the candidate for Confirmation came to&#xD;
a close, and Mr. Slocum gladly retired. Nor should&#xD;
we be surprised, if he were found before night, in the&#xD;
predicament of another wight whom we wot of, who,&#xD;
to get up an equilibrium in his stomach, (stomach in&#xD;
the present case filling the plce of brains,) lay an&#xD;
&#xD;
umbrella or a broom-handle across the top of a couple&#xD;
of chairs, and amused himself with jumping.over it.&#xD;
This is said to be a charming remedy for gout in the&#xD;
stomach, ennui, blues, or any of their cognates. Jump-&#xD;
ing is always a wholesome exercise, and especially so&#xD;
for any of the foregoing "ills which flesh is heir to."&#xD;
Fancy such a character as Ben Slocum, on a melting&#xD;
day in August, alone in his room, coatless, hatless,&#xD;
bootless, unstrapped, cravatless, with disheveled hair,&#xD;
puffing, snorting, blowing under such a profitable and&#xD;
edifying exercise.&#xD;
-      Mr. Lovegood, who was in no secret, never suspect-&#xD;
ing either Ben's stomach or liver to be in fault, was&#xD;
.really obliged to Mrs..Blemmerton for calling his att.en-&#xD;
tion to him.&#xD;
Mrs. B. was perfectly delighted ; for, though making&#xD;
no pretensions to religion herself, she was very desirous&#xD;
that all her family should be pious, and she really&#xD;
hoped that Ben Slocum would "get through," as Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer said, soon, and "experience religion." She&#xD;
had never "experienced" any thing like "conversion"&#xD;
herself, or even "conviction ;" if she had, she certainly&#xD;
would have improved it; but she supposed her time&#xD;
had not yet come. But from all she had heard Dr.&#xD;
i Riproarer and others say on the subject, she doubted&#xD;
not that the aforesaid Ben was in a fair way.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood expressed surprise and pain at finding&#xD;
one who called herself a Churchwoman, adopting the&#xD;
phrases and notions of the Revivalists. "The Church,"&#xD;
said he, "knows nothing of such dogmas; at best, they&#xD;
only divert the mind from the very essence of true&#xD;
religion, aim to develop a system of 'religion made&#xD;

easy,' and throw out of view practical, working faith,&#xD;
by substituting a flimsy shadow. It is my duty to&#xD;
speak thus to you, Madam, though it be painful. Were&#xD;
my position towards you any other than that of a&#xD;
Pastor, I might withhold my sentiments, perhaps with-&#xD;
out any breach of duty ; for, in a merely conventional&#xD;
point of view, there is a spell, which mankind fear to&#xD;
break, resting over their social intercourse and friend-&#xD;
ships, and the heart is ever loth to trespass, where&#xD;
every transgression is pregnant with humiliation, pain,&#xD;
and grief. But my office raises me above such consid-&#xD;
erations, and compels me to be instant in season or out&#xD;
of season."&#xD;
This went decidedly against the grain; but Mrs.&#xD;
Blemmerton determined to maintain the equanimity of&#xD;
her temper, and therefore contented herself with the&#xD;
observation : " You know we are liberal, Mr. Love-&#xD;
good. And there is Dr. Skyrocket, one of the most&#xD;
popular and eloquent divines we have. He preaches&#xD;
for the Presbyterians and Methodists very often, and&#xD;
would, if he were allowed, I have understood, have&#xD;
their preachers in his pulpit, and surely he cannot&#xD;
think their notions so exceedingly wrong. Indeed I&#xD;
have known him to attend their 'revival meetings;' and,&#xD;
really, I think he enjoyed them as much as any one,&#xD;
and looked as happy. And for our part we think it&#xD;
matters not so much what one believes, or how they&#xD;
'get religion,' so that they get it, and are sincere.&#xD;
This is the opinion of Dr. Riproarer, who is, you are&#xD;
aware, a very learned man ; and I think Dr. Skyrocket&#xD;
must entertain the same opinion. People will differ,&#xD;
you know, Sir. All cannot think alike.",&#xD;

Mr. Lovegood could not answer for the opinion of&#xD;
either of the learned Doctors; they were neither his&#xD;
teachers nor Mrs. Blemmerton's. The Doctors are not&#xD;
infallible, and they would be the first to deny infalli-&#xD;
bility, even to the Church; ergo, they could not claim&#xD;
it for themselves. And yet, with all due deference to&#xD;
their "learned opinions," he was certain that the&#xD;
Church teaches no such notion ; moreover, he was&#xD;
clearly of the opinion, to say the least, that the Church&#xD;
is nearer infallibility than the Doctors, and, conse-&#xD;
quently, less liable to err.&#xD;
"But aside from this, Mrs. Blemmerton," continued&#xD;
he, " is that proposition true? You say you are liberal?&#xD;
Liberal with what? You have a right, and are re-&#xD;
quired, to be liberal with your purse! But where do&#xD;
you learn in Holy Scripture, that you are to liberalize&#xD;
God's immutable Truth, according to your understand-&#xD;
ing of that proposition ? If man made his own religion,&#xD;
then might he liberalize it as he pleased, alter, amend,&#xD;
or dispense with it, at his own discretion. But, religion&#xD;
comes from God, 'the Father of lights, with whom is&#xD;
no variableness, neither shadow of turning.' Chris-&#xD;
tianity descended from heaven, is divinely revealed:&#xD;
what then has man to do, but receive it just as it is&#xD;
given ? It was not given to exercise man's ingenuity,&#xD;
in moulding, or amending, or altering, or adapting it to&#xD;
his own predilections, but to exercise his faith, and train&#xD;
him for the world to come. And he is required to&#xD;
receive, hold, live upon, the Faith, as Christ hath&#xD;
revealed it to His Church, and not on his own terms&#xD;
and he is to be liberal in aiding to dispense it abroad&#xD;
over the world, not in granting indulgences, ac-&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
knowledging error, heresy, or schism, to be the&#xD;
Truth?&#xD;
" And if what you say is true, that it matters not&#xD;
what a man believes, so that he is sincere; then if he&#xD;
be sincere in error, his error becomes to him the truth&#xD;
and by parity of reasoning, on the same principle, it&#xD;
will not matter whether he believes any thing. Is this&#xD;
the 'Gospel Faith ? Is this what the Apostle means,&#xD;
when he charges us to 'contend earnestly for the Faith&#xD;
once delivered unto the Saints?' It cannot be. I&#xD;
doubt not, that there have been good and pious men, in&#xD;
all ages of the world, who were associated with some&#xD;
shade or type of religious error. But will the piety or&#xD;
sincerity of the man make his error the truth?  It&#xD;
cannot, any more than holding the truth intellectually&#xD;
will make the man holy and pious. Suppose a man&#xD;
walks into your parlor to-morrow, seizes a valuable&#xD;
article, and is about to bear it ofi; even before your&#xD;
eyes, would you not say to him, 'Sir, that is my prop-&#xD;
erty, you cannot take possession of it?' And suppose&#xD;
he answers, ' Madam, I sincerely believe it is my right&#xD;
and duty to take this article !' what would you argue&#xD;
his sincerity to be worth, in contrast with the question&#xD;
of right ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton shrugged her shoulders at this, and&#xD;
looked wistfully around on the beautiful ornaments and&#xD;
costly gewgaws that decorated her magnificent parlor.&#xD;
The Pastor had evidently struck a rich and profitable&#xD;
vein.&#xD;
Ile proceeded:-" We republicans hold monarchy to&#xD;
be wrong and tyrannical ; but it does not necessarily&#xD;
follow, that all monarchs are either imipious or tyran-&#xD;

&#xD;
nical. And so in the case before us, we deal with erro-&#xD;
neous systems, not so much with men. And we say the&#xD;
man may be a good man, and yet the religious system&#xD;
to which he may be attached, may be very erroneous,&#xD;
very unsound, in either one or both of two sins, heresy&#xD;
and schism. Does it follow, that he should not re-&#xD;
nounce his false system, or that we should not condemn&#xD;
it? By no means. Truth, justice, charity, require it&#xD;
at our hands, making it our imperative duty, to en-&#xD;
deavor to release him from his error.&#xD;
"It were indeed, then, strange, to say that it matters&#xD;
not what a man believes, when he is required to believe&#xD;
the Truth, and it is the Truth alone that is to make him&#xD;
altogether free. Otherwise, what gain -we by being&#xD;
Christians ? Would you say we had as well be Mo-&#xD;
hammedans or Mormons? You dare not, and yet your&#xD;
proposition leads exactly to such a conclusion !&#xD;
"It is clear, then, Mrs. B., that it does matter what&#xD;
we believe; that a man may be very sincere, and very&#xD;
honest, and yet be in perilous religious error, teaching&#xD;
heresy, and living in schism. And it no more follows,&#xD;
that he should not renounce his system, and its errors, or&#xD;
that we should not condemn it, and endeavor to lead him&#xD;
into the embrace of the truth, than that you should not&#xD;
denounce the man who would rob you of your property,&#xD;
because he sincerely thinks lie ought to take it, or that&#xD;
we should not condemn monarchy, because all mon-&#xD;
archs are not impious and tyrannical.&#xD;
"And see, too, to what this dogma of sincerity, and&#xD;
'it matters not what a man believes,' as the sole guide&#xD;
to the truth, has led, based, as it is, on the broadest&#xD;
ground of the Latitudinarian Private Judgment sys-&#xD;

tem, every man interpreting the Bible as he pleases.&#xD;
Has it not resulted in a multitude of jarring and dis..&#xD;
cordant sects, each boasting, it is true, of its sincerity,&#xD;
which we do not care to question, and yet each opposed&#xD;
to the others, in a greater or less degree, on some vital&#xD;
question of Christian doctrine; each going in a differ-&#xD;
ent path; each holding a different faith in some partic-&#xD;
ular; and yet, stranger still, each holding!your views&#xD;
of an enlarged liberality, each clinging to this doctrine&#xD;
of sincerity, as the talisman of truth.  Your theory,&#xD;
then, must be wrong, or else there is a great amount of&#xD;
insincerity among the multitude of jarring sects. For&#xD;
truth is, and must in its own nature be, a unit; and if&#xD;
SINCERITY is the only test of truth, then it follows, that&#xD;
multitudes must have failed in sincerity ; in other&#xD;
words, must have become wofully insincere, to have&#xD;
produced such an array of opposing and conflicting&#xD;
doctrines.&#xD;
"3And what tower of strength can these contradictory&#xD;
elements raise against any type of heresy or schism,&#xD;
when its founders shall hurl back upon them this doe-&#xD;
trine of sincerity, and inform them, that they have only&#xD;
acted upon their example, done as they have done, in-&#xD;
terpreted the Bible as they pleased, formed a system&#xD;
after their own heart's liking, and claim to be just as&#xD;
sincere ? Upon these contradictions and discrepancies&#xD;
in professed Christian teachers, does Infidelity plant its&#xD;
1oot ; and the hoarse laugh of man's great enemy rings&#xD;
through the earth in triumph. For, what is the infidel's&#xD;
prominent argument ? Does he not point to the mrim.&#xD;
meries of the Riomish Church, and the discordant, op-&#xD;
poing, and fragmentary elements into which the doc-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              237&#xD;
trine of SINCERITY has developed, and ask, in apparent&#xD;
triumph, Are these the signs of a Divine Revelation?&#xD;
Does he not tell you, that professed Christians do not&#xD;
agree, as to what Christianity is, do not agree about&#xD;
the interpretation of the-Bible ? and will they ask him&#xD;
to embrace the teachings of a Book, about which they&#xD;
are so fully disagreed among themselves?, One sect, he&#xD;
says, tells him one thing; another, quite the contrary.&#xD;
ie knows that contraries cannot be true. He knows&#xD;
not which, who, or what to believe, and therefore he&#xD;
ends in believing none, and so nothing ! He has no&#xD;
conception of the truth; makes no effort to ascertain&#xD;
whether there is a mode by which the truth may be&#xD;
elicited. Taught by the latitudinarian school, lie dis-&#xD;
cards the idea of the Church; and, seeing before him&#xD;
nothing but a conflicting array of " churches," he simply&#xD;
discards and rejects the whole, pleading in extenuation&#xD;
the discrepancies between the various religious sects.&#xD;
And hence, we think, are demonstrated two great facts;&#xD;
that both Rome and Sectarianism are aiding, unwit-&#xD;
tingly doubtless, in disseminating or fostering infidelity,&#xD;
and that we who stand between these two great ex-&#xD;
tremes of Christendom, afflicted, tossed, and agitated,&#xD;
by many contentions, should the more 'earnestly con-&#xD;
tend for the, faith which was once delivered unto the&#xD;
saints.' Jude, 3."&#xD;

such matters better than she did. This was at least&#xD;
modest. And she would not dispute the point with&#xD;
him. But she wished to talk with him about Agnes&#xD;
Wallace.  She understood that Mr. Lovegood had&#xD;
adopted her; or, at least, taken her in charge, and de-&#xD;
sired to send her at once to a boarding-school. She&#xD;
was really delighted, that the poor girl had fallen into&#xD;
such excellent hands. From all that she heard, Agnes&#xD;
must be a very promising girl. " ie have been much&#xD;
pleased with her; Mr. Blemmerton especially. 'But,&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, it would be much better for you to get&#xD;
married ; for then you could keep Agnes at home, and&#xD;
send her to Madame Fanciful's school, where Deliah&#xD;
Airmyth and Julia Jasper were educated. Madame&#xD;
Fanciful is a grand hand to educate girls. She makes&#xD;
them so accomplished; and that, you know, is a thing&#xD;
greatly to be desired. It makes girls attractive in so-&#xD;
cietv, and enables them to marry to advantage. And&#xD;
in the case of Agnes this will be highly desirable, since,&#xD;
poor thing, she will have nothing to recommend her in&#xD;
the marriage-inarket, unless she be accomplished."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood never thought about her marrying;&#xD;
and wondered whether girls were made for nothing but&#xD;
to get married.&#xD;
"Now," continued Mrs. B., "there is Deliah Air-&#xD;
myth: she has already had a number of fine offers;&#xD;
but we did not exactly fancy any of them. The truth&#xD;
is, Mr. L., we think Dele cut out for something above&#xD;
the common walks of life. Moreover, you know, she&#xD;
has no occasion to seek a match for wealth : that is a&#xD;
great comfort; for, her father is ready to give her two&#xD;
hundred thousand dollars the day she is married. All&#xD;
&#xD;
she needs is the right one. And I tell Dele the right&#xD;
one will come along after a while; for, I believe certain&#xD;
people are made for each other, as my mother, who al-&#xD;
ways spoke Bible truth, used to tell me, 'Matches are&#xD;
nmlde in Heaven.'&#xD;
Two hundred thousand dollars,-a pretty round sum;&#xD;
quite comfortable in "hard times ;" pretty good that,&#xD;
to, for a poor clergyman. Wonder whether Mr. Love-&#xD;
g od was dumb?    how many poor clergymen would&#xD;
be made happy with the two-hundredth part of it per&#xD;
"While I think of it," said the benevolent lady, "I&#xD;
will just show you a piece of work, Mr. Lovegood, that&#xD;
IDele has made for you, as a New Year's gift,"-laying&#xD;
a very significant stress on "you."&#xD;
It was a velvet sermon holder, with a handsome cross&#xD;
in gold beads, and a wreath beautifully wrought about&#xD;
it on each side. Bringing it in, she continued: " Dele&#xD;
is a girl of taste and judgment; and we are highly&#xD;
pleased to see her take an interest in such matters, and&#xD;
. especially in the Parson. We think it always a token&#xD;
of good taste, to see the young folks take an interest in&#xD;
the clergyman, especially one who is unmarried, for he&#xD;
has no one to prepare such pretty little things for him."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood thought the thing much too fine for him.&#xD;
ie (lid not know what he would do with it.&#xD;
Smile, if you please! But what better could he have&#xD;
aild ?&#xD;
"0 dear, Mr. Lovegood, you must not say so. Dele&#xD;
would cry her eyes out. She thinks nothing fine enough&#xD;
for you. Poor thing, she would sit up all night, and&#xD;
work her fingers to the quick, to make it ten times finer,&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
DxCK-SHOOTING. A WILD-GOOSE CHASE, IN WHICH DR.&#xD;

A WILD-GOOSE chase ! Pshaw, what of it? One half&#xD;
of the world is engaged in just such a chase ; and the&#xD;
other half is either looking on, or helping!&#xD;
But, we opine, it is not half so pleasant as duck-&#xD;
shooting or angling. We never tried a wild-goose chase&#xD;
but once, unless it was when we undertook this quondam&#xD;
/ work of writing Life Experiences,. and then only got&#xD;
terribly scratched and torn with briers, and had a sum-&#xD;
mary " ducking" for our pains.&#xD;
But the most pleasant thing in which we ever en-&#xD;
gaged, was duck-shooting. When we were quite a boy,&#xD;
our father resided near a beautiful, poetic sheet of water;&#xD;
one of those charming rivers which tide up from the&#xD;
noble Chesapeake. This little river sweeps through&#xD;
one of the most productive, highly improved, and at-&#xD;
tractive districts of Maryland. It is a beautiful, wind-&#xD;
ing streak, whose banks are trimmed with majestic&#xD;
oaks, and numerous other forest trees; and ever and&#xD;
anon, as you sail over it, or "glide along in the light&#xD;
canoe," you behold a fine old mansion, standing off in&#xD;
its stateliness, upon some commanding eminence, in,&#xD;
full view of the river, with its time-worn locusts or tall&#xD;
Lombardy poplars, standing around, as so many guards&#xD;
on duty, looking down with apparent disdain on the&#xD;

humbler shrubbery and fruit-trees, which dot the yard,&#xD;
or, in rows, stretch off to the margin of the river.&#xD;
Many a pleasant summer's evening have I sat in my&#xD;
father's bateau, with a company of three or four more&#xD;
alers, under the shadow of some spreading oak, which&#xD;
was cast over the water, seemingly to protect us from&#xD;
the scorching rays of the sun; and there, for hours,&#xD;
have enjoyed the sport which was so congenial to good&#xD;
old Izaak Walton, of blessed " piscatory memory."&#xD;
Al, I remember those days of my boyhood, with&#xD;
mingled emotions of sadness and pleasure. They can&#xD;
never return. They are gone ; and the light-hearted&#xD;
boy, who used to linger about thy waters, noble, placid&#xD;
little river ! lie, too, is gone, far, far away. There is&#xD;
but one scene that surpasses, in my estimation, the&#xD;
charms of this noble little river,-the striking beauties&#xD;
of the Hudson. The Hudson is indeed grander, more&#xD;
majestic and awe-inspiring, but not so charmingly sim-&#xD;
pie and modest.&#xD;
Who has ever passed up the noble Hudson, borne&#xD;
along upon one of her splendid steam-palaces, with&#xD;
heart so callousto the enchanting beauties of nature&#xD;
and art, as not to feel the inspiration of the majestic&#xD;
scenery which, on all sides, greets the eye ? The&#xD;
beautiful village, the exquisite cottage, the granite hill,&#xD;
the mimic and picturesque mountain the blue outline&#xD;
of the Catskill, towering in the distance, and almost&#xD;
seeming to kiss the sky, the elegant summer residence,&#xD;
with its sloping lawn carpeted in green, dropping down&#xD;
to the water's edge, and ending in the bewiteling bower,&#xD;
where oft at twilight the gentle zephyr, as it comes,&#xD;
playfully in its frolic over the water, laden with cool-&#xD;

ness and balm, from   mountain, shrub, or flower, fans&#xD;
the brow of beauty, or listens to the tale of love: these,&#xD;
one by one, as they are passed by the admiring, enrap-&#xD;
tured stranger, present a scene, for variety, picturesque-&#xD;
ness, and hallowing meditations, of surpassing loveli.&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
To be appreciated, however, its scenery must be en-&#xD;
joyed, in the full blooming and gushing spring-time,&#xD;
when the icy grasp of winter is relaxed, and Nature&#xD;
has robed herself in her most beautiful garments of&#xD;
greensward and of flower. It is then that the heart,&#xD;
keenly alive to the charms of creation, will feel the&#xD;
inspiration of nature, as on all sides it beholds the to-&#xD;
kens of Infinite Love, the foot-print of the All-wise,&#xD;
"Who hath so done His marvellous works, that through&#xD;
them He speaketh."&#xD;
Second only to this, art thou, modest, beautiful little&#xD;
river of my childhood ! Would that I could greet thee&#xD;
again, with a cheerful song of loves!&#xD;
I will not say to thee farewell!&#xD;
My faint heart could not bear it well;&#xD;
Its wonted use the tongue withholds,&#xD;
The eye thy beauties still beholds,&#xD;
And fondly yearning o'er the past,&#xD;
I hope to greet thee at the last !&#xD;
When life's poor thread is waxing weak,&#xD;
Thy glowing beauties let me seek,&#xD;
And still, as in the days gone by,&#xD;
On thy bosom let me lie;&#xD;
And then, life's journey being o'er,&#xD;
Let me find the heavenly shore !&#xD;

o'er the heart, will arise. The cloud will pass away,&#xD;
and the sunshine come again. Well, duck-shooting!&#xD;
There were four of us, who all were good shots "on the&#xD;
wing." Our fathers and grandfathers used to crawl&#xD;
about in ambush along the river's bank, endeavoring to&#xD;
steal upon the ducks of their day. But, in course of&#xD;
time, in a progressive age, ducks, like men, grew in&#xD;
wisdom, and were not to be caught in that way. And&#xD;
we younger ones imitated them; and what our fore-&#xD;
fathers never dreamed of, any more than they did of&#xD;
the steam-horse or telegraphic wires, we brought to&#xD;
perfection.&#xD;
About four o'clock, on a sharp, wintry morning, Sam,&#xD;
the colored boy, who enjoyed the employment fully as&#xD;
much as any of us, would "hamp" the old mule, Jake,&#xD;
and hitch him to the cart, (sleigh, if there happened&#xD;
to be snow enough ;) and, fully provided with ham,&#xD;
bread, coffee, sugar, a frying-pan, and a coffee-boiler&#xD;
we jumped in, with guns, ammunition, etc., not forget-&#xD;
ting the tinder-box,-for mankind had not then grown&#xD;
wise enough to make lucifer matches,-(a bad name, by&#xD;
the by,) and a supply of provender for old Jake, away&#xD;
we drove for the river.&#xD;
We always made for the neighborhood of a fine&#xD;
spring, on a creek ; a little way in the woods, we stop-&#xD;
ped our mule and cart, and, leaving them in the care of&#xD;
Sam, by daylight we had our posts, on some convenient&#xD;
point or bar, past which the ducks must fly, to enter the&#xD;
creek, in pursuit of their morning meal. Alas! I&#xD;
think of it now with sadness ; for, it seems cruel to&#xD;
have thus circumvented the innocent creatures, in their&#xD;
lawful and necessary pursuits. Still it was no worse&#xD;

244 THE BLEMMEItTONS; OR,&#xD;

f&#xD;
&#xD;
than the mean, skulking plan of our forefathers ; and&#xD;
this is some consolation. Moreover, there is little doubt&#xD;
that ducks were made to be eaten, and are not to be&#xD;
caught alive ; if they were, eating them alive or raw&#xD;
would not have been exceedingly pleasant. So we&#xD;
salve our consciences, on the score of many palpable&#xD;
offences,; and why not on that of duck-shooting? 0,&#xD;
ye simpering philosophers, you may eat as many things&#xD;
alive and raw as ye list; bt, give us ducks well baked&#xD;
and roasted, if you please, with the feathers off.&#xD;
Presently, bang-bang! You would hear the sharp&#xD;
report of a gun or two; and down would tumble into&#xD;
the water as many ducks,-for we rarely missed. Old&#xD;
Towser would swim in and bring them out. 0, how&#xD;
he enjoyed it! It was to him and Sam, who would&#xD;
often be pressing through the, bushes, "the feast of&#xD;
reason and the flow of soul."&#xD;
By the time we could re-load our pieces, the process&#xD;
would be repeated.   And now   the breakfast hour&#xD;
arrives. By this time, Sam has a fine fire sparkling&#xD;
and crackling in the morning frost; we retire to it,&#xD;
thaw our frozen fingers, (unthaw, as Sam always would&#xD;
say,)lay our ducks away in the cart, fry our 'ham, make&#xD;
our coffee, and take breakfast.&#xD;
Breakfast over, then for the ducks again. But, by&#xD;
this time, taking advantage of our absence, the creek&#xD;
above us is pretty full, and very few are flying in.&#xD;
This -renders it necessary to change the process. Ac-&#xD;
cordingly, Sam is started up the creek; and presently&#xD;
you hear him screaming at the top of his voice, and&#xD;
threshing the bushes as lustily as if he had found a&#xD;
den of grizzly bears, and were endeavoring to frighten&#xD;

246        THEi BLEMMERToNS; OR,&#xD;
them off. And why not frighten bears by such a pro-&#xD;
cess? Periander, of Corinth, one of the Seven Sages of&#xD;
Greece, according to ancient story, "scowled back the&#xD;
advance of a leopard !" and, for aught that we know,&#xD;
screamed at him. A similar story is told of the whole&#xD;
Seven. And had our Sam met a gang of bears, at this&#xD;
time, we think they would have retreated right lustily.&#xD;
The ducks did. Up they bounced, and away they flew,&#xD;
as fast as wings could carry them; but, not too fast for&#xD;
our shot ; bang--bang-bang-as they passed us, and&#xD;
down they tumbled !   When their fright was over,&#xD;
they began to fly in again ; and then the process is&#xD;
repeated, until dinner-time. Then we pause. Sam&#xD;
goes out in a canoe ; and, with a pair of oyster-rakes,&#xD;
soon secures a few bushels of fine oysters. These are&#xD;
roasted on the fire; and we make a sumptuous dinner.&#xD;
So the day is passed. Towards night, we have a large&#xD;
supply of mallards, red-heads, canvas-backs, and as&#xD;
many oysters as we desired, stowed away in the cart:&#xD;
and then for home.   This is duck-shooting in the&#xD;
medieval periods of our life. How it is now, we wot&#xD;
not. In an age of steam, there have been, perhaps,&#xD;
many remarkable improvements. Man is a wonderful&#xD;
being, always making improvements and discoveries.&#xD;
And we understand, that our plan has been improved&#xD;
upon, like many other things; ducks are baited and&#xD;
caught in a net.&#xD;
But what of the wild-goose chase ? Ask your par-&#xD;
don ! James Fastidious had been on one for a year&#xD;
past ; for, he had been just that long chasing downto&#xD;
Dr. Rtiproarer's Sunday-School. You remember, that&#xD;
the mother of the aforesaid James persisted in taking&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             247&#xD;
him from the Sunday-School of the Church, because,&#xD;
forsooth, Mr. Lovegood had crossed her notions of&#xD;
clerical propriety.&#xD;
Now James had never been pleased with this ar-&#xD;
rangement; (who would be?) and, having grown a&#xD;
year older, and a year nearer his own mastership, pos-&#xD;
sessed, too, perhaps, of a sprinkle more of the spirit of&#xD;
" Young America," he had determined to bring about&#xD;
a change, and take himself back to his old quarters.&#xD;
It must be named, also, as we pass along, that through&#xD;
the interference of several malcontents, some twenty&#xD;
other boys had been taken from the Sunday-School of&#xD;
the Church, and sent to Dr. Riproarer's.&#xD;
Now, about a year after the occurrence of these&#xD;
events, a remarkable thing occurred one Sunday morn-&#xD;
ing, which filled Dr. Riproarer, and all the good mem-&#xD;
bers of his Sunday-School, with dismay.&#xD;
A fashion had grown up among the boys about town,&#xD;
-boys are progressive, you know, and change their&#xD;
modes of enjoyment and amusement very often, one&#xD;
week we have marbles, then ball, then bandy, then&#xD;
cricket, and kites, etc.-of forming mimc military&#xD;
companies. Every Saturday, they assembled in the&#xD;
suburbs of the city, and passed through the evolutions&#xD;
and exercises of a military drill. And it must be said,&#xD;
to their credit, however we may disapprove of the&#xD;
principle or practice, that they performed their parts, m&#xD;
a highly creditable and soldier-like manner.&#xD;
It happened, that James Fastidious was the captain&#xD;
of one of these juvenile military companies, which was&#xD;
composed, in part, of the twenty boys, who, against&#xD;
their wishes, had been sent to (as they persisted in call-&#xD;

ing him) Dr. Rip's school. On the Sunday morning&#xD;
alluded to above, to Dr. Rip's consternation, as he drew&#xD;
near his meeting-house, what should he behold, but&#xD;
James Fastidious, and his twenty little soldiers, all mar-,&#xD;
shalled in order, on the pavement before the door.&#xD;
"What can it mean,!" ejaculated Dr. Rip.  "Are&#xD;
these boys crazy ?"  "Right about ! face !-single file !&#xD;
forward ! march !" says Captain Fastidious; and away&#xD;
they go, in the direction of St.  's Church. And&#xD;
poor Dr. Rip trots after them, in painful suspense, and&#xD;
breathless anxiety. "Boys! boys !" exclaimed he,&#xD;
"what is the matter ? This is the Lord's-Day. You&#xD;
can't march to-day. You'll bring disgrace on my Sun-&#xD;
day-School."  "Halt !" says Captain Fastidious.&#xD;
"With all due respect for you, Dr. Riproarer, we&#xD;
must say to you, that we are "-soldiers of Christ,' and&#xD;
are only marching to our headquarters, our spiritual&#xD;
mother's home; and we know not that it is any more&#xD;
sinful to go there in a body, than singly; we are only&#xD;
walking. Baptized into the folds of the Church, we&#xD;
think we have a right to her teaching, training, and the&#xD;
blessed privileges of our baptism. It is in the Lord's&#xD;
service that we are engaged, therefore you will please&#xD;
excuse us.  Forward! march !"   And so they did&#xD;
march directly to St. .- 's Sunday-School.&#xD;
"Well, well," quoth Dr. Riproarer, " what's the&#xD;
world coining to ? Either to an end, or to the Millen-&#xD;
nium."&#xD;
Mrs. Fastidious, as might have been anticipated, was&#xD;
highly incensed, and censured Mr. Lovegood for the&#xD;
whole transaction. But, as in numerous other cases, lie&#xD;
was unjustly censured or accused. His first intelligence&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
249&#xD;
&#xD;
of the proceeding, was when the boys presented them-&#xD;
selves at the door of the Sunday-School, for admission.&#xD;
And then he informed them, that their parents .must be&#xD;
consulted. On Mrs. Nochurch it had the effect to pro-&#xD;
duce a fainting-fit. Mrs. Blemmerton thought, that&#xD;
those children had been badly "raised," and could&#xD;
never come to any good end. Mr. Blemmerton thought&#xD;
it high time to be looking after boys; there was too&#xD;
much of "Young America" in it for him. Mrs. Pres-&#xD;
byterian thought it a disgrace, and exceedingly unchar-&#xD;
itable, and illiberal, and bigoted. Aunt Sally Milk-&#xD;
and-water declared, that children did not behave, now-&#xD;
a-days, as they did when she was young.&#xD;
Notwithstanding all the hard speeches and remon-&#xD;
strances which so remarkable a transaction produced,&#xD;
d -th fthes ndmo-&#xD;
the boys maintained their ground thefathers andrmo-&#xD;
thers acquiesced, not very graciously to be sure; an&#xD;
these unseemly scape-goats, as so many considered them,&#xD;
grew up under Mr. Lovegood's pastorate; and, at the&#xD;
present day, many of them are adorning the Christian&#xD;
life and character : one is in the Church's ministry, a&#xD;
faithful and efficient man; and the rest, grown to man's&#xD;
estate, are filling honorable positions in the world, and.&#xD;
performing a noble part, in their several spheres, as lay-&#xD;
men in the Church.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
KITE-FLYING. A FLASH-SCHOOL.&#xD;
KITES! I never knew how to make a kite, though I&#xD;
have flown them often. Kites are of various kinds.&#xD;
Some have wings; and some have none. Some have&#xD;
tails, but are wingless. Some have neither tails nor&#xD;
wings; and on these last there "hangs a tale."  There&#xD;
is a kite of the bird tribe: this is a kite of prey. There&#xD;
is a kite made of paper; this is of the flying tribe, but&#xD;
has no wings, while it boasts of a long tail. And there&#xD;
ishe kite written on paper ; these are men's kites, and&#xD;
are of the utilitarian tribe.&#xD;
To give you an idea of this last genus of the kite&#xD;
tribe, take the following as an illustration. A. is press-&#xD;
ed for the wherewithal to pay his note in bank, and&#xD;
draws through his bank, at sight, on B., in a neighbor-&#xD;
ing city, and sends him, per mail, a check back on the&#xD;
bank that negotiated his draft on B. B. pays A.'s draft&#xD;
with this check when it is presented, which in due time&#xD;
is returned to A.'s bank, by which time A. has the&#xD;
money there to meet it. This system of operating gives&#xD;
A. some six or eight more days in which to provide the&#xD;
money.&#xD;
This is a kite of the banking genus; and there is a&#xD;
good deal of utility in it. Banks are useful things. At&#xD;
least A. thinks so. Some call this style of kiting sky-&#xD;
rocketino'; but we believe that we have given it the best&#xD;
&#xD;

It is a high-flying affair. And often a&#xD;
name-kiting'.  t1  ihfyn xa  ep u This   abe&#xD;
good "wind" is required to keep it up.  is may e&#xD;
taken as one illustration of "raising the wind.&#xD;
Now there are many kites of this kind flown. The&#xD;
advertising columns of newspapers are, for the most&#xD;
art, filled with just such kites; high-flying produc-&#xD;
tion  that cannot float without wind. Gas, indeedis&#xD;
good for some of them. Indeed, in an " age of steam,&#xD;
kites and gas seen to be necessary.&#xD;
The world is full of kite-flyers. Men and women are&#xD;
only children on a larger scale; and, winle boys f&#xD;

&#xD;
THE BLEMMERToNs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
In Mr. Lovegood's day, not far from the city of&#xD;
there lived a portrait painter, whose name was Jeremy&#xD;
i(iteflyer; an excellent name, and apropos at that day;&#xD;
for, the flying of kites was just then coming into vogue .&#xD;
And Jeremy, having spent a large amount of money in&#xD;
paints and oils to no profit, not to speak of labor, giving&#xD;
up in despair, determined to try another mode of kite-&#xD;
flying. Indeed, it was said by some of the spiteful&#xD;
ones,-of whom the world is full, shame on them, that&#xD;
the aforesaid Jeremy had missed his occupation, or,&#xD;
rather, like Othello, had lost it ; for his paintings did&#xD;
not take. They were always overwrought or under-,&#xD;
wrought; they flew too high, or too low. Now, who&#xD;
does not know, that a painting cannot fly, not having&#xD;
wings? 'But when a lady, possessed, in her own esti-&#xD;
nation, or otherwise, of a beautiful aquiline nose, sat&#xD;
under Jeremy's pencil, and came out all over a regular&#xD;
"pug," who could blame her for "flying into a tem-&#xD;
per," and declaring that he was better fitted for flying&#xD;
kites than painting likenesses.&#xD;
Poor Jeremy! he was in an "evil case," and found&#xD;
it impossible to please every body. "Madam, it is an&#xD;
exact and charming likeness. Just look at the charm-&#xD;
ing expression of countenance. See that lip, Madam,&#xD;
and eye ; how they disclose the glowing thoughts of&#xD;
the mind and heart !"  "La! Sir,-take the ugly daub&#xD;
away: I can't endure it. Look at that pug nose, Sir,&#xD;
if you please, and say, was I ever as ugly as that ?&#xD;
Away with it, Sir! Charming eye, indeed! a half-&#xD;
open, squinting, blearing thing; and lips, as though&#xD;
they had been burnt by a hot coal of fire, and were&#xD;
drawn asunder by the process."&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
253&#xD;
&#xD;
Perhaps the ladies were at fault, and only desired&#xD;
Jeremy to "flatter them," as a very charming little&#xD;
feminine daguerreotypist once said to your ugly scribe:&#xD;
"How do you like it, Sir ?" " O, Madam, it is much&#xD;
too good looking! The thing is over-done."  "0, Sir,&#xD;
I beg your pardon; we are true to nature. We never&#xD;
flatter." And this, with all the grace of a Venus. She&#xD;
was a regular kite-flyer: so you would say, if you should&#xD;
ever see the likeness and the original. But, for aught&#xD;
that we know, this was a thing that Jeremy was too&#xD;
conscientious to do. His glorious Art was at stake;&#xD;
and that he could never think of sacrificing to "the&#xD;
whimsies of the fair sex," as he used to say. At all&#xD;
events, Jeremy came to the conclusion, that the world&#xD;
would never appreciate his talents in that line. And&#xD;
he was not alone ; for did not an ungrateful world serve&#xD;
the great Hlaydon in the same way, who all his life de-&#xD;
voted his almost inspired genius to grand historical&#xD;
paintings, without being appreciated? Let this com-&#xD;
fort the memory of poor Jeremy Kiteflyer.&#xD;
But Jeremy was a man of resources ; and not to be&#xD;
outdone by a few " captious women," as he called them.&#xD;
He would yet make his mark on the world; hand his&#xD;
name down to posterity; and what was denied him in&#xD;
life, he would, like that great model, Haydon, receive&#xD;
in death.&#xD;

Know all MEN and LADIES, by these presents, hav-&#xD;
ing DAUGHTERs to be educated, throughout "the wide&#xD;
world," that the great undertaking has at last been&#xD;
entered upon ! Professor Jeremy Kiteflyer, A. M.,&#xD;
has the pleasure of announcing that, at a vast ex-&#xD;
pense, he has fitted up, and opened a Seminary for&#xD;
Young Ladies, of the highest possible order, at&#xD;
that world-wide celebrated place, Kiteflying Vil-&#xD;
lage!!&#xD;
Every thing will be taught at this school that is&#xD;
of service to mankind in general, or womankind&#xD;
in particular: French, German, Spanish, Italian,&#xD;
Hebrew, Sanscrit, Arabic, Chaldaic, African, Hot-&#xD;
tentot, Chinese, Timbooctan, Choctaw, Chickasaw,&#xD;
Cherokee, Norwegian, Latin, Greek, Irish, Scotch,&#xD;
etc., etc.! Also, all styles of Painting, Drawing,&#xD;
Dancing, Singing, and Instrumental Music, Organ,&#xD;
Piano, Guitar, Harp, Cymbal, Flute, Fife, Fiddle,&#xD;
Tamborine, Banjo, Hand-Organ, Jew's-harp,Whist-&#xD;
ling, etc., etc. And also all the sciences, from the&#xD;
composition of the most delicate colorings in a&#xD;
butterfly's wing, to the most abstruse calculations&#xD;
in logarithms!&#xD;
Parents may rely upon it, that now is tle time&#xD;
for them to give their daughters an accomplished&#xD;
education, never before beard of in this country or&#xD;
any other.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;

&#xD;
The Faculty will be composed of the best Pro-&#xD;
fessors the whole globe can produce. No pains&#xD;
will be spared, to accomplish much more than we&#xD;
proni se.&#xD;
A happy feature in this school, and one well&#xD;
calculated to make it popular, is, that the Princi-&#xD;
pal, having in view the well-being of his pupils,&#xD;
has rented pews in all the principal churches in the&#xD;
village ; and they will enjoy the privilege of hear-&#xD;
ing some of the most eloquent and popular preach-&#xD;
ers of the day. And what is better, they can attend&#xD;
what "Church" they please.   Being an Episco-&#xD;
palian himself, he makes a loud appeal to all other&#xD;
Episcopalians, to aid him in this laudable design&#xD;
of conducting a thorough Church School.&#xD;
Moreover, the Principal has been at the extra-&#xD;
ordinary expense, (a thing never before heard of&#xD;
in any school,) of securing an ample supply of&#xD;
all the celebrated mineral spring waters in this&#xD;
country, for the use of his pupils, etc., etc.&#xD;
Poor innocent girls! Ye were indeed liberally pro-&#xD;
vided for, in the days of Mr. Jeremy Kiteflyer. We&#xD;
have no such schools now: more's the pity. This is a&#xD;
meager, money-making age ; its spirit is too dwarfish,&#xD;
to launch out on such a magnificent scale. Poor inno-&#xD;
cent girls ! did ye not need mineral water, to brace the&#xD;
nerves, when ye got into Hottentot ? So the world&#xD;
went, in Jeremy's day!&#xD;
Mrs. Inquisitive,-bless her pestiferous soul, who had&#xD;

and she desired very much to know, how he got that&#xD;

as she said, to his name.&#xD;
"ft's just like them," quoth Jeremy; "they gave me&#xD;
no peace when I was painting portraits; and I sup-&#xD;
pose they never will. Bless the pestiferous woman !&#xD;
Madam, is not PAINTING one of the Arts; aye, one of&#xD;
the fine Arts? And am not I a painter? (as the great&#xD;
Correggio or Michael Angelo once exclaimed, 'I also&#xD;
am a painter !') And does not that, Madam, constitute&#xD;

Whew! Jeremy! what a mighty kite you are flying!&#xD;
See how it sails up in the ether. Admire its long,&#xD;
comet-like tail. See how boldly and grandly it floats&#xD;
above. That tail is dangerous. What would become&#xD;

Jerry's school was a liberal Church School; very&#xD;
liberal indeed ! It was magnanimous !&#xD;
And when his card duly made its appearance in the&#xD;
papers, the thoughtful Mrs. Blemmerton declared,&#xD;
(Jeremy was a distant relative of hers, and whatever&#xD;
other acts of benevolence the lady performed, she had&#xD;
the good trait of always being on the look-out for her&#xD;
poor relatives; for she said, she did not want them to&#xD;
come upon her purse; she had otherwise as many&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTIN GS BY T HE W AYsIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
257&#xD;
&#xD;
charities as she could attend to,) having before her eyes&#xD;
the future prospects of Agnes Wallace, "That if Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood was not just now ready to marry, the next&#xD;
best thing he could do with dear little Agnes, would be&#xD;
to send her forthwith to Jeremy Kiteflyer's school, until&#xD;
siich time as he did marry, when he could bring her&#xD;
home, and send her to Madame Fanciful to finish off."&#xD;
One of those customary Mulligatawny meetings dis-&#xD;
cussed the question. Mrs. Fastidious thought it just the&#xD;
thing. Mrs. Fussy, Mrs. Nochurch, "and the rest," as&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton termed them, agreed to the very&#xD;
letter. Aunt Sally wished, from the bottom of her&#xD;
heart, there had been such a school in her younger&#xD;
days. Had there been, she was sure she would never&#xD;
have married Mr. Milk-and-water. As it was, she came&#xD;
very near marrying General Crookedlegs,-she was a&#xD;
great belle in her younger days,-only, and it was a&#xD;
great pity, she was not enough "eicated ."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was duly waited upon, and his atten-&#xD;
tion called to the aforesaid grandiloquent advertisement.&#xD;
The committee of ladies thought it quite the thing. "It&#xD;
was to be a good, liberal, Christian school; every thing&#xD;
in general in religion was to be taught, nothing in par-&#xD;
ticular."  And, best of all, Mr. and Mrs. Kiteflyer&#xD;
were both Episcopalians; and they doubted not Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood would prefer an Episcopal school for Agnes.&#xD;
Therefore they had resolved, that it was their duty to&#xD;
confer upon him the favor of calling his attention to&#xD;
Mr. Kiteflyer's card.&#xD;

258        THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
me, Ladies. I could never be induced to recognize that&#xD;
as a Church School. I see not the first element of the&#xD;
Church in it. I call the whole thing, from beginning&#xD;
to end, a cool humbug."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was plain-spoken, that must be granted.&#xD;
Dear me! Mrs. Fastidious thought it so strange !&#xD;
All the ladies were similarly afflicted with amazement.&#xD;
They took great interest in poor little Ages. Here&#xD;
was a school of the first class. It was an age of im-&#xD;
prbvement ; and here was an improved school, com-&#xD;
bining all the wisdom of past ages, and the improve-&#xD;
ments of the present. How they wished they had&#xD;
daughters young enough to send ! But, they supposed&#xD;
they must yield. They hoped, however, that Mr. Love-&#xD;
good would not send the poor little thing to an " old&#xD;
fogy" school. It would be such an immense pity.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, with all his heart, wished that some&#xD;
people had brains sufficient, at least, to attend to their&#xD;
own business, and leave him in the enjoyment of the&#xD;
same delightful privilege.&#xD;
But, one would have supposed that, after his long ex-&#xD;
perience, he would ere this have learned the salutary&#xD;
and becoming lesson, that he was not a free man, that&#xD;
his business was not his own. What right had he to do&#xD;
any thing, without the consent and approbation of all&#xD;
his flock? Was he not hired by them? Did they not&#xD;
support him? Did not Mr. Blemmerton PaY one hun-&#xD;
dred dollars, to get a pew among "the upper tens ?"&#xD;
And did not Mrs. Fastidious and Mrs. Noclrch each&#xD;
pay fifty dollars, to get one only a notch lower? Was&#xD;
it not with their money, that he was going to pay for&#xD;
the schooling of Agnes ? And had they not the right&#xD;

to say where she should be sent? How preposterous&#xD;
was it, then, that these ladies should be deprived of the&#xD;
just and equitable privilege of directing the future of&#xD;
young Agnes's life! How preposterous, for Mr. Love-&#xD;
good to think of having every thing his own way !&#xD;
It all came of his being a pesty-testy, high and dry,&#xD;
self-willed old bachelor. You might as well undertake to&#xD;
control a wild mustang. The thing is impossible. You&#xD;
have first to noose him, then give him the rope, and let&#xD;
him play around till he is fairly broken down; then&#xD;
you have gently to approach him, holding out the&#xD;
tempting morsel of grass,-corn will not answer, for he&#xD;
does not know what it is; then, when he gets a taste of it,&#xD;
you are to coax him; then, if you can get near enough,&#xD;
you are to stroke him, and pat him easily and tenderly&#xD;
on the shoulder,-take care ! stand off! he kicks, as we&#xD;
may suppose old Sisyphus did when his stone rolled&#xD;
down the hill in spite of him !-and then, if you can,&#xD;
you are to throw a blanket on him; and then mount-&#xD;
him if you can ; and then,-look out for your neck. It&#xD;
all comes of being an old bachelor.&#xD;
As Aunt Sally would say, in one of her happiest so-&#xD;
liloquies : " It takes all sorts of people to make a world ;&#xD;
and a great many sorts to make an assortment !"&#xD;
And Mr. Lovegood was doubtless one of these. The&#xD;
ladies could neither tame, nor manage, nor guide him.&#xD;
What he did, will be seen in due time. Meantime, we&#xD;
invite your attention to another scene, which will be&#xD;
charmingly agreeable, provided-it be a hot day ; if oth-&#xD;
erwise, you will enjoy it in prospect.&#xD;
But, first, we will look in upon a CHURCH ScrooL;&#xD;
not a pretension.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
A CHURCH-SCHOOL. HAPPY GIRLS. PLEASANT SCENES.&#xD;
IT is summer ; charming beautiful summer ! The&#xD;
heart leaps up, and delights to be alone, to revel in its&#xD;
musings, to meditate with Isaac at eventide ; or, to note&#xD;
the parting rays of the setting sun, painting, as it were,&#xD;
the robes of Jehovah, in the evening cloud, or writing'&#xD;
His glory across the sky.&#xD;
You miust go into the country, if you would see the&#xD;
beauties of summer : the birds, twittering in the forest;&#xD;
the cattle, " winding o'er the lea ;" the insects, chirp-&#xD;
ing in the grass ; the waving fields of corn; the flow-&#xD;
ers leaping into life; all Nature, pouring forth her&#xD;
tribute to man and beast, and glorifying Nature's God.&#xD;
Ah! these are the sights that make man's heart laugh,&#xD;
and sing, and give thanks.&#xD;
Go with us then, reader, if you delight in the inno-&#xD;
cent, the enchanting, the beautiful, into the free open&#xD;
country.&#xD;
In a beautiful rolling district, far removed from the&#xD;
whirl and bustle of a great city and the thunder even of&#xD;
the steam-horse, there stood upon a commanding emi-&#xD;
nence, at the period of which we write, in its solemn&#xD;
quietude, embowered amid its spreading shade-trees, a&#xD;
nurturing home for the daughters of the Church; a&#xD;
school of the truest, highest type of what a " Church-&#xD;
school" ought to be.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a charming spot; and as sanctified as beau-&#xD;
tiful. Wealth, industry, and refined taste had united&#xD;
to render the surrounding country one of the most&#xD;
flourishing and attractive anywhere to be seen!*&#xD;
The grounds attached to the seminary buildings were&#xD;
amjle, well laid off, and adorned with choice shrubbery ;&#xD;
consequently, they were admirably calculated for two&#xD;
important elements in the proper conduct of such an in-&#xD;
stitution: exercise, and mental and spiritual improve-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
We all know something of the influence of the beau-&#xD;
tiful in nature, in forming the taste of the young, and&#xD;
ennobling the mind. The little flowers blooming at&#xD;
our feet, and regaling the air we breathe, are so many&#xD;
full-voiced messengers from heaven, teaching us les-&#xD;
sons of gentleness, purity, and love.&#xD;
The young imbibe these lessons with ease ; it is in&#xD;
harmony with their nature, which loves to look upon&#xD;
the beautiful; and, if aptly trained, the lessons so im-&#xD;
bibed will be developed in that glowing piety, which,&#xD;
in every bursting bud and opening flower, seeth the&#xD;
hand divine which lavisheth beauty on all things here&#xD;
below.&#xD;
The discipline and management of this school, were&#xD;
of the highest order. HoME and SCHooL Were so hap-&#xD;
pily blended, that the joyous, sanctified HOME FEELING&#xD;
was fully preserved, while the mind of the pupil was&#xD;
imbued with that mental and religious training, which&#xD;
fitted her for time and eternity.&#xD;
e The writer has, in this small sketch, drawn a few thoughts from&#xD;
an article of his in " The Banner of the Cross," Feb. 15, 1851.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Densmore, the Principal of the Institution, had&#xD;
had great experience in training and developing the&#xD;
youthful mind and heart. Possessing, as she did, to a very&#xD;
high degree, those qualifications which adorn the head-&#xD;
hip of such a work, she was eminently worthy of the con-&#xD;
fidence and patronage of the Church. And if to her&#xD;
rare gifts as a teacher and conductor of such a school,&#xD;
we add those of the thorough, faithful, devoted Church-&#xD;
woman, of richly cultivated mind, of grace, piety, and&#xD;
sterling Christian worth, manifested, not in the way of&#xD;
a sickly, morbid sentimentality, which promises with-&#xD;
out doing, but, in the quiet, sober, steady, yet deep,&#xD;
practical way of the Gospel, fully apprehended and.&#xD;
meekly received, as the Church hath gathered the&#xD;
same out of Holy Writ, and embodied it in her teach-&#xD;
ings in the Prayer-Book, we certainly have all that can&#xD;
reasonably be desired, in one who is to train the daugh-&#xD;
ters of the Church for their sphere on earth, and for that&#xD;
higher and holier sphere, in which they are to move&#xD;
when earth and earthly things shall be no more. Here,&#xD;
the influence of the Church was constantly brought to&#xD;
bear on the pupils. They were trained indeed for the&#xD;
Church; Church teaching formed a prominent part of&#xD;
their daily instruction. No girl left Mrs. Densmore,&#xD;
without understanding, appreciating, and loving her&#xD;
spiritual mother.&#xD;
A worthy and efficient chaplain, a beautiful Gothic&#xD;
chapel, lifting toward heaven its humble tower ; with&#xD;
its rich, chaste, emblematic chancel window, as perfect&#xD;
a gem in architecture as that period produces; the mel-&#xD;
low-toned organ, the daily service of prayer and praise:&#xD;
these all united in training the young hearts commit-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.                   263&#xD;
ted to Mrs. Densmore, for the glories of the Church tri-&#xD;
umphant.&#xD;
It was a home, in which heart and mind were duly&#xD;
cultivated, by a course of education embracing the&#xD;
godly, the solid, and the refined. Indeed, there was a&#xD;
directness, practicalness, and reality about every thing&#xD;
at this school, that captivated, not only the pupils, but&#xD;
the friends of sound Church education everywhere.&#xD;
And this, because it was ruled by love. There were no&#xD;
noisy pretensions; there was no kite-flying ; nothing&#xD;
was done by halves; it was what it professed to be, a&#xD;
real " Church School."&#xD;
On1 a pleasant evening in June, 18-, had you, about&#xD;
twilight, passed this quiet nursing-school of the young,&#xD;
you would have heard soft enchanting music from hap-&#xD;
py voices, accompanying the piano at which Mother&#xD;
. Densnore, as the girls all called her, presided, floating&#xD;
on the still air. These are the words of the happy glee-&#xD;
song that you would have heard:&#xD;
o we are happy, we are bright,&#xD;
And now we sing; our hearts are light,&#xD;
Toil is o'er, the task is done ;&#xD;
Of care and sorrow we have none.&#xD;
Come one, come all, and join our glee,&#xD;
We'll merry all the evening be,&#xD;
And sing, and laugh, and romp, and play,&#xD;
And books forget till break of day.&#xD;
The bell will ring, and up we'll spring,&#xD;
And with the lark at dawn we'll sing ;&#xD;
And then to books we'll speed straightway,&#xD;
And study well through all the day.&#xD;
Then merrily we'll sing to-night,&#xD;
Because our hearts are very light.&#xD;

&#xD;
Our Mother fond will join our song,&#xD;
For she has watched us all day long ;&#xD;
And now all care we'll cast aside,&#xD;
And spend a happy eventide.&#xD;
And when in prayer we bend us low,&#xD;
Up to heaven our plea shall go,&#xD;
That our dear Mother may be blest,&#xD;
With cheerful days and nights of rest.&#xD;
And when our schooling days are ended,&#xD;
All our odds and ills are mended,&#xD;
When the parting word is given,&#xD;
Still we'll pray to meet in Heaven.&#xD;
Every evening, after tea, the girls assembled in the&#xD;
long recitation-room, and sang, while Mrs. Densmore&#xD;
played, this cheerful little song, before they entered&#xD;
upon the evening's recreation and amusement. Mrs.&#xD;
Densmore was always touched to tears, when she heard&#xD;
that little song bursting out from the happy, innocent&#xD;
hearts of her pupils.  0, it was a happy scene!&#xD;
Each pupil, as she passed out into the promenade&#xD;
ground, received a kiss and a blessing from " Mother,"&#xD;
and then the merry laugh and shout told of joy and.&#xD;
happiness in all hearts.&#xD;
There you behold a pair of loving girls, arm in arm,&#xD;
or clasping each other around the waist, lightly trip-&#xD;
ping along the gravel-walk. Some are nursing the&#xD;
flowers, or admiring their branches, or making a bou-&#xD;
quet for " Mother ;" others are making a wreath of&#xD;
roses and jasmine, for they say their dear " Mother"&#xD;
shall be crowned a Queen that night ; others are fes-&#xD;
tooning the portico, and trimming the honeysuckle, that&#xD;
embowered it, with lights; some are arranging a plat-&#xD;
form, and a large armchair for the Throne. They are&#xD;

bent on a frolic. Others are in the great swing, bound-&#xD;
ing up and down, as light of heart as innocence itself;&#xD;
one is at the piano, trilling soft notes ; two little girls,&#xD;
in a room above, have stolen to the window, and are&#xD;
now looking sadly out upon the happy scene. Their&#xD;
little hearts are almost breaking. A slip of paper falls;&#xD;
a little girl, glad to do her companions a kindness, picks&#xD;
it up, and runs in to "Mother" with it.&#xD;
" If our dear, dear Mother will forgive us this time,&#xD;
we will not misbehave again. We know we have been&#xD;
naughty. But, dear Mother, please forgive us."&#xD;
That is enough. Mother cannot withstand that touch-&#xD;
ing pleas   And she runs up stairs, embraces the little&#xD;
penitents; for a moment, they mingle their tears to-&#xD;
gether, Mother and daughters : all is forgiven, and the&#xD;
little recreants run down stairs,. almost tumbling one&#xD;
over the other.&#xD;
The Throne is ready; the wreath is prepared; the&#xD;
lights are lit. While the Queen Mother is arrayed, and&#xD;
led out to the Throne, forty happy voices break out into&#xD;
this merry little song:&#xD;
Our Mother shall be Queen to-night,&#xD;
A very dear Mother is she,&#xD;
We'll crown her with flowers all as bright&#xD;
As ever bright can be.&#xD;
We'll wreathe her in roses woven well,&#xD;
And she shall look so fair,&#xD;
.A Faery Queen, we'll own her spell,&#xD;
With jewels we'll deck her hair.&#xD;
And then on a throne she shall sit,&#xD;
And we to her will sing.&#xD;
Setebower! it's brightly lit.&#xD;
And now our Mother we bring:&#xD;

On the evening in June, 18-, on which we sup-&#xD;
posed the reader to be passing this nursing-home, all&#xD;
the while these little songs were singing, and this inno-&#xD;
cent hilarity proceeding, a gentleman with a girl of&#xD;
about fifteen had remained, unobserved, in his car-&#xD;
riage, at the outer-gate, listening to the song of the&#xD;
light-hearted girls.&#xD;
A silent tear trickled down the cheek of the girl.&#xD;
Her heart throbbed with inexpressible emotions. Never&#xD;
before, had she heard such happy voices. Never be-&#xD;
fore, had such thrilling music fallen upon her heart,&#xD;
except when her dear departed mother sang some&#xD;
psalm or hymn, which told of redeeming love, and a&#xD;
brighter world on high, from the blessed old Prayer-&#xD;
Book, which she bore in her. hand, and which now,&#xD;
with her old Bible, she pressed to her heart, and kissed&#xD;
in rapturous joy, as the gifts which she received with&#xD;
her mother's dying blessing.&#xD;
"TMoTHER! DEAR MOTHER !" 0 how these words&#xD;
turned "her heart's blood" into tears ! 0 blessed Mo-&#xD;
ther's love, still linger about us on our way. Still cheer&#xD;
us to the tomb.&#xD;
" And will she be a MOTHER to me?  0, will she be&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGs BY THE WAYSIDE.            267&#xD;
a MOTHER to me ?" she involuntarily exclaimed, loud&#xD;
enough to be heard by the gentleman at her side, who&#xD;
had hitherto been absorbed in his own meditations, as&#xD;
he witnessed the beautiful and touching scene before&#xD;
him. "Yes, she will," said he, "my dear Agnes ;" for&#xD;
it was Mr. Lovegood. and Agnes Wallace. And tears&#xD;
welled up from his heart, and chased each other down&#xD;
his manly cheek. "Yes, she will. I know she will.&#xD;
This, my daughter,-for so now I shall ever call you,-&#xD;
is to be your future home, at least for four years. It&#xD;
will be a happy home for you. God bless you, my&#xD;
daughter. 0 could .your poor, dear mother, now in&#xD;
Paradise, have witnessed this scene, and heard those&#xD;
happy voices !"&#xD;
Here, for the present, we must leave Agnes.&#xD;
If hitherto she had known sorrow, and gxief had left&#xD;
its furrovs on her young brow, let us trust that there is&#xD;
a brighter future in store for her; that flowers, " bright&#xD;
flowers," may yet be strewn along the pathway of the&#xD;
poor orphan.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
GOSSIPING. PICTURES FROM LIFE. HOW TO GET MONEY&#xD;
FOR CHURCH PURPOSES, FROM THE BLEMMERTONS.&#xD;
TIME was, when scarcely a day rolled away, without&#xD;
bringing some startling event to pass, in the great city&#xD;
of     . But, strange to tell, nothing startling had oc&#xD;
curred, in the usual routine of events amongst St.  's&#xD;
congregation, since the time that the juvenile Captain&#xD;
Fastidious had marched the boys to the Sunday-School.&#xD;
If the reader will form one of our company, we will&#xD;
stroll into ene of those magnificent saloons, for which&#xD;
the city of -- was so justly celebrated.&#xD;
The dog-days have come; it is almost too hot for gos-&#xD;
siping ; yet, thanks to a plate of frozen cream and a&#xD;
glass of ice-water, we can endure a sprinkle of it. Per-&#xD;
haps, while enjoying our delectables from the frozen&#xD;
regions, it may suffice to remind us that summer is yet&#xD;
on hand.&#xD;
It is now the hour of dusk; the pleasantest period&#xD;
of a hot day in the city. While enjoying our cream&#xD;
a-la-mode, tete-a-tete, a couple of ladies enter, sweep&#xD;
gracefully up- the saloon, and take their seats at a table&#xD;
opposite to ours. It is unmannerly, we know, to listen;&#xD;
but if ladies will take seats near us, and will persist&#xD;
in speaking loud enough to be heard, we know not that&#xD;
we are bound to change our seats; and certainly we&#xD;
deem it no point of our duty to become deaf!&#xD;

There is a modern society called. "Know-Nothings;"&#xD;
a very apt title. These ladies belonged to a numerous&#xD;
society, whom, for want of a better title, we shall style&#xD;
"Like-Nothings." The Like-Nathings are a peculiar&#xD;
race, much given to fault-finding and intermeddling.&#xD;
Nothing is right, unless they do it themselves. And&#xD;
yet, alas ! they never bless the world by doing any&#xD;
thing.&#xD;
The secret of their success consists in undoing. But,&#xD;
we must permit them to speak for themselves.&#xD;
"Well, indeed, Mis. Nochurch," said Mrs. Fussy,&#xD;
"Mr. Lovegood seems to me to be a strange man.&#xD;
When lie was at my house the other day, lie scarcely&#xD;
had any thing to, say ; so, I thought I would try and&#xD;
draw him out, by praising his last sermon : there was,&#xD;
for a wonder, you know, nothing in it about 'the&#xD;
Church,' and the like. And what do you think he&#xD;
said? Would you believe that he would not hear a&#xD;
word of it, but just cut me short, by saying lie hoped I&#xD;
would profit by it !"&#xD;
"Did you ever ! It's so unlike Dr. Riproarer. I&#xD;
should not wonder if it is that that prevents him from&#xD;
getting the D. D. I do declare, I don't believe I can&#xD;
ever think much of a clergyman who is not a D. D.&#xD;
11 ia so-iuch pleasanter to say Doctor than Mr. so-and-&#xD;
so, forever. I think all who are not D. D.'s must be&#xD;
deficient in some respect. Now Dr. IRiproarer seems&#xD;
always under so many obligations, when one speaks&#xD;
well of his sermons, that it does one good to oblige him&#xD;
ii that way."&#xD;

is a [Roman] Catholic, and they all are bad enough,&#xD;
but I don't believe Jane will lie !"&#xD;
"0 dear, what ?" hurriedly and vehemently asked&#xD;
the lady, dropping her plate of frozen ice, as if it had&#xD;
been a hot iron.&#xD;
" Well, day before yesterday, Jane says, she saw Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood come round the corner, go down the alley&#xD;
behind the house, and enter that low, brawling grog-&#xD;
gery kept by Pat O'Ryman !" " 0 shame! You don't&#xD;
say so !" exclaimed Mrs. Nochurch, threatening to fall&#xD;
into a swoon, or spasm of horror and amazement.&#xD;
" True ! and Jane says she watched until he came out,&#xD;
and it was nearly an hour !" "Did you, in all .your&#xD;
life, ever hear the like! What is the world coming to ?&#xD;
A clergyman iira groggery! Only think of it! You&#xD;
may depend there was something wrong going on!"&#xD;
"I don't know; but Jane said, when he came out he&#xD;
looked queer! His head hung down, and he looked as&#xD;
though he feared some one would see him. He walked&#xD;
hurriedly out of the alley, and went on up the street!"&#xD;
"Now I do declare," said Mrs. Nochurch, "that re-&#xD;
minds me of what my John told ine. My John was&#xD;
coming home one night about midnight, a few evenings&#xD;
ago,-he had been at the theatre,-and whom should&#xD;
he meet right at that corner, but Mr. Lovegood! I told&#xD;
John not to speak of it; but it's too late now! How&#xD;
strange !"&#xD;
The ladies exchange a knowing look, and heave each&#xD;
a heavy sigh. But be not startled; be quiet, keep your&#xD;
seat!&#xD;
It was no trifling matter, that Mr. Lovegood had been&#xD;
seen to enter a groggery, and also at or near the same&#xD;

&#xD;
place, by another party, at the solemn hour of midnight.&#xD;
It never entered the generous mind of either of them,&#xD;
that he was doing any thing good. Charity might&#xD;
perhaps have whispered thus much. But Charity has&#xD;
nothing to do with a clergyman who enters a groggery;&#xD;
nor could she, in the minds of our two ladies, find any&#xD;
mantle to cover such a sin.&#xD;
Iiad " Jane" been properly employed in her culinary&#xD;
engagements, and Master John Nochurch sound asleep&#xD;
in his bed, instead of visiting that gateway to eternal&#xD;
death, the theatre, this wicked piece of gossip and bitter&#xD;
scandalizing had never come to light. But so the idle&#xD;
aid the wicked have eyes, ears, and hearts, for every&#xD;
thing but what is good and praiseworthy.&#xD;
After that knowing look had subsided into composure,&#xD;
Mrs. Nochurch continued the conversation. "0 dear,&#xD;
what will Dele Blemmerton think of that when she&#xD;
hears it !&#xD;
" Dele Blemmerton! La me, what has she to do&#xD;
with it ?" "'A great deal ! I reckon they are engaged&#xD;
to be married, or near it !" This last was spoken in an&#xD;
under-tone, and intended as a qualifying clause. " It&#xD;
can't be so!   It's impossible !" said Mrs. Fussy.&#xD;
" Don't everybody know that Dole Blemmerton is&#xD;
engaged to be married to Mr. Slopill !" " Well, I don't&#xD;
speak positively, mind you ! But Mrs. Blemmerton&#xD;
told me, the other day, that she thought things ' looked'&#xD;
that way ! And I'm sure she meant something!"&#xD;
"Mrs. Blemmerton! Well, I do declare! People&#xD;
are so strange now-a-days ! Why Mrs. Blemmerton has&#xD;
all along been opposed to Mr. Lovegood in the Church.&#xD;
They never liked him ; never wanted him here ! o,&#xD;

&#xD;
it's too bad, after hearing her say all that I have&#xD;
heard !"&#xD;
" I had rather not speak of it, but I know Mr. Love-&#xD;
good has been there a great deal of late, and Jenny&#xD;
McMeddlesome told me, that Dle told her, that she&#xD;
had given Mr. Lovegood a piece of poetry and a beau-&#xD;
tiful rose-bud ! And I know, that she bought, at Roun-&#xD;
delay's store, a few days ago, a splendid velvet sermon-&#xD;
holder, which she intended as a present to Mr. Love-&#xD;
good. And Pd like to know, if all this does not mean&#xD;
something? I know Mr. Lovegood says lie goes there&#xD;
to see Ben Slocum about confirmation, but that won't&#xD;
do to tell every body."&#xD;
"Do tell ! Really, between us, I'm losing all confi-&#xD;
dence in Mrs. Blemmerton. She is actually deceitful;&#xD;
I do declare she is !"&#xD;
" Well you know, as old aunt Sally says, 'It takes&#xD;
all sorts of people to make a world.' For my part, I'd&#xD;
rather not say all I know. But if it is a match, Mrs.&#xD;
Blenmmerton, you may depend, has made it up herself.&#xD;
Dear me, she is so crafty, so cunning, so managing!&#xD;
But hush ! I do believe she is coming! Yes, if here&#xD;
ain't Dle, too !"&#xD;
" Dear me, Mrs. Blemmerton, I'm so glad to see you!&#xD;
and you, too, Dele !" and the ladies kiss all around.&#xD;
"La! We were just talking about you, and good too !"&#xD;
"I thought so," exclaimed Mrs. Blemmerton, " my&#xD;
night earburnt so !" " And where, Mrs. llemmerton&#xD;
have you kept yourself? I haven't seen you for a&#xD;
week !"  "lBen Slocum's poor cousin Richard, you&#xD;
know, has been very ill for a week, and this kept us&#xD;
confined at home; and, poor fellow, after all that we&#xD;
&#xD;
could do he died yesterday, and we are just returning&#xD;
from his funeral! Poor fellow, he is gone !"&#xD;
Dear!" exclaimed both the ladies, "We never&#xD;
heard a word of it. Why did you not let us know?"&#xD;
"Well, you know, it's a very busy time ; our expenses&#xD;
just now are very heavy; and Mr. Blemmerton did not&#xD;
think it worth while to have much of a funeral. He&#xD;
said it would do poor Richard no good. But 0, such a&#xD;
sermon we heard, by the Reverend Simon Cobblecant-&#xD;
ing, who was a dear friend to Richard. 0, you ought&#xD;
to have heard it, and the eloquent -prayer, and the&#xD;
praises bestowed on Mr. Cobblecanting. It was&#xD;
preached in the New Jerusalem Church. It's many a&#xD;
day since I heard such a sermon F'&#xD;
That reminds us of spouting. " Mr. Cobblecantig&#xD;
was a decided spouterr !" This is a "spouting" age,&#xD;
and the world is full of "spouting."  Lord so-and-so&#xD;
made a great speech in Parliament the other day, on&#xD;
the question of the length of Punch's ears. Hon. Mr.&#xD;
Longsides contended, that Punch has no ears at all.&#xD;
Lord so-and-so contends, that he is a decided ass. It's&#xD;
a great question, and the papers ring out the labored&#xD;
speeches. The clash of arms is heard across the broad&#xD;
Atlantic ; and we are wonderfully edified.&#xD;
Mr. Such-a-one died in England, three hundred&#xD;
years ago. Mr. Such-a one was a very good man, no&#xD;
one doubts or questions it. Out comes a spoutingn"&#xD;
piece in the papers, calling upon all good Christians to&#xD;
contribute freely to the erection of a-great monuments&#xD;
or something else, to the memory of Mr. Such-a-one.&#xD;
Mr. Such-a-one lives in the memory of the Church or&#xD;

heaven is above earth. And if he could speak from&#xD;
the dead, he would say, "You had better rouse the&#xD;
people and teach them to devote their means to the&#xD;
spreading abroad of the Gospel of life and salvation !"&#xD;
Look at the heathen nillion;s in idolatry, crying aloud&#xD;
for the bread of life! Look at home upon the broad&#xD;
domain unclaimed by the Church; hear the voice that&#xD;
cries, day by day, to heaven, "Thy Kingdom come!"&#xD;
0 send us the Church, with her healing waters, her&#xD;
words of love and bread of life !"  Hear the wail of the&#xD;
suffering Missionary, alone in the wilderness, as he&#xD;
stretches out his hands for help, and groans aloud in&#xD;
his agony of soul.&#xD;
But 0, they are not dead! While there's life, there's&#xD;
hope! If they die we'll "spout;" they are glorious&#xD;
Christians; they died in harness: we'll build them&#xD;
monuments; we'll sing requiems o'er their grave.&#xD;
It's all " spouting ;" spout, spout, spout ; speech,&#xD;
speech, speech ! It amounts to nothing ! It is "empty,&#xD;
destitute, and void," as Hooker would say, of any real&#xD;
good to the world or the Church. We are full of&#xD;
speechifying congratulations, sounding of big guns.&#xD;
Weightier issues are cast into the shade.&#xD;
Is it not time to take up practicals ? Is it not time&#xD;
to begin to "spout" to some purpose ?&#xD;
Let us draw one or' two little pictures.&#xD;
Picture 1st. "If we waited for the Episcopal Church&#xD;
to bring them (i. e., the blessings of the Church) to us,&#xD;
several generations might grow up and die in heathen-&#xD;
ish ignorance."*&#xD;

DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             275&#xD;
We take this paragraph from one of our Church pa-&#xD;
pers. It was the remark made by a Churchman, with&#xD;
regard to the tardiness of the Church in claiming the&#xD;
wide field opened unto her in the great Southwest. It&#xD;
is a sore rebukO. Where does it fall? Upon the chil-&#xD;
dren of the Church ! And for them we' write. They&#xD;
do not supply the means, to enable the Church to claim&#xD;
her own, and do her Lord's work.&#xD;
Picture 2d. The Church papers make an appeal, on&#xD;
behalf of a College in Canada, and a Missionary work&#xD;
there. The appeal is handsomely responded to; and&#xD;
the next thing we hear is, that twelve thousand dollars,&#xD;
or more, are liberally contributed to those objects.&#xD;
This is all highly gratifying. As a daughter, the Church&#xD;
in the United States owes much to her good old mother,&#xD;
the Church of England; and it really does the heart&#xD;
good, to see the daughter and her children so generously&#xD;
disposed to recognize the filial duty of honoring her&#xD;
parent, and returning into her bosom and that of her&#xD;
children, (for we all are one family in Christ, and we&#xD;
rejoice in it,) even a small portion of the fostering love&#xD;
that for so many years she derived from her.&#xD;
" Honor thy father and thy mother," is the first com-&#xD;
mandment with promise. And it is just as true, with-&#xD;
out doubt, of our spiritual mother as of our natural, for&#xD;
there is no tie closer than that which exists between&#xD;
the family of Christ, the communion of saints ! And&#xD;
it is cheering, to see the generous-hearted children of&#xD;
the Church, thus fulfilling the sacred duty of cementing&#xD;
the bonds of union between mother and daughter, and&#xD;
spreading abroad the Messiah's Kingdom.&#xD;
But she who is a daughter has also grown to be a&#xD;

mother; and, with the spirit and genius of our common&#xD;
country, her children have gone out, seeking their own&#xD;
fortunes, have spread themselves abroad over this wide&#xD;
domain, and, here and there, from every wilderness,&#xD;
every hamlet, town, and village, there is a cry coming&#xD;
up, " Sirs, we be brethren ! Help us as the Lord hath&#xD;
prospered you!   Send us Missionaries ; assist us in&#xD;
sustaining them ! Help us to build sanctuaries ; help&#xD;
us to found colleges; help us to make this fair wilder-&#xD;
ness blossom as the rose !" Our children are growing&#xD;
up, without the baptismal covenant; our "young men&#xD;
and maidens" are joining the ranks of heresy or schism&#xD;
our old men and women, our fathers and mothers, are&#xD;
sinking into the grave, without the cheering voice of the&#xD;
Priest of the Church, without the comforting message&#xD;
of love, without the symbols of the broken body and&#xD;
shed blood of the Son of God! Ye who are wealthy,&#xD;
ye whom the Lord hath put in possession of the abun-&#xD;
dance of the isles and the seas, and so hath made&#xD;
stewards in his vineyard, hear our call ! We ask you&#xD;
not to bestow on any less; but do not quite forget us !&#xD;
Turn us not away enpty, when we call upon you !&#xD;
Picture 3d. Mrs. Fastidious is very busy, arranging&#xD;
a great clerical dinner to be given to Dr. Riproarer.&#xD;

curtains, which cost several hundred dollars each, and&#xD;
which flash their brilliancy from their gold and silver&#xD;
figures, are down; and the paint-brush is busy on the&#xD;
sash and frames; the velvet carpets are all removed ;&#xD;
the brass is rubbed ; the chandeliers are decorated:&#xD;
every thing, from the attic to the cellar, is in commo-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion. Mrs. Fastidious in her chamber, is being meas-&#xD;
ured and fitted with a magnificent velvet dress, while&#xD;
on her head rests a gorgeous head-dress, in which she&#xD;
is to appear at diner, and which sparkles with costly&#xD;
jewels, which, so soon as the chandeliers are lit, will&#xD;
throw her light far and near around her. She is deter-&#xD;
mined to shine by her own light, and not her husband's,&#xD;
as the old law used to read. " It is very becoming,&#xD;
Ma'am ! A beautiful thing, indeed I" And Mrs. Fas-&#xD;
tidious smiles very graciously. A ring at the bell !&#xD;
" Dear me, who would interrupt me now ? I do wish&#xD;
people would&#xD;
" Mrs. Rector, from the country, wants to see you,&#xD;
Ma'am !"  "Ah, yes ! Tell her I'm busy; beg to be&#xD;
excused ! I'm fixing for company; a dinner to Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer; can't possibly see her now !"&#xD;
Mrs. Rector departs, not, however, without sad re-&#xD;
flections. She has come to town to call, instead of her&#xD;
husband, on a few wealthy Church ladies, soliciting a&#xD;
few dollars for the building of his little chapel.&#xD;
She is an indefatigable woman, not easily discouraged;&#xD;
therefore she determines to seek Mr. Fastidious at his&#xD;
office. lie is very wealthy, and will certainly give her&#xD;
something very handsome!&#xD;
" No, Madam, I'm not able. I have to give so much&#xD;
at home. Remember, I had to pay a tax of two hun-&#xD;
dred and fifty dollars, six months ago, towards liquida-&#xD;
ting our Ohurch debt.&#xD;
Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Fastidious think themselves&#xD;
good Christians. Their money is their own. Dr. Rip-&#xD;
roarer's dinner-party cost upwards of two thousand&#xD;
dollars. What of that ?  it made Mr. and Mrs. F.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
A NEW IDEA. A CASE OF CASUISTRY. MR. STRAGGLER, THE&#xD;
MISSIONARY FROM THE WEST. SOME DISCLOSURES.&#xD;
WE should, ere this, have announced the fact, that&#xD;
Mrs.. Fussy delivered the truth, when she with indigna-&#xD;
tion informed Mrs. Nochurch, that Miss Deliah Airmyth&#xD;
Blemmeton was engaged to be married to one Mr.&#xD;
Slopill. This betrothment had existed for the year&#xD;
past. Mr. Slopill was said to be a man of some tal-&#xD;
eut in his line; kept a pretty large bacon and feed&#xD;
store; dealt in eatables in general; and was celebrated&#xD;
for good wines and cigars, and patent quack medicines.&#xD;
But he lacked energy, and was what would be called a&#xD;
"slow coach;" it took time and perseverance to move&#xD;
him.&#xD;
When called behind his counter, by the hasty rap-&#xD;
ping of a penny in the hand of an urchin, for a cent's&#xD;
worth of snuff, or a plug of tobacco, though it were a&#xD;
case of life or death depending on the promptitude of&#xD;
his movements, he would always take time, in the "of-&#xD;
fice," as, par excellence, he termed a little private room&#xD;
in his store, to comb his whiskers, which were quite lux-&#xD;
uriant, brush his hair and teeth, and otherwise make his&#xD;
toilette. Ie was never known to be in a hurry but&#xD;
once, and that was when he was running away from an&#xD;
anxious creditor.&#xD;
It was amusing to watch the little begrimed urchins,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7334-00000141"/>&#xD;
280        THE BLEMMEETONS; OR,&#xD;
holding aloft the mighty penny, and ever and anon slap.&#xD;
ping it down with considerable irritability on the coun-&#xD;
ter,-whack, whack, whack ! as if the wheels of the&#xD;
world stood still, while they were unserved, and they&#xD;
were anxious to start them. Whack, whack, whack !&#xD;
Oh me, manny is in a hurry; I'll git whipped! I do&#xD;
wish-"    "Be there in a moment!" cries a voice&#xD;
from before the looking-glass in the office. "Soon as&#xD;
lie's done his whiskers !" says another urchin. Out&#xD;
walks the veritable gentleman, all done up, elegantly&#xD;
combed, brushed, sleeked, and powdered.&#xD;
"And what'll you hey ?" " And please, Sir, a pen-&#xD;
ny's worth o' snuff. And mammy's in a hurry; and I'll&#xD;
get whipped !" "' Spose your mammy won't die for it&#xD;
in so short a time ! You made noise -enough to hey&#xD;
ben a purchaser to the amount of a thousand dollars !"&#xD;
says whiskers, rather testily. "And you," says Young&#xD;
America, retiring with the snuff, "took as long to comb&#xD;
your head, as my daddy would take to barbarize a&#xD;
dozen monkeys." And away ran Young America,&#xD;
singing Yankee-Doodle.&#xD;
Poor Mr. Slopill had to bear it. "A fig on all chil-&#xD;
dren!" said he, gritting his teeth, "children and babies&#xD;
are humbugs; I really wish they'd keep away from&#xD;
here. Babies do nothing but whine, and screech,,and&#xD;
cry, the puling things ; and as soon as they are old&#xD;
enough to talk, they are chock full of all evil and abom-&#xD;
inable wickedness. That fellow's head hasn't been&#xD;
combed since the hair grew upon it. A humbug they&#xD;
are, every one of them. I don't know what they are&#xD;
made for, except to give trouble." And so Mr. Slopilli&#xD;
would continue to scold at the whole race of juveniles,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.  281&#xD;
&#xD;
until he soothed his irritated feelings, and avenged his&#xD;
insulted dignity. If he was not a rnisogamist, he was,&#xD;
while in one of these pets, a confirmed child-kater.&#xD;
But, withal, Mr. Slopill was rather an agreeable and&#xD;
gentlemanly man; a good deal given to dandyism, but&#xD;
quite free from another filing, an over-stock of goo&#xD;
common sense. Yet, somehow, calculating mamas and&#xD;
papas did not altogether fancy him as.a brilliant match&#xD;
for their daughters: they thought him too inert; a mere&#xD;
seeker of a wealthy matrimonial alliance. While, there-&#xD;
fore, he was quite a favorite, with some of the young&#xD;
ladies who admired a handsome pair of whiskers, a&#xD;
sleek head, tiim-fitting kids, boots, and a handsome&#xD;
cane, he was far from being popular with the older&#xD;
heads.&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton did not fancy him at all; because,&#xD;
when lie was a lad serving his apprenticeship at the&#xD;
grocery business, he refused to carry a middling of&#xD;
bacon home in his hand to a customer. A man or boy&#xD;
who was above his business, was not the one for Mr.&#xD;
Blemmerton. And we give Mr. B. due credit for such&#xD;
a decision. He was right, for once in his life, all de-&#xD;
murrers to the contrary, notwithstanding. Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Blemmerton were therefore opposed to Mr. Slopill's ad-&#xD;
dresses; he was not the man for tiem. Mr. B. had no&#xD;
money to spend in trimming and training whiskers,&#xD;
buying scented soaps, ivory combs, gold-headed canes,&#xD;
and the like. And when matters came to a crisis, Mr.&#xD;
Slopill was forbidden the house; and, so far as the pa-&#xD;
rents were concerned, the. whole affair was dissolved&#xD;
into thin air.&#xD;
Not so with Miss Deliah Airmyth and Mr. Slopill.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7334-00000142"/>&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Deliah having not been trained in the strict&#xD;
school of parental obedience, possessed too of a touch&#xD;
of the romantic in her composition, determined to coun.-&#xD;
teract the determination and advice of her parents, and&#xD;
continue the betrothment, trusting to time and chance&#xD;
for future developments-: hence, a clandestine corre-&#xD;
spondence was kept up between the parties; and they&#xD;
met occasionally, by accident, as they would have it&#xD;
supposed, at the house of some mutual friend or ac-&#xD;
quaintance.&#xD;
And here for the present we must leave them, with&#xD;
the remark, that in thus acting upon the principles of&#xD;
duplicity, Miss Deliah was only developing the elements&#xD;
of the false education she had received.&#xD;
It happened on a certain day, memorable in the his-&#xD;
tory of that portion of the citizens of the city of&#xD;
who composed the congregation of St.   's church,&#xD;
that Mr. Lovegood was invited to dine with Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Nochurch; and that, but a few days before the noted&#xD;
discovery, made by Mr. John Nochurch and Mrs. Fus-&#xD;
sy's servant girl Jane, of Mr. Lovegood's entry into the&#xD;
groggery of Pat O'Ryman. There was quite an assem-&#xD;
blage; and, among the number, the Blemmerton family,&#xD;
all except Mr. Ben Slocum Sapientium. As usual on&#xD;
such occasions, the conversation was chiefly of a gen-&#xD;
eral character. Mru-Lovegood threw in a word occa-&#xD;
sionally, that savored of soundness of speech and whole-&#xD;
some doctrine, or otherwise cheered the day by enli-&#xD;
vening and instructive conversation. Mr. Elemmerton&#xD;
and Mr. Nochurch discoursed of stocks, trade, the&#xD;
tightness of the money-market, the latest news in the&#xD;
commercial world, and Mr. Heartful's late speech in&#xD;
&#xD;
Congress, which Mr. Blemmerton thought a decided&#xD;
failure, and threatened to discontinue one of his papers,&#xD;
on account of its laudations of the speech aforesaid.&#xD;
The elderly ladies discussed Mrs. Friendly's new car-&#xD;
riage: one thought it a very clumsy affair; another&#xD;
thought that it would do for her. They also laid plans&#xD;
for the latest styles of furniture, and the new furnishing&#xD;
of their several establishments. Mr. Blemmerton in-&#xD;
quired very particularly respecting Agnes Wallace, Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood's charming little protegee. The young ladies&#xD;
discussed the last ball, the forth-coming lectures, operas,&#xD;
etc.; and their several prospects in the matrimonial&#xD;
market.&#xD;
Mrs. Presbyterian started the only question in casu-&#xD;
istry. Speaking in strong terms of condemnation of&#xD;
Mrs. Friendly and Mrs. Hopeful, she said she thought&#xD;
they had better conceal their faults; they were so very&#xD;
faulty in many respects, that it was really shameful.&#xD;
Miss Julia Jasper for the first time heard these ladies&#xD;
condemned. She believed, that, if they had faults, they&#xD;
were of a very trifling character; for her part, she&#xD;
thought them faultless; still, if they had faults, she was&#xD;
clearly of the-opinion that they should not endeavor to&#xD;
cloak them, and pretend to be what they were not; that&#xD;
she thought would be hypocritical. On this question&#xD;
the ladies kept up a spirited conversation; one espous-&#xD;
ing one side, another the other; one thought it dutiful to&#xD;
conceal one's faults, another contended for the contrary.&#xD;
It involved a casuistical inquiry which baffled the la-&#xD;
dies ; at last they appealed to Mr. Lovegood, and&#xD;

"Ladies," said he, "I will endeavor to solve your&#xD;
question in the fewest possible words. It is best, if we&#xD;
can possibly have it so, not to have faults either to con-&#xD;
ceal or expose." Answer the question better, if you&#xD;
can. It satisfied the ladies, at least it brought the dis-&#xD;
cussion to a close. And -it must not be disguised, that&#xD;
several of them about that time looked half-innocent,&#xD;
half-guilty, as though they suspected him of having&#xD;
some hidden meaning in his solution. Whether he had&#xD;
or not, is not material. The proposition is a good one;&#xD;
but not so easily carried out to the very letter.&#xD;
The day passed quietly away, with but a single iiter-&#xD;
ruption ; the call of a Missionary from the great West,&#xD;
soliciting means to aid in building a church. Mrs. No-&#xD;
church invited him into a private parlor, informed him&#xD;
that she had company, which was, of course, a gentle&#xD;
hint that he should make his stay as short as possible,&#xD;
profiting by which (on the principle, verbum sap.) the&#xD;
good Missionary, like a prompt business man, without a&#xD;
long preface, came to the point at once. ie was min-&#xD;
istering in a new country, in a very promising field -&#xD;
but, as in almost all the new countries, the people did&#xD;
not fully appreciate the Church. Besides, they were&#xD;
but recently settled, just getting under way, and their&#xD;
means were limited; yet, as far as they were able, they&#xD;
were willing to help themselves along, and had done so&#xD;
with a liberal hand. Still, after almost superhuman&#xD;
:efforts at home, they lacked a thousand dollars, to&#xD;
complete their cherished sanctuary; and his vestry had&#xD;
requested him to call on a number of the wealthy and&#xD;
influential Churchmen in that city, to solicit their kind&#xD;
offices. He felt assured, that few more worthy objects&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
. could be presented to her kindly and charitable consid-&#xD;
eration. His church was in the chief city in that new&#xD;
and flourishing country ; and its influence was destined&#xD;
to be felt, not only at home, but all over that vast re-&#xD;
gion ; and, therefore, he could not doubt, that, wherev-&#xD;
er he went, he should meet with a generous response.&#xD;
Mrs. Nochurch took the Missionary's subscription-&#xD;
book ; and rapidly conning it, reading every name and&#xD;
the amount subscribed by each, returned it to hiu  with&#xD;
the remark: "Pm  sorry, Sir, that we can do nothing&#xD;
for you. We are poor, Mr. Straggler, and have little to&#xD;
give, beyond our charities at home. Indeed, we have&#xD;
to pay so much for pew-rent here, that we are able to&#xD;
do very little more. Fifty dollars pew-rent, Sir, per&#xD;
annum, is a great deal for one family to pay for a pew.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood's salary is put at so high a mark, that it&#xD;
strains us all very much ;.and, indeed, it is whispered&#xD;
that, in these hard times, it must be increased ; if so, I&#xD;
know not what we are to do.&#xD;
" Know it is said, Sir, that we are rich ; but, indeed&#xD;
it is-a grave mistake. We have, it is true, just received&#xD;
a legacy of one hundred thousand dollars, and had,&#xD;
prior to that about sixty thousand dollars worth of&#xD;
property; but this is very far from. being a fortune.&#xD;
Many of our friends say, that they will, account us poor&#xD;
till we are worth a million.&#xD;
" And yet, notwithstanding our poverty, we are very&#xD;
charitable. I pay my milliner two hundred dollars per&#xD;
annum ; my mantua-maker I pay four hundred ; my&#xD;
washer-woman, two hundred ; and then the upholster-&#xD;
er, shoemaker, hair-dresser, confectioner, these all come&#xD;
in for a large portion of our charities. On the score of&#xD;

286&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
charity, then, after paying fifty dollars pew-rent, we&#xD;
feel entirely clear, and certainly are clear."&#xD;
The good Missionary thought that these expenditures&#xD;
could not be classed fairly amongst charitable dispensa-&#xD;
tions : they were rather involved in the necessary ex-&#xD;
penses of a large family and of numerous entertain-&#xD;
ments. They were expenditures for services rendered,&#xD;
value received, and therefore, not to be classed among&#xD;
charitable distributions.&#xD;
Mrs. Nochurch begged leave to differ from him in&#xD;
opinion, very essentially. They were charities; for they&#xD;
could, if they would, curtail nearly t1iree-fourths of&#xD;
them ; therefore he must grant that three-fourths of&#xD;
them, or near it, were charities. For her part, she did&#xD;
not know what such dependants would do, should all&#xD;
the people in the " best society" curtail their expenses.&#xD;
They would 'certainly starve ; and, therefore, she&#xD;
thought it would be sinful in them to do so. And it&#xD;
was as much on that account as any other, that she dis-&#xD;
bursed her means so bountifully among them.&#xD;
The poor Missionary had never met a case like this&#xD;
before. It was a novelty of a rare order. " Ah, Mad-&#xD;
am," said he, smiling at the happy thought, "my great&#xD;
country opens her rich bosom to all such 'dependants'&#xD;
as those of whom you speak. if they should be de-&#xD;
prived of the means of subsistence, by the cutting-off&#xD;
of their bread here, in the loss of 'the charities' of&#xD;
which you speak, it would be to them a real blessing,&#xD;
if it turned their feet to that mighty region toward&#xD;
the going down of the sun, which is ready to open its&#xD;
treasures of abundance and pour them into their laps.&#xD;
And then, too, perchance, Madam, a portion of that&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
287&#xD;
&#xD;
three-fourths of the whole expenditures of the weJthy,&#xD;
that now flow out in such ' charities' as pamper lust,&#xD;
and pride, and fashion, might flow in the channels of&#xD;
the Church, and become real blessings to the world. I&#xD;
have, I must tell you frankly, Madam, but little faith&#xD;
in ' charities' of the class named by you. They spring&#xD;
not, I dare avouch, from any love of the poor artisan,&#xD;
but from a love of the world, and the pleasures of a&#xD;
pampered heart, doating on its own fond hankerings af-&#xD;
ter display in the world."&#xD;
Here the good Missionary, seeing his prospects slen-&#xD;
der, with a sad heart takes his hat, and is about to&#xD;
make a graceful exit, when the lady requests him to be&#xD;
seated a moment, saying that a very wealthy lady, a&#xD;
millionaire, is in the house, who is known to be very&#xD;
liberal, whom she will ask to see him.&#xD;
In a few moments Mrs. Blemmerton is introduced to&#xD;
the Missionary. She receives his story very graciously;&#xD;
informs him that she has nothing with her, but gives&#xD;
him the street and number of her residence, and&#xD;
requests him to call in the evening, when Mr. Blem-&#xD;
umerton would be at home, and they would likely respond&#xD;
favorably to his call.&#xD;
iProspects were brightening. -Hope is full of comfort.&#xD;
Hope is a golden pillar, set around with jewels, bright&#xD;
and sparkling, and flashing in their own light. lope&#xD;
contends with despair, chases away despondency,&#xD;
buckles on the armor of perseverance, surmounts diffi-&#xD;
culties, lives in bright prospects and on bright smiles,&#xD;
sees through the clouds, looks in to the sunshine. With&#xD;
many thanks, and a cheerful smile, the Missionary took&#xD;
his departure.&#xD;

The ladies returned to the drawing-room, and were&#xD;
joined by the gentlemen in a few moments ; all of&#xD;
them, at least, except Mr. Lovegood, who, wrapped in&#xD;
his own meditations, sat in the back portico, thinking&#xD;
about Heartfulville, his pleasant study, the wrens and&#xD;
the mockings, the elms-and the roses.&#xD;
" La! Mrs. Blemmerton," said Mrs. Nochurch, " did&#xD;
you read that list of subscribers ?" "No, I did not."&#xD;
Well, it was a curiosity. Would you believe, that&#xD;
Mr. Friendly's name is down for two hundred dollars?"&#xD;
"I want to know! That man is certainly destined for&#xD;
the almshouse. He's scarcely worth fifty thousand&#xD;
dollars ; doing a small business : only making ten&#xD;
thousand dollars a year. Yesterday, a new carriage&#xD;
and a pair of horses that did not cost less than eight&#xD;
hundred dollars, though it's a plain, common thing;&#xD;
and to-day, two hundred dollars to go away off to that&#xD;
outlandish country."&#xD;
" And then," continued Mrs. Nochurch, " Mrs.&#xD;
Church's name is down for a hundred dollars ; and you,&#xD;
know she is very poor. Mr. Happy, Mrs. Charitas,&#xD;
Mrs. Hopeful, and Mr. Goodall are each down for&#xD;
seventy-five dollars. Now, if Mr. Lovegood's salary is&#xD;
to be increased, as they say it is, how much more&#xD;
becoming would it have been in them, to give it to the&#xD;
vestry for that purpose. But I suppose their money is&#xD;
their own : still, it's certainly very foolish for people to&#xD;
be so lavish of their means. They may come to&#xD;
want themselves ; and then, if I'm not mistaken, they'll&#xD;
learn a lesson."&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton thought, truly, it did not concern&#xD;
them. "A fool and his pence," said he, "soon part&#xD;
&#xD;
company. As to Mr. Friendly, he had long since&#xD;
known that he did not know the worth of money. But,&#xD;
he was a peculiar man ; denied himself almost the&#xD;
common necessaries of life, that he might give his&#xD;
money away to every snivelling beggar that came&#xD;
along ; built fine houses to rent to mechanics, that&#xD;
made them above themselves, and scarcely paid him&#xD;
five per cent. on the investment. But it was no concern&#xD;
of theirs ; they need not trouble themselves about it."&#xD;
" He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord."&#xD;
This was an investment that never crossed the specula-&#xD;
tive path of Mr. John Blemnmerton.   His lifetime&#xD;
charities were confined to the brief period when he was&#xD;
silly enough to allow his own pride to run him as a&#xD;
candidate for Congress. He was now fully satisfied,&#xD;
that mankind were ungrateful. This was his hobby&#xD;
he had no faith in humanity ; a man's charities were&#xD;
not appreciated. He had no more favors to ask, none&#xD;
to grant. He was safe for this world, as he thought ;&#xD;
as to the next, he would leave it to take care of itself.&#xD;
Alas! that mankind should so trifle with their immortal&#xD;
destinies.&#xD;
We have somewhere read a thrilling incident of a&#xD;
party of pleasure, in a boat on the -coast of Norway,&#xD;
who ventured out to the outer circle of the eddy of the&#xD;
Maelstrom. It was a daring and perilous enterprise ;&#xD;
and perhaps its very peril was the incentive to the trial.&#xD;
Having made every preparation, away they dash, a&#xD;
merry company of young men and maidens, through&#xD;
the foaming sea. They approach the outer circle of the&#xD;
Maelstrom: there all is calm and serene. They glide&#xD;
into the enchanted circle, withdraw their oars, and give&#xD;

themselves up to its revolving tide. Round they go;&#xD;
slowly, leisurely, delightfully. All are joyous ;-all&#xD;
happy. The merry laugh rings over the deep, blue&#xD;
wave. They will enjoy the exciting scene awhile, ply&#xD;
their oars, and escape from their impending doom.&#xD;
But time passes on ; round they go, circle after circle,&#xD;
each faster than the other, each approaching nearer to&#xD;
the awful vortex.&#xD;
The waters now begin to be slightly agitated ; they&#xD;
grow a little uneasy, but it is time enough yet to&#xD;
escape. A  few more intoxicating rounds, and then&#xD;
they will ply their oars. Suddenly there is an awful.&#xD;
p     ; the merry laugh has ceased ; pale fear sits on&#xD;
every countenance ; the cold sweat-drops gather on the&#xD;
brow. The waters begin to foam and lash ; and lo !&#xD;
there is the portentous roar of the dreaded vortex !&#xD;
They are approaching that gulf from which there is&#xD;
no return. And now the oars fly out, and stalwart&#xD;
arms strike for life. But, alas ! too late. That mighty&#xD;
tide is stronger than they. That weak boat trembles, in&#xD;
every timber and every joint. Each heart is petrified.&#xD;
Each eye is set in the glare of death. The revolving&#xD;
tide rages, and foams, and roars, and lashes itself in&#xD;
its fury, sending tip its hoarse laugh in mockery of the&#xD;
wail of its victims. They must measure the depths of&#xD;
that awful Maelstrom, and be cast away in the wide&#xD;
ocean of eternity.&#xD;
And how many, alas ! of the children of this world&#xD;
are revolving on that tide of destruction! How many&#xD;
of the characters whom we have introduced to the&#xD;
reader, are rapidly approaching the dreaded vortex!&#xD;
Remonstrance is in vain. They will not hear the&#xD;

warning voice. A little more pleasure of this world,&#xD;
a little more saving to the flesh; they will close their&#xD;
ears against the ominous sounds that fall upon them.&#xD;
Round they go; it is time enough yet; it is so delight-&#xD;
ful; I will bask awhile in the billows,-play in the&#xD;
foam,-but, alas ! all on a sudden, they are gone ! One&#xD;
long, low wail, and all is over!&#xD;
" O, set me up on the Rock that is higher than 1."&#xD;
Ps. lxi. 3. Ah, place yourself in the position of that&#xD;
wild party of pleasure; and then fancy, that before you&#xD;
rises a bold rock in its majesty, against which that re-&#xD;
volving tide lashes its waves and spends its fury in&#xD;
vain. It is a haven of security, if you can only reach&#xD;
it. Upon its proud, defiant pinnacle, if once you can&#xD;
but plant your feet, you may rest, and laugh at the&#xD;
mighty waves that roll beneath you.&#xD;
Oh, how those trembling, defenceless maidens in&#xD;
that maddened whirlpool would have cried out to the&#xD;
stronger arms, "0, set me up upon the Rock, that is&#xD;
higher than I!"&#xD;
And this is what we all have, in the great Maelstrom&#xD;
of the world. There is a mighty Rock set there in the&#xD;
midst of its troubled waves, defying all their furious&#xD;
lashings and roaring; and, throughout the wide world,&#xD;
there is a voice crying day by day, and day by day&#xD;
does the prayer of the Church Militant ascend to&#xD;
heaven, "0, set me up upon the Rock that is higher&#xD;
than I."*&#xD;
This is the Rock of our Salvation, even Jesus Christ.&#xD;

MR. NOCIIURCHIS DONATION TO MR. STRAGGLER.   MR.&#xD;
FRIENDLY s SHOSPITALITIES. GOD'S PROVIDENCE ILLUS-&#xD;
TRATED.  MR. STRAGGLER'S PRACTICAL CONVERSATION&#xD;
WITH MR. BLEMMERTON.&#xD;
MR. NoonuRcn listened, with evident concern, to the&#xD;
last-named conversation between his wife and his guests,&#xD;
but observed a profound silence. He was revolving in&#xD;
his mind a plan, which, had he dared to speak of it,&#xD;
he would have named to his wife ; moreover, he would&#xD;
have expressed his deep regret, that she did not inform&#xD;
him when Mr. Straggler was present. It struck him&#xD;
very forcibly, that persons who could afford to give so&#xD;
many handsome dinners and other entertainments as&#xD;
they did, could, or ought to, afford to assist so worthy&#xD;
a cause as that presented by the Missionary. Thotmgh&#xD;
not a thoroughly instructed Churchman, nor a commu-&#xD;
nicant, Mr. Nochurch was a man of good intentions,&#xD;
and, when rightly approached, of warm and kindly&#xD;
sympathies; and with a proper help-mate, he would,&#xD;
long ere this, have been a consistent Christian, a really&#xD;
pious and useful man.&#xD;
His wife managed, for the most part, affairs at home;&#xD;
and, unless an application of the kind presented itself at&#xD;
his place of business, he rarely heard any thing of it.&#xD;
He was pained, and deeply mortified, that such a Mis-&#xD;
sionary as Mr. Straggler, of whose good report he had&#xD;

often heard, should be sent away from his door empty;&#xD;
and that, too, on an occasion when they were liberally&#xD;
spending a very handsome sum in playing the agreeable&#xD;
with their friends and neighbors.&#xD;
His conscience was ill at ease; yet he knew       how&#xD;
hopeless a task it would be to say aught to his wife.*&#xD;
He treasured in his heart a portion of Mr. Lovegood's&#xD;
sermon, the Sunday before, on the character of Lot;&#xD;
that portion, especially, in which he dwelt on the duty&#xD;
of entertaining strangers, and ministering to their ne-&#xD;
cessities, in which he said, that in so doing, " we often&#xD;
entertain angels unawares," who are sent out by our&#xD;
heavenly Father to minister blessings unto us. Mr. No-&#xD;
church meditated long and earnestly o1 these thoughts;&#xD;
and the more he meditated, the more distinctly (lid the&#xD;
path of duty appear marked out before him.          Who&#xD;
knows, mused he to himself, but that the Missionary&#xD;
was an angel of mercy and love, commissioned to bless&#xD;
my house.    Woe is me, if he hath shaken off the dust&#xD;
of his feet as a testimony against us&#xD;
The afternoon had worn pretty well away; the length-&#xD;
ened shadows of the neighboring houses gave token of&#xD;
the approach of night, when Mr. Blemmerton begged&#xD;
* The writer is giving sketches of character. Such a character as&#xD;
that of Mrs. Nochurch, he rejoices, is rare.eHe also rejoices in the&#xD;
acknowledgment, that to woman belongs every noble and generous&#xD;
impulse; and he thinks that in this work he has given to her the meed&#xD;
of just and honorable praise. On that score he has nothing to fear.&#xD;
But the rule is not without exceptions ; and it must be acknowledged,&#xD;
that, now and then, such as Mrs. Nochurch are found, as well as,&#xD;
among men, such as Mr. Blemmerton. We promised to blend the two&#xD;
sides of life in one picture, but disclaim any thing more. We aim at&#xD;
no cIasses or creeds in particular.&#xD;

to be excused, to go to his business. Mr. .Nochurch,&#xD;
who for some time had been a little restive, accompa-&#xD;
nied him to the street; and, after a walk of a few&#xD;
sc1uares, they parted, Mr. Elemmerton for his counting.&#xD;
room, Mr. Nochurch on an errand that will do him&#xD;
credit.&#xD;
In the eyes of the " upper-tens," Mr. Friendly was&#xD;
not a wealthy man; but he always. had enough, and&#xD;
something to spare for any worthy cause that presented&#xD;
itself. If not rich in money, he was rich in faith. His&#xD;
charities for the year past had been very large; for it&#xD;
had been a year of extraordinary trials to the poor, and&#xD;
indeed to all classes. He had almost entirely support-&#xD;
ed Mrs. Wallace, till the day of her death ; the cholera&#xD;
had raged with terrible destruction, desolating the&#xD;
hearths and homes of thousands, sweeping off numbers&#xD;
of his tenants, leaving helpless widows and sorrowing&#xD;
orphans, to all of whom he had relinquished their rents,&#xD;
and besides had contributed unsparingly to their neces-&#xD;
sities. No mouth went unfed, no body unclothed, of&#xD;
all who came under the broad mantle of his charities.&#xD;
These extraordinary outgoings had indeed absorbed&#xD;
every dollar of ready money that could be spared from&#xD;
his business. And in addition to all this, his own dear&#xD;
wife had been brought to the brink of the grave, by an&#xD;

cian, lie had been induced to purchase a carriage and a&#xD;
pai ofhoresthat every suitable afternoon she might&#xD;
enjoy a ride in the pure country air. This had added&#xD;
largely to his expenditures. It had also been agreed,&#xD;

that Mrs. Friendly should take a trip to the White&#xD;
Sulphur Springs in Virginia. Every arrangement had&#xD;
been made ; and she was bringing her preparations for&#xD;
the departure to a close.&#xD;
The day before that on which he called on Mrs. No-&#xD;
church, the Missionary, the Rev. Mr. Straggler, had&#xD;
called and presented his claim to Mr. Friendly at his&#xD;
office. Mr. Friendly invited him to call at his residence,&#xD;
at two o'clock, and take dinner, at which time he would&#xD;
make such a response as lie found himself able to do.&#xD;
Hurrying home an hour earlier than usual, he presented&#xD;
the case to his wife. To him it was one of difficult&#xD;
solution. He had only two hundred dollars at coin-&#xD;
mand, for any purpose ; and this he had been husband-&#xD;
ing for Mrs. Friendly's trip to the Springs. With him,&#xD;
it was sacred; he could not touch a dollar of it. And&#xD;
yet how should lie deny that faithful and self-forgetting&#xD;
Missionary ?-a man who had severed himself from all&#xD;
the ties of home and kindred, to preach the glad tidings&#xD;
of salvation in a far-off land, amidst trials of'ill-health,&#xD;
poverty, hardships, and self-denial ! On the other&#xD;
hand, the claims of his sick wife twined about his&#xD;
heart ; they anticipated such beneficial results from the&#xD;
use of the sulphur water, that he had it not in his heart,&#xD;
to offer to deprive her of such a benefit.&#xD;
My dear," said the amiable and pious wife, " give&#xD;
yourself no uneasiness on my account; this is a call&#xD;
from God. Do not hesitate a moment, as to what you&#xD;
are to do with that money ; the silver and the gold are&#xD;
the Lord's ;give it unto Him ; His blessing is more to&#xD;
be desired than all else. Were I to refuse that poor&#xD;
Missionary, I should feel that I had refused the Saviour,&#xD;
&#xD;
;1&#xD;
((f&#xD;

'+ t&#xD;
!  Y&#xD;
Pr&#xD;
&#xD;
slighted His cause ; and then how could I ask his bless-&#xD;
ing? No, my husband, let me never, in my own&#xD;
wants, forget the wants of others; let me never, in con-&#xD;
tributing to my own comfort, forget the cause and the&#xD;
glory of Him, who, for my sake, became poor, and&#xD;
humbled, and despised on the earth."  "That is like&#xD;
my dear, good wife !" exclaimed Mr. Friendly, as the&#xD;
tears welled up in his eyes, and he pressed her to his&#xD;
heart, imprinting -a kiss on her wan, but smiling cheek.&#xD;
The missionary was cordially received, kindly enter-&#xD;
tained, and urged to make that his home during his&#xD;
stay in the city ; nor did he ever know the self-denial&#xD;
that that happy family made, to cheer his heart, and set&#xD;
forward the Redeemer's Kingdom.&#xD;
Had the little dinner party of the next day known&#xD;
all, they would likely have been more profuse in their&#xD;
comments on the folly of Mr. Friendly and his excel-&#xD;
lent wife. But the Lord knoweth how to reward them&#xD;
that are true of heart ;' and nogood thing will He with.&#xD;
hold from them that love Him. Commit thy way unto&#xD;
the Lord, and lie shall give thee thy heart's desire.&#xD;
By an apparent freak in the business world, which is by&#xD;
no means uncommon, a sudden rise in a particular&#xD;
article in Mr. Friendly's business, placed him in pos-&#xD;
session of -a surplus of six hundred dollars.&#xD;
As usual, he was greeted by his wife, at night, with a&#xD;
bright and cheerful smile ; and lie pressed her to his&#xD;
bosom, his whole frame trembling with emotions of&#xD;
joy: "You were right, my dear. The Lord will pro-&#xD;
vide. You shall go to the Springs, and, better than all,&#xD;
your dear husband will now accompany you." Never&#xD;
did any give up any thing unto the Lord, without find-&#xD;

ing a reward. 'The merciful goodness of the Lord&#xD;
endureth for ever and ever upon them that fear him;&#xD;
and His. righteousness upon children's children ; even&#xD;
upon such as keep His covenant, and think upon&#xD;
His commandments, to do them,' Ps. ciii. 1 , 18.&#xD;
And so they did go - to the Springs, where they&#xD;
spent two months ; and they returned in the Autumn,&#xD;
with the blessing of restored health to the grateful&#xD;
wife.&#xD;
But it is time to return to the dinner party. After&#xD;
Mr. Blemmerton and Mr. Nochurch retired, the ladies&#xD;
called Mr. Lovegood from his meditations, and scolded&#xD;
him a little, for so long depriving them of his company.&#xD;
He made due apologies, excusing himself on a score of&#xD;
a lack of gallantry; he knew his deficiencies in that&#xD;
respect, and anticipated an easy and merciful verdict.&#xD;
At this the ladies seemed to be particularly amused,&#xD;
especially because, as one of them  remarked, Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood was a gentleman of such rare, diversified&#xD;
talents, that he could not, if he tried, fail to make him-&#xD;
self remarkably agreeable everywhere.&#xD;
The remainder of the afternoon wore along, as pleas-&#xD;
atly as might have been anticipated. Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
was a little fidgety. Being out of his element, he&#xD;
longed to be in his study with his books; but he knew not&#xD;
bow to excuse himself at so early an hour. The ladies&#xD;
played and sang a few tunes; Miss Dele, with a good&#xD;
deal of feeling, sang the " Happy Wife," and " Home,&#xD;
sweet Home."   Mrs. Nochurch often went to the win-&#xD;
dow, and cast her eye down the street ; returning, she&#xD;
would give a knowing wink to Miss Dele, who seemed&#xD;
to be altogether innocent of its meaning. At last it had&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
299&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTIN S BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
been repeated so often, that some one of the company&#xD;
asked her whom she expected.&#xD;
With a very bland, but significant smile, and wink-&#xD;
ing again at Miss Dele, she remarked, in a negligent&#xD;
way, that she did not know, but she thought Mr. Slopill&#xD;
might possibly call in.  She knew that Mr. Slopill&#xD;
would not think of such a thing while Mrs. Blemmer-&#xD;
ton was present, for they were not "on terms."&#xD;
Miss Dele desired to know why Mrs. Nochurch&#xD;
looked at her. "Now, Dde !" exclaimed the lady,&#xD;
"are you niot ashamed ?" "No, indeed I'm not," said&#xD;
she, with affected indignation. " And it's high time&#xD;
that old stale story had come to an end. Mr. Slopill is&#xD;
nothing whatever to inc."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, being a matter-of-fact man, was some-&#xD;
what surprised to hear this, as he had heard the current&#xD;
gossip, that Miss Dde and Mr. Slopill were betrothed.&#xD;
It based him, notwithstanding he understood the con-&#xD;
ceded prerogative of young ladies to deny such stories;&#xD;
because it comported not with the character of a se-&#xD;
rious person, as Mrs. Blemnerton had represented&#xD;
her daughter to be,-a candidate for the honorable&#xD;
post of a Sunday-school teacher, and one ardently de-&#xD;
sirous of becoming a candidate for confirmation.&#xD;
Therefore, with some surprise, and in a tone mani-&#xD;
festing a strong presumption of doubt, he said, "I am&#xD;
surprised, Mis Blemmerton, to hear you speak thus ;&#xD;
and I must say, that, notwithstanding the. preroga-&#xD;
tive conceded to young ladies in such topics, it is bet-&#xD;
ter in some instances to be silent, than to commit one's&#xD;
self-"&#xD;

Dele cut the conversation short, with the observation,-&#xD;
"Indeed, Mr. Lovegood, you are greatly mistaken. In&#xD;
serious earnestness, and I hope you believe me, and&#xD;
shall be offended if you do not, there is no betroth ment&#xD;
now between me and Mr. Slopill ; and mother knows&#xD;
it !"  Mr. Lovegood was gallant enough not to disbe-&#xD;
lieve the solemn asseveration of a lady; and there the&#xD;
matter rested. A little while after, a suitable time having&#xD;
arrived, he was glad of an excuse to retire. And in due&#xD;
time the company all dispersed.&#xD;
" What a strange moment will that be,&#xD;
My soul, how full of curiosity,&#xD;
When winged and ready for thy eternal flight,&#xD;
On the utmost verges of thy tottering clay&#xD;
Hovering, and wishing longer stay,&#xD;
Thou shalt advance, and have eternity in sight !&#xD;
When just about to try that unknown sea,&#xD;
What a strange moment shall that be I"&#xD;
NoRIs of Bemerton: quotedfrom.Burnet's Lives.&#xD;
And now, if you follow Mr. Nochurch, from the&#xD;
moment that he parted company with Mr. Blemmeirton,&#xD;
you will find him going from hotel to hotel, in search of&#xD;
the Missionary, the Rev. Mr. Straggler, diligently exam-&#xD;
ining all the registers, in pursuit of his stopping-place.&#xD;
He has already inquired at a dozen of the principal&#xD;
hotels, without success.   There is but one more he&#xD;
thinks it necessary to inquire at; thither he bends his&#xD;
steps, opens the register, finds the name, but written&#xD;
after it in pencil, " Gone to Mr. Friendly's."  On inquir-&#xD;
ing, he found that Mr. Straggler had that day removed&#xD;
to Mr. Friendly's. le returned to his office, and pen-&#xD;
ned a brief line to the Missionary :&#xD;
&#xD;
" REv. SIR :-Please find enclosed $25, in aid of your&#xD;
work.&#xD;
"I regBret not meeting you, .when you called at my&#xD;
house to-day ; but hope it is not too late to do good.&#xD;
"Very faithfully, etc.&#xD;
" Rev. Mr. STRAGGLER.         W. NodiuiRto."&#xD;
Mr. Straggler was surprised, when he opened the&#xD;
note, to find so liberal a-donation from that house, and&#xD;
rightly surmised that Mr. Nochurch had not approbated&#xD;
the course of his wife. With his pencil lie marked the&#xD;
donation in his book, and after tea repaired to Mr.&#xD;
B emmerton's.&#xD;
Here a very different reception awaited hin. Mrs.&#xD;
Blemmerton, who appeared so fascinatingly gracious&#xD;
and condescending in the morning, did not show her-&#xD;
self at all. And Mr. Blemmerton, appearing to ~be in&#xD;
a particularly bad humor, informed him that he had&#xD;
been very unfortunate that day. He had entered into&#xD;
a contract to furnish a large quantity of a certain arti-&#xD;
cle, at a specified price ; and, while dining out, intelli-&#xD;
gence had been received in the city, which caused a&#xD;
sudden advance in it, and being obliged to buy at the&#xD;
advanced price and sell by his contract, he had lost by&#xD;
the operation about six hundred dollars, which had gone&#xD;
into the pockets of old Mr. Friendly,-a man to whom&#xD;
it would be of no service, as lie did not know the worth&#xD;
of money. "So much," continued he, " for a man's&#xD;
not being always at his post ; for, had I been at my&#xD;
counting-room, I could as easily as not have made the&#xD;
purchase of Friendly, before lie got intelligence of the&#xD;
rise. But it serves me right, I doubt not.&#xD;

" And you are begging for a church in , are&#xD;
you? Yes, I heard all about it. But, Sir, I must beg&#xD;
to be exused for not contributing to such an object.&#xD;
There are so many beggars now-a-days, that one caln&#xD;
scarcely keep a dollar in one's pocket. I gave away five&#xD;
thousand dollars last year, and got no thanks for it. And&#xD;
as to giving money to build a church in  ,it is quite&#xD;
out of the question. I might as well throw it away at&#xD;
once. What do they want with a church in   ? It is,&#xD;
I understand, filled up with horse-thieves, cut-throats, and&#xD;
robbers; and what do they care about the gospel? It&#xD;
is certainly useless, to send the gospel to such people."&#xD;
Beg your pardon, Sir," said Mr. Straggler, with be-&#xD;
coming dignity, "I did not suppose I should be quite&#xD;
accounted a beggar, in calling on wealthy Churchmen&#xD;
to aid a weak and struggling parish, to build a house&#xD;
unto the Lord. With that, however, I am content, if&#xD;
so be, I may but succeed. It is no disgrace nor dis-&#xD;
paragement to me, to share in the lot of him who was&#xD;
poor, desjised, and homeless on the earth.&#xD;
" But you must stand corrected, Mr. Blemmerton, in&#xD;
one respect.     is not made up, as you suppose, of&#xD;
the vile of the earth. That there are bad men in my&#xD;
State, I will not deny; and I am sorry to say they abound&#xD;
everywhere. I doubt whether your great city can boast&#xD;
exemption from them. We have, however, one conso-&#xD;
lation ; the bad men in our State were not reared there ;&#xD;
they came from the older States ; even your own State,&#xD;
Sir, produced not a few of them. But, take our citi-&#xD;
zens as a whole, there is not a more intelligent, active,&#xD;
industrious, law-abiding people in this country.&#xD;
" And yet, Sir, suppose I could admit the truth of&#xD;
&#xD;
your proposition, that the citizens composing my State&#xD;
are a set of thieves, cut-throats, and renegades, would&#xD;
it not prove the reverse of your assertion? Would it&#xD;
not be so much the more my duty, to preach the gospel&#xD;
of glad tidings among them ; and yours, to contribute&#xD;
unto its dissemination, that peradventure they might be&#xD;
brought unto repentance and a better mind, and re-&#xD;
claiimed from their wickedness? For, remember, our&#xD;
blessed Lord came not to call the righteous, but sinners&#xD;
to repentance. And His gracious invitation is, 'Come&#xD;
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I&#xD;
will give you rest.' "&#xD;
" Ha! ha ! ha! that is a pretty 'cute argument of&#xD;
yours, Mr. Straggler; a good argument, Sir! and I'll&#xD;
give you three dollars for it, for it's worth every penny&#xD;
of it."  So saying, Mr. Blemmerton walked into an ad-&#xD;
joining room, brought out the three dollars, which, hand-&#xD;
ing to the Missionary, he took out his subscription book&#xD;
and was about to enter it, when Mr. B. requested per-&#xD;
mission to examine it.&#xD;
" Mr. Nochurch, twenty-five dollars !" exclaimed he;&#xD;
"after the conversation to-day.! so strange, so wonder-&#xD;
ful! Some people will always be fools! Do not put&#xD;
my name down, Sir. No, Sir, I have no such vanity;&#xD;
besides, I rarely give in this way. I wait for the plate&#xD;
to come round in church. That I think the legitimate&#xD;
way to give; and then I always contribute. Don't put&#xD;
my name down, Sir; enter it cash. I didn't care for any&#xD;
one to know what I give. And bear in mind, if you&#xD;
please, that I give the three dollars as a reward to your&#xD;
acuteness, and not because I think that much of the&#xD;
people of your State. 'I have heard some curious sto-&#xD;

ries from that country. It is a great place for seeing&#xD;
elephants, mustangs, grizzly bears, wolves, and the like,&#xD;
I believe; and you like it, do you, Sir ?"  "Yes, Sir;&#xD;
because, I suppose, according to your estimate of it, I&#xD;
like misery !"&#xD;
"Pray, Sir, tell me whether I am not right in my rec-&#xD;
ollections of reading some of the Journals of your Di-&#xD;
ocesan Conventions, some years ago, in which there ap-&#xD;
peared some very amusing parochial reports. One, if I&#xD;
remember aright, read somehow in these words: ' Mat-&#xD;
ters are proceeding as usual in my parish; every thing&#xD;
is prosperous, and we have a good hope for the fuitre.&#xD;
Of the two communicants last reported, one has died&#xD;
and the other removed.' Another: 'After six years&#xD;
of indefatigable toil and anxiety, we have at last suc-&#xD;
ceeded in raising a vestry, and now we are fully organ-&#xD;
ized, signs are brightening wonderfully, and we trust&#xD;
now to move on with rapid strides.' I see little utility,&#xD;
Sir, as I said before, in sending money to build churches&#xD;
among such a people. It won't pay, Sir, you may de-&#xD;
pend; I had better contribute to some of the needy&#xD;
charities nearer home."&#xD;
"It is well, Sir, for you to look at home, and I hope&#xD;
you will liberally carry out that view. But, Sir, your&#xD;
jests fail of point, since they have no application in the&#xD;
Diocese to which I belong. You never read them in&#xD;
its parochial reports; you may have found them in the&#xD;
journals of some of the older dioceses. The Church in&#xD;
my diocese is weak ; but, one soul is of more worth&#xD;
than all the wealth and magnificence of your great city&#xD;
combined, and I would cheerfully labor all the days of&#xD;
my life in ,to save one soul from eternal ruin.&#xD;
&#xD;
And now, Mr. Blemmerton, do you think you have yet&#xD;
received the worth of your three dollars ? If not, I&#xD;
will remain until you take it all out in such wares."&#xD;
" 0 yes, Sir! I gave it freely, Sir, but would be pleased&#xD;
to have a little more of your company. Your people&#xD;
are very hospitable, are they not, Sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir,sich is their general character, and I be-&#xD;
lieve they deserve it. Hospitality is indicative of a&#xD;
good heart; aid no people I think can be ranked in so&#xD;
low a scale of humanity, as you are disposed to class the&#xD;
people of my State, who live in the daily exercise of&#xD;
such a virtue." " Could you give me an illustration,&#xD;
Sir?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, and a contrast if you like. A number of&#xD;
years ago, duty obliged me to take a journey, by stage,&#xD;
of about one hundred and fifty miles, to the capital of&#xD;
my State. The first day, we made about fifty miles,&#xD;
and lodged all night at a hotel on the road. Early in&#xD;
the morning, we got off; and, after proceeding about&#xD;
thirty miles, I discovered that I had left my gold watch,&#xD;
the valuable and valued gift of a very dear friend, under&#xD;
my pillow at the hotel where I had lodged. In an&#xD;
hour's ride, we reached the next hotel on the road.&#xD;
As we approachedII saw in a field a few rods off, a&#xD;
gentleman whom I had never met, and with whom I&#xD;
had no personal acquaintance, who was engaged with&#xD;
his hands in his farming operations. While we tarried&#xD;
for dinner, he walked over to the hotel and I made his&#xD;
acquaintance. In the course of conversation, I informed&#xD;
him of my misfortune; just then, the return stage drove&#xD;
up. He called a servant from his plough in the field,&#xD;
told him my story, 'And now,' said he, 'Bill, do you&#xD;

take the stage, and go back to Gunter's, and get this&#xD;
gentleman's watch.' I protested that it was too much&#xD;
for him to do, but it was useless; neither would he per-&#xD;
mit me to pay Pill's fare, nor even make him a present;&#xD;
he did all this himself.&#xD;
" After dinner, we proceeded on our journey. I&#xD;
reached my destination. The Legislature was in ses-&#xD;
sion. On the third day after my arrival, I was stand-&#xD;
ing, about midday, in the hall of the State House,&#xD;
loojdng down the avenue that led to it, when I beheld&#xD;
the gentleman walking up, my big watch-seal dangling&#xD;
at his side. Think of it, Sir. He had sent his servant&#xD;
a journey, at a heavy expense, and now had taken one&#xD;
himself, all out of kindness to a stranger."&#xD;
"But what has that to do with hospitality ?"  " Hear&#xD;
me out, Sir. 'Sir, I am under very many obligations&#xD;
to you; how can I sufficiently show my gratitude?&#xD;
What am I to pay, Sir ? Surely, you will permit me&#xD;
to pay Bills expenses, Sir?'&#xD;
"'No, Sir, not one cent. But I have a charge to&#xD;
make against you, Sir.' ' o, Sir, do say what it is; I&#xD;
shall be too glad to comply with it if in my power.'&#xD;
That you call on your return homeward, and spend&#xD;

" And did you do it, Sir ?" exclaimed Mr. Blem-&#xD;
morton. "He excused me with three weeks; and I&#xD;
never spent so pleasant a time, in my life; and when&#xD;
it expired, he sent me home in his own carriage.&#xD;
This will give you an idea of the hospitality of my&#xD;
State."&#xD;
" And what of the contrast, Sir ?"  " Ah! I can give&#xD;
you a couple of them, if you wish. Take the least first.&#xD;

I was on a visit to a friend ; in what part of the world&#xD;
I need not name. About night, a carriage drove up,&#xD;
and a very intelligent lady and gentleman alighted,&#xD;
who proved to be Mr. and Mrs. Tighter, from a village&#xD;
some fifty miles off. They were exceedingly delighted,&#xD;
once more to see their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Hearty,&#xD;
with whom I was staying. Mr. and Mrs. Hearty re-&#xD;
ceived them very kindly, and entertained them hospita-&#xD;
bly. They had not met before, for a number of years.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Tighter were taking something of a pleas-&#xD;
ure trip, and going on a visit to some distant relatives,&#xD;
and had taken Mr. and Mrs. hearty's home in the way.&#xD;
It was pleasant for old acquaintances thus to meet; and&#xD;
our hosts played the agreeable, very handsomely. The&#xD;
carriage was put away, the horse cared for, and our&#xD;
friends passed a delightful evening. After breakfast&#xD;
the next morning, several bandboxes were brought in,&#xD;
and Mrs. Tighter opened one and displayed several&#xD;
handsome bonnets. She had just taken them along,&#xD;
she said, on sale. She thought some of her friends&#xD;
might want a handsome bonnet, and it would assist in&#xD;
paying expenses; she asked but a very small profit.&#xD;
Mrs. Hearty of course had to buy a bonnet for sake of&#xD;
' auld lang sync,' paying therefor a dollar more than she&#xD;
could have procured it for in the nearest village."&#xD;
Mr. Blemnerton is getting a little fidgety. "The&#xD;
trade being over," continued the Missionary, "the car-&#xD;
riage drove up, Mr. and Mrs. Tighter took a hearty&#xD;
leave, urging Mr. and Mrs. Hearty to pay them a visit.&#xD;
'Tightervilie,' said Mrs. Tighter, 'is, as you know, a&#xD;
most charming place,-indeed the most charming you&#xD;
ever saw ; and I can assure you, that there is one of the&#xD;

best hotels there the country can produce. 0 you&#xD;
would spend such a delightful time ; do come."&#xD;
Mr. Elemmerton .gives the Missionary an icy look.&#xD;
le continues, " A friend of mine returned to his&#xD;
native land to get married. Of course he put up at the&#xD;
village hotel, whose proprietor, it seems, had married&#xD;
the sister of his intended wife. This gentleman was&#xD;
very wealthy, had amassed a fortune by hotel-keeping.&#xD;
My friend remained at the hotel, until the day of mar-&#xD;
riage, paid his bill, and removed his baggage to his&#xD;
father-in-law's. After spending a week or so, the time&#xD;
arrived for him to take his bride to her new home.&#xD;
The carriage was at the door, the baggage lashed on&#xD;
behind, the bride and groom in, the whip cracks, and&#xD;
they are about to drive off, when the brother-in-law, the&#xD;
hotel-keeper, in breathless anxiety came running up,&#xD;
Stop! stop ! stop!' exclaimed he; ' here, Mr.  , a&#xD;
little mistake, a slight omission, I forgot it in your bill,&#xD;
eighteempencefoir washing three skirts.'"&#xD;
By this- time, Mr. Blemmerton was properly roasting&#xD;
with his own choler. The Missionary, thinking that he&#xD;
had given him the worth of his money, retired'; and&#xD;
we opine, that Mr. John Blemmerton dislikes all mis-&#xD;
sionaries. Nor are we surprised at it ; his three dollars&#xD;
gone, foiled im his witticisms, and cut adrift, on his own&#xD;
uncomfortable reflections. All this was quite sufficient&#xD;
to render him taciturn, peevish, and unhappy.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
SHOWING AGNES' PROGRESS AT MRS. DENSMORE'S. SOME-&#xD;
THING MORE ABOUT MR. BEN SLOoUM, DR. RIPROARER,&#xD;
AND DR. SKYROCKET.&#xD;
WE have paused to give neither day nor date as we&#xD;
have proceeded. The events already related cover a&#xD;
series of years. Agnes Wallace has been upwards of&#xD;
two years at Mrs. Densmore's school ; has made rapid&#xD;
progress; and has become a universal favorite with the&#xD;
household. Mrs. Densmore's monthly reports to Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood, of her progress, are highly gratifying;&#xD;
every thing in  St.    's congregation appears to be&#xD;
quiet and prosperous. Mr. Lovegood remains in total&#xD;
ignorance of the disgraceful reports that are floating&#xD;
about town, in regard to himself.&#xD;
It has for. a long time been rumored, that he and Dele&#xD;
Blemmerton are to be married. She denied it, on all&#xD;
occasions ; but the knowing ones did not give her credit&#xD;
for speaking the truth. Every body said it was- so ; and&#xD;
what every body says must be true.&#xD;
The ugly alley matter, too, has eked out, which is&#xD;
corroborated by John Fussy's story. These reports&#xD;
gained strength and received additions, as they passed&#xD;
from one to another; and they were fast gathering into&#xD;
a portentous cloud, which threatened to create a deluge.&#xD;
Each of the busy-bodies added to the original story,&#xD;
until it was magnified beyond the most sanguine antici-&#xD;
pations of the original inventors.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, it was said by one, had been seen&#xD;
coming from the theatre at midnight; had been seen&#xD;
standing at a suspicious corner ; coming out of an alle&#xD;
going into a groggery. Some were not sure that he&#xD;
had not been seen lying in a gutter; others were quite&#xD;
certain, that he had been seen in a state of intoxication.&#xD;
Some, of course, glad to get any thing against a clergy-&#xD;
man, believed, or pretended to do so, all these reports;&#xD;
others treated them as they deserved, giving them no&#xD;
credit whatever.&#xD;
Poor Mr. Lovegood was certainly getting into an&#xD;
uncomfortable predicament ; but he was as profoundly&#xD;
ignorant of it all as an infant. He was about to be,&#xD;
married, without his knowledge or consent ; his gown&#xD;
was about to be taken off, on account of his drunkenness&#xD;
and a hundred other offences, of which he was just as&#xD;
innocent.&#xD;
We pause not to draw a full picture of all that was&#xD;
said or done ; how inquiries were made, surmises&#xD;
founded, reports corroborated.  The great Book of&#xD;
Life's Experiences has many a dark and darkened page,&#xD;
written in gall and tears of blood, and blotched all over&#xD;
with venon on such topics: let that suffice.&#xD;
The Blemmertons, as it appeared to suit their interests,&#xD;
observed a profound silence ; if they took sides at all,&#xD;
it was thought they rather favored Mr. Lovegood.&#xD;
Mrs. Blemmerton gave Mrs. Fussy a hint, that if these&#xD;
reports were true, Mr. Lovegood could never marry&#xD;
Deliah Airmyth; that was a settled point. But she&#xD;
could not believe they were true, although it looked&#xD;
suspicious: there was so much smoke, she feared there&#xD;
must be some fire.&#xD;
&#xD;
And here we must take up the thread of the history&#xD;
of Mr. Ben Slocum Sapientium. After the conversa-&#xD;
tion, recorded in a former chapter, between him and&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, in which, it will be remembered, he&#xD;
placed himself under Mr. Lovegood's guidance as a&#xD;
candidate for confirmation, Mr. Ben Slocum threw&#xD;
himself in the way of a Presbyterian Elder, at whose&#xD;
house Sally Fastidious was a frequent visitor, and re-&#xD;
ported to him the purport, as well as he could, of the&#xD;
conference between himself and Mr. Lovegood.  The&#xD;
elder rubbed his hands in an ecstasy of delight. It&#xD;
was the sweetest nut he had cracked for many weary&#xD;
years.&#xD;
He readily gained Ben's consent, to bring the matter&#xD;
to the notice of Dr. Riproarer ; and it was agreed, that&#xD;
an appointment should be made for him to meet Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer, at the house of the elder that evening, at&#xD;
which time and place Mr. Slocum was to -make an&#xD;
exhibit of all the books that had been placed in his&#xD;
hands by Mr. Lovegood. True to the appointment, Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer was in place ; and Ben appeared with his&#xD;
books. Dr. Rip examines them, one by one.&#xD;
" Just as I expected," said he, " all on the uncharita-&#xD;
ble, unchurchin g order. Beaven's Help to Catechising.&#xD;

tion, eh ?-what flummery! - Ha! Percival on the&#xD;

All pretty books to make a man a Christian. Mr.&#xD;
Benjamin Slocum Sapientium, I must say to you'in all&#xD;
charity, that if you read these detestable books, you&#xD;
might as well go and be a "Catholic " at once. For&#xD;

DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Confirmation and the Apostolic Succession both are&#xD;
held by the Catholics; and if you are going to be a&#xD;
Catholic, go and join them at once. Away with such&#xD;
trash ! You have been attending my church ever since&#xD;
you were a little boy, and you have never heard any&#xD;
thing about such stuff."&#xD;
Dr. Riproarer never uttered a more sublime truism&#xD;
in his life, than that last sentence. Mr. Slocum had&#xD;
never heard any thing about such " stuff," from his&#xD;
pulpit. But we opine, if he could work up a little&#xD;
more of such "stuff" as he calls it, in his system,&#xD;
he would be able to draw a distinction between Ro-&#xD;
manism and Catholicism, and it would savor a little&#xD;
more of the true Catholic and Apostolic Doctrines.&#xD;
If Dr. Rip's argument, that Apostolic Succession and&#xD;
Confirmation ought to be rejected, because Ronie&#xD;
holds them, be good, for consistency's sake, he ought&#xD;
also to reject the Bible, and Prayer, and Praise, and&#xD;
the Sacraments, and Preaching, because Rome holds&#xD;
them.&#xD;
But this was not the only "stuff" Mr. Slocum had&#xD;
failed to hear from Dr. Rip's pulpit ; or, if he ever had&#xD;
heard it, he had not the mind to grasp it. Dr. Rip's&#xD;
high-toned Calvinism, absolute, unconditional predesti-&#xD;
nation to eternal life or death; had he heard it, and&#xD;
possessed ordinary powers of ratiocination, lie would&#xD;
never have sought such a guide in spiritual things, on&#xD;
the principle that if he were (according to the supra-&#xD;
lapsarian, before the fall, or according to the sublapsa-&#xD;
ian, after the fall) predestinated either to salvation or&#xD;
damnation, he need give himself little concern about&#xD;
&#xD;
it, since nothing that he could do would alter the case,&#xD;
one way or the other.*&#xD;
" Now, Mr. Ben Slocum," continued the Doctor, "I&#xD;
hope you will read none of these books. To speak&#xD;
plainly, they are little better than spiritual poison. All&#xD;
that you have to do, Sir, is to 'get religion.' And to&#xD;
aid you in this work, here is a charming and precious&#xD;
little book, which I will place in your hands. And to&#xD;
show you my unbiased judgment, and unbounded&#xD;
liberality, you may see from  the title-page it is by an&#xD;
EpiscOpal clergyman, the Rev. Dr. Skyrocket, a man&#xD;
of extensive learning and piety, an ornament to his&#xD;
Church, a Christian in the true sense of the word, whom&#xD;
I will endorse any and every where. I do not ask you&#xD;
to read Presbyterian books ; read that book, Sir, an&#xD;
Episcopal book; it will open your eyes, and you will&#xD;
see what all this pretension about the Apostolic Succes-&#xD;
sion, etc., is worth.&#xD;
" Dr. Skyrocket, like a good Christian, and a liberal-&#xD;
minded, intelligent man, acknowledges our Church and&#xD;
orders to be as valid as his. He prefers Episcopacy,&#xD;
not because it is of divine appointment, but because he&#xD;
likes it best. I prefer Presbyterianism; and so I hope&#xD;
you do, Mr. Ben Slocum."&#xD;
* The Presbyterians of the present day affect to derive great com-&#xD;
fort from our 17th Article of Religion. Strange, that they should be&#xD;
willing to look in this direction for comfort ! How far they are privi-&#xD;
leged to derive comfort from the aforesaid Article, may be gathered&#xD;
from the opposition which it met at the hands of the Calvinistic party,&#xD;
at the period it was first proposed. See Hardwick's Lambeth Articles.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
And we opine from Dr. Skyrocket's book, that he&#xD;
would have found more sympathy and congeniality in&#xD;
the bosom of Presbyterianism than lie found in the&#xD;
Church. His sympathies were all with them ; and his&#xD;
works, from time to time, had been of very great service&#xD;
to Presbyterianism, since, in all such cases as that of&#xD;
Mr. Ben Slocum, they had been extensively used, in&#xD;
proselyting weak, unstable, and uninstructed members&#xD;
of the Church into that system. We will, however, do&#xD;
Dr. Skyrocket the justice to say, that that was not his&#xD;
intenion. H~e was a sincere man, aiming merely to&#xD;
disseminate his principles of liberality, and manifesi&#xD;
his freedom from every taint of "bigotry" and "un-&#xD;
charitableness." These he considered weaknesses, be-&#xD;
neath the dignity of a man of spirit and independence ;&#xD;
to be tied up to forms and creeds was abhorrent to his&#xD;
feelings. His theological acquirements were very limit-&#xD;
ed; he had never sounded the depths of theological&#xD;
learning ; he had never breathed a thorough Church&#xD;
atmosphere ; and therefore it was not to be expected&#xD;
of him, that he should recognize the Church as a great&#xD;
Institution set up in the world by her divine Lord for&#xD;
the salvation of sinners.&#xD;
Like numbers who tampered with Rome, until they&#xD;
were carried into her arms or crushed beneath her&#xD;
serpent-like coils, he had tampered with Sectarianism,&#xD;
until he was completely under its control. And the&#xD;
praises and high-sounding eulogies of his sectarian&#xD;
friends, had a fascination, whose chain, had he so desired,&#xD;
he could not have broken.&#xD;
Mr. Benjamin Slocum Sapientium read the flaming&#xD;
book of Dr. Skyrocket. Perhaps, he did. We do not&#xD;

assert the fact; we rather doubt, whether I3en ever read&#xD;
much of any thing.. But the result was just as certain;&#xD;
all his protestations to Mr. Lovegood vanished, and, of&#xD;
course, he came out, a drilled, decided, and triumphant&#xD;
Presbyterian. How much "religion he got," we un-&#xD;
dertake not to answer. This we know: it was duly&#xD;
announced, that the new convert would be received into&#xD;
connection with the Presbyteriai meeting, on the fol-&#xD;
lowing Sunday. Of course, it was a great and thrilling&#xD;
event, in the history of Dr. Riproarer's ministry ; nor&#xD;
did he and his congregation fail to improve it, to the&#xD;
full extent. It was a decided and magnificent triumph;&#xD;
and will doubtless be recorded with due honor and&#xD;
prominence in the history of Presbyterianism, as it is&#xD;
handed down to posterity. Requiescat in pace. No !&#xD;
Emblazon it on the banner and give it to the breeze !&#xD;
It is a trophy that Dr. Riproarer can well afford to exult&#xD;
in : he is welcome to it, we envy him not. All this&#xD;
while, Mr. Lovegood has been kept in profound igno-&#xD;
rance oft hese manouvres, He has often met and con-&#xD;
versed with Ben Slocumi; but never the slightest hint&#xD;
of this piece of wire-working has he received, either&#xD;
from him or his aunt, who was privy to it.&#xD;
Now here was a capital"hit for Dr. Riproarer; a re-&#xD;
prisal from  Mr. Lovegood's flock; a member of the&#xD;
Blemmerton family, wlo, all their lives, had been iden-&#xD;
tified with that mummeryy," Episcopacy! Presbyte-&#xD;
rianism was looking up. Dr.Riproarer could certainly&#xD;
afford to lift his hat and make a respectful bow for such&#xD;
a favor,-"11Knock-heads," as the Chinese say. It booted&#xD;
nothing to him, that poor Ben knew not enough about&#xD;

question in the Catechism. We ask his pardon; per-&#xD;
Iaps had the direct question, "What is your name&#xD;
been propounded to him, he might have answered,&#xD;
" Benjamin Slocum." But he never could have an-&#xD;
swered the second question. And this, it is true, was&#xD;
not so much his fault, as that of his uncle and aunt, by&#xD;
whom he had been brought up. Still, it robs Presby-&#xD;
terianism of all ground of exultation, since Mr. Slocum&#xD;
had no idea of discriminating between truth and false-&#xD;
hood. He was about to become a Presbyterian; be-&#xD;
cause policy dictated it, not because he thought Pres-&#xD;
byterianism, par excellence, the truth. So far as he&#xD;
had been trained at all, religiously, he had been reared&#xD;
in the school of indifferentism; and now he was led&#xD;
entirely by what he supposed to be his interests. Sally&#xD;
Fastidious attended Dr. Rip's services altogether. It&#xD;
was a great reprisal; a "big-guni" affair, and the most&#xD;
was to be made of it.&#xD;
Dr. Riproarer undoubtedly understood the whole&#xD;
matter; but, thankful for small favors, few and far be-&#xD;
tween as they were, he joyed, as Pythagoras did, when&#xD;
he discovered his great geometrical problem; and, for&#xD;
aught that we know, had he possessed them, he would&#xD;
have sacrificed as many oxen; or as Archimedes did,&#xD;
when he discovered the specific gravity of metals.&#xD;
And had he, like the philosopher, been bathing, he&#xD;
would have rushed out of the bath, exclaiming, "I have&#xD;
found it! I have found it!"&#xD;
Found what, Sir? "Mr. Benjamin Slocum Sapien-&#xD;
tium, the nephew of Mr. John Blemmerton, is a Pres-&#xD;
byterian."  Whew! you have found a "mare's nest,"&#xD;
indeed. It was a capital hit, we say, for Dr. Riproarer;&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.             817&#xD;
and he improved it, having in mind, no doubt, an aw-&#xD;
ful consideration of all the gossip floating about to Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood's prejudice. The next Sunday night, the fact&#xD;
was duly announced, that Mr. Ben Slocum had made a&#xD;
happy exit, after a searching examination and many&#xD;
painful mental struggles, from the errors of Episcopacy;&#xD;
and had been duly received into union with the Presby-&#xD;
terian meeting.&#xD;
The Doctor put on his happiest expression, while&#xD;
making the announcement; congratulated his young&#xD;
friend on his triumphant conversion, and urged him to&#xD;
persevere,-a thing that he knew, according to his sys-&#xD;
tem, lie would do. The evening's service wound up&#xD;
with a "scorching sermon," as Mr. Nochurch charac-&#xD;
terized it, on the pretensions of some bigoted, uncharit-&#xD;
able Episcopalians, in which the Rev. Doctor did not&#xD;
omit to dwell, with a scathing burst of indignant elo-&#xD;
quence, on the shamefulness of clerical delinquencies&#xD;
in general; and especially on the use of the smallest&#xD;
amount of ardent spirits by a clergyman, except in&#xD;
cases of sickness,-an exception which the doctor often&#xD;
needed for his personal benefit. In truth, he was bold&#xD;
to say, that lie had no confidence in any clergyman&#xD;
who did not belong to a temperance society.&#xD;
"A fine hit, that !" declared Aunt Sally Milk-and-&#xD;
water, who had gone with the crowd, on this memora-&#xD;
ble occasion; " a fine hit, that! A sorry set all preach-&#xD;
ers must have been, before temperance societies were&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
A DISCOVERY. AN IRISH ROW. A MORSEL OF CHARITY.&#xD;
" LA ! if there be'int a funeral," ejaculated Mrs. Fus-&#xD;
sy's girl Jane, as she loitered at the back-gate of her&#xD;
premises one afternoon, a few weeks later than the&#xD;
groggery story started. She ran in to inform Mrs. Fus.&#xD;
sy, that a funeral procession was moving out from the&#xD;
residence of Pat O'Ryman. " And sure enough, if Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood be'int at the head of it."&#xD;
The hearse moved slowly out of the alley, followed&#xD;
by a few Irishmen and women, and proceeded to the&#xD;
burial-ground. " Why, Jane, who is dead ?" inquired&#xD;
Mrs. Fussy, with evident concern. "I don't know,&#xD;
Marm; may be it's Miss O'IRyman ; I'll run over and&#xD;
see."&#xD;
Mrs. O'Ryman was dead. She had lived within a&#xD;
stone's throw of Mrs. Fussy, for a number of years, and&#xD;
now had been gradually sinking to the grave, for the&#xD;
last six months, under the slow lingering tortures of&#xD;
a cancer ; and though she was ill so long, and so long&#xD;
residing near her; a partaker with her, too, at the same&#xD;
altar ; a co-worshipper in the same sanctuary ; Mrs.&#xD;
Fussy scam cely knew that such a being existed ; through&#xD;
all her sickness, she had never sent a kind inquiry af-&#xD;
ter her, nor proffered the slightest token of Christian&#xD;
sympathy. Alas! that we should have to record so&#xD;
painful a reminiscence.&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
319&#xD;
&#xD;
318&#xD;
&#xD;
But true, too true is it, that the heavenly doctrine of&#xD;
the Communion of Saints, the great Brotherhood of the&#xD;
Church, has been painfully lost sight of, or merged into&#xD;
the over-masteri ng aims, ends, and interests of the pres-&#xD;
cut life. We know that it has been nobly urged, that&#xD;
the Church possesses all the elements that are required,&#xD;
for a display of the most active charity towards the&#xD;
world at large and her own children in particular; and&#xD;
hence some, whose opinions we venerate, have taken a&#xD;
stand of opposition to Church Brotherhoods, cu the true&#xD;
ground that the whole Church is a Brotherhood, and&#xD;
that it is only necessary to use and develop the means&#xD;
in hand, to carry out the glowing and glorious chari-&#xD;
ties of the Gospel.&#xD;
In the abstract, this is a glorious truth. But, if the&#xD;
Church has failed in her organic capacity, in any re-&#xD;
spect, to meet the demands of poor trembling humani-&#xD;
ty ; or, if her children have failed to strengthen her&#xD;
hands, may not poor humanity cry aloud for succor,&#xD;
and reach forth her feeble hand to grasp the next best&#xD;
thing that proffers relief or comfort ?&#xD;
The writer has but an humble opinion to offer, and&#xD;
he offers it with fear and trembling ; but he believes it&#xD;
to be the true view. The Church is a great Brother-&#xD;
hood ; the greater contains the less ; let the less go on,&#xD;
to accomplish what it can ; its influence will enlarge,&#xD;
until all shall be absorbed in the greater. It is, we rev-&#xD;
erently believe, a movement ill the right direction,-a&#xD;
curative of a great evil. We think its grand effect is,&#xD;
to be a fuller and more appreciat iv;e recognition of the&#xD;
great Brotherhood.&#xD;
Small Brotherhoods, of activity, within the circle of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7334-00000161"/>&#xD;
a great Brotherhood, long too inactive! Is there any&#xD;
contradiction involved-herein? No more, we apprehend,&#xD;
than there is in the working of each independent par-&#xD;
ish, in subjection to the federative principle of all the&#xD;
parishes, in a Diocese ; or of each independent Dio-&#xD;
cese, in subjection to the federative principle of the&#xD;
whole Church.&#xD;
The Church possesses all necessary elements, but it&#xD;
must be granted that they are inactive, at least for all&#xD;
the purposes that are required. Where are we to be.&#xD;
gin to effect the cure? Certainly we must aim at the&#xD;
seat of the disease. The disease lies in the Church's&#xD;
children ; her children, then, must be exercised ; and&#xD;
this is the work proposed by the lesser Brotherhoods,&#xD;
working within the circle of the greater. " All true&#xD;
remedy," Leighton says, "must begin at the heart;&#xD;
otherwise, it will be but a mountebank cure, a false im-&#xD;
agined conquest."&#xD;
Another thing must be granted, that the Church, in&#xD;
her organic capacity, has failed in duty ; for, she bears&#xD;
towards her children the authority of a loving spiritual&#xD;
mother, which authority she has not fully carried out in&#xD;
a wholesome and loving discipline. She has, from&#xD;
time to time, here and there, allowed too much of the&#xD;
spirit of independency, too much of the spirit of indi-&#xD;
vidualizing Christianity. It is her province to define&#xD;
and enforce terms of membership; and in all respects to&#xD;
carry out and develop the primary laws of the Gospel.&#xD;
The only terms of membership are Baptism; this she&#xD;
has clearly defined. But she has not so clearly defined&#xD;
the duties springing out of that membership ; or, at&#xD;
&#xD;
E.&#xD;
&#xD;

least, she does allow, in her individual pastors, in many&#xD;
instances, too meagre a performance of them. She&#xD;
must take a more decided stand against worldliness.&#xD;
Worldliness has continued to usurp, until it has well-&#xD;
nigh eked out her powers of life, and powers of disci-&#xD;
pline. This must be remedied, by a return to some-&#xD;
thing like the primitive rule, of laying apart on the first&#xD;
day of the week. It involves a weekly offertory, which&#xD;
the Church, in her organic capacity, ought to enforce, as&#xD;
she clearly has the right to enforce ; i. e., so far as the&#xD;
opportunity to give is concerned; she can constrain&#xD;
the clergy to do their part of it.&#xD;
Again : when it is seen that numbers of her children,&#xD;
and those, we mean, who are partakers at her altar of&#xD;
the "IBread of Life," are devoted, soul and body, to the&#xD;
world, what are we to expect but meagre charities?&#xD;
charities that mock the poor, and put a scandal on the&#xD;
Gospel. And is the Church, in her organic capacity,&#xD;
not relax here? Has she no power of discipline to&#xD;
remedy such an evil? How comports it with the duty&#xD;
of communicants of the Church, to contribute fifty cents,&#xD;
or a mere mite, to the great charities of the Gospel,&#xD;
when, the next day, perhaps, they spend a thousand&#xD;
dollars in a ball or party, to meet the demands of fash-&#xD;
ion? And yet, dare we blind our eyes to such facts as&#xD;
are daily staring us in the face ? And has the Church&#xD;
no remedial power? She has. She has discipline: and&#xD;
it should be well defined. She should speak out, in her&#xD;
organic strength, against such evils ; and they who&#xD;
would not be willing, in some good measure, to yield&#xD;
them, should at least be made to take their right posi-&#xD;

tion within her folds. "Ye cannot serve God and&#xD;
Mammon." Let the Church enforce it more fully, dis-&#xD;
tinctly, and determinedly upon their children. Until&#xD;
this is done, we say, All Hail the Brotherhoods, as the&#xD;
best thing we can have. It is but the big heart of&#xD;
the Church, yearning and throbbing through the hearts&#xD;
of her children. What the many will not accomplish,&#xD;
the few will ; and we bid them God-speed, until the&#xD;
whole Brotherhood, in its strength, shall be aroused&#xD;
into a life-breathing activity.&#xD;
But, to return to our story. The residence of Pat&#xD;
O'Ryman was a dilapidated old building, which stood&#xD;
in an alley, just in the rear , of Mrs. Fussy's princely&#xD;
mansion, and had but two rooms, and one entrance.&#xD;
There was an attic, but it was merely a receptacle for&#xD;
old lumber and rubbish.&#xD;
The front room is occupied as a "Bar-room," in.&#xD;
which Pat O'Ryman deals out the liquid fire to his cus-&#xD;
tomers; a set of low filthy Irishmen, who spend with&#xD;
him, in drunken brawls, every penny they can rake and&#xD;
scrape together. And when they are penniless, and&#xD;
can succeed in getting Pat half drunk, he "thrusts&#xD;
them for the sake o' the ould counthry."&#xD;
Just before the door, inside, stands the necessary ap-&#xD;
pendage to a groggery, a painted lattice-work screen,&#xD;
which serves to save the passer-by from many an un-&#xD;
seemly, unsightly carousal. Were you to enter that&#xD;
wretched place, you would find a few rickety chairs, an&#xD;
old bespittled stove, a sanded floor, covered with tobac-&#xD;
co juice and relics of the quid; a few empty whiskey&#xD;
barrels, scattered promiscuously about ; a small coun-&#xD;
ter, at which the glass is served ; and, behind it, a row&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              323&#xD;
or two of shelves, holding the labelled bottles, which&#xD;
contain the fire-water.&#xD;
Pat O'Ryman is, himself, a perfect specimen of an&#xD;
Irish groggery-keeper; a pock-fretted face; a red nose,&#xD;
that looks as though it were half roasted ; one eye a lit-&#xD;
tle red and blood-shotten, the other slightly blackened;&#xD;
shaggy hair; -a full florid face. The landlord stands&#xD;
behind his "Bar,"-which means, we suppose, that it&#xD;
"bars" all intruders from the delectable labelled bot-&#xD;
tles,-in his red flannel shirt, the sleeves of which are&#xD;
rolled up to the armpit, exhibiting the marks of indel-&#xD;
ible ink wrought into the skin in the shape of an an-&#xD;
clior and a sprig of shamrock. He is mixing glasses&#xD;
for two or three Irishmen, who lazily hang on the coun-&#xD;
ter in a state of anxious waiting, while half a dozen more&#xD;
of the same kidney lounge about the room,-some on&#xD;
the rickety chairs, some on the empty barrels, smoking&#xD;
their pipes, sipping their toddy, and singing their Irish&#xD;
bacchanalian songs. One fellow, having indulged a&#xD;
little too freely in potations of the " crather," has slip-&#xD;
ped from his barrel, and lies by it on the floor, a rather&#xD;
forbidding specimen of humanity.&#xD;
how long, 0 Lord, holy and true, shall humanity be&#xD;
inflicted with such gateways to Hell!&#xD;
In the back room, there is what must pass for a bed,&#xD;
on which reclines the sick wife of Pat O'Ryman.&#xD;
There also hangs from the wall a dingy looking-glass,&#xD;
that has the appearance of having displayed the beau-&#xD;
ties of the O'Ryman family for many generations.&#xD;
There is also an old chest or two about the room, on the&#xD;
top of which burns a lamp, which emits a dull, dingy,&#xD;
smoky light.&#xD;

<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7334-00000163"/>&#xD;
324     THE BLEMMERTONS; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
Pat O'Ryman was himself a Romanist, and felt that&#xD;
all he needed was " extreme unction" at the last mo-&#xD;
ment; but his wife had been brought up in the United&#xD;
Church of England and Ireland, and notwithstanding&#xD;
the threats of Pat, and the anathemas of Father Don-&#xD;
neghan, had remained true to the Faith. When she&#xD;
was taken sick, Pat insisted on sending for Father Don-&#xD;
neghan, but she as strenuously refused to have his ser-&#xD;
vices. And so matters stood, until Mr. Lovegood, miss-&#xD;
ing her from the Communion, called one day to ascer-&#xD;
tain the cause of her absence, and found her as we have&#xD;
described.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood had never had an assistant; and noxx&#xD;
he found his hands full of parochial duty, visiting the&#xD;
sick, ministering to the needy and the afflicted, inso-&#xD;
much that he was frequently on duty all night, at the&#xD;
bedside of the sick or dying, in the lordly palace, or the&#xD;
wretched hovel. About ten o'clock, on the night when&#xD;
Master John Fussy saw him come out of the alley, the&#xD;
faithful pastor had entered the groggery of Pat O'Ry-&#xD;
man. As we have stated before, there was but one&#xD;
entrance ; and he was obliged to pass through the&#xD;
crowd of half drunken Irishmen, to enter the room&#xD;
of the sick woman. And we must say, to. their credit,&#xD;
that, as soon as they looked upon him, and learned the&#xD;
nature of his mission, they became silent, gave him a&#xD;
respectful bow, and opened a way for him to pass into&#xD;
the back room. There he found the sick woman suffer-&#xD;
ing great pain, bearing unmistakable marks of neglect,&#xD;
worn out with the incessant fumes of whiskey and the&#xD;
pipe from the tap-room, and the horrible oaths and im-&#xD;
precations that ever and anon jarred upon her ear. We&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             325&#xD;
can scarcely picture to ourselves a more wretched and&#xD;
pitiable condition, for one who needed quiet for the&#xD;
body's sake, and the consolations of religion for the&#xD;
preparation of the soul for its passage into the Spirit-&#xD;
land.&#xD;
How awful a type of the wretchedness of lost spirits&#xD;
in that world of woe, where the sunlight of God's coun-&#xD;
tenance cometh not ! Oaths, imprecations, blasphe-&#xD;
mies, rendered all the night horrible, making a hell&#xD;
upon earth.&#xD;
0, what a comfort to the afflicted and dying woman,&#xD;
was the presence of the man of God! Even the&#xD;
impious blasphemer was silent before him; the besot-&#xD;
ted, brutal bacchanalian ceased his horrid oaths; and,&#xD;
for the first time during many weary nights, did that&#xD;
den of darkness, filth, and wickedness, fail to resound&#xD;
with its horrible and maddening orgies.&#xD;
But quiet was destined not long to remain. There&#xD;
had long been a feud brewing, between Pat O'lRyman&#xD;
and Tim Limpkins, his brother-in-law, who kept a grog-&#xD;
gery in a neighboring alley, about some bedding, a&#xD;
frying-pan, a tea-kettle, and a few other articles, the&#xD;
property of the mother of their respective wives, who&#xD;
had recently immigrated to this country, and gone to&#xD;
live with Tim Limpkins. This, it seems, had given Pat&#xD;
offence, since, as he alleged, the mother had taken all&#xD;
her property to Tim's; whereas, he contended, it ought&#xD;
to have been divided equally between the two daugh-&#xD;
ters. Many angry and insulting messages had passed&#xD;
between them ; and, a few days before, they met in the&#xD;
street, and would have come to blows, but were sepa-&#xD;
rated by mutual friends.&#xD;

32     TIE BLEMMERTONS; oR,&#xD;
&#xD;
On the night mentioned, and a few moments after&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood entered, Tim Limpkins, in a drunken&#xD;
frolic, backed by two or three "ready boys," caine&#xD;
round to Pat's, and attacked him in his " Bar-room."&#xD;
A terrible fight ensued, in which nearly all took part.&#xD;
Chairs, empty bottles, barrels, pokers, every available&#xD;
article, flew about the room, making havoc of heads,&#xD;
arms, legs, eyes, noses. In vain did one of the better&#xD;
disposed shout aloud: "Pace, men! pace, men ! the&#xD;
sick crather! the sick crather! the dying crather will&#xD;
be kilt! . Be asey, be asey, the ministher ist in the&#xD;
room. Bad luck to ye, bad luck to ye." The blows&#xD;
were dealt the faster, thicker, and harder; skulls rat-&#xD;
tled, decanters .were smashed, windows flew. Pat, at&#xD;
last, seizing an empty beer bottle, struck his antagonist&#xD;
a terrible blow on the head, which felled him, and&#xD;
ended the fight.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood rushed into the room ; and oh, horrors!&#xD;
what a sight! The room presented the spectacle of a&#xD;
perfect wreck. Here lay a fellow groaning with a&#xD;
broken arm ; there, another with both eyes knocked&#xD;
out; another bitterly cried: "Och, my head ist split,&#xD;
my head ist sphlit ; wide open, wide open. 0, Biddy,&#xD;
my darlent, where ist ye ? where ist ye ?"&#xD;
The unlucky Tim lay entirely insensible, apparently&#xD;
dead, the blood streaming from his temple. By this&#xD;
time, Tim's wife and mother-in-law had got wind of the&#xD;
row; and the wives of several others of the wounded,&#xD;
who all rushed into the room, and set up the most awful&#xD;
wail that ever greeted the ear of mortal.&#xD;
" O, my Tim, and ist ye gone !" piteously exclaimed&#xD;
the wife; "gone, gone, my Tim. Yis, yis, my Tim ist.&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.            97&#xD;
Ah! my Tim, he was a good boy ; yis, he was my Tim.&#xD;
Oh, ye crathur, ye baste, ye vile varmint of desthruction.&#xD;
Yis, ye did it. Ye know'd the man was dhrunk; and&#xD;
ye ha' kilt him. Och, ye baste of a murdhurur. Ans&#xD;
if I wa' a man. But oh, mine Tim, mine Tim! Yis,&#xD;
there's a God above; yis, yis, oh, my Tim, my Tim!"&#xD;
All this time, Mr. Lovegood stood by, feeling the&#xD;
pulse of the wounded man.    The pulsations were&#xD;
feeble; but he was not dead, life had not fled. He&#xD;
sent for a physician ; meantime, bathing the wounded&#xD;
man in cold water, spirits of ether, and camphor, stop.-&#xD;
ped the flow of blood; and, in two hours, Tim had so&#xD;
far recovered, that he could be removed in a cart to his&#xD;
own home.&#xD;
" Och, and may the Holy Mither bliss ye !" said&#xD;
Biddy, as Mr. Lovegood took his departure. "Hiretic,&#xD;
or not, as Father Donneghan sis ye be, ye be the blissed&#xD;
of the Lord ! Mony's the time Biddy'll think on ye, for&#xD;
the likes o' ye ist not seen ivery day. No, no; that's a&#xD;
thruth !"&#xD;
Horrible as was this episode in a clergyman's life, who&#xD;
would not have preferred it to the authorship of the&#xD;
vile and abominable slanders that had grown out of it?&#xD;
Weeks rolled round; the sick woman grew daily&#xD;
worse ; but Mr. Lovegood was faithfully found at her&#xD;
bedside. And if John Fussy and "Jane "had watched&#xD;
him a little more narrowly, they would have seen on&#xD;
his arm, tr on the arm of Mr. or Mrs. Friendly, one of&#xD;
whom often accompanied him every day or night that&#xD;
he visited the groggery, a little basket, with a clean&#xD;
white napkin drawn over it, filled with knick-knacks&#xD;
and little comforts for the sick woman.&#xD;

And when the humble, but solemn funeral train was&#xD;
seen slowly wending down the alley, following the man&#xD;
of God in his snow-white surplice, charity whispered,&#xD;
even to "Jane's" heart, that, may be, after all, Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood had been to see the sick woman.&#xD;
Mrs. Fussy, as she gazed at the funeral train, bearing&#xD;
to their last resting-place the remains of her sister in the&#xD;
Church of God, whom she had never known nor com-&#xD;
forted, hung her head, for she felt conscience-stricken.&#xD;
The voice within cried against her, and held the lash.&#xD;
Let us trust, that she retired from the back porch a&#xD;
better woman. God only knows; with Him are the&#xD;
secrets of all hearts.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
MR. JONATHAN HEARTFUL AGAIN. A NEW STORY ON MR.&#xD;
LOVEGOOD, AND THE TERRIBLE BURSTING OF A VOLCANO.&#xD;
JONATHAN HIEARTFUL has returned from Congress,&#xD;
having distinguished himself, and won golden honors,&#xD;
in combating with the intellectual giants of his day.&#xD;
And he has now quietly settled down again in the pur-&#xD;
suit of his profession, and takes an active part in the&#xD;
affairs of the Church.&#xD;
He has visited the Blemmertons three or four times;&#xD;
and it is reported, no one knows how, and no one cares,&#xD;
that he is about to address Miss Julia Jasper. And we&#xD;
will say for Miss Julia, that, in proper hands, she would&#xD;
have made an excellent wife. Her character, truly, was&#xD;
very defective, from the effects of the false training&#xD;
through which she had passed; but there was in it&#xD;
much of latent good, that needed only a helping hand&#xD;
for its development. She was naturally of a frank&#xD;
and open disposition, warped, indeed, by a supercilious&#xD;
and selfish spirit; but, she had few concealments, and&#xD;
appeared for little more than she was really worth.&#xD;
Therefore, her's would have been a hopeful case, could&#xD;
she have been placed beyond the reach of the influences&#xD;
which had ever been thrown around her at home. She&#xD;
had been reared in a school of unreality, surrounded&#xD;
with mists, through which she gazed at the real world,&#xD;
catching but faint glimpses of it, as the mariner nearing&#xD;

330      TIlE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
the coast pierces with his keen eye through the thick&#xD;
fog, and gains an occasional glimpse of land.&#xD;
For aught that we know, Mr. Ileartful had discrimi-&#xD;
nation enough to form a correct estimate of Miss Julia's&#xD;
character; and, perhaps, had she been free from such&#xD;
powerful coadjutors as her mother, Miss Deliah Air-&#xD;
myth, Mrs. Fussy, and a few others, the report at some&#xD;
time or another might have been verified. But, as the&#xD;
case stood, it was hopeless. Agnes's time had nearly&#xD;
expired at Mrs. Densmore's, and Mr. Lovegood had&#xD;
been twice to see her within the last six months. This&#xD;
gives occasion to no small amount of impatience, and&#xD;
numberless surmises. Mrs. Nochurch and the Blem-&#xD;
mertons are found frequently together, speculating on&#xD;
the phenomenon.   They are baffled. What - can it&#xD;
mean? Can Mr. Lovegood think of marrying Agnes&#xD;
himself? It must be so. This is all the ladies can&#xD;
make of it ; and yet how preposterous! A man of&#xD;
forty, and he a clergyman, to think of marrying a girl&#xD;
not quite eighteen ! And she even dependent upon&#xD;
him for her education ! Yea, more, a barefooted beg-&#xD;
gar urchin, who, four years ago, had been prowling&#xD;
about the streets, ragged, dirty, bareheaded, picking up&#xD;
old rags, and begging pennies ! o ! the thing was un-&#xD;
bearable ! Really, if it came to pass, they would give&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood up, and go te Dr. Riproarer's Church.&#xD;
The rumor of the marriage of Mr. Lovegood and&#xD;
Deliah Airmyth had for some time partially died away ;&#xD;
nor had the groggery story been heard of, since the&#xD;
funeral of Mrs. O'Ryman. That seemed to give each&#xD;
a quietus.&#xD;
Mr. Benjamin Slocum Sapientium is yet a Presbyte-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.            331&#xD;
rian, in no way changed from what he always was.&#xD;
His rapid, triumphant, and remarkable conversion has&#xD;
effected nothing, except to give him a little more brass.&#xD;
When Mr. Lovegood accosted him, after uniting with&#xD;
the Presbyterians, he told him, that Dr. Skyrocket's&#xD;
book had converted him; and, inasmuch as it was&#xD;
placed in his hands by Dr. Riproarer, he felt in honor&#xD;
bound to join the Presbyterians. Mr. Lovegood thought&#xD;
Ben's principles of honor, after all that had occurred,&#xD;
rather shallow, not worth discussing; so, he permitted&#xD;
him to pass, with the simple remark, that he hoped he&#xD;
was a sincere penitent, and, while repenting, would not&#xD;
forget his tergiversating, and the awful sin of schism he&#xD;
had committed, in tearing himself away from the body&#xD;
of Christ.&#xD;
Upon the whole, matters stood in a passable state of&#xD;
equilibrium with all the parties whom we have intro-&#xD;
duced to the reader. Aunt Sally Milk-and-water, who&#xD;
of late had grown somewhat more relentful and charit-&#xD;
able towards the good Rector, thought it well that it&#xD;
was so; for she said they had handled Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
pretty roughly. He had been to see her the day be-&#xD;
fore, and seemed to know nothing of the stories that had&#xD;
been reported about him. Only he told her he had re-&#xD;
ceived a "hinonymous" letter about going to the the-&#xD;
atre. She did not know what a "hinonymous" letter&#xD;
was, but she was sure it was something dreadful.&#xD;
"And, la me ! what do you think he said? That he&#xD;
was never in a theatre in his life ; and laughed out-&#xD;
right. I reckon it's more than many of us can say.&#xD;
And, what's more, I went right to Pat O'iRyman's my-&#xD;
self; and asked him if Mr. Lovegood rak any thing&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7334-00000167"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
at his house; and what do you think he said? 'Och,&#xD;
bliss his riverince's heart, he dthrunk not so much as a&#xD;
glass o' cowld wather ; an' if third's any sich sthories out,&#xD;
it's Pat O'Ryman's the man as what'll say it's a lie ;&#xD;
an' he's the boy what knows it's all sprung from a&#xD;
'oman, who, as Father Donnaghan sis, hasn't followed&#xD;
the tixt about kaping at home!'"&#xD;
Although a partial quiet reigned over affairs in  ,&#xD;
there were the smouldering remains of these old stories&#xD;
and gossipings, which were occasionally fanned by some&#xD;
of the party, to keep them alive. And as in a fire long&#xD;
pent up, there often is needed but a gentle breeze to&#xD;
cause it to burst out with fury, carrying destruction be-&#xD;
fore it; so, in these elements of confusioni, jealousy,&#xD;
evil-speaking, and evil-surmising, there was needed but&#xD;
a breath, a whisper, to cause them to rage with renewed&#xD;
power of destruction.&#xD;
When Mrs. Blemmerton had made the sage discov-&#xD;
ery, that Mr. Lovegood visited Mrs. Densmore's school&#xD;
for the purpose of addressing his "daughter," (as he&#xD;
called her; but his " dependent," as the Blemmertons&#xD;
termed her,) she was fairly at her wit's end, and cast&#xD;
about for new resources. The case had a desperate&#xD;
look. Something must be done, to bring matters to a&#xD;
crisis. Mr. Lovegood had continued his pastoral visits&#xD;
to the Elemmertons, with the hope of benefiting them&#xD;
spiritually, and because it was his duty. These visits&#xD;
were, of course, the occasion of keeping alive the im-&#xD;
pression with some, that the old story was true. It was,&#xD;
therefore, no difficult matter, to cause it to become&#xD;
again the prominent topic of conversation.&#xD;
Mr. Slopill had, for a long time, been very uneasy&#xD;
&#xD;
about these reports; for he brooked not the thought of&#xD;
losing the prospective dollars and cents. lie had fre-&#xD;
quently upbraided Miss Dele, with giving Mr. Love-&#xD;
good more attention than was his due, all things con-&#xD;
sidered. About this time, meeting her one evening at&#xD;
Mrs. Nochurch's, he took upon him to broach the sore&#xD;
subject again. Miss Dele gave him to understand, that,&#xD;
for aught she knew, Mr. Lovegood had serious inten-&#xD;
tions towards her.&#xD;
Now, heretofore, Miss Dele had always strenuously&#xD;
denied all these reports to Mr. Slopill. Alas! what&#xD;
now remained to him! He now taxed her with encour-&#xD;
aging Mr. Lovegood, with the presentation of the ser-&#xD;
mon-holder, the rosebud, and the piece of poetry; all&#xD;
of which he had picked up from the current gossip.&#xD;
Not a word of all did she deny ; but she rather inti-&#xD;
mated that she was a free woman, and that, if Mr. Love-&#xD;
good addressed her, she should claim the prerogative of&#xD;
doing as she pleased. Think of this, ye sympathetic&#xD;
ones, and weep with Mr. Slopill. And had it come to&#xD;
that? She would give him no satisfaction. Mr. Slo-&#xD;
pill walked home faster that evening than he ever&#xD;
walked before, except on the memorable occasion here-&#xD;
tofore related.&#xD;
Boiling over with rage, the next morning he hurried&#xD;
to Mr. Lovegood's study. On the way, he met Mrs.&#xD;
Fussy,.with whom he paused a moment for a little chat ;&#xD;
suppressing, -as much as possible, the fiery indignation&#xD;
which burned in his bosom towards the good pastor.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Slopill."   " Good morning,&#xD;
Madam. Hope I see you well, Madam ?" " Quite&#xD;
well, Sir; but not so comfortable. Think they haven't&#xD;

is that, Madam ?" "Why, that he's going to marry&#xD;
that girl, Agnes Wallace, that he took up off the street,&#xD;
and sent to Mrs. Densmore's school." "I wish him&#xD;
good luck, Madam," said Mr. Slopill, whose counte-&#xD;
nance brightened up. -" Ah, yes, Mr. Slopill ; but for&#xD;
a olergyman to have two strings to his bow, is to me&#xD;
perfectly amazing !" By this time Mr. Slopill could&#xD;
scarcely stand on his feet. That struck a tender spring.&#xD;
"Good morning, Madam. I'm in a hurry."&#xD;
And on he went, to the Rector's study. Mr. Love-&#xD;
good was at his desk, writing a sermon for the next&#xD;
Sunday, on the parable of Dives and Lazarus. Mr.&#xD;
Slopill was dreadfully agitated ; the pastor perfectly&#xD;
calm and collected; not one care, sorrow, nor anxiety&#xD;
ruffled his benign countenance. "I am very happy to&#xD;
see you, Mr. Slopill. This is, I believe, the first time&#xD;
you have done me the honor to call." "And it's the&#xD;
last," replied Mr. Slopill, very snappishly. " 0, I hope&#xD;
not, Sir," said Mr. Lovegood, in a good-humored tone.&#xD;
" hope nothing of an unpleasant nature has occurred ."&#xD;
"There has, Sir," exclaimed Mr. Slopill, raising his&#xD;
voice several notes higher. "I have to accuse you, Sir,&#xD;
of endeavoring to supplant me in the affections of Miss&#xD;
Deliah Airmyth Blemmerton !"   "Never, Sir!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Mr. Lovegood, dropping his pen, and, for the&#xD;
first time, gaining as it were a glimpse of the position in&#xD;
which affairs stood. "Never, Sir. Such a thought, or&#xD;
wish, has never crossed my breast; nor is there the&#xD;
slightest foundation for such a surmise."&#xD;
Mr. Slopill was amazed. He stood as dumb and&#xD;
mute as a statue, before the serene countenance that&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY T HE WAYSIDE.          335&#xD;
beamed upon him. "And have you, Sir, not addressed&#xD;
Miss Blemmerton ?"  "I have answered you, Sir."&#xD;
" have you not given her to understand that you would&#xD;
do so ?"  " I have answered you, Sir."  " Did not Miss&#xD;
Blemmerton present you with a sermon-holder, Sir ?"&#xD;
"I have answered you, Sir."&#xD;
"Are you not aware that this story has been in cir-&#xD;
culation a long time? And what if the young lady&#xD;
in question confirm it, Sir ?" " That, Sir, she will&#xD;
scarcely be able to do; for, not so much as a word has&#xD;
ever passed between us on such a subject. As to the&#xD;
gossip that may have floated about with regard to my-&#xD;
self, I consider it too insignificant to be worthy of&#xD;
notice. But, you will please bear in mind, Mr. Slopill,&#xD;
that I have answered you once for all. This whole&#xD;
affair is to me a profound enigma; nor shall I submit&#xD;
to any more categorical exercises about what passes be-&#xD;
tween me and my parishioners. It is a humiliation, to&#xD;
which I do not feel called upon to condescend. And,&#xD;
Sir, had I been disposed to address Miss Blemmerton,&#xD;
I should have had no conception of your standing in&#xD;
the way; for I heard her declare, in open company,&#xD;
that no betrothment existed between you. So, under&#xD;
any circumstances, your charges would signally have&#xD;
failed. I have nothing more to do with the question,&#xD;
Sir."&#xD;
Worse and worse. Poor Mr. Slopill ! Here was a&#xD;
disclosure, for which he was totally unprepared. He&#xD;
was maddened. The whole truth flashed upon him like&#xD;
an electric spark.&#xD;
Whereunto would the pathway on which he had en-&#xD;
tered lead him? Would it conduct to the delectable&#xD;

a tart note to Miss Deliah Airmyth, about which we&#xD;
shall hear more hereafter. For the present, we invoke&#xD;

AFTER Mr. Slopill left Mr. Lovegood, the Rector con-&#xD;
tinned and brought to a conclusion his sermon on Dives&#xD;
and Lazarus, and on the following Sunday morning he&#xD;
preached it. We give merely a brief extract from it&#xD;
for the reader's benefit.&#xD;
"This rich man," said he, "was clothed in purple&#xD;
and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day. Was&#xD;
he unlike the common run of worldly rich men; rich&#xD;
men who take the world for their portion., and in it&#xD;
alone find theig reward?  Cast your eyes over this&#xD;
great city; stand mute before the gorgeous' splendor of&#xD;
its magnificence and wealth. Behold its prodigality&#xD;
and luxuriousness, and the thousands lavished by the&#xD;
hand of wealth upon the lusts of a pampered body,&#xD;
soon to rot in the tomb. Behold the thousands of poor,&#xD;
struggling on, scarcely breathing, crying aloud for the&#xD;
charities of life, spurned from the doors of the rich;&#xD;
aye, look upon the thousands of Diveses and Lazaruses&#xD;
all over this voluptuous city; and methinks you will&#xD;
have no occasion to conclude, that this rich man's case&#xD;
15&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;

338&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
is. so unlike the ways of the world and the age in which&#xD;
we live.&#xD;
'I s, alas! is a character familiar to us. That he&#xD;
was rich, may not be charged as an offence, unless his&#xD;
riches were acquired fraudulently or dishonestly. That&#xD;
he was clothed in purple and fine linen, was perchance&#xD;
only in keeping with his station in life. All men are&#xD;
equal in God's sight; souls are measured by the Eter-&#xD;
nal; and yet, for the well-being of society, as a means&#xD;
of probation, and the government of mankind and the&#xD;
stability of governments, families, and communities,&#xD;
Providence has allotted various stations and relative&#xD;
positions among men, as of the governor and the gov-&#xD;
erned, the parent and the child, the possessor of wealth&#xD;
and the diligent laborer: all, in some way, dependent&#xD;
upon each other; each laboring in his place and sphere&#xD;
for the good of the whole ; and each accountable for-&#xD;
the faithful discharge of his stewardship. We see not,&#xD;
therefore, that this rich man sinned, by clothing him-&#xD;
self in keeping with his position in life.&#xD;
" Doubtless, we gather from the whole, he was a vo-&#xD;
luptuary; in that his sin. consisted. And he.is a type&#xD;
of numbers in almost every Christian community. He&#xD;
is not represented as one given to fraud or rapine ; he&#xD;
was not a homicide, nor guilty of any heinous crime as&#xD;
a violator of the decalogue. At least, he is not charged&#xD;
with it. Banish, then, from your minds the thought,&#xD;
that there was something peculiarly black in this man's&#xD;
character, differing from and altogether above the or-&#xD;
dinary course of worldliness. Nay, he may have been&#xD;
quite a good man as the world counts goodness. Upon&#xD;
the whole, he may have been a clever citizen, 'a good&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.             339&#xD;
fellow,' as the world says. 'He harmed nobody.' And&#xD;
he -may have been liked, if not for his social qualities,&#xD;
at least for his sumptuous entertainments, and the&#xD;
favors that now and then fell from his hands upon the&#xD;
few who paid him court.&#xD;
"'Just as we see it now, such and such are called&#xD;
clever men; they entertain luxuriously; live in fine&#xD;
style ; are not niggardly in the world's service ; are&#xD;
honest, and, upon the whole, so far as the world sees,&#xD;
are moral; therefore, they are accounted good citizens,&#xD;
and are lamented when they die. But, turn to the ac-&#xD;
count of the world to come; turn to the page that re-&#xD;
veals the future; and all is a blank: there is no record&#xD;
there revealing the cross; none disclosing the words of&#xD;
love and deeds of mercy that made angels shout; char-&#xD;
ity wept not over their memory when they were gone,&#xD;
nor strewed she flowers over their grave.*&#xD;
"Now, just such a man, we contend, may have been&#xD;
this Dives; a jolly companion, a high liver, fond of&#xD;
society, dwelling in splendor, a giver of handsome en-&#xD;
tertainments, lavishing his money freely on his lusts&#xD;
and pleasures, liked by his friends, admired for his dis-&#xD;
play in the world. And notwithstanding this is the&#xD;
ugliest picture the parable will permit us to draw of&#xD;
him; when he dies, we find him in that place where&#xD;
the worm dieth not. Aye, he had frittered away his&#xD;
life in vanities: while he could clothe his own body&#xD;
splendidly, and pamper his appetite, he had no bowels&#xD;
of compassion, no eye to see suffering humanity. A&#xD;
starving mendicant could lie at his gate ; and his&#xD;
a "strew flowers o'er my grave." TACITUs.&#xD;

cry for a morsel of bread be heard with indiffer-&#xD;
ence.&#xD;
"I Methinks, and I tremble to utter the thought, be-&#xD;
cause of its awful truthfulness, that the self-indulgences&#xD;
of mankind in fashionable life, and what they are&#xD;
pleased to term their innocent allowances in pleasure&#xD;
and luxurious living, that minister to pure worldliness,&#xD;
and turn their hearts from the wants of the great human&#xD;
family, and lock them in the embraces of coldness, un-&#xD;
kindness, pomp, and uncharitableness, will people the&#xD;
abode of Dives with inmates, and fill it with eternal&#xD;
laments.&#xD;
" Before us, we have the case of a man living simply&#xD;
for SELF. His riches became a burning curse ; because,&#xD;
while he was rich unto himself, he was poor unto God&#xD;
and humanity. He was a man of the world, and took&#xD;
the world for his portion; and in that he received his&#xD;
reward.&#xD;
"IHow does he differ from all those who live by the&#xD;
same rule, and seek the same reward? How does he&#xD;
differ from all those who 'seek their own, and not the&#xD;
things that are Jesus Christ's?'&#xD;
"But this rich man died! yea, he died! His wealth&#xD;
could not purchase for himii a release from the common&#xD;
lot of man. Nay, he must die; the purple must yield&#xD;
to the shroud, and that pampered body be food for&#xD;
worms ! And now, in the other world, lie enters on&#xD;
the reward that he sought throughout his life. Sin is&#xD;
permitted to go on ; and, arousing from his pleasing&#xD;
dream of earth, he must reap the harvest that he must&#xD;
garner forever. We behold his body consigned to the&#xD;
tomb, surrounded with the trappings of wealth ; his soul&#xD;
&#xD;
has winged its way to that society which it has been&#xD;
trained to enjoy. Let us draw a curtain over the rest."&#xD;
The aforesaid sermon was the occasion of bringing'&#xD;
matters to a crisis, in some quarters. It was supposed&#xD;
to bear down heavily in more directions than one ; at&#xD;
all events, it was appropriated here and there person-&#xD;
ally, if we are to judge by the confusion displayed du-&#xD;
ring its delivery. First, Mrs. Nochurch arose, and,&#xD;
slamming her pew door lustily after her, hurried out of&#xD;
church; in a few moments, she was followed by Mrs.&#xD;
Fussy and Mrs. Fastidious, each of whom manifested no&#xD;
small amount of indignation as they passed out of the&#xD;
house of God.&#xD;
The Elemmertons had the good or ill luck,-we leave&#xD;
the reader to judge which,-to be absent. They had&#xD;
gone into mourning for the cousin of Ben Slocum, the&#xD;
tall saint, whom Mr. Simon Cobblecanting canonized.&#xD;
And as it was unfashionable, at that day, for those who&#xD;
were enjoying "the luxury of woe" to go to church,&#xD;
while the first fit of it, the "grand deuil," was on hand,&#xD;
their pew was empty. And of course, not being pres-&#xD;
ent, they did not take any part of the sermon to them-&#xD;
selves; on the principle, that on such subjects absent&#xD;
company is always excepted,-(when the period of the&#xD;
"petit deuil" arrived, they appeared again in church.)&#xD;
Indeed, Mrs. Blemmerton and Miss Deliah Airmyth&#xD;
would hardly have been able, from fatigue theclay be-&#xD;
fore, to attend church on this occasion, had not the other&#xD;
consideration prohibited; for they had quite worn them-&#xD;
selves out, before the counters of the mourning depart-&#xD;
ments of many of the large and fashionable stores; in&#xD;
which (to them) laudable work, if they did not commit&#xD;

&#xD;
numberless sins themselves, they left numberless clerks&#xD;
sinners, who most likely were ashamed to show their&#xD;
faces in church on the Lord's day.&#xD;
Shortly after the dismissal of the congregation, it be-&#xD;
gan to rain in torrents, and continued all the afternoon&#xD;
and night, to such a degree as to require the omission of&#xD;
the second service. A great many were wicked enough&#xD;
to say, that it rained floods of joy, that St.  's was&#xD;
free at last of some of its incumbrances and busybodies.&#xD;
We commend not the saying, but record it merely as in&#xD;
duty bound; nor as a faithful chronicler can we with-&#xD;
hold the remark, that numbers of the congregation re-&#xD;
joiced.&#xD;
It was unmistakably so; the ladies had deserted the&#xD;
church, never again to unite in its saintly worship, its&#xD;
scriptural and primitive Liturgy,-the Church of their&#xD;
baptism, which is linked with all the past of the Church&#xD;
of God throughout all ages. They had never fully&#xD;
realized what it was, to have the Kingdom of God come&#xD;
upon them ; what it was, all their life to have lived un-&#xD;
der that divine polity, which, through ages, has come&#xD;
down to us in one unbroken line; what it was, to have&#xD;
dwelt within the folds of the one Catholic and Apos-&#xD;
tolic Church, surrounded with all the trophies of the&#xD;
Gospel, and the glories of that world of light in which&#xD;
dwell Prophets, Priests, Kings, Apostles, Martyrs, and&#xD;
Confessors, Cherubim and Seraphim, a mighty host, " a&#xD;
cloud of witnesses" surrounding us, and holding fellow-&#xD;
ship with us; what it was, to have been akin to God-&#xD;
Man, in that sweet bond of union, by which the past&#xD;
and the future of Christ's Mystical Body are brought,&#xD;
as it were, into the present, in one grand central point&#xD;

of love ; love flowing out from Christ, and gathering&#xD;
into one fellowship angels and saints forever !&#xD;
And they are gone! The tears of sorrow follow&#xD;
them, as they must, whenever the relentless hand of&#xD;
Schism tears the seamless robe of Christ. They soon&#xD;
swelled the list of reprisals for Dr. Riproarer; the jol-&#xD;
lification is renewed on earth, while the Angels veil&#xD;
their faces and weep.* Drop your tears upon the earth,&#xD;
ye " white-winged" messengers of love; they will wash&#xD;
out none of its guilt; only the tears and blood of Im-&#xD;
manuel will do that: but they may glitter about our&#xD;
pathway, and warn us of danger.&#xD;
In theological tendencies, in the great school of In-&#xD;
differentism, we doubt not that these ladies found more&#xD;
sympathy in their new connection; and here we leave&#xD;
them  with the remark, that Mr. Fussy and Mr. Fastid-&#xD;
ions followed their wives, who, in their estimation, were&#xD;
perfect exemplars of every excellence.&#xD;
Not so, however, with Mr. Nochurch. His, wife pos-&#xD;
sessed not sufficient influence over him to mouldi hn to&#xD;
her liking. He had a real attachment to the Church,&#xD;
,although, to all intents and purposes, a worldly man;&#xD;
and, though not standing on high ground, even theoret-&#xD;
ically as a thoroughly trained Churchman, he aimed to&#xD;
be consistent, and protested to his wife, that lie discov-&#xD;
ered nothing in Mr. Lovegood's sermon calculated to&#xD;
raise afwrore; nothing that he deemed justly offensive ;&#xD;
nothing that did not naturally flow out of the subject, or&#xD;
that was not strictly true and highly appropriate; and&#xD;
* The sin of Schism, so sharply rebuked by the Apostle, is painfully&#xD;
disregarded by many.&#xD;

&#xD;
he was ready to venture the assertion, that Mr. Love-&#xD;
good had no human being in particular in his mind,&#xD;
when he preached that sermon.   Moreover, Mr. No-&#xD;
church had been a member of the choir for a number&#xD;
of years ; he had a fine bass voice, and delighted in&#xD;
church music ; and this, if no higher consideration&#xD;
could have moved him, would have kept him   at his&#xD;
post. His wife gave up, in despair. Every Sunday&#xD;
found her at Dr. Riproarer's meeting-house, and her his-&#xD;
band at his post in St. -'s church.&#xD;
And here we must briefly review Mr. Nochurch's&#xD;
early history. His parents were Presbyterians. They&#xD;
had reared six sons, and of course it was their highest&#xD;
ambition to train them in their own faith. They trusted,&#xD;
too, to see one of them a minister of their persuasion ;&#xD;
accordingly, as they severally arrived at the proper&#xD;
age, they were sent (i. e. the five elder) to a strict&#xD;
Presbyterian College. But, by some strange, unac-&#xD;
countable Providence to them, they one by one caine&#xD;
home from the Calvinistic School, thorough Church-&#xD;
men ; and he on whom they had set their hearts as. a&#xD;
Minister, took, indeed, that holy function, but preferred&#xD;
the reality, which in due time he received in the Episco-&#xD;
pal laying on of hands, and commission to preach the&#xD;
glad tidings of salvation, and administer the Sacraments.&#xD;
Our Mr. Nochurch was the youngest of the six ; and&#xD;
when the time arrived for him to leave the paternal&#xD;
roof, for the completion of his education, the following&#xD;
conversation passed between the parents&#xD;
"It is time, Mr. Nochurch," said the mother, " for&#xD;
William to be sent to college. He is now fifteen, the&#xD;
age at which his brothers were sent. And y a know I&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING B Y THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
345&#xD;
&#xD;
am not in favor of postponing so important a matter.&#xD;
What do you say? Shall he be got ready ?"   "I sup-&#xD;
pose so, my dear," said the father. "But my sons&#xD;
have all thus far deserted my Church" and faith. It&#xD;
appears to be a hard case; but I know they all are&#xD;
thoroughly honest; this is the only consolation I have.&#xD;
They have become Episcopalians,.on principle ; but, in&#xD;
so doing, they condemned their parents. It is hard to&#xD;
be borne ; but I suppose it must be so. And yet, when&#xD;
I reflect on it, I almost tremble to send William away,&#xD;
lest he should be biased too."&#xD;
"Well," said the mother, "it is indeed a hard case.&#xD;
But I have thought of a plan. We have sent all oum&#xD;
sons to a Presbyterian College; and, in spite of every&#xD;
effort, they have turned out Episcopalians. Suppose&#xD;
now we reverse it, and send William to an Episcopal&#xD;
College; it may be that he will come out a Presbyte-&#xD;
rian." The husband smiled, and yet he could not sup-&#xD;
press a sigh. "Be it as you say, my dear. But I fear&#xD;
the prospect is slender."&#xD;
Master William Nochurch was accordingly sent to a&#xD;
Church College, and came out perhaps a little nearer&#xD;
Presbyterianism than some of his brothers, but not&#xD;
quite the genuine thing.* He learned to love, if not to&#xD;
understand the Church; and this was sufficient to save&#xD;
him from the influence of his wife, and the little party&#xD;
vith whom she was identified. So true is it, that good&#xD;
geed, sown even with a sparing hand, will take root,&#xD;
spring up, and bear fruit.&#xD;
; We write from life; the like has occurred. We do not suppose&#xD;
that Presbyterian Colleges are good nurseries for the Church.&#xD;

THE BLEMMERToNS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
The affair of the Missionary, too, had had a marked&#xD;
influence upon Mr. Nochurch. From the day that he&#xD;
had followed up the Missionary, and given him twenty.&#xD;
five dollars, he felt as though somehow it had begun a&#xD;
new era in his life. lie felt as though he would like to&#xD;
be a better man. It was but the feeble whisperings of&#xD;
conscience, or as an angel's voice speaking in his heart,&#xD;
"This is the way, walk ye in it ;" for so it is, that a&#xD;
good deed does reflect itself back inwardly upon our&#xD;
spiritual being.&#xD;
We are far from supposing, that good actions neces-&#xD;
sarily make him good who pcrformis them; but we&#xD;
know, that they set the soul to thinking, and often con-&#xD;
vince the man that he is capable of doing good. And&#xD;
one good deed leads to another ; goodness begets good-&#xD;
ness, just as evil begets evil.&#xD;
" To set the outward actions right, though with an&#xD;
honest intention, and not so to regard the inward disor-&#xD;
ders of the heart, from which certain actions flow, is&#xD;
but to be putting the index of a clock right, while the&#xD;
clock itself is out of order. "&#xD;
We have asserted nothing in opposition to this apho-&#xD;
risn, nor shall we do so ; still, we insist upon it, that&#xD;
even when the inside of the clock is all right, you can-&#xD;
not have correct time without putting the index right.&#xD;
And here, for the present, we must leave Mr. No-&#xD;
church, and ask the reader to bear in mind,, that,&#xD;
according to current gossip, Mr. Lovegood had been&#xD;
twice, within the past six months, on a visit to Mrs.&#xD;
Densmore's school. This was true. But he had not&#xD;
gone for that special purpose on both occasions; he&#xD;
merely called to see Agnes, on his way to visit a brother&#xD;

clergyman, who resided some miles from her school.&#xD;
This clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Hardworker, was the&#xD;
Rector of a remote secluded country parish, in a moun-&#xD;
tainous district. Mr. Lovegood had been acquainted&#xD;
with him in his youth. Many years had intervened&#xD;
but during the past winter they met, and it was agreed&#xD;
that Mr. Lovegood should pay him a visit in the sum-&#xD;
mer.&#xD;
Accordingly, taking advantage of an opportunity&#xD;
offered by the kindness of a brother, who proffered to&#xD;
fill his place ii St.  's for a few weeks, Mr. Love-&#xD;
good, on a bright day in midsummer, took leave of&#xD;
heat, dust, bricks, and smoke, on a visit to his friend.&#xD;
He spent but one Sunday with Mr. Hardworker, and&#xD;
of course preached, his friend reading prayers. Mr.&#xD;
Iardworker was an excellent parish priest of the old&#xD;
school, rather of the "high and dry" order, but true to&#xD;
his flock, and a pattern of humble-mindedness. Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood soon discovered that his friend was a man of&#xD;
the most marked eccentricities. Being remote from&#xD;
other clergymen, and secluded from their intercourse&#xD;
and example, and the conflict of mind which serves al-&#xD;
ways to keep one posted up, and save him from the&#xD;
slavery of habits of carelessness and negligence. in the&#xD;
performance of divine service, his peculiarities and ec-&#xD;
centricities had become a second nature to him; and&#xD;
now, having arrived at that period of life which consti-&#xD;
tuted him a father in his parish, he seemed privileged&#xD;
to say and do things in his own way.&#xD;
Having gone through the service, with as few blun-&#xD;
ders as might be expected, lie announced his psalm;&#xD;
and having read it line by line, in a long nasal drawl,&#xD;

&#xD;
he slowly raised his eyes, at the same time lifting his&#xD;
glasses rather above the visual organs, a custom which&#xD;
had become stereotyped with him, and he addressed&#xD;
his congregation somewhat thus: "Brethren, if any one&#xD;
here present is a good hand at psalmody, I shall be&#xD;
obliged to him if he will raise the tune; for I have a&#xD;
cold, and am in rather a bad plight for singing."&#xD;
There is a pause, and a wonderful fluttering about the&#xD;
church, an intolerable amount of sneezing, tickling of&#xD;
throats, and coughing. All have colds to-day; the in-&#xD;
fluenza is contagious; no one starts the music.&#xD;
" Well," continued good Mr. Ilardworker, "if there&#xD;
is no one else to do it, I suppose I must." And with&#xD;
that he sounded a sort of key-note, something between&#xD;
a hiccough and a regular cough, and set out like a man&#xD;
in earnest. What the tune was, tradition does not in-&#xD;
form us; it remains yet a profound mystery. It went&#xD;
up and down, high and low, sharp and flat, a sort of&#xD;
zig-zag, see-saw,---but mostly flat,--yes, decidedly so.&#xD;
A few of the congregation joined in; each, however,&#xD;
on his or her own account, without regard to tune or&#xD;
time. And the first stanza was finished, all pretty well&#xD;
except the last line, which got down so low as to be&#xD;
past endurance.&#xD;
Meantime, in the oscillations of his body and head,&#xD;
occasioned by the effort of singing, Mr. Ilardworker's&#xD;
glasses have fallen, from their position on his forehead,&#xD;
upon the bridge of his nose, and thence have gradually&#xD;
worked their way down, until they hang on the very&#xD;
end of it, ready to fall on the floor. There is a pause&#xD;
for respiration. Mr. Ilardworker essays to raise his eyes&#xD;
from the Prayer-book. as if to speak; and away go the&#xD;
&#xD;
glasses upon the floor! " Ah !" exclaimed he, stooping&#xD;
to pick them up, "that was pretty well done !" The&#xD;
glasses, or the music ?  "But raise a leetle if you please&#xD;
on the last two words of the last line. It sounded rather&#xD;
too low, to Inc."&#xD;
What Mr. Lovegood's emotions were, we leave to the&#xD;
imaginative reader to decide. The congregation seemed&#xD;
in no way disconcerted, which, Mr. Lovegood thought,&#xD;
and so do we, argued favorably for them. Perhaps&#xD;
they were accustomed to such scenes, and therefore had&#xD;
learned to regard them as part and parcel of the natural&#xD;
order of'events.&#xD;
Nothing, however, is without profit, even to the most&#xD;
proficient, when viewed in the proper light. And we&#xD;
shall see that even this event, trivial as it was, was&#xD;
turned to account by Mr. Lovegood. At the period of&#xD;
which we write, church music, even in the city of- ,&#xD;
was not so perfectly understood and appreciated as it is&#xD;
at the present day. Chanting was then but little used,&#xD;
and note-books were rare. Reflecting on this incident,&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood came to the wise conclusion, that the&#xD;
singing in his own church needed improvement. Act-&#xD;
ing upon the hint, he returned home fully purposed to&#xD;
revolutionize his choir, and enter upon a grand series&#xD;
of improvements. And perhaps the church in-,&#xD;
and throughout the country, will never know the full&#xD;
amount of its indebtedness to Mr. lardworker, and his&#xD;
tune that was a "leetle too low, on the last two words of&#xD;
the last line!"&#xD;
The choir of St.    's was reorganized, new music&#xD;
books obtained, and sundry additional aids called into&#xD;
service.&#xD;

350     THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Nothing leads to perfection sooner than practice; in&#xD;
the art of singing, this has been verified from time im1-&#xD;
memorial. Every Friday evening, the newly-organized&#xD;
choir met in the.church, for practice and improvement.&#xD;
From this the Rector expected the most happy results;&#xD;
a spirit of inquiry was excited, the feelings of the young&#xD;
persons of the parish were enlisted, and Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
rejoiced in the prospect of accomplishing an important&#xD;
work. But as winter approached, it was suggested by&#xD;
some one, that it would be much more comfortable to&#xD;
meet at private houses for practice. Mr. Lovegood,&#xD;
though opposed to this arrangement, suffered himself&#xD;
to be overruled. Professor Singman, the leader of the&#xD;
choir, was decidedly in favor of it, and he was very&#xD;
popular with members of the choir. -le was just from&#xD;
the land of song, and full of music. Unfortunately, he&#xD;
was a Congregationalist, (but he was the best they could&#xD;
get,) and had often manifested a decided preference for&#xD;
the music in vogue amongst his sect. This predilection&#xD;
he had never been able to indulge in the Church; he&#xD;
was therefore too happy, at the prospect of getting the&#xD;
choir a little free from the control of the Rector, that&#xD;
he might occasionally exercise his penchant for some of&#xD;
his favorite tunes.&#xD;
The first of these meetings for rehearsal, was held at&#xD;
the house of Mr. Allright. Mr. Allright was a good&#xD;
Churchman, which implies that we consider him a very&#xD;
good man; but he had a large circle of Presbyterian&#xD;
and Methodist friends, and these he saw no harm in in-&#xD;
viting to his house on this occasion, to hear the music,&#xD;
and take part in the exercises of the evening.&#xD;
Mr. Allright did not think this exactly the thing;&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS B3Y TnE WAYSIDE.            351&#xD;
but what else could he do ? It was his house; and they&#xD;
were friends whom he was unwilling to offend. Take&#xD;
it all in all, it appeared to be the best thing that he could&#xD;
do. Still he was not exactly satisfied with himself, nor&#xD;
was he surprised to discover that Mr. Lovegood was not&#xD;
pleased at finding so large a company, not actual mem-&#xD;
bers of the choir. He thought it would tend to distract&#xD;
their attention, prove a hindrance, and in the end oc-&#xD;
casion evil.&#xD;
Notwithstanding, the first meeting passed off very&#xD;
pleasantly, with a single exception. All were seated&#xD;
around a long table ;. the music books, containing those&#xD;
mysterious ciphers almost as unmanageable as Greek or&#xD;
Hebrew lying open before them ; and Professor Sing-&#xD;
man standing erect at the head of the table, waving his&#xD;
hand, beating time, doing the flourishes, with eyes&#xD;
closed, waving from side to side and to and fro, as&#xD;
though a storm alternately beat upon him from the four&#xD;
great points of the compass.. It was really a rare sight.&#xD;
But, alas ! for the exception, mutatis mutandis, so the&#xD;
world goes. It's not all gold that glitters ; nor may we&#xD;
always expect to have sunshine. A church anthem was&#xD;
begun; up jumped Miss Presbyterian, a blue-stocking&#xD;
of the real grit, and, throwing back her head, with an&#xD;
uncomfortable amount (to tender nerves) of surprise&#xD;
and indignation flashing from her eyes, walked hasti-&#xD;
ly out of the room, seeming to say in her every motion,&#xD;
"I did not know I was invited here to listen to any&#xD;
thing from that Book "&#xD;
Time rolled on, and the choir meetings increased in&#xD;
numbers. The thing was decidedly popular. It took&#xD;
charmingly. It made such a capital frolic. The young&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7334-00000177"/>&#xD;
852      TEl BILE M c+RToNs o1R,&#xD;
&#xD;
gentlemen brought candies, almonds, raisins, and other&#xD;
delectables ; and the young ladies, of course, assisted in&#xD;
consuming them.&#xD;
So soon as the ladies were seated around the long ta-&#xD;
ble, the books opened, Professor Singman at his post,&#xD;
and all in readiness,-slap, slap, here and there, first a&#xD;
paper of candy, then one of almonds or raisins would&#xD;
drop upon the table. And then a merry laugh, or a&#xD;
few bright smiles. These must be discussed, kiss-verses&#xD;
and all. It was the life of singing. Candy cleared&#xD;
the throat, and tuned the organs of sound, while the&#xD;
raisins and almonds, we suppose, strengthened the lungs,&#xD;
and the pretty kiss-verses banished bashfulness and en-&#xD;
ni!&#xD;
And so the evening passed ; a sprinkle of music, a&#xD;
shower of tete-a-tete, and the raisins, almonds, and&#xD;
candy !&#xD;
Ah ! Mr. Hardworker, what have you done Are&#xD;
you not answerable for getting your brother into such a&#xD;
dilemma ?&#xD;
In spite of Mr. Lovegood, Professor Singman would,&#xD;
when he could get an opportunity, in which he was&#xD;
sorely baffled by the candy, etc., introduce a touch&#xD;
of his Congregationalist tunes,-the farther from the&#xD;
Church's anthems the better for him! Congregational&#xD;
chants were much simpler and more readily learned.&#xD;
When he got them to be masters of the chanting art,&#xD;
they could then undertake, with more ease and profi-&#xD;
ciency, the chants of the Church. They were, in short,&#xD;
to be drilled through Congregationalism.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood thought, and so do we, that the Church&#xD;
was safest in doing her own drilling. She needs no&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.   353&#xD;
&#xD;
schoolmaster in the shape of Congregationalism, nor&#xD;
any other sm, to teach her any thing. A war of words&#xD;
was the inevitable consequence. Mr. Lovegood put his&#xD;
veto, as was his bounden duty, on all the proceedings;&#xD;
and discovering that a mistake had been made, profit-&#xD;
ing by experience, he set to work to repair it, with all&#xD;
haste.&#xD;
The new choir was dissolved, and another organized.&#xD;
Professor Singman became highly offended, and de-&#xD;
clared, that he would have nothing more to do with it.&#xD;
A number of the young ladies and gentlemen dropped&#xD;
off, and united with the Professor's party. Mr. Love-&#xD;
good of course was soundly abused; it was a piece of&#xD;
priestcraft and popery ; a high-handed measure.  Mr.&#xD;
Allright, Mr. Nochurch, and all the more substantial of&#xD;
the old choir. sustained Mr. Lovegod; and he lived&#xD;
through the tornado raised by the professor.&#xD;
But enough h 'cd been done, to awaken a spirit of in-&#xD;
quiry and improvement. The new organization em-&#xD;
braced substantial men and women; Church music be-&#xD;
came the order of the day in --; the work spread&#xD;
abroad ; new note-books sprung into existence ; and the&#xD;
Church was edified.&#xD;
Let no man despise the day of small things, nor&#xD;
neglect the most trivial incident in life. Accidents&#xD;
have blessed the world with many of the grandest dis-&#xD;
coveries made by the mind of man. And, for aught&#xD;
that we know, the falling of Mr. Hardworker's specta-&#xD;
cles had something to do with the rapid growth of mu-&#xD;
sical talents and attainments in our country!&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
A PREDICAMENT. MR. SLOPILL WITH SAWDUST IN HIS&#xD;
EYES. GOSSIPING. MR. LOVEGOOD MARRIED. A TER-&#xD;
RIBLE SURPRISE. SMELLING BOTTLES, ETC.&#xD;
MR. SLOPILL, as we have related, after leaving Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood, hurried to his bacon establishment, and&#xD;
despatched a note to Miss Deliah Airmyth. Affairs&#xD;
certainly looked squally, and needed an explanation.&#xD;
Mr. Slopill was not the man to be trifled with. Miss&#xD;
Dele had plainly given him to understand, that Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood had addressed her ; and he denied it in toto.&#xD;
The pastor must be confounded, or the lady must make&#xD;
suitable explanations. It was certainly an unpleasant&#xD;
affair. On the one hand stood the lady, on the other&#xD;
the Rector; backing the whole stood the prospective&#xD;
dollars and cents. Mr. Slopill had been brought into&#xD;
direct conflict with a clergyman, had made a ridiculous&#xD;
dolt of himself, and had been obliged, for the time&#xD;
being, to retire from the field, totally discomfited.&#xD;
These evils were overpowering to a gentleman of&#xD;
delicate sensibilities ; and if Mr. lopill's whiskers&#xD;
were not duly brushed, and his head oiled and combed,&#xD;
during the hours of suspense, surely the most fastidious&#xD;
will find in their breasts a generous excuse for him.&#xD;
And was not Miss Deliah in a predicament? Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood had been charged with evil intentions,&#xD;
bearded as it were, in his own sanctum, told that he&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTTNs S11Y TIE WAYSJDR.'          355&#xD;
had played an ungentlemanly part in addressing the&#xD;
lady, and all upon her own authority. He had also&#xD;
informed Mr. Slopill, that he had Miss Delial's word&#xD;
and solemn asseveration, that no betrothment existed&#xD;
between them; of all of which she was but too con-&#xD;
scious. Was ever young lady in so sad a plight ? O&#xD;
ye knights and ladies of romance, can ye not come to&#xD;
the rescue of Miss Deliah Airmyth Blemmerton? Ye&#xD;
who have made so ,many hair-breadth escapes in the&#xD;
romance of real life, can ye not succor a poor defence-&#xD;
less, hapless, and helpless young lady, who has drawn&#xD;
about her so many nets of destruction that she cannot&#xD;
escape ? Pity, pity, ye sighing swains! Comfort&#xD;
comfort, ye acute dames, and persevering maidens, who&#xD;
understand the art of solving such difficult ques-&#xD;
tions!&#xD;
What is Miss Dele to do ?-Lose a certain prospect,&#xD;
let go a sure anchor, and float out on an uncertain tide?&#xD;
Oh, terrible dilemma! Miss IDele is now far gone out&#xD;
of her teens; prospects are growing more and more&#xD;
slender; even two hundred thousand seems to be an&#xD;
insufficient bait. Leave it to the ladies! Miss Dele&#xD;
was obliged to make an expos to her mother, humili-&#xD;
ating as it was. A counsellor she must have: " In the&#xD;
multitude of counsellors there is safety :" her mother was&#xD;
a multitude ! " Write to him at once, Dele," said she,-&#xD;
" break it all off; and leave it with me !" Miss De&#xD;
wrote a scathing, withering note to Mr. Slopill, revoking&#xD;
the engagement that had existed between them for sev-&#xD;
eral years. How far that mended the matter we under-&#xD;
take not to say; but, that night, Mr. Slopill apologized&#xD;
to Mr. iLovegood. The mists rolled away, and if Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7334-00000179"/>&#xD;
356      THlE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Slopill was not a wiser man, he deserves to be set down&#xD;
as a stupid dotard.&#xD;
When Mr. Lovegood became acquainted with all the&#xD;
facts, we can scarcely be surprised, that he thought it&#xD;
rather an unbecoming episode in the life of a candidate&#xD;
for confirmation, and highly derogatory to the character&#xD;
of a serious person.&#xD;
Troubles, it will be perceived, were fast accumulating&#xD;
on Mr. Lovegood's hands. The split between Mr. Slo-&#xD;
pill and Miss Dele served to renew the old stories; for&#xD;
Miss Dele no sooner found herself adrift on the wide&#xD;
ocean of uncertainty, than she set herself diligently to&#xD;
the task of again entrapping Mr. Slopill. In order to&#xD;
accomplish this, she had by slow degrees and insinua-&#xD;
tions to ingratiate herself into his favor. This was not&#xD;
to be accomplished, without making a scape-goat of the&#xD;
Rector. Her first work was to convince Mr. Slopill,&#xD;
by what means it little booted, that after all Mr. Love-&#xD;
good was not exactly so clear as he might have been ;&#xD;
but let it pass now ; in future she should know better&#xD;
how to act. The two hundred thousand assisted Mr.&#xD;
Slopil's faith very much, and the breach was soon&#xD;
healed. Of course, to keep Mr. Slopill alive, the old&#xD;
story must at least be insinuated.&#xD;
Mrs. Fussy, Mrs. Fastidious, and Mrs. Nochurch,&#xD;
were more active than ever ; and even the elder Blem-&#xD;
mertons were getting a little more decided in their&#xD;
stand. The. old groggery story, too, was revived, with&#xD;
fresh relish and gusto, notwithstanding the quietus that&#xD;
it had received. Added to all this, was the affair&#xD;
of Ben Slocum, and the desertion of the church by the&#xD;
aforesaid ladies; all of which, in certain quarters, was&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS EY TUE WAYSIDE.            357&#xD;
accounted a great loss to the poor church, and a lasting&#xD;
dishonor to the Rector. And worse than all, the tocsin&#xD;
rang with the alarm, that Mr. Lovegood was playing&#xD;
at the tune of "two strings to his bow." It was an&#xD;
established fact, that he had courted Dele Blemmerton;&#xD;
and it was just as certain, that he had gone. to Mrs.&#xD;
Densmore's to court Agnes Wallace. The gossipers&#xD;
knew all these. to be stubborn facts, and they were .not&#xD;
slow in relating them. And 0, wasn't Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
a bad man? 0 dear, 0 (ear, was such a man fit to&#xD;
preach the gospel; courting two ladies at one time ?&#xD;
0, fie on him, fie on him! What shall be done with&#xD;
him? Who ever heard of good Dr. Skyrocket, or Dr.&#xD;
Riproarer, doing such a thing? Ah me ! ah me ! it's&#xD;
too bad, it's mean, it's contemptible.&#xD;
Meantime, Dr. Goodenough had paid the debt of na-&#xD;
ture; and now, by the terms of agreement between&#xD;
him and the vestry, the Rectory was to be given up to&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood; who, we should have stated before, had&#xD;
boarded all the while with Mr. Friendly. Mr. Love-&#xD;
good would not consent to see the aged widow remove&#xD;
from the home which, for so many years, had been&#xD;
sanctified by her presence. Every nook and corner of&#xD;
it seemed eloquent of her name and praise. It was&#xD;
therefore agreed, that he should remove to the Rectory,&#xD;
and take up his residence there, leaving the manage-&#xD;
ment of the household to Mrs. Goodenough. This was&#xD;
deemed a judicious and excellent arrangement, by all&#xD;
the parishioners. Mrs. Goodenough, though enjoying&#xD;
excellent health, was an aged lady, but exceedingly&#xD;
active for her time of life; and it was affirmed, that&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood would make her home agreeable to her,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7334-00000180"/>&#xD;
DOTTING BY TIHE WAYSIDE.   359&#xD;
&#xD;
and cheer her declining days, as a son dearly be-&#xD;
loved.&#xD;
It was thought to happen well, on another account.&#xD;
The time for Agnes to leave Mrs. Densmore's had now&#xD;
arrived; and every thing seemed to be propitious, for&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood to bring her home, to live with himself&#xD;
and Mrs. Goodenough.&#xD;
This report was not long in finding circulation. The&#xD;
knowing ones took it up with delight. Some thought&#xD;
it a high-handed measure. The Blemmertons did not&#xD;
hesitate to say, that it would be a disgrace. Whether&#xD;
Dr. Riproarer preached a sermon on the subject, tra-&#xD;
dition does not relate.&#xD;
So it was : poor Agnes was already dragged into the&#xD;
arena of strife, and her name was bandied about with&#xD;
an unsparing hand. Happily for her, she was ignorant&#xD;
of all that was said. Happy in her conscious rectitude,&#xD;
looking forward to the day when she should join her&#xD;
dear good father, as she always called him, in his own&#xD;
home, which would be hers; and yet twining her heart&#xD;
about her fond school associations, her days glided&#xD;
away in mingled sadness and delight; delight, at the&#xD;
prospect of having a home that she could call herown,&#xD;
and the companionship, protection, and guardianship,&#xD;
of one unto whom she could look as a father; sadness,&#xD;
at the thought that she must tear herself away from&#xD;
her beloved "Mother" Densmore, and the joyous remi-&#xD;
niscences that-clustered about her school.&#xD;
And now, every evening, when the little glee-song&#xD;
is sung, Agnes is observed to steal away to her own&#xD;
room; and there, falling on her knees, she pours out&#xD;
her heart in prayer, and finds solace and comfort in&#xD;
&#xD;
the thought, that, come what might, she would every-&#xD;
where be under the protection of her Father in heaven.&#xD;
Yes, thou lone wanderer over the way of life, God is&#xD;
everywhere; and everywhere is He the Father of the&#xD;
faithful ; everywhere is He the Father of those who&#xD;
bear the impress of the Son. The earth and the heav-&#xD;
ens are but a vast temple of praise; the sun, moon, and&#xD;
stars, but glittering lamps to light it withal. And, lo!&#xD;
when the heavens and the earth shall pass away, and&#xD;
the new heavens, and the new earth shall be revealed,&#xD;
that too will be a vast temple of praise, of which the&#xD;
LAMB that was slain shall be the LIGHT and the GLORY.&#xD;
Go out on thy way of life. Trust in Christ and be&#xD;
strong. God is everywhere. But nowhere is He more&#xD;
graciously present, than in the hearts of the humble,&#xD;
and contrite, and faithful, when lifted up unto Him in&#xD;
prayer, or when, in the Holy Sanctuary, they draw&#xD;
nigh unto Him in the devout reception of the means of&#xD;
grace.&#xD;
Agnes had been confirmed at a late visitation of the&#xD;
Bishop, and was now a devout and regular communi-&#xD;
cant of the Church. She was therefore not without the&#xD;
aids and comforts of divine grace, to meet the real&#xD;
issues of life. And when she came down from her&#xD;
chamber, no one would have supposed, that scalding&#xD;
tears had chased each, other down her cheeks. A ra-&#xD;
diant smile played over her countenance, bespeaking&#xD;
the calm which reigned in her heart.&#xD;
But, at last, the day of separation came. The exam-&#xD;
ination is over ; the diplomas are given; the parting&#xD;
kiss, the long, long embrace, the tears of separation, the&#xD;
"mother's" blessing, are all that remain !&#xD;

<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7334-00000181"/>&#xD;
360     THE BLEMMEIRTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
On the appointed day, Mr. Lovegood's carriage drove&#xD;
up to the door of the Seminary; and lo, and behold!&#xD;
wonders upon wonders! there is a lady in it.&#xD;
The door of the carriage is thrown open; the lady&#xD;
steps out; and Agnes has a mother. Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
comes up smiling, laughing, and weeping. "This is&#xD;
your daughter, my dear."  "And dear Agnes,-and&#xD;
this is Agnes,-the sweet Agnes." And they both em-&#xD;
braced her, shedding tears of joy. Even Mother Dens-&#xD;
more weeps; the girls, too, sympathize in the delights&#xD;
of the moment; they sing again the glee-song, laugh-&#xD;
ing through tears. It is a day of sad partings and hap-&#xD;
py greetings. All are happy ; all are sorrowful. It is&#xD;
a day of bright sunshine ; if there be a cloud, it is&#xD;
gilded by the rosy hues of light and joy.&#xD;
It is a world of vicissitudes. And Mr. Lovegood is&#xD;
married ! And he neither addressed Agnes, nor Deliah&#xD;
Airmyth Blemmerton? Just so. The ladies for once&#xD;
were mistaken. They had no one to blame but them..&#xD;
selves. "It all came," as Aunt Sally Milk-and-water&#xD;
afterwards said, "from their being too wise and too&#xD;
anxious."&#xD;
But, as yet, the busybodies are in profound igno-&#xD;
rance. During Mr. Lovegood's absence, nothing but&#xD;
the expected arrival had been canvassed; the disgrace&#xD;
of the thing; the town talk it would create. Several&#xD;
of them, too, were all anxiety, wondering whether&#xD;
Agnes Wallace would return as Mrs. Rector; in that&#xD;
event, numerous plans were laid. "The Blemmertons&#xD;
did not intend to recognize her; the Misses Highflyer&#xD;
could not think of noticing a clergyman's wife who&#xD;
sprung from nothing." Mrs. Nochurch, Mrs. Fussy,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.            361&#xD;
and Mrs. Fastidious, who still croaked, declared they&#xD;
were glad of it; it would teach some people a grain of&#xD;
common sense ; they knew she would be very extrava-&#xD;
gant; that would be some consolation; the congregation&#xD;
would soon get clear of Mr. Lovegood, they reckoned,&#xD;
when that girl came into the Rectory as the Rector's&#xD;
wife. Even Aunt Sally shook her head ominously, and&#xD;
gave an occasional sigh, by way of chorus ; for the old&#xD;
lady began to be a little uneasy, lest she had committed&#xD;
herself too soon on the Rector's side. "Ah, well, well,&#xD;
I reckon we'll soon know the 'wust,' as my poor mo-&#xD;
ther used to say ; but the times have changed,-yes, yes,&#xD;
there's more 'larnin' now they say, that's it, I reckon."&#xD;
Meantime, at a late hour of the night, Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Lovegood and Agnes arrived at the Rectory. Even&#xD;
Mrs. Goodenough was taken by surprise; for Mr. Love-&#xD;
good had not given her so much as a hint of his inten-&#xD;
tions. But her heart was glad, when she discovered&#xD;
that her fine son, as she called him, had made so excel-&#xD;
lent a match, and her old home was to be enlivened by&#xD;
two such beings as Mrs. Lovegood and the charming&#xD;
Agnes.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the pledges of Mrs. Blemmerton,&#xD;
that if Agnes came to the Rectory she would not pay&#xD;
her any attention, yet, having heard, the next morning,&#xD;
that Mr. Lovegood and Agnes had arrived, she was too&#xD;
impatient to wait for particulars, forgot all her stormy&#xD;
resolutions, and, long before 12 o'clock, she and Miss&#xD;
Dele were attired, and waiting for their carriage to&#xD;
drive up to the Rectory and learn the worst. "It can&#xD;
hardly be so," ejaculated Mrs. B.,-" but, 'm deter-&#xD;
mined to know." " Dear me, the mornings are so long,"&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7334-00000182"/>&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE,  363&#xD;
&#xD;
taking out her watch, " but it is twelve, and there's the&#xD;
carriage ; come, Dele."  And the ladies, Miss Dde es-&#xD;
pecially, dressed in very becoming style, plain, neat,&#xD;
simple, free from flowers, rouge, or any thing of the&#xD;
kind, and looking as innocent, quiet, gentle, fascinating&#xD;
as possible, junp in, and away they drive.&#xD;
The bell rings ; they enter the parlor of the Rectory:&#xD;
it is a little dark; it is well for the ladies, else in a&#xD;
fuller light they might have exhibited signs of pallor.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood enters. "0O, Mr. Lovegood, I'm so&#xD;
glad you've returned, and all safe and sound. And&#xD;
how is Agnes? how does she look? 0, I wanted to&#xD;
see her so badly, that I could not wait another day !"&#xD;
Agnes enters the parlor, and is introduced as Miss&#xD;
Wallace. What a comfort ! And now a dark room is&#xD;
comfortable on another account. The pallor has de-&#xD;
parted, and a crimson glow blushes on the cheeks of&#xD;
the ladies. 0, how red,-how it burns,--and how the&#xD;
eyes sparkle,-Miss Dele is certainly getting handsome.&#xD;
She and the two hundred thousand would not be so bad&#xD;
a bargain, after all. "And now Miss Agnes, I suppose,&#xD;
has finished her education, and you willnot send her to&#xD;
Madame Fanciful's ?" " Agnes must determine that for&#xD;
herself; what do you say, my daughter?"  " I expect&#xD;
always to be a student," replied she, " but I do not&#xD;
desire to go to Madame Fanciful's."&#xD;
"She is a famous teacher; she makes girls so accomn-&#xD;
plished. My Dele, and Julia Jasper, never went to&#xD;
any other school. And I reckon now, Mr. Lovegood,&#xD;
you begin to feel like taking my advice; the Rectory&#xD;
will look so forlorn without-Well, you know-" " O,&#xD;
let me introduce you, Madam, to Mrs. Lovegood," said&#xD;
&#xD;
he, rising, as his wife entered the room. Now darken&#xD;
the room, bring in water, a smelling bottle, let no light&#xD;
intrude. 0 ye cynics, close your eyes! 0, ye mirth-&#xD;
full nymphs, look not upon the scene. What concern is&#xD;
it of yours, if the ladies grow pale, and struggle hard&#xD;
to suppress their chagrin and disappointment?&#xD;
"A short call,-mnany calls to make this morning!&#xD;
Dear me, it's nearly one o'clock; come, Dele,-good&#xD;
morning, ladies,-good 1 iorning, Mr. Lovegood."&#xD;
The ladies got into the carriage, scarcely seeing the&#xD;
pavement, and drove home. "Well, well, well !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Mrs. B., as she threw herself back in the&#xD;
carriage, "if that isn't cool !" Miss Dele hummed a&#xD;
tune: "I never lov'd a tree or flower."&#xD;
"The tall, gawky, ugly thing. What does she look&#xD;
like? A pretty clergyman's wife ! A charming pros-&#xD;
pect for the parish, isn't it ? Two women to support,-&#xD;
curls too,-rigged out like a young girl, full of airs and&#xD;
graces."&#xD;
Drive home, ladies, and take an effervescing draught,&#xD;
and a little ice-water. Mr. Lovegood has committed&#xD;
no crime. He has only followed your advice; -and, in&#xD;
his choice, he has acted on the principle of the "Know-&#xD;
Nothings." He is certainly old enough to choose for&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
And now you would like to know who Mrs. Love-&#xD;
good was, and to have a description of her. We know&#xD;
not, that either would be particularly edifying, but&#xD;
suppose we must gratify so reasonable a desire. She&#xD;
was the sister of the Rev. Mr. Hardworker, whom Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood met in his trip to the mountains. Let that&#xD;
suffice for one fact; for the other, Mrs. Lovegood was&#xD;

to fill her station, with honor to herself and husband,&#xD;
and good to the church. We have no taste for the ta:sk&#xD;
of describing the color of a lady's eyes or hair, or the&#xD;
length of her nose : please excuse us, on that score.&#xD;
We are not writing sentimentalism. She was neither&#xD;

Aunt Sally was fast working round on the Rector's&#xD;
side again.&#xD;
The Blemmertons continued their pew in church, and&#xD;
attended about once a month. It was a long time&#xD;
before they visited the Rectory again; upon which&#xD;
there "hangs a tale," which in due time will come out.&#xD;
Nor was Agnes invited to any of their entertainments.&#xD;
Aunt Sally said, "it was because they were ashamed&#xD;
of themselves."  But, in, this, she was, we think, mis-&#xD;
taken.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
AGNES WALLACE AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME. MR. HEART-&#xD;
FUL. A RIDE' A COURTSHIP'; AND A FAILURE.&#xD;
AGNES, for the four years that she was under Mrs.&#xD;
Densmore's tuition, had been a hard student. She had&#xD;
now arrived at that period of life, when she could fully&#xD;
appreciate Mr. Lovegood's kindness to her ; and the&#xD;
desire to manifest her gratitude to him, apart from a&#xD;
sense of her own deficiencies, and need of education, had&#xD;
acted as a powerful stimulus. Poverty and dependence,&#xD;
too, often are powerful stimulants to the young. hence,&#xD;
while the children of the wealthy, under the most pro-&#xD;
pitious circumstances, often fritter away their time at&#xD;
school or college, and return home and enter the world,&#xD;
with little else than an empty diploma, and dollars and&#xD;
cents,-with  empty heads, frivolous manners, and&#xD;
warped or corrupt principles,-the children of the poor&#xD;
depend entirely upon their education, appreciate their&#xD;
privileges, make the most of their time, and come out&#xD;
qualified with heart and head learning, prepared to take&#xD;
a high stand in whatever position Providence may al-&#xD;
lot to them.&#xD;
The free use of a large amount of spending money is&#xD;
too often seriously detrimental to the progress of the&#xD;
children of the wealthy, who are indulged in this way.&#xD;
No boy nor girl will make due progress, with a pocket&#xD;
full of money. It will be found ever to be in the way&#xD;

&#xD;
THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
of books, studies, mental exercises, and indeed of good&#xD;
manners ; making a child haughty, extravagantly fond&#xD;
of dress and independence; filling the heart with&#xD;
" Young America," and moulding the character by a re-&#xD;
gard to the potent dollar, rather than by mental and heart&#xD;
culture. Dollars and cents burn the fingers of a child.&#xD;
It should, therefore, be permitted to burn itself as&#xD;
little as possible ; and of the spending of every penny&#xD;
granted, the parent or guardian should require a strict&#xD;
account.&#xD;
Few moments found Agnes idle. Many weary nights,&#xD;
while her room-mates were wrapt in slumber, was she&#xD;
found, till a late hour, poring over her books, before the&#xD;
dimly burning lamp. And the result was now mani-&#xD;
fest. In four years, she had become a scholar of no or-&#xD;
dinary attainments. She read Latin and Greek with&#xD;
fluency ; also French and German ; was quite an adept&#xD;
in painting and drawing; played well on the harp and&#xD;
piano, and sang sweetly. Nor had she neglected those&#xD;
accomplishments whichhad domestic life more express-&#xD;
ly in view. Mrs. Densmore had aflrded her every&#xD;
opportunity of improvement in housekeeping; and&#xD;
when she became an inmate of the Rectory, the elder&#xD;
ladies soon discovered, that she understood the routine&#xD;
of domestic pursuits and duties, from the cutting out&#xD;
and making of a garment, to the baking of a pound-&#xD;
cake. And she was so good, withal, so amiable, so gen-&#xD;
tle, that she won all hearts. Highly accomplished,&#xD;
and of attractive, dignified, yet simple manners, a de.&#xD;
vout Churchwoman, ever ready for all good works,&#xD;
wherever she went she seemed to move in a charmed&#xD;
circle, the admired of all admirers. All forgot the poor,&#xD;
&#xD;
sorrow-stricken orphan girl, in the full-grown, majestic&#xD;
Christian woman, of cultivated mind, and transcendent&#xD;
personal charms.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, who loved her as a fond father loves&#xD;
his only daughter, often pressed her to his heart, and&#xD;
thanked her for having giyen him so much satisfaction.&#xD;
" The best act," he said, "'that ever I performed in my&#xD;
life." The old silver cup was placed away as a sacred&#xD;
reminiscence ; and every anniversary of Mrs. Wallace's&#xD;
death, it was produced, that the past might be revived&#xD;
in his memory.&#xD;
Agnes is becoming so universal a favorite, that fears&#xD;
are entertained at the Rectory, lest the charm of her&#xD;
society may soon be lost there.&#xD;
Of all the gentlemen who visited the Rectory, Mr.&#xD;
Ieartful always seemed the most deferential towards&#xD;
Miss Wallace. There was an unwonted reserve on his&#xD;
part, that always made Agnes melancholy, and served&#xD;
to carry her back to that eventful night, when she met&#xD;
him under the dimly burning lamp. He was then a&#xD;
young man, and she a little girl. All the past would&#xD;
gush up into her heart,-the sad death of her father and&#xD;
mother, the conduct of the Blemmertons, and her own&#xD;
altered condition in life. And 0! how she wished for&#xD;
one moment, one happy moment, just to thank him, to&#xD;
manifest her gratitude. With these thoughts she would&#xD;
seek her chamber and commune in silence with her&#xD;
God.&#xD;
A long time had passed, without the occurrence of&#xD;
any thing worth relating. Mr. ileartful had been a&#xD;
constant visitor at the Rectory; but few words had&#xD;
passed between him and Agnes, except on commonl-&#xD;

place topics. One day, he called and sent in his card,&#xD;
with the request that Miss Wallace would take a ride&#xD;
with him in the country, to enjoy the pleasant afternoon,&#xD;
and the beautiful scenery.&#xD;
They proceeded a mile or so, making an occasional&#xD;
remark on the grandeur of the hills, and the noble riv-&#xD;
er which swept on before them, or the passage of a&#xD;
beautiful bird as it flew by them in the air. But -Mr.&#xD;
lleartful was more than usually silent ; and Agnes,&#xD;
dwelling on the past, could not overcome a feeling of&#xD;
melancholy. So they passed along, each, for the most&#xD;
part, wrapped in thought and emotion. At last Mr.&#xD;
lleartful remarked, " Miss Wallace,-no, Agnes, I will&#xD;
call you, if you will permit me."  "Yes, Agnes, if you&#xD;
please, Mr. Heartful," said she, scarcely concealing the&#xD;
tear-drop that filled her eyes, as she turned away her&#xD;
head; for he had not called her Agnes, since the day&#xD;
he took leave of her, when she was about to go to Mrs.&#xD;
Densmore's.&#xD;
" Agnes, I little thought, on that memorable night,&#xD;
that I should ever enjoy the pleasure of seeing you what&#xD;
you are. But, God's ways are not as our ways. Would&#xD;
that I could tell you all that thrills my heart, when&#xD;
memory reverts to that night. Ah, we have both&#xD;
passed through sorrows and vicissitudes since then ! But,&#xD;
there are memories clustering around that old lamp-&#xD;
post, and that dilapidated old house, that I would not&#xD;
part with for all the world ! Forgive mo for touching&#xD;
upon so tender a theme. My heart is full, very full,&#xD;
and I cannot avoid it."&#xD;
" Speak on, Mr. Ileartful," said she, looking upon him&#xD;
with her full lustrous eyes, for she had no conception of&#xD;
&#xD;
the point to which his conversation would lead. " Ire-&#xD;
joice to meditate on that past. It is my frequent em-&#xD;
ployment. It brings to me many, ah, how many, remi-&#xD;
niscences of sorrow ; but, not one of shame nor false&#xD;
delicacy. My condition in life is indeed changed ; but&#xD;
I have not forgotten the past of my history, nor do my&#xD;
feelings foster a false and unworthy pride, when I con-&#xD;
trast the past with the present, especially in the pres-&#xD;
ence of my benefactor."&#xD;
" Ah, that word ! that fatal word ! Please recall it,"&#xD;
said he, manifesting more emotion than she had ever&#xD;
before observed in him.  "I would not have that&#xD;
word or thought come between me and the gleam of&#xD;
happiness which I have of late hoped, perhaps too fond-&#xD;
ly hoped, would flash across my pathway. I have kept&#xD;
that past ever before me, as a bright spot in my check-&#xD;
ered life. I have watched the little Agnes, as she came&#xD;
up to womanhood ; have nursed in my heart the fond&#xD;
hope of seeing her what she is, and what I was sure she&#xD;
would be. And now,-well,-ah, well, I want words&#xD;
to say all. But I have nursed the hope, that a greater&#xD;
blessingis in store for me, than the mere pleasurable&#xD;
memory of the past. Do not deem me selfish. That&#xD;
past would much more than reward me, for my poor&#xD;
performance of a bounden duty. Ah, believe me, I&#xD;
scorn to claim any other reward, than my own conscious&#xD;
reflections. The thought would be unworthy in me ; nor&#xD;
could I dare to hope for your respect, in entertainingit.&#xD;
I know that your whole noble soul would revolt at it.&#xD;
No ; Agnes, understand me. I appreciate the delicacy&#xD;
of your position and my own. That word, 'benefactor,'&#xD;
stands in the way as a barrier. But I ask you, can it&#xD;

" Ah, Mr. Heartful, that I could have saved you and&#xD;
myself from this moment of pain !"&#xD;
" And is it so, Agnes? He whom you call father, is&#xD;
the only benefactor. He it was who trained my youth-&#xD;
ful heart, who instilled into it, by God's blessing, every&#xD;
emotion of good. To him do I owe whatever of good&#xD;
my life has ever brought forth; and it has been but lit-&#xD;

I am worthy of you, or of a kind thought from you, to&#xD;

"Me, a portionless, unknown girl, without family,&#xD;

ine retain my humble position ; and, if God so will, let&#xD;
me unite my hmnble fortunes with one whose name will&#xD;

JONATHAN HEARTFUL IN CONGRESS.   AFFAIRS AT THE&#xD;
RECTORY, NOT SO PLEASANT. TATTLING, JEALOUS-MIND-&#xD;
ED YOUNG LADIES. A LETTER FROM CONGRESS, ETC.&#xD;
JONATHAN HEARTFUL goes to Congress again. But&#xD;
this time he takes his seat in the Senate Chamber. It&#xD;
is an unusually important session, and a very exciting&#xD;
one in the political world. Mr. Heartful distinguished&#xD;
himself in several brilliant speeches, seemed to have&#xD;
acquired new powers of strength of mind and body.&#xD;
He was the champion of the Session; and his name&#xD;
rang throughout the country, from North to South.&#xD;
The daily papers were watched at the Rectory of St.&#xD;
's, with an interest that increased day by day.&#xD;
" Jonathan again !" Mr. Lovegood would exclaim. "lHe&#xD;
will fight them through! He's a perfect lion !" rub-&#xD;
bing his hands with delight. And Agnes would take&#xD;
up the paper, after he laid it aside ; and would steal&#xD;
away to her chamber, and con it over, line by line,&#xD;
again and again. Her full heart welled up with tears of&#xD;
joy and thanksgiving at his success. She knew not&#xD;
that she loved him, otherwise than as a very dear friend;&#xD;
as a benefactor, to whom she owed so much. She dared&#xD;
not trust herself with such a thought. She observed&#xD;
that, when he called to take leave at the Rectory, pre-&#xD;
paratory to his departure for Washington, he was unu-&#xD;
sually sad. But now, in the light of his brillant ca-&#xD;

reer, immersed as he was in national business and its&#xD;
excitements, she doubted not that every tinge of melan-&#xD;
choly had passed away, and that, when lie returned&#xD;
home, she would find every trace of the past obliter-&#xD;
ated This was as she wished. And yet she hung upon&#xD;
his name and words, with an anxiety which betrayed&#xD;
much more than ordinary interest in him.&#xD;
Whenever a letter came to Mr. Lovegood, there was&#xD;
always a kind word for Agnes. She was not forgotten,&#xD;
amidst the most exciting contests. "Give my love to&#xD;
Agnes :" and once he added, underscored, "She knows&#xD;
IWw sincere Iam."  Mr. Lovegood did not observe the&#xD;
crimson flush which suffused her cheek, when he read&#xD;
the sentence. He entertained not the slightest suspicion&#xD;
of what had passed.&#xD;
Meantime, things had gone on as usual in the parish.&#xD;
Mrs. Lovegood had become an invalid; and at the same&#xD;
time she gave proofs of an unamiable temper. Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood begins to fear, that he has made an unfortu-&#xD;
nate match. His bright day which promised so fair,&#xD;
begins to be clouded. -His wife is at times peculiarly&#xD;
taciturn. The parishioners begin to notice it; and the&#xD;
captious busy-bodies are but too happy, that their proph-&#xD;
ecies are fulfilling, while the good and consistent mem-&#xD;
bers of the congregation lament it, and sympathize with&#xD;
their beloved Rector.&#xD;
Even Agnes wears not her usual, happy, cheerful&#xD;
countenance. There is a gloom hanging over the Rec-&#xD;
tory. Indeed, Mrs. Lovegood is growing unkind to&#xD;
the once idolized Agnes; .but all this she keeps from&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood. She at times calls her' "dependent,"&#xD;
and otherwise treats her rudely, saying that Mr. Love-&#xD;

&#xD;
good has enough to do to take care of his own family,&#xD;
without educating and supporting other people's chil-&#xD;
dren.&#xD;
Poor Agnes, for the love she bears her "good father,"&#xD;
resolves to endure it all, with a meek, submissive spirit.&#xD;
The Blemmertons, too, are very bitter against her;&#xD;
and, though they have no intercourse with the family,&#xD;
they occasionally meet her in company, and are but too&#xD;
pointed in their efforts to mortify and wound her feel-&#xD;
ings, on all occasions. "There is that dependentI!"&#xD;
Miss Deliah would remark, just loud enough for her to&#xD;
hear it. And then there would be a twitter among the&#xD;
young ladies, who were jealous of Agnes's attainments,&#xD;
and the attentions paid to her in society. "Yes, how&#xD;
wonderfully smiling she looks !" rejoins Miss Jenny&#xD;
Highflyer. "That sash she thinks becoming; and it&#xD;
would be, if her own money bought it. I wonder she&#xD;
does not learn to do up her curls in a better style."&#xD;
"La, me! if there isn't Mr. Slapperdasher speaking&#xD;
with her. Well, wonders will never cease. Before I'd&#xD;
live as she does, I'd go and learn a trade. Dependent&#xD;
on Mr. Lovegood, even for the clothes she wears. And&#xD;
he calling on the vestry for an increase of salary! I&#xD;
don't wonder at it, when Miss Agnes Wallace is to be&#xD;
dressed and maintained at the expense of St.  's&#xD;
congregation," says the young lady, who forgets that&#xD;
her grandmother kept a beer-shop, and her own father&#xD;
commenced the world with making and selling penny&#xD;
tallow-candles, which he carried about the streets, at&#xD;
retail, upon a pole. 0, but this is a great world; and&#xD;
what magnificent fools a little money makes of some&#xD;
people.&#xD;

"It's actually ridiculous !" says Miss Deliah. "Fa-&#xD;
ther thinks, that Mr. Lovegood's salary is already t o&#xD;
large. Indeed, lie says clergymen ought to have no&#xD;
more than barely enough to live on; they should be&#xD;
kept poor ; it keeps them humble, and in their place."&#xD;
And, Miss Dele, many of them do not have that.&#xD;
The most of their would be satisfied with barely&#xD;
enough. But, lean bones and an humble spirit go to-&#xD;
gether. Yes, yes; it is all right, we apprehend. And&#xD;
it may be, that many more entertain the same view,&#xD;
beside your father. Yes, yes; keep them poor; it&#xD;
makes them behave themselves. They attend only to&#xD;
our spiritual interests ; they put no dollars in our pock-&#xD;
ets; therefore they are of little account. Miss Dele has&#xD;
changed her mind wonderfully. Two hundred thou-&#xD;
sand could not,-well,-but let the young lady speak&#xD;
for herself. "A pretty pass we are coming to, to have&#xD;
such things saddled on the parish. I wonder she does&#xD;
not go out, and learn to make bonnets, or dresses, and&#xD;
support herself. If she had any spirit she certainly&#xD;
would."&#xD;
Agnes, on one occasion, was obliged to hear a great&#xD;
part of such a conversation. She would gladly have&#xD;
withdrawn from her position, and have avoided it; but&#xD;
she could not. Being engaged in conversation herself&#xD;
near the parties, she could not have retired from that&#xD;
part of the room, without rudeness; and these consider-&#xD;
ate young ladies had taken advantage of her situation,&#xD;
on purpose to let her hear a little of their mind !&#xD;
The session of Congress was drawing to a close ; and&#xD;
Mr. Heartful's return was now expected.  One day,&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, on his return from the post-office, handed&#xD;
Agnes a letter. The superscription was in the hand-&#xD;
writing of Mr. Ifeartful. She took it, and retiring to&#xD;
her room, with a trembling hand and throbbing heart,&#xD;
she opened it, and read as follows:&#xD;
"WASHINGTON,       18-.&#xD;
"DEAR AGNES,&#xD;
"The time for me to return to     is drawing&#xD;
near; and I hope soon to have the pleasure of joining&#xD;
the dear friends at the Rectory. lBut my return to&#xD;
at present, depends upon one circumstance. I cannot&#xD;
bear to meet you now, under the circumstances of our&#xD;
parting. Once more I entreat you to revoke youi' de-&#xD;
termination, and permit me to return home and meet&#xD;
you in happiness. Will you not, Agnes? You know&#xD;
me too well, to require that I should use many words.&#xD;
All depends upon your decision. Should you hold out&#xD;
against my ardent devotion, I shall sail for Europe as&#xD;
soon as Congress adjourns, in the hope that, while away,&#xD;
you may make another happy.&#xD;
"Good-by ; God bless you.      J. H1."&#xD;
There, alone in her chamber, did that stricken girl&#xD;
bow now in humble supplication to Heaven.   Here&#xD;
was a new trial across her pathway. Taunted at home&#xD;
and abroad with her poverty and obscurity, her heart&#xD;
revolted at the thought of blending the fortunes of one&#xD;
like Mr. Heartful with her own. And this, not because&#xD;
she attached any importance to such factitious matters&#xD;
as fortune or name; but she had his prosperity at heart,&#xD;
and she feared that she would only trammel him in his&#xD;

career. She was mistaken, it may be; but, still pos-&#xD;
sessed of an humble spirit and sensitive heart, she could&#xD;
bring herself to no other conclusion. If there was a&#xD;
struggle between the promptings of her heart and what&#xD;
she believed to be her duty, it was but for a moment.&#xD;
The next mail bore the answer.&#xD;

" This, rest assured, Mr. leartful, is the most pain-&#xD;
ful hour of my existence, since I have come to years of&#xD;
discretion. You truly said, that we had known sor-&#xD;
rows ; but, when I was a little girl, they came and&#xD;
went, like the passing storm-cloud. Now, they cut&#xD;
their traces deep in the heart.&#xD;
"But ah, it cannot be. Duty to you forbids ; self-&#xD;

pain ; but, if it afford you any consolation, be assured,&#xD;
that it is more than shared by her who pens these&#xD;

days, to enter Mrs. Gilcrist's millinery establishment.&#xD;
"«May you be happy.&#xD;
"AGNES."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood had passed through many trials.&#xD;
Now, for the first time in his life, did a real sorrow fall&#xD;
upon his heart. All else had been but as the slight&#xD;
zephyr playing through the forest, shaking the boughs,&#xD;
and rustling the leaves. This was the terrible tornado,&#xD;

sweeping on in its might, tearing up the giant oaks, and&#xD;
leaving a wreck in its pathway. When Agnes inform-&#xD;
ed hinm of her determination to leave him,and go to&#xD;
Mrs. Gilerist's to learn her trade, the strong man&#xD;
quaked and trembled ; and, for almost the first time in&#xD;
her presence, he wept like a child. His heart almost&#xD;
died within him. " And, my Agnes, will you leave me&#xD;
thus ?" he exclaimed, overpowered with his emotiois.&#xD;
" My daughter, my daughter, whom I have twined&#xD;
about my heart, will she tear herself from me thus ? Oh,&#xD;
that I had been spared this hour !"&#xD;
Mrs. Lovegood, overhearing the conversation, came&#xD;
into the room, and upbraided him with his childish-&#xD;
ness. " It was the best thing the girl could do. She&#xD;
was entirely right ; and she commended her indepen-&#xD;
dence of spirit. Every body was talking about it; the&#xD;
parishioners were complaining. Even Agnes herself&#xD;
had heard some of their remarks. And she was satis-&#xD;
fied, that no woman of spirit would remain in such a&#xD;
position, and hear her name bandied about by every&#xD;
idle gossiper. And if Agnes would take her advice,&#xD;
she would go out at once, and not be dependent on any&#xD;
one. It would certainly be no disgrace to her, but&#xD;
much to her credit."&#xD;
Poor Mr. Lovegood heard all this, with a heavy&#xD;
heart; it was new to him. The cause of Agnes's deter-&#xD;
mination was but too apparent ; nor did he see how it&#xD;
could be remedied. Ie knew that she was devotedly&#xD;
beloved by every member of the congregation whose&#xD;
regard or opinion he deemed worthy of consideration.&#xD;
As to the few gossiping, fault-finding intermeddlers, he&#xD;
deemed what they would say, unworthy of a passing&#xD;
&#xD;
379&#xD;
&#xD;
thought. But he could appreciate Agnes's feelings, and&#xD;
respect her motives ; and he bowed in resignation to her&#xD;
fixed purpose. Indeed, after a day's reflection, he&#xD;
schooled his heart into acquiescence, deeming the&#xD;
course that Agnes had marked out for herself, not only&#xD;
proper, but commendable.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
AGNES IN HER NEW SPHERE. PARTINGS. MR. LOVE-&#xD;
GOOD'S OPINION OF HER COURSE.&#xD;
AGNES WALLACE has entered upon her duties with&#xD;
Mrs. Gilerist. The days of happiness which she had&#xD;
promised herself, under the protection of him to whom&#xD;
she looked as a father, had been clouded soon, ah, too&#xD;
soon. But, such is the course of earthly joys; they&#xD;
never stay. Change, change, is written everywhere;&#xD;
grief rapidly succeeds to joy. Thanks to a benignant&#xD;
Providence, the lowering cloud is ever relieved, how-&#xD;
ever, by the brightening hues of the rainbow of&#xD;
promise, which softly gleam from the midst of its dark&#xD;
folds. The day will come, when there shall be no more&#xD;
sorrows, no more partings. And then, 0 how beautiful&#xD;
shall appear all God's doings with us, when all myste-&#xD;
ries shall be solved, and the history of every sigh and&#xD;
every tear shall be written up. 0, that we could see,&#xD;
how beautiful now are all the ways of that kind Provi-&#xD;
dence which guides our feet towards the promised land.&#xD;
I took my sweet little girl in my arms, yesterday, an&#xD;
innocent little prattler not yet three years old, and&#xD;
walked up and down the long portico of my pretty&#xD;
home. All around us bloomed beautiful roses, and&#xD;
crape-myrtle ; the leaves of the cotton-wood, orange,&#xD;
and weeping willow rustled in the breeze; just before&#xD;
us, all over the garden, luscious, golden peaches hung&#xD;

the midst of the deep green foliage in which they clus-&#xD;
tered, "invited the longing taste."  "See, daughter,"&#xD;
said I, "the beautiful peaches."  "Pretty ! pretty !"&#xD;
exclaimed she, clapping her little hands. "See there,&#xD;
daughter, what beautiful flowers !"  " Pretty.! pretty !"&#xD;
shouting in her gladness of heart. Just then, an insect&#xD;
struck  up  his note, " Chat,-chat,-cchat,-chatter,&#xD;
chatter, sha, sha, sha;" and a beautiful butterfly winged&#xD;
past us, and lit on a cluster of ripe peaches. " 0&#xD;
daughter, hear the sweet katydid ! see the pretty but-&#xD;
terfly !" ."0 pretty, pretty, pretty !" almost bounding&#xD;
from my arms, and exulting in her joy, her bright hazel&#xD;
eyes flashing with delight.&#xD;
Beautiful type of the innocent heart! The little child&#xD;
sees beauty in every thing. Yea, beauty is everywhere,&#xD;
as God is. Beauty is all around us. Every thing is&#xD;
pretty, pretty, 0 how pretty ! God hath written beauty&#xD;
on all His works. Every thing is instinct with lessons&#xD;
on the beauty of His perfections. There is beauty in&#xD;
the evening cloud, tinged with the last rays of the set-&#xD;
ting sun, as they linger behind, loth to leave the world&#xD;
in darkness. There is beauty in the little stars, as one&#xD;
by one they dance out in the heavens, glad to do their&#xD;
Maker's will. There is beauty in the spring-time, when&#xD;
Nature travails in her birth of plenty, and the buds&#xD;
and the blossoms come forth, to cheer the heart and&#xD;
enrobe the earth in gladness. There is beauty in the&#xD;
waving fields and summer harvests, when spring's fair&#xD;
promise ripens into abundance, and crowns man's toils&#xD;
with the blessings of the earth. There is beauty in the&#xD;

autumn sky, with its hoar frosts, and sombre shadows,&#xD;
when Nature doffs her vernal robes, and commits them&#xD;
to the tomb. There is beauty, too, in the hoarse voice&#xD;
and icy grasp of winter, when the birds seek the forests,&#xD;
and the flowers are locked in the'earth, and Nature is&#xD;
clad in mourning.&#xD;
All these beauties proclaim their lesson to man's&#xD;
heart. They are teachers, seeking admission to his so-&#xD;
ciety, in his hours of quiet and meditation, and lifting&#xD;
his soul to the contemplation of things eternal. 'The&#xD;
golden cloud bids us know, that, though the sun be lost&#xD;
to sight, he shines as brightly in other climes, and will&#xD;
come again, to gladden us with his genial beams; even&#xD;
as the Lord of Hosts, in our darkest hours of trial,&#xD;
gives evidence of His sustaining presence; for, when-&#xD;
soever I-e hides His face behind some dark cloud of&#xD;
adversity, if we have but faith, we are sure: to behold&#xD;
His benign likeness in it, and the tokens of His return-&#xD;
ing love. And the little stars bespeak the wonder and&#xD;
order of His providence, and the thousand modes and&#xD;
messengers to convey to us His blessings.&#xD;
Spring, with its blossoming beauties; Summer, with&#xD;
its horn of plenty; Autumn, with its ingathering; and&#xD;
Winter, with its sober gait and icy touch ; all these&#xD;
proclaim the richness and fulness of the divine grace,&#xD;
co-working with God's children through the various pe-&#xD;
riods of their existence here. In the spring-time of life,&#xD;
it gives them the oil of joy and gladness, and the beauty&#xD;
of holiness, to train their young hearts for heaven, and&#xD;

the steadfast faith of durable treasure in heaven; and&#xD;
in the dark hour and winter of death, the cheering&#xD;
hope of immortal glory, an eternal spring-time, when&#xD;
these seeds of corruption, these bodies of mortality,&#xD;
shall spring up immortal and incorrupt, and enjoy un-&#xD;
ending youth in the kingdom of God.&#xD;
Yea, beauty is everywhere ; but man's eyes are&#xD;
holden, man's heart is dumb. He does not see like&#xD;
the innocent little child. lie has no time. He must&#xD;
on. He sees naught, but the changeable and the utili-&#xD;
tarian. Here, to-day ; gone, to-morrow. ie cannot&#xD;
pause for meditation. The world will not stop for him.&#xD;
lie dares not loiter; he sets his heart on the change-&#xD;

things are not bright and beautiful. Teach us, 0 teach&#xD;

The old Rectory no longer resounded with the cheer-&#xD;
ful song of Agnes; nor was her voice longer heard in&#xD;
the solemn morning and evening response. Her ac-&#xD;
customed place was vacant at the table; the young&#xD;
persons who used to assemble, at the pleasant evening&#xD;
hour, at the Rectory, no longer gladdened the genial&#xD;
Rector's heart. But, every morning and evening, there&#xD;
ascended to heaven a prayer for the absent one.&#xD;
Agnes came occasionally, and spent an evenling with&#xD;

384        THE BLEMMERTONs; OR,&#xD;
her father ; but it was too painfully evident, that a&#xD;
change had come over every thing at the Rectory. She&#xD;
always met the same cordial embrace and thrilling&#xD;
" God bless you, my daughter ;" but, sorrow had writ-&#xD;
ten its lines, deeply, upon the brow of her "good&#xD;
father."  Change was visible there: the cloud had&#xD;
gathered ; the storm-king reigned.&#xD;
Mr. IHeartful had gone to Europe, to be absent sev-&#xD;
eral years. Over this, too, there was an impenetrable&#xD;
mystery, which hung heavily upon Mr. Lovegood's&#xD;
heart. He spoke of it to Agnes, as he read to her&#xD;
some passages from a letter which he had just received&#xD;
from Mr. Heartful. "I cannot see you now, for some&#xD;
years, my dear pastor and guardian of my youth. I&#xD;
could not now greet the dear ones at the Rectory!&#xD;
Tlie is a pall upon my spirits, which, for two years&#xD;
or more, must deprive me of that pleasure.  Good-&#xD;
by.  Give my love to Agnes; protect and defend&#xD;
her in her trials, and the Lord's blessing will be upon&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" What does that mean, my Agnes ?" said he.&#xD;
"There is a mysterious meaning in these words, which&#xD;
I cannot solve. There is a secret sorrow hidden under&#xD;
them, that I fain would understand !" " From you who&#xD;
have been more than a father to me, I dare not with-&#xD;
hold any thing that can contribute to allay your anxie-&#xD;
ties," said she, sobbing aloud. " I will tell you all!"&#xD;
And then, to the sympathizing mind of a father, she&#xD;
disclosed the secret of her heart, relating all that had&#xD;
passed between herself and Mr. lleartful. Into the&#xD;
sorrows of that moment let us not irreverently gaze.&#xD;
"The heart knoweth its own bitterness." Sighs and&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.              385&#xD;
tears tell us whereof we are made. They are good for&#xD;
us, when they draw us heavenward.&#xD;
And let none suppose, that sorrows such as these have&#xD;
about them nothing of a sanctified impress or charac-&#xD;
ter. They may not have, it is true ; but we should be&#xD;
loth so to tamper with human affections, and the sor-&#xD;
rows springing out of them, as to consider them as&#xD;
belonging exclusively to the purely sentimental or&#xD;
romantic. Far from it. Why may not such sorrows be&#xD;
a portion of the cup which our Father gives us to drink&#xD;
as well as others ? All sorrow is the product of sin.&#xD;
Sin hath flooded the world with tears ; and, from the&#xD;
weak infant wail, to the heavy cross which the mature&#xD;
Christian is called to bear, from the trial which wrings&#xD;
the heart of innocent childhood, to that which brings a&#xD;
tremor into the frame and languor upon the brow of&#xD;
age, we behold the complement and fulfilment of that&#xD;
probation through wlicl we all are to pass. Anguish&#xD;
is wr'ittenl everywhlere;insickness, in disappointments,&#xD;
in heart-blightings, in wants, in crosses, ini partings.&#xD;
But the young heart is elastic. Yea, it is true. Tt&#xD;
breaks and. weeps like the cloud of spring. Its sun&#xD;
comes out, and all again is fresh and bright. The cloud&#xD;
vanishes, and the youthful sky is calm and serene.&#xD;
Yea, youth is compensative. But for this, the youthful&#xD;
heart would break, and never be healed. And yet,&#xD;
sorrow never comes without leaving its mark. The&#xD;
reader may not be conscious of this;but, could we tell&#xD;
his experience, we could point out, in the inner recesses&#xD;
of his being, the mark of some past sorrow which&#xD;
though for the moment forgotten, is laid up in the&#xD;
recesses of memory. And that memory is a curious&#xD;

386        TILE BLEM MER TONS; On,&#xD;
palimpsest; and, one by one, as age lays on its gray&#xD;
hairs, or turns over the leaves of that palimpsest, those&#xD;
marks will be revealed to them. Their youthful sor-&#xD;
and blightings will reveal themselves as in a&#xD;
mirror; they will read them, look upon them; they&#xD;
will live again in the past, and weep, and bless memory&#xD;
for its revelations; and, perchance, they will hope for&#xD;
the day when the book of memory shall be fully opened,&#xD;
and they shall muse on all the past, and live in the sun-&#xD;
light of heaven's eternal day.&#xD;
There are lines, even of sorrow, in every mans&#xD;
life, buried in the past, on which he loves to meditate,&#xD;
and which draw him heavenward, if in them he sees&#xD;
the marks of his Lord, and they are weaning him from&#xD;
earth and fitting him for the world to come.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood listened to the recital of Agnes's sor-&#xD;
wlauhing and weeping. "Noble Jonathan, noble&#xD;
Ages !"he exclaimed, as she concluded. "It's like&#xD;
you both.  le is all generosity; his noble heart over-&#xD;
flows with every chivalrouis, magnanimllouS senntlient.&#xD;
I know not, my dear daughter, how you have endured&#xD;
such a severe trial. You have my sympathies ; and I&#xD;
appreciate your sentiments. You are worthy of each&#xD;
other. And I am thankful, that you have been enabled&#xD;
thus fully to sustain yourself, in a position which you&#xD;
conscientiously believe to be right.&#xD;
"But," continued he, "have you not been wrong, my&#xD;
dauhter ? Does Christian virtue require you to sacni-&#xD;
fice your own and another's happiness, on account of&#xD;
what you might suppose the world would say ? The&#xD;
world, I know, is prone to harshness and false judgment.&#xD;
But we are not to be governed by the wrong judgments&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.              8&#xD;
or censures of the wicked. Public opinion is as apt,&#xD;
perhaps, to be wrong as right. It often sets up a false&#xD;
standard ; and if we suffer ourselves to be ruled by this,&#xD;
we shall be robbed, not only of much of our Christian&#xD;
boldness, but even of our just rights. Yet, after all,&#xD;
there is a great deal of right judgment in the world.&#xD;
The censorious and the evil-minded are not the. sole&#xD;
judges in the world. The good, the pious, the gener-&#xD;
ous, and the just, also, have opinions, and they sustain&#xD;
worthy actions, and measure our deeds by the standard&#xD;
of justice. The world is not all one-sided and lynx-&#xD;
eyed. There is some goodness in it. There are those&#xD;
whose smile of approbation is as the sunshine, and&#xD;
whose good opinion and just judgments are as the dews&#xD;
of evening upon the parched earth."&#xD;
"If," replied she, " I had no higher motive than&#xD;
that named, it would perhaps be erroneous. I would&#xD;
be willing to disregard the remarks of the censorious&#xD;
and evil-minded ; and I am sure Mr. Ileartful would.&#xD;
We should be happy in each other, let others say what&#xD;
they might. But there are higher and more dutiful&#xD;
considerations. Mr. I. is above my sphere in life. I&#xD;
covet only an humble walk; he has a brilliant career&#xD;
before him ; I should, I fear, only trammel him in his&#xD;
just aspirations. I esteem and respect him too highly,&#xD;
to stand in the way of either his usefulness or his aspira-&#xD;
tions. You know, that the envious, who know all my&#xD;
past sad history, would say, that he had married beneath&#xD;
himself ; and had united his fortunes with one whom he&#xD;
had beemiinstrumental in rescuing from the most abject&#xD;
misery and poverty. And this, while it would not&#xD;
affect the happiness of either of us directly, would be&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7334-00000195"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
used against him at every step. How could I forgive&#xD;
myself for so rash an act? I may be wrong ; but, when&#xD;
I calmly reflect on the subject, it appears that we had&#xD;
better endure a brief period of heart-grief, than tinge&#xD;
our whole life with sorrow. To you, my dear father, I&#xD;
will not hesitate to say, that the sacrifice has been&#xD;
great; but we share it together, and grace will be&#xD;
vouchsafed to us, to bear it, as becometh Christians."&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, though not assenting to all her con-&#xD;
clusions, could find it in his heart to say no more. "God&#xD;
bless you, my daughter! You are a dear good girl;&#xD;
and I hope and believe, there is a brighter day before&#xD;
you. You are called to trials in youth, that your age&#xD;
may, I trust, be blessed the more abundantly. The&#xD;
dark days will assuredly roll away, and bright ones&#xD;
come at last. Trust in the Lord and be strong. One&#xD;
so pure, so innocent, so unselfish as my own good Ag-&#xD;
nes, is not allowed to pass through the furnace, without&#xD;
some wise and holy purpose.&#xD;
"Bless God, then," continued he, "and go on the&#xD;
way rejoicing. Let whatever may betide you, you&#xD;
know in whom you have a friend, who will never desert&#xD;
you, while he lives; and, above and better than all,&#xD;
you know the goodness and mercy of the Friend of&#xD;
friends, without whose friendship all others were of lit-&#xD;
tle worth."&#xD;

WAs Agnes, the milliner-girl deserted by her hosts&#xD;
of admirers? Nay; not by all. Mr. Slapperdasher,&#xD;
and a few others of the cane and kid order, cut her ac-&#xD;
quaintance; so also did the Misses IIighflyer, Beaudash-&#xD;
er, and the like. The Elemmertons, of course, deemed&#xD;
her altogether beneath their notice; before, she had&#xD;
been the " dependent," a spiritless dependent, living on&#xD;
the charities of the parish ; now, she was a common&#xD;
milliner, altogether unworthy of a passing consideration.&#xD;
But gentlemen and ladies who were more worthy of&#xD;
these titles, sought her society as usual, and cheered her&#xD;
on in her honorable course. She was a superior womn-&#xD;
an, and made her mark wherever she went. Persons&#xD;
of intelligence, refinement, and true discrimination,&#xD;
gladly extended to her the courtesies to which her at-&#xD;

when the "almighty dollar" was the sole conduceur&#xD;

needle. Labor, the lot of man, was no disgrace, except&#xD;
in the eyes of such as the Elemmertons, who had sprung&#xD;

for the society of the refined, the liberal-minded, chiv-&#xD;
alrous, and enlightened, was freely admitted to it,&#xD;
whether she bore the ungrateful cognomen of the " Mil-&#xD;
liner-girl," as the Blemmertons always characterized&#xD;
Agnes, or drove her splendid carriage, or trod the&#xD;
downy-carpeted parlor, or flashed her diamonds before&#xD;
the costly mirror.&#xD;
Agnes, from motives of delicacy and humility, and&#xD;
from finding it more congenial to her sentiments and&#xD;
feelings, went but little into company, much to the re-&#xD;
gret of many of her real friends, who found in her so-&#xD;
ciety a refining, elevating, and chastening influence.&#xD;
She was a true woman; and she determined to fill her&#xD;
sphere in life. Her highest delight was to discharge&#xD;
her duties to Mrs. Gilcrist, and be found always in her&#xD;
place in the sanctuary at the hour of prayer.&#xD;
In a few months, sh had made herself so useful in&#xD;
the business of her employer, as to be promoted from&#xD;
the needle to the post of chief sales-woman ; and every&#xD;
day found her behind the counter, waiting upon the&#xD;
flocks of ladies who patronized the house. And Agnes&#xD;
was so refined and ladylike, so free from all " the tricks&#xD;
of trade," so fair and honorable in all her dealings, that&#xD;
Mrs. Gilcrist's custom tebled itself in a few months.&#xD;
The usual chaffering and Jewing in the establish-&#xD;
ment ceased, except when such as the Blemmertons&#xD;
called, who merely intended to exult over Agnes, glory&#xD;
in their pride and ostentation, prate about their conse-&#xD;

knowing her of course ;) " all milliner-girls are I believe&#xD;
trained at their business, which is to get the most they&#xD;
can. They will cheat if they get a chance ; they re-&#xD;
quire to be closely watched." But all ladies of real&#xD;
refinement shrunk from all chaffering with the charm-&#xD;
ing Miss Wallace ; for there was no necessity of close&#xD;
dealing with her. She dealt as a Christian should&#xD;
deal; and inspired confidence in all riglit-minded cus-&#xD;
tomers.&#xD;
Many ladies, as they retired from the store, were&#xD;
heard to remark, " Really, it does one's heart good, to&#xD;
deal with Miss Wallace in these crooked times; so&#xD;
much of a lady, so frank, so free from guile ; if there's&#xD;
even a straw out of place, or a speck on a ribbon, it's&#xD;
sure to be pointed out."  And, indeed, we must say, to&#xD;
the credit of all ladies in general, that, notwithstanding&#xD;
the many sore thrusts and hard hits they so often re-&#xD;
ceive about their chaffering, trouble-making, Jewing,&#xD;
and beating down, if dealers would be a little more&#xD;
generous and just, would not proceed upon the principle&#xD;
that all persons who enter their places of business in-&#xD;
tend, if they can, to take advantage of them, and would&#xD;
not "mark up" on their goods for the sake of leaving&#xD;
room to " fall," there would be less of it.&#xD;
But, as it is, a lady can hardly be a good economical&#xD;
shopper, and have justice measured out to her, as&#xD;
well as miuslins, without acquiring the " Jewing " art.&#xD;
Clerks and salesmen, gentlemen and ladies of the yard-&#xD;
stick, be wise ; quit the naughty practice. Place upon&#xD;
your goods an honest, living proW, and have done with&#xD;
the dishonest, dishonorable trickery of " marking " up,&#xD;
and then "selling your goods below cost." For my&#xD;

part, I never deal with a man who always sells below cost,&#xD;
who gives out the stereotyped expression, " It cost me&#xD;
more than the money."   I think he either intends to&#xD;
cheat me, or accounts me a fool or a knave. I know&#xD;
that he cannot live by such a trade, unless his goods&#xD;
are stolen, and I leave it to some one else, to impose&#xD;
upon his charity, or good nature.&#xD;
Time rolls on, bringing its changes and vicissitudes.&#xD;
Mrs. Goodenough has paid the debt of nature, and&#xD;
gone to join her sainted partner in Paradise. Mr. No-&#xD;
church has been confirmed ; and is now regularly found&#xD;
at the altar, whenever the Holy Sacrament is adminis-&#xD;
tered. He has become a truly pious, devoted, and ac-&#xD;
tive man in the Church, a second Mr. Friendly, co-&#xD;
operating with the Reetor, in every good word and&#xD;
work.&#xD;
Miss Sally Fastidious has married Mr. Ben Slocum's&#xD;
opponent, "the red-headed fellow, Ben Jenkins."&#xD;
And Mr. Slocum himself is the same grinning, trifling,&#xD;
wishy-washy Presbyterian that he was when we last&#xD;
saw him.&#xD;
Mrs. Nochurch, Mrs. Fussy, Mrs. Fastidious, amid&#xD;
Dr. Riproarer, still court each other as of old, while&#xD;
the ladies sound his trumpet far and near. Dr. Rip-&#xD;
roarer is a very great man; so " they" say, and that is&#xD;
enough. Mr. Lovegood, of course, and his troubles at&#xD;
home, are happy subjects of comment, and afford the&#xD;
ladies many delightful moments of recreation. Mr.&#xD;
Slopill and Miss Dole keep on terms; they never appear&#xD;
at church ; nor does Mr. Slopill know any thing of the&#xD;
visit to the Rectory, the rapid coming and going of the&#xD;
crimson in the cheek, and the great disappointment&#xD;
&#xD;
392&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.              393&#xD;
felt on that occasion. These are all profound secrets.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood is a very bad man ; tried hard to sup-&#xD;
plant Mr. Slopill, but could not succeed. Miss Dele,&#xD;
with the two hundred thousand, was not to be won&#xD;
from his grasp so easily. Mr. Slopill, of course, brushed&#xD;
his whiskers, and looked in the glass. Whew ! he is a&#xD;
man of consequence, much too hard for the Rector. If&#xD;
there is saw-dust about his eyes, he cannot see it. And&#xD;
the gossiping deserters, being for the most part " cut"&#xD;
by the true friends of the Church, their croaking raises&#xD;
but light storms.&#xD;
The elder Blemmertons still remain in statu quo.&#xD;
Mr. Ifeartful has gone to Europe, and, when he returns,&#xD;
will most likely make good the old prophecy. He and&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood are devoted friends ; it is therefore best&#xD;
not to act hastily. Prudence is a wonderful guide, and&#xD;
often accomplishes great things.&#xD;
Agnes being out of the way, and affairs having settled&#xD;
down, Mrs. Blemmerton and Miss Dele determined to&#xD;
call again at the Rectory. If they gain nothing by it&#xD;
in one way, they may in another ; they may pick up&#xD;
something to talk about, touching the freaks of the&#xD;
Rector's lady; and that will afford some satisfaction.&#xD;
But this visit was never repeated; they heard some-&#xD;
thing not very congenial to delicate, sensitive nerves.&#xD;
Mrs. Lovegood had here and there picked up a thread&#xD;
of the old stories, which she had woven into a net-&#xD;
work, and being that morning in one of her cross&#xD;
moods, she spread it over the Blemmertons so thick and&#xD;
fast, that they came near losing their eye-sight, and&#xD;
suffocating under the operation. At last, rising in a&#xD;
pitch of indignation, she darted into an adjoining rooni,&#xD;

and brought forth, holding it aloft in her hand, and&#xD;
swaying it to and fro as a grand trophy, the veritable&#xD;
sermon-holder.&#xD;
" There," said she, pitching it at the same time into&#xD;
Miss Dele's lap, " there is the seimon-holder that court-&#xD;
ed Mr. Lovegood, that you made, Miss Dele, with yOur&#xD;
purse. Take it !"  0 ye tempestuous elements, blow&#xD;
your blasts! Your howlings, your mighty roarings are&#xD;
not heard. An earthquake would not have been so.&#xD;
terrific. Mrs. Blemmerton groaned and gashed her&#xD;
teeth. The ladies left the house in a rush and a storm,&#xD;
choking with rage. "Insulted, grossly insulted, in the&#xD;
house of the Rector !" Close the scene.&#xD;
Here was an affair ! What was now to be done ?&#xD;
What, but permit the choler to boil down. There is no&#xD;
other cure in such a case. Like a fever, it must take&#xD;
its course ; all that can be done is to mollify and apply&#xD;
palliatives. With all their failings, the Blemmertons&#xD;
had the vanity to keep the main point of the insult to&#xD;
themselves. It cut too deeply and severely; in exposing&#xD;
the wound, they could only have exposed themselves.&#xD;
The fact that they had been grossly insulted by Mrs.&#xD;
Lovegood, was liberally and bountifully retailed, but&#xD;
the leal grounds thereof, no ingenuity could ever draw&#xD;
from them.&#xD;
It is not agreeable to record such incidents in the&#xD;
character of a clergyman's wife. It is to be presumed,&#xD;
however, that most persons expect to.find in them flesh&#xD;
and blood; though it must be owned, that a great&#xD;
many expect more from the wives of the clergy than&#xD;
of any other men. They are expected to visit more,&#xD;
be more at home, live on less, be more charitable, talk&#xD;

less and know less, yet do more, than any other ladies.&#xD;
They are more scandalized, envied, talked about, than&#xD;
it is profitable to relate. If Mrs. Rector gets a new&#xD;
bonnet, every body is agog to see it come to church ;&#xD;
and then it is too gay, or too dashy, or too expensive ;&#xD;
it is extravagant, or it has too many flowers,-flowers,&#xD;
the beautiful things,-the prettiest things in the world,-&#xD;
flowers, made by the hand divine to make glad our&#xD;
hearts, and create music in the world, 0 ye are sinful&#xD;
things in the bonnet of a Mrs. Rector ! Well, its bad&#xD;
enough, without our writing about it. Still, we must&#xD;
write our experiences. We ask not the reader's belief.&#xD;
Say it's all made up; we are -satisfied. But we know&#xD;
what we know.&#xD;
Mrs. Lovegood was, in many respects, a most excel-&#xD;
lent woman.; but she had one besetting infirmity,-&#xD;
cross turns, contrary fits, spasmodic turns of crooked-&#xD;
ness, which seemed to come and go like the whimsies&#xD;
of a petted child. When the fit was off, she was all&#xD;
that was excellent, a gem of a wife, who was ready for&#xD;
any thing good ; to lend her mantilla for a pattern, or&#xD;
to visit the sick, or to move among the parishioners, all&#xD;
charms and graces; but when it was on, she was a&#xD;
" Tartar ;" she snapped, and snarled at every thing and&#xD;
every body. These crooked spells generally lasted&#xD;
about an hour; but while they were on, Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
was always minus the drawing-room and study. It was&#xD;
too warm for him about the house.&#xD;
These peculiarities, when fully developed, were soon&#xD;
known; and though very painful to Mr. Lovegood and&#xD;
the parishioners, they resolved to bear them, in the&#xD;
spirit of good Christians, with the best possible grace.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Lovegood was, herself, painfully conscious of her&#xD;
peculiar failing, and strove against it, at times, with he-&#xD;
roic fortitude. After her severe cut on the Blemer-&#xD;
tons, she learned to deny herself to visitors when she&#xD;
was in one of her unpleasant moods, which doubtless&#xD;
saved her from many serious evils.&#xD;
She was a confirmed dyspeptic: change of living and&#xD;
of climate had preyed upon her health, until she was,&#xD;
at times, perfectly wretched ; and then she could not&#xD;
avoid making others about her unhappy. -Doubtless,&#xD;
Christian charity would have said, that the poor lady&#xD;
was more to be pitied than censured. At all events, we&#xD;
feel inclined to draw the veil over many of her failings,&#xD;
especially as she labored prayerfully to conquer them.&#xD;
But we must not forbear recording one or two of her&#xD;
most remarkable acts.&#xD;
Numbers of the parishioners felt very kindly toward&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood, and often remembered him, with small&#xD;
presents and tokens of regard. Mr. Friendly was par-&#xD;
ticularly thoughtful in this way. If he met with any&#xD;
thing in market, that he thought would please the&#xD;
Rector, he was sure to purchase a double quantity, one&#xD;
half of which would find its way to the Rectory, always&#xD;
borne to the door in his own hand. One morning, at&#xD;
an early hour, he rang the bell, and handed to the ser-&#xD;
vant a very fine goose. Imagine his surprise, as he&#xD;
turned the corner, and passed on by the kitchen, at&#xD;
seeing a window raised and the whole goose hurled out&#xD;
at his head, barely missing the mark, and rolling along&#xD;
before him on the pavement.&#xD;
Acts of this kind Mrs. L. would frequently perpe-&#xD;

rate, and then, in ten minutes, be found in her chain-&#xD;
ber, bathed in tears of shame. So strange a thing is&#xD;
dyspepsia.&#xD;
On one occasion, Mr. Lovegood was quite sick. He&#xD;
had a high fever, and the physician had requested him&#xD;
not to see much company; to admit into his room a few&#xD;
only of his friends, and but one at a time. This alarmed&#xD;
Mrs. L., very much. She deemed the case a very crit-&#xD;
ical one, and watched her husband with great anxiety.&#xD;
Early one morning, Mr. Friendly, on his way to busi-&#xD;
ness, called; and, as was his custom, walked directly to&#xD;
the door of the sick room, and, gently tapping, softly&#xD;
opened it, and was entering the room, when, suddenly,&#xD;
he felt a decided negative pressure; and, before he&#xD;
knew what it was, he found himself tightly jammed be-&#xD;
tween the sharp edge of the door and the door-facing,&#xD;
and clamped as tightly as a wedge. "You can't come&#xD;
in, Sir !" said a voice from the negative force, which&#xD;
negative force grew tighter and tighter, till the poor old&#xD;
gentleman, who was already pretty thin, was nearly&#xD;
flattened to the thinness of a board. lie declared, af-&#xD;
terward, that he had, for weeks, a red and blue stripe,&#xD;
up and down, behind and before, where he had been&#xD;
confined in the stocks.&#xD;
Two years rolled round, bringing to Mrs. Lovegood&#xD;
restored health; and, as her health improved, she over-&#xD;
came these unpleasant traits, and lived to see the day,&#xD;
when she was as much beloved and respected, by all the&#xD;
parishioners, as, before that, she had been dreaded. In&#xD;
later life, she was often heard to lament her earlier fail-&#xD;
ings; and frequently would she join in the merry laugh,&#xD;

COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE THEM.&#xD;
LETTER FROM MR. HEARTFUL. REVELATIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
WE are ahead of our story. Mr. Heartful has been&#xD;
absent for two years ; and, in all that time, Mr. Love-&#xD;
good has received but two letters from him, the latter&#xD;
towards the end of the first year .of his absence. It&#xD;
breathed a spirit of melancholy, and was full of kind&#xD;
remembrances to all at the Rectory, and of love to&#xD;
"dear Agnes," underscored, and written in a trembling&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
One bright afternoon in September, towards the close&#xD;
of Mr. Heartful's second year's absence, Mr. Lovegood&#xD;
called at Mrs. Gilerist's, and taking Agnes aside, told&#xD;
her that he had something of importance to commnuni-&#xD;
cate to her, and wished her to come to the Rectory, in&#xD;
the evening, when she would be relieved from business.&#xD;
his manner was significant. His large, full eyes&#xD;
beamed with delight, and flashed as when his whole,&#xD;
soul was thrown into them.&#xD;
Agnes hastened to the Rectory, about eight o'clock.&#xD;
Mr. Lovegood was alone in his study. When she&#xD;
entered and was seated, he unlocked a drawer in his&#xD;
desk, and drew forth a letter which he handed to&#xD;
Agnes. It bore a foreign postmark. There: was no&#xD;
mistaking the writer. Yes; it was from Mr. Heartful.&#xD;
"Read it, my daughter; it concerns you'!" said Mr. L.,&#xD;

as he gave it to her, and immediately dropped into his&#xD;
seat, and, burying his face in his hands, sobbed aloud.&#xD;
" Joy to the true of heart !" he ejaculated. " The God&#xD;
of the fatherless is mighty! All praise be unto Him&#xD;
who doeth all things well!' "&#xD;
Agnes read as follows:&#xD;
LIVERPOOL,        18-.&#xD;
MY DEAR PAsTOR :-You have doubtless been sur&#xD;
prised at my long silence; but I can now solve all&#xD;
mysteries. From the first month of my sojourn in&#xD;
England, I have been engaged in unravelling a curious&#xD;
and difficult affair. By the merest accident, I learned&#xD;
that a gentleman of your name had died recently, leav-&#xD;
ing a large fortune without heirs in England.&#xD;
My curiosity being excited, I inquired into the&#xD;
matter. The gentleman's name was Robert Lovegood.&#xD;
But either from a desire to embezzle the property, or to&#xD;
baffle the curiosity of a stranger, the officials threw&#xD;
every imaginable obstacle in my way. At last, how-&#xD;
ever, I succeeded in ferreting out the facts in the case ;&#xD;
and you may imagine my surprise, when I discovered,&#xD;
that the deceased was either a brother or cousin of&#xD;
yours.&#xD;
And what is better than all, anu by what unaccount-&#xD;
able train of circumstances it was brought about I&#xD;
know not,-but our dear Agnes is, by his will, the&#xD;
inheritor of his whole fortune. I give you the very&#xD;
words of the will, and you may judge for yourself.&#xD;
" After paying all my just and equitable debts, I give&#xD;
and bequeath all my estate, whether personal, real,&#xD;
or mixed, a statement of which I have filed with my&#xD;
&#xD;
friend A. B., unto the heir or heirs of my cousin, Mary.&#xD;
Wallace, late of England, but now residing in the&#xD;
United States; and I require and charge my executors,&#xD;
as aforesaid, etc."&#xD;
Agnes read no more. She stood mute, and as if&#xD;
transfixed to the floor. And was the poor orphan, de-&#xD;
pendent, milliner-girl, an heiress? And what were her&#xD;
emotions?  At the end of the letter there was this&#xD;
postscript: "I can come home now. When this busi-&#xD;
ness is. all arranged, I shall take my departure, and&#xD;
greet you all again, I trust, in three months."&#xD;
Shortly after the death of Mrs. Wallace, Mr. Love-&#xD;
good had written to his brother, informing him of her&#xD;
sad history and death, and giving him an account of&#xD;
his intentions towards Agnes. To this letter he had not&#xD;
received a reply ; and he concluded, that his brother&#xD;
had long since died or removed elsewhere.&#xD;
After the failure of Robert Lovegood, and the sacri-&#xD;
fice made by Richard Grantner, and his sister Mary, to&#xD;
pay his liabilities, for which Richard was surety, the&#xD;
wheel of fortune turned in his favor, and Robert Love-&#xD;
good, in the course of a few years, found himself in a&#xD;
flourishing business. He wrote often to his cousins, but&#xD;
never received any intelligence of them.&#xD;
He rarely ever heard of his mother or brother. If&#xD;
they corresponded at all, it was at long intervals; pov-&#xD;
erty and a life of changes and vicissitudes, on the one&#xD;
hand, and the absorbing cares of business, on the other,&#xD;
served to curtail their communications, until at length&#xD;
they ceased.&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
It had ever been the intention of Robert Lovegood,&#xD;
to repair the loss sustained by his cousins ; but, as we&#xD;
have shown, after he acquired the ability, he had, from&#xD;
the want of proper intelligence respecting them, been&#xD;
unable to fulfil his purpose.&#xD;
Years rolled round ; and he had amassed a large for-&#xD;
tune. He had married, but was childless; and his&#xD;
wife had now been dead six or eight years. The letter&#xD;
of his brother had been duly received, and he was about&#xD;
to make arrangements to forward him a large draft, for&#xD;
the benefit of Agnes, when he was attacked with his&#xD;
last illness. But, upon the intelligence contained in his&#xD;
brother's letter, he based his will.&#xD;
The executors had, for nearly six years, with that&#xD;
letter in their hands, which placed them in possession&#xD;
of every necessary item of intelligence, studiously&#xD;
avoided writing to Mr. Lovegood, to inform him of the&#xD;
death of his brother, and of the fortune bequeathed to&#xD;
Agnes.&#xD;
Agnes retained her situation at Mrs. Gilcrist's, though&#xD;
her change of fortune was soon noised abroad. She&#xD;
and Mr. Lovegood were required to appear before a&#xD;
Court of Record; and several influential citizens were&#xD;
required to testify to the fact of her being the identical&#xD;
heir of Mary Wallace. When this occurred, the sub-&#xD;
ject was no longer a secret. But Agnes continued to&#xD;
be the same modest, retiring, unassuming Christian&#xD;
that she had ever been, and was found every day&#xD;
behind the counter,as assiduous as ever in the duties of&#xD;
her employment.&#xD;
Those who had been her true friends, rejoiced in her&#xD;
good fortune. But they neither loved, nor caressed, nor&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
DOTTING BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
admired her the more on this account. She could long&#xD;
since have returned to the Rectory, without any com-&#xD;
promise of her feelings.; for Mrs. Lovegood, having re-&#xD;
covered from her ill health, yearned to have her socie-&#xD;
ty again. But Agnes found so much delight in her oc-&#xD;
cupation, that she preferred to continue it. And now,&#xD;
that her fortunes had so wonderfully changed, she re-&#xD;
mained at her post, from a sense of propriety.&#xD;
But what a marked change had been wrought in&#xD;
some other quarters! The worshippers of Mammon&#xD;
now vied with each other, to see who could be most&#xD;
profuse in praises and attentions. The Blemmertons&#xD;
thought her a most charming girl, regretted that they&#xD;
had enjoyed so little of her society, and made many&#xD;
humble apologies that they had not paid her more at-&#xD;
tention. " The truth was," they said, "their list of&#xD;
friends had so extended, that they scarcely knew how to&#xD;
reckon them. And if Miss Wallace had been over-&#xD;
looked, they hoped to be forgiven, as it was purely ac-&#xD;
cidental."  Card after card, and congratulation after&#xD;
congratnlation,\poured in upon Agnes. Mr. Slapper-&#xD;
dasher called in his carriage, for a ride ; and the Misses&#xD;
Highflyer and Beaudasher sent their compliments, on&#xD;
many occasions, requesting the pleasure of Miss Wal-&#xD;
lace's company.&#xD;
Agnes had not one grain of resentment in her com-&#xD;
position. She knew how unreal and hollow-hearted all&#xD;
this lip-service was, but she did not give her thoughts to&#xD;
it. She took all things as they occurred, with a good and&#xD;
honest heart. At peace with herself and her God and&#xD;
Saviour, she was not elated at what the world called&#xD;
her good fortune ; but she cherished the more the mem-&#xD;

Mr. Pen Slocum Sapientium, doubtless at the sugges-&#xD;
tion of a wiser head than his own, became one of Miss&#xD;
Wallace's most ardent admirers. And the same old de-'&#xD;
vices were resorted to, and a world of trouble taken, to&#xD;
ingratiate Mr. Sapientium into her good graces. Little&#xD;
parties were assembled, here and there, and things were&#xD;
dexterously managed by a ruling hand, so as to throw&#xD;
them together on numerous occasions.&#xD;
A report was soon in circulation, that Mr. Pen Sb-&#xD;
cum was going to do Miss Wallace the honor of taking&#xD;
care of her fortune. Of course, it was a good and char-&#xD;
itable act in the aforesaid Ben; a considerate act, that&#xD;
entitled him to a large amount of self-approbation. She&#xD;
was a lone girl, and needed a helping hand in the man-&#xD;
agement of her estate. For this, Mr. Slocum was ad-&#xD;
mirably calculated ! Who will say it was not a charity&#xD;
in lim,,to entertain so good an intention ? Gentle read-&#xD;
er, give Mr. Slocum the credit that is his due, while&#xD;
we unfold one more page in his history.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
A CASE OF SUPERSTITION, SHOWING HOW MR. BEN SLOCUM&#xD;
BECAME FULLY PERSUADED THAT HE WAS TO BECOME&#xD;
THE GUARDIAN OF AGNES'S FORTUNE. A SCENTED LET-&#xD;
TER. MR. LOVEGOOD SAYING A HARD WORD.&#xD;
TILE most yielding bodies in Nature, such as Air,&#xD;
Water, Steam, are said to be the most powerful agents.&#xD;
We do not avouch for it. Let it pass for what it is&#xD;
worth ; or, if the question must be discussed, we leave&#xD;
it to those whose province it is to elucidate such learned&#xD;
topics.&#xD;
But, we are confident, that there is an analogy in-the&#xD;
intellectual world ; things the most light and airy are&#xD;
frequently the most potential. The speculative notions&#xD;
of the hair-brained theorist, are often found adequate to&#xD;
the task of throwing into the shade, to some minds,&#xD;
truths that ages of wisdom and experience have illus-&#xD;
trated and verified. A quack always performs mira-&#xD;
cles, and gets credit for what he does not, while the&#xD;
regular practitioner gains no credit for what he does.&#xD;
And so with mankind generally; one portion of the&#xD;
race plods along at a slow pace, in a beaten path ; an-&#xD;
other reaches the goal in half the time, on the pathway&#xD;
of quackery and pretension.&#xD;
The truth is, there is a superabundance of superstition&#xD;
in the human family; and this is the element that all pre-&#xD;
te nders lay hold upon. Joseph Miller did it ; and so did&#xD;
J -iseph Smith, and Mahomet; so also does the "Spirit-&#xD;

rapping" mummery ; nor are they the only quacks the&#xD;
world has produced in the pseudo-religious line. We&#xD;
could name several scores of them ; but, in many quar-&#xD;
ters, we should not receive the credit due to the dis-&#xD;
covery.&#xD;
Talk about the Salem Witchcraft as you please, as an&#xD;
exploded piece of foolery, we aver that it is not explod-&#xD;
ed. It lives in one form or another, and, ever and&#xD;
anon, manifests itself in some new phase, dress, or phe-&#xD;
nomenon. There are numerous believers in the " Dark&#xD;
Mystery ;" the world is full of superstition, of Hags, too,&#xD;
and Wizards. The doctrine of Fatality, "what is to&#xD;
be will be," which has been fostered, even by many re-&#xD;
ligionists, has had no small influence in keeping alive and&#xD;
developing superstition, in some 'shape or form. But&#xD;
we will not discuss the question. We merely assert the&#xD;
fact, that superstition does exist. The Salem Witch-&#xD;
craft has left its mark.&#xD;
We know many persons, who would not set out on a&#xD;
journey on a FRIDAY, or commence any new work on&#xD;
that day ; many more, who have their lucky and un-&#xD;
lucky omens, good and bad dreams, to which they at-&#xD;
tach great importance. Even Mrs. Blemmerton had&#xD;
her good and evil "signs."   When her right ear&#xD;
"burnt," 'some one, she doubted not, was talking good&#xD;
of her; had it been the left, the reverse would have&#xD;
been the case. But the "sign" signally failed in the&#xD;
fashionable saloon : "ignorance is bliss," sometimes.&#xD;
We knew a neighborhood in our young days, in which&#xD;
an old hag held sway, to such an extent, that she was&#xD;
consulted on almost all difficult diseases, and on rob-&#xD;
beries, love affairs, and sundry other matters. Her&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
407&#xD;
&#xD;
house was a thoroughfare, day and night, for the citi-&#xD;
zens many miles around. If a hog was stolen, she was&#xD;
sure to be consulted ; and the sage answer would be,&#xD;
" It was carried away by land or water;" a very satis-&#xD;
factory answer indeed.&#xD;
All the colored race who were ^ trickeded" * had to&#xD;
" have the trick removed." Nor was this confined entire-&#xD;
ly to the ignorant and unlettered. Many, of whom&#xD;
better things might have been expected, had unbound-&#xD;
ed confidence in Tippy, and consulted her, as time and&#xD;
chance allowed, but always clandestinely, for they were&#xD;
ashamed to have it known!&#xD;
Not far from the city of  .-, a cove makes in -from&#xD;
the river, through a narrow inlet, which runs round the&#xD;
base of a high, craggy, rocky hill, and spreads out into&#xD;
a basin, somewhat in the shape of a horse-shoe,-a&#xD;
shape very apt in the philosophy of witchcraft. This&#xD;
sheet of water is entirely hid from the shore, by the&#xD;
hill round whose base the inlet flows. Were you to fol-&#xD;
low the inlet, however, you would find that it leads to&#xD;
a secluded sheet of water, hemmed in by rocky hills,&#xD;
on whose sides grow tall pines and oaks, whose branches&#xD;
sweep out over the cove, and, at almost all hours of the&#xD;
day, shut out the rays of the sun making it a dark&#xD;
dank, dreary, solemn-looking place, and altogether&#xD;
adapting it to the pretensions, incantations, and orgies&#xD;
of an old hag.&#xD;
R For the benefit of the reader who may be unlearned in such mat-&#xD;
ters, we state, that the colored race are very superstitious, and often&#xD;
fancy or pretend, that they are conjured by witches. This often occa-&#xD;
sions trouble ; they grow indolent, petulant, and turbulent; and noth-&#xD;
ing will answer, but a counter-conjurer to remove the "trick."&#xD;

At the period of which we write, one of these wretch-&#xD;
ed old pretenders and vile impostors had located her-&#xD;
self at the base of one of these hills, by the side of the&#xD;
cove, as a place adapted to her occupation. Her hovel&#xD;
was constructed of poles, brought together at the top, in&#xD;
the shape of a cone or pyramid, and covered over with&#xD;
dirt; and thither, as many of the citizens of  , or of&#xD;
any other part of the world, as chose to avail them-&#xD;
selves of the knowing deeds of old Hagar, wended&#xD;
their way, to consult her on their future destiny.&#xD;
Mr. Ben Slocum Sapientium, after taking it into his&#xD;
head, or having it put there, that it would be a kind-&#xD;
ness in him to marry Agnes Wallace, with all his tri-&#xD;
umphant Presbyterianism, could not resist the tempta-&#xD;
tion (indeed we know not that he estimated the great-&#xD;
ness of the sin, or thought of such a thing,) of consulting&#xD;
the far-famed old hag. Accordingly, on a drizzly, sombre&#xD;
day in October, Mr. Slocum might have been found at&#xD;
the door of the hovel of the hag, an opening formed by&#xD;
leaving a space uncovered between two poles. When&#xD;
Mr. Slocum approached, she was in the act of drawing&#xD;
a diminutive bucket from a mimic well, formed by&#xD;
planting a keg in the earth, before which she sat on an&#xD;
old stool. At her side was a stand, on which was&#xD;
placed a looking-glass facing the entrance to the hovel.&#xD;
This enabled her to see Mr. Slocum as he approached;&#xD;
and now, as he stands looking on in amazement, she,&#xD;
without appearing to notice him, goes on with her in-&#xD;
cantations:&#xD;
"Hocus-pocus in the well,&#xD;
I draw the water out ;&#xD;
Hocus-pocus will you tell,&#xD;
W's tc his younng man aout."+&#xD;
&#xD;
I ~&#xD;
&#xD;
" There, Sir," said she, turning to Ben, and scowling&#xD;
upon him, at the same time filling a glass with water&#xD;
from the bucket, "look into that water, Sir! What do&#xD;
you see ?"  "Nothing," says Ben, as pale as a sheet&#xD;
and trembling from head to foot. "See nothing, Sir?&#xD;
Your eyes want rubbing with the blue butter ;" saying&#xD;
which, she rubs something all over Ben's eyes. "What's&#xD;
see now, Sir ? Baby, I reckon ? Eh ? No, Sir, man ?&#xD;
No, Sir, girl I reckon? Eh ? Thought so."&#xD;
"I want to inquire about a girl, Madam," says&#xD;
Ben, doffing his hat, and growing wonderfully polite,&#xD;
as he wipes the sweat-drops from his brow. "Eh ? I&#xD;
knew it. Rich, eh ? I knew it. Chances, eh ? Want&#xD;
to know? Couldn't do without old Hagar. Thought so.&#xD;
'Hocus-pocus, tell me how,&#xD;
Sal, sal, olus cobus,&#xD;
I'm to give directions now,&#xD;
Fi, fa, habus nobus?'&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, I read it now; not easy, but may be made&#xD;
so. Yes : he's under his lucky star, takes lucky money."&#xD;
At this Ben startles, and begins to feel in his pockets.&#xD;
"Lucky money, Sir. Twenty round silver dollars for&#xD;
luck. Yes: that's it, as I read it; that's what the Ho-&#xD;
cus-pocus tells me."&#xD;
Poor Ben has not a silver dollar in his pocket.&#xD;
" Won't a twenty dollar note do ?" quoth Ben, wip-&#xD;
ing the perspiration from his pale brow.&#xD;
'"Hocus-pocus, will it do?&#xD;
Hocus-pocus, tell me true.'&#xD;
" Ah, yes: the lucky star is there. It'll do, Sir."&#xD;

THE BLEMMERTONS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Ben pays the twenty dollars.&#xD;
"Now, Sir, you are to put a long pole in your hat, in&#xD;
place of your head, and fasten to it a piece of fat bacon,&#xD;
and go out into the yard every night, holding it up high&#xD;
above your head, singing this song:&#xD;
'Leather-wing'd bat, come under my hat,&#xD;
I'll give you a piece of fat bacon,&#xD;
Come under my hat, leather-wing'd bat,&#xD;
And the girl I will have I reckon.'&#xD;
"And if a bat flies into the hat, then you are sure of&#xD;
carrying the day."&#xD;
Mr. Slocum returned home, wonderfully edified, and&#xD;
with a light heart. Never had he witnessed such wis-&#xD;
dom ; nor did he dream that old Ilagar was not mis-&#xD;
tress of all sciences. What sights he had seen. Lucky&#xD;
stars ; an old witch reading his destinies in a glass of&#xD;
water.&#xD;
Every night, for a month or more, found Mr. Slocum&#xD;
in his aunt's yard, dangling up his long pole, stuck in&#xD;
his hat. But he could never remember the charmed&#xD;
words of the hag; so he called aloud to the bat:&#xD;
" Batty, batty,&#xD;
Come under my hatty ;&#xD;
If you don't come soon,&#xD;
I'll go right home,&#xD;
And then you'll miss the bacon."&#xD;
At last, one night, after a long trial, whether Ben's&#xD;
wishes were the interpreter, or his eyes, sure enough a&#xD;
bat flew under his hat. That settled the question. Ben&#xD;
ran to his room, and commenced jumping his broom-&#xD;
stick again.&#xD;
&#xD;
410&#xD;
&#xD;
A few days after, Agnes, much to her surprise,&#xD;
received a sweet little note from him, handsomely done&#xD;
up in a beautiful and highly-scented envelope, modestly&#xD;
asking the privilege of paying his addresses to her.&#xD;
Bali! that was too much. Agnes was greatly amused&#xD;
with it, and handed it to Mr. Lovegood, as a curiosity.&#xD;
The puppy !" he exclaimed. Ah, Mr. Lovegood,&#xD;
take care !-" The puppy !" "Let me answer that, my&#xD;
daughter !" He did answer it.&#xD;
And here we draw the curtain. The Blemmertons&#xD;
were no more seen in St.   .'s church.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
CLOSING SCENES. PARTING CLOUDS. MERRY CHILDREN.&#xD;
AUTUMN and winter rolled away. Spring came with&#xD;
its singing-birds and flowers; March, April, Mr. Heart-&#xD;
ful has not yet returned. The days seem long and&#xD;
dreary, to more hearts than one. Mr. Lovegood is&#xD;
really getting nervous; he fears some accident has&#xD;
befallen Jonathan. And he half suspects Agnes of&#xD;
sharing in his suspense. She is at the Rectory, twice a&#xD;
day, but never asks a question on the subject.&#xD;
At last, about the middle of May, Mr. Ileartful&#xD;
touches the soil of his native land, takes a carriage, and&#xD;
drives first for the Rectory. 0, how his heart throbs,&#xD;
as he stands once more upon its threshold ; and in a&#xD;
moment more, he is greeted by his old friend and&#xD;
Pastor, and they embrace each other.&#xD;
But what changes a few years had wrought. Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Lovegood looked ten years older to him; his&#xD;
Pastor's head was already silvered over with age. But&#xD;
they were happy. And Agnes! Did he ask for her?&#xD;
Yes. "Is dear Agnes well? Is she happy ?"&#xD;
" Ah, Jonathan, boy, I know your secret," said Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood, rubbing his hands. "I reckon it's all right&#xD;
now. The dear girl was only misguided by her judg-&#xD;
ment, I think. I have convinced her of that. It is&#xD;
not that she thinks her fortune makes her any more&#xD;
worthy of you; or that it ought to make her any more&#xD;
&#xD;
estimable in the eyes of the world. It was all the result&#xD;
of an over-sensitiveness. She is older now, and is the&#xD;
same dear, modest, unassuming Agnes."&#xD;
Three days rolled away, and Mr. Heartful has not&#xD;
yet called to see Agnes; and once, when he was at the&#xD;
Rectory, she being ignorant that he was there, came in,&#xD;
but they did not meet ; for, when he heard her voice in&#xD;
the hall, much agitated he passed hastily into an&#xD;
adjoining room, and went out by a back door.&#xD;
On the fourth day after his arrival, a servant, in the&#xD;
morning, placed in the hands of Agnes a brief note.&#xD;
It read,-&#xD;
"Will dear Agnes indulge me with her company,&#xD;
this afternoon, over the same road that in days gone by&#xD;
we once passed so sadly ?                J. H."&#xD;
Agnes's heart now beat with new emotions. At the&#xD;
appointed hour, the carriage drove to her door; and she&#xD;
was in readiness. Never before had she appeared so&#xD;
lovely in his eyes. She stood before him the same lit-&#xD;
tle Agnes, whose mournful eye flashed on his under the&#xD;
dim-burning lamp; the same Agnes, whom, seven years&#xD;
before, he had blessed, when she left home for Mrs.&#xD;
Densmore's school; the same Agnes, to whom, two&#xD;
and a half years before, he had poured nut his heart,&#xD;
when she was humble and desolate; the same Agnes,&#xD;
who had magnanimously refused him her hand, if not&#xD;
her heart, when again, in his full tide of political glory,&#xD;
he had proffered it. There she stood before him, the&#xD;
wealthy heiress, the courted of fawning sycophants, the&#xD;
loved of the good and virtuous ; the same meek, gentle&#xD;

Christian, that she had always been; her radiant coun-&#xD;
tenance bespeaking the calm joys of her heart, now the&#xD;
full-grown, matured woman; her dark, lustrous eyes&#xD;
flashing upon him; her auburn ringlets falling over her&#xD;
well-formed shoulders.&#xD;
And he, too, how changed ! Two and a half years&#xD;
abroad had brought to him their changes; but all for&#xD;
the better. He was now in the thirty-sixth year of his&#xD;
age; and, in his absence, he had grown larger and&#xD;
fairer. In personal attractiveness, also, though always&#xD;
handsome, he had greatly improved. They stood gazing&#xD;
upon each other a moment, as if deprived of speech and&#xD;
motion. At last, turning away his head, he pointed to&#xD;
the carriage; she approached; he took her hand; nei-&#xD;
ther spoke a word. Each heart was full. They had&#xD;
proceeded an hour, neither of them speaking a word;&#xD;
scarcely noticing even the beautiful scenery which on&#xD;
all sides greeted the eye. They then turned homeward.&#xD;
The setting sun was just declining, behind the tall hills&#xD;
that overhung the beautiful river which swept past the&#xD;
city. The heavens were bespangled with rosy-tinted&#xD;
clouds, painted by the sun's parting rays, which, reflect-&#xD;
ing far and near over heaven and earth, bathed every&#xD;
thing in beauty.&#xD;
"Agnes, may I call you dear Agnes ?"  No word&#xD;
was spoken in reply. Naught was heard but the heart's&#xD;
pulsations. "Yes: dear Agnes, is not this glorious sun-&#xD;
set to be a type of our future ?"&#xD;
.x   *    *    *    *    *    *     *%   *&#xD;
The clouds have all vanished. Our story is told.&#xD;
Agnes is living in her own home; and she and her pious&#xD;
husband are walking, hand in hand, and heart with heart,&#xD;

along the path of life. With thankfulness for all past&#xD;
mercies, morning and evening they bend the knee to-&#xD;
gether in prayer; and the little ones who prattle about&#xD;
the house, are "members of Christ, children of God,&#xD;
and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven;" and are&#xD;
taught, so soon as they are old enough to understand,&#xD;
what holy creatures they were made in baptism, what&#xD;
holy blessings and privileges were then bestowed upon&#xD;
them. The Church, too, finds in them true and liberal&#xD;
friends. The poor never call upon them in vain; their&#xD;
large fortune is devoted to liberal uses ; and the treas-&#xD;
ures of the Church are increased by their generous&#xD;
offerings.&#xD;
And now Mr. Heartful, in playful mood, often tells&#xD;
Agnes, that she was a naughty thing, to have treated&#xD;
him so badly. And then, pressing her to his bosom,&#xD;
and imprinting a kiss upon her pure forehead, he would&#xD;
say, "I love you three times the more for it. Thus I re-&#xD;
turn good for evil."&#xD;
So the Lord doth bless the true of heart.&#xD;
"Look at the generations of old, and see:&#xD;
Did ever any trust in the Lord and was confounded?&#xD;
Or did any abide in His fear, and was forsaken?&#xD;
Or whom did He ever despise that called upon Him."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
CONCLUSION.&#xD;
ONE of those terrible crises in the financial word swept&#xD;
Mr. John Blemmerton by the board, and wrecked his&#xD;
splendid fortune, reducing him almost to beggary, in&#xD;
his declining days.&#xD;
Of all his wealth, and years of luxury and ostentation,&#xD;
there scarcely remained to him enough to secure an&#xD;
humble cottage and ten acres of land, in the suburbs of&#xD;
the city; and here he and his wife spert the evening of&#xD;
their days in obscurity, raising vegetables for the market,&#xD;
and making butter, which one or the other of them took&#xD;
to town every morning in a mule-cart.&#xD;
Miss Julia Jasper, at the age of twenty-six, married&#xD;
Mr. Ben Slocum, who set himself up in a tobacco and&#xD;
candy shop. Miss Deliah Airmyth and Mr. Slopill,&#xD;
though never exactly satisfied with each other, kept up&#xD;
their engagement, till Mr. Blemmerton's magnificent&#xD;
failure, when, as Miss Deliah said, it was broken off by&#xD;
mutual consent, and she rejoiced all the days of her life&#xD;
in the cognomen of an "elderly young lady."&#xD;
Mr. Slopill cut his cards in another direction, but had&#xD;

related, and the withdrawal of the several malcontents,&#xD;
no more sorrows cast their shadow across the life of Mr.&#xD;
Lovegood. He and his wife, hand in hand, journeyed&#xD;
to the tomb, in a life of singular unity and devotion,-&#xD;
" In regions mild, of calm and serene air,&#xD;
Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot&#xD;
Which men call earth."&#xD;
The Pastor lived to see the children of Jonathan and&#xD;
Agnes growing up to maturity. He had no children of&#xD;
his own ; and these little prattlers were recognized as&#xD;
his grand-children. A loving spectacle it was, to see&#xD;
the old gentleman, in his declining days, enjoy the&#xD;
sports of these little innocents as they played "upon his&#xD;
knees."&#xD;
"Jonathan," he would say, "it makes me young&#xD;
again." And grandpa's stories about the birds, and the&#xD;
chickens, and the fox-hunts, and fishing, caused ll the&#xD;
little sparkling eyes to be riveted on him.&#xD;
But he has gone! The tall green grass waves over&#xD;
his grave. Jonathan and Agnes have removed many&#xD;
of his sanctified roses from Heartfulville, and planted&#xD;
them by his grave, in his church-yard, and these bloom&#xD;
above his narrow home, marking the spot to the passer-&#xD;
by, where the good man lies. And the little wrens play&#xD;
about their branches as of old; and the birds sing in&#xD;
the weeping-willow that bends sorrowfully over his&#xD;
grave.&#xD;
But, he is singing "the new song" of the Lamb, in&#xD;
the Paradise of God.&#xD;

And now, kind reader, who have journeyed with us&#xD;
thus far, if the moments that we have stolen from slum-&#xD;
ber, while you have been blessed with angel visitants,&#xD;
have contributed a gleam  of Hope or Joy to your&#xD;
heart, or taught you to shun the path of evil, or turned&#xD;
your heart or feet heavenward, to Him from whom all&#xD;
good gifts do come be the praise and glory. We lay&#xD;
our humble offering upon His altar, and beg His&#xD;
blessing upon it.&#xD;
And if you desire to know "where our sketch&#xD;
belongs ?" we answer "Nowhere in particular; every-&#xD;
where in general." Our whole aim has been to give&#xD;
sketches of character ; of life as it is. If we have at&#xD;
times bordered on the sentimental, we can only say, we&#xD;
have not aimed to be romantic, but true to real life.&#xD;
We know not that we have anywhere overshot the lines&#xD;
of life, as they run about us day by day. We have&#xD;
spent a few leisure hours with the past; sometimes on&#xD;
one picture, sometimes on another. We cannot say&#xD;
that we are satisfied with the performance, and there-&#xD;
fore shall not be disappointed if you are not. Life is a&#xD;
mingled picture of sunshine and cloud, calm and storm,&#xD;
spice and wormwood, sweet and bitter, flowers and&#xD;
withered leaves.&#xD;

DOTTINGS BY THE WAYSIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ah, we all have a treasure in the past. We love to&#xD;
meditate upon it. It opens the heart's fountains. It&#xD;
draws us away from earth. It sets us on our heaven-&#xD;
ward journey. The eye opens upon the landscape, and&#xD;
the sunlight paints it on the retina, as no painter can&#xD;
paint it on the canvas, drawing into so narrow a com-&#xD;
pass the most extended and beautiful view. To see the&#xD;
Lord's Prayer copied perfectly on the size of a (lime,&#xD;
is a rare sight, a beautiful piece of art; but, 0 what a&#xD;
canvas is the little eye, and what a painter the sun-&#xD;
lillt!&#xD;
And yet, how compares this with the light of other&#xD;
days, which prints upon the memory lines, ineffaceable,&#xD;
of all we have ever seen, or heard, or done? What&#xD;
was it but the land of the Almighty, that took from&#xD;
the eye, and the ear, and the thoughts, so many pic-&#xD;
tures of all that ever passed before us or within us in&#xD;
life, and traced them on the memory never to be blot-&#xD;
ted out.&#xD;
So it is, our young days come back to us as we&#xD;
pass down the vale of life. So it is, all the past will&#xD;
be revealed before us, in the pages of memory, in the,&#xD;
world to come. What a glowing palimpsest, as De&#xD;
Quincey writes, is the memory ! If we have assisted.&#xD;
you, reader, in. "unrolling some leaves" of your mem-&#xD;
ory, or in looking into the book of life, our work is&#xD;
done.&#xD;
Life runs in crooked paths here, there, everywhere,&#xD;
like the erratic volitations of the bird on the wing; and,&#xD;
not often like the busy bee, which, when freighted with&#xD;
his sweets, makes a straight line for his hive, nor de-&#xD;
viates from it, except for intervening objects, round&#xD;
&#xD;
423&#xD;
&#xD;
which he passes, and falls into the same straight line&#xD;
again, then wings his way onward, right on. So we&#xD;
have written, following the bird on the wing, because he&#xD;
is a type of life as it is.&#xD;
And here, with a grateful heart, we bid you FARE-&#xD;
WELL, joining in the song due from all flesh unto the&#xD;
Father, Redeemer, and Sanctifier of our spirits:&#xD;

HEART AND HOME TRUTHS. - By the Rev. R.&#xD;
UI1ITTNGIAM , JR. 12mno., 188 pages.    Price, 75 cents.&#xD;
Heart and Home Truths is the modest title of a work, in which will&#xD;
be found much more than the average of deep thought, and true ten-&#xD;
der feeling. From the contemplation of the most familiar features&#xD;
of natural things, the nature of Truth is beautifully illustrated, and&#xD;
the modes by which it is to be attained are shown to be in the closest&#xD;
analogy with the other works of Him, who hath composed in one&#xD;
Spirit, both the Book of Nature and the Book of Revelation. Its&#xD;
doctrinal tone is high and uncompromising, though altogether devoid&#xD;
of harshness; and the drapery of style is as rich with the embroidery&#xD;
of fancy and a glowing imagination, as the glorious face of nature it-&#xD;
self can make it. This unpretending work will make a way for the&#xD;
Truth in the minds of many, upon whom a more didactic manner&#xD;
would be thrown away.                   .    church Journal.&#xD;
THE END OF CONTROVERSY, CONTROVERTED.&#xD;
-B the Rlt. Rev. JOHN1 I. HoPKINs, D.D., Bishop of Ver-&#xD;
mont.   In two vols.  12no., 918 pages.      Price, $200.&#xD;
The well-known work of the Romish Bishop, Milner, entitled, "The&#xD;
End of Controversy," was recommended some years ago by the Romish&#xD;
Bishop Kenrick, to all our Bishops, as a book, the perusal of which&#xD;
would bring them into the Romish Church; a movement which he&#xD;
exhorted them to take soon, lest their people should all go before them,&#xD;
and leave them alone. That work is still extensively circulated&#xD;
throughout all this country, and many earnest Protestants have long&#xD;
desired a work which might be a popular as well as a conclusive&#xD;
reply. This want is now supplied. Milner is plausible, ingenious,&#xD;
bold, unscrupulous, and withal readable. The difficulty has been&#xD;
hitherto, not to answer the book-for that has been done again and&#xD;
again-but to answer it in such a way as would enable them to meet&#xD;
the enemy upon his own ground. The well-known familiarity of the&#xD;
Bishop of Vermont with every phase of the Romish controversy, his&#xD;
thorough learning, clear reasoning, and brilliant and effective style,&#xD;
have all contributed to make this one of the most successful of his&#xD;
contributions to the cause of Truth. And the present position of the&#xD;
controversy with Rome, and the keenness with which public attention&#xD;
is aroused to meet her terrible aggressions, will give occasion for the&#xD;
circulation of works like this, which, without ever compromising or&#xD;
ignoring the truth still remaining in the midst of corruption, yet,&#xD;
throughout, maintains the most vigorous and triumphant opposition&#xD;
to the errors of Rome.&#xD;

carefully examined, and the teaching of Inspiration is brought out&#xD;
fully by comparing text with text. The grace conferred in Baptism&#xD;
is conclusively proved, while at the same time it is clearly shown to&#xD;
be a different thing from conversion, with which it is often confounded.&#xD;
The peculiar responsibility of every baptized person, for the right&#xD;
use of the grace in this !Sacrament given, is earnestly pressed as one&#xD;
of the highest incitements to the Christian life.1 The general teach-&#xD;

vouchsafed me, awaken a fear amongst the faithful, to the awful con-&#xD;
sequences of a "Moth-eaten" Church. Christ has himself shown us&#xD;
the remedy. " His seed is in herself." May this be the day of His&#xD;
power, in which His people shall "be made willing" to see and to&#xD;

The Nightingale, or A Kind Act is Never Lost, is a pleasant little&#xD;
Tale, from the German of Christopher Schmid. The incidents are&#xD;
laid in the Russian war, forty years ago, and among the many warm&#xD;
sympathizers with Russia now abounding among us, this interesting&#xD;
little story will be welcomed with more than common zest. It is&#xD;
intended for children, and teaches a moral of the law of kindness-&#xD;
not by tagging the moral to the end of the story, but by making it&#xD;
*the living principle which gives life to the whole. It is handsomely&#xD;
gotten up, with several spirited wood-cuts, printed in tint.&#xD;

This is a beautiful story, from the German of Christoph Schmid,&#xD;

and was befriended by a great lady, and learned his trade, and came&#xD;
to affluence and power, and saved the life of the son of his benefac-&#xD;
tress. The moral is happily pointed, and the story, though simple in&#xD;
its plot, attracts great interest by its touches of sentiment and pathos.&#xD;

UNISON     OF   THE     LITURGY.       From   Advent to Ash-&#xD;

pages.                                        Price, $1.00.&#xD;
It is pleasing to see a mind which has been long given to the duties&#xD;
of a severe profession, turning thus for relief and diversion into the&#xD;
brighter field of theological literature. Mr. Gifford has already gained&#xD;
a distinction in New Jersey by several legal works, which have had&#xD;
the patronage of our Legislature, and now we have another volume&#xD;
from his pen, intended, as it were, for a dutiful offering to his&#xD;
Church.&#xD;
The design of the work is to unfold and illustrate the more pro&#xD;
found and un apparent excellencies of that most elaborate of all pro-&#xD;
ductions, the Episcopal Liturgy. Although there may be a difference&#xD;
of opinion as to the utility of this manual of devotional formularies,&#xD;
yet no one can fail to admire it as an testhetical composition. The&#xD;
manner in which it has been arranged and ordered is most strikingly&#xD;
beautiful. It is a frame filled with moveable pieces. On no two&#xD;
occasions of its use does it appear exactly alike, but constantly&#xD;
assunes new combinations with the progressive sentiment of the&#xD;
ecclesiastical year. These ever-changing portions within this unalter-&#xD;
able framework are wholly of a Scriptural character. For every&#xD;
Sunday, two chapters are selected from the Old Testament, and two&#xD;
from the New, called the " Lessons;" and two brief passages, chosen&#xD;
for their weighty and emphatic import, called the "Epistle" and the&#xD;
"Gospel," are appropriately prefixed by a comprehensive and leading&#xD;
prayer, whose substance has been gathered out of them, called the&#xD;
"Collect."  But this is not merely a superficial arrangement: an aim&#xD;
and a principle underlies it all. Every Sunday and Holy-day has an&#xD;
especial subject assigned to it, either doctrinal or preceptive, which&#xD;
runs through and dictates all these variations of the Service. Thus in&#xD;
every week the Scriptures are made, by these manifold citations from&#xD;
them, to cluster around some central thought and flash their light&#xD;

It is this which has furnished the design of Mr. Gifford's book.&#xD;
The Prayer-Book has had many commentators, all of whom have&#xD;
alluded to the nearly-inspired wisdom of those who put it together.&#xD;
The further they penetrate it the more the y seem to discover the&#xD;
long-forgotten ideal and matured plan ont of which it grew. The&#xD;

remarkable fact of an intentional unison of its apparently diverse&#xD;
parts, has only been partially observed, and it has been left to Mr.&#xD;
Gifford to discover and prove in every case the beautiful appositeness&#xD;
of all to one nucleus idea. This, under the heading of each Sunday,&#xD;
he distinctly sets forth, and then traces its radiations first through the&#xD;
Collect, then through the Epistle, then through the Gospel, then&#xD;
through all the Lessons, to its remoter scintillations in the Catech ism&#xD;
and the Articles of Religion.,&#xD;
Such is the fine conception around which the above work has&#xD;
grown. The service of each Sunday is analyzed and outlined-all the&#xD;
information that could be compressed into a small space is given, and&#xD;
a rich variety of association instantly suggested to the devout wor-&#xD;
shipper. Probably no one could have been found better fitted for&#xD;
such a task than Mr. Gifford, and his cultivated taste and wide range&#xD;
of study have been now so successfully called into requisition that&#xD;
we find here the thoughts and beauties of many different writers&#xD;
blended about his own design in a many-hued mosaic.&#xD;
It is at once a noble eulogy upon the Liturgy, and a practical standard&#xD;
guide to its use. In this latter, its real purpose, it most admirably&#xD;
succeeds. The moral or spirit of each day being fully set forth, the&#xD;
attention is sustained and devotion quickened by the new colors and&#xD;
the defined interest thus thrown over the Service as it proceeds. A&#xD;
Liturgy is liable to abuse if people may go blindly and desultorily&#xD;
through it, but here the clue of every recurring service is seized and&#xD;
industriously pursued for them. One prominent topic is seen to draw&#xD;
its line of light round all its parts, and bind them together as with&#xD;
a girdle of gold.&#xD;
We have been glad to devote more than usual space to the notice&#xD;
of this work, because it is the production of one of our townsmen.&#xD;
A few specimen pages appeared about a year ago, which received the&#xD;
approbation of many of the most distinguished men in the Episcopal&#xD;
Church, and the author, thus encouraged, has put forth the present&#xD;
handsome volume, designing to follow it by another, thus completing&#xD;
the circle of the year.               Newark Daily Advertistr.&#xD;
The work will do good in two ways: first, by furnishing valuable,&#xD;
practical matter for private reading and-instruction; and secondly,;&#xD;
by dissipating the mist which some writers have conjured up, in their&#xD;
effo-ts to show that the Prayer Book was a piece of patch-work,&#xD;
with an Arminian or a Popish Liturgy, and Calvinistic Articles ; than&#xD;
which, no fancy could be more foolish or futile. Calendar.&#xD;

SERMONS FOR THE TIMES. By the Rev. CHARLES&#xD;
KINGSLEY, Author of "Village Sermons," "Alton Locke,"&#xD;
&amp;amp;c.   12mo,, 360 pages.                     Price, 75 cents.&#xD;
These Sermons are Kingsley all over; deep, daring, dashing, pene.&#xD;
rating, vigorous. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&#xD;
It strikes us as being a kind of preaching that we want just nov&#xD;
-that it is indeed preaching "for the times;" in character with&#xD;
the times, and, therefore, adapted for the times: yet, not in any&#xD;
spirit of compromise with the world therein, but rather combating&#xD;
the spirit of the world with the Spirit of Christ, in a matter-of-&#xD;
fact way. We think, therefore, that the Clergy may find some use-&#xD;
ful hints in the pages of this volume, while the Laity may peruse&#xD;
them with practical advantage.                    Churchman.&#xD;
These are remarkable Sermons, as were those of his former volume.&#xD;
They are models of a plain and direct style, sparkling with forcible&#xD;
allusions and applications. They illustrate the teaching of our Cate-&#xD;
chism to a considerable extent, and often in the happiest manner,&#xD;
regarding it as a symbol of Catholic truth. They are worth reading&#xD;
for their-power and demonstrations of most important doctrines, little&#xD;
heeded in these times, when the Puritan and Sectarian.spirit seeks to&#xD;
prevail.                                  Banner of the Cross.&#xD;
This is a reprint of one of the most characteristic, if not one of the&#xD;
most extraordinary volumes of the day, which no one can read with-&#xD;
out interest, and few without profit. There is something striking, not&#xD;
to say startling, about everything the author says; and yet the lan-&#xD;
guage is so simple and appropriate, as to be perfectly intelligible to&#xD;
every one.                                          Calendar-&#xD;
A capital volume it is-his style seems to gain in directness, crisp-&#xD;
ness, vigor, and moment m, as he grows older. It is as clear as Eng-&#xD;
ish can be made. A healthy common sense rules throughout. * *&#xD;
*  *  * 4*In our day when muddy heads do so greatly abound, a.&#xD;
volume of such sturdy, pungent, powerful and illuminating Saxon, is&#xD;
of the highest worth.                         Church Journal.&#xD;
They are incomparable Sermons for Lay-reading.&#xD;

IMPRESSIONS OF ENGLAND. By the Rev. A. CLEVE-&#xD;
&#xD;
LAND COXE. 12mo., 340 pages.&#xD;
&#xD;
Price, l.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Rev. A. Cleveland Coxe has done a great favor to the early&#xD;
Subscribers of the Church Journal, by collecting and publishing in a&#xD;
volume, the Impressions of England, which were so prominent and&#xD;
popular a feature of our paper during nearly the first year of its&#xD;
existence. To those early subscribers of ours, nothing beyond the&#xD;
bare announcement of the publication need be said, to recal the vivid&#xD;
memory of those delightful letters. But, for the sake of the more&#xD;
than three thousand that have been added since, we would say, that&#xD;
the volume, as a whole, is even more attractive, than were the weekly&#xD;
instalments then so keenly enjoyed. Mr. Coxe's local knowledge of&#xD;
England, even before he landed on its shores, was extraordinary ; and&#xD;
it has enabled him to stock his pages with a richness, fulness and&#xD;
variety of allusion, which perpetually kindles new interest. His&#xD;
faculties of observation are more than commonly keen ; and his com-&#xD;
mand of language is equally graphic and rigorous. Singular good&#xD;
fortune seems to have attended him also. Lucky chances, such as&#xD;
common tourists may light on one or two, seem to have been showered&#xD;
on him at every turn. Incidents that have already become historic,&#xD;
are stamped, with freshest life, on every portion of the work. Again,&#xD;
as if before our eyes, Lord John Russell figures in the disgraceful and&#xD;
contemptible mad farce of the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill. Again we&#xD;
see the Iron Duke bowing in lowly worship in the Chapel Royal of&#xD;
St. James. Again we wander under the vast long-drawn, and diaphan-&#xD;
ous expanse of the Crystal Palace. Again we rove from Cathedrals&#xD;
to Churches, and Colleges, and ruined Abbeys, and sequestered ham-&#xD;
lets, and breathe the pure rural air of living England, yet scented&#xD;
with the rich aroma of a glorious past. The essential unity of the&#xD;
two nations is ever uppermost in Mr. Coxe's mind ; yet never, even in&#xD;
the Royal presence, does he forget his native Republicanism. His&#xD;
heart beats true and strong for the freedom and purity of the Reform-&#xD;
ation, and against the slavish corruptions of Rome; yet yearns,&#xD;
with deepest love, towards everything rightly belonging to our dear&#xD;
Mother the Church; and his trumpet rings out clear, with no uncer-&#xD;
tain note, against all who would mar her full proportion of "the&#xD;
beauty of holiness." In short, we are with the author, as it were&#xD;
personally, from the beginning to the end of the volume.: and when&#xD;
we lay it down, it is with an instinctive asking-" Shall we never&#xD;
travel with this charming companion again $"  Church Journal.&#xD;

IMPRESSIONS OF ENGLAND. By the Rev. A. CLEVE-&#xD;
LAND COXE.     12rn., 340 pages.                  Price, $1.&#xD;
American Churchmen will find this the most delightful account of&#xD;
a visit to our mother country and mother Church, that has ever&#xD;
appeared. It was made in an interesting and memorable year, 1851;&#xD;
and the reputation which had preceded the author as a poet, scholar,&#xD;
and clergyman, procured for him at once a peculiarly cordial recep-&#xD;
tion, and such an intimate access to the various phases of English&#xD;
society, as is rarely enjoyed by American travellers. Thus supplied&#xD;
with an unusual richness of material, he has produced a volume&#xD;
which will be read with universal interest and pleasure in both&#xD;
countries.                                Banner of the Cross.&#xD;
Though these sketches are descriptive of subjects with which we&#xD;
are all more or less familiar, yet it is both entertaining and instructive&#xD;
to trace the impressions received by a man of talent, education and&#xD;
refinement, who has avoided the common places of travel, and taken&#xD;
no delight in spying out the miseries of the land, but rather exhibited&#xD;
those phases of society, and higher points of English civilization,&#xD;
which give character and dignity to the English nation.&#xD;
Protestant Churchman.&#xD;
Books of travel and sojourn in England, have been so common,&#xD;
that we feel almost reluctant to take up a new work of this descrip-&#xD;
tion; but we were agreeably disappointed in the volume before us.&#xD;
Mr. Coxe went abroad with many advantages. A Clergyman of the&#xD;
Church of England, with no mean reputation as a Christian poet:&#xD;
with many old correspondents of clerical and social repute "in the&#xD;
land whither he went," and to whom, of course, he was accredited;&#xD;
and, moreover, with a determination not to be a one-sided observer,&#xD;
or a growling commentator; .with all these advantages, it is not sur-&#xD;
prising that he "enjoyed himself;" and that he does not hesitate to&#xD;
say so, on all occasions, and in the most enthusiastic terms.&#xD;
The K.nickerbocker Monthly Magazine.&#xD;
These agreeable sketches, which appeared originally in the columns&#xD;
of the New York Church Journal, are now presented to the readers&#xD;
in a revised and connected form.&#xD;
They do not embrace the tedious routine of "books of travel"-&#xD;
life at hotels, travelling in stage coaches or by rail, dimensions of&#xD;
public buildings, etc., etc.,-all of which have been given an hundred&#xD;
times before in every diversity of form,-but rather give us pictures&#xD;
of English society, customs, men, manners, and events, embracing, as&#xD;
the author justly claims, a connected history of Great'Britain for the&#xD;
year 1851, with readable sketches of many of its most prominent&#xD;
men-Whigs and Tories.                       Troy Dai4, Whigq.&#xD;

OU R   CHURCH      MUSIC.--A Book for Pastors and People.&#xD;
By RICHARD STORRS WILLIS.       12mo., 138 pages.5&#xD;
Price, 50 cents.&#xD;
The Church has a good right to look to Mr. Richard S. Willis, as&#xD;
being, perhaps, of all our youthful native musicians, the one of whom&#xD;
she may expect the most true hearted and efficient service. His train-&#xD;
ing, however scientific, has not been that which would qualify him&#xD;
the most readily for usefulness in this field: but there is an earnest&#xD;
devotion of spirit, a reaching forth after the deep and the true, a&#xD;
growing strength and manliness, exercised and made firm by a steady&#xD;
industry, which promise the best results. He has just issued a neat&#xD;
little volume on Our Church Music, a Book for Pastors and People,&#xD;
which is the best and most thoughtful practical essay that has for a&#xD;
long time appeared among us.                  Church Journal.&#xD;
Were it not for the copyright on this admirable book, we should&#xD;
be compelled to transfer large portions of itto our pages. As it is,&#xD;
we hope to give, hereafter, some specimens of it, and in the mean&#xD;
time, cordially recommend it for its interest and the usefulness of its&#xD;
suggestions.                               Episcopal Recorder.&#xD;
Many of the articles collected in this pleasant and thoughtful&#xD;
volume have been already published in our columns ; and we are glad&#xD;
to know that they have attracted that attention among our readers&#xD;
which they deserve. The series is now completed, by the addition of&#xD;
others, not so well adapted to a journal like this, because requiring&#xD;
diagrams, etc., to illustrate them, but harmonious with those in tone&#xD;
and teaching, and equally rich in useful suggestions. Mr. Willis has&#xD;
brought the finest musical cultivation of Europe to assist him in his&#xD;
task, but has never allowed his artistic taste and knowledge to over-&#xD;
lay and smother his native good sense, or his instinctive perception&#xD;
of what is demanded in true church music. We have found his&#xD;
writings on this subject instructive and quickening; the more so, per-&#xD;
haps, because our own half-formed thoughts have often been brought&#xD;
back to us by him, more fully and clearly expressed than they had&#xD;
been to ourselves, and clothed with the authority that belongs to one&#xD;
who is so rapidly becoming a recognised Master in his chosen depart--&#xD;
ment.                                            Independent.&#xD;

OUR    CHURCH      MUSIC.--A    Book for Pastors and People.&#xD;
By- RICHARD STORRS WILLIS. 1 2o., 138 pdges.&#xD;
Price, 50 cents.&#xD;
Mr. Willis in this work considers church music mainly as a part of&#xD;
worship, which is its true and original design, and not as a mere en-&#xD;
tertainment interposed between the graver offices of devotion and in-&#xD;
struction. He points out the objections to the common modes of conduct&#xD;
ing church music, stating them with a good deal of force and vivacity.&#xD;
* *  *  Mr. Willis thinks that to make our music what it ought&#xD;
to be, " we need to simplify the congregational style and amplify the&#xD;
choir style." He gives some practical suggestions, well worthy of&#xD;
consideration, respecting the singing of children in churches, the&#xD;
position of the choir and organ, the importance of clergymen possess-&#xD;
ing s&amp;amp;ome knowledge of music as an art, and the training of the youth&#xD;
of a congregation in singing. In a second part of his treatise, Mr.&#xD;
Willis considers what subjects are proper for hymns, the adaptation&#xD;
of hymns to music, the treatment of words, the expression given to&#xD;
them in singing, and the introduction of what he calls "secular&#xD;
efforts" in church music. His views on all these subjects bear witness&#xD;
to his fine taste and careful study of the subject. Mr. Willis has&#xD;
given to both the scientific and practical part of music the study of&#xD;
years, and is entitled to speak on the subject with a tone of decision.&#xD;
New York Evening Post.&#xD;
The author is possessed of a profound scientific musical education,&#xD;
perfected in the best schools in Europe. Since his return home he'&#xD;
has been engaged in editing the Musical World, a paper which has&#xD;
done more than all other publications together to diffuse and popu-&#xD;
larize a correct musical taste in this country. His journal is not con-&#xD;
fined, however, to musical criticism, but comprehends also every other&#xD;
branch of the Fine Arts, and is characterized by candid and intelligent&#xD;
exposition and elegant discussion. Mr. Willis has given much atten-&#xD;
tion to Church Music, and the just views so ably and earnestly&#xD;
enforced in the Musical World, are beginning to produce a practical&#xD;
impression that exhibits itself extensively in improvements introduced&#xD;
into that department of public worship. These he has embodied into&#xD;
a volume bearing the title "Our Church Music: a book for Pastors&#xD;
-and People." It is full of interest to the pastor, the choir, and the&#xD;
congregation.                   New York Journal of Comnmerce.&#xD;

OUR    CHURCH      MUSIC.-A Book for Pastors and People.&#xD;
By RICHARD STORRs WILLIS. l2no., 138 pages.&#xD;
Price, 50 cents.&#xD;
If Dana &amp;amp; Co. can always find as good books to publish as this and&#xD;
the Rev. Mr. Coxe's, noticed last week, we think they will not fail of&#xD;
readers or purchasers. For our own part, we are free to confess that&#xD;
we rarely meet with a book that pleases us so well as this about Church&#xD;
Music. It is characterised by a thorough knowledge of the subject, a&#xD;
nice appreciation of the fitness of things, if not by a deep religious&#xD;
feeling-all ruled and governed by sound common sense. The perusal&#xD;
of this work will be useful to all, and instructive to the mass of&#xD;
readers. Clergymen, Choristers, Choirs, and Congregations, are all&#xD;
instructed, guided and assisted in their several relations to the musical&#xD;
worship of the Church. We commend it to the popularity it so richly&#xD;
deserves.                                           Calendar.&#xD;
Could every clergyman, every church warden and vestryman, every&#xD;
deacon and every elder, every chorister and every organist, in fact,&#xD;
every worshipper in every church in the laid, be induced to read this&#xD;
book thoughtfully and act on it sensibly when it is read, a much&#xD;
needed reform in our Church Music would soon be begun and com-&#xD;
pleted. Mr. Willis opens his subject by taking his reader into a now-&#xD;
a-day church and showing him-what is too true-that with a very&#xD;
few exceptions, no one of those present during the musical acts of de-&#xD;
votion, is really and at heart engaged in them; and the problem&#xD;
which he proposes to himself, and succeeds in solving, is, how every&#xD;
person in every congregation may be made, during the singing, an in-&#xD;
telligent worshipper. This he does in the course of an examination&#xD;
of the different styles of singing, of conducting choirs and placing&#xD;
organs and choir galleries, and above all, by submitting the versified&#xD;
Psalms and Hymns in general use, to a searching and most destructive&#xD;
criticism. He maintains, and with a union of resthetic discrimina-&#xD;
tion and common sense, which is invincible, that most of these from&#xD;
their unemotional character, are absolutely worthless for the purpose&#xD;
of worship, and entirely unfitted to music as the vehicle of expression.&#xD;
Rarely do good taste, culture, sound judgment and independence ap.&#xD;
pear so blent as in the pages of this little volume, the literary merit&#xD;
of which is not the least of its claims upon attention; it abounds in&#xD;
true philosophical criticisms of both music and mn. Those wh~o&#xD;
control our Church Music must either conform to the views set forth&#xD;
by Mr. Willis. or go on in blind, or open-eyed irreverence and absurdity.&#xD;
