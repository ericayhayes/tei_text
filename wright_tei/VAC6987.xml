as to behire it' false lights helix out by the&#xD;

the neat and resp{ictable appearance which&#xD;
we have described.&#xD;
lit to the scene with which we opened&#xD;
this chapter. and excuse the  digression.&#xD;
Twice or 1r'  did the old gentleman pass&#xD;
the door of the Exchange office which stands&#xD;
at the corner of Broadway atid -  street&#xD;
and nervously look to see that there were&#xD;
no eunit)mers within.  What could he, such&#xD;
a well known and respectable citizen, fear&#xD;
from the world's observation. Surely he&#xD;
could not do wrong to enter anit "Exchange&#xD;

Good morning Mr. M." he says- ' a&#xD;
lovely lay for the promenade-fine, very r"&#xD;
Yes Sir-the day is charming-I hope&#xD;
your health is in a good condition 1" re-&#xD;
&#xD;
plies the old gentleman with slow and dig-&#xD;
nified tones.  Then taking a large old-&#xD;
fashioned  leathern pocket-hook from an&#xD;
inside breast pocket-lie took from it some&#xD;
papers, then laying them down, he took&#xD;
from another pocket his spectacle case and&#xD;
adjusting the eye-assistantsupon his Roman&#xD;
nose, carefully examitncd the aforesaid&#xD;
papers.&#xD;
Mr. Greenly will you permit me to&#xD;
trouble you for a glance at the drawing&#xD;
which caine on last evening?"&#xD;
" Certainly Mr. M. here it is and the&#xD;
'hene'f or to day--a splendid chance.&#xD;
one prize of$4O,000-one of'  0,0OO-.three&#xD;
of' i1t,000-iand lots of little fish !"&#xD;
The old gentleman carefully looked over&#xD;
the drawn numbers of the day before, ex-&#xD;
ainied his tickets one by one and with a&#xD;
sigh laid them down again.&#xD;
All blank-all blank !" he said in a&#xD;
low sad tone, and shook his head, with an-&#xD;
other sigh.&#xD;
Better luck to-day, you drew a prize&#xD;
but a fe'v weeks ago, Mr. M." said the polite&#xD;
exchange brother.&#xD;
True-true !" but Mr. Greenly I have&#xD;
in my time draw nine hundred blanks&#xD;
where I have drawn one prize. I never&#xD;
drew but one large lrze, it was my first, 1&#xD;
wish to God it had been my last !"&#xD;
Ah my dear Sir, you blaspheme our&#xD;
good queen Fortune, if you talk that war&#xD;
she will never smile on you again--come&#xD;
try your luck to day-here is an unopened&#xD;
package--only twenty dollars !"&#xD;
" Twenty dollars-muttered the old gen-&#xD;
tleman to himself. Hettie entrusted num'&#xD;
with ten dollars to buy her a pair of satin&#xD;
slippers, gloves, and a laced handkerchief&#xD;

her money, but the drawing comes at four&#xD;

hack the twenty from a whole package&#xD;
and then there's the chance for the capital&#xD;
prize-I'll do it, yes I'll do it I'&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
In each chapter, so far, we have brought&#xD;
new characters before the reader, and we&#xD;
must do so until all our drameatis persona&#xD;
are introdiuced to their very numerous ac-&#xD;
uatintatces.&#xD;
The next scene we will lay in the front&#xD;
attic bed-room of a boarding house in Mur-&#xD;
ray street, not quite a dozen squares from&#xD;
liroadway. 'Thie room is fittedup as well as&#xD;
the la'dllady can alord. She only charges&#xD;
six dollars per week for the board of itstwo&#xD;
occupants, allowing them the use of her&#xD;
parlor to receive company in. This is very&#xD;
reasonable, and it ought to be, for they are&#xD;
two desolate old maids, and  that isn't&#xD;
their fault. Were they old bachelors, I&#xD;
would'nt ilanie her if she skinned their very&#xD;
"ye-teeth.&#xD;
One of these maiden ladies-Miss Aramin-&#xD;
tha Peony, the elder, is in the room. She&#xD;
acknowledges to being thirty she did so ten1&#xD;
years ago-but she has never gone beyond&#xD;
it-probably she ever will, although Mrs.&#xD;
lonnifess the landlady says, judging from&#xD;
her appetite, that she'll live a very long&#xD;
tim. ier cheeks, thanks be to Gouraud,t&#xD;
present a very healthy appearance-her hair&#xD;
is very thick, curls, and is glossy and soft t&#xD;
as that of a country belle who bathes hers in&#xD;
the morning dew. It would be wrong to say l&#xD;
that the celebrated Ciprico had anything toc&#xD;
ho in furnishing the roof of the upper story i&#xD;
of the tenement which we are describing, so h&#xD;
we are mum on that point. Her teeth are&#xD;
white as pearl. and regular as a christians&#xD;
daily walk. Castle, the great dentist, has&#xD;
seen and admired them. The lady was so s&#xD;
elated at his admiration that she actually&#xD;
presented him with fifty dollars as a testi-&#xD;
monial of her appreciation of his judgment. A&#xD;
&#xD;
Some envious woman went so far as to in-&#xD;
sinuate that she had seen the teeth before-&#xD;
but we don't believe they are anything but&#xD;
natural.&#xD;
Around the room on nails ruthlessly driv-&#xD;
en into the plastered wall, hung many dress-&#xD;
es-silks, satin and calico-of various cut&#xD;
and style, some of them more gaudy than&#xD;
true taste would justify, some of them sulli-&#xD;
ciently expensive to infer that the strings of&#xD;
a long purse had been drawn to effect the&#xD;
purchase. This, in comparison with the ap-&#xD;
parent scantiness of means which would in-&#xD;
duce ladies to lodge in an attic, seemed&#xD;
rather singular, but "singularities are" any-&#xD;
thing but singular now-a-days.&#xD;
A very small stove which would not hold&#xD;
more than a double hand-full of coal, warm-&#xD;
ed, or was intended to warm the room, and&#xD;
close up by it engaged in sewing up a rip in&#xD;
a tight gaiter-boot, sat the lady. Often she&#xD;
paused in her work and intently listened as&#xD;
if she expected some one.&#xD;
"I do wonder why Malvina Ann stays so&#xD;
long!" she said, impatiently. "The draw-&#xD;
ing must have come-if we don't get a prize&#xD;
this time, we'll be bothered dreadfully till&#xD;
we get our money next quarter-that is&#xD;
three weeks off yet. I can't do three weeks&#xD;
without money-we must have a little just&#xD;
to keep up appearances    Malvinamust,&#xD;
for that Mr. Townsend is worth catching,&#xD;
and he seems particularly smitten with her!&#xD;
Ah, that's her step, I'm sure it is-I hear it&#xD;
on the stairs, and she's singing ; oh, I know&#xD;
we've drawn a prize !"&#xD;
The door opened and Miss Malvina Ann.&#xD;
he youngest Miss Peony, entered the room.&#xD;
Snatching off her bonnet she threw it on the&#xD;
ow, narrow bed whilh stood in one corner&#xD;
of the room, and out of breath from hurry-&#xD;
ng up stairs and singing, sat down beside&#xD;
ier sister.&#xD;
"Well-the prize ?" asked the latter.&#xD;
"Oh let me get breath !" cried Malvina-&#xD;
then I'll tell you-luck has changed, we'll&#xD;
oon be up again n&#xD;
While she draws breath we'll glance at&#xD;
Malvina. She is five years younger than&#xD;
ramintha-and looks ten, at least. She&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
WE have seen Mr. Brent and his son-i,-&#xD;
law at home in their respective residences&#xD;
and we will now take a look at then in&#xD;
their counting room. It is near three, and&#xD;
their closing hour approaches, for in our&#xD;
wholesale houses little business is done af-&#xD;
ter banking hours are over. Charles is&#xD;
&#xD;
ielh. It's ix up ani go down-by the way, closing his cash account for the day, and&#xD;
I saw Wheeler to-day."                 with a self-satisfied air Mr. Brent is pacing&#xD;
"Wheler? oh, what did he say? He to and fro-over the carpeted rorm. He&#xD;
ant hii love to m., of course?''        looks as if he felt pleased with the opera-&#xD;
" o. iter!                          tions of the day.&#xD;
"Then what id he say ? come, don't.    Outside, the porter and two or three&#xD;
&#xD;
salesmen are busy arranging the store and&#xD;
ware-room for closing.&#xD;
"You and Mary were at the opera, last&#xD;
eight, you told me this moriling, did you&#xD;
iot, Charley?" asked Mr. Brent, after Bren&#xD;
non closed his cash hook and ledger, and&#xD;
locked them in the safe.&#xD;
"Yes, father-Mary is so fond of music,&#xD;
and I wish to do all I can to make her&#xD;
happy&#xD;
"You are a kind, good husband, Charley I&#xD;
You were at the theatre the night before,&#xD;
were you not -&#xD;
'.Yes father-we were at Burton's !"&#xD;
"These evening trips over to town must&#xD;
be very expensive, Charles, considering car-&#xD;
riage hire, tickets, et cetera, ci ?''&#xD;
'Rather, father, but Mary is fond ot&#xD;
amusement, and 1 tear shell get lonesome&#xD;
it is so recently that she has left home, you&#xD;
know' -"&#xD;
"-Poh, boy, she can never get lonesome&#xD;
in your little box of a cottage. I got hir&#xD;
one of Chickering's best pianos, andt well&#xD;
-ie knows how to use it. I'd rather hear&#xD;
her sing oe of those sweet English ballads&#xD;
bthai to listen to a thousand of your Italian&#xD;
operatic schire-chendoes. She has a ine&#xD;
guitar, and with you by her side, and books&#xD;
aini music, she can never he lonesome !"&#xD;
''e are very happy, father !"&#xD;
''Ion  t loit it. my boy, and I hope&#xD;
you'll always be so-but I like to see mar&#xD;
rid folks look for happiness at home rather&#xD;
than abroad. And Charley, I don't want&#xD;
to see you let your expenses go ahead of&#xD;
your salary, or scrimp you in your enjoy&#xD;
int at home. You have enough to live&#xD;
'otortably. on, but six or eight dollars a&#xD;
night on tariage hire and opera tickets wtill&#xD;
emipty your purse, my boy'-never go be-&#xD;
'yondtii your d epth, it has ruined many a good&#xD;
man! But take my advice as I mean it,&#xD;
my son, kindly. I must go to dinner, now&#xD;
-it is about closing time, give my love tot&#xD;
Mary, when you go over home; good day.&#xD;
my boy, good day !"&#xD;
"I wonder if he can suspect anything?"&#xD;
muttered Charles, after his father-in-law&#xD;
'departed  "lie must, or he wouldn't be so&#xD;
&#xD;
special and particular in his advice, it is&#xD;
true that I am going beyond depth, and if&#xD;
my luck doesn't change. God only knows&#xD;
when or where I shall touch bottom. There&#xD;
is that two hundred dollar acceptance comes&#xD;
due at ilinkel's in the morning. I must&#xD;
borrow it from the safe, and I dare not&#xD;
enter it on the books, for I've already over-&#xD;
drawi my salary, and the old man still&#xD;
keeps up his habit of looking at the books at&#xD;
the end of every month. I believe he'd do&#xD;
it if lie had the angel Gabrielfor a book-&#xD;
keeper. I'll borrow three hundred and pay&#xD;
ofl' my debt, and with the balance I'll tiy&#xD;
I)ame Fortune once mue. My very first&#xD;
ticket was a prize, that was a good omen-&#xD;
but all since have been blank. Bit heii&#xD;
wheel is ever turning. they say, it may turn&#xD;
me up a few thousands, and thenil 11 risk&#xD;
no more !"&#xD;
Brenuon unlocked the heavy door of the&#xD;
sate, and taking out a little drawer counted&#xD;
from a pile of' bills in it, the sum lie had&#xD;
mentioned. As he was about returning the&#xD;
drawer to its place he heard the door behind&#xD;
hin.open, and ste)s approaching. his face&#xD;
paled and his limbs shook witl agitation.&#xD;
lie was conscious of'wrong.&#xD;
"hallo, Mr. Brennon, busy yet? It's at&#xD;
ter three--thought I'd call in for a little&#xD;
chat 1''&#xD;
Brennon recognized the voice of his new-&#xD;
found but already (ilte intimate friend,&#xD;
Tullius CJatliii. lteco'veriug himself, he put&#xD;
in the drawer, and closing the door of the&#xD;
safe, turned to shako the extended hand of'&#xD;
his friend.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you," he said. "I was&#xD;
just thinking of you and that acceptance&#xD;
which comes due in the morning, on which&#xD;
you were so good as to become security. I&#xD;
have just taken out the money to pay it,&#xD;
I'll take it up early in the morning !"&#xD;
"Oh pshaw, imy boy, if it isn't the most&#xD;
convenient thing in the world for you, you&#xD;
needn't pay it nOw, I can  make old Ihink&#xD;

elegantly proportioned, lithe and graceful&#xD;
as the willow which sways to the breeze over&#xD;

lovelier girl than Constance Morley could&#xD;

were rather pale, and her long dark eye-&#xD;
lashes, as her eyes were cast down toward&#xD;
the sewing-work in her lap, cast their shad-&#xD;
ows on them, but the skin was transparent&#xD;
as wax. IIcr brow was high, her whole cast&#xD;
of countenance betokened intellect and re-&#xD;
finenent. The manner and appearance of&#xD;
her mother, for such was the relationship of&#xD;
the eiler lady, betokened the finished and&#xD;
well-bied lady. But the scanty, yet neat&#xD;
furniture of the room, betokened poverty.---&#xD;
The lithe cooking stove in the room, the bed&#xD;
in one corner with its snow-white counter-&#xD;
pane,t'he wash tub in another corner and sonic&#xD;

Of course he kissed the book.&#xD;
And though she took no oath, it is as cer-&#xD;
tain that she returned the kiss. In fact the&#xD;
oath was repeated several times, probably&#xD;
to make it the more binding. I like to ad-&#xD;
minister such oaths myself, they are never&#xD;
compulsory, nor subject to cross question-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
But a ring at the hall door bel startled&#xD;
the parties froin their occupation, and the&#xD;
servant announced Mr. Tullius Catlin. The&#xD;
brow of Mrs. Brennon clouded  Well might&#xD;
a shadow cross her sunny face-the serpent&#xD;
once more had entered Eden.&#xD;
Catliin bowed low to Mr. Brennon, as he&#xD;
entered--lower still was his inclination to&#xD;
the lady. Ie was dressed elegantly-not&#xD;
exactly beyond taste, but very richly. his&#xD;
garments were of the finest texture, the&#xD;
most exquisite fit and the latest fashion.&#xD;
The only jewelry which he exposed was a&#xD;
diamond pin of great value, in his worked&#xD;
scarf ; an immense ring of the same jewels&#xD;
on his linger, and a gold watch chain of the&#xD;
most curious fillagree workmanship.&#xD;
'Good evening Mrs. and Mr. Brennon !"&#xD;
he said as he entered. '1 am happy to see&#xD;
you looking so well. Having nothing on&#xD;
earth to dispel the care which ever clouds&#xD;
the heart of one who leads a solitary life, I&#xD;
thought I would accept your kind invitation&#xD;
and come over and sit an hour or so within&#xD;
your family circle ;" he said.&#xD;
"To whichJmyself and wife, most heartily&#xD;
welcome you l" said Brennon.&#xD;
"Certainly-pray be seated I" said Mrs.&#xD;
B. faintly.&#xD;
Mr. Catlin took a seat and appeared per-&#xD;
fectly at home. . But his practised eye had&#xD;
noted on his entrance that something was&#xD;
wrong. What it was, his wisdom could not&#xD;
lenetrate, but he determined to know be-&#xD;

night, for he felt a presentiment that it wait&#xD;
in some way connected with the game which&#xD;
he was playing.&#xD;

by way of starting a conversation.&#xD;

preciate the beauties of the Italian or Ger-&#xD;
man masters, over which our critics rave in&#xD;
raptures, or that I am very solemnly im-&#xD;
pressed with the nasal thunder of a thousand&#xD;
voices when they break forth in 'Green-&#xD;
land's icy mountains ;' but a sweet song,&#xD;
from a feeling heart, always finds an echo&#xD;
in my own. I love in a still moonlight&#xD;
night when wandering pensively by a lake-&#xD;
shore, in the shadow of trees whose leaves&#xD;
whisper back answers to the wooing of the&#xD;
breeze, to hear from afar off over the limpid&#xD;
water the rich, full breathings of the flute.&#xD;
That is music, is.it not, Mrs. Brennon ?"&#xD;
"It must be sweet'" said the lady, who&#xD;
unconsciously had been listening with ic-&#xD;
terest to every word he uttered.&#xD;
"Will you not favor us with a song ?-l&#xD;
observe that your piano is already open !"&#xD;
continued the visitor.&#xD;
"Pray sir, excuse me-mine may be a&#xD;
fashionable excuse for a young lady, but as&#xD;
I am a married one, you will believe me&#xD;
when I say that a cold really incapacitate&#xD;
me !"&#xD;
"Of course, I would not be so rude as to&#xD;
press you !"&#xD;
"Won't you take a glass of wine, Mr.&#xD;
Catlin ?" asked Brennon.&#xD;
"Thank you, no, my kind Sir-I seldont&#xD;
partake of wine except at meals !"&#xD;
"You smoke ?"&#xD;
".'ever ! I am free from that vice--o&#xD;
perhaps I am wrong, I should not call it a&#xD;
vice ; a 'bad habit,' would be abetter name !'&#xD;
"You was right in the first name, Mr.&#xD;
Catlin !" said Mrs. B. warmly. "I wish the&#xD;
Indian that first found the nasty weed in the&#xD;
woods had been poisoned upon it, and that&#xD;
Sir Walter Raleigh had drowned when he&#xD;

its use among civilized people !"&#xD;
"Ha ! ha! Mary becomes fiery over cigar&#xD;

"Enjoy ! Why my dear Charles, lid&#xD;

seated herself at the piano. 11er jewelled&#xD;
fingers ran like living gems over the ivory&#xD;
keys, and she evinced a skill that few of her&#xD;
sex could attain, in her execution of several&#xD;
pieces of the most ditticult nature. Science&#xD;
had finished for her what natural genius had&#xD;
commenced. Her father had spoken truly&#xD;
when he told his son-in-law that he had no&#xD;
need to go to operas or theatres to hear&#xD;
good music-he had it at home.&#xD;
Thus im conversation and in music the&#xD;
evening passed oil very agreeably.  Mr.&#xD;
Catlin used every endeavor to make himself&#xD;
agreeable, especially to the lady. His ideas&#xD;
were expressed in the most chaste ternis, his{&#xD;
principles seemed of the highest order.&#xD;
Even B3re'nnon who had only seen Catlin "in&#xD;
the rough as we may say, began to enter-&#xD;
tain a far higher etimate of him, much as&#xD;
he had thought of him before. lie had no&#xD;
idea he was so retried, so well inrormed-&#xD;
so much of a gentleman.&#xD;
And tio lady-she who had so disliked&#xD;
and dreaded d him? We can only say that&#xD;
much of her prejudice had vanished t&#xD;
It was quite late, between eleven and&#xD;
twelve, when Catlin rose to leave. Bren-&#xD;
non accompanied him to the door. Catlin&#xD;
had not forgotten the state of excitement in&#xD;
which he found Brennon when he came in,&#xD;
and as they stoo( on the little porch he said:&#xD;
"Charley, haven't you been in some&#xD;
-trouble to-day-if you have tell me, you&#xD;
know I'm your friend t"&#xD;
"Trouble, Catlin! What do you mean?&#xD;
You see I'm the happiest dog alive !"&#xD;
"I know you have every reason to be&#xD;
happy my dear boy-but mark me, I'm no&#xD;
wizard, but I can read a man's very soul by&#xD;
his looks. When I came in first, I noted&#xD;
that you had been deeply annoyed at some-&#xD;

&#xD;
ttSFORTUNE *, j1&#xD;
"You are right, I had !"&#xD;
"And that annoyance had also cast a&#xD;
shadow upon the face of your pure, good&#xD;

"Again you are right, it had&#xD;
"And as a friend, who in heart, hand, and&#xD;
purse is entirely at your service, may I not&#xD;
ask what that annoyance was&#xD;
"Yes. by Jove, Catlin, you are my friend,&#xD;
you shall know all ! She has discovered&#xD;
that I buy lottery tickets, her old fool&#xD;
father always made her think it a crime&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"How did she discover it?" asked Catlin,&#xD;
"By finding the package of tickets which&#xD;
I bought yesterday. I dropped them from&#xD;
my pocket this morning. I have promised&#xD;
her to buy no more!'&#xD;
"That is right--without these draw a&#xD;
prize! You know luck once in, don't&#xD;
change in a single turn. If you win a big&#xD;
prize in this drawings a $5000 set of dia-&#xD;

you the tickets?"&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
ANoTitEt character yet, in our Drama,&#xD;
and a strange, but a true one. But first&#xD;
well raise the curtami and look at the&#xD;
scenery in which he is 'bound to shine."&#xD;
Come up into the attic of one of the old-&#xD;
est cribs in Ann street. The furniture of&#xD;
the room is simple, even less expensive than&#xD;
cleanly. It consists of one old stool-a&#xD;
bench which looks greasy, as if it had been&#xD;
used for a table, and a small laying or gath-&#xD;
ering of old blankets and rags in one cor-&#xD;
&#xD;
ner, made up not exactly bed-like, but as&#xD;
something had slept there.&#xD;
There is an old auger-hole, or knot-hol&#xD;
in one end of the bench and therein is stue&#xD;
the remains of a tallow candle and close bf&#xD;
side it lays a piece of charcoal. We woul&#xD;
be puzzled to know thme use of that pieces&#xD;
charcoal, were it not that figures are marke&#xD;
heavily in black all over the once-white&#xD;
washed wall, evidently traced by the coa&#xD;
Scarce a spot on the four sides of the room&#xD;
or on the plastered ceiling above, that wa&#xD;
&amp;amp;       not covered. We will keep the reader ii&#xD;
the dark no longer. This was and is th&#xD;
room of&#xD;
a character well known to all the police&#xD;
dealers and many policy buyers of Nevw&#xD;
York.&#xD;
I have described his room and his furni&#xD;
tnre, and now will ring him in. Behold&#xD;
an individual of sixty, who looks full eighty&#xD;
His thin hairs are not grey or white-.-they)&#xD;
are a dirty yellow. Like the veterans o&#xD;
"76," there are very few left. His teeth&#xD;
having mostly taken leave of absence, have&#xD;
left his upper lip unsupported and it droops&#xD;
toward the nether, sympathetically. Him&#xD;
nose sees to be sharply looking after its&#xD;
friends below. But hiskeen grey eyes, like&#xD;
glow worms encastled in a skull, gleam out&#xD;
with a strange, strong light. his form is a&#xD;
study for an anatomist. It is that of a once&#xD;
handsome, appollonian figure, now reduced,&#xD;
not by the knife or scalpel, but by time and&#xD;
want, to "skin and bone."  A few ragged&#xD;
clothes conceal its interesting outlines from&#xD;
the man of science, but the Anatomical Mu-&#xD;
seum with all its boasted treasures, could&#xD;
not show a better specimen.&#xD;
Believe me reader, that man was once the&#xD;
central star of fashionable society-courted&#xD;
and admired-yes envied ! Talk of ro-&#xD;
mance and fiction-BEALITY beats it all. I&#xD;
am no novelist, I do not claim the name or&#xD;
the fictitious honor-I am a painter and I&#xD;

myself are in Evan's room. Hark, he en-&#xD;

k with wildly glaring eyes as he enters. He&#xD;
e- comes to the stool, sits down, pulls out his&#xD;
d old snuff box and takes a pinch of snuff.&#xD;
Df Then from a pocket of his ragged trowsers&#xD;
d he pulls out a piece of brown paper, care-&#xD;
fully unfolds it and---what do we see? A&#xD;

He took a pinch of snuff and then counted&#xD;

--he could scarcely see the numbers on the&#xD;
bills, so he lighted his candle in the bench.&#xD;

THE VICTIMS OF LOTTERY AND POLICY DEALERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
IN the eighth chapter of this story I intro-&#xD;
duced the reader to Constance Morley and&#xD;
her mother, and left them suddenly, as a&#xD;
knock at their door indicated a visitor.-&#xD;
Whe they heard the knock, Constance at&#xD;
once went to the door, and opened it. A&#xD;
gentlemanly dressed man stood upon the&#xD;
threshold, one who, in garb atnd in looks,&#xD;
did not resemble a robber or a ruflian. Miss&#xD;
Morley would at once have asked him to&#xD;
come in. but he spoke first.&#xD;
"Is this the residence of Mrs. Morley?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
t ii, Sir !" said Constance.&#xD;
"And your are-'&#xD;
"IIer daughter, Sir !"&#xD;
"Thie I am right; I called to see you on&#xD;
business !"&#xD;
"\Walk in and be seated, Sir-My mother,&#xD;
Sir-"&#xD;
"My service to you. Madam, my name is&#xD;
Catlin. I am in a heavy business down town,&#xD;
and having occasion for iiuch copying, and&#xD;
having heard that your daughter wrote rap-&#xD;
idly and well, I called to see if I could not&#xD;
engage leer as a letter-copyist !'*&#xD;
"Twould be better than sewing-how&#xD;
much can she earn 7 asked Mrs. M.&#xD;
'-I'm not particular in regard to compen-&#xD;
sation-if twenty dollars a week will remu-&#xD;
nerate her, I shall be happy to give it !"&#xD;
"Towenty dollars a week?" asked the old&#xD;
lady, scarcely believing her ears.&#xD;
"Yes, Madame, and more if she thinks&#xD;
after trying the labor that it is too little !"&#xD;
"Really, Sir, you are too generous!"&#xD;
"No. Madam-I have reasons for every-&#xD;
thing I do. Do not think me entirely dis-&#xD;
interested. The man who does a good&#xD;
u. Lion and says that his motives are wholly&#xD;
unselfish, tells an untruth. There is a ,no-&#xD;
tire at the bottom of everything. I have a&#xD;
motive. I knew your late husband. ie&#xD;
&#xD;
once did me afavor ! I have not forgotten&#xD;
it. It was only two or three days before&#xD;
his death. I but lately heard where you&#xD;
resided, and the first promptings of my&#xD;
heart were to call upon and see it I could&#xD;
serve you. I beg you not to think that it is&#xD;
only you whom I serve, for in the business&#xD;
I am in, your daughter's services as a copy-&#xD;
ist will be fully worth her salary, and I&#xD;
serve myself by engaging her !"&#xD;
"I fear I cannot fulfil the duties of the&#xD;
station, Sir !" said the young lady, timidly.&#xD;
"I have had'no experience&#xD;
"It requires none, only that you write a&#xD;
plain, legible hand. That you write an el-&#xD;
egant one, I can vouch&#xD;
"Ilow, Sir? You have never seen my hand&#xD;
writing '"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Constance, I saw   a note&#xD;
you once addressed to your father. It was&#xD;
written in pencil and evidently in a hurry,&#xD;
but he showed it to me and I admired it.-~&#xD;
This occurred only a few days before his&#xD;
al demisel0 !"&#xD;
The widows eyes filled with tears. The&#xD;
words of Catlin recalled the past. Tears&#xD;
were not strangers to her, however, and she&#xD;
treated them familiarly, she brushed themii&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Catlin did not remain long. While he&#xD;
was there, his conversation was free and&#xD;
friendly, even as if he had been an old ac-&#xD;
'guaintance, but in no way offensive. llrs.&#xD;
Morley was delighted with him-he seemed&#xD;
so kind, so alfable, so generous, and withal,&#xD;
so unostentatious.  Constance was pleased&#xD;
with his manner, yet intuitively she seemed&#xD;
to shrink from him. Yet when he gave her&#xD;
a card with his address upon it, she prom-&#xD;
ised to call on the morrow to arrange the&#xD;
preliminaries for entering up upon her du-&#xD;
ties as a copyist.&#xD;
Ile took his leave. As he walked from&#xD;
the door he muttercd-"She is fast in my&#xD;
net. I'll pay Morley for his last favor, now.&#xD;
I wish he could see me cancel the debt. Not&#xD;
two hours before he killed himself, he struck&#xD;
me in the face and called me thief! The&#xD;
blow burns yet-but he shall pay for it&#xD;
through those whom he has left behind.-&#xD;
&#xD;
Iv.was eleven o'clock when Catlin, after&#xD;
leaving Brennon's house in Brooklyn, ar-&#xD;
rived at Grab's rooms. Yet the last named&#xD;
gentleman was up. lie was occupied as&#xD;
usual in smoking a prime IIahana.   As&#xD;
usual, he occupied two chairs, his legs across&#xD;
one. No one but himself was in the room.&#xD;
"Ah, Tullius," he said, as our villain, for&#xD;
Tullius Catlin is the villain, not the hero of&#xD;
thisstory, entered-"I'm glad you have come&#xD;
in. 1 was getting go to-bed-atively inclin-&#xD;
ed, as my friend Willis says when he's&#xD;
sleepy."&#xD;
"I'm anythingbut sleepy just now-we've&#xD;
got business on hand. But for the mere acci-&#xD;
dent of a visit which I made to-night-to get&#xD;
a peep at a pretty woman, we might have&#xD;
lost the best pigeon in our trap!"&#xD;
"low so?"&#xD;
"You know about Brennon "&#xD;
"Yes, old Brent's son-in-law-he's ours&#xD;
safe enough!"&#xD;

closed the door, "I told you better times&#xD;

"The devil, you say !"&#xD;
"Yes, sure as shooting. You see I took&#xD;
a fancy to his wife, she is heavenly, the first&#xD;
time I saw her. I thought this evening&#xD;
I'd pay him a visit and study into her&#xD;
character a little so as to see how I might&#xD;
make my advances, for a woman is like a&#xD;
fortification, you must know something of&#xD;
its position and defences before you dare&#xD;
to venture an assault. Well, as I said be-&#xD;
fore, I went over-when I went in I saw&#xD;
that clouds had been hovering over the&#xD;
parties. Before I left him I found out the&#xD;
reason. She had found otit that he had&#xD;
been buying tickets, was horrified, a curtain&#xD;
lecture had ensued, her father having taught&#xD;
her that murder wasn't half so bad as buy-&#xD;
ing lottery tickets. He had promised of&#xD;
course to quit !".&#xD;
"How did she find it out?"&#xD;
"The fool dropped the last package he&#xD;
bought, in his bed-room, but I've got it&#xD;
from him and now the only way to hold on&#xD;
to him is to let him draw a prize from&#xD;
these numbers-at least a five thousand&#xD;
dollar go!"&#xD;
"Well, you can fix that, my boy. heave&#xD;
those matters to your judgment, entirely !''&#xD;
"You can rely on my working things up&#xD;
right, Sir! All that I want is capital and&#xD;
a carte blanche, and I'll make your firm&#xD;
equal the Rothschilds of Europe, in wealth,&#xD;
yet! We have more influence now, than&#xD;
any firm in America. We have judges in&#xD;
our power, we can buy the press-we can&#xD;
defy the law, yes, by making legislators we&#xD;
can make laws to suit ourselves. A few&#xD;
years more, Mr. Grab, of proper manage-&#xD;
ment, will give us the reins and we can&#xD;
reign as despotic as the Czar of Russia,&#xD;
rain showers of gold on our friends, and&#xD;
floods of trouble on our foes I"&#xD;
Ring down the curtain! The orchestra&#xD;
will please play the lemoncholy tune of&#xD;
'Old Uncle Nod," over the lamentable, sud-&#xD;
den and unexpected demise of this chapter.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was the next day. In a lottery office&#xD;
in Centre street stood quite a motley crowd,&#xD;
behind the "screen." Several of them wore&#xD;
black, some were women or had been once,&#xD;
before raggedness, rum and filth deprived&#xD;
them of woman's first right, that of being&#xD;
looked upon as the connecting link between&#xD;
the angels of heaven and we sublunary&#xD;
masculine humans. They were all listening&#xD;
to&#xD;
who for a'"consideration" offered to tell his&#xD;
dreams of the night before. Fifty cents&#xD;
apiece was the "consideration." One old&#xD;
negress who had but one eye-and had the&#xD;
white blotches of small pox on her scarred&#xD;
and ruin-bloated countenance, seemed most&#xD;
anxious to take advantage of his offer.&#xD;
"I wind seven dollars and a half off o'&#xD;
your las' dream, Mr. Evans," she said--"I'll&#xD;
try you again, here's your half, now whis-&#xD;
per me what's de gig to-day !"&#xD;
Evans bent down his mouth close to the&#xD;
ear of the hideous hag after he had received&#xD;
he coin, and whispered numbers. She left&#xD;
to buy a ticket at another ollice, for she&#xD;
didn't want any of her companions to know&#xD;
what her number was.&#xD;
One after another paid Evans for infor-&#xD;
mation as to what would be their luck that&#xD;
day, and it is needless to say that they im-&#xD;
plicitly believed him. He ofcourse helped&#xD;
the lottery and policy dealers, for the most&#xD;
of his credulous friends spent their last dime&#xD;
in purchasing tickets.&#xD;
*    *    *   *    *   s&#xD;
How was it with our friend Brennon-&#xD;
was he in "luck" that day. Yes, in good&#xD;
luck as far as mere winning was concern-&#xD;
ed, but in bad luck when we remember that&#xD;
he was allowed to win only that he might&#xD;
be led deeper into the snare of those who&#xD;
sought his ruin. It was about elevent or&#xD;
"lunch time" that Brennon as he promised,&#xD;
met his friend Catlin, at the "Shades."&#xD;
&#xD;
The face of the latter was flushed with tri&#xD;
umph.&#xD;
"I predicted you'd be in luck, Charley,'&#xD;
he said, "and I've not made a false prophe&#xD;
cy! You had the lucky numbers and havE&#xD;
drawn ten thousand dollars !"&#xD;
"Ten thousand dollars " gasped Bren&#xD;
non-"TEN T~lO~JAND~ DOLLARS? You'r&#xD;
joking!"&#xD;
"Does this look like a joke ?" said Catlin&#xD;
as he handed Brennon a roll of bank notes&#xD;
--"there is every cent with only the dis&#xD;
count off."&#xD;
"Well--you are a prophet, by Jove I&#xD;
didn't dream of this raood luck !"&#xD;
"What'll you do with the money?" asked&#xD;
Catlin&#xD;
"I hardly know-I've some old scores to&#xD;
pay !"&#xD;
Brennon blushed as he said that, for the&#xD;
"scores' he alluded to was the stolen money&#xD;
he had taken from his father-in-law's safe,&#xD;
which he was now about to return before&#xD;
his misconduct (crime I had better 'say,)&#xD;
had been discovered.&#xD;
"They don't amount to much, I expect !"&#xD;
said Catlin with assumed carelessness.&#xD;
"No, not a great deal ; about nine hund-&#xD;
red dollars 1"&#xD;
'Well then, after clearing them up, I'd&#xD;
advise you to buy your excellent and beau-&#xD;
tiful lady a full set of diamond jewelry.&#xD;
The ladies are always well pleased with such&#xD;
marks of attention from their husband!"&#xD;
"But Mr. Brent when he saw them on her&#xD;
would at once ask how I could afford such&#xD;
a purchase. Ie knows that I possess noth-&#xD;
Ing beyond my salary !"&#xD;
"Tell him that it is from the proceeds of&#xD;
a legacy left you by a relative !".&#xD;
"My wife who detests falsehood, would be&#xD;
present and hear me most likely and I&#xD;
should lose caste in her estimation. I've&#xD;
many faults Catlin, but I possess one virtue&#xD;
-I love her better than life!"&#xD;
"But she'd for give a 'white fib' when she&#xD;
gazed on the glittering gems !"&#xD;
"I fear that I should see gems brighter&#xD;
than them, tears glistening her eyes! Cat-&#xD;
lin, Ialmost wish I hadn't drawn this prize!"&#xD;

But if you don't want the money, go give it&#xD;
" to the first beggar you meet that can't speak&#xD;
- English. You'll find a dozen between here&#xD;

"Im not quite so much of a fool as that !&#xD;
- I'll keep the money, buy the jewelry and&#xD;

that?"&#xD;
"Poh---.when luck once turns in your fa-&#xD;
vor it is sure to continue for a while. You&#xD;
may win a fortune in a week-I'd not throw&#xD;
a fortune away on such chances as you have&#xD;
now !"&#xD;
"Well, I'll take your advice Catlin. I e&#xD;
know you are my friend, and now let us&#xD;
'smile.' I feel dry with so much money in&#xD;
my pocket!"&#xD;
S"I think most men feel dryest when they&#xD;
have none !" responded Catlin.&#xD;
While they "smile," reader, we'll sigh&#xD;
and travel into another chapter.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
ONCE more we'll take a glance at Mr.&#xD;
Grab's office. As usual the clerks are busy&#xD;
-not this time with their ledgers, but en-&#xD;
gaged in sealing and folding circulars.&#xD;
What were these circulars for and to whom&#xD;
directed? Judge- by each clerk having a&#xD;
directory before him of various towns ini&#xD;
this and other states. And the circulars&#xD;
were invitations to buy tickets, puffing the&#xD;
"schemes" &amp;amp;c. They were being directed,&#xD;
bushels of them at that, in defiance of our&#xD;
laws, to citizens whose names were found&#xD;
in the Directories, for the purpose of draw-&#xD;
ing more victims into the entangling meshes&#xD;
of the lottery net. Not a rail leaves our&#xD;
post office that does not contain thousands&#xD;
of these infamous missives, sent forth to de-&#xD;
coy the unwary. Beware of them. I have&#xD;
no doubt but that thousands of my readers&#xD;

within could observe even a greater display&#xD;
of luxury there. Paintings, if not quite&#xD;
delicate, of a far more voluptous orde&#xD;
adorned rits walls. The walls were n&#xD;
painted or papered, they were hung wit&#xD;
folds of pink satin which gave a mello&#xD;
rosy'light to the room. The curtains ov&#xD;
a couch in an alcove of the room were mad&#xD;
of gold-colored satin, deeply fringed wit&#xD;
lace. Everything else in the room corre&#xD;
ponded with this in richness.&#xD;

tion, because I wish to show what a letter&#xD;
dealer can afford, how a man who but a fe&#xD;
years since was a convicted thief, working&#xD;
his time out in prison, who has until lately&#xD;
lived literally "from hand to mouth," cat&#xD;
"rise in the world" by becoming an agent&#xD;
a useful agent in the heaviest and most in&#xD;
famous traffic in this city, lottery and police&#xD;
dealing.- My Tullius Catlin is no coinag&#xD;
of the brain, his wealth, shrewdness an&#xD;
talent in villany no picture of fiction-h&#xD;
is alive, in the city, and I am only giving&#xD;
the devil his due in every line I write about&#xD;
him. And I am doing it and this task&#xD;
exposing the Lottery League at a risk which&#xD;
few would care to undertake. A million&#xD;
of dollars capital, yes more, lays ready to&#xD;
be used to crush me. The assassin's hire,&#xD;
the lawyer's fee, the juror's bribe, the&#xD;
judge's temptation, the poisoner's reward&#xD;
are centred in the millions held by a few&#xD;
men, who in open defiance of our laws are&#xD;
ruining thousands of our citizens, robl/ng&#xD;
the poor and swindling the rich, making&#xD;
wreck of families, desolating once happy&#xD;
homes. dragging young clerks into the dun-&#xD;
geon, and breaking fond mother's, beloved&#xD;
sister's and confiding wive's heart's.&#xD;
But for the only reward which I ask, the&#xD;
satisfaction of exposing.villany and assist-&#xD;
ing virtue, I am content to run the risk.&#xD;
Life is not, never can be dear to me, and&#xD;
while I possess it I'll do my duty.&#xD;
But back to my story : I must get loose&#xD;
from the thread of my tale once in a while&#xD;
to stick my needle into the cursed creatures&#xD;
'       whom lam describing.&#xD;
Mr. Catlia had not long remained in his&#xD;
&#xD;
EITY AND POLICY DEALERS.              35&#xD;
tY elegant parlor or office, before a liveried&#xD;
sO servant, a negro as spruce as one of Mrs.&#xD;
r, Stowe's favorite heroes, entered and an-&#xD;
ot n9unced that Miss Morley was at the door&#xD;
h waiting an audience.&#xD;
W    "Ask the lady in !" said Mr. C.&#xD;
er   She entered, looking more beautiful by&#xD;
e far than on the two occasions when we have&#xD;
h before met her. Her cheeks flushed by cx-&#xD;
s- ercise in the open air, and probably too by&#xD;
her prospect of lucrative and honorable&#xD;
- employment, were like an opening rose-bud&#xD;
y -her dark-blue eyes were bright as the&#xD;
v ocean water when the sun rays dance over&#xD;
g it. IIer tall, elegant form appeared to ad-&#xD;
y vantage in the neat mourning dress which&#xD;
n she wore. 11er little black bonnet set far&#xD;
, enough back to reveal the faultless of her&#xD;
- lassie brow. And withal she looked ma;&#xD;
y jestically innocent. Oh how much true ma-&#xD;
e jesty there is in the innocence of a woman.&#xD;
i Even the heartless, brazen-faced libertine&#xD;
e shrinks abashed from it and flies to seek a&#xD;
suitable atmosphere in the presence of the&#xD;
t flower, which, when its innocence perished,&#xD;
f lost its fragrance.&#xD;
"I am most happy to see you Miss Mor-&#xD;
ley," said Catlin, bowing excessively low&#xD;
to the lady as he handed her to a chair. "I&#xD;
am also happy to see you so punctual to the&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
"I always keep my promise, Mr. Catlin,'&#xD;
she replied, "and never make a promise that&#xD;
I cannot keep !"&#xD;
"And therein you are superior to many&#xD;
of your sex-many of them make promises&#xD;
which they never intend to keep!"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir, such may be the case, but I&#xD;
hope such specimens are few and far be-&#xD;
tween?"&#xD;
"They may be, I do' pot acknowledge to&#xD;
much experience, for my business life allows&#xD;
me but very little -time to mingle in the&#xD;
society of ladies. Is your mother well ?"&#xD;
"Quite well, I thank you Sir. Can I&#xD;
commence the duties of the situation you&#xD;
have so kindly offered me, to-day ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Morley, but at first they will&#xD;
not be very arduous. I have only to request&#xD;
you to copy in my letter book three letters&#xD;

which must be sent South by this evening's&#xD;
mail. But ere I forget it, permit me to pay&#xD;
your week's salary in advance. Here are&#xD;
two eagles-"&#xD;
"Oh, Sir, really-"&#xD;
"Make no excuse Miss Morley--I remark-&#xD;
ed before as a friend to your late father, I&#xD;
felt a right to act like a friend to you."&#xD;
The young lady took the money without&#xD;
speaking. The emotion caused by the al-&#xD;
lusion to her father whom she hrd so much&#xD;
loved, was like a finger placed over her lips.&#xD;
Mr. S. then handed the letters to her&#xD;
which he wished copied, (which I need not&#xD;
tell you reader, without you are very green,&#xD;
were got up expressly for the occasion) and&#xD;
said&#xD;
"I am called out by business, and must&#xD;
be absent an hour or two. My housekeeper,&#xD;
Mrs. Caneouse, is out, but will be in shortly&#xD;
and may afford you company enough to&#xD;
keep you from being lonesome. She is a&#xD;
good, kind old lady, I look upon her almost&#xD;
as a nether! Though indeed I know not&#xD;
what a mother is, for mine died while yet I&#xD;
was a babe-my father also, and I have&#xD;
grown up in the life-field alone!"&#xD;
"I'm so sorry ! There is nothing in early&#xD;
life like a dear father and mother !"&#xD;
Constance uttered that sentence so feel-&#xD;
ingly, so naturally. so sweet, that anything&#xD;
less than a ruffian heart, case hardened in&#xD;
the forge of hell, by the hand of Satan him-&#xD;
self, must have felt the force of both tone&#xD;
and words.&#xD;
But Catlin, more hardened than the&#xD;
Arch Fiend himself, insensible to pity aslhe&#xD;
was to honor, felt not even the breath borne&#xD;
from the t sweet flower, by the gentle zep-&#xD;
hyrs of sympathy.&#xD;
lHe left the apartment. Did Constance at&#xD;
once sit down to her task of copying those&#xD;
letters? No. Woman from the time that&#xD;
Eve wanted to taste the forbidden fruit in&#xD;
the garden of Eden, has been afflicted with&#xD;
curiosity. She seems to take the disease&#xD;
naturally and never to care the price of a&#xD;
brass pin or a broken heart for the conse-&#xD;
quences. And our sweet Constance, like&#xD;
all pretty girls, had her share of it. (Ladies,&#xD;
&#xD;
MISFORTUNE! oR ,&#xD;
don't get mad at me, for you've not got a&#xD;
better friend in the world than Ned is, cruel-&#xD;
ly as a portion of your sex have treated me.)&#xD;
Constance, when Mr. Catlin left, took a&#xD;
look at all the pictures in the parlor, ex-&#xD;
amined the furniture &amp;amp;c.; not satisfied with&#xD;
this, she peeped into the inner room.&#xD;
"How rich he must be " she murmured.&#xD;
"And he is handsome-he is intelligent, he&#xD;
dresses well !" she added.&#xD;
Did not Catlin understand woman-nature&#xD;
when he left her there alone. IIe did and&#xD;
the first seeds of his design were already&#xD;
sowed in her pure young heart. lie had&#xD;
excited the two first of the three most&#xD;
dangerous parts in the composition of a&#xD;
woman. First her s/mpnathy, next her ad-&#xD;
miration.  The other dangerous part is&#xD;
love ! Why so?  Because though it is the&#xD;
father of happiness, it is the step-mother of&#xD;
jealousy. But I don't know enough of the&#xD;
subject to philosophise on love, so I'll quit.&#xD;
Constance, after her brief survey, seated&#xD;
herself at the table and commenced copy-&#xD;
ing the letters. She had nearly finished the&#xD;
task, when the door opened, and an elderly&#xD;
lady, plainly and neatly attired, entered the&#xD;
room. Constance was pleased with her first&#xD;
look at the lady, she looked so kind and&#xD;
amiable.&#xD;
The latter spoke first&#xD;
"You are the young lady, Miss, that Mr.&#xD;
Catlin has employed as a writer?"&#xD;
"Yes Madam?"&#xD;
"I'm glad to see you, he speaks so highly&#xD;
of you and your mother! I am his house-&#xD;
keeper-after you are done writing, I hope&#xD;
you will come down in my room and have&#xD;
a friendly chat with me, I'm quite lone-&#xD;
some !"&#xD;
"I will with pleasure, Madam. Have you&#xD;
been long with Mr. Catlin V"&#xD;
"Yes, for many years. Ie is a kind good&#xD;
young man, and so moral in his principles!"&#xD;
"'It is strange that he don't get married !"&#xD;
said Constance.&#xD;
"So it is, but I've often heard him say he&#xD;
would never give his hand where his heart&#xD;
could not accompany it !" replied Mrs.&#xD;
Caneouse. "Yes," she added, "and I've&#xD;
&#xD;
heard him say that he'd rather marry a gir&#xD;
who had not a cent in the world or a second&#xD;
dress in her wardrobe, if she loved him, than&#xD;
an heiress who did rot !"&#xD;
Reader, I'm getting tired of this chapter&#xD;
we'll let the women have their talk out, by&#xD;
therniselves, and go elsewlire for amuse&#xD;
meant.&#xD;

CIIAPTER XX&#xD;
Mn. ANTHON was down in the kitchen&#xD;
smoking his pipe, close in the chimney cor-&#xD;
ne. It was a vulgar practice for a weal-&#xD;
thy merchant, but he could afford it. And&#xD;
Le did it decently, for he wasn't smoking&#xD;
in the parlor.&#xD;
Mrs. Deborah was seated with her knit-&#xD;
ting work in the other corner. In the par-&#xD;
lor above were the M'sses Eugenia and&#xD;
Lydia. They were not alone. Mr. Augus-&#xD;
tus Vanroy, Mr. Anthon's new partner, was&#xD;
stated near Lydia; his friend Mr. Dennison&#xD;
w    'ated close by Eugenia. Now neither&#xD;
of he parties were unfriendly, yet each&#xD;
couple were seated in opposite corners of&#xD;
the room. And they were speaking low,&#xD;
in whispers-perhaps telling each others&#xD;
secrets. I'll let young folks guess what&#xD;
they were talking about and go and see the&#xD;
"old folks at home" in the kitchen.&#xD;
"Mrs. Deborah!" said Mr. Anthon, as he&#xD;
shook the ashes from his pipe and proceed-&#xD;
sd to refill it for the third time-&#xD;
"What do you think of the young folks&#xD;
up stairs?"&#xD;
Mrs. Deborah proceeded to raise her spec-&#xD;
tasles from her nose, that she might see her&#xD;
master, and laying down her knittingwork,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"You know I 'ore the gals, they are good&#xD;

"Yes, fine girls-fine girls,but the young&#xD;
d men, what of them, eh ?"&#xD;
a "You want me to tell just what I think ?'&#xD;
"Of course I do!"&#xD;
"Well, I like that Mr. Dennison, he seems&#xD;
to me like the bible, every varse you read&#xD;
- you can understand.  e is a proper nice&#xD;
young man. He speak plain out and haint&#xD;
got no manners like as if he thought he was&#xD;
above folks. And he looks folks right in&#xD;
the eye when he talks to 'em, just as if ho&#xD;
- wasn't afeard his eyes would call his tongue&#xD;
a liar when it spoke !"&#xD;
"But you don't speak of my partner, Mr.&#xD;
Vanroy!" said Mr. Anthon as he picked up&#xD;
a coal with a pair of tongs and lighted his&#xD;
pipe.&#xD;
"You want me to tell justwhat I think?"&#xD;
"Of course I do, go on!"&#xD;
"Wall now, don't be spunky about it Mr.&#xD;
Anthon, but I don't like him, and I'm sorry&#xD;
he's setting' up towards Miss Liddy, for I&#xD;
like the gal and I'm awful afeard he'll make&#xD;
her poor little heart ache yet. He speaks&#xD;
too soft, like as if he had grease and 'lasses&#xD;
in his mouth, and when he talks to anybody&#xD;
his eyes keep a journeyin' 'round the room.&#xD;
I like folks to look me right in the eyes&#xD;
when they talk to me. I'm afeard that fel-&#xD;
ler won't turn out no good !"&#xD;
"But Mrs. Deborah he has the best of re-&#xD;
commendations."      l&#xD;
"I don't keer for any recommendations,&#xD;
you asked me to tell you just what I think-&#xD;
ed, and what I thinked I've said. I know,-&#xD;
as my cousin Deacon Grant says, of himself,&#xD;
that I'm a. poor weak sepulchre of clay&#xD;
and prone to go astray as I travel on the&#xD;

"Ah there's a ring at the door bell-go&#xD;
up and see who is there ?"&#xD;
"The old lady lowered her spectacles up-&#xD;
on the well-worn saddle of her nose, laid&#xD;
down her knitting work and travelhid.&#xD;
In a moment she returned. She had a&#xD;

"A woman Y" said Mr. Anthon in surprise.&#xD;
ie was not in the habit of being bothered&#xD;
by notes from ladies. (Now don't get mad&#xD;
at me about that word "bother," ladies.)&#xD;
"Yes," said Mrs Deborah, 'a female cree-&#xD;
ter I think, 'cause she had a frock and bon-&#xD;
net on. I couldn't see her face, she had her&#xD;
veil down I She jist said-' Does Mr. An-&#xD;
thon live here?' I said 'Yes m'm, he does!'&#xD;
Then she said 'Giye him this note,' and off&#xD;
she went. That's all!"&#xD;
Mr. Anthon opened the note. Its con-&#xD;
tents if not unpleasant, at least agitated&#xD;
him for he dropped his pipe on the hearth,&#xD;
where it was shivered into many pieces'&#xD;
"La, suz !" there you've smashed your&#xD;
pipe!" said Mrs. Deborah.&#xD;
1cr master still gazed with an agitated&#xD;
countenance upon the letter.&#xD;
"It can't be !" he muttered.&#xD;
"Yes you've drapped it at your feet !"&#xD;
continued the old lady.&#xD;
"I must go an- see him instantly?" mut-&#xD;
terel Mr. Authon again. not heeding Mrs.&#xD;
Deborah.&#xD;
"Want yer hat and overcoat and injun&#xD;
rubbers, I spouse , ef you're going' out ?"&#xD;
"I-mnot going out, woman-for the Lord's&#xD;
sake don't bother mc !" cried Mr. Anthon&#xD;
as with the open letter in his hand he left&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
"Marcy's sakes! My gracious! 'Woman,'&#xD;
he called me ! Not 'bother' him! What on&#xD;
the airth can be the matter. He's a goin'&#xD;

If he is I'll never speak to him aging! Ill&#xD;
find out, see ef I don't !"&#xD;
We'll leave Mrs. Deborah to her wonder-'&#xD;
ings and follow flr. Anthon to the parlor.&#xD;
When he went in he called to Vanroy.&#xD;
"Will you step here a moment, Mr. Van-&#xD;
roy-I have received a letter which con-&#xD;
cerns odr firm, and it requires our mutual&#xD;
attention I"&#xD;
The young man excused himself to the&#xD;
fair girl by whom he had been seated and&#xD;
stepped over to where Mr. Anthon was&#xD;
&#xD;
standing. The latter handed him the letter,&#xD;
open, narrowly scanning his countenance as&#xD;
he commenced reading it. For an instant&#xD;
a flush of anger flew like lightning over his&#xD;
face-then, he was calm as before, but he&#xD;
bit his lips till the blood ran.&#xD;
"Mr. Anthon !"said he in a low tone, "this&#xD;
is the work of some infamous secret enemy.&#xD;
The charge is false-tell me how it came&#xD;
into your hands ?"&#xD;
"A veiled female left it here a few min-&#xD;
utes since !"&#xD;
"Some creature hired by an enemy who&#xD;
either envies me my good fortune, or whom&#xD;
I have offended-some would-be rival either&#xD;
in my love or prosperity !"&#xD;
"But who could you have offended here?&#xD;
Lydia never has received marked attentions&#xD;
from any one else !"&#xD;
"True Sir. there is some mystery wnich I&#xD;
cannot unravel. But rest assured that the&#xD;
charge is false. I am no deceiver-you&#xD;
have vouchers for my character which no&#xD;
man can doubt-pray let me look elosely at&#xD;
this letter, let me keep it till morning, I&#xD;
may discover a clue to the hand-writing&#xD;
from among letters from my many corres-&#xD;
pondents-oh that I could find the origina-&#xD;
tor of so base a trick !"&#xD;
"Keep the letter till morning!" said Mr.&#xD;
Anthon-"bat I shall want it then, for I&#xD;
must be satisfied in this matter !"&#xD;
"You shall have it, Sir ! I hope you'll&#xD;
not mention the matter to anybody else !"&#xD;
"Certainly not-certainly not, I hope all&#xD;
will he right !"&#xD;
Mr. Anthon returned to the kitchen to fill&#xD;
another pipe and to ponder.&#xD;
Vanroy returned to the side of Lydia-&#xD;
only to announce that sudden business call-&#xD;
ed him out and then turned to excuse him-&#xD;
self to Dennison and the other lady.&#xD;
"It must be important business to call you&#xD;
from us at such an early hour!" said Miss&#xD;
Eugenia.&#xD;
"It is, I regret to say !"&#xD;
"Then, perhaps I may be of service let&#xD;

bowed low to the ladies,              hopes of fortune all embraced within the&#xD;
"Certainly !" said Lydia. "It is a motto circle of her love and my connection with&#xD;
&#xD;
of our dear father, that business should al-&#xD;
ways take the precedence of pleasure!"&#xD;
The young men made their adieus, warm&#xD;
ones too, they seemed to be, and departed.&#xD;
"What business can call you out so sud-&#xD;
denly and so late ?" asked Dennison of his&#xD;
companion.&#xD;
"Something too important to neglect !&#xD;
You are aware that I have a mistress!"&#xD;
"Yes, but you told me that influenced by&#xD;
virtuous love you had cast her off! That&#xD;
for Lydia's sake, as I for that of my angelic&#xD;
Eugenia, you had cast aside your follies,&#xD;
sins I might as well call them ?"&#xD;
"So.I have, butt the vixen won't be cast&#xD;
off, without revenge; she has written to&#xD;
Anthon to-night !"&#xD;
"Did you not provide for her when you&#xD;
sent her away" -&#xD;
"Of course, I did, like a man and a gent-&#xD;
leman!"&#xD;
"What has she written to him?"&#xD;
"A letter which I have in my pocket,&#xD;
stating that she has heard that I am court-&#xD;
ing a protegee of his, and that if so she&#xD;
wishes to inform him that I am not only a&#xD;
villain and libertine, but am married al-&#xD;
ready, as he can be satisfied by having an&#xD;
interview with her, which if he wishes he&#xD;
can have by addressing her to the initials&#xD;
which she signs in the letter !"&#xD;
"Why Gus, this is a serious matter!"&#xD;
"'ll make it serious; before I'm done with&#xD;
it," muttered Vanroy to himself, then rais-&#xD;
ing his tone, he said: "Yes, Dennisony it is&#xD;
unpleasant. Can you advise me how to ar-&#xD;
range it ?"&#xD;
"Why, Gus, really I don't know what to'&#xD;
do, or what to say !"&#xD;
.      "Then my dear boy, the wisest thing is&#xD;
for you to do or say nothing ! Leave me&#xD;

Mr. Anthon Y"&#xD;
"Yes, yes! Forgive me Gus, if an un-&#xD;
worthy suspicion ever crossed my mind for&#xD;
an instant I"&#xD;
"Oh'twas, 'tis nothing, Dennison-be as-&#xD;
sured that I'm all right ; now here at this&#xD;
corner we part until morning I"&#xD;
"Yes, good night-meet me at my lodg-&#xD;
ings at ten, for our visit to to our two little&#xD;

"Ten shall be the hour. .1u revoir?"&#xD;
Thus, for the night the two young men&#xD;
separated.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXL&#xD;
AUousvus VANaoY stood once more in his&#xD;
own room, and before him stood Laura, her&#xD;
whom I described in the eleventh chapter,&#xD;
his Heaen-wedded wife.&#xD;
Tell me not, that no marriage is binding&#xD;
save that which by some hollow-headed&#xD;
hireling in sacerdotal garb is performed, or&#xD;
that by some official who only knows his&#xD;
duty by the fee it allows, is done. That&#xD;
words uttered by one of these, and vows&#xD;
made before witnesses who an hour thehce&#xD;
may be stricken down with death, alone&#xD;
render a marriage legal in the sight of Gen&#xD;
and unto rn acceptable !&#xD;
The vows made when a loving, confiding&#xD;
woman unto a man vows like her to be&#xD;
forevertrue and faithful, are as binding in&#xD;
the eye of God, as those uttered before a&#xD;
multitude, for ME is the witness, nIE who is&#xD;
ALL JUST-ALL POWERFUL !&#xD;
It is true that Augustus Vanroy was not&#xD;
married to Laura according to the form pre-&#xD;
scribed by mon, yet not the less was she his&#xD;

wife in the eight of God. There in its little&#xD;
criblay the sweet pledge which the Almighty&#xD;
had given them as a proof of their marriage&#xD;
-their innocent, beautiful boy. And base,&#xD;
inhumanly heartless would be he who would&#xD;
disown so binding a wedlock, desert so good&#xD;
a wife, so fair a child! Yet to do both of&#xD;
these did Augustus Vanroy seek.&#xD;
As I said (when I commenced this chap-&#xD;
ter,) he stood before Laura. The letter was&#xD;
in hi. hand. He was pale as a drift of snow.&#xD;
She was calm, as ealn as tue child which&#xD;
lay asleep in its crib near where she was&#xD;
standing. lie, too, was calm, but unnatur-&#xD;
ally so ; like the atmosphere just before a&#xD;
heavy storm breaks forth.&#xD;
"Laura, did you write this letter ?" he&#xD;
asked in a low tone, almost hoarse from his&#xD;
endeavor to choke his anger.&#xD;
"Yes, and delivered it, Gus !"&#xD;
"Fiends of hell t You acknowledge it&#xD;
then)"&#xD;
"I do!"&#xD;
"What did you mean by it? Why have&#xD;
you thus trampled upon my nearest inter-&#xD;
"Not hecanse I loved you, Gus ! That&#xD;
love, by your neglect and cruelty, has been&#xD;
almost crushed in my heart. I did it for&#xD;

which never had been born had you not&#xD;
promised to make it legitimate !"&#xD;
"Curse the  -"&#xD;
"Stop-stop Augustus Vanroy !    You&#xD;
may curse me, but you shall not curse our&#xD;
offspring ! I have watched you for weeks,&#xD;
and I know all. I not only know that you&#xD;
are trying to deceive and rob a good old&#xD;
man of his fortune, but also that you are&#xD;

in a sobbing tone, he said:&#xD;
"Laura, you are right, I have done wrong.&#xD;

sacrifice all to make you happy ; this very&#xD;

Long and earnestly did the woman scan&#xD;
his features before she spoke. He looked&#xD;
as earnestly as he spoke, but one who has&#xD;
been once deceived doubts forever there-&#xD;
after.&#xD;
"You do not mean what you say, Gus !"&#xD;
she said mournfully. "Once I would as&#xD;

the smallest word you uttered-now I can-&#xD;
not believe you. Oh Gus, how you have&#xD;

Tears started in her eyes when she said&#xD;
this.&#xD;

roy as with renewed energy he recommen-&#xD;

Up went the window once more and out&#xD;
came the head of the bearded Ishmael.&#xD;
"Tousand duyvels ! I tell you come to-&#xD;
morrow-what you want's ?"&#xD;
"I have a message from Tullius Catlin,&#xD;
for you t"&#xD;
The name seemed to sound like magic on&#xD;
the llebrew's ears.&#xD;

In a few moments the door was opened&#xD;
and Vanroy entered the house. After lock-&#xD;
ing the door behind him thy Jew turned and&#xD;
examined his visitor closely by the light of&#xD;
the tallow candle which he held in his hand.&#xD;
A strange looking creature was hhmael.&#xD;
A diminutive body, lean ani dried up, was&#xD;
capped by a very large head whichwas&#xD;
bald and shone like one of the polished&#xD;
skulls in Fowler's window. Ills little black&#xD;
eyes peered out from under a cliff of grey&#xD;
eyebrows-his features were as Jewish as&#xD;
Iscariot's, the skin of his face looked like a&#xD;
piece of smoked parchment, shrivelled into&#xD;
wrinkles by the tire. his dress was shabby&#xD;
and dirty.&#xD;
"So, Mishter-you pe come from Dullius&#xD;
Gatlin, eh vat rants my coot front?"&#xD;
"lie wants nothing, I want something, he&#xD;
told me if ever I needed aid, to come to you,&#xD;

The Jew started at the mention of the&#xD;
name. but replied :&#xD;
"Yesh, dat ish a coot word-Isuppose you&#xD;
aced monish. Dat I lends on coot security !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, I do not want money, I've more now&#xD;
than I know what to dowith I I want your&#xD;

The Jew's eyes snapped as he heard pay&#xD;
spoken of.&#xD;
"Vat can I do for you, Mishter?"&#xD;
"First I want a carriage and a driver who&#xD;
can be depended on to keep a secret !"&#xD;
"Dat can I get. Mine frent Cleeson keep&#xD;

a case of jewels.&#xD;
"Oh goodness, how brilliant, how beau-&#xD;

"Certainly-is it not a magnificent set.&#xD;

turquoise and diamond interspersed, and a&#xD;
pin-the whole se  is valued at $5000 !"&#xD;
"Indeed ! How brilliant will the lady&#xD;
that wears them appear when at a ball or&#xD;
evening party, she appearsin a well lighted&#xD;
room !"&#xD;
"She will indeed. She is very beautiful,&#xD;
but these ornaments will add to her beauty,&#xD;
queenly as she now is."&#xD;
"Do I know her ?"&#xD;
"Yes, quite intimately. You and her&#xD;
were school-girls together-she is married,&#xD;

x        "That I kissed her back, and told her that&#xD;
I loved her."&#xD;
"Charles this a cruel jest-you are only&#xD;

"I was never more serious in my life,.&#xD;
Mary-it is true-but now, now don't let a&#xD;
tear till your eyes. I'll show you the lady's&#xD;
portrait, if you won't cry !"&#xD;
"Well show it to me,.I want to see her."&#xD;
Mrs. Brennon's voice was not quite so&#xD;
kind and sweet as usual when she said this,&#xD;
and her face did not wear its ever-radiant'&#xD;
hue of gladness. But when her husband&#xD;
led her before the mirror and pointing to&#xD;
her the reflection of her own beautiful face,&#xD;
and kissing her fondly said, "that is the&#xD;
lady who kissed me, whom  I kissed in re-&#xD;
turn, and whom I love ;" she could not&#xD;
help smiling.&#xD;
T"ou cruel rogue," she said, "I didn't&#xD;
know what to make of you, you acted so&#xD;
seriously. But the jewels, who do they be-&#xD;
long to ?"&#xD;
"To you,,my own dear wife."&#xD;
"To me, Charles? Surely father cannot&#xD;
have made inc such a present ?"&#xD;
"No, he has never seen them. I bought&#xD;
them for you."&#xD;
"You, Charles? Why whereon earth did&#xD;
you get the money? You surely have not&#xD;
gone in debt to make me such a costly and&#xD;
unnecessary gift?"&#xD;
"No, I paid cash for them?"&#xD;
"Charles, please explain. There is some&#xD;
mystery in this."&#xD;
"None at all dear Mary-you remember&#xD;
the lottery tickets ?"&#xD;
"Yes and they-"&#xD;
"Drew a prize of ten thousand dollars for&#xD;
me. I have used a part of this money to&#xD;
k       buy these jewels which will so become youl"&#xD;
&#xD;
replied in a subdued, sad, but firm tone.&#xD;
"Never wear them, Mary? Why but now&#xD;
you admired them so much, and seemed to&#xD;
envy the lady who was to possess them."&#xD;
"I did, do still admire them ; they are&#xD;
very beautiful, but I repeat my husband,&#xD;
that I can never wear them."&#xD;
"'Why, dear Iarmy ?"&#xD;
" because they have been purchased by&#xD;
the proceeds of a wrong, an illegal specula-&#xD;
tion. I would not dare to look father in&#xD;
the face when I wore these."&#xD;
"But he need never know that they were&#xD;
the proceeds of a prize in the lottery."&#xD;
"He knows, Charles, the precise amount&#xD;
of your salary-lhe also knows that you&#xD;
have no other means. How could you ac-&#xD;
count for so rich, so extravagant a pur-&#xD;
chase "&#xD;
"Why tell him a distant relative has died&#xD;
and left me money. I mean to invest the&#xD;
rest in the business of the house if he will&#xD;
let me."&#xD;
"Charles, would you stoop to utter a&#xD;
falsehood ?"&#xD;
"Not exactly a wilful falsehood, my dear&#xD;
wife, but this would not be such. It is only&#xD;
a harmless deceit, a white fib, you know."&#xD;
"I know no difference in untruths,&#xD;
Charles. All are black to me. You know&#xD;
how I abhor deceit. You have changed if&#xD;
you do not."&#xD;
"I am not changed, Mary ; but I have&#xD;
this money. Fortune has smiled upon me&#xD;
and it would seem wrong to scorn favors so&#xD;
seldom bestowed."&#xD;
"I wish she had frowned, rather than&#xD;
smiled upon you, Charles-I would rather&#xD;
share a cot in poverty with you and labor&#xD;
by your'side, than live in a palace on means&#xD;
gained by such a way as this was. Charles,&#xD;
cannot you return the money ?"&#xD;
"Not when more than half of it is spent&#xD;
to buy for you this present!"&#xD;
"Will they not take back the jewels and&#xD;
refund the money ?"&#xD;
"No, dear Mary-it is a maxim in trade&#xD;
never to retract or back out from a good&#xD;
bargain. , They have the cash for the gems&#xD;

the jewel case, but he had no time to do so.&#xD;
Mr. Bri nt's eye fell upon them as they lay&#xD;
open on the table.&#xD;
"ey day, what have you got here. clil-&#xD;
dren ?" he said. "Why on my word they're&#xD;
brilliants! who do these costly gew-gaws&#xD;
belong to ?"&#xD;
Brennon was about to speak, but his&#xD;
wife pure as she was beautiful, and sensitive&#xD;
to his honor, spoke first.&#xD;
'My kind husband is trying to persuade!&#xD;
me to accept them dear, father!"&#xD;
"l'oh-poh-he cannot atlord such pre-&#xD;
sents. Why these jewels are worth more&#xD;
than a year's salary-yes two of 'em 1" he&#xD;
added, as he again examined them. "He&#xD;
could never pay for them in the world, and&#xD;
Charles you know how often I've cautioned&#xD;
you not to go in debt -"&#xD;
"But father, these are already paid for. I&#xD;
got them for my Mary. not to add to her&#xD;
beauty, but to let the world see she has&#xD;
a husband who loves her and who does not&#xD;
wish to see her outrivalled in splendor by&#xD;
any lady in the land!"       .&#xD;
'Pa.J for them !" said the old gentleman,&#xD;
keenly scrutinizing the countenance of his&#xD;
son-in-law: "Paid for them-Charles, how&#xD;
much did they cost?"&#xD;
"Five thousand dollars, Sir !"&#xD;
&#xD;
MISFOHrTUNE ; OR,&#xD;
"And pray where did you get five thou-&#xD;
sand dollars?"&#xD;
The old gentleman's brow clouded as he&#xD;
asked the question. Perchance suspicions&#xD;
of broken trust flashed through his brain.&#xD;
"Dear father, I will explain !" said the&#xD;
young wife.&#xD;
"No, Mary, mine has been the wrong, let&#xD;
me also suffer the humiliation of making&#xD;
the explanation !" said Charles, blushing as&#xD;
red as carnation.&#xD;
. "The wrong? why what on earth have&#xD;
you been doing ?"&#xD;
"Father, I bought a lottery ticket and it&#xD;
drew a ten thousand dollar prize !"&#xD;
"A lottery ticket/! Charles llrennon. have&#xD;
I not often told you that lottery and policy&#xD;
dealing was the most dangerous kind of&#xD;
gambling, that it was delusive yet tempt-&#xD;
ing, that it drew its victims on with pleasant&#xD;
hopes till it got them entangled in ruin's&#xD;
net, whence they can never extricate them-&#xD;
selves ?"&#xD;
"You have, father, but on this occasion&#xD;
I was sorely tempted-I wanted to make&#xD;
my Mary a bridal present worthy of her,&#xD;
and for a few shillings, I have been enabled&#xD;
to do so, and have now nearly four thousand&#xD;
dollars in hand which I thought would be&#xD;
useful in your business, especially as even&#xD;
Wall street now groans under a pressure&#xD;
for money ."&#xD;
"Never a cent of money so gained should&#xD;
go into my business, Sir !" said the old&#xD;
man sternly.&#xD;
"Dear father,"-and a soft hand was&#xD;
gently laid upon his arm, and a pair of&#xD;
tearful blue eyes looked up into his, and&#xD;
a pair of ruby lips quivered over their pearly&#xD;
petals, like the leaves of the red-i ose in the&#xD;
morning  breeze-"Dear Father forgive&#xD;
him. It is his first offence. I know it will&#xD;
be his last !"&#xD;
"Hlowdo you know that? It is a temp-&#xD;
tation which grows on men-my daughter !"&#xD;
said the father as he tenderly kissed the&#xD;
forehead of his sweet good child.&#xD;
"I know it father, because he has already&#xD;
promised, yes sworn it shall be his last error&#xD;
&#xD;
THE VT TMR OF LOTTERY AND POLICY DEALER                   4&#xD;
lather see how bad he feels, forgive him or present to Mary. He loves her, is a good&#xD;
,o' will break my heart !"           husband, I'll raise his salary  $500 to-&#xD;
She bursts into tears as she said this, and morrow, ifhe keeps right for three months,&#xD;
while she twined her arms around his neck, I'll make him a full partner. And he offered&#xD;
the hot rain of grief fell in large drops up- to throw the rest of his money in my busi-&#xD;
on his neck. Charles Brennon also wept. ness. I guess I'd better take him up-these&#xD;
The father's stern nature melted before this charity Asylums are all rich enough-Ys&#xD;
&#xD;
a snow melts when springshowerfallsupo&#xD;
it. His own eyes were moist, and his voic&#xD;
trembled when he replied to her tenderly&#xD;
pasionate appeal. Nature triumphed oven&#xD;
bhs sense of justice, duty yielded to feel.&#xD;
"I will forgive him for your sake, my&#xD;
child, on condition that lie never purchases&#xD;
another; if he does, from that moment he&#xD;
enters my store no more, nor will I regard&#xD;
him as a son.. As to the ill-gotten money&#xD;
which he yet retains, let him expend it in&#xD;
_ charity, as an expiation for his fault, and&#xD;
you my angel child shall direethim how to&#xD;
disburse it 1"&#xD;
"Dear Father I thank you for his sake&#xD;
and mine !" said the daughter, and smiles&#xD;
came out radiantly upon her peerless face,&#xD;
a' the sun through a shower shines some-&#xD;
nimes upon a field of flowers.&#xD;
"And I will sin no more, Sir ! Believe&#xD;
ue this is my first fault-do not let it de-&#xD;
troy your confidence in me !"&#xD;
"It shall not, Charles, because you have&#xD;
yo candidly acknowledged your fault. Had&#xD;
you concealed it, or tried to deceive me, I&#xD;
should never have forgotten it S"&#xD;
Mary did not say it, but she looked the&#xD;
words" Yea see I was right, Charles.n&#xD;
Though all thus had been amicably set-&#xD;
tled, there seemed to be a gloom hanging&#xD;
aver the little fainily circle, and in a short&#xD;
-      tine Mr. Brennon left the house.&#xD;
"'.'en thousand dollars ! he muttered to&#xD;
himself, musingly as hewalked towards the&#xD;
herry--"ten  thousand dollars.  Charles&#xD;
made a lucky hit-ten thousand dollars at&#xD;
an expenditure of only a few shillings.&#xD;
N:'     It is indeed enough to tempt any man.&#xD;
Much as I know of its evils, of the fatality&#xD;
-'    of such temptations, it almost sets me into&#xD;
L       the fever. Ten thousand dollars-.and he&#xD;
did It only that he might make a bridal&#xD;
&#xD;
n I'll have a talk with him in the morning.&#xD;
e Ten thousand dollars I What a lucky hit I"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
ANoTHER week has passed in our story.&#xD;
Let us see what changes time has worked.&#xD;
First we will pay a visit to the rooms of Mr.&#xD;
Tullius Catlin. lie is not there-but Con-&#xD;
stance Morley is. Is she altered? Yes.-.&#xD;
Her cheeks glow with 'a rosier, healthier&#xD;
hue. The sallow pallor produced by her&#xD;
constant labor as she bent over her sewing&#xD;
work, has vanished. The eyes red and dim&#xD;
by late work by a glimmering candle, are&#xD;
bright and clear as drops of ocean-water&#xD;
sparkling in a seashell's rosy bosom. She&#xD;
has had time to arrange her glossy hair.&#xD;
Her dress, though still plain, is more neat&#xD;
and richer than that she wore before. And&#xD;
look, as she sits at the writing table, a dia-&#xD;
niend ring glitters upon a finger of the&#xD;
hand in which she holds her pen. She has&#xD;
piued in her writing and seems to be re-&#xD;
garding the jewelled circlet of gold intent-&#xD;
ly. Hark-she speaks. Let us listen to&#xD;
her thoughts.&#xD;
"He must love m    she murmurs. "lis&#xD;
never-varying kindness, this costly present.&#xD;
so delicately given too, all go to prove it.&#xD;
I-(shc sighed softly as she spoke)-I do&#xD;
not lore him, but he-Seems so sad and lone-&#xD;
ly that I pity him. I wish I could make&#xD;
him happy! He ought to be happy-he&#xD;
seems so good, he has every luxury that&#xD;
boundless wealth can command, it is strange&#xD;
that he should be unhappy!"&#xD;
She hd not heard a noiseless step whtca&#xD;
approached over the heavy Brussels car.&#xD;

&#xD;
pt---she did not know that the words&#xD;
audibly uttered in her revery had been&#xD;
overheard and that too by him of whom&#xD;
she was speaking. Therefore it was that&#xD;
she started almost to her feet and blushed&#xD;
to her very brow as she heard himin a low&#xD;
sad tone say :&#xD;
"Why is it so strange, Miss Constanco,&#xD;
that I who am alone in a world which is&#xD;
made up of deceit and hypocrisy, should be&#xD;
unhappy?"&#xD;
"I did not know that you were near me,&#xD;
Sir !" said Constance, so confused and agi-&#xD;
tated that she could scarcely speak I&#xD;
"I did not intend to be a listener, fair&#xD;
lady, but my ear is quick to catch the sweet&#xD;
sounds of sympathy--I heard enough to&#xD;
convince me that you were speaking of mc.&#xD;
I could not interrupt you !"&#xD;
"Oh sir, I was only thanking you in my&#xD;
heart for this beautiful ring-but it is too&#xD;
rich a gift, for a poor girl like me, to wear!"&#xD;
"Poor, Miss Morley? Oh that all your&#xD;
sex were rich as you are-rich alone in&#xD;
your purity of heart, your goodness, your&#xD;
noble nature? All the gold in California&#xD;
cannot gild defects, cannot brighten or res-&#xD;
tore the lustre of tarnished virtue-cannot&#xD;
make a heartless woman lovely. You are&#xD;
rich-rich enough to awaken envy in many&#xD;
a city belle who gazes on your loveliness;&#xD;
rich enough in your goodness and innocence&#xD;
to wim and deserve the worshipping love of&#xD;
the noblest in our land !"&#xD;
"Oh Mr. Catlin, this is flattery!',&#xD;
"No, Constance; excuse me, Mmi Morley,&#xD;
I mean-I never stoop to flattery. You&#xD;
have already seen enough of me to know&#xD;
that candor is a part of my nature!"&#xD;
"I acknowledge that, Sir-but I do not&#xD;
feel myself worthy of so great a compliment&#xD;
as that which you have paid me!"&#xD;
"The meritorious are always modest ! I&#xD;
have watched you closely-each day has&#xD;
made me more sensible of your merit. But&#xD;
I-will not intrude on you any further just&#xD;
now, for I have business, and you have sev-&#xD;
eral letters to answer for me1"&#xD;
After Catlin left, lid she at once hasten&#xD;
to write those letters?  No / She still&#xD;
&#xD;
gazed on the glittering ring which bound&#xD;
her finger, gaed upon it as we can imagine&#xD;
Eve gazed on the forbidden fruit-and with&#xD;
a sigh she murmured :&#xD;
"I am sure he loves me ! But I do not&#xD;
love him, I only pity him because he is ald&#xD;
and lonely !&#xD;
Poor girl she did not know her own heart.&#xD;
Nor.did she dream what an arch-fiend, what&#xD;
a consummate hypocrite, what a vice-hap-&#xD;
tised, sin-soaked villain her supposed benie-&#xD;
factfor was."&#xD;
What did he say after he left her? Chuck-&#xD;
ling in his devilish glee, he muttered, "Ive&#xD;
got her fast now. The bait is taken. It is&#xD;
but one step from sympathy to love, and&#xD;
gratitude has lifted her over that. She is&#xD;
safe. In a few days I shall be revenged for&#xD;
the insult her father gave me-I shall revel&#xD;
in bliss which would tempt a saint to for-&#xD;
swear his hopes of heaven, and shall add&#xD;
another to my list of victories, another to&#xD;
my roll of victims. Yes, Constance Morley,&#xD;
you soon shall be mine, soul and body !&#xD;
Thus ends one chapter of a week of Ti'me's&#xD;
rapid change in our story. Now for a&#xD;
glance at the same week's work elsewhere&#xD;
among our Dramatis persona.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
CArTN and Grab were seated in the office&#xD;
of the latter. Grab as usual, occupied two&#xD;
chairs-the smoke of one of Springsteel '&#xD;
prime native made Habana's curled up&#xD;
from his lips, and he looked as satisfied as&#xD;
if all his gold had not been washed in the&#xD;
tears of countless victims to his thieving&#xD;
arts.&#xD;
"We've made a good week's work, net-&#xD;
ted about $60,000, clear of expenses !" he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Pretty fair, rather above middling !"&#xD;
said Catlin, "but we've got matters in a line&#xD;
which will treble our profits. Who do&#xD;
you think I saw buying a ticket in James&#xD;
&#xD;
back office this morning-a wealthy mer&#xD;
chant. who till now has been down dn u&#xD;
tremendously,.one of our bitterest opposers!'&#xD;
"I don't know who it can be?"&#xD;
"Guess !"-&#xD;
"For the life of me I cannot. I expect i&#xD;
is some old codger that you have roped in!'&#xD;
"No-lhe has roped himself in! What d&#xD;
you think of Mr. Brent?"&#xD;
"What, Charles Brennon's father-in-law?'&#xD;
"The self-same individual&#xD;
"Why I thought he was so opposed to i&#xD;
that we had to let Brennon win a prize t(&#xD;
keep him in hand!"&#xD;
"Yes, and so it was, but I've an idea thai&#xD;
our letting Chiarley Brennon draw a prize&#xD;
has had something to do with this matter&#xD;
I've not seen Charley yet, to find out, butI&#xD;
can almost account for the sudden con-&#xD;
version of the old gent. He sneaked in as&#xD;
if he felt afraid some one would know he&#xD;
didn't go there for exchange."&#xD;
"Well,.it is singular-you said well, I&#xD;
think, when you told me that the prize&#xD;
wouldn't bme lost on Brennon !"&#xD;
"1 wouldn't be surprised if we made fifty&#xD;
or sixty thousand dollars out of them now.&#xD;
They are both hooked. James has the num-&#xD;
ber of the ticket which the old man bought,&#xD;
checked, and we're going to let him draw&#xD;
a small prize first to fasten the hook in his&#xD;
gills. These merchants are so used to large&#xD;
speculations, that when we get them once&#xD;
into the humor, they don't know where to&#xD;
stop!"&#xD;
"That's a fact. By the way, Tullius,&#xD;
have you heard from Vanroy, lately I"&#xD;
"Yes, I received a letter this morning!"&#xD;
"How is lie getting on&#xD;
"Famously! le has got two of the best&#xD;
Boston hotel keepers to act as private&#xD;
agents for us--has got a dozen young bucks&#xD;
of the ton who have more money than brains,&#xD;
to try their luck; and three or four clerks&#xD;
in big houses to do the same. He has got&#xD;
the cashier of a bank in State street to try&#xD;
his hand. I shall be sure that he draws a&#xD;
good prize right on the start I"&#xD;
"Well, act on your own judgment-you&#xD;
have a carte blanche, on know! flow is&#xD;
&#xD;
- Vanroy getting on in the matrimonial ape-&#xD;
s culation you told me of?"&#xD;
"   '"It is all in afair way, but a woman came&#xD;
near spoiling his chance there !"&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
t "Well, through jealousy. Gus, for somo-&#xD;
"time had been keeping her as the Mor-&#xD;
o mons do. as a spiritual wife--he was&#xD;
not legally married to her and tried to cast&#xD;
" her off, so that he would be free to court&#xD;
and marry the young heiress he is after.&#xD;
t The woman found out his plans, and wrote&#xD;
o to old Anthon, the partner of Gus, that he&#xD;
was married and had a baby I"&#xD;
t "How on earth did Gus get out of that ?"&#xD;
"Persuaded the old man that it was all a&#xD;
. lie, got the woman off out of town, siooth-&#xD;
ed the matter over, and now all is as clear&#xD;
as day before him  Gus is a smart boy,&#xD;
an honor to our profession !"&#xD;
"He isn't anything else! Is that Glendye&#xD;
matter all settled ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and Glendye is on his way to Cal-&#xD;
ifornia; we must be moie careful whom wb&#xD;
choose for agents. This new law is cursed&#xD;
tight I"&#xD;
"It would be if policemen, jurors, and&#xD;
judges could'nt be bribed? we are safe from&#xD;
the law as long as our golden spectacles&#xD;
can be worn on the nose of justice !"&#xD;
"That is true !"replied Catlin, "and nearly&#xD;
all of our New York officials have weak&#xD;
eyes when there is a chance of getting gold&#xD;
spectacles to wear !  If I had a hundred&#xD;
thousand to spare, I would not fear to com-&#xD;
mit every crime in the calendar, I could get&#xD;
clear as easy as a trout from a pin-hook.&#xD;
Money is all that a man wants to walk over&#xD;
the upper-crust with in New York."&#xD;
"Yes, and we've got our share, but this&#xD;
cursed law forces us to disgorge too much&#xD;
of our winnings."&#xD;
"Well, it can't be helped. Police officers&#xD;
and judges get small salaries and they must&#xD;
live, you know!"&#xD;

&#xD;
situation of Laura, the poor cast-off mistress&#xD;
of Vanroy. Deceived by the plausible villain,&#xD;
she had agreed to leave Boston, she wasj&#xD;
even happy when seated in the carriage by&#xD;
his side, holding her cherished child in her,&#xD;
arms, she passed from Boston at the still&#xD;
midnight hour. She had not noticed that,&#xD;
two men sat on the driver's box, nor did she&#xD;
even note the direction in which they start-&#xD;
ed. In fact the last would have been near-&#xD;
ly impossible. The night was dark and the&#xD;
blinds of the carriage were closed, as Van-&#xD;
roy kindly suggested to k~ep the cold night&#xD;
air from his darling child.&#xD;
The carriage drove on quite rapidly for&#xD;
about two hours, perhaps a little more, and&#xD;
then drew up before a small stone house&#xD;
which was almost entirely shaded and hid-&#xD;
den from the view of travellers on the road,&#xD;
by a grove of elms. The carriage door open-&#xD;
ed, and the little Jew pawn-broker who&#xD;
opened it said:&#xD;
"We are here at mine leetle country seat.&#xD;
mishter Vanroy-you and your coot lady&#xD;
are varee welcome to make it your home so&#xD;
long ash you lik 8 "a&#xD;
"Who is that man ?" asked Laura, in a&#xD;
whisper, as she clasped her sleeping boy in&#xD;
her arms and wound the shawl close around&#xD;
his tiny form, ready to step from the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
"A friend-I'll tell you as soa as we get&#xD;
into the house !"&#xD;
lint half satisfied, dreading something, she&#xD;
knew not what, she entered the house. Pas-&#xD;
sing through a gateway, she heard the gate&#xD;
,wing heavily on its hinges, and thought&#xD;
she heard a key turned behind them. They&#xD;
had to pause, while Ishinael their guide,&#xD;
knocked at the door.  Ishmael spoke in a&#xD;
tongue unknown to her and was in a mo-&#xD;
ment or two, answered from within in a&#xD;
similar language. The door then opened&#xD;
and two persons appeared. The oldest, a&#xD;
dried-up looking old woman, quite meanly&#xD;
apparelled, held a light in her hand. Half&#xD;
shrinking behind her, as she observed stran-&#xD;
gers, stood a beautiful young girl, evidently&#xD;
of Jewish origin. She was probably fifteen&#xD;
or sixteen years of age, that sweet age&#xD;
&#xD;
when beauty is in its bud and like the open-&#xD;
ing rose is most lovely. As Ishmael step-&#xD;
ped forward, he said to the elder woman,&#xD;
"Repecca-I have brought some frent&#xD;
vich viii sojourn-a leetle viles vith us!"&#xD;
Then turning to Laura and Vanroy he add-&#xD;
ed. "Dish, mine coot frents is mine ho'hsli&#xD;
keeper and dere is mine daughter, Miriam&#xD;
Come here -Miriam, mine child-dish is&#xD;
Mishter and Mishtress Vanroy-you must&#xD;
make dem comfortable, you and Repecca&#xD;
vile they sthay mit us 1"&#xD;
"Yes, dear father f" said the young girl,&#xD;
coming forward and imprinting a kiss with&#xD;
her cherry-red lips upon his wrinkled brow.&#xD;
The party passed on through a dark, chil-&#xD;
ly hall, and entered a room which contrast-&#xD;
ed strangely with the rough and gloomy&#xD;
appearance outside of the house. It was&#xD;
elegantly furnished. A glowing fire burned&#xD;
in the grate. Wealth had been lavishly ex-&#xD;
pended in furniture, paintings and works of&#xD;
art. As soon as Vanroy and Laura were&#xD;
seated, the housekeeper asked if she should&#xD;
prepare some refreshnnent for them. This&#xD;
was declined.&#xD;
"Oh what a dear, sweet little baby !" sail&#xD;
Miriam, as the mother took the shawl and&#xD;
wrappers from around her child.  And the&#xD;
Jewish maiden bent on one knee and kissed&#xD;
the sleeping cherub.&#xD;
"I have one friend in this house, at least.&#xD;
thought Laura, as with a mother's pride she&#xD;
noticed the action.&#xD;
"If your housekeeper will show my lady&#xD;
the room which she is to occupy, I will ac-&#xD;
company them for a moment !" said Vanroy&#xD;
to Ishmael-"I have to return to the city&#xD;
to night l"&#xD;
"To-night, Augustus?"&#xD;
"Yes, love, that I may hurry through&#xD;
my business and be the sooner ready to go&#xD;
with you as we have arranged !"&#xD;
"Then let me see you alone a few mo-&#xD;
mentsbefore you go. I have much to say&#xD;
to you!-"&#xD;
The okl housekeeper took alight and led&#xD;
the way to a chamber, as neatly furuished&#xD;
as the parlor they had just left. Placing the&#xD;
&#xD;
light on the centre table, she left the&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
"Augustus!" said Laura, after she ha&#xD;
laid her child down on the couch, and car&#xD;
fully covered it-" Augustus, are you no&#xD;
deceiving me in some way "&#xD;
"So help me heaven, I'm  not !" he r&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
"Then why is it that you did not tak&#xD;
me to the tavern in a village near Worces&#xD;
ter, that you spoke of?"&#xD;
"Because after I went out I thought o&#xD;
this country seat which belongs to the old&#xD;
man we saw below. He is a friend to whom&#xD;
I had letters of introduction, an ExchangE&#xD;
broker of immense wealth, and when I men&#xD;
tioned our case was but too happy to doc&#xD;
me a favor "&#xD;
"Ifyou go to the city again to-night, when&#xD;
will I see you again ?"&#xD;
"By the day after to-morrow, my love !"&#xD;
'Will you then be ready to go South with&#xD;
me ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
'I hope so, Laura-I will arrange my&#xD;
business as hastily as possible !" -&#xD;
"Do, for this will be a gloomy place to&#xD;
ine. I do not like the looks of that Jew,&#xD;
nor of his housekeeper. But his daughter&#xD;
seems to be a kind, amiable creature!1"&#xD;
"And no doubt she is. She will be pleas-&#xD;
ant company to you, and prevent you feel-&#xD;
ing lonesome !"&#xD;
"Dear Gus, I would be lonesome in the&#xD;
company of angels if you were not there i"&#xD;
"Well love-one good-night kiss, and then&#xD;
I must hasten back !'-&#xD;
"Oh do nit go till morning, Gus i"&#xD;
"I must my dear. I must be in the city&#xD;
very early '"&#xD;
"Then go, God bless you-hurry back, I&#xD;
shall count the minutes till you come I"&#xD;
A burning kiss and an embrace- fond on&#xD;
one side but cold as hypocrisy on the other,&#xD;
and he was gone. The mother knelt by the&#xD;
bedside whereon her sleeping babe lay and&#xD;
prayed for him who was even then so base-&#xD;
ly deceiving her.&#xD;
&#xD;
While Vanroy was conversing with Laura&#xD;
ap stairs, Ishmael in anotherapartment was&#xD;

&#xD;
m prisoner. There were three in the room,&#xD;
and the third one was not Miriam. He'&#xD;
d was a huge, stupid looking man,who though&#xD;
- he seemed to listen to the orders given, hard&#xD;
t ly seemed capable of understanding them.&#xD;
The orders were to supply Laura with every&#xD;
comfort, but at all hazards to prevent her&#xD;
leaving the house or the enclosure which sur-&#xD;
e rounded it. She was not to be informed&#xD;
- that she was a prisoner, and he gave minute&#xD;
directions in regard to the excuses to ho&#xD;
f made to keep her within doors. As a last&#xD;
resort, he left some powders, which though&#xD;
they would not destroy life, would throw her&#xD;
on a sick-bed if taken with her'food. Hav-&#xD;
. ing concluded these directions he rejoined&#xD;
Vanroy and they at once re-entered the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
"Have you arranged everything'for her&#xD;
safe-keeping ?" asked Vanroy as they drove&#xD;
off.&#xD;
"Yesh Mister Vanroy-she is safe ash my&#xD;
monish, or ash mine own taughter'"&#xD;
"Your daughter is very beautiful !" said&#xD;
Vanroy&#xD;
" Yeah-so was her modder pefore her!"&#xD;
replied the Jew, sighing heavily. "Yesh&#xD;
Miriam is a coot gal, she knows nothing of&#xD;
the wont and its padness, I never lets her&#xD;
go from de place at all!"&#xD;
For some time they went along in silence,,&#xD;
each occupied with their own thoughts.&#xD;
Ishmael was the first to speak.&#xD;
"I dink you told me to-night Mister Van-&#xD;
roy dat if dish lady and der child is sent&#xD;
from de country so dat no more dey troubles&#xD;
you, you will give five thousand dollare de&#xD;

"Yes, I said so and will do it i"&#xD;

a passport to come back !"&#xD;
"But no harm must befall her.'-&#xD;
"Oh no, dere ish no danger of dat. Eve-&#xD;

Again both sunk back into silence which&#xD;
was not again broken till they reached the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
CoNSTANcE MlORLEY was at nor post. en&#xD;
gaged in writing as usual. She had now&#xD;
been nearly two weeks in the employ o&#xD;
Mr. Catlin, who to her had ever been obse-&#xD;
quiously polite. He seemed ever sad and&#xD;
low spirited. He required but very little&#xD;
labor at her hands. IIer copying never oc-&#xD;
cupied her more than an hour or so, yet hcr&#xD;
salary was very liberal. What wonder then,&#xD;
that in so short a time he should have awa-&#xD;
kened in her young heart a deep and a dan-&#xD;
gerous interest. Remember- that she who&#xD;
had in her early youth known comfort and&#xD;
even affluence, had since then been steeped&#xD;
in poverty, that she had toiled early and&#xD;
late, by the dim light of the midnight taper&#xD;
and by the cheerless rays of the rising su&#xD;
to earn the bare necessaries of life, and now&#xD;
by an apparently kind hand which seemed&#xD;
to ask no recompense except the power to&#xD;
do good, no reward which could raise a&#xD;
blush upon the cheek of virtue, she found&#xD;
herself independent and comfortable, able&#xD;
to support her only surviving parent in&#xD;
ease. Then wonder not, that all unknown&#xD;
to herself, gratitude had given way to a&#xD;
stronger feeling, that in the fulness of her&#xD;
young, passionate nature, she loeed her sup-&#xD;
Josed benefactor.&#xD;
&#xD;
I said in the commencement of this chap-&#xD;
ter that she was as usual at her post. It&#xD;
was morning, nine or ten o'clock. At thej&#xD;
same table, on the opposite side, Mr. Catlin&#xD;
was also engaged in writing. He laid down&#xD;
his pen after using it a short time, and sigh-&#xD;
ed deeply. She raised her eyes-they met&#xD;
his, for he was gazing at her. His look&#xD;
was so sad that she could not help noticing&#xD;
it, could not refrain from speaking.&#xD;
"Are you not well this morning, Mr. Cat-&#xD;
lin?" she asked..&#xD;
"As well as usual. Miss Constance 1" he&#xD;
replied, sighing a un.&#xD;
"You seem so sari, Mr. Catlin Y"&#xD;
"What have I to make me gay?"&#xD;
"You have nothing to make you sad, Mr.&#xD;
Catlin. You possess wealth and wealth is&#xD;
power ! Power used for good, as you use&#xD;
it, must be happiness. I almost envied you&#xD;
when I saw the gleam of grateful pleasure&#xD;
light up that old gentleman's countenance&#xD;
when you promised to assist him yesterday I"&#xD;
'Yet happiness does not consist in wealth,&#xD;
fair lady. Wealth may in a measure con-&#xD;
duce to it, but wealth cannot make a wint-&#xD;
cry world warm. It cannot restore foliage&#xD;
to the blasted tree, it cannot give life to the&#xD;
wilted flower. There is but one thing which&#xD;
can make a true heart happy I"&#xD;
"And what is tpat, Mr. Catlin ?"&#xD;
it"Love, Constance, ivzl Love though&#xD;
it dwells in the narrow cell of a prison, or&#xD;
within the contracted hounds of a peasant's&#xD;
cot, will gild life, when gold clings like a&#xD;
leaden weight upon the heart and clogs the&#xD;
wheels of joy. H-ow then can one all unlov-&#xD;
ed like myself, he happy I"&#xD;
"Oh Sir, you are not unloved !"&#xD;
"Then as if conscious of having commit-&#xD;
ted an unmaidenly impropriety both in the&#xD;
warmth of her tone and looks, the face of&#xD;
Constance became crimson with blushes.&#xD;
Catlin observed, he saw he had struck the&#xD;
right chord, and he dared not let it die away&#xD;
for he might never recall the sound again.&#xD;
"XNot unloved ?" he said-" Oh Con-&#xD;
stance if I could hope for love where I in&#xD;
secret have planted the seeds of my first af-&#xD;
fection, oh then, I could hope yet to be&#xD;
&#xD;
happy. Forgive me Constance, I can con-&#xD;
ceal it no longer, I love you-yqu only I&#xD;
From the hour when we first met, I have&#xD;
felt in my heart emotions to which it before&#xD;
was a stranger. I have gazed upon your&#xD;
beauty as the flower ever turning toward&#xD;
the sun drinks in its brightness. I have&#xD;
listened to the silvery tones of yeur voice&#xD;
and wished that you might speak forever.&#xD;
Oh Constance, is there a hope that my love&#xD;
will be returned. You can make me happy&#xD;
-you can make me miserable-I My fate,&#xD;
my very life is in your hands! Oh speak,&#xD;
dearest, and end my suspense !"&#xD;
While he made this passionate appeal,&#xD;
he drew near to her, suddenly he dropped&#xD;
on his knee at her feet and clasping her&#xD;
small white hands in his, looked up implor-&#xD;
ingly in her face, in her liquid eyes, await-&#xD;
ing, by his looks beseeching a reply.&#xD;
She did not withdraw her hands-she&#xD;
bowed her head upon his shoulder and wept.&#xD;
She did not chide him when he kissed the&#xD;
tears from her cheek ; she did not reprove&#xD;
him when his arm stole around her slender&#xD;
waist ; she did not frown' when bolder still&#xD;
he planted burning kisses on her red lips.&#xD;
Though she spoke not, he was answered.&#xD;
When he again more calmly seated him-&#xD;
self by her side, he took her hand in his and-&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Dear Constance, the world is no longer&#xD;
a wilderness to me, I am happy!"&#xD;
"If Ican make you happy, then I shall&#xD;
be happy!" she murmured.&#xD;
Then as reason resumed its sway, as she&#xD;
emerged from the confusion into which his&#xD;
sudden  and  vehement declaration had&#xD;
thrown her, Constance began to feel the in-&#xD;
equality of Catlin's circumstances and her&#xD;
own.&#xD;
"Why should you, who are wealthy,&#xD;
graced in form and strong in intellect, love&#xD;
a penniless girl like me I" she said. "You&#xD;
can win and wear the brightest, richest&#xD;
jewel in the land I For your own sake for-&#xD;
get poor Constance, seek some beautiful&#xD;
heiress, some mate more worthy of you !"&#xD;
"Sooner would I seek a bride within the&#xD;

goodness, in purity, in affection, in beauty,&#xD;
outweighs all the gold on earth. The only&#xD;

Again he clasped her to his breast.&#xD;
Again his hot lips were glowed to hers.&#xD;
Her heaving bosom, her trembling form,&#xD;
her flushed cheeks, her eyes languidly bril-&#xD;
liant, like violets overladened with dew,&#xD;
her short-drawn sighs, betokened her feel-&#xD;

ChAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
WHEN Catlin left Grab, he hastened to&#xD;
his own apartnint. Constance was there.&#xD;
In every scene, describing her as she was, I&#xD;
have painted her beautiful, but now, her&#xD;
face glowing with the rosy sun-light of&#xD;
happiness, her eyes sparkling with th holy&#xD;
dew of pure joy, every vein thrillimg with&#xD;
pleasure which she did not try to conceal,&#xD;
her bosom throbbing with the waxc-like&#xD;

beautiful.&#xD;
When Catlin pressed her passionately to&#xD;
his bosom, she lid not repulse himt ; when&#xD;
his burning lips met hers she did not :hrwik&#xD;
from his tirery kisses, she knew no danger,&#xD;
her heart and soul was centred imi one wild&#xD;
mad thought, it was love, even to Wlora-&#xD;
lion! When a true woman loves for the&#xD;
first time, her love is like the zeal of a new&#xD;
convert-it is all faith all con/idener with&#xD;
her. And never cai she, if once deceived,&#xD;
love again as she has (lone. After his fond&#xD;
embrace and a few passionate caresses. Cat-&#xD;
n seated himself by her side and more&#xD;
methodically proceeded to "business."&#xD;
"Dear Constance," he said, " since we&#xD;
both love, our union need not be delayed!&#xD;
I have no parents to consult, I have only an&#xD;
uncle to please, and he is in Carolina. I&#xD;
would like to please him in my choice for&#xD;

see it go into the hands of strangers !"&#xD;
"Why do you not write him and ask his&#xD;
consent !"&#xD;
"It would take three weeks to get an&#xD;

"She will not object I"&#xD;
"Oh no, I do not fear that, but then&#xD;
there are many preparations," said th&#xD;
blushing girl, "which I must make. Ihave&#xD;

"I will charter a whole dress-makers es&#xD;

"Then sweet girl do not delay my hap-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV&#xD;
Two days had passed since Vanroy left&#xD;
Laura and her child at Ishmael's country&#xD;
residence. The first day passed off rather&#xD;
wearily, though Miriam the lovely daughter&#xD;
of the Jew, passed most of it in her comu-&#xD;
pany, toying with the beautiful child and&#xD;
trying to amuse her with her simple talk.&#xD;
Miriam was evidently a child of Nature.&#xD;
Her father had guarded her with nistr&#xD;
like care from all contact with the world.&#xD;
She had never been abroad except in his&#xD;
company and very few visitors, and those&#xD;
only of his own selection, ever visited the&#xD;
house. Never was veiled and cloistered&#xD;
nun guarded more watchfully than she.&#xD;
On the morning of the second day, Laura&#xD;
accompanied by Miriam descended to the&#xD;
garden, which surrounded by a very high&#xD;
stone wall, like a prison yard, lay back of&#xD;
the house. It was beautifully arranged and&#xD;
kept in constant order by the coarse and&#xD;
repulsive looking man, who was described&#xD;
in the twentyseventh chapter. Miriam had&#xD;
attended to many of the flowers, for liko&#xD;
most young girls she was very fond of them.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
. Fr was evening. Mary Brennon was seat-&#xD;
&#xD;
ITE VTCrTMs OF LOIrR&#xD;
ed in her little sitting room, waiting for&#xD;
her husband to return from his business.&#xD;
Tea was ready. but he waslater than usual.&#xD;
Was it a wonder that she looked at the&#xD;
clock and sighed? That young wife was&#xD;
thinking how early her husband had hur-&#xD;
ried home during the first-days of their&#xD;
marriage-how,almost breathless from haste&#xD;
he came it and clasping her fondly to his&#xD;
bosom imprinting fervent kisses on her lips&#xD;
and brow. And she sighed because she&#xD;
felt that a change was coining over him,&#xD;
that the spring-time of love was losing its&#xD;
freshest, sweetest flowers.&#xD;
So it is too often with man, somefincs&#xD;
with woman. They love madly, wildly, at&#xD;
first, are hungry in their attachment, but&#xD;
then like one who his partakei of a hearty&#xD;
meal, they are satisfied, their appetite cloys&#xD;
and their hunger is appeased-love gives&#xD;
way to indifference and at last it becomes&#xD;
utter forgetfulness. Like the sti'camraised&#xD;
in a mountain ravine by a sudden shower,&#xD;
the torrent is for a brief time resistless and&#xD;
impetous-like it when the shower is over,&#xD;
the source is dried up by the sun and the&#xD;
stream is no more.&#xD;
" He used always to be home by six1"&#xD;
murmured Mrs. B.-" it is now after seven,&#xD;
nearly eight. Charles Is changing-he is&#xD;
neglectfulI"&#xD;
Her face before so sad, suddenly lighted&#xD;
up with joy, now, for she heard his well-&#xD;
known step at the door. She rose and hur-&#xD;
ried to the door. expecting the kiss and&#xD;
inbrace which he had always been so ready&#xD;
to give, But she was disappointed when&#xD;
he entered the rioon, for he merely remark-&#xD;
as lie took of' his hat, " You needn't have&#xD;
waited tea for me. Mary. I dined qnite late&#xD;
with a friend!" '&#xD;
No kiss-no kind word, no fond look.&#xD;
tier heart felt chiled-she felt stifled-she&#xD;
could scarcely'restrain a rising tear.&#xD;
"A cup of tea will do you good, dear&#xD;
Charles!" she murmured.&#xD;
"No, I don't like tea, especially after&#xD;
I've been drinking wine I"l he replied, cast-&#xD;
himself drowsily lown on the sofa.&#xD;
Mary had noticed that his face was flushed&#xD;
&#xD;
T AND POLICY DEALERS.                83*&#xD;
when he came in, and thought that it way&#xD;
caused by his rapid walking.  But whet&#xD;
she bent over him to fix the cushion of the&#xD;
sofa under his head, she detected from his&#xD;
breath the cause of the flush, and for the&#xD;
first time the fear came upon her that she&#xD;
had linked hir fate with one who might be-&#xD;
come a drunkard ! In a few nonents lie&#xD;
was asleep, snoring as loud as a Mississippi&#xD;
Steamboat.&#xD;
Then she sat down in a rocking chair by&#xD;
his side, leaving her tea untasted. end&#xD;
wept. Were not the tears of that lurid con-&#xD;
fiding, pure young wife, registered again:-.t&#xD;
him in heaven?  Wehtceve thejy were!&#xD;
At the same hour, while Laura was speed-&#xD;
ing toward the vessel where she expected to&#xD;
meet Vanroy, the latter was seated iii the&#xD;
parlor of Mr. Anthon, whispering low-toned&#xD;
words of love from his perjured lips to Lyd-&#xD;
ia. And with all the coniding innocence&#xD;
peculiar to a maiden who knows but little&#xD;
of the world, the young girl wif t willing&#xD;
ears listened to him. lie was her first love,&#xD;
-in her imagination lie was perfection p&#xD;
sonified-all riobleness, nl generosity, all&#xD;
goodness-and then she thought he twas so&#xD;
very handsome ! Iler lips coveted his his-&#xD;
ses-his voice was sweetest music in her ea.&#xD;
Already-she looked upon herself as almost&#xD;
his wife.&#xD;
"IHas your sister consented to tc married&#xD;

Lydia, "but Eugenia thinks it is too hasty,&#xD;

"I hope they can be hurried up, clear&#xD;

the deck. But he. Augustus Vanroy, di&#xD;

The sails of the vessel were spread-bu&#xD;
a single rope held her to the wharf, th&#xD;
breeze was fresh, and all the time freshen&#xD;
iifg from the northwest, and the old craf&#xD;
tugged at the rope like an oat-fed hors&#xD;
with a green pasture in sight.&#xD;
"Mein cot in himmels, vy der duyvel&#xD;
don't he come !" muttered the skipper, a&#xD;
he sent volumes of smoke up from his tier&#xD;
schauin pipe. Eveii as he spoke, Ishmael&#xD;
appeared on the wharf, and puffing an&#xD;
blowing as if he had been running a "quar&#xD;
ter-race,' came aboard, lie drew a can&#xD;
'ass bag from his pocket and handing it to&#xD;
the skipper, said-&#xD;
"I)ere, Captain Scratchdermast, dere islh&#xD;

tune isinel leaped on shore, the rope was&#xD;
cast off, the vessel tilled away before the&#xD;

"My husband ! oh, do not leave Augus-&#xD;
tus, for my baby's sake, wait till he&#xD;
comes !''&#xD;
. Yes, bimeby, when I gets across to Hol-&#xD;
land, den I waits for him !" said the skip-&#xD;
per, with a coarse laugh.&#xD;
Then she understood all, she realised&#xD;
that she had been once     more  basely&#xD;
deceived. She sank down helpless and&#xD;
fainting on the deck.' The rough skipper&#xD;
had heart enough left in his callous frame&#xD;
to feel some pity, and he had her and the&#xD;
child carried below and placed in the best&#xD;
state-room in the cabin.&#xD;
Meantime his craft was dashing out of&#xD;
the bay with flowing sheets, her spars buck-&#xD;
ling and bending under the force of a vale&#xD;
wvhtich as she drew out from the land in-&#xD;
reused in strength. When they discharged&#xD;
their pilot, they had to take in top-gallant&#xD;
sails and an hour later they were under close-&#xD;
&#xD;
i reefed top-sails, the courses hauled up and&#xD;
d siugly furled. The old skipper's face wore&#xD;
a sad and gloomy look as he stood near the&#xD;
t helm, now glancing at the compass, then at&#xD;
e his creaking spars and then to windward&#xD;
- where the clear, cold-looking sky told him&#xD;
t that the gale had hut just commenced to&#xD;
e show its strength.&#xD;
Four hours later. The gale was at its&#xD;
s height. The old craft, now only under her&#xD;
s topsails and the fore-storm-stay-sail,plunged&#xD;
- and pitched into the heavy seas as if she&#xD;
I would bury herself 1Ier crew. silent and&#xD;
1 anxious, were on deck, the old skipper had&#xD;
- thrown away his pipe-he felt that he had&#xD;
m more to do than to smoke just then. Where&#xD;
was Laura ? Sleeping, amidst that turmoil&#xD;
of fearful elements? .Nh. She could not&#xD;
sleep but it wds not the storm that seemed&#xD;
terrible to her-it was the thought that hi'&#xD;
for whom she had perilled, lost all that was&#xD;
worth living for, had deserted her and the&#xD;
sweet child which all unknowing of its de-&#xD;
solation slept upon her bosom. Had it not&#xD;
been for that child, she would have leaped&#xD;
into the foaming yeast of waters and perish-&#xD;
ed, but for him she lived, for him, her angel&#xD;
child, she felt that love, all-enduring and&#xD;
eternal which only a mother can feel.&#xD;
Ten hours later. The night had passed&#xD;
away, but light made the storm appear even&#xD;
more terrible. The topmasts and upper&#xD;
yards had been carried away. The sea rose&#xD;
in great blue mountains, snow-crested with&#xD;
foam. One moment the staggering bark&#xD;
would be lifted high upon their ragged&#xD;
heads, then down,'down in the deep gulfs&#xD;
below she.would plunge, seeming as if she&#xD;
never would rise again.&#xD;
Muttering now a curse and then a prayer.&#xD;
the Dutch skipper stood by the binnacle.&#xD;
glancing often at his compass. The wind&#xD;
had chopped around from the North West&#xD;
and now was nearly East,blowing in toward&#xD;
the shore. Rock-bound as our coast is, the&#xD;
mariner dreads the gale when he cannot&#xD;
spread canvass enough to carry him clear&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
The vessel staggered on. It was noon-&#xD;

place is silent as if no one dwelt there, or&#xD;

CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
IT was morning, and Mr. Brent was in his&#xD;
counting room before nine o'clock, a thing&#xD;
very unusual with him. his face was pale,&#xD;
but his eyes looked red and inflamed, as it&#xD;
he had either beei up late the night before,&#xD;
or had been dissipating.  He paced the&#xD;
room to and fro, after clasping his hands&#xD;
nervously together, and muttering to him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
Over six thousand dollars in one night,&#xD;
gone too at a gambling table ! What led&#xD;
me there? Why did I go ? I was invited&#xD;
as a friend and a gentleman to merely look&#xD;
at the game. I looked at it, others were&#xD;
winning, I thought I could, and now I'm&#xD;
ont over six thousand dollars? And I've&#xD;
spent nearly a thousand dollars for lottery&#xD;
tickets since I drew a prize. But luck must&#xD;
change. I wish Charley would come with&#xD;
the key of the safe, I must win in my next&#xD;
trial. I'll buy tickets, they're better than&#xD;
faro, at any rate I wont spend money so fast&#xD;
in them. Aft-there's Charley I"&#xD;
Charles lBrennon too looked worn-out and&#xD;
jaded as he entered the counting room. But&#xD;
he noticed the looks of his father-in-law in&#xD;
a moment and asked:&#xD;
"Are you unwell father? You look ill I"&#xD;
"I'm not well my boy. I've spent a bad&#xD;
night-a bad night. I slept but little !"&#xD;
'You show it, Sir. had you not better&#xD;
go home and let me send for Doctor Root 7"&#xD;
No-no my boy, I don't need medicine,&#xD;
. or at least none of that kind. Besides I&#xD;
aven't time to be dick. I've business this&#xD;
&#xD;
RY AND POLICY DEALERS.                 69&#xD;
morning, important business ! You've the&#xD;
the key of the safe, have you not?2"&#xD;
"Yes, father."&#xD;
"Then get Inc a thousand dollars and a'-&#xD;
that we'll go up to the Bank Coffee house&#xD;
and try sonic of that old brandy, it will do&#xD;
me good I tkink."&#xD;
Charles Brennon stood for a moment in&#xD;
astonishment. Long as he had known Mr.&#xD;
Brent, he   never before knew   him  to&#xD;
either go into, or propose going into a&#xD;
liquor saloon. IIe had always said it was&#xD;
no place for a business man. lie had warn-&#xD;
ed Charles not to go to such places and now&#xD;
lie invited him there.  What a change&#xD;
And what was the cause of it?    -&#xD;
It was that he had taken the first step in&#xD;
crime when he had bought his first lottery&#xD;
ticket. He had then commenced to gamble&#xD;
-and the first step having been taken, the&#xD;
road was open and he knew not whcre to&#xD;
stop.&#xD;
Thatfirst step when man or woman de-&#xD;
viates from the right road, walks aside from&#xD;
the chalk-line of morality and honor, is a&#xD;
fearful one! It is worse than-a leap from a&#xD;
precipice which at once destroys life, flor it&#xD;
takes from life all that is im it worth pos-&#xD;
sessing. Thus, you will ever see, those who&#xD;
have taken the one step, dash madly on&#xD;
over the turn-pike of crime, never pausing&#xD;
until they reach the gallows, or are plunged&#xD;
in the irretrievable gulf of misery.&#xD;
Charles Brennon had taken that step, Mr.&#xD;
Brent had taken that step, Mr. Montrose had&#xD;
taken it, and destruction, utter ruin could&#xD;
be the only result. It is as useless to at-&#xD;
tempt to reform a gambler, as it is to rea-&#xD;
son with a drunken man, or try to 'set a&#xD;
river on fire with a pretty girl's greasy curl&#xD;
papers.&#xD;
And was it only upon themselves that&#xD;
they were bringing ruin? No-it was up-&#xD;
on their innocent famili s! Upon the good&#xD;
and pure "loved ones at home."&#xD;
Why do I write these line, what did good&#xD;
and honorable men pass laws against gam-&#xD;
blers and lottery dealers for?  To make&#xD;
money?    No i It was to protect the inno.&#xD;
cent who suffer from the crimes of the gull-&#xD;
.&#xD;

wild, mad shiek--the vessel was a w reck !&#xD;
Plank fromr plank was torn, and here and&#xD;

sate. But sad to say a monstrous sea came&#xD;
rolling on-a moment from our' view it&#xD;
veiled her form, she rose, but her poor babe&#xD;
was gone.&#xD;
They -seized her as she drifted in and&#xD;
bore her to the shore. "My child, my boy,"&#xD;
she cried, "oy angel and my pride ; obr&#xD;

men could not reply-a tear-drop filled&#xD;
each eye, and sadly, silently they looked&#xD;
out on the sea. She needed then no word to&#xD;

Another day had opened, fair and beauti-&#xD;
ful, the sun shone bright upon the spires of&#xD;
Trinity Church. The of'iciating pastor and&#xD;
his clerk were in the sacristy waiting the&#xD;
arrival of a wedding party. It was ncar&#xD;
noon, and at twelve the ceremony was to&#xD;
come oif which would unite Augustus Van-&#xD;
roy to Lydia Newbury and her sister to Mr.&#xD;
Dennison.&#xD;
As the hands upon the clock above poin&#xD;
ted to within five minutes, the carriage con&#xD;
taining the bridal party and their friends,&#xD;
drew up before the lofty edifice.   The&#xD;
groomsmen hastened to assist the ladies out.&#xD;
At that moment another carriage, contain&#xD;
ing a pallid female with one or two persomrs&#xD;
else, was approaching up Broadway. It ar-&#xD;
rived opposite the Church and at that mo-&#xD;
ment Augustus Vanroy was leading his be-&#xD;
trothed across the portals of the - sacred&#xD;
building. Then, from the lips of the pale&#xD;
creature in the coach arose a wild shriek,&#xD;
but he did not heed it, did not seem to hear&#xD;
it, for he passed on.&#xD;
But the carriage stopped.&#xD;

" Sultaitiaied? What do you mean?&#xD;

" No, but I doubt that your love will con-&#xD;

Tullius why so cruelly jest with a fond&#xD;
se'n-'itive heart ?"&#xD;
" Im not jesting Madam !''&#xD;
" Madam ? Why ever before you have&#xD;
called me Constance, your dear Constance.&#xD;
For heaven's sake tell me why is this&#xD;
change? Neither in word, or thought, or&#xD;

not need your services any further in theso&#xD;

"Not your wife ?" she gasped-" surely&#xD;
the minister was-"&#xD;

so Niss Monley you may as well take a final&#xD;
farewell of your temporary husband !"&#xD;
She did not shriek or faint, or weep, as&#xD;
the heroines of novels do, on such occasions.&#xD;
Her tall trm seemed to dilate, her eyer to&#xD;
enlrrge, and her red lips to pale as if frost&#xD;
had touched them. She looked a moment&#xD;
in his face and when she saw the villain&#xD;
quail before her earnest gaze, she tlt satis-&#xD;
fled of his guilt, of her own unintentional&#xD;
guilt and of her irrecoverable disgrace.-&#xD;
And then, while her eyes told him how sud-&#xD;
den is the change from fervent love to bit-&#xD;
ter hate, she spoke in a low whisper,&#xD;
Wretch, why have you so wronged me1"&#xD;
"To revenge the wrong your father cast&#xD;
.upon me. Now go, courtezan, go and mia-&#xD;

Catlin, like the riven oak I recognise my&#xD;
blasted hopes at a flash. "You may now&#xD;

Then while her eyes flashed and her form&#xD;
seemed still to grow larger and more beau-&#xD;

Vanroy.&#xD;

" The marriage broken off, how ?&#xD;
Vanroy again detailed the facts as he had&#xD;
already done, to Catlin.&#xD;

quietly to the narration, this match being&#xD;
broken off is rather hard for Vanroy, but&#xD;
the matter won't affect our lottery business&#xD;
in Boston !"&#xD;
" Why not? I can see nothing but ruin&#xD;
in it. Their exposure will ruin Vanroy,&#xD;

Grab produced the wine and over it the&#xD;
villainous trio not only recounted past ad-&#xD;
ventures but formed fresh plans for the&#xD;
future. Catlin stated that one love off his&#xD;
hands, he had only to turn his arts towards'&#xD;
Miss Montrose to make another conquest-&#xD;
while Grab said he cared nothing for love&#xD;
but all for money, and didn't see why he&#xD;
couldn't make it as well as a Beach or a&#xD;

A jolly time they had of it, and soon in&#xD;
the oblivious and dreamy vapors of wine&#xD;

menaced them.&#xD;
C1IAPTER~ XLVI.&#xD;
CoNSTANCe MoRLEY, when she left the&#xD;
office where justice should be administered,&#xD;
passed stern and stately up Broadway, un-&#xD;
heeding the admiring glances which many&#xD;
a promenader cast upon her magnificient&#xD;
figure. She was studying how to be re-&#xD;
venged upon her dastardly seducer. Poor&#xD;
and powerless in friends, knowing that she&#xD;
had wealth to war with, she was studying&#xD;
what course to pursue for upon revenge,&#xD;
and revenge alone, she tvas bent.&#xD;
She did not notice that she was closely&#xD;
followed by a man who was dressed in the&#xD;
height of fashon, though not exactly fop-pish-&#xD;
ly. He was alittle above the medium height,&#xD;
rather well made up, had eyes as dark as&#xD;
the door of night, heavy black whiskers&#xD;
and moustache. His face was pale but not&#xD;
intellectual. The animal evidently pre-&#xD;
dominated in his nature. Yet he was one&#xD;
that would not pass unnoticed in a crowd.&#xD;
There was a kind of bold, fierce expression&#xD;
in his countenance that would induce one&#xD;
who did not understand human nature to&#xD;
set him down as a brave man. Yet have I&#xD;
often, and most often seen calm, quiet&#xD;
looking men, who until aroused looked&#xD;
meek as lambs, the most dangerous in a&#xD;
fray, ready to lead the way where such&#xD;
men as him I have first described dare not&#xD;
go. And I may as well tell the reader at&#xD;
once that in him I only describe a person&#xD;
whom I know in this city. The last time I&#xD;
saw him it was in the dress circle of Bur-&#xD;
ton's theatre, with a lady by his side who&#xD;
was not only a faithless wife, but one who&#xD;
had deceived and wronged the truest friend&#xD;
she ever had on earth. She started, paled&#xD;
and trembled when she met my eye, for she&#xD;
knew that I knew all her history. She&#xD;

Because, Mr. Catlin, I abhor deceit. I&#xD;

been open to mue&#xD;
"l id he not require security, father, for&#xD;
every cent he loaned ?"&#xD;
" Yes, for we were strangers when I was&#xD;
deeply involved and I had to borrow from&#xD;
some source-I could not expect a favor&#xD;
without security. I mortgaged this house&#xD;
and its furniture to him. Since then he has&#xD;

Now reader for a new character in our&#xD;
book, one however that is tiue, the picture&#xD;
of a millionaire banker, whom you can&#xD;
sometimes see rolling down Wall street in&#xD;
his elegant carriage. here is his portrait.&#xD;
Seated in a large easy chair, cushioned&#xD;
and backed with velvet, his feet pilloved on&#xD;
an ottoman, you will observe a man atleast&#xD;
sixty years of age, though by his foppish&#xD;
dress he attempts to appear younger.&#xD;
His face was piple by the use of wines&#xD;
and liquors, his frame swelled, bloated and&#xD;
gouty from over-living. Ile wore a wig to&#xD;
conceal his baldness and Ballard's hair dye&#xD;
had been called into requisition to dye his&#xD;
eyebriows and whiskers. his redldeiled eyes,&#xD;
thick lips. and sensual expression betoken-&#xD;
ed his disposition. There he sat, robed in&#xD;
a stuffed and quilted morning gown of flow-&#xD;
ered satin, his gouty feet slippered in vel-&#xD;
vet, the personification of a wealthy old&#xD;
roue whose race of pleasure had become a&#xD;
painful tottering wreck toward the grave.&#xD;
The servant wlhoi we saw below, enter-&#xD;
ed and with a low obeisance handed his&#xD;
master the card Constance had sent up.&#xD;
A deeper flush caine over the red face of&#xD;
the millionaire as ie read the name-a&#xD;
chuckle gurgled out from his thick lips !&#xD;
"By the jolly God of Love-~it's her-I&#xD;
thought she'd accept my last offer, she's I&#xD;
a magnificent woman !"  Higgins, how do&#xD;

"Fine, sir, uncommonly fine!"&#xD;

lWith evident pain, assisted by the valet,&#xD;
the millionaire hobbled from the room.&#xD;
And now I am about to do what for the&#xD;
world I would not, were a lady in the case,&#xD;
enter a dressing room. I did, once, by the&#xD;
foolish miisiireetion of a stupid servant, get&#xD;
into a lady's dressing roots, but my stay&#xD;
was brik', I can tell you-I knew in an in-&#xD;
stait that I was in the wrong box. Ih/iear'd&#xD;
a faint sereafn and sew-xoINa! I left&#xD;
quicker than a rocket from a little boy's&#xD;

The dressing room we are about to visit&#xD;
is that of our millionaire. Look at it. See&#xD;
the cosmetics which load yonder table ;&#xD;
paints, white, red and black-here a wig,&#xD;
there a false set of teeth ; here pads for the&#xD;
legs, there pals to fill out the chest--back&#xD;
and front braces. supporters, &amp;amp;c. All kids&#xD;
of pomades, complexion renovators. Mir-&#xD;
rors surround the room. A lounge beside&#xD;
every bath. And yet how miserablelhe mil-&#xD;
lionaire who can command all these things,&#xD;
when compared with one of our penniless&#xD;
boys who can earn but a scanty living,whose&#xD;
cheeks are made rosy by exercise, but who&#xD;
with strong limbs, free from diseases, can&#xD;
leap into the flashing lake or river, and&#xD;
there in the God-given bath refresh himself&#xD;
after the hour of labor is over.&#xD;
Yes, see that old libertine hobble in on&#xD;
his gouty legs and between a grunt and a&#xD;

the same building- Upon a silver plate is&#xD;
neatly engraved a name, but it is not the&#xD;
real name of either the owner or the occu-&#xD;
&#xD;
pant. We will call the name Delorme for&#xD;
the nonce. Before this door a carriage&#xD;
stops-the driver and footman are liveried.&#xD;
The carriage door is opened, a lady close-&#xD;

carriage. to say who it is, for Constance&#xD;

The marriage moved away, and the two&#xD;
kemals etered a parlor whih was sepera-&#xD;
ted from the bar we have spoken of only by&#xD;
a door. After they got in, and Constance&#xD;
took a seat profferretl by the widow, she&#xD;
raised her veil.&#xD;
The latter looked as if she had expected&#xD;
to recognize an old acquaintance. But she&#xD;
was evidently disappointed.&#xD;

That I cannot reveal at present. You&#xD;
do not know me, but you do know one Tul-&#xD;

The widow started as if an adder had&#xD;
stung her to the heart. First her face was&#xD;
pale as snow, then red as fire.&#xD;
"Know    him--um'?" she cried-"yes,&#xD;
well do I know the cursed villain who he'&#xD;
trayed my poor husband and caused him to&#xD;
&#xD;
die in a felons cell where even I could not&#xD;
go to console him in his dying hour I If you&#xD;
are a friend of his, go, go from beneath my&#xD;
roof before I curse you as I have done&#xD;
him!"&#xD;
"Be calm Madame Delorme, I am not his&#xD;
friend, rather am I his deadliest foe. In me&#xD;
you behold one of his last victims. I have&#xD;
come here to seek aid to ruin and destroy&#xD;
him. I could kill him, but that will be no&#xD;
vengeance to me; I want him to die as your&#xD;
husband died-in a prison cell. I want to&#xD;
see him live as long as life and niserq meatn&#xD;
te same thing! You need not doubt me, I&#xD;
an a woman--women never deceive each&#xD;
other except when influenced by envy or&#xD;
jealousy. No one loves me, I love no one--&#xD;

"I do not Madam ; by what name may I&#xD;

Call me Constance, nothing else I"&#xD;
"I will: how can I serve you?"&#xD;
"You have a house which is used -s a ren.&#xD;
dezvous by a class of bold and reckless men,&#xD;
who thinking that the world owes them a&#xD;
living, (1o not scruple to take it 1"&#xD;
" How did you find it out?"&#xD;
"Because I accidentally heard a conver-&#xD;
sation which occurred between Catlin and&#xD;
one of your visitors, a man who himself&#xD;
seems to dislike  Catlin while he fears&#xD;
himl "&#xD;
Do you know his name'&#xD;
"I do not. He is a slender, dark-com-&#xD;
lrlexioned man, with a large scar on his brow&#xD;
,"tending down upon his right cheek."&#xD;
"Ah-I think I know this man. Come&#xD;
to the little wicket in the door here, and see&#xD;
if you can recognize hint among the men&#xD;
who are setting in onder room. You need&#xD;
not fear, they cannot see us here I"&#xD;
Constance did as she was desired, looking&#xD;
through a narrow aperture made by a slide&#xD;
in the door.&#xD;
"Yes, he is there' is the man nearest&#xD;
the window, who is emoking a cigar and&#xD;
reading a newspaper 1" she said.&#xD;
"I thought as much. That Lattson is a&#xD;
deep villain, but I think Catlin has got&#xD;
ahead of him about the proceeds of some&#xD;

haul. I heard him swear vengeance my-&#xD;
self!"&#xD;
"Can we trust him?"&#xD;
"Yes, if he has a motive. He can be in-&#xD;
flenced by money, or by a desire for re-&#xD;
venge !"&#xD;
"I have money, plenty of it, and will&#xD;
not spare it. Can you call hint in, that I&#xD;
may have an interview with him?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you desire it, but do not trust&#xD;
him too far, Lattson, is like all other vil-&#xD;
lains, used to crime, liable to  e used by&#xD;
the highest bidder f''&#xD;
"I will bid as high as any one-bring&#xD;
him in1"&#xD;
In a few moments the man who combined&#xD;
in himself the qualities of burglar, forger,&#xD;
and counterfeiter, entered the aparttett.&#xD;
He looked at Constance distrustfully. for&#xD;
he knew at a glance that she was a lady,&#xD;
and not one d~a class with whom he had&#xD;
been used to associate. She observed his&#xD;
embarrassment and at once proceeded to&#xD;
remove it.&#xD;
You need not fear me, Mr. Lattson,"&#xD;
she said, "I have cotie to get you to do&#xD;
me a favor, and ant willing to reward you&#xD;
for it !"&#xD;
Any thing in reason, Madame!  What&#xD;
do you want done ?"&#xD;
" You know   a fellow named Tullius&#xD;
Catlin ?"&#xD;
"D-n him, yes Madame!        Forgive&#xD;
me for swearing, but he is a bloody thief,&#xD;
without honor !"&#xD;
You know him to be a thief?"&#xD;
"Y Yes, Madam, and a receiver too-that's&#xD;
worse, forlhe hasn't the courage to crack a&#xD;
crib on his own hook !"&#xD;
"Can you prove it so that I can get him&#xD;
into States Prison, if I pay you well ?''&#xD;
"Why you see Ma'am, this peaching is&#xD;
rather aoainst my principle, besides if I did,&#xD;
I mignt get myself into trouble, for since&#xD;

of Charles lirennon ?&#xD;
Come with me into it once more-come&#xD;
  quickly for I hear the sound of a woman's&#xD;
pleading voice there, and the sound of men's&#xD;
voices uttering high and angry words.&#xD;
Look--there is poor Mary Brennon, hag-&#xD;
gard and worn. pale from terror, standing,&#xD;
between her father and her husband, trying&#xD;
to hold the latter back and to soothe him.&#xD;
Bothof the men are evidently in liquor,&#xD;
both too are tiushed with anger.&#xD;
"I repeat it !" cried the elder, " you&#xD;
have robbed meo-it is your fault, that I anl&#xD;

words, for with all his strength he hurled&#xD;

struck against the sharp corner of the mar-&#xD;

was standing under the shade of some trees&#xD;
a little beyond the North-eastern corner of&#xD;
Washington Parade Ground. The door was&#xD;
partly open and one or two persons were&#xD;
sitting inside of it. Loitering around, were&#xD;
several persons-and one or two were sit-&#xD;

Moore is within tire bounds of pr'obability, anid tlrefore worth as much alrga-r. 'fie author of&#xD;

Beautifully Illustrated. Price 50 Cents.&#xD;
"' This able writer has fairly imbued his mind with the historical facts of this famous period of&#xD;
history, and has formed accurate conceptions of the strange characters that clustered around&#xD;
the person of the English Sardanapalus-the witty but licentious Charles ii. But this book is no&#xD;
wories of dry historical details--it is an animated drama  The varied characters are presented&#xD;
to us inl such lively action, tiat the reader appears to mingle with the gay but guilty groups&#xD;
c bat peopled the gorgeous saloons of the merry monarch. We see the jovial Charles, laughter&#xD;
in his eye and jests upon his lips; the polished but heartless Rochester, ' who never said a fool-&#xD;
iih thing, and never did a good one ;' the merry, simple-hearted Nell Gwyne, the amorous, fasei-&#xD;
nating mistress of the king ; the Countess of Castlenmaine ; and the saturnine tyrant, James II.&#xD;
"The great interest of the plot-the developments of Court intrigues in lovc and politics-the&#xD;
perils and adventures of the hero and heroine of the story-the plots and counterplots of the&#xD;
Cavaliers and Roundhcads, and the strange incidents that befel the ' Merry Monarch' in his&#xD;
wanderings among the roughest of his subjects, form the groundwork of one of the best book&#xD;
we have lately been called upon to notice."-.Morning Star.&#xD;

IN the course of this great Romance, SUE, (while he adds much to the interest of the1&#xD;

AND TIlE GALLEY, AND THE WOMEN TO PROS.-&#xD;

While it is entirely free from any offensive thoughts or language, it unveils the terrible&#xD;
social evils that are&#xD;
GANGRENING THE VERY HEART OF THE FRENCH SOciEPy.&#xD;
Never has genius conceived or described more interesting characters than those which im&#xD;
part to this story the animation of real life. The bold, handsome, but cruel and licentious&#xD;
('clonel do Plournel-the stern, frigid, jesuitical Cardinal-the lovely and virtuous daugh.&#xD;

run down " The Mysteries of tne People," but when we assure our readers that it was this&#xD;
tale which won for Eugene Sue his election as Member forl Paris in the beginning of May,&#xD;

" Quintin Matsys ; or The Blacksmith of Antwerp. "-The romantic history&#xD;
of the great Flemish Painter, whom love removed fiom the anvil to the easel,&#xD;
presents such capital points for the pen of romance that it would be next to im-&#xD;
possible to construct an uninteresting story out such good material.  The author&#xD;
of this book has worked up his lot with ingenuity and power  The language is&#xD;
chaste and elegant, and the tale so fasenating that it holds the reader's mind&#xD;
with firm grap until its perusal is finished.-Phihu/e/lphia Sunday Despatch.&#xD;
Quintin Matsys; or The Blacksmith of Antwerp "-This is a tale of what is&#xD;
called the dark or middle age, daing from the beginning of the thirteenth centu-&#xD;
ry, when superstition and might were the only governing principles. At this time&#xD;
a sl  ty was formed to protect the weak against the strong, which was called&#xD;
" F hm Geriehte," and the terror of that band was felt throughout Germany.-&#xD;
N, person could commit a crime or plunder his neighbor, but retributive justice&#xD;
woul 1 overtake him. It is a truly thrilling work.  Published by Garrett &amp;amp; Co.,&#xD;

This is a reprint, and one of tlv most thrilling, romantic and fascinating ste&#xD;
that has found its way to the public heart and mind from any quarter. It is fu&#xD;
of dramatic action-portraying every variety of thought and feeling, and compares&#xD;
fvorably with the best modern novels. Indeed it is among the best ever written&#xD;
