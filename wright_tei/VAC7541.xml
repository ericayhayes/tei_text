THE EMPRESS OF THE ISLES; ;ON&#xD;
&#xD;
During the summer months, this cleared portion of the little islet is&#xD;
clothed with a luxuriant growth of red and white clover, the grateful&#xD;
aroma of which is borne by the soft summer winds for miles away&#xD;
among the intricacies of a hundred narrow, winding channels of neigh-&#xD;
boring islands.&#xD;
Such is Linda's Island, one of the most lovely of all that celebrated&#xD;
group which stun the bosom of. the mighty St. I awrentee, and are-known&#xD;
to travellers as the "Thousand Islands."&#xD;
There is a sad story-almost a legend now-of this little gem of the&#xD;
St. Lawren'ce, which I will tell you just as I have heard it a hundred&#xD;
times from the people at French Croek and many of the farmers living&#xD;
along the river near the island.&#xD;
Early one morning in the month of May, 1817, a schooner, bound&#xD;
down the river, stopped at French Greek, and landed a delicate, fair-&#xD;
haired girl, with several heavy trunks, and then immediately got under&#xD;
weigh again, and proceeded on her voyage. The girl was apparently&#xD;
about eighteen, very richly dressed, and a total stranger to everybody&#xD;
in the village, and of course everybody wondered what on earth she had&#xD;
come there for. But it was soon ascertained that the stranger had&#xD;
money, which was sufficient to make her a welcome visitor among the&#xD;
simple-minded villagers, and invest her with an air of importance, par-&#xD;
ticularly with the proprietor of the village inn, of whom she engaged&#xD;
rooms for an indefinite period, and paid him a quarter's rent nd 'boat'd&#xD;
in advance,411 in gold.&#xD;
Within three weeks from the morning that the beautiful youn&#xD;
stranger landed at Frenoh Creek, a rumor Went abroad that she hag&#xD;
purchased from a farmer, who had previously inhabited it, the little&#xD;
island, and was having a small cottage built near the willow basin, as it&#xD;
was called; which she intended as her future residence. People learned&#xD;
that the deed of the property amid the contract for the building ofthe&#xD;
cottage'were made in the naine'of Linda 'Morris. but that was all they&#xD;
knew of the mysterious stranger; only that she was young, beautiful as&#xD;
an angel, and always wore an  lr' of settled melancholy, almost of&#xD;
anguish, upon her ehlild-like featpr-es,'as if some bitter grief was paying&#xD;
upon her heart ; and when some two. months' had gone' by from the&#xD;
morning that she first -made her appearance among them, the cottage&#xD;
was completed, and she removed to her fairy islet; the heart's best&#xD;
affections of all went with her ; for all, old and young, loved the gentle&#xD;
being. and the older inhabitants of I the 'illage,those who knew her&#xD;
best, shook their heads ominously wheu they spoke of her, and often&#xD;
said--&#xD;
"Alas! poor girl, she is dying of a broken heart."&#xD;
These 'expressions were prophetic ;,for one cold December's afternoon,&#xD;
more than five months after the young recluse had taken up her lone&#xD;
residence in the willow Cottage, as people called' it, a hunter, who had&#xD;
followed a deer over on the' ice to;'the island, camerto the village of&#xD;
French Creek with a message for the''doctor, a good old man far past&#xD;
the prime of manhood, another for the minister, and yet another'for&#xD;
Mrs. Allen, a poor widow of the village, with whom Linda -had' been&#xD;
very intimate during her reside'ee at t"e inn, requeting 'them to oeto&#xD;
oirr to the island immediately.' The 'suiimmons waf promptly obeyed,&#xD;

and when they returned to the village, after an absence of four 'days, it&#xD;
was with sad faces and sadder hearts, for they brought the intelligence&#xD;
that-the beautiful recluse, 4&amp;amp;Linda of'the Islana,"- was dead !&#xD;
Within three bourseafter their arrival at the cottage, she had given&#xD;
birth to a male child, which she confided to the care of the widow, and&#xD;
then, after imparting her secret to the two kind-hearted old men. and&#xD;
the foster mother of her new-born babe, she lingered along, hovering&#xD;
as it were' upon 'the very brink of the grave, for almost four days&#xD;
longer, when her gentle spirit took its flight to a holier, better world.&#xD;
Two days after .lhis sad event, the whole population of the village&#xD;
were assembled at the island cottage, and with a deep solemnity be-&#xD;
fitting the -occasion, the body of Linda Morris was consigned to the&#xD;
grave, in a spot she had herself chosen, under a venerable old willow,&#xD;
only a few steps from the cottage.&#xD;
'The curiosity and excitement consequent upon an event of so extra-&#xD;
ordinary a nature, gradually subsided-the secreti-etiained fastdocked&#xD;
in the bosoms of those to whom it had been confided- and at length,&#xD;
-when the spring came again, and the Widow Allen removed from&#xD;
'French: Creek to parts unknown, taking with her the infant which had&#xD;
been entrusted to her care, people began to think that the 'mystery&#xD;
would always remain a mystery, and so dismissed it as much as possi-&#xD;
ble from their thoughts.&#xD;
The cottage remained unoccupied for nearly a year 'after the death&#xD;
of Linda, when it was accidentally set on fire by some drunken fisher.&#xD;
men, and totally consumed. The good old minister of the village held&#xD;
possession'of the island, by virtue of some writing which he 'had re-&#xD;
ceived from the recluse: and as he would allow no one to settle upon&#xD;
it, or cultivate the soil, it remained for years just as it was at the death&#xD;
of its mysterious proprietor, except that the cottage was destroyed, as&#xD;
already mentioned.&#xD;
Such is the story, legend, or what you will, of Linda's Island;' and&#xD;
such, very nearly as I have described it, was the appearance of the&#xD;
delightful little islet at the time our story opens, which is in the&#xD;
month of May, 1837. ,&#xD;
C  *           C      *       *  .   *&#xD;
It was within an hour of noon, on one of the most gloriously beauti-&#xD;
ful May mornings that ever dawned upon the magnificent scenery of&#xD;
the St. Lawrence, that a noble steamer, on her downward course, stop-&#xD;
pod for a few moments abreast of the little promontory at the western&#xD;
end of the island, to land a solitary passenger, who, leaping from the&#xD;
bow of the yawl as she neared 'the white-pebbled beach, turned and&#xD;
waved an adieu with his hand to a group.of fellow-voyagers that had&#xD;
assembled near the steamer's gang-way to bid him farewell.&#xD;
The steamer went on her way again, and for full fifteen minutes the&#xD;
lone passenger stood there dn the beach with his gaze bent upon the&#xD;
forms and faces of friends, perhaps, on her deck, till they grow indis-&#xD;
tinct in the dim 'distance, and finally the steamer herself was lost to&#xD;
view in the narrow winding channel among the green islands below the&#xD;
town-of Clayton.&#xD;

drama which is to follow, and as we havefa moat admirable view ofhim&#xD;
as he stands there watching the receding steamer, W4 may as well  -&#xD;
impress his form and features upon -our minds, so that we ,may be&#xD;
enabled to recognize him again at a glance, whenever and wherever&#xD;
we may chance to meet' him; and meet .him again we. shall, rnost&#xD;
assuredly, and often too, before another year has gone by.&#xD;
You can see, as he stands there leaning lightly upon the muzzle' of&#xD;
a heavy rifle, highly ornamented with silver mountings, the breech of&#xD;
which he has -dashed impatiently down into the loose gravel of the&#xD;
beach, burying it almost to the look ; that he is young, so young that&#xD;
you are certain he cannot yet have counted his twentieth birth-day ;&#xD;
still it is a form and face of perfect manhood. l:s broad chest, and&#xD;
muscular, well-rounded limbs, tell of uncommon strength and ;activity;&#xD;
his face is very handsome and exquisitely fair, almost too fair for a&#xD;
man, and yet there is nothing feminine in its expression. The features,&#xD;
as you view them in profile, are of the true Grecian cast ; the mouth '&#xD;
is perhaps a trifle too large to be in strict harmony with the otherwise&#xD;
perfect features; but the rich red lips, slightly parted, disclosing the&#xD;
small even teeth, beautifully white, takes from the mouth every appear.-&#xD;
ance of vulgarity. -His eyes are dark, and, lit up as they are by the&#xD;
bright warm sunlight, show as intensely blue as the -fathomless depths&#xD;
of old St. Lawrence's waters on a calm summer's evening. The deli-&#xD;
cate arched brows,.and long silken lashes, an Andalusian beauty would&#xD;
envy, and his hair-ohI we -can never tell its exact color. We can&#xD;
only see that it is of that glorious sunny hue that changes with every&#xD;
flash of sunlight-that glossy golden tint so peculiar to Austria's high.&#xD;
born-dames ; and then its slight inclination to curl gives it that grace.&#xD;
ful, wavy appearance so much admired by all, and which would cause a,&#xD;
Spanish maiden to fall in love with it and its wearer at the first'&#xD;
glance.    ~&#xD;
His costume, you will observe, is half nautical in its fashion and&#xD;
material, consisting of light duck trousers, spotlessly white; a close-&#xD;
fitting jacket of fine blue cloth, ornamented with a profusion of small&#xD;
braid buttons set in double rows on the breast, and up the slashed&#xD;
cuffs almost to the elbow. His head is covered with a blue cloth cap,&#xD;
such as is worn'by midshipmen in the English navy, while a delicate&#xD;
scarf is knotted negligently about his handsome throat, the ends falling&#xD;
down on his breast and half concealing the bosom of a beautifully&#xD;
enbroidered shirt, the collar of which you see is open and turned-down&#xD;
over that of his jacket, thereby adding greatly to his juvenile ap-&#xD;
pearance.&#xD;
For a few moments after the steamer went out of sight among the&#xD;
islands, the youthful stranger remained there leaning thoughtfully&#xD;
upon his rifle, with his eyes wandering over the gorgeous picture before&#xD;
him ; and then, as if suddenly recollecting that he had visited the&#xD;
island for other purposes than to stand there upon the beach and gaze&#xD;
out upon the splendid river scenery, he took his way along the bank&#xD;
of the little inlet, at a rapid pace, until his quick eye caught a glimpse&#xD;
of a white marble slab, peeping up from amid a little wilderness of&#xD;
wild flowers and blooming roses that grew in native luxuriance -about.&#xD;
a lone grave under an old. willow near the eastern border of a -tiny&#xD;
&#xD;
fakelet, when be , sprang forward with a bound as fleet as that of=the&#xD;
wild gazelle until he gained the headstone, and then eagerly putting&#xD;
aside the foliage, he beat down and read-.&#xD;
LINDA MORRIS,&#xD;
DIED DECEMBER 21; 1817,&#xD;
. D 19.&#xD;
My mother !" exclaimed the 'young stranger, as he sank to hIs&#xD;
knees in an attitude of prayer, and bowed his head upon the grassy&#xD;
mond. For many minutes he had remained there in silent and holy&#xD;
communion with the dead, when he was suddenly aroused by the low&#xD;
flutedike- tonea of a :female voice singing a plaintive requiem; and&#xD;
looking up from- the grave, he discovered a young girl so gloriously&#xD;
beautiful that she seemed rather a bright being from the spirit world&#xD;
than *a creation, of earth, like a second Lady of the Lake. guiding with&#xD;
skilful hand a fairy skiff along through the quiet waters of the sylvan&#xD;
lakelet, heading her tinycraft for the shore nearest the lone grave.&#xD;
Tn n transport of wonder, doubt and amazement, the enraptured youth&#xD;
stood there as if spell-bound, gazing upon the enchanting vision, grow-&#xD;
ing brighter and lovelier each moment in all the glowing charms of her&#xD;
magic beauty, as the weird skiff approached the shore.&#xD;
Lightly the beautiful creature stepped forth from her little bark as&#xD;
it ranged up alongside a clump of willows that grew down to the very&#xD;
edge of the water, and taking up a basket of wild flowers which she&#xD;
had brought with her, she left the beach and began to ascend the bank&#xD;
by an abrupt path that led from the water up to the lone grave-; but&#xD;
era she had gained one quarter of the distance, a fierce looking ruffian&#xD;
sprang up from a little thicket of briars and tangled vines that skirted&#xD;
the path, and snatching up the maiden in his arms, he bounded away&#xD;
with her in- spite of her utmost struggles and frantic cries for help,&#xD;
towardsa dense mass of willows that grew on the beach at a distance&#xD;
perhaps of a dozen rods from the shore.     4-      -&#xD;
" Lost ! lost !" shrieked the despairing girl, as the thicket was&#xD;
gained, and her eye fell upon a beautiful sail-boat, which had been so&#xD;
artfully concealed by the green branches that she had not discovered&#xD;
it when she passed a few moments previously in her own skiff.&#xD;
" There's where you are entirely mistaken," replied the miscreant,&#xD;
in a cold, sneering tone ; " it strikes inc that you are just found, for&#xD;
here I've been waiting for you to visit the island these three days ;&#xD;
but you came very near giving me the slip after all. Do you know I&#xD;
was fast asleep there till your singing aroused me?  Why, if you&#xD;
hadn't been quite so musical, you would have got away altogether, and&#xD;
I should have lost my two hundred pounds, which I am to have for&#xD;
carrying you off."&#xD;
" Two hundred pounds for carrying me off?' inquired the astonished&#xD;
girl, becoming suddenly calm; "and may I be permitted to know who&#xD;
it is that has employed you to commit this ruffianly act ?"&#xD;
.' 0, certainly, Miss, there's no harm in your knowing, as you won't&#xD;
be very likely to get away and give the alarm. You must know that&#xD;
the Colonial Government has been trying to get hold of your father.&#xD;

de it: --And now Sir Francis'thinks that if he once gets you safeu-&#xD;

" Oliver Shephard is a rnost consummate scoundrel !" said a bold,&#xD;
manly voice, which caused tle' astonished kidnapper to relinquish his&#xD;
grasp upon the girl, who sprang away beyond the reach of his arm with&#xD;
a foot as fleet as that of a frightened fawn.&#xD;
The burly wretch cast a single indignant glance at the intruder,-and&#xD;
then made a motion as if to dart upon his vie-tio again. ' He made-but&#xD;
a single step, however ; for a grasp of iron was laid upon his shoulder.&#xD;
and held' him back.&#xD;
With a violent effort the villain shook off his assailant, and for nearly&#xD;
a minute he stood there with" flashing eyes. gazing in silence. upon the&#xD;
manly form of the young stranger-him whom we have so lately seen'&#xD;
kneeling there beside the lone grave. - At length he spoke:&#xD;
aStanley Morris,-what meddling fiend has sent you hither I  But&#xD;
four days since I left you on board your ship in Kingston."  -&#xD;
":Were you to inquire what angel had guided me to this spot, me-&#xD;
thinks the question, were more readily answered," rejoined the young&#xD;
man.-&#xD;
"Then may I ask by what right you presume to interfere between&#xD;
me and yonder girl, whom, as you are well aware, I am commissioned,&#xD;
by Sir Francis Bransley himself, to seize and carry off ?"&#xD;
" By the divine right of common humanity, which teaches MAN every-&#xD;
where to protect a helpless woman against brute violence."&#xD;
" Do you know who I am ?" shouted the now aroused ruffian.&#xD;
" Aye, I do, Oliver Shephard ; I have known you long, as the base&#xD;
spy of a corrupt government; and now' I know you better as a vile&#xD;
tool of a viler master.",                                     .&#xD;
'" I have no time or disposition to bandy words with you ! my busi-&#xD;
ness is with yonder girl."- And the spy, as. we have just heard the&#xD;
young man call hin i made another single step towards the trembling&#xD;
maiden, and again the fearless champion stood in his path.&#xD;
" Oliver Shephard," said the boy-stranger, as calmly as if no breath&#xD;
of passion stirred his blood, go back to those who sent you, and tell&#xD;
them such a tale as you;knew well how to invent, of your defeat; but&#xD;
dare to lay= your~polluting hand again upon that pure being. and by-the-&#xD;
blue vault of Heaven, I'll send your felon soul to the keeping of the&#xD;
foul fiends !"..&#xD;
In an instant the villain's hands were upon the butts of a brace of&#xD;
pistol that protruded from -within the bosom of his vest; but before&#xD;
he could draw them forth, he was hut-led backwards full ten fea from&#xD;
the beach into the water. When he- regained the shore, his pistols&#xD;
were in no very serviceable condition, and a single glance at his antago-&#xD;
nist, who stood there at a little distance; squinting with one eye along-&#xD;
the tube of the deadly rifle aimed at his head, convinced him that he&#xD;
was in a particularly unhealthy neighborhood, and within three-min-&#xD;
utes he bad his boat under full sail, standing down 'through the little&#xD;
inlet, leaving his victorious enemy and the rescued muaiden in peace-&#xD;
able possession of the island.&#xD;

CHAPTER II&#xD;
A MUTUAL INTRODUcTION--AN HOUR'S CONVERSATION AT TIIE GRAVE--&#xD;
THE VISIT TO CLAYTON--TnE FAREWELL.&#xD;
In early youth, when hope is new&#xD;
The heart expands with iove and joy;&#xD;
Each prospect wears a brighter hue,&#xD;
And pleasure seems without alloy.&#xD;
WITH all the trusting innocence of a very child--and, indeed. she&#xD;
was scarcely more--the beautiful girl approached the youthful stran-&#xD;
ger. and clasping his arm with both her delicate little hands, she looked&#xD;
up into his face con6dingly, as she poured forth her thanks for his gal-&#xD;
lant interference-in her behalf. He must have been an anchorite, in-&#xD;
deed. who could have-stood there unmoved, amnd gazed upon that glori-&#xD;
ous vision of female loveliness. Pygmalion himself. when kneeling at&#xD;
the shrine of his own magic art, beheld not a creature of such faultless&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
Certainly not more than sixteen summers could have dawned upon&#xD;
her young existence. and yet Time seemed to have forestalled his own&#xD;
work. in perfecting thus early the matchless splendor of her glowing&#xD;
charms. Her's was that divine style of idealized beauty that might&#xD;
have characterized the far-famed Cecelia of Carlo Dolce, could the won-&#xD;
drous picture have stepped forth from the.canvas, invested with living&#xD;
breathing humanity.&#xD;
But this is only a sort of dreamy, poetical description, which, if you-&#xD;
happen to be any way particular or obstinate upon such subjects, you&#xD;
will very likely pretend that you don't half understand; wherefore&#xD;
permit me. in'a few words of plain, sober prose, to picture our future&#xD;
heroine, divested of half the romance with which the occasion has in-&#xD;
vested her.&#xD;
She was a dark brunette, somewhat below the medium stature even&#xD;
of a girl of sixteerr, slender in form. but of such exquisite proportions&#xD;
that, in gazing upon her. classic features and Hebe-like figure, you&#xD;
seemed to forget that she was petite, and the sylph grew mysteriously&#xD;
before your eyes into a magnificent woman. Her hair and bright,&#xD;
sparkling eyes were black as night, and-- and  - pshaw! Read&#xD;
th~e graphic description-of Di Vernon, and you will understand exactly&#xD;
whatI wish to-say of the little island beauty.&#xD;
After having thanked the young man with a warmth of expression&#xD;
which showed that the best feelings of her heart accompanied her&#xD;
words, the gentle girl led her companion back to the spot where she&#xD;
had been surprised by the ruffian, and taking from the ground the&#xD;
basket of flowers which she had let fall in the first moment of her&#xD;
fright, she pointed significantly towards the grave, and arm in arm they&#xD;
ascended the bank together. -&#xD;

Ere they reached the grassy mound, a mutual self-introduction took&#xD;
plaoe between them. The maiden learned that he who had so nobly&#xD;
rescued her from the clutches of the ruffian, was the child of the recluse,&#xD;
whose story she was familiar with. Ten days previously, he informed&#xD;
her that his mother, or her.he had ever known as such, died in Kings-&#xD;
ton, and on her death-bed she had revealed to him the secret of his true&#xD;
parentage, and all the particulars of his mother's death, her burial&#xD;
there on the little island, and also placed in his. lands many papers&#xD;
which had been entrusted to her by his mother, among which was one&#xD;
giving an account of the cause which induced her to take up her abode-&#xD;
on the island, and another, the original deed of the island itself in his&#xD;
mother's name.&#xD;
After the funeral of his foster mother, he obtained leave of absence&#xD;
from the ship he was attached to as a midshipman, for the purpose of&#xD;
visiting his mother's grave, and he had not been more than an hour on&#xD;
the island when the scene occurred as'already related, between the&#xD;
villain Shephard and= himself.&#xD;
On the other hand, Stanly Morris, as we shall henceforth know Mm,&#xD;
learned that the beautiful maiden by his side; and leaning so confid-&#xD;
ingly upon his arm, was the daughter of William Johnson, or, as he&#xD;
was more familiarly'known about the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario,&#xD;
Bill Johanson, or the Pirate of the Lakes, which reputation he had-earned&#xD;
partly.from the fact, that during the war of 181S2 he'bad made himself,&#xD;
obnoxious to the British and Colonial Governments, by destroying two&#xD;
of their armed vessels in their own waters, almost under the very guns of&#xD;
their forts ; intercepting their mails, and transmitting to thi American&#xD;
Commander such information as led to the capture of Toronto, (then&#xD;
little York;) but more especially had .he become an object of venge-&#xD;
ance to the authorities of what was then Upper Canada, by his success.&#xD;
ful and daring career for more than twenty years, as a smuggler on the&#xD;
St. Lawrence and Ontario.&#xD;
For fifteen years there had been a standing reward in Kingston of&#xD;
one Abousand pounds sterling, for the apprehehsion- and delivery into&#xD;
the hands of the law, of the notorious Bill Johnson, and many were the&#xD;
artful schemes and projects entered into by his -personal enemies and&#xD;
those who sought the reward, to get possession of his person. But all&#xD;
their plans had been rende ed abortive .by his consummate cunning&#xD;
bnd personal prowess; and so, up to the time that our story commences,&#xD;
Bill Johnson had lived there on a littly rocky island, do near to the&#xD;
village of French Creek that it was connected to the main land by a&#xD;
rude wooden bridge, keeping A kind of obscure inn or boarding house&#xD;
for-sailors, a quiet, peaceable citizen of the United States, and carrying&#xD;
tn 'his extensive contraband trade, by means of several large, fast.&#xD;
.saihing boats, with several of the obscure out-of-the-way ports on the&#xD;
-Qanadian side of the St. Lawrence, which is here some miles wide.&#xD;
But after all, Bill Johnson had a hundred true friends where he had&#xD;
one enemy, both in the United States and Canada ; and Stanly Morris&#xD;
had heard so much of the genuine kindness of heart. and noble gene-&#xD;
rositYrefvthe bold smuggler,.that he seemed 4o him n'pattern of all that&#xD;
waspbrave and good,; .and when he learned that the glorious creature&#xD;
-beside him was the daughter of a man he so w h admired, be somehow&#xD;

T.HE LAKE BRAVO. I-&#xD;
let as if she wae rather sister, or an acquaintance whom he had log&#xD;
knsorn,than an entirestranger whom he had just met for the first&#xD;
time. And then, as they reached his mother's grave, and the gentle,&#xD;
irl proceeded to twine her garland of freshaculled flowers around the&#xD;
lone head-stone, the whole truth of her angel mission flashed across his&#xD;
minsI, and he silently invoked the choicest blessings of the Almighty&#xD;
-Qpd upon the fair being who thus sought to beautify the last resting&#xD;
plcae of the stranger dead.&#xD;
As for the maiden, she had heard so much and so often, from her me-&#xD;
thier anud hundred others of the villager of " Linda," the recluse and her&#xD;
death and burial there on the little island, that she learned to love the&#xD;
Jeep solitude of the spot; and often in spring and early summer would&#xD;
-she gather her basket of flowers, and paddle away in her fairy skiff over&#xD;
to the island, where she would spend whole hours in decorating- the&#xD;
grave, half dreaming the while, and wondering what could be the fate&#xD;
of Linda's child. so that when at last she had so unexpectedly met the&#xD;
very child of whom she had'so often thought and- dreamed, it did not&#xD;
appear to her:as if he was an entire stranger whom she had never seen&#xD;
before ; and when her task was ended, the. last flower from her basket&#xD;
had been deposited upon the grave, or twined -about the marble slab,&#xD;
she sat down beside him there, under the old willow, and for a whole&#xD;
hour they conversed upon a variety of subjects as familiarly as if they&#xD;
had known each other all their lives.&#xD;
At length they were aroused by the loud plashing of. a steamer's&#xD;
paddles, as she passed close along by the island on her upward course,&#xD;
and the maiden observing it was growing late, invited her companion&#xD;
to accompany her on her return to. the village,&#xD;
He accepted the invitation, and soon the light skiff, propelled by&#xD;
his vigorous arm, was cleaving the bright, blue waters of the St.&#xD;
Lawrence, towards the village of French Creek, some three miles&#xD;
distant.&#xD;
;   -     "Who in the world is that handsome young sailor Kate Johnson has&#xD;
got with her ?" inquired a half-dozen idlers in front of a grocery near&#xD;
the little wharf, where Stanly had just made the skiff fast. The ques-&#xD;
tion, or something equivalent to it, was repeated by a dozen old woman,&#xD;
as many rosy-cheeked maidens, and twice that number of bare-footed&#xD;
boys. hs the young couple passed along through the village, towards the&#xD;
residence of the good old minister, (now .almost helpless in his extreme&#xD;
p pge.) who had been present at the death of Stanly's mother, and who&#xD;
had ever-since that held possession of the island which bore her name.&#xD;
But the oftrrepeated question remained unanswered, for not a soul in&#xD;
the whole village had ever seen the young man before; and so they&#xD;
A      continued to guess and wonder, while, altogether regardless of the&#xD;
remarks that now and then reached their ears, the pair passed on till&#xD;
they reached the parsonage, into which they entered, and where; much&#xD;
to the astonishment of the old minister, the beautiful girl introduced&#xD;
her companion as Stanly Morris, the son of the recluse; after which&#xD;
she immediately took her departure for home, promising, however, to&#xD;
return at n early hour in the evening, and escortt her new friend to&#xD;
her father's -house, as she -was anxious to introduce him to her parents.&#xD;

TIM ' E P1U5S O TUERISLES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
that afternoon is a secret, and were it known, it would' be altogether&#xD;
unimportant in our story; but certain it is that the secret of his name&#xD;
and the circumstance of his having so bravely defended the beautiful&#xD;
girl against the 'brutal ruffian that day on the island; had' gone like wild&#xD;
'fire through the village; for when he left the parsonage at sun-down,&#xD;
in- company with Kate, who had come thus early to conduct him to her&#xD;
home,-he was everywhere greeted by the warm-hearted villagers, as the&#xD;
champion of Kate'Johnson, the universal favorite and pet of all, young&#xD;
and old, wherever she was known. Old men and women, too, a few&#xD;
there.were, who remembered his fair-haired, beautiful mother, and her&#xD;
sad fate,:and these came forth into the street, took him kindly by the&#xD;
hand, and welcomed him to the village as warmly as if he were some&#xD;
-near and dear relative-just returned from a long voyage. But-all-these&#xD;
welcomes and greetings were trifles compared to those he received from&#xD;
the parents, brothers, and only sister of the beautiful Kate. .The little&#xD;
beauty had told the story-of his gallant conduct in her own glowing&#xD;
language, and their gratitude when he appeared among them was&#xD;
unbounded.   Old Bill, a-"very giant in stature, caught him in his&#xD;
brawny arms and hugged him to his heart, with a grasp like that of a&#xD;
polar bear ; his wife, a quiet lady-like woman, hung there with her&#xD;
arms about the young sailor's neck. and head bowed upon his bosom,,&#xD;
sobbing like a child, while two of: the brothers, almost as hercule~an as&#xD;
their father in proportions, wrung his hands so fiercely that he was&#xD;
almost ready' to cry out with pain ; and Kate's sister, the gentle Har-&#xD;
riet, stood timidly gazing upon the group, almost wishing that it had&#xD;
been herself that the handsome youth had nobly rescued from the&#xD;
power of the vile miscreant, Shephard.&#xD;
At length Kate, probably fearing that tlhey would smother or pull&#xD;
him to pieces, interposed her authority, and drew him away to a seat&#xD;
beside herself, when an animated conversation ensued,'the condition&#xD;
of the Canadas were freely discussed, and as the popular feeling along&#xD;
our whole frontier was at, that time enlisted in favor of a rebellion or&#xD;
revolution, which was every day expected to break out in Canada, Old&#xD;
Bill felt - considerable curiosity, or it may be anxiety, to know which&#xD;
side his young guest, would be in favor of when the struggle came, as&#xD;
come it would before long; and in the course of the conversation, he&#xD;
made the inquiry.&#xD;
" Had the question been asked me ten days ago," replied the young&#xD;
officer,' I would have told you, without a moment's hesitation, that I&#xD;
would remain firm in the cause of government. I have held a warrant&#xD;
in the navy for nearly four years, and have no reason to be dissatisfied&#xD;
either with the service or government. Three weeks since I passed&#xD;
my examination and received a lieutenant's commission, supposing, of&#xD;
coarse, as did the board that passed me, that I was born a British&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
" But when the good old woman, whom I had always known as my&#xD;
mother, died, and' I was made aquainted with the secret of my birth-&#xD;
when I learned that the old ,lady had assumed the name of Morris at&#xD;
the request of my real mother, and that I was an American born-I&#xD;
determined to visit my mother's grave, and then return to Kingston&#xD;

There is no lamp burning within the apartment, but by the last&#xD;

that the female s young-almost a child in years, and beautiful as an&#xD;

chiseled features are marked with traces of sorrow, and as she sits there&#xD;
as motionless as a marble statue, gazing out upon the lawn and alo g&#xD;
down the winding road, her bosom heaves as if with some powerful&#xD;
emotion, and a half-suppressed sigh escapes her parted lips.&#xD;

are laying plans to get his pretty daughter into your's. I am foiled in&#xD;

to pay over the two hundred pounds, but send me up here after this&#xD;

off yourself. To-morrow .I will make a demand on the colonel for the&#xD;
whole amount, and if be refusesI am inclined to think that a hint&#xD;
from we concerning a -certain Mrs. Moody .and two children in Eng-&#xD;

re'iind him of a marriage ceremony that took.place at Hamilton some&#xD;
twenty monthssince, between a young lady of that town and a certain&#xD;
Col. Mooy of the Royal Rifles: But I must be off, for -1 remember&#xD;
the girl said she expected her brother home within three hours, and if&#xD;
he should chance to find me here in his grounds, I fear I should fare&#xD;

who, if I mistake not, will find---'&#xD;
"fHellpa !- shipmate, aint you out your reckoning, eruisin' about here&#xD;
in Capt. Ben's grounds ?"&#xD;
" Good evening, sir," said the disguised stranger, (whom the reader&#xD;
has doubtless recognized as the ruffian Oliver Shephard,) without, how-&#xD;
,ever, replying to the question which had been thus suddenly put to him&#xD;
by a genuine specimen of an English sailor, who came rolling in through&#xD;
he open gate with a regular sea-going swagger, that not one landsman&#xD;
out of five hundred could imitate successfully.&#xD;
- " Good evenin,'-shipmate," replied the sailor. "But I say, didn't I&#xD;
hear ye saying' summit about Stanly Morris just as I up helm and&#xD;
squared away down -through. theogate; here ?"&#xD;
"It isavery probable that you did," responded the spy; '(-Lieutenant&#xD;
orris has been arrested .and imprisoned on the charge of having&#xD;
recently visited French Creek, and plotting with the notorious pirate&#xD;
fill.Johnson, against the peace of the Colonial Government."-&#xD;
. "Avast ! there, shipmate," broke in the sailor, "I know all that are&#xD;
lingo, and know too that Stanly Morris is just as -innocent of anything&#xD;
against this government, as that -little angel inside o' Capt. Ben's cot-&#xD;
tage there. It's all the 'doin's o' that infernal sneakin shark Oliver&#xD;

- deserted her happy,. quit home in company with that British officer,&#xD;
wvas Edith Letts; and it is proper to remark here, that she, with a&#xD;
brother some three years older than herself, were the survivors of their&#xD;
family. _ Their parents had both been dead for more than five.years,&#xD;
leaving to=their children, Benjamin and Edith, more than thirty thou-&#xD;
sand pounds, in bank stock ,and money, together with one of the:fiuest&#xD;
estates in Canada West. But neither- brother nor sister hsd any de-&#xD;
sire to mingle with the heartless throngs in the fashionable world, who&#xD;
looked upon wealth alone as the true- standard of human greatness -&#xD;
and so, after spendingone winter .in Kingston, they removed to thm&#xD;

years,they had lived retired and almost alone-happy in the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of wealth that enabled them to relieve the wants of the indigent&#xD;
poor and ha-py in the :mutual enjoyment of each other's love. But in&#xD;
an unlucky  our, Edith became acquainted with Col: I9oocdy,, during&#xD;
one of her visits to a'friend in? the city, and as he was allowed by all to&#xD;
be the hands West man in the. British army,.a most perfet gentleman&#xD;
in his' manners, it is littlewonder that the gentle, pure-hearted girl&#xD;
-should feel flattered by the very marked attention she received from&#xD;
-so universal;a.favorite. It is little wonder that when the triple hypo-&#xD;
crite, who had already two living wives, poured into her ears the.story&#xD;
of "his love{ In -words, df burning eloquence, and: besought her, for her&#xD;
sake and his:own, to keep., it a secretfrom, her brother,-alleging as a&#xD;
reason;that they had- quarreled ;ocee, and should a knowledge of their&#xD;
intimacy come to his ears, it might lead to another quarrel, the result&#xD;
of which would doubtless prove fatal .to one o bo -.-little wonder is&#xD;
it, I say, that the guileless maiden should have learped to love the&#xD;
serpenttongued libertine, and that fear for her dai-ling brother's safety,&#xD;
or that- of the man she loved,:should have kept: her silent, and her&#xD;
brother in ignorance of liis pet sister's passion.&#xD;
That she did love the vile, black-hearted villain, and'that her brother,&#xD;
who almost worshiped his gentle sister, remained ignorant of her love-&#xD;
witness the parting scene of the .half-distracted girl from her cottage&#xD;
home.&#xD;
Stephen Marvell, the sailor whom we left there on the lawn, sadly&#xD;
puzzled to contrive what could have become of Miss Edith, or where&#xD;
the stranger could have gone so suddenly, was perhaps thirty years of&#xD;
age, and resided with his mother in a neat little cottage, nearly half a&#xD;
mile from that of the Letts. Steve's mother had been the nurse of&#xD;
Edith in her infancy, and Steve himself had been .young Benjamin's&#xD;
instructor in nautical'matters, and first learned him to manage a sail-&#xD;
boat in the harbor of Kingston, and afterwards a large craft on Lake&#xD;
Ontario. About a year previous to the time of Edith's elopement,&#xD;
Steve had received his 'discharge from the navy, in which he had&#xD;
served for several years, and almost immediately took charge of a beau-&#xD;
tiful little schooner-rigged yacht, belonging to Capt. Ben, as Steve&#xD;
called his young patron.&#xD;
He had been in the habit of visiting the cottage as often as twice&#xD;
every day during Benjamin's absence to Montreal, to see if Edith&#xD;
wanted any little errand executed, and hewas a good deal astonished&#xD;
at not finding her at home, knowing that she was not in the habit of&#xD;
going out in the evening; and when she did so, it was always with her&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
- wFormore than fifteen minutes Steve had remained there, leaning&#xD;
against one of the gate-posts and wondering what. it could all mean,&#xD;
when a horse came galloping up the road from the direction opposite&#xD;
to that taken by the Colonel 'and his companion in their flight, and in&#xD;
another moment Benjamin Letts flung himself'from his jaded animal.&#xD;
grasped the sailor's hand, and inquired for his sister.&#xD;
- " Why, the fact is, Capt. Ben, there is some---"  But Steve didn't&#xD;
finish the sentence, for there was something in the very tone of his&#xD;
voice that alarmed the returned brother ; and springing past.the sailor&#xD;
&#xD;
THE, LAItE BRAO,19&#xD;
ie lfew along the avenue towards the cottage, now dark'and silent, and&#xD;
entering the little, parlor, he called aloud, first the name of his loved&#xD;
sister, and- then impatiently for.one of the ,.two servants, - whom be&#xD;
kne , ought to be about thecottage, for a light.&#xD;
No voice responded to the call--everything in and about the cot.&#xD;
tage was hushed as death.&#xD;
Edith!t Edith ! my sister!" he shouted; but the only answer came&#xD;
from the faint echoes borne back to his listening ears from the slum+&#xD;
bering waters of the tranquil bay.&#xD;
-  Stephen,-have you been here long ?" demanded, the young man, in&#xD;
a tone that had in it so much of anguish that a tear dimmed the eyes&#xD;
of the rough. but kind-hearted sailor, as he replied-&#xD;
"Fraps half an hour; sir."&#xD;
-" And have you seen Edith-?"&#xD;
"No, sir---not to-night. I was over here this mornin', and.-she told&#xD;
me that.she expected you home, early this evenin'"; and. sd when I&#xD;
comes over a little after dark to see you,.I meets a stranger cruising!&#xD;
about here, who told me that he had come up from Lieut. Mlorriswho's&#xD;
harprison at Kingston, to see, you, but he believed there was no one at&#xD;
ome. I thought he was a suspicious-looking craft--that perhaps.he&#xD;
was arobher--and so I made sail for the -cottage to see if everything&#xD;
was shipshape here, and not finding Miss, Edith-about thelace  I run&#xD;
sbc  owee       a     efthe, stranger, but be was bull down; out of&#xD;
sight somewhere, and I did not see him since.'&#xD;
"'And the servants-James and Fanny--have you seen anything of&#xD;
them " -inquired the brother, now painfully excited by what the sailor&#xD;
had told him., -y                     Y ectd, ywa tesio&#xD;
Yes, sit; they was at our, cottage an .hour before sundown, and&#xD;
 Fanny told mother that Miss Edith had given them permission to spend&#xD;
- thevening-atra party-that Mary Weston--has to night."&#xD;
"-Steven," said the ha-distracted young- man, stifling his emotion,&#xD;
however, by a powerful effort,"mount my horse and go to Mr. Weston's&#xD;
at once, andinquire of James and Fanny if they know aught of their&#xD;
mistress' absence from home, and request them to return to the cottage&#xD;
'~at once "&#xD;
f Aye, aye, sir," responded Steve, and in a moment he was urging the&#xD;
r  noble horse forward towards, the rustic, scene of festivity, while. the&#xD;
,bereaved brother, having procured a light, was making the most diligent&#xD;
search throughout the cottage, for some clue, that might lead to the&#xD;
r. mystery of the sister's strange disappearance.&#xD;
Within anjhour Steve returned, accompanied by the two servants;&#xD;
but all the information they could give was, that when they left the&#xD;
cottage, Edith was engaged with her birds and flowers in the par.&#xD;
br, and was apparently as happy and light-hearted as the birds them.&#xD;
A selves.&#xD;
After more than an hour's unavailing search for the lost maiden,&#xD;
the grief-stricken brother dismissed the servants; and after requesting&#xD;
c Steve to be at the cottage early on the following morning, prepared to&#xD;
accompany him to Kingston, he flung himself into a chair in the little&#xD;
parlor.-.-the very one last occupied by his sister-and buried his.face&#xD;
in his hands. .For along time he remained there by the open casement.&#xD;

would be wdll to have an interview with the young-officer as early as&#xD;
possible, as he would be able, doubtless, to afford some ino to the&#xD;

proper authorities, which was not until near noon on the following&#xD;

Shepherd's testimony which he gave in on his examination, that he had&#xD;
been employed to carry off the daughter of Bill Johnson, not by Sir&#xD;
Francis Bransley, but by Col. Henry Moody, of the Royal Rifles.&#xD;
Young Letts started, and his lips grew pale at the mention of that&#xD;
name. Strange that he should not have thought of it before. He&#xD;
saw it-all now, plainlyenough ; it was the libertine Colonel who =had&#xD;
done him that foal wrong. In a moment the whole truth flashed upon&#xD;
his brain. He remembered how, more' than a year before, he had&#xD;
chastised the brutal villain publicly, for wantonly and grossly insulting&#xD;
a helpless woman. He remembered the base coward's oft reiterated&#xD;
threats of vengeand ; and but too well came back the recollection of&#xD;
certain vague rumors that lie had once heard of an intimacy between&#xD;
ithe vile wretch and his loved and lost sister.&#xD;

su4enly sprung up in his heart, he rushed forth from the prison,&#xD;

Like a madman, he sped along the street, to the quarters of the&#xD;
Colonel, hurling men, women and. children from his whirlwind path a&#xD;

S Half the width of the city had been traversed in this furious man&#xD;

BAILS UNDER THE FREE FLAG.&#xD;
9I do-believe you think what now you speak ; but what we do determine, oft we&#xD;
break."-HAMLET.&#xD;
IT was some minutes past. nine"o'clock, on the evening ot young&#xD;
Letts' arrest and imprisonment, as related at the close of the last chap-&#xD;
ter, that the soldier who mounted guard in the hall of Col. Moody's&#xD;
quarters, knocked at'the door of that officer's private parlor, and open.&#xD;
n the door without waiting for a response from within, he found his&#xD;
commander dressed with more than ordinary elegance, and engaged&#xD;
before a looking-glass, in giving his glossy whiskers and superb mous-&#xD;
tache their last exquisite curl. Advancing just two paces within the&#xD;
door, the soldier stood erect, and touching his cap with true military&#xD;
decision, he informed the Colonel that a man at the door below wished&#xD;
o speak with him immediately, on urgent business.&#xD;
"Whoever he is," said the' officer, "bid him come to-morrow, or at&#xD;
any other time ; say to him that I am engaged for this evening, and&#xD;
can -see no one."                                                 Y,&#xD;
H e    oobademe say, sir," replied the soldier, respectfully, " that his&#xD;
business concerned you as wellas hiniself; and that his engagements&#xD;
elsewhere will not permit him to visit you.nAomorrow."&#xD;
"His-name ?" inquired the Colonel, impatiently; " did he not tell ;&#xD;
you his name 2&#xD;
"He did, sir " but said I was not to mention it, unless you refused&#xD;
to see bm."&#xD;
which h I do, most positively-; and now, what is it 7'"&#xD;
t nu (Oliver Shephard, ,sir."&#xD;
Show him up, instantly," thundered the Colonel, as a frown black&#xD;
as midnight gathered upon his brow ; and as the soldier hastily re-&#xD;
treated from the room, something very like a smothered curse was&#xD;
borne to his ear, from the lips of the handsome officer.&#xD;
In a few moments Oliver Shephard was ushered into the presence s&#xD;
of Col. Moody ; but if he had not been previously announced, or had&#xD;
ot that officer been a great deal better acquainted with him than we&#xD;
are, he certainly never would have recognized him, so completely was&#xD;
he changed, so far as appearances are concerned, from the ruffian, as we&#xD;
saw him there on Linda's Island, or the disguised sailor of the night&#xD;
previous, which Steve Marvell had so unexpectedly encountered in the&#xD;
cottage grounds.  He was dressed in a close-fitting and very fashion-.&#xD;
able black coat, black pants, black gloves, hat and vest, all seemingly&#xD;
in perfect harmony with his blacker character, except his cravat and,&#xD;
the bosom of his shirt, which were faultlessly white ; and then his&#xD;
smooth, unwrinkled face, divested of every particle of beard or whisk-&#xD;

the vile miscreant that he really was.&#xD;
" Shephard," said the Colonel, after he had eyed the intruder' f6"&#xD;
several seconds, " why have you come hither, when you know I expect-&#xD;
ed to meet you at another place'-nore than a mile distant, within this&#xD;
fifteen minutes 2" and the Colonel's eyes glanced impatiently towards&#xD;
the alabaster time-piece on the side-board.&#xD;
" "Why, the fact is, Colonel,"-replied Shephard, I thought you might&#xD;
change yourmind about that first affair, and pay me as you agreed to;&#xD;
and then you know if you wish my services afterwards, why I 'can get&#xD;
there quite as soon as you can."&#xD;
.Olhver Shephard," exclaimed the officer, rather sharply, "why did&#xD;
you express yourself satisfied, this morning, when I paid-you a hundred&#xD;
and fifty pounds for a:service that you did not perform ?"&#xD;
"Simply, Col. Moody, because I could -do no better. 'Tis true' I&#xD;
did not carry the lady off, but that was not my. fault ; I should have&#xD;
done it if you had not prevented me by doing the job yourself. And&#xD;
then it strikes me that I ought to have something for that other&#xD;
affair.&#xD;
O " Didyou not propose the terms yourself ?" asked the Colonel, an.&#xD;
grily; were they not that you were to receive two hundred pounds if&#xD;
you succeeded I getting the girl safe to Kingston; and nothing, in&#xD;
case of failure ?"r&#xD;
"All than is very true, Colonel."&#xD;
"Then, sir, why do you demand of me money that you have never&#xD;
earned-?2"&#xD;
"Because I thought you would pay it."&#xD;
"Then you are vastly mistaken; I will never pay you a farthing&#xD;
more than I have agreed"to."&#xD;
Nor even that, if you could avoid it ; but it strikes me, Col. Moody,&#xD;
that you will pay the whole, and more- too."&#xD;
"What mean you?2"&#xD;

~isa I: haT ri'is companion laughed, eslltingl, in his turn; s&#xD;
he held a folded paper before the Colonel's eyes,-and then, amomen&#xD;
after rwards; read nmaclear, deliberate tone-&#xD;
'Certificate of marriage between- Colonel Henry Moody and Miss&#xD;
Mary Anhault, of Hamilton, Canada West!"&#xD;
c In the name oflueifer t'' almost yelled the Colonel, how came that&#xD;
paper in your possession ?" and he snatched at the certificate, which:&#xD;
the other held beyond his reach, as he replied :'&#xD;
"AIt matters not, Col.b Moody; you see I have-it. We lawyers' got&#xD;
hold of some strange :secrets sometimes ; and now, Colonel, you caa&#xD;
order up your soldiers as soon as you choose. But stay, I have another&#xD;
document here whieh i may as well read to you, as it is uncertain when&#xD;
we-may meet again.'' ,So saying,-the lawyer.spy drew forth from his,&#xD;
bosom a second paper, folded similar to the first, and comimenced&#xD;
reading-&#xD;
'-Landon Hall, Staffordshire, 1832. Married--Lady Juliett-&#xD;
.".Stop ! demon-fiend----or whatever you- are ; stop and answer&#xD;
me--&#xD;
But the lawyer went on, as the bewildered Colonel sank gasping&#xD;
into a chair--&#xD;
"cHarrowly, to Cl Henry.-&#xD;
" ,---s-a1" again gasped the guilty wreteh, as he sat there, writhing;&#xD;
in convulsive agony ; but he failed to articulate a single word, and there&#xD;
came forth from his lips an impotent hiss, shrill as that from theex-&#xD;
panded jaws of a-hoof-trodden adder.'&#xD;
" Come, Col. Moody," said the lawyer, " order up your soldiers at&#xD;
once ; I am ready, and I fear if you. delay here much longer, your&#xD;
bride will grow. impatient"&#xD;
"1Nay, Shephard," said the Colonel, somewhat recovered from his,&#xD;
agitation; _"why should we both make fools of ourselves-? Cannot this&#xD;

" Yes, I think it may."&#xD;

.   the libertine Colonel arid' his equally unprincipled -awseoiate 'left the&#xD;
apartment for the' purpose of eonsunmating one of the most iiterij&#xD;
acts in the whole catalogue of erime.&#xD;
Steve Marvell, whom the reader will recollect we left there in the&#xD;
person with the'yonn r lieutenant, as soon as he partially reover-ed' fron&#xD;
the surprise into which Lettsa'dden departure had thrown hini. almo ii&#xD;
immediately left the'cell. promising to see his friend again as soon is&#xD;
possible. and set out after Letts.&#xD;
He did not find him. however; and after runniase u-ae street, and&#xD;
down another, for more than half an hour, he suddenig came to'.a dead&#xD;
halt at the corner of two streets, where he remained for neareffe ve&#xD;
minutes in a perfect puzzle as to what course he should steer next:&#xD;
At length, as if inspired with some new idea, he darted away again&#xD;
down the streets like a locomotive ; but ere he had gone ten rods, he&#xD;
espied. close to him, a perfect giant of a sailor coming down. Steve&#xD;
took the outide of the side-walk in order to let his slipmate gd'elear&#xD;
of him; and the other sheered the same way for 'the sanH s  reason'&#xD;
"'Hard a starboard "shouted Steve, when he saw that there was&#xD;
danger of a collision.&#xD;
"Port ! hard a port !" roared the giant, for the same reason; arid&#xD;
both the sailors 'sheered the wrong way again.&#xD;
z         Main-topsail haul. you bugger !* screamed Steve.&#xD;
"Hard up your helm, you' bloody mndrine !" yelled the big one ;and&#xD;
the next inoment the two tars wont headlong afoul of each 6ther- viith&#xD;
a rash, a concussion, and rebound, that 'capsized some half a doana&#xD;
of the peaceable land'crafts in the neighborhood.&#xD;
" Helicla ' I say, shipmnate " said Steve, witle the blood spouted.'&#xD;
out of'his mouth and nose, and lie' Iathered about there among the&#xD;
crowd like a ninety-barrel "synern" in his deat h-'furry"--" blast ine&#xD;
if I don't b'ieve you runy into me a purpose" and he began epuariiig'&#xD;
S      off for a bout in real earnest, when the stranger seized him by thle arm'&#xD;
and benling donrr his'lips close to hip ear, he whispered something that&#xD;
caused Steve Marvell to utter two guieh exclainations--one of nget&#xD;
and apparent surprise, and the other sounded very much like adngira"'&#xD;
'}    tion and joy.&#xD;
After a few moments of low, earnest conversation together, Stev&#xD;
E dbkthe arm' o his gigantic cenirade, and' the two started of together&#xD;

&#xD;
Letts, which he had himself witnessed nearly-half an hour previously;&#xD;
then he told him that'he had discovered where Col. Moody had placed&#xD;
Edith, and offered to assist Steve in removingher beyond the reach&#xD;
of the villain's power. But it was the stranger's name that caused&#xD;
Steve Marvell to utter. the..second exclamation. That name, spoken&#xD;
aloud in the streets  f.Kingston, would have aroused the whole British&#xD;
garrison.to arms in fifteen minutes. Do you not guess who this rough&#xD;
giant sailor was ? - No ?:. Well, then, permit me to whisper it to you.&#xD;
very gently--it would scarcely be prudent to speak it incautiously in&#xD;
the crowded streets of Kingston, and in, broad daylight too. Listen,&#xD;
then. It was Bill Johnson, the Pirate of the Lakes!&#xD;
As Steve and his companion passed on through the city, they every-&#xD;
where beheld large. placards, posted up, the purport of which was, that&#xD;
any persons suspected of plotting.against the government, or known to&#xD;
express themselves in favor of a rebellion, were liable to be arrested,&#xD;
upon the complaint of any respectable citizen, and if found guilty, they&#xD;
would be punished with the, utmost rigor of the law, which was death&#xD;
or transportation for life ;. and their property would be confiscated, one-,&#xD;
half of it going to government, and the other. to the person making the&#xD;
complaint.&#xD;
"Confiscation " said Steve, after he had read one of the hand-bills,&#xD;
"dam me, if I wouldn't like to con-fiscate the whole infernal crew of,&#xD;
'em into the St. Lawrence."&#xD;
As they gained the outskirts of the city, they halted, and Johnson.&#xD;
pointed out to Steve alone house which stood at a little distance in&#xD;
the country, and informed him that Edith was there.-&#xD;
He also told him that he had been in town two days in disguise,&#xD;
waiting an opportunity to see or communicate in some manner with&#xD;
Stanly Morris, of whose imprisonment he had heard almost immedi-&#xD;
ately after it took place. He was determined to release the young&#xD;
officer in some way, but the prison was so strictly guardedithat he had&#xD;
not been able to accomplish anything as yet.&#xD;
" And now," added the lion-hearted old smuggler, "we must rescue'&#xD;
this girl from the clutches of that' infernal villain first, and then we'll&#xD;
find a chance to work for the boys afterwards. But look here, Steve, ,&#xD;
how are we to get away with her?  I came here in a steamer, andif&#xD;
we attempt to pass through the city so as to take the ferry boat for the-&#xD;
American side, I fear we shall 'be- discovered ;, and whatever we do,&#xD;
niust be done before night, as it is probable the Colonel will be out this&#xD;
evening; and just as likely as not he will remove Edith to some place&#xD;
where we can't find her to-morrow.&#xD;
"KI have it," said Steve, the moment his companion ceased to-speak.&#xD;
'  urrah ! I'll work a Tom, Og' traverse on 'em beautiful. Look ere&#xD;
Capt. Ben's got a little beauty of a.craft up there by the cottage-a ra'al&#xD;
rattler to sail.. She's Pa ned after Miss Edith, and she's almost as&#xD;
handsome too. Now, down here in the stables at the King's head,&#xD;
there's two as fast ,horges as can lefoupd jn the Midland District.&#xD;
-Capt.. Ben and I rodet them _don jAst night. Don't you see, we can&#xD;
get the horsea out up here, get the girl started, and in anihour from&#xD;
- now we'll have her safe aboard of her little namesake ; and if we don't,&#xD;
&#xD;
work to wind'ard of Beelzebub, jr., on this tack, my name aint Steve&#xD;
Marvell."&#xD;
"Capital!" exclaimed Johnson, when he had heard Steve's plan;&#xD;
'excellent ! And now, while you go for the horses, I'll see Edith, and&#xD;
manage to have her all ready against yourreturn."&#xD;
At the expiration of half an hour, Steve had the two horses at the&#xD;
gate that opened into the field in front .of the lone house, and in less.-&#xD;
than thre minutes the stalwart old smuggler made his appearance,&#xD;
almost bearing in his sturdy arms the drooping form of the nearly&#xD;
heart-broken girl, whom, as gently as he could, he had made acquainted&#xD;
with her brother's imprisonment, and the base villany of- the libertine&#xD;
Colonel.&#xD;
"1You'll have to sail Big Pete, Captain," said Steve, "and I'm think-&#xD;
ing you'll have to take charge of Miss' Edith, too, for I'm 'fraidI'll&#xD;
tuible overboard if.I undertake to hold -n to an extra deck-load.'&#xD;
Very well. Steve, I'll carry Miss Edith ; and now let us be off, for&#xD;
that old she dragon in there swears she will inform the Colonel.if she&#xD;
can find him, and have him after us with his whole regiment of Rofal&#xD;
Rifles."&#xD;
Old Bill vaulted into the saddle, and taking the weeping girl in his&#xD;
arms just as a mother would her infant, loosened the reins, and the&#xD;
next moment the. two noble-steeds were covering the ground at:&#xD;
killing pace towards the so recently deserted home ofthe maiden.&#xD;
It was but a little past noon when they arrived at the cottage, and&#xD;
after seeing Edith aboard the yacht, which lay at a little wharf not ten&#xD;
rodsfrom the gate of the lawn, they set to work removing the furni&#xD;
ture of the cottage, arguing that, as it was all liable to be confiscated,&#xD;
it was better to be on the safe side and carry itj11 off  With such. a&#xD;
right good will did they ply their bqsy task, that before sunset- every&#xD;
moveable thing was safely stowed away on board the schooner. which&#xD;
was immediately got under weigh-and, under easy sail, with the Ameri-&#xD;
can flag flying at. her main peak, she was kept standing off and on&#xD;
close in with the land, waiting to see what would happen during th.&#xD;
night.&#xD;
In the meantime, CoL Moody, ignorant of the escape of his viearn,&#xD;
had, as we have already seen, secured the services of the villain:Shep&#xD;
hard to aid him i his nefarious scheme, which was nothing less than&#xD;
getting the infatuated girl more completely than ever into his power,&#xD;
by imposing upon her a false marriage. It would appear that the&#xD;
woman in whose care Edith had been left, had failed' to execute her&#xD;
threat made to the smuggler, or else she had been unable to -find him;&#xD;
for, as we already knows he did not leave his quarters till after nin&#xD;
o'clock, and then Edith had been on board the yacht some nine&#xD;
hours.&#xD;

NVR was there a summer's evening more serenely, more gloriosly&#xD;
beautiful, than that on which Col. Moody, accompanied by his v.ile&#xD;
accomplice, left his quarters, with the fell purpose in his heart of cosu-&#xD;
fitting an act more heinous, in the sight of the Omnipotent God and&#xD;
all good men, than even murder itself. It tas murder-murder of the&#xD;
deepest, blackest dye-the murder of female innocence.&#xD;
Not a cloud specked the clear blue heavens, or dimmed the splendor&#xD;
of the bright-suminer moon, now at its full, and all nature seemed gladly&#xD;
whispering back its thanks to the "Giver'of all good," as the soft mur-&#xD;
muring breezes gentle stirred 'the waving grain, or toyed with the dark&#xD;
luxuriant foliage of fruit and ornamental trees that skirted the way-&#xD;
side beyond the limits of the city, traversed by these two demons'in&#xD;
human form, bound on an errand more befitting the wild howlings' of&#xD;
the midnight' hurricane and the character of the arch fiend himself,&#xD;
than such a lovely sunier evening and men claiming the rank, holding&#xD;
the position, and clothed in the garb of gentlemen.  -&#xD;
Regardless of the enchanting-beauty of the night, and in silent con-&#xD;
munion with their own dark thoughts, the two villains rode on without&#xD;
interchanging-a single word, till the gate in front of the lone house was&#xD;
gained, where they were met by the woman in whose care Edith had&#xD;
been left, who, before they had time to dismount, informed the Colonel&#xD;
of the escape of hia-victini, and all' the 'circumstances connected with&#xD;
it, so far as she knew them. She "had, she said, immediately sought&#xD;
him in the city, but being unable to discover his address, she was&#xD;
obliged to return, and wait as patiently as she could for his arrival.'&#xD;
" What were these two men like 7" impatiently demanded thb Colonel,&#xD;
as the woman concluded her account of the flairi.&#xD;
"One of them was a handsome-looking sailor, dbout thirty, I should&#xD;
think, with reddish whiskers and hair, light blud eyes, and very fair,&#xD;
red cheeks."  .&#xD;
"Steve Marvell, that dare-devil. sailor who has been so much in&#xD;
company with that traitor Beu Letts, of late !" exclaimed the Colonel.&#xD;
"And the other----what sort of a man was he 7"&#xD;
"Why, sir, he was a monstrous big fellow, dressed in regular sailor&#xD;
style, canvas trousers, Gurnsey frock, tarpaulin hat and all; and then&#xD;
his face was almost covered with black, shaggy whiskers ; but I could&#xD;
see a great ugly scar here on his left cheek, and -oh I such eyes as he&#xD;
had--they were just like two live coals of fire, and ho seemed to look&#xD;
&#xD;
TE LAKE. BIMVO.&#xD;
right through one. 1, tell you, he was the first man that ever made&#xD;
me tremble and wilt right down, by looking at me.'&#xD;
"Bill Johnson.!" said Shephard, with: startling emphasis; I caught&#xD;
a glimpse of that figure running after a couple of raftenien in King&#xD;
street about noon to-day, and I was almost certain at the time that it&#xD;
was him- I stopped foria few moments, and kept any eye on him till"I&#xD;
saw him run against thia same Steve Marvell, and then they beg n&#xD;
whispering together, when it occurred to me that Old Bliull hatvisited:&#xD;
I'ngston for the purpose of endeavoring:to get that boy-lientesanh nZ&#xD;
of person. I was very much engaged at the time ; but as it was prok'&#xD;

of the beautiful yacht, almost insensible  om the very intensity of het&#xD;
anguish. .Reorse, shame, despair, and bitter soulsikening conviction&#xD;
of her error, had all combined to rush her down. to the lowest d-epth&#xD;
Of human woe; and she lay there writhing in mental agony, driven4-to&#xD;
the-verge of ienanit.&#xD;
Thesmuggler and Steve were seated together near the helm, en d&#xD;

hauled chock aft, wei creeping along, barely moving through the wate&#xD;
sufficiently to give her steerage-way, and not a hundred  homs from&#xD;

Suddenly the attention of Steve and his companion- was arrested by&#xD;
the quick, confused tramp of many horses, and a moment afterwards&#xD;
the whole troop of dragoons came into full view in a turning of the road&#xD;
nearly a quarter of a mile distant. On they came, sweeping along dow&#xD;

The smuggler was quietly smoking a cigar, and as the dragoons drew&#xD;
rein on the beach, almost in the very edge of the water abreast of the&#xD;

"Insolent dog!" roared the now foaming Colonel, " if you do'.not&#xD;

$teve was Anute with horror and-astonishment at the very thought&#xD;
of 'this fiendish threat ; but the old smuggler left his position by the&#xD;
main nmast, and going to the-side of the, little vessel, as if he would-get&#xD;
as near as possible- to his enemies, he bared his head, and raising his&#xD;
right arm towards heaven, he replied to the infernal threat of'the brutal&#xD;
officer, in a voice so terrible that it sent a thrill of terror through the&#xD;
hearts of all who heard it, and. the sturdy dragoons, who feared not&#xD;
death itself, quivered there in their saddles as they listened.&#xD;
" Col. Moody," he-said, "such threats as you have just made becomes&#xD;
you 'well, foul blot that you are upon the fair escutcheon of manhood;&#xD;
ut.they are scarcely in .keeping withthe character of a British officer.&#xD;
And so you think to intimidate that brave, noble'hearted, man there,&#xD;
by such hellish threats as these?  Tis will, most, valiant Colonel;' and&#xD;
since yor choose to bully, I too Wilt threaten. 'And I think there are&#xD;
some few persons in Canada that will vouch for t'he truth of what Ip say,&#xD;
when I tell you that for more than twenty years Bill Johnson has&#xD;
never forfeited his word to friends or enemies. And now listen to&#xD;
me, Col. Moody. Dare but to execute that fiendish threat, or even&#xD;
repeat it in my hearing, and-by the ever living God! you shall die a&#xD;
death of more exquisite torture than was ever thought of, even by&#xD;
those monsters of cruelty the Spanish - Inquisitors.  Like a sleuth&#xD;
bound I'll follow ye. to the death ; and though ye were hedged in&#xD;
by every sword and bayonet in the whole British army, I'll drag ye&#xD;
from their protection, and with this good right hand PIl pleck your&#xD;
black heart, still Warm and palpitating, from your felon carcass ! As&#xD;
God'Almighty hears me, I will do it !".&#xD;
There was -something so awful, so almost -superhuman, in the tone&#xD;
and manner of the giant old smuggler, as he stood there in the bright&#xD;
moonlight, with bared head, and upraised arm, hurling back his defi-&#xD;
ance and, dreadful threat in the teeth of the epauletted brute, that&#xD;
'a cold. death-like shudder shot like an icebolt through every frame,&#xD;
and; many of the dragoons bowed their heads to their very saddle-&#xD;
bows, as if some terrible phantom was hovering in the air above them,&#xD;
;and 'they thus sought to shut out the horrid vision.&#xD;
For five long minutes they sat there on their horses, as motionless&#xD;
as statues ; .and- all' the time the yacht was forging slowly ahead, keep-&#xD;
ing along down just about the same distance from the shore.&#xD;

cannot tell you what we shmal bear, but let us lie .  Zf aun eas&#xD;
a right to be alone and talk to himself, we certainly have an equal&#xD;
right to creep up close to him, and get at his secrets if we can.&#xD;
So here we are, in a most gratifying position, both for seeing and&#xD;
hearing; and now let~us first geatify our eyes by taking a good look at&#xD;
bim, and then we shall be prepared to listen more attentively.&#xD;
At the first glance, you woid;say that the stranger before us was&#xD;
one far past the age usually alotted to'man, from the circumstance of&#xD;
his being very much bent, as with the accumulated weight of many&#xD;
years; and then you observe that his lihir,'1ong and f *own  as nwo-&#xD;
an's,- and  the venerable beard that fi low d'o*in on 'his beast, are&#xD;
both white-aye, as white as the foam-crest of the storm-tossed billow.&#xD;
A second glance, and ou. see your error, for his brow and face, where&#xD;
it is not covered, withbear d are both smooth, ,very fair, and unmarked&#xD;
b a single line by whieh we tell'the rapid foiotstep of old Time after&#xD;
have passed the half-way house of life.- And ten his eyes of deep,&#xD;
liquid blue, still retain much of that indescribable something-4 call it&#xD;
the soulifire-which barns out, and leaves the orb of vision Jstreless&#xD;
and dim, long before the busy old reaper has fixed the seal of;.extreme&#xD;
"old age upon the  irow. You are very positive now, that the stranger&#xD;
is not an oldi man ; forty or forty-five. not older than that, certain;&#xD;
and yet you can scarcely reconcile in your mind the vivid contr idictioni&#xD;
betweenn his fair, unwrinkled features, and 'the long flowing locks and&#xD;
-heard of snowy whiteness.&#xD;
Did you never dream that sorrow and care, long wearyears of deep&#xD;
remote, may blanch the hair, and 'still leave no traces of their handi-&#xD;
work upon the features-&#xD;
Go uldwe but read the hidden mysteries of the human heart as we&#xD;
do the pages of an open book, how .many such instances should we find&#xD;
in thi busy, every-day world of ours.-&#xD;
One look at the stranger's garb, and it needs but a single, hasty&#xD;
glance to take in the whole ; for 'tis but a simple vesture, so far as you&#xD;
can see, composed of a single garment. A. long, flowing robe, r gown&#xD;
of some coarse material, like those worn by the palmers of theolden&#xD;
time, when they went forth, staff in band, on their long, weary pilgrim.&#xD;
ages to the Holy Land.&#xD;
His head and feet are bare, and thus, you see, his whole exterior&#xD;
&#xD;
-THE LAKI BRAVO.&#xD;
costume is made up of that one garment, of coarse gray fabric, gathered&#xD;
close about his throat, and falling quite down to his ancles..&#xD;
But let me whisper to you a secret, and then we will listen together&#xD;
to catch another, if possible, from th4 lips of the stranger ; mine first,&#xD;
however ; listen :&#xD;
That strange, mysterious being, there before us, is called the Hermit&#xD;
of the Genesee; sometimes, the River Hermit. For fourteen years,&#xD;
be has made his solitary home here in this lone, gloomy retreat ; not&#xD;
in either of those tottering old shells, called houses, there ; no, no. even&#xD;
he would shun such desolation.  You look incredulous, but I assure&#xD;
you it is very true. His. home is here, but a few reds from where we&#xD;
are seated.&#xD;
Do you see yonder projection of rocks almost at the top of the bank&#xD;
above that old ruined rail-way, which was once used to let goods down&#xD;
to the warehouse ? that thicket up there, where the leaves look greener&#xD;
and darker than they do all around them ? - The roots of those bushes&#xD;
grow in the damp soil, watered by a little fountain that gushes out of&#xD;
tie cold, bare rock above them.&#xD;
You might pass up and down the river, narrow as it is here, scarce&#xD;
three hundred feet in width, a thousand times ; or sit here on the old&#xD;
wharf for months; or travel along the road that runs within twenty&#xD;
feet of the brow of the cliff, for years, and never dream that that&#xD;
wild, dark nook up there, was inhabited by man, 'Tis true, neverthe-&#xD;
less.  There is a dark, rude grotto in that green nook, and that&#xD;
grotto is the Hermit's home. There are those living near here, who&#xD;
well recollect the day lie first came to the landing. le remained some&#xD;
three months at the little cave, and then he was gone for two whole&#xD;
years, no one knew whither. At length he returned-that was four-&#xD;
teen years ago---and ever since then, he has lived there solitary and&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
Those who knew him when he came first, say that he was very hand-&#xD;
some, richly dressed, with beautiful brown hair and beard; and he was&#xD;
as erect as yonder graceful young walnut, that you see over there on&#xD;
the opposite bank.&#xD;
There are a few here with whom he converses freely, upon all subjects&#xD;
that do not concern himself. Of his own history, or his former con-&#xD;
dition in life, he can never be induced to speak ; and in all the long time&#xD;
thit he has dwelt here, there is not a single person who has l.een able&#xD;
to learn even his name.&#xD;
There, now that I have told you all that is known here of the hermit,&#xD;
t   we will listen, if you please, for you observe he is speaking. Listen :&#xD;
"'Tis well. The tune will come, and sooner than I had dared to&#xD;
hope. This intelligence, slight, and imperfect as it is, has given me&#xD;
4 ck full ten years of a life that I had hoped was well near ended.&#xD;
With such men as Papineau in the Lower Province, and McKenzie in&#xD;
the West, to cry them on, the people of the. Canadas will yet rise in&#xD;
their might, and shake the strong pillars of the British government to&#xD;
Sthe very throne.&#xD;
k-Iknow nothing of the immediate causes which have prompted&#xD;
these late exhibitions of popular feeling; nor do I care. All I now&#xD;
ask is, an opportunity to wreak my utmost vengeance upon that thrice&#xD;

&#xD;
THE EMPRfSS OF THE ISLES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
damned villain, whose infernal machinations first dashed the cup of&#xD;
bliss almost untasted from my lips, and then drove me, like anunquiet&#xD;
spirit, forth from my Eden home, rendering my whole existence liv-&#xD;
ing -hell.&#xD;
"I have no hope, no wish, nothing now on earth to live for, but&#xD;
revenge.&#xD;
re0O, the very thought is madness ! ~ I, who was and an the rightful&#xD;
heir to one-of the proudest baronies in Britain, the possessor of titles,&#xD;
wealth unbounded, happiness little less than that of heaven ; all--all-.&#xD;
0, God ! spare me my reason till my revenge shall have been accom-&#xD;
plished-    Richard Delamerc-Oliver Shephard-or whatever name&#xD;
you may please to assume-there is a long arrear of hate to be settled&#xD;
between us when we meet. But this is idle; henceforth I will be calm&#xD;
till the time comes, and then my motto shall be, " actions, not words."&#xD;
Thus abruptly the hermit' terminated his soliloquy, and now he sits&#xD;
there in silence, and gazes sadly about him, as if his tnirnd was not&#xD;
altogether right.&#xD;
It is not much, you will say, that we have gained by listening.&#xD;
True, it is not much ; but eves-droppers, you know, must not always&#xD;
expect to bear everything just as they could wish. We have learned,&#xD;
at least, that yonder Hermit has once been happy ; that he has been&#xD;
deeply, foully wronged, and has still a heart and will to avenge that&#xD;
wrong.&#xD;
We have learned, too, that the base ireteh--Oliver Shephard-.-is in&#xD;
some way connected with the Hermit's previous history ; and that he&#xD;
has at some time borne' another name than that by which he is now&#xD;
known. Do you remember with what emphasis the Hermit spoke that&#xD;
name ; and how his eyes glared, as if the mere sound excited some&#xD;
latent passion-long smothered in his bosom ?&#xD;
Richard Delamere ! We will recollect that name.&#xD;
Well, thus much we have gained, and with this we should be satisfied.&#xD;
We must, perforce ; for the Hermit is silent, and shows no disposition&#xD;
to enlighten us further.&#xD;
But look there ! Is it not a beautiful sight?  Down there, not&#xD;
twenty rods below the old wharf, where the river winds abruptly around&#xD;
that bold, wooded point, that shuts out all the view beyond. See-first&#xD;
a graceful spar, taper and glossy with bright varnish, comes pointing&#xD;
out by the dark green foliage. Then a white sail gleams in the warm&#xD;
sunlight, followed by another, and another ; and stealing gently into&#xD;
view from the cover of the green head-land, you see a magnificent craft,&#xD;
in all .the perfect symmetry of sails and cordage, and graceful spars,&#xD;
gliding silently along like the shadow of a fleeting cloud, upon the&#xD;
gorgeous summer landscape.&#xD;
There are two persons only upon the deck of the beautiful little&#xD;
vessel, both of whom we recognize at the first glance-Steve Marvell&#xD;
and --. But the Hermit anticipates us. He too has recognized the&#xD;
stalwart old smuggler, disguised as he is ; and, as the yacht ranges up&#xD;
alongside the old wharf, he speaks his name aloud, but in an absent&#xD;
tone, as if all unconscious of what he speaks---" William Johnson.-&#xD;
" You know me, it seems," said the smuggler, in reply, as he leaped&#xD;
upon the wharf with a line to make the yacht fast.; "you have cer-&#xD;

curse or heap a malediction upon the libertine Colonel   ehad&#xD;
" Edith Letts," said the Hermit, amusingly, when the te beautiful -&#xD;
concluded the tale of villainy and wrong which  m&#xD;
creature a maniac-" Edith Letts ! It. was her mother's name,I.re-&#xD;
member. Her parents I counted among my earliest and most esteemed&#xD;
friends. She had a brother, if I mistake not----a fair, bright-eyed boy,&#xD;
when I last saw him-some four years old, I think. Does he live?"&#xD;
" He does," replied Johnson; "he lives in one of the gloomiest cells&#xD;
of a Canadian prison, where he has been incarcerated at the instiga-&#xD;
tion of the accursed knave who has wrought his sister's ruin."&#xD;
"'Tis well," exclaimed the Hermit, in an exulting tone;  i only&#xD;
needs a few more such acts of high-handed outrage and gross injustice,&#xD;
sanctioned by a corrupt government, to light up the torch of Canadian&#xD;
Revolution from Cape Diamond to Pentangoshene. But what present&#xD;
disposition do you propose making of this poor child .,,&#xD;
" I had intended w;hen we left the cottage, night before last, an-&#xD;
swered the smuggler, " to have taken her to my home, at the French&#xD;
Creek ; but when we got out of the bay, we found the wind was very&#xD;
fresh at northeast, with every appearance of its remaining so for several -&#xD;
days, and so after standing along to the eastward till yesterday about&#xD;
this time, we discovered a British steamer and two cutters from Kings-&#xD;
ton, down to windward of us a few miles, evidently waiting to intercept&#xD;
us if we attempted to enter the St. Lawrence.  r"-         But&#xD;
" And then we became convinced, too, that this poor girl-"&#xD;
Edith bent upon the speaker such a keen, scrutinizing glance, that he&#xD;
paused abruptly for a moment. " I feared," he resumed, leaving a&#xD;
blank to be filled by the imagnation of his listening companion,. that&#xD;
my rough home, with so muci noise and bustle and so many strangers&#xD;
as there are constantly coming and going, would be but a very improper&#xD;
asylum for this poor girl, under existing circumstances ; and remem-&#xD;
bering that I had, a few years. since, a friend living near this place, at&#xD;
whose house Edith could remain for the present, I consulted with my&#xD;
friend there, who commands the yacht, and we decided to bear up for&#xD;
Genesee River.&#xD;
"And now, my friend, that I have thus answered all yourquestions,&#xD;
perhaps you will gratify me by informing me who you are -"&#xD;
"Yes," replied the Hermit, smiling sadly, " I am a man! a some-&#xD;
what uncouth looking one, 'tis true-but still a man-one that can&#xD;
sympathize with the afflicted, and feel for the wrongs of the oppressed.&#xD;
I am the friend of civil and religious liberty-your friend, William&#xD;
Johnson and the friend of this. poor, injured girl, if you will permit&#xD;
me. With-this you must be satisfied. My name I have sworn never&#xD;
to reveal to mortal man, till---but no matter. The time will per-&#xD;
haps come when you will learn who I am, and what I have been.  ior&#xD;
the present, suffice it that for fourteen years I have lived here in this&#xD;
wild, lonely spot, brooding over the foul wrongs that made me what I&#xD;
am, and living on for future vengeance. I'm known here as the Her-&#xD;
mit of the Genesee. But come, it is getting 'late ; will it pleaseyou&#xD;
and your friend there, to visit my poor home ? 'Tis but a rude habi-&#xD;
tation ; but you shall be welcome."                    .&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LADE BRAVO.                        37&#xD;
Steve Marvell, who had remained there during the conversation&#xD;
between the Hermit and Johnson, now leaped upon the wharf and&#xD;
expressed himself ready to follow the stranger to his home, "provided,"&#xD;
said the sailor, " that it is not in one of them old rookeries up there,'"&#xD;
pointing, as he spoke, in the direction of the old buildings, the roofs of&#xD;
which were just visible above the mass of weeds and briars by which&#xD;
they were surrounded.&#xD;
" Oh, no," replied the Hermit, " my dwelling is not -quite so com-&#xD;
fortless as you would perhaps find those, although it is scarcely more&#xD;
inviting in appearance," and without further ceremony the mysterious&#xD;
stranger started off up-a little intricate zig-zag path, that wound along&#xD;
among the rocks and tangled thickets, closely followed by Steve, who&#xD;
sailor as he was, found this peculiar kind of climbing so new and ex-&#xD;
tremely difficult, that he was gradually dropping astern of his tw&#xD;
companions, one of whom had rendered the tortuous ascent compara-&#xD;
tively easy by long practice, while the other was enabled to keep pace&#xD;
with his leader by the sheer dint of his Herculean powers.  P&#xD;
" Ielloa, shipmate !" sang out Steve, half-way up the steep bank,&#xD;
puffing -and blowing, and floundering along like a "gallied fin-back."&#xD;
'-elloa ! I say, shipmate, it rather strikes me that you'd better have&#xD;
this hill rattled down, if you have to go abaft very often. Hang meif&#xD;
I wouldn't rather shin up the main-truck of a line-o'-battle ship by the&#xD;
royal back-stay, feet foremest."&#xD;
'-Shall I come back and lend you a hand ?" asked the Hermit, stop.&#xD;
ping in his way and looking back at the sailor.&#xD;
" Not to-night," responded Steve, a little nettled at the idea of fallin&#xD;
so far behind two men so much older than himself, and still further, to&#xD;
think that the "old white-haired monk," as he called the Hert&#xD;
should deem it necessary to offer him his assistance. "No!" he elled,&#xD;
" heave ahead, and save the tide there, I'll be along in the coseof&#xD;
the dog-watch."&#xD;
It was nearly dark when the Hermit and Johnson gained the little&#xD;
level platteau in front of the cave, where they halted for a few moments&#xD;
until Steve caine up, when the stranger, requesting them to remain&#xD;
where they were until he procured a light, advanced a few paces, and&#xD;
displacing two upright planks that stood against the cliff, disclosea&#xD;
narrow cleft in the solid wall of nature's masonry. He entered the&#xD;
dark aperture, and for a few moments all was still and dark but&#xD;
there was a glimmer of light within the cavern, and the Hermitre-&#xD;
appeared with a torch formed of a blazing pine knot, and beckoned his&#xD;
guests to enter. Passing through the narrow opening, which was so&#xD;
low that they were obliged to stoop in entering, they found themselves&#xD;
in a cave of very limited dimensions, as to width, but so lofty that the&#xD;
vid rays from the burning knot failed to disclose the ceiling, and died&#xD;
away amid the  gimmerian blackness of the unknown height. The&#xD;
granite floor was as level, almost, as though it had been fashioned by&#xD;
the hand and chisel of a stone-cutter ; but the bare-walls were com-&#xD;
posed of rorgh, uncouth blocks, irregular in all their endlessvariert&#xD;
of shapes and angles, piled one upon another, as if nature, in her wild-&#xD;
est mood, had walled in that gloomy cavern with her most unsightly&#xD;
material, thereby forming the most striking contrast in the floor and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7541-00000020"/>&#xD;
88            THE EMIP$LESS OF THE ISLES ; OR,&#xD;
walls, between order and chaos. The floor was nature's "art," the&#xD;
walls nature herself.&#xD;
The air of the cave was pure--no appearance of dampness was visible&#xD;
anywhere; but there was not a single article of furniture, or any of&#xD;
the hundred things which it might be supposed even a hermit could&#xD;
not well dispense with, to be seen. All was bare, ragged and deso-&#xD;
late, as though man had never before that evening passed the rocky&#xD;
threshold.&#xD;
The smuggler and Steve looked about them, and at each other, in&#xD;
erfect amazement, as the Hermit -paused in the centre of the cave, and&#xD;
held the torch above his head as if to illuminate every nook and angle&#xD;
more effectually, and give his guests an opportunity to note its dreary,&#xD;
comfortless appearance.&#xD;
They had both read and heard of hermits living in seclusion from&#xD;
all the world, in some lone cave, but they had never dreamed that&#xD;
any human -being could become so indifferent to the common necessi-&#xD;
ties of humanity, as to take up his abode, and dwell for fourteen years&#xD;
in a place so utterly destitute of everything that could conduce to&#xD;
comfort..&#xD;
The Hermit marked their looks of astonishment, and with a peculiar&#xD;
smile, as if he had read their thoughts, he observed-&#xD;
"This is only the vestibule of my residence, my friends. I should&#xD;
scarcely have ventured to invite you hither, had I not a less gloomy&#xD;
chamber than this for your reception. Come, let us go in;" and advanc-&#xD;
ing to a sharp angle of rock, ti the right of the first entrance, he drew&#xD;
aside a screen composed of a material similar to that which formed his&#xD;
robe, and so near the color of the rock itself, that it had escaped the&#xD;
notice of his visitors, disclosing, as he did so, another aperture even&#xD;
smaller than the one through which they had just passed.&#xD;
Following close in the footsteps of their mysterious guide, the little&#xD;
party traversed a narrow, winding passage for perhaps a hundred feet,&#xD;
when they suddenly emerged into another o amber more than five&#xD;
times as large as the first, but nothing near so lofty ; and if the&#xD;
smuggler and Steve Marvell were astonished at the barren and dreary&#xD;
appearance of the first apartment, they were perfectly bewildered at&#xD;
the air of comfort, almost sumptuousness, exhibited in this. Chairs,&#xD;
sofas, bureaus, tables, and other articles of furniture, were tastefully&#xD;
arranged about the apartment ; on the walls were hung several paist-&#xD;
ings of rare value ; on one side stood an open bookcase, the ample&#xD;
shelves of which were crowded with volumes, apparently in every&#xD;
style and variety of binding, and on the other was suspended a huge&#xD;
mirror in a rich gilded frame, so .tall that it might have reached&#xD;
from floor to ceiling of any modern parlor. Even the flinty floor was&#xD;
covered with a beautiful carpet, spread, as it would seem, upon a thick&#xD;
layer of leaves, for it was as elastic to the tread as the long velvet&#xD;
moss of some fairy dell. Everything within that subterranean cham-&#xD;
ber was arranged with the nicest care, and nothing that could minister&#xD;
to the physical or mental wants of man, seemed lacking. v&#xD;
Here the Hermit welcomed his guests to his home, and then, after&#xD;
showing them several other smaller chambers, one of which was fitted&#xD;
up for a sleeping apartment, ho returned with them to the "library,"&#xD;
&#xD;
Att&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAKE BRAVO.-o&#xD;
as he called the great chamber, where, after all were seated, he thus&#xD;
addressed them---&#xD;
" You are doubtless much surprised to see so much of comfort or&#xD;
rather the elements of comfort, in this lone and solitary retreat, m&#xD;
friends. You are the first and only human beings who have ever&#xD;
stepped within the precincts of these rocky walls, in the whole long time&#xD;
that I have been a resident of the cave ; and all who know me, 'adge of&#xD;
my in-door comforts by my out-door appearance. That these conehi-&#xD;
sions are unjust, this air of comfort with which you see I have invested&#xD;
my inner home, will bear witness. I am a hermit, it is true, but no&#xD;
anehoret ; and this garb which I have assumed, is'more for myown&#xD;
convenience than an exhibition of any religious or fanatical sentiment.&#xD;
These few articles of furniture are but a small remnant of a once&#xD;
princely establishment, of which I was the happy and envied pos-&#xD;
sessor. They were brought here during the first year of my sojourn&#xD;
in the cave, and removed from the vessel which brought them, during&#xD;
the mght; so that when the craft in which they came departed no one&#xD;
but myself was aware that my dark, silent home here, contained a&#xD;
sngle comfort othar than those provided by the hand of nature.&#xD;
. My fourteen years experience his taught me that solitude is not&#xD;
incompatible with comfort."&#xD;
Edith has listened very attentively while the Hermit was  eakin&#xD;
and when he ceased, she left her seat, and going over to him, she threw&#xD;
her arms about his neck, and looking down into his eyes as she ben&#xD;
over his shoulder, she addressed him in a manner so rational that at&#xD;
first the smuggler, Steve, and even the Hermit himself hoed  ad&#xD;
almost believed, that reason had again asserted her empire, and th&#xD;
maiden. was freed from the curse of madness---a              t&#xD;
"Will you not let -me live with you here in your quiet, beatiful&#xD;
home ? she asked of the Hermit. "And you will permit ne tcall&#xD;
you father, too, won't you ?  I have no parents, no home now and&#xD;
noble, kind brother, who would have died for me, they have taken him&#xD;
and shut him up in a cold, gloomy prison. 0, you will let me be y&#xD;
daughter, and I will love you so much I I will never be wicked ag r&#xD;
and run away, as I did from brother."agan,&#xD;
"What answer shaHl I make her 7" inquired the Hermit as the gir&#xD;
came sent. "I would say yes--shall ave your assent?" andhis&#xD;
eyeshglanced first at the smuggler and then at Steve, as though he&#xD;
sought his answer from some tell-tale expression of their features,&#xD;
rather than from their lips.         eres,&#xD;
In an instant the brave old smuggler and the warm-hearted sail&#xD;
were wringing his hands, and pouring forth their thanks for thus kindly&#xD;
offering to the poor girl an asylum, which of all others seemed bes&#xD;
calculated to finally restore her to reason.&#xD;
So it was all settled, and at an early hour on the following mor&#xD;
they all set to work removing the furniture which had been taken g,&#xD;
e cottage, to the Cave. This task occupied them two whole daysand&#xD;
on the morning of the third, Johnson and Steve sailed for Frend&#xD;
Creek,1n the yacht, promising to return as soon as Benjamin Le c&#xD;
freed from prison.                                    netts was&#xD;

Two months--two long anxious months, to some of our characters--.&#xD;
have gone by since the events which are recorded in the foregoing&#xD;
chapter occurred. Two months since the morning that the beautiful&#xD;
yacht sailed from Genesee River, and in all that time, not one word&#xD;
has Edith .or the mysterious white-haired Hermit heard from their&#xD;
absent friends. It has been a weary two months to them.&#xD;
Two months have the two prisoners, Stanly Morris and Benjamin&#xD;
Letts, languished there in their cold, damp cells, chained like wild&#xD;
beasts to the granite floor ; the one. driven almost to frenzy by the&#xD;
knowledge of his sister's wrongs ; and the other equally frantic with&#xD;
the torture of his galling fetters, and the thought that the glorious&#xD;
creature whom he had rescued from a ruffian's grasp. and whom he had&#xD;
so soon learned to worship, even as the Aztec does his sun-deity, was&#xD;
aill exposed to the detested wiles of that base wretch, and the baser&#xD;
libertine who urged him on. With them--shut out as they were from&#xD;
the society of those they loved, from the world and God's own glcr:ous&#xD;
sunlight-days lengthened into months, and months into years.. 0, it&#xD;
was a sad, tedious time to them, that two months !&#xD;
For twice thirty days, and as many nights, have the two sworn&#xD;
friends-the noble old smuggler and the true-hearted sailor, Steve&#xD;
Marvell--planned and, schemed, and watched, almost incessantly, for&#xD;
some favoring opportunity to make one bold effort for the liberty of&#xD;
their imprisoned friends. But the authorities are too vigilant, the&#xD;
strong prison is too strictly guarded, and- all their schemes thus far&#xD;
have proved abortive. It has been a restless, anxious two mouths to&#xD;
them.&#xD;
For eight whole weeks have that brace of scoundrels-the libertine&#xD;
Colonel, and his fiendish accomplice, Oliver Shephard-gone on plot-&#xD;
ting and conspiring in their dark career of villany and crime, exulting&#xD;
in their success, lamenting their failures, and marking new victims for&#xD;
their future prey. It has been a busy, exciting two months to them.&#xD;
'T'is early morning, on one of the first days of August, 1837.&#xD;
Everywhere, as you pass along through the streets of Kingston, you&#xD;
will see groups of people gathered here and there upon the sidewalks,&#xD;
in the market-place, along the wharves and upon the steps of the inns&#xD;
and hotels, all of whom seem to. be engaged in earnest conversation;&#xD;
Many of them, you will observe, cast furtive' glances occasionally at&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAKE BRAVO.-41&#xD;
those flaming government placards, posted up everywhere throughout&#xD;
the whole city, thick as theatre bills in the streets of New York.&#xD;
You wonder what it is that can have drawn these little crowds&#xD;
together at this early hour, till you approach one of the groups. and&#xD;
listen for a few moments, when the mystery becomes apparent. You&#xD;
learn that to-day, the first trial under the new government order is to&#xD;
take place. It is the day appointed for the trial of Benjamin Letts,&#xD;
accused of high treason.                -&#xD;
The time wears on. and at the hour of nine, you see crowds of peo-&#xD;
ple flocking towards the court-house, where the court of Queen's Bench-&#xD;
will soon be jn session.&#xD;
By a lucky chance you are mistaken for some government official&#xD;
and the dense throng in the square fall back on either hand, and allow&#xD;
you to pass. You enter with a dozen black-coated men, bearing long&#xD;
black wands, tipped with white ; one of them again taking you for a&#xD;
reporter, conducts you to a seat near the bar, where you have a most&#xD;
excellent chance to see and hear.&#xD;
Those three " things" there in that elevated seat, huge, unshapely&#xD;
black bags, with monstrous fleeces of wool. or something very like it on&#xD;
their heads, are the august judges of the Queen's Bench.&#xD;
You see that long oval table there, within the railed inclosure ?  It&#xD;
is covered with green cloth, and strewed with legal papers and many&#xD;
a calf-bound volume, and surrounded by some thirty members of the&#xD;
Midland District Bar.&#xD;
The jurors are all there in their seats, within that raised box there&#xD;
to the left of the judge's bench ; but you look in vain for the prisoner,&#xD;
Benjamin Letts. You are anxious, as are a thousand others, to look&#xD;
upon the first victim of foul conspiracy and colonial tyranny.&#xD;
There is a moment of profound silence, suddenly broken by a-low&#xD;
murmur, that thrills into sharp hissing whispers along the avenues of&#xD;
the lower hall, and swells into articulate words along and above the&#xD;
sea of heads in the vast circular gallery.&#xD;
A small door near the judge's seat opens, and, guarded between two&#xD;
bailiffs, the prisoner is brought in--a fair-haired, blue-eyed young&#xD;
man, whose cheeks are blanched with grief, and the noisome atmos-&#xD;
phere of a damp cell. But there is a firm elasticity in his free, bold&#xD;
step, a fire in his clear, blue eyes, that no fetters can subdue, no Cold&#xD;
dungeon can quench.&#xD;
He is placed in the dock, and silence is again proclamed. The jury-,&#xD;
done by one, are sworn to "well and truly try the case between our&#xD;
sovereign lady, the Queen, by the grace of God, &amp;amp;e, and the prisoner&#xD;
at the bar." At a signal from the judge, the clerk reads the indict.&#xD;
inent, and then, after a momentary pause, comes the question of "guilty&#xD;
or not guilty ?" to which the prisoner replies, in a clear, manly voice&#xD;
-4 NOT GUILTY !" and the mockery of.justice is begun.&#xD;
One after another, twenty suborned witnesses are brought to the&#xD;
stand, each one of whom would swear away the life of an innocent man&#xD;
for ten shillings sterling, and came there well tutored to swear, that&#xD;
Benjamin Letts is a traitor to his country.&#xD;
Papers and letters, bearing his name, and of treasonable import. each&#xD;
one of which has been carefully written and signed by the arch villain,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7541-00000022"/>&#xD;
42            THE EMPRESS OF THE ISLES' OR,&#xD;
-Oliver Shephard, are produced in court, and read to the jury, who&#xD;
already begin to frown, and several of them look the verdict which is&#xD;
to follow.&#xD;
The evidence on the part of the Crown is all given in, and the&#xD;
prisoner is called upon for his defence.&#xD;
All is hushed as death, as he rises to his feet; and after gazing for a&#xD;
moments in silence around the crowded court, he turns to the judge,&#xD;
and very calmly declares that he has no defence to make.&#xD;
After an able and most eloquent argument, by the attorney for the&#xD;
Crown, the judge delivered his charge to the jury, who, without retir-&#xD;
ing from their seats, rendered a verdict of 'guilty," and the prisoner is&#xD;
asked if he has anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced&#xD;
against him.&#xD;
Again he stands up in the dock, and after calling upon God to&#xD;
witness his innocence-of even a treasonable thought-he turned his&#xD;
deep blue eyes, now flashing with intense feeling, full upon the presid-&#xD;
ing judge, and assuming an attitude, as full of natures dignity, as&#xD;
sublime as that of Coriolanus, when he hurled his bitter denunciations&#xD;
upon the Roman Senate, he addressed the court in tones of impassion-&#xD;
ed eloqueince:&#xD;
" You ask me what I have got to say,*why sentence should not be&#xD;
pronounced against me, and I answer--nothing ! Still I have a few&#xD;
thoughts of which I would disburden my indignant heart before I leave&#xD;
this court. What my sentence will be, or how much what I am about&#xD;
to say may incline you to add to its severity, I know not, nor do I care&#xD;
-confident as I am, that if there were a doom in the human code&#xD;
worse than death, that doom would be mine. -&#xD;
" I have said that I am innocent. I repeat it. But this avails me&#xD;
nothing. - By forged papers and perjured witnesses, I have been con-&#xD;
demned ; by a jury of my countrymen, I have been pronounced guilty,&#xD;
and whatever I might say, my doom, so far as human agency can con-&#xD;
trol it, is sealed.&#xD;
" I ask no mercy at your hands, nor pity from a few, perhaps, who&#xD;
know me-and know my wrongs. Why should I, when for the first&#xD;
there is no hope, and the latter would be unavailing ?&#xD;
"1I have been arrested at the instigation of the vilest, blackest hearted&#xD;
wretch that ever wore the livery of humanity. For two whole months&#xD;
I have been chained there in one of the most dreary cells of your for-&#xD;
tress dungeon. My sister, a pure, gentle girl, and the only being I&#xD;
ever loved, has been torn from her happy home by the same accursed.&#xD;
villain who has planned, and thus far wrought my own ruin. My name,&#xD;
hitherto untainted by dishonor, has been rendered infamous ; the same&#xD;
tribunal that passes upon me my own doom, will also declare my prop-&#xD;
erty confiscated, and in the same hour I become a beggar-felon--cone&#xD;
vict I And the catiff villain who has made me thus, revels in wealth&#xD;
that was but lately mine.&#xD;
" And now, listen to my oath, which, if God spares my life, shall be&#xD;
most faithfully kept :-You may consign me to your deepest, strongest&#xD;
dungeons-load me down with iron till no space remains on my limbs&#xD;
to place a fetter-chain mre to the solid walls, or send me to your far-&#xD;
off penal colonies, if ye will-but ye cannot, shall not, keep me. Though&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAKE BRAVO.                        48&#xD;
ye buried me in a subterranean prison deeper than, the Cornish mines,&#xD;
or place me upon a lone rock, separated from the Canadas by the width&#xD;
of ten Atlantics, yet I will escape and wreak a terrible vengeance on&#xD;
those who have made me what I am.&#xD;
" Here I fling from me, forever, the hated name of ' British subject,'&#xD;
and by' Him who rules in heaven, I swear, that henceforth, while I&#xD;
live, every energy of my heart shall be devoted to hate and vengeance&#xD;
on all and everything that bears the British name !&#xD;
"If your injustice has changed the quiet,,.unoffenaing citizen into a&#xD;
reckless, blood-thirsty bravo, God, if man does not, will place the credit&#xD;
where 'tis due.&#xD;
And now, your sentence : I am ready !"&#xD;
The young man folds his arms, and stands there proudly in the&#xD;
dock, awaiting his doom. The stern judge rises and lifts his right&#xD;
hand, but ere a sound comes forth from his parted lips, a hum of many&#xD;
voices, at first low and indistinct, but gradually swelling into audible&#xD;
whispers, mingled with words of admiration, exclamations of pity, and&#xD;
smothered curses, goes up from aisle and gallery, until every nook and&#xD;
corner of the vast edifice is vocal with the indignant outbursts of popu-&#xD;
lar excitement.&#xD;
At length the tumult is hushed, and all listen with the most intense&#xD;
feeling, as the sentence falls word by word, slowly uttered, as, if to&#xD;
make it more emphatic, from the lips of the Judge-&#xD;
Transportation for Life!'&#xD;
It would have been death, but that stern old man dared not speak&#xD;
it. He saw the-slumbering fire in the eyes of more than five hundred&#xD;
determined men, and he knew that such a sentence would be the signal&#xD;
for a demonstration that neither the government nor himself were pre-&#xD;
pared for.&#xD;
But transportation is not murder, and it did not seem like death ;&#xD;
wherefore, the crowd only hissed the court, and made threatening ges-&#xD;
tures at the Colonel, Oliver Shephard, and several of the witnesses;&#xD;
and several of them spoke kindly to the victim, as he was led out of&#xD;
the court to be conducted back to prison.&#xD;
When the result of the trial became known to the multitudes who&#xD;
had assembled in the court-house square and in the market-place,&#xD;
there was everywhere manifested signs of disappointment. Of the&#xD;
thousands who had thus collected together, there was probably not one&#xD;
in every five hundred but had hoped that the sentence would have&#xD;
been death ; for then they would have had just such a pretext as they&#xD;
earnestly longed for, to wrest the victim from the grasp of his persecu-&#xD;
tors, and show their contempt of the odious law which had so recently&#xD;
been promulgated.&#xD;
As it was, they quietly dispersed to their several homes, but with&#xD;
muttered threats and ominous glances at the government placards, as&#xD;
they passed along the streets, which told very plainly, that a few more&#xD;
such acts of legal outrage would rouse the latent fires of discontent into&#xD;
the fierce blaze of revolution.&#xD;
Benjamin Letts was conducted, under a strong guard, from the court&#xD;
back to his gloomy cell, where he was heavily ironed and chained to&#xD;

It was ten o'clock, or very near that hour, on the evening after the&#xD;
trial had taken place, and a gay festive party were assembled in the&#xD;
gorgeously appointed drawing-rooms of a stately mansion, which stood&#xD;
almost entirely alone on the out-skirts of the city, near the head of&#xD;
King street, the principal thoroughfare of the city of Kingston.&#xD;
The mansion is that of the Honorable Edward Vavasour, first Judge&#xD;
~ of the Court of Queen's Bench-he who presided but a few hours before&#xD;
at the trial of Letts.&#xD;
The party have assembled there to celebrate his daughter's birth-&#xD;
day.-&#xD;
A set of cotillion is just formed, and the dancers are only waiting&#xD;
for the music to strike up, when all At once a scene of the wildest con-&#xD;
fusion and dismay occurs. , Timid females scream with affright and&#xD;
cling to their partners for protection, or fall fainting to the floor.&#xD;
Brave 'nen--soldiers who have braved death even " at the cannon's&#xD;
mouth"--stand there in mute terror, and gaze upon an unknown mask,&#xD;
who stands with.folded arms two paces within the closed door. - No&#xD;
one knows him, or how he came there. He wears a light fustian hunt-&#xD;
ing coat, a common tarpaulin hat, and About his waist is a broad,&#xD;
leather belt, within which he wears'a long, serviceable-looking dagger,&#xD;
and a brace of heavy dragoon's pistols.&#xD;
Suddenly the strange being tears the mask from his face, and the&#xD;
next instant a dozen voices exclaim, with increased wonder-&#xD;
"Benjamin Letts!"&#xD;
" Ay--Ben -Letts-TDE BRAVo-Ha ! ha ! ha ! Judge, I told you&#xD;
that you could not keep me in your prisons. Do you believe me&#xD;
now ?"&#xD;
"Seize the desperado !" shouted the Judge, and a dozen sprang for-&#xD;
ward to execute the mandate, but the Bravo was gone.&#xD;

JUDGE YAVASOVa was the first to recover from the surprise--almost,&#xD;
stupor-into which the sudden appearance and mysterious exit of young&#xD;
Letts had thrown all that gay, happy party, and followed by more than.&#xD;
a dozen of .his military friends, he sallied forth into the hall, and then&#xD;
into the street ; but after a half hour's search about the grounds and&#xD;
questioning the servants, not one of whom.had seen or heard anything&#xD;
of the uninvited guest, they returned to the mansion, where a new sur-&#xD;
prise awaited them; for, as the judge .himself mounted the steps, and&#xD;
was about to re-enter the hall, his eye fell upon a white objecteeured&#xD;
to the outer side of the door, near the top, and instantly calling for a&#xD;
light, he, together with his friends, soon made out the white object to"&#xD;
be a piece of paste-board, nearly a foot square, secured to the door by&#xD;
four immense government wafers, bearing the colonial arms, and in the&#xD;
centre of the card were the words--&#xD;
" BEN. LETTS, T[E BRAVO."&#xD;
" Audacious villain I" exclaimed Judge Vavasour, quivering with rage&#xD;
and excitement.&#xD;
" Murderous miscreant !" muttered, between his hard-set teeth, a&#xD;
dandy young captain of the 79th Royal Highlanders.&#xD;
" Fly to the barracks and arouse the whole garrison this- instant !"&#xD;
shouted a gray-whiskered colonel of artillery, who was himself an inti-&#xD;
mate friend of Col. Moody.&#xD;
" You, Captains Edmiston, Bancroft, and Carlisle, and Lieut. Gar-&#xD;
wood, hurry to the prison, and learn by what means the convict-traitor&#xD;
has escaped. I will at once to the quarters of Col. Moody, and ere an&#xD;
hour has passed, every outlet from the city shall be guarded, and five&#xD;
thousand men shall be-on the. trail. He cannot escape; and orders.&#xD;
shall be given to all to shoot the desperado down like a dog wherever&#xD;
he shall be found."&#xD;
. In five minutes the mansion of Judge Vavasour was deserted by its&#xD;
military guests, and in less than an hour the streets of Kingston pre-&#xD;
sented a scene of bustle and wild confusion, quite equal to that which&#xD;
had taken place two months previously, when it became known that&#xD;
the notorious smuggler-and pirate was in their midst.&#xD;

46-           THE EMPRESS OF ,THE ISLES; OR,&#xD;
The military deputation which had bocok sent to investigate the&#xD;
prison, found on their arrival, the two soldiers on guard, the door of&#xD;
the cell locked and secured ; and they were informed by the sentinels&#xD;
that all had been quiet within the cell during the time that they had&#xD;
been on guard.&#xD;
When the turnkey was aroused, and the door at length flung open,&#xD;
the officers were struck with astonishment, as they entered the narrow-&#xD;
cell and saw the massive fetters, so lately worn by the prisoner, piled&#xD;
up. in the centre of the little apartment, and surmounted by a card&#xD;
similar to the one they had just seen on the door of the Vavasour man-&#xD;
sion, only on this was written---&#xD;
" Presented to the Government, by BEN. LnETTs, THE BRAVO."&#xD;
All around the'cell were scattered narrow strips of flannel cloth,&#xD;
which still gave forth the odor of nitric acid, empty vials, and stout iron&#xD;
bars, which had been removed from the grated window-and, upon a&#xD;
closer examination, several tiny saws, and other implements used by&#xD;
burglars and adepts in iron cutting ; all of which was conclusive ev1-&#xD;
dunce not only of the means which the prisoner had made use of to&#xD;
escape, but that those means had been supplied from without, and&#xD;
long before the trial, as it was impossible that he could have cut&#xD;
through those strong bars, and the rivets which secured his fetters, in&#xD;
one evening.&#xD;
As the officers examiined the irons which had so recently graced the&#xD;
prisoner's limbs,-there was one circumstance which very much puzzled&#xD;
and astonished them, as it doubtless will the, reader, who, if he will&#xD;
bear the incident in mind, will find a solution of the mystery in one of&#xD;
the last chapters of this veritable history. The circumstance was this-&#xD;
the "hand-cuffs" which had secured his wrist, were found removed entire,&#xD;
without the rivets being out.&#xD;
When the artillery colonel reached the quarters of his friend, Col.&#xD;
Moody, the first object that met his gaze was another of those paste-&#xD;
board placards affixed to the door by a bayonet, which was driven&#xD;
through the centre, deep into the panel, as though the very energy&#xD;
which drove the weapon home, spoke the vengeance of the will and&#xD;
arm that wielded it.&#xD;
By the light of a street lamp, which stood almost in front of the-&#xD;
door, the officer read-&#xD;
"1Deth to the Libertine !--BEN. LETTs."&#xD;
Col. Moody was aroused from a very interesting conference with his&#xD;
colleague in villany, upon the subject of some legal papers relative to&#xD;
his newly-acquired property-i. e., the beautiful cottage and grounds&#xD;
so lately owned by young Letts, and which he had received from the&#xD;
government as his share of the spoils. He was aroused, I say, by the&#xD;
abrupt entrance of his artillery friend ; and when he was made ac-&#xD;
quainted with the fact that his victim had escaped, his rage was&#xD;
unbounded. But his fiendish rage was fully equalled by his guilty&#xD;
fears, when the menacing placard was pointed out to him, as in com-&#xD;
pany with his fellow officer he left the quarters to muster his command,&#xD;
and hurry them off in search of the escaped convict.&#xD;
All throughout the night the hue and cry was kept up, but no further&#xD;
traces of the self-liberated prisoner were discovered, when, just as the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE LAKE BRAVO.&#xD;
day began to dawn, a detachment of-dragoons, who had been dispatched&#xD;
to the cottage on the bayashore, returned to Kingston with theintelli&#xD;
gene that the beautiful villa and every building connected with it, had&#xD;
been burned during the night, and that on their arrival they had found&#xD;
another of the Bravo's cards fastened to the gate of the lawn.&#xD;
Ten days passed, and the most diligent search continued for the&#xD;
escaped, when the authorities and everybody else in Kingston were&#xD;
startled one morning by the intelligence from Toronto, that a govern-&#xD;
nent warehouse in that city, containing a large amount of valuable&#xD;
property had just been burned, and all around the neighborhood, those&#xD;
mysterious cards bearing the words BEN LETTS, THE BRAVO, had been&#xD;
posted up.&#xD;
Some three weeks after this last event occurred, a very genteel&#xD;
-appearing old gentleman,-dressed in the very extreme of the beau monde,&#xD;
and wearing a profusion of rich jewelry, landed one morning from an&#xD;
American steamer which had just entered the harbor of Kingston, from&#xD;
Oswego, on the American side.&#xD;
The stranger in his appearance was just such a person as Sir Walter&#xD;
Scott presents to our view in his description of the "lion-hearted mon-&#xD;
arch of England," Richard, the first Plantagenet. He wore no whiskers&#xD;
or moustache, which might have given cause for the supposition, but&#xD;
then his dark, bronzed -skin, jet black hair, and dark, flashing eyes,&#xD;
added to the circumstance of his being accompanied by a--negro slave,&#xD;
almost as richly dressed as his master, led several of the travelled&#xD;
Canadians who had assembled on the wharf, to assert very positively&#xD;
that he was either a rich Cuban Spaniard, or perhaps a titled Don from&#xD;
old Spain; but when they saw the negro superintend the removal from&#xD;
the steamer of two magnificent horses, whose very step proclaimed&#xD;
their pure blood and careful training, they remembered that the Mid-&#xD;
land District races were to commence in a few days, and then they set&#xD;
the stranger down, past all question, as a Southern sporting gentleman,&#xD;
who had brought those superb animals to match them against the&#xD;
"Buglers," " Flatas," and " Lady Hartleys,"-of Canada.&#xD;
In this last surmise they were correct ; for the stranger repaired to&#xD;
the most fashionable hotel in the city, and after seeing his horses well&#xD;
cared for, he entered his name and those of his retinue, horses and all,&#xD;
thus-&#xD;
" Gen. - Percival Winchester, Arkansas.&#xD;
" Quickstep-bl'k g'ng-,-out of Queen Mab.&#xD;
" Ruttven-b'y st'en-out of Diana--.s'd by Harrold.&#xD;
" Marcus-bl'k boy-serv't---age 30-slave."&#xD;
It told its own story plainly enough, that entry did: it spoke vol-&#xD;
umes of itself. First himself, then his horses, and last of all his negro&#xD;
slave.&#xD;
"Monstrous !" exclaimed a genteelly dressed man, glancing over the&#xD;
register, as the stranger turned his back. " Monstrous !" he reiterated,&#xD;
in a louder tone, as the southerner walked to one of the windows, and&#xD;
stood gazing out into the street.&#xD;
" Characteristic of those chivalrous southerners, who claim to be the&#xD;
children of liberty, and the champions of human rights. The very&#xD;
term 'American Liberty' is a gross libel upon the name of -humanity.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7541-00000025"/>&#xD;
48            THE EMPRESS :09 TE' T  ISLES; OR,&#xD;
here is -a just spe-imen of those United States Liberty braggarts; who&#xD;
traffic in human fleh, and wh6 degrade their fellow man below The&#xD;
lever of the brute creation, because forsooth the-acQident of nature has&#xD;
given him a skin of a different color from the tyrant w'ho calls him&#xD;
slave."&#xD;
Thus spoke the genteelly dressed man, with his finger upon the&#xD;
southerner's entry in the register, and half soliloquizing half apostro-&#xD;
phizing in a low tone to-a few persons who stood near him.&#xD;
You would set this man down as a true philanthropist, and a genuine&#xD;
friend of humanity ; but the next moment you see how egregiously you&#xD;
have been mistaken in him, for he turns his face towards us,and you&#xD;
recognize the smooth, hypocritical features of the villian lawyer-spy-&#xD;
Oliver Shephard.&#xD;
As he turns from the desk, his eyes encounter the form of the negro,&#xD;
who is standing in a distant corner of the large apartment, and going&#xD;
over to him, he makes a motion as if to shake hands with the slave, who&#xD;
steps back and lifts his hat respectfully as the subtle lawyer thus ad-&#xD;
dresses him-&#xD;
" Good morning, my friend. You have come to Kingston, I presume,&#xD;
to attend the races ?"°&#xD;
"No, bah, dat I dusn't, Massa ober dar-cum heah to 'tend dem&#xD;
race--dis child cam to 'tend..Massa and bosses." -   .      :&#xD;
" You are a slave, I pissume ?"&#xD;
" Yes sah, dat I is. Mighty good one too, I reckon ; spec Massa&#xD;
won't take twenty hundred dollars for dis nigger."-&#xD;
"What is your name?"&#xD;
" Marcus, sah; -haiu't got no moah name. Massa say one name&#xD;
plenty for nigger. Sometime when go trabbel, hab Massa's name-&#xD;
Iarcus Winchester."-.                                       '&#xD;
" But, Marcus, don't you know that it is degrading to be a slave ?"&#xD;
"Dere's whar you're 'staken, 'tirely, Massa. Dis nigger neber 'grade&#xD;
nothin ; no, sah.! When cum up de ribber 'long wid Massa dis time,&#xD;
seed plenty white men 'gradin on de lebbee, dar in Simsunnatti-yah !&#xD;

all got big chain -on; all same like ox. Tell you, sab, nigger doan't do&#xD;
dat down Sout dar."&#xD;
" You don't quite understand me, Marcus. I mean that so long as&#xD;
you are a slave, you are crushed down to the level of the brutes, de-&#xD;
prived of all the inalienable rights which God has given to man, with a&#xD;
design that they should be free and equal everywhere."&#xD;
" I b'leve you is right dar, Massa. Now, I spect dat de general lub&#xD;
dem losses better'n he does dis child-; den oh course, I is below-'em.&#xD;
But den you see, sah, dat Massa am a sportin' gent'luni, and ob course,&#xD;

"Yes; but don't you know you are not allowed to vote, nor-"&#xD;
" What de debble bote good for ?  Massa bote ebery timedis ten-&#xD;
twenty year ; and he say he lose he bote ebry year. What bote good&#xD;

What the event would have been, had- not the General,:whose atten-&#xD;
tio .head been for some time directed towards his slave, immediately&#xD;
interfered, is altogether-a matter:of (doubt, for Marcus had.fiung=aside&#xD;

while his-master went-the roundsof'the prison.-&#xD;
'his prisoner was Lieut. Stanly Morris.&#xD;
One day after these prison visits had continued se long, and become&#xD;
so regular, that everybody about the hotel had become 'accustomed t6&#xD;
seeing. the GeneraLstart off accompanied-by his servant and a soldier&#xD;
and return in the, same. manner, often after dark. A' beautiful little&#xD;
schooner; painted as bhte all over as the: heavens; without a single&#xD;
streak of spek. of any-other colors about- her, arrived at the -whartf&#xD;
known as the "Mrs. McLeod,"'next below the foot of King street.&#xD;
An l that same evening, at the! hour of sunset, there was a' strange&#xD;
scene enacted in the corridor of the prison in which Stanly Morris was&#xD;
The other prisoners had.all been lookedih their cells for the' ight,&#xD;
and the General, who had remained longer' than usual in the prison,&#xD;
was conversing with' the soldier, wbile Marcusdand Stanlysseeune tobe&#xD;
discussing some aneomnonlj interesting subject}/and 'the' turnkey stood&#xD;
a littloepart,'patiently waiting for the. oung Lieutenant to. conclude&#xD;
his discour'e.      '&#xD;
. Suddenly, as if by a preconcerted' signal, the General grasped the&#xD;
soldier. by the. throat, almost 'crashing him in' his giant graip, at the&#xD;
same instant that .the:-athletic negra sprang upon: the unsuspecting&#xD;
turakeywhom' he'cught up in his arms as if he had been/lan infant.&#xD;

feited the soldier most admirably in passing along the streets, so that&#xD;
they escaped observation till they arrived' at the hotel, where it was so&#xD;
x   very common to see a soldier passing out and.in at all hours. on some&#xD;
errand for the various officers, that, it is probable the sailor-soldier might&#xD;
have passed fifty times in 9pen daylight, ands not been detected ; but&#xD;
the General determine  to act with the utmost caution: and so upon&#xD;
entering te hQtel,.he ,_ok Stanly immediately up o his prirate'roomy&#xD;
andin less than ten minutes his epidier's dress was exchanged for a&#xD;
'post fashionable suit that had been procured several days previously,&#xD;
expressly for the occasion,&#xD;
The General had already settled his:bill,-and his baggage had been&#xD;
sent away aboard of an American steamer on the day previous, and as&#xD;
soon as Stanly was ready, they passed out into the street, accompanied&#xD;
by Marcus; and before Aive minutes more had elapsed,,they all three&#xD;
stood upon the deck of the magnificent little blue clipper, which was&#xD;
immediately -got ander,'weigh---and, with' a fine, fresh bremio td tike&#xD;

ByRON's ALBANIA;t&#xD;
&#xD;
HAVING, by the merest accident, (for honestly, it was not by design;&#xD;
got four-of our principal characters together on board our favorite little&#xD;
yacht, I am somewhat doubtful. about leaving them there alone in the'&#xD;
schooner, particularly as it is night, and blowing rather fresh; besides,&#xD;
they have not decided as yet which way they will steer, and if *e'&#xD;
should lose sight of them now, don't you see it might take us a long'&#xD;
time to hunt them up when we want their services again ; and then, as&#xD;
this, is rather a history of those'stirring times on the frontier, as all&#xD;
who 'shall read it and are well informed upon'; the subject will vouch,&#xD;
rather than a kiud.of-" hop-skip," Wandering Jew novel, it will ber-&#xD;
tainly appear more in character to keep dates, characters and events all'&#xD;
along together, as nearly as circumstances will permit: wherefore, '&#xD;
propose that we keep in company with the yacht till she inaken a&#xD;
harbor somewhere.                   =&#xD;
Recollecting,' thenthat Bill Johnson, alias Gen. Winchester;- Mar-&#xD;
cus, the slave,, alias Steve Marvell; Ben. Letts, the Bravo, 'and ,Stahly&#xD;
Morris, the young Lieutenant so lately rescued from prison,'are  there-&#xD;
together in the cabin of the little blue schooner, which is some t ehty&#xD;
miles outside the harbor of Kingston, with the breeze fresh from the&#xD;
northward, we will, if you please, stow ourselves away in soni quiet&#xD;
nook about the cabin, where we can both see and hear, until we learn&#xD;
the decision of the council of four, who are about to determine the&#xD;
present destination of the schooner and themselves.&#xD;
" Well, Capt. Letts," exclaimed the smuggler, who is the first to&#xD;
open the subject, "what do you say ?  Shall we haul her to, by the&#xD;
wind, as soon as we are clear of Charity Shoals ?  We can fetch Gren.&#xD;
adier Island, you know, and lay. there snug in .Basin Harbor, till this&#xD;
wind dies away and comes out fair from some other quarter, when we&#xD;
can run down the river to French Creek, in three or four hours. I&#xD;
suppose our young friend here is quite as impatient to see one or two&#xD;
of his friends at the Creek, and his own beautiful Island near by, as I&#xD;
-am to see my family, from whom I have been absent much longer than&#xD;
I intended."&#xD;
'"I don't think we shall gain much by standing across for the islands,"&#xD;
replied the commander of the craft; " it is blowing very strong, and we&#xD;
can carry but little canvas by the wind ; besides, we shall find an ugly&#xD;

.then, don't gou remember-Capt:Ben,-that yu and'I-°sworeto Miss&#xD;
Kate to 'bring Stanly back with .us within twenty-four hours after we&#xD;
should get him outside that old stone hulk? ?Ad now&#xD;

quick sea, tol4 'plainly enought to those inthe' cabinthat she was hauled&#xD;
to head to the eastward, while-the trapip 'of busy- feet on desk;'the&#xD;
creaking of blocks, and the flapping slfck pf canvas, which lasted for&#xD;
a teW minutes,4old equally plain that the 'little being was got under&#xD;
snug sail.&#xD;
Before twelve o'clock, the breeze, which here seldom holds on to the&#xD;
o rthward for any great length of 'time; especiallyduri ngthe sutmer&#xD;
months began to die away.and veer round to 'the westward, so that' by&#xD;
two o'eiodk on 'the morning that the yacht left Kingston, she was' head.&#xD;
ing'up N.-E., fair between the two lights which mark, duiing-the 'night,&#xD;
the 'entrance on' the American'aide of the river ,t. Lawrence;' and&#xD;
before 'two hours more- had -gone by;-the little, schooner' was gliding&#xD;
along down the strong current of the beautiful river; close in with" the&#xD;
shore in the American channel ; 'and as hour, perhaps, after sunrise,&#xD;
the yacht was moored in' a snug little rocky cove on the eastern side&#xD;
of Washington Island, within. two hundred yards' of thf smuggler's&#xD;
home.J'St&#xD;
'As 'I have already remarked, at the commencement of' this chapter,&#xD;
mine is rather a history of those times than a romantic' novel, and I&#xD;
shall on that account have nothin  to say relative to the:meeting of&#xD;
Stanly Morris and the beautiful' Kate, leaving the reader to imagine&#xD;
just such a scene as under the circumstances would seemh most natural.&#xD;
But I 'mtist' pause for a 'fer moments to 'glance at' a scene which&#xD;
occurred on the beautiful little islet described in the first chapter,' and&#xD;
which' the reader will recollect as Linda's' Island, on the. second day&#xD;
after the arrival of the yacht at the home of the smuggler.'&#xD;

from the time she sailed from Kingston till she wassafely moored in&#xD;

the island, alongside of the willow-clad bank, as quiet and gracefu as&#xD;
a slumbering naiad ; while beside the lone grave kneels 'thejheroiand&#xD;
heroine ofthe drama-Stanly Morris, the rescued prisonerr, e-lieu-&#xD;
tenant of the British Navy-son of the unknown recluse ;.and that&#xD;
superb creature-the village pet, Catharine Johnson-the ,'daughter&#xD;
of the notorious smuggler, Bill Johnsoa-Kate, the future EMg sF o&#xD;

With clasped hands,'eyes upraised to heaven, and arms gently en-&#xD;
circling each other's waists, they kneel there--there, beside the island&#xD;
grave-and plight to each other their solemn, their nist saicredfaith ;&#xD;
and as th- lovers can very well dispense with our company, we will&#xD;
leave them there to heaven and themselves, while we 'take hurried&#xD;
glance at the times and condition of thing in Canada at.that period.&#xD;
For several years the liberal, or, as it was called in 'Canada, radical&#xD;
party, had been gradually gaining ground, particularly in, what{was&#xD;
then the Upper Province, where the constant and gowinnteeourse&#xD;
with their near neighbors on the American side, had imbued tha people&#xD;
.with ideas of improvement and. government reform to such a degree&#xD;
that they determined. to ask boldly of not only the Colonial but the&#xD;
Government of Great Britain, for a redress, of many wrongs to which_&#xD;
they had hitherto patiently submitted, and among which were unjust&#xD;
taxation1unequal representation and several other abuses of which they&#xD;
knew that the people of Great ritain were free, and argued that those&#xD;
of the Colonies ought to be equally so.&#xD;
William Lyon McKenzie, the champion of radical reform in the&#xD;
West, and the proprietor of a public journal in Toronto, was denounced&#xD;
as a traitor, his paper suppessed by order of government, and'his press,&#xD;
together. with all his materials, to the amount of several thousan  dol-&#xD;
jars, were destroyed;&#xD;
This high-handed act of tyranny, coupled with previous abuses,&#xD;
aroused the slumbering spirit of a people naturally quiet, and every-&#xD;
where a final resort.to arms began to be whispered among all classes of&#xD;
society. An indignation meeting was called in the city of Toronto, peo-&#xD;
ple cameinby thousands from. the surrounding country, gathered in the&#xD;
Market Square, and the excitement became. intense. The roof of the&#xD;
market house, densely covered with people, fell in, several were killed,&#xD;
many were.horribly mangled, and the "murder" was foolishly charged&#xD;
upon the government.                         .    .&#xD;
In the L9wer Province Papineau was marshaling his forces ; but&#xD;
with the French habitans, iess acyainted with republicanism than the&#xD;
people of Upper Canada, and calculated by nature to rest content under&#xD;
any government, he was much less successful than McKenzie. in the&#xD;
West&#xD;

And doubly barbed the;shaft we wore&#xD;
Deep in each bleeding heart of beart.&#xD;
ALARIC A. WArrg.-&#xD;
Foa three days had the rescued prisoner, Stanly Morris, together!&#xD;
with his two friends, Young Letts and the noble sailor Steve Marvell,&#xD;
remained the guests of Johnson, the smuggler, during Which -tiie&#xD;
Stanly and Kate had been almost constantly together, conve-sing of&#xD;
the past, enjoying the present, and drawing glorious dream-pictures of&#xD;
the future ; when Kate, who had been intently listening to Steve's ao-&#xD;
count of the Hermit's cave, and-the wild scenery-about it, suddenly-left&#xD;
her seat, and going over to where Stanly was engaged.in conversation&#xD;
with her father; took his arm and led 'him from the house; and along&#xD;
a narrow, rugged path, which wound ainong.the rocks, until they reach-&#xD;
ed a retired. spot; formed by a projecting ledge, and shaded by a few-&#xD;
dwarf pines, the only trees on the barren, 'ocky islet; seated herself&#xD;
upon a rude bench, and motioning Stanly to a place beside her, thus&#xD;
addressed him-&#xD;
aO 'Stanly! I have' thought so much about that poor maniac: girl-&#xD;
there in the cave. - Day .and night, ever since my father and Steve,&#xD;
returned from Genesee, more than two months ago, that poor girl and&#xD;
her sorrows have been constantly in my mind. At night, inniy sleep&#xD;
I dream of ier ; and in my waking hours it seems as if nmy spirit held&#xD;
communion with "her's, till next to you and my parents, I love her better&#xD;
than any one else on earth. I have been thinking how much better it&#xD;
would be for her to be here with me, than shut up there in that dark,&#xD;
gloomy cave. I would love her so, and take her with me in my little&#xD;
boat, when I go over to our beautiful island yonder.' 0, it would.&#xD;
be' such a pleasure 'for me to sing to her, and 'show her all the wild,&#xD;
beautiful scenery among these fairy islands 1' I know, Stanly,,that L&#xD;
can charm away her madness, and bring, happiness back, once more&#xD;
to her bleeding heart. And then, dear Stanly, when we are--"&#xD;
The beautiful girl hesitated, turned away her face and blushed crim-&#xD;
son, but a moinent afterwards she recovered her self-possession, and.&#xD;
looking -archly up into her lover's eyes, she spoke the words withqt*&#xD;
faltering-'                                             ",&#xD;

And now; what w']Ia-it to ask you- is this --Ben amin Letts and&#xD;
Stephen are to sail to-morrow in the schooner for Genesee River; will&#xD;
you go with them, Stanly, and endeavor to persuade Letts to bring&#xD;
Edith here, or let her come with you ?"&#xD;
" Heaven bless you ! Angel thiat you are," exclaimed Stanly, as&#xD;
he embraced the noble, generous hearted girl; "bless you for the&#xD;
thought, Kate.  It is just. wl t I haye been thinking about ever since&#xD;
I have heard poor Edith's story., I wil[ speak to Letts about it.&#xD;
at once, and I have no doubt that he will gladly resign his unhappy&#xD;
sister to your sisterly care- for hieowi life wil henceforth-be-a wild,&#xD;
stormy one; ie has himself swordi it; and he will find little leisure to&#xD;
soothe and comfort the afflicted girl.&#xD;
" And now, my dear Kate, will ygu accompany, me to the good&#xD;
old minister's ?  If I am to go hence tomorrow, it is necessary that&#xD;
I should see him-.at-once, as I wish tQ give ;him instructions concern-&#xD;
ing a cottage.;which I have already authorized him to have built on&#xD;
the exact spot where my mother's stood ; and Kate, I wish you, as&#xD;
the future iiistress of our island, home,.to lavt the sole control of&#xD;
its-internal;ariangemeut; and.I will here make- you acquainted with&#xD;
secret which perhaps some very romantic lovers would, doubtless&#xD;
conceal till after marriage, which is, that the worthy old: pastor, Mr.&#xD;
Andrews, holds in trust for me, from my mother, nearly thirty thou-&#xD;
sand dollars in cash."-&#xD;
This knowledge, Stanly Morris," replied the true-hearted girl,&#xD;
" does not make, you.any dearerto me, or more worthy of my deepest, -&#xD;
holiest affections, But, thank you,.a thousand times thank you,.dear&#xD;
Stanly, for the confidence you.have thus placed in me.  And now,&#xD;
let us away to Mr. Andrews' at once, for I'm sure I shall never be&#xD;
quite satisfied till we have our poor Edith with us, and never quite&#xD;
happy. till we'are married, Stanly"-.-and this time the lovely girl spoke&#xD;
the word without hesitating ; and having thus settled the question&#xD;
with regard to the maniac maiden, they left their pine-shaded seat, and&#xD;
took their way towards the parsonage.      .&#xD;
t was 'some timne past nine o'clock when Stanly and Kate left the&#xD;
good old :minister, and after a few minutes' walk througli the quiet.&#xD;
streets of the village, they returned to the smuggler's residence, where&#xD;
Stanly immediately informed his friends of Kate's proposal, and asked'&#xD;
Letts if he waswilling that Edith .should become her companion, as she&#xD;
desired..&#xD;
"Am I willing !" exclaimed Letts, astonished at the question. " Why&#xD;
not ask me if I would be willing t be restored. to-or rather have all,'&#xD;
everything of which I hale been deprived, restored to rue; my sister&#xD;
first, and next to her,: her reason? $?ay God. forever bless you both,&#xD;
for your kindness to one who -has nothing bat his thanks left, to offer in&#xD;
roturn..&#xD;
it Was- accordingly agreed that Stanly should sail with Letts and&#xD;
$*h9e'ia the yacht, and return with Edith, while Letts himself declared&#xD;
#d d  "oeas he had, spen his sister safe under the protection of his&#xD;
friendshe would seek the first opportunity of returning to Canada, where,&#xD;

within-thirty miles of her desirnatio.&#xD;
ysThe harbor wis gained,'he-schooner waskpt on along up the  iid-'&#xD;

seen her; and here she was-again:secured to th4yold 'wharf after which&#xD;
the three friends entered into conversation to while away the time till&#xD;
daylight, as they did not choose to disturb the Hermitorhis charge'&#xD;
.   during the night. '  .&#xD;
In the morning; after waiting some time in the hopes that the Her-&#xD;
mit would make his appearance, they' left the 'schooner, Steve 1 ading&#xD;
the way, and began climbing up the rugged path that led'tie'thc ve&#xD;
Stanly and Letts declaring that it was the wildest, -mostdesolate look-&#xD;
ing place they had ever dreamed of.&#xD;
At'length the little plateau was gained, and Steve discovered that&#xD;
the entrance of the cave was carefully closed 'with the two pieces of&#xD;
U     plank, justas he had seen them when he first visited thespot, and the&#xD;
idea suggested itself to him iii a moment, that the Hermit was not&#xD;
in the cave, as he could not arrange the planks in that manner from&#xD;
within.&#xD;
Without, however, eammunicating his suspicious to his companions,&#xD;
he removed the planks and entered the cave; but all within was dak&#xD;
and silent as the- tomb.&#xD;
After a few moments' search, Steve found the curtain which con-&#xD;
cealed the passage leading to the inner cave, and taking Letts by the&#xD;
hand, who in his turn took that of 8tanly, they ill three groped their&#xD;
way slowly along through the intricate, uneven avenue, and finally&#xD;
emerged into the larger apartmevt,.where the darkness was so intense&#xD;
that it seemed tangible.&#xD;
For several moments they stood there inthe most profound silence,&#xD;
and then Steve ventured to speak Edith's nine aloud. But there was&#xD;
no response ; all remained as before, dark-dreary-silent. Again he&#xD;
called-." Edith 1"  Silence was his: only, answer.  Impatieritly, he&#xD;
shouted at the very'highest pitohtof his  voice-4 Edith l? and in an&#xD;
instant the name was yelled back in ten thousand echoes, and in tones&#xD;
so shrill, so terrific, that all clapped their hands upon their ears, to.&#xD;
shut out the painful vibrations.&#xD;
Like a cavern on one of the islands in lake Erie, the Genesee grotto&#xD;
possesses the property of giving back an echo only when a word is-&#xD;

rona underatood nothing of this phenomenonof nature, and were at first&#xD;
disposed toattribute these terrible sounds to some Infernal, orfat-least&#xD;
s crpaturat agency&#xD;
'Lfter a, few moinents, however, when they had somewhat.recoverd&#xD;
from. ilteir eudden .stupor, they began to grope aboutin the dark in&#xD;
senrc of something, they.scarcely -ksew:wbat, but feeling-as' though the&#xD;
very touch of some object., no matter-what, so that it ,wasa an object,&#xD;
uould drive ota superstitious dread, a cold, shuddering sensation of&#xD;
fear, which they felt.creeping over them.&#xD;
Before he had made half a dozen steps, Stanly stumbled against some&#xD;
fibect, which-he soop discovered, to be a table ; and almost at the same&#xD;
instant, his ani came in contact, first with a box of matches, and then&#xD;
a  iamp, bot. placed. near each other on the tablet&#xD;
The .lamp was soon lighted, and the: first object that met Stanly'sw&#xD;
eye, wasba letter which had, been placed beside the lamp, and which,"on&#xD;
examining it, he found ftobe directed,' in a tery elegant hand-westing,&#xD;
to " William Johnson, Esq.,.or Mr. Stephen Marvell."  -&#xD;
'C This must of course be for you, Steve, as the other person whose&#xD;
namesit"bears is not present,"asaid Stanly, handing the letter to Steve,&#xD;
who immediately opened it, and after poring over its contents for a few&#xD;
moments, handed it back to Stanly, requesting him to read it, observing&#xD;
at the saume time, that he could read bunting a great deal better than&#xD;
he could iminusoript.&#xD;
,Sanly tookthe letter, and read aloud as follows:&#xD;
AUUST 27th, 1837.&#xD;
Iin case you should visit the cave and find me gone, do not wait my&#xD;
return. Three days since, as my child was walking on the bank of the&#xD;
river at' the point below here, as .has-been her wont of late, she was&#xD;
suadeindy seized by a ruffian; hurried into a boat, and conveyed on&#xD;
board a schooner which was then under weigh, and carried off, before I&#xD;
could, interfere. I. caught a distant view of .the ruffian's face, and I&#xD;
would swearit was that of a wretch whom you may perhaps have met&#xD;
in eO nada-=Oliver Shephard. I hear that Col. Moody is ordered to&#xD;
Malden, and I go thither in search of my lost child. I&#xD;
TIE HERMIT.&#xD;
The face of Benjamin Letts, as he listen d to that terrible letter,&#xD;
was as'pale as marble ;F but he was very calm when he spoke to Stanly,-&#xD;
and informed him that he should start at once, and post through&#xD;
Canada in search of Edith.&#xD;
.MidiIshalstart, too, by the first boat going up Lake Erie, and&#xD;
will meet dyou'in Malden;"osaid- Stanly.&#xD;
"And I'll be off up through the Welland Canal with our little&#xD;
beauty down there, and I'll meet you both somewhere," exclaimed&#xD;
Steve; and the three friends left the cave, to go in search of Edith,&#xD;
each by a different route.      -&#xD;
&#xD;
68&#xD;
&#xD;
N order to explain to the reader's satisfaction the mystery of Edith's&#xD;
bductionfrom the cave,.it will be necessarysto go back a few days, and&#xD;
follow the lawyer, Oliver Shephard, from the hotel in Kingston, at 'the&#xD;
'time he withdrew so suddenly, after the rather abrupt termination of&#xD;
his conversation with the negro, Marcus.&#xD;
As ha passed down the steps, he encountered one of his acquaint-&#xD;
ances who' iad just. arrived from Rochester, who informed him that,&#xD;
in passing down the Genesee in the steamer, he had seen.Edith Letts&#xD;
walking alone near the water, and as she was without shawl or bonnet,&#xD;
it was, but reasoible to suppose that her' residence was' near by,&#xD;
although there were no houses in sight from the steamer's deck, except.&#xD;
three or four old ruins which did not appear .to be inhabited.&#xD;
This, person who gave Shephard the information, had known Edith&#xD;
from her childhood, and it was not at all likely that he could be mistaken&#xD;
in the person.&#xD;
The ever-scheming villian determined to turn this news to his own&#xD;
advantage, and as soon as he"could get rid of his acquaintance, he hur-&#xD;
ried to the quarters of Col. Moody, and, informing him that he had&#xD;
obtained  a clue, which he doubted:not if followed up would lead to the&#xD;
discovery of the mniden's retreat, offered for a certain sum to place&#xD;
Edith once more in the libertine's power.&#xD;
Col. Moody's burning, unholy passion for the hapless girl was'stronger&#xD;
than ever, inasiruich as it was now coupled with the direst hate and&#xD;
deadliest vengeance of which his black heart was capable, against her&#xD;
brother-und now, since that brother's escape from pr-ison and the&#xD;
destruction of the beautiful cottage, this hate and desire for venge-&#xD;
ance was ten times redoubled ;. and he did not hesitate a single instant&#xD;
at the terms proposed, but informed ''Shephard that, provided he was&#xD;
successful, it would be necessary to carry Edith to Malden, a British&#xD;
town and garrison on the Detroit River, near Lake Erie, as he' was&#xD;
himself ordered to that post, and should leave Kingston on the follow-&#xD;
ing day.&#xD;
Shephard, fully satisfied that the intelligence received from his&#xD;
friend was to be relied upon, immediately chartered a small, fast-sailing&#xD;
schooner;owned and commanded .by a vile miscreant named Neal, who&#xD;

made her appearance, and passed within a few feet of where he lay.&#xD;
The moment that her back was towards him, the villain sprang forth&#xD;
from his ambush, caught her ip.inhis arms, ad, in spite of her utnost&#xD;
struggles and frantic screams, be bore her to a boat that was in waiting&#xD;
near at hand, in which she was'coreyed on board the schootier,.which&#xD;
was immediately kept off' down the river before a strong breeze, and&#xD;

days in hopes that the yacht, with some of'Edith's friends would arrive,&#xD;
5his indignation at the outrage, and his love for the poor maniac girl,&#xD;
overcame.all other considerations, and he set out in search of her, on'&#xD;
the very morning before the arrival of her brother, Stanly Morris, and&#xD;
A                  Steve Marvell at the cave.&#xD;
We have heard each one of the three friends express his determina-&#xD;
a                 tion to go at once in search of the lost Edith, and it will be recollected&#xD;
that Steve had made known his intention of taking the yacht through&#xD;
into, Lake Erie, by way of the Welland Canal - and as this was the&#xD;
only route that could be followed by the vessel which had carried off&#xD;
the girl, Steve would be, the most likely one of the three to fall in with&#xD;

which he  was now the commander.&#xD;

him, he determined to stop at Charlotte and ship a couple of inen;. pte.&#xD;

In another hour the little craft was outside the harbor, and= bdawling&#xD;
it off with a fine fresh breeze towards Port 'Dall'ausie.&#xD;
- Before noon, on the -succeeding day, Steve had his vessel in the canal&#xD;
with two horses attached to the towline as a motive power ; an4 when._&#xD;
he reached St. Catharines, some five miles from the 'entrance'of the&#xD;
canal, he left the yacht in- charge of his two sailors,' and 'walked' ip into&#xD;
the town in order to gather, if possible, some information of Shephard,&#xD;
or the vessel he was in search of, as he had little doubt that she must&#xD;
He had passed along a considerable distance through one of the.&#xD;
streets, without yet having met any one of whom he cared to make.&#xD;
inquiry respecting the schooner, when some person suddenly grasped&#xD;
his arm, and 'ono turning his headlie beheld standing beside him ae&#xD;
giant in stature, who, while he retained his grasp in one, hand, pointed&#xD;
with the other to a hand-bill, conspicuously posted on a building=in&#xD;
front of which they were standing, and asked him if he did nob think'&#xD;
the.description of a certain person named therein' as NepdenMart el&#xD;
for whom a reward of two hundred pounds was offered by the goven-&#xD;
ment, would not very well answer for him I&#xD;
Steve saw at a single glance thathe was diseevered--betrayed adJ&#xD;
inan instant his hand was upon his weapon ; but 'before he could drawa&#xD;
his pistol from his bosom, the=stranger made 'a significant 'gesture and&#xD;
spoke a low word of caution iri his'- ear and then drawing him aslie&#xD;
from the public street into a narrow, unfrequented-'alley, he thustads&#xD;
dressed him-&#xD;
'Iff'you are that' bra'e fellow;Stephen'Marvell/ let ne tell you that&#xD;
in the whole world =you have not a 'more devoted friend than myself'&#xD;

qeneto you, to thegod cause we are engaged in, and to others,&#xD;
perhaps whom your garrestmight involve in difficulty."&#xD;
Steve thanked -hisstranger friend for his very timely ea tion and&#xD;
advice ; and with a promise to heed his warning in future, he' took his&#xD;
leave both of him and the village; and followed. on after the, yacht,&#xD;
which hdh this- time got more than ab, mile ahead.-&#xD;
For more than five miles after leaving St Catharines, the Wlland&#xD;
Canal is one constant successionof locks, making the navigation diet.&#xD;
cult, and rendering the passage of, a vessel through, slow and -tedious&#xD;
in the extreme; so that when night eame on, the yacht had still some&#xD;
half dozen of those water-steps to pass, by which vessels climb and&#xD;
descend the mountain which -forma Niagara Falls.&#xD;
Just as they were passing -the last lock, before " tying op" for the,&#xD;
niht, Steve learned from the lock-tender, that at the village-of Tho&#xD;
ra d, not more than half a mile distant, there was a little black schooner &#xD;
which had been lying up.yall.day, while the captain and his crew, together&#xD;
with a gentleman named Shephard, had been searching everywhere, with'&#xD;
twenty of dthe:villagers to assist them, for the daughter of this passen-.&#xD;
ger Shephard, who was deranged, and had somehow managed to escape-&#xD;
frota the-vessel the night previous.&#xD;
Steve'knew in a moment, of course, that. the crazy daughter of the&#xD;
 passenger was none other than Edith Letts.; and totally forgetful of&#xD;
the caution he had received from, or the promise he had made to bia&#xD;
friend at St. Catharines so recently, -he determined to visit the village.&#xD;
and schooner immediately, for the purpose of ascertaining if any tidings&#xD;
had been received of the missing ,girl&#xD;
The canal passes through: the centre of. the village, and as Steve fol-&#xD;
leed ,along the tow-path, he soon discovered the schooner moored&#xD;
alongside the bank, and the idea occurred to him that it would be&#xD;
nite as proper to inquire for Edith on board, as of any one:else;, and&#xD;
a~               a..t was by no means likely that Shephard would be there,-N  'hould&#xD;
I  rw Ics~risk of :being detected himself than h -should by going, fjto&#xD;
one of the public houses of the village. -&#xD;
With this intention, he walked aboard by means of a long 'plank that&#xD;
lay one end on.-the- bank and the,other on the schooner's rail  u&#xD;
g noone         dek ad     e    n being locked, he concluded tha&#xD;
there was:no person on board, adaturvnedi.to:depart.&#xD;

Steve was-.j ndeeided what to. do, but the next- her leaped' to the shored&#xD;
and darted awayalong the towpath like the winud-..n jn the 4dreetilr&#xD;

After passing nearly a dozen vesselslaid up along the bank, Steve&#xD;
t engh espied a large topsail schooner, the appearance of'whieh seemed&#xD;

had he straightened himself out on the lofty yard, when a perfect mob&#xD;
of villagers, led on by the foaming lawyer, and backed:by some twenty&#xD;
sodie  iane yelling on, searching every vessel in their way with the&#xD;
most vigilant care,&#xD;
Atlength the unavailing search was ended, and the disappointed&#xD;
rabble, with the still more 'disappointed lawyer-spy, returned to-the&#xD;
village,, when Steve;:descended. from his perch, and made the captain&#xD;
acquainted with his situation and the particulars of the incident Which&#xD;
had.just occurred&#xD;
The captain, after he had heard Steve's story,-roposed to hi&#xD;
remain on board his vessel until they should getr aro ose to c   to&#xD;

-Steve accepted this very kind offer, and remained concealed in the&#xD;
cabin till the schooner reached the terminus 'of the canal, which was&#xD;
sowet~inieafter dark on the following day, when he had thewsatisfac-&#xD;
tion of seeing the schooner of Shephard leave the harbor, and also of&#xD;
knowing that the villas .had been unsuccessful in his search'for poor&#xD;

THE E1DIPRESS OF  THE !ISLES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
night, ran into a brig beatings out; or 'thebrig ran into the st'atner,;it&#xD;
was never quite;plain which; 'but one thing .was exceedigly plamn&#xD;
whibchwas, that the brig was sunk almost, instantly, the: steamer's&#xD;
gard and wheel-house were}nearly all torn away, five  of her passengers&#xD;
killed outright, and several -others severely injured, among whom was&#xD;
Stanly Morris; who had his left leg and tight arm broken ; and he&#xD;
was other wise so crushed and bruisedthat the guirgeons at Sandusky,&#xD;
whither-he was earried: with the other sufferers, said that, there, was not&#xD;
one chance out of five hundred for him to recover.&#xD;
Doctors, however, like lawyers and other.people, are liable to make&#xD;
sad mistakes sometimes. I throw out this hint; in order that myreaders&#xD;
may not anticipate an event asinevitable, which in realityis' not so,&#xD;
and go into premature mourning for our hero.-&#xD;
I. will anticipate, however, not the events, but-time, and tell you most&#xD;
positively- that Stanly Morris- did -not- die ; ;but'for! two long, weary&#xD;
months, he lay there writhing upon a bed of anguish, hovering upon&#xD;
the very borders of the grave, ipore than half the tite delirious ; raving&#xD;
of his absent, far-off friends, and all the while clinging to life by a grasp&#xD;
so feeble that the slightest mischance might break it, and- launch him&#xD;
into eternity-consign him to an known grave.&#xD;
A constitution naturally robust, aided by the most vigilant care of an&#xD;
attentive nurse and the no mean skill of an accomplished surgeon, at&#xD;
length triumphed as it would seem, almost over death itself, and the&#xD;
invalid began at length slowly to recover.&#xD;
In one of his lucid intervals, soon after-his injuries had been received,&#xD;
Sanly dictated a letter to Katerin which--he made her acquainted with&#xD;
his situation, and begged her to write to him immediately ; but days&#xD;
and weeks went by, until months were counted, and not a single line&#xD;
did 'he;receive to tell hini that he was still remembered.&#xD;
At'last, when nearly three months had expired, and he was able to&#xD;
sit up, and read; 'and, evea walk about for a short time, a letter was&#xD;
brought him one day. The very first look at the missive, brought a&#xD;
fresher,healthier glow to his pale cheek; than had visited it for'many&#xD;
a day. Well it might, for the letter was from his Kate, his betrothed"&#xD;
wife. It was the post-mark of her village ; it was directed in her own&#xD;
beautiful hand-writing.&#xD;
Eagerly he broke the seal, a single glance, -and:then he sank back t&#xD;
his seat, his face, which a moment before was glowing red now as pale&#xD;
as marble. Every feature, nay, his whole'frame, seemed cohvillsed with&#xD;
some terrible agony.&#xD;
But iddenly as if by the exercise of an indomitable, iron will, he'&#xD;
hadistifled every emotion of his heart ; he became won4erfully calm,and&#xD;
commenced reading the 'letter.with as, little appearance of feeling as&#xD;
though it had been but an idle paragraph, in which he had no partica.&#xD;
lar interest.&#xD;
With an author's privilege in such matters, I will invite you to te&#xD;
a peep with me, over the young man's shoulder, and we to - will read&#xD;
the letter.&#xD;
GNo wonder that the cheek of 8tanly M'orris paled,'and his. lip quiv-&#xD;
ered, and a pang of more than mortal agony thrilled his heart  is&#xD;
eyes fell upon'the very first words of that letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
65&#xD;
&#xD;
" Mr. Stanly Morris !" Is it thus you would expect a betrothed&#xD;
wife to commence a letter to one who has once rescued her from a fate&#xD;
ten thousand times worse than death, to one who is almost her hus-&#xD;
band .&#xD;
But let us read :&#xD;
"Ma.StANLY MORRs:---When you left us had th         ve been&#xD;
offered me to resign life forou, I youl have hasw alternatingly&#xD;
-take my life. .How littled Iu kohave answered unhesitatigly&#xD;
loved you, and now I know it was only gratitude. I knrt. ouh ae&#xD;
I now love in reality and that lovas or gantituer on whom yo, heause&#xD;
never seen, nor had I, when you left us.&#xD;
Trusting that this'will find you so far recovered as to be able to&#xD;
respond in person, I shall look for a letter from you, canceling all our&#xD;
engagements to each other.      r   sedmyo,&#xD;
Yours, in friendship,&#xD;
C. JOHNSoN."&#xD;
" Heartless ! I thought she was an angelandsheis -; but I will&#xD;
not censure; it is sufficient that she is false."',u         wl&#xD;
Thus spake Stanly Morris, as he crushed the cold, heartless epistle&#xD;
in his clenched hand.'p&#xD;
We will linger near the almost maddened invalid onl l&#xD;
to hear him renounce the false-hearted girl, and swear never o enough&#xD;
more, and then away on the wings of Arid to the home of the&#xD;
gler, where we shall find---. Why, I have told you somewhere, that&#xD;
Kate had a sister and two brothers ; and now I will tell you that that&#xD;
sister, Harriet Johnson, is the rival of her own sister. She loves Stanly&#xD;
Morris, and is determined to win him. And her brother-one of them&#xD;
-is almost a fool in all but cunning, and in that he is       em&#xD;
satan himself. He has taken a strange dislike to Stanlya ati for&#xD;
partly to torment him, and partly to please his sister Harriet, that he&#xD;
has destroyed the letter written by Stanly without Kate ever having&#xD;
seen it, and wrote the other, which we have read over the invalid's&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
We might have known, and so might Stanly Morris, that Kate-bis&#xD;
ate-never could have written that cruel letter. Poor girl, she was&#xD;
almost frantic-with doubt, fear and despair.  More than three month&#xD;
had gone by, and not one word from the man she loved. Poor Kate I&#xD;

THE TORCH OF WAR-THE SAILOR-sOLDIER-THE ISLAND CAMP-PREPA-&#xD;
RATIONS FOR THE BATTLE.&#xD;
Say, heard ye the notes of dread battle arrayed,&#xD;
Where foemen meet foemnen, and bared is the blade's&#xD;
On the confines of Erie their legions are met,&#xD;
And the war-torch is lighted-0, who shall forget 7&#xD;
I MIGHT go on, writing page after page, telling you all about our&#xD;
hero's mental anguish. his heart-torture, and all the frenzy of his mad-&#xD;
dened brain, which followed the reception of that cold, chilling letter.&#xD;
I might tell you how our heroine, tortured by doubt and uncertainty&#xD;
with regard to-the fate of the man she loved more than life, was driven&#xD;
to the very verge of despair. I might-but no; I should only exhaust&#xD;
my own veracity and imagination, the publisher's limits, and your own&#xD;
patience,,in telling you just what you may find in three-quarters of our&#xD;
modern fashionable novels.&#xD;
As for- opir other characters, scattered as they -are, broad-cast iii the&#xD;
west, it wonld require more time and labor to track them in their&#xD;
leccentric courses, than the limits of our story will warrant ; and for the&#xD;
present I will leave them wherever they are, merely observing that&#xD;
Edith Letts escaped from the ruffian who had her in charge, and found&#xD;
an asylum with the family of an honest old farmer, where she now&#xD;
remains. Shephard is prowling about Detroit, acting as a spy for the&#xD;
colonial government.. Col. Moody is in command of the garrison at&#xD;
Malden. Steve Marvell, having laid up the yacht in Detroit, is search-&#xD;
ing everywhere in the west for some news of his friends ; while Letts&#xD;
and the Hermit are-    we don't know where. But the first we shall&#xD;
meet ere two days more have gone by.&#xD;
More than'three months have mingled their hours and days with the&#xD;
great ocean of the past, since the morning that the three friends sailed&#xD;
in the yacht from French Creek, and with the exception of the foolish&#xD;
brother and rival sister, no one in the village of Clayton had heard&#xD;
anything of the wanderers or the maniac maiden, save some vague&#xD;
reports brought by a disinterested voyager perhaps, of the yacht being&#xD;
laid up in Detroit ; and once or twice something very indefinite was&#xD;
told, of a crazy girl who escaped from a vessel in passing through the&#xD;
Welland Canal.&#xD;
It was the month of December, and old Winter had again wrapped&#xD;
the earth in his snow mantle-again bound the lakes and rivers of the&#xD;
north in his ice-fetters.&#xD;
Many events of a startling nature have occurred within these last&#xD;
three months.&#xD;
In Canada, the low, suppressed whispers of dissatisfaction have&#xD;
swelled into the loud, portentous growls of rebellion.&#xD;
Foremost in the spirit of radical reform, the people of the Gore&#xD;
district have elected their champion--William Lyon McKenzie-to a&#xD;

seat in Parliament. He was immediately expelled from his. seat by a&#xD;
majority of the aristocratic members, and carried back to it in triumph&#xD;
by the people. Again he was driven forth-a strong military force was,&#xD;
posted in the grounds and passages of the capitol, and at the point&#xD;
of the bayonet the members of Parliament enforced their unlawful&#xD;
edict.&#xD;
This last act of high-handed injustice could noI, would not, be borne&#xD;
by people, who had already submitted too long to the tyranny and des-&#xD;
potism of a purse-proud aristocracy. By thousands, they flew to arms&#xD;
from every town and hamlet, and from all the surrounding country&#xD;
they hastened to the capital, and Toronto was besieged.&#xD;
There was a battle ; but British bayonets and soldierly discipline.&#xD;
were more than a match for popular fury, backed as it was by vast odds&#xD;
in point of numbers. The people were routed, a few lives were lost,&#xD;
many prisoners taken, and McKenzie, with many others, were declared&#xD;
traitors.&#xD;
Here I would pause to relate an incident of ferbeious, cold-blooded&#xD;
barbarity, unparalleled in the history of the civilized world.&#xD;
Among the prisoners taken was Col. Lount, an old gray-headed&#xD;
veteran, universally beloved for the many noble qualities of his head&#xD;
and heart.&#xD;
He was tried by a military tribunal, and -sentenced to death as a&#xD;
traitor.&#xD;
It was evening when his almost heart-broken wife, accompanied by&#xD;
her eleven children, sought the Governor General, and in tones of&#xD;
impassioned eloquence, besought, on bnded knee, pardon for a hus&#xD;
band-:-a father.d                            ,       f&#xD;
, The Governor raised the agonized wife from the floor, quieted her&#xD;
fears, and bade her come to him at sunrise on the following morning&#xD;
assuring her that she should have her husband restored to her.&#xD;
The morning came, and with a bland smile upon his face, the'Gov.&#xD;
ernor of Canada-offered his arm to the sobbing wife, to conduct her to&#xD;
her husband.&#xD;
As they reached the prison-yard, the ponderous gate swung back on&#xD;
its hinges, and stepping within the inclosure, the smiling Governor&#xD;
pointed to a frozen corpse swaying to-and fro in the wind, suspended&#xD;
by the neck from a gallows, and very calmly spoke-" There, madam,&#xD;
is your husband ; you can have -him.&#xD;
There was a single moment of silence, and then a wild, long-drawn-&#xD;
out wail of agony, rang out on the morning air, and the next instant&#xD;
the heart-broken woman sank down a corpse at the feet of the smiling,&#xD;
epauletted brute.&#xD;
This was but one of a thousand acts of a similar character perpe-&#xD;
trated during the Canadian reign of terror ; but this was the first , and&#xD;
coupled with the outrage upon the few remaining rights of a suffering&#xD;
people, it was sufficient to fan the long pent-up Ores of discontent into&#xD;
the scathing flames of rebellion.&#xD;
The torch of civil war was lighted, and everywhere in Canada, and&#xD;
along the whole frontier on the American side, thousands were secretly&#xD;
arming for the fray..&#xD;
In all the towns and villages throughout northern Ohio meetings&#xD;

were called, at which inflammatory speeches were made, arms and other&#xD;
plies were voted, Canadian expeditions- planned, and sympathy for the.&#xD;
patriot cause was excited to the highest pitch.-&#xD;
J Sandusky city, a body of Americans; to the number of  more than&#xD;
four hundred, had- assembled, composed mostly of boys, who possessed&#xD;
as little patriotism as they did knowledge of arms ; but they had little&#xD;
else to occupy their leisure hours during the winter, and so they were,&#xD;
anxious to become brigands, and invade Canada-never once reflecting,&#xD;
perhaps, that what was perfectly justifiable on the part of the Cana-&#xD;
dians themselves, would be an act of downright piracy on their part.&#xD;
Stanly Morris, who had entirely recovered from his wounds; was&#xD;
appointed as a captain in this ultra-republican army, and with his&#xD;
brother officers, not one of whom, the commander included, had any&#xD;
more knowledge of military matters than himself, he was busily en-&#xD;
gaged in making preparations for the proposed invasion.&#xD;
On the Canada side of Lake Erie, and separated from the main land&#xD;
by a narrow channel, is a beautiful -island, some five miles in length&#xD;
and two in breadth, called Point as Pelee island, taking its name from&#xD;
a point of land directly opposite on the main. The northeastern end&#xD;
of this island is owned, or was at that-time, by a wealthy old Scotch.&#xD;
man named McCormick, who cultivated a farm of several hundred&#xD;
acres ; but all the southern portion was covered with a dense growth&#xD;
of cedar and juniper. The island was some twenty odd miles distant&#xD;
from Sandusky city, and just about midway between it and Malden,&#xD;
which was the point -designated for the first attack by the self-styled&#xD;
American patriots.&#xD;
Point an Pelee Island was to be the rendezvous where the little&#xD;
Sandusky army were to be joined by a detachment from Michigan,&#xD;
under the bombastic Sutherland and a party of Cleveland vagabonds,&#xD;
led on by the greatest vagabond of them all, the-by some means-Gen.&#xD;
Van Rensselaer.&#xD;
All to the westward of Cleveland, and among the islands from shore&#xD;
to shore, Lake Erie was frozen over so solid that a frigate on wheels or&#xD;
runners might have traversed every part of it without the least chance&#xD;
of once dipping into- her proper element. It was one vast ice-plain,&#xD;
firm as the land itself, and smooth as glass._&#xD;
Stanly Morris did not by any means approve of the unlawful expe-&#xD;
dition in which he was about to engage, neither did he possess a single&#xD;
feeling in common with the wild unquiet spirits by which he was sur-&#xD;
rounded; but he felt that so far as the people of Canada were con-&#xD;
cerned, the cause was a just, a holy one, and if he, by the sacrifice of a&#xD;
life which was now valueless, could aid them in rending asunder the&#xD;
iron bonds which had at length become intolerable, he was ready and&#xD;
willing to do so; and no one of the officers attached to the puerile&#xD;
army of Sandusky patriots, manifested so much zeal in organizing and&#xD;
drilling these embryo heroes, as the young.sailor-soldier.&#xD;
It was the hour of midnight--a cold, dreary, freezing, winter's night.&#xD;
For two whole days had that little army of boys from Sandusky&#xD;
been encamped there on the island of Point an Pelee, impatiently wait-&#xD;
ing for the promised reinforcements. that together they might march&#xD;
upon and attack the British post at Maiden.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ".AINE    11AV   -&#xD;
&#xD;
For two whole days, and two long, cheerless winter nights, had they&#xD;
been encamped there, if camn it could be called, where, without tents,&#xD;
almost without food, and most of them but scantily clad, each indi-&#xD;
vidual sought such shelter as the thick-leaved cedars and the dense&#xD;
growth of juniper afforded, against the sharp, biting frost; and the cold&#xD;
icy north wind.&#xD;
Few and scant were the camp-fires, for the green trunks of those&#xD;
frozen cedars and the slight branches of juniper afforded but indiffer-&#xD;
enf material for such a purpose.&#xD;
And yet, under all these discouraging Circ' stances, there was no&#xD;
word of complaint heard, no signs of discontent manifested, no thought&#xD;
of inglorious retreat, in the heart of a single individual in all that little&#xD;
army of boys.&#xD;
No information had been received from those who ought long since&#xD;
to have joined them, but'the most positive intelligence had been just&#xD;
brought to the island camp that, with the coming dawn, they would be&#xD;
attacked by a force from the British garrison at Malden, of more than&#xD;
four times their own number; and yet no one spoke or thought of&#xD;
flight.&#xD;
As eagerly as if they were preparing for a deer-hunt'or -a shooting&#xD;
. natch, and quite as unconcernedly too, they gathered about their watch-&#xD;
fires, where they plied their busy tasks, casting bullets and preparing&#xD;
their trusty rifles for the coming fight.&#xD;
There is something that shows forth in the American character, under&#xD;
circumstances like this, peculiar to themselves, and which is never to&#xD;
be found in people of any other country under heaven.&#xD;
Brave men are brave everywhere, and all countries produce them.&#xD;
But there is a certain. dogged-(so to speak) contempt for death and&#xD;
danger among Americans, that is never met with elsewhere. It is a&#xD;
species of native recklessness which no other people possess.&#xD;
What other soldiers in the world would have stood there as did&#xD;
those Texan. heroes of the Alamo, battling for the liberty of their coun-&#xD;
try against an enemy twenty' times their number, while one by one&#xD;
they fell, without a thought of surrender or base retreat, until all were&#xD;
slain?&#xD;
Who but Americans would have mined their way from    street to&#xD;
street through solid walls, while the leaden hail fell pattering thick as&#xD;
rain-drops around them, and the crashing cannon balls decimated their&#xD;
ranks at every step, as-did those brave fellows at Monterey ?&#xD;
Who but Americans would have dared,- under the same circum-&#xD;
stances, to land on the island of Cuba, as did that handful of men who&#xD;
composed the last Lopez expedition?&#xD;
And who but Americans would have remained there on Point au&#xD;
Pelee Island that night, situated as they were, and knowing that within&#xD;
ten hours- they would be attacked by a force four times their number ?&#xD;
Nobody. That is my opinion.&#xD;

A WATCFgIRB PICTURE-'A ,STi4NGB CRAFT-ARRI'AL OF SThVn Alt0 ? B&#xD;
BRAVo-THE BATTLE-RETRE4T---TUE BOY ERO.&#xD;
IT is three hours past midnight, and every preparation has been&#xD;
made for the coming fight-at least every preparation that can be&#xD;
made-and all are eagerly waiting for the dawn.. Here and there, you&#xD;
can see shivering groups gathering close about some almost expiring&#xD;
watch-fire, one side of. their bodies scorching in the blaze, whie th9&#xD;
other is pinched with the chill, icy fingers of the frost-king.&#xD;
Again there are some few who, unable longer to bear up against ,the&#xD;
faint, drowsy sensations caused by hunger, fatigue, and want of rest,&#xD;
have crept away into some dense cover of juniper, where, half frozen,&#xD;
they dream in fitful slumbers of far-off friends and home, and a thou,&#xD;
sand comforts which they have, so recently enjoyed, and left for that&#xD;
cold , cheerless, starving island camp..&#xD;
Almost without an exception, these freezing, starving boys, were im-&#xD;
patient for the-dawn and the coming battle.. They felt that anything-.&#xD;
death itself-would be a welcome .relief from all that they then.en&#xD;
dured.&#xD;
'Tis strange that they never once thought of flight. There was a&#xD;
fair, level road of solid ice,-and nothing to obstruct them in their pas-&#xD;
s,age to the American shore ; and yet such a thought never once en-&#xD;
tered the mind of a single individual on the island that night, so far as&#xD;
I could ever learn. They had gone there to fight, and they never once&#xD;
thought of running away.&#xD;
I was there,, and I tell you what I know. 'many there were.on the&#xD;
island that night, who, if they could have been safely at home, would&#xD;
never have left it on such another expedition; but being there, they&#xD;
would die sooner than exhibit one cowardly fear.&#xD;
Perhaps if all could have spoken in one breath, the island camp&#xD;
would have been abandoned; but no one cared to speak first.-&#xD;
By the side of one of the fires, near the shore of the island, is a hand-&#xD;
some young officer, engaged in earnest conversation with a slight boy,&#xD;
apparently not more .than fourteen, who, as he paces back and forth&#xD;
before the fire, you observe is a cripple, caused by one of his legs being&#xD;
considerably shorterthan the other.&#xD;
As we approach the watch-fire, we recognize the young officer as the&#xD;
second in command-Major Hoadley. And the boy, too, we remember&#xD;
him. His name is Charles Gillet ; his father is a farmer in, the inte-_&#xD;
rior of Ohio, and a near neighbor to the young major, whom the boy&#xD;
has followed to Sandusky and thence 'to the island.&#xD;
He is a strange pattern for a soldier, don't you think so,  A dimi:n&#xD;
utive figure, even for a boy of fourteen, with an old wolf-skin cap on&#xD;
his head, and a great, long, old brown coat, with three monstrous capes&#xD;
hanging about him like a Roman toga, and reaching almost to the&#xD;
ground. 0, he is a droll-looking soldier, certainly ; but then that&#xD;
Sandusky army was not composed of such material as that which makes&#xD;
up the New York Scarf Guards.&#xD;

But, hark I the major is speaking very earnestly to the- boy.&#xD;
"No, no,. Charley, I shall never see home again. Whatever the&#xD;
event of to-morrow's battle may be, I have a presentiment.that I shall&#xD;
fall. You know how dearly I love my sister; and now, CharleI&#xD;
want you to swear to me;that if I am killed you will take a purse which&#xD;
you will find in my po lrot py watch, and this ring from my finger, and.&#xD;
give them to Anna, together with my lastblessing. Will you swear,&#xD;
Charlet:&#xD;
" I will. And here, so help me God! I will faithfully erfo  al&#xD;
that you have required of me !"&#xD;
He is a most grotesque figure for a soldier, that crippled bo in the&#xD;
old brown coat, and uncouth wolfskin cap, as he kneels there beside the&#xD;
watch-fire, and with uplifted hands and flashing eyes, swears to execute&#xD;
that. mournful behest.&#xD;
As the..boy continues to kneel there by the fireside, and thema'or&#xD;
stands with bowed head and folded arms, in moody thought the science&#xD;
is suddenly broken by a low, rushingsound, notlike the wind, nor any-&#xD;
thing else to which we can compare it, bat most of anything like a fiL&#xD;
being drawn quickly across the edge of broken glass, only i was tn&#xD;
thousand times louder, and so mightyin volume that the y     e&#xD;
nath our feet quivers with the vibratios.           ground be-&#xD;
The sound comes from in among the islands, away to the southward&#xD;
and westward, and at the first thought we. guess that it is the ic&#xD;
breaking up. And then we know this to be impossible, for it is early&#xD;
in: winter, and the, ice never breaks up atthis season ; besides there is&#xD;
only a gentle breeze blowing from the westward.&#xD;
Each moment the sound grows louder, till within thirty seconds it&#xD;
swells into a wild, discordant, crashing hiss, louder thanthe roar of ten&#xD;
Niagaras;,rahnhislodrtathrorfte&#xD;
1Forth from the cover of the juniper couches spring the half frozen&#xD;
sleepers, up from beside the watch-fires, and out from the dense cedar&#xD;
groves starts many a wondering boy soldier, listening, half in terror, to&#xD;
that strange sound, such as he has never heard before.&#xD;
Another moment, and the first mystery is explained by another more&#xD;
mysterious.&#xD;
Away there in the southwest, towards yonder wooded island  ou&#xD;
can see by the peculiar glare which is reflected back from the ice, even&#xD;
on the darkest night, the dim, shadowy outlines of a spectre craft, each&#xD;
moment becoming plainer and more distant, as she comes rushin on&#xD;
in the direction of the watch-fires, until she at length looms up against&#xD;
the blue sky, a trim, gallant-looking schooner, sailing' noerteie&#xD;
Right on towards the nearest fire comes the phantom vesel wile&#xD;
all stand and gaze upon her in mute fear and wonder.&#xD;
Down, with a crash and a whirr, comes the ice-demon, skirting along&#xD;
the shore till she is abreast of the fire, where stands the handsome&#xD;
}    young major and the cripple boy, when suddenly she rounds to, her&#xD;
sails are taken in, and we behold there in the light of the watch-fire, a&#xD;
huge triangular fabric of strong work, with masts, spars and rigging&#xD;
Sliko a schooner ; and we know that the strange looking thing which we&#xD;
have just seen skimming along over the frozen surface of the lake. is an&#xD;

I it were only "daylight we 'should disenver underneath that massive&#xD;
frame, three immense skates; and it is these -that we have heard making&#xD;
thpt strange, rushing hiss, as they cut. the smooth surface of the ice in&#xD;
theirlightning-like velocity.d&#xD;
Several men step out of the novel craft on to the ice, and as they&#xD;
approach the fAre, we recognize two df them as old acquaintances.-Ben&#xD;
Letts the' Bravo, and Steve Marvell.&#xD;
Stanly Morris leaps. down -on to the ice, and welcome them to- the&#xD;
island, after which Letts-informs the officers, who have gathered about&#xD;
hiii, that more than fourteen hundred troops are on their way to attack&#xD;
them.&#xD;
'He had left Detroit an hour before sundown, and as he passed Mal-&#xD;
den, he'saw: the British just leaving the garrison.&#xD;
Curses and imprecations are heaped upon the braggart Sutherland,&#xD;
as Letts informs the indignant officers that not two hours since he left&#xD;
that office's camp, and offered to bring one hundred and fifty men ;&#xD;
but the coward would not suffer a single man to leave:; and so he had-&#xD;
come down with his dozen volunteers to offer -their aid in the coming&#xD;
struggle.&#xD;
Day dawfed at length, and discovered to the boy warriors a long&#xD;
line of British troops on the ice, and coming up at almost a run, so&#xD;
eager were they for battle.&#xD;
Col. Bradly and the gallant Hoadly marshaled their little army in&#xD;
single file on the ice some three - hundred yards from the island, and&#xD;
after calmly cautioning all not to throw away their fire, they stepped&#xD;
into the ranks, and, armed eachwith his unerring rifle like the rest, they&#xD;
awaited the enemy's approach."&#xD;
On came the British host, confident in their numbers, with waving&#xD;
banners and martial music, while their bright musket-barrels, gleaming&#xD;
bayonets, and the polished brass plates of their belts; flashed back the&#xD;
young sunlight upon the ice-mirror in ten thousand reflections, till their&#xD;
whole front seemed lit up with a blaze of glory.&#xD;
On they come-they are so near that you can almost see them wink,&#xD;
almost hear their labored breathing, when suddenly the little army of&#xD;
boys drop upon one knee, and for an instant only, they squint along the&#xD;
levelled tube ; the next---there is a crash, quickly followed by yells,&#xD;
and dying groans, and screams of mortal agony ; then a few dropping,&#xD;
random shots from the British, and the whole line is thrown into wild&#xD;
confusion.&#xD;
Calmly, as though practising at a target, each one of those striplings,&#xD;
who has just now seen for the first time in his life, a shot fired in anger&#xD;
-loads, upon one knee, fires, and loads again with a rapidity almost&#xD;
past belief, and with an unerring aim that is fast thinning the redtcoated&#xD;
ranks, when suddenly the alarm is raised, and the word runs like wild-&#xD;
fire along the patriot line, that a squadron of dragoons are on the ice,&#xD;
and coning down like a whirlwind to out-flank them, and cut off their&#xD;
retreat.&#xD;
Their ammunition too, was almost exhausted, and the patriot com-&#xD;
mander reluctantly gave the word to retire from the ice, and take&#xD;
shelter on the island where the dragoons could not act.&#xD;
The order was misunderstood, and a retreat commenced which almost&#xD;

dragoons were cutting and slashing, and riding -down the fugitives&#xD;
while the foot soldiers-went on shooting and stabbing, and nmurdering&#xD;
all who fell into their hands.&#xD;
Letts and Steve, together with some thirty others; gained the iear&#xD;
boat, which was got under weigh ; - and well might she have' been called&#xD;
an ice-fiend that morning; for under- the guidance of-the infuriated&#xD;
Bravo, she was steered crashing in though theBritish ranks now here:&#xD;

course.  --&#xD;
Stanly was n4 where to be seen, and when at. length the battle was&#xD;
totally lost, Letts bore away with his ice-craft forSandusky city.t&#xD;
When the word came to retire from the -ice, the cripple boy wa=&#xD;
standing beside his commander, Major Hoadly, who, 'as ho -tned&#xD;
towards the boy, received a musket-ball in the temple, and fell dead&#xD;
without a word or a groan,&#xD;
In an instant, Charley, faithful to his promise, was kneeling beside&#xD;
him.. He had secured the watch and purse, when he caught sight of a&#xD;
giant British soldier within thirty steps, running at him with leveled&#xD;
bayonet. In an instant the boy caught up the major'srifle, which he&#xD;
had finished loading at the moment that- he fell,.and taking deliberate&#xD;
aim, he shot- the soldier through the head, after which he drew the&#xD;
dead officer's ring from his finger, and amid a shower of bullets, he fled&#xD;
towards the ice-boat, which he gained just as she got under weigh and&#xD;
{ -   so finally escaped with only seven bullet-holes. through his old browii&#xD;
coat, and one through his wolf-skin cap, so close that it grazed his&#xD;

DERED DURFEE--BRITISfl OUTRAGE- AND THE BRA    vow.&#xD;
ALMOST in the centre of foaming Niagara, and some three miles&#xD;
above the eternal cataract, is situated a long, narrow island, having a&#xD;
few ordinary looking farm houses scattered along its shores, bat covered&#xD;
principally with a dense growth of dwarfish trees, with here and the&#xD;
a solitary old oak, towering aloft above the surrounding thickets like&#xD;
some tall giant amid-a group of school-boys&#xD;
This is Navy Island ; and here it was that one of the most ridiculous&#xD;
farces which was enacted during the whole two years' history of Cana-&#xD;
dian Rebellion, occurred.&#xD;
Some seven hundred men and, boys, representing every grade of&#xD;
American society but the respectable,-were- assembled under the Pur-&#xD;
pose of-.--.ah!I that is a mystery.  Probably not one. of that mis-&#xD;
named patriot host knew why they were there, and it is equally'&#xD;
probable that very few of them cared. But each individual seemed to&#xD;
know he had heretofore, all his life time, been a cypher in community,&#xD;

The officers of this modern winter' crusade, it may be, were man of&#xD;

although it is doubtful that any of them knew of any ultimate design,&#xD;
other than -thy were to assemble thee on the island, and wait the&#xD;
action of their eo-patriotsin Canada.&#xD;
With some three or four old' and nearly unserviceable pieces of artil-&#xD;
-lery, perhaps a rifle, ors a- condemned United States- musket to every&#xD;
third, man, no camp equipage, very little- ammunition, less provisions, in&#xD;
the midst of the rigorous frontier winter, with the snow full two feet&#xD;
deep, and -the men-if-possible worse clad than even the-heroes of Point&#xD;
au Pelee, it was altogether one of the maddest schemes ever thought of;&#xD;
apd any, one who may chance to be thoroughly posted up in the&#xD;
history of the Navy Island affair, need not be in the least surprised if&#xD;
at soine future time' he should be informed that a dozen porter-house&#xD;
desperadoes, led on by a rum-bloated Van Somebody, should seize upon&#xD;
a- canal boat, cross the' Atlantic, blockade the English Channel, and ,&#xD;
pssess themselves of the Isle of Wight, from whioh to invade Great&#xD;
Britain!&#xD;
Several days had gone by since the occupation of the island, during&#xD;
which time the " crusaders" had been starving, freezing, wading about&#xD;
in the snow, and keeping up a desultory firing from their few rusty,&#xD;
inufficientrguns upon the town of Chippewa and two or three farm.&#xD;
houses along the bank of the river, most of their shot, however, drop.&#xD;
ping harmlessly into the river, far short of the object aimed at, when,&#xD;
oie=cold, blustering afternoon, a little steamer from Buffalo landed at&#xD;
the island, having on board some forty passengers, mostly men of re-'&#xD;
spectability, who had chartered the boat and come down merely to have&#xD;
a look at the chrysalis Napoleons of Navy Island.&#xD;
It was almost sundown when-the passengers were ready to embark,&#xD;
and as the river was running full of ice, making the night navigation&#xD;
up stream both dificult and dangerous, it was ecided to run the&#xD;
steamer over to a little wharf at Selocsher, about a mile above the falls,&#xD;
oi thie American side, and there remain till morning.&#xD;
Just at dark the steamer was secured to the wharf, and as several of&#xD;
her passengers were anxious to return' to Buffalo that. night, they pro-&#xD;
cured two teams and set out immediately.&#xD;
Still there were more persons on board than could be accommodated&#xD;
with berths. and so another party repaired to a hotel which was only&#xD;
a few rods from the wharf. leaving on board the steamer, as nearly as&#xD;
ever -could be ascertained, sixteen persons exclusive of the crew.&#xD;
It was 'an hour past midnight, when the inmates of the hotel were&#xD;
suddenly aroused from slumber -by the quick discharge of fire-arms,&#xD;
accompanied by the screams and yells of men being shot and stabbed&#xD;
to death.&#xD;
''lying to the doors .and windows, and some of them out into the&#xD;
street, they beheld a scene which, chilled their very hearts' blood, and&#xD;
struck them with mute horror.'&#xD;
There,, on board the steamer, not ten rods distant, they beheld the,&#xD;
bright, red flames darting upwards in at dozen 'plaees, illuminating and-&#xD;

Everywhere amid the flames gleamed' t! s'a'!  form of 'the$&#xD;
unman demons, as, led on by more demoniac c ecrs, they reveled  n&#xD;
their bloody midnight massacre.&#xD;
-One only (as far as was ever known) of all that little company&#xD;
escaped to the shore: He sought to escape assassination by stealing&#xD;
along in the shadow of an old warehouse, and had almost  fined the&#xD;
edge of the wharf, when he was discovered, shot-don and riddled with&#xD;
bullets ; but still he lived and :essayed to drag himself away upon. his&#xD;
hands and knees. "Kill the Yankee rascal " shouted the valorous&#xD;
English commander, and a dozen soldiers sprang forward to 'eredute&#xD;
the brutal order.&#xD;
In vain poor Durfee implored mercy at the hands of these internal&#xD;
scarlet' butchers. They were ifed to murder--.it= ias their trade.&#xD;
" Mercy ! mercy ! mer--"&#xD;
lit the last cry was hushed by a dozen bayonets, already dyed crirn,.&#xD;
ion with human gore, that went crushing and grating through the&#xD;
victim's body.&#xD;
For a moment the wretched man remained there upon his hands and&#xD;
knees after the reeking steel was withdrawn, and then, with a terrific&#xD;
scream, leaped high into the air, and fell upon.his back in his'last death&#xD;
ogonies.&#xD;
A British soldier more merciful-or it may be, more cruel-.-than&#xD;
his companions, turned the butt of his musket and ended the sufferings&#xD;
of the miserable victim by dashing out his brains.&#xD;
If there was ever a murder; a most damnable cold-blooded assassina-&#xD;
lion on earth, it was that of poor Durfee--shot, stabbed, and his braiie&#xD;
beaten out by British soldiers, by command of British officers, there 'on&#xD;
the American soil. That such an outrage should have been suffered to&#xD;
go iznatoned for, is a foul stain. upon the bright escutcheon of iod&#xD;
national shield.&#xD;
Had such an outrage been perpetrated upon British ground, and&#xD;
upoika British subjeet;and sanctioned by the government of those who&#xD;
committed it, a hundred thousand British bayonets Would have avenged&#xD;
the cold-blooded murder.&#xD;
But among all the nations of the earth, our own has been the most&#xD;
backward in seeking redress for individual wrongs inflicted upon hef&#xD;
children.&#xD;
'Tis true 'she is very particular-with regard 'to her national honor;&#xD;
but it seemed to be a settled' policy with the government of the United&#xD;
States, to "let the. boys take care of themselves -' if they get into 'diffi&#xD;
eulty, let them get out again; if insulted, let' em'bear it ; if robbed&#xD;
and plundered, keep quiet and try it again ; if mnurdered-- why, it's&#xD;
not much.consequence-plenty more men in the Country.&#xD;
The burning steamer 'was cast 'adrift, and .as she' was whirled along&#xD;
down the seething current towards the' mighty cataract, soine five 'o'&#xD;

which now almost wholly enveloped, the deck in a fiery mantle, while&#xD;
their wild, agonized screams went up to .heaven, and rang out on the&#xD;
frpsty night-air loud and shrill. above the thunder tones of the falls.&#xD;
With cheers and loud hurrafs, the.British butchers returned to their&#xD;
boats,-and pulled for-the Canada shore, while the blazing steamer, with&#xD;
heir ereaming passengers roasting to death in those raging flames, went&#xD;
whirling on' down the hissing torrent fora. few inoments longer, until&#xD;
1}e brink of the vast cataract was gained, when, simultaneously with,&#xD;

gone with her cargo of murdered dead andthe few who survived the&#xD;
massacre, down into the abss of wild, foaming waters.&#xD;
such was the fate of tie steamer Caroline, and a portion--no one&#xD;
utu God will everiknow bow many-of her passengers.&#xD;
Scarcely had the British boats disappeared in the gloom-scarcely&#xD;
Iiad that darkness settled down upon the. scene, as the burning boat&#xD;
plunged down the lgid precipice-when two horsemen came thunder-&#xD;
ing along the road from the direction of Buffalo,.who flung themselves&#xD;
from their panting horses, as they, drew rein near the group from Ahe&#xD;
tavern, nowgathered about the'body of the murdered Durfee.&#xD;

way through the little crowd, aud the bright glare of a lantern which&#xD;
one of the ,men holds in his hand falls upon his face, you recognize him&#xD;
i , afmomenlt.&#xD;
It is the escaped convict-Ben Letts, the Lake Bravo.&#xD;
His companion is the brave, faithful fellow, Steve Marvell.&#xD;
"Poor Darfee !" exclaims the Bravo, as his eyes fell upon the ale,&#xD;
distorted features of the young man; "poor Durfee ! your's has indeed&#xD;
been a most .untimely fate;, blessed with .a wife. almost an angel, two&#xD;
sweet blooming children, health, and a comfortable home, and all, every-&#xD;
thing worth living for, and now-- Gentlemen"-her speaks, to those&#xD;
about him, interrupting himself--" gentlemen, could you have seen that&#xD;
inn who now lies there a corpse-could you only have seen him as I&#xD;
did but yesterday, when he imprinted the last kiss upon the lips of his&#xD;
lovely wife, when he held his dear children- to his fond heart for the&#xD;
last tinie-ah ! could you have seen all this, your very hearts would&#xD;
)ced for the bereaved ones who are now eargerly awaiting his return.&#xD;
His wife is the sister of my friend here, she importuned us to hasten&#xD;
hither and urge him to return by land; we procured horses and have&#xD;
ridden at our best speed ; but poor Myra, all too late to avert the sad&#xD;
fate of your loved husband."     ..&#xD;
There is a few momcnto' pause, during which the Bravo stands gazing&#xD;
alternately from the dead man to Steve, and the latter upon .the body&#xD;
of his murdered brother-in-law. -&#xD;
Then suddenly the Bravo grasps his friend by the arm, and together&#xD;
they kneel there in the crimsoned snow, beside the stiffening corpse,&#xD;
while Letts, placing, one, hand upon the pulseless heart of the dead,&#xD;
raises the other towards Heave, and in a voice and tone that causes&#xD;
all to tremble, he swears to wreak a most terrible vengeance upon the&#xD;
commander of those British murderers.  We shall see how well he s&#xD;
redeemed his oath.&#xD;

little island where Linda, the recluse drew her last breath, and where&#xD;
her lone grave is made.&#xD;
Eleven months, and it is the last of'April, 1838,&#xD;
Many exciting scenes have been- enacted in Canada and along the&#xD;
frontier, during the eleven months that have passed.&#xD;
Our characters have all been busy, but how and where, it is of little&#xD;
importance to us and the world generally to know, just now.&#xD;
Will say, however, that I have heard nothing of the Hermit since&#xD;
his own letter was read in the cave.- Of Stanly Norris I never have&#xD;
heard a lisp since the morning of- that fight at Point au Pelee. The-&#xD;
Bravo and hir friend Steve have remained quiet since we -saw -themr&#xD;
early in the winter beside the murdered Durfee.. Edith Lett has been&#xD;
lost ever since she escaped from the schooner last summer; and as for&#xD;
the libertine Colonel and his vile associate Oliver Shephard, they are&#xD;
out of the way somewhere, and were it not that I shall be obliged to use:&#xD;
them,.out of the world altogether.&#xD;
So you see I have managed to lose all my--no, not my-our charac-,&#xD;
ters, except two: old Bill and his daughter Kate. Rather a queer&#xD;
state of things, you will-say,for a writer of romance to lose all his mate-&#xD;
rial before he is half through his story. - I acknowledge it is, but then&#xD;
I am not to blame-.-I could'nt help it; and' were it not that one of tha&#xD;
two remaining characters is the principal one--the future Emlnpreass-.&#xD;
she after whom I have christened'my story-I should he sorely tempted&#xD;
to loseher, and her father with the rest ; making. a losing story of it&#xD;
entirely, and wind it up right here, Perhaps it would be as wellafer&#xD;
all, as-to follow them along through another year, and then-kill half of'&#xD;
them myself. But circumstances are imperious; many of the Bravo's&#xD;
desperate acts' must be told. The villain Shephard must meet. the&#xD;
reward of his many crimes ; Col. Moody of his infamous libertinism;&#xD;
the mystery of Stanly Morris' birth, or rather of his parentage, must&#xD;
= be explained, The veil must be-rent from the Hermit of=the  enese".&#xD;
and Kate must be an Empress..- So, on the whole, I. think best to g"o n.&#xD;
Well, it is, you will recollect, Spring again, a most beautiful da  i.&#xD;
the last week of April, and we;are at our favorite spot, Linda's Island..&#xD;
It is not what it was when -we visited it last;- in appearance, &#xD;
mean.. The trees are as green, the grass and powers, and l1, as bright&#xD;
and ful of Nature's loveliness as ever ; the little lakelet is as placid,&#xD;
ai  the solitary grave there under! the old willow is as lonely'as ever;&#xD;
but for all that, Linda's Island is very much changed since we were&#xD;
here last!&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7541-00000040"/>&#xD;
THE EMPRESS OF TE ISLESI Ot,&#xD;
Near the margin of the lakelet, on the opposite side from the grave,&#xD;
is a beautiful white cottage finished in .4he very best style of modern&#xD;
architecture ; and then you see there is a substantial but elegant fence,&#xD;
white-al rseo, lesng some two seres 'of ground already-planted wih&#xD;
fruit and ornamental trees ; while a portion next the cottage is sepa-&#xD;
rated from the other by a slight trellis work, and this part is beautifully&#xD;
arranged as a parterre, in which we can -discover almost every variety&#xD;
offowers usually found -in our northern climate, and so arranged that&#xD;
they speak to you in mute but eloquent language, of a kind gardiar&#xD;
auuel that-. But hark t A fernale voice, and singing, too, a simple,&#xD;
toeahin ballad, which we have heard hundreds of times; but oh, hoer&#xD;
sweetly it sounds,-we have never heard it sung thus before.&#xD;
But look there !--there, at the open window in the eastern wing of&#xD;
the cottage-that which commaidi the best view of the parterre.  .&#xD;
Burns' 'Highland Mary." Exquisite little song, and most .exqui.&#xD;
sitely is it warbled, in a voice so full of Nature's melody, that even the&#xD;
birds whiehl fit here and there, about this sylvan home, seem nore.&#xD;
joyous, inspired by those gushing notes, and warble bak their own, in&#xD;
glad response.&#xD;
We more "than half guess the author of' those sad -plaintive;-tones,&#xD;
from a single glance at the profusion of black shining curls which we see(&#xD;
falling down, and almost entirely hiding the features of the singer, as&#xD;
seated at the low, open window, with her head reclining upon her had,&#xD;
she pours forth her whole soul in song.&#xD;
Yes, we are right ; for as she ceases to sing, she sits more erect, and&#xD;
tosses back the envious rrls fromnlierifair velvet-oheek, revealing, as she&#xD;
does so, the classic and most superbly beautiful creature whom we first&#xD;
saw navigating the little lakelet in her fairy skiff-Kate Johnson,.our&#xD;
heroine, and future " Empress of the Isles.&#xD;
- You observe that deep shade of sadness which seems to have-made&#xD;
its home there, on those sweet, child-like features, and 'you know that&#xD;
she is'far from being happy; yet she is beautiful, quite as beautiful as&#xD;
when we -first saw her.&#xD;
Your attention for a moment, 'and I will tell you something of her&#xD;
sorrow before we enter the cottage.&#xD;
You will recollect her sister's love for 'Stanly, and her foolish&#xD;
brother's treacherous act in suppressing that letter from $tenly, and&#xD;
writing the reply which we read over the young man's shoulder there&#xD;
at-iSanduaky.y&#xD;
;Now Kate never once dreamed of these things, and week after week&#xD;
abouth aftermouth,'had she grieved, sorrowed and wondered 'why Stanly:&#xD;
Oid-not return,.or write at least- .Poor girl ; little did she dream-that&#xD;
Stanly Moi,be'lieving 'her faithless, had sworn in his heart never to&#xD;
see 'hr again'; add so she.continued to dream on and  ait-for his 'com&#xD;
ingg and all thie time her beautiful cottage was beinbilt on teislne&#xD;
abd,'where she spent a great part of the time during the. fine, pleasant&#xD;
weher-of -the fall,-in -costructing-her  wer-bed,'planting trees; ,nt&#xD;
aesanging the 'grounds,:at the same time that she superintended the'&#xD;
interior fitting' up dfathescottage, in accordance with'tie erpress wish&#xD;

gwiter setin; Kate would- often pass.over the ; island on ,the ice, and&#xD;
spend a whole week alone in the cottage, which had been furnished&#xD;
throughout by the-orders of Mt. Andrews,-and. under the supervision&#xD;
Qf,Kate herself.&#xD;
Thus passed- the tedious days and weeks; and all the while Kate&#xD;
was-very unhappy, for at times she was almost certain that Staalywass&#xD;
dead. But she was destined to be more unhappy still; for one day in&#xD;
early sprwg, when the snow was gone and the first powers bea to&#xD;
peep forth again, Harriet was taken alarmingly ill. Fearing that she&#xD;
ras about to die, the infatuated girlcalled Kate to her bed-side,  d&#xD;
revealed lher- duplicity,, her love for Sany- an  hermenswhchsh&#xD;
.iad employed to bring about an estrangement between the lovers,hn fool&#xD;
ishly hoping that she might one day win Stanly Morris for herself&#xD;
Kate -could not withhold her forgiveness to her Penitent and perhaps&#xD;
dying sister; but all-her respect and confidence nfortaonce loved sister&#xD;
had now 'fled forever, and poor Kate was unhappy indeed.&#xD;
Harriet, however recovered; and Kate, being no longer aprehensiv&#xD;
on her sister's account, absented herself from hoe andr   ees&#xD;
has remained here -almost constantly, tending her flowers, singing those&#xD;
sweet songs, and watching for the return of Stanly Morris, whom she&#xD;
has never once doubted and even now, ignorant as she is of his 'fate,&#xD;
she knows that if he is alive, she will see him again-he will return,&#xD;
and they shall yet be very happy. Such is woman's faith.e  t&#xD;
Our delay has lost us the opportunity of visiting the interior of the&#xD;
cottage ; for something down by the lakelet has attracted the girl's&#xD;
notice; and in a moment, she bounds away, along down towards a little&#xD;
gate -that opens out of the grounds on the tide nextowillow-it&#xD;
shore of the lakelet.&#xD;
Indistinctly.,through the leafy screen of willows, we can see the forni&#xD;
of a skiff, the dim outlines of a human form, and then, ust as the 'ir&#xD;
reaches the gate, a man steps forth dressed in the arof a   r&#xD;

"Well I don't see why you should, Miss Kate ; for I'm sure Stanly&#xD;
Morris is worthy of all your love. But I've got something to tell you&#xD;
about sm. About a month since I got a letter written by him in&#xD;
Detroit, in which he says that he was taken prisoner at Point an Pelee,&#xD;
but managed to escape before he was taken to Malden. He also says&#xD;
that he shall go up into Lake Superior, where he intends to pass the&#xD;
summer. Next fall, le will come here to visit his mother's grave, and&#xD;
then, he-says, he shall bid farewell. to his little island forever. I didn t&#xD;
believe a word ofit, Miss Kate; and I don't now-; and I tell you what&#xD;
I'll do---if you'll just give me a roving commission to sail under your&#xD;
flag, I'll be off after Captain Stanly to-morrow, and if I don't bring&#xD;
him in here as a prize, in lei than three months, you may say Steve&#xD;
marvel s a marine. This is what I've come down to tell you, and not&#xD;
finding you over home, on my bringing up there, I got a skiff and pulled&#xD;
over here."&#xD;
.e0, thank you, Steve; but come with me over home, and stay to-&#xD;
night ; I wsh to write a letter ; and to-morrow---s&#xD;
"I'll beaoff for Lake Superior." And ten minutes after, two skiffs&#xD;
left the island for- the Smuggler's home at: French Creek.&#xD;

Mackinw,'wherei ahe said that he had heard of Stanly at the Sault&#xD;

That part of the Canadian 'frontier bordering on the Detroit river,&#xD;
from its near proximity to the United States, and the facilities for&#xD;
crossing to be found along the American =sides, was peculiarly exposed&#xD;
and had-been, during the past winter and spring; onstantly in a state&#xD;
of alarm.&#xD;
Col. Moody, who, it will: berecollected, was in command of 'the&#xD;
prison at Malden and the senior commander on ,the Detioit frontier, as'&#xD;
kept constantly on the alert, and 'found but small leisure for the exer-&#xD;
cise of his libertine propensities ; but as the summer wore away and'&#xD;
matters became quiet,' he found leisure to plan and execute new&#xD;
schemes in his own peculiar line of viliany.&#xD;
Notwithstanding two or three rather brilliant conquests which ho'&#xD;
lad made in the neighborhood of Malden, he was far from being satis-&#xD;
fied till he had; the unfortunate Edith once more in his power. He&#xD;
lad7 heard nothing from her since her escape from Shephard; -but 'h&#xD;
somehow fancied that she must be still in the vicinity of Thorald, and&#xD;
determined, if husan agency could compass it, to regain possession of&#xD;
her person.                      Cmas,         gi    ossino&#xD;
With this view he had despatched a trusty messenger to the Niagara&#xD;
district, who had his instructions to make the most diligent inquiries&#xD;
fur miles i every direction fromn'the place whence she escaped.&#xD;
Unfortunately Shephard, his associate in crime, had been absent in&#xD;
Montreal and towns along the St. Lawrence for over three months, o'&#xD;
he would have entrusted the matter altogether to-him.&#xD;
One evening, near sunset, the Colonel was walking in a little garden.&#xD;
of a few rods in extent, in the rear of his quarters, when he was sud-a&#xD;
deny startled by some person- leaping the low board fence which sur-&#xD;
rounded the garden, and the next moment the -ver man of whom he&#xD;
had been thinking for the last half hour--Oliver Shephard, the gov-&#xD;
emnent spy--stood, before himi.&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
more than four ? since the noble sailor left in search 'of her- beloved&#xD;
busband-almost a year since he held Iher to his beating heart in a last;&#xD;
fervent embrace, and swore to love her during life. Still he came not.&#xD;
"He will never come !'' she would often exclaim, in her despair.&#xD;
Poor Kate! her's was a nature that could love, and live on in&#xD;
anguish, with, the bloom upon her cheek, and the bright sparkle in&#xD;
her eye, giving 'the lie to the canker that was eating at her young&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Others would' have faded away, and sunk into the grave ; but her's&#xD;
was a heart of sterner, though none the less womanly material. She&#xD;
loved, Stanly Morris as few women have ever loved-as few cam love-&#xD;
butH  he would not let evendespair crush her.&#xD;
Had she known him to beunworthy of her love, she might have dis-&#xD;
carded him, and then died, perhaps ; but ' she knew hinm to be worthy&#xD;
of her heart's best, holiet affections, and that' very knoledge was an&#xD;
armor of proof against even suspense. And so she continued to hope;&#xD;
alt iotigh hope grew faint,, and suspense was torture.&#xD;
Ifis- the-month of August, -838, and for the present let us leave the&#xD;
Island home, the borrowing, hoping.and almost despairing heroine, and&#xD;
the wandering hero with the faithful sailor- still on his track.,&#xD;

&#xD;
"Think of satan, and he is with you," exclaimed Col. Moody, sur-&#xD;
prised at the unexpected appearance of the man whom he had supposed&#xD;
to be several hundred miles distant.&#xD;
" In that case, Col. Moody, you and I must needs keep his satanic&#xD;
majesty dancing attendance upon ourselves almost constantly," replied&#xD;
the lawyer, apparently somewhat nettled at the officer's remark.&#xD;
"It was only a very common saying that I made use of, my friend-&#xD;
nothing personal, I assure you," said Col. Moody, advancing a step and&#xD;
' rasping Shephard'is hand, which he shook as though he was delighted&#xD;
to see him ; and no doubt he was.&#xD;
"I have been wishing you here these three weeks past," continued&#xD;
the Colonel, "and for the past twenty-four hours I have been thinking&#xD;
of you'nearly every moment."   I&#xD;
" Something you wish me to do 7" inquired the lawyer, laconically.&#xD;
"Yes, a service which I would rather entrust to you than any other&#xD;
person."                                 -       /&#xD;
" I will hear it, and then, if it be possible and fairl   paid for,.I will&#xD;
perform it. But first,.Col. Moody, I have a piece of information to&#xD;
communicate, in which, if I mistake not, you feel interested."&#xD;
" What is it P' inquired the officer, eagerly, "has that escaped con-&#xD;
vict--"              -.&#xD;
" I know nothing about him," said Shephard, quickly interrupting&#xD;
the Colone. " It is more than fourmonths since I heard from Ben.&#xD;
Letts. Its }s of his sister, Edith,. that- --.--"&#xD;
"What!" broke in the impatient libertine, " have you seen her ? can&#xD;
you-   "&#xD;
." Fair and softly, Col. Moody. , One question at si time. But it is&#xD;
better, perhaps, that I tell my story without any questions at all."  '&#xD;
" Well, go on, I will not interrupt you again," said the 1British&#xD;
officer, assuming an air of calmness which be was very far from feeling.&#xD;
" Very well, theu," commenced Shephard; "a few days since I was&#xD;
passing along the road leading from St. Catharines to Chippeway, when,&#xD;
about, fiva miles from the latter place, I observed a female in a little&#xD;
rustic garden near a comfortable-looking farmhouse, whom I r ognized&#xD;
in s moment as Edith Letts. She was'busily engaged with some rose-&#xD;
bushes, and did not observe me.; and not deeming it prudent to make&#xD;
myself known, I drove, on to the next house, only a few rods distant,&#xD;
where, as it happened to be a kind of an inn, I had an excellent excuse-&#xD;
for stopping, under the pretence of procuring breakfast for myself and&#xD;
refreshment ,for my horses.&#xD;
" From the landlady, who was a real gossip, I soon learned that her&#xD;
neighbor, an honest, kind-hearted old Scotchman, had found the girl,&#xD;
carly one morning, as he was returning home from Thorald. All they&#xD;
knew of her was that she was very beautiful--that her name was Edith,&#xD;
and that she was not altogether ' right in her head,' as the woman ex-&#xD;
pressed it. But everybody loved her, and the old farmer, as well as&#xD;
his. wife, had learned to consider her as their own child. -&#xD;
"Having obtained the information I sought, I continued my journey;&#xD;
and now, perhaps, if you still wish to--"&#xD;
" I do !" exclaimed Col. Moody, his impatience getting the better of&#xD;
his discretion. "I understand you, Shephard. You would say that&#xD;
&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
if I still wish to get Edith Letts into my power, you can assist me. I&#xD;
tes- you I do. It is, and has been, the first wish ofmy heart ever&#xD;
since I have had leisure to think.  My passion for that girl is ten&#xD;
times more fierce than ever, and 0!1 how often I have wished that you&#xD;
were here, that Imight have your aid..&#xD;
- My aid is ever at your service when it is required and paid for,'&#xD;
Col. Moody ; but before we enter into any new arrangement, it will be&#xD;
quite proper to adjust a small matter which has remained unsettled&#xD;
longer than I usually permit my accounts to run."&#xD;
" What do you mean, sir ?" inquiired the Colonel, in astonishment.&#xD;
"Only this, Colonel. Last summer you' employed me to escort Miss&#xD;
Letts from Genesee river to this place, and----"&#xD;
You failed to do so by permitting her to escape ; and viow whatdo&#xD;
you-expect ?"&#xD;
"IThat yea will pay me&#xD;
"FPor what ?"&#xD;
' For the failure, if you will, Col. Moody. I paid out more than a&#xD;
hundred pounds to the captain of the schooner and his crew; besides&#xD;
my own expenses."&#xD;
" And this you expect to refund?"&#xD;
"Ay, and the moderate sum of one thousand pounds with it."&#xD;
-"Never i"&#xD;
" Very well, Colonel, then you'will dispense with my services in the&#xD;
matter of bringing the girl hither."&#xD;
"Be it so, then, Oliver Sbhephard. Luckily, your services are not&#xD;
indispensable, for, permit me to inform you, I have already a trusty&#xD;
agent employed on the very mission in question; and, with the in-&#xD;
formation which you have just :imparted to me, and which I shall&#xD;
immediately transmit to him, it will be strange indeed if he does not&#xD;
sueeed in securing the prize without any aid from you."&#xD;
"Most ably argued Colonel," replied the lawyer, with a sardonic&#xD;
smile; "but perhaps a glance at these documents, of which you have&#xD;
already had from me very fair copies, will convince you that it is for&#xD;
your interest to pay the very trifling demand. You see these are the&#xD;
gnuie articles, sir-seals, signatures, and all. You would doubtless&#xD;
have discovered your mistake at the time you received the copies, had&#xD;
you not been so prompt in destroying them."&#xD;
"For several moments the Colonel stood there, with quivering lip&#xD;
and flashing eye, and cheeks as pale as death, speechless with rage,&#xD;
fear, and astonishment ; but at length, partially mastering his emotion;&#xD;
he replied-&#xD;
" Oliver She hard, I will submit no longer to your infamous extor-&#xD;
tions. Go publish those papers to the world; one of them, or the&#xD;
event it certifies, is. no secret in Canada, and the other none in Eng-&#xD;
land ; then do your worst-I defy' you. Better suffer a 'trifle from&#xD;
public opinion than buy your silent and friendship at the price you&#xD;
set Upon it."&#xD;
Nevertheless, you will purchase these commissions, and at my price,&#xD;
too."&#xD;
" No, by Heaven   I will not,"&#xD;
" Colonel Moody, have you ever reflected upon the subject of death I&#xD;

Now, as a soldier, you would doubtless prefer ;to die as a hero, ,uppQ the&#xD;
:fielddof glory;; but have you ever happened to remember what a dis-&#xD;
grace it would be to your fauiily, and how very unpleasant to yourself,&#xD;
to he strangled by. the public hapgman ?"&#xD;
"In'the fiend's name, what mean-you?" gasped the trembling officer,&#xD;
while his knees smote against each other-his hands clenched convul-&#xD;
ively, tillthe nails dug into the palms, and his eyes seemed bursting&#xD;
from their sockets.&#xD;
" And in the fiend's name I answer you, sir Colonel," replied the&#xD;
sniooth-faced, imperturbable lawyer?&#xD;
" Some eighteen months since a young lady in Kingston, named&#xD;
Effie Seward, (at the mention of that name the Colonel started as&#xD;
though bitten by an adder ; but. the lawyer went on,) of respectable&#xD;
connexions, was found one morning floating.in the bay near the King's&#xD;
bridge. The coroner's jury rendered a verdict of accidental drown-&#xD;
ing ; but there were two persons who stood in the dark shadow of&#xD;
the bridge one, night,-andsaw1a British officer plunge a female form&#xD;
down into the water,w ho were not sworn at that inquest. Don't you&#xD;
think, Colonel, that their testimony would have placed the affair in&#xD;
rather a different light, and a certain gallant officer in the Royal Rifles&#xD;
in a somewhat unpleasant position ?"&#xD;
If he had expected an answer to these startling questions, he had it&#xD;
iJ tlge distorted. features and. trembling frame.of his companion.&#xD;
l4or five long minutes, the agony of the guilty Colonel -*as most&#xD;
lqrrible ; his face was pale as that of a corpse, the perspiration poured&#xD;
down from every part of his body, in cold clammy streams ; . foam,&#xD;
streaked with blood, oozed out at the corners of his; mouth, and his&#xD;
eyes, wild and;bloodshot, rolled from side to side in mad, awful con-&#xD;
fusion.&#xD;
At length, after many ineffectual efforts to articulate, he gasped, in a&#xD;
hoarse whisper-&#xD;
"Man-or devil from the infernal regions--whatever you are, I&#xD;
accede to your terms"&#xD;
"'Tis well that you do," replied the lawyer, very calmly. And now,&#xD;
Col; Moody, I make you a present of these papers ; hereafter the other&#xD;
argument will be sufficient for my purpose ;" and Oliver Shephard&#xD;
reached the marriage certificates towards the Colonel, who grasped at&#xD;
them nervously, but, his palsied fingers refused their office, and the&#xD;
papers fell to the ground.&#xD;
" I will leave you now, Colonel, as you seem to be somewhat agitated,&#xD;
but I will call early to-morrow morning, when we will settle this little&#xD;
matter ; and this time, I pledge you my word of honor, that if I fail, I&#xD;
will, not seek remuneration from you. But good night, Col. Moody ,"&#xD;
and without waiting for a reply, Shephard turned on his heel and&#xD;
retraced his steps to the- fence, over which he leaped; and as he bent&#xD;
ahi steps toward a hotel a few blocks distant, helaughed in his throat&#xD;
with one of those dry, cough-like sounds, such as are only uttered by&#xD;
villains and prowling hyenas.-&#xD;
" Ech-ech-che !" he ejaculated. "That was a capital hit. The fool!&#xD;
to commit himself thus. I had always suspected him of the murder ;&#xD;
,but then suspicion is not eertainty. .wo, wtnesses---eoly! ebe  I was&#xD;
&#xD;

not within twenty miles;of the bridge any time during" the week thy:-&#xD;
the murder must have been committed.-,--Hoiwever, 6  is guilty of&#xD;
the crime, anid believes that I know it. That is suffieient and hene-&#xD;
forth he is mine to use 'as I will;" and- the lawyer terminated this&#xD;
soliloquy as he gained the steps of the hotel. For more than twenty&#xD;
minutes after Shephard left the garden, the colonel stood there irresc-&#xD;
lte,'his thoughts in a wild, confused chaos. One thing, however, was&#xD;
}    perfectly clear in his mind, and that was. that Shephard knew him to&#xD;
be a murderer ; and when Col. Moody at length left the garden, it was&#xD;
with the resolve that when Oliver Shephard had fulfilled the mission&#xD;
on which he was.to start in the morning, he should die. Such a purpose&#xD;
had once or twice entered his -heart - before, but now that his fortune&#xD;
good name, his very life, was in the keeping of a wretch more heart-&#xD;
less than himself, one only remedy remained, and that was death.&#xD;
Death to the lawyer-spy.&#xD;
On the very same day that this scene occurred, but earlier in-the&#xD;
afternoon, another-of a very different character was being enacted on&#xD;
the Niagara frontier.&#xD;
Edith Letts, whom we have lost sight of for so very long a time, was&#xD;
engaged in twining some woodbines, which she had planted under the&#xD;
windows of the old farmhouse, about the little frame-work that she&#xD;
had just constructed for their support. Nearly an hour she had been&#xD;
thus employed, when her attention was arrested by the sudden shutting&#xD;
of the gate which opened into the'yard; and looking up from her task&#xD;
she observed a tall, well-dressed man coming along up the little graveled&#xD;
walk towards the house.&#xD;
One moment she gazed upon the stranger in wonder, and the next,&#xD;
she bounded away down the path to meet him; and as she flung her-&#xD;
self into his open arms, she looked up into his face, exclaiming-.&#xD;
" Oh ! joy I joy ! My father ! my own dear father ; you have come&#xD;
at last for your poor Edith ! 0, you will take me home again, won't&#xD;
you, father ?"&#xD;
"I will, my child," replied the stranger, bending his lips downward,&#xD;
and imprinting a kiss upon Edith's forehead, as she lay there so happy,&#xD;
so childlike in his arms.&#xD;
You would never have guessed that the noble-looking stranger there&#xD;
in that fashionable suit of black, and the dark flowing locks slightly&#xD;
curling about the temples, and glossing in their texture as those of boy-&#xD;
hood, could have been the strange, uncouth being whom we once knew&#xD;
there on the Genesee, as the River Hermit.&#xD;
And yet such is the fact. His changed appearance might well hate&#xD;
deceived us-; but all his disguise was not proof against the quick per-&#xD;
ception of the maniac maiden's love.&#xD;
Edith's first joyous ery brought the kind-hearted old farmer to the&#xD;
door, where he beheld with surprise "his child," as he always called&#xD;
her, in the arms of a stranger ;bat Edith, after a few moments, ran up&#xD;
to him, crying out in infantile joy-&#xD;
"Oh! joy ! my own dear father has come 1"&#xD;
The Hermit (for so we must call him, having no other name) entered&#xD;
the house at the invitation of the- farmer, and in the explanation that&#xD;
ensued, he did not tell them that Edith was not his daughter ; but he&#xD;

a :carriage- which was driven. swiftly away over a road that led along&#xD;
the Niagara River about two miles below the town of Qiieeuston.&#xD;
beautiful little craft, which we know at once to be the yacht of&#xD;
Ben Letts, is moored alongside the bank ; and as the carriage which&#xD;
contains the Hermit and Edith stops only a few rods from the schooner,&#xD;
a man leaps to the shore-rubhes up to the carriage-there is two quick&#xD;
exclamations-" My brother !"-" Edith, my sister !"-and the Lake&#xD;
Bravo folds his long lost maniac sister to his heart.     hoar&#xD;
Five minutes more and the yacht is under weigh, and twenty&#xD;
afterwards, she was moored to the old wharf at Handford's, while Edith,&#xD;
the Bravo, and the Hermit were occupying the grotto.&#xD;
- CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
STEVE MAlRVELL' SUCCESS-HOMEWARD BOUND--A VISIT TO THLE CAVE--&#xD;
THE SECOND CRUSADE-A SOLEMN PLEDGE-TE HOME OF THE SMUG-&#xD;
GLER.&#xD;
A ATr of some fifteen rough-looking men were seated around at&#xD;
great roaring fire, which sent its broad tongues of cheerful flame far up&#xD;
the wide-throated, old-fashio~ned chimney of a huge log structure, situ-&#xD;
ated at the edge of a wild prairie, some twenty miles west of Chicago.&#xD;
It was one of those "log taverns" so common a few years ago all&#xD;
over the great west, but which are fast fading away before- the magic&#xD;
wand of improvement, giving place to more slightly modern hotels of&#xD;
intensely red bricks, so flame-colored that the very sight of them is&#xD;
almost suficient to throw off a violent ague chill, or set a well, maninto&#xD;
a fever; while another crop sprung up of long, narrow, two-story frame&#xD;
buildings, so very white that a single glance at one of them, somehow&#xD;
makes one feel chilly even in the summer-time, and threatens to freeze&#xD;
him in the winter.&#xD;
One look about the- interior of this prairie inn, and you would have&#xD;
been satisfied that if there was little show of elegance or refinement,&#xD;
there was ample promise of comfort..&#xD;
There were-no halls and stair-ways, and spare rooms, but like the&#xD;
generality of dwellings on the western frontier, the whole vast interi&#xD;
of that log edifice was one single room. warmed and lighted by a Single&#xD;
fire, which, like the apartment, was constructed on a grand scale.&#xD;
Here and there, along the "log walls," were ranged, dlikedberthsa a&#xD;
hospital ward, substantial beds, while in the centre of the-room stood&#xD;
a' rough  iae table, spread with a coarse bat, clean cloth of domestic&#xD;
fabric,     i(nt 4"g roami "," as aovelista .have, it) literally covered-&#xD;
&#xD;
.*N&#xD;
&#xD;
loaded with smokingviands, all in perfect keeping with the times, the&#xD;
-It was the evening of one of the first days of November, 1838, and a&#xD;
wilder, more boisterous night was scarce ever known on the prairies or&#xD;
in the " oak openings" of the west. Rain, hail, and sleet, pelted against&#xD;
the window panes, while the wind howled and screamed as if in envious&#xD;
wrath at the comfort of those within, so snugly sheltered from its fury.&#xD;
The party about the fire were hunters, on their return from a sum.&#xD;
fer tour in the far western wilds, about the head waters of the Mis.-&#xD;
There Was one of the number-a very young man, scarcely more than&#xD;
a boy in years-who sat a little apart from his compreanions taking&#xD;
part in the conversation, and most of the time with his elbows resting&#xD;
on his knees and his face buried in his hands. There was an air of&#xD;
settled melancholy on his features that was almost painful to look a&#xD;
and it seemed as if he never could have smiled, he was so sad.&#xD;
I am not very fond of mystery, and so I will tell you that the b&#xD;
misanthrope there by the fire among those rough-lookingon&#xD;
other than our hero,.-Stanly Morris.&#xD;
Supper was announced, and the party of hunters was preparing to&#xD;
gather around the board, when their movements were arrested by a&#xD;
loud hail outside, that rang out above the wild elemental war like the&#xD;
hoarse roar of some old' triton borne on the midnight gale from a ship&#xD;
near by. in the gloom to windward.&#xD;
"House a-h-o-y- I" and the next moment-there was a tatoo beat on the&#xD;
door, apparently with the foot and fist, accompanied with the lusty&#xD;
shouts of-" Come, bear a hand inside there. Heave ahead, land.&#xD;
lord."&#xD;
Some five or six of the hunters sprang to the door, and the foremost&#xD;
among the number -was Stanly Morris who had already recognized the&#xD;
voiceof his sailor friend, Steve Marvell, as doubtless the reade has done&#xD;
at the -first shout.&#xD;
'TLhe heavy fastenings of the door were drawn aside-ngit was flung open,&#xD;
and in among the astonished group like a rocket, plunged a being, but&#xD;
so strange a lookig one, that if they had not just heard his voice, not&#xD;
one of the party would have ever suspected him of being human.&#xD;
Milton, in all the fertility of his imagination, never created so hideous&#xD;
a looking monster in all his army of devils.&#xD;
It was Steve though, beyond a doubt; for as soon as he was fairly&#xD;
inside and the door closed, he sung out-y&#xD;
"Here you are ! bung up and bilge free-all square by the lifts and&#xD;
braces," 1'nd then he- made a motion as if to disrobe; but before he&#xD;
doff so, let us take a look 4t him. We never shall see such another&#xD;
speeninen of the genus homo;&#xD;
His outside garment was the skin of a black cow, wrn like a cloak&#xD;
with the part that covered the head of the animal covering the head&#xD;
of the sailor, with the horns on and 'canted forward at just about the&#xD;
snipe angle as Angelo's devil's antlers.&#xD;
neerneatithis cow-skin hood he wore, in plae of' a sou'wester, a&#xD;
small-sized straw bee-hive, and about his body was bound at leasttwo&#xD;
good-sized bundles of wheat straw, the butts coining quite' up to his ,&#xD;

ar s, and the top reaching to his feeat, secured at the bottom bya stout,&#xD;
twisted band of the same material, so that when he threw off his cow-&#xD;
skin, he resembled more-a locomotive straw-stack than anything human.&#xD;
After a few moments, however, Steve came out of his straw envelop,.&#xD;
bee-hive and all, and stood there among the wondering hunters in the&#xD;
full costume of a Sioux war chief.&#xD;
Not a, single word did he utter during thetiehahewsd-&#xD;
engaging himself from his straw and raw-hide habiliments; but now he&#xD;
seized Stanly by both hands, and after .nearly dislocatingg both, his&#xD;
shoulders with the shaking he gave them, he began the history of.his&#xD;
cruise; but happening to cast his eyes towards the table, he suddenly&#xD;
checked himself and said-,.&#xD;
"I say, shipmates, it strikes me I'man keepeinufromon yur grub&#xD;
"    asimts'i       tie     eImkeigyufo             orguNow, don't wait for me : gather round, and I'll come in among ye, spin-&#xD;
ning my yarn as I eat, for I'm as hungry as a shovel-nosed shark after&#xD;
a month's short allowance."&#xD;
As arbitrary circumstances hurries us foward to other matters of a&#xD;
more general interest, we will only stay long enough to hear the closing&#xD;
paragraph of Steve's adventurous cruise.&#xD;
" Sometimes;' he observed, looking across the table to Stanly;&#xD;
'sometimes I would get almost within hail of you, and then all at once&#xD;
ou'a set to, gallant sails and out stun'sails, and off you'd go, leaving&#xD;
me hull down astern. I stood on to west'ard until I got into shoal&#xD;
water among the Sioux, where I was obliged to bend this suit of Indian&#xD;
toggery in the place of my old fit, which was getting like a blubber&#xD;
hunter's topsail after a three years' cruise. I fell in with a hunter,&#xD;
crafteu at pst. Peter's, who told me that you'd tacked ship and stood&#xD;
back the eastward, and so I cracked on all sail in chase again,&#xD;
baking very good weather of it the whole passage, until about an hour&#xD;
a,  vhenrthis galeo'wind caught me all aback, and I've been backing&#xD;
and filling about here, ever since the squall had struck me, in search of&#xD;
a harbor. About half an hour ago, when I was almost froze, I ran&#xD;
afoul of a little yard, fenced in out here on the prairie, where I found&#xD;
that cow-jacket, the old straw tarpaulin which I bent, and then just as&#xD;
I had shingled myself from a straw-stack, I made a light bearing about&#xD;
N. E., dead to lee'ard, and so ye see I up helm and run down for it,&#xD;
scudd ingsquare before the wind, and under a whole cow-hide and close-&#xD;
reefed bee-hive; and here I am, shipmates, overhauled the chase at&#xD;
last, in a snug harbor for the night, all square by the lifts and braces."&#xD;
After supper, Stanly Morris and his sailor friend drew their seats a&#xD;
little apart from the others, where, for more than an hour, Stanly sat&#xD;
and listened to Steve's account of all that had transpired during' his&#xD;
absence; and as the warmhearted sailor pictured the scene as he be-&#xD;
held it, of the "Island home," the beautiful cottage, and the faithful&#xD;
but-almost despairing girl, watching there like the gentle Medora for&#xD;
her Conrad, Stanly Morris-'was once more' very ,nearly happy. He&#xD;
knewthatKate was true to him and to her lighted word, and for the&#xD;
rest he would challenge fate' itself.h&#xD;
art sundown, on the day after this scene occurred at the log inn, the&#xD;
part of hunters arrived at Chicago just in time to embark in the last&#xD;
steamer of the season for buffalo.&#xD;
&#xD;

THE = JA1C BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
All along the frontier oni the American side, bands of "sympathisers"&#xD;
were gathering at various points, and preparing .for another winter&#xD;
campaign. ButStanly and Steve steadily refused to.have anything to&#xD;
do with the movement, while nearly all of their companions and fellow&#xD;
voyagers left the steamer and joined the patriot standard, under which&#xD;
the majority of them had served at Point atx Pelee.&#xD;
Arrived at Buffalo, -the , two friends proceeded directly to Lewiston,&#xD;
where they embarked in the lake steamer bound for Ogdensburgh.&#xD;
When the steamer arrived at her wharf at Carthage, only about a&#xD;
Saboe the Hermit's cave, the leftrerand took their way towards&#xD;
the old landing, with the intention of returning and going on in the&#xD;
boat in case they should not find any one at the cave.&#xD;
This intention was abandoned, however; for they soon discovered a&#xD;
person whom one glance assured them was Ben Letts, the Bravo.&#xD;
Stanly and Steve bounded away down the steep hill side--there was&#xD;
a glad, warmhearted greeting, a welcome from the Bravo, a laborious&#xD;
passage upth winding pathway, and the two returned wanderers were&#xD;
seated there in the inner cave with Ben Letts and the beautiful Edith&#xD;
but the Hermit was not there.&#xD;
After an hour spent by Letts in relating a hundred incidents that&#xD;
occurred during their absence, he informed them that the Hermit had&#xD;
been gone more than a week on a tour which he intended to make&#xD;
along the frontier between Sackett's Harbor and Ogdensburgh, for&#xD;
purpose of conferring with several of the patriot leaders, and assist-&#xD;
igto organize a force which was to assemble at Ogdensburgh, under&#xD;
le l irge, preparatory to the invasion of Canada. He had sent his&#xD;
hife schooner to convey to Sackett's Harbor the Hermit and several of&#xD;
his friends, among whom was a gallant Polish exile named Van Sholtz&#xD;
who had recently been appointed a colonel in the patriot army.&#xD;
He was hourly expecting her return, when he intended to embark&#xD;
with his sister and some thirty friends to the patriot cause, who had&#xD;
assembled at the old warehouse down at the wharf, and proceed at once&#xD;
to Ogdensburgh; and he invited his two friends to join the expedition.&#xD;
He would, he informed Stanly, touch at French Creek on his way&#xD;
down the river, and leave Edith with Kate-take on board a few friends&#xD;
who bad promised to meet him there, and then hurry on to join the&#xD;
army of the second Canadian crusade, at Ogdensburgh.&#xD;
It is almost an invariable rule with story-tellers, to paint their he-&#xD;
roes and heroines as perfect models of perfection. I must deviate from&#xD;
the popular, beaten track, and show ours just as they are---a lovely girl,&#xD;
pure in her nature, constant in her worship to her heart's idol, but pos&#xD;
sessing much of that stern, reckless defiance of all conventional rules&#xD;
which has for- so many years characterized her father's career. Kate&#xD;
Johnson was a glorious creature, but not quite an angel ; and Stanl&#xD;
a brave, noble-hearted young man, frank in his nature and trusting, in' his&#xD;
Confidence. A few of the better feelings of his generous heart had be&#xD;
pervertedby the cruel injustice that he had suffered at te han&#xD;
Canadian tyranny; but all the nobler attributes of our nature had&#xD;
found a home in his breast. And yet he was not at all perfect. His&#xD;
impulsive nature prompted him to make the enemies of his friends his&#xD;
own; and as he reflected upon the foul wrongs of his friend, his enmity&#xD;

&#xD;
towards those who had inflicted those wrongs grew into hate, and hate&#xD;
whispered vengeance in his ear, till his heart responded to the call and&#xD;
his band was ready to grasp the sword, and lead the way where any&#xD;
dared to follow, in the second Canadian crusade.&#xD;
Under the oath usually administered at, that period to the Canadian&#xD;
"hunters," by the most solemn pledges, Stanly Morris, there in the solid&#xD;
tude of the cave, bound himself to the fortunes of a cause if not unjust,&#xD;
at least illegal. In this he was doubtless wrong, but his apology I&#xD;
have already written; I know no other, and if this be insufficient; he&#xD;
must suffer.&#xD;
Steve Marvell took the oath, and gave his pledge, partly because&#xD;
Stanly had done so, and partly because his old friend, "Capt. Ben,"&#xD;
was engaged in the new revolutionary movement, but mainly for the&#xD;
love he bore to the wronged Edith, in whose behalf he determined to&#xD;
strike one good blow for vengeance, and he prayed that that blow&#xD;
might fall upon the heartless libertine, Col. Henry Moody.&#xD;
Three days went by, during which time the subject of the contem-&#xD;
plated invasion was frequently discussed by the three friends at the&#xD;
cave, and nightly among some fifty persons who had also embarked in&#xD;
the crusade,,and who had taken up their temporary residence in the&#xD;
old dilapidated buildings near the wharf. The morning of the fourth&#xD;
day came, and Steve, as he emerged from the cave, discovered the yacht&#xD;
moored at the landing, where she had arrived during the night.&#xD;
The intelligence was soon communicated to those within the cave,&#xD;
and immediate preparations were made for embarking.&#xD;
In less than two hours, all were on board-the three friends, Edith,&#xD;
the fifty patriots from the old buildings, and the yacht was again under&#xD;
weigh, standing down the river and bound for the St. Lawrence.&#xD;
At twelve o'clock on the day after she left Handford's landing, the&#xD;
little yacht rounded to, alongside one of the wharves in the village of&#xD;
Clayton, where she was welcomed with three hearty cheers from the&#xD;
people on the shores.&#xD;
Stanly, accompanied by his two friends and Edith, left the schooner&#xD;
and proceeded at once to the home of the Smuggler, where they were&#xD;
met by Old Bill himself, who fairly shouted with delight, as he bade&#xD;
them welcome, and invited them to enter.&#xD;
The meeting between the lovers, after so long a separation--....&#xD;
Reader, please imagine it, as you have done once before, thereby leav-&#xD;
ing me room in this chapters to tell you that Edith Letts loved her,&#xD;
new sister Kate from the first moment that she saw her ; Kate also&#xD;
loved her, and determined to win her back-back to reason and happi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
Another thing I have to tell you, which, strange as it may appear, is&#xD;
nevertheless true.&#xD;
When Kate learned that Stanly had bound himself to the crusade,&#xD;
instead of seeking to keep him back, she urged him on-she would&#xD;
have loved him less had he forfeited his oath for her; and so he sailed&#xD;
again that night for Ogdensburgh.&#xD;

THE INVASION-THE SIEGE-A DASTARD GENERAL-THE WIND-MILL FOR-&#xD;
TRESS--THE BoY HERO AGAIN--DESPERATION OP THE INVADERS--A&#xD;
FATAL EXPEDIENT.&#xD;
ANOTHER winter picture. A patriot camp, more exposed, more com-&#xD;
fortless than that of Point au Pelee or Navy Island.&#xD;
On the American side of the River St. Lawrence, near Ogdensburg,&#xD;
were assembled some twelve hundred men and boys for the invasion of&#xD;
Canada. For a whole month they had' been gathering from the frontier&#xD;
villages and towns along the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario.&#xD;
These twelve hundred men and boys, with less than a week's pro-&#xD;
visions-almost hemmed in by a cordon of United States troops who&#xD;
were marching thither to disperse them-these made up the second and&#xD;
last crusading army of American sympathisers.&#xD;
With this rabble host, it was determined to invade Canada, then&#xD;
swarming with twenty-six thousand of the choicest troops in the British&#xD;
army, and full one half of their inhabitants loyal to the crown.&#xD;
At a council of war held during the fore part of the night, it had&#xD;
been determined to attack the town and garrison of Prescott, on the&#xD;
opposite side of the river, here more than a mile in width.&#xD;
The British garrison consisted of only about six- hundred men, and&#xD;
it was voted that a detachment of three hundred patriots should cross&#xD;
the river at day-light, land at a point near some old wind-mills a.&#xD;
mile below the town, and when the British garrison sallied out to&#xD;
attack them, they were. to fall back ; thus drawing the enemy from&#xD;
his entrenchments, and then the main body of the patriot army were&#xD;
to cross over, cut off their retreat,.and bring them between two fires.&#xD;
The majority of the officers who voted for this fool-hardy project,&#xD;
counted confidently upon an easy victory. Very few of them were&#xD;
aware that those soldiers were veterans of fifty battle fields-the famous&#xD;
15th, who had -served in Egypt through the whole Peninsular war,&#xD;
under the "Iron Duke," and whose proudest boast was, that they had&#xD;
never turned their backs to an enemy.&#xD;
Some few there were, however, who knew and remembered all this ;&#xD;
and they voted against the mad adventure ; but when their council was&#xD;
overruled, and the invasion was determined upon, they stepped forth,&#xD;
the very first volunteers to lead the forlorn hope.&#xD;
First among these gallant fellows, was the brave Polish exile, who&#xD;
had battled for the liberty of his native land, till the last spark of&#xD;
freedom was quenched by Russian bayonets; and then he sought our&#xD;
shores. He was a true patriot, and his noble qualities will be remem-&#xD;
bered when the memory of the Canadian tyrants who caused his death&#xD;
shall have sunk into oblivion in the dim vista of the past. The Polish&#xD;
exile, Col. Van Sholtz, was the first to volunteer, and was appointed as&#xD;
the commander of the expedition.&#xD;
Then cane forward the giant old Smuggler-ohief, the Lake Pirate,&#xD;
followed by the Hermit, of the Genesee, and Ben Letts, the Bravo, and&#xD;
Stanly Morris and Steve Marvell, each and all of whom knew the dan-&#xD;

ger and madness of the proposed plan of attack. They had argued and&#xD;
voted against it, but now that it was decided, they were the first to step&#xD;
forward and brave the danger.&#xD;
Desperate as the undertaking was, there was no lack of volunteers,&#xD;
and long before midnight, everything was arranged, and three hundred&#xD;
men from among three times that number, who came.forward eager to&#xD;
cross the river, had been selected, and once more all was still in the&#xD;
patriot camp.&#xD;
Morning came and the keen, biting north wind came sweeping down&#xD;
over the distant snow-clad hills, and -across the river, piercing to the&#xD;
very vitals of that starving, ill-clothed patriot host.&#xD;
The first pale rays of the- morning sun shone--upon three hundred&#xD;
invaders, marshaled there on the Canadian shore, each grasping his&#xD;
trusty rifle, and wading through snow drifts more than two feet deep,&#xD;
towards their red-coated enemies, who were defiling by platoons from&#xD;
the gates of the fortress, to meet them.&#xD;
Two small steamers and a schooner, in which they had crossed the&#xD;
river, had been sent back for the remainder of the army, and so they&#xD;
must fight till reinforcements arrived,-for they could not retreat.&#xD;
On came the British, with a force one thousand strong, outnumber-&#xD;
ing the little army of boys more than three to one ; besides, the English&#xD;
troops were dragging with them five or six pieces of light artillery, with&#xD;
which they could easily decimate the patriot ranks, while they them-&#xD;
selves remained unharmed, beyond the range of ordinary rifle shot.&#xD;
Van Sholtz comprehended the enemy's advantage, and gave orders&#xD;
to fall back and occupy the two old wind-mills, which he had no doubt&#xD;
they might be able to hold against the whole British force, till the main&#xD;
body of the patriots could cross to' his assistance.&#xD;
Slowly and in complete array the three hundred invaders took pos-&#xD;
session of the two old structures, and were soon completely surrounded&#xD;
by that British host.&#xD;
It was but a dreary prospect for that little army of patriots, hemmed&#xD;
in as they were by an enemy possessing a park of artillery, with which&#xD;
they had already. opened a fire on the mills. Still they faltered not;&#xD;
but, sheltered behind the solid walls, picked off their red-coat foes at&#xD;
long shot, with their unerring rifles.&#xD;
Two, three hours, went by and many an anxious glande was cast&#xD;
towards the American shore, where lay the two steamers and the little&#xD;
schooner which they had- sent back, and not a single movement aboard&#xD;
the vessels, or in the camp, gave indication of embarking for the rescue.&#xD;
Afterwards, the patriot commander pleaded as his excuse. that he&#xD;
had been forbidden to cross the river by the United States Marshal;&#xD;
but this most- sapient commander-in-chief, Major Gen.' Birge, of the&#xD;
patriot army, lay in his tent all that day, totally insensible of his duty,&#xD;
obligation or dignity, inasmuch as--- Captain Saunders, one of his&#xD;
aids, said that he had been second to the General in eight personal&#xD;
encounters that morning before sunrisq, and that each time his adver-&#xD;
sarie's shot had taken effect in the General's neck.&#xD;
The British commander, growing impatient of delay, at last gave&#xD;
orders to storm the wind-mills, and from every side they rushed for-&#xD;
ward to the assault.-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE.LAKE BRAVO.           "9&#xD;
,3ut -with a cool, determined bravery that would have graced a better&#xD;
cause, the boy heroes of the wind-mills rallied to every. window and&#xD;
opening in those old stone fabrics; and as, the foes came within' point&#xD;
blank range of their rifles, they dropped, them so fast that it seemed&#xD;
every leaden messenger went right- home to its mark. For, a few mo-&#xD;
menta,-they struggled on against that terrible 'whirlwind of death, and&#xD;
then  broke their ranks and fled before the pelting storm  of rifle&#xD;
bullets.'&#xD;
Again they rallied, and again were defeated and driven back.&#xD;
And thus, as the tedious hours wore away, the fight went on. Here,&#xD;
one of the finest regiments in the whole British army, and backed by&#xD;
more- than four hundred colonial militia, with a park of artillery,&#xD;
maintaining that obstinate fight, against a mere handful of boys,. not&#xD;
one-third their own strength in point of numbers, but defended by the&#xD;
massive walls of those old mills, and each armed with one of those terri-&#xD;
ble American rifles that sent its whizzing death-messenger right home&#xD;
to the brain or heart of the foe, at which it was aimed.&#xD;
. All throughout the day the fire had beenkept up from theold mills,&#xD;
by these expert marksmen, who loaded their rifles in security behind&#xD;
the thick walls, and then presenting themselves only for an instant at&#xD;
thewindows, they would fire, and fall back under cover of the walls&#xD;
again so quick, that they always eluded the more tardy aim of the&#xD;
British soldiers.&#xD;
But among that poi ion of the little garrison stationed on the fourth&#xD;
floor, there was one who disdained to seek the shelter of the thick walls&#xD;
as a -protection against the British bullets. All'day long, ever since&#xD;
the fight commenced, he had stood there exposed in the open window,&#xD;
loading and deliberately firing his heavy rifle, and almost every shot&#xD;
bringing down his scarlet-coated target, while all the time the bullets&#xD;
from the English muskets were whizzing past, and pattering about him&#xD;
on the old wall thick as hail. He was but a boy in years, of slight&#xD;
form, delicate features, and soft, fair hair; but the quick flashes of his&#xD;
clear blue eyes, as he marked the effect of his rapid shots, told of a lion&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
This boy hero is the same that kneeled there beside the midnight&#xD;
watch-fire, swearing to perform the last behest of tfie gallant Hoadly,&#xD;
who fell at Point au Pelee-Charles Gillet, the same who so deliber-&#xD;
ately shot down the British soldier there on the ice, and afterwards&#xD;
escaped in the Bravo's ice-boat.&#xD;
Five times the attack .was renewed, and each time the British troops&#xD;
were driven back in wild confusion by the death-dealing rifles of the&#xD;
invaders. All around the grim old mills, within the reach of those&#xD;
heavy American rifles, the snow was dyed with human gore, and nore&#xD;
than two hundred red-coated soldiers lay dead, freezing in the cold,&#xD;
wintry air, while within the old mills not more than twenty persons had&#xD;
fallen, and these had met their death by reckless exposure in the open&#xD;
windows.&#xD;
But there were enemies within the walls of those old mills which&#xD;
were fast driving these indomitable spirits to desperation. These were&#xD;
hunger; thirst, and intense cold. Many had flung themselves down in&#xD;
sullen despair, praying for death to end their tortures, while others&#xD;

v&#xD;

THE EMPRES OF PTHE ISLES; OR,&#xD;
flung away their rides, and recklessly exposed themselves in the 'Open&#xD;
Windows as targets for British muskets. Many talked of rushing forth,&#xD;
hurling g themselves upon the besieging force, and seeking death upon&#xD;
the points of their bayonets, or at the muzzles of their cannon ; but no&#xD;
one spoke o thought of surrender, or coward flight.&#xD;
Many were the clenched fists shaken from the-windows of those old&#xD;
wind-mills in the direction of the patriot camp on the American sido,&#xD;
and many were the bitter curses heaped upon the miserable inebriate&#xD;
general, who having it in his power to relieve them, had remained there&#xD;
inactive, without one single effort to avert the certain ruin which men-&#xD;
aced them.&#xD;
The generous Van Sholtz in the one, and Letts, Stanly Morris, and&#xD;
the iron-hearted old smuggler in the other of the wind-mill fortresses,&#xD;
cheered and encouraged, and did all that brave men could do, to keep&#xD;
up the spirits of their companions; but arguments of patience are of&#xD;
little avail to men rendered frantic by cold, hunger and thirst; and&#xD;
each moment, as their situation became more desperate, they became&#xD;
more reckless of life, and showed less respect for the opinions of those&#xD;
whom, under other circumstances, they would have followed to the&#xD;
death.&#xD;
tt was almost sundown, and now each moment some perishing, frost-&#xD;
bitten wretci sunk down, gibbering out a half intelligible curse.upon&#xD;
those who had led him thither, and died perhaps with a blasphemy&#xD;
gurgling in his throat,&#xD;
"Wall up the windows and keep out the cold t" was shouted by spme&#xD;
person in the larger of the two mills; and in an instant, above, below,&#xD;
on every floor, and back from the other mill, which was near at hand,&#xD;
came the mad cry of-..-" Wall up the windows i"&#xD;
In, spite of' every remonstrance on the part of Van Sholtz, Johnson,&#xD;
Letts, and Stanly, nothing was now heard but-" Wall up the windows&#xD;
and shut out the cold !"&#xD;
Neither of the buildings had ever been completed, and a huge pile&#xD;
of stones bad been left on the ground within the mills; and with this&#xD;
material the freezing, starving wretches began to wall, up the open&#xD;
windows.&#xD;
The British cannon and musketry, which bad all day been playing&#xD;
on the mills, suddenly became silent. But when at last the little gar-&#xD;
rison were beginning to congratulate each other on their success in&#xD;
fencing out the wind, the cannonade commenced more furiously than&#xD;
ever, hurling the loose stones from the windows down upon the heads&#xD;
of those within, and crushing to death, at a single fire, more than had&#xD;
been slain throughout the whole day.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI,&#xD;
A REVELATION--THE SIGNAL GUN-THE SORTIE-THE SMUGGLER'S ARTI-&#xD;
FICE--MODERN BRITISH HUMANITY-THE COMMANDER OF THE YACHT--&#xD;
TILE PRISONERS.&#xD;
AT the patriot camp, near Ogdensburgh, on the night before the&#xD;
fatal expedition was planned, Stanly Morris had for the first time niet&#xD;
the mysterious man whom we have thus far known as the Hermit.&#xD;
Stanly had been at the camp for.nearly a month, but the Hermit&#xD;
had been absent on business connected with the invasion; so that they&#xD;
had not been introduced to each other, nor had they ever spoken&#xD;
until after the siege of the wind-mills commenced. Then, more than&#xD;
two hours after the battle had commenced, Stanly suddenly asked his&#xD;
companion some question ; and at the very first sound of AIe young&#xD;
officer's voice, the Hermit started as though he had been smitten with&#xD;
an electric shock.&#xD;
"MyGod !" he exclaimed, " that voice--" and grasping Staily's&#xD;
arm, he looked into his face for a few moments, as if he would read hid&#xD;
very soul; and then relinquishing his hold, he shook his head and whis-&#xD;
pered, scarcely above his breath---&#xD;
" No, no, 'tia impossible;. and yet the voice and features, and even&#xD;
that almost angel smile, are all her's ;" and then he walked away to&#xD;
the opposite side of the old mill, without answering the question which&#xD;
Stanly had asked him.&#xD;
- After that, nothing further passed between them till after the mad'&#xD;
project of walling up the windows had been effected, when the first can-&#xD;
non shot dashed in the whole of one of the windows ; several were&#xD;
killed outright, and many others most horribly mangled.&#xD;
Among these was the Hermit. His right arm was torn entirely&#xD;
away at-the shoulder by a fragment of rock, and another had mangled&#xD;
his breast in the most awful manner, while a third, or perhaps the ball&#xD;
itself, had crushed both legs just above the knee. The force of the&#xD;
missiles which had thus mutilated his body, sent him whirling nearly&#xD;
across the apartment, and he was flung against Stanly with such vio-&#xD;
lence that both were borne to the floor together.&#xD;
As they fell, a miniature.that Stanly had received from the old min-&#xD;
ister at French Creek as that of his mother, dropped from his bosom,&#xD;
and hung about his neck in such a way that the first glance of the&#xD;
Hermit fell upon the exquisite face, and quick as thought he tore the&#xD;
picture from the ribbon by which it was suspended.&#xD;
"Almighty God !" he almost screamed, as he sunk down upon the&#xD;
cold floor, still clutching the miniature in his remaining hand, and all&#xD;
regardless of his wounds, pressed it convulsively to his lips.&#xD;
" This--this picture-whoI how came you ?-O, God ?" he exclaimed,&#xD;
in broken accents, while his eyes wandered from the face of the lovely&#xD;
creatpIre on the ivory, to that of the young man now kneeling beside&#xD;
him, and then back to the picture again.&#xD;
"It is my mother's picture," said Stanly, half bewildered by the&#xD;
strange scene.&#xD;

" Your mother ! 0, tell me her name ?  Does she live? QuickI&#xD;
quick ! before-I die !"&#xD;
" My mother died when I was but 4hree days old, and her name was&#xD;
Linda-"&#xD;
"My wife ! my lost Linda !" screamed the dying man. " But your&#xD;
own name?"&#xD;
Stanly. It was my mother's dying wish that I -should be thus-&#xD;
named."&#xD;
a Stanly--my- own name," murmured the Hermit ; and then he&#xD;
gasped forth, as be essayed to draw Stanly's face nearer to his own,&#xD;
gMysonp-child of my wronged wife-named after myself too-0,&#xD;
she was all that was pure land good, and I believed her false !"&#xD;
" Ah, William Johnson," he went on, as his gaze rested upon the&#xD;
giant proportions of the smuggler, who at .that moment appeared from&#xD;
below and knelt beside him ; "you will know me now, William John-&#xD;
son. Do ou not recognize the features of---. O, you knew me well&#xD;
in my boyhood. I was Stanly Alwyn, eldest son and heir to the noble&#xD;
Earl of Dalhousie.&#xD;
"-Of my marriage with the beautiful Linda Morris you could not&#xD;
ae' known, or it occurred long after you-left Canada.,&#xD;
" But I must be brief, for life's sands are ebbing fast. Come closer,&#xD;
my son-closer, William Johnson-ay, and you too, Benjamin Letts.&#xD;
There,:now listen:&#xD;
"Ere three weeks of my wedded: life had gone by, a human serpent&#xD;
found his way into our little Eden, and changed my heaven into hell.&#xD;
You know him-Oliver Shephard, the base spy. But he had another'&#xD;
name-Richard Delamere-first a minister of the gospel, then a lawyer,&#xD;
and last of all' a spy.&#xD;
"I Believe, him when he showed me letters in the hand writing of&#xD;
my wife-letters which proved her guilty of improper-nay, criminal&#xD;
connexions with my own brother, two years younger than myself. Yes,&#xD;
I believed it then, and in my mad infatuation I accused the angel&#xD;
woman of a crime that I will-not name in the presence of our child.&#xD;
Ay more than this, I raised my arm against her whose pure heart had&#xD;
never harbored an unchaste thought. 0 God I Istruck her down with&#xD;
my clenched fist, and trampled upon 'her with my feet in my demoniac&#xD;
fury.&#xD;
"I fled from the house, and when I returned again, two days after&#xD;
wards, she was gone-gone with only her clothes, and a large sum in&#xD;
gold, which was her own property.,&#xD;
" In a letter which she left for me, she asserted her innocence, and&#xD;
forgave my brutal treatment, but informed me that I should never see&#xD;
her again.&#xD;
"For more than two years they said I was mad ; and then, when&#xD;
my reason came back to me, I learned all the- infernal plot. It was my&#xD;
own brother who would be the Earl of Dalhousie., and that-arch villain,&#xD;
Richard Delanmere, who sought to make my angel wife the victim of his&#xD;
Unholy passion.&#xD;
I fled from Canada, when the law.said I was insane, and could not&#xD;
inherit- my father's letters and estates; My brother became Earl of&#xD;
Dalhousie-Richard Delainere received ten thousand pounds as the&#xD;

price of his villany, and I-for more than fourteen years =I remained&#xD;
there in the cave, brooding over my wrongs,.and waiting for the day to&#xD;
come when I-could strike one good blow for vengeance.&#xD;
I am dying before my purpose is accomplished; but my son, Stanly&#xD;
Alwyn, rightful heir to the Earldom and estates of DalhousieWil-&#xD;

-As God hears us ! we will-be most terribly avenged on the vile&#xD;
miscreant !" swore the giant old smuggler, the desperate bravo, and&#xD;
Stanly Morris-henceforth Stanly Alwyn---as they knelt there- beside&#xD;
the dying man, with bared heads and uplifted hands.&#xD;
Thanks, my friends," murmured the crushed man; and then.,e&#xD;
gasped-" Stanly--my son--your ear. - Quick--.I augoig--nearer !---&#xD;
so-isten. Go to the cave-ia the---ehaube---gold--papers-Edith&#xD;
A convulsive shudder passed over him.-his under jaw fell and the.&#xD;
mysterous Hermit, Manly Alwyn, father of our hero, and rightful Earl&#xD;
of Dalhousie, sunk down upon the cold floor a ghastly corpse.&#xD;
Atthis moment the distant report of a cannon fell faintly upon the&#xD;
ears of the little group; the next breath Steve Marvell came from the&#xD;
loft above to inform his friends that the yacht was abreast of the old&#xD;
wind-mills.and close in with the ,shore, and he was. satisfied 'that her&#xD;
un was fired as -a signal, to Inform them that she had come to their&#xD;
rescue."&#xD;
The yacht had, been sent back to French Creek immediately after&#xD;
Letts and his friends had landed from her at thepatriot camp, more&#xD;
than a month previous, and they could not imagine who it was that&#xD;
coul   ave brought her dwn the river; but her low, snake-like hull-&#xD;
and tall, raking masts, assured each and all of the friends that-she was&#xD;
indeed no other than the little Edith ; and they were equally well&#xD;
assured that they should be perfectly safe, provided they ceuld manage&#xD;
to .get, on board .of her.&#xD;
This they had determined to attempt, when a wild, prolonged yell,&#xD;
rang out from the other millThe cry was caught up and echoed back&#xD;
by those about them, who rushed out to join their comrades in the&#xD;
dreadful. melee, leaving the four friends, who stood there in. the fast-&#xD;
coining shades of night, about the dead body of Stanly's father, the only&#xD;
occupants of:the dreary old mill,&#xD;
The roar of cannon suddenly ceased, but all around the old wind-mill&#xD;
the murderous hand-to-hand fight. was raging in all its horrible And&#xD;
revolting- details.&#xD;
l'r five minutes -the work of slaughter and destruction had been&#xD;
raging without, when the smuggler, snatching up the body of Stanly's  /&#xD;
father as ;though it had been that of an infant, thus addressed his com-&#xD;
panions&#xD;
.My friends,.there is but a bare possibility for us to escape.- Now&#xD;
it. is very certain that ,the yacht is .manned by our friends, who will&#xD;
assist-us provided we-can-gain the shore. I advise that each one of us,&#xD;
aq we. sally out, select the body of a dead soldier, and fit ourselves out&#xD;
in their red coats and bear-skin shakos, in which we may easily pass for-&#xD;
British -soldiers..&#xD;

&#xD;
" As for myself, if I gain the yacht at all,I shall bear this body with&#xD;
me ; and as we may get separated in the darkness and confusion, I&#xD;
further advise you all three to make for the river as nearly abreast of&#xD;
the yacht as possible."&#xD;
All promised to obey these instructions. Before thirty seconds, how-&#xD;
ever, had elapsed, they were separated, as Johnson had feared, by the&#xD;
mad whirlwind-of that terrible night massacre. The British soldiers&#xD;
fought more like fiends than men who wore the garb of Christians.&#xD;
? One poor fellow, a captain in the little patriot army, so faint and&#xD;
frozen that he could scarcely support himself, encountered a British&#xD;
captain with whom he had been on terms of the most intimate friend-&#xD;
ship.&#xD;
" Thank God I Arthur," he exclaimed, as he staggered forward, and&#xD;
clasped his arms around the British captain. He would have added&#xD;
something more, but this very Christian friend in the scarlet uniform&#xD;
clutched him by the throat, and stabbed the half-frozen suppliant to the&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Comments upon such acts as these are altogether needless. The&#xD;
bravery of British officers and soldiers is, and has long 'been, beyond a&#xD;
question ; but their character for humanity is not so well established&#xD;
The smuggler, without stopping to -disguise himself as he had.pro.&#xD;
posed to the others, made the best of his way to the shore, where, within&#xD;
five minutes, he was joined by Letts, accompanied by about a dozen&#xD;
others, not one of whom had seen anything of Stanly or Steve Marvell.&#xD;
Almost at the instant that Letts and his companions reached the&#xD;
river, two boats from the yacht, which was lying off at a little distance,&#xD;
pulled in to the bank, in one of which the smuggler placed his lifeless&#xD;
burden; and, as he' did - so, a hand was laid upon his arms, another.&#xD;
twined affectionately about his neck, and a low, musical voice whispered&#xD;
in his ear the word-&#xD;
" Father."&#xD;
" In the name of God ! what are you doing here, my child?" inquired&#xD;
the astonished smuggler, as he folded his brave girl in his arms, and&#xD;
strained her to his heart.&#xD;
" I have come here in command of the schooner, father, and I came&#xD;
to save you. But, father, where is"-and Kate placed her lips- close&#xD;
to her father's ear, as she whispered the word-"Stanly."&#xD;
"I had hoped to meet him here," replied her father, " but I fear that&#xD;
he has been either taken prisoner or--"&#xD;
" O, no ! do not say that dreadful word, father, interrupted Kate;&#xD;
" I cannot--" but she was cut-short in her speech by the discharge&#xD;
of a score of muskets, in the hands of a party of British soldiers, who&#xD;
had been sent down to prevent the escape of the fugitives.&#xD;
There was no time to be lost, and the few patriots who had gained-&#xD;
the beach leaped into the boats which were pulled off to the yacht,&#xD;
where Letts immediately relieved Kate in her command, and the little&#xD;
vessel was kept hovering-along the shore, just beyond'the reach of mus-&#xD;
ketry, until past midnight, when she was squared away up the river for&#xD;
French Creek, as all on board had determined to have nothing more to&#xD;
do with the Ogdensburg army of invasion.&#xD;

now Stanly Alwyn, remember-and his friend Steve Marvell.&#xD;
Soon after leaving the mill, Stanly was seized upon by three British&#xD;
soldiers, who, less bloody minded than most of their companions, only&#xD;
stripped him of his borrowed red-coat, and without permitting him te&#xD;
resume his own, pinioned his arms and marched him off to the town,&#xD;
where he was thrust into 'a guard-house along with some thirty other&#xD;
prisoners, among whom he almost immediately recognized Steve Mar-&#xD;
vell and the boy Charles Gillet, the latter having been slightly wounded&#xD;
and .his clothes nearly torn oft, in his desperate struggle with his&#xD;
captors.&#xD;
-iCHAPTER       XXIL&#xD;
A PRISON eCENE-A MYSTERIOlUS VISITOR-FRIENDS IN SCARLET--Tan&#xD;
LIBERATION.&#xD;
LrrrILE more than a mile from the city of Kingston, are a number of&#xD;
strong stone buildings with iron doors and barred windows, inclosed by&#xD;
an immense wall, full six feet in thickness and fifteen in height.&#xD;
These -buildings had been originally intended for naval workshops,&#xD;
stores, &amp;amp;c., but since the first outbreak-of the rebellion, they had been&#xD;
.used as prisons ; and now more than four hundred prisoners were, con-&#xD;
fined within their cold, granite walls.&#xD;
Men and boys, taken at various points along the frontier, had been&#xD;
seat here for trial. Van Sholtz and many other officers had been&#xD;
strangled with British halters, many more sentenced to death, and more&#xD;
than two hundred were doomed to transportation to the British penal&#xD;
colonies for life.&#xD;
'In a dark, gloomy apartment, whose bare walls of hewn limestone&#xD;
were almost entirely covered with grotesque pictures, and rude draw-&#xD;
ings of ships, an l battle scenes done in charcoal, are confined three of&#xD;
the wind-mill prisoners. They have had their trial, and will be sent as&#xD;
slaves for life to the far off Austrian colonies.&#xD;
The chamber where these three persons are confined is a great dark&#xD;
apartment, more than twenty feet square, dimly lighted by a single&#xD;
window. They are all heavily ironed, hand and foot, and now one of&#xD;
the prisoners stands close up to that narrow chink, called a'window,&#xD;
gazing out at some distant object, and thrusting his face close up into&#xD;
the chink, as if every half-inch gained in that -direction was a matter&#xD;
(f the utmost importance.&#xD;
For five long minutes he remains there in- breathless silence, and&#xD;
perceives, more than two miles away, over towards Long Island, a&#xD;
beautiful little craft gliding gracefully along to the westward, under the&#xD;
influence of a gentle breeze, which all the morning has,,been blowing&#xD;
from the northward.&#xD;
"Steve,' he exclaims, in an agitated voice-and as the light streams&#xD;
through the narrow ercevice, you recognize: the prisoner as our hero,&#xD;

&#xD;
Stanly Alwyn. "Steve, come here, quick !" and one of his companions,&#xD;
as fast as his manacled limbs -will permit, shuffles' along to the window.&#xD;
"Look over there towards.the inland, Steve, and tell me if that craft&#xD;
is' not-'. ;-."&#xD;
" The yacht, by heaven! !and as I am a live sailor in double irons, I&#xD;
can almost -make out Capt. Ben himself. Hurrah ! for liberty and&#xD;
Yankee land!   Never say.die! and if we don't work Doff of this lee&#xD;
shore, Steve Marvell's a horse marine."&#xD;
The third prisoner, aroused by Steve's boisterous exclamations, now&#xD;
comes forward, and as he approaches the light, we know him as the boy&#xD;
hero of the wind-mills, the crippled "buckeye" boy, Charles Gillet;&#xD;
The three prisoners now alternately gaze out at the little schooner&#xD;
until she disappears behind an elevation of the intervening promontory ;&#xD;
and then they wonder what the Bravo's plans are ; for that he is in&#xD;
command of the yacht, and that her appearance there has some refer-&#xD;
ence to themselves, they do not for a moment'doubt.&#xD;
Their conference is soon interrupted by the clang of bars and bolts,&#xD;
and the next moment their prison door swings open, and a prison&#xD;
official enters, followed by two females, dressed in black and wearing&#xD;
heavy veils, which entirely conceal their features.&#xD;
:.  ere is a moment of silence, which is broken by the voice of the&#xD;
fficial, saying--&#xD;
"Stephen iarvell, your mother has obtained permission to visit you,&#xD;
aend bring a bundle of clothing for yourself and companions."&#xD;
" Mother--" Stephen, my son !"; are the quick and simultaneous&#xD;
exclamations of Steve and the taller of the two .females, and in a mo-&#xD;
ment the mother of the noble sailor springs forward, clasps him in her&#xD;
,arms, strains: him to- her -maternal bosom, and weeps tears of bitter&#xD;
anguish, as her eyes rest upon his fettered limbs.&#xD;
" Charley Gillet," again speaks the official "your sister-"&#xD;
A sudden exclamation-of surprise from the boy interrupts him-&#xD;
"My sister ! I have---"&#xD;
But he, too,.is interrupted by the second female, who bounds forward,&#xD;
flings her arms about the boy's neck, and bending her lips close to his&#xD;
ear, whispers, in a low but earnest tone, a single word--&#xD;
"0Caution !"&#xD;
Some ten minutes having elapsed, the examination of the- various&#xD;
articles is completed, and the Widow Marvell proceeds to distribute&#xD;
them among the three prisoners. As Steve takes a pair of boots from&#xD;
his mother's hands, she points significantly to the thick, double soles,&#xD;
and-a peculiar meaning smile, which lights up Steves countenance for&#xD;
a moment, tells that his mother is understood.&#xD;
The official gives the- visitors -notice that it is time to depart, and&#xD;
quick as thought, as he turns his face towards the door, thb sister of&#xD;
the cripple boy darts to the side of Stanly, lays her hand upon his arm,&#xD;
whispers a single brief sentence in his ear, and the next moment she is&#xD;
gone..                        :  -       .&#xD;
" Courage, dear Stanly ; you shall soon be free I"&#xD;
They are fiut a few words, of plain ordinary speech, but there was a&#xD;
magic in'them that made the heart of the young captive bound, and&#xD;
at the blood tingling through his veins like fire.&#xD;

4 Courage, dear Stanly!" There was but one woman in all the wide&#xD;
world who would speak thus to him ; and had not his ear recognized&#xD;
the well-remembered tones of that sweet musical voice, his own heart&#xD;
would have told him who that woman.was.&#xD;
The prison door is immediately secured, and as the official pauses to&#xD;
converse with a soldier on duty, the two females reeline against the&#xD;
door; and while apparently engaged in earnest conversation, the one&#xD;
whom we know only as the sister of the boy, appears to be busy with&#xD;
her hands behind her person, endeavoring to adjust her shawl, or seenre&#xD;
a book of her dress.&#xD;
" Is it right now ?" she inquired, turning her back, with her haids&#xD;
still behind her, towards her companion.&#xD;
"Yes, that will do," replies the widow, stooping down apparently to&#xD;
examine the shawl, dress, or hook,-but in reality to look at a most per-&#xD;
feet impression in wax of the key-hole to the lock.&#xD;
For a few moments longer the soldier keeps the official engaged, and&#xD;
the females pass hastily along the corridor to the main entrance, where&#xD;
they pause by the open door, and the mysterious shawl-arranging or&#xD;
dress-hooking is repeated, and then, as if drawing their veils down over&#xD;
their faces had been a pre-concerted signal to the soldier, he shoulders&#xD;
his musket and turns on his heel, leaving the official, who hastens to,&#xD;
attend the two ladies to a carriage which is waiting for then. outside&#xD;
the prison walls.&#xD;
Scarcely had the door closed upon the prisoners, when Steve Marvell&#xD;
caught u~p one of the boots brought him by his mother, and seizing the&#xD;
outer sole in his teeth, he tore it off, disclosing within a cavity neatly&#xD;
packed full of small flat files, numerous tiny saws manufactured from&#xD;
watch springs, and a variety of other instruments,- sufficient to have&#xD;
separated "Her Majesty's' iron fron the limbs of every prisoner in&#xD;
Canada.&#xD;
In the cavity of one of Stanly's boots he found a small note from&#xD;
Letts, which read as follows:&#xD;
" Keep good courage, my friends, and you shall soon be at liberty.&#xD;
Secrete the instruments which you find in the boot, and do not use them&#xD;
- tillyou hear from we again, which will be through a sentry who mounts&#xD;
guard on the ramparts.                            BEN LETTS."&#xD;
Stanly thrust the note into his mouth when he had finished reading&#xD;
it; and at the moment he did so, the light which came in through the&#xD;
little window was suddenly darkened, a scarlet arm was thrust in through&#xD;
the chink, a paper fell upon the floor, the arm was withdrawn, and the&#xD;
British soldier oa the rampart resumed his measured tread as though&#xD;
the musket had never left his shoulder.&#xD;
Stanly picked up the paper, and as he unfolded it, -a second note,&#xD;
directed to himself, met his eye. The first was from Letts, and reed&#xD;
thus:&#xD;
" DEAR STANLY--To-morrow night I shall have the yacht in waiting&#xD;
at Cedar Point. I will meet you at midnight at the prison, and escort&#xD;
you on board. All needful instructions will be communicated by our&#xD;
mutual friend, Sergeant McCullough, of the Royal 61st.&#xD;
Yours,    BEN LETrS."&#xD;

The second-note was dated, and appeared to have been but just writ-&#xD;
ten. It was as follows:&#xD;
"cOAPT. STANLY  oi s--Oommence tomorrow evening, all of you,&#xD;
and remove your irons as fast as possible. The' soldier who is now on&#xD;
guard on the outer wall, will furnish you with candles to work by,,and&#xD;

Fort Edward, April 28, '39.'&#xD;
As they were not much acquainted with the use of the tools which&#xD;
they had just received, they concluded to practice awhile on their fet-&#xD;
ters at once ; and it was decided that they would cut their rivets almost&#xD;
through, and then they could finish the job much more readily than if&#xD;
they had it all to do in a moment..&#xD;
Fifteen minutes"labor satisfied them that they could free themselves&#xD;
in half an hour, and they proceeded to secrete and remove everything&#xD;
that might tend to arouse the suspicion of the provost, who would visit&#xD;
their prison when their dinner was brought in.&#xD;
Scarcely had the outer gate of the prison closed for the night on the&#xD;
evening of the 29th of April, when the soldier on the rampart thrust a&#xD;
dozen candles, a box of matches, and a small bottle of sweet oil through&#xD;
the window, to facilitate the iion-sawing operation. Within the pack-&#xD;
age was also another note from Sergeant McOullough, in which he&#xD;
informed them that the keys were in the hands of the soldier who was&#xD;
to mount guard in the corridor at ten o'clock, and that everything was&#xD;
quiet in the garrison:&#xD;
In-less than half an hour their limbs were free from' the load of iron&#xD;
which had so long weighed them down, and then, with beating hearts,&#xD;
they impatiently awaited the midnight hour.&#xD;
It came at last, and just as the last faint.notes of " Twelve o'clock,&#xD;
and a-l-'s w-e-l-1l!" was borne to their ears, a cautious tread sounded&#xD;
along the corridor, the massive door swung back upon its hinges, and a&#xD;
British soldier beckoned them to come forth.&#xD;
They were not slow to obey the summons. and as they crossed the&#xD;
threshold, they were met by Ben Letts, the Bravo, who, as soon as the&#xD;
door was closed and re-locked, drew one of his pasteboard cards from&#xD;
his bosom,. which he affixed to the wall, and then in silence the little&#xD;
party left the prison.&#xD;
In the yard they were met by Sergeant McCullough and seven more&#xD;
of."'Her Majesty's" most un-loyal subjects, who preferred serving them-&#xD;
selyes in a free country, or even serving'- Uncle Sam," to playing slave&#xD;
in a scarlet coat all their lives at seven-pence per day ; and as they had&#xD;
all carried their muskets so long that. they almost seemed a part and&#xD;
portion of themselves, they determined to carry the matter still further&#xD;
and the mnuskets-they carried them off altogether.&#xD;
With the utmost cautiqa they pursued their way across the rugged&#xD;
peninsula,, and within twenty minutes from  the time they left the&#xD;
prison, 'they were all safely on board the yacht which was at once got&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
THE, ISLAND' FORTRESS-TRE EXPEDITION--BURNING OF THE SIR ROBERT&#xD;
PEEL---KATE, THE HEROINE-WORKING A TRAVERSE.&#xD;
DIRECTLY in the fair way between French Creek and the town of&#xD;
Ganannoque, on the Canadian side, and nearly in the centre of the St.&#xD;
e Lawrence, is a little rocky islet, rising almost perpendicular on all sides&#xD;
to an immense height,.presenting the singular appearance of a huge&#xD;
monumental shaft, wrought by the hand of Nature, and planted there&#xD;
-like a grim sentinel, on the outskirts of the " Thousand Islands"&#xD;
The -summit of this rock is crowned with a dense growth of low&#xD;
stunted pines, and is inaccessible at all points, save on-the southwestern&#xD;
side, where there is a narrow, winding path that leads from the water&#xD;
to the summit.&#xD;
This Martin Vas of the St. Lawrence is known as Grindstone Island-&#xD;
and here, in the spring of 1838,-it is known that the famous Smnuglei&#xD;
of French Creek took refuge and defied the united powers of Great&#xD;
Britain and the United States.&#xD;
Some three weeks previous to the liberation of the three prisoners,&#xD;
" Old Bill," assisted by Letts and a few other desperate characters,&#xD;
captured and burned a British schooner, in the river St. Lawrence.-&#xD;
unluckily, it happened in the American-waters--and the United States&#xD;
marshal had arrived at French Creek with an order from Washington&#xD;
for his arrest. But he escaped in one of his boats to Grindstone Island,&#xD;
which, in anticipation of such an event, he had fortified with two can.&#xD;
nons that they dragged up to the top of the rock with tackles, and&#xD;
there, with some twenty of his friends, he was besieged by two armed&#xD;
steamers, one American and the other English.&#xD;
Old Bill, however, gave himself little uneiminess on account of this&#xD;
combined blockade, for he could defend that precipitous path with his&#xD;
two guns against the whole force of England and America combined.&#xD;
Nevertheless, he regretted being penned up there, inasmuch as it had&#xD;
been arranged that he should take command of an expedition to burn&#xD;
one of the Royol Mail steamers plying on the lakes and- River St.&#xD;
Lawrence, as an ast of retaliation for the destruction of the Caroline ;&#xD;
and now that he was shut up there on the land, he feared that the&#xD;
project would be abandoned or postponed.&#xD;
Sfe Was mistaken in his surmise, for on "the very evening after the&#xD;
return of the yacht, as, some twenty-five persons who had "sword in"&#xD;
as members of the secret cutting out expedition were discussing the&#xD;
matter at the home of the smuggler, the 'motion was put to vote, and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7541-00000053"/>&#xD;
104&#xD;
&#xD;
THE EMPfESS OF.- THE ISLES; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
carried almost unanimously, that the expedition 'should be 'given up&#xD;
until Old Bill was out of trouble and could go with therm as ther com-&#xD;
mander. But for once democracy was powerless, and a minority tri-&#xD;
umphed.; for Kate walked deliberately into the midst of the company,&#xD;
and with as much queenly dignity 'as ever the haughty Joanna of&#xD;
Naples assumed, thus addressed the astonished group:&#xD;
" Gentlemen, you may deem me bold and unmaidenly, but many of&#xD;
you know me to be a smuggler's daughter-more familiar with rough,&#xD;
out-door life, than I am with the fashionable accomplishments of a&#xD;
modern boarding-school Miss.            '.  -&#xD;
" I know my father has set his heart upon destroying that steamer.&#xD;
le said she should be burned on her next passage down the river ;&#xD;
that will be the day after to-morrow--and burned she shall be, if Kate&#xD;
Johnson lives, and five of you dare accompany her."&#xD;
Ere the last words had passed her lips, the cripple boy, Charles&#xD;
Gillet, bounded to her side, and drawing his slight figure up to its full&#xD;
height, he looked fiercely around for a moment, and then turning to&#xD;
Kate, said-&#xD;
" May I go with you?"&#xD;
She took the boy's hand, and a sweet smile wreathed her lips; but-&#xD;
before she could speak, Steve Marvell shied his tarpaulin into the mid-&#xD;
dle of the floor, and springing -to the side of the boy, he shouted-&#xD;
" Hurrah for Kate Johnson ! Excuse me, Miss Kate ; but put me&#xD;
down for your bow oarsman, if you please, and d-n me if I don''pull&#xD;
an oar wherever you dare to steer her, if it's through the brimstone lake&#xD;
itself, in chase of old Commodore Beelzebub."&#xD;
While Steve was speaking, Stanly and Letts came forward and stood&#xD;
there with folded arms and looks that spoke their determination to&#xD;
accompany the brave girl when and wherever she chose to direct.&#xD;
They had been silent before, because they were 'not of the "sworn"&#xD;
party ; and they were silent now, because their resolve was taken, and&#xD;
they had nothing to say. They were ready for action.&#xD;
Whenthe sailor ceased to speak, there was a pause for perhaps ten&#xD;
seconds, and so profound was the silence, that each one heard as well as&#xD;
felt the beating of his own heart."&#xD;
Then there was a long-drawn hissing respiration, as if all had been&#xD;
holding their breath, and the next moment there burst forth simultane-&#xD;
ously from all, three as lusty cheers " for Kate Johnson" as ever went&#xD;
up from human throats.S&#xD;
Twenty-four hours after this scene occurred, a stout barge, manned&#xD;
by thirty-six determined fellows, each armed with a brace of pistols and&#xD;
a heavy dragoon cutlass, shot out into the strong current of the St.&#xD;
Lawrence from behind Washington Island, and darted away like a&#xD;
swift bird down the river.S&#xD;
Had it. been daylight, she would have presented a most strange pic-&#xD;
ture, guided as she was By a girl not more than eighteen years old, and&#xD;
armed like the others-perhaps for murderI&#xD;
Some thirty miles below lrench Creek, the navigable channel of the&#xD;
St., Lawrence is contracted into a narrow, intricate passage, in some&#xD;
places not more than three hundred yards in width, through which the&#xD;
current rushes with great velocity.  -&#xD;
&#xD;
T"hE LAKE BRAVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
'O.&#xD;
&#xD;
This little strait, bounded on the east by a chain of bare ledges and&#xD;
small rugged islets, and on the west by a long narrow island, rising to&#xD;
a -considerable height, and covered with woods, is called the " Lower&#xD;
Narrows."&#xD;
Just' about midway of this island is a wood-landing, where a few of&#xD;
'the larger steamers were in the habit of stopping to replenish their&#xD;
stock of fuel; and here, at sundown, on the evening after that barge,&#xD;
filled with armed men, left Fiench Creek, a noble steamer, the Sip&#xD;
ROBERT PEEL, 'one Qf the " royal mail line" on Lake Ontario, hauled is&#xD;
alongside the rocks to wood.&#xD;
Three quarters of an hour went by, and the shades of night were fast&#xD;
gathering around the steamer; the party of soldiers on board had&#xD;
stacked their muskets, aind leaving a single sentry on deck, were quietly&#xD;
taking their supper. -A bugler on the promenade deck was blowing&#xD;
away at" 3Britania rules the waves," as earnestly as though he really&#xD;
believed it; the hands were earnestly engaged in taking in wood, an&#xD;
-no sound gave warning of approaching danger, when, sudden as the&#xD;
bound of a couched leopard, from the opposite side of the narrow chau-&#xD;
nel darted that barge, black with hostile men and bristling with steel.&#xD;
On she came, like the swoop of the monster seaeagles, and ere the&#xD;
klarnm could be sounded and the  itish soldiers gain their muskets;&#xD;
thirty-six men, armed for destrucE ion and led on by that girl com-&#xD;
mander, stood upon the steamer's deck.&#xD;
" Over board with the lobsters' muskets !" shouted Steve Marvell&#xD;
and ere you could count ten, the muskets were flung over the side into&#xD;
the river.                                               -&#xD;
The captain would have resisted, but the gleam of twenty sabres awed&#xD;
the few who cared to fight, and within five minutes the steamer was in&#xD;
possessian of the " avengers" without a blow having been struck, or a&#xD;
single shot fired.&#xD;
It was' very unlike that scene of midnight murder, when the ill-fated&#xD;
Caroline was destroyed.&#xD;
Fore and aft the word was passed for everybody belonging the&#xD;
steamer to leave her ; and in less than twenty niinutes, all, save the&#xD;
commander, stood on the shore. He still remained standing in the&#xD;
.gangway, inquiring of the young heroine who stood beside him with one&#xD;
hand laid upon the butt of a pistol in her belt-" And, what do you&#xD;
intend-to do with the steamer ?"&#xD;
Kate smiled as she pointed significantypto a man coming aft with a&#xD;
blazing fire-brand; and then, with a clear, ringing tone, that was distinctly&#xD;
heard by all on the shore, she said                           y&#xD;
"REMEMBER THE CAROLINE !"&#xD;
" All ashore !" shouted the Bravo, at this moment, in a voice like a&#xD;
speaking trumpet. - -&#xD;
" Cut away your fasts there, fore and aft, bawjed Steve Marvell; and&#xD;
with a cry 'of despair and rage, the English captain leaped ashore, as&#xD;
he saw a score of cutlasses hacking away at. the stout hawsers that&#xD;
secured the steamer to the rocks.&#xD;
The engines were set in motion; off from the shore swung the boat,&#xD;
to the-centre of the narrow passage, when' the wheels were stopped, both&#xD;
anchors let go, and thirty men with brands of fire were hurrying to and&#xD;

fro in the hold, on deck, and in the gorgeous cabins, while Kate and&#xD;
Stanly, Letts and the crippled boy, stood there on the gangway in&#xD;
silence, and smiled as they saw their busy -comrades applying the torch,&#xD;
and lighting up the flames to avenge the destruction of the 'Caroline.&#xD;
At length, when a hundred fires had been so thoroughly lighted that&#xD;
no human agency could save her, the party left the steamer, and pull-&#xD;
ing their barge off a few hundred yards, they lay on their oars and&#xD;
watched her, till the fire burst out in p e -sheet of flame, fore and aft,&#xD;
when they gave three cheers for " Kate Johnson," and settling back to&#xD;
their oars, they sent the barge through the water like an arrow, in the&#xD;
direction of French Creek, leaving Her Majesty's Royal Mail Steamer,&#xD;
Sin ROBERT PEEL, to her fate.&#xD;
The news of this act of open piracy went like wild-fire, and a reward&#xD;
of five hundred dollars each had been offered by the President for all&#xD;
concerned in the outrage, together with a thousand for the commander,&#xD;
and a like sum for the smuggler chief, who was still penned up on&#xD;
Grindstone Island ; and twenty United State smarshals were on the&#xD;
alert to make the arrest and win the promised reward.&#xD;
One beautiful afternoon, about ten days after the affair happened, as&#xD;
Kate was pulling over to her father's island fortress, with a six-oared&#xD;
barge, loaded with provisions for the little garrison, she was intercepted&#xD;
when about a mile from the island, by an American steamer, with a&#xD;
marshal on board, who directed the captain to run down for the barge,&#xD;
so that he might arrest the " female pirate."&#xD;
Bill Johnson and his family had no warmer friend than the captain&#xD;
of that steamer, and he would have gladly passed on without noticing&#xD;
the barge ; but the pompous marshal was very positive-and so, reluc-,&#xD;
tantly, the captain bore down for the barge.&#xD;
Kate saw the impossibility of escape, and so ordered her little crew&#xD;
to cease rowing.&#xD;
In five minutes the barge was within an oar's length of the steamer's&#xD;
quarter, and the marshal leaning over the rail, began to summon&#xD;
Miss Kate in particular, and her crew generally, to give themselves up.&#xD;
"By the authority, and in the name of-----"&#xD;
The next instant the heroic officer dodged down behind the bulwarks,&#xD;
while the captain and three or four others who had gathered near,.&#xD;
burst into a roar of laughter.'&#xD;
There, in the barge alongside, stood six determined looking fellows,&#xD;
each with his oar poised on end, and presenting the muzzles of six very&#xD;
ominous looking dragoon pistols towards the spot from whence the&#xD;
valiant mashal had just disappeared.&#xD;
In the stern sheets stood Kate, with one tiny foot resting lightly upon&#xD;
the guniyale of the boat, while*in one hand she displayed the British&#xD;
flag captured from the Peel, and in the other a pistol, which, like her&#xD;
crew, she pointed towards the steamer.&#xD;
For ten, twenty seconds, they stood there in silence, and then the&#xD;
captain of the steamer removed his hat, and bowed politely to the&#xD;
beautiful girl, who returned the courtesy, and resumed her seat; and&#xD;
as the barge-shot ahead of the steamer, and the quick dip of oars grew&#xD;
faint in the distance, the brave marshal left his hiding-place behind the&#xD;
bulwarks,-and in a trembling voice inquired if they were goneI&#xD;
&#xD;
TH E LAKE BRAVO,101&#xD;
" Shall I run her alongside of'emn again ?" inquired the captain.&#xD;
".0, for God's sake, no!" screamed the marshal, " don't go near 'em&#xD;
again, or that little fire-cat, with her six pirates, will kill and burn us&#xD;
all up together, as they did the Peel.&#xD;
" Let her go, and if government wants her and her desperate crew,&#xD;
they may come and get them. I'll have nothing more to do with it."&#xD;
Nearly all of those who had been concerned in the burning of the&#xD;
Peel, had taken refuge on the island with Old Bill; but as it was&#xD;
utterly impossible that they could hold out there for any great length&#xD;
of time, some forty of them, among whom were the old smuggler him-&#xD;
self, Stanly, Steve and Kate, surrendered to a single United- States&#xD;
marshal, who removed them from the island to the smuggler's home at'&#xD;
French Creek, there to await instructions from .the Supreme Court.&#xD;
.The marshal who secured the prisoners and the rewards, amounting&#xD;
in all to some twenty-two thousand dollars, was "Bill Johnson, Jr.,"&#xD;
the eldest son of the smuggler.&#xD;
This manoeuvre was what the saliors denominated "a regular Tom&#xD;
Cox's traverse ;" and it was a grand speculation for some of the pris-&#xD;
oners, whose pockets had not been blessed with a dollar for many a day.&#xD;
-f&#xD;
CHAPTER     XXIV.&#xD;
A JUDICIAL FARCE-THE BRAVO REDEEMS HIS OATH MADE OVER THE&#xD;
MURDERED DURFEE.&#xD;
MosT fortunate for Bill Johnson and his associates was it, that at&#xD;
the very time of their arrest by Bill Jr., a blustering Canadian named&#xD;
Alexander McLeod, a perfect vagabond bragadocio, who, by his own&#xD;
avowal-had been one of the party of British marauders who destroyed&#xD;
the Caroline, had been caught on the American side, arrested, and after&#xD;
a vain attempt to organize a court- and empannel a jury, either at Lock-&#xD;
port or Batavia, in whose presence it would be safe to trust him, he&#xD;
was at last removed to Onedia county, under the protection of a de-&#xD;
tachment of United States troops, and was then undergoing his trial at&#xD;
Whitesboro for that act of piracy.&#xD;
Although it was proved beyond a doubt that the(braggart was not&#xD;
within fifty miles of the Niagara frontier on the night that the Caroline&#xD;
-was burned, yet so great was the indignatin against him for even&#xD;
boasting that he had been one of that murderous band, that had he&#xD;
not been constantly protected by a strong military force, it is more than&#xD;
probable that lie could not have lived to cost the United States some&#xD;
seventeen thousand dollars for the expense of a trial, standing armies&#xD;
to protect him until he sailed for England, pocket money, travelling&#xD;
expenses, &amp;amp;c. Why, theft women ;would have thrashed him to death&#xD;
with their broom-handles and mop-sticks, or the -boys would have&#xD;
bean his brains out with brick-bats, if it were only to show the world&#xD;
in general, and the British government in particular, that they could&#xD;
feel, and dared resent the shameful act of piracy, if their government&#xD;
did not.&#xD;

THE EMPRESS OF, THE ISLES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Under circumstances like these, it is not very strange that when the&#xD;
old Smuggler of the St. Lawrence, and his associates, made their appear-&#xD;
ance before the Supreme Court -in Albany, they were everywhere-and&#xD;
by everybody looked upon as heroes'who had achieved a glorious action,&#xD;
rather than a band of lawless brigands, who had been guilty of an&#xD;
atrocity not a whit less than that of the British pirates at Selosher, only&#xD;
that they had not committed murder.  =&#xD;
Strangers as they were, they were treated with a hospitality' that&#xD;
perfectly astonished them.. During their stay'in Albany, lawyers of&#xD;
the highest eminence volunteered their services; -hotels were thrown&#xD;
open to them, men of the highest respectabilityy offered to sign their&#xD;
bail bonds, and if the. amount had been fixed at. a million dollars, it&#xD;
would have been made up in less than twenty-four hours.-&#xD;
Kate was an object of especial interest, and was hailed by all with&#xD;
acclamations and huzzas quite as enthusiastic as any that ever greeted&#xD;
Kossuth after he landed upon our shores.&#xD;
A truO bill was found by the grand jury against Bill Johnson, and&#xD;
some ten of the others, for burning the British schooner. and against&#xD;
the remainder for the capture and destruction of the Sin ROBERT&#xD;
PEEL.&#xD;
Ten days went by-the Supreme Court was in session, and the&#xD;
prisoners were ready for trial, when suddenly it was discovered by the&#xD;
Chief Justice, Attorney General, counsel for the defense, jury, and&#xD;
everybody else, that these'acts were committed without the jurisdiction&#xD;
of the United .States, and the Court was incompetent to try the pris-'&#xD;
oners.&#xD;
Of course a nolle prosequi was entered, the accused set at liberty, and&#xD;
it was almost as necessary to surround them with a military guard to&#xD;
keep the people from killing them with kindness, as it had been to pro--&#xD;
tect-McLoed from the popular fury. -&#xD;
Another week spent among the hospitable Albanians, and then the&#xD;
old smuggler, with his daughter, and accompanied by Stanly and Steve&#xD;
Marvell, left for home, while the others of the party dispersed in various&#xD;
directions to seek out new adventures and squander the prize money&#xD;
which they had received for their own capture.&#xD;
Charles Gillet, the cripple boy, became a student at-law, and is now&#xD;
one of the most eminent lawyers in the State of Ohio; so very popular&#xD;
is he with the people of that State, that they have already bestowed&#xD;
upon him some of the highest offices in their gift.&#xD;
One of the company who assisted in the destruction of the Peel,&#xD;
had not been arrested. This was Ben Letts. Immediately after the&#xD;
party returned to French Creek, he presented Kate with his beautiful&#xD;
yacht, saying it was the only recompense he bad it' in hispower to&#xD;
make for all the care and trouble his.unfortunate sister must necessarily&#xD;
make her; and then, after taking- an affectionate leave of his friends,&#xD;
he departed for the West, to fulfil some of the promises he had made&#xD;
to Heaven and his friends in Canada. -&#xD;
It-was a calm summer's night in the month of June, about the time&#xD;
that the party of "avengers" arrived at Albany, that an hour perhaps&#xD;
past midnight, a solitary individual passed across the wooden bridge&#xD;
&#xD;
Tit LAKE RAV.               1 409&#xD;
&#xD;
that.spans the Welland River in the village of Chippeway, and with a&#xD;
cautious, noiseless tread, took his-way along the street which led to the&#xD;
northern part of the town.&#xD;
After he had passed on- for nearly a quarter of a mile, he slakened&#xD;
his pace, and' appeared to be-examining the houses as though he was a&#xD;
stronger in the neighborhood, and sought some particular building that&#xD;
should answer a description which he-had inhis mind.&#xD;
At last he seemed to have found the one he was in search of,. bit as&#xD;
.f to assure himself beyond a doubt, he crept along like a cat till he was&#xD;
=elose up to the door, and then,-after a moment, the'pale blue flame-of a&#xD;
natch, which he held up to the door plate, was reflected back from the&#xD;
Polished metal,..and revealed-or might .have done ,so, had any one&#xD;
been present to see them--the features of BEN LETTS, THE LAXI&#xD;
B AVO.-t.&#xD;
By the faint glimmer of that match he read: the name of Captain&#xD;
Hugh Fitzgerald, engravp.d on the silver plate. The next moment his&#xD;
hand was upon the bel-pull, and a peal was rung that must have&#xD;
instantly awakened those within; for scarce half a minute went by, ere&#xD;
a man in his night-clothes appeared at the door, and demanded the&#xD;
stranger's business.&#xD;
"Is your name Fitzgerald ?" inquired the Bravo.&#xD;
"It is," replied the Canadian captain.&#xD;
"You commanded the expedition that destroyed the piratical steamer&#xD;
CI did ; and killed two of the d- d Yankees with my own hand.&#xD;
Our Sovereign Lady the Queen has knighted McNab, who did nothing&#xD;
for that affair, while I-"&#xD;
He.did not finish the -sentence, for a gripe like that of an iron vice&#xD;
was upon his throat. Therewas a. loud report of a pistol, and when&#xD;
the neighbors, aroused by the noise and the screams of the female&#xD;
inmates-of the house, hastened to the. spot, they beheld the dead&#xD;
body of Captain Fitzgerald, lying across the threshold, and his brains&#xD;
spattered on the door and walls, while at the silver knob hung a paste-&#xD;
board card, bearing the ominous words-" BEN LETTs, THE BRAVO."&#xD;

by the hand of Kate Johnson herself there in the artistically-laid-putl&#xD;
cottage grounds, the superb parterre with its delicate array of f-owers,&#xD;
the fields of luxuriant clover, the three or four giant old trees, stand-&#xD;
ing out alone as the eternal guardians of the little islet,.and the dark&#xD;
woods beyond, are all out in their brightest, most splendid holiday&#xD;
garb. Oh, it is a most lovely spot, is this little gem of the St. Law-&#xD;
rence-Linda's Island; and I love to linger here, to return to it often,&#xD;
and dwell upon, its almost sylvan beauties.&#xD;
,  Once more we -stand beneath the venerable old willow, beside the&#xD;
grave of Linda Morris. Not the lone,:solitary grave that we have bean&#xD;
wontto gaze upon in times gone by, for now there is a newer mound,.o&#xD;
close to it that a beautiful rose-bush which grows up between them,&#xD;
spreads its branches, now laden with a profusion of blushing flowers,over&#xD;
both graves. At the head of the new-made grave stands a chaste marble&#xD;
slab, upon which we read-&#xD;
&#xD;
STANLY ALWYN,&#xD;
EARL AND MARQUIs oF DaLHOUsIE,&#xD;
KILLED&#xD;
AT PRESCOT, JANUARY13th, 1839,&#xD;
.E1D 47 YEARS.&#xD;
Erected by his friend,'&#xD;
WM. JOHNSON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yon know, as you read that simple epitaph and the name of the noble&#xD;
old smuggler in the margin, that William Johnson has redeemed the&#xD;
promise he made in the old wind-mill that winter afternoon, as he held&#xD;
the dead body-of the Hermit in his armsS j" As for myself, if Iescape at&#xD;
al, I shall carry him with me !"&#xD;
By the generous bravery, and more than woman's kindness of the&#xD;
rough old smuggler, the Hermit of the Genesee, Earl of Dalhourse,&#xD;
husband of Linda  Morris, and father of Stanly Alwyn, has found a&#xD;
grave beside his wronged wife, from whom he had been so painflly&#xD;
separated, and who, by the accursed wiles of a vile wretch, had been&#xD;
crushed like a frost-blighted flower in the very spring-time of her&#xD;
existence.   f&#xD;
Two forms are kneeling there at the head of the two graves under&#xD;
the old willow. Both are dressed in deep mourning. You understand,&#xD;
without beholding their faces, that these two mourners are Stanly&#xD;
Alwyn, our hero, and the beautiful Kate Johnson, our heroine.&#xD;
" Come, dear Kate"-the young man speaks after more than fifteen&#xD;
minutes of profound silence--"come, Kate, let us return to the cot-&#xD;
tage. Our friends will, I fear, grow impatient at our long delay."&#xD;
And raising the kneeling maiden from the ground, the young man&#xD;
imprints a kiss upon her velvet cheek, and arm in arm the sad, yet&#xD;
happy lovers take their way, along the path which leads from the two&#xD;
graves 'to the cottage.&#xD;
We will follow them, if you please. I am at home here, and I pro-&#xD;
mise you we shall not intrude. Come, let us enter the cottage along&#xD;
with the lovers.&#xD;
&#xD;
You are astonished, almost bewildered, as.you enter the elegant&#xD;
parlor of this beautiful island cottage. ~Everything is new and in such&#xD;
perfect harmony, blending richness of material with a chaste style, and&#xD;
durability with ornamental construction, that you feel it was no com-&#xD;
mon order of female genius which had superintended the purchase of&#xD;
these things, and the interior arrangement of the cottage.&#xD;
You are right-the mind and genius of Kate Johnson is of no com-&#xD;
mon order ; and yet'it seems almost incredible that a young girl, born&#xD;
and reared in that wild, out-of-the-way region, and who had never seen&#xD;
a town in her whole life larger than the little village in which she was&#xD;
born, until her recent visit to Albany, could have displayed such admi-&#xD;
rable taste in fitting up this beautiful Eden home.&#xD;
.But there is a group of persons assembled here in this cottage parlor&#xD;
that claims our attention. The faces of all are familiar, and you will&#xD;
require no introduction. ° No, there are two persons present who are&#xD;
strangers to us. I did not notice them at first. One of these we have&#xD;
seen once before, but it was in the dim, uncertain light of a gloomy&#xD;
prison ; besides, she wore a heavy black vel, that almost entirely co-&#xD;
cealed her features.&#xD;
You will guess In a moment-who it is: the mother of our sailor friend,&#xD;
Steve Marvell. We have a better view of her here than we had there&#xD;
in the Canadian prison, where the dim light that struggled: in through&#xD;
that narrow chink, served only to render the darkness apparent; and we&#xD;
can say that she is a good-looking old lady, perhaps fifty years of age,&#xD;
with hair unstreaked by a single thread of gray, and frank, expressive&#xD;
features, very nearly resembling those of her son.&#xD;
The other stranger is a tall, handsome, well-dressed man,.perhaps&#xD;
forty-five, and seems far more familiar with armies and military parades&#xD;
than with law, gospel, or the peaceable pursuits of agriculture.&#xD;
You are not mistaken. He is an officer of high rank in the army of&#xD;
the United States. I am sorry that I cannot introduce him by his&#xD;
proper name. It would be a breach of confidence, and I dare not do&#xD;
it. Suffice it, then, that he was a general in the army of the United.&#xD;
States, and I will call him Gen. Wo---. No, that is too near his real&#xD;
name. Whitney, then--Gen. Whitney, U. S. Army. But we will leave&#xD;
him, and glance at the other persons present.&#xD;
There on the sofa, beside the widow Marvell, is seated the beautiful&#xD;
Edith, with an open book in her hand, which is all unheeded, while she&#xD;
converses in a low tone with- her companion. The bloom of health&#xD;
again mantles her damask cheek, and every mark of insanity has left&#xD;
-her features, except now and then a quick and restive glance of her&#xD;
blue liquid eyes, tells that the lurking demon makes his home in her&#xD;
bran&#xD;
Near the door through which they have just entered the apartment,&#xD;
stands the lovers, Stanly and Kate ; by the centre-table is seated Steve&#xD;
Marvell, abstractedly turning over aportfolio of splendid marine draw.&#xD;
ings; while the last figure in the tableau vivant is the herculean old&#xD;
Smuggler himself, standing there within arms length of Gen. Whitney,&#xD;
and apparently absorbed in the contents of a letter.which the general&#xD;
hasgiven him to read.&#xD;
" We are all prepared here at the Creek," says the Smuggler, as.h.&#xD;

12           THE EMPRESS OF T'Er ISLES ; OR,&#xD;
refolds the "letter and return' it to Gen. Whitney. " Yes, we are all&#xD;
ready here, General. I was notaware that you were the fist to propose&#xD;
this, fete-, till now."&#xD;
"Nor was I," replies the general .  More than twenty of my friends&#xD;
spoke of it to me while you-and your daughter were in Albany. I&#xD;
have been the most active perhaps in making the necessary prepara-&#xD;
tions ; but, in confidence, the, Governor of the Empire State was the first&#xD;
person that proposed it in any definite fora. - He, like the majority of'&#xD;
the. people, is indignant at the imbecile course pursued by our Govern-&#xD;
ment with regard to the Caroline 'outrage, and proposes this fete for&#xD;
the three-fold .purpose of doing honor to your brave girl, showing our&#xD;
contempt of the narrow minded, servile policy pursued by the United&#xD;
States. Government, and telling that of Great Britain that the people&#xD;
of the State of, New York dared to show their abhorrence of such acts&#xD;
of'attocity as that of the Sloscher massacre,-and dared'to bid defiance&#xD;
to 4Her Majesty's'"red-coated legions in the'most emphatic terms.&#xD;
"And now, as the fete is to-come-off to-morrow, it behooves us to be&#xD;
moving ;=and at your earliest convenience, we will all return to Clay-&#xD;
ton."-&#xD;
We are all ready, sir," replied Stanly; and, in less than twenty&#xD;
minutes-exactly in the'spot where we first made, the acquaintance of&#xD;
our hero as 'he laided from the-steamer more than two years ago--the&#xD;
party all embark on board 'the yacht and she is-standing over towards&#xD;
Clayton ; 'and as it is long past noon, and to-morrow we shall be called&#xD;
to witness one of the most exciting scenes ever enacted on the Canadian&#xD;
frontier, we will bid the yacht and her company adieu, and rest, as all&#xD;
novel writers and-readers do, somewhere till morning.&#xD;
THE CORONATION.                 .&#xD;
It is the hour of sunrise, and a day.more gorgeously 'lovely never&#xD;
dawned upon the world. Not a single cloud'specks the blue arch of&#xD;
heaven,; the vast current of the' majestic St. Lawrence goes sweeping&#xD;
en as unruffled and quiet as the calm sleep of a rocked infant ; the&#xD;
tops of the lofty old pines sway lazily to and}'fro, just stirred by the&#xD;
gentle western breeze, and the air, perfumed by the odor of fields and&#xD;
flowers, is vocal with the matin song of ten thousand feathered song-&#xD;
sters.&#xD;
Midway of Well's Island in the lower Narrows, in sight of the British&#xD;
garrison at Brockville, on the very spot where thecrew and passengers&#xD;
of the Peel had landed.at the time-of her-capture, is assembled, on this&#xD;
beautiful summer morning, a vast concourse of people-more than five&#xD;
thousand you would. say, as your eye wanders over that sea of human&#xD;
heads, extending from the water far back into the dim recesses of the&#xD;
rocky,, pine-clad island.&#xD;
More than thirty sail of vessel, mostly beautiful schooners, and one&#xD;
noble steamer, are moored along the rocks ; and as the bright, warm sun&#xD;
rolls up above the dark, old woods on the American side of the river-.&#xD;
away aloft to mast heads and gaff ends, on board the moored fleet, go&#xD;
banners and streamers, and beautiful motto flags;' and from a hundred&#xD;
tall pines on the island blows, in the gentle breeze, the glorious banner&#xD;
of;the stare.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE -LAKE BRAVO.                     113    '&#xD;
"In the name of all that's wonderful, what does all this mean V' you&#xD;
inquire.&#xD;
There is no time for an explanation, for the crowd that line the rocky&#xD;
cliffs there, abreast of the clipper-looking brigantine, fall suddenly back&#xD;
from theshore, and disclose a splendid battery of cannon, and the next&#xD;
moment =these beautiful guns begin to speak. in- thunder tones their&#xD;
"good morning," to the assembled multitude.&#xD;
One after another, in quick succession, they belch forth their sheets&#xD;
of flame, till young havecounted twenty-seven, and then you know that it&#xD;
is a round national salute.&#xD;
But the occasion--I-but hark ! An answering gun-look there-&#xD;
yonder above the Narrows, some four miles away, just where those three&#xD;
little green islets almost block up the river and shut out all the view&#xD;
beyond !&#xD;
Just bursting on the vision, through that narrow channel, comes&#xD;
dashing on a magnificent steamer, her decks black with human beings,&#xD;
all her flags and gorgeous banners waving free, music paig and her&#xD;
cannon thunderingobacktheir deafening response to or battery here&#xD;
"What does it all mean ?"&#xD;
Softly, my friends: let us watch every movement, and it is strange&#xD;
if we don't find out. But see! as the steamer rounds to, and heads in&#xD;
towards the rocks, we behold there on her upper deck, near the pilot&#xD;
house, several persons whom we recognize in a moment.&#xD;
There is Gen. Whitney, and the giant form of Bill Johnson. Stanly&#xD;
and Steve Marvell are- standing there near 'the- smuggler; and there&#xD;
are nearly a dozen others whom we know, but it is scarcely prudentere&#xD;
speak their names here. They are all men holding some of the highest&#xD;
offices in the State. They are here "incog," and we will not stare&#xD;
thrm out ot countenance.&#xD;
But there, a few steps in advance of these gentlemen strangers, is a&#xD;
group'that challenges our utmost admiration.&#xD;
Thirty maidens, perhaps-all dressed in spotless white, bare-headed,&#xD;
and their brows encircled by wreaths twined of laurel and roses, with&#xD;
features that would rival the houries of an eastern Paradise-present a&#xD;
galaxy of beauty that the whole frontier from Michigan to the St. Law-&#xD;
rence cannot equal.&#xD;
In thecentre of the group stands a glorious creature, so trancendently&#xD;
lovely that she exceeds in magic charms even the beautiful creatures&#xD;
about her, as far as the bright noon-day sun does the dim stars seen&#xD;
through the midst of night, in splendor. I&#xD;
She is clothed -in a robe of rich azure satin, with a mantle of gor-&#xD;
geous purple velvet, lined with rose-colored silk, trimmed with ermine&#xD;
and elaborately embroidered with gold,-while on her superb arms, bare&#xD;
to the elbow, she wears, as you obseve, massive bracelets, flashing with&#xD;
jewels that fling back the sunlight in ten thousand reflections.&#xD;
Her head, like those by whom she is surrounded, is bare, but instead&#xD;
of a green laurel wreath, she wears a tiara of virgin silver, with olive&#xD;
and laurel leaves of purest gold, and at the stem of each there gleams&#xD;
in the bright, warm sunlight, a sparkling diamond.&#xD;
We all recognize her: little need is there for any one to tell us that&#xD;

it is our heroine-Kate Johnson-that creature of superhuman beauty&#xD;
there on the steamer's deck.&#xD;
But look there again !&#xD;
General Whitney advances a few steps, waves his hand and bares&#xD;
his head, A broad banner of lustrous satin is run aloft to a flag-staff&#xD;
at the steamer's bows, and now, as:its -ample folds float out on the&#xD;
breeze, we behold embroidered on it, in natural colors, a burning steamer&#xD;
and a gallant barge filled with armed men, and guided by a magnificent&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
There is a moment's silence as that significant emblazonry of the&#xD;
banner meets the gaze of the assembled thousands, and then hate,&#xD;
scarfs, and snowy handkerchiefs are waved enthusiastically-and, as&#xD;
from the lips of one man, there goes up a wild, thrilling shout of exulta-&#xD;
tion. Another, and another, in quick succession, gaining in strength and&#xD;
volume at each hurrah, till they wake the far-off echoes and startle the&#xD;
frightened eagle in his'distant eyrie..&#xD;
On the instant that the last shout leaves the lips of the screaming&#xD;
multitude, the roar of cannon from the rock battery again peals forth,&#xD;
like the dread thunder of Heaven's artillery.&#xD;
Flash follows flash, and peal on peal the brazen-throated guns bellow&#xD;
forth their welcome, till a royal salute, equal to that which greets the&#xD;
Sovereign of England, has been fired,; and then, as the huge steamer&#xD;
swings into her berth alongside the rocks, the royal cortege of the&#xD;
young native Princess of the St. Lawrence comes forth with all the.&#xD;
pomp and splendor of a regal pageant._&#xD;
First comes Gen. Whitney as Grand Marshal and master of the&#xD;
ceremonies, next two heralds, followed by a body of thirty stout men&#xD;
at arms, and then the young Princess with her attendants, after which&#xD;
come her family and personal friends, and last of all, a long procession&#xD;
of gallant looking men and beautiful women, who have come hither to&#xD;
assist at the first coronation known to history in North America-may&#xD;
it be the last History will record on this division of the Western&#xD;
World.&#xD;
Two hours of busy preparations have passed, and we behold on the&#xD;
bare, rugged rock, directly in the rear of the battery, a splendid throne&#xD;
erected ; andnow the death-like silence is broken by the blast of many&#xD;
trumpets; and when the brazen clangor is stilled, the heralds in a loud&#xD;
voice proclaim Catherine the 1st ag QUEEN of the Thousand Islands !&#xD;
Another storm of applause follows this announcement, and then, with&#xD;
all the solemnity and ceremony practiced at a European coronation,&#xD;
Kate Johnson, the Smuggler's daughter, heroine of the St. Lawrence,&#xD;
is anointed EMPRESS oFr' THE ISLES, under the title of Queen Cathe-&#xD;

Another whirlwind of enthusiasm, another royal salute, and the first&#xD;

An hour more is spent in the selection and appointment of the offi-&#xD;

the festivities 1f .the day commence.,&#xD;
A'dozen stewards are appropriated, and a magnificent collation being&#xD;

shouts of her loyal subjects, departs for Clayton, leaving more than four&#xD;
thousand queen-makers on the island, who are determined to keep up&#xD;
the festivities throughout the night.&#xD;
At a lats hour in the evening the young Queen arrives at the&#xD;
smuggler's home, where she dismisses her attendants, lays aside her&#xD;
dignity and royal robes together, and embraces her mother, who had&#xD;
remained at home, and seats herself beside Stanly, once more the blush-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
THE COAST GUARD-DESTRUCTION OF THE MONUMENT--CONSTERNATION&#xD;
AND INDIGNATION-BURNING OFF A CANAL--THE TORPEDO--TERROR-&#xD;
THE SILENT WARNING.&#xD;
The news of Capt. Fitzgerald's murder was conveyed with the utmost&#xD;
despatch to all the frontier towns in Canada, and caused more excite-&#xD;
ment than anything that had occured since the Ogdensburgh crusade&#xD;
and the battle of the wind-mills.&#xD;
Everybody was familiar with the dreadful oath of vengeance uttered&#xD;
by young Letts thire in the Court House in Kingston on the day of&#xD;
his trial; but full two years had gone.since his last incendiary act had&#xD;
been committed, and people generally, if they ever thought o the mat-&#xD;
ter at all, Bame to the conclusion that Ben Letts was dead or that his&#xD;
utmost vengeance was satisfied.&#xD;
But when the startling intelligence of this most deliberate murder,&#xD;
and the Bravo's open avowal of the deed, was bruited abroad, the&#xD;
utmost excitement prevailed, and the police, as well as the military,&#xD;
were immediately on the alert to arrest the assassin.&#xD;
At all the ports from which any vessels sailed, extra troops were&#xD;
stationed, guards were placed on board of all vessels in the harbors,&#xD;
and every precaution was taken to prevent the Bravo's escape from&#xD;
Canada; and as he was outlawed, so that any man might shoot 'him&#xD;
down with impunity, and a reward of two thousand pounds was offered&#xD;
for his head, it seemed altogether impossible that he could long elude&#xD;
the vigilance of these in pursuit.&#xD;
Ten days went by, during which not a single trace of the murderer&#xD;
had been discovered, when another outrage was committed that caused&#xD;
a universal feeling of horror at its cold-blooded, heartless atrocity, not&#xD;
only throughout the British Provinces, but wherever it was heard in&#xD;
the United States.&#xD;
On Queenstown heights, at the distance of seven miles below Niagara&#xD;
Falls, and on the very spot where Gen. Sir Isaac Brock was killed,&#xD;
was erected 'a magnificent column of massive granite masonry to his&#xD;
memory.&#xD;

THE EXFPRESS OF THE ISLES; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
ever wore the British uniform. - A ripe scholar, a universal philanthro.&#xD;
'pist, and an accomplished gentleman, every body loved him while living,&#xD;
oand when dead, thousands who had never seen him, revered his mem-&#xD;
ery-and the spontaneous gratitude of the Canadian people built him&#xD;
that splendid monument.&#xD;
It was a calm starlight evening, near the hour of ten, that four sol-&#xD;
iera of ~the coast guard, having seated themselves on tlieoruins of a&#xD;
redoubt on Queenstown Heights, not half a mile from the monument'&#xD;
which arose - between them and the clear blue sky, its arrowy shaft&#xD;
pointing towards Heaven, were conversing of the dead hero whose vi-&#xD;
tues and many acts of heroism were commemorated by the giant column,&#xD;
and engraved on the marble tablets embedded in its walls.&#xD;
On the other side of the monument, at about the same distance, a&#xD;
party consisting of four ladies, two of whom were lineal descendants of&#xD;
the illustrious Brock, two British. officers in their brilliant scarlet&#xD;
uniform, and a venerable, gray-haired, old man, who stood beside Sir&#xD;
Isaac Brock when he fell, were assembled on the porch of a farmhouse&#xD;
which commanded a view of the monument, upon whose dim outlines&#xD;
their eyes were fixed as they discoursed of the renowned warrior.&#xD;
At the open'windows of a hotel in the village of Queenstown, a party&#xD;
of American ladies and gentlemen, arrived that evening from Buffalo,&#xD;
were conversing of the many interesting reminiscences connected with&#xD;
the,"heights" upon which they were gazing, and which on the morrow&#xD;
they intended to visit.-&#xD;
All at once, as they gazed upon the monumental column--the four&#xD;
soldiers on the old redoubt-the little company assembled on the rustic&#xD;
porch of the farmhouse-.the party of Americans there at the windows&#xD;
of the hotel--quick as the lightning's flash, there was a crash, a roar,&#xD;
and for a moment Niagara itself was hushed by the awful explosion, and&#xD;
then all was still. When they looked again, the stately shaft was shorn&#xD;
of half its towering height, and the summit of what remained, showed&#xD;
rough and jagged against the calm summer sky.&#xD;
Forth from the hotel, from fifty houses in the village of Queenstown,&#xD;
from the farmhouses in the neighborhood, and the military barracks,&#xD;
rushed men, women, children, and half stupefied, wondering soldiers-&#xD;
all struggling and panting up the rugged heights towards the scene of&#xD;
the explosion.&#xD;
Vain were all attempts to paint the looks of astonishment and hor-&#xD;
ror depicted on-the faces of all, as group after group, and singly,.nervous&#xD;
and out of breath, they gained the height, and stood there speechless,&#xD;
amid the wide-scattered fragments of the ruined monument.&#xD;
Thenthere burst forth a whirlwind of maledictions, and cries of rage,&#xD;
mingled with flerce threats of speedy vengeance, as a soldier bearing a&#xD;
lantern, approached the crowd, and held up a piece of white pasteboard,&#xD;
which he had found suspended to a tree near the monument, and which&#xD;
bore, in flaming capitals of fiery red, the words-&#xD;
"BEN LETS, THE BRAVO."&#xD;
Consternation and indignation, before unbounded, now became terror&#xD;
and rage superlative. All felt that so long as the terrible Bravo was&#xD;
at large in their midst, there was noisecuritigfor-life or property. This&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE LAKE BRAVO        -   ,J&#xD;
last atrocity spoke in language that carried conviction to the hearts of&#xD;
all, that Ben Letts dared tq do anything; and before morning's dawn,&#xD;
five hundred men, who had before taken no interest in his capture,&#xD;
joined the chase, and swore to hunt the miscreant to the death:&#xD;
The reward for his apprehension had been doubled, and the hue and&#xD;
cry went on with unremitting zeal, when the intelligence of a .new atro-&#xD;
city, committed by the desperado, ran like wild-fire along the fra4tger.&#xD;
It was nothing less than burning of the Welland Canal.&#xD;
Some fifteen miles from Lake Erie, the canal which connects the&#xD;
two lakes is carried across the Welland River in a vast structure, 9f&#xD;
sufficient capacity to admit the largest vessels navigating the: canal.,&#xD;
About midnight, a week after the monument was blown up, this im-&#xD;
mense frame-work of massive pine timber, forming a perfect web-work&#xD;
of posts and braces, joists and huge girders extending from shore to&#xD;
shore, was discovered to be on fire in a dozen plaes.,&#xD;
In less than one hour, with a crash like that of an earthquake, more&#xD;
than two hundred feet in the middle of the acqeuduct instantly gave&#xD;
way,-pouring from either side of the broken space, the whole volume&#xD;
of water contained in the burned off canal, down two artificial cascades.&#xD;
The damage done by this daring act of incendiarism was incalculable,.&#xD;
Those who had witnessed the destruction of the'acqueduct were about&#xD;
to retire, when, the faint gleam of some white object on the walls of a&#xD;
deserted hut that stdod near the western extremity of the structure,&#xD;
caught=the eyes of several of the party ; and on a closerinspection, it&#xD;
proved to be another of the Bravo's cards. Where ten men had before-&#xD;
been engaged in the .ravo hunt, there were now a hundred, each and&#xD;
all of whom had sworn his death.&#xD;
Ten days longer, and there came a thrilling rumor from Toronto,&#xD;
of another act committed by the Bravo, in that city, more fiendish in&#xD;
its nature than anything he had yet accomplished.&#xD;
A beautiful armed schooner in the harbor had been blown up by a&#xD;
torpedo, with a tremendous explosion that hurled a hundred human be-&#xD;
ings to destruction, and nothing remained save a few shattered spars-&#xD;
and, fastened to one of the buoys near where the schooner had been an&#xD;
chored, another of those dreadful cards, bearing the name of-&#xD;
f"-BEN LETTS, THE BRAVO."&#xD;
Not the most remote clue to the secret hiding place of the reckless&#xD;
outlaw could be found ; and that light, ten thousand men and women&#xD;
trembled in abject terror, lest the next fell swoop of the demon Bravo&#xD;
should crush themselves.&#xD;
One of these had just cause to tremble. It was the lawyer-spy,&#xD;
Oliver Shephard, whom we have so long lost sight of.&#xD;
He was in Toronto at the time, and that evening, as he returned to&#xD;
his room after a short walk, he found a sealed note upon his table, and&#xD;
hastily breaking it open, he read-&#xD;
"Vile wretch!   You are marked as the next victim of the BRAvo's&#xD;
vengeance I"&#xD;
Quivering with terror, as though the assassin's knife was already at&#xD;
his throat, Oliver Shephard left the hotel with all his luggage, and in&#xD;
less than half an hour he was on board a steamer bound for Rochester.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
THB LAWYER'S CONFIDANT--A DAY AT HOCHESTER--THE ACCoMPLCE-.,&#xD;
ABDUCTION OF THE SPY-A NIGHT AT THE CAVE,&#xD;
I an'ALf adhere to Ohaucer'ss rule as nearly as possible, and tell this&#xD;
portion of my story as it Was told to me.&#xD;
There were but few passengers on board the steamer in which Oliver&#xD;
Shephard took passage,-and as it was a beautiful evening, and the water&#xD;
perfectly smooth, most of these had assembled on the upper deck, where&#xD;
sociability and good humor prevailed, each one seeming intent on en-&#xD;
enjoying himself, and contributing to the general fund of amusement.&#xD;
Oliver Shephard had remained for more than- an hour, seated apart&#xD;
from the others, without passing a word with any person, but all the&#xD;
time closely observing a very genteel and very fashionably-dressed&#xD;
young man, who appeared to know everybody, and something of every-&#xD;
thing. The very first moment that Shephard's eyes rested, upon the&#xD;
handsome, careless young stranger, his heart warmed towards him--if&#xD;
a thing so cold and stony as his vile heart could warm-and he felt that'&#xD;
of all others he- was the very person he would choose for a confidant.&#xD;
The mysterious infatuation grew stronger upon -him, until at length,.&#xD;
when nearly all the passengers had retired for the night, he approached&#xD;
the stranger, and sought to engage him in conversation-.&#xD;
" Nay, you flatter me, sir," replied the young man, stepping back and&#xD;
bowing to the lawyer as gracefully as another Chesterfield ; " never-&#xD;
theless, I feel myself highly honored by your compliment."&#xD;
" Good evening, sir," said' the lawyer, extending his hand, which the&#xD;
other shook cordially. "I have never in my life," continued Shephard,&#xD;
"felt so very much interested in the conversatioir of any person, as I&#xD;
have by your remarks this evening.'7&#xD;
a I had not intended my remarks as a mere compliment,,sir ; on the&#xD;
- contrary, I never was in more real 'earnest in my life," rejoined Shep-&#xD;
hard ; " and if you are not disposed to retire, might I be gratified with&#xD;
the honor of your company for an hour or so longer ?'&#xD;
"I am at your service, sir, and if my wild, rattle-brained conversation&#xD;
can interest you, I shall be most 'happy of your companionship during&#xD;
the whole night if you choose, for I have not the least disposition sleep.&#xD;
" But I am a much better listener than talker, sir, and s "all be&#xD;
delighted to learn many things of which I am ignorant, from y urself."&#xD;
" How well I have judged him-what an admirable confidant," said&#xD;
the lawyer mentally, as he again grasped the young stranger's hand.&#xD;
" May I be permitted to know the name of my new acquaintance?"&#xD;
asked Shephard, in his blandest tone.-'&#xD;
".Most assuredly,"- replied the young man, promptly.  " It is but&#xD;
just that aequaintances should know each other. 1 apn a southerner ;&#xD;
but that I need scarcely tell you, since my very appearance speaks my&#xD;
origin. You may perhaps have heard of Senator Berrian, of Georgia ?"&#xD;
" I have met him twice in my life," said Shephard, eagerly. "And so&#xD;
you are a son of the distinguished senator?  I might have known it&#xD;
without asking a question. I think you greatly resemble your parent.&#xD;
"Many persons have told me that I-am the picture of what my father&#xD;
&#xD;
was at my age. Buat I trust I may be permitted to know more defi-&#xD;
nitely the---"&#xD;
" Ah, excuse me, Mr. Berrian," interrupted Shephard ;" I had for-&#xD;
gotten myself. My name is Oliver Shephard, a member of the Mid-&#xD;
land District Bar. I have been several times to Washington on business&#xD;
connected with the government, and it was there I met your father."&#xD;
-The young stranger whom Oliver Shephard has thus unwittingly&#xD;
introduced to himself and us at the same time, was a young man per-&#xD;
haps twenty-five year old, rather below the medium stature, but well&#xD;
formed, and possessed, as the lawyer thought, the handsomest features&#xD;
he had ever seen. His skin was very dark, and his hair, whiskers, and&#xD;
glossy-moustache, told of his birth-place in a genial clime.&#xD;
This young southerner, to whom the lawyer had taken so sudden and&#xD;
strange a fancy, appeared to be equally prepossessed-towards the Cana-&#xD;
dian lawyer ; for twelve-one-two o'clock went by, and they still were&#xD;
there upon deck, engaged in seemingly a most confidental conversation.&#xD;
I will, give the substance of the important part of Oliver Shephard's&#xD;
confidential communications to his young friend.&#xD;
He commenced with the part he had acted, in bringing about the&#xD;
unfortunate separation between the young Earl of Dalhousie and his&#xD;
beautiful wife ; although the fact that at that time he -had borne the&#xD;
name of Richard Delamere, he did not 'disclose.&#xD;
Then he went on in detail, giving the particulars of his connection&#xD;
with Col. Moody, up to the time that Shephard left the colonel in the&#xD;
little garden, meditating the -death of his vile accomplice in crime.&#xD;
He then related the circumstances of his having been disappointed in&#xD;
his search after Edith Letts-of two unsuccessful attempts that Col.&#xD;
Moody had procured to be made to assassinate him--and how he had&#xD;
at length extorted from the colonel twenty thousand pounds which had&#xD;
once been the property of Benjamin Letts, and which he had with him&#xD;
on board the boat, all in good English gold ; and finally, he told how&#xD;
he had been frightened that evening by the Bravo's terrible threat, and&#xD;
had left Canada in great haste, to avoid the desperado's vengeance.&#xD;
When he had communicated everything, he paused a few moments,&#xD;
and then inquired of his- companion what course he would advise him to&#xD;
pursue, and if he thought it prudent for him to remain at Rochester?&#xD;
Unhesitatingly, the warm-hearted young southerner replied-&#xD;
"Come'with me, sir, to my home in the sunny south. You will be&#xD;
delighted with the country and the people ; and I assure you, you&#xD;
shall be right welcome among us. As for your remaining in Rochester,&#xD;
I consider it imprudent in the extreme. If this Letts is the desperate&#xD;
character that he is represented to be, there will be no safety in re-&#xD;
maining within five hundred miles of the Canadian frontiers. I shall&#xD;
be detained in Rochester a short time on business, and then together&#xD;
we will depart, if you will, for my home."&#xD;
Perhaps the young man did not know what a wretch he was inviting&#xD;
to his southern home, and yet you would think that he should have&#xD;
known, after listening to the villain's story. But then Oliver Shephard&#xD;
had only-shown one side of the mirror.&#xD;
With many thanks on the part of the lawyer, at a late hour they&#xD;
retired to their berths.&#xD;

12           THE EMPRESS OF TIE. ISLES; OR,&#xD;
It was scarcely sunrise when the steamer reached her wharf, some&#xD;
four miles below Rochester, and in less than an hour thereafter, Oliver&#xD;
Shpphard and his young southern. friend had entered their names at&#xD;
one of the first hotels in the city.&#xD;
After breakfast, they took a stroll together through the town, and&#xD;
then, as they drew near the hotel, after two hours' ramble, young Ber-&#xD;
rian took leave of his compapion, saying he had some business which&#xD;
would occupy him through the d.y, but promised to meet his friend&#xD;
again at an early hour in the evening.&#xD;
Berrian turned into a narrow, obscure;street, which he traversed with&#xD;
rapid 'strides for more than a quarter of a mile, until he came to a low,&#xD;
shabby-looking old building, which, from the uncouth characters over&#xD;
its entrance, purported to be a grocery and liquor store. He entered,&#xD;
and within three gninutes was engaged in writing a note, at a small&#xD;
desk in the'back part of the room, while a stout,-repulsive-looking man,&#xD;
with huge black whiskers and black flashing eyes, stood near him, with&#xD;
outstretched hand, as if waiting for the written paper.-&#xD;
"1Oliver Shephard, Eagle Hotel," read the black-whiskered stranger,&#xD;
as he took .the sealed note from Berrian. "Very well, sir, he shall&#xD;
have this within ten minutes. My boy here is acquainted with one of&#xD;
the waiters, and five dollars to each of them will keep their mouths&#xD;
close, so no one will know where this comes from."&#xD;
The note was put into the hands of a small boy, with full instructions&#xD;
for its delivery, and then a low, earnest conversation took place be-&#xD;
tween Berrian and his companion, only the latter portion of which was&#xD;
loud enough to be overheard--&#xD;
"Now, remember, Kit, the carriage is to be at the door at nine."&#xD;
#        "Ay, ay, sir," replies Kit, or, as we may as well know him at once-&#xD;
Christopher Caswell, one of the St. Lawrence prisoners, who had been&#xD;
set at liberty at Albany only about two months before.&#xD;
" Ay, ay, I shall be on the box with the driver, and we will be there&#xD;
to a minute.&#xD;
"And, Kit, be sure now to have our two fellows, Jake and Reub, on&#xD;
the spot by dark. Remember, if we fail, you lose your two thousand'&#xD;
dollars, and the others their one thousand each."&#xD;
"Never fear, Cap'n, the boys'll be there by sundown, and I'll be at&#xD;
the door precisely at nine. There's no such thing as fail."&#xD;
"Well, good day, Kit."&#xD;
Good day Cap'n ;" and the young southerner, Mr. Berrian, whom&#xD;
we begin to suspect is somebody else, left the apartment.&#xD;
"1My God ! Mr. Berrian, look at this.1" almost screamed Oliver&#xD;
Shephard, as he met his friend in the hall, on his return to the hotel&#xD;
about sundown. "Tell me, what shall I do7  He is here I" And the&#xD;
frightened, wretched man thrust a note into Berrian's hand, informing&#xD;
him, at the same time, that he had received it within twenty minutes&#xD;
after he returned to the hotel, and he had been waiting in agony all&#xD;
day for -him to return.&#xD;
Berrian-unfolded the crushed note, and read-&#xD;
"So, Oliver Shephard, you thought to baffle me, by leaving Toronto 7&#xD;
Ha! iia! ha !   Vile, d--d villain, the -avenger is on your track !&#xD;
Your hour'approaches. Escape you cannot.        BEN LETTS."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE.LAKE BRAVOS                       121&#xD;
For full five minutes after he had read the note, Berrian stood there&#xD;
in silence, and then, as if a-sudden idea had entered his brain, he said :&#xD;
" I'l tell you, my friend, I have an acquaintance about five miles out&#xD;
of the city, at whose house you will be safe. Now, you- settle our bill&#xD;
and remak carelessly, as you do so, that we start for Auburn to-night&#xD;
in a private carriage. That will put the desperado off the track, you&#xD;
see ; and in the mean time I'll step into a livery stable and order a&#xD;
carriage to be at the door at nine o'clock.",&#xD;
Berrian left the hotel, and Shephard, after having paid their bill,&#xD;
retired to his room and locked himself in, to await his friend's return.&#xD;
As the city bells tolled the hour of nine, a close carriage drove up&#xD;
to the door of-the Eagle Hotel, and in, five minutes the two friends,&#xD;
with all of Shephard's luggage, were on board, and away dashed the&#xD;
spirited horses toward the residence of Berrian's counrty friend.&#xD;
The northern limits of the city were soon left behind, and on rolled&#xD;
-the carriage, along down the western bank of the Genesee, till it came&#xD;
to a dark, gloomy place in the road about a mile below the falls, when&#xD;
ttie horses suddenly stopped, and the carriage door was wrenched open,&#xD;
when Berrian, seizing his coinpanidn by the throat, hurled him back-&#xD;
wards, with a giant's strength, through the open door, into the arms of&#xD;
three masked ruffians.&#xD;
" Quick! Kit, the gag and hood," he shouted, as he leaped out after&#xD;
his victim.&#xD;
" Ay, ay, Cap'n, we've got the stopper on. his jawing tackle. He&#xD;
won't pipe so loud as a dumb pig now."&#xD;
"Here, Rueb, you help Sam off, and down to the caveqwith the lug-&#xD;
gage--we three, the Cap'n, Jake and I, can manage the gentleman well&#xD;
enough. Or, Jake, you may as well help the boys, I'll make the d-d&#xD;
land-shark walk ; and if he undertakes to give me the slip, d-n me if&#xD;
I don't feel around his throat with this ere knife.- Come, travel, Mr.&#xD;
Shephard."&#xD;
Between Berrian and the stalwart Kit Caswell, each grasping an arm,&#xD;
the blindfolded and gagged captive was led frst down a winding intricate&#xD;
path, and then up another, until at length the whole party-Berrian&#xD;
and Kit with their prisoner, and the three other ruffians, each bearing&#xD;
a heavy trunk--stood on the little plateau in front of the Hermit's&#xD;
Cave there at Hanford's Landing.&#xD;
Kit Caswell produced a dark lantern and entered the cave, followed&#xD;
by the captive, who was closely followed by Berrian. Then the three&#xD;
men with the trunks went in, and ere three minutes were passed, they&#xD;
all stood within that lofty chamber, opce inhabited by the Hermit.&#xD;
The hood was removed from the prisoner's head, the gag from his&#xD;
mouth, and at the same moment Berrian removed his hat, tore away&#xD;
his brown, glossy wig, whiskers, and moustache, and the base miscreant,&#xD;
Oliver Shephard, stood there in the presence of his most deadly enemy&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE SUMMONS--THE HIDDEN CASKET-THE MAIDENS TALfSMAN-THE&#xD;
VEILED PICTURE-RETRIBUTION-A DEED OF HORROR.&#xD;
BuT a few days had passed since the grand coronation fete occurred,&#xD;
and preparations were being made at the house of Bill Johnson for the&#xD;
marriage of the young Empress of the Isles, to her long betrothed repub-&#xD;
lican consort, Stanly Alwyn.&#xD;
It was not yet sunrise on the morning before the day on which the&#xD;
ceremony was to take place, that a rough, sailor looking man arrived at&#xD;
the home of the smuggler, with a letter for Johnson himself, which the&#xD;
sailor informed him had been written on the day previous.&#xD;
Johnson broke the seal, and read as follows:&#xD;
DEAR SiR: If the wind is fresh and fair when you receive this, embark&#xD;
at once with your daughter Kate, my sister, Stanly, and Steve Marvell,&#xD;
for the Hermit's Cave. If the wind should not be favorable, take the&#xD;
steamer, which will be at Clayton about noon, on her way up from&#xD;
Ogdensburgh. But either way, come to the cave with all possible&#xD;
despatch.                                         BEN LETTS.&#xD;
The contents of the letter were communicated to the family, and after&#xD;
a moment's consultation, it was decided to postpone the marriage, and&#xD;
obey the somewhat mysterious summons immediately.&#xD;
Fortunately the wind was favorable, and within an hour after the&#xD;
letter was received, all the persons invited were on board the yacht.&#xD;
Early the following morning, she ranged up alongside the old wharf&#xD;
at Hanford's Landing, and her passengers, as they stepped ashore, were&#xD;
welcomed by the Bravo, who stood there on the wharf waiting to receive&#xD;
them; and soon the whole party stood in the grand chamber of the&#xD;
cave, which was brilliantly lighted up, and furnished exactly.as it had&#xD;
been during Edith's residence there, and she appeared delighted at once&#xD;
more visiting her old home. Kate was in raptures, and whispered to&#xD;
Stanly that she should be so happy to live there with him, away from&#xD;
the whole world. But she was suddenly interrupted by Letts.&#xD;
" I believe," he said, in a grave and measured tone, " that we are all&#xD;
acquainted with the circumstances attending the last moments 'of him&#xD;
who was formerly the occupant of this cave-I mean the Earl of Dal-&#xD;
housie. It would seem that he wished to communicate some important&#xD;
secret to his son, but the cold hand of death was upon him, and you, too,&#xD;
who kneeled with me beside him, will remember with what emphasis he&#xD;
ejaculated, in spasmodic sentences, his last dying words-'A secret-the&#xD;
cave-Edith-' and his voice was hushed for ever. And now, my sis-&#xD;
ter," the Bravo continued, $,will you show your friend---.  .&#xD;
" Ay, will I, my brother," exclaimed Edith eagerly, interrupting&#xD;
Letts ; and then taking one of the lamps from the table, she beckoned&#xD;
Stanly, Johnson, and her brother, to follow, and left the apartment.&#xD;
Without a moment's hesitation, she entered the little chamber which&#xD;
had formerly been used by the Hermit as his dormitory, and requesting&#xD;
her brother and Johnson to remove the heavy couch from the corner&#xD;
in which it stood, she knelt upon the rough, cold stones beneath where&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
-122&#xD;
&#xD;
the rude bedstead had been standing, and for two minutes appeared to&#xD;
be engaged in an earnest search for some object.&#xD;
Suddenly she sprang to her feet with a quick cry of joy, and stamped&#xD;
upon the rock where she had just been kneeling.&#xD;
But she seemed to be disappointed, for after having repeatedly&#xD;
stamped with her tiny feet on the craggy rocks, she caught the giant&#xD;
old smuggler by the arm, dragged him to the spot, and almost screamed&#xD;
to him to stamp.&#xD;
He obeyed ; and as his heel crushed down, almost withe the force of&#xD;
a sledge-hammer, up from out the floor of rough, solid masonry flew a&#xD;
great, massive, uncouth-looking rock, exposing a cavity wide enough to&#xD;
admit the passage of a man.&#xD;
Quick as thought Edith sprang down into the pit, lamp in hand, and&#xD;
called her brother and Johnson to follow., They obeyed ; and the&#xD;
next instant they stood'in a little apartment not more than eight feet&#xD;
- square, and in height barely sufficient to admit of the smuggler's stand-&#xD;
ing erect.&#xD;
On one side of the miniature cave there were placed against the wall&#xD;
three rough-looking boxes or chests, strongly bound with iron. Edith&#xD;
knelt before one of these chests, and drawing a key from her bosom, she&#xD;
unlocked it, and drew forth from amid 'parchments and papers, with&#xD;
which it was more than half filled, a casket of small wood, and hooped&#xD;
with silver. Then opening the other two chests, she exhibited to the&#xD;
astonished eyes of her brother and the smuggler, a vast quantity bf gold&#xD;
and silver coin, and a profusion of rich plate that might have vied with&#xD;
with that of Buckingham Palace itself.&#xD;
After a few moments, Edith re-locked the boxes, and taking up the&#xD;
casket, she left the cell, and with a cry of infantile satisfaction, she&#xD;
placed the treasure in the bands of Stanly Alwyn.&#xD;
Returned to the great chamber, Stanly placed the casket on the&#xD;
table, and receiving the key from Edith, he prepared to open it.--but&#xD;
before doing so, he addressed a few words to his companions.&#xD;
" My friends," said he, "you are all acquainted with as much of my&#xD;
history as I am myself informed of. And now, whatever revelations&#xD;
may be made by the opening of this box, belongs as much to my friends&#xD;
as to myself. From you I have no secret--come."&#xD;
They gathered around the table-the mysterious casket was unlocked.&#xD;
Within it were many papers, which being read, confirmed the dying&#xD;
words of the Hermit--that he was the rightful Earl of Dalhousie; and&#xD;
then there were the original letters patent, dated 1633, and under the&#xD;
seal and signature of Scotland's Sovereign, creating Stanly Alwyn, of&#xD;
Mid-Lothian, Earl and Marquis of Dalhousie, in the peerage of Scot-&#xD;
land.  There were-jewels of rare value, too; and last of all, Stanley&#xD;
drew forth the massive golden seal of the family, with the arms and&#xD;
crest of the Dalhousies engraved upon its emerald setting.&#xD;
After Stanley had read the last paper aloud, and deposited every&#xD;
thing in the casket as he had found it, Letts, without a word, withdrew&#xD;
from the chamber, and when he returned, after an absence of a few&#xD;
minutes, the whole group were struck dumb with wonder and surprise.&#xD;
Bound and closely guarded between two courageous men, they beheld:&#xD;

Linda's Island.--Steve Marvell, the disguised sailor whom he had met&#xD;
there at dusk in the cottage, grounds of that Eden home in Canada--&#xD;
Stanly Alwyn and Bill Johnson, the vile wretch on whose head they&#xD;
had sworn, as they kneeled there in the old wind-mill beside the dying&#xD;
Hermit, to wreak a most terrible vengeance-Edith Letts, upon the&#xD;
fiendish accomplice of her libertine betrayer.&#xD;
For five long minutes, Oiver Shephard stood there, cringing like a&#xD;
beaten cur, before that wondering group, when the chilly silence. was&#xD;
broken by a light bound of Edith, who flew to the mysterious -veiled&#xD;
picture hanging upon the wall, tore away the black screen, and there&#xD;
looked down upon the bewildered group a face of such angelic beauty&#xD;
that it seemed as though the Holy Mary herself, radiant with the bright&#xD;
halo of eternal glory, looked forth from the canvas and smiled a heavenly&#xD;
welcome to the enraptured gazers.&#xD;
"Linda, the Recluse 1" shouted the stalwart old Smuggler.&#xD;
' My mother I" exclaimed Stanly, as with outstretched arms he sprang&#xD;
forward and fell on his knees before the glorious picture.&#xD;
"The murdered victim of this d--d miscieant I" hissed the fierce&#xD;
Bravo, as with his clenched fist he struck the pale, trembling wretch in&#xD;
the face, and-dashed him to the earth.&#xD;
"Oh, God ! I thank thee !" spoke Edith Letts, as she clasped her&#xD;
forehead with both hands, and knelt before the unveiled picture.&#xD;
When Edith arose again, there were no longer any traces of the wild&#xD;
insanity in her eyes or features. The unveiling of that mysterious face,&#xD;
and the calm, holy features, had acted as a magic talisman. Edith-was&#xD;
free from her maniac thraldom.       -a&#xD;
Twenty-four hours later, the beautiful yacht sailed from the old land-&#xD;
ing, on her return .to Clayton, with all the party that had so recently&#xD;
left the smuggler's home in her, again on board..&#xD;
In the cabinwere to be seen the three rough iron-hooped boxes which&#xD;
we had a glimpse at'there in the subterranean cell, and a single glance,&#xD;
down into the schooner's hold will satisfy us that the cave has been&#xD;
stripped of all its furniture.&#xD;
Leaving .the gallant little craft to pursue her homeward course, let us-&#xD;
re-enter the cavern.&#xD;
As we gain the inner cave,.we behold it bare and desolate, dimly.&#xD;
illumined by a single lamp; that lamp is grasped by the terrible Lake&#xD;
Bravo} who scowls a horrid frown of wild, demoniac hate.&#xD;
"Vengeance! retribution !" he muttered, and then, with another&#xD;
fiendish glare around the vacant space, he strides from the chamber, and&#xD;
passes on through a narrow, tortuous way, which we have never trav-&#xD;
ersed; but we will follow him.       -&#xD;
He at length enters a monstrous arch, whose Cimmerian blackness is&#xD;
so intense, that the Bravo's lamp sheds only a faint halo about his&#xD;
head; and as we follow him within its chilling precincts, we hear the&#xD;
rushing sound of a subterranean torrent, which seems to be rushing&#xD;
around in a vast circular whirlpool, the brink of which is at our very&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
There is an articulate moan, a quick agonized exclamation, and the&#xD;
Bravo'stops--lowers-the lamp, and-.-&#xD;
Merciful God I Look there!               S&#xD;
&#xD;
124&#xD;
&#xD;
On the very edge of the black chasm lays a human being, stretched&#xD;
upon a heavy plank, with his legs and arms firmly secured to the tim-&#xD;
ber. It is-yes, as the Bravo holds the light to his face, We recognize&#xD;
the bound wretch: it is Oliver Shehhard&#xD;
But, 0 Heaven ! how changed rom the burly'ruffian or the hypo-&#xD;
critical villain that, under other circumstances, we have seen him.&#xD;
Bound there, upon that plank, he writhes his body ir the most dread-&#xD;
ful contortions, while his face-God, in mercy, spare us from ever look-&#xD;
ing upon another such a sight !&#xD;
You see his eyes glaring wildly, blod-shot, and protriiding from their&#xD;
sockets-; his features pinched and blue, as if Death had already. laicPhis&#xD;
cold, icy hand upon his victim; his tongue-in merey to your reason,&#xD;
look but once, lest the second glance drives you mad.&#xD;
His lips are drawn spasmodically back, displaying his teeth, now tinged&#xD;
with blood from his bitten tongue, to their very base. -&#xD;
Very calmly the Bravo places his lamp upon the ground, and then&#xD;
in silence he bends over his bound an helpless victih, with a grim, fero-&#xD;
cious smile upon his features.&#xD;
-  0, mercy ! mercy I Spare -me 0.O do not murder-kill-torture&#xD;
me in this dark, horrid place !" again pleads the frantic wretch, as if he-&#xD;
hoped still to move the Bravo'sobdurate heart to some feeling of pity.&#xD;
"  ! Benjamin Letts ; if you are human, if a heart that ever knew&#xD;
one spark of pity beats within your breast, do not kill me here! !Spare&#xD;
me, and I will give you gold-all-every-"&#xD;
" Ha ! ha ! ha !" rings out a wild peal of demoniac laughter.&#xD;
" Gold, Oliver Sheephaid ! 1 hate your gold already. But, you&#xD;
plead most eloquently. Pity it is that you bad not defended me on&#xD;
my trial at Kingston. I should not now be an outlaw--a desperate&#xD;
Bravo. Pity ! That word sounds oddly, coming from your lips, Oliver&#xD;
Shephard. Pity ! My gentle sister begged pity. Did she find it ?"&#xD;
As if it had been but a child's toy-that ponderous plank and its&#xD;
burden--the Bravo lifts it from the ground, and then, as a shrill scream,&#xD;
like the last despairing yell of the d---d, rings out in' the gloom, he&#xD;
hurls the shrieking wretch, with a giant's strength, down into the black&#xD;
abyss-from whence, for ten long minute', screams and frantic cries&#xD;
come ringing up, as the plank-borne victim goes whirling round, and&#xD;
then all is still, The Bravo's oath and Hermit's vengeance have been&#xD;
accomplished.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
THE BRAvo's MISTAKE-THE DOOM AND INCREDIBLE ESOAPE--THE LIB-&#xD;
ERTINE'S REWARD-&#xD;
A WEEK, or it may be ten days, not more than that, after that fearful&#xD;
tragedy was enacted there in -the cave, the Great Britain, one of the&#xD;
noblest steamers on Lake Ontario, was alongside of her wharf in the&#xD;
harbor of Oswego. It was a rainy, disagreeable afternoon, and few&#xD;
people were abroad in the storm, except those who had just arrived&#xD;
from  Kingston in the steamer, and other passengers who were. to&#xD;
embark her for Toronto.&#xD;

THE EMPRESS OF THE ISLES; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Cloaks, umbrellas and carriages seemed to be in special demand ;&#xD;
but there was one person who seemed careless of all these conveniencies,&#xD;
and came on board the boat, his clothes dripping with water, and a&#xD;
great hair-covered trunk on his, shoulder, which he deposited in a snug&#xD;
little place under the stairs leading to the upper deck ; and then, after&#xD;
shaking the " wet" from his garments like a genuine water-dog, he&#xD;
looked around among the fifty genteel passengers who were standing&#xD;
there in front of the ladies' cabin, as if in search of some familiar face&#xD;
whom he expected to meet.&#xD;
"1Who are you looking for, Pat ?" asked a red-faced, good-looking&#xD;
young man, with a sparkle of fun in his eyes, and a peculiar expression&#xD;
indicative of good humor and a love of good liquor.&#xD;
It was but little wonder that he addressed the new comer as " Pat,&#xD;
for a more perfect specimen of a recently-imported Limerick Irishman,&#xD;
no one ever saw.&#xD;
" More power to yer boner ; sure it's Misther Mac Griggor that I'd&#xD;
be afther findin-more betoken that he tould me there be zent I d'find&#xD;
him here sure."&#xD;
"Is Mr. MacGriggor your friend, Pat ?"&#xD;
" Woora; an bedad he is, God's grace till his soul ! Be the living&#xD;
powers, didn't he give me five an thirty shillens ? an aint I goin over&#xD;
till Torot-Tarum---Tar--bad cess till the crooked word intirely-but&#xD;
I can't spake the letthers at all."&#xD;
" Toronto, is it you mean ?"&#xD;
"Arrah, an be the awld wig av de grandfather's cat ! an it's that&#xD;
intirely, I'm goin over to wrought in the ditch-"&#xD;
Pat's attention was now arrested by a great, brawny, country-looking&#xD;
man, apparently more than half drunk, who came along, and happening&#xD;
to see the Irishman's trunk there, he deliberately eat down on it, and&#xD;
seemed disposed to enjoy the luxury of a nap.&#xD;
" Arrah, now be off, an come out o' that, will ye ?" shouted, the&#xD;
Irishman, as he discovered the trespasser on his property ; and at the&#xD;
same moment he sprung forward, laying his hand upon the intruder's&#xD;
shoulder, as if to enforceohis request.&#xD;
But that move was a fatal mistake of poor Pat's, for the half-drunken&#xD;
man made a sudden. "grab" at the Irishman's hat of black felt, and&#xD;
pulled it from his head. . ad it been but the hat, there would have&#xD;
been but little harm done; but with it came off a genuine Irish wig of&#xD;
red curly hair, and a pair of unmistakable Irish whiskers; and there,&#xD;
in the presence of all that company, and among them some seven or&#xD;
eight who knew him as well as they did themselves, stood unmasked,&#xD;
Ben Letts, the Bravo.-&#xD;
In a moment he was surrounded, and without a struggle or 'a word,&#xD;
ie gave himself up. But just as they were about to take him ashore,&#xD;
he requested permission to take his trunk with him.&#xD;
This was granted, and he carried it some distance to an open space,&#xD;
where he sat it down, and warned all his captors to stand back.&#xD;
They did so, and after waiting nearly ten minutes, the, trunk ex-&#xD;
ploded,-with a crash so tremendous that it shook the solid ground,&#xD;
hurled the frightened lookers-on from their feet, and broke out "the&#xD;
window-glass all over the town, like the rocking of an earthquake.&#xD;
&#xD;
126&#xD;
&#xD;
On. his examination, Letts confessed that it had been his intention&#xD;
to blow up the steamer, and himself with her.&#xD;
He was committed to prison, and only four weeks later, received his&#xD;
trial on the charge of an attempt to blow up the Great Britain, and was&#xD;
sentenced to seven years' transportation.&#xD;
Three days after the trial, the sheriff of Oswego county, assisted by&#xD;
a deputy, started from Oswego with the prisoner, ironed hand and foot,&#xD;
for the purpose of conveying him to Auburn.&#xD;
It was past noon when-they set out ; and having now travelled some&#xD;
twenty miles, and being near the village where they intended to stop&#xD;
for the night, as quick as thought, Letts struck the sheriff so tremnen-&#xD;
dous a blow on the head with his heavy manacles, that he felled him&#xD;
senseless'; and then raising both hands above his head, he brought them&#xD;
down with a sudden jerk, that sent the handcuffs off from his wrists&#xD;
with such velocity, that they nearly dashed through the side of. the&#xD;
carriage. The -next instant he dealt the astonished deputy a blow in&#xD;
the face that settled him alongside the sheriff, and leaping out, gained&#xD;
the cover of the forest and escaped.&#xD;
It was .known afterwards, that Letts had small, delicate hands, and&#xD;
unusually large wrists, which enabled him to slip off and on a pair of.&#xD;
handcuffs quite as readily as he could an-easy glove. But the mystery&#xD;
of his escape that evening, after he got clear of the coach, was never&#xD;
explained.&#xD;
One afternoon, ten days perhaps after this affair occurred, Colonel&#xD;
Henry Moody, who had been for nearly-three months stationed with his&#xD;
regiment in Montreal, while walking leisurely along down one of the&#xD;
streets, was suddenly arrested by a hand laid upon his shoulder; and&#xD;
as he raised his eyes from the pavement, they encountered the figure&#xD;
and face of his deadliest enemy, Ben Letts.&#xD;
For a brief space they stood there confronting each other in silence,&#xD;
and then the Bravo spoke-.&#xD;
" Henry Moody, I had thought to stab you to the heart, or shoot you&#xD;
down-like a dog; but my vengeance has been so long delayed that my&#xD;
hot blood has cooled somewhat; besides they say you are a brave man,&#xD;
as well as a heartless libertine. Take one of these, sir;" and the Bravo&#xD;
drew a pair of heavy dueling pistols from the bosom of his coat, one of&#xD;
which he reached towards the colonel, whose face all the while was pale&#xD;
as death, and his teeth chattered with coward fear, as if in an ague fit.&#xD;
Nevertheless, he snatched the weapon, and in an instant he fired at the&#xD;
Bravo, but in his agitation he missed him.&#xD;
Like lightning Letts sprang upon him, ana as his fingers grasped his&#xD;
throat, he hissed in his ear--&#xD;
"Down, d--d, accursed seducer !-down to hell, with your vile&#xD;
accomplice !'&#xD;
The muzzle of his pistol was placed against the colonel's forehead&#xD;
and discharged.&#xD;
When the hundreds who had heard those two shots rushed to the&#xD;
spot, they saw the dead body of Col. Moody, and on his breast, Scured&#xD;
by a dagger driven home to his heart, was another of those terrible&#xD;
cards, bearing the name of--BEN LETTS, THE BAvo.B-h-&#xD;
But Ben Lctts had escaped.           EB~o&#xD;
