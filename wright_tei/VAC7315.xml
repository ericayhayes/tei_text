CHAPTER I.&#xD;
The Alarm-The Flaines-The Ladder.&#xD;
SAN FuANoIsco, on the marge of the&#xD;
sea, with towering hills behind her, lay&#xD;
basking in the sun like a serpent by the&#xD;
side of a rock.&#xD;
The dwellings of the more fortunate&#xD;
classes loomed pleasantly on the side of&#xD;
the large round hills in the distance, and&#xD;
might with the aid of a little fancy, have&#xD;
been metamorphosed into the castellated&#xD;
domains of . the feudal barons whose&#xD;
reign succeeded that of absolute barbar-&#xD;
ism in Europe. Those quiet dwellings&#xD;
amid the solitude of nature, present a&#xD;
vivid contrast to the stirring scenes of&#xD;
&#xD;
the town below, and accordingly all who&#xD;
possess taste and the means of gratify-&#xD;
ing it, rear a building among the hills&#xD;
to which they can retire, after the fat-&#xD;
igues of the day, and solace themselves&#xD;
with the comforts of domestic retiracy,&#xD;
and the grand simplicity of nature.&#xD;
In giving a coup d'wiel at the scene,&#xD;
from the city itself, one is struck by the&#xD;
pointed roof rising above a range of hills&#xD;
which lie to the south west of the noble&#xD;
harbor, and which crowns a dark pile&#xD;
that, on a nearer approach, seems to&#xD;
lean against the side of a mountain upon&#xD;
whose peak linger the last beams of the&#xD;
setting sun. This extensive edifice is&#xD;
the dwelling or homestead of the wealthy&#xD;

8                     MYSTERIES .A&#xD;
and far-famed Senor de Castro, an old,&#xD;
resident of the country, and one of the&#xD;
proudest of the ancient lords of the soil.&#xD;
Ilis horses are the best, his table the&#xD;
most sumptuous, and his servants the&#xD;
most numerous of any ranchero in the&#xD;
regions round about California.&#xD;
It was early on one afternoon in June,&#xD;
18-, that several young men, mostly&#xD;
Americans, were conversing around a&#xD;
table in one of the principle Caffes in&#xD;
ne young city of San Francisco; a stout&#xD;
robust man nearly forty years of age,&#xD;
and dressed partly in the English style&#xD;
and partly in that of the country, with&#xD;
leggings and heavy blunt spurs,. and a&#xD;
red sash about his middle, was discuss-&#xD;
ing the merit of the auguadent sold in&#xD;
Santiago, -a city of Chille, and having&#xD;
become very eloquent on this important&#xD;
topic, he' set down his glass upon the&#xD;
table so violently as to shatter it to&#xD;
atoms.&#xD;
'Give me : your good old-fashioned&#xD;
horn tumbler,' cried he, with an oath,&#xD;
'and leave these baby-toys to the women&#xD;
and children !'&#xD;
You like to take your liquor in a&#xD;
horn ' said a young American clerk to&#xD;
a provision dealer, 'now I prefer a glass,&#xD;
if it were only for the cleanliness of the&#xD;
thing,&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, by the mass!&#xD;
Give me a glan,&#xD;
To toast a lass.&#xD;
In horns should never be.&#xD;
Remembered when&#xD;
We married men&#xD;
Quaffdenty or cheek thee.'&#xD;
'You married menP exclaimed the&#xD;
stouter disputant, laughing.&#xD;
£A marriage extempore,' muttered a&#xD;
saturnine  young   American, with     an&#xD;
enormous bead' of black hair.    'When&#xD;
are you going to send that little girl&#xD;
back to her mother?'&#xD;

'Silence, Pothook !' cried the other,&#xD;
'you know that you would have given&#xD;
all the old shoes in your locker to have&#xD;
got one smile from her, yourself'-&#xD;
'Yes, envious Pothook," cried anoth-&#xD;
er youth, whose accent betrayed the&#xD;
Cockney, 'if Cardwell has a notion to&#xD;
settle down in the calm of domestic life,&#xD;
and '-&#xD;
' Settle ! Ten thousand blunderbus-&#xD;
ses!' laughed the stout man, 'When did&#xD;
you ever know Cardwell to settle any-&#xD;
thing but his grog bills-them's the set-&#xD;
tlements he is most accustomed to.'&#xD;
'But I mean," added the Cockney;&#xD;
' that he is not running around after&#xD;
every pretty face like-like some people,&#xD;
always excepting the present honorable&#xD;
company, as a matter of course.'&#xD;
' Oh ! of course!' said Pothook feel-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
'Yet," remarked a tall, pale young&#xD;
man, who seemed to have recovered from&#xD;
some dangerous illness-' Yet, let me&#xD;
tell you that Cardwell is not so innocent&#xD;
after all, as he seems to be. I saw him,&#xD;
the other day, stand for half an hour,&#xD;
looking up at a certain house in Clay.&#xD;
street with all the eyes in his head, and&#xD;
meaning no offence to the gentleman,, I&#xD;
don't by any manner of means dispute&#xD;
his taste.'&#xD;
Oh ! the young villain' cried the&#xD;
stout man, roaring with laughter.&#xD;
In the midst of his jollity and noisy&#xD;
voeiferations, a young fellow from ' the&#xD;
States' who had been silent until then,&#xD;
demurely asked-' Do any of you know&#xD;
what is good for rats?'&#xD;
This made the stout man laugh still&#xD;
louder-' You had better enquire what&#xD;
is bad for rats,' said he at length ; ' for&#xD;
to judge by their sleek hides and plump&#xD;
bellies, I should think they had already&#xD;
&#xD;
had enough that was good and wholesom&#xD;
-perdition catch the born devils! Las&#xD;
night, about an hour before morning '-&#xD;
the speaker stopped, as the sound of a bel&#xD;
rang violently, and the cry of ' fire' a&#xD;
once arose in the streets.&#xD;
'Never mind, go'yon I' said the Cock&#xD;
ney.&#xD;
'Never mind the bell,' said Cardwell&#xD;
'We can't be disturbed in our pleasures&#xD;
by these domestic affairs.'&#xD;
'Why, by the noise,' said the stout&#xD;
man, 'it would appear that there was a&#xD;
polite invitation given to all citizens that&#xD;
their presence might be required in the&#xD;
adjoining streets, and as the wind is com-&#xD;
ing up fresh&#xD;
'There is no time to be lost, my good&#xD;
fellows !' cried a tall, elegantly formed&#xD;
youth, rushing into the apartment from&#xD;
an adjoining room. Half the city is in&#xD;
flames!'&#xD;
So saying, the youth hastened away,&#xD;
followed by the revellers.&#xD;
The whole town was in an uproar. As&#xD;
they gained the street, they were met by&#xD;
the strong sea breeze that filled the air&#xD;
with dust, and betokened no good to&#xD;
those whose property was at that mo-&#xD;
ment encircled by the flames.&#xD;
The- Sansome Truck Company, with&#xD;
their hooks and ladders, were rushing&#xD;
by, their scarlet coats powdered with&#xD;
dust, and making the iwelkin ring with&#xD;
their shouts. The elegant youth of whom&#xD;
we have spoken was one of the first that&#xD;
reached the fire. Already was the house&#xD;
of Senor del Castro completely enveloped&#xD;
by sheets of flame, and from the windows&#xD;
of some of the adjoining buildings the&#xD;
streams of fire -darted forth, and moved&#xD;
swiftly off toward the South on the wings&#xD;
of the gale.&#xD;
Several persons, among whom were&#xD;
&#xD;
e Cardwell, and the stout man of the cafe,&#xD;
t busied themselves in tearing up the&#xD;
- planks in the immediate vicinity of the&#xD;
l conflagration, for the streets being laid&#xD;
t down with plank, instead of stones, aid&#xD;
greatly in the spread of the flames. The&#xD;
- firemen, had brought streams of water&#xD;
to bear on the principal building, when&#xD;
suddenly there appeared at an upper&#xD;
window, a fair and youthful female form,&#xD;
evidently belonging to one of the higher&#xD;
t classes of the country, whose dark hair&#xD;
fell in rich masses about her shoulders,&#xD;
and partly concealed a face in which the&#xD;
snow and the rose contended for mae-&#xD;
tery.&#xD;
For an instant every one paused in&#xD;
astonishment, nor was her overmastering&#xD;
beauty unheeded in that moment of&#xD;
fearful excitement; for the cry that a&#xD;
woman was in the house now rose shrilly&#xD;
on the air, and was echoed in every&#xD;
street in the city. The ladders were&#xD;
hurried to the spot by men frantic in&#xD;
their hasto to save so fair a specimen of&#xD;
mortality from 'a dreadful death, while&#xD;
the object of all this interest, the lovely&#xD;
cause of the wild confusion that pervaded&#xD;
the masses below, simply placed one&#xD;
little white hand to her eyes as if to shut&#xD;
out the sight of the surrounding horrors,&#xD;
and steadied herself with the other by&#xD;
placing it on the sill of the window.&#xD;
In the moment that the ladder was&#xD;
placed against the side of the house, a&#xD;
shrill cry was heard in the rear of the&#xD;
firemen, and a stately form was seen forc-&#xD;
ing itself through the throng with giant&#xD;
strides, and thrusting aside e erybody&#xD;
and everything which opposed its pro-&#xD;
gress. One glance was suaficient to con-&#xD;
vince the spectators that the father of&#xD;
the imperrilled girl was rushing to her&#xD;
rescue. His hat was gone, and his dark&#xD;

but silvered leeks floated on the breeze, way up the ladder. All eyes were now&#xD;

forehead, and his face, though bearded all seemed silent except the hysteric&#xD;
and mustachoied according to the custom wailings of the anguished father, and&#xD;
of the country, was pale with anxiety the awful roaring of the flames, as the&#xD;
and horror.                         wind swept through every aperture of&#xD;
'Oh, for the love of God !' cried he, the building, and- aded ten-fold to the&#xD;
*my daughter ! my daughter!'       fury of the conflagration.&#xD;

into the house, the lower part of which girl were entirely hidden from view by&#xD;
was completely filled with flames. The the rolling forth of a dense volume of&#xD;
stout man of the cafe threw himself smoke streaked with flame. One cry-&#xD;
upon the distracted father, and by the one general cry of despair burst from&#xD;
timely aid of Cardwell and the Cockney, the throng below, and the Senor, not&#xD;
succeeded in dragging him out of the- -doubting that both his daughter and her&#xD;
reach of danger. But the fire com deliverer had perished, gave a deep groan&#xD;

ly uttered, the daring youth was half hair flowing down his back, while her&#xD;
&#xD;
OFA N FRA N TCr&#xD;
&#xD;
arms hung listless by his uides-she wa&#xD;
in a state of insensibility..&#xD;
As soon as Monteagle and his lovely&#xD;
burthen were within reach of the multi&#xD;
tude a dozen hands grasped them, an&#xD;
while the friends of the youth bore himn&#xD;
off on their shoulders to administer suci&#xD;
healing remedies as his case required, fo&#xD;
a part of his hair-his heavy brownie&#xD;
locks-was burnt off, and a blister on&#xD;
his forehead showed too plainly that a&#xD;
moment longer would have consigned&#xD;
both the young lady and her deliverer to&#xD;
the realm from which no returning&#xD;
spirit has come back to describe the final&#xD;
parting of the soul from its material en-&#xD;
velope.&#xD;
The girl herself was carried to the&#xD;
arms of her father, who, just awaking&#xD;
from his swoon, cried in a gasping voice&#xD;
'Inez ! Inez ! where is my Inez ?' and&#xD;
plucking a sharp-pointed dagger from his&#xD;
breast, he was about to end his agony by&#xD;
thrusting it to the hilt in his heart.&#xD;
Quicker than lightning, the man who&#xD;
was called Charley grasped the wrist of&#xD;
the desperate man, and holding it like a&#xD;
vice in his -stalwart grasp, pointed with&#xD;
the other hand to the girl, and said in his&#xD;
rough masculine voice :&#xD;
I 'None of that ! If I'd thought you&#xD;
would take it so-hard that we had saved'&#xD;
your daughter's life, but we would have&#xD;
-no, not that exactly, for she's worth&#xD;
saving on her 6wn account!'&#xD;
While Charley was delivering this&#xD;
speech, the cinders were raining down&#xD;
on his head, and be shook them off as a&#xD;
lion would have shaken great flies from&#xD;
his forehead, but others were not so in-&#xD;
sensible to a shower of fire-brands, and&#xD;
the Senor was dragged farther from the&#xD;
scene of ruin.&#xD;
When the senor perceived that his&#xD;
&#xD;
s Inez was really by his side, ho gave vent&#xD;
to the most extravagant exclamation of&#xD;
y joy. Rushing to the Chief Engineer,&#xD;
- whom he supposed to be the savior of&#xD;
d his child, he clasped the sturdy fireman&#xD;
a in his arms, called him every name that-&#xD;
h is flattering to the pride of man, emptied&#xD;
r his pockets of all his gold, and tried to&#xD;
force into his hands a precious ring that&#xD;
he wore on his finger, and which was&#xD;
said to contain a diamond of great value.&#xD;
Charley said that his duty called him&#xD;
elsewhere, and we next saw him plung-&#xD;
ing into the thickest of the throng to&#xD;
bring up his forces to the principal point&#xD;
of attack, and to expedite the tearing&#xD;
up of the planks on the street, for they&#xD;
had become thoroughly ignited in some&#xD;
places, and the flames were marching&#xD;
through the slight wooden buildings of&#xD;
the town with the imperious step of a&#xD;
conqueror.&#xD;
No sooner had the young lady recov-&#xD;
vered consciousness, than she raised her-&#xD;
self to her feet, avid looked anxiously&#xD;
on every. side as if in search of some&#xD;

reaching forth their long red tongues to- point farther down, some three hundred&#xD;
wards the pile of stores on Jackson yards from the spot where the pursuers&#xD;
&#xD;
18&#xD;
&#xD;
were clustered, and on turning their eyes&#xD;
in that direction, the crowd beheld a&#xD;
slender but well-formed youth tugging&#xD;
at a heavy boat, which lay partly on the&#xD;
shore and partly in the water, and vain-&#xD;
ly endeavoring to get it afloat.&#xD;
With a yell that rang on the air like&#xD;
the onset cry of a troop of wild Indians,&#xD;
the whole body of pursuers ran towards&#xD;
the boat.&#xD;
' Hah! Monteagle, is that you 'P cried&#xD;
our Cockney, who arrived first at the&#xD;
spot-' It was I who gave the alarm!&#xD;
How much is there in the safe'?' ' That&#xD;
is best known to my employers,' return-&#xD;
ed Monteagle evasively, 'enough, .you&#xD;
may be sure, to warrant the most vigor-&#xD;
ous endeavors in getting it into our&#xD;
hands. Those who take the thief will&#xD;
be well rewarded.'&#xD;
' Come then ! heave 0! heave, ahoi !'&#xD;
cried three or four lusty fellows who had&#xD;
now come up, and applied their shoulders&#xD;
to the boat in goqd earnest. It. began&#xD;
to move, and as it finally slid roaring in-&#xD;
to the waves, Monteagle, and a dozen&#xD;
others leaped on board. A few strokes&#xD;
of their long oars cleared them from the&#xD;
beach and gave free play to their motions&#xD;
as they sunk the blades of their oars&#xD;
deep into the brine, and threw themselves&#xD;
far back at every stroke ; a movement&#xD;
which to the practised eye of the mari-&#xD;
ner at once announced that whatever&#xD;
experience they might previously have&#xD;
had in this line, was not in the service&#xD;
of the nation, but had been acquired in&#xD;
the pursuit of that marvellous fish which&#xD;
swallowed Jonah.&#xD;

&#xD;
MYSTERIES ANIP MISRIES&#xD;
&#xD;
ertod his utmost, yet his pursuers oa-&#xD;
tinually gained upon him. He was ob-&#xD;
liged to stop a few moments to bail out&#xD;
his skiff, using one of his boots for that&#xD;
purpose; and this fact at once convinced&#xD;
Monteagle and his men that he labored&#xD;
under great disadvantages in a sharp,&#xD;
combing sea such as was then driving&#xD;
into the harbor. before the screaming&#xD;
gale. The thief himself seemed to give&#xD;
up all hope of escape and relaxed his&#xD;
efforts, no doubt husbanding his strength&#xD;
for exertions of a different character.&#xD;
' Now, my brave fellows,' cried Mont-&#xD;
eagle, 'lay back and give it to her ! do&#xD;
your prettiest and you can make the old&#xD;
barge hum, and we'll soon come up with&#xD;
that picaroon yonder; and understand&#xD;

'Oh, never mind the reward,' inter-&#xD;
rupted a stout Irishman, magnanimous-&#xD;
ly. 'It's for the pure honor of the thing&#xD;
that we are working, sure, and to sup-&#xD;
port the laws.'&#xD;

short, stout, red-faced fellow, of such&#xD;
equivocal appearance, that one might have&#xD;
taken him for a beardless youth or a man&#xD;
of sixty years, for a native or a foreigner,&#xD;
a cunning knave or a natural fool. H&#xD;
carried an enormous head on his broad&#xD;
round shoulders, upon which were only&#xD;
a few scattering hemp-like hairs, but his&#xD;
cheeks were fat and smooth, and his eyeu&#xD;
always seemed ready to roll out of their&#xD;
sockets.&#xD;

certain to the loyal party; then the for-&#xD;
mer would be up again and fighting des-&#xD;
perately. But three men against eight&#xD;
or nine could not hold out forever, and&#xD;
the big Irishman, at length, reeled and&#xD;
sank, overcome by fatigue and loss of&#xD;
blood. Big Head was then silenced by&#xD;
a rap on the skull with a tiller, and after&#xD;
a most desperate resistance, the robber-&#xD;
himself was bound hand and foot.&#xD;
The crew then sat down to take breath,&#xD;
and next proceeded to wash the blood&#xD;
from their faces. On their way to the&#xD;
shore they were met by another boat&#xD;
that had put off to their assistance, and&#xD;
in her was recognized Mr. Vandewater,&#xD;
one of the firm that had been robbed.&#xD;
'Where's Monteagle?' was the first&#xD;
enq'.uiry of this gentlemen as the two&#xD;
boats met.&#xD;
The boat's crew started and looked&#xD;
about them, discovered the youth lying&#xD;
senseless . in' the bottom of the boat.&#xD;
Smarting under their own wounds, and&#xD;
hot with the late contest, they had en-&#xD;
tirely forgotten the lad who led the&#xD;
charge. ' Oh 1' said the Cockney, bind-.&#xD;

sir. It was he that first got hold of the&#xD;

Mr. Vandewater by this time held the&#xD;
head of young Monteagle on his knee,I&#xD;
and was examining ito his condition,&#xD;
but, looking pp a moment, he replied to&#xD;
the Cockney,&#xD;
'And the safe, where is it!'1&#xD;

Mr. Vandewater assisted in removing&#xD;
Monteagle to the other boat, and telling&#xD;
the men in the barge to call in the morn-&#xD;
ing at his house, he told the rowers in&#xD;
his own yawl to pull for the skiff. The&#xD;
little bark was soon reached, and the&#xD;
safe was found in its bottom. Mr. Van-&#xD;
dewater took possession of his property,&#xD;
and returned speedily to the shore with&#xD;
Monteagle, whose situation, if he were&#xD;
indeed alive, required immediate atten-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
When the barge reached the landing,&#xD;
there was no lack of welcomers on the&#xD;
beach, for the latter part of the battle in&#xD;
the boat had been observed by many&#xD;
spectators. The robber, who had es-&#xD;
caped injury better than could have&#xD;
been expected, was handed out of the&#xD;
barge amid the shouts of the populace&#xD;
and taken possession of by the police.;&#xD;
but, strange as it may seem, the Irish-&#xD;
man and Big Head were suffered to go&#xD;
among their friends ; perhaps it was&#xD;
judged by their appearance that they had&#xD;
suffered punishment enough already.&#xD;
The devastations of the fire had been&#xD;
wide and fearful. In an incredible short&#xD;
time, a large portion of the cit had&#xD;
been laid in ruins.-Houses and streets&#xD;
had suffered alike, the planking of the&#xD;
thoroughfares rendering them equally&#xD;
combustible with the buildings.&#xD;
On the day succeeding these events, a&#xD;
pale youth, with a bandage about his&#xD;
temples, lay in a darkened room some&#xD;
two miles from the town of San Francis-&#xD;
co, seeming to be as&amp;amp;enp ; and yet the&#xD;
almost marble whiteness of th" features&#xD;
might have led a casual spectator to&#xD;

suppose that the coroner was required&#xD;
in his case, rather than the surgeon.&#xD;
The bed upon which he lay, as well as&#xD;
the chaste elegance of the furniture,&#xD;
about the apartment, betokened that the&#xD;
master of the- mansion had eminently&#xD;
been successful in the general sruggle&#xD;
for wealth, and also that he possessed a&#xD;
liberal taste which enabled him to em-&#xD;
ploy his means for the embellishment as&#xD;
well, as for the support -of life. The&#xD;
windows of the chamber looked out upon&#xD;
an extensive garden, nicely arranged and&#xD;
kept, and romantically varied with rocks&#xD;
and underwood of natural growth. The&#xD;
house'itself was an elegant edifice stand-&#xD;
ing on a hill-side, and commanding a fine&#xD;
view of the surrounding country.&#xD;
-.CHAPTER II.&#xD;
The Breaking Heart--A Scene of Ten-&#xD;
derness and Despair.&#xD;
The pale slumberer lay perfectly still,&#xD;
and a close observer could scarcely have&#xD;
perceived that he breathed. Thus had&#xD;
he lain a few moments, when a side door&#xD;
-     slowly opened,~and a fair feminine coun-&#xD;
tenance, a perfect blonde, surmounted&#xD;
with a profusion of flaxen ringlets, was&#xD;
thrust gently into the apartment. Then&#xD;
the door opened wider, and the symmetri&#xD;
cal form of a young girl of seventeen&#xD;
years stood in the apperture. She lis.&#xD;
tened a moment, and then advanced on&#xD;
tiny foot into the chamber ; then th&#xD;
other-; and finally she stood within the&#xD;
apartment, but with the door left opex&#xD;
behind her. There stood the beautifu&#xD;
sylph trembling and pale, and sometimes&#xD;
looking back, as if hesitating whether t&#xD;
proceed or return. At length she step&#xD;
lightly forward and fixed her eyes upoi&#xD;
&#xD;
the countenance of the slumberer. She&#xD;
instantly clasped her hands across her&#xD;
bosom, raised her.large blue eyes to hea-&#xD;
ven, and an expression of deep agony&#xD;
rested on those sunny features, like a&#xD;
heavy thunder cloud passing over a&#xD;
beauteous landscape in midsummer.&#xD;
Her timidity seemed to have fled with&#xD;
the first glance that she had bestowed&#xD;
upon the invalid. Turning her back to-&#xD;
wards him, she even murmured aloud,&#xD;
'And all this he has suffered for the&#xD;
preservation of my uncle's property.&#xD;
Oh! why could he not have delegated&#xD;
Cuat duty to others more fitted for such&#xD;
rude work?  Already had he performed&#xD;
a deed sufficient to gild his name with&#xD;
perpetual glory--in saving an accom-&#xD;
plished--an-an-in saving human life ;&#xD;
for it matters not who she was. To save&#xD;
a life is enough, and at the risk of his&#xD;
own.'&#xD;
She turned and looked once more at&#xD;
the sleeping youth ; again she pressed&#xD;
her hands against her heart, and, this&#xD;
time, she sighed deeply. A footstep was&#xD;
I heard in the passage way, approaching&#xD;
the door that opened into the hall, and&#xD;
gliding through the one at which she had&#xD;
entered, the young girl had retired, just&#xD;
as two other individuals entered the sick&#xD;
chamber. One of those who now ap-&#xD;
proached the couch of the invalid was&#xD;
a tall, slender, middle-aged man, elegant-&#xD;
-a ly attired, and yet with a sort of grace-&#xD;
e ful negligence which drew the attention&#xD;
e of the observer rather to the manners&#xD;
e and bearing of the gentleman himself,&#xD;
n than to the garb in which he was ar-&#xD;
l rayed.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
The Dance House-The Bella Union-&#xD;
The Last Stake !&#xD;
THE night was dark in San Francisco&#xD;
-that city far away on the confines of&#xD;
the Pacific. And far other scenes and&#xD;
other deeds are witnessed there than it&#xD;
ever entered into the imagination of the&#xD;
dwellers on the Atlantic sea-board to&#xD;
conceive of. Description is at fault;&#xD;
words cannot paint the mingled web,&#xD;
and fancy has no colors sufficiently vivid&#xD;
to depict the peculiar state of society in&#xD;
the newly-risen metropolis of California.&#xD;
Naturalists describe the state of the&#xD;
world long before man became a dweller&#xD;
upon the earth, and the fossils which they&#xD;
cure tell of strange animals that once&#xD;
existed here unlike anything which the&#xD;
world now presents.&#xD;
In Pacific street-named after the&#xD;
ocean that rolls her floods to the very&#xD;
doors of the Californian traders-there&#xD;
are several houses in which congregate&#xD;
the lower class of ruffians and pleasure-&#xD;
seekers, where the tamborene and fiddle&#xD;
are seldom allowed to rest, where the&#xD;
merry dance is kept up the live-long&#xD;
night by men of all nations, all complex-&#xD;
ions, and all professions. Here may be&#xD;
seen the Lasear, the Mulatto, the Chi-&#xD;
han, the Brazillian negro, the Nantucket&#xD;
whaleman, the escaped convict from Bo-&#xD;
tany Bay, the red-faced Englishman, the&#xD;
native of, the soil, the Mexican ; and&#xD;
every other class and nation is here re-&#xD;
presented. Men of standing, wealthy&#xD;
people here flock promiscuously with the&#xD;
lowest classes of all countries.&#xD;
It was in one of these dance halls,&#xD;
where the usual throng was engaged in&#xD;
&#xD;
beating the floor with their feet to the&#xD;
tune of the most simple instruments of&#xD;
music. Now a tall smooth fellow of jet&#xD;
blackness asked a light-haired Yankee&#xD;
to touch glasses with him, while a little&#xD;
infirm man in a blue nankeen jacket,&#xD;
who had once been the mate of a ship,&#xD;
could find nothing better than to explain&#xD;
to a Chinese sailor, in one corner, the&#xD;
way in which a Turk's head-knot was&#xD;
made upon a rope. But for the most&#xD;
part, boisterous mirth prevailed, some&#xD;
danced as if they had been bitten by a&#xD;
tarantula, while others  roared  out&#xD;
snatches from such songs as ears polite&#xD;
are not often saluted with.&#xD;
Whatever was done was thoroughly&#xD;
done, done with a vengeance, without&#xD;
restraint and without fear of disturbing&#xD;
the neighbors.-                  I&#xD;
On the night which we have mention-&#xD;
ed, the noise and confusion was unusual-&#xD;
ly great, the throng was more numerous&#xD;
than common from the fact that one&#xD;
watch was on shore from a whaleship in&#xD;
the harbor, and they had all blundered&#xD;
into this hall to drink and be merry.&#xD;
'Keep it up!' cried one long-legged,&#xD;
broad-shouldered fellow, throwing up one&#xD;
of his feet to the very wall and then&#xD;
dancing with a violence that threatened&#xD;
to bring down the roof about his ears.&#xD;
' He's a boatsteerer,' said one of the&#xD;
ship boys'-' he's great at striking a&#xD;
whale,' and he gazed with admiration on&#xD;
this specimen of Nantucket enterprise.&#xD;
'Keep it up !' shouted the boatsteerer&#xD;
making his long legs fly about the room&#xD;
as if he was under the influence of a&#xD;
galvanic battery.&#xD;
'Keep it up!' screamed he again, as&#xD;
he caught a short Englishman by the&#xD;
arm and tried to inspire' him with a por.&#xD;
tion of his own enthusiasm.&#xD;

had desired to ' keep it up,' and not sat-&#xD;
isfied with applying ' morql suasion' to&#xD;
the ease, he had taken the liberty to&#xD;
drag one or two of them into the middle&#xD;
of the floor by their long ear locks. Not&#xD;
hearing to dance on compulsion, they&#xD;
struck long-legs with their fists, and he&#xD;
gave them battle. He kept them at a&#xD;
distance a few moments with his long&#xD;
arms, but they made up for this by draw-&#xD;
ing their cochillars. Brandishing their&#xD;
knives they rushed upon him with great&#xD;
fury. Theother whalemen interfered in&#xD;
behalf of their shipmate, while all the&#xD;
scholars present took sides with their&#xD;
countrymen The battle threatened to&#xD;
be serious, and blood had already begun&#xD;
to. flow, when the door opened and a&#xD;
&#xD;
stout, broad-shouldered man entered the&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
' Charley, is that you? shouted the&#xD;
master of the house.&#xD;
' Yes, what is the muss?' cried the&#xD;
new-corner, whom the reader will recog-&#xD;
nize as the hero of the fire who took the&#xD;
ladder on his shoulders-' Hullo r here r&#xD;
knives out! daggers drawn ! Down, you&#xD;
rascals!'&#xD;
Charley then seized two of the most&#xD;
forward of the combatants in his Her-&#xD;
culean grasp, and hurled them against&#xD;
the wall, while the rest, recognizing the&#xD;
famous engineer, fell back, breathing&#xD;
heavily and eyeing their adversaries with&#xD;
murderous spite.&#xD;
Patrick and Jamie, who had thus far&#xD;
taken no part in the affray, felt them-&#xD;
selves aggrieved by the presence of an&#xD;
official whom they had no particular&#xD;
reasons for admiring, and whose presence&#xD;
had more than once been a check upon&#xD;
their professional labors. They first be-&#xD;
gan to grumble together in a low voice,&#xD;
and finding that they could do this with&#xD;
impunity, they felt emboldened to pro-&#xD;
ceed still farther.&#xD;
' The boys has got to be very civil in&#xD;
these times,' said Patrick.&#xD;
'Oh ! it was nothing but a little spree&#xD;
like, they was having-no harm at all,&#xD;
at all, in a free country, just for a lark&#xD;
like,' returned Jamie carelessly.&#xD;
' But the laws is very strict for all&#xD;
that,' said Patrick, nodding graciously.&#xD;
'Oh, murder, yes,' returned Jamie, 'its&#xD;
English laws they are like more than&#xD;
like what it used to be, before their'---&#xD;
'You mane the Vigilance Committee,&#xD;
Jamie ; oh! bad luck to 'em, they is no&#xD;

&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.                   27&#xD;
&#xD;
It was.midnight-Monteagle, reclined&#xD;
on a settee, which overlooked the table&#xD;
of rouge et noir, and feeling the sooth-&#xD;
ing effect of music and wine, said to&#xD;
Blodgett-&#xD;
' After all, Blodgett, there is a certain&#xD;
amount of evil in this world, and I do&#xD;
not know that one can make it less. It&#xD;
is like filling up part of a lake-the wa-&#xD;
ters only retire to another part.'&#xD;
'Yes,' interrupted the other carelessly&#xD;
-as he adjusted his cravat---'and the&#xD;
ministers have been preaching for eigh-&#xD;
teen centuries, and what have they ac-&#xD;
complished? They have only changed&#xD;
the character of sins, occasionally, while&#xD;
the same amount remains.&#xD;
' True,' said Monteagle, who was in a&#xD;
condition'to be pleased with a congenial&#xD;
mind-' the Puritans, for instance, were&#xD;
too pure to eat mince pies or kiss a child&#xD;
on Sunday ; so they made up for that by&#xD;
murdering Quakers and witches'&#xD;
'And what are speculators of all kinds&#xD;
but gamblers ?' continued the tempter ;&#xD;
'forestalling markets, laying up grain,&#xD;
and- other necessaries of life to increase&#xD;
the price and wring the last cent from&#xD;
the hard hands of the laboring poor."&#xD;
There was so much truth in all this&#xD;
that Monteagle began to entertain a&#xD;
higher opinion than ever of his compan-&#xD;
ion, without reflecting that the man who&#xD;
spoke thus would not scruple to do these&#xD;
very things himself, and much worse.&#xD;
' It is as you say,' returned Monteagle&#xD;
quite warmly-' your views coincide with&#xD;
mine exactly. It is singular, but I had&#xD;
supposed you to be a man of less reflec-&#xD;
tion and philosophy. I now perceive&#xD;
that you are a man of thought'-.-a&#xD;
'Oh ! I have my views as well as oth-&#xD;
ers, that's all  You must know that I&#xD;
was intended for a minister, and went to&#xD;
&#xD;
Andover. But come, just for amusement&#xD;
let's try our luck a little here. You&#xD;
can stop when you please, you know.'&#xD;
The, proposition was rather sudden ;&#xD;
Blodget saw the flush that shot into&#xD;
Monteagle's cheek, and quickly added-&#xD;
' To be a man of the world it is abso-&#xD;
lately necessary to know a little about&#xD;
playing, even if you don't. practice. All&#xD;
the natives play, and let me tell you&#xD;
that a spirited Margaritta regards a&#xD;
young man as a milk-sop who never lost&#xD;
or won a slug.'&#xD;
Something struck the mind of Mont-&#xD;
eagle at that moment, and he remained&#xD;
for a couple of minutes in a brown&#xD;
study, and seemed wholly unconscious of&#xD;
the presence of Blodget. The latter&#xD;
turned his face aside and smiled. It was&#xD;
a self-satisfied smile.&#xD;
At length said Monteagle, looking up,&#xD;
' How long have you known Mr. Brown,&#xD;
the partner of Vandewater ?'&#xD;
' Oh, these dozen years.  Ile and I&#xD;
have met here often.'&#xD;
' What ! does Mr. Brown play ?'&#xD;
'He! Rh'ss your souP-suddenly&#xD;
checking hius lf--lie plays the same as&#xD;
you and I might, just a little for sport.-&#xD;
That's all: he's not a heavy player; or,&#xD;
I might say it is more for amusement&#xD;
than anything else t hat he occasionally-&#xD;
very seldom, though-lays down a slug.'&#xD;
There are two classes of people who&#xD;
are quick at detecting villainy, the ac-&#xD;
complished rogue and the honest, simple-&#xD;
hearted man. The sight of the latter is&#xD;
the more clear of the two as far 'as it&#xD;
goes, while the former n ensures more&#xD;
correctly the extent of the int ided (de-&#xD;
ception. But Monteagle was. at this&#xD;
moment, disposed to interpret every&#xD;
thing in the most favorable mnnmer, and&#xD;
fancied that he saw in Blodget's hesita-&#xD;

28               MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
tion a generous endeavor to conceal the&#xD;
picadilloes of Mr. Brown, his employer.&#xD;
He felt .convinced that Blodget knew&#xD;
more than he was willing to tell, and&#xD;
there rushed upon his recollection sev-&#xD;
eral little circumstances of a somewhat&#xD;
equivocal character connected with the&#xD;
conduct of Mr. Vandewater's partner.&#xD;
Just then, a stout, rude, and hairy&#xD;
man, nearly as broad as he was long, with&#xD;
large goggle eyes, and a low, retreating&#xD;
forehead, came swaggering up to Blod-&#xD;
get, followed by a large and very savage-&#xD;
looking dog.&#xD;
'Good night-good night-my old&#xD;
boy,' cried he in a rough and loud tone.&#xD;
Ha ! ha ! glad to see you.'&#xD;
Blodget stared at the fellow as if he&#xD;
had some trouble in recognizing him&#xD;
'No savez. eh ! No savez I' cried the&#xD;
man. ' Oh, well, any other time will do.&#xD;
I understand-a pigeon there-don't&#xD;
-3 "  want to be known, ha ! ha ! I'm just from&#xD;
Sacramento, old boy. Plenty of dust'-&#xD;
At this moment, the dog, who had&#xD;
been smelling about Monteagle, braced&#xD;
himself opposite the youth and gave a&#xD;
horrible growl, during which he showed&#xD;
his fangs. The youth, believing that the&#xD;
animal was about to spring upon him,&#xD;
drew a small revolver, and prepared to&#xD;
defend himself.&#xD;
' Eh-youngster!' bellowed the brutal&#xD;
owner of the dog. 'Love me, love my&#xD;
dog, you know. Don't hurt that dog,&#xD;
sir.&#xD;
Certainly not, unless he attempts to&#xD;
hurt me,' returned Monteagle.&#xD;
Afraid of a dog, eh ?  Ha, ha 1'&#xD;
'No, not afraid of a dog,' returned&#xD;
Monteagle, highly incensed,'for you may&#xD;
observe that I don't act as if I was&#xD;
afraid of you, do I?'&#xD;
'Seize hmi; Boatswain!' shouted the&#xD;
&#xD;
scoundrel, and the dog; nothing loth&#xD;
sprang at the young man, and before he&#xD;
could place himself on his guard, had&#xD;
fastened his teeth in his vest. At the&#xD;
same instant, Monteagle, sparing the&#xD;
brute, aimed his pistol at the owner and&#xD;
snapped the trigger. The ball justgraz-&#xD;
ed one of the fat cheeks of the rascal,.&#xD;
who, thereupon, threw himself upon the&#xD;
youth and begun to pummel him with&#xD;
his fists. It must be remembered that&#xD;
Monteagle had not yet recovered from&#xD;
his wound. Nevertheless, he defended&#xD;
himself bravely. But Blodget, as soon&#xD;
as he saw the conduct of the wretch,&#xD;
gave him a blow on the side of his head&#xD;
that felled him like an ox. At the same&#xD;
time, the dog left Monteagle and seized&#xD;
Blodget. Monteagle threw his pistol at&#xD;
the dog, and hit him in the side without&#xD;
Going him much damage ; but Blodget&#xD;
turned quickly and drove a short, sharp&#xD;
dagger to the hilt in the animal's breast.&#xD;
That finished the business for the dog.&#xD;
But his savage owner was about stabbing&#xD;
Blodget in the back with a long, two-&#xD;
edged knife when Monteagle gave him a&#xD;
sudden push, which sent him reeling to&#xD;
the distance of several paces.  3lodget&#xD;
and his enemy then encountered each&#xD;
other face to face, and as both were arm-&#xD;
ed with deadly instruments, the issue&#xD;
would h ve been bloody had not several&#xD;
of the crowd, which had by this time&#xD;
clustered around the combatants, plucked&#xD;
them asunder. The stout man swore&#xD;
and threatened vengeance, and as he&#xD;
struggled hard to get away from .those&#xD;
who held him, he was finally thrust out&#xD;
of doors with some violence.  He was&#xD;
heard, for some time, prowling outside&#xD;
and threatening all manner of vengeance&#xD;
against Monteagle and Blodget, especial-&#xD;
ly the latter whom he charged with all&#xD;

Shortly after the town was in an up- he expected to meet on that spot. A&#xD;

sounded through the air, and many peo- any occasion for. He grazed the youth's&#xD;
&#xD;
elbow as he went by, and appeared to do&#xD;
it on purpose.&#xD;
Monteagle turned to look at the man,&#xD;
and the latter turning also, clapped his&#xD;
hands on his hips, and with a swagger-&#xD;
ing air, looked the former saucily in the&#xD;
face. Monteagle thought he had seen&#xD;
the fellow before ; he was dressed much&#xD;
as an ordinary laborer, large in size, with&#xD;
big coarse features that glowed with the&#xD;
effect of frequent potations.&#xD;
Monteagle was about to . turn away&#xD;
from the man in disgust, when he said-&#xD;
'I think yees will know me when yees&#xD;
sees me again.'&#xD;
' Why so?'&#xD;
'Bekase yees trying to look off the&#xD;
countenance of me, I believe.'&#xD;
' I shall look where I please, and as&#xD;
long as I please,' returned Monteagle.&#xD;
' That's unfortunit agin,' said the&#xD;
Irishman, 'for yees will see nothing but&#xD;
a jintleman, and that's what yees not&#xD;
used to seeing inside of the looking-&#xD;
glass.'&#xD;
' What is the object of these insults,&#xD;
you scoundrel?' cried Monteagle, still in&#xD;
the belief that he had fallen in with the&#xD;
fellow before, but where he could not re-&#xD;
collect.&#xD;
'Oh-no object at all, at all. But if I&#xD;
is a scoundrel, there's more than one on&#xD;
the Plaza jist, and he's not beyond the&#xD;
raitch of my fist, nythur.'&#xD;
This was rather too much for Mont-&#xD;
eagle's patience, and accordingly be rush-&#xD;
ed upon the intruder and saluted him&#xD;
with a violent blow in the face. The&#xD;
Irishman staggered backwards a few feet&#xD;
and then recovering himself approached&#xD;
the youth in a boiling rage. As they&#xD;
&#xD;
one attempted to interfere. Monteagle&#xD;
was a pupil of Frank Wheeler's and the&#xD;
science he had acquired from the teach-&#xD;
ings of that accomplished gymnast en-&#xD;
abled him to bother his bulky antagonist&#xD;
a good deal. This rendered the latter&#xD;
exceedingly angry, and a cry was raised&#xD;
by the by-standers, as they saw a Span-&#xD;
ish knife in the hand of the Irishman,&#xD;
which he had dexterously drawn from&#xD;
some part of his dress, and with which&#xD;
he rushed upon the youth with the evi-&#xD;
dent design of finishing him and the bat-&#xD;
tle together. At that moment, and just&#xD;
as the youth had 'caught a glimpse of&#xD;
the steel flashing before his eyes, a pow-&#xD;
erful hand was laid upon the shoulder of&#xD;
the Irishman, and he was drawn violent-&#xD;
ly backwards. Some of the crowd began&#xD;
to murmur, but the Irishman looked in-&#xD;
to the countenance of the intruder, and&#xD;
both he and Monteagle pronounced the&#xD;
word 'Blodget!'&#xD;
'How now, sir. What are you doing&#xD;
with that knife ?' cried Blodget in a pe-&#xD;
remptory tone.&#xD;
You see it's the thafe himself, the&#xD;
bloody robber !' said the Irishman, pas-&#xD;
sionately, though evidently cowering un-&#xD;
der the gaze of Blodget.&#xD;
' Who told you he was a thief? Be-&#xD;
gone, sir!' cried Blodget, 'Mr. Monteagle,&#xD;
I find you in bad company. Is that an&#xD;
acquaintance of yours?' continued Blod-&#xD;
get, with a gay laugh, as lie turned to our&#xD;
youth, and pointed at the retreating&#xD;

&#xD;
take the fellow-did he hurt you much?'&#xD;
'Better ask if I hurt him,' returned&#xD;
the youth, 'for I think he would have&#xD;
carried away a piece of maleable metal&#xD;
with him, but for your opportune deliv-&#xD;
erance.'&#xD;
'If he had not been too quick for you&#xD;
--he's dexterous in the use of the&#xD;
knife.'&#xD;
'Is he, indeed ?'&#xD;
'You wonder how I found out that&#xD;
fact. I have heard of his encounters&#xD;
with the natives. His name is James,&#xD;
commonly called Jamie, and there are&#xD;
many stories extant as to his prowess.'&#xD;
'Strange he should have taken so&#xD;
much pains to insult me,' said Mont-&#xD;
eagle.&#xD;
'He seemed to have something against&#xD;
you,' answered Blodget. 'Cannot you&#xD;
remember of ever seeing him before?'&#xD;
Blodget watched the countenance of&#xD;
Monteagle narrowly, as the youth replied,&#xD;
'I have some faint recollection of the&#xD;
fellow's face. His nose, that seems to&#xD;
have been knocked out of its proper&#xD;
shape, struck me like an old acquaint-&#xD;
ance, but where, and under what circum-&#xD;
stances I have seen it before, I am un-&#xD;
able to determine. But let him go. You&#xD;
and me are met now. for another pur-&#xD;
pose.'&#xD;
'Let us walk along towards Dupont&#xD;
street,' said the other, musing.&#xD;
'Well, on then. But what engages&#xD;
your thoughts at this moment?'&#xD;
'As for that, Monteagle, what would&#xD;
you give to know ?&#xD;
'It's not very important, I'll be sworn.&#xD;
Some love affair doubtless.'.&#xD;
'You are a wizard,' replied Blodget.-&#xD;
'It is a love affair, but one that inter-&#xD;
ests you much more than me.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Interest me?' said the youth, much&#xD;
surprised.&#xD;
'It is a great secret, sir,' and Blodget&#xD;
squeezed the arm of his companion.&#xD;
'If it is a secret you are bound to&#xD;
keep it close. Is it not so?' -&#xD;
'Not exactly.  But come into this&#xD;
shantee with me, and I will explain mat-&#xD;
ters to your full satisfaction.' .&#xD;
Monteagle followed his friend into the&#xD;
wine shop, nothing loth ; for though he&#xD;
assumed an indifferent air, he could not&#xD;
feel altogether uninterested in an affair&#xD;
of this kind. Besides, like all young&#xD;
men on such occasions, his curiosity was&#xD;
powerfully excited.&#xD;
Blodget sat down in one corner and&#xD;
beckoned to the host to set on a bottle&#xD;
of champagne. He then pressed Mont-&#xD;
eagle to drink who, at first, refused, but&#xD;
being in haste to hear the news, he final-&#xD;
ly tossed off a glass in order to hurry on&#xD;
the recital which Blodget had in store&#xD;
for him.,&#xD;
' It is a strange story,' said Blodget,&#xD;
smacking his lips-' good wine'&#xD;
'But this queer business-the love&#xD;
story-some Mexican squaw, I suppose,&#xD;
has ---'&#xD;
' No - no. You are a lucky dog,&#xD;
Monteagle.'&#xD;
'Very likely.'&#xD;
Here Blodget poured out another glass'&#xD;
and nodded to his companion-' Take&#xD;
another, and then to business.'&#xD;
Monteagle drank to save time, and&#xD;
said ; 'go on with this wonderful story.'&#xD;
'Well,' said the other, ' I think your&#xD;
chance is good. The firm hold you in&#xD;
high estimation --'&#xD;
' Fudge ! no more of that --'&#xD;
' But I must tell the story in my own&#xD;

Monteagle started to his feet.&#xD;
'Sit down, friend of mine, and let us&#xD;

'Certainly. But who told you this?-&#xD;
&#xD;
'Not at all; easy enough. Vandewa-&#xD;

girl, he turned to another. At the close ly habit of visiting gambling-houses and&#xD;
of the evening, Monteagle found himself places of debauchery, upon whose con-&#xD;
in conversation with the lively and in- duct no remark was made. The reason&#xD;
telligent Spanish maid, who told him of this may have occurred to the reader.&#xD;
that she came from Santiago, a city of Monteagle was highly esteemed by his&#xD;
Chile, and where, from some words that employers, and an opinion had got about&#xD;
accidentally dropped from her, he was&#xD;
&#xD;
36&#xD;
&#xD;
that he was something better than com-&#xD;
mon. All men are said to respect vir-&#xD;
tue, and consequently the aberration of&#xD;
Monteagle was very comforting to such&#xD;
as had previously regarded him with a&#xD;
sentiment approaching to envy. We&#xD;
may as well say, also, in this place, that&#xD;
the love of Julia Vandewater had been&#xD;
won as. much by the unusual sobriety&#xD;
and decorum of Monteagle's conduct as&#xD;
by his personal and intellectual endow-&#xD;
ments. She regarded bim as a very un-&#xD;
common young man ; and it may be&#xD;
perceived by the importance which Blod-&#xD;
get attached to his 'secret,' that Julia&#xD;
was regarded as a great prize, and one&#xD;
not to be aspired to by every young fel-&#xD;
low in San Francisco.  Julia Vande-&#xD;
water could have commanded the admi-&#xD;
ration of any bachelor in California,&#xD;
whatever might have been his talents and&#xD;
acquirements, with the one exception of&#xD;
.Lorenzo Monteagle, who, while he re-&#xD;
garded her with the affection of a brother,&#xD;
had-lived under the same roof with the&#xD;
young lady long enough to know that he&#xD;
could never feel toward her as he ought'&#xD;
to feel towards the woman whom he!&#xD;
made his partner for life. But this con-&#xD;
clusion had not been formed upon any&#xD;
improprieties in the conduct or conversa-&#xD;
tion of the young lady. Had Monteagle&#xD;
a brother who was enamored of Julia, he&#xD;
would have rejoiced to have seen a union&#xD;
take place between them : but there was&#xD;
the important point-it was necessary to&#xD;
be enamored first, for without that he&#xD;
believed that respect and  friendship&#xD;
could not insure a happy marriage. On&#xD;
her part Julia loved sincerely, and for&#xD;
nothing more than for the virtuous and&#xD;
circumspect deportment of Monteagle.&#xD;
I have said that our youth had been&#xD;
fascinated with Maria. He was, in high&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
I spirits; he was pleased with the idea of&#xD;
having gained so pretty and genteel a&#xD;
F mistress, for she had in the tenderest&#xD;
manner, consented to be exclusively his&#xD;
as long as he might feel disposed tokeep&#xD;
her, Patting him on his bump of benev-&#xD;
olence with her taper finger, she had said,&#xD;
' Pretty American lad, I love you much.&#xD;
I love your face. I love your figure, and&#xD;
your voice. I shall be much please with&#xD;
you to-day and to-morrow all the same.&#xD;
Oh, you is one pretty. Come up to my&#xD;
room and y'u shall see how I love you,&#xD;
mine friend.'&#xD;
Monteagle obeyed this tender request.&#xD;
From such lips and enforced with a voice&#xD;
ringing like a silver-bell, it was impossi-&#xD;
ble for him to disobey the command.&#xD;
Blodget saw and heard it all; and when&#xD;
the enamored couple shut the door be-&#xD;
hind them, he placed his jewelled finger&#xD;
on one side of his nose, and winked to the&#xD;
Scottish-girl who appeared to fully un-&#xD;
derstand it.&#xD;
For the last half~iour that Monteagle&#xD;
had remained in the saloon, he had over-&#xD;
heard a lively conversation between&#xD;
three pretty French girls, carried on in&#xD;
their vernacular, which had for its object&#xD;
a lady apparently from Lima, as she was&#xD;
dressed in their peculiar attire. Her&#xD;
dress was dark, fitted to the form in a&#xD;
peculiar manner, so as to show the swell&#xD;
of the hips, without being wide and flow.&#xD;
ing like the dress of, our ladies. Her form&#xD;
was entirely hidden, except that a small&#xD;
aperture permitted her to look abroad&#xD;
with one eye. This dress is singular,'&#xD;
and yet it is worn by all fashionable la-&#xD;
dies in certain parts of South America.&#xD;
This lady had spoken little since her&#xD;
entrance, while she seemed to be an at-&#xD;
tentive observer of all that passed. The&#xD;
French girls were wondering who she&#xD;
&#xD;

OF SAN FRANGISCO.                    39&#xD;
&#xD;
was.   Their observations were piquant f&#xD;
and full of wit;,and as Monteagle was mx&#xD;
a perfect master of the French language,&#xD;
he was not a little entertained by their b&#xD;
funny remarks. To him, however, the d&#xD;
presence of the strange lady was a mat s&#xD;
ter of very little interest. As her- face B&#xD;
was invisible, she might be a perfect o&#xD;
fright for all that he knew to the contra-&#xD;
ry, and in the few half-understood words&#xD;
that fell from her lips, he discovered no e&#xD;
more than the most common-place obser- a&#xD;
vations  He did, however, observe that I&#xD;
the mistress of the establishment-a 1&#xD;
very beautiful and accomplished woman&#xD;
herself-treated the incognito with marks&#xD;
of the highest respect.&#xD;
Scarcely had Monteagle placed his l&#xD;
foot on the stairs to-follow Maria to an&#xD;
upper apartment, when the unknown ap-&#xD;
peared in the hall, and having thrust at&#xD;
billet into the hand of the girl, turnedI&#xD;
and left the house immediately.&#xD;
Maria laughed slightly.&#xD;
'What is this?' said she, in her broken&#xD;
English.  'One letter to read ! Oh !&#xD;
very good ; I. shall read you a letter,&#xD;
mine friend.: So much the better. I shall&#xD;
see.'&#xD;
Pausing a moment, Maria opened the&#xD;
note, and read it by the light of the&#xD;
chandelier.  The paper dropped from&#xD;
her-hand, and she stood a moment as if&#xD;
transfixed with astonishment.&#xD;
'She 1 Oh I She ! the~ holy and de-&#xD;
voted ones!' cried Maria, at last, clasping&#xD;
her hands. 'She, here--she come to&#xD;
this place--and all for me-for me-'&#xD;
'Come, come,' cried the impatient&#xD;
youth. ' Come, my beautiful one, and&#xD;
let us enjoy  -'&#xD;
'Enjoy nothing. Not to-night; some&#xD;
other time. . I can do nothing to-night.&#xD;
a-o she has remembered me. She has not&#xD;
&#xD;
forgotten those days of innocence. Ab,&#xD;
ie-they are goneanow!'&#xD;
These words were spoken in Spanish ;&#xD;
ut Monteagle found no difficulty in un-&#xD;
erstandirg them, and they partially re-&#xD;
tored him to a sense of his present plight.&#xD;
But who was this 'holy and devoted&#xD;
ne ' Some nung no doubt, who had&#xD;
tepped between him and his enjoyments.&#xD;
Monteagle, whose passions were much&#xD;
xcited, stood looking at the fine form&#xD;
and swelling graces of the Spanish girl;&#xD;
her tapering limbs, her little feet, her&#xD;
arge dark eyes, and lovely mouth.&#xD;
' Surely,' said he, ' you will not be so&#xD;
unkind --'&#xD;
' Hush !' cried Maria, clapping her&#xD;
hand on his mouth. ' I am nothing.this&#xD;

and I cannot see you to-night,' and here&#xD;
the girl sat down upon the stairs, and&#xD;
fell into a deep reverie.&#xD;
'What shall I do 1' thought Montea-&#xD;
gle, 'If I speak to another girl, every eye&#xD;
will be upon me ; all sorts of surmises.&#xD;
No, no, I have it. I will consult Blod-&#xD;
get.,&#xD;
He then slipped a slug into the hand&#xD;
of Maria. who seemed to be almost un-&#xD;
conscious of the act, and stepping to the&#xD;
door of the saloon, he' opened it, and&#xD;
called to his companion.&#xD;
Blodget was lazily conversing with the&#xD;
mistress of the house upon some topic&#xD;
of general interest, and though surround-&#xD;
ed on all sides by the most fascinating&#xD;
beauties of almost every civilized country&#xD;
-who threw out their lures, to entrap&#xD;
him, he appeared as unconscious as a&#xD;
pair of tongs in a china shop. When he&#xD;
heard Monteagle pronounce his name,&#xD;
he looked up surprised: he fairly started,&#xD;
and seizing his hat, quickly came out to&#xD;
&#xD;
him. They passed into the street to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
'What have you done with Maria ?'&#xD;
said Blodget.&#xD;
'She has received a note from some-&#xD;
body, and has retired alone to ponder&#xD;
upon its contents,' answered the youth.&#xD;
' Oh! I know-I think, at least, that&#xD;
the lady who followed you out-the lady&#xD;
in the mask-ha ! ha ! ha ! I think that&#xD;
she must have brought the note.  But&#xD;
did she not make you acquainted with&#xD;
its contents ?'&#xD;
'No. But whatever its contents were,&#xD;
they made a deep impression upon her.'&#xD;
' Ah,' exclaimed Bllodget, stopping as&#xD;
if to think. 'I have heard something&#xD;
of this. I think I understand something&#xD;
of it. You must know that Maria re-&#xD;
ceived her education at a convent in&#xD;
Santiago, about a hundred miles from&#xD;
Valparaiso, an old-fashioned city where&#xD;
religion flourishes. This is a religieuse&#xD;
who came to the house enveloped in the&#xD;
costume of that city; and I think I have&#xD;
learned that Maria was the bosom friend&#xD;
of a young lady of flee promise, and very&#xD;
devout habits, before she took to the&#xD;
road.'&#xD;
' The road'?'&#xD;
'Yes that broad road that we read of.'&#xD;
'Thiese are singular girls,' said Mont-&#xD;
eagle. *'Instead of more hacknied mer-&#xD;
cenaries they seem to be women of sen-&#xD;
timent and feeling.'&#xD;
' Well, I can show you a few such'--&#xD;
A heavy sigh breathed by some person&#xD;
near them caused Monteagle to turn&#xD;
around.&#xD;
The lady incognito was near them,&#xD;
and the sigh must have come from her ;&#xD;
but whether it had any relation to their&#xD;
conversation or not they were unable to&#xD;
determine. She did not look towards&#xD;
&#xD;
them, as she passed. Perhaps that the&#xD;
sigh had some connection with the un-&#xD;
fortunate Maria. Still as her dark form&#xD;
receded from view, Monteagle could not&#xD;
but remember that it was immediately&#xD;
after Blodget's proposition to show him&#xD;
other females, when this sigh was breath-&#xD;
ed.&#xD;

Tux  walked forward amid the dark-&#xD;
ness till they came to a house in Sacra-&#xD;
mento street, where instead of the sound&#xD;
of merry voices which they had expected,&#xD;
their ears were saluted by the most vio-&#xD;
lent oaths and denunciations.&#xD;
' How is this ?' said Monteagle, 'is it a&#xD;
ring fight to which you are conveying&#xD;
me ?'&#xD;
' You may well ask that,' replied Blod-&#xD;
get, stopping to listen ; these are un-&#xD;
usual sounds to- proceed from this house.&#xD;
Here seems to be more of Mars than&#xD;
Venus.'&#xD;
As they came to the door it was vio-&#xD;
lently thrown open, and several females&#xD;
ran screaming into the street.&#xD;
'Go in there!' cried one of the girls,&#xD;
recognizing Blodget; 'for God's sake go&#xD;
in, or there will be murder done.'&#xD;
Blodget and Monteagle hastened to&#xD;
the apartment from which the noise pro-&#xD;
ceeded, and there they beheld a table&#xD;
overturned and China ware scattered&#xD;
about the floor, while a stout, middle-&#xD;
aged man, with every appearance of a&#xD;
gentleman, lay on the floor, and another,&#xD;
equally re-s ceniable in appearance, was&#xD;

&#xD;
kneeling on his breast, with a revolver in I&#xD;
his hand, and aimed at the throat of the ii&#xD;
prostrate man.     .&#xD;
' What ! gentlemen !' exclaimed Mont-&#xD;
eagle, 'forbear!' apd he was proceeding p&#xD;
to the relief of the fallen man when&#xD;
Blodget caught him by the arm, andt&#xD;
whispered,' Let them alone. It is all&#xD;
right. I know them both!'&#xD;
'You know them?' cried Monteagle, l&#xD;
struggling to throw off his friend's firm&#xD;
grasp, ' but is that any reason that they&#xD;
should murder each other?'&#xD;
'That fellow seduced his wife !' criedY&#xD;
Blodget.1&#xD;
' Promise, villain ! promise!' roared&#xD;
the man with a pistol.  'Promise, or I I&#xD;
finish you on the spot.'&#xD;
' Help, I say,' cried the undermost&#xD;
man, frothing with rage and pale with&#xD;
terror-'Release me from this madman.'1&#xD;
' Madman!' cried he with the pistol.&#xD;
Is it mad that I am when I claim that&#xD;
you shall marry the woman whom you&#xD;
have stolen away from home and happi-&#xD;
ness.. Gentlemen, you see here a villain&#xD;
-a banker of this city-who bloated&#xD;
with pride, and presuming on his wealth,&#xD;
seduced my wife and brought her to this&#xD;
city. I procured a divorce in such a&#xD;
manner that my ruined wife can marry&#xD;
again. I followed her and her paramour&#xD;
to this city, and here I find him rioting&#xD;
in a house of ill fame, while the woman&#xD;
that he has blasted-my late wife-&#xD;
pines in eolitude at home, where she is&#xD;
scarcely allowed the necessaries of life.&#xD;
Now, you villain, see if these gentlemen,&#xD;
will aid you.'&#xD;
'No,' said Monteagle. ' We cannot&#xD;
interfere here ; but pray don't shoot the&#xD;
villain in cold blood."&#xD;
' His life is safe, if he promises to&#xD;
marry the woman,' cried the- wronged&#xD;
&#xD;
husband ; ' Otherwise he dies ! Prom-&#xD;
se !' and he thrust the muzzle of the&#xD;
pistol against the seducer's forehead.&#xD;
' Murder-help !' cried the man, strug-&#xD;
gling desperately to regain his feet.&#xD;
' Promise, rascal, promise to marry&#xD;
the woman, and I release you.'&#xD;
Perhaps with the hope of making his&#xD;
escape if he consented, the banker at&#xD;
length said, 'Let me up, and I will mar-&#xD;
ry the       '                      -&#xD;
' Call no names for she is your wife.&#xD;
cried the other, suffering the banker to&#xD;
regain his feet, but no sooner was he&#xD;
up than he made a rush for the door-&#xD;
the outraged husband levelled a pistol at&#xD;
his head, and in order to save his life,&#xD;
Monteagle and B lodget seized the sedu-&#xD;
cer, and in spite of his struggles, held&#xD;
him fast. The divorced husband then&#xD;
begged our two friends to lead the&#xD;
banker forward. Being concerned for&#xD;
his life, and thinking their presence ne-&#xD;
cessary to his safety, Monteagle and&#xD;
Blodget led the man down the street,&#xD;
the husband leading the way, pistol in&#xD;
hand. In an obscure street, they enter-&#xD;
ed a, low-roofed building, where they&#xD;
found the unfaithful wife-attended by a&#xD;
clergyman.&#xD;
The banker started, as this vision met&#xD;
his gaze, and he would fain have retreat-&#xD;
ed; but he was held by his two conduc-&#xD;
tors as in a vice.&#xD;
'Here,' said the injured husband to&#xD;
the seducer-'here is the woman whom&#xD;
you are to marry. I have procured a&#xD;
divorce from her, and left her free. You&#xD;
took her from me-from a good home-&#xD;
you have had her as long as it suited&#xD;
your convenience, but have now almost&#xD;
entirely cast her off in a strange land.-&#xD;
You shall marry her.'&#xD;
The clergyman and all the others&#xD;
&#xD;
present said that it was no more than&#xD;
justice. Finding there was no other&#xD;
way, the banker yielded and married&#xD;
the woman whom he had seduced.&#xD;
After witnessing the ceremony, and&#xD;
receiving the hearty thanks of the late&#xD;
husband, Blodget and Monteagle with-&#xD;
drew.&#xD;
'What do you think of this scene ?'&#xD;
said Blodget to Monteagle, as soon as&#xD;
they were alone together in the street.&#xD;
'I think it is a hard case in every view&#xD;
of it,' returned the youth. ' The man&#xD;
has lost his wife-the seducer has mar-&#xD;
ried one whom he cannot love, and the&#xD;
new wife will doubtless have a hard,&#xD;
time of it with the fellow.'&#xD;
'The husband was bent on revenge,'&#xD;
said Blodget, and in rivetting the two&#xD;
criminals together, I think he has pun-&#xD;
ished both. It is not likely the wife&#xD;
will ever live to inherit the banker's&#xD;
wealth He will either de l a ;oi:  1&#xD;
her with unkindness.'&#xD;
' But shall we not go back to the&#xD;
house?' inquired Monteaglo.&#xD;
Blodget perceived that the young&#xD;
clerk's feelings had been too highly&#xD;
wrought up by the contemplation of fe-&#xD;
male beauty to admit of his returning&#xD;
peaceably home without first becoming&#xD;
better acquainted with one of the inmates&#xD;
of the house which they had last visited.&#xD;
He was not averse to returning to the&#xD;
temple of pleasure, and accordingly he&#xD;
replied in the affirmative.&#xD;
But on returning to the house, they&#xD;
found the light out, and the parties re-&#xD;
tired for the night, for the dawn of day&#xD;
was not far off.&#xD;
It was enough for Blodget that he had&#xD;
inducted Monteagle into the downward&#xD;
path. He did not doubt that, hereafter&#xD;
the young man wou!d take rapid strides&#xD;
&#xD;
towards the point whither he was so de-&#xD;
sirous of directing his steps.&#xD;
Monteagle separated from his com-&#xD;
panion and returned home, wipre he wag&#xD;
soon in the land of drearps.&#xD;
le awoke late in the morningand felt&#xD;
a little confused after his night's career ;&#xD;
for while lie was not really intoxicated,&#xD;
he had been a little merry, and even that&#xD;
was a rare thing for Lorenzo Monteagle.&#xD;
His employers were not Puritans, and&#xD;
consequently they observed nothing pe-&#xD;
culiar in his manner or appearance. Mr.&#xD;
Brown, however, was very sociable with&#xD;
Monteagle on that day, and the latter&#xD;
imagined that he knew the cause. He&#xD;
supposed that the young man was in a&#xD;
fair way to marry Julia, and accordingly&#xD;
the former rose in his estimation. Brown&#xD;
was one of those worthies who worship&#xD;
the rising sun. le as well as Blodget&#xD;
thought that Monteagle was 'a lucky&#xD;
dog.' Indeed, he would have been glad&#xD;
to be in his place. Monteagle saw into&#xD;
all this, but did not act as if he perceived&#xD;
it.&#xD;
In his hours of calm reflection, after&#xD;
dinner, Monteagle thought upon the&#xD;
eventsof the proceeding night, how he&#xD;
had twice been prevented from associat-&#xD;
ing with one of the seductive young girls&#xD;
at the houses of pleasure to which Blod-&#xD;
get had conveyed him.  In the first in-&#xD;
stance, a nun or something of the kind,&#xD;
had come to snatch Maria from his arms,&#xD;
-at the second house, the affray occur-&#xD;
red between the banker and the injured&#xD;
husband. But he had also had a singu-&#xD;
lar dream  during the night, which he&#xD;
had scarcely had time to think of during&#xD;
business. It now came up vividly to his&#xD;
recollection. The details were as follows:&#xD;
He seemed to be sitting with Julia Van-&#xD;
dewater, in her father's garden, in pleas-&#xD;

commanding a huge basin to be brought, had been on the point of forming when ho&#xD;

refreshing liquid, which restored all his feeling of disappointment which he expe-&#xD;
powers and filled him with unspeakable rienced convinced him that it would be no&#xD;
pleasure. Soft music floated around him&#xD;
&#xD;
easy matter to put his good resolution in&#xD;
practice.&#xD;
He slowly crawled over the hill toward&#xD;
the- house of Mr. Vandewater. When&#xD;
he sat down to supper with the family, he&#xD;
observed that Julia was in much better&#xD;
spirits than usual. Instead of regarding&#xD;
him with that heavy, mournful look that&#xD;
had been habitual to her for some months&#xD;
past, he caught'her in glancing covertly&#xD;
towards him several times, with spark-&#xD;
ling eyes and something like a glow of&#xD;
excitement on her cheeks.&#xD;
'Mr. Brown called this afternoon, I un-&#xD;
derstand,' remarked Vandewater in the&#xD;
course of conversation.&#xD;
'Yes, sir,' returned his lady ; 'he made&#xD;
himself very agreeable to your hopeful&#xD;
young lady here.'&#xD;
'Now aunt, you are provoking,' said&#xD;
Julia, with an ill-concealed smile of plea-&#xD;
sure. I was thinking if he was a jug&#xD;
what a fine handle his huge Roman nose&#xD;
would make.'&#xD;
Vandewater roared as usual on such&#xD;
occasions. Monteagle smiled. A thought,&#xD;
however, had instantly struck him.  He&#xD;
knew that Brown was a great talker, and&#xD;
like many great talkers, often said those&#xD;
things to his listeners which he thought&#xD;
would interest them rather than those&#xD;
things which were founded in fact. He&#xD;
imagined that in the glances which Ju-&#xD;
lia had given him, at the supper table,&#xD;
there was a look of triumph as well as&#xD;
pleasure. Could it be that Brown, know-&#xD;
ing Julia's secret, had made up a story&#xD;
about himself-had told her that Mont-&#xD;
eagle was truly in I we with her, but on-&#xD;
ly played shy for fear of the uncle ? Was&#xD;
it not quite possible that Brown had&#xD;
misunderstood the doctor ; and that he&#xD;
believed Vandewater was opposed to the&#xD;
match, and had advised his neice to&#xD;
&#xD;
conquer her passion on that account, in-&#xD;
stead of doing it because her passion was&#xD;
hopeless ?&#xD;
Nothing seemed more likely to Mont-&#xD;
eagle than this, especially as Blodget&#xD;
had so understood the matter, and Blod-&#xD;
get had received his information from&#xD;
t-Brown.   Besides, might not Brown&#xD;
have seen Blodget that day, and as the&#xD;
youth had become suddenly silent when&#xD;
the ' great secret' was told him, had not&#xD;
r Blodget interpreted this silence as des-&#xD;
pair of success and consequently melan-&#xD;
choly, and so reported it to Brown?7&#xD;
All that evening, Julia was extremely&#xD;
lively, and sometimes her aunt regarded&#xD;
her with surprise if not disapprobation,&#xD;
so piquant were her sallies and so point-&#xD;
ed was her ridicule.  Monteagle was&#xD;
more than.usually grave; not only from&#xD;
his want of sleep on the preceding night,&#xD;
but because he thought he had detected&#xD;
the source of Julia's gaiety, and the mis-&#xD;
take under which she labored.&#xD;
At length, when Monteaglo rose to&#xD;
retire, Julia contrived to place herself&#xD;
near the"'door, and as he went out, half&#xD;
asleep, and feeling very dull, she softly&#xD;
whispered the one word ' Hope !'  k&#xD;
Monteagle started as if struck by an&#xD;
arrow at this confirmation of his fears.&#xD;
The poor girl had mistaken his gravity&#xD;
and dullness for that despair which&#xD;
Brown had taught her to believe he was&#xD;
laboring under, and had ventured to tell&#xD;
him that he might hope I&#xD;
As Monteagle hurried off to his cham-&#xD;
ber, he knew not whether to laugh or&#xD;
cry.&#xD;
There was something very comic in&#xD;
this mistake. The blundering Brown,&#xD;
with his bi nose, getting hold of his&#xD;
story at the rong end, and hurrying off&#xD;

'Nothing is broken. The rascals must&#xD;
have had false keys,'&#xD;
'Rather true keys, than false ones,'&#xD;
replied iMonteagle, while Brown give a&#xD;
sudden start and slightly colored.&#xD;
' Ha ! ha ! Yes, true ones, or they&#xD;
would not have answered the purpose,'&#xD;
said the lattter.&#xD;
' Yet it is strange,' continued Mont-&#xD;
eagle, for the doors were otherwise secur-&#xD;
ed, as you know, Mr. Brown, by certain&#xD;
seeret fastenings which must have been&#xD;
broken before any one could have got&#xD;
in from the outside, unless he was well&#xD;
-acquainted with the premises.'&#xD;
' Oh, the Sydney ducks make them&#xD;
selves well acquainted with all these mat-&#xD;
ters,' cried Charley. 'All we have to do&#xD;
now is to trace out the villains'-&#xD;
' And begin by searching the police,'&#xD;
said Brown. ' Half the thefts and rob-&#xD;
beries are committed by them.'&#xD;
Mr. Vandewater arrived soon after,&#xD;
and was also surprised to find his store&#xD;
robbed without the rupture of a single&#xD;
fastening.  He advised an immediate&#xD;
search of the premises, as the robbers&#xD;
might have left something behind them&#xD;
that would have led to their detection.&#xD;
Some persons who had gone into the loft&#xD;
to search, soon came running down with&#xD;
the intelligence that a man was up stairs,&#xD;
fast asleep. All ran up at once, and&#xD;
there Monteagle discovered, between two&#xD;
bales, the bulky form of the Irishman,&#xD;
Jamie.   He was snoring melodiously,&#xD;
and seemed to have no idea that the sun&#xD;
was already up.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Vandewater uttered an exclama-&#xD;
tion of joy and surprise, for he thought&#xD;
discovery of the whole affair was now cer-&#xD;
tain.&#xD;
Monteagle shook the sleeping man&#xD;
with his foot. Jamie slowly opened his&#xD;
eyes, and on perceiving there were per-&#xD;
sons present, said hastily--' Ilow---what&#xD;
-is is time, Mr. Brown ? Is it time I'&#xD;
As Mr. Brown was not present, the&#xD;
by-standers were puzzled by these sin-&#xD;
gular words.&#xD;
' What do you want with Mr. Brown?'&#xD;
said Vandewater sternly.&#xD;
The Irishman rubbed his eyes, and&#xD;
perceiving in whose presence lie stood,&#xD;
answered,' Why, Jim Brown, to be sure,&#xD;
the eating-hojme man, he was to call mo&#xD;
up in time to go down the Bay.'&#xD;
' Indeed ! and so you slept here, did&#xD;
you ?' said Mr. i andewater sternly. -{But&#xD;
how did you get in?'&#xD;
'How did I get in. is it?  Och, and&#xD;
was n't I working for Jim all day, and&#xD;
took a little of the mountain dew, and&#xD;
comed in here in the afternoon-and&#xD;
where is it, sure, that I am ? Can you&#xD;
tell me at all, at all ?'&#xD;
' Who is this Jim Brown?' said Van-&#xD;
dewater turning to Charley. ' Can you&#xD;
lead me to him ?' asked Vandewater,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
' Och, faith, and it's I can do that,&#xD;
same,' put in Jamie. ' I'll take you to&#xD;
him, right off, jist, if you'll show the way&#xD;
out of this-what do yees call it ?  A&#xD;
church is it ?'&#xD;
The Irishman affected such blind stu-&#xD;
pidity that Vandewater was inclined to&#xD;
believe that his being in the store on&#xD;
the night of the robbery was altogether&#xD;
aeidental-that he had blundered in&#xD;
while drunk and got asleep. Neverthe-&#xD;

less, he said to Monteagle, 'Keep that&#xD;
fellow in custody till 1 return.'&#xD;
As Mr. Vandewater went out with&#xD;
Charley, he descried' Mr. Brown, his&#xD;
partner, t xamining the fastenings, and&#xD;
he observed that the face of the latter&#xD;
was very pale.&#xD;
'Poor fellow,' thought Vandewater to&#xD;
himself, he takes this matter hard.'&#xD;
On arriving at the shop of Jim Brown,&#xD;
that worthy was found at home, although&#xD;
he had just returned from some expedi-&#xD;
tion, and was covered with dust.&#xD;
Charley introduced Mr. Vandewater.&#xD;
Jim hung down his head a moment as&#xD;
if brushing the dirt from his leggings.&#xD;
' I want to ask you, Mr. Brown, if you&#xD;
have contemplated an excursion lately?'&#xD;
'Sir ?'said Jim with a stare.&#xD;
'He don't savez-give me leave, sir,'&#xD;
put in Charley. ' Jim, we want to:know&#xD;
if you have had any business out of&#xD;
town, lately?7&#xD;
Jim looked first at one and then the&#xD;
other. He was a little short rhan, with&#xD;
squint eyes, and locked as if he had not&#xD;
shaved in a month.&#xD;
' I goes sometimes to see my folks&#xD;
that I trade with. I was at a rancho&#xD;
yesterday.&#xD;
' How late did you stay, Jim?'&#xD;
' I am but just got home.'&#xD;
' What time did you start to go away?&#xD;
'1 didn't look at the clock,' replied&#xD;
Jim, in a surly manner.&#xD;
' Come as near as you can, Jim, and&#xD;
give us a true answer as you value the&#xD;
safety of your bacon,' said Charley stern-&#xD;
ly&#xD;
Jim looked up rather fiercely, but he&#xD;
saw that Charley was in earnest, and re-&#xD;
plied,,' Well,'I don't know what time it&#xD;
was It may be'twas eleven o'clock and&#xD;
may be it was only ten.'&#xD;
&#xD;
' And you have just returned V'&#xD;
' I told you so once before.'&#xD;
'So you did. When have you teen&#xD;
Irish Jamie, last V&#xD;
Jim lookod keenly at his interrogators&#xD;
before he replied,' Well, I can't rightly&#xD;
tell. Not in a fortnight, I should say&#xD;
p'raps, three weeks.'_&#xD;
'It's all a cock and a bull story, that&#xD;
of Jamie,' said Charley. ' You see there's&#xD;
no truth in it. Ho must be arrested.'-&#xD;
Jim Brown turned away his face and&#xD;
his manner was suspicious upon hearing&#xD;
these words.&#xD;
As Vandewater and Charley walked&#xD;
back to the store, the latter said.  'We&#xD;
must see the keeper of the rancho and&#xD;
find out from him if Jim Brown has been&#xD;
there.'&#xD;
' Why do you suspect this Brown of&#xD;
having been engaged in the robbery?'&#xD;
'It is strange,' said Charley, 'that the&#xD;
Irishman, before he had time to think,&#xD;
should have addressed Brown as one&#xD;
that had agreed to call him at a certain&#xD;
hour. We must make sure that Brown&#xD;
was at the rancho ; and if he was, a&#xD;
Philadelphia lawyer would be puzzled to&#xD;
account for Jamie's exclamation when&#xD;
starting out of a sound sleep,,and ex-&#xD;
pecting to fiad Brown at his side.'&#xD;
' True;'said Vandewater.&#xD;
' Leave it to me,' continued Charley.&#xD;
'I will find out what ranch Jim Brown&#xD;
visited yesterday. I will call there, and&#xD;
learn when he arrived, and when he left,&#xD;
if the fellow was there at all.'&#xD;
On returning to the store, they found&#xD;
Jamie standing outside the door, and&#xD;
surrounded by Monteagle, Mr. Brown&#xD;
and several of the, neighboring dealers.&#xD;
'So, sirrah,' said Vandewater, ' that&#xD;
Brown you spoke of, says that he hasn't&#xD;
seen you for a fortnight, and he has just&#xD;
&#xD;
returned from visiting a friend out of the;&#xD;
town.'&#xD;
'Och, the lying villain,' exclaimed&#xD;
Jamie, in a tone of virtuous indignation.&#xD;
'Och, the lying, thaving, murthering&#xD;
scoundrel, and wasn't it his own silf that&#xD;
tould me to go into the store and take a&#xD;
nap till mornin', and  '&#xD;
He was interrupted-by the appearance&#xD;
of Jim Brown himself, who rushed into&#xD;
the crowd, and confronting Jamie, cried&#xD;
'How's this ?  What have you been tel-&#xD;
ling about me '&#xD;
'About you, is it?' cried Jamie, with&#xD;
all the assurance imaginable, 'and is it.&#xD;
you. you thafe o' the w-o-r-r-r-1-d, that's&#xD;
come to lie me down, and try to hang'&#xD;
his friend widout judge or jury, and&#xD;
widout binifit of clargy, too. Och, you&#xD;
thunderin' wilyun! didn't you tell me to&#xD;
go in here, and slape a bit, just till the&#xD;
morning, when you was to call me up,&#xD;
sure ?'&#xD;
'Sir,' said Jim Brown, addressing Van-&#xD;
dewater, ' When you called at my shop,&#xD;
I didn't understand your object, and as&#xD;
your questions seemed very odd, I wasn't&#xD;
well' pleased with them; but I've been&#xD;
told since that this man pretends I had&#xD;
an engagement with him. It is a lie.&#xD;
I've no intercourse with the man when I&#xD;
can help it.'&#xD;
' Hear the lying thafe,' cried Jamie, in&#xD;
a towering passion, and before he could&#xD;
be prevented, he had slipped a long&#xD;
knife out of his sleeve, with which he&#xD;
rushed upon Jim Brown and stabbed him&#xD;
to the heart.&#xD;
Brown fell dead at the feet of Mont-&#xD;
eagle. The murder was committed so&#xD;
quick and unexpectedly that it was some&#xD;
minutes before the people collected there&#xD;
were apprized of what had happened !&#xD;
No sooner had the sad tale been told&#xD;
&#xD;
than the inhabitants came running in&#xD;
from all directions ; a large mob was&#xD;
collected, a rope procured, and it was&#xD;
with great difficulty that Charley and&#xD;
his aids could prevent the populace from&#xD;
hanging up Jamie on the spot.&#xD;
Mr. Brown also tried bard to rescue&#xD;
Jamie from the fangs of the incensed&#xD;
and vindictive crowd.&#xD;
'Let the law take its proper course 1'&#xD;
vociferated he, while Jamie kept crying,&#xD;
'Och now, be aisy, you spalpeens--for&#xD;
there's more nor me you'll have to hang,&#xD;
when yees once begins that game, and&#xD;
some that's your betters, too, and as&#xD;
good as'-&#xD;
'Let the law take its course 1' roared&#xD;
Mr. Brown, so loudly as to drown the&#xD;
voice of the Irishman. ''ake him away,&#xD;
Charley, as soon as possible.  See what&#xD;
a crowd is collecting around her. I'm&#xD;
afraid of a riot.&#xD;
Jamie was finally carried down the&#xD;
street, in the centre of a tumultuous mob,&#xD;
some pushing one way, and some an-&#xD;
other, with fierce hootings, yells, and&#xD;
hisses, that were fairly deafening.&#xD;
A singular impression was left upon&#xD;
the mind of Monteagle by these proceed-&#xD;
ings, and he commenced the business of&#xD;
the day with a determination to watch&#xD;
closely every thing which was transpiring&#xD;
near him, and to propose to MN. Vande-&#xD;
water that, in future, some person should&#xD;
sleep in the store every night.&#xD;
Jamie, who had at length, completed&#xD;
the circle of crime by the conmnitting of&#xD;
murder, was lodged in prison, and Mont-&#xD;
eagle felt somewhat relieved on account&#xD;
of it, as he believed that the man was&#xD;
for some reason, his deadly enemy. lie&#xD;
had not yet recognized this man as the&#xD;
one who shot him down in the barge.&#xD;

Monteagle, and appeared to be more af-&#xD;
fable than ever, talked with him about&#xD;
the robbery and made very minute en-&#xD;
quiries about Jamie, whom he thought&#xD;
innocent of any intent to rob.&#xD;
'It is not possible that a man bent on.&#xD;
robbery should lie down and get to sleep&#xD;
in the store, or that he should be left by&#xD;
his accomplices,' said Blodget;' and with&#xD;
regard to his stupid lie about Brown, the&#xD;
man whom he killed, it was probably&#xD;
told because he did not know anything&#xD;
else to say.'&#xD;
'But,' replied Monteagle, 'in that case&#xD;
why did he address somebody as Brown&#xD;
when 'first starting from his sleep, and&#xD;
before he had time for premeditation ?'&#xD;
' There is something in that,' said&#xD;
Blodget, fixing his eyes very keenly upon&#xD;
those of Monteagle. 'It would seem as&#xD;
if he expected to be called at a certain&#xD;
hour by this Brown.'&#xD;
'And why should he have been work-&#xD;
ed up to such a pitch of madness as to&#xD;
murder this Brown, if he did not feel&#xD;
that he was playing him false-'&#xD;
'No-,no-Monteagle. You are reas-&#xD;
oning for civilized people now. You&#xD;
don't know these wild, unscrupulous fel-&#xD;
lows, who like Jamie had prowled about&#xD;
in the wilderness where-no moral or re-&#xD;
ligious instruction can reach them. I&#xD;
tell you that a man left wild, a prey to&#xD;
passions, is more to be feared than the&#xD;
tiger or the catamount.'&#xD;
'You seem to think very hard of this&#xD;
Irishman,' said Monteagle.&#xD;
'Is he not a murderer ?'&#xD;
The youth. was silent.  Many things&#xD;
rushed upon his rememberance, and all&#xD;
through there -as running a thread of&#xD;
mystery which induced him to say to&#xD;
himself, ' How little do you -know of&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Ruined Nun--The Mysterious&#xD;
Note.&#xD;
THAT evening Monteagle accompanied&#xD;
Blodget to one of those gay houses in&#xD;
Dupont street, already mentioned.&#xD;
Wit, wine, and beauty sparkled on&#xD;
every side, and- again was the imagina-&#xD;
tion of Monteagle bewildered by the&#xD;
transcendent loveliness of Italian, Eng-&#xD;
lish, North American and South Ameri-&#xD;
can beauties, who, although' accounted'&#xD;
frail daughters of Eve, were a much&#xD;
more intellectual, sentimental, and edu-&#xD;
cated class than is to be found in the&#xD;
halls of pleasure in any of the older&#xD;
cities.&#xD;
While Blodget and Monteagle were&#xD;
thus spending the evening in converse&#xD;
with the nymphs of the town, the latter&#xD;
several times observed Blodget to pause&#xD;
a moment, and sit with lips apart and&#xD;
absent eye, as if listening for some sound&#xD;
in the street.&#xD;
He was under the impression that&#xD;
Blodget looked forthe arrival of some&#xD;
'other person. At length a confused&#xD;
murmur was heard as of a crowd at a&#xD;
distance. The sound approached nearer,&#xD;
and atilength, in full cry, burst upon the&#xD;
air, such exclamations as ' Stop him I stop&#xD;
thief! Broke away ! There he .goes&#xD;
Knock him down,' and this was followed&#xD;
by the discharge of fire-arms, and then&#xD;
came the trampling of many feet, and a&#xD;
confused roar as of a mighty concourse&#xD;
in motion.&#xD;
Every one in the house flew to the&#xD;
windows and doors; but nothing was&#xD;
to be seen except a crowd of people hur-&#xD;
rying along with loud outcries.&#xD;
&#xD;

OF SAN&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
'What is the matter?' inquired Mont-&#xD;
eagle of a person whom he knew, and&#xD;
who just then paused opposite the win-&#xD;
dow.&#xD;
'Oh, nothing much, sir,' was the care-&#xD;
less reply. ' A fellow confined for mur-&#xD;
der has broken loose ; but that we shall&#xD;
always have while such a police exists.'&#xD;
' There 's next to no lair in San Fran-&#xD;
cisco,' observed Blodget, ' but do you&#xD;
think, my good man, that the .Irishman,&#xD;
-that the prisoner-will get clear?'&#xD;
'I don't know,' said the other, moving-&#xD;
on, while Monteagle quickly said, 'So,&#xD;
you think it's Jamie?'&#xD;
'Who else can it be t' said Blodget,&#xD;
'he is the man who has been arrested&#xD;
for murder/&#xD;
' Of course,' returned the youth, and&#xD;
yet he thought it strange that Bledget&#xD;
had hesitated when he first mentioned&#xD;
the Irishman, and he connected it with&#xD;
the fact that Blodget had seemed to be&#xD;
listening all the evening as if in anticipa-&#xD;
tion of some such occurrence.&#xD;
These reflections were, however, soon&#xD;
swallowed up by the gay conversation&#xD;
that succeeded, and the pleasures of&#xD;
wine, music, and an interchange of senti-&#xD;
ments with beings who, if virtuous, would&#xD;
have graced any drawing-room in the&#xD;
country. Still Monteagle was occasion-&#xD;
ally drawn to the contemplation of his&#xD;
friend who seemed quite restless and&#xD;
listened to every noise in the street.&#xD;
Monteagle had attached himself to an&#xD;
Italian girl, who might be nineteen years&#xD;
of age.  Round and plump-with black&#xD;
amorous eyes and good teeth,she seemed&#xD;
to be all alive, and wholly made up of&#xD;
kindness and affection.&#xD;
Her history was somewhat romauntic.&#xD;
as Monteagle learned it from another of&#xD;
the inmates of. the house. She ws called&#xD;
&#xD;
FRANCISCO.                         49&#xD;
Loretto, but whether a real or a feigned&#xD;
name was not known. She had taken&#xD;
the vows of a nun from the purest and&#xD;
most sincere motives, but after being&#xD;
two years in the convent, she found it&#xD;
impossible to fulfil her vows.  She was&#xD;
naturally formed for love, and could no&#xD;
longer endure to exist without yielding'&#xD;
to the demands of an ardent nature, in-&#xD;
flamed by a continual contemplation of&#xD;
imaginary love scenes, which always&#xD;
presented themselves to her mind when&#xD;
she would ponder upon more sacred mat-&#xD;
ters.&#xD;
She made her escape from the convent&#xD;
and returned to her father's house ; but&#xD;
found no rest under the paternal roof-&#xD;
Her parents upbraided her, and were pro-&#xD;
cbeding to have her returned to the con-&#xD;
vent, when she pretended to go to her&#xD;
chamber for repose. She escaped by the&#xD;
window, and as she fled through the gar-&#xD;
den she met a handsome young English-&#xD;
man to whom she at once told her story.&#xD;
He took her under his protection, with-&#xD;
out the least hesitation, and they lived&#xD;
tegether, in a retired part of the country&#xD;
several weeks. This young man was of&#xD;
a warm temperament, and here comes the&#xD;
strangest part of the story. He was so&#xD;
smitten by her charms that they upset his&#xD;
reason, and he went raving mad. Though&#xD;
she was actually at his disposal, he im-&#xD;
agined that she was some great princess&#xD;
whose love he had sought in vain, and&#xD;
under this strange belief, he, one day&#xD;
threw himself from a cliff into a bed of&#xD;
rocks on the sea-shore and was killed.-&#xD;
She took possession of his mangled body&#xD;
and his effects, found out his friends and&#xD;
delivered them into their hands.&#xD;
She mourned long and bitterly for the&#xD;
loss of her lover ; but her passionate na-&#xD;
ture again prevailed, and she accepted&#xD;

the offers of a native Count, who was&#xD;
soon-killed in a quarrel.&#xD;
Believing that a fatality attended her&#xD;
in her own land, and learning that spies h&#xD;
had been placed upon her actions by her si&#xD;
relatives, she came to Brazil, and from&#xD;
thence, soon afterwards..to San Francis- ii&#xD;
Co. Such was Loretto, the Italian maid,&#xD;
whose fervid passions were kindled by s&#xD;
the manly graces of Monteagle.&#xD;
She appeared to be all life and soul, f&#xD;
and she made a lively impression upon P&#xD;
our youth.1&#xD;
As the evening waned, and while he t&#xD;
sat conversing with Loretto, Monteaglea&#xD;
heard three distinct, though very lows&#xD;
)aps, on the outer door. At the same&#xD;
time, he saw Blodget raise his head and&#xD;
listen. Then he conducted himself as if&#xD;
nothing had happened, and conversed&#xD;
carelessly with the woman to whom he&#xD;
had attached himself. But in a very few&#xD;
moments, he arose and whispering in the&#xD;
ear of Monteagle, said-' I must quit you&#xD;
for a little while. I have forgotten some-&#xD;
thing : but I will return before long.'&#xD;
Blodge~t then departed and soon after-&#xD;
wards, Mouteagle withdrew with Loret-&#xD;
to. He saw no more of Blodget on that&#xD;
night. In the morning, he learned that&#xD;
Jamie, the murderer, had made good his&#xD;
escape in a somewhat mysterious manner.&#xD;
He had disappeared behind the sand-hills&#xD;
although surrounded by several hundred'&#xD;
men.&#xD;
The earth must have opened and&#xD;
swallowed him up,' said Mr. Brown, the&#xD;
junior partner.&#xD;
I think that he was not the robber of&#xD;
our store,' said Mr Vandewater, thought-&#xD;
- fully, "for he would scarcely have remain-&#xD;
ed here all night, if he had shared in the&#xD;
booty.'&#xD;

'What could have been his errand,&#xD;
aid Brown.&#xD;
' The fellow might have blundered in&#xD;
ere, in a fit of intoxication and gone to&#xD;
sleep ' said Monteagle.&#xD;
'But why did he kill that tripeman 1'&#xD;
inquired Mr Yandewater.&#xD;
'Oh, the fellow wouldkill anybody,'&#xD;
aid Monteagle.&#xD;
Mr. Brown looked very mysterious, and&#xD;
inally seeming to muster up courage, he&#xD;
pulled a note from his pocket, and said to,&#xD;
Monteagle--'Perhaps you- can tell why&#xD;
his note addressed to you was picked up&#xD;
on the very spot where the murderer was.&#xD;
leaping.'&#xD;
' How I' cried Vandewater. ' What's&#xD;
n the note?'&#xD;
' I have not taken the liberty to break&#xD;
the seal,' returned Brown. 'Its contents&#xD;
will be known to Mr. Monteagle whenev-&#xD;
er he chooses to do so.'&#xD;
Brown handed the note to Monteagle,&#xD;
It was written on fine, gilt-edged paper,&#xD;
and directed to " Mr. Lorenzo Monteagle,&#xD;
Montgomery street."&#xD;
The astonished youth broke the seal,&#xD;
and opened the note. On the top -was&#xD;
marked " Strictly Private."  It read&#xD;
thus&#xD;
' Dear Sir: You may think it strange&#xD;
that you and I were seperated so sudden-&#xD;
ly on that evening in Dupont street; but&#xD;
a particular friend of mine was the cause,&#xD;
as you saw. If you are at liberty this&#xD;
evening call without fail to see me, but&#xD;
not at that house. You know the cliff&#xD;
near which lies the English barque St.&#xD;
George. I will be under that cliff, on the .&#xD;
sea-shore at 8 o'clock precisely. This is&#xD;
very private. Let no one she it. It is&#xD;
sent by a man who will hand it to you,&#xD;
privately if he has an opportunity. Come&#xD;
if you can.                MARiA-,'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Ah -it is too late!' said Monteagl&#xD;
aloud, and putting the note into hi&#xD;
pocket.&#xD;
'It would seem that we are not to bl&#xD;
edified by the contents of your note,' sai&#xD;
Mr. Brown, looking at Vandewater.&#xD;
' What shall I do,' said the youth t&#xD;
himself. ' This is something important&#xD;
without doubt.'&#xD;
' Private. is it not?' inquired Vande-&#xD;
water.&#xD;
' Sir!' said Monteagle, rather surpris&#xD;
ed at the question.&#xD;
'You must know that this is a peculiar&#xD;
occasion,' said Mr. Brown, rightly inter&#xD;
preting Monteagle's surprise. 'At an-&#xD;
ro the time, it would be highly imprope&#xD;
to express any curiosity with regard to&#xD;
the purport of that note.&#xD;
' This note is nothing,' said the youth.&#xD;
'It is strictly confidential and has no&#xD;
relation to the robbery whatever.,&#xD;
Vandewater looked at Mr. Brown, and&#xD;
the latter raised his eye-brows and slow-s&#xD;
ly shook his head. The grimace was not&#xD;
observed by Monteagle, whose thoug ats&#xD;
were with the young lady beneath the&#xD;
cliff.&#xD;
' You will observe, Mr. Monteagle,'&#xD;
said Brown, in a very gentle and yet&#xD;
distinct tone, 'that a heavy robbery has&#xD;
been committee. An atrocious male-&#xD;
factor is found asleep in the store that&#xD;
has been robbed ; a letter, evidently&#xD;
dropped by him tears your address up-&#xD;
on its back. If he is taken and brought&#xD;
to trial, of course that letter will be need-&#xD;
ed.'&#xD;
' So far I can satisfy your curiosity,'&#xD;
said Monteagle. ' It appears that Jamie&#xD;
was employed as messenger to bring me&#xD;
this letter. It is probable that he came&#xD;
here drunk and fell asleep .&#xD;
'That seems to account fully for the&#xD;

dewater.&#xD;
e    Brown compressed   his lips, partly&#xD;
d nodded, partly shook his head, raised his&#xD;
eye-brows, and turned away, like a man&#xD;
o who is only half convinced, and who has&#xD;
made some discovery that he hesitates&#xD;
to unfold.&#xD;
At supper that evening, Julia Vande-&#xD;
water was aA gracious as usual; but when&#xD;
he arose to go abroad, she said to him&#xD;
as he passed the door, 'You keep very&#xD;
late hours, Sir Lorenzo; I must take&#xD;
you in charge, myself.'&#xD;
Although this was said in a tone of&#xD;
raillery, yet there was the slightest pos-&#xD;
sible air of reproof in it, enough to make&#xD;
Monteagle feel that the deluded girl con-&#xD;
sidered herself entitled to express an&#xD;
opinion upon his conduct.&#xD;
As he travelled over the hills towards&#xD;
the town, the youth said to himself--&#xD;
Would it be more cruel to break this&#xD;
bubble at once, or suffer it to collapse&#xD;
of itself in due time ? Surely a flame&#xD;
that is never fed won't burn long, and I&#xD;
have given Julia not the least reason to&#xD;
suppose that I regarded her with par-&#xD;
tiality.'&#xD;
He had arrived at a thick clump of&#xD;
bushes, at a considerable distance from&#xD;
any house though a small rancho was in&#xD;
plain sight, when he heard something-stir&#xD;
among the leaves and branches. He&#xD;
drew out his revolver.&#xD;
' Will you shoot me7' inquired a sil-&#xD;
ver voice, and in another moment, Maria&#xD;
stood before him.&#xD;

great things. I wanted to see you.'&#xD;
The youth laid his hand on her shoul-&#xD;
der kindly.&#xD;
' No'-said she-" You don't under&#xD;
stand. 'All you, gentlemens, think girl&#xD;
love you always. Nothing to do but&#xD;
love man, when man laugh at her,' and&#xD;
she shook her-locks independently.&#xD;
'But I am glad to see you at any&#xD;
rate,' said Monteagle.&#xD;
'Oh, yes, you are very glad to see m&#xD;
-some--but you are more glad to see&#xD;
' Whom?'&#xD;
'You know best.'&#xD;
Monteagle thought of Loretto, whos&#xD;
witching graces and rich personal charm&#xD;
had, indeed, wrought powerfully upo&#xD;
his imagination.&#xD;
'Come tell me where she lives,' rai&#xD;
he.&#xD;
You have just come from there,' r&#xD;
turned Maria.&#xD;
'No, upon my honor, I have not bee&#xD;
there since last night.'&#xD;
Maria started, and her eyes shot&#xD;
brilliantly as she gazed into his face.&#xD;
'Not been home to-day ?' cried she.&#xD;
'Ah, yes, I have just eome from ti&#xD;
house of Mr. Vandewater.'&#xD;
' And who lives there?' inquired sh&#xD;
fixing her eyes keenly on the fuce of t&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
' Mr. and Mrs. Vandewater, their niece&#xD;
and the servants,' replied he.&#xD;
' The niece! the nice !' cried Maria.&#xD;
'What of her ?'&#xD;
'A very fine young lady, I believe.'&#xD;
' Very fine!? Yes, very fine-you find&#xD;
her so?  Very fine.'&#xD;
' Maria,' said he, in a decisive tone, 'it'&#xD;
you have been told that I love Julia Van.&#xD;
dewater, or-th4  I have ever given her&#xD;
the least reason to suspect so, you have&#xD;
been told a downright falsehood.'&#xD;
You not love Julia?  No?   Nota&#xD;
little bit?' and she sized his hand anal&#xD;
gazed into his face earnestly.&#xD;
'No, Maria, I do not love her.'&#xD;
Maria was silent, and looked much&#xD;
t puzzled.   She trotted her foot; she&#xD;
looked at Monteagle, and then she fixed&#xD;
her gaze upon the ground for several&#xD;
y minutes.&#xD;
Suddenly lifting her head, she said&#xD;
e to Monteagle in a brisk tone, 'You tell&#xD;
0' me one very big lie'&#xD;
'No, upon my honor.'&#xD;
After a moment's silence, she said,&#xD;
e 'Where you have been last night?'&#xD;
s   'I can't tell you that, Maria.'&#xD;
n    ' Ah! Ifind you out.  You love one&#xD;
pretty lady: you see her last night, and&#xD;
d you say I not tell you where I go las&#xD;
night.'-&#xD;
e.   'No, Maria, I have answered one of&#xD;
your questions; but cannot answer the&#xD;
other.'&#xD;
Maria looked down, and breathed a&#xD;
e deep sigh.&#xD;
Monteagle's pride was a little touched.&#xD;
He said, ' I-do not know that I shall ever&#xD;
he i mary, Maria. But if I happened to&#xD;
fall in with a congenial spirit-a virtu-&#xD;
le, ous, chaste, respectable . girl, I don't&#xD;
he know what might happen.&#xD;
Maria threw back her head, shook her&#xD;
&#xD;
raven tresses fiercely, and her nostrils&#xD;
dilated as she answered-'What thing&#xD;
is men ! they think of nobody but him-&#xD;
self. Woman got soul for somebody be-&#xD;
sides herself,' and she struck her breast&#xD;
forcibly, so much so that Monteagle&#xD;
heard a dagger rattle in its scabbard.&#xD;
' Oh, yes, Maria, I have feeling for&#xD;
others,' returned Monteagle. ' I have&#xD;
feeling for you, and although I may not&#xD;
wish to marry you'&#xD;
The girl whirled completely round on&#xD;
one foot, and interrupted Monteagle by&#xD;
a shout of laughter that might have&#xD;
roused the inmates of the distant ranch.&#xD;
He looked at her surprised. Scarcely&#xD;
deigning him a glance, she began again,&#xD;
and laughed till her breath failed her.&#xD;
' Man is so fool!' said she at length.&#xD;
' Here,' she continued, taking a string of&#xD;
costly pearls from some place where they&#xD;
had been concealed about her person,&#xD;
and laying them on his hand.   'You&#xD;
think that poor Maria give you these ?&#xD;
You think I buy?'&#xD;
Monteagle examined the precious gift&#xD;
by the twilight, and perceived that it&#xD;
was. indeed, too magnificent to have&#xD;
come from the poor nymph, and that it&#xD;
must be a gift from some unknown in-&#xD;
dividual.&#xD;
He perceived the drift of Maria's ques-&#xD;
tionings. He believed that this was the&#xD;
gift of some wealthy lady who was kind-&#xD;
ly disposed towards him; and that Maria&#xD;
had been commissioned to sound him on&#xD;
the subject of his reported attachment to&#xD;
Julia.&#xD;
Here was an adventure, indeed, and&#xD;
his imagination was at once set on fire.&#xD;
- Tell me, Maria, the name of the la-&#xD;
dy ?'&#xD;
'What lady?'&#xD;
' The lady who sent me these pearls'&#xD;
&#xD;
'A  Lady-ha ! ha! ha! It was not&#xD;
a lady. It was one big gentleman.'&#xD;
Monteagle's vanity fell ninety degrees,&#xD;
at hearing these words.&#xD;
'Who was the gentleman  1' inquired&#xD;
he, impatiently&#xD;
'Who is your lady that you saw last&#xD;
night ?' questioned the wilful girl.&#xD;
'Oh, nobody-nothing at all. No-&#xD;
body that I shall ever fall in love with&#xD;
I promise you that.'&#xD;
'Not fall in love? Where you go to.&#xD;
night ?'&#xD;
Monteagle smiled at this close ques-&#xD;
tion, for he felt a little caught He was&#xD;
bound to Loretto when he met Maria.&#xD;
The girl turned and began to leave him.&#xD;
'Stop, Maria, tell me more about these&#xD;
pearls. Who is the gentleman who sent&#xD;
them to me ?'&#xD;
Who is the lady you see last night&#xD;
and go to see to-night too?' demanded&#xD;
she retreating.&#xD;
Monteagle pursued, when she quicken-&#xD;
ed her pace and finally fled with the fleet.&#xD;
ness of a fawn. Not caring to be seen&#xD;
chasing a woman by several travellers,&#xD;
whom he had observed coming that way,&#xD;
Monteagle slackened his pace. Maria&#xD;
was soon out of sight, and Monteagle&#xD;
was besieged by a thousand ideas at once.&#xD;
'She tells me that this valuable gift&#xD;
came from a man--a wealthy nabob-and&#xD;
yet she enquires as closely into the state&#xD;
of my heart as if she was the agent of&#xD;
one of her own sex who had an interest&#xD;
in knowing whether I was in love with&#xD;
Julia Vandewater or not. At any rate,&#xD;

had been made to deprive him of the lit-&#xD;

Another person now joined the party,&#xD;
and he heard the three in low and appa-&#xD;
rently earnest consultation. Soon they&#xD;
ceased talking, and approached him...-&#xD;
Two of them raised him to his feet, and&#xD;
one- of them said in a rough, brutal tone,&#xD;
'Now, stir your stumps, and walk where&#xD;
we lead you.'&#xD;
But how if I refuse to walk?' said&#xD;
Monteagle.&#xD;
' Then we'll take you by the neck and&#xD;
drag you over the beach, if the sharp&#xD;
stones scrape the flesh from your cursed&#xD;
bones.'&#xD;
Release me ; or my cries shall bring&#xD;
assistance,' said Monteagle, resolutely.&#xD;
'Speak one loud word, and the con-&#xD;
tents of this crash through your scull,'&#xD;
said the last comer, in a firm calm voice,&#xD;
and our hero felt the cold muzzle of a re-&#xD;
volver pressed against his temple, and at&#xD;
the same instant the sharp click announ-&#xD;
ced it was at full cock.&#xD;
Monteagle had as brave a heart as ever&#xD;
beat in mortal bosom ; but here was a&#xD;
dilemma that. would have made even&#xD;
Jack Hays pause for reflection.&#xD;
But little time was given Monteagle&#xD;
for thought.&#xD;
'D-n,' cried one of his captors, impa-&#xD;
patiently, let's be moving. We've got a&#xD;
long road, and a heavy night's work be-&#xD;
fore us yet.'&#xD;
'By-, your right, old boss,' said&#xD;
one of them, 'there's been fooling enough&#xD;
already.'&#xD;
So saying, he seized Monteagle by the.&#xD;
collar with no gentle grasp.&#xD;
The latter seeing that resistance would&#xD;
only lead to his being dragged along by&#xD;
main force, if not to his instant death,&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
told them to unbind him, and he would&#xD;
walk peaceably along with them.&#xD;
' That's right, youngster, you'll save&#xD;
us the price of a couple of bullets, and&#xD;
the trouble of reloading,' said the fellow&#xD;
with the revolver.&#xD;
After proceeding alongside the beach&#xD;
for some hundred yards, they clambered&#xD;
up the almost perpendicular face of the&#xD;
cuff, by the assistance of the dwarf trees&#xD;
and jutting rocks. Monteagle being aid-&#xD;
ed by two of the men, who each held one&#xD;
his arms.&#xD;
Before gaining the summit of the cliff,&#xD;
one of the party gave a low, peculiar&#xD;
whistle, somewhat like the cry of a cur-&#xD;
lew. It was immediately responded to&#xD;
and they set out in the direction from&#xD;
whence proceeded what was evidently&#xD;
the pre-concerted signal.&#xD;
'All right, Jimmy,' said one of Mont-&#xD;

'The divil a bit of noise I hear, I heard&#xD;

'Come, come, let's mount and be off.'&#xD;
This order was given by a voice which&#xD;
Monteagle recognised as that of the man&#xD;
who placed the pistol at his head, and&#xD;
who appeared to be the leader of the&#xD;
gang.&#xD;

&#xD;
piness, as they have always been of open-&#xD;
hearted hospitality.&#xD;
Half an hour's more riding brought&#xD;
them to the place of their destination. It&#xD;
was a rude hut or cabin, such as ' squat-&#xD;
ters' put up when taking possession-&#xD;
peaceably if they can, forcibly if they&#xD;
must. This hut was erected at the bot-&#xD;
'torn of a deep dell, surrounded on all&#xD;
sides by hills so abrupt that they were&#xD;
forced to leave the horses tied above,&#xD;
while they made the descent on foot.&#xD;
Both externally and internally this&#xD;
looked like the ordinary abode of a new&#xD;
settler  But no sooner had the gang&#xD;
entered with their prisoner, than a light&#xD;
was procured, and one of the party,&#xD;
moving a mattress, lifted a trap door&#xD;
that gave entrance to a subterraneous&#xD;
apartment of some extent. It was pro-&#xD;
bably a natural cavern, the entrance to&#xD;
which had been accidentally discovered&#xD;
by these desperadoes. Its isolated sit-&#xD;
uation suggested its usefulness to them&#xD;
as a secret place of rendezvous, and a re-&#xD;
ceptacle for plunder. One of them had&#xD;
ac-lordingly squatted on the place and&#xD;
put up the hut.&#xD;
Monteagle was handed down into this&#xD;
apartment, his eyes fill blindfolded-&#xD;
but te close, damp air informed his&#xD;
senses that he was in an underground&#xD;
apartment of some kind. The more he&#xD;
reflected the more he became mystified&#xD;
in his endeavors to ascertain the mo-&#xD;
tives that had prompted these ruffians to&#xD;
take him prisoner in this most unac-&#xD;
countable manner. He had-recognized&#xD;
the voice of the man called ' Jimmy' as&#xD;
that of the villian found asleep in Van-&#xD;
dewater's store, and who had been ar-&#xD;
rested for murder, and afterwards escap-&#xD;
ed from justice. But this discovery did&#xD;
not explain why he had been thus kid-&#xD;
&#xD;
napped. His suspense was, however,&#xD;
soon ended, as shall presently be shown.&#xD;
The cavern was of large dimensions,&#xD;
yet was more than half filled with silks,&#xD;
broadeloths, laces, and velvets of the&#xD;
costliest descriptions piled promiscuous-&#xD;
ly together. Upon these heaps lay gob-&#xD;
lets, salvers and ladles of gold and silver&#xD;
ware, some showing signs of use, but&#xD;
most appearing bright and untarnished&#xD;
as when they glittered on the jeweller's&#xD;
shelves. These things were evidently&#xD;
the result of successful, robberies and&#xD;
explained why the neighboring city had&#xD;
been swept by so many conflagrations.&#xD;
In one corner of the cavern a small,&#xD;
thin, sharp-visaged man  bent over a&#xD;
large crucible, the flickering flames be-&#xD;
neath which shed a red glow upon his&#xD;
swarthy, anxious countenance. At the&#xD;
first glance this individual might have&#xD;
been mistaken for one of those alcher.-&#xD;
iets who, in the dark ages, sought to&#xD;
transmute the baser metals into gold,&#xD;
or discover an elixir that would give&#xD;
to mortal man eternal vigor and immor-&#xD;
tal youth. He of the crucible was en-&#xD;
gaged in no such visionary employment.&#xD;
Beside him stood dies and other mech-&#xD;
anical contrivances for the manufacture&#xD;
of coin, while a large box full of glitter-&#xD;
ing 'octagons' showed that he was busy&#xD;
augmenting the currency,' by fabricat-&#xD;
ing spurious 'slugs.'&#xD;
Monteagle now once more demanded&#xD;
the cause of his detention.&#xD;
' Your employer, Vandewater, lately&#xD;
sold a vessel on account of a New York&#xD;
merchant, for thirty thousand dollars,&#xD;
which sum he received in gold. That&#xD;
money was placed in your safe-'&#xD;
'Then you are the robbers!'&#xD;
' Silence, and listen ! When we open-&#xD;

heavy sigh.                          said Jimmy, quite fiercely.&#xD;
Again his heartless tormentor gave  'That' Saserac' brandy has awakened&#xD;
&#xD;
Jimmy's religious feelings.  But, come,&#xD;
come-there's been too much of this&#xD;
fooling. Maretzo, if you can make this&#xD;
stubborn devil talk, do so at once !'&#xD;
Maretzo  made some    arrangements&#xD;
%bout his furnace, and joined the party&#xD;
gathered around Monteagle-who still&#xD;
lay, bound and blind-folded, upon the&#xD;
dungeon floor.&#xD;
The Italian then took up a piece of&#xD;
linen from one of the piles of dry goods,&#xD;
and placed it smoothly and tightly over&#xD;
Monteagle's lips and nostrils. He then&#xD;
took a glass of water, and poured a few&#xD;
drops upon the linen.  The poor youth&#xD;
could draw breath with difficulty through&#xD;
the dry linen, but when its threads be-&#xD;
came swollen by absorbing the water&#xD;
his respiration was almost entirely pre-&#xD;
vented. His breast heaved by involun-&#xD;
tary muscular expansion-great drops&#xD;
of sweat started from every pore, while&#xD;
the veins of his neck and forehead grew&#xD;
swoln and purple- It required the unit-&#xD;
ed force of all the scoundrels that sur-&#xD;
rounded him to retain his writhing body&#xD;
on the earth.&#xD;
Poor Monteagle's convulsive and spas-&#xD;
modic efforts, however, soon subsided,&#xD;
and it appeared as if his tormentors had&#xD;
gone too far, and that death had stepped&#xD;
in and snatched their helpless victim&#xD;
from further cruelties.&#xD;
Maretzo removed the cloth, and after&#xD;
a few heavy and painful attempts at&#xD;
breathing, Monteagle's low groans and&#xD;
sighs told how dreadful had been his suf-&#xD;
ferings.-&#xD;
'Now, G-d d--n your stubborn soul&#xD;
will you tell us where to find the money,'&#xD;
said Blodget.&#xD;
Heavy, deep-drawn sighs, were the&#xD;
poor youth's sole reply.&#xD;
'Give him another dose,' said one of&#xD;
&#xD;
the heartless ruffians, ' he likes the med-&#xD;
icine so well.'&#xD;
At this instant the trap door was&#xD;
lifted, and one of the gang, who had&#xD;
been stationed on the neighboring bill as&#xD;
a look-out, cried:&#xD;
'I see a party of horsemen making&#xD;
right for the hut, at full gallop. Wo&#xD;
must have been followed. Let's be off,&#xD;
at once, or we 're sure to be taken !'&#xD;
' Sure an' let's have a brush wid 'em,'&#xD;
said Jimmy.&#xD;
'Never fight till you're obliged to,'&#xD;
said Blodget.&#xD;
' Lay hold of this fellow,' said Maret-&#xD;
zo, 'and carry him to a horse, then let's&#xD;
all start down towards the Heads.   I&#xD;
know of a cave there, that has never&#xD;
had any dwellers except seals. There&#xD;
we can keep this youth, and wring the&#xD;
secret from him, or, failing that, put him&#xD;
where he '11 tell no tales.'&#xD;
No more words were wasted ; this&#xD;
striking the whole party a3 the best plan&#xD;
they could pursue under the circumstan-&#xD;
ces. Accordingly, a couple of men seiz-&#xD;

the summit of the acclivity where the&#xD;
horses were tethered. The rest of the&#xD;
party followed, bearing with then all&#xD;
the most valuable and portable articles&#xD;
they could get hold of in their haste.&#xD;
By the time the whole gang were is&#xD;

Inez, who knew how cruelly this man&#xD;
had been treated, waited ere she again&#xD;
addressed him. When ho became some-&#xD;

' Joaquin, some villains have  seized&#xD;

to rescue him, and need your aid, and&#xD;

' Most willingly,' replied Joaquin, and&#xD;
placing a small silver bugle to his lips he&#xD;
blew two notes, so sharp and loud that&#xD;
their echoes could be heard reverberating&#xD;
from the distant hills. But awakening&#xD;
the echoes were not the only effect. In&#xD;
a few moments, coming from different di-&#xD;
rections, nearly a dozen horsemen could&#xD;
be seen drawing towards the spot where&#xD;
the sounds proceeded.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Sanchez, in obedience to&#xD;
the directions of his mistress had saddled&#xD;
her favorite horse, and led him to the&#xD;
front of the house - when Inez, d (eiinn&#xD;

No sooner ad the horsemen, summon-&#xD;
d by tie bugle of Joaquin, all assem-&#xD;

led by Sanchez, through the bridle-path&#xD;
that led in the direction of the hut.&#xD;
It was the approach of this party which&#xD;
nduced the gang who had captured&#xD;
l onteagle, to leave the hut in such&#xD;
baste.&#xD;
Monteagle was so exceeding weak when&#xD;
he reached the spot where the horses of&#xD;
the thieves were tied, that, even had he&#xD;
wished to do so, he could not have retain-&#xD;
ed his seat, in the the saddle a moment.&#xD;
So, after placing him astride a horse, they&#xD;
lashed him in his scat with one of those&#xD;
ever-present and ever-useful lariats.&#xD;
No sooner was this done than away&#xD;
they started in the direction of the Pre-&#xD;
sidio Road, the pursuing foe, being less&#xD;
then a third of a mile behind them.&#xD;
'Who the deuce can they be,' said&#xD;
Blodget, who rode on one side of Mont-&#xD;

side.&#xD;
' It's more nor I can concaive,' replied&#xD;

' And most certainly not at such an&#xD;
hour,' said Blodget, ''Tis very, very&#xD;
strange. They still follow us,' he con-&#xD;
tinued, as he turned in the saddle, and&#xD;
looked back at the approaching party.&#xD;
By this time they had gained the road&#xD;
that-running almost parrallel with the&#xD;
shore of the Bay-passed the Presidio,&#xD;
and went on toward the rugged promon-&#xD;
tory which forms one side of the famous&#xD;
Golden Gate.&#xD;
For a few moments.they proceeded on&#xD;
in silence; occasionally glancing back to&#xD;
see if the party that so alarmed them,&#xD;
continued the pursuit. What they bad&#xD;
thus far feared was soon turned to cer-&#xD;
tainty, for they saw the whole party, num-&#xD;
bering nearly a dozen, emerge from the&#xD;
shrubbery, turn into the road, and follow&#xD;
after them at a good round pace.&#xD;
' As long as we keep this distance from&#xD;
them, don't force your horses, and we may&#xD;
yet contrive to escape them. Their nags&#xD;
must be pretty well blown, as they had a&#xD;
long ride before they reached the hut; and&#xD;
ours started fresh, after a good long rest,'&#xD;
said Blodget to his companions.&#xD;
Leaving the gang of thieves to pursue&#xD;
their way, let us return to Inez and the&#xD;
party accompanying.her.&#xD;
&#xD;
' They have all left the hut,' said San-&#xD;
chez, as they drew near it, ' and I think&#xD;
that is the young American, between the&#xD;
two that ride in advance of the party.'&#xD;
'Oh, for heaven's sake, let us spur on,&#xD;
and save him. Who knows what bloody&#xD;
purpose is in their cruel hearts I!' cried&#xD;
Inez.-&#xD;
'We must spare our horses over this&#xD;
uneven ground, if we hope to catch the&#xD;
villians,' replied Joaquin.&#xD;
&#xD;
' Be it as you say,' rejoined the maiden,&#xD;
reluctantly checking her eager steed who&#xD;
seemed impatient to leap forward.&#xD;
While these conversations were pro-&#xD;
ceeding, both parties had reached a fine&#xD;
piece of level ground that stretched away&#xD;
before them  in  the direction of the&#xD;
Presidio.&#xD;
' Now,' cried Joaquin, 'urge your hor-&#xD;
ses to the utmost !' and suiting the action&#xD;
to the words, his long spurs were buried&#xD;
into the side of his charger, who bounde&#xD;
forward like lightning.&#xD;
Keeping leap for.leap with his fleet&#xD;
steed was the gallant animal that bore-&#xD;
Inez on his back, while the rest of the&#xD;
party were but a few-rods in the rear.&#xD;
The vigilant Blodget soon observed that&#xD;
the pursuers had increased their speed,&#xD;
and were fast lessening the distance be-&#xD;
tween them.&#xD;
"' Let your horses do their d--est !&#xD;
cried the profane fellow, as he struck the&#xD;
rowels deep into the already bleeding&#xD;
sides of his courser&#xD;
His followers quickly obeyed his com-&#xD;

were soon scouring over the plain, at the&#xD;
very utmost speed of their respective hor-&#xD;

&#xD;
a box of candles, part of the cargo of the&#xD;
lighter. Half a dozen of them were soon&#xD;
burning, and by their glimmer the party&#xD;
fastened their jaded horses.&#xD;
Monteagle was released from his Ma.&#xD;
zeppa-like bonds, and placed on the floor&#xD;
of the cave, more dead than alive from the&#xD;
cruel way in which he had been tortured&#xD;
and afterwards lashed to the horse.&#xD;
A roaring fire was soon kindled, and&#xD;
by its lurid flames the party could see the&#xD;
vast size-of the cavern. Maretzo pointed&#xD;
out where the provisions were stowed, and&#xD;
each man bountifully helped himself, and&#xD;
then they all assembled around the bla-&#xD;
zing fire.&#xD;
One of the gang less unfeeling than the&#xD;
others, gave Monteagle a biscuit, and a&#xD;
drink out of his flask, which tended to re-&#xD;
lieve him somewhat.&#xD;
' What think you, Maretzo,' said Blod-&#xD;
get, drawing the Italian aside, after they&#xD;
had recovered from their fatigue, 'is there&#xD;
any more use wasting our time with this&#xD;
chap I'&#xD;
'I fear not' replied Maretzo. ' He is&#xD;
now so v4eak that he would probably&#xD;
faint under any fresh torture, and insen-&#xD;
sibility would baffle us.'&#xD;
'Then we must be off. Brown was&#xD;
to try to find out, by some other means,&#xD;
where the money was placed, and if he&#xD;
has succeeded, we must be on hand be-&#xD;
fore daylight to get hold of it. For the&#xD;
absence of Moiteagle may excite sus-&#xD;
picion, and our sport be spoiled.'&#xD;
'What shall we do with our prisoner&#xD;
Knock him on the head, and give the&#xD;
crabs a feast?'&#xD;
'No. Brown has someold scores ti&#xD;
settle with him.  You had better sta'&#xD;
here to-night with him, and in the morn&#xD;
ing I'll ride out lrere and report prc&#xD;

' Be it as you say. I shall not be sor-&#xD;
ry to have a few hours rest,' said Mar-&#xD;
etzo.&#xD;
' But how are we to get out of this&#xD;
trap V&#xD;
'You can easily get out of here on the&#xD;
side opposite to that by which we enter-&#xD;
ed. . By following the beach awhile you&#xD;
will strike a road that leads over the&#xD;
hills to the City. By that road return&#xD;
in the morning. I'll be on the look out&#xD;
for you!'&#xD;
' Pick up, boys,' cried Blodget, and in&#xD;
short time they had departed, piloted by,&#xD;
Maretzo, leaving Monteagle alone in the&#xD;
cavern.&#xD;
While taking him from the horse *he&#xD;
bandage had been partially removed iroun&#xD;
his eyes, and he had been a witness of all&#xD;
that went on.&#xD;
No sooner had they all quitted the&#xD;
place than he at once determined to&#xD;
make a desperate attempt to escape be-&#xD;
fore their return, as he felt that that was&#xD;
his only chance.&#xD;
Approaching the fire, he seized a piece&#xD;
of wood with his teeth and applied the&#xD;
blazing end to the cords that bound his&#xD;
arms. For some seconds it resisted the&#xD;
action of the fire, but at length it blazed,&#xD;
and was soon su weakened that with the&#xD;
energy of despair the youth snapped it,&#xD;
and had his hands again at liberty. He&#xD;
next looked around for some weapon,&#xD;
and luckily found a hatchet which Mar-&#xD;
etzo had used to open the cases. Thus&#xD;
armed, he stationed himself at the en-&#xD;
e trance of the cavern with the determina.&#xD;
tion to fell the ruffians to the earth as&#xD;
o they attempted -to enter, and then en-&#xD;
y deavor to make his escape. In a few mo-&#xD;
- ments Maretzo appeared and received a&#xD;
blow that sent him reeling and senseless&#xD;
to the ground.&#xD;

CHAPTER I&#xD;
&#xD;
The Robbery.&#xD;
IT was about two o'clock ef the morn-&#xD;
ing following the night in which so many&#xD;
events were crowded. The moon had&#xD;
gone down, and great masses of black&#xD;
clouds completely hid the stars. The&#xD;
wind blew violently from seawards, and&#xD;
the waves daled foniously against the&#xD;
massive piers which the enterprise of the&#xD;
San li , anciscans have carried far into the&#xD;
bosem of their glorious Bay&#xD;
'Well, if this aint a hell of a night, I'm&#xD;
d-d,' said a powerfully built man, who&#xD;
might nave been recognised as Montgom-&#xD;
ery had it not been so dark that a negro&#xD;
could not have been discerned front an&#xD;
albino.&#xD;
' By Vere in 'ell is Blodget a keepin'&#xD;
hisself,' said his companion, whose un-&#xD;
merciful treatment of the v's and w's an-&#xD;
nounced him to be a genuine Cockney,&#xD;
and such be was ; but previous to visit-&#xD;
ing California, he had paid Botany Bay&#xD;
a flying visit, his wrists graced with these&#xD;
bracelets, so much more useful than or-&#xD;
namental.&#xD;
These two men were in a large yawl,&#xD;
under a wharf near Davis street,&#xD;
'Boat a-hoy !' cried Blodget, on the&#xD;
&#xD;
wharf.&#xD;
' All right!' responded Montgomery4&#xD;
froth beneath it.&#xD;
'Vere've you been this jolly long vile,'&#xD;
&#xD;
bet.&#xD;
As he spoke a man leaped lightly into&#xD;
the boat. To the casual observer there&#xD;
was nothing in the appearance of this in-&#xD;
dividmal to attract particular attention,&#xD;
but one accustomed to gunge men's fig-&#xD;
ures by the eye, could not have failed to&#xD;
be struck by the broad shoulders, the&#xD;
full rounded chest, the muscular limbs,&#xD;
and the easy grace of every movement.&#xD;
Pity that a form so full of manliness&#xD;
should hold so black a heart.&#xD;
'Pull straight for the big wooden store,&#xD;
at the foot of Sanramento street.  Old&#xD;
Vandewater, thinking he was d-     d&#xD;
sharp, had the kegs of specie, packed in&#xD;
barrels of mackeral by Monteagle and&#xD;
put in the old store, thinking some of us&#xD;
might hear of the sale of the steamer,&#xD;
and break into his store. - Brown, to day,&#xD;
accidently overheard the carman speak&#xD;
&#xD;
of moving some mackerel, and as it tal-&#xD;
lycd with the day the money was moved,&#xD;
guessed the rest. We can easily get into&#xD;
the store.' continued Bloodget.&#xD;
' Give way !' said the man we have&#xD;
called Belcher, and at the same moment&#xD;
he dipped the blades of a pair of oars in.&#xD;
to the wat-r and the yawl flew forward.&#xD;
Few words were spoken, although&#xD;
there was small chance of their being&#xD;
overheard, so loudly howled the gale.&#xD;
When they reached the wharf upon&#xD;
which stood the store, they proceeded&#xD;

&#xD;
between the piles until all chance of s&#xD;
their light being observed was destroyed. h&#xD;
An auger was now produced, a hole bored&#xD;
in the planking, then a sharp well greased n&#xD;
key-hole saw was introduced and in less a&#xD;
than a quarter of an hour a hole suffi- o&#xD;
eiently large to admit a man, was made. v&#xD;
Belcher Kay easily raised himself by b&#xD;
his muscular arms into the store ; he b&#xD;
then assisted Bloodget up. The others c&#xD;
remained in the boat.                t&#xD;
A very few moments sufficed for t&#xD;
Bloodget and his companion to saw the&#xD;
hoops of the mackerel barrels, and thus t&#xD;
get posession of the boxes of gold.&#xD;
They were quickly lowered into the I&#xD;
boat, and the thieves got safely off with&#xD;
their booty.&#xD;
'Vell if old Wandevater don't svear&#xD;
in the morning, 1 hopes I may neversee&#xD;
old Hingland again.' cried the patriotic&#xD;
Britton as he saw the Golden ballast&#xD;
stowed in the bottom of the boat.&#xD;
' Pull for Mission creek,' said Blood-&#xD;
get,' they'll give Sydney Valley an aw-&#xD;
ful searching to morrow.'&#xD;
The robbers made good their escape,&#xD;
with the thirty thousand dollars in spe-&#xD;
cie, that had been so ingeniously hidden&#xD;
as Mr. Vandewater supposed.&#xD;
Great was the surprise of the worthy&#xD;
merchant, when summoned, early in the&#xD;
morning, by the storekeeper and inform-&#xD;
ed that. the store had been entered.-&#xD;
'But,' said his informant, ' they gained&#xD;
nothing by all their trouble, and out of&#xD;
spite destroyed the few barrels of macke-&#xD;
rel that were brought to the store the&#xD;
other day.'&#xD;
'Then they have got all the money.-&#xD;
Where's'Monteagle ? cried Mr. Vande-&#xD;
water   i&#xD;
' I tried to find him at his lodgings,'&#xD;
&#xD;
aid the man, 'but he had not been at&#xD;
ome all night, I was told.'&#xD;
At this moment Brown; Mr. V's part.&#xD;
er, entered, and expressed great surprise&#xD;
t the fact of the money being in the store&#xD;
f which he had not been informed. 'Tis&#xD;
ery remarkable that Monteagle should&#xD;
be out all night, the very time of the rob-&#xD;
bery. Was Monteagle aware of it being&#xD;
oncealed in the barrels, and placed in&#xD;
he store ?' continued Brown interroga-&#xD;
ively, to Vandewater.&#xD;
'He is the only person to whom I en-&#xD;
trusted the matter. As it was funds&#xD;
with which the firm had nothing to do.&#xD;
I did not deem it necessary to trouble&#xD;
you about the affair. Indeed, it was&#xD;
Monteagle that suggested the iode and&#xD;
place of concealing the money,' said Mr.&#xD;
Vandewater.&#xD;
'Why this is the most remarkable set&#xD;
of coincidences I ever heard of. A let..&#xD;
ter addressed to him, evidently brought&#xD;
by that fellow who afterwards stabbed a&#xD;
man-he proposes a way and place of&#xD;
hiding the money-the money is sto.&#xD;
len, and on the very night of its being ta-&#xD;
ken, he, Monteagle, is absent a!l night.&#xD;
Yet, he may clear himself,' said Brown.&#xD;
' It is too clear,' said Mr. Vandewater&#xD;
sorrowfully.- ' I would have trusted that&#xD;
youth with my life, and feel at this mo-&#xD;
ment far less regret for the loss of the&#xD;
money than losing all faith in the integ-&#xD;
rity of my fellow-men.'&#xD;
' We have both, I fear, been greatly&#xD;
deceived in Monteagle. Within the last&#xD;
few days I have heard that he gambled&#xD;
heavily, and was in the constant habit of&#xD;
visiting houses of ill-fame,' remarked&#xD;
Brown.&#xD;
' Well, what steps had we best take in&#xD;
regard to this unfortunate affair,' said&#xD;
the merchant.&#xD;
&#xD;
'There are suspicious circumstances&#xD;
sufficient to warrant the arrest of Mont-&#xD;
eagle,' replied Brown.&#xD;
' No-no---I cannot think of that.-&#xD;
He has been misled by others, and though&#xD;
I never wish to employ, or even see him&#xD;
again, I would not wish him to be arrested.&#xD;
So justly indignant are the citizens at&#xD;
the numerous robberies and fires that&#xD;
have lately taken place, that his convic-&#xD;
tion would be closely followed by his ex-&#xD;
ecution. The respectability of his posi-&#xD;
tion would be no bar to this, for the&#xD;
Vigilance Committee have determined to&#xD;
make an example of the first man that is&#xD;
fairly proven guilty.?&#xD;
'Be it as you will, sir,' said Brown,&#xD;
inwardly congratulating himself that in&#xD;
this manner all inquiry would be stopped&#xD;
with respect to the robbery.&#xD;
' Let nothing more be said about this&#xD;
unfortunate affair, Mr. Brown. Let the&#xD;
store-keeper's version ,pass as the true&#xD;
one--that thieves finding no booty in the&#xD;
store, departed after destroying some of&#xD;
the goods which were of too little value&#xD;
for them to remove.'&#xD;
Leaving Mr. Vandewater to make ar-&#xD;
rangements for replacing the stolen mo-&#xD;
ney, let us return to Monteagle, who, the&#xD;
reader will recollect, we left safe on the&#xD;
beaeh after his escape from the cavern of&#xD;
the robbers.                   .&#xD;
It was with the greatest difficulty, that&#xD;
he continued to drag his wearied limbs&#xD;
along over the hills and through the val-&#xD;
leys that lay between him and the city,&#xD;
and it was late in the morning before he&#xD;
appeared at the counting house of his&#xD;
employer, who was conversing with his&#xD;
partner at the moment.&#xD;
' And this you think is Monteagle's&#xD;
cap,' said Vandewater.&#xD;
I know it to be his, and saw it on his&#xD;
&#xD;
head last evening, as he passed up Pa-&#xD;
cific street,' responded Brown.&#xD;
'Ah, yes-yes. Too true-too true I&#xD;
Here are his initials, under the lining, in&#xD;
his own writing. This destroys my last&#xD;
hope of his innocence. And you say it&#xD;
was found close by the hole by which the&#xD;
robbers effected an entrance to the store.'&#xD;
' Yes; it was handed umse by the store-&#xD;
keeper. It was evidently dropped in the&#xD;
hurry and forgotten when too late. But&#xD;
here is the young gentleman himself,' said&#xD;
Brown, not a little surprised and alarm-&#xD;
ed at the appearance of Monteagle, whom&#xD;
he had supposed safely secured in tht&#xD;
cavern.&#xD;
'Mr. Monteagle,' said Vandewater, in&#xD;
a stern voice, slightly tremulous, howev-&#xD;
er, with regret, - Your services are no&#xD;
are no longer needed in this establish-&#xD;
ment, nor do I ever wish you to tread&#xD;
upon the threshhold of my house again.&#xD;
Great God ! what an escape poor Julia&#xD;
has bad. It was to this man I wished to&#xD;
entrust the keeping of your happiness !'&#xD;
Before Monteagle could recover from&#xD;
his surprise, Brown broke in; 'But&#xD;
perhaps, after all, Mr. Monteagle will ex-&#xD;
plain from whom he received the note&#xD;
the other day, and what was the nature&#xD;
of the appointment it made.&#xD;
Monteagle blushed, hesitated, stamu-?&#xD;
mered but' knew not how to reply.--&#xD;
This, then,' thought he, ' is the cause ot&#xD;
my dismissal.   Mr. Vandewater has&#xD;
learned of my associating with wantons,&#xD;
andjustly dismisses me from his confi-&#xD;
dence.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Vandewater who had&#xD;
been closely watching him, and with sor.&#xD;
row saw what he supposed were couvino.&#xD;
ing evidences of Monteagle's complicity&#xD;
in the robbery. Not giving the youth&#xD;
time to recover from his confusion, he&#xD;

&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.                71&#xD;
&#xD;
heavy boots into the face of the men who&#xD;
held his steed. But the same moment a&#xD;
brace of bullets whizzed through the air,&#xD;
and after a few convulsive clutches the&#xD;
young man fell heavily to the earth.&#xD;
Leaving him, where he had fallen, the&#xD;
men rushed to the assistance of the fel-&#xD;
low who had dragged the lady from her&#xD;
steed.&#xD;
'For God's sake, gentlemen, don't kill&#xD;
Joaquin. He has never injured you.'&#xD;
' Don't fret, honey, tisn't Joe Quin&#xD;
we're after. Tis your own elegant self,'&#xD;
said one of the ruffians.&#xD;
' So, you d-d stuck-up thing, you&#xD;
wouldn't dance with me at your outland-&#xD;
ish fandango, the other night. Now, my&#xD;
lady, you shall dance to other music;'&#xD;
and as he spoke he seized her brutally,&#xD;
and inflicted several fierce kisses upon&#xD;
her reluctant lips. Fired by her charms&#xD;
and her retance, the villain was pro-&#xD;
ceeding to fufither outrage, when, all her&#xD;
woman's nature flashing from her indig-&#xD;
nant eyes, she drew a small thin-bladed&#xD;
stiletto, and sent it's bright blade straight&#xD;
to the heart of the ravisher. For a mo-&#xD;
ment, and but for a moment, the villains&#xD;
were appalled at this prompt and terri-&#xD;
ble retribution. But even the thought of&#xD;
their guilty comrade hurried out of the&#xD;
world in the very act of perpetrating the&#xD;
most henious offence, could not make&#xD;
them pause in their infernal intentions,&#xD;
for seizing the hapless woman, now be-&#xD;
come insensible, they bore her into -a&#xD;
clump of bushes from which they had&#xD;
sprung upon Joaquin and his bride.&#xD;
Hours after, when Joaquin returned to&#xD;
consciousness, he found himself bound&#xD;
iand and foot, with strips of green hide.&#xD;
His horse and that of Carmencitto both&#xD;
gone.&#xD;
Joaquin's first impulse was to call&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
aloud upon the name of his young wife.&#xD;
But all was silent. ' Holy Virgin !' he&#xD;
exclaimed, as recollection began fully to&#xD;
return to him. 'Where art thou, Car-&#xD;
mencitto V' he shouted.  A  low, faint&#xD;
moaning was heard in the neighboring&#xD;
shrubbery. Again,-,md again, the wrwtch-&#xD;
ed youth called loudly on Carmenoitto.&#xD;
But the only replies he received were&#xD;
the faint moanings, which his foreboding&#xD;
heart, rather than his ear, told him came&#xD;
from the lips of Carmencitto. His sus-&#xD;
pense became insupportable. He would&#xD;
-he must-learn all. Even though&#xD;
that all confirmed a horrid suspicion that&#xD;
chilled the blood to very his heart.&#xD;
With the fierceness of a starving cay-&#xD;
ote he gnawed the green hide that con-&#xD;
fined his arms, and they once released&#xD;
he soon entirely disengaged himself. He&#xD;
sprang to, his feet, and rushed in the&#xD;
direction from whence the sounds of dis-&#xD;
tress proceeded. Better had he been&#xD;
smitten with eternal blindness than over&#xD;
have gazed upon that sad, sad spectacle.&#xD;
Carmencitto lay almost sensless upon&#xD;
the grass. Her modest garments torn to&#xD;
shreds, exposed her fair young bosom,&#xD;
slowly heaving, as if with the latest sobs&#xD;
of expiring life. Her cheeks were color-&#xD;
less. Her lips white as chalk, except&#xD;
where they were dabbled with the erim-&#xD;
on blood, that was slowly oozing at every&#xD;
respiration of her heaving breast!  In&#xD;
one of her little pale hands she clutched&#xD;
a small gold crucifix, which the villains&#xD;
had overlooked in their lust or haste.&#xD;
As Joaquin burst through the thick-&#xD;
et and stood before her,, the closed lids&#xD;
of her black eyes slowly opened, and sha&#xD;
cast one look full of love and sorrow up-&#xD;
on her heart-broken husband.&#xD;
Tearing his black locks he flung him-&#xD;
self on his knees by her side, and tende,-&#xD;
ly raising her, he pressed her to his heart&#xD;

&#xD;
and while he wiped the blood from her&#xD;
lips, his tears fell thick and fast upon her&#xD;
upturned face.&#xD;
'Speak to me, oh ! speak to me, Carm-&#xD;
encitto. My life ! My love !  Speak&#xD;
Oh, God, what have I done to deserve&#xD;
this ? Speak, dearest Carmeneitto,' and&#xD;
he pressed the form of his young wife&#xD;
again and again close to his heart. But&#xD;
no reply came from those dear lips.&#xD;
' Near at hand ran a babbling rivulet,&#xD;
to this Joaquin rushed, and scooping out&#xD;
some water in the hollow of his joined&#xD;
hands, laved with it the face of Carmen-&#xD;
oitto. But all in vain. ' Life had forev-&#xD;
er left that darlingform, dearer to him&#xD;
than all the gold that strews the placers&#xD;
of his native land.&#xD;
When Joaquin became certain that she&#xD;
was indeed dead, his grief at'first found&#xD;
vent in the most pathetic lamentations;&#xD;
but suddenly pausing, he dashed the tear-&#xD;
drops from his eyes, and drawing a dag-&#xD;
ger from its- sheath, he swore upon its&#xD;
cross-hilt eternal vengeance on the ravish-&#xD;
ers and murderers of his Carmencitto.&#xD;
Then decently arranging her disorder-&#xD;
ed garments, he lifted her sacred form&#xD;
in his arms, and bore it to his home-&#xD;
henceforth forever desolate.&#xD;
From the hour in which he saw the&#xD;
rude tomb raised over the ashes of his&#xD;
inurdered wife, Joaquin left forever-the&#xD;
home that promised to be such a happy&#xD;
one, and went forth an altered man.&#xD;
The crucifix of poor Carmencitto on his&#xD;
heart-revenge rankling in it.&#xD;
From that time'strange rumors began&#xD;
to circulate through California of daring&#xD;
robberies and frequent murders, and al-&#xD;
though no proofs of the guilty party could&#xD;
be obtained; yet when men spoke of them,&#xD;
their pale lips almost involuntarily mut-&#xD;
tered ' Joaquin/'&#xD;
&#xD;
When Inez returned to her father's&#xD;
residence at the Mission, her first resolve&#xD;
was to acquaint her parent with the cir-&#xD;
cumstances, but she found that he had&#xD;
been hastily summoned to a place at some&#xD;
distance, in consequence of a dispute be-&#xD;
tween one of his tenants and a squatter.&#xD;
Joaquin, whose advice she asked, re-&#xD;
commended that she should wait the com-&#xD;
ing of morning, when if Monteagle was&#xD;
not liberated, the authorities should be&#xD;
informed of the matter, and by their in-&#xD;
terference his liberation would no doubt&#xD;
easily be effected. But Joaquin had his&#xD;
.own private reasons for not visiting the.&#xD;
city.&#xD;
In the morning Inez accordingly rode&#xD;
to the city, and almost the first person&#xD;
she passed was Monteagle, who was just&#xD;
then repairing to the store of Mr. Van-&#xD;
dewater. Of course there was no occa-&#xD;
sion for Inez to interfere farther in the&#xD;
matter. Her first impulse was to ride&#xD;
up to him and congratulate him on his&#xD;
escape, but maidenly pride checked her,&#xD;
and she proceeded on, leaving Monteagle&#xD;
in entire ignorance of the 'deep interest&#xD;
she felt in his fortunes, and of the efforts&#xD;
she had made to rescue him the previous&#xD;
evening.&#xD;
Monteagle, meanwhile; sought his home&#xD;
to take a few hours rest, for both mind&#xD;
and body were terribly racked by the&#xD;
sufferings he had undergone.&#xD;
The day after the robbery of Mr. Van-&#xD;
dekhter's store, a group of some half-doz-&#xD;
en men were assembled around a fine fire&#xD;
kindled on the.ground, in the midst of a&#xD;
dense thicket, at the foot of the moun-&#xD;
tains, on the Contra Costa side of the&#xD;
of the Bay of San Francisco.&#xD;
'He's a' daring young devil, and with,&#xD;

Monteagle was disappointed. There&#xD;
was no letter for him.&#xD;
Only those who have been thousands&#xD;
and thousands of miles away from home,&#xD;
can understand the full effect of this&#xD;
crushing disappointment. Instantly the&#xD;

ly the 'line' we speak of has seen&#xD;

tion, even if he has been fortunate enough&#xD;
to experience none of those bitter disap-&#xD;
pointments himself.&#xD;
Belcher Kay and his fellow-rogues&#xD;
soon expended the money they obtained&#xD;
by the robbery of Vamdewater's store in&#xD;
riotous living. So a new crime was de-&#xD;
termined on.&#xD;
But it was necessary that he should be&#xD;
quick in his plans, for his means were&#xD;
daily becoming more limited, and he was&#xD;
well aware that success depended in a&#xD;
great measure upon promptitude. But&#xD;
what was he to do when his pecuniary&#xD;
resources were entirely exhausted.'&#xD;
This was a troublesome thought, and&#xD;
one which he was unable for some time&#xD;
to answer satisfactorily in his own mind.&#xD;
Money he must have by some means&#xD;
or another, or he would not have it in&#xD;
his power to carry on his nefarious pro-&#xD;
jects with any chance of success, and the&#xD;
bare idea of being reduced to poverty, af-&#xD;
tir the life of indolence, luxury, and ex-&#xD;
travagance he had led, made the villain&#xD;
shrink with dread. No-no-such a fate&#xD;
must not be his, and he determined to&#xD;
avoid it, even if the means he should have&#xD;
to adopt in doing so, he should have been&#xD;
compelled to adopt the most desperate&#xD;
and dangerous schemes.&#xD;
From any crime, however revolting, it&#xD;
might be, it has been very clearly shewn&#xD;
to the reader that Kay would not shrink;&#xD;
and, after deliberating for a short time&#xD;
within himself what was next to be done,&#xD;

going for a few nights on the highway,&#xD;
and thus trying his fortune. Tf in adop-&#xD;

&#xD;
ting this guilty resolution, the villain&#xD;
should have to perpetrate murder, he'&#xD;
would not have foreborne to do it, soon-&#xD;
er than he would have been disappointed&#xD;
of his object.&#xD;
Accordingly, on the following night, af.&#xD;
ter he had come to this resolution, Kay,&#xD;
well armed, secretly quitted the hotel&#xD;
where he was lodging, and took-his way&#xD;
to a lonely road, that led- to the Mis,&#xD;
sion, which was, notwithstanding, much&#xD;
frequented: Here he secreted himself,&#xD;
and eagerly watched the approach of&#xD;
some traveller who might possess the&#xD;
means about him of satisfying his wants.&#xD;
Belcher had taken good care to&#xD;
strengthen his determination by drinking&#xD;
deeply, before he started on his guilty&#xD;
purpose, and he now felt fully prepared&#xD;
for whatever might happen. Money he&#xD;
had made up his mind he would have at&#xD;
all hazards, an therefore it was not a tri-&#xD;
fle that was at all likely to moye him&#xD;
from his purpose.&#xD;
The place which Kay had chosen to&#xD;
conceal himself, was just at the entrance,&#xD;
of a dark and dismal lane, which branch-&#xD;
ed off .the road, and was a very conveni-&#xD;
ent place for the perpetration of a deed&#xD;
like that he contemplated.&#xD;
,Here then he seated himself upon the&#xD;
ground, where le could have a distinct&#xD;
view of the road for some distance, and&#xD;
every person that approached.&#xD;
It was a very fine night ; the moon&#xD;
shone brightly in the heavenly arch, and&#xD;
countless myriads of stars added their&#xD;
twinkling lustre to her radiant beams.&#xD;
Kay sat there for some time in a state&#xD;
of apathy, his thoughts wandered to no&#xD;
particular objects, but still his mind in-&#xD;
tent upon the desperate crime he had re--&#xD;
solved to perpetrate if the opportunity&#xD;
should be afforded him&#xD;
&#xD;
At last, however, becoming impatient,&#xD;
and feeling rather cold, for the night air&#xD;
was keen, he arose, and walked for some&#xD;
distance-along the road, taking care to&#xD;
keep close to the bushes, that separated&#xD;
it from the adjoining fields, and where&#xD;
he was less likely to be observed.&#xD;
In the course of a conversation which&#xD;
Belcl er had overheard between the land-&#xD;
lord df the hotel and his wife af-.&#xD;
ter they had retired to bed, (for they&#xD;
slept in the next chamber to him, and&#xD;
the rooms only being parted by a very&#xD;
slight partition. of canvas, he could hear&#xD;
every.word they uttered,) he had learnt&#xD;
that a drover, who invariably called at&#xD;
their house, and who usually had a large&#xD;
sum of money about him, was expected&#xD;
there that day, and he was also enabled&#xD;
to ascertain that this was the road he al-&#xD;
ways came; but he could not think of&#xD;
making an attempt to commt a robbery&#xD;
in the open daylight, and when his detec-&#xD;
tion would be almost certain to follow,&#xD;
and thus his nefarious wishes would be&#xD;
foiled. But then, as he understood that&#xD;
the drover usually slept at the hotel, the&#xD;
villain thought there might still be a&#xD;
chance left of his being enabled to "rob'&#xD;
him in the night.&#xD;
This, however, would be attended with&#xD;
considerable danger, for suspicion would,&#xD;
in all probability, light upon him, and&#xD;
should he abandon the place, it would,&#xD;
undoubtedly, be a direct confirmation of&#xD;
his guilt, and would put him.to great in.&#xD;
convenience in having to quit the neigh-&#xD;
bourhood,&#xD;
Reflecting therefore, in this manner,&#xD;
Kay was constrained to give up all&#xD;
thoughts of plundering the drover, al-&#xD;
though it was with much reluctance that&#xD;
he did so, for he had no doubt but that&#xD;
&#xD;
he should from him have been sure to&#xD;
have got a very rich booty.&#xD;
The day which succeeded the night&#xD;
on which Kay had overheard the conver-&#xD;
sation we have spoken of, was passed by&#xD;
him in a state of great agitation and un-&#xD;
certainty, and at one time he would de-&#xD;
termine upon some daring scheme, which&#xD;
the next moment would make him aband-&#xD;
on all idea of.&#xD;
The drover, however, did not come to&#xD;
the house that day, but Kay gathered&#xD;
from the conversation of his host, that&#xD;
he would sure to be there that night, so&#xD;
that he might be in time for the market&#xD;
on the following morning. Kay caught&#xD;
at this information, and his hopes once&#xD;
more revived ; le resolved to lay wait for&#xD;
him, and make a desperate attempt to&#xD;
rob him as he had at first design-d.&#xD;
Kay was no coward, as that which has&#xD;
been already related, will fully prove,&#xD;
and he was, therefore, prepared for any&#xD;
resistance which his marked victim might&#xD;
make, and he had made up his mind not&#xD;
to be defeated easily. But from what-&#xD;
he could learn, the drover was an old&#xD;
man, and one who was not very likely to&#xD;
offer much resistance, especially when he&#xD;
saw that the individual who attacked&#xD;
him was well armed, and a determined&#xD;
man, and, therefore, Kay calculated that&#xD;
his success was almost certain. -.&#xD;
He had taken the precaution to pro-&#xD;
vide himself with a mask and poncho, so&#xD;
that he might be fully enabled to dis-&#xD;
guise himself, and these were the more&#xD;
indispensable for the villain's safety, as&#xD;
he intended to return to the hotel after&#xD;
the perpetration of the robbery.&#xD;
Impatient and gloomy, Kay continued&#xD;
to traverse the road for some time, but&#xD;
still he saw no signs of the traveller or&#xD;
of any other person, and he began to des-&#xD;
&#xD;
pair. The place was sufficiently quiet&#xD;
and lonely to inspire no very pleasant re-&#xD;
flections in the mind of Kay, and so rap-&#xD;
idly did they crowd upon his brain, that&#xD;
he had not strength to endure them, and&#xD;
he almost made up his mind to abandon&#xD;
his villainous project, and return to the&#xD;
hotel to seek that society which might&#xD;
alone banish such fearful thoughts.&#xD;
At length the solemn booming of the&#xD;
Mission bell vibrated on the air, toll-&#xD;
ing the hour of ten, and Kay, whose pa-&#xD;
tience was now quite tired out, and whose&#xD;
disappointment could only be equalled&#xD;
by chagrin, resolved to wait no longer&#xD;
but to return to the hotel.&#xD;
He had just turned round for that pur.&#xD;
pose, when the low trampling of horses'&#xD;
hoof, ata distance, arrested his purpose&#xD;
and r kindled his hopes.&#xD;
Th.) sounds proceeded from behind&#xD;
him, and looking eagerly along the road&#xD;
as far as his eyes could penetrate, at first&#xD;
be could not perceive anything, but at&#xD;
length he beheld a horse trotting slowly&#xD;
along the road, in the direction of the&#xD;
place where he was standing, and bearing&#xD;
on his back a person who he was unable&#xD;
at present, to observe, distinctly.&#xD;
'It must be him!' muttered Kay to&#xD;
himself, and hope once more elated and&#xD;
nerved him. His mind was fully made&#xD;
up; he would have all the money thegra-&#xD;
zier had about him, even. if to obtain it&#xD;
he had to embrue his haud sin his blood.&#xD;
Quickly the miscreant glided cautious-&#xD;
ly along the darkest and most overshad-&#xD;
owed part of.-theroad, and le once more&#xD;
reached the entrance to the lane which the&#xD;
traveller must pass; and which appeared&#xD;
to him to be the most convenient spot for&#xD;
the perpetration of the deed.&#xD;
'But-but'-muttered Kay, 'I will&#xD;
not harm him-no-no-I will not harm&#xD;
him, if I can avoid it! I do not want&#xD;

&#xD;
his blood, but his money, it will be his&#xD;
own fault should he lose his life.'&#xD;
Nearer and nearer the rider approach-&#xD;
ed, and at length he had got to within a&#xD;
very short distance of the place where&#xD;
Kay was concealed, and by the bright&#xD;
light of the moon, he was enabled to have&#xD;
a distinct view of his person.&#xD;
He was a thickset man, about sixty,&#xD;
and carried with him a short whip with&#xD;
a very heavy handle.' He was whistling&#xD;
merrily along the road, apparently, quite&#xD;
happy and unsuspicious of any danger,&#xD;
and what Kay could perceive of his fea-&#xD;
tures, he looked like a man who was not&#xD;
likely to be easily intimidated. Again&#xD;
be muttered to himself,-.&#xD;
'I hope he will resign hip money eas-&#xD;
ily; I hope he will not make any resist-&#xD;
ance; I would not have his blood upon&#xD;
my conscience, but his money I will&#xD;
have.'&#xD;
The man had now got to within a very&#xD;
short distance of the lane, and Kay had&#xD;
no doubt from the description which had&#xD;
been given of him, that this was the&#xD;
grazier.&#xD;
He clenched his fist~nervously, and in-&#xD;
voluntarily placed his other hand on* one&#xD;
of-the pistols which he carried with him.&#xD;
. 'I will let him pass me,' thought Kay,&#xD;
'I will let him pass me before I pounce&#xD;
out upon him, and then I shall take him&#xD;
more by surprise, and he will be less&#xD;
likely to offer any resistance.'.&#xD;
The traveller had now left off whist-&#xD;
ling, and had broke into a negro melody,&#xD;
which he sang in self-satisfied tones, but&#xD;
which were anything but harmonious.,&#xD;
-'Your money or your life !' cried Kay&#xD;
in a disguised voice, rushing up to&#xD;
the traveller, from his place of conceal.&#xD;
ment,-and laying hold of the horse's bri-&#xD;
dle.&#xD;
&#xD;
The old man, was of course, rather&#xD;
startled, but he collected himself in a&#xD;
moment, and with the utmost coolness,&#xD;
said:-&#xD;
'I tells thee what it is, young nan,&#xD;
your'e on a bad errand, and I advise you&#xD;
let go the bridle, and go about your bu-&#xD;
siness, before harm come to you.'&#xD;
- There, there, no nonsense,' replied&#xD;
Kay, in an impatient tone; 'I am a des-&#xD;
perate man and must have money.'&#xD;
'D-n you, you are a daring rascal,'&#xD;
cried the traveller, 'let go of the bridle;&#xD;
or it may not be long ere I make you re-&#xD;
pent thy job. Leave go of the bridle, I&#xD;
again-tell you! You won't, then, d-u&#xD;
me, if I don't soon make you, and that's&#xD;
all about it'&#xD;
With these words the traveller flour-&#xD;
ished his heavy whip, and aimed a blow&#xD;
at the head of Kay with the butt-end of&#xD;
it, which if he had not stepped quickly&#xD;
aside and avoided would, in all probabil-&#xD;
ity have deprived him immediatety of far-&#xD;
ther power.-&#xD;
'Old idiot.! cried the enraged ruffian,&#xD;
' you will urge me to that which I would&#xD;
rather avoid; will you deliver up your&#xD;
money, I say, once more T'&#xD;
'No,' promptly replied the old man;&#xD;
'I'll see you d-d first, and all such&#xD;
scoundrels.'*&#xD;
'Then, by h-11 you will have to pay&#xD;
for your obstinacy with your life!' cried&#xD;
Kay, hastily groping about beneath his&#xD;
poncho to get ott one of the pistols.&#xD;
The old man immediately guessed at&#xD;
what he was about, and sprang from his&#xD;
horse's back with the agility of a youth,&#xD;
and the moment that Kay got out his&#xD;
pistol, and before he could cock it, he-clo-&#xD;
sed with him, and being a strong, power-&#xD;
ful man, the struggle threatened to be a&#xD;
determined one.&#xD;
&#xD;
Kay, however, was wound up to a pitch&#xD;
of desperation, for it was a moment of&#xD;
life or death, and he was taken somewhat&#xD;
by surprise, as, from the age of the trav-&#xD;
eller, he had not expected such an antag-&#xD;
onist-&#xD;
Kay was a very muscular man, and&#xD;
had youth on his side, and he, of course,&#xD;
mustered up all his strength for this oc-&#xD;
casion, and endeavoured to get his hands&#xD;
at liberty; but the old man had pinned&#xD;
them with such an iron grip, that all his&#xD;
efforts were ineffectual, and maledictions&#xD;
the most terrible escaped his lips, as the&#xD;
danger of his situation became every in-&#xD;
stant greater; for, as his strength de-&#xD;
creased, so did that of the traveller ap-&#xD;
pear to increase, and he expected noth-&#xD;
ing less that he must be overpowered.&#xD;
The struggle lasted several minutes,&#xD;
the traveller having pinched the hands of&#xD;
Kay so tightly, that he was compelled&#xD;
to drop the pistol to the ground, and&#xD;
which the former was afraid to secure,&#xD;
for fearthat, in resigning his hold of the&#xD;
robber, he should lose the advantage&#xD;
he had gained. But.at length the foot&#xD;
of Kay caught in something on the&#xD;
ground, and he fell, dragging the old&#xD;
man with him.&#xD;
Fortunately, the traveller did not fall&#xD;
upon him, or his weight would have&#xD;
quickly decided the combat, and Kay&#xD;
would have been defeated, but he fell by&#xD;
his side, and consequently was obliged&#xD;
to leave go his hold ; and Kay, seeing&#xD;
the moment of advantage, and probably&#xD;
the only opportunity of, saving his life,&#xD;
jumped to hi3 feet with the speed of&#xD;
lightning, and snatching the pistol from&#xD;
his bosom, he sprang upon the old man,&#xD;
knelt upon his chest,--he pressed the fin-&#xD;
gers of his other hand tightly in his throat&#xD;
until the old man was nearly strangled, he&#xD;
&#xD;
presented the pistol at his head as he&#xD;
exclaimed-&#xD;
' You deserve to lose your life for&#xD;
your infernal obstinacy, and it is at this&#xD;
moment in my power ; but I do not&#xD;
wish to harm you if I can help it. Now,&#xD;
then, your money.'&#xD;
The old rran who was quite overpow-&#xD;
ered by the pressure on his chest, and&#xD;
the violence with which Kay pressed his&#xD;
knuckles into his throat, he tried to&#xD;
speak, but could only make a sign 1o his&#xD;
Boat-pocket, which Kay understanding,&#xD;
released the old man from the hold which&#xD;
he had taken of his throat; and, putting&#xD;
his hand into his pocket, to which he had&#xD;
directed his attention, he drew forth a&#xD;
a canvass bag apparently well loaded, and&#xD;
depositing it carefully in his bosom, he&#xD;
secured both the pistols, and, rising from&#xD;
the ground, he said to the still prostrate&#xD;
traveller-&#xD;
'Beware!l you see that I have all the&#xD;
power of your life or death in my hands;&#xD;
if you move a step to pursue me, until I&#xD;
am out of sight, that instant you die!1'&#xD;
The old man did not make any reply,&#xD;
for he had not yet recovered from the ef-&#xD;
fects of the combat, and was unable to&#xD;
utter a word; and Kay, having satisfied&#xD;
himself that he had secured all the mo-&#xD;
ney in his possession, hastily retreated&#xD;
from the spot, and springing into the&#xD;
fields, threw away the poncho, and made&#xD;
the best of his way towards the hotel,&#xD;
which he reached in an almost inconceiv-&#xD;
able short space of time. and, without&#xD;
betraying any emotion, entered the bar,&#xD;
as was his usual custom, and taking his&#xD;
seat called for a mug of ale.&#xD;
He had not been there long, when he&#xD;
heard a loud shouting and hallooing out-&#xD;
side the house, and he immediately ree-&#xD;
ognized the tones.&#xD;
' Why,' said the landlord, laying down&#xD;

hip pipe, 'that certainly is the voice of&#xD;
a friend; what the deuce can be the&#xD;
matter with him?'&#xD;
Kay felt a little alarmed; but he con-&#xD;
cealed his agitation, and continued with&#xD;
apparent unconcern, to smoke his pipe,&#xD;
and to be completely absorbed in the en-&#xD;
joyment of that and his ale: He would&#xD;
have been glad to have retired to his&#xD;
chamber, so that he might have escaped&#xD;
all observation, but he was fearful that&#xD;
he might, by so doing, probably excite&#xD;
suspicion, and he therefore kept his seat&#xD;
and pretended to take no notice of what&#xD;
was passing.&#xD;
The landlord having hastened to the&#xD;
door of the house to meet his guest, and&#xD;
to enquire what was the matter with him&#xD;
was quickly heard returning accompani-&#xD;
ed by the old man, who was grumbling,&#xD;
and swearing all the way.&#xD;
On entering the bar, the drover gazed&#xD;
round upon the different persons there&#xD;
assembled, but appeared to take little&#xD;
notice of Kay, whose assumed color, no&#xD;
doubt, removed every idea of his being&#xD;
the robber from his mind.&#xD;
' He was a most'desperate scoundrel,&#xD;
whoever he is,' said the drover, 'and I-&#xD;
feel the effects of his d-d knuckles on&#xD;
my throat, now. I wish I could only&#xD;
meet with the fellow, and I warrant me&#xD;
he'd not escape from my clutches again,&#xD;
very easily.'&#xD;
' This is a bad job, aterrible bad job,'&#xD;
aid the landlord.&#xD;
'Aye, it is indeed a bad job,' said the&#xD;
Irover, -'two -thousand dollars is no&#xD;
small sum to lose as times go.'&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
The Ride-the Midnight Fright-the&#xD;
Corpse-The Secret Burial.&#xD;
KAY took no part in the conversation&#xD;
which followed, the staple of which con-&#xD;
sisted of dennunciations of the scoundrels&#xD;
who infested the city of San Francisco&#xD;
aud its vicinity, perpetrating with im-&#xD;
punity the most, daring robberies and&#xD;
even more atrocious offences.&#xD;
Kay was slightly known to several of'&#xD;
the 'crowd' who had been drawn to the&#xD;
bar by rumors respecting the robbery,&#xD;
and as Kay sauntered out of the room -&#xD;
one of these persons whispered a few&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
words to the drover, who turned and&#xD;
closely scrutinized the robber's per-&#xD;
son.. Kay bore his fixed gaze apparent-&#xD;
ly unmoved. But he inwardly determ-&#xD;
ined that the drover should never bear&#xD;
witness against him!&#xD;
A few evenings after this robbery,&#xD;
Inez had taken a long ride, and on her&#xD;
return was overtaken by a sudden and&#xD;
violent storm. She immediately put her&#xD;
horse to the run. Inez was too much&#xD;
accustomed to heavy rains and violent&#xD;
storms of wind to be much alarmed, as.&#xD;
she knew her fleet steed would soon&#xD;
bear her home in safety. Bat scarcely&#xD;
had our heroine proceeded a couple of&#xD;
hundred varas when her horse fell heav-&#xD;
ily. Fortunately, however, Inez was&#xD;
but little injured. Her horse she soon&#xD;
discovered was unable to rise. Of course&#xD;
no alternative was left her but to pro-&#xD;
ceed homewards on foot.&#xD;
Notwithstanding, however, she sought&#xD;
all that was in her power to strengthen&#xD;
this idea, many, doubts, fears, misgiv-&#xD;
ings, and apprehensions would steal into&#xD;
her bosom,-and every blast of wind which&#xD;
howled around her seemed to come&#xD;
fraught with the moanings of despair.&#xD;
She had travelled about three miles from&#xD;
the place at which she had lost her horse,&#xD;
and was upon a dreary waste, where&#xD;
there was nothing to protect her from&#xD;
the fury of the blast and the fast falling&#xD;
rain which drifted around her. It was&#xD;
a most awful spot, and in spite of her re-&#xD;
sistance to fear, she felt the most inde-&#xD;
scribable sensation of horror creeping&#xD;
through her veins.&#xD;
'Holy Mary !' she exclaimed, 'my&#xD;
weary and benumbed limbs will not sup-&#xD;
port me much further, and yet, if I pause,&#xD;
nothing but death stares me in the face.&#xD;
How awful is the darkness around, and&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
here am I placed alone, and fated to en-&#xD;
dure all this toil and wretchedness.&#xD;
Could I but hear the sound even of a&#xD;
human voice, methinks it would be tran-&#xD;
sport to my soul. This silence is appal-&#xD;
ling. Whenever I have had occasion to&#xD;
cross this wild spot, I always felt the&#xD;
most irresistable terror; it is, indeed, a&#xD;
fit place for the perpetration of the&#xD;
bloody crimes which report says have&#xD;
been committed here, and I do not won-&#xD;
der that people should shun it after night-&#xD;
fall in dread, my God! do not desert me&#xD;
in this dreadful moment. Oh! I remem-&#xD;
ber there is an old house not far from this&#xD;
spot; could I but reach that, it would&#xD;
afford me shelter until my recruited&#xD;
strength will enable me to proceed. The&#xD;
storm increases; what will become of&#xD;
me? The rain falls faster than ever; I&#xD;
must proceed. Protect me, heaven!'&#xD;
Trembling in every limb, and her&#xD;
knees smiting each other, Inez forced&#xD;
her way as well she was able, in the di-&#xD;
rection of the old house, which she at&#xD;
length perceived at no great distance&#xD;
from her, and so completely exhausted&#xD;
was she, that had she had to have pro-&#xD;
ceeded many yards further she must have&#xD;
sunk to the earth. It was an old build-&#xD;
ing, broken irr many parts. -&#xD;
An old story gave the place a kind of&#xD;
fearful interest; and there was one pe-&#xD;
riod when Inez would not have ventured&#xD;
within its precints, but now she thought&#xD;
nothing about it; she thought only of&#xD;
her weary and exhausted state. She&#xD;
reached the wretched place, and found&#xD;
no obstruction to her entrance, the door&#xD;
having long since been torn off its hinges,&#xD;
and she, therefore, staggered into the&#xD;
place, and threw herself, exhausted and&#xD;
breathless, upon a heap of rubbish in one&#xD;
corner, to rest herself for a few minutes,&#xD;

&#xD;
ere she could see what was best to be&#xD;
done for her accomodation for theidght.&#xD;
The house was divided into two compart-&#xD;
ments, and one of these was in much&#xD;
better condition than the other. There,&#xD;
then, Inez determined to remain till day-&#xD;
break; and gathering together some&#xD;
pieces of old boarding which had fallen&#xD;
from different parts of the building, and&#xD;
a heap of straw, which she found in one&#xD;
corner, she retired into it, contrived to&#xD;
make herself up some kind of a rude pal-&#xD;
let, piled all the old rubbish she could&#xD;
find against the door which opened into&#xD;
this division of the house, and then im-&#xD;
ploring the protection of Heaven, she&#xD;
wrapped herself closely in her cloak, and&#xD;
llid down.&#xD;
Completely wearied out, it was not&#xD;
long ere she was -about to si k off to&#xD;
sleep, when she was suddenly  armed&#xD;
and astonished by hearing a noise outside&#xD;
the building, and soon after, a light glim-&#xD;
mered between the crevices, and the hor-&#xD;
.ror and amazement of Inez may be easi-&#xD;
ly conjectured when she caught a glimpse&#xD;
of the shadow of two men, bearing some-&#xD;
ring which seemed to be very heavy&#xD;
between them. They moved stealthily&#xD;
and cautiously round by the -side of the&#xD;
building towards the entrance, and Inez&#xD;
had not the least doubt but that they&#xD;
were coming there; in a nother second&#xD;
her conjectures were confirmed, and she&#xD;
heard them deposit their burthen in the&#xD;
adjoining shed to that in which she was.&#xD;
How shall we attempt to portray the&#xD;
terror of Inez at this circumstance 2&#xD;
She didnot venture to breathe scarcely,&#xD;
and screwed herself into the smallest&#xD;
possible compass in the corner, for fear&#xD;
that the men should discover her there&#xD;
but, from a small hole in the boards, sh&#xD;
could perceive what was'passing.&#xD;
&#xD;
'My God!' she thought, ' what can&#xD;
be the purpose of these men? Certainly&#xD;
no good,'at such an hour.'&#xD;
Inez placed her eye to the hole in the&#xD;
boarding, and perceived that they were&#xD;
two powerful men, dressed in ponchos,&#xD;
and as the rays of the light fell upon&#xD;
their countenances, she shuddered at&#xD;
their aspects.&#xD;
They had placed the sack upon the&#xD;
floor, and began digging up the earth&#xD;
with a couple of spades which they had&#xD;
brought with them. A deadly chill fell&#xD;
upon the heart of Inez when she beheld&#xD;
this, and she could scarcely repress a&#xD;
scream, as a dreadful idea shot through&#xD;
her brain.,-                       .&#xD;
'Horror! horror!' she reflected, 'the&#xD;
wretches have surely been committing&#xD;
murder, and have come hither to bury&#xD;
their unfortunate victim.'-&#xD;
'There, we shall soon be able to make&#xD;
a snug lodging for him,' said one of the&#xD;
villains, taking up a spade and prepa-.&#xD;
ring to begin to dig, 'and no one will&#xD;
ever know what has become of him.&#xD;
How nicely we gammoned the old fool&#xD;
to take up his lodging with us.'&#xD;
'You're right,' said the other, 'it was&#xD;
very well done, and I must give you the&#xD;
credit of doing the best part towards it.&#xD;
If the friends of the old drover look for&#xD;
his return home, how woefully deceived&#xD;
they will be.'&#xD;
'Ha! ha! ha!' laughed the first vil-&#xD;
lain, 'indeed they will. Well, we have&#xD;
got a very tidy booty for this job,'&#xD;
'Yes, it will pay us for the trouble&#xD;
we have been at,' was the answer; 'but&#xD;
I'll warrant that we shall circulate the&#xD;
blunt a little more freely than the old&#xD;
fellow would have done. We must not&#xD;
e be in the city many days.' .&#xD;
' As soon as the job's over we will&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
quit the spot,' returned his companion,&#xD;
' and it will be many a long day ere we&#xD;
shall revisit this neighborhood again.&#xD;
We couldn't have fixed a much better&#xD;
place than this to deposit the old fel-&#xD;
low's remains in ; but, I say, there is a&#xD;
door yonder, which seems to lead to an-&#xD;
other part of the house; suppose we ex-&#xD;
amine that, and see whether it will serve&#xD;
better to conceal the bodyof the mur-&#xD;
dered man in than this.'&#xD;
- 'Great God!' thought Inez, 'I am&#xD;
lost; they will discover and murder me.&#xD;
By what horrible fatality were my foot-&#xD;
steps guided to this place?'&#xD;
'Psha! what's the use of talking in&#xD;
that manner, Kay?' said the other ruf-&#xD;
fian, to whom this proposition was ad-&#xD;
dressed; 'we have no time to spare; be-&#xD;
sides, we have half dug the grave here,&#xD;
and I dare say the old chap will lie-as&#xD;
contented here as he would a foot or&#xD;
two off. Come, come, let's, finish the&#xD;
business and begone, for I am almost ti-&#xD;
red of it, and if we remain here much&#xD;
longer, there's no knowing but that we&#xD;
might be discovered.'&#xD;
'Oh, very well,' said Kay, as the oth-&#xD;
er man had called him, 'it matters very&#xD;
litlle, so let's go to work, and get done&#xD;
as quick as possible'&#xD;
'I think we have given him   depth&#xD;
enough,' remarked the other wretch,&#xD;
'and he'll not pop up again in a hurry&#xD;
by himself. Come, out with him, and&#xD;
let's finish the job at once.'&#xD;
This, as may be imagined, was a mo-&#xD;
ment of unutterable horror to our he-&#xD;
roine, who had watched the proceedings,&#xD;
and listened to the conversation of the&#xD;
assassins with the most breathless atten-&#xD;
tion; and a shuddering seized upon her&#xD;
freme which she found it impossible to&#xD;
resist.-It would, however, be useless to&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
attempt to describe the relief she felt&#xD;
when she heard the observations of the&#xD;
first ruffian, by which he was persuaded&#xD;
from entering the place in which she was&#xD;
concealed; but every moment that they&#xD;
prolonged their stay increased*her ter-&#xD;
ror and anxiety, for fear that her infant&#xD;
should awake, and, crying loud, betray&#xD;
her.&#xD;
After having untied the mouth of the&#xD;
sack, they drew it nearer to the edge of&#xD;
the grave they had been digging, and&#xD;
turned out the body of a stout but aged&#xD;
man, whose long grey locks were mat-&#xD;
ted together with large clots of blood&#xD;
that had issued from several deep wounds&#xD;
in the skull.&#xD;
Horror enchained all the faculties of&#xD;
Inez, and with distended eyelids, she fix-&#xD;
ed her straining eyeballs upon the dread-&#xD;
ful specacle.&#xD;
Her blood seemed turned to ice, and&#xD;
her heart seemed almost to cease its pul-&#xD;
sation. Should the wretches find out&#xD;
that she was there concealed, and had&#xD;
been watching them, and overheard the&#xD;
the acknowledgement of their dreadful&#xD;
crime, the'death of herself would be cer-&#xD;
tain to follow.&#xD;
These reflections passed rapidly in the&#xD;
mind of Inez, as she watched, in a state&#xD;
of the most breathless suspense, the ac-&#xD;
tions of the murderers, as they, in the&#xD;
most callous manner, tossed the body of&#xD;
their wretched victim into the grave they&#xD;
had dug for its reception, and commen-&#xD;
ced filling it up, occupying the interval&#xD;
during the disgusting scene, with the&#xD;
most ribald conversation, which smote&#xD;
the heart of our heroine with horror, as&#xD;
she listened to it,&#xD;
' There,' exclaimed Kay, as he placed&#xD;
the last spade-full of earth on the grave&#xD;
of their murdered victim, 'that job's fin-&#xD;

rupted happiness, and come at once to&#xD;
that unfortunate circumstance Which&#xD;
was the cause of my indiscretion, and&#xD;
occasioned me all that anguish I so se-&#xD;
verely felt afterwards.&#xD;
'An accident brought Captain Dari-&#xD;
an and his friend, the Earl Mansville, to&#xD;
our house, from which the latter was&#xD;
unable to be removed for several weeks.&#xD;
Alas ! it was a fatal day for me; the&#xD;
earl was young, handsome, insinuating,&#xD;
and the very first moment I beheld him,&#xD;
my heart felt a sensation it never before&#xD;
had experienced, and too soon I was com-&#xD;
pelled to acknowledge to myself that I&#xD;
had become deeply enamoured of him.&#xD;
Fatal attachment! had I not been un-&#xD;
pardonably thoughtless, I should at once&#xD;
have seen the folly, the danger, the hope-&#xD;
lessness of indulging, or encouraging a&#xD;
passion for one so far above me, and&#xD;
who would, probably, not feel for me a&#xD;
mutual sentiment, and have stifled it in&#xD;
its infancy. But it was not to be: I&#xD;
was to be taught reason by dear-bought&#xD;
experience. At length, the earl being&#xD;
restored to canvalescence, quitted our&#xD;
house, but I felt convinced it was with&#xD;
reluctance, and I noticed the looks he&#xD;
fixed on me, with a sentiment of mingled&#xD;
delight and astonishment. The glances&#xD;
he bestowed on me, were those of admi-&#xD;
ration-of love! How my heart bound-&#xD;
ed at this idea, I need not tell; but, alas!&#xD;
it should have been its greatest cause of&#xD;
anguish, and my pleasure was greatly in-&#xD;
creased when I learned that Mansville&#xD;
having expressed his delight at the neigh-&#xD;
borhood, had taken up his abode in it&#xD;
for a short time ; but Captain Darian&#xD;
had male his departure some days previ-&#xD;
ous to another part of the country. I&#xD;
frequently saw the earl, and he seemed&#xD;
anxious to say something to me, but had&#xD;
&#xD;
not an opportunity, as I was mostly in&#xD;
the presence of my parents ; but I need-&#xD;
ed no interpretation of his thoughts; my&#xD;
own sentiments fully elucidated them,&#xD;
and the warmth of the glances he be-&#xD;
stowed upon me. If it required anything&#xD;
to strengthen the affection with which&#xD;
Mansville had inspired me, it was the&#xD;
amiable character he soon acquired in&#xD;
the neighborhood,,his chief pleasure ap-&#xD;
pearing to be the performing of acts of&#xD;
benevolence and philanthropy, and the&#xD;
blessings of the poor were amply lavish-&#xD;
ed upon him. Rash, thoughtless, girl&#xD;
that I was. I should have made my pa-&#xD;
rents acquainted with the real state of&#xD;
my feelings, and sought their advice up-&#xD;
on the subject. but, for the first timo&#xD;
in my life, I was anxious to conceal my&#xD;
thoughts from them, and continued to&#xD;
encourage and strengthen those passions&#xD;
which reason ought to have convinced&#xD;
me could never have been requited by&#xD;
the object who had inspired me with&#xD;
them.&#xD;
It was about a month after the EJarl&#xD;
Mansville had quitted our house, that I&#xD;
arose rather earlier one morning than&#xD;
was my usual custom, induced by the fine-&#xD;
ness of the weather. I descended from&#xD;
my chamber, and entered the garden,&#xD;
which was beautifully and tastefully ar-&#xD;
ranged, and in which, as well as my&#xD;
father and brother, I took much pleas-&#xD;
ure. My attention, however, was par-&#xD;
ticularly devoted to a rose tree, which&#xD;
I had frequently heard the earl express&#xD;
his' admiration of it while he was re-&#xD;
maining at our house. Could I but get&#xD;
him by any means to receive one how&#xD;
happy should I have been. This day I&#xD;
had resolved to make my father and&#xD;
mother a little present of some of these&#xD;
roses, which I knew they would receive&#xD;

&#xD;
pistol from his bosom, and presented it&#xD;
towards his head! With a wild shriek&#xD;
of terror, I rushed into his arms, and ar-&#xD;
rested his fatal purpose. Some spell,&#xD;
some horrid spell came over me. I re-&#xD;
member the last cloud of smoke curling&#xD;
over our ancient trees.-I-I've no fur-&#xD;
ther recollection. When my senses were&#xD;
restored, and reason was permitted again&#xD;
to resume its sway,-I found myself an&#xD;
mate of the earl's villa, and far away&#xD;
from that home I had rendered wretch-&#xD;
ed. Oh, God, how dreadful, how agon-&#xD;
izing were the thonghts that first crossed&#xD;
my brain I I upbraided myself for a&#xD;
wretch unfit to live-as one who had&#xD;
disgraced herself and destroyed the peace&#xD;
of the most affectionate of parents for&#xD;
ever, and which ever way I turned, a&#xD;
curse seemed to pursue me.&#xD;
Mansville tried all his eloquence could&#xD;
effect to console me; renewed his most&#xD;
tender asseverations, and repeated his&#xD;
promise to make me his bride. Strange&#xD;
infatuations !-I believed him;-I be-1&#xD;
came tranquil-and if the thoughts of&#xD;
my parents and the name I had aban-&#xD;
doned ever returned to my memory, they,&#xD;
were quickly banished by the soothings, j&#xD;
and fond protestations of the earl. Day&#xD;
after day passed away, and still he&#xD;
promised, but failed- to keep his word.&#xD;
My humble dress was now exchanged&#xD;
for fasionable finery and Mansville visited&#xD;
me every day, repeating each time with&#xD;
grea-ter energy the vows of -love with s&#xD;
which he had at first seduced from  myu&#xD;
home. Every luxury-every enjoyment&#xD;
that could be wished was at my com-'d&#xD;
mand; but could they yield me real hap- t&#xD;
piness? Oh, no. The splendour I was r&#xD;
now placed in, was purchased with ago- I&#xD;
ny; and my own feelings constantly re- v&#xD;
proached me for that offence of which I a&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
had been guilty. Some fated spell must&#xD;
have been upon me, or I must have soon&#xD;
been convinced that St. Clair was not&#xD;
sincere in his promises, or he would net&#xD;
day after day evade the fulfilment of&#xD;
them. But it was my fate dearly to&#xD;
purchase experience of my own weak-&#xD;
ness and of the earl's treachery. Sever-&#xD;
al weeks elapsed in this manner, and&#xD;
still did the earl neglect to fulfil the&#xD;
promises he had made me, while, at the&#xD;
same time, the ardor of his passion&#xD;
seemed to increase, and the excuses lhe&#xD;
made for delaying our nuptials, were so&#xD;
plausible, that I was deceived by them.&#xD;
Alas! the woman whose heart has been&#xD;
sincerely attached to any particular ob-&#xD;
ject, is made an easy dupe!  Let me&#xD;
pass hastily over the time, until the an-&#xD;
niversary of the day of my birth, at once&#xD;
the height of my misery, and the means&#xD;
of restoring me to reason and to peace.&#xD;
On that occasion, Mansville had made the&#xD;
most extensive preperatioiis, for cele-&#xD;
brating it in the most spirited manner.&#xD;
Numerous guests were invited to the vil-&#xD;
la, and the peasants in the neighborhood&#xD;
were also permitted to share in the re-&#xD;
joicings. Among other things, for my&#xD;
especial entertainment, the earl had en-&#xD;
gaged a troop of itinerant players, who&#xD;
were in the neighborhood, to perform a&#xD;
play in the grounds of the villa, which&#xD;
deserves particular mention, as it was&#xD;
the means of restoring me to reason, and&#xD;
saving me from that gulf of destruction,&#xD;
upon the brink of which I stood.&#xD;
Seldom had I felt so melancholy as I&#xD;
did on that occasion; home and all its&#xD;
ranquil pleasures, came vividly to my&#xD;
ecollection, and my heart was heavy.&#xD;
There was a song which was a great fa-&#xD;
vourite in the village where I was born,&#xD;
nd which described the pleasures of&#xD;

'Where I learnt other lessons I ought&#xD;

sorrows. I     '&#xD;
'Pray speak freely to me, Miss,' ob-&#xD;
served Celia; 'though humble, you'll&#xD;
not find me insincere.'&#xD;
' Celia,' I remarked, 'if you knew&#xD;
what a home, what parents I had left,&#xD;
you'd pity me.'&#xD;
'I do pity you, Miss,' replied Celia,&#xD;
'indeed I do.  Better days will come;,&#xD;
you'll beas happy as when you left&#xD;
them.'&#xD;
I sighed, and shook my head with a&#xD;
look of despair, and then detailed to&#xD;
Celia the particulars of my flight from&#xD;
home, and the promises which the earl&#xD;
had made, but had hitherto failed to&#xD;
keep his word.&#xD;
' Be of good cheer, Miss, I pray,'&#xD;
said Celia, 'he will keep it, depend up-&#xD;
on it.'&#xD;
Celia spoke this with such a tone of&#xD;
confidence, that it forcibly struck me,&#xD;
and eagerly I exclaimed:-&#xD;
'Will he, Celia?-Now, don't trifle&#xD;
with me-tell me the worst at once!-&#xD;
Better is present death, than hope de-&#xD;
ferred; still lingering on, still doomed&#xD;
to be deceived.'&#xD;
'My dearest young Mistress,' return-&#xD;
ed Celia, 'there is plenty of time before&#xD;
you think of dying; and, as a proof that&#xD;
the earl don't mean to deceive you, look&#xD;
here.'&#xD;
And with these words, Celia present-&#xD;
ed me with a miniature of the earl, ele-&#xD;
gantly set round with diamonds, at the&#xD;
same time, adding:-&#xD;
' On a chamber-maid's penetration,&#xD;
this nothing more or less than an earn-&#xD;
est of the original.'&#xD;
I took the miniature with transport,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
with admiration. Nothing could be&#xD;
more true than the delineation,&#xD;
'Ah!' I observed, 'precious to the&#xD;
fond one, is the semblance of the object&#xD;
held most dear. 'Tis the enchanter's&#xD;
wand, which gathers around it in a ma-&#xD;
gic circle, sweet recollections and feel-&#xD;
ings which make memory a paradise!-&#xD;
No, no!-treachery could never dwell&#xD;
in such a face !-I'll trust him still. He&#xD;
cannot mean me false.'&#xD;
'Shall I put this away, Miss?' asked&#xD;
Celia, pointing to the village dress; 'I&#xD;
am sure the earl would be hurt to see&#xD;
it here.'&#xD;
'Yes, take it away,' Celia, I replied,&#xD;
'I would not, for the world, do any-&#xD;
thing to make him uneasy.'&#xD;
Celia immediately obeyed, and she had&#xD;
not been gone many minutes, when St.&#xD;
Clair entered the room, and advanced&#xD;
joyfully to meet me.&#xD;
' Ah, sir,' I ejaculated, 'why over-&#xD;
whelm me with gifts like these?-My&#xD;
humble habits shrink from such magni-&#xD;
ficence! This (pointing to the minia-&#xD;
ture,) is the only one I prize, the herald&#xD;
of a gift to follow, which shall restore&#xD;
me to my friends, my self-esteem;-my&#xD;
poor heart-broken parents.'&#xD;
The earl turned away his head, doubt-&#xD;
less to conceal the embarrasment which&#xD;
my words occasioned him, and then, in&#xD;
a tone which showed that he wished to&#xD;
change the subject, said:-&#xD;
'This is your birth-day, Clara.'&#xD;
That word tore my wounds open!&#xD;
Oh! what a joyous day was it when I&#xD;
was at home! The farm seemed to be&#xD;
one smile of joy;-the sacred halo of&#xD;
a parent's blessing descended on me with&#xD;
the morning sun; and even my birds,&#xD;
&#xD;
and my eyes became rivetted upon it I my flowers, my young companions,--&#xD;

&#xD;
all seemed to have a livelier look, and&#xD;
lift their heads rejoicing. These thoughts&#xD;
were too painful for my feelings; and I&#xD;
burst into tears.&#xD;
'Nay, Clara,' observed the   earl,&#xD;
'cheer thee, love!-banish that woe;&#xD;
discard that dread; rely upon my pro-&#xD;
mise.'&#xD;
'Heaven's smile repay that word,' I&#xD;
exclaimed fervently; 'the weight which&#xD;
pressed me to the earth is removed, and&#xD;
all around me breathes extacy.'&#xD;
'It delights me to hear thee say so,&#xD;
my dearest Clara,' replied the earl, 'go,&#xD;
sweetest, and put on your richest dress&#xD;
to celebrate this joyous day.'&#xD;
'That day,' I added, with enthusiasm,&#xD;
'that day which gives me back to hon-&#xD;
or. It shall be done, my lord.'&#xD;
The earl kissed me affectionately, and&#xD;
left the room; and once more a cheering&#xD;
hope brought consolation to my heart,&#xD;
and assured me of future happiness and&#xD;
joy.  Alas! how soon was I to be&#xD;
awakened to the greatest agony! To&#xD;
more misery than I had ever before ex-&#xD;
perienced. ,1&#xD;
The festivites of the day passed off&#xD;
most brilliantly until the play commenc-&#xD;
ed. The gardens in which it took place&#xD;
were brilliantly illuminated, and the&#xD;
temporary theatre was formed among&#xD;
the trees in the back. Just as the per-&#xD;
formances were about to commence, a&#xD;
servant entered and delivered to the&#xD;
earl a letter, upon perusing the contents&#xD;
of which, he excused himself to me and&#xD;
the numerous guests, it being necessary&#xD;
that he should be absent for a short&#xD;
time; but he begged that his absence&#xD;
might not interrupt their pleasure, as&#xD;
the village actors- would amuse them&#xD;
with their humble efforts; and ere they&#xD;
had ended, he would return,&#xD;
&#xD;
When the earl aad gone, I beckoned&#xD;
Celia over to me, and the play immedi-&#xD;
ately commenced-; but what were my&#xD;
feelings of intense agony as it proceed-&#xD;
ed, when I perceived that the plot, and&#xD;
every incident of the piece, so corres-&#xD;
ponded with my own circumstances, that&#xD;
it seemed as if they had actually chosen&#xD;
me to sketch the heroine from. A. no-&#xD;
bleman wooed a peasant girl; he vowed&#xD;
the most unbounded affection for her;-&#xD;
promised her marriage, if she would&#xD;
but elope with him;-she was persua-&#xD;
ded;-she sunk senselesss in his arms,&#xD;
and was conveyed away.&#xD;
During the time the piece was being&#xD;
played, my anguish was insupportable,&#xD;
and I was so worked upon by the power&#xD;
of each scene, that I could scarcely&#xD;
persuade myself but that it was reality.&#xD;
'Fatal resemblance,' I ejaculated, at&#xD;
the passage where the seducer bears his&#xD;
victim away; 'has there before been&#xD;
such another deluded being?'&#xD;
'Be calm, dear mistress, be calm,&#xD;
said Celia, 'it is only a play.'&#xD;
But my thoughts were too intently&#xD;
fixed upon the scene which followed, to&#xD;
pay any particular attention to her words&#xD;
The parents of the betrayed one, as re-&#xD;
presented in the piece, upon hearing the&#xD;
screams of their daughter, rushed on to&#xD;
the stage, the father demanding of his&#xD;
wife the meaning of the alarm, and the&#xD;
cause of the cries he had heard. The&#xD;
mother looking round, and finding that&#xD;
her daughter was not there, exclaim-&#xD;
ed:   -&#xD;
'My child! my child!-A  mere pre-&#xD;
tence-our darling -lost - escaped!&#xD;
Ah! there! there! behold the seducer&#xD;
bearing her away!'&#xD;
'Ah! . cried the father, frantically,&#xD;
' what fled? given up to shame?-Oh,&#xD;
&#xD;
art beyond belief! IWave all your fond&#xD;
professions come to this? Oh, well-laid&#xD;
plan !-Lost! lost!-Oh, viper !-hypo-&#xD;
crite !--I tear you from my bosom!-&#xD;
I sweep you from the home you have&#xD;
disgraced! A father's curse -'&#xD;
With a wild shriek, as the actor gave&#xD;
utterance to these words, I rushed upon&#xD;
the stage, and falling at his feet, I vo-&#xD;
cifera-ted, in tones that made the place&#xD;
re-echo again:-&#xD;
'Hold! hold!--curse her not! She&#xD;
is not lost! She is innocent!'&#xD;
At this moment the earl entered, and&#xD;
the whole of the spectators seemed&#xD;
petrified to the spot with astonishment.&#xD;
' Ahi' cried Mansville, 'what do I&#xD;
see?-What is the meaning of this?'&#xD;
Celia raised me from the posture I&#xD;
had assumed, and by the commands of&#xD;
the earl, whose confusion and chagrin&#xD;
was evident, she led me to my own&#xD;
chamber, while the guests quickly dis-&#xD;
persed, and the entertainments abruptly&#xD;
ceased.&#xD;
After I had been taken to my own&#xD;
apartment for a few minutes, by the&#xD;
kind attention of Celia, I recovered my-&#xD;
self, and addressing myself to her,&#xD;
said:--_&#xD;
'Thanks! thanks! a thousand thanks!-&#xD;
I grieve to have troubled you thus-'tis&#xD;
over now; 'tis nothing.'&#xD;
' The earl, Miss! the earl!' exclaim-&#xD;
ed Celia, and the next moment Mans-&#xD;
ville stood before me. There was an&#xD;
expression of sternness upon his brow&#xD;
which I had never seen before, and he&#xD;
seemed greatly agitated. I was alarm-&#xD;
ed, and advancing towards him, said:-&#xD;
'Oh, my lord, how shall I apologize&#xD;
for----"&#xD;
'No more of that,'he interrupted;&#xD;
''tis past.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'My lord,' ejaculated I, surprised.&#xD;
'Leave us, Celia;' commanded the earl,&#xD;
and when the former had retired from&#xD;
the room, he turned to me, and the in-&#xD;
dignation of his looks seemed to in-&#xD;
crease.&#xD;
' Oh, Mansville,' I observed, 'how&#xD;
have I deserved this indifference? Is it&#xD;
my fault that my feelings overcame me?&#xD;
Is it my fault that the scene revived my&#xD;
sense of duty? Oh, my lord, it is those&#xD;
fatal feelings that have made me what&#xD;
I am.'&#xD;
' I am weary of this parade of sensibi-&#xD;
lity,' replied the earl, impatiently; 'you&#xD;
have called up against me the laugh of&#xD;
my tenantry and domestics-let that&#xD;
content you.'&#xD;
'What does the change portend?&#xD;
This freezing look-this language of re-&#xD;
proach?' I inquired.&#xD;
'For your own sake and mine press&#xD;
me no further, Clara,' replied the earl;&#xD;
'I would not have had the scene which&#xD;
has just past occur for millions. If you&#xD;
have placed yourself in unpleasant cir-&#xD;
cumstances, common policy should at&#xD;
least teach you to shun the sneers of&#xD;
the world; but it is over and nothing&#xD;
can now be said which will not increase,&#xD;
instead of diminishing our mutual n-&#xD;
easiness.'&#xD;
A burning pang shot through my&#xD;
brain as Mansville gave utterance to&#xD;
these words, and emphatically and hys-&#xD;
terically I exclaimed--&#xD;
'Am I deceived?'&#xD;
'I cannot tell what childish hopes&#xD;
you may have indulged,' returned the&#xD;
earl, with the most freezing coldness,&#xD;
'and I am only sorry that you should&#xD;
have been weak enough to deceive your-&#xD;
self.'&#xD;
' Oh, no, my agitation has shaken my&#xD;

averted his head.-                  strained me, and bursting with anguish,&#xD;

'Yes, she sleeps,' she said. 'Poor,&#xD;

know what I shall do to keep awake.&#xD;
suppose I finish the new drawing the&#xD;

by so much admiring-that's just the&#xD;
thing.'&#xD;
Celia placed the drawing-stand before&#xD;
her, and sitting down, applied herself&#xD;
to her task; but it was evident, by her&#xD;
frequent nodding, that her words would&#xD;
soon be verified, and I was most anx-&#xD;
for it to happen so, as I had formed a&#xD;
resolution to make my escape from the&#xD;
villa that night by some means or other.&#xD;
She once more approached the couch,&#xD;
&#xD;
she fell back in her seat, fast asleep.&#xD;
I now hastily arose, and attired my-&#xD;
self in the village dress I had gazed at&#xD;
with such feeings of pain and regret in&#xD;
the morning. I approached Celia on&#xD;
tip-toe, and being certain she was really&#xD;
asleep, I soliloquized-&#xD;
' Yes, she sleeps! Now is the only&#xD;
moment! I thought I could not brave&#xD;
a father's eyes; but there is courage in&#xD;
despair, which makes the weak frame&#xD;
wonder at itself. I hava written this&#xD;
letter to the earl, and here are all his&#xD;
gifts-his diamonds,his detested wealth.&#xD;
Now, methinks, my heart feels lighter.&#xD;
Yes, like the prodigal, I will turn my&#xD;
steps where a child may always look&#xD;
with confidence. I have been impru-&#xD;
dent, but am not guilty. Ieaven re-&#xD;
ceives the offering of the sincerely peni-&#xD;
tent, and can a parent's blessing be de-&#xD;
nied when Heaven forgives?'&#xD;
The apartment upon which my cham-&#xD;
ber opened, and in which Celia was, was&#xD;
a magnificent one. On one side was a&#xD;
large French window, through which the&#xD;
distant country could be seen far beyond.&#xD;
Outside was a balcony overhanging the&#xD;
road. I undrew the curtains softly, and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7315-00000048"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
opened the window. It was a fine moon-&#xD;
light night, and the distant landscape&#xD;
could be seen as distinctly as at broad&#xD;
day. I took a scarf from the shoulders&#xD;
of Celia, which she wore, fastened one&#xD;
end of it to the balcony railing, then re-&#xD;
turned, made an appeal to Heaven for&#xD;
protection, and blew out the candles.&#xD;
With more firmness than might have&#xD;
been expected, i then began my perilous&#xD;
descent, and gradually letting myself&#xD;
down by the scarf, alighted in safety&#xD;
below. Fear of being re-taken lent&#xD;
speed to my feet, and I flew with the&#xD;
greatest rapidity across the country to&#xD;
which, however,I was complete stranger.&#xD;
I scarcely abated my speed in the least&#xD;
for the distance of five miles or more,&#xD;
when I was obliged to pause, in order to&#xD;
rest myself. I looked fearfully around&#xD;
me to see whether or not I was pursued,&#xD;
and then reflected upon what course I&#xD;
should pursue. I feared to travel at'&#xD;
that hour, and, indeed, it would have&#xD;
been most dangerous, to a young girl&#xD;
especially ; I therefore resolved to pro-&#xD;
ceed for some distance further, and then&#xD;
to seek shelter at some cottage till the&#xD;
morning. I then resumed my lonely&#xD;
journey in a state of fear and agitation,&#xD;
it is unnecessary for me to describe.&#xD;
After walking for above an hour longer,&#xD;
I arrived at a small and obscure hamlet,&#xD;
and by the light which I perceived in&#xD;
several of the cottage windows, I was&#xD;
satisfied that some of the inmates had&#xD;
not retired to rest.&#xD;
Here, again I paused, for uncertain&#xD;
of the reception I might meet with, I&#xD;
almost feared to knock. At length, I&#xD;
approached the first one, and having&#xD;
first listened at the door, and hearing&#xD;
only the voice of an old woman, appar-&#xD;
ently in prayer, I became more confident,&#xD;
&#xD;
and having waited till she had ceased,&#xD;
I knocked, and shortly afterwards, the&#xD;
voice of the old woman demanded who&#xD;
was there, and what they.wanted. I in-&#xD;
formed her, and begged that she would&#xD;
admit me. It was some time before she&#xD;
complied, and seemed to be consulting&#xD;
within herself the propriety or safety of&#xD;
doing so, but having put several more&#xD;
questions to me, as to whether I was&#xD;
alone, &amp;amp;c., she at last ventured to open&#xD;
the door, and eyed me narrowly from&#xD;
head to foot. She was a very clean,&#xD;
motherly-looking woman, whose appear-&#xD;
ance called the tears to my eyes, she&#xD;
was so much like the parent to whom I&#xD;
was returning.&#xD;
'Good gracious, child,' he said, 'what&#xD;
causes you to be out at this time of&#xD;
the night and from whence do you come?'&#xD;
' I am a stranger in this part of the&#xD;
world, my good dame,' I replied; 'I&#xD;
have recently made my escape from vil-&#xD;
liany, and crave a shelter in your cottage&#xD;
till the morning. I have sufficient to&#xD;
reward you for your trouble.'&#xD;
',As for reward,' returned the old wo-&#xD;
man, 'I require none; and if your story&#xD;
is true, you are heartily welcome to the&#xD;
humble bed I have to offer you.'&#xD;
I thanked the poor woman most sin-&#xD;
cerely for her kindness, and entered the&#xD;
clean little parlor, where the remains of&#xD;
her humble repast she had been partak-&#xD;
ing of, was still upon the table, and of&#xD;
which she requested me to eat, but I de-&#xD;
clined. Judging from her manners and&#xD;
appearance that she was one in whom I&#xD;
could confide, I gave her a brief account&#xD;
of my situation, and upon what purpose&#xD;
I was bent. She listened to me with&#xD;
evident commiseration, and'applauding&#xD;
the resolution I had formed, after some&#xD;
conversation, she conducted me to the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO. '&#xD;
&#xD;
room in which she was able to accoma-&#xD;
date me, and after bidding me goodnight&#xD;
left me to myself. Fatigued with the&#xD;
events of the day, it was not long ere I&#xD;
fell asleep, and I did not awake until the&#xD;
old woman aroused me late in the morn-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Haviug been prevailed upon by her to&#xD;
partake of her humble meal, and offered&#xD;
her some remuneration for her kindness&#xD;
which she persisted in declining, I took&#xD;
leave of her, and made my way to the&#xD;
coach office, to which she had directed&#xD;
me. I met with no interruption on the&#xD;
road, and succeeded in obtaining a place&#xD;
in one of the coaches just starting for&#xD;
my native village. I alighted from the&#xD;
coach a short distance from my place of&#xD;
destination, having made up my mind&#xD;
to walk the rest of the way.&#xD;
I cannot adequately portray the na-&#xD;
ture of my feelings as I approached the&#xD;
home where I had never known anything&#xD;
but happiness until my meeting with&#xD;
Mansville; alternate hopes and fears&#xD;
racked my bosom. It was a beautiful&#xD;
morning; the sun shone forth in full me-&#xD;
ridion splendor, and all nature seemed&#xD;
to wear a smile of gladness.  When I&#xD;
came within sight of the village, my&#xD;
heart felt ready to burst, and suddenly&#xD;
the sound of pipes and tabors vibrated&#xD;
on my ears. Presently afterwards,o&#xD;
bridal procession approached toward:&#xD;
the spot where I was, and stopped be&#xD;
fore the doors of one of my female com&#xD;
panions, Ellen Greenley, and Georg(&#xD;
Ashburne, who had long been her ac&#xD;
knowledged lover.&#xD;
George Ashburne having thanked hi&#xD;
friends for their kindness, the father o&#xD;
Ellen joined them.&#xD;
'Good morning to you, my dear child&#xD;
said Mr. Greenley, kissing his daughte&#xD;
&#xD;
affectionately, and smiling upon his son-&#xD;
in-law elect, kindly ; 'may this prove a&#xD;
blessed day to you both. Go, lads and&#xD;
lasses, and gather the flowers to cele-&#xD;
brate the ceremony.'&#xD;
The villagers departed, and Mr. Green-&#xD;
ley continued-&#xD;
I'll try if I can't prevail upon Mr.&#xD;
Heywood, the unfortunate father of Cla-&#xD;
ra, to come to your wedding; poor fel-&#xD;
low! he may be compared to the ruined&#xD;
wing of the crazy old mansion-house he&#xD;
was converted into a farm, that looks&#xD;
down in gloomy silence upon the bright&#xD;
and smiling landscape which everywhere&#xD;
surrounds it. Ali! that sad girl! the&#xD;
flowers they go to gather are less frail&#xD;
than she has proved. My children be&#xD;
virtuous if you would be happy.'&#xD;
Thus saying, the old man re-entered&#xD;
the cottage, but his words had been so&#xD;
many daggers to my heart.&#xD;
'Clara's father,' observed Ellen, when&#xD;
her father had left them, 'ah! if our&#xD;
poor Clara herself were only here now,&#xD;
how her heart would rejoice in our hap-&#xD;
piness.'&#xD;
' Don't name her, Ellen,' said George,&#xD;
'don't name her ; a virtuous girl's lips&#xD;
ought not to-be sullied by the mention&#xD;
of her name.'&#xD;
' Ah! George,' replied Ellen, 'pity&#xD;
a becomes the virtuous, and the more she&#xD;
s has fallen, the more she deserves to be&#xD;
- pitied.'&#xD;
-   'Psha!' cried George, 'can't you talk&#xD;
e about something else?'&#xD;
'A  sad day jt was when shc went&#xD;
away,' continued Ellen, 'everybody was&#xD;
s downcast, as if some great affliction had&#xD;
f befallen the village.'&#xD;
'More fools they,' was George's ab-&#xD;
,' rupt retort; ' if you or I had gone, in-&#xD;

MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
Ellen, you shall not talk any more about&#xD;
her. Come, come, let us be going.'&#xD;
Suddenly accumulating all my forti-&#xD;
tude, I emerged from the place where I&#xD;
had concealed myself, and called upon&#xD;
Ellen by name. Both her and her lover&#xD;
started, and the former exclaimed in a&#xD;
tone of astonishment and alarm:-&#xD;
'Bless us! what's that?'&#xD;
'As I live,' said her lover, 'it is Cla-&#xD;
ra Heywood, or her ghost!'&#xD;
'Do not be alarmed, Ellen,' I said,&#xD;
' but one word with you.'&#xD;
'No, it's she herself, as I'm alive,'&#xD;
ejaculated Ellen: 'but oh, how changed&#xD;
she is.'&#xD;
'One word, dear Ellen,' I repeated.&#xD;
'I am not satisfied upon this subject,'&#xD;
said the timid George, 'so, as you seem&#xD;
resolved to stay here, I shall be off.'&#xD;
'Ellen,' I repeated, as soon as George&#xD;
had departed 'Have you forgotten me?'&#xD;
'No, Clara, no,' answered the affec-&#xD;
tionate girl, 'nor never shall forget you.&#xD;
I was even talking about you, as you&#xD;
called. Ah! Clara, you're sadly alter-&#xD;
ed; and so is everything since you went&#xD;
away. Such a day as it was, when you&#xD;
left us !-There wasn't a dry eye, nor a&#xD;
cheerful word spoke in the village.&#xD;
Your poor father-'&#xD;
'YWell--well!' I hurriedly interrupted.&#xD;
I igee it grieves you,' said Ellen; 'I&#xD;
didn't-mean to make you sad-you look&#xD;
as if you had suffered enough. This is&#xD;
my wedding-day, Clara.'&#xD;
'Ellen sighed, and for a moment&#xD;
averted her head.&#xD;
'Yes, Ellen,' I resumed, 'I wish to&#xD;
see my mother, and to see her privately.&#xD;
She would not, perhaps, admit me to&#xD;
her presence, if she was not forewarned.&#xD;
You can oblige me greatly, if you will&#xD;
induce her to come to me, by saying that&#xD;
&#xD;
a stranger desires to speak with her, im-&#xD;
mediately.'&#xD;
'That I will, with all my heart,' said&#xD;
Ellen. ' and may it turn to good. Oh,&#xD;
may all the realization of her hopes at-&#xD;
tend the returning wanderer. But where&#xD;
shall I find you?'&#xD;
I'll follow you,' I answered, '' go&#xD;
round to the front door ; I'll take the&#xD;
opposite side, and meet you at the gate.&#xD;
And Heaven will help the heart, deter-&#xD;
mined to retrace the paths of rectitude&#xD;
and honor,' I cried, as with a heart&#xD;
beating with hope and dread, I made&#xD;
my way towards the house of my belov-&#xD;
ed parents.&#xD;
Oh, never shall I forget the feelings&#xD;
with which I entered at the gate.&#xD;
'Here is my home I-my blessed, bles-&#xD;
sed home!' I reflected; 'a frowning form&#xD;
appears to guard the threshhold, shriek-&#xD;
ing in my ear-' Hence! thou shalt not&#xD;
enter!' But can I linger here?-Iseem&#xD;
to tread the earth like a criminal. I&#xD;
must, and I will approach! Now, now&#xD;
now!' °.-&#xD;
Having at last made a violent effort&#xD;
to conquer my emotions, I rushed down&#xD;
the steps into the yard, and then exclaim-&#xD;
ed triumphantly-&#xD;
'Once more I am surrounded by all&#xD;
that is dear to me!-Father! mother!&#xD;
-your unhappy child, sorrowing, im&#xD;
ploring, returns to you!-And hark! I&#xD;
hear, the song of my childhood floating&#xD;
on the air. How accutely doth its ac-&#xD;
cents strike upon my heart in such a&#xD;
scene as this, around whose every tree&#xD;
and flower some recollection of infancy's&#xD;
entwined.'&#xD;
My heart rose in my mouth, as I ven-&#xD;
tured, seeing the coast clear, to approach&#xD;
the house, and even-to peep into the&#xD;
parlor-window. I trembled; and an in-&#xD;

i&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
describable pang shot through my frame,&#xD;
as I noticed everything that well-known&#xD;
room contained, and which had not un-&#xD;
dergone any alteration since I last be,-&#xD;
held it,. But how shall I describe my&#xD;
feelings, when immediately afterwards,&#xD;
the door of the inner apartment was&#xD;
thrown open, and the next moment my&#xD;
mother appeared with the breakfast&#xD;
things. With what eager fondness did&#xD;
I gaze upon her revered countenance,&#xD;
and yearn again to be enfolded in her&#xD;
embrace ; and most severely did I re-&#xD;
proach myself when I noticed the heavy&#xD;
marks of care that were upon her brow.&#xD;
The casement was partially open, so&#xD;
that I could hear all that passed, and&#xD;
my mother, having placed the breakfast&#xD;
things on the table, sighed heavily and&#xD;
observed-&#xD;
'There, there 1-There's the breakfast&#xD;
ready for my poor husband, and now I&#xD;
wish he would return. He has been out&#xD;
since daylight with his gun ; the only&#xD;
thing that seems to attract his attention.&#xD;
At home, all day he does nothing but&#xD;
sigh, or,-if he thinks he is not observ-&#xD;
ed,-weep. Oh, Clara! unthinking girl&#xD;
you have too much to atone for. How&#xD;
long he stays.'&#xD;
My heart was ready to burst as these&#xD;
words reached my ears, and-it was with&#xD;
the greatest difficulty I could avoid be-&#xD;
traying myself. My mother now came&#xD;
to the door an  looked anxiously out,&#xD;
but a little thatched summer-house close&#xD;
at hand .concealed me from observation.&#xD;
Again she entered the house, and I over-&#xD;
heard her, in tones of the deepest anxie-&#xD;
ty, exclaim'--&#xD;
'No, I cannot catch even a glimpse of&#xD;
him, yet my mind is'never easy in his ab-&#xD;
sence; his despondency sometimes makes&#xD;
me fear that-ah! surely yonder I see&#xD;

Yes, 'tis he-he is just at the bridge;-&#xD;
he comes!'&#xD;
'Never shall I forget the sensation&#xD;
with which I strained my eyes in the di-&#xD;
rection which the observation of my mo-&#xD;
ther instructed re in, and I thought I&#xD;
should have sunk to the earth with min-&#xD;
gled feelings of the most intense anguish&#xD;
and awe, when my eyes once more be-&#xD;
held my father. But oh, how altered&#xD;
was he ! Care had deeply imprinted&#xD;
its furrows on his cheeks, and his form&#xD;
was bent and attenuated. He walked&#xD;
with a feeble step, and at least twenty&#xD;
winters seemed to have passed over his&#xD;
head since I had last beheld lim.&#xD;
' My God!' I mentally ejaculated,&#xD;
'and are these the terrible consequences&#xD;
of my imprudence? Oh, my poor moth-&#xD;
er, truly did you say that I had much to&#xD;
atone for!-How can I ever make suffi-&#xD;
cient reparation for the misery I have&#xD;
occasioned.'&#xD;
My father at length reached the house,&#xD;
and my mother ran affectionately to&#xD;
meet him.&#xD;
' You were wrong to have wandered&#xD;
so far,' she said, ' you seem quite ex-&#xD;
hausted.'&#xD;
'No,' replied my father, ''tis only ex&#xD;
ercise that can divert the mind from&#xD;
gloom; When the mind's disturbed, the&#xD;
body does not feel fatigued. I'm late&#xD;
I hope you haven't waited breakfast for&#xD;
me.'&#xD;
'I would not certainly breakfast with-&#xD;

'Well, well, as you please,' said my&#xD;
father, ' where is Edwin?'&#xD;
' He has gone to make one of the&#xD;
wedding party of Ellen and George,' an-&#xD;
swered my mother.&#xD;
A wedding!' said my father, with a&#xD;
sigh, ' ah.'      .&#xD;
My mother had by this time hastily&#xD;
gathered up the breakfast things, and&#xD;
left- the parlor.&#xD;
'Poor, bereaved mother,' sighed my&#xD;
father, looking after her with the most&#xD;
poignant sorrow, 'she struggles with&#xD;
her grief, and endeavors to impart a joy&#xD;
which neither can. feel; which we nei-&#xD;
ther can know again.-No! no! peace&#xD;
of mind fled with my guilty daughter-&#xD;

ravages time had made in this old man-&#xD;

As he thus spoke he rushed from the&#xD;
room, and my agony was so great that&#xD;
I could not help groaning aloud.  .&#xD;
'Oh! God!' I exclaimed; ' what will&#xD;
become of me?--I shall go- mad!-&#xD;
Would that I had not ventured hither;&#xD;

I had scarcely given utterance to the&#xD;

ND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
words, when the latter approached, and&#xD;
before I had time to speak to her, enter-&#xD;
ed the house observing me, however, and&#xD;
motioning me to remain where I was,&#xD;
and to wait patiently. I cannot do&#xD;
justice to the anxiety of my feelings&#xD;
during the time I was waiting there. A&#xD;
thousand doubts, hopes and fears, flash&#xD;
ed across my brain, and every moment&#xD;
seemed to be an hour. At length, I&#xD;
heard Ellen in joyful accents exclaim,&#xD;
as she came from the house,&#xD;
'Joy, Clara, joy!'&#xD;
I sprang forward with rapture to&#xD;
meet her.&#xD;
'I have succeeded, my dear Clara,&#xD;
said the generQus-hearted girl, exulting-&#xD;
ly; ' she'll come to you. Wait in the&#xD;
summer-house, and she'll be with you&#xD;
presently.'&#xD;
' Thanks! thanks!' cried I, 'a thous-&#xD;
and thanks, my dearest Ellen.'&#xD;
' She's coming,' observed Ellen, eag-&#xD;
erly; 'go, quick. I pray for your suc-&#xD;
cess from the bottom of my soul.'&#xD;
Scarcely had I time to enter the sum-&#xD;
mer-house, when my mother approached.&#xD;
Now was the moment of my trial at&#xD;
hand; a deadly sickness came over me,&#xD;
and it was with difficulty I could save&#xD;
myself from fainting. The next mo-&#xD;
ment my mother entered the summer-&#xD;
house, and she no sooner beheld me,&#xD;
than she uttered a loud scream of as-&#xD;
tonishment, and becagie, as it were,&#xD;
paralyzed to the spot. '&#xD;
' Mother! mother!' I cried, in frantic&#xD;
tones, 'if I may still call you by that&#xD;
dear name;--oh, pardon your imprudent,&#xD;
but not guilty daughter!'&#xD;
I could say no more, but sank at her&#xD;
feet. ' A pause of several moments en-&#xD;
sued! my mother being too much over-&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN Fl&#xD;
&#xD;
powered by her emotions to speak; but'&#xD;
at length, in a voice choked with agony,&#xD;
she exclaimed:--&#xD;
'Wretched girl! dare you again to&#xD;
approach that home, those parents&#xD;
whose hearts you have rendered deso-&#xD;
late? Guilty, miserable girl-'&#xD;
' Oh, no, no,' I interrupted hastily,&#xD;
'imprudent, cruel, I have been, dear&#xD;
mother, but your child returns to you&#xD;
as pure as when she left you. I appeal&#xD;
to heaven to attest my innocence. Oh,&#xD;
my mother, pardon the- poor prodigal,&#xD;
who erred alone through youth and in-&#xD;
experience, and who is now ready to&#xD;
make all the atonement in her power.'&#xD;
' Can this be true? Have you indeed&#xD;
not endeavored to deceive me?' ejaculat-&#xD;
ed my mother, eagerly,, and her eyes&#xD;
beaming, fixed with a penetrating glance&#xD;
upon my countenance, as though she&#xD;
would read all that was passing in my&#xD;
soul. 'But no, it is impossible. How&#xD;
can you be innocent, uncontaminated?&#xD;
did you not abandon your home, your&#xD;
parents,  and throw yourself into the&#xD;
arms of a villain, who-'&#xD;
' Oh, mother, believe it not,' I return-&#xD;
ed, with the tears at the same time&#xD;
streaming down my cheeks. 'I acknow-&#xD;
ledge that by the most base and subtle&#xD;
means, and in a moment of thoughtless-&#xD;
ness and imprudence, Mansville got me&#xD;
into his power, and bore me far away&#xD;
from my home. But I thought that he&#xD;
meant to act honorably towards me.&#xD;
He told me he would make me his bride.&#xD;
I was too ready to believe him, and day&#xD;
after day he made some plausible ex-&#xD;
cuse to postpone the fulfilment of his&#xD;
promise.  Think not, however, that&#xD;
I suffered nothing. That you were ever&#xD;
absent from my thoughts, or that the&#xD;
fondly cherished recollections of my&#xD;

to torture my mind. Bitter, indeed,&#xD;
were the pangs I endured. Ofttimes&#xD;
would I have fled the place. and return&#xD;
ed hither, but I dreaded to meet the re&#xD;
preaches of my parents. When, how-&#xD;
ever, Mansville threw aside the mask,&#xD;
I overcame that dread, and your unhap-&#xD;
py daughter has come back to solicit&#xD;
your forgiveness, with her virtue as un-&#xD;
sullied as when she left you.'&#xD;
During the time I was speaking, the&#xD;
agony evinced by my mother needs no&#xD;
description, and when I had ceased, in&#xD;
a paroxysm of delirous transport, she&#xD;
snatched me from the earth and enfold-&#xD;
ed me in her arms, exclaiming-&#xD;
' My child-my long lost Clara! Yes,&#xD;
I do indeed believe you, and pardon you,&#xD;
Oh, this is a happiness that I never ex-&#xD;
pected!'&#xD;
' Mother, dear mother!' I cried, in a&#xD;
tone of gratitude and delight which I&#xD;
cannot adequately describe, 'to be suf-&#xD;
fered once more to speak to you in this&#xD;
place-to hear those blest words-to&#xD;
know myself pardoned. My heart is so&#xD;
full. Thus, thus only can I thank you.'&#xD;
Again I threw my arms around her&#xD;
neck, and pressing vehemently to her&#xD;
bosom, she wept tears of joy.&#xD;
' Unfortunate girl,' at length she said,&#xD;
gently withdrawing herself herself from&#xD;
my enthusiastic caresses, 'I believe you&#xD;
innocent; but a mother's heart is more&#xD;
indulgent than the world.  And, ah!&#xD;
there is yet one to be appeased. Hark!&#xD;
I hear footsteps. It is your father.&#xD;
Softly-stand out of sight! He comes,.&#xD;
but must not know you yet.'&#xD;
Hastily throwing a veil over me, my&#xD;
mother urged me into the summer-house,&#xD;
and the next moment my father and the&#xD;
father of Ele1n came from the house.&#xD;

They were in conversation, and by the.&#xD;
words which I overheard, it seemed that&#xD;
the latter had been endeavoring to per-&#xD;
suade my father to join the wedding&#xD;
party.&#xD;
'But at any rate,' said he, 'for half&#xD;
an hour you might.'&#xD;
'No,' returned my father, mournfully,&#xD;
'I should only mar the festal hour. I&#xD;
am the scathed tree of the heath that&#xD;
cannot drop. The bolt that struck off&#xD;
'my branches has left my old trunk erect&#xD;
in wretched loneliness.'&#xD;
Tis a shame, neighbor,' observed&#xD;
his companion, 'it - is a shame, I say,&#xD;
for a strong mind like yours to give it-&#xD;
self up to sorrow in this way. You&#xD;
might as well put a pistol to 'your head&#xD;
at once, for you will be sure to kill&#xD;
yourself by it, sooner or later, and self-&#xD;
murder in one form is quite as criminal&#xD;
as in another.'&#xD;
'When you have seen the being for&#xD;
whom you've lived,' retorted my father,&#xD;
' the object of every solicitude-the&#xD;
child you've  reared with  unceasing&#xD;
watchfulness, wrenched from you by.a&#xD;
villian's grasp, then come to me and talk&#xD;
of patience, and I'll listen.'&#xD;
'Well, well, I'll not weary, you any&#xD;
longer,' observed Mr. Greenly; ' from&#xD;
my soul I'm grieved to see you thus&#xD;
abandoned to fruitless sorrow. Fare-&#xD;
well, my friend, and may days be at&#xD;
hand when we shall see you smile once&#xD;
more.'&#xD;
Thus saying, and grasping the hand&#xD;
of uimy father most cordially, the father&#xD;
of Tllen 'etired through the gate.&#xD;
'Smile,' soliloquized the former, ashi&#xD;
friend  left him; 'smile! Oh, happy&#xD;
father!-happy to see his daughter saf&#xD;

bane of wealth. I once hoped tha&#xD;

such a fate would beam on me; but fate&#xD;
was jealous. Lost, lost, wretched girl !'&#xD;
While mine unhappy father was thus&#xD;
speaking, my mother entered the sum-&#xD;
mer-house, and leading me forth, she&#xD;
placed her finger on her lips to enjoin&#xD;
me to silence.  We stood aside, and&#xD;
watched him, unobserved.&#xD;
'As I gaze there,' he continued, 'me-&#xD;
thinks I see her in her days of innocence,&#xD;
when first her little steps began: laugh-&#xD;
ing, she ran, with arms extended towards&#xD;
me; then I trembled lest her young feet&#xD;
should fail, and she should fall. But&#xD;
she passed through those, fearful times&#xD;
unharmed. She escaped those thousand&#xD;
dangers. Now. she falls-falls, to the&#xD;
earth, never to rise! She's gone-she's&#xD;
lost! My Clara! Oh, my child!'&#xD;
My heart was ready to burst, and I&#xD;
was almost choked with endeavouring&#xD;
to repress the heavy sobs that heaved&#xD;
my bosom. My father threw himself in-&#xD;
to a chair, and my mother advanced to-&#xD;
wards him, and touched him on the shoul-&#xD;
der.&#xD;
'A tear,' she observed, in gentle ac-&#xD;
cents. 'Did I not hear our Clara's name&#xD;
too? Did not your lips utter the name&#xD;
of our child?'&#xD;
'No, no,' he replied, hastily rising;&#xD;
'let us, if possible, not think or speak&#xD;
of her again.'&#xD;
'Well, well, dearest husband,' return-&#xD;
ed my mother, 'I will not urge it now;&#xD;
but here is a poor creature, the daugh-&#xD;
ter of-'&#xD;
'Away---away!' hastily and vehement-&#xD;
ly interrupted my unhappy parent. '.I&#xD;
s have no daughter now.'&#xD;
'No,' replied my mother; 'but this re-&#xD;
e pentant child, the daughter of a neigh-&#xD;
a bor, is on her way to ask forgiveness of&#xD;
t her offended father. She faints with&#xD;

&#xD;
shame and grief, and dares not meet&#xD;
him. Do speak a word or two of com-&#xD;
fort to her, and teach her in what words&#xD;
she should address him to gain his bless-&#xD;
ing, and to sooth his anguish.'&#xD;
'None,' replied my father, hastily,&#xD;
and his eyes beaming wild, 'none. Let&#xD;
her not dare to look upon him. Let not&#xD;
her presence insult the home her infamy&#xD;
has disgraced. Perhaps, too, she had a&#xD;
mother, rich in every virtue. Let her&#xD;
shun that mother, for contamination is&#xD;
in her touch. Virtue can hold no in-&#xD;
tercourse with vice, though vice, with&#xD;
double baseness, kneels affecting rever-&#xD;
ence for virtue.'&#xD;
I found it impossible to help groaning&#xD;
aloud, as I listened to my father's obser-&#xD;
vations, and I threw myself into my mo-&#xD;
ther's arms. He turned his eyes stead-&#xD;
ly upon me for a minute or so, and then&#xD;
resumed--&#xD;
'Yet hold! I will not judge too harsh-&#xD;
ly;,for there are shades of guilt, and&#xD;
her's, perhaps, may not be of so deep a&#xD;
dye as to preclude forgiveness. Perhaps&#xD;
her father was not affectionate- Per-&#xD;
haps (poor child!) he was morose and&#xD;
frigid. Perhaps neglectful, cold, unin-&#xD;
dulgent.'&#xD;
'Oh, no!' I sobbed, and sank on my&#xD;
knees before him with clasped and up-&#xD;
raised hands,-' he was most kind, affec-&#xD;
tionate, and good.'&#xD;
'What,' eagerly demanded my poor&#xD;
parent, 'did he love you better than all&#xD;
the world?-did he rear you in domestic&#xD;
tenderness, and train you in the paths&#xD;
of virtue?-did he clasp you to his dot-&#xD;
ing heart, and in his foolish pride pro-&#xD;
claim his child the paragon of earth?-&#xD;
and did you then blast all of his fond&#xD;
hopes, and clinging to another, leave&#xD;
him in his storm of grief?'&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Again I groaned with the almost in-&#xD;
supportable power of my anguish, and&#xD;
still remained on my knees before him.&#xD;
'Dearest husband,' said my mother,&#xD;
'do not aggavate the dear child's mis-&#xD;
ery. She is repentant--she is the shorn&#xD;
lamb, temper the storm to her affliction,&#xD;
but do not add another wound to a&#xD;
heart already too much lacerated.'&#xD;
' Well, well,' returned my father, ' be&#xD;
it so. I will forget my own, and try&#xD;
to sooth her sorrows. Young woman,&#xD;
rise.'&#xD;
He raised me from the earth, and&#xD;
taking my hand tenderly, continued:-&#xD;
' What your miseries are, I well can&#xD;
guess; but what'your father's sufferings&#xD;
are I too well know. You fear to meet&#xD;
his eye; you dread to hear his curse. A&#xD;
father's curse is heavy; shall I paint this&#xD;
agonizing suffering to you, child! I can&#xD;
do so; for I have felt it. I have it now.&#xD;
I once.had a daughter.'&#xD;
' Ob, sir, do not name her!' I cried,&#xD;
with a feeling of agony, too powerful&#xD;
for utterance.&#xD;
' Oh, how I doted on that daughter,f&#xD;
he continued, and his countenance be-&#xD;
trayed the terrible mental agony he was&#xD;
enduring. 'How I adored her, words&#xD;

' Ha!' groaned my father, as he recog-&#xD;
nised me and retreated from me, 'away!&#xD;
away! away!'&#xD;
In a wild delirium of agony, I follow-&#xD;
ed him on my knees, exclaiming, in fran-&#xD;
tic accents,-&#xD;
'Your vengeance cannot make you&#xD;
deaf to the agony of a despairing child;&#xD;
behold me on my kiees; I bring the sac&#xD;
rifice of a broken spirit. I do not ask&#xD;
your love till you know I am worthy of&#xD;
being loved. I do not ask your confi-&#xD;
dence -till you feel I can be trusted; but&#xD;
do not deny me the shelter of your pa-&#xD;
ternal roof.'&#xD;
' My father spurned me violently from&#xD;
him, and ashe did so, he cried, in hoarse&#xD;
tones,-&#xD;
'H ence! hence!-I know you not!&#xD;
My sight rejects you-spurns you! If&#xD;
you have wasted all the spoils of guilt,&#xD;
there-there's gold! Your idol, gold!&#xD;
for which you bartered all your hopes of&#xD;
bliss!'&#xD;
He dashed a purse furiously to the&#xD;
earth as he spoke, and hastened towards&#xD;
my mother, fixing upon me looks of scorn&#xD;
and hatred. Oh, Heaven! how each&#xD;
glance penetrated to my soul! How&#xD;
every word burnt to my heart! It was&#xD;
wonderful that reason could retain her&#xD;
empire in that trying scene.&#xD;
'Father! father!' I implored, with re-&#xD;
doubled vehemence, 'hear me, I beseech&#xD;
you.'&#xD;
'Husband, dearest husband!' suppli-&#xD;
cated my mother, 'hear her, she is inno-&#xD;

Your child is still virtuous-still unpol-&#xD;
luted; her only crime has been in loving&#xD;
one too fondly, who sought to betray"&#xD;
her! In the name of Heaven, I assert&#xD;
my innocence, and if I speak not the&#xD;
truth, may its most awful vengeance de-&#xD;
scend upon my head! But you cannot,&#xD;
you will not, longer doubt me. I see&#xD;
you will not! Oh, bless you for this,&#xD;
father, father!'&#xD;
I could say no more; but sobbing con-&#xD;
vulsively, I threw myself into his arms!&#xD;
He wept;-yes, I could feel his chest&#xD;
heave with the power of mental anguish,&#xD;
and the big round tear of sorrow 'fell&#xD;
from his eye upon my cheek; he pressed&#xD;
me with all the fervour he had ever been&#xD;
wont to do to his heart, and ere he pro-&#xD;
nqnnced it, I knew that I was forgiven.&#xD;
'My child! my Clara!' he at last cri-&#xD;
ed, ' is it possible that I again hold you&#xD;
innocent to my bosom? But no, the&#xD;
the bliss is too great to be real! And&#xD;
yet it is her! yes, it is my child; it is&#xD;
her lips that have asserted her innocence&#xD;
and appealed to Heaven to attest it, and&#xD;
I can no longer doubt! Oh, happiness&#xD;
supreme !   My long - lost, reclaimed&#xD;
child ! Receive a parent's thanks.'&#xD;
He could say no more for a minute or&#xD;
two, but again did he clasp me with ec-&#xD;
stacy to his bosom, and weep tears of&#xD;
gratitude upon my cheek. Then he&#xD;
would, withdrawing himself from me,&#xD;
with an expression I find it impossible&#xD;
to describe, gaze in my countenance, and&#xD;
clasping his hands together, raised them&#xD;
towards Heaven, in humble thanksgiving&#xD;
for its goodness in restoring me, uncon-&#xD;
taminated to his arms; while my poor&#xD;
mother's emotion was equal to his own,&#xD;
and she gazed on the scene with a sensa-&#xD;
tion of the deepest gratitude and joy.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'But where is the villain who has&#xD;
been guilty of this outrage?' he at length&#xD;
demanded; 'let me hasten to him, and&#xD;
demand satisfaction for the wrongs he&#xD;
has done us; the many days and nights&#xD;
of bitter misery he hascaused your un-&#xD;
fortunate parents! Tell me to what in-&#xD;
sult, what anguish did he expose you?&#xD;
I am mad to hear the guilty tale!'&#xD;
'Pray defer it, my dear husband, till&#xD;
your feelings are more composed;' said&#xD;
my mother.&#xD;
' No, no, no,' hastily ejaculated my&#xD;
father, and with the greatest impatience&#xD;
depicted in his countenance.  'I will&#xD;
hear it now! I will no longer hesitate!'&#xD;
In as few words as possible, I com-&#xD;
plied with my father's request, and re-&#xD;
lated all the particulars of the earl's&#xD;
conduct to me during the time I was in&#xD;
his power." During the recital, the vio-&#xD;
lent agitation of my father was plainly&#xD;
visible, and when I had. concluded, he&#xD;
walked backwards and forwards for a&#xD;
short time, with disordered steps, and&#xD;
muttering incoherent sentences to him-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
At length he turned to me, and clasp-&#xD;
ing me vehemently to his bosom, ex.&#xD;
claimed:-&#xD;
'My child!,--my own one!-my still&#xD;
innocent Clara!-Can I longer doubt&#xD;
you?' Oh, no! you are restored to my&#xD;
arms; guiltless as when in a moment of&#xD;
imprudence you was snatched away from&#xD;
your paternal roof! Oh! God! I thank&#xD;
you for this! The trial has been a hea-&#xD;
vy onel But my child has withstood&#xD;
the temptation, the artifices of the liber-&#xD;
tine, and the tempter, and I am again&#xD;
happy! Bless you, bless you, my Cla-&#xD;
ral-Oh, I was too severe to imagine for&#xD;
a moment that you could be the guilty&#xD;
being I supposed you to have become!-&#xD;
&#xD;
Bless you againI!-Here in this fond&#xD;
embrace!--This kiss of fervent affection,&#xD;
let me at once seal your pardon for the&#xD;
indiscretion of which you were guilty.&#xD;
We will never again part, till death&#xD;
shall interpose between us.'&#xD;
Thus saying he snatched me fervently&#xD;
to his heart, and imprinted warm kisses&#xD;
upon my cheeks, my lips, my temples!&#xD;
How shall I describe the feelings that&#xD;
rushed through my veins at that mo-&#xD;
ment? Language is by far too weak to&#xD;
do justice to them. They must be left&#xD;
to the warm imagination of the suscept-&#xD;
ible reader!--I was unable to return&#xD;
any answer; emotion choked my utter-&#xD;
ance, and stifled the words of ecstacy&#xD;
that would otherwise have flowed from&#xD;
my lips. Again I felt the ardent em-&#xD;
brace of that father whose forgiveness&#xD;
I had despaired of ever being able to&#xD;
obtain; once more I felt the glow of&#xD;
his kiss upon my lips, and heard him&#xD;
pronounce his forgiveness for the many,&#xD;
many hours of bitter agony, of doubt,&#xD;
of fear, I had caused him.-Surely an&#xD;
age of anguish would have been trifling&#xD;
to purchase such a few moments of bliss,&#xD;
of exquisite transport, as those I then&#xD;
experienced. Again and again he en-&#xD;
folded me to his heart, and wept: like&#xD;
a child did the poor old man weep tears&#xD;
of inexpressible joy and gratitude upon&#xD;
my bosom. My mother, too; what pen&#xD;
could sufficiently depicture her emotions&#xD;
upon that occasion.-She joined my&#xD;
father in the embraces he bestowed up-&#xD;
on me, and then we all three knelt, and&#xD;
with hearts of sincerity, poured forth&#xD;
our gratitude to that Omnipotent being&#xD;
who had thrown the Almighty shield of&#xD;
His protection around me in hours of&#xD;
such eminent peril, and restored me in-&#xD;
bocent to the home wherein I had pass-&#xD;

and besides, the result of. such an act,&#xD;

' Clara!' observed my father, 'think&#xD;

have received from the Earl Mansville ?&#xD;
Oh, my child, did you but know, could&#xD;

years I had slept, and gazed upon eve-&#xD;
ry well known object, which had under-&#xD;
gone no perceptible change since I had&#xD;
before reposed in it. It seemed indeed,&#xD;
to have been unoccupied since the time I&#xD;
had been from home; and every. article&#xD;
I looked upon, appeared not to have&#xD;
been disturbed. There was the same lit-&#xD;
tle clean bed, with its furniture arrang-&#xD;
ed with such admirable care and precis-&#xD;
ion-the humble toilet-and everything&#xD;
the same as when I had last used it.&#xD;
There was the prayer book, the one&#xD;
which had been presented to me by my&#xD;
father many years before, and in which&#xD;
was inscribed his name, with the leaf&#xD;
turned down at the particular prayer&#xD;
I remember to have used the night be-&#xD;
fore my elopement. With a heart over-&#xD;
flowing 'with gratitude, I knelt down,&#xD;
and fervently breathed that prayer, and&#xD;
to it added one of thanks to Heaven, for&#xD;
the manner in which I had been saved&#xD;
from the sorrow and disgrace with which&#xD;
I had been threatened, and invoked its&#xD;
blessings on the heads of my parents and&#xD;
my brother. Then, with a lighter heart&#xD;
than I had experienced for many a day,&#xD;
I retired to my couch, and soon fell off&#xD;
into a calm slumber. No painful vision&#xD;
haunted my imagination that night; my&#xD;
dreams were those of bliss. Of the joys&#xD;
of home, and the affection of adoring pa-&#xD;
rents; and in the morning I awoke to a&#xD;
renewal of that happiness and content,&#xD;
which had ever been mine before I be-&#xD;
came acquainted with the Earl of Mans-&#xD;
Ville.&#xD;
But what were my sentiments now as&#xD;
regarded Mansville ? Need I try to&#xD;
portray them?  I am certain that I&#xD;
need not! They were fully embodied in&#xD;
the observations I had made use of to&#xD;
my father. The mask which the deceiv-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
er had thrown off, having shown me his&#xD;
character in its real light, I thought of&#xD;
him only with disgust and abhorrence,&#xD;
and had he even then offered to make&#xD;
all the reparation in his power, by be-&#xD;
stowing upon me his hand, I felt confi-&#xD;
dent that I should have rejected it with&#xD;
scorn.- Great as had been my trial, and&#xD;
painful as had been the circumstances&#xD;
by which it had been attended, I felt I&#xD;
had no cause to regret it now, but, on&#xD;
the contrary, to feel, in a manner thank-&#xD;
ful that it did occur, as it had taught&#xD;
me a a lesson I shall never forget, and&#xD;
had afforded me that experience in the&#xD;
deceptive practices resorted to by the&#xD;
the -wealthy and unprincipled of man-&#xD;
kind, which would prevent me for the fu-&#xD;
ture from approaching the precipice of&#xD;
destruction, down which I was so near&#xD;
being plunged.&#xD;
I arose the following morning at the&#xD;
early hour to which I had been accustom-&#xD;
ed, and found my father, mother, and&#xD;
brother, already assembled in the little&#xD;
parlor, and the morning's repast spread&#xD;
upon the table. I could perceive, as&#xD;
soon as I entered, that they had been&#xD;
discussing something particular, and it&#xD;
was not long ere I was made acquainted&#xD;
with it. I found that my father and my&#xD;
brother had come to the determination&#xD;
of going to the Earl Mansville, in spite&#xD;
of my entreaties, and the observations I&#xD;
had the previous day made use of, to in-&#xD;
duce them to abandon their design, and&#xD;
such Was their eagerness to see Mans-&#xD;
ville, and demand an explanation of him,&#xD;
that they had resolved not to delay&#xD;
any longer than the following day.&#xD;
' I fully appreciate your motives, my&#xD;
dear child,' said my father, 'but, after&#xD;
mature deliberation, I cannot consent&#xD;
to comply with your wishes. Were we&#xD;
&#xD;
to suffer the matter to rest where it is&#xD;
it would be yielding a cowardly submis-&#xD;
sion to guilt, which my heart revolts&#xD;
from; and, moreover, would give the&#xD;
foul tongue of slander an opportunity of&#xD;
propogating surmises derogatory to your,&#xD;
reputation. No, nothing will satisfy me,&#xD;
but a plain acknowledgment of his guilt,&#xD;
and your innocence from his own lips,&#xD;
and a sufficient apology 'to satisfy the&#xD;
world at large. Were I to seek repa-&#xD;
ration in a court of law, his wealth and&#xD;
high rank would be a sure protection for&#xD;
him.'&#xD;
'It would,' coincided my brother,&#xD;
' and I see no other means of obtaining&#xD;
any satisfaction than the course we are&#xD;
about to pursue.'&#xD;
In this opinion, my mother coincided,&#xD;
and, much as I dreaded the consequen-&#xD;
ces that might attend it, I was at a loss&#xD;
for arguments to combat their resolu-&#xD;
tions. This day passed away in the same&#xD;
manner as the previous one, and the fol-&#xD;
lowing morning, after a most affection-&#xD;
ate farewell, my father and brother took&#xD;
their departure by the coach, for the&#xD;
mansion of the Earl Mansville.&#xD;
After my father and brother had left,&#xD;
my mind underwent several gloomy pres-&#xD;
ages, and though I perfectly agreed with&#xD;
the propriety of the arguments my fath-&#xD;
er had made use of, I could not but sin-&#xD;
cerely regret that they had not aban-&#xD;
doned their design.&#xD;
My mother endeavored to sooth me&#xD;
by all the arguments in her power; and&#xD;
said that, doubtless Mansville, for his&#xD;
own credit's sake, would be ready to&#xD;
make all the reparation that was in his&#xD;
power.&#xD;
'Alas!1' thought I, ' what recompense&#xD;
can he make me for the injury he has in-&#xD;
flicted on my peace of mind? Noth-&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
ing can make amends for the pain of&#xD;
discovering that the only object upon&#xD;
which we have placed all our young&#xD;
heart's warmest affections is base,treach-&#xD;
erous, and unworthy of that passion;&#xD;
and I now as thoroughly despised Mans-&#xD;
ville as I had before loved him, for that&#xD;
he had thrown a blight upon my mind&#xD;
from which I could never thoroughly&#xD;
recover.&#xD;
We expected the return of my father&#xD;
and brother in about three or four days&#xD;
from the time they had left home, as&#xD;
they would have nothing to detain them&#xD;
after they had obtained the interview&#xD;
they sought with the Earl Mansville, as&#xD;
they were fully aware that if they pro-&#xD;
tracted their presence, it would excite&#xD;
our utmost alarm. The fourth and fifth&#xD;
day, however, elapsed, and still they re-&#xD;
mained absent. Our apprehensions be-&#xD;
gan to be excited in the utmost degree,&#xD;
and all the fearful forebodings that had&#xD;
before haunted my mind, returned with&#xD;
redoubled force.&#xD;
In spite of all her efforts to appear to&#xD;
the contrary, the fears of my mother,&#xD;
were, if possible, more excited than my&#xD;
own, and conjecture was exhausted in&#xD;
vain, to endeavor to account for the pro-&#xD;
crastination of their return.&#xD;
Another day elapsed in this manner,&#xD;
and yet we heard nothing of them, and&#xD;
then, indeed, our terrors was aroused to&#xD;
an almost insupportable pitch, and we&#xD;
no longer sought to disguise from each&#xD;
other the real state of our feelings upon&#xD;
the agonizing subject. I expressed to&#xD;
my mother all those forebodings I had&#xD;
before indulged in, and she could not&#xD;
but admit the too great probability of&#xD;
them. Now did she join with me in&#xD;
deeply regreting that my father and&#xD;
brother had not yielded to my advice,&#xD;

oIr that she should have made one to&#xD;
urge .the propriety of the course they&#xD;
had taken. What step to pursue we&#xD;
were at a loss to conceive.&#xD;
'I cannot wait in this horrible state&#xD;
of suspense any longer,' my mother ejac-&#xD;
ulated, when the seventh day dawned,&#xD;
and we heard no tidings of them; 'I'll&#xD;
instantly take G--m, and learn at&#xD;
once the cause of this mysterious delay,&#xD;
and whether or not anything has hap-&#xD;
pened to them. This dreadful state of&#xD;
doubt and suspicion is worse than the&#xD;
most terrible certainty.'&#xD;
She had scarcely-given utterance to&#xD;
these words when a knock was heard at&#xD;
the outer door, and a letter was present-&#xD;
ed to my mother, which she knew imme-&#xD;
diately to be in the hand-writing of her&#xD;
husband. Trembling violently with ap-&#xD;
prehension, she broke the seal, but had&#xD;
not read more than two lines when, with&#xD;
a piercing scream, she fell senseless to&#xD;
the floor. I-flew to her, raised her in&#xD;
my arms, and then, taking up the fatal&#xD;
letter, began to read the contents. The&#xD;
commencement of it was enough to&#xD;
smite my heart with horror; and it is&#xD;
marvellous how, under such trying cir-&#xD;
cutnstances, I retained possession for an&#xD;
instant of my faculties. My unfortu-&#xD;
-nate father and brother were in goal,&#xD;
accused of murder-of the murder of&#xD;
my deceiver, the Earl Mansville!i&#xD;
My frantic cries soon brought the&#xD;
servants of my father to the room, who&#xD;
immediately conveyed my mother to her&#xD;
chamber, while I was reduced to such a&#xD;
state by the shock which my feelings&#xD;
had sustained, that it-was found neces-&#xD;
sary to call in medical advice to me, as&#xD;
well as the former. I remained in a&#xD;
state of almost utter unconsiousness for&#xD;
several days, during which period I con-&#xD;
&#xD;
tinually raved of the murdered Mans-&#xD;
ville, and the awful charge which: I'&#xD;
would fain have believed my unhappy&#xD;
parent and brother were innocent of ;&#xD;
but which, under peculiar circumstan-&#xD;
ces, seemed, alas! but too probable.&#xD;
My mother had been restored to com-&#xD;
parative composure much earlier than&#xD;
might have been anticipated from the&#xD;
violence of the shock her feelings had&#xD;
received; and when I regained my sen-&#xD;
ses, I found that she had started, the&#xD;
day following the one on which she had&#xD;
received the fatal letter, for G--m,&#xD;
to seek an interview with her wretched&#xD;
husband and son, and to obtain an ex-&#xD;
planation of the horrible circumstances.&#xD;
The person who attended me had the&#xD;
utmost difficulty in persuading me not&#xD;
to follow her; and it was only by the&#xD;
determined tone in which the medical&#xD;
man spoke, stating that the consequen-&#xD;
ces of such a journey, in my then state&#xD;
of mind, might be productive of the most&#xD;
fatal results, that I was prevented from&#xD;
putting my wishes into effect.&#xD;
Too soon, alas! the horrible particu-&#xD;
lars reached my ears, which I will pro-&#xD;
ceed to relate as they were afterwards&#xD;
detailed by my father.&#xD;
It appeared that after my father and&#xD;
brother had left home, they immediately:&#xD;
repaired to the coach-office, ,where they&#xD;
had booked their places the evening be-&#xD;
fore, and took their departure for&#xD;
G- m, whither they arrived the even-&#xD;
ing without anything occurring worthy'&#xD;
of being particularly noticed. As. it&#xD;
was rather late, they resolved not to vis.&#xD;
it the earl till the morning, and accord-&#xD;
ingly took up their lodgings at an inn&#xD;
in the place. Not feeling disposed to&#xD;
-go to rest for the present, they thought&#xD;
they would take a bit of a walk in the&#xD;

MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
mevere!-It is really wonderful how I&#xD;
have found strength of mind to endure&#xD;
them all; how one so young, and, until&#xD;
lately, a complete stranger to misery,&#xD;
should be able to bear up tinder such an&#xD;
almost unprecedented accumulation of&#xD;
horrors. But my troubles were far from&#xD;
being yet complete.&#xD;
The unfortunate Mansville was mor-&#xD;
tally wounded, and breathed his last be-&#xD;
fore morning, never having rallied from&#xD;
the first, and having been unable to&#xD;
speak after he was first discovered.&#xD;
And here must I pause to reflect upon~&#xD;
the terrible fate of the Earl Mansville;&#xD;
as I do so, the remembrance of his&#xD;
faults, and his conduct towards me, are&#xD;
forgotten in the one strong and irresist-&#xD;
ible feeling of pity which inhabits my,&#xD;
breast. His fate was marked 'by the&#xD;
most - signal retribution of Heaven.&#xD;
The week following that of his assassi-&#xD;
nation, he was to be united to a young,&#xD;
beautiful, and wealthy heiress, to whom&#xD;
he had been paying his devoirs, at the&#xD;
same time he Was pleading the most&#xD;
powerful passion for me, and most so-&#xD;
lemnly' protesting, from time to time,&#xD;
that he would make me his bride. Ill-&#xD;
fated, but guilty Mansville! Heaven&#xD;
pardon you for the deception of which&#xD;
you were guilty, as I now do.&#xD;
My father and Edwin underwent se-&#xD;
veral examinations before the justices,&#xD;
and evidences of their guilt appeared so&#xD;
numerous, that few, if any, attempted&#xD;
to defend them.&#xD;
It was well known in what manner&#xD;
they were related to me, and the circum-&#xD;
stances under which I had been placed&#xD;
with the murdered Mansville, and, there-&#xD;
fore, what had brought my father and&#xD;
brother to G--m, but to seek revenge?&#xD;
Besides, it was proved by the landlord&#xD;
&#xD;
of the inn where they had taked lodg-&#xD;
ings, that they had left his house at a&#xD;
late hour in the evening together, and,&#xD;
that, previous to doing so, he had a&#xD;
conversation with them, in course of&#xD;
which they had asked several strange&#xD;
questions respecting the deceased Earl&#xD;
Mansville, which were quite sufficient&#xD;
to strengthen the suspicions that were&#xD;
already excited against them; and more&#xD;
particularly they had made several in-&#xD;
quiries as to the nearest way to the&#xD;
murdered nobleman's mansion, and had&#xD;
been directed the exact way in which&#xD;
they had been discovered. An inquest&#xD;
was held upon the deceased, the jury&#xD;
upon which tunhesitatingly returned a&#xD;
verdict of wilful murder against my&#xD;
father and brother; and ultimately they&#xD;
were committed to the assizes for trial.&#xD;
This was precisely the state of the af-&#xD;
fair, when we received the letter which&#xD;
was from ray father; need it, therefore,&#xD;
excite any astonishment that our feelings&#xD;
were almost maddening?-The circum-&#xD;
stantial evidence against them was very&#xD;
strong, and alas! how many innocent&#xD;
persons had suffered under far less sus-&#xD;
picious circumstances?-The idea was&#xD;
enough to freeze the blood with horror,&#xD;
and here again did I find cause most bit-&#xD;
terly to reproach myself for one act of&#xD;
indiscretion which had thus been pro-&#xD;
ductive.of this awful misery, and might&#xD;
be the occasion of bringing my father&#xD;
and brother to an awful and ignomin-&#xD;
ous fate, for a crime of which they were&#xD;
entirely innocent.&#xD;
The day after this, I received a letter&#xD;
from my mother, in which she described,&#xD;
in language I should fail to do adequate&#xD;
justice to, were I to try, the interview&#xD;
she had had with her husband and son&#xD;
at the gaol in which they were confined,&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
but sought to inspire me with hope that&#xD;
something would take place to establish&#xD;
their innocence, and bring the real per-&#xD;
petrators of the horrid crime to justice.&#xD;
I tried to think so too. Never, I re-&#xD;
flected will the Almighty suffer two in&#xD;
nocent beings to suffer for the sanguin-&#xD;
ary crime of the real assassin! They&#xD;
will be saved,,and the monster who has&#xD;
committed this atrocious crime brought&#xD;
to that punishment which his guilt mer-&#xD;
its.'&#xD;
These were but for a short time my,&#xD;
reflections, then would the heavy weight&#xD;
of circumstantial evidence, which would&#xD;
be adduced against them on their trial,&#xD;
recur to my memory, and despair would&#xD;
again begin to settle upon my heart.&#xD;
My mother mentioned in her letter&#xD;
that the assizes were expected to com-&#xD;
mence in about a fortnight, and that,&#xD;
until the result of this awful affair was&#xD;
known, she intended to reside near the&#xD;
gaol, so that she might be enabled to&#xD;
visit the unfortunate prisoners every&#xD;
day. She added; that, if I thought my-&#xD;
self capable of the task, and able to sup-&#xD;
port an interview, I might also repair to&#xD;
the spot, leaving the farm for the time&#xD;
we were absent to the care of Ellen and&#xD;
her husband. To remain where I was,&#xD;
alone, with no one but Ellen to offer me&#xD;
the least consolation'or advice, I fel t&#xD;
would be worse than death; and, there-&#xD;
fore, having made a powerful effort to&#xD;
conquer my emotions, I arranged the&#xD;
business with Ellen and her husband,&#xD;
and with the prayers of my friends for&#xD;
the happy termination of the trial, I&#xD;
set forward upon my melancholy jour-&#xD;
ney.&#xD;
What tongue could give utterance to&#xD;
the intense agony of my feelings, when&#xD;
the coach arrived at G--m, the place&#xD;
&#xD;
115&#xD;
&#xD;
which I had so lately quitted to seek&#xD;
the forgiveness of my parents. Alas!&#xD;
under what different, what horrible cir-&#xD;
cumstances did I now return to it. He&#xD;
who had'first tempted me to act wrong&#xD;
had met with an untimely fate, and my&#xD;
father and brother the inmates of a pris-&#xD;
on, accused of his assassination.&#xD;
The day after my arrival at G--m,&#xD;
I had an interview with my unfortunate&#xD;
relatives, but I must pass over that&#xD;
deeply agonizing scene; I cannot recall&#xD;
it to my memory without harrowing up&#xD;
my feelings. They both, however, at-&#xD;
tempted to appear more composed than&#xD;
I might have expected them to have&#xD;
been, and endeavoured to inspire me and&#xD;
my mother with the most sanguine hopes&#xD;
as to the result of the trial. We, how-&#xD;
ever, could see but very little to excite&#xD;
any such ideas, and although, for the&#xD;
sake of calming their feelings, we pre-&#xD;
tended to place some reliance in what&#xD;
they said, we were very far from actual-&#xD;
ly entertaining any such feelings.&#xD;
I will pass over the time which inter-&#xD;
vened previous to the trial, and come at&#xD;
length to the morning on which the fate&#xD;
of all my family, I might say, depended.&#xD;
The hall of justice was densely crowded,&#xD;
and the trial excited the most uncom-&#xD;
mon interest. Myself and my mother&#xD;
were accomodated with seats near the&#xD;
dock in which the accused were, and&#xD;
whenever, by chance, I happened to look&#xD;
up, I caught the eyes of the, spectators&#xD;
fixed alternately upon me and my mo-&#xD;
ther; but in the brief glance which I suf-&#xD;
fered myself to take, I beheld that the&#xD;
expression with which they contemplat-&#xD;
ed us was more of pity than any other&#xD;
feeling.&#xD;
I know not how it was, but I felt a&#xD;
degree of firmness on that awful occasion&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7315-00000057"/>&#xD;
116&#xD;
&#xD;
MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
which I never thought it would be in&#xD;
my power to assume, and my mother&#xD;
was perfectly calm and resigned. As&#xD;
for the prisoners, their whole demeanour&#xD;
showed the dignified firmness of perfect&#xD;
innocence, and a firm reliance on the&#xD;
goodness of Providence for the issue.&#xD;
The jury having been called over and&#xD;
sworn, the trial commenced, and the&#xD;
charge having been made, my father and&#xD;
brother both answered in a firm voice to&#xD;
the usual interrogatory put to them, as&#xD;
to whether they were guilty or not guil-&#xD;
ty--&#xD;
'Not guilty!'&#xD;
The trial then proceeded, which is&#xD;
quite unnecessary for me too recapita-&#xD;
late.&#xD;
The jury retired to consider their ver-&#xD;
dict-and oh, God! what a moment o&#xD;
horrible suspense was that! All eyes&#xD;
were turned alternately upon me and&#xD;
my mother, and then the prisoners ii&#xD;
the dock. But the latter were as firmn&#xD;
as if they had only been spectators them&#xD;
selves, and frequently turned upon me&#xD;
and my poor mother glances that were&#xD;
meant to encourage us.     '&#xD;
The jury were absent about twenty&#xD;
minutes, which seemed as many hourE&#xD;
to those who-weie so deeply and pain&#xD;
fully interested in this important trial&#xD;
and at length they returned into th&#xD;
court.&#xD;
The foreman of the same, in a deel&#xD;
voice said-.&#xD;
'GUILrY!'&#xD;
An appalling shriek followed the pro&#xD;
nunciationiof the verdict;:it proceede&#xD;
from ing another, who sank insensible i&#xD;
my arms.- It essemed at that time as.&#xD;
I were endowed with superhuman pow&#xD;
er; my faeulties were all restored to  m&#xD;
atid I was enabled to support with' firn&#xD;
&#xD;
ness that was most extraordinary. The&#xD;
verdict had fallen upon my ear, in aman,.&#xD;
ner of speaking, with complete indiffer-&#xD;
ence, and, it appeared as if a voice at&#xD;
that moment whispered to me hope in-&#xD;
stead of despair. - But I feared to look&#xD;
at my father and his unhappy son. I&#xD;
was apprehensive that their bare glance&#xD;
of horror and despair would be sufficient&#xD;
to deprive me of my senses. The judge&#xD;
. then proceeded to pass sentence of death,&#xD;
but ere he had utteredhalf-a-dozen words&#xD;
a gentleman suddenly arose from his&#xD;
seat, and with his whole frame convulsed&#xD;
with emotion, exclaimed-&#xD;
' Hold my lordI!-proceed not to sen-&#xD;
tence men who are entirely innocent of&#xD;
the charge.&#xD;
After the lapse of a minute or two&#xD;
f for the court to recover themselves from&#xD;
the confusion into which this event had&#xD;
thrown them, the judge demanded of&#xD;
the gentleman the meaning of his inter-&#xD;
ruption.&#xD;
'In a few words, it is this,' said the&#xD;
gentleman, ' you behold before you an&#xD;
unhappy wretch, who ought to have&#xD;
been placed in the dock now occupied&#xD;
by those much injured, and wrongly ac-&#xD;
s cused men. Nay, you may well be sur-&#xD;
- prised, and it willjdoubtless be increas-&#xD;
, ed, when I  tell you that .in me you be-&#xD;
e hold the actual murderer of the Earl&#xD;
Mansville, and I, therefore demand that&#xD;
p justice be done upon me!'&#xD;
Nothing could now equal the extra-&#xD;
ordinary sensation which prevailed, and&#xD;
- it was at first, no doubt, immagined by&#xD;
d many that the gentleman's feelings who&#xD;
n ha- thus .denounced himself had been&#xD;
if worked upon and excited by the circum-&#xD;
r- stances of the trial, and' that insanity&#xD;
, had suddenly seized-upon his brain; but&#xD;
a- they were soon convinced of the contra-&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
'I-&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
ry, for the self-accused having paused&#xD;
awhile to suffer the excitement to sub-&#xD;
side, continued-&#xD;
'It 'was this hand which perpetrated&#xD;
the hellish deed upon the unfortunate&#xD;
Mansyille, the pistol which was found&#xD;
by the side of the deceased will be seen&#xD;
to have my initials engraved upon it.'&#xD;
The pistol was here handed up to the&#xD;
judge, when the initials were found.&#xD;
'The awful tale is soon told,' continu-&#xD;
ed he.&#xD;
'The late Earl Mansville and myself&#xD;
had been companions at college. Soon&#xD;
after our return from the university, I&#xD;
formed an attachment to a young lady,&#xD;
and was permitted to pay my addresses&#xD;
to her. This courtship went on for a&#xD;
period of two years, when it was sudden-&#xD;
ly broken off. In vain I sought an ex-&#xD;
planation. Nothing more relative to&#xD;
this affair transpired until about a month&#xD;
ago, when, judge my resentment and sur-&#xD;
prise, to learn that the late Earl Mans-&#xD;
ville, was the admitted lover of the lady,&#xD;
and that their nuptials were actually fix&#xD;
ed to take place on a certain day. On&#xD;
ascertaining the truth of this, I demand,&#xD;
ed an explanation of such extraordinary&#xD;
conduct; but all that I obtained in re-&#xD;
turn, was the most provoking raillery !&#xD;
I quitted the unfortunate nobleman vow-&#xD;
ing the most dreadful vengeance. On&#xD;
the evening that I committed the hellish&#xD;
crime, I quitted my own house, with the&#xD;
pistols now produced in my possession,&#xD;
fully bent to way-lay and murder my ri-&#xD;
val. Once he turned to look round, and&#xD;
then I jumped into a dry ditch, and con-&#xD;
cealed myself. He resumed his journey,&#xD;
and acting under the influence of a sud-&#xD;
nen impulse, I presented the fatal weap-&#xD;
on at him, and fired, just as he prepared&#xD;
to walk on. What followed has already&#xD;
&#xD;
117&#xD;
&#xD;
appeared in the evidence brought against&#xD;
those two men, most wrongfully accused&#xD;
As the day of trial approached, so did&#xD;
my agony increase. Could I be guilty&#xD;
of a three-fold muder? I could not; so,&#xD;
this day, I resolved to be present, and&#xD;
confess. I admit, that my resolution&#xD;
failed me so much, that I was unable to&#xD;
put this into effect, until after the trial&#xD;
had proceeded to the present length;&#xD;
but I have now acquitted my conscience&#xD;
of that additional and heavy sin, and I&#xD;
feel content to abide by the consequen-&#xD;
ces. I repeat that the men in the dock&#xD;
are entirely innocent, and that I only am&#xD;
the murderer of the late Earl Mansvillc.&#xD;
I demand that justice be done, and thus&#xD;
give myself up to this tribunal to be tri-&#xD;
ed and punished by the laws of my of-&#xD;
fended country.'&#xD;
A murmur of surprise, horror, and&#xD;
satisfaction ran through t he court at&#xD;
this remarkable confession, and for a few&#xD;
moments, the business was entirely sus&#xD;
pended. My mother had recovered, and&#xD;
overheard all that had passed. But sud-&#xD;
denly, the court was aroused by all the&#xD;
the judges rising, and declaring it as&#xD;
their unanimous opinion, that the two&#xD;
individuals who had been tried had&#xD;
been charged and convicted by the jury&#xD;
of the murder of the Earl Mansville,&#xD;
were now shown to be clearly innocent,&#xD;
that the court, therefore, annul the ver-&#xD;
dict, and ordering them to be discharg-&#xD;
ed out of custody, command Richard&#xD;
Archibald Holland, to be placed at the&#xD;
bar and indicted, upon his own confes-&#xD;
sion, for the wilful murder of the said,&#xD;
Horatio, Earl Mansville.&#xD;

&#xD;
be longer acquainted; and too soon her&#xD;
heavy afflictions came upon me with&#xD;
overwhelming force. .The shock which&#xD;
my mother's feelings had undergone by&#xD;
the recent events had made fearful in-&#xD;
roads on her constitution, and it soon&#xD;
became too alarmingly apparent, that&#xD;
she was sinking under a rapid decl ine.&#xD;
All the medical resources were o no&#xD;
avail, and she at length yielded to the&#xD;
fearful malady.&#xD;
My father and all of us, were incon-&#xD;
solable for her loss.&#xD;
Only three months after my 'poor&#xD;
mother's death, my- brother was seized&#xD;
with a violent typhus fever, which my&#xD;
father quickly caught of him. A few&#xD;
short months only, consigned those two&#xD;
dear relatives to the grave also. Would&#xD;
that it had pleased the Almighty to&#xD;
take me also, then I should not have&#xD;
.had to undergo the miseries, the degra-&#xD;
dations I have toosmuch reason to fear&#xD;
it is yet my lot to suffer. Illness and&#xD;
incessant trouble had involved my fath-&#xD;
er's affairs in difficulties, from which I&#xD;
found it impossible to extricate them.&#xD;
Let me draw my melancholy recital to&#xD;
a conclusion. Hard necessity drove me&#xD;
at last to seek the protection of rela-&#xD;
t ives, whose jibes and cruelties drove&#xD;
me to the life I now lead) and the letter&#xD;
you brought me was from  the clergy-&#xD;
man of our parish, who having learnt&#xD;
of my whereabouts, addressed me an&#xD;
exhortation to repentance; recalling all&#xD;
the incidents of the bitter past. Here&#xD;
Clara burst into a fresh flood of tears,&#xD;
and owned her intention to quit her pre-&#xD;
sent shameful mode of life.&#xD;
' And 'now, Mr. Monteagle,' continu-&#xD;
ed Clara, 'to prove to you that I am&#xD;
really penitent; I will divulge to you a&#xD;
contemplated crime, which was planned&#xD;
&#xD;
in this very house, and this night it is to&#xD;
be carried into effect. Belcher Kay and&#xD;
Blodget one night killed a rich old dro-&#xD;
ver, and buried him in an old adobe hut.&#xD;
They have since learned that Inez, the&#xD;
daughter of old de Castro, had taken&#xD;
shelter in the building from a storm and&#xD;
witnessed all their proceedings. The&#xD;
Vigilance Committee are already ap-&#xD;
prised of the facts, but in Miss de Cas-&#xD;
tro's terror at the fearful scene, she for-&#xD;
got the names by which they addressed&#xD;
each other; but she is convinced that&#xD;
she will know their persons if ever she&#xD;
meets them. You know these villains&#xD;
will never consent to live in hourly fear&#xD;
of arrest and punishment. They have,&#xD;
therefore, determined to attack the man-&#xD;
sion of de Castro, at the Mission, rob&#xD;
it, and I fear kill his daughter to prevent&#xD;
her appearing as a witness against them.'&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
INEZ CARRIED OFF.&#xD;
IN a public room of a tavern in Paci-&#xD;
fic street, we shall find Belcher Kay. It&#xD;
is night, and-through the thick haze of&#xD;
cigar smoke which filled the room the&#xD;
candles glimmer like distant lights seen&#xD;
through a fog. The close atmosphere of&#xD;
the dirty room is laden with the odor of&#xD;
the said tobacco smoke, and with the&#xD;
fumes of rum and whiskey, and through&#xD;
the hum of noisy conversation and .over&#xD;
the occasional bursts of laughter may be&#xD;
distinguished the ' Hagel und donner' of&#xD;
the Dutchman, the ' sacre' of the French-&#xD;
man, and the imprecations which the&#xD;
Englishman invokes upon his visual or-&#xD;
gans and the crimson tide that circulates&#xD;
through his veins.&#xD;
At one table sat half a dozen sailors,&#xD;
bronzed by the tropical sun of Java, and&#xD;
smoking long pipes with enormous bowls.&#xD;
At another table sat a group of English,&#xD;
French, American and Portuguese, simi-&#xD;
larly engaged, while two other tables&#xD;
were surrounded by Lascars and Malays,&#xD;
who being worshippers of the one race&#xD;
of Brahma, the other of Boodha, choose&#xD;
to sit and drink apart. Mingled with the&#xD;
men at each table were a number of&#xD;
Kanaka and Chilean women, dark-eyed,&#xD;
seductive creatures; all well formed,&#xD;
lithe, and graceful, and of all ages vary-&#xD;
ing from twelve to eighteen years, for&#xD;
beneath the scorching sun of the tropics&#xD;
woman advances towards maturity as&#xD;
quickly as the rich fruits are ripened and&#xD;
the gorgeous flowers expanded into beau-&#xD;
ty. These lost and degraded creatures&#xD;
sat by the side or on the knees of their&#xD;
lovers of the hour, their long, shining&#xD;
black hair falling in plats or ringlets&#xD;
&#xD;
upon their dusky shoulders, and their&#xD;
bosoms very much exposed, and many of&#xD;
them smoked cigars with their male&#xD;
companions.&#xD;
Kay sat apart from the revellers, smok-&#xD;
ing a cigar, with his arms folded across&#xD;
his breast, a moody and sombre expres-&#xD;
sion upon his countenance, and his eyes&#xD;
bent upon the dirty floor. Ile was think-&#xD;
ing of the past-thinking, amid the riot-&#xD;
ous din of jests and oaths, laughter and&#xD;
song, of all that he had been, and of&#xD;
what he might have been, of time mis-&#xD;
spent, and golden opportunities lost, of&#xD;
talents misapplied and energies misdi-&#xD;
rected. It was a mournful retrospect&#xD;
for the man not wholly lost, his heart&#xD;
was not entirely corroded, nor all indur-&#xD;
ated by vice and profligacy, the powers&#xD;
of his mind had not become sapped by&#xD;
the vicious excesses in which he had in-&#xD;
dulged; he was capable of forming a&#xD;
sound judgement of human actions, both&#xD;
his own and those of others; and to look&#xD;
back excited for these reasons, feelings,&#xD;
sombre and mournful. The past of his&#xD;
life was a dreary waste to look back up-&#xD;
on ; he was fully conscious of the fact,&#xD;
he was able to discriminate between'the&#xD;
right and the wrong, and to perceive his&#xD;
errors, and he felt at that moment all the&#xD;
dreariness, the moral void, of the vista&#xD;
upon which lie turned his mental vision.&#xD;
True, the desert was not entirely with-&#xD;
out its oaises; there were green spots&#xD;
breaking the gloomy monotony of its&#xD;
arid and cheerless aspect, but these only&#xD;
deepened by the contrast the impression&#xD;
made by the general barrenness.&#xD;
He was roused from his reverie by the&#xD;
words of a song sung, or rather shouted&#xD;
by one his countrymen-an Englishman&#xD;
-a sailor belonging to a vessel then ly-&#xD;
ing in the harbor. There was nothing&#xD;

to interest him in the words themselves,&#xD;
but they seemed familiar to him, like a&#xD;
voice heard in our youth and half forgot-&#xD;
ten, which we hear again after a long&#xD;
interval of time, and they struck upon.&#xD;
his mind by the force of association. In&#xD;
his boyhood he had heard that song,&#xD;
which had been a favorite chant with a&#xD;
schoolfellow, and the words now called&#xD;
up a thousand recollections of the time&#xD;
when he had first heard them, just as the&#xD;
remembered sound of the church-bells of'&#xD;
our native place will recall such memo-&#xD;
ries when we hear them after long ab-&#xD;
sence from the scenes of our early ex-&#xD;
istence. To the mind of the robber, pre-&#xD;
disposed to reflection, the words of the&#xD;
song recalled the school-room and the&#xD;
play-ground, with many a reminiscence&#xD;
of merry companions and boyish games ;&#xD;
and from these his heart wandered to&#xD;
the home of his childhood, to the little&#xD;
garden into which he had transplanted&#xD;
primroses and cowslips from the woods&#xD;
to the rippling brook upon which he had&#xD;
launched his tiny ships. to the darkly&#xD;
shaded seat under the old elm tree on&#xD;
which he had rested when weary, to the&#xD;
innocent and smiling faces of his fair-'&#xD;
haired sisters-&#xD;
It was not for the first time that Bel-&#xD;
cher Kay, thought of these things-it&#xD;
was not the first time that they had&#xD;
drawn a sigh from his breast ; but, now&#xD;
at that distance of space from the scenes&#xD;
which he visited in thought, the tide of&#xD;
memory rolled over his brain with re-&#xD;
doubled volume and force. A melan-&#xD;
choly pleasure might have been experi-&#xD;
enced in travelling over in thought the&#xD;
scenes of his youth, but for the reflection&#xD;
that between the past and the present&#xD;
rose darkly and frowningly one of those&#xD;
&#xD;
barriers of crime and folly, which such&#xD;
men build up with far more persever-&#xD;
ance thau they would exert to acquire a&#xD;
fame that would endure as long as truth&#xD;
and virtue command respect and admir-&#xD;
ation. Such a barrier had Belcher Kay&#xD;
raised with a diligence and energy which&#xD;
he had never displayed in aught worthy&#xD;
of praise, and from it he now looked&#xD;
back upon the Eden which he had aban-&#xD;
doned, with such feelings as may be im-&#xD;
agined.&#xD;
He was still sitting in the position&#xD;
which has been described when Blodget&#xD;
entered the room, and,.coming up to&#xD;
him, clapped his hand upon his shoulder.&#xD;
Kay started, but looking up, he was re-&#xD;
assured by the recognition of his fellow&#xD;
criminal, and extended his hand, which&#xD;
Blodget grasped with friendly fervor.&#xD;
' Come 1' exclaimed Blodget. 'I have&#xD;
been seeking you everywhere. Let us&#xD;
get away from this.'&#xD;
'I am ready,' responded Kay, rising.-&#xD;
'What's in the wind now, mate?'&#xD;
Blodget made no reply, 'but led the&#xD;
way into the street, followed by Kay.&#xD;
In a few minutes they had left the city&#xD;
behind them, and could hear the hoarse&#xD;
roar of the sea as its waves, after chasing&#xD;
one another over the wild expanse of the&#xD;
Pacific ocean,broke upon the shell strewn&#xD;
beach, and the sighing of the night wind&#xD;
among the bushes. The moon was sink-&#xD;
ing, and the shadows prevailed over the&#xD;
lights, but it was prineipaly the land&#xD;
which lay in shade, while the ocean&#xD;
spread out like an illimitable sheet of&#xD;
silver.&#xD;
After crossing the hills which sur-&#xD;
mount the city the two men gave a loud&#xD;
shrill whistle which in a few moments&#xD;
brought three more desperadoes to as-&#xD;
&#xD;
sist them in their scheme. This was no&#xD;
other than an attack upon the mansion&#xD;
of Senor de Castro with the intention of&#xD;
making themselves masters of the mon-&#xD;
ey and plate to be found on the premises,'&#xD;
and for another purpose which will ap-&#xD;
pear in the course of the narrative.&#xD;
When the five robbers arrived in the&#xD;
vicinity of the house Bloodget proceeded&#xD;
towards it, for the purpose of carrying&#xD;
their plot into execution, while the rest&#xD;
of the party lay closely concealed ready&#xD;
to hasten to the assistance of their asso-&#xD;
ciate the moment such service should be&#xD;
required.&#xD;
'Yes, there is the window; I wonder,&#xD;
now, if she will look out to night said&#xD;
Blodget to himself as he cautiously&#xD;
drew near the house.&#xD;
Blodget took a good look at the win-&#xD;
dow and then slowly glided away under&#xD;
the shadow of a wall.&#xD;
With great tact, Blodget as he did&#xD;
so glided along, kept the little window&#xD;
with the balcony in sight.&#xD;
Now, the little window of the room in&#xD;
which Inez resided, was not very far from&#xD;
the ground.&#xD;
That is to say, at all events, the lower&#xD;
portion of its balcony certainly was not&#xD;
above twelve feet from the green sward&#xD;
actually below it.&#xD;
The idea struck Blodget, then, that&#xD;
through teat window he must get, and&#xD;
through it again he must make his way&#xD;
out with his captive.&#xD;
How he meant to overcome the very.&#xD;
many difficulties that still stood in his&#xD;
way, it is impossible to conceive; but he&#xD;
had not come totally unprepared with&#xD;
the means of action.&#xD;
Coiled un in the pockets of the clothes&#xD;
whichL..' e sd worn all the latter part of&#xD;
&#xD;
the day, he had had a couple of ropes of&#xD;
silk, with a hook at the end of each of&#xD;
them.&#xD;
He expected, and not without reason,&#xD;
too, that they would be to him of the&#xD;
very greatest possible assistance.&#xD;
It took him some little consideration&#xD;
before he would venture to cross the bit&#xD;
of lawn that.seperated him yet from the&#xD;
house; and, strange to say, while he was&#xD;
so considering, another circumstance be-&#xD;
gan to operate'in his favor.&#xD;
A soft, but rather thick and penetra-&#xD;
ting rain began to fall.&#xD;
' Aha" he said 'this is capitol. This&#xD;
will clear the ground of all loiterers.&#xD;
This is providential.'&#xD;
Letting the rain continue for some five&#xD;
minutes or so until he considered it had&#xD;
had all its effect, Blodget crossed the&#xD;
lawn, and stood beneath the balcony of&#xD;
the window.&#xD;
Blodget was very acute in his sense of&#xD;
hearing, and he now bent that faculty to&#xD;
the very utmost to listen if any one were&#xD;
moving in the rooms above.&#xD;
All was as still as the very grave.&#xD;
'She has gone to bed,' thought Blod-&#xD;
get. '\Well, I don't care. I must take&#xD;
her away, and take her I will.'&#xD;
A very dim light was close to the win-&#xD;
dow.&#xD;
' I wonder,' thought Blodget, if she&#xD;
will scream before I can get a gag put&#xD;
into her mouth?  If she does, I may&#xD;
have dangers to encounter; but I never&#xD;
yet abandoned an enterprise on that ac-&#xD;
count, nor will I now.'&#xD;
Truly dangerous was a climate in&#xD;
which such a man as Blodget lived.&#xD;
He now looked carefully to the right&#xD;
and to the left of the place of which he&#xD;
was, so as to assure himself that no sen-&#xD;

tiuel was close at hand, and then he bold-&#xD;
lv flung up the cords to which the hooks&#xD;
ware attached, to the balcony.&#xD;
It took him three or four efforts be-&#xD;
fore he succeeded in getting the hooks&#xD;
to hold fast, and then he found that the&#xD;
cords easily suspended him.&#xD;
This was rather a ticklish part of the&#xD;
business to climb up to the' balcony now&#xD;
with the possibility, if not the probabili-&#xD;
ty, that some one might see him; but&#xD;
yet he meant either to do it or abandon&#xD;
the whole affair at once, so he set about&#xD;
it with a feeling that might be said to&#xD;
approach to recklessness._&#xD;
He reached the top of.the parapet of&#xD;
the balcony, and rather rolled over it than&#xD;
stepped over, so that he exposed himself&#xD;
to observation to as small an extent as,&#xD;
under the circumstances, it was-at all&#xD;
possible so to do.&#xD;
There he lay crouched up in the bal-&#xD;
cony, pretty well shaded by its stone&#xD;
work and parapet from any further ob-&#xD;
servation from without.&#xD;
He breathed in rather an agitated man-&#xD;
ner for a few moments, for he had under-&#xD;
gone, to tell the truth, very great person-&#xD;
al exertion.&#xD;
Soon, however, he recovered sufficient-&#xD;
ly to assist him in going on in his enter-&#xD;
prise; and accordingly, sidling along ve-&#xD;
ry carefully till he got quite close to the&#xD;
window, he cautiously tried if it were.&#xD;
fast.&#xD;
No. It yielded to a touch.&#xD;
'More good fortune,' thought"he.&#xD;
Slowly, for it took a good five minutes&#xD;
to do, thinking that any noise now occa-&#xD;
sioned by precipitation would be fatal to&#xD;
him and his project, he got the window&#xD;
open about a couple of feet.&#xD;
He put his hand into the room, and&#xD;
&#xD;
NTD MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
felt that there was a table close to the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
By carefully moving his hand and arm&#xD;
horizontally from left to right and from&#xD;
right to left, he found there was nothing&#xD;
on the table but a glass of water, in which&#xD;
were some flowers.&#xD;
In order to get it out of the way, he&#xD;
lifted the glass into the balcony, and&#xD;
placed it carefully in one corner out of&#xD;
the way.&#xD;
Then it was that the audacious Blod-&#xD;
get, like an oily snake, slid into the room&#xD;
through the partially open window, and&#xD;
was fairly within the apartment.&#xD;
His next step was to remove the table&#xD;
from before the window, and to open the&#xD;
window itself very much wider-in fact,&#xD;
as wide as it would possibly go.&#xD;
Then it was that he saw' where the&#xD;
faint light had come from that was in&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
A little oil night-light was on a brack-&#xD;
et fixed to the wall of the room.&#xD;
That light, although very small in it-&#xD;
self, was yet sufficient to dissipate the&#xD;
'darkness that was in the place, and by&#xD;
it\ Blodget with great satisfaction looked&#xD;
around him, and was quite convinced&#xD;
that he was in the suite of rooms in the&#xD;
occupation of Inez.&#xD;
There was one circumstance that to&#xD;
him was quite convincing on Shat head,&#xD;
for on the chimney-piece was a small&#xD;
but finely painted.miniature of Montea-&#xD;
gle.&#xD;
' Yes,' whispered Blodget, as he drew&#xD;
a long breath, 'I am on the right scent&#xD;
now.,&#xD;
Immediately opposite to the window&#xD;
there was a door that seemed to lead to&#xD;
the next apartment. It was a very tick-&#xD;
lish thing indeed to open that door.&#xD;
&#xD;
Before he could at all make up hisI&#xD;
mind to do so, he tried to peep through&#xD;
the key-hole of it, but, unfortunately,&#xD;
there was on the other side a piece of&#xD;
pendant brass that blocked it up, so he&#xD;
saw nothing.&#xD;
Delay, though, to him now was some-&#xD;
thing worse than danger-it might be&#xD;
fatal; so with a feeling almost of desper-&#xD;
ation, he turned the handle of the door&#xD;
and opened it.&#xD;
It led into a room that was, like the&#xD;
last one, dimly lighted by a night-lamp&#xD;
in a niche in the wall.&#xD;
'.She is fond of light,' thought Blod-&#xD;
get.&#xD;
There was a door in the side wall of&#xD;
this room, and that door was a littleway&#xD;
open.&#xD;
Through it Blodget could see the bed-&#xD;
curtain.&#xD;
The room in which she was, constitu-&#xD;
ted the dressing-room to the bed-room&#xD;
further on.&#xD;
Blodget, with eyes like a hyena, cast&#xD;
a glance round the room. A silk dress&#xD;
was upon a couch, and on the dressing-&#xD;
table were various articles of female ap-&#xD;
parel and jewelry&#xD;
He approached, on tip-toe, the door&#xD;
of the bedchamber, and listened most in-&#xD;
tently.&#xD;
The sound of one breathing rather&#xD;
heavily in sleep, came upon his ears.&#xD;
' She sleeps,' mattered Blodget, ' and&#xD;
my task is consequently all the easier&#xD;
of performance. Yes, she sleeps, and&#xD;
soundly too.'&#xD;
He now took from his pocket a gag&#xD;
made of cork and string, and so con-&#xD;
structed that if once fixed in any one's&#xD;
mouth it would be out of the question&#xD;
for them to utter an articulate sound.&#xD;
This, with a silk handkerchief, which&#xD;

lie intended to fix around the head and&#xD;
face of his prisoner, were the implements&#xD;
with which he hoped to capture Inez,&#xD;
and by the aid of which so to terrify her&#xD;
that he might get away in safety with&#xD;
her.&#xD;
' Now for it,' he said.&#xD;
He took another step towards the&#xD;
door of the bedchamber, and then he&#xD;
hesitated.&#xD;
'A good thought,' he muttered. 'I&#xD;
will put out both the lights, and then no&#xD;
curious eye will see me emerge from the&#xD;
window with my prize.'&#xD;
He crept back and blew out each of&#xD;
the little oil lamps that were in the sep&#xD;
crate rooms.&#xD;
All was darkness then ; but it was evi-&#xD;
dent there was another lamp in the ac-&#xD;
tual bedchamber itself.&#xD;
It was convenient for Blodget that&#xD;
there should be, at all events for a brief&#xD;
space, a light there.&#xD;
'Now courage and impudence assist&#xD;
me,' he muttered.&#xD;
As he spoke he on tiptoe glided into&#xD;
the bedchamber in which he would have&#xD;
wagered his life that Inez now slept.&#xD;
The difficulty, though, he thought was&#xD;
really an truly at an end, when he, as he&#xD;
fancied, found himself so far successful as&#xD;
to be actually in the sleeping chamber of&#xD;
the young lady.&#xD;
No wonder that even he, accustomed&#xD;
as he was to all sorts of escapades and&#xD;
strange eventful proceedings, felt a little&#xD;
affected at his own tenierity when he set&#xD;
foot within the sacred precincts of that&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
The idea of what monteagle would&#xD;
think and say when he heard of this evi-&#xD;
dence of unexampled audacity came&#xD;
across the mind of the unscrupulous il-&#xD;
lian, and for a moment he hesitated.&#xD;

ded you. On the contrary, everything&#xD;
possible will be done to render your situ-&#xD;
ation as agreeable as possible, and you'll&#xD;
be treated with delicacy and with every&#xD;
consideration.'&#xD;
A gasping sort of a sob was the only&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
' Hush!' said Blodget. 'Your fate is&#xD;
in your own hands. I am compelled for&#xD;
my own sake to remove you from the&#xD;
mansion ; but you will be treated with&#xD;
all the respect and all the consideration&#xD;
becoming your sex and rank, unless you&#xD;
by your own conduct, force an opposite&#xD;
condition of things.'&#xD;
Some muffled sounds, that might be&#xD;
considered to mean anything, came from&#xD;
beneath the covering of silk.&#xD;
' Am I to comprehend,' said Blodget,&#xD;
'that your own good sense enables you&#xD;
to see the necessity of submitting to cir-&#xD;
cumstances that are beyond your con-&#xD;
trol entirely ?'&#xD;
A something was said ; or attempted&#xD;
to be said.&#xD;
'Let me assure you,' added he, 'that&#xD;
I am well aware of the love your father&#xD;
has for you, and that he will spare no&#xD;
means to liberate you from me. It would&#xD;
be quite an insult to your understanding&#xD;
to attempt to deceive you for one mo-&#xD;
ment with regard to the object of thus&#xD;
making you a prisoner. It is simply in&#xD;
order to get money from him who loves&#xD;
you beyond all the world beside. Do&#xD;
you hear me ?'&#xD;
'Yes.'&#xD;
The tone in which the yes was spoken&#xD;
was very consolatory' to Blodget, for it&#xD;
let him think that Inez saw the inutility&#xD;
of attempting any resistance to him.&#xD;
'You are reasonable, I feel,' he said,&#xD;
&#xD;
sand I can assure you upon my word,&#xD;
lightly as you may think of that word,&#xD;
that where I am trusted I know how to&#xD;
behave myself with honor. The readi-&#xD;

stances that now surround you will have&#xD;
the greatest effect in inducing me to&#xD;
make this as agreeable to you as possi-&#xD;
sible. Do you comprehend me?$'&#xD;
' Yes.'&#xD;
'Will you, then,' he said, ' quietly&#xD;
come with me to a place of safety away&#xD;
from here?'&#xD;
'I will.'&#xD;
'You will?'&#xD;
' Yes.'&#xD;
Then I have to compliment you upon&#xD;
your conduct in this affair, and I know&#xD;
that by saying that for your sake I will&#xD;
not contrive aught against the life of him&#xD;
who loves you, I shall be bestowing upon&#xD;
you the greatest recompense that's in my&#xD;
power.'.&#xD;
' Yes.'&#xD;
'Then we are equal. Allow me to&#xD;
hope that you will arise and follow me.&#xD;
Here are various articles of clothing&#xD;
about the room. You have the use of&#xD;

you, one by one, will you then put them&#xD;

'Yes.'&#xD;

really felt a kindness for her, and he was&#xD;
determined, therefore, to behave to her&#xD;
with all the delicacy that the transaction&#xD;
could possibly enable him to practice.&#xD;

save her. She, therefore, quietly yielded&#xD;
to circumstances, knowing that her fath-&#xD;
or would cheerfully pay any ransom to&#xD;
rescue her.&#xD;
As soon as Inez was dressed, Blodget&#xD;
led her to the window, and giving a low&#xD;
whistle was quickly joined by his con-&#xD;
federates. By their aid Inez was swiftly&#xD;
and noiselessly conveyed from the house,&#xD;
carried into the adjacent shrubbery,&#xD;
and placed upon a horse, stolen, like&#xD;
those on which the robbers were -now&#xD;
mounted, from a neighboring~ corral.&#xD;
The whole party immediately dashed&#xD;
&#xD;
off at full speed, and never once halted&#xD;
until they arrived at a solitary rancho,&#xD;
some eight or nine miles distant from&#xD;
the home of Inez.&#xD;
Monteagle, meanwhile, had started at&#xD;
full gallop for the Mission, in order to&#xD;
frustrate this villainous plot, but just as&#xD;
he was turning' the sharp angle at the&#xD;
turnpike road, his horse stumbled, and&#xD;
Monteagle was violently thrown over the&#xD;
animal's head. He remained insensible&#xD;
in the road, just where he ' had fallen,&#xD;
until daylight, when he was discovered&#xD;
and hospitably cared for by the inmates&#xD;
of a neighboring cottage.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
A DESPERATE BURGLARY.&#xD;
LEAVING Inez in charge of some of&#xD;
his trustiest confreres, Blodget hastened&#xD;
to the city, to disarm suspicion as well&#xD;
as to attend to an important robbery&#xD;
which he had already planned.&#xD;
A previous arrangement with some of&#xD;
the principal members of the gang had&#xD;
assured Blodget that he should find plen-&#xD;
ty of aid in carrying out his views on&#xD;
that particular evening.        .&#xD;
It was two o'clock as Blodget reached&#xD;
the door of the house that was connected&#xD;
with the gang, and a drizzly rain was be-&#xD;
ginning to fall which he saw and felt&#xD;
with pleasure, for he knew that it would&#xD;
materially aid him in his plans, as it would&#xD;
tend to clear the streets of stragglers, as&#xD;
well as to muffle any sounds that might&#xD;
otherwise betray the presence of himself&#xD;
and his companions.&#xD;
' All is well,' he said. ' This is my old&#xD;
good luck. Who knows but I-may yet&#xD;
do a good stroke of business.'&#xD;
&#xD;
126&#xD;
&#xD;
Blodget was soon in the old house&#xD;
along with some half dozen of the most&#xD;
desperate and knowing thieves in San&#xD;
Francisco.&#xD;
A dim light burned in the place, which&#xD;
was only just sufficient to let them see&#xD;
each other's faces.&#xD;
The falling of the rain upon one of the&#xD;
windows was the only sound that the&#xD;
night brought forth.&#xD;
' All's right,' said one of them. 'Here's&#xD;
Blodget.&#xD;
' Yes,' said another, ' we shall now no&#xD;
doubt have a job to do.'&#xD;
' Yes, my lads,' said Blodget, assuming&#xD;
an air of reckless jocularity, which he&#xD;
often thought proper to put on-'yes,&#xD;
my lads, you will have a little job to do,&#xD;
and it is one that you will like too.'&#xD;
'Bravo !--bravol'&#xD;
' You know me, and that it is not likely&#xD;
I should send you on a profitless expedi-&#xD;
tion; but there are a few little arrange-&#xD;
ments to make before we start.'&#xD;
'Name them.' -&#xD;
'I will. They relate, in the first place,&#xD;
to who is to have the command of these&#xD;
little expeditions?'&#xD;
'Oh, you, of course.'&#xD;
'Is that then thoroughly understood&#xD;
and agreed ?'&#xD;
'Yes, yes.'&#xD;
'Very well, then. The next point is as&#xD;
regards the division of the spoil.'&#xD;
'Yes, that should be well understood.'&#xD;
' It must be well understood or I am off&#xD;
to find some others to help me in the&#xD;
matter. I have thought over my terms,&#xD;
and I do not, I assure you, intend to&#xD;
flinch from them.'&#xD;
'What are they I'&#xD;
'Listen, then. Let all the plunder be&#xD;
fairly divided into two parts, I'will then&#xD;
take one part to myself and my friend,&#xD;
&#xD;
Kay, and you can divide the other among&#xD;
you in equal shares.'&#xD;
The thieves looked rather blank at this&#xD;
proposition, and Blodget seeing that,&#xD;
added -&#xD;
'Well, if you don't like that you have&#xD;
but to say so, and our bargain is at an&#xD;
end ; but if I get all the information, and&#xD;
put up a robbery in the safe and quiet&#xD;
way that I can do it, I think myself en-&#xD;
titled to the share I speak of, and I will&#xD;
have it too.'&#xD;
'Be it so, then,' said the spokesman of&#xD;
the party, 'I agree, and I'n sure I can&#xD;
say the same for my friends here. We&#xD;
all agree to it.'&#xD;
The others seconded the words of their&#xD;
spokesman, so that Blodget found he had&#xD;
made a pretty good bargain with the&#xD;
thieves, and he set to work arranging the&#xD;
robbery with all the tact and all the in-&#xD;
genuity he could bring to bear upon such&#xD;
an enterprise.&#xD;
When such an accomplished hand as&#xD;
Blodget took so much trouble, the re-&#xD;
suilt was all but certain.&#xD;
'Meet me, all of you,' he said, 'in half&#xD;
an hour's time by the corner of Jackson-&#xD;
and Commercial-streets, and I will take&#xD;
you to the place. There will be no diffi-&#xD;
culty at all about it if you take care to&#xD;
comprehend what I wish each of you to&#xD;
do, and take care to do it as promptly as&#xD;
you possibly can.'&#xD;
' Trust us for that,' said one. 'We&#xD;
know we can depend upon you, so you&#xD;
have only to say what you wish and you&#xD;
will soon see it accomplished.'&#xD;
With this understanding, then, Blod-&#xD;
get, left them to proceed to a junk store&#xD;
which he knew was always open, to a&#xD;
particular knock, at any hour of the&#xD;
night.&#xD;
There Blodget bought a complete set&#xD;
of skeleton keys, besides such other little&#xD;

&#xD;
implements used in the art or profession&#xD;
of housebreaking, and concerning which&#xD;
the people of the shop asked him no&#xD;
questions.&#xD;
Thus provided, then, he took his way&#xD;
to the corner fixed on, there to wait the&#xD;
arrival of his confederates.&#xD;
He had not to wait long.&#xD;
In the course of two or three minutes&#xD;
the four men that he had deputed there&#xD;
to wait him were upon the spot.&#xD;
'You are punctual,' said Blodget.&#xD;
'We ought to be.'&#xD;
'How it rains,' said one.&#xD;
'Yes; but that-is all the better for us,&#xD;
you know,' said Blodget.&#xD;
'It is indeed.' '&#xD;
' I say,' said another,' there is a watch-&#xD;
man coming, and holding his hand be-&#xD;
fore his lantern so as to get a good look&#xD;
at us.'&#xD;
'Confound him!'&#xD;
' Step aside,' said Blodget, ' I will con-&#xD;
front him.'&#xD;
A watchman who happened to be&#xD;
wakeful had chanced to see them all&#xD;
meet, at the corner, and had hurried to-&#xD;
wards them, expecting that they were af-&#xD;
ter no good.&#xD;
' Hilloa - hi.loa4' he said.  ' Come&#xD;
now, what do here at this time of night!'&#xD;
' What's that to you I' said Blodget.&#xD;
'What's that to me?'&#xD;
'Yes.'&#xD;
I Why, don't you see who I am?'&#xD;
' Yes, that's seen in a moment; you&#xD;
are a troublesome fool, but I don't know&#xD;
why I should be bothered with you.'&#xD;
' Curse me, then, if I don't lock you&#xD;
up. Come along, will you? Don't re-&#xD;
sist, now. Come along.'&#xD;
Blodget snatched the lantern from the&#xD;
hand of the watchman, and with oneL&#xD;
&#xD;
blow of it on the top of his head not&#xD;
only smashed the lantern but nearly stun-&#xD;
ned its owner, who lay sprawling on the&#xD;
ground, and calling out murder.&#xD;
'Jump on him!1' said Blodget.&#xD;
'Take his lantern' said one of the&#xD;
thieves, ' and his rattle.'&#xD;
' Ah, his rattle,' said Blodget, as he&#xD;
suddenly stood upon the fallen watch-&#xD;
man, and nearly squeezed the life out of&#xD;
him. 'I have it, and now come on. It&#xD;
seems to me as if he could not very well&#xD;
move now.'&#xD;
This was the fact. The brutal assault&#xD;
that had been committed on the un-&#xD;
fortunate watchman had really for a time&#xD;
deprived him of all power of speech or&#xD;
movement, and Blodget and his gang&#xD;
'wont on with perfect ease and compo-&#xD;
sure.&#xD;
'This way,' said Blodget, as he crossed&#xD;
the road to the back of some low stores.&#xD;
'This way.'&#xD;
*Hilloa!' said another watchman, 'did&#xD;
'I hear a row?'&#xD;
' Yes,' said Blodget, as he struck him&#xD;
such a blow in the face with the butt of&#xD;
a revolver he had in hand that he fell&#xD;
like a corpse.&#xD;
' He's quieted,' said Blodget.&#xD;
The four thieves really looked at each&#xD;
other with some alarm, and one of them&#xD;
said-&#xD;
.' You have a *good kind of way of&#xD;
quieting people, Mr. Bloget, I rather&#xD;
think.'&#xD;
'Yes. But don't call me Mr. Blodget ;&#xD;
call me Captain, if you please ; but if&#xD;
you use my name it may reach ears that&#xD;
it is not intended for.'&#xD;
' That's right, Mr. --, Captain I&#xD;
I mean. Are we near the place, though?'&#xD;
'Yes close to it.'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'Ah, what is thatI'&#xD;
The sharp whistle of a watchman broke&#xD;
upon the stillness of the night air.&#xD;
'This way-this way,' said Blodget.&#xD;
'Let us hide for a moment or two.&#xD;
The five got under a doorway, and&#xD;
there they hid and let no less than four&#xD;
watchmen run past them in the direction&#xD;
of the sound of the whistle.&#xD;
No more of the guardians of the night&#xD;
seemed to be coming that way, so that&#xD;
Blodget came forth from the hiding&#xD;
place with his friends and went quietly&#xD;
on.&#xD;
All was dark, the guests had departed,&#xD;
and the street in which the lady resided&#xD;
was restored to its usual equanimity for&#xD;
the night.&#xD;
There was not the least appearance of&#xD;
any light in any of the windows in the&#xD;
front of the house; but Blodget hardly&#xD;
supposed that such a residence would be&#xD;
left entirely without light in any of the&#xD;
rooms, so be fully expected that some of&#xD;
the back windows would no doubt show&#xD;
symptoms of the apartments being in&#xD;
some degree illuminated.&#xD;
' Halt ! This is the house,' he said.&#xD;
'All right, captain.'&#xD;
'Now attend to me all of you, and you&#xD;
will know what you have to do- I will&#xD;
manage to open the door, and then you&#xD;
will remain just within it on the watch.'&#xD;
'Yes, captain.'&#xD;
' You will take charge of the pantry,&#xD;
which I will point out to you, and possess&#xD;
yourself of all the portable plate.'&#xD;
'I'll do it, captain.'&#xD;
'You, then, will ransack the rooms on&#xD;
the first floor.'&#xD;
' A's right.'&#xD;
' And you will follow me.'&#xD;
'I'll do it, captain.  Now we -know&#xD;
&#xD;
what we have all got to do, and can do&#xD;
it well.'&#xD;
'You can if you will ; and remember&#xD;
that we all assemble here in the hall&#xD;
again as soon as possible, and that if the&#xD;
one who is to keep guard at the door&#xD;
sees proper to give an alarm, it shall be.&#xD;
with a whistle such as no doubt in the&#xD;
night time will be distinctly heard by all&#xD;
of you.'&#xD;
'I have a whistle in my pocket,' said&#xD;
the fellow, ' that I'll warrant you will all&#xD;
hear.'&#xD;
' Then that is settled ; so now let us&#xD;
go to work.'&#xD;
Blodget himself commenced the at-&#xD;
tack upon the door, and he did so with&#xD;
amazing tact.&#xD;
With one of the picklocks he had in&#xD;
his possession he easily turned the lock&#xD;
of the door, and then he found that he&#xD;
was impeded by a couple of bolts and a&#xD;
chain.&#xD;
To most persons these would have&#xD;
been rather insurmountable obstructions,&#xD;
but to him they only required a little&#xD;
time and skill and perseverance to over-&#xD;
come them.&#xD;
With a fine and exquisitely tempered&#xD;
saw, which was so thin that he got it be-&#xD;
tween the door and the joist, he managed&#xD;
to saw them both in two in a very short&#xD;
space of time.&#xD;
The door was now only fastened by&#xD;
the chain.&#xD;
' Is it done now ?' asked one of the&#xD;
thieves.&#xD;
'Not yet.'&#xD;
'Soon I'&#xD;
'Yes. Why do you ask?' said Blod-&#xD;
get.&#xD;
' I think-I may be mistaken though&#xD;
-but I think some one looked out at&#xD;

' The devil they did.'&#xD;
' Yes, I think so.'&#xD;
'A man or a woman ?'&#xD;
' It is too dark to say.'&#xD;
'Curses on them, be it whom it may!'&#xD;
' Amen to that, captain.'&#xD;
'But you are quite sure you saw some&#xD;
one, be it man or woman ?'&#xD;
'Yes, I am.'&#xD;
'Then go over two of you to the door,&#xD;
and wait there for a few moments while&#xD;
I work at this chain..&#xD;
'And if any one comes out ?'&#xD;
'Well?'&#xD;
'What shall we do?'&#xD;
'Do you ask me what you shall do&#xD;
while you have the use of your hands?&#xD;
It won't do to make a noise, so I should&#xD;
say that the only thing open to you to&#xD;
do is to throttle any one who should ap-&#xD;
pear.'&#xD;
Throttle '&#xD;
'Yes, and why not ? Pray what busi-&#xD;
n'ess have the people opposite to inter-&#xD;
fere in my affairs, Ishould like to know ?'&#xD;
'Well, certainly-but-but-'&#xD;
Do you hesitate ?'&#xD;
'No-no. Don't be in a passion, cap-&#xD;
tain. If it must be done, why, it is no&#xD;
use saying anything more about it, and&#xD;
it just will be done.'&#xD;
'I should imagine so.'&#xD;
The two men who had been thus or&#xD;
dered over the way by Blodget went up-&#xD;
on their errand ; and although it is true&#xD;
they had at first rather started at the&#xD;
idea of throttling somebody who might&#xD;
be so very interfering and imprudent As&#xD;
to come from the opposite house, it is yet&#xD;
difficult to say whether after all, this ad-&#xD;

ly increased by the off-hand manner in&#xD;
which he proposed to get rid of obstacles&#xD;
to the progress of the particular little&#xD;
enterprise upon ,which he was.  -&#xD;
Curses on it?'1muttered Blodget to&#xD;
himself, 'it seems as if I were fated to&#xD;
he thwarted to-night.'&#xD;
He saw his two companions take up&#xD;
their station on the opposite door-step,&#xD;
and then he set to work upon the street'&#xD;
door chain.&#xD;
It was rather a peculiar process by&#xD;
which he Blodget got rid of the obstacle&#xD;
to his progizs.&#xD;
Having sawed the bolts and opened&#xD;
the locks he could just get the street-&#xD;
door open as far as the slack of the chain&#xD;
would allow it to go, but although that&#xD;
was not above a couple of inches in all,&#xD;
yet it was sufficient for his purpose, as&#xD;
will be very quickly seen.&#xD;
He took from his pocket a very pecu-&#xD;
liar shaped iron instrument, capable of&#xD;
very great extension as regarded length&#xD;
by other pieces fitting into it like the&#xD;
joints of a fishing-rod, only that the sock-&#xD;
ets were squared, so that they fitted quite&#xD;
tight and would not turn.&#xD;
One end of this instrument he fixed&#xD;
in a link of the chain, and then he&#xD;
lengthened it about two feel and fitted&#xD;
a cross piece on the end, so that he had&#xD;
a very good amount of leverage to work&#xD;
with.&#xD;
Blodget gave this instrument about&#xD;
three rapid turns, and then the iron&#xD;
chain broke in two or three places and&#xD;
hang uselessly from the -door in the paa&#xD;
sage of the house-&#xD;
'It is done,' he said, 'Come in.'&#xD;
The two thieves who were still with&#xD;
him now crept into the hall, and at that&#xD;
moment Blodget heard a noise opposite.&#xD;
He who had seen a head project from&#xD;
&#xD;
an opposite window had not been de-&#xD;
ceived. A man at the house opposite&#xD;
had chanced to see the persons on the&#xD;
door-step, and being a very cunning sort&#xD;
of individual, instead of giving a noisy&#xD;
alarm at once, which would have had&#xD;
the effect of scaring the thieves off, he&#xD;
thought he would gently slip out, and&#xD;
run to the nearest policeman and tell&#xD;
what he had seen.&#xD;
With this view he had hurriedly dress-&#xD;
ed himself and slipped down stairs. He&#xD;
opened the door with the utmost caution,&#xD;
and then made a dart into the arms of&#xD;
the men, who were there waiting for him&#xD;
so quietly and patiently.&#xD;
This sudden capture of the man from&#xD;
the opposite house was the noise that&#xD;
Blodget had heard opposite just as he&#xD;
had succeeded in removing the last ob-&#xD;
stacle to getting an entrance to the hall&#xD;
of the house.&#xD;
The attack upon the man was so sud-&#xD;
den, and withal so totally unexpected by&#xD;
that individual, that, for the moment, he&#xD;
was too terrified to cry out.&#xD;
That moment was precious to him, for&#xD;
before he could recover presence of mind&#xD;
sufficient to have the least idea of what&#xD;
best to do, one of the thieves had him&#xD;
by the throat with such a clutch that he&#xD;
began to get black in the face.&#xD;
Blodget ran over from the other side&#xD;
of the way in another moment.&#xD;
'Who is it?' he asked.&#xD;
'Somebody going, no doubt, to give&#xD;
an alarm,' said the man who had hold of&#xD;
him.&#xD;
' Now is that possible V said Blodget.&#xD;
'It is, captain.'&#xD;
'Dear me, what interfering people&#xD;
there are in the world, to be sure. Has&#xD;
he a cravat on .,&#xD;
'Yes, captain.'&#xD;
&#xD;
' That will do.'&#xD;
Blodget took the unfortunate man's&#xD;
cravat from his neck, and in another mo-&#xD;
ment wound it round again so tightly&#xD;
and tied it in a knot behind, that his&#xD;
doing more than just slightly breathe&#xD;
was out of the question.&#xD;
' Now,' he added, 'one slight tap on&#xD;
the head just to make him remember&#xD;
us, and all is well.'&#xD;
The tap on the head that Blodget so&#xD;
facetiously called a slight remembrancer&#xD;
consisted in a severe blow with an iron&#xD;
jemmy, beneath which the victim fell to&#xD;
the ground as if he had been strrok&#xD;
dead.&#xD;
' Push him into his own passage,' sait&#xD;
Blodget, 'and then close his door quietly.&#xD;
It will be quite a pity to disturb the,&#xD;
no doubt, highly respectable family to&#xD;
which he belongs.'&#xD;
This was done, and with so little trou-&#xD;
ble, too, had the whole affair been ac-&#xD;
complished that the man was disposed&#xD;
of, and Blodget was back again to the&#xD;
house before one would have thought it&#xD;
possible to do so much.'&#xD;
' Now, come in all of you,' he said.&#xD;
'Yes, captain.'&#xD;
'You did that well, captain.'&#xD;
' Hush, we will talk about that anoth-&#xD;
er time, when we have plenty of time to&#xD;
do so, for we have none now.'&#xD;
'Yes, captain.'&#xD;
'You know your seperate directions&#xD;
now. Here we are in the house, and our&#xD;
grand object is, of course, to do our&#xD;
work here and then to get out of it as&#xD;
quickly as we can.'&#xD;
'Yes-yes, that's it.'&#xD;
'A lightly'&#xD;
One of the thieves-it was the one&#xD;
whose appointed duty it was to go up&#xD;
stairs with Blodget- lit a loco foco&#xD;

132              MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
match, and then as it burned up they all&#xD;
started, for one of the ,first things they&#xD;
saw was a servant apparently fast asleep,&#xD;
but, in reality, dead drunk in a huge&#xD;
chair.&#xD;
' Confound the rascal,' said Blodget,&#xD;
who now would have supposed he was&#xD;
so near to us ?'&#xD;
'He sleeps.'&#xD;
'Are you sure of that?  Is it a cat's&#xD;
sleep ?'&#xD;
'No, captain, that is a sound sleep.&#xD;
'It looks sound.'&#xD;
He is as drunk as blazes, captain, I&#xD;
"an see. Ah, he has been at the decan-&#xD;
ers and bottles after the guests have&#xD;
gone.'&#xD;
'No doubt about that,' said Blodget,&#xD;
with a smile ; ' and I don't mind saying&#xD;
that it was a part of my calculation&#xD;
in this little affair, that the servants&#xD;
would ~be mostly drunk, and so in too&#xD;
deep a sleep to hear us, or to mind us&#xD;
if they did hear us.'&#xD;
' Ab, captain, you know how to act&#xD;
about it, if any one in the world does.'&#xD;
'What is to be done with this fel-&#xD;
low ?' saia one of them.&#xD;
'Nothing: let him be.. Now furnish&#xD;
yourselves with lighted tapers, and let us&#xD;
set to work.'&#xD;
Each-of the thieves in the course of&#xD;
another moment had a little piece of&#xD;
lighted taper in his hand, and it had the&#xD;
advantage that it could be, by a little&#xD;
pressure of the finger and thumb, stuck&#xD;
on any convenient place in an instant.&#xD;
'Now, quick, all of you,' added Blod-&#xD;
get, ' and you follow me.'&#xD;
He spoke to the one whose appointed&#xD;
duty it was to do so, and then at two&#xD;
steps at a time Blodget ascended a stair-&#xD;
caise.&#xD;
&#xD;
When they got to the first floor land&#xD;
ing, Blodget and the man who was with&#xD;
him both stopped, and sitting down on&#xD;
the stairs, they drew rapidly over their&#xD;
boots, each of them a pair of thick wor-&#xD;
sted- socks, so that their footsteps were&#xD;
really quite inaudible after that.&#xD;
Neither did they leave any signs of&#xD;
footmarks any where, which otherwise,&#xD;
coming out of the wet' street, they might&#xD;
have done; and any attempt to trace&#xD;
them beyond the first floor, after they&#xD;
had put on the socks, would have been&#xD;
very difficult indeed.&#xD;
'This a good dodge,' whispered the&#xD;
thief to Blodget.&#xD;
' Yes, but still be as quiet as you can.&#xD;
'I will.'&#xD;
 'This way. This way.'&#xD;
The thief was of rather a loquacious&#xD;
order of men. -Perhaps, after all, he was&#xD;
a little terrified at the situation in which&#xD;
he found himself, but certainly he could&#xD;
not, or would not, obey Blodget's injunc&#xD;
tions to silence.&#xD;
Blodget would, under any other cir-&#xD;
cumstances, have quarrelled with him&#xD;
for his contumacy, but just then he did&#xD;
not think proper to do so, as he could&#xD;
not tell what emergency might arise in&#xD;
which he might require the best ser-&#xD;
vices of his companion, with good will&#xD;
to render them; so did he answer him,&#xD;
although it was as shortly as he possibly&#xD;
could, to be at the same time at all con-&#xD;
sistent with civility.&#xD;
They made their way up to the second&#xD;
floor of the house, on which the sleeping&#xD;
apartments were situated.&#xD;
On a gilt bracket, fixed about twelve&#xD;
feet high in the wall of the sort of *or-&#xD;
ridor which ran the whole length of the&#xD;
house, Blodget saw a night lamp burn-&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing, and by its aid he was able to distin-&#xD;
guish t he different doors of the sleeping&#xD;
portion of the house.&#xD;
The timan who was with him, and who&#xD;
was nnid Ben, saw Blodget looking&#xD;
about liiii.&#xD;
' Don'tyou know the room ?' he said.&#xD;
Yes-oh, yes; all's right."&#xD;
'Well, t hat's a comfort. Do you know,&#xD;
captain, that it ain't pleasant to be so far&#xD;
off in the street ?'&#xD;
' Vhy so I'&#xD;
'Because, if there should be a row,&#xD;
how are we to get off ?'&#xD;
'Pslhaw! I never contemplate anything&#xD;
of the sort.'&#xD;
Oh, you don't ?'&#xD;
'No ; and if you will but be a little&#xD;
cautious and careful in what you say,&#xD;
we shall do well enough.&#xD;
' Trust ine for that.'&#xD;
'Curse you,' thought Blodget to him-&#xD;
self, ' for a chattering parrot. It is the&#xD;
last time I will take you with me upon&#xD;
an expei iion of this sort.'&#xD;
Blodget carefully now laid hold of the&#xD;
handle of the bed-room door, and gave&#xD;
it a quick, sharp turn at once. He knew&#xD;
that that was the best way to prevent it&#xD;
from making any rattling or squeaking&#xD;
sound.&#xD;
The door remained fast.&#xD;
Blodget turned the handle again to its&#xD;
proper position, and stood quiet for a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
It was quite clear that the bed-room&#xD;
door was fast on the inside in some way,&#xD;
and if it was a night bolt, the difficulty&#xD;
of getting rid of such an obstruction&#xD;
was rather serious.&#xD;
That is to say, it was serious as re-&#xD;
garded time, for he was well prepared&#xD;
with, any means for getting over such an&#xD;
&#xD;
133&#xD;
&#xD;
'obstacle, if he had but the time given&#xD;
him to do it in.&#xD;
'Step this way,' he whispered to the&#xD;
man who was with him.&#xD;
'Yes-yes.'&#xD;
'Blodget led him to the top of the&#xD;
stair ase, and then added-&#xD;
' You will stay here till I come to you&#xD;
again-keep your eyes and your care&#xD;
open. There is a night-bolt to the room&#xD;
door, and I have the job of cutting my&#xD;
way to it. It will take me five minutes.'&#xD;
'Yes-yes.'&#xD;
'Be vigilant and quiet.&#xD;
'I will, Captain.'&#xD;
'And don't stir from this spot.'&#xD;
' Trust me for that. I will sit down&#xD;
on the top stair here.'&#xD;
Not a sound came from whoever slept&#xD;
in that apartment, and Blodget congrat-&#xD;
ulated himself upon having got so far&#xD;
without his giving the smallest possible&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
Passing his arm through the little hole&#xD;
in the door, now, he carefully lifted the&#xD;
night-bolt, and the door was, in a mo-&#xD;
ment, open.&#xD;
'It is done,' thought he.&#xD;
As he now paused for a moment he&#xD;
took a half mask of black crape from his&#xD;
pocket and put it over his face, so that&#xD;
he was effectually disguised and then he&#xD;
stepped back to the stair head where ho&#xD;
had left his assistant, Ben.&#xD;
Ben was still sitting on the topmost&#xD;
stair, and leaning forward to catch aiy&#xD;
sounds that might come from the lower&#xD;
part of the mansion.&#xD;
Blodget placed his hand upon Ben's&#xD;
shoulder, and whispered in his ear the&#xD;
one word-&#xD;
'Now!'&#xD;
Ben started, and turning his head, the&#xD;

&#xD;
drat thing he saw was the black mask,'s&#xD;
and not expecting it he gave such a start&#xD;
9f surprise and terror that he was on hiss&#xD;
feet in a moment.&#xD;
No doubt he thought his infernal&#xD;
majesty had all of a sudden found him&#xD;
out,&#xD;
' Murder !' he said.  ' Oh, Lord ;&#xD;
no !'  '&#xD;
'Silence, idiot !' muttered Blodget, as&#xD;
he placed his hand over Ben's mouth and&#xD;
cautioned him to quietness.&#xD;
The sudden consternation of Ben all&#xD;
evaporated before the sounds of Blodget's&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
' You cursed fool,' said Blodget in his&#xD;
ear, ' what do you mean by uttering an&#xD;
exclamation of that sort ?'&#xD;
'I-I didn't know'&#xD;
'You didn't know ?'&#xD;
'No, captain ; I think I was in a sort,&#xD;
of a brown study, you see, and so I-'&#xD;
'Silence!1'&#xD;
'Yes, captain.'&#xD;
'Who is there!?' said a voice from the&#xD;
room, 'who is there ?'&#xD;
' Hush,' said Blodget as he clutched&#xD;
the arm of Ben, and they both stood like&#xD;
statues.&#xD;
Ben shook in every limb.&#xD;
' Did you speak ?' said the voice&#xD;
again.      -&#xD;
'Be still,' said Blodget. ' Don't move,&#xD;
on your life, Ben.'&#xD;
'I won't. Oh-oh ! It's all---'&#xD;
'What ?'&#xD;
'Up with us.'&#xD;
'No, fool, it is not if you keep yourself&#xD;
quiet.'&#xD;
'I will.&#xD;
Blodget ran back to' the door in a&#xD;
moment, and he drew it close shut.&#xD;
'I'm  sure I heard a voice,' said the&#xD;
&#xD;
same person. ' Kitty--Kitty,- I say.&#xD;
The wench is fast asleep.    Kitty, I&#xD;
say.&#xD;
' Yes, madam,' said a sleepy voice, and&#xD;
a door opened from the lady's room intc&#xD;
another smaller one that adjoined it, and&#xD;
a young girl, in her night dress, appear.&#xD;
ed.&#xD;
' Did you hear anything?'&#xD;
'Yes, ma'm.'&#xD;
'What?'&#xD;
'You call me, ma'm.'&#xD;
'Tut-tut ! I don't mean that; but&#xD;
did you hear anything else before I call-&#xD;
ed you?'&#xD;
'No, ma'm.'&#xD;
'Well, I thought I did.'&#xD;
'You was a dreaming, ma'm, I sup-&#xD;
pose.'&#xD;
'I suppose I was. See if the night-&#xD;
bolt is all right, Kitty, before you go to-&#xD;
bed again.'&#xD;
'Yes, ma'm.'&#xD;
' I feel so nervous to-night ; I don't&#xD;
know why.'&#xD;
Blodget felt there was danger now&#xD;
unless he could adroitly put the night-&#xD;
bolt in its place again. The difficulty&#xD;
to do so without being seen, and in a&#xD;
hurry, too, without making any noise,&#xD;
was very great, but if any man living&#xD;
could do that, that man was Blodget.&#xD;
Kitty, fortunately for him, was half&#xD;
asleep, and she shuffled along the floor&#xD;
in such an odd, devious kind of way,&#xD;
with her eyes scarcely open enough to&#xD;
see at all where she was going, that she&#xD;
gave Blodget every chance.&#xD;
It happened, too, that as she went she&#xD;
completely obstructed the lady's view of&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
Blodget put his hand in the little ori-&#xD;
fice he had cut in the panel, and repho-&#xD;
ed the night-bolt.&#xD;
&#xD;
He was only just in time.&#xD;
' Is it all right ?' said the lady.&#xD;
Oh, yes, ma'm.'&#xD;
'You are sure ?'&#xD;
' Yes, ma'm.'&#xD;
'Then it could not have been any.&#xD;
thing surely; I was dreaming. But it&#xD;
is no matter, you can go to bed again&#xD;
Kitty. Dear me, what are you about&#xD;
now ?'&#xD;
Kitty had, in her half sleepy state, ran&#xD;
against the foot of the bed and shaken it&#xD;
well.&#xD;
'Eh?   Oh, ma'm, I beg your pardon,&#xD;
I think I am a little drowsy, you see,&#xD;
ma'm.'&#xD;
' A little drowsy indeed ! Plague take&#xD;
the girl, she is dead asleep. Go to bed&#xD;
directly.'&#xD;
'Yes, ma'm.'&#xD;
Kitty did manage to steer herself now&#xD;
clear of the various articles of furniture&#xD;
in her mistress's room, and to pass&#xD;
through the door that led to her own,&#xD;
and in another moment she was again&#xD;
fast asleep.&#xD;
'Dear me,' said the lady, ' I do feel ner-&#xD;
vous to night, to be sure, and I don't know&#xD;
why.'&#xD;
Ting-ting--ting! went the little bell&#xD;
of her repeater watch as she pressed the&#xD;
spring of it.&#xD;
' Three o'clock,' she said. ' Well, I'd&#xD;
better try to go to sleep, I suppose, while&#xD;
I can.'&#xD;
She did not utter another word, and&#xD;
in a few moments the most deathlikesi-&#xD;
lence was in the room again.&#xD;
Blodget put his hand in the little cir-&#xD;
cular hole in the door, and drew up the&#xD;
bolt once more.&#xD;
' Curses upon all this delay,' he said to&#xD;
himself, ' we shall have the daylight upon&#xD;
us soon.'&#xD;
&#xD;
This was indeed so, as another hour&#xD;
would without doubt bring the dawn, and&#xD;
then the situation of Blodget and his&#xD;
companions in iniquity would be rather&#xD;
perilous.&#xD;
There were many other circumstances&#xD;
t which rendered it desirable to be quick&#xD;
, about the affair.&#xD;
t In the first place the collision with the&#xD;
watch had no doubt been, by that time,&#xD;
1 communicated, and no doubt the police&#xD;
were active.&#xD;
Then again, as the man in the house&#xD;
over the way had after all only been&#xD;
stunned, there was no saying when he&#xD;
might sufficiently recover to give an al-&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
From all these reasons Blodget felt the&#xD;
necessity of bringing the job to a speedy&#xD;
end, and with such a determination he&#xD;
then crept very quietly into the lady'sbed-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
In the dim light of the bed-chamber,&#xD;
he looked like some evil spirit as he stood&#xD;
casting a broad shadow on the bed and&#xD;
its occupant.&#xD;
For a moment, he considered what to&#xD;
do, and then he stepped up to the bedside&#xD;
and said :-&#xD;
'Give any alarm and you die-be still&#xD;
and you live ! Be quiet-quite quiet,&#xD;
for your life's sake,'&#xD;
The terrified woman opened her eyes&#xD;
and uttered a faint cry.&#xD;
'Yes, ma'm,' said Kitty from the next&#xD;
room.&#xD;
'Curse you!' cried Blodget.&#xD;
He took a revolver from his pocket,&#xD;
and held it to her head, saying in a calm&#xD;
tone:-&#xD;
'If you wish to save your life you will&#xD;
be quiet. It is your jewels, plate, and&#xD;
money I come for, not your life, but if&#xD;
you place it as an obstacle in the way,&#xD;

'Oh, no-no !'                        Blodget saw at once when he pulled&#xD;
'But I say, oh, yes-yes. Now if you open the door that he had received cor-&#xD;
please.                              rect information.  Immediately within&#xD;
Without any further ceremony, Blod- the little square door were some shelves&#xD;
&#xD;
built in the thickness of the wall, and&#xD;
upon them a heap of property of a valu-&#xD;
able and portable nature.&#xD;
Bracelets-rings-necklaces-watch-&#xD;
es-spoons-gold quartz-and jewellery&#xD;
of all descriptions, met the gaze of the&#xD;
robber as he glanced upon the shelves.&#xD;
' All right,' said he.&#xD;
The lady was a bold woman, and she&#xD;
had kept her eye upon Blodget, and&#xD;
when she heard him say ' All's right,'&#xD;
the thought that he had discovered all&#xD;
her most valuable property drove her to&#xD;
an act of defiance.&#xD;
' Thieves l' she said, and she raised a&#xD;
loud scream.&#xD;
'Kill her !' said Blodget.&#xD;
Ben had sprung to his feet, and made&#xD;
for the door of the room, although he&#xD;
had his knife in his hand. The fact is,&#xD;
this fellow wanted the nerve to be a&#xD;
murderer when any oue resisted at all.&#xD;
He might have been an assassin, but he&#xD;
'iad not the courage to engage in a strug-&#xD;
gle.&#xD;
'Kill her, I say !' cried Blodget.&#xD;
'No, no ' said the lady, and springing&#xD;
to her feet, she with a rush made her&#xD;
way into the servant's room; and slamm-&#xD;
ed the door shut in Blodget's face.&#xD;
'Curses on her ! you have let her es-&#xD;
cape.'&#xD;
' I could not help it,' said Ben.&#xD;
' Here, there is no time to be lost now&#xD;
-she will rouse the neighborhood. Take&#xD;
this pillow-case, which I have filled with&#xD;
the swag. We must be content with it.&#xD;
I will see to her and be with you in a&#xD;
moment.'&#xD;
'Yes-yes, I will go-'&#xD;
'No further than the head of the&#xD;
stairs, though.'&#xD;
'No-no.'&#xD;
Blodget made a rush at the door of the&#xD;
&#xD;
137&#xD;
&#xD;
room into which she had retreated ; but&#xD;
it was too strong for him, and by great&#xD;
good fortune there had chanced to be&#xD;
some very effectual mode of fastening it&#xD;
on the inside. Blodget heard a lumber-&#xD;
ing noise in the room, that he could not&#xD;
make out.&#xD;
He called aloud,--' No harm is in-&#xD;
tended you, and I will compromise the&#xD;
matter with you, if you will be quiet.'&#xD;
Something rolled upon the floor, and&#xD;
then hit the door a great knock that&#xD;
shook it.&#xD;
' Confound her,' said Blodget, 'I know&#xD;
what she is doing now. She is piling&#xD;
the furniture against the door, and that&#xD;
was the bedstead. I say!'&#xD;
Blodget heard a window thrown open,&#xD;
and then a vote calling out,-&#xD;
'Help !-help !-thieves I-thieves !--&#xD;
Murder !'&#xD;
Blodget turned from the door. His&#xD;
eyes fell upon the young girl who was&#xD;
tied to the chair, and in a moment he&#xD;
rushed up to her .and untied her head.&#xD;
Then shaking her to and fro, he said-.&#xD;
'Listen to me. Do you hear me?'&#xD;
'Ye-c-es.'&#xD;
'Go to that door and call to your inis-&#xD;
tres that I have gone.'&#xD;
'Ye-e--es.'&#xD;
'At once, or I will cut your throat.'&#xD;
The girl tottered to the door of the&#xD;
inner room, and called out in a loud&#xD;
voice,-&#xD;
'Mistress, they have gone now. They&#xD;
have gone now. Open the door. It is&#xD;
only me, Kitty.'&#xD;
Kitty, in her fright, had done even&#xD;
more than Blodget had asked ler. The&#xD;
dread of death had sharpened the wits of&#xD;
the girl, so that she had seen fully what&#xD;
was wanted of her, and she was willing&#xD;
at that moment to think that self-preser-&#xD;

nation was indeed the very first law of&#xD;
nature, even if it was taken in its most&#xD;
extended signification, and involved the&#xD;
destruction of another.&#xD;
'That is right,' said Blodget, as the&#xD;
girl tapped upon the panel of the door&#xD;
of the inner room, and called to her mis-&#xD;
tress; 'call her again, or you die!'&#xD;
'Mistress!'&#xD;
'Who calls?'&#xD;

' Hurt?' said the lady, ' You don't&#xD;
mean that ?'&#xD;
Blodget heard from the voice that she&#xD;
must be just outside the door, or rather,&#xD;
we may say with more precision, just on&#xD;
the other side of it. Full of revengeful&#xD;
thoughts at the idea that she had endan-&#xD;

The report was very stunning.&#xD;
Kitty fell to the floor from fright&#xD;
with a loud scream.  .&#xD;
' Hush !' said Blodget, as he held up&#xD;
his hands, in an attitude of listening.&#xD;
'Hush !'&#xD;
All was still.&#xD;
A deep groan came from the inner&#xD;
room.&#xD;
'Ha ! ha !' cried Blodget. ' I have hit&#xD;
her !'          I&#xD;
'It was at that 'moment that a shrill&#xD;
whistle sounded through the house, and&#xD;
Blodget at once recognized it as the alarm&#xD;
that he had told the man whose duty it&#xD;
was to stay at the outer door of the&#xD;
house to give in case of danger.&#xD;
'It is all over,' said Blodget, 'and it&#xD;
will be a close touch now as regards es-&#xD;
cape.'&#xD;
He made his way to the door of the&#xD;
room, and was out in the corridor in a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
' Ben? Ben?'&#xD;
' Here.I am, captain. Oh, Lord 1'&#xD;
'What's the matter?'&#xD;
'Nothing-only-only--..&#xD;
' Only what, idiot?'&#xD;
' I thought I heard somebody in trou-&#xD;
ble.'&#xD;
' How so ?'&#xD;
' A pistol shot, captain, from your&#xD;
hands, I take it, is reason enough for&#xD;
that.'&#xD;
' No, it is not. When you hear a pis-&#xD;
tol-shot from me again do not take it in-&#xD;
to your head that somebody is in trou-&#xD;
ble.'&#xD;
'No?'&#xD;
' Certainly not; but you may pretty&#xD;
safely conclude that somebody's troubles&#xD;
are over.'&#xD;
' Oh, Lord !'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Come away at once now-there is&#xD;
no time to lose. Take care of the bun-&#xD;
dle. ' Have you it ?'&#xD;
'All safe.'&#xD;
'Follow me then.'&#xD;
Blodget ran down stairs as quickly as&#xD;
he could, and by the time he got to the&#xD;
hall he found that the whole four of the&#xD;
thieves he had brought with him had as-&#xD;
sembled there, and were looking at each&#xD;
other by their little pieces of lighted ta-&#xD;
per with something like consternation.&#xD;
' What is the matter?' said Blodget.&#xD;
'Oh, captain, it's all up.'&#xD;
'What is all up ?'&#xD;
'All up with us.  There is a force in&#xD;
the street of police. They don't seem to&#xD;
know which house it is, but they are on&#xD;
the look-out about something being amiss&#xD;
at one or other of the houses on this side&#xD;
of the way. .&#xD;
' Humph! What do you mean by a&#xD;
force?'%&#xD;
'About a dozen of them.'&#xD;
'Blodget bit his lips.&#xD;
'Yes, and They are close outside too.'&#xD;
'No?'&#xD;
'Yes they are.'&#xD;
'I will satisfy myself. If it be only the&#xD;
ordinary watch I don't think a couple of&#xD;
dozen of them ought to stop us from pro-&#xD;
ceeding, and I will not permit them doing&#xD;
so either; but if they are some of these&#xD;
cursed Vigilance fellows, it is another af-&#xD;
f'air.'&#xD;
Blodget acted promptly. Nobody cer-&#xD;
tainly could accuse him of want of cour-&#xD;
age or decision. He knew that the only&#xD;
way of discovering who were without&#xD;
was to take a good look himself ; so, to&#xD;
the consternation and surprise of his&#xD;
comrades, he opened the street door and&#xD;
coolly looked out into the street.&#xD;
A sudden rush was made at the door&#xD;
&#xD;
by a couple of men, and Blodget soon&#xD;
saw ten or twelve others not far off.&#xD;
' Hold hard there, hoss,' said one of&#xD;
them. 'Don't shut that door again,&#xD;
my fine fellow, if you please.'&#xD;
' Ah, indeed!' said Blodget, as he&#xD;
closed the door ; but he was not quite&#xD;
quick enough, for a stick that one of the&#xD;
officers had with him had been pushed&#xD;
through the opening, and prevented the&#xD;
door from closing.&#xD;
' Ha, ha ! it won't do,' cried the of-&#xD;
ficer.&#xD;
Blodget laid hold of the stick and&#xD;
called upon the others to do so. By&#xD;
their united force they pulled it out of&#xD;
the officer's hand, half dislocating his&#xD;
wrist as he did so, for he had tied it with&#xD;

The door was closed in another min-&#xD;
ute, but it was only held by the lock,&#xD;
for Blodget had cut the bolts and had&#xD;
broken the chain, so that his situation&#xD;
with his four companions was anything&#xD;
but a very agreeable one.&#xD;
'Oh!' said Ben, 'I do begin to think&#xD;
as we have all dropped in for it at last.'&#xD;
'Not at all,' said Blodget.&#xD;
- Not at all, captain ? Why how the&#xD;
deuce are we to get out of this mess?'&#xD;
' I don't call it a mess. There are&#xD;
two ways out of a house ; one at the&#xD;
street door, and the other at the roof.&#xD;
Follow me.'&#xD;
' What, upstairs again?'&#xD;
'Yes, to be sure. Remember you are&#xD;
under my orders, and you may as well&#xD;
remember why, too.'&#xD;
' Why ?'&#xD;
'Yes, why. Was it not because I&#xD;
knew more than you did, and could so&#xD;
take the command with more advantage&#xD;
to you as well as to myself ? Come on I&#xD;

I will yet see you all safe out of this affair,&#xD;

They accordingly proceeded up stairs,&#xD;
where as Blodget anticipated, they found&#xD;
a scuttle affording an exit to the roof-&#xD;
through. this they escaped, and scamper-&#xD;
ing over the flat roofs of the adjacent&#xD;
houses, got safely off with their blood-&#xD;
bought booty.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
WE must now retrace our steps in or-&#xD;
der 'to introduce a different phase of life&#xD;
in the Golden City.&#xD;
Among the many hundreds of passen-&#xD;
gers who landed one' drizzly day from&#xD;
one-of the Panama steamers, was a young&#xD;
and very handsome female.&#xD;
Her personal attractions had excited&#xD;
the attention and admiration of many of&#xD;
the male 'passengers, who would fain&#xD;
have improved the chance of becoming&#xD;
more intiate with her, had they not&#xD;
been kept aloof by the distant manners&#xD;
of a gentleman, under whose protection&#xD;
she appeared to be, and, perhaps, even&#xD;
more by the young girl's reserved ways&#xD;
and apparently sad expression of counte-&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
- Who this lady was will appear in the&#xD;
course of our tale. Her companion call-&#xD;
ed her Fanny--but whether she was his&#xD;
wife or not, was unknown to the rest of&#xD;
the passengers.&#xD;
About a fortnight after Fanny arrived&#xD;
in San Francisco she rose from her slum-&#xD;
bers, broken by unquiet visions, with pale&#xD;
and gloomy looks, for she had not yet&#xD;
decided upon the course she would adopt&#xD;
fn her present extremity, and her sombre&#xD;
countenance and spiritless manners at-&#xD;
tracted the notice of her landlady.&#xD;
&#xD;
' Mr. Ed wards has gone to Sacramento,&#xD;
I hear,' said she, as she placed the break-&#xD;
fast equipage upon the table.&#xD;
'Yes.' replied Fanny, coldly.&#xD;
'He did not say anything to me about&#xD;
the rent,' observed the woman, in a doubt-&#xD;
ful and hesitating tone. 'He engaged&#xD;
the apartments, you know ; but if you&#xD;
pay the rent when it is due, of course it&#xD;
is all the same.'&#xD;
'You have always received your rent&#xD;
from me, Mrs. Smith,' returned Fanny,&#xD;
somewhat haughtily, 'and as long as I&#xD;
occupy your apartments I shall continue&#xD;
to pay for them. I hope-- you do not&#xD;
doubt my ability to do so ?'&#xD;
'Oh, no,' said her landlady. 'Only as&#xD;
Mr. Edwards engaged the apartments,&#xD;
and has now left without saying anything&#xD;
about the matter, I did not know how&#xD;
matters might be ; but I meant no of-&#xD;
fence, I am sure.'&#xD;
- Mrs. Smith whisked herself out of the&#xD;
room, and Fanny was again alone to con-&#xD;
template the dread realities of her posi-&#xD;
tion. Still undecided, still reluctant ,to&#xD;
adopt either of the alternatives which&#xD;
she had canvassed over, but keenly alive&#xD;
to the necessity of a speedy decision, she&#xD;
yet sought to avert the crisis, if only for,&#xD;
a few days; and having made a bundle&#xD;
of a silk dress and a handsome shawl&#xD;
which Edwards had given her, she left&#xD;
the house to obtain the means of liquid-j&#xD;
eating the week's rent, that would be due&#xD;
on the ensuing day.&#xD;
'Mrs. Edwards,' said a female voice be-&#xD;
hind her, as she stood before the window&#xD;
of a pawnbroker's shop, unable to sum-&#xD;
mon courage toenter; and turning round&#xD;
she beheld a young girl, stylishly dressed,&#xD;
and possessed of considerable pretensions&#xD;
to beauty, whom she instantly recognised&#xD;
as a -fellow-lodger with whom she had&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
once or twice exchanged civilities when&#xD;
they had met upon the stairs or in the&#xD;
passage.&#xD;
'I have renounced that name forever,&#xD;
Miss Jessop,' said she ' and would forget&#xD;
all the associations belonging to it.'&#xD;
'Ah, heard that Mr. Edwards had&#xD;
gone to Sacramento,' observed Miss Jes-&#xD;
sop.&#xD;
'You knew it, then, before I did,' re-&#xD;
turned Fanny, with a slight bitterness of&#xD;
accent.&#xD;
'Indeed !' rejoined Miss Tessop. 'But&#xD;
do not think of going to the pawnbro-&#xD;
ker's, for I am sure that is where you are&#xD;
going.-'&#xD;
'Who told you that I was going to the&#xD;
pawnbroker's,' inquired Fanny, colouring,&#xD;
and speaking in a tone of mingled vexa-&#xD;
tion and surprise.&#xD;
'Nay, do not be angry !' said Miss Jes-&#xD;
sop, whose manner was kind and concil-&#xD;
iating. ' I was sure of it, as soon as I&#xD;
saw you, and you cannot deny it; but do&#xD;
not look vexed because I have penetra-&#xD;
ted your intentions. I see that you&#xD;
want a friend, and it was because I felt&#xD;
convinced that you were going into the&#xD;
shop that I accosted you.'&#xD;
'I do indeed want a friend, Miss Jes-&#xD;
sop,' returned Fanny, sighing, 'I never&#xD;
felt the want of one so much as at this&#xD;
moment.'&#xD;
' Then come home, if you have no&#xD;
where else to go to, and we will have a&#xD;
little chat together,' said Miss Jessop, in&#xD;
a very friendly tone. ' I am older than&#xD;
you in years, and still older in experience,&#xD;
for all that you now see dimly louring&#xD;
upon the horizan, I have long ago passed&#xD;
through.'&#xD;
Fanny was in that frame of mind which&#xD;
prompts the seeker after guidance or&#xD;
consolation to be communicative and to&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
give confidence wherever friendship is&#xD;
proffered, and she walked home with&#xD;
Miss Jessop, whom she invited into her&#xD;
own sitting-room.&#xD;
'You are very comfortable here,' said&#xD;
the young lady, as she glanced round&#xD;
the apartment. 'I hope you do not&#xD;
think of leaving?'&#xD;
'I have thought of many things, but&#xD;
as yet have been able to decide upon noth-&#xD;
ing,' returned Fanny, with a faint smile.&#xD;
'And yet you were about to do the&#xD;
most foolish thing imaginable, if I had&#xD;
not prevented you,' observed Mis Jessop.&#xD;
'For whatever course you decide upon,&#xD;
it would be foolish to make away with&#xD;
your best clothes, and the money you&#xD;
raised by so doing would only serve to&#xD;
avert for a few days the decision that you&#xD;
would have to come to at last. For in-&#xD;
stance, if you decide upon returning home&#xD;
to your friends, where would be the use&#xD;
of delaying your return until you had&#xD;
eat up all your clothes Again if you&#xD;
determined upon receiving the visits of&#xD;
any other gentleman, would it not be&#xD;
foolish to delay accepting of his propo-&#xD;
sals until you were penniless? If you&#xD;
will take the advice of one who has been&#xD;
in the same position, you will do at once,&#xD;
whatever you decide upon doing, for,&#xD;
however desperate your position may be,&#xD;
procrastination will only make it worse.'&#xD;
Fanny felt the force of her new friend's&#xD;
reasoning, and after reflecting upon it&#xD;
for a moment, frankly disclosed her posi-&#xD;
tion, signifying the repugnance which&#xD;
she felt to returning home.&#xD;
' You see that I understand your posi-&#xD;
tion as well as if I had been acquainted&#xD;
with it,' said Miss Jessop, with a smile.&#xD;
If you will go out with me this evening&#xD;
I will introduce you to a banker who is&#xD;
sure to be delighted with you. Ie is&#xD;

&#xD;
very liberal, and I know he admires your&#xD;
dark style of beauty above all othe-s.'&#xD;
Fanny's curiosity and vanity were&#xD;
both excited by this flattering description,&#xD;
and as reflection had confirmed her in&#xD;
her determination not to return home,&#xD;
little persuasion was needed to induce&#xD;
her to assent to her new friend's proposi-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Night found Fanny and Miss Jessop&#xD;
seated in a temple dedicated equally to&#xD;
Venus and to Bacchus. The former was&#xD;
surprised by the scene which met her&#xD;
gaze, and the appearance of the females&#xD;
who promenaded the saloon, or were&#xD;
seated by the side or on the knees of gay&#xD;
gentlemen, enlightened her both as to&#xD;
the character of the place and that of&#xD;
her companions, if indeed there had been&#xD;
in her mind any doub$ as to the latter,&#xD;
previous to her introduction to thatflow-&#xD;
ery scene of vice.&#xD;
'There !-that is the person of whom&#xD;
I spoke to you,' said Miss Jessop, in a&#xD;
whisper, as the banker entered the sa-&#xD;
loon, and as the roue caught the eye of&#xD;
Fanny's companion, and saw by her side.&#xD;
a beautiful young female whom he had&#xD;
never seen before, he advanced towards&#xD;
the table at which they were seated, and&#xD;
sat down opposite to them.&#xD;
'You look blooming to-night,' Miss&#xD;
Jessop, said he, eyeing Fanny as he&#xD;
spoke. 'Champaigne, waiter. Who is&#xD;
your handsome young frieud?'&#xD;
Fanny blushed at the compliment, and&#xD;
her companion answered, with a smile,&#xD;
'A young friend of mine whom I have&#xD;
promised to introduce to you, Mr. Ed-&#xD;
wards.'&#xD;
Fanny and the banker were soon upon&#xD;
the most friendly terms. He invited the&#xD;
ladies to take wine with him. Fanny's&#xD;
reserve vanished by degrees under its in-&#xD;
&#xD;
fluence, and the compliments of the&#xD;
banker appealed to her vanity. She was&#xD;
soon- induced to accompany him to a&#xD;
house in the neighberhood. Fanny had&#xD;
committed herself to the tide of destiny,&#xD;
suffering it to bear her wither it would,&#xD;
and she entered into the house, of the&#xD;
character of which her inexperience al-&#xD;
lowed her to form no conception. But&#xD;
when they were conducted by an attend-&#xD;
aut into a bed-chamber, she was recalled&#xD;
all at once to the nature of her position,&#xD;
and she blushed deeply; her companion,&#xD;
however, found means to remove her&#xD;
scruples, and she left the house, in com-&#xD;
pany with Miss Jessop, richer indeed in&#xD;
purse, but bankrupt in honor.&#xD;
It was near midnight,--some weeks&#xD;
after Fanny's fatal resolution-the gay&#xD;
votaries of pleasure were leaving the&#xD;
Jenny Lind Theatre, some few in equip-&#xD;
ages, but a greater number on foot ; be-&#xD;
yond the immediate neighborhood of the&#xD;
theatre, however, the bustle was little in-&#xD;
creased, for the bar-rooms, the Arcade,&#xD;
the El Dorado, the Lafayette, and the&#xD;
Bella Union, received the human tide&#xD;
almost as fast as its waves ebbed from&#xD;
the -portico of the theatre.&#xD;
One female form alone lingered under&#xD;
the portico !&#xD;
She was a lovely dark-eyed girl, rath-&#xD;
er below the middle height of woman,&#xD;
and wore a silk dress, faded and stained,&#xD;
a mantle of the same material, creased&#xD;
and much worn, and a velvet bonnet&#xD;
modish in form, but worn and faded, and&#xD;
adorned with a black feather in the last&#xD;
stage of decay. Her complexion was&#xD;
dark, and dissipation and late hours had&#xD;
not yet banished the last tinge of rose&#xD;
from her cheeks ; her bright eyes were&#xD;
shaded by long jetty lashes,.and her,&#xD;
black hair was glossy as the pinion of&#xD;
&#xD;
the raven ; her lips seemed formed of&#xD;
coral by the art of the turner, and her&#xD;
form was symmetrical and attractive in&#xD;
the highest degree. A little while be-&#xD;
fore those dark eyes had beamed with&#xD;
simulated passion, and those vermeil lips&#xD;
had been wreathed with the most win-&#xD;
ning and wanton smiles ; but as the last&#xD;
hack drove away from the front of the&#xD;
theatre, the expression of the girl's coun-&#xD;
enance, which seemed to have been&#xD;
stamped there as with a searing iron, by&#xD;
the vivid consciousness of shame and&#xD;
degradation. The change was like the&#xD;
removal of the garland and veil from the&#xD;
skull of the skeleton guest at the ban-&#xD;
quet of the old Egyptians. A light rain&#xD;
was beginning to fall, the pavement was&#xD;
becoming wet and clammy, and the girl&#xD;
looked down with a sigh and a shudder&#xD;
at her thin shoes.&#xD;
Then she stepped upon the pavement,&#xD;
shivered for a moment on the edge and&#xD;
crossed the slippery street, to where the&#xD;
large lamp over the door of a large cafe&#xD;
threw its yellow glare upon the wet&#xD;
sidewalk. A tall, well-shaped man came&#xD;
out of the tavern at the moment she ap-&#xD;
proached the door, and between him and&#xD;
the young girl there passed glances of re-&#xD;
cognition.&#xD;
' Blodget!' she exclaimed, in a low gas-&#xD;
ping tone.&#xD;
'Ahl why it is little Fanny?' said he,&#xD;
in a tone between a recognition and sur-&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
'Yes,' returned the young girl, with a&#xD;
look at once appealing and reproachful,&#xD;
'It is Fanny-your victim.'&#xD;
' Humph,' said Blodget, averting his&#xD;
countenance from the girl's earnest gaze,&#xD;
and biting his lip. 'Have you been look-&#xD;
ing fr me?1' he enquired, after a mo-&#xD;
ment's pause, and still without looking&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the girl's wan countenance, as if he&#xD;
felt that her looks would reproach him,&#xD;
even though she uttered not a word.&#xD;
'No,' returned Fanny. 'I knew not&#xD;
that you were in this city. I am glad,&#xD;
Mr. Blodget, to perceive that you have&#xD;
still so much virtue left, that you cannot&#xD;
look upon the face of the girl you have&#xD;
wronged and deceived, that you shrink&#xD;
from the contemplation of your work o&#xD;
evil.' .&#xD;
' Don't let us quarrel,' said Blodget, in&#xD;
a low voice, and with an evident uneasi-&#xD;
nsss of manner.  'Come in, and we will&#xD;
go up stairs, and have a bottle of wine.'&#xD;
' Never, with you, Blodget l' exclaim-&#xD;
ed Fanny, energetically.&#xD;
'Your baseness has reduced me to a&#xD;
depth of degradation to which I would&#xD;
not at one time have believed possible&#xD;
for me to fall, but never will I sit down&#xD;
in a public room with the author of my&#xD;
rain.&#xD;
'Well, where do you live ?' said Blod-&#xD;
get in a' tone of vexation. 'I cannot&#xD;
stand talking to you in the street-be-&#xD;
sides, it rains.'&#xD;
'Ah, you are ashamed of me?' return-&#xD;
ed Fanny in a tone of bitterness, though&#xD;
her voice trembled and her lips quivered&#xD;
as she spoke. 'Why were you not rath-&#xD;
er ashamed to become the destroyer of&#xD;
my happiness, my innocence, perhaps,&#xD;
my soul?'  *&#xD;
'Pooh, nonsense, Fan,' returned Blod-&#xD;
get, the glow of conscious guilt mantling&#xD;
upon his cheeks, in spite of his assumed&#xD;
nonchalance. 'You are in a melancholy&#xD;
mood to-night, and ifyou mean to stand&#xD;
here talking like that, I shall rush off.&#xD;
It is getting late, and you had better go&#xD;
hone.'&#xD;
'Home!' ejaculated Fanny, with a bit-&#xD;
ter intonation, and hot tears gathered in&#xD;

her dark eyes, and trembled on her&#xD;
black and silken lashes.&#xD;
' Bill l' said Blodget, to a pale, shabby,&#xD;
dissipated-looking young man, who came&#xD;
out of the bar-room at that moment-&#xD;
'bring a back !'&#xD;
In a few- minutes the vehicle rolled up&#xD;
to the spot, and the driver jumped from&#xD;
his seat to open the door. Fanny allow-&#xD;
ed her seducer to hand her into the back&#xD;
but her thoughts were wandering, and&#xD;
she felt a slight degree of surprise when&#xD;
Blodget got in, and seated himself by&#xD;
her side.&#xD;
' Where to, sir,' said the driver, as he&#xD;
closed the door.&#xD;
Blodget looked at Fanny, who men-&#xD;
tioned the name of the street in which&#xD;
she lived, and in a few minutes the hack&#xD;
was dashing over the miry road. Fanny&#xD;
leaned back in silence, and when her&#xD;
companion passed his arm around her&#xD;
waist, she shrank from his touch, and he&#xD;
instantly removed it.&#xD;
'What is the use of your being angry&#xD;
with me, Fanny ?' said he, in a deprecat-&#xD;
ing tone. ,' What has passed can never&#xD;
be recalled, aid had better be forgotten.&#xD;
Let us      '-&#xD;
'Forgotten ?'exclaimed Fanny, raising&#xD;
her dark eyes sadly and reproachfully to&#xD;
his countenance, as he saw by the light&#xD;
of a lamp which the cpach passed at the&#xD;
moment. ' Do you think that I can ever&#xD;
forget what I have been or what I am&#xD;
now?  That I can forget there was a&#xD;
time when I was innocent and happy,&#xD;
and cease to contrast that time with the&#xD;
wretched present ?'&#xD;
'Why are you not happy now?' in--&#xD;
quired the roue.&#xD;
Can you ask me why I am not hap-&#xD;
py now, Blodget?' returned Fanny, in a&#xD;
tdne of deep and touching emphasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
' Ah, do not affect what you do not feelI&#xD;
Do not make me think you so thoroughly&#xD;
heartless as such a question would imply.&#xD;
You know that I am not and cannot be&#xD;
happy.'&#xD;
Blodget was silent, and in a few'mo-&#xD;
ments the hack stopped opposite the&#xD;
house that had for some weeks been the&#xD;
abode of the lost and degraded Fanny.&#xD;
Blodget sprang out, assisted Fanny to&#xD;
alight, and having discharged the hack,&#xD;
followed the young girl up the court and&#xD;
into the house in which she lodged. She&#xD;
ascended the stairs, permitting Blodget&#xD;
to follow her, and when they had entered&#xD;
a small bedroom of the most wretched&#xD;
appearance. She closed the door,.set the&#xD;
light which she had received on entering&#xD;
the house, upon a pine table, and sinking&#xD;
upon a chair by the side of the bed,&#xD;
buried her countenance in the clothes.&#xD;
'How long have you been in such a&#xD;
place as this?' inquired Blodget, as he&#xD;
threw a quick glance round the wretched&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
'I permitted you to come here, that&#xD;
you might form a faint idea of the depth&#xD;
to which you have plunged me,' said Fan-&#xD;
ny, raising her head from the bed.&#xD;
' Reproaches are useless,' returned the&#xD;
man, gloomily: ' I am sorry for what&#xD;
has passed, Fanny, and now let us be&#xD;
friends again.'&#xD;
On what terms?' inquired Fanny.&#xD;
'Oh, never mind the terms !' returned&#xD;
Blodget, sitting on the side of the bed,&#xD;
and taking the young girl's hand. 'Kiss&#xD;
me, Fan., and we will have a bottle of&#xD;
wine up here-no, not here,' he added,&#xD;
again casting his eyes around the miser-&#xD;
able chamber. 'Come away- with me to&#xD;
a house of accommodation.'&#xD;
'And to-morrow ' said Fanny, doubt-&#xD;
fully and inquiringly.&#xD;
&#xD;
'To-morrow we shall be as good friends same bed with you, unless as your wife,'&#xD;
as ever we wete.'                   exclaimed Fanny, with solemn earnest-&#xD;
'Blodget,' said Fanny, in a deep and ness. ' I would rather lay down in some&#xD;
even solemn tone, while she raised her secluded spot, and die of hunger; or seek&#xD;

'You cannot expect it,' returned Blod-  'Not from  you, sir !' she exclaimed&#xD;

ducers of their wives, yet the purer soul clammy pavement, but the deserted sp-&#xD;
&#xD;
pearance of the steets speedily decided&#xD;
her, and she turned into the house and&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
The young man was sitting at one of=&#xD;
the tables over which he was leaning,&#xD;
with his head leaning on his arms, and&#xD;
his countenance concealed: but no one&#xD;
else was in the room. A glass stood on&#xD;
the table. The man did not move when&#xD;
she entered, though she knew he could&#xD;
not be asleep, having only entered the&#xD;
house a moment before.&#xD;
'What a dissagreeable night,' Fanny&#xD;
ventured to observe, in the hope of at-&#xD;
tracting the young man's attention.&#xD;
At the sound of her voice he started&#xD;
from his seat as if he had received a&#xD;
shock from a galvanic battery, and gaz-&#xD;
ed with mingled wildness and earnestness&#xD;
at her. Fanny started also, and stagger-&#xD;
ing backwards, sank upon a bench, and&#xD;
covered her face with her hands, for she&#xD;
had recognised Robert Jervis, her affi-&#xD;
anced lover, in the days of her virtuous&#xD;
happiness. Jervis was pale, and the un-&#xD;
expected meeting with one whom he had&#xD;
once loved so ardently hadkgiven to his&#xD;
countenance an expression of wildness&#xD;
and extreme agitation.&#xD;
' Has Fanny sunk so low as this? and&#xD;
s6 soon, too,' said he, in a low voice, ren-&#xD;
dered hoarse by the agitation of his feel-&#xD;
ings. 'Has she who ran away from&#xD;
her home become in so short a time a&#xD;
.midnight- frequenter of barrooms, and the&#xD;
common associate of the vicious portion&#xD;
of a class, the reputable members of&#xD;
which she once looked down upon with&#xD;
disdain P&#xD;
dSpare me, Robert,' said Fanny, in a&#xD;
faint and broken voice, and without re&#xD;
moving her hands from her countenance&#xD;
'You know not what I have suffered-&#xD;
what I am suffering now.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'I can easily believe that,' returned&#xD;
Robert, surveying her with a look of&#xD;
mournful interest. 'You have made me&#xD;
suffer, too-more deeply than I can find&#xD;
words to express; but I will not reproach&#xD;
you While you have a heart to feel, if&#xD;
vice does not harden it to the core, you&#xD;
will find reproaches there which I cannot&#xD;
spare you.&#xD;
'I do,' exclaimed Fanny, sobs choking&#xD;
her voice, and the pearly tears trickling&#xD;
down her hands. 'You cannot reproach&#xD;
me more severely than my own heart&#xD;
does at this moment. If you knew all&#xD;
that I have endured and am enduring&#xD;
you would pity me.'&#xD;
'Pity you!' said Robert, who had be&#xD;
come perfectly sober the moment he re-&#xD;
cognized the lost girl upon whom he was&#xD;
now gazing. 'I have never ceased to&#xD;
pity you since the moment of my return&#xD;
to reason after that-hour of madness that&#xD;
ruined both myself and you.n&#xD;
'It was all my fault,' sobbed Fanny,&#xD;
weeping as if her heart would break.&#xD;
'It matters little now, whether the&#xD;
fault was wholly yours or partly mine,'&#xD;
said Robert, taking a hasty turn up and&#xD;
down the room. 'It was more the fault&#xD;
of that villain Blodget : may heaven's&#xD;
avenging lightnings scathe and blast him!&#xD;
May his own happiness and peace of&#xD;
mind be wrecked as ours have been!'&#xD;
Fanny sobbed bitterly, and dared not&#xD;
raise her eyes to Robert's agitated coun-&#xD;
tenance. The young man took two or&#xD;
three turns up and down the bar-room,&#xD;
and then he became a little calmer, and&#xD;
pausing near the table at which he had&#xD;
been sitting, threw a furtive glance tow-&#xD;
ards the weeping Fanny.&#xD;
'And you have really fallen so low as&#xD;
your presence here seems to imply?' said&#xD;
he, endeavoring to steady his voice,&#xD;

though it was low and tremulous, and&#xD;
his lips quivered as he spoke.&#xD;
,Imagine the worse, and you will&#xD;

faltering voiee. 'I have wished a hun-&#xD;
dred times that I were at the bottom of&#xD;
the bay, but I cannot do it. I pray for&#xD;
death, that I may be spared further mis-&#xD;

'Heaven have mercy on us all, for we&#xD;
have need ofmercy !' exclaimed Robert,&#xD;
in a tone which betrayed the emotion&#xD;
that he felt, and leaning with his elbows&#xD;
on the-table, he buried his face in his&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
He heard Fanny sobbing, but for some&#xD;
moments neither of them moved or spoke.&#xD;
Then he heard a slight rustling, and he&#xD;
removed his hands from his pale and&#xD;
agitated countenance, and slowly raised&#xD;
his head. Fanny was hurriedly leaving&#xD;
the room; it was her mantle brushing&#xD;
the door as she passed out, which he had&#xD;
heard. He sighed heavily, and then he&#xD;
dropped his head upon his hands again,&#xD;
and sat silent and motionless, until roused&#xD;
by the entrance of the bar-keeper who,&#xD;
thinking ttiat he was asleep, shook him,&#xD;
and bawled that he was going to close&#xD;
the house. Then he arose, quitted the&#xD;
house, ,and walked slowly, and with an&#xD;
expression of misery and despair upon&#xD;
his pale countenance.  The rain had&#xD;
row degenerated into a thick fog, through&#xD;
which the lamps twinkled dimly, and the&#xD;
pavement was covered with thin mire of&#xD;
the color and adhesive quality which dis-&#xD;
tinguishes the mud of San Francisco, ex-&#xD;
cept where the broken condition of the&#xD;
pavement of the footway permitted thej&#xD;

On leaving the bar-room, where she&#xD;
had encountered Robert Jarvis, Fanny&#xD;
had hurried down to the wharf, where&#xD;
she began to walk more slowly, the ter-&#xD;
rible excitement which had until then&#xD;
impelled her onward, beginning to sub-&#xD;
side. But though she walked more&#xD;
slowly, she kept towards the bay, and-&#xD;
still walked slowly onwards. About the&#xD;
hour of one, she advanced towards steps&#xD;
leading down to some water. It was&#xD;
not the first time since she had added&#xD;
herself to the thousands of unfortunate&#xD;
women who seek the wages of sin, that&#xD;
she sought the bay with suicidal pur-&#xD;
poses, but there was something so terri-&#xD;
ble and so awful to her mind in the&#xD;
thought of death, that she had ever&#xD;
dared to attempt the execution of it..&#xD;
'It must be done,' she murmured, as&#xD;
she approached the steps. 'I can endure&#xD;
this dreadful life no longer.'&#xD;
She descended the steps hurriedly, but&#xD;
on the lowest that was uncovered by the&#xD;
water, she paused, and gazed upon the.&#xD;
dark bosom of the flood that rolled with&#xD;
a hoarse dull murmur.&#xD;
'Death! What is it ' murmured the&#xD;
miserable girl, clasping her small white&#xD;
hands, and looking down upon the water&#xD;
that rolled darkly at her feet.  Awful&#xD;
mystery, which I wish, yet fear, to solve!&#xD;
Is it but the intermediate state which&#xD;
mortals pass through to free the soul&#xD;
from the grossness which clogs it during&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
We must now return for a space to&#xD;
Inez and her captors. The unfortunate&#xD;
girl had but a very confused idea of&#xD;
where she was being conveyed. When&#xD;
the party reached the ranch she was&#xD;
taken from her horse, and carried rather&#xD;
than led, into the building.&#xD;
She was taken down a narrow flight&#xD;
of steps into what appeared to her to be&#xD;
a subterranean apartment. And such,&#xD;
in fact it was, for the dwelling to which&#xD;
&#xD;
dreams, and to which no morrow&#xD;
comes ? Is it, as some say, the chry-&#xD;
salis state from which we emerge into&#xD;
new life, like the butterfly? Unfortu-&#xD;
nate analogy !-the repugnance to the&#xD;
soul's annihilation, this longing after&#xD;
immortality ? Oh there must be some-&#xD;
thing beyond the grave, though what I&#xD;
cannot say. It cannot be worse, what-&#xD;
ever it may be than the life I am lead-&#xD;
ing.,&#xD;
She paused in her muttered solilo-&#xD;
quy, thinking she heard soft and cau-&#xD;
tious footsteps behind her, but on cast-&#xD;
ing a look up the steps, she saw no&#xD;
one ; indeed the fog prevented her&#xD;
from seeing more than a couple of&#xD;
yards.&#xD;
' It is nothing,' she muttered. 'Now&#xD;
to end a life of which I have long been'&#xD;
weary! It is but a plunge-a splash-&#xD;
ing of the water-a circling ripple on&#xD;
the surface-and all will be over!'&#xD;
As she murmured these words, the&#xD;
poor girl threw herself into the dark&#xD;
waters, adding to the long list of man's&#xD;
perfidy and inhumanity-' One more&#xD;
unfortunate victim.'&#xD;
&#xD;
she had been taken had formerly been&#xD;
a portion of one of the old mission es-&#xD;
tablishments, which are so numerous&#xD;
n California. The vaults beneath it,&#xD;
had doubtless been excavated as a place&#xD;
of retreat in case of attacks from hostile&#xD;
Indians, or as a depository for the sa-&#xD;
cred vessels of the church.&#xD;
At length they reached the bottom&#xD;
of this subterranean flight of stairs, and&#xD;
then she was borne along a narrow pas-&#xD;
sage of considerable length, the footsteps&#xD;
of her ruffianly abductor raising dismal&#xD;
and prolonged echoes. Her brain be-&#xD;
gan to reel before the appalling idea that&#xD;
she was being carried into the bowels&#xD;
of the earth, perhaps to be immured for&#xD;
life in some dungeon, where the atmos-&#xD;
phere would be close and damp-where&#xD;
moisture would trickle down the green&#xD;
and slimy walls-perhaps, to be depriv-&#xD;
ed of life; or, maybe, and the thought&#xD;
made her shudder convulsively, subject-&#xD;
ed to the brutal lusts of some vfle&#xD;
miscreant whose crimes had made him&#xD;
shrink into gloomy vaults from the&#xD;
light of day and the arm of retributive&#xD;
justice.&#xD;
Her bearer seemed to be fatigued&#xD;
with her weight for he twice set her&#xD;
down and rested a few moment. At&#xD;
length the end of the journey appeared&#xD;
to be reached, and she was now laid&#xD;
down upon some blankets, and the gag&#xD;
removed from her mouth, and the cov-&#xD;
ering from her head, and when she cast&#xD;
a glance of terrified apprehension around&#xD;
the place to which she had been brought&#xD;
she was alone and in profound and im-&#xD;
penetrable darkness.&#xD;
Almost frantically the unfortunate&#xD;
maiden gave vent to her long-suppress-&#xD;
ed emotions in a piercing shriek, and&#xD;
then sank into insensibility.&#xD;

second is, that you become my mistress.'&#xD;
' Then I reject your conditions with&#xD;
scorn and abhorrence' exclaimed Inez&#xD;
turning away.&#xD;
'Reflect well, my charmer,' said the&#xD;
villain.&#xD;
'Cease, sir!' exclaimed Inez. 'Say no&#xD;
more ! I reject your offers with disdain.'&#xD;
' I thought to find you more reason-&#xD;

ever, if you hold out a week, you will be&#xD;
the first who ever did. There are some&#xD;
slices of fowl and ham, and some bread,&#xD;
and a pint of wine, in the basket ; and&#xD;
in the evening I shall visit you again.'&#xD;
As he turned to leave the room, Inez&#xD;
bent her gaze steadily upon the door, in&#xD;
the hope of detecting the means by&#xD;
which it was opened, but it had only&#xD;
the appearance of a portion of the wall,&#xD;
revolving upon hinges, and undiscover-&#xD;
able on the inside when closed, from&#xD;
the uniform appearance which the en-&#xD;
tire wall then presented alike to the eye&#xD;
and the touch. The door again rolled&#xD;
noiselessly on its hinges, it closed with&#xD;
a click, and Inez was alone in the pitch&#xD;
darkness of her prison.&#xD;
Satisfied that there must be som&#xD;
means of acting upon the concealed me&#xD;
chanism connected with the door, sh&#xD;
ran her hands over the inside, and press&#xD;
ed every square inch with her fingers&#xD;
in the hope of touching something whici&#xD;
would set in action the secret spring&#xD;
This manipulation producing no result&#xD;
she next treaded the floor near the doo&#xD;
in the same manner, but still without&#xD;
making any discovery. It then occui&#xD;
  red to her that the spring might be sit&#xD;
uated above 'her reach, and instantly&#xD;
mounting upon the wicker basket whic&#xD;
&#xD;
Blodget had brought her, she felt over&#xD;
the upper part of the door, and the wall&#xD;
around and above it as far as she could&#xD;
reach.&#xD;
An indescribable emotion of joy and&#xD;
hope thrilled through her bosom, as her&#xD;
fingers all at once encountered a small&#xD;
knob or button, about six feet from the&#xD;
floor, which yielded to the pressure, and&#xD;
acting on some concealed mechanism,&#xD;
caused the heavy door to revolve slowly&#xD;
and noiselessly upon its hinges. Step-&#xD;
ping from the basket, she peered into&#xD;
the semi-obscurity of th.lobby upon&#xD;
which the door opened, and discover-&#xD;
ing an ascending flight of stairs, she felt&#xD;
half inclined to venture up them ; but&#xD;
on reflection, she thought such a step&#xD;
would be imprudent, and satisfied with&#xD;
possessing themeans of opening the door&#xD;
at pleasure, she closed it to reflect, at&#xD;
leisure, upon the way in which she&#xD;
should make her discovery available for&#xD;
the purpose of escape.&#xD;
The impression that the door which&#xD;
she had discovered was not the one by&#xD;
I which she had been borne into the&#xD;
chamber by her abductor still lingering&#xD;
in her mind, she resolved to examine&#xD;
the opposite wall in the same manner ;&#xD;
e and, setting-the basket against the wall,&#xD;
- she stood upon it as before, and pass-&#xD;
e ed her hand over the wall in every di-&#xD;
- rection. To her great joy she was not&#xD;
, long in discovering a knob similar to&#xD;
h that which communicated with the so-&#xD;
. cret spring of the other door, and press-&#xD;
t, ing upon it, a door opened like the one&#xD;
r by which Blodget had entered, and the&#xD;
t rush of cold air which fanned her cheek,&#xD;

. She hesitated for a moment, and then&#xD;
she advanced her right foot cautiously,&#xD;
and found that she stood at the head of&#xD;
a flight of steps leading downward., She&#xD;
descended two or three, and then she&#xD;
returned to her chamber and closed the&#xD;
door, resolving to wait until night be-&#xD;
fore venturing into the subterraneans, so&#xD;
fearful was she of having her evasion&#xD;
detected before her escape was complete,&#xD;
and of steps being taken to preclude1&#xD;
the possibility of a second attempt. The&#xD;
cravings of her stomach now began to'&#xD;
demand attention, and feeling that some&#xD;
degree of vigor would be required to&#xD;
enable her to complete her escape, she&#xD;
Bat down, and taking the provisions&#xD;
from the basket, ate a portion of the&#xD;
bread and meat. She hesitated as she&#xD;
afterwards raised the wine to her lips,&#xD;
lest it should be drugged, but reflect-&#xD;
ing that such a step was little likely to&#xD;
be resorted to after the open violence to&#xD;
which she had been subjected on the&#xD;
preceding night, she took a small quan-&#xD;
tity, and then began to reflect upon the&#xD;
course which she should pursue.&#xD;
By deferring her attempt to escape&#xD;
until night, as she had determined, she&#xD;
would be exposed, she now reflected, to&#xD;
a repetition of the outrage of the pre-&#xD;
ceding night ; and would likewise be&#xD;
less capable of ascertaining correctly the&#xD;
.house in which she was a prisoner than&#xD;
she would be should she escape by day-&#xD;
light. She therefore opened the door&#xD;
by pressing upon the knob which com-&#xD;
municated with the secret spring, and&#xD;
cautiously ascended the dark hight of&#xD;
stone stairs. She reached the top in,&#xD;
safety, groped her way along a passage&#xD;
of considerable length, and at the end&#xD;
was involved in as pitchy a darkness as&#xD;
before.&#xD;
&#xD;
At length she knocked her head&#xD;
against a flat stone which appeared to&#xD;
seal up the subterranean staircase, and&#xD;
almost reeled under the concussion ; but&#xD;
recovering from the blow in a few mo-&#xD;
ments, she endeavored to raise the stone&#xD;
by pressing upward with her hands and&#xD;
shoulders. The stone was heavy, but&#xD;
at length she succeeded in raising it on&#xD;
end,- and when thus poised it was&#xD;
easily removed from the aperture, and&#xD;
she emerged into a large gloomy vault&#xD;
or cellar, which was little less dark than&#xD;
the stairs and passage which she had&#xD;
traversed, or the chamber from which&#xD;
she had escaped. The only light came&#xD;
from a rude doorway in one corner,&#xD;
where she could see the bottom of a&#xD;
flight of rough steps, towards which-&#xD;
she hurried ; but at the moment she&#xD;
put her foot upon, the lowermost step&#xD;
she heard rough voices.&#xD;
No sound from the underground&#xD;
chambers in which Inez was imprison-&#xD;
ed could by any possibility reach the&#xD;
outside of the building, even had there&#xD;
been neighbors in the vicinity, but the&#xD;
place was far remote from any other&#xD;
human habitation. She had no means&#xD;
of marking the flight of time, and&#xD;
could not even distinguish between day&#xD;
and night. But her persecutor had&#xD;
told her that he should, visit her again&#xD;
in the evening, and she resolved to be&#xD;
in readliness to fly the moment the first,&#xD;
warning sound of his intrusion struck&#xD;
upon her listening ears. At length&#xD;
when she heard the click of the secret&#xD;
spring, she ascended with precipitation&#xD;
the stone stairs which led, as she&#xD;
thought, to liberty.&#xD;
She had scarcely reached the top,&#xD;
when she heard hurried footsteps be-&#xD;
hind her, and, without casting a look&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
backwards, she fled in terror along the&#xD;
subterranean passage. Her rapid foot-&#xD;
steps were echoed by those of her pur-&#xD;
suer. She had nearly reached the top&#xD;
of the stone stairs leading to the place&#xD;
in which she had found a lamp, and the&#xD;
means of lighting it, when she stumbled&#xD;
over a stone, or some other impediment,&#xD;
and fell prostrate upon the ground, a&#xD;
scream bursting from her lips, and the&#xD;
lamp falling from her hand.&#xD;
By this untoward mischance, the&#xD;
lamp became extinguished, and before&#xD;
she could recover her feet, she heard&#xD;
the footsteps of her pursuer close at&#xD;
hand ; and in another moment she felt&#xD;
herself clasped round the waist, and all&#xD;
her faculties succumbing to the force&#xD;
of terror, she became insensible.&#xD;
It was Blodget who had pursued&#xD;
her, and he was greatly alarmed lest&#xD;
she should escape.&#xD;
As he was bearing her insensible&#xD;
body into the chamber, a new cause of&#xD;
alarm presented itself. One of his ac-&#xD;
complices in guilt rushed in to tell him&#xD;
that a party of horsemen, apparently&#xD;
Californians, had dismounted in a&#xD;
neighboring grove, and that two of&#xD;
their number were reconnoitering the&#xD;
ranch.&#xD;
Blodget paused for a moment to&#xD;
think, and then speedily determined&#xD;
how to act.&#xD;
- The party of which the man spoke&#xD;
was composed of Monteagle, Joaquin,&#xD;
and a few Californians, who, after infi-&#xD;
nite pains, had discovered a clue to the&#xD;
course pursued by the capturers of&#xD;
Inez, and had traced them to the&#xD;
ranch in which she was a prisoner.-.&#xD;
Joaquin and Blodget had approached&#xD;
the house in order to determine the&#xD;
best course to pursue in order to cap-&#xD;
&#xD;
ture the villains and release Inez.&#xD;
' Listen,' said Blodget to his ac-&#xD;
complice. 'If they find me here, I may&#xD;
be recognised and arrested, if not for&#xD;
this, for other trifling affairs, which&#xD;
may end in neck-stretching. They can&#xD;
have no proof of our carrying off the&#xD;
girl, unless the wench is found. That&#xD;
is not possible, as no one can have any&#xD;
suspicion of the underground room.-&#xD;
They will search the house, and finding&#xD;
their search in vain, must leave the&#xD;
place. I will try to get off unobserved&#xD;
through the ravine at the back of the&#xD;
ranch, and catch the first horse I can&#xD;
find and make for the city. Let me&#xD;
hear from you as soon as they go, and.&#xD;
we will concert future measures about&#xD;
the girl. I will be at our old place in&#xD;
Jackson street'&#xD;
As the villain concluded speaking, he&#xD;
he drew and cocked his revolver, and&#xD;
noiselessly moved from the back of the&#xD;
house towards the ravine of which he&#xD;
had spoken.&#xD;
Hardly had the ruffian entered the&#xD;
ravine ere he was descried by Montea-&#xD;
gle, whose party had been placed so as&#xD;
almost to surround the ranch.&#xD;
' Stop I or Ildire,' cried Monteagle.&#xD;
Blodget burst through the thicket,&#xD;
and Monteagle leaped his horse after&#xD;
him, but the fugitive turned sharply&#xD;
round the moment the horse's hoofs&#xD;
touched the turf, and discharged his&#xD;
revolver. The darkness and hurry in&#xD;
which he fired prevented him from tak-&#xD;
ing aim, and Monteagle remained un-&#xD;
scathed, but the bullet crashed through&#xD;
the head of the horse, and the animal&#xD;
reared up, and then fell upon its side&#xD;
and expired.&#xD;
Blodget fled precipitately, ana as&#xD;
soon as Monteagle could extricate him-&#xD;

and knees, and as he paused for a mo-&#xD;
ment in obedience to the instinct of&#xD;
self-preservation, he heard some stones&#xD;
in which the large rock was imbedded,&#xD;
roll down the hill, chinking against the&#xD;
pebbles, and bounding onwards, until&#xD;
arrested in their course by the boughs&#xD;
or roots of dwarf oaks and wild lilachs&#xD;
which grew upon its side. It was clear&#xD;
that the impulsion which his weight had&#xD;
given to the stone, had displaced these&#xD;
small fragments, chipped from itself or&#xD;
the crags which it laid between when&#xD;
it first fell there, and he hesitated in&#xD;
the fear that in quitting the stone he&#xD;
should cause it to'topple over, and be&#xD;
crushed by its falling upon him.&#xD;
In this dilemma he determined to&#xD;
leap from the middle of it, in order to&#xD;
avoid overbalancing it, and, standing&#xD;
upright for a moment, he measured the&#xD;
leap with his eye as well as the dark-&#xD;
ness of the night would permit, and&#xD;
bounded forward like a mountain goat.&#xD;
He cleared the edge of the stone, and&#xD;
alighted in safety below it, on the other&#xD;
side of the hill; but again some frag-&#xD;
ments of rock rolled down, and he&#xD;
sprang aside, lest the whole ponderous&#xD;
mass should slip from its position and&#xD;
hurl him before it down the hill. But&#xD;
the massive rock moved iot, an'd he&#xD;
sped down the hill with the speed of a&#xD;
deer.&#xD;
Monteagle had made slower progress&#xD;
than the robber up the steepest part&#xD;
of the hill, and his companions did not&#xD;
engage in the chase with equal vigor.&#xD;
Hence they allowed Monteagle to keep&#xD;
the lead; and, on coming near the sum-&#xD;
mit of the hill, they diverged from the&#xD;
track which he was following in order&#xD;
to reach the glen on the other side&#xD;
without passing over the large stone&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
which has been described. Monteagle&#xD;
had caught a glimpse of Blodget as the&#xD;
dark figure of the latter was for a mo-&#xD;
ment dimly defined against the lighter&#xD;
darkness of the sky, when he stood&#xD;
upon the stone to leap into the glen,&#xD;
and shouting, ' There he is!' he strain-&#xD;
ed up the steep aclivity direct for the&#xD;
gap in the hill's bare and rocky&#xD;
crest.&#xD;
He was not aware until he reached&#xD;
it of the obstacle presented by the mas-&#xD;
sive stone; but, as Blodget had passed&#xD;
over it, he thought he could do the&#xD;
same; and, clinging to it with both&#xD;
hands, drew himself up, and succeeded&#xD;
in reaching the flat top; but scarcely&#xD;
had he done so when there was a rust-&#xD;
ling fall of stones from beneath, the&#xD;
massive fragment of rock slid from its&#xD;
place, and a shriek of terror burst from&#xD;
the lips of Monteagle as he found him-&#xD;
self falling backwards, and the stone&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
His two friends heard the cry, and&#xD;
for a moment stood silent and motion-&#xD;
less on the steep bill-side, with their&#xD;
hands still holding the boughs and roots&#xD;
which they had grasped to aid their as-&#xD;
cent. They heard the great stone rush&#xD;
with a dull hoarse sound a few yards,&#xD;
and then bound down the bill, crashing&#xD;
through the dwarf oaks and clumps of&#xD;
lilac, snapping the tender trunks of the&#xD;
mountain trees, and grating over the&#xD;
loose pebbles which filled the channels&#xD;
made by the rapid descent of water&#xD;
during heavy rains; but that cry of&#xD;
horror and affright was not repeated,&#xD;
and in a few moments all was still upon&#xD;
the dark and lonely hill.&#xD;
' It is the great stone !' said one with&#xD;
bated breath.&#xD;
'Poor fellow,' ejaculated the other,&#xD;

with a shudder. 'If it has fallen on&#xD;
him, he is crushed!'&#xD;
'Let us look for him,' said the first.&#xD;
'Hush! I thought I heard a groan.'&#xD;
They listened, but heard nothing, save&#xD;
the sighing of the night wind among the&#xD;
trees, and they went towards the spot&#xD;
from which Monteagle had fallen, and fol-&#xD;
lowed the track of the displacedstone,&#xD;
which was marked by broken boughs and&#xD;
torn herbage, down the hill. About fifty&#xD;
yards down they found our hero lying&#xD;
against a bush, which had arrested his&#xD;
further progress. The night was too dark&#xD;
for them to perceive the full extent of&#xD;
the injuries which he had received, but&#xD;
the inertness of the body when lifted&#xD;
from? the ground, gave but faint hope&#xD;
that vitality remained. A rude litter was&#xD;
made of boughs, and the crushed body&#xD;
being placed'upon it, was borne down the&#xD;
hill and across the meadows to a little&#xD;
ranch not far from the place.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
, A rude chorus that was being sung,&#xD;
or rather shouted by several coarse and&#xD;
desperate-looking men, who were seated&#xD;
around a table in a back room of a very&#xD;
low cabaret, and which was never visited&#xD;
only by the most depraved persons who&#xD;
resided in, or resorted to the neighbor-&#xD;
hood. They were thieves, and if any-&#xD;
thing could be judged from their coun-&#xD;
tenances, they were capable of doing the&#xD;
most desperate deeds. The table was&#xD;
covered with glasses containing gin, rum,&#xD;
&#xD;
and brandy, and of which they had all&#xD;
been evidently partaking very freely,&#xD;
and they were smoking as hard as they&#xD;
were able.&#xD;
There was a large wood fire upon the&#xD;
hearth; and the red glare it cast upon&#xD;
their features, gave them almost a super-&#xD;
natural appearance, and altogether the&#xD;
scene was as effective as one of those&#xD;
that are often represented in a melo-&#xD;
drama. Obscene jokes and songs had&#xD;
been freely indulged in, and it did not&#xD;
seem as if they were inclined to leave off&#xD;
for some time. It was night, and the&#xD;
wind blew boisterous without, but the&#xD;
ruffians were making such a riot, that.&#xD;
they heeded it not; and they were evi-&#xD;
dently determined to enjoy themselves to&#xD;
the most unlimited extent.&#xD;
'Drink away, my lads,' said one Mike,&#xD;
raising the glass to his lips as he spoke;&#xD;
-'drink away; we ought to be merry,&#xD;
for Fortune never smiled more brightly&#xD;
upon us than she has done for some&#xD;
time past.'&#xD;
'Ay, you say right, Mike,' observed a&#xD;
tall, dark whiskered man, whom the&#xD;
thieves called Joe; 'but leave us alone&#xD;
for doing business, and for availing them-&#xD;
selves of fortune's favors when they are&#xD;
to be obtained. Cap'n-a toast!'&#xD;
'Ay, a toast; a toast;' responded the&#xD;
others.&#xD;
Mike raised a large glass, filled to the&#xD;
brim in his hand, and said;--&#xD;
' Well, my lads, I will give you a&#xD;
toast, and that shall be, Success to our&#xD;
dare-devil gang !'&#xD;
'Bravo ! bravo !' shouted the theives.&#xD;
' Here's to the dare-devil gang !'&#xD;
'A capital toast,' said Mike-; 'and well&#xD;
responded'to. With your leave, I will&#xD;
propose another.'&#xD;
'Ay, ay, a toast from Mike,' shouted&#xD;
&#xD;
two or three of the thievs, amongst whom&#xD;
he was a particular favorite; 'a toast&#xD;
from Mike.'&#xD;
'Fill your glasses then, my boys,' said&#xD;
Mike; ' bumpers I bumpers!'&#xD;
The thieves needed no second invitation&#xD;
to do as Mike desired, and the glasses&#xD;
were very quickly replenished.&#xD;
'Here's confusion to the Vigilance&#xD;
Committee !' was Mike's toast; and it&#xD;
was followed by loud shouts from every&#xD;
one in the room; the landlord of the&#xD;
house at that moment entering, and&#xD;
joining loudly in acclamation of it.&#xD;
'Ah!' observed Joe,-they have found&#xD;
us rather troublesome customers to deal.&#xD;
wtth, and will again if they should ven-&#xD;
ture to attack us.'&#xD;
'I don't think that there is much fear&#xD;
of that,' returned Mike; 'for we keep&#xD;
too well out of their clutches, and have&#xD;
met with such a career of success, that&#xD;
we may set them at defiance !'&#xD;
'Ay, ay,' answered Mike ; 'and may&#xD;
we be always able to do so ; and all&#xD;
those daring fellows, who will run the&#xD;
risk to live a free life.'&#xD;
'But Jenkins,' asked Mike, 'do you&#xD;
not think that it was a very foolish thing&#xD;
for us to loose so much time in affecting&#xD;
the accomplishment of this plot of Blod-&#xD;
get's ?'&#xD;
' Certainly not,' returned Jenkins;&#xD;
'Blodget has well rewarded us, and it&#xD;
will ultimately pay us much better than&#xD;
a trip to the mines would have done.'&#xD;
' How?' demanded Mike.&#xD;
' Why, Blodget must continue to do&#xD;
the thing that's liberal, or else his game&#xD;
will be up,' replied Jenkins. ' The lady&#xD;
is in our power, and we must continue&#xD;
to keep her so ; if Blodget does not come&#xD;
to our terms, why, Old de Castro, no&#xD;
&#xD;
doubt, will, and, therefore, we are sure&#xD;
of a reward one way or the other.'&#xD;
'Yes, the gallows!' observed one of the&#xD;
thieves, who had been sitting apart from&#xD;
the rest, and smoking his cigar heartily,&#xD;
did not seem to feel any particular inter-&#xD;
est in what was passing.&#xD;
'There's Ben at his croaking again,&#xD;
said Mike; 'he seems to take a delight&#xD;
in--'&#xD;
' Speaking the truth,' added Ben, in a&#xD;
quiet, tone; 'it is very unpleasant to&#xD;
hear it sometimes.'&#xD;
'Pshaw ! don't make yourself a fool,&#xD;
Ben,' exclaimed Jenkins; 'any one would&#xD;
suppose, to hear you talk, that you had&#xD;
become tired of a thief's life. But what&#xD;
think ye of my determination, my lads 4'&#xD;
'It is a famous one,' answered Mike,&#xD;
'and cannot fail to work us good.'&#xD;
'It must add much to our coffers one&#xD;
way or another,' resumed Jenkins; 'and&#xD;
I take no small credit to myself for the&#xD;
thought ; besides, you know that we&#xD;
have the fellow, Blodget, entirely in our&#xD;
power, that murder, which-'&#xD;
'Right, right,' interrupted Mike ; if&#xD;
that were known, it would not be long&#xD;
before Mr. Blodget would swing upon a&#xD;
gallows.'&#xD;
'Indeed it would not,' returned Jen-&#xD;
kins; 'and he knows that, and dreads&#xD;
us. The lady is a beautiful woman, and&#xD;
I almost envy him his prize ; but some-&#xD;
thing may yet happen to place her in&#xD;
my possession instead of...his, and I do&#xD;
not know that I should be over nice&#xD;
about availing myself of such an oppor-&#xD;
tunity.'&#xD;
At this moment, between the pauses&#xD;
of the blast, they heard a loud knocking&#xD;
at the door, and they looked at each&#xD;
other suspiciously, and starting involun-&#xD;

'Who is there ?' demanded the land,&#xD;

'It is only I, Blodget,' was the answer,&#xD;
and being satisfied that it was his voice,&#xD;
the door was cautiously opened, and the&#xD;
villain entered. He greeted them all&#xD;

Jenkins, having taken his seat at the ta-&#xD;

'and don't" you think I managed this&#xD;
business very well for you?'&#xD;
'Aye, Jenkins,' answered Blodget; 'you&#xD;
did everything that I could wish ; but&#xD;
think you she will be safe where she is ?'&#xD;
' Safe!' repeated Jenkins ; 'as safe as&#xD;
when she was buried deep in the bowels&#xD;

who will take care of her.'&#xD;

my schemes would at once be frustrated.&#xD;
If- any one would undertake to commit&#xD;

'I see,' said Jenkins; 'you  would&#xD;

I care not who it is, so that it is a&#xD;
man on whom I can depend.'&#xD;
'And the reward?'&#xD;
'A thousand dollars!'&#xD;

' Ah ! say you so ? when ?'&#xD;

&#xD;
'On your promise of the reward you&#xD;
have mentioned, the deed shall, by some&#xD;

Jenkins; 'but you must wait with pa-&#xD;

to put our plans into execution.'&#xD;
'This assurance gratifies me, and I am&#xD;

'You have had no reason to doubt me&#xD;

'I would not stain my hands with in-&#xD;
nocent blood for twenty times one thou-&#xD;
sand dollars, unless it was by your com-&#xD;
mand,' was the answer.&#xD;
'And Ben, what say you?'&#xD;
'I am a robber, ready to defend myself&#xD;
and my comrades from an attack; but I&#xD;
am not a cold-blooded deliberate mur-&#xD;
derer;' replied Ben.&#xD;
'Damnation !' cried Blodget, fiercely ;&#xD;
and he .arose from his seat and hastily&#xD;
traversed the room.&#xD;
'Be patient,' said Jenkins; ' this mat-&#xD;
ter will be arranged, quicker than you&#xD;
could possibly expect. You see, Blod-&#xD;
get, although they are desperate men,&#xD;
they are not quite such atrocious mon-&#xD;
sters ras they have been thought by&#xD;
many.'&#xD;
'They are cowards if they shrink from&#xD;
the-'&#xD;
Before he could finish the sentence,&#xD;
the thieves were all upon their feet, and&#xD;
by their menacing looks, threatened ven-&#xD;
geance.&#xD;
'Hold ?' cried Blodget, and they all&#xD;
immediately resumed their seats, although&#xD;
it was very evident that the-observations&#xD;
of Blodget had greatly enraged them,&#xD;
and there were many scowling brows,&#xD;
which convinced the villain that he had&#xD;
proceeded almost too far.&#xD;
'Blodget,' continued Jenkins, after a&#xD;
pause ; 'you should be cautious in what&#xD;
you say, my men are not used to hearing&#xD;
such terms applied to them, nor do they&#xD;
merit it. If Jenkins thought he-had a&#xD;
coward amongst his gang, he would hang&#xD;
him up to the first tree he came to.'&#xD;
' I was wrong ; I was wrong ;' hastily&#xD;
apologized Blodget; .'and I hope they&#xD;
will.pardon me.'&#xD;
'That is enough,' observed Jenkins ;&#xD;
&#xD;
then turning again towards his men, he&#xD;
demanded-&#xD;
'And, so you all refuse to do this&#xD;
deed?'&#xD;
'We do;' was the answer from them&#xD;
all; ' we shed not human blood only in&#xD;
our own defence.'&#xD;
'One amongst ye shall do the deed,&#xD;
since I have promised this man, and will&#xD;
not recal my word;' said Jenkins per-&#xD;
emptorily'&#xD;
There was a discontented murmuring&#xD;
arose from among the thieves.&#xD;
' What means this murmuring ?' de-&#xD;
manded Jenkins, and his eyes glanced&#xD;
fiercely upon them ; 'is there one among&#xD;
ye who would dare to disobey my com-&#xD;
mands ?'&#xD;
'I will answer for all my comrades,&#xD;
and say, no,' said Ben ; 'but we would&#xD;
avoid an unnecessary deed of blood, and.&#xD;
especially under the circumstances.'&#xD;
'I have given my word, and it shall be&#xD;
kept;' said Jenkins firmly; 'you must cast&#xD;
lots!'&#xD;
The thieves still looked dissatisfied at&#xD;
this determination, and glanced signifi-&#xD;
cantly at each other, but they did not&#xD;
say a word. They scowled upon Blod-&#xD;
get, who, however, did not take much&#xD;
heed of them, certain as he was, that&#xD;
while the captain of the gang was on his&#xD;
side, he had nothing to fear from any act&#xD;
of violence they might otherwise. con-&#xD;
template towards him.&#xD;
Reluctantly they were about to cast&#xD;
lots, when there was the well-known sig-&#xD;
nal heard at the room door, which being&#xD;
opened, Gordon was admitted.&#xD;
'Ah !' exclaimed Blodget, 'you have&#xD;
just come in time, Gordon; I have a pro-&#xD;
position to make to you.'&#xD;
' Name it,' answered the ruffian.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jenkins repeated the question he had&#xD;
put to the others. Gordon appeared to&#xD;
catch at the idea, and the thieves eagerly&#xD;
awaited his reply, anxious to be released&#xD;
from the perpetration of a. crime, from&#xD;
which they all revolted.&#xD;
Gordon did not make any immediate&#xD;
answer, and he appeared to be meditat.&#xD;
ing upon the proposal.&#xD;
' Do you also hesitate, Gordon?1' in-&#xD;
quired the captain ;--'you were not al-&#xD;
ways so particular.&#xD;
' I do not hesitate, only for one reason ;'&#xD;
returned the miscreant.--&#xD;
'Name it l' said Blodget.&#xD;
'Let Blodget give two thousand dol-&#xD;
lars, and the deed shall be accomplished,'&#xD;
was the villain's answer.&#xD;
'It shall be yours,' ejaculated Blodget.&#xD;
'Enough !' said Gordon, ' I have your&#xD;
word that the money shall be paid, and&#xD;
Jenkins, no doubt, will be answerable that&#xD;
you do not fly from your agreement?$'&#xD;
'I will,' returned the captain.&#xD;
' There is do occasion for it,' observed&#xD;
Blodget, 'if you do not deceive me; I&#xD;
will not deceive you,&#xD;
'You had better not,' said Gordon,&#xD;
with asinister look.&#xD;
'You have good security for my keep-&#xD;
ing my promise,' added Blodget ; 'let&#xD;
the deed be done, and the money shall&#xD;
immediately be yours.'&#xD;
'But if I should .fail?$'&#xD;
'If you do not wilfully fail, then one&#xD;
half the money shall be your reward for&#xD;
your trouble,' said Blodget.&#xD;
'Enough,' replied Gordon, 'then the&#xD;
bargain is sealed ; I will undertake the&#xD;
hazardous deed.'&#xD;
'Thanks, thanks l' said the blood-&#xD;
thirsty Blodget ; 'perform  your task&#xD;
well, and you will have my eternal grat-&#xD;
itude'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Pshaw l' cried the ruffian, with a&#xD;
sardonic grin ; ' of what use is gratitude&#xD;
to me? It is not a marketable commod-&#xD;
ity. But what about the care of Inezl'&#xD;
'Blodget will reside in the house du-&#xD;
ring your absence, and I will leave Joe&#xD;
to assist him in his charge,' replied the&#xD;
captain.           1&#xD;
' That arrangement will do,' said Gor-&#xD;
don, after a pause.&#xD;
'When will you start on your expedi-&#xD;
tion ?' inquired Blodget.&#xD;
' Immediately. There is no necessity&#xD;
for delay,' answered Gordon.&#xD;
"Tis well,' observed Blodget ; 'but&#xD;
you will go disguised ?'&#xD;
'Oh, leave me alone for that,' returned&#xD;
Gordon. ' I have more reasons than one&#xD;
not to wish to be known ; or the first&#xD;
news that you heard of me would, in all&#xD;
probability be, that I was the inmate of&#xD;
a prison. I will so disguise myself that&#xD;
it must be a penetrating eye, indeed&#xD;
which could recognize me.'&#xD;
' To-morrow, then?'&#xD;
'I quit this place, and make my way&#xD;
for the Mission,' rejoined Gordon.&#xD;
'True; and to meet with success, I&#xD;
trust.'&#xD;
' It shall not be my fault, if I do not.'&#xD;
'You will forward us intelligence when&#xD;
you arrive there ; for I shall be all im-&#xD;
patience till I hear from you;' said Blod-&#xD;
get.&#xD;
' I will,' replied Gordon, ' unless I see&#xD;
that there would be any danger in so do-&#xD;
ing.'&#xD;
'Certainly.'&#xD;
' And now that this business is settled,'&#xD;
observed Jenkins, 'let us proceed to en-&#xD;
joy ourselves-come, my lads, replenish&#xD;
your glasses.&#xD;
The thieves obeyed this order with hi-&#xD;
larity, and the villain Blodget being sat-&#xD;

fresh upon my memory as if it had only&#xD;
been just enacted. My heart seems chil-&#xD;
led to ice ; oh, surely the misfortunes&#xD;
that have since attended me have been a&#xD;
curse upon me for not having given such&#xD;
information of the circumstance as might&#xD;
have led to the apprehension of the as-&#xD;
sassins. The unfortunate old man's bones&#xD;
moulder in unhallowed ground, and his&#xD;
blood calls to Heaven for retribution.'&#xD;
She trembled violently, and almost&#xD;
imagined that she heard a melancholy&#xD;
sigh breathed close to her ear. She&#xD;
staggered to a chair and leant upon it for&#xD;
support, fearing to look around her, lest&#xD;
she should encounter the ghastly and&#xD;
blood-stained face of the murdered man.&#xD;
All was profoundly still in the house,&#xD;
and the miscreants who inhabited it&#xD;
seemed to be locked in the arms of sleep.&#xD;
Sleep ! how could wretches whose con-&#xD;
sciences were burthened with such a&#xD;
heavy weight of crime, sleep ?&#xD;
The light in the lamp burnt dim, and&#xD;
imparted a still more gloomy appearance&#xD;
to the chamber ; and tho wind howled&#xD;
dismally without, increasing the horrors&#xD;
of that solemn hour. Inez seated her-&#xD;
self by the side of her bed, and, after a&#xD;
pause, did once more venture to look&#xD;
around the room, but nothing but of an&#xD;
ordinary description met her observation.&#xD;
'What dreadful crimes may they not&#xD;
have perpetrated in this house ! in this&#xD;
very chamber!' She once more reflect-&#xD;
ed, and again her terrors arose to a pitch&#xD;
almost insupportable.&#xD;
The light in her lamp, which had for&#xD;
some time only been faintly glimmering,&#xD;
now suddenly died away, and our hero-&#xD;
ine was left in utter darkness. How she&#xD;
longed for the morning, and that she had&#xD;
&#xD;
some female companion near her in that&#xD;
dismal place, if it was only the repulsive&#xD;
old woman ; some one to whom she&#xD;
could speak ; but silent and dreary was&#xD;
everything around her, it was like being&#xD;
confined in a tomb. She had kept the&#xD;
embers of the fire together as long as&#xD;
she could, but that had also become ex-&#xD;
tinguished, and the room felt cold as it&#xD;
was dismal and cheerless.&#xD;
At length she crept into the bed with&#xD;
her clothes on, and covered her head&#xD;
with the counterpane, filled with a sensa-&#xD;
tion of terror, she found it utterly impos-&#xD;
sible to conquer. She. endeavored to&#xD;
sleep ; but her mind was too much dis-&#xD;
tressed to suffer her to succeed, and she&#xD;
tossed to and fro in a state of agitation,&#xD;
which no one but those who have been&#xD;
placed in a similar situation, can form an&#xD;
adequate idea of. The interview she had&#xD;
had with Blodget, rushed upon her&#xD;
memory, and she recollected every word&#xD;
that he had spoken, and which had&#xD;
given her every reason to apprehend the&#xD;
worse consequences from his determina-&#xD;
tion. Even the sight of that inhuman&#xD;
man inspired her with a feeling of horror&#xD;
no language can do justice to, and she&#xD;
dreaded a meeting with him as much as&#xD;
she would have done the most fearful&#xD;
calamity which could have befallen her.&#xD;
'.But I will be firm,' she reflected ; ' I&#xD;
will muster up all my woman's fortitude,&#xD;
strong in the defence of her honor, to&#xD;
meet him, and oppose his importunities&#xD;
in a manner that shall deter him from&#xD;
proceeding  to violence.  Providence&#xD;
surely will not forsake me in this mo-&#xD;
ment of bitter trial, but will throw its&#xD;
protecting shield over me, and defeat the&#xD;
brutal designs of the libertine and the&#xD;
miscreant ! Yes, I will put my trust in&#xD;
Heaven, and prepare to meet my heavy&#xD;

&#xD;
trials with a firmness and resolution'be-c&#xD;
coming of me''&#xD;
- These thoughts somewhat composed&#xD;
her spirits, and after a short time spent&#xD;
in further rumination, she did at last sink &#xD;
into a disturbed slumber, in which she&#xD;
remained until the sun had risen in the t&#xD;
eastern horizon.&#xD;
She arose, not in the least refreshed, t&#xD;
and had not been up many minutes when&#xD;
she heard the key turning in the lock,&#xD;
and soon afterwards the old woman en-&#xD;
tered with the breakfast.&#xD;
She placed them on the-table, and then&#xD;
fixed upon our heroine a scrutinizing look,&#xD;
and shook her head.&#xD;
' Well,' said she, in her usual disagree-&#xD;
able tones ;-' pale cheeks and red eyes ;&#xD;
no sleep again, I suppose, it puzzles me&#xD;
how you young women can live without,&#xD;
rest? when I was your age, nothing could&#xD;
ever .prevent y sleeping.'&#xD;
'When the mind is oppressed with&#xD;
such unprecedented and heavy sorrows&#xD;
as those that disturb mine,' answered Inez&#xD;
---' if it is not entirely insensible, sleep&#xD;
may be courted in vain.'&#xD;
'Pho !' how very melancholy and dis-&#xD;
mal you do look, to be sure,' answered&#xD;
the old woman; 'any one would imag-&#xD;
ine that you had experienced all the&#xD;
troubles in the world; but stop till you&#xD;
become my age, and then you may have&#xD;
cause to complain.'&#xD;
'Some persons troubles,' returned Inez;&#xD;
'are brought on them by themselves ; by&#xD;
their own vices, and--'&#xD;
'Ah!' interrupted the old woman, snap-&#xD;
pishly ; 'no doubt you think that a very&#xD;
pointed and sarcastic observation, but, as&#xD;
the cap don't happen to fit me, I shall&#xD;
not wear it. Mr. Blodget will pay you&#xD;
a visit presently, and perhaps you may&#xD;
&#xD;
deem it prudent to behave a little more&#xD;
vil to him.'&#xD;
Inez shuddered.&#xD;
'Oh, tell me,' she said; 'is he in the&#xD;
house ?'&#xD;
'Oh, yes, to be sure he is,' answered&#xD;
the old woman; ' for he has taken up&#xD;
his quarters here altogether now, and&#xD;
therefore you will have plenty of his&#xD;
company.'&#xD;
' Living in the same house,' muttered&#xD;
our heroine to herself, and she trembled&#xD;
more violently than before; ' alas ? what&#xD;
will becoma of me ?'&#xD;
' Oh, no doubt he will take plenty of&#xD;
care of you, young lady,' answered the&#xD;
old woman, with a bitter sneer.&#xD;
'He shall find,' said Inez, mustering&#xD;
up sudden firmness, and speaking in a&#xD;
tone that astonished and abashed the old&#xD;
woman, 'he shall find that I have both&#xD;
the spirit and the virtue to resist his im-&#xD;
portunities, and Heaven will aid me to&#xD;
defeat his design.. The guilty wretch ;&#xD;
surely for his many crimes a terrible re-&#xD;
tribution must be now pending o'er his&#xD;
head.'&#xD;
' The spirit you boast of, young lady,&#xD;
said the old woman. 'I hav   no doubt&#xD;
will be very quickly turned, or Mr. Blod-&#xD;
get is not half so accomplished as I take&#xD;
him to be.'&#xD;
Inez darted upon her a look of disgust&#xD;
.and indignation, but she could not make&#xD;
her any reply, and after making two or&#xD;
three observations of a similar descrip-&#xD;
tion, the old woman quitted the room.&#xD;
We need not attempt to describe the&#xD;
feelings of our heroine when the old wo-&#xD;
man had gone: the disgusting observa-&#xD;
tions of the old woman, and the fearful&#xD;
prospects which was before her, filled her&#xD;
bosom with the utmost consternation,&#xD;
&#xD;
164&#xD;
&#xD;
and although she tried very hard to rally&#xD;
her spirits, and prepare to meet Blodget&#xD;
with fortitude, it was some considerable&#xD;
time before she had it in her power to&#xD;
succeed. To know that Blodget was an&#xD;
inmate of the same house with her, was&#xD;
sufficient of itself to excite the greatest&#xD;
agony in her bosom; and when she re-&#xD;
flected that it was not probable that he&#xD;
would longer be able to restrain his wild,&#xD;
unbridled passions, And that any resist-&#xD;
ance on her part, would be completely&#xD;
futile, she became almost distracted.-&#xD;
AIs! she thought, how much more pre-&#xD;
ferable would death have been to the&#xD;
state of agony in which she was thus&#xD;
constantly kept. It was only for the&#xD;
sake of Monteagle anil her fa ther, whom&#xD;
she could not entirely despair of behold-&#xD;
ing again, that she clung to life, and had&#xD;
she not had them to occupy her thoughts,&#xD;
and her heart's warmest affections, she&#xD;
would have met death with fortitude,&#xD;
nay, even pleasure. What had been the&#xD;
last few days of her life, but of misery ?&#xD;
All mankind had seemed arrayed in en-&#xD;
mity against her, and few indeed were&#xD;
the real friends she had found. Her tears&#xD;
flowed fast at these thoughts, and they&#xD;
gave relief to her overcharged bosom.&#xD;
At length she struggled with her emo-&#xD;
tions, and so far regained her composure,&#xD;
that she was enabled to partake of the&#xD;
repast which the old woman brought her,&#xD;
and to prepare to meet Bledget, whom&#xD;
she had no doubt, and indeed the old&#xD;
woman had said he would, visit her in a&#xD;
short time.&#xD;
She had but just risen from her knees&#xD;
having implored the protection of the&#xD;
Holy Virgin, when she heard footsteps&#xD;
ascending the stairs, and directly after-&#xD;
wards, her room door was unlocked, and&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO.                  168&#xD;
&#xD;
the object of her fears and detestation&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
He stood in the doorway for a minute&#xD;
or two,,and it was hard to perceive&#xD;
whether he was awed and abashed by the&#xD;
calm dignity and fitness of her demea-&#xD;
nor, or lost in admiration of her superla-&#xD;
tive beauty-still most exquisite, al-&#xD;
though her once blooming cheeks were&#xD;
pale and wan with heavy care.&#xD;
Inez had mustered up uncommon for-&#xD;
titude, and, as Blodget entered, she fixed&#xD;
upon him a look which was sufficient to&#xD;
penetrate the most insensible breast. It&#xD;
was one of the most cutting reproach,&#xD;
while resentment, and a firm reliance up-&#xD;
on the strength of her own virtue, and&#xD;
the protection of heaven, shown predom-&#xD;
inant in the general expression of her&#xD;
resistance, and approaching her with a&#xD;
look of admiration which could create no&#xD;
other sentiment than one of hatred in&#xD;
her breast, he attempted to take her hand&#xD;
and press her lips, but she hastily with.&#xD;
drew it and, spurning him scornfully&#xD;
away from her, exclaimed-&#xD;
'  egone, sir, your presence is disgust-&#xD;
ing to me. Dare not thus to insult the&#xD;
victim of your guilt.&#xD;
'Who's the master, now, fair Inez 1&#xD;
demanded the villain, and a look of ex-&#xD;
ultation overspread his features ; ' who&#xD;
triumphs nowI'&#xD;
'Oh, villain-heartless villain 1' cried&#xD;
Inez, her bosom swelling with agony,&#xD;
' can you stand there and talk to me&#xD;
thus ? Are you not afraid that the ven-&#xD;
geance of the Almighty will immediately&#xD;
descend upon your head, and render you&#xD;
powerless to do further harm?'&#xD;
'I scorn it.'&#xD;
Inez shuddered with horror at the&#xD;
words of the wretch ; who, however,&#xD;

&#xD;
presently altered his tone, and once more&#xD;
endeavoring to take her hand, which she&#xD;
successfully resisted, he assumed an in-&#xD;
sinuating smile, and in a voice 2f gentle&#xD;
persuasion, said-&#xD;
'Pray pardon me, beauteous Inez, if I&#xD;
have been led into- the expression of&#xD;
words that have caused anguish to your&#xD;
feelings ; but the injuries I have received&#xD;
from Monteagle-.'&#xD;
"Tis false !' scornfully replied our he-&#xD;
roine, and her brilliant eyes appeared to&#xD;
fash fire; 'Monteagle never injured you,&#xD;
but you was ever the serpent in his&#xD;
bosom, waiting an opportunity to destroy&#xD;
his peace, and you have yourself ac-&#xD;
knowledged the same, and expressed&#xD;
your inhuman exultation at the misery&#xD;
which you have caused, him.'&#xD;
Well,' returned Blodget, with the ut-&#xD;
most coolness, and the boldness of his&#xD;
manner increasing, 'I will not deny it,&#xD;
because there is no necessity for my so&#xD;
doing,.as the power is now mine. I have&#xD;
already had a terrible revenge, but still&#xD;
it is not complete, and never will I rest&#xD;
until it is wholly accomplished.'-&#xD;
"Oh, Blodget l' ejaculated Inez, her&#xD;
fortitude failing her when+ she saw the&#xD;
villain's recklessness and determination,&#xD;
and reflected:that she-was entirely in his&#xD;
power, and left solely to his mercy, or the&#xD;
interposition of Providence, 'will noth-&#xD;
ing induce you to relent in your cruelty?'&#xD;
'Nothing,' answered Blodget, ' until I&#xD;
have gained the full gratification of my,&#xD;
wishes, and the consummation of all my&#xD;
hopes. Then only shall I be satisfied.'&#xD;
'-What mean you?'&#xD;
'You will behold Monteagle no more.'&#xD;
'Oh, God 1' ejaculated Inez, and her&#xD;
heart throbbed heavily against her side,&#xD;
her cheeks turned ashy, pale, and - her&#xD;
limbs trembled violently as a dread of&#xD;
&#xD;
something terrible about to take place,&#xD;
through the guilty machinations of the&#xD;
wretch who stood before her, darted&#xD;
upon her brain; 'cruel as you are, surely&#xD;
you would not seek his life?'&#xD;
A grim and sardonic smile passed over&#xD;
the features of Blodget as she gave ut-&#xD;
terance to these words, but he returned&#xD;
no answer ; his looks spoke more than&#xD;
words, and had a thunderbolt at that mo-&#xD;
ment descended upon her head, Ines&#xD;
could not have felt more paralyzed and&#xD;
awe-struck than she did at that time.&#xD;
With distended eye-lids, she fixed upon&#xD;
him a look which was sufficient to have&#xD;
penetrated even the most obdurate heart,&#xD;
and to carry awe to the guilty soul; her&#xD;
features became stern and fixed ; her&#xD;
lips parted but she uttered no sound, and,&#xD;
suddenly approaching the astonished&#xD;
Blodget,she grasped his arm vehemently,&#xD;
and looked full upon him. Blodget could&#xD;
not help, in spite of all his hardihood,&#xD;
shuddering beneath her gaze, and the&#xD;
singlarity of her behavior, but he was&#xD;
not a minute before he completely reco-&#xD;
vered himself, and looking coolly and&#xD;

still 'fixed with the same earnestness of&#xD;

wrapped up in the answer which Blodget in time, she would be entirely conquered,&#xD;
would return to her; and she appeared and made to yield subserviently to his&#xD;
as if she would drag the secret from his will. However, he endeavored to dis-&#xD;

trouble I have taken, the risks I have&#xD;

get 'you in my power, that I will now&#xD;
quietly resign you?  Think you that I&#xD;
would place myself at the mercy of my&#xD;
enemies?  No, no ! you must give up&#xD;
all idea of such a thing, and, henceforth,&#xD;
look upon me in the same light as your&#xD;

wishes,-and that speedily ; I would have&#xD;
you do so of your own free will; but if,&#xD;
after a given time you still remain fool-&#xD;
-ishly obstinate, then must I, however&#xD;
much it may be against my wishes, use&#xD;
force. Resistance, you perceive, will be&#xD;
in vain, and therefore, I advise you to&#xD;
make up your mind to assent without it;&#xD;
then shall you receive every attention&#xD;
from me, and I will behave in a manner&#xD;
that shall leave you no cause to regret&#xD;
your separation from your father.'&#xD;
'Fiend in human shape,' ejaculated&#xD;
Inez,'leave me ! My soul freezes with&#xD;
horror as I listen to you! But I will&#xD;
not entirely despair, although you have&#xD;
bid me to dlo so; Heaven will interpose&#xD;
to prevent the execution of your base&#xD;
threats.',&#xD;
'Did Heaven interpose to prevent my&#xD;
getting you in my power?' inquired&#xD;
Blodget, with a sardonic grin. ' Once&#xD;
more I tell you, you shall be mine, and&#xD;
nothing shall save you!'&#xD;
'Never, villain !' cried Inez.&#xD;
'Be cautions what you say, lady, lest&#xD;
you exasperate me,' returned Blodget,&#xD;
with a threatening frown, which made&#xD;
our heroine tremble ; 'you forget that I&#xD;
could, this day-this very moment--&#xD;
force you to a compliance with my wishes,&#xD;
and where is there one near at hand who&#xD;
could come to save you ?'&#xD;
'By Heavens I would die first !'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Bah !' sneered Blodget; 'btst I am&#xD;
tired of this useless contest of words;&#xD;
you know my determination, and rest as-&#xD;
sured that I will only await a very few&#xD;
days for your answer, and then, if you&#xD;
do not consent, you-"know the conse-&#xD;
quences.'&#xD;
'Once more I pray your mercy,' said&#xD;
the distracted Inez, with clasped hands,&#xD;
and looks of earnest supplication ; be-&#xD;
ware ! oh, beware ! ere you proceed to&#xD;
extremities.'&#xD;
'You have it in your power to move&#xD;
me to pity and love, fair Inez,' returned&#xD;
Blodget ; 'one smile from you, one word&#xD;
of affection from those ruby lips would&#xD;
act with the influence of magic upon&#xD;
me and make me quite a different man,&#xD;
Blodget would then live alone for love&#xD;
and you ; and there should not be a&#xD;
pleasure which it should not be my con-&#xD;
stant endeavor to procure you.'&#xD;
Inez turned from the villain with a&#xD;
look of the utmost disgust, and she&#xD;
groaned aloud in the intensity of her&#xD;
anguished feelings. Blodget advanced&#xD;
nearer to her, and. sought to put his&#xD;
arms around her waist, but the action&#xD;
immediately aroused her, and retreating&#xD;
to the further end of the room, she fixed&#xD;
upon him such a look as awed him into&#xD;
immediate forbearance.&#xD;
'Still madly obstinate!' he exclaimed;&#xD;
' but time must alter this proud beauty,&#xD;
and you must yield to the desires of&#xD;
Blodget, however repugnant it may be&#xD;
to your feelings. At present I leave you,&#xD;
but shortly you will behold me again,&#xD;
and then I trust that you will see the&#xD;
polity of giving me a more favorable re-&#xD;
ception than you have done this morn-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
As he spoke, Blodget fixed one glance&#xD;
of expressive meaning, and then quitting&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
the room, he securely fastened the door&#xD;
after him.&#xD;
'The perverse woman,' he soliloquis-&#xD;
ed, as he walked away ; but she must&#xD;
be subdued ;-she must be subdued;&#xD;
Blodget cannot much longer endure her&#xD;
resistance. Oh, did she but know the&#xD;
plot I have formed against the life of&#xD;
Monteagle-but I said quite enough to&#xD;
arouse her fears, although I now wish&#xD;
that I had not done so, as it would be&#xD;
sure not to promote my wishes. I wish&#xD;
not to have to use violence, or I could&#xD;
do so directly ; no, my greater triumph&#xD;
would be to prevail upon her to give&#xD;
her own free consent, and that would&#xD;
add to the gratification of my revenge.-&#xD;
Blodget, if you fail in this, it will be the&#xD;
first time that you have failed in any of&#xD;
your undertakings.'&#xD;
The villain walked  ay, and after&#xD;
giving strict injunctions o Joe to keep&#xD;
safe watch over his charge, he bent his&#xD;
footsteps towards the cabaret, at which&#xD;
he and the thieves had been the night&#xD;
before carousing, and where, in a back&#xD;
room, he could commune with his own&#xD;
thoughts,withou tany fear of interruption.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
The Critical Move--Attempted Escape.&#xD;
WHEN Blodget had retired from the&#xD;
room, our heroine gave vent to the pain-&#xD;
ful feelings which her interview with him&#xD;
had excited in her bosom; and hope&#xD;
seemed to have faded entirely away from&#xD;
her mind; for if the villain remained ob-&#xD;
atinately resolved to put his diabolical&#xD;
threats into execution, what means had&#xD;
she of resisting himI  None !  Then&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FR4NCISCO.                16W&#xD;
&#xD;
again the hints he had given convinced&#xD;
her that he had some base design in his&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
She was aroused from these reflections&#xD;
by the entrance of the old woman who&#xD;
had come to do something in her&#xD;
apartment, and whose disagreeable looks&#xD;
assured our heroine that she took a plea-&#xD;
sure ifi tormenting her, and saying any-&#xD;
thing which she thought might excite&#xD;
her feelings, ald Inez, therefore, deter-&#xD;
mined to avoid conversing with her, as&#xD;
much as she possibly could. The old&#xD;
woman, however, appeared to be deter-&#xD;
mined that she should not escape so&#xD;
easily ; for the words she had so pointed-&#xD;
ly directed to her in the morning, re-&#xD;
mained in her memory ; and after having&#xD;
eyed her with an insolent glance for a&#xD;
second or two, she ejaculated, in her&#xD;
usual harsh but querulous tones:&#xD;
'I hope your ladyship feels happier af-&#xD;
ter the interview you have had with your&#xD;
lover, and that the observations he has&#xD;
addressed to you, have met your appro-&#xD;
bation, Oh, he is a very nice gentleman)&#xD;
He! he! he!'&#xD;
And the disgusting old woman croak-&#xD;
ed forth a laugh, which could scarcely&#xD;
have been imagined to have been utter-&#xD;
ed by anything but a witch ; and appear-&#xD;
ed to think that she had spoken very&#xD;
wittily and sarcastically. But Inez did&#xD;
not deign to condescend her any answer,&#xD;
and she averted her eyes, for there was&#xD;
something so remarkably disagreeable in&#xD;
the woman's face, that she could not&#xD;
bear to look upon it.&#xD;
The old woman saw plain enough that&#xD;
her observations annoyed Inez, and al-&#xD;
though she felt rather vexed and disap-&#xD;
pointed that she did not answer her, she&#xD;
determined to follow them up.&#xD;

'Oh, my dear friend !' she added, as  'Leave the room,' said Inez, in a tone&#xD;
she - recalled to her memory the dark of resentment, ' and let me alone to my&#xD;
hints which Blodget had given utterance reflections; your language is brutal, and&#xD;
to, and covering her face with her hands, I will not listen to it.'&#xD;
she sobbed hysterically. ' Oh, my un-  'But I am afraid you will have to lis-&#xD;

&#xD;
be. As for leaving the room, you will&#xD;
please to recollect that you are not mis-&#xD;
tress here, consequently I shall not attend&#xD;
to your orders until it pleases me.'&#xD;
Inez walked away, and throwing her-&#xD;
self into a chair, once more covered her&#xD;
face with her hands, determined not to&#xD;
pay any future attention to what the old&#xD;
harridan might say. The latter laughed&#xD;
sneeringly, and after muttering a few&#xD;
spiteful remarks that our heroine (lid&#xD;
not hear, she applied herself more assidu-&#xD;
ously to the task she had to perform in&#xD;
&#xD;
nay, perhaps he was no more, and she&#xD;
was not present to receive his last sigh&#xD;
or to enfold him in a dying embrace.--&#xD;
The thought was almost past endurance;&#xD;
and it was a fortunate thing for our he-&#xD;
roine that a torrent of tears came to the&#xD;
relief of her overcharged heart.&#xD;
Three weeks elapsed without any ma-&#xD;
terial change taking place in the situa-&#xD;
tion or-prospects of Ines. Blodget visit-&#xD;
ed her every day, and she was annoyed&#xD;
by his disgusting importunities; and fre-&#xD;
quently was he so worked up by the op-&#xD;
position which she offered to him, that&#xD;
he was half tempted to proceed to vio-&#xD;
lence; but a secret power appeared to&#xD;
restrain him, and to watch over his un-&#xD;
fortunate victim.&#xD;
Blodget was in a state of considerable&#xD;
anxiety and suspense, for he had not yet&#xD;
heard anything from Gordon, and some-&#xD;
times he was fearful that he had been&#xD;
detected and was in custody ; but again&#xD;
he thought, if he had been so, he should&#xD;
see some account of it in the newspapers,&#xD;
and he, therefore, at last endeavored to&#xD;
conclude that Gordon thought it prudent&#xD;
not to write to him, and that he was in&#xD;
a fair way of being ultimately successful&#xD;
in his blood-thirsty designs.&#xD;
The thieves had made several success-&#xD;
ful hauls, since the departure of Gordon,&#xD;
and they were not less anxious than Blod-&#xD;
get was to know what had become of&#xD;
him, and whether he was safe, for Gordon&#xD;
was acquainted with many circumstances&#xD;
that might greatly endanger them, should&#xD;
he be tempted to divulge them. Such&#xD;
is the doubt and suspicions that ever ex-&#xD;
ist between the guilty.&#xD;
At length, however, after another forte&#xD;
night, a message arrived at the ranch of&#xD;
Gordon, which came from him, and it&#xD;

the room, and at the same time hummed,&#xD;
in discordant tones, snatches from differ-&#xD;
ent vulgar songs, which fell listlessly&#xD;
upon the ears of Inez, who was too deep-&#xD;
ly engaged by her own melancholy&#xD;
thoughts to pay any attention to them.&#xD;
At length having, much to the satis-&#xD;
faction of our heroine, _completed her&#xD;
domestic duties in the room, the woman&#xD;
fixed upon Inez a spiteful look, and then&#xD;
retired from the apartment. When she&#xD;
had gone, our heroine immediately sunk&#xD;
upon her knees, and, with upraised hands,&#xD;
she implored the mercy of the Supreme&#xD;
Being, and that He would protect her&#xD;
father and her lover from anydanger by&#xD;
which they might be threatened. She&#xD;
arose m ore composed and confident, and&#xD;
endeavored to hope that, after all, the&#xD;
wicked designs of Blodget might be foil-&#xD;
ed, and that something would yet trans-&#xD;
pire to release her from her present in-&#xD;
carceration, and the future persecution of&#xD;
the villain Blodget, for whom no punish-&#xD;
ment could be adequate to the different&#xD;
crimes he fad been guilty of.&#xD;
Frequently did her thoughts revert to&#xD;
home, and she could well imagine the&#xD;
grief experienced at her mysterious dis-&#xD;
appearance. The idea of the deplorable&#xD;
condition of Monteagle was maddening&#xD;

&#xD;
baste Blodget broke the seal, and glanced&#xD;
his eyes over the contents. They afforded&#xD;
him the most unbounded satisfaction.&#xD;
'Ah ! by the infernal host ! this is cap-&#xD;
ital,' exclaimed Blodget, when he had&#xD;
concluded perusing the letter; 'my ven-&#xD;
geance will soon be complete ; and I have&#xD;
no doubt that Gordon will shortly be&#xD;
able to discover Monteagle, and to ac-&#xD;
complish the deed for which my soul'&#xD;
pants.'&#xD;
He immediately sought out Jenkins,&#xD;
who was at his usual place of resort when&#xD;
be-was not on his expeditions, and show-&#xD;
ed him the letter. from  Gordon. The&#xD;
robber captain perused it. with satisfac-&#xD;
tion, and his apprehensions were now at&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
'What think you of the suggestion&#xD;
which Gordon has made ?' asked Blod-&#xD;
get, when Jenkins had finished reading&#xD;
the letter.&#xD;
'Why, that it is a very excellent one,'&#xD;
answered the captain.&#xD;
'True,' coincided Blodget.&#xD;
'You will avail yourself of it, then ?'&#xD;
'Why,,think you not I should be fool-&#xD;
ish to miss such an opportunity ?'&#xD;
'I do.'&#xD;
'Gordon deserves an extra reward for&#xD;
this.'&#xD;
He is a shrewd fellow.'&#xD;
'And one who does not stand particu-&#xD;
lar about trifles.'&#xD;
'No, crime and he are familiar. But&#xD;
how would you accomplish-this design ?'&#xD;
I have-not as yet had time to consid-&#xD;
or it properly,' answered Blodget; 'can&#xD;
you give me any advice, captain?'&#xD;
'Gordon I do not think can do it with-&#xD;
out assistance.'&#xD;
.'Probably not.'&#xD;
'If I and a crew run the risk of going&#xD;
in a lgoat to Mission Creek, and bring the&#xD;
&#xD;
fellow away, of course you will reward&#xD;
us ?'&#xD;
'Certainly ; but that course will be at-&#xD;
tended with much danger, for should the&#xD;
real character of your boat be known -'&#xD;
'Oh, I can manage it so that there&#xD;
will be no danger of a discovery taking&#xD;
place,' replied Jenkins.&#xD;
'Ah, then, be it so, and we will not&#xD;
fall out about the reward.'&#xD;
'Agreed,' answered the captain, 'an&#xD;
answer must, therefore, be despatched to&#xD;
the place where Gordon is staying, ac-&#xD;
quainting him  with our intentions, so&#xD;
that he may make the necessary prepar-&#xD;
ations for carrying our designs into exe-&#xD;
cution.'&#xD;
'It shall be done immediately. But&#xD;
think you that success is at all likely ?'&#xD;
'It is all but certain.'&#xD;
'And had Monteagle better be brought&#xD;
to the house where Inez is confined ?'&#xD;
'That you can use your own pleasure&#xD;
in,' replied Jenkins.&#xD;
Blodget reflected for a few moments.&#xD;
'No,' he at last said, 'it shall not be&#xD;
so at present ; I think it would be as well&#xD;
not to let Inez know anything about it&#xD;
for 'L shortatime.,&#xD;
'Why so?'&#xD;
'Why,' returned Blodget, 'in the first&#xD;
place, the sudden shock might be attend-&#xD;
ed with fatal consequences to her; and&#xD;
in the next, I think it would be better to&#xD;
break it out to her by degrees, and make&#xD;
the circumstance subservient to my de-&#xD;
signs upon her.'&#xD;
'That is my opinion,' remarked Jen&#xD;
kins. 'but you are a fool, Blodget, to de-&#xD;
lay the indulgence of your desires so&#xD;
long, when you have it in your power to&#xD;
gratify them immediately.' If you wait&#xD;
until you prevail upon the lady to con.'&#xD;
sent. I think you will be likely to tarry a&#xD;
&#xD;
long while.' ' That is your opinion ?'  tf&#xD;
'It is.' y&#xD;
' Mine is a different one.'&#xD;
'You must have a very high opinion&#xD;
of your powers of captivation, if that is&#xD;
really your belief,' returned Jenkins. m&#xD;
' Perhaps so,' said Blodget, ' but time tr&#xD;
will show ; and now that I have the pros-&#xD;
pect of getting. this fellow into my pow-&#xD;
er, I am the more disposed to wait pa-&#xD;
tiently and give my plans a fair trial.'m&#xD;
'And wait until de Castro or his friends n&#xD;
discover the retreat of the lady, force her&#xD;
from your power, and bring you to pun-&#xD;
ishment,' rejoined Jenkins.          s&#xD;
'If Gordon is successful, there will be&#xD;
no fear of that.'  ,.&#xD;
Sd&#xD;
' May be so; but you remember thev&#xD;
old proverb-" a bird in hand is worth&#xD;
two in the bush."'  .&#xD;
' At any rate, I have made up my mind I&#xD;
to run the chance of it.'&#xD;
' Well, of course, you are at liberty to 1&#xD;
do as you think proper,' observed the cap-&#xD;
tain; but if you succeed in getting this&#xD;
youngster in our power, where do youth&#xD;
think of placing him ?'&#xD;
'Know you of any person that can bel&#xD;
trusted with him?'&#xD;
'I do.'               -&#xD;
' And does he reside far from  this&#xD;
place?'&#xD;
' Close upon the spot.'&#xD;
'Is the place obscure?$'&#xD;
' It is little frequented.'&#xD;
'Apd who is he ?'&#xD;
'One of my gang ; you may depend&#xD;
upon him.'&#xD;
''Tis well; and you think he will ac-&#xD;

'I am  certain of it ; he would do it&#xD;

arated, and Blodget bent his way to th&#xD;
ranch, to write the letter to Gordon&#xD;
elated at the prospect of the-success o&#xD;
his diabolical stratagems, and determine&#xD;
at any expense, or danger to prosecute&#xD;
them.&#xD;
In the epistle he gave Gordon all th&#xD;
information he couldrequire, and-highl)&#xD;
praised his indefatigability, at the sam(&#xD;
time encouraging him to further exer&#xD;
tions, bythe promise of rewarding hin&#xD;
accordingly.&#xD;
The letter was immediately forwarded&#xD;
to the proper quarter, and had not long&#xD;
done so, when Jenkins returned..&#xD;
'Well, captain, how have you suc&#xD;
cedeed ' asked Blodget.&#xD;
'As I anticipated.'&#xD;
'Then the man is w illing.,&#xD;
'lHe is.:'&#xD;
'And think you we may depend upon&#xD;
his secresy 1'&#xD;
' There is no fear of that'!'&#xD;
'Didyou not bind him by an oath I'&#xD;
'There was no necessity for that ! Kit-&#xD;
son's word is his bond.'&#xD;
'And did you. make him acquainted&#xD;
with the particulars '           .&#xD;
' I was compelled to, to. enable him&#xD;
to be. more upon his guard.'&#xD;
'Ay, true ! And you mentioned the&#xD;
reward ,?&#xD;
'It is not so much as I anticipated,'&#xD;
'What'is itI'&#xD;
'He demands two hundred dollars.'&#xD;
'It shall be his freely, immediately the&#xD;
fellow is placed in.his care, one hundred&#xD;
more to 'that, if he well perform his task,&#xD;
and keeps the secret inviolable.'&#xD;
'Itell you.-again, there is no fear of&#xD;
his not doing that.'&#xD;
r, Then all, sofar is well,? observed blod-&#xD;
get.&#xD;
&#xD;
o    'It shall be so ; and now we will have&#xD;
a glass or two together, to drink success&#xD;
)f to this undertaking.'&#xD;
d    'With all my heart,' replied the cap-&#xD;
e tain ; ' and taking his seat, bottles were&#xD;
immediately placed upon the table, and&#xD;
e they proceeded to drink with much alac-&#xD;
Y rity, toast after toast following each other&#xD;
e in rapid succession, while the deep. pota-&#xD;
- tions which they quaffed, took but a&#xD;
trifling effect upon them, so accustomed&#xD;
were they to habits of intemperance.&#xD;
'Perhaps,' said Blodget, after a pause,-&#xD;
it would have been much mcre satis-&#xD;
factory had Gordon succeeded in des-&#xD;
patching him.'&#xD;
'I like not the unnecessary shedding&#xD;
of human blood.'&#xD;
'Then you have never felt-the senti-&#xD;
ments that I do.'&#xD;
'You know not that ; but, villain as I&#xD;
am, and have been from a boy, I never&#xD;
yet shed the blood of my fellow man, un-&#xD;
less it was in a fight and in self defence.'&#xD;
'And yet you would have insisted up&#xD;
on one of your fellows committing mur-&#xD;
der, had not Gordon undertaken to do it.'&#xD;
'Because I had pledged my word to&#xD;
you that it should be done, and nothing&#xD;
would have induced me to break it.'&#xD;
'Ha! ha-! ha!' laughed out Blodgeb;&#xD;
'there's honor for you, in the captain of&#xD;
a desperate gang of robbers.'&#xD;
'Ay you may mock me, if you think&#xD;
proper, but I have spoken the truth.'&#xD;
Blodget made no further observation,&#xD;
but walked away, and Jenkins rejoined&#xD;
his companions at their rendezvous.&#xD;
In the meantime Inez' situation was&#xD;
just as helpless as ever, and Bloclget dai-&#xD;
ly continued to annoy her with import'&#xD;
&#xD;
nities, and hourly became more bold and&#xD;
confident in his manners towards her,&#xD;
and she noticed it, and could not help&#xD;
thinking that something had happened&#xD;
to occasion this alteration in his beha-&#xD;
vior, and at times her mind felt some&#xD;
severe misgivings, which she found it im-&#xD;
possible to comprehend. Blodget had&#xD;
not, however, yet mentioned anything,&#xD;
and, therefore, she could not entertain&#xD;
any positive suspicion.&#xD;
So well secured was every place, that&#xD;
our heroine had long ago given up all&#xD;
idea of escaping, and rested her only&#xD;
hope of deliverance upon her friends dis-&#xD;
covering her place of confinement ; but&#xD;
a circumstance, a short time after this,&#xD;
happened, which gave her some reason&#xD;
to hope.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the utter disgust&#xD;
which our heroine ever evinced in the&#xD;
company of the old woman, she persist-&#xD;
ed in obtruding her society upon her at&#xD;
every opportunity, and, as we have be-&#xD;
fore stated, it was very evident that she&#xD;
felt a pleasure in making Inez miserable.&#xD;
Guilt is always envious of the virtues it&#xD;
never possessed, and feels a delight in&#xD;
evincing its hatred of its possessor in ev-&#xD;
ery possible way. This, however, she&#xD;
concealed from Blodget, well aware that&#xD;
he would not approve of it, and Inez con-&#xD;
sidered it too contemptible to take any&#xD;
notice of it, and if she had, she would&#xD;
not have troubled herself to mention it&#xD;
to her persecutor, who might feel, little&#xD;
disposed to trouble himself in the matter&#xD;
The woman would make any excus&#xD;
to be in the same room with our heroine&#xD;
and when she was tired of talking to her&#xD;
Ines seldom condescending her a reply&#xD;
she would sing portions of vulgar song&#xD;
is a manner which would have don&#xD;
honor to Sydney Valley in its darkest&#xD;
&#xD;
days. The mind of Ines, however, was&#xD;
so fully occupied with her own thoughts&#xD;
that she seldom paid any attention to&#xD;
to her, and not unfrequently was she al-&#xD;
most entirely unconscious of her pres-&#xD;
ence.&#xD;
It was one evening, a short time after&#xD;
the events which we have been recording&#xD;
had taken place, that the hag paid our&#xD;
heroine her accustomed and unwelcome&#xD;
visit, and, as soon as she entered the&#xD;
room, Inez could perceive that she had&#xD;
been drinking and was quite intoxicated.&#xD;
This circumstance rather alarmed her, for&#xD;
she was afraid that the old woman being&#xD;
thus excited, might be guilty of some&#xD;
excesses; but still she reflected, she had&#xD;
nothing to apprehend from her, as the&#xD;
persons who were in the ranch would be'&#xD;
sure to come to her aid, and thus she&#xD;
was in safety. But to be alone, and in&#xD;
the power of wretches who cared not&#xD;
what crime they committed, was suffi-&#xD;
cient of itself to fill her mind with ter-&#xD;
ror, and she had great difficulty in sup-&#xD;
porting her feelings.&#xD;
The old woman staggered to a seat,&#xD;
for she could scarcely stand, and having&#xD;
dropped into it, she raised her blood-shot&#xD;
eyes towards the countenance of our he.&#xD;
roine, and fixed upon her a look expres-&#xD;
sive of her usual malevolence. Ines&#xD;
averted her head, and, taking up a book,&#xD;
l pretended to be reading ; but the old&#xD;
t woman was not to be diverted that way,&#xD;
e and, after several ineffectual attempts to&#xD;
speak, she stammered out-&#xD;
e   ' They are all gone out but one man,&#xD;
, and he has fallen asleep by the fire, and&#xD;
, so I thought I would come up stairs and&#xD;
, keep you company, you are fond of my&#xD;
s, company, I know.'&#xD;

at dry hiccups, and the disgusting old wo&#xD;

&#xD;
man rolled about in the chair apparently&#xD;
in the most uncomfortable manner. Inez&#xD;
trembled, but she endeavored to conceal&#xD;
her fears as much as possible, and pre-&#xD;
tended to be continuing to read the book&#xD;
she held in her hand, and did not make&#xD;
any reply.&#xD;
'Mr. Blodget is a very foolish man,'&#xD;
continued the old woman-' he is a very&#xD;
foolish man, or he would not stand shil-&#xD;
ly-shallying and dilly-dallying with you,&#xD;
my fine lady, in the manner he has. Such&#xD;
squeamish minxes, indeed ; poh!'&#xD;
- We need not attempt to describe the&#xD;
feelings of our heroine, while the old&#xD;
woman was-thus proceeding ; she endea-&#xD;
vored to close her ears to the words she&#xD;
was giving utterance to, but in vain, and&#xD;
the disgust which she felt was most ung&#xD;
bounded.&#xD;
4Why don't you answer me? ' de-&#xD;
manded the beldame in a surly tone ; 'I&#xD;
suppose you think yourself above me,&#xD;
don'trou,? But I can tell you you are&#xD;
not. You are a prisoner, but I am not,&#xD;
and-&#xD;
A very long yawn stopped the old&#xD;
woman's tirade, and her head dropped&#xD;
upon the table. She muttered two or&#xD;
three incoherent words, and shortly after-&#xD;
wards ber loud snoring convinced our&#xD;
heroine that the effects of the liquor she&#xD;
had been drinking had overpowered her,&#xD;
and that she had fallen off to sleep.-&#xD;
Inez laid down her book; a sudden&#xD;
thought darted across her mind, and her&#xD;
heart palpitated with emotion. She re-&#xD;
membered what the woman had said&#xD;
about there being but one man in the&#xD;
house, and that he was asleep below.-&#xD;
The room door was open-the old wo-&#xD;
man slept soundly, and she was not-&#xD;
likely to be awakened easily--a famous&#xD;
opportunity presented itself for her to&#xD;
&#xD;
attempt to make her escape. The chance&#xD;
was worth encountering any danger in&#xD;
making the effort, and she determined to&#xD;
avail herself of it.&#xD;
Hastily putting on her shawl, Inez&#xD;
mentally invoked the assistance of Hea-&#xD;
ven, and then, with noiseless footsteps,&#xD;
approached the chair on which the old&#xD;
woman was sitting, to make sure that she&#xD;
was not assuming drunkenness and sleep,&#xD;
and she was soon convinced that she was&#xD;
not. She now lightly stepped on to the&#xD;
landing, and closing the door gently up-&#xD;
on the unconscious old woman, locked it&#xD;
after her, and thus left her a secure pri-&#xD;
soner. She then leant her head over the&#xD;
bannisters, and listened attentively, but&#xD;
hearing no noise below, she was in lope&#xD;
that all was right, and ventured to begin&#xD;
to descend the stairs.&#xD;
Having passed down one flight, she&#xD;
once more paused and listened attentive-&#xD;
ly, but all remained as still as death, and&#xD;
her hopes became more sanguine.&#xD;
At length she reached the door of the&#xD;
parlor, which was closed, and Inez hesi-&#xD;
tated, and her heart beat so vehemently&#xD;
against her side that she could scarcely&#xD;
support herself.&#xD;
'Courage, Courage!' she whispered to-&#xD;
herself, ' this is the critical moment. Let&#xD;
me be firm, and I may escape.'&#xD;
Her trembling and hesitation decreas-&#xD;
ed as these thoughts crossed her mind,&#xD;
and she laid her hand on the handle of&#xD;
the door. It opened with a creaking&#xD;
noise, which again excited her fear, lest&#xD;
it should arouse the man; but her alarm&#xD;
was, fortunately groundless. A light&#xD;
was burning on the table, and the fire&#xD;
east forth a cheerful blaze, and by their&#xD;
light our heroine beheld a ruffian seated&#xD;
in the chair, his arms folded across his&#xD;
chest, and fast asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
Inez's heart bounded, and hope was&#xD;
strengthened tenfold. The near prospect&#xD;
of liberty excited in her breast a feeling&#xD;
of extacy which may be conceived but&#xD;
cannot be described. The moon shone&#xD;
brightly in at the window, and its silvery&#xD;
beams seemed to smile encouragement&#xD;
upon her. Another moment, she re-&#xD;
flected, and she might inhale the pure&#xD;
air, and be as free. The thought nerved&#xD;
her on ; and knowing that every moment&#xD;
was fraught with danger, she determined&#xD;
to act with promptitude. But the sleep-&#xD;
ing ruffian was so seated that she could&#xD;
not gain the door without passing him&#xD;
closely, and then she must act with the&#xD;
greatest caution or she might arouse&#xD;
him. She advanced one step, but hastily&#xD;
retreated again, hearing him yawn, and&#xD;
he seemed as if he was about to awaken&#xD;
She stood in trembling suspense, but it&#xD;
was. not for long ; the man having&#xD;
stretched out his arms, and yawned two&#xD;
or three times, sunk back on his chai&#xD;
again, and his loud snoring soon con&#xD;
vinced her that he was again asleep.&#xD;
She now once more commended her&#xD;
self to the protection of Heaven, an&#xD;
again advanced towards the door. Sh&#xD;
had passed the sleeping ruffian--th&#xD;
door was in her hand, and liberty wa&#xD;
just before her ; when there was a lou&#xD;
noise, like that of some heavy weigh&#xD;
falling, from the room above ; and Ine&#xD;
was so alarmed that she had not th&#xD;
power of moving one way or the othe&#xD;
but stood at the door trembling violently&#xD;
The noise immediately aroused th&#xD;
man, and, hastily starting to his feet, I&#xD;
rubbed his eyes, and stared eager&#xD;
around the room. They instantly rested&#xD;
on our unfortunate heroine, and, giving&#xD;
utterance to a dreadful oath, he rush(&#xD;
towards her, and seizing her fiercely t&#xD;
&#xD;
the arm, dragged her back. Inez sunk&#xD;
upon her knees, and in terrified accents&#xD;
exclaimed-&#xD;
' Oh, mercy, mercy ! spare me-save&#xD;
me, for the love of Heaven, save me 1'&#xD;
' Ah ! you would escape ?' exclaimed&#xD;
the ruffian ; 'speak, answer me-how&#xD;
did you contrive to leave the apartment&#xD;
in which you have been confined 1'&#xD;
The ruffian looked ferociously upon&#xD;
her while he spoke, and Inez trembled&#xD;
more violently than before when she&#xD;
gazed upon the frightful features of the&#xD;
man. Her lips quivered, and in vain&#xD;
did she endeavor to articulate a syllable.&#xD;
'Speak, I tell you again !' demanded&#xD;
the villain ; 'how came you hither ?&#xD;
By what means did you contrive to&#xD;
leave the room?'&#xD;
' The door was left unfastened,' faul-&#xD;
tered out Inez'; 'oh, do not harm me.'&#xD;
The door left unfastened?' repeated&#xD;
the man ; ' who left it so?'&#xD;
r   ' The woman.'&#xD;
' Ah ! the old bag-if she has done&#xD;
this she shall answer for it. But where&#xD;
- is she?'&#xD;
I    ' In the room I have just quitted, and&#xD;
e asleep,' replied Inez.&#xD;
e   ' Ah! I see how it is ; myself and her&#xD;
s have been indulging ourselves rather too&#xD;
d freely, and both are equally to blame ;&#xD;
t we must be more cautious for the future.&#xD;
z Come, my girl, you must allow me to es-&#xD;

ly of the uselessness of appealing to the&#xD;
ed flinty heart of the wretch, 'do not con-&#xD;

&#xD;
me to escape. - Believe me, you shall be-&#xD;
amply rewarded for such an inestimable&#xD;
service.'&#xD;
'Oh, no,' returned the ruffian and a&#xD;
malignant grin overspread- his counte-&#xD;
mance; 'it won't do,I'm not to de caught&#xD;
in that way; I can very well understand&#xD;
what, my reward would be, but they must&#xD;
catch me before they give it me. Ha!&#xD;
ha ! hatI Come, come, you must come&#xD;
with me, or I must use force--that's all&#xD;
about it.',&#xD;
Poor Inez clasped her hands in the in-&#xD;
tensity:of her grief, and finding that it&#xD;
would be useless ,to entreat any further,&#xD;
with a despairing heart, she slowly re-&#xD;
traced her footstepsto the chamber from&#xD;
which she had so recently escaped, fol-&#xD;
lowed by the wretch.&#xD;
On opening the door they found the&#xD;
old woman stretched at full length upon&#xD;
the floor; and it was-evident that it was&#xD;
from her that the noise had proceeded,&#xD;
which so unfortunately aroused the man,&#xD;
and:prevented her escape, at the very&#xD;
moment when the chance was before her.&#xD;
It was some time before the thief could&#xD;
arouse the old woman to sensibility, and&#xD;
when she did so, he commanded her&#xD;
sternly to follow'him.&#xD;
'Hey day!' cried the hag, rubbing her&#xD;
eyes, and looking ,with stupified amaze-&#xD;
ment. at our heroine, who had sunk des-&#xD;
pairingly in a chair, and leaning her el-&#xD;
bow upon the table, and her head upon&#xD;
her hand, was weeping bitterly; 'what's&#xD;
the matter now ?'=&#xD;
A What's the matter l' reiterated the&#xD;
ahy, that 'through your infernal&#xD;
stupidity the bird had nearly flown.'&#xD;
'Ah--what, do you mean to say that&#xD;
she had nearly escaped' croaked forth&#xD;
the old womin andshelooked more sav-&#xD;
age than ever at Inest:&#xD;
&#xD;
'Yes, I mean to say that she would&#xD;
have escaped,' replied he, ' and a pretty.&#xD;
scrape we should then both have got in-&#xD;
to.'&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
,f&#xD;
&#xD;
' Why, where was I at the time!'&#xD;
'Fast asleep, and a safe prisoner in this&#xD;
room, locked in.'&#xD;
' Locked in !' ejaculated the beldame,&#xD;
'oh, I see it all now, that confounded&#xD;
gin got the better of me, and you too, -I&#xD;
think, and, therefore, one is as much to&#xD;
blame as the other. We ought to thank&#xD;
our lucky stars that it has turned out as&#xD;
it has. But the artful jade, to lock me&#xD;
in, to-to--'&#xD;
' There, that's enough,' interrupted the&#xD;
fellow, ' you would stand talking here all&#xD;
night. We will leave the~lady "to her&#xD;
own reflections, which, doubtless, will not&#xD;
be very pleasant. Blodget will be home&#xD;
shortly, I expect, and, should he find us&#xD;
together, he might suspect something&#xD;
wrong. Good night, my lady, and when&#xD;
you next try to escape, you had better&#xD;
use- a little more expedition with your&#xD;
caution. Come, we must see and ar-&#xD;
range this business somehow or anoth-&#xD;
er.'&#xD;
The old woman fixed upon Inez one&#xD;
more malicious look, and appeared to ex-&#xD;
ult in the agony she was undergoing at&#xD;
having been thwarted in her attempt,&#xD;
and then following the wretch, they both&#xD;
quitted the room, and secured the door&#xD;
after them.  -&#xD;
They both congratulated themselves&#xD;
when they had got below, that Inez had&#xD;
not been successful, and were determined&#xD;
to be more cautious in future. Another&#xD;
moment, and our heroine would have&#xD;
been at liberty, and they trembled when&#xD;
they reflected upon the consegtae&#xD;
that would have been certain to follow&#xD;
her escape: They both, however, con-&#xD;
&#xD;
sidered that it would be better for them&#xD;
not to mention anything about it.to Blod-&#xD;
get or the others, as it would only excite&#xD;
his suspicions that all was not right, and&#xD;
probably deprive them of his confidence&#xD;
and friendship, which, as he was very&#xD;
liberal, was not to be treated lightly.&#xD;
Thus the affair was amicably arranged&#xD;
between the two worthies, and- the old&#xD;
spitfire determined to annoy our unfortu-&#xD;
nate heroine more than ever, for the 'au-&#xD;
dacious' (as she termed it) attempt she&#xD;
had made to escape, and moreover, for&#xD;
her unparalleled presumption and atroci-&#xD;
ty, in having actually made her a prison-&#xD;
er in the very place where she had been&#xD;
herself confined.&#xD;
As for poor Inez, she was completely&#xD;
overwhelme' with the intensity of her&#xD;
anguish and disappointment, and forsome&#xD;
time after the man and the old woman&#xD;
had left her, she remained in almost a&#xD;
state of unconsciousness.&#xD;
' Alas,' she at last ejaculated, beating&#xD;
her breast, 'fate has conspired against&#xD;
me, and I am doomed to perpetual mis-&#xD;
ery. Am I never to escape from the&#xD;
power of these wretches?  Has the Om-&#xD;
nipotentBeing entirely forsaken me? Oh,&#xD;
God ! let me die rather than live to en-&#xD;
dure this succession of miseries and dis-&#xD;
appointments.'&#xD;
She clasped her burning temples, and&#xD;
arising from her chair, traversed the room&#xD;
in the greatest possible agony. If Blod-&#xD;
get should become acquainted with the&#xD;
circumstance, she could not help think-&#xD;
ing that he would be induced to adopt&#xD;
even more stringent measures towards&#xD;
her ; but then she consoled herself with&#xD;
the reflection that it was not likely that&#xD;
the man or the old woman would let&#xD;
him know anything about it, as they&#xD;
would be blamed for neglect, and Blodget&#xD;
&#xD;
OF SAN FRANCISCO. -                179&#xD;
&#xD;
would deem it prudent to remove her to&#xD;
some other place of confinement. She&#xD;
passed two or three hours in the greatest&#xD;
state of agitation, and could not venture&#xD;
to retire to rest, but listened to the slight-&#xD;
est sound which proceeded from below,&#xD;
fearing to hear the villain Blodget return&#xD;
home.&#xD;
At length all was still in the house,&#xD;
and tired out with thinking, Inez com-&#xD;
mitted herself to the care of Providence,&#xD;
and undressing herself, hastened into&#xD;
bed, and, in spite of the state of her mind,&#xD;
after the painful event which we have&#xD;
been detailing, she was so weary, that it&#xD;
was not long ere she sunk to sleep&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
The Seducer Resisted.&#xD;
Wa left our heroine in a calm slumber,&#xD;
into which she had sunk after the fatigue&#xD;
of thinking and the anguish of her mind.&#xD;
She continued in it until a storm arose,&#xD;
which awoke her, and jumping up in the&#xD;
bed, she scarcely knew where she was.&#xD;
Confused thoughts darted across her per-&#xD;
turbed imagination, and she had in an&#xD;
instant a foreboding, a presentiment, that&#xD;
something particular was about to occur&#xD;
to her. She heard no one but the old&#xD;
woman moving below, and recollecting&#xD;
that she had seen Blodget quit the house&#xD;
at an early hour in the morning, she&#xD;
thought it was probable that he had not&#xD;
yet returned, and she became rather more&#xD;
composed. Then, however, she remem-&#xD;
bered some dark hints which the hateful&#xD;
old woman had thrown out to her iin the&#xD;
morning, and again were her utmost ap-&#xD;
prehensions of some fresh misery excited,&#xD;

pospetime she continued in this manner,&#xD;
when she heard a confusion of voices&#xD;
from  below, among which she distin-&#xD;
guished that of a female and Blodget's,&#xD;
but she could not understand a single&#xD;
word that they gave utterance to.&#xD;
Shp now endeavored to calm her feel-&#xD;
ings, and prepare for the meeting which&#xD;
'she had no doubt would take place be-&#xD;
tween her and Blodget ; who she resolved&#xD;
to meet with all the fortitude she could&#xD;
possibly muster. She knelt down, and-&#xD;
su1pplicated the aid of the Almighty ; and&#xD;
implored that He would frustrate the de-&#xD;
signs of the wicked, and not suffer her&#xD;
to fall a victim to the diabolical strata-&#xD;
gems of the miscreant who at present&#xD;
held her in his power&#xD;
As it ever is the case, when the sincere&#xD;
heart breathes its prayers to Heaven, our&#xD;
heroine felt, almost immediately more&#xD;
tranquil and prepared to meet her op-&#xD;
pressor, and she arose from her knees_&#xD;
with a determination to support herself&#xD;
with- an air of fortitude, which should&#xD;
abash rather than encourage the villain's&#xD;
nefarious hopes.&#xD;
She hAd not long come to this resol.u-&#xD;
tion, when she heard a footstep ascending&#xD;
the stairs, and shortly afterwards the door&#xD;
of. her apartment wasunbolted, and the&#xD;
door was opened, and the object of her&#xD;
hatred and her fears presented himself&#xD;
" before her. She met his looks firmly,&#xD;
and with an air of becoming dignity, and&#xD;
it was evident, although he endeavored&#xD;
t disguise it, that something of more&#xD;
importance than usual occupied his&#xD;
tlgoughts.&#xD;
He stood for a second or two in the&#xD;
doorway, and seemed anxious to address&#xD;
her, yet at a loss how to begin.,Then he&#xD;
semed-abashed at the calm dignity of-&#xD;
Inez's manner, and at the same time Jost&#xD;
&#xD;
in admiration of her extreme beauty,&#xD;
which, although much impaired by the&#xD;
ravages of care, was still most superla-&#xD;
tive.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the firmness which&#xD;
she assumed, Inez felt a trembling appre-&#xD;
hension of the interview ; and had much&#xD;
difficulty in conquering her feelings.&#xD;
At length Blodget advanced nearer to&#xD;
our heroine, closing the door after him,&#xD;
and after several. ineffectual attempts to&#xD;
speak, he observed, in as insinuating&#xD;
tone as he could assume-&#xD;
' Beauteous Inez, after a temporary ab-&#xD;
sence from your presence, which has ap-&#xD;
peared an age to me, I again come to&#xD;
bask in the sunshine of your beauty--&#xD;
again to solicit a return of that passion&#xD;
which I so ardently feel for you.'&#xD;
' Villain !' ejaculated Inez, 'receive my&#xD;
answer in the utter contempt, disgust,&#xD;
abhorrence I feel for you; and rest as-&#xD;
sured that no other feeling can ever in-&#xD;
habit my breast towards a wretch who&#xD;
has proved himself destitute of every&#xD;
feeling of humanity.'&#xD;
'this violence is useless,' returned&#xD;
Blodget; 'I have given you plenty of&#xD;
time to consider: 'this day I come hither&#xD;
to decide : I have waited patiently long&#xD;
enough.'&#xD;
'Monster !' cried the distracted lady,&#xD;
and her eyes at the same time beamed&#xD;
an expression which seemed as if it would&#xD;
penetrate to his soul; where is my poor&#xD;
father, from whom you have so merciless-&#xD;

unparalleled act of cruelty you have been-&#xD;
guilty of, and yet stand there and talk to&#xD;
me, the affianced bride of another, about&#xD;

To all these passionate expressions I&#xD;
pay little or no attention; for they affect&#xD;
me not,' returned the hardened villain,&#xD;
&#xD;
'It is enough that I have fixed my mind Is there any epithet strong enough&#xD;
on you; I have labored hard, and risked that I can apply to a man like you ?' de-&#xD;
much, to get possession of you-you are handed Inez. 'Has not your conduct&#xD;

'Oh, heartless miscreant.'        and a slight scowl passed over his brows,&#xD;
'Nay, think not that I would willingly ' I do not mind a little flattery, but when&#xD;

Inez shuddered with horror at the cool-&#xD;
ness and effrontery with which the liber-&#xD;
tine uttered these expressions, and she&#xD;
could scarcely believe that she was stand-&#xD;
ing in the presence of a human being.&#xD;
'Oh, no,' replied Blodget, 'think not&#xD;
that I can be induced to leave you so&#xD;
soon this day, at any rate. Upon your&#xD;
determined answer your fate depends.'&#xD;
'You have already had my answer,'&#xD;
returned Inez.&#xD;
'Will nothing persuade you to alter&#xD;
it?' 1'&#xD;
' Nothing, by Heaven !'&#xD;
'Beware ! take not an oath !'-&#xD;
'I can with safety, for nothing would&#xD;
induce me to swerve from it.'&#xD;
'You had better bethink yourself.'&#xD;
'I have thought sufficiently, and I am&#xD;
decided.''&#xD;
' Recollect that, if you refuse, I shall&#xD;
be compelled to resort to force.'&#xD;
' I will die first.'&#xD;
'You will not Save the means.'&#xD;
'Almighty God surely,will never suffer&#xD;
so black a deed.'&#xD;
'-Bah ;--that is all idle cant. Think,&#xD;
too, that if you refuse, you will still be&#xD;
kept here a prisoner, deprived of every&#xD;
comfort, and yet subservient to my&#xD;
wishes.''&#xD;
'Oh, horror . You cannot surely be&#xD;

'I would not willingly, but you wonid&#xD;

'Oh, repent, repent!'&#xD;
'Phaw ! Will that gratify my de--&#xD;

'It will afford me a far greater gratifi-&#xD;

'I want not to hear them, they cannot&#xD;
make any alteration in my determination,'&#xD;
answered our heroine, covering her face&#xD;
with her handkerchief, and sobbing aloud&#xD;
with her disgusted and wounded feelings.&#xD;
'Still must I think that you will change&#xD;
your mind ; returned Blodget with the&#xD;
same guilty expression of countenance in&#xD;
which his features were almost constant-&#xD;
ly clad-' remember the sweets of liberty&#xD;

' And of what use would liberty be to&#xD;
me, when it would be purchased by a&#xD;
life of infamyI' demanded Inez; 'could&#xD;
anything ever reconcile it to my con-&#xD;
science, to become the base paramour of&#xD;
a guilty being like you?  The bare&#xD;
thought fills me with a sensation of the&#xD;
utmost dread, and death in its most hor-&#xD;
rible form would be preferable to such a&#xD;
course of.life.'&#xD;
'But is there nothing that could pre-&#xD;
vail upon you ?'&#xD;
'Nothing;' answered Inez, with a look&#xD;
of the greatest disgust and horror.&#xD;
'Think again '&#xD;
'I have nothing more to say upon the&#xD;
detested subject.'&#xD;
'If, by so doing, you could purchase&#xD;

deadly pale, and clutching the arm ;of&#xD;
Blodgett and with distended eye-lids ;--&#xD;

'He is in my power,'&#xD;
Poor Inez tried hard to speak, but&#xD;
she could not ; she was transfixed to the&#xD;
spot, and gazed upon Blodget with a&#xD;
look in which the greatest astonishment&#xD;
and horror were depicted. The an-&#xD;
nouncement of Blodget came like a&#xD;
thunderbolt upon her, and her faculties&#xD;
seemed to be all bound up in the sudden-&#xD;
ness and unexpectedness of the circum-&#xD;
stance.&#xD;
'If you are not a monster of the black-&#xD;

will not delight in thus harrowing my&#xD;
feelings! but tell me have-you spoken&#xD;
the truth ? Do not keep me in suspense!1&#xD;
Oh, do not ! Have you indeed said that&#xD;

'I have,' answered B!odget ;-' Mont-&#xD;

'Are you bent to drive me mad ?' ex-&#xD;
claimed the frenzied Inez, as, with clasp-,&#xD;

'No, no ! I would restore you to hap-&#xD;

' Happiness l' groaned Inez; ' oh, cruel&#xD;

and suspense.'&#xD;

had before spoken, and at the same time&#xD;
venturing to approach her closer ; 'com-&#xD;

' Never, miscreant.' cried Inez, and&#xD;
fell powerless to the floor.&#xD;
Blodget was alarmed,-so still and&#xD;
marble-like did the fair girl lie. No mo-&#xD;
tion of her white bosom gave the slight-&#xD;
est evidence that she breathed.&#xD;
The villain trembled, and for an in-&#xD;
stant remorse touched his heart. But&#xD;
no sooner did a slight convulsive shudder&#xD;
show that she still lived, than he turned&#xD;
and left the apartment.&#xD;
Blodget sent the old woman to Ines,&#xD;
who succeeded in restoring her to con-&#xD;

Alice, probably thinking it was .the&#xD;

started back with no little amazement,,&#xD;
when she beheld the villain Blodget.-&#xD;
He instantly stepped into the room, and&#xD;
Inez hearing the exclamation which Al-&#xD;
ice had given utterance to came from her&#xD;
room, but on seeing Blodget, she turned&#xD;
very pale, and trembled so violently that&#xD;
she could scarcely prevent herself from&#xD;
sinking on the floor.&#xD;
The forbidding features of Blodget re-&#xD;
laxed into a smile, which he meant to be&#xD;
one of kindness, but he could not con-&#xD;
ceal his exultation, and the guilty pas-&#xD;
sions that raged like a tempest within his&#xD;
bosom, and turning to Alice, he said, in&#xD;
an authoritative tone-&#xD;
'Leave the room.'&#xD;
Alice hesitated, and looked at our her-&#xD;
oine.&#xD;
'Do you hear?' demanded Blodget, in&#xD;
a louder tone;-' begone, I've something&#xD;

'You should have nothing to say to&#xD;

'I'll remain where I am, sir, while it i&#xD;

firm tone.&#xD;

Immediately seizing Alice, as he spoke&#xD;

advanced towards Inez, who, up6n the&#xD;
impulse of the moment, was in the act&#xD;
of retreating to her chamber, and fast-&#xD;
ening herself in, when the villain sprang&#xD;
quickly forward, and .seizing her vehe-&#xD;

'Unmanly ruffian!' cried Inez, 'un-&#xD;

your boldness and cruelty! What is the&#xD;
meaning of this savage outrage?'&#xD;
'It means, fair Inez,' replied Blodget,&#xD;

waist, and drawing her towards him,&#xD;
'that, finding I have too long been a for-&#xD;

thus screamed, she struggled violently&#xD;
to extricate herself from the embraces of&#xD;
the ruffian Blodget, but her efforts were&#xD;
for some time entirely ineffectual, and&#xD;
with every endeavor she made, the pas-&#xD;
sions of Blodget increased, and his cheeks&#xD;
glowed and his eyes flashed with the&#xD;
guilty desires that raged within his&#xD;
breast. He sought, however, to stifle&#xD;
her cries, but in vain.&#xD;
'Nay,' he cried, ' you scream for help&#xD;
in vain ; there is no one at hand to in-&#xD;
terpose to save you ! The triumph so&#xD;
long protracted, now is mine ! This&#xD;
hour; this very moment gives you to&#xD;
my arms!'&#xD;
'Almighty God ! protect me ! save&#xD;
me ?' again shrieked our heroine, in the&#xD;
most frantic accents, and, with a des-&#xD;
perate effort she released herself from&#xD;
Blodget's hold, and retreated to the far-&#xD;
ther end of the apartment, where, on a&#xD;
table, was a knife. Scarcely knowing&#xD;
what she did, she snatched it up, and, as&#xD;
Blodget approached towards her, she&#xD;
flourished it menacingly, and exclaimed:&#xD;
'Villain ! advance but an inch towards&#xD;
me, and this knife shall stretch me a&#xD;
bleeding corpse at your feet!'&#xD;
Blodget was completely staggered by&#xD;
the determined air which Inez assumed,&#xD;
and he was transfixed to the spot where-&#xD;
on he stood, not knowing what course to&#xD;
pursue.&#xD;
Our heroine still flourished the knife&#xD;
menacingly, and kept the villain at bay.&#xD;
'You see I am resolute,' she cried ;&#xD;
' and, by Heaven, sooner than I will be&#xD;
dishonored, I will put my threat into ex-&#xD;
ecution !  Death is preferable to the&#xD;
dreadful, the disgusting fate which you&#xD;
have threatened me. Nay, nothing can&#xD;
move me from my purpose! Quit the&#xD;
room, miscreant; unless you-would have&#xD;
&#xD;
my death to answer for, in addition to&#xD;
your other numerous crimes !'&#xD;
'Inez,' ejaculated Blodget, offering to&#xD;
approach her ; 'hear me !'&#xD;
'Not a word,' firmly replied Inez ; 'no-&#xD;
thing whatever can shake my resolution;&#xD;
begone!&#xD;
At that moment a loud noise was&#xD;
heard at the chamber door, and imme-&#xD;
diately afterwards the voices of several&#xD;
persons.&#xD;
Blodget turned pale and trembled.&#xD;
'Ah I' he ejaculated.&#xD;
' Open the door, or it will be worse&#xD;
for you,' now demanded the voice of&#xD;
Gordon.&#xD;
'Never!' cried Blodget, desperately,&#xD;
and placing his back against it as he&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
'Then we must use force,' returned&#xD;
Gordon ; 'now, lads, your aid.'&#xD;
In an instant the door was burst open,&#xD;
and Gordon, followed by three rough-&#xD;
looking men, entered the room.&#xD;
'Seize him, my lads; and bear him&#xD;
hence I' cried Gordon, and in a moment&#xD;
the men rushed upon Blodget, who made&#xD;
a desperate resistance, but was quickly&#xD;
overpowered, and was conveyed, strug-&#xD;
gling, swearing, and foaming at the&#xD;
mouth, from the room, and being drag.&#xD;
ged to one of the dark vaults under-&#xD;
ground, was, by the orders of Gordon,&#xD;
locked in, and left to his own reflections,&#xD;
the nature of which may be readily con-&#xD;
jectured, but cannot be properly described.&#xD;
Alice, immediately on being thrust&#xD;
out of the room by Blodget, had hasten.&#xD;
ed below, where, ascertaining that Gor-&#xD;
don was from home, although it was&#xD;
very reluctantly that the old woman fur-&#xD;
nished her with the information, she&#xD;
made the best of her way to the cabaret,&#xD;
where she fortunately found him, in&#xD;
&#xD;
company with the men before mentioned,&#xD;
and having informed him of the perilous&#xD;
-situation of our heroine, he left the place,&#xD;
and, as has been shown, arrived just at&#xD;
the critical juncture, to save her from&#xD;
destruction.&#xD;
Blodget had no sooner been forced&#xD;
away from the room, than our heroine,&#xD;
overpowered by her feelings, and the unu-&#xD;
sual excite ent she had undergone, faint-&#xD;
ed, and Alice Hewlet was once more left&#xD;
alone with her, and immediately set&#xD;
about the means of restoring her sensi-&#xD;
bility.&#xD;
It would be impossible to pourtray&#xD;
correctly the disappointment and ungo-&#xD;
vernable rage of Blodget, when he found&#xD;
himself not only foiled in his diabolical&#xD;
attempt, but made a prisoner in that&#xD;
gloomy vault. He raved; he stormed ;&#xD;
he cursed and swore, and breathed the&#xD;
most fearful maledictions against Alice,&#xD;
Gordon, and Jenkins. Then he made&#xD;
the place re-echo again with his cries to&#xD;
be released, but the hollow reverbera-&#xD;
tions of that subterranean place, were&#xD;
the only answers he received, and he&#xD;
traversed the limited space in which he&#xD;
was confined, in a state bordering upon&#xD;
madness. He now at once saw that he&#xD;
was caught, trepanned, defeated, and all&#xD;
his well laid schemes rendered abortive,&#xD;
and himself left entirely at the mercy of&#xD;
Jenkins and his associates, and when he.&#xD;
recollected the threats which the former&#xD;
had held out to him, if he should make&#xD;
any attempt against the peace of Inez,&#xD;
during his absence, he felt that he had&#xD;
every reason to apprehend the most ter-&#xD;
rible consequences through his mad im-&#xD;
petuosity. All the horrors of an igno-&#xD;
minous death rushed upon his mind, and&#xD;
his anguish was so great, that he com-&#xD;
pletely sunk under it. He crouched&#xD;
&#xD;
down in one corner of his cell, and be-&#xD;
came the image of despair. It appeared&#xD;
as though his career of guilt was fast&#xD;
drawing to a close, and, that fate had&#xD;
destined, that every attempt he should&#xD;
in future make should be frustrated.&#xD;
In this state he remained for more&#xD;
than two hours, without any one ap-&#xD;
pearing to interrupt him, when he heard&#xD;
some one unbolting the door of his cell,&#xD;
and immediately afterwards it was thrown&#xD;
back on its hinges, and Gordon, accom-&#xD;
panied by one of the men who had been&#xD;
his companions in the seizure, entered.&#xD;
He brought with him a stone pitcher,&#xD;
containing water and a loaf, which he&#xD;
placed on the ground, and then eyed&#xD;
Blodget with a rook of the most malig-&#xD;
nant exultation.&#xD;
Blodget sprang to his feet; fury gleam-&#xD;
ing in his eyes, and advancing towards&#xD;
Gordon, he cried, in a hoarse voice&#xD;
'Dastard!-why am I thus seized and&#xD;
made a prisoner in this dismal place?4'&#xD;
'Recollect your recent conduct,' said&#xD;
Gordon coolly, ' and you are answered.'&#xD;
' And what authority has either he or&#xD;
you for detaining me?$' demanded Blod-&#xD;
get.&#xD;
' Upon that point I dare say you will&#xD;
be satisfied at a future time,' returned&#xD;
Gordon, in the same deliberate and care-&#xD;
less tones.&#xD;
'But you will not dare detain me?'&#xD;
'That has to be proved.'&#xD;
'Villain ! you will have to answer&#xD;
dearly for this,' said Blodget.&#xD;
' Previous to which,' retorted Gordon,&#xD;
ironically, 'you will probably be called&#xD;
to a slight account for the abduction and&#xD;
unlawful detention of the lady, also for a&#xD;
certain crime since, and -'&#xD;
'Confusion!' interrupted Blodget ;-&#xD;

MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
wretch?$ Oh, Jenkins ! Jenkins ! for this,&#xD;
my heaviest malediction light upon your&#xD;
head.'&#xD;
'Trusting that you may soon feel at&#xD;
home in your new apartment,' said Gor-&#xD;
don, with a most provoking grin, ' I will&#xD;
now leave you to the enjoyment of it.&#xD;
Come on.'&#xD;
And thus saying, before Blodget could&#xD;
give utterance to another syllable, al-&#xD;
though his looks evinced the torturing&#xD;
feelings of chagrin, disappointment, and&#xD;
resentment he was undergoing, Gordon&#xD;
and his companion quitted the cell, and&#xD;
slammed and bolted the door after them,&#xD;
.leaving Blodget involved in utter dark-&#xD;
ness, for they had not supplied him with&#xD;
a lamp.&#xD;
Blodget threw himself on the hard&#xD;
ground, and-he groaned aloud with the&#xD;
agony of his feelings, but his present suf-&#xD;
ering was nothing compared with the&#xD;
horrors of anticipation, and he dreaded&#xD;
the return of Jenkins, fearing .that the&#xD;
terrible result would be that which he&#xD;
promised him.&#xD;
Three days and nights passed away in&#xD;
this manner, and Blodget was still kept&#xD;
a prisoner in the subterranean vault, and&#xD;
was daily visited by Gordon, who .came&#xD;
to bring him his scanty allowance of pro-&#xD;
visions, and to taunt him with his de-&#xD;
graded and altered situation. The un-&#xD;
happy wretch was at length completely&#xD;
subdued in spirit, and was incapable of&#xD;
answering the ruffian, and he was at last&#xD;
so humbled as to entreat Gordon's mercy,&#xD;
and to pray that he would release him&#xD;
from his present place of confinement&#xD;
to one less dismal. This request, how-&#xD;
ever, Gordon only treated with scorn and&#xD;
derision; so true it is that none feel&#xD;
greater pleasure than the guilty in tor-&#xD;
turing one another. Although Blodget&#xD;
&#xD;
had never given the ruffian the least&#xD;
cause for offence, but, on the contrary,&#xD;
according to his own admission, had lib-&#xD;
erally rewarded him for the nefarious ao&#xD;
tions in which he had employed him, he&#xD;
now felt the most savage delight in add-&#xD;
ing to his misery as much as possible ;&#xD;
and the more he saw him suffer, and the&#xD;
more humbled he was, the greater did&#xD;
he exult. He had no doubt he should&#xD;
receive great praise, and something far&#xD;
more substantial from Jenkins for the&#xD;
manner in which he. had acted, and he&#xD;
anticipated his return with much impa-&#xD;
tience. . He was not made thoroughly&#xD;
acquainted with Jenkins' intention as re-&#xD;
garded Inez, but he had not the least&#xD;
doubt it was to restore her to her friends,&#xD;
and he imagined he would ensure from&#xD;
them a rich reward, in which he also&#xD;
expected to become a sharer to no small.&#xD;
amount for the services he had rendered.&#xD;
How far his expectations -were realized,&#xD;
will be seen anon.&#xD;
When our heroine had quite recovered&#xD;
from the shock which she received from&#xD;
the behavior of the villain Blodget, she&#xD;
returned her most heartfelt thanks to the&#xD;
Almighty for her preservation, and for&#xD;
the fortitude with which she had been&#xD;
imbued to resist him. She then expres-&#xD;
sed her warmest acknowledgments to&#xD;
Alice, to whose presence of mind in&#xD;
hastening for the aid of Gordon, she&#xD;
might, in a great measure, attribute her&#xD;
preservation. The conduct of Gordon,&#xD;
who, there could not be the least doubt,&#xD;
acted entirely by the orders of Jenkins,&#xD;
left her no longer any room to doubt but&#xD;
that the latter was really the friend and&#xD;
protector he had told her was, and now&#xD;
that Blodget was thrust into confinement,&#xD;
from which they were assured he would&#xD;
not be released until the return of the&#xD;
&#xD;
188&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
captain, our heroine felt that she was&#xD;
safe.&#xD;
'What ready means guilt often un-&#xD;
thinkingly takes to defeat its own de-&#xD;
signs:' observed Alice ; 'Blodget thrust-&#xD;
ing me out of the room, was the very&#xD;
cause of bringing about his own confu-&#xD;
sion, and frustrating his evil intentions ;&#xD;
for, had he placed me in another room,&#xD;
and confined me therein, he might easily&#xD;
have silenced the old woman, had she&#xD;
been inclined to oppose him, and thus he&#xD;
would have been almost certain to have&#xD;
obtained his object.'&#xD;
'Oh, no,' returned Inez, 'my mind&#xD;
was made up ; never did I feel more de-&#xD;
termined, and he perceived it; I would&#xD;
have plunged the knife to my heart, soon-&#xD;
er than he would have triumphed in his&#xD;
disgusting and diabolical purpose 1'&#xD;
' Oh, Miss,' said Alice, ' the idea of&#xD;
that makes me shudder with horror !&#xD;
Heaven be praised, that preserved you&#xD;
from such a dreadful and untimely end.&#xD;
But the wretch will no doubt be amply&#xD;
punished for his crimes, and for all the&#xD;
sufferings that he has inflicted upon you.&#xD;
. 'And how think you that Jenkins will&#xD;
dispose of him?' interrogated Inez.&#xD;
'Deliver him up to the Vigilance Com&#xD;
mnittee,' replied Alice.&#xD;
'How can he do so without getting&#xD;
himself into trouble ?'&#xD;
' Oh, there is no doubt but that he wil&#xD;
readily hit upon a plan,' said Alice ; 'I&#xD;
dare say that he has already arrange&#xD;
that, without knowing anything of th&#xD;
late circumstance. Clear up, Miss, fo&#xD;
depend upon it, your troubles are fas&#xD;
drawing to a close, and not many day&#xD;
will elapse ere you will be again restore&#xD;
to your friends.'&#xD;
' Alas,' ejaculated Inez, tears gushin&#xD;
to her eyes, 'perhaps I have no dea&#xD;
&#xD;
friends to receive me ! Oh, how my poor&#xD;
heart chills at the thought.'&#xD;
' Pray, Miss,' said Alice, ' do not en-&#xD;
courage fears which, after all, may prove&#xD;
unfounded. Great, no doubt, as has&#xD;
been the sufferings of Monteagle and your&#xD;
father, I firmly believe that they are still&#xD;
living, or Jenkins and the others would&#xD;
have heard of it.'&#xD;
' My unhappy lover may have been&#xD;
able to withstand the severity of his&#xD;
accumulated and unparalleled calamities,'&#xD;
observed Inez ' but, my poor father ; oh,&#xD;
well am I convinced that his mind must&#xD;
have now become a wreck, in which&#xD;
case, it would be a mercy if the Almighty&#xD;
should be pleased to take him to Him-&#xD;
self. Peor grey-haired old man, fondest&#xD;
of parents, best of human beings, shall I&#xD;
ever again be enfolded to thy paternal&#xD;
bosom, with the conviction That thou art&#xD;
conscious it is thy poor persecuted daugh-&#xD;
ter thou dost embrace ?-Alas ! I fear&#xD;

'Oh, yes, Miss, you will,' ejaculated&#xD;
Alice, energetically, ' Heaven in its infin-&#xD;
ite mercy will not deny you such a bless-&#xD;
l ing after the many afflictions you have&#xD;
so undeservedly undergone. Have you&#xD;
not every reason to place the firmest re-&#xD;

e it is ungrateful in me thus to give way to&#xD;

made acquainted with intentions, which,&#xD;
as I have all along predicted, depend up-&#xD;
on it, will be all in your favor.'&#xD;
The ideas of Alice were too reasonable&#xD;
to be rejected by Inez, and she looked&#xD;
forward to the return of Jenkins with the&#xD;
greatest anxiety.&#xD;
A fortnight had noga waned away, and&#xD;
still Jenkins and his companions did not&#xD;
return, and Gordon, who did not expect&#xD;
that they would be gone so long, was.&#xD;
fearful lest some accident should have be.&#xD;
fallen them. He still kept the wretched&#xD;
Blodget confined-in the same place, and&#xD;
ne now became the -complete victim of&#xD;
despair. His form had wasted away, and&#xD;
his countenance betrayed the deep, the&#xD;
intense agony which perpetually tortured&#xD;
his mind. How dreary were the days&#xD;
ard nights passed in that dark cell, where&#xD;
he had nothing to commune but his own&#xD;
dreadful thoughts, and were the horror'&#xD;
of his own guilty conscience constantly&#xD;
brought to his imagination the many&#xD;
crimes he had committed. Conjecture&#xD;
cannot form but a weak picture of the&#xD;
mental sufferings of that man of crime.&#xD;
Oh, who would be guilty, did they but&#xD;
think upon the horrors that must sooner&#xD;
or later overtake them --For the gratifi-&#xD;
cation of some moment of sensual pleas-&#xD;
ure; for .the transitory indulgence of&#xD;
some ambitious wish, the unhappy wretch&#xD;
falls into crime, to pay for it by years of&#xD;
mental suffering, and ignominious death,&#xD;
and an eternity of torment !--Oh, how&#xD;
fearful the price, would but erring mor-&#xD;
tals pause and think !&#xD;
It was on a stormy midnight,.vhen&#xD;
nearly three weeks' had elapsed since Sen-&#xD;
kins had left, when a party who were in&#xD;
company-with Gordon in the little back&#xD;
room, smoking, were suddenly aroused&#xD;
&#xD;
by hearing a shrill whistle. The cigars&#xD;
were removed from their lips in an in-&#xD;
stant, and they jumped hastily to their&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
'Jenkins's signal, by all that's fortu-&#xD;
nate;' exclaimed Gordon, advancing to-&#xD;
wards the door, 'they have come back&#xD;
at last, and all safe, I hope!'&#xD;
' This has, indeed, been a long trip&#xD;
captain,' said Gordon 'and I had began&#xD;
to fear that you were never going to re-&#xD;
turn.'&#xD;
' Better late than never,' answered&#xD;
Jenkins; 'but how is all at the house?'&#xD;
'Quite safe, captain,' replied Gordon,&#xD;
with a peculiar grin, ' the lady is in her&#xD;
own apartments with her companion, Al-&#xD;
ice, and that arrant scoundrel Blodget,&#xD;
confined in one of the vaults underneath,&#xD;
where he has been since two or three&#xD;
days after your departure.'&#xD;
' Ah !' exclaimed Jenkins, 'has he then&#xD;
dared to scorn the warning that I gave&#xD;
him? ,'&#xD;
Gordon briefly related what had taken&#xD;
place between Blodget and our heroine.&#xD;
' Why, the damned villain !' cried Jen-&#xD;
kins, passionately ; 'after the strict in-&#xD;
junctions which I laid upon him, and&#xD;
knowing that he was placed entirely at&#xD;
my mercy. But he shall pay dearly for&#xD;
it; his doom is sealed.'&#xD;
' I did not know whether you would&#xD;
approve of the lodging I had given the&#xD;
fellow,' answered Gordon.&#xD;
' You have acted perfectly right,' said&#xD;
Jenkins ; ' and I commend you for what&#xD;
you have done. Blodget shall quickly&#xD;
have another berth, and his career he&#xD;
may reckon at an end. And is the lady&#xD;
quite well?'&#xD;
Gordon answered in the affirmative.&#xD;

answered Jenkins.- ' To-morrow night,  'Oh, Blodget,' he cried, in the most&#xD;

'You would not deprive him of life ?' I will acknowledge I was wrong; but let&#xD;

learned that his name was de Castro, and&#xD;
that you were his child. I managed to&#xD;
have word conveyed to him that his&#xD;
daughter was safe, and would soon be re-&#xD;
stored to his arms. I have now hastened&#xD;
here to   carry you back, and devise&#xD;
means to give Bludget up to Justice.&#xD;
-This cannot be done so speedily or easily&#xD;
as I could wish, for the villain is master&#xD;
of too many secrets involving perhaps&#xD;
the lives of members of my band, for me&#xD;
to proceed rashly in the matter. Mean-&#xD;
while be cheerful, Alice will remain with&#xD;
&#xD;
you, and in a few days you will be with&#xD;
your father.'&#xD;
Inez fervently thanked Jenkins, and&#xD;
throwing herself on her knees poured&#xD;
out her fervent thanks to that power that&#xD;
had shielded her from outrage worse than&#xD;
death.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE scene we are now about to de-&#xD;
scribe was in a room of a hotel; the&#xD;
time, five o'clock in the morning-the per-&#xD;
sons present were Belcher Kay, Maretzo,&#xD;
and two or three other noisy and dissi-&#xD;
pated revellers, whose flushedscounten-&#xD;
ances, blood-shot eyes, and other equally&#xD;
striking  symptoms, showed    plainly&#xD;
enough that they had been 'making a&#xD;
night of it.'&#xD;
Kay and the Italian appeared to be&#xD;
the most sober of the company, not that&#xD;
their potations had been less deep or fre-&#xD;
quent than their companions, but that&#xD;
constant practice had so inured them to&#xD;
the wine cup, that it was long ere they&#xD;
showed any ill-effects from it.&#xD;
They certainly were particularly noisy&#xD;
and merry, and their companions lent&#xD;
their aid to the conviviality, by knocking&#xD;
down everything the aforesaid said or&#xD;
did, in the most tumultuous manner.&#xD;
One individual, in the classic language&#xD;
of the drunkard, was ' quite done up,'&#xD;
and was stretched at full length upon the&#xD;
floor, under one of tables, with his hat&#xD;
for a pillow, and a portion of the carpet&#xD;
for a coverlid ; and every now and then&#xD;
he added to the general tumult by a&#xD;
loud snore of the most hoggish descrip-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The proprietor of the hotel had seve-&#xD;

&#xD;
ral times requested the party to break up,&#xD;
but as the said party threatened to break&#xD;
his head instead, if he interfered with&#xD;
them, he thought it was best to desist&#xD;
from his importunities, and after supply-&#xD;
ing them with enough wine for the nigh,&#xD;
he retired to his own chamber, and left&#xD;
them, very reluctantly, to the indulgence&#xD;
of their noisy revels.&#xD;
At the time we have thought proper&#xD;
to open this scene, it was, as we have be-&#xD;
fore stated, about five o'clock in the&#xD;
morning, and the landlord of the hotel&#xD;
had arisen, and his servants also, and the&#xD;
usual bustle in such places prevailed, but&#xD;
still the debauchees continued their riot-&#xD;
ous mirth, and it appeared as if they had&#xD;
fully made up their minds to make ano-&#xD;
ther day of it, at least.&#xD;
'The song, Kay,. the song, the song;&#xD;
we will have no excuses;' shouted Ma-&#xD;
retzo.&#xD;
'Ay, ay, the song, the song, we will&#xD;
have no excuses;' chorussed three or four&#xD;
voices, and the man under the table gave&#xD;
a loud snore.&#xD;
'Oh, the song, ahi! well I don't mind&#xD;
trying one, just to keep up the convivi-&#xD;
ality ;' said Kay, who was seated on ra-&#xD;
ther a high chair, with his legsnegligent.&#xD;
ly deposited on one end of the table, and&#xD;
twiddling a fine-flavoured cigar in his&#xD;
finger and thumb. ' The song.-let me&#xD;
see--ah, what shall it be? Oh, I have&#xD;
it-very good I think you will admit.'&#xD;
And-then without any further ceremo-&#xD;
ny, Kay, who had an excellent voice&#xD;
commenced singing.&#xD;
The demonstrations of applause that&#xD;
greeted this bacehanallian display, were&#xD;
of, the most uproarious kind, and by the&#xD;
time the companions of Maretzo and&#xD;
Kayhad given full scope to the exuber-&#xD;
of their delight and approbation,&#xD;
&#xD;
they were one and all ' done up,' and&#xD;
one by one dropped off to sleep, leaving&#xD;
the two above-named gentlemen to the&#xD;
uninterrupted enjoyment of their owa&#xD;
society.&#xD;
'Ha ! ha ! ha!' ,laughed Maretzo ;&#xD;
' they are regularly floored, poor de-&#xD;
vils !'&#xD;
'Completely finished and done up,&#xD;
coincided Kay ;-'ha! ha! ha!'&#xD;
'They are not half fellows to be done&#xD;
up with one night's carouse, poor devils&#xD;
ha! ha ! ha!1' observed Maretzo.&#xD;
' Poor weak creatures to be knocked&#xD;
down with a dozen or two of wine;, ha!I&#xD;
ha ! ha!' again laughed Kay.&#xD;
'Not- like you and I, Kay;' added&#xD;
Maretzo.&#xD;
' Not a bit of it.'&#xD;
'No comparison.'&#xD;
'A loco-foce to the moon.'&#xD;
'Half a pint of beer to a pipe of&#xD;
wine.'&#xD;
'They cannot stand anything'&#xD;
'Positively nothing!'&#xD;
'They're twaddlers l'&#xD;
' Drivellers'!'&#xD;
'Noodles!'&#xD;
'Boobies '&#xD;
'Nincompoops!'&#xD;
'Humbugs!'&#xD;
It may be as well to observe here that&#xD;
these compliments were bestowed upon.&#xD;
the party at large, who had been liberal.&#xD;
ly carousing Maretzo and Kay, without&#xD;
expecting the latter to pay a cent of the&#xD;
reckoning, and consequently they may-&#xD;
be considered fully entitled to the elegant&#xD;
epithets that were lavishly bestowed upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
'You, and. I are the fellows to do it,-&#xD;
Maretzo,', said Kay.&#xD;
'Positively the very fellows," coincided&#xD;
his friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
' We are no skulkers while there is&#xD;
plenty of good wine before us." added&#xD;
Kay.&#xD;
' Never think of such a thing."&#xD;
' It would ruin our reputation, if we&#xD;
were known to do such a thing.'&#xD;
'And that would be a most melancho-&#xD;
ly thing.'&#xD;
'Positively awful!1'&#xD;
' We will never let the enemy beat&#xD;
us.'&#xD;
' No, d-n 1' returned Spangle;-' but&#xD;
down with it, down with it, and at it&#xD;
again.'&#xD;
'At it again !Hah ! hal ha!'&#xD;
'We are wine proof !'&#xD;
'Full proof?1'&#xD;
' Above proof, by- '&#xD;
'But talking about women,' observed&#xD;
Kay, ' That Blodget was a devilish for-&#xD;
tunate fellow.'&#xD;
'Cunning rogue !' replied Maretzo ;&#xD;
'he managed his business famously, and&#xD;
has contrived admirably to elude the vigi-&#xD;
lance of Monteagle and the lady's friends.'&#xD;
'They have not heard anything of&#xD;
them yet, I believe'&#xD;
'Nothing!'&#xD;
' Poor Monteagle ! Ha I ha!'&#xD;
' Ah ! poor fool!'&#xD;
' I wonder what has become of Mont-&#xD;
eagle ?'&#xD;
' Oh, he is doubtless still making every&#xD;
inquiry after the lady.'&#xD;
'And it is my firm belief that Inez&#xD;
will never live to see her father, her lov-&#xD;
er, or her friends again.'&#xD;
'I am of the same opinion; a sensi-&#xD;
tive, high-minded woman like her, will&#xD;
never be able to survive long the misery&#xD;
and degradation which Blodget has&#xD;
heaped upon her.'&#xD;
'He positively must be a smart scoun-&#xD;
drel.'&#xD;
&#xD;
' I never heard of one equal to him.'&#xD;
' Such a systematic way as he went to&#xD;
work to accomplish his villainy.'&#xD;
' The ingenious and .complicated plot&#xD;
he devised to bring about the gratifica-&#xD;
tion of his wishes.'&#xD;
' The artful manner in which he con-&#xD;
rived to make the simpleton, Jenkins,&#xD;
his dupe, too ; the ready tool to further&#xD;
his deep-la d stratagem.'&#xD;
' He must have had his education in&#xD;
the school of art and vice, certainly.'&#xD;
'Yes, and been a ready pupil, too.'&#xD;
'But is it not strange that every strat-&#xD;
agem has failed to find the slightest clue&#xD;
to the place of retreat?'&#xD;
' Wonderful 1'&#xD;
'And then the attempt upon Mont-&#xD;
eagle's life.'&#xD;
' Doubtless by some ruffian employed&#xD;
by him.'&#xD;
'There cannot be a doubt of it.'&#xD;
' To be sure. Revenge has incited him&#xD;
to it.'&#xD;
' He is a dangerous fellow to offend.'&#xD;
' A very devil.'&#xD;
' At any rate, he does not fail to play&#xD;
the very devil with those who excite his&#xD;
enmity.&#xD;
' True'&#xD;
'But he must be defeated at last.'&#xD;
' Certainly there is not much prospect&#xD;
of it at present.'&#xD;
' Oh, no doubt he will be caught in&#xD;
some of his own snares by and bye.'&#xD;
'But do you think he has ruined the&#xD;
girlP&#xD;
' He is villain enough for anything.'&#xD;
' He must be a monster, indeed, if he&#xD;
could perpetrate such a crime as that. I&#xD;
must have another glass of wine.&#xD;
'Do you think that he who did not&#xD;
hesitate to attempt the life of the father,&#xD;

and the violation of the daughter, would&#xD;
shrink from any thing.'&#xD;
'But, then, her youth-her innocence.'&#xD;
'Paha !'-he is a stranger to such feel-&#xD;
ings as they ought to inspire.'&#xD;
' Why, to be sure, from  his general&#xD;
conduct, we have an undoubted right to&#xD;
suppose that he is.'&#xD;
' And yet I think that he has had&#xD;
some other motive for getting the girl in&#xD;
his power ; that he has found her neces-&#xD;
sary to advance hit base schemes.'&#xD;
There was a pause.,&#xD;
' But that Blodget is really a most ter-&#xD;
rible fellow,' said Kay.&#xD;
' Every stratagem, every scheme 'of&#xD;
rascality, I do believe, that that rascal of&#xD;
rascals is up to.&#xD;
'Positively every scheme,' said Maret-&#xD;
zo,' ' but this is a dry subject, and I must&#xD;
have another glass of wine.'&#xD;
' I feel to want one myself, too,' ob-&#xD;
served Kay, filling his glass from the de-&#xD;
canter : ' Well, here's wishing that Blod-&#xD;
get may soon be here.'&#xD;
'And Inez restored to her lover and&#xD;
friends,' exclaimed Maretzo.&#xD;
'Quite safe.'&#xD;
'Quite safe,' repeated Kay.&#xD;
'And yet I am afraid there is not&#xD;
much chance of that.'&#xD;
'Nor I.'&#xD;
'Leave that consummate scoundrel,&#xD;
Blodget, alone for that.'&#xD;
'Ay, ay.'&#xD;
'He would not fail to enforce his&#xD;
wishes.'&#xD;
s To be sure he would not.'&#xD;
'And what resistance could she make?1'&#xD;
'None at all.'&#xD;
'She is so completely in his power.'&#xD;
' Completely.'&#xD;
'Without a friend at hand to fly to her&#xD;
rescue.'&#xD;
&#xD;
' Not a friend ; and besides no one&#xD;
knows, or can form the least conjecture&#xD;
whither he has taken her.'&#xD;
' Not the least shadow of an idea,'said&#xD;
Kay.&#xD;
' Any person would positively imagine&#xD;
that the fellow had some dealings with&#xD;
the devil,' added Maretzo, ' and that she&#xD;
was conveyed away by magic.'&#xD;
'That they certainly would, observed&#xD;
Kay.&#xD;
'I would not mind a hundred dollars&#xD;
to know where the fellow is.'&#xD;
' Why, that would be rather awkward,&#xD;
I imagine, Maretzo,' returned Kay, with&#xD;
an expressive grin.&#xD;
' Ha ! ha l laughed Maretzo, clapping&#xD;
his hand significantly to his pocket; 'fi-&#xD;
nances rather queer, you think ? Ha !&#xD;
ha ! ha I I understand!'&#xD;
' Funds low.'&#xD;
'Ha! ha ! ha!I'&#xD;
'It is not a very laughable matter&#xD;
though.'&#xD;
' Very unpleasant.'&#xD;
'To be staightened for a few hun-&#xD;
dreds"&#xD;
' Very disagreeable.'&#xD;
' And. people have no faith in the&#xD;
word and honor of gentlemen, now-a-&#xD;
days.&#xD;
'Bnt we must do something to raise&#xD;
the wind.'&#xD;
'That is very evident.'&#xD;
' Quite certain.'&#xD;
'Quite.'&#xD;
' We must make good use of these&#xD;
boobies,' said Kay.'&#xD;
' To be sure. Leave us alone for that,'&#xD;
replied Maretzo.&#xD;
'Oh, yes, I am certain of that.'&#xD;
' They are very easy.'&#xD;
'Poor devils.'&#xD;
'Fit sport for us'&#xD;

&#xD;
' Just the sort of game we like to&#xD;
hunt,' returned Maretzo.&#xD;
' They have got a few thousands, which&#xD;
they seem bent upon wasting.'&#xD;
' And we might as well reap the bene-&#xD;
fit'as any other persons.'&#xD;
' To be sure.'&#xD;
' And we will too.'&#xD;
' Oh, there is not the least doubt of&#xD;
that; ha! ha! ha!'&#xD;
'By the by, we ought not to feel much&#xD;
obliged to Blodget for that affair --'&#xD;
'No, that was a d--d bore.'&#xD;
'Remarkably unpleasant.'&#xD;
'A few hundreds out of our way.'&#xD;
' Yes.'&#xD;
' We have mingled in some strange&#xD;
scenes together.'&#xD;
'You may say that.'&#xD;
' We have been in luck together.'&#xD;
'In debt together.'&#xD;
'In prison together.'&#xD;
'Damme ! we have shared all the&#xD;
smiles and frowns of fortune, and may&#xD;
we soon be on more friendly terms with&#xD;

'Bravo V&#xD;
The two friends quaffed off glass after&#xD;
glass, with as much gusto as if they had&#xD;
only just, commenced a night's carouse;&#xD;
and then each crossing their legs in an&#xD;
indolent and careless manner, remained&#xD;
silent'for a short time. The sleepers were&#xD;
snoring in concert, and did not seem&#xD;
likely to awake for some time, but to mo-&#xD;
nopolize the coffee-room for a chamber,&#xD;
for that day at least.&#xD;
After the lapse of a short interval,&#xD;
Maretzo lookedup with an expression of&#xD;
countenance, half solemn, and half hu-&#xD;
morous, and, addressing himself to Kay,&#xD;
say :&#xD;
'Kay, my boy !'      -s&#xD;
'Well, my dear fellow,' said Kay.&#xD;
&#xD;
'I have-rbeen thinking, Kay.'&#xD;
'And what have you been thinking !'&#xD;
interrogated his dissipated companion.&#xD;
' Why, that we have been a pair of&#xD;
d-d scoundrels!'&#xD;
'Ha ! ha ! ha! what a discovery I-&#xD;
why, I have known and felt that long&#xD;
ago, Maretzo,' returned Kay.&#xD;
'We have taken that which did not&#xD;
belong to us!' added Maretzo, ' and bor-&#xD;
rowed that which we never repaid.'&#xD;
' And never meant to repay ;' observed&#xD;
Kay, with a laugh.&#xD;
' We have diddled our tailor ; broken&#xD;
the fortunes, and the hearts of innumer-&#xD;
able bootmakers, hatters, frizzeurs, laun-&#xD;
dresses, and other creditors.'&#xD;
'Very true,' remarked Kay, 'and we&#xD;
are likely enough to break the hearts of&#xD;
a great many more, if they are silly&#xD;
enough to trust us.'&#xD;
' Ah 1' ejaculated Maretzo, and he fetch-&#xD;
ed a very deep sigh, reflectively.&#xD;
' Ah l' mimicked Kay; ' why, confound&#xD;
me, if you are not getting melancholy.'&#xD;
' I am becoming penitent,' replied Mar-&#xD;
etzo, in a tone still half serious, ' I am&#xD;
becoming penitent, Kay,'&#xD;
'Penitent!'&#xD;
'Yes, downright compunctious.'&#xD;
'Ha I ha! ha '&#xD;
' Don't laugh, I feel a touch of the se-&#xD;
rious,' remarked Maretzo, ' I think it is&#xD;
high time that we began to think about&#xD;
a reformation, Kay.'&#xD;
'Well, positively.'&#xD;
'Ah ! it may be well, positively,' re-&#xD;
peated Maretzo, ' and, positively, I wish&#xD;
it to be well.'&#xD;
' And what is your plan of reforma-&#xD;
tion ?' inquired Kay.&#xD;
' Why, matrimony.'&#xD;
'Matrimony              -&#xD;
' Ay, sober wedlock,' answered Maret-&#xD;

so, 'it would be advisibie for us to do the&#xD;
steady and the amiable for some time,&#xD;
until we can meet with a favorable match;&#xD;
a handsome sum in the shape of a- wed-&#xD;
ding dowry, and a handsome wife, and&#xD;
then we may settle down into two worthy,&#xD;
gentlemen, very patterns of domesticated&#xD;
virtue.'&#xD;
'Not a bad plan,' said Kay,: smiling,&#xD;
'but it is almost too soon to think about&#xD;
that, yet.'&#xD;
'Not at all.'&#xD;
' That is only your opinion,'&#xD;
'And I have no doubt, as we have&#xD;
hitherto generally agreed, that it will be&#xD;
your opinion also.'.&#xD;
'I cannot make up my mind to be&#xD;
shackled jfst yet, my dear fellow,' replied&#xD;
Kay.r&#xD;
'Nonsense, you may let the opportu-&#xD;
nity go by, and then you would repent&#xD;
it, take my word for it,'&#xD;
'Probably, I might,' said Kay, ' but I&#xD;
hall e'en trust fortune a little while&#xD;
longer.'&#xD;
'But fortune will not trust you-we&#xD;
owe her too large an account already,'&#xD;
observedMaretzo.,&#xD;
'But I am determined to jilt the jade&#xD;
still further, yet.'&#xD;
Mind you do not deceive yourself.'&#xD;
Leave mpe alone for that.'&#xD;
'After all, if a pretty gird; with a-hand-&#xD;
some potion is thrown in your way, I do&#xD;
not fear but that I shall be able to make&#xD;
you a convert.'&#xD;
'Well, -we'll leave that till the oppor-&#xD;
tunityloffexs itself.' ;&#xD;
Be it so.'&#xD;
But you are really serious?'&#xD;
' Cursed serious.'&#xD;
Ha, ha, ha 1 we must have another&#xD;
glass of wine after that,' laughed Kay,&#xD;
'here's fortune and' matrimony.'&#xD;
&#xD;
- Fortune and matrimony,' responded&#xD;
Maretzo, raising the glass to his lips; and&#xD;
then another pause of a few minutes took&#xD;
place.&#xD;
'I have been thinking, Kay,' at length&#xD;
Maretzo broke silence, ' that, after all,&#xD;
the whereabouts of Blodget, and Inez&#xD;
may not be so difficult for Monteagle to&#xD;
trace out as hitherto it has proved.'&#xD;
At this, the door opened, and. the&#xD;
landlord entered, saying that a man&#xD;
wished to speak to Kay.&#xD;
'Tell him to come in. Who the deuce&#xD;
can it be ?' said Kay..&#xD;
'Doubtless one of our fellows,' said&#xD;
Maretzo.&#xD;
The man now entered.&#xD;
' Well,' said Kay. ' ' I'm the person&#xD;
you asked for.'&#xD;
The visitor went to the door, and turn-&#xD;
ed the key. He then said, in a low&#xD;
tone, ' Is your companion to be trusted I'&#xD;
'True as steel,' said Kay..&#xD;
']3lodget is in trouble and needs your&#xD;
assistance. He is at Gordon's house.-&#xD;
Jenkins has informed on him, and he&#xD;
can't leave the house without almost cer-&#xD;
tain death. He wishes you and a per-&#xD;
son he called Maretzo, to be there to-&#xD;
night. With your aid he can get off,&#xD;
carrying the lady with him. He says&#xD;
he won't mind a couple of thousand, if&#xD;
you can get him out of this scrape'&#xD;
'Now, my good fellow, how do we&#xD;
know that this isn't all gas. A trap,&#xD;
may be ?' said Kay.&#xD;
'He told me to tell you, if you doubt-&#xD;
ed me, to remember the old man in the&#xD;
old house!'&#xD;
Kay started, but quickly recovering&#xD;
himself said, 'I All right, we'll be on&#xD;
hand.'&#xD;
The man left the house, and mounting&#xD;
his horse rode to the Mission. At a&#xD;
&#xD;
small house near the church he found&#xD;
Joaquin, by whom he was conducted to&#xD;
Jenkins, who was in company with&#xD;
Monteagle and some Californians, friends&#xD;
of Inez and her family.&#xD;
The party speedily set off across the&#xD;
country towards the 'house where Inez&#xD;
was confined. But speedy as they were,&#xD;
they found they had been anticipated by&#xD;
Kay and Maretzo, who had set off to&#xD;
aid Blodget the instant the man had&#xD;
left. On arriving at the house they&#xD;
knocked boldly at the door. Gordon&#xD;
opened it, but upon seeing who the visi-&#xD;
tors were he attempted-to slam  it in&#xD;
their faces, but ere he succeeded a long&#xD;
Spanish knife was driven to his heart by&#xD;
Maretzo, and the wretch fell a bleeding&#xD;
corpse on the floor. Blodget was soon&#xD;
released.&#xD;
' Bear a-hand,' cried Kay, 'We must&#xD;
be out of this d-d quick. If Jenkins&#xD;
or any of his gang arrive, we're gone&#xD;
chickens.'&#xD;
'One moment,' cried Blodget. 'I'll&#xD;
have this d---d stubborn Spanish b-h&#xD;
if I have to carry her corpse across my&#xD;
saddle' as he spoke he sprang up stairs.&#xD;
Alice had overheard what passed for&#xD;
she was sitting by Inez's bed-side watch-&#xD;
ing her slumbers.&#xD;
The brave girl instantly determined to&#xD;
save Inez, even at peril of her own life.&#xD;
She extinguished the light, and throw-&#xD;
ing the veil of Inez over her head, and&#xD;
her mantle over her shoulders, she stood&#xD;
with beating heart, as she heard the vil-&#xD;
lain Blodget's steps upon the stairs.&#xD;
' Inezl' cried the ruffian, as he opened&#xD;
the door of the chamber.&#xD;
'Who calls me,' said Alice, imitating&#xD;
the voice of Inez.&#xD;
The rufilan made no reply, but seizing&#xD;

her shrinking form in his arms, he bore&#xD;
her to the front of the ranch, where Kay&#xD;
and Maretzo stood ready to mount, hold-&#xD;
ing a spare horse that they had brought&#xD;
to facilitate Blodget's escape. The ruf-&#xD;
fian sprang to his horse's back, dragging&#xD;
Alice up before, and dashing the rowels&#xD;
into his horse's flanks, flew off at full&#xD;
speed, followed by Kay and Maretzo.&#xD;
They had not been gone many mo-&#xD;
ments, ere Jenkins, Monteagle, and their&#xD;
friends arrived. The bloody body of&#xD;
Gordon, which first arrested their atten-&#xD;
tion at the threshold, filled them with&#xD;
dreadful forebodings.&#xD;
Lights were procured, and Monteagle&#xD;
sought the chamber in which he was&#xD;
told he would find Inez. He burst in-&#xD;
to the room. A lady lay on the bed.&#xD;
'Inez l' he shouted.&#xD;
The lady turned her head, and his&#xD;
eyes fell upon her countenance !&#xD;
' Gracious Heaven!' he almost shriek-&#xD;
ed ; 'is this some beauteous vision got&#xD;
up to torture me to madnessI Inez!-&#xD;
My Inez?&#xD;
A wild shriek answered him !-It was&#xD;
no delusion ! He sprang forward with&#xD;
delirious speed, just time enough to clasp&#xD;
the fainting form of his long-lost betroth-&#xD;
ed in his arms!&#xD;
How shall our weak pen essay the&#xD;
task to describe the scene which followed&#xD;
this strange, this unexpected meeting I&#xD;
Insensible, Inez was conveyed to an&#xD;
apartment in the cabaret, whither Mont-&#xD;
eagle followed, and could not be persuad-&#xD;
ed to leave her sight for an instant.&#xD;
Again and again he enfolded her in&#xD;
his arms; pressed warm kisses on her&#xD;
lips, her cheeks, her teinples, and laugh-&#xD;
ed and wept like a child, by turns!--&#xD;
Then he threw himself upon his knees'&#xD;

clasps his hands vehemently together,&#xD;
and poured forth an eloquent prayer to-&#xD;
the most-High !&#xD;
Joaquin began to entertain a fear that&#xD;
the sudden surprise, and so powerful a&#xD;
shock as it must be to his feelings, would&#xD;
have a fatal effect upon his senses; and&#xD;
he did all that he -possibly could to&#xD;
calm his emotions.&#xD;
His efforts were, however, for some&#xD;
time unavailing, but at length he be,-&#xD;
eame more tranqillized, and resigning&#xD;
Inez to the care of the persons who had&#xD;
been called in to attend her, he sank in-&#xD;
to a chair, and covering his face with&#xD;
his hands, gave full vent to the emotions&#xD;
that overflowed his heart, in a copious&#xD;
flood of tears.&#xD;
' Joaquin in this did not attempt to in-&#xD;
terrupt him, for he well knew what a re-&#xD;
lief it would be to him, and he turned&#xD;
his eyes from Monteagle to watch the&#xD;
progress which was being made towards&#xD;
the recovery of Inez.&#xD;
His joy was scarcely less than that of&#xD;
Monteagle, alhough it did not exhibit it-&#xD;
self in so violent a manner, and his heart&#xD;
teemed with gratitude to the Almighty,&#xD;
who had brought about their restoration&#xD;
to each other in so miraculous a manner.&#xD;
It was not long before Ines was re-&#xD;
stored to animation; and, looking eager-&#xD;
ly around her, she exclaimed :-&#xD;
- 'Where is he ?-Was it a dream ?-&#xD;
Oh, where is Monteagle ?'&#xD;
He is here, my love, my long lost&#xD;
one l-My only hope!' cried Monteagle,&#xD;
and again they- were enfolded to each&#xD;
other's hearts, while further utterance&#xD;
was denied them by the power of their&#xD;
emotions !&#xD;

language of ours, however powerful, we&#xD;
could describe it !&#xD;
Those moments were a foretaste of&#xD;
Heaven, succeeding the torment of pur-&#xD;
gatory ! Their extacy was so great, that&#xD;
they could scarcely believe the evidence&#xD;
of their senses. It was some time ere&#xD;
they could satisfy themselves that they&#xD;
spoke, they breathed, or' that they&#xD;
were still inhabitants of this sublunary&#xD;
scene !&#xD;
But when, by the joint efforts of&#xD;
Joaquin and others, they became more&#xD;
tranquillized, the scene which followed&#xD;
was affecting in the extreme. They rest-&#xD;
ed for a few hours, as they were not suf-&#xD;
ficiently composed to resume their jour-&#xD;
ner to that home in which they had not&#xD;
together met for so lorg a period, and&#xD;
where they had never expected to meet&#xD;
again ; and their friends, after a short&#xD;
time, left them to themselves, to enter&#xD;
into that mutual explanation, they were&#xD;
each so anxious to obtain.&#xD;
With what feelings of horror, disgust,&#xD;
and indignation, did Monteagle listen to&#xD;
the recital of his love, but how did his&#xD;
heart overflow with gratitude, when he&#xD;
heard of the manner in which Inez had&#xD;
been enabled to resist the diabolical at-&#xD;
tempts and importunities of the villain&#xD;
Blodget ; and as he pressed her to his&#xD;
heart, he again pouredl forth his thanks&#xD;
to the Almighty for her preservation from&#xD;
such accumulated and fearful dangers.&#xD;
' The monster ! the fiend !-for he&#xD;
cannot be anything human, although he&#xD;
bears the form ofman,' cried Monteagle,&#xD;
speaking of Blodget ; 'oh, how I regret&#xD;
that he has been suffered to escape my&#xD;
vengeance l'&#xD;
'But he will not that of Heaven,&#xD;
dearest,' ejaculated Inez ; ' oh, most as-&#xD;
suredly that will ere long overtake him&#xD;

in its most terrible form, for the many,&#xD;
the almost- unequalled crimes of which&#xD;
he has been guilty l'&#xD;
'True, my love,' returned Monteagle,&#xD;
and his eyes sparkled with rapture as he&#xD;
gazed upon that dear countenance he&#xD;
had never expected to behold again;&#xD;
'and oh, if ever atrocity deserved pun-&#xD;
ishment, dreadful will be his doom. To&#xD;
concoct so infernal a plot, by which he&#xD;
,tore you from my arms.'&#xD;
Inez smiled beautifully through her&#xD;
tears, and throwing her fair ys around&#xD;
the neck of Monteagle, the kisses she so&#xD;
fervently pressed upon his lips, convinced&#xD;
him powerfully of her affection.&#xD;
' Say no more upon that painful sub-&#xD;
ject, my dearest,' she ejaculated ; 'let it&#xD;
from this joyful moment be for ever bu-&#xD;
ried in oblivion.'&#xD;
'It shall, it shall, my sweetest,' replied&#xD;
Monteagle ; ' but oh, what a debt of gra-&#xD;
titude do I owe to your generous pre-&#xD;
server, Jenkins. Would that I could see&#xD;
him, that I might to himself express&#xD;
the power of my feelings. Nothing can&#xD;
ever sufficiently reward that man for&#xD;
the inestimable service he has rendered&#xD;
me.'&#xD;
'I need not assure you,' rejoined Inez,&#xD;
'that I most warmly concur in your feel-&#xD;
ings; and I trust that at some future&#xD;
period, Jenkins may be able to visit us,&#xD;
and receive the demonstrations of our&#xD;
mutual gratitude, and, moreover, be per-&#xD;
suaded to quit the life he is at present&#xD;
leading.'&#xD;
' Pity it is that he should, by some&#xD;
cursed fatality urging him on to crime,&#xD;
be driven from it,' observed Monteagle ;&#xD;
'but I dare say that his offences have&#xD;
never been so heinous as to exclude him&#xD;
from all hope of earthly pardon.'&#xD;
'No, I cannot believe that they have,'&#xD;
&#xD;
replied Inez ; ' but he is so much' at-&#xD;
tached to his present wild life of freedom,&#xD;
and his reckless associates, that I am&#xD;
doubtful whether he will ever be induced&#xD;
to abandon them.'&#xD;
'My influence and exertions to induce&#xD;
him to do so, shall not be wanting,' said&#xD;
Monteagle.  'Still I am sorry that he&#xD;
should have changed his first determin-&#xD;
ation, namely, to deliver the wretch&#xD;
Blodget into the hands of justice. While&#xD;
I know that vllain to living and still at&#xD;
large, my mind cannot be entirely at rest,&#xD;
for, however watchful and vigilant we&#xD;
may be, after what we have experienced&#xD;
from his villanous artifices, have we not&#xD;
reason to fear that he will devise some&#xD;
means of further annoying us, and grati-&#xD;
fying his demonical revenge?'&#xD;
'Do not, I beg of you, my love,' said&#xD;
our heroine, ' harass your mind by ap-&#xD;
prehensione.'&#xD;
'Heaven grant that your surmises&#xD;
may prove correct, Inez,' observed Mont-&#xD;
eagle ; ' but I candidly own that I can-&#xD;
not entirely divest my mind of the fears&#xD;
which I have described; and should any-&#xD;
thing happen again to you, my love, all&#xD;
my manly fortitude would entirely for-&#xD;
sake me, and I should never be able to&#xD;
survive the shock !'&#xD;
'Pray, Monteagle,' urged Inez, 'if you&#xD;
would not make me miserable, endeav-&#xD;
or, struggle to banish such gloomy im-&#xD;
aginings from your bosom. and trust to&#xD;
the goodness of Providence which has&#xD;
hitherto so mercifully preserved us, when&#xD;
the darkest snares of villainy sought to&#xD;
ruin and destroy us.'&#xD;
'For your sake, my own love,' replied&#xD;
Monteagle, once more affectionately and&#xD;
passionately kissing her cheek, ' I will&#xD;
endeavor to do so ; still you surely will&#xD;
not blame me for not placing too much&#xD;

'Oh, no,' in that you will only act&#xD;
with prudence and wisdom, although, I&#xD;
must repeat that I sincerely trust there&#xD;
will not be found to be any necessity for&#xD;
that precaution. But my poor father---&#xD;

Joaquin, however, roused him from his&#xD;

' Totally deranged!1 Then his mind&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
The Seducer's Terrible End.&#xD;
A FEw nights after Blodget's escape&#xD;
found him walking the streets of San&#xD;
Francisco, but disguised as he thought&#xD;
too effectually to be recognised by any&#xD;
eye, however sharp.&#xD;
There was a. cloud upon Blodget's&#xD;
brow as he emerged from the court&#xD;
into the semi-obscurity of Montgomery&#xD;
street, and his mind was evidently ill at&#xD;
ease. He tried to hum a fashionable&#xD;
opera air when he had walked a little&#xD;
distance, but there seemed something&#xD;
in his throat which choked him, and&#xD;
the sounds died tpon his lips. Then&#xD;
he quickened his pace, when a young&#xD;
female emerged from a street which he&#xD;
was passing, and laid her hand upon&#xD;
his arm. He turned his head, and be-&#xD;
held Carlotta.&#xD;
She was thinner than when he had&#xD;
seen her last, and looked as if she had&#xD;
recently been ill; but her dark eyes&#xD;
were as lustrous as then, and there was&#xD;
the same gloss upon her raven hair.&#xD;
At the moment that she emerged from&#xD;
the shade of the court, and laid her hand&#xD;
upon his, there was a strange and al-&#xD;
most indescribable expression upon he&#xD;
dark countenance, but it passed away&#xD;
as quickly as a flight of birds-over a&#xD;
stream, and when Blodget's eyes met&#xD;
hers, they read nothing therein but&#xD;
pleasure at meeting him again.&#xD;
'Ah, my little wild rose of the is-&#xD;
lands 1' said he, 'what are you doing at&#xD;
&#xD;
pretty wild birds should be in their&#xD;
nests.&#xD;
'Well, I can't say I was looking for&#xD;
you,' returned Carlotta, 'but I am glad&#xD;
that I have met you, nevertheless. But&#xD;
I should ask you where you have been&#xD;
wandering, you naughty man ?'&#xD;
' Oh, I have been to the theatre, and&#xD;
then walked this way with a friend,'&#xD;
returned Blodget. 'But where are you&#xD;
staying-can you take me home with&#xD;
you?'&#xD;
'Fiei1' said Carlotta, playfully.&#xD;
' I really cannot part with you, my&#xD;
charnmer,' said Blodget. 'If you cannot&#xD;
take me to your quarters, wherever they&#xD;
may be, you must come somewhere&#xD;
with me.'&#xD;
'You must not think of going where&#xD;
my people are,' observed the Chilian&#xD;
girl, 'remember how near the detection&#xD;
of our amour was costing our lives.'&#xD;
'Then come with me, my beauty,&#xD;
said Blodget. 'There is a house not&#xD;
far from here which will suit out pur-&#xD;
pose, and I shall not part with you until&#xD;
day-light.'&#xD;
'Then I go with you, Blodget,' said&#xD;
Carlotta. 'Promise me that you will&#xD;
not seek to detain me more than an&#xD;
hour, and I will not refuse you the hap-&#xD;
piness you covet.'&#xD;
Blodget promised, and the Chiliaa&#xD;
girl accompanied him to an accommoda-&#xD;
tion-house in the neighborhood, where&#xD;
they were conducted to a neatly furnish-&#xD;
ed bed-chamber on the first floor.&#xD;
' We shall have time to drink a bottle&#xD;
of champagne in the hour that you have&#xD;
promised to remain with me,' observed&#xD;
Blodget, and he gave the girl, who had&#xD;
preceded them with a light, some ail-&#xD;

&#xD;
They sat down, and Blodget threw&#xD;
his arm round the waist of his dark-&#xD;
eyed companion, and drawing her to-&#xD;
wards him, impressed a kiss upon her&#xD;
lips. She smiled upon him, but her&#xD;
lips did not give back the kiss, and&#xD;
theme.-'was a glitter in her night dark&#xD;
eyes at the moment which was not the&#xD;
radiance which springs from happiness&#xD;
or love. Blodget, however, failed to de-'&#xD;
tect anything unusual or peculiar in the&#xD;
expression of that glance. The- wine&#xD;
was brought, and placed upon a. small&#xD;
round table convenient to Blodget's&#xD;
hand, and he filled the glasses, handing&#xD;
one to Carlotta and taking one himself.&#xD;
'The sparkling juice will bring back&#xD;
to your dark cheeks a glow that seems&#xD;
wanting there.' said he, as he sat down&#xD;
the glasses and immediately refilled&#xD;
them.&#xD;
' Come, drink,' he cried.&#xD;
'It will be the last time we'll drink&#xD;
together.'    .&#xD;
'Why what the deuce makes you&#xD;
think so ?' said Blodget.&#xD;
'I don't know,' replied the 'girl,&#xD;
'but I h'ave said it, and you'll see if it&#xD;
don't come to pass.'&#xD;
'D-d nonsense,' cried Blodget, laugh-&#xD;
ing, and then he drew his companion on&#xD;
his knee, and kissed her repeatedly and&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
Carlotta was silent, but she reclined&#xD;
her dark cheek against her seducer's,&#xD;
and quietly and adroitly drew from her&#xD;
pocket a little phial containing some&#xD;
liquid. Concealing the phial in her&#xD;
hand,'she then threw her arm over&#xD;
Blodget's shoulder, and noiselessly draw-&#xD;
ing the tiny'cork, poured the contents&#xD;
of the phial into his glass.&#xD;
'Another glass of champagne, my&#xD;
glow-worm,' said Blodget,'and the soft&#xD;
&#xD;
delights of -love, the thrilling joys of&#xD;
warm and impassioned nature are ours.'&#xD;
Carlotta removed her arm from his&#xD;
shoulder as he turned slightly to reach&#xD;
his wine, and while she kept her eyes&#xD;
upon the glasses to observe that he gave&#xD;
her the one that she had drank from be-&#xD;
fore, she returned the empty phial to&#xD;
hei pocket.&#xD;
'I suppose nothing unpleasant came&#xD;
of our dalliance ?' said Blodget, in a&#xD;
half interrogative tone, as he handed&#xD;
the girl her glass.&#xD;
' Why do you suppose so? Ought&#xD;
you not rather to suppose just the re-&#xD;
verse ? Was not something unpleasant&#xD;
naturally to be expected ?'&#xD;
'Well, perhaps I might have sup-&#xD;
posed so,' returned Blodget, deprecat-&#xD;
ingly, and a little disconcerted by the&#xD;
girl's reply.&#xD;
There was a moment's pause, and&#xD;
both sat with their glasses in their hands,&#xD;
Blodget's eyes fixed upon the floor, the&#xD;
girl surveying the countenance of her&#xD;
seducer, as if she were trying to read his&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
'Well, what was it?' Blodget at&#xD;
length inquired.,&#xD;
' A boy,' returned Carlotta. 'It died,&#xD;
and I was glad of it, for if it had lived&#xD;
it might have been as faithless as his&#xD;
father.'&#xD;
'Do you want to quarrel?'&#xD;
'No.'             I&#xD;
'For heaven's saks cease,' exclaimed&#xD;
Blodget, suddenly raising the wineglass&#xD;
to his lips, and emptying it at a draught.&#xD;
Carlotta drank her wine quickly as&#xD;
he spoke, and rose from his knee, where&#xD;
she had contrived to sit while upbraid-&#xD;
ing him with his inconstancy and du-&#xD;
plicity. Her dark eyes were fixed upon&#xD;
his countenance, which changed the mo-&#xD;

MYSTERIES AND MISERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
CARTER XX.&#xD;
The Return to the Mission.&#xD;
LET us now rejoin Inez and Monteagle&#xD;
whom we left on their road to the Mis-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
What powerful sensations of unspeak-&#xD;
able delight rushed through the vein% of&#xD;
Inez, and monopolized every feeling 'of&#xD;
her heart, when thosescenes which she&#xD;
had never expected to behold again,&#xD;
once more burst upon her vision. The&#xD;
tumult of rapturous and conflicting ideas&#xD;
that darted to her brain, were almost&#xD;
overwhelming, and, although her tongue&#xD;
was eager to. give expression to her sen-&#xD;
timents, the strength of her emotions&#xD;
would not permit her to give utterance&#xD;
to a single syllable. She looked in the&#xD;
countenance of her lover with an expres-&#xD;
sion of the most unbounded affection&#xD;
and delight, and she fully perceived that&#xD;
he reciprocated her feelings. Tears filled&#xD;
his eyes, and taking her hand he pressed&#xD;
it to his lips with eloquent silence. -&#xD;
Not the slightest change appeared to&#xD;
have taken place in everything upon&#xD;
which the eyes of our' heroine rested,&#xD;
since last she had gazed upon those well&#xD;
known scenes. The bright beams of a&#xD;
silvery moon were shining serenely upon&#xD;
every thing around, and a melancholy&#xD;
silence, so consonant with her own state&#xD;
of mind, prevailed. But, alas, she re-&#xD;
flected, what a change had taken place&#xD;
in the home of her childhood ! That&#xD;
home which had once abounded in every,&#xD;
happiness that the human mind could&#xD;
wish for, was now the abode of sorrow;,&#xD;
that fond parent, whose every joy and&#xD;
hope were centered in her, was a maniace&#xD;
&#xD;
and would be insensible to the felicity of&#xD;
her restoration to his arms.&#xD;
This last thought was too afflicting for&#xD;
endurance, and overcome by her emotion&#xD;
she leant her head upon the bosom of&#xD;
Monteagle, and burst into an hysterical&#xD;
flood of tears.&#xD;
In~ vain did Monteagle endeavor to&#xD;
tranquilize her feelings, he felt how pow-&#xD;
erful was the cause she had for sorrow,&#xD;
and the anguish he endured was scarcely&#xD;
less than her, own.&#xD;
Joaquin exerted himself to the utmost&#xD;
to calm the feelings of them both, and&#xD;
he at length succeeded.&#xD;
Monteagle, we should have mentioned&#xD;
before, had taken the precaution to send&#xD;
forward a person to the Mission, with a&#xD;
letter, making them  briefly acquainted&#xD;
with the fortunate meeting which bad'&#xD;
taken place between him and- our hero-&#xD;
ine, and of their coming, so that the sur-&#xD;
prise might not be too sudden for them;&#xD;
and they were, therefore, fully aware that&#xD;
they would exert themselves to the ut-&#xD;
most to meet 'the unexpected pleasure&#xD;
which awaited them ; the more espe-&#xD;
cially as the precarious and lamentable&#xD;
situation of Senor de Castro rendered the&#xD;
greatest care necessary.&#xD;
At length the elegant, but unostenta-&#xD;
tious, mansion, burst upon their vision,&#xD;
and Providence imbued the mind of Inez&#xD;
with a calm feeling of joy, which she&#xD;
had never experienced before. Every-&#xD;
thing seemed to dance before her eyes to&#xD;
welcome ~ her return to that once happy&#xD;
home, and the horses appeared to move'&#xD;
with the most tedious slowness, as they&#xD;
bantered along the road which led to the&#xD;
garden gates.&#xD;
They reached those gates; they were&#xD;
