WITHIN about a mile of the Greenbriar river, which&#xD;
flows near the town of Lewisburg, Virginia, in a&#xD;
beautiTul valley, between two spurs of the Alleghany&#xD;
Mountains, there stood an old mansion house, erected&#xD;
many years ago, by one Piercy Morley, a descendant of&#xD;
one of the best families in the West of England. - Piercy&#xD;
Morley was a younger son, who, disregarding the wishes&#xD;
of his family, who had selected the church as a profession&#xD;
in which, through political influence, his prospects could&#xD;
be better advanced than in any other way, threw, up the&#xD;
gown and emigrated to the then colony of Virginia, about&#xD;
the year 1762, and settled in the neighborhood we =have&#xD;
described.  He was prosperous, soon attaining a high&#xD;
social position, and was elected a member of the House&#xD;
of Burgesses. Heedless of family ties, and sympathizing-&#xD;
Warmly with the spirit of Independence which -led' to the&#xD;

&#xD;
TIhE UNION BOYS OF '61.       '7&#xD;
&#xD;
War of the Revolution, on the breaking out of hostilities;&#xD;
he. enthusiastically espoused the cause of the "Rebels,"&#xD;
and raising a regiment, composed of the very flower of&#xD;
his adopted state, he fought at its head, until the Inde-&#xD;
pendence of the Colonies was achieved, and then, return-&#xD;
ing to his plantation, lived for many years to enjoy the&#xD;
fruits of that Liberty, which he had contributed so much&#xD;
to gain. At his death his large estate, known as "The&#xD;
Elms," passed into the hands of his only son, William&#xD;
Morley, who inherited all the patriotism of his father,&#xD;
and, served his country as well in her councils, as his an-&#xD;
cestor had in the field. He had married ,at an early age,&#xD;
the fruit of his union being.a son and a daughter. The&#xD;
son died sighting under his country's flag, upon the&#xD;
bloody field of Resaca de la Palma, and as the mother&#xD;
had, died some years previous, William Morley was left&#xD;
alone with his remaining child, Rose Morley, who, at the&#xD;
time we are writing of, was a beautiful girl about eighteen&#xD;
years of age.&#xD;
In the neighborhood of "The Elms," there resided at&#xD;
the same time, another family by the name of loughton.&#xD;
They were wealthy, but there were dark whispers afloat&#xD;
as to the manner in which old Ralph Houghton had ae-&#xD;
quired his wealth. He came from Louisiana, and had&#xD;
been a seafaring man up to the time of settling upon the&#xD;
estate he had purchased in South-Western Virginia, and&#xD;
had been, according to the declaration of some, engaged&#xD;
at one period of his life, in the slave trade, and the more&#xD;
censorious of the country gossips, did not hesitate to hint&#xD;
that he had taken part in even more lawless and reckless&#xD;
enterprises ; one old woman affirming, - that in going&#xD;
through the house one day, she had seen in a sort, of hum-&#xD;
&#xD;
ber room incautiously left open, various weapons of a&#xD;
murderous character, and a black flag, bearing upon its&#xD;
folds the terrible death's head and cross bones. Be this&#xD;
as it may, his society was generally avoided by the better&#xD;
families of the neighborhood, and the visitors at his home&#xD;
were few and far between. His son, Miles Houghton,&#xD;
was a reckless, daring man, who took an active interest&#xD;
in the field sports of the country,! and was somewhat&#xD;
prominent in local political circles. He was not over&#xD;
nice in the selection of his associates, and as he spent his&#xD;
money freely, he collected around him a, large number of&#xD;
such as were always ready for a spree or at frolic, and&#xD;
enjoyed all the influence that a leading position among&#xD;
such a class, gave him. He had been an aspirant for the&#xD;
hand of Rose Morley, but on the first intimation of his&#xD;
design,l he was met by an indignant refusal, and 'received&#xD;
a hint from William Morley, that any repetition of his&#xD;
advances would be construed as an affront. This re-&#xD;
jection, however, did not altogether check his passion&#xD;
for the young girl; and without making any particu-&#xD;
lar manifestation of his feelings, so far as the verbal ex-&#xD;
pression of them went, hopersistently crossed her path&#xD;
upon all possible occasions, and in various ways insisted&#xD;
upon making her conscious of his preference.&#xD;
Among the most welcome visitors at "The Elms," was&#xD;
Mark Lee, a young man who had originally came from&#xD;
the State of Massachusetts, and who had established him-&#xD;
self as a lawyer in the neighboring town of Lewisburgh,&#xD;
where he stood high in the estimation of all who knew&#xD;
him. He had been elected to the lower house of the&#xD;
State Legislature, and was noted for his staunch patriot'&#xD;
ism, and unwavering fidelity to his friends and any cause&#xD;

ie espoused.  He. had long since found- favor in the&#xD;
eyes of the fair Rose, and the day of their marriage had&#xD;
been fixed at no distant period, shortly before the events&#xD;
we are about to relate, occurred. This preference had&#xD;
awakened all the worst passions of Miles lioughton,&#xD;
and he had often been heard to declare, in his more reek-&#xD;
less moments, that he would be revenged upon the Ismooth&#xD;
faced Yankee, as he called Mark Lee, and he left no'&#xD;
means untried to injure him in his profession, and his po-&#xD;
litical and social position ; without effect, however, as the&#xD;
Mfe of the young lawyer gave the lie to every slander&#xD;
which his traducer put into circulation.&#xD;
Mark Lee and Miles Houghton, both of them, took an&#xD;
active part in the political canvass which resulted in the&#xD;
election, of the present incumbent of the Presidential.&#xD;
chair. Mark espousing the cause of the Union ticket,&#xD;
represented by the names of Bell and Everett, while&#xD;
Houghton, with less ability but more unscrupulous en-&#xD;
thusiasm, was an active worker in the ranks of the ultra&#xD;
Southern party. As is well known, tlie State of Virginia&#xD;
gave the majority of her vote for the Un'ion candidates,&#xD;
and the rancor which existed in the heart of Miles Lough-&#xD;
ton, was not diminished by the evidence of the superior&#xD;
influence of his rival, as displayed in the result in their&#xD;
own district, where the majority for the Union ticket had&#xD;
been overwhelming. Thus matters stood, when the first&#xD;
gun in Charleston harbor sent its fearful reverberation&#xD;
all over the country, and roused up the dead demon,&#xD;
War, which set brother in arms against brother, father'&#xD;
against son, friend against friend; which developed the&#xD;
deep laid treasonous plots of years, and called up the&#xD;
~men of the North to .do battle for the flag £01' which their&#xD;
&#xD;
sires had shed their blood, and to sustain the government&#xD;
under which the nation had grown to bethe marvel of&#xD;
the world. In the wild excitement which followed, none&#xD;
were allowed to stand neutral, and among those who&#xD;
were loudest in their defence of the South, and most de-&#xD;
riunciatory of the North, was Miles Ioughton. Mark&#xD;
Lee, on the contrary, took high conservative ground, and&#xD;
used all his efforts to quell the increasing spirit of insub-&#xD;
ordination which every day became more demonstrative&#xD;
in western Virginia. His enemy of course took advan-&#xD;
tage of this, and used every means in his power to excite&#xD;
the people against him. For a time his efforts were vain,&#xD;
but at last, Mark Lee began -to be shunned, then openly&#xD;
denounced, and so violent (lid the manifestations against&#xD;
him grow to be, that, at last,. he was obliged to flee for&#xD;
his, life, and took refuge under the friendly roof of old&#xD;
Wiliam Morley, who also took sides against the rebel&#xD;
cause. Miles Hloughton, meanwhile, was not idle; by all&#xD;
the means in his power, he added fuel to the flames of&#xD;
treason, and raised a body of nien in defence of the rebel&#xD;
flag, which everywhere disgraced the place of the glo-&#xD;
rious old banner. Knowing the birthplace of Mark Lee,&#xD;
he denounced him as a Northern spy, and managed by&#xD;
the sheerest mendacity, forged papers, letters, &amp;amp;c., td con-&#xD;
vince the people that he was a secret agent of the ultra&#xD;
Abolitionists of the North, and one of the friends of the&#xD;
mad fanatic, John'Brown, whose insane raid had created&#xD;
so much excitement and bitterness but a short time before.&#xD;
Under the effect of these misrepresentations, the excited&#xD;
populace would have torn Mark Lee, limb from limb,&#xD;
could he have been found, but he had suddenly disappear-&#xD;
eod, and all search for him being vain, it was generally be-&#xD;

lieved that he had returned to his native State, and joined&#xD;
the Federal army.&#xD;
Miles, however, more than suspected that he still lurked&#xD;
in the neighborhood, and his jealousy prompted the suspi-&#xD;
cion that he was secreted at "The Elms."  These suspi-&#xD;
cions were confirmed by several minor circumstances&#xD;
which came to his knowledge, and determining to know&#xD;
the truth, he succeeded in obtaining a warrant for his ar-&#xD;
rest, on the charge of being a spy, and a traitor to the&#xD;
Confederate government, to which Virginia had given in&#xD;
her adherence, ald at the time our story opens had de-&#xD;
vised means, for putting his revengeful plans into immrne-&#xD;
diateexecution. With these few explanatory words, we&#xD;
proceed with our narrative, which, with the exception of&#xD;
the names of the principal personages who figure therein,&#xD;
is strictly true.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE sun was just setting behind the western ridge of&#xD;
the Alleghanies, and the whole surrounding landscape&#xD;
was bathed in golden light, as a young girl emerged cau-&#xD;
tiously from a bridle path, which, traversing the woods&#xD;
which bound the eastern side of the Greenbriar river,&#xD;
emerges into the road which leads to Lewisburg in West-&#xD;
ern Virginia. She pursued her way with cautious steps,&#xD;
pausing to listen every now and then, with beating heart,&#xD;
looking anxiously upon this side and the other, and occa-&#xD;
sionally stopping to gaze behind her, as if she feared pur-&#xD;
suit. Suddenly a sharp turn in the road brought her to&#xD;
the edge of a high blufl, from which she could overlook&#xD;
the surrounding country, which lay spread out like a map&#xD;
at her feet. Through the lovely valley, which lay below,&#xD;
the' river meandered on, in its zigzag course, looking, as&#xD;
it reflected the rays of the setting sun, like a belt of bur-&#xD;
nished gold, while far off to the right, the high peaks of&#xD;
the Blue Ridge might be seen towering to the. sky. The&#xD;
cattle grazed peacefully in the rick green pastures; the&#xD;
stacks of corn, which rose here and there, betokened&#xD;
plenty, and the whole scene was calm and peaceful. As&#xD;
the maiden thus stood, her ears were suddenly startled by&#xD;
the sound of a bugle, and the hoarse shouts of men.&#xD;
Quickly turning to the left, and half screening her form&#xD;

TE REFUGEE ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
behind the giant trunk of a huge 'sycamore, which spread&#xD;
its branches high above her head, she saw a troop of&#xD;
horsemen emerge from a dense wood below, and take&#xD;
their way along the river bank, in the direction of Lewis-&#xD;
burgh. The cortege numbered in all about two hundred&#xD;
men. They were not uniformned. Each wore such gar-&#xD;
nents as suited him, but all carried swords, and carbines&#xD;
Lung from their shoulders. At their head rode an officer&#xD;
im.the uniform of the United States, bitt the flag which&#xD;
was borne immediately behind him, showed that he was a&#xD;
traitor to the government whose glorious insignia he&#xD;
wore, and thpt he belonged to those, who, with fratricidal&#xD;
hand, had risen in arms against it. As the young girl&#xD;
gazed upon this sight,:ber eye dilated and her lovely lip&#xD;
curled in scorn and indignation.&#xD;
"So so," she muttered between her teeth, "you have&#xD;
consummated your hellish wish at last, Miles Houghton.&#xD;
Traitor and renegade that you are! Ha !" she exclaim-&#xD;
ed, as the troop turned into a lane which crossed the&#xD;
main road. "Ha! they are going towards 'The Elms,'&#xD;
and Mark Lee.   There is no time to be lost.  I can&#xD;
reach the hut before them, and may save him yet. They&#xD;
know not of the hiding place."&#xD;
Giving one last look at the receding band, she darted&#xD;
quickly away, and taking to the woods, sped swiftly&#xD;
along, with the evident intention of getting in advance of&#xD;
the party of insurgents whom she had seen in the valley&#xD;
below. Heedless of all obstacles, she pursued her course&#xD;
through the dense woods for at least a mile, when she&#xD;
was suddenly startled by the unexpected appearance of a&#xD;
negro, who suddenly emerged from a thicket, and stood,.&#xD;
with hands upraised and mouth wide open, directly in&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
her path. He was as dark as Erebus, small of stature,&#xD;
and though not passed fifty years of age, looked at&#xD;
least twenty years older. His limbs were crooked. he&#xD;
had but one eye, and so warped and distorted were his&#xD;
hands, that they looked more like the talons of some&#xD;
huge bird than a portion of a human being.&#xD;
"IHi, hi !" he exclaimed. "Gracious Solomon, what's&#xD;
de matter, missed, dat you're a lopin along trough de&#xD;
woods, like a deer on de full jump? Why, you looks as&#xD;
sheered as a rabbit wid de dogs after it. What's de&#xD;
matter ?"&#xD;
" Ah, Cupid,'is it you ?" asked the young girl, gasping&#xD;
for breath, "You frightened me dreadfully. But I have&#xD;
no time to waste in words ; danger is at hand. From&#xD;
the bluff above I observed a party of arined rebels, with&#xD;
Miles Iloughton at their head. They are moving in the&#xD;
direction of 'The Elms,' and I fear me with no good pur.&#xD;
pose.' Miles knows that Mr. Lee has been our guest&#xD;
there for a week past, and in his hate and jealousy he will&#xD;
be capable of any act of cowardly violence. The mo-&#xD;
ment I saw the traitorous wretches I hastened to warn&#xD;
him, and-"&#xD;
"Dat's right, Missee, data's right !" interrupted the ne-&#xD;
gro, " Mass'r Lee mustn't be caught dar like a woodchuck&#xD;
in a hole. I'll go right along and fix it all right. Ise&#xD;
only a cripple, but I'd run dese old legs off for Mass'r&#xD;
Lee, or any other man wot don't go back on de old flag.&#xD;
As for dat trashy Miles Houghton, I just wish dis nigger&#xD;
had de fixin' ob him, dat's all! Come along, Missee,&#xD;
come along. I'll go ahead to de Elms. You go right&#xD;
straight along to de old cabin by de creek, and I'll have&#xD;

THE REFUGEES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Without waiting for her reply, the old negro darted&#xD;
off with an alacrity which his crippled form made sure&#xD;
prising, and in a moment was out of sight.&#xD;
The girl, evidently experiencing a sensation of relief,&#xD;
then followed with hasty steps, and in a short time reach-&#xD;
ed a solitary log-cabin, which stood in front of a high&#xD;
rock, by the side of a wide brook, which brawled on its&#xD;
way to the neighboring river.&#xD;
Hastily opening the door, she entered the humble lodge-&#xD;
nient and gazed anxiously around her.&#xD;
"Not here," she exclaimed, as she finished, her hasty&#xD;
survey. ",ray Heaven the warning arrive not too late.&#xD;
But.he may be in the inner room." Going to a door to&#xD;
the right, she pushed it open and entered another apart-&#xD;
ment, less spacious than the first, and fitted up as a sleep-&#xD;
ing chamber.&#xD;
"No, he is not here."&#xD;
As she spoke she turned to leave the, room, when a&#xD;
noise, proceeding apparently from the Iloor of the cham-&#xD;
ber, attracted her attention. Instantly stooping, she look-&#xD;
ed cautiously around, paused a moment as if to make sure&#xD;
that no one was approaching, and then, taking a key from&#xD;
her bosom. she pressed it against what appeared to be a&#xD;
knot in the rough floor. As she did so, the knot sank,&#xD;
leaving a small aperture in the rough plank, at the side of&#xD;
which appeared a key-hole, into which she quietly insert-&#xD;
ed the key, and turning a bolt, she half rose, and placing&#xD;
her hand 4 the space left by the sinking knot, raised, a&#xD;
trap-door which concealed the entrance to a subterranean&#xD;
passage, then bending her heady she listened. For a time&#xD;
she heard no sound save the beating of her heart and her&#xD;
own loud breathing, but, presently, the noise of' distant&#xD;

the lovely girl in his arms, and pressing his lips upon her&#xD;
fair brow, "How shall I thank vou for your kindness and&#xD;
your care? my own dear Rose-2"&#xD;
Hush !" she said, interrupting him, " we have no time&#xD;
to waste in words. You must go, and quickly. Miles&#xD;
Houghton is even now in hot pursuit of you. Should he&#xD;
find you, I cannot foretell the consequences. You know&#xD;
his hate, his desperate character, his lack of principle, his&#xD;
vow of vengeance !&#xD;
".The miscreant !" exclaimed the young man. "The&#xD;
vile traitor, and the malignant coward!  Because you&#xD;
would not smile upon him; because you preferred myV&#xD;
honest love to his wild, reckless passion, he seeks to take&#xD;
advantage of the maddening excitement which these vile,&#xD;
traitorous wretches have produced by their specious lies&#xD;
and misrepresentations, to crush me from his ith. iHe&#xD;
calls me traitor ! He, forsooth, who turns his back upon&#xD;
the flag my father died to make triumplhant, and under&#xD;
which we, as a nation, have grown great, prosperous, and&#xD;
happy! He has trampled that sacred banner under foot,&#xD;
and raised in its place the foul emblem of disloyalty.&#xD;
And because I will not so disgrace the patriotic blood&#xD;
which flows within these veins, I am denounced, a price is&#xD;
set upon me, I am hounded from place to place, obliged&#xD;
to avoid the open day, to hide in secret nooks and cor-&#xD;
ners, to fly my country, which I love, and thee whom I&#xD;
adore! Oh that Amerjcans should be obliged to blush&#xD;
for their own countrymen !"&#xD;
"Dat's all very nice, Mass'r Lee," here interrupted&#xD;
Cupid, who, meanwhile, had kindled a fire on the hearth,   i&#xD;
and lit a pine knot, which threwv a lurid glare around the&#xD;
little room. " Dat ar's all very well, but if you stay har,&#xD;

"But," answered Mark Lee, " where can I go ? How&#xD;
shall I escape?  My existence in the neighborhood is&#xD;
well known, and my appearance familiar to every man,&#xD;
woman, and child for miles around. I am single-handed,&#xD;
without a friend, unarmed! There are, none safe your&#xD;

" Alas.! I feel the truth of all you say, dear Mark," re-&#xD;
sponded the lovely girl, as tears of love and sympathy&#xD;
streamed rapidly down her cheeks, " but here, the danger&#xD;
is increased by every moment's stay. Houghton and his,&#xD;

they discover you, you are lost!"&#xD;

given it broad rivers, wide lakes, valleys, and mountains&#xD;
teeming with the bounties of thy hand. Thou hast made&#xD;
it a dwelling place fit for angels, and yet, those to whom&#xD;
thou hast given it, are striving to lay it waste, to make a -&#xD;

&#xD;
Oh were I free, once more under the folds of that dear&#xD;
flag, whose every star sheds light and hope upon a free-&#xD;
man's heart !"&#xD;
"Hope, hope, dear Mark !" sobbed the girl, as she lean-&#xD;
ed upon his breast.&#xD;
" Hope !" he repeated, bitterly. " Ah, Rose, there is no&#xD;
hope. No hope for me or for my country! And thee,&#xD;
Rose, thee whom I love so tenderly, thee whom I thought&#xD;
to call my bride, within a few short days. Ah, how can&#xD;
I separate myself from thee? How leave thee ?"&#xD;
"But," replied Rose, "you know, dear Mark, that your&#xD;
presence here, may destroy me as well. Were it once&#xD;
suspected that I harbored a Federalist, all their hatred&#xD;
would fall on me, and we know of what such hate is ca-&#xD;
pable."&#xD;
Here a loud rap was heard upon the door. All started&#xD;
in aifright, and stood as if spell-bound at the alarm.&#xD;
Cupid was the first to move. Without saying a word,&#xD;
he made signs for all to keep silent; then seizing Mark&#xD;
Lee by the arm, he pointed to the trap-door. Once more&#xD;
taking the weeping Rose to his arms, Mark obeyed the&#xD;
sign , and in a moment disappeared. The rapping still&#xD;
continued, while Cupid reclosed the opening and led Rose&#xD;
to the door of the inner chamber, when he pushed her&#xD;
gently in, and proceeded deliberately to unbar the door,&#xD;
yawning and gaping meanwhile, as if just awakened from&#xD;
a deep sleep.&#xD;
" Helld! Hello ! Who's dar ?" he asked, peering out&#xD;
into the darkness. "What de debbil you come liar, dis&#xD;
time o' night for, 'sturbin de old niggah out o' his nap?&#xD;

He had not long to wait, for even as he spoke, a man&#xD;
pushed him aside and strode into the cabin.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THE man who entered the little apartment, was not a&#xD;
fearful object to behold. He was-rather below the me-&#xD;
dium size, and was dressed in a suit of linsey-woolsey&#xD;
much too large foi' him, and which gave him the appear-&#xD;
ance of having shrunk in his clothes. He wore a grey&#xD;
felt hat, with a very wide and limp brim, which threw&#xD;
into deep shadow a strongly marked yet not unpleasing&#xD;
face. He had a firm, compressed mouth, bespeaking&#xD;
much determination, and wore a pair of green spectacles,&#xD;
which completely shut out his eyes, and added very much&#xD;
to the oddity of his appearance. He carried a walking-&#xD;
stick under one arm, and under the other a book of pecu-&#xD;
liar shape.&#xD;
As he entered, Cupid looked at him in great astonish-&#xD;
ment, which increased to such an extent when the stran-&#xD;
ger deliberately turned his back to the fire, and com-&#xD;
menced to hum Old Hundred, that the bewildered son of&#xD;
Ham quite forgot to shut the door, or say a single word,&#xD;
but stood, like a misshapen mummy, with eyes and mouth&#xD;
agape, gazing at what he evidently took for a newly in.&#xD;
vented style of apparition.&#xD;
Why in thunder. don't'you shut the door?" asked the&#xD;
stranger, without changing his position, and eyeing the&#xD;
old negro with some severity, through his green glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Reckon you was brought up in a saw-mill, wasn't you?&#xD;
Shut the door, I tell you, you blamed, grinning ape ! I'm&#xD;
cold !"&#xD;
Cupid obeyed, mechanically, still all abroad.&#xD;
"Now put up the bar, and if you've got anything in the&#xD;
shanty that a white man can drink, trot it out! I m dry!&#xD;
A little hog and hominy wouldn't go bad neither{ if you&#xD;
aint out o' rations."&#xD;
Gradually Cupid began to realize that the object he&#xD;
was gazing at was not a ghost, and his face subsided into&#xD;
something akin to his natural expression, as he spluttered&#xD;
out:&#xD;
"Hi! hi! mass'r, God fo'gib me, but I tuck you for a&#xD;
ghost! Who de debbil be ye, anyhow, and what do you&#xD;
want ?"&#xD;
"Who be I? I'm Handel Hayden Beethoven Brown,&#xD;
Professor of Psalmody, and teacher of Botany, Geology,&#xD;
and Mathematics. That's who I am. What do I want?&#xD;
Shelter, warmth, some whisky, and a right smart chance&#xD;
to eat. The first I've got unless you put me out, a thing&#xD;
you aint shaped to do, and the other you are going to trot&#xD;
out, if you've got 'em; ef not, I reckon I can do without&#xD;
'em, as I have before."&#xD;
So saying, the stranger backed nearer to the fire, and&#xD;
opening the book which he had carried under his arm, he&#xD;
commenced to hum one of those old-fashioned hymn tunes,&#xD;
go popular with the negroes.&#xD;
Cupid did not seem at all satisfied either with the ex-&#xD;
planation or the demand upon his hospitality, but stood&#xD;
eyeing the suspicious stranger askance through his soli-&#xD;
tary orb. As he did so, the Professor seemed to become&#xD;
absorbed in the tune he was humming, and his voice grew&#xD;

THE REFUGEES; OR,&#xD;
louder and louder, until, at last, it burst forth in a strong,&#xD;
ear-splitting strain of nasal melody.&#xD;
In direct proportion to the loudness of the strain, Cu-&#xD;
pid's one eye and his mouth distended themselves, his&#xD;
head, arms, and feet keeping time to the music, until,&#xD;
Ihially, he could resist the impulse no longer, and joined&#xD;
i the melodyTwith a loud and not unmusical voice.&#xD;
The stranger, apparently unheeding him, continued&#xD;
singing' until all the verses of the hymn had come in for&#xD;
their full share of vocal effect, when he suddenly stopped.&#xD;
Then Cupid brokeout:&#xD;
"Lor' a g'u'ry, mass'r, dat does here nigger's soul good !&#xD;
Ii, hiI"  You kin hal) anything dis here nigger's&#xD;
got! you kin ! Lor' bless you, mass' r, you sings just like&#xD;
a bird! Anything dis nigger's got," and going to a little&#xD;
cupboard, he produced a stone jug, a tin cup, a piece of&#xD;
bacon, and some corn bread, which lie placed upon the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
lhe stranger did not wait for any further invitation,&#xD;
but drawing up a three-legged stool, sat down at the ta-&#xD;
ble, and pouring some of the contents of the jug into the&#xD;
tin cup. put it to his nose.&#xD;
Whisky, mass'r," said Cupid. " Good, too. None o'&#xD;
your nigger rot-gut, mass'r. Drink hearty! 'Twont hurt&#xD;
you."'&#xD;
Thus enlightened, the stranger drained the cup at a&#xD;
draught, and cutting off a piece of the bacon, he placed it&#xD;
on a piece of the corn bread, and commenced eating vo-&#xD;
raciously.&#xD;
" Does you belong in dose parts, mass'r ?" asked Cupid,&#xD;
with a quick glance of awakened curiosity beaming in his&#xD;
single eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF '61.&#xD;
"See here-what's your name?" asked the stranger,&#xD;
without answering the question.&#xD;
" Cupid," answered the negro, grinning, " dey calls me&#xD;
Cupid, cause I's so handsome."&#xD;
"Well, Cupid," the Professor of psalmody went on,&#xD;
"don't ask any questions, but answer mine. You live&#xD;
here, of. course ?&#xD;
"Lived here all my life, mass'r."&#xD;
"Know the folks about here pretty well ?"&#xD;
"I reckon,"&#xD;
"Know the Morleys?"&#xD;
" Right smart. I belongs to Mass'r Morley, I does."&#xD;
" He owns you, does he?  Well, I reckon he's proud o'&#xD;
that. Then you know his daughter, Rose."&#xD;
What you want to know dat for ?"&#xD;
"Didn't I tell you to ask no questions?" -&#xD;
Well, sposen I do, what den ?"&#xD;
"And a young man named Mark Lee ?"&#xD;
"No, rnass'r, I doesn't know nuffin at all about em!&#xD;
" See here," replied the Professor, rising, "if you lie to&#xD;
me, I'll choke you! Tell me the truth. You do know&#xD;
them !"&#xD;
"Well, spose I does ?"&#xD;
" Then listen to me. I know your master is a straight&#xD;
out-and-out Union man. Don't say a word-I know it--&#xD;
that's enough. So am I."&#xD;
"See here, mass'r, I don't know what de debbil you be,&#xD;
or who de debbil you are, 'cept what you told mec. -But I&#xD;

don't know. I know Squire Morley to be sound. I know&#xD;
Mark Lee to be sound. I know Rose Morley to be sound.&#xD;
i'm sound, and so are you, you black imp of Satan. So&#xD;
listen to me. The hounds are after Mark. They. passed&#xD;
the place wlre I. was hid, not half an hour ago. They&#xD;
have gone to the Squire's to look for him. But he aint&#xD;
there, I know that. I don't know where he is, but I reck-&#xD;
on you do, and so does Miss Rose, and I'd bet a quarter's&#xD;
teaching in psalnody agin a green punkin, that they paint&#xD;
a thousand miles away from this here place."&#xD;
"See here. mass'r-" Cupid began, but the Professor&#xD;
interrupted him:&#xD;
"You know where they be, and so maybe do I. You&#xD;
see, I'm a geologist; a geologist is a man who knows all&#xD;
about rocks and things. Well, in hunting around these&#xD;
rocks last summer, I found a cave. It aint a very big one,-&#xD;
only a long fissure in the limestone formation about here.&#xD;
It leads from the Devil'si Pulpit, back of the orchard at&#xD;
the Elms, as straight as a bee line to this cabin, and that&#xD;
cave contains at this very moment, Mark Lee. But I'll&#xD;
have him out. The opening is here!"&#xD;
With these words he rose quickly, and bursting open&#xD;
the door of the inner chamber, he was about to enter the&#xD;
apartment, when he staggered back at the sight of Rose,&#xD;
who stood upon the threshold, holding an axe in her&#xD;
hand, which the flush in her cheek and the determination&#xD;
in her eye, proved she would not hesitate to use-.a&#xD;
"DBack, on your life!I" she exclaimed, raising the axe&#xD;
above her head. "Back, I say! I will defend him to&#xD;
the last 1"&#xD;
Cupid, meanwhile, had seized the long wooden bar&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF 61.&#xD;
which had served to barricade the door, and advancing in&#xD;
the rear of the Professor, called out.:&#xD;
" Leave him to me, Missee Rose! leave him to me! I'll&#xD;
fix him!"&#xD;
Thus threatened both in front and rear, the Professor&#xD;
stood for a moment bewildered, but collecting his presence&#xD;
'of mind, he raised his hands, and half turning to Cupid, in&#xD;
order to guard against any sudden belligerent impulse of&#xD;
the excited darkey, he said in a tone entirely different&#xD;
from that which had heretofore characterized his manner:&#xD;
"For heaven's sake, Rose Morley, listen to me! Mark&#xD;
Lee is indeed honored in having so bold aid fair a de-&#xD;
fender. But so far as I and Iy intentions are concerned,&#xD;
your alarm is groundless and defence unnecessary. Do&#xD;
you know me now ?" With these words he removed his&#xD;
hat, and with it the long flaxen hair and spectacles which&#xD;
.he had previously worn, and throwing the disguise at Cu-&#xD;
pid, said with a laugh, "And now, Miss Rose, please to&#xD;
take down that murderous looking axe. I do not think&#xD;
you will find further occasion for its use 1"&#xD;
Rose gazed a moment in complete bewilderment, then&#xD;
dropping the axe, exclaimed in a tone of wonder:&#xD;
"Carlton Howard1"&#xD;
" Mass'r Howard, as I'm a nigger I" exclaimed Cupid,&#xD;
letting the bar fall, and bursting into a laugh. "Yalh I&#xD;
yahi! ha! And I didn't know him. I'll go right away&#xD;
and butt out dis stupid nigger's brainsI"&#xD;
"And now, Miss Rose," said Carlton Howard, extend-&#xD;
ing his hand, you will not object, perhaps, to my proposed&#xD;
interview with the young gentleman whom you have so&#xD;
bravely defended ?"&#xD;

cost me my life just now; they will help to save his."&#xD;
Almost as quickly as suggested, the change of apparel&#xD;
was effected, ,and Mark Lee was transformed so complete-&#xD;
ly as to defy recognition.&#xD;
"Gorry, mass'r," exclaimed Cupid, grinning all over&#xD;
his black face with glee, "your own mother would not&#xD;
know you!"&#xD;
"Now away !" urged Howard. "Keep to the-left bank&#xD;
of the rivei'.  When you reach Tiger creek you will&#xD;
come'to a cabin, upon the ioof of which you will see a&#xD;
branch of a pine tree standing. Knock fearlessly at the&#xD;
door. A man will answer you. He will ask you 'How&#xD;
the river runs?' You will answer 'North.' He vill re-&#xD;
spond 'Yorktown.' You may then mention my name.&#xD;
He will ferry you across the river, and put you on the&#xD;
road. When you part with him, tell him that the eagle&#xD;
will leave his nest when the moon is at its full. He will&#xD;
understand you. Do not forget anything I have told&#xD;
you-and away !"&#xD;
"Rose, farewell !" exclaimed Mark, pressing the young&#xD;
girl to 4is heart, and imprinting a kiss upon her paling&#xD;
cheek. "Farewell! We shall meet again, if not upon&#xD;
earth, at least in heaven! Bless you!1"&#xD;
Rose did not respond, but her heaving bosom told how&#xD;
keenly she felt the separation from her lover, and how&#xD;
anxiously her loving heart beat for his safety.&#xD;
"Good-by, Howard! I hope soon to stand shoulder to&#xD;
shoulder with you, doing battle in defence of our dear&#xD;
country! Good-by, Cupid, I know you will be true to&#xD;
the last."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF '61.&#xD;
&#xD;
With these words Mark cast a last glance of affection&#xD;
upon her lie loved, and stepped towards the door. As his&#xD;
hand touched the latch, the loud blast of a bugle sounded&#xD;
clear and full.&#xD;
All started. Had a thunderbolt fallen in their midst,&#xD;
the consternation depicted in their faces could not have&#xD;
been greater. Cupid rushed instantly and barred the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
Howard was the first to speak.&#xD;
"Too late! too late!1" he exclaimed, in a low voice.&#xD;
"They are even now at the door! Quick, the cave !" and&#xD;
he moved towards the inner apartment, drawing Mark af-&#xD;
ter him.&#xD;
"But Rose," exclaimed Mark, "I cannot leave her thus&#xD;
exposed to-"&#xD;
"Fear not!" said the brave girl. They will scarcely&#xD;
dare to harm me. Secure your own safety. Cupid and&#xD;
I can defend ourselves!"&#xD;
As she spoke, a sound as if the door had been struck&#xD;
with the butt end of a gun, fell upon their ears, and a&#xD;
rough voice exclaimed : "Open quick or we will break&#xD;
it in!"&#xD;
" Quick ! quick !" urged Howard, and almost forcing&#xD;
Mark along, they reached the mouth of the cave.&#xD;
"Down with you," Howard murmured, in a suppressed&#xD;
but firm voice, as the noise outside the door increased in&#xD;
violence. "Down ! It is freedom or nothing !"&#xD;
Thus urged, Mark jumped into the opening below,&#xD;
quickly followed by Howard. Cupid sprung instantly to&#xD;
close the trap, and had barely done so, when the door was&#xD;
violently burst open, and three men strode into the cabin.&#xD;

THE REFUGEES: OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE  first who  entered  the  cabin  was  Miles Houghtoi&#xD;
lie was a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a low, si]&#xD;
sister expression, to which a deep nar upon his cheek&#xD;
served to add. his eyes were small. jet black, and pie&#xD;
cing as an eagle's. He had a low forehead, over wh&#xD;
his coarse )lack hair fell in disorder. His beard a&#xD;
moustache were slightly grizzled with straggling gr&#xD;
hairs, and his whole -appearance indicated a manm of e&#xD;
ergy, recklessness, and determination, unchecked and nu&#xD;
guided by any strong moral principle. He was dress&#xD;
in the uniform of a United States officer, and wore rour&#xD;
his waist a belt, in which were inserted a pair of lar&#xD;
navy revolvers, and a dragoon's salbre dangled at h&#xD;
heels.&#xD;
Of the two men who followed him, one was named Jeo&#xD;
Black, a low-sized, rowdyish looking fellow, who acted&#xD;
the Lieutenant of the rebel Captain, though he wore 1&#xD;
uniform, and the other was known as Tom Dill, a wil&#xD;
haram-scarum fellow, fatuous in the neighborhood for h&#xD;
love of whisky, poker, dog fighting, and his general shil&#xD;
lessness. He had a rolicking, good natured expressio&#xD;
generally, save when he attempted to speak, when his fl&#xD;
underwent the most hideous contortions, and every hia&#xD;
in his body sesmned to writhe as if he were tormented&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF '61.&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
some invisible fiend. He rarely uttered more than half a&#xD;
word at a time, but would return to the effort to express&#xD;
himself, again and again, until he succeeded in making&#xD;
himself understood. He was familiarly spoken of as&#xD;
Stuttering Tom, a soubriquet which he certainly earned.&#xD;
As these three worthies entered the cabin, Houghton&#xD;
called in a rough tone to the mhen outside: " halt where&#xD;
you are! Keep a good lookout, and if anyone attempts&#xD;
to escape, shoot him !"&#xD;
Cupid, the moment the door was broken had seized a&#xD;
large pine stick which stood by the fire-place, and had&#xD;
planted himself in an attitude of defiance in front of the&#xD;
inner room, with the determination of protecting his young&#xD;
mistress and her lover with his life, if necessary. He&#xD;
.f .c               ss.y- .&#xD;
still maintained his position without speaking a word.&#xD;
Hello, you black scoundrel, what the devil are you&#xD;
doing there, and why did you not open the door when I&#xD;
rapped, without putting me to the trouble of breaking it&#xD;
in?  Come away from there, and tell ne where that ren-&#xD;
egade, Mark Lee, is concealed-for you know-or I'll put&#xD;
daylight through that black carcass of yours in a mo-&#xD;
ment!" exclaimed Houghton, drawing a pistol from his&#xD;
belt and leveling it at the negro. " Come away from&#xD;
there, I say, and take down that stick !"&#xD;
"See here, Mister Houghton," replied Cupid, bracing&#xD;
himself still more firmly, and spitting on lis-hands, in or-&#xD;
der to get a firmer grasp on his extemporized weapon,&#xD;
you kin shoot if you've a mind to. 'Taint no more than&#xD;
a nigger could spec from you, any way. But dis here is&#xD;
my shanty, and not a foot furder into it do you git dan&#xD;
you be now, as long as dis 'ere nigger's got one bit o'life&#xD;
in his body. Dar So stand back!"&#xD;

"I'll teach you to threaten a white man, you black&#xD;
mangy cur !" growled Houg'hton, lveling his pistol full&#xD;
at poor Cupid, who looked with his one eye upon. the&#xD;
threatening muzzle wildly, but neither trembled nor gave&#xD;
way. "If'you aint away from there in one second, I'll-n"&#xD;
Ere he could finish the sentence, his hand fell, and he&#xD;
staggered back as though he had been shot himself, as&#xD;
Rose, pushing Cupid on one side, stepped from the inner&#xD;
room and stood defiantly before the traitor's face.&#xD;
" Or else you would murder him, Miles loughton.&#xD;
That is what vu mean. Shame on you, shame I" The&#xD;
traitor's cheek turned ashen pale, and his eyes glared like&#xD;
those of a wild beast, as h gazed upon the lovely being&#xD;
before him, and saw her lip curl in indignant scorn as she&#xD;
looked upon liim..&#xD;
" I did not expect to find the proud Rose Morley in,&#xD;
such a place, at such a time," answered Houghton, sul-&#xD;
lenly.&#xD;
"What do you here?   You are trespassing. This is,&#xD;
my father's property. I bid you begone !"&#xD;
"Yes, get out o' dis," exclaimed Cupid. " Get out!&#xD;
We'll hab de law on you suah! Ebery white man's hum&#xD;
is, his castle, and ebery nigger's cabin is his shield and&#xD;
buckler. So git out and git !"&#xD;
"Silence!" roared Jem. " Shut up or I'll split that&#xD;
thick skull o' yourn."&#xD;
"O-o-o---" stammered Tom, "O-o-o---" but he could get&#xD;
no further, so he cut his remarks short by burying the&#xD;
lower part of his face in the tin cup which he had nearly&#xD;
filled with whisky, and thus left the world for ever in ig&#xD;
norance of the thought with which his mind was exer-&#xD;
cised.4&#xD;
&#xD;
"What bringsyou here ?" asked Rose.&#xD;
"Our errand is plain enough," responded Miles Hough-&#xD;
ton, roughly. " We are in search of a renegade and a&#xD;
traitor-a poor puling, cowardly doughface, who Chas de-&#xD;
serted the cause to whicl he naturally owes allegiance,&#xD;
and who is more than suspected of being a spy in the ser-&#xD;
vice of the Yankees. He is not at "The Elms," where&#xD;
we know he has been concealed for some days, and we&#xD;
have good reason to believe that he is concealed some-&#xD;
where hereabout."&#xD;
"When you apply the names renegade and traitor to&#xD;
to Mark Lee,",responded Rose, "your ownJheart, Miles&#xD;
Houghton, tells you that you speak falsely. 'Tis you who&#xD;
are the renegade and traitor, and not he I You have desert-&#xD;
ed the cause of your country in her utmost need. You&#xD;
have turned your back upon her flag, when enemies assail&#xD;
it upon every hand. You have, like a coward, taken ad-&#xD;
vantage of the present time, when treason dares to vaunt&#xD;
itself in mid-day, to pursue and crush a true man, whom,&#xD;
were it not for the number like yourself, who stand at&#xD;
your back, you would not dare to face. 'Tis you who are&#xD;
the traitor ! You the coward! Mark Lee is worth a thou-&#xD;
sand such as you, and when you do meet him on equal&#xD;
terms, you will rue the day !"&#xD;
"Nay," answered the rebel, with a powerful effort,&#xD;
smothering the rage which filled his heart, "I can forgive&#xD;
your words. But listen to me. This man cannot escape&#xD;
us. The whole of our men are on the lookout for him.&#xD;
We are on his track, and we shall surely run him down.&#xD;
If he is taken, I will not answer for the consequences.&#xD;
The men are very bitter against him, and if his life does&#xD;
not pay the forfeit of his unpatriotic course, he will at&#xD;

least suffer long and sorely. But if you really feel the&#xD;
interest in him which' you profess, it is in your power to&#xD;
save him."&#xD;
How ?" asked Rose, earnestly.&#xD;
By promising to see him no more, and by giving mn1&#xD;
but one kind look, one smile, one word of hope !"&#xD;
"Such words to Ine!" exclaimed the girl, proudly.&#xD;
You forget yourself! Begone !"&#xD;
a ._.&#xD;
Oh, your pride is not broken yet, I see !" grumbled&#xD;
Miles, " Well, come here, nay, come, I will not harm&#xD;
you. I'll show you something that may humble it, strong&#xD;
and unyielding as it is." And ioughton. stepped towards&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"I do not fear you, and I will not leave this spot," she&#xD;
answered firmly.&#xD;
"Look out, my pretty bird, beware! You carry it&#xD;
with a high head, but remember that I have but to say&#xD;
the word, and your !iberty, if not . our life, is forfeited as&#xD;
much as his !"1Then turning to the two subordinates who&#xD;
had entered with him, he said quickly: "Lieutenant&#xD;
Black and Sergeant Dill. commence the search, leave no&#xD;
nook or corner unexplored, and if you find the renegade,&#xD;
bring him out dead or alive !"&#xD;
Thus ordered, the two men commenced the search, and&#xD;
entered into the inner room.&#xD;
You a: e welcome to search," Rose said, in a bantering&#xD;
tone. Hie is far away ere this, beyond your reach !"&#xD;
"Perhaps," replied Houghton, "but if not and he is&#xD;
found concealed, I swear whatever his fate may be you&#xD;
shall share it!"&#xD;
." There is no one here, Colonel, said Lieut. Black, now&#xD;
returning to the outer room. " We have. searched every&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
hole big enough for a mouse to creep through. If he was&#xD;
ever here, he's gone."&#xD;
"We fo-fo fo-fo-fo !" stuttered Bill, " we fo-fo-fo-"&#xD;
"There, postpone that till next week, or else write it,&#xD;
Sergeant," said Houghton, roughly. "I have no time to&#xD;
wait for the birth of that piece of information."&#xD;
The Sergeant had recourse a second time to the whis-&#xD;
ky-jug, and smothered his indignation in its contents.&#xD;
"I swear I will not be thus baffled! You have aided in&#xD;
his escape," almost shouted Houghton, and by heaven&#xD;
you shall pay the penalty !"&#xD;
"What mean you ?" asked Rose, with somewhat of fear&#xD;
in her tones, you surely would not-"&#xD;
"I would do anything," he interrupted, "I would brave&#xD;
hell, your hate, the hate of all mankind, to be revenged&#xD;
on him! Seize that woman, and bear her with us! She&#xD;
is a traitress, and has aided and abetted in the escape of&#xD;
the renegade, Mark Lee !"&#xD;
The man addressed did not stir.&#xD;
"What. am I disobeyed ?"&#xD;
"Col-col-colcol-" began Tom Dill, but Houghton cut&#xD;
him short by commanding silence. "By heaven!I he&#xD;
exclaimed, "you shall not slip from my hands! If you&#xD;
will not be mine you shall not be his !"&#xD;
With these words Houghton advanced towards Rose,&#xD;
who retreated in terror into the inner room, where Miles&#xD;
quickly followed her, and was just about to seize her in&#xD;
his arms, when the floor seemed to open at his feet, and&#xD;
Carlton Howard stood before him!&#xD;
Leveling a pistol at the head of the rebel ruffian, he ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
"Stir but a hand, and you are a dead man!1&#xD;

Miles iougjhton staggered back in surprise and won-&#xD;
der, while Rose, springing forward, passed behind Cupid,&#xD;
who had opened the trap, and who stood with the axe&#xD;
raised high above his head, ready to repel any assault up-&#xD;
on his young mistress or himself. She leaped down into&#xD;
the cave and disappeared, instantly followed by Carlton&#xD;
howard, leaving the rebel leader alone with Cupid, and&#xD;
for a moment in a state of complete bewilderment. Quick-&#xD;
ly recovering his presence of -mind, however, he discharg-&#xD;
ed his pistol at Cupid, and without waiting to see the re-&#xD;
suit of his shot, shouted at the top of his voice:&#xD;
Hither, Black ! We shall have them now !"&#xD;
Then giving, orders for the bulk of the men to spread&#xD;
in all directions, in scouting parties, and commanding a&#xD;
few to follow him, he jumped into the cave, with a wild&#xD;
shout and was lost to sight.&#xD;
The cabin was. instantly filled with men. Jein Black&#xD;
was the first to follow his leader, and he was succeeded&#xD;
by Stuttering Tom, but his attempt to follow the example&#xD;
set by his Colonel and the Lieutenant, was not successful,&#xD;
for as he jumped, the skirts of his coat caught in the edge&#xD;
of the opening and held him suspended, so that he could&#xD;
neither get up nor further down, thus effectually blocking&#xD;
up the opening and preventing the others from going in.&#xD;
F-fo-for" he began, "If-fo-fo-for G-gg-g-od's sake,&#xD;
ho-ho-ho-hold me up, or cu-cu cu-cut off my co-co-co-coat&#xD;
tail !"&#xD;
As it took sdme time to get this sentence into anything&#xD;
like intelligible shape, and as, meanwhile, his body went&#xD;
through the most terrible contortions, when, at last, he&#xD;
had succeeded in making the suggestion, the necessity for&#xD;
its execution had passed, for he had fairly wi-ithed himself&#xD;
&#xD;
out of his garment, and slipping from its hold upon him,&#xD;
lie dropped with a dull thud into the cave below.&#xD;
The rest instantly followed, and then Cupid rose un-&#xD;
harmed from the corner where he had fallen at the report&#xD;
of the pistol, and after first shaking himself, and then feel&#xD;
ing himself all over, to make sure he was not hit, he&#xD;
quickly-ran into the front room, and seizing the pine knot,&#xD;
which still blazed on the hearth, he placed it in the mid-&#xD;
die of the floor-then dragging the bed from the other&#xD;
room, he tore open the mattress, and heaped the straw&#xD;
upon the blazing wood, upon which, as soon as he saw it&#xD;
fairly ignited, he quickly piled all the furniture;, then&#xD;
hastily quitting the cabin, and going down to the bed of&#xD;
tle creek, he crept cautiously away.&#xD;
By the time lie had gone a few hundred yards, the light&#xD;
of the burning cabin lit up the scene for some distance&#xD;
around. As the negro saw the effect of his desperate&#xD;
act, he chuckled aloud :&#xD;
"Ki! ki! I reckon dat'll fix you! If you don't find&#xD;
de oder end of de cave, I reckon you'll stay dar for some&#xD;
time, if you isn't sufekated wid de smoke, and find you-&#xD;
sefs done gone altogeder. But good golly, what de deb-&#xD;
bil's dat?" hs exclaimed, as he lqoked up and saw a still&#xD;
brighter light reddening the sky in another direction.&#xD;
Streams of flame and volumes of dark smoke rose be-&#xD;
fore him high in air, and dense showers of sparks were&#xD;
borne far away upon the evening breeze.&#xD;
" Oh Lord o' massy ! Who's been and gone and done&#xD;
dat? it's de Elms! It's de old place! It's de Squire's&#xD;
house on fire! Oh de lord.; de debbil is let loose suah !"&#xD;
It was too true. The homestead of the Moneys, the&#xD;
dear old Elms, was one vast sheet of flame.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
MARK LEE, on reaching the cave in company with&#xD;
Carlton Howard, could not, although his life depended&#xD;
upon his escape, make up his mind to flee and leave her&#xD;
he loved in the power of his bitterest enemy. He knew&#xD;
his reckless character, and rightly judged that he would&#xD;
stop at nothing which might tend to serve his purposes,&#xD;
and that Rose, woman as she was, though brave and&#xD;
strong as he knew her to be, would be powerless against&#xD;
the cowardly and base designs of Miles Houghton, and&#xD;
he felt that it would be selfish and unmanly in him to&#xD;
leave her in the power of the bad man who sought his&#xD;
life, and the destruction of her peace. So refusing to lis-&#xD;
ten to the entreaties and prayers of Carlton Howard, he&#xD;
resolved to remain at the mouth of the cave, in order if&#xD;
possible to screen her from insult and from harm, even&#xD;
though his own life, should be sacrificed in the effort.&#xD;
With beating heart and burning brpin, he heard the con-&#xD;
versation which was being carried on in the cabin above,&#xD;
and, but that the door was fast, and would not yield to&#xD;
his strong efforts to force it open, he would have sprung&#xD;
from his concealment, and struck the villain in whose&#xD;
power she was, dead at his feet.. At last the trap moved&#xD;
upon its hinges, and he was about to spring upward, when&#xD;
Carlton Howard seized him by the arm, and without say-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF '61.&#xD;
&#xD;
39&#xD;
&#xD;
ing a word, pulled him back, and, as we have seen, leaped&#xD;
into the room. In a moment he reappeared, followed by&#xD;
Rose, who, almost fainting, was received in the arms of&#xD;
her lover, who stood below.&#xD;
Come! Not a moment is to be lost," le said, lifting&#xD;
the fiuinting girl from the ground, and bearing her along'.&#xD;
" We must hasten to the mouth of the cave. The distance&#xD;
is not great, and if we are speedy, we may escape them&#xD;
yet!"&#xD;
"Let me lead the way," urged Howard, "I have ex-&#xD;
plored this cave before ; not far from here there is an-&#xD;
other passage, .which leads to the right, and, where we&#xD;
may secure a hiding place until these miscreants have&#xD;
passed, should they be so bold as to follow us."&#xD;
So saying, he pushed by Mark Lee, and led the way.&#xD;
Rose, meanwhile, recovering her strength, insisted upon&#xD;
being allowed to follow unsupported, and placing herself&#xD;
immediately in the rear of Howard, proceeded with them&#xD;
on their dark and uncertain journey. They had gone but a&#xD;
short distance, when it became evident that they were fol&#xD;
lowed. The voice of Miles Houghton could be distinctly&#xD;
heard urging his men to hasten on, and the .fugitives&#xD;
quickened their steps and fled along with as much speed&#xD;
as the rough and narrow passage made possible. But&#xD;
fast as they went, the pursuers were evidently gaining on&#xD;
them. They could hear the sound of their heavy footsteps,&#xD;
and distinguish their loud curses, as they stumbled over&#xD;
the various impediments which obstructed their path.&#xD;
The passage was quite dark, not a gleam of light was to&#xD;
be seen, and with all their exertions their progress was&#xD;
necessarily slow.&#xD;
At last the voice of Houghton sounded but a few steps&#xD;

behind them. Rose's heart beat with fear, and she almost&#xD;
sank to the ground, but she spoke not, and summoning all&#xD;
her energies, exerted herself to the utmost to keep up&#xD;
with Howard, who still led the way.&#xD;
The slight distance which intervened between the pur-&#xD;
suers and the pursued, decreased at every step. It seem-&#xD;
ed impossible that they should escalpe when all of a sud-&#xD;
den she felt herself seized by Howard and borne on one&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"To the right! Quick !" exclaimed Howard, in a whis-&#xD;
per scarcely above his breath. Mark heard it, and turn-&#xD;
ing quickly; to the right, he left the direct course of the&#xD;
fissure, and in a moment all three were standing, with&#xD;
suppressed breath, and palpitating hearts, in a side pas.&#xD;
sage, which led from the main opening,in pitch darkness,&#xD;
but secure for the present, at least, for they had hardly&#xD;
stopped, ere they heard the footsteps and voices of their&#xD;
pursuers, as they passed the spot where they had turned&#xD;
off, and continued on their errand.&#xD;
As their voices died away in the distance, and nothing&#xD;
but a confused rumble indicated their presence in the&#xD;
cave, Mark said in a low tone, "Now is ourKtime! Let&#xD;
us proceed at once to the mouth of the cave ; they will&#xD;
not imagine that they have passed us, and will, of course,&#xD;
proceed directly to the Elms. Come, dear Rose, lean up-&#xD;
on me. There is hope yet !"&#xD;
"You are right," responded Howard, "and the sooner&#xD;
we follow them the better. But see! There is a light in&#xD;
the main passage ! I see the glimmer of it upon a point&#xD;
of rock before us. Hush! Do not stir upon your lives.'&#xD;
I will make a reconnoisance !"&#xD;
So saying, he left them, and cautiously and noiselessly&#xD;
&#xD;
pursuing his way, soon reached the main passage, when&#xD;
peering cautiously around, he discovered a bright light at&#xD;
the upper end of the cave, and could distinctly hear the&#xD;
crackling of flames, and perceive fragments of burning&#xD;
wood fall into the cave from the aperture above.&#xD;
"Haste, haste !" he cried, guessing at the true cause of&#xD;
that which he saw. "Haste! they have fired the cabin,&#xD;
and retreat is impossible. We must gain the outlet or&#xD;
we are lost!"&#xD;
Mark and Rose instn.ntly obeyed the summons, and&#xD;
guided by the light, which now lit up nearly the whole&#xD;
length of the narrow passage, tiy reached the end of the&#xD;
branch in a moment, and the three swiftly fled along, di-&#xD;
recting their footsteps by the red glare of the flames at&#xD;
the upper end.&#xD;
Meeting with no further obstruction, they shortly near-&#xD;
ed the mouth of the cave, when, to their surprise, they&#xD;
saw the glare -of another fire, which threw a lurid light&#xD;
directly in front of tlhemn.&#xD;
"Great heavens !" exclaimed Mark, " they have fired&#xD;
the cave at the other end likewise! Ah, I see their plan ;&#xD;
they have suspected the trick we have played them, and&#xD;
are resolved to keep us here until the morrow, when, the&#xD;
fires having been extinguished, they will resume the&#xD;
search. There is to hope now ! Let us sell our lives a,&#xD;
dearly as we can !&#xD;
"Do not despair !" said Howard, encouragingly, "let&#xD;
us go on as far as we can, at anyrate. Heaven may yet&#xD;

" Courage, dear Rose, courage !" said Mark, addressing&#xD;
the almost exhausted girl at his side, "Howard is right!&#xD;

"Do not fear for me," she replied, in a low voice, and&#xD;
clinging closer to his side. "I am but a woman, and am&#xD;
weak as one, but my soul is strong, and I do not despair..&#xD;
Whate'er your fate may be, I will share it by your side.&#xD;
If they drag you from me, I will die ere I submit to aught&#xD;
to tinge my cheek with shame, or make me less worthy of&#xD;
your love."&#xD;
"Bravely spoken!" said Howard, cheeringly. "But&#xD;
see, we are wrong! The fire is not at the mouth of the&#xD;
cave, it is-"&#xD;
"Alas! it is the Elms," exclaimed Rose, as they stood&#xD;
the next moment at the outlet. "The vile wretches have&#xD;
fired the old homestead. Oh, my father! my poor fa-&#xD;
ther !"&#xD;
As the te'ible truth rushed upon her, the overwhelm-&#xD;
ing anxiety which filled her heart, overcame her, and the&#xD;
unhappy girl fell senseless to the earth.&#xD;
Mark knelt for a moment by her side, and lifting her&#xD;
lovely head upon his knee, imprinted a long, long kiss up-&#xD;
oi her cold lips; then turning to Howard, he exclaimed&#xD;
in a voice choked with emotion : " Heed me no longer;&#xD;
my course is taken. Guard her and protect her as you&#xD;
would your life! My presence will only expose her to&#xD;
more danger." Then, laying the still senseless girl upon&#xD;
the green sod, he rose, and shaking Howard by the hand,&#xD;
drew a pistol from his belt, and before his friend could&#xD;
utter a word, he bounded away.&#xD;
On he sped on the wings of the wind, straight in the&#xD;
direction of the burning house, the .flames from which&#xD;
were rising high up in the heavens, lighting up the land-&#xD;
ecape for miles around, and casting a lurid glow upon&#xD;
every object.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Mark proceeded, he began to hear the shouts of&#xD;
men, and when he had reached within a few hundred&#xD;
yards of the house, he perceived by the light of the flames&#xD;
the troop of horsemen commanded by Houghton, grouped&#xD;
around the burning pile, and heard their shouts of joy, as,&#xD;
one after the other, the rafters yielded to the flames, and&#xD;
fell into the seething cauldron below.&#xD;
"The poor old man '1" he murmured to himself. "The&#xD;
wretches will murder him! Pray heaven I be not too&#xD;
late "&#xD;
A few moments more brought him to the burning house.&#xD;
For a second he paused, not knowing exactly what to do,&#xD;
and during that second he felt his arm grasped as in a&#xD;
vice,  ie turned and saw Cupid, his eyes streaming with&#xD;
tears, and his face wearing an expression of the greatest&#xD;
anxiety.&#xD;
"For God's sake, mass'r, do something quick! Poor&#xD;
old mass'r's in the house. I know he is. I habn't done&#xD;
seen him- anywhere around."&#xD;
" It was a cussed shame not to find out if the old maa&#xD;
was safe. When the row commenced, he fled to the cel-&#xD;
lar, and has not been seen since," Mark heard a man,&#xD;
standing near him, exclaim.&#xD;
"Do you hear dat, mass'r ?  Come on, I know de way,&#xD;
urged Cupid, quietly. " But for de Lord's sake, don't let&#xD;
nobody see you, or you're a goner."&#xD;
Thus advised, Mark, still wearing the spectacles which.&#xD;
he had received from Howard, pulled his slouched hat fur-&#xD;
ther down over his face, and strode rapidly away. Press-&#xD;
ing through the crowd of people, and past the rebel horse-&#xD;
men, who were gathered in knots in every direction, Cu-&#xD;
pid led the way to the rear of the house, which was comn-&#xD;

THE REFUGEES; On,&#xD;
&#xD;
pletely deserted, to a low door fitted into the stone foun-&#xD;
lation, against which both Mark and himself threw them-&#xD;
selves at once, but their united strength proved inadequate&#xD;
to burst it open. Finding their efforts useless, Mark's&#xD;
eves lit upon a neighboring wood-pile, and rushing to the&#xD;
spot, he seized a large log, and throwing it upon his shoul.&#xD;
ders, as though it had been a feather, he ran with it to the&#xD;
door of the cellar, bringing the end of the log to bear&#xD;
with all its momentum against it. The experiment was&#xD;
successful. The door flew open, and in a moment both&#xD;
entered the cellar. It was filled with a dense, suffocating&#xD;
smoke, and not an object was discernable. As they were&#xD;
groping about, a low, dull, creaking sound from above fell&#xD;
upon their ears.&#xD;
The roof is falling in," exclaimed Mark. "We are,&#xD;
too late! too late !"&#xD;
"flurry, mass'r. and let's' get out o' dis, de ole man can't&#xD;
be here," urged Cupid.&#xD;
But at this moment Mark's foot caught upon an object&#xD;
on the ground, and stooping, hastily, his hand came in&#xD;
contact with the prostrate form of a man.&#xD;
"Thank God !" he ejaculated. He is yet alive! Help,&#xD;
Cupid, help !"&#xD;
In an instant Cupid was by his side, and together they&#xD;
raised the insensible body of the man, and bore it quick-&#xD;
ly to the open air, and some distance from the house.&#xD;
They had scarcely done so, when a heavy crash resounded&#xD;
through the air, mnyriads of sparks floated upwards, filling&#xD;
the sky with fire, and the late stately old mansion tottered&#xD;
to the earth, a heap of ruins!&#xD;
William Morley, for it was surely he, quickly revived&#xD;
under the influence of the fresh breezes of the night, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
raising his aged head, silvered with the frosts of sixty&#xD;
winters, looked wildly about him.&#xD;
He did not recognize Mark in his 'disguise, but turning&#xD;
to him, said in a faint voice:&#xD;
"Whoever you be, receive an old man's thanks! But&#xD;
where is my.daughter? Where is my dear child ?"&#xD;
"Fear not for her," replied Mark. "She is with one&#xD;
who will, I trust, protect her from all harm. Had'I not&#xD;
thought so, I should not now be here."&#xD;
"Ah, that voice!" exclaimed the old man, rising to his&#xD;
knees and gazing upon Mark. " Surely I should know it.&#xD;
Are you not-"&#xD;
"Yes, yes !" answered the young man. " But do not&#xD;
breathe my name! Come, this is no longer any place for&#xD;
you or me. Let us away at once. I will tell you all&#xD;
hereafter."&#xD;
Slowly Morley rose to his feet, and shaking the hand&#xD;
of Cupid in a grateful manner, he followed the faithful&#xD;
black, who led the way towards the barn, which stood&#xD;
but a short distance off, the old man heing supported by&#xD;
the stalwart arm of his preserver.&#xD;
They had pursued their way in silence but a few rods,&#xD;
when a party of men, coining from the front of the house,&#xD;
discovered them. By the light of the blazing ruins, the&#xD;
features of Wn. Morley were easily discernible, and the&#xD;
foremost of the party shouted:&#xD;
"Yore they are! Yere's the old man! Hurrah, we've&#xD;
got the doughface now!&#xD;
Instantly a crowd of men rushed towards them, among&#xD;
them the leader of the band of rebels, Miles Houghton.&#xD;
Flight was useless, and for an instant Mark felt his&#xD;
heart sink within him, but quickly recovering his energy&#xD;

and resolution, he looked 'about him, and discovering'&#xD;
among the promiscuous crowd, who had been attracted to&#xD;
the spot by the conflagration, several whom he knew to be&#xD;
true to the Union cause, he stopped, and drawing his pis-&#xD;
tols, and handing one to William Morley, he shouted:&#xD;
"Stand back! The first man who lays his hand upon&#xD;
these grey hairs, dies! What, are you men, that, not sat-&#xD;
isfied with the crime you have already committed, you&#xD;
should wish to dye your hellish hands in the blood of this&#xD;
poor old man ? if there is a man here who loves his Ta18&#xD;
tive land, who would frown upon rapine, arson, and on&#xD;
murder, I summon him to my side! Union men to the&#xD;
rescue!",&#xD;
By this time, every person, not belonging to the troop&#xD;
of horse, had reached the spot, and as Mark uttered the&#xD;
last words, some dozen men, all armed in various way s&#xD;
sprang to his side.&#xD;
"I know that voice !" shouted Miles loughton. "It'.&#xD;
Mark Lee's, the Abolitionist! Down with him! H&#xD;
there, men ! Mount! Charge! This way ! This way!&#xD;
As he uttered these words, he sprang forward toward&#xD;
Mark, followed by several men. He was met by those&#xD;
who had gone to the rescue of Mark,-'on hearing his p&#xD;
triotic summons, and several more, and a general mel&#xD;
ensued. Several shots were fired, and one or two fell&#xD;
both sides.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mark was forcibly seized by some one bi&#xD;
hind him and pulled to the rear of the crowd, and&#xD;
hoarse voice whispered in his ear&#xD;
." Go! You'll git chawed .up ef yer don't. You'll fin&#xD;

away like lightning."&#xD;

Mark turned and found himself in the arms of a tall,&#xD;
brawny man, whom lie had never seen before. He was&#xD;
dressed in deer-skin,-and bore a long rifle on his arm.&#xD;
Seeing Mark hesitate, he guessed the cause, and again&#xD;
spoke, in a low voice : " The old mian is there waiting.&#xD;
I gin Cupid the hint. They are off. Foller 'em quick,&#xD;
or you'll be chawed up as clean as a mushrat's tail! I'll&#xD;
kick up a shindig and keep 'em off your trail!"&#xD;
With these words he dashed forward into the front of&#xD;
the fight, and Mark, thus urged, and seeing the body of&#xD;
horse already mounted and dashing at full speed towards&#xD;
the scene of the combat, which was every moment grow-&#xD;
ing fiercer, sprang away, and turning the angle of the&#xD;
barn, which was a few steps off, was lost to sight of his&#xD;
pursuers. Then starting on a run, he reached the crib&#xD;
which stood some twenty yards from the'barn, when he&#xD;
found his strange preserver had spoken truth, for there,&#xD;
ready mounted, were the old man and Cupid.&#xD;
Without exchanging a word, Mark leaped into the sad-&#xD;
die of another horse, and calling out, "Follow  me!"&#xD;
dashed into the neighboring field, which they crossed, and&#xD;
then paused a moment on the edge of the dense woods&#xD;
which skirted it.&#xD;
The short struggle between the small party of Union-&#xD;
ists and Houghton's band, was already over, for lie heard&#xD;
the shouts of the triumphant party, and the voice of&#xD;
Houghton rose clear and distinct above the din, urging&#xD;
his men to the pursuit of the flying Union men.&#xD;
"My time will come !" Mark muttered, as urging his&#xD;
horse forward, he dashed into the wood, followed by Mor-&#xD;
ley and Cupid.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
TAE three fugitives pursued their way through the&#xD;
woods for some distance, in silence. No sounds were.&#xD;
heard save the tramp of their horses, and the distant&#xD;
shouts of the baffled rebels, who had, evidently mistaken&#xD;
the direction they had gone, and were off, on a false scent.&#xD;
At last they reached the Greenbriar river, and Mark Lee,&#xD;
who was in advance of the little party, pulled rein and&#xD;
came to a halt. The others followed his example.&#xD;
Mark was the first to speak. " We must make the best&#xD;
of our way," he said, hurriedly, " to the camp of General&#xD;
McClellan. Once within his lines, we are safe 1"&#xD;
"But Rose! What will become of her ?" asked Wil-&#xD;
liam Morley, with paternal anxiety.&#xD;
"She is under the protection of Carlton Howard," an.&#xD;
swered Mark.&#xD;
"Carlton Howard !" repeated William Morley, in sur-&#xD;
prise.&#xD;
"Yes. But for him she would now be in the power of&#xD;
that scoundrel, Miles Houghton," replied Mark, and then&#xD;
went. on to relate, in as few words as possible, the occur-&#xD;
rences which took place at Cupid's cabin.&#xD;
"But we are losing time," Mark added, as he finished&#xD;
his narration. "Let us on, once more! We must follow&#xD;
the river's course.  Come, let us forward!  We must&#xD;
&#xD;
THE REFUGEES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
reach the cabin which Howard spoke of, 'ere morning.&#xD;
Fear not, all will yet be well." " When we arrive there,&#xD;
I trust we shall find Rose and Carlton before us."&#xD;
"Say you so ?" exclaimed Morley. "Then let us lose&#xD;
no time, but onward with all speed I" and thus speaking,&#xD;
lie urged his horse forward, followed by Mark and Cupid.&#xD;
They had proceeded about a quarter of a mile, when.&#xD;
as they passed ,a sharp turn in the road, they saw, not ten&#xD;
steps in advance of them, a group of three men standing&#xD;
directly in. their path. Instantly they drew rein, and&#xD;
came to a sudden halt.&#xD;
"There are but three of them," said Mark, snatching&#xD;
his pistol from his belt, while William Morley followed&#xD;
his example, and drew theweapon which Mark had placed&#xD;
in his hand, after they had been attacked in the vicinity&#xD;
of the Elms. "There are but three, and they are on foot.&#xD;
while we are mounted. Let us make a.dash, charge upon&#xD;
them, and fire as we pass1"&#xD;
He was jest about to rush forward, when one of the&#xD;
three men advanced toward them, shouting:&#xD;
" Hold on, Squire! Hold on, Mark Lee! Don't be&#xD;
skeered ! It's only me!"&#xD;
" Who are you ?" asked Mark, leveling his pistol at the&#xD;
still advancing man. "Stand, or I fire'&#xD;
" Well, if you do, you'll let them cussed, murderin, devils&#xD;
know where you are, and you'll have the hull bilen on 'em&#xD;
down on you in the crack of a rifle. -They aint far off.&#xD;
I seed 'em pass, and they are a laying for you in the&#xD;
woods to the left."&#xD;
"Who are you? How do we know that you. are not&#xD;
of them?" asked Mark, still keeping the man covered&#xD;
with his pistol. "Answer!I&#xD;

"You're a looking for a cabin with a pine branch onto&#xD;
it, aint ye ?" asked the nian.&#xD;
" I am," answered Mark.&#xD;
Well, I'm the proprietor of that ar clearing, and-"&#xD;
"Which way does the river run ?", asked Mark, inter-&#xD;
rupting him, and thinking of Carlton Howard's instruce-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"North !" answered the man. "Put down your pistol.&#xD;
Your ears aint very, good, or you'd have know'd mo&#xD;
afore."&#xD;
By this time he had advanced close to the side of Mark,&#xD;
and by the clear light of the moon, the young man recog-&#xD;
nized in the person before him, the stranger who had so&#xD;
providentially appeared in his defence at the Elms, and&#xD;
who had directed them to the horses.&#xD;
" Why, it is-" Mark began, but William Morley inter-&#xD;
rupted him, exclaiming&#xD;
"Hank, the Hunter! I know him! A. better fellow&#xD;
never lived, or a truer man. We may trust him. He is&#xD;
a friend 1"&#xD;
" Thankee, Squire !" said the man.  "I reckon thar&#xD;
aint no treason in me, no how. But it aint no use to&#xD;
stand gabhin' here. Jest as soon as the scrimmage was&#xD;
over, inc and themt two friends o' mine, we put! I know&#xD;
the digging s pooty well, so I tuck a short cut and got here,&#xD;
half an hour before them pisonous seceshers went along.&#xD;
I watched 'em, and arter they had gone on here a piece,&#xD;
they got off their horses and began to hunt for your trail,&#xD;
which, as you hadn't made none, they didn't see. So they&#xD;
led their horses into the brush, and are a waiting till you&#xD;
come along. But we'll fix em !",&#xD;
" What must we do ?" asked William Morley, seeming&#xD;
&#xD;
to place all confidence in the shrewdness and faithfulness&#xD;
of Hank. Then turning to Mark, he said, in a low voice,&#xD;
" We cannot do better than put ourselves under his direc-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"Be it so," answered Mark. "But have you seen no-&#xD;
thing of Carlton Howard ?" lie asked of Hank, with some&#xD;
anxiety. " I had hoped he would have been here before us."&#xD;
I reckon he'll take care of himself," answered Hank.&#xD;
"You needn't be oneasy about him. But there'll be more&#xD;
o' them seceshers by here, maybe, afore long, so we paint&#xD;
got no time to lose. Follow me and don't make no noise.&#xD;
But you'd better git off your bosses. So 'light, and I'll&#xD;
lead 'em into the brush. They'll be safe there till morn-&#xD;
ing, and then I'll take care on 'em. Maybe they'll be&#xD;
needed."&#xD;
"Now look a' here," said Hank, on reappearing from&#xD;
the woods, whither he had taken the horses, " we've got&#xD;
to git the best o' them 'ere fellows some way or another,&#xD;
and if we kin git the Squire and Mr. Lee out o' their pi-&#xD;
sen clutches, without a fight, so much the better. Not&#xD;
that I keer a dried apple about 'em, but a bullet shot by a&#xD;
nigger, if it's aimed right, is jest as sure death as though&#xD;
it war fired by the best white man that ever drawed&#xD;
breath, and I don't keer about having the Squire or Mr.&#xD;
Lee sent to kingdomeome by such derned trash as these&#xD;
here pisonous rebels is. 'Sides, Gineral McClellan has&#xD;
got use for 'em. le wants jist sich men, and if I kin&#xD;
help him git 'em, count on me !"&#xD;
°' You are right, flank," answered Mark. "If we can&#xD;
avoid a conflict with these murdering and incendiary&#xD;
dogs, so much the better just now. Not that I value my&#xD;
life a pin's fee. What I am, and all I have, is my coun-&#xD;

try's, and I would preserve it for her sake, in the hope of&#xD;
doing good in her sacred cause."'&#xD;
"Dat's so !" put in Cupid, who, until now, had been a&#xD;
silent listener. " One live man is worf a dozen dead ones,&#xD;
any day. Dat's so!. If dey kills me, I aint no account,.&#xD;
no how. But if dey should kill Mass'r Lee, it 'id be&#xD;
mighty bad, suah !'&#xD;
"We must cross the river. It is no use trying to reach&#xD;
the bridge, because by going in that direction, we shall&#xD;
undoubtedly fall into the ambush whMich has been prepared&#xD;
for us," said William Morley, "and besides, it will not be&#xD;
possible to reach the camp of McClellan by the main&#xD;
road, as we should undoubtedly fall in with Garnett's men&#xD;
if we made the attempt."&#xD;
"There's only one way of circumventing the rebel&#xD;
devils," said Hank. " We must get in their rear! My&#xD;
canoe is tied on this side, not far above here. If we kin&#xD;
only reach it, it will be all right. So let's take to the&#xD;
woods, and if we're right smart, we shall git there afore&#xD;
daylight."&#xD;
"Then lead on!" exclaimed Mark. " Every moment is&#xD;
precious."&#xD;
Without saying another word, Hank struck off into the&#xD;
woods to the left, followed by Mark, William Morley,&#xD;
and Cupid, Hank's two companions bringing up the rear.&#xD;
In a short time they heard the barking of a dog, and the&#xD;
sound of voices in advance of them, and to the i-iglit.&#xD;
"That's them," said Hank, "but we are between them&#xD;
and the river, and if the dog don't scent our trail, we'll&#xD;
fool, 'em yet."&#xD;
They continued their course, cautiously, for awhile and&#xD;
theu, as they put a greater distance between themselves&#xD;

THE UNION BOYS OF '1.        -5&#xD;
and the rebels, more rapidly, until they reached the river,&#xD;
and proceeded onward on- a line parallel with its course.&#xD;
They had reached to within about two hundred yards of&#xD;
the place where Hank's canoe was tied, when they were&#xD;
startled by loud shouts behind them, accompanied by the&#xD;
yelping of a hound.&#xD;
"By the lord, they have 'got on our trail" exclaimed&#xD;
Hank. " That infernal dog has snuffed us out. There is&#xD;
no time to be lost. Follow mse !" and he started off at&#xD;
the top of his speed along the river bank, followed by the&#xD;
:est.&#xD;
The sounds grew nearer, but they had reached, the canoe.&#xD;
"Now pile in," exclaimed Hank, as he drew the heavy&#xD;
dug-out along the bank. "Get in, Squire. Get in, Mark&#xD;
Lee. And here, Cupid, you take the paddle, and paddle&#xD;
straight across. I'll hold these pups at bay. Be quick !"&#xD;
Almost as soon as the words were spoken, his direc-&#xD;
tions were obeyed, and in less time than it takes us to re-&#xD;
late it, the two fugitives and Cupid were seated in the ca-&#xD;
noe, while hank, jumping from the low bank onto a log&#xD;
which lay beside it, caught the bark by one end, and&#xD;
swinging her head round, pushed her, with lightning&#xD;
speed, from the shore, while Cupid plied his paddle with&#xD;
all his skill and strength. By this time, the crackling of&#xD;
the branches under the swift feet of the pursuers, and the&#xD;
sounds of their voices, were distinctly heard.&#xD;
Hank dropped on his knee, while his two companions&#xD;
secreted themselves behind the large sycamores, which&#xD;
grew along the river's bank. They had hardly done this,&#xD;
when a large, rough-looking dog, of the hound species,&#xD;
came up 'yelling, and made directly for flank, who, as he&#xD;
sprang towards him, seized the animal by the throat with&#xD;

one hand, and in the twinkling of an eye, plunged a large&#xD;
hunting knife deep in his breast, from which the blood&#xD;
spouted in a thick, black stream, showing that the steel&#xD;
had penetrated his heart.&#xD;
"So much for that varmint," Hank muttered, between&#xD;
his teeth, as he threw the dying brute into the river, and&#xD;
once more grasped his rifle. " Now for his master 1"&#xD;
As he spoke, two men reached the river bank, not twen-&#xD;
ty yards above him. The foremost one exclaimed:&#xD;
" There they are ! quick ! fireI"&#xD;
Simultaneously both raised their weapons, but, at the&#xD;
same moment, the sharp crack of a rifle was heard, and&#xD;
the foremost fell into the stream, with a bullet through&#xD;
his brain, directed by the unerring aim of Hank, while,&#xD;
almost at the same time, a second shot was heard, and the&#xD;
other rebel uttered a loud yell, and leaping sonie feet into&#xD;
the air, fell forward a corpse.'&#xD;
Now, then, boys, away !" shouted Hank, "before the&#xD;
others can reach here. The Squire will be safe on t'other&#xD;
side, and we out of reach ! See, they are more than half&#xD;
way! Hurrah !" he shouted at the fugitives in the, fast&#xD;
receding canoe. " Hurrah" "&#xD;
Mark waved his hat in response, which, as soon as&#xD;
Hank saw, he darted down the stream at the top of his&#xD;
speed, followed by his companions.&#xD;

noon, three persons might have been seen to emerge from&#xD;
a deep ravine in the side of a mountain, at the foot of&#xD;
which lay the town of Beverly, Virginia. All three bore&#xD;
about them the evidences of a long and tedious journey,&#xD;
and as they emerged frontn the dense undergrowth of the&#xD;
woods, and stood upon the open. ground, they looked&#xD;
about them with caution, as if in dread of some sudden&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
Th'le party consisted of Squire Morley, Mark Lee, and&#xD;
our old acquaintance, Cupid, who had thus far succeeded&#xD;
in evading the vigilance of their pursuers, and who had&#xD;
now.arrived within a short distance of the camp of Gen-&#xD;
eral McClellan.&#xD;
"iWell, dar !" exclaimed Cupid, whose courage had not&#xD;
for a moment flagged, but who had proved his devotion&#xD;
and fidelity at every step. "Well, dar! we's out o' de&#xD;
woods at anyrate, and I reckon we's all right! But, lor'&#xD;
o' massy, wot's we going to do for supper? I's orful hun-&#xD;

Nono. Cupid," answered Mark, laying his hand upon&#xD;
the darkey's shoulder, as he was about starting on his self.&#xD;
appointed mission, " we will still go on together. We&#xD;
have a friend hereabout who will supply all our wants, if&#xD;
we can only find him.&#xD;
Whom mean you?" asked William Morley.&#xD;
I mean," answered, Mark, producing from the lining&#xD;
of his hat, the letter given to him by Canton Ihoward,&#xD;
" the person to wv hom this letter is directed-one Morni&#xD;
Brice. lie is a friend to the good causle, and will Provet&#xD;

" Morris Brice !" ejaculated Cupid, interrupting Mark&#xD;
in the midst of his explanations, "I knows hih,; mass'r.&#xD;

"Stop 1" interposed Mark, " we had better keep to the&#xD;
woods, and not attempt to reach the house of Morris&#xD;
Brice before nightfall."&#xD;
" Just as you say, nass'r ; if you kin stand it I kin.&#xD;
and I'm e hungry as a woodchuck in spring ! If' I don't&#xD;
disremember, dark's a bridge across de road, on de toder&#xD;

country like a book, 'cause, afore Squire Morley owned&#xD;
nQ, I b'longed;to Major Brown, wot lives jist on de norf&#xD;
side ob de hill yonder."&#xD;
" Well, then," said Mark, "lead the way. and be cau-&#xD;
tious. Come, Mr. Morley, let us on1" the young man&#xD;
continued, as he turned- towards the father of Rose, with&#xD;
an effort to appear hopeful. " Courage! Rose is in good&#xD;
hands, and is, I dare say, by thistime within the Union&#xD;
lines, awaiting our arrival."&#xD;
." Heaven grant it may be so," replied William Morley,&#xD;
raising his eyes to heaven, as'they once more entered the&#xD;
woods and pursued their way, led by the faithful Cupid.&#xD;
A fter traversing a distance of about a mile, they cane&#xD;
to the bridge of which the black had spoken. It was a&#xD;
narrow structure, just wide enough for one of the large&#xD;
wagons of the country to cross, and spanned a rapid&#xD;
mountain stream, which at the time we speak of, was&#xD;
about twenty yards in breadth. Beyond the bridge there&#xD;
was a steep hill, on the other side of which lay a little&#xD;
hamlet, consisting of sonie half a dozen houses, and on&#xD;
each side of the stream the ground rose almost precipi-&#xD;
tously to a considerable height, so that in order to gain&#xD;
the hamlet where Brice resided. it was necessary that they&#xD;
should keep the road. According to their plans, how-&#xD;
ever, it became also necessary for them to avoid the pub-&#xD;
lic highway while light lasted, and after they had crossed&#xD;
the bridge, and proceeded up the road some fifty yards,&#xD;
Mark halted.&#xD;
" Don't stop heah, mass'r," said Cupid, with some en-&#xD;
ergy. "About twenty rods furder ahead, dere is a place&#xD;
whar we can hide for a month. Come on, quick as xou&#xD;
can, too, 'cause I tinks I hear hosses not far off.&#xD;

THE REFUGEES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Even as he spoke, the ,clattering of horses' hoofs fell&#xD;
upon their ears, and voices in conversation were distinct,&#xD;
ly audible.&#xD;
"You are right,', exclaimed Mark- "On, quick!&#xD;
Cupid did not wait to be told twice, but dashed ahead&#xD;
as fast as his deformed legs could carry him, closely fol,&#xD;
lowed by the others. When he had advanced a short dis-&#xD;
tance, he turned short to the left, beckoning to Mark and&#xD;
William Morley to follow, and led the way down the&#xD;
steep side of a gorge which set off from the road, and did&#xD;
not halt until he had reached the bottom, which was cov-&#xD;
ered with a dense growth of paw-paw trees, the heavy fo-&#xD;
liage of which would completely conceal any object under&#xD;
them from view.&#xD;
"Now, den, Mass'r Morley and Mass'r Lee, lay low,&#xD;
and de debbil hisself wouldn't find us here."&#xD;
" I hope," said Mark, as he crept into the friendly shade&#xD;
of the bushes, "that this is the last time we shall ever be&#xD;
obliged to hide in secret places like hunted wild beasts."&#xD;
"God speed the hour of our deliverance," ejaculated&#xD;
William Morley, firmly.&#xD;
While they were thus seeking shelter, a party of horse-&#xD;
men emerged from the wood, upon the road they had so&#xD;
recently left, and came to a halt a few yards in advance&#xD;
of the bridge.&#xD;
They were some twenty in number, and were led by&#xD;
Miles Houghton, who, as soon as a halt was called, beck-&#xD;
oned to his side Jem Black and Stuttering Tom, and a&#xD;
consultation took place.&#xD;
"I fear we are too late, curse upon it !" growled Miles,"&#xD;
gritting his teeth and biting his lips alternately. " I know&#xD;
they have taken this direction, and reel sure they are not&#xD;

far off. It will not do to push forward now except with&#xD;
caution, or we may come upon the cussed Federal pickets,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
" Well, let us cross the bridge at anyrate," said Jem&#xD;
Black.&#xD;
"No," answered loughton, "I reckon we'd better stay&#xD;
where we are, some of us, at any rate !"&#xD;
"I-I-I-I---" Tom Dill commenced, "I'll-"&#xD;
"I know what you are going to say," said Miles, inter-&#xD;
rupting him. "You will stay here. Is that it?"&#xD;
"T-t-t4-t-exactly !" replied Stuttering Tom, after a per-&#xD;
sistent effort, in the course of which his body  went through&#xD;
as many contortions as a dying eel. and his face assumed&#xD;
every painful expression of which the human countenance&#xD;
is capable.&#xD;
" All right! Remain here, then, while we proceed fur-&#xD;
ther on. If they do not make their appearance by dark,&#xD;
cross the bridge and join us. We shall camp on the other&#xD;
side of Hunterstown. I will leave you three men to&#xD;
keep you company 7"&#xD;
Torn nodded his assent, after a vain effort to express&#xD;
himself in words, and Miles Houghton selected the three&#xD;
who were to remain with him. Then turning to Captain&#xD;
Black, he;said, "There are but three of them-Mark&#xD;
Lee, William Morley, and that blasted imp, Cupid. Rose&#xD;
Morley is not with them, and it is not unlikely that hear-&#xD;
ing the direction her father has taken, she may attempt to&#xD;
follow. There is no way of reaching the Federal camp&#xD;
but by this road. So sloe and they must pass here if they&#xD;
have not done so already. Come, boys, forward! And&#xD;

your neglect, I'll put a bullet through your carcass!1 Do&#xD;
you understand ?&#xD;
Tom nodded his head, and began a reply in full, but be-&#xD;
fore he could manage to hitter a syllable, Hfotighton and&#xD;
the rest of the party had crossed the I)ridge.&#xD;
Ton gazed after them for a few momeiit, and various&#xD;
expressions-passed over his face as he did so. At first the&#xD;
seemed inclined to follow Miles, and actually took several&#xD;
steps with that intentions. but halting  suddenly, he turned&#xD;
quickly toward the three men, who were to be his con-&#xD;
panions, and with much difficulty said&#xD;
"I say, boys, I reckon we might as well take things&#xD;
easy. So s'pose we jist 'light and hitch our losses! Dis-&#xD;
mount !" he shouted, as he leaped off his horse, a thing&#xD;
which the others had done at least five minutes before,&#xD;
having anticipated that which he was making such despe-&#xD;
rate efforts to speak."&#xD;
They aiit likely to come along in a hurry," he wenit&#xD;
on, as they led their horses slowly in the direction of the&#xD;
woods,1" and I'll bet some of 'em licv gone over already.&#xD;
ut I reckon we'll hev to obey orders, so you jest lay low&#xD;
here, in the woods, and I'll keep a look-out, at the bridge,&#xD;
though I reckon it won't make much difference if we all&#xD;
fall asleepI!"&#xD;
So saying, Tom hitched his horse to a tree near the&#xD;
edge of the wood bordering on the road, and after seeing&#xD;
that his companions did the same, he took his ,'canteen&#xD;
from his side, and raising it to his lips, winked, and put-&#xD;
ting the mouth of the vessel to his lips, elevated the bot-&#xD;
tom in the air, keeping it in that position foi' several sec-&#xD;
onds, a low, gurgling sound, and the quick risi ngand'fall-&#xD;

r&#xD;
&#xD;
"Adam's apple," giving ocular and audible demonstration&#xD;
that the contents of the canteen were rapidly finding an&#xD;
outlet. After he had taken a long draught, he withdrew&#xD;
the vessel from his lips, and wiping the mouth of it with&#xD;
the back of his hand, uttered the word " Whisky !" as if&#xD;
it had been shot out of his mouth, and handed it to the&#xD;
irmen, who successively went through the same operation,&#xD;
on a limited scale, for, as soon as Tom thought that one&#xD;
hai taken his full share, he cut him short by snatching the&#xD;
canteen from his hands, and handing it to the next, until&#xD;
all had drank as much as he thought the circumstances of&#xD;
the case required.&#xD;
This ceremony over, Torn returned the canteen to its&#xD;
place at his side, and walked towards the bridge, stop-&#xD;
ping within about ten feet of its nearest end.&#xD;
Looking around him, lie espied a rock a short distance&#xD;
off, which he went towards, pondering on his way, and&#xD;
finally took his seat upon it.&#xD;
 This here is a nice kind o' business !" he muttered to&#xD;
himself, without the slightest hesitation observable in his&#xD;
speechi, for the most inveterate -stutterers, strange as it&#xD;
may seem, have no difficulty in uttering their thoughts&#xD;
aloud, when there is no one to look at or listen to them.&#xD;
" This is a nice kind o' bisness for a man to be in. Run-&#xD;

I was jest as well off afore seceshin, as I reckon I shall be&#xD;
arter it. Then there's the old Squire. A better man&#xD;
never gin a fellow a drink, when he was dry, and his&#xD;
latch-string was always open to me. What on airth do I&#xD;
want to interfere with hiiii for, like a mean, dogon, ornery&#xD;
cuss? It aint a goin' to do me no good, a doin' dirty&#xD;
work tor Miles Houghton! What does he care for me?&#xD;
He'll put a bullet through my carcass, will he? Well,&#xD;
maybe he will, but if he does, I'm domed.&#xD;
With this'ejaculation he rose to his feet, and poising his&#xD;
short carbine over his shoulder, he took another pull at&#xD;
his canteen, and then cutting an enormous slice of tobacco&#xD;
from a plug of that weed, which lie took from his pocket,&#xD;
put it in his mouth and chewed it savagely, walking up&#xD;
and down, meanwhile, in a state of great mental agitation.&#xD;
He continued this for some minutes. Then turning a&#xD;
quick and inquiring glance towards the spot where he had&#xD;
left the three men, he exclaimed : "I'll do it! Dogon if&#xD;
I don't! Hurrah for the Union, and Secesh go to thun-&#xD;
der ! Here goes for Gen'l McClellan and the ole flag !"&#xD;
With these words lie started across the bridge, and in a&#xD;
few minutes disappeared in the distance.&#xD;
By this time the sun was near its setting, and the shad-&#xD;
ows thrown by the tall trees by the side of the road, ex-&#xD;
tended themselves far away into the forrest. All was si-&#xD;
lent as the grave. No sound was heard save the soft,&#xD;
murmurs of the evening breeze, or the brawling of the&#xD;
stream as it went tearing over the rocks, through its nar-&#xD;
row channel.&#xD;
Suddenly, however, the men who had- been left in the&#xD;
woods by Tom Dill, and who were reclining at full length&#xD;
upon the thick moss which covered the base of the enor-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF '61.&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
mous trees which grew by the side of the wood, were&#xD;
aroused from their lethargy by the sound of voices, and&#xD;
rising quickly, cast their eyes up the road in the direc-&#xD;
tion from which the sounds proceeded.&#xD;
After waiting a few morhents, two persons came into&#xD;
view, riding side by side, and engaged in conversation.&#xD;
The one who rode upon the left was a man in the full&#xD;
flush of early manhood. He was dressed plainly, but a&#xD;
brace of pistols bristled at his waist, and over his shoul-&#xD;
der he carried a long rifle. On his right rode a fair&#xD;
young girl, whose lovely 'features were marked'-by' a shade&#xD;
of deep anxiety, and whose beautiful eyes were red as if&#xD;
with recent weeping. Their horses moved slowly, as if&#xD;
they had been over-ridden, and the general appearance of&#xD;
the travelers indicated a long and painful journey.&#xD;
'Hush !" exclaimed one of Houghton's men, in a low&#xD;
voice. "That's them!"&#xD;
"Them? Who ?" asked one of his companions.&#xD;
"Why, Squire Morley's daughter and Carl ton Hotwrd.&#xD;
I wonder where on earth Tom Dill has gone? 'I saw h m&#xD;
go on t'other side of the bridge. Let's lay low a niy e,&#xD;
any way, until they get past."&#xD;
By this time the two persons had ridden to within a&#xD;
short distance of where the men lay concealed, so that&#xD;
their conversation could be distinctly heard.&#xD;
" We are nearly at our journey's end, for to day, at any-&#xD;
rate," said Carlton Howard to Rose, for the man had&#xD;
been right in his declaration of their identity. " We&#xD;
have scarcely a mile to go. Summon all your energies,&#xD;
then, Miss Morley, and I trust, ere morning, to be able&#xD;
to restore you to those you love."&#xD;
" Alas 1" replied the young girl, "I fear I have miscat&#xD;

culated my power. I have scarcely strength to retain my&#xD;
place upon this poor jae&#xD;
and the excitement of the past few days, added to the hor.&#xD;
rible uncertainty I feel as regardS my father, and-"&#xD;
I can well understand all you feel," interrupted Carl-&#xD;
ton Howard," and wonder that you have borne up against&#xD;
such an accumulation of misfortunes in the manner you&#xD;
have. But one effort more, and soon, I trust, all will be&#xD;
well. Come-courage! courage ! we have but to pass&#xD;
yonder hill.&#xD;
By the time the last words were uttered, Carlton and&#xD;
his fair charge had passed out of hearing, whereupon the&#xD;
man who had first spoken, rose, and going to his horse,&#xD;
mounted with all speed. The other two followed his ex-&#xD;
ample.&#xD;
We must head them off!" he exclaimed, before they&#xD;
can cross the bridge. But don't fire, unless he is spunky&#xD;
and won't gin in. Come! "&#xD;
Instantly the speaker led the way, in a diagonal direc-&#xD;
tion towards the bridge, which Rose and her protector&#xD;
were slowly approaching, with the view of intercepting&#xD;
them before they reached it, but they had proceeded but a&#xD;
short distance, when the quick ear of howard detected&#xD;
the sound of their horses' feet, and reining his own horse&#xD;
suddenly, lie caught at the same time the bridle of the an-&#xD;
imal ridden by Rose. ,&#xD;
Thlis did not escape the observation of Iloughton's men',&#xD;
and the foremost one now seeing the impossibility of' get-&#xD;
ting any closer without being discovered, put spurs to his&#xD;
horse and dashed at once towards the road, followed by&#xD;
his companions, and in a moment the three were dashing&#xD;
up the highway, in full view of Howard and his charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF 'Ol.            65&#xD;
"By heaven !" he exclaimed, "they are a part of Hough.&#xD;
ton's men, and there are three of them! What's to be&#xD;
done ?"&#xD;
He did not hesitate long, but at once urged on his horse&#xD;
and that of Rose; but the jaded beasts could not be in-&#xD;
duced to move beyond a walk. Flight was therefore use-&#xD;
less, and by this time the leading one of the three men&#xD;
was within a few yards of him.&#xD;
" Halt !" cried the man, riding up. "Halt and give an&#xD;
account of yourselves."&#xD;
Quick as thought, Mark drew a pistol from his belt,&#xD;
and leveling it quickly at the man, fired. With a loud&#xD;
exclamation of pain, the man instantly fell back in his&#xD;
saddle, bathed in blood, for the fatal bullet had pierced&#xD;
his body, while Mark, pointing his long rifle at the others'&#xD;
who were approaching, cried out:- "Keep back, you&#xD;
murdering hounds! Keep back! Halt, I say! Move&#xD;
one step further and I fire!"&#xD;
The sight.of their companion weltering in his bloods&#xD;
and the determined air of Carlton Howard, had the de&#xD;
sired effect upon the two men, for they both reined up&#xD;
their horses and stood motionless in ,the road, not more&#xD;
than ten yards off.&#xD;
"If I can but gain five minutes time," said Howard to&#xD;
the almost fainting girl, "Hank and his party will be&#xD;
here. So for heaven's sake push on! I will defend their&#xD;
passage of the bridge with my life. Fly and save your-&#xD;
self. I believe the villains are unarmed, save the sabres&#xD;
which they carry, and I am a match for a dozen such.&#xD;
Fly and stop at the second house on the right, after you&#xD;
have passed the other bridge, not a mile from here. There&#xD;
you are safe, and will, I hope, find your father and Mark&#xD;
Lee! By God's help I'll join you soon. Now go !"&#xD;

THE REFUGEES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus urged, the young girl once more turned her horse's&#xD;
head up the road, and exclaiming, in a voice overflowing&#xD;
with emotion, "' Heaven preserve you, Mr. Howard !" she&#xD;
urged her horse forward, this time with more success, and&#xD;
in a short time had crossed the bridge, and commenced&#xD;
the ascent of the hill. She had not proceeded far, how-&#xD;
ever, before her progress was arrested by the appearance&#xD;
of an armed man, who dashed suddenly out of the woods&#xD;
to the left, and standing directly in the road, made signs&#xD;
for her to halt. She obeyed instantly, trembling from&#xD;
head to foot. -The man came towards her at once, his&#xD;
face distorted to a fearful degree, while lie uttered a series&#xD;
of unintelligible sounds.&#xD;
Her nervousness, the excitement she had already under-&#xD;
gone, her sense of danger, the bloody sight she had just,&#xD;
witnessed, and the horrible contortions of the man's face,&#xD;
all tended to destroy her presence of mind, and uttering&#xD;
a shrill, piercing scream, the reins dropped from her&#xD;
hands, and crying, ,"Help! Mark! Mark!" in a loud&#xD;
voice, she fell back fainting.&#xD;
"Blast it, she's swounded !" exclaimed Tom Dill, for it&#xD;
was he, and now that there was no one to listen to him,&#xD;
he found no difficulty in speaking. " What did she want&#xD;
to do that for?  I warn't agoin to hurt her."  But seeing&#xD;
that she was quite insensible, and was about falling from&#xD;
her horse, Stuttering Tom gently lifted her to the ground,&#xD;
and carried her to the road side, where he at once com-&#xD;
menced some rude attempts at restoring her to conscious-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
It was not yet quite dark, and in. the dusk of the even-&#xD;
ing Carlton Howard had been enabled to, observe all that,&#xD;
took place. He still held the two men at bay, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNION BOYS OF '61.&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
horse ridden by the man who had fallen, being freed from&#xD;
his rider, had approached to within a few feet of where&#xD;
howard stood. His resolution was taken in a moment.&#xD;
Quick as thought he leaped from the back of the animal&#xD;
he had been seated upon, and seizing the rebel's horse by&#xD;
the bridle, vaulted upon his back, and dashed off, at full&#xD;
speed, across the bridge, to the rescue of Rose, supposing,&#xD;
of course, that she had fallen into the hands of her en-&#xD;
eny. 'He had no sooner done thus, ere the two horsemen,&#xD;
taking heart of grace at his disappearance, followed in&#xD;
pursuit.&#xD;
As Stuttering Tom heard the clatter of the horse's&#xD;
hoofs, he looked up, and seeing Howard approaching, and&#xD;
the other two pursuing, he left his charge and fled precip-&#xD;
itately into the woods, and again took a course towards&#xD;
the bridge, with the intention of intercepting his former&#xD;
companions. This lie succeeded in doing by running into&#xD;
the middle of the road, and by signs ordering them to&#xD;
halt, which they did, and a conversation ensued between&#xD;
them, in the course of which he learned the fate of the&#xD;
man who had been foremost in the pursuit of Howard.&#xD;
Meanwhile Howard reached the side of Rose Morley,&#xD;
and. was about dismounting from his horse, when he was&#xD;
surprised by the sudden appearance of Mark Lee, from&#xD;
the woods on the left, followed by Cupid and William&#xD;
Morley.&#xD;
"That voice! those cries !" exclaimed Mark, in great&#xD;
excitement.  "Surely my ears did not deceive me! I&#xD;
heard my name called, and cries for help by one-ah !" he&#xD;
exclaimed, for the first time catching sight of Howard,&#xD;
but not recognizing him, "-this time we meet man to man,"&#xD;
and drawing his pistol, he rushed towards him.&#xD;

"HoldI".do you not know me?" exclaimed Howard,&#xD;
hastily jumping from his horse and raising his hand  "It&#xD;
is I, Carlton Howard! Put up your weapon, man, and&#xD;
hasten to Rose, who has fainted !"&#xD;
"6 Great heaven!" exclaimed Mark. seeing the senseless&#xD;
form of poor Rose, and rushing to her side. " What does&#xD;
this mean? and why did Rose utter those cries ?"&#xD;
"I will explain some other time," replied Howard.&#xD;
Just now we have little time for talking. See to the girl&#xD;
while I look after these scoundrels. Follow me, Cupid.&#xD;
Quick !" exclaimed Carlton Howard, as he once more&#xD;
mounted his horse and dashed down the road.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
NIGHT had now fallen, but the moon, which was about&#xD;
half full, shed her brilliant light upon the scene, and by her&#xD;
beams Howard saw the three men standing in the middle&#xD;
of the road, some distance front the bridge. As he rode&#xD;
rapidly forward, his rifle poised upon his arm, ready for&#xD;
instant use, he was somewhat surprised to see Stuttering&#xD;
Tomt approach him, making signs of a pacific character,&#xD;
but suspecting it to be a ruse, he drew up his rifle and:&#xD;
brought it t?,,bear upon him. At this, Tom threw up&#xD;
both hands, and then stopped and laid his short carbine&#xD;
upon the ground, in token of submission, whereupon&#xD;
Howard again rested his rifle across his saddle-bow, and&#xD;
riding up to him, demanded to know what he meant.&#xD;
Ton's body instantly began to go through a thousand&#xD;
contortions, but he managed to stammer out, "A-all&#xD;
right, M-m-ister toward. I have concluded Secesh won't&#xD;
pay and I've joined your side. I was running avay, when&#xD;
I diskivered Miss Morley going over the hill, and I was&#xD;
afeared she would meet the Capt'n, who is coming this&#xD;
'ere way, and 1 stopped her to tell her she'd be tuck, sure,&#xD;
ef she kep on, when she up and f-f-fainted. Jist as I was&#xD;
agoin to help her, I saw you a coining, and as I know'd&#xD;
you'd shoot me afore I could git out a word, I run."&#xD;

&#xD;
THE REFUGEES ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
All this was said in a very low tone, and with great&#xD;
difficulty.&#xD;
"How do I know you are not lying ?" asked Howard,&#xD;
suspiciously, and putting his hand upon one of the pistols&#xD;
which he carried at his waist. "This may be but an ex-&#xD;
cuse to detain me here, until the rest of your murdering&#xD;
band come up."&#xD;
By this time Cupid had reached the side of Howard,&#xD;
and stood, pistol in hand, ready to go in on the slightest.&#xD;
signal from the Unionist.&#xD;
"Don't talk so loud, stammered Torn. "Them 'ere fel-&#xD;
lers will hear, and though they're the biggest cowalds I&#xD;
ever see, it's just as well to keep 'em in the dark. I'll&#xD;
tell you how you kin find out whether I'm true grit dir&#xD;
not!"&#xD;
"How?" asked Howard.&#xD;
" Why, jist make b'lieve you've gin in. You kin keep&#xD;
your rifle, and go down to whar they be, and help me tie&#xD;
'em up to a tree in the woods yonder. The blamed mean&#xD;
cusses aint worth killin', no how, and I kinder don't like&#xD;
to put a bullet through 'em in cold blood, but if we don't&#xD;
do something, they'll dig off and have the Capt'n after&#xD;
you in a twinkling."&#xD;
"Do you mean what you say ?" asked Howard, not yet&#xD;
convinced of the sincerity of the new convert.&#xD;
"It's as true as heaven !" answered Tom, as earnestly&#xD;
as his impediment would permit him to speak. "I've&#xD;
been a mean, ornery cuss, I know, I've drank a heap o'&#xD;
whisky, and bin in a heap o' fights, but Tom Dill won't&#xD;
lie, nor steal. I'm white, I am, and if you'll help me, we&#xD;
kin fix them 'ere fellows in two minutes."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"I'll trust you, come on !" said Howard. "How shall&#xD;
it be done?"&#xD;
"Just you and Cupid follow me as if you'd gin up, and&#xD;
wanted to settle terms. That'll put 'em off their guard,&#xD;
and when we getalongside on 'em, you jist take one, and&#xD;
leave tother to nie.&#xD;
" Go on, then," said Howard, "but mind, on the first&#xD;
suspicion that enters my head, that you are playing false,&#xD;
I'll put the contents of this rifle into your brain."&#xD;
"All right!" responded Tom, and picking up his car-&#xD;
bine, he moved slowly forward towards the men. The&#xD;
moment they reached the two horsemen, Tom signed to&#xD;
Howard to pass quietly behind them, and then gave the&#xD;
order for them to dismount.&#xD;
" What for ?" asked one of them.&#xD;
"None' o' your business. Git off o' them ar losses !"&#xD;
replied Tom, in his impetuosity forgetting to stammer.&#xD;
"That's my order, so git off !&#xD;
The men did not move, but murmured something in a&#xD;
low voice, upon which, without uttering a word, Tom&#xD;
dropped his carbine, and motioning Cupid to seize the&#xD;
horse by the bridle, lie sprang upon the neck of the beast,&#xD;
with the agility of a cat, and seizing the man by the&#xD;
throat with one hand, while he wrested the sword from his&#xD;
grasp with the other, threw him violently to the ground.&#xD;
At the same moment, Howard, drawing a pistol, and put-&#xD;
ting it to the head of the other trooper, said in a firm&#xD;
voice, "Take your choice, throw down your sword and&#xD;
yield yourself a prisoner, or die where you sit. You&#xD;
have not more than two seconds to make up your mind !"&#xD;
The man turned his hedd quickly, and brought his ear&#xD;
in contact with the muzzle of the pistol; then turning in&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7514-00000036"/>&#xD;
the other direction, and seeing the fate of his companion&#xD;
who lay stunned upon the earth, he threw down his&#xD;
sword, and turning to Howard, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Don't shoot! I gin in."&#xD;
"A precious pair !" muttered Howard, contemptuously.&#xD;
Then in a firm tone he added : "Dismount, you cowardly&#xD;
ruffian!" dismount at once!"&#xD;
The man obeyed, and in a few moments the arms of&#xD;
both the men were firmly pinioned behind them, and they&#xD;
were led by Tom and Howard, into the woods, Cupid re-&#xD;
inaining behind to take care of the horses.&#xD;
After binding the two specimens of Virginia chivalry&#xD;
to a tree, and securely gagging them, Howard and Tom&#xD;
returned to the road.&#xD;
"Well, I recon you believe I'm sound now. don't you ?"&#xD;
asked Tom, after going through the customary gyrations&#xD;
of body, and contortions of facial muscles, "I told you&#xD;
Tom Dill wouldn't lie !"&#xD;
"You are an honest fellow !" exclaimed Howard, giv-&#xD;
ing him his hand, "and well out of such, bad company.&#xD;
But you mentioned something just now about the return&#xD;
of the Captain. Do you mean Houghton ?"&#xD;
"He went by here not more'n an hour ago," said Cupid.&#xD;
"I seed him from de side of de road, whar I was a look.&#xD;
ing out."&#xD;
" He reckoned you'd gone ahead, or he allowed ef you&#xD;
hadn't, Mister Lee had," stuttered Tom, "and he left me&#xD;
at the otherside of the bridge, with them ar fellers, to&#xD;
keep a lookout for you and the Squire's daarter. He'll&#xD;
be back afore long, I reckon. So we'd better get out of&#xD;
the way, without you think it's worth while to hold on&#xD;
herse and gin him a brtish.. He threatened to put a bullet&#xD;

through my head this afternoon, and I wouldn't mind get-&#xD;
ting first shot !"&#xD;
" How many men has he with him ?" asked Howard.&#xD;
"Well, nigh on to twenty, I reckon."&#xD;
"Armed ?"&#xD;
" Right smart on 'em !"&#xD;
"With rifles ?"&#xD;
"No, right smart o' swords and shot-guns-sorne car-&#xD;
bines.'&#xD;
"Did he promise to return?''&#xD;
" Wal, no, he allowed he'd camflp other side o' Bar Run,&#xD;
beyond Iluntersville, but the shot you fired. and my not&#xD;
getting back, may make him think;sornethin's going on."&#xD;
Howard paused a nioment in reflection, and then mut-&#xD;
tered to himself, " Where can flank linger? He should&#xD;
have been here before this."  Then turning to Tom Dill,&#xD;
he said, "Is there any way by which we can pass round&#xD;
their camp ?"&#xD;
"I reckon I know a trail through the woods here,&#xD;
which leads to Carrick's Ford ; by taking that, we can&#xD;
cut over and come out on the Beverly Road, if we don't&#xD;
meet with none o' the pickets."&#xD;
We will run the risk of that. For various reasons,"&#xD;
Howard continued, "I would. rather not risk an encounter&#xD;
with the scoundrels to-night. So let us take these horses,&#xD;
join our friends, and make for the ford with all speed.&#xD;
"My horse is tother side o' the bridge," said Tom," I&#xD;
reckon I'd better git him, and thar's your hoss down tha'&#xD;
in the holler. Horseflesh aint to be throw'd away these&#xD;
times."&#xD;
"You.are right," answered Howard. " I will lead these&#xD;
horses up the road. Cupid can go and secure muy horse&#xD;

while you regain your own- Hasten, I will await you&#xD;
return above." With this, Howard took the reins from&#xD;
Cupid, and leading the horses, st rted to rejoin Mark and&#xD;
the others whom he had left some Xninutes since.&#xD;
He found Rose entirely restored to consciousness, an&#xD;
ledning' her aching head upon the shoulder of her father&#xD;
who sat by her side, pouring words of comfort into he&#xD;
ear, and uttering thanks to heaven for her restoration t&#xD;
him, while Mary stood b)y, her hand clasped in his, an(&#xD;
his face expressing every mark of joy at finding the ob&#xD;
ject of his love once more.&#xD;
As soon as Mark became aware of the presence o&#xD;
Howard, he gently released the loving hand he had held&#xD;
andproffering his own to Howard, said, with much feel&#xD;
ing, "I can never repay the debt I owe you. Be assure&#xD;
that gratitude and devotion deeper than ever man felt&#xD;
will dwell in my heart for ever !"&#xD;
" He deserves it all," said Rose, partly rising, and als&#xD;
extending her hand to the Unionist. " He has been&#xD;
friend, protector, comforter, and brother to me, dea&#xD;
1ark 1".&#xD;
"An old man's blessing be upon you, for being the in&#xD;
strunient in the hands of heaven, in the restoration of m3&#xD;
child to me!" said William Morley, rising and placing hit&#xD;
hand on Howard's shoulder.&#xD;
"I have done no more," said Howard, modestly, "thai&#xD;
any man would have done under tihe same circumstances&#xD;
The pleasure I feel in seeing you so happy, amply repay&#xD;
me for all. .But," lie continued, " we must remain here n(&#xD;

be useless now to attempt to reach the house of Brice, and&#xD;
as we have a new recruit in the person of a deserter from&#xD;
Houghton's troop, who knows a by-road to Carrick's Ford,&#xD;
we had better mount at once and start. The distance is&#xD;
not great, and if we usedispatch, we may reach thd Fed-&#xD;
eral lines ere sunrise."&#xD;
r     "I fear that Rose-" Mark began.&#xD;
"Fear not for me. I am quite strong again," inter-&#xD;
rupted the fair girl, rising, and endeavoring to throw&#xD;
off the air of fatigue, which was too plainly visible.&#xD;
"I will not be a burden or a hindrance to you. I am&#xD;
quite refreshed, and shall be able to keep up with the best&#xD;
of you."&#xD;
"Then let us mount at once," said Mark, and to-morrow&#xD;
a long rest will compensate for all the dangers you have&#xD;
undergone, for all the fatigues you have endured."&#xD;
By this time Torn and Cupid had reached the party,&#xD;
o- and after assisting Rose to mount, Mark was about to be-&#xD;
a.stride one of the horses of the captured troopers, the&#xD;
r   other having been already appropriated by William Mor-&#xD;
ley, when Cupid, who was not provided for, and who had&#xD;
gone higher up the hill, came rushing towards them, ex-&#xD;
y   claiming:&#xD;
''"Hi, hi! Mass'r Lee! Here dey comes! Here comes&#xD;

SAt the same moment, the sound of horses dashing over&#xD;
o-the bridge, came from the right, and Carlton Howar d,&#xD;

To the hollow !" said Mark Lee. " Quick !" confiding&#xD;
Rose to the arms of her father. "Away, there is no time&#xD;
for words. Bless you, Rose! If we do not meet again&#xD;
remember I shall die in a good cause."&#xD;
",God bless you, Mark !" Rose ejaculated in a trembling&#xD;
voice. " Do your duty, and leave me to the care bf hea-&#xD;

" Away at once !" urged Howard, for by this time Hank&#xD;
and his party were within a few yards of them. " We&#xD;
shall make short work of it, I iope! To horse! Mark&#xD;
Lee, to horse !"&#xD;
Thus urged, Rose and. her father once more sought the&#xD;
shelter of the wood, and Mark. mounting his horse rode&#xD;
to the side of Howard.&#xD;
In a moment the foremost of the approaching party&#xD;
rode up.'&#xD;
"Who goes there ?" exclaimed Howard.&#xD;
" Who wants to know ?" asked a tall man, dressed in&#xD;
deer skin, and carrying a long rifle on his arm, and who&#xD;
was evidently the leader of the pai'ty. "Is that you,&#xD;
Cap'n Howard ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Howard, " and you are Hank Red.&#xD;
fuld !"&#xD;
"That's me, sartain !" he cried, riding up to Howard,&#xD;
and calling upon his men to halt.&#xD;
"You are later than I expected," said Howard, quickly,&#xD;
"but there' is no time for explanation now. Houghton&#xD;
and his party are approaching from the Beverly road,?&#xD;
&#xD;
pursued, as I hear, by the Unionists. We must give hin&#xD;
a warm reception !"&#xD;
No words can express the delight with which Hank and&#xD;
his hardy men received this intelligence, and in a few mo-&#xD;
ments Howard had placed the forces at his command, in&#xD;
position to receive the advancing foe, who were rapidly&#xD;
coming on, little dreaming of the preparations going on&#xD;
in their behalf.&#xD;
" When I give the word, charge !" said Howard, in a&#xD;
low voice, as he turned to see that each man was ready.&#xD;
They had not long to wait, for even as lie spoke, the&#xD;
foremost of the rebels caine into sight over the brow of&#xD;
the hill. The clank of their horses' hoofs was plainly&#xD;
discernable, and ioughton's voice was heard urging on&#xD;
his men, while in the far distance could be heard the&#xD;
shouts of their pursuers and the roll of drums.&#xD;
With beating hearts and firm lips the -little party of&#xD;
Unionists waited their appearance until they were scairce-&#xD;
ly twenty yards off, when Howard gave the word to&#xD;
charge, at the same time dashing forward, accompanied&#xD;
by Mark Lee.&#xD;
On they went, that small but compact and unflinching&#xD;
band, and in a moment the melee commenced.&#xD;
The assault was terrific. Both parties fired simulta-&#xD;
neously, and several of Hough ton's party fell from their&#xD;
saddles. Shrieks, oaths, and groans filled the air, but&#xD;
loud above the din sounded the voice of Mark Lee.&#xD;
Down with them!1" lie cried. " Union and victory!"&#xD;
As he uttered these words, Miles Houghton recognized&#xD;
him, and springmig for ward, seized him by the throat with&#xD;
his left hand, while with his right lie drew a long bowie&#xD;
knife, and raising it high above his head, exclaimed :&#xD;

&#xD;
" Ha! ha !" Mark Lee, we meet at last. You shall no&#xD;
escape me now&#xD;
With the grasp of a giant Mark seized his uplifted arm,&#xD;
and endeavored to wrest the knife from his grasp, but&#xD;
Hioughton still kept his fingers' tightly clasped to the&#xD;
throat of his victim, and Mark began to feel his strength&#xD;
giving way, when he saw a dark object descend q'ckIy&#xD;
before his eyes, and in an instant the hold of Hou htou&#xD;
relaxed, and Mark was free.&#xD;
"Golly! I fixed him dat time !" exclaimed Cupid, who,&#xD;
armed with a heavy club, was laying about him like a&#xD;
fiend. "I reckon dat ar arm won't be much use for&#xD;
awhile, anyhow. Give it to him, Mass'r !"&#xD;
This was addressed to Mark Lee, who, the moment he&#xD;
was free, rushed upon his antagonist, but Houghton, find-&#xD;
ing'himself disabled, did not wait for his near approach,&#xD;
but turned and fled, calling out to his men to follow him.&#xD;
A Babel-like confusion, followed. The rebels, such o&#xD;
them as were not shot down, or otherwise put hors de&#xD;
combat, fled in all directions, when Houghton, finding him&#xD;
self left alone, once more turned, and called, "Shame, yo&#xD;
infernal cowards! What! do you desert me now? B&#xD;
God, I will not go until I pay some part' of the debt&#xD;
owe 1" and dashing forward with desperation, he made ft&#xD;
Mark Lee.&#xD;
As he did so, Mark slowly raised the pistol which hb&#xD;
carried in his hand, and fired. With a loud yell, th&#xD;
rebel bounded from his saddle, and the next moment fe&#xD;
to the earth a corpse.&#xD;
"Bravely done !" exclaimed Howard. That shot di&#xD;
good service. It has rid the country of one of the blac1&#xD;
est hearted villains and traitors that ever cursed it. Noi&#xD;

to the woods, brave boys, and cut off the retreat of these&#xD;
flying cowards. Look to Rose and her father," he said to&#xD;
Mark, "and follow on."&#xD;
Mark did not hesitate a moment, but instantly dis-&#xD;
mounting, and giving his horse in charge of Cupid, made&#xD;
for the friendly dell, in which Rose and her father had&#xD;
taken shelter, and in a few moments the two lovers were&#xD;
locked in each other's arms.&#xD;
To place the young girl and her father upon a couple&#xD;
of the horses which had been taken by the Unionists, was&#xD;
the work of a moment, and the whole party started in the&#xD;
direction of Huntersville. Just as they reached the vil-&#xD;
lage. they were met by Morris Brice, who had been on the&#xD;
lookout, and Rose and her father, now quite exhausted by&#xD;
the excitement and fatigue of the past three days, were&#xD;
left in the charge of his family, while Mark Lee, Howard,&#xD;
and Hank, and his brave men, with the exception of one&#xD;
who had fallen in the late skirmish, and two who had&#xD;
been wounded, proceeded to meet the advancing Unionists&#xD;
who, Brice informed them, wcre rapidly approaching by&#xD;
way of the Beverly road, over Laurel Hill.&#xD;
There had been a brilliant skirmish at Buchanan, the&#xD;
day before, in which a party of rebels had been defeated&#xD;
and scattered, and Gen. McClellan had immediately ad-&#xD;
vanced with his whole force to dislodge the rebel force at&#xD;
Laurel Hill.&#xD;
The events of the next three days are matters of his-&#xD;
tory. The brilliant battle of Rich Mountain, the defeat&#xD;
of the rebels at St. George, and the subsequent occupa-&#xD;
tion of Beverly by the brave McClellan and his victorious&#xD;
forces, are among the most brilliant of all the achieve-&#xD;
meats which marked the campaign in Western Virginia.&#xD;

In all these victories Mark Lee and Carlton Howard&#xD;
took part, and were distinguished as the bravest among&#xD;
the brave. At the end of the campaign, and after Wes-&#xD;
tern Virginia had been freed from the presence of the&#xD;
traitor troops by the Union forces, both Mark Lee and&#xD;
howard were chosen to represent the Loyalists of the&#xD;
State in the Convention at Wheeling, from which Mark&#xD;
returned covered with honors to claim his young bride.&#xD;
On the death of Miles Houghton, his father disappeared&#xD;
from the country, and the estate being declared confis-&#xD;
cated, was purchased by Win. Morley, where he now re-&#xD;
sides temporarily, until the mansion at the Elms shall be&#xD;
rebuilt.&#xD;
Shortly after his marriage, Mark Lee and howard&#xD;
were appointed Colonels in the Union army, and are now&#xD;
battling for the Constitution and the laws, under the glo-&#xD;
rious old flag.&#xD;
Cupid still lives, and is known among the Union boys&#xD;
as the bravest among all the " contrabands" in camp, and&#xD;
it is the boast of Colonel Lee that he has the ugliest and&#xD;
best servant in the army.&#xD;
Hank, the hunter, is captain of a company of sharp&#xD;
shooters, raised by himself among the mountains, and to&#xD;
him and his brave woodsmen " many a good tall fellow"&#xD;
in the rebel ranks, is indebted for his quietus.&#xD;
Those who desire to follow his fortunes, and become ac-&#xD;
quainted with his various adventures and achievements,&#xD;
