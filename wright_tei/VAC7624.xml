CHAPTER I.&#xD;
DUNBAR, THE SCOUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
ARD byForty Fort,&#xD;
on the Susquehan-&#xD;
na river, upon a&#xD;
balmy morning in&#xD;
the summer of 1778,&#xD;
a group of persons,&#xD;
consisting of men&#xD;
of various  ages,&#xD;
stood  discoursing&#xD;
earnestly. The sub-&#xD;
ject under consid-&#xD;
eration  was  ob-&#xD;
viously of much&#xD;
importance,   for&#xD;
every face wore a serious expression, and every&#xD;
word that was uttered appeared to be carefully&#xD;
weighed and its exact import understood. The&#xD;
individuals to whom the reader's attention is&#xD;
cited, were anxiously debating the best means&#xD;
Jof defending Wyoming Valley, in case that arch&#xD;
tory, Col. John Butler, should lead against their&#xD;
little settlement the malcontents of the Six Na-&#xD;
tions, together with no less merciless foes, with&#xD;
whiter faces but blacker hearts, to- be found all&#xD;
about them and among them-loyalists.. There&#xD;
were a few persons in the valley who affected to&#xD;
&#xD;
discredit entirely the startling rumors that were&#xD;
daily reaching them through various channels.&#xD;
Of this class were the Lanaways, the Winter-&#xD;
moots, and the Secards-names well remem-&#xD;
bered in the history of beautiful Wyoming.&#xD;
By the joint efforts of the residents, several&#xD;
forts had been erected, viz., Ogden, Wyoming,&#xD;
Durkee, Jenkins and Fort Forty. Just above&#xD;
the latter, Fort Wintermoot had been erected.-by&#xD;
the influence of the family bearing that name.&#xD;
Besides these fortifications, or stockades, there&#xD;
was a small fort on Monockonock Island.&#xD;
The reader unacquainted with the condition of&#xD;
Wyoming at that time, might be led to form the&#xD;
erroneous conclusion that the place was very&#xD;
well prepared for an attack and would repel a&#xD;
large force of the enemy with comparative ease.&#xD;
But this was far from being the case ; for nearly&#xD;
all the fighting men had been drafted for the&#xD;
continental army, and the real strength of the&#xD;
valley was at that time defending other portions&#xD;
of the country, hile Congress was, apparently,&#xD;
blind to the danger that menaced the settlements&#xD;
of the Susquehanna. With a few exceptions,&#xD;
but an inconsiderable number of old men, and&#xD;
mere youths, remained to ward off the blow that&#xD;

clouded brow and compressed lips moved from&#xD;
the spot, and was soon lost to view in the moun-&#xD;
tains.a&#xD;
"Re knows very well there's false-hearted&#xD;
ones at Wyoming," observed Dunbar.&#xD;
"I am not so much acquainted in the settle-&#xD;
ment as you are, but I fear that your suspicions&#xD;
are not unfounded," was Montour's answer.&#xD;
" Well, let us go up the river a few miles and&#xD;
see what's goin' on," continued the other. " I've&#xD;
been too much in the woods, and seen too-many&#xD;
of the ways of the red pien to be deceived by&#xD;
'em; and as for Butler's Royal Greens they're&#xD;
worse than the savages, although they aint so&#xD;
common, perhaps, and can't follow a trail so&#xD;
well."&#xD;
Montour made no reply, and the two shoul-&#xD;
dered their rifles, descended the rock, and fol-&#xD;
lowed the general course of the Susquehanna.&#xD;
Having reached the spot which they had evi-&#xD;
dently been seeking-which was a solitary place&#xD;
in a thicket of birch-they kindled a fire and&#xD;
Waited the approach of night with obvious im-&#xD;
patience.&#xD;
As soon as the evening shadow' began to fall,&#xD;
the blazing fagots were extinguished, the brands&#xD;
scattered, and leaves carefully thrown over the&#xD;
spot where they had burned. Having examined&#xD;
their rifles to be assured that they were ready for&#xD;
distant use, Montour and Dunbar took a posi&#xD;
tion nearer the river, concealing themselves be-&#xD;
neath a dense cluster of wil4 grape vines' that&#xD;
grew among the rank alders on the bank. Thus&#xD;
hidden they remained motionless until the moon&#xD;
came up and the stars twinkled merrily.  Th&#xD;
evening was far advanced when a slight sound&#xD;
reached the ears of Dunbar; it was the light&#xD;
regular dip of a paddle.&#xD;
Touching Montour upon the arm to attrac&#xD;
his attention, the hunter pointed up the river&#xD;
A canoe containing bitt a single figure was glid&#xD;
ing toward them.&#xD;
" It is a Mohawk," whispered the young man&#xD;
"Yes, and he must die," replied Dunbar&#xD;
calmly.&#xD;
"I see no help for it; if he lives, our plo&#xD;
fails," rejoined Montour.&#xD;
The hunter made no answer, and the birche&#xD;
bark drew near. When it was within rifle di&#xD;
tance, Dunbar took deliberate. aim and fire&#xD;
The Indian dropped the paddle, and Montou&#xD;
throwing off his hunting frock plunged into th&#xD;
stream andswam toward the canoe, which whe&#xD;
he had reached, he directed to the bank pushing&#xD;
&#xD;
it before him With his hand. Bythe time he had&#xD;
accomplished the task, the Mohawk, who had&#xD;
fallen forward upon his face, had revived and be-&#xD;
gan to make efforts to get upon his feet, but&#xD;
was too much exhausted from loss of blood to&#xD;
do so. Dunbar drew the little vessel from the&#xD;
water, and then directed his attention toward the&#xD;
wounded savage.&#xD;
The'- benignant rays of the moon streamed&#xD;
down upon the singular scene. The Mohawk&#xD;
laid in the canoe regarding his conquerors with&#xD;
stern composure. His eyes, though fast losing&#xD;
their lucidity, still gleamed with the dark vin-&#xD;
dictiveness of his race. Death could rob him of&#xD;
physical power and life, but could not change&#xD;
his nature.&#xD;
"Redskin, you have been betrayed," said&#xD;
Dunbar.,&#xD;
The words of the backwoodsman caused the&#xD;
native to start and cast an inquiring glance at&#xD;
the speaker.&#xD;
" Betrayed !" he added, without changing his&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
"By whom ?" asked the sufferer, instinctively&#xD;
feeling for the handle of his knife.&#xD;
-"You came to meet Lanaway ." rejoined&#xD;
Dunbar, watching  the countenance of the&#xD;
Mohawk.&#xD;
The latter was silent for a moment as if decid-&#xD;
ing how far he might honorably divulge his&#xD;
*purpose.&#xD;
" The pale faces were always traitors !" he&#xD;
exclaimed, with suppressed and husky voice.&#xD;
" You were a fool to trust to white men who&#xD;
e betray their own brethren.. Did you think they&#xD;
I would keep better faith with you than with us ?"&#xD;
continued Dunbar.&#xD;
" Pale faces, you are right ; he who is false to&#xD;
t his own people will be false to' others," replied&#xD;
the Indian, somewhat less sternly.&#xD;
- " Of course you are old enough to know bet.&#xD;
ter than to trust yourself with such hypocritical&#xD;
. renegades. Shame on you, redskin, to be caught&#xD;
, in the company of John Butler and his band of&#xD;
tory cut-throats ! A, man as will fight agin his&#xD;

L GREENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
16                             THE ROYA&#xD;
eyes of Devron or the searching gaze of Ellen.&#xD;
Waves of agitating thought appeared to sweep&#xD;
rapidly across the troubled waters of his mind&#xD;
and disturb painfully its quietude. His- usually&#xD;
impassive features changed 'color, alternately&#xD;
from a deep flush to a livid paleness. Mr. Dev-&#xD;
ron did not seem to be sensible of the perturba-&#xD;
tion of his neighbor; but Ellen, more watchful,&#xD;
had noted the, evidences of the internal struggle,&#xD;
and drew her own inferences from the same.&#xD;
"1I dare say you are correct," said Lanaway,&#xD;
at length.' "When the time that' will test our&#xD;
principles arrives (as it will shortly), I trust I&#xD;
shall be found on the right side, doing my duty&#xD;
like a brave man."&#xD;
Although he attempted to say these words&#xD;
with his usual reckless air, his voice more than&#xD;
once faltered, and that life-giving energy which&#xD;
should have marked and lent force to them, was&#xD;
wholly wanting. Raising his eyes, he met those&#xD;
of Ellen fixed upon him with an earnestness&#xD;
which he could not brook with that calmness of&#xD;
demeanor which he wished to exhibit in her&#xD;
presence ; so taking asomewhat hurried leave he&#xD;
left the cabin.&#xD;
His departure was followed by a long and&#xD;
constrained silence between the father and daugh-&#xD;
ter. Both gave indications of dissatisfaction&#xD;
and uneasiness ; Ellen was the first to speak.&#xD;
"Father," she said, laying her hand upon his&#xD;
arm, " did it ever occur to you that Mr. Lanaway&#xD;
is not a true friend to the cause which you have&#xD;
so nobly and fearlessly espoused ?"&#xD;
" It is not best to entertain such suspicions,&#xD;
child," he replied, evasively, as it appeared to&#xD;
the fair questioner.&#xD;
"But his manner-did you not observe it?"&#xD;
" No, no I I saw nothing. Don't cherish such&#xD;
unkindly thoughts, Ellen; you do him injus-&#xD;
tice."&#xD;
" What portend his vague hints about secur-&#xD;
ing otur safety? What means has he of doing&#xD;
what you cannot just as well accomplish? If he&#xD;
has power which you have not, where did he&#xD;
get it ? Why this mystery?" she continued,&#xD;
with increasing earnestness.&#xD;
" Would you distrust your lover, Ellen?" ask-&#xD;
ed her father, somewhat sternly.&#xD;
"I care not that he should be laver of mine,"&#xD;
was the firm reply.&#xD;
"Be cautious, my daughter-=d not ,sacrifice&#xD;
your maiden feelings too much to patriotism,"&#xD;
rejoined Devron, smiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Little affection have I for James Lanaway,"&#xD;
resumed Ellen.&#xD;
" Strange that youthful damsels will never&#xD;
frankly. confess the tenderness of their truant&#xD;
thoughts ; but so it has ever been from the first&#xD;
female to the last," was the bantering rejoinder.&#xD;
Miss Devron reiterated her assurances, but&#xD;
they apparently had no convincing force over&#xD;
the mind of her parent, and for the time the sub-&#xD;
ject was dropped.&#xD;
On the second evening after tlhis interview,&#xD;
the fears of the settlers were still more excited&#xD;
by an incident which will now be briefly related.;&#xD;
Mr. Devron and Ellen were seated in the com-&#xD;
fortable little room where' we have just left&#xD;
them, when Cato, the colored servant, came run-&#xD;
ning in, crying in a disturbed voice :&#xD;
" Massa Devron, dars troubil down below,&#xD;
sartin I"&#xD;
Both father and daughter followed him into&#xD;
the open air, to discover the object of his fears.&#xD;
" Which way, Cato ?" asked Ellen.&#xD;
"Right dar ; don't yer see de fire "&#xD;
Miss Devron-glanced in the direction named&#xD;
and perceived a fierce jet of flame bursting&#xD;
through the roof of a cabin on the opposite side&#xD;
of the river.&#xD;
"De Ingins hab come, Missy Ellen, and-dat's&#xD;
de game dey's at," added Cato.&#xD;
" True, too true, Cato I" exclaimed Miss&#xD;
Devron..&#xD;
"Worse than savages, perhaps !" said Devron.&#xD;

"Very probable; but we shall learn soon&#xD;

" Jes let 'em come ober de riber, dat's all I"&#xD;

" Heaven forbid, Cato !" rejoined Ellen.&#xD;
" What should we do ?"&#xD;
" Do, Missy Ellen? I bring out my doubil-&#xD;

and for your shiny locks, too," said Cato.&#xD;
During this time not a single shot had been&#xD;
heard, or other sound indicating that the marau-&#xD;
ders were meeting with any resistance.&#xD;
"I cannot account for this," said Mr. Dev-&#xD;

had scarcely touched her, when he was hurled to&#xD;
the ground by a blow.&#xD;
"Deluded and inhuman men! will ye murder,&#xD;
young maidens, and have go ;pity for a father&#xD;
with gray hairs I" cried he, who had thus sud-&#xD;
denly come to the rescue.&#xD;
"Back, back, ye unmannerly hounds I" cried&#xD;
another voice, and the tall form of Dunbar, the&#xD;
hunter, was seenlooking through-the sights of&#xD;
his long rifle.&#xD;
The young man who had sprang to the relief&#xD;
of Ellen, caught her in his arms, and bore her&#xD;
swiftlytoward Hudson's cabin, while the loyal-&#xD;
ists, not knowing how many new enemies might&#xD;
be at hand, retreated. 'Follow Montour," said&#xD;
Dunbar to Devron and Cato ; "follow him to&#xD;
the cabin as fast as you can, and I'll be there as&#xD;
soon as you."&#xD;
Without waiting a second bidding, they obey-&#xD;
ed, and in a few minutes the parties were safely&#xD;
at Hudson's.&#xD;
Great was. the revulsion of feeling that took&#xD;
place in the bosom of Ellen Devron. In a par.&#xD;
tially unconscious state she was borne within the&#xD;
friendly walls of the: cabin. Her 'first - inquiry&#xD;
was for her father, when, she Ws assured by her&#xD;
preserler that he was close at hand.. She ven-&#xD;
tred toexamine the features of Montour mote&#xD;
closely, and then emembered that he was the&#xD;
same whom she had seen with Dunbar on many&#xD;
occasions, but with whom she-had neverexehang&#xD;
' d a word. The discovery did not sceem..i&#xD;
disagreeable one, for her delivererhad a manl3&#xD;
beauty of face and form, not to be slighted b3&#xD;
even bashful dansels or coy maidens.. She at&#xD;
tempted, to speak,some fitting words of thanks&#xD;
but though her voice failed, her embarrtssmen&#xD;
spoke more eloquently to Montour than all sh&#xD;
could have said. Her modest confusion wa&#xD;
relieved by the entrance of her father and Cato&#xD;
followed by Dunbar.&#xD;
'f Sad times .these," said' Mr, Hudson, wh&#xD;
entered the dwelling at the same moment, a&#xD;
companied by a young man whose name ha&#xD;
once before been mentioned-Edward Gaston.&#xD;
Sad-indeed I" returned Devron. "But y&#xD;
&#xD;
Ought not to complain," he{added, glancing at&#xD;
Ellen, "when a life so precious has been spared&#xD;
to me."&#xD;
" You are right welcome to the shelter of my&#xD;
roof," Mr. Hudson rejoined, "and if attacked,&#xD;
we will mutually do our best to baffle the designs&#xD;
of our insatiable enemies. Ah, here is DunbarI&#xD;
I am glad to see you, sir, and your friend also ;&#xD;
for the very fact of his being with you, vouches&#xD;
for his integrity. Neighbors, make yourselves&#xD;
at home under myhumble roof, and, if, after we&#xD;
have done our duty like true men, the worst&#xD;
comes of it, we will share one common fate, re-&#xD;
signing ourselves as much as is in poor human&#xD;
nature, to the will of God."&#xD;
At that instant an exclamation from Dunbar&#xD;
attracted the attention of the parties. Devron,&#xD;
looking from the window in-the direction of his&#xD;
cabin, saw a few puffs of smoke arising from the&#xD;
roof, speedily followed by a flickering lisrmae&#xD;
which rapidly-increased in strength and bril-&#xD;
liancy until it east a red glare upon the sur.&#xD;
rounding scenery.&#xD;
Ellen sighed, and tears moistened her cheeks,&#xD;
when she perceived the home of her childhood&#xD;
crumbling to ashes and melting from her sight.&#xD;
"Our cabin is large enough to shelter you,"&#xD;
said Elvira Hudson, -taking Ellen" by the Jaind&#xD;
in akindly manner. " When peace once more&#xD;
visits the valley, it will be an'easy matter for our&#xD;
- good neighbors to erect another dwelling, and I&#xD;
a am sute it will give them pleasure to do so."&#xD;
y " No doubt, my friend, no doubt; but many a,&#xD;
y dark night of danger will .pass before-the dayof&#xD;
L peace dawns upon us," replied Miss:Devron.&#xD;
, " When that time comes, there'll be manydas&#xD;
t is alive and well now, wont need no airthly&#xD;
e homes," said Dunbar, solemnly.&#xD;
as Expectingfarther molestation, Hudson and his.&#xD;
, friends (like many others) kept ,anxious vigils&#xD;
during that long night, but no attack wasnhude.&#xD;
o In the morning no traces of the tories could be&#xD;
e- found, save in the blackened ruins of the-two&#xD;
s cabins, and spots of blood where the conflict'had&#xD;
taken place; the bodies of the'slain'having been&#xD;
et removed.&#xD;

returned.&#xD;
"As they advance, I think I can see another&#xD;
captive, and I reallybelieve it is a black," added&#xD;
Roland.&#xD;
-   "Jest look sharp and see if you know 'em."&#xD;
"Devron and the faithful Cato I" exclaimed&#xD;
the young mai.           '&#xD;
"That's truer than I wish it was, Montour,"&#xD;
rejoined Dunbar, mournfully.&#xD;
" The fatal apathy of the people of Wyoming&#xD;
makes my blood boil with indignation. They,&#xD;
take nomeasures to secure their gafety,'and seem&#xD;
to invite the vengeance of the Iroquois and the&#xD;
Royal Greens 1" said Roland, in a low voice.&#xD;
"Ah, yes! them's been my feelin's for many a&#xD;
long day, and if we fail to enlist the Delawares&#xD;
in our favor, we can do but little to savb ,he&#xD;
valley."&#xD;
"W e an at least warn them of the treachery&#xD;
of Lanaway and Wintermoot," resumed Roland.,&#xD;
" We can, but they're so awfully infatuated,&#xD;
as 'twere, by the artifices of the-loyaliss, that,&#xD;
it's ten to one if the greater part on 'em wouldn't&#xD;
disbelieve it entirely, and give us the cold shoul-&#xD;
det for our pains: See ! what a fair chance for&#xD;
a shot-eight of'em in all."&#xD;
-We must do something for the rescue of the&#xD;
prisoners, Dunbar. You know what tory mercy&#xD;
is;,and my'conscience will reproach ree if I do&#xD;
not make an effort in behalf of those brave men,"&#xD;
replied Roland.&#xD;
"I'm willing' to try, though the odds are agi&#xD;
us ; but in sich a case I'm never backward, for&#xD;
it's uly natur, as I may say, to be doing' sunthin!&#xD;
in that-way.",&#xD;
The parties'moved on and when opposite the&#xD;
place where our friends were so securely shelter-&#xD;
ed, made a halt. It was obvious that they had&#xD;
had a weary ,night's work of it, and were glad to&#xD;
rest.,They sat down upon the ground and held&#xD;
a hurried consultation.&#xD;
" Well, sergeant, whatedo youthink the chances&#xD;
are of getting off, out of their reach I" asked&#xD;
one of them.&#xD;
" That depends altogether upon carcum-&#xD;
stances. If some men as I knew were there, we&#xD;
should have been overhauled afore this time,"&#xD;
was the reply.      -&#xD;
"That's SergeantNorton-a dyed inthe wool&#xD;
tory  I used to know him well," whispered the&#xD;
scout to Roland.&#xD;
" Who might them ' be ?"   continued the&#xD;
questioner.              --&#xD;

L GREENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dunbar, the scout is one-a parseverin',&#xD;
sharp-eyed, dangerous chap as goes everywhere,&#xD;
and turns up allers when he aint wanted," added&#xD;
the sergeant.&#xD;
" There's a compliment for you," said Roland,&#xD;
touching the hunter upon his arm.&#xD;
"Listen, and you'll hear more of 'em pretty&#xD;
likely," was the response.&#xD;
"Dunbar," repeated the first speaker, mu-&#xD;
singly, "it appears to me that I've cheered of&#xD;
him. Doesn't he shoot a rifle beyond all&#xD;
account?"&#xD;
S"He'll bring down a feller as fur as he can&#xD;
see him. Jest give him a glimpse of a red-coat,&#xD;
or a red face; and it don't matter a farthing's&#xD;
worth about the distance-his long rifle cracks,&#xD;
and it's all over."&#xD;
"Don't be a talkin' in that way, Sergeant&#xD;
Norton, for I declare you make me feel nervous,"&#xD;
rejoined the other.&#xD;
"T he last chap as spoke is a corporal. He&#xD;
once lived down at the lower end of the valley&#xD;
near Naticoke," said Dunbar to his friend.&#xD;
"If that's the man you fear the i most," said&#xD;
another, " let me tell you, lads, teat he's been&#xD;
hangin' about Wyoming several days ; I had the&#xD;
information from Lanaway himself. And there's&#xD;
another one with him of the same kind of stuff-&#xD;
as keen on the trail as a nateral-born Ingin, and&#xD;
a dreadful hater of tories. It was he that res-&#xD;
cued the gal t'other night."&#xD;
"If that's the case, we've got no time to lose,&#xD;
for Dunbar is as fleet as a deer and will beat&#xD;
Captain Brant himself on the trail,"&#xD;
" They say," .resumed the other, "that this&#xD;
Montour is his equal in daring and all-kinds of&#xD;
woodcraft and .warfare.  You see he's got a&#xD;
sprinklin' of Ingin blood, and when you come to&#xD;
mix the white and red: together, it makes 'em&#xD;
oncommon smart. Why, it's been said that he&#xD;
even visited Brant's camp in disguise 1"&#xD;
"Come, lads, this is no time for gossip--.&#xD;
there's work afore us, and we must do it.' We&#xD;
had orders you know, not to hurt the old man ;&#xD;
but as for the nigger there was no particular&#xD;
word given about him, and I s'pose we might as&#xD;
well dispose of him."&#xD;
"Perhaps he'll jine us," said the corporal.&#xD;
" We'll try him, though I should be loth to&#xD;
take the critter's word for it. Look here, you&#xD;
darkey!' do you want to jine the Royal Greens ?"&#xD;
added Norton, raising his voice.I&#xD;

" Come on-give me your hand-ah, haven't&#xD;
 the use of'em-well, your arm will do as Wel,"&#xD;
added the scout, and putting forth his brawny&#xD;
liad, he grasped Devron's arm and assisted him&#xD;
to clamber into the assure.&#xD;
"NoW you'e saib," said Montout'.&#xD;
"God be praised I" exclaimed Devton.&#xD;
"This I reckon is- rather a lucky dream-&#xD;

--now look for sport, for he'll rare right up,&#xD;
lavin' sich an awful  temper, when he's mad,&#xD;

As the chivalric sergeant drew near the spot&#xD;
where. he had left Devron; he had a.vague' sus-&#xD;
picion that he had departed. without a formal&#xD;
leave-taking. He quickened his pace, expecting&#xD;
to-see him not far off, for he believed that a&#xD;
minutebad scarcely elapsed since he saw him.&#xD;
He looked in vain for his prisoner, and commene-&#xD;
ed running about in a fever, of perplexity.&#xD;
" No hidin'-none of your rebel tricks 1" he&#xD;
cried, thinking it possible that Devron was con-&#xD;
cealed-somewhere in the vicinity. 4'Come out&#xD;
-I see you-what's the use of foolin' !" he add-&#xD;
ed, in a very mild and persuasive way for him&#xD;
but nobody " came out."&#xD;
"A good deal you seehim I" muttered Dun-&#xD;
bar, setting histeeth hard together. "Ifit wasn't&#xD;

The officer holding such a responsible place in&#xD;
tle Royal Greens, now waxed exceedingly wroth&#xD;
and -said a number of hard things, which it&#xD;
*ould lot edify the reader to hear. Very nat-&#xD;
urally supposing,,that if Devron had.attevnpted,&#xD;
to escape, he, would as a matter of policy run&#xD;
in a direction wholly opposite to that whither the&#xD;
pursuit now tended, he accordingly acted upon&#xD;
the thought and set off in t1hat course.&#xD;
One by one the pursuers came back, until all&#xD;
had returned but, the sergeant; but Cato was&#xD;
not to be seem&#xD;
" I wonder where the sergeant is," said the&#xD;
corporal, who was pretty well blown.&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder if Devron had given him&#xD;
the slip," rejoinedone of his comrades. This&#xD;
reasonable conclusion appeared to carry general&#xD;
conictidn ; which wan reduced to absolute cer-&#xD;
tainty, when that officer at length' made his ad-&#xD;

After taking a hearty drink i'om their canteens&#xD;
-which contained something-stronger than lem-&#xD;
onade-this disappointed fraction of the Royal&#xD;
Greens resumed' their march toward the encamp-&#xD;
ment of Butler, far up the river.&#xD;
When they had passed from sight, Mr. Dev-&#xD;
ron began to express his sense of obligation, but&#xD;
was cut-short by theblunt but honest scout, who&#xD;
refused to listen to anything of that description.&#xD;
"If I hadn't other things on\ my hands, I&#xD;
should foller them chaps and cut 'em off one by&#xD;
one-; but it's time for me to go somewhere else,"'&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
" To see the Delaware chief?" asked Roland,&#xD;
in a low voice.&#xD;
Dunbar nodded assent and motioned to the&#xD;
former to follow him to one side, that he might&#xD;
confer with him' privately.&#xD;
"I'm goin' to find the Delaware chief, accord-&#xD;
in' to our original purpose, and see if we've any-&#xD;
thing to hope in that quarter. As Mr. Devron&#xD;
isn't perhaps so used to travelling the woods as&#xD;
we are, I reckon it wouldbe best for you to show&#xD;
him the shortest way to the valley, in order that&#xD;
he may get back to his daughter to relieve her-&#xD;
fears, which are naterallyexcited on his account.&#xD;
If you feel disposed,. I'd recommend yon to go&#xD;
with him a considerable distance, and if the idea&#xD;
suits you, come back to this spot and wait&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
To this proposition, Montour readily assent-&#xD;
ed, and soon set off with Mr. Devron In si-&#xD;
lence he led the way until his companion began&#xD;
of his own accord to converse.&#xD;
" If I am any judge of such matters, you are&#xD;
quite well versed in the mysteries of woudcraft,"&#xD;
he observed.&#xD;
" I think- I have some knowledge of forest&#xD;
life, sir," replied Roland, modestly.&#xD;
"And yet you arequite young ?"&#xD;
"Not so old but^I hope to be older," heit&#xD;
joined, with a smile.&#xD;
"I presume you are somewhat acquainted&#xD;
with the arts of border warfare ?" resumed&#xD;
Devron.&#xD;
"1Too much, sir, too much acquainted with&#xD;
the awful details of war," was the reply.&#xD;
"And so am I, young man. Our own valley&#xD;
presents many melancholy evidences of savage&#xD;
maraud and partial malignity," Devron added.&#xD;
"As young as I may seem to be, I have had&#xD;

own right-to let Lawson into the secret.'&#xD;
Our hero was inclined to cultivate friends&#xD;
relations with the stranger, although his freedom&#xD;
of speech had not altogether comported wit&#xD;
his own independent, notions. He was muc&#xD;
perplexed at many things Lawson had said, an&#xD;
in vain sought for some clue to the source of hi&#xD;
information. He had noticed that hisaccent wa&#xD;
foreign, and'he tried to remember ifhe had sees&#xD;
asperson resembling him in that distant country&#xD;
where he had received his education, but could&#xD;
recall no very definite impressions of such a cir&#xD;
cumstance. He had seen many amen there, witi&#xD;
beardsand voices like his, but he could fix hi&#xD;
mind on no-one with whom he could thpn iden&#xD;
tify the stranger. The more he pondered, th&#xD;
more indistinct and ~disconnected became hi&#xD;
ideas, and he attempted to place his thoughts on&#xD;
another-' theme.  Re. ha4 partially succeeded&#xD;
when the warning of Lawson, that he-should not&#xD;
pass two nights in the same place, suddenly oc-&#xD;
curred to him. Had he enemies who followed&#xD;
him, so closely as that warning would seem to&#xD;
indicate? .From certain events that had. trans-&#xD;
pired recently, he feared-that there was too much&#xD;
truth in the supposition ; but the cavern was so&#xD;
curiously hidden from observation, that. Mon-&#xD;
tour felt secure, though not at his ease.&#xD;
Feeling strongly impelled to go from. the&#xD;
vault, he obeyed the impulse. As soon as he&#xD;
reached the rift, he looked for the-stranger,:but&#xD;
he had gone. With his rifle upon his arm, Ro-&#xD;
land slowly threaded the forest. The moon had&#xD;
arisen and cast a mellow light over the wild&#xD;
scenery. The hour and the solitude were in&#xD;
keeping with Montour's mood. His soul held&#xD;
communion with nature, and he forgot in that&#xD;
high and ennobling converse, that he was aldne.&#xD;
"This wilderness," he murmured, "is my&#xD;
home.   The broad sky, studded- with silver&#xD;
stars, is my roof; the vistas in the overhanging&#xD;
boughs are my windows; the clouds are my&#xD;
curtains ; the leafy earth my couch. Here I&#xD;
seem to hear the very respirations of the mighty&#xD;
Maker, and my dreams teem with the sweet&#xD;
imagery caught from his own sacred sanctuary--&#xD;
the wide courts of nature. With one being to&#xD;
love, methinks, I could contentedly_ dwell here&#xD;
forever, wandering up and down amid the wild&#xD;
and fascinating scenery which the great Artist&#xD;
has painted with consummate skill upon the&#xD;
canvass of- earth and sky."&#xD;

d They were moving up the river, and Roland&#xD;
- soon saw their dusky forms passing, one after&#xD;
h the other, in the same tracks.&#xD;
s   "A female captive !" he muttered to himself,&#xD;
- as the figure of a woman glided along, preceded'&#xD;
e and followed by savages. Montour watched the&#xD;
s train of warriors -until they had swept from his&#xD;
sight, and then, with nimble feet hurried toward&#xD;
the rift. He entered the fissure and pronounced&#xD;
t the name of the scout. Receiving no answer, he&#xD;
Srepeated it in a louder voice, but with no better&#xD;
success.&#xD;
"'This is unfortunate !" he exclaimed. ".I&#xD;
never desired his friendly aid more than now.&#xD;
What shall I do? Wait, I cannot-I am too&#xD;
. impatient to be on the trail. And yet what can&#xD;
my single arm do ? I feel the need of food, too,&#xD;
for I am faint with long fasting."&#xD;
"Montour ! are you here?" said a voice just&#xD;
outside the rift, which he knew to be Dunbar's.&#xD;
"Ah, DunbarI am glad to hear your voice I"&#xD;
returned our hero, earnestly.&#xD;
"And I rather think you'll be glad to taste&#xD;
some of the venison I've brought with me, too.&#xD;
How fares it with you ?" inquired the scout, en-&#xD;
tering the cavern.&#xD;
"A war-party of the Six Nations has just&#xD;
passed up the -river with a captive," rejoined&#xD;
Roland, quickly.&#xD;
" Who have the heathen got now ?"&#xD;
" One whom you know, the half-breed", Mon-&#xD;
tour replied, speaking with hesitancy.&#xD;
"Then they have been hovering about the&#xD;
village of the Delawares."&#xD;
"Quite evidently from the fact that they have&#xD;
taken such a captive."&#xD;
"I have seen the-chief of the Delawares, and&#xD;
now I remember that he spoke of danger from&#xD;
the Six Nations; but the Redskins are so figura-&#xD;
tive in their speech, as 'twere, that you can't&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
tnza TIAIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wa now pass over an interval of several days.&#xD;
our present scene opens at'Wyoming Valley,&#xD;
Lanaway and Wintermoot were earnestly con-&#xD;
versing in the, forest just above the fort bearing&#xD;
the name of the latter.&#xD;
"It is evident," said Lanaway, "that we are&#xD;
suspected of being more friendly to the loyalists&#xD;
than what we profess to be. I doubt whetherewe&#xD;
shall be'safe much longer in the valley."&#xD;
"There can be no question of that. Many of&#xD;
our rebel neighbors frown on us, and regard us&#xD;
With looks that cannot be mistaken. I am in.&#xD;
lined to think that Dunbar and the young'man&#xD;
who is always with him, are at the bottom of&#xD;
this, if the truth Were known," said Wintermoot.&#xD;
" That is a matter long since settled in my&#xD;
mind ; and I have taken measures to rid myself&#xD;
of their troublesome watchfulness," returned the&#xD;
other.-&#xD;
"Plans that have reference to them must be&#xD;
surely laid and well executed, for more expe-&#xD;
rienced and cunning fellows never trod the for'&#xD;
eat," Wintermoot answered.&#xD;
"'Well do I know that they are ever on the&#xD;
Alert, for already have they baffled my purpose&#xD;
more than once. But look! who comes here "&#xD;
"A friend," replied the person whose aps&#xD;
proach- had excitedthe last remark.&#xD;
"PFrom whom ?" inquired Linaway.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I know this man, and can form some guess&#xD;
of his errand," said the other.&#xD;
"Is your name Wintermoot V" asked the&#xD;
man.&#xD;
" It is ; we are alone-speak freely. Are you&#xD;
the bearer of any especial message V"&#xD;
" I come from the camp of Colonel John&#xD;
-Butler."&#xD;
" There are no inquisitive ears near us&#xD;
added Wintermoot, perceiving that the messen-&#xD;
ger hesitated.&#xD;
" Not long since the colonel sent an Indian td&#xD;
confer with you on important subjects."&#xD;
" Ete;eame-faithful to his trust."&#xD;
"But has not returned," said the man.&#xD;
Both Wintermoot and Lanaway manifested&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"That is most strange. We met him at the&#xD;
hour appointed, received the instructions of the&#xD;
colonel, and duly arranged the matter to mutual&#xD;
satisfaction. We acceded to the propositions of&#xD;
which the,Mohawk *as the bearer," rejoined the&#xD;
former.&#xD;
"A few days ago, the body of the Indian mes-&#xD;
senger was found in the river,-some four or five&#xD;
miles above Lac awannoek Gap."&#xD;
Lanaway and .his friend looked at each other&#xD;
uneasily, an  a slight paleness overspregd their&#xD;
features.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Were there any papers found on the body " ed&#xD;
Wintermoot demanded.                       ly&#xD;
"Nothing of the kind."&#xD;
" Then I fear we are betrayed! How was it a"&#xD;
"A rifle bal passed through his breast, most yo&#xD;
evidently."                           m&#xD;
"It is the work of the scout 1" muttered&#xD;
Lanaway.                                   t&#xD;
" This is bad. I wonder exceedingly that we sthv  o  eoeti  oetfle itfi oan&#xD;
havno before thiswont efalle, victim to ai&#xD;
the. fury of our rebellious neighbors. If the he&#xD;
scout had a hand in this business, why has he&#xD;
kept the matter so much tohimself ? why has, b&#xD;
he not publicly denounced us i"&#xD;
"He is too cunning for that. Depend on it&#xD;
he's been studying up something deeper than&#xD;
that. He is, you are aware, not a man to do i&#xD;
things by halves. If he really killed the Indian, si&#xD;
we shall hear from him in some way that we&#xD;
do not expect," said Lanaway.&#xD;
" Go back to the colonel and tell him that the&#xD;
time fixed upon was the second of Jay, at mid- a&#xD;
night. It will be enough to tell him this ; as-&#xD;
sure him that I shallbe ready," said Wintermoot.&#xD;
"This is all you would say "&#xD;
"All, except to warn you to watchfulness on&#xD;
your return. Dunbar is busy now, and if heI&#xD;
takes your trail, you'll never -see the camp of&#xD;
Butler again."   -&#xD;
"Is he so dangerous as this special warning t&#xD;
would seem to indicate "&#xD;
-" He and a young man called Montour, are&#xD;
moving about from place to place with the speed&#xD;
of a moose, observing the movements of the&#xD;
different partiesengaged in this strife, anddoing&#xD;
much to hinder the success of the royal arms."&#xD;
" Iam somewhat used to the woods and will do&#xD;
my best to keep out of their way. And now, if&#xD;
there's no more to be said, I'llhurry back to&#xD;
camp." --The messenger departed, and Lana-&#xD;
way a dW  intermoot turned toward the fort.&#xD;
While this scene was passing In the forest,&#xD;
another was enacting at Mr. EHunlon's. The&#xD;
family had assembled in the large square room&#xD;
in whirkthe plentiful board was always spread,&#xD;
and were about to sit down to the principal&#xD;
meal of thelday, whensthe scout appeared at the&#xD;
door, which Mr. Hudson quickly threw open,&#xD;
and cordially greeting Dunbar; invited shim to&#xD;
enter.&#xD;
Ellen Devron beheld his approach with much&#xD;
Interest, andwondered Iftfontbtr was not near;&#xD;
for-sincebeth -her fherntberselgrreindebt"&#xD;
&#xD;
to him for efficient services, she felt a friend-&#xD;
regard for the gallant young stranger.&#xD;
" We are very glad to see you again," said&#xD;
r. Devron. " The last time we met was un-&#xD;
r different circumstances, and when I saw&#xD;
ur honest face emerge from the rock, it was to&#xD;
Le a most welcome sight."&#xD;
" Well, I suppose it might naturally be, all&#xD;
ings considered; for you was in a kind of&#xD;
,might place as one may say. I hope the gals&#xD;
ad the women folks generally are in usual&#xD;
health i"&#xD;
"They may speak for themselves, Mr. Dun.&#xD;
ar ; you will see them all here, I believe, if you&#xD;
eok about you."&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Montour?" asked Devron.&#xD;
We surely must not be so ungrateful as not to&#xD;
uquire after the welfare of one to whom we feel&#xD;
o much indebted." ,.-t&#xD;
A change passed over the countenance of the&#xD;
cout, and for an instant he was silent.&#xD;
" I hope no evil has befallen the young man ?"&#xD;
dded Devron.&#xD;
"He's taken" replied Dunbar, mournfully.&#xD;
" By whom " was the quick inquiry.&#xD;
"The Mohawks."&#xD;
'The scout looked up and met the eyes of&#xD;
Ellen fixed earnestly upon him, and noticed that&#xD;
her cheeks were very pale.&#xD;
"What were the circumstances of his cap.&#xD;
ture ?" returned Devron. .&#xD;
"Asmall war-party of the Mohawks captured&#xD;
a half breed woman-near the village of the Dela-&#xD;
wtes, and we took the trail in order to liberate&#xD;
her, if possible; because there's somethin' dread-&#xD;
helin the idea of a human cretur's being' given&#xD;
up to the tender mercies of the cruel savages,&#xD;
especially female. We followed 'em two days&#xD;
afore we could do anything. On the second&#xD;
night of the pursuit, they stopped to eat and&#xD;
sleep. After building a fire, and cookin' and&#xD;
seatin',they set one to watch, and laid down in&#xD;
their-blankets, having secured the captive in a&#xD;
way toleave her little chance of-escape. About&#xD;
midnight the one on guard began to dose, and&#xD;
finally fell asleep so soundly that he wont wake&#xD;
till he last trumpet is sounded. We stole up&#xD;

we haksehitherto spoken of Elvira Hudson'in a&#xD;
casual way only. We will at this stage of our&#xD;
storyetate that she was about the same age as&#xD;
Ellen Devron, and in many respects like her in&#xD;
person and disposition. A good share ofbeauty&#xD;
-ad been accorded her by nature-that some-&#xD;
what erratic dispenser of gifts. - Her fresh and&#xD;
gwingecheeks; cherry lips, and laughing dark&#xD;
eyes, had produced a very decided impression&#xD;
eisn Edward Gaston ; and though he was an&#xD;
unpresming, person and said btit little, he was&#xD;
often found in the society of Miss Hudson,'Iook-&#xD;
ig those gentler'sentiments which he could not&#xD;
summon courage to express in vocal sounds.&#xD;
Many a feeling of jealousy had the unpretending&#xD;
attentions of Gaston awakened in the bosoms of&#xD;
certain young men of his own age.&#xD;
Among those who regarded his advances with&#xD;
settled dislike, no one was so hostile to his pur-&#xD;
pose as .Martin Secord. This individual had&#xD;
been a resident of Wyoming but i yeafor two,&#xD;
and his adhesion to the royal cause was at that&#xD;
time strongly suspected. He watched the grow-&#xD;
ing intimacy between the parties mentioned, with&#xD;
feelings of diseatisfactioll which he could not&#xD;
well conceal. He had triedin various waysbto&#xD;
make himself agreeable to Miss Hudson, _but&#xD;
had been steadily repulsed at all points. It is a&#xD;
fact generally understood that there is a certain&#xD;
class of young men who will not accept the brief&#xD;
monosyllsble. "no," for an answer, when they&#xD;
venture upon the bold experiment of asking gen&#xD;
tie damsels hard questions ; but perseveringl&#xD;
-persist i their purpose, rto the great annoyan&#xD;
of the faik ones, who prefer to have their ows&#xD;
choice in matters of this delicate nature-&#xD;
Martin Secord belonged to the class retrred&#xD;
to, and npver met Miss Hudson without directly&#xD;
or indirectly pressing his suit. The constn&#xD;
refusals which he received served to incree the&#xD;
acerbity, of a disposition naturally sour,&#xD;
when he perceived another ready to b af di&#xD;
coveted prize, hs inherent malignancy and dis&#xD;
content, received fresh stimulus. With evil ey&#xD;
Ike noted the visits of Edward Gaston, and con&#xD;
coeted dark schemes of vengeance. Being tral&#xD;
royalist at heart, he imagined that he saw ninth&#xD;
means of working out his designs. Being int&#xD;
mate with Lanaway, Wintermoot and-others'o&#xD;
a similar mode f sinking, .he was a party;t&#xD;
their nefarious plans. With;the first he was:&#xD;
particularly good ternnsf  it wasin his pw'&#xD;
to tell an oxpe gaee 4A unlike his own-.-a cif&#xD;
&#xD;
cumnstance -calcelated to produce sympathetic&#xD;
relations between them., Miss Ellen Devron&#xD;
had repelled emphatically the addresses of Lana.&#xD;
way; while Miss Elvira Hudson had as unequivo-&#xD;
cally manifested a disinclination to change her&#xD;
name to Secord,; and these two facts taken to,&#xD;
gether were enough to produce a strong fellow.&#xD;
feeling aside from any political considerations.&#xD;
In Edward Gaston, Martin fancied he sawan&#xD;
enemy to-his happiness, as well as an enemy to&#xD;
the king ; but'Lanaway was rejected without&#xD;
'knowing for whom-Ellep had a partiality, or if she&#xD;
had a preference for any one in particular. If he&#xD;
had suspicions respecting her inclinations, by&#xD;
some inexplicable weans he got the idea into his&#xD;
mind that I.they--Ellen'a inclinations-tended&#xD;
toward Roland' Montour.  He was sure .that&#xD;
there had been but little intercourse- between&#xD;
them, but he thought there had been sufficient to&#xD;
beget a mutual liking. How this notion could&#xD;
justly have been formed, is not easy to deter-&#xD;
mine; but disappointed lovers are apt to get all&#xD;

We have asserted that Martin Secord was sus-  " Somethin' whispers in my ear and assures&#xD;

in the room who were steadily observing Secord, and gazed at the speaker ; and while he did so&#xD;
but whose habits of self-control were such that a painful expression passed over his sinister face ;&#xD;
they were able to restrain all outward appearance probably a feeling of momentary dread and re-&#xD;
of curiosity. Miss Hudson, although pretend- gret such as theo false-hearted feel in moments&#xD;

" Think so,if you will, you poor, misguided&#xD;
cretur I Think so, till you hear the crack of&#xD;
Morgan's rifles, and the loud roar of Proctor's&#xD;
artillery."&#xD;
"Morgan's rifles I" exclaimed Martin, with a&#xD;
quivering lip.&#xD;
"Agin afore I depart, let me say woe to him&#xD;
as betrays his neighbor, and doesnot so much as&#xD;
say 'the Phillistians be' upon thee.'  These&#xD;
words as I throw out now wont be likely to be&#xD;

and solemn manner.&#xD;

"Amen, say I to that, and it don't come from&#xD;

them as prove faithful to their country and the&#xD;

Martin Secord looked toward the spot where&#xD;
Elvira was seated, and encountered her bright&#xD;
eyes speaking volumes of scorn, contempt and&#xD;
pity. To increase his ill-humor and mortifica-&#xD;
tion, the.door was opened and Edward Gaston&#xD;
stood in their midst. Casting one dark and&#xD;
threatening glance toward the fair damsel, and&#xD;
another upon the scout and the last comer, Mar-&#xD;
tin grasped his rifle nervously and strode from&#xD;
the cabin.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
MARTIN'S SCHEME.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE shadows, of night had rested some three The soft, and flickering, reflections of the burd-&#xD;
hours on the valley of Wyoming, ana the pale ing wick shone on Miss Hudson's face in a man-&#xD;
mistress of that dimmer part of the day had just ner to display its loveliness to the best advan-&#xD;
reached that portion of the skies where she could tage, and while Secord felt his passion for her&#xD;
&#xD;
vaguely paint the forms of the trees and other&#xD;
scenery upon the banks, in the waters of the&#xD;
Susquehanna.&#xD;
Martin Secord was wandering about like an&#xD;
unquiet spirit of evil, forbidden' to rest by the&#xD;
continual chiding of a bad conscience. Many&#xD;
times during the evening, he had approached the&#xD;
cabin of Mr. Hudson, and as often changed his&#xD;
mind and walked away in another direction; but&#xD;
now bracing up his courage to the point desir-&#xD;
able, he advanced until he stood by the little.&#xD;
window. Although it is esteemed bymany per-&#xD;
sons a breach of etiquette to look in at a neigh-&#xD;
bor's window, Martin had no such scruples. He&#xD;
saw a candle burning upon the plain deal table,&#xD;
and its fitful beams revealed a sight that made&#xD;
him bite his lips with jealousy and rage.&#xD;
The dim rays fell upon the forms of Elvira&#xD;
Hudson and Edward Gaston, sitting not far&#xD;
apart, conversing-in low and confidential tones.&#xD;
This was a scene ill calculated to soothe the&#xD;
already irritated feelings of a rival lover. He&#xD;
beheld the maiden whom he imagined most dear'&#xD;
of all in the world, receiving the attentions of&#xD;
one whom he regarded as a rebel and an enemy.&#xD;
&#xD;
increasing, his hatred for the young man at her&#xD;
side grew in the same proportion.&#xD;
He gazed a mouxent longer upon the sweet&#xD;
face of the maiden, and then with a muttered&#xD;
curse fled from the window, as though pursued&#xD;
by some powerful and dreaded foe, Walking&#xD;
now fast and then slow, and now pausing to&#xD;
collect his thoughts, Secord at length reached a&#xD;
sheltered spot near the river.&#xD;
With folded arms, sullen brow, and compress-&#xD;
ed lp, he stood awhile and gazed at the shad-&#xD;
ows which the gentle moon was flinging into the&#xD;
limpid water. Those insensible and fantastic&#xD;
figures 'seemed to awaken reflection.&#xD;
"Shadows I" he exclaimed, " shadows falling&#xD;
upon the fickle water, even like the image of&#xD;
Elvira falling upon my heart."&#xD;
Martin signed,-and then looking up at the&#xD;
moon, added :&#xD;
"Hury on--hurry on, cold, insensate orb I&#xD;
Hasten on ,thy ethereal way, that the hour of&#xD;
vengeance may come speedily. Thou alone, 0&#xD;
unsympathizing planet, shalt be witness of this&#xD;
deed. Look on then, if thou wilt, and see me&#xD;
strike a viper from my path, and send a rebel on&#xD;

&#xD;
40                             THE ROYA&#xD;
his last long march, without beat of drum or&#xD;
sound of trumpet."&#xD;
Martin ceased and carefully examined the&#xD;
priming of his rifle, adjusted the flint,,and took&#xD;
every precaution to put it in the best of order.&#xD;
He then crouched 'in the abundant shrubbery,&#xD;
and thrusting his weapon through the same, so&#xD;
as to command the path that came very near it,&#xD;
in one of its erratic bends, lay quite motionless.'&#xD;
0, night, thou great witness of crime ! how&#xD;
many a tale of wickedness couldst thou tell,&#xD;
wert thou sentient and endowed with human&#xD;
speech !  But thy Master, dark  night, hath&#xD;
wisdom, and a voice, and an eye more om-&#xD;
niscient and  omnipresent than  thine, and&#xD;
verily he reproves the world of sin, of righteous-&#xD;
ness and of judgment, and bringeth all hidden&#xD;
things to light.&#xD;
We cannot trace the direful thoughts that&#xD;
rushed through the brain of Martin as he laid&#xD;
there upon the ground ; but they must have been&#xD;
of a kind akin to the pains of the 'consuming&#xD;
fire's of Hades. His eyes grew weary of gazing&#xD;
at vacancy, and picturing forms and faces when&#xD;
there were none near him. Sometimes a bush&#xD;
or a twice caused his heart to beat quicker, -and&#xD;
took, in his morbid sight, a figure familiar, and&#xD;
flitted about before his tired vision like a mock-&#xD;
ing phantom.   He was obliged to press -his&#xD;
aching' eye-balls 'and close the lids upon them,&#xD;
in order to exorcise the deceptive forms.&#xD;
Hitt what was that which sent the blood&#xD;
rushing to its fount, and then forced it back to&#xD;
his faey with indescribable celerity'? It sounded&#xD;
like-a footfall, and a footfall it was. Martin&#xD;
peered from his ambush to catch the first glimpse&#xD;
of the person who might appear ; but his sight&#xD;
-     was so clouded that he, saw nothing distinctly at&#xD;
first. But soon a real figure, endowed with voli-&#xD;
tion and locomotion, was visible, and he knew&#xD;
that his strained eyes were deceived no longer.&#xD;
The man approached - slowly, and Martin&#xD;
could not well- mistake the height, etep and&#xD;
bearing of Edward Gaston.    He placed his&#xD;
cheek to the breech of his rifle, and- looking&#xD;
along the barrel, covered the breast of the young&#xD;
man-the honest heart full of the love of Elvira&#xD;
Hudson. Martin's finger touched "the trigger,&#xD;
and tried to keep his pent-up breath fromm burst-&#xD;
ing forth with a nervous vehemence to destroy&#xD;
the deadliness of his aini. He was sure that his&#xD;
rival would not live ailother instant, when with&#xD;
a prolonged and fearful shudder that seemed to&#xD;
teach the very marrow of his bones, he felt a&#xD;
&#xD;
hand laid quietly upon his shoulder. Martin's&#xD;
finger fell nerveless from the trigger, and he&#xD;
turned behind him a look so startled, and re-&#xD;
vealed a visage so pale, that his crime was al&#xD;
ready confessed. Dubar, the scout of the Sus&#xD;
quehanna, stood beside him. The young man&#xD;
was about to rise, but the hunter placed his foot&#xD;
on his prostrate form, and motioned him to be&#xD;
quiet until Gaston had passed.&#xD;
There followed a few ;moments of silence,&#xD;
during which time the emotions of Martin were&#xD;
not of a nature to be envied. When Elvira's&#xD;
lover had turned the bend and disappeared, the&#xD;
scout suffered Secord to recover his feet, which&#xD;
he did with fear and trembling.&#xD;
" I wish I was a painter,-that I might make a&#xD;
picter of a midnight assassin !" said Dunbar,&#xD;
looking sternly at Martin. "I suspected that&#xD;
your principles wasn't no better nor this. Mur-&#xD;
der must come easy to one who tampers with&#xD;
the enemies of liberty, and cells his neighbors&#xD;
to John Butler, to be cut to pieces by his ran-&#xD;
gers ?" added the scout.&#xD;
" I suppose it don't make much difference&#xD;
what you think. Everybody don't see the same&#xD;
thing in the same way,"-replied Martin, sullenly.&#xD;
"I can't spend much time in talkin' with one&#xD;
like you, because it's a waste o' words ; but that&#xD;
I havecaught you in the act of committing a&#xD;
greatacrime, you can't deny. Now some folks&#xD;
would have finished you at once, but that isn't&#xD;
my way of doing business" said the scout.&#xD;
" Of course I wasn't intending to fire," added&#xD;
Martin.&#xD;
"I am too old a man to be deceived by so&#xD;
foolish a falsehood, and so I'll-spare you the&#xD;
trouble of repeating it. If-you was better pre-&#xD;
pared to die, Iwould make an end of you on&#xD;
the spot ; but I can't bring my mind to send you&#xD;
out of time in such an onprepared state. You&#xD;
must be very careful in future in regard to your&#xD;
conduct; because I shall have an eye on you, as&#xD;
'twere."&#xD;
Secord could make no reasonable reply,: and&#xD;
therefore, with downcast eyes, muttered some-&#xD;
thing about people's minding their own business.&#xD;
"-If we should ever chance to meet agin in&#xD;
sich a manner as we have to-night, we sha'n't&#xD;
part in the same 'way, but you'll go where you&#xD;
wont come back to do mischief, and serve the&#xD;
wicked one, as I may say."&#xD;
" I hope you wont say much in relation- to&#xD;
this. You see the girl's beauty has turned my&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROYAL&#xD;
&#xD;
head, and I hardly kpow what I'm doing," said&#xD;
Martin, in a more humble tone.&#xD;
"That's a poor excuse, Martin Secord, though&#xD;
perhaps better nor none." '&#xD;
"You never loved a fair creature like Elvira&#xD;
Hudson," returned the other.&#xD;
"I have loved in my day-and as- fair a cre-&#xD;
tur as ever walked up and down the airth, but&#xD;
it didn't make me seek to take the-life of a feller-&#xD;
bein',"said the scout, sadly.&#xD;
"How long ago might that be ?"&#xD;
"I don't care to tell how long or how short;&#xD;
...:4         that's my secret; ,but I'm  not the worse for&#xD;
h-in' loved. Ginerwine love, it seems to me,&#xD;
doesn't make the heart dark with-wicked pas-&#xD;
sions, but purifies it, as 'twere, from  airthly&#xD;
dross. I'm not very larned in books, and don't&#xD;
know much about the opinion, of them as may&#xD;
have written on the subject, but I've a strange&#xD;
notion, though it perhaps arises from my igno-&#xD;
rance, that true love, accordin' to the course of&#xD;
natur, elevates one's mind, as I may say, and&#xD;
fortifies it agin the temptations of the enemy."&#xD;
Martin looked steadily at Dunbar as if he did&#xD;
not quite take his meaning. Bad is he unques-&#xD;
tionably was, he could-not help feeling the force&#xD;
of the scout's reasoning, nor resist the convic-&#xD;
tion that he was influenced by motions higher&#xD;
and manlier than his own. There was, to the&#xD;
dark soul of Secord, something-inexplicably curi-&#xD;
ous in the honest nature of Dunbar, and the&#xD;
sentiments which he advanced with so much&#xD;
simplicity.&#xD;
'f You look at me as though there was sqme-&#xD;
thin' oncommon droll in the idea that I should&#xD;
have loved a fair maiden ; but love' is' a thing&#xD;
which finds its way into all places, and can't be&#xD;
kept out by lock, key, bolt or bar. And why&#xD;
should you stare as though it was out of the&#xD;
common order of events for a man like me to&#xD;
confess the power of gentle woman I Secord,&#xD;
you know but little of the human heart, if you&#xD;
imagine a roggh exterior cuts one off from the&#xD;
rest of mankind, and makes him impregnable to&#xD;
beauty, as 'twerp."&#xD;
"Did you have a rival ?" inquired Martin.&#xD;
The scout passed his hand over his eyes and&#xD;
something like a sigh escaped him.&#xD;
"I dare say I had a rival, because she was&#xD;
wondrous fair, and it couldn't well be otherwise;&#xD;
but I don't know sartin. Sonmetimes I was fool&#xD;
enough to think she didn't dislike me at all, and&#xD;
was, in fact, partial to me, as I may say."&#xD;
Again Dubar paused.'&#xD;
&#xD;
LL GREENS.                              41&#xD;
"How long before you forgot her ?" Martin&#xD;
aiked, with soine interest.&#xD;
"Forgot her ! that time hasn't come yet !"&#xD;
replied Dunbar, in a low voice, casting his eyes&#xD;
upwardd to the silvery sky, with. a patient and&#xD;
resigned expression.&#xD;
"Your nature is different from mine," said&#xD;
Martin.&#xD;
"I"- should hope so-I wouldn't have a natur&#xD;
like yours on no consideration whatsomever.&#xD;
With your dispersition I shouldn't expect to die&#xD;
a peaceful death, or experience a very happy&#xD;
hereafter."&#xD;
During the time this conversation had been&#xD;
going on, Martin's right hand had been in the&#xD;
pocket of his hunting frock, and his fingers had&#xD;
been working nervously over something which it&#xD;
contained. At one moment his feelings soften-&#xD;
ed, and at the next some word of the scout&#xD;
Would change them back to their wonted hard-&#xD;
ness and impenetrability. There was a conflict&#xD;
in his breast between good and ill, and he could&#xD;
neither summon resolution to carry out his half-&#xD;
formed determination, nor command sufficient&#xD;
virtuous resolve to abandon 'it; therefore he&#xD;
strove to prolong the conversation with Dunbar&#xD;
until he should have worked his courage to the&#xD;
proper condition. The truth was, that he had&#xD;
in his pocket a pistol, and it was that weapon&#xD;
that his uneasy fingers toyed with so assiduously&#xD;
and clutched with the, nervousness of an imper-&#xD;
fectly planned deed of wickedness, which was&#xD;
too far developed to forego, and not matured&#xD;
enough to execute without some hesitation.&#xD;
So while the scout stood beside him, merci-&#xD;
fully scorning to take advantage of the discovery&#xD;
he had made, and Which in other hands would&#xD;
have resulted most fatally, he was forming a'&#xD;
deadly purpose,. forgetful of the forbearance of&#xD;
the man in whose power he now found himself.&#xD;
When Dunbar turned his thoughtful face to-&#xD;
ward the placid heavens, as if to hold commu-&#xD;
nion sweet with the distant planets, and imbibe&#xD;
a portion of their gentle serenity, Martin cocked&#xD;
the pistol in his pocket.&#xD;
Instantly he felt a powerfulgrasp upon his arm,&#xD;
and saw the eyes of the scout fixed sternly upon&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Habit, young man, is second natur, and my&#xD;
ears have long been trained to detect the slight-&#xD;
est sound. The experience of many years don't&#xD;
go for nothin'. A poor woodsman should I be,&#xD;
if I couldn't hear the click of a rifle or a pistol,&#xD;
or the crackling of the smallest twig,", he .said,&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ONnIDAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT has been casually stated that the Iroquois&#xD;
confederacy (constituting the Six Nations), em-&#xD;
braced the Onondagas, Senecas, Mohawks, Cayu-&#xD;
gas, Tuscaroras and  Oneidas. These allied&#xD;
tribes inhabited northern Pennsylvania and west-&#xD;
ern New York, committing cruel ravages upon&#xD;
the north-western frontier.  Small war-parties&#xD;
under their respective chieftains continually hung&#xD;
about the border settlements, rushing. from their&#xD;
covert in the still night hour, slaying helpless&#xD;
families, firing dwellings, and bearing off in&#xD;
savage triumph- reeking scalps, torn from the&#xD;
heads of old and young-from loving mothers&#xD;
and fair maidens, lisping children, and- hopeful&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
It wasone of these predatory bands into whose&#xD;
power Roland Montour had fallen.- We have&#xD;
given only Dunbar's brief version of that event,&#xD;
and therefore deem it proper to make a more&#xD;
detailed statement in regard to the same. It has&#xD;
been sufficiently set forth that the half-breed&#xD;
woman, passing among the Delawares by the&#xD;
name of Pale Cloud, had been duly rescued by-&#xD;
the combined cunning and bravery-of our hero&#xD;
and the scout. The habiteof the Indians to be-&#xD;
stow nicknames is universally known to those&#xD;
having any definite knowledge of native cus-1&#xD;
toms. . Such appellations. are usually derived&#xD;
from some' peculiarity of the person to whom&#xD;
&#xD;
they are given, or of the place which they occupy.&#xD;
It will be enough for the-right understanding of&#xD;
our story, to say that the name which the half-&#xD;
breed had originally received from her ]French&#xD;
sire, Was Katherine ; but. after his decease her&#xD;
name was little used by the Delawares, it being&#xD;
considered by them a very hard, unnatuial, and&#xD;
strange one; so that the sobriquet-of Pale Cloud&#xD;
ultimately forced the civilized cognomen from&#xD;
the field. If, therefore, we should occasionally&#xD;
employ the name derived from the white side of&#xD;
her pedigree, the reader will be at no loss to&#xD;
comprehend us.&#xD;
It will not be profitable to dwell upon the de-&#xD;
tails of the pursuit and rescue of the half-breed.&#xD;
We would not direct the attention too much to&#xD;
scenes of blood-no more than what the fear-&#xD;
ful pictures of that period reveal-nor even so&#xD;
much ; for the minds of thesympathizing turn&#xD;
in horror from the simple history of that dread-&#xD;
ful dramna, the star actors of which were parti-&#xD;
zan murderers and native warriors, tricked out&#xD;
in all the deadly; habiliments of such a stage.&#xD;
The work had been right well accomplished, and&#xD;
the sole survivor of his party returned to his&#xD;
people witha dangerous wound and a story that&#xD;
produced mourning among the braves.&#xD;
At the close of the second day's -travel toward&#xD;
the valley, it became imperatively necesa'ry that&#xD;
&#xD;
go hence into that unknown region where they&#xD;
say repentance does no good."&#xD;
With downcast eyes and unsteady step, Mar-&#xD;
tin turned from Dunbar, took the path which&#xD;
Gaston had so - recently trodden, and- in a mo-&#xD;
ment was out of sight.&#xD;
The scout moved a few steps down the river&#xD;
and paused. Perhaps he was thinking of the&#xD;
past. *Possibly his thoughts dwelt on the maiden&#xD;
he had been speaking of, and the quiet loveli-&#xD;
ness of the night in some way reminded him of&#xD;
that being who had touched the fountain of his&#xD;
affection with the wand of her beauty, causing&#xD;
it to send forth a stream that would flow on un-&#xD;
checked and undiminished until life itself waned&#xD;
like the feeble flame of a failing lamp.&#xD;

the parties.should partake of refreshment, hav-&#xD;
ing exhausted their little stock of food the night&#xD;
previous. 'Their steps had been hurried, their&#xD;
precautions to elude pursuit many, and no time&#xD;
had been allowed for sleep.           *&#xD;
Pale Cloud had borne up under the hardships&#xD;
of the way, with inimitable courage and pa-&#xD;
tience ; but Montour could not endure to see&#xD;
her growing faint and weak for want of nourish-&#xD;
ment ; therefore bidding the scout proceed to-&#xD;
wa, the cavern, which could not then be at a&#xD;
great distance, he directed his footsteps to a well-&#xD;
known .ot where deer were wont to abound.&#xD;
Game, in those days, -was abundant in the&#xD;
Pokbno mountain ranges, and Montour soon&#xD;
discovei-ed a fat doe'browsing the tender buds&#xD;
of a birch. 'It happened, however, unfortunately,&#xD;
ths he had approached the animal on the wind-&#xD;
ward side, and the breeze carried to itsensitive&#xD;
nostrils sure knowledge of his proximity Throw-&#xD;
ing up its white bushy tail, it started off upon&#xD;
the run, and though the distance was consider-&#xD;
able and every moment increasing, and the&#xD;
chances of success rendered still less by its mo-&#xD;
tion, Montour fired, butevidently without effect.&#xD;
While loading his rifle, a warrior of the Onei-&#xD;
da tribe stepped from behind a tree not two&#xD;
yards distant, with his gun cocked and present-&#xD;
ed at our ,'hero's breast. Roland would have&#xD;
resisted, even as -much as-the native had advan-&#xD;
tage, had not a furtive-glance around him re-&#xD;
vealed other dusky forms.&#xD;
You no stand still, I fire I" said the Oneida,&#xD;
for there were but few of the Indians who had.&#xD;
not some knowledge of the English tongue.-&#xD;
"You light, I shoot"&#xD;
Resistance seemed utterly useless, and with a&#xD;
feeling of dread Montour surrendered himself to&#xD;
captivity ; for so well he knew the -usages -of&#xD;
savage warfare that he was- fully aware of the&#xD;
dangers before him as a prisoner to the Oneidas.&#xD;
With a sigh of regret, he saw the chief of the&#xD;
party examining his excellent rifle with the ob-&#xD;
vious intention of de$6ting it to his own use.&#xD;
Nor were his'reflections made of a more happy&#xD;
kind, when they proceeded to bind his hands&#xD;
with atrips'of- green, undressed deerskin, so&#xD;
tightly that his wrist -speedily commenced swell-&#xD;
ing, giving.him much pain.&#xD;
"Dog of a Pale Face ! you shall no longer&#xD;
walk these woods tp be aspy upon the Iroquois I"&#xD;
exclaimed the Oneida chief.-&#xD;
S I -am a Delaware,"said Montour.&#xD;
".The Delawards nre women !" retorted the&#xD;
&#xD;
Oneida, who was called by the unpronounceable&#xD;
name of Gi-en-gwa-tah, which signifies He-who-&#xD;
goes-inthe-smoke.&#xD;
"They are women no longer ; , they have&#xD;
washed away the reproach in the blood of the&#xD;
Shawanese and the Mengwe," said Montour. -&#xD;
"Itis a reproach they can never wash away,&#xD;
though they should open a stream of blood as&#xD;
large as the Busquehanna," returned the chief,&#xD;
contemptuously..                    .&#xD;
" The Delawares are bold and magnanimous,&#xD;
and the Mengwe (the Sii Nations are sometimes&#xD;
called) are .artful and false. They do not deal&#xD;
openly like men, but deceive with a smooth&#xD;
tongue like a gossiping squaw;'and the Lenni&#xD;
,Lenapes  are ashamed of them," returned&#xD;
Roland.&#xD;
"You talk bravely for one whose skin is al-&#xD;
most white," rejoined the chief, ironically.&#xD;
"I do not care for color-I have -regard for&#xD;
deeds. Go and ask the Mohawk if we acted&#xD;
like women when we followed their trail, hur-&#xD;
prised them at night, and took away their cap--&#xD;
tive," resumed Roland.&#xD;
" They were not Oneidas," said the chief.&#xD;
"No, but braver men."&#xD;
The warrior turned upon Montour an angry-&#xD;
glance, and motioned him to 'walk faster.&#xD;
Some persons may possibly-question Roland's&#xD;
policy in thus bearding his enemies while in their&#xD;
power, and query whether language more con-&#xD;
ciliatory would not have tended to soften the&#xD;
sternness of captivity;- but it is a fact well-known&#xD;
that the savages were wont to respect a bold,&#xD;
stout-hearted and even audacious captive, more&#xD;
than -a weak, cowardly and repining one ; and&#xD;
Montour doubtless understood well the character&#xD;
of those with whom he was dealing, and governed&#xD;
himself accordingly. The exhibition of pusilla-&#xD;
nimity instantly reduces the consideration of a&#xD;
savage for his prisoners and is the signal to&#xD;
treat himtwith every species =of insult.&#xD;
The Oneidas directed their course -toward the&#xD;
upper'tributaries of the Susquehanna, where the&#xD;
forces of Butler and-the .allied nations were en-&#xD;
camped. Like most'of the scouting parties and&#xD;
predatory hands thrown-out by the main body,&#xD;
they were few in number, consisting of but seven&#xD;
-braves,4hree-of whon'had nuar beenon the&#xD;

&#xD;
trodden  the war-path. had made a 'vow-'not&#xD;
to wash the paint from their faces until they had&#xD;
taken a scalp or a prisoner ; and now we-e highly&#xD;
elated at their success, as fortune had favored&#xD;
their designs in a particular manner.&#xD;
As they defiled rapidly through the forest,&#xD;
'with Montour in their midst, their hearts were&#xD;
elated with savage joy, and they longed for the&#xD;
moment when the torture and the death-dance&#xD;
should-finish their triumph and complete their&#xD;
vengeance.&#xD;
After proceeding a couple of hours, the Oneida&#xD;
leader  stopped  and examined the heavens&#xD;
through a vista in the trees.&#xD;
"My brother of the Iroquois wishes to lay his&#xD;
course direct to the.camp," said Montour, with&#xD;
' a smile. "And now," he added, "I will tell him&#xD;
which way to go, for I perceive that his eyes are&#xD;
not sharp, and he reads but poorly the language&#xD;
of the north star. My face," continued Roland,&#xD;
changing his-position, " is now toward the great&#xD;
lodge of the Oneidas."&#xD;
The' Oneida hesitated to reply, knowing that&#xD;
his prisoner was right, and manifested some un-&#xD;
easiness lest he should fall in the estimation of&#xD;
his warriors.&#xD;
"I know," he said at length "the voice of the&#xD;
north star, for I have listened to its talk many&#xD;
years, and I will not ask a boy to tell me what&#xD;
it says about the trail of the Oneidas."&#xD;
" I have told you the way, cousin-do not&#xD;
keep me waiting, for I am impatient to see the&#xD;
sickly faces of the people whom you call war-&#xD;
riors, but who fight like old women hoeing corn,"&#xD;
added Montour.&#xD;
The leader frowned, the three neophyte war-&#xD;
riors clutched their hatchets angrily, and looked&#xD;
wistfully to their chief, for a signal to slay the&#xD;
insulter of their nation ; but the Oneida folded&#xD;
his arms and smiled grimly.&#xD;
'We will see how he will bear himself when&#xD;
the Oneidas light the fire of torture, and apply&#xD;
the yellow pine splinters to his white flesh !" he&#xD;
exclaimed, recovering his wonted dignity of&#xD;
demeanor. -&#xD;
Just before daylight they halted to rest. The&#xD;
captive and the warriors laid down upon the&#xD;
ground, but the leader slept with his back to a&#xD;
* tree to prevent surprise. Once when Montour&#xD;
lifted his head to look about him to see if there&#xD;
was any chanceof escape, he fancied he saw a&#xD;
face peering cautiously through a thicket of&#xD;
furzi; but the object passed so quickly from his&#xD;
sight that he could not well determine whether&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
he had been deceived by some deceptive shadow&#xD;
or intervening bush, or whether he had indeedd&#xD;
caught a momentary glimpse of a'human visage.&#xD;
He turned many a furtive: yet - anxious glance&#xD;
toward the spot but saw' nothing to confirm his&#xD;
first - impression.: The darkness soon after fell&#xD;
thicker, and the clump of bushes was hidden&#xD;
from his view. He sank into a troubled sleep,&#xD;
and dreamed of Dunbar .and his long 'rifle, and&#xD;
saw him on the trail resolved to 'effect his rescue,&#xD;
or perish in the desperate endeavor. -What a&#xD;
goodly sight it was (and how it cheered hin&#xD;
even when he awoke) to see'he scout Ike the&#xD;
track of the Oneidas, like a hound keen of scent&#xD;
and sure of foot, never flagging; never despair-&#xD;
ing, ever sanguine, 'ever true to his better im-&#xD;
pulses, ever mindful of his friendship.&#xD;
He opened his eyes and saw the watchful&#xD;
chief leaning against the tree, and heard the heavy&#xD;
respirations of the braves. The morning had&#xD;
dawned. The sleepers were aroused, some dried&#xD;
venison was eaten in haste, and the march&#xD;
resumed.&#xD;
During the day the circumstance of his having&#xD;
seen a face, or more properly of his having fan-&#xD;
cied that he had seen one, was often thought of,&#xD;
and he' cast searching glances behind him  and&#xD;
into the surrounding woods when he could 'do so&#xD;
without exciting the attention of his captors.&#xD;
On one occasion the chief marked the quick,&#xD;
sharp look which he threw into the forest, 'and&#xD;
seemed to fathom his thoughts.&#xD;
"Now-the Pale Face begins to act the womab.&#xD;
Now his white heart begins to tremble, and he&#xD;
looks about for help, but," he added, exultingly,&#xD;
" who can follow the trail of the Oneidas "&#xD;
"Yes," repeated his grim followers, ' who can&#xD;
follow the trail of the -Oneidas ?" and they&#xD;
glanced triumphantly at the prisoner and each&#xD;
other.,&#xD;
"I know of one who can track them with his&#xD;
eyes shut," replied Montour.&#xD;
" Speak his name," said the chief.&#xD;
" He is called the scout of the Susquehanna,"&#xD;
returned the prisoner.&#xD;
"I have heard of him, and am going to take&#xD;
h scalp," rejoined one of the braves.&#xD;
A young boy, who has never been on the&#xD;
war-path, should be silent and listen to the talk&#xD;
of chiefs and warriors," returned Roland, most&#xD;
sarcastically.&#xD;
" It is very wisely said," added the chief, and&#xD;
the young brave hung his head with shame.&#xD;

. THE ROYAL GREENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
On the ensuing night more time was taken of Roland, but a second glance dispelled that&#xD;
for rest, for having travelled rapidly, the Oneidas thought.&#xD;
believed that they were now beyond pursuit.   While'he was watching this singular prelen-&#xD;

incident of the previous night, and wondered if river.&#xD;
it had the least foundation in reality ; and at the " There's a canoe concealed here somewhere,"&#xD;

&#xD;
NETTHER of the parties spoke for some time,&#xD;
but plied the paddles in silence; but while they&#xD;
were thus gliding swiftly down the fair Susque.&#xD;
hanna, Montour found time to think of his happy&#xD;
escape and his strange deliverer. Had the&#xD;
scout himself followed the  trail and effected&#xD;
his rescue, the event would have awakened no&#xD;
surprise ; but that he should owe his liberation&#xD;
to one who might properly be considered a stran-&#xD;
ger, was an incident well calculated to excite&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
There were many things to betaken into con-&#xD;
sideration, relating to the whole affair, that he&#xD;
could not well understand. He wished to know&#xD;
how he-Lawson-had become acquainted with&#xD;
the fact of his capture, and where or how he&#xD;
had learned the difficult feat of tracing an Indian&#xD;
trail; but as he was evidently not disposed to be&#xD;
communicative, he did not press the subject&#xD;
upon his attention. He pictured to himself the&#xD;
disappointment of the Oneidas, when awaking&#xD;
from their profound slumbers, they.should .dis.&#xD;
cger the escape of their prisoner, and the pecu-&#xD;
liar circumstances attending the same--the less&#xD;
of their fire-arms.&#xD;
The reader must have seen by the account&#xD;
given of that achievement, that it would have&#xD;
been very easy for Lawson and our hero to have&#xD;
slain the natives on the spot; ).ut feelings of&#xD;
&#xD;
humanity, coupled with the wish to prove to the&#xD;
chief and his warriors that they were not the&#xD;
most cunning people to be found and the hard-&#xD;
est to circumvent, had induced them to take the&#xD;
course they had. Montour was glad that Law-&#xD;
son had determined upon such a procedure, for&#xD;
he was tired of beholding the shedding of blood,&#xD;
and of participating in such transactions, when&#xD;
any other course could be pursued with safety.&#xD;
Another consideration served to ,influence&#xD;
them to mercy; the Oneidas, though belonging&#xD;
to the Iroquois confederacy, were somewhat&#xD;
divided in their sentiments respecting the policy&#xD;
of making war upon the whites ; and some of&#xD;
them had already avowed their determination to&#xD;
remain neutral, while a very few were inclined&#xD;
to take sides with the settlers against their Eng-&#xD;
lish and tory enemies.&#xD;
The chief whomn we have named as the leader&#xD;
of the little war-party, was in fact a Seneca; but&#xD;
to strengthen the waning faith of the Oneidas, -&#xD;
he professed a great friendship for them. He&#xD;
was to a certain extent successful; and obtained&#xD;
considerable influence over the minds of a few&#xD;
young braves who thirsted for renown. Those&#xD;
into whose hands Montour had . fallen, were&#xD;
nothing more than a scouting party, led by the&#xD;
wily Seneca, who wished, by involving them in&#xD;
some midnight onset in which some atrocious&#xD;

48                            THE ROYA&#xD;
deed should be committed, to fully implicate the&#xD;
Oneidas, and identify them with the sanguinary&#xD;
plots of the Six Nations.&#xD;
When it should be known to the settlements&#xD;
on the Susquehanna, that the Oneidas had gone&#xD;
on the war-path, and taken scalps or acted as&#xD;
spies, they would cease to tamper with them and&#xD;
reckon them as others of the Iroquois league.&#xD;
It was thus that the politic Seneca reasoned, and&#xD;
by talking smoothly to his "cousins," produced&#xD;
the infpression that he gloried in calling himself&#xD;
an Oneida; for said he, "A, great many moons&#xD;
ago the Senecas and Oneidas were but one peo-&#xD;
ple, dwelt in the same country, hunted in the&#xD;
same woods, and went on the war-path together;&#xD;
while their women planted the Indian corn side&#xD;
by side, and took down and set up the lodges&#xD;
like sisters.'3&#xD;
Thus it will be perceived that it would have&#xD;
been highly impolitic for Lawson and Montour&#xD;
to have slain this little party of Oneidas, whose&#xD;
actions had been so much stimulated by the&#xD;
cunning discourses of the -Seneca ; while the&#xD;
latter, in turn, had been encouraged and set on&#xD;
by Colonel Butler, who-was anxious to involve&#xD;
the Oneidas in the war to such an extent that&#xD;
they could not withdraw from the league. The&#xD;
result-of the policypursued by our hero and the&#xD;
stranger, will be seen as we proceed with our&#xD;
story.&#xD;
They afterwardlearned, that with the first&#xD;
faint streaks of daylight, 'the-warriors awoke,&#xD;
and springing up from their conch of leaves,&#xD;
missed their prisoner. They glanced at each&#xD;
other in alarm, and then looked for their guns.&#xD;
Shame and anger struggled in their untutored&#xD;
breasts with terrible power, when they discover-&#xD;
ed the trick that had been played upon them.&#xD;
With their faces fixed upon the ground, no&#xD;
one cared to speak. They knew that they had&#xD;
been fully in the reach of the white man's ven-&#xD;
geence, and doubted not that hehad spared them&#xD;
in very contempt for their weakness and want of&#xD;
skill, and not through feelings of mercy. This&#xD;
idea  seemed to increase their confusion, and&#xD;
made them think that they cut .a contemptible&#xD;
figure as warribra*.&#xD;
They sat down, smoked in mournful silence,&#xD;
and tried to think of means of retrieving their&#xD;
tarnished honor. What would their people sad&#xD;
of them when they reached home without scajps;&#xD;
prisoners, or arms" Would they not be met&#xD;
with contempt, and jeered at by those who had&#xD;
trodden the war-path successfully ?  Such were&#xD;

&#xD;
THE ROYAL GREENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
some 6f the reflections of the little party of na-&#xD;
tives, while our hero was passing rapidly down&#xD;
the river toward the valley.&#xD;
Suddenly Roland ceased to ply the"paddle,&#xD;
and fixed his eyes upon a clump of trees upon&#xD;
the bank.&#xD;
"What do- you see ?" asked Lawson.&#xD;
" Human figures,'t replied Montour.&#xD;
"Your eyes are sharp, young man," said the&#xD;
other.              -&#xD;
" Constant watchfulness has made me quick&#xD;
of sight, although I cannot well claim any supe-&#xD;
riority over you in that respect, judging by the&#xD;
specimen which you have given of your skill in&#xD;
tracing a trail," rejoined Roland.&#xD;
"Ah, my young friend, I was once more&#xD;
skilled in woodcraft than at present; buta resi-&#xD;
dence of some years amid other scenes, has some-&#xD;
what lessened my ability to -detect a sign or&#xD;
level a rifle with accuracy. But keep a good&#xD;
watch of yonder growth of timber. Do you see&#xD;
anything now ?"&#xD;
"I do-men in green uniforms-let us hug the&#xD;
other shore-they are some of Butler's rangers."&#xD;
" Hold ! I see forms on-the other bank also"&#xD;
exclaimed Lawson.&#xD;
" Right, sir-I perceive  them-dressed in&#xD;
green, too. The middle of the river, then, only&#xD;
remains to us."&#xD;
S" We may take the middle of the river, but&#xD;
we cannot pass yonder point in safety. We&#xD;
shall certainly be fired upon from both banks."&#xD;
Both quickly reversed their strokes; stopped&#xD;
the motion of the canoe; and forced it back sev-&#xD;
eral yards against the current by their energetic&#xD;
efforts.&#xD;
They now naturally queried what course it&#xD;
was most proper to pursue under the circum-&#xD;
stances. To go forward or backward would be&#xD;
attended with danger, for the designs of the to-&#xD;
ries were already sufficiently manifest.&#xD;
"There is but little time to -deliberate-we&#xD;
must act* with decision. What do you ,re-&#xD;
commend ?" asked Montour.&#xD;
" I cannot well answer that question. If we&#xD;
could ma ge to get ashore above them, we&#xD;
might   r aps baffle pursuit," said Lawson.&#xD;
Immediately the head of the canoe was turned&#xD;
up stream and toward the bank. As soon as&#xD;
this movement was seen by the men on shore,&#xD;
they changed their position, those on- the left&#xD;
side 'running toward the -spot to which Montour&#xD;

two experienced woodsmen, of whose skill they&#xD;
had already received some proof by the- fall of&#xD;
one of their comrades, from a point ten times as&#xD;
remote. They paused, and no doubt internally&#xD;
cursed the order that had sent them to meet&#xD;
their death ; for they were well aware that at&#xD;
least two of therp were likely to suffer before the&#xD;
men could be secured..&#xD;
"Swim 'back !" said Montour, presenting his&#xD;
rifle at the nearest, " swim  back, for as red as&#xD;

"Don't spare them," said Lawson, in a low&#xD;
voice; "they are covered with crime, and crim-&#xD;
son with murders."&#xD;
The man who had been in advance fell back&#xD;
and suffered a bolder companion to take the&#xD;
lead.  Lawson fired at him, he sank, arose&#xD;
again, and then his less daring friend supported&#xD;
him with 'his left hand and struck out for the&#xD;
shore.&#xD;

"Now's your time, boys !" shouted the ser-&#xD;
geant. " Both of their guns are empty."  En-&#xD;
couraged by this assertion, the rangers made a&#xD;
fresh demonstration, but soon had cause to re-&#xD;
pent their rashness ; for 'they were met with&#xD;
rapid discharges, which not only extinguished&#xD;
their ardor but life itself in several instances, only&#xD;
three of the number who had taken to the water&#xD;
surviving to reach the shore, and two of those&#xD;
were severely wounded.&#xD;

Finding themselves attacked from another quar-&#xD;
ter, the remainder of the rangers fled after direct-&#xD;
ing three or four ineffectual fires at the canoe,&#xD;
leaving our friends the occupants of the field.&#xD;
With a feeling of sincere regret that human&#xD;
passions should bring men into such antago-&#xD;
nistic relations, Montour put the head, of the&#xD;
light canoe toward the shore, where the Dela-&#xD;
ware and the scout were calmly standing.&#xD;

CHAPTER X*&#xD;
EVENTS AT WYOMING.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tin sun of the second day of July arose&#xD;
bamly and bright, greeting fair Wyoming as&#xD;
pleasantly and cheerfully as it had ever in the&#xD;
past.&#xD;
-Ellen Devron and ilvira Hudson, at -a very&#xD;
early hour, before the glistening dew had dled&#xD;
from the grass, walked toward' the spot wlee&#xD;
the home of the former had once been, but; of&#xD;
which only w few blackened logs remained.&#xD;
Their kind neighbors had talked of building&#xD;
another cabin near the site of the old one, and&#xD;
some timber had already been drawn there for&#xD;
that object. As they were slowly proceeding in&#xD;
the.direction of the desolated dwelling, they saw&#xD;
Martin Secord approaching . them with hasty&#xD;
steps, and a face giving unequivocal evidences&#xD;
of excitement.,&#xD;
The maidens did not hail his appearance with&#xD;
smiles, nor did his manner-augir an interview of&#xD;
a very pleasing nature.&#xD;
"I have come, young ladies,".he said, bow-&#xD;
ing stiffly,- "to do you :an important service.&#xD;
Danger is, close at hand, and:4f you wish- for&#xD;
security, you will hasten to Fort Wintermoot '&#xD;
" We give the preference to Fort Forty," re-&#xD;
turned Elvira-&#xD;
" Fort Forty will not do 1" exclaimed Mar-&#xD;
I tell you-tiere is safety only in Winter-&#xD;
moot's Fort.''&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is the danger pressing 1" inquired Ellen.&#xD;
" So pressing that the sooner young maidens&#xD;
like you are where I have said, the better."&#xD;
"Let us go back to the cabin, then, and spread -&#xD;
the alarm; there are others who need a place of o3&#xD;
security. We are not the only maidens in the&#xD;
valley," said Miss Hudson, fixing a penetrating&#xD;
look upon Martin.&#xD;
"Be not so foolish !" cried the latter, quickly&#xD;
and -energetically. "These friendly words of&#xD;
warning are meant for you alone. Come, fol-&#xD;
low me, if you value safety or even life, for Wyo.&#xD;
ming is near the hour of its-"&#xD;
"What would you say ?" exclaimed Ellen,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
"That this valley is near the hour of that&#xD;
bloody baptism of which I spoke sometime ago,"&#xD;
said another voice, and immediately Lanaway&#xD;
stepped from the thicket near them.&#xD;
"I cannot and will not comprehend your&#xD;
meaning. If there is indeed a terrible calamity,&#xD;
such as war sometimes brings; hanging over&#xD;
Wyoming, then in gentle pity's - nAme' come&#xD;
with us' and"sound your warnings in the ears of&#xD;
those who'will make speedy preparation 'to pro-&#xD;
vide for the general good as much as conditions&#xD;
will admit. Why do you speak these words of&#xD;
mystery to young-maidens only V"&#xD;

&#xD;
however, *as not discouraged, but resolved to&#xD;
do all he could to defend the place, and protect&#xD;
the many helpless ones to be Ibund in the val-&#xD;
ley. In a particular manner did he think of&#xD;
Ellefi Devron, and he mentally and solemnly&#xD;
pledged himself to-save her froen the fury of the&#xD;
merciless foe, even at the sacrifice of life itself ;&#xD;
so deep. and lasting was the impression which&#xD;
her beauty had made on a heart naturally alive&#xD;
to an appreciation of the beautiful, and the claims&#xD;
of innocence.&#xD;
Many persons think deeply and much, without&#xD;
being suspected of anything of the kind; and1&#xD;
Montour was one of that-character. Since the&#xD;
first moment he had looked upon the pretty face&#xD;
of Ellen, her- image had been impressed upon&#xD;
his mind in such vivid colors that it could not E&#xD;
be effated without a greater effort than he was I&#xD;
disposed to make. There were seasons when her&#xD;
attempted to think less of one whom he really&#xD;
believed would never sustain a nearer and dear- I&#xD;
er relation than that she then sustained. Exer-&#xD;
tions of this nature were always attended with&#xD;
an oppressive weight of sadness, which depress-v&#xD;
ed his spirits to such a degree that nothing save s&#xD;
the excitement of the trail and the dangers of i&#xD;
some difficult  achievenwnt  could  entIrelyt&#xD;
obliterate.-              .c&#xD;
To have looked upon him while threading the a&#xD;
forest with Dunbar, and daring the perils of&#xD;
partizan malice-and Indian cunning, few would t&#xD;
have imagined the fair idea of Ellen was pictured c&#xD;
in his soul as in a clear and perfect mirror. Who e&#xD;
maiy say how much this soft reflection of the .v&#xD;
maiden nerved'his arm, and how much strength it it&#xD;
gave to his limbs when he dogged the footsteps d&#xD;
of the common enemy ; or how much it stimu- s&#xD;
lated him to put forth those efforts (in conjunc- f&#xD;
tion with the scout) which the uninitiated might&#xD;
almost have deemed superhuman. We have w&#xD;
not said,,nor do we now assert, that our hero m&#xD;
was in love; we leave that matter to make itself cc&#xD;
apparent'in due time, whether it be so or other- d4&#xD;
wise. It is not ours to anticipate ; for it is to be te&#xD;
understood that the reader has, the same chance w&#xD;
to draw conclusions that we have ; and we will ri&#xD;
not be so bold as to give ourself credit for more B&#xD;
sagacity than others having the same means of sp&#xD;
Judging-                                  so&#xD;
It is impossible to fathom well the secret m&#xD;
woerkings ff the human heart, even when it has pr&#xD;
the capacity to reflect some of its emotions on sy&#xD;
the face and in the conduct.               na&#xD;
While the "stern alarms of war " are rever- at&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
berating through the valley of Wyoming, we find&#xD;
it necessary to look at the movements of one&#xD;
who figures prominently-in-these chapters-.Dun.&#xD;
bar-honest, upright Dunbar-a man who loves&#xD;
the right because it agrees best with his noble&#xD;
nature--a person rough'in external seeming, but&#xD;
sensitive as a woman in all that pertains to the&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
We perceive him   approaching a dwelling a&#xD;
few miles below Mr. Hudson's, 'with slow and&#xD;
thoughtful steps. Sometimes he pauses and&#xD;
passes his hand across his brow as if to render&#xD;
his ideas more lucid and quicken'his powers of&#xD;
perception. He is obviously at a loss in regard&#xD;
to some important matter, and not only per-&#xD;
plexed but also troubled, providing we take his&#xD;
expression as a true index of his feelings. With&#xD;
his rifle in the hollow of his flexed arm, he&#xD;
reaches the door and knocks.&#xD;
During the short interval that elapses before&#xD;
his modest summons is answered, his sun-burned&#xD;
visage gives fresh evidence of a mind much agi-&#xD;
tated. He hears a light step upon the floor&#xD;
within, and his.stout heart beats with rapid pul-&#xD;
ations. What magic is there in a footstep, that&#xD;
t can so affect one who is so venturesome on the&#xD;
rail, so daring where there is danger, so calm,&#xD;
ool and self-reliant when those very, qualities&#xD;
re necessary to secure success ?&#xD;
The door opens, and a female, of'perhaps&#xD;
wenty-two summers,' stands before him, who&#xD;
hanges color, is confused ; but instantly recov-&#xD;
ring her equanimity, bids our hero enter. And.&#xD;
while the first common-place greetings are being&#xD;
interchanged, we will take the (we hope) par-&#xD;
onable liberty of stealing a few inquisitive and&#xD;
scrutinizing glances at the young lady's form and&#xD;
features.&#xD;
Although she may have reached the age which&#xD;
re have named, -those years seem none too&#xD;
nany to develop a beauty like hers; for she is&#xD;
certainly blessed with what even the most pru-&#xD;
ent Quaker might safely call a "comely coun-&#xD;
nance."  She is not gifted with that loveliness&#xD;
hich is merely physical, but that which is de-&#xD;
ved from a pure, truth-loving and natural soul.&#xD;
y the last adjective we mean that.she was not&#xD;
oiled by those artificial accomplishments that&#xD;
D often turn the minds of so many youthful&#xD;
aidens dwelling in cities. Her figure is of such&#xD;
oportions that it at once gives the idea of&#xD;
mmetry, and that without taxing the imagi-&#xD;
tion. But it is not her person that so much&#xD;

which he had placed against the wall within&#xD;
reach. The pretty Quakeress (for such she was)&#xD;
relieved his embarrassment by asking in a soft&#xD;
and pleasing voice' which sounded wondrously&#xD;
musical to Dunbar's ears: -&#xD;
"What news bringest thou, friend David ?"&#xD;
The scout remained silent an instant,-and then&#xD;
replied :  -&#xD;
" News that you will not be glad to hear, Miss&#xD;
Hammond."&#xD;
" That may well be said, for it has been long&#xD;
since we have heard aught save of wars and r'&#xD;
morse of wars."&#xD;
"Where is your father and William ?"'&#xD;
"They have gone forth to muster the men,&#xD;
to prepare for the defence of our ill-fated settle-&#xD;
ment ; although it is against their principles to&#xD;
draw the sword."                       '&#xD;
"In these times, Miss Hammond, all men&#xD;
who love liberty, of whatever sect they may be,&#xD;
maty take arms, I reckon, in the defence of their&#xD;
homes and their rights," said the scout, casting&#xD;
a furtive glance at his comely companion.&#xD;
"I am fully of thy opinion, David, although&#xD;
once I thought differently. The simple fe of&#xD;
existence has to be kept with the sword;' for&#xD;
these enemies of ours have no mercy-pityneither&#xD;
young uor old-respect not gray hairs, nor soften&#xD;
at the sight of beauty in distress." ,&#xD;
" I have come to tell you, Miss Hammond-"&#xD;
" Thou mayest call me Hester, David." .&#xD;
" To tell you that there will be a battle here&#xD;
to-morrow.".&#xD;
"A battle, sayest.thou I"'    -&#xD;
"Ay, a great and decisive battle, as I may&#xD;
,say,"          i.          .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Friend David, thou art 'a man of sound&#xD;
judgment and of honest purpose, and- I desire&#xD;
that thou wilt tell me frankly what thy opinion&#xD;
is, of the result of the battle of which thou&#xD;
speakest ?"&#xD;
"Miss Hester, I will answer you with that&#xD;
bluntness that constitutes a part of my nateral&#xD;
disposition, as 'twere. It is my solemn belief&#xD;
that we 'shall be beaten in the fight of to-morro .&#xD;
Fort Wintermoot will be given up to the enemy&#xD;
this night, unless I can muster enough men to&#xD;
repulse the'advancing tories and Senecas.",&#xD;
" Wintermoot is false, then ?"&#xD;
"False as the great deceiver himself, as I may&#xD;
say !"&#xD;
" If thou sayest it, .1 can believe thee, friend&#xD;
David ; but thou wilt find few that are equally&#xD;
credulous."&#xD;
" I have heard, Miss Hammond, - that one of&#xD;
the Wintermoots was highly thought of here-&#xD;
-by your father and brother," added the scout,&#xD;
with evident effort.&#xD;
" I know to what thou dost refer, but perhaps&#xD;
thou art laboring under some delusion in the&#xD;
matter. It is true that he has at times been quite&#xD;
attentive here, but-I tiink I may assert that he&#xD;
has received no encouragement from me to-&#xD;
to lengthen his visits or make them more fre-&#xD;
quent," said Miss Hammond, looking steadily&#xD;
upon the floor, and exhibiting upon her 'hand-&#xD;
some features something 'like a well defined&#xD;
blush.&#xD;

"What I have to communicate is very im-&#xD;

joinder.&#xD;
"I wait to hear thee speak, sir," was the quiet&#xD;
response.&#xD;
"Mr. Dunbar," said Wintermoot, desperately,&#xD;
I wish to confer a few moments with Miss Ham-&#xD;
mond on important and strictly private matters ;&#xD;
will, you oblige me by leaving the room ?"&#xD;
"The instant Miss Hammond desires me to&#xD;
go, I will do so without delay," the scout&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
The face and brow of Wintermoot flushed&#xD;
with anger, and turning to the maiden, he said,&#xD;
in a lower tone of voice:&#xD;
Miss Hammond, I came here out of pure&#xD;
regard to you to do you a service. I have dis-&#xD;
covered that it will be no longer safe for you to&#xD;

"Where would thee recommend me to go ?"&#xD;

"Let me say to you," added, Wintermoot in&#xD;

name is the"only place of safety in Wyoming."&#xD;
"When my friends return, I will not fail to&#xD;
ask their advice, for I cannot think of acting&#xD;
without their consent."&#xD;
" "You must decide quickly ; while you* are&#xD;
deliberating this chance of safety may pass,"&#xD;
said Wintermoot, earnestly..&#xD;
"As I have said, I will consult my friends."&#xD;
" Miss Hammond-you must go now ; I have&#xD;
come on purpose to attend you to the fort."&#xD;
. I decline'going with thee."&#xD;
If you have any friendship for me-"&#xD;
" Nay, I have but little friendship for thee."&#xD;
Wintermoot seemedutterly confounded by the&#xD;
calm avowal of the maiden.&#xD;
"And why is your friendship . for me so&#xD;
Might ?" he asked, coloring with vexation.&#xD;
"I will tell thee frankly; because thou art&#xD;
false to thy country, and leagued with the ene-&#xD;
mies of peace and liberty," said Miss Hammond,&#xD;
-t ormly-.-e&#xD;
By heavens, this is your work.!" exclaimed&#xD;
&#xD;
Wintermoot, starting to his feet and advancing&#xD;
toward Dunbar with his eyes flashing fury.&#xD;
" I have never yet called you a Tory to your&#xD;
face (although I have given some hints that&#xD;
couldn't well be mistaken), but now I call you as&#xD;
villanous a tory as ever conspired agin an honest&#xD;
man, fired a dwelling, or killed a neighbor in&#xD;
cool blood i".said the scout, without betraying&#xD;
the least agitation.&#xD;
" Spying, lying, scouting scoundrels"  ex-&#xD;
claimed Wintermoot, fiercely.&#xD;
Dunbar arose from  his seat, and without a&#xD;
word doubled his fist and knocked the torydown;&#xD;
then seizing him by the collar, dragged him to&#xD;
the door and thrust him out. This was done so&#xD;
quickly that.Miss Hammond scarcely knew what&#xD;
was transpiring until she heard the door close,&#xD;
and the bolt that secured it move into its place.&#xD;
"Pardos me, Miss Hester, for doing such a&#xD;
thing in your presence, but I couldn't listen to&#xD;
his talk any longer. *He is such a traitor that I&#xD;
have no feeling's in common with him, as&#xD;
'twero."&#xD;
" I don't reproach thee, David; I only fear&#xD;
that he will do thee mischief before he departs.&#xD;
I will look from the window and observe their&#xD;
movements."&#xD;
"What are they doing, Hester?"&#xD;
" They are giving Wintermoot a drink from a&#xD;
canteen. Verily, he seems much affected' by&#xD;
the blow thou didst deal him. Now they are&#xD;

"And what ?"&#xD;
"'They have fastened it to a branch of the red&#xD;

" No matter, Hester, what it means, do not let&#xD;
it trouble you. I may say that I'm a host, as&#xD;
'twere, and don't fear no half-dozen royalists in&#xD;
the country.'&#xD;
" They willtake thyfe ; is there no way of&#xD;

"1I don't think I shall die in that sort of way,&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE NIGHT MARCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
' *&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
BETWEEN the hours of twelve and one, on&#xD;
the ensuing night, a small party of men were&#xD;
moving silently up the Susquehanna. Among&#xD;
them might have -been seen, acting as leaders,&#xD;
Roland Montour, David Dunbar, Devron and&#xD;
Castanego the Delaware chief. The latter led&#xD;
twenty of his people, and some ten or -fifteen&#xD;
Oneidas, who had recently summoned courage&#xD;
to side with the defenders of Wyoming. All&#xD;
counted, whites and Indians, the party did not&#xD;
exceed seventy-five. Their object ,was to inter-&#xD;
cept the Royal Greens and Senecas, then de-&#xD;
scending the river to take possession of Fort&#xD;
Winternoot.-                     -&#xD;
Great exertions had been made by Montour&#xD;
and Dunbar, to raise a large body of Delawares&#xD;
in addition to the men of Wyoming ; but their&#xD;
efforts had been rewarded with but*indifferent&#xD;
success. The dwellers in the valley, as wehave&#xD;
previously stated, were 'not disposed to believe&#xD;
implicitly in the treachery of- the- Wintermoots&#xD;
and Lanaway ; and therefore did not feel. in-&#xD;
clined to engage in what they suspected miight&#xD;
be- after all but a silly and fruitless crusade by&#xD;
night, up the Susquehanna, to meet an imaginary&#xD;
foe. And so infatuated were many of the in-&#xD;
habitants, that they did-not, until the following&#xD;
day, yield credence to the rumor -that Colonel&#xD;
Butler and his Tory Rangers meditated -'an at-&#xD;
&#xD;
tack. It may be asked why Montour and the&#xD;
scout 'did not take some effectual measures to&#xD;
secure the persons of Wintermoot and Lanaway,&#xD;
, takd'possession of the fort, and thus stop the&#xD;
conspiracy.at once. . The reader will be kind&#xD;
enough to bear in mind, that the stockade ment&#xD;
tioned, was built with the .ostensible purpose of&#xD;
defending the valley, and b'y men professing to be&#xD;
its friends ; and as friends they were generally'&#xD;
considered.&#xD;
Taking this view of the case, it would have&#xD;
required a considerable force to arrest them, and&#xD;
a body of armed men neither Montour nor Dun-&#xD;
bar had at their command. Could they have&#xD;
mustered a sufficient company, and been ac-&#xD;
knowledged as military leaders by the same,&#xD;
their first step would have been to make them-&#xD;
selves masters of the fort; but as this was not&#xD;
'the case, they took the only step that remained&#xD;
for their choice ;, for there were more persons&#xD;
willing to march up the river to see if the enemy&#xD;
were really approaching, and if so to 'resist their&#xD;
advance, than to be the gst to lay violent hands&#xD;
on men who had been hnd. still were, by the&#xD;
majority of the people, considered very good&#xD;
friends to the country and the patriot cause.&#xD;
Even now, as they moved-forward, there were&#xD;
many incredulous ones among them, who spoke&#xD;

62                           THE ROYAL&#xD;
dubious way. Two or, three of the party took&#xD;
particular pains to encourage such feelings, and&#xD;
the low whisperings grew into audible mutter-&#xD;
ings as they passed slowly along.&#xD;
" I said from the beginning that this would&#xD;
be a wild goose chase 1" exclaimed one of the&#xD;
grumblers to the man who' was nearest him,&#xD;
whose name was Vanalstine.&#xD;
"And didn't I say so, too, neighbor ?"&#xD;
The person who had made the observation to&#xD;
which this was an answer, knew very well that&#xD;
Vanalstine had been the direct cause of his own&#xD;
discontented mutterings ; but he was ambitious&#xD;
to appear as wise as others who affected to know&#xD;
much that they had no knowledge of.&#xD;
"What's the use of going any farther ?" said&#xD;
another.&#xD;
")But little good will come of it," added&#xD;
Vanalstine.&#xD;
" This young man Montour, and this Dunbar,&#xD;
take a great deal on their shoulders, I fancy.&#xD;
How comes it, friends, that they know so much&#xD;
*more than we do about the movements of But-&#xD;
ler ?" continued a fourth.&#xD;
"Yes, that's the very question that I want&#xD;
somebody to answer," said a fifth.&#xD;
"My good neighbors," resumed Vanalstine,&#xD;
" I have no confidence in these men. They are&#xD;
comparatively strangers among us (or the yohng-&#xD;
est is at least), and I cannot see,-for one, why&#xD;
they are entitled to our confidence."'&#xD;
"No talking' there, men, no talking ' 1" said&#xD;
Dunbar, coming up at that moment, and hearing&#xD;
the murmur of voices.&#xD;
" You see he takes a vast deal of authority on&#xD;
himself," added the one who had last spoken, as&#xD;
soon is the scout had passed on.&#xD;
" That's the natur of sich people," returned&#xD;
the man on his left.&#xD;
" I think," continued Vanalstine, " that some-&#xD;
thing might be done to put an end to this dis&#xD;
graceful march."&#xD;
"There are several of that opinion," was the&#xD;
immediate response of another grumbler.&#xD;
It was certain that the party was divided in&#xD;
sentiment, and that that unanimity without which&#xD;
success is never certain, and always doubtful,&#xD;
was an element that w wanting, "to a serious&#xD;
extent. All these unhappy divisions, that fatal&#xD;
feeling of security which pervaded so many&#xD;
minds, had been artfully induced by the royalists,&#xD;
who, living in their yery midst and seeing them&#xD;
every day, improved every opportunity to prop&#xD;
duce false impressions and to spread reports of&#xD;
&#xD;
"  4N&#xD;
sll-&#xD;
/ I&#xD;
&#xD;
L GREENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
the pacific intentions of the, enemy, which they&#xD;
were aware 'would be instrumental in working&#xD;
their ruin, if accredited. Had these internal&#xD;
enemies openly avowed their true sentiments,&#xD;
the mischief would not have been wrought; but&#xD;
this they were far too politic to do ; so the in-&#xD;
habitants of the valley walked daily over a hid-&#xD;
den mine, which could be sprung at any moment.&#xD;
While this state of things existed, it was almost,.&#xD;
or quite, impossible to make any important&#xD;
movement in secrecy ; for it was not easy to&#xD;
know who to trust; and the reader will not be&#xD;
surprised to learn that there were unfriendly&#xD;
ones even among those 'who were following&#xD;
Montour and the scout, to meet the approaching&#xD;
rangers.&#xD;
The former paused ; and while watching the&#xD;
little army as it defiled along its winding way,&#xD;
querying whether they would fight when the&#xD;
hour of trial came, the Delaware glided to his&#xD;
side with a quick and noiseless step. At the&#xD;
same instant Montour heard the voices of the&#xD;
malcontents and prophets of evil, of whom-we&#xD;
have just spoken, and exclaimed in a low but&#xD;
stern tone ;       ~&#xD;
"Be silent, men--be silent I"&#xD;
The Delaware laughed derisively, but said'&#xD;
nothing.&#xD;
Roland turned a searching glance upon him&#xD;
and asked&#xD;
" What mean you, Castanego ?"&#xD;
"Scorn and AngerI" replied the Delaware.&#xD;
"And for what ?" continued the young man.&#xD;
" The folly and hollow-heartedness of these&#xD;
people !" retorted the Lenape.&#xD;
"My brother is wise in the workings of the&#xD;
hnman mind, and can read well the language of&#xD;
the face when the lips are silent. What have&#xD;
you seen or heard that disturbs you ?"&#xD;
"Did not my brother hear those voices- ?"&#xD;
said the Delaware, sharply.&#xD;
"Ieheard them."-&#xD;
" What did they sound like ?"&#xD;
Montour paused to reflect, and then replied :&#xD;
." It strikes me that they were like the mutter-&#xD;
ed tones of discontent."&#xD;
"Let them go to the Iroquois, where- their&#xD;
hearts are. They are full of-lies, and are afraid&#xD;
of the,sound of battle. They are hissing their&#xD;
poisoned words in the ears of others, and soon&#xD;
your men will refuse to go on."~      .&#xD;
" I know that the Delaware has sharp eyes,&#xD;
and never sees 'things that are not ; therefore&#xD;
this must be looked to."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROYA&#xD;
&#xD;
" Walk near them and your own ears shall be&#xD;
opened to their bad talk ; and your own eyes&#xD;
shall see their hollow-heartedness."&#xD;
Montour followed the suggestion of the Dela-&#xD;
ware, and soon had proof of the truth of his&#xD;
assertions.&#xD;
Having satisfied himself on that point, he&#xD;
sought Diubar (who was among the foremost of&#xD;
the party, where his duty as leader would natu-&#xD;
rally place him), andcommunicated to him what&#xD;
he had discovered, and the influence which these&#xD;
doubtful friends were exerting upon the men.&#xD;
A halt was then ordered, and the scout, Devron,&#xD;
the Delaware, and our hero held a hurried coun-&#xD;
cil. In order that their' deliberations might be,&#xD;
of a private nature, they withdrew a few yards&#xD;
from the main body, anid were earnestly discuss-&#xD;
ing the subject, when the quick eyes of the Dela-&#xD;
ware perceived that there was considerable.com-&#xD;
motion among the men.&#xD;
" The false pale face is giving them a talk,"&#xD;
he said, moodily, contracting his dark brow.&#xD;
"Vanalstine is haranguing them," added&#xD;
Devron.&#xD;
" Let us go and hear what he has to say,"&#xD;
said Dunbar, and accordingly the parties ap-&#xD;
proached the scene they had just left, where the&#xD;
undisciplined soldiers were huddled together.&#xD;
round Vanalstine, listening to his speech. We&#xD;
will not attempt to repeat it word for word, bu4&#xD;
merely give the purport of it.&#xD;
He assured them' that they had been deceived&#xD;
in regard to the intentions of Colonel John But-&#xD;
ler and the Six Nations-deceived, 'too, by the&#xD;
very men who were now pretending to lead them&#xD;
to meet.an enemy--an enemy who, happily, had&#xD;
no existence save in their, imaginations. He&#xD;
went on to say that they had patiently marched&#xD;
several miles without so much as venturing to&#xD;
speak for fear of alarming the ruthless invaders&#xD;
of Wyoming, and giving them notice of their&#xD;
approach. But what had come of it ? Nothing&#xD;
at all. They had as yet seen no enemies against&#xD;
which to direct their' arms ; and the probability&#xD;
.was, that they might wait-there a week with a&#xD;
similar result..&#xD;
" Now," he added, with a grand flourish of&#xD;
his right hand, "the question is, shall we go&#xD;
home to our families, and retire to bed to re-&#xD;
fresh ourselves for the peaceful toils of to-mor-&#xD;
row, or shall we continue this silly march under&#xD;
the command of men who know as little about&#xD;
the intentions of Butler as we do ? For one he&#xD;
was in favor of the former course, unless they&#xD;

L GREENS.                               63&#xD;
preferred to kindle some large fires and pass the&#xD;
night on the spot."&#xD;
"Villain i" exclaimed. Montour.. "He is&#xD;
desirous to sacrifice these unsuspecting men, as&#xD;
a sort of propitiatory offering to the tories and&#xD;
savages."&#xD;
"Yes, that's it precisely," replied Danbar;&#xD;
"but if they refuse to follow us, they will soon&#xD;
receive a bitter lesson for their foolish obstinacy.&#xD;
You'd better try and reason with them, Mr.&#xD;
Montour; you understand talkin' better nor I&#xD;
do, for I aint remarkably bleA with the gift of&#xD;
gab, as 'twere."&#xD;
" I will remoistrate with them, though.I fear&#xD;
it will do little good,"-he answered, and'mount-&#xD;
ing a log thus addressed the men of Wyoming.&#xD;
" Neighbors and friends, I need not remind&#xD;
you that we are surrounded by pitiless foes, for&#xD;
the experience of the last few months must have&#xD;
made you as sensible-of this fact as I am, or any&#xD;
'other person. We have certain knowledge that&#xD;
Butler with hls Tory Rangers, and a; large body&#xD;
of Senecas, are coming down the river. We&#xD;
have, furthermore, the best of reasons for believ-&#xD;
ingthat the stockade, known as Fort Winter-&#xD;
moot, will be betrayed into the hands of our&#xD;
enemies before the sun rises again. We call&#xD;
-upon you as men, and lovers of your country,&#xD;
to stand by us and' resist the advance of the&#xD;
enemy, as long as you can wield a weapon in&#xD;
defence of those you love, and who lool to you&#xD;
for protection. The man who'has just address-&#xD;
ed you, must be either a fool or a knave, for he&#xD;
counsels you to neglect your own safety and&#xD;
sleep; while the sleepless Senecas and merciless&#xD;
rangers are hanging upon your border, and per-&#xD;
haps even now within rifle range of where we&#xD;
stand. Follow his advice if you wish for cer'&#xD;
tain destruction; but before the red sun comes&#xD;
up again, you will deeply, ay, most painfully&#xD;
regret your folly."&#xD;
At this point in his speech, Montour felt him-&#xD;
self touched upon the shoulder, and perceived&#xD;
one whom he had not expected to see, beside&#xD;
him-.-Lawson.&#xD;
"Cease to reason with them," he said. "They&#xD;
are infatuated, and nothing short of the chastise-&#xD;
ment which they will soon receive, and which&#xD;
they richly merit, will suffice to bring them to&#xD;
their senses."&#xD;
" You've spoken my own sentiments exactly,"&#xD;
said Dunbar, who stood near our hero and heard&#xD;
Lawson's remark. " The cunnin' of the tories&#xD;
has, so sprinkled dust in their eyes, that they&#xD;

The men of the valley now1 looked wistfully  The position which they now took was one&#xD;
at each other, and then conversed together in well calculated for the concealment pf\ a large&#xD;

home.                                     nature, our friends led their volunteer forces,&#xD;
When Dunbar heard this resolution proclaim- until they judged. they were opposite those whom&#xD;

in his rough but earnest way, calling on such to This movement was effected without noise,&#xD;

said the scout. " It wont' do for a mere hand- selves to be under better discipline than the&#xD;

This proposal was readily agreed to ; for it  " What does my brother call that ?" asked the&#xD;
seenied the only prudent thipg that they could other, pointing towards the river.&#xD;
do, except returning to the valley, which they  Looking steadfastly in the direction indicated,&#xD;
did not wish to do from considerations of mercy, our hero saw a smallcolumn of smoke ascending&#xD;
knowing that those deluded ones who had listen= through the trees, which gradually increased inÂ°&#xD;

with joy and pride, which not all their rough,&#xD;

It was now proposed by the sturdy scout, that,&#xD;
one of their number should cautiously approach&#xD;
the spot where Vanalstine, and those Who had&#xD;
been so iUnwise as to heed his. oufsel, Were'&#xD;

their blankets'around the fire, and most of those-&#xD;
careless and simple ones were lying upoq them I&#xD;
while a few appeared to be already asleep, and&#xD;
about an equal number sat talking, smoking or&#xD;
dozing.&#xD;
Roland looked about for Vanalstine, and final-&#xD;
ly discovered him on that side nearest where he&#xD;
(Montour) was standing and farthest from the&#xD;
fire., Presently the low murmur of voices ceas-&#xD;
ed, and: the poor fellows, tired out with the&#xD;
fatigues of the-night, sunk to sleep with scarcely&#xD;

a watch, but her voice was not heard,.or ifheard&#xD;

ing at the slumbering ones an instant, he touch-&#xD;
ed his friend with' the butt of his usket, when&#xD;
he also got up;thea the two walked sfty&#xD;
from the scene, and almost in a direct line for&#xD;
the spot where Roland was standing. To re-&#xD;
main perfectly motionless was the best way of&#xD;
escaping discovery, and so he kept his position&#xD;
like a statue.&#xD;
This expedient proved successful, and the&#xD;
traitors passed within three yards of him-thanks&#xD;
to the dense clouds of smoke and the sheltering&#xD;
foliage'!'&#xD;
When.they had procieded so far beyond his&#xD;
hiding-place that their figures could withdificul-&#xD;
ty be discerned gliding spectre-like along amid,&#xD;
the trees, Montour thought it his duty to follow&#xD;
them and attempt to unmask their purpose. He&#xD;
had gone not far when he saw the t)elaware,&#xD;
manifestly engaged in a similar pursuit. He was&#xD;
on the point of. speaking to him, when he was&#xD;
spared that trouble, the Lenape being already&#xD;
conscious of his propinqity, as he speedily sig-&#xD;
niied by a significant'gesture, then pausing until&#xD;
Roland joined him.&#xD;

"There's evidently an understandin' atween&#xD;

that they're expectin' something' or somebody."&#xD;
" Of their intentions there is not room -for the&#xD;
shadow of a doubt," replied Montour.&#xD;
" Then our duty is plain, and we can't pre-&#xD;
tend to misunderstand it," added the scout.&#xD;
"I don't know that I exactly comprehend,"&#xD;
resulted the young man.&#xD;
"If you do not, here is one at my side as does&#xD;

The Delaware made a motion toward his gun)&#xD;
and smiled grimly.&#xD;
" It may be needful," said Montour.&#xD;

where the shadow of the back-ground would&#xD;
affect them less. After much effort, and run-&#xD;
ning some risk of discovery by their movements,&#xD;
they reached a large rock, behind, *hich they&#xD;
could stand, and over *hich they could look&#xD;
and see Vanalstine and his companioti, but still&#xD;
obscured by the misty veil thrown forward by.&#xD;
the hill.&#xD;
The, eout paused an instant ; something like&#xD;
a sigh of regret escaped him, and then making a&#xD;
motion to the Delaware, he raised his long'rifle.&#xD;
The breech had nearly pressed his shoulder,&#xD;
when again a feeling of irresolution or compunC-&#xD;
titm appeared to arrest his hand, and he let the&#xD;
weapon drop gently to the earth.&#xD;
" It isn't because I'm a- coward, Delaware.&#xD;

tour, in the same voice.&#xD;
"Enought   enough " said the.Delaw re.&#xD;

Dunbar passed his hand over his forehead, and&#xD;
an expression of sadness, deep and palpable&#xD;
played upon his sune-burned face.&#xD;
"What now ought to be done " anxiously&#xD;
inquired Montour.&#xD;
"Wait," returned the Delaware, "wait til&#xD;
they sweep round the bend into sight, that&#xD;
may see how many."&#xD;
"Good advice-brt these two men mustn't o&#xD;

The sounds grew snore audible momentarily&#xD;
and in five minutes the foremost of the boat&#xD;
shot round the bend ; they were filled with me&#xD;

dressing one of the boats.&#xD;

" There I" hissed Dunbar, "my feeling's of&#xD;
humanity are gone. Delaware, take the one on&#xD;

This time Dunbar's rifle went briskly to his&#xD;
shoulder, and his keen, gray eyes seemed to&#xD;
travel along, the barrel with right goodwill,&#xD;
Montour could see, by the moonbeams, that his&#xD;
honsest-looking face Was flashed with indigna&#xD;

and resolute as ithad been hesitating, undecided&#xD;

The men of the valley trned their faces earn. There was little need now to admonish them&#xD;

L GE'ENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
70                             THE ROYA&#xD;
detachment of the enemy, fell upon their knees,&#xD;
and begged stoutly for mercy.&#xD;
Up, fools I" exclairged Dunbar; "up, and&#xD;
show yourselves men and not cowards."&#xD;
Some of the flying ones, as soon as they saw&#xD;
how matters really were, fell in with the men,&#xD;
and looking very penitent and sheepish, kept on&#xD;
with them ; while others Bed like persons depriv-&#xD;
ed of their senses.&#xD;
Arrived at the river, below the spot where&#xD;
the-fire had been kindled,'Montour and the scout&#xD;
arranged their somewhat motley army in the way&#xD;
that would best enable them to pour effectual&#xD;
volgys upon the enemy when the boats should&#xD;
pass. The firing abov them soon ceased; for&#xD;
those who were not slain or wounded at the first&#xD;
discharge, fled with all practicable speed in vari-&#xD;
ous directions. Bitterly, when it was too late,&#xD;
did they regret their folly, obtuseness, jealousy&#xD;
and mutiny against the authority of those whom&#xD;
they well knew ,could have no incentive to de-&#xD;
ceive or lead them wantonly into danger. Those&#xD;
whd had run off in an opposite course, would&#xD;
have given all their possessions at the. valley,&#xD;
for a single glimpse of the tall figure of the scout,&#xD;
with his calm, honest features. The few who&#xD;
hW  4   feso- fortunate as to meet the advane-&#xD;
I   '   d,&amp;amp;natives, said not a word, asked&#xD;
, but with downcast eyes and&#xD;
dropped into the ranks. No one&#xD;
for feeling conscious of their fatal&#xD;
er       that it had cost severallives, theywere&#xD;
suffiiently rebuked'&#xD;
There followed a short period of. silence,&#xD;
broken soon by the sound of paddles and, oars&#xD;
in notion. The. strange flotills drew in sight,&#xD;
presenting a startling spectacle to the, dwellers&#xD;
irk the valley--nen, however bold they might be&#xD;
in the hour, ofactual conflict, were undisciplined&#xD;
and unused' to seeing their enemies in such large&#xD;
numbers., The Indians of the league were seen&#xD;
in all their war-paint, dark, ktim and horrible,&#xD;
skimming lightly over the water in their canoes ;&#xD;
while the Royal Greens in bateaux, made up the&#xD;
rest of the unpleasant show;&#xD;
The whole of this fleet could not betaken in&#xD;
at a single glance of the eye, fpr it extended up&#xD;
the river a considerable distance.&#xD;
"What do you think of their numbers ?I" Law-&#xD;
son asked of the scout.&#xD;
"Ishould set them down at a thousand," was&#xD;
the reply.&#xD;
"A  thousand men.!"   exclaimed Devron.&#xD;
"Alas, who will protect;my child"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fear not," said Roland. "There are hands&#xD;
that will not be forgetful of the needs of the&#xD;
helpless' and the fair, among us."&#xD;
" Observe," added Lawson to Montour, "how&#xD;
grim and terrible those dusky warriors look in&#xD;
the pale moonlight."&#xD;
"I am thinking," resumed Devron, sorrow-&#xD;
fully, "where their war-cries will be heard to-&#xD;
morrow, how many ears they will-fill with des-&#xD;
pair, how many hearts they will freeze with fear.&#xD;
If I were alone in the world, much less should I&#xD;
heed this visitation--much less should I dread&#xD;
the shock of the storm ; but, friend Dunbar, I&#xD;
have a dearly loved daughter."&#xD;
"And a fair one she is, and you may well be&#xD;
proud of her," responded the scout.&#xD;
The conversation now wholly ceased, for the&#xD;
moment of action had arrived. Concealed as&#xD;
they were in the bushes 'and shrubbery, the&#xD;
enemy were wholly ignorant of their nearness,&#xD;
and consequently not anticipating the results of&#xD;
such proximity.&#xD;
Stepping to a position whereehe could be seen&#xD;
by those who now confessed his authority, Dun.&#xD;
bar waved his hand (which was the signal agreed&#xD;
upon), and the mountain ranges resounded to&#xD;
the rattle and crash of musketry, and the loud&#xD;
war-whoops of savages suddenly startled from a&#xD;
sense of security by the whistling of the deadly&#xD;
ballet and the fall of companions seated at- their&#xD;
side.&#xD;
The' whigs'and their few faithful allies then&#xD;
loaded and fired as rapidlyas possible, without&#xD;
waiting for any 'particular orders.. When Bat-'&#xD;
ler's army had somewhat recovered from the&#xD;
first effects of the surprise, the fire was'returned&#xD;
as random without much auceese, because their&#xD;
shots were sent after foes whom they could not&#xD;
see, and if one was wounded, it whs only by&#xD;
chance. Knowing by the nature 'of the attack,&#xD;
and the firing, that the assailants were but few&#xD;
in number, the colonel commanded a strong de-&#xD;
tachment of his rangers, to land sand force the&#xD;
audacious handful of .rebels from, theirposition;&#xD;
but by the.time the first, boas had touched the&#xD;
bank, the objects of their vengeance were re-&#xD;
treating.toward the valley, knowing that to re-&#xD;
sist such everwhel    ,as would: be.in vain,&#xD;
and result ina needless ateof life-&#xD;
Balled-in this.purpose, .ioly~remiaed, for&#xD;
the royalists to. smother- their: anger and. float&#xD;
down the stream as befbre-&#xD;
T ere was no lagging,'and every one did his&#xD;
best to reach thevalley before the enemy. Just&#xD;
&#xD;
as the sun was rising they came in sight ofl&#xD;
Wintermoot's stockades Near it was a cabin in1&#xD;
which a fire was blazingupon the hearth. -Mon-&#xD;
tour rushed into the dwelling, seized a glowing&#xD;
brand,'and shouting to the others'to follow, ran&#xD;
toward the obnoxious fort and applied the burn-&#xD;
ing wood in several places. .Instantly the tim-&#xD;
bers ignited, the red flames leaped rapidly up&#xD;
the palisades, and the works were soon sheeted&#xD;
with liquid fire. Those who had garrisoned the&#xD;
stockade, fled at the approach of the whigs, and&#xD;
just in the border of the forest looked back and&#xD;
saw their stronghold crumbling to ashes.&#xD;
The flames darted up fiercely against the sky,&#xD;
casting an unnatural glare far down the valley&#xD;
and along the opposite side.&#xD;
" Many's the time I've-wanted to see such -a:&#xD;
sight a this," said Dunbar, as they moved on.&#xD;
"And now," said Lawson, speaking to Roland,&#xD;
" we must prepare for the great -trial of to-day."&#xD;
The returning patriots were met at Fort Forty&#xD;
by many anxious faces ; and many 'voices in.&#xD;
quired concerning the night's adventures, which&#xD;
had been heard but the day before s ,r'ng the&#xD;
idea of danger. The alarms which hldso often&#xD;
been sontaded were at that juncture fully realized,&#xD;
and the most incredulous and deceived among&#xD;
them could no longer doubt:&#xD;
;We shall not dwell minutely on the prepara-&#xD;
tions that were made to-repel the invaders. All&#xD;
capable-of bearing arms assembled at Fort Forty.-&#xD;
Fly' they could not, even had they been disposed&#xD;
to do-so, although to their credit ,e it written,&#xD;
there was no disposition to act such a craven&#xD;
part when the conviction that :the foe was at&#xD;
harid became general. The militia turned out,&#xD;
and under the command of Colonel Zebulon&#xD;
Butler (no relation of Colonel John), Lieutenant&#xD;
Colonel Durrance, Major Garratt, and Colonel&#xD;
Dennison, made ready to give battle to the&#xD;
royalists.&#xD;
As we have not mentioned the names of these&#xD;
officers before, or rerred to them as making&#xD;
efforts for the protection oftthe valley, it is in-'&#xD;
.cumbent oil us to remark that they had been&#xD;
absent on activeservice in the corntinental army,&#xD;
ani had returned, some the day previ6 s&#xD;
add others that very morning; hence the reason&#xD;
that those gallant men have note itispoken'of.&#xD;
On that eventful morning a council of war was&#xD;
Balled to decide upon what course of action the.&#xD;
exjgency required. Colonel-Zebulon 1lutler vas&#xD;

had been considerable discussion pro and con,&#xD;
the opinion of 1)unbar was asked.&#xD;
\" Whether we had better march out and give&#xD;
'ems battle, depends altogether upon circum-&#xD;
stances, as 'twere. If there's any reason to ex-&#xD;

I should say if would be better to shut ourselves&#xD;
up in the fort and wait. But it's probable that&#xD;
you are better acquainted with these -matters&#xD;
than I am. tinl tt we can take the tories by&#xD;
surprise; I don't think the chances of success are&#xD;
very great."&#xD;
"Those are my own views," replied Colonel&#xD;
Dorranee. "If 'we had the ability to surprise&#xD;
our wily foes, we might hope to win the day.'&#xD;
"I trusted that we might be able to do that,"&#xD;
returned Colonel Butler, "for they  do not anti"&#xD;
cipate an attack from us. They have encamped&#xD;
not far above the ruins of Wintermoot's stock-&#xD;
ade, as you know, and are regaling themselves,&#xD;
I dare say, on thebest beeves they can find."&#xD;
"Come, Mr. Montour, what do you think ? I&#xD;
should like to know the opinion of one of whoaI&#xD;
have heard so many flattering things during the&#xD;
two hours I have been at Fort Forty," said Ma-&#xD;
jor Garratt, turning to Roland.&#xD;
An ingenuous blush passed over the young&#xD;
man's face, for he observed that the eyes of all&#xD;
the officers were directed toward him. He&#xD;
quickly regained his self-control, and replied&#xD;
with befitting modesty :&#xD;
-" That' his opinion was probably: worth but&#xD;
little when compared with that of veteran officers&#xD;

cause they  had no disciplined troops to 'oppose&#xD;
the regular soldiery of the royal army. They&#xD;
could not display in the field over four hundred&#xD;
-men to do battle with a thousand strong. Again,&#xD;
their force, consisting, as it did; of old men and&#xD;
mere striplings, would-very probably be dismay-&#xD;
ed by the shouts and terrific arts of six hundred&#xD;
savages and their hideous war-paint-.-experienc-&#xD;
ed braves who could fight'skilfully behind bushes,&#xD;
stones and trees, and, creeping like serpents, or&#xD;
running like moose, outflank their untried&#xD;
militia."&#xD;
" Very sensibly spoken," exclaimed Colonel&#xD;
Dorrance..&#xD;
"It would be prudent, before making the at-&#xD;
tack, to send forward a small scouting party," re-&#xD;
turned Zebulon Butler.&#xD;

This was certainly a very reasonable sugges-&#xD;
tion, and Dunbar was selected as the person best&#xD;
fitted for this service. It was a duty he was&#xD;
well qualified to perform, and he proceeded very&#xD;
calmly to the discharge of the same. Passing&#xD;
the smouldering timbers of Fort Wintermoot,&#xD;
and advancing under cover as much as possible,&#xD;
he was soon able to get a, very good view of the&#xD;
tory camp. They were at dinner, and gave&#xD;
evidence of being in the best offpirits. In sur-&#xD;
veying the motley groups engaged in that agree-&#xD;
able occupation, his 'eyes rested on Lanaway,&#xD;
Wintermoot and Martin Secord. The spectacle&#xD;
made his blood tingle with indignation, and cast-&#xD;
ing a wistful look at his rifle, he regretted that he&#xD;
could not use it in a manner which justice de-&#xD;
manded. - Nor were the individuals whom we&#xD;
have named the only ones whom, the scout re-&#xD;
eognized. He saw many who had once professed&#xD;
to be whigs, and who had freely expressed their&#xD;
hypocritical opinions when the patriots were&#xD;
consulting each other for the mutual good, and&#xD;
given advice which hadserved, as he could now&#xD;
see, to increase the apathetic indifference of the&#xD;
lessshrewd.&#xD;
" Heartless men !" mused Dunbar. "How&#xD;
can they rejoice and be merry at the thought of&#xD;
so much suffering as their wicked treachery will&#xD;
produce ?"&#xD;
Wintermoot'was talking earnestly with his-&#xD;
companions, and the scout felt a strong desire&#xD;
to get near enough to hear the conversation.&#xD;
Fortunately for him, the Senecas (whb were&#xD;
under the command of Gien-qwa-tah) were en-&#xD;
camped 'beyond the tories, between them and&#xD;
the woods, and this circumstance lessened the&#xD;
chances of discovery; because the ears .of an&#xD;
Indian are more ready to hear the light move-&#xD;
meats of an enemy, and their eyes quicker to&#xD;
detect the presence-of an unwelcome lurker.&#xD;
Dunbar crept nearer and still nearer, until the&#xD;
voices of the royalists were audible. He fancied&#xD;
he heard the name of Hester Hammond uttered&#xD;
in a contemptuous tone, and that increased his&#xD;
desire to hear more. Slowly he advanced. Lana-&#xD;
way was speaking, and the following words,&#xD;
greeted his ears, which were obviously in reply&#xD;
to some remark made by another party.&#xD;
"If it hadn't been for the black fellow, we&#xD;
should have done very well."&#xD;
"Our success would have been certain," re-&#xD;
sponded Martin, 'helping himself plentifully to.&#xD;
the eatables.&#xD;

caped death as if by miracle. Experienced-war-  "Jealous of such a dolt !" he exclaimed, after&#xD;
riors have been on their trail-they have been a pause."Hes  Hammond cares little for the&#xD;
dogged night and day, and fired at by marks- like of him."&#xD;
men considered skilful ; but, as you are aware,  "That's the only true thing you've spoken&#xD;
the two obnoxious persons are still in existence," this long time," thought Dunbar, whose ehimto&#xD;
said Lanaway.                              moethat heo d ot   ite an inst der allnimt&#xD;
" I have surmised, Lanaway, that you had, imagine that he had excited a teiuder sentiment&#xD;
possibly, some uncomfortable feelings of jealousy in the heart of the fair Quakeress.&#xD;
in connection with Roland Montour ?" added Some conversation then ensued relating moey&#xD;
interonneto with aRovert smile.u . especiallytothe respective maidens for whomithey&#xD;

Dunbar."                                   Ellen Devro and Elvira Hudson were the last&#xD;
An angry scowl contracted the forehead of words that the winds wafted after him as he crept&#xD;
the tory, and he muttered some kind of an im- away.&#xD;
precation which the scout could not hear.&#xD;

" The darkey struck uncommonly hard !"&#xD;
t added the other.&#xD;
" There is one thing'will tend to console you,"&#xD;
said Wintermoot, with a laugh. " You suffered&#xD;
for the sake of beauty; although without in-&#xD;
creasing your own personal good looks."&#xD;
" To be sure I have got a black eye, but time&#xD;
will cure that evil," Lanaway replied.&#xD;
"And I," resumed Martin, "have not only a&#xD;
black-and-blue eye, but a bruised and discolored&#xD;
ear ; and while we are speaking of the subject,&#xD;
I will remark that I was once kicked by a young&#xD;
colt, and knocked into a heap (metaphorically) ;&#xD;
but that was' a mere trifle to the blow that the&#xD;
nigger dealt me yesterday. But I've chalked it&#xD;
down, boys, against him, and hope to square' the&#xD;
account before the day closes."&#xD;
. "I also," said Wintermoot, moodily,, "have&#xD;
an account to adjust with a certain person, which&#xD;
I trust will be duly cancelled."&#xD;
"How cancelled ?" inquired Martin, with a&#xD;
sinister smile.&#xD;
" With blood !" rejoined Wintermoot, Rercely,&#xD;
"And who may that man be ?"&#xD;
" David Dunbar."&#xD;
"The scout of'the Susquehanna I" exclaimed&#xD;
Martin, with a start.&#xD;
" The same."&#xD;
"And right well I. know him ; I have also a&#xD;
'spore set down to his debt which must be looked&#xD;
to sooner or later," added Martin.&#xD;
"There are one or two others of the same ilk,&#xD;
who have done.us much harm," Lanaway ob-&#xD;
served, with an unseemly oath.&#xD;
"Name them ; though there Is small need of&#xD;
it, f'or I presume we all know who you mean,"&#xD;
Wintermoot responded.&#xD;
"Montour, and a stranger, who hovers about&#xD;
the valley, appearing at different times and&#xD;
places, and has frequently been seen with the&#xD;
young fAllow I have mentioned," said Lanaway&#xD;
"I have learned his name ; he is called Law&#xD;
son," .resumed Wintermoot.&#xD;
"I heard the Seneca chief talking of him to&#xD;
day; he has learned that it was through Law&#xD;
son's agency that Montour made his escape&#xD;
after he'was captured by him," continued Martin.&#xD;
"Then he marred a plan welllaid. It was&#xD;
Colonel Butler's intention that both Montour&#xD;
-and Dunbar should be put out of the way, for&#xD;
they were, figuratively speaking, the eyes of the&#xD;
valley, and nothing could be done without their&#xD;
getting knowledge of it. Often have they en-&#xD;

That Ellen Devron thought of her father was  "Yes, but methinks there is an awful stillness&#xD;
very nathral; nor may it be deemed unmaidenly in the air."&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, Ellen, here comes a, gentle little zephyr I&#xD;
to  stir your ringlets." *t&#xD;
" But I mean that there is something terribly&#xD;
oppressive in the' atmosphere, despite -all its.&#xD;

Elvira shuddered and again threw anxious&#xD;
glances up the river."s&#xD;
" Do you hear, aught, my children?" asked &#xD;
Mrs. Hudson, coming to the door.&#xD;
"Not a sound to indicate that the battle has&#xD;
commenced," replied Elvira.               .&#xD;
"Put up prayers, to the God of armies, chil-&#xD;
dren," added Mrs. Hudson, in a voice low and&#xD;
tremulous.&#xD;
The good lady had scarcely ceased speaking,&#xD;
when the roll and rattle and roar of musketry,&#xD;
in rapid and continuous volleys, reached their ex-&#xD;
pectant ears.&#xD;
" The dreadful work has begun I" exclaimed&#xD;
Mrs. Hudson; " Husbands and fathers, brothers&#xD;
and lovers are now being swept away by the&#xD;
demon of war. Heaven only knows how many&#xD;
that-are dear to us are being prostrated by those&#xD;
fearful volleys I"&#xD;
Soon a dense volume of smoke arose, and&#xD;
gradually expanding, hung over the valley like&#xD;
a thunder-cloud of three-fold blackness. The&#xD;
air, recently so odorous with the breath of flow-&#xD;
ers, became impregnated with sulphurous fumes.&#xD;
With claspedl hands and parted lips, the maidens&#xD;
continued to strain their eyes toward the scene,&#xD;
of tumult, and listen to the heavy volleys that&#xD;
were sending hundreds of souls to the world&#xD;
eternal.&#xD;
S" It seems to me," said Ellen, " that the firing&#xD;
grows more distinct."&#xD;
'" Then they must be retreating," returned&#xD;
Elvira.&#xD;
.Ellen did not ask who were retreating, for she&#xD;
knew if their friends were the victors, the battle&#xD;
would roll from them and up the valley toward&#xD;
Lackawannock.                           -&#xD;
Now we will approach the scene of conflict,&#xD;
note the disposition of the Americans and the'&#xD;
conduct of our hero. When the hastily raised&#xD;
and ill armed army reached the place where the&#xD;
battle was fought, they found the rangers and&#xD;
Indians drawn up in line, and ready to receive&#xD;
them. The command of the left was entrusted&#xD;

right was led by Colonel Zebulon Butler in per-&#xD;
son, aided by Major Garratt. Opposed to the&#xD;
latter, were the Rangers and Greens, command-&#xD;
ed by Colonel John Butler. The enemy's right&#xD;
was led by Gi-en-gwa-tah, and consisted mostly&#xD;
of Senecas.&#xD;
The Delaware chief and his warriors were on&#xD;
the left, and Montour was also in that division&#xD;
of the army. When the action commenced&#xD;
Roland looked for Lawson; but he was not to be&#xD;
seen ; in a few minutes after he saw him ap-&#xD;
proaching through the thickest of the fight, where&#xD;
the bullets were flying like hailstones.&#xD;
" The scout is a prisoner," he said, advancing&#xD;
to our hero's side. The words fell heavily on&#xD;
Montour's heart.&#xD;
"By whom was he taken ?" he asked.&#xD;
" By the Seneca chief, who is fighting like a&#xD;
fiend yonder, and whose war-cry rises loudly&#xD;
above all others on the field."&#xD;
"Then there is hope for him," returned&#xD;
Roland.&#xD;
"A forlorn one, at best."&#xD;
"He must be rescued," added Montour, wip-&#xD;
ing the smoke and powder from his face.&#xD;
"That is more easily said than done," said&#xD;
Lawson, dily.,&#xD;
"But I shall try it, nevertheless, though it&#xD;
cost me the best blood in my body. I cannot&#xD;
rest while my friend lies bound like a dog, await-&#xD;
ing the pains of a direful death. You are a&#xD;
brave man, sir-may I not rely on your aid?"&#xD;
" Consult yonder Delaware, and I will abide&#xD;
by the result; I place much reliance upon his&#xD;
judgment," Lawson-answered.&#xD;
"Have you been long acquainted with him ?"&#xD;
asked Roland, with 0 strong feeling of curiosity.&#xD;
"I knew him when he was but a child, but&#xD;
that was long ago." Montour looked earnestly&#xD;
at Lawson, and then advanced toward the spot&#xD;
where he heard the shout of tbi Lenni Lenape.&#xD;
He saw men and youth falling on every side of&#xD;
him, and the ranks of the Americans momenta-&#xD;
rily growing thinner. He spoke words of cheer&#xD;
as he passed along, and encouraged them with&#xD;
hopes which he was far from feeling. On alittle&#xD;
grAssy knoll he saw the body of a boy with&#xD;
bright flaxen hair, lying beside the mutilated&#xD;
corpse of an old man, whose head was white as&#xD;
the snows of winter.&#xD;

at length found Devron sitting by a heap of the&#xD;
dead, calmly awaiting his fate-the coup de grace&#xD;
and the scalping knife. Nor would he have been&#xD;
kept long in dread of the catastrophe, for a war-&#xD;
rior was even then advancing with a frightful&#xD;
cry to give him the death-stroke. Montour met&#xD;
the Seneca with a strong bound, and grasping&#xD;
the wrist that swung the uplifted tomahawk,&#xD;
buried his hunting knife in his bosom. The yell&#xD;
of triumph subsided to a hollow groan, and an&#xD;
ominous rattle in'the throat.&#xD;
"Done, right bravely!" exclaimed Devron.&#xD;
"Now fly for your life ! Give my love to Ellen,&#xD;
God bless her 1" Roland made no answer, but&#xD;
caught the wounded man in his arms.&#xD;
"Dar'll be trubbil dar !" cried some one whose&#xD;
voice it was not difficult to know. Montopr&#xD;
glanced toward a clump of bushes on his right&#xD;
and saw Cato contending with Wintermoot and&#xD;
two of the natives.. While he was considering&#xD;
what to do, he perceived Lawson running to the&#xD;
scene.&#xD;
" Good heavens, my dear Roland! you are&#xD;
extremely rash !" he heard him exclaim.&#xD;
" Hasten to aid Cato," replied Montour, and&#xD;
then hurried forward with his burden.&#xD;
"Leave me, gallant young man ! This-will&#xD;
cost you your life !" remonstrated Devron, un-&#xD;
willing to involve another in the doom, which,&#xD;
to him, appeared inevitable. The retreat had&#xD;
now become a flight. Vainly did Colonel Zebu-&#xD;
Ion Butler try to rally his men. He rode back&#xD;
and forth over the field, his gray hairs stream-&#xD;
ing in the wind, commanding and entreating by&#xD;
turns.&#xD;
"Do not leave me, my children ! Maintain&#xD;
your ground, and!the victory will be oirs i"&#xD;
But the voice of the veteran was unable to stay&#xD;
the, tide of retreat, and restore the fortunes of the&#xD;
day. A steady blaze'of fire followed his course&#xD;
over tive plains, while he strove to produce Qrder&#xD;
and obedience. The curtain of night fell deeper&#xD;
and darker, and gloomily the smoke of battle&#xD;
mingled with the shades of twilight. Then com-&#xD;
menced the horrors of retreat. Order was gone,&#xD;
and the Americans presented no serried line to&#xD;
oppose the exultant foe. Wild, disorderly and&#xD;
fatal was the flight of the miserable debris of the&#xD;
army. Demons mad shrieked after them, and&#xD;
direful deeds were done on the fair meadows of&#xD;
Wyoming..,,*i&#xD;
As Montour went on with his wounded friend,&#xD;
he came to a. spot where a- determined handful&#xD;
still made a desperate stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Our men are retreating-sisll we follow ?"&#xD;
he heard one ask.&#xD;
" I'll have one shot more," replied the person&#xD;
addressed, while at the same moment a ball&#xD;
struck a tree close. by his head, and a native&#xD;
sprang toward him with a spear. The whole-&#xD;
souled fellow, who would have "one shot more,"&#xD;
had the privilege, and the savage leaped high in&#xD;
the air and fell with his weapon clutched con-&#xD;
vulsively in his hand.&#xD;
"Now come," added his friend, but with un-&#xD;
parralleled calmness he answered, "I'll load&#xD;
first."*&#xD;
" What is that man's name ?" asked Montour,&#xD;
struck with admiration at his conduct.&#xD;
" George Cooper," replied Mr. Devron.&#xD;
"It should be remembered," returned Roland,&#xD;
with enthusiasm.&#xD;
If the reader will take the trouble to consult&#xD;
the pages of Stone's or Miner's History of Wyo-&#xD;
ming, he will, much to this satisfaction, learn,&#xD;
that such acts of boldness are not speedily for-&#xD;
gotten by a grateful people.  Long will the&#xD;
memory of Butler, Dorrance, Hewitt, Garratt,&#xD;
and a score of others, be cherished by the lovers&#xD;
of liberty.&#xD;
"But these are deeds which should not pass away,&#xD;
And names thamustnot wither, though the earth&#xD;
Forgets her empires with a just decay,&#xD;
The enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;&#xD;
The high the mountain-majesty of worth&#xD;
Should be, and shall, survivor of its woe,&#xD;
And from tts immortality look forth&#xD;
In the sun's face, like yonderAljiine snow,&#xD;
Imperishably pure beyond all things below."&#xD;
Captain Hewitt,'whose fate is well known to&#xD;
those versed in the history of those fearful times,&#xD;
was at that crisis striving to make the drummer&#xD;
" strike up ;" but his drum was literally riddled&#xD;
with balls, and a tin-pan would have been quite&#xD;
as good for his purpose. .&#xD;
" Shall we retreat V' asked one of his lieuten-&#xD;
ants. " We are left alone."&#xD;
" I'll be shot if I do !" retorted the captain,&#xD;
resolutely.&#xD;
He did not stir and was "shot" where he&#xD;
was. The next day his body was found mutila-&#xD;
ted and scalped.&#xD;
Here indeed was a rare exhibition of courage ;&#xD;
and Montour as he pushed forward with Devron,&#xD;
prayed fervently that the captain might be spared&#xD;
to his country many years; but when he looked&#xD;
back, after going a few rods, he was no longer&#xD;
to be seen-he was stretched beside other noble&#xD;
hearts that had ceased to beat.&#xD;

&#xD;
ering his face with his hands, " Alas, my poor&#xD;
girl!"&#xD;
"She is not forgotten, Mr. Devron, I assure&#xD;
you she is not. I solemnly promise that I will&#xD;
save her, if it be in the power of mortal man to&#xD;
do so."&#xD;
" I thank you from my soul ! But time is&#xD;
flying--the tide of death is setting that way,"&#xD;
replied Devron.&#xD;
"I know that the tide of destruction is sweep-&#xD;
ing downward,. but it will be long in reaching&#xD;
Mr. Hudson's dwelling. Our ruthless victors&#xD;
have enough work on their hands o keep them&#xD;
busy for some hours. Avery trembling fugitive&#xD;
will be hunted up-the fighting men wjll fall&#xD;
first, afterwards the more tender and helpless&#xD;
ones will suffer. 13y midnight the valley will&#xD;
stibam with fire. Adieu, Mr. Devron, for the&#xD;
present. I trust to see you again before the&#xD;
morning.''&#xD;
Cato pushed the boat from the bank while the&#xD;
wounded man was expressing his gratitude to&#xD;
Roland. This matter being dismissed, Montour&#xD;
prepared to turn his attention once more to the&#xD;
consideration of the means of liberating Dunbar&#xD;
from his perilous captivity.&#xD;
"Most of the. Senecas are now eager in the&#xD;
pursuit, and probably but few warriors are left&#xD;
to guard the scout," said Lawson.&#xD;
"I have thought of that, and am encouraged&#xD;
by the circumstance," Montour rejoined.&#xD;
"My warriors are ready," said Castanego_&#xD;
"Let us to the camp of the Meng'we. Their&#xD;
fireslurn dimly yonder, for their nostrils ac~e&#xD;
fell ofmthe scent of blood. But many of their&#xD;
braves have fallen; the eyes of my warriors have&#xD;
been upon them, and some of ,their strong men&#xD;
have perished."&#xD;
*"My ears hear doleful cries," he added, as&#xD;
the wind bore mournful wailings up the river.&#xD;
The Good Spirit is angry with my white broth-&#xD;
era. On! on ! son of t e Delaware,ftliat the&#xD;
lightnings of the eagle eye and the fires of the&#xD;
strong heart be, not extinguished." .&#xD;
" I am young, and my feet have not so often&#xD;
trodden the dangerous war-path, nor have I&#xD;
looked so often into the camp of the Mengwe as,&#xD;
the chief of the Lenni Lenapes ; therefore let&#xD;
my red brother take the lead, because his heart.&#xD;
is big and he knows the ways of the enemies of&#xD;
the Delawa, replied Montour.&#xD;
"My cousin.has'a smooth tongue; and-speaks&#xD;
flatteringly to the unlearned Lenape; but the&#xD;
Lenape knows that he undervalues- his: own&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE ROYAL GR1i ENS&#xD;
&#xD;
powers and speaks lightly Of hit skill. The red&#xD;
man has seen him follow the frail, and strikes&#xD;
an enemy, and he knows his step is stealthy&#xD;
and fleet, and his arm swift to avenge a wrong l&#xD;
let him lead on, and Castanego will follow."&#xD;
"The words of the Delaware chief do my&#xD;
heart good; they sound pleasantly in my ears,&#xD;
and I will do as he bids me, because it is his&#xD;
pleasure, and not because I am so skilful as he,'&#xD;
returned Montour.&#xD;
While these words were being exchanged the&#xD;
parties were not, standing still, but moving to-&#xD;
ward the Iroquois camp with much circumspect&#xD;
tion. In approaching the spot, they passed over&#xD;
t. considerable portion of the field of battle, and&#xD;
saw many mournful mementoes of the fight. As&#xD;
they warily drew near the ground where the In-&#xD;
dians had made their bivouac, the aspect of&#xD;
things was greatly changed. The hundreds of,&#xD;
red faces that had swarmed there during the day&#xD;
could no longer be seen-they were out on a mis-&#xD;
sion of death. Montour queried whether all had&#xD;
not gone, and was about to express his convic-&#xD;
tion that such was the case, when the Delaware&#xD;
pointed towardscacabin standing solitary upon&#xD;
the plains. A closer scrutiny revealed the forms&#xD;
of men. Lawson suggested that they Were a&#xD;
party left to guard the scout, who was doubtless&#xD;
in the cabin. To etect their laudable purpose,&#xD;
it was necessary to overpower these grim and&#xD;
watchful sentinels. To approach them in andi-&#xD;
rect line, would have been injudicious, and in&#xD;
fact impracticable; therefore theyadvanced in a&#xD;
circuitous manner. When they had gained- that&#xD;
side of the cabin farthest from the battle-field,&#xD;
they discovered that the few .Senecas who re-&#xD;
mained behind were quite forgetful of their-trust.&#xD;
The dwelling was no longer surrounded as it&#xD;
had been, for in their eagerness to know what&#xD;
was passing down the valley, they had forsaken&#xD;
their several posts and gathered at that point&#xD;
nearest the scene of conflict, where, with dis'&#xD;
tended nostrils, and glowing eyes which shone&#xD;
through the darkness like fire, they listened to&#xD;
every sound that was borne to their ears, longing&#xD;
to join in the dreadful din, yet fearing to desert&#xD;
entirely the duty that had been assigned-them:&#xD;
With their feathered heads:bent forward, their&#xD;
bodies fixed and statue-like, their tomahawks&#xD;
clutched in their firmly het fingers, they present-&#xD;
ed a wild and striking tableaux. Their-souls&#xD;
were with their-brethren,slaying, scalping, shout-&#xD;
ing the cries of, their nation. Thus intensely&#xD;
silent they sent their savage thoughts after those&#xD;
&#xD;
who were shedding innocent blood, and rioting&#xD;
with untold fury in scenes of horror which no&#xD;
Imagination can paint.&#xD;
That was their last battle, real or. imaginary.&#xD;
The hatchets which they grasped in their ner-&#xD;
vous, restless hands were never fleshed again in&#xD;
hnman mortality--their lithe arms never grap-&#xD;
pled a foe, and never more did theyeraise the&#xD;
war-cry of the Iroquois. They perished where&#xD;
they stood-fell suddenly while their spirits yet&#xD;
+    revelled with the distant strife-sank upon the&#xD;
turf before they knew danger was near, and died&#xD;
before a single whoop-or shout went up to speak&#xD;
their rage or agony.&#xD;
Montour and his party had crept upon them&#xD;
warily, and thus they fell. The cabin was en-&#xD;
tered, but Dunbar was not there. They searched&#xD;
every part of the dwelling, but their labor was&#xD;
fruitless-the scout could not be found.&#xD;
Ellen Devron and Elvira Hudson continued&#xD;
te gaze anxiously up the river. That the firing&#xD;
drew nearer, and was more scattering, there&#xD;
could no longer remain a doubt. This was a&#xD;
circumstance that boded little good, for it spoke&#xD;
to the hearts of the maidens of retreat; and re-&#xD;
treat was equivalent to slaughter, rapine and&#xD;
devastation. The day faded away, and the last&#xD;
rays of the setting sun seemed to struggle faintly&#xD;
with the dark smoke of battle, and to be finally&#xD;
quenched by its mephitic vapors..,A gloomy&#xD;
twilight followed, and then night was fairly in&#xD;
the ascendant. A few dropping, irregular shots&#xD;
were still heard, mingled with other sounds,&#xD;
shrill and ominous.&#xD;
"The sad truth is told," said Ellen. "Not a&#xD;
hope of victory now remains to us. Too well&#xD;
do those sounds admonish us that all is lost.&#xD;
Only a random firing is heard ;, the volleys that&#xD;
mark a regular engagement have long pince&#xD;
ceased, and our defenders'are retreating toward&#xD;
the forts. AlasI who can tell us where are&#xD;
those who went out from us not many hours&#xD;
ago-friends, relatives, mutual protectors of our&#xD;
sex."&#xD;
"Not many of them will return," replied El-&#xD;
vira. "And to that painful fact we must try to&#xD;
reconcile our minds."&#xD;
" We may well pause and ask what will be&#xD;
our own fate, children," said Mrs. Hudson.&#xD;
As if tobear unequivocal evidence to this re-&#xD;
mark, a fire shot up from the opposite shore&#xD;
from a dwelling just fired by a savage hand.&#xD;
The flames ate greedily in to the fabric, and by&#xD;
&#xD;
its light several fugitives werd plainly seen for a&#xD;
brief instant pursued by pitiless beings madly&#xD;
elated with victory. From this spectacle they&#xD;
were forced to turn to epntemplate another&#xD;
Wilkesbarre Fort, not far, above them on the&#xD;
same side of the ricer, was ere long in a blaze,&#xD;
and the parties who were unwilling beholders of&#xD;
a sight so terrifying, remembered that many fam-&#xD;
ilies had taken shelter there. Where were they ?&#xD;
Was the leaping fire their winding sheet'?- Was&#xD;
the little stockade their funeral pyre ? They&#xD;
could not answer these questions at first ; but&#xD;
presently they were partially solved, for the&#xD;
glare of the burning fortification revealed the&#xD;
figures of women and children flying to the ad-&#xD;
.jacent swamp,&#xD;
Stone, in his "RHistory+ of Wyoming," elo&#xD;
quently describes the fearful event, and we can.&#xD;
not do better than make a brief quotation from&#xD;
his work.        .&#xD;
"Theclosing scete of that memorable drama&#xD;
was in terrible keeping with the bloody acts&#xD;
which, had preceded. Flushed with victory;&#xD;
the savage Senecas still pursued their vi}ms,&#xD;
filling the valley with their wild screams, and&#xD;
rushing onward in overwhelming numbers. The&#xD;
few Americans who escaped the murderous con'&#xD;
fiidt in the field, fled precipitately to Wilkes-&#xD;
barre Fort, where were gathered women and&#xD;
children, waiting the dread issue of the contest'&#xD;
with breathless anxiety. Their return only add-&#xD;
ed to the dreadful consternation already pre-&#xD;
vailing in the fortress. Seized with panic at the&#xD;
idea of being coopedup there with the certainty&#xD;
of meeting a ruthless destruction if they remain-&#xD;
ed, they fled to the mountains, and sought refuge&#xD;
'a the recesses of a dreary swamp, called after-,&#xD;
ward from   the numbers who fell there,' the&#xD;
"Shades of Death." But an enemy was on&#xD;
their track, familiar with swamps, and expert' in&#xD;
threading the deepest fastnesses.  They were&#xD;
soon found, when the work of destruction re-.&#xD;
commenced with a fiercer violence. To the few.&#xD;
survivors this was 'a night long to be remema,&#xD;
bered' Behind them theysaw the flames spread-&#xD;
ing destruction through the valley. O one side&#xD;
of them was the battlefield, on which 'lay their&#xD;
brave brethren weltering in their blood. Around&#xD;
them, the agonizing shri&amp;amp; proclaimed that the&#xD;
dreadful carnage was still going on."&#xD;
Ellen and her friends looked at each other in&#xD;
speechless terror. Those whom they expected&#xD;
came not to relieve their dreadful anxiety, oT to&#xD;
guard them from the peril fast drawing upon&#xD;

them, with the sure portents of sweeping them&#xD;
away. They beheld the distance between them&#xD;
and their foes momentarily growing less, and to&#xD;
add to flie horrors of their situation, a fugitive&#xD;
passed near the cabin in full flight, pursued by&#xD;
an enemy, who already exulted in the certainty&#xD;
of success.&#xD;
"It is time to go," said Mrs. Hudson.&#xD;
" Where ?" asked Elvira.&#xD;
" To the woods," was the hurried response.&#xD;
" Hear you not yonder whoops and shrieks,&#xD;
and do you not foresee what our own fate may&#xD;
be there ?" replied Elvira.&#xD;
"We will not fly in that direction; I know of&#xD;
a more secure retreat," added Mrs. Hudson,&#xD;
who, good woman, was resolved to encourage,&#xD;
the maidens as much.as lay in her power, and&#xD;
make them feel, if possible, a hope which was at&#xD;
that crisis a stranger to her own breast--that of&#xD;
final escape. She entered the dwelling and&#xD;
brought thence a small basket of food which she&#xD;
well knew would be wanted' in the wilderness to&#xD;
which she contemplated going.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Ought we not to tarry a short time longer ?"&#xD;
asked Ellen, still lingering.&#xD;
" And for what object ! Let me warn you,&#xD;
child, not to expect too confidently the return-&#xD;
the return of our friend," resumed Mrs. Hudson.&#xD;
"It is impossible for me to abandon the&#xD;
thought that my father will soon appear," added&#xD;
Ellen. *&#xD;
"I know it's hard, but many have parted this&#xD;
day to meet no more in time," returned Mrs.&#xD;
Hudson. " We have lingered too long already.&#xD;
Hush ! did you that ? Some one comes this&#xD;
way-come, girls, come !"&#xD;
They turned from the cabin toward the forest&#xD;
in the rear; but had proceeded but a few yards&#xD;
when - they heard voices behind them. There&#xD;
were several fruit trees at hand, overhung with&#xD;
the green vines of the creeping grape, and amid&#xD;
the verdant foliage, the fair fugitives took tem-&#xD;
porary shelter.&#xD;

Muchjmore than I have been willing to own)&#xD;
have my thoughts been directed toward Ellen&#xD;
Devron. Indeed, friend Martin, I feel that it is&#xD;
quite impossible for me to be happy without&#xD;
her," Laid Lanaway, with much emphasis.&#xD;
"Thus is it with me ; Elvira Hudson has en-&#xD;
grossed all the love I am capable of feeling. I&#xD;
may say that I have set my heart fully upon the&#xD;
self-willed damsel. I had hoped (and have in&#xD;
truth acted with reference to that matter) that&#xD;
the events of this day would give mepower over,&#xD;
the person of the girl; but like you I am deeply&#xD;
disappointed. " Our royalist friends are victors,&#xD;
and the rebels are dying by scores, but I con-&#xD;
fes that I am miserable."&#xD;
Ren wished that she could safely assure him&#xD;
that guilt is ever wretched.&#xD;
" Turn your gaze yonder I What do you see ?&#xD;
Wilkesbarre Fort in flames. What do your ears&#xD;
hear?  The exultant cries of merciless savages;&#xD;
mingled with the agonizing shrieks of vanquished&#xD;
foes ? But does this content you ? Are you&#xD;
happy in the contemplation of these direful&#xD;
sights and sounds ? Far fruit ; you experience&#xD;
as I do, the unwelcome pangs of baffled hopes&#xD;
and disappointed love. What then avails this&#xD;
awful scene ?  To us nothing-to the followers&#xD;
of John Butler much. And why is this scene&#xD;
comparatively fruitless to us? For the reason&#xD;
that those upon whom we have set our. hearts&#xD;
have eluded uts."-&#xD;
"You speak to the point, and I acknowledge&#xD;
that really we have -gained but little, except the&#xD;
punishment of our=enemies.. Dunbar the scout&#xD;
is a prisoner-Gaston is wounded, and doubt-&#xD;
less Devron,, Montour, Hudson, and the Ham-&#xD;
monds will fall. I dare say before this moment&#xD;
they have-lost their scalps. More than this I&#xD;
confess we have not gained, for those who ar-&#xD;
'vive'this trying ordeal, will forever after hold our&#xD;
name in detestation," answered  artin.&#xD;
"True indeed is your last remark,"- thought&#xD;
Ellen.&#xD;
"We shall be called monsters and traitors, no&#xD;
doubt ; but to indemnify ourselves as much as&#xD;
possible for what we shall safer in the future,,&#xD;
leta u make sure of those fair.but perverse ones,&#xD;
who refused to listenuto'refaon, and preferred&#xD;

" Ill will it fare with them if they are. There&#xD;
are those in pursuit of such, who are keen at fol-&#xD;
lowing a flying enemy, and who will not relent&#xD;
at the contemplation of a pretty maiden, or spare&#xD;
a woman on account of her sex."&#xD;
" Heavens I" exclaimed Lanaway. "I shud-&#xD;
der at the thought of the danger that hangs over&#xD;
the lead of Ellen Devron ; and yet, Martin, I-&#xD;
warned her of it-and-and she scorned me for&#xD;
my pains. I told her that fire would pass over&#xD;
Wyoming, in awful furyg and that. the toma-&#xD;
hawk would do a work of blood ; but indignant,&#xD;
she covered me with reproach."&#xD;
"Whatever betide them, we know for our sat-&#xD;
isfaction that they were warned, and might have&#xD;
been shielded from the devastating storm."&#xD;
"And, methinks, Martin, that we wooed in a&#xD;
novel way ; I doubt whether woman can be won,&#xD;
by threats. When I held before the bright- eyes&#xD;
of Ellen; a picture of woe like the scene now&#xD;
transpiring around us, I was lower in her esti-&#xD;
mation than ever before-immeasurably lower,"&#xD;
added Lanaway, bitterly. '&#xD;
"Flattery has ever proved more effectual&#xD;
than threats, from mother Eve downward to&#xD;
this day. Speak to them smoothly-praise them-&#xD;
for their beauty, and they will smile upon -you ;&#xD;
but approach them'with blunt speech and home-&#xD;
ly truth, and your room will be more desirable&#xD;
than your company."&#xD;
"Let us go ashbrt distance in this direction,"&#xD;
added Lanaway.&#xD;
The two royalists, who had been looking.about&#xD;
them with eagerness while thus conversing, now&#xD;
drew nearer the spot where the females were con-&#xD;
cealed,. who, stood, stupified with terror, scarcely&#xD;
daring to breathe. Martin meanwhile passed&#xD;
round tlie-trees,, within a few yards of the trem-&#xD;
bling ones, and putting aside the branches at-&#xD;
tempted to look beneath the vines ; but it was so&#xD;
dark that he saw not the forms of the fugitives.&#xD;
There followed, so far as the latter were con-&#xD;
cerned, a motment-of intense suspense ; then Se-&#xD;
cdrd walked from the -spot ; examining every&#xD;
place within bow-shot where he deemed it possi-&#xD;
ble for a human being to be secreted.&#xD;
Lanaway employed himself in a sinillariaan-&#xD;
ner. Havinagtaken-' an opposite direction, he&#xD;
suddenly stopped and bent his steps directly to-&#xD;
ward the fruit' trees.  That the ' fact of their&#xD;
propinquity would tow ;be -known, seemed ar&#xD;

THE ROYE&#xD;
ery, some lucky chance seemed to prevent the&#xD;
catastrophe.&#xD;
Other incidents now attracted the attention of&#xD;
Lanaway and his companion. Several panting&#xD;
victims closely pursued by the triumphant sav-&#xD;
ages and tories, ran past the spot, hoping to&#xD;
escape the vindictive fury of foes drunken with&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
"We are baffled oncemore," remarked Lana-&#xD;
way; "but perhaps it isn't too late to deal with&#xD;
those who have stood most in our way."&#xD;
"Let us go down to the river; we may find&#xD;
Gaston, Hudson, Montour, De~vron or somebody&#xD;
else there," Martin rejoined, and they instantly&#xD;
hurried away.&#xD;
"Thank kind Heaven, my children, for .you&#xD;

wicked men.- Come, we must go on."&#xD;
"Speak softly, mother !I- look  toward the&#xD;
house I" answered Elvira.&#xD;
" The savages have discovered it, and are&#xD;
searching within for its recent occupants," ob-&#xD;
served Ellen.&#xD;
" What a yell of disappointment! they dis-&#xD;
cern that the inmates have gone. What if they&#xD;
should come this way and look for us-the dis.&#xD;
tance is so short that I tremble ?" added Elvira.&#xD;
One of the natives , appeared with a blazing&#xD;
brand, and proceeded to fire the dwelling in sev-&#xD;
eral places.&#xD;
" So many happy hours have passed there,&#xD;
and now to see it swept away!" sighed Elvira.&#xD;
"Think of those who lose more thanhouses&#xD;
or lands-life itself," said her mother.&#xD;
The fire quickly performed its work upon the&#xD;
cabin; in ten minutes it was wrapped in flame.&#xD;
Occasionally a puff of wind carried the smoke&#xD;
and cinders toward them, rendering their posi-&#xD;
tion almost intolerable.&#xD;
Around the flaming fabric infuriated beings ran,&#xD;
brandishing aloft the' tomahawk and the gun,&#xD;
entertaining, doubtless, a 'faint suspicion that{&#xD;
some unfortunate one might be hidden in the&#xD;
burning building, whowould rush out to escape&#xD;
a fiery death,: to meet a quicker fate; at their&#xD;
hands. The leaves of the trees nearest the&#xD;
dwelling grew sere and yellow, scorched by the&#xD;
intensity of the heat. The fugitives bgan to&#xD;
suffer from the increased temperature, 'anid ex-&#xD;
pected to be drive i from their covert by aehot,&#xD;
and suffocating gushes of blinding smo that&#xD;
repeatedly poured upon them. Prone uon the&#xD;
earth, with their handkerchiefs pressed' closely&#xD;
to their faces, they awaited in dread expectation,&#xD;

AL GREENS.                                 87&#xD;
and with sufferings well nigh insupportable, the&#xD;
uncertain'issue. Added to the torture of the&#xD;
seething vapor that enshrouded them, was the&#xD;
no less agonizing fear of being discovered by&#xD;
the authors of those terrific scenes.&#xD;
Ellen felt a deadly stupor stealing upon her-&#xD;
a painful distension of the lungs-a dizzinessiin&#xD;
her brain-an awful sense of suffocation, which&#xD;
threatened a speedy extinction of life. Sensa-&#xD;
tion, memory, consciousness, grew less and less.&#xD;
Her mind teemed with feverish fancies and fan-&#xD;
tastic creations, as dreadful in their imaginary&#xD;
terrors as the drama, being enacted in the world&#xD;
of reality in which she dwelt.&#xD;
She still heard (within) the shouts ofenemies ;&#xD;
and burning dwellings and dying victims were&#xD;
pictured with life-like distinctness upon the field"&#xD;
of mental vision. Suddenly a sound recalled&#xD;
her from the dark trance that had bound her&#xD;
senses-a voice smote upon her ear with magical&#xD;
effect. She raised herself from the earth with a&#xD;
convulsive effort, and gazing wildly through the&#xD;
smoke and'fire, beheld Roland Montour being&#xD;
down the savages. She had a vague conscious-&#xD;
ness of being lifted in some person's arms and&#xD;
borne.swiftly away. And this circumstance was&#xD;
connected with a feeling of, security, strange,&#xD;
gladdening and soothing to bher perturbed soul.&#xD;
. The re-action was so great that she knew no&#xD;
more, and seemed to exist in a, dreamy, curious&#xD;
and shadowy realm, without pain, without rap-&#xD;
ture, without fear, and yet without;enjoyment.&#xD;
In that suspension of all the active phenomena&#xD;
of existence, Ellen was lost to time, circ imstance,&#xD;
place, the past and present-ceased to hay&#xD;
knowledge -of friends or foes, or the t&#xD;
enacting upon the plainsof Wyoming-one&#xD;
own delightful home, but now    the reflex f&#xD;
Pandemonium itself. Yet those friendly arms&#xD;
were about her, her head was pillowed tenderly&#xD;
on a bosom full of unspoken kindness, unuttered&#xD;
'friendship, untiring devotion, unknown love.&#xD;
"Flower ormy life, so lovely and so lone!&#xD;

he saw but small chance of effecting' a desig&#xD;

But a manlike Dunbar, who had seen so mue&#xD;
of danger and vicissitude, was not easily subdue&#xD;
inspirit and resolution. Many similarly placed&#xD;

the'battle. Every volley made him anxious t&#xD;
join inthe melee, and the shouting and cheering&#xD;
of the combatants chafed his temper and render&#xD;
ed him truly miserable under the restraint t&#xD;
which he was subjected. As the tumult of bat&#xD;
tle increased,- so in proportion grew his impa&#xD;
tience. Unable longerto endure the suspense&#xD;
he  ragged himself, by much exertion, to th(&#xD;

see what tlhe aspect of things might be. Un&#xD;
luckily the window looked from and not toward&#xD;
the seene of battle., He was.greatly surprised to&#xD;
discover that not a single Idian was to be seen&#xD;
on that side of the cabin; in their eagerness t&#xD;
behold the conflict, they had forgotten theirtrust,.&#xD;

Pale lbud pointed to the window; Dunbar ti&#xD;
looked in,  ae saw Wintermoot and twomen ; ut&#xD;
the fistrd standing over Hester, who had he&#xD;
swoned,   dasA s trying to estore her.0O&#xD;
"N   o areinfer" he exclainito: r dressing the m&#xD;

"Iwisi I had-weapons,"'said Dunbar.&#xD;
"Here they are,'' returned Pale Cloud, plac-&#xD;
ing a brace of pistols in his 'hands, The scout .&#xD;
eagerly caught the instruments,'and when Win-,&#xD;
termoot led the way into the open air (followed&#xD;
by the men bearing their insensible burden), he&#xD;
fired both the weapons in rapid succession.&#xD;
Wintermoot and one of his accomplices fell,&#xD;
while the other ran away as fast as possible.&#xD;
Dunbar took Hister in his arms, and bore her&#xD;
toward the forest.&#xD;
"I have been, up to 'Hudson's, but was too&#xD;
late," said Katherine, as she kept along at.his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"You learned nothing of them   as used to&#xD;
make the place so pleasant and cheerful like 1"&#xD;
asked the scout.&#xD;
" No ;' but owing you a debt of gratitude, I&#xD;
hastened to Mr. Hammond's, thinking I could&#xD;
best pay it by offering my services to the maiden&#xD;
whom you aire bearing to place of safety."&#xD;
"Yes, what little you may happen to fancy&#xD;
that you owe me on the score of freeing you&#xD;
front  the war-party of Mphawks, can well be&#xD;
settled in that way."&#xD;
"I have heard that you loved her; Roland&#xD;
has-&#xD;
"Hush! for heaven's sake--she revues!'" he&#xD;
exclaimed.&#xD;
"Do not feargo     Dunbar. What,,I.have&#xD;
aid is not so profound a secret as you may be&#xD;
inclined to imagine, or will it, perchance, prove&#xD;
o--"&#xD;
".Be quiet,. woman!1 Do you not see, that she&#xD;
s becoming conscious of what is said? and I&#xD;
wouldn't for the world have her hear sich absurd&#xD;
otions, as I may say'," added Dunbar, with con-&#xD;
iderable sharpness.&#xD;
Pale, Cloud directed her attention to Hester,&#xD;
ad she.was soon sufficiently restored to walk&#xD;
ith the aid of Dunbar's arm to support her ;&#xD;
or she dad passed through a scene of excite-&#xD;
tent so intense thpt it had nearly deprived her&#xD;
f physical power. Calmly and trustingly she&#xD;
signed herself to'the guidnce and protection&#xD;
f the scout, refraining from asking those ques-&#xD;
ons Foucerning her friends that struggled for&#xD;
teratce in her breast, fearing that she should&#xD;
ear news of deription to increase her trials.&#xD;
f the death of her brother, Dunbar made no&#xD;
ention, reserving that sad recital for a season&#xD;
hen she should be better able to bear her grief.&#xD;

Esther perform the work of that memorable&#xD;
.night: Passing -around the circle, chanting a&#xD;
wild, startling air, half, shriek, half howl, she&#xD;
dealt her-blows at measured periods. Every in-&#xD;
stant Hudson sawthe priestess of death approach-&#xD;
ing nearer to his friend Hammond, and he long-&#xD;
ed to do something to save him. He had'his&#xD;
loaded rifle in his hand, and no longer capable of&#xD;
restraining his indignation, horror andsympathy,&#xD;
he aimed at the female monster,, through an&#xD;
opening in the circle.&#xD;
Sharply cracked the weapon, and the crimson&#xD;
queen fell upon the body of her last terrible of-&#xD;
fering. The confusion created by this incident&#xD;
gave Hammond a chance to recover his feet,&#xD;
shake off the murderers and escape. Hudson&#xD;
fled and no pursuit was offered, for the savage&#xD;
actors were quite sated and satisfied with what&#xD;
they had already done.&#xD;
In crossing the river, far down below, he dis-&#xD;

Devron to a place of security.&#xD;

THE ROTA&#xD;
&#xD;
Our next and last scene Ope  at the subter-&#xD;
ranean vault in the mountaldi The sun came&#xD;
up as brightly as though no deeds of wicked-&#xD;
ness had been wrought in the valley of Wyo-&#xD;
ming. The winds were as soft and fragrant as if&#xD;
they had never borne the odor of, blood, or the&#xD;
cries of despair. The wild birds sang cheerily&#xD;
in the trees, and there was no sound of misery&#xD;
there. Roland Montour stood near the rift,'&#xD;
with Ellen leaning upon his arm. The maiden&#xD;
looked pale and languid, but not unhappy.. The&#xD;
young man placed his hand upon hers, some-&#xD;
what timidly, and said in a low tone :&#xD;
1' The few words- which I wished to address&#xD;
to you I will say at once, and I hope you will&#xD;
not reprove me too severely form temerity.&#xD;
It is true that a kreat calainity hdi befallen the&#xD;
valley-a calamity that oppresses all'hearts ; but&#xD;
I trust that you will not consider it "ill-tined,&#xD;
when I allude to the feelings which your beauty&#xD;
and amiability have'inspired."  .&#xD;
Ellen's face suddenly changed its pallor for a&#xD;
rich crimson hue.&#xD;
"It may with some plausibility be said, that&#xD;
my acquaintance with you is short, but methinks&#xD;
no measured period of time is required to win&#xD;
the human heart-to smite the rock of human&#xD;
affection and make its purest waters gush forth,&#xD;
I have smothered my passion long-I can re-&#xD;
strain myself no longer, and an compelled, by a&#xD;
sentiment that'I am certain will be as lasting as&#xD;
life itself, to make this bold and perhaps un-&#xD;
welcome declaration."      -&#xD;
Montour paused, and' Ellen averted her face&#xD;
in such a manner that he could not see its&#xD;
eXpression.&#xD;
" I am grateful that you hear me thus patient-&#xD;
ly and kindly. I ought to reflect that you know&#xD;
but littleof my history, and that the son of a-"&#xD;
"Ialf-breed," added a voice near at hand.&#xD;
RolInd looked to his right and saw Pale Cloud&#xD;
at hi fide.-&#xD;
"Behold my mother !" said Montour, as Kath-&#xD;
erine drew near and took Ellen's unresigting&#xD;
'hand. The maiden , gazed into, the woman's&#xD;
face a ugorient with' deep interest, and-replied:,&#xD;
"And do you believe, Roland Montour, tha ,I&#xD;
could think less of you for confessing'. thisfair&#xD;

"May I, dare I flatter my heart with the rai-&#xD;
turous thought that at some-future time, I may&#xD;
presume    ,to-la  some slight claim to the&#xD;
En'iA  sgr of Ellen Devron?"&#xD;
Thee.aiden sighed, inclined her head gently,&#xD;
and attemptedtto make some fitting reply, but&#xD;
could not.&#xD;
Roland construed her silence in a most favor-&#xD;
able light, and withwquickness which would have&#xD;
appeared. quite inagical to honest Dunbar, who,&#xD;
good soul, had no conception of such interest-&#xD;
ing matters, save what 'he had'learned upon the&#xD;
trail.&#xD;
While Montour was .making all tie natural&#xD;
efforts that he could command to express his un-&#xD;
expected felicity, Pale   Cloud uttered a piercing&#xD;
shriek and fell to the ground ; or more truth-&#xD;
fully would have fallen, had' iot Lawson sprang&#xD;
forward, from the shadow of thCeadjacent rock,&#xD;
and caughtiier in season to prevent that accident.&#xD;
Here was a new wonder for Roland, and lie&#xD;
looked at the, strange scene with unfeigned&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
"It's, what, I allers thought," said Dunbar,&#xD;
emerging from the  rift.  " It's Zinzendorf,&#xD;
himself!"-                            -&#xD;
" 'And who is Zinzendorf ?" asked Montour,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
f  Ican't reckon youamong the wise children,&#xD;
because you: don't know your ,own father, as&#xD;
'twere," replied the scout..&#xD;
Pale Cloud revived, and opening her, eyes,,was&#xD;
conscious that she sawno phantom figure.&#xD;
." Zinzendorf 1" she mirmurgd,.and seemed on&#xD;
the point of relapsing again- into insensibility ;&#xD;
but water which Ellen sprinkled;en, oher face&#xD;
restored her.&#xD;
f' This seems dream-like and unnatural !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Lawson. "I have mourned yon as dead&#xD;
or many years."&#xD;
"And i toe I not lept for you as long?" re-&#xD;
plie4 Katherinein trembling accents.&#xD;
"The report reached me that you had perish-&#xD;
ed  y the hand of the Mohawk who carried you&#xD;

Mu. HUDSON, whose name has not yet been&#xD;
particularly noticed in connection with the bat-&#xD;
tle, fought in the right wing and was among the&#xD;
last to leave the field. Being hotly pursued, he&#xD;
diverged from the general course of the fugitives,&#xD;
nor paused until he had left his foes far behind.&#xD;
He stopped about'two miles north of Fort Forty,&#xD;
and concealed himself in a young, growth of&#xD;
birch. -But though so distant from the scene of&#xD;
conflict, he was by no means in a position free&#xD;
from danger,;and was obliged to remain perfect-&#xD;
ly quiet to escape discovery. It was while thus&#xD;
*den, that he was forced to be an unwilling&#xD;
*ftness of a most cruel spectacle-the tragedy of,&#xD;
what has since been called "Queen Esther's&#xD;
Rock." A number of prisoners, quounting in&#xD;
all to sixteen, were taken to that spot to be offer-&#xD;
ed as sacrifices to savage malice. The Senecas,&#xD;
I Mohawks and Onondagas, formed a circle around&#xD;
the rock, when the victims were brought for-&#xD;
ward and arranged about it in a mournful ring.&#xD;
A fire was'burning brightly near the spot, and&#xD;
by its light Hud'son was able to recognize many&#xD;
of the doomed ones ; among them he saw Mr.&#xD;
Hammond, Hester's father.&#xD;
A weird and horrible-looking squaw, with a&#xD;
war-club, commenced the work of destruction;&#xD;

themselves to a detadhment of Morgan's riflemen&#xD;
under Colonel Parr, and distinguishedthem&#xD;
selves by their gallant deeds. That Ellen was&#xD;
unhappy during the absence of her liege lord;&#xD;
and that Hester was equally miserable on Dun-&#xD;

authentic documents, which can yet be seen-&#xD;
providing they can be found !&#xD;
Zinzendorf and Katherine resided in Wyo-&#xD;

anxieties of this changeful world; but during&#xD;
their lives they enjoyed the society of Roland&#xD;

as much of sublunary happiness as usually falls&#xD;

Peace came with her innumerable blessings,&#xD;
and scattered flowers in the pathway of Roland&#xD;

for many summers Mr. Devron was seen sitting&#xD;
in the sunshine in front of the door, with a cheer-&#xD;
ful, happy face; while Cato was never far off,&#xD;
but ready to attend to his wants with alacrity.&#xD;
Just above, lived the Scout of the Susquehanna;&#xD;

PROM   "THE FLAG OF OUR UNION."]&#xD;
THE CASTLE AND THE CRUCIBLE.&#xD;
BY JAMES DE MILLE.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.                   the alchemist, but his face and form spoke of&#xD;
one who had braved many dangers, and was&#xD;
THE   C RU CI B LE.             still capable of meeting any with fortitude. He&#xD;
MICHAEL SCHWARTZ sat before his crucible, was poring over a strange manuscript, written&#xD;
and with a heavy brazen pestle he pounded up in times long past, with mysterious figures mark-&#xD;
together a quantity of materials. - The chamber ed along the margin. After a while he impa-&#xD;
which he occupied was situated in an upper story tiently threw it down.&#xD;
of a house in Heidelberg. It was small, and   "Schwartz," said he, with the air of one used&#xD;
around its walls were hung many mysterious in- to command, " what is the use of all this&#xD;
struments. There were jars of grotesque shape, why need the adepts,-if there be anything val-&#xD;
andstrange utensils-there wereretorts and stills, able in their knowledge-to lock it up in such&#xD;
mortars and furnaces. These were all arranged mysterious writings ."&#xD;
loosely, and in some places, lay all mingled in  " Ah, son," said the other, calmly, " it is on&#xD;
confusion. A brazier filled with burning coals account of its value that we take such pains to&#xD;

and his snow-white beard descending to his gir-. "Very well-but where is the. elixir vitae,&#xD;
die, gave him an air that inspired every beholder and where is the philosopher's stone I For ages&#xD;
with awe. Hi drs was a lon garment thrown it has been sought'after."&#xD;
loely about him, ad a strange cap was placed  " We must still segk patiently for the great'&#xD;
about his head. j arceanum. Some have arrived near to it. I&#xD;
abon another part of the chan~ber sat a young think-I hope-that there is one who, before he&#xD;
man not more than twen 4lve yeai-a of age. dies, will find it-"&#xD;
He was also dressed in a * ' similar to that of " What ! Can you hope it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have discovered things as wonderful."&#xD;
"As wonderful as the elixir vitce ?" ;&#xD;
" What would you say-were you- to see water&#xD;
burning, or if you should see. air consumed ?&#xD;
What would you say if I weg to1 cut off your&#xD;
leg or the leg of an animal, without any pain to&#xD;
the subject ?"&#xD;
"Impossible !  water  and  air burning?&#xD;
Impossible !"&#xD;
" We keep these things secret. I have found&#xD;
many myself. I tell them to none but a few&#xD;
who can also keep them. Besides, of what value&#xD;
are these, to-the grand mystery of all ?"&#xD;
"If you can-do all that you have said, then.I&#xD;
may almost believe in the gran4,mystery. But,&#xD;
I cannot believe it-water burn? impossible !"&#xD;
" I can, with a few grains of black sand, make&#xD;
thunder and lightning, which wou.4 IgQw this&#xD;
house in which we are, to a thousand pieces."&#xD;
"You? a man ! you make thunder and&#xD;
lightning ?"&#xD;
"I can," replied Schwartz, with the same in -&#xD;
perturbable calmness.. "I am  the first who&#xD;
found out the secret. But if you wish, I will&#xD;
satisfy your curiosity. Be attentive, Albert, and&#xD;
your wonder will be aroused."&#xD;
So saying, he took down a jar from one of the&#xD;
shelves, which was tightly sealed.&#xD;
"What is in, t ?"-n&#xD;
"Nothing. 'Feel it-shake. it. It is full of&#xD;
air. Watch white I take out the stopper.}"&#xD;
He took it out, and turned the jar. Nothing&#xD;
came out. Albert saw nothing ; ~:but moment&#xD;
after Schwartz passed a lighted brand through&#xD;
the air before the jar, and a vivid, flash blinded&#xD;
the eyes of Albert ; for what seemed the air&#xD;
which he breathed, had turned tofire with a hid-&#xD;
eous explosion.&#xD;
" See-the air can be consumed ! Now look&#xD;
at this !" said Schwartz, taking another jar that&#xD;
was filled with liquid. What would you say if&#xD;
I were to burn it?"&#xD;
" Burn it? Impossible !"&#xD;
Schwartz touched it with a. brand, and in-&#xD;
stantlyit flamed, it blazed furiously and fercely,&#xD;
"What? holy virgin! the liquid burns !"1&#xD;
cried Albert.&#xD;
"Ah, son Albert, there are many wondrops&#xD;
things in my science. I raye shown your some-!&#xD;
already. I can show you some more still, But&#xD;
hark ! a knock. Some onecomes"&#xD;
Schwartz went to the deor,aigd opening it,.&#xD;
admitted an aged man dressed mint be coasume of&#xD;
a noble.   -     :     ,           .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Count Hohenfels-welcome !     thrice wel-&#xD;
come i" cried Schwartz, to his noble'visitor. I&#xD;
did not expect you in ipy poor cell."&#xD;
"How do you progress ?"&#xD;
"In the smaller serets,--wonderfully. I have&#xD;
found out the key to many prodigies of nature.&#xD;
I have discovered great things-to make-"&#xD;
"But, no. I caernot for them. How in the&#xD;
great one-the Arcanum-"&#xD;
"I am getting nearer to it. A week ago I&#xD;
had it, but the two liquids united and went off&#xD;
in Are. If I could but reduce that fire to solid--"&#xD;
." You would have it ?"&#xD;
"I would ; for you must know that. gold is&#xD;
solid fire-the essence of flame-"&#xD;
"You talk, wildly-but I pardon it. Your&#xD;
adepts. are always carried away by your secret&#xD;
arts. But Icomehere for the purpose of asking&#xD;
you to Stamberg,,a-small castle which belongs&#xD;
to me, I am going, to the diet. My daughter&#xD;
and her maids, with a few soldiers, have left&#xD;
Hohenfels for the retirement of Stamberg."&#xD;
"0, thanks, thanks ! I will find .everything&#xD;
there, and can.go at once. But I have one re-&#xD;
quest. I wish this youth, my assistant, to go&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
".By all means.. You may bripg a hundred !"&#xD;
cried Count Von Hohenfels, warmly.&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks !" muttered Schwartz; and&#xD;
after a few more words from his'visitor, who also&#xD;
examined some instruments carefully thadept&#xD;
and his scholar were left alone.&#xD;
CHAPTER [I.&#xD;
TIE CASTLE.&#xD;
In the midst of a lovely country where the&#xD;
scenery on every side was grand epd exalting in'&#xD;
the ;extreme, stood the castle of Stamberg. It&#xD;
was small in size, and consisted of a square&#xD;
structure with a courtyard in the midpt., There&#xD;
were no walls around - itbut its line massive&#xD;
front rose, up high ,from. the grogn#, and the&#xD;
structure was flanked at every corner by strong&#xD;
towers.&#xD;
Dills rose up behind, but a deep gully inter-&#xD;
vened, whose steep sides consisted of a vast&#xD;
growth. of tangled, shrubbery of every kind,&#xD;
among which a tree occasionally rose.. Beneath&#xD;
flowed a small torrent, which a few miles below&#xD;
widened and ,emptied into the ,this.,&#xD;
Before,,lay an extended plain, covered with a&#xD;
dense~forest. In clear ah cultivated spot, the&#xD;

THE dASTLE A1cD' CRPCIBLE&#xD;
&#xD;
winding of a river' might be seen, flowing on&#xD;
along the -fertile borders, yielding gladness' all&#xD;
around. The-forest camB'tifto within a mile of&#xD;
the castle, and then stopped, and lovely mead-&#xD;
ows, green fields,' and aventeus of stately trees&#xD;
appeared between.&#xD;
Such was the situation of'Stamberg, one of'&#xD;
the sniitller castles of the CoutVmn Hohenfels,&#xD;
and here his daughter had cotie to pass thetime&#xD;
of his absence in enjoying the beauties of Nature,&#xD;
which lay all-around. A smallgarrison of abo-t'&#xD;
thirty men were there' as a guard, and these ac-&#xD;
companiedher when she wenit out, hovering near&#xD;
her to protect her from those dangers which: in&#xD;
those days were of frequent occurrence. "Upon-&#xD;
such a scene did 'the Lady Adele gaze, as she&#xD;
looked forth from the uppermost terrace.&#xD;
"How beautiful !" she cried. " Howfresh&#xD;
the air is as it comes dver yonder'tistant hills !"&#xD;
As she spake the sun cast a shadow before'her,&#xD;
and she turned.&#xD;
"Ha, the young magician I" she exclaimed,&#xD;
while a slight blush mantled her face.&#xD;
Albert bowed, and stood apart at a respectful&#xD;
distance.&#xD;
"Can you hunt?" she said, to him.&#xD;
I can, fair lady. Many a boar has fallen by&#xD;
my hands. But'you will not hunt to-day ?"&#xD;
"Why not ? I havenot yet been outside the&#xD;
castle." '&#xD;
"Lady, there is danger. The Count Storlach&#xD;
hates your father. The castellain tell me that&#xD;
he is hovering about here."&#xD;
"The Count Storlach ! He would not dare-&#xD;
My father is the Lord of Itohenfels. Youth, you&#xD;
have the spirit of a serf, and are a coward, in&#xD;
spite of your boasts."&#xD;
A deep flush, dyed the cheeks of Albert. He&#xD;
clenched his hands."&#xD;
Thelad'y turned away as though she would&#xD;
Snot notice him.1 At lengh'she spoke.&#xD;
"Gotell the casstllaitifti ge tready the men&#xD;
and arms, for'I will have'u boar hunt."&#xD;
Albert bowed; and withd'rw.r&#xD;
a hisioble 'youth !""murmured Adele, gazing&#xD;
this retiring figure. "Who can he be ? He&#xD;
;;        cspnot be'a base-brin serf. How came he with&#xD;
the maglcian"&#xD;
Perjile~id by curiosity, she steod there;andt n&#xD;
lexgthdparted'to donher huniting garments.&#xD;
Two hours elapsed, and at fs'the'deep tones&#xD;
of the castle belt and'the 'siotes o'thew "idwet's&#xD;
horn sinsibhd'all to the hint. 'Up wen' the&#xD;
peirteullis,'sadinde'fleW'thegat'e : Te whole&#xD;
&#xD;
comp    - departed, and the castle was left with&#xD;
but t F defenders.&#xD;
f M as a gallant sight, as the hunting party&#xD;
rode ragIdlj down toward the plain. The~Lady&#xD;
Adele was at the head. Beside her, and a little&#xD;
way behind, roderlAlbert.'On they went, and&#xD;
disappeared behind a distant hill.&#xD;
Son the loud tones of a trumpet broke 'the&#xD;
silence, and proclaimed that the chase 'was start-&#xD;
ed. Away they went. The boar ran with won-&#xD;
drous speed. Adele and Albert were close be-&#xD;
hind him, while the others were far away.&#xD;
Another was started. It ran toward the castle,&#xD;
and the other hunters- turned from the first to&#xD;
pursue the second.  .&#xD;
" Ha 1" cried Albert, suddenly.  " What's&#xD;
thip ? Th~e bear is nowhere to be seen !"&#xD;
"He ran behind yonder rock." '&#xD;
"But where is he now? Gone ! I see him&#xD;
not."&#xD;
" And where are my men ?" said Adele, sud-&#xD;
denly, and for the first time turning to look.&#xD;
" Men? why-by the holy virgin ! they are&#xD;
all gone-the wretches !"&#xD;
He seized his horn, and bleW aloud, long blast&#xD;
No answer was returned, except the rustling of&#xD;
the wind among the forest trees, and the wild&#xD;
echo of the sound among neighboring rocks.&#xD;
" Gone-truly. They have forgotten who is&#xD;
their mistress. This boar has escaped us. We&#xD;
must-returne"&#xD;
" How far may the castle be from here, lady ?"&#xD;
" Three miles. But sound your horn again.&#xD;
Some of my mn may be near me."&#xD;
Albert again sounded his horn. As the tones&#xD;
tied away in the distance, the blast of another&#xD;
was heard close beside them.&#xD;
Adele started.&#xD;
That is not one of the castle horns."&#xD;
Again'Albert blew his horn. As lie took it&#xD;
'from his moth, a man' at arms came riding&#xD;
round a projecting rock. He saw them and&#xD;
stopped.&#xD;
"Storlach !" cried Adele.&#xD;
Suddenly the man pu spu''s to his horse, and&#xD;
rode'down swiftly, uttering a wild "hallo t."&#xD;
"'Tis one of Storlach's men. See you not&#xD;
his arma ?"&#xD;
"Snrtend r !" criedrthe stranger, in a loud&#xD;
voice, shaking hls spear t Albert.&#xD;
;'  " Surrender?"  should Albert, scornfully.&#xD;
S1)og i'who afe'yoi that eaks thus ?"&#xD;
'The soldier rushed'ljuriddsly at him. Albert&#xD;
wheeled his horse, escaped the blow, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
next-moment his boar spear quivered in the al&#xD;
diet's heart. He fell, and as he touched  .&#xD;
earth, another trumpet note was'lleafd'and from&#xD;
behind the same rock a troop of horsemen came&#xD;
rushing down.&#xD;
"Fly! fly!1" shouted Albert.&#xD;
Away they went, with the speed of the wind.&#xD;
The horses of the two were of the ,nest Spanish&#xD;
breed, brought thence by Hohenfels, and they&#xD;
left behind them the infuriated foe. Shouts fol-&#xD;
lowed them, and the hoarse voice of Storlach&#xD;
himself was heard commanding them to stop.&#xD;
Albert turned, waved.his bloody spear in tri-&#xD;
umph, and again fled. toward the castle.&#xD;
There it'stood-but a mile away. The gates&#xD;
were open, but no man appeared uponthe walls,&#xD;
Nearer-nearer they ,came. No men, could be.&#xD;
seen except the solitary warder.&#xD;
Albert's heart beat with fierce anxiety.&#xD;
" Holy virgin ! The fool of a castellain and&#xD;
his men will be intercepted by Storlach," he mur-&#xD;
mured, as he saw far away a troop of the men of&#xD;
Adele. On they went. They approached the&#xD;
castle. They rushed in. Down went the port-&#xD;
cullis, and swiftly the gates' were closed by the&#xD;
strong hand of Albert.&#xD;
" Great heaven !" cried Adele. " They have&#xD;
not cone home, and Storlach--"&#xD;
"Fear not, lady !" cried Albert. Fear not,&#xD;
but trust in Heaven. While I wield a sword,&#xD;
Storlach shall not enter."&#xD;
"Alas ! what can we do here ?"&#xD;
", The situation is strong."&#xD;
"But Storlach will know that there are no&#xD;
defenders."&#xD;
" How ? The others may escape."        '&#xD;
"Impossible ; but I will see." -&#xD;
They went to the top ofthe keep, and looked&#xD;
down. There appeared. the -men of Stamberg,&#xD;
pursued by Storlach. The troop:of the latter&#xD;
numbered at least. three hundred. The men of&#xD;
Adele fledfaraway,inthe directionto Heidelberg.&#xD;
Albert and Adele watched them long. At&#xD;
last Storlach finding himself far from the castle,&#xD;
returned, and in about an hour the enemy were&#xD;
assembled on the plain below.  I1I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IM'.&#xD;
THE VAULTS.&#xD;
.$ecswartz, in his lonely chamber, knew noih&#xD;
ing of all the events of the day. Evening was&#xD;
coming. The foe was at the castle, but the adept&#xD;
' bent over his crucible and worked as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Schwartz !" said a voice.&#xD;
Suddenly turning, he saw Albert.&#xD;
"Ah, you have come here at last, have you ?&#xD;
The great secret has no charms for you."&#xD;
" I have other business. Schwartz, the castle&#xD;
will be. taken to-norrow. In enemy is before&#xD;
it. The Lady 'Adele will be carried off by a&#xD;
ruffian. If Nature has any valuable secrets, this&#xD;
is the time to show it. ' Think, Schwartz. Pon-&#xD;
der over your stores of knowledge.  Devise&#xD;
some plan whereby all these may be- destroyed,&#xD;
or at least some way in which *e may be saved."&#xD;
Schwartz was silent.&#xD;
'" Ha! hive you nothing? -Foolish old man !&#xD;
Of what avail is alltiudr'knowledge ?"&#xD;
"Peace, son. An enemy? The Lady Adele&#xD;
'taken?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes," cried Albert, impatiently.&#xD;
'4Albert; I have that which is powerful enough&#xD;
to send all these enemies to perdition."&#xD;
" Have you ?" cried Albert, in delight.&#xD;
" Since my coming here, I have been making&#xD;
great quantities of the powerful substance. -Did&#xD;
I not say I could make thunder and lightning ?"&#xD;
" You did-but you cannot."&#xD;
" See here, incredulous youth ; this is the&#xD;
substance in' which lies the :power of the&#xD;
thunderbolt."&#xD;
He took some black substance from a crucible&#xD;
near him. Albert looked. He laid itupon the&#xD;
table and touched it with a coal. A blinding&#xD;
flash, and a loud explosion followed.&#xD;
"Albert, I have large quantities of this in the&#xD;
vaults beneath. Count Hohenfels knows its&#xD;
power. I have shown it to 'him."&#xD;
" Well."&#xD;
" The enemy will attack us to-morrow. To-.&#xD;
morrow.you shall, see them all cold in- death.&#xD;
But take you the Lady Adele. Fly to yonder&#xD;
height on the other side of the gully. Be there&#xD;
by dawn, and you shall see some of my power.&#xD;
The warder shall stay with me. We willjoin&#xD;
you early."&#xD;
And the adept again turned to his crucible.&#xD;
Through that night Schwartz and the warder&#xD;
were busy in the vaults,.. They lay beneath the&#xD;
courtyard of the castle. ,There were largo ves-&#xD;
sels filled with great quantities of a strange,&#xD;
black substance. It was the first time in many&#xD;
years that the warder had entered here, for the&#xD;
!ceunt was careful about the vaults, and never&#xD;
permitted any one to visit them.&#xD;
In front of the castle, Storlach was encamped&#xD;
with his men. As he knew not the number of&#xD;

those within the castle, he concluded to wait till&#xD;
morning and then make'his attack.&#xD;
Morning game. The first streaks of light as-&#xD;
Ceed frn the .eastern horizon  ind gradually&#xD;
the sombre shadoyl -departedgiadually the&#xD;
dawn came on. .tTpon thi summit of a wooded&#xD;
height,'on the other side of the gylly,;A Bert and-&#xD;
Adele stood. At midnight they had leti -the cas-&#xD;
tie, and from this; bill they could gaze unseen&#xD;
upon the castle and the foe.&#xD;
As the sun rose, a trumpet spunded in Stor-&#xD;
lach's camp, and so9p..l were in Inotig. The.&#xD;
soldiers rose and donned their armor and girded&#xD;
on their apns4 Then, at tb second signals the&#xD;
whole troop mstrched in order toward the castle,&#xD;
No' one could be seen, eithe;, on the walls, or&#xD;
within any turret. Not a sound could be heard,&#xD;
not the slightest sign of life could be discovered.&#xD;
" Thereis some trick here l" cried Storlach.&#xD;
"Be careful-be wary, my men. herald, do&#xD;
your duty." 'of]&#xD;
" I summon this - castle to surrender, in the&#xD;
name of. Count Reinrich von Storlach, Lord of&#xD;
Stdrlach and Dowenstein.",..., i&#xD;
No answer came. All,was still.&#xD;
Three times the herald sounded, and made his&#xD;
summons. Thep Storlach grewnimpatient. "On,&#xD;
my soldiers ! We will teach them the danger of&#xD;
despising -s,"  With a loud shout the whole&#xD;
troop poured through the gate into -the court-&#xD;
yard,  The inner castle ddors were closed.&#xD;
Storlach shouted : " Open the doors !" No an-&#xD;
swercame. His men with their heavy halberds&#xD;
began to thunder upon; them.&#xD;
Four persons stood on the height beyond.&#xD;
Besides Albert and Adele, there was the. old&#xD;
warder, -and Schwartz.  As the noise of the&#xD;
sumtntlsi and the sounds of blows camelto their&#xD;
ears;, they gazed with intense anxiety.'&#xD;
"The hour is nearly up '"muttered Schwartz..&#xD;
" Surely the fire has almost reached-"&#xD;
aitddenly, with awful vividness-as though a&#xD;
hurricane had burst.upon them-with blinding,&#xD;
dazzling brilliancy, burst forth a flash of light-.&#xD;
streaming, pouring, upward and around,hi al&#xD;
directions from the'castle. A deafening noise&#xD;
followed,-a noise as deep and awful as'thie roar&#xD;
of' thunder. Large masses of stones and beams;&#xD;
&#xD;
of doors and gates, unshapely fragments of&#xD;
work and tiron  ar*, mingled all together&#xD;
nechatic mass, were hurled' into the air.&#xD;
en were inhrov nup, and torn to pieces by the&#xD;
ter  e power of the explosion.' The massive&#xD;
walls and lofty towers trembled, and fell head=&#xD;
long down. When the volumes of thick smoke&#xD;
rolled away nothing was left of the castle of'&#xD;
Stamberg except a black and fearful ruin.&#xD;
Messengers were sent by Adele from -Hohen.&#xD;
'fels to her father. He returned, and when he&#xD;
heard of all that had passed, his gratitude and&#xD;
joy knew no bounds.&#xD;
And what, brave youth, can I give to you as&#xD;
a reward for delivering my daughter from Stor-&#xD;
lch ? Speak!" said het to Albert, who stood'&#xD;
modestly apart with a large, mantle wrapped&#xD;
around him.&#xD;
Albert walked up towards the beautiful Adele,&#xD;
who stood confused and anxious.&#xD;
"Count Hilbert von Hohenfels, you think me&#xD;
a serf-a low-born vassal to some poor knight.,&#xD;
I am not so. In me-" And as he spoke, the&#xD;
mantle was loosened from him. "In me you&#xD;
see Alberto Colonna-head of the most princely&#xD;
house in Italy!"  The mantle fell. He was&#xD;
dressed in richest armor.&#xD;
" Colonna! you Colonna! an Italian ?"&#xD;
" Even so. I had heard of the famous adept,&#xD;
Michael Schwartz, and cameto Germany for.the&#xD;
purpose of learning some of his science. I am&#xD;
soon to return. Count Hohenfels, you wish me&#xD;
to name my reward. Here is -all I ask." And&#xD;
he took the willing hand of Adele.&#xD;
" Take her, Colonna. = Take her, and with her&#xD;
my blessing.' You have won her. You deserve&#xD;
her, and: the princely. cpronet of Colonna could&#xD;
not deck a fairer brow than that of' my daughter&#xD;
Adele von Hohenfels.&#xD;
Schwartz found not the elixir vita. Immortal-&#xD;
ity he could not gain in the way he wished, but&#xD;
through the despised black substance he won&#xD;
everlasting fame, and immortality of another&#xD;
kind. For among the great names of the mid.&#xD;
die ages, none is more widely known than that&#xD;
of Michael Schwartz, the inventor of gunpowder.&#xD;
