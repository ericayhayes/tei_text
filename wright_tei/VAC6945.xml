               </argument>
               <p>BEAUTIFUL and breezy had been a bright autumnal day. The sun in all his refulgent
                  splendor was sinking beneath the ocean's swelling bosom, imparting a golden glow
                  to the sky of the occident and gilding the crests of the billows. And as the
                  bright golden shield disappeared beneath the surface, the light wind died away,
                  leaving the ocean like a mirror of burnished steel, in which the blue arch above,
                  now studded with the first stars of evening, and the crescent queen of night were
                  distinctly visible.</p>
               <p>Fifty leagues south of the Great Antilles, a noble vessel lay becalmed; a cloud of
                  canvas hung uselessly from her spars, and a score of sailors lay idling away the
                  time upon her upper deck. She proved to be an American merchantman from Canton,
                  bound to New York, richly laden with silks, spices, teas, specie, and other
                  valuables. On the quarter deck were the officers of the ship, and a young
                  gentleman, a passenger, of pleasing address, who walked to and fro with an anxious
                  expression upon his handsome countenance, and scarcely heeding some pleasant
                  sallies of wit which were directed towards him by the fat, jolly, companionable
                  captain. Presently, a pretty quadroon<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6945-00000003"/> girl
                  emerged from the cabin, and whispered in his ears. He followed her into the cabin,
                  and after a lapse of a few minutes he returned, and again paced the deck with the
                  same troubled and impatient look as before.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Harry, cheer up," said the captain, "you're as dull as this
                  confounded calm. What news from below.?"</p>
               <p>"Captain, I am in no humor for foolish jests," replied Henry Bertine.</p>
               <p>"Avast there, my friend," said the captain; "do you call that a jest? If so, tell
                  me, how is your good lady?"</p>
               <p>"I trust she will be better soon," said he, soberly.</p>
               <p>"Fear not; our physician has the reputation of being skillful in that particular
                  branch of his profession; therefore, my friend, cheer up! cheer up! Here has a
                  whole half day passed, and you've been gloomy as a Dutch skipper in a fog! Not so
                  much as a smile has been seen on your features to-day. If you wear that sorry
                  figure head much longer, we shall all have the blue devils!"</p>
               <p>The young man made no reply to the good natured remarks of the captain, and it was
                  doubtful whether he was aware of being addressed, so intent was his mind upon the
                  cause of his anxiety.</p>
               <p>"If it should happen to be a boy, Harry," continued the jocular captain, "I claim
                  the right of giving it a name. Let me see—yes, it shall be named after the old
                  ship—Admiral Bertine!—excellent!—an honorable name—a title without the station;
                  but if it should be one of the other kind, which is altogether probable, for my
                  wife has presented me with seven of 'em to one boy, why we'll christen it—let's
                  see—I can't think of a good one—ah! I have it—Oceana!—Oceana Bertine! Beautiful!
                  isn't it, Harry?"</p>
               <p>A faint smile did for a moment illumine the features of the young man, but it was
                  unperceived by the captain.</p>
               <p>Some ten or fifteen minutes more elapsed, when the physician appeared.</p>
               <p>Henry Bertine seized him by the hand, and without uttering a syllable, looked
                  anxiously into his face. A smile of satisfaction greeted him.</p>
               <p>"I give you joy," said the physician.</p>
               <p>"Is it a boy?" ejaculated the captain.</p>
               <p>"How is my Isabella?" asked the anxious husband.</p>
               <p>"I'll wager my best bower it's one of the other kind," interrupted the captain.
                  "That's always my luck."</p>
               <p>"Is she well——"</p>
               <p>"As can be expected," said the physician, finishing Harry's sentence.</p>
               <p>"Ah! there comes Sybil," said the captain, as the quadroon servant came on deck,
                  bearing something with tender care in her arms. "Now Sybil, my yellow beauty,
                  let's know what you've got there."</p>
               <p>"Missis' babby, massa," answered the maid.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Rose?"</p>
               <p>"A babby, massa."</p>
               <p>"What sex, I mean?"</p>
               <p>"Fair seck, massa captain," said the delighted quadroon, as she proceeded to
                  unfold the richly embroidered blanket which concealed the little innocent.</p>
               <p>"I told you so!" exclaimed the captain. "I would have wagered my third of the old
                  Admiral's cargo that it would turn up a girl. Well, it is a chubby, rosy little
                  creature," he continued, peeping over the servant's shoulder, while she pointed
                  out its infantile perfection to the newly-made father and the physician. "Harry, I
                  congratulate you—give us your hand, and no more of that brown study. Rather let us
                  have some brown sherry, and be merry. Here, steward, bring up a bottle of that old
                  golden sherry. We must have a christening."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart," said the now delighted father, "and I agree to the name I
                  heard fall from your lips. It is highly appropriate."</p>
               <p>The steward now appeared with a bottle of most excellent sherry, and wine glasses,
                  which he arranged on a portable stand.</p>
               <p>"Now, steward, draw that cork steadily," cautioned the captain; "handle it with as
                  much tenderness as Rose does the infant. Ah! that will do; now, Harry, Doctor, let
                  me fill your glasses with a wine fit to christen an angel with. Here, Mr. Sampson
                  and Mr. Kay," said he, addressing his two subordinate officers, "join with us in
                  christening this child of Neptune."</p>
               <p>All the glasses being filled, the captain proposed the following:</p>
               <p>"Here's to the health and happiness of OCEANA BERTINE! God bless her!"</p>
               <p>The glasses were scarcely emptied, when a faint flash was seen, the report of a
                  gun came booming over the sea, and a shot came whizzing over the heads of the
                  officers, perforating in its course the mizzen and main top-gallant sail, and
                  spending its force against the fore-topsail yard!</p>
               <p>"In heaven's name, where's that shot from!" shouted Captain Stark, dropping his
                  wine glass upon the deck, which shivered to atoms, and springing into the mizzen
                  rigging.</p>
               <p>"Sail, ho!" cried out a man from the mast head.</p>
               <p>"Where away!" demanded the captain.</p>
               <p>"Directly astern!" was the response.</p>
               <p>"What is she?"</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6945-00000004"/>
               <p>"A brigantine, with boats out, towing down upon us.</p>
               <p>"Steward, my night-glass!" shouted the captain. "Be lively—I smell mischief."</p>
               <p>The glass was handed him, and after surveying the suspicious vessel for a few
                  moments he leaped upon deck, and said to his chief mate,—</p>
               <p>"I can't exactly make her out. There are but few men in the boats, and two only
                  visible upon her deck; but I like not her looks. Pipe all hands on deck, and
                  prepare for the worst." Then turning to his physician and passenger he
                  said—"Gentlemen, I wish to create no unnecessary alarm, but as certain as my name
                  is Stark, I believe that we shall shortly be attacked by pirates!"</p>
               <p>"Merciful God, what's to be done?" ejaculated Bertine, as he thought of the
                  helpless condition of his wife and child.</p>
               <p>"Fight to the last! Fight like demons!—like pirates!" promptly answered the bold
                  commander. "If they do not outnumber us they shall not be masters of the Admiral
                  while I have power to wield this right arm. Mr. Kay," he continued, addressing the
                  second officer, "see that our swivels are mounted, muskets put in order, muster on
                  deck every pistol, pike and cutlass!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir," responded the second mate.</p>
               <p>"Then hoist up a few kegs of powder!—roll two into my cabin! If necessary I'l give
                  the devils a warmer reception than they dream of!"</p>
               <p>There was a terrible meaning in the captain's last words, which caused his
                  subordinate to quail with terror.</p>
               <p>"You surely do not intend——"</p>
               <p>"Question me not!" interrupted the courageous man. "I know my responsibility and
                  my duty. See that my commands are obeyed to the very letter! Have every man armed,
                  swivels and muskets loaded, and every necessary preparation to fight to the
                  last!"</p>
               <p>The officer went forward to put into execution his superior's orders. In half an
                  hour's time, all available means of the ship were brought into requisition to give
                  the pirates battle.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the suspicious craft gained slowly upon the merchantman, occasionally
                  firing a salute, which did no other damage than to carry away the main royal yard,
                  and parting some of her light rigging.</p>
               <p>As Captain Stark predicted, the chase was a pirate, and commanded by the devil
                  incarnate, RED MARTIN, the noted chief of a piratical squadron, consisting of
                  three vessels, called the Thunderbolt, the Raven, and the Shark. The two latter
                  were at this time in command of two pirates who were known by the pseudonyms of
                  BLACKBEARD and SCARLET JACK. As these personages have conspicuous parts to enact
                  in our drama, we shall here give a brief description of each.</p>
               <p>The Chief of the Thunderbolt, Red Martin, was none other than the celebrated
                  Martini Benavides, a man of herculean frame, and whose exploits on the coast of
                  South America and in the Gulf of Mexico, had made his name a terror to all the
                  navigators of those seas. He acquired the name of Red Martin, not so much from his
                  sanguinary career, as from a regular practice of besmearing his face, hand and
                  arms with red paint, whenever he went into an egagement, in order to make himself
                  as hideous as possible in the eyes of his antagonist. He wore a sabre of immense
                  length and weight, one that could not have been wielded by an arm less powerful
                  than his. At one blow, in his right arm, this formidable blade had severed in two
                  a hempen cable of three inches diameter. He also carried in his belt a pair of
                  huge pistols, either of which would send a ball through an oaken plank. Thus
                  armed, no living man could oppose him in combat. He was feared by his crew, and
                  even by his compeers in crime, Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack. Never had his
                  courageous soul quaked with fear, although desperate and bloody had been many of
                  his encounters. Red Martin had a wife, who accompanied him on all of his piratical
                  expeditions. She was a woman of noble mien, courageous, and, although she could
                  cheer on men in the conflict, yet after the victory was won, she would do all in
                  her power to prevent any cold-blooded barbarities from being committed. Her maiden
                  name was Anne Bonney, but having married Red Martin, she was after-ward's called
                  Haidee, the Fearless. She exercised a powerful influence over her husband, and had
                  not only frequently subdued his ferocious temper, but whenever she exacted from
                  him a promise, she never permitted him to break it. [<hi rend="i"/>For a Portrait
                  of this remarkable woman, see engraving, page 17.]</p>
               <p>Blackbeard, from the fact of his having invaded the Carolinas, had gained more
                  notoriety in the world than even Red Martin, although in every particular, he was
                  very much his inferior. His real name was Teach, but he gained the appellation of
                  Blackbeard from the fact of his wearing a long, bushy black beard, that encircled
                  his chin from ear to ear. Bristol, England, claims to be the birth-place of this
                  renowned buccaneer, and at the time we find him commanding the Raven, a schooner
                  of eighteen guns, it was in the early part of his career as a corsair. His
                  history, subsequent to the incidents of this narrative, is already known to the
                  world.</p>
               <p>Scarlet Jack, the chief officer of the third vessel in Red Martin's squadron, was
                  a Portuguese by birth, a young man of pleasing manners and genteel in person; he
                  was mild as a lamb when in the society of his associates, but when the battle
                     raged,<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6945-00000005"/> he could exhibit all the
                  ferocity of a hungry tiger. For two years he was Red Martin's lieutenant and
                  confidential adviser, and when the Shark was added to the squadron, she was placed
                  under his command. He gained the sobriquet of Scarlet Jack, from constantly
                  wearing, when on duty, a richly embroidered scarlet cap, and a scarlet jacket
                  trimmed with gold lace. He boasted of having been descended from one of the most
                  noble families of Portugal, but having committed a high political offence, was
                  obliged to seek a refuge from his family and his country. He boasted, too, of
                  having received a collegiate education at Madrid, which was most probably correct,
                  for he was not only master of the Italian, French and Spanish languages, but was
                  familiar with the Latin and Greek classics. There were several peculiar traits in
                  his character, which developed themselves during many incidents which will be
                  introduced into these pages of romantic adventures.</p>
               <p>Twilight had passed, and night, made beautiful by a clear atmosphere and
                  innumerable stars, came over the scene, when the piratical brigantine had come
                  within hailing distance of the merchantman.</p>
               <p>"Ship ahoy!" shouted a voice through a speaking trumpet.</p>
               <p>"Hallo!" was the loud response of Captain Stark.</p>
               <p>"What ship is that?"</p>
               <p>"The Admiral, of and bound for New York. Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"The Thunderbolt! For further particulars look aloft!" and at the moment Red
                  Martin's dread flag was run up to the main truck. "Send your chief officer and
                  papers aboard!" demanded the pirate.</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge no authority under the black flag!" replied Captain Stark.</p>
               <p>A shot from the pirate, which passed over the quarter deck of the ship, was the
                  reply to this denial of the pirate's power. The two boats, which had been towing
                  the brigantine, were brought alongside, and were quickly filled with pirates,
                  armed with cutlasses and small fire-arms. Commanded by the lieutenant of the
                  brigantine, the attacking party set off, anticipating an easy capture of the
                  ship.</p>
               <p>"No quarter!" cried the chief to his lieutenant, as the boats put off.</p>
               <p>All was silent as death on board the ship. The crew, with the exception of two who
                  had charge of the swivel, were ranged along the bulwarks, each armed with a musket
                  and boarding-pike, and an order was given not to fire a gun, until the word should
                  be heard. Onward came the buccaneers, elated with the prospect of securing so rich
                  a prize as they supposed the merchantman to be, little imagining how warm a
                  reception they were likely to meet with.</p>
               <p>The boats were within six rods of the ship. The pirates were full of exultation
                  and glee; but suddenly these were changed to groans, death-struggles, and
                  blasphemous anathemas! A well directed volley of musketry, including a shower of
                  deadly missiles from the swivel, had caused dismay, death and destruction in the
                  attacking party. One of the boats was stove, and sunk immediately with more than
                  half the crew, while the remaining were floundering about, with Death staring them
                  in the face! In the other boat, several were killed, including the lieutenant,
                  while many were severely wounded. Those of the crew who were not disabled, picked
                  up several of their comrades, and rowed with all possible dispatch towards the
                  brigantine; and of the two boats' crews, consisting of thirty men, only nine
                  returned, and two of them had received mortal wounds.</p>
               <p>Red Martin stood on his deck and watched the terrible destruction of the
                  expedition, which so sadly decimated his force. He raved and cursed like a madman,
                  and vowed the most summary vengeance; and no sooner was the returning boat out of
                  range of his guns than he poured a whole broadside into the ship, which stove in
                  her starboard bulwarks and carried away the mizzenmast; but the quick apprehension
                  of Captain Stark caused him to order every man below, thinking that the corsair
                  chief would aim to rake the ship's deck by a whole broadside, as soon as the boat
                  was out of the way of his guns. Again and again was the broadside repeated, doing
                  considerable damage to spars, rigging and sails, but as yet only one man had
                  fallen.</p>
               <p>Expecting that the brigantine would range alongside for the purpose of boarding,
                  Captain Stark made every preparation to repel such attack, and in case they
                  succeeded, he had his swivel mounted aft, and loaded to the muzzle with bullets,
                  to sweep his own deck. He, as well as all on board, had determined to die in
                  defence of the ship, rather than surrender to the pirates, and to sell their lives
                  as dearly as possible. There was hope, faint to be sure, that they might be the
                  victors, or at least to beat off all the attacks of the ruthless foe; but this
                  hope vanished when two other vessels, each with the corsair flag flying, were
                  descried in the dim distance, coming down with a light breeze which had sprung
                  up.</p>
               <p>Red Martin signalized to the Raven and Shark not to fire into the hull of the
                  ship, thereby endangering the prize so dearly won, but to board her simultaneously
                  on the larboard and starboard bows.</p>
               <p>This order was obeyed. The Shark came down to windward, while the Raven beat up to
                  leeward. The former having come alongside first, they could not act in
                  concert.</p>
               <p>Scarlet Jack, himself, led on the boarders, and like so many<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000006"/> devils they seemed as they clambered over the
                  cat-heads, bulwarks, &amp;c. Now the deadly strife was renewed with a vigor too
                  terrible for description. The pirates fought with heavy cutlasses and pistols, and
                  were met with pikes, swords and muskets. Captain Stark and young Bertine were in
                  the foremost of the fray, and fought like chafed lions; many a pirate lay
                  weltering in his gore by their well directed blows. Inch by inch was that bloody
                  deck contested, until only seven persons, besides the Captain and Bertine, of that
                  ship's company remained. These fought with desperation, and for a time
                  successfully coped with four times their number. They had retreated to the
                  quarter-deck, as Blackbeard's crew of devils, uttering hellish cries, came
                  clambering over the starboard bulwarks, eager to participate in the fight.</p>
               <p>The swivel was now brought into requisition, and the captain, himself, applied the
                  match. The discharge swept all before it—the carnage was so great that for a
                  moment or two the pirates were staggered; but perceiving only half a dozen men
                  contending against their scores, they rallied and impetuously rushed on to the
                  attack, and a large body of pirates was directly in the midst of the brave ship's
                  defenders, when another discharge of the swivel did terrible execution, not only
                  in range of the piece, but on all around—for the gun had burst, and the fragments
                  of iron did their worst—the havoc was awful!</p>
               <p>Four only of that resolute crew remained, standing on that purple-dyed deck; these
                  were seized with weapons still in their hands, dragged forward and lashed to the
                  windlass, to receive a tortured death thereafter.</p>
               <p>The pirates looked among the slain for the body of the commander of the
                  merchantman, but it was nowhere to be found. He had disappeared during the
                  confusion incident to the bursting of the swivel, and the pirates conjectured that
                  he must have been blown overboard.</p>
               <p>The chief of the squadron now came on board, and the pirates gave three loud
                  huzzas for the victory they had so dearly achieved!</p>

                     the Three Pirates.—Noble Conduct of Haidee, Red Martin's Bride—The Oath.—The

               </argument>
               <p>THE BATTLE, which had raged with interruptions for nearly two hours, was now over.
                  All was peaceful as were the elements of sea and air before the conflict. The
                  corsair crew were now apparently in undisturbed possession of the merchantman.
                  Every part of her had been visited by the pirates, with the exception of the
                  quarter-deck cabin, for Red Martin held it as an offence in his squadron for any
                  man to precede him into the cabin of any prize which might fall into their hands,
                  unless the extreme emergency of the case absolutely required it.</p>
               <p>The door of the cabin was closed, and Red Martin stepped forward to exercise his
                  prerogative. He found the door bolted upon the inside; he unsheathed his sabre and
                  with one blow of the formidable weapon the bolt gave way and he crossed the
                  threshold.</p>
               <p>Here a scene presented itself, wholly unexpected to the Pirate Chief, and struck
                  amazement to the soul of him whose indomitable courage was never known to desert
                  him.</p>
               <p>There sat on a raised seat, in the centre of the cabin, the yet unconquered
                  captain of the Admiral, as firm as a statue upon the foundation of a rock. A few
                  feet in front of him stood a cask of gunpowder, and, forming a half circle around
                  him, was a thick train of the same exploding material, which had been poured from
                  another cask. In his right hand he held a pistol, and in his left a flaming torch.
                  His hardy features were calm, rigid and resolute. He sat with all the firmness and
                  dignity of an enthroned monarch! Satan in Council, with an orb for a throne, as
                  portrayed by Milton, looked not more terribly dignified than this man of
                  courage!</p>
               <p>Even the huge form of Red Martin, that never recoiled in confronting an adversary,
                  started back at the scene before him. He gazed for a few moments into the
                  captain's stern countenance, and he saw, as if it had been stamped with dies of
                  fire, DETERMINATION on every lineament!</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6945-00000007"/>
               <p>A pressure of the finger upon the weapon's trigger, or a fall of the bright
                  flambeau in his hand, would blow the ship to atoms, and send into eternity every
                  soul on board! It was an awful catastrophe even for contemplation.</p>
               <p>While the captain's facial muscles moved not; while not the slightest expression
                  of fear was detected, the Pirate Chief's whole frame trembled with terror! Bold
                  and hideous as the monster looked, with his painted visage, and bare, blood-dyed
                  arms, he lacked the valor to advance a single step, or give utterance to a single
                  word! He trembled, who trembled never before! He beheld for the first time a
                  mortal whom he feared! The mighty weapon which had never been stricken from his
                  powerful grasp, fell from his tremulous hand by its own weight!</p>
               <p>"Senor Capitan!" exclaimed a familiar voice behind the awestruck chief. "Are you
                  hurt? What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>Red Martin, with faltering step turned around, and his two compeers, Blackbeard
                  and Scarlet Jack, stood before him.</p>
               <p>"Look! behold!" exclaimed the trembling chief, pointing to the scene which had
                  struck consternation to his hardened soul. "We're'on the brink of hell!"</p>
               <p>"I see!" said Blackbeard, as he advanced a step; "but it amazes me not so much as
                  to behold the mighty heart of Red Martin subdued by a scarecrow! This is a
                  coward's device, brave chief! The d——d poltroon has not the nerve for such a deed.
                  Be this business mine. Hell and furies! I'll have this braggadocio quartered
                  alive, and each quarter dangling aloft, if in five minutes he does not surrender
                  to our power!"</p>
               <p>Then advancing a step or two more, Blackbeard stood before the man who had made a
                  coward of his chief.</p>
               <p>"A cunning device, truly," said he, with a demoniacal grin, addressing Stark.
                  "Surrender! or by all the demons of the infernal regions I'll have you dismembered
                  alive!"</p>
               <p>The captain sat unmoved and made no reply.</p>
               <p>"SURRENDER!" again shouted Blackbeard, in a tone of thunder.</p>
               <p>"NEVER! to mortal man! much less to an inhuman butcher like thee!" said Stark,
                  with a solemn and determined voice.</p>
               <p>"Mark this! I can send you into eternity in a moment!" said Blackbeard, drawing
                  from his belt a pistol.</p>
               <p>"And in an equal time I can send you and all your hellish crew to Satan, your
                  master!" replied the undaunted captain, brandishing the dreaded flambeau above his
                  head! "Fire! blood-thirsty monster, if you have the courage! With my fall, falls
                  this blazing torch into that combustible train, which not only encircles me but
                  leads to a vent in the cask, and thence to a well-filled powder magazine beneath
                  your feet! You shall all be blown to hell's blazes together, where you belong!
                  Think you that I have made this preparation to awe you and thereby save my life? I
                  have made my peace with God, and now stand on the brink of eternity! I have put it
                  beyond your power to torture me, so that all your threats are vain! It is I who
                  yet am commander here, and will command to the last gasp!—and when Captain Stark
                  surrenders unconditionally, it will be only to Him who sits in judgment above!
                  Now, damned devil, as you are, I command you to surrender!"</p>
               <p>These sentences were uttered in a firm, deliberate and solemn manner! and each
                  word fell like a stone upon the damned soul of the Pirate. He, like his chief, was
                  appalled—dismayed! He felt that it were vain indeed to attempt to resist one who
                  could look Death so calmly in the face! Decision was expressed in every sentence
                  that was uttered! He might as well have attempted to change the destructive agent
                  before him into so many grains of sand, as to change the determination of that
                  resolute man, who had him and all on board in his dread power! Blackbeard, like
                  Red Martin, was subdued!—he, too, shuddered with fear! Had he been in the presence
                  of Lucifer, instead of a resolute mortal, his dread would not have been greater.
                  The cutlass which he held in his right hand loosened from the Pirate's grasp, and
                  it fell across the huge sabre of the Chief.</p>
               <p>"Extinguish the flambeau, and your life shall be spared!" at length said
                  Blackbeard, with forced utterance.</p>
               <p>"Think you I would take the word of a merciless wretch like yourself; or the word
                  of any one of your hell hounds?" ejaculated the immovable man.</p>
               <p>"Our oaths!"</p>
               <p>"The oath of Satan should have the preference! Besides, my life is not to be
                  considered, when I can make such a glorious sacrifice of it!—when I can by a
                  single movement free the world of a ruthless band of cut-throats!"</p>
               <p>"What would you, bold man?" said Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"Summon your compeers in crime, if they dare stand in my dread presence!" said
                  Stark, with the air of a sovereign; "and here I will reveal to your wondering gaze
                  a sight that should move to pity a heart harder than adamant! Be quick! for I am
                  ready for eternity!"</p>
               <p>Blackbeard retired from the cabin, and the three pirate commanders held a
                  consultation over the capstan of the ship. They then returned to the cabin, and
                  made an obeisant sign to their superior in power. Meanwhile the pirates were
                  absent, Captain Stark had put aside the folding doors which divided his cabin into
                  two apartments, the smaller one being occupied by all save one of his family of
                  passengers, and the missing one was the brave Bertine, who, he supposed, perished
                  in their last effort against the enemy. This being done, he reseated himself,
                  reassumed a kingly dignity, and held his pistol and flambeau as before.</p>
               <pb n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6945-00000008"/>
               <p>"Behold! but approach not another step!" said Stark, pointing to the scene he had
                  disclosed to view.</p>
               <p>On a luxurious couch, with pallid cheeks, weak from confinement, and unconscious
                  of the terrible events of that night, reclined a young and beautiful lady, and
                  nestling on her immaculate bosom, was an infant scarcely four hours old. Beside
                  the couch, sat Sybil, a quadroon maid, watching tenderly with tearful eyes her
                  charge, and ready to render every service in her power to the helpless ones;—and
                  when the bloody buccaneers looked upon this living table an, she fell upon her
                  knees and in a prayerful attitude gazed imploringly upon the savage brutes.</p>
               <p>"Spare! oh, spare these helpless ones!" was her only exclamation.</p>
               <p>"Look upon that moving picture!" resumed the Captain; "and if you are not in
                  reality the hell-hounds of Lucifer, let compassion once find a place in your stern
                  hearts. In this night's bloody work, you have rendered that helpless woman
                  husbandless, and that innocent babe fatherless! Look, I charge you, with eyes of
                  sympathy and mercy! If not with mercy upon them, gaze upon me as their dread
                  Avenger!"</p>
               <p>A profound silence for a few moments ensued.</p>
               <p>"Let me now be answered," said Stark; "shall they be spared from harm—all harm, I
                  say?"</p>
               <p>The Pirates looked at each other, and said:</p>
               <p>"They shall!"</p>
               <p>"Then, listen; order your crews to abandon the ship forthwith, and return to their
                  respective vessels; and, mark me, harm not my four men whom you have lashed to the
                  windlass. This done, your own lives shall be spared; you shall return in safety to
                  continue your ruthless business until the vengeance of Heaven shall overtake you;
                  but there is another condition: ere you leave, each of you shall take a solemn
                  oath upon the Holy Evangelists, that you will not fire a single shot into the hull
                  or rigging of this ship, or otherwise strive to do us evil! Perform all this, and
                  I will withhold executing my great and glorious purpose!"</p>
               <p>The Pirates again looked at each other and nodded assent.</p>
               <p>"All of this we promise," said Red Martin.</p>
               <p>"Impossible!" cried a female voice; and a handsome heroic-looking woman, who had
                  stood in the rear of the Pirates and had heard and seen all, now stepped before
                  them with an air of superiority.</p>
               <p>"Silence!" cried Red Martin, the husband of the heroic Haidee, who knew full well
                  what his wife was intent upon revealing.</p>
               <p>"Be silent, thyself!" commanded Haidee; "it is my will that you shall not deceive
                  that brave man, and thus ensure the destruction<figure>

                  Know, courageous man, that in less than two hours this ship will have sunk beneath
                  the ocean's surface! She is scuttled!"</p>
               <p>"Traitress!" muttered Red Martin.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" cried Stark; "then is it time we should make the sacrifice! Prepare for the
                  Life Eternal!" he loudly exclaimed, brandishing the dread flambeau above his
                  head.</p>
               <p>"Hold! in mercy's name, hold!" implored Haidee, falling upon her knees; "not for
                  my sake but for the sake of those innocent beings whom you, in your nobleness of
                  soul, would sacrifice all to save! The Pirate Chieftain's wife can save them! I,
                  Haidee, can save them! There is great hope! Here, Martin! and you, Blackbeard! and
                  you, Scarlet Jack! swear upon this cross, the oath I will dictate!"</p>
               <p>Haidee, while speaking, arose from her kneeling posture, and taking a golden cross
                  from her bosom, which was suspended from a rosary about her neck, she held it up
                  before the inhuman butchers.</p>
               <p>"If you would spare your own lives, the lives of your crew, and the life of
                  Haidee, repeat after me the oath I will dictate."</p>
               <p>The terms of the oath were dictated by Haidee, and repeated by each of the Pirate
                  Captains. In substance it was as follows:</p>
               <p>"By the Holy Virgin—the immaculate mother of <unclear>Jesus</unclear>—we solemnly
                  swear that to Haidee, we will give all <unclear>authority concerning</unclear> the
                  disposition of the surviving crew and <unclear/> of this ship, and will refrain
                  from all interference <unclear>which would</unclear> allow any person under our
                  authority to interfere with said charge; and we also swear that we will assist
                  Haidee to the utmost of our power, in the furtherance of her plans in regard to
                  said persons."</p>
               <p>The oath being concluded, the Pirates reverently kissed the golden cross, as
                  commanded by that resolute woman, whom all had a superstitious awe of, for she
                  had, in their sight, more than once worked what they supposed to be miracles.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Interview between Red Martin and Haidee.—Her views in regard to the
                     Americans.—A Spanish Galleon descried.—The Pirate Chief resolves on making her
                     his Prize.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"MARTIN," said Haidee, drawing her husband aside after the administration of the
                  oath, "have I not done well?"</p>
               <p>"What has just passed is so strange, I am at a loss what to think. No living man
                  ever cowed the soul of Red Martin until encountered by that dare-devil!"</p>
               <p>"You do not answer me, Martin," resumed the fearless woman; "have I not saved your
                  life, ay, the lives of your formidable band from destruction?"</p>
               <p>"You have, Haidee."</p>
               <p>"<unclear>And you</unclear> will keep the oath?"</p>
               <p>"<unclear>Did Red</unclear> Martin ever break a vow to Haidee?"</p>
               <p>"<unclear>Never!</unclear> but will Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack be as
                  faithful?"</p>
               <p>"They dare not be treacherous. Should they falsify an oath made to thee, my
                  counsellor, my heart's treasure, the insult should be avenged with my own right
                  arm."</p>
               <p>"'Tis well, Martin."</p>
               <p>"But tell me, my wife, why you manifest so ardent a desire to save those of our
                  enemy who have survived this night's bloody battle, when we have ourselves
                  suffered so severely? We have had a terrible enemy to cope with."</p>
               <p>"To save thee, Martin. Other reasons I have which you shall hear anon."</p>
               <p>"Prithee, tell me, what disposition do you propose to make of your charge?" asked
                  the chief.</p>
               <p>"Take them to Virginia Gorda, our lovely island home."</p>
               <p>"What then?"</p>
               <p>"There must they remain and dwell with us," she answered. "They cannot escape,
                  neither can they do us harm."</p>
               <p>"And will that dare-devil captain submit to such a fate?"</p>
               <p>"That is his only alternative."</p>
               <p>"And what of the four men?"</p>
               <p>"They must be prevailed upon to join the fleet. If they consent not, their fate is
                  in my hands—remember that, Martin."</p>
               <p>"I do, Haidee; I believe you are right; your wisdom is our chart, our compass; and
                  more than once has led us clear of shoals and quicksands to a port of safety."</p>
               <p>"Now, my husband, it is my will that you order Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack, with
                  their men, to repair to their own vessels forthwith. Plunder enough has already
                  been secured. This done, have the Thunderbolt's barge prepared for the reception
                  of the lady and child, and see that it is manned by your own most trustworthy
                  men."</p>
               <p>"It shall be done," said the chief, and he set about obeying the behests of that
                  strange woman, who alone had power to control his daring spirit.</p>
               <p>The necessary preparations having been made, the mother and child were removed to
                  the barge, followed by the brave Captain of the Admiral, who with great reluctance
                  left the ship. The thought had more than once flashed across his mind that it were
                  better to die upon his own deck, than to make any terms with a desperate band of
                  sea robbers; but the sight of Bertine's wife and child caused his better judgement
                  to prevail; it occurred to him that it yet might be in his power to do service for
                  the helpless ones. At least he might avenge any harm or insult that was offered
                  her; therefore he determined to remain by her to the last in weal or in woe.</p>
               <p>Tears trickled down the ruddy, weather-beaten cheek of that heroic mariner, as the
                  barge was rowed away from the doomed vessel; and after he had been transferred to
                  the piratical craft, he gazed with sorrow upon his own ship as she gradually
                  settled into the water, and finally disappeared beneath the surface of the
                  ocean.</p>
               <p>Morning came apace; the majestic orb of day arose from the sea in unclouded
                  splendor; a six knot breeze was now blowing from the southwest, which waited the
                  three buccaneering vessels toward their place of destination, Virginia Gorda.</p>
               <p>Nothing occurred during the first day of the voyage, but on the morning of the
                  second, just as Old Sol arose from his golden bed, the look-out, stationed at the
                  mast-head of the brigantine, descried a sail off the lee-bow. He reported to the
                  officer of the deck, who immediately signalized to the Raven and Shark the
                  discovery, and in a few moments these two vessels were coming down under a full
                  press of canvas.</p>
               <p>Red Martin now appeared on the Thunderbolt's deck, and ordered every sail to be
                  set. The three vessels sailed in a line, and looked like three snow-white clouds
                  gliding over the blue billow.</p>
               <p>"What do you make her out?" sang out the chief to the man at the mast-head."</p>
               <p>"She looks like a Spanish galleon!" answered the lookout.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6945-00000011"/>
               <p>"Fortune be praised, if that fellow is not mistaken!" said Red Martin to Antoine
                  Davila, a young Spaniard, now acting as first lieutenant. "Now if that sail should
                  turn out to be the Fernando of Lisbon, from Portobello, Antoine, she's a prize
                  worth capturing."</p>
               <p>"How know you that, Captain?" asked the lieutenant. "I've seen many a galleon
                  arrive at Lisbon, with not a maravedi's value worth our taking."</p>
               <p>"Ah, but I learned when in Panama, some months since, that the Fernando was
                  expected to arrive at Portobello, to transport to Spain a large amount of treasure
                  belonging to the Spanish government."</p>
               <p>"Then depend upon it, we shall have to fight desperately for her," replied Davila;
                  "the Spanish monarch ventures not the crown's treasure in lightly armed
                  ships."</p>
               <p>"True, very true," said the chief, "but were she the heaviest line-of-battle-ship
                  in the Spanish navy, instead of a clumsy galleon, I'd give her battle; and are we
                  not three to one? Galleons are dull sailers, and easily out-manœuvred. Rest
                  assured, if she is, as I suspect, the Fernando, she will be our prize before
                  sunset!"</p>
               <p>"I apprehend we shall find her too heavily manned for us," suggested Davila.</p>
               <p>"Antoine, if I had not often seen your lion spirit put to the <unclear>test,
                     I</unclear> should accuse you of cowardice. The Fernando, if it is she,
                  probably carries one hundred and fifty men, and I think I have heard it said she
                  was pierced for eighteen guns; more than that number of heavy pieces she could not
                  well carry."</p>
               <p>"Her complement of men, then, we may safely calculate, nearly doubles our three
                  crews combined. You forget, chief, our immense loss in the recent conflict."</p>
               <p>"I remember well, Antoine," said the chief, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Besides, the crews of the Raven and the Shark are in a worse condition than our
                  own, if possible; the men are greatly fatigued, and hardly in spirits for
                  action."</p>
               <p>"Then will we devise some stratagem, for have her we must, if she's the craft I
                  take her for," said Red Martin, and then clapping his trumpet to his mouth, he
                  cried:</p>
               <p>"Mast head, ahoy!"</p>
               <p>"Hillo!"</p>
               <p>"What of the strange sail?"</p>
               <p>"A Galleon, sir!"</p>
               <p>"What's her course?"</p>
               <p>"Due north."</p>
               <p>"Are we gaining upon her?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir—very fast."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Davila," said Red Martin, turning to his lieutenant, "order sail to be
                  shortened throughout the fleet, so as to keep even pace with our intended
                  prize."</p>
               <p>Giving this and a few other commands to his young subordinate, the chief went
                  below to meditate upon the best mode of securing the prize he had determined to
                  risk all to gain.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>An Evening Scene on the Ocean.—Haidee's Superstition.—Preparation for attacking
                     the Spanish Galleon.—The Combat.—Bold Conduct of the Female Leader.—The Capture
                     and the Booty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NIGHT came, and as the shades of twilight deepened, the gentle breeze gradually
                  died away—a dead calm succeeded, and the unwieldy galleon, at two leagues'
                  distance, lay "like a painted ship upon a painted ocean." The moon the planets and
                  the stars shone out with undimmed lustre, while the vast ocean itself emitted a
                  phosphorescent light, the remarkable phenomena adding great brilliancy to the
                  scene. It was, indeed, a lovely night—too serene and beautiful for the commission
                  of the horrid barbarities contemplated by the chief of this formidable band of
                  ocean robbers.</p>
               <p>As Davila had suggested to Red Martin, the crews were in a bad state for coping
                  successfully with the well-armed and well-manned galleon; besides, the pirates',
                  ammunition had nearly become exhausted in the action with the Admiral; and each of
                  the vessels, more particularly the case with the Raven and Shark, were
                  considerably crippled in their armament. But Red Martin, despite all obstacles,
                  determined on the rich prize; that obtained, it would serve his ambitious purposes
                  for years; and what cared he then about the great loss of life that must ensue in
                  the fight, providing he came off the victor; the more killed, the fewer shares to
                  divide, and the greater would be the lion's share of the golden spoils.</p>
               <p>The calm which prevailed was unfortunate for the pirates, inasmuch as it would
                  fatigue the men to pull at the oars for several hours at least; but,
                  notwithstanding this, Red Martin ordered his boats to be lowered and manned, and
                  signalled to Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack to do likewise. This done, he repaired to
                  his luxuriously-furnished state-room, to hold converse with his proud, ambitious
                  and courageous lady.</p>
               <p>"How fare your prisoner guests?" asked Red Martin, seating himself on a sumptuous
                  couch, beside his noble, his beautiful Haidee.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6945-00000012"/>
               <p>"The mother sleeps, and the sweet child, with its angel eyes open, nestles quietly
                  on her bosom. Ah, Martin, would that I could call that blessed babe mine!"</p>
               <p>"'Tis yours, Haidee, if it be your will and pleasure."</p>
               <p>"Think you, Martin, that I have the in human heart to tear it from its beautiful
                  mother's arms? No, to save my own life, a piratess though I am called, I could not
                  be guilty of such an act. Yet, I confess I envy the mother of that child."</p>
               <p>"Haidee, make not yourself unhappy on that account; our union may yet be
                  blessed."</p>
               <p>"Impossible."</p>
               <p>"Why impossible?"</p>
               <p>"You forget that the fortune-teller of my own dear native village, when I was but
                  a simple maid predicted that I should ever be childless. This I told you before
                  our nuptials were celebrated."</p>
               <p>"Superstitious nonsense! I marvel, Haidee, that a great soul like thine should
                  heed the babblings of a fortune-teller!"</p>
               <p>"Marvel not, my husband," said Haidee, seriously; "did she not foretell, ere I set
                  eyes on your face, that I should elope from my father's house with an outlawed
                  lover? Was not that prediction fulfilled?"</p>
               <p>"A matter of chance, simply; there are many outlaws, as they are termed, in the
                  world, and such a thing might happen many times in a year."</p>
               <p>"Did she not predict that my husband would become a pirate? Has not that, too,
                  come to pass?"</p>
               <p>"The circumstance is remarkable, I admit, but——"</p>
               <p>"And did she not prophecy that you would become the commander of a buccaneer
                  fleet?"</p>
               <p>"The old beldame made a lucky guess that time, truly."</p>
               <p>"And did she not predict truly when she said——"</p>
               <p>"No more of that old woman's nonsense, Haidee," interrupted Red Martin. "Let's
                  talk of the future. If we are fortunate enough to make a prize of that
                  richly-freighted galleon, our fortunes are made. We can then set sail for that for
                  off isle, which I have so often described to you; where power awaits us; where
                  luxuries, pleasures, and every desire of our natures will be within our reach.
                  Once safely there, we shall no longer be leagued with desperadoes, and subject to
                  the mercy of the tyrannical laws of European and American nations. There we can
                  abide in peace and plenty, and be happy."</p>
               <p>"Such a much wished for fate, for Haidee, was not predicted by the
                  fortune-teller!"</p>
               <p>"Damn the fortune-teller!" exclaimed Red Martin, indignantly. Do not, Haidee, if
                  you love me, prate more of her!"</p>
               <p>"It is because, Martin, you, as well as myself, have faith in her prediction, that
                  you wish my silence on the subject."</p>
               <p>"By h—! I have not!" he exclaimed, with increased ire. "You wrong me in the
                  accusation."</p>
               <p>"Your anger, Martin, proves that I speak truly. I know your nature better far than
                  you know yourself. You are extremely sensitive whenever I touch upon this matter
                  of prophecy."</p>
               <p>"Then, Haidee, I conjure you to beware trifling with what you deem a weakness. I
                  beseech you say no more regarding those damned mysterious hags, who prowl about
                  making accursed pretensions of power to foretell events, but who, in fact, can see
                  no farther into the dark vista of the future than ordinary mortals. For sixpence,
                  they will send your soul to hell or to heaven, as it may suit their pleasure. I
                  would speak of the galleon, and for that purpose I have left my post on deck. I
                  would have your counsel, Haidee. You are aware of the condition of our vessels and
                  crews."</p>
               <p>"Is she the vessel you supposed?"</p>
               <p>"Without doubt, she is the Fernando," answered Red Martin. "The man aloft knows
                  her well, and reports as I believe."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain that her treasures belong to the Spanish government?"</p>
               <p>"From the information I gained at Panama, I have no reason to question it."</p>
               <p>"Then give her battle, and trust to consequences," said the courageous woman. "Far
                  more humane and respectable is it to plunder governments than private individuals.
                  But, Martin let us not act the part of demons; let not more blood be shed than is
                  absolutely necessary to gain the victory! Better far is it that the survivors tell
                  the world of Red Martin's prowess than that we should make butchers of ourselves.
                  The world cannot do us harm, if we are so soon to repair to the island paradise
                  you have so glowingly pictured to my imagination."</p>
               <p>"It shall be as Haidee commands," said the chief, rising to go on deck. "I will
                  forthwith signalize to the Shark to begin the attack."</p>
               <p>"No, Martin, lose not an iota of that confidence which all the men repose in you.
                  The Thunderbolt is in better condition for action than either of the two vessels.
                  Begin the battle yourself if you would make victory doubly sure. I will be with
                  you in the heat of the conflict, to inspire the men with courage!"</p>
               <p>"Risk not your life on deck, Haidee," said the chief. "I apprehend a severe, a
                  bloody contest."</p>
               <p>"Then is there more necessity for my presence. I shall be well armed, and be
                  assured I will be in the thickest of the fray for it was not predicted that my
                  husband should fall in bat—"</p>
               <p>"Curse all predictions!" exclaimed Red Martin, cutting short Haidee's speech, and
                  hurriedly making his way to the deck.</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6945-00000013"/>
               <p>The boats' crews had now towed the Thunderbolt towards the galleon, within the
                  reach of her longest guns.</p>
               <p>"Now, boys, for a golden prize!" said the chief, addressing his men; "I have
                  almost positive knowledge that that vessel contains untold treasures. She is
                  stoutly manned, and her armament is heavy and complete, but it is in our power to
                  take her if we fight like men—like devils!"</p>
               <p>Three hearty cheers followed this announcement.</p>
               <p>"We must quickly test her capabilities!" resumed Red Martin. "Every man now to his
                  station—double shot every gun, that our first broadside may tell. Square all the
                  yards—have the catfall overhauled—man the capstan bars—out with your
                  tompions—stand by, and be ready for the word!"</p>
               <p>These and a number of other nautical evolutions were ordered, and the men set
                  about their duty with a zeal and alacrity which they seldom displayed. Their
                  incentive was the floating mine of wealth before them.</p>
               <p>The pirates were soon in readiness for action. The double missiles were rammed
                  into every gun; and each man on that deck gazed almost breathless upon their
                  chief, to hear his first command. He passed along both sides of the deck to see
                  that all was in readiness for action.</p>
               <p>"Aim high, gunners!" he continued. "We must not get a shot between wind and water;
                  we can't afford to sink such a prize. Let the shot tell on her spar-deck! That's
                  the way, my lads, to cripple her!"</p>
               <p>The brigantine was on the starboard quarter of the galleon, and with a night-glass
                  Red Martin perceived that there was a large body of men on her upper deck, and
                  that all was clear for action, in anticipation of an attack. He saw, too, that the
                  matches were lighted, awaiting the word. Red Martin quickly assumed his post.</p>
               <p>"A broadside, my boys! Be ready! Fire!" he shouted.</p>
               <p>Instantly, every larboard gun of the pirate bellowed in reply. Streaks of livid
                  fire, like so many streams of electric fluid, darted forth, sending missiles of
                  death and destruction to the decks of the galleon.</p>
               <p>"Hard starboard!" cried Red Martin to the man at the tiller.</p>
               <p>The helmsman promptly obeyed, but before the brigantine could show her starboard
                  battery to the galleon, a heavy broadside was returned. Most of the shot fell
                  short, and did no material damage, while the broadside of the Thunderbolt sent
                  terror and dismay to the defenders of the galleon. The taffrail of her high
                  quarter deck was completely carried away, presenting to the eye of the chieftain a
                  view of the entire deck of the unwieldy vessel.</p>
               <p>"Stand ready for another broadside, my brave lads! wait for the word!" cried Red
                  Martin.</p>
               <p>"Shall I down with that main-top, captain?" said an old gunner, leaving his piece
                  for a moment. "You see it's full of musketeers, and when we get within reach of
                  their muskets, they'll pepper us, as if we were so many wharf rats."</p>
               <p>"Do it, Gaspardo, and by St. Paul, we'll drink together the first bottle of the
                  galleon's best wine."</p>
               <p>The old pirate touched his hat and resumed his place at a long eighteen pounder,
                  stationed just abaft the cat-head.</p>
               <p>"Fire!" bellowed the captain through his trumpet.</p>
               <p>The response of the starboard battery was equally terrific and much more effective
                  than the larboard; for when the smoke cleared away, the galleon's main-top-mast
                  hung by some loose rigging, the cap of the mainmast was shattered, and not a live
                  man was left upon it!</p>
               <p>"Bravo! bravo! Three huzzas for Gaspardo!" shouted Red Martin.</p>
               <p>The pirates yelled like so many savages at the great feat of the old gunner.</p>
               <p>More than half of the guns on board of the galleon were silenced after this last
                  broadside still she kept blazing away with those in working order, aiming at the
                  Thunderbolt and the Shark, which latter had now come into the action a short
                  distance astern, and had brought one of her batteries to bear upon the high
                  quarter of the ship. The first broadside razeed it in a manner that allowed
                  Scarlet Jack a view of her upper deck from stem to stern.</p>
               <p>The battle with cannon continued but a few moments longer, for the pirates had
                  effectually silenced every gun aboard the galleon; and now her crew were making
                  every preparation to repel the pirates should they attempt to board, at the same
                  time Red Martin's voice was heard, ordering every man to prepare for boarding.</p>
               <p>A light breeze had sprung up, and wafted the brigantine slowly down upon the
                  doomed vessel. As she neared, the chief hailed her through his trumpet:</p>
               <p>"Fernando ahoy!"</p>
               <p>No answer was heard from the galleon, but a musket shot was discharged as if in
                  defiance.</p>
               <p>"Surrender! or, by Heaven, quarter shall not be given to a man of you!" demanded
                  the chief.</p>
               <p>"To whom?" cried an officer from the galleon's deck.</p>
               <p>"To the devil!" responded Red Martin, and he ordered down the flag of the fleet,
                  and in its place was immediately flying the bloody ensign of the pirates.</p>
               <p>At this moment a new commander appeared on the deck of the Thunderbolt. It was
                  Haidee, the Fearless! She had doffed her feminine apparel, and now appeared in a
                  complete French naval uniform, armed with a sabre and a brace of pistols.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6945-00000014"/>
               <p>Three hearty cheers welcomed the pirate's wife, her who had come on deck to lead
                  the boarding party in the attack; for seldom was it that this brave woman donned
                  her male attire for the conflict; but whenever she did so, the buccaneer crew felt
                  certain of a victorious result.</p>
               <p>As soon as the brigantine had ranged within pistol shot of the galleon, a volley
                  of small shot was poured into her; the damage in consequence was trifling, for
                  every pirate had, in obedience to Haidee's orders, crouched himself beneath the
                  bulwarks, with boarding-pike and cutlass ready in hand to follow her. wherever she
                  might lead, or go wither she might order. Volley after volley was fired by the
                  Spanish crew, yet the buccaneers sustained each volley well; they had learned a
                  dear lesson from the heroic Captain Stark, and now they profited by it.</p>
               <p>"Follow, my brave men!" cried Haidee, as the brigantine's larboard bows touched
                  the galleon's side.</p>
               <p>She seized a rope, which hung at the ship's side, drew herself up, and was the
                  first person that stood upon the enemy's railing. Here she encountered a Spaniard,
                  armed with a heavy broadsword; but her superior skill with a much lighter weapon,
                  wrenched it from his hand, and in a moment more he lay bleeding upon the deck. She
                  took her station upon a heavy piece of ordnance, wielding her cutlass with deadly
                  effect upon all who had the temerity to come within its reach, and directing the
                  battle at the same time. The Thunderbolt's crew, as well as several boat loads
                  from the Raven and Shark, boarded almost simultaneously, and a general combat with
                  sabres, cutlasses and pistols ensued. The voice of Haidee, commingled with the
                  reports of pistols, clashing of steel, oaths, curses and groans, was heard,
                  inspiring the crew with renewed courage: Red Martin stood near the gun, on which
                  Haidee had taken her position, and with wary eye he watched each stroke directed
                  towards her person, and in guarding the simultaneous onslaught of three of the
                  enemy upon his brave wife, he received a severe cutlass blow which felled him
                  almost senseless to the deck. He who dealt the blow paid dearly for his temerity,
                  for Haidee drew a pistol and sent a ball whizzing to his heart.</p>
               <p>She then engaged a sturdy, heroic-looking Spaniard, who handled a formidable blade
                  with consummate skill, and with it had already laid low nearly half a score of the
                  buccaneer crew. He was an old Castilian, and in a hundred single combats had never
                  been defeated. The pirate's wife parried his heavy blows with all her skill; but
                  soon found that she had met a foe more that her equal. He drew up his powerful
                  weapon with the intention of cleaving her skull; but it only served to knock the
                  cap from the head without inflicting the least injury, yet exposing ing her
                  beautiful tresses of black, glossy hair which now fell over her shoulders! The
                  Spaniard raised his steel to strike a surer blow, but his arm fell as if he had
                  been panic-stricken!</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Dios de Cielo! un muger!</foreign>—God of Heaven! a
                  woman!" was the exclamation of the astounded Castilian. "God forbid that I should
                  ever be the death of a woman!"</p>
               <p>As he stood thus wonder-stricken, with his sabre hanging by his side, one of the
                  pirates, who stood behind her, made an attempt to run him through with a
                  boarding-pike, and would have succeeded, had not Haidee, quick as thought, struck
                  the weapon aside, and dealt the pirate a blow which killed him on the instant.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Muchas gracias!</foreign>" exclaimed the old Castilian,
                  scarcely knowing how to account for such strange conduct.</p>
               <p>"Let not a hair of that noble old man's head be harmed!" commanded Haidee, as she
                  leaped from the gun to the deck. The victory was now won, and the rich prize in
                  undisputed possession of the buccaneers.</p>
               <p>There were no barbarities committed upon the persons of the few surviving
                  Spaniards, for such was the Amazonian woman's order. They were all disarmed, and
                  ordered into the hold, with the exception of the old Castilian. The hatches were
                  then fastened down, and the pirates set about searching the cabin and state-rooms,
                  where the most valuable portion of the treasures was supposed to be deposited.</p>
               <p>In their researches, the wealth discovered far exceeded Red Martin's most sanguine
                  expectations. There were chests of coined gold and silver, bars and ingots of the
                  same precious metals, boxes of gold-dust and pouches of quicksilver, together with
                  several caskets of jewels, including diamonds, pearls, rubies and opals, of
                  immense value.</p>
               <p>These were all transferred to the Thunderbolt; the Spaniards were then released
                  from the hold, to continue, without further molestation, their homeward voyage.
                  The pirates left the plundered galleon, repaired to their respective vessels, and
                  in the happiest mood possible, once more set sail for the island of their
                  destination.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Midnight.—Red Martin's proposition.—Haidee's Reply.—A Conspiracy concocting on
                     board the Raven.—The Cheat of Blackbeard to obtain command of the Fleet.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE hour of midnight had passed, when the piratical fleet was under weigh, and
                  parted from the galleon, which they had plundered of every portable article of
                  value the pirates could lay their ruthless hands upon. The deck of the Thunderbolt
                  was fairly encumbered with the rich spoils, originally intended to enrich Old
                  Spain's well nigh drained treasury. Red Martin stood on the deck superintending
                  the stowage of the valuables, while most of his crew, overcome with the fatigues
                  of the conflict, were snugly stowed in their hammocks below, and quietly reposing,
                  as if their blades had never been dyed in human gore.</p>
               <p>When all was safely beneath the hatches, the residue of the crew with the
                  exception of the man at the wheel, and the lookout, were ordered below by Red
                  Martin, who stood at the gangway, apparently meditating upon some newly conceived
                  idea, while he gazed into the rippling water, as his gallant vessel glided
                  smoothly onward toward its destined haven.</p>
               <p>Presently, with light step, a female figure arrayed in loosely flowing robes,
                  issued from the companion way. It was Haidee.</p>
               <p>"What keeps my husband so late from his couch?" she asked. "The night is bright
                  and beautiful, and no indications of a storm; the ocean is wide, and our vessel is
                  fleet—there are no dangers to apprehend. Come, Martin, let's retire; a couch of
                  luxury, after the fatigues of the night, should invite us to repose."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Haidee, so it would seem," answered the chief; "but sleep I cannot; my mind
                  is busy with a project, great and glorious."</p>
               <p>"Let Haidee share your thoughts."</p>
               <p>"I was thinking, my love, of that new home I have so often described to you."</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"I am sick of this buccaneering life; and now that there is sufficient wealth
                  within my grasp, gladly would I emancipate myself from the fleet which by a bloody
                  oath I am bound for another year to command!"</p>
               <p>"That oath was conditional, and made only to Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack."</p>
               <p>"True, Haidee; but how can I be absolved from it? as yet they have conformed to
                  those conditions. Could I but once catch them on the hip, I'd abandon them at
                  once."</p>
               <p>"Then bide your time, Martin, for that oath was a fearful one."</p>
               <p>"But, Haidee, consider what a mine of wealth now lies beneath these hatches?" said
                  he, with a significant expression. "Within three days after our arrival at
                  Virginia Gorda, that treasure will be divided, and but a sixth of it will be
                  ours."</p>
               <p>"A sixth will amount to no inconsiderable sum," replied the wife.</p>
               <p>"I would have it all, Haidee!" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"That is impossible!"</p>
               <p>"Not so; despite the oath, I am strongly tempted to watch the opportunity to
                  escape with vessel and treasure, from the fleet!"</p>
               <p>"Martin!" said Haidee, sternly; "did I think you had a heart to be so treacherous
                  to those, with whom you are leagued, woman though I am, I'd have the will to
                  strike a dagger hilt-deep into your faithless bosom!"</p>
               <p>"They are but wretches, all, and had the least treasonously inclined among them
                  such a golden opportunity as I have, they'd not be long, rest assured, in availing
                  themselves of it!"</p>
               <p>"Then let me conjure you not to render yourself the equal of those whom you deem
                  wretches! Corsair though you are, keep your solemn vow! maintain a little
                  nobleness on soul! cling to one human trait, that will enable you ever to say, I
                  am a man!"</p>
               <p>Red Martin gazed upon his wife with wonder and admiration, though he hoped that
                  she would applaud and not condemn the traitorous project he would have carried
                  into execution; but to attempt to do it, independent of her potent will, he dared
                  not.</p>
               <p>"You are right, Haidee—we'll think no more of it—let's below," said the chief; and
                  after summoning on deck the officer of the watch, he repaired to his state-room,
                  followed by his wife.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile this interview was going on, there was treason hatching on board of the
                  Raven. In the luxuriously furnished cabin of the second vessel of the pirate fleet
                  seated around a table, on which had been prepared a sumptuous repast, were<pb
                     n="32-33 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6945-00000016"/> Blackbeard, Scarlet Jack,
                  and the lieutenant of the former, Vasco San Malo, a Mexican by birth. The
                  commander of the Shark had been invited on board of the Raven by Blackbeard,
                  ostensibly for the purpose of drinking a bottle of wine with him, but actually to
                  broach to him a subject which had for some time been brooding in the pirate's
                  mind, and in which he desired to enlist the interest and co-operation of the
                  youngest commander of the fleet, as he had already secured those of his
                  lieutenant, San Malo.</p>
               <p>"Curse that damned she-freebooter!" exclaimed Blackbeard, in continuation of the
                  topic on which they had been conversing.—"She is our chief, and not Red Martin,
                  whom she rules with easy sway; she has more than once caused him to act like a
                  fool and a coward! If our necks are ever stretched by a halter, we may thank this
                  woman's clemency for it!"</p>
               <p>"Sacre!" exclaimed the Mexican, clutching the hilt of a poniard, and grinding his
                  teeth; "I'd like to have her heart's blood!"</p>
               <p>"Still, comrades, she is a brave woman," said Scarlet Jack; "and I admire her for
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Bravery in a corsair is no merit, when the possessor extends mercy to a foe,"
                  said Blackbeard; "what has a pirate to do with mercy? does he not know that if he
                  is ever captured, no merciful eye will look upon him? The pirate must die—aye, and
                  ignominiously too—he must swing on a scaffold—or be gibbeted in chains, as was the
                  great master-spirit of our profession! In my opinion, he who is most to be
                  applauded by buccaneers, is the man who conquers that silly weakness, mercy, and
                  in cold blood, with a steady arm, can butcher and hack in pieces his captured
                  enemy, and smile while he does it! Oh! for the good, <unclear>old</unclear> days
                  of the great Kidd, when every living thing on board a captured vessel was made to
                  walk the plank! when free-rovers adopted and acted upon the truism, that "dead men
                  tell no tales!"</p>
               <p>"Bravo! bravo!" shouted the Mexican cut-throat.</p>
               <p>"Who knows that the whole Spanish navy will not be dogging us at our very heels in
                  less than three days?" ejaculated. Blackbeard. "If so, would not Red Martin's
                  she-devil deserve to dangle at the fore-yard-arm, for her interference in sparing
                  a half score of Spaniards to blow us to the world?"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, Blackbeard!" exclaimed Scarlet Jack; "the government of Spain could not,
                  if it would, spare a single gun-boat from its crippled navy, especially while she
                  is at war with a superior power."</p>
               <p>"It matters not," replied Blackbeard; "had they been Englishmen or Frenchmen, our
                  petticoat chief would have spared them."</p>

               <p>"Si, captain; and Red Martin would not have dared to say nay," said San Malo.</p>
               <p>"Her power over the chief is, indeed, wonderful," remarked Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"And it is now high time that that power should be destroyed!" added Blackbeard.
                  "I'd be a mine slave rather than be domineered over by any woman that lives!"</p>
               <p>"Talk not so loud," whispered Scarlet Jack. "Some of your crew may overhear
                  us."</p>
               <p>"There's not a man of my crew, but understands the whole project," said
                  Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"Indeed?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, indeed! and not one of them all is there, who is not ready and willing, at a
                  moment's warning, to free themselves from this petty tyranny. We only wait your
                  cooperation, captain. Be assured there are matters, of which I suspect Red Martin,
                  that you little dream of."</p>
               <p>"Suspect our chief!—of what?" ejaculated Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Of robbing us!"</p>
               <p>"You slander him!"</p>
               <p>"Nay not so—hear me," said Blackbeard, "and be your own judge. Did you not mark
                  with what care he commanded all the treasures of the galleon to be removed to the
                  Thunderbolt?"</p>
               <p>"I did.'</p>
               <p>"And when San Malo ordered a single box of dust to the Raven's deck, did he not
                  countermand the order, and had it forthwith conveyed to the brigantine?"</p>
               <p>"It was so," replied Scarlet Jack; "but it did not occur to me that it would not
                  be as safe under his hatches as ours."</p>
               <p>"Would it not be equally safe under your care or mine?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly."</p>
               <p>"And why is this?" interrogated Blackbeard. "He either mistrusts our honesty, and
                  that it is our intention to conceal treasure which belongs to all, or we are
                  constrained to believe that he intends to appropriate it to himself. If we view it
                  in the former light, it is a gross and unpardonable insult to us. If in the
                  latter, he would cheat us; therefore, he deserves condemnation!"</p>
               <p>"By heaven! I thought not of this before!" exclaimed his compeer. "But he is bound
                  by a fearful oath to deal justly by every man of the fleet!"</p>
               <p>"Humph!—his oath!" said Blackbeard, sneeringly. "A keg of dollars would induce him
                  to break it! Ay, a word from Haidee, his bold wench, would make him falsify
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"Think you so contemptously of him?" asked Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"By Pluto, I do; and I hope to have the opportunity, ere long, to tell him so to
                  his teeth!"</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6945-00000018"/>
               <p>"Then is it high time to intrust the command of the fleet to more honest hands!"
                  declared Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Spoken like a bravo!" exclaimed Blackbeard. "Give us your hand—we'll drink to
                  your opinion. Here, Mungo," said he to an Ethiopian slave, belonging to Red
                  Martin, who was in attendance, "open a bottle of that fine old port—fill up the
                  goblets to the brim."</p>
               <p>The slave promptly obeyed his temporary master, and each of the trio held in his
                  hand a goblet of the deep scarlet, delicious beverage.</p>
               <p>"Here's to the brave, the noble commander of the Shark!" said Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>Scarlet Jack responded to the toast, and gave his full adhesion to the conspiracy
                  thus formed against their chief.</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen," said Blackbeard, rising, "fill up again, and I'll give you a
                  toast, which, if ye have the heart and courage to drink, a glorious consummation
                  of our wishes will surely ensue."</p>
               <p>"The toast—the toast!" cried both of his interlocutors.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said Blackbeard:—"Here's death to Red Martin!—death to that
                  she-devil, Haidee!—and an equitable division of all plunder!"</p>
               <p>His comrades arose, repeated the toast, and drank the contents of the goblets at a
                  toss.</p>
               <p>"Fill again!" said Blackbeard; "here's to the future commander of the
                  Thunderbolt—Scarlet Jack!"</p>
               <p>"One glass more," added Scarlet Jack; "I propose San Malo to the command of the
                  Shark!"</p>
               <p>"Well said," responded Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"And I," said San Malo, "propose Blackbeard for our chief!"</p>
               <p>"Agreed!" said Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said Blackbeard, "I cannot thus assume the command; but on three
                  throws of the dice by each of us, I propose that the chief command of the fleet
                  shall be decided."</p>
               <p>"I am unwilling to take so responsible a post," said the lieutenant; "the height
                  of my ambition has already been proposed to me—I waive all claim to the post of
                  chief so long as there are abler hands in the fleet."</p>
               <p>"Then the game lies between you and me," said Blackbeard to his compeer. "Ho,
                  Mungo—the dice—the dice!"</p>
               <p>They were quickly placed before them by the alert negro. The captain of the Shark
                  threw first and counted seventeen, sixteen, nine forty-two in all!</p>
               <p>"It is almost useless for me to throw against that count," said Blackbeard.
                  "Forty-two is high—the chances are more than five to one against me."</p>
               <p>While he spoke, however, the dextrously managed to change the dice, unperceived by
                  any except the quick eyes of Mungo. At the first throw he counted seventeen—at the
                  second thirteen—and at the third, up came three sixes!"</p>
               <p>"Forty-eight, by Jupiter!" exclaimed the winner.</p>
               <p>"A lucky throw," remarked San Malo.</p>
               <p>"I am content," said Scarlet Jack. "The command, by right of seniority, was yours;
                  and now it is doubly yours."</p>
               <p>"I accept it, and may I prove worthy the great trust," said Blackbeard. "One thing
                  is certain, comrades;—so long as there's life in me, I'll be a true pirate! But
                  we're counting the game before we have had a fair shot at it."</p>
               <p>"What's to be done?" asked Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Board the Thunderbolt when all but the deck-watch are below—massacre all who dare
                  offer the least resistance—spare only those who will swear allegiance to us!"</p>
               <p>"What disposition shall be made of that bold Yankee captain—the prisoner-guest of
                  Red Martin's wife?"</p>
               <p>"Cut him down at once!"</p>
               <p>"What with the woman, child and servant?" interrogated Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Butcher them all, and give their bodies to the sharks!"</p>
               <p>"Shall we not spare the beautiful quadroon, called Sybil?" asked San Malo.</p>
               <p>"No, by Pluto, not one of the Thunderbolt's prisoners!" answered the wretch,
                  Blackbeard. "The four sailors on board of my vessel, having nearly consented to
                  join us, shall not be harmed. One of them—a fellow of undaunted mettle—I take
                  quite an interest in. He is capable of making a capital officer. If I can only
                  work a weakness out of him, which he calls a conscience, then are we sure of
                  him."</p>
               <p>"When shall we carry into execution our plans?" asked Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"The first gloomy night," replied Blackbeard; "the barometer is sinking low, and I
                  have perceived to-night other indications of a rain-storm within forty-eight
                  hours. To-night, let the work of preparation commence on both of our
                  vessels—secretly, lest our doings be watched, and our designs be suspected by some
                  of Red Martin's men. Let not our plans be developed even to our own crew until the
                  hour of action shall have arrived.—We'll have in the meantime another interview.
                  And now, gentlemen, as it is well nigh morning, suppose we turn in and get some
                  rest."</p>
               <p>"One word more before we separate," said Scarlet Jack. "This servant here is privy
                  to all our plans."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you never need fear Mungo," said Blackbeard.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6945-00000019"/>
               <p>"Golly, massa, no—neber fear tell Mungo ebery ting," interposed the slave, rolling
                  up the whites of his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Although he is one of Red Martin's bondmen, he hates his own master and mistress
                  as heartily as I do."</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa Blackbeard, it am a fac," declared Mungo.</p>
               <p>"At his own request, Red Martin allowed him to become my servant."</p>
               <p>"Why is this, Mungo?" interrogated Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Massa Martin, he beatee me; missee, she beatee me; and now Mungo would hab
                  rebenge."</p>
               <p>"What would you do, Mungo, providing you had a good opportunity?" asked
                  Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"Golly, massa, me would chop dar heads off wid this!" replied Mungo, displaying a
                  heavy hanger which he wore at his side.</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied; our secret is safe enough with him," remarked Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"If it were not, there's naught to fear," said Blackbeard. We'll have no
                  communication with the Thunderbolt's chief or crew. Besides, Mungo is no swimmer;
                  he has a horrid dread of wetting his skin, to say nothing of his fear of being
                  swallowed whole by a hungry shark."</p>
               <p>Scarlet Jack now arose and left his coadjutors of the conspiracy. Calling his
                  rowers, he entered his barge, and was quickly conveyed to the Shark, which vessel
                  at the time was within hailing distance of the Raven.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE subsequent night was a cloudy one; the moon and stars were obscured from the
                  earth, and early in the evening a thick veil of fog enveloped the ocean. The
                  breeze was light, and in consequence of the thick atmosphere, the three vessels
                  were ordered to keep within hailing distance, lest in the night they might
                  unintentionally part company. Eight bells were struck, when Blackbeard and his
                  first lieutenant. San Malo, embarked in the schooner's barge for an evening's
                  visit to Scarlet Jack, and to partake of an entertainment that had been prepared
                  for the occasion. Thus was Mungo, the slave, for that evening relieved from duty
                  in the cabin of the Raven.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the barge, containing the two conspirators, left the schooner's
                  larboard gangway, than Mungo dropped silently into the sea from the opposite side,
                  and like a dolphin—despite his apparently innocent declaration that he could not
                  swim—struck off in a bee line for the brigantine. The black object was visible,
                  but for a moment, by one of the watch, but thinking it some monstrosity of the
                  vasty deep, he took no further notice of it. By the time the Raven's barge had
                  reached the gangway of the Shark, the negro's head was seen rising above the
                  larboard cat-head of the Thunderbolt.</p>
               <p>"Who goes there?" ejaculated one of the watch, standing near, and at the same time
                  leveling his carbine.</p>
               <p>"Hus-s-h-h!" essayed the Ethiopian, in a loud whisper. "Don't shoot poor Mungo—me
                  do no harm," and leaping on deck, he whispered a single word in the ear of the
                  sentinel, and was permitted to pass aft. He met Red Martin, his rightful master,
                  in the companion way.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mungo! is that you?" ejaculated Red Martin.</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa—'tis Mungo!" replied the wet Ethiopian.</p>
               <p>"You look more like a drowned baboon, than a dark specimen of humanity!"</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6945-00000020"/>
               <p>"Ees, massa, I duz," he replied, his teeth chattering with the cool bath he had
                  taken.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mungo, what is your errand here?" interrogated the chief.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Massa, de bery debil hesef's broke loose!" he replied in an emphatic
                  whisper,—"Me come to tell you all 'bout' im, massa."</p>
               <p>"The devil you have?"</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa."</p>
               <p>"Then come below, Mungo," said Red Martin.</p>
               <p>The chief led the way, and the faithful Mungo, who by the way was one of Red
                  Martin's spies, was quickly ushered into the presence of Haidee; and there, in his
                  own peculiar vernacular, related to them every word he had heard touching the plot
                  to destroy his master and mistress.</p>
               <p>"What think you now, my wife, of my suspicions regarding these traitorous devils'
                  fealty to us?" ejaculated Red Martin, enraged at the vile plot formed against
                  him.</p>
               <p>"They have shown themselves monsters, and dearly must they pay for their treason!"
                  exclaimed Haidee.</p>
               <p>"By heaven! they shall not live!"</p>
               <p>"No Martin, they yet must live, solely for our purposes!" said the bold woman.
                  "Leave all to me; and though I appear lenient, in allowing them a short lease of
                  life, yet I will so work upon their minds that they shall ever after tremble at
                  the power of Haidee. My will shall be their law; and if I but make it known, these
                  slavish curs shall obey! Martin, we'll have a banquet to-morrow; these three
                  traitors shall be our chief guests. Then they shall be taught a lesson they little
                  wot of."</p>
               <p>"I comprehend, Haidee," replied Red Martin. "Your wisdom only is surpassed by an
                  indomitable courage. Do as seems to you best. I leave these damned villains to
                  your superior judgment."</p>
               <p>"Mungo," said Haidee, turning to their slave, "after our counterplot has
                  succeeded, demand of us your freedom; and you shall thereafter have for your own
                  use a steward's share of all our undivided plunder."</p>
               <p>"Tankee, missee," said Mungo.</p>
               <p>"Be vigilant—be active," she continued; "and conceal, if possible, your visit here
                  to-night. To-morrow, should you discover a crimson scarf flying from the mainsail
                  peak, contrive secretly to spike every gun aboard of the Raven. Here," she
                  resumed, after taking a package from a drawer, and placing it in Mungo's hand,
                  "are two dozen rat-tail files—force one into each cannon's vent with all the
                  strength of your hand, and then snap them off so as to let no stem remain above
                  the metal. Do you understand me?"</p>
               <p>"Ees, missee," answered Mungo, chuckling at the very idea of doing so much
                  mischief so easily.</p>
               <p>"Now go—be cautious. Should you be discovered in the water, contrive some
                  expedient to make them believe that you had fallen overboard!"</p>
               <p>"Ees, missee, Mungo make 'em beliebe ebery ting."</p>
               <p>"And should you discover that any demonstration is to be made against us sooner
                  than first contemplated, place this blue ribbon around your hat, and show yourself
                  in the main rigging."</p>
               <p>"Ees, missee."</p>
               <p>"Now, Mungo, good night."</p>
               <p>The negro took the hint, and bowed himself out of the cabin. Once more he quietly
                  slipped into the water by a loose piece of rigging, and darted through the water
                  with all the skill of a Triton. As he neared the stern of the Raven, he heard the
                  sound of oars, and supposing that Blackbeard's barge was returning, he swam with
                  all his might, and in doing so caused the water to plash about him. The man at the
                  wheel, discovering an unusual motion in the water, he cried out—</p>
               <p>"Lights! ho, lights here! Somebody must be overboard!"</p>
               <p>Mungo, hearing the cry, and comprehending the cause, began to utter most piteous
                  exclamations:—</p>
               <p>"Help! help! sabe poor Mungo! me will drown! a rope! a boat! for God's sake do
                  someting to sabe poor Mungo!"</p>
               <p>While he shouted, he imitated the gurgling sounds of a man drowning, and
                  floundered about as if making the most desperate efforts to save himself.</p>
               <p>A line was thrown towards him. Mungo had seized hold of it just as Blackbeard's
                  barge rounded the schooner's stern.</p>
               <p>"You damned nigger! what's all this yelling about? how came you here?" were the
                  first ejaculations of the boatswain.</p>
               <p>"Me—fall—overboard!" said Mungo, appearing almost exhausted.</p>
               <p>"Swim, you damned fool! why don't you swim?"</p>
               <p>"Me—no—swim, massa!—help—quick—shark—eatee poor Mungo!"</p>
               <p>"Do you imagine that a shark would be such a consummate fool, as to take into his
                  mouth such a sooty, greasy, unpalatable-looking morsel as you are?" said the
                  boatswain. "I have a great mind to sever the line and let you drift to kingdom
                  come."</p>
               <p>"Take him in, boatswain," said Blackbeard; "you've tormented him sufficiently to
                  pay for all your trouble."</p>
               <p>The men, after they had soused him three or four times, deep into the water,
                  hauled him aboard the boat, and finally took him to the deck of the schooner.</p>
               <p>"Now tell me, you thunder-cloud, how came you overboard!" demanded Blackbeard.</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6945-00000021"/>
               <p>"Me got fass sleep, mass, on de taffril, and me rolled off," said Mungo.</p>
               <p>"It's a pity you ever waked up again," said the boatswain.</p>
               <p>This invention of Mungo was sufficient to allay any suspicion in the mind of
                  Blackbeard, that he had uttered anything but the simple truth. He ordered him to
                  go and change his wet cloths for dry ones, and then to attend him in the
                  cabin.</p>
               <p>"Every thing goes as we could desire," said Blackbeard to San Malo, after they
                  were again seated in the cabin of the Raven. "Scarlet Jack and all his crew are as
                  ripe for the mischief as we are. We shall soon show this presumptuous, ambitious
                  chief, and his cunning she-devil, the power of our sway. Hell! I am impatient for
                  the coming of another night!"</p>
               <p>"And so am I!" said the lieutenant. "But, by St. Jago, I cannot dispel from my
                  mind some misgivings that that damned witch may yet circumvent our plans!"</p>
               <p>"There's blessed little fear of that," replied Blakbeard. "Our plot is so
                  perfectly formed, I can see no possible chance for counterplotting. As for Red
                  Martin's tigress, she is but mortal like the rest of us, and our crew will get
                  over their superstitious notions regarding her after they have the evidence of
                  their own senses that she is as vulnerable as the rest of us. But, if I knew,
                  lieutenant, she were the consort of Lucifer himself, and had all the power of hell
                  to back her, I would not recede from my purpose! The blow shall be struck!"</p>
               <p>"But, should we not succeed——"</p>
               <p>"We cannot help succeeding—if we do but our duty to each other. There's not a man
                  of the two schooners' crews, but what feels that our cause is his. That treasure
                  on board the Thunderbolt will not make them rest easy so long as it is in the
                  hands of Red Martin and his wife."</p>
               <p>"You are right," said San Malo; "in that idea lies the-chief element that will
                  ensure us success."</p>
               <p>"Well, lieutenant, I'm for hammock to-night; I'm getting drowsy; see that all is
                  right above, and hurry along Mungo to my state-room," said Blackbeard, as he arose
                  to retire.</p>
               <p>The night passed quietly, and the conspirators slept as soundly as if the
                  contemplated events of the night following were banished from their minds.</p>

               <p>BLACKBEARD'S prediction in regard to the near approach of a storm was not
                  verified; for with the first grey streaks of dawn, the mist which had veiled the
                  ocean gradually arose, and ere the King of Day, like an orb of molten gold,
                  appeared in full above the horizon, the whole expanse of heaven, to mortal ken,
                  was undimmed by a single cloud. It was, indeed, a lovely morning, and while nature
                  rejoiced at the smiling heavens, the inhuman buccaneer conspirators cursed that
                  the heavens did not frown.</p>
               <p>At eight bells, the chief of the conspirators and his lieutenant, simultaneously
                  appeared on the Raven's deck.</p>
               <p>"A pleasant morning, captain," saluted the lieutenant.</p>
               <p>"How can we call that pleasant which to us is hateful?" queried Blackbeard,
                  looking frowningly upon the azure sky. "A damned morning, say I!"</p>
               <p>"I merely alluded to the pleasantness of the weather," remarked San Malo.</p>
               <p>"To what else did I respond. I say, to us the morning is NOT pleasant!"</p>
               <p>"But the evidence is before you. See how brightly the sun——"</p>
               <p>"Curse the sun and his brightness!" interrupted Blackbeard. "To carry into
                  execution our great purpose, we want no sun. Rather let the whole ocean be covered
                  with thick black clouds! the rain descend in torrents! ay, let even the forked
                  lightning play in the murky vapor and the thunders roll than that we should have
                  been cursed with all this brightness! You forgot San Malo, if the night is
                  pleasant, we must forego executing our well-laid plan, and perhaps not another
                  opportunity, so fair, will again offer; for, before the rising of another sun, we
                  shall in all probability be safely moored in our inlet of Virginia Gorda!
                  Therefore, again I say, curse you shining light!"</p>
               <p>"Now, by St. Christopher, I have caught your meaning!" said the lieutenant.</p>

               <p>"Methinks you were dull not to comprehend me before."</p>
               <p>"You talked oddly."</p>
               <p>"Ay, but meaningly."</p>
               <p>"True; and I now can curse the sun with as good a heart as yourself," said San
                  Malo; "and if a prayer to Lucifer could be heard and answered, I'd pray for a
                  black mantle to hide the sky from now till noon-day!"</p>
               <p>"Bravo! spoken like a true pirate," said Blackbeard. "But how's this?" he
                  ejaculated, looking at the position of the Thunderbolt and the Shark. "Red Martin
                  has sailed ahead of us, and Scarlet Jack is far to leeward of him."</p>
               <p>"We are gaining on the Thunderbolt now," said the lieutenant; "for see, the
                  mainsail peak is dropped. The chief is shortening sail to allow us to come
                  up."</p>
               <p>"You're right—I see," said Blackbeard, looking through his glass. "I had a sudden,
                  though faint suspicion that the fellow was endeavoring to show us a clean pair of
                  heels. I shall be suspicious henceforth of every odd movement I discover in him,
                  his crew and his vessel."</p>
               <p>"They are now lowering the chief's barge, I perceive," remarked San Malo, after a
                  brief pause in the conversation. "I take it there's nothing odd in that?"</p>
               <p>"That's but an every day occurrence," was Blackboard's reply.</p>
               <p>"They have hauled it around to the gangway—and, now, two of his men and the
                  boatswain's boy are getting into it.</p>
               <p>"There's nothing odd in that, either," said Blackbeard; "perhaps Red Martin will
                  visit us."</p>
               <p>"No—the boat has shoved off with the men and the boy," resumed San Malo, "and it
                  is now heading for us."</p>
               <p>"Some dispatch, doubtless, from Red Martin. He will, I'm thinking, have but few
                  more to transmit to us; for, in spite of wind or weather, we must make the attempt
                  to-night!"</p>
               <p>"To night, then let it be," responded the lieutenant.</p>
               <p>The conversation continued a few minutes longer, when the chief's barge ran
                  alongside, and the boy spoken of, who served Red Martin in the capacity of
                  cabin-boy, came aboard and was met at the gangway by Blackboard, to whom he handed
                  a sealed a note.</p>
               <p>"Wait one moment, and, I will ascertain if an answer is to be returned," said the
                  conspirator; and turning upon his heel he rejoined the lieutenant on the
                  quarter-deck. "It looks like a love billet-doux, or an invitation to a wedding,"
                  he continued, breaking the seal. "It is scented, too—bah!"</p>
               <p>He ran his eye over the contents, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"By all that's savory, it is an invitation to dine on board of the Thunderbolt!
                  Read it."</p>
               <p>San Malo took the note. The contents were as follows:</p>

               <p>"By St. Iago, lieutenant, you are highly honored," said Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"What can the postscript mean?" asked San Malo.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is in regard to those four prisoners."</p>
               <p>"How know you that?"</p>
               <p>"I know it well, for he intimated as much to me the last time we spake together,"
                  replied Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"Yet I care not about acceding to his request, just on the eve of—"</p>
               <p>"Go, by all means, lieutenant. It is the very thing—for you may have an
                  opportunity to sound his men. If not, you can contrive secretly to spike a gun or
                  two at least."</p>
               <p>"Capital—I'll go, captain," said San Malo, decisively. "But you, too, will dine
                  with him?"</p>
               <p>"If I don't eat of that pig, I'll make a baked dish of Red Martin's head!—of that
                  be assured. I'll feast my appetite on his meats and his wines, and then I'll glut
                  my vengeance by hacking him limb from limb! Yes, lieutenant, go, and make answer
                  for me, with my compliments to himself and his mistress, that I shall be proud of
                  the honor, &amp;c.," said he, in sneering tones. "You understand me."</p>
               <p>"Ay; you will be prompt?"</p>
               <p>"You'll find me thus."</p>
               <p>"And act your part well, I doubt not—ha, ha, ha!"</p>
               <p>"I'll be damn'd if I don't!" said Blackbeard. "You'll see me grace the table with
                  all the politeness and suavity of a polished gentleman. I'll smile and say as many
                  pretty things as a jack-dandy. Haidee shall deem me a true ladies' man, while I
                  shall be devising the most genteel mode of cutting her throat!"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha! captain," laughed his subordinate; "you're in glorious spirits in
                  spite of your disappointment in funding a sunny instead of a stormy morning."</p>
               <p>"Ah! the very thoughts of that baked pig and the incidentals, makes me facetiously
                  disposed. Depend upon it, we'll have some rare sport."</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6945-00000023"/>
               <p>"Ay, that we will," said the lieutenant; "but I'll not keep the barge longer in
                  waiting; so, good morning, Senor capitan."</p>
               <p>"Good morning, lieutenant."</p>
               <p>San Malo, after buckling on his sabre belt, and providing himself with the weapons
                  he was accustomed to carry upon his person, took a seat in the barge, and after a
                  few moments was landed on the quarter deck of the Thunderbolt, where he was
                  received cordially by his chief.</p>
               <p>"My thanks, lieutenant, for your promptness in attending to my wishes," said Red
                  Martin; "indeed, your haste to serve me prevented my being ready for the matter on
                  which I wish to confer with you. In the course of half an hour, I shall be
                  prepared for you; meanwhile, amuse yourself by examining our armament. Antoine
                  Davila shall accompany you."</p>
               <p>"Thanks," said San Malo. "Nothing could make a half hour pass more
                  pleasantly."</p>
               <p>It was in fact just what the Mexican desired, with the exception of being
                  accompanied by the Thunderbolt's lieutenant, who he knew was as wary as he was
                  brave. However, he expressed not that he would prefer no companion, and accepted
                  his compeer's guidance. Davila was in the secret and well he knew his cue. He
                  escorted him to every part of the vessel, with the exception of the main cabin and
                  state-rooms. San Malo expressed an unusual interest in the brass guns upon the
                  deck, as well as every thing pertaining thereto; and while the back of Davils was
                  turned, he contrived to stop the vents of two guns of the starboard battery, by
                  adroitly inserting in each the small end of a rat-tail file, and breaking it
                  within the vent. They were now examining a long eighteen-pounder, and he was about
                  to put into temporary disuse this likewise; but Davila having suddenly turned his
                  eye upon him, detected him in the very act.</p>
               <p>"Ah! somebody has been endeavoring to spike this gun!" exclaimed San Malo, as he
                  now strove to extract, what he had a moment before inserted, in order to avoid the
                  suspicion of Davila.</p>
               <p>"Villain! what do you there?" demanded Davila.</p>
               <p>"Villain I am not!" exclaimed San Malo, seizing the handle of his sword.</p>
               <p>"I denounce you as a traitor!" said Davila. "I charge you with an attempt to spike
                  that gun!"</p>
               <p>"'Tis false as hell!" exclaimed San Malo, wrathfully.</p>
               <p>"'Tis true as heaven!" exclaimed a female voice behind him.</p>
               <p>The traitorous lieutenant turned, and beheld Haidee's majestic form standing
                  before him.</p>
               <p>"You, too, speak falsely!"</p>
               <p>"Liar!" returned Haidee. "I saw you do it! I knew your evil intent, and have
                  watched your every movement since you stepped upon this deck. Think'st, vile
                  traitor, you can deceive Haidee!—her who reads every thought of your hellish
                  brain? Ha, ha!—you would partake of our hospitality, and betray us into the
                  sanguinary hands of your chosen master!"</p>
               <p>San Malo shrunk back in amazement. He was powerless—he quailed and trembled before
                  the woman, who, he would have sworn, possessed more power than is usually given to
                  mortals.</p>
               <p>"Seize the audacious wretch!" she commanded.</p>
               <p>A dozen bold buccaneers with weapons drawn, leaped forward and obeyed her stern
                  bidding.</p>
               <p>"Bind him fast—below with him!" she continued. "Men, you all have evidence of his
                  treason—he would render our armament powerless. Look, here—these two guns were
                  spiked by his hand!" and she pointed to those, the vents of which he had stopped,
                  as he supposed, unobserved.</p>
               <p>"Shall we string him up to the fore-yard arm?" asked a veteran buccaneer.</p>
               <p>"No," she answered.</p>
               <p>"He deserves no less than an instantaneous death!"</p>
               <p>"Peace, Roy!" commanded Haidee. "The traitor has not long to live—of that be
                  assured—let my word content you!"</p>
               <p>"Long live our noble mistress!" shouted the pirates.</p>
               <p>"Thanks! Below with him!" commanded Haidee.</p>
               <p>"Mercy! mercy!" cried the wretched culprit.</p>
               <p>"You plead for mercy who have none?" she said, tauntingly. "You, who had foully
                  conspired against my life—against the life of your chosen chief—and against the
                  lives of many of this brave crew! Ha, ha! it becomes you not, aspiring San
                  Malo."</p>
               <p>"Oh, spare me—in mercy, spare me—and all shall be confessed!" prayed the merciless
                  wretch, sinking upon his knees.</p>
               <p>"What would or can you confess that I do not know?" ejaculated Haidee. "All
                  confession, when all is discovered, would be gratuitous. Already I know all—more
                  even than the knowledge you yourself possess; for had you succeeded in your
                  diabolical plot, your master would have sold his miserable tool, San Malo. No,
                  I'll hear no confession from your lips, for it will avail you nothing. Your life
                  is forfeited—doubly forfeited! I have known you long for an unscrupulous villain!
                  and villains so infamous deserve not to exist!"</p>
               <p>"Let me, I beseech you, reveal the whole plot!" again entreated San Malo.</p>
               <p>"Once more I tell you there is no occasion for it," replied<pb
                     n="48-49 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6945-00000024"/> Haidee. "You can only
                  relate to me that the Satanic Blackbeard, the ruthless Scarlet Jack, and the
                  unscrupulous San Malo, have formed a conspiracy to murder the greatest of those
                  with whom you are leagued by a solemn and a fearful oath; and that to night you
                  were to execute your fiendish purposes. Your master, Blackbeard, on a throw of the
                  dice, won the chieftainship of our band. Scarlet Jack was named as commander of
                  the Thunderbolt, while you were to be promoted to the command of the Shark. My
                  noble husband, myself, my prisoner guests, and all on board of this vessel who
                  should refuse to espouse your cause, were to be summarily and mercilessly
                  massacred! Can you deny this, wretch?"</p>
               <p>"It was so, I confess," said the conspirator, "but——"</p>
               <p>"I'll hear no more!" interrupted Haidee. "Drag him below! I cannot bear to gaze
                  longer upon so monstrous a lump of wretchedness. Here, boatswain, one word with
                  you," she continued, turning to that officer. She then whispered a few words in
                  his ear, unheard by any other person.</p>
               <p>"Your commands shall be promptly obeyed," was the boatswain's reply.</p>
               <p>The traitor, firmly pinioned, was now borne from the deck to a place below
                  designated by the boatswain.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AT two bells, precisely, on that eventful day, the Raven's barge was seen coming
                  towards the Thunderbolt, and in a few minutes came alongside, as also did the
                  barge of the Shark; and, almost simultaneously, Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack,
                  arrayed in full uniform, were met at the gangway by Red Martin, who had also taken
                  more than ordinary care to deck himself in the trappings of his high position.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen—welcome!" said Red Martin; "it gives me unusual joy to be honored by
                  your company on this occasion. The day is an auspicious one, and betokens that we
                  shall have a merry time of it."</p>
               <p>"I doubt not we shall," replied Blackbeard, giving Scarlet Jack a significant
                  wink; "and we thank you for our welcome."</p>
               <p>"Our banquet is well nigh ready," said Red Martin. "I have a rare delicacy to
                  tickle your palates with."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that pig, taken among the plunder of the galleon?" said Scarlet Jack, with an
                  inquiring look.</p>
               <p>"The head, gentlemen—the head only," replied Red Martin. "I had it divided into
                  three parts—the head I have chosen for my own table—the other parts of the carcase
                  are for you."</p>
               <p>"You are too generous," said Blackbeard. "You should have supplied your own table
                  with it."</p>
               <p>"Not so, captain," replied Red Martin; "our spoils must be spared. It would seem
                  swinish, indeed, in me to claim the whole pig as mine."</p>
               <p>"A good joke—a capital joke—ha, ha, ha!" laughed Scarlet Jack. "I did not know,
                  you were a wag, chief."</p>
               <p>"When you are better acquainted with him," remarked Blackbeard, "you will
                  acknowledge our chief a right merry, companionable fellow."</p>
               <p>"You flatter me, worthy compeers," said Red Martin. "But, let's below—our
                  appetites must be whetted by a taste of that old aqua ardiente."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6945-00000026"/>
               <p>"Certainly, chief—such an invitation would be hard to refuse," replied the leading
                  conspirator.</p>
               <p>The guests followed their chief into his state-room, where they regaled themselves
                  with a draught or two of most excellent brandy, which formed a portion of the
                  spoils taken from a French brig, which the pirates had boarded and plundered but
                  ten days previous, while pursuing her voyage to Buenos Ayres.</p>
               <p>Dinner was now announced, and they were ushered into the cabin, where a banquet
                  had been prepared of many sumptuous delicacies—the grand feature, however, being
                  concealed beneath a massive gold cover. Upon a side-table stood many bottles of
                  wines of the richest description; and several negro slaves, in oriental costume,
                  stood in readiness to wait upon the guests. At the head of the table sat Haidee,
                  arrayed as richly as an Indian princess, her arms, head and neck, sparkling with a
                  profuse display of diamonds, rubies, pearls, and other precious stones, in costly
                  settings.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, brave gentlemen, to our banquet," said she, assuming a queen-like
                  bearing.</p>
               <p>Thanks, noble, courteous lady," said the hypocritical Blackbeard. "It gives me
                  pleasure unbounded to meet you thus. Never did empress upon her throne shine with
                  greater lustre, or possess a more dignified bearing than thyself, fair lady."</p>
               <p>"No fulsome flattery, I beg of you, captain," replied Haidee, pleasantly, and with
                  a smile of complacency. "But, allow me, friends, to pledge you in a glass of wine,
                  ere the covers be raised."</p>
               <p>The guests readily acquiesced by a courteous bow.</p>
               <p>"What shall it be, gentlemen," she resumed. "We have here a golden sherry from
                  Xeres, distinguished for its lightness, mellowness and richness; brown sherry,
                  esteemed by connoisseurs for its age, and peculiar nutty flavor; a red wine from
                  Greece, considered exceedingly delicious by the lovers of sweet wines; but here,
                  gentlemen, is a rarity—a bottle of Mexican wine, supposed to be about thirty-seven
                  years of age, but of excellent quality, you will admit; it has great body, its
                  color is blood-red; it is said to have the remarkable quality of giving great
                  courage to those who partake of it; and what is more singular than all, drink
                  however freely you may of it, it never intoxicates, unless other liquor is mixed
                  with it. Therefore, gentlemen, I freely <unclear>commend</unclear> it."</p>
               <p>"After such an eloquent description of the qualities of a wine, from the lips of a
                  fair lady, he must be a heathen, indeed, who could refuse it," said Blackboard,
                  enthusiastically. "Wine from Mexico is a novel sound to my ears; but, speaking of
                  Mexico, reminds me of my lieutenant, San Malo. If I mistake not, he was bidden to
                  this feast of luscious things. I have not seen his face since I came aboard this
                  vessel."</p>
               <p>"You will, presently," replied Red Martin, with a peculiar emphasis. "He is
                  arranging his toilet in Davila's state-room."</p>
               <p>"I should be glad to hear his opinion regarding this Mexican wine you praise so
                  highly," said Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"He will be here in time," said the chief.</p>
               <p>"Come, gentlemen, let me fill up without delay," said Haidee, as she commenced
                  pouring the liquid spoken of into golden goblets, and causing them to be passed,
                  on a massive silver waiter, to her guests.</p>
               <p>"It has, indeed, a gloriously rich complexion," remarked Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"I never saw its equal," said Scarlet Jack. "If it belie not its color and its
                  body it will prove a nectar."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you will find it above all the praise I have bestowed upon it," said
                  Haidee.</p>
               <p>"I doubt it not," said Backbeard.</p>
               <p>"Will you drink also of this, Martin?" inquired Haidee.</p>
               <p>"Nay, my love—that wine must only be served to our most honored guests," answered
                  the chief. "Give me of the nut-flavored brown sherry."</p>
               <p>Red Martin's goblet was filled, and Haidee poured into her goblet the golden
                  sherry from Xeres.</p>
               <p>"I propose that Haidee give the toast," said Red Martin.</p>
               <p>"By all means," urged the guests.</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," replied Haidee. She again arose, and holding the golden goblet
                  above her head, said—Now, gentlemen, empty your goblets if you please, for the
                  toast which I shall propose deserves no dainty draught! I give you—"The Free
                  Rovers of Virginia Gorda!'—True to themselves—true to their profession! Whenever a
                  traitor is found among them, he deserves no less a fate than summary death!"</p>
               <p>"Bravo! bravo!" cried the two conspirators.</p>
               <p>They raised the brimful goblets to their lips, and drank off the contents at a
                  single draught. The effect of the blood-red liquid was instantaneous upon both of
                  the conspirators; it was no sooner drank, than a stream of blood issued from their
                  mouths!</p>
               <p>"Damned hag!" cried Scarlet Jack, as soon as his throat was cleared.</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, what is this?" demanded Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"The blood of a traitor!" answered <unclear>the</unclear> bold woman.</p>
               <p>"Whose blood?"</p>
               <p>"That of a Mexican wretch!" she replied. "Behold!" and she ordered the large
                  golden dish cover to be removed.</p>
               <p>Horror! what a hideous sight was there revealed! There lay, still dripping with
                  gore, the head of San Malo—the hideous, ghastly countenance, yet retaining the
                  expression it wore at the very moment when severed from the trunk!</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6945-00000027"/>
               <p>The two living traitors started back in amazement, and vainly clutched the hafts
                  of their sabres.</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Haidee; "you have drunk deeply of your vile comrade's blood; and
                  now will you partake of his gory head?"</p>
               <p>"Revenge! revenge!" cried the amazed pirates, as they strove to draw their sabres
                  from the scabbards; but vain was the effort—their arms had been seized by the
                  immediate presence of some half a dozen of the Thunderbolt's hardy crew, and were
                  forthwith pinioned by strong cords.</p>
               <p>"What means this outrage—this damned insult?" demanded Blackbeard, in a violent
                  rage.</p>
               <p>"It simply means that instead of our being in a situation to be massacred by you
                  to-night, you are now in our power, leaving us at liberty to do with you both as
                  may best suit our will and pleasure," coolly answered Red Martin.</p>
               <p>"I comprehend it all—we have been betrayed!" cried Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"No, ignoble monsters; you have betrayed yourselves," said Haidee.</p>
               <p>"Answer me one question, and I'm content to say no more. Did San Malo say aught of
                  us?" enquired Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"He say aught of his fellow-traitors?" ejaculated Haidee. "Let me answer
                  emphatically, no! His head would not have been lying there, trunkless, had he come
                  on board to expose a diabolical plot conceived by Blackbeard. We should have had
                  much reason to thank him for his allegiance, rather than to have severed his head
                  from his body."</p>
               <p>"How know you then of any plot, you accursed witch?" asked Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! rail on! whet my appetite more keenly, miserable wretches!" replied
                  Haidee. "But you shall be answered.—I have power you wot not of. Your plans are as
                  well known to me, as if I had stood bodily in your presence while they were
                  concocted."</p>
               <p>"Then thou art, indeed, a damned witch from hell!" exclaimed Blackbeard, trembling
                  with terror.</p>
               <p>"What I am I shall not reveal to you; but cunning as you profess to be, I am more
                  than your match. I have power over all traitors in our fleet, and power to prevent
                  the commission of treasonous or <unclear>mutinous</unclear> crimes. You have now
                  some evidence thereof."</p>
               <p>"We have, indeed," replied Scarlet Jack: "and on my knees I pray to this
                  all-powerful woman for mercy."</p>
               <p>"I shall be more merciful than you deserve," replied Haidee. "But your fate shall
                  be made known hereafter. For the present you are our prisoners, and your commands
                  are to be superseded seded by men who are more trustworthy. Officer, remove these
                  traitors hence!" she commanded. "Their presence longer will make me
                  unmerciful."</p>
               <p>The two conspirators were forthwith removed from the cabin, and conveyed to the
                  safe place assigned them beneath the hatches.</p>
               <p>The temporary command of the Raven was given to Antoine Davila, while the command
                  of the Shark was intrusted to the second lieutenant of the Thunderbolt, Pedro
                  Ximenes, a young Brazilian.</p>
               <p>What had taken place was communicated by Haidee, in person, to each of the crews,
                  which were compromised in the bold conspiracy. Its effect was so great that every
                  man, thus compromised, fell upon his knees, before his dread mistress, and
                  earnestly supplicated for mercy, promising allegiance to her power, and to that of
                  her husband.</p>
               <p>The fleet sailed on its course as though nothing had occurred. The sun that night
                  as it sank beneath the horizon, appeared like a ball of red fire, betokening, as
                  the sailors said, some great evil near at hand.</p>
               <p>If "coming events cast their shadows before," we have some thrilling scenes to
                  describe.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Tornado.—Peril of the Pirate Fleet.—An Interesting Interview.—A Speck upon
                     the Ocean.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHEN the twilight hour of that quiet day had passed, and the starry sentinels of
                  night took their places in the azure vault, the breeze fell, and there was not
                  sufficient breath to toss the light curls of a maiden's brow. The surface of the
                  ocean was undimpled, and lazily rolled its polished waves along. The vessels of
                  Red Martin's fleet sleepily rose and fell upon the swell with graceful, swan-like
                  motion. The hulls, spars, sails and line of rigging were painted in the
                  mirror-like surface with all the accuracy of reality. For four hours this calm
                  continued; but when midnight came, the howlings of the elements, at a great
                  distance, struck the ears of the watch. At first it was a faint moaning sound, but
                  gradually grew deeper and louder. A single dark speck, not bigger than a raven in
                  its flight, became now visible to the eyes of those who stood watch aboard the
                  corsair fleet.</p>
               <p>"All hands ahoy!" cried the officer of each deck.</p>
               <p>The boatswains' whistles screamed almost simultaneously, and in another moment,
                  every available man was at his post of duty. On board the Thunderbolt, the heavy
                  sails were lowered and furled firmly to their spars, while aloft, top-sail and
                  topgallant-sail were clewed up and secured to the yards with an alacrity seldom
                  seen, except on a well-disciplined man-of-war, after a three years' cruise. The
                  men of the Raven and the Shark followed the example of the flag-vessel, and in
                  less than three minutes the fleet sat idly in the water under bare poles, for as
                  yet in their immediate vicinity the calm prevailed.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, that small speck had expanded, and now spanned half the
                     <unclear>northwestern</unclear> sky. Presently, far astern, its black shadow
                  seemed suddenly to strike the waters, and came sweeping along with fearful
                  rapidity, breaking the smooth billows in its path, and putting the whole ocean
                  into angry commotion. Suddenly, almost like a bolt hurled from the clouds, the
                  fearful tornado struck the pirate fleet, and buried the prow of each vessel
                  beneath the wave, and lifted the stern high above the water! It was a fearful
                  moment, but it was anticipated, and every man stood firmly at his post. The
                  vessels quivered, and every timber from stem to stern quaked in sustaining the
                  heavy shock. The light spars were torn from their strong fastenings, as easily as
                  if they had been so many reeds confined by straws. The Shark's deck was washed by
                  a heavy roller which threatened to carry her to the bottom, but the hatches and
                  companion being fastened down, she gradually struggled to the surface, but every
                  movable thing was swept from her deck, except her batteries. The men had clung to
                  the rigging, and thus had escaped a watery grave. The foremast of the Raven had
                  gone by the board, and with it two men who had lashed themselves to the shrouds, a
                  most unfortunate precaution. The Thunderbolt sustained the dreadful blast with
                  less damage than either of the schooners. Her top-gallant-mast, after bending for
                  a moment like a reed in the hurricane, snapped off down to the cross-trees, and
                  was whirled away. Besides Red Martin and Haidee, there stood on that quarter-deck
                  the same commanding form who defended the Admiral in her hour of peril, and now he
                  was manfully battling the elements to save the pirate brigantine. Not that he felt
                  any sympathy for the buccaneers, but his soul-like energies were aroused only to
                  save the helpless ones, over whom he had assumed a paternal care. Thus far had
                  Captain Stark been treated more as a favored guest than as a prisoner, for he was
                  allowed the freedom of the quarter-deck, and was permitted a seat at the
                  chieftain's mess. Yet for all this they were pirates and enemies to all mankind,
                  therefore, gladly would he have been elsewhere, if his self-constituted charge had
                  also been out of their clutches. In the character of Haidee he saw much that was
                  truly noble, but her good traits did by no means compensate, in his mind, for the
                  fact that she was the wife of the chief—a being, but for the sway of her power,
                  would have committed as many bloody acts as that devil incarnate—the merciless.
                  Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>But we would not, in the midst of a storm, digress from our tale.—On the first
                  intimation of danger, Captain Stark leaped from his hammock, put on his
                  weather-beaten apparel, and rushed to the deck. He it was who first declared the
                  imminent peril in which the vessel would quickly be placed, and through his
                  advice, orders were given that had the effect to enable her to sustain so well the
                  bursting of the sweeping tornado upon them. Before the blast, under bare poles,
                  the vessels were driven with fearful rapidity. The waves rolled mountains, high,
                  threatening to swamp every object that floated upon the ocean's surface. For more
                  than an hour the tempest raged as it had commenced, and then the elements began to
                  abate their devastating fury. The night was fearfully dark, the binnacle-lights<pb
                     n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6945-00000029"/> were out, and the vessels were ploughing
                  onward at the mercy of the wind, whither no one could tell.</p>
               <p>When the first grey streaks of morning became visible, the tempest had subsided,
                  and only a fresh breeze blew from the northwest; the clouds became broken and
                  scattered, and blue sky was again visible; the billows which had tossed those
                  barks like so many corks upon their crests, gradually lessened, until they became
                  like ripples compared to what they were in the height of the tempest. Morning came
                  on apace, and Old Sol arose to gladden the hearts of all those who had sustained
                  the raging of the tornado. On board the Thunderbolt, the well-nigh exhausted men
                  looked upon each other with wondering eyes that they had survived the perils of
                  the few past hours!</p>
               <p>During the darkness of the night the piratical fleet had become separated, and
                  when Red Martin came on deck, after an hour's repose below, no sail was visible
                  within reach of his glass; Indeed, on no point of the compass could he detect a
                  single speck on the ocean's surface. That they had not weathered the gale the
                  pirate chief thought probable, and he began contemplating the effects of such a
                  disaster upon his future prospects, when he was aroused by Haidee.</p>
               <p>"You dream, Martin," said she.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Haidee," he answered; "I was thinking of the probable fate of the
                  schooners.—We have parted company."</p>
               <p>"They surely survived the first blast, and in that one moment, methought, was the
                  great peril."</p>
               <p>"True; but it was fearful for more than an hour," replied the chief. "My two
                  lieutenants to whom we gave the command of the two vessels were ill-experienced
                  for so great an emergency. Even ourselves are mainly indebted for our present
                  safety to the judgment and intrepidity of the Yankee captain."</p>
               <p>"Have you ascertained our present position?" she inquired.</p>
               <p>"If I have calculated rightly, we are within twelve or fifteen leagues, in a S. E.
                  direction, from Virginia Gorda."</p>
               <p>"Then why not change your course?" ejaculated Haidee. "Every moment is carrying us
                  from thence."</p>
               <p>"Think you it is best to visit that island again, now that, in all probability, we
                  are for ever freed from those crews which had conspired against us?"</p>
               <p>"Visit our island again!" reiterated Haidee, her eyes flashing with anger; "and
                  have you again allowed the insinuating devil, Temptation, to put ignoble thoughts
                  and desires into your ambitious brain? I blush with shame for your
                  weaknesses!"</p>
               <p>"And shall we lose this glorious opportunity of abandoning this adventurous life,
                  and forego the temptation of a life of delights in the salubrious Isle I have so
                  frequently described?"</p>
               <p>"That isle, Martin, I tell you again, we shall never behold," replied Haidee, with
                  emphasis. "The Fates have decreed it. Our destiny is marked out, and all our
                  efforts to effect a change will prove futile. So, no more of this, Martin, but at
                  once direct our course to Virginia Gorda."</p>
               <p>"With reluctance I comply with your will," replied the chief; "but I fear we shall
                  rue the hour that we neglected this favorable opportunity to pass."</p>
               <p>"You forget, Martin, that Blackbeard and his treasonous associate are beneath our
                  hatches?"</p>
               <p>"But they are as secure as heavy chains can make them."</p>
               <p>"You do not comprehend. You certainly have no desire to take these inhuman
                  monsters to the paradise you have so long desired to reach?"</p>
               <p>"No, by Heavens! they must die!"</p>
               <p>"By whose hand? Not yours, I hope, Martin. What beast can have the desire to
                  pollute his hand with the ignoble deed?"</p>
               <p>"No blood, Haidee! They shall walk the plank!"</p>
               <p>"By the holy Virgin, Martin! you provoke me by the bare mention of such an
                  act!—Though they deserve an ignominious death, let us not be their executioners!
                  We have had enough of such work. San Malo's death has satiated all my revenge
                  against the conspiring traitors. Once more, I say, let's have no more
                  butchery!"</p>
               <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the loud cry of "Sail ho!" from the man
                  Red Martin had sent aloft to see if either of his vessels could be descried.</p>
               <p>"Where away?" shouted the chief.</p>
               <p>"On our weather bow!" was the look-out's response.</p>
               <p>"I can scarcely believe that the Raven or Shark could have outsailed us," remarked
                  Red Martin to his wife, as he mounted the main ratlines with his glass, and
                  commenced surveying the ocean in the direction named.</p>
               <p>"By Pluto, I am right!" he continued; "it is no vessel, else my glass deceives me.
                  Port your helm!—steady!" he cried to the man at the tiller.</p>
               <p>"What then do you make of the object?" inquired Haidee.</p>
               <p>"I cannot exactly make it out," he replied. "There's a signal of distress flying
                  from a short spar. One more point to windward!" he cried, addressing the helmsman.
                  "Steady, now!"</p>
               <p>Taking another survey, he remarked to Haidee,—</p>
               <p>"It is either a dismasted, water-logged vessel, or raft—I cannot yet exactly make
                  out which. At all events, whatever it may prove to be, it is not of our fleet. Ah!
                  now I can view the object more distinctly—it certainly belongs not to us—there was
                  no swallow-tailed signal like that aboard of either of the schooners. It is a
                  raft, and now I perceive the form of a man<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6945-00000030"
                  /> leaning upon the upright spar, and I see other moving beings upon it. If I
                  mistake not, I now see a female form in a half-reclining posture. What's best to
                  be done? Shall we go to their succor, or shall we——"</p>
               <p>"Why do you put such a question?" interrupted Haidee, her brilliant eyes flashing
                  with anger.</p>
               <p>"They are not of our fleet; and there cannot be much plunder upon a
                  hastily-constructed raft!"</p>
               <p>"Shame on you, Martin. Were there so many dogs in peril, you could not do less
                  than to relieve them. Because you have committed barbarities from your youth
                  upward, does it destroy your capability of succoring the distressed? Cannot even a
                  ruthless corsair, once in a life-time do a good action? You can lose nothing by
                  occasionally acting like a human being, whose shape you wear. There may come a
                  time, Martin, when it may avail you much; at all events, whatever may betide you,
                  your enemies cannot say but you once did a noble deed!"</p>
               <p>"No more, I beseech you, Haidee," replied Red Martin; "I feel the full force of
                  all your meaning. You are my oracle—my very life—your advice shall be followed.
                  Whoever those sufferers are, they shall be saved by the corsair, and have a
                  corsair's protection!"</p>
               <p>"Nobly spoken," said Haidee.</p>
               <p>The chief immediately gave orders to set all sail, and bear up for the raft: the
                  which will afford us matter for another chapter, which we commend to our readers,
                  inasmuch as it will have a direct bearing upon the plot of this tale of
                  adventures.</p>

                     Situation.—Terrors of the Crew.—The Raft—Abandoning of the Bark.—The Tempest
                     subsides.—Morning.—A Sail descried.—An Unexpected Surprise.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT night of terrors, already described, a stately bark was tossed upon the
                  billows of the turbulent Gulf, near the Carribean Sea. She was an Indiaman, of and
                  from a once noted port of the old Bay State, and bound to Canton. She was
                  commanded by Capt. Owen, with a crew of eighteen men, and there were, besides,
                  seven passengers on board, three of whom were females.</p>
               <p>When the devastating tornado swept over that wild waste of waters, the bark in one
                  moment was raised on a mountain of water, and in the next was precipitated into an
                  abyss, where she appeared to await the coming of another sea. The perpetual
                  howling of the elements, echoing through the void, produced such terrible
                  sensations in the minds of the seamen, that they seemed struck with a
                  stupefaction; and those little inured to the dangers of the ocean, added wild
                  shrieks and lamentations to this scene of misery. As if to complete their terrors,
                  a heavy roller, which seemed like a mighty cataract approaching broke over her
                  stern, carrying away the rudder, starting the stern, post from the hauden ends,
                  and indeed, shattering her whole stern frame. Simultaneously, her main, fore and
                  mizzen masts went by the board, and seven of that terrified crew, and two of the
                  male passengers, were swept into the ocean. The pumps were now sounded and water,
                  to the depth of three feet, was found in her hold. A gang of men was now ordered
                  to work the pumps, which they continued for nearly two hours, notwithstanding the
                  water increased rather than diminished. Although the violence of the storm had now
                  greatly abated, it did not lessen the terrors of that dismayed ship's company. It
                  was clearly evident to all that no human power could for many hours keep the bark
                  afloat, and the captain began devising means by which they might save the lives of
                  that decimated crew. The small yawl was ordered out—the long boat having<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6945-00000031"/> been crushed by the weight of a falling
                  spar—but Captain Owen having fears that the men might be tempted to make off in
                  her, he ordered his second mate aboard, and giving him a sword and a pair of
                  pistols, told him to cut down or shoot the first man who should dare even to
                  suggest such a diabolical attempt. The boat, after exceeding difficulty, was got
                  afloat and hauled up to the gangway; a raft was then ordered to be constructed of
                  the floating spars which still adhered to the loose rigging. A faint hope now
                  dawning upon the minds of the men, they shook off their dismay, and went to work
                  with an alacrity almost incredible. In the course of half an hour they had
                  succeeded in lashing many of the spars together, and there being, fortunately, a
                  number of planks in her holds, these were hoisted out and spiked to the spars.</p>
               <p>In the meantime the pumps had been worked for the purpose of keeping the hull
                  afloat as long as possible; but now, the raft being constructed, the gang were
                  ordered to get over several casks of water, beef, biscuit, and such other
                  provisions as could be readily got at. Half an hour was consumed in this duty, and
                  after the passengers, consisting only of one male and two females, had got upon
                  the raft—the captain threatening the first man who should dare to precede them—the
                  crew were ordered to abandon the bark, Captain Owen reluctantly following his men,
                  he being the last to tread the deck of the sinking hulk. It was with equal
                  reluctance that he caused the raft of safety to be cut adrift; and luckily was it
                  that he delayed no longer, for scarcely had they floated from her a distance of
                  thirty yards, when the stern settled beneath the ocean's surface, and down she
                  plunged, stern foremost, the last object visible being the bowsprit.</p>
               <p>It was now broad daylight, and after rigging up a jurymast and hoisting a signal
                  of distress, the Captain took up his position beside it, with the hope of espying
                  a chance sail, which was their only prospect of salvation in that broad ocean.</p>
               <p>Before proceeding farther in our narrative, we must introduce to the reader one or
                  two more characters, of some importance to the true course of our story.</p>
               <p>Among the three female survivors of the wreck, was one of extreme beauty. She was
                  the captain's only offspring, and had attained the age of seventeen years. Amy
                  Owen had accompanied her father on one previous voyage to India, and her father,
                  rather than leave her to the care of friends in her native town,—her mother having
                  died while she was in a state of infancy—chose to be her constant guardian;
                  therefore he took her to sea with him. Amy had a lover, unknown to her father, and
                  this was her only cause of objection at leaving, but what was her surprise and
                  delight upon ascertaining, after the bark had weighed anchor and got fairly to
                  sea, that the dear object of her devotion, Charles Thorburn, was her fellow
                  passenger. This joyful surprise, however, was concealed from her father; for the
                  youth took good care to make known his presence to her in the cabin, while the old
                  gentleman walked the quarter-deck. Thorburn, at his own urgent request, had been
                  commissioned by his uncle, a rich bachelor who had acquired a fortune in India, to
                  take passage for Canton to look after quite a handsome investment he had made in a
                  company speculation out there. During that night of peril, Thorburn had performed
                  the duties of a seaman, and had received the commendations of the father of Amy,
                  which was a rich reward in the mind of the youth. He had become so exhausted with
                  a toil to which he was not inured, that he sank upon the raft immediately on
                  reaching it; but Amy's minisistering hand soon revived him, without exciting her
                  father's suspicions touching the mischief Cupid had been doing to his beloved
                  child's heart. The youth soon fell into a profound slumber, while the fond girl,
                  in a half-reclining posture, watched him while he slumbered.</p>
               <p>Soon the joyful tidings were announced by Capt. Owen, to that exhausted company
                  that a sail was in sight. For an hour had he strained his eyes upon that ocean,
                  ere he dared announce that it was a sail. Gradually it enlarged, the hull became
                  visible, and he then saw that the vessel was bearing directly towards them.
                  Slowly, indeed, to that impatient mariner did it approach; and now, when he
                  discovered that it was an armed brigantine and in those seas, he began to wonder
                  to what nation it could belong. More than once did the awful thought flit across
                  his brain that she might be a pirate, and his soul shuddered, and he inwardly
                  prayed to heaven to avert the calamity of having a ruthless band of buccaneers
                  sent in among them. His fears he dared not give audible expression to; but soon
                  his fear was changed to joy, for, in lieu of the expected black flag, the ensign
                  of Portugal was run up to the mast-head.</p>
               <p>With the first wave of the flag from the truck the brigantine hove to, and the
                  loud hail of an officer was heard by Capt. Owen, who made a quick response, and in
                  a few words explained the cause of his peculiar situation.</p>
               <p>The Thunderbolt's barge was readily manned by four stout oarsmen, with orders to
                  take the sufferers from the raft, and bring them aboard. This command was promptly
                  obeyed, and scarcely had a half hour elapsed when all the survivors of the hapless
                  bark were assembled on the brigantine's deck.</p>
               <p>On ascertaining that they were the countrymen and countrywomen of Captain Stark,
                  Haidee went below and called him to the deck, first giving him the precaution not
                  to expose, at the peril of their lives, the true character of the vessel aboard of
                  which the strangers had found a refuge.</p>
               <pb n="64" xml:id="VAC6945-00000032"/>
               <p>At the companion way he met Captain Owen. Both were thunderstruck.</p>
               <p>"In God's name, Captain Stark, how came you here?" ejaculated Owen, seizing the
                  hand of his old shipmate and friend.</p>
               <p>"Let me first ask of you that question, my old friend!" said Stark.</p>
               <p>"I was wrecked in the gale last night, and here is my daughter, and the survivors
                  of my ship's company. Alas, the Adriatic, and a dozen or more souls are beneath
                  the ocean wave! Tell me the fate of the Admiral."</p>
               <p>"Another time," answered Stark. "Be content now that you have not fallen into
                  worse hands." This remark was made in a low tone.</p>
               <p>Heartfelt thanks were now poured out to the commander of the Thunderbolt who
                  promised them every protection.</p>
               <p>The brigantine now bore away for Virginia Gorda, and ere night-fall this isle was
                  in full view from the brigantine.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Description of Virginia Gorda.—How the Pirates became possessed of it.—The
                     Capture of the British Gun-brigs.—The Prisoners.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE island of Virginia Gorda, to which we have so frequently alluded, is one of a
                  small group, known at the period of which we write to all navigators as the Virgin
                  Isles. That of Virginia Gorda, the lesser of the group, was not known to be
                  inhabited at that time, although it was supposed to be the haunt of some of the
                  numerous bands of buccaneers, which infested the tropical seas, and whose power
                  was so great that no force sufficiently formidable could be concentrated to cope
                  against them. Less was known of Virginia Gorda than of either of the group. No
                  expedition had ever been sent to explore the face of the island, its harbors,
                  inlets, &amp;c. To the mariner it ever presented an inhospitable prospect; the
                  shores were bold and rocky, and coral reefs extended out in almost every
                  direction, like so many huge arms, menacing with destruction all vessels that
                  dared approach within a league's distance of the rugged shore. The navigator,
                  especially whenever the sky presented forebodings of a storm, always took good
                  care to give Virginia Gorda a wide berth. In truth, it was considered but a barren
                  and rocky excrescence upon the ocean, and therefore unworthy of exploration.</p>
               <p>Yet, in spite of outward appearances, there were those who had made it an
                  undisturbed refuge for years; and to them it smiled like a paradise upon earth.
                  And it is not strange that they thought so, for a lovelier isle the globe scarcely
                  contains. It is nearly of an elliptic shape, and a high, natural wall of craggy
                  rock completely surrounds it, with the exception of a narrow, irregular inlet
                  extending to a small bay, where vessels can ride safely at anchor in the most
                  violent tropical gale, and perfectly hidden from the view of all outside. From the
                  high borders to the centre the ground gradually slopes the soil is very fertile,
                  and every description of tropical fruits then grew here in their greatest
                  perfection, without the aid of cultivation from man. There were beautiful orange
                  groves, the blossoms<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6945-00000034"/> of which made
                  fragrant the whole island. Figs, grapes, lemons, bread-fruit and nuts, of the most
                  delicious varieties, grew in great abundance.</p>
               <p>It was on this island that Red Martin, (and Haidee,) the most powerful of all the
                  buccaneer host, now held undivided sway. It was he who was the second successor of
                  Kidd, who first stepped foot upon its shores, and discovered its great natural
                  advantages as a place of rendezvous, and of refuge in times of danger. As its
                  discovery, as a haven of safety, was purely accidental, we will here introduce the
                  incident, as tradition has handed it down; for the authenticity of which, however,
                  we have no written or printed record.</p>
               <p>Soon after the British government had received positive evidence of Captain Kidd's
                  abandoning the king's service, and declaring himself a Free Rover, the king sent
                  two gun-brigs for the purpose of capturing him. After a three weeks' cruise, they
                  discovered Kidd's vessel on the very day that he had plundered and scuttled a
                  large English merchantman, on her homeward passage from Valparaiso. The gun-brigs
                  immediately gave chase; but Kidd's vessel being their equal in speed, he kept them
                  at long gun-shot distance, for upwards of two days. On the third day, however, the
                  chase gained upon him, and he saw that his vessel must fall into their hands,
                  unless he made a desperate effort to avert it. He therefore made a run for the
                  dangerous shores of Virginia Gorda, of which he knew but little, concluding that
                  if he chanced to escape from being dashed in pieces on the reefs, the gun-brigs
                  would not dare to follow.—In he steered, apparently among the breakers,—it was a
                  fearful hazard, but a chance wave carried him, most luckily, into a narrow channel
                  running between two reefs. As he neared the bold, rocky cliff, he found that the
                  channel rounded through a glen, not much wider than the vessel. Through this he
                  steered, and at the distance of ten rods he found himself entirely concealed from
                  the ocean, and in a little placid bay, capable, perhaps, of admitting three or
                  four small vessels. Here was a secure harbor and good anchorage.</p>
               <p>Kidd, followed by half a dozen men, leaped ashore and ascended a bold promontory
                  which overlooked the sea, to observe the movements of his pursuers. Contrary to
                  his expectations, the gun-brigs continued on in his dangerous wake, but were less
                  fortunate. With exultation the buccaneer saw the foremost of the chase, carried by
                  a heavy sea broadside upon the breakers, and dashed to pieces! Many of her crew
                  were lost, and the remainder were picked up with exceeding difficulty by her
                  company, who ventured not so near the islet except in their boats. Nearly the
                  whole of a day and the succeeding night were spent in the arduous and hazardous
                  duty of getting off the survivors and articles of value from the wreck. Morning
                  came, and ere they could make sail and get away, out from the rocky battlements,
                  as they appeared to his enemies, the Pirate craft made her appearance with every
                  preparation to give battle to the enemy who had dared so long to pursue her. In
                  the midst of a constant cannonading by both vessels, Kidd slowly followed the
                  channel he had so luckily discovered, and made his way into the open sea in
                  safety. The British vessel, being now overladen and encumbered with articles from
                  the wreck, saw no hope of escaping; and to offer resistance was equally hopeless;
                  yet it was their only alternative. They, therefore, cleared the deck as well as
                  possible for action, determining to fight their bloody enemy to the last. The
                  contest was a brief but bloody one. The pirates first succeeded in dismasting the
                  brig, and then raked her deck in the most unmerciful manner. Soon Kidd ran
                  alongside, and when he had gained a footing upon her deck, there were not twenty
                  of the brig's crew, but what were either dead or wounded. These were quickly
                  dispatched by the cutlasses of the pirates. Not one was left to tell his comrades'
                  fate!</p>
               <p>Kidd now found himself the possessor of two vessels; he caused the brig to be
                  towed into the secret inlet, where she was forthwith re-rigged and put in
                  tolerable sailing condition. The armament from the wrecked brig, together with
                  spars, rigging, &amp;c., were carried into the newly discovered haven; for Kidd
                  had not only determined to make this place his favorite haunt, but he absolutely
                  fortified the only entrance by a formidable battery formed of the wrecked brig's
                  heavy guns.</p>
               <p>His crew then set about exploring the island, and to their great delight, they
                  found it fertile, and teeming with the richest luxuries of a foreign clime. They
                  found numerous caverns, some of which were converted into habitable apartments,
                  and afterwards were sumptuously furnished with spoils from cabins of plundered
                  vessels.</p>
               <p>But as our story belongs to a much more recent period, we will not pursue Kidd's
                  career farther, having accomplished our object of showing how the secret haven of
                  Virginia Gorda was discovered, and how well it was adapted to the purposes of
                  these sea-marauders.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>At the period Red Martin with the Thunderbolt ran into the inlet of Virginia
                  Gorda, there were but some half dozen pirates, besides his half score of slaves,
                  upon the island. The former having become superannuated and unfit for sea, were
                  left in charge of the immense property there accumulated. There<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000035"/> was no fear nor even possibility of any one's
                  escaping from the island, for the chief took the precaution, whenever he absented
                  himself, not to leave a single boat behind.</p>
               <p>Immediately on their arrival, Capt. Stark, Mrs. Bertine and the infant Oceana,
                  together with the survivors of the Adriatic, were removed from the Thunderbolt to
                  one of the pirates' caves. The one allotted to them adjoined that of the chief,
                  and had several apartments which were fitted up in a tasteful, and even luxurious
                  manner. A guard was placed over them, but they were permitted to walk forth, but
                  obliged to confine their rambles to certain prescribed limits.</p>
               <p>Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack, with the permission of Haidee, were removed from the
                  brigantine to the pirates' prison, formed of a nook in the rock, just within the
                  inlet. This prison was constantly guarded by one or more trusty sentinels; the
                  inmates were loaded with chains; an iron-grated door closed the entrance and
                  escape seemed impossible.</p>
               <p>Having thus explained the situation of affairs upon the island, at this particular
                  juncture, we must now look after the missing vessels of the buccaneer fleet, in
                  order to render unbroken the chain of our narrative.</p>

                     Ximenes.—Expedition for freeing the Traitorous Prisoners of Red Martin.—The

               </argument>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the predictions and the hopes of Red Martin, the Raven and the
                  Shark rode out the gale, with but small damage to sails, spars and rigging, and as
                  soon as they could make repairs, and ascertain their latitude and longitude, they
                  stood for Virginia Gorda. Early in the morning they discovered that they had
                  parted company with the Thunderbolt, and fears were entertained by the young
                  commanders, Antoine Davila and Pedro Ximenes, that she had foundered during that
                  night of terrors. Davila, desiring a consultation with Ximenes, signalized to that
                  officer to come aboard the Raven. He complied with the request, and the two
                  entered the cabin. No sooner had they done so, than the boatswain of the Raven
                  gathered together, in the forecastle, the whole crew of pirates, with the
                  exception of three or four men who comprised the morning watch on deck, and
                  briefly addressed them in subdued tones. In substance the boatswain, who gloried
                  in the significant sobriquet of Daredevil, spoke as follows;—</p>
               <p>"Comrades—you have all had evidence that Red Martin, who has long been our chief,
                  is no true corsair. He has, contrary to our wishes, superseded our noble
                  Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack, by two contemptible striplings, who are his servile
                  creatures. Now, the golden opportunity occurs that will enable us to glut our
                  vengeance, take possession of the Raven and Shark, and sail to rescue our leaders,
                  who are the close prisoners of Red Martin and that detestable beldame, Haidee. Do
                  this, and a glorious reward awaits us. You that have the courage and the hearts to
                  follow me, lay your hands upon this trusty cutlass!" Saying this, the boatswain
                  drew his weapon, and not a man was there who did not promptly acquiesce in the
                  boatswain's wishes.</p>
               <p>"One by one call down the deck-watch!" he continued.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6945-00000036"/>
               <p>The men came and readily gave in their adhesion to the diabolical design, which
                  had been suddenly conceived in the boatswain's brain.</p>
               <p>"Comrades," he said, "we have not a moment's time to lose. Draw your cutlasses and
                  follow one who swears to die, or throw off the shackles of the tyrant. Let us
                  beard his creatures in their den. Show no quarter—they must die! Follow—one blow
                  and the victory is ours!"</p>
               <p>The boatswain and his men came upon the deck, and at a given signal, they ran aft,
                  and rushed into the cabin, ere Davila and Ximenes were made aware of their
                  perilous situation. They started to their feet, amazed at the menacing manner of
                  their men. They seized their sabre hilts, but ere they could draw them from their
                  scabbards, each officer received a blow which felled him bleeding to the cabin
                  floor. They were then seized, dragged to the deck, and after mutilating their
                  bodies in a barbarous manner, cast them into the sea.</p>
               <p>A boat was forthwith manned by half a dozen or more resolute men, headed by
                  Daredevil, the boatswain, and put off for the Shark. The returning of the boat
                  excited no suspicions in the second officer of the Raven, but when it came
                  alongside, and he saw that it contained only the men of the Raven, he readily
                  divined the whole truth. Although a faithful adherent to Red Martin, yet he well
                  knew that the major part of his crew were his bitter enemies, and were ripe for
                  mutiny whenever a favorable opportunity should occur. He therefore saw that
                  resistance was inevitable destruction to himself and all who would dare to stand
                  by him, and that he could better serve his chief by yielding up his command on the
                  first intimation of the mutineers' errand, and to pretend to sanction the justice
                  of the cause.</p>
               <p>Daredevil boldly came upon the deck followed by his men, and announced the death
                  of Antoine Davila and Pedro Ximenes, and that both vessels were now in the
                  possession of their rightful owners!</p>
               <p>A loud shout of exultation followed this announcement, in which the officer of the
                  deck seemed to join, as he, as a matter of form gave up his sword to the leader of
                  the mutineers. Daredevil hereupon addressed the assembled crew, and suggested that
                  their first business should be to select a proper man for their temporary
                  commander. With one accord, Henry Lafitte, a Creole of New Orleans, was named and
                  confirmed with shouts of approbation. He was a young man for such a post, being
                  not more than twenty-one years of age; but what he lacked in years he made up in
                  activity, shrewdness, courage and energy. He accepted the post and entered at once
                  upon the discharge of its responsible duties.</p>
               <p>The next matter, said Daredevil, which should animate all their hearts, was the
                  delivery out of the hands of their tyrant chief, their favorite commanders,
                  Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>This suggestion met with a hearty response, and they all swore victory and
                  vengeance! or death and destruction!</p>
               <p>Daredevil, with his followers, now returned to their own vessel. The same
                  suggestions being made to the Raven's men, the boatswain was selected by
                  acclamation to succeed the unfortunate Davila.</p>
               <p>Both of the newly appointed officers selected their subordinates—all true men, of
                  their inclining. Thus officered, the two vessels spread all their canvas, and
                  continued on the course towards their favorite haunt.</p>
               <p>On the night of the fourth day subsequent to the subversion of Red Martin's power,
                  aboard the Shark and the Raven, the vessels hove-to off Virginia Gorda. The night
                  was a misty one, which enabled them to approach within a half mile of the inlet,
                  without any possibility of being observed from any part of the isle. An expedition
                  had been planned by Daredevil to run up the inlet in a small boat, for the
                  purposes of reconnoitering, and ascertaining, if possible, if the Thunderbolt had
                  reached her haven, and also to learn the fate of Blackbeard and Scarlet Jack. The
                  boat was manned, and with Daredevil as leader, they rowed cautiously up the narrow
                  channel with muffled oars. Noiselessly did they glide along until they reached the
                  inlet, when they were discovered by the sentinel who guarded the door of the rocky
                  dungeon.</p>
               <p>"Quien vive!" demanded the sentinel who was an old Castilian.</p>
               <p>No answer was made. He leveled his carbine, and demanded in the English tongue,
                  "Who goes?"</p>
               <p>"Friends!"</p>
               <p>"The word?"</p>
               <p>"Death to Traitors!"</p>
               <p>"Pass."</p>
               <p>"Did not old Perez know a true pirate's voice from that of an interloper?" asked
                  the boatswain, as the boat drew near the spot were the sentinel stood.</p>
               <p>"Ah! by San Iago! Well do I know the voice of Senor Bosey Daredevil! There's not
                  one like it in the fleet. But, by what good fortune were you fished from the vasty
                  deep?"</p>
               <p>"I've been on the sea, not under it, good Perez."</p>
               <p>"Is all safe, then?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, safe as the secret of a dead man."</p>
               <p>"But it is thought by our chief that both of the schooners were engulphed during
                  the tornado."</p>
               <p>"Ah, then we shall disappoint our noble chief with happy<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000037"/> intelligence," said Daredevil, knowing the
                  sentinel's faithfulness to Red Martin. "For know you, good Perez, that both of the
                  vessels are just outside the reefs; but it is so thick to night, we dared not try
                  the channel."</p>
               <p>"Red Martin will approve of your cautiousness."</p>
               <p>"When did he arrive?"</p>
               <p>"Two nights since. Pity it is you did not arrive a few hours sooner. We've had a
                  grand carousal to-night; and 'tis less than an hour since the chief himself
                  retired."</p>
               <p>"Then I'll not disturb him with the news of our arrival tonight," said Daredevil;
                  "but tell me, good Perez, what disposition has been made of those two traitor
                  captains?"</p>
               <p>"Safe—safe, Senor Bosey! ha, ha!" chuckled the Spaniard, as he significantly
                  thrust his thumb over his left shoulder, indicating that they were within the
                  prison, over which he supposed he was performing his duty as a faithful
                  sentinel.</p>
               <p>"I fully comprehend!" said Daredevil. "So good night, honest sentinel; but not
                  yet, good Perez," he continued, as if a sudden thought had just entered his brain;
                  "I had like to have forgotten the most important part of my errand ashore tonight.
                  Perhaps, my old friend, you can accommodate us from your guard-house stores, with
                  a few bottles of choice brandy. Every cask aboard has been stove, and every bottle
                  is dry as a flour-barrel. We have had a dry as well as a rough time of it, good
                  Perez."</p>
               <p>"Wait till Gaspardo comes to relieve me, and upon my faith in the immaculate
                  Virgin, you shall be supplied."</p>
               <p>"How near to the time is it?"</p>
               <p>"Not above thirty minutes."</p>
               <p>"We cannot, good Perez, tarry so long."</p>
               <p>"You know the penalty of leaving a post without a substitute?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! that I do! and I commend you for your caution; but, I will be your
                  substitute," said Daredevil, leaping ashore. "Give me your carbine!"</p>
               <p>"But——"</p>
               <p>"Oh, never you fear, my good, generous Perez. You hasten and bring hither the
                  liquor that we are thirsting for, and I'll manage to prevent these rascally,
                  mutinous captains from slipping through my fingers! Oh no! I'm too old a cat for
                  that."</p>
               <p>"It's contrary to orders," replied the sentinel; "but as I know Senor Daredevil,
                  you've had a severe time of it, and the chief accounts you as one of his most
                  faithful subjects, you shall have the good aqua ardiente, for we've abundance in
                  store since the Thunderbolt's arrival, and 'tis but just that you should have a
                  share of it."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that's a good soul, Perez," said Daredevil, as he received the duped
                  sentinel's carbine. "Now, hasten your steps."</p>
               <p>But Daredevil well knew that Perez's old limbs would carry him but slowly up the
                  steep ascent, or this last caution would not have been given. With all his
                  exertions it took the veteran buccaneer some five minutes to reach the summit of
                  the bluff, and then he had some seventy rods farther to go to reach a small cave,
                  which served the band as a guard-house.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the old man out of hearing, than Daredevil's men leaped ashore, and
                  forced open the barred gates of the dungeon with their oars and weapons. This
                  being accomplished, they hurried through a narrow, rocky passage, and having
                  forced open the principal cell door, they stood in the presence of the objects of
                  their search, revealed to them by a dim light which was suspended from the rocky
                  roof of this dismal dungeon.</p>
               <p>Joy beamed from the eyes of the prisoners, as they beheld their ally and friend,
                  the fearless Daredevil, backed by a half dozen bold buccaneers, who had dared to
                  espouse their cause, even at the hazard of an ignominious death.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Daredevil! by all the lucky saints in the calendar!" exclaimed
                  Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"How, in the name of fortune, did you deceive that vigilant sentinel, old Perez?"
                  was the ejaculation of Scarlet Jack.</p>
               <p>"Ask no questions—we have no time for answers," hurriedly replied the
                  boatswain.—"Suffice it that we are here to remove this tyrant's chains which bind
                  your sturdy limbs, and give you liberty."</p>
               <p>This was easily done, for it had been a part of the boatswain's duty to enchain
                  and liberate prisoners aboard ship, and he carried the requisite implements in his
                  pocket.</p>
               <p>"Now follow me," said the boatswain, upon the rising of the traitors once more to
                  their feet; "tread cautiously, utter not a sound, and you shall once more breathe
                  the fragrant air of our isle, which we may soon have undisturbed possession
                  of."</p>
               <p>They groped their way along cautiously towards the cavern's mouth; but ere we
                  describe with what success, we must bring other actors before the reader, who
                  played a part in the animated scene that ensued.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Again we are pleased to refer to our sooty friend, Mungo, who still maintained his
                  situation aboard of the Raven, and was unsuspected of being any other than an
                  allegiant to the conspirators.</p>
               <p>When Daredevil set forth on the hazardous enterprise of<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000038"/> liberating his masters, Mungo silently crept out of
                  the forward port-hole of the schooner, and by means of a piece of loose rigging,
                  silently slid into the water;—then sinking beneath the surface, he swam some
                  twenty yards in the direction the boat had taken, without showing his head above
                  the sea. By this means he gained a sufficient distance from the schooner to
                  prevent any one aboard from observing him; and he also kept far enough astern of
                  the boat to escape the observation of any one of the expedition.—Every yard of the
                  narrow channel Mungo knew well; and his supple limbs and expertness in swimming,
                  enabled him to reach the mouth of the inlet about the same time that Daredevil was
                  challenged by the veteran guard; and here the first conversation between the
                  latter and the boatswain fell distinctly upon his ear. Learning the full intent of
                  their errand, he crept with stealth-like but nimble pace up the rocky height, and
                  then with all possible speed, ran to intercept old Perez on his way to the
                  guard-house. He ran up cautiously behind him, and tapping him on the back, he said
                  in low but eager tones,—</p>
               <p>"Back, back, for your life, Massa Perez! You've been deceibe by dat
                  Daredebil!"</p>
               <p>"Holy virgin, protect me!" uttered the old man, frightened almost out of his
                  senses, and falling, as if he had been seized by an ague fit, upon his knees.</p>
               <p>"You dam scarecrow!" exclaimed the negro; "let Mungo make you 'fraid! Get up,—your
                  pris'ners will escape—gib me de dungeon keys, and run after me fass you can—make
                  no noise, or de debil Bosey will hab bof our heads!"</p>
               <p>The old sentinel began to recover from his affright, and knowing the faithfulness
                  of Mungo, he began to be sensible of the error he had committed in leaving his
                  post.</p>
               <p>The negro snatched the bunch of keys from Perez's belt, and hastened towards the
                  dungeon, followed by the sentinel with a speed he had not attained in ten years
                  before. On reaching the edge of the bluff, Mungo looked down the steep, and to his
                  great joy he saw that every one of Daredevil's men had entered the cavern! With an
                  inward chuckle, he commenced descending with as little noise as possible. On his
                  hands and knees he crept to the cavern's entrance, and finding no one guarding it,
                  he cautiously closed the door, which swung outwardly. Unluckily, he discovered
                  that the huge padlock was broken, but his quick ingenuity suggested to him a way
                  to secure the door. He folded the hasp over the padlock staple; then, taking the
                  heavy iron key, he thrust it into the loop, thus rendering the fastening quite as
                  strong as before. Then, seizing one of the oars which lay at the cavern's mouth,
                  he braced it as firmly as possible against the door.</p>
               <p>By this time the old sentinel had reached his post, and resumed his duty as if
                  nothing had happened, using his sabre for a weapon, instead of his old carbine he
                  had so unwittingly put into the possession of Daredevil.</p>
               <p>"Massa Perez! we hab got um all safe—ha, ha, ha, he, he, yah!" laughed Mungo.
                  "Dat's what dis darkey calls one dam good joke—he, he, he! Dey tink Mungo dam fool
                  like demselbes! But, Massa Perez, no you tell dem dam caged willains dat Mungo hab
                  ben here—make dem tink you cotched dem yousef, wid not nobody's 'sistance! Dey
                  tink you berry cunnin'—ha, ha, he, he, he, he!"</p>
               <p>Uttering this caution, and giving a hearty chuckle, he jumped into Daredevil's
                  boat, and sculled it up into the basin, and ran alongside the Thunderbolt. Being
                  challenged by the officer of the deck, he answered Mungo, which was sufficient;
                  for every man upon the island, when on guard duty, had instructions to let the the
                  chief's faithful slave to pass ad libitum. Learning from the challenger that Red
                  Martin was not aboard, he leaped ashore, and with his usual fleetness he directed
                  his steps towards his master's head-quarters, and was soon ushered into his
                  presence.</p>
               <p>The result of this visit, and what befel the conspirators will be given in the

                     Dungeon.—A torturing mode of Defence. Escape from the Cave and the awful
                     Consequences.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WITH a light step Mungo approached the couch on which the buccaneer chief was
                  enjoying a profound repose, and tapped him softly upon the shoulder.—This was
                  sufficient to arouse one who for so many years had been accustomed to awake on the
                  slightest intimation. On the instant Red Martin leaped from his luxurious couch to
                  the floor. In the complacent countenance of his faithful slave he saw nothing that
                  indicated impending danger, though he was somewhat startled at beholding him,
                  inasmuch as he supposed the Raven to be lost, and with her every soul on
                  board.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mungo! I'm glad to see you!" ejaculated the chief; "I feared the Raven had
                  foundered during the tornado."</p>
               <p>"No, Massa," said the slave, his eyes glistening with some pleasing intelligence;
                  "but I'se cotched um, Massa, I has!"</p>
               <p>"Who? what?"</p>
               <p>"Dem villains, massa."</p>
               <p>"What villains, Mungo?"</p>
               <p>"Well, massa, I muss fuss tell you some bery bad news," said the negro, a sad
                  expression stealing upon his features; "poor Capen Dabila and Capen Ximenes——"</p>
               <p>"Well; what of them?—let's have your news at once!"</p>
               <p>"Dey be bof murdered by dem debil conspiriters, and dey hab now de possession ob
                  bof de schooners!"</p>
               <p>"Hell and furies!" exclaimed Red Martin, almost choking with rage; "they shall be
                  fearfully avenged!"</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa; and dey be already cotched for you!"</p>
               <p>"What! are the schooners retaken?" asked the chief, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"No—not zacly, massa—but de leaders am—you see, massa, dat Bosey Daredebil wid
                  some oders come ashore dis night in de boat—I know'd dey comin' for mischief—so I
                  swim arter de boat, and when dey stop at de dungeon, I hear dar plan to set ole
                  Blackdebil and his bruder, Scarletdebil, free. Dey come de wool ober ole Perez
                  eyes, and he leabe his poss to get dem some liquor—I run arter him, and tellee him
                  to follow arter me—he bery much 'fraid, but he come—when dis chile creep to de
                  dungeon, he fine de door broke open, and dey all had gone in to bring de big
                  debils—so I juss shut de door, fasten it on de outside, jump in dar boat, and run
                  away to tellee massa all about um!"</p>
               <p>"Mungo, you shall be well rewarded for your ingenuity and your faithfulness; but
                  where is the sentinel now?"</p>
               <p>"He be dar, massa."</p>
               <p>"Any body with him?"</p>
               <p>"No, massa."</p>
               <p>"Then there is some danger of their escaping; so many inside might break the door
                  down, in spite of all the sentinel could do."</p>
               <p>"Zacly, massa—Mungo didn't tink ob dat," said the negro, scratching his thick,
                  woolly pate.</p>
               <p>Uttering these words, Mungo darted out of the entrance, while Red Martin attired
                  himself quickly, and went forth to summon the crew of the Thunderbolt, whose
                  rendezvous when ashore was in a spacious cavern but a few yards distant.</p>
               <p>But let us follow the negro. With his usual nimbleness he retraced his steps
                  towards the prison. Instead of availing himself of Daredevil's boat, he plunged
                  into the basin and swam to the opposite side. On reaching his destination, he
                  found old Perez closely contesting with the whole of the opposing force, who stood
                  just within the iron-grated door of the dungeon, while he stood without. They had
                  no power of doing him harm while the door stood between them; but he, with sabre
                  drawn, fought valiantly—now thrusting the blade between the interstices of the
                  grate, and now severing a finger or a hand of him who unluckily exposed either to
                  the stroke of the sabre. Those within were making superhuman efforts to make their
                  egress; but now a second person, whom they were unable to distinguish, had come to
                  the assistance of the sentinel, rendering their success still more hopeless. The
                  same novel warfare that old Perez was making Mungo adopted, and with equal effect.
                  The prisoners were enraged to an inconceivable desperation by the torturing wounds
                  which they received. They cursed and swore like so many madmen confined in Bedlam.
                  At length they rested for a new and an undivided effort to burst the barrier
                  between them and freedom. Simultaneously they rushed with all their force against
                  the door, and succeeded in forcing it far enough ajar to insert the barrel of the
                  carbine which Daredevil had taken from Perez. This renewed their hopes of escape,
                  and gave them additional strength. One effort more, using the carbine as a lever,
                  and they burst the door from its hinges, which snapped like the crack of a pistol
                  when they sundered.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6945-00000040"/>
               <p>Before this was done, however, Mungo saw that the wretches would succeed, and
                  having a good share of discretion as well as valor, he again plunged into the
                  water and was half across the basin before the prisoners again stood in open
                  air.</p>
               <p>Daredevil, knowing that Red Martin and his followers would soon be apprised of
                  their presence, darted for the place where they had left the boat, with the
                  intention of reaching the schooner; but great was their consternation when they
                  ascertained that it had been taken away, as they supposed, by Perez, whom they
                  would have quartered alive, had he not shown sufficient sagacity to be timely
                  among the missing.</p>
               <p>In this dilemma. Daredevil's party, including the two freed captains, had no
                  alternative but to creep cautiously up to the basin, and if possible seize one of
                  the Thunderbolt's boats, and make off in her to the schooner. With great caution
                  they proceeded up the inlet, and having all passed through the narrow passage, and
                  espying a boat on the opposite shore, it was agreed that two of their number
                  should swim across and bring it away. Two of the pirates volunteered upon this
                  hazardous enterprise, and in a few minutes without molestation carried over the
                  boat. With chuckles of exultation at their success thus far, they leaped into it,
                  and rowed out of the basin into the outlet; but here, like so many mice in a cage,
                  they were trapped!</p>
               <p>During the time they had carried into execution their only scheme of escape, a
                  party of Red Martin's men, well armed, had crept noiselessly down the opposite
                  bluff, stretched a chain tautly across the narrow channel about two inches above
                  the water's surface, and there awaited on each side the coming of the daring
                  conspirators. The boat came on swiftly—it struck the chain and rebounded; and at
                  the next moment, to their horror, a volley of musketry was poured in among them,
                  producing frightful havoc! With an unearthly shriek, Scarlet Jack leaped into the
                  air, and fell into the water a corpse, a bullet having pierced his heart! Three
                  other men were also shot dead, and tumbled one upon another in the boat! Daredevil
                  finding himself unscathed, took the precaution to dive beneath the surface, and
                  swam past the chief's men without raising his head above the water, and in this
                  manner escaped unperceived. Blackbeard, also, escaped the leaden shower. He
                  immediately leaped ashore and dashed up the steep, and out of the reach of their
                  shots before they could reload their carbines, but by no means out of danger. The
                  remainder of the expedition who escaped death were taken and thrust into the
                  dungeon, to await a certain death on the morrow! Blackbeard found a refuge for the
                  remainder of the night, in the crevice of a rocky bluff which overlooked the
                  sea.</p>
               <p>Daredevil succeeded in reaching the Raven, but he was too much exhausted to relate
                  to his companions the fate of that disastrous expedition.</p>
               <p>Singular as it may appear, the first man who came to the gangway to assist
                  Daredevil aboard of the schooner and into the cabin was Red Martin's slave, Mungo!
                  How he came there we leave to the imagination of the reader.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MORNING came, and Red Martin's men might have been seen in every direction,
                  scouring the island for their most ferocious and formidable enemy, Blackbeard. The
                  large masses of vapor which yet hung over the island, prevented the hunters from
                  seeing at a great distance. By and by a breeze from the north sprang up, the sun
                  arose, and the misty curtain began to lift itself from the earth, and breaking
                  into a hundred fantastic forms, rolled one over another like billows of smoke—then
                  scudded off in the dim distance like a troop of evil spirits, leaving that lovely
                  isle as bright and beautiful as a houri's paradise. The sea too became clear, and
                  objects were distinguishable to the naked eye at a vast distance; the waves
                  glittered with the golden rays of the King of Day, as the white mist which
                  intervened rolled away.</p>
               <p>The two buccaneer schooners still lay moored in the offing. As soon as the
                  atmosphere became clear, Blackbeard came cautiously forth from the secret crevice,
                  and endeavored by signals to attract the attention of some one of the crew of the
                  Raven or Shark, but all in vain. There were but two men on each deck, and they
                  seemed rather to watch the inlet than the craggy place where he stood. He then
                  ventured to ascend a high rock nearly above his head, one of the most commanding
                  points upon that side of the island. Here he obtained a long staff, and taking off
                  his jacket and appending it to the staff, he waved it above his head; but,
                  unluckily for him, it caught the eyes of several of his pursuers ere it did either
                  of those whose attention he wished to attract.</p>
               <p>"Huzza, boys! huzza!" shouted Gustave, a protegè of Red Martin, espying Blackbeard
                  upon the high rock. "There's our game! onward!"</p>
               <p>These shouts reached the quick ear of Blackbeard. He turned, and saw his hunters
                  approaching! His only hope to clude those by whom he was pursued, he thought, was
                  to clamber down the steep and to plunge into the ocean; but, again turning, he
                  paused—it would be certain destruction to any human being, who dared to venture on
                  so perilous a descent. He stood—undecided which way to flee. The hunters were
                  close upon him, ascending the rugged steep. Now was the moment for desperate
                  action if ever! With staff in hand he rushed directly towards his enemies—broke
                  through them, and gained the plain below ere they recovered their surprise at this
                  bold movement.</p>
               <p>But there were others on the alert, and the whole pack was immediately in full
                  cry.—Swift were the limbs of the fleeing pirate, and he was aware that life or
                  death depended upon his use of them. Could he reach the opposite shore of the
                  island, he could enter a cave, which he had discovered years before, and which was
                  unknown to any human being save himself. Away through orange groves, over plains
                  and hillocks, through tangled vines and grassy fields fled the desperate traitor,
                  hotly pursued. It was a chase of life and death—a sport and a duty where the
                  destined prey wore the form of a human being. No cunning fox, no timid doe, no
                  regal stag, was the object of the fierce pursuit. It was a man—one who was in the
                  full vigor of his strength, and one endowed with more than ordinary human
                  capacities—a man who felt that it required almost super-human exertion to save
                  himself from being captured by a foe he had determined to annihilate, and to avoid
                  a death of ignominy and torture!</p>
               <p>The pursuers, however, gained upon the traitor, and getting his feet tangled, he
                  fell headlong to the earth!</p>
               <p>The hunters raised a shout of exultation at this accident, for they felt that he
                  was now in their grasp.</p>
               <p>"Quick, comrades, quick!" shouted the foremost of the pursuers. "We have him now!
                  The wolf is caught!"</p>
               <p>But the exulting cry came too soon. The pursued pirate was again upon his feet,
                  and once more sped fleetly onward through bush and brake, and tangled thicket. For
                  a few moments the hunters lost sight of their determined prey, but they again
                  caught sight of him as he emerged from the thick grove. He reached a moss-grown
                  rock, and stood for a moment in bold defiance! Again he darted onward, uttering a
                  derisive shout, while the wild whoop of his adversaries sounded in his ears.
                  Before him was a thick forest, which if he could reach, he might baffle his
                  pursuers. He put forth his utmost energies—he tasked his muscles and strained his
                  muscles to their utmost, and succeeded. In a few moments he was again out of sight
                  of his resolute hunters, but they flagged not in the hot pursuit. Into the dark
                  forest of palms dashed the infuriated spirits—one<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000042"/> ward with fiercely-flashing eyes and rapid bounds.
                  Before them they heard the crackling of dry sticks beneath the outlaw's heavy
                  tread. Each moment the foremost of the pursuers imagined they descried his dark
                  figure flitting in a devious course through the shady grove. "On, on!" they
                  cried—"on to the death!"</p>
               <p>But Blackbeard had, for the time being, eluded them; he halted and crouched
                  beneath the wide spread leaves of an aloe. The hunters flew past him with a
                  courier's speed. All was now still—they knew not the direction of the wily
                  fugitive, nor the way they were themselves speeding, and they came to a sudden
                  halt.</p>
               <p>"Back—back!" cried one of the pursuers. "The ravenous wolf has concealed himself
                  in our rear! Be cautious, comrades, and vigilant, and we'll start him from his
                  covert!"</p>
               <p>"Which way?" hallooed Gustave.</p>
               <p>"This—this!" replied the first speaker, pointing back.</p>
               <p>Slowly, silently, and with keen eyes penetrating every thick and shady spot, the
                  pursuers retraced their steps. They had not proceeded but a few rods, when they
                  saw their game suddenly emerge from beneath the huge aloe, where he had concealed
                  himself, and dart again through the thicket.</p>
               <p>Once more did the island resound with the whoop and yells of the hunters. He
                  finally emerged from the wood near the spot where he had been driven into it! but
                  now he took a course more to the southward in the direction of the inlet, hoping
                  thereby to reach the channel, where, perchance, a boat from one of the schooners
                  might be a waiting his approach. He gained the summit of a small eminence; yet
                  farther was another ascent on the very verge of the cliff, but between the two
                  there was a rocky chasm difficult to pass, unless at a moderate speed. Blackbeard
                  on reaching the bottom of the chasm, saw his pursuers close at his heels; he
                  clambered up the opposite side, and stooping down, he disengaged a huge stone from
                  the loose earth, and sent it rolling down the steep, and ere it paused in its
                  rapid descent, it struck the foremost of the party, and sent his body to the foot
                  of the chasm a mangled corpse. A loud and hellish laugh of triumph was uttered by
                  Blackbeard, as he saw the effect of the huge missile. The hunters paused but a
                  moment to gaze upon their slain comrade, but fiercer than ever kept up the chase.
                  The fugitive gained the high cliff above the mouth of the channel, and lustily
                  hailed the men aboard the schooner.</p>
               <p>"Quick!—quick!—we have the hell-hound now!" cried Red Martin. "There is no way of
                  his escaping!"</p>
               <p>Blackbeard advanced to the very verge of the cliff, and for a moment seemed to
                  pause at the dreadful alternative. Almost certain death was before him, and a sure
                  death in his rear!</p>
               <p>"Fire upon him!" cried Gustave. "He intends to leap into the channel!"</p>
               <p>In the next moment a bullet from a carbine whizzed through the air and pierced
                  through his cap. He snatched it from his head, and flung it in a manner of
                  defiance towards his pursuers, who were now within six rods of him, eager to seize
                  their prey! But they were doomed to disappointment.</p>
               <p>Blackbeard stepped back a few paces—threw his arms forward—and rushing again to
                  the verge, gave a final spring, and took the fearful leap! In his fall he cleared
                  the jutting crags, and feet forward descended into the channel! The water being
                  deep, some moments elapsed ere he arose to the surface.—He was so benumbed by the
                  desperate leap, after the fatiguing and exciting chase, that, when he arose, he
                  had scarcely life enough to move his jaded limbs!</p>
               <p>"We'll have him yet!" cried Gustave. "He is too much exhausted to swim."</p>
               <p>But as he spoke, a light skiff, propelled by two lusty rowers from the Shark, came
                  darting up the narrow channel, aided by the swiftly-flowing tide.</p>
               <p>"Fire upon him!" shouted Red Martin from the cliff.</p>
               <p>In a moment more three or four carbines were simultaneously discharged; but the
                  order reaching the ears of the struggling Blackbeard, he sank quickly beneath the
                  surface, and came up several yards from the spot where the bullets struck.</p>
               <p>Presently the skiff came alongside, and ere the carbineers could reload their
                  pieces, the rowers had dropped their oars, lifted the daring, half-drowned
                  fugitive over the gunnels, and turned the prow of the light bark seaward. Away,
                  like a bird, down the swelling channel, scarcely seeming to touch the water, it
                  flew; now dancing over ripple and crest of wave; away through the splashing spray,
                  and the hissing, seething sea, fled the boat of the bold mutineers.</p>
               <p>Thus did Blackbeard finally escape from the clutches of the pirate chief, after
                  braving death in so many forms.</p>
               <p>The hunters looked upon each other with astonishment, when they saw how
                  miraculously their intended victim had escaped their grasp.</p>
               <p>Blackbeard immediately gave orders for both vessels to get underweigh and put to
                  sea. The crews of each had been so terribly decimated, he dared not attempt to
                  make an attack upon the island, and wreak his vengeance upon his mortal enemy; but
                  he determined to escape with the schooners, and cruise among the West India
                  Islands, make captures, and if possible, increase his armament, and obtain a full
                  complement of men of the right stamp. Then would he return to cope successfully<pb
                     n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6945-00000043"/> fully with his rival, and place the
                  beautiful island under his tyrannical dominion.</p>
               <p>Some time elapsed in weighing the anchors, making sail, and other preparations;
                  and before they were ready to direct their prows seaward, the Thunderbolt, fully
                  manned and equipped, was seen coming forth from the inlet. It was Red Martin's
                  object, knowing the present force of the two schooners, to give them immediate
                  battle. It being yet flood tide, the brigantine had to stem the setting in of a
                  swift current, giving time for Blackbeard with the Raven to get beyond the reach
                  of the Thunderbolt's gun. Not so fortunate was the Shark, though she had every
                  inch of her canvas spread, and followed in the wake of the Raven, by the time the
                  brigantine got fairly out of the channel. The chase now commenced in good earnest.
                  A fresh breeze was blowing, and the three vessels in a line skimmed over the seas
                  like so many white birds. Red Martin finding that he gained but slowly on the
                  Shark, ordered a long eighteen-pounder to be manned and shotted, and, if possible,
                  to cripple the fleeing vessel. Shot after shot was fired with but little effect.
                  At length hot shot was resorted to. With unerring aim several pierced her hull;
                  and flames and smoke were seen soon afterwards issuing from her hull. The crew
                  made an effort to quench the fire, but all in vain! They lowered the boats,
                  intending thereby to escape, or subject themselves to any death but that of being
                  destroyed by fire! Quickly did they leap from the deck into their last means of
                  safety; but before they could shove off from her side, a tremendous explosion
                  occurred, which startled even the ears of those who had caused it! The fire had
                  reached the powder magazine, and instantly the vessel and crew were blown to
                  atoms! Every soul on board was sent into eternity in one dreadful moment! The sea
                  far around was strewn with fragments of the vessel! The shattered hulk soon
                  settled into the water and was seen no more by mortal ken!</p>
               <p>From the quarter-deck of the Raven, unmoved and stern, stood that dark and
                  relentless man, Blackbeard, viewing the destruction of half his power, without the
                  thought entering his mind of running the slightest risk of his own life to save
                  those who acknowledged his power! He trembled not, his lips were firmly set, and
                  the expression of his countenance exhibited the utmost coolness when the terrific
                  explosion occurred!</p>
               <p>"Yah! yah! yah!" laughed a voice behind him, as soon as the roar of the shock was
                  heard, and turning, Blackbeard beheld Mungo, with grinning expression, looking
                  upon the scene.</p>
               <p>"Why do you laugh, you lump of lampblack?" demanded the pirate.</p>
               <p>"I was tinkin, massa, how I should lub to see de Tunderbolt sarbed de same sass!"
                  replied the negro.</p>
               <p>The truth was, Mungo had given vent to his joy on witnessing the destruction of
                  the Shark by the hand of his acknowledged master, and thereby had very nearly
                  betrayed his true feelings to his greatest enemy. His ready reply only saved
                  him.</p>
               <p>Blackbeard was now too far out of reach for Red Martin to overhaul him. The latter
                  considering the case hopeless, gave up the chase and returned to Virginia Gorda,
                  well satisfied with destroying half his enemy's force.</p>
               <p>Through the influence of Haidee, Red Martin resolved on abandoning, for a time at
                  least, the profession of buccaneering. With a portion of the Thunderbolt's
                  armament he resolved to so increase his fortifications that no power could sail up
                  the narrow channel with impunity. This accomplished, he would then turn his
                  attention to the cultivation of the island, and if possible, render Virginia Gorda
                  a substitute for that other island paradise which he had so often pictured to the
                  mind of Haidee, and which, according to a superstitious notion of hers, it was
                  destined he should never become the possessor of.</p>
               <p>For a few years, a frolicsome life did the buccaneers lead. Red Martin was the
                  King, and Haidee, the Queen of Virginia Gorda; and with so light a hand did they
                  rule their subjects, that the most hardy of the buccaneers became reconciled to
                  his most arbitrary law, viz.: that no person, under any circumstances, should be
                  allowed to leave the island; and the penalty for making such attempt was a summary
                  death.</p>
               <p>Captains Owen and Stark, Mrs. Bertine and daughter, besides three or four other
                  Americans, were yet held as prisoners, though in reality they had quite as much
                  liberty as Red Martin's subjects, and in all things regarding their comfort, they
                  were even better cared for.</p>
               <p>Haidee's chief delight was to be in the society of Mrs. Bertine, who, though she
                  sighed often for friends, home, and her lost husband, bore up against what seemed
                  to be her destined fate, and was comparatively happy. Oceana, her little darling,
                  who never wandered from her mother's side, grew in strength and beauty. She was
                  the cherished pet of every human being upon the island, and all seemed to esteem
                  it as a privilege to be near her, and hear her innocent prattle, and see her
                  childish pranks. No ribald jest, no profane expression, would be uttered when the
                  little Oceana was near. She seemed to exercise over those hard-hearted men almost
                  an angelic, a divine influence; her very sweetness and innocence would cause the
                  most callous heart to become softened and subdued in her presence. Diligently did
                  the fond parent strive to educate her child with<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000044"/> the slender means within her reach, and instill
                  into her rapidly expanding mind those truths which tend towards human
                  perfectibility. With joy she watched the continued success of her efforts; with
                  joy she beheld in her the semblance of its father. In that lovely, budding
                  offspring was a heaven of happiness!</p>

                     Death-plank.—Firmness of Bertine.—The dread Alternative.—A new Proposition.—The

               </argument>
               <p>TEN long years had elapsed since the occurrence of the wonderful flight and escape
                  of the relentless Blackbeard, before he felt that his force was sufficiently
                  powerful to carry into execution his long meditated enterprise; that of making an
                  attack upon Virginia Gorda, and seeking that revenge for which his soul thirsted.
                  During this period he had cruised on the coast of South America, in the Carribean
                  sea, and in the Gulf of Mexico, plundering and destroying every vessel that
                  chanced to fall in his way, and murdering their crews, not allowing a soul to
                  escape to tell the tale of his merciless barbarities.</p>
               <p>His power now consisted of two large clipper-built schooners, called the
                  "Avenger," and the "Triton." Their armament was heavy, and their equipments
                  complete; and each was manned by sixty as bold buccaneers as ever scuttled a ship.
                  Blackbeard commanded the Avenger, and Daredevil, his worthy compeer, the Triton.
                  The negro, Mungo, still held his post under the former, without being suspected of
                  having, in any manner, or at any time, betrayed him.</p>
               <p>It will be recollected by those who have thus far followed us in the course of our
                  narrative, that there were four prisoners taken by the pirates from the Admiral,
                  and transferred to the Raven; one of whom was Henri Bertine, who, at the time of
                  his capture, was attired in an ordinary sailor's garb; hence the reason of his not
                  having been taken aboard of the Thunderbolt, with Captain Stark, and those with
                  whom he was more dearly connected. Thus was the fond husband separated from his
                  wife; the latter believing him to have perished, and he supposing her to have been
                  murdered by the pirates.</p>
               <p>On the day subsequent to Blackbeard's escape in the Raven from the Thunderbolt, he
                  summoned the four prisoners who had been confined in chains since the capture, to
                  the deck under a strong guard. The death-plank had been rigged out on the weather
                  side of the schooner, and it needed no voice to explain to the condemned men for
                  what purpose. There was one among them, whose pale and emaciated features told a
                  tale of misery and woe. He started not back on beholding the awful preparations,
                  as did his comrades, for death had no terrors for him! Death was welcome in any
                  form!—he would embrace it without a single pang. This was the brave, the noble
                  Henri Bertine, the husband of Isabella, the father of Oceana.</p>
               <p>"Behold the death-plank!" said Blackbeard, addressing Bertine, as he saw no
                  symptoms of fear in the countenance of the young man.</p>
               <p>Bertine gazed steadily, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"It is hard that you should thus be cut off in the early years of manhood,"
                  continued the wretch.</p>
               <p>"What have I to live for?" at length essayed the condemned</p>
               <p>"For a long life and a merry one, among the independent rovers of the ocean!"</p>
               <p>"What!—turn pirate?" ejaculated Henri, indignantly.</p>
               <p>"That is your only alternative!"</p>
               <p>"I spurn your proposition as heartily as I do you!"</p>
               <p>"Be not rash, young man, standing as you are on the very brink of eternity! I
                  would save you and your three comrades. I have marked your indomitable courage,
                  and I like you for it. You shall have rank under me. Your comrades, too, shall
                  fare well."</p>
               <p>"Tempt me not, ruthless man!" replied Bertine. "Never will I consent, except in
                  defense, to shed one drop of human gore!"</p>
               <p>"I will not ask you to do even that," said Blackbeard. "You shall have posts that
                  will not bring you in contact with our enemies."</p>
               <p>"By Saint Dinnis!" said one of the prisoners, an Irishman, "I accipt the
                  gintleman's terms!"</p>
               <p>"So will I," added the second sailor.</p>
               <p>"And I," acquiesced the third.</p>
               <p>"Do as you please; but I WILL NOT!" exclaimed Bertine.</p>
               <p>"Then, by Pluto, all shall die!" said Blackbeard. "For your services alone did I
                  make the offer!"</p>
               <p>"Save us, Bertine!—oh! save us!" cried the sailors, in piteous accents.</p>
               <p>"Shame on you, men! Do ye fear Death? Are ye cowards?" ejaculated the courageous
                  man.</p>
               <p>Blackbeard perceiving that he had more eloquent pleaders than himself, said:</p>
               <p>"I give you five minutes' time to confer together.—Boatswain, leave these men to
                  themselves until I summon you."</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6945-00000045"/>
               <p>Thereupon Blackbeard went into the cabin, and the boatswain withdrew the
                  guard.</p>
               <p>As the guard disappeared into the forecastle, Mungo, the cunning negro, came forth
                  from the caboose, and whispered a few words in Henri's ear.</p>
               <p>"Merciful God! are you not deceiving me?" ejaculated Bertine, at the startling
                  intelligence communicated by Mungo.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" warned the negro. "Come dis way—I tellee you all 'bout um;" and he led the
                  surprised man a few steps apart from his comrades in difficulty.</p>
               <p>"Did you say that she was living?"</p>
               <p>"Ees, sah!"</p>
               <p>"And the child?"</p>
               <p>"Ees, sah! and de brave capun—I seed missee mesef, and de babby, too,—on de
                  islan—all well—all safe!"</p>
               <p>"But——"</p>
               <p>"Say nuffin now—I tellee you more some oder time—sabe your life for de sake ob de
                  wife and de babby. Better day cum bumby—Mungo 'll be good fren—no like old
                  Blackdebil—say nuffin ob dat, coz poor Mungo hab to trot de plank, too!"</p>
               <p>Uttering these words of consolation to the astonished Bertine, the sly Ethiopian
                  glided into the caboose just in time to escape the observation of his master, who
                  a moment afterwards appeared on the deck.</p>
               <p>"One revolution more of this second hand," said Blackbeard, gazing on the dial of
                  his watch, "and the die is cast! Your answer—have you concluded?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Bertine; "on the condition last named—on no other!"</p>
               <p>"You have my solemn promise which I will before my band proclaim on the first
                  occasion of their assembling—my oath could not be more binding"</p>
               <p>"Then, we are yours!" said the young man, almost bewildered with thoughts of those
                  dearly beloved ones, separated from him by a cruel fate. The bright star of hope,
                  though afar off, again beamed mildly upon him.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, thanks! noble Bertine!" cried the sailors, whose lives he had saved by
                  consenting to live himself.</p>
               <p>Blackbeard summoned the boatswain and guard, and said:</p>
               <p>"These men are ours!—off with their chains!—assign them comfortable quarters, and
                  my further pleasure in regard to them shall be made known in due time."</p>
               <p>Thus did Blackbeard gain over to the piratical crew his four prisoners; three of
                  whom afterwards became as desperate, inhuman, and bloody as any of his gang. But
                  not so with Bertine—he refused to listen to any overtures other than those by
                  which he had ransomed his life. He ever refused to take part in their murderous
                  business, and did only his duty as sailing-master, to which post he was promoted
                  soon after he had recovered his health and his energy, and in this capacity
                  Blackbeard found him so useful, that he overlooked what he termed a foolish
                  squeamishness, and would on no consideration have consented to part with him. And
                  for ten long years did Bertine suffer himself to look upon scenes of cruelty and
                  woe, but take part in them he could not and would not.</p>
               <p>At the lapse of the period named in the opening of this chapter, an incident
                  occurred which we here introduce, as it is an all-important link in the chain of
                  our story.</p>
               <p>A grand carousal was no uncommon thing by the pirate crews of Blackbeard,
                  particularly after the even of the capture of a rich prize; and on the occasion
                  which we now refer to,—a Spanish galleon having been captured, plundered of
                  treasures to an immense amount, her crew massacred, the ship scuttled and sunk.
                  Elated with unexpected success, the vessels were run into an unfrequented bay of
                  the Island of St. Christopher, where they were moored, for the purpose of having a
                  glorious revel. It was scarcely dark when the buccaneers commenced, and until
                  nearly midnight they made the evening hideous with their boisterous and frolicsome
                  mirth. One by one they reeled and staggered to the deck, until with but one or two
                  exceptions; aboard of each vessel they had become so basely intoxicated as to be
                  completely helpless. The Avenger's crew, if possible, were in a worse condition
                  than that of the Triton. Under this state of things, young Bertine who ever drank
                  sparingly, was requested by Blackbeard to act as officer of the Avenger's deck
                  during the night. He willingly complied, and three or four half-drunken sailors
                  were detained to act as watch under him. By the hour of midnight every man of them
                  was lying in a sound sleep, crouched together near the windlass.</p>
               <p>Now all was silence in that lonely bay, and to the mind of Henri Bertine who sat
                  on the quarter-deck, the scene was a solemn one. While he watched those bright and
                  serene sentinels of the sky, his thoughts wandered back to other and happier days,
                  when his companions wielded not blood-stained hands, and in comparison with those
                  in whose society he had passed the last ten years of his existence they were
                  angels, and worthy of esteem and love, instead of the absolute abhorrence he
                  entertained for the wretches with whom fate had doomed him. But uppermost in his
                  mind were those nearer and dearer allied to him—his beloved wife and child, from
                  whom he had been separated in an hour, when a husband's and a father's love and
                  protection were of more than ordinary necessity. He almost censured himself for
                  not having made efforts to free himself from a thraldom far worse than negro
                  slavery; it was not<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6945-00000046"/> only a slavery of the
                  body but of the conscience also. True, no feasible opportunity had ever presented
                  itself to ensure a successful escape; and had he made the attempt without success,
                  immediate death he well knew would have been his portion.</p>
               <p>For an hour or more was Bertine's mind busily employed in thoughts of the past,
                  and plans for the future. Now, it was suggested to him, that, had he the
                  co-operation of two individuals, or even of one, they might lower the boat and
                  make good their escape; for, once ashore, there would be little danger of pursuit,
                  inasmuch as they could flee to the port of Bassaterre, a distance of only five
                  miles—once there, all protection would be afforded.</p>
               <p>While indulging in this idea of escape, he was startled by the touch of a human
                  hand upon his shoulder. He suddenly turned, and beheld Mungo standing beside
                  him.</p>
               <p>So softly had the negro approached, even in that silent hour, that it was unheard
                  even by the quick ear of Bertine.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mungo!—'tis you!" said he. "Your sudden presence somewhat startled me; but
                  how is it, that you are not in the same condition of your comrades?"</p>
               <p>"Kase, massa, you no drink nuffin—Mungo drink nuffin—you sober—Mungo sober, too,"
                  was the negro's ready excuse for not getting drunk.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mungo, I think you are the only sober man aboard."</p>
               <p>"I tinks so myself, I duz—'cept you, massa—he, he, he, yah! Ole Blackdebil he moss
                  drunk, too!" declared the negro, elated at the thought.</p>
               <p>"Why, Mungo, did you leave your comfortable hammock at this hour of the night?"
                  asked Bertine.</p>
               <p>"Kase, Massa, Mungo want to sarbe you—now am de time!" answered the negro, in a
                  whisper.</p>
               <p>"For what?"</p>
               <p>"Your escape!"</p>
               <p>"That's not so easily done."</p>
               <p>"You can swim, massa?"</p>
               <p>"A little—a hundred yards perhaps—it is a half a league to the nearest point of
                  the shore."</p>
               <p>"Not quite dat, massa; but you won't hab to swim more dan tree lengths ob de
                  cable."</p>
               <p>"How do you make that out?"</p>
               <p>"Dat distance from de schooner 'tis no more dan tree feet—you walk nearly all de
                  way in de shoal water."</p>
               <p>"Are you certain of that, Mungo?"</p>
               <p>"As true as dis chile am a nigga. Ees, massa Bertine, I knows dis place well—a big
                  shark chase me here once—but he no kitch dis chile—me beat de ugly fish
                  swimmin'."</p>
               <p>"Perchance, if we should take a swim, another shark might be more successful."</p>
               <p>"Dar am no danger, massa—dis am not de time ob year for sharks to come up inter de
                  bay. Now 's de time, massa—I hab ben on de look-out for jess sich a chance for
                  you.—De tide is ebbin' now—in one hour de flats will all be bare."</p>
               <p>"Then will it be nearly time to call the morning watch?"</p>
               <p>"Den 't will all be over wid you—you muss not wait for dat."</p>
               <p>"But you will go, too, Mungo?" inquired Bertine.</p>
               <p>"No, massa, dat can't be—dat would be disobeyin' my true master's orders. I must
                  not leabe ole Blackdebil till his power am gone foreber!"</p>
               <p>"I understand, and will not urge you against your will; but to go myself I am
                  resolved. In which direction, Mungo, shall I soonest reach shallow water?"</p>
               <p>"I show you—follow Mungo."</p>
               <p>"Then you have changed your mind, and will accompany me, my honest friend?" said
                  Bertine, inquiringly, and elated at the idea of having Mungo's company.</p>
               <p>"I lead de way to de shoal water—but no farder. Come, dar am n't a moment's time
                  to lose."</p>
               <p>Uttering these words, the negro lowered a portion of a coil of rigging over the
                  taffrail, and making it fast to a bolt, he climbed noiselessly over the rail, and
                  slipped noiselessly into the water. Bertine immediately followed his ebony friend.
                  Mungo forthwith struck out for the western shore, and after swimming less than the
                  distance he had named, the negro halted and stood upright in the water several
                  minutes before Bertine came up.</p>
               <p>"Dar, massa, wot I tellee you?"</p>
               <p>"You were right, Mungo; and now, how shall I re——"</p>
               <p>"You see dat tall cocoa-nut tree yender on de high hill?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mungo."</p>
               <p>"Steer for dat tree fass as your legs will tote you; de water will be less and
                  less as you come to de shore."</p>
               <p>"But, my worthy friend, how am I to repay you for this no——"</p>
               <p>"When you hab arribed at de big cocoa-nut tree," again interrupted the negro, "you
                  den make tracks for Bassaterre."</p>
               <p>"Be my companion, Mungo, and you shall never lack my friendship, and never want
                  for——"</p>
               <p>"Tank you, massa; Mungo know his duty;" once more interrupted the faithful negro,
                  and reaching out his hand, he said, while tears started from his eyes—"good bye,
                  Massa Bertine—'member poor Mungo—God bress you, whereber you go."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Mungo!—and——"</p>
               <p>The negro tarried to hear no more, but plunging forward, darted toward the
                  schooner like a dolphin, leaving Bertine to<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6945-00000047"
                  /> pursue his watery way alone towards the shore. The bottom was quite hard, and
                  as he proceeded it grew more shallow. In half an hour he once more stood on
                  terra-firma; and, though fatigued, he climbed the hill and travelled onward toward
                  the port of Bassaterre.</p>
               <p>Mungo reached the schooner in safety, and after changing his scanty wardrobe, he
                  ran into the cabin, where Blackbeard was profoundly sleeping, and awoke him.</p>
               <p>"What's wanting, Mungo?" demanded the pirate captain.</p>
               <p>"I tink, massa," said the negro, appearing very much frightened, "dat somebody hab
                  fallen oberboard, and drown hesef!"</p>
               <p>"How know you that?" asked Blackbeard, as he rushed upon deck, with Mungo
                  following closely at his heels.</p>
               <p>"I heard de splash, an de cry ob de drownin' man—den I heard nuffin."</p>
               <p>"Why didn't you leap overboard, and try to save him?"</p>
               <p>"Kase Mungo drown, too—massa know Mungo no swim!"</p>
               <p>"Who can it be?"</p>
               <p>"Mungo didn't know de voice!"</p>
               <p>"But how's this?" ejaculated Blackbeard, after he had traversed the deck. "What!
                  no watch on deck? By h—l! somebody shall pay dearly for this!" he threatened,
                  greatly enraged.</p>
               <p>"Dere am tree dead drunk men at de winlass, massa—dey be de watch, yah!"</p>
               <p>"The damn'd villains!" he exclaimed, rushing towards them. "The drunken wretches
                  shall keep watch in hell hereafter!" and drawing his sabre, he stabbed to the
                  heart every one of those miserable beings! Each uttered his death groan, and their
                  guilty souls were summoned to the infernal regions, whither their satanic master
                  of earth had declared his intention of sending them.</p>
               <p>"Throw those carcases overboard, Mungo!" commanded the rash captain.</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa," replied the negro; and he quickly performed the task.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mungo," resumed Blackbeard, "where's the officer of the deck, Mr.
                  Bertine?"</p>
               <p>"Habn't seen him since lass night, massa capen."</p>
               <p>"Go to his state-room and call him to the deck—instantly!"</p>
               <p>"Ees, sah!" replied the negro, as he started off to obey his master; but in less
                  than a minute he returned with the report that he was neither in his state-room,
                  nor in the main cabin!</p>
               <p>"Was he, too, intoxicated, last night?" asked Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa—arter you go below, he get drunk as de berry debil!"</p>
               <p>"Then it must have been Bertine who fell overboard!"</p>
               <p>"Ees, massa, now I tink ob it, dat voice did sound like his."</p>
               <p>"Then is he drowned!" said Blackbeard, soliloquizing. "Poor Bertine—he had many
                  great qualities—he was a good officer; and though he was no true corsair, I could
                  have better spared any other man of the fleet!"</p>
               <p>Turning to Mungo, he said,—</p>
               <p>"Call up the morning watch!"</p>
               <p>This having been done, Blackbeard, after giving several unimportant orders,
                  returned to his couch, and fell asleep, as though nothing of importance had
                  occurred.</p>
               <p>Mungo imitated his master, and crawled into his hammock, but he could not so
                  readily persuade himself to sleep, for he was too much elated with the success of
                  his cunning adventure to quiet his excited nerves.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>LET us now for a time follow the adventures of him who had in so singular a
                  manner, escaped from the pirate crew, after having been in a state of
                  semi-bondage, for nearly a dozen of years.</p>
               <p>Before the sun reddened the eastern sky, on the morning which followed his escape,
                  Henry Bertine, almost exhausted with fatigue, entered a sailor's boarding house,
                  in the ancient town of Bassaterre. He applied for a lodging; it was granted him,
                  and he retired to rest, and soon fell into a profound slumber, from which he did
                  not awake until at a late hour in the afternoon. He then arose, sauntered through
                  the town, and down to the quay. There was quite a fleet of vessels of different
                  nations in the harbor, and from the mast-head of one floated the Star Spangled
                  Banner.—With feelings of joy and pride he beheld the ensign of his own native
                  land—his home, from which he had long been a stranger and an unwilling outlaw.</p>
               <p>He was almost destitute of money, having but few maravedis left after paying his
                  landlord for his lodging and some refreshments. The poor coins he gave to a
                  boatman, to take him off to the vessel he had espied out, which was riding at
                  anchor nearly half a mile distant from the quay. The boat was rowed alongside, and
                  he ascended the gangway-stairs to the step.</p>
               <p>"Is the captain of this brig aboard?" he inquired of a boy, the only person upon
                  the deck.</p>
               <p>"Captain Starling's below, sir," replied the boy.</p>
               <p>"I beg the privilege of speaking with him," said Bertine.</p>
               <p>The boy entered the cabin, and in a few moments the captain, a good-natured
                  specimen of a Yankee sailor, appeared at the companion-way.</p>
               <p>"If not impertinent, sir," said Bertine, approaching, "I would inquire if this
                  brig is home-ward bound?"</p>
               <p>"If ever I succeed in shipping a complement of men, I shall be off out of this.
                  Two of my crew have deserted me," replied the captain.</p>
               <pb n="99" xml:id="VAC6945-00000049"/>
               <p>deep shadows were never more joyfully welcomed by man, than by Captain Starling
                  and his crew.</p>
               <p>Morning came, and not a speck was visible upon the ocean from the brig. She had
                  changed her course during the night, and thus eluded the ravenous wolves, which at
                  that period scoured the ocean in every direction.</p>
               <p>In fifteen days the brig arrived in Boston harbor, and Bertine, after accepting
                  the thanks of the owners, accompanied by a substantial present for the services he
                  had rendered Captain Starling, who had the magnanimity to give Bertine the whole
                  credit of saving the brig.</p>
               <p>On the following day he entered the town whence he had sailed fourteen years
                  previously. None there were that recognized him, for he was much changed; and few
                  only remained who remembered him when he made himself known. The Indiaman, on
                  which he was a passenger, was supposed to have foundered at sea, and that all on
                  board had perished. He remained but a few days, for he found not that sympathy
                  among his wealthy connexions that he anticipated, but among his poor relations he
                  found sympathy, but they were too poor to aid him in an enterprise he had
                  projected. Baffled in his expectations in his native town, he set out for
                  Washington—After a time he succeeded in getting an interview with the Secretary of
                  the Navy, to whom he related his singular adventures. His description of
                  Blackbeard's force brought forcibly to the mind of the official the many rumors he
                  had from time to time heard respecting this noted pirate; and before Bertine had
                  finished his narrative he inwardly resolved to do all in his power towards the
                  fitting out of a proper expedition, to be sent against the noted buccaneer. The
                  result was, that, after three months' delay, a corvette was put in trim for this
                  service, at the Gosport Navy Yard, and placed in the command of a very young and
                  gallant officer. Bertine would accept of no commission, preferring to go only as a
                  passenger, and act as the adviser of the young commander, whose implicit
                  confidence he had already won. Her peculiar service was not made known until she
                  had fairly got to sea. When it was announced, the crew gave three hearty cheers,
                  as an expression of their hearty approbation of the cause in which they were
                  enlisted.</p>

                     Sails.—Blackbeard's Arrival off Virginia Gorda.—Preparations for Defence.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONCE more, patient reader, with lightning-like dispatch, we shall carry you back
                  to the isle of the pirates, Virginia Gorda. Though fourteen long years have winged
                  their rapid flight into the oblivious past; though the island was inhabited during
                  this period by some whose names were never profaned by a corsair's infamy, yet but
                  little or no change had been made in its external appearance. It looked to the
                  mariner as dangerous and as inhospitable as any rocky excrescence upon the ocean;
                  and for this reason none sought to explore or even to attempt a landing upon
                  it.</p>
               <p>Red Martin and Haidee still reigned supreme; but through the influence of that
                  strong-minded woman, the Buccaneer Chief had wholly abandoned the diabolical
                  profession he had for so many years pursued. Each year during the period named he
                  had made it a practice to visit several of the ports on the coast of South
                  America, in the character of a merchant, for the sole purpose of purchasing
                  luxuries and necessary supplies for the people of the island over which he claimed
                  sovereignty. These voyages were made in the Thunderbolt, which had been re-named
                  and re-modelled, so that her former character could not have been readily
                  recognized. He sailed with no armament, and with but few men, and was generally
                  recognized by those with whom he traded, as a wealthy merchant from one of the
                  Spanish West-India ports.</p>
               <p>The prisoners of Red Martin—or rather his forced subjects—had the freedom of the
                  island, but were not allowed to leave it, and no inducement could gain his consent
                  to permit a single individual, excepting of his original band, to accompany him on
                  his annual voyages. The only point of egress or ingress was kept, strictly
                  guarded.—The prisoners, however, had every other liberty which any of Red Martin's
                  old subjects claimed, and they all lived such a life of luxury and ease that it
                  was by no means insupportable.</p>
               <p>The face of the island, notwithstanding their indolence, constantly improved. It
                  was one of nature's gardens, and it teemed with fruits and flowers, spices and
                  nuts, and every luxury of the clime. The greatest changes, however, were visible
                  in that small community. Red Martin had lost the power and vigor of manhood, and
                  with it much of his ambition. Haidee was now a noble robust-looking woman of forty
                  years. Captain Stark was well nigh a septuagenarian, while Captain Owen was his
                  junior only by a few years. Their dark hair had changed to a silvery whiteness,
                  and the deep wrinkles in their cheeks and foreheads indicated that they were "in
                  the sere and yellow leaf." Isabella Bertine, though some thirty five years of age,
                  retained almost the bloom of those years, when she reigned as the belle of a New
                  England village. She was, indeed, a handsome specimen of a matron lady, such a one
                  as the most distinguished might well be proud of. But what shall we say of her
                  daughter—the child of the ocean—the "Virgin of the Islet," Oceana Bertine. If true
                  beauty ever visits this sublunary sphere in female guise, it was made manifest in
                  that fair being whose cradle was rocked by the billows of the ocean, and whose
                  first hours in this world were amid scenes of carnage and deadly strife. Her
                  loveliness was not heightened by accomplishments, and presented not those dazzling
                  points of attraction which blaze for a season and then grow dim. She was not made
                  to shine in the crowded assembly, the cynosure of all eyes. She was far better
                  fitted for a conservatory of Flora's gifts to earth, the silent dell, the shady
                  grove, or the domestic fire-side—for Oceana was Nature's child, unadorned by art
                  or fashion. Her gentle, loving soul was made eloquently apparent in her
                  softly-flashing, mildly-beaming eyes of ocean-blue; while the tender sentiments of
                  her unsophisticated heart were expressed in every action of her agile and
                  symmetrical form, and in every sentence which fell from her sweet cherry lips.
                  Graceful as Titania in her movements, her figure presented that lightness of
                  mould, in which artists depict the fairy beings of their imaginations.—Her
                  features were delicately moulded, softly chiselled, and sweetly expressive. Her
                  hair was of a light color, but of that beautiful hue which conveys the idea of
                  sun-beams woven into tresses. Pearly and clear was her complexion, but upon her
                  cheeks the many shades of the rose rested, varying in their depth with each
                  passing emotion of their soul. In her society, young as she was, all hearts were
                  captivated—none could resist the gentle influence of the Virgin of the Islet. Amy,
                  too, had a voice like the Nightingale; the pretty ballads, which had been taught
                  by her mother, she sang so expressively and so sweetly, that even the birds were
                  charmed with her delicious warblings. Those who<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6945-00000051"/> have listened to the flute-like voice of the
                  Swedish Nightingale, can form, perhaps, an idea of the syren notes of the girlish
                  maiden of Virginia Gorda. Such was Oceana Bertine, the heroine of our "plain,
                  unvarnished tale."</p>
               <p>It was at the hour of sunset, of a lovely eve in May, that Oceana, in company with
                  her mother, Captain Owen and his daughter Amy, Charles Thorburn—whom we have not
                  quite lost sight of—together with the venerable Captain Stark, had rambled from
                  their quarters to the highest bluff of the island, for the purpose of enjoying the
                  salubrious sea-breeze, and to witness the gorgeous scene of a sunset in the ocean.
                  Just as the golden orb had made its magnificent exit, two vessels were descried
                  near the western horizon by Oceana, who immediately exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Mother, I see two sails which look like a pair of white birds! How prettily they
                  look—the sun's rays just tip their masts with a golden light!"</p>
               <p>"Sails!" ejaculated Captain Stark. "I see not even a speck."</p>
               <p>"Look, in that direction," said Oceana, pointing with her taper finger toward the
                  glowing western horizon.</p>
               <p>The old captain strained his eyes in the direction named.</p>
               <p>"I see now, my child; and sure enough, they are a pretty sight. Tell me, darling,
                  what is their course? These top-lights of mine are getting rather hazy."</p>
               <p>"Oh! they must be sailing this way, for they grow larger each moment," replied the
                  girl. "I hope they are coming here to take us to that New England home which you
                  so often have told me about, mother!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! my daughter, that is too much to hope!" replied Mrs. Bertine, while a tear
                  glistened upon the matron's cheek.</p>
               <p>"What a happy day, my dear Amy, that would be for us!" said Charles Thorburn,
                  aside, to Amy Owen. "Then would our happiness be consummated."</p>
               <p>"Don't speak so loudly, Charles," said his betrothed; "my father has sharp ears,
                  and he won't permit us to talk of such things, you know."</p>
               <p>"Captain Owen," said Stark, "do you perceive those vessels?"</p>
               <p>"Very distinctly, and they are bearing down for this island," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"That is an unusual course for any craft now-a-days," resumed Captain Owen.</p>
               <p>By this time their hulls had begun to loom from the ocean's surface, and soon
                  became quite distinct.</p>
               <p>"Whether for good or for evil, unless they change their course, they will soon be
                  nearer the island than I ever saw a vessel before, excepting that which brought us
                  hither," observed Captain Owen.</p>
               <p>"True, my friend," replied Stark; "and they wouldn't be bearing down before the
                  wind, unless their destination was here. Oceana," he continued, turning to the
                  girlish maiden, "can you distinguish any thing upon their decks?"</p>
               <p>"Oceana placed her open hand over her eye to screen it from the bright red
                  horizon, and gazed intently upon the strange vessels for a few moments.</p>
               <p>"I see," said she, at length, "men moving to and fro."</p>
               <p>"Do you perceive many?"</p>
               <p>"Six or seven on one, and as many more on another, if my eyes do not deceive me,"
                  she answered;—" and now I can see a row of guns!"</p>
               <p>"Guns! are you sure?" ejaculated Stark, surprised.</p>
               <p>"I am quite certain, sir!" she replied.</p>
               <p>"Guns!" he repeated, turning to Captain Owen, with an enquiring gaze; "these are
                  armed schooners?"</p>
               <p>"So I have been thinking," said Owen; "and it is my opinion they are pirates!"</p>
               <p>"My mind exactly!" said Stark. "They are Red Martin's old enemies, I'm
                  convinced!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile this conversation was taking place, Red Martin, and several of his old
                  followers, had been watching the approach of the two vessels from the bluff at the
                  inlet, where his formidable battery was planted.</p>
               <p>With the aid of a glass the Chief had readily made out the character of the
                  approaching vessels. He knew that his old compeer in crime, but now deadly enemy,
                  Blackbeard, was coming to seek his promised revenge, and if possible to wrest the
                  island from his power. Already had he commenced making preparations to give them a
                  warm reception. The guns of the battery were double-shotted, and piles of
                  ammunition, of which he had an almost inexhaustible store in his magazine, were
                  collected at a convenient distance from the battery. Every available man upon that
                  sea-girt isle was summoned to the only possible point of attack, and they were
                  protected by an almost impregnable wall of masonry with every facility of working
                  the guns, which were mounted on carriages, and pointed through port-holes.</p>
               <p>If Red Martin lacked any thing to defend the island from any force that could be
                  brought against it, it was men; some of whom were well-nigh superannuated, and his
                  entire force of effective men did not exceed thirty in all, a part of these having
                  been brought from the ports in South America, which he had from time to time
                  visited in a mercantile capacity. His prisoners he had not yet summoned in this
                  pending emergency, and he was<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6945-00000052"/> not fully
                  assured that they would co-operate with him in repelling the invaders. Haidee was
                  sent to confer with them. She met them coming towards the fortified point.</p>
               <p>"If I mistake not," said Captain Stark, addressing the heroic woman, "your old
                  enemy, Blackbeard, comes!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and to butcher us all, should he overpower us!" she replied.</p>
               <p>"And if I guess aright, you have come for our assistance?" inquired Stark.</p>
               <p>"That is my errand!" replied Haidee; "for the sake of your life, and the lives of
                  your friends, you cannot hesitate as to your duty. We do not ask you to fight for
                  us, who have so long held you in an easy captivity, but to fight against those who
                  would enslave or murder you. You know the incentive which sends that hellish
                  monster, Blackbeard, here. 'Tis not merely conquest, though that would follow, but
                  bloody revenge!"</p>
               <p>"We have already decided to fight for you," replied Stark; "not for Red Martin's
                  sake—not for ours wholly—but for those of your sex who share our captivity; and,
                  also, to show our gratitude to you, who have done so much to alleviate our sorrows
                  during a long series of years!"</p>
               <p>"Thanks—thanks—for your good will towards us!" replied Haidee; "Martin and his men
                  you will find at the battery!"</p>
               <p>Saying this, she hurried on after the females, who, considerably alarmed, had
                  taken flight towards their quarters.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE shades of evening were fast deepening. There was no moon, but the brilliant
                  constellations of the southern hemisphere never shone out with more dazzling
                  brightness. The wind had gradually died away, until only soft zephyrs ruffled the
                  surface of the sea. All was silent, save the dull roar of the long ground swells
                  as they broke one after another upon that rugged shore.</p>
               <p>Silently, slowly and steadily, approached those strange vessels towards the
                  island, their course being directed with unerring precision to the entrance of its
                  only known channel. At length, one by one, the foresails, topsails, and
                  top-gallantsails, were furled, until only mainsails and staysails gave motion to
                  the schooners. When they had arrived within a few cables' length of the channel's
                  mouth, they dropped anchor. Immediately afterwards a boat left the inner vessel,
                  manned by ten stout oarsmen and a coxswain; they floated noiselessly up the
                  channel, resting upon their oars, evidently for the purpose of reconnoitring the
                  position of things upon the island; for Blackbeard was in doubt whether Red
                  Martin, or any one else, inhabited Virginia Gorda. The boat was eagerly watched by
                  the pirate captain from his quarter-deck, as it proceeded up the inlet. It had
                  neared within twenty yards of the bluff, when one of the guns belched forth a
                  sheet of flame, and a shower of iron hail which dealt death and destruction to
                  that boat's crew! Not one escaped! and the boat was shattered into a thousand
                  pieces!</p>
               <p>Blackbeard, when he saw the terrible effect of that one discharge, raved and
                  cursed like a madman, and swore that he would force his way into the basin, though
                  opposed by a legion of demons! He forthwith summoned his subordinate officers to
                  the cabin to decide upon a plan of attack, the result of which was, that the
                  "Triton," under Daredevil, should sail up the channel, and make an attack upon the
                  battery with all the guns he could bring to bear upon it, while two boats' crews
                  should endeavor to force their way up, and make a landing under cover<pb
                     n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6945-00000053"/> er of the Triton's cannonading. The
                  Avenger, so soon as a landing could be effected by the boats' crews, was to go up
                  the channel, pass the Triton, and if possible force her way into the inlet, where
                  the guns of the battery could not be turned against her, thereby giving an
                  opportunity for the men to land, and then to overpower the island. It was a bold
                  project, as all admitted, and Blackbeard, in his extreme wrath, resolved to hazard
                  all in the rash attempt.</p>
               <p>It was near the midnight hour when the Triton got under weigh to lead in the
                  desperate adventure. A breeze had sprung up during the night, and under mainsail
                  and jib she sailed for the channel and bore up in a fine style. Only a sufficient
                  number of pirates were on deck to manage the craft and work her guns. Half the
                  distance was gained before a gun was fired. Three or four of the heaviest pieces
                  now opened upon the battery, and was promptly returned upon the exposed vessel,
                  doing considerable damage to the sails and rigging, and wounding several of the
                  pirates. The cannonading now became general on both sides, and death and carnage
                  strewed the Triton's deck. Under cover of the dense smoke, the two boats shot off
                  for the shore, but in their passage one became stove, the other reached the shore,
                  and twelve bold buccaneers effected a landing, yet they were kept at bay by huge
                  missiles which were hurled down upon them!</p>
               <p>While this was going on, another terrific scene was being enacted outside the
                  channel, which struck terror to the hearts of the piratical besiegers!</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the Avenger weighed anchor, when a vessel, under full sail, was
                  descried bearing down upon her. Blackbeard was amazed, for he saw that it was an
                  armed corvette, with the Banner of Stars floating proudly from the main peak!
                  while at his own mast head waved the bloody flag of the Corsair! Here was a
                  dilemma, unexpected as it was fearful! To escape was impossible! To fight was the
                  only alternative! He shouted forth his orders in thunder-tones! and bade the men
                  to fight for their lives! Death or victory was their cry!</p>
               <p>As the corvette neared, she shortened sail, and hove-to in gallant style,
                  presenting her larboard battery to the Avenger, and saluting her by a broadside!
                  The shot told well—the schooner's mainmast went by the board—the fore top-mast was
                  carried away—and her bulwarks were considerably shattered!</p>
               <p>Blackbeard shouted to his gunners to return the fire! The matches were applied to
                  the vent, but, to the consternation of the pirates, no explosion followed!</p>
               <p>"The guns are spiked!—the guns are spiked!" cried the gunners.</p>
               <p>"Hell and furies!" cried Blackbeard, rushing from the quarter-deck ter-deck among
                  the men, in a great rage. "Show me the villain who did this, and I'll quarter him
                  alive!"</p>
               <p>"I suspect that infernal nigger, Mungo!" answered one of the pirates.</p>
               <p>A moment afterwards a splash was heard in the water directly under the stern.</p>
               <p>"'Twas he! the villain's leaped overboard!" exclaimed one of the pirates.</p>
               <p>"Shoot him! curse him—shoot him! On your lives don't let that d——d traitorous dog
                  escape!" cried Blackbeard.</p>
               <p>Several loaded carbines were seized by the pirates, and they ran to the
                  quarter-deck to fire upon Mungo—for he it was who had committed the bold deed—but
                  there was nothing visible on the water's surface!"</p>
               <p>"Poor devil! he's drowned!—he couldn't swim!" said one of the men.</p>
               <p>"There he is!—there he is!—he swims like a porpoise!" cried another, as Mungo came
                  to the surface to breathe the more vital element of air.</p>
               <p>Three or four carbines were discharged, but they were a little late—for he was too
                  cunning to make his head a target for more than one moment. After swimming a few
                  yards farther he again came up, but the amphibious black had gained too great a
                  distance from the schooner to be observed by those who watched for him. Mungo
                  reached the corvette—clambered up the gangway—and, running to the quarter-deck,
                  fell upon his knees at the feet of the first officer he met.</p>
               <p>"What black apparition's this?" demanded the young commander, startled at the
                  negro's singular appearance.</p>
               <p>"Mercy! sabe poor Mungo! me spike ole Blackdebil's guns, so he no shoot you!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! I now understand why the devils don't return our fire!" said Commander
                  Pierson.</p>
               <p>"By all that's merciful!" exclaimed Bertine, who now appeared on deck, "if I am
                  not greatly deceived, this is my old and faithful friend, Mungo!"</p>
               <p>"Goddee bressee you, Massa Bertin! I know'd it was you, I did, as true as dis
                  nigga am alibe!" exclaimed Mungo, dancing round him in great glee. "Huzza!
                  huzza!"</p>
               <p>"Captain Pierson, this faithful man once saved my life, and he it was who enabled
                  me to escape from the service of the buccaneers!" said Bertine, who was quite as
                  much elated as the negro.</p>
               <p>"I know'd dem stars and stripes, Massa Bertine," said the happy Ethiopian. "I
                  know'd dey belong to your country! I know'd dis vessel cum to fight ole
                  Blackdebil—I tought you'd come, too—so I help you—spile his fightin'—den I swim
                  ober here!"</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6945-00000054"/>
               <p>"You're a brave fellow, and shall be well cared for!" said Commander Pierson.</p>
               <p>The pirates had, in the meantime, made every preparation for a desperate
                  resistance, should the Americans attempt to board. In case they attempted to
                  batter her to pieces or sink her with heavy shot, Blackbeard determined to abandon
                  the schooner in the two boats, and, if possible, run up the channel to assist
                  Daredevil.</p>
               <p>The captain of the corvette, as she neared the pirate, saw a greater number of
                  men, well armed, on her deck, than he had reason to suppose.</p>
               <p>"Bear up a little!" said he to the helmsman: "we must strive to sweep her deck
                  with a dose of grape, before we come to close quarters with those desperate
                  fellows!"</p>
               <p>Three or four guns were charged with grape shot, and when the corvette came within
                  ordinary musket-shot distance, Pierson gave the order to fire!</p>
               <p>The guns belched forth a shower of shot that was fearfully effective! When the
                  cannon's roar subsided, the most hideous and frightful yells were heard,
                  proceeding from the pirate crew! Death and carnage strewed the Avenger's deck.</p>
               <p>"Now, away! briskly!" cried Pierson to the helmsman. "Prepare to board!" he
                  shouted to the men forward.</p>
               <p>So horrible were the slaughter and confusion aboard the Avenger, that they thought
                  not of their boats, until the corvette had ranged alongside, and her crew, by
                  dozens, had leaped upon her deck! The surviving pirates, maddened to desperation,
                  fought like so many demons, and for a long time they yielded not a foot to their
                  enemy.</p>
               <p>But the tide of battle was soon in favor of that Yankee crew. In the very midst of
                  the raging conflict, when the pirates were dealing deadly blows, Henri Bertine,
                  attired and armed in a like manner as when sailing-master of the Avenger, suddenly
                  rushed through the Americans, and appeared before those very men with whom he had
                  been an unwilling associate.</p>
               <p>The pirates started back aghast! They believed him dead! and they were
                  superstitious enough to suppose that this was his spirit! But when they saw all,
                  who had the temerity to oppose him, fall beneath his heavy blows, they thought
                  that naught but flesh and blood could so wield a weapon of steel! He cut his way
                  through their ranks, for he espied his formidable archenemy in their
                  rear!—Blackbeard had recognized him, and at once penetrated the mystery of the
                  sudden appearance of the corvette in that strange and dangerous place.</p>
               <p>"Traitor! though I be conquered, thy death is certain!" said Blackbeard, as their
                  sabres clashed, and crossed each other, while they stood firmly, and gazing with
                  all the hatred each had power to express.</p>
               <p>"Fiend of hell!" exclaimed Bertine, "I come now for vengeance! I risk all upon
                  this trusty blade!"</p>
               <p>"And I will try the virtue of this!" said Blackbeard, snatching with his left hand
                  a pistol from his belt, and aiming it at Bertine's breast!</p>
               <p>Quick as thought, he forced back his antagonist's blade, and with a stroke of his
                  own, he struck off the hand which held the pistol, and both fell to the deck!</p>
               <p>Blackbeard uttered one wild shriek of pain, and rushed upon his antagonist with a
                  tiger-like ferocity! But his strength failed gradually, as his life's blood oozed
                  out of his handless arm! The bloody buccaneer reeled and staggered, at the same
                  time cutting and thrusting with uncertain aim! Bertine followed up his advantage,
                  and wrenched his adversary's weapon from his hand! Another blow, and the head of
                  the demoniac Blackbeard rolled upon that bloody deck!</p>
               <p>The conflict aboard the Avenger was now at an end. According to his vow, each
                  pirate fought to the last gasp!</p>
               <p>Bertine seized a boarding-pike, and thrusting it into the mouth and through the
                  skull of the head he had cleaved from its trunk, he held it up to the gaze of the
                  victorious Americans!</p>
               <p>"Behold!" said he, "the head of the veriest wretch, that ever encumbered earth or
                  ocean! The noted sea-robber, Kidd, was a child in gentleness and humanity,
                  compared with the demon, Blackbeard!"</p>
               <p>It was now near the dawn of day, and preparations were immediately made on board
                  of the corvette to run up the channel, which had been pointed out to the
                  sailing-master by the negro, Mungo, who had also imparted to Pierson, the whole of
                  Blackbeard's original plan of operations to overpower the force ashore, and to
                  possess himself of the island and its treasures!</p>
               <p>The scene at the battery had been quite as desperate as the action in the offing,
                  and was yet raging. Daredevil, finding that it was but a useless waste of
                  ammunition and men, to make further efforts to silence the guns of the besieged,
                  or to make a breach in the rocky rampart which afforded them protection, forced
                  the Triton, despite the constant discharge of heavy shot upon her, up into the
                  inlet so far, that not a single gun could be brought upon her. Like so many
                  devils, goaded to desperation, the buccaneers leaped ashore, and commenced
                  clambering up the rocky steep, where so many of their comrades had already bitten
                  the dust, by heavy missiles which had been hurled upon them!</p>
               <p>Red Martin, notwithstanding he had fallen somewhat into the "sere and yellow
                  leaf," battled manfully, and many a besieger paid dearly for his temerity by
                  opposing him; but, finally, he was disarmed, and a heavy blow of a cutlass felled
                  him to the ground.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6945-00000055"/>
               <p>The island prisoners defended the battery like men of true courage. Captain
                  Stark—veteran as he was—seemed to be in his element; for he fought with a lion's
                  courage, and with a lion's strength. But the handful of men now remaining, could
                  not have held long out against the numbers and fury of the besiegers, had they not
                  been reinforced from an unexpected source.</p>
               <p>At the most critical juncture, Haidee suddenly appeared, followed by half a dozen
                  other women, attired in male costume, and armed with swords and pistols! This
                  little Amazonian band boldly made their appearance on the ramparts, from which the
                  besiegers had been driven as often as they mounted it; but now they were
                  clambering up in greater numbers, and victory looked doubtful.</p>
               <p>The moment they again gained a footing upon the wall, the females discharged their
                  pistols; then, drawing their light sabres, they rushed upon them, and succeeded in
                  nearly clearing the ramparts. Several desperate fellows remained; one of whom
                  engaged Haidee in single combat. He was the man who had struck down her husband,
                  and was a skilful swordsman. She parried his heavy blows and thrusts with a
                  dexterity which quite amazed her antagonist; and when, at length, he made an
                  unlucky pass, she twisted the weapon from his hand—another moment, and he fell
                  upon a heap of slain.</p>
               <p>The sun arose upon that scene of blood, yet the conflict raged, and the besiegers
                  were obstinate to the last. Each one of them appeared not to fight for victory,
                  but merely to sell his life as dearly as possible.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the corvette had run up to the inlet, taken possession of the Triton and
                  exterminated every man that they found aboard of her. A strong detachment, headed
                  by Bertine, then went ashore, and hastened to aid those who still retained
                  possession of the battery; but before they could climb to the summit of the bluff,
                  the victory was won!—and the youngest of that Amazonian band stood on the rampart
                  waving in triumph a white silken flag, with a blushing rose engraved upon its
                  centre.</p>
               <p>Bertine was the first man who gained the battery.</p>
               <p>"Ah! whom have we here?" he ejaculated. "My old friend, Captain Stark! God be
                  praised!"</p>
               <p>"You have the advantage of me," replied the Captain; "but as you sail under yon
                  glorious banner of stars, I claim you as a friend! Welcome to Virginia Gorda,
                  which is now fully in our possession! So give us your grappler, whoever you
                  are."</p>
               <p>"Captain Pierson," said Bertine, addressing the young officer, who now made his
                  appearance; "this is the brave Stark, of whom you have heard me speak
                  frequently."</p>
               <p>Pierson shook the hale old man's hand with a hearty good will.</p>
               <p>"Now tell me, my friend, who are you?" said Stark, addressing Bertine.</p>
               <p>"Don't you remember Harry Bertine?"</p>
               <p>"God is merciful!" exclaimed the old man, a tear starting from his eye. "I thought
                  you were dead—you are much changed!"</p>
               <p>"What of my beloved——"</p>
               <p>"Speak not of them here," interrupted the veteran. "Follow me to our
                  quarters—until then, be patient."</p>
               <p>"Then they are——"</p>
               <p>"Give not up to despair in the hour of victory," again interrupted Stark. "You
                  have much to live for. We are now masters of the isle, where we have resided for
                  fifteen years. Red Martin is dead—that heroic woman, his wife, has received a
                  mortal wound, and not more than three of all Red Martin's band have survived the
                  struggle."</p>
               <p>The Amazons bore away the wounded Haidee in their arms. Soon after followed Owen,
                  Stark, Bertine and Pierson. They repaired to the cave which Red Martin had so long
                  occupied, the apartments of which were furnished with princely splendor.</p>
               <p>"Be seated," said Stark; "these comfortable quarters, for want of more rightful
                  claimants, we may as well call our own."</p>
               <p>"Were not those females, in male attire, whom we saw on the ramparts?" inquired
                  the young commander of the corvette.</p>
               <p>"You have judged rightly," replied Stark.</p>
               <p>"And that light-haired, beautiful boy, who waved the flag, was, after all,
                  a——"</p>
               <p>"A FEMALE—exactly!" added Stark.</p>
               <p>"By all that's beautiful, I never beheld a being with such an angelic
                  countenance," said Pierson, with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"You're a man of taste," resumed the veteran. "Why, bless her little sprightly
                  heart, she 's the pet of us all. If it hadn't been for her, life on the island
                  wouldn't have been half so endurable. You shall see her soon, in her own proper
                  attire, as well as the other ladies of the isle."</p>
               <p>A half an hour passed rapidly in congratulations and explanations, when the ladies
                  appeared to pay their respects and to thank the strangers who had come to offer
                  protection and assistance.</p>
               <p>Amy Owen entered first, and was introduced to the strangers by her father.
                  Presently Mrs. Bertine and her daughter appeared. The matron cast a furtive glance
                  at the strangers, not one of whom did she recognize.</p>
               <p>"Isabella!" said one of the strangers.</p>
               <p>Hearing herself thus called, she was startled, and exclaimed wildly,</p>
               <p>"That voice—sure, I——"</p>
               <p>"Do you not know your husband?" he inquired with extended arms.</p>
               <p>"It is—ah! it is, the voice of my long lost husband! my Henri!"</p>
               <pb n="112-113 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6945-00000056"/>
               <p>And the fond husband and wife, who had been separated for so many years, flew into
                  each other's arms. This ebullition of sudden bliss having somewhat subsided,
                  Captain Stark, taking Oceana by the hand, said—</p>
               <p>"Bertine, I told you that you had much to live for; and here is another agreeable
                  surprise for you; one who has claim to a large share of your affections. This is
                  our darling pet—Oceana Bertine!"</p>
               <p>The enraptured man was dumb with astonishment, as he gazed upon that bright and
                  beautiful being.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear Henri, this is our beloved child—our daughter, Oceana."</p>
               <p>Had an angel from Heaven appeared before Bertine he could not have expressed more
                  surprise. Can it be within the bounds of possibility, thought he, that this
                  angelic creature is our child? Yes—it must be so—for 'tis fifteen years since
                  Oceana was born.</p>
               <p>He embraced her, kissed her, and looked with joy at her perfections.</p>
               <p>"In these moments of my existence, my friends," he said at length, "is contained
                  enough of bliss to repay me for the years of bodily and mental suffering which I
                  have had the misfortune to endure."</p>
               <p>But we leave to the readers' imagination the details of this truly felicitous
                  occasion.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>We might add a chapter or two more of interesting events, that succeeded the
                  stirring incidents already, narrated but as "the course of true love" DID,
                  afterwards, run smooth with the younger characters of our story, we should but
                  repeat an oft told tale.</p>
               <p>A fleet of four vessels sailed from Virginia Gorda, in company, about one week
                  after the island was freed from the buccaneers' power. These vessels were laden
                  with vast treasures, and a great portion of it fell into the possession of those
                  of our dramatis personæ, with whom we feel most interested.</p>
               <p>In the course of eighteen days these vessels arrived safely at one of the
                  principal ports of the United States.</p>
               <p>Bertine, with his family, settled down in the town, in which Capts. Stark and Owen
                  claimed a residence. As soon as the preliminaries could be arranged, the latter
                  was pleased to bestow his daughter's hand on her constant lover, Charles
                  Thorburn.</p>
               <p>The Bertine family received frequent visits from Captain Pierson, and at the end
                  of two years, his marriage with the beautiful Oceana was duly celebrated and
                  proclaimed. Pierson was promoted for his gallant behavior in capturing the
                  pirates, and he finally arose to the highest pinnicle of his profession.</p>
               <p>Mungo, our especial friend, was well cared for by Bertine, with whom he lived
                  happily until the day of his decease.</p>

            <p>This is a thorough-going sea tale, boisterous and stirring, startling, humorous, and
               rollicking. The ocean and the ships thereon, and the Yankee tar himself, are all
               depicted with a life-like reality that cannot fail to delight the reader, while his
               patriotism will receive a warmer glow from the deeds of American prowess on the ocean
               wave, described in "Yankee Jack" with a graphic power of language rarely excelled.
               "Yankee Jack," as a faithful reflex of ocean life, has not been excelled by any work
               of the same kind that has been recently published.</p>

            <p>THIS work cannot fall to excite the deep interest of every one who opens its pages.
               The life and exploits of Alessandro Massaroni, the Robin Hood of Italy, have formed
               the theme of many a romance and song; but the career and character of that famous
               bandit have never been so fully and graphically exhibited as the reader will find
               them to be in the bold "Brigand, or the Mountain Chief." The work is powerfully
               written, and the scenes so life-like, that the imagination insensibly yields to the
               magic of the author, and the reader cannot help fancying himself among the
               picturesque mountain passes near Rome, surrounded by all the enchantment, the
               mystery, the terror and the chivalry which characterized that strange era of Italian
               brigandism, in which Alessandro Massaroni was the master spirit. It is a wonderful
               book.</p>

            <p>The immense sale of this deeply-interesting work fully proves the hold it has taken
               on popular favor. It is Inded one of the most fascinating novels that has recently

               servant-maid's life, in a manner at once powerful, and such as to absorb the intense
               interest of the reader. It is in fact a domestic mirror, in which the reader will
               behold, depicted with truth, all kinds of masters and mistresses of families, and the
               many good and evil ways in which households can be managed. It is one of Reynolds

               <p>All the vivid descriptions of the scenes of war, and the graphic picturing of the
                  soldier's life, that lent surn a charm of Lever's "Charles O' Malley." are
                  equalied, and in a great many instances surpassed by the "Guerilla Chief, or the
                  Romance of War." There is more of the "wildness" of war, if we may so express it,
                  in which the romantic during, the fierce cruelty, and the reckless bravery of the
                  handit chief, are mingled in a thrilling manner with the achievements of the
                  courageous and honorable soldier. It is the most intensely interesting episode of

                  throughout are of the most exciting nature, extending in their range from the
                  field of battle, and adventures among Guerilla bandits, to the boudoir, where the
                  notes of war are hushed by those of love. Monks, robbers, and brave soldiers, all
                  pass in a panorama before us, drawn by the hand of a

            <p>MYSTERIES OF THE COURT OF LONDON—This splendid Romance of Reynolds is having a most
               unprecedented run only to be compared, perhaps, with the early popularity of Eugene
               Sue's "Mysteries of Paris," which it excels in deep and thrilling interest. Indeed,
               of its talented author's numerous and well-sustained productions, it is decidedly the
                  master-piece.—<title>London Times.</title>

            <p>For deep, intense, and thrilling interest, this brilliant work is unsurpassed by any

            <p>It is surprising what life, energy and talent, Mr. Reynolds throws into his works;
               how like the canvass, which glows instinct with life and beauty beneath the touch of
               a master painter, the commonest scenes of life are invested with surpassing interest
               by his pen. The "Mysteries of the Court of London" is undoubtedly his greatest work,

            <p>This work presents a glowing picture of that epitome of human suffering and
               misery—the pawnbroker's office! What a view of life it unfolds! Crime, dissipation,
               folly, and too often unmerited destitution, meet at the pawnbroker's counter. The
               high and the low, the virtuous and the depraved, are alike the subjects of the cold,
               heartless, cent-per-cent usurer; who weighs with equal indifference the cherished
               token of affection which want wrings from the reluctant hand of suffering virtue, and
               the ill-got prize which successful villany presents, and doles out his ducats with
               miserly hesitancy. Such are the scenes which, with the hand of a master, are
               portrayed here; and we venture the assertion, that it will be found a work of deep
               and intense interest.—<title>Pathfinder.</title>

            <p>This volume contains a clever, spirited, and interesting tale of the sea, by the
               author of "The Post Captain." We know not who the real author of the work just named
               may be; but we are aware that there are numerous claimants to the honor, and some of
               them would find it difficult to spell even the name without the help of a dictionary.
               We ourselves have met with at least half a dozen "literary gents" who mysteriously
               and confidently assured us that they were the real Simon Pures; and the same was the
               case in respect to the novel of "Godolphin," until Sir E. Bulwer Lytton stepped
               forward, at length, to acknowledge the paternity. The volume under notice was written
               to delineate life on board an East Indiaman. The object is executed in a manner that
               will prove satisfactory to the readers of nautical tales. Some of the characters are
               well sketched—the Nabob for instance, and the gallant Captain, who eventually marries
               the sprightly Cicely.—<title>London Weekly Dispatch.</title> Price 25 cents.</p>

               <p>ONE of the most sparkling books of the season. For vivid pictures of bold and
                  reckless daring, and dashing adventure, it has never been excelled. The author has
                  unrolled a glorious panorama, in which the palace and the hovel, the prison and
                  the home of virtue, are all presented in striking colors.—<title>Critic.</title>
               </p>
               <p>A spirited and piquant romance, irresistibly enchaining the attention of the
                  reader by a series of the wildest and most exciting adventures, in which tragedy
                  struggles with comedy, and the extremes of life are graphically
                     depicted.—<title>Spectator.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This is an intensely interesting narrative of the career of a gay youth. Once
                  taken up, the reader will not be apt to lay it down until he has followed the
                  "Fortunes and Misfortunes of Harry Racket Seapegrace" to the end. The chase after
                  the Scapegrace, that the author gives to the reader, is an exciting and lively
                     one.—<title>Disp.</title>

            <p>This is altogether one of the most interesting Tales of the Sea ever published. The
               scenes are drawn by a master hand, vivid, full of intense interest; they excel in

            <p>The author of "Cavendish" has long held high rank as a writer of Sea Stories, and, in
               the present work, vindicates his claim to rank with the best authors on those topics.

               certain air of truthfulness did not assure us "such <unclear/> have been," even
               though they excite "our special wonderment." The author is as familiar with the

               become a part of the history of the West. Though widely different in character from
               the renowned late pirate, and though the scourge of an earlier generation, Hare
               possessed qualities scarcely less remarkable than his satanic prototype; and his
               exploits may claim even a stronger interest, from the fact that he figured as the
               first great freebooter of the Republic. If Murrell may be called the "Massaroni of
               the West," Hare may be designated as the "Ridaldo Rinaldini of America."—Price 25
