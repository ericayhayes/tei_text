" How little knowledge of man must the&#xD;

they could take you for a simple and %50it-&#xD;

must, before we go to the eouneil, aseert a&#xD;
that we are not suspected at alt; for, if wp&#xD;
are, we betray the place of meeting to the&#xD;
vigilant spies, and this would bring misery&#xD;
on our friends, and frustrate our schemes."&#xD;

would no$ do to arrest or molest oneo f those&#xD;

- "But this gives us also ample time to4&#xD;
examine our path carefully," said Jonathafn.&#xD;
" Let us, each for himself, wander through&#xD;

"Simon, Hillel's son lives," Abba Shaul&#xD;
said; "he has not forgotten Helen, for his&#xD;
love for her is imperishable as the powerful&#xD;

would be marvelous, should they not regard&#xD;

"Speak, my friend, I must, know your&#xD;

"My father stands high in the estimation&#xD;
of those who know him," said Simon; "he&#xD;
is the most respected among the Pharisees&#xD;
and is a firm Pharisee himself. You know&#xD;
the hatred and bitterness existing between&#xD;
the Pharisees and Sadducees, especially&#xD;
since the latter have sworn allegiance to&#xD;
Herod. Your father, Sabion, noble Helen,&#xD;
is an influential leader of the Sadduceea&#xD;

Helen fell down upon her knees, lifted&#xD;
up her hands to Simon, and prayed him&#xD;
vehemently not to consider her a traitor.&#xD;
Again and anon she prayed him, to change&#xD;
his determination; but, when she found out,&#xD;
that words were wasted in vain, she rose,&#xD;
and with a manly resoluteness she stated:&#xD;
"I can not, God witness, 1 can not leave&#xD;
you; still I must hate him who schemes the&#xD;
death of my father. I am determined to&#xD;
die or to prevent -you from committing the&#xD;
horrid murder. Simon, here in the pre-&#xD;

She was gone before Simon could reply,&#xD;
leaving him in the most wretched condition,&#xD;
tormented, tortured between-love and duty,&#xD;
an. indomitable affection and a glowing .pat-&#xD;
riotism. He had not much time to reflect&#xD;
on his condition, for Abba Shaul- came in&#xD;
and advised him, not to return to the city,&#xD;
but to choose by-ways to reach his compan-&#xD;
ions encamped outside the Fishgate. Simon&#xD;
obeyed, silently. Thoughtfully he mounted&#xD;
his ass and pursued the by-ways around thea&#xD;
city as Abba Shaul had told him.&#xD;
&#xD;
veled long after the soldier had gone, and&#xD;
can not tell yet what all this means; but I&#xD;
know we are betrayed and in imminent&#xD;
dagger."&#xD;
"This is marvelous, indeed," said Simon.&#xD;
"We must take proper care to evade deted-&#xD;
tion, and 1 have a good plan to do so. I&#xD;
have a wealthy uncle, a brother of my fith-&#xD;
er, whose co ntry residence is a few fur-&#xD;
longs from ere. He has plenty of Babf-&#xD;
lonian cost mes, and we have false beads,&#xD;
which baffle detection. We speak well all&#xD;
dialeAts of the  ramees and Chaldees.' Nat&#xD;
far from here, a Babylonian caravan is en-&#xD;
camped. Lee us dress at my uncle's, join&#xD;
the caravan, hand be Babylonians for some&#xD;
time. You know Herod favors all foreign-&#xD;
ers, especially the Babylonians."&#xD;
The plan was agreed upon. Both men&#xD;
went away, unobserved, to carry out their&#xD;
scheme. When scarcely gone, several 'fl-&#xD;
core arrived among the peasants, and in-&#xD;
formed them oftwo young men having come&#xD;
up with them from Jericho, who must be&#xD;
presented to the governor of the city. The&#xD;
peasants were all assembled, every one's&#xD;
name was asked, but none called himself&#xD;
either Simon or Jonathan. On iuiry&#xD;
whether any-was missing the officer' were&#xD;
told, that all were present; none of the peas-&#xD;
ants would have betrayed the two young&#xD;
men, whose secret mission they appeared te&#xD;

have guessed. The officers took two young&#xD;
mew 'along, answering best to the descrip-&#xD;
tion of the persons wanted, notwithstanding&#xD;
the loud protests of the arrested and the&#xD;
other peasants. The assurance that no&#xD;
harm should be done to them, pacified the&#xD;
agitated multitude, and they patiently await-&#xD;
ed the result.  When, however, the next&#xD;
morning the messengers of the Highpriest&#xD;
care to array them in a solemn procession&#xD;
to enter! the city, and the two peasants had&#xD;
not returned; it took the whole influence of&#xD;
the priests to pacify the agitated minds,&#xD;
who considered, it an unpardonable sin,&#xD;
that their two neighbors were prevented&#xD;
kc    paying obedience to the law.&#xD;
The procession was headed by the musi-&#xD;
cians who, with their flutes, trumpets, cor-&#xD;
nets, harps, cymbals and other instruments,&#xD;
discussed Davidian music. Then were led the&#xD;
sacrifices, the bullock first, his horns gilded,&#xD;
on his head the olive crown, and the whole&#xD;
animal was covered with fruits and flowers.&#xD;
And then came the smaller animals, as ev-&#xD;
ery comer thought proper to offer. One&#xD;
brought a calf, another a lamb, the third a&#xD;
young goat, as a peace-offering, a thank-offer-&#xD;
iog, or to pay a vow, while others brought&#xD;
their first born animals along to the priest.&#xD;
All the, animals were more or less orna-&#xD;
mented with fruits and flowers, each led by&#xD;
a boy, who came up to see the city. Then&#xD;
came the peasants, with their baskets of&#xD;
gold, silver or palm branches filled with the&#xD;
finest tropical fruits and ornamented with&#xD;
Rowers, each carrying a pair of pigeons as&#xD;
the requisite sacrifice. In the midst of the&#xD;
procession was carried a large banner with&#xD;
the shield of David and Judah's lion on it,&#xD;
surrounded by palm trees, as Jericho was&#xD;
commonly cal led the city of palms.&#xD;
As they slowly moved toward the gate of&#xD;
the city they sung, to the sound of music,&#xD;
the one hundred and twenty second Psalm ;&#xD;
'I am glad, I am glad&#xD;
'in my soul, in my heart,&#xD;
When they say: For the house&#xD;
Of the lrd we'll depart.&#xD;
Jeraatlem!I Jerusalem!&#xD;
- Within thy gates our feet shall stand-.&#xD;
Compaot and strong thou art, our gem,&#xD;

F THE PEoPLE,,&#xD;
And to thee flock the tribes,&#xD;

Come with dance and with song,&#xD;
And with thanks to the Lord.&#xD;
For there the thrones of judgment stand&#xD;
The Lord rules from this loved place;&#xD;
And there the throne of Israel's land&#xD;
Once filled by David's royal race.&#xD;
Do bid hail, greet with peace&#xD;
Jerusalem's towers.&#xD;
They prosper who do wreathe&#xD;
With sweet love thy bowers.&#xD;
May peace within thy walls abide,&#xD;
And plenty in thy mansions be,&#xD;
In thy Temple our God reside--&#xD;
Jerusalem 1 be peace with thee."&#xD;
. Arrived at the city gate, the procession&#xD;
was received by the officiating priests, Le-&#xD;
vites, treasurers of the Temple, and the re-&#xD;
presentatives of the Israelites at the sanc-&#xD;
tuary, all clad in their sacerdotal vestments,&#xD;
bearing the banners and ensigns of the city&#xD;
and the sanctuary. Before them went the.&#xD;
Levites, with their cornets and trumpets,&#xD;
and after them came the curious multitude.&#xD;
Also, a deputation of the city bearing the&#xD;
standard with the Ariel, a deputation of the&#xD;
Sanhedrin carrying a representation of the&#xD;
scroll of the Law, and the messengers of the&#xD;
King, before whom a Roman standard, uni-&#xD;
ted with Judah's lion, was carried, came&#xD;
among the rest, to receive the strangers.&#xD;
After lie deputy of the Highpriest had&#xD;
spoken the blessing over them, the King's&#xD;
messenger had promised them his protec-&#xD;
tion, and the city authorities had offered&#xD;
them the hospitality of the capitol, the re-&#xD;
presentatives of the Sanhedrin admonished&#xD;
them always to obey the will of God with a&#xD;
willing heart. Then the procession organ-&#xD;
ised again, and, with music and song, with&#xD;
floating banners and standards, with numer-&#xD;

When lHaba ben Buta had resumed his&#xD;
seat, Simon rose and replied: " Israelites,&#xD;
almen and brethren, your servants, Jonathan&#xD;
ben Uziel and Simon ben Hillel, the pupils&#xD;
of my illustrious father, come messengers&#xD;
from the council of the Scribes, of Israel's&#xD;
wise men, in the vicinity of Jerieho, thel&#xD;
place where once the prophet Eliahm held his&#xD;
councils. They desire us to tell you, your&#xD;
cause is also theirs, your grievances are&#xD;
theirs also; therefore, they desire to act in&#xD;

" Abba Shaul ben Botnith knows, that&#xD;

the same oath as you have. We are ready&#xD;

the fearful words, in a tone frantically wild ;&#xD;
" My second duty is to slay proud Sabion."&#xD;
A shriek, shrill and painful, resounded&#xD;
from another pirt of the hall; every look&#xD;
turned in ' that direction. "'Treachery !-&#xD;
Treachery! " several exclaimed, simultane-&#xD;
ously, "it is not haruch ben Menahem, it is&#xD;

"A woman'! " said Helen, throwing cf'&#xD;

" Death to the intruder ! " several men&#xD;
cried, and rushed toward her. Simon and&#xD;
Abba Shaul protected her. " None shall&#xD;
kill her as long as A bba Shaul lives," the&#xD;
powerful man   thundered, swinging  his&#xD;
sword. " Shed no innocent blood," Simon&#xD;
cried, vehemently. "None shall die in Is-&#xD;
rael without a trial, before the tribunal of&#xD;
law and justice: none shall die in Israel, un-&#xD;
less the law commands his death," Baba ben&#xD;
Buta calmly said. The swords were return-&#xD;

the chair of the blind m in, to stand a lawful&#xD;
trial for her intrusion.&#xD;

CHAPTER         II.&#xD;
A SCENE IN THE ROYAL        PALACE.&#xD;
Passing through the rows of palaces north&#xD;
west of the theater, which stood nearly in&#xD;
the center of Acra, or the Lower City, as one&#xD;
part of Jerusalem was called-we stop before&#xD;
a large park, in which nothing is omitted&#xD;
which nature and art combined produce to&#xD;
charm and captivate even the over-irritated&#xD;
sensualist of tropical lands. The verdant&#xD;
carpet variegated with Flora's blooming&#xD;
children was intersected with shady walks,&#xD;
while the palm tree, the cedar and the fig&#xD;
tree stood peaceably together. There the&#xD;
rich foliage of the vine protected an artesian&#xD;
well from the heat of the sun ; here the olive&#xD;
and Jericho's balm shrubs were intimately&#xD;
crowded together, upon which the pomegran-&#xD;
ate and the golden orange appeared to look&#xD;
down with elated pride. Aloes and myrtles&#xD;
by the side of lemon trees impregnated theI&#xD;
air with their sweet scent, in rivalry with&#xD;
their precious neighbors, the narcissus and&#xD;
the clove.&#xD;
We pass these shadowy ways, up the slight&#xD;
declivity, and arrive before a magnificentI&#xD;
palaceof Tuscan structure. Passingthrough&#xD;
the- marble portal, we step into a square&#xD;
Court surrounded by colossal columns, upon&#xD;
which the front of the upper story rests.--&#xD;
Under it, upon the mosaic floor, low chairs,&#xD;
rich sofas, and little round tables are&#xD;
placed. Sentinels and servants haste to and&#xD;
fro, courtiers and high dignitaries in their&#xD;
state costume come and go continually. Ev-&#xD;
ery where, Grecian art and taste appear com-&#xD;
bined with oriental luxury and royal opu-J&#xD;
&#xD;
In the center of the saloon, on a platform&#xD;
several steps high, covered with red velvet&#xD;
interwoven with flowers of gold and silver,&#xD;
there rested the rich sofa, on which the most&#xD;
beautiful, Inost virtuous and at the same&#xD;
time most unfortunate of Queens,Mariamne&#xD;
the last daughter of the heroic family of the&#xD;
Asmoneans sat. Her head reclined upon&#xD;
her white; round arm, on which fell a profu-&#xD;
sion of black tresses, contrasting beautifully&#xD;
with the three strings of Persian pearls&#xD;
around the head, to keep uncovered a prom-&#xD;
inent and lilly white forehead. Her eyes&#xD;
which, like two solitary stars glittered under&#xD;
the dark brows, were fixed on her mother,&#xD;
Alexandra, who sat on the sa e sofa, and&#xD;
spoke to her on matters of mo entous in-&#xD;
portance. None, beside the two ladies, wah&#xD;
in the saloon. They spoke little louder than&#xD;
a whisper, still we must know part of the&#xD;
conversation.&#xD;
" He is the father of my children," said&#xD;
Mariamne, with much feeling, " I can not&#xD;
consent to his destruction."&#xD;
"And the murderer of your race," said&#xD;
Alexandra, in a tone of bitterness, "the wil.&#xD;
ful and malignant assassin of your brother,&#xD;
Queen. Do you know, daughter, the heart,&#xD;
the love, the inexpressible affections of a&#xD;
mother, for her children ? Why, then,&#xD;
would you not comprehend the pain, the un-&#xD;
utterable affliction of a mother bereft of her&#xD;
only Pon by the assassin's vile schemes, by&#xD;
foul and cowardish intrigues, by a despotic&#xD;
and self-deifying King? Why, then, would&#xD;
you not understand the mother's intense de-&#xD;
sire, to avenge her murdered child ?"&#xD;
" Because it is ignoble and impious," said&#xD;
Mariamne, briefly. "God who knows man's.&#xD;
motives, God alone can judge man's actions,&#xD;

Or did the assassination of your brother,&#xD;
God's Highpriest, not convince you, that he&#xD;
is capable of any crime, any outrage, before&#xD;
which hell and Satan themselves would,&#xD;
blush ?" -'&#xD;
"Mother, mother, I prithee," Mariamne&#xD;
supplicated," berena e me not of the last&#xD;
spark of affection I bear to the father'of my&#xD;
children. No, lie can not be so monstrous,&#xD;
so diabolic as to slay his own children. You&#xD;
know how passionately he loves me."&#xD;
Alexandra laughed angrily, on saying:&#xD;
"Yes, yes, my magnanimous daughter ; I&#xD;
recollect how passionately he loves you, so&#xD;
passionately, indeed, that on being summon-&#xD;
ed to appear before Mare Antony $ clear&#xD;
himself of the.charge of having murdered my&#xD;
son, the Highpriest, he commanded Joseph,&#xD;
his brother-in-law to slay all of us, even you&#xD;
and your children, in case he should be pun.&#xD;

that he killed Joseph, his brother-in-law, be-&#xD;

murdered hundreds, who killed his own&#xD;
brother-in-law and two of his brothers, the&#xD;
man who assassinated the Lord's High-&#xD;

must affirm, deserves an ignominious death.&#xD;
But it is not this which your mother, in be-&#xD;
half of your royal family, of your own chil-&#xD;

"The Queen is sick," said Helen, quickly,&#xD;

" Do not care, my child, for the peculiar&#xD;

Helen lamented." "It can not be, it must&#xD;

with the torments of death I"&#xD;
" Who cares in our days about death 1"&#xD;
Sabion vociferated. "It is something so&#xD;

" What good will it do you, foolish child?"&#xD;
Sabion asked.&#xD;
"It will relieve my heart," said Helen,&#xD;
feelingly. " It will sustain me,that I be not,&#xD;

know two things before hand. Do you know&#xD;
the charter of these two men, and what&#xD;
connection have you with them ?"&#xD;
"I do not know these two men, nor do I&#xD;
knuow their characters ; I have no connee-&#xD;
tions with them," Helen. said, calmly and&#xD;
composedly; "they are innocent peasants&#xD;
whom I know not."&#xD;
"Perfectly well," said Sabion, sneeringly;&#xD;
" ninterly perfect. My daughter perfectly&#xD;
sustains the character of a lady at court.-&#xD;
She looks innocent, harmless and sweet as&#xD;
though nothing wrong, nothing strange had&#xD;
happened. She pleads a total denial of all&#xD;
facts, and it is for me to prove them. Sa-&#xD;
gacious, very sagacious, indeed. But the&#xD;
evidence is in my hands and it shall not es-&#xD;

"I do say here, in the presence of my God&#xD;

the two men you have arrested are strangers&#xD;

Sabion smiled cunningly, when saying,&#xD;
"Very good. A Queen could not do any&#xD;
better. They are all innocent, my daughter,&#xD;
her secret friends and all mankind besides.&#xD;
It is a capital joke. But my innocent&#xD;

remarked. "The two prisoners remain in&#xD;

affair.. Woman's tears and her persuading&#xD;
voice are insufficient to make me forget the&#xD;
duties I owe to my King."&#xD;
" And your only child's petitionY' Helen&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
" Is of no avail," Sabion replied. "I am&#xD;
the King's servant"-&#xD;
" And the peoples opponent," Helen re-&#xD;
marked, imprudently. But, frightened by&#xD;
her own words, she added, "Baruch ben&#xD;
Menahem, the innocent Essenee, the son of&#xD;
your King's friend, is my testimony."&#xD;
Sabion scrutinized her sharply, with his&#xD;
piercing look, which darted arrowlike from&#xD;
his small black eyes. "Do you know this ?"&#xD;
he asked, slowly and shrewdly. "Ah, I be-&#xD;
lieve Simon ben Hillel told you. Therefore&#xD;
he must die."&#xD;
Helen trembled, when her father articula,&#xD;
ted the last words, so firmly and resolutely,&#xD;
that no doubt could be entertained as tp&#xD;
their meaning. She quickly recovered her&#xD;
self-possession, and asked, smilingly, her&#xD;
father, " Would you have Simon ben Hillel&#xD;
die, if he is my lover, if-U must die on his&#xD;
grave ?"&#xD;
"Your lover, unhappy child ?" Sabion&#xD;
asked, in a tone of consternation, "You do&#xD;
not mean this, in earnest, my child,do you?"&#xD;
"Whenever your anger will be over, I&#xD;
will tell you truly, what knoww" Helen said.&#xD;
"I speak not to Herod's.stern officer, I shall&#xD;
gladly and sincerely speak to my father."&#xD;
" Speak, my child," Sabion said, half smi-&#xD;
ling, " but speak the truth and nothing but&#xD;
the truth."&#xD;
"I do my father," said Helen. "I lonv&#xD;
but one man, I will ever love him only, and&#xD;
he is indeed, Simon ben Hillel. But neither&#xD;
of the two men arrested is Simon ben Hi-&#xD;
lel."                                s&#xD;
1 " Treacherous child, unnatural daughter,'&#xD;
Sabion exclaimed, angrily, "you love the son&#xD;
of our archenemy; for Hillel is the head of&#xD;
the Pharisees. Never shall you be his wife.&#xD;
Never shall you be the partner of a despised&#xD;
Pharisee, aspoor Babyloniian, a foe of King&#xD;
Herod. Never will I give.my consent to this&#xD;
unnatural union." After a while, he con-&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
from the commission of an act which sure-&#xD;
ly would forever render me most misera-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
After some reflection, she called Elvira.-&#xD;
The girl came. " You are right, my good&#xD;
Elvira,"- Helen said. " My father's servants&#xD;
informed him of my orders, and I despair."&#xD;
"No cause for it," said Elvira, "I do not&#xD;
know what interest you take in the two&#xD;
young men; but I know themout of Sabion's&#xD;
reach. "&#xD;
" Where, my beloved sisterly friend, where&#xD;

will, I must know it."&#xD;
"I can not tell you, beloved Helen," El-&#xD;
vira said, "I can not tell you."&#xD;
"0 behold the anxiety of my trembling&#xD;

But he pushed me aside with the measuring&#xD;

of others, I come to you, Hillel and ask you,&#xD;
can you teach me your religionwhile I stand&#xD;

"Why art thou so in haste my son ?" Hil-&#xD;
lel asked.&#xD;
" Because I dislike to be much longer&#xD;
among barbarians," the Greek answered,&#xD;
saucily.&#xD;
Hillel was silent for a moment, he appa-&#xD;
rently reflected on a proper answer to the&#xD;
insult offered him. Then he said in a mild&#xD;
tone, "Thou mayest be right. I hear the'&#xD;
Greeks are very wise, and it behooves thee&#xD;
to live in a land of learned men."&#xD;
" Is this all you have to tell me ?" the&#xD;
Greek asked, somewhat embarrassed.&#xD;
"If this is all thou wisheet to know, yes,"&#xD;
Hillel responded, quietly,&#xD;
"But, 1 wish to know your religion," the&#xD;
Greek said.&#xD;
"The Greeks are very wise, why should&#xD;
they learn anything of barbarians ?" saidI&#xD;
Hillel.&#xD;
" Yes, indeed, they are very wise," said&#xD;
the Greek, " but in Religion, it appears tome&#xD;
they are quite foolish. Therefore I come to&#xD;
learn of the barbarians."&#xD;
"In what are the Greeks wise?" Hillel&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"Ineverything, except Religion," theGreek&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
"Can the Greeks tell us, why and how we&#xD;
andtbethingsaround us exist?" Hillel asked.&#xD;
" Can they tell us, how the sun shines, the&#xD;
thunder rolls,the hurricane roars, the oceanI&#xD;
&#xD;
size of the heavens, the depth of the ocean&#xD;
f or the compass of the air? And if they can-&#xD;
not tell this in any time, why wouldet thou&#xD;
assume to know the will of the Creator&#xD;
I and Great Cause of all these things in&#xD;
so short a time as thou canst stand on&#xD;
one leg?"&#xD;
"I am foolish, pardon me my venerablemas-&#xD;
ter," the Greek said, overcome by the kind-&#xD;
I ness of Hillel. "But I vowed a sacred vow&#xD;
to Minerva, that if I could not learn the re-&#xD;
ligion of the eastern Barbarians in as short&#xD;
a time as I can stand on one leg, I would re-&#xD;
turn and bring incense to her shrine. I&#xD;
must keep my vow."&#xD;
"Speak, I prithee," said Hillel; "If I had&#xD;
vowed to my table to return to it and do&#xD;
homage to it, must I do it ? Still this table&#xD;
exists and Minerva exists nowhere."&#xD;
"Minerva exist nowhere ? " the Greek&#xD;
asked, astonished, " also not in Olymp?&#xD;
Speak ! old sage. But no, speak not, I dare&#xD;
not learn anything of you unless you can&#xD;
teach me everything concerning your reli-&#xD;
gion, while I can stand on one leg. I shall&#xD;
not violate my vow."&#xD;
" Before I do so," said Hillel, "let us un-&#xD;
derstand each other what religion is. Is it&#xD;
not to worship God or the gods, as He or&#xD;
they wish it? and is not to do the will of God&#xD;
or the gods, to worship Him or them ? Speak,&#xD;
myAon, is it not so?"&#xD;
"So it is," said the Greek, "I agree."&#xD;
" Then, stand on one leg and hear my re-&#xD;
ligion," said Hillel, solemnly, while rising.&#xD;
The Greek looked with, surprise at the&#xD;
straight, colossal figure of the ancient sage,&#xD;
on assuming his position.&#xD;
"Whatever hurts thee, thou shalt not do&#xD;
thy neighbor," Hillel said, slowly. "This&#xD;
is the principle part of my religion, the rest&#xD;
is a mere explanation. Go and finish thy&#xD;
studies."&#xD;
The Greek stood awhile as though rooted&#xD;
to the ground, gazing aghast into the open&#xD;

" Neither thy dagger, nor thy arm is any tue," he exclaimed, "I am  thy child, thy&#xD;

member, my shield is the arm of God, and forget not, magnanimous man, that it is in-&#xD;
my weapon is my confidence in Him."    dipensably necessary that you should know&#xD;
" And your God is truly a marvelous God the name of the man who, for no cause&#xD;
who watches over his saints," the Greek known to me, desires after your life and also&#xD;
said, " for I was sent here to assassinate you, hunts after your son to do hinm, as I was&#xD;
but I can not. 'Whatever hurts thee, thou hired to do you.&#xD;
&#xD;
shalt not do thy neighbor,' " the Greek re-&#xD;
peated, slowly.&#xD;
"Dust thou repent now thy sinful con-&#xD;
duct and wicked thoughts ?" the old saint&#xD;
asked, mildly.&#xD;
".I do sincerely and truly," the Greek re-&#xD;
plied, much humiliated.&#xD;
" Then God will forgive thee," Hillel said,&#xD;
" if all men thou hast offended will do the&#xD;
same."&#xD;
" You first, noble, generous demi-god," the&#xD;
Greek supplicated, kneeling before Hillel,&#xD;
"you must first forgive the villain who has&#xD;
been hired to execute a foul villany, a hor.&#xD;
rid outrage."&#xD;
"Rise, my son," Hillel said, "and remem-&#xD;
ber my religion 'Whatever hurts thee thou&#xD;
shalt notdo thy neighbor.' Would it not hurt&#xD;
me to pray thee for pardon, and not obtain&#xD;
it? I have no grudge against thee, there is&#xD;
nothing to be pardoned, rise and be hence-&#xD;
forth a good man. So may all men thou&#xD;
hast hurt forgive thee, as I do with all my&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
The Greek rose, clasped his dagger and&#xD;
listed it up exclaiming enthusiastically,&#xD;
"noneshalloutdome in magnanimity Great&#xD;
Hillel, I will avenge thee and let it it cost my&#xD;
life. I will assassinate him who sent me to&#xD;
assassinate you. Know it, venerable man,&#xD;
the mpan who sent me is"---.&#xD;
"Not one word more shalt thou speak, my&#xD;
son," Hillel interrupted. " Would it not&#xD;
hurt thee to hear the name of thy enemy&#xD;
mentioned? It might hurt me, therefore&#xD;
thou shalt not tell me. Would it not hurt&#xD;
thee to be murdered? Therefore thou shalt&#xD;
not murder him who hired thee to do the&#xD;
&#xD;
" That is Sabion," said Hillel, "none else.&#xD;
lut tell me where is my son?"&#xD;
" In Jerusalem, most likely by this time,&#xD;
in the hands of-Sabion, " said the Greek,&#xD;
" and there he is in the v ry worst hands."&#xD;
" God will protect him," illel said, calm-&#xD;
ly. "I know not why he went to Jerusa-&#xD;
lem, where danger now lurks in every cor-&#xD;
ner ; but God will protect him,"&#xD;
"Are you so sure of God's protection?"&#xD;
the Greek asked.&#xD;
"Sure, quite sure, my son," the sage re-&#xD;
plied. "I hurt none, why should God hurt&#xD;
me? God is the All-just. If He inflicts pun-&#xD;
ishment,it must be deserved. There,in yon-&#xD;
der rivulet, I once saw a skull floating, and I&#xD;
said 'As thou hast thrown others in the wa-&#xD;
ter, thou wast thrown in thyself, and finally,&#xD;
also he will float who caused thee to perish&#xD;
in the water,' and the wise men approved of&#xD;
my doctrine. God will do me no harm,' o&#xD;
wrong."&#xD;
" But tell me, my master," said the Greek,&#xD;
" is it enough in the sight of your God, if&#xD;
man does no wrong ? If all of us do no&#xD;
wrong, none will do any good, and virtue&#xD;
will have no patron."&#xD;
" Do harm to none, and thou wilt certainly&#xD;
do good to all with whom thou comestin con&#xD;
tact," said Hillel; " for man must be active&#xD;
God gifted him with an active soul. The&#xD;
great lesson he is commanded to study is to&#xD;
hurt none, harm none. He must do some-&#xD;
thing, so he can do but what is good."&#xD;
"Did you not say God protects you ?" the&#xD;
Greek asked ; " If so, how does he protect&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"I know not how," said Hillel, "but I&#xD;

"And I will be one of them," said the&#xD;
Greek, "I will practice the first lesson I&#xD;
have received. I will goto Jerusalem, harm&#xD;
none, hurt none, and protect your son. Then&#xD;
Will return with him, and learn of you&#xD;
my second lesson."&#xD;
"Go with God, my son," said Hillel, "but&#xD;
never forget my first lesson." He took a&#xD;
spade from a corner of the room and went&#xD;
to the door with the Greek, who asked him,&#xD;
"What will you do with this spade Y"&#xD;
"I will work in the garden " said the&#xD;
sage. .,&#xD;
"You will work ? no, you shall not," said&#xD;
the Greek. "Here ii the money I was paid&#xD;
for your life Itis enough tosupportyou and&#xD;
your family one year."&#xD;
"Whoever despises gifts will live," said&#xD;
the sage, "so the wise King said; because&#xD;
the poor only takes gifts, and the poor&#xD;
is esteemed like the dead. I am not poor,&#xD;
I can work."&#xD;
.The Greek finding his repeated attempts;&#xD;
togive Hillel the money a vain and fruitless&#xD;
task, asked again: " Why should not your&#xD;
wife and children work for you ?"&#xD;
"Because it is my duty to support them,"&#xD;
said Hillel. "My wife and my children are&#xD;
my best friends, the partners of my joy as&#xD;
of my aMiction; why should I not work with&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;
"You should not work at all," said the&#xD;
Greek, "you are so wise and learned in your&#xD;
Jaw, that others should work for you while&#xD;
you study for them."&#xD;
"None can study for his neighbor," said&#xD;
Hillel. "If thou knowest much, do not&#xD;
think more of thyself on that account; for&#xD;
thouart created to this- very purpose. De-&#xD;
grade wisdom not to a stepping stone to&#xD;
wqlth and honors, or to a spade to dig for a&#xD;
sausen ce.. Whoever wears the Toga chang-&#xD;
N (pr the worse; for honors and wealth are&#xD;
dggerous companions."&#xD;
By that time they had come to the end of&#xD;
thq garde. A clamor of wo was heard in&#xD;
thl, neighborhood. The stranger turned&#xD;
quickly round, looking toward the cottage.&#xD;
Hillel- smiled. " Fear not, stranger, the&#xD;
&#xD;
noise is not in my house," said he, "for&#xD;
God protects it, and my wife and children&#xD;
cry not if a misfortune befall them. They&#xD;
know that no actual evil can befall them."&#xD;
Astonished and heartily admiring the man&#xD;
of a thousand virtues, the Greek leaving Hil-&#xD;
lel wished to return to Jerusalem.&#xD;
"Let us go and see what this noise means,"&#xD;
said Hillel.&#xD;
" I will go and inquire," said the Greek,&#xD;
"you must'not leave your study ; for you&#xD;
are a wise man, every moment you spend&#xD;
outside of your study is a loss to you and to&#xD;
your people's literature."&#xD;
" Would I like to cry for help, or lament&#xD;
over my misfortune, and none come either&#xD;
to assist or console me?" Hillel asked. "If&#xD;
you are wiser than the rest, you are expect-&#xD;
ed to do more than they do; for if wisdom&#xD;
is not a prompter to 'noble actions, it is a&#xD;
dead treasure in the hands of an avaricious&#xD;
man. He, whose wisdom is greater than&#xD;
his virtuous actions, compares to a tree with&#xD;
wide.stretched branches, a rich foliage and&#xD;
small roots, the slightest storm will up-&#xD;
set it.  He, whose virtuous actions pre-&#xD;
dominate over his wisdom compares to a&#xD;
tree with small branches, a thin foliage and'&#xD;
powerful roots, all the hurricanes may rage&#xD;
against it, still they will not move it from&#xD;
its place. Let trunk and branches be strong&#xD;
and large, the foliage rich, and the root$&#xD;
powerful, and stand fearless in the storm.--&#xD;
Come,my son, let us see whence the calamity&#xD;
comes. Let us help them if we can, or con-&#xD;
sole them, if help is impossible."&#xD;
The Greek kissed the garment, of the old.&#xD;
sage, and followed him silently. In the&#xD;
central market space of Jericho, under the&#xD;
palm trees, a large concourse of people met,&#xD;
clamors of grief and woe were heard among&#xD;
them, and the name of Baruch ben Mena-&#xD;
hem was connected with the accents of la-&#xD;
mentation.&#xD;
"The dead body of Baruch ben Menahem&#xD;
was fodnd in a street of Jerusalem," said&#xD;
one, in reply to Hillel's inquiry ; "they&#xD;
brought it home to the woe-stricken parents.&#xD;
He was Menahem's only son."&#xD;
" The lanes of Jerusalem are soiled with&#xD;
blood," one exolalmed, "the holy oity is de-&#xD;
&#xD;
fled by'the .hands of assassins. The best&#xD;
and nadstgodly are daily killed and thrown&#xD;
in :the street as the 'mud, the nuisance of&#xD;
the houses."&#xD;
Meanwhile the multitude had rapidly in-&#xD;
ereased, the murmurs and the lamentations&#xD;
had become louder and more painful, and&#xD;
.the indignation of the populace had grown&#xD;
into fierce wrath.  Their etump of' an old&#xD;
palm tree was mounted by  a young man&#xD;
who, waving with his hands, bid'silence.&#xD;
"Be silent here and listen," one admon-&#xD;
ished the other, "Jonathan, Uziel's sagaci.&#xD;
eus son wishes to speak to you." The mul-&#xD;
titude listened, when he said: " Men, and&#xD;
brethren, Menahem'e only son, 'Barueh,&#xD;
among the good and noble the best and&#xD;
most'-generous youth, Jericho's pride, a&#xD;
wretched mother's only love, has been,&#xD;
found slain in the streets of Jerusalem.&#xD;
How could she become.a harlot, the faith,&#xD;
ful fortress, justice once dwelt in her, and&#xD;
now murderers."&#xD;
' Accents Of weeping and lamentation, pro-&#xD;
ceeding from the agitated-multitude, inter-&#xD;
rupted the speaker, who continued after&#xD;
awhile: " Tell it not in- Gath, bring not the&#xD;
terrific tidings to the market spaces of~sca-&#xD;
Ion, unless Our enemies would rejoice over&#xD;
our downfall, our adversaries laugh at our&#xD;
degradation.' Let the daughters of Zion&#xD;
dress 'in mourning and weep over their&#xD;
loss; fdr Menahem's son, the faireft of men,&#xD;
has 'been found slain in the streets of Jeru-&#xD;
.salem."&#xD;
'Again, the voices of lamentation and&#xD;
weeping interrupted the speaker; but he&#xD;
resumed after awhile: "Know ye, men and&#xD;
brethren, no 'heifer's neck will be broken,&#xD;
no judges will - wash their: hands over the&#xD;
spot where the corpse was found and say:&#xD;
'Ouia hands have not spilt this blood, and&#xD;

H'e is Iome's King, Rome's creature,"&#xD;
the multitude cried, "we may 'judge a hire-&#xD;

"&amp;amp;Hi1Ie1 speaks, be silent, Hillel speaks,"&#xD;
they admonished ssh other, and all were&#xD;
silent.&#xD;

"-The;King is no less subject to the Laws&#xD;
of God, than the humblest of his subjects,"&#xD;
I said hillel. 49If the King is a criminal, the&#xD;
t laws prescribe his punishment. The mur-&#xD;
derer'should be taken even from God's a-&#xD;
ored altar, if he be the Highpriest and woi&#xD;
ship God in behalf of Israel -and receive&#xD;
the punishment due to him. Whoever spills&#xD;
the blood of man, his blood will be shed by&#xD;
man, such is the wise decree of Providence.&#xD;
If you know Herod and Sabion to be guilty of&#xD;
this crime, you may condemn them, but you&#xD;
can not execute your judgment on the cul-&#xD;
prits. You are weak and they are powerful,&#xD;
you are a few and they are many, you are in&#xD;
Jericho and they are in Jerusalem. There-&#xD;

comes, then the wicked will be punished,&#xD;
and the righteous will be-triumphant."&#xD;
A body of Egyptian soldiers arrived at the&#xD;
spot to disperse the crowd, the eloquence of&#xD;
Hillel and his influence over Jonathan ben&#xD;
Uziel prevented the outbreak of serious dis-&#xD;
turbances.,,&#xD;
" Woe unto thee, Judah," Jonathan ben&#xD;
Uziel cried, on entering the hall of Gurion,&#xD;
where the sages held their meetings, " woe&#xD;
unto Israel, that Egyptians rule over thee&#xD;
and disturb thy councils. Let every patriot&#xD;
clothe in sack and ashes and cry woe, that&#xD;
the birds stop their merry melodies, Tabor&#xD;
and Hermon pour down currents of tears to&#xD;
drown the beauty of the valleys. Let Jor-&#xD;
dan's waters be congealed with shame, and'&#xD;
the hot springs of Tiberias be frozen with&#xD;
consternation, on account of the strangers&#xD;
who set their feet on the neck of Israel, and&#xD;
trample the daughter of Zion in the duet."&#xD;
The sages and scribes assembled in the&#xD;
hall listened with much sympathy to the&#xD;
outpouring of offended and wounded senti-&#xD;
ments, and none interrupted the young man.&#xD;
Apparently overcome by his painful emo-&#xD;
tions, he stopped awhile, then he resumed:&#xD;
"if this is the will of Cleopatra, if she&#xD;
has taken possession of Jericho, that we be&#xD;
not allowed to speak out what we think,&#xD;

Shamai, the mighty antagonist of Hillel ren, and be silent yourselves. But :, o&#xD;
and his school, rose gravely and, looking all do not think ; patriots, wise Kand emeel-&#xD;
about in the hall as though his looks in- lent, like Jonathan ben Usiel, w kanUbe&#xD;
&#xD;
tended to subjugate every heart, he said&#xD;
slowly and sonorously: " Are you not glad&#xD;
to be protected by Cleopatra against the&#xD;
will of Herod, who massacred as many of&#xD;
your colleagues as fell in his hands, why&#xD;
would you trouble her with complaints ?&#xD;
Or do you wish to occasion her to withdraw&#xD;
her protection from this city ; where will&#xD;
you meet, where live, where maintain and'&#xD;
promulgate the sacred traditions of our na-&#xD;
tion ? Uziel's sagacious son is beyond the&#xD;
venomous eye of suspicion, his motives are&#xD;
undoubtedly pure and patriotic, his pur.&#xD;
poses pious and godly ; none dare question&#xD;
the wisdom of Hillel's most renowned pu-&#xD;
pil, and none should oppose his opinions.&#xD;
But, my hair begins to be grey, stored away&#xD;
in my memory lies the history of half a een-&#xD;
tury, au 'bloody, unfortunate and disastrous&#xD;
to Israel, as the days of Syrian oppression.&#xD;
I have seen a King who committed fratri-&#xD;
cide, and a prince who appealed to a for.&#xD;
eign power, to slaughter his own people and&#xD;
secure him the throne of his fathers. I&#xD;
have seen the brother in arms against his&#xD;
own brother, and cruelties. and inhuman&#xD;
outrages, innumerable almost, committed by&#xD;
the combatting parties, who soiled the earth&#xD;
with blood, and filled the la  with misery&#xD;
and sre affliction. Still, very party ap-&#xD;
pealed to the people, and each found its&#xD;
zealous supporters. The people are wither&#xD;
ing leaves, every wind can carry them off to&#xD;
any direction. The people are slumbering&#xD;
sparks, harmless and unconscious of their&#xD;
monstrous strength. My people bleed from&#xD;
a thousand wounds and Jonathan ben Uziel&#xD;
pours vinegar into the aching bruises. Woe&#xD;
unto him, I say, who disturbs my people&#xD;
&#xD;
people from their benevolent repose, 'to b-&#xD;
hold their own misery and rui-deeper pet&#xD;
into the mire of wretchedness. ,Men, seui&#xD;

minion of strangers and tyrants, as they&#xD;
say, when we know that the Kings offotr&#xD;

peace. Therefore I say, let' the pbbple&#xD;
alone, undistu1rbed, calm the agitated 'ps&#xD;

"If this is your will, my father," said&#xD;
Helen, " then give me a token, that such is&#xD;

and bashful beyond description. He sever&#xD;
would have the courage to .ask my hand&#xD;
from you, if I could not encourage him with&#xD;
some token."&#xD;
"Here is the ring which I received of&#xD;
Cleopatra, as a token of her esteem," Bald&#xD;
the father. "This ring is valuable and' of&#xD;
particular interest to me. I entrust it into&#xD;
your hands as a token of my wish, that you&#xD;
be the wife of Aurion, the King's body phy-&#xD;
sician."&#xD;
She grasped the ring so eagerly, and cov-&#xD;
ered the hand of her father with so many&#xD;
kisses, that he was baffled with the unex-&#xD;
pected change in Helen's mind. He 'left&#xD;
her fully satisfied, that he had carried out&#xD;
well, his part of the plot. He was scarcely&#xD;
gone when Simon paid Helen a visit. "Au-&#xD;
rio, body physician of the King;" said Hel-&#xD;
en, " what signifies this precious ring? Es-&#xD;
senee, sagacious and sapient, tell me the im-*&#xD;
port of this costly jewel."&#xD;
Simon scarcely knew how to account for&#xD;
the happy humor of his beloved. He in-&#xD;
spected the ring closely, then he said, "It is&#xD;
your father's ring, I saw it on his finger ;&#xD;
hence it signifies a new trick or trap."&#xD;
" How unkind you are s" Helen said.&#xD;
"The ring signifies the wish and will of&#xD;
my father, that I be your bride, your wife,&#xD;
yours in life and death, in time and eter-&#xD;
nity. This is the import of the costly Jew-&#xD;
"Is it a dream, a fantasy, that makes&#xD;
you speak thus ?" Simon asked, surprised-&#xD;
D " Do tell me, beloved .Helen, what do you&#xD;
mean by all this?"&#xD;
"I mean, that my father advised me,&#xD;
earnestly, to love the young physician,&#xD;
, whose praise he sounds exaltingly," said&#xD;
o she, "and as a token, of his will and wish&#xD;
n he gave me Cleopatra's ring, to encourage&#xD;
u you with it."&#xD;
d"Do you deceive me with false hopes?"&#xD;
."No, I only tell you what is literally&#xD;
', true."&#xD;
" Helen, my love, this is a new plot; by&#xD;

&#xD;
the\Uod of Israel, it is a plot. Either this&#xD;
is intended to restore his inuence over the&#xD;
King, by my agency, or to ruin me. Dear-&#xD;
est beloved Helen, caution, very sagacious&#xD;
caution is necessary in this affair. I re-&#xD;
membernow, that he told me of the King's&#xD;
sister who wished my company. She is the&#xD;
worst trickster at the court, I must see&#xD;
her, to ascertain what this means; for your&#xD;
father had a long conversation with her this&#xD;
morning. Let them plot as much as they&#xD;
please, if you will be wise, we will make the&#xD;
best of it. But at present I advise you, to&#xD;
tell your father, that I was so cool and dis-&#xD;
tant, that it is very hard to gain access to&#xD;
mkt heart. Still, take care of the ring, we&#xD;
might t need it.&#xD;
"It is strange, that you suspect every&#xD;
thing proceeding from my father," said Hel-&#xD;
en, in an offended tone. "If he is ever so&#xD;
wicked, has he not a paternal heart?" -&#xD;
"No, he has not," Simon interrupted, "1&#xD;
know he has not. He informed Herod of&#xD;
the supposed crimes of his own child, just&#xD;
to ingratiate himself in his lord's favor. He&#xD;
just as easy will dispose of you in any way&#xD;
to suit his selfish designs. But, we must be&#xD;
wiser than those corrupted courtiers. Ours&#xD;
is the sagacity of love, the boldness of jus.&#xD;
tice, and the firmness of virtue. Helen, they&#xD;
shall not deceive us. I must now see He-&#xD;
rod, he called me ; then I will see his plot-&#xD;
tin sister, and teach her a lesson on plots&#xD;
and counterplots."&#xD;
Herod was alone when Simon entered the&#xD;
saloon. Without giving him time to.utter&#xD;
one word Herod asked hastily, " Well, my&#xD;
faithful Aurion, have you ascertained any&#xD;
thing in regard to the conspiracy ?"&#xD;
"1I have ascertained more than sufficient&#xD;
to convince you, my lord, of the hazardous&#xD;
game you play with your people, by the&#xD;
wicked advice of your courtiers," said he.&#xD;
" But, before Ispeak, permit me to ask you,&#xD;
do you hire an assassin to kihl an old and&#xD;
inoffensive man on a mere suspicion, or do&#xD;
your servants do so with your permission ?"&#xD;
fered looked somewhat displeased about&#xD;
this direct and perplexing question. Simon&#xD;
continued not, and Herod was obliged to&#xD;
say something. " Why do you ask me this&#xD;
question ?" h~e said.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Because,,if this is the ease," wtboe&#xD;
ply, " I must beg your permission  lieat&#xD;
this court, this city, this country."&#xD;
"To what particular ease do you have re-&#xD;
ference ?" the King asked.&#xD;
" In Jericho,.1 am informed,"saidimosn,&#xD;

Mariamne made no reply.   Displeasure&#xD;
and mortification were visibly depicted on&#xD;
her pale countenance. Alexandra, however,&#xD;
continued speaking on that topic and praised&#xD;
Mariamne's charms so much, that she ex-&#xD;
claimed in a tone of disgust, "The daughter&#xD;
of the Asmoneans, Israel's Queen, the moth-&#xD;
er of Judah's princes should vie with a har-&#xD;
lot for the favor of voluptuous Antony? No,&#xD;
I shall not. I prefer the scaffold to shame,&#xD;
and the greatest shame is that which we pro-&#xD;
cure with the charms God has bestowed on&#xD;
us, at the expense of innocence and purity.&#xD;
Mother, I caution you, not to bring misery&#xD;
upon yourself- and my grandfather, and&#xD;
shame upon your family. A princess should&#xD;
know how to die honorably and bravely for&#xD;
the glory of her house, in preference to liv-&#xD;

name of hei house. Let Cleopatra's name&#xD;
be handed over to infamy, the Asmonean&#xD;
sun shall have no spots on account of suffer-&#xD;
ing Mariamne. Mother, it appears as though&#xD;
we have changed parts in this tragedy. Let&#xD;
us. stop here."&#xD;
The earnest, high toned language of Mari-&#xD;
amne failed not to impress her mother with&#xD;
the conviction, that she could not be persua-'&#xD;
ded ;o leave Jerusalem, or turn a traitor to&#xD;
her husband. She gave the conversation&#xD;
another turn by speaking of the unexpected&#xD;
progress which the Essenean physician made&#xD;
so rapidly in Herod's favor. "AWe could de-.&#xD;
rive many a benefit from the young man,"&#xD;
said Alexandra, after awhile. "It appears to&#xD;
&#xD;
me, that he stands as high in the etimation&#xD;
of the people as in the favor of Herod. The&#xD;
people are our guardians, if they ha4 the&#xD;
power."&#xD;
"I remember now," said the Queen ud-&#xD;
denly, "when sick, lying in a state Qf -derle&#xD;
urn, he whispered in my ear,' the. people&#xD;
watch at your bedside.' It is true, there&#xD;
may be something better iq that man than I&#xD;
expected of his shrewdness: but, mother, I&#xD;
fear lie turned a traitor to us and the people,&#xD;
for he gained too fast the favor of Herod,&#xD;
Salome and Sabion. If he gained' their fa-&#xD;
vor by honest means and for upright purpo-&#xD;
ses, he plays a dangerous game, that Ma&#xD;
cost him his head. But still, I must uoW&#xD;
him. This is the advice I takeo(yo , moth-&#xD;
er; if Herod has evil intentions against the&#xD;
remains of my family, I will appeal to my&#xD;
people.. They will hear the daughter of&#xD;
Matatthia.  They have hearts, souls and&#xD;
arms. This last resort, this final appeal suits&#xD;
me. I must see that young Essenee.-Moth-&#xD;
er, do you know the Pharasee Hillel?&#xD;
" Pet, mention not the name of a man,"&#xD;
said Alexandra, "who is a horror to Sabion&#xD;
and Salome. Besides this," she continued,.&#xD;
whispering, "he is known as an opponent of&#xD;
Herod and a friend of the Asmdieans. His&#xD;
influence, notwithstanding his poverty, is&#xD;
great, very great. But what makes you ask&#xD;
this question ?"&#xD;
"The Essenee Physician is the= son of&#xD;
Hillel," the Queen answered.&#xD;
"Then we should, we must see and study&#xD;
him," said Alexandra. "The son can not&#xD;
be altogether averse to his father."&#xD;
"But we must be very careful with him,&#xD;
for lie is very shrewd," the Queen rema*ked.&#xD;
"Attempt to form his acquaintance, inquire&#xD;
into his purposes and intentions, and let us&#xD;
see what we can do with him."&#xD;

"You expressed the wish, my lady, to see&#xD;
me, and I gave myself the pleasure to make&#xD;
my appearance in your saloon. If you de-&#xD;

"Very polite, sir, and very obliging," said&#xD;
the lady. " When I wished to see you, it&#xD;

eril he was overpowered. He looked es-&#xD;

TI   PEOPLE,&#xD;
pecially with contempt upon Castobarus,&#xD;
who appeared to be the re-echo of the royal&#xD;
dame. The man with his small gray eyes&#xD;
and ever smiling countenance appeared to&#xD;
him like an automaton, whose locomotive&#xD;
power was the will of the lady. He remem-&#xD;
bered the description which Herod, in a&#xD;
moment of excitement, gave of his courtiers&#xD;
and servants; an exact specimen was now&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
"1I doubt, my lady," said Simon, "that I&#xD;
will meet, for a long time, with the favor of&#xD;
our sovereign.  The novelty of my plain&#xD;
and simple deportment will not please him&#xD;
long, I apprehend, and -I doubt that I over&#xD;
will be capable of acquiring that politeness,&#xD;
that courtesy and accomplishment, which&#xD;
distinguishes so eminently the hightoned la-&#xD;
dies and gentlemen of this court."&#xD;
" Wisdom and virtue stand aloof of all&#xD;
forms," said Salome, "because they need&#xD;
not that embellishment, in which empty&#xD;
heads and vicious hearts hide themselves.&#xD;
The King values the diamond but cares lit-&#xD;

" The King will appreciate and reward&#xD;
your services," said Castobarus, with a bow,&#xD;
"and the people's gratitude will be great&#xD;
and everlasting; for a people forget' not&#xD;
their benefactors."&#xD;
Simon deciphered at once the object of&#xD;
this conversation, and with the adroitness&#xD;
of a practiced courtier he responded, quick-&#xD;
ly, "I am fully satisfied with our monarch's&#xD;
grace and your kindness, for all the services&#xD;
I am capable to render. A service render-&#xD;
ed to a monarch must also be one to the&#xD;
people, for he is the people's head. The&#xD;

"So may God do unto us now and for ev- This is the meaning of the law, take its let-&#xD;

Menahem then narrated the story, how&#xD;
his sen was found slain in the city of Jeru-&#xD;
salem, and how several officers came to this&#xD;
city to arrest a Greek, as being the murder-&#xD;
er of his son, but the people insisted upon&#xD;
trying the case before the Sanhedrin of Je-&#xD;
richo.- He concluded with the considera-&#xD;
tion, that the Sanhedrin of Jericho had no&#xD;
right to try a man for crime which he&#xD;
committed in Jerusalem. He thought the&#xD;
duty of the Sanhedrin was to ordain that&#xD;
the Greek be placed before the Sanhedrin&#xD;
of Jerusalem.&#xD;
When Menahem had resumed his seat,&#xD;
Jonathan ben Uziel rose on the opposite&#xD;
side, and said, "It would not be right for&#xD;
me to rise and speak in the presence of so&#xD;
many sages of Israel, so much older and&#xD;
more learned than myself, if it was not as&#xD;

be said among the Gentiles, there is no jus-&#xD;

is, ' There shall -be one law and one statute&#xD;

The secretary read the argument of Xe.&#xD;
nahem, and his colleague read the reply of&#xD;
Jonathan to the listening judges and M  s1-&#xD;
lent spectators. This done, Menahem rose&#xD;
and replied; "Moses pointed on three cities&#xD;

led into an adjoining chamber, and one af-&#xD;
ter the other was examined and cross ex-&#xD;
amined. Aware of the severity of the law,&#xD;
and knowing the unexceptionable justice of&#xD;
the Pharasees, the-officers only stated, tlat&#xD;
they were sent to Jericho by Sabion, in the&#xD;
name of the lower Sanhedrin of Jerusalem,&#xD;
who considered the Greek guilty of the&#xD;
murder of Baruch ben Menahem. Noth-&#xD;
ing more could be learned of them. When&#xD;
Jonathan asked the multitude whether there&#xD;
were witnesses in favor of the Greek, two&#xD;
peasants came forward and told the story, -&#xD;
how they when taking the first fruits to Je-&#xD;
rusalem were arrested by the men now be-&#xD;
fore the judges, taking them for two other&#xD;
men, and how they were treated until a&#xD;
party of strangers rescued them from their&#xD;
hands in the Valley of Ilinom.&#xD;
It was evident to the initiated, that the'&#xD;
officers were the servants and spies of Sa-&#xD;
bion. The first idea of many was, those&#xD;
spies came for a double purpose, to arrest&#xD;
the Greek in order to remove the suspicion&#xD;
of murder from Herod and his servants,.and&#xD;
to ascertain the doings of the Pharasees&#xD;
at Jericho. Abba Shaul's testimony only&#xD;
confirmed that of the peasants, but threw&#xD;
no light on the principal point of the case.&#xD;
When Jonathan asked again, " Are there&#xD;
any more witnesses among you?" a boy&#xD;
whom Jonathan instantly recognized as the&#xD;
one who was his guardian angel in Jerusa-&#xD;
lem, came up and stated, "I am a servant&#xD;
of Sabion's daughter. I saw Baruch ben&#xD;
Menahem in the subterranean room of He-&#xD;
rod's palace. The men before you tortured&#xD;
him till he died. They executed the com-&#xD;
mand of Sabion, which he received of lie-&#xD;
rod. 1 administered the last drops of water&#xD;
to the parched lips of the expiring victim of&#xD;
wickedness. When 1 wept, yonder wretch-&#xD;
ed man dragged me out of the room, and&#xD;
there I heard the last groan of Baruch. So&#xD;
help me God, now and forever."&#xD;
Two men supported Menahem who sunk,&#xD;
fainting, from his seat. "1 can tell you&#xD;
still more," said the bay. "This Greek was&#xD;

dignation of the people became so loud and&#xD;
violent, that it was difficult even for Abba&#xD;
Shaul to conduct the four officers to their&#xD;
prison. Jonathan searched in vain among&#xD;
the crowd after the mysterious boy; he had&#xD;
disappeared.&#xD;
" I know everything thou cast tell me,"&#xD;
said Hillel to his son Simon, "The Greek&#xD;
proselyte has told me, how thou art the phy-&#xD;
sician and friend of Herod, and of several&#xD;
of his courtiers. Thou shouldst never have&#xD;
forgotten the admonition of thy father.&#xD;
Behold ! my mother was a daughter of the&#xD;
royal house of David, and my father was a&#xD;
nobleman of Benjamin, of King Saul, some&#xD;
maintain. When she died, and she was a&#xD;
great and good woman, Ahe called me to her&#xD;
couch, and bid me to bring honor upon our&#xD;
family. Her voice always re-echoed in my&#xD;
heart. As Joseph saw the portrait of his&#xD;
father when sin threatened to beguile him,&#xD;
so did I see on all occasions the picture of&#xD;
my dying mother, and heard her last words,&#xD;
'Bring honor uponour family.' I began to&#xD;
inquire after the meaning of those words,&#xD;
but was much puzzled with their ambigui-&#xD;
ty. To amass wealth, I thought, must 4e&#xD;

man did bow at the shrine of Mammon and&#xD;
its lucrative priests. But then I thought, is&#xD;
it really an honor to see my money respect-&#xD;
&#xD;
ces. I saw men high in rank and low in&#xD;
the scale of virtue, eminent in position and&#xD;
despicably low in the estimation of their fel-&#xD;
low men, honorable in dignity and disre-&#xD;
putable in thgir doings. Then I sawn. the&#xD;

C CHAPTER        VIii.&#xD;
THE DECISION oP THE PEOPLE.&#xD;
East of the Jordan river, opposite Jericho,&#xD;
Mount Nebo looks down upon the plain of&#xD;
Moab, and tells the glorious story of Israel's&#xD;
victories under the lead of Moses, the last&#xD;
days of that giant of antiquity, his death&#xD;
and mysterious burial. There is a cave in&#xD;
Mount Nebo, in which the prophets held&#xD;
their secret councils, when the Kings of Is-&#xD;
rael or Judah went astray; in that cave the&#xD;
prophet Elija was hid, and the people sur-&#xD;
rounded it with a thousand marvelous sto-&#xD;
ries. The cave after many windings, as-&#xD;
cends and descends, leads to a valley thro'&#xD;
which the Zered passes, a valley almost in-&#xD;
aceessible from any other point, as the Ze-&#xD;
red winds its way to it through perpendiou-&#xD;
lar rocks and narrow arches, and leaves it&#xD;
In the same manner. Thealm trees which&#xD;
crowd the fertile valley of a perpetual&#xD;
spring gave shelter and food to many fugi-&#xD;
tives. It was the principal place of meet&#xD;
ing for secret bodies. It was, therefore,&#xD;
called the valley of Zanaim, or the.humble.&#xD;
Many a solitary wanderer at that day bent&#xD;
his steps toward Nebo, some riding on as-&#xD;
ses, while others walked slowly over the&#xD;
plain with rude staffs in their hands. At&#xD;
she mysterious cave a fire burnt, around&#xD;
which some fantastical shepherds danced&#xD;
Whenever a stranger appeared. Then they&#xD;
would ask him, " Whence comet thou and&#xD;
whither doest thou go ?" If the stranger&#xD;
answered, "I come from the mountains and&#xD;
go to the valley," they would continue ask-&#xD;
4' lad what seekest thou inthe valley?'&#xD;
stranger answered, "-Light," and ad-&#xD;
1it " Nena," which are the initials of&#xD;
t     RWbrw verse, "The light of the Lofd&#xD;

same questions which Simon and Jonathan&#xD;
were asked on entering the secret hall un-&#xD;
f der the Temple of Jerusalem. The answers&#xD;
being correct they were given another lead-&#xD;
er to the valley of Zanaim. But if the an-&#xD;
swers could not be given they were led in-&#xD;
to a branch of the cave, where they were in-&#xD;
structed in the secrete and sworn to support&#xD;
the revolution.&#xD;
The valley was soon filled with a large&#xD;
number of bearded men, upon whose coun-&#xD;
tenances a solemn earnestness was enthron-&#xD;
ed. They stood or laid together in groups,&#xD;
and conversed on serious topics.&#xD;
"Hark! Jonathan ben Usiei speaks," said&#xD;
some. "He w'as in Alexandra and knows a&#xD;
great many new things." The crowd con-&#xD;
gregated around the speaker, who gave a&#xD;
full description of the grand preparations&#xD;
making by A ntony to meet the armies of&#xD;
Octavius. He said that Cleopatra promis-&#xD;
ed, none should interfere with the people of&#xD;
Jericho as long as it was under her protec-&#xD;
tion. She issued orders to give effect to her&#xD;
words. "She also promised her aid and co-&#xD;
operation in case of revolution against He-&#xD;
rod whom she hates violently. But all this&#xD;
is of no particular consequence to us, "Jon-&#xD;
athan continued, " for if Cleopatra aids us&#xD;
she will long after the land of Judah, and&#xD;
Antony will give it to her, if he is the only&#xD;
lord of the Roman empire. What pirot is&#xD;
it to us to serve Cleopatra instead of le-&#xD;
rod?"&#xD;
" First let us dethrone Herod," some of&#xD;
the crowd vociferated, " then let us talk of&#xD;
the intentions of Cleopatra."&#xD;
" So it is," said Jonathan, " we are strong&#xD;
enough to dethrone our tyrant. If An-&#xD;
tony is victorious, Cleopatra will prevent&#xD;
him at least from supporting Herod. If Oo-&#xD;
tavius is the hero of &amp;amp; e day, we have noth-&#xD;
lag to fear of him; for Herod supports An-&#xD;
thy: Cleopatra is a woman and resides in&#xD;

DAY OF ATONEMENT.&#xD;
The streets and lanes of Jerusalem were&#xD;
thronged with people at an early hour of,&#xD;
the morning. A checkered line of human&#xD;
beings floated through' the avenues, and&#xD;
rose like gigantic and variegated columns&#xD;
to Mount Mioriah, where the morning dawn&#xD;
was greeted with the powerful and harmo-&#xD;
nious accords of the levitioal chorus and&#xD;
orchestra. The Hallelujah of the mighty&#xD;
chorus was borne aloft to the blue vault of&#xD;
heaven, on the wings of harmonious music,&#xD;
in which the powerful notes of the trumpet,&#xD;
cornet, and drum were blended with sweet&#xD;
* sounds of the flute, the cymbal, harp and&#xD;
eytrum. Solemnly these currents of mu-&#xD;
sic re-echoed in the colossal dome, greeted&#xD;
and invited the thousands of pilgrims who&#xD;
hatuned toward the sacred spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
look followed the stately procession, buit&#xD;
none spoke or bowed.&#xD;
But when the Highpriest appeared in the&#xD;
white, sacerdotal vestments of the day, and&#xD;
approached the sacrifice between the UNam&#xD;
and the altar, a sacred awe appeared to&#xD;
electrify the multitude. The chorus and&#xD;
orchestra were silent, the myriads of wor-&#xD;
shippers presented a smooth sea untouched&#xD;
by the wings of the wind, the Highpriest&#xD;
laid his hand on the head of the sacrifice&#xD;
and confessing his sins he implored God's&#xD;
pardon with a loud and sonorous voice, con-&#xD;
eluding with the scriptural passage, "For&#xD;
this day I will be appeased unto you to pu-&#xD;
rify you from all your sins before God,"&#xD;
here he stopped abruptly;. for as he pro-&#xD;

-So the day was spent until the signal was&#xD;
given from the Temple roof, that the High-&#xD;
priest left the Temple, when the different&#xD;
groups and companies returned with song&#xD;
and music to the city.&#xD;
Simon and Jonathan went the whole day&#xD;
from one public place to another, to as-&#xD;
certain something of Helen's whereabouts.&#xD;
But in vain, they had discovered no trace,&#xD;
not even the remotest idea of her place of&#xD;
existence could be formed. But Jonathan&#xD;
had seen Elvira'in woman's dress. She ap-&#xD;
peared so beautiful to him, that he could&#xD;
not help thinking of her all day. They had&#xD;
returned to the city. Jonathan went to the&#xD;
place which Simon had told him to choose,&#xD;
and Simon went to the palace to see Herod.&#xD;
Arrived at the palace, Simon was request-&#xD;
ed to appear instantly before the Queen.&#xD;
This was a welcome opportunity to him, as'&#xD;
he expected to learn something about Helen.&#xD;
He repaired to the Queen's apartment with-&#xD;
out delay. He was admitted without cere&#xD;
mony. When he stepped into the brightly&#xD;
illuminated saloon and cast a shy look on&#xD;
the great and beautiful woman in the flow-&#xD;
ing white robe, who received him standing,&#xD;
a model statue of a model artiot--when his&#xD;
look met the large black eyes of the Queen&#xD;
staring obliquely on him, he inadvertently&#xD;
knelt down before the majestic daughter of&#xD;
the Asmoneans.&#xD;
"Rise and stand erect," said Mariamne,&#xD;
" none must bend his knee before a mortal&#xD;
being. This homage is due to God only."&#xD;
Simon rose and looked firmly into the&#xD;
countenance of the Queen. There wm a&#xD;
pride and a self-conscious majesty in that&#xD;
countenance, softened by features of the&#xD;
most tender goodness, which he had&#xD;
never observed before. "You are the im-&#xD;
age of God, my gracious Queen," said Si-&#xD;
mon in a fascinating tone, "I adore the&#xD;
Creator in His most perfect'likeness."&#xD;
The Queen smiled on remarking, "is thisn&#xD;
the language of the stern Esene or of th&#xD;
courtieri "&#xD;
&#xD;
" It is neither," Simon replied, quickly ;&#xD;
" for truth is not in the extremes."&#xD;
"Then let Hillel's son speak to me in his&#xD;
honest, free manner," said the Queen, while&#xD;
resuming a seat. "I know shit you have&#xD;
been my savior, when Herod suspected me&#xD;
of treachery. Elvira, in the anguish of her&#xD;
soul when Helen was lost, told me more&#xD;

sighed heavily and trembled v'atlently: He&#xD;
closed and opened his eyes several times in&#xD;
quick succession, and, seeing Helen always&#xD;
before him, he cried with all his strength,&#xD;
"Away, spirit of vengeance, and let me die&#xD;
in peace."&#xD;
"I am no spirit," Helen said, kindly lay-&#xD;
ing her hand upon his forehead. "Can I do&#xD;
nothing for you?"&#xD;
Again he opened his eyes and stared at&#xD;
her. Then he clasped her hand and asked&#xD;
her, "Did you escape ?"&#xD;
" I did, God rotected me," said Helen.-&#xD;
"And Adarmelech did not succeed ?"--the&#xD;
man asked, eagerly.&#xD;
Helen, blushed. " How do you know the&#xD;
schemes of that man ?" she inquired.&#xD;
" I brought him the command from Sa&#xD;

upon the violation of your person. She loves&#xD;

not to Jerusalem. Your ruin is inevitable.&#xD;
Pray for me, I die. I am a loathsome sin-&#xD;

dered at the gold-blooded wickedness of Sa-&#xD;
lome. A chill of terror and disgust coursed&#xD;
through'her blood on looking at the dead&#xD;
man before her. She remembered the scene'&#xD;
of scandal between her father, Salome and&#xD;
(astobarus, which nearly cost her liberty&#xD;
and life. She also remembered the wicked-&#xD;

"I saw yonder monster =prepare to leave&#xD;

Here I learned that he went to the country&#xD;
house of your father, and intended to follow&#xD;
him instantly, when the earthquake grew so&#xD;
furious, that we could not leave: In the&#xD;
confusion here, I heard the voice of Abba&#xD;
Shaul, and he told me that you were here."&#xD;
After an exchange of the fondest senti-&#xD;
ments, Helen first communicated the story&#xD;
of the last day. Then she spoke of the for-&#xD;
mer part of her story  On coming to the&#xD;
wife of the steward, Elvira interrupted her,&#xD;
" Is she alsodead ?" When Helen aflirned&#xD;
this, Elvira could not restrain her tears. On&#xD;
inquiry df Helen she said, that the woman&#xD;
was her nurse when she was quite young,&#xD;
hut she remembered distinctly her kindness&#xD;
and fondness of her.&#xD;
There was no time left for further explana-&#xD;
tion, for Abba Shaul came and urged them&#xD;
both to leave, which they did instantly. El-&#xD;
vira urged that all should return to Jerusa-&#xD;
lem, as the Queen would protect them against&#xD;
every harm. Abba Shaul, however, insisted,&#xD;
that Helen should go .to Jericho, and wait&#xD;
there until Simon be infornned of lier fate,&#xD;
and he should tell where- she shloul4 go.-&#xD;
Helen preferred the latter. Elvira vs sent&#xD;
to Jerusalem with the instruction to inform&#xD;
none except the Queen and Simon of Helen's&#xD;
escape, and Helen;followed Abba Shaul to-&#xD;

o::: advice Hillel, our great teacher is his&#xD;
'ounsellor, and will appear for him before&#xD;
the Sanhedrin. Herod sent a written-grant,&#xD;
that under no consideration should Hillel be&#xD;
harmed, and after the trial he should go&#xD;
back unmolested to Jericho. Although they&#xD;
have no men to oppose effectually the argu-&#xD;
ments of Hillel, we still apprehend fatal con-&#xD;
sequences, as almost the whole Sanhedrin&#xD;
consists of Herod's creatures. Still we shall&#xD;
be watchful on this point. The most impor-&#xD;
tant point of my mission is to inform you,&#xD;
that Sabion has dispatched a body of men&#xD;
to bring you to Jerusalem alive or dead.-&#xD;
You are lost if you come to Jerusalem."&#xD;

" I am prepared for all eventualities. But.&#xD;
my friend, laaIae you no tidings of Abba&#xD;
Shaul, none of Helen?"&#xD;
None,' said Jonathan with a sad look.-&#xD;
"None can imagine whither Abba Shaul has&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
The conversation was interrupted by a&#xD;
noisy dispute a Simon's door. lie opened&#xD;

"Then you refuse to go with me?" the of-&#xD;

" You understood me right," Simon repli-&#xD;

gathered about the house, listening impa-&#xD;

him again to pay obedience to the laws of&#xD;

then commanded the crowd to give way,&#xD;
that he might do his duty, in arresting a&#xD;
man who was accused of high treason, and&#xD;
place him before the tribunal of justice.-&#xD;
Hisses, groans and menaces were the replies&#xD;
of the people.&#xD;
Simon retired to his room. Jonathan said&#xD;
to the people, " Know it, ye sons of "Abra-&#xD;

the King's vile spy, the bloody enemy of 4s-&#xD;

was his time to carry out his schemes. He&#xD;
sat in his easy chair one morning and heard,&#xD;
the several reports of his servants with a&#xD;
self-complacent air. After he was through&#xD;
and the servants were dismissed, he called&#xD;
Elvira. She appeared. Sabion Basked her,&#xD;
" Will you now tell me all you know about&#xD;
Helen and Aurion ?"&#xD;
"You know more than I do, sir," said&#xD;
Elvira. " I can tell you nothing. But if I&#xD;
could, Iwould not do it."&#xD;
"Ah, I know of proper means to bend the&#xD;
obstinacy of such creatures," said 6abion.'&#xD;
" The torture, Miss, the torture will teach&#xD;
you to speak."  Elvira made no reply.--&#xD;
" Will you answer my questions ?"&#xD;
"No," was the brief answer. "Your con-&#xD;
temptible menaces frighten me nat. Since&#xD;
you threaten I shall not speak at all."&#xD;
" Then I will not threaten," said Sabion,&#xD;
" I will promise. If you tell me what you&#xD;
know, I will elevate you to the first lady of&#xD;
the court. The women shall envy, the men'&#xD;
shall respect you, as the most powerful, most&#xD;
influential, most happy lady at court. Ev-&#xD;
ery look of yours shall set a host of servants&#xD;
in motion. The finest silks of Damascus,&#xD;
the linen of Egypt, the purple of India, the&#xD;
pearls of Persia, the costliest diamonds, the&#xD;
most precious rubies shall be yours. I will&#xD;
make you my wife."&#xD;
Elvira laughed so heartily that Sabion'&#xD;
stopped abruptly. "This is a mast cruel&#xD;
torture you have invented," she said; "in-&#xD;
deed if I fear anything, it is certainly this&#xD;
torture. Your wife ? What a hell there is&#xD;
in these two words ! 0, do not deceive your-&#xD;
self, my 'lord, you are so old and ugly, so&#xD;
despicable and monstrous, that to be your&#xD;
wife is to be wedded to hell and the prince&#xD;
of darkness."&#xD;
" Never mind,. Elvira," Sabion ejaculated.&#xD;
"First,,tell me what you know of Hel-&#xD;
en, then you will be my wife. I am lord,&#xD;

can do, if despair drives her .to it."&#xD;
"You shall stay in your room for three&#xD;
lays," said Sabion; "some gentlemen and&#xD;
ladies are appointed to keep you safely. I&#xD;
have urgent business just now. After three&#xD;
days, I will marry you. Farewell."&#xD;
" During three days it might please his&#xD;
Satanic majesty to recall his representative&#xD;
on earth to the hellish palace," said Elvira,&#xD;
when she retired.&#xD;
" Then I will take you along," said Sabion.&#xD;
When Elvira was gone he soliloquized, "She&#xD;
must know more than I do; for she was in&#xD;
Sharon and that hellish Aurion came with&#xD;
her, or soon after her from there. They&#xD;
must know whether she is dead."&#xD;
Knocking on the secret door was heard ;&#xD;
Sabion opened and admitted a man.  Ah,&#xD;
you returned quickly. What news do you&#xD;
bring from-the plain of Sharon?"&#xD;
9 Disastrous,very disastrous," said thestran-&#xD;

soldiers sent there will ever return. Some&#xD;
are killed, and the rest frat  rnized with the&#xD;

" And they did not return with you ? "--&#xD;
Sabion asked.&#xD;
"Return? there was none there to return,"&#xD;
said the man; " for their defeat occurred&#xD;
just when they arrived on the plain and at-&#xD;
tempted to arrest Aurion."&#xD;
"A'nd all the reports I received after.&#xD;

" Were lies, mere fabrications of your en-&#xD;

made no clearer to the Sanhedrin, than the&#xD;
present testimony did. The connection of&#xD;
Hyroan with the enemy of the country in&#xD;
time of actual war, the acceptance of the&#xD;
horses sent by Malchus, the orders to his&#xD;
servants to prepare speedily to leave the city,&#xD;
the promise of office to so many of his&#xD;
friends, and the assurance that he would be&#xD;
King in a few months, leave no room to doubt&#xD;
the guilt of Hyrcan.&#xD;
Hillel rose and said, that the argument&#xD;
just heard would be conclusive, if the prem-&#xD;
ises were true. He proposed to prove, that&#xD;
not one of the premises was t. ne. The pri-&#xD;
vate scribe of Hyrcan testified, that the old&#xD;
King was incapable to write, more than three&#xD;
years past, partly on account of his weak eye-&#xD;
sight, and partly on account of trembling'&#xD;
hands. The letter to the King of Arabia&#xD;
must have been written years ago. Upon in-&#xD;
vestigation it was found by many witnesses&#xD;
that names and date were skilfully changed&#xD;
in the letter. Another witness stated, that&#xD;
the Arab was a horse trader, commonly1&#xD;
,known as such in Jerusalem, and never was&#xD;
an agent of the King of Arabia. Next an&#xD;
'Arabian Israelite was heard who stated that&#xD;

of Hyrcan ever since Herod was tried before&#xD;
the Sanhedrin for acts committed in Galilee.&#xD;
lUut on being appointed by his friends to as-&#xD;
certain the sentiments of Hyrcan as to the&#xD;
future government of Israel, because the wit-&#xD;
ness and his friends consider the present&#xD;
government a violent and unjust imposition&#xD;
on the people, he did not directly offer to&#xD;
Hlyrcan the aid of his friends in again&#xD;
mounting the throne of his fathers, but&#xD;
would first ascertain his sentiments on the&#xD;
subjects. Hyrcan, however, expressed such&#xD;
an aversion to public life, and considered&#xD;
himself so happy that he could conclude his&#xD;
days in the peace of private life, that wit-&#xD;
ness could not propose the wishes of his&#xD;
friends to the old King. Several interviews&#xD;
leadi ig to the same result, witness advised&#xD;
his friends to try no inure, as Hyrcan had&#xD;
grown too old and weak to be a King.&#xD;

he could not be confused. Ile said the same&#xD;
thing always again. Without the least to-&#xD;
ken of fear he stated his objections to the&#xD;
government of Herod and his wish to see&#xD;
him dethroned. Hillel declared the evidence&#xD;
on the part of the defence as concluded.-&#xD;
Every word of the testimony was known in&#xD;
Jerusalem, notwithstanding the closed doors&#xD;
of the Sanhedrin.  Baba ben Buta was&#xD;
borne in triumph from the Temple to his&#xD;
house. The forged letter, the hired prose-&#xD;
lytes and -reatgs of Sabion formed the&#xD;
common theme of 'conversation. There was&#xD;
an indignation audible in the' community,&#xD;
which was threatening. "The public feasts&#xD;

"My venerable father and teachersaid&#xD;
Simon, "yoe-taught me, to save a human&#xD;
life is-a moressacred duty than to observe&#xD;
all-the-Sabbaths of a lifetime., You taught&#xD;
nye that even, in cae of. doubt--man may&#xD;
violate the Sabbath, if he believes thus. to&#xD;
save the life of a human being."&#xD;
" I did say so, and this is the meaning of&#xD;
the Law : ' What-man should do to live by&#xD;
it,' and not to die.with'it. Self-preservation&#xD;
is man's first duty. 'Love thy neighbor as&#xD;
thyself,' implies.first the duty to preserve she&#xD;
life of our fellow men as well as ours. - Hence&#xD;
the perservation of life ia man's first duty.&#xD;
But tell me, my son, whose life art thou to&#xD;
save ?"&#xD;
"Hyrcan's, my father," said Simon. " I&#xD;
prevailed so long on Herod until he appoin-&#xD;
ted me governor of Jerusalem and pardon-&#xD;
ed Hyrcan. I bear the documents. I can&#xD;
save the life of Hyrcan and of many others&#xD;
who die now in Jerusalem almost every day,&#xD;
for no offence of theirs."&#xD;
"Thea go, travel fast, be in time in Jeru-&#xD;
salem, andamay God speed thee," Hillel ex-&#xD;
claimed, joyfully. " All good men in Israel&#xD;
will bless thee, and Herod's name might yet&#xD;
be saved from perdition." Instantly Hillel&#xD;
looked serious and deliberating. After a&#xD;
mormept of reflection, he asked, " But why&#xD;
didst thou not go the straight rout from Pe-&#xD;
tra to Jerusalem ? "&#xD;
"Notwithstanding the decrees of the King,&#xD;
signed by him, gnd bearing his seal,' haid, i-&#xD;
men, "nothwithstanding my traveliug4h a&#xD;

men, who evidently obeyed the behests of&#xD;
Herod. I fear my son, thou art deceived."&#xD;
Like a flash of lightning it rushed through&#xD;
the soul of Simon. He rose from his seat&#xD;
and looked about like one who feels-the ap.&#xD;
proach of insanity. "Is it possible that He.&#xD;
rod is do perfidious, so outrageously satanic,&#xD;
such a feeble, weak, hellish liar I" Simon&#xD;
exclaimed, furiously. "Yet it appears to be&#xD;
as my sagacious father says. Herod,-tlien,&#xD;
dig thy grave, thou art a lost man. This&#xD;
pardon alone could save him. 0, my fath-&#xD;
er, my kind father, you know not how my&#xD;
soul mourns over that Herod, how I dread&#xD;
the idea of the bloody revolution, that must&#xD;
ensue. 0, 1 hoped to save him, to spare my&#xD;
people the lives of the thousand patriots.-&#xD;
It was. a sweet, pleasant. dream. If Herod&#xD;
isa-liar,-then the dream is over, and the&#xD;
sword, the bloody sword will decide the fate&#xD;
of Israel." Simon covered his face with&#xD;
his hands and wept so loud, that all in the&#xD;
room wept with;him. Painful was the si-&#xD;
lence that followed, and the emotions that&#xD;
appeared to dominate every heart. Then&#xD;
he burst forth violently, " Israel, curse the&#xD;
infamous seducers of Herod ! Israel, curse&#xD;
Salome, Dositheus, Castobarus, curse Sabi-&#xD;
on "&#xD;
The shrill and painful cry of Helen, "Hold&#xD;
on, for God's sake, hold on, he is-my father!"&#xD;
directed every look to her. " Simon, save&#xD;
him, I prithee, save his life, he is my father.&#xD;

" Murderer ? No 1I" Simon said, emphati-&#xD;
cally. "The man whomurdered thousands,&#xD;

Helen embraced Hillel and hiswife. "Be&#xD;

my soul at the fire of your virtues, and be&#xD;
worthy to be your child."&#xD;
" So may God 'bless thee, as I love thee,"&#xD;
said Hillel. -"Helen, we are thy parents,&#xD;

" Not a word, my lord," said Castobarus.&#xD;
" She mounted the carriage, took her child-&#xD;
ren in her arms, kissed them and away the&#xD;
chariot rolled."&#xD;
"Not a single word she said?" Herod&#xD;
asked again. "Speak, man, did she not&#xD;
weep, not sigh, not request you to see me&#xD;
only for a moment?"&#xD;
"She said nothing, did not weep nor sigh,"&#xD;
Castobarus replied. " When I handed' her&#xD;
your decree she bowed slightly, and said, 'I&#xD;
am ready to depart.' Since then I have not&#xD;
heard her speak."&#xD;
" Castobarus, have you a wife and child-&#xD;
ren ?" the King as'ced, suddenly. .&#xD;
"No, my lord," was the courtier's reply.&#xD;
" Then go, you do not understand me,"&#xD;
the King said. "Go send me a man who is&#xD;
a husband and a father. But no, stay. I&#xD;

Suddenly he turned to Castobarus with&#xD;
the command " Call Sabion hither, I must&#xD;
see him." Sabion was ushered into his pres.&#xD;
ence.&#xD;
" You are an obstinate sinner," said HE-&#xD;
rod, "you intended to sell me and Judea to&#xD;
Cleopatra. But she is dead and you repent.&#xD;
Is it not so, Sabion ?"&#xD;
" My lord, I am yours with all my life,"&#xD;
said Sabion, kneeling before the King.-&#xD;
" Command and I will die for you, without a&#xD;
groan."&#xD;
"Sabion, have you heard of the defeat of&#xD;
Shemus, by the rebels ?" the King asked.&#xD;
" I have, my lord," was the reply.&#xD;
"Sohemus says their number is formida-&#xD;
ble," the King quothed. " An attack upon&#xD;
Jerusalem is in contemplation. They can&#xD;
not take Jerusalem. But they might do us&#xD;
much harm in the country. What is your&#xD;
advice, shall I wait until they attack Jerusa-&#xD;
lem, or shall I go out in person to meet them&#xD;
in open battle before they concentrate their&#xD;
forces ?"&#xD;
"It would not do for the King to fight his&#xD;
own people," said Sabion. " Your enemies&#xD;
'n the country are so very few, tat they can&#xD;
not even bring together men enough to be&#xD;
called an army. Sohemus went with a few&#xD;
men to Jericho, and being defeated he con.&#xD;
ciders the numbers of the enemy formidable.&#xD;
You are too much feared and respected in&#xD;
the country to be betrayed by the multitude.&#xD;
Keep the city safe, concentrate your army&#xD;
around it, and watch their movements, is my&#xD;
advice."&#xD;
"So is my inclination," said Herod.--'&#xD;
" But f they besiege the city,'what then ?"&#xD;
" Then you have more than 'the required&#xD;
forces to drive them to pairs,'' said Sabion.&#xD;

ante. ered held a council in his palace,&#xD;
to determine upon the steps to be taken the&#xD;
nextday. Theydeliberated forseveral hours&#xD;
and came to the conclusipn, that Zion could&#xD;
be efectually defended and the rebels could&#xD;
be subdued yet, to which end 'a plan was&#xD;
adopted&amp;amp; The King, however, insisted up-&#xD;
on commanding in person and be prepared&#xD;
for all eventualities. He commanded Sohe-&#xD;
mus to leavathe city with an adequate force&#xD;
pud go to the fort of Alexandrium, where&#xD;
the Queen and her children were. He com-&#xD;
manded Soheugus to hold the fort at any&#xD;
risk. As soon as he should be convinced of&#xD;
the King's death, he should kill Mariacnne,&#xD;
her children ander mother. Soheuaus&#xD;
knelt down and swore a solemn oath to car-&#xD;
ry out punctually the command of the King.&#xD;
Before the morning dawned Sohemnus with&#xD;
his men had left the city, unobserved by the&#xD;
enemy.&#xD;
Then the King called Castobaras and&#xD;
charged him with the duty to convey his&#xD;
mother Cyprus and his sister Salome to the&#xD;
fort of Masado, to keep that fort at any&#xD;
risk, protect the royal family, and in case of&#xD;
the King's death to proclaim Antipater, the&#xD;
King's son by his first wife Doris, King of&#xD;
Israel.&#xD;

so loudly, that she could not safely be con-&#xD;

the arrangements had been completed to&#xD;
convey the royal family out of the city to&#xD;
the appointed fort, and Salome continued&#xD;
raging most furiously and crying most vio-&#xD;
lently, "Give me Aurion or death," the King,&#xD;
her mother begged and threatened in vain,&#xD;
she only became more desperate and furi-&#xD;
ous with every passing moment. The hours&#xD;
of the night passing away rapidly, the morn-&#xD;
ing was fast approaching, no time was to be&#xD;
lost. Herod commanded to gag her; her&#xD;
hands tied, her mouth gaged, three men sei-&#xD;
zed the furious woman, placed her in the&#xD;
carriage at the side of her mother, and the&#xD;
whole train, commanded by Castobarus, star-&#xD;
ted off with the utmost speed, and escaped&#xD;
without being noticed by the enemy.&#xD;
Herod almost wept over the agony of his&#xD;
sister, but he could not help her. Circum-&#xD;
stances required, that Castobarus should be&#xD;
tied closely to the royal family, whose chief&#xD;
interests were plated in his hands. While&#xD;
he was still lost in a train of painful tho'ts&#xD;
a servant opened the door and asked shily,&#xD;
" My lord, what shall be done with the bo-&#xD;
dy of Elvira, your sister left no orders ?"&#xD;
Herod shuddered. He covered his eyes&#xD;
with his left hand and exclaimed, "She is&#xD;
avenged." Turning after awhile to the ser-&#xD;
vant he said, " Bury her by the side of Sa-&#xD;
bion in his family sepulcher." Two large&#xD;
tears glittered in the eyes of Herod. When&#xD;
the servant was gone he inadvertantly ex-&#xD;
claimed, "'There is a God of justice, but He-&#xD;
rod is lost." : Frightened as it were at his&#xD;
own words he violently struck the handle of&#xD;
f his 'word.. Dositheus, understanding this .&#xD;

ed no remark. When the morning dawned&#xD;
on Mt. Zion, the gates of the city were all&#xD;
opened, the soldiers fraternized with the&#xD;
people, and Herod was gone, none knew&#xD;
whither. The people-shouted with joy, but&#xD;
the joy was not without tears. In the fort&#xD;
of Antiochus a guard of honor surrounded&#xD;
a dead man. He bled from many wounds,&#xD;
and closing his eyes in death he shouted&#xD;
yet, " We are victorious."  With awe and&#xD;
reverence the warriors looked at the dead&#xD;
Hero, and many a tear coursed down hardy&#xD;
and sun burnt cheeks.. It was the dead bo-&#xD;
dy of Abba Shaul, who fell during the storm-&#xD;
ing of the fort, pierced by the arrows of the&#xD;
enemy. He died the death of a hero, with&#xD;
the words of " onward for God and Israel"&#xD;
on his lips.&#xD;
In the midst of the excited and joyful&#xD;
crowds, Helen ran from street to street in&#xD;
search of Simon, but found him not. De-&#xD;
spairing and tearless, she arrived at the roy-&#xD;
al palace where she found the dead bodies&#xD;
of Elvira and her father. She covered the&#xD;
countenances of both with tears andkisses,&#xD;
and lamented over them in mute pain. The&#xD;
thundering shouts of joy and victory resoun-&#xD;
ding through the streets disturbed her not.&#xD;
The warbling of the trumpets to signalize&#xD;
the people's victory 'alleviated not her pain.&#xD;
The outbursts of an unlimited enthusiasm&#xD;
which rent the air of Jerusalem reached'not&#xD;
Helen's suffering heart. " My father, my&#xD;
sister," were the only words she could ut-&#xD;
ter. A voice was heard in the arched halls&#xD;
&#xD;
of the palace, a voice so well known to Hel-&#xD;
en. She listened. Again he spoke.. She&#xD;
opened the door and cried "Simon. Hus-&#xD;
band, here, heroes your wife," and Simon&#xD;
heard it, he came and seized her as a hung-&#xD;
ry lion grasps after the prey. tThen you&#xD;
live yet, my dearest, only beloved. Helen,"&#xD;
Simon cried. " In vrain-have I soughtthee,&#xD;
in vain sent twenty messengers toand thee;&#xD;
all said you fell on the side of Abba Shaul.&#xD;
Thank God you live,- you are here, and&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
Mute Helen pointed to the dead lying&#xD;
in the room. Simon pressed Heln on his&#xD;
heart, and wept with her. Then he com-&#xD;
manded the servants of Sabion to remove&#xD;
the bodies to the very sepulchre which He-i-&#xD;
rod had ordained.&#xD;
The Passover was a feast of joy and vie-&#xD;
tory for the people. The happiest days of&#xD;
Israel appeared to have returned. Also Hel-&#xD;
en was healed- from her grief by the enthu-&#xD;
siasm generally prevailing, the love and ten-&#xD;
derness of: Simon,' who  as overhappy at&#xD;
the side of his beloved wife, and the pious&#xD;
consolation of Hillel who, notwithstanding&#xD;
the numerous congratulations he was obli-&#xD;
ged to receive, had yet time enough to at-&#xD;
tend sometimes to his family.&#xD;
We may meet again with Simon, Helen&#xD;
and Jonathan ben Uuiel in another story';&#xD;
but for this time we must part with them,&#xD;
and bid our readers FAREWELL.&#xD;
