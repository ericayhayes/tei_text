CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"And they who for their country die&#xD;
Shall ill an honored grave ;&#xD;
For glory lights thesoldiers tomb,&#xD;
And beauty weeps the brave !"&#xD;
It was night, and in a dense grove of scrub-&#xD;
by pines, about a mile back from the main&#xD;
road which led from Suffolk, through Wind-&#xD;
sor to the old Blackwater Bridge, in Virgin-&#xD;
ia, there was a group and a scene which&#xD;
would have made a fine "study" for a paint-&#xD;
cr. A cheerful fire was burning in an open&#xD;
space in the dense grove, and about it&#xD;
were gathered a party of just eighteen&#xD;
men ; men whose blue jackets, trimmed&#xD;
with yellow braid, as well as their short&#xD;
carbines, loaded revolvers and steel-seab-&#xD;
barded sabres, as also the spurs on their&#xD;
heels, revealed the arm of the Federal serv-&#xD;
ice to which they belonged as cavalry,&#xD;
Their horses were fastened to trees just&#xD;
outside of the little circle of cleared ground,&#xD;
and were munching away at the oats in their&#xD;
nose-bags, with an avidity that showed they&#xD;
had not been fed very lately.&#xD;
Over the fire around which the men were&#xD;
grouped, there were several chickens and&#xD;
turkeysroasting or broiling; and two or three&#xD;
small Oioats lay dressed in the background,&#xD;
from which the men cut slices now and then,&#xD;
which they roasted on sticks cut from the&#xD;
trees near at hand. Tin cups of coffee were&#xD;
also simmering on the coals, and such of the&#xD;
men as wanteI a taste of "apple-jack" had&#xD;
only to gO to one of a half-dozen canteens&#xD;
that hung from a limb near by, to find a sip&#xD;
of that favorite Virginian beverage.&#xD;
By their dress, it could be seen that all of&#xD;
these men were privates except one, and he&#xD;
did not wear "shoulder-straps".&#xD;
The one who made the exception only&#xD;
wore the chevrons of a sergeant, but on his&#xD;
right fore aim was the gold bar, known as&#xD;
&#xD;
the battle-stripe, a mark of honor given to&#xD;
denote that he had distinguished himself in&#xD;
action against the enemy-an honor, too,&#xD;
shared by most of his companions, for they&#xD;
also wore a similar golden stripe on their&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
And now, reader, as they are to be your&#xD;
companions for some time, allow me to intro-&#xD;
duce you to sergeant Ernest Clifford and lilt&#xD;
companions, as the picked scouts of the&#xD;
Mounted Rifles ; a body of men more hated&#xD;
and dreaded by the Rebels on the Blackwater&#xD;
and Chowan line than any other men in the&#xD;
Federal Army, for the graybacks never knew&#xD;
when or where to find them, but often did&#xD;
find them where they least expected or want-&#xD;
ed to.&#xD;
. There were two more men belonging to&#xD;
this party, but they were out near the road&#xD;
on picket-guard, watching the only point&#xD;
from which the party around the fire could&#xD;
be attacked ; for in the rear of the pine-grove,&#xD;
and flanking it also on both sides, was an&#xD;
immense cypress-swamp, alike impervious&#xD;
to man or horse. The two guards were so&#xD;
posted that they could see any parties which&#xD;
passed along the road ; and as they were re-&#xD;
lieved by comrades every two hours, and it&#xD;
was not a stormy night, though a cloudy one,&#xD;
their duty was not very hard.&#xD;
But tieir position was not without its&#xD;
perils. They were fifteen miles from the&#xD;
pickets of the Army at Suffolk, and within&#xD;
two or three miles of the pickets of the Rebel&#xD;
Army.&#xD;
Gen. Roger Pryor, of bowie-knife-declen-&#xD;
sion notoriety, when he was a dueling M. C.,&#xD;
was in command of a brigade of infantry, a&#xD;
couple of regiments of cavalry, and two or&#xD;
three batteries of artillery, all within a few&#xD;
miles of this secluded spot ; and he made fre-&#xD;
quent advances toward our lines either for&#xD;
forage for his men and horses, to disturb the&#xD;

few Unionists outside of our lines, or to&#xD;
threaten our pickets and disturb our forces&#xD;
at Suffolk, always falling back when force&#xD;
n a3 sent to fight him.&#xD;
To watch him, cut off his scouts, and occa-&#xD;
.ionally drive in his pickets, and to make&#xD;
them believe that the Yankees were coming&#xD;
in force, was the business of Sergeant Clit-&#xD;
sord and his brother-scouts ;inc picked&#xD;
from the whole regiment for their mntelli-&#xD;
gence, courage, skilfin horsemanship and in&#xD;
the use of their weapons. Not one of them&#xD;
but ltd come from happy homes and the en-&#xD;
jovuent of luxury in their native Empire&#xD;
. date to sei e as volunteers in the  s ar ; not&#xD;
one of theta that w £ not, by education,&#xD;
birth, and association, when at home, a gein-&#xD;
tltman.&#xD;
All of them young. all Americans, it would&#xD;
cemi strange to foreigners of a similar class&#xD;
in society, to see them not only acting as&#xD;
privates, but choosing the most arduous and&#xD;
perilous duty which could be found in the&#xD;
Army, of their own free will-the most ar-&#xD;
duous, the most dangerous, therefore far the&#xD;
most exciting and the most honorable.&#xD;
I cannot at present introduce all of them to&#xD;
you by name, but there are a couple sitting&#xD;
there on a log with the Sergeant, one on each&#xD;
.sde of him, who may as well be made&#xD;
known to you by name now as later, for&#xD;
you will know a good deal of them in a short&#xD;
time.&#xD;
They arc both very ditTerent-looking from&#xD;
the Scrgeant, who, by the way, is the oldest&#xD;
nian ofhis party, being well on toward forty&#xD;
years of age.  Ills dark-brown hair and&#xD;
mustache shade a face on which several scars&#xD;
are seen, and his bronzed visage has a care&#xD;
amid tne s orin look. This is not his first&#xD;
war, and he has seen years of hardship be-&#xD;
fore lie took the saddle to help put down this&#xD;
rebellion.&#xD;
The young man on his right, George&#xD;
Bruce, has not numbered over three-and-&#xD;
twenty years of life : there is no shadow on&#xD;
his bright brow, no care in the dancing light&#xD;
of his keen black eye, and were it not for the&#xD;
:car of a sabre-cut, which has left a livid&#xD;
mark across his right cheek from the brow&#xD;
to the chin, his face would be pronounced&#xD;
faultlessly liandsomoe. His figure is a marvel&#xD;
of strength and beauty ;tamt his expression&#xD;
dletnotes a fearless spirit and a superahund-&#xD;
ance of fun in his nature. Ills long black&#xD;
hair curls naturally about his neck and&#xD;
shoulders, and shines glossily in the light of&#xD;
the blazing camp-fire.&#xD;
He has a  art of a broiled chicken in one&#xD;
hand, a hard biscuit in the other, and on the&#xD;
ground before him smokes his tin cup of&#xD;
coffee.&#xD;
On the left of the Sergeant sits another&#xD;
&#xD;
roman, John Dolan, who is probably a little&#xD;
older than Bruce-at any rate, he looks more&#xD;
sage and serious. You would say at a&#xD;
glance that the Churc had lost a preacher&#xD;
when he chose the sabre of steel in lieu of&#xD;
the "sword of the Gospel". His light-brown&#xD;
hair was cut short, revealing a well-shaped&#xD;
head and a very high and broad forehead.&#xD;
His features were large and strongly indica-&#xD;
tive of a very firm, resolute, and serious&#xD;
character. His frame was stout and mascu-&#xD;
line, his height a little less than that of either&#xD;
of his immediate c impanions.&#xD;
IHe also, like them, was occupied with his&#xD;
supper, eating slowly, and talking in his usual&#xD;
slow way while he ate.&#xD;
"Sergeant," said he, speaking so slow that&#xD;
it seemed as if utterance was a labor, "do you&#xD;
mean to stay here all night ?"'&#xD;
"Pretty nearly, if there is no alarm from&#xD;
the outpost!" replied Clifford. "We've had&#xD;
a long ride to-day, and the horses had a pret-&#xD;
ty hard run when we had to skedaddle down&#xD;
there at (Jarsville. If there had been only a&#xD;
squadron instead of a full battalion of Rebs,&#xD;
I would rather have fought them than to&#xD;
have run our horses so hard. But twenty&#xD;
men against four hundred is rather too great&#xD;
odds even for the Rifles ! I want to let the&#xD;
horses rest a few hours, if possible, for we&#xD;
may have another run iif we beat up their&#xD;
pickets at Zuni to-morrow!"&#xD;
"Well, I am sure I had rather rest thiam&#xD;
ride to-night ' said Dolan. "it wil not be&#xD;
may 'relie' until five o'clock in the morn-&#xD;
ing, and if I sleep until then, I'll feel like a&#xD;
new tian!"&#xD;
"'Well, say your prayers and ground your-&#xD;
self !" said Bruce, with a laugh. " I have to&#xD;
go on guard at ten, and I shant try to sleep&#xD;
till my turn is over t"&#xD;
" If you said ?your prayers oftener, and swor'-&#xD;
less, you'd be m a better way than you are'&#xD;
said Dolan, quietly, as he drank oil the last of&#xD;
his cofee ; and then, taking his blanket from&#xD;
the log upon which lie had been sittiig,he&#xD;
threw it down on the ground and laidim-&#xD;
self upon it, with his feet toward the fire.&#xD;
"I reckon John is right !" said Bruce, with&#xD;
a laugh. "But I never wasmade for a saint.&#xD;
so I must remain a sinner. I've been think-&#xD;
ing half the afternoon where my spirit&#xD;
would be now, if that bullet which ventilated&#xD;
my hat when we came on the Rebels so stid-&#xD;
denly this mornii, had gone three or four&#xD;
inches lower than it did, and made a hole in&#xD;
ny brain-pan !"&#xD;
"You wouldn't have lost any brains if it&#xD;
had !" said Dolan, with a quiet smile on his&#xD;
fakse. lie never indulged in anything nearer&#xD;
to a laugh.&#xD;
"Now, John, that is positively cruel&#xD;

me which kept her up. I have no need of&#xD;
her services in my room at night, though she&#xD;
always dresses me in the morning."&#xD;
"1 a afraid, if you and our folks intend to&#xD;
remain here on the old place much longer,&#xD;
that you'll have to do without her services&#xD;
and ihat of nl the rest of the niggers that are&#xD;
woith anything !" said the Major.&#xD;
" Why so? io without Elise 'No, brother.&#xD;
I could not do that-she is as necessary to&#xD;
me as my food. I couldn't dress myself de-&#xD;
c'ently without her aid. She always does up&#xD;
my hair and makes my dresses ; and though&#xD;
her mother is very handy at washing and&#xD;
ironing, and better as a house-servant than&#xD;
any woman in the county, she never was&#xD;
half so smart or handy as my Elise. Oh no ;&#xD;
I can never part with her !"&#xD;
" But we expect that the Yankees will&#xD;
move up this way in force soon ; and if they&#xD;
do, and we have to fall back to our fortified&#xD;
lines, then what will become of Elise and the&#xD;
rest of the hands ?"&#xD;
"Why, brother, the Yankees have been&#xD;
here, pass here on scouts every day or two;&#xD;
and as we profess to be neutral, they never&#xD;
interfere with us !"&#xD;
"Because they have not done so yet, is no&#xD;
sign that they never will. They have taken&#xD;
nggers and freed them wherever they've&#xD;
taken possession ; and it is not likely they'd&#xD;
leave a girl that is as pretty as Elise long un-&#xD;
noticed, especially if they find out that she is&#xD;
a slave! Our Commanding General told me&#xD;
she other day that if he saw any sure signs&#xD;
that the enemy meant to advance in force, he&#xD;
should sweep the country of niggers and&#xD;
horses before he fell back. I think that you'd&#xD;
better all go to Richmond. You can at least&#xD;
save our slave-property, and be free from the&#xD;
annoyance of Yankee intrusion. For they'll&#xD;
never see Richmond as conquerors while old&#xD;
Bob Lee is alive!"&#xD;
"I cannot leave this plantation, and my&#xD;
till and barns, and this house and all its fur-&#xD;
niture !" said the elder Mr. Barrett. "If I&#xD;
left the house and place alone, it would be&#xD;
desolated and burned in less than a week.&#xD;
But while I am here, and profess to be strictly&#xD;
neutral, they will touch nothing of mine.&#xD;
They have not meddled with my negroes so&#xD;
Sar, and I do not believe they ever will!"&#xD;
"If they don't, your niggers will hear all&#xD;
too soon that they will get their freedom, and,&#xD;
be paid for work, if they go to the Yankees.&#xD;
And then you know you can't keep them !"&#xD;
"Well, it may be so, my son-it may be&#xD;
so. if I thought it would, I would send all&#xD;
the valuable hands further South right&#xD;
away!"&#xD;
"I would, father, if I were in your place.&#xD;
But Ill tell you more in the morning, for I&#xD;
mean to hide away with you for two or three,&#xD;
&#xD;
E SADDLE.                             7&#xD;
days to rest myself. I did think of returning&#xD;
to-night, but I have a three-days' leave from&#xD;
camp, and I think I'll stay it out. My horse&#xD;
stands saddled and bridled in the stable. I&#xD;
think I'll take off his trappings and hide&#xD;
them, and then turn him out to forage in the&#xD;
back lot, where he'll not be noticed. Atter&#xD;
that I turn him in, for I am about half-worn&#xD;
out !"&#xD;
Very well, my boy. We will take good&#xD;
care of you. You had better take the little&#xD;
room inside of your sister's bedroom, for no&#xD;
Yankee officer would be so ungallant as to&#xD;
go through her room to search for you--at&#xD;
least such Yankees as I have met so far;&#xD;
would not!"&#xD;
"Very well, father. I'll put out my horse,&#xD;
and then retire !"&#xD;
"Why don't you let me call one of the nig-&#xD;
gers to do it for you ?"&#xD;
"Because, father, the infernal blacks are so&#xD;
careless that I dare not trust them with the&#xD;
knowledge that I am here. It must be kept&#xD;
from them, especially from the common&#xD;
hands! They are always gabbing to stran-&#xD;
gers!&#xD;
"Well, I suppose it will be best. I wish&#xD;
the infernal war was over. I was clearing a&#xD;
good five thousand a year before it broke out,&#xD;
and now I can't pay expenses. And there's&#xD;
Doctor Glover, my first cousin, down at Cedar,&#xD;
Point, almost ruined by it. Seventy of his&#xD;
niggers have gone into Norfolk to the Yan-&#xD;
kees ; and his pretty daughter Annie, that you&#xD;
used to think so much of, has actually had to&#xD;
do the housework for her father. 'I he poor&#xD;
old man is near crazy with grief at his&#xD;
losses 1'&#xD;
"No wonder. We used to take such a&#xD;
pride in his place. But he half deserves it ;&#xD;
for I remember, if you don't, that lie voted&#xD;
against secession when the Old Dominion&#xD;
went out of the Union."&#xD;
"So would I have done then, it it hadn't&#xD;
been for you military hot-heads.. I told you&#xD;
then that the war would desolate our State&#xD;
and ruin us all ; but you laughed at me, and&#xD;
said that the Yankees would never, ight or&#xD;
dare to cross Mason and Dixon's line. But&#xD;
you see they have. And we are getting&#xD;
weaker every day ; our money isn't worth&#xD;
anything, provisions are getting scarce, and&#xD;
there is no end to their money or to the men&#xD;
they can call into the field !"&#xD;
"Just wait till England and France recog-&#xD;
nize us, father. Then they will put in an&#xD;
armed interference, and the poor Yanks will&#xD;
be nowhere !"&#xD;
"Yes, when England and France do reco-&#xD;
nize us. But neithb you nor I, my son, will&#xD;
live to see that day. But go and put out&#xD;
your horse, for I see you are tired and need&#xD;
rest!'&#xD;

CHAPTER     IV,&#xD;
The night passed away without any cause&#xD;
of disLurbance or alarm to the Federal scouts&#xD;
in their well-concealed bivouac. An hour or&#xD;
two before daylight, the Sergeant in command&#xD;
quietly aroused his men and bade them feed&#xD;
their horses and get their own breakfasts, so&#xD;
as Lo ho ready for a start at the very dawn of&#xD;
day.&#xD;
Quickly the ration of oats was given to&#xD;
each horse in his nose-bag, and then the men&#xD;
ha ened to cook their own coffee and meat.&#xD;
They had enjoyed something which they sel-&#xD;
dora got-an uninterrupted night's rest ; and&#xD;
now woke with good appetites for another&#xD;
t hin; which they did not always have-a hot&#xD;
 and a plentiful breakfast.&#xD;
Thn broiling of fowls and meat before the&#xD;
iLrL' and hot lire, and the boiling of the cof-&#xD;
fe-ration did not take them a great while,&#xD;
nr did their meal occupy quite as much&#xD;
time as a gourmand would waste over a din-&#xD;
ncr at Deinonico's. In less than half an&#xD;
her, the "nmatutinal meal" was properly at&#xD;
tended to, and then the horses were biidled&#xD;
and saddle-girths tightened, ready for a start.&#xD;
A canteen of hot coffee and a ration of meat&#xD;
and riead were prepared for the two men who&#xD;
stool guard on the outpost; and then the&#xD;
party mounted and rode quietly out to the&#xD;
rot, leading out the horses of the two men&#xD;
staieOned there.&#xD;
It re the party halted while the guards ate&#xD;
th a breakiast and answered the questions&#xD;
wlieh Cliflord had to ask. The man who&#xD;
h ode by on the previous evening had not&#xD;
r"t.rned, nor had anyone else gone by.&#xD;
Citl'ord carefully examined the tracks&#xD;
tea e by the horse of the man who had pass-&#xD;
ci m the night.&#xD;
 te can easily be followed," he said, after&#xD;
h1' had looked along the track for a few rods.&#xD;
'T'he horse had large feet and Was only shod&#xD;
i'he fore-feet !" he added.&#xD;
Il° then called the two young men whom&#xD;
w e  iiily described in the first chapter-&#xD;
Uruce anA Dolan-to hi:- side, and said .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Boys, I am going to send you on detached&#xD;
and important duty. You arc well fitted for&#xD;
it ; for you, Bruce, have the impetuosity of a&#xD;
whirlwind, while Dolan is as cold as marble&#xD;
and all as firm. I want you to follow the&#xD;
tracks of the horseman who passed la;st night&#xD;
-you can see them very plainly. If it is&#xD;
possible to overtake him outside of the Rebel&#xD;
lines, po it, and carry hin to our head-quar-&#xD;
ters. Lake him dead or alive, if you can do&#xD;
it without too great risk to yourselves. I ex-&#xD;
pect, if nothing happens to us, to reach camp&#xD;
with the rest of the boys by sunset or a little&#xD;
after. I hope to find you there., I know you&#xD;
well enough to feel assured that I shall not&#xD;
hear of you retreating from less than a half-&#xD;
dozen Rebs, and that they will never carry&#xD;
you to Richmond as prisoners while you have&#xD;
a cartridge left, or an arm strong enough to&#xD;
raise a sabre ! Good-bye, and God bless you!."&#xD;
"Thanks I" cried both of the young men&#xD;
as they vaulted into their saddles. "We&#xD;
will deserve your good opinion, Sergeant.&#xD;
The name of the Rides shall never suffer&#xD;
through our misconduct !"&#xD;
Ant then, with their eyes on the well-&#xD;
defined track and their spurs to their horses'&#xD;
hinks, they bounded out of sight in a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Now, men, look to your arms ; by twos&#xD;
to, the right-march! Within twenty min-&#xD;
utes we shall see the pickets at Blackwater&#xD;
Bridge. One volley will scatter them as we&#xD;
dash for the Zuni Road ; and if they're not&#xD;
fools enough to follow us, well have little to&#xD;
do but to keep an easy pace. with our horses&#xD;
until we take a look at Zuni. Thbre, we&#xD;
inay have some work if they get any haint&#xD;
from signals, as they have done before, that&#xD;
we are coming ! Keep your horses in hand,&#xD;
and be ready for a rush-we've got to go by&#xD;
the bridge-pickets in a hurry, for we'll be in&#xD;
range of their ritle-pits for near two hundred&#xD;
yards! Steady now, and look sharp I"&#xD;
Without a word, hooking up their sabres so&#xD;
that their clanging could not be heard, with&#xD;
unslung carbines in their right hands, the&#xD;
gallant scouts now moved on in a compact&#xD;
cohimn of twos ; the Sergeant, as usual with&#xD;
him, taking the advance.&#xD;
The morning was clear, and a gentle breeze&#xD;
stirred the leafy branches on either side of&#xD;
them, and gave fresh vigor both to man and&#xD;
beast. For a mile and a half they rode on in&#xD;
silence, keeping the direct road toward Black-&#xD;
water Bridge. Then they descended into a&#xD;
small ravine, through which ran a clear&#xD;
stream of water not more; than six or eight&#xD;
inches in depth. Beyond this stream the&#xD;
road led abruptly over a steep bluff, the&#xD;
banks of which on either side of the road&#xD;
were too steep to be passable for man or&#xD;
Least.&#xD;

"I feel as if we'd have that fellow !" said&#xD;
Bruce, as he and Dolan took a seat near&#xD;
where their horses were fastened, in a spot&#xD;
where, concealed by some bushes, they could&#xD;
look down the road for three or four hundred&#xD;
yards. "He must have been concealed some-&#xD;
where -about the house when we were there.&#xD;
And he will not wish the chance of a force.&#xD;

supposes we have reported. He may find the&#xD;

"I hope so, both for our own sakes and&#xD;
Clifford's, too ; for the Sergeant takes a pride&#xD;
in everything smart w edo. Hark ! I thought&#xD;
1 heard the sound of wheels'!"&#xD;
And Dolan, the speaker, laid his ear to the&#xD;
ground to listen.&#xD;
"Yes ! To horse, my boys !" he said in a&#xD;
moment after. "Some one is coming up the&#xD;
1oad in a wagon !"&#xD;
Both of' the scouts. in an instant more were&#xD;
in their saddles, and eagerly watching the&#xD;
turn in the road where they would first see&#xD;
who and what was coming.&#xD;
It was scarce a minute before they saw&#xD;
a horse, attached to a light wagon, coming&#xD;
rapidly up the road.&#xD;
A man in a gray uniform was driving the&#xD;
horse, and a female was on the seat by his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"Our game, by the great Original Jew&#xD;
of Chatham street !" said Bruce, in a gleeful&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
" What the devil has lie got a woman with&#xD;
him for t" asked Dolan.&#xD;
"May be lie thinks lie can get off easier&#xD;
with one in tow.  She may go to the devil;&#xD;
but he has got to 'o to Suffolk, and that is the&#xD;
next place to old kick's quarters&#xD;
But a few seconds elapsed before the wagon&#xD;
was close to the spot where the cavalrymen&#xD;
were in waiting, and then together they&#xD;
spurred their steeds into the road.&#xD;
Major Barrett saw his peril, and strove-to&#xD;
lash his horse into a run.&#xD;
But Dolan seized the horse by the bits, and&#xD;
checking his own horse by a, word, stopped&#xD;
it so suddenly that it reared back upon its&#xD;
haunches. While Bruce, with his carbine&#xD;
leveled at the Major's head, gave him his&#xD;
choice of death or surrender, politely intimt-&#xD;
ing that it was a matter of no difference&#xD;
to him which the Major preferred, only the&#xD;
choice must be made at once.&#xD;
Of course, the Major did iot wish to die&#xD;
just then, and he surrendered ; only remark-&#xD;
ing, that it was devilish hard for a commis-&#xD;
sioted officer and a gentleman to have to sur-&#xD;
render to a common private.&#xD;
Bruce now asked the Major what he wish-&#xD;
ed to have done with the lady by his side,&#xD;

They hid not gone far before a bright light&#xD;
was seen in their rear, and the Sergeant see-&#xD;

"You must remember, boys, that if we are&#xD;

you to be careful, and it has occurred acci-&#xD;

said Clifford.&#xD;

rode meirilly on, all pleased with the result&#xD;
of the expedition, except poor George, whose&#xD;
heart throbbed sadly as he thought of poor&#xD;

CH APTER XXIX.&#xD;
Roger A. Pryor never was considered the&#xD;
ha lsomest man in the Iouse, when he was&#xD;
a imimber of Congress.. Nor did he look&#xD;
vi iferocious whehi lie refused to meet Mr.&#xD;
Pot ter with bowie-knives, to brighten his&#xD;
t't'ihedt honor. And I have seen handsom-&#xD;
or men in the field titan lie looked to me one&#xD;
iday, when lie was skedaddling away from&#xD;
our Rites in Virginia, his lank form cased in&#xD;
a suit of rusty gray, his long hair floating&#xD;
out like singed flax on the wind, and the rim&#xD;
of a very Greeley-like hat flopping about&#xD;
his long ears, his heels pressed vigorously&#xD;
to the flanks of a horse that looked to be&#xD;
of far more intrinsic worth than its rider.&#xD;
But he looked, and doubtless felt, very&#xD;
&#xD;
comfortable in his quarters near Ivor, just&#xD;
across the Blackwater, when Major 3arrett&#xD;
called on him to request permission to get&#xD;
up an expedition of a foraging and maraud-&#xD;
ing nature.&#xD;
For he had a large mint-julep in his hand&#xD;
-a barrel of apple-jack set on end served&#xD;
him for a table, on which a lunch was spread,&#xD;
and a small keg of the same article consti-&#xD;
tuted his seat.&#xD;
"What is new on the tapis, Major?" he&#xD;
asked, in his boyish voice, as he took a bite&#xD;
at a sandwich and then moistened it with a&#xD;
sip of julep.&#xD;
"Nothing new around here, General," re-&#xD;
plied the Major, blandly. taking the seat on&#xD;
another liquor-keg to which he was motioned&#xD;
by the General. "But I came to ask permis-&#xD;
sion to get up something,new !"&#xD;
"Well, what is it, Major? A plan to stir&#xD;
up our Yankee neighbors ?"&#xD;
"Yes, General. I should like to take a&#xD;
battalion of my regiment and a battery, and&#xD;
go down toward the vicinity of Suffolk, to&#xD;
see if I can't ambush a few of the infernal&#xD;
vandals, to pay up for the couple of weeks,&#xD;
involuntary board which they gave me&#xD;
"Is not such a force as you request too&#xD;
small to go so near their lines as you pro-&#xD;
pose. They come out scouting with a full&#xD;
regiment very often !"&#xD;
"I know it, General ; but I ask no greater&#xD;
force than my rank entitles me to command,&#xD;
for I wish to go in command of this expe-&#xD;
dition. I think that, with my knowledge of&#xD;
the country, I can do something handsome&#xD;
for the cause, and give some of the Northern&#xD;
mudsills a sound drubbing !"&#xD;
"I admire your zeal and ambition, Major,&#xD;
and shall not do anything, I assure you, to&#xD;
lessen it, but rather forward your wishes, so&#xD;
far as I can. You can take Done's Light&#xD;
Battery with you, and I will detail another&#xD;
battalion from' Claiborne's Georia regiment&#xD;
of horse. Its Major is your junior, and you&#xD;
will be in command then of quite a respecta-&#xD;
ble force !"&#xD;
"A thousand thanks, General. I will do&#xD;
something with it that will please you !"&#xD;
"I do not doubt it, Major. When will you&#xD;
start ?"&#xD;
" Early t9-morrow morning, Sir, without&#xD;

"Yes, Sergeant, in the course of an houror&#xD;
two, to return early to-morrow. Will you not&#xD;
take a trip with me, and receive the intro-&#xD;
dtuction that I promised you ?"&#xD;
"I will, if I can get leave from my Colonel.&#xD;
I can ride up to camp and be hack in thirty&#xD;
or forty minutes. If I do not return within&#xD;
that time, you will know that circumstances&#xD;
oblige me to decline your kind invitation."&#xD;
"'Very well; I shall expect you, and I hope&#xD;

"It will not take me an hour ii the Colonel&#xD;

geant, as he leaped into the saddle and rode&#xD;
ohr up the street at full speed.&#xD;
The Captain of the gunboat now went,&#xD;
on board his vessel to oroer steam to be got&#xD;
up, and make the necessary prep rations for&#xD;
his trip.&#xD;
He did not have to wait over his time for&#xD;
the appearance of the Sergeant :for, in less&#xD;
than the fo ty minutes named, thm latter rode&#xD;
down to the whuri; with another man in con-&#xD;
pany to tike his horse back, and waved a sig-&#xD;
nal for a boat.&#xD;
" All risht, Captain," said lie, as lie stepped&#xD;
on board the gunboat. 'And if we see any&#xD;
birds worth the shooting, i've brought along&#xD;
a nice double-barreled sun, that I took from&#xD;
a sneaking North Carolina guerrilla, not long&#xD;
ago. It is of English make, and looks as if it&#xD;
would throw sho't well."&#xD;
"We may see some ducks on the river,"&#xD;
said the Captain, with a smile. 'And pos-&#xD;
sibly we may spy some gray geese on land-&#xD;
if we do, my Iarrott thirties may talk to&#xD;
them rather saucily. I always load with&#xD;

would have unloaded it before lie was captur-&#xD;

generally are."&#xD;
"lie probably would have done so, had he&#xD;

"A sedative? Do your men administer&#xD;

LIFE IN TH&#xD;
"I'll keep an eye on them myself. Orderly,&#xD;
take my saddle off my bay horse, and put it&#xD;
on my gray. He is fresh and must take the&#xD;
next turn."&#xD;
The Orderly obeyed, and led up a magnifi-&#xD;
cent ray stallion of powerful build, whose&#xD;
clean limbs, small ears, and lithe frame be-&#xD;
tokened the purity of his blood, upon which&#xD;
he placed the trappings which he took from&#xD;
the tired bay.&#xD;
Sergeant ~Clifford, who stood near where&#xD;
the horses were, and close by Captain Rad-&#xD;
ford, whispered to him:&#xD;
"I am about to make a bold trial for escape.&#xD;
If I get clear, keep up a good heart, for I will&#xD;
rescue you, before you reach a Rebel prison.&#xD;
Say nothing, but keep cool, and you'll soon&#xD;
see a bit of horsemanship which will rather&#xD;
astonish these graybacked bunglers."&#xD;
"What the devil arc ydu two Yanks whis-&#xD;
pering there about?" cried the Major, an-&#xD;
grily. "Stand apart, or I'll have you tied to&#xD;
two trees, back to back t"&#xD;
Clifford stepped away quickly, as if startled&#xD;
at the rebuke, and his stride carried him&#xD;
within a few feet of the gray horse, which&#xD;
the orderly had just finished saddling and&#xD;
bridling.&#xD;
The next instant, with an astonishing&#xD;
bound, lie leaped into the saddle, and driving&#xD;
the spurs which were permanently fixed into&#xD;
the heels of his cavalry-boots, into the flanks&#xD;
of the horse, lie gave a yell, which nothing but&#xD;
a Camanche brave could have approached,&#xD;
and the horse frightened, gave a, wild leap&#xD;
directly over the Major, who unfortunately&#xD;
for him stood in the way, felling him sense-&#xD;
less to the ground, and dashed off down the&#xD;
road with a speed which defied pursuit.&#xD;
A few scattering shots were fired after the&#xD;
daring fugitive; and a dozen of the best&#xD;
mounted men rode off in pursuit ; but they&#xD;
might as well have chased a feather on the&#xD;
breath of a whirlwind. He was free, and,&#xD;
knowing the country as he did, there was&#xD;
little danger of his recapture.&#xD;
It was some minutes before the Major re-&#xD;
covered his senses sufficiently to know (is-&#xD;
tinctly what had occurred.&#xD;
When he did, his rage was terrible; for he&#xD;
was suffering the pain of several broken ribs,&#xD;
inflicted by the hoofs of his horse as it had&#xD;
gone over him, besides the thought of losing&#xD;
a horse valued as one of the fastest and best&#xD;
in the Southern Army, for which he had&#xD;
been offered very large sums, but had refused,&#xD;
preferring to keep so good a horse for his own&#xD;
special use. For well he knew there were,&#xD;
and might for him, be times, when life itself&#xD;
depended upon the speed of a horse.&#xD;
His curses were neither few nor select, and&#xD;
he instantly ordered every prisoner to be&#xD;
bound hand and foot. And he sent a party&#xD;
&#xD;
80&#xD;
&#xD;
of men out to seize carts to carry them in.&#xD;
after that ; not daring to trust them on horse.&#xD;
back, even with his own men.&#xD;
And well knowing that Clifford would&#xD;
speedily carry the news of his whereabouts&#xD;
to the nearest Federal forces,'he soon after&#xD;
broke up his bivouac ; and, tired as his men&#xD;
and horses were, moved on in the gloom of&#xD;
the night, knowing well that there would be&#xD;
no safety for him on that side of the Black.&#xD;
water.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
The instant that the Commanding-General&#xD;
at Suffolk received information of the cap-&#xD;
ture of Captain Radford and his party, he&#xD;
ordered out a force after the Rebels. The&#xD;
Mounted Rifles were already in the saddle,&#xD;
their commander having been instructed to&#xD;
proceed with his regiment to see what was&#xD;
going on below, when the guns of the gun-&#xD;
boat and battery were first heard. He, there-&#xD;
fore, was ready to dash forward at once when&#xD;
the information brought by the gunboat ar-&#xD;
rived, and having been permitted to see the&#xD;
brief note in the memorandum-book of his&#xD;
scounting-seargeant, he comprehended in a&#xD;
moment the route which the Rebels must&#xD;
take to get back to the Blackwater.&#xD;
He therefore, asked, and received, permis-&#xD;
sion to move on as fast as he could, without&#xD;
waiting for the artillery and infantry force&#xD;
that was ordered out ; being in hopes of over-&#xD;
taking the enemy and holding him engaged&#xD;
until more force could come up, if lie should&#xD;
find him too strong for his own regiment to&#xD;
handle.&#xD;
Therefore, while the shallow waters of the&#xD;
Nansemond were yet muddy with the arrival&#xD;
of the steamer, he, with his well mounted&#xD;
regiment, was speeding swiftly over the draw-&#xD;
bridge and on through the region of sand&#xD;
and pine beyond it, on the way to intercept&#xD;
the enemy, if possible, before he could reach&#xD;
his fortified lines across the meanest swamp.&#xD;
line, liver-colored river that ever was known&#xD;
in Virginia.&#xD;
At as much speed as could be kept up with-&#xD;
out rendering the horses unfit for service, the&#xD;
regiment moved forward, the usual precau-&#xD;
tions of strong advance and rearguards be-&#xD;
ing thrown out. Night came on, but they&#xD;
did not halt. Forward, no sound but the&#xD;
jingling of scabbards and the heavy breath-&#xD;
ing of the horses-forward in a column of&#xD;
fours, over roads already well known to them&#xD;
all, passing here and there a deserted house&#xD;
or some miserable plantation that had been&#xD;
sacked in turn, alike by Rebel ant Federal-&#xD;
ist, through a country in which nothing was&#xD;
left worth fighting for, apparently.&#xD;
It was about two hours after sunset, per-&#xD;
haps even more, when the advance-guard&#xD;

"Where did they keep their artillery on if they have to haul the guns live miles&#xD;

&#xD;
have to keep their whips going all the time&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Very well- Sir. There is a house close&#xD;
ahead owned by a good friend to the Confed-&#xD;
eracy. I hate to take his horses ; but he has&#xD;
some good ones, and my necessity knows no&#xD;
law, and must be any excuse. If tine Yankees&#xD;
follow us up, when we've whipped them&#xD;
I'll return him two horses for each one that I&#xD;
take !"&#xD;
And the Major resumed his march, sending&#xD;
his Adjutant on again, to look for a defensible&#xD;
position.&#xD;
Upon arriving at the 'plantation which&#xD;
they were then in sight of the Major seized&#xD;
four fresh horses for tle carriage, and took&#xD;
the tired horses from it. After having the&#xD;
fresh horses put to the carriage, he caused&#xD;
the Captain to be taken from the cart where&#xD;
he had been thrown unceremoniously with&#xD;
his men, and had him  laced in the carriage&#xD;
with Doctor Glv -er and his family.&#xD;
Then selecting a faithful non-commissioned&#xD;
officer and a strong guard of the best-mounted&#xD;
macn, he ordered them to hurry forward with&#xD;
the prisoiers to the Rebel camp across the&#xD;
Blackwater, and it they heard cannonading&#xD;
in the rear, to report to the General that he&#xD;
was attacked by superior forces, and needed&#xD;
mounted re-cniorceneents as soon as they&#xD;
could get to him.&#xD;
"I suppose you will like the change in&#xD;
your mode of conveyance, and especially&#xD;
our company, Sir !" said Barrett to Captain&#xD;
Radford. "Make the most of it, for your en-&#xD;
joyment of it will be brief."&#xD;
The naval officer made no reply : the das-&#xD;
tardly treatment he had already received&#xD;
from the iRebel Major's hands had so angered&#xD;
him that ie felt no inclination to bandy&#xD;
words with such a brute.&#xD;
Therefore the carriage rolled off without&#xD;
the occupants either looking at or speaking&#xD;
to the uniformed villain who had them in&#xD;
power for the time.&#xD;
But when once they were beyond his hear-&#xD;
ing, the Glovers hastened first to cut the fast-&#xD;
enings which bound the Captain's hands and&#xD;
legs, and then to express their indignation at&#xD;
the unmanly treatment which they had re-&#xD;
ceived.&#xD;
"It is only lent !" said the Captain, quietly.&#xD;
"My time will comie- yet, and you may rest'&#xD;
msured that Major Barrett will he repaid&#xD;
with interest for his abuse. If I cannot&#xD;
scupe, they must soon exchange me, and I&#xD;
will never rest after I am free until I have&#xD;
founi and punishei him I"&#xD;
 But what is to become of us ?" sighed&#xD;
Annie. "T'I'here is no exchange for us ; and&#xD;
I dread to think what they may do with our&#xD;
dear father.  Our cousin has dared to say&#xD;
that they will hang him for treason I'&#xD;
&#xD;
"I&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hope they will not be so errel as to add&#xD;
to his or your sufferings. And I pray you&#xD;
to keep up a bold heart. The Sergeant that&#xD;
escaped will soon reach the Federal lines,&#xD;
and his information will bring a strong force&#xD;
out after the Rebels, and we may yet be res-&#xD;
cued !"&#xD;
"Oh, I hope and pray that it may be so.&#xD;
It is terrible to be in the power of a con-&#xD;
scienceless and unscrupulous man!" said&#xD;
Annie.&#xD;
" Hark ! there is firing in our rear !" cried&#xD;
the Captain, joyfully. "Our friends are&#xD;
near. Oh that I were free and armed now, or&#xD;
that we were yet with the main body instead&#xD;
of being away from them !"&#xD;
"Whip up your horses and drive on fast-&#xD;
er !" cried the Sergeant of. the guard to the&#xD;
driver of the carriage. "lurry up, you&#xD;
black imp, or Ill give you an inch of my&#xD;
sabre by way of a spur !"&#xD;
And on dashed the carriage at a rapid rate,&#xD;
away from the heavy lire now heard in their&#xD;
rear.&#xD;
-    CIIAPTEIt\XXXVII.&#xD;
The column under command of Major&#xD;
Barrett proceeded about four miles from the&#xD;
place where the carriage had left it, and then&#xD;
caine to a halt at a spot which tie Adjutant&#xD;
had selected as a very defensilde position. A&#xD;
narrow but deep stream, bordered on either&#xD;
side by a swamp, crossed the road, being&#xD;
bridged by a log causeway through the&#xD;
swamp, and the single span over the stream&#xD;
being covered with fifteen or twenty planks.&#xD;
As the swamp was inpassable for some&#xD;
distance above and below the road, the Major&#xD;
agreed with his subordinate that their rear&#xD;
was well guarded, when the planks were&#xD;
thrown off the bridge so as to prevent cav-&#xD;
alr from crossing.&#xD;
Therefore, planting a couple of guns so as&#xD;
to sweep the road leading to the bridge, the&#xD;
Major halted his commandl in an open field&#xD;
just beyond it, and ordered the mcn to feed&#xD;
their horses and to refresh themselves. A&#xD;
slight guard was thrown out in front, more&#xD;
as a matter of form than necessity, for no&#xD;
enemy was to beexpfted coming from that&#xD;
direction, when theirown lines were within&#xD;
a few miles.&#xD;
A single sentinel kept a lookout to the&#xD;
rear, though the cannoneers were directed to&#xD;
remain near their guns while they ate and&#xD;
drank, so as to be ready for instant serv-&#xD;
ice.&#xD;
Fires were lighted for the preparation ot&#xD;
food, the forage-carts drawn up, and soon the&#xD;
whole command was busy in refreshing&#xD;
themselves and their weary animals.&#xD;
But they were not destined to.- remain long&#xD;
undisturbed- But few had got a meal cnok-&#xD;

Ritles did act cumumand hits position in a Gloiver family.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finding that this was the case, he at once&#xD;
applied to his commander for, permission to&#xD;
take eighteen or twenty men and press for- t&#xD;
ward to try and overtake the unfortunate&#xD;
captives.&#xD;
'his permission was readily granted, for&#xD;
services such is his had been were not suchI&#xD;
as his ever-generous commander would un-&#xD;
dervalue or overlook; and in a few minutes&#xD;
he was moving at a rapid rate along the road&#xD;
which had been passed over by the carriage.1&#xD;
The lat words of his commander were ae&#xD;
caution not to rashlry un into the jaws of' the&#xD;
enemy ; and if hoe foud that the occupants of1&#xD;
the carriage had really been taken beyondI&#xD;
the Rebel lines, to return and trust to him for&#xD;
negotiations, which, with tie crowd of pris-j&#xD;
oners he had on his hands, would effect their&#xD;
release.&#xD;
He remembered this when, after riding as&#xD;
fast as he darel, lie reached the vicinity of&#xD;
the Blackwater, just in time to see the car-&#xD;
riage disappearing amid the ranks of a large&#xD;
body of troops'which were crossing the river&#xD;
to come to the aid of Major Barrett.&#xD;
He only waited long enough to see that the&#xD;
force which was crossmig was numerically&#xD;
far too great to render it wise for the Rifles to&#xD;
await their attack, encumbered as they were&#xD;
with prisoners ; thei hLe hurried' back to let&#xD;
his Colonel know of the new danger which&#xD;
menaced them.&#xD;
He found on his arrival at the late battle-&#xD;
ground, that the bridge had been repaired,&#xD;
the prisoners moust-ered and mounted, and&#xD;
everything made   ready for falling back&#xD;
toward Butlflk.&#xD;
His information caused the Colonel to move&#xD;
on with his column at once, leaving a strong&#xD;
rearguard to again destroy the bridge, and&#xD;
place other oht ructions in the way of the&#xD;
pursuing enemy.&#xD;
This was doino barely in time to check them&#xD;
before the Federal force was out of shelling-&#xD;
distance; for the Rebels, with a heavy force&#xD;
of cavalry nid artillery, reached the demol-&#xD;
iahed bridge, while the rearguard of the&#xD;
titles were yet ito sight.&#xD;
But the (olonel conmmnanding the Federal&#xD;
forces knew that lie was safe, for it would&#xD;
take the enemy a considerable time to gather&#xD;
material to iebuild the bridge; and he well&#xD;
knew also that a heavy force was on the way&#xD;
from Suffolk to aid him, and that the delay&#xD;
of the enemy would probably give him time&#xD;
to reach the ieiinity of that force.&#xD;
Had he nt been so encumbered with pris-&#xD;
oners and wagons, he would have remained at&#xD;
the bridge and foaghit the Rebels. But there&#xD;
was very liulet aunnmmmition left for the use of&#xD;
the Rebel bauery which he lad captured; and&#xD;
brave as Lie was almost to rashness, he would&#xD;
not risk time 1.. ui is tysoners by staying,&#xD;
&#xD;
when he could fall back upon a sure support,&#xD;
which would fearfully punish the Rebels if&#xD;
they persisted in following him up.&#xD;
And his judgment proved good, for when&#xD;
some hours after he met the Union force of&#xD;
artillery and infantry, the pursuing enemy&#xD;
had just come in sight of his rearguard.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
Finding the Union force too powerful to&#xD;
be attacked when united, the Rebel pursuers&#xD;
of the victorious Mounted Rifles fell back,&#xD;
with all possible speed toward their lines,&#xD;
their mounted men being able to out-travel&#xD;
the infantry who were ready and anxious to&#xD;
engage them. Nothing therefore was left but&#xD;
for our forces to fall back to outl'olk, the ob-&#xD;
ject of the expedition having been completely&#xD;
and gallantly eflcted by the cavalry regi-&#xD;
meat alone, the recapttire of Captain Rad-&#xD;
ford and his friends being the only thing&#xD;
which lacked complete success.&#xD;
A day or two after the return of the troops,&#xD;
Bruce and Dolan entered the tent of Ser-&#xD;
geant Clifford.&#xD;
"Well, boys, what is, up? I see you've got&#xD;
something important in your minds by your&#xD;
looks !" said the Sergeant.&#xD;
"You'd like to get your friends, Captain .&#xD;
Radford and the family of )oetor Glover,&#xD;
out of Rebel hands, would you not ?" said&#xD;
Bruce.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed ; I'd give all of my pay and&#xD;
two fingers off my left hand to accomplish&#xD;
such a tilng I" said Clifford, eagerly.&#xD;
"Well, Dolan and me have been thinking&#xD;
over the matter and trying to plan how that&#xD;
could be done, and something else which we&#xD;
have set our minds upon. We've found out .&#xD;
that old Barrett is living near the Rebel&#xD;
camp on the other side of the Blackwater,&#xD;
and that he has got Elise and her mother&#xD;
back from Dashiell !"&#xD;
"how did you learn that ?"&#xD;
"From some of the prisoners in Major&#xD;
Barrett's command. And we've determined,&#xD;
if allowed, to try it ; to run all risks to free&#xD;
those poor women once more, and with a&#xD;
little more help we may be able to get the&#xD;
rest away at the same time"&#xD;
"Ike idea is good; but to succeed looks as&#xD;
near impossibility as can be !"&#xD;
"I ve heard you say before now that there&#xD;
was no such thing as an impossibility ! said&#xD;
Dolan, in his usual quiet way.&#xD;
"I acknowledge   that," said  Clifford.&#xD;
"Since you have been thinking over this mat-&#xD;
ter, what plan have you formed ?"&#xD;
"Why, we find we can buy up some of&#xD;
the Rebel uniforms; for they, poor devils, will&#xD;
sell anything they have got for rum of&#xD;
tobacco !"&#xD;
"Well, what thenY"&#xD;

came, indeed, to make a propition which,&#xD;
if acceded to, would at least have given you&#xD;
the liberty of residing without restraint in&#xD;

"They are enough to justify my silence ;&#xD;
but I will not hold anger against one so near-&#xD;
ly related to me as you are by my marriage&#xD;
with your sister. The General wil permit you&#xD;
to reside with me unguarded, upon condition&#xD;
of your taking the oath of allegiance to the&#xD;
Confederate States of America, and upon your&#xD;
proving yourself loyal to the said Confed-&#xD;
eracy; he will give you freedom to go any-&#xD;

"Did the General send such a message to&#xD;
me by youY"&#xD;
mUponin representations of your rela-&#xD;
tionship, and the interest I felt in you, he&#xD;
did so."&#xD;
Well, you can take my answer back to&#xD;
him. But, by the way, perhaps he made&#xD;
some threat of doing something else if I re-&#xD;
fused to take the oath you mention. Do not&#xD;
do your errand by halves."&#xD;

"I leave my poor girls to the care of Al-&#xD;

will remain to wither and blast my murder-&#xD;

just Providence will fall upon the heads of'&#xD;
my persecutors. No fear dwells in my breast,&#xD;

that, Sir. And I know the noble girls did&#xD;
not. They know me and my feelings too&#xD;

the sacrifice of principle. You need not re-&#xD;

you are master of could not change my de-&#xD;

"Very well, Doctor ; it is painful, but I&#xD;
must tell the General that you refuse his offer,&#xD;
and the consequences will be upon your own&#xD;
head. Farewell l"&#xD;
"Farewell, Sir. You need not annoy me&#xD;
by coming here again," said the Doctor, turn-&#xD;
ing his back upon his departing visitor.&#xD;
"What do you think of that, Captain ?"&#xD;
asked the Doctor, when they were lell once&#xD;

"I think, Sir, that your decision is as noble&#xD;
as your own more than Roman soul. And&#xD;
that a just God will not permit your enemies&#xD;
to triumph in your death. I shall endeavor&#xD;
to plan our mutual escape, if it is a possible&#xD;

Where what was known as the "old Black-&#xD;
water Bridge" stood, before it was burned&#xD;
down when the Rebels evacuated Norfolk,&#xD;
there was at the time of which we write a&#xD;
strong picket-guard posted near some earth-&#xD;
works and rifle-pits, a short distance in ad-&#xD;
vance of the main encampment of the Rebel&#xD;
force. These works and the guard were on&#xD;
the western side of the river, which was now&#xD;
unbridged, except when they wished to cross&#xD;
troops, when their floating or swinging&#xD;
bridh'e, as it was termed, was drawn athwart&#xD;
the deep but narrow stream.   The Rebels&#xD;
held this river as their line, and had fortified&#xD;
every feasible place where it could be cross-&#xD;
ed, so as to retard the advance of our forces&#xD;
toward Petersburg, only a good day's march&#xD;
distant.&#xD;
