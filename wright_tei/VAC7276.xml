               <p>WARM and loving was the sun's bright glance, as it beamed through the aperture
                  which served for a window, in the miserable hovel old Paul Brown called his home.
                  In strange contrast with those glad, joyous beams, dancing so merrily in through
                  every crevice, was this wretched abode of penury and want. Hunger, cold, and
                  consuming disease, held undisputed sway within the comfortless walls. Nought was
                  there to stay the hand of the destroyer, as he stealthily crept toward the old
                  man's couch. <emph>Couch,</emph> did I say? If a wisp of straw, scattered
                  sparingly over a few rough boards, and covered with such rags as had been gleaned
                  from the streets and by-ways, with only a larger bunch<pb n="2-3"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000006"/> of them for a pillow, could be dignified by such a
                  name, then was Paul Brown's resting-place a couch; for thus had his aged limbs,
                  feeble and worn with care and sorrow, found their only repose. None knew how long
                  he had been an occupant of the hitherto deserted hut, nor whence he came. His very
                  existence would have been unnoticed, save that each morning a ragged, dirty,
                  half-famished looking boy knocked gently at many of the doors in the village near
                  by, and in plaintive tones asked for "somethin' for gran'ther to eat." Thus had
                  they lived for many a weary month—the old man and boy; and thus, perhaps, they
                  might have lived on still as many more, had not the feeble flickering of life's
                  lamp given warning, that soon all sorrow and want would find an eternal rest.</p>
               <p>Still, the bright sun, unmindful of all save its own life-giving mission, bathed
                  those palsied limbs in its radiant warmth, as lovingly as a few moments later it
                  kissed the rosy mouth, and sparkled in the golden curls of the rich squire's
                  youngest treasure.</p>
               <p>The old man roused from his deep sleep at the genial touch, and, half awaking,
                  thought some angel's wing had fanned his brow, so sweet had been his sleeping
                  fancies. But, alas! in dreams only can suffering want like his find forgetfulness.
                  One glance at the uncovered rafters above, the bare walls around, untouched save
                  by the hand of time, and his illusion vanished. Feebly raising his head, supported
                  by a skeleton hand, he looked anxiously toward the opposite corner, and in tones
                  of piteous weakness cried,</p>
               <p>"Lonny, Lonny boy, why don't you wake up? I'm a'most froze, and starved too."</p>
               <p>What had before seemed but a bundle of rags, stowed carelessly into the corner,
                  began to exhibit signs of animation, and gradually, as though loth to leave even
                  such a bed, the small form of a boy emerged from the loathsome place. He had
                  scarce numbered ten summers, and yet his face wore a look of care and anxiety,
                  befitting one of mature years. Covered with rags and filth, his long, uncombed
                  hair of reddish hue falling unheeded about his face and neck, he was a pitiably
                  revolting object. And yet, none who knew how his young shoulders had borne their
                  heavy burden, or how the springs of love and hope, ever gushing through
                  childhood's heart, had been dried within him, could have looked upon him without
                  interest. One Eye alone had seen his utter misery, and though he knew it not, an
                  unseen hand was even now guiding him through bitter trials, to a bright hereafter.
                  All that poor Lonny knew, or felt on this cold, frosty morning, as he so
                  reluctantly roused himself from his blessed oblivion to care, was that, somehow or
                  other, he must make a fire to warm "poor gran'ther," and then go forth, faint with
                  hunger as he was, to his daily morning task of begging. The gleam of sunshine,
                  which still rested so kindly on the old man's form, seemed to infuse some of its
                  cheerfulness into the boy, for he quickly slipped his feet into a pair of cast-off
                  shoes he had picked up the day before, and tying them on with a strip of coarse
                  cloth, thus completed his toilet.</p>
               <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7276-00000007"/>
               <p>"Now, Lonny, that's a good boy," said old Paul, as he watched his movements.</p>
               <p>Lonny rubbed his eyes and looked with amazement at the old man, for he had been so
                  long used to his impatience and fretfulness, he could scarce trust himself that he
                  heard aright.</p>
               <p>"What ails ye, gran'ther?" he asked in surprise.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, boy. I feel strangely this morning."</p>
               <p>"I should think you did," murmured the boy, as he collected the few bits of refuse
                  wood they had saved from their yesterday's supply, and placing them on the old
                  hearth, made several ineffectual efforts to ignite the rubbish. The broken-down
                  chimney did not aid him in these efforts, and as he puffed and blew with all his
                  strength to awaken some latent spark, his eyes were filled with the smoke which
                  rolled in such clouds through the apartment as dimmed the sun's pure light.</p>
               <p>"O dear—dear;" cried old Paul, coughing between each word, "can't you help making
                  such a smoke? it chokes me terribly; there, let it be till you go out and find
                  some lighter stuff."</p>
               <p>"Why, gran'ther," replied the boy, "I picked up all I could find yesterday, and
                  they told me down to the new house they're building, never to show my scarecrow
                  face there again," and he applied himself yet more vigorously, till he was
                  rewarded by seeing a bright flame shoot up the smoky hole, and soon the whole
                  crackled and glowed with a pleasant sound.</p>
               <p>There, gran'ther," said Lonny, pointing with pride to the bright blaze, "haint I
                  made you a good fire now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my boy; and may be you won't ever have to make another for me," feebly
                  replied the sick man.</p>
               <p>Lonny looked wonderingly into his face; and catching with quick perception the
                  change there, crept softly and almost fearfully to his grandfather's side. The
                  imbecile look and childish querulousness to which he had been so long accustomed,
                  were gone, and in their stead the calm gaze of those mild blue eyes was bent upon
                  him in loving solicitude. The child felt the mystery, and closer drew to his only
                  earthly friend and protector, as he timidly asked, "Why shan't I never make you
                  another fire, gran'ther?"</p>
               <p>"I said, maybe you wouldn't," replied the old man hastily, unwilling to confess
                  his fears. "But run now, Lonny, and find some more fagots, and see what you I can
                  get for your breakfast; and when you come back, call at the Squire's, and ask that
                  good lady to come over here. I must see her to-day."</p>
               <p>Exhausted with his effort to speak, Paul Brown sank back on his rag pillow, while
                  Lonny, placing on his head an apology for a cap, went quietly out, wondering what
                  made gran'ther talk so strangely, and look so very white.</p>
               <p>Crisp, crisp, went his little feet over the untrodden snow,—for their hut stood
                  far back from the village road,—and warm, warm was the bright shroud the sun
                  wrapped about him; but all the while he kept thinking and wondering what made
                  gran'ther so changed. All<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7276-00000008"/> unheeded was the
                  noiseless stride of a skeleton messenger, as, with a ghastly grin and nod, it
                  swiftly passed the boy to fulfil its dread mission. Its icy breath made him shiver
                  and look around. "What a cold blast that was," thought he as he quickened his
                  steps.</p>
               <p>Presently the sound of merry voices reached his ear, and soon a troop of light,
                  rosy faces came bounding along in noisy glee, on their way to school. Lonny crept
                  behind a great stone, where he could watch them, unseen in his hiding-place. Poor
                  fellow! how he longed to join the happy group, and how utterly forsaken and lonely
                  he seemed then. He was young to feel such bitter pangs, and yet he was old in
                  suffering, for his ten years of life had comprised as much misery, as is often
                  eked out to the "threescore and ten." But the prattle of the gay, thoughtless
                  children drove every thing from his mind, and for the moment he fancied himself
                  like one of them. His heart throbbed with a strange feeling of gladness, and in
                  his trembling eagerness he stretched forth his arms to embrace these kindred
                  spirits. In so doing he exposed himself to their view, and such a shout as they
                  raised nearly crazed him.</p>
               <p>"Holloa, you ragamuffin, where'd <emph>you</emph> drop from?" cried one of the
                  larger boys, while the girls shrunk back in affright.</p>
               <p>"By jolly, what a scarecrow!" exclaimed another, "let's see what he's made of;"
                  and whizz, went a large snow-ball, aimed at the head of the poor boy, carrying
                  with it his remnant of a cap.</p>
               <p>"Good! go it again! down with red-top," shouted several of the mischief-loving
                  rogues, as they poured a volley of the white missiles about the unoffending
                  boy.</p>
               <p>For a moment Lonny stood amidst the taunts and pelting in silence, his bosom
                  heaving and his eye growing dark with passion, till, suddenly springing upon the
                  foremost boy, he dealt him a blow that sent him sprawling into the snow.</p>
               <p>"That's it;" "pitch into his rags;" "at it again," "bloody his nose for him;"
                  screamed the boys, as they rushed upon the intruder, who sprang like a cat behind
                  the wall again, with a defiant glance at them.</p>
               <p>"Who's afraid o' you, you little beggar?" they cried, showering him again with
                  snow-balls.</p>
               <p>"Now, boys, you're too bad," exclaimed a little golden-haired girl, stepping into
                  the midst of them: "that's the poor little boy that comes to our house most every
                  day for something to eat, and Aunt Lottie says we should always treat poor folks
                  kindly."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! Nettie; how like a fool you talk," said her brother Albert, who was the
                  first offender; "mother says poor folks aint fit to live, and I guess mother knows
                  best; so here goes again."</p>
               <p>But this time his was a solitary snow-ball, for Nettie's silvery voice was like
                  oil upon the troubled waters, as she cried, "for shame! for shame! Ally."</p>
               <p>"You'd better go long about your business, Net; mother says you're always
                  bothering her about some dirty brat or other. I spose you'd like now to kiss that
                  little savage yonder, wouldn't you?" sneeringly asked Ally.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7276-00000009"/>
               <p>"No, I wouldn't like to kiss him," she artlessly replied, "cause he's dirty and
                  ragged, and—and—may be he's ugly, but I wish he'd got as good clothes as we have,
                  and could go to school and learn as we do; maybe he'd be good then."</p>
               <p>Perfect embodiment of angelic beauty and purity was little Nettie Atherton, as she
                  stood thus confronting her rude brother, and earnestly pleading for the
                  world-forsaken boy. Lonny gazed upon her, spell-bound,—he almost expected to see
                  her spread her wings and fly up into the sky, like the pictures of angels he had
                  once or twice seen.</p>
               <p>Instead of that she came towards him, and said in her own sweet, childish
                  tones,</p>
               <p>"I hope these naughty boys haven't hurt you much, have they? I'm sure
                     <emph>I</emph> pity you, poor little boy."</p>
               <p>Her words recalled him to his senses, and, darting an angry look at the rude boys,
                  he replied: "I don't want nobody to pity me;" then turning, he ran as fast as his
                  feet could carry him, back to his poor home, and throwing himself upon his bed of
                  rags, sobbed and cried till it seemed that his young heart must break.</p>
               <p>"Poor boy! poor boy!" feebly murmured old Paul Brown, as he listened to his sobs;
                  "he'll have to go to the poorhouse,—there's no help for it now—unless—unless—I
                  could tell somebody about—his father."</p>
               <p>The last words were uttered as though each syllable was wrung from the depths of a
                  bitter fountain.</p>
               <p>The first paroxysm of Lonny's grief passed, he began to think over his morning's
                  adventure. At first his breath came thick and fast at the cruelty and injustice of
                  the boys; but deep down into his heart sank the remembrance of an angel face, and
                  sweet pleading voice, whose tones still lingered like olian music in his ear. Then
                  her words seemed to awaken a new thought, for he sprang up hastily, saying,</p>
               <p>"Gran'ther, what do boys and girls go to school for?"</p>
               <p>"To get larnin', child; what do you ask that for?"</p>
               <p>"'Cause; why don't I go? and why don't I have such clothes as they do?"</p>
               <p>A look of anguish passed over old Paul's face, as he replied—</p>
               <p>"Poor folks like us shouldn't never have no larnin'; that's what killed your poor
                  mother, and broke us all up; if she'd never had no larnin', she'd a been content
                  with her old father and mother. Don't get larnin', boy, don't—don't."</p>
               <p>"O gran'ther," cried Lonny, opening wide his eyes, "did I ever have a mother?"</p>
               <p>"None that you knew on, for she died when you was born; but she was as putty a
                  pictur as ever you did see—my Alice was,"—and two great tears rolled down his
                  furrowed cheeks, to the memory of the lost and loved one—the first he had shed for
                  many a year.</p>
               <p>"Tell me about her, gran'ther," eagerly exclaimed Lonny; "was that her name that
                  you said?"</p>
               <p>"Alice?—yes; my Alice was her name," fondly<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7276-00000010"
                  /> murmured the old man, dwelling lovingly on a name he had not uttered for ten
                  years.</p>
               <p>"Did I have a father too, gran'ther?" asked Lonny, timidly, as he thought of the
                  happy children he had seen with fathers and mothers.</p>
               <p>Paul Brown's face grew so dark and stern, it frightened the boy, as he
                  replied—"Never speak of him, Lonny; he was a bad, wicked man; and yet," he added,
                  in a very low voice, "who knows but he might a' done something for the
                  boy—if—if—we'd a told him."</p>
               <p>"Alice,"—the password to the secret chambers of his soul, had been spoken, and
                  forth thronged memories filled with the redolence of early years. The wife of his
                  youth,—their long and pleasant companionship,—the prattle of a little blue-eyed
                  cherub—his Alice, the love that bade them toil day and night, that their pearl
                  might be polished for a bright setting,—their pride and joy in the surpassing
                  beauty of their treasure—O why must the bright vision be followed by the dark
                  phantoms of sin, misery, and death? Yet thus it was; and though his life had since
                  become a blank in his remembrance, the old man knew that from the wreck of all his
                  hopes, only this poor, innocent boy—child of his lost Alice, was left to him. And
                  now the little fellow must live on, friendless and alone, unless he could disclose
                  the name of him who had desolated his home, and claim for the boy a father's
                  protection and care. Paul writhed with agony at the thought of yielding up his
                  hoarded secret, but well he knew that death stood even now at the threshold,
                  waiting but this last act of justice, ere he claimed his own.</p>
               <p>"Lonny, go quick and call somebody in," at length he uttered with thickening
                  breath; "poor boy, I'll wrong you no longer."</p>
               <p>"What for, gran'ther? who shall I call?" asked the frightened boy,</p>
               <p>"Call somebody that's good, and tell 'em I'm dying."</p>
               <p>Lonny waited for no more, but ran with all his might towards Squire Atherton's.
                  "I'll get HER—Aunt Lottie"—said he to himself; "I know she's good."</p>

               <p>MARK ATHERTON, Esq., was the oracle of the Clifton people. He was not only the
                  richest man in town, living in the handsomest house, wearing the finest
                  broadcloth, and owning the most elegant equipage, but he was the only lawyer in
                  all the region, dispensing evenhanded justice throughout his jurisdiction, with
                  such fidelity to the <emph>right,</emph> that few ever thought of appealing from
                  his decisions. To the blessed home influences of his childhood and youth—to the
                  mother, whose earnest prayers that her children might love the good and eschew the
                  evil, were indelibly written in his heart, did he ascribe those intuitions of
                  right and wrong. And when death placed its cold seal on the loved and honored lips
                  which had taught him such lessons of wisdom, the ark of the covenant seemed still
                  to rest with him, as he received into his house the living image of her who bore
                  him—his only sister, Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Not until his own heart vibrated with a thrill of delight, to the music of little
                  voices around his hearth, did he fully estimate the value of the character his
                  mother had moulded. Love had led him blindfold to the altar, when he gave his
                  heart and hand to Louisa Manning; but gradually the scales fell from his eyes, as
                  the simple and unostentatious piety of his sister's life, made more striking by
                  its contrast, the hardhearted, worldly selfishness of one he had thought so near
                  perfection. Still, with all her faults, Mark Atherton loved his wife, and trusted
                  much to the gentle influences of his sister in softening the asperity of her
                  temper. And so for several years, at the time our story opens, had Charlotte
                  Atherton, or "Aunt Lottie," as she was familiarly called by all the family, been
                  domesticated under her brother's roof. Many were the alluring homes which, with
                  the noble hearts of their owners, had been eagerly urged upon her acceptance; but
                  Aunt Lottie, while gaining a friend in each rejected lover, found among them all
                  none who fully met the wants of her heart. And so, every body said that "Aunt
                  Lottie" was destined to be an "old maid," and so thought the maiden herself, as
                  she approached her twenty-seventh birth-day, and none had stirred the deep fount
                  of love within her. If the people of Clifton honored truth and justice in the
                  person of Esquire Atherton, they worshipped no less the beautiful and good in his
                  lovely sister. Not an abode of poverty or want, not a<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000012"/> bed of sickness or sorrow, but had been cheered by
                  the sweet tones of her voice as she ministered to their necessities, mingling with
                  words of kindness bright hopes for the future.</p>
               <p>The days and months which had so wearily dragged along poor old Paul Brown's life
                  to its close, had been spent by Aunt Lottie among her friends abroad; else the
                  bitterness of his life would have been softened by her gentle ministrations, and
                  conscience perchance, awakened sooner to the duty he owed the little companion of
                  his misery—his orphan grandchild.</p>
               <p>But now Aunt Lottie has returned, to the delight of all the village; and as her
                  light footsteps glide through many a well-remembered door, mists of sorrow and
                  darkness vanish in the sunshine and warmth of her loving heart. But in her soft
                  hazel eye beams a light, taken only from love's altar; and the secret she so
                  sedulously strives to conceal, betrays itself in the rosy hue of her cheek, and
                  the palpitating eagerness with which she receives the post's daily treasure. Yes,
                  Aunt Lottie's heart has at last found its resting-place, and her future seems
                  radiant with happiness, pure and enduring. The same bright rays, which shed a
                  momentary light into the hearts of the poor suffering outcasts in the lonely hut,
                  on that cold morning in January, gently laid a warm blessing on the head of the
                  maiden, as in her solitary chamber she sat, in deep reverie, still holding before
                  her an open letter, which for the last half hour had filled her thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Next week!" at length she exclaimed, while a bright blush stole over cheek and
                  brow, "what will Mark say, when I find courage to tell him? Next week! why,
                  Melville said he should not come for two months, and it is scarcely three weeks
                  since I got home! I will write to him that I have not yet confided our secret to
                  my brother, and he must wait a little longer."</p>
               <p>"Please, Miss Charlotte," said a servant as she knocked at the door, "the little
                  beggar boy wants to see you very badly."</p>
               <p>"What beggar boy, Margaret?" asked Aunt Lottie, as she carefully locked in her
                  writing-desk the precious missive.</p>
               <p>"The one that used to come here every day for cold victuals; I guess you never see
                  him though, cause he never come till after you went away, and he haint been here
                  lately. He said something or other about his gran'ther's dying, and wanting to see
                  you."</p>
               <p>"It must be some case of distress that I knew nothing of," said Aunt Lottie,
                  hastening down to the kitchen.</p>
               <p>There, away in one corner of the room, frightened at his own boldness, the poor
                  shivering fellow had shrunk; he dared not raise his eyes, till he heard a pleasant
                  voice exclaim,</p>
               <p>"Why! what is this, cook?"</p>
               <p>"The boy, ma'am," was the reply, "he wouldn t go away till he'd seen you; you've
                  got your hands full now, ma'am, I reckon."</p>
               <p>"Poor little fellow! what can I do for you?" said Aunt Lottie, looking kindly at
                  the forlorn object.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7276-00000013"/>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> don't want nothin'," replied the boy; "but gran'ther says he is a
                  dying, and wants somebody to come quick."</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?"</p>
               <p>"Way over in the fields yonder."</p>
               <p>"What, in that old broken-down hut? who lives with you there?"</p>
               <p>"Nobody but gran'ther and me."</p>
               <p>"Who takes care of you?"</p>
               <p>"Nobody."</p>
               <p>"I sh'd think so," muttered the cook, casting a side look at the boy's tangled
                  locks and filthy rags.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, my poor boy?" asked Aunt Lottie, whose heart warmed towards
                  such friendless poverty.</p>
               <p>"Lonny."</p>
               <p>"And you say your grandfather is sick?"</p>
               <p>"I don' no, ma'am; he said he was a dyin, and told me to run quick and get
                  somebody."</p>
               <p>"Have you had any breakfast to-day, Lonny?"</p>
               <p>"No ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Nor your grandfather, either?"</p>
               <p>"No ma'am; he said he didn't want any, 'cause he's a dyin'," said the boy, utterly
                  unconscious of the dread import of the words he repeated.</p>
               <p>"This is really a pitiable case," said Aunt Lottie, turning to the cook, "and
                  while you give him some nice, warm breakfast, I will put up a few things in a
                  basket, and get ready to go with him."</p>
               <p>"There, boy," said the cook, as she obeyed her instructions structions, "it's well
                  for you the Squire's lady didn't see you first, or you'd a been packed off in a
                  hurry without this;" and the kind-hearted woman placed a most savory dish before
                  him.</p>
               <p>"I wish there was lots more o' just such kind o' folks in this world," she
                  continued, wiping her eye with a corner of her apron, as the little fellow
                  betrayed his half-starved condition; "howsomever, she'll never be none the worse
                  off for it, bless her kind soul."</p>
               <p>"Now, Lonny," said Aunt Lottie, coming in equipped for her walk, "if you've had a
                  good breakfast and will show me the way, I'll go with you and see your
                  grandfather."</p>
               <p>The boy cast a quick, grateful look at her, as he replied,</p>
               <p>"Yes ma'am."</p>
               <p>"What made you think of coming after me?" she asked, as they walked along.</p>
               <p>Lonny thought a moment, and then, in his simple, artless, ignorant way, told his
                  morning's adventure.</p>
               <p>"Ah," said Aunt Lottie, smiling, "just like my little darling Nettie; she will
                  always be a peacemaker."</p>
               <p>Had any other than Charlotte Atherton been seen toiling through the snow, basket
                  in hand, with that squalid-looking child at her side, many a passing jest would
                  have met her ear; but with only now and then a hearty "God bless you" from
                  grateful lips, she quietly moved along on heavenly mission. She sees not those
                  white-robed guides, with loving arms outstretched about her, as, showering sweet
                  incense on her path,<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7276-00000014"/> they lead her on to
                  the poor, sinking spirit, soon to be borne on their bright wings beyond the reach
                  of sorrow and pain. Mortal vision cannot pierce the thin veil which enshrouds
                  spirit life, else Aunt Lottie, as she entered that most wretched of all human
                  abodes, would have seen it filled with beings of radiant beauty, waiting to
                  welcome the outcast from earth to their glowing hearts.</p>
               <p>"Come—quick," cried old Paul, with short gasping breath, as Lonny, with his new
                  friend, approached the corner where the dying man lay.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lottie knew at a glance, that the fettered soul's release was at hand, and
                  tenderly taking the cold, shrivelled hand within her own, she said,—"Is your heart
                  at rest, my friend?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," gasped he, "I trust—in—God—but"—then drawing from his bosom a dirty
                  leathern bag, he put it in her hand, with an anxious look.</p>
               <p>"What is this?" asked Aunt Lottie, with surprise, as she opened it and took from
                  it, carefully wrapped in cotton, a miniature of an exquisitely beautiful girl.</p>
               <p>"His—mother—my—Al"—but the palsied tongue refused to utter that loved name, and a
                  look of agony passed over his pallid face, as he struggled but for one more word.
                  In vain were all Aunt Lottie's restoratives,—nought but death can loose that
                  tongue again.</p>
               <p>"Poor sufferer," exclaimed Aunt Lottie; "he has something on his mind he wants to
                  tell me."</p>
               <p>The dying man grasped her hand as she said this, while every feature was distorted
                  in his vain efforts to speak.</p>
               <p>"Is it about this poor boy?" asked she, as a sudden thought struck her.</p>
               <p>He pressed her hand in assent.</p>
               <p>"Is this—his mother—alive?" pointing to the picture.</p>
               <p>He shook his head.</p>
               <p>"His father dead, too?" Aunt Lottie was becoming more and more distressed, as she
                  saw the dew of death gather on his brow, and still the secret unrevealed.</p>
               <p>Paul Brown threw his arms wildly about, in unutterable anguish at this last
                  question.</p>
               <p>"Sh—h," whispered Lonny, "he told me never to speak about him, 'cause he is a
                  wicked, bad man."</p>
               <p>"His secret, whatever it was, has gone with him to the eternal world," solemnly
                  added Aunt Lottie, as she reverently closed the eyes of the dead.</p>

               <p>"GOOD friends all, great and small, how d'ye do?" exclaimed the cheerful voice of
                  Joseph Atherton, as he opened the sitting-room door where his brother's family
                  were seated at the tea-table.</p>
               <p>"Why Joe, you are right welcome," cried Esquire Atherton, springing from his chair
                  and grasping his hand cordially, "this is a pleasant surprise."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Uncle Joseph! Uncle Joseph!" shouted the children, clapping their hands for
                  joy, "I'm <emph>so</emph> glad you've come."</p>
               <p>"Glad to see me, are you, you little rogues? Give me a real good hug and kiss
                  then;—there—there, that'll do; I want to save one for your mother and Aunt
                  Lottie."</p>
               <p>"My queenly sister Louisa, I must have something better than that," said the new
                  comer, as he took Mrs. Atherton's extended hand, and then pressed a most brotherly
                  salute on her fair cheek, to her evident disgust.</p>
               <p>"Lottie, darling, last but not least," and Uncle Joseph drew his
                     <emph>favorite</emph> to his heart, while she fairly wept for joy on his
                  breast.</p>
               <p>"Now, Joe," said his brother, as they re-seated themselves at the table, "this is
                  indeed pleasant; but why didn't your wife come with you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, bless your soul, my Henny couldn't leave the dairy; there's the milk to take
                  care of, butter and cheese to make, besides the young lambs to look after," and
                  Uncle Joseph cast a mischievous glance towards the dignified lady at the head of
                  the table.</p>
               <p>"I should suppose," said she, "you would have men to look after such things; it
                  isn't fit for ladies."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well," he replied good-naturedly, "my wife was never cut out for a fine lady,
                  you know; she's just as much at home among the chickens, pigs, and geese, as you
                  are in a drawing-room."</p>
               <p>"She makes a capital farmer's wife," added Esquire Atherton.</p>
               <p>"That she does," said Joseph, his face glowing with pleasure, "you must all come
                  over to Daisyside next spring, and see for yourselves what a plump rosy little
                  wife I've got."</p>
               <p>"Oh, may we go, mother?" asked littte Nettie joyfully.</p>
               <p>"To be sure you may, my little flaxen-haired doll," said Uncle Joseph, patting her
                  head, "and frisk about<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7276-00000016"/> with the lambs,
                  and feed the chickens, and ride on old Carlo's back when he goes after the cows,
                  and ever so many other things just as pleasant."</p>
               <p>"Mother, <emph>will</emph> you go?" persisted the delighted child.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps Aunt Lottie will take you there," replied Mrs. Atherton haughtily;
                     "<emph>I</emph> never could endure the air of a farm-yard."</p>
               <p>Aunt Lottie looked almost like a culprit, when urged by the children to
                     <emph>promise</emph> them she would go. She knew that before that time, another
                  home would claim her as its mistress.</p>
               <p>"By the way," said Joseph suddenly, "where's the boy you wrote to me about,
                  Lottie?"</p>
               <p>A threatening gesture from her checked him.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I thought they knew all about it."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" asked Mark, "has she been interesting you in some of her protgs? She
                  has plenty of them here."</p>
               <p>"Too many for her own good," added Mrs. Mark with asperity.</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that, wife," replied her husband warmly; "if the prayers of
                  the poor avail aught, our Lottie will have a most blessed life, both here and
                  hereafter."</p>
               <p>"The prayers of the poor!" sneered Mrs. Atherton; "pray, when did you ever hear
                  one that was not utterly selfish?"</p>
               <p>"O fie, Louisa," exclaimed Joseph, earnestly; "give me the prayers of the poor,
                  and the rich may pray as they like, for aught I care."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton left the room with her children, not wishing such lessons impressed
                  on their minds. Albert, the eldest, a boy of ten, was after his mother's own
                  heart—"a perfect Manning," as she often used to say with pride,—but Nettie—the
                  sweet, golden-haired Nettie—Aunt Lottie's pet from her birth, shocked continually
                  her mother's nice sense of the <emph>pride of station.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Now, Joseph," said Aunt Lottie eagerly, as she was left alone with her brothers,
                  "tell me what you intend to do about the boy."</p>
               <p>"Intend! why, I intend to keep him from starving, to be sure, and if my wise
                  little sister here thinks it best, I shall take him home with me, and make a man
                  of him."</p>
               <p>"That's just what I expected, you dear, good, kind soul; Oh, how thankful I
                  am."</p>
               <p>"Not so fast, Lottie, not so fast, or you'll make me think I'm doing some great
                  deed, when the truth is, Henny and I have got to thinking how nice it would be to
                  have some one to love us and to take care of us when we are old; so you see it's
                  all selfishness, every bit."</p>
               <p>"I see no such thing, my dear brother," gratefully replied Lottie. "You cannot
                  hide that noble heart beneath such a false covering."</p>
               <p>"Well, really," exclaimed Mark, who had been an interested listener, "I should
                  like to deserve such a compliment as that from our Lottie. Pray, what boy are you
                  speaking of?"</p>
               <p>"The one whose grandfather was buried last week<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000017"/> from that miserable old shanty; you know who I
                  mean, Mark, for you bought the coffin, and furnished the poor child a decent suit
                  of clothes. Are your deeds of kindness so many you have forgotten that?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Lottie; would that they were. I recollect very well the
                  transformation you effected in the worst looking specimen of childhood I ever saw.
                  But surely, Joe, you are not going to take that little fellow home!"</p>
               <p>"Why not, Mark? he'll have to go to the poor-house if I don't. And Lottie thinks I
                  can make something of him."</p>
               <p>"Why, he was the most ungainly looking object your eyes ever rested on, before
                  Lottie took him in hand."</p>
               <p>"Ah! but you should see him now, Mark," said Lottie proudly, "he is really a very
                  pretty boy—bright and intelligent too, for one who has led such a life; Joseph, I
                  know, will make a good boy of him, and only think how thankful he will be by and
                  by, for such a home and friends."</p>
               <p>"And how thankful he ought to be," added her brother, smiling, "for such a pleader
                  as you are. You'd better take him, Joe; I'd trust Lottie's judgment in such a
                  case."</p>
               <p>"That's just what Henny and I said when we got Lottie's letter, and so I came
                  right off after him."</p>
               <p>"Ridiculous! abominable! past all endurance!" were Mrs. Atherton's exclamations,
                  when her husband told her Uncle Joseph's errand. "'Tis astonishing how some people
                  do like to set beggars on horseback. I think, Mr. Atherton, it is time you put a
                  stop to your sister Charlotte's disgraceful behavior. Why, I absolutely saw her
                  walking through the street yesterday, taking hold of that little pauper's
                  hand!"</p>
               <p>"What was there disgraceful about that, Louisa?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Atherton, you are so provoking!—as if there was nothing disgraceful in
                  people of <emph>our</emph> station letting themselves down to a level with
                  beggars."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but Lottie don't do that, my dear; she tries to raise them to her
                  level."</p>
               <p>"Which can never be done;" rejoined Mrs. Atherton decidedly: "Look at that boy,
                  for instance, whom your brother's extreme folly will place in a condition above
                  his birth; do you suppose all the education he can give him will blot out the
                     <emph>beggar</emph> from his veins?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Louisa, one would think, to hear you talk, that you considered the rich and
                  poor two distinct races of beings. I shouldn't wonder now, if brother Joe made
                  something smart out of that little fellow yet."</p>
               <p>"Smart, or not;" Mrs. A. replied, "<emph>my</emph> children shall never step their
                  foot inside his house, while that low-lived boy is there."</p>
               <p>"Oh come, come, wife, don't let your prejudices run away with you so," said her
                  husband good-naturedly." "'Tis not what outward seems, but what's
                     <emph>within</emph> that makes the man."</p>
               <p>"Mother! mother!" cried Albert, bursting into the room, his cheek flushed with
                  anger, "Nettie says Uncle Joseph is going to take that little beggar home with<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7276-00000018"/> him, and he is to be our cousin; he ain't
                  going to, is he, mother?"</p>
               <p>"He's going home with your Uncle Joseph, I suppose," replied his mother in a
                  bitter tone, "but he's not to be your cousin, and I shall severely punish either
                  of you, if you call him so."</p>
               <p>"There, I told Nettie so; but she said if Uncle Joseph took him, you would let us
                  love him; <emph>I</emph> won't though: I'll call him a little beggar brat every
                  time I see him."</p>
               <p>Oh, false and erring mother! deeply may you yet rue the day when you planted such
                  seeds of bitterness in that young heart. Perchance their springing up may fill
                  your own path with thorns, whose poisoned barb shall rankle in your bosom with
                  terrible retribution.</p>
               <p>What a different scene did Nurse Walton's little parlor present, during this
                  domestic tte--tte at Esq. Atherton's. Uncle Joseph's round genial face fairly
                  shone with joy, as he saw the happiness of the hitherto friendless lad, when told
                  by Aunt Lottie of the home and friends he would find, if he proved a good boy. She
                  had taken him from his grandfather's death-bed to the cottage of good old Nurse
                  Walton, in whom she always found an efficient co-operator in her benevolent plans.
                  Nurse's ready hands had fashioned for him a plain but neat suit of clothes, and,
                  with the help of scissors and brush, his matted locks had changed to soft and
                  glossy auburn hair. Wonderful was the transformation, as Lonny stepped forth in
                  his new habiliments, his dark blue eye speaking the gratitude his lips could not
                  frame.</p>
               <p>"There, Joseph," said his sister, proudly placing the boy's hand in his, "you have
                  saved the poor fellow from a life of poverty, perhaps crime. Brought up under your
                  roof, I know he will lead a useful and happy life."</p>
               <p>"Wal, if ever I <emph>did,</emph>" cried old Nurse Walton, wiping her eye with the
                  corner of her apron, "there's Miss Lottie been a drudging night and day to fix
                  that boy up, and writ to her brother to get him a place, and now she says
                     <emph>he</emph> done it all. Some folks is drefful like angels in this
                  world."</p>
               <p>"O nurse, nurse," said Lottie, laughing, "don't make such a comparison in my case;
                  I have done so little, you fairly make me ashamed; I couldn't keep the boy from
                  the poor-house, if my generous brother here hadn't given him a home."</p>
               <p>"There it is again, Lottie, when I told you 'twas all selfishness that made Henny
                  and I want some one to love us. Call it <emph>generous</emph> to take such a boy
                  as this, when he's worth a thousand dollars this minute;" and Uncle Joseph patted
                  the boy affectionately, while he drew him closer to his side. "What do you say,
                  Lonny? won't we have a good time when we get home, driving horses, milking cows,
                  and going to school too?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed! O, I'm so glad."</p>
               <p>Lonny's eyes sparkled with delight, and Nettie clapped her hands for joy—"O, won't
                  that be nice?" cried she; "and then when I come to see you we will<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000019"/> play together after school; you'll be my cousin
                  then, and I'll love you—Oh, so much."</p>
               <p>Her mother's mandate was all unknown to the artless prattler, and unlearned was
                  the worldly lesson soon to be enforced.</p>
               <p>Lonny could not make the present seem <emph>real</emph> to him. He had often had
                  such dreams on his rag bed in the hovel, and he was almost afraid he should wake
                  up, as he had before, and find himself still in the neglected corner. His heart
                  was burning with an intensity they little dreamed, who were thus turning his
                  bitter life-stream into sweet and flowing waters.</p>
               <p>"'Taint none o' my business, I spose;" said Nurse Walton, shielding her eyes from
                  the dazzling snow-light, as she watched Joseph Atherton wrap his little charge so
                  warmly in his sleigh, and drive off with a happy face; "taint none o' my business;
                  but it does seem as if some folks was likelier 'n others. There's the Squire's
                  stuck up lady, wouldn't have that boy come inside her door, and now Joe Atherton's
                  took him, and I shouldn't wonder a mite if he made a smarter boy on him than hern,
                  arter all. There always was likely blood in them Athertons."</p>
               <p>Never, in all life's changes, did Lonny forget this, his first ride—how the merry
                  jingle of the sleigh bells, as they glided swiftly over the snow, awoke the joyous
                  echo of new-born hope within his darkened soul; how, as houses, trees, fields, and
                  villages flew past them, he saw a new world open before him, while the terrible
                  dream of the past seemed fading away, away in the distance tance. Nor less did the
                  noble heart beside him throb with delight, as he watched the happy, beaming face,
                  and saw the joy of the young heart he had loosed from its prison. Joseph Atherton,
                  in all his deeds of kindness—and they were many—had never felt such unmingled
                  happiness, as when he opened his heart and home to the poor isolated boy. And so
                  they rode on, hearts in unison with each other and with the bright world around
                  them,—Uncle Joseph picturing to his little hearer the pleasant home he would soon
                  have, and Lonny wondering if any body was ever so good to a poor boy before.</p>
               <p>Daisyside, the picturesque home of Joseph Atherton, stood on a gentle eminence
                  overlooking the quiet little village of T——. Around it on every side the broad
                  acres of his thrifty farm stretched out, diversified with hill and dale, woodland
                  and meadow. A summer visitant there would not ask whence it derived its name; for
                  at almost every step through the green lawns, the bright-eyed daisy decked his
                  path in profusion. Dearly the mistress of this beautiful home loved these little
                  flowers, for they accorded well with her own cheerful and happy temper; like them
                  she breathed gladness and sunshine all about her. Daisyside, beautiful as it was,
                  had still a greater charm in the generous, whole-souled hospitality of its owners.
                  Rich and poor were alike welcome to its fireside and table,—nay, if any preference
                  was shown, Henrietta Atherton's pleasant voice was a little softer in its tone,
                  her greeting warmer and more kindly, as she opened her door to the child<pb
                     n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7276-00000020"/> of want. How Joseph Atherton ever found
                  such a perfect counterpart—such a second self, was a wonder to the neighbors; but
                  he used to say with a hearty laugh, that "his match was made in heaven, long
                  before he knew any thing about it; and when the right time came, his Eve was
                  placed by his side."</p>
               <p>Up the hill towards this home-Eden, toiled our travellers at the close of their
                  journey.</p>
               <p>"There, boy," said its owner, pointing with pride, "what do you think of that for
                  a home, hey?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, do you live in that big house, and am I going to live there too!" exclaimed
                  Lonny with rapture, as he drank in the whole scene.</p>
               <p>"Well, I shouldn't wonder," replied his companion, laughing, "but look there; see
                  those fellows coasting down that long hill. I took away the wall purpose for the
                  little rascals; to-morrow you shall have as good a sled as any of them, and we'll
                  see who'll be the spryest then."</p>
               <p>"Welcome home, husband," said the sweet voice of his wife, as Joseph Atherton drew
                  up before the door with his newly adopted charge. "So, this is the little boy, is
                  it?"</p>
               <p>Lonny looked up eagerly into the face beaming so kindly upon him; he had never
                  seen but one before that seemed so beautiful.</p>
               <p>"Oh! may I love you?" cried he in ecstasy.</p>
               <p>"Love me? to be sure you may," said she, with a low musical laugh, "and I know I
                  shall love you, for you look like a very good boy," and she took his hand and led
                  him gently in.</p>
               <p>What now to the happy boy were the years of misery he had dragged on? vanished
                  like the morning dew, in the new light dawning upon his existence.</p>
               <p>The poor, neglected, world-forsaken orphan, has found at last a
                  <emph>home!</emph>—home for the weary body, and more priceless still, home for the
                  yearning heart.</p>

               <p>MARK ATHERTON sat in his library, busily engaged in arranging some important
                  papers. Now and then his head would rest upon his hand, and a deep sigh escape
                  him, as some unhappy thought intruded itself. He had been unusually disturbed of
                  late by the exhibition of the darker traits in his wife's character. With a heart
                  full of generous sympathy for the wants and woes of others, he saw worth repulsed
                  with cold and cruel scorn, because clad in poor raiment. Even his own brother,
                  proverbially good and pure-minded, was not exempt from the contemptuous sneer of
                  this woman of the world, when he obeyed the promptings of his noble spirit, and
                  averted the curse of poverty from a young heart. And Lottie too, his ideal of a
                  perfect woman, had been denounced in terms neither mild nor loving. But worse than
                  all, his first-born, his noble boy, was daily imbibing these false and cruel
                  prejudices, and but for the bright example of his sister, perhaps his
                  tenderhearted, beautiful Nettie, might become cold and callous too. What wonder,
                  that thoughts like these oppressed his noble heart with painful misgivings and sad
                  forebodings. Hastily pushing aside his papers, and sinking back in his chair, Mr.
                  Atherton gave himself up to his gloomy reverie. Busy memory, ever at hand, threw
                  her golden chain about him, and far—far back to her brightest haunts would have
                  led him, but a light, familiar tap at the door dispelled her mystic presence, and
                  aroused the dreamer.</p>
               <p>"Come in, Lottie," cried he, "I am glad you've broken up this fit of musing; I
                  believe I'm getting low spirited to day."</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry for that, brother, for I want to consult you on a very important
                  matter."</p>
               <p>"Ah! what important project have you got in your head now? something for the
                  benefit of the poor, of course."</p>
               <p>"No, Mark, it is not that," said Lottie, coloring deeply, "it more nearly concerns
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"Concerns yourself!" repeated lie with surprise, "why Lottie, you blush like a
                  girl of sixteen in love. I should almost think you were, if such a thing seemed
                  possible."</p>
               <p>"Really then, you think I've no heart," laughingly replied she, with a glowing
                  cheek.</p>
               <p>"Heart! yes, you have—one of the best that ever throbbed," exclaimed her brother
                  warmly; "but what<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7276-00000022"/> is the 'important
                  matter,' Lottie? you have excited my curiosity greatly."</p>
               <p>"I thought I had courage to tell you," said Lottie, trembling with agitation;
                  "but—but—" she hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Why, Lottie, you surprise me more and more; here you stand, trembling and
                  changing color, like a culprit at the bar. Sit down now quietly, and tell me what
                  agitates you thus."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mark," said she, with attempted cheerfulness, "it was only in relation to
                  an expected visitor that I wished to consult you."</p>
               <p>"An expected visitor! where, and to whom?"</p>
               <p>"Here, and to me," replied Lottie, smiling and blushing again.</p>
               <p>"An expected visitor here and to you," her brother repeated: "that sounds ominous.
                  Another offer, I suppose; but you have been too much used to such things to be so
                  affected by it. Pray, who may it be?"</p>
               <p>"A Mr. Thornton, whom I met several times in my absence. Forgive me, dear brother,
                  that I did not confide this to you sooner, as was my intention when I
                  returned."</p>
               <p>"Do you love this Mr. Thornton, Lottie?" Mr. Atherton looked earnestly—almost
                  anxiously into her face for a reply.</p>
               <p>"I do, Mark," said she, in a low, tremulous tone, while a bright glow suffused her
                  cheek and brow.</p>
               <p>For a moment her brother covered his face; then, affectionately clasping her hand,
                  he said:</p>
               <p>"You have taken me so by surprise, Lottie, that I scarcely know what to say. I had
                  selfishly thought to keep you always near me, brightening my home as you have ever
                  done. But if my darling sister loves, and loves worthily, which I doubt not, then
                  may God bless her, even as she deserves to be blessed."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, brother," replied Lottie with emotion, "but the blessing would indeed
                  be small which should be proportioned to my merits, though not in your partial
                  judgment, I know."</p>
               <p>"Well, it seems I am not the only one that is partial," smilingly answered her
                  brother; "I could name three, or four, at least, who have paid their heart's
                  tribute to my sister's worth. The one who has gained such a coveted treasure as
                  your heart, Lottie, must be a perfect beau-ideal of excellence. Tell me more about
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I prefer that you should judge for yourself, Mark; he will be here this
                  afternoon, and I trust my brother will find that I have not chosen
                  unworthily."</p>
               <p>"Where is he from?"</p>
               <p>"He has but lately returned from abroad, where he has spent several years, I
                  believe, since his father's death."</p>
               <p>"He is rich then, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"I think not, though I know very little about it."</p>
               <p>"How old is he?"</p>
               <p>"Quite young enough for your old maid sister; he is thirty; but come, I'm not
                  going to be catechized any more," said Lottie, laughing.</p>
               <p>"One thing more, Lottie; was he ever married?"</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7276-00000023"/>
               <p>"I really do not know, Mark; he has often referred to an early grief which caused
                  him to go abroad; I shall doubtless know all at a proper time."</p>
               <p>"Still another thing, Lottie; you know I shall be argus-eyed about this man, who
                  comes to rob me of my sister. Is he your <emph>accepted</emph> lover?"</p>
               <p>"With the approbation of my brother, he is; otherwise he is not."</p>
               <p>"Let him look well to himself then," said Mr. Atherton, tenderly pressing her
                  hand, "for who receives this priceless gift from me, must be little less than
                  perfection itself."</p>
               <p>"I shall be satisfied with my brother's decision, I have no doubt," said Lottie,
                  smiling, "for <emph>I</emph> think he will bear your test. It will save some
                  confusion, perhaps," she added as she left the room, "if you will apprise Louisa
                  of what I have told you."</p>
               <p>"I'll go now," said he; "how astonished she will be."</p>
               <p>There are few characters so dark, but have some redeeming traits about them. Cold,
                  stern, and unrelenting as was Mrs. Atherton to the victims of poverty, or humble
                  birth, she was, <emph>in her own circle,</emph> a most agreeable companion. Her
                  well cultivated mind, refined and courteous manners, and face whose beauty needed
                  but a little <emph>warmth,</emph> rendered her a favorite among her equals. And at
                  home, when nothing disturbed her bitter prejudices, she was an affectionate mother
                  and kind wife. But Charlotte Atherton's self-denying, active, benevolent life, was
                  a perpetual annoyance to her, the more so perhaps, that her husband entered so
                  warmly into all his sister's plans. There were moments, however, when even her
                  selfish heart was forced to feel, though unacknowledged, the beauty and worth of
                  such a character; and, as if to atone for the intruding thought, her tone and
                  manner grew more bitter towards the unoffending object. In such a mood was she,
                  when her husband sought her to communicate the news.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Louisa!" exclaimed he, throwing himself into a chair, "you can't guess what
                  I've heard this morning."</p>
               <p>"What is it about?" she asked with some curiosity.</p>
               <p>"It's about our Lottie."</p>
               <p>"Humph! I guess all you hear about her had better not be repeated," said she with
                  a contemptuous shrug. "I'll warrant it's some disgraceful affair. I did think when
                  she palmed that beggar on to your brother, that she would be satisfied a while;
                  but she does seem to love low company."</p>
               <p>"Now, Louisa, you are ungenerous,"—and her husband spoke sternly. "You know very
                  well, that in all Lottie's acts of kindness to the poor, she feels that she is but
                  performing her duty—a pleasant duty certainly, to a heart like hers. But you have
                  seen, as well as I, how keenly she enjoys the society of the refined,—yes, and how
                  her society is prized by them too. Do you call those gentlemen who showed their
                  appreciation of her character by honorable proposals, <emph>low
                  company?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You forget, Mr. Atherton," sneeringly replied she, "that you are substantiating
                  my remark. Her very refusal of offers that any sensible woman would<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000024"/> have eagerly accepted, shows that she has no
                  sympathy with the cultivated and refined."</p>
               <p>"And you forget, Mrs. Atherton, that those very gentlemen are among her warmest
                  friends. Her delicate manner in declining proposals, of which any woman might be
                  proud, showing, as it did, the sincerity and purity of her heart, won for ever
                  their admiration and esteem."</p>
               <p>"For all that," added Mrs. Atherton, "you never can make me believe that they, or
                  any other gentlemen, will really respect her, while she associates, as she does,
                  with the low classes."</p>
               <p>"There you are again unjust, Louisa; she never associates with them as
                     <emph>companions.</emph> She hears and relieves their wants, sympathizes in
                  their trials, and, as often as she can, places them in a condition to rise above
                  their circumstances. She looks upon them as <emph>capable</emph> of being educated
                  and refined, like the rest of us. I have no doubt that, a few years hence, many in
                  high social positions will acknowledge their indebtedness to her for their
                  elevation. What an enviable reputation that would be!"</p>
               <p>"You have a very exalted opinion of your sister"—and Mrs. Atherton curled her lip
                  disdainfully,—"but I think you are alone in it; for my part, not a day passes that
                  I am not ashamed of her conduct."</p>
               <p>"You'll not have much longer to be ashamed of it," said her husband, "for Lottie
                  will soon be in a home of her own."</p>
               <p>"I wish I could think so," replied the heartless woman man, "for I do not wish my
                  children brought up under such influences. Nettie is almost ruined now."</p>
               <p>"Louisa!" exclaimed Mr. Atherton with a quivering lip, "can you forget another
                  child—our beautiful, dying boy? Who to him and us, in that terrible scene, was an
                  angel of mercy? whose voice, by the side of that little grave, soothed your
                  inordinate grief, and breathed submission into your heart? Oh! Louisa, your
                  conscience must tell you, that for all the unkindness you have shown my sister,
                  she has ever returned you <emph>good deeds.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton bit her lips in silence, while her husband threw himself upon a
                  lounge, too thoroughly disturbed to pursue the conversation further.</p>
               <p>"Come, Ally and Nettie," said their father at dinner, "what do you say to a good
                  sleigh-ride this afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes; do go," cried both children at once.</p>
               <p>"We'll take mother along, and leave Aunt Lottie to take care of the house—and
                  visitors too, if there should happen to be any," and Mr. Atherton glanced
                  significantly at his sister.</p>
               <p>"Oh! do let Aunt Lottie go too," coaxed Nettie; "if any body calls, Julia can tell
                  'em we're all gone. You will go, won't you, Aunt Lottie?"</p>
               <p>The tell-tale blush on her cheek was understood only by her brother, as she
                  replied,</p>
               <p>"No, darling, aunty can't go very well; she has got something to do."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" persisted Nettie; "can't I help you when we come back?"</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7276-00000025"/>
               <p>"Don't tease your aunt so," said her mother, who was heartily glad of her
                  husband's proposition; "if you don't like to ride with your father and mother, you
                  may stay at home with Aunt Lottie."</p>
               <p>"I do love you, mother, and father too," replied the sweet child, "but I'm afraid
                  Aunt Lottie'll be lonesome if we go and leave her all alone."</p>
               <p>"Never fear Aunt Lottie," said her father, smiling, "she always finds enough to do
                  to keep her from being lonesome. So, wrap yourselves up very warm, and be ready to
                  go in a few minutes, while I tell John to bring the horses round."</p>
               <p>A grateful smile from Lottie, as they rode off, told her brother that his simple
                  ruse was understood and appreciated.</p>
               <p>An hour later, and Melville Thornton stood before her,—the very impersonation of
                  manly beauty and high-souled nobility. Upon his features rested an habitual
                  expression of sadness, but when a smile shone there, its charm was indescribable.
                  Such a smile irradiated his face, as he clasped her small white hand within his
                  own.</p>
               <p>"I am so rejoiced," said he, "to find you alone. I feared you would be surrounded
                  by your friends, and thus our first meeting here rendered formal and cold."</p>
               <p>"And but for my brother's happy thoughtfulness, it would have been so," she
                  replied with a beaming eye.</p>
               <p>One lingering glance at the fair face of Charlotte Atherton, as it meets the
                  earnest gaze of her lover, and we leave them to the sacred interchange of the
                  heart's purest and holiest emotions.</p>
               <p>Beautiful she seemed to him, as he looked into the clear depths of her hazel eye,
                  and saw mirrored there the soul's purity. Melville Thornton had seen earth's
                  fairest daughters, in every clime; dark eyes had flashed upon him; languishing
                  beauty sighed in vain; not one answering throb quickened his heart, as for years
                  he moved among them, like some isolated being. But the simple, quiet, unpretending
                  loveliness of Charlotte Atherton, as he met her soon after his return from abroad,
                  while it won his admiration and esteem, awoke, almost imperceptibly, in the silent
                  chambers of his soul, a soft echo, whose tones, as louder and sweeter they grew,
                  filled him with a joy unknown before. Love's light, when first it beams into the
                  strong, <emph>mature</emph> heart, burns with an intensity far exceeding its
                  youthful fires. Thus it was that Melville Thornton, in life's prime, first laid
                  his heart's offering on the burning altar. And she, for whom this treasure has
                  been hoarded, all worthy the gift, hears in her own bosom the answering chord
                  which brings their hearts' melody in unison.</p>
               <p>Sparkling with life and gayety, Nettie bounded into the parlor, as the happy
                  sleigh-riders returned.</p>
               <p>"Oh, aunty!" cried she—but at that moment she glanced at the handsome, dark-browed
                  stranger, and shrunk, like a timid fawn, to her aunt's side.</p>
               <p>"Why Lottie, where did this little fairy spring from?" exclaimed Mr. Thornton in
                  admiration. "Come here, you little elf, that I may be sure you are flesh and
                  blood."</p>
               <p>Nettie looked at him in her artless, innocent way;<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000026"/> she liked that beautiful smile, and his kind,
                  pleasant voice; she was almost sure he must be good, and when he gently beckoned
                  her to him, she began, almost unconsciously, to draw a little nearer and nearer,
                  till, with the sweet instinct of childhood, she sprang into his proffered
                  arms.</p>
               <p>"Do you love little girls?" she asked timidly.</p>
               <p>"To be sure I do," said he, "especially such little girls as you."</p>
               <p>"Have you got any at home?"</p>
               <p>"No, I haven't, but I should like to take you home with me, and then I should have
                  a very nice one. Will you go?"</p>
               <p>"No, I can't; I'm Aunt Lottie's little pet; she'd be lonesome without me."</p>
               <p>"But what if Aunt Lottie would go too?" added he, with a mischievous smile.</p>
               <p>Nettie raised her wondering face to his. Just at that moment Mr. Atherton entered
                  the room with his wife, who saw with astonishment the distinguished-looking
                  foreigner, holding Nettie, so lovingly nestled in his lap. Before Lottie, in her
                  confusion, could introduce the stranger, Mr. Atherton advanced towards him, with a
                  puzzled look, scanning his features.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said he, "but your countenance is so familiar; I thought I knew
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Your memory is more treacherous than mine, Mark," said Mr. Thornton, grasping his
                  hand warmly, "you have forgotten, I see, your young college friend, Melville."</p>
               <p>"What! Melville Thornton? Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. Atherton. "Why Lottie,
                  did you mean this for a pleasant surprise?"</p>
               <p>"I am as much surprised as yourself, brother," Lottie blushingly answered; "I was
                  not before aware that you had ever met."</p>
               <p>"I kept that secret purposely," said Mr. Thornton, smilingly, "but this lady, who
                  I presume is Mrs. Atherton, I have never had the pleasure of seeing before."</p>
               <p>"Forgive my rudeness," said Mr. Atherton; "wife, allow me to introduce to you a
                  very dear friend of mine, Mr. Thornton."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton, who was delighted with the highbred, polished manners of their
                  guest, received him very graciously, and thus was Lottie spared her dreaded
                  task.</p>
               <p>Long and pleasant was the conference between the old friends in Mr. Atherton's
                  library that evening; and when, at its close, Mr. Atherton, with moistened eyes
                  and trembling lips, gave his warm approval of a union so fraught with happiness,
                  Melville Thornton felt that the dark day of his life might yet have a bright
                  setting.</p>
               <p>Only one condition did Mr. Atherton impose upon the happy lovers,—that his wife
                  should not be informed of their betrothal except by himself; he had a lesson in
                  store for her.</p>

               <p>"THAT'S the last thing I expected to hear," exclaimed Henrietta Atherton, as her
                  husband folded the letter he had just been reading to her; "who ever thought your
                  sister Lottie would get married? She always seemed to me too good for any
                  body."</p>
               <p>"I know somebody just as good," said he with an affectionate smile, "who was
                  married some six or seven years ago."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Joseph, you know I have never done half as much for the poor as your sister;
                  her example always reproves me."</p>
               <p>"Well, Henny, we won't dispute about your <emph>comparative</emph> goodness.
                  Heaven knows I have a better wife than I deserve, and so will this Mr. Thornton,
                  unless he is a paragon of perfection."</p>
               <p>"Your brother speaks very highly of him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it seems Mark knew him in college; he thinks him worthy even of Lottie's
                  hand. But I wonder what he wants us to be so very private about it for?"</p>
               <p>"He has some good reason for it, no doubt. Let me see, what shall I wear to the
                  wedding? Next week, you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, next Wednesday. Get something nice, Henny; you'll have time to make it, and
                  I want Mark's proud wife to see that my Henny can be as much of a lady as
                  she."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you foolish man,—to expect that a little homebody like me, can appear like
                  his tall, handsome, dignified wife."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't have you appear <emph>like</emph> her for any thing," said Joseph,
                  laughing," you'd drive <emph>me</emph> out of the house in ten minutes. Only be
                  yourself, Henny, and I am proud to place you beside that iceberg."</p>
               <p>"Mark's wife has been so accustomed to fashionable society," said the charitable
                  woman, apologetically, "that I should'nt wonder much if she did feel a little
                  ashamed to acknowledge me as her sister."</p>
               <p>"Ashamed of you!" exclaimed her husband, "why Henny, your warm sunny face makes
                  every body love you. Ashamed of my wife!" he repeated, going out of the door, "I
                  guess we'll see who'll be ashamed next week."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Lonny," he cried, as the little fellow ran across his path, "I've got
                  some news to tell you."</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7276-00000028"/>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said the boy, stopping before him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," repeated Joseph Atherton, laughing, "is that all the curiosity you
                  have? Aunt Henny and l are going to Clifton next week to a wedding; who do you
                  guess is to be married?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, sir," answered Lonny with a puzzled look.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe the boy knows what I mean no wonder, poor fellow; he hasn't lived
                  among folks but three months," and Mr. Atherton stroked Lonny's hair lovingly. "Do
                  you remember the kind lady that took care of you when your grandfather died, and
                  dressed you up so nicely?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, indeed," cried Lonny, brightening up, "and Nettie too."</p>
               <p>"Well, a very good man loves that lady, and is going to take her home with him, to
                  live in his beautiful house; so they have a wedding, and the minister prays, and
                  blesses them before they go; do you understand now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Lonny, and his eyes sparkled with joy—"and I know what I'll do
                  when I'm a man—I'll make—Oh, such a big house! And then <emph>I'll</emph> have a
                  wedding, and Nettie shall come and live with me."</p>
               <p>Uncle Joseph burst into a merry peal of laughter,—"I wish Mark's wife could hear
                  that," cried he; "many a stranger thing than that has happened, and I should like
                  to tell her so. Do you want to go with us, Lonny?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," was the prompt answer.</p>
               <p>"Why not, pray?" said Uncle Joseph with surprise.</p>
               <p>"I love to stay here best," said the happy little fellow.</p>
               <p>Lonny had an instinctive dread of the place where he had endured such suffering.
                  And what wonder that he shrank from leaving the Eden around him, within whose
                  walls love had first breathed upon his heart, transforming his dreary waste into a
                  paradise. Lonny could not forget the darkness which enshrouded his young life, and
                  this remembrance but intensified his happiness, and rendered deeper the gratitude
                  he cherished for his protectors.</p>
               <p>All was bustle and activity at Squire Atherton's. Invitations had been sent out,
                  far and near, for a social gathering at their house. It should be a splendid
                  party—so they both agreed—as several distinguished gentlemen from abroad would be
                  there. This was all Mrs. Atherton knew about it, as she gave her directions in
                  fine spirits, determined that for once, Clifton people should see what she was
                  capable of doing. Little did she dream what an event she was preparing to
                  celebrate. The lovers had guarded well their secret, so that no suspicion of the
                  truth entered her mind. Indeed, when Mr. Atherton remarked in a very quiet way,
                  once, that he thought Mr. Thornton would make Lottie a good husband, she replied
                  bitterly,—"Mr. Thornton has too much knowledge of the world to cast aside all the
                  brilliant matches waiting but his offer, and<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000029"/> marry one who spends most of her time in
                  poor-houses and hovels; nobody would ever have thought of such a preposterous
                  thing but yourself. Mr. Thornton, indeed! why, he's the very antipode of your
                  sister."</p>
               <p>Mr. Atherton smiled very complacently, as he thought of the surprise awaiting her,
                  and the complete refutation it would prove to her estimate of his sister's
                  worth.</p>
               <p>Swiftly passed the days and hours, as Lottie, with a glowing cheek and throbbing
                  heart, crossed each familiar threshold. Many a word of kindness and love, long
                  afterwards remembered; many a substantial token of sympathy, softly pressed into
                  the parting hand, marked her shining path. And when—the last act of duty
                  performed—she sought her silent chamber, not the magnificent trousseau—her
                  brother's generous gift, nor the pearls with which her lover thought fitly to
                  adorn her, filled her thoughts in that solemn hour. Alone, in His presence, where
                  oft she had found her daily strength, she knelt, and the heart's deep, sacred
                  communings, as she bowed there, none may know.</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Atherton in dismay, looking out of the
                  window,—"what can have sent Joseph and his wife here to-day—the very day of our
                  party! I never <emph>can</emph> endure the mortification of introducing them to
                  our guests."</p>
               <p>"Laws sakes, Miss Atherton," said Nurse Walton, who was there 'helping,' and who
                  overheard the remark, "'taint none o' my business, I spose, but I sh'd think you'd
                  be proud to show such nice relations to them whiskered looking furreners that come
                  here."</p>
               <p>"You can give your opinion when it is asked," haughtily replied Mrs. Atherton,
                  "but I will thank you to attend to your duties now."</p>
               <p>"Yes'm," said nurse, retreating; "but I know," she added in an under tone, "who's
                  got most to be ashamed on."</p>
               <p>"Seems to me you look quite fixed up here, Louisa," said Joseph, after they had
                  exchanged salutations, "what's going on now?"</p>
               <p>"We have invited some of our friends to visit us this evening, most
                  unfortunately," was the freezing reply.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you needn't be sorry on our account, Louisa," good-naturedly added he, "Henny
                  and I would like right well to see one of your grand parties; we're just in the
                  nick of time, ain't we, Henny?"—and his eye twinkled with fun.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you would like to go up stairs and rest yourself after your long ride,
                  Mrs. Atherton," said the lawyer's wife with cold politeness.</p>
               <p>"If you please, replied Henrietta, "but where is Lottie?"</p>
               <p>"In her room, I presume; I have not seen her today."</p>
               <p>A gentle knock at her door was immediately answered by Lottie, who greeted the new
                  comer with a warm welcome.</p>
               <p>"How kind you and Joseph are," said she, "to leave all your cares, and come here
                  just for my sake."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7276-00000030"/>
               <p>"Bless your dear heart," affectionately replied Henrietta, "we couldn't think of
                  staying away from your wedding; you can't think how strange it seems to me to have
                  you married. I do hope you will be happy in your choice."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, dear sister," said Lottie, blushing; "when you see Mr. Thornton you
                  will not doubt it."</p>
               <p>"What is this whim of Mark's, about the secrecy of your marriage?"</p>
               <p>"I don't quite understand it myself," said Lottie, "but you know his wife has some
                  peculiar views, and he hopes in this way to surprise her out of them."</p>
               <p>"I don't see how."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps by opening her eyes suddenly to the fact, that the 'Golden Rule' is not
                  always contemned by the higher classes."</p>
               <p>"Explain yourself, Lottie; I don't understand yet,—surely, the higher classes must
                  believe in the Bible," exclaimed the simple-hearted woman.</p>
               <p>"Not always," replied Lottie, smiling; "at least they don't believe in carrying
                  out its principles into practice. But when my blessed mother died," continued she,
                  going to her drawer, and taking from it a small parcel, "she left, as a dying
                  legacy to me, her youngest child, this rule of action, praying with her last
                  breath, that I might ever be guided by it."</p>
               <p>Tears trembled in Lottie's eyes, as she unfolded from its covering a delicate
                  frame, in which were enclosed, written in letters of gold, these words—</p>
               <p>"'WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM,'—A
                  dying mother's legacy."</p>
               <p>"And nobly have her children fulfilled their trust," said Henrietta, wiping away
                  the answering tears.</p>
               <p>"Mark's wife," pursued Lottie, "was brought up under very different influences;
                  she was always taught to regard the poor as an inferior class, to be treated but
                  little better than the beasts which labor for us. I think it is the fault of her
                  early education, rather than an error in heart, that her prejudices are so strong
                  towards those below her station."</p>
               <p>"Very likely," rejoined Henrietta; "but what has all that to do with this whim of
                  Mark's? I'm sure I don't see."</p>
               <p>"Why, you must know," smilingly replied Lottie, "that the little I have done—and
                  little indeed it is—for the alleviation of human misery, has destroyed my <hi
                     rend="i"/>caste with her, and, as she believes, with all the more refined
                  portion of society. So my good brother has an idea, that the <emph>shock</emph> of
                  seeing his humble sister honored with the hand of one of the most gifted in the
                  higher ranks, will at least disturb all her preconceived notions of
                  propriety."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm sure I hope it will," said Henrietta; "but is Mr. Thornton
                     <emph>really</emph> so great? I shall be almost afraid of him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he is great," said Lottie, laughing, "according to <emph>my</emph> ideas of
                  greatness; he has a heart large enough to embrace the whole human family, and a
                  hand ever open to the wants of the needy."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7276-00000031"/>
               <p>"Oh, Aunt Henny!" cried Nettie, bounding into the room, "I didn't know you was
                  here till just now,—I'm so glad to see you!" and she sprang into her lap with a
                  warm kiss of welcome.</p>
               <p>"How you have grown, you beauty," exclaimed Aunt Henny, clasping her arms about
                  her, "you blessed little darling."</p>
               <p>How those warm words, and the warmer clasp, sank into the child's heart. "Dear
                  Aunt Henny," said she caressingly, "how dearly I do love you, and Uncle Joseph
                  too; I'm so glad you've got Lonny to love you too."</p>
               <p>"Sure enough," exclaimed Lottie, "I had forgotten to ask about him."</p>
               <p>"He's the best little fellow you ever saw," said Henrietta, "and I really think he
                  loves us almost as well as if we were his own father and mother."</p>
               <p>"I dare say he does, quite as well," said Lottie; "you are the only parents he has
                  ever known; he will be a great blessing to you yet."</p>
               <p>"He is now," replied Henrietta warmly. "I wouldn't part with him for any
                  thing."</p>
               <p>Nettie's eyes sparkled with joy,—"Oh, aunty," cried she, "please tell mother how
                  good he is, and then maybe she'll let him be my cousin."</p>
               <p>"Not yet, dear," replied her aunt evasively, "wait till she sees him herself."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton, arrayed in costly robes, received with the air and manner of a
                  princess, the brilliant guests who, that evening, thronged her splendid
                  drawing-rooms. Every arrangement had been made in perfect accordance with her own
                  exquisite taste, and she flattered herself there was nothing to offend the nicest
                  connoisseur. She had studied for effect, and her labor was rewarded in the evident
                  admiration of her distinguished visitors. But for the ill-timed visit of Joseph
                  Atherton and his wife, whom, to her extreme mortification, she was obliged to
                  introduce as relatives, her satisfaction would have been complete. Lottie, she had
                  not even thought of, except to hope that some poor laborer's sick child might
                  require her presence that evening.</p>
               <p>"Where can Mr. Thornton be?" she asked her husband, as an hour passed, and he had
                  not made his appearance.</p>
               <p>"Sure enough, where is he?" repeated several ladies near her.</p>
               <p>"Don't give yourselves the least uneasiness about Mr. Thornton, ladies," said Mr.
                  Atherton, laughing; "he is doubtless wailing with all the patience of a Benedict,
                  his lady's pleasure."</p>
               <p>"What lady? who do you mean, Mr. Atherton?" said one.</p>
               <p>"What lady? why, the one he's engaged to, to be sure; he has promised to present
                  her here this evening."</p>
               <p>"Who is it? who is it? do tell us, Mr. Atherton," cried several in a breath, while
                  they crowded around him.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7276-00000032"/>
               <p>"Mr. Thornton might well feel flattered, to see the agitation his engagement
                  causes among such a bevy of beauties," said Mr. Atherton, withdrawing to his
                  wife's side.</p>
               <p>"Louisa," said he in a low voice, "whatever happens here to-night, control
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>Before his wife had time to reply, Mr. Atherton was at the farther end of the
                  room, conversing with the clergyman. In a few moments the door was thrown open,
                  and Melville Thornton entered, supporting on his arm a lady, clad in magnificent
                  bridal costume. The orange wreath and bridal veil concealed her features from Mrs.
                  Atherton, who advanced to greet the new comers with her usual stately air. It was
                  well her husband was at hand, to grasp her arm and whisper again—"Control
                  yourself." But for that, she must have fallen to the floor in her paralyzing
                  astonishment, as she saw Charlotte Atherton thus arrayed. The murmur of admiration
                  which ran around the room, as the fair, beautiful face of the bride was
                  recognized, recalled her to herself, and with ill-concealed chagrin, she
                  approached the couple.</p>
               <p>"You have really played off quite a game upon me," said she sneeringly, "pray,
                  allow me to congratulate you."</p>
               <p>"Louisa, Louisa," whispered her husband hurriedly, "remember where you are; I will
                  explain it all by and by."</p>
               <p>"Don't trouble yourself, sir," haughtily replied she, disengaging her arm, and
                  retreating to another part of the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atherton was nonplussed; he had expected his wife to be astonished, agitated
                  perhaps, but that she would so completely lose her self-possession, in the
                  presence of her guests, he never dreamed. Neither dreamed he of the bitter hatred
                  which then sprang up in her heart, towards the noble pair.</p>
               <p>"Shall we proceed?" asked the clergyman, in an embarrassed manner.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir," replied Mr. Atherton; "this little surprise which we planned for
                  my wife, has quite overcome her, as you see; but proceed, sir, at once, if you
                  please;"</p>
               <p>The few, simple words, so fraught with meaning to those whose destinies they thus
                  united, were soon spoken, and Melville Thornton received "Heaven's best gift" with
                  deep, earnest thankfulness. Nor, save in one heart, did a thought of the bride's
                  unworthiness mingle with the sincere congratulations bestowed on the happy pair.
                  Charlotte Atherton, the friend of the poor, was indeed worthy, as all hearts
                  acknowledged, the high and noble position of Melville Thornton's wife.</p>
               <p>"'Taint none O' my business, I 'spose," said old nurse, who had put her head in
                  unobserved at the door, "'taint none o' my business, but that is the blessedest
                  sight my old eyes ever sot on."</p>

               <p>LOOK, Melville," exclaimed his bride, as, at the close of a weary day's journey,
                  which completed their bridal tour, the carriage wound slowly along an avenue,
                  lined on either side with gracefully bending willows, "was there ever any thing
                  more beautiful? See what a triumphal arch those green boughs wave over our heads,
                  while their leaves are dancing in the sun's deep shadow like fairy life; and how
                  charmingly that elegant mansion looks, embowered in its sylvan home, and fanned by
                  those same graceful boughs. What can be more lovely!" added she, raising her eyes,
                  full of enthusiastic delight, to her husband.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> see something, this moment, that looks more lovely in my eyes," he
                  replied, affectionately pressing her hand; "but really, Willow Glen seems to give
                  us its brightest smile to-night; I never saw it look more charmingly."</p>
               <p>"Willow Glen! what an appropriate name for this beautiful retreat! Pray, who
                  resides there?" asked Lottie, as her eye ran delightedly over each new object in
                  the varying landscape.</p>
               <p>"I believe it is not occupied just now, though I'm told it will soon be," replied
                  her husband; "but I'm fearful my sweet wife will get so enchanted with this
                  Elysium, she will be disappointed in her own home," and his tone was just a little
                  reproachful.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed," cried Lottie, quickly withdrawing her gaze, "could I choose, it
                  would be a humbler home than that."</p>
               <p>"Why so, pray?" he asked with surprise.</p>
               <p>"Because, one must possess great riches to dwell there."</p>
               <p>"And wouldn't you like to possess great riches, Lottie?"</p>
               <p>"No, Melville; with riches come temptations and responsibilities, requiring more
                  grace than I fear is in my heart, to resist the one and sustain the other."</p>
               <p>"Well said, my little philosopher; but supposing riches should come to you without
                  your seeking, what then?"</p>
               <p>"Why, then, as a steward, I should strive to use them as would best please the
                  Lord of the treasury, earnestly praying, that with the gift, needed grace might be
                  bestowed."</p>
               <p>"Oh Lottie, I believe you are little less than an angel," exclaimed Melville
                  Thornton, with deep emotion.</p>
               <p>Just then the carriage, which had been gradually<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000034"/> approaching the house, stopped before the flight of
                  steps which led to the front entrance. Gayly leaping out, Mr. Thornton took his
                  wife's hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"Come, wife, we will get a better view of the place now; let's see how it looks
                  inside."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," said she, shrinking back into the carriage, "I have no curiosity that
                  would lead me to intrude into such a residence as this."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for that," he replied; "but just stop one moment, to please me, and we
                  will hasten on as soon as you choose."</p>
               <p>Thus appealed to, his wife hesitated no more, and taking his arm, they ascended
                  the steps to the door, in which stood a middle-aged woman, with a pleasant,
                  smiling countenance.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mrs. Dunn," said Mr. Thornton, shaking her hand cordially; "here you are,
                  faithful at your post. See what a treasure I have brought to cheer the old place!
                  This is my wife; and Lottie, dear, this is our excellent housekeeper, who has
                  lived under this roof since your husband was a boy. Come, now for some good warm
                  supper."</p>
               <p>No wonder Mrs. Dunn was astonished at the bewildered look, with which 'Mr.
                  Melville's' bride received her respectful salutation, without so much as answering
                  a word.</p>
               <p>"Come, Lottie," said he at length, with a cheerful laugh, "confess that I am as
                  good to plan a surprise as your brother Mark. Please walk into your own parlor,
                  and henceforth rule this house as best beseems you, its worthy, lovely
                  mistress."</p>
               <p>"Why, Melville! you surely do not mean"—she began.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do surely mean," he interrupted, "that Willow Glen, which, much to my
                  delight, you have been admiring the last half hour, is, with the heart of its
                  master, all your own. Now, Lottie, what say you to the 'humbler home?' do you
                  still 'choose' it?" he asked, smilingly.</p>
               <p>"The heart's home," she replied, "is ever where the loved one dwells. I had
                  pictured to myself a pleasant, rural cottage, where, in mutual confidence and
                  love, we should spend a tranquil, happy life; but I fear, Melville, you have not
                  chosen a fit mate for this gilded cage."</p>
               <p>"Birds of gay plumage, you know, Lottie, are not those of sweetest song. Would
                  that my '<emph>cage</emph>' were but worthy the gentle, beautiful mate I have
                  placed in it. But let us look around, wife, and see how nearly I have appreciated
                  your exquisite taste. Here is the boudoir, designed exclusively for yourself, with
                  all its useful and convenient appendages. Here, opening from it, the library,
                  where we may together spend many a happy hour with these silent voices. Then, for
                  our friends, whom we hope to welcome here, these rooms are fitted, as I thought
                  you would like to have them. Your delicate, womanly taste, will of course suggest
                  many improvements in all these arrangements, and I<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000035"/> beg you to remember that your wishes are to be the
                  guide of our happy home."</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, Melville," she rejoined, "say no more; I am already so overpowered with
                  astonishment, that I can find no words to express my feelings. Every thing is
                  perfect here—far too beautiful for your dowerless bride."</p>
               <p>"Dowerless," repeated he with emotion; "why, Lottie! no wife ever brought to her
                  husband's heart and home such a treasure as I have received in you."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it may prove so," she added earnestly.</p>
               <p>The old homestead to which Melville Thornton brought his bride, had been for
                  several years untenanted, save by the faithful housekeeper to whom we have been
                  introduced. Soon after the death of his father, in a fit of deep dejection,
                  Melville went abroad, simply telling his housekeeper to remain, and take care of
                  the place till his return, sooner, or later. As year after year passed, and no
                  tidings came from him, all, save Mrs. Dunn, predicted his untimely end; but she
                  pertinaciously averred her belief that 'Mr. Melville' would yet return, and spend
                  many happy years under the old roof. The event justified her expectations, as,
                  after an absence of nearly ten years, Melville Thornton suddenly appeared before
                  her. The darkening sun of warmer climes had browned his cheeks; the delicate
                  frame, which at twenty indicated fragility, had now swelled to the robust,
                  athletic form of maturity, and as the delighted housekeeper expressed it, "Mr.
                  Melville had grown to look just like them handsome furrinurs." The place had
                  changed too, in his absence. Uncultivated, save here and there a patch, the weeds
                  had luxuriated in their unbounded liberty, and over all the grounds, like a
                  weeping multitude, the willow spread its branches, sighing with each breeze for
                  the master's return. The mute welcome which their graceful boughs seemed to wave,
                  as at last he reached his home, suggested to Melville Thornton's grateful heart
                  the beautiful name he would hereafter give this lovely spot. So Willow Glen,
                  restored to more than its primitive beauty, under the artistic eye of its master,
                  became the abode of happiness, deep and lasting as were the worth and loveliness
                  of the bride he welcomed there.</p>
               <p>In her elegant home, surrounded with every luxury watchful love could devise,
                  Charlotte Thornton forgot not her life's great aim. In the hour of twilight, as
                  their first happy day drew to its close, she gently placed a little package in her
                  husband's hand, saying with a smile as she did so,</p>
               <p>"There, Melville, your wife, though dowerless, is not quite portionless; see what
                  a gift."</p>
               <p>"What is this!" he exclaimed, as his eyes rested on the golden letters, shimmering
                  in that dim light.</p>
               <p>"My mother's legacy," replied she, with deep emotion.</p>
               <p>"A noble legacy indeed," said he, gazing more earnestly at the glowing letters;
                  "this then is the secret of your faultless life."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Melville, call not a life so full of imperfection as<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000036"/> mine, faultless. Vainly do I strive to make this
                  golden rule the guide of my life. Its words daily condemn me. But now that I am so
                  strong in you," she added, with a look of confiding love, "I may yet hope to
                  redeem that sacred trust."</p>
               <p>"Together then, let us receive the golden legacy," said her husband, tenderly
                  clasping his arm about her, "and thus richly endowed, may our future lives be the
                  fulfilment of that sainted mother's prayers."</p>
               <p>Joy and gratitude commingled in the tears which the happy wife shed, as Mr.
                  Thornton reverently placed the frame in a conspicuous position in their elegantly
                  furnished drawing-room, and carefully covered it with a glass case.</p>
               <p>"There," said he, "let that be the talisman which shall open many a sealed heart,
                  and cause the blush of shame to mantle on the cheek of many a selfish and worldly
                  guest, who may enter these rooms."</p>
               <p>Joy, love, and peace, clasped hands over this noble consecration, and evermore
                  folded their wings beneath the charmed roof.</p>

               <p>"THEY do say," said Miss Pitkins to her next neighbor, at a meeting of the Ladies'
                  Benevolent Society, a few months after Melville Thornton's marriage, "they do say,
                  that Miss Thornton is a dreadful stuck-up thing."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the other, "and hadn't a cent to her back neither, when she came
                  there. Such people always do hold their heads higher'n anybody else, if they
                  happen to get a little money. For my part, I wouldn't take no notice of her if she
                  should come near me. I'd let her know that some folks was as good as others,"—and
                  Miss Tompkins gave her head a most significant toss.</p>
               <p>"Hadn't a cent!" repeated Miss Pitkins, with surprise, "why, what was that story
                  about her rich legacy?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, la! I know all about that," Miss Tompkins<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000037"/> replied with a consequential air; "'twas just
                  nothing at all."</p>
               <p>"Do tell us about it," cried several ladies, who had gathered around the speakers
                  to hear the news.</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, I got Dolly Martin her place there with the old housekeeper,
                  a-purpose so I could know something that's going on. So when Mr. Thornton brought
                  his wife home, I says to her, 'Dolly, keep your eyes and ears open,' and she did.
                  Well, the very first day, after Miss Thornton had been round and seen all the fine
                  things he bought for her, I s'pose she felt kind o' shamed, so she brings a nice
                  little bundle and gives it to him, telling him that's her legacy. Dolly says he
                  looked real pleased when he first opened it, and she could see through the
                  key-hole something shining just like gold; but pretty soon he said something to
                  Miss Thornton that made her cry, and then he got up and put it on the
                  mantel-shelf. Dolly didn't dare to stay any longer, for fear they would come out
                  and catch her, but she went in afterwards to see what it was."</p>
               <p>"Well, what was it?—what was it?" cried the eager listeners, as Miss Tompkins
                  suddenly stopped.</p>
               <p>"I would call this meeting to order," said the president, whose reproving glance
                  had silenced the loquacious spinster; "we have several items of business to be
                  disposed of, which may as well be done now. I should like to hear the opinion of
                  the ladies, as to the appropriation of our present funds, and also the object to
                  which we will devote our labors during the coming year. We have in the treasury
                  about seventy-five dollars, which, rightly used, may do much to advance the cause
                  we profess to love. The meeting is open for discussion on this point."</p>
               <p>"I hear," said Mrs. Robinson, the deacon's wife, "that we have many families in
                  town who, from sickness, hard times, and other causes, are suffering, in some
                  cases at least, for the necessaries of life. I think that sum, even doubled, or
                  trebled, would be well applied in relieving their wants."</p>
               <p>"This is a matter in which we are all equally interested," remarked the president
                  blandly; "we hope to hear from each of you."</p>
               <p>"It's my decided opinion," said Mrs. Wormwood, "that in a thriving place like
                  this, where work is plenty, there is no excuse for poverty like what Mrs. Robinson
                  speaks of. For my part, I go against encouraging idleness."</p>
               <p>"I thought we were at work-for the poor heathen," suggested Miss Pitkins; "I'm
                  sure I shouldn't have made so much effort to attend these meetings, if I hadn't
                  supposed so."</p>
               <p>"A box of clothing for the missionaries, I should like best," added Miss
                  Tompkins.</p>
               <p>"There seems to be such a division of opinion among you," said the chair, "that I
                  will venture to make a suggestion. I see our estimable pastor coming; why not
                  refer the whole matter to him? His judgment must surely be better than ours, for
                  his position gives him a comprehensive view of both home and foreign wants."</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7276-00000038"/>
               <p>This happy expedient was well received, and Rev. Mr. Flint, as he appeared, was at
                  once chosen their arbiter. Gray hairs and wrinkled brow, so oft the type of
                  wisdom, did but render more conspicuous and revolting the hard, restless eye, the
                  sinister mouth, and the whole contour of selfishness which bespoke the inner
                  nature of this professed man of God. Dollars and cents was the gauge of men's
                  souls in his estimation—money the only evidence of worth! Alas! that among the
                  holy brotherhood of God's ministering servants, even one such should be found,—one
                  whose sheep's clothing could not conceal the wolf beneath. All honor would we
                  render to that noble class of self-denying men, who shrink not from the call of
                  their Master, though earthly reward pertain not to his service. But when some
                  ministerial Judas turns the house of God into a temple of money-changers, sharp
                  indeed should be the scourge-which should drive him thence.</p>
               <p>Naturally enough, the people under Rev. Mr. Flint's charge, with here and there a
                  noble exception, had partaken somewhat of his nature. External religious forms
                  were most scrupulously observed, but the gentle, peaceable fruits of the Spirit
                  were fearfully wanting.</p>
               <p>But while we are thus digressing, eager faces are looking to their pastor for his
                  decision. His worthy coadjutor, the <emph>very</emph> devoted president, is "sure
                  his extensive knowledge and sound judgment will render it easy for him to point
                  out at once the fittest object for their benevolence."</p>
               <p>Rolling his tongue hi the peculiar manner he was wont to do when pleased, he
                  "thanked the president for her compliment, and would only say, that he considered
                  the ladies present fully competent to decide their own case."</p>
               <p>"Do you not think," asked Mrs. Robinson, "that we should take care of the poor
                  among us, before we send our charities abroad?"</p>
               <p>"Not always," replied Mr. Flint; "there is much danger in helping our poor
                  neighbors, lest we learn them to depend on us, instead of trying to help
                  themselves."</p>
               <p>"That's just what <emph>I</emph> said," chimed in Mrs. Wormwood; "folks haint any
                  business to be poor here, where they can get work."</p>
               <p>"Work <emph>is</emph> plenty, to be sure," said Miss Priscilla Page, with a
                  significant glance at the last speaker; "pity the <emph>pay</emph> wasn't plenty
                  too."</p>
               <p>"I would beg the ladies' attention to the subject under discussion," remarked the
                  chair; "Mr. Flint has not yet given us his opinion, which I hope he will do
                  freely."</p>
               <p>"As you have called upon me most unexpectedly, ladies, to advise you in this
                  matter," said Mr. Flint, rising very deliberately, "it would be natural for me to
                  mention the subject which, just at this time, interests me most. Our society—and I
                  say it without boasting—has become one of the largest, wealthiest, and most
                  influential in all the State. It becomes us, therefore, to send a good name
                  abroad, by the liberality with which we enter into the spirit of the great reforms
                  of the day.<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7276-00000039"/> Among these reforms, none
                  seems to me so important as a union of the two continents, in one great 'Society
                  for evangelizing the world.' Such a society, you know, exists, and in its councils
                  are found some of the greatest men of the age. One hundred dollars would
                  constitute your pastor a life-director in this society, and give you a name and
                  influence in its councils. I merely mention this subject for your consideration,
                  as we are apt to forget the duties we owe the world, and confine ourselves to a
                  narrow circle of benevolence."</p>
               <p>Here Mr. Flint took his seat, with an air of profound humility.</p>
               <p>"You have heard the very excellent remarks of our pastor," said the president; "I
                  hope it will enlarge our views of duty. Will you take any action on this
                  subject?"</p>
               <p>"I move," said Mrs. Wormwood, "that we contribute one hundred dollars to this
                  great object Mr. Flint has explained to us, to constitute him a
                  life-director."</p>
               <p>The motion was seconded, and carried without any opposition, save that expressed
                  by indignant looks and motionless hands.</p>
               <p>"Really, ladies," said Mr. Flint, again rising, "your liberality is praiseworthy.
                  In the name and behalf of the noble society you have honored by your generous
                  vote, I tender you my sincere thanks. Your testimony of respect for myself will
                  receive a more public acknowledgment."</p>
               <p>"Yes," muttered Miss Priscilla, in an under tone, "I 'spose it will be trumpeted
                  all over creation, how very benevolent we are, while these poor folks around us
                  are dying from neglect."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miss Tompkins," whispered a young lady, "I am dying to know what that legacy
                  was of Mrs. Thornton's; do tell me now, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, yes, tell us all now," said another, as a knot of ladies gathered around
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, 'twas nothing but just a little brass frame, with a verse from the Bible in
                  it, made of brass letters," replied Miss Tompkins, contemptuously.</p>
               <p>"Well, that was mean!" "Who ever heard any thing like it?" "What impudence!" "I
                  don't wonder he was angry!"—these and many other similar expressions burst from
                  the indignant ladies, as Miss Tompkins concluded her information.</p>
               <p>"One side of a story is good till t'other's told," cried Miss Priscilla, who had
                  heard the whole thing; "and as this is a benevolent society, got up for the
                  benefit of our fellow-creaturs, it wouldn't do no harm to tell the t'other side
                  right here, let it hit where it will."</p>
               <p>"Oh, by all means, let's have your story, Miss Priscilla," was the universal
                  exclamation, amid cries of "order" from the president.</p>
               <p>"I don't want to make no disorder," said she, turning to the president; "but if
                  they'll all listen quietly, I'll tell the story as I heard it; and may be some of
                  you'll find coats to fit: if you do, why put 'em on, that's all."</p>
               <p>By this time eyes and ears were all open; for Miss<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000040"/> Priscilla, an odd, quaint little body, had a way of
                  saying things, that was perfectly irresistible to all but the immediate subjects
                  of her sarcastic tongue.</p>
               <p>"Well," said she, "as you all seem to be listening, I'll begin with what I see
                  myself. I didn't get no Dolly Martins to peak through the key-hole for me, 'cause,
                  you see, news that comes <emph>that</emph> way, has to be made all over after it
                  squeezes through; and I don't like mine second hand, no how. So, as I was saying,
                  I'll begin with what I see; and if any on you want to know what true benevolence
                  is, you'll find out, I guess, before I get through. Well, a couple o' months ago,
                  I should think, as I was coming home from my sister Sally's, over the fields, I
                  took a notion to go down the lane where old Miss Fletcher lives, who's been sickly
                  all along, you know, and so I went right into see her without knocking. When I got
                  inside the door, I stood stock-still in perfect wonder; for there was her old
                  room, fixed up as nice as could be—real white curtains and bedspread—a piece of
                  carpet on the floor, and clean, nice dishes on her stand. And then the old lady
                  herself looked so comfortable in her white night-cap and gown, I thought some
                  fairy must have been there and done it all. But right close beside her bed sat one
                  of the sweetest looking ladies you ever see; they didn't neither of 'em see me, so
                  I kept still, and the lady read away in the Bible; and then she kneeled down and
                  prayed—Oh, so beautifully! I didn't wonder a bit that the tears trickled down the
                  sick woman's cheek, for I couldn't keep from crying myself. When she'd done, I
                  slipped out as still as I went in, for I felt like an intruder there; and on my
                  way home who should I meet but Polly Bemis, who was bedrid for I don't know how
                  long. 'What on earth has set you on your feet again, Polly!' says I. 'I never was
                  so amazed in all my life.' 'Well you may be,' says Polly, says she, 'for I'm
                  amazed at myself; but come into my house, and I'll tell you all about it.' When we
                  got in and sot down—'There, Priscilla,' says she, 'did you ever see a nicer
                  room—bran-new stove, and wood enough in the cellar to burn all winter—this new
                  rocking-chair, and that nice bit of carpet; and what's better'n all, here am I,
                  able to walk about and earn my own living! Who do you think has done all this?' 'I
                  guess,' said I, 'may be the Benevolent Society's been helping on ye.' 'No, not a
                  bit of it,' says she; 'I might a' been lying on that bed now for all they'd a'
                  done for me; 'tain't their kind o' benevolence to help such as me.' 'Well, do tell
                  me who it was,' said I, growing impatient. ''Twan't nobody more nor less than
                  Squire Thornton's new wife,' says Polly, says she. 'She found out how I was, and
                  then she went and got something to cure me; and every day she come here herself to
                  see how I got along, and brought me all these things; and when I got better, she
                  gave me sewing to do, so as I should feel independent, she said.' I never was so
                  beat in all my life, and I told Polly so. 'Oh, well,' says Polly, says she, 'if
                  you'd known half she's done among the poor folks here, you'd be astonished; but
                  she has such a still way with her, nobody but those she helps knows<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000041"/> any thing about it.' Just that minute somebody
                  knocked at the door, and in walked the very lady I saw at Miss Fletcher's. 'Good
                  morning, Miss Bemis,' said she, 'how do you find yourself to-day?' 'Nicely—many
                  thanks to you, Miss Thornton,' said Polly. 'Oh, no, not to me are your thanks
                  due,' said the lady, with a sweet smile, 'but to Him who has restored your
                  health.' And then she sat down, and talked like a saint to us both. I'd heard this
                  very story you've been telling about her, Miss Tompkins, and I couldn't hardly
                  believe my eyes and ears when I saw her; but I meant to find out the truth about
                  it; so when she went away, I jest followed her out, and she asked me to walk home
                  with her. I told her I should like to, if only for one thing. 'And what is that,
                  pray?' said she. 'To see the curious legacy I've heard so much about,' said I; 'I
                  s'pose you'd have no objections to show it to me.' 'You mean my mother's legacy, I
                  suppose,' said she; 'I don't know what you have heard about it; but come with me,
                  and I shall be most happy to show it to you.' And then, as we walked along, she
                  told me what a good, pious mother she had,—how she tried to impress upon her
                  children's minds the great object for which they should live—that the world might
                  be better for their having lived in it. She wan't one mite stuck up, Miss Pitkins,
                  'cause when we got to her house, she axed me right into her grand parlor, and told
                  me to sit right down in the best seat there was. I felt dreadful shamed when Mr.
                  Thornton come into the room, and she told him what I'd come for; but he looked
                  real pleased. 'That legacy, Miss Priscilla,' said he, 'is worth coming miles to
                  see. If my wife had brought millions of gold to me, I should not have prized it as
                  I do this little talisman, which has made so many hearts leap for joy, and changed
                  so many abodes of misery into happy homes. The world has but few such gems, Miss
                  Priscilla,' said he, as he took down from the mantel-shelf a small frame of solid
                  gold, and handed it to me, 'and fewer still are they, whose lives are guided by
                  these words, which shall usher in the earth's millennium.' I didn't know what to
                  say, he talked so beautiful; but I made up my mind that that legacy was goin' to
                  do more for poor people round here than all our benevolent societies
                  together."</p>
               <p>"But you haven't told us what the legacy was yet," said several.</p>
               <p>"I told you that Mr. Thornton showed me a frame of solid gold:—well, in this frame
                  were these words, all written in solid gold, too,—I wish you would all attend,
                  'cause I'm afraid <emph>our</emph> golden rules have been made of lead, or
                  somethin' worse,—this was it:—'WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU,
                  DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM.' Did you ever hear those words before, Mr. Flint?" asked
                  the spinster, with a mischievous look.</p>
               <p>"You are very facetious, Miss Page," replied he, "I presume we have them graven on
                  all our hearts."</p>
               <p>"When you voted, just now, to let our poor folks suffer and die in their poverty,
                  and send such a lot of money to a rich society, jest to buy us a great name, I<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7276-00000042"/> didn't see how we could reconcile it with
                  such a rule," said Miss Priscilla.</p>
               <p>"Oh, fie! for shame, Miss Priscilla!" exclaimed several voices, while the
                  sanctimonious president looked with holy horror upon the audacious speaker.</p>
               <p>"You take a very narrow view, you must allow me to say, Miss Priscilla, of the
                  vast system of benevolence that rule enjoins," said Mr. Flint, with feeling; "but
                  we pardon the allusion in consideration of your ignorance of these matters. Shall
                  we close this meeting?" he continued, addressing the president.</p>
               <p>What but cold, solemn mockery, to Him whose bosom glows with sympathetic love for
                  the suffering child of poverty, were the words of this world-hardened,
                  money-loving, professed disciple, as he besought a blessing upon their
                     <emph>benevolent</emph> operations.</p>
               <p>Would that from imagination only this picture were drawn; but, alas for human
                  nature, even here <emph>truth</emph> is stranger than fiction!</p>

               <p>THANKSGIVING! how the golden chords of memory vibrate with the joyous echo! how,
                  in the long vista of departed years, we see our path thickly studded with these
                  bright oases, drawing nearer and nearer together, in defiance of all laws of
                  perspective, as they approach the foreground of life's great picture!</p>
               <p>Thanksgiving! how, as with a conjurer's touch, does the bright fire gleam upon us;
                  loving, familiar voices greet our ear, and all the glad surroundings of feasting
                  and mirth burst upon our vision, as we breathe that word! How do hearts which
                  ne'er grow old, beneath the silver crown of years, seem radiant with the dew of
                  youth, as in these happy reunions, sire and<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7276-00000043"
                  /> grandsire mingle with their little flock in the festive scenes!</p>
               <p>But thanksgiving at Daisyside was no mere family gathering. Dearly as Joseph
                  Atherton loved to draw around him the familiar faces of his kindred, there was
                  something which gave to his noble heart, deeper, more enduring joy. He loved,
                  better than aught else, to raise the sinking heart, cheer the drooping spirit, and
                  cause the eye, dimmed with misery's tear, upward to cast its look of hopeful
                  trust. And when the yearly jubilee came round, which called to each household
                  hearth its happy band, then were the homeless and friendless made to feel, that at
                  his board they were feasting with an elder brother.</p>
               <p>"But thanksgiving at Daisyside should be celebrated this year as it had never
                  been," said the grateful farmer, as he viewed the rich harvest of his toils—barns
                  and storehouses overflowing with plenty.</p>
               <p>"And then there is another reason," added his wife, as Lonny, in the gladness of a
                  freed spirit, bounded towards them.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Joseph Atherton; "and do you know, I more than half believe we are
                  entertaining an angel unawares, in that boy. Why, <emph>every</emph> thing has
                  gone right with me since he came,—not a cross, or perplexity, that I can think of,
                  to mar our prosperity and "happiness."</p>
               <p>Again that low, pleasant laugh, as Henrietta replied, "It's only because you
                     <emph>wont</emph> see trouble any where. But," she continued, fondly caressing
                  the boy, "Lonny<emph>is</emph> a treasure, and he shall see what a thanksgiving
                  we'll make for him. Now, what do you want most of any thing in the world,
                  Lonny?"</p>
               <p>Had this question been put to the boy a year ago, he could quickly have
                  answered—"Food and raiment, and friends to love me;" but now that these were his
                  in abundance, he only looked up wonderingly as he answered, "Nothing."</p>
               <p>"Nothing?" repeated she, while a bright smile shone upon her face, "have we then
                  so nearly satisfied this young heart? But think again, Lonny, isn't there any body
                  you want to see?"</p>
               <p>Again the little face was raised to hers,—"No, ma'am, unless Nettie would come
                  here to see me."</p>
               <p>"And what if she would?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, then I should be so glad!" cried Lonny, clapping his hands.</p>
               <p>"Don't you understand, wife?" said Joseph, laughing, "he doesn't want any thing
                  that'll take him away from here."</p>
               <p>"Bless his heart, he shan't go away from here while I live. Daisyside would be
                  dreadful lonely without him now." And the warm-hearted woman clasped the happy boy
                  affectionately to her heart.</p>
               <p>"Take care, wife, you mustn't forget that you were well enough contented with
                  Daisyside before this little fellow came," said her husband, throwing his arms
                  about them both, as he brushed a tear from his eye.</p>
               <p>"You love him as well as I do," was her quiet smiling rejoinder.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7276-00000044"/>
               <p>"To be sure I do, wife; we've got ten years of love to make up to him, and I mean
                  to do my share of it. But what has this all to do with thanksgiving?"</p>
               <p>"Much, every way, I think; at least I shall be mistaken if we do not find deeper
                  cause of thankfulness in our hearts than ever."</p>
               <p>"Why, to be sure," said Joseph, "and therefore I'm determined to have a grand time
                  of it. Let's see—Nettie shall be here, that's certain; and Mark, with his proud
                  wife and boy; and Lottie, with her lucky husband; and what's more'n all, I'm going
                  to have my old nurse too. Mark 'll like that, I know."</p>
               <p>"What! Nurse Walton? Why Joseph! Mark's wife would think you was crazy."</p>
               <p>"Let her think then; she'll see worse things than that if she comes to our
                  thanksgiving."</p>
               <p>"But what if she refuses to come, when she knows who you've invited?"</p>
               <p>"Let her stay away, then. I wouldn't have her here if it wasn't for Mark, any
                  more'n I'd throw a great black snake into a nest of chickens. I know what I'll do;
                  I'll write to Mark, and let him manage it for us; but have old nurse I must."</p>
               <p>Since the first ebullition of feeling, at what she termed the insult offered her
                  in her own house, Mrs. Mark Atherton had never alluded to the marriage, or even
                  existence of her husband's sister. The relief she experienced in being rid of an
                  example so repugnant to her proud heart, and, as she deemed it, so fraught with
                  danger to her children, lessened somewhat the mortification she felt at the ruse.
                  Peace had pervaded her household; but it was that peace whose calm surface did but
                  hide the turbid waters beneath; into which, if but a ripple came, forth would
                  spring its bitter founts. Something of this Mark Atherton feared, and when his
                  brother's letter came, filled with genial warmth, sincere and hearty in its tone,
                  he looked to his wife, not without misgivings, for her assent to the cordial
                  invitation. The haughty, curling lip, and scornful smile, with which she received
                  the message, told but too well the bitterness her heart still cherished.</p>
               <p>"Thanksgiving at Joseph Atherton's!" she exclaimed, sneeringly, " I've no fancy
                  for such poor-house festivals. They'll do for him, now, with his pauper child, but
                  he needn't expect us to share his degradation, any farther than our relationship
                  forces us to."</p>
               <p>"Joseph has not degraded himself," mildly replied her husband; "no man in T—— has
                  a better reputation than my brother."</p>
               <p>"You and I can never think alike about such things," said she, "we were brought up
                  very differently."</p>
               <p>"Well, we won't discuss them now," he added, "as we must decide upon an answer to
                  this letter. Will you go, Louisa?"</p>
               <p>Hard indeed must have been the heart, impervious the breast, that could withstand
                  the tone of gentle entreaty with which this was uttered. But Mrs. Atherton
                  unhesitatingly answered, "No, I will not."</p>
               <p>For a moment Mr. Atherton's head dropped upon<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000045"/> his hand; then with a mild, but resolute voice, he
                  spoke,—"I must go without you then, Louisa."</p>
               <p>"You can do as you please," was her freezing reply, "I never presume to control
                  your movements."</p>
               <p>"Have the children ready then, for we shall leave on Wednesday morning."</p>
               <p>"The children will not go, Mr. Atherton," said she quickly; "they shall not be
                  contaminated with those vile people."</p>
               <p>"The children <emph>will</emph> go, Mrs. Atherton," exclaimed her husband, with a
                  decision that was not to be questioned.</p>
               <p>Thanksgiving at Daisyside! Why should not the poor in spirit rejoice as the glad
                  sound echoed from lip to lip, and from heart to heart; for then, over their dark
                  path of weariness and woe, beamed the soft radiance of a heavenly light. Then,
                  through each lonely heart, stole the sweet, gentle breathings of sympathy and
                  love, strengthening its weary future with the foretaste of a bright hereafter. How
                  many happy souls, redeemed from the sin and misery of an unblessed existence here,
                  will louder tune their notes of joy, as in their bright robes they welcome
                     <emph>home</emph> him who first pointed their way thither, smoothing the rugged
                  path over which their Master called them to their reward! Blessed indeed were the
                  noble hearts at Daisyside, for many had they thus guided onward.</p>
               <p>A carriage slowly ascended the hill. Its approach, however, had been telegraphed
                  through the house, and eager faces were bending forward to catch the first glimpse
                  of its inmates.</p>
               <p>"It's Mark," said Joseph Atherton, rubbing his hands delightedly.</p>
               <p>"There's Nettie—I see her! Oh dear, dear, how glad I be!" cried Lonny, jumping up
                  and down in his joy.</p>
               <p>"I wonder if Mark's wife has come," said Henrietta, shading her eyes with her hand
                  to see more clearly. "I'm sure 'twould be very kind in her to take so much
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! Henny, 'twould be a great deal kinder of her to stay away; but there she
                  is, on the back seat, and my goodness! if there aint old nurse right side of her!
                  Well done, Mark!" and Joseph's hearty laugh reached the ears of his visitors.</p>
               <p>"There's a welcome for you," exclaimed Mark Atherton, his face beaming with
                  pleasure, "just such an one as I love."</p>
               <p>"Laws sake!" said Nurse Walton, forgetting the silence she had felt constrained to
                  keep during their ride, "Joe allers was just so cheery like,—'taint none o' my
                  business I s'pose, but I wish there was lots more o' jest such in the world. But,
                  laws sake! do look at that boy standin' side o' his wife,—'taint possible that's
                  the child he tuk?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's Lonny," cried Nettie, in happy unconsciousness of the frown gathering
                  on her mother's face;—"don't he look pretty? prettier than Ally, I think."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lennette,</emph>" and the voice made the child start and<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000046"/> tremble, "haven't I told you how to treat that boy?
                  Remember, or it will be your last visit to your uncle's."</p>
               <p>"Laws sake! Miss Atherton, what hurt can it do Nettie to play with such a nice
                  pretty boy?"</p>
               <p>"I am capable of taking care of my own family, Mrs. Walton," replied the haughty
                  lady, as the carriage drew up before the door.</p>
               <p>"Now Mark, this is really kind in you," said his brother, as he warmly welcomed
                  his visitors.</p>
               <p>"I am sure we ought to be very much obliged to you for coming so far to see us,"
                  Henrietta added, as she conducted them into the house.</p>
               <p>"I came on my children's account," was Mrs. Atherton's freezing reply.</p>
               <p>"Dear little things! well, I am sure I hope they will have a good time,
                  thanksgiving. Lonny has got ever so many things to show them."</p>
               <p>Unlucky speech. Kind, simple-hearted woman!</p>
               <p>"I wish it understood once for all, and I may as well say it now,"—and Mrs.
                  Atherton drew herself up with a commanding gesture as she spoke—"I have no
                  sympathy with the low task you have undertaken, in attempting to raise that pauper
                  foundling above his station, and I have forbidden my children any intercourse
                  whatever with him. So you will oblige me, and prevent unpleasant consequences, by
                  remembering this injunction."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm sure,"—Henrietta began, and then stopped in her confusion.</p>
               <p>"'Taint no business o' mine I s'pose, but I sh'd think, Miss Atherton, you'd 'a
                  kep your children to home if that's the way you mean to manage, 'cause children
                  play together as nat'ral as kittens, and you can't keep 'em apart nohow,"—and old
                  nurse nodded her head, as much as to say, "and I don't mean to either."</p>
               <p>A scornful look was the only reply Mrs. Atherton deigned to give; but Albert, who
                  had hitherto been silent and dogged, stepped towards her with an insolent air,—"I
                  guess my mother knows what's right," said he; "you won't catch boys like me
                  playing with beggars,"—and he pointed with a sneer toward the unoffending boy, who
                  was the cause of this outbreak.</p>
               <p>Nettie's little bosom heaved, and her blue eyes flashed indignantly at the
                  unfeeling words and actions of her brother, but seeing her father just entering
                  the room, she sprang with a quick revulsion of feeling into his arms, sobbing,—"It
                  is too bad, isn't it father?"</p>
               <p>"What's too bad, my love?" asked he anxiously, as he kissed her wet cheek,—"what
                  makes you cry?" Then as he glanced around the group he added,—"Something has
                  disturbed you all; what has occurred?"</p>
               <p>Uncle Joseph's pleasant voice prevented a reply, as he entered, and with another
                  hearty welcome greeted his guests, especially kind old Nurse Walton.</p>
               <p>"Now we'll have a right good thanksgiving of it," said he joyfully, not seeing, or
                  not wishing to see the cloud over their spirits,—"I expect Lottie and her grand
                  husband every minute, and how pleased she'll be to find you all here."</p>
               <p>Uncle Joseph's genial humor, irresistible as the<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000047"/> sun's light and warmth, soon restored cheerfulness
                  to the circle; but in two young hearts the impressions of that hour were
                  ineffaceably stamped. The <emph>mother's</emph> throne in the heart of her child
                  began then to totter. Woe! woe to that mother, if she chain not the demons which
                  will ere long crush it to the earth!—Injustice and cruelty! Nettie—sweet,
                  confiding, affectionate child that she was, could see it, feel it, and read it too
                  in that mother's eye, with the quick instinct of a true, though childish
                  heart.</p>
               <p>And the orphan, whose years had been matured by early sorrow, how those heartless
                  taunts woke the old, bitter spirit within him, and made him feel that his new
                  world was not all brightness and joy. Quietly he stole away into the granary,
                  where a half hour later his kind guardian found him in tears.</p>
               <p>"Heydey, my boy!" exclaimed he cheerfully, "what's all this? crying, when Nettie's
                  come? I thought you was going to be ever so happy."</p>
               <p>"What is a 'pauper foundling,' Uncle Joseph?" asked Lonny, wiping his eyes, "and
                  why don't Nettie's mother, want her to play with me? Am I a bad boy?"</p>
               <p>"You a bad boy! that's what you aint, Lonny. Who put such notions into your head?
                  Pauper foundling! who said that?" asked Uncle Joseph, rather sharply.</p>
               <p>"Why, Nettie's mother said she mustn't play with me, 'cause I'm a 'pauper
                  foundling.' I'm sure that means something bad, or she wouldn't have looked at me
                  so cross, nor Ally neither,"—and the tears began to flow again.</p>
               <p>"O, my goodness! if I wouldn't like to train that Jezebel once," exclaimed Joseph
                  Atherton, now thoroughly angry;—"did she say such a thing before you? You just
                  tell Mrs. Mark Atherton, and every body else, that you are Joseph Atherton's boy,
                  and he'll see that you are treated well, and play with any body you like to. So
                  wipe your eyes, Lonny, and be as smart as any of 'em; I'll take care of you; and
                  remember, you're the best boy Uncle Joe knows."</p>
               <p>Hope's light flashed again into the boy's heart; but the sting of those barbed
                  words cannot be easily removed.</p>
               <p>"This is your ideal of a Thanksgiving dinner, is it, Lottie?" said Melville
                  Thornton, as, standing at the end of a long table, they gazed upon the busy scene
                  before them. Busy indeed! where hearts and voices kept tune to the musical clatter
                  of knives and plates.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and if I may judge from your looks, Melville, you do not disagree with me,"
                  replied his wife smilingly.</p>
               <p>"No, Lottie, I do not; I am charmed with your brother's mode of spending
                  Thanksgiving. Why, I should be prouder far to preside over such a table in my own
                  house, than to see it filled with aristocratic elegance. I don't wonder that
                  Joseph and his wife look so happy to-day; this is something to live for;" and as
                  he spoke, Mr. Thornton's eye glanced rapidly from face to face, reading everywhere
                  the happy content of<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7276-00000048"/> grateful hearts. One
                  little face seemed strangely familiar to him; and as it turned towards him, and a
                  pair of dark eyes met his, he exclaimed, "What child is that, Lottie! do you
                  know?</p>
               <p>"What! that little fellow looking so earnestly at you?" said his wife. "Why, that
                  is the child brother Joseph has adopted. Isn't he a beauty?—poor fellow, he never
                  spent such a day as this before."</p>
               <p>"He interests me strangely, wife; where did your brother find him?</p>
               <p>"His grandfather died in Clifton, in most destitute circumstances; and to save him
                  from the poor-house, Joseph took him home. Wasn't he kind?"</p>
               <p>"Very; but had he no parents?"</p>
               <p>"From all I could gather, his birth was involved in mystery, if not shame; but I
                  would not say that, even to brother Joseph."</p>
               <p>"Very considerate in you, Lottie. I hope the poor boy will never know his
                  degradation; he is certainly a most interesting child, and he could not be placed
                  in better hands than Joseph's. But come, my heart warms towards these happy
                  people; let's mingle in their pleasures."</p>
               <p>"What a consummate fool your brother-in-law makes of himself to please his
                  whimsical wife!"</p>
               <p>Such was Mrs. Mark Atherton's exclamation, as Melville Thornton, with Nurse Walton
                  on his arm, shook hands and chatted gayly with each of these, as she termed them,
                  "world's outcasts."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you'll find yourself in the minority here, Louisa isa," replied her husband
                  cheerfully; "so you'd better give in. Come, Ally and Nettie, let's go and play
                  blindman's-buff with those children;" and before the mother's outstretched arm
                  could prevent, they were merrily frolicking with the proscribed race.</p>
               <p>How must the recording angel, as his glowing pen swiftly transcribes the pure,
                  unselfish joy of this scene,—how must he pause, ere he can trace the chill
                  breathings of that worldly mother's heart! Alas! the fearful record is made, which
                  tears nor penitence <emph>alone</emph> can ever erase.</p>
               <p>Thanksgiving! Look at Joseph Atherton's happy face, beaming with the honest pride
                  of a noble deed; or at the cheerful groups of those who, from cottage, hut, and
                  by-ways, have been bidden to this feast of love,—not with the cold charity which
                  says to its hungry brother, "eat and be satisfied," but with the tenderness which
                  to the lonely heart whispers,—"Thou art my brother, thou my sister; come to the
                  family-feast, and for once forget thy sorrows." Look at the refined and elegant
                  Melville Thornton, whose words of cheerful hope and sympathy fall like heavenly
                  dew upon those thirsty souls, reflecting in his own heart a joy which angels well
                  may covet. Look, too, at the fair and happy one, whose busy hands have prepared
                  this banquet, more honored than if kings and princes had been her guests. See
                  hope's glad light kindling every eye, and Heaven's blessing warming each heart;
                  and say, can aught on earth give deeper significance to the word, than "<hi

               <p>FATHER TIME, as onward he pressed with rapid strides, gently laid the soft,
                  silvery lines of care on familiar brows, while with his delicate pencillings he
                  matured, and beautified the forms of childish innocence and grace. Ten times had
                  he, in his yearly round, greeted those whom we left at Joseph Atherton's festive
                  board; and at each new greeting his magic touch spanned the bright bow of peace
                  over the good and pure, while it deepened the shadows on the worldling's path.</p>
               <p>Ten years thus had passed since the events in our last chapter, when the gallant
                  ship Neptune, gently cradling her precious burden, glided swiftly over the
                  trackless ocean to her destined port. Like a thing of light she flew, her white
                  wings outspread, as if to guard the sacred trust committed to her, anon riding in
                  triumph the towering wave, or proudly measuring its depths,—on she sped, like a
                  messenger of hope.</p>
               <p>In one of the state-rooms, furnished with unusual elegance, reclined a beautiful
                  maiden, unheeding the strife of the elements without, save when a sudden lurch of
                  the vessel caused an exclamation of fear from her companion; then, with a merry
                  laugh, the fair girl would "wonder if they should ever find themselves right side
                  up again."</p>
               <p>Lucille Mowbray had been left at an early age, under the care and guidance of a
                  maiden aunt, the sister, and only surviving relative of Lucille's father. Of her
                  mother's family little had been known, as Mr. Mowbray transplanted from her
                  American home his meek, gentle, and lovely wife, only to smile upon him two short
                  years, ere she was laid in the tomb of his fathers. Miss Mowbray watched with all
                  a mother's care and tenderness over the little charge thus left to her, and when
                  the doors of that last resting-place were again opened, and Mr. Mowbray laid
                  beside his angel wife, she drew the orphan child closer to her breast, and
                  earnestly vowed that no other tie should ever bind her to this earth. Well had she
                  fulfilled her trust, ere death led her, too, into his silent chambers, and left
                  Lucille sole survivor of her father's race.</p>
               <p>The heiress of the Mowbrays, with almost unlimited wealth at her command, had been
                  taught to view aright the deceitful smiles of the world, and she turned from its
                  adulation with a heart yearning for kindred and<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000050"/> friends. Suddenly a new thought took possession of
                  her,—there might yet be some in whose veins flowed her mother's gentle blood. With
                  a beating heart, she unlocked the escrutoire in which her father's private papers
                  had been carefully kept, and finding there the clue she sought, her happy
                  imagination o'erleaped all boundaries, and revelled in its bright anticipations of
                  unselfish love.</p>
               <p>Ah, Lucille! the broad Atlantic, on whose bosom you so confidingly rest, as with
                  her deep-toned lullaby she soothes your unquiet heart, is not more fathomless than
                  are the dark passions of the world whither you are hastening. Heaven defend thee
                  from the fearful mlstroom!</p>
               <p>"Now, Maggie," laughingly exclaimed the heiress, springing from her recumbent
                  position, "I've caught you dreaming,—there you've been sitting the last half hour
                  with a book before your eyes, but never a word do you know of its contents, I'll
                  venture; pray, what <emph>can</emph> employ your thoughts so intently."</p>
               <p>Margaret Singleton raised her eyes, full of tenderness, to her beautiful
                  companion,—"I was thinking of you, Lucille," said she.</p>
               <p>"And what of me, dear Maggie?" asked Lucille, affectionately clasping her
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"First, I was thinking of the surprise and regret your absence from Mowbray Hall
                  would occasion a certain gentleman I could name, and then"—</p>
               <p>"If you mean young Lord Hastings, Maggie," interrupted Lucille, "his surprise, or
                  regret, are equally indifferent to me. He is selfish, Maggie,—it is the
                     <emph>heiress</emph> he loves, not simple Lucille Mowbray."</p>
               <p>"You cannot expect to be simple Lucille Mowbray, to those who know your wealth and
                  station," said Maggie, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Then I can never be loved unselfishly," sighed the heiress.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, dear Lucille; I meant no such thing. Were you a poor dependent, like
                  myself, that purity of soul which mirrors itself in your dark eye, must command
                  the heart's homage. I do not mean to flatter you, when I say that Lucille Mowbray
                  is far more worthy of love than the heiress of Mowbray Hall."</p>
               <p>"In your partial eyes, Maggie, I do not doubt it; but to me all hearts seem
                  locked, only to be opened by the golden key I hold in my pocket. I sometimes wish
                  I was poor, Maggie, and then I should not be so easily deceived."</p>
               <p>"You would not breathe that wish again, Lucille, did you but know half the
                  bitterness poverty brings its victims. But come, our wise heads will never devise
                  a remedy for this monstrous evil, so let's charm it away with music divine," and
                  Margaret Singleton took her guitar, and in a sweet clear voice, sang a lively air,
                  while Lucille, in dreamy reverie, sank back upon her couch.</p>
               <p>"I have it! I have it!" at length she gayly exclaimed, as the song ceased. "Oh,
                  Maggie, what a capital idea!" and her merry laugh rang out its silvery notes
                  through the ocean's roar.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7276-00000051"/>
               <p>"Pray, Lucille," cried Margaret, "what is it? let me laugh too over your new
                  idea."</p>
               <p>"Why, it's just this: I'm going to be the 'poor dependent' you call yourself, and
                  you shall be the rich heiress—Miss Mowbray, don't you understand?"</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot understand such a preposterous idea," exclaimed Margaret warmly.</p>
               <p>"Now, Maggie dear, just please me this once, and you little know the happiness you
                  may confer on me."</p>
               <p>"But I cannot assume such a character, Lucille, though to please you I might
                  try."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do</emph> but just make the trial," persisted the fair pleader," and I'll
                  venture you. Your style of beauty, with the queenly air you sometimes wear, is
                  more befitting the daughter of Sir Charles Mowbray, than my simple face and
                  childish curls,"—and Lucille shook from its fastening her soft brown hair,
                  covering her neck and shoulders with its wavy brightness.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful as a fairy," Maggie exclaimed, with involuntary admiration.</p>
               <p>Beautiful indeed was that sweet face, uplifted to hers, but far more beautiful the
                  inner sanctuary of this lovely temple.</p>
               <p>"There, Maggie darling," said Lucille, kissing her cheek, "you may flatter me as
                  much as you please, if you'll only do as I wish you too."</p>
               <p>"I do not comprehend you yet, Lucille," replied her companion, returning the
                  caress;—"what is it you would have me do?"</p>
               <p>"Help me to find out my true value," was the reply, so earnestly made that Maggie
                  looked with astonishment at the fair speaker.</p>
               <p>"How do you expect to do that?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"If you would consent to change positions with me, dear Maggie, while we are among
                  strangers, it would give me a most charming opportunity to know just what I am
                  worth,—in the world's estimation I mean, without my possessions. The simple,
                  unpretending companion of an heiress can see and hear many things, of which the
                  heiress herself never dreamed. Say you will, dear Maggie, humor me in this whim,
                  if you please to call it so; my heart is really set upon it."</p>
               <p>"But you do not think what a serious annoyance it might prove to you, Lucille.
                  Suppose you find, as you hope to, your mother's relatives."</p>
               <p>Lucille bit her lip,—"I didn't think of that," said she; "but if we do fine them,
                  it will be time enough then to disclose ourselves."</p>
               <p>"What will you do with John?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll make some pretence to send him back, when we get quietly settled."</p>
               <p>"Then, there are your letters to an attorney in Boston, and a Mr. Thornton—nobody
                  knows where."</p>
               <p>"You can deliver them, as Miss Mowbray, while I stand by and enjoy the sensation
                  you will create as a great heiress. Won't that be capital?" cried Lucille,
                  eagerly.</p>
               <p>"It's rather a dangerous experiment, I fear," said Maggie, throwing her arm around
                  her companion, "but<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7276-00000052"/> to please my darling
                  Lucille, I would do almost any thing."</p>
               <p>"Then you consent?" joyfully exclaimed Lucille.</p>
               <p>"I do, upon one condition," replied Maggie, "that if our ruse bring a shadow upon
                  your heart, it shall be disclosed at once, and you resume your own name and
                  position."</p>
               <p>"I fear no shadows so much as those which Mowbray Hall and its estates make,"
                  laughingly rejoined Lucille.</p>

               <p>THE legal profession, at the time of which we write, was scarcely among the
                  aspirations of the common class of people. Intellect of a high order, wealth, and
                  influential friends, were considered indispensable to its success. The last two
                  requisites, with an imaginary allowance of the first, had many years before placed
                  Richard Morton at the bar, and subsequently elevated him to the bench, evincing in
                  his friends, as he declared, 'a most remarkable discernment and appreciation of
                  talent.'</p>
               <p>Judge Morton, then, to whom Miss Mowbray brought letters from her own solicitor,
                  occupied a high position, in society, though not one spark of nature's nobility
                  lighted his soul.</p>
               <p>In happy contrast to the sordid spirit of the father, was the high-souled, manly
                  heart of young Morton, his only son. Imperious and haughty as he often appeared in
                  the artificial life he led at home, there yet flowed<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000053"/> through his veins the warm beatings of a generous,
                  impulsive nature.</p>
               <p>Not so his associate in the study of his father's profession. Young Atherton, son
                  of our old friend Mark, was just what his mother designed he should be—selfish,
                  worldly, and proud. Judge Morton's character and position suited her well, and it
                  was with no little satisfaction, therefore, that she persuaded him to receive
                  Albert into his office.</p>
               <p>The three occupants of that office were, one morning, busily engaged in their
                  respective duties, when a servant entered, and placing a package on the desk of
                  the elder; silently withdrew.</p>
               <p>"What's this!" exclaimed the judge, as he unfolded a tiny note which accompanied
                  the package, and read,—"Miss Mowbray will be happy to see Judge Morton at his
                  earliest convenience." "I suppose, however, this will explain it," he added,
                  breaking the seal of the other. "Ah! yes, yes, I see," he mused, while his eye ran
                  delightedly over its contents. "Here's rich news for you boys; or rather for you,
                  Dick, since Albert's heart has gone out of his possession."</p>
               <p>"What is it, sir?" quickly exclaimed both students.</p>
               <p>"The heiress of Mowbray Hall, one of the finest estates in England—worth an
                  immense fortune, has arrived here, as this letter says, in search of her mother's
                  relatives."</p>
               <p>"But what have you to do with it, father?" asked Richard, while young Atherton's
                  face bespoke the deep interest he felt.</p>
               <p>"Her attorney, a Mr. Broughton, whom I knew when I was abroad, has written to
                  request me to honor her drafts, and also to render her any assistance in my power;
                  which you cannot doubt I shall do, while I have such a son," he added, with a
                  meaning smile at Richard.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said Richard, haughtily; "I have no fancy for fortune-hunting;
                  your attentions to Miss Mowbray need have no reference to me."</p>
               <p>"You needn't put on such airs, Dick," retorted his father; "Miss Mowbray, I
                  presume, will be willing that you should treat her with all the hauteur you
                  please. For my part, I do not expect any thing from you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir," was the reply, in a bitter tone, as Richard Morton resumed his
                  book.</p>
               <p>"Can I be of any service to you, sir?" asked Albert, insinuatingly.</p>
               <p>"You!"—and Judge Morton gazed steadily into the young man's face for a
                  moment,—"Yes, you can perform a son's duty, refused by him. Come with me."</p>
               <p>Albert saw the flush on young Morton's brow as they left his presence, but he knew
                  not that for him mantled that blush of shame, or that, better than himself,
                  Richard Morton read the dark workings of his unprincipled heart.</p>
               <p>Brilliant lights gleamed through the windows of Judge Morton's aristocratic
                  mansion,—carriages rolled in rapid succession to and from his stately door,—fair
                  forms, resplendent with gems and jewels rare, flitted<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000054"/> through his spacious drawing-rooms. Beauty and
                  fashion reigned with magnificent sway over the elite assembled there. Judge Morton
                  had opened his doors this evening in honor of the heiress, for whom he professed a
                  deep interest. He had literally fulfilled the request of Miss Mowbray's attorney,
                  and placed himself entirely at her service. Mrs. Morton and her daughters seconded
                  his efforts, by rendering every attention in their power to the beautiful
                  stranger; but Richard Morton, still suffering keenly from his father's reproach,
                  did not attempt to conceal his aversion to such mammon worship. He had called, it
                  is true, as an attendant to his mother and sisters, but he could not have told,
                  had he been asked, whether Miss Mowbray was beautiful, or accomplished. He saw her
                  only as the impersonation of a principle, against which his better nature
                  revolted. Especially on this evening, when the waiting multitude seemed eager to
                  do homage, not to her worth certainly, for of that they knew nothing—not to her
                  beauty, for among them were earth's fairest daughters; but to the perishable form,
                  around which the fickle goddess, Fortune, had thrown her mantle—on this evening,
                  especially, did Richard Morton's proud lip curl with scorn, as he vowed within
                  himself that, even for his family's sake, he would have no part in this farce.
                  Haughtily he withdrew to an unnoticed position, as "Miss Mowbray and friend" were
                  announced; but, as if by magnetism, his eyes were drawn towards her for whom all
                  this display had been made. Clad in a magnificent purple robe of rich velvet, with
                  no ornament save one large, lustrous diamond shining on her breast, and the deep,
                  glowing scarlet blossoms twined among her raven braids, Miss Mowbray entered the
                  room with queenly grace. Richard noticed her now, as he had never done before. She
                  was beautiful; even his fastidious taste must concede that. That she was far
                  superior to the throng of gay butterflies around her, he could see at a glance.
                  That lofty brow, which to them was but the type of her noble blood, he saw as the
                  broad signet of a mind refined and cultivated. Yet her beauty did not please him,
                  as did the softer radiance of her friend and companion. In <emph>her</emph> dark,
                  earnest eyes, he read a woman's heart—warm, loving, trustful. Her simple, snowy
                  drapery, with the moss-buds nestling in her soft brown curls, seemed fit emblems
                  of the purity of her heart. But while Richard gazed upon this fair being, till his
                  whole soul seemed drawn by some invisible power towards her, Mrs. Morton had
                  greeted her guests, and introduced them in the most approved style. Albert
                  Atherton, whose elegant exterior and fascinating manners might well be compared to
                  Eden's tempter, with the easy assurance of one who fears no repulse, drew Miss
                  Mowbray's arm within his own, as he said in a low tone,—"I must claim the
                  privilege of presenting you to my mother, who, most opportunely, arrived in town
                  to-day." He might have added with truth,—"She came to assist me in winning this
                  rich prize."</p>
               <p>"I should scarcely need an introduction," was Miss Mowbray's smiling reply, as
                  they approached a splendid-looking<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7276-00000055"/>
                  did-looking lady, to whom, he presented her, "the resemblance is so striking I
                  must at once have recognized your mother, though you had not told me of her
                  presence."</p>
               <p>"For which compliment," returned he, gallantly bowing, "you have my most sincere
                  thanks."</p>
               <p>"Nay," said Mrs. Atherton, with motherly pride, "rather is it I who should thank
                  Miss Mowbray for her delicate compliment."</p>
               <p>"I do not see but we must bear our honors together then," he replied, laughing;
                  "but," he added, in a more serious tone, "to be like my mother, Miss Mowbray, is
                  my highest aim."</p>
               <p>"I think I can appreciate your feelings, Mr. Atherton," she replied, with an
                  approving glance, "though to me no such guide has been given."</p>
               <p>"You have no mother, then," remarked Mrs. Atherton, to whom the fact was perfectly
                  well known.</p>
               <p>"My parents both died when I was young—" and a shade of sadness passed over her
                  face,—"indeed I have no near relatives that I am aware of. But that reminds me of
                  my friend, Miss Singleton," she added, suddenly looking around: "where can she be?
                  I ought not to have left her so abruptly."</p>
               <p>"Richard Morton has her under his care just now," said Albert, with a scarcely
                  perceptible sneer, which, however, did not escape the observant eyes of his
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Morton at all like his father?" she inquired, turning to Mrs.
                  Atherton.</p>
               <p>"Not in the least," quickly replied that lady.</p>
               <p>"In what do they differ?"</p>
               <p>"In every thing pertaining to social life. Judge Morton, as you must have seen, is
                  one of the most agreeable, gentlemanly, and kind-hearted men in the world; but Ins
                  son, I am sorry to say, is sadly deficient in all those qualities which would be
                  most pleasing to his friends."</p>
               <p>Miss Mowbray cast a troubled glance towards her friend, who was in an animated
                  conversation with young Morton.</p>
               <p>"Is he then so depraved?" said she, "one would not think so from the open, frank
                  expression on his face; he has a very noble bearing."</p>
               <p>"And that, in the opinion of some ladies, will cover a multitude of sins," said
                  Albert, laughing, though he felt annoyed at her remark.</p>
               <p>Miss Mowbray's reply was hushed by the soft, sweet strains of a harp, accompanied
                  by a voice full of rich, gushing melody. At the same moment Judge Morton came
                  towards them, and playfully bantering Albert upon his monopoly of their guest,
                  offered to conduct her nearer the fair singer, adding with a meaning smile, "you
                  will find young Atherton is quite a connoisseur in beauty."</p>
               <p>"The devil take him," muttered Albert in a low tone to his mother,—"he'll blow up
                  the whole thing, yet."</p>
               <p>"We must follow them," she replied in the same<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000056"/> tone, "or the impression you have evidently made
                  will be lost."</p>
               <p>"How exquisitely beautiful!—nay, how angelic!" exclaimed Miss Mowbray, as the last
                  sounds of the harp died away, and a murmur of applause greeted the sweet
                  singer.</p>
               <p>"You may well say angelic," replied the Judge, warmly, "for if ever angel dwelt on
                  earth, Agnes Blair is one. I must introduce her to you."</p>
               <p>The unconscious object of these remarks advanced with blushing timidity towards
                  them, and as her eye fell upon Albert Atherton, who was also approaching them, the
                  warm, bright flush deepened over neck, cheek, and brow. A quick glance at Miss
                  Mowbray assured the young man that she had not noticed the cause of Agnes's
                  confusion. With an indifferent air, therefore, he coldly saluted her, whose young,
                  beautiful life was but a breathing incense for him, and whose heart he had
                  gathered all within his own.</p>
               <p>"Agnes," said he, in a voice which reached no ear save hers, "pray do not make
                  such a fool of yourself before strangers; restrain your blushes till a more
                  fitting time."</p>
               <p>Could this be the voice that, but one short week since, whispered such words of
                  passionate love and undying devotion, in tones whose lingering sweetness yet
                  vibrated in her soul! Alas! poor Agnes! this is but the first fragment of the
                  crumbling idol you worship. God help thee, when the whole lies in shattered ruins
                  at thy feet!</p>
               <p>It was but one short moment's work—that speeding of the fatal arrow, and he, the
                  ruthless spoiler, passed on with an unchanged smile to the shrine where he would
                  bow. With an accent of alarm Miss Mowbray sprang past him, and caught the fainting
                  form of the fair girl, whose beauty had so impressed her; at the same moment a
                  strong arm was under hers, and Richard Morton bore the unconscious maiden out into
                  the fresh air.</p>
               <p>"How very suddenly she fainted," said Miss Mowbray, who had followed them, and now
                  joined in his vigorous efforts to restore animation; "but a moment since her
                  cheeks rivalled the richest rose."</p>
               <p>"Ay, a rose indeed," replied he bitterly, "with a canker worm in its folds."</p>
               <p>Miss Mowbray looked up inquiringly; but it was no time for explanations, as a
                  crowd had already gathered around them in anxious solicitude.</p>
               <p>"She seems reviving," at length said Richard, and with a smile and graceful wave
                  of the hand he added,—"perhaps it would be better for Miss Blair to be left alone
                  while she recovers."</p>
               <p>All save one withdrew immediately to the drawing-rooms. She would have lingered by
                  the fair sufferer's side, but the decided, though courteous manner in which
                  Richard spoke—"Miss Mowbray, my father waits to conduct you back to our
                  guests,"—seemed to give her no power to remain, and she returned thither also.</p>
               <p>Richard Morton had acquired a new interest in her<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000057"/> eyes, within the last few moments. She had believed
                  what Mrs. Atherton and Albert told her of his strange perversity and coldness, but
                  the deep, earnest, tender thoughtfulness of his manner, as he bent over the
                  fainting girl, and the superiority evidently conceded to him by others, shook her
                  faith in them.</p>
               <p>"Miss Blair has created quite a sensation," was Albert's cool remark, as she
                  joined her friend near him, "how is she now?"</p>
               <p>"She was better when I left her, though not fully recovered," Miss Mowbray
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"She will doubtless revive speedily in Mr. Morton's care."</p>
               <p>Again Miss Mowbray saw the same sneer she had before noticed, when Albert spoke of
                  Richard Morton.</p>
               <p>"Ah," said she playfully, "a little jealous, I see."</p>
               <p>"A thousand times, no," earnestly replied Albert; "Miss Blair is very pretty,
                  certainly, but hers is not the style of beauty I admire."</p>
               <p>"I cannot agree with you then, for her face struck me at first sight, as the most
                  perfectly beautiful one I had ever seen,—so much purity and sweetness in
                  it;—angelic seemed the only fit term to apply to it."</p>
               <p>"Rightly applied too," said Richard Morton, who had joined them unobserved,—"Miss
                  Blair deserves all that you can say in her praise."</p>
               <p>"No doubt <emph>you</emph> think so," young Atherton replied, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"I do," said Richard, turning his eye meaningly upon the speaker, "and if rumor be
                  true, I am not the only one."</p>
               <p>"All this may be very pleasant to you, young men," said Mrs. Atherton, who had
                  been quietly listening, "but, Miss Mowbray, I think you and I can be quite as
                  agreeably entertained elsewhere; will you walk with me, and leave these valiant
                  knights to wage their own battles?"</p>
               <p>Not a word or look did the haughty woman deign to bestow upon Miss Mowbray's
                  friend,—for was not her situation a menial one? What if her dark eye beamed with
                  rich mental lore? what if nature had traced rare beauty on her brow? she was but
                  the companion, another name for servant, of the heiress. Would she but have looked
                  into that face, so much beneath her notice, as she turned in her blind homage to
                  fortune, she might have read in the flashing eye and curling lip, the proud
                  contempt of a superior nature. Richard Morton saw it, and his heart's response was
                  in the long, earnest gaze he bent upon her.</p>

               <p>To Willow Glen we gladly turn our longing steps. Sweet Willow Glen! no lapse of
                  years can bring decay to thee! Ever fresh and green are thy bowers, watered by the
                  dew of peace—nourished and strengthened in the sunlight of love. Within thy walls,
                  earth's purest joys are found,—for there, in shining robes of heaven's own
                  texture, abideth one, whose magic wand holds in abeyance life's troublous waves,
                  and tips with golden colors time's swift-winged messenger. Angel of Charity! well
                  hast thou chosen this thy home! earth has but few dwelling places for such as
                  thee. Here then ever abide, hope's bright beacon to the tempest-tossed on the dark
                  waters of life!</p>
               <p>In the richly stored library of this charming retreat, sat Melville Thornton. No
                  lines of care—no snowy pencillings, tell of the years that have passed since last
                  we saw him. Content, deep and joyful, has chased from his brow its habitual look
                  of sadness, and the heart's smile of gladness plays ever around his lips.
                  Manhood's noblest type of strength and beauty is he.</p>
               <p>Near him, leaning forward, as in an earnest, animated tone he spoke, sat an
                  elderly gentleman, whose face Melville Thornton had for the last half hour been
                  scrutinizing, apparently not much to his satisfaction; for he replied, somewhat
                  impatiently, as the other ceased speaking:—</p>
               <p>"You must excuse me, Judge Morton; but I really cannot see your object in making
                  this communication to me."</p>
               <p>"In making you a confidant of my thoughts and wishes on this subject," said the
                  Judge, "I hope to secure your aid. Miss Mowbray, I think, could be easily
                  influenced by a person like you."</p>
               <p>"I have not seen Miss Mowbray yet," Mr. Thornton replied evasively; "but I shall
                  be most happy to entertain the daughter of one I esteemed so highly as Sir
                  Charles. His kindness to me when abroad, is one of the few pleasant memories I
                  cherish."</p>
               <p>"So much the better for my hopes," added the Judge. "Miss Mowbray reveres her
                  father's memory; and one who has known and esteemed him has a sure passport to her
                  confidence."</p>
               <p>"You surely would not have me gain her confidence, if I could, for such ends as
                  you propose," quickly rejoined Mr. Thornton, looking keenly at his companion.</p>
               <p>"No, certainly not," replied the Judge, fearing he<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000059"/> had ventured too far; "but a little bias given to
                  her mind might, you know, be sufficient."</p>
               <p>Melville Thornton paced the room uneasily a few moments; then, pausing before his
                  guest, he said:—</p>
               <p>"Your years, Judge Morton, entitle you to the respect which I yield; but I tell
                  you now, decidedly, that I will never connive at, or allow in my house, any such
                  manœuvring as you have suggested. If your son and Miss Mowbray know and appreciate
                  each other sufficiently to marry, they shall have my best wishes; but by no word
                  or look of mine shall either be influenced."</p>
               <p>Judge Morton restrained the anger which rose to his lips. He felt the importance
                  of retaining Mr. Thornton's friendship, though he could not make him the tool he
                  wished.</p>
               <p>"At least," he replied in a courteous tone, "this conversation shall be strictly
                  confidential. I should not have been so frank, had I not known that I was talking
                  with a man of honor. Let it all pass, as a foolish father's over anxiety for the
                  happiness of his only son. Shall I see Mrs. Thornton?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir; my wife will be most happy to meet you," said Mr. Thornton,
                  leading the way to the parlor, surprised and gratified at the happy termination of
                  their interview.</p>
               <p>Light hearts, merry faces, and busy tongues, were in the elegant carriage which
                  whirled its way so rapidly from the noise and dust of city life. Gayly, as the
                  prancing horses bounded over hill and dale, opened new scenes of beauty to the
                  delighted travellers. Strangers in a strange land were they; but nature smiled
                  upon them in the familiar robes of an old friend, and the same bright sun kissed
                  their cheeks, as it oft had done in their English home. They could not feel like
                  strangers; for in the heart of one dwelt the remembrance of a jewel found here,
                  whose costly price was the warm life-blood flowing in her own veins. A mother's
                  land! could it be strange to the heart of her child!</p>
               <p>"I can scarcely realize," said Miss Mowbray, as for a moment they rode in silence,
                  "I can scarcely realize that we are in America;—that the warm breath of this soft
                  spring morning comes not from our own heather hills."</p>
               <p>"Why, did you expect to find our climate as cold as our natures?" asked Albert
                  Atherton, laughing.</p>
               <p>"And if I did," was her smiling retort, "the short experience I have had must have
                  determined that question."</p>
               <p>"But how? you do not tell us how;" he added with more earnestness in his manner
                  than he was aware of.</p>
               <p>"I find the sun glowing as warmly upon your hills as ours; and
                  hearts—natures—where could nobler or warmer be found?"</p>
               <p>Unconsciously the eye of the speaker, as she said this, fell, not upon him so
                  intently watching her every word and look, but into the corner where Richard
                  Morton sat.</p>
               <p>Albert bit his lips with vexation.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7276-00000060"/>
               <p>"You may see cause to change your mind yet," said he; "remember, you have only
                  known us a few short weeks."</p>
               <p>"And what if I should tell you, that in those few short weeks I had changed my
                  mind materially," she replied with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Then I might dare to hope that still it would change, till it should bring me
                  into your favor," said he in a tone intended for her ear alone.</p>
               <p>He could not interpret the quick, searching glance Miss Mowbray gave him, or the
                  coolness with which she pointed to her friend some object in the distance. He had
                  not learned her yet; but for all that, his zeal had not abated, nor his purpose
                  changed. He would rather far that the brown curls, and soft, gentle eyes of her
                  beautiful companion belonged to the heiress; for with her he felt at ease; but he
                  involuntarily shrank from the keen glance of Miss Mowbray's black eyes, which
                  seemed to read his very soul.</p>
               <p>"Here we are at last," exclaimed Richard Morton, as the carriage wound through a
                  shady avenue, and drew up before the door of Melville Thornton's lovely home.</p>
               <p>"English! English!" cried Miss Singleton, looking around, "how like our own
                  pleasant homes!"</p>
               <p>"It is indeed charming—delightful!" said Miss Mowbray, as they ascended the
                  steps.</p>
               <p>We will not listen to the warm, earnest words of welcome with which Charlotte
                  Thornton gladdened the hearts of her stranger guests, for well we know that deceit
                  dwelleth not there. Rather will we glance over the fair page, where, in the
                  solitude of his chamber, Albert Atherton daguerreotyped his thoughts and feelings
                  to her whose type he bore.</p>
               <p>"Dear Mother" (thus it read), "Here I am at last, mewed up in this puritanical
                  hole, where, but for one thing, I would not have put my head during my natural
                  life. Bah! the very air is filled with the pestilential odors of almshouses and
                  hospitals. My uncle (for I call him so now) might have a very stylish place of it
                  here, were it not for the miserable, canting philosophy he calls be nevolence,
                  which has turned his house into a common resort for beggars and idlers of all
                  sorts. I quite agree with you, that he might have been an ornament to society, but
                  for his foolish marriage with a person of Aunt Lottie's peculiar habits. But
                  enough of him; I am at a loss what report to make of my progress in a certain
                  quarter. Sometimes the prize seems just within my grasp, when, as I attempt to
                  secure it, away it goes, farther than ever. I only wish the little jade that's
                  with her was the heiress; I could get on famously with her. You need have no fear
                  of Dick Morton's rival-ship, for he is over head and ears in love with Miss
                  Singleton, though sometimes I think Miss Mowbray likes him better than she does
                  me. As I said in my last letter, I shall leave no means untried, to gain the
                  object you and I both so much desire. But every thing about this place is so
                  repugnant to my feelings, I fear I shall not get on much without your help. How
                  would it do for you, and perhaps Nettie, to pay a little visit to these<pb
                     n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7276-00000061"/> dear relations of yours just now? Dick
                  and I are off to Boston soon, and you can use your own good judgment, whether to
                  come before or after we go. Miss Mowbray admires my elegant mother so much, that
                  your presence might materially aid your son's cause. I hope father will not get
                  wind of what we are about, else in his righteous indignation, he might insist upon
                  my marrying Agnes Blair, or cut me off with a shilling. I leave that all for you
                  to manage, and as in duty bound, am ever your affectionate son."</p>
               <p>Days and weeks flew by, and still the two friends lingered at Willow Glen. Mr.
                  Thornton had persuaded them to remain as his guests, while he put forth every
                  effort to discover the relatives of Miss Mowbray's mother, if any such existed.
                  And there, in the heart of this happy home, their spirits found rest. Orphans they
                  no longer seemed, as the gentle voice and loving Words of Charlotte Thornton drew
                  them within her warm motherly embrace. No need, there, of the disguise they had
                  chosen,—no fear that the distinguished name and rich possessions of one would
                  endear her more, or that the poverty and dependence of the other would lessen her,
                  in the admiration and esteem of those noble hearts. Around that domestic altar,
                  where in pure harmony their souls met, name, station, wealth, were all unknown.
                  But the calm of those happy days, when their heart's desires seemed realized,
                  could not long endure. Deep the waters must be stirred, when a tempting bait lured
                  on the greedy victim. The world,—the selfish world, will not long suffer its rich
                  gems to lie hidden from sight. And so, to the peaceful quiet of Willow Glen,
                  searching for its treasure, came this selfish world, in the form of Mrs. Mark
                  Atherton. She had deemed it wisest to wait till after the departure of her son and
                  Richard Morton. She could then better determine what impressions had been
                  made.</p>
               <p>Like a sunbeam playing around the dark cloud's path, Nettie, still the
                  golden-haired, gloriously beautiful Nettie, appeared at her mother's side. Years
                  of sorrowful estrangement, in which she had been sternly forbade to speak, or
                  think of the dear one whose arms had cradled her infancy, and whose memory was
                  ever her guiding star, were all forgotten, as again those arms clasped her fondly,
                  and the voice she so loved whispered tenderly in her ear.</p>
               <p>"My own darling, precious Nettie! thank God we meet again!"</p>
               <p>"Aunt Lottie! dear—dear Aunt Lottie!" was all the happy girl could say, as she
                  clung around her neck.</p>
               <p>"Lennette," said her mother reprovingly, "you forget there are strangers here.
                  Miss Mowbray will think I have brought a silly child with me."</p>
               <p>But Miss Mowbray thought no such thing, as the blushing girl in her own sweet way
                  held out her hand, saying,</p>
               <p>"The ladies, I am sure, will pardon me for forgetting every thing else, in the joy
                  of meeting my dear aunt, after a long absence."</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7276-00000062"/>
               <p>"I only wonder," said Miss Mowbray, clasping the proffered hand, "that you can be
                  absent long from such an aunt."</p>
               <p>"My daughter finds it necessary to devote her whole attention to her education,"
                  Mrs. Atherton replied apologetically.</p>
               <p>"We are rejoiced that she has come with you now," said Mr. Thornton; "we have been
                  planning some jaunts for our young friends here, and Nettie will make a most
                  welcome addition to our party."</p>
               <p>"That she will," they both replied, and Mrs. Mark Atherton saw with satisfaction
                  the admiring glance bestowed on her beautiful daughter. "From sister to brother,"
                  she thought, "will be but a short step."</p>

               <p>"Now for Woodbine Lodge, ladies," said Mr. Thornton one fine morning, about a week
                  after Mrs. Atherton and Nettie came.</p>
               <p>"Where is that?" asked Mrs. A.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is but a short distance from here," he replied, "but it might as well be
                  in England, as far as the neighbors are concerned."</p>
               <p>"Why so?"</p>
               <p>"Because its owner possesses the spirit of exclusiveness," said Mr. Thornton.
                  "Although untenanted, the grounds, which are very large, and elegantly laid out,
                  are enclosed with a high wall, allowing ingress and egress only through the
                  porter's lodge, which is also well guarded."</p>
               <p>"Quite in the English style, is it not?" Mrs. Atherton asked, turning to Miss
                  Mowbray.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, we love the free air and open fields too well to wall ourselves in," she
                  replied; "besides, how can<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7276-00000063"/> the poor,
                  who cannot afford such things, find enjoyment, if we shut out from their sight the
                  beautiful creations of nature and art our means may bring around us."</p>
               <p>"The poor are made to find enjoyment in their labors," said Mrs. Atherton.</p>
               <p>"But do you not think they are fitted for higher pleasures?" Miss Mowbray asked
                  with surprise.</p>
               <p>"Possibly," returned Mrs. Atherton, unwilling to disagree with the heiress.</p>
               <p>"If I might be permitted to express my opinion," said Miss Singleton, bending full
                  her earnest eye upon Mrs. Atherton, "and being among the poorer class, I think I
                  can judge,—there is even a higher appreciation of natural beauty, and moral worth
                  too, with them, than with those who see every thing through golden
                  eye-glasses."</p>
               <p>"That is certainly true," spoke Mr. Thornton approvingly, "I have often found in
                  some poor cottager a delicacy of sentiment and taste that would honor a queen. But
                  as it is the hour I promised the agent we would be there, suppose we defer the
                  remainder of this conversation, till our return from Woodbine Lodge."</p>
               <p>This was gladly agreed to, and the party set forth in high spirits for their
                  ramble.</p>
               <p>Condescending and agreeable as was for her interest to be, Mrs. Atherton walked
                  beside Mr. and Mrs. Thornton, while with bright faces and laughing voices the
                  happy trio followed them. As in a glass face answereth to face, so did the hearts
                  of these maidens mirror to each other its own purity and truth. Strangers though
                  they were, but one short week since, they seemed to have grown into the confidence
                  and love of years. As, gayly chatting, with arms entwined, as were their hearts,
                  this triad of graces moved on, many an eye turned to gaze again and again upon
                  their rare loveliness.</p>
               <p>Woodbine Lodge fully justified the involuntary burst of admiration with which the
                  little party entered its grounds. Like a fairy scene, its fountains, grottos,
                  streams, and wooded lawns spread before them, while, through a long vista of noble
                  trees, the imposing front of a splendid mansion met their eyes. Mr. Faulkner, the
                  agent of this untenanted paradise, after a few moments' private conversation with
                  Mr. Thornton, invited the ladies to make themselves at home in this beautiful
                  retreat, and to examine the grounds, with or without his guidance, as they
                  pleased. To the latter the young ladies joyfully assented, and were soon lost in
                  one of its shaded walks.</p>
               <p>"Now I will talk with you more freely," said Mr. Thornton to the agent, as they
                  disappeared from sight. "I thought it not best to say any thing to Miss Mowbray
                  about it, till she had seen and appreciated the place."</p>
               <p>"But do you know that she intends purchasing at all here?" asked the agent, in
                  rather a disappointed tone.</p>
               <p>"No, I do not know that such are her intentions," replied Mr. Thornton, "but I
                  think it would require<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7276-00000064"/> but little
                  persuasion to induce her to do so, especially as there are no ties to bind her
                  elsewhere."</p>
               <p>"Would she sell her English estate?"</p>
               <p>"Probably not; her father's home is sacred in her eyes, and she is sufficiently
                  able to hold both."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton's eye glistened as she heard this. "That would be delightful," said
                  she; "then we may hope to keep Miss Mowbray near us most of the time."</p>
               <p>"Not so fast," said Mr. Thornton, laughing, "Miss Mowbray is yet to be consulted;
                  this is our plan, not hers."</p>
               <p>"You will please to excuse me for a few moments," said Mr. Faulkner, as he ushered
                  them into the house. "I have promised to meet a few other visitors here today, and
                  it is about time for them to arrive."</p>
               <p>Through winding paths and shady groves, the three friends delightedly roved, each
                  new beauty, as it unfolded, eliciting their warmest admiration. At last, to
                  complete the enchantment, they came to a spot where all cultivation ceased, and
                  nature in its wild beauty lay before them.</p>
               <p>"Can any thing be more gloriously beautiful!" exclaimed Miss Mowbray's
                  companion,—her dark eye glowing with enthusiasm,—"I could be content ever to dwell
                  here."</p>
               <p>"It is more beautiful than any thing I have ever seen, except your own home,"
                  replied the other in a low tone.</p>
               <p>The first speaker cast a quick look towards Nettie, who reclined in a graceful
                  attitude at the foot of a tree near them, her whole soul filled with the beauty
                  around her.</p>
               <p>"You must be more cautious, Maggie," said she softly, "two or three times you have
                  come very near disclosing all."</p>
               <p>"And why not disclose all, Lucille? I hate the false character I bear: and you,
                  with your noble birth and station, to appear as a dependent at my side! I
                  cannot,—indeed, I cannot endure it much longer."</p>
               <p>"If you knew, dear Maggie, how much happiness it had already caused me, your
                  unselfish heart would, I am sure, yield to the sacrifice a little longer,"—and the
                  fair girl hid her blushing face as she thought of the unspoken love she had read
                  in Richard Morton's eye.</p>
               <p>"I will do all that you wish, dear Lucille," replied the other, soothingly; "but I
                  fear we shall get entangled in a web not of our own making."</p>
               <p>"You mean the one Mrs. Atherton is weaving for you," said Lucille, with a bright
                  smile,—"how does her son progress in winning the heiress?"</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said Maggie, pointing to 88Nettie, "we must speak very low, or she may
                  hear us. How strange that <emph>she</emph> should have such a mother and
                  brother."</p>
               <p>"She is an angel;" earnestly exclaimed Lucille,—"one could almost love her brother
                  for her sake."</p>
               <p>"Suppose you try it then," said Maggie, laughing; "for you are really the one he
                  seeks, though he knows it not."</p>
               <p>"He reminds me too strongly of young Hastings," replied Lucille. "Ah! Maggie, this
                  ruse of ours was<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7276-00000065"/> a happy thought, if it
                  do not cause you too much pain."</p>
               <p>"My pain is principally on your account, dear Lucille," said Maggie, "so if you
                  are happier, it shall continue as long as you wish."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Maggie darling; you can scarcely realize how important it is to my
                  happiness, to remain incog. for the present at least." Again did the fail blushing
                  face betray its secret.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lucille! perhaps I know more than"—</p>
               <p>An exclamation from Nettie cut off the remaining sentence, and caused both to turn
                  towards her with surprise. Unperceived by them, a gentleman had approached the
                  spot where she reclined in unconscious loveliness. They did not see the deep,
                  earnest gaze which he bent upon her, or his quick, bright glance of recognition,
                  as he sprang to her side. They only heard her joyful cry, as her hand was clasped
                  in his, while her face shone with radiant light.</p>
               <p>"Nettie!"</p>
               <p>"Lonny!"—treasury of words to the hearts that had hoarded them.</p>
               <p>"But too truly has my bright dream been realized," exclaimed he, gazing with
                  rapture into her beautiful face.</p>
               <p>"How strange that we should so quickly have recognized each other," said Nettie,
                  "and you so changed too." Her lips did not add, what her eyes so plainly said,
                  that the change was far from being unfavorable to him.</p>
               <p>"You did not expect to find me the same rude, uncouth object that you parted from
                  ten years ago, I hope," he replied, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Whatever I expected," said she with a merry laugh, "you have appeared before me a
                  very handsome young gentleman, and these young ladies are wondering much who you
                  are; so, Miss Mowbray and Miss Singleton, allow me to introduce to you—what shall
                  I say?—my cousin, Mr. Brown."</p>
               <p>"Such a relationship does me too much honor," said he, bowing to the ladies. "As
                  children we were not allowed to assume it. Where is your mother, Nettie?"</p>
               <p>"She is somewhere here, in company with Aunt Lottie and her husband," Nettie
                  replied with a disturbed look; "but how did you know we were here?"</p>
               <p>"So far from knowing it, I was never more surprised in my life than when I
                  recognized you under the tree. I came with some friends to see the place. But I
                  must go and seek Aunt Lottie."</p>
               <p>"Shall we accompany him?" said Nettie, turning to Miss Mowbray.</p>
               <p>"As you please," she replied; "it is time, I think, that we returned to them."</p>
               <p>Years, or rather kindness and care, had worked wonders in the poor orphan boy Mrs.
                  Atherton had so rudely termed a "pauper foundling." True to his noble purpose,
                  Joseph Atherton counted no sacrifice too great for the beloved child he had taken
                  to his heart. His were no idle words, when he said he would "make a<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000066"/> man of him," though in that term were included
                  nobility of soul and the highest cultivation of the intellect. He <emph>had</emph>
                  made a man of him,—noble, gifted, worthy the love which had thus endowed him. In
                  his untiring devotion to study, it had been more from accident than design that
                  Lonny had not met the friends of his orphanage. Towards his first benefactress,
                  Charlotte Thornton, his heart ever glowed with the warmest gratitude, while like a
                  guardian angel, hovering around him and beckoning him on to the highest paths of
                  honor and virtue, the sweet face and sunny curls his boyhood worshipped seemed
                  ever near him. Nettie had been in all his thoughts and dreams;—Nettie, the first
                  sympathizer in his sorrows, and Nettie, the bright goal for which he labored and
                  prayed. Here then, at last, she stood by his side, the living embodiment of all
                  his most beautiful visions; and from her earnest eye softly stole to his heart the
                  sweet assurance that he was not forgotten.</p>
               <p>Long before they reached the house, Lonny, or Mr. Brown, as we must now call him,
                  for he had not adopted the name of his kind guardian, had quite won the hearts of
                  the young strangers. Miss Mowbray thought him the most agreeable and gentlemanly
                  person she had met, and her companion could except but one. In the best possible
                  humor with each other, therefore, the happy party sought their friends; but not
                  before the watchful eye of Mrs. Mark Atherton had seen their approach, and
                  observed the earnestness with which the stranger, who accompanied them, addressed
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>"Who can that be, Charlotte?" said she, pointing to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>"I do not know," Mrs. Thornton replied; "do you, Melville?"</p>
               <p>"I know of but one face that has so interested me before," said Mr. Thornton,
                  gazing intently at the young man as he drew near; "it must surely be the
                  same,—your brother Joseph's protg."</p>
               <p>Charlotte Thornton did not see the frown gathering on Mrs. Atherton's brow; but,
                  springing forward, she caught the hand extended to her, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible this is my little Lonny!"</p>
               <p>"The boy you saved," replied he with a look of respectful affection.</p>
               <p>"And one too of whom we are justly proud," added Mr. Thornton, warmly grasping the
                  other hand,—"what a happy surprise you have given us! Mrs. Atherton, do you not
                  remember your brother's adopted son?"</p>
               <p>"I believe I have seen <emph>the person</emph> before," Mrs. Atherton replied,
                  drawing herself up into her most freezing attitude.</p>
               <p>Like a thunderbolt the words of Nettie's mother fell upon the young man's
                  heart.—"Pauper foundling!" thought he; "she will never forget that."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Miss Mowbray and her friend stood apart, in low, earnest conversation.
                  They did not heed the cold words and colder looks, with which Mrs. Atherton
                  haughtily turned from the gentleman who had so<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000067"/> interested them. Nettie's tremulous voice and
                  tearful eye, as she softly stole an arm around each, first recalled them from
                  their abstraction.</p>
               <p>"I'm so unhappy," murmured she.</p>
               <p>"What is it, dear?—what is it?" they anxiously inquired.</p>
               <p>"Nettie silently pointed to her mother, on whose face still rested the dark lines
                  of anger and contempt, then at the receding form of Mr. Brown, whom no
                  remonstrances of his friends could detain.—"He's gone," said she, "and my mother
                  has cruelly treated him."</p>
               <p>That night, at Willow Glen, in the sweet confidence of youth, a pure, simple heart
                  unveiled itself to the eye of affection.</p>
               <p>"Tell me," said Nettie, "now that you know all—tell me, am I wrong?"</p>
               <p>"Wrong! "exclaimed Miss Mowbray, while a tear glistened in her companion's eye,
                  "you have ennobled yourself in my estimation. Only be true to yourself, Nettie,—be
                  true to your woman's nature, and even the wrath of your mother shall yet praise
                  the noble, generous, and unselfish love you have so worthily bestowed."</p>
               <p>A smile of joy illumined the fair, lovely face raised to the speaker's, and in
                  that moment of silence their souls were knit together as the soul of one.</p>

               <p>THE next morning, as Mr. Thornton sat quietly engaged in his library, Mrs. Mark
                  Atherton suddenly stood before him. Her usually calm, self-possessed manner, had
                  given place to an air of disturbance and vexation.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I ought not to intrude upon you here," said she, "but if I am not
                  interrupting important business, I should like a few moments' conversation with
                  you."</p>
               <p>"My business is of such a nature," he replied, rising and handing her a chair,
                  "that it can be attended to any other time as well as now. Pray be seated, Mrs.
                  Atherton; I shall be happy to converse with you upon any subject you wish."</p>
               <p>"I may as well come to the matter at once, without preface," said she, taking the
                  proffered seat,—"I wish to know, Mr. Thornton, if the person we met in our walk
                  yesterday, and whom you greeted with apparent<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000068"/> sincerity and warmth, is, or is to be, a frequent
                  visitor at your house?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose you refer to Mr. Brown, your brother's adopted son," replied Mr.
                  Thornton. "I am sorry to say, Mrs. Atherton, that we have not seen him before for
                  many years, and that he has never yet visited Willow Glen."</p>
               <p>"Humph! he will not be long in doing so then," said Mrs. A.; "these low-born
                  fellows are always ready to push themselves as high as possible. Did you observe
                  the insulting familiarity which he used towards my daughter?"</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, madam, I did not even see him speak to your daughter."</p>
               <p>"I did," said she, getting excited, "I saw it all—the mean, base pauper—daring to
                  offer his arm to my child; I could have killed him on the spot for his
                  audacity."</p>
               <p>"You must excuse me, Mrs. Atherton," Mr. Thornton coolly replied; "but I really
                  see no insult or audacity in the gentleman offering his arm to your daughter."</p>
               <p>"Gentleman! repeated she with scorn, "do you call a person whose birth is a shame
                  to him, even in his own low set, a <emph>gentleman?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"If in heart he is pure, in character irreproachable, in mind and person
                  cultivated and refined, I do. Such is Mr. Brown; and no circumstances of birth, or
                  station can make him other than he is—a gentleman."</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornton spoke warmly, and Mrs. Atherton, for reasons of her own, did not
                  think it best to offend him; so she merely replied—</p>
               <p>"We can never agree upon that point, Mr. Thornton, and I do not care to discuss it
                  now. There is one thing, however, in which I think you will agree with me, and
                  that is, in the right and authority of parents to control their children's
                  interests."</p>
               <p>"I am not sure that even there we should not be at variance," Mr. Thornton
                  smilingly replied, "for I consider parental authority a very limited power,
                  reaching neither to the heart nor conscience of the child."</p>
               <p>"But you surely will allow that mothers should control improprieties of conduct in
                  their children."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; mothers and fathers too should do that."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir; we will rest on this common ground then, while I say what I wish
                  to you respecting my daughter."</p>
               <p>"Proceed, madam; any thing concerning Nettie must interest me; she is a girl of
                  rare beauty and excellence."</p>
               <p>"Knowing that as well as I do, Mr. Thornton, you cannot be surprised that I feel
                  the necessity of a vigilant care and watch over her. I know, what perhaps you do
                  not, that she is a very peculiar girl; her tastes, feelings, and habits, are
                  unlike most girls of her age. Your wife has very kindly invited her to remain here
                  for a few weeks with the young lady who is your guest, and I should hope much from
                  the companionship of one who knows the value of high birth and social honors."</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7276-00000069"/>
               <p>"I think you could find no better companions for Nettie," interrupted Mr.
                  Thornton, "than Miss Mow-bray and her friend, and I do most heartily second my
                  wife's invitation that she should remain here, <emph>always,</emph> if she
                  will.</p>
               <p>"Her remaining will depend upon the confidence I can place in you, Mr. Thornton,"
                  was Mrs. Atherton's ungracious answer. "Nettie must not again see the person we
                  met yesterday. It is strange and mortifying, but she has always had a predilection
                  for him, low-born as he is."</p>
               <p>"That shows that our tastes are alike," said Mr. Thornton, smiling. "I have never
                  seen him but twice, and yet he interests me more than any one I ever met. But,
                  Mrs. Atherton," he added in a serious tone, "are you so well satisfied of the
                  young man's unworthiness that you would have me discard him from my house, lest
                  your daughter should love him?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot presume to dictate to you, sir," she replied with something of her old
                  haughtiness; "but I would sooner have my daughter buried, I had almost said
                     <emph>alive,</emph> than to see her degraded so low as to love him."</p>
               <p>"Will you allow me," said Mr. Thornton, "to ask your reasons for disliking Mr.
                  Brown?"</p>
               <p>"It is not mere dislike," she replied hurriedly, "it is hatred. Loathsome object
                  as he was when I <emph>first</emph> saw him, a beggar at my door, he is even more
                  repulsive to me now, seeking, as he does, to hide the beggar under a gentleman's
                  garb. He may deceive others, but to me his face will ever bear the stamp of its
                  low origin."</p>
               <p>"Do you <emph>know</emph> any thing of his parentage, Mrs. Atherton?" Mr. Thornton
                  asked, with some severity in his tone, "or do you condemn him because of his early
                  poverty?"</p>
               <p>"I condemn and despise him for the false character he would wear. As to his
                  parentage, we all know it was from the lowest dregs of humanity."</p>
               <p>"And yet my wife has told me that she once saw a miniature of his mother, which
                  represented her as intelligent and refined, as well as very beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Some picture that was stolen, probably, to make out a good beggar's story," Mrs.
                  Atherton replied contemptuously.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornton was provoked at her heartlessness. "We have indulged in this
                  conversation," said he, "quite long enough. The protection of such a man as Joseph
                  Atherton should be sufficient to guard Mr. Brown from insult, or reproach. Add to
                  this his own high moral and intellectual worth, and I, for one, must ever welcome
                  him to my house and heart."</p>
               <p>"If such be your decision, sir," said Mrs. Atherton, going towards the door, "the
                  question of Nettie's remaining is settled. She goes with me."</p>
               <p>"I beg you will retract that, Mrs. Atherton," said Mr. Thornton, detaining her.
                  "Nettie is very dear to us all, and I will pledge my word of honor, that I will
                  watch over her as tenderly and carefully as though she were my own child."</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7276-00000070"/>
               <p>Without a word of reply, Mrs. Atherton coolly withdrew.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile he, whose bright cup of joy had been so rudely shattered to the earth,
                  wrestled alone with the mighty agony of his soul. All night long he had paced the
                  floor of his solitary chamber. Again and again did his heart send forth its
                  despairing cry into the silence and darkness surrounding him.</p>
               <p>"Why! oh why must this curse be upon me! Why, with mind and talent, aye, and heart
                  too, was I endowed, if the dark spot upon my birth must ever brand me, like the
                  mark of Cain on my forehead! I have borne taunts and insults from my associates; I
                  have felt (oh, how deeply!) the stern decree that shuts me from many so called
                  honorable friends; and with high and noble resolves have I risen superior to
                  these. But when she,—the mother of one who has been the only star in my horizon,
                  looked upon me with that cold, cruel eye of scorn, heart and soul seemed congealed
                  within me. It shall be so no longer. Death a thousand times will I endure, rather
                  than again meet that terrible look; and death—O how much more welcome than life,
                  shut out from the light of hope! My mother! in this sweet image of thee, which so
                  long has lain next my heart, I see no conscious guilt, no look of innocence
                  betrayed;—naught but a pure, unsullied fame can rest upon a brow like thine. Even
                  now, those gentle eyes speak peace to my soul, as in their tender gaze I read a
                  mother's heart—warm, loving and true. Oh, my mother! where shall thy child seek
                  thee! where find rest! I gaze upon thee, and thou seem'st to say to my soul, "Go
                  forth, my son, and vindicate thy fair name and mine;—go, and cease not, till to
                  the world thou canst proclaim thine honorable birth and name." Mother! I hear thy
                  spirit's call,—I go. Here on my knees, before this beautiful emblem, of what thou
                  wert, I vow to Heaven and thee, that this day will I become a pilgrim to the
                  shrine of my mother's grave,—that never, but with life, shall my ceaseless search
                  be stayed, till with proud joy, I claim my happy birthright—<emph>an unstained
                     name!</emph>"</p>
               <p>With the morning's gray light, the young man sought the home which had sheltered
                  his orphan years. In his eye burned the calm and holy light of a noble purpose. He
                  had come forth as from a fiery furnace, purified and strengthened for life's great
                  burden, which now he was to bear. Even the bright dream of hope which had gilded
                  his days, did he banish from his heart, till his vow should be accomplished. He
                  stood in the presence of the beloved protectors of his youth,—they who, in all
                  things save one, had met his every want; whose very kindness had fitted him to
                  feel more keenly this plague spot on his soul. Now, for the first time, did he
                  pour forth the long-concealed burden of his heart—how insults, reproaches and
                  taunts had fallen upon him, till now he was overwhelmed, and could no longer bear
                  them;—how, in the silence and darkness of that night, he had vowed to go forth
                  from home and friends, not again to return, till with triumph he could point to a
                     <emph>father's</emph> unsullied honor. All this, and more,<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000071"/> did the almost prophetic voice of the young man
                  pour into the ear of his astonished listener.</p>
               <p>"I never knew before," said Joseph Atherton, wiping his eye, "that you felt so
                  deeply your unknown parentage, or that there were hearts depraved enough to taunt
                  you with it. I wouldn't be afraid to stake my right arm that your parents were
                  good and honorable, though perhaps poor."</p>
               <p>"On your account, my more than father," replied the young man, "I have suffered in
                  silence the stigma on my name. Do you remember, years ago, the term 'pauper
                  foundling,' applied to me by——?"</p>
               <p>"By that infernal old woman, Mark's wife," interrupted Joseph Atherton
                  indignantly,—"Yes, I do; but Lonny, boy, you don't care for her, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I care for her, because she expresses the sentiments of a certain portion of
                  society; and more than all, I care for her, because she is Nettie's mother."</p>
               <p>The flush on Lonny's face grew deeper, and his voice more tremulous as he said
                  this.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't blame you a mite for loving Nettie," said Uncle Joseph; "but as for
                  her mother, she's a great ugly——."</p>
               <p>"Don't I beseech you, Uncle Joseph," pleaded the young man, "as Nettie's mother,
                  her name is sacred to me."</p>
               <p>"You are the strangest fellow I ever saw, Lonny; but you are the best too; so I
                  won't offend you if I can help it; but you'll get over this bad feeling pretty
                  soon, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Never, Uncle Joseph, till I can hear my name without a blush," replied Lonny,
                  decidedly. "This very day, with your blessing, I go to rescue my mother's, fame
                  from worse than oblivion."</p>
               <p>"Why! what <emph>do</emph> you mean to do, Lonny?" asked Uncle Joseph with
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>"First, find, if possible, some trace of my grandfather's family."</p>
               <p>"How will you do that?"</p>
               <p>"I scarcely know myself. I was old enough when he died to have some indistinct
                  recollection of the places where we wandered. If I could get started right, I
                  think I could retrace many of them."</p>
               <p>Joseph Atherton gazed with intense affection into the face before him.</p>
               <p>"Lonny," said he with a choking voice, "is it necessary for your happiness to do
                  this?"</p>
               <p>"Believe me, beloved father, that you have been to me, if I keep not this promise
                  to her whose lonely grave I seek, my life will be but a broken, shattered ruin,"
                  replied the young man with deep emotion.</p>
               <p>"Then may Heaven bless you, as I do," exclaimed Joseph Atherton, laying his hands
                  upon the head of the young man, who knelt before him: "Henny, wife, come here and
                  join your blessing to mine."</p>
               <p>Trembling, the good woman obeyed. "As you have blessed our hearts, my son," she
                  murmured, "so may you be blessed in this, your true and noble mission. God
                     <emph>will</emph> prosper thee; for 'when were the righteous ever
                  forsaken?'"</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7276-00000072"/>
               <p>Simple, sublime faith! deep down into the troubled heart before her it sank, while
                  o'er them all an angel face bent its enraptured gaze, and in breathless whispers,
                  crowned the blessing with a <emph>mother's</emph> love.</p>
               <p>To the deserted hut, from which, years before, he had seen the lifeless form of
                  his grandfather carried to its last rest, Lonny bent his solitary steps. No longer
                  the dirty, ragged boy that last had trod those fields;—no longer the frightful
                  object that, behind the very stone where he now stopped to rest, had called forth
                  such gibes and jeers from rude boys;—no longer the needy recipient of that
                  sympathy, which even now floated around the spot in the soft, silvery tones of a
                  musical voice; no: with the bloom of health upon his cheek, the glance of the
                  mind's intelligence in his eye, the strength and beauty of manhood in his form,
                  Lonny sat, where once he had crouched in fear and shame. He heeded not the passing
                  moments, as swiftly into hours they formed before him; back, far back his vision
                  swept,—to the poor, helpless being whose flickering life went out in yonder
                  hovel,—to the desolate, cheerless dearth of his own boyhood,—to the insults and
                  abuses he then suffered;—but here the dark waves of memory were stayed by a form
                  of angelic beauty, and a voice whose thrilling sweetness yet lingered in his soul.
                  Again he saw the golden curls, which, like a crown of glory, encircled that fair
                  head;—again he felt the soft pressure of a tiny hand, as, with words of tender
                  sympathy, she first woke his dormant spirit.</p>
               <p>It was not all a dream—this vision of the past, for as the young man raised his
                  head, she, the idealization of his thoughts,—the inspiration of his hopes, stood
                  before him.</p>
               <p>All the idolatry of his heart seemed concentrated in the yearning tenderness with
                  which he breathed her name, as, forgetful of every thing save her presence, he
                  caught her wildly to his heart. Quickly the blushing girl withdrew from his
                  embrace; but her chidings were gentle, for she saw the deep shadow of his spirit's
                  strife.</p>
               <p>"Come, sit by me, Nettie," said he, "here where first you became the light of my
                  life. Nay, you need fear no more rudeness," he added, as a timid blush rose to her
                  cheek; "I am master of myself now. Heaven has sent you here, Nettie, in this my
                  hour of darkness; I cannot doubt that."</p>
               <p>"I often walk this way," she replied; "but what brought you here—and in this dark
                  mood too?"</p>
               <p>"Nettie, I must not burden your young heart with my grief. I came here to look
                  once more upon the scenes of my unhappy boyhood,—upon this spot, where first your
                  angel face daguerreotyped itself upon the darkness of my soul. I dared not seek
                  you, Nettie; I know but too well the gulf that lies between us. But now that I
                  leave you, perhaps for ever,—perhaps to return long hence and find you happy in
                  another's love, I bless God that this moment of joy is given me."</p>
               <p>"Lonny, of what do you speak?" asked Nettie with a trembling voice; "where are you
                  going?"</p>
               <p>"To seek that, without which, neither talents,<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000073"/> learning, nor worth, can avail aught in this
                  world," he replied bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Explain yourself, Lonny; I do not understand you."</p>
               <p>He looked into the clear blue eyes raised to his, and an expression of anguish
                  passed over his face.</p>
               <p>"Nettie," said he, "has not your mother taught you to regard me as a poor outcast,
                  unworthy even a common friendship?"</p>
               <p>"My mother has her prejudices," replied the fair girl; "but there are others,
                  Lonny, who see nothing in you but what you are—a noble, true-hearted man."</p>
               <p>"Bless you for those words, Nettie; they strengthen me—but, sweet comforter that
                  you are, you little know the curse with which the world brands me."</p>
               <p>"Why care for the world, Lonny, when friends love and appreciate you?"</p>
               <p>"Why—indeed!" he repeated with a quivering lip. "Can I sit calmly, think you, and
                  hear a mother's name coupled with the most insulting epithets? Can I meet the look
                  of scorn, which seems almost to deny my humanity? Above all, can I live on,
                  unblessed by a love which I dare not ask? No, Nettie; either I trace a mother's
                  unblemished name, or you never see me again."</p>
               <p>With a holy, beautiful smile, the maiden laid her small white hand within
                  his,—</p>
               <p>"Then, Lonny, hear me," she murmured, "you may not go hence, till with this hand I
                  pledge you the heart that has long been yours."</p>
               <p>"Miserable pauper! vile excrescence! beggar's foundling! how dare you insult my
                  daughter with your contaminating touch!" Mrs. Mark Atherton shrieked, as she
                  caught the arm of the terrified girl,—"poor, degraded thing!" said she, pushing
                  her away, "go to your father's house, and hide your infamy in your own room,—and
                  you, lowest of the vile, how shall I find language to express my loathing of
                  you,—prowling around here to entice a weak girl to your polluted arms: precious
                  son of your mother are you! begone, dog! lest in my vengeance I tear your very
                  eyes from their sockets."</p>
               <p>Lonny stood with folded arms during this storm of passion, which burst so suddenly
                  upon his blissful dream. He caught Nettie's glance of unutterable love, as she
                  fled in terror from the fury of her mother, and his heart felt strong within
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Madam," said he calmly, "you are the mother of that pure being—else I would
                  answer you as you deserve; but for her sake I forbear. Yet let me tell you, that
                  the day may come—yes, <emph>will</emph> come, when the words you have now uttered,
                  will cause you far more pain than they now cause me."</p>
               <p>Before she could reply, he had gone from her sight.</p>

               <p>"HAS he come, mother?"</p>
               <p>"No, darling, he has not been here yet."</p>
               <p>The sick girl turned wearily on her couch,—"Oh, if he only knew!" she murmured,
                  "how I long to tell him the forgiveness there is in my heart! Why! Oh, why will he
                  not come!"</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Agnes, dear," said her mother, gently bathing the fevered brow, and
                  smoothing back the beautiful hair from her temples; "he has doubtless been called
                  away on business, or he would have answered your summons before now; I dare say he
                  will be here soon."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that must be it, mother; how kind you are to think so, and how strange that
                     <emph>I</emph> should have thought he did not want to come," and the fair
                  patient, with a sigh of relief, yielded to the soporific influence, and soon fell
                  into a deep, sweet sleep.</p>
               <p>Long did that widowed mother gaze into the face of the beautiful sleeper, now her
                  only earthly treasure. The marble brow, the pallid lip, the thin white hand, told
                  but too plainly their tale of sorrow. Her child was dying of a broken heart; and
                  she, who would gladly give her own life for the beloved one, must look on in
                  helpless agony, while her bright star fades—fades away from her sight. Ah! well
                  for thee, afflicted one, that thou leanest not on an arm of flesh,—that, even in
                  this hour, the prayer of faith, "though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him," is
                  on thy lips; else what could break the midnight darkness of thy soul, when this,
                  thy light, is gone from thee.</p>
               <p>With a look of calm determination, Mrs. Blair left, with noiseless steps, the
                  chamber of sickness, and bidding an attendant watch at the door till her return,
                  she set forth, oh what she feared might be her fruitless errand. She had deplored,
                  when too late, the infatuation of her daughter for one whom neither her taste nor
                  judgment approved. But as at Judge Morton's, where only the higher class were
                  admitted, Agnes first met Albert Atherton, she hoped he might prove more worthy
                  than to her he seemed. Now, however, the sad, convincing evidence of his baseness
                  was in the wasted form and sunken eye of her child—her beautiful one, whom he had
                  cruelly deserted. For days and weeks they had sent in vain for some explanation of
                  his strange conduct, till, crushing every feeling of pride in the mother's heart,
                  Mrs. Blair resolved to solve the dreadful mystery under which Agnes was fast
                     sinking.<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7276-00000075"/> This, then, was her
                  mission, as she so quickly threaded the streets which led to Judge Morton's
                  mansion.</p>
               <p>"Not at home," was the reply to her inquiry for Mr. Atherton, and slipping a note
                  in the servant's hand, she turned with a heavy heart to retrace her steps, just as
                  a travelling carriage drew up before the door. She could not pass it without
                  observing those within, when something in the face of one of them arrested her
                  attention.</p>
               <p>"The likeness is very remarkable," said she to herself, "it looks as she did the
                  last time I saw her."</p>
               <p>Richard Morton's cheerful voice recalled her, as he exclaimed, "Mrs. Blair, I am
                  happy to see you; how is your daughter?"</p>
               <p>"She is very ill, sir, very ill indeed," was her reply.</p>
               <p>"Ill!" he repeated; "Agnes ill! I did not know it; how long has she been so?"</p>
               <p>"Several weeks," said Mrs. Blair; then drawing nearer, she added in a low
                  voice,—"She is dying, Mr. Morton, dying for one all unworthy her thoughts."</p>
               <p>"You shock me beyond measure, Mrs. Blair," he replied, "can it be possible that
                  Albert has"—</p>
               <p>"Your company are waiting for you," interrupted Mrs. Blair, "come over and see
                  her; it would comfort her much."</p>
               <p>"I will come this very night," said he, as he turned away.</p>
               <p>True to his appointment, Richard Morton sat that night within the darkened
                  chamber, and saw the blight which had fallen upon a happy life. Oh, how did he
                  curse that spirit of worldliness, which, in its eager strife for empty honors,
                  could ruthlessly hurl such gems from its path.</p>
               <p>"If Albert would only come to me," the sweet sufferer said to him, "I would tell
                  him how his poor Agnes prays daily and nightly for his happiness,—how from her
                  heart she forgives and blesses him."</p>
               <p>"He is unworthy of your love, Agnes," he began; but she waved her hand,—that
                  transparent hand, to hush him,—</p>
               <p>"Say not so, Richard," she cried, "it is I who am unworthy; how <emph>could</emph>
                  he, so noble and gifted, love a poor girl like me?"</p>
               <p>Richard would not add to the pangs of that wounded spirit, by speaking of the
                  sordid selfishness—the unscrupulous villany, of one she worshipped as "noble and
                  gifted." He resolved, however, as he bent his steps homeward that evening, that
                  the heiress, at whose shrine Albert Atherton would lay such a costly sacrifice,
                  should, in that pale, spiritual face, learn his deep duplicity. The next day,
                  therefore, Richard again stood by Agnes's bedside; but he came not alone. She, the
                  innocent cause of the misery before her, looked with pity and astonishment at the
                  fearful wreck of the beautiful temple she had once so much admired. Gently she
                  clasped the wasted hand within her own, and with purest sympathy met the
                  earnest,—almost agonizing gaze of the lovely girl.</p>
               <p>"What has wrought this change?" said she; "the last time I saw you, Miss Blair,
                  you looked the very picture of health."</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7276-00000076"/>
               <p>Agnes well remembered the time,—"So I was, till then," she replied feebly, while
                  her lip quivered with emotion.</p>
               <p>Miss Mowbray's interest was instantly aroused; she had always connected that
                  fainting fit with the words she saw Albert Atherton then whisper in the fair
                  girl's ear; but he had so strenuously denied it since, that she dismissed it from
                  her thoughts; now, however, to return, with fourfold conviction.</p>
               <p>"And what was there then," she asked, "to cause you such sickness and
                  suffering?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, not to you!—not to you!" cried Agnes, covering her eyes, as if to shut out
                  some terrible vision. "<emph>You</emph> must never know."</p>
               <p>"I would not force your confidence, my dear girl," said Miss Mowbray in gentle
                  tones; "I am a stronger, I know; yet my heart yearns to comfort you if I can."</p>
               <p>"It is not that," murmured the sufferer, "you are no stranger to me, though we
                  have met but once; but <emph>he</emph> loves you—and—and—he is worthy of you."</p>
               <p>With a suppressed groan, Agnes sank back on her pillow, and a deathly pallor
                  spread over her face.</p>
               <p>"Quick—quick!"—exclaimed Miss Mowbray, "she has fainted! What does this all
                  mean?"</p>
               <p>"The sight of you has overcome her," said Mrs. Blair, as she chafed the cold hands
                  and temples of the unconscious girl; "you were kind to come," she added, "but
                  perhaps, in her weak state, it would be better that she should not see you when
                  she revives."</p>
               <p>"I do not understand it at all," said Miss Mowbray, rising to leave, "but with
                  your permission I will call again to-morrow. Agnes evidently labors under some
                  strange misapprehension with regard to me, which must be removed at once."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blair threw a quick, searching glance at the young lady, but at that moment a
                  deep sigh, as from the spirit's sad return, escaped from Agnes's lips, and Miss
                  Mowbray silently withdrew.</p>
               <p>"Where are they?" whispered Agnes, with the first returning consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Who? darling."</p>
               <p>"Why, Albert and—and—I can't remember her name."</p>
               <p>"You are dreaming, love; there is no one here but me."</p>
               <p>"Am I dreaming, mother? I thought Albert stood here by my bed, and she with those
                  great black eyes, and I thought I was going to marry them. Is it <emph>all</emph>
                  a dream, mother?" murmured the poor girl, fixing her eye with pleading earnestness
                  upon the face bent over her.</p>
               <p>"You are so weak, darling, you have strange fancies. No one has been here but
                  Richard Morton and Miss Mowbray; and Richard says that Albert has returned, and
                  will surely come to see you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Did he say that, mother?" cried Agnes, springing up with unnatural strength,—"did
                  he say he would surely come? Then you were right, dear mother, and I—Oh! how I
                  have wronged my noble Albert!"</p>
               <p>"Be calm, my child," exclaimed Mrs. Blair, frightened<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000077"/> ened at the effect of her imprudent remark;
                  "something may yet detain him; or perhaps you are not mistaken in thinking that he
                  does not wish to come. You must try to prepare your mind for whatever awaits you,
                  my daughter."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother, I will; but tell me once more, that he will come,—that I shall see
                  him again;" and again that imploring look overcame the mother's judgment and
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"You shall see him to-morrow, darling," she said caressingly; "but my precious one
                  must love her mother a little, and not grieve so about a faithless lover."</p>
               <p>"My mother knows that I love her better than any thing on earth, except"—Agnes
                  hesitated,—</p>
               <p>"Except this young man, who robs me of my Agnes' heart, and then casts it aside,
                  as of little worth," Mrs. Blair added reproachfully.</p>
               <p>Hope lent new strength to the frail form, new brilliancy to the faded eye of the
                  lovely invalid. Like some pure, embodied spirit, Agnes looked, enshrouded in her
                  simple white wrapper, her soft hair parted smoothly over her brow, and her fair
                  face rivalling the snowy whiteness of the pillows that supported her.</p>
               <p>Through the long watches of the night she had lain, outwardly calm and still as in
                  repose; but the soul's wild tumult, as by turns the phantoms of hope and fear
                  seized their victim, none save the ever faithful Eye might know. But the morning's
                  bright beams brought only the sweet vision of hope, infusing its life into her
                  languid frame. Beautiful as the lily, fit emblem of her purity and fragility,
                  Agnes lay, counting each slow hour, as on it moved, unmindful of the trembling
                  joy, or bitter disappointment which marked its course. Still she watched on, for
                  when was woman's faith e'er known to fail? She was sure Richard Morton must be
                  mistaken in saying Albert had returned; perhaps his mother, whom he loved so well,
                  was sick,—perhaps, oh, why had she not thought of that before! perhaps
                     <emph>he</emph> was ill—as ill as herself may be, and no friend near to love
                  and care for him. In an instant the terrible thought took possession of her
                  diseased imagination;—he was dying—she knew it,—and to him she would fly, were it
                  only to breathe her life out with his. With supernatural strength and agility she
                  sprang from her couch, robed herself as for a walk, and closely veiled, passed
                  with silent steps down the stairs, out at the door, and through streets, she
                  heeded not where. On she flew, in her vague, mad pursuit; reason could not guide
                  her, for it had left its helm. Nature, thus o'er-burdened, could not long sustain
                  the fearful odds. Suddenly she stood, transfixed,—her heart wildly leaping its
                  imprisoned walls. Near her, almost near enough to touch her garments,
                     <emph>he</emph> passed! he, whom in her madness she sought, and by his side
                  those same black eyes that had haunted her dreams. With every sense painfully
                  tensed, she turned and followed quick upon their steps.</p>
               <p>"Let us go in and take an ice," said Albert to his<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000078"/> companion, as they paused before the window of a
                  large saloon.</p>
               <p>"Wait till Mr. Morton and my friend overtake us," she replied; "we have quite
                  outwalked them."</p>
               <p>They did not notice the muffled figure that crept so near them, or the hollow,
                  glassy eyes, that glared so through the thick veil upon them.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Atherton," said Miss Mowbray, as they seated themselves at a table, with
                  the cooling ice before them, "you have heard my opinion in this matter. Perhaps I
                  have spoken too freely, but if I am not deceived,"—</p>
               <p>"You are deceived, Miss Mowbray," eagerly interrupted the young man; "it is all a
                  trumped up tale. Agnes Blair never had any reason to think I loved her. And if she
                  was so consummately foolish as to fall in love with me, must I be blamed for
                  it?"</p>
               <p>A deep, unearthly groan caused both to start, while from his feet Albert Atherton
                  caught the insensible form of a female, as she sank there.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! it is Agnes Blair!" exclaimed Miss Mowbray, throwing aside the
                  thick veil.</p>
               <p>"A carriage: quick—quick!" shouted Richard Morton to one of the servants; and
                  almost as soon as spoken, a carriage awaited them; into which Albert, still
                  bearing his inanimate burden, stepped, followed by the young ladies with such
                  restoratives as they could command.</p>
               <p>"Now drive for your life," said Richard to the man, after he had given his
                  directions, "and I will be there with a physician as quick as you."</p>
               <p>Not a word was spoken, as over the still form which he clasped in his arms, Albert
                  Atherton bent a face as pale as her own. He knew his heartless words had killed
                  her, and as for a moment his selfish nature was stunned, he felt all his love for
                  that pure being revive with tenfold power. For he had loved her, more than his
                  sordid heart seemed capable of loving any thing but himself. Gently,—almost
                  tenderly, he carried her to the couch from which, one half hour before, she had
                  fled in the frenzy of despair, to die with him. Her mother's promise, "you shall
                  see him to-morrow, darling," had been, oh, how fearfully verified! She had seen
                  him in all the black deformity of his guilty heart, and her life was the
                  forfeit!</p>
               <p>But where, in this terrible moment, was she, whose vigilant care ever surrounded
                  this—the idol of her love? Deceived by her daughter's apparent calmness and
                  quietude, and attributing it to a firm reliance on her promise that she should see
                  Albert that day, Mrs. Blair resolved that she would go herself, and plead with the
                  young man to see Agnes once more, and end her suspense, though it should be by
                  confirming her worst fears. This, she judged, would be the wisest course for her
                  child, whose wounded pride, as she learned her lover's unfaithfulness from his own
                  lips, might serve to lessen the bitter pangs of disappointed affection. She had
                  left Agnes reposing quietly, as she thought, upon her couch, and with a faithful
                  promise from the servant, that she would on no account leave her, Mrs. Blair set
                  forth to accomplish her painful task. She could not<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000079"/> find him she sought, and determined to make yet
                  another effort, when she had looked in again upon Agnes, she reached her own door,
                  to find it surrounded by terror-stricken faces, who involuntarily shrank back as
                  she approached. With a fearful cry, she rushed to her daughter's room. Oh! who
                  shall picture the scene of woe that met that mother's frantic gaze! Agnes, with
                  the pale hue of death upon her cheek, lay still and motionless, her eyes closed as
                  in sleep, but with an expression of anguish which seemed frozen upon her beautiful
                  features. Supporting the pillows upon which her head rested, Albert Atherton sat
                  like one entranced, now for the first time in his life hearing the voice of
                  conscience, as in sepulchral tones it whispered—"Murderer! murderer!" Kneeling
                  around the lifeless form, with suppressed sobs, were those who had borne her
                  thither, while, with an expression of deepest anxiety and sorrow, the kind
                  physician bent tearfully over the unconscious one.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! she is dead!" shrieked the mother, throwing herself upon the
                  couch.</p>
               <p>"My dear Mrs. Blair," said the physician, tenderly drawing her away, "Agnes is not
                  dead, though I fear she is past all human aid. See, she breathes, though faintly,
                  and I can perceive a little fluttering at her pulse."</p>
               <p>"Then she <emph>will</emph> live, doctor! Oh, say that she will live!" Mrs. Blair
                  cried eagerly, lifting her anguished face to his.</p>
               <p>"Would to Heaven I could say so!" exclaimed he, wiping his eye, "but her life is
                  in the hands of One who doeth all things well. Can you not trust in Him, Mrs.
                  Blair?"</p>
               <p>The heart of the <emph>Christian</emph> triumphed over the mother, as she
                  murmured,—"I can—I do; but oh, how heavily has His hand fallen upon me!"</p>
               <p>"Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth," said a low, sweet voice near her; and Mrs.
                  Blair looked quickly into the upturned face so full of sympathy.</p>
               <p>"'Tis my sister's self that speaks through you," said she. "In this dark hour I
                  feel her spirit near. But oh, Agnes! my only one!" she cried in piteous tones,
                  "how can I live in this desolate world without thee, the light of my life!"</p>
               <p>None essayed to stay the mighty flood of grief which burst from her o'ercharged
                  heart, as, sinking before her earthly all, the agonized mother bowed and
                  wept;—wept, till it seemed that the fountains of life must be dried within her.
                  Then they laid her, weak and helpless almost as her child, where her gaze could
                  rest on the beloved face.</p>
               <p>For hours, in that still, deathlike trance, Agnes lay,—all their efforts could not
                  win back the broken spirit,—but as the silver cord loosened, and brighter its
                  wings plumed for upward flight, a smile of immortal beauty and glory chased the
                  grief from those rigid features.</p>
               <p>"The change is approaching," whispered the physician, and around her they
                  stood,—the heart-stricken mother, the weeping friends, and <emph>he</emph>—oh, by
                  what name<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7276-00000080"/> should he be called!—All
                  gazed in speechless sorrow, as the dread messenger laid his cold hand upon his
                  prize. His icy touch seemed to arouse the dying one; for her eyes unclosed, and
                  with deep tenderness rested on the dear familiar face of her childhood's love. Joy
                  unspeakable! light ineffable shone in those blue orbs, in this last farewell.</p>
               <p>"Speak to me, Agnes: say that you forgive me," said a voice whose tones of subdued
                  agony had power, even then, to reach her heart.</p>
               <p>The palsied tongue refused to give the heart's utterance, but she turned upon him
                  a look, such as angels might wear,—a look of pity and forgiving love, and then she
                  gently passed away.</p>
               <p>"Young man, look upon your work!" solemnly exclaimed the physician, pointing to
                  the lifeless clay. But Albert Atherton had fled;—fled, he knew not, cared not
                  where, so that the terrible voice within should be stilled.</p>

               <p>THE tolling bell, the sable pall, the slow and mournful tread of death's pale,
                  weeping followers, though scarce heeded in the noisy tumult of city life, told of
                  one more treasure laid in earth's bosom. No pomp or pageant marked the sad
                  funereal train which bore to her last, long home, the marble form of Agnes Blair.
                  Calmly and peacefully they laid her down in her cold sleep,—the last of earth's
                  hopes to the smitten one who bent in silent anguish over the narrow bed. Widowed
                  and childless now, she must tread alone the weary path which will lead her here at
                  last—here, where now she would fain lay her head and be at rest. Yet not alone,
                  for He in whom her heart has ever rested, will not suffer his chosen one to be
                  wholly forsaken. He will yet mingle many drops of gladness in her cup of
                  sorrow.</p>
               <p>Back to her desolate home she turned,—desolate, though voices of sympathy and
                  friendship were there,—<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7276-00000081"/> desolate, for
                  now had its light gone out for ever. Friends gathered around the sorrowing mother,
                  for Agnes had been a universal favorite, and the news of her sudden, untimely
                  death came with startling effect to many, who had but recently seen her in all her
                  youthful bloom and beauty. But no voice came with such soothing power to the
                  bereaved heart, as those soft, gentle tones, which first fell on her ear over
                  Agnes' dying form. Whether it was her age, so nearly that of Agnes, or her perfect
                  loveliness, in which the fond mother fancied a resemblance to her lost child, Mrs.
                  Blair never seemed so calm and happy, as when Miss Singleton was by her side. A
                  secret sympathy seemed to have sprung up between the motherless and childless one,
                  as day after day the fair girl sought to cheer the mourner's home.</p>
               <p>Miss Mowbray and her friend had left the quiet enjoyment of Willow Glen, and
                  returned to the city, at Judge Morton's request, to await his return from a
                  distant town, whither he had traced, as he hoped, the heiress' much sought-for
                  relatives. Thus had she been, unwittingly, the cause of hastening poor Agnes'
                  tragic fate, by revealing the base character of her false lover. Miss Mowbray was
                  shocked and grieved by the sad denouement in which she had borne an innocent part,
                  and deeply did she loathe the wretch who had brought such woe and desolation into
                  a happy home. But soon other thoughts claimed her attention, though not to the
                  exclusion of every kindness which wealth and affection could bestow on the lonely
                  widow.</p>
               <p>Judge Morton returned, and brought intelligence that gave some faint hope, that
                  their search might yet be rewarded. He had, as he said, traced all the Barn-well
                  family (to which Mrs. Mowbray belonged) to their graves, except one. Jane
                  Barnwell, the favorite sister of hers who had gone abroad, had left home in great
                  depression of spirits, immediately after the death of the old people, and the sale
                  of the homestead, and had never been heard from since, save through rumor, which
                  said that she had supported herself by teaching in the city. There was therefore a
                  possibility that she might be still living, somewhere in Boston, and if so, they
                  would most assuredly find her. Judge Morton saw not,—for he seldom noticed
                  her,—the fluctuating cheek, the parted lips, the eager, devouring glance of Miss
                  Mowbray's companion, as she listened in breathless excitement to his recital of
                  his efforts and their results. He did not see—what Richard Morton, whose eyes were
                  ever upon her, saw with inexpressible surprise, that the information affected her
                  far more strongly than the heiress. Had Richard been less noble, he might have
                  attributed it to the fear of being supplanted in the wealthy girl's favor; but no
                  such selfish feeling could be traced in her beautiful face, as, forgetful even of
                  his presence, she threw her arms around her friend, earnestly exclaiming,—"Thank
                  God, <emph>one</emph> may yet be found."</p>
               <p>"You seem strangely interested in your friend's success," said Richard to her, as
                  they sat alone that evening.</p>

               <p>"Do I?" she quickly asked, with a conscious blush; "but why should I not?" she
                  added, "her interests are as dear to me as my own. We have been like sisters
                  always."</p>
               <p>"The world, that does not know you as I do," said Richard, with a smile, "might
                  impute other motives."</p>
               <p>"What, pray?" she asked with surprise.</p>
               <p>"Such, perhaps, as a too eager desire to retain your present favored position, as
                  Miss Mowbray's dear and confidential friend, which the discovery of her kindred
                  might affect."</p>
               <p>Richard Morton repented his words ere they were spoken, for the deep flush which
                  had at first risen to the young girl's brow, gave place to an expression of pain,
                  such as a sensitive nature like hers would feel when deeply wounded.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible," she exclaimed, and there was more of grief than indignation
                  in her voice,—"can it be possible that there are any among <emph>your</emph>
                  acquaintances, Mr. Morton, that look upon me as so heartless—so degraded?"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, my dear Miss Singleton," cried he, warmly, "that I have caused you
                  such a pang. I did not mean that <emph>I</emph>—that any of my friends, could
                  think thus of you."</p>
               <p>"To whom then did you allude?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I meant only the world,—those who look upon the surface of things,—those who
                  could not see the beautiful, hidden life there is in you."</p>
               <p>Richard stopped, and a crimson spot burned in the fair girl's cheek, as she
                  replied—</p>
               <p>"And what care I for the world! A homeless, dependent one, their smiles are not
                  for me. Thank God, for once they worship worth, when they pay their tribute to my
                  dear, beautiful friend, Miss Mowbray."</p>
               <p>"Did I but dare," said Richard, and his low, deep tones were music to the ear that
                  listened,—"I could tell you of one who, in the 'homeless, dependent one,' sees
                  more beauty, more worth, more priceless virtue, than he had ever thought to find
                  on earth. Pardon me, Miss Singleton," he added, as she withdrew the hand he
                  attempted to take, "I did not mean thus to betray myself, till I could read in
                  your eyes some hope that I had not loved in vain,—that my heart's wild pleadings
                  met there their silent response. But now that you know all, tell me if I may yet
                  hope to win that, without which the world is naught to me; or must my dream of joy
                  end only in a bitter awakening?"</p>
               <p>He paused, and with downcast eye and trembling voice the maiden rejoined,—</p>
               <p>"I would you had not spoken thus to me, Mr. Morton; though in my heart I thank you
                  for your noble forgetfulness of the wide distinction there is in our social
                  positions, and for the honor you would confer upon me;but—"</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay!" cried he earnestly, "I cannot permit you to proceed further upon such
                  a false plea. I am rather seeking than conferring honor. But do not, I entreat
                  you, speak of position, or honor now; my heart<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000083"/> asks but one question, and in your reply the
                  happiness of my life is staked;—can its deep devotion hope for reward—the reward
                  even of your own priceless love?"</p>
               <p>The fair girl raised her eyes, suffused with tears, to the manly face bent so
                  eagerly forward for her reply.</p>
               <p>"You bid me not to speak of honor, or position," said she; "but do you not forget
                  the duties you owe your family and friends, when you thus seek the love of a poor,
                  friendless, unportioned orphan like me?"</p>
               <p>"I owe no duties," said he, "that call for the sacrifice of all my heart's dearest
                  hopes."</p>
               <p>"But your parents," she urged, "you know they have high expectations for you,
                  their only son and heir."</p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Singleton," exclaimed Richard impatiently, "I beg you will not
                  tantalize me more. Whatever my parents' expectations may be,—whatever the world
                  may say, or think, I care not—I ask only your love, and the pledge of this dear
                  hand through life, and my happiness is secured."</p>
               <p>"Your noble offer deserves a truthful answer, and it shall receive such," said the
                  maiden, while a deep glow of happiness spread over her burning cheeks, as she
                  frankly extended her hand.</p>
               <p>The smile of perfect confidence and joy which irradiated their faces, as an hour
                  later they parted, told what that answer had been.</p>
               <p>In her silent chamber, where so lately Death had left his cold imprint, and where
                  yet his dread presence seemed to linger, Mrs. Blair sat in deep meditation. Hers
                  had been a life of anxiety and toil; but how light the labor, how sweet the
                  solicitude, whose secret spring was love,—whose reward the happy smiles of
                  conjugal and filial tenderness. One by one her treasures had been recalled by
                  their Giver, and, bowing her head submissively to the sad decree, she still
                  thanked God for what remained, and labored on. Now, <emph>all</emph> was gone, her
                  life aimless, and but for her faith in him who chastened, <emph>hopeless.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, for a long time she sat, her face buried in her hands, while she reviewed
                  the way through which she had been led.</p>
               <p>"Why should I give any thought to the future?" said she, rising and ringing the
                  bell; "the little that will carry me to my grave will be provided."</p>
               <p>Becky," said she, as her summons was answered by a colored servant, "come in; I
                  must have some talk with you this morning. You have been a kind and faithful
                  servant to me and mine for many years"—she began, but tears choked her
                  utterance.</p>
               <p>"Dat's nuffin', missus," said Becky, rolling her eyes and moving uneasily at what
                  she feared was coming; "didn't your fader—good ole massa—keep me from sumthin'
                  nuff sight worse'n death?"</p>
               <p>"He saved you from being sold as a slave I know," Mrs. Blair replied, "but that
                  didn't oblige you to labor for us always. You have, as I said before, been kind
                  and faithful to those who are gone, and nothing but necessity would compel me to
                  part from you. But I<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7276-00000084"/> have no longer any
                  home to offer you. All that I have must be sold, to pay the debts I have
                  incurred"—she could not add—"for Agnes," though every thing <emph>had</emph> been
                  pledged to secure comforts and luxuries for the beloved one.</p>
               <p>Becky's dark form vanished as Mrs. Blair ceased speaking, but she quickly
                  returned, and with a low chuckle, threw a heavy bag into her mistress's lap.</p>
               <p>"D'ye s'pose," said she, "dis nig wanted all dis money to cover her wool; Lor, I
                  couldn't do nuffin' wid it, so I puts it away and ses 'maybe some time 'twon't be
                  jes 'venient for missus to send to de bank, an den here 'tis."</p>
               <p>"What's all this,—what do you mean, Becky?" exclaimed Mrs. Blair with
                  astonishment, as she looked at the contents of the bag.</p>
               <p>"Jes your money, missus, dat's all,—he—he," laughed Becky.</p>
               <p>Tears sprang into the widow's eyes, and her lip quivered as she handed back the
                  treasure.</p>
               <p>"Noble creature!" she exclaimed,—"you have well crowned your faithfulness;—no, I
                  cannot take it, Becky, I do not need it so much as you, now that you must find
                  your home among strangers; but I shall never forget your generous heart,
                  Becky."</p>
               <p>"Den 'tant worth nuffin' 'tall;" cried Becky, throwing the money upon the floor in
                  her grief, "'cause I'd jes die 'fore I'd leave you, missus."</p>
               <p>"You distress me; indeed you do, Becky," said Mrs. Blair. "Heaven knows I would
                  not part with you, the last of my father's household, if it could be helped; but,
                  Becky, this home is mine no longer,—I have nothing, literally nothing, in this
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Can't help dat," muttered Becky, as she hastened to the door to answer the bell
                  which had twice rung, leaving the money still on the floor, "dis chile aint gwine
                  no how."</p>
               <p>"Here then is the secret of Becky's housekeeping," thought Mrs. Blair; "I've often
                  wondered how she could manage to make things last so long, and keep such a nice
                  table too. What a noble, unselfish heart is hidden under that dark skin!"</p>
               <p>"The young ladies is below, missus."</p>
               <p>"Stop, Becky," cried Mrs. Blair, as the ebony face disappeared as soon as her
                  message was delivered. But Becky had gone to her loft, to constitute herself a
                  committee of ways and means for the future, into which she had but just gained a
                  true glimpse.</p>
               <p>"You find me unusually sad this morning," said Mrs. Blair, after she had greeted
                  her young guests, now her constant daily visitors; "but it is a sadness not
                  unmixed with pleasure."</p>
               <p>"What is it, my dear Mrs. Blair?" asked Miss Singleton, taking her usual place at
                  the widow's side, and gently laying her hand upon her arm; "I hope nothing serious
                  has occurred to sadden you."</p>
               <p>"Nothing more, dear girl, than the associations which would naturally arise in
                  preparing to leave a house where I have enjoyed, as well as suffered, much."</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7276-00000085"/>
               <p>"But why <emph>do</emph> you leave it? is it too lonely for you here?"</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> lonely; very," replied Mrs. Blair, evasively; "now that there
                  is no one left but me, this house is quite too large."</p>
               <p>"May I ask your plans for the future," said the young lady, "our deep interest in
                  your happiness will, I know, excuse my inquisitiveness."</p>
               <p>"I have already had sufficient proof of your friendship, my dear girls, to justify
                  any confidence you may ask. My plans are scarcely defined as yet. I wish first of
                  all to provide a good home for my faithful colored servant, who has lived both in
                  my father's house and my own, many years, and whose devotion and fidelity cannot
                  be surpassed."</p>
               <p>"Why not retain her with you?" asked Miss Mowbray.</p>
               <p>"I cannot—she can no longer serve me when I go from here."</p>
               <p>"She is just such a person as I should like," said the heiress, exchanging glances
                  with her friend; "we will take her and see that she is always well cared for."</p>
               <p>"You cannot think what a load you have removed from my mind," said Mrs. Blair,
                  gratefully; "now I shall have only myself to look after."</p>
               <p>"And you—where do you propose to go?" The question was asked in sad, gentle tones,
                  while the speaker's dark eyes rested tenderly upon her troubled face.</p>
               <p>"I would, if possible," said she, "revisit the scenes of my childhood's happy
                  hours. Though no kindred are there—though none would recognize me now, it would
                  comfort me to look once more upon my parents' graves and the dear home where I
                  parted from my soul's companion—my darling sister. Perhaps too I might be able to
                  support myself there among these cherished associations."</p>
               <p>This was the first allusion Mrs. Blair had ever made to her pecuniary
                  circumstances, and the young ladies delicately avoided noticing it, though it
                  dwelt in their hearts to be responded to hereafter.</p>
               <p>"How soon shall you leave us?" Miss Mowbray asked.</p>
               <p>"As soon as you can make arrangements for Becky's reception," Mrs. Blair replied
                  with a sad smile; "'twill be hard parting with the faithful creature, the only
                  remaining link of my father's household. Shall I call her and introduce her to her
                  new 'missus?'"</p>
               <p>"If you please," replied the heiress, "I should like to talk with her."</p>
               <p>"'Taint jes nuffin 'tall missus talks 'bout!" exclaimed Becky, indignantly, when
                  she was called into the parlor to be transferred to another's care; "I aint gwine
                  no how. Ole massa 'ats dead and gone 'ud jump rite out 'er his grave if I'se done
                  gone lef poor Miss Jane. No, dis nig stays here 'long o' missus."</p>
               <p>"But I am going away, Becky," remonstrated Mrs. Blair.</p>
               <p>"Den dis nig go too," was the quick rejoinder.</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7276-00000086"/>
               <p>"No, Becky," said Mrs. Blair decidedly, "you cannot go with me; you know I would
                  have you if I could."</p>
               <p>"O Lor'," cried Becky, putting her apron to her eyes and rocking back and forth in
                  her grief, "what ole massa Barnwell say ef he knowed his poor darter Jane gwine
                  way off 'lone."</p>
               <p>"What did you say?" cried the young ladies in one breath, catching hold of the
                  negro's arm.</p>
               <p>"Poor ole massa," she continued, moaning, without noticing them, "he done gone
                  long 'go when Miss Juley went off—dis nig'll be done gone too when young missus
                  goes."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Blair, for heaven's sake, tell me what she means," cried Miss Singleton,
                  pale and breathless with excitement; "she is talking of people <emph>we</emph>
                  would give worlds to discover."</p>
               <p>"She is speaking of my father," replied Mrs. Blair, scarcely less agitated; "why
                  do you wish to hear of him?"</p>
               <p>"But she called his name Barnwell," almost gasped the eager girl.</p>
               <p>"Certainly,—that was his name."</p>
               <p>"And yours?"</p>
               <p>"Jane Barnwell before I became Mrs. Blair."</p>
               <p>"Oh, blessed, joyful discovery!" exclaimed Miss Singleton, throwing her arms
                  around the astonished woman, "my own dear, dear aunt!"</p>
               <p>"But who are you?" cried Mrs. Blair, gazing with trembling eagerness in her
                  beautiful face, "sweet image of my precious, lost sister."</p>
               <p>"I am that sister's child," was the earnest answer, and they were folded to each
                  other's heart.</p>

               <p>"I HEAR wonderful accounts of the wealth of our new neighbor."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" was the Rev. Mrs. Flint's quiet response to her husband's remark.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" he repeated in the same tone, with a sneer; "one would think, Mrs.
                  Flint, that you felt very little interest in <emph>my</emph> people."</p>
               <p>"I am sure I do," she meekly replied; "it was only yesterday that I walked a mile
                  and a half to see the poor, sick woman whom you have not had time to visit yet,
                  though it is three or four weeks since she sent for you."</p>
               <p>"It is strange," said he, in no very <emph>ministerial</emph> tones, "how one's
                  early associations often affect the mind through life. You seem to take delight in
                  the company of the poor, Mary."</p>
               <p>"You and I know too well the sufferings and privations of poverty, not to feel a
                  deep sympathy for those who are afflicted <emph>now</emph> as we once were," Mrs.
                  Flint replied with feeling.</p>
               <p>"Why cannot you cease your allusions to those days, Mary; you are continually
                  harping upon them. But for <emph>my</emph> shrewd management we might have been as
                  poor as we were then." And Mr. Flint stroked his gray locks with
                  self-satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Every one cannot manage as shrewdly as you," his wife ventured to remark; "are
                  they therefore to blame for being poor?"</p>
               <p>"To blame! to be sure,—there is no need of any body being poor," said the
                  charitable minister; "extravagance and mismanagement are the only causes of
                  poverty, in my opinion."</p>
               <p>The good lady suppressed the inquiry that rose to her lips,—what extravagance
                  either his or her parents were guilty of, when struggling to support their
                  half-fed, half-clothed families? for she knew from experience what a scene of
                  bitter recrimination might ensue; so she very mildly remarked,</p>
               <p>"You were speaking of our new neighbors, at Woodbine Lodge; are they so very
                  rich?"</p>
               <p>"Neighbor, you mean," said he, correcting her; "the other persons there are only
                  dependents upon Miss Mowbray; she is said to be a millionnaire. Only think what an
                  addition to our society! I must call on her this very day."</p>
               <p>"Shall I go with you?" was the humble query.</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7276-00000088"/>
               <p>"Well,—I think not," he slowly articulated; "it is very important that the
                  heiress' first impressions should be right. I wish you would have my finest
                  wardrobe in readiness, for I must look my best."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," sighed the obedient wife as she left the room.</p>
               <p>Two hours later, the Rev. Mr. Flint, arrayed in snowy, spotless linen and shining
                  broadcloth, walked with stately, solemn steps up the broad avenue "which led" (in
                  his own words) "to fortune's door."</p>
               <p>A casual observer might, perhaps, have mistaken the air of extreme deference with
                  which he accosted the heiress, for humility; but not such was she whose dark eyes
                  looked so quickly into his narrow soul. "A mere dependent," as he deemed her, Miss
                  Singleton had ample time to read the pastor's character; for the few remarks, made
                  in a patronizing manner to her, were easily answered.</p>
               <p>"I regret extremely," said he, at the conclusion of his call, "that Mrs. Flint
                  could not have enjoyed this delightful visit with me."</p>
               <p>"Our regret is certainly equal to your own," politely replied Miss Mowbray; "when
                  shall we have the pleasure of seeing her here?"</p>
               <p>"Soon, I trust," he answered,—"her delicate health necessarily precludes her from
                  many of the pleasures as well as duties of pastoral life. She was too tenderly
                  brought up to endure much."</p>
               <p>"The fault, perhaps, of your American habits," said Miss Mowbray, with a smile;
                  "your ladies here, particularly ticularly among the wealthy, seem to look upon
                  outdoor exercise as masculine."</p>
               <p>"You must institute a reform among us, Miss Mowbray, not only in this, but in many
                  other things. Your wealth will give you great influence here."</p>
               <p>"I should be sorry indeed, were my influence to depend on the fortune I may
                  possess," Miss Mowbray replied, almost sternly. "I trust <emph>your</emph> people
                  are actuated by higher, holier motives."</p>
               <p>"Ah—yes—of course," he stammered; "but," looking at his watch, "I find I have
                  stayed beyond my time; so I must, though reluctantly, bid you good morning."</p>
               <p>"A young lady of some spirit," he soliloquized, going home,—"must look out how I
                  venture another opinion till I have studied her more carefully—hope she hasn't got
                  any of Thornton's fanatical notions in her head,—must take care and get into her
                  good graces before they do."</p>
               <p>"Now, I am going to sit in judgment on that man. Nay, dear aunt, put off that
                  sober look; I know you think the <emph>sacred cloth</emph> should be venerated,
                  and so do I, but not always what is under it. Unless I am greatly deceived, his
                  name well represents his nature too—<emph>flinty,</emph> cold,
                  unsympathizing,—sincere only in his devotion to mammon—there, what do you think of
                  that, for a picture of our minister!" said the laughing girl, enjoying the
                  half-horrified expression of the others' faces.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lucille dear, you should not carry your jokes too far," said the elder lady,
                  shaking her head.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7276-00000089"/>
               <p>"But I assure you, I am not joking, my good aunt," replied the other; "see if he
                  does not prove all I have said of him."</p>
               <p>"Lucille is piqued a little, because he did not notice her as much as he ought
                  to," smilingly added her companion; "it's all her own fault though, isn't it, Aunt
                  Blair?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; if she will persist in her disguise she must expect annoyances worse than
                  this, and trouble too, I fear," replied the lady appealed to;—"only think how long
                  it prevented my recognizing her."</p>
               <p>"Don't you see," cried Lucille, whom we will rightly designate in her
                     <emph>undisguised</emph> home circle, "don't you see how you are substantiating
                  my course? These very annoyances of which you warn me are what I seek to know—to
                  feel. I would be weighed in the balance of <emph>worth,</emph> not money!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear, you cannot expect that in this world."</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>do</emph> expect it, aunt; and in two cases, at least, I have not
                  been disappointed. You, for one, I shall always believe, loved me simply for
                  myself, before you knew, either that I was your niece, or rich."</p>
               <p>"Dear child, you can never realize how deep into my heart you sank, when like a
                  voice from heaven you breathed in my ear those comforting words over Agnes'
                  departing spirit. I felt your sainted mother's presence then, and from that moment
                  I loved you as my own child."</p>
               <p>"And yet we should have parted but for Becky's fortunate revelation."</p>
               <p>"For a time we might; but I have faith to believe that He who careth even for the
                  sparrows, would not have suffered our separation to be long."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how happy I have been since that morning," exclaimed Lucille, "to find that
                  you, whom I had learned to love so well, was my own dear mother's sister—and then
                  'twas such a pleasure to visit the place where she lived; where she first saw my
                  dear father and married him! And then too, since we came back, and bought this
                  beautiful place, I have felt proud and happy in my <emph>home</emph> with such a
                  mother and sister;" and the lovely girl wound an arm around each companion, and
                  imprinted a warm kiss upon their cheeks.</p>
               <p>"If you would but take me from the usurper's place, dear Lucille," said Maggie,
                  returning the caress, "you would be happier still."</p>
               <p>"No, believe me, not a hundredth part so happy," quickly replied Lucille; "but
                  you, dear Maggie, am I really sacrificing your happiness for my own?" and she
                  looked earnestly into her face.</p>
               <p>"It certainly cannot be any great sacrifice for me, who am nobody nor nothing, to
                  be flattered, caressed, and looked up to as a perfect oracle of fashion and
                  wisdom," was Maggie's laughing reply; "nevertheless, I will gladly doff my gay
                  plumes whenever the <emph>genuine</emph> bird will make herself known."</p>
               <p>"Not yet—not yet," cried Lucille, laughing and blushing, "lest the bird should
                  lose its mate."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7276-00000090"/>
               <p>"Aha," said Maggie, "that's it, is it? You think the golden cage would be too
                  dazzling, eh? Well, for my part, I should doubt the entity of such an one—he could
                  not be of mortal make. But seriously, Lucille dear, now that you and Richard
                  Morton <emph>are,</emph> despite his friends, betrothed to each other, why not
                  astound them all by declaring yourself the heiress they sought and he
                  avoided?"</p>
               <p>"Such a step would involve too many difficulties just now, and besides I have not
                  learned enough of the world yet,—this is to be my life-lesson, you know."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you will scarcely be able to pursue it at Mowbray Hall, where your lightest
                  word is law. Don't you almost long to go back again, Lucille?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say that I do," replied the blushing girl;—"life seems so real here—so
                  full of happiness—and yet we shall not return as lonely as we came," she
                  continued, pressing Mrs. Blair's hand; "I shall have a mother there still."</p>
               <p>"And nobody else?" asked Maggie, mischievously.</p>
               <p>Lucille's reply was prevented by the entrance of a visitor.</p>
               <p>"Miss Page, at your service, ladies," announced a small, grotesque-looking person,
                  approaching them with a puzzled air, not knowing which to address, as the hostess.
                  But with true native politeness she advanced to the elder, "I hope you are well,
                  ma'am," said she.</p>
               <p>"Quite so," replied Mrs. Blair; "shall I introduce to you Miss Mowbray, the lady,
                  I presume, for whom your call was intended?"</p>
               <p>"I did not know there were three ladies here," said Miss Page, bowing; "I am happy
                  to see them all."</p>
               <p>Her dress, which was the oddest compound of colors and fashions, had evidently
                  been put on with much care—over her shoulders, notwithstanding the heat of the
                  season, she had thrown an intensely red shawl; while, towering in pristine beauty
                  above all, was the steeple-crowned bonnet, unsullied as when her great-grandmother
                  received it from the artist's hands. Ah! Miss Priscilla, has mammon at last caught
                  you at its shrine, that you too must thus "look <emph>your</emph>" best before the
                  "millionnaire!"</p>
               <p>"Our neighbors have been very attentive," remarked Miss Mowbray, scarcely able to
                  repress a smile at the earnestness with which the odd-looking person regarded her;
                  "it is really kind in you all to remember that we are strangers and need some
                  neighborly acquaintances."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Miss Priscilla, with a shrug, "here's a new blacksmith come into
                  town just alter you did;—how many do you s'pose has called on his wife, who is
                  poor, and feeble too?"</p>
               <p>"I should think in a community like this," replied Miss Mowbray, "she would not
                  only receive many calls, but more substantial assistance."</p>
               <p>"That shows just how much you know of the world," said her visitor, not
                  unkindly;—"now this young lady here, I venture, could tell you a good many things
                  about the way poor folks are treated; though, being <emph>your</emph> companion,
                  she doesn't know the worst by a good deal."</p>
               <p>"I know enough about it," said the young lady with<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000091"/> a smile, "and I appreciate your honest, outspoken
                  words."</p>
               <p>"I allers did say jest what I thought, and I allers mean to," Miss Priscilla
                  replied; "now there's lots o' folks come here, that wouldn't a' spoke to you, if
                  you was as poor as Miss Denton, the blacksmith's wife."</p>
               <p>"I do not doubt it in the least," was Miss Mowbray's earnest reply; "I have seen
                  more of the world than you suspect, Miss Page, enough at least to make me sick of
                  its heartlessness."</p>
               <p>"I sed the very minnit I sot eyes on you, says I to Polly Bemis, 'there's a lady,
                  Polly, none o' your stuck-up ones nuther; but a real bonny fidy one, jest like
                  Miss Thornton.'"</p>
               <p>"I certainly should be very proud of the comparison, if I deserved it," said Miss
                  Mowbray, laughing; "for Mrs. Thornton is my ideal of a lady—dignified without
                  pride, refined without affectation, and generous, almost to a fault, without
                  ostentation."</p>
               <p>"She's all that and ever so much more," cried Miss Priscilla enthusiastically; "I
                  don't believe, if an angel from heaven could come down here and live, they'd be
                  any better. Why, she's made the lame walk, the sick well, and poor desponding
                  critters that hadn't got nothin' to live for, she's sot right up in the world, and
                  made 'em feel as good as any body."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Thornton would feel highly flattered by your remarks if she should hear
                  them," Mrs. Blair observed with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>"No she wouldn't nuther, ma'am; she'd say jest what she has a hundred times before
                  to me; 'Miss Page,' sed she to me, 'such praise belongs not to a poor, imperfect
                  being like me; I much fear that the final account which I must render of my
                  stewardship, will be found full of mistakes and errors'—so you see, ma'am, she
                  don't look upon her wealth as her own—only given her to do good with."</p>
               <p>"Admirable woman! would that the world were full of such!" exclaimed Miss
                  Mowbray's friend.</p>
               <p>Miss Priscilla turned to the speaker with a peculiar smile. "If the world was full
                  of 'em," said she, "you and I wouldn't be dependent no longer, would we?"</p>
               <p>"The dependence I feel is by no means disagreeable to me," replied the young lady,
                  looking at her companion.</p>
               <p>"That's all very well for one to say who can't help themselves; but wouldn't you
                  like now to change places with Miss Mowbray here, if you could?"</p>
               <p>The burst of merriment which followed her question, in which even staid Mrs. Blair
                  seemed almost inclined to join, quite disconcerted Miss Priscilla.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I meant no offence," said she, apologetically.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, certainly not," said the young lady, whose brown eyes still sparkled with
                  fun; "but just think how <emph>I</emph> should look setting up to be a rich
                  lady."</p>
               <p>"I've seen many a one who deserved it less," said Miss Priscilla, whose heart was
                  fairly won by the rich, musical laugh which followed Miss Singleton's remark.</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7276-00000092"/>
               <p>"And none who deserved it more," added Miss Mowbray, throwing her arm around her
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"Did you hear our minister's sermon last Sunday about being contented with such
                  things as we have?" asked Miss Priscilla.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did, and liked it very much," Miss Mowbray replied.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, it's mighty fine doctrine for the rich; but I can tell you, Miss Mowbray,
                  there's many a poor family here that has to be contented with one meal a day, and
                  drefful poor at that."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" exclaimed Miss Mowbray; "why I thought this was a very thriving
                  place. It is not long since I saw a notice in many of the papers of the uncommon
                  benevolence of the people here."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, wonderful benevolence, jest 'cause they give a hundred dollars to make
                  Mister Flint a director in some outlandish society, and let the poor critters all
                  'round 'em starve," retorted the spinster with feeling.</p>
               <p>"Surely that could not be called 'benevolence,'" said Mrs. Blair. "I think that
                     <emph>true</emph> charity always begins at home."</p>
               <p>"So do I, ma'am," said Miss Priscilla, respectfully, "and that makes me think of
                  my errand; we've been tryin' to get up a Sunday-school class among the poor
                  children, and not one on 'em, as I've found, has got a decent suit o' clothes to
                  wear,—so I thought mabbe I could go round and get enough to fix 'em up so they'd
                  do."</p>
               <p>"Your object is very praiseworthy," said Miss Mowbray bray, drawing forth her
                  purse, "I thank you for calling on me—here are ten dollars for you, and whenever
                  you know of any one in want, come to me."</p>
               <p>"Here are ten more," added Miss Singleton, slipping a bill in her hands; "some day
                  I should like to go with you, and see these poor people of whom you speak."</p>
               <p>It aint for me to thank you," said Miss Priscilla, in a grateful tone, "there's
                  better hearts 'n mine 'll do that."</p>
               <p>In a few minutes her steeple-crowned bonnet was seen bobbing off in the direction
                  of the Parsonage.</p>
               <p>"There, there, Mister Flint!" cried she, entering that worthy's study, with her
                  hand held out triumphantly towards him, "didn't I tell you you hadn't squeezed us
                  all dry when you sent off that hundred dollars, eh?"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Miss Priscilla?" he asked, in no very good humor.</p>
               <p>"You know what I mean; when I axed you about fixing them poor children for the
                  Sunday school, you said we had done so much lately, the thing couldn't be
                  accomplished at present, that's what you said, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes,—I knew it would take a good deal to do what you proposed, and it's very
                  hard times with us now, and—"</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said she, interrupting him, "hard times or no hard times, here's
                  more'n ever we'll want to get every one on 'em some good clothes."</p>

               <p>"Eh? you don't say so!" said the minister, opening his eyes wide, as she displayed
                  a handful of bills before his greedy sight; "where <emph>did</emph> all this come
                  from?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I guess there's <emph>some</emph> folks here, if they <emph>be</emph> rich,
                  aint afraid o' helping poor folks <emph>too</emph> much," Miss Priscilla said,
                  with an emphasis which he well understood.</p>
               <p>"Have you been to Woodbine Lodge?" he asked, pretending not to notice her
                  meaning.</p>
               <p>"Well, I shouldn't be surprised if I had," said she, with a knowing look.</p>
               <p>"Did they say any thing about me there?"</p>
               <p>"You? la, no sir; what should they have to say about you, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," said he, ashamed of the feeling he had betrayed; "but what did they
                  give you there?"</p>
               <p>"Twenty-five dollars, sir; Miss Mowbray gave me ten, and the young lady that's
                  with her, ten, and the old lady, five—wasn't that handsome, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Very; but you say the young lady gave ten! why she's nothing herself but a
                  charity-seeker—it's wrong, absolutely wrong, for her to give away Miss Mowbray's
                  money so."</p>
               <p>"Charity-seeker, or not," exclaimed Miss Priscilla, waxing warm in her
                  indignation, "she's got a heart, sir, and that's what some of us can't boast, sir;
                  Miss Mowbray loves her like a sister, I could see that."</p>
               <p>"Ah? that alters the case, then," and Mr. Flint jotted down in his memory that he
                  must be a little more attentive to the young lady next time he called.</p>
               <p>"I don't think it alters the case one mite," said the still vexed little woman;
                  "she's jest as good, and she aint no better 'n if she hadn't a sixpence. For my
                  part," she continued, rolling up the bills, and putting them in her pocket, "I'm
                  sick and tired of all this bowing and sarving money, money, money. Have you been
                  to see Miss Denton yet, sir?"</p>
               <p>"No, really; I am so busy I haven't time to make calls."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" Miss Priscilla began, while her small black eyes flashed, but at that
                  moment she felt a soft touch on the arm.</p>
               <p>"I've got a nice cup of tea for you in the other room," said the minister's
                  dutiful wife, and the visitor's caustic tongue was arrested in its course.</p>

               <p>THROUGH the busy throng, which crossed and recrossed each other at every angle,
                  Richard Morton walked with silent, thoughtful steps. "Twenty-one to-day," said he,
                  thinking aloud in his abstraction, "and what am I? a mere hanger-on in my father's
                  house—with no settled plan, or purpose in life before me. I have education,
                  talents, and capacity, for being something more than a rich man's son, and I
                     <emph>will</emph> be something more. Had I no other incentive to effort, the
                  promise of Maggie's hand would drive me to move heaven and earth to gain the
                  prize. But one more trial, and that, on this very day when I attain my majority,
                  will I make to win my father's consent to our marriage, and then, if he refuse, I
                  will adopt my sweet counsellor's advice, and work out for myself, by honest toil,
                  an honorable name and destiny. I should glory in it; and but for the delay it
                  would cause in making her mine, should choose it rather as my portion, than the
                  fortune which my father will bestow upon me."</p>
               <p>Thus he mused till he reached the office, where, to his surprise, he found his
                  father busily engaged at his desk, with a confusion of papers around him.</p>
               <p>"Really, sir," said Richard, approaching him with a smile, "your example is quite
                  a reproach to my tardiness—what brought you out so early this morning?"</p>
               <p>Judge Morton looked up, and for a moment the world <emph>seemed</emph> banished
                  from that face. "You are twenty-one to-day, my son," said he, holding out his hand
                  affectionately; "permit me to congratulate you on the freedom of thought and
                  action which henceforth belong to you."</p>
               <p>Richard warmly grasped the extended hand. "I thank you, sir," said he, with deep
                  feeling; "a father's kind wishes I consider a most auspicious omen for the
                  future."</p>
               <p>"And you have thought sometimes, that I have felt unkindly towards you, Richard,
                  have you not?"</p>
               <p>"You can best judge, sir, whether I had reason so to think," replied Richard,
                  respectfully, surprised at his father's unwonted humor.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, perhaps you had—I won't say you hadn't," the Judge quickly added,
                  "but to-day, my son, we must look at things a little differently. Read that paper,
                  and see if your father cares for you."</p>
               <p>Judge Morton watched with the deepest interest the varying emotions of Richard's
                  expressive face, as he perused the document placed in his hands. He had<pb
                     n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7276-00000095"/> determined to enforce his son's
                  obedience to his own wishes by a new mode of treatment, but as he gazed with
                  fatherly pride upon the noble bearing of one who was to perpetuate his name,
                  something within whispered, that as in the past, so for the future, the young man
                  would be governed only by the highest, purest motives. For a moment his selfish
                  heart did homage to his son's worth, but the next, as he saw Richard's eyes raised
                  from the paper with a grateful look, he was himself again.</p>
               <p>"This is indeed generous, father, but before I can accept it we must have a full
                  and perfect understanding with each other."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my son; that is very desirable—we have never been as familiar as I
                  could have wished."</p>
               <p>Richard bit his lip, for he well knew why. "I may as well be frank with you at
                  once," said he; "will you, with this fortune, give your consent to my marriage
                  with Miss Singleton."</p>
               <p>"Never!" replied his father, quickly; "neither will I give you the fortune if you
                  do marry her."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir," Richard calmly answered; "then I renounce the fortune, which in
                  truth I do not crave, except for her sake."</p>
               <p>"No doubt the fortune would be necessary to secure her," was the Judge's bitter
                  reply;—"penniless girls like her look pretty sharp after money."</p>
               <p>"You mistook my meaning entirely, sir," replied Richard, indignantly; "Miss
                  Singleton has no mercenary views, or she would not have rejected the independence
                  pendence Miss Mowbray sought to settle upon her, No, sir; my only desire for
                  wealth is, that <emph>I</emph> may place her in the position she deserves."</p>
               <p>"Richard, you are my only son, and I have a right to expect that you will not
                  disgrace my name by a dishonorable connection:" the Judge spoke sternly.</p>
               <p>"And I pledge you here, sir, that I will never disgrace you, or myself in that
                  way;" was Richard's earnest rejoinder; "Miss Singleton's hand would honor a
                  noble."</p>
               <p>"Are you irretrievably bent upon your mad scheme of marrying <emph>her,</emph>
                  Richard, when one beautiful, accomplished, with noble blood in her veins, and the
                  wealth of Crœsus at her command, waits but your asking, to give you her hand?"
                  asked the Judge.</p>
               <p>"If, as I suppose, you allude to Miss Mowbray," replied Richard, "you were never
                  more mistaken in your life.—She waits no person's asking, for she will not marry
                  here; but much as I esteem her, were she ten times more beautiful, wealthy, and
                  accomplished, she could never fill the place in my heart that Miss Singleton
                  does."</p>
               <p>"All tomfoolery and nonsense!" exclaimed the Judge impatiently; "the girl has
                  bewitched you, boy—but let me tell you, not one cent of my hard-earned money shall
                  ever go to support her, the artful jade."</p>
               <p>"Father!" cried Richard, springing to his feet, excitedly, "you may cast insult
                  and opprobrium upon me, but <emph>her</emph> name shall be sacred. Unsay those
                  words, I entreat."</p>
               <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7276-00000096"/>
               <p>"So far from unsaying them, young man," said the Judge, his lips white with
                  passion, "I will add what your mother and sisters agree with me in believing—that
                  her intrigues are only equalled by her deceit."</p>
               <p>"Had any other than you, sir, uttered those words," said Richard, in a low tone,
                  "his tongue should have been silenced ere they could escape his lips. But now I
                  can only say, that when you are ready to do justice to outraged innocence, I will
                  receive your apology.—Till then you see me not;" and with these words the young
                  man left his father's presence.</p>
               <p>For some moments Judge Morton sat silently, leaning his head upon his hand.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I have been hasty," said he, at length, raising his head; "but the
                  foolish fellow provoked me so. He'll feel better by to-morrow morning, and then
                  we'll see if we can't compromise some way. It won't do to have a quarrel; for he's
                  a great favorite, and I should only get all the blame." Little did that father
                  know the spirit he had so grievously wounded—before the "morrow" dawned, Richard
                  had left behind him the home which should have cherished him as its glory and
                  pride.</p>
               <p>"I had foreseen this some time ago," said Melville Thornton in reply to a
                  communication to which he had been listening, and with which our readers are
                  already acquainted, "and yet I scarcely know what to say to you, my young
                  friend."</p>
               <p>"I have come to you and your excellent wife for counsel," Richard Morton replied;
                  "for I know you will deal frankly with me. Wherever I have erred, I would make
                  reparation at once; but, with your approbation of my course, I can go on, feeling
                  strong in the right."</p>
               <p>"You place me under great responsibility," said Mr. Thornton; "but I would fain be
                  of service to you, if possible, in your painful situation. I do not think you have
                  erred—on the contrary, you have shown a nobleness of heart and purpose, that
                  places you higher in my estimation than ever. What says my wife?" he added,
                  turning to her with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Oh, woman's sympathies are always with the heart," Mrs. Thornton replied archly;
                  "but did I not know that Mr. Morton has chosen wisely in this respect, I might
                  read him a homily on filial obedience. Allow me to say, Mr. Morton," she added,
                  while a tear trembled in her eye, "that you have proved yourself worthy of one
                  who, I had thought, could scarce be mated. God prosper you in the future till you
                  shall receive your reward!"</p>
               <p>Completely overcome with their generous sympathy, Richard Morton bowed his head in
                  his hands and wept—yes, the strong man wept in the fulness of his gratitude for
                  these first flowers strewn in the path he had chosen.</p>
               <p>"Your kindness has quite unmanned me," he said at length, controlling his emotion.
                  "I can steel my heart against unkindness and reproach; but for such warm, earnest
                  sympathy, I was scarcely prepared."</p>
               <p>"Let me bestow it in a more substantial way than words," said Mr. Thornton,
                  slipping a purse in his hand;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7276-00000097"/> "the
                  suddenness with which you left your home, may render this useful to you."</p>
               <p>"Your generosity is none the less noble," replied Richard, returning it, "that I
                  do not need your gift. I am not such a spendthrift as my father's liberal
                  allowance would imply. I have sufficient for the present; and for the future," he
                  added with a smile, "my own exertions must provide."</p>
               <p>"You will find your path beset with trials and temptations," said Mr. Thornton;
                  "but I have confidence in the firmness of your purpose and the ultimate success of
                  your hopes."</p>
               <p>"Such confidence does me honor," replied Richard, "and I can only hope that I may
                  prove worthy of it."</p>
               <p>"You have already!" cried Mrs. Thornton earnestly; "giving up home and fortune is
                  no slight test of principle, in my opinion."</p>
               <p>"I fear you give my principles too much credit there," Richard answered, blushing
                  deeply; "it would have been an infinitely greater sacrifice for me to have
                  remained at home and yielded to my father's wishes."</p>
               <p>"Well, you have, at least, shown yourself free from the money-loving spirit of the
                  world," Mrs. Thornton added.</p>
               <p>"So far from that," Richard smilingly replied, "my whole energies will now be
                  devoted to accumulating an independence."</p>
               <p>"Ah, but not for yourself, Richard!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to secure my own happiness I do it," said he. "Is not that sufficiently
                  selfish for this money-loving world?"</p>
               <p>You are really incorrigible, Richard," said Mrs. Thornton, laughing; "I must give
                  you over to Miss Singleton, to ascertain, if possible, the hidden motives of your
                  strange conduct."</p>
               <p>"And to that tribunal, with your permission, I will at once resort," he replied
                  gayly, rising to go.</p>
               <p>"Not till you promise to return here again soon."</p>
               <p>"I shall be most happy to do so," said he; "for I have need of much friendly
                  advice ere I launch my solitary barque upon the world's wide fluctuating
                  waters."</p>
               <p>"Here is an epitome of the advice my wife would give, I presume," Mr. Thornton
                  remarked, pointing to the small frame over the mantel.</p>
               <p>"A whole code of morals in one short sentence!" said Richard, as he read the
                  inscription, "a compendium of goodness to which I fear I shall never attain."</p>
               <p>"Nor can any attain it except by applying the principle to the most trivial as
                  well as the more important actions of life," Mr. Thornton replied.</p>
               <p>"In this lies the secret of Willow Glen's far-famed hospitality and benevolence, I
                  suspect," said Richard, as he left the house, accompanied by Mr. Thornton.</p>
               <p>"I did not know that Willow Glen was <emph>famous</emph> for its charities," the
                  latter replied, "but I do know that prosperity and happiness have filled our home
                  since my wife established there her golden rule. Were you my own son, Mr. Morton,
                  my earnest advice would be, that you take that motto as your rule of life—abide by
                  it, through whatever trials it may lead you, and my word for it, you will, even in
                  this life, find your reward, and in the life to come, joy eternal."</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7276-00000098"/>
               <p>"Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so to them,"
                  Richard slowly repeated. "I will endeavor, my dear sir, daily and hourly to lay
                  these words to heart, and in their application I shall feel strengthened by your
                  noble example."</p>
               <p>"Not mine," hastily replied Mr. Thornton, "but hers, whose near approach to
                  perfection makes my deficiencies more visible—my incomparable wife."</p>
               <p>"You speak like a lover," said Richard smilingly.</p>
               <p>"Aye! a thousand times more than a lover," Mr. Thornton added with deep feeling;
                  "her price is indeed far above rubies, and the heart of her <emph>husband</emph>
                  doth safely trust in her."</p>

               <p>FROM the fearful accusations of his newly awakened conscience Albert Atherton
                  vainly endeavored to flee. Ever before his vision rose with terrible distinctness,
                  the face and form of his once beautiful and beloved Agnes. He saw her as when
                  first her artless beauty and purity moved even his callous heart with admiration,
                  and then on the wings of remorse his memory glided over the happy moments, when
                  the gentle, unsuspecting victim had been lured within the fascinations of his
                  serpent eye. He had loved her, it was true; but his was the love that would pluck
                  and not wear; that would gather all the fragrance of the rose and then cast it
                  forth as worthless. With the face of an angel and the tongue of the deceiver, he
                  had wooed and won a heart that could bear no affinity to his own. Pure, guileless
                  and trusting, Agnes had given her whole happiness into his keeping, and with one
                  fell stroke he had<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7276-00000099"/> crushed even her
                  existence. What remaineth to such but the lashings and goadings of a guilty
                  conscience, the ever flitting shadow of a grim and ghastly visage, whose hoarse
                  whisperings cannot be silenced, while its skeleton fingers ever and anon strive to
                  clutch its prey? Albert Atherton felt the stings of that conscience—he heard the
                  deep whisper of the demon shadow,—"Remorse," and with wild recklessness he sought
                  to silence the dread voices, in the haunts of dissipation and vice. But through
                  his midnight orgies still followed the phantom shadow, and louder than even the
                  gay, ribald song, sounded in his ears its note of warning.</p>
               <p>"What can a fellow do?" mused he one day, "here, for many months, I've run through
                  a regular course of what the old man would call '<emph>excesses</emph>'—I've
                  dipped into every thing that I could think of, and after all I can't get rid of
                  these devilish blues. I believe I'll go home, and see what my lady mother can say
                  for my comfort. She always hated Agnes, and is glad enough she's dead, I suppose.
                  Well, so should I be, if a fellow could only <emph>forget!</emph> What on earth
                  made me love her so! Pshaw! what do I care for that now!" he added, brushing an
                  unbidden tear from his eye, "I'll go home."</p>
               <p>And "home," with still the gaunt spectre hovering around him, he went. Shrinking
                  with instinctive guilt from the calm, mild gaze of his father, and the
                  affectionate welcome of his beautiful sister, Albert could feel at ease only in
                  the presence of her whose second self he was.</p>
               <p>To his mother he could confide without reserve even the darkest passions which had
                  swept over his soul, sure of finding there the sympathy he craved. Not a muscle of
                  her immovable face betrayed aught of feeling, as, in language which brought an
                  exultant smile to the shadow beside him, he portrayed the tragic fate of her he
                  had so heartlessly sacrificed, and his own agony, as for months he had vainly
                  striven with his mortal foe <emph>within.</emph> A scarce perceptible smile of
                  haughty scorn flitted over her features, as he spoke of sorrow for the past, and
                  consequent wretchedness apprehended for the future.</p>
               <p>Misguided mother! even now it is given thee to snatch thy first-born from the
                  horrible pit thine own false teachings have prepared for him. God help thee, when
                  at last his soul shall be required at thy hands!</p>
               <p>"Now I've made a clean breast of it," said Albert, as he concluded his dark tale,
                  "I hope you'll be able to drive off these blues. Such qualmish feelings make a
                  fellow almost desperate."</p>
               <p>"And very manly they are, certainly!" added his mother with a sneer. "I am
                  astonished, Albert, that that designing woman and her consumptive daughter could
                  have wheedled <emph>you</emph> into the belief that she was dying for you! No
                  doubt they were disappointed that they did not succeed in their manœuvres—thank
                  fortune, she is out of your way now! But you do not speak of Miss Mowbray; how
                  speeds your suit there?"</p>
               <p>"But poorly, I fear," Albert replied, "I have not<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000100"/> dared to see her since Agnes died—indeed I have not
                  been near any of them."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible you are so short-sighted!" exclaimed Mrs. Atherton, angrily; "why,
                  you have taken the very course to convince them of your guilt! You should have
                  faced the whole thing boldly, and not been frightened out of your wits by a parcel
                  of weak women. I am positively ashamed of you."</p>
               <p>"I have been deuced silly, that's a fact!" said Albert; his momentary gleam of
                  penitence vanishing at his mother's rebuke. "Blast me, if I get fooled so again!
                  But how shall I manage to get back into the heiress's good graces—it will take a
                  woman's quick wit to do that, I'm thinking."</p>
               <p>"It's a pity you hadn't wit enough to come to me long ago," she replied in a
                  bitter tone; "somebody doubtless has secured the prize while you have been nursing
                  your grief."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, mother, don't be hard upon me," said Albert, "I'm as glad as you are
                  now, that she's dead and out of my way, and I'm ready to obey you to the letter,
                  if you'll tell me what to do. Have the heiress now, I will, or die!" he added,
                  with, a fearful oath.</p>
               <p>"Where there's a will there's always a way," said his mother encouragingly. "I am
                  willing to overlook the past, if you will only make good your words and secure
                  her."</p>
               <p>"What shall I do first? he asked, "I do not even know where she is."</p>
               <p>"In one of your Aunt Charlotte's letters to your father, she mentioned that Miss
                  Mowbray had purchased a beautiful estate near them for a temporary residence—I
                  presume it must be the one we visited when I was there; she probably lives there
                  now, and as your aunt seems to have great influence with her, you must in some way
                  re-establish yourself at Willow Glen, and get their full confidence and aid."</p>
               <p>"I could do that best through Nettie," said Albert. "You know Aunt Lottie
                  perfectly idolizes her."</p>
               <p>"I am not quite prepared to trust Lennette there yet," replied the calculating
                  mother; "I fear she hasn't got over those foolish romantic notions about that low
                  fellow, Brown, who tried to entice her away with him I have kept her shut up ever
                  since, and she shall stay shut up till she marries Mr. Selwyn."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Selwyn!" cried Albert, "why, he's twice her age, mother!"</p>
               <p>"What of that? he's worth a mint of money, and his wife could hold up her head
                  with the highest in the land."</p>
               <p>"Net's a fool, if she don't have him then; that is, if she could get him," quoth
                  Albert.</p>
               <p>"Get him! why he's half distracted after her now. But the wretched girl insists
                  that she will not marry any one. It all comes of that pauper your uncle Joseph
                  took. We'll see though if her will can't be broken for once."</p>
               <p>"What does the old man say about it?"</p>
               <p>"Your father would do as he has always done; let<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000101"/> her please herself, and bring disgrace into our
                  house! That she shall never do while I live, never!" Mrs. Atherton exclaimed with
                  stern decision.</p>
               <p>"You are right there, mother,—all is, stick to it," said Albert. "But what am I to
                  do? Aunt Lottie and her sanctimonious spouse no doubt think me a great scapegrace,
                  and would give me the cold shoulder, I fear."</p>
               <p>"Go yourself, then, directly to Miss Mowbray,—invent the most plausible story you
                  can, to smooth over the past, and let what you see and hear govern your future
                  course; but remember, 'faint heart never won fair lady.'"</p>
               <p>"I'll turn saint," exclaimed Albert suddenly. "I believe that's the surest way to
                  gain a lady's favor; and besides, I always thought Miss Mowbray had a liking for
                  pious folks."</p>
               <p>"Turn what you please," replied his mother, "if you only gain your object."</p>
               <p>Retreating, and still retreating, its skeleton finger pointing menacingly to the
                  victim thus snatched from its grasp, the shadow vanished from his side, and Albert
                  was left to his own evil counsel.</p>
               <p>"Now for mock heroics and pious cant," said he, as, a few days after the interview
                  with his mother, he was ushered into the splendid drawing-room at Woodbine Lodge;
                  "it's a pretty desperate game, but I'll e'en do my best to win; gold fish must be
                  caught with cunning bait."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Atherton! is it possible!" was Miss Mowbray's bray's rather cool salutation
                  to her visitor, as she entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you did not expect to see me again," said he, with well-assumed
                  dejection, "after the painful circumstances attending our last interview; but,
                  Miss Mowbray, yours is not the heart to withhold sympathy from misery like mine. I
                  have suffered,—I am still suffering most intensely."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you say that," she replied with more cordiality in her tone;
                  "not that I would rejoice in another's unhappiness, but it shows that—"</p>
               <p>"That I am not the heartless being you thought," he quickly added, as she
                  hesitated.</p>
               <p>She nodded assent, and he continued:—</p>
               <p>"No, I am not heartless; whatever my faults, that certainly is not one of them. I
                  have grieved more deeply over poor Agnes' unhappy and fatal delusion than you can
                  imagine, and had I sooner known that she cherished it, I would have died to save
                  her."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Atherton," said Miss Mowbray, with deep feeling, "this is a subject upon
                  which I cannot converse with you. The grave has covered all the wrongs my poor
                  cousin suffered, and I would not recall them."</p>
               <p>"Your cousin!" he repeated with surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes; have you not heard of the discovery we made after Agnes was buried? She was
                  my cousin, and Aunt Blair is now a beloved inmate of my home."</p>
               <p>Here was a dilemma! recovering quickly, however, from the dismay this news caused
                  him, he said in his most insinuating manner,—</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7276-00000102"/>
               <p>"I am really rejoiced to hear this, both because of the happiness it must give you
                  to find such a worthy relative, and the great comfort to Mrs. Blair in having
                  restored to her almost a daughter."</p>
               <p>"Agnes' place can never be supplied in her mother's heart," said Miss Mowbray;
                  "she was very dear to her."</p>
               <p>"Agnes was an angel!" exclaimed Albert, and for once his heart responded to his
                  words. "Some time," he added, "I must see Mrs. Blair; I have much to say to her,
                  but not now."</p>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray," said he, looking at her earnestly, "can you so far forget the
                  past, that I may hope once more to win a place in your confidence and esteem?"</p>
               <p>This was a bold question for him, and Miss Mowbray did not attempt to conceal her
                  astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Mind," said he, "I do not ask your confidence at once; all I ask is, that you
                  will give me an opportunity of proving myself worthy of it. I have not lived these
                  months past, in silence and sorrow, to no purpose. A change has come over me. Let
                  me but feel that I can be restored to the companionship of one so good and pure,
                  and you may make my probation as long as you please. Only say that you do not
                  despise me,"—and with well dissembled emotion, he wiped a tear from his eye.</p>
               <p>What reply Miss Mowbray would have made to this earnest appeal, apparently so
                  sincere and humble, Albert had no means of judging; for at that instant the
                  servant announced two gentlemen, and Mr. Thornton and Richard Morton entered the
                  room.</p>
               <p>Astonishment, not unmingled with contempt, was in the cold greetings they bestowed
                  upon him; but with an assurance which brought a burning blush to Miss Mowbray's
                  cheek, Albert received them with great cordiality, remarking that "the joy of
                  seeing again such friends almost compensated for the loss of his delightful
                  tte--tte with the fair hostess."</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornton glanced uneasily at Miss Mowbray, as he said this, but her look of
                  mortification and anger reassured him, and he merely replied:—</p>
               <p>"We should be very sorry to interrupt a tte--tte which was <emph>mutually</emph>
                  agreeable. Perhaps Miss Mowbray will tell us where we may find Miss
                  Singleton?"</p>
               <p>"Pray be seated, gentlemen; I assure you you are very welcome," she replied,
                  heartily vexed at the false position in which she was placed.</p>
               <p>Richard Morton spoke a few words to her in a low tone, and then left the
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>"He is a noble fellow," said Mr. Thornton as the door closed.</p>
               <p>"I have rarely seen his equal," Miss Mowbray replied with warmth. "By the way,
                  what has become of that Mr. Brown, who was at your house when we visited you last
                  summer?"</p>
               <p>"I have heard nothing of him for a long time," said Mr. Thornton. "Brother Joseph
                  wrote us many months since, that the young man had gone to find some clue, if
                  possible, to his parentage."</p>
               <p>"I imagine that will be a difficult task," Albert remarked, with a sneer.</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7276-00000103"/>
               <p>"Why so?" asked Miss Mowbray, turning her black eyes full upon him.</p>
               <p>"Because," he replied, nothing daunted, "what other people failed to discover
                  years ago, is not likely to come to light at this late day. It's very well for him
                  to make a feint of it though."</p>
               <p>"I thought him a young man of great refinement of mind, as well as elegance of
                  person," said Miss Mowbray, without noticing the ill-natured remark; "perhaps I
                  was more interested in him on your sister's account, Mr. Atherton," she added with
                  a meaning smile.</p>
               <p>"I do not see what connection my sister could have with your interest in him,"
                  said Albert.</p>
               <p>"They were so much attached to each other," she replied, "and we all loved Nettie
                  so dearly that it was impossible to exclude him from our affections, too."</p>
               <p>"You were quite mistaken with regard to Nettie's feelings," said Albert; "she is
                  soon to be married."</p>
               <p>"Married! is it possible! to whom?" were the almost simultaneous exclamations of
                  Mr. Thornton and Miss Mowbray.</p>
               <p>"A Mr. Selwyn, of New York, an immensely rich and aristocratic gentleman," was
                  Albert's reply.</p>
               <p>In a moment the whole thing flashed before her; Nettie was to be sacrificed on the
                  shrine of mammon! She could not forget the sweet, blushing confidence the dear
                  girl had reposed in her, and she <emph>knew</emph> Nettie's heart belonged not to
                  the "rich and aristocratic" suitor.</p>
               <p>"When do you say the marriage will take place?" she inquired.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps in two, or three months; I do not know precisely when."</p>
               <p>"Then, Mr. Atherton," cried she eagerly, "I have a favor to ask of you, which is,
                  that you will escort Nettie hither at your earliest convenience. I must have a
                  visit from her before that event."</p>
               <p>"Aha, my lady!" was his exulting thought; "now I've got a nice hold upon you;"—but
                  his words and manner were calm and courteous, as he rose to leave. "My pleasure,"
                  said he, "is so intimately connected with the furtherance of your wishes on this
                  subject, that I shall hasten to obey them at once. Nettie will be but too happy to
                  accept your kind invitation, and I, as a subordinate, thank you for the honor
                  conferred on me. You will see us soon."</p>
               <p>"One must endure him, for sweet Nettie's sake," Miss Mowbray remarked to Mr.
                  Thornton, when they were alone.</p>
               <p>"How strangely unlike they are," said he; "but I am really troubled about her
                  rumored marriage. I am confident she loves young Brown, and I am equally confident
                  that he is worthy of her. This must be some of her mother's work."</p>
               <p>"I have a plan to save Nettie, if such is the case. I love her too well to see her
                  sacrificed," Miss Mowbray replied, just as her friend, with beaming eyes and
                  glowing cheek, came in.</p>
               <p>"Ah! what a fine thing morning air is, to paint one's cheeks so fresh and rosy,"
                  she exclaimed, roguishly pointing to the blushing girl.</p>

               <p>"It is something better than morning air," said Richard Morton, coming forward
                  with a face as joyous as her own; "it is the reflection of her pure and loving
                  heart, that warms my Maggie's cheek. Now that we are all friends here, I must tell
                  you," turning to Mr. Thornton, "that she bids me God speed in my course, with the
                  hope of a bright reward to cheer me in my toils."</p>
               <p>"You speak in riddles, Mr. Morton," said Miss Mowbray, gazing from one to the
                  other; "to what toils do you refer."</p>
               <p>"None that are to be dreaded now," he replied, with a glance of proud affection at
                  Miss Singleton; "she will best explain to you, while I return with Mr. Thornton,
                  as I promised his excellent wife. You will see me again soon, though, for I must
                  away to the labor that shall bring me such happiness;" and kissing his fair lady's
                  hand, he departed, with the bright smile of hope on his manly face.</p>
               <p>"What does this all mean, dear Lucille?"</p>
               <p>"Isn't he noble—generous, <emph>unselfish,</emph> Maggie! Ah, his reward shall
                  come sooner than he dreams!"</p>

               <p>TWILIGHT at Willow Glen—and in the deep recess of a window which overlooked his
                  beautiful domain, the lover husband sat, clasping a small white hand within his
                  own. This had been an hour of retrospection—one of those seasons which come to
                  all, when each moment of the past seems painted in living colors, as the panoramic
                  vision floats swiftly by. They had lived over again the happy days and years of
                  their wedded life, and, encouraged by her willing listener, Charlotte Thornton had
                  dwelt on the scenes of her early life, when blessed with the watchful care and
                  tenderness of loving parents. In accents low and sad she told how death had
                  severed the happy household band, and left her with only the sweet remembrance of
                  a mother's holy life, of which her "golden legacy" was a fitting and beautiful
                  exemplification. Long she lingered over this dear theme, her soft voice scarce
                  breaking the silence<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7276-00000105"/> lence around them,
                  while he who drank in her words, felt his soul stirred with the memories of his
                  own early years.</p>
               <p>The quiet calm of the hour, the deepening shadows evening fast threw about them,
                  favored his thoughts. Pressing her hand as his wife's voice ceased, he said,
                  tenderly: "Your life, dearest Lottie, with all its dark spots, has been as
                  unruffled as is ever your own sweet spirit. But with me it has been far
                  otherwise." Here he stopped.</p>
               <p>In the dim twilight he could not see the eager face Charlotte Thornton raised to
                  his, as she tremblingly awaited the long wished-for revelation.</p>
               <p>"My days have glided so happily along since you became my loved wife," he added,
                  with a voice as gentle almost as her own, "that the events of my early years
                  seemed like some far-off dream. To-night, however, they come to me with a
                  distinctness that impresses their reality."</p>
               <p>"I have so longed, yet so feared to ask you of them—of her to whom your youthful
                  love was given."</p>
               <p>"It was a boyish passion—totally unlike that which drew me to your side, Lottie,"
                  he replied, half apologetically, "yet you shall hear all, and then judge for
                  yourself. I should long ago have told you the sad history of my early marriage,
                  had you expressed the desire you have now, but there were so many painful
                  circumstances connected with it. I have avoided all allusion to it even in
                  thought."</p>
               <p>"I would not have you recall any thing painful, merely to indulge my curiosity,"
                  his wife quickly rejoined; "pray dismiss it at once, you have already told me all
                  that it is needful for me to know."</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay," said he, with a smile, his own peculiar smile, as he drew here within
                  his arms, "I shall begin to think my model wife a very little jealous. No, Lottie
                  dear, it was given you to awaken the <emph>first</emph> deep, immeasurable love of
                  my heart. But poor Alice was like a beautiful flower, that I, in my youthful
                  fancy, sought to wear in my bosom.—Alas! the flower faded ere its fragrance
                  reached my soul! I was but a college lad—she a Miss at school, when first we met.
                  Her extreme beauty made her an object of great attraction to the students, and I
                  joined the strife for her special favor. My vanity was soon flattered by her
                  preference—upon no other did her eye flash so brightly, her smile beam so
                  sweetly;—then, as the tell-tale blush at my approach betrayed the secret to
                  others, in the pride of my conquest, I thought myself desperately in love. Gay,
                  thoughtless, full of romance, it required but little persuasion to gain her
                  consent to a secret marriage, for she had told me of her humble birth and poverty,
                  and I knew too well my father's prejudices to expect his sanction. Alice confided
                  the secret of our union to a mutual friend, at whose house we found a happy home,
                  till I completed my college course and graduated with its highest honors. Meantime
                  scandal had been busy with our names, and Alice drooped under its poisonous
                  exhalations. Then came the first bitter realization of the misery my blind folly
                  had brought upon the young<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7276-00000106"/> and
                  beautiful girl. There was but one honorable course for me to pursue, and I
                  hastened at once to my father, resolved to brave his displeasure by announcing to
                  him and the world my marriage.</p>
               <p>I left Alice with a happy, confident smile on her face, and a joy in her heart, to
                  which it had been a stranger for many months. Never shall I forget how exquisitely
                  lovely she looked, as from her window she watched my departure, waving her hand
                  till I was lost to her sight. Little thought we then that our first parting would
                  be our last. I never saw her again."</p>
               <p>Melville Thornton ceased, and a warm, expressive pressure of the hand, told him
                  with what deep sympathy his wife listened.</p>
               <p>"I came home," he resumed, "and found my father prostrated by a paralytic
                  stroke—scarcely able to converse,—his life depending, seemingly, upon the absence
                  of all excitement. Distracted with contending emotions, I watched over him daily
                  and hourly, hoping some safe moment might occur, for the accomplishment of my
                  wishes.</p>
               <p>"Thus two months passed, when my father's improved state emboldened me to speak of
                  the subject nearest my heart. Surprising joy! he not only forgave me, but invited
                  me to bring his new daughter home at once, that he might see her before he died!
                  Sickness, and the near approach of death, had greatly changed him. I eagerly
                  prepared to obey this welcome request, and the carriage was at the door in which I
                  was to go, and return with my wife, when again his mortal foe returned, and laid
                  my father senseless before me. Leaving him in that state was not to be thought of
                  for a moment; so I dispatched a hurried note to Alice, telling her what had
                  occurred, and begging her to return immediately with the messenger to the home
                  henceforth her own. The next day he brought—not Alice, but a letter from the lady
                  where we had lived, saying, that Alice left there a few weeks before, in an
                  unhappy state of mind, to return, as she said, to her parents—that she had heard
                  nothing from her since, but advised me to lose no time in seeking her.</p>
               <p>"My father still lay in an unconscious state, liable, as the physician said, to
                  terminate fatally at any moment. I therefore again sent forth our trusty servant
                  to the place where her parents resided, a long, weary journey from here, and again
                  he returned, after more than a week's absence, unsuccessful. 'There was no such
                  family living there now,' was all the information he could elicit; and between
                  intense anxiety for my wife, and distress for my father, who was rapidly failing,
                  I passed several wretched days. At last the summons came, and breathing a dying
                  blessing upon his only child, my father passed from earth. Over the grave of the
                  dead I shed a few bitter tears, ere I hastened forth to seek Alice. I found her
                  father's humble abode, but its doors were closed, and its inmates gone,—gone, none
                  could tell where. Alas! the sad tale was soon told. My frequent letters to Alice
                  had been intercepted, and the poor girl, stung to madness by my apparent
                  desertion, and the vile tongue of slander, to which even<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000107"/> her friends began to listen, fled to her father's
                  roof for protection. The large remittances, enclosed in my letters, had of course
                  never reached her, and destitution was added to her other miseries. Late one
                  evening she reached the home of her childhood;—with one mighty effort she threw
                  open the door, and sank in deathlike exhaustion at the feet of her horror-stricken
                  parents. Through all that long night, sounds of mourning and distress were heard
                  in the lowly dwelling, and the morning sun shone upon a fearful scene. Alice's
                  troubles were all stilled in the cold sleep which knows no waking; while the
                  frosts of age had, in those few hours, fallen on the heads of the smitten parents.
                  Like a tiny bud unfolding in an icy clime, a new-born babe lay in the almost
                  unconscious grasp of its grandmother. With what different anticipations had Alice
                  looked forward to this event!</p>
               <p>"Bowed with grief and shame, for no moment of reason had been granted to Alice for
                  explanation, the broken-hearted parents left the scene of their humiliation. They
                  could not remain where every thing reminded them so vividly of their lost idol,
                  and so they became strangers and pilgrims on earth."</p>
               <p>"What became of the child?" asked Charlotte Thornton, as her husband paused.</p>
               <p>"He soon sank to an early grave, and was buried with his grandmother; but where, I
                  could never ascertain."</p>
               <p>"And her father?"</p>
               <p>"Became a harmless maniac, wandering where he chose. I have told you a long, sad
                  story, Lottie," Melville Thornton added, kissing the forehead which rested on his
                  breast; "can you wonder that I carried a heavy, troubled heart, abroad with
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"My only wonder is that you were supported under such terrible afflictions," she
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"You must remember, Lottie, that I was but a youth then, with no such maturity of
                  feeling as I have now."</p>
               <p>"True, but you had less to comfort you."</p>
               <p>"There you are right, wife. I had not then learned the infinite source of strength
                  and hope. That was reserved for my lonely wanderings, when earth seemed full of
                  happiness for all but me. Out of my desolation I cried, and straightway my soul
                  was filled with peace and joy. Yet there were moments, nay, hours, when again
                  darkness and despair would hold dominion over me. It was not till the Lord
                  vouchsafed to me his last, best gift to man, a blessed wife, that the shadow was
                  for ever lifted from my heart. You, Lottie, was the precious, chosen vessel of
                  mercy to me."</p>
               <p>"Pray God I may ever be such," was her earnest rejoinder.</p>
               <p>"And now, dearest," he continued, "let the gloomy past lie buried where for more
                  than twenty years it has lain. It was always my intention to confide to you the
                  sad tale I have now done, but all future allusions to it will be painful."</p>
               <p>"It shall be as you wish," she replied; "yet tell me,<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000108"/> did you ever know who it was that intercepted your
                  letters and money?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I did not rest till I had ferreted out the whole matter—it was one of the
                  students who had persecuted Alice with his attentions, and even had the audacity
                  to renew them in my absence."</p>
               <p>"What was done with the villain? surely no punishment could be too great for him!"
                  exclaimed Charlotte Thornton, shuddering.</p>
               <p>"He had been so adroit, that nothing could be proved against him," her husband
                  replied. "His fearful account yet stands for a terrible reckoning before the great
                  Judge of all."</p>
               <p>"Have you ever seen him since?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he has even had the boldness to come here, and beg for my co-operation in
                  forcing his son to marry an heiress."</p>
               <p>"You surely cannot mean Judge Morton!" cried Mrs. Thornton, springing up
                  excitedly.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, Lottie dear; your own pure instinct did not err, when you shrunk with
                  such repugnance from that man. It was he."</p>
               <p>"Yet you did not turn him from your door! how could you treat him otherwise?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornton silently pointed towards the mantel. "Your creed, Lottie," said he,
                  with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>"I confess I do not see the application in this case," she replied.</p>
               <p>"As I hope for leniency and mercy from Him against whom I have sinned all my
                  life," said Mr. Thornton, with deep emotion, "so must I extend the same to my
                  brother, how much soever he may have wronged me."</p>
               <p>"Right, as you always are!" his wife exclaimed, "yet such perfection is not easily
                  attained."</p>
               <p>"Not till all are made perfect in Christ," was his reply.</p>

               <p>"QUITE a pretty little affair, truly," exclaimed Mr. Ashton, one of the most
                  talented and influential lawyers in the city of New York, as he refolded a letter
                  he had just been reading; "my friend Thornton hasn't lost all his romance yet, if
                  he is a married man," he continued, with a shrug: "I declare he has quite stirred
                  up my sluggish, bachelor blood with this love affair. But he must have more faith
                  in the potent charm than I, if he believes it will last long. Probably young
                  Morton does not know the value of the property he has sacrificed for this poor
                  girl. As to <emph>love,</emph> I have yet to learn that it is any thing but a
                  foolish delusion. But for this young man, I will do all Thornton wishes—nay more—I
                  will study his character, and if I find truth and sincerity there, he shall not
                  long wait for fortune's smile." Here his meditations were suddenly broken off by
                  the entrance of a young man, who, he at once rightly conjectured, was the very one
                  in question.</p>
               <p>"Have I the honor of addressing Mr. Ashton?" he asked in a rich, clear voice.</p>
               <p>"Whatever honor there may be in that is certainly yours; my name is Ashton," the
                  lawyer replied with a pleasant smile; "will you be seated, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I am a stranger here, having arrived only this morning, and I bring a letter of
                  introduction to you from an old friend of yours, I believe," said the other,
                  handing him an unsealed note.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Thornton. Yes, he was a college friend of mine, though a few years my senior.
                  Well, Mr. Morton, what can I do for you?"</p>
               <p>Richard Morton looked up with a half serious, half comical face; "Perhaps you can
                  tell better than I, sir," said he; "I have come here without money, reputation, or
                  friends, all of which I am determined to gain."</p>
               <p>"That is right! set your mark high, my young friend," said the lawyer approvingly;
                  "but with what weapons will you besiege the triple fortress?"</p>
               <p>"Helmet, sword, and shield, shall bear but one device—<emph>truth,</emph>" Richard
                  replied, in the same strain.</p>
               <p>"Good! but through what medium will you wield the mighty power?"</p>
               <p>"The same that has already been ennobled by your example, sir,—the law."</p>
               <p>"Ah! then you belong to our profession," Mr. Ashton exclaimed, pleased with the
                  delicate compliment: "Have you been in practice?"</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7276-00000110"/>
               <p>"I have not; but my preparation should be sufficiently thorough to justify my
                  entering it at once; I have read very extensively."</p>
               <p>"With whom?"</p>
               <p>"Judge Morton, of Boston."</p>
               <p>"A relative of yours, perhaps?"</p>
               <p>"He is my father, sir; but circumstances of a painful nature have separated
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, excuse me," quickly interposed the lawyer; "I have no business to be
                  so inquisitive."</p>
               <p>"It requires no apology, sir; it is proper that you should know something of one
                  who seeks your advice."</p>
               <p>A short silence ensued; Mr. Ashton was devising the best way to introduce a plan
                  he had already formed, and Richard Morton was still too anxious for the future to
                  heed the passing moments. There was the same indomitable spirit of energy and
                  perseverance in the two thus brought together. Lewis Ashton had, in early life,
                  been thrown upon the world in no very favorable position to win its smiles; but by
                  unremitting effort, he had gained a high place among those who would have scorned
                  his lowly youth. With an elegant exterior, a gifted mind, and abundant wealth, he
                  now stood upon the <emph>pinnacle</emph> of popularity in the most aristocratic
                  circles.</p>
               <p>But his keen eye had glanced beneath the polished surface, and his soul sickened
                  at the view. Little wonder, then, skeptic as he had become in all matters
                  pertaining to the heart, that he looked upon Richard Morton's sacrifice, as the
                  effect of a mere passing fancy. He did so regard it, notwithstanding Mr.
                  Thornton's warm eulogium upon the young man's constancy and devotion.</p>
               <p>There was something in Richard's face and manner that won his friendship at once,
                  and he inwardly resolved to watch over him as an elder brother.</p>
               <p>Upon this he was musing, during the momentary silence that followed Richard's
                  remark.</p>
               <p>"Do not think me unsocial," said he, resuming the conversation with a smile; "I
                  have been trying to devise the best way to serve you."</p>
               <p>"You are certainly very kind to bestow so much thought upon a stranger," Richard
                  replied; "I have no right to infringe thus upon your valuable time."</p>
               <p>"It is no infringement; it is a pleasure," said he; "and besides, like all the
                  rest of the world, I am selfish sometimes; and the plan I have to propose is
                  strongly impregnated with that cardinal virtue."</p>
               <p>"Ah! and what may it be, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Simply that you will relieve me of some of my labors, which are really becoming
                  onerous."</p>
               <p>"I would that I were capable of doing it," Richard replied with a gratified
                  smile.</p>
               <p>"Of that I must be the judge," said Mr. Ashton; "I have been looking for just such
                  a person for some time, and now that I have found one, I must hasten to secure
                  him. So, if agreeable to you, we will make our arrangements without delay, to
                  transfer a part of my burden to your shoulders. What do you say to that?"</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7276-00000111"/>
               <p>"I am so overwhelmed with surprise and joy that I can scarce find words to thank
                  you," Richard replied.</p>
               <p>"Meet me here, then, at three o'clock this afternoon;" quoth the lawyer; "and in
                  the mean time have your things removed to my apartments; here are the
                  directions."</p>
               <p>Thus Richard found himself launched at once into the full tide of business, under
                  the favorable auspices of his new friend. Little wot he whose gentle hand had thus
                  smoothed the way before him!</p>
               <p>"Morton," said Mr. Ashton one morning, soon after the former had been installed in
                  his office, "here are some important papers to be drawn up to-day; strange, that a
                  good sensible fellow like Selwyn should be caught at last in Cupid's snare."</p>
               <p>"Does it argue a want of goodness, or sense, to be thus caught?" Richard asked,
                  laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Not in your case, I'll grant at once, to save controversy," replied the other;
                  "but here's a man actually older than myself, so bewitched by the smiles of a
                  pretty girl, that he really believes himself in love! Faugh! what fools men make
                  of themselves sometimes!"</p>
               <p>"Because they chance to fall in love?" queried Richard.</p>
               <p>"I don't mean that exactly; that is, if there is any such thing as real, genuine
                  love, which I much doubt; but a man in Selwyn's position ought to know, that it
                  must be his millions, not himself, that would tempt a beautiful <emph>young</emph>
                  girl like Miss Atherton to marry him."</p>
               <p>"Miss Atherton! where is she from?" Richard exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"From Clifton, Massachusetts; her father is a country lawyer, and having lost most
                  of his property through a spendthrift son, they take this measure, I suppose, to
                  replenish their coffers."</p>
               <p>"You must be mistaken, Mr. Ashton; it cannot be Nettie Atherton!" said Richard
                  earnestly; "she would not marry one she did not love, if he were made of
                  gold."</p>
               <p>"There again comes up the mooted question; <emph>I</emph> do not believe people
                  marry for love. But you can refer to the papers to see whether it is really
                     <emph>the</emph> Nettie Atherton you know."</p>
               <p>"It must be the same," said Richard, looking over the document; "but I do not
                  believe this is done with her consent."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear fellow! you have something to learn yet. Do you think any young girl
                  in her senses would turn away from the dazzling prospect of becoming Mr. Selwyn's
                  wife—the leader of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ton?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"I think Nettie Atherton would," Richard simply answered.</p>
               <p>"She must be a paragon then," said Mr. Ashton; "but you see she has not refused;
                  here is her marriage settlement to be drawn up; and a most magnificent one it
                  is,—characteristic of Selwyn's generous nature."</p>
               <p>"Notwithstanding this, I am confident that Nettie will never marry Mr. Selwyn,
                  unless forced to do it. She loves, and is already engaged to another. If you knew
                  her, you would say the same, Mr. Ashton."</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7276-00000112"/>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha! what would Selwyn say to hear you talk! <emph>forced</emph> to marry
                  him, when the ladies are all crazy after him! But here he comes, and I must crack
                  this joke upon him—it is too good to be lost."</p>
               <p>"Nay, Mr. Ashton, I beg"—Richard began imploringly; but ere he could say more, the
                  subject of their conversation entered the office. With a smile whose genial warmth
                  reached Richard's heart, Mr. Selwyn entered at once upon his business with Mr.
                  Ashton.</p>
               <p>"I have called," said he, "to make a suggestion in reference to those papers I
                  left with you. Upon further reflection I have concluded to double the amount
                  mentioned there—it will secure more independence of feeling, you know."</p>
               <p>"Why, Selwyn!" exclaimed Mr. Ashton, slapping him familiarly on the shoulder; "has
                  the fellow gone clean mad? you'll make your wife <emph>too</emph> independent of
                  you."</p>
               <p>"So far as pecuniary matters are concerned, I would have her entirely so," Mr.
                  Selwyn replied, while something like a blush stole softly to his cheek.</p>
               <p>"Well, do you know I was just saying to my young friend here, that men will make
                  fools of themselves sometimes; and as your confidential friend and adviser, I must
                  say that I think you are very near making one of yourself now." Mr. Ashton said
                  this in a half-laughing, half-vexed sort of a way.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I am," said Mr. Selwyn, gayly; "but 'when ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly
                  to be wise,' you know."</p>
               <p>"Some pretend to say that you are wooing an unwilling bride, Selwyn; how is that?"
                  Mr. Ashton asked, jocosely.</p>
               <p>"Who said that!" cried Mr. Selwyn, springing up, while his face began to pale.</p>
               <p>"Why, man alive! what's the matter?" exclaimed the lawyer; "sit down; no one said
                  it in earnest. I was only repeating a joke we were enjoying when you came in."</p>
               <p>"Rather a serious joke for me though, if there should prove to be any truth in
                  it;" Mr. Selwyn remarked, more to himself than his hearers.</p>
               <p>"You do not mean to intimate that there <emph>may</emph> be any truth in it!" Mr.
                  Ashton exclaimed, with astonishment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selwyn made no reply, but glanced uneasily towards young Morton.</p>
               <p>"You can speak freely in his presence," said Mr. Ashton, replying to the look; "I
                  will answer for his discretion. And, besides, he is a friend of Miss Atherton.
                  Nay, Morton, stay;" he added, as the latter made a movement to leave; "Mr. Selwyn
                  will thank you for it."</p>
               <p>"I would not intrude upon private conversation of this nature," said Richard,
                  still endeavoring to go, but Mr. Selwyn made a motion for him to sit down, and he
                  therefore remained.</p>
               <p>"Did I understand Mr. Ashton that you are acquainted<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000113"/> quainted with Miss Atherton?" Mr. Selwyn asked,
                  with interest.</p>
               <p>"Personally, I do not know her as well as by reputation; yet I have met her
                  several times," Richard replied.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it was with you, then, that Mr. Ashton was enjoying the joke he mentioned
                  just now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; young Morton was giving me some of his sentimental ideas about love and
                  marriage," said Mr. Ashton, laughing, "and that led to the remark—but we meant no
                  offence to you, assuredly."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not; I do not so receive it," Mr. Selwyn replied, pleasantly; "but," he
                  added, in a low and trembling voice, "I should like Mr. Morton to tell me why he
                  made that remark."</p>
               <p>"I will do it, sir," said Richard, frankly; "I know that no mercenary
                  consideration could influence Nettie Atherton to marry one she does not love,
                  and"—he hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Go on—go on;" cried Mr. Selwyn, "do not fear to say what you think."</p>
               <p>"Well then, sir, I must say that I believe her heart belongs to another than
                  yourself—one whom she has loved from childhood, and if she marries other than him,
                  it will be against her will;" Richard stopped suddenly, as a frightful paleness
                  overspread Mr. Selwyn's face.</p>
               <p>"Young man!" he whispered, hoarsely, "do you <emph>know</emph> whereof you affirm?
                  Answer truly, as in the sight of God."</p>
               <p>"I would not answer you otherwise, though Heaven knows I grieve to wound you
                  thus—but better so, than that Nettie should be sacrificed; she will tell you, sir,
                  that what I have said, is true," Richard replied, sadly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selwyn's head had dropped upon his hands while Richard spoke, but as he
                  ceased, he sprang up, bursting forth with all the passionate vehemence of his
                  nature.</p>
               <p>"I do not believe one word of it; it's all a lie—a lie, sir—just because you want
                  her yourself. But she's mine—Nettie's <emph>mine!</emph> and no power on earth
                  shall take her from me."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashton was thunderstruck at this violent ebullition of feeling, but Richard
                  Morton calmly replied,—</p>
               <p>"Your words, Mr. Selwyn, convince me that you <emph>love</emph> Nettie Atherton;
                  therefore, I excuse your reference to myself. Believe me, sir, I pity you; from my
                  heart I grieve for you—but she whom you love is suffering even more intensely than
                  yourself. Have you no sympathy for her?"</p>
               <p>He had touched the right chord.</p>
               <p>"How know you that Nettie is suffering?" exclaimed Mr. Selwyn, recovering himself
                  somewhat; "and by what strange power do you move me thus? Forgive my hasty
                  words."</p>
               <p>"They were forgiven as soon as uttered," said Richard, grasping his extended hand;
                  "the power which stirs your spirit is not from me; honor and love<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000114"/> are struggling there, and I have not a doubt of the
                  issue of the noble strife."</p>
               <p>"Tell me more of this matter," said Mr. Selwyn, throwing himself, weak and
                  trembling, into a chair; "some things have seemed strange to me, but I did not
                  suspect what you have told me."</p>
               <p>Then Richard repeated to him all he knew of Nettie's early love for her uncle's
                  adopted son—of her mother's cruel persecution; and, finally, of the imprisonment
                  she had endured, to bring her to a forced consent to a marriage with him.</p>
               <p>Contending emotions raged within Mr. Selwyn's breast, as he listened to the
                  recital. The deep and bitter disappointment which had filled his heart at first,
                  gradually gave place to a yearning sympathy for the lovely, oppressed girl, and
                  when Richard concluded, he grasped his hand warmly, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"You have done your duty nobly, sir. God help me to do mine, also,"—and with these
                  words he left them.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! what a commotion about one girl! Selwyn is beside himself," exclaimed Mr.
                  Ashton, contemptuously, as the door closed.</p>
               <p>"He loves her, sir," Richard simply answered.</p>
               <p>"Love!" repeated he, in the same tone; "what is it, but a will-o'-the-wisp,
                  leading men blindly on to their own destruction; a dream, ending ever in a bitter
                  awakening; a shadow none but fools pursue!"</p>
               <p>"And yet," added Richard, smiling, "were I to wish you the highest earthly joy, it
                  would be that that dream might be yours, that shadow ever before <emph>you,</emph>
                  and that ignis fatuus lead you on to the blissful destruction of such false
                  views."</p>
               <p>"Heaven defend me!" cried Mr. Ashton, lifting his hands in pretended horror.</p>

                  such a fuss for? you know what you've got to do, and all this crying won't help

                  arms 'round him and said, 'save me, Oh, save me, Albert, and I will always love,

                  feller said? hi! dis nig like to tear his eyes out! 'make that rich girl marry me,

                  hisself couldn't tell dey was brudder and sister."</p>
               <p>"Was that what brought you here in such a passion just now, Becky?" Mrs. Blair
                  asked as soon as she had ceased laughing at her story, told with a ludicrous
                  mixture of pathos and indignation.</p>
               <p>"Yes, missus! dis nig can't stan' by and see de 'spectability of dis family
                  'suited," Becky proudly exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"That is right," said Mrs. Blair; "but the young ladies both love Nettie so well,
                  they pass over these things in her brother. She will have to go away when he does;
                  so we must get along as well as we can with<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000116"/> him, for the sake of keeping her a while longer.
                  But, Becky, be careful not to repeat any of these things to the servants."</p>
               <p>"Dis nig knows what she's 'bout," said Becky, who perfectly understood her
                  privileged position in the family.</p>
               <p>Such was the universal feeling at Woodbine Lodge towards Albert Atherton;—he must
                  be borne for Nettie's sake. Sweet Nettie! Miss Mowbray thought, as she gazed upon
                  her sad and drooping, yet almost ethereal loveliness, that she would suffer any
                  annoyance, to retain the unhappy girl within her own warm, loving sympathies. And
                  Nettie,—how gratefully her heart expanded in this genial home. Here she was
                  understood and appreciated; and here, too, she would be saved, if possible, from
                  the terrible sacrifice to which her mother had doomed her. So they had assured
                  her; and her pure faith (save when some paroxysm of grief, such as Becky had that
                  morning witnessed, overmastered her) rested on their promises with shadowy
                  hope.</p>
               <p>At Willow Glen, too, where an earlier love claimed its treasure, Nettie was folded
                  to hearts that throbbed responsively to her grief. Again, as of old, her head was
                  drawn upon Aunt Lottie's breast, and words of soothing love fell upon the troubled
                  heart beneath. It was her native atmosphere; and with each breath Nettie inhaled
                  strength from those loving souls. What sacrifice could they deem too great, thus
                  to minister to the precious one! So Albert Atherton's presence became even
                  tolerable for his sister's sake.</p>
               <p>He had not been slow to follow up the advantage he fancied he had gained in his
                  first call at Woodbine Lodge; but could he have read the motives which induced
                  their kindness to him, his step had been less lofty, his manner less triumphant,
                  among those who understood him so well. Thus weeks sped on; weeks, fraught with
                  quiet happiness to Nettie, freed from the persecution of her unnatural mother, and
                  surrounded by love—weeks, in which every gracious word and look was interpreted by
                  Albert as favoring his suit, till he came to believe in the certainty of his
                  success—weeks, on whose daily wings little messengers of love came to the heart,
                  and brightened the eye and cheek of Richard Morton's betrothed—weeks, which at
                  length brought the announcement of visitors; none other than Richard, his friend
                  Mr. Ashton, and Nettie's lover, Mr. Selwyn. Nettie would not have flown so like a
                  frightened bird to her Aunt Lottie's arms, had she known that in the lover she
                  would find also a <emph>deliverer.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Woodbine Lodge! home of the Graces! Cupid's chosen haunt!" gayly apostrophized
                  Mr. Ashton, as the three gentlemen approached Miss Mowbray's beautiful
                  residence;—"how shall I best propitiate the fickle god?"</p>
               <p>"By acknowledging his power," Richard replied, laughing.</p>
               <p>"What if I have never felt it—do not even believe in its existence? you two
                  lovesick swains to the contrary notwithstanding," rejoined the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Look out for yourself, then—his shafts may reach<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000117"/> you when least expected."—Even as Richard spoke,
                  the little sly archer had sped his arrow from a pair of black eyes watching their
                  approach.</p>
               <p>"Heavens! what queenly face is that?" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Ashton, as he caught
                  the glance.</p>
               <p>"Where?" eagerly cried Richard, who had been scanning every window; "oh, that is
                  Miss Mowbray, the heiress."</p>
               <p>"I detest heiresses," was the lawyer's short response, as they alighted at the
                  door. He did not see the flashing of those black eyes, as his remark was
                  overheard, or heed the mischievous smile lurking round the lips which bade him
                  welcome; but he did see and feel that before him stood the most beautiful woman
                  his eye had ever rested upon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Selwyn paced the drawing-room at Willow Glen with agitated steps. He had come
                  to hear from Nettie's own lips the truth of what Richard had told him. Her
                  mother's assurance of the young girl's love for him had led to his proposal and
                  acceptance; though, strange to say, he now awaited the first tte--tte with his
                  affianced.</p>
               <p>"Strange," said he to himself, as he thought of the past, "that I should have
                  given my heart so wholly to her without reading the response of her own—but she
                  was very lovely. Perhaps, after all, young Morton is mistaken. I cannot give her
                  up, no, never," he murmured, wiping his eye.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a glittering object attracted his attention, and for a moment he stood
                  transfixed before it;—"A mother's legacy," he repeated, at length, "just what
                     <emph>my own</emph> mother would say to me now. It is enough. I will receive it
                  as from her, and pledge my heart to the test."</p>
               <p>Fearful and hesitating, Nettie entered the room.</p>
               <p>"My poor, trembling dove," Mr. Selwyn exclaimed, as he took her cold hand in his,
                  while he gazed affectionately into her pale, sad face, "I must bring back the
                  roses to these cheeks."</p>
               <p>"I have been quite ill," Nettie stammered.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear child, I know you have," said he, tenderly. "Mr. Morton has told me
                  all.</p>
               <p>"All!" she gasped, looking up eagerly to his face for the first time.</p>
               <p>"Yes, all," he repeated, smiling sadly; "and think you, Nettie, I would bind your
                  fresh young life to my years, if your heart were not mine?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir," she began in a broken voice, "I would have told you before,
                  but—but—"</p>
               <p>"I understand, my sweet girl," said he, relieving her embarrassment, "you have
                  been governed by another's will. But now that your words have destroyed the little
                  lingering hope in my breast, I pray you, receive me as a friend, Nettie, a friend
                  such as you need, and in whom you may confide."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I thank you, I bless you for that, sir," cried Nettie, quickly laying her
                  hand into the one he extended towards her; "I can love you dearly as such a
                  friend; but my mother!—what will she say?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind her now, dear child; we will talk of<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000118"/> that when I have heard from your own lips what
                  young Morton partly told me."</p>
               <p>Melville Thornton was astonished! absolutely and unqualifiedly astonished, when,
                  an hour later, he came upon the lovers unawares, to find Nettie chatting gayly;
                  the old look of joy returned to her eyes; the smiling blushes to her cheeks; and
                  Mr. Selwyn, unwelcome lover as he supposed him to be, listening to her with quiet
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"I've changed my mind about him," was her very demure reply to all their
                  inquiries; and so they puzzled more and more, that the disconsolate maiden should
                  suddenly have become reconciled to her fate. Ah! Nettie kept well her secret; for
                  the noble plan Mr. Selwyn proposed to her required it. So they two alone knew
                  whither they were tending.</p>
               <p>"Can I have a few moments' private conversation with you this evening, Miss
                  Mowbray?" One would have thought it was a queen he addressed, so respectfully did
                  Albert Atherton prefer his request.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Atherton, if you wish."</p>
               <p>Such was the cause which brought these two persons together in Miss Mowbray's
                  boudoir one evening.</p>
               <p>"We go to-morrow," Albert began in a voice he <emph>intended</emph> should be
                  tremulous; "but I cannot leave this place, where I have found the only true
                  happiness I ever knew, till I have made a confession by which I may for ever lose
                  your esteem;" he paused, looking towards her for some sign of encouragement; but,
                  receiving none, he continued: "I need not refer to those past scenes with which
                  you are already familiar, and which, standing alone, might condemn me; but I ask
                  you to look with compassion on the sufferings I have since endured—the long months
                  spent in penitence and humility; and say if aught in that past still remains in
                  your heart against me."</p>
               <p>"I am not your judge, Mr. Atherton," was Miss Mowbray's only reply, as he waited
                  for ner words.</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>are</emph> my judge,—my arbitress," he eagerly exclaimed; "for upon
                  one word of yours hangs the happiness or misery of my future life. Say, then, oh,
                  say that I am not indifferent to you; that the heart so devotedly yours may at
                  last find its home in your breast. Prove me, Miss Mowbray, prove my love as you
                  will; but give me some hope, some assurance, that you will be mine at last! my
                  bride! my wife!"</p>
               <p>"Leave this strain; I cannot listen to it a moment longer," said Miss Mowbray
                  indignantly; "this house, at least, where dwells the mother of Agnes, should be
                  sacred from your perjured vows; your bride is in her grave, where you placed
                  her—go, prepare to join her there."</p>
               <p>When Albert looked up bewildered, he was alone; yet not alone; for there again was
                  the cold shadow creeping around him—its arms closer and closer enfolding him in
                  its dark embrace. Out beneath the midnight sky it led him; and on, on through
                  unknown paths still the weird figure bore him along, till nature could endure the
                  struggle no longer, and he fell senseless to the earth. There, crouching over his
                     pros<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7276-00000119"/> trate form, still brooded the
                  unceasing watcher for its prey.</p>
               <p>Morning dawned, and with it, Nettie, bright and joyous, prepared to accompany Mr.
                  Selwyn, no longer the dreaded lover, to her home—that home which for her had but
                  one joy—her father's smile.</p>
               <p>"What a strange, unaccountable being you are," whispered Miss Mowbray, imprinting
                  a parting kiss on her glowing cheek; "one would think you had forgotten the
                  absent."</p>
               <p>"He will find I have not forgotten him," Nettie proudly answered, as she gave her
                  hand to Mr. Selwyn, and leaped lightly into the carriage which bore them away.</p>
               <p>"What does it all mean?" was as plainly written on the faces of those that watched
                  their departure, as it was spoken by Miss Singleton.</p>
               <p>"What do you refer to?" said Mr. Ashton; "I do not see any thing very strange
                  about them."</p>
               <p>"Has not Richard told you," asked Miss Singleton, "that Nettie was ready to die
                  rather than marry this Mr. Selwyn, or any other, except the one to whom she was
                  engaged, and yet here she goes off with him as happy as you please!"</p>
               <p>"What is there remarkable about that?" he replied, laughing; "does it follow that
                  she is going to marry him, because she accepts his escort home, or seems so
                  artlessly happy with him?"</p>
               <p>"No, not that exactly," Miss Singleton hesitated, "but she so dreaded to see him,
                  and now he seems to hold some charm over her."</p>
               <p>"It is the charm of a noble heart," said Mr. Ashton; "Selwyn would never wed an
                  unwilling bride."</p>
               <p>"Still I feel uneasy about her," whispered Miss Singleton in her lover's ear, as
                  they returned to the parlor.</p>
               <p>"You need not," he replied in the same tone; "I have told him the whole
                  story."</p>
               <p>"About Lonny and all?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, every thing."</p>
               <p>"Then she is safe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, safe in his confidence and honor, I firmly believe; but come, my little
                  questioner, let us walk in the garden now. I have some things to say before I
                  leave, and to-morrow I shall be far away."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashton caught the last words—but what meant the sudden pain, the choking
                  sensation they caused him; why did he involuntarily turn to where Miss Mowbray
                  stood looking from the window in a meditative mood? why did he draw nearer and
                  gaze upon that face which had been a beautiful study to him? Ah! why indeed! when
                  love was "nothing but a foolish delusion," and "heiresses detestable!"</p>
               <p>"Are you really going so soon?" Miss Mowbray quietly remarked, as the lovers left
                  them alone.</p>
               <p>"We so purposed when we left New York," he replied; "but I little dreamed with
                  what reluctance I should return thither."</p>
               <p>If Miss Mowbray felt any surprise she did not manifest it. "Let us then hope,"
                  said she, "that you will again favor Woodbine Lodge with a visit."</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7276-00000120"/>
               <p>"May I flatter myself that such a visit would be agreeable to you?" he asked in a
                  low voice, while every feature betrayed his earnestness.</p>
               <p>Now the hot blood rushed to her face. "Perhaps," said she—and her voice trembled
                  as she spoke, "perhaps you would not ask that question, did you know who I
                  am."</p>
               <p>"Who you are?" he repeated with amazement.</p>
               <p>"Hush! I may not tell you now; she cried, strangely agitated; "but I cannot
                  deceive <emph>you:</emph> I am not what I seem,"—and bursting into tears, she left
                  his astonished presence.</p>

               <p>NEVER was truer, deeper joy felt, than that with which Mark Atherton clasped his
                  precious child to his heart, as he saw from the light on her beautiful face, that
                  the cloud had passed from her. He had never known, for Nettie had uttered no
                  complaint, the full extent of his wife's domestic tyranny, or the extreme measures
                  to which she had resorted to coerce the poor girl's will; but he had seen the
                  sweet face grow daily more pale and sad, and he knew from bitter experience how
                  futile would be all attempts to move the mother's heart to compassion. For himself
                  he had ceased to care for the violent and abusive language with which every effort
                  to enforce his authority had been met by his wife; but he had vowed in his heart
                  that Nettie should not marry, save as her heart dictated, and this vow his wife
                  had laughed to scorn.</p>
               <p>Her extreme satisfaction was, therefore, even greater<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000121"/> than the father's joy, when Nettie returned,
                  smiling as of old, and leaning confidently on the arm of Mrs. Atherton's
                  choice—Mr. Selwyn.</p>
               <p>"There, Mr. Atherton!" was her exulting remark the first time they were alone
                  after Nettie's return; "you see I had the child's happiness more at heart than
                  you! If it hadn't been for my penetration and perseverance, she would have been
                  puling and pining about that beggar yet."</p>
               <p>"Nettie does certainly seem happier," said he, "and that is all I care for; as for
                  that beggar, as you call him, he was a noble fellow, and Nettie should have had
                  him, if she chose."</p>
               <p>"Nettie never should have had him! She should die first!" exclaimed Mrs. Atherton
                  with vehemence.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said her husband, "it is too late to quarrel about that; if Nettie
                  is satisfied, I am."</p>
               <p>"That is all very pretty to say now," she replied tauntingly; "after I have fought
                  such a battle to bring the girl to her senses."</p>
               <p>"She liked to have been brought to her grave!" he answered.</p>
               <p>"Better death than disgrace," was her reply.</p>
               <p>"Say you so?" he cried sharply; "then let me charge you to look well to the son
                  you have trained to despise his father. Is there no disgrace in that?"</p>
               <p>"My son despises, as I do, the mean, grovelling spirit that sees nobility in
                  beggar's rags and filth," Mrs. Atherton replied contemptuously.</p>
               <p>"But he does not despise what should bring a blush to your cheek," Mr. Atherton
                  added with feeling—"the life of a drunkard and debauchee."</p>
               <p>"Very kind words for a father to utter concerning his only son," sneered Mrs.
                  Atherton; "but let me tell you, sir, that with all Albert's faults, he will yet
                  honor a name that I consider his only disgrace."</p>
               <p>"God grant it may be so," said Mr. Atherton, "for he is still my son, though
                  strangely alienated from his father's heart."</p>
               <p>"It is rather late for you to speak of that, after your abuse of him," Mrs.
                  Atherton coolly replied.</p>
               <p>"I do not abuse him: I only speak of what it grieves me to know, of his habits and
                  life," Mr. Atherton said mildly.</p>
               <p>"They are nothing more than young men of spirit are accustomed to," replied his
                  wife. "I would not have him tamely mewed up to his business like Richard
                  Morton."</p>
               <p>"Let me in, I say! let me in," cried a voice from out the midnight darkness, which
                  Mrs. Atherton but too well recognized, as she sprang hastily from her bed and
                  prepared to obey the summons.</p>
               <p>"I hope he will not wake," said she to herself, glancing at her sleeping husband,
                  "for we should only have another lecture about Albert's profligacy—I wonder what
                  has brought him here now; I thought he was at Woodbine Lodge,—perhaps he is the
                  bearer of good news," she thought, as gliding down stairs she quietly unfastened
                  the door.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! Albert, what is the matter!" she<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000122"/> exclaimed with affright, as, pale and haggard, he
                  staggered before her into the family sitting-room.</p>
               <p>"Shut up your head and come in here," said he, "I've got something to say to
                  you"—then carefully bolting the door he threw himself on the sofa, and burst into
                  a low, maniacal laugh.</p>
               <p>"My child! what does this mean!" she cried, trembling violently as she approached
                  him.</p>
               <p>"It means this," said he, springing up and drawing a loaded pistol from his
                  breast—"nay, stay where you are," he added, as she recoiled towards the
                  door,—"stay where you are, or I'll blow my brains out this minute."</p>
               <p>Shaking in every fibre, with a face as white as his own, the mother sank into a
                  chair before her son.</p>
               <p>"Now hear me," said he, his voice hoarse with terrible excitement: "for
                  forty-eight hours I have neither ate, drank, nor slept—all the horrors of the
                  damned are upon me; twice they have dragged me to their burning, yawning pit, but
                  I escaped them; yes, I escaped them,"—he laughed again that dreadful
                  laugh:—"because I wanted to come home and see you—I wanted to <emph>curse</emph>
                  you once before I died—yes, woman," he added, with a terrible oath: "it is all
                  your own work—you have made me what I am—you killed all there was good in me—you
                  crushed my love for Agnes, who might have raised me to her own purity—you maddened
                  my brain with taunts, when I would have repented, and sent me forth on a fool's
                  errand, to be scorned and trod upon. You have made me a murderer derer; a vile,
                  wretched thing, fit only for the infernal regions to which I hasten; and why
                  should I not <emph>curse</emph> you—curse you for giving me birth—for implanting
                  your own dark nature within me—for bringing me at last to this terrible deed"—he
                  pointed significantly to the weapon in his hand.</p>
               <p>Paralyzed with horror, the mother gazed upon her son;—twice, thrice she essayed to
                  speak, but the words froze on her lips. Like a marble statue seemed her rigid,
                  motionless form; but each word he uttered burned with living fire into her
                  soul.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Speak,</emph>" he uttered, and his voice had now the low, calm note of
                  despair; "or, if you have naught to say, listen yet to me. I go to the place for
                  which your false teachings have prepared me;—already the powers of darkness are
                  clutching their prey. I would not see another sun; for my life is accursed. But
                  go, unhappy woman, save that pure being I cannot call sister; give her to him she
                  loves—he cannot be as low as I—if you would hope for one gleam of mercy to your
                  soul. As for me," he continued, raising the pistol to his breast, "this is all
                  that can silence remorse."</p>
               <p>With an unearthly shriek which resounded through the house, the mother's tongue
                  was loosened as she sprang to check the fatal deed. Alas, too late! with that
                  piercing sound, came also to the ears of the awakened sleepers, in the deep
                  midnight silence, the shrill report of death's quick messenger.</p>
               <p>Together they found them,—the mother's outstretched arms still clasping the
                  lifeless form of her son,<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7276-00000123"/> while from
                  his breast oozed a dark stream, crimsoning her garments with a fearful hue. Not a
                  word—not a groan—escaped her lips, as they bore her to her room. For long days and
                  nights in that deathlike swoon she lay,—her hair whitening,—her brow wrinkling, as
                  though ages were passing over her head. Retribution, righteous though terrible,
                  had overtaken her at last; and she lay like a shattered wreck upon its surging
                  billows.</p>
               <p>When twilight deepened into evening, and the busy world had ceased its labors,
                  forth from that proud mansion they bore the body of him who had ruthlessly rushed
                  into the presence of his Maker. No pall, save Heaven's dark, glittering canopy—no
                  weepers, for tearful founts were frozen—no train of friendly, sympathizing hearts
                  to pay their last respectful tribute. Save the father's trembling, tottering
                  steps,—the sister's mute, pale presence—unwept, unloved, unhonored, he went to his
                  lone burial. Silently they laid him in his narrow bed; for who could there breathe
                  the hope of joyful resurrection—who speak in that presence of the blessedness of
                  the pure in heart!</p>
               <p>From her deep trance the mother at last awoke, fearful sounds still ringing in her
                  ears, and searing her brain. As from some frightful dream she awoke, her eyes
                  glaring wildly around, her lips muttering incoherent words.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said a gentle voice beside her, while a soft hand smoothed her burning
                  brow, "do you feel better now?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton looked earnestly into the lovely face bent over her. "Nettie," said
                  she, "is that you? Where am I? It seems as if something terrible had
                  happened."</p>
               <p>"You are ill, dear mother," replied the sweet girl; "try and sleep again—it will
                  quiet your nerves."</p>
               <p>A sudden pang shot through the mother's heart,—memory was fast awaking from its
                  lethargy—"tell me," said she quickly,—"has your brother—has Albert"—she uttered no
                  more; for with that name rushed the full tide of recollection, and she sank back
                  with a deep groan upon her pillow.</p>
               <p>"Here, dear mother, take this, it will help you," said Nettie soothingly, holding
                  to her lips a composing draught the physician had left for a moment like this.</p>
               <p>With an impatient gesture of her hand Mrs. Atherton dashed the cup from her. "Take
                  it away," she whispered, "it will do me no good; I must
                     <emph>think—think—think.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But thinking will only make you worse, mother," Nettie expostulated.</p>
               <p>Her words were unheeded by the prostrate woman, who clasped her hands tightly over
                  her eyes, as if to shut out some frightful vision. In vain, wretched mother! that
                  midnight scene can never be effaced!</p>
               <p>Nettie, patient nurse and watcher, trembled as she saw the dark expression which
                  gathered on her mother's face in this self-communing hour. Quietly she passed into
                  the next room, and, laying her hand on Mr. Selwyn's arm, she said, "come with me;
                  I have yet further<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7276-00000124"/> ther need of your
                  strength." Without a word he rose and followed her to Mrs. Atherton's bedside.</p>
               <p>Most invaluable had been his presence and sympathy, both to father and daughter,
                  through the tragic scenes of which he had been an accidental witness. Nettie
                  leaned upon him with the simple, trustful confidence of a sister, and he was
                  content that it should be so. He had read her young heart, and knew the idol
                  enshrined there; but the pang it had caused him none ever suspected—least of all
                  did the young girl know, how great had been his sacrifice for her happiness.
                  Tenderly as would a cherished brother, he took her hand in his, as they stood
                  beside her mother's bed.</p>
               <p>"When did her reason return?" he whispered.</p>
               <p>"A few moments since," Nettie replied in the same tone. "But see how dreadfully
                  she is suffering."</p>
               <p>"I will remain here with you," said he, quietly seating himself, still retaining
                  her hand.</p>
               <p>Just then Mrs. Atherton unclosed her eyes—she saw them there—Nettie's hand resting
                  in his; and, in the confusion of her brain, she mistook him for another.</p>
               <p>"Why do you stand there to mock me," she cried bitterly: "go, marry the wretch, if
                  you choose; it matters little what becomes of us now." The last words were uttered
                  in a tone of such utter wretchedness, as Mrs. Atherton closed her eyes, that their
                  hearts were deeply touched.</p>
               <p>"Mother," cried Nettie earnestly, "you do not know what you are saying; this is
                  Mr. Selwyn, <emph>your friend,</emph> Mr. Selwyn." Again her eyes unclosed, but
                  they rested upon him with a troubled expression. "Give her to him she loves, if
                  you would hope for one gleam of mercy to your soul," she murmured, repeating
                  Albert's words.</p>
               <p>The listeners exchanged glances—they understood her words;—and hope for a moment
                  shone brightly on Nettie's face, as she bent over the bed. "Mother," said she
                  softly, "will you not do as <emph>he</emph> said? it will make me so very
                  happy."</p>
               <p>Now began the struggle, fierce and terrible, in that mother's heart; they who
                  witnessed it trembled, as they saw the fearful expression it brought to her
                  features. But soon her evil spirit gained the contest; it had reigned too long
                  there to be easily dethroned; and hard and cold was the incrustation it laid over
                  the just rippling waters.</p>
               <p>"Never," she cried, springing up, her eyes dilated with passion; "you think to
                  take advantage of my weakness; but I tell you it shall <emph>never</emph> be,—not
                  if you <emph>curse</emph> me as <emph>he</emph> did with his last breath,—not if
                  it shuts out <emph>for ever</emph> all mercy from my soul. I will not be thwarted
                  in every thing."</p>
               <p>With her mother's first words, Nettie had shrunk back to Mr. Selwyn's side, and a
                  deep groan was her only reply to the unnatural woman.</p>
               <p>"Do not despair," he whispered in her ear. "All will yet be well; only pursue the
                  plan we proposed; and remember that in me you have a firm, unfailing friend."
                  Nettie looked up with a grateful reply, just as he closed the door upon his
                  retreat.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7276-00000125"/>
               <p>"Now, girl," Mrs. Atherton exclaimed when they were alone, "you need not think to
                  elude me longer;—you shall marry Mr. Selwyn this very week."</p>
               <p>"What!" said Nettie, "when we have just put on mourning!" Mrs. Atherton was a
                  punctilious observer of forms.</p>
               <p>"I had forgotten," she replied, "but you shall <emph>pledge</emph> yourself to
                  him, and that, in the presence of witnesses."</p>
               <p>"Wait till Mr. Selwyn wishes for such a pledge," said Nettie; "but oh, mother,"
                  she continued, tears gathering in her eyes, "tell me something of poor Albert's
                  terrible death. I have so longed to know—and you were with him."</p>
               <p>"Never let that name be mentioned in my presence again," Mrs. Atherton replied, in
                  a voice whose icy coldness froze Nettie's blood,—"leave me now, I wish to
                  sleep."</p>
               <p>And Nettie did leave her, but not to sleep,—vainly she struggled with the terrible
                  vision; she buried her head deep in the pillows, to stifle the sound of a wail
                  that came echoing distinctly on her ear—the wail of her first-born's curse. She
                  gnashed her teeth,—she tore her hair in her maddening agony; but still before her,
                  with fearful distinctness, rose that midnight scene. And still shall it ever
                  remain with her, for she turns with scorn from that love, which alone could bring
                  light out of darkness like hers.</p>

               <p>DAISYSIDE wore a saddened look—so Joseph Atherton and his good wife thought—in the
                  absence of the young spirit that had for many years brightened their home. Lonny
                  had been absent several months, and as yet, though they had looked daily and
                  hourly, no message had come from him.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what, Henny," said Joseph, one day, "I believe we shall hear from
                  our boy soon—I had a dream about him, last night."</p>
               <p>"Your dreams about him come in the day, as well as night," she replied, smiling.
                  "I don't believe there's been an hour since he went away, that you haven't thought
                  of him."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact," said he; "but who could help it? the old place doesn't seem like
                  itself without him; and I reckon, wife, your face will look a little more smiling
                  when he comes back."</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7276-00000126"/>
               <p>"I do feel anxious about the poor boy," replied Henrietta with a moistening eye,
                  "I wish he hadn't felt so bad about his parents. I'm sure it would make no
                  difference with us who they were."</p>
               <p>"It's all that plaguy woman's doings," exclaimed Joseph, almost angrily; "she
                  couldn't rest till she had set every body against him: the old vixen!"</p>
               <p>"She didn't set Nettie against him, though; I believe that child loves him as she
                  does her own eyes."</p>
               <p>"Loves him, to be sure she does," Joseph replied, "and she'll marry him yet, in my
                  opinion.—Oh, won't I do the handsome thing by them."</p>
               <p>"I think Mark's wife would rather bury her, than see her marry him," said his
                  wife; "and besides, you know, she has already picked out a husband for
                  Nettie."</p>
               <p>"Let her pick away. It won't do any good, or hurt; I should think the awful lesson
                  she has had, would teach her that her way isn't always the best," said Joseph,
                  putting on his hat to go out. "Whew! who is this coming up the hill?" he added,
                  looking out of the window.</p>
               <p>The object to which their attention was thus directed was, apparently, a young
                  man, though as he came wearily up towards the house, his face was effectually
                  concealed from observation by the slouched cap he had drawn over it; his clothes
                  were soiled and dusty; his step slow and trembling, as from long travel. This was
                  all the worthy couple had time to notice before he reached their door. Joseph
                  Atherton's ever open hand extended its welcome to the tired traveller; but waving
                  it gently aside, the young man passed silently through the open door, to where
                  Henrietta still stood. Then removing his cap from his head, he disclosed the pale
                  and sunken features of him for whom their hearts were longing.</p>
               <p>"Lonny! dear boy, dear boy," shouted Joseph, throwing his great arms around him;
                  while Henrietta's motherly heart overflowed her eyes, as she clasped both his
                  hands in hers, murmuring: "thank God! my child has come at last."</p>
               <p>Oh, how like dew to the thirsty flower came these warm gushings of heartfelt love
                  to Lonny's worn and wearied frame.</p>
               <p>"Bless you, dearest and best of friends," he uttered, "for this warm welcome home!
                  I knew it awaited me here."</p>
               <p>"To be sure you did," said Joseph; "but what makes you look so pale, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"Let me get him something nice and warm to take, and give him some rest, before he
                  tries to talk much," said Henrietta, whose anxious eyes had scanned the troubled
                  face, and read its sorrow well.</p>
               <p>Then, with womanly tact, she drew him into his own little chamber, snowy and
                  spotless as her heart, and bidding him lie down upon its soft cushioned bed, she
                  gently bathed his hands and face, smoothed out the tangled locks, soothing him all
                  the while with her low musical voice, as she chatted cheerfully of all that had
                  passed in his absence. Sweet soporific! nature could not long resist the charm,
                  and Lonny, with still the<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7276-00000127"/> pleasant
                  sound lingering in his ear, sank into a profound slumber, such as he had not known
                  for many months before.</p>
               <p>"That is right," whispered the little woman, approvingly to herself, at this
                  result of her efforts; "sleep will do him more good than any thing else. Poor boy,
                  what can have troubled him so! no matter, he is at home now, and I must drive it
                  all away."</p>
               <p>Noiselessly she took from a drawer some sweet fresh linen, and laid it on a table
                  near the bed—then beside it she placed a suit of new clothes her husband had
                  bought for Lonny, in his absence; over the last she smiled, as she thought of the
                  pleasant surprise it would be to him when he awoke—and then, with one more look at
                  his pale face, one kiss, soft as an angel's, on his forehead, she quietly
                  withdrew, to keep her watchful guard around the silent house.</p>
               <p>Long, long he lay in that calm, peaceful slumber, sweet fancies painting with
                  bright colors his sleeping thoughts, till at last he awoke, with a dear name upon
                  his lips.</p>
               <p>"She'll be yours yet, never fear," said Henrietta's pleasant voice, as he opened
                  his eyes upon her.</p>
               <p>"She! who? what do you mean? how came I here?" he asked, confusedly gazing around
                  him.</p>
               <p>"How came you here? that's a pretty question for a boy to ask his mother," said
                  she, laughing; "you came here because you belonged here, and you'll marry Nettie
                  because you love her."</p>
               <p>The eager, happy look died away on Lonny's face, as he replied, "I shall never
                  marry her, though I do love her as my own soul."</p>
               <p>"We'll talk about that after supper," said Henrietta; "now dress up in these nice
                  clean clothes, and come into the sitting-room with Joseph and me."</p>
               <p>The dear little woman's quiet happiness was contagious; Lonny sprang up lightly,
                  and was soon seated between those who cherished him as their own, looking fresh
                  and invigorated.</p>
               <p>"There, this seems something like," said Joseph, laying his hand on the young
                  man's shoulder, with one of his own hearty smiles; "Henny and I have been terrible
                  lonesome without you, my boy."</p>
               <p>"And I," added Lonny, with feeling, "I have learned anew how dear is this home to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"What did you want to find another one for, then?" Joseph asked, abruptly but
                  kindly.</p>
               <p>"Not another home, uncle Joseph," said Lonny; "for I should never have left you,
                  had I found one; but you know what sent me away."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, my boy," Uncle Joseph replied, delicately refraining from any
                  questions; "but you'll find it hard work to get away from us again."</p>
               <p>"I would that it were not necessary," said Lonny; "but my mission is not yet
                  fulfilled."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean to say that you are going to be so foolish again," Uncle Joseph
                  began, "and"—</p>
               <p>"Now Lonny, don't talk so," chimed in Henrietta; but the young man shook his head
                  sadly:</p>
               <p>"I have made a vow," said he, "and I must not<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000128"/> rest till it is accomplished. My heart would not be
                  denied its longings to see you once more, and therefore I came now; but dearly as
                  I love you—great as would be the joy of remaining in this blessed home, I must
                  again become a stranger and pilgrim."</p>
               <p>"Just because that old vixen called you a 'foundling,'" exclaimed Uncle Joseph,
                  indignantly; "but I wouldn't mind any thing more about it, Lonny; she has got well
                  punished now."</p>
               <p>"It was not merely what your brother's wife said," Lonny replied; "she is but an
                  example of what I meet with every where in society: do you think, Uncle Joseph, I
                  can live calmly on, and let my mother's name and mine rest in infamy?"</p>
               <p>"Infamy!" repeated Uncle Joseph; "because you were left a little friendless
                  orphan, without the means of discovering who your parents were!"</p>
               <p>"The world is not as charitable as you are, Uncle Joseph," said Lonny.</p>
               <p>"Mark's wife may well talk of infamy," continued Joseph, excitedly, "since the
                  terrible disgrace Albert has brought upon her name; but for yours, my boy, you
                  have no need to blush."</p>
               <p>"Neither do I, for any act of my own," Lonny replied, proudly; "but my mother, you
                  know"—he hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Was as good and pure as any mother in the land," added Joseph.</p>
               <p>"I know it—I never doubted it," eagerly cried Lonny; "but how shall I convince the
                  world of it?"</p>
               <p>"What do you care for the world's opinion?" Uncle Joseph asked.</p>
               <p>"I am obliged to care," replied Lonny; "my proud nature cannot brook the taunts,
                  the insulting innuendoes, the cold, averted looks, and colder words, with which
                  the world favors me."</p>
               <p>"Poor boy!" said Uncle Joseph, compassionately; "it is a shame for you to suffer
                  all these. But what can you do? Have you been able to get any clue to what you
                  wish?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot say that I have," Lonny answered; "and yet I am almost sure that I have
                  seen my mother's grave."</p>
               <p>"Where?" cried Uncle Joseph and his wife, in one breath.</p>
               <p>"It is a long way from here," said Lonny, "in a little obscure village away up in
                  one corner of New Hampshire. But, after all, there is no proof it was her
                  grave."</p>
               <p>"How did you happen to go there?" asked Henrietta Atherton.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," Lonny replied. "I followed a sort of dreamy, indistinct
                  remembrance of places where my grandfather and I stayed during our wandering life.
                  Many times, as some object would recall those old associations, I spent weeks
                  vainly endeavoring to find some one who would remember the poor old man and boy.
                  All my efforts proved fruitless till, late one evening, I sought shelter in a
                  poor-looking cottage on the outskirts of a small village. The only inmates were
                     an<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7276-00000129"/> aged couple, who bade me welcome
                  to such as they had, and in return seemed to expect me to answer their endless
                  inquiries. So I told them my story, which immediately brought to their
                  recollection a circumstance which they said occurred many years before. An old man
                  and his wife, with an infant grandchild, came there one day, and begged to remain
                  with them, saying he was able and willing to pay, for a home. They received them,
                  and in about a year the old lady, who had seemed full of trouble and grief, died,
                  and left Paul Brown, as he called himself, with the little child to care for. His
                  money was all gone, and they were not able to help him, so he was taken with the
                  child to the poor-house. He cried piteously not to be sent there, but there seemed
                  to be no other alternative, and after a few months, in which his reason seemed to
                  wander, he escaped, carrying with him the little helpless boy. Search was made for
                  them, but the old man eluded all their efforts to find him, and he was never heard
                  from again.</p>
               <p>"Such was the statement made to me by these people, and hope at once sprang up in
                  my heart that my search would be rewarded at last. But again I was doomed to
                  disappointment; for my most diligent inquiries could elicit nothing further than
                  was first told me. Nobody knew whence old Paul Brown had come, or whither he had
                  gone.</p>
               <p>"On I wandered, till at last, penniless and disheartened, I stopped at a thrifty
                  farmer's, and asked for work to replenish my purse.</p>
               <p>"One Sabbath evening, during my chance residence in this lonely town, I rambled
                  through the grave-yard, and, with a sort of vague curiosity, began to read the
                  epitaphs on the tombstones. Suddenly my eye was attracted to a grave apart from
                  the rest in one corner of the yard; and, going towards it, I read on the beautiful
                  marble slab, 'Sacred to the memory of my wife.' No date—no name was there: a
                  simple iron railing enclosed the lonely spot, made more conspicuous among those
                  neglected graves by the care with which it had been adorned. I cannot describe my
                  sensations as I stood over that grave. I seemed to feel my mother's spirit about
                  me, and, with a longing look at the words, '<emph>my wife,</emph>' I hurried to
                  the farmer's, full of anxious inquiries. From him I learned that she who was
                  buried there had been the only child of a poor couple, living in a small red house
                  which he pointed out to me. She was very beautiful, they said, though wild and
                  gay; and her doting parents thought to make a fine lady of her, by sending her
                  away to school. But it proved her ruin; for she returned to them very suddenly one
                  bitter cold night, and before morning she was a corpse, leaving them a new-born
                  infant as the witness of her shame and degradation. The old folks never held their
                  heads up after that night; and as soon as possible they sold their few effects,
                  and left the town with the child. What ever became of them he (the farmer) never
                  knew; but he heard that the old lady and child died soon after that, and were
                  buried in one grave. To my eager questionings he replied, that the old man's name
                  was Paul<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7276-00000130"/> Jennings, and his daughter's,
                  Alice;—that, some time after she died, a young gentleman, supposed to be her
                  seducer, came in anxious haste to find her,—that he seemed in great distress at
                  her death, and caused the stone with its inscription to be placed at the head of
                  her grave. He told every body that she was his lawful wife; but few believed it,
                  though he appeared to be a very fine young man."</p>
               <p>"I shouldn't be one mite surprised if it was your mother, Lonny," said Uncle
                  Joseph, as the former paused; "your grandfather might have changed his name, you
                  know."</p>
               <p>"I thought of that," replied Lonny. "I thought, too, perhaps he might have told
                  Aunt Lottie something more than I knew. She was with him when he died."</p>
               <p>"That's it! go right off and see Lottie," exclaimed Uncle Joseph.</p>
               <p>"Such was my intention, after I had visited this dear home," Lonny answered; "but
                  we must not be too sanguine; there may be nothing in it, after all; and then I
                  must away to my wearisome search again;" and he sighed deeply.</p>
               <p>"Well, we'll see after you've talked with Aunt Lottie," said Joseph Atherton,
                  echoing the sigh; "but I wish you didn't feel so."</p>
               <p>"For Nettie's sake, as well as my own, I must persevere," Lonny replied.</p>
               <p>"Ah, poor boy! do you know how the old lady means to disappoint you there? but she
                  won't, though, I'll be bound."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Uncle Joseph?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Mark's wife is trying to marry her off to a rich fellow from New York, and
                  the poor child has pined away terribly; so Lottie writes us; but she thinks it
                  will all turn out right."</p>
               <p>"Then, first of all, I must see Nettie," cried Lonny, agitatedly springing up and
                  pacing the room: "she must not feel bound to my dark and uncertain future."</p>
               <p>"Why, boy, can you give her up so easy as that?" asked Uncle Joseph with surprise;
                  "if any body had tried to get my Henny away from me before I was married, they'd
                  had to fight pretty hard, I can tell you."</p>
               <p>"Easy!" repeated Lonny with a bitter smile; "would it be easy, think you, to have
                  your quivering heart torn from your living body! to have your eyes drawn from
                  their sockets, while yet you were enjoying their light! or to leap the yawning
                  chasm, in whose utter darkness you <emph>knew</emph> you must find your living
                  tomb! all these, and more, is it for me to lose Nettie; and yet I would suffer
                  all, to make her happy."</p>

               <p>WITH happy trust Nettie leaned on the arm of her companion, as they returned from
                  a long ramble he had persuaded her to take, to relieve the monotony of her
                  sick-bed attendance. Mr. Selwyn still lingered at the Athertons; he could not
                  bring himself to leave the sweet girl in her troubles; and Nettie, with an almost
                  broken-hearted father to soothe, a querulous, ill-tempered, exacting mother to
                  nurse, found herself often overtasked: then it was, that the deep, sympathetic
                  heart, the strong, unwearying arm of her new friend softened those cares, and drew
                  forth her warmest gratitude. Their perfect understanding with each other threw off
                  her reserve; and when, as was often the case, he led her away from her cares
                  through the green fields and woods, her glad heart poured its melody into his
                  soul, and made him rejoice in the happiness he had helped create.</p>
               <p>Thus had they rambled one day, Nettie's glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes
                  breathing their inward peace around her, when, as they passed the old hut whose
                  ruins still stood where Paul Brown's last home was found, a deep groan arrested
                  their steps.</p>
               <p>"What can that mean?" exclaimed Mr. Selwyn, while Nettie clung closer to his arm.
                  "It must be some one in distress," he added; "will you fear to remain here while I
                  go in and see?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; certainly not," Nettie replied cheerfully; "I was a little startled at
                  first; but go at once; and if I can be of any service, call me."</p>
               <p>Mr. Selwyn gently pushed the half-open door upon its rusty hinges, which gave way,
                  and it fell with a crash to the earth.</p>
               <p>"Emblematical!" cried a voice from within, which he saw, to his surprise,
                  proceeded from a well-dressed, fine-looking young man.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Selwyn, drawing back; "I thought I heard a sound as
                  of some one in distress."</p>
               <p>"You were not mistaken," replied the other; "I could not repress the groan which
                  burst from my lips—I am miserable."</p>
               <p>"And why so? can I not offer you some consolation, some sympathy in your trouble?"
                  Mr. Selwyn advanced as he said this.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You!</emph>" cried the young man bitterly; "it is <emph>you</emph> who have
                  taken from me all the joy of my life."</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7276-00000132"/>
               <p>"What mean you?" Mr. Selwyn exclaimed with astonishment, and "who are you, to say
                  this?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell you who I am, and then perhaps you will understand," said the young
                  man, coming close to him and whispering in his ear.</p>
               <p>"Thank heaven!" was Mr. Selwyn's only reply, as he went to the door and beckoned
                  to Nettie.</p>
               <p>With a timid, half trembling step she obeyed; but it needed no second glance, no
                  word, to convince him to whose heart she was at once enfolded, that he held there
                     <emph>his own.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"This seems like some strange, incomprehensible dream," said he at length; "it
                  cannot be real; Nettie, light of my soul, <emph>speak</emph>—tell me that it is
                  your living, breathing self, that I thus clasp to my heart."</p>
               <p>"Look at me, Lonny," said the young girl, raising her glowing face to his; "you
                  could not mistake <emph>me</emph> for a spirit, could you?" and she smilingly
                  withdrew from his embrace.</p>
               <p>"But your lover, Nettie"—he pointed towards the door where Mr. Selwyn had
                  disappeared at their first meeting.</p>
               <p>"Is here," she replied with a sweet smile.</p>
               <p>"Yet I saw you walking with him so affectionately, so happy—"</p>
               <p>"That you thought I had lost all remembrance of him to whom my heart is pledged,"
                  said Nettie, finishing his sentence.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Nettie; I do not wish you to feel <emph>pledged</emph> to me—I came here to
                  tell you this, when I heard that you were sought by one whom your friends
                  approved; but when I saw you with him—saw your happy smiles bestowed on him, my
                  heart groaned in its agony. Oh, Nettie, my life, how can I give thee up?"</p>
               <p>"Will you still compel me to <emph>seek</emph> instead of being
                     <emph>sought,</emph>" replied Nettie, earnestly; "once have I given you my
                  unasked hand, now again do I repeat the act, and call Heaven to witness, that none
                  other shall ever receive it."</p>
               <p>"Bless you for ever for those words, Nettie!" cried he, clasping her hand within
                  his own burning palms; "but who is he your parents would have you wed?"</p>
               <p>"One whom you will love and honor when you know him," she replied; "but you shall
                  hear from his own lips the story of our <emph>engagement,</emph>" and with a
                  smiling emphasis on the last word, she called Mr. Selwyn within the hut.</p>
               <p>There, where childhood's dark hours had passed so wearily over him, Lonny saw the
                  sacrifice his happiness had caused a noble heart; he, the outcast, was deemed
                  worthy a gem kings might covet.</p>
               <p>What wonder that Mr. Selwyn dashed the fast-flowing tears from his eyes, as the
                  happy lovers called down blessings upon his head; or felt, that even the
                  possession of Nettie's hand could not bring such pure unalloyed bliss as now
                  glowed within his breast. His noble deed had brought its own reward. Lonny stepped
                  with light and joyous tread from the hut he had entered full of misery—the world
                  was all bright before him now.<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7276-00000133"/> Nettie's
                  loving smile had cast its radiance about him, and lo! his darkness turned to
                  light.</p>
               <p>"I may not return with you," said he, as the three walked towards Mr. Atherton's;
                  "never must I enter your home, Nettie, till I can present to your proud mother a
                  name as worthy as her own."</p>
               <p>"Which I have no doubt you will soon do," added Mr. Selwyn, encouragingly; "looks
                  do not often belie one, and I see in yours a noble origin."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," replied Lonny, with a beaming eye; "that is all that is now wanting
                  to complete my felicity; but for you, Mr. Selwyn, how can I express the deep
                  reverence with which your name will ever dwell in my heart; <emph>earth</emph> has
                  no reward for deeds like yours—in Heaven alone can such be found."</p>
               <p>"I am already richly repaid in witnessing your happiness," said Mr. Selwyn;
                  "besides, the rule by which I have endeavored to be guided, does not teach us to
                  look for earthly reward. You owe more than you suspect to your friends at Willow
                  Glen."</p>
               <p>"How is that," Nettie asked with curiosity; "did Aunt Lottie talk with you about
                  us?"</p>
               <p>"Only in a silent way," Mr. Selwyn replied, smiling; "I had almost concluded to
                  secure a beautiful prize, which had been promised me, even against her own wishes,
                  when my eye accidentally fell upon the exquisite piece of workmanship on Mrs.
                  Thornton's drawing-room mantel; for a moment I was almost overcome by the peculiar
                  adaptation of those golden words to my case. They brought my own mother's
                  teachings, too, so vividly before me that I resolved at once to abide by them, and
                  I bless God, who gave me strength to do so."</p>
               <p>"Aunt Lottie should be canonized," eagerly exclaimed Lonny, as Mr. Selwyn ceased.
                  "She is a saint on earth; at least she has been such to me—for, from first to
                  last, my blessings have all seemed to come through her."</p>
               <p>"I am not surprised that you are so enthusiastic in her praise," said Mr. Selwyn,
                  with a significant glance at Nettie; "she has preserved for you a rare
                  treasure."</p>
               <p>"There her praise must be shared by you, sir," gratefully replied Lonny; "but now
                  I must leave my 'treasure' with you for a time, happy in the peaceful security
                  your protection will afford her."</p>
               <p>"Nettie, you have chosen well," was Mr. Selwyn's only remark, as they watched
                  Lonny's receding steps, till he disappeared from their sight.</p>
               <p>Wrapped in delicious dreams—forgetful even for a time of the momentous subject
                  which had drawn him thither, Lonny reached Willow Glen and received the cordial
                  welcome of its inmates.</p>
               <p>"What has become of the cloud that was on your face when I saw you last?"
                  Charlotte Thornton asked playfully.</p>
               <p>"It has turned its silver lining towards you now," he replied in the same tone;
                  "nevertheless the cloud is still there."</p>
               <p>"But if it could always be <emph>thus</emph> concealed," she added, "you would
                  seem much happier."</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7276-00000134"/>
               <p>"Rather let it be removed, and then the seeming would become reality," said Lonny
                  with emotion.</p>
               <p>"That is right," cried Mr. Thornton; "go beneath the surface if you would have a
                  good foundation on which to build."</p>
               <p>"And that is precisely what I came to you for," said Lonny, turning to Aunt
                  Lottie; "the foundation on which I can alone build any earthly happiness is my
                  parentage."</p>
               <p>"How can <emph>I</emph> help you in that?" she asked with surprise.</p>
               <p>"You were with my grandfather when he died," Lonny replied; "did he say nothing to
                  you concerning my birth—my father?"</p>
               <p>"He tried to, I have no doubt," said Aunt Lottie; "but death closed his lips ere
                  he could utter what he seemed so anxious to tell me."</p>
               <p>"How it might have changed all my life, had he but done me that justice," said
                  Lonny, mournfully; "Heaven only knows now where my trials will end."</p>
               <p>"In Heaven, at least, they will," cheerfully replied Aunt Lottie; "and
                     <emph>here,</emph> if you can only teach your heart its hardest
                  lesson,—submission."</p>
               <p>"Submission to what?" he asked bitterly.</p>
               <p>"To Him who suffers this dark cloud to rest upon you; and in whose chastenings
                  there is oft a blessing hid," said Aunt Lottie, with tender earnestness.</p>
               <p>"You, whose life is a blessing to every one with whom you meet, may talk of
                  submission," he replied; "but can <emph>I,</emph> ought I, to sit tamely down and
                  submit my name, my <emph>mother's</emph> name, to be coupled with epithets that
                  bring the burning blush of shame to my cheek? can I submissively bend to the fiat
                  which <emph>society</emph> sends forth against such as I! No! I will
                     <emph>die</emph> first," he added with fearful emphasis.</p>
               <p>"You are right, Lonny," cried Mr. Thornton with irrepressible emotion; "you have
                  struck a long hidden chord in my breast; never rest while an imputation remains on
                  the name of one you love."</p>
               <p>"Your words strengthen my resolution, sir," said Lonny. "I have vowed and cannot
                  go back. But I must confess my disappointment in not finding here the aid I
                  hoped."</p>
               <p>"You mean in reference to your grandfather's communication to my wife."</p>
               <p>"I do, sir."</p>
               <p>"Why, Lonny," said Aunt Lottie, "I should have told you long ago, if he had given
                  me any clue to your birth. But you have not yet told us the result of your efforts
                  the last six months."</p>
               <p>"There is nothing to tell you," he replied, smiling sadly; "at least, nothing that
                  can be proved. If instead of Brown my grandfather's name had been Paul Jennings, I
                  might—"</p>
               <p>"Paul Jennings!" repeated Mr. Thornton, interrupting him, "what do you know of
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"In a little town where I stopped," said Lonny, "I heard some things connected
                  with a family of that name which interested me strangely, and led me almost<pb
                     n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7276-00000135"/> to think he and Paul Brown were the
                  same, and his unfortunate daughter my mother."</p>
               <p>"What did you hear?" Mr. Thornton asked, in a voice whose startling earnestness
                  caused his wife to look up with surprise into his agitated face. Lonny was no less
                  astonished, as he replied,—</p>
               <p>"It was a simple story, sir—an old couple of that name had an only daughter, whose
                  beauty proved her ruin, and their disgrace. She came home one night, after a long
                  absence, and the next day they laid her in the church-yard—their aged heads bowed
                  with grief and shame. Soon they fled from the scene of their humiliation, carrying
                  with them the babe their daughter had left."</p>
               <p>"Go on," said Mr. Thornton, as Lonny paused.</p>
               <p>"There is little more to be told," said Lonny; "but that is the brightest part of
                  the picture. Soon after the old people had left the place, a young man appeared,
                  who claimed to be the <emph>husband</emph> of the unfortunate girl; and, as if to
                  satisfy all doubts, placed a headstone at her grave, with the inscription, 'Sacred
                  to the memory of <emph>my wife.</emph>' Great search was made for those who fled,
                  but no tidings of them could ever be found."</p>
               <p>"What made you think that Paul Brown and that old man might be the same?"
                  Charlotte Thornton asked, as a suspicion of the cause of her husband's agitation
                  crossed her mind.</p>
               <p>"It was merely a surmise, and must ever remain so, I suppose," Lonny replied; "but
                  some thirty or forty miles from the place where this occurred, I heard that an old
                  man, calling himself Paul Brown, had about that time brought his wife and
                  grandchild to a retired cottage, where they remained till she died; that then he
                  was taken to the poor-house, from which he fled with the child, and was never
                  heard from afterwards. That that was my grandfather, there can be no doubt, and I
                  had a faint hope that you could help me identify him as the same Paul
                  Jennings."</p>
               <p>"It does almost look as if it were so," said Aunt Lottie.</p>
               <p>"Paul Jennings' grandchild died," said Mr. Thornton, with a significant look,
                  which his wife understood.</p>
               <p>"It is very likely," Lonny replied; "but as I knelt over that grave, my mother's
                  spirit seemed so near me, I involuntarily drew forth her miniature, to see if it
                  did not smile upon me."</p>
               <p>"Your mother's miniature! let me see it;" and Mr. Thornton nervously grasped the
                  case Lonny held towards him.</p>
               <p>"Alice! my wife!" he almost shrieked. "Great God! what does this mean!" Then, with
                  sudden inspiration, catching the bewildered young man to his heart, he cried out:
                  "By what miracle thou hast been saved, I know not; but thou art Alice's
                     child—<emph>and mine!</emph>"</p>

               <p>"A COLD, drizzling rain,—wind east—about the 20th of September—prospect of a
                  pretty stiff equinoctial."</p>
               <p>Such were Mr. Ashton's observations one morning, as he betook himself to his
                  cheerful grate and dreamy thoughts. These fits of musing,—these reveries, had
                  grown strangely upon him of late. His young partner, Richard Morton, had known him
                  to sit thus for hours, quite unconscious of what was passing around him. It must
                  be a very perplexing law case, that requires such intense thought. Perhaps—but we
                  will listen, as he sits there alone this rainy morning, his feet perched high
                  above the glowing coals, his head thrown back, and eyes closed,—a most lawyer-like
                  position, certainly—favorable both to the intellect and—client.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what she did mean," said he, for at least the hundredth time within the
                  last three months, "Pshaw! what do I care whether she is what she seems or not;
                  she is nothing to me, and never will be. (Unfortunate client!) Yet her words
                  puzzle me more and more, the longer I think of them. (A perplexing law-case,
                  certainly!) I ought really to have asked an explanation of them; but somehow her
                  agitation affected me strangely. Heigho! what a dull place New York is getting to
                  be!—ladies so insipid, and the men all falling in love, or getting married. What a
                  splendid wife <emph>she</emph> would make some one! I verily believe I should
                  knock down the first man that asked her,—and yet I wouldn't marry her myself; she
                  is an heiress; and, besides—ha—ha—ha—Lewis Ashton talk about marrying any one! he
                  must be blindfolded first."</p>
               <p>"You seem to be making yourself very merry in your comfortable easy chair, this
                  most uncomfortable morning," said Richard Morton, coming in at that moment, with a
                  package of letters in his hand;—"pray, allow me to share your happy thoughts."</p>
               <p>"Rather, let me share your pleasant news," replied the lawyer, glancing, it must
                  be confessed, with longing eyes, at the delicate missive from Woodbine Lodge.</p>
               <p>"I have just taken them from the office," said Richard, seating himself, and
                  breaking the seal of one which looked like a business document.</p>
               <p>"Children always eat the best first," said Mr. Ashton, pointing significantly to a
                  letter Richard had laid aside from the rest.</p>
               <p>"But we older ones always preserve the choicest dish for our dessert," Richard
                  replied, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Now you are caught, sir," said Mr. Ashton, laughing; "by your own confession your
                  love-feast is fit only<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7276-00000137"/> for a
                  dessert—something which can easily be dispensed with,—nothing nourishing or
                  substantial about it."</p>
               <p>"You ought certainly to be a judge, sir," said Richard with a mischievous look,
                  "for you have been sitting at that same unsubstantial feast for some time."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Me!</emph> what do you mean?" Mr. Ashton was thoroughly astonished.</p>
               <p>"That you are in love, of course," Richard laughingly replied.</p>
               <p>"And pray, who is the fortunate object?" asked the lawyer with mock seriousness,
                  laying his hand over his heart.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray," was Richard's short reply, as he sank back in his chair, and gave
                  himself up to the perusal of his letters, leaving the lawyer to digest the truth
                  in silence.</p>
               <p>And he did digest it, bitter morsel though it was, till his quickening pulse and
                  throbbing heart warned him of the burning fever within. Away flew busy thought at
                  once, where of late it had so often wandered, and Mr. Ashton was again buried in
                  one of his reveries.</p>
               <p>"I must go to Boston!"</p>
               <p>Richard's sudden exclamation brought the lawyer to his feet. "Why to Boston?" he
                  asked.</p>
               <p>"My father's family are in deep trouble."</p>
               <p>"Who is that in trouble?" asked Mr. Selwyn, coming in.</p>
               <p>"My parents, sir," Richard answered: "it seems that my eldest sister has eloped
                  with one who she supposed was a titled foreigner, but who turns out to be a
                  notorious villain, who has swindled my father out of all his property, and left
                  him nothing but a debtor's prison."</p>
               <p>"Cannot the fellow be caught?"</p>
               <p>"He is half-way across the Atlantic by this time," said Richard, "and besides, he
                  has accomplices who would screen him from the law. But only think,—my father in
                  prison!" he added, with deep emotion.</p>
               <p>"Let me go with you, Morton," said Mr. Selwyn; "my purse needs lightening, and
                  besides, I have news which calls me in that direction, too."</p>
               <p>"The same that Maggie writes me, I presume," said Richard, "about Mr. Thornton
                  discovering a son in young Brown."</p>
               <p>"Yes; isn't that wonderful?" asked Mr. Selwyn with a gratified smile.</p>
               <p>"What's that! young Brown Mr. Thornton's son!" exclaimed Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>"So it seems,—his child by an early marriage. He always supposed the boy died in
                  infancy, but by some strange means he has just discovered, that this young man is
                  his son."</p>
               <p>"And you seem pleased, Selwyn," Mr. Ashton queried.</p>
               <p>"I am most heartily so, I assure you," Mr. Selwyn replied with a beaming eye;
                  "indeed, I know of nothing which could have gratified me more."</p>
               <p>"You are a perfect enigma to me, Selwyn. Ever since you and Miss Atherton had that
                  long tte--tte,<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7276-00000138"/> you have seemed as happy
                  as any successful lover might be expected to; and yet you have ceased to talk to
                  me about marriage settlements,—and now comes up a most formidable rival, whom you
                  know she loved even in his less prosperous days, and you rejoice over it, 'most
                  heartily.' O love! what art thou but an empty sound!"</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to insinuate that I do not love Nettie Atherton?" Mr. Selwyn asked,
                  with a pretended offence.</p>
               <p>"Now hear the fellow! Yes, I do."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to say, that you were never more mistaken in your life," Mr. Selwyn
                  replied very coolly.</p>
               <p>"Selwyn, I do believe you are out of your senses. Now, answer me yea or nay,—are
                  you engaged to Miss Atherton?" and Mr. Ashton bent his keen gaze upon the
                  other.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am engaged to her," was Mr. Selwyn's replay, after a moment's pause.</p>
               <p>"And yet, 'nothing could have gratified you more' than that this old lover of hers
                  should have turned out a fit match for her, even in her aristocratic mother's
                  estimation."</p>
               <p>"That is all true, too," said Mr. Selwyn with provoking calmness.</p>
               <p>"Then what in the name of reason do you expect will come of all this?" Mr. Ashton
                  asked excitedly.</p>
               <p>"Nothing but happiness," responded Mr. Selwyn, smiling; "but come, come, Ashton,
                  how can you expect to know any thing of the heart's phases—you, the skeptic—the
                  unbeliever?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps an unbeliever, but not <emph>untouched,</emph>" Richard added with a
                  quick smile, as he prepared to leave.</p>
               <p>"What! off so soon?" exclaimed Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I cannot rest till I have seen my father."</p>
               <p>"Then we will place our card—'absent on business,' at the door, for I am going
                  with you."</p>
               <p>"You?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I must offer my congratulations to Mr. Thornton; he was an old friend of
                  mine, you know, and—"</p>
               <p>"And Woodbine Lodge is quite near Willow Glen," said Richard, finishing his
                  sentence.</p>
               <p>"Come, come; none of your suspicions, Morton," said Mr. Ashton, coloring; "you are
                  not as wise as you think yourself."</p>
               <p>"We shall see," replied Richard, arranging his papers.</p>
               <p>Alone, in a comfortless, carpetless, scantily furnished room, an old man sat, his
                  head buried in his hands, his chest convulsively heaving with its intense emotion.
                  It was not that he had wrecked the happiness and life of a fair young girl;—it was
                  not that he had defrauded the poor till his name had become a terror to them;—it
                  was not that he had lived a life of duplicity and meanness,—not that he had cast
                  off his only son by harsh, ill usage, destroyed by his own example and teachings
                  the happiness and honor of his daughter; no,<pb n="268-269"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000139"/> all these Judge Morton had done, and yet the world
                  smiled upon him in his princely home. But now that, through another's wickedness,
                  he had become <emph>impoverished,</emph> the prison was his home, felons his
                  companions; while they who had fawned upon him in the days of his prosperity,
                  turned from the miserable <emph>debtor</emph> with scorn and loathing. In crowds
                  they could flock at the sound of the auctioneer's hammer, within his splendid
                  mansion, but not one among them all would stretch forth his hand to alleviate the
                  sufferings of the unhappy man. Such was the world's friendship,—that for which he
                  had lived and toiled; and now—bitter lesson—he was learning its worth. Wife and
                  child had gone from him, to seek support among their friends; alone he stood, like
                  the blackened remains of some lightning-blasted tree.</p>
               <p>"Father!"—the gentle voice reached not his ear, so filled with discordant
                  sounds.</p>
               <p>"Father!"—and a hand was laid lightly upon his shoulder, which caused his bowed
                  head to turn languidly towards the speaker.</p>
               <p>"Richard, my son!"</p>
               <p>How in a moment flashed his whole life before him, as the father fell on his son's
                  neck and wept!</p>
               <p>"This is indeed dreadful!" exclaimed Richard, gazing on the wasted form, and
                  sunken, haggard features of his father; "believe me, sir, I hastened to you the
                  moment I learned your misfortune."</p>
               <p>"And is it <emph>you,</emph> Richard, that comes to me thus;—you, who, more than
                  all others, have reason to curse my name?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! do not speak so! remember you are my father," said Richard; "now we must
                  hasten to remove you from this place at once."</p>
               <p>"That is impossible," sighed Judge Morton.</p>
               <p>"How so? it is for debt alone you are confined here?" Richard asked, almost
                  fearfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but that is the most hopeless of all thraldom."</p>
               <p>Well might the judge say this, as before his memory rose the many wasted lives
                     <emph>he</emph> had caused to be spent here.</p>
               <p>"We will try not to have it so in your case," said Richard, cheerfully. "Come now
                  into more comfortable quarters, and then you shall give me the names of your
                  principal creditors, and the amount."</p>
               <p>"You forget, I cannot leave this place," said the judge, with a bitter smile;
                  "your father is a prisoner."</p>
               <p>"But you can leave on bail," said Richard, "and that is already secured;
                  come."</p>
               <p>It was astonishing to see the change which the appearance of a <emph>friend</emph>
                  had created in favor of the prisoner. The officers bowed with respectful
                  deference, as Judge Morton passed out, leaning on the arm of his son. Not until
                  they reached the hotel, and he found himself in a luxurious apartment, did he
                  realize the change that son had wrought.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Richard, "we must to business, at once; tell me, as nearly as you can,
                  the amount of your liabilities."</p>
               <p>"Ten thousand dollars."</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7276-00000140"/>
               <p>"What! after the sale of all your effects? your house and furniture?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the judge, moodily; "that fellow cheated me out of all my
                  property."</p>
               <p>Richard bit his lips; he was not prepared for such a statement.</p>
               <p>"Well," said he at length, "we must make the best of it—now give me the names of
                  your creditors; I will see every one of them. I have nothing, you know—nothing but
                  what these hands can earn. But, father," he added, looking earnestly at him, "are
                  you willing to labor with me? can you endure to begin life again, in a humble
                  way?"</p>
               <p>An agonizing groan burst from the judge's lips.</p>
               <p>"I know it must cost you a terrible struggle," said Richard, compassionately; "I
                  wish it were in my power to save you from it; but, father, I will always remain
                  with you, to lighten your cares, if you desire it. Think of it now, while I am
                  gone, and then we will together plan our future."</p>
               <p>Think! ah, Richard need not bid him do that; his thoughts were his bitterest
                  enemies; and now they came trooping upon him in wild confusion and dismay. All day
                  long (for Richard's was no quick task) he paced the soft carpeted floor, more
                  intolerable to him than his prison boards; now vowing in his rage that he will
                  return and die in his cell, rather than brave the world's sneer, and become
                  dependent on the son he had cast from him; then, as a flood of tender
                  recollections swept over him, and he saw that son, ever dutiful, ever affectionate
                  tionate, calmly and steadfastly pursuing his noble course, and now coming as a
                  ministering angel to redeem the father who had despised him, falling on his knees,
                  with streaming eyes he would call Heaven to witness, that he would yet prove
                  worthy such a child. His physical frame, exhausted by long trials, could illy
                  endure such intense agitation; and when Richard returned, he found his father
                  tossing wildly upon the bed; a burning fever raging through his veins. To watch
                  beside him in the long delirium which followed, to listen to sickening details of
                  crime long since committed, to live over again the disgraceful family scenes which
                  he had often witnessed, to hear his own name coupled with dreadful epithets, and
                  then appealed to in tones of childish entreaty, were trials from which Richard
                  would often shrink with horror. But as reason returned, and with its light a
                  dawning hope of an amended life, he blessed God, who had carried him through the
                  dark scene.</p>
               <p>Not at once could the proud heart be subdued,—not without a mighty struggle could
                  he, who had ruled thousands, become a humble, daily toiler. But Judge Morton, in
                  all his palmiest days, never knew happiness so pure as that with which, at each
                  day's close, he prayed a fervent "God bless you" upon the head of <emph>his
                     son.</emph>

               <p>AN exultant smile rested upon Mrs. Mark Atherton's face; it sat strangely there,
                  on those sallow features, whose habitual expression had become one of stolid
                  indifference to all about her. Since the first shock of Albert's terrible death
                  had passed away, she had maintained a stubborn silence concerning that event. Even
                  her husband could only <emph>imagine</emph> the dreadful scene to which his wife
                  had been a witness. All Nettie's tender, assiduous attentions could not draw a
                  smile, or word of endearment from the apathetic woman. Yet still, the sweet girl
                  wearied not in her efforts to bring back the sunshine to her mother's heart. The
                  room in which Mrs. Atherton sat bore marks of the tender thoughtfulness of her
                  young nurse. The perfume of fresh flowers, tastefully arranged in vases, filled
                  the apartment ment; a low, cheerful fire burned upon the hearth, before which,
                  near the lounge where her mother reclined, Nettie had drawn a light table, covered
                  with delicate, costly luxuries, and choicest books. Over all pervaded an air of
                  refinement and taste soothing to the invalid. Nettie's hand had smoothed the
                  silvery hair, and placed the snowy cap upon her mother's head,—had arranged the
                  rich folds of her cashmere wrapper, and then, with a gentle kiss, she had
                  playfully bade her "adieu for one little hour," to enjoy a ride with her father—a
                  recreation she much needed.</p>
               <p>After her daughter's departure, the mother seemed lost in thought; a
                  half-relenting look stole imperceptibly around her mouth; but at that moment the
                  postman's loud knock resounded through the house, and a servant entered with
                  letters and papers. Over the former Mrs. Atherton cast a hurried, indifferent
                  glance; but in an instant her whole expression changed. Hastily seizing two which
                  bore a familiar post-mark, she threw herself upon the lounge, and, without one
                  feeling of reproach or remorse, while yet that soft, innocent kiss warmed her
                  brow, she calmly possessed herself of their contents. Then, with a defiant,
                  scornful expression, she deliberately laid them upon the burning coals, and
                  watched till the last spark had fled. This it was which had called the almost
                  demoniacal smile to her face,—a smile in which hatred, malice and revenge mingled
                  in infernal brotherhood.</p>
               <p>"I'll foil them yet—the beggarly race," she exclaimed with clinched hands; "they
                  shall find that I<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7276-00000142"/> can both remember and
                  revenge an insult. Ha! ha! my young set-up pauper! little did you think whose eyes
                  would devour your honeyed words! But the post-office must be carefully watched.
                  Thank <emph>fortune,</emph> money can do that. A formal request for Nettie's hand,
                  forsooth!—I only wish her lover was here."</p>
               <p>Almost as in answer to her words, Mr. Selwyn was announced, and the welcome
                  visitor was greeted by Mrs. Atherton with an affectionate warmth quite unusual to
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Your coming is so opportune!" she exclaimed. "I was just wishing for your
                  presence."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said he; "is there any <emph>special</emph> reason for your desiring to see
                  me now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," she replied; "but first allow me to order refreshments for you."</p>
               <p>"Where is your little housekeeper and nurse?"</p>
               <p>"Nettie has gone to ride with her father," Mrs. Atherton replied; "she has seemed
                  quite drooping of late; she needs an entire change of scene and air, I think."</p>
               <p>"I do not doubt it," said Mr. Selwyn; "she is a sensitive little plant, and must
                  be nourished with care."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you understand her so well," Mrs. Atherton replied meaningly, as her
                  guest seated himself to her inviting repast.</p>
               <p>"To understand Nettie," said Mr. Selwyn, "is to know all that is pure and holy in
                  our natures; for she embodies all. By the way," he added, without noticing the
                  half sneer upon Mrs. Atherton's face, "that was quite a romantic affair about Mr.
                  Thornton's newly found son, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"More romantic than honorable," she replied.</p>
               <p>"How so? what do you mean?" he asked with surprise.</p>
               <p>"It may be romantic for a man to form disgraceful alliances in his youth; but I
                  call it neither honorable nor right for him to palm off upon his friends and the
                  public an illegitimate child, with the story of an early, secret marriage."</p>
               <p>Mr. Selwyn leaned back in perfect astonishment; he could not comprehend the
                  woman.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible," said he, "that you doubt the honor of such a man as Melville
                  Thornton? I thought it past all suspicion."</p>
               <p>"You do not know him as well as I," Mrs. Atherton replied; "human nature has its
                  weaknesses, you know."</p>
               <p>"And yours is, to despise everything and every body that has any goodness in
                  them," was Mr. Selwyn's thought that moment; but he merely replied,</p>
               <p>"No one can be more conscious of that than I; yet you surely do not believe the
                  intimation you made concerning Mr. Thornton."</p>
               <p>"Believe it! I <emph>know</emph> it. Judge Morton told me the story some time ago,
                  though he did not know the child was living. But I believe Mr. Thornton has known
                  it all the while, and his wife too; and that is the reason she took such a fancy
                  to the creature. They may deceive others by this 'sudden discovery,' but not me. I
                  say it is a shameful imposition."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7276-00000143"/>
               <p>"I am astonished and grieved to hear you say so," Mr. Selwyn answered mildly,
                  "both because of the respect I have for Mr. Thornton, and the affection your
                  daughter still retains for the young man, his son."</p>
               <p>"What do you know of that?" cried Mrs. Atherton, almost fiercely; "has the girl
                  dared to tell you so?"</p>
               <p>"It is not necessary to be told what one can so plainly see," Mr. Selwyn replied;
                  "but I beg you will spare Nettie your reproaches; she does not deserve them."</p>
               <p>"And you can speak calmly of such faithlessness, in your betrothed wife too?" Mrs.
                  Atherton exclaimed, half angrily.</p>
               <p>"Nettie and I have never been formally betrothed," said Mr. Selwyn, "though in
                  truth I may say I had looked to such an event with blissful anticipations. But
                  would you, her mother, have her wed where her heart goes not?"</p>
               <p>"If you wish to withdraw from your engagement with Nettie,—an engagement which,
                  but for the unfortunate occurrence in our family, I had supposed would be
                  consummated by marriage ere this, you can do so without drawing from me any
                     <emph>seeming</emph> assent," haughtily replied Mrs. Atherton.</p>
               <p>"Such was not my purpose, I assure you," said Mr. Selwyn. "Nettie and I have a
                  perfect understanding with each other; and she is a mirror of truth and
                  faithfulness."</p>
               <p>"What did you mean then by your question?"</p>
               <p>"Simply to ascertain your opinion of the attachment which exists between her and
                  Mr. Thornton's son."</p>
               <p>"You might have put it in a different form, then," said Mrs. Atherton, somewhat
                  mollified; "but I will tell you what I think, though in so doing I may speak
                  harshly of relatives. In early childhood, Nettie's aunt implanted false principles
                  in her breast, which I could never eradicate. She taught her to associate with the
                  low classes,—to make them her confidants; and, for reasons which I can now
                  understand, though I did not then, she cultivated an intimacy with that very
                  child, and almost forced Nettie into companionship with him. This she did,
                  contrary to my express commands, not only encouraging disobedience, but putting
                  foolish notions into the child's head. She has got over them now, though, I
                  think."</p>
               <p>"What you have said surprises me, Mrs. Atherton," quoth Mr. Selwyn, after a
                  moment's silence; "but allow me to ask you another question. Were Nettie free to
                  choose whom she would marry, and her choice should fall on the young man in
                  question, would you hesitate to sanction it, now that his position is
                  unexceptionable?"</p>
               <p>"I tell you she should never marry that fellow; no, never!" Mrs. Atherton brought
                  down her hand violently.</p>
               <p>"You do not say that to save my feelings?" he queried, wishing to draw her
                  out.</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, and judge for yourself," said she. "Years ago, in this very house,
                  Melville Thornton and his wife insulted me publicly,—yes, deliberately insulted<pb
                     n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7276-00000144"/> me in my own house; and from that
                  moment I hated them. I have waited patiently for the revenge which I then vowed.
                  Think you I would see my daughter wedded to their blood? No; that boy, in his
                  rags, was never so hateful to me as Melville Thornton's son. I have said to you
                  what never before escaped my lips," she added; "but I do not fear your
                  betrayal."</p>
               <p>"You need have no fear of that, madam," Mr. Selwyn replied; "but you will not
                  wonder that I am much shocked at the revelations you have made. It convinces me,
                  however, that young Thornton could have no hope of winning Nettie, even if I did
                  not stand in his way."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton's reply was prevented by the entrance of Nettie and her father, just
                  returned from their ride. The happy smile with which the beautiful girl greeted
                  Mr. Selwyn, might have deceived one even more watchful than her mother. Mrs.
                  Atherton cared not for the smile, except so far as it might please the rich,
                  aristocratic suitor; she cared not, though another's image than his dwelt in
                  Nettie's heart; her daughter's happiness entered not into the cold calculations of
                  the scheming, heartless mother.</p>
               <p>"There are your returns from the mail," Mrs. Atherton remarked to her husband,
                  pointing to a side-table.</p>
               <p>Nettie eagerly glanced over the letters; but she turned away with an expression of
                  disappointment that did not escape the notice of her mother and Mr. Selwyn. The
                  former saw it with secret triumph, the latter with solicitude.</p>
               <p>"What can it mean?" said the artless girl, as she was left alone with Mr. Selwyn
                  that evening; "since Lonny's first letter, telling me of his great and surprising
                  joy in discovering that Uncle Melville was his father, I have not heard a word,
                  though he said he should write again immediately, as soon as he returned from
                  Uncle Joseph's; and that Uncle Melville would write to my father, asking his
                  consent to our engagement."</p>
               <p>"That is all very easily explained," Mr. Selwyn replied; "Lonny is no doubt
                  detained longer at Daisyside than he expected, and Mr. Thornton is awaiting his
                  return before he writes. I wish you had no deeper cause for trouble, my dear
                  girl."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" Nettie asked, as she caught an implied meaning in his words.</p>
               <p>"Have you any expectation that your mother will consent to such an
                  engagement?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, certainly; why not? what objection can she have <emph>now?</emph> especially
                  when she comes to know that <emph>you</emph> decline marrying her daughter?"
                  Nettie added playfully.</p>
               <p>"You have not read her aright, dear Nettie; she will never consent."</p>
               <p>"Not consent! now that he is Uncle Melville's son?" exclaimed Nettie; "what makes
                  you think so, Mr. Selwyn?"</p>
               <p>"I may not betray her confidence, Nettie; but she has to-day told me that which
                  for ever shuts out all hope of her sanction to your union with Lonny"</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7276-00000145"/>
               <p>"Then, Mr. Selwyn," said Nettie, drawing herself up with decision, "I shall marry
                  without her sanction. Although she is my mother, I cannot always endure her
                  tyranny; the worm will turn at last, you know."</p>
               <p>Mr. Selwyn was astonished at this outburst from the ever gentle girl; but he
                  exclaimed approvingly:</p>
               <p>"That is right, Nettie; there are some cases, and this is one, where I hold that
                  parents have no power to decide for their children. But what says your
                  father?"</p>
               <p>"I have not burdened my father with my affairs," said Nettie; "he has enough
                  troubles of his own, poor man! but I hear his step on the stairs; now I will tell
                  him all."</p>
               <p>"Father," she called, opening the door, "has mother retired yet?"</p>
               <p>"She has, my child; she is unusually nervous and excited to-night; but I think the
                  anodyne I have given her will quiet her to sleep," Mr. Atherton replied.</p>
               <p>"Then will you come in here, father? I want to have a little talk with you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Atherton smiled as he entered the room. He imagined what the purport of the
                  "talk" might be. What was his surprise, therefore, when Nettie, laying her hand
                  affectionately in his, told him all her heart's history, and her voluntary
                  engagement with Lonny!</p>
               <p>"What is all this?" said he with a puzzled air, as she ceased; "I thought"—and he
                  looked significantly towards Mr. Selwyn.</p>
               <p>"You thought that I would marry your daughter without her consent," Mr. Selwyn
                  queried, half reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"No, not exactly that,—but—well, the truth is, I did not know what to think, since
                  you and Nettie have seemed so fond of each other. I had made up my mind to let
                  matters take their course."</p>
               <p>"You did wisely, sir," Mr. Selwyn replied; "your daughter, in making me the
                  confidant of what she has now told you, has secured my warmest friendship, and
                  saved both herself and me from much misery. I would still befriend her; and
                  therefore I join my entreaties to hers, that you will ratify a union so necessary
                  to her happiness. Mr. Thornton can now offer her a most unexceptionable and
                  honorable name."</p>
               <p>"As to that," said Mr. Atherton, "it will make no difference to me; I
                     <emph>always</emph> liked the young man, and determined Nettie should marry
                  him, if she wished."</p>
               <p>"Then you will consent, even if mother does not?" Nettie asked with a bright
                  smile.</p>
               <p>"I do not know what your mother has said,"—and Mr. Atherton sighed,—"neither do I
                  think it best for us to speak of that subject; but this <emph>I</emph> will say:
                  you shall be happy, my daughter, if it lies within your father's power to make you
                  so. This shall be my reply to Mr. Thornton's request, when it comes."</p>
               <p>"When it comes! Ah!" thought Nettie, as day after day passed, and no word from the
                  loved one,—"well might father say that! Can it be that in his prosperity he
                     <emph>forgets?</emph> No; I'll not believe that;—any thing but that."</p>

               <p>IT had become necessary, quite, in this crisis of affairs, that Mr. Ashton should
                  seek an interview with Miss Mowbray. For was it not by her request that Mr.
                  Thornton wrote to him on behalf of Richard Morton? and did not her large
                  remittances have to pass, by some pretext or other, through his hands into
                  Richard's purse? Now, therefore, that morton domestic troubles threatened to
                  destroy their business relations, it became his imperative duty to inform her of
                  the state of things, and consult her wishes as to her secret benefactions for the
                  future. It <emph>might</emph> be necessary to do all this—but was it necessary
                  that the consultation should be lengthened into days, and then weeks,—business
                  neglected—friends forgotten—all for young Morton's benefit? It was very evident
                  from the mischievous glance of her hazel eyes, and the merry shake of her brown
                  curls, that <emph>one,</emph> at least, at Woodbine Lodge, thought far
                  otherwise.</p>
               <p>"It is of no use for you to try to conceal it, Maggie," said she, stepping softly
                  into her friend's chamber one night, and surprising her in tears; "you are happy,
                  and yet miserable, and it's because you love Mr. Ashton. Now make me your
                  confessor, and say, is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lucille," cried she, passionately, "would that I had never seen him, or
                  rather, that he had never seen me, in such false colors."</p>
               <p>"There! now see what my selfishness has done," exclaimed Lucille, stamping her
                  feet with vexation, "I have destroyed your happiness, just to secure my own."</p>
               <p>"Oh no—no!" cried Maggie, wiping her eyes, and attempting to smile; "it is my own
                  folly that causes these tears."</p>
               <p>"Why your folly, Maggie?"</p>
               <p>"That I should have so far forgotten my true position, as to think of him at all,"
                  was the blushing reply.</p>
               <p>"Your true position is honorable, dear Maggie; as honorable as mine, and I should
                  wish for no person's favor that did not think so," Lucille proudly answered.</p>
               <p>"But the <emph>deception,</emph> Lucille;—how he will despise me for that!"</p>
               <p>"What! when he—by whom you mean Mr. Ashton, I presume"—Lucille added
                  mischievously—"when <emph>he</emph> knows that it was through your devotion to
                  me—through the kindness of your heart that could not say<pb n="284-285"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000147"/> nay to my caprices? then he is not worthy of your
                  love, dear Maggie."</p>
               <p>"But he must never know that; you must not be betrayed, through me," said Maggie
                  resolutely.</p>
               <p>"He <emph>shall</emph> know that," was Lucille's decided response, "and that too,"
                  she mentally added, "before I sleep this night."</p>
               <p>"Now, dear Lucille, I beg—I entreat"—Maggie began.</p>
               <p>"Beg and entreat nothing to-night," playfully interrupted Lucille, sealing her
                  lips with a good-night kiss; "go to sleep now, and in the morning we can talk more
                  rationally."</p>
               <p>"Promise me, then, that you will see me first of all."</p>
               <p>"In the morning? yes, that I will; so now to sleep and happy dreams. Good
                  night."</p>
               <p>Outside the door, Lucille's whole manner changed; her face alternately paled and
                  flushed, her lips trembled with excessive agitation, and an expression of fear
                  escaped her lips. But she was not one to yield when once she had resolved; so,
                  with timid but firm steps she descended the stairs and entered the drawing-room
                  where Mr. Ashton still lingered over his book.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Miss Singleton," he exclaimed, laying aside the volume which, had she but
                  glanced over his shoulder, she would have seen was <emph>upside down!</emph> "I
                  thought you ladies had retired."</p>
               <p>"We had, sir," she replied, "but I have returned that I may have an uninterrupted
                  conversation with you, if you are not particularly occupied."</p>
               <p>"I was merely whiling away the time," said he, pointing to the book, "till I
                  should feel some inclination to sleep. I am very happy of your company."</p>
               <p>"What I have to say to you, Mr. Ashton," she began in a clear, sweet voice, "will
                  doubtless astonish you greatly. May I first beg the assurance that the secret I
                  shall confide to you will be sacredly preserved?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Miss Singleton, you can depend on my secrecy; I think you have had
                  some evidence of that," he replied, not doubting she referred in some way to
                  Richard Morton.</p>
               <p>"That is sufficient," said she; "I think I can trust you. Now, before I proceed,
                  will you allow me to ask you a few plain questions, such perhaps as you might
                  think very presuming in me?"</p>
               <p>"I can think of no questions that I should be unwilling to answer you; proceed, if
                  you please." Mr. Ashton was becoming quite curious.</p>
               <p>"Do you love my friend, Miss Mowbray?" The young girl bent her full gaze upon
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Well—really, Miss Singleton,"—the confused lawyer stammered.</p>
               <p>"I do not ask you out of mere idle curiosity," said she, amused at his
                  embarrassment, "nor because I wish to win a lover for one who has already more
                  than she can dispose of; but it is necessary I should know, if possible, before I
                  make you my confidant."</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7276-00000148"/>
               <p>Mr. Ashton looked at the young, beautiful girl with surprise; "I cannot imagine,"
                  said he, "what connection my sentiments towards Miss Mowbray can have with what
                  you are about to say; but I will answer your question honestly—<emph>I do not
                     know.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Not know whether you love her!" she exclaimed with astonishment, not unmingled
                  with displeasure.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I can better tell you, if you will first explain to me what love is,"
                  said Mr. Ashton, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Ah! now you are quizzing me!"</p>
               <p>"No, I assure you I am not; I never believed there was such a thing, till"—he
                  hesitated—</p>
               <p>"Till when?" she asked archly.</p>
               <p>"Till lately," he replied, coloring.</p>
               <p>"My question is answered," said she, with a merry laugh; "now let me ask another;
                  were she to lose her position,—to become a humble individual like myself, would it
                  alter your sentiments towards her?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot divine your object in questioning me thus," said Mr. Ashton, "but I am
                  persuaded it is no unkind one, and therefore I will speak frankly. If to live in
                  the presence of one, as in some higher, purer atmosphere—to feel no joy save in
                  that presence, be love, then do I love Miss Mowbray. But her position is one that
                  I would never seek to change. Were it humble as you say your own is, a blissful
                  dream might be mine."</p>
               <p>"Then my selfish folly may yet be forgiven," Lucille exclaimed with glistening
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Miss Singleton? you are a perfect enigma to-night."</p>
               <p>"Listen, and I will tell you what I mean," said she, while a beautiful glow
                  overspread her cheek. "She whom you love is even more worthy than you dream; for
                  with pure unselfishness, she has not hesitated to sacrifice her own happiness for
                  her capricious friend. When I tell you that, at my earnest entreaty, she assumed a
                  character distasteful to her, simply that <emph>I</emph> might be benefited; that
                  she still retains the same self-denying position for my sake, turning a deaf ear
                  to all her own heart-pleadings; and that that position is one you have just said
                     <emph>you</emph> would not seek to change; you will not wonder that I revere
                  her; or that I could not forbear making this revelation to you. Brought up in
                  luxury, surrounded by friends who knew the exact <emph>value of my fortune,</emph>
                  I sickened of the adulation paid the heiress of Mowbray Hall. Coming among
                  strangers, I was seized with an irresistible desire to be known and valued without
                  the powerful auxiliary of gold; so I persuaded Maggie, my ever faithful friend and
                  foster-sister, to aid me, by exchanging positions."</p>
               <p>"Stay," cried Mr. Ashton, interrupting her, "do I understand you aright? are
                     <emph>you</emph> the heiress?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," she replied, smiling; "I am Lucille Mowbray."</p>
               <p>"And she?" pointing up—</p>
               <p>"Is Margaret Singleton,—more worthy than if the world could not contain her
                  possessions."</p>
               <p>"Aye, and a thousand times more dear to me,"<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000149"/> Mr. Ashton added, betrayed by his surprise into
                  this confession.</p>
               <p>"You will understand now, why I thought it right to make you a confidant of our
                  secret," said Lucille, with an approving smile; "Maggie would never consent, so I
                  have taken the responsibility myself."</p>
               <p>"You have done right, and nobly too," said he: "to my latest day I shall bless you
                  for this hour; but Miss Mow——"</p>
               <p>"Call me Singleton still," Lucille playfully interrupted; "remember, you are
                  pledged to secrecy."</p>
               <p>"Miss Singleton then, though it will sit awkwardly on my tongue now. Richard
                  Morton surely has known this?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; and I would not have him upon any account."</p>
               <p>"And he striving and plodding away, to be able to claim your hand!" Mr. Ashton
                  spoke rather reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"He will not strive or plod much longer," Lucille replied with a bright smile.
                  "Mowbray Hall will need his oversight soon. But good night, Mr. Ashton," she
                  added, looking at her watch, "our conference has lasted late."</p>
               <p>"Heaven bless you, as I do, for it," he exclaimed, opening the door for her; "you
                  have taught me a new lesson to-night."</p>
               <p>A fresh page of the human heart had been laid before Mr. Ashton in the last hour.
                  To see that young girl, beautiful, gifted and wealthy, cast aside all outward ward
                  distinctions, that the world's friendship might be duly estimated, was indeed a
                  "new lesson" for him,—one not soon to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>"I was never before so fully impressed with the folly of judging ourselves or
                  others by the world's favor," said he the next morning, after a long and
                  particularly interesting conversation, in which a third party would have found
                  themselves <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de trop.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"No one can realize that more than I," his companion answered with a smile,
                  "especially since, in my borrowed greatness, this same world has discovered
                  virtues of which I could never boast."</p>
               <p>"If no greater mistake had been made than in your case," he added, bowing, "the
                  principle might be questioned; but look at your beautiful young friend, with a
                  mind rich in culture, a heart whose purity is mirrored in her lovely face;—a
                  haughty, supercilious stare from those infinitely beneath her, is all the
                  recognition she often receives; while, if her <emph>wealth</emph> were but known,
                  how would those same persons flock around her, with sickening, lavish praises! How
                  would her 'auburn curls' be immortalized in verse,—sonnets innumerable dedicated
                  to her 'soft, languishing eyes,' and her really exquisite style of dress become
                  the reigning mode!"</p>
               <p>"You are a genuine artist," replied the lady, laughing heartily; "for you have
                  drawn a life-picture, and I have been the sitter! only, in place of the 'auburn
                  tresses,' my enamored swains have poetized the 'glossy, raven braids,'—have gone
                  into raptures about 'the glance of that dark, flashing eye.' I cannot express
                     to<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7276-00000150"/> you the deep loathing I have
                  towards these mammon-worshippers. Thank God, there are some who 'detest
                  heiresses,'" she added archly.</p>
               <p>"Come, come," Mr. Ashton laughingly rejoined, "do not bring up my light words in
                  judgment against me; it was the <emph>principle</emph> we have been speaking of
                  that I detested, not certainly such an illustration as I have found here."</p>
               <p>"Well turned, sir; your words are pardoned," said she, drawing up with mock
                  dignity.</p>
               <p>"Now, for the settlement of one question," he added earnestly; "and Lewis Ashton's
                  happiness is no longer a matter of doubt or uncertainty."</p>
               <p>"I must first consult Lucille," replied his companion, blushing.</p>
               <p>"What! so soon as that! why, Thanksgiving comes in two months more," cried
                  Lucille, with well affected surprise; "what impatient beings lovers are! Well, Mr.
                  Ashton, if you expect to win my consent, you must promise me first, that, instead
                  of losing this dear friend, I shall, by the arrangement, gain your excellent
                  company at Mowbray Hall for the winter."</p>
               <p>"At Mowbray Hall!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and you must furthermore promise to enter my service at once, and assist me
                  in some plans which this foolish little head is projecting."</p>
               <p>"I accept the conditions," said he, grasping her hand warmly.</p>

               <p>A HAPPY group gathered around the cheerful hearth at Willow Glen. It had been a
                  busy day, as were many preceding ones; for the "fatted calf" had been killed, and
                  neighbors and friends bidden to a joyous feast on the morrow;—"For this my son was
                  lost and is found,—therefore will I bless <emph>His</emph> glorious name who hath
                  brought such joy to my soul." Such was the language and spirit with which Melville
                  Thornton gloried over his new-found treasure.</p>
               <p>This was indeed a labor of love to Charlotte Thornton's benevolent heart; for in
                  their rejoicings they had not forgotten the poor and needy. Whose feet trod on
                  soft-carpeted floors, or whose robes were of finest texture, entered not their
                  thoughts, as from house to house their glad summons went forth, bidding
                     <emph>all</emph> come and join in their thank-offering.</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7276-00000151"/>
               <p>Now, at night-fall, when all things were ready for the feast, they gathered, a
                  happy family group, around their fireside. Uncle Joseph was there, with his
                  genial, heart-warming face;—the loving, motherly Henrietta;—"Aunt Lottie,"
                  reflecting her own serene and joyful spirit;—Melville Thornton, with heart attuned
                  to praise; and Lonny, almost trembling for the <emph>reality</emph> of his
                  bliss;—all whom their hearts craved were there, save two; and they,—but we will
                  not anticipate.</p>
               <p>"It is strange what keeps Mark," said Uncle Joseph, breaking the pleasant, dreamy
                  silence into which they had fallen.</p>
               <p>"I was just thinking of him, and Nettie too," added Mr. Thornton; "I cannot give
                  up the hope of seeing them yet."</p>
               <p>"Nor I," said Aunt Lottie; "and yet it does seem strange that they neither come
                  nor write."</p>
               <p>"Nettie has answered but one of my letters," remarked Lonny.</p>
               <p>"And Mark none of mine, though I have repeatedly written," added Mr. Thornton.</p>
               <p>"I guess there's trouble in the camp again," said Uncle Joseph, laughing; "perhaps
                  his sweet-tempered wife has shut them <emph>both</emph> up this time."</p>
               <p>"Mark knows how anxious we are to have <emph>both</emph> of our children to the
                  feast to-morrow:"—Aunt Lottie cast a loving glance upon Lonny as she said
                  this.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and he is not one to submit to his wife's dictation in such a case," Mr.
                  Thornton replied; "so I still think they will be here, and make their own
                  explanation."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm sure I hope they will, for Lonny's sake," Henrietta Atherton earnestly
                  added; for she had seen the "little cloud, no bigger than a man's hand," just
                  beginning to cast its shadow upon her loved child.</p>
               <p>A glorious October sun gilded the sky, making more resplendent the gorgeous livery
                  of the autumn-dyed trees; the green willows waved and nodded a respectful
                  salutation to his golden majesty; the little stream which gurgled its way through
                  the meadow, leaped joyously forth at the new dawning light; all nature sprang into
                  life, and, donning its gay, holiday attire, poured forth a morning chorus of
                  worship to its Creator and Beautifier. Willow Glen, bathed in this glowing sea of
                  light, awoke from its sleep of innocence and peace; away on the bright wings of
                  the morning flew its nightly guardians, while on each shining ray, as in golden
                  chariots, myriads of unbidden guests descended to this, their loved haunt; around,
                  on every side, their unseen hands scattered fragrant offerings; into its open
                  portals they glided—these ministering spirits—these angel-watchers around God's
                  chosen ones.</p>
               <p>With the earliest dawn, Charlotte Thornton softly stole to the bedside of her
                  child—hers doubly now, and, bending low over his unconscious face, breathed a
                  mother's blessing there—a blessing caught up in gentle strains, till in heaven's
                  high arches, loud and sweet, the notes resounded. Then, with light footsteps,
                     she<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7276-00000152"/> descended to her grateful task,
                  leaving those warm breathings, like a halo of brightness, encircling the sleeper's
                  head.</p>
               <p>Out upon the green lawn,—for the air was soft and balmy,—beneath the
                  wide-spreading trees, whose branches formed a vaulted roof above them,—they spread
                  the hospitable board. In Nature's temple, with her living baptism, would the
                  father consecrate his gift. Lonny stood proudly at that father's side. With joy he
                  claimed his noble birthright; with gratitude unutterable he laid down his burden.
                  But more than joy, pride, or gratitude mingled in his deep, reverential love for
                  those whose hearts had adopted him in his isolation. Stronger even than by the
                  ties of blood was he bound to them,—the saviors of his youth and manhood. Melville
                  Thornton had gained a son; the desire of Lonny's heart had been granted; but their
                  gain had not been Joseph Atherton's loss.</p>
               <p>But, while we are thus digressing, the happy villagers have gathered in merry
                  groups over the beautiful grounds. Here and there a rustling silk retreats
                  disdainfully from its humble neighbor; now and then a sidelong glance, a
                  contemptuous shrug, or low, scornful exclamation, betrays an uncongenial presence
                  there. But not long can pride or haughtiness linger in such an atmosphere;—love,
                  all-glowing love has spread the thankful feast; and to its sweet influence they
                  must yield, or coldly turn away.</p>
               <p>"Look around," said Melville Thornton to Mr. Flint, who sat at his right hand;
                  "look around this table, and tell me whose is the happiest heart here to-day."</p>
               <p>"That would be a difficult task," Mr. Flint replied; "if the face is an index of
                  the heart, I should say they were equally so; for all seem full of smiles."</p>
               <p>"And yet," resumed Mr. Thornton, "in each of these hearts lies some hidden sorrow.
                  What a glorious profession is yours, sir, that can reach these sorrows with a
                  healing balm."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but my profession has its trials, as well as others," sighed Mr. Flint.</p>
               <p>"I do not doubt it; but do not its joys more than counterbalance the trials?"</p>
               <p>"Sometimes; but it is a very laborious life," Mr. Flint replied.</p>
               <p>"That isn't the way <emph>my</emph> minister talks," said Uncle Joseph, who had
                  been silently listening; "Mr. Goodman says he wouldn't exchange situations with
                  the richest man on earth."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," rejoined Mr. Flint; "for our reward pertaineth not to earth."</p>
               <p>"Humph! where then?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Flint shrugged his shoulders; he knew his tormentor was near;—"Ah, Miss Page,
                  are you here?" said he; "this is a most delightful occasion, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is a happy one, and those who made it deserve to be happy too," she
                  replied with a grateful glance at Mr. Thornton;—"but, Mr. Flint, don't you think
                  it would have been better to send the money to that great—what d'ye call it
                  society, than to spend it<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7276-00000153"/> in feeding
                  these poor critters? it may encourage idleness, you know," she added with a
                  knowing wink.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Thornton's property is at his own disposal," replied Mr. Flint, reprovingly;
                  "for my part, I think he is celebrating his son's return in a most befitting
                  manner."</p>
               <p>"My wife would scarcely agree with the first part of your remark," said Mr.
                  Thornton; "indeed, I suspect she is at this moment giving it a
                     <emph>practical</emph> refutation," he added, pointing smilingly to a group
                  from whom Charlotte Thornton had just turned, and whose happy faces, as they
                  looked significantly into each other's hands, showed that something very welcome
                  had found its way thither.</p>
               <p>"That's what I call preaching a reg'lar sermon," said Miss Priscilla; "such a one
                  as poor folks can understand. What do you say, Mr. Flint?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Thornton is very benevolent, certainly," he replied; "I only hope those poor
                  people will not take advantage of her kindness."</p>
               <p>"Take advantage of it!" exclaimed Miss Priscilla, "yes, they will; they'll take
                  the advantage of having better homes, better clothes, "and better hearts too."</p>
               <p>"Bravo!" cried Uncle Joseph; "those always follow in Lottie's steps, don't they,
                  Lonny?"</p>
               <p>"I can most emphatically testify to the first two," Lonny replied with feeling;
                  "and, as to the third, the heart must be sadly depraved that could resist her
                  gentle influence."</p>
               <p>"I always like to hear a son speak well of his mother," said Mr. Flint,
                  approvingly.</p>
               <p>"My heart blessed her, sir, ere I could claim such dear relationship," Lonny
                  replied; "she has been even more than a mother to me."</p>
               <p>"And Richard Morton has been more than a brother," added a low voice behind
                  him.</p>
               <p>"You say truly, sir," he replied, turning to Mr. Ashton, just as that gentleman,
                  with Richard and the young ladies approached; "I, who in my childhood could lay
                  claim to no kith or kin—no friend on earth—can to-day proudly clasp the hand of a
                  noble brother,—one in spirit if not in name,—can point with honor to friends, such
                  as the world boasts but few; above all, I can stand here in the glory and pride of
                  a father's untarnished name, and claim as my mother one whose goodness and purity
                  of heart scarce pertain to mortals."</p>
               <p>"Enthusiastic!" said Mr. Ashton in a low voice to the ladies; "but if rumor be
                  true, none too much so."</p>
               <p>"Not one whit," Miss Mowbray replied with animation; "Mrs. Thornton's equal cannot
                  be found—unless"—she hesitated, glancing at her friend.</p>
               <p>"Make no exceptions in my favor if you please," laughingly rejoined the other;
                  "Mrs. Thornton is without a compeer."</p>
               <p>Richard Morton could not interpret the meaning look with which Mr. Ashton regarded
                  her, as he replied,—"there are some deeds which outshine even hers,"—or the
                  trembling of the arm which rested within his.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7276-00000154"/>
               <p>Without apparently noticing them, he said, turning to Miss Mowbray,—"Why is not
                  Nettie Atherton here? she ought surely to share in the congratulations today."</p>
               <p>"I have been asking myself the same question," Miss Mowbray replied; "let us refer
                  to Mr. Thornton for an explanation."</p>
               <p>"He is as much at a loss to account for it as yourself," said Mr. Thornton's
                  pleasant voice, coming up at that moment; "it is the only alloy in our happiness
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>"You apprised her, of course?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly; Lonny would have gone for her in person, but I prevented it; I
                  wished her parents to accompany her."</p>
               <p>"What <emph>can</emph> be their reason for not doing so?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know; I cannot imagine;"—Mr. Thornton's brow grew troubled.</p>
               <p>"Your letter may not have reached them."</p>
               <p>"Letter! we have written three or four at least."</p>
               <p>"And no reply?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"Then it is really inexplicable,—and Nettie so fond of him too?"</p>
               <p>"Nettie is not in fault, I am persuaded; but come," Mr. Thornton added, clearing
                  his brow; "we must not darken a day like this by any imaginary clouds. Will you go
                  with me while I introduce to you some new faces—such as you will not be likely to
                  see at Woodbine Lodge?"</p>
               <p>"Look around," he continued, pausing in their walk down the green lawn, to listen
                  to the hum of happy voices, bursting forth here and there into joyful merriment;
                  "ought not we who have been intrusted with the means of producing so much
                  enjoyment, to be doubly grateful—doubly faithful?"</p>
               <p>A painful flush crossed Miss Mowbray's brow as she replied,—"Yes, surely, wealth
                  was never bestowed for naught."</p>
               <p>"Your life as well as your lips testify to that," said he, bowing; "now let us
                  mingle with some whom I would commend especially to your charities."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you would consent to be my almoner," she replied, as they continued their
                  walk; "we shall leave so shortly, it will scarce repay the trouble of forming new
                  acquaintances."</p>
               <p>"Leave so shortly! what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"That we shall spend the winter at Mowbray Hall."</p>
               <p>"Are you in earnest?" he exclaimed with surprise; "I thought—I hoped the
                  attractions here were becoming so <emph>increasingly</emph> great, that we should
                  retain you permanently,"—Mr. Thornton's eye glanced meaningly towards Mr. Ashton
                  as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Even then we must return thither for a time," she replied with a blush.</p>
               <p>"But you will at least promise that it shall be only for a time,—that Woodbine
                  Lodge shall not long be deserted."</p>
               <p>"We cannot promise any thing with certainty now; but I assure you, Mr. Thornton,
                  both my friend and<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7276-00000155"/> myself look upon our
                  residence here as the happiest part of our lives."</p>
               <p>"She goes with you, of course?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; we have never been separated since we were children."</p>
               <p>"What will Richard Morton do?"</p>
               <p>"I trust he will do as she wishes—go with us."</p>
               <p>"What! will they marry so soon? I thought he had resolved to devote himself to the
                  retrieval of his father's misfortunes."</p>
               <p>"So he has, but that may not be the herculean task he anticipates."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Miss Mowbray, I understand you; you would do a noble deed. But are you aware
                  of the extent of Judge Morton's indebtedness?"</p>
               <p>"Richard has told us," she replied, the troubled look returning to her face; "but,
                  indeed, Mr. Thornton, your commendations are unworthily bestowed,—they pain me,
                  because I do not deserve them."</p>
               <p>"Pardon my intrusion, sir," said a gentleman coming up at that moment, "but the
                  company are waiting your response to a sentiment just offered."</p>
               <p>"A sentiment! what is it, Mr. Colton?"</p>
               <p>"In honor of yourself and the day, sir; see with what eager expectation they are
                  gathering to hear you."</p>
               <p>"I was unprepared for this," said Mr. Thornton, stepping into the midst of his
                  guests, as his name was loudly called, "but wait one moment," he added, as he
                  retreated towards the house, "and I will present you a sentiment worthy the
                  occasion."</p>
               <p>"A MOTHER'S LEGACY!" said he, holding before them the shining gift; "what more
                  appropriate offering could I bring you to-day than this? <emph>A mother's
                     legacy!</emph>—around this dwelling it has cast its golden halo; within its
                  walls it has brought such riches as the world dreams not of—to me the incomparable
                  wife, the noble son."</p>
               <p>A low, sighing murmur, echoing through the tinted foliage above, alone broke the
                  stillness in which his words ceased. Softly a bright sunbeam stole towards the
                  sacred relic, still suspended in his hands, till its radiant light glowed with
                  living fire those words of immortal worth. Entranced they gazed, as though some
                  new inspiration had broken upon them,—then with one loud, long applause, went up
                  the heart's response to the glorious "legacy."</p>

               <p>INTO a plain, but comfortably furnished apartment, we would glance for a moment,
                  as a familiar face greets our sight. The surroundings are not those of his former
                  affluent home; the carpet is of coarser texture than even his servants used; the
                  wooden chairs, pine table, unvarnished uncurtained bed, such as he had seen among
                  his poor tenants, but never dreamed of inheriting himself. Yet there is a light
                  upon Judge Morton's face—a glow in his eye, which speaks more joy than gilded
                  homes or princely revenues could bring. He is pale, for the seeds of disease took
                  deep root during his prison life, and are now spreading their blight through his
                  frame; but still he labors on with firm and steady purpose; he will not falter for
                  bodily weakness, while his son is sacrificing life and happiness for him. Three
                  rooms comprise their whole establishment; for though the firm of "Morton and Son"
                  fast gains in public favor and patronage, every cent which is not demanded by
                  their necessities, is scrupulously applied to one object—a long, and seemingly
                  hopeless task! but Richard will not suffer himself to look despondingly into the
                  future, while obeying the noble promptings of duty and affection.</p>
               <p>Yet it must be confessed, something very like a sigh escaped him, as he entered
                  his humble home, on his return from Woodbine Lodge and the festivities at Willow
                  Glen. So strikingly did the contrast between the happiness he had left and the
                  duties which awaited him here, force itself upon him, that for a moment, his heart
                  sank within him; but it was only for a moment,—his father's glad welcome, so
                  different from the cold tones of former years, restored the cheerful smile to his
                  face, and peace to his heart.</p>
               <p>"Back again, according to promise," exclaimed the judge delightedly; "I feared you
                  would be tempted to stay longer than you said, Richard."</p>
               <p>"No, father; business is the end and aim of my life now; where is mother?"</p>
               <p>"She is lying down in your room. Richard, this life is killing her."</p>
               <p>"And you too, father," said the young man sadly, as he gazed into his pale face;
                  "would that I were able to save you both from such trials."</p>
               <p>"Who has prevented you from being able?" replied his father with emotion;
                     "<emph>I,</emph> Richard,—I who<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7276-00000157"/>
                  should have gloried in you,—who should have acknowledged the goodness I could not
                  imitate,—who should—"</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, father; do not reproach yourself. What sacrifice can be too great to
                  purchase the inward joy you now possess?"</p>
               <p>"But I had no right to sacrifice you,—to destroy all your earthly hopes."</p>
               <p>"They are not destroyed, father;"—a soft smile played over Richard's face as he
                  spoke,—"Maggie will be mine yet."</p>
               <p>"But not for years to come,—not till you have slaved yourself to death to save
                  your father's honor."</p>
               <p>"Not quite to <emph>death,</emph> father; her prophecy is still too fresh in my
                  mind to allow such a supposition."</p>
               <p>"Her prophecy! what was that?"</p>
               <p>"That 'ere a twelvemonth's sun shall wane, a happy home, a loving bride, a
                  father's free and honored name, a fortune such as miser's crave,' shall all be
                  mine," said Richard, laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Poor girl! how little she knows about such things!" his father replied with a sad
                  smile; "fortunes are not made in one year, especially if there be a wasted one to
                  restore."</p>
               <p>"I hope you do not think I received her words literally," said Richard; "yet there
                  is comfort in the <emph>spirit</emph> of them."</p>
               <p>"So there is, and I should like to tell her so for your sake."</p>
               <p>"Would you, father? would you really like to see Maggie?" Richard eagerly
                  cried.</p>
               <p>"Better, perhaps, than she would like to see me," said the judge, with feeling;
                  "she can never forget the injustice I have done her and you, my son."</p>
               <p>"Do not speak of that now, father; Maggie longs to see and comfort you. I will
                  write to her this very night, if you consent."</p>
               <p>"What! in this place?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, here; believe me, sir, this home would seem a palace with your blessing on
                  our plighted love."</p>
               <p>"Is it so, my son? do you thus crave a blessing from the father who has so deeply
                  injured you? Then it shall be so. She shall see me in my humiliation; she, whom I
                  in my pride despised, shall see me penitent before her."</p>
               <p>"You mistake Maggie—you mistake me, father. These are not your days of
                  humiliation; they are the proudest of your life."</p>
               <p>"Why, Richard! when did you come?" Mrs. Morton languidly exclaimed, entering the
                  room just then.</p>
               <p>"About an hour since; you were taking your rest, and so I would not disturb you.
                  Are you ill, mother?"</p>
               <p>"No more than usual," she sighed; "but tell me about your visit; I like to hear
                  something of the world we <emph>used</emph> to live in."</p>
               <p>"And the world you sigh for now," added Richard sadly.</p>
               <p>"You cannot blame me for that," said she; "I was very happy till you left us, and
                  our misfortunes came."</p>
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7276-00000158"/>
               <p>Richard might have retorted with truth, that the latter affected her far more
                  strongly than his absence; but his was the office of comforter. Taking her hand
                  with respectful tenderness, he said soothingly, "I know what you must have
                  suffered—what you are still suffering; I would that I had the power of restoring
                  you to affluence; but above all, dear mother, do I long to see you seeking your
                  happiness from a source that can never fail you."</p>
               <p>"You saw Miss Mowbray, of course?" said Mrs. Morton, after a moment's silence.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and both she and Miss Singleton sent many affectionate remembrances to you.
                  I have a little parcel in my valise, containing presents, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Humph! she considers us objects of charity, no doubt."</p>
               <p>"This does not look like it, certainly," said Richard, unrolling the parcel, and
                  displaying from thence a tiny watch of exquisite workmanship, with its rich
                  appendages; "this is a gift fit for any lady in the land."</p>
               <p>"Why did you suffer her to send me such a present?" Mrs. Morton asked, half-vexed,
                  half-delighted.</p>
               <p>"I assure you, mother, I did not know the contents of the bundle; she gave it to
                  me just as I was leaving."</p>
               <p>"I cannot accept it; and if I did, of what use would it be to me here?" said Mrs.
                  Morton, unfolding the little note which accompanied it.</p>
               <p>"Read it aloud," said the judge.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray begs the acceptance of her gift, and only awaits Mrs. Morton's
                  pleasure, to assure her in person of the undiminished friendship and esteem of her
                  former guest."</p>
               <p>"A pretty place this would be to receive her!" Mrs. Morton exclaimed, looking
                  around as she concluded.</p>
               <p>"I do not see how you can do otherwise without being rude," her husband
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"Do otherwise!" she repeated; "do you suppose I will consent to have her look upon
                  our degradation? This very gift shows that she does not know the extent of
                  it."</p>
               <p>"No, she does not know of degradation," exclaimed Richard; "for there is none
                  here; but she does know how nobly you are struggling with adverse tides, and she
                  honors you for it,—honors you more than when you were surrounded with luxury and
                  friends."</p>
               <p>"I cannot see her; return this gift, and tell her so, Richard."</p>
               <p>"No, mother; for my sake, I entreat you to receive her here, and with her, one who
                  asks a parent's blessing from you. Three months hence they will return to England.
                  Father—mother! can you refuse my only request—that, you bless your children ere we
                  part!"</p>
               <p>"Going away did you say!—Miss Singleton going!" exclaimed the judge, wiping his
                  eye.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Maggie returns with Miss Mowbray to her father's halls: I have no home to
                  offer her now, you know."</p>
               <p>"No home, because your father's folly and madness<pb n="308-309"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000159"/> drove you from it. Richard, why do you not curse
                  me? Why ask a blessing upon hopes that I have cruelly blasted!"—Judge Morton's
                  whole frame shook with emotion as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Father," said Richard, with a calm voice but quivering lip,—"could I recall the
                  past six months, and be placed where I then was, with the choice before me, to see
                  you moving on as in your prosperous days, or by the sacrifice of my heart's
                  dearest hopes to bring to your soul the light that now dwells there, think you I
                  would hesitate one moment? No, father; 'tis Heaven's own work; it will bring its
                  recompense at last."</p>
               <p>"And this is the son that we despised!" almost groaned the judge. "Wife, tell him,
                  as I do, that for his heart's choice our warmest blessing waits. Bring her to us,
                  my son."</p>
               <p>It was the same apartment—the same coarse, dull-hued carpet—the plain, rude
                  furniture that told of struggling poverty;—and yet the soft gleam which the
                  cheerful fire threw across the room in that twilight, disclosed a group of happy
                  faces, which many a wealthy fireside might envy. Love's magic wand had transformed
                  the dull abode—the cheerless home, into almost paradisiacal beauty;—love, which
                  crept softly from the maiden's dark eye to the father's heart,—which crushed out
                  pride and awoke a latent tenderness in the mother's breast,—such love did Richard
                  Morton's betrothed bring to his humble home. She came with a
                     gentle,<emph>hopeful</emph> smile, that sent gladness into their hearts—they
                  knew not why. She beautified with her presence the lowly dwelling, till even Mrs.
                  Morton wondered it had ever seemed cheerless to her;—with her own fair hands she
                  shared the labors they would have concealed from her.</p>
               <p>No thoughts of "humiliation" or "degradation" entered the little circle around
                  that twilight hearth. Judge Morton could not have received more deferential
                  attention,—his wife more grateful homage, had he lounged on richest damask,
                  instead of that bare, uncushioned chair; or her plain, simple garments been
                  exchanged for jewelled robes. Guests too were there, to whom <emph>the
                     world</emph> bowed low; but here no fellowship with that false world was found.
                  New thoughts, new views, new feelings, filled Judge Morton's mind, as he sat,
                  silently contemplating the scene. Suddenly a soft hand was laid upon his arm;—"You
                  are sad to-night, sir," said a sweet voice beside him.</p>
               <p>"Not sad, Maggie," he tenderly replied; "but full of wonder, joy, and
                  gratitude;"—then, rousing himself, he clasped her hand, exclaiming
                     earnestly,—"<emph>Must</emph> you leave us to-morrow? can you not remain a
                  little longer?"</p>
               <p>It was well her face was but imperfectly revealed in that glimmering fire-light;
                  else the bright smile which illumined it, and the play of joy around her mouth,
                  might have told a tale at variance with her words.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, it is impossible, sir," said she; "Miss Mowbray needs my services more
                  than ever now."</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7276-00000160"/>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray surely would not refuse a request in which we all so heartily join,"
                  Mrs. Morton said, with an air of earnestness which showed her sincerity.</p>
               <p>Tears trembled in the maiden's eyes as she replied,—"I shall not give her the
                  opportunity, though I am deeply grateful for your kind invitation,—more grateful
                  than you can well imagine."</p>
               <p>"I see the reputation I am likely to gain by taking my friend from you," said Miss
                  Mowbray in a playful tone; "and yet her presence is so necessary to me, I cannot
                  dispense with it, even to prove my unselfishness."</p>
               <p>"You see what you are coming to, Mr. Ashton," cried the judge, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Yes," sighed that gentleman; "but I shall call for Richard's help in such a
                  case."</p>
               <p>"I will bring lights," said Richard, leaving the room to conceal his emotion.</p>
               <p>Quickly sped the precious moments that drew evening to its close, and the hour of
                  separation nigh. Now the father <emph>felt</emph> the sacrifice;—now, too late, he
                  saw the worth for which his son had spurned his patrimony;—now he had given
                     <emph>millions,</emph> were they his, to imprint on that fair brow a father's
                  kiss,—to draw these <emph>children</emph> to his heart, and bid them evermore live
                  in each other's smile. In all Judge Morton's misfortunes, a more bitter pang had
                  never touched his heart, than that with which he gazed upon his son's unspoken
                  agony, as, taking Maggie's hand in his, Richard bent before his father for a
                  blessing, "ere they parted, perhaps for ever."</p>
               <p>Laying one trembling hand on her soft curls, while from her upturned eye he drank
                  a holy light, with the other he clasped their joined hands, and cried with choking
                  voice:—</p>
               <p>"My son,—my daughter, the blessing of an unworthy father,—of one whose blindness
                  and folly have caused you this bitter separation,—of one who now prays your
                  forgiveness, as from a higher source he has thus prayed,—the blessing of one whom
                  you have led into a heavenly path, whose riches, exceeding earth's, you pointed
                  out;—that blessing, thrice repeated, rest upon you now and for ever."</p>
               <p>Surpassingly sweet,—gloriously beautiful was the soul-lit smile which broke over
                  Maggie's features.</p>
               <p>"Gained at last," her heart said.</p>
               <p>"We shall meet again," her lips pronounced with prophetic joy.</p>

               <p>"THERE'S your odious brother, Mr. Atherton, coming up the walk."</p>
               <p>"Bless me! that's Joseph,—so it is;"—Mr. Atherton caught up his hat and ran out
                  delightedly.</p>
               <p>The lady's thin lips were firmly set as her husband returned, ushering in his
                  brother. But no pleasant, familiar kiss called up her haughty blood,—no rough but
                  kindly greeting awoke her slumbering sneer. For once, Uncle Joseph was as cold as
                  herself;—for the first time, Mark saw a cloud on his brother's face.</p>
               <p>"Now explain yourself, Joe," said he, as quick as they were seated; "what does all
                  this mean?"</p>
               <p>"Explain <emph>your</emph>self rather," said Uncle Joseph, bluntly; "do you
                  suppose I can stand it to see my boy—(<emph>mine,</emph> if he has got a father
                  and mother) abused?"</p>
               <p>"Abused!—your boy!"—Mark replied; "what <emph>do</emph> you mean, Joe?"</p>
               <p>"Why, haven't you abused Lonny and the whole of us? that's what I mean," Uncle
                  Joseph answered, with vexation.</p>
               <p>"How in the world have we abused you?" asked Mark, profoundly astonished.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you don't call it <emph>abuse,</emph> to suffer a young man like Lonny to
                  break his heart for one kind word from the girl he loves;—perhaps you don't call
                  it abuse, to let your own sister's letters lie unanswered, when you know how much
                  happiness you are thus destroying; perhaps you don't call such neglect
                     <emph>abuse;</emph> but <emph>I</emph> do—downright, unpardonable sin." Uncle
                  Joseph drew in his breath as he ceased.</p>
               <p>"Joe, for heaven's sake, tell me what you mean!" cried Mark, excitedly; "I have
                  received no letters; I have neglected no one, that I know of; least of all, my
                  sister."</p>
               <p>"Not received any letters! Didn't you get the one Lottie's husband wrote you,
                  asking for Nettie? Didn't you get hers, and his, and Lonny's, wanting you all to
                  come to the feast, and ever so many more, asking what you meant by not writing!"
                  Uncle Joseph exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Stop one moment, Joe; do you mean to say that such letters have been written to
                  us?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do mean to say so; and a pretty commotion there is because you don't
                  answer them. Lonny is down at the mouth as bad as he was before he found his
                  father; and Lottie and her husband are worrying their lives out about it. I
                  couldn't stand it any longer; so I've come to call you to an account, Mark."</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7276-00000162"/>
               <p>"Well you <emph>might,</emph> Joe, if I had done what you say; but, to tell you
                  the truth, I have felt almost hurt that Lottie seemed to forget me in her
                  prosperity; and especially that Lonny did not come, that Nettie might share his
                  happiness."</p>
               <p>"There! what a wretch I was, to talk to you so, Mark! give me your hand; I might
                  have known you better." Tears started in Joseph Atherton's eyes as he warmly
                  grasped his brother's hand.</p>
               <p>"But what the deuce has got those letters?" he added, after a moment's pause.</p>
               <p>"That is very mysterious," Mark replied; "I will institute inquiries at once;
                  there's some mischief at the bottom, I fear."</p>
               <p>"Mischief! you may be sure of that," said Uncle Joseph; "but I pity the one who's
                  found in it; that's all."</p>
               <p>"What makes you look so pale, Louisa?" he asked, as Mark, in his haste to fathom
                  the mystery, went off and left him alone with Mrs. Atherton.</p>
               <p>"I am not aware that I look unusually so," she coldly replied, turning her face
                  away from his gaze.</p>
               <p>"I noticed you turned very white when I spoke of those letters just now. By the
                  way, what do you think of that matter?"</p>
               <p>"I have my own affairs to attend to;—I do not think any thing about it."</p>
               <p>"I should think you would call that one of your own affairs, where Nettie is so
                  deeply concerned."</p>
               <p>"Nettie has no concern in any thing <emph>they</emph> may say or write," said Mrs.
                  Atherton, haughtily.</p>
               <p>"I guess you're mistaken there, Louisa; but where is the little puss?"</p>
               <p>"She is up stairs, writing to Mr. Selwyn, her future husband."</p>
               <p>"Her future husband, is he! So you are not going to let her have my boy, eh?"</p>
               <p>"I am not apt to change my decisions, sir; they were known some time ago."</p>
               <p>"But supposing she would rather marry Lonny, after all?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Atherton," said the lady, turning her flashing eye upon him, "I do not choose
                  to be insulted in my own house; I will thank you to cease your remarks about my
                  daughter."</p>
               <p>"Oh fie, Louisa! 'twould be all lost trouble for you to get vexed with
                     <emph>me;</emph> I'm nothing but a great rough fellow, you know," Joseph
                  replied, with the most provoking good nature; "with your leave I will call for
                  Nettie," he added, pulling the bell before she could prevent him.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Uncle Joseph! I am <emph>so</emph> happy to see you," cried the beautiful
                  girl, coming in with joyful haste to greet him.</p>
               <p>"There, I couldn't have scolded you if you had treated Lonny as bad as we
                  thought," said he, giving her a most affectionate kiss.</p>
               <p>"Who says I have treated Lonny unkindly?" she asked, with surprise.</p>
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7276-00000163"/>
               <p>"Nobody now; but he felt very bad because you didn't answer his letters."</p>
               <p>"He hasn't written to me, uncle," said Nettie, the tears springing to her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he has, ever so many times, and most broke his heart every time the mail
                  came in, because he didn't get any answer."</p>
               <p>"Is that so, Uncle Joseph?" she cried; "and I, grieving all the while at Lonny's
                  neglect! where are those letters?"</p>
               <p>"That's more than we can tell," said he; "your father has gone out to see about
                  it; but I should rather lose a thousand letters, than find my sweet Nettie here
                  false to Lonny."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Atherton, I must remind you that such language to a young lady on the eve of
                  marriage, is, to say the least, highly improper, and cannot be allowed in this
                  house. Nettie, have you no sense of shame about you?" Mrs. Atherton spoke
                  sharply.</p>
               <p>Nettie hesitated a moment, and then very mildly replied,—</p>
               <p>"I am not on the eve of marriage, mother; but if I were it would be with Lonny—no
                  one else."</p>
               <p>"Girl! you drive me distracted; leave the room instantly."</p>
               <p>The entrance of Mark Atherton prevented the enforcement of her mother's stern
                  command, and Nettie remained,—her hand still resting in Uncle Joseph's.</p>
               <p>"It is very strange," said Mark, with a frown; "the post-boy says he has brought
                     <emph>all</emph> our letters regularly to the house, and that he has often
                  observed that postmark among them; I must question the servants."</p>
               <p>"You need not trouble yourself to do that," said Mrs. Atherton, drawing herself up
                  with a defiant glance, while her face alternately paled and flushed; "our servants
                  know nothing of the matter."</p>
               <p>"Louisa! Oh, my God!" her husband groaned, sinking into a chair and covering his
                  face, as the terrible suspicion flashed into his mind.</p>
               <p>"Well, what have you to say, sir?" she coldly asked.</p>
               <p>No reply—none could have spoken at that moment; but Nettie sprang to her father's
                  side and laid her head upon his shoulder with a convulsive sob.</p>
               <p>"Quite dramatic!" sneered the heartless woman; "it is a pity you are not on the
                  stage, Nettie."</p>
               <p>"Woman, cease;"—thundered Mark, roused by her words to the indignation she
                  merited.</p>
               <p>"When I please, sir," she replied, trembling with passion; "Nettie, retire to your
                  room."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you had better, my child," said her father, in answer to Nettie's
                  questioning look; "it is too dreadful for you here."</p>
               <p>"But, father, I am a child no longer," Nettie pleaded; "I would much rather remain
                  with you."</p>
               <p>"Then stay."</p>
               <p>"And I bid you go!"—Mrs. Atherton laid her hand roughly upon Nettie's shoulder as
                  she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Hands off there," shouted Uncle Joseph, unable to contain himself longer; "you'd
                  better attend to your letter-stealing, and let her alone."</p>

               <p>"Mr. Atherton, I command you to turn this fellow from your house instantly," said
                  she, turning to her husband.</p>
               <p>"Not just yet," Uncle Joseph rejoined; "I shall be glad enough to go pretty soon,
                  but I've got something to say to you first."</p>
               <p>"I will not listen to you."</p>
               <p>"Then your husband will, and that'll do just as well; it is time you were taken
                  care of."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"What do I mean? I mean it is time the law put you where you ought to have been
                  long ago."</p>
               <p>"The law!" repeated Mrs. Atherton, her face becoming livid at such a possible
                  intimation.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the <emph>law,</emph> Mrs. Mark Atherton;"—Uncle Joseph was growing eloquent
                  in his vexation—"do you suppose there is no punishment for crimes like yours?"</p>
               <p>"Prove your words, if you would talk of crimes," she replied, recovering
                  herself.</p>
               <p>"Your face is all the proof I want," said Uncle Joseph; "it showed just as plainly
                  that you stole those letters, as though you'd said so; I saw it the minute I spoke
                  of them."</p>
               <p>"Louisa!" cried her husband, "if I could believe you guilty of any thing so
                  inexpressibly mean—so degrading,—so treacherous to your husband and child—"</p>
               <p>"Go on," said she insultingly, as he paused; "what would you do?"</p>
               <p>"I would leave you for ever;—so help me God!" Mark Atherton replied, in a voice of
                  terrible earnestness.</p>
               <p>It was her turn to cower now,—to shrink back, guilty thing that she was—into her
                  chair; to hide her face from the stern, unrelenting gaze of her husband. She felt
                  that the crisis had come—that her sin had overtaken her at last.</p>
               <p>"Leave us alone," said Mark, gently motioning his brother and daughter to
                  retire.</p>
               <p>What passed between the husband and wife in that long, and, to those who waited
                  anxiously without, almost interminable hour, none ever knew. At its close Mark
                  Atherton came forth pale and haggard, as though life's surges had swept over his
                  soul, leaving nought but an arid desert there.</p>
               <p>"You can take Nettie with you, Joseph," he said in a low voice; "she may remain at
                  Willow Glen till I send for her."</p>
               <p>"I cannot leave you now, father," Nettie replied, throwing her arms around his
                  neck; "let me stay and comfort you."</p>
               <p>"It is best so, my daughter," he tenderly replied; "you shall soon return to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"And mother?" Nettie asked, pointing to the door.</p>
               <p>"Alas! my child, you have a mother no longer, nor I a wife," Mr. Atherton replied
                  sadly; "she has chosen her own way,—let her abide by it. God pity and forgive her,
                  as I do."</p>
               <p>"No mother!" thought Nettie, as she rode away<pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000165"/> with Uncle Joseph; "for me she never had a mother's
                  tenderness. No mother?" she repeated as her thoughts flew to the end of her
                  journey; "was ever mother more beloved and honored—more precious to the heart of a
                  child, than Aunt Lottie—dear, dear Aunt Lottie is to me?"</p>
               <p>"I've brought you an answer, Lonny," joyfully shouted Uncle Joseph, as they
                  alighted at Willow Glen; "I told you 'twas none of Nettie's fault, and here she is
                  to tell you so too. But it's been a terrible business though," he added, going in;
                  "the old Jezebel is routed at last."</p>

               <p>A HORSE and rider rapidly advanced towards Woodbine Lodge. One who had been
                  watching the gorgeous autumnal sunset from her window, saw their approach, and
                  with a joyous smile ran to greet the welcome visitor.</p>
               <p>"What has brought you so soon, Richard?" she exclaimed; "you wrote that you should
                  not be here till next week."</p>
               <p>"Would it have pleased you better had I waited till then," he playfully asked,
                  reading his answer in her sparkling eye.</p>
               <p>"You know as well as I," she replied; "but I thought you had some important
                  business requiring your attention this week."</p>
               <p>"So I had; but something more important has since occurred. Where is Miss Mowbray?
                  I must see her at once."</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7276-00000166"/>
               <p>"So it is <emph>her</emph> for whom your visit is intended, is it?" the young lady
                  half pouted as she rang the bell; "pray what can you have to say to her of so much
                  importance? shall I retire?" she asked as Miss Mowbray appeared.</p>
               <p>"No, miss jealousy," said he, laughing; "remain where you are; I cannot spare you
                  from my sight."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mr. Morton," said Miss Mowbray, cordially greeting him; "I suspect the
                  servant made a mistake; she told me a gentleman waited here to see
                     <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No mistake at all," cried Maggie; "Richard inquired for you almost the first
                  thing after he came."</p>
               <p>"And thereby gained just the least bit of a reproach," he added with a smile.
                  "But, Miss Mowbray, I did come to see you;—to restore this gift, which I cannot
                  under any circumstances accept, noble and munificent as it is."</p>
               <p>"This gift!"—she repeated, unfolding the paper he handed her, and displaying
                  several bank bills of a large amount; "I do not comprehend you, Mr. Morton."</p>
               <p>"Did you not convey, or cause to be conveyed, to me that money—just the amount of
                  my father's indebtedness?" Richard asked, scrutinizing her face closely as he
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"Never, Mr. Morton, though it would give me great pleasure to say otherwise," she
                  replied unfalteringly.</p>
               <p>"Then the mystery is great indeed," said he; "I thought it could come from no
                  other source."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that such a sum has been sent you? and the giver unknown!" said
                  Maggie; "then it is some good fairy's gift, you may depend. How and when did you
                  receive it?"</p>
               <p>"Night before last, as I was returning home from the office, about dusk, a man,
                  whose face and form were concealed by a large cloak and slouched hat, accosted me
                  at the corner of a street, and inquired if my name was Morton—Richard Morton, Jun.
                  On my replying in the affirmative, he drew from his pocket a small parcel, which
                  he gave me without saying a word, and was out of my sight in an instant. Supposing
                  it might be something relating to a law-case now pending, I did not open the
                  packet till after supper, when father and I sat down to examine its contents.
                  Judge of our astonishment when these bills met our sight, with no word—no
                  intimation whence they came!"</p>
               <p>"What a romantic affair!" exclaimed Maggie, clapping her hands.</p>
               <p>"Romantic surely!" said Miss Mowbray; "but how came you to connect me with it, Mr.
                  Morton?"</p>
               <p>"We both pronounced it your work at once; partly because it is so like you; and
                  then our few friends are not wealthy, you know."</p>
               <p>"You would not have accepted it from me, then?"</p>
               <p>"I could not, Miss Mowbray; I could not rest under such an obligation to any
                  one."</p>
               <p>"But it seems you must, now,—at least until you can discover your secret
                  benefactor; which, under the circumstances, I much doubt if you will ever do."</p>
               <p>"Who knows but Mr. Ashton, or Mr. Selwyn, has taken this way to render the
                  assistance they have so frequently urged upon me."</p>
               <p>"Fortunately Mr. Ashton is here to answer for himself<pb n="324-325"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000167"/> self," said Miss Mowbray, dispatching a messenger
                  for him.</p>
               <p>"Come now," she laughingly added, as that gentleman entered the room; "we have
                  sent for you to hear your confession. Mr. Morton charges some one with a crime,
                  and we think it must be you."</p>
               <p>"Morton, my good fellow, how are you? What crime do you take me to be guilty of,
                  pray?"</p>
               <p>"The crime of highway—generosity," Richard jocosely replied.</p>
               <p>"That's a novel charge;—explain it, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Here is an explanation of it," said Richard, showing him the money; "some person,
                  with kindness aforethought, did forcibly detain me upon the public highway, and
                  then and there, by force and arms, thrust this upon me; said person, as your
                  deponent now believeth, being one Lewis Ashton, of and from the city of New
                  York."</p>
               <p>"Well done, my good lawyer; now let's have the real English of it," said Mr.
                  Ashton, laughing heartily.</p>
               <p>"Well, the simple English of it is, that this money—ten thousand dollars—has been
                  put into my hands by some unknown person; and I came here in the full belief that
                  Miss Mowbray was the generous donor; but she so strongly denies it, my suspicions
                  now rest upon you."</p>
               <p>"Upon me! then let me hasten at once to remove them. I cannot for a moment claim
                  the honor of that noble deed."</p>
               <p>"Nor Mr. Selwyn?" Richard asked.</p>
               <p>"I think I can answer for him; I do not believe it was he."</p>
               <p>"Then, in heaven's name! who was it? for I know of no other friend on earth,
                  except—yes, it must be Mr. Thornton!"</p>
               <p>"Why don't you ask <emph>me</emph> if I sent it," Maggie asked mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Because I know your heart and purse are not equally balanced," Richard replied
                  with a loving glance. "But come, walk with me to Willow Glen; I am impatient to
                  unravel the mystery."</p>
               <p>"I would receive it as a gift from the gods," was Melville Thornton's pleasant
                  rejoinder to Richard's tale. "Miss Mowbray, you say, denies it;—Mr. Ashton and Mr.
                  Selwyn likewise;—and I, too, must disclaim all knowledge of the matter. Whoever
                  sent it, has probably taken such precautions that you can never trace them; and
                  therefore I advise you to apply it, as it was evidently intended you should, to
                  remove all your father's indebtedness."</p>
               <p>"I do not dare to indulge the blessed dream!" Richard exclaimed with emotion; "to
                  have the labor of years thus suddenly lifted from me!—it cannot be; it is not for
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"You have no right to say that, Richard; devotion like yours I have known even
                  more strangely rewarded. Take it, Richard, you are worthy of it; and so, I doubt
                  not, the happy giver thinks."</p>
               <p>"Can you imagine, Maggie," said Richard, as they slowly retraced their steps
                  towards Woodbine Lodge,<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7276-00000168"/> —"can you even
                  dream of the joy that thrilled my soul as I listened to Mr. Thornton?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and my heart rejoiced with you, that your burden is thus lightened, your
                  father saved, without the long plodding toil to which you looked forward."</p>
               <p>"No, it was not that, Maggie, though God alone knows how great would be my joy to
                  see my father free;—it was something dearer yet—something which flashed with
                  heaven's glory into my spirit! You will not think me beside myself,—you will not
                  deem me mad, dearest, if for one moment—one rapturous moment, I dreamed that now
                  we might not be parted;—that the toil so dreaded might now be devoted to rearing a
                  home around my Maggie;—might be sweetened by her presence—be crowned by a
                     <emph>wife's</emph> blessing!"</p>
               <p>"And why may it not be?" she asked in a voice so low he stooped to hear.</p>
               <p>"Do I hear aright?" he cried, grasping both her hands, and raising her face, that
                  he might read its truth;—"do <emph>you,</emph> Maggie—idol of my heart—do you bid
                  me hope that such a dream <emph>may</emph> be mine? Bless you ten thousand times,
                  dearest, for those words:—but, it cannot be!"—he added, dropping her hands and
                  resuming their walk.</p>
               <p>"Shall you accept Mr. Thornton's advice?" Maggie asked after a moment's
                  silence.</p>
               <p>"Not at present;—not till I have tried every possible means to discover my too
                  generous friend,"—Richard replied.</p>
               <p>"But if you do not succeed?"</p>
               <p>"Why, then—but I must not indulge such a thought; I <emph>must</emph> succeed,
                  Maggie; I cannot feel the weight of such an obligation all my life."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps that was the reason your friend, whoever he was, adopted such a course.
                  The obligation must rest lightly upon you, where the author is purposely
                  concealed."</p>
               <p>"You speak as though you would have me retain it, Maggie," said Richard, half
                  reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"I would not have you throw away any of God's gifts, or lightly esteem a
                  Providence which thus blesses you, Richard," she replied quietly.</p>
               <p>"Neither would I owe all my blessings to other than my own labor," Richard added
                  decidedly.</p>
               <p>"Take care, Richard; is there no pride there?" she archly queried.</p>
               <p>"Pride? yes; but honest pride is no sin," he replied; "tell me truly, Maggie,
                  would you respect me if I had none?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell you nothing now," said she as they reached the door; "but I would
                  exact one promise from you."</p>
               <p>"I do not fear to pledge myself to any thing you may ask; what is it, love?"</p>
               <p>"That if, after one month's unceasing effort, you do not succeed in finding your
                  invisible friend, you will then come to me and be guided by my words. Is that very
                  assuming, Richard?" she playfully added, as he looked down thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"Nothing can be assuming that you may suggest,"<pb n="328-329"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000169"/> he replied; "I was weighing your words:—I promise,
                  dearest."</p>
               <p>Four weeks quickly passed in such earnest, untiring, but unavailing efforts as
                  Richard Morton, aided by his father, made. The month at last came round, bringing
                  no ray of light upon his search,—leaving him just where it found him. It were
                  difficult to describe the conflicting emotions with which he presented himself at
                  Woodbine Lodge. Hope, half trembling;—fear, scarcely defined, struggled for
                  mastery in his heart, as he found himself once more in the presence of his
                  betrothed.</p>
               <p>"True to your word, Richard," she exclaimed with a beaming smile; "just as I
                  expected."</p>
               <p>"Then you were sure of my failure?"</p>
               <p>"I had but little faith in your success, I confess," she replied; "but do you
                  regret your promise?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the least; it relieves me from the responsibility of acting for myself,
                  which just now is very agreeable, especially when such safe and precious hands
                  assume the helm," Richard lovingly added.</p>
               <p>"And you are ready now to redeem that promise? to be guided by what I shall
                  say?"—Maggie trembled as she asked this.</p>
               <p>"I know of no reason to reverse my decision," said he, taking her hand; "nor do I
                  see any cause for your agitation, dearest."</p>
               <p>"It may seem unmaidenly in me, Richard," she began, while the warm blood sent its
                  rich crimson hue to her cheek; "but your peculiar position compels me to
                  speak."</p>
               <p>"Are we not one, my Maggie?" he whispered encouragingly in her ear; "then do not
                  fear to say all there is in your heart."</p>
               <p>"I cannot say <emph>all,</emph> Richard; it would take a lifetime to do that," she
                  replied,—"such a lifetime as I am now vainly endeavoring to ask of you."—She could
                  utter no more, but hid her face in her hands to conceal her emotion.</p>
               <p>"Maggie, darling! what mean you?" cried Richard, unable to comprehend her words;
                  "would not such a lifetime be the heaven of my existence?—that for which my soul
                  yearns with longings unutterable?—that for which I would sacrifice every thing,
                  save my honor!—tell me, dearest—for your words shadow some meaning,—is there any
                  hope for me?—any door by which I may enter this earthly paradise?"</p>
               <p>"I will speak frankly to you, Richard, for I know you will understand me,"—and she
                  laid her hand softly into his,—"I think it is your duty to accept that gift, and
                  appropriate it as your heart suggests; then for the future,"—she hesitated: "yes,
                  I will say it,—you can, if you will, accompany us to Mowbray Hall; Miss Mowbray
                  has had news of the death of her attorney, and expects to find her affairs in some
                  confusion. It will need just such a clear head as yours to arrange them, and she
                  bade me ask you to accept the trust, which will be one of sufficient emolument to
                  support your parents,<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7276-00000170"/> yourself,
                  and"—she paused with a downcast look and bright blush,—</p>
               <p>"And my <emph>wife!</emph>" he added almost solemnly as the truth broke over him;
                  "stop one moment, Maggie; I cannot comprehend it,—I cannot believe that you are in
                  earnest. Say again, that all this <emph>may</emph> be true!"</p>
               <p>"It all awaits your acceptance," she simply answered.</p>
               <p>"And you—"</p>
               <p>"Remember your promise."</p>
               <p>"I do; it shall be as you say."</p>
               <p>"Then prepare to accompany us. Now let us seek my friend, Miss Mowbray."</p>
               <p>Richard walked as one in a dream, to the adjoining apartment. There he heard the
                  whole arrangement from Miss Mowbray's own lips. He saw a path, bright and shining,
                  open before him,—honor and prosperity within his grasp. He saw his father's broken
                  health restored,—his mother's life renewed. Above all, he saw the gentle hand
                  which had wrought this change, and turning towards her, with almost reverential
                  devotion he fell upon his knees, exclaiming, "God make me worthy of thee, my
                  peerless bride—my angel deliverer!"</p>

               <p>ALONE in his library Mark Atherton again sits,—not as thirteen years ago he sat
                  there, with the shadows of fear just creeping about him;—not as then, looking
                  forward to the future, with a dim, uncertain hope, that threatened evil might, by
                  a kind overruling Providence, be turned at last to good,—that the seeds then sown
                  might be checked in their growth, ere they seized in their tendril grasp the heart
                  of his first-born,—that the poisonous inhalations that son received from his
                  mother, might find an antidote in the beautiful, exemplary life of his sister; not
                  as then, bewailing the faults, but still loving the wife he had chosen,—not as
                  then, with the glow of health—the spring of activity in his frame—the dark locks,
                  the flashing eye, which spoke of youthful blood still lingering in his veins.</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7276-00000171"/>
               <p>Now he sits there to meditate on the ruin of all his hopes; his head is silvered,
                  his eye dimmed, his brow wrinkled, his frame still trembling and quivering under
                  the last blow that has fallen upon him. Wife, he has none; for she who bore that
                  sacred name, has, in her ungovernable fury, broken the last link that bound them;
                  with imprecations and curses on her lips, she has gone from him. "Would he recall
                  her?"—he repeats the question to himself; as in answer comes the echoing of far
                  off years, filled with pride and arrogance, angry strife and heartless deeds,
                  followed quickly by direful memories of filial ingratitude, of ignominious death,
                  of hopeless redemption, crowned by base treachery and deceit! Who can wonder that
                  the heart of the husband had been alienated,—that, looking back from the point
                  where he now stood, his forbearance ceased, his love fled, and loathing, only less
                  bitter than she merited, followed the unhappy woman to her exile.</p>
               <p>Brighter than the sunniest spot on earth,—more refreshing than the desert's oasis
                  to the worn-out traveller, was the sweet vision which gently rose higher and
                  higher before that dark background. Nettie, simple and pure in spirit—the
                  embodiment of perfection to her father's heart, stood before him. Not bodily,
                  though she was even then obeying his summons and hastening towards him; but to his
                  soul she came, driving from thence all the dark fancies, the fearful images he had
                  conjured there. With her dear face, so sweetly blended that they seemed but the
                  face of one, he saw his mother's mild gaze bent upon him; his sister's loving ing
                  smile—that sister who had moulded the fresh young nature of his beautiful child.
                  In a moment, years had vanished;—again he was the child—the youth—the man, beneath
                  his mother's roof; again her words of wisdom, her spotless life, her glorious
                  death, were with him; again he stood by the lifeless clay, whose departed spirit,
                  as it upward soared, he had so longed to follow to its bright home; again, with a
                  hand in each of his, he repeated the promise made that sainted mother; again he
                  soothed the weeping sister, the sobbing brother, and with them registered a vow,
                  that their mother's legacy, whose earthly possessions had all been wrought into
                  those letters of gold, should be sacredly fulfilled in their future lives,—that
                  the precept she had left them should run like a soft golden thread through all
                  their actions, that at last the blessing she had so earnestly evoked, might rest
                  upon them.</p>
               <p>His sister's life had been a beautiful transcript of that legacy; his brother's
                  name had become proverbial for all that was good and noble in its spirit; but what
                  had <emph>he</emph> ever done?—where was even his first effort to redeem that
                  solemn pledge? What if he had been benevolent, as the world esteems
                  benevolence?—what if he had freely given whenever asked?—had never turned aside
                  from the poor and needy? His had not been the spirit with which his sister went
                  about doing good; he had not <emph>sought out</emph> the abodes of sorrow; he had
                  not given, what is sometimes more precious than gold, the sympathy of a
                     <emph>brother's</emph> heart.</p>
               <p>This long review—these deep communings, were<pb n="334-335"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000172"/> lighting up the latent spark within; new
                  resolutions, new hopes, new joys, began to fill his soul,—he heeded not the hours
                  as they passed over him. Softly were they gliding into evening's dusk, when a
                  voice, familiar in its rough accent, aroused him from his reverie.</p>
               <p>"There, children, I told you so," cried Uncle Joseph; "I thought we should find
                  him moped up here. Come Mark, old fellow, cheer up; we'll drive the blues off now;
                  see what a handsome pair of chicks I've brought you."</p>
               <p>"Nettie darling!"—the beautiful girl was clasped to her father's heart.</p>
               <p>"Dear father, have you been very lonely? I came as soon as your letter reached
                  me," Nettie murmured.</p>
               <p>"That's what she did," said Uncle Joseph; "she hardly gave us time to get ready,
                  did she, Lonny? By the way, Mark, you haven't seen my boy this long while. Would
                  you believe this handsome fellow was the same chap I took from Clifton so long
                  ago?"</p>
               <p>"Time makes wonderful changes," said Mark, shaking hands cordially with the young
                  man; "I am very happy to see you, Lonny. I scarcely know whether to congratulate
                  you or Mr. Thornton most, in your newly discovered relations to each other. He is
                  worthy a noble son, and you—"</p>
               <p>"I guess I wouldn't finish that," interrupted Joseph; "he's been flattered enough
                  already; give him some good sound lessons—that's the best thing for him."</p>
               <p>"Who has been guilty of the greatest flattery, Uncle Joseph?" asked Lonny,
                  smiling.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, but you don't mind my nonsense you know, if I do sometimes call you the
                  best fellow that ever lived. He is so, Mark, that's a fact. Come now, if you've
                  got any supper, you'll find a set of hungry visitors."</p>
               <p>Uncle Joseph's jovial, off-hand manner cleared away the clouds which might have
                  hung over this first meeting, after such sad domestic occurrences. But no cloud
                  could long rest in the sunshine of his heart, which carried its glow to his honest
                  face.</p>
               <p>"I had forgotten all about supper," said Mark, ringing the bell; "I hope the
                  servants have not been as neglectful as their master."</p>
               <p>"Let me go, father," cried Nettie; "remember, it is my place <emph>now,</emph>"
                  she whispered in his ear as she passed out of the room.</p>
               <p>The allusion brought a deep sigh from Mark Atherton's breast.</p>
               <p>"There, Lonny, you go and help Nettie," said Uncle Joseph; "I want to see my
                  brother just a minute. Now, Mark," he added, as they were left alone, "it's best
                  for you and me to talk this thing right over now. You feel bad enough, that I can
                  see; and if there's one person on earth that loves you—that would give his right
                  hand to make you as happy as you deserve, that person is your brother Joe. Give me
                  your hand, Mark—I'll stand by you as long as I live,"—two great tears rolled down
                  Joseph's cheek as he grasped his brother's hand.</p>
               <p>"If I had always been as good as you, Joe," said<pb n="336-337"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000173"/> Mark with deep emotion, "this punishment might
                  never have come upon me."</p>
               <p>"Oh come, don't talk about goodness now,"—cried Joseph; "I've got none to boast
                  of. But tell me what I can do for you; that's what I want to know."</p>
               <p>"Your presence has already cheered me," Mark replied.</p>
               <p>"Then you don't feel hurt with me because I brought Louisa out in that scrape? You
                  don't think I meant her any harm, do you?"</p>
               <p>"It is painful to speak of <emph>her,</emph>" said Mark; "but as you say, I think
                  it is best we should talk it over now, and then let the subject drop for ever. I
                  did not think of blaming you, Joe; on the contrary, I am grateful that you stopped
                  the mischief when you did."</p>
               <p>"I suspected some foul play, Mark; and to tell you the truth, it hit just where I
                  expected it would."</p>
               <p>"I could not have believed her guilty of such despicable meanness—such
                  treachery"—said Mark.</p>
               <p>"I did; has she gone for good?" Uncle Joseph asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, this house will never more afford her shelter," replied Mark decidedly; "but
                  I have settled upon her a sufficient sum to make her comfortable as long as she
                  lives."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mark, you mustn't think hard of me, if I tell you I'm right glad she's out
                  of your way. You haven't had such an easy life with her as to make you mourn much,
                  I know."</p>
               <p>"I mourn not over our separation, Joe; 'tis better so; but I do mourn, how
                  grievously you cannot know, that I did not remove our children from her influence.
                  Who knows but Albert might have been saved, had I been more determined—more
                  faithful in my duty to him?"</p>
               <p>"You must not reproach yourself, Mark; you have done a thousand times better than
                  I should in your place. Look at Nettie; isn't she a comfort to you now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but who knows what she might have been, were it not for Lottie's influence
                  over her—her early teachings?"</p>
               <p>"She never could have been any thing <emph>but</emph> good, Mark," Joseph
                  enthusiastically replied; "she's just like you for all the world. Don't you
                  remember how vexed you used to be, because mother said you would make a great deal
                  better man than I?"</p>
               <p>"Mother was mistaken for once," said Mark; "I was thinking of her just before you
                  came; how vividly every thing connected with her came to my mind, especially her
                  last hours, her solemn admonitions, her blessed legacy, which has made you, Joe,
                  and Lottie so near perfection."</p>
               <p>"You may call Lottie as near perfection as you choose; you won't hit very wide of
                  the mark," said Joseph, smiling; "but when you come to me, you're all off your
                  track;—there, I hear the children coming—we'd better not talk about your matters
                  before them, had we?"</p>
               <p>"No, not a word," Mark replied; "some time I will<pb n="338-339"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000174"/> tell Nettie all that it is best for her to know;
                  but now I would make her home cheerful and happy."</p>
               <p>"See, father, what a present I have just received," cried Nettie, coming in with a
                  little box in her hand, from which she displayed a set of precious and costly
                  pearl ornaments.</p>
               <p>"It is easy to guess where these came from," he replied, smiling, as he glanced
                  from the jewels to Lonny's face.</p>
               <p>"But you haven't guessed rightly, though; they are not Lonny's gift," she added
                  rather soberly; "he would not be so extravagant, I hope."</p>
               <p>"Not Lonny's gift! whose is it, then?"</p>
               <p>"Listen, and I will read this note to you, though I do not deserve such a
                  compliment." Nettie blushed as she began.</p>
               <p>"I send you these jewels, my dear girl, as emblematical of yourself. Simple, pure
                  and chaste, their intrinsic value far outweighs the glittering gems and gaudy
                  baubles found in fashion's train. Like you, dear Nettie, they remind one of
                  angelic life; like you, may their giver at last enter those <emph>pearly</emph>
                  gates which are opened for the redeemed alone. Wear these pearls, Nettie, at the
                  approaching nuptials of your friends. When your own arrives, a more befitting
                  remembrance will be given by one who thinks of you but to bless you.—SELWYN."</p>
               <p>"Noble! generous!" cried Mark as she ceased; "but what nuptials does he refer to,
                  Nettie?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray and Miss Singleton are both to be married Thanksgiving evening;
                  hadn't you heard of it, father?"</p>
               <p>"No; to whom, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray marries Mr. Ashton, the lawyer with whom Richard Morton remained in
                  New York. Richard and Miss Singleton are to be united at the same time; and then
                  they are all going to Miss Mowbray's residence in England. Isn't that nice,
                  father? and Richard takes his parents with him."</p>
               <p>"We've all got to be at that wedding, so they say," Uncle Joseph remarked; "you'll
                  go, Mark, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Me? I'll wait for an invitation, I think."</p>
               <p>"I have got one for you, father," said Nettie; "and the ladies both insisted on
                  your accompanying me. I shall take no denial, I assure you; I am going to be first
                  bridesmaid. How thoughtful in Mr. Selwyn, to send me the very thing I wanted most
                  to wear!"—and her eye rested with a grateful smile on the rich gift.</p>
               <p>"I suppose, if you are bridesmaid, you want me to stand up with you," her father
                  said quizzically.</p>
               <p>"It was for the purpose of claiming that honor, sir, that I came here now," Lonny
                  replied for her.</p>
               <p>"Did you think it necessary to ask me?" said Mr. Atherton, pleasantly.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I should not, sir, had I not a more precious boon to crave," Lonny
                  replied; then, stopping a moment, he again spoke: "you know so well the story of
                  my love for your daughter, sir, that it needs no repetition here. I resolved,
                  years ago, never to enter your door, or ask permission to wed Nettie, till I could
                     offer<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7276-00000175"/> her, at least, an unquestioned
                  name. Heaven has granted me one, more noble than even my highest hopes could
                  anticipate, Will you consent that your daughter shall share it, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Lonny," said Mark Atherton, agitatedly, "had you asked me years ago, I should
                  have given you the same answer that I now do. You were worthy then; you are still
                  worthy. Take her; and in this proof of my confidence and esteem,—the greatest I
                  could bestow, read only your own noble deserts."</p>
               <p>"There, Mark, you've said just what I wanted you to," cried Uncle Joseph, wiping
                  his eyes; "he's worthy of her, and she's worthy of him. Come here, my children;
                  let Uncle Joseph tell you, if he can, how he blesses God for this hour;—how his
                  heart swells up to see his noble boy rewarded. Lonny and Nettie," he added,
                  raising his hands, "when I call upon Heaven to bless you, as I now do, in that
                  blessing I must include <emph>her,</emph> to whom you owe each other! What and
                  where would you have been, my children, but for AUNT LOTTIE?"</p>

               <p>"WELCOME home, Richard! well, what success now?"</p>
               <p>"Such as you will not be prepared to hear, father."</p>
               <p>"Ah! then it <emph>was</emph> her, after all; I suspected so from the first."</p>
               <p>"No, father; the mystery about that money is still as great as ever; it was not
                  Miss Mowbray's gift, I am perfectly confident; but she has bestowed one that is
                  even greater than that."</p>
               <p>"What is it, Richard?"—Judge Morton could not tell from Richard's face whether it
                  was good or ill news he brought.</p>
               <p>"She has opened for us a path of honor and independence; one in which you, father,
                  may find that rest you need;—may be free from the toil which it has grieved me to
                  see you bear."</p>
               <p>"Explain yourself, Richard," said his father; "your words and looks do not
                  correspond exactly."</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7276-00000176"/>
               <p>"I have not yet recovered from the stunning effect of such sudden joy," Richard
                  replied; "to have one's life so changed, as in a moment, is like emerging at once
                  from a rayless night to the sun's meridian brightness. We are no longer poor,
                  father! we are rich—rich in the dearest sense of the word, to me."</p>
               <p>"How is that? then you have concluded to keep the money?"—the Judge looked
                  puzzled.</p>
               <p>"What else can I do with it—unless I throw it away?" said Richard; "father, I have
                  made up my mind that Providence intended it for us;—that, like all other
                  blessings, we must use it thankfully and faithfully. But what I referred to was
                  the offer Miss Mowbray has made me, to become her attorney—to take charge of her
                  estates, which, she says, will require one's whole time, and afford a very large
                  income. What do you say to that, father? do you wonder my head was a little turned
                  by such a dazzling prospect?" he asked, laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible!—has Miss Mowbray made you such an offer? Why, where is her old
                  attorney, Mr. Broughton?"</p>
               <p>"He is dead; and her affairs have been left without any one to manage them for
                  some time. She expects to find them in a good deal of confusion; and therefore it
                  will be necessary to return with her to Mowbray Hall. Can you realize it,
                  father?—that the voyage your physician recommended, as the only means of your
                  cure, is so near at hand?—that your laboring days are over?—that your son will now
                  have the proud satisfaction tion of placing his father in the position he
                  deserves?—that—"</p>
               <p>"Stop! stop! Richard," cried Judge Morton; "I am bewildered! Is all this true?—are
                  you really going to England so soon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; and you and mother also, if you will."</p>
               <p>"What salary did she propose to give you?"</p>
               <p>"No sum was mentioned, sir; but Miss Mowbray said it would be sufficient to
                  support us all handsomely. The papers will be drawn up after we get there; and she
                  says she has no doubt I shall find it all satisfactory."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt either," said the Judge; "I remember it afforded Mr. Broughton a
                  very handsome living. Then you and Maggie will not be separated, after all."</p>
               <p>"Never, I trust," responded Richard; "she will become my wife at the same time
                  Miss Mowbray is united to Mr. Ashton. She is the good angel who has brought all
                  this to pass."</p>
               <p>"She has ever been your 'good angel,' Richard. Do you remember the harsh terms I
                  applied to her long ago, which drove you from me, as they should?"</p>
               <p>"We've too much to think of now, father, to recall those old matters," Richard
                  replied, cheerfully; "let them rest where they are."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to recall them, Richard," said his father; "but before she becomes
                  your wife, I must tell you how entirely my views are changed;—how much more I
                  prize such a character as hers than all the gold in the world."</p>
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7276-00000177"/>
               <p>"Then you have no lingering regret that it is not Miss Mowbray that I wed?"</p>
               <p>"No; if I know my own heart, I have none. I respect Miss Mowbray most sincerely;
                  but Maggie fills even <emph>my</emph> heart with a happiness wealth could not
                  bring; what then must she be to you, my son!"</p>
               <p>"She is my life," Richard simply answered.</p>
               <p>"What shall we do first?" Mrs. Morton asked, in her confused delight, as the news
                  was broken to her astonished ears.</p>
               <p>"The first thing to be done," Richard replied emphatically, "is to pay to the
                  uttermost farthing every dollar father owes. The few effects we have can then be
                  very quickly disposed of," he added, with a smiling glance around their scantily
                  furnished apartment.</p>
               <p>"But it is so soon!"—she urged; "how can we get ready?"</p>
               <p>"A great deal can be done in two weeks, mother," said Richard; "especially when
                  hearts and hands are as light as ours."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Morton found her son's words literally true; as, before the two weeks closed,
                  old friends came thronging to her humble home, to congratulate her on Richard's
                  rumored fortune—increasing, as such rumors usually do, with each day's gossip,
                  till its immensity was astonishing. "A great deal" must have been done, surely, to
                  have so changed cold faces into the smiling, fawning ones that flocked about them
                  now. Some potent charm had reached their hearts at last, which awoke them suddenly
                  to the remembrance of their "dear old friends, the Mortons."</p>
               <p>But gossip was not confined to the fortunes of the Mortons; it spread its
                  omniscient wings over the busy little village surrounding Woodbine Lodge. Every
                  morning it issued its bulletin, through its accredited agents, Misses Tompkins and
                  Pitkins. The number and quality of Miss Mowbray's dresses;—her magnificent
                  diamonds, just arrived from England;—that insufferable, citified, stuck up
                  dressmaker, that might, if she would, give them so much coveted information about
                  that most important of all things—the bridal robe;—Miss Singleton's presumption in
                  having a white satin dress, when every body knew she was only a dependant on the
                  heiress;—who were to be the bridesmaids; and, above all, who would receive
                  invitations to the greatest wedding ever known in those parts—were fruitful
                  subjects for daily conjecture and discussion by these worthies. The most trivial
                  acts or words of the unconscious objects of their espionage, were at once caught
                  up, decked in glowing colors, and triumphantly heralded from house to house, as
                  "the latest news."</p>
               <p>Alas! that so many of our lovely rural villages should be infested with these evil
                  genii—these Tompkins and Pitkins of every shade! An incubus on the happy growth of
                  any community! the broad Upas under which many hearts wither and die!</p>
               <p>But the happy inmates of Woodbine Lodge little knew or cared with what importance
                  their slightest movements were regarded by their neighbors. Their<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000178"/> own bright, blissful anticipations, would have put
                  to flight a hundred such evil-winged messengers. Could any of those gossiping
                  villagers have obtained but one glimpse into the room we are about to enter,
                  wonders would never have ceased; for there, in the middle of the chamber, stood
                  the blushing "dependant," clad in almost royal magnificence. Over a robe of snowy
                  velvet, like a vapory cloud thrown about her, fell in soft, mazy folds, a rich and
                  costly lace. Encircling her slight waist was a girdle of precious stones; while
                  around her neck and arms and crowning her rich curls, flashed the magnificent
                  heir-looms of her father's house. Yet, in this queenly dress, sitting with such
                  natural ease and grace upon her perfect form, Lucille Mowbray looked not more
                  lovely than when, in simple disguise, she gained a father's blessing in Richard's
                  lowly home. It was evident, however, that her companions did not thus think, as
                  they stood there devouring her rare loveliness with such admiring eyes.</p>
               <p>"Now, Lucille," exclaimed one of them, "you look like yourself again—just as you
                  used to go to parties, only more <emph>bridish</emph>—more beautiful than
                  ever."</p>
               <p>"Hush, Maggie, no flattery; I tried this dress on to please you; how do you like
                  it? and you too, Aunt Blair—tell me what <emph>you</emph> think of it."</p>
               <p>"It is superb—just what the daughter of Sir Charles Mowbray should wear at her
                  bridal."</p>
               <p>"It almost bewilders me, my darling, to see you so suddenly transformed," said
                  Mrs. Blair, smiling; "it is indeed magnificent—more so than any thing I ever saw;
                  but you must not accuse me of flattery, my dear, if I add that it is not more so
                  than you deserve."</p>
               <p>"You are both determined to spoil me, I see; so I'll quickly resume my simple
                  dress, which in truth I love better than these diamonds."</p>
               <p>"Simplicity cannot hide, nor diamonds dim the precious jewel concealed here," said
                  Maggie, tapping her shoulder with tender playfulness; "but I cannot help thinking
                  what a consternation there will be among our guests next Thursday night, when you
                  suddenly flash upon them in your true light."</p>
               <p>"I dread it more than you can imagine, Maggie."</p>
               <p>"I don't dread it, Lucille dear; I shall glory in your triumph over some of
                  them,—Mr. Flint, for instance."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha!"—rang out Lucille's merry laugh; "how he will stammer and a-hem, and
                  try to make some sort of speech to me! I can imagine just how he will look and
                  talk. Then those friends of <emph>yours</emph> from the city, Maggie, who thought
                  so strangely of your intimacy with your 'companion,' and who gave me no very
                  gentle hints that I ought to understand my position better—that I was a 'vain
                  little hireling,' and sundry other pleasant epithets,—what <emph>do</emph> you
                  suppose they will say?"</p>
               <p>"Their discomfiture is what I shall enjoy most,—they saw so much 'native elegance'
                  in me;—'it was so easy to distinguish one of high birth,' &amp;c. Alas! poor me, I
                  shall lose those 'distinguishing' marks at once."</p>
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7276-00000179"/>
               <p>"But seriously, Maggie dear, what most of all I dread is, lest Richard should
                  condemn such deception even for any purpose;"—Lucille looked grave as she said
                  this.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ashton did not, and why should Richard? Lewis said he thought it would be a
                  most salutary lesson to all our friends,—teaching them not to judge of others by
                  outward appearances."</p>
               <p>"Well, I see no harm in it, so far as our friends are concerned; but Richard, you
                  know, is different; he is such a perfect model of truth and honor; and then, to
                  carry the deception so far—not even giving him the power to withdraw if he
                  chooses!"</p>
               <p>"These are new troubles with you, darling; you have been congratulating yourself
                  on the noble reward Richard would at last receive for all his sufferings;—now
                  answer me truly, Lucille; do you think the knowledge of your fortune would drive
                  him from you?"</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot say that;" Lucille replied promptly.</p>
               <p>"Then drive away these foolish fears—these idle fancies. You wished to learn your
                  true value,—to be loved for yourself alone, and that wish has been granted; you
                  are prized and loved as you deserve to be, dear Lucille; let your heart be
                  satisfied."</p>
               <p>"My dears, Miss Page is below," said Mrs. Blair, putting her head in at the door;
                  "what! not dressed yet! and Lucille in tears! I thought you were very merry when I
                  left you."</p>
               <p>"They are happy tears, dear aunt; we will be down directly."</p>
               <p>"The man said you wanted to see me on some very particular business," said Miss
                  Priscilla, courtesying low as the ladies entered the room where she was.</p>
               <p>"We did, Miss Page," said the one we must still call Miss Mowbray; "you are
                  doubtless aware that my friend and I intend to return to England shortly."</p>
               <p>"Yes'm," quickly added Miss Priscilla; "but perhaps you don't know how many
                  prayers will follow you there."</p>
               <p>"We shall be grateful to know that any do," Miss Mowbray replied; "but I have sent
                  for you, Miss Priscilla, to consult you about some arrangements we are desirous of
                  making."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure, ma'am, you honor me too much."</p>
               <p>"Not at all; we have been thinking over all our acquaintances here, and we know of
                  no one in whom we can place more trust than yourself. Now, to come directly to the
                  point, Miss Page, will you assume the charge of this house in our absence? We
                  shall of course furnish you suitable assistants, and will make your compensation
                  good."</p>
               <p>"Miss Mowbray, do you ask me that in real earnest?" said Miss Priscilla, tears
                  springing to her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do, and shall feel very thankful to you if you will accept the trust.
                  It will be rather lonely; but perhaps you have some friend who would stay here
                  with you."</p>
               <p>"Now, see what comes o' havin' faith!" cried Miss<pb n="350-351"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000180"/> Priscilla, wholly overcome with her good fortune;
                  "I was a telling Polly Bemis no longer ago than yesterday, that I didn't know what
                  the Lord was a goin' to do with me this winter, for I hadn't got nothin' laid up.
                  'Oh, Miss Priscilla,' says Polly, says she to me, 'you may depend on't somethin'
                  'll turn up for ye,—only have faith;' and now you see, Miss Mowbray, the Lord has
                  put it into your head to help me. But I'm afeared I ain't capable enough."</p>
               <p>"I'll venture that; all you'll have to do is to keep the house in order; you can
                  reserve two or three rooms for your own use and shut up the rest. Care and
                  trustworthiness are the qualities needed, and I know you have them. Wouldn't your
                  friend, Miss Bemis, like to come and live here with you?"</p>
               <p>"Polly would be dredful glad I'm sure, ma'am, if you'd allow her; how long before
                  you'll come back?"</p>
               <p>"That is uncertain at present, but very likely next spring; at all events, we wish
                  to feel that this lovely home is ready for us at any time."</p>
               <p>"I'm sure, Miss Mowbray, the Lord 'll bless you for doin' such great things for
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I think I am the fortunate one in securing such faithful services. But there's
                  another thing I want you to do, and that is, to preside over the supper in the
                  servants' hall next Thursday evening; to see that every body is properly taken
                  care of, and then distribute the gifts which we shall prepare for them. What do
                  you say to that?"</p>
               <p>"My heart is too full, Miss Mowbray; I can't talk now; but I'll serve you, that I
                  will, faithful and true. I must go down to Polly's now,—indeed I can't hold in no
                  longer. What <emph>will</emph> Polly say!" and with her apron to her eyes, where
                  tears were streaming fast, Miss Priscilla flew to her friend.</p>

               <p>BRIGHTLY dawned the day, whose hours came freighted with such momentous
                  interest;—never shone a fairer Thanksgiving sun;—softer winds never sighed among
                  the leafless trees on this time-honored festival. Nature seemed, in the plenitude
                  of her joy, to foreshadow the cloudless existence of her favored children—for such
                  were those whose lives were this day to be blended.</p>
               <p>The last act of the drama was fast drawing nigh. Well had its self-constituted
                  actors performed their parts; "life's lesson" had been learned—the world
                  tested;—naught now remained but the grand denouement, where virtue should receive
                  its meed—worldliness its rebuke.</p>
               <p>Preparations had been made in a style befitting the fair hostess' princely
                  fortune. Mowbray Hall could not have boasted more taste or elegance than were
                  displayed played in the arrangements at Woodbine Lodge. Lucille would resign her
                  father's proud and honored name, as became the heiress of a Mowbray. Now that she
                  rested so securely in the worthiness of him to whom she intrusted the precious
                  gift, she felt a secret delight in throwing around the transfer, something of the
                  grandeur which awaited the future master of Mowbray Hall.</p>
               <p>Richard Morton stood beside Mr. Ashton, admiring the rare and exquisite adornments
                  of the brilliantly lighted drawing-room at Woodbine Lodge.</p>
               <p>"What a perfect taste Miss Mowbray has," at length he exclaimed; "ah, Mr. Ashton,
                  many an envious glance will be bestowed upon you to-night."</p>
               <p>"Yours, for instance," said Mr. Ashton with a peculiar smile.</p>
               <p>"No, thank Heaven, not mine," rejoined Richard; "my own happiness is too complete
                  for that; I should sooner think of being envied myself."</p>
               <p>"You have more reason to be envied than I, Morton."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to say, that while I agree with you there, I marvel much that
                     <emph>you</emph> should say so; but I suppose you think you can afford to
                  expend a little magnanimity on me," Richard laughingly replied.</p>
               <p>"However that may be," said Mr. Ashton in the same mood; "remember what I tell you
                  now,—you are the more to be envied to-night, because you will receive only what
                  you have nobly earned."</p>
               <p>"This way, gentlemen, if you please; the company<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000182"/> are beginning to come," said a servant, leading the
                  way to another room; "Mr. Morton, here is a note your lady wished me to hand to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Come to me, Richard; I must see you a few moments alone, before the
                     ceremony can take place.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Show me to Miss Singleton," said he to the servant, as his eye ran over and over
                  again those delicately written lines; "Mr. Ashton, you will excuse me for a few
                  moments, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said that gentleman with a look which, had Richard noticed it, would
                  have demanded an explanation.</p>
               <p>"She said you were to knock at that door," said the servant, retiring; "you will
                  find her there, I presume."</p>
               <p>Richard's gentle knock was answered in a voice scarcely audible, and in a moment
                  he stood in the presence of his betrothed. But his steps were arrested—the words
                  on his lips stayed—at the beautiful apparition before him. It was Maggie's
                  face,—the same soft, pleading eyes,—the same look of love with which she ever
                  welcomed him; but why in such regal attire?—why with a fortune more than he could
                  ever possess, flashing and gleaming over her, as though its brilliancy were but a
                  part of her lovely self?—what queen of fairies had assumed the form and features
                  of his beloved!</p>
               <p>"Richard!" she cried, approaching him and holding out her jewelled hand;—"Richard,
                  oh, what shall I say—forgive—forgive!"</p>
               <p>Her words recalled him,—"Maggie, dearest," said he, catching both her hands; "what
                  is all this! what am I to forgive!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive a deception, which has won for me a treasure of infinitely more worth
                  than all my father's possessions;" she replied in an agitated but sweet voice, and
                  with downcast eyes.</p>
               <p>"Your father's possessions!" he repeated with astonishment; "Maggie, darling, what
                     <emph>can</emph> you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Sit down here by me, Richard," said she, moving towards a chair; "and hear my
                  confession. This is a strange hour for such a task, is it not?" she continued,
                  while a deep carnation dyed her cheeks; "but I cannot become your wife, dear one,
                  till I have told you how I have deceived you—you, the soul of truth—how I appeared
                  before you in a character not my own. The bride you have wooed and won, Richard,
                  is not the poor friendless orphan she allowed you to believe. With the hand she
                  will proudly place in yours,—the heart she this night pledges you for ever,
                  LUCILLE MOWBRAY resigns her name and fortune to one all worthy the gift."</p>
               <p>"Am I dreaming!" cried Richard wildly; "what is this you have been saying,
                  dearest?"</p>
               <p>"That if you do not turn me from you, you will this night wed Lucille Mowbray, the
                  heiress!" she repeated with a sweet smile.</p>
               <p>"You the heiress!—my Maggie!"</p>
               <p>"Maggie no longer, but yours, Richard, if you will,<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000183"/> for ever, your own Lucille. May I hope for pardon
                  now?" she pleaded.</p>
               <p>"What have I to pardon?" said he tenderly. "If as you say—though I cannot realize
                  it,—you have concealed your name and fortune from me,—if you are really the
                  Mowbray heiress, your <emph>heart</emph> is still the same, and that is the prize
                  I sought."</p>
               <p>"Then I am forgiven," was her joyous cry.</p>
               <p>"If there is aught to forgive," he replied; "but tell me why you did this,
                  Maggie,—yes, let me call you so once more; I cannot so easily unlearn that dear
                  name."</p>
               <p>"Then 'Lucille' will not be as dear to you?" she added half reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"It will be even more precious when applied to <emph>my wife,</emph>" he fondly
                  answered; "now, Lucille, tell me why all this deception."</p>
               <p>"I wish it could be less harshly termed," said she; "and yet I know it is just.
                  Believe me, Richard, it was not so much to deceive others as to undeceive myself,
                  that prompted me to such a strange course. I had been flattered, courted, and
                  caressed, till my heart sickened and wearied of the false worship. Well I knew it
                  was Sir Charles Mowbray's daughter they sought, not my simple, loving heart.
                  Deeply I felt that thus must it ever be,—that the yearnings of my heart for a love
                  which could find its completeness in me, would never be satisfied. Then it was,
                  that, coming among those who had never known me, the thought—the burning desire
                  took possession of me, to test the value a selfish world would place upon a simple
                  maiden like myself, without fortune or friends. You know something of that test,
                  Richard, for you have seen the neglect—the contempt with which my humble position
                  has been favored, while my friend was surrounded with adulation."</p>
               <p>"But who is this friend? is she too an heiress?" Richard asked with a puzzled
                  look.</p>
               <p>"No, she has been my companion from a child; to her belongs the name by which you
                  have known me,—the <emph>real</emph> Maggie."</p>
               <p>"And Mr. Ashton—has he too been deceived?"</p>
               <p>"No; when I found that he loved Maggie, but would not woo <emph>the
                     heiress,</emph> I told him all."</p>
               <p>"Ah! now I understand why he said I was to be envied more than he; how like a
                  dream this all seems!"</p>
               <p>"Have I done wrong, Richard? does your pure heart condemn me? do I read aright in
                  your grave face, that our innocent ruse will end thus sadly?" Lucille asked with a
                  tearful eye.</p>
               <p>Richard gazed upon her a moment in silence, while his thoughts flew swiftly over
                  the past.</p>
               <p>"Condemn you!" he exclaimed; "never! If I look 'grave,' it is because I feel my
                  own unworthiness, Lucille—for now I can call you thus—you have borne a hero's
                  part; you have won a victory worthy the greatest conqueror on earth; you
                     <emph>should</emph> have received a reward commensurate with your deed."</p>
               <p>"Your approval is all the reward I desire," said she; "I feared—but away with
                  fears now—nothing but<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7276-00000184"/> joy is before me.
                  See, Richard; I dared not wear this significant orange wreath or bridal veil till
                  I had confessed to you. You are sure you will still receive me?—still remember
                  your promise to take charge of my estates?" she playfully added, holding aloft the
                  rich gossamer veil.</p>
               <p>"I understand it all now," he replied; "God help me to receive thee as I ought, my
                  bride—my wife;" then, impressing a gentle, reverent kiss upon her fair forehead,
                  he enveloped her blushing face in the gauzy folds.</p>
               <p>"Here, that isn't the way," exclaimed the laughing voice of Maggie, who had just
                  entered the room; "let me arrange it for you, Lucille, dear; they are awaiting us
                  below," she whispered as she bent over Lucille's face; "are you ready?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I have told him all," Lucille replied in the same tone; "I fear nothing
                  now."</p>
               <p>Fashion and beauty thronged the spacious rooms below;—gay city guests, drawn
                  thither by the eclat of the occasion, came in all their dazzling array, to pay
                  their homage to the English heiress. Strangers of distinction were there, who had
                  known Sir Charles Mowbray abroad, and now gladly graced the nuptials of his only
                  child; never gathered a more brilliant and aristocratic assembly beneath one roof.
                  From the conservatory, where were concealed a band of amateur performers, music
                  lent its enchantment to the scene—now sending forth its thrilling strains in the
                  soft notes of the harp—then swelling into a grand chorus of rich melody.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the music ceased—the low, murmuring hum of voices sank into a breathless
                  hush, as the bridal party was announced. First, in their simple vestal robes, came
                  three bridesmaids with their attendants; then at Lonny's side followed Nettie,
                  whose golden curls seemed resting on some fleecy cloud, so ethereal was her pure
                  white drapery. At any other time, her rare loveliness would have called forth a
                  burst of admiration; but now every eye was bent in eager anticipation upon the
                  open door. Elegantly attired in rich white satin, whose lustre was softened by an
                  airy covering; her raven hair setting off to advantage the orange flowers and
                  gracefully falling veil—the bride for whom they waited entered, leaning on Mr.
                  Ashton's arm. As they approached the circle around the clergyman, they parted, and
                  with deference waved those who followed them to the centre of the group.</p>
               <p>Paralyzed with astonishment, every gaze was riveted on the sweet face, around
                  which flashed such queenly gems. A union of such splendor and magnificence had
                  never before greeted their sight. It was as if an Eastern princess had suddenly
                  dropped among them in all her oriental grandeur. "What and who could she be!"
                  sprang to every lip; but the deep silence was unbroken, save by the solemn words
                  of the beautiful marriage service of the Church of England. Slowly and with deep
                  pathos were they uttered; but when the clergyman came to the words,—"Wilt thou,
                     Lucille<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7276-00000185"/> Mowbray, take this man to be
                  thy wedded husband?" Mr. Flint, who had been invited through courtesy to assist in
                  the ceremony, quickly sprang to his feet, and, touching his arm, whispered: "You
                  have made a mistake in the name, sir."</p>
               <p>"There is no mistake, I believe," replied the officiating gentleman, turning to
                  Richard Morton for confirmation.</p>
               <p>"You are right, sir; proceed, if you please," said Richard.</p>
               <p>Then it was that emotion could no longer be repressed. Scarcely was the remaining
                  service heeded; only once again, as those words were addressed to Mr. Ashton's
                  bride, did the excited listeners breathlessly pause;—then, as in answer to the
                  name of "Margaret Singleton," they heard her clear response, the truth flashed
                  upon them.</p>
               <p>It were difficult to describe the mingled emotions with which this astounding
                  revelation was received; nor was there much time for their exhibition; for, with
                  ready tact the company were at once ushered to the royal banquet which awaited
                  them; while the band poured forth its inspiring and loyal strains of "God save the
                  Queen."</p>
               <p>There, first assuming her rightful honors, Lucille proudly sat by her husband's
                  side. Many a glance of admiration paid homage to her resplendent loveliness—many a
                  downcast eye, too, told of deep chagrin and mortification.</p>
               <p>"Richard," said Judge Morton, approaching them, "I can wait no longer for an
                  explanation of this strange scene; what does it all mean, my son?"</p>
               <p>"It means, simply, that, instead of being Miss Mowbray's friend, my wife was Miss
                  Mowbray herself," Richard replied with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Have you known it all along, Richard?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, not till a few moments before the ceremony."</p>
               <p>"You will acknowledge now that a woman can keep a secret, will you not, father?"
                  Lucille asked, with a sweet emphasis on the last word.</p>
               <p>"I will acknowledge your power for any thing that is good and noble," he replied;
                  "but how could you deceive us so long,—particularly Richard?"</p>
               <p>"I will explain to you some time how and why I did it," said she; "here, Richard,
                  make room for Nettie, sweet girl."</p>
               <p>"So, after all, you were the rich Miss Mowbray!" exclaimed Nettie, kissing the
                  fair bride's cheek; "who would ever have thought of such a thing? I wish you could
                  hear all the stories I have, within ten minutes," she added, laughing heartily; "I
                  don't believe you could tell which was right yourself."</p>
               <p>"Probably none of them," Lucille replied; "motives so simple as mine would
                  scarcely be thought of here."</p>
               <p>"What were your motives? pray tell me; for I cannot guess."</p>
               <p>Ere Lucille could reply to Nettie's question, she was surrounded by flattering
                  homage. Meaningless<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7276-00000186"/> compliments and
                  congratulations fell upon her ear; but they found no lodgment there. Now and then
                  a merry smile would gleam around her mouth, at the discomfiture of former
                     <emph>friends;</emph> but her words were kind to all; malice or revenge could
                  have no part in happiness like hers. The least bit of the former, however, it must
                  be confessed, twinkled in her eye, as Mr. Flint approached her with a most
                  obsequious bow.</p>
               <p>"Allow me to congratulate you, Mrs. Morton," said he; "you have become quite a
                  heroine to-night."</p>
               <p>"Is it for <emph>that</emph> you would congratulate me?" she asked,
                  mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly," he replied; "your happy union, of course, I referred to; yet it is
                  no small honor to create such a sensation as you have done."</p>
               <p>"That depends, sir, upon the <emph>kind</emph> of sensation created."</p>
               <p>"Ahem! well,—I must say you managed the thing very adroitly," he stammered; "you
                  must have had some powerful motive for doing it. Mr. Morton, you were in the
                  secret, of course; cannot you enlighten us upon the subject?"</p>
               <p>"Allow me to answer for him, sir," said Lucille, proudly; "it is only within the
                  last two hours, that the 'poor dependant'—the 'humble companion' he would have
                  exalted to himself, has been revealed to him as a disguised heiress."</p>
               <p>"Allow me, also to add, that the motives that prompted such a ruse are worthy of
                  being engraven in gold," Richard Morton quickly rejoined.</p>
               <p>"No doubt—no doubt," said Mr. Flint; "I have always remarked an unusual degree of
                  excellence about your wife; but I have really quite a curiosity to hear what they
                  were."</p>
               <p>"In a word, then, sir, she wished to estimate the value you, and all others who
                  make up the world, would place upon her, independent of her fortune."</p>
               <p>"Ahem—well—Mrs. Morton, what is the result of your original idea—for it is
                  certainly an original one," Mr. Flint asked, rather uneasily.</p>
               <p>"Perfectly satisfactory, sir, though somewhat <emph>humbling</emph> to myself, I
                  must confess," she replied, in a manner which did not tend to lessen his
                  uneasiness.</p>
               <p>"But you have made many friends," said he, looking around the rooms.</p>
               <p>"Some noble ones," she replied; "but you do not suppose, Mr. Flint, that these are
                  all my friends—or rather <emph>were,</emph>" she added, significantly.</p>
               <p>"I do not know how any one can be otherwise," he replied in an insinuating tone,
                  just as they were summoned back to the drawing-rooms.</p>
               <p>"We must not forget Miss Priscilla and her charge," Lucille whispered to her
                  friend; "come, Maggie, let us go and see them."</p>
               <p>The astonishing disclosure, which had created such a sensation in the
                  drawing-rooms, had been thoroughly discussed in the servants' hall, where Miss
                  Priscilla held undisputed sway over the appetites and opinions of a large number
                  of poor neighbors, who had been invited to celebrate the occasion by a grand
                  supper.</p>
               <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7276-00000187"/>
               <p>"It's my opinion, decided," said Miss Priscilla, whose words were listened to with
                  profound respect since she had risen to the honor of housekeeper; "it's my
                  opinion, and there ain't no getting away from it neither, you never can tell what
                  a person is by their money; there's some that's rich, that are good, and there's
                  some that aint, that's jest as good; and so agin t'other way: some poor folks is
                  good, and some aint;—it's all in their nat'ral disposition, arter all. Now I hold
                  that them young ladies aint no better nor worse than they was afore, whichever way
                  the fortin goes. For my part, I think 'em both as near like angels as they can
                  be."</p>
               <p>"So do I"—"so do I," was nodded around the circle in assent to Miss Priscilla's
                  remarks.</p>
               <p>Then from one and another came tales of distress relieved by the "sweet young
                  lady;" how with her own hands she had ministered to them—and she all the while a
                  grand heiress;—this never-ending theme was brought to a sudden termination by the
                  appearance of the lady herself and her friend in their bridal garments. An
                  involuntary burst of wonder and delight greeted their entrance, which Lucille
                  acknowledged with a sweet smile as she bade them "good evening."</p>
               <p>"How are you enjoying yourselves here, Miss Priscilla?" said she, turning to that
                  worthy.</p>
               <p>"They all seem to be real happy," Miss Priscilla replied; "but we can't talk of
                  nothin' but you and the other lady."</p>
               <p>"You are surprised, of course, to find that we have changed names," said Lucille,
                  smiling: "but I hope that doesn't change our characters; my friend deserves all
                  the respect you have shown her."</p>
               <p>"And you deserve to be sainted," chimed in Priscilla.</p>
               <p>"No more than before," Lucille answered earnestly; "but I suppose we cannot be
                  spared from the company long; so we must talk fast. I should like to take you each
                  by the hand, and thank you all for the respect and kindness you have shown me,"
                  she added, glancing around the room; "be assured I shall never forget you; and,
                  when I return again to this country, shall hope to see you all again. Miss
                  Priscilla, you will please distribute my gifts among these good people, which I
                  hope they will accept, bearing in mind this truth, which I have found by
                  experience,—that poverty can become a blessing or curse, as our hearts incline;
                  and that what the world may think of us affects us not in the sight of God."</p>
               <p>"What's that she said last?" cried an old lady after Lucille had gone.</p>
               <p>"She said 'twan't no matter how the world treated us, if we're all right with
                  God," Miss Priscilla replied, wiping her eye; "and so 'taint. But if you'd a known
                  as well as I how <emph>she's</emph> been treated, you couldn't a heerd her say it
                  without crying. I shall tell Mr. Flint a piece o' my mind yet about that. Now look
                  here; see what she's left for each on you. Nobody need'nt tell me folks aint never
                  perfect in this world; I know better—I've seen 'em."</p>

               <p>Happier hearts or brighter faces went not forth from Woodbine Lodge that night,

               <p>"THIS world is full of wonders," said Uncle Joseph the next morning at Willow
                  Glen; "I don't see why writers need to <emph>make up</emph> stories, when such
                  strange things are happening every day."</p>
               <p>"It is a trite saying, but I think we all have reason to believe it, that 'truth
                  is stranger than fiction,'" replied his brother Mark.</p>
               <p>"That scene last night, for instance," Uncle Joseph rejoined; "how I should like
                  to see it all written out."</p>
               <p>"That could scarcely be done," said Charlotte Thornton, laughing; "who could
                  describe the utter amazement which sat upon every face, as the truth burst upon
                  them,—gradually changing into an expression of sincere joy on some, and the
                  deepest chagrin and mortification on others? You, for one, Joseph, looked so<pb
                     n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7276-00000189"/> queer when the clergyman called her
                  Lucille Mowbray, and she assented!—what was that you whispered to Mr. Flint
                  then?"</p>
               <p>"I only said that that trap was pretty well sprung, and I pitied any body that had
                  got caught in it; but he looked as if he'd bite me. 'What trap do you mean?' said
                  he. I saw in a minute that he took, but I didn't care. 'I mean,' said I, 'that
                  those who have been looking down so long upon her, will have to <emph>look</emph>
                  higher than they can <emph>reach</emph> now.'"</p>
               <p>"What did he say to that?"</p>
               <p>"He didn't make any reply, but went to talking with the clergyman, asking him ever
                  so many questions about her."</p>
               <p>"There were several English people present, who were exceedingly amused at the
                  ruse," said Mr. Thornton; "one gentleman told me he should make it the subject of
                  a newspaper article when he got home—giving us, I suppose, a fine setting off for
                  our treatment of one of their aristocracy."</p>
               <p>"He must make exceptions, if he writes truthfully," said Mark; "I believe she has
                  been quite a favorite of yours, Lottie."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but no more so, I think, than her friend, now Mrs. Ashton," said Mrs.
                  Thornton; "I admire them both."</p>
               <p>"I felt more joy last night, on Richard Morton's account than any other," Mr.
                  Thornton remarked; "he has borne himself so nobly through all his misfortunes,—has
                  shown such a pure and upright heart in every trial, that he well deserves his
                  brilliant destiny."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact," said Uncle Joseph; "but there were some there last night who
                  didn't seem to think so; they said he was a sly fox—that he'd known all along what
                  he was after."</p>
               <p>"It is false, to my certain knowledge," Melville Thornton exclaimed, indignantly;
                  "it provokes me to see how few people can witness another's prosperity without
                  trying to detract from it. Richard believed her to be a poor girl till a few
                  moments before they were married."</p>
               <p>"He has found his unknown benefactor now, hasn't he?" said Charlotte Thornton.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I thought of that in a moment last night," her husband replied: "how
                  perfectly she has carried the whole thing through!"</p>
               <p>"The best part of the fun was in the servants' hall," said Uncle Joseph, laughing;
                  "I happened to go in there just after Mr. Flint did, and such a time as that Miss
                  Page had with him I never did see before. He turned all sorts of colors, and tried
                  all sorts of ways to get away from her, but 't was no go—she would have her say,
                  till finally he had to clear out from the room."</p>
               <p>"She is pretty hard upon him sometimes, and keen too," Mrs. Thornton replied; "did
                  you hear any thing she said?"</p>
               <p>"I heard her ask him what he thought about the charity seeker now; but I couldn't
                  hear what he said;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7276-00000190"/> I saw him turn very
                  red in the face though; that was when he went out of the room."</p>
               <p>"I presume she had heard him use those words about Richard Morton's wife; he
                  always treated her very coolly; what a sad thing it is for a minister to be so
                  devoted to the world!"</p>
               <p>"Let us hope there are not many of them," added Mr. Thornton, earnestly; "Mr.
                  Flint's is a rare case, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Being an exception, it is more noticeable," his wife rejoined; "only think what a
                  change a godly minister would make in this place!"</p>
               <p>"True; but that responsibility rests not with us," said her husband, smiling;
                  "fortunately, we have none but our own duties to perform."</p>
               <p>"Lottie knows how to do them," said Uncle Joseph; "she's her mother all over
                  again."</p>
               <p>"She has that mother's testimony ever before her," said Mark, pointing to the
                  mantel.</p>
               <p>"So have we," replied Joseph, "if we haven't lost our memory; but somehow,
                  goodness always seemed to come natural to mother, and Lottie too."</p>
               <p>"Who has more cause for gratitude to them both than I?" exclaimed Mr. Thornton.
                  "In leaving her children that legacy, your blessed mother enriched me more than
                  you all, for it preserved and restored to me a treasure I might else have never
                  found, or if found it might have been dimmed by sin and crime. Then, too, that
                  legacy has given me a living example of a perfection which a strict adherence to
                  its precepts will bring,— has bestowed upon me a heart which, though ever keenly
                  alive to humanity's call, still pulsates with a deep and pure affection,—a
                  wife-like trust."</p>
               <p>"Well, for my part," said Uncle Joseph, deeply affected, "I never thought Lottie
                  would find any body half good enough for her; but I believe she's got her match
                  now. How strange though, that the boy she took such care of, should have turned
                  out to be yours—her husband's."</p>
               <p>"The boy <emph>you</emph> took such care of, you mean," said Charlotte Thornton;
                  "what would he have been without you, Joseph?"</p>
               <p>"I shouldn't have heard of him if it hadn't been for you, Lottie; but bless his
                  heart, he's done me more good than I ever did him."</p>
               <p>"We all have a claim upon him," said Mr. Thornton, smiling; "we ought to call him
                     <emph>our</emph> 'Golden Legacy.'"</p>
               <p>"Capital!" cried Unele Joseph; "he's better than gold though; but Mark is going to
                  get him after all, it seems."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have a loadstone sufficiently powerful to draw even your treasure away,"
                  Mark Atherton replied with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't wonder,—Nettie is such a darling," said Uncle Joseph; "when will
                  their wedding be, Mark?"</p>
               <p>"I told Lonny it should be early in the spring; what do you say, Mr.
                  Thornton?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly do not wish to delay making such a<pb n="372-373"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000191"/> daughter mine," he replied; "and I know my wife
                  longs to give the child of her heart a <emph>mother's</emph> blessing."</p>
               <p>"How little did I ever dream of the possibility of Nettie's playful, childish
                  appellation ever becoming a reality!" exclaimed Charlotte Thornton; "she is dear
                  to me as an own child; I could not ask for more earthly happiness than to see her
                  and Lonny united."</p>
               <p>During this conversation in the cheerful sittin-groom at Willow Glen, Lonny and
                  Nettie were holding another of a very different character in an adjoining room.
                  What had been said we can only gather from her concluding words:—</p>
               <p>"Then you do not disapprove of my going, Lonny," she added eagerly; "you do not
                  think I am foolish."</p>
               <p>"No, I do not disapprove of it, Nettie dear, because I know that you are guided by
                  the purest motives; but I have no hope of your success,—on the contrary, I fear
                  the injury to your feelings in the reception I am confident you will meet."</p>
               <p>"She could not treat me rudely, Lonny; I will pray her so earnestly to seek a
                  reconciliation with father,—to return to him and strive to make his life happy,—to
                  cast aside all those foolish prejudices, and come back to her home, where she will
                  be received kindly and with affection if she will allow it,—I will plead with her
                  so hard—she cannot say me nay; above all, she cannot turn coldly away."</p>
               <p>"I could almost believe you, sweet enthusiast, did I not know her with whom you
                  have to deal. I will not venture you there alone; I will accompany you."</p>
               <p>"That will be so nice; only I must see her first alone."</p>
               <p>"Your father must not know of this visit until it is over; and not then, if it
                  prove as I predict," said Lonny.</p>
               <p>"She cannot refuse me—she will return, and make us all happy yet," Nettie
                  exclaimed, as they rejoined their friends in the sitting-room.</p>
               <p>Some two weeks afterwards, Nettie, clinging nervously to her lover's arm, entered
                  a sombre-looking, aristocratic city mansion, and in a trembling voice inquired for
                  Mrs. Mark Atherton. The dark forbidding aspect of the house did not serve to
                  lighten her fears, and it was with an agitation she could scarcely control, that
                  she followed the servant to her mother's presence.</p>
               <p>"I will remain here," whispered Lonny, seating himself in the parlor; "remember,
                  darling, you have a protector near."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Atherton had chosen this retreat, when she left her husband's home, as better
                  suited to her pride and station than any other she could command. It was an old
                  Manning estate, occupied only by two maiden sisters of that name—distant relatives
                  of Mrs. Atherton. They had known but little of the circumstances attending her
                  separation from her family, and being lonely, they were quite willing to receive
                  her without much questioning. "What Manning was ever in fault?" they thought, and
                  so Mr. Atherton was set down in their minds at once, as some monster in human
                  form.</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7276-00000192"/>
               <p>Here Mrs. Atherton had spent the last few months—we will not say pleasantly, or
                  comfortably, or easily, for it was none of these; but here she had stayed,
                  unnoticed by the world without, though eagerly watching from her retreat, every
                  occurrence in that still loved world. The strange revelation at the double wedding
                  at Woodbine Lodge, had not escaped her knowledge, and the train of remembrances it
                  awoke maddened her almost to frenzy. She had heard, too, of Nettie's betrothal to
                  the hated child of Melville Thornton, and her beautiful appearance as Miss
                  Mowbray's first bridesmaid. In her solitude she had preyed upon all these
                  things—every scene in her life had been lived over again; especially that
                  awful—that horrible night, which still hung its heavy curse over her. She
                  remembered too Lonny's prophetic declaration, that the day would come when her
                  words would pain her far more than they did him; and she acknowledged—to her own
                  heart only—that she had suffered far more in her bitterness towards him, than he
                  had ever done. But strange to say, these hours of thought, these sad
                  recollections, had only hardened her heart against her own flesh and blood. She
                  had half expected some overtures from her husband, and gloried in the thought of
                  the triumphant disdain with which she would reject them; but still she was
                  miserable,—forsaken alike of God and man. She had "sown to the wind," and of "the
                  whirlwind" must she reap.</p>
               <p>Nettie's timid knock at the door, so different from the servant's who usually
                  attended upon her, caused Mrs. Atherton to unclose it herself, and there, face to
                  face, mother and daughter stood for an instant,—but it was only an instant ere
                  Nettie had thrown her arms about the astonished woman, and was pouring forth the
                  burden of her mission. One moment more and Mrs. Atherton had withdrawn from that
                  sweet embrace, and stood with her cold eye fixed upon her pleading daughter. Not a
                  word had been spoken—no emotion was visible on her stern face, as she stood
                  quietly listening till Nettie ceased. Then, as from her silence the dear girl took
                  courage and again threw her arms about her, exclaiming,—"You <emph>will</emph>
                  come back, dear mother, I know you will, and become a comfort to my father," she
                  dashed those delicate arms from her with violence, and in the same cold sneering
                  tones as of old, spoke,—</p>
               <p>"Have you done, miss? are you sure you said your lesson correctly—just as your
                  father taught you? because if you have, I have but one answer to give you."</p>
               <p>"Father does not know—indeed he does not, that I came here," Nettie cried; "I
                  could not bear to think of you, my mother, so desolate and lonely—away from
                  home."</p>
               <p>"Waste no more such thoughts upon me; I am no longer your mother; I disown you; I
                  cur—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop!" shrieked Nettie; "you shall not say that; any thing else, but not a
                  mother's curse upon me."</p>
               <p>"Begone then," cried the infuriated woman; "never let me see your baby face again;
                  I hate your father and every body else that belongs to you; begone then, or I
                  shall cur—"</p>
               <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7276-00000193"/>
               <p>Nettie closed the door upon the last word, and quickly hastening to Lonny, took
                  his arm, with a simple "Let us go now,—you were right; but I have done my duty;"
                  and they left the miserable woman to her meditations.</p>
               <p>Could they have glanced back into that room, even Lonny's strong heart would have
                  recoiled at the sight; for there, with the step and wild laugh of a maniac, Mrs.
                  Atherton strode about, her hair falling in loose gray masses over her shoulders as
                  it escaped from the cap she tore off from her head. Now with curses, threats and
                  imprecations, she filled the air, as reason left its throne, and passion reigned
                  triumphant there. Thus must her wretched life be passed, for she has rudely cast
                  aside the <emph>last</emph> gem which lay in her path—a daughter's love!</p>

               <p>WITH the first warm breath of Spring—the first glad song which burst from its
                  feathered heralds, Lonny led his bride to the altar. It was a quiet family party
                  which assembled at Mark Atherton's, to witness the solemn, yet joyful
                  consummation; for their misfortunes were still too recent—the disgrace too keenly
                  felt, to admit the curious, prying eyes of neighbors and friends to their home.
                  From Daisyside and Willow Glen the happy guests had come, joined too by Mr.
                  Selwyn, who had become endeared to them all by his magnanimous devotion to the
                  beautiful bride. He it was who had clasped that bracelet of diamonds around her
                  snowy arm—had thrown a necklace of the same precious gems about her throat, and
                  with a few whispered words, which reached no ear save hers, had placed in her hand
                  the munificent marriage settlement he had destined for her,<pb n="378-379"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000194"/> as his bride. Nettie received his gift in silence,
                  for how meagre would all words have seemed, to express the deep veneration with
                  which his noble conduct had inspired her!—how meagre to him, in comparison with
                  the warm, eloquent look with which she raised her speaking eyes to his.</p>
               <p>"That makes me almost ashamed of my present," said Uncle Joseph, when he
                  comprehended the extent of Mr. Selwyn's generosity; "but it's all I've got, Lonny;
                  and if it was a thousand times as large, you would be just as welcome, my dear
                  boy;"—saying which, he handed him a deed of Daisyside and its acres, retaining
                  only a life-lease for himself and wife.</p>
               <p>"Just like you, noblest of men!" exclaimed Lonny, with deep emotion; "after
                  filling my cup to overflowing with kindness and devotion, thus to give me your
                  all! But, indeed, I cannot accept it. Daisyside shall own no other master, while I
                  live, than he who has made it proverbially a refuge from want and sorrow."</p>
               <p>"But we shall live there, you know, Lonny," urged Uncle Joseph, and we always
                  calculated it was yours; only we thought that, when you were married, you would
                  surely bring your wife to stay with us. But Mark needs you more than we do; so we
                  can't say any more about that. Now, Lonny boy, <emph>do</emph> take this; Henny
                  and I both want you to."</p>
               <p>"No, Uncle Joseph, I cannot, though I dearly prize the beloved home which
                  sheltered my friendless orphanage. But more dearly do I prize the love which has
                  prompted your noble offer."</p>
               <p>"The gift I bring you, dear children," said Aunt Lottie, "is not worldly
                  independence, such as Mr. Selwyn's munificence has provided for you; nor, like my
                  generous brother's, is it all I possess: but it is the most precious of all my
                  earthly treasures. To you, dear Lonny, it is the golden chain which has drawn you
                  to your father's side; to you both—to us all, it may prove the bright link which
                  will unite us at last to her, of whose life it is but an epitome, and whose
                  glorious death was its sure reward. To no other would I commit this sacred trust,"
                  continued Aunt Lottie, placing the gift into their united hands; "but I would have
                  the blessed remembrance descend from mother to child through many generations, as
                  a legacy of far more worth than all earth's treasures combined. As my mother, with
                  her dying breath, counselled me to make this the rule of my life, so, with her
                  gift, would I waft her words to your hearts. Be more faithful to the trust than I
                  have been, dear children, that this 'legacy,' brightened by your example, may
                  become a beacon to the world around you."</p>
               <p>"Don't discourage the poor things, Lottie, by telling them they must be better
                  than you are," said Uncle Joseph, wiping his eye; "nobody can do that; but Lonny
                  and Nettie'll be as good as any body, I'll venture. Come, let's go down now; the
                  minister's waiting, and Mark won't know what to make of it. Here, Henny, we'll go
                  right behind Lottie and her husband."</p>
               <p>Lonny's eventful life received its crown of blessings,<pb n="380-381"
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000195"/> as Mark Atherton placed in <emph>his</emph> hand
                     <emph>hers</emph> who had been the little mediator of his boyhood trials—the
                  idol of his later years—the prize for which he had so long prayed and striven. In
                  that solemn hour, when the holy man of God evoked a blessing upon this heaven-born
                  union, who can doubt that a <emph>mother's</emph> spirit hovered over this loving
                  group?—that, as she gazed, unseen, upon these children of her love, and read, in
                  the high and noble purposes which stirred their hearts, the fulfilment of her
                  prayers—the faithful remembrance of her "legacy," a louder note of joy swelled her
                  unceasing song of gratitude and praise!</p>
               <p>Around this happy household hearth, where increasing love and joy mark each year's
                  course;—where, loved and honored, he who once from door to door begged the small
                  pittance for himself and "gran'ther," lives on his pure and upright life, blessed
                  himself in blessing others, aided ever by the sweet, golden-haired angel of his
                  youthful dreams;—where, but for memory's dark phantoms, which now and then cross
                  his path, Mark Atherton still leads a happy and useful life, would we love to
                  linger long.</p>
               <p>To Daisyside, whose yearly jubilees still send forth their joyous streams 'mongst
                  thirsty souls;—whose noble master, as along life's decline he slowly moves,—the
                  gentle, faithful, loving Henrietta at his side,—still yearns to soften human woe,
                  to smooth the rugged paths of poverty and want;—whose light, set upon a hill,
                  shines through all the region round, alluring thither the friendless, homeless,
                  helpless ones,—to Daisyside, "the orphan's home,"—to the cheerful, genial,
                  benevolent face of Joseph Atherton, we would ever turn with fresh delight.</p>
               <p>And Willow Glen—that quiet retreat of all that is pure and holy in man's
                  nature;—that home of charity, whose sylvan bowers seem peopled with angel
                  life;—whose ever-flowing tide wafts back its freight of prayers and
                  blessings;—whose green branches still wave and nod with Heaven's approval;—where
                  could we find rest, if not with thee!—where else seek for one on earth, whose
                  gentle, heavenly mission makes such near approach to our "Great Exemplar," as Aunt
                  Lottie?</p>
               <p>Over ocean's trackless path, too, would we follow with joy the steps of those,
                  whose life-lessons will ne'er be forgotten, though pomp and splendor ever surround
                  them;—of Richard Morton, the honored master of Mowbray Hall;—of Lucille, who
                  watches, with proud and happy eye, the superiority every where conceded to her
                  noble husband;—of Mr. Ashton, whose "delusion" increases by daily companionship
                  with his beloved wife;—of all those who have been taught, by a simple ruse, the
                  only test of worth.</p>
               <p>Even on the darker shades of the picture,—into the lonely room where, in alternate
                  ravings and flashes of reason, the once proud and haughty Mrs. Atherton wears away
                  her wretched life;—into that sanctum where still, with hardened heart, and eye
                  undimmed for gold, <emph>he</emph> sits, whose humble calling has merged into a
                  "larger sphere of usefulness;" and who now speaks<pb n="382-383 (Advertisement) "
                     xml:id="VAC7276-00000196"/> to the world with a "trumpet-tongue;"—"flinty"
                  still, and filled with mammon;—upon these dark shades we might dwell, more with
                  profit than pleasure. But our "story" is told—our mission completed—the
                  evervarying "phases" of life caught as we passed along.</p>
