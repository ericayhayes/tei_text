old concerge looking through'thewicket after&#xD;
him as he rapidly moved away 'in the direc-&#xD;

courteously, calling me each time 'Moin&#xD;
qieur Concierge, when these canaille bour-&#xD;
geoise, can give me no'eother appellation than&#xD;
plain 'Potier,' as if the porter to the man-&#xD;
sion of so noble a. person as M. Noel was not&#xD;
better than a coinmon partier, who, it may be,&#xD;
cleans bobts or peddles oranges and' cigars&#xD;
through his wicket, degrading his office. It&#xD;
becomes us citizens of.the old eime to see&#xD;
that this office be kept in its dignity. What&#xD;

Spaniard who once6r twice came here with&#xD;

The person in the black crape visor kept&#xD;
on his way in the direction of Rue Sainte&#xD;
Louis: and as he approached the glare of&#xD;
lights that issued from the cabarets and cafe&#xD;
saloons in the neighborhood, -he drew his&#xD;
capote closer about the lower part ofhis face,&#xD;
as if not wholly trusting for thorough dis.&#xD;
guise to his mask. A merry pageant that had&#xD;
just passed up Rue Toulouse with a band of'&#xD;
music had' drawn all the idlers from the lonjas&#xD;
and doors of' the wine-shops in its train.-&#xD;

5ainto Louis to-night? asked the female.&#xD;
Jerome Jacot was a good-looking bour-&#xD;
Noise of eight and -twenty, with a toerable&#xD;
erson, and a tolerable share of admiration&#xD;
or it, as his well-trimmed and scented mus-&#xD;
ache, and trim whiskers anud locks bore tes-&#xD;
imony. Next to self admiration comes ad-&#xD;
miration for the fairer portion of creation.&#xD;
erome loved to gaze on the sparkling faces&#xD;
)f the beautiful dark eyed Creoles that pass-&#xD;
d him as he stood on guard, and think of&#xD;
matrimony. He always had a smile and a&#xD;
pleasant 'bon soir,' or 'bon jour,.madamoi-&#xD;
elle,' for every one of his own class.&#xD;
'It is like coming up to a-masked battery,&#xD;
madamoiselle, to talk with a lady who hides&#xD;
her -eyes with a veil,' said Jerome with gal-&#xD;
antry.&#xD;
'Will you answer me, gendarme, if I&#xD;
will lift the veil? asked the .same mellow&#xD;
tones.'&#xD;
' Yes; and, if I could, if your face prove&#xD;
as beautiful above your nose as 'below it, I&#xD;
would try to get you in, ma belle fille '.&#xD;
The young girl slowly, very slowly rais-&#xD;
ed her veil laughing in a low, half suppressed&#xD;
musical tone as she did so. I&#xD;
' Oiel'R exclaimed the gendarme step-&#xD;
ping back with an expression between fear&#xD;
and laughter.   -&#xD;
Now your promise, monsieur'&#xD;
'Sacre! I did not expect to, see a hid-&#xD;
eous negro's mask under the veil,' he an-&#xD;
swered in a. tone of disappointment. 'But,&#xD;
I will do as I promised. .Misericorde! but&#xD;
what a mixture of devil and angel, light and&#xD;
darkness in your face !I will wager that&#xD;
there is something better behind that half-&#xD;
mask.'&#xD;
'I dont take bets, monsieur gendarme,'&#xD;
she said dropping her veil again over the&#xD;
black visor. 'But I will help you make out&#xD;
your stakes when you next bet at roulette in&#xD;
the cafe over the way.'&#xD;
'I never bet at roulette, madamoiselle.&#xD;
I always lose by the rouge if I bet on the noir&#xD;
and then if I bet on the rouge the noir al-&#xD;
ways wins! I never hit it but once right in&#xD;
my life. I always bet at faro, madamoi-&#xD;
selle.'&#xD;
' There is a stake then for your next game,&#xD;
gendarme,' said the young girl dropping into&#xD;
his hand a five fran c piece.  . .   -&#xD;
' Courage, .Tacot. Ha, luck is with yrou&#xD;
&#xD;
to-night! Well, what must I1 do for this, m&#xD;
belle bourgeoise' he asked balaneing thn&#xD;
coin on the plimmel of 'his sword.1&#xD;
' You ainst tell me first how the guests ob&#xD;
tain admittance into the salon to the masque&#xD;
rade?' .&#xD;
'By tickets for which they pay two eagles.&#xD;
'You must get nde a ticket,'she said in a&#xD;
tone that was very determined.,&#xD;
impossible, ma filue,' answered the gens.&#xD;
darme with a look of surprise. 'It is a pri&#xD;
vate aristocraticaffair. A poor devil gen&#xD;
d ame has nothing to do in a matter 'likc&#xD;
this.. It is'nt like a masked dance in Ruc&#xD;
San Felipe!'1&#xD;
' The tickets are delivered at the door?'&#xD;
Yes, mademoiselle."&#xD;
'And taken by an officer of the gens&#xD;

'Yes, ma belle masque negre.'&#xD;
'He will deposit them somewhere. You&#xD;
must find out where--in somebox or recep.&#xD;
tacle by him, perhaps, after you are re-&#xD;
lieved from guard, which will be at eightI&#xD;
suppose.'       I&#xD;
'OUi, madamoiselle.'&#xD;
'1 want you to find your way, on any pre.&#xD;
tence, to the place where the tickets are de.&#xD;
posited and 'obtain one for me.'&#xD;
'It is as inuch as my head is worth,' answer.&#xD;
ed 'Jacot, shaking the member he named&#xD;
with great seriousness.&#xD;
'Nevertheless you ,mnust make the attempt.&#xD;
Here are three eagles Two of them  are to&#xD;
pay you ,for the ticket and one for yourself.'&#xD;
bMon Dieud what sins have I done to day&#xD;
above common, that the devil is rewarding&#xD;
me by tempting moin this fashion with gold.'&#xD;
If you 'are conscientious, you can deposite&#xD;
the two eagles when you take out the' tickets'&#xD;
'Bidh! I will think'of it! I will see what&#xD;
I can do madamniselle."&#xD;
'You'can succeedif you will,' Jacot. The&#xD;

'Yes-and I know you are both honest and&#xD;

'You do. know me. -At eight, I am off&#xD;

Iitret, with a crimson cdrtain dropped before&#xD;
it froin the ceiling to the floor through whieh&#xD;
came a rich glowas if froma lightwith in. She&#xD;
turned alkey'in the door and entered. The&#xD;
apartment presented a singular'contrast to the&#xD;
rough and mouldy exterior of the steep-roofed&#xD;
f edifice. It was spacious, and furnished qpM&#xD;
i that luxury which so often strikes the eyb 'of&#xD;
the passenger through the half-opened doors&#xD;
of similar structures as he wanders thrimkh&#xD;
the streets of the French Municipality. The&#xD;
two tall windows as well as the door, were&#xD;
hung with long crimson curtains relieved by&#xD;
muslin drapery with deep worked borders..&#xD;
A French couch, partly hid by'a screen stocd&#xD;
at the back of the room, and a sofa, and al&#xD;
handsome buffet, glittering with silver 'and&#xD;
glass, were -on the side. Articles of luxury&#xD;
were placed about the room as ornaments,&#xD;
ard oVer the mantle was a' shrine ofthle Ma-&#xD;
donria before which burned a wax candle, time&#xD;
only light in the room; but by the soft rich&#xD;
glow of which, reflected floin the crimson&#xD;
curtains, all these objects were distinctly vis-&#xD;
ible.&#xD;
She had opened the door softly ind closed&#xD;
it in the same manner like one who would niot&#xD;
be heard. She then went towards the door&#xD;
which communicated with'the adjoining apart-&#xD;
ment, saying,&#xD;
' I can tell if Louis has come through by&#xD;
the fold in the curtain. Yes,' she said with a&#xD;
look of alarm! 'The fold is ot as I left it!&#xD;
He has been in and missed me! Well I will&#xD;
tell 'him I only ran out to look at a carnivat&#xD;
procession. ,He has left the door ajar, too!&#xD;
Hark! there are voices within ! I must lis.&#xD;
ten. It is' Benito's voice and that of a stran-&#xD;
ger. Let me :see better. There! I have&#xD;
opened it a little more.' -They are so busy&#xD;
they did not hear me. What can they be&#xD;
talking about? I can see the stranger's figi&#xD;
ure. It is he who  saw ge intd the cabaret&#xD;
Perhaps it was Behito who cane into the room&#xD;
to see if any body was here.'&#xD;
She *as right., Benito on entering'the oth-&#xD;
er apartenent had said to his guest,&#xD;
' If you deSite that which'you have to say&#xD;
should be private, senor, I will just step in&#xD;
this roon to see if any' one is here. ' It iS Oc-&#xD;
cupied by my lodgers.&#xD;
'1 wiSh 'the strictest privacy, Benito,'~an-&#xD;
swered Don Rafael.&#xD;
' Bueno'!' answered Benito. 'I will then&#xD;
look out, agrainit one pair'br female ears over.&#xD;
hearing von, and send them away if I can.'&#xD;
And the beformned with a low toned laugh aps&#xD;
proachea the door and rapped. Hearing no&#xD;
response he opened it And 'peeped into the&#xD;
room.' All was quiet. The wax candle burn'&#xD;
ed before the Madonna, and all was still. He&#xD;
entered and looked carefully round and satis-&#xD;
fied hiinself 'that theloccupant was absent.&#xD;
'There is no danger, senor. Madame Louis-&#xD;
ette istout. .I rill, however,; leave tme door&#xD;

-Now, senor Don Rafael, what good news s&#xD;
has given me the honor of this visit.: It is a v&#xD;
long time since we met.'    I -I        .&#xD;
' It is no good news,' answered the Span- n&#xD;
iard. 'Benit~o, I need your services in a matter&#xD;
of deeper moment to me than you can con- a&#xD;
eive.'                    .r.&#xD;
'Love ?' repeated the maitre de cabaret.  l&#xD;
' Yes in plain words, love.' -&#xD;
'How can I serve you?'                 l&#xD;
Listen !'&#xD;
(' Yes, I will listen,' said Lousiette to her- &#xD;
self, who had entered her room unheard and f&#xD;
at this moment was looking upon them through&#xD;
the partly open door, her form hid by, the cur- t&#xD;
tain before it.]&#xD;
What she listened to will not be necessary f&#xD;
to reveal here. The conversation .continued a&#xD;
for full half an hour and at times, on the part t&#xD;
of the Spaniard, was loud and warm. At t&#xD;
length they both rose and Benito let his visit- t&#xD;
or forth by the door that opened upon the:&#xD;
street. At the same moment Louisette made&#xD;
a noise of opening and closing her own door&#xD;
as if just conie in, a noise wihch effectually&#xD;
deceived Benito.t&#xD;
'Ah, bueno! Madamoiselle Louisette has&#xD;
kept abroad just long enough,' he added as he 4&#xD;
heard'her. 'She would have heard a capitalI&#xD;
secret with her two ears if she had been all&#xD;
the while in the next room even with the doorI&#xD;
shut and the curtain down; for Don Rafael is&#xD;
not gifted with the softest voice, especially&#xD;
when he is excited. Ah, this is a rare matter,'&#xD;
he added as helocked the door after bidding&#xD;
his guest 'IBuenas, Noches.' This -is a rare&#xD;
affair,[Iand I have given , Don Rafael a spice of&#xD;
wisdom that will effect his object as well as&#xD;
stilettoes. I am tired of using steel. Nature&#xD;
has given me a bounteous head and 1 will use&#xD;
it instead. I will put my wits against other&#xD;
villains poignards! Don iafael at first thought&#xD;
n )thing could be done without a dagger. Wit&#xD;
is sharper than a stiletto.. Ah, Madamoiselle&#xD;
Louisette, there you are peeping in. Do you&#xD;
fall in love with my handsome head. You&#xD;
see I have no need to go to the expense of&#xD;
a mask at carnival!    Nature, hath been&#xD;
kind-'&#xD;
' Ai, Monsieur.Benito,' said Lonisette, I&#xD;
ami glad to see you so good-natured to night.&#xD;
You are usually so very savage.'. She spoke&#xD;
playfully. But the Deformed's good humor&#xD;
was not 'long lived,' and he allowed no one&#xD;
but himself to make jesting allusions to his&#xD;
personal aspect. He would allude to his hid-&#xD;
eousness himself and seem to mak" %t and&#xD;
mirth of it; but it was from a mnvbed prinei.&#xD;
ple of self-defence, lest others should fore.&#xD;
stall him and make him their jest. The Span-&#xD;
iard had left a purse heavy with gold in his&#xD;
hand and this had 'made him feel in good hu-&#xD;
mor. But it is dangerous to triflewith men&#xD;

'Be it so. I fear not your threats, Valdes,'&#xD;

o'clock on the evening of our story, a few&#xD;
minutes after the rescue of Louisette and&#xD;
aboutthe'time that Don Rafael and Bernito&#xD;
crossed the portal of the old convent on the&#xD;
secret errand, that a gentleman wrapped in a&#xD;
cloak and-his face shaded by a low broad, hat&#xD;
came from the direction of the mansion of&#xD;
M. Noel and approached the entrance with a&#xD;
free familiar :step. Before it were drawn up'&#xD;
two or three carriages of the first citizens who&#xD;
had doubtless called to meet friends lodging&#xD;
in the hotel previous to going into the salon.&#xD;
The black coachmen in gay lveries, a gen-&#xD;
darme, and one or two negresses in scarlet&#xD;
head dresses, stood aroundwhile two clowns,&#xD;
in grotesque masks, in theit midst were amus-&#xD;
ing them ; for scarcely a group that night was&#xD;
without one or more buffoons, whoseJets and&#xD;
broad wit made the streets ring with merri&#xD;
went.&#xD;
The jesters .were now aiming their wit at&#xD;
each other instead of the passers by, as was&#xD;
their custom. One of them was in all points&#xD;
attired in the spotted, motley costume of a&#xD;
boufon du cirque, wearing a ma-k painted&#xD;
extravagantly and with an expression of most&#xD;
mirthful grimace The other was a pauvre&#xD;
diable looking jester, with patched and, rag-&#xD;
ged habiliments, that looked more like the&#xD;
forced costume of poverty than a voluntary&#xD;
assumed.masquerading attire. He had more-&#xD;
over hat .one sad looking shoe on, the the&#xD;
other foot being wrapped in a part of a stock-&#xD;
ing. His knees were bare; and one elbow&#xD;
sticking out showed. that his upper man was&#xD;
a stranger to the luxury of linen. His coat&#xD;
had once, doubtless, rejoiced in two skirts,&#xD;
but it now had but one, and this held by a&#xD;
slight tenure. The upper button in front held&#xD;
its place, and the only one that did so, and&#xD;
being secured to the opposite button hole by&#xD;
a piece of green string, kept his throat cover-&#xD;
ed and supplied ingeniously the want of a&#xD;
cravat and collar. The coat had once been&#xD;
blue, and the pantaloons gray ; but it required&#xD;
nice discrimination to arrive at this certainty,&#xD;
for a more thorough tatterdemalion never&#xD;
walked forth. This might have been regarded&#xD;
as a chef d'ouvre in masquerading costume,&#xD;
but for the bare knees and foot; which, as the&#xD;
night was cold and chilly, with a heavy mist,&#xD;
which the-street lamps would scarcely radi-&#xD;
ate, seemed too much like necessity to be as-&#xD;
sumed. Above all he wore an old -mask not&#xD;
worth three sous. But never a merrier, laugh-&#xD;
ter exciting mask had flourished at Carnival.&#xD;
To look at it was to laugh, and to repeat the&#xD;
look ht  laugh again; and the mirth was&#xD;
heightened by the extraordinary contrast be..&#xD;
tween it and the wearer. He had but the&#xD;
moment before come round the corner where&#xD;
he had been holding discourse with Jacot, the&#xD;
gendarme. As he made his appearance in&#xD;
&#xD;
bouffon was entertaining his little circle of&#xD;
listeners, the latter stopped short in the midst&#xD;
of a jest and stared at him in silence. He 'saw&#xD;
he had a rival of an extraordinary character.&#xD;
''Bong swor, camarady,' said the ne w-comer&#xD;
shuffling up among them as well as he could&#xD;
for his one shoe and stocking. 'How do do.&#xD;
brother. Dontstop for me ! I never intrude !&#xD;
Laugh away, and be merry, that's my motto,&#xD;
Sing to day and cry tomorrow!'&#xD;
'Is that your own costume, Monsieur Chif-&#xD;
fan ?  What chiffonier have you for your&#xD;
tailor?' asked the clown, turning him round&#xD;
andlsurveying him on all sides. -&#xD;
'It's my-own, brother! I'm a poor devil,&#xD;
you see, and have had to keep myself dark&#xD;
coz I hadn't any thing to wear better than&#xD;
flowing robes; but they are fashionable in&#xD;
carnival and so you see I am sporting 'em !&#xD;
It's a brave thing, brother, to be able to walk&#xD;
the streets again, and make one's rags a holi-&#xD;
day suit.'&#xD;
' Marry, butyou're a queer jester4' said:the&#xD;
clown, laughing and clapping him on the&#xD;
shoulder. ' But I don't know, Monsieur Le&#xD;
Chiffon,* whether you are in earnest or not.&#xD;
I am in doubt still whether you are really a&#xD;
mask proper or a pauere diable, which I should&#xD;
call a mask improper. Allons! give me and&#xD;
these gentlemen an account of yourself, your&#xD;
birth, parentage, your name, age, expecta-&#xD;
tions, and the ,amount of' your worldly pos-&#xD;
sessions and appurtenances. For, I am king-&#xD;
jester hereabouts and no rival who shall not&#xD;
prove himself equal to me, shall have place&#xD;
on the pave.'&#xD;
1 I came into the world crying;- my parent-&#xD;
age I trace quite up to Adams; my name is&#xD;
Joel Trulock; my age is seven and twenty;&#xD;
my expectations are that your honorable wor-&#xD;
ship will invite me to take a glass of noyeau&#xD;
with you and this honorable company in the&#xD;
caf# over the way; the amount of my worldly&#xD;
possessions is this mask, and all my appurte-&#xD;
nances are these tatters!'&#xD;
Notwithstanding the lively tone in which&#xD;
the merry mask rattled off this, in the closing&#xD;
words his voice fell and there was visible a&#xD;
slight tremor, as if behind the grimacing vi-&#xD;
sor, was hid deeper emotion than he would&#xD;
have exposed to his fellowmen. The emotion&#xD;
did not escape the notice of the clown. In a&#xD;
low voice of pity he turned and said to those&#xD;
around him in Creole French,&#xD;
' Ai, citoyens, il est un pauvre! un misera&#xD;
ble. There is-no masking here; no jesting&#xD;
for me with guenilles like these!'&#xD;
'Non, non, monsieur!' responded all pres-&#xD;
ent with a feeling that did credit to the heart&#xD;
even at such a time of wild license, when&#xD;
every thing became materiel for jests and&#xD;
jokes.&#xD;
' Pauvre garcon!' said, in a feeling tone, a&#xD;
fat mulatress, with an orange-colored ker-&#xD;
chief, bound about hser head, dressed in a&#xD;
flashy blue and red striped silk gown, and&#xD;
* qivln to M. Ragamuffin.&#xD;
&#xD;
er.'Young man,' he said in English, 'I have&#xD;
heard your reply to this mask. Are these&#xD;
rags real indications of your poverty or are&#xD;
they assumed for the carnival? As he spoke&#xD;
he turned so that the light revealed the fea-&#xD;
tures of Florence Noel, who had but a few&#xD;
moments before parted near his house from&#xD;
Louisette and the young buccaneer. The&#xD;
tone of his voice was serious and betrayed ini-&#xD;
terest.&#xD;
'Yes, monsher,' replied the merry looking&#xD;
mask in the accent of New England.&#xD;
'Are you truly so destitute that you can&#xD;
only appear abroad at carnival, because your&#xD;
rags may pass for a masquerading costume?'&#xD;
The mask was silent. The clown and the&#xD;
others stood around Istening. At length he&#xD;
answered in a tone evidently much moved;&#xD;
but which there was plainly a strong effort to&#xD;
conceal under the merry voice of reckless&#xD;
hilarity which he had assumed to suit his&#xD;
nask-&#xD;
'I am truly a poor destitute devil, monsher;&#xD;
but that is not enough to make a man cry,&#xD;
while carnival lasts! I have had a three days&#xD;
holiday and here and there have by favor of&#xD;
my mask picked up a picayune to keep me&#xD;
from starving. 'It takes but little money to&#xD;
keep a man alive, I've tried that.'&#xD;
'You seem very cheerful for one so poor,'&#xD;
said Florence. Noel, looking upon the mask&#xD;
not without a disposition to smile while his&#xD;
generous bosom bled at the sight of rags, so&#xD;
wretched that only the disguise of a carnival&#xD;
would suffer them in the open streets.&#xD;
'It's a poor creature will give up with his&#xD;
fortunes, monsher; and 1 find a man can live&#xD;
longer on jokes than groans  It makes a man&#xD;
starve sooner to sigh much. I have cracked&#xD;
many a joke with an empty stomach and it&#xD;
helped me along as if I had cracked a nut and&#xD;
-      eat the meat! A laugh helpeth a void stomn-&#xD;
ach and maketh it quiet an hour long! Ah,&#xD;
takeslit practice and patience and some philos-&#xD;
ophy, messieurs, to know how to starve with-&#xD;
out dying outright !'&#xD;
This was spoken with recklessness, but&#xD;
there was discoverable an under-tone of deep&#xD;
&#xD;
4y."?&#xD;
&#xD;
a huge boquet of natural flowers in her yel-&#xD;
low hand, which was glittering with gold&#xD;
rings;' he is very poor to be a jester!'&#xD;
.' Mon Dieu! such ragsI and such a mask&#xD;
grimacing above them, as if laughing at pov-&#xD;
erty - said another.&#xD;
I You shall drink with me, Monsieur pauvre&#xD;
diable !' said the clown! But you shall have&#xD;
brandy and not noyeau, which will do for wo-&#xD;
men!'&#xD;
'Brandy is too strong, monsieur! It gets&#xD;
into my head.'&#xD;
S'You shall then have what you will. Al-&#xD;
Ions!'.&#xD;
The other was about to follow the clown,&#xD;
when the person in the cloak, who had ap-&#xD;
proached the postal of the hotel, and had&#xD;
paused to listen and -observe this scene, ad-&#xD;
vanced and touched bimlightly on the should-&#xD;
&#xD;
feeling and mental suffering in the cadence of&#xD;
the, last few sentences.&#xD;
tI could not laugh for the rags that would&#xD;
bid me weep, mon ami,' said the clown.&#xD;
' There be no patches in my soul, man. My&#xD;
spirit hath no rent in it. Inside o'me I am as&#xD;
good as I ever was '&#xD;
'Thou art so humorsome, camarade; thy&#xD;
poverty hath given thee such good nature,&#xD;
that verily, I envy thee. I would not have&#xD;
thee rich, thou art so roerry a poor man'!Un-&#xD;
mask for use, bon camarade, else we will not&#xD;
believe thee, for thou hast too well fed a&#xD;
speech to have a starved abdomen.'&#xD;
' Dost not see my hands, and my elbows ?&#xD;
Have they not speech too?' he said extend-&#xD;
ing his bony hand and shrivelled arm!'&#xD;
',Mon Dieu! Thou art the veriest skeletons&#xD;
ever walked about,' said the clown, with a&#xD;
pitying tone mingling with his jest.&#xD;
' Will you unmask?' asked M. Noel in a&#xD;
tone of commisseration.&#xD;
' Not here ! I am a poor outcast, but I have*&#xD;
a little pride! I should riot have been so free&#xD;
with my words had I not been under a mask.'&#xD;
'I am M. Noel-Florence Noel. I reside&#xD;
on this street, not very far from hence. Here&#xD;
are two pieces of gold. Take them und feed&#xD;
and clothe yourself in the nighest magazine.&#xD;
Tomorrow call on me.'&#xD;
Florence left the gold in his thin hand and&#xD;
entered the portal of the hotel. The young&#xD;
man stood looking after him with both hands&#xD;
extended as if he would fly towards him to&#xD;
embrace his feet He then looked at t be coin&#xD;
and with a wild cry, something hetween a&#xD;
laugh and a shriek, he started up the R ue Roy-&#xD;
ale at a speed that surprised those whbo had&#xD;
seen the weakness of his attenuated per-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
&amp;amp; Le Pauvre! Sacre! The mani ii mad&#xD;
with the gold!' exclaimed the clown  See&#xD;
how he runs! He has already (list'! ppeared in&#xD;
the darkness! M. Noel is generous. Vive&#xD;
M. NoelI!'&#xD;
This was responded to with animation ; for&#xD;
all seemed to know young Florenm" Niel.&#xD;
The group then began to speak in praise of&#xD;
his generosity and also to talk (it tie mPauvre&#xD;
diable,' who had been the object of' it, at this&#xD;
time.&#xD;
' The poor man never suffers. it M . Flor-&#xD;

' Such men as he alone should have , \alth,'&#xD;
said the gendarme. 'I know of mani- : poor&#xD;

' That pauvre he has just aided wil now&#xD;

is thit bal-costume you have there, Madame,&#xD;
carrying so carefully wrapped up? but not so&#xD;
that we cannot see it is very superb!' he ad-&#xD;
ded to the mulatto women.&#xD;
'This is for Madamoiselle Emme. It was,&#xD;
to be there at half past seven, as she wanted&#xD;
to be at the bal at eight.'&#xD;
'What is the masque she will wear, Mad-&#xD;
ame;' asked one of the gaily attired negresses.&#xD;
' That I must not tell, Madamoiselle Diane,'&#xD;
answered the woman,- gravely shaking her&#xD;
head, and continuing on her way. An arri-&#xD;
val of a gay party of masquers in an open car-&#xD;
riage at the door on Rue St. Louis, now at-&#xD;
tracted and dispersed the group, the clown&#xD;
resuming his mask and hastening to see them&#xD;
alilit and to amuse the by-standers by his&#xD;
jokes and jests upon their several peculiarities&#xD;
of manner and costume.&#xD;
Florence Noel took his way up a magnifi-&#xD;
cent flight of stairs to a grand vestibule from&#xD;
which several doors led to the suites of rooms&#xD;
occupied by the guests and families sojourn-&#xD;
ing at the hotel ; and others conducted to&#xD;
the hall of the table d'hote, and the salon of&#xD;
the masquerade on the Rue St. Louis front.&#xD;
We will go back to a quarter of an hour be-&#xD;
fore his arrival and precede him to a suit of&#xD;
noble rooms on the side of Rue Royale to-&#xD;
wards which, conducted by a servant to an-&#xD;
nounce him, he was taking his way. The&#xD;
suite consisted of three rooms; a parlor and&#xD;
two inner-chambers, one of which was a cabi-&#xD;
net de toilette. The parlor was furnished in&#xD;
the most expensive luxury and contained every&#xD;
article that could gratify taste or add to. com-&#xD;
fort. Without indivualizing we will mention&#xD;
broad mirrors in massive frames shining with&#xD;
gold ; the gorgeousness of the damask- and&#xD;
purple drapery of the tall windows d deux&#xD;
battans opening upon the balcony on Rue&#xD;
Royale; the costly girandoles, the fauteuil, the&#xD;
ottoman, the oriental velvet covered lounge&#xD;
of blue crimson, or violet colors, and heavy&#xD;
with gold and silver fringe; the marble pier&#xD;
tables with their costly burdens of porcelain&#xD;
vases; the gilded volumes strewn around;&#xD;
the fine paintings hanging from the walls;&#xD;
and the thousand and one elegancies that con-&#xD;
tribute to the pleasure and luxury of the opu-&#xD;
lent and educated.&#xD;
This was a private apartment, and the adja-&#xD;
cent bed-rooms, one of which opened into the&#xD;
other, appertained to it. These chambers weie&#xD;
equally rich in their internal arrangements,&#xD;
their couches with golden canopies and silk-&#xD;
wrouight hangings; their alabaster layers and&#xD;
full length toilet mirrors.&#xD;
But one of the cressets in the chandelier in&#xD;
the drawing-room was lighted, and gave just&#xD;
enough light to give depth and tone, as a paint-&#xD;
er would express it, to the interior of the noble&#xD;
room we have described. Within the influ-&#xD;
ence of this soft light stood a young lady of daz-&#xD;
&#xD;
zling beauty. in her hand she held a green&#xD;
vizor, and her costume was that of an Oriental&#xD;
princess. Her height, the noble contour of her&#xD;
head, the lofty yet sweet dignity of her air,&#xD;
singularly harmonized with the imperial mag-&#xD;
nificence of her apparel. Her hair was a dark&#xD;
soft auburn- brown, and arrayed with great&#xD;
simplicity and taste in the most elegant chain&#xD;
of involved braids, through which was en-&#xD;
wreathed a band of pearls, which passing with&#xD;
the whole of the shining hair beneath her&#xD;
ears, bound it together behind the head very&#xD;
low in the neck, with a clasp composed of a&#xD;
single pearl  Her complexion was exceed-&#xD;
ingly fair, but not too much blonde; a rich&#xD;
warmth giving to it life and glowing beauty.&#xD;
She was-about nineteen or perhaps twenty;&#xD;
but her manner had the repose and self pos-&#xD;
session of a riper age. Her eyes which were&#xD;
of the purest hazel, in which played the light&#xD;
of a bright and cheerful spirit, were possessed&#xD;
of an expression so soft, yet brilliant, so re-&#xD;
tiring yet captivating, so daring yet shrink-&#xD;
ing, so subdued yet so full of feeling, that we&#xD;
despair of conveying it to the reader. He must&#xD;
recall the beautiful eyes of his dreams, or re-&#xD;
vive those of his fonder memories, if he&#xD;
would form an idea.of the expression of the&#xD;
beautiful hazel eyes of Georgiana Warfield!&#xD;
He must also refer to the fairest lips and&#xD;
brightest smile that he treasures in his heart&#xD;
of hearts, if he would form something like a&#xD;
correct idea of her mouth and smile.&#xD;
Her features were feminine to the last de-&#xD;
gree, and their faultless regularity and high&#xD;
finish gave her, with the aid of her tall and&#xD;
superb figure, an aristocratic look and air too&#xD;
decidedly marked to be mistaken. Such a&#xD;
face could be allied to no inferior lineage.&#xD;
Colonel Warfield her father was a distinguish-&#xD;
ed Kentuckian, and a lineal descendant of&#xD;
the proud Earls of Warfield, to which title he&#xD;
held by descent, and recent death of the late&#xD;
Earl, a just claim; but he preferred rather to&#xD;
be a citizen of a free republic than live a noble&#xD;
in the sceptered empire of his fathers. He&#xD;
was possessed of great wealth and this daugh-&#xD;
ter was his only child. She had the year be-&#xD;
fore accompanied her father to Washington&#xD;
where he held a seat, and dazzled the capital&#xD;
by her charms then just unfolding.  This&#xD;
winter having resigned his political trust into&#xD;
the hands of his constituents, Colonel War-&#xD;
field had brought his daughter with him to&#xD;
the gay metropolis of Louisiana. They had&#xD;
been here now three months, and during this&#xD;
period, the beauty of the belle Kentuckian&#xD;
had fascinated and enchained more than one&#xD;
noble and worthy young man.&#xD;
Georgiana Warfield with all her beauty was&#xD;
a sensible and thinking person. Her mind was&#xD;
well cultivated, and for her heart nature had&#xD;
done all that was needful. She was generous,&#xD;
feeling, and full of high and noble impulses.&#xD;
She did good unceasingly, and sweet charity&#xD;
adorned her 'as with a crown of silver.'&#xD;
She was now standing by a marble table&#xD;
with the soft light of the girandole made ro-&#xD;

The Grisette aud her Mistress-. conversa-&#xD;
tion in which a discovery is made-The&#xD;
Two Suitors.&#xD;
TnE handsome grisette, Ninette, had clasp-&#xD;
ed the diamond bracelet upon the moulded&#xD;
arm of the beautiful Kentuckian; the slave&#xD;
at her feet had laced the elegant silver&#xD;
wrought boot securely around the fair ancle;&#xD;
and the toilette of Georgiana Warfield was&#xD;
complete   Ninette stood off a little distance&#xD;
and surveyed her with admiration and a sort&#xD;
of child-like awe.&#xD;
'Ah, Mademoiselle, you are too much&#xD;
elegant6 and beautiful!  You will conquer&#xD;
andbreak hearts and triumph; oh, so great&#xD;
will you triumph you will have all the gen-&#xD;
tilhommes kneeling at your feet!  Is not&#xD;
Mademoiselle Varfield vrai charmante ?' She&#xD;
added, turning to the middle-aged slave who&#xD;
had been Georgiana's nurse in infancy and&#xD;
wap now her kindly treated friend and ser-&#xD;
vaht. Ninette could not have appealed to&#xD;
more partial testimony.&#xD;
'Yis, Missy Marmsell,' answered Clara&#xD;
with a bright look of patronizing approbation.&#xD;
'Miss Georgy al'ays is a angel, and now she&#xD;
look like de queen of de angel.'&#xD;
'Oh, my good Clara, and Ninette,' said&#xD;
Miss Warfield laughing, 'you will make me&#xD;
so vain that I will have to wear something&#xD;
graver for penance.'&#xD;
S'Ah, Mademoiselle, you would look angel-&#xD;
ique in any thing you please to put on. Eut&#xD;
this violet robe is so becoming to your com.&#xD;
plexion!  This tunic of silver tissue is so&#xD;
magnifique! And your jacket of purple and&#xD;
gold all laced so elegantly with the embroid-&#xD;
ered'corsage! Never was anything so beau-&#xD;
tiful, except Mademoiselle's taste itself, which&#xD;
devised and created such perfect costume.'&#xD;
'Indeed, Ninette, I must stop your two&#xD;
little cherry lips, they prattle so!  1 believe&#xD;
you rattle on only to please yourself that you&#xD;
can talk a little English. You must not talk&#xD;
so much!' And the beautiful princess en&#xD;
&#xD;
seated by reflection from the crimson curtains&#xD;
of the windows, falling upon her face as it&#xD;
was cast down in an attitude of pleasant&#xD;
thought. At her feet kneeled a female slave&#xD;
engaged in fastening an azure silver-worked&#xD;
slipper with silken cords about her shapely&#xD;
foot, and by her side stood a youthful French&#xD;
femme du toilette fastening a bracelet upon&#xD;
her ivory arm. She did not, however, seem to&#xD;
regard them or their presence, but was wholly&#xD;
lost inher own thoughtswhich were pleasing,&#xD;
and perhaps tender, to judge from the smile&#xD;
that slept rather than played about the mouth,&#xD;
and the soft color that deepened the roseate&#xD;
beauty of the cheek.&#xD;
&#xD;

costume smiled and glanced father superb per-&#xD;
son, through the door, reflected in the dis-&#xD;
tant mirror of the cabinet do toilette,' from&#xD;
which she had a few moments before come&#xD;
forth.'&#xD;
' Bon, Mademoiselle Varfield,' said Ninette,&#xD;
merrily. 'I talk English because it sounds&#xD;
so sweet and musical when you speak it. And&#xD;
you are very kind to speak it with me. Ah&#xD;
Mademoiselle,' said Ninette, folding her&#xD;
hands and sighing. 'I wish M. Florence&#xD;
could see you now! He would fall down and&#xD;
adore you!'&#xD;
Georgiana started, colored deeply and then&#xD;
said, in a tone of reproof, meant to be severe&#xD;
but which was very gentle,&#xD;
'You should not be so-free, Ninette? How&#xD;
often have I reproved this forwardness.. It Is&#xD;
not becoming, Ninette!'&#xD;
' Pardonnez moi, Mademoiselle.' said the&#xD;
grisette, casting her finely expressive eyes&#xD;
doucely to the ground, and laying her little&#xD;
dimpled hands across her bosom.&#xD;
' You are pardoned, Ninette,' said her mis-&#xD;
tress, laughing at her deprecating appear-&#xD;
ance. The countenance of the grisette bright-&#xD;
ened up at once.&#xD;
4 Mademoiselle is so kind and good! I&#xD;
hope Madamoiselle will have a good husband.'&#xD;
And Ninette sighed.&#xD;
'Again, Ninette ?'&#xD;
'Ah, Mademoiselle, pardonnez moiI When&#xD;
I see you looking so happy and so beautiful,&#xD;
I sigh to think if you marry that dark-look-&#xD;
ing Spaniard, Don Rafael, he will, perhaps,&#xD;
make those fine eyes shed plenty tears, and&#xD;
that jewelled corsage heave with many a&#xD;
sigh!'&#xD;
' Why do you think so, Ninette ?'- asked&#xD;
Georgiana, struck with her manner, which&#xD;
was unusually serious, or perhaps, better said&#xD;
sentimental.&#xD;
' He is said to be very wicked.  And I&#xD;
have heard of cruel things he has done.'&#xD;
'These are only the gossip of porters'&#xD;
lodges, enfant,' answered her mistress with a&#xD;
paler cheek, and a graver look. ' Don Rafael&#xD;
is a gentleman of wealth and family.  His&#xD;
father was a Grandee of Spain, his mother a&#xD;
beautiful Louisianian of the last regime, and&#xD;
related to the family of the President. He is&#xD;
proud and perhaps^ haughty; but - he is a&#xD;
noble gentleman, educated and esteemed.'&#xD;
' Mademoiselle has only seen him here&#xD;
when he assumed all he wished you to think&#xD;
him to be,' said Ninette with earnestness in&#xD;
tone and looks; of his private character he&#xD;
lets you know nothing. He deceived you to&#xD;
make you his wife, and then, aie ! Helas! he&#xD;
will show you himself. Ah, ma chere madan-&#xD;
ois6LVarfield, if you dont wish to be made&#xD;
parfatement miserable, do not never marry&#xD;
that wicked Don Rafael Valdes! I could tell&#xD;
you more I have heard, madamoiselle,' added&#xD;
the grisette coloring, hesitating and droppi'&#xD;
her eyes while she let her fingers insensible&#xD;
play with the ribbon of her coquettish little&#xD;

' Well, child.'&#xD;
'9I think that there is none of the gentle.&#xD;

Miss Warfield dropped her gaze upon the&#xD;

velvet rose in its surface with the toe of her&#xD;
silver slipper; for she was now seated on an&#xD;
ottoman near where she had been standing,&#xD;
while Ninette stood demurely before her a lit-&#xD;
tle ways off, Clara the slave having returned&#xD;
into the'cabinet de toilette.&#xD;

' No, Ninette. Go on. What have you to&#xD;

' That he is a noble gentleman, and in&#xD;
wealth and birth is equal if not superior to&#xD;

'You have really taken quite a positive dis-&#xD;

' He has not offended me only that he should&#xD;
presume to look to your hand, my noble Ma-&#xD;

'You are very good, Ninette to interest&#xD;
yourself so much In me,' said her mistress&#xD;
with a bright but transient smile. 'You were&#xD;
speaking. of M. Florence Noel,' she added&#xD;
without raising her eyes, and in a tone as if&#xD;
she would have. recalled the name as she&#xD;
spoke it It was a faltering cadence. The&#xD;
voice warmed and fulled an4 trembled in its&#xD;
enunciation of it. A reader' of the human&#xD;
heart-the skilful in woman's heart would&#xD;
have marked this and feared nothing from the&#xD;
influence of Don Rafael. The name she had&#xD;
spoken he would discern was the talisman to&#xD;
lay open the secret passion of her soul. Ninette&#xD;
had not much experience or reading in human&#xD;
nature; but she possessed that feminine in-&#xD;
stinct which is wisdom and judgment. She&#xD;
saw at a glance that there was no danger to&#xD;
apprehend from 'the wicked Valdes;' and&#xD;
her little heart bounded as if it would fly out&#xD;
of her bosom, snugly confined as it was, un-&#xD;
der a neatly fitting jaquette of scarlet satin,&#xD;
with joy at the discovery.&#xD;
' Ah, 14adamoiselle,' she said, her expres-&#xD;
live face looking as sunny as a spring morn-&#xD;
g    'I see I need not speak of M. Florence.&#xD;
1 am so glad-so happy.'&#xD;
' Why what does the little vixen mean?'&#xD;
oried Georgiana blushing in spite of herself&#xD;
still deeper than before, and with a look of&#xD;
conscious intelligence giving expression to&#xD;
her half-drooped countenance.&#xD;
' I mean, Madamoiselle, that I was very&#xD;
foolish and very much mistaken. But then&#xD;
&#xD;
21'&#xD;
&#xD;
Don Rafael was so particular in his visits!&#xD;
You rode out with him on horseback; and&#xD;
he visited you so often--so much oftener&#xD;
than M. Florence!. and you sang to him and'&#xD;
'One. may do all this, Ninette, and not&#xD;
love,' said her mistress smiling.&#xD;
' Ah, yes, madamoiselle ! But Don Rafael&#xD;
was rich and so attentive and bold, that I&#xD;
feared for you! and all the while M.Florence&#xD;
was loving you with such adoration and con-&#xD;
suming away with his silent passion.  He&#xD;
would not call often, and he was always so&#xD;
respectful, so diffident, so gentle-so different&#xD;
from Don Rafael, who would laugh aloud&#xD;
when with you, and go out of the parlor&#xD;
whistling and drumming the 'devil's tatoo'&#xD;
on his boot with his riding switch.'&#xD;
Miss Warfield smiled.. Ninette had good&#xD;
reason, we must allow, for suspecting an im-&#xD;
pression had been made upon the heart of her&#xD;
beautiful mistress by the opulent young Span-&#xD;
iard. This person's parentage has already&#xD;
been spoken off. He  was a Creole Spaniard&#xD;
of an American mother, and had been edu-&#xD;
cated at Harvard University.  By the death&#xD;
of his father, shortly after he came to matu-&#xD;
rity he inherited an immense fortune which&#xD;
he devoted to his pleasures. He moved in&#xD;
the best society an acknowledged equal, for,&#xD;
he kept his vices for his private hours. He,&#xD;
therefore, possessed two characters for a long&#xD;
time; one, that of a gay fashionable Creole-&#xD;
whose time was passed in the rounds of&#xD;
amusement which wealth can command;&#xD;
the other that of a low, unprincipled sensual-&#xD;
ist, and villain-of the worst description. One&#xD;
class of men knew him alone in one charac-&#xD;
ter; another class alone in the other  With&#xD;
the one- he associated as an equal in social&#xD;
rank; with the other as the mover in schemes&#xD;
of villainy of which they were the agents or&#xD;
else victims. He had early met in society the&#xD;
beautiful Kentuckian, whose name was on&#xD;
every lip arid the toast of every circle of&#xD;
young Creoles, and his position in society&#xD;
gave him a ready access to her presence&#xD;
and acquaintance. Don Rafael was a man of&#xD;
an elegant exterior, and he could render him-&#xD;
self pleasing .to whomsoever he cared to&#xD;
please. His talents were as varied as his&#xD;
morals were perverted. The superb style of&#xD;
beauty of Miss Warfield struck him and ex-&#xD;
cited his admiration.  He at once became&#xD;
enamored with her, if a man like him could&#xD;
love; and having understood that she was&#xD;
also an heiress, he resolved to leave no effort&#xD;
untried to win her hand. There was also a&#xD;
species of eclat in becoming the successful&#xD;
suitor for a hand for which every young man&#xD;
of any pretensions was sighing. Bold, con-&#xD;
fident, and proud, Don Rafael believed he had&#xD;
only to make the effort to be successful. He&#xD;
became a constant attendant upon her morn-.&#xD;
ing levees, always outstay ing others; he rode&#xD;
with her on the river banks; he waltzed with&#xD;
her; he promenaded with her; he was ever&#xD;
her attendant. For a time he forgot his lower&#xD;
pleasures in the society of one so elevated,&#xD;
&#xD;
and whose influence was so purifying. What-&#xD;
ever my have been his primary motives in&#xD;
paying his cmrt to her, Don Rafael could not&#xD;
long remain within the light of so much vir-&#xD;
tue, beauty and grace, without feeling a: deep-&#xD;
er emotion than the mere passion of the hour,&#xD;
or only ambition for success! His heart was&#xD;
taken captive, and his whole being Involved&#xD;
in one absorbing feeling. Day after day is&#xD;
passion deepened and strengthened, 'till he&#xD;
confessed in his heart that his existence and&#xD;
happiness hung upon her lips.&#xD;
Georgiana Warfield, at first pleased with&#xD;
the attentions of a man, elegant in person,&#xD;
with expressive features, possessed of wealth,&#xD;
and moving in the front rank of the best so-&#xD;
ciety, and for whose attentions more than one&#xD;
beautiful Creole sighed in vain, suffered this&#xD;
intimacy to continue for several weeks; and&#xD;
though she did not encourage his addresses,&#xD;
she suffered them. At length, blinded by her&#xD;
seeming pleasure in his society, and deceived&#xD;
by her affability and condescension, he be-&#xD;
came careless and self-confident, believing he&#xD;
had only to propose for her band to receive it.&#xD;
In this delusive opinion he became less cau-&#xD;
tious in concealing his true moral character,&#xD;
and in several instances of late had so far for-&#xD;
gotten himself as to expose to her a heart&#xD;
startingly corrupt and depraved. This dis-&#xD;
covery led her to reflection upon his charac-&#xD;
ter and intentions, and the result was a reso-&#xD;
jlution, henceforth so to treat Don Rafael as to&#xD;
show him that she was wholly indifferent to&#xD;
him, and, however he might think, had no&#xD;
place in her affections. There was another&#xD;
motive also which we shall shortly allude- to.&#xD;
The suitor was not long in 'discovering this&#xD;
change in her manner ; a sudden change from&#xD;
a frank friendly intercourse to one of coldness&#xD;
and reserve.&#xD;
' How is it Senora ?' he said to her with&#xD;
something like anger in his tone a few&#xD;
days before the opening of our atory, rising,&#xD;
after a brief, embarrassed morning visit, and&#xD;
standing near her;. ' how is it I find this cold-&#xD;
ness of manner, and em treated almost with&#xD;
insult ?'&#xD;
'I witnessed a piece oferuelty in you yes-&#xD;
terday, Senor Valdes, that has reversed my&#xD;
opinion of you,' she said firmly. I&#xD;
'What? merely riding my horse over a&#xD;
crippled negro ?' he said laughing carelessly.&#xD;
' I noticed you spoke to me then of it, but I&#xD;
did not suppose you felt so much about a&#xD;
trifle like that ! my horse was most injured,&#xD;
and this morning he is fairly lamed!t' .'&#xD;
'You may regard it a trifle to tread down&#xD;
beneath your horse's hoofs -a miserable, crip-&#xD;
ple because he does not soon enough remove&#xD;
himself from your road. But I think very&#xD;
differently.' I&#xD;
'Are you serious?' demanded -Don Rafael&#xD;
with a look of haughty surprise.'&#xD;
The suiter bit his lip and endeavored to&#xD;
suppress his displeasure. He laughed again,&#xD;
&#xD;
but it was a bitter laugh; one of mingled de-&#xD;
rision and vexation.&#xD;
'It was this then that made you return to&#xD;
the city?&#xD;
'Yes, Senor.'&#xD;
'And this is the cause of your present'treat-&#xD;
ment of me?'&#xD;
4 Not alone, Don Rafael.'&#xD;
'This is coquetry ! It is affectation !'he said&#xD;
angrily.&#xD;
' Sir, you forget yourself, and to whom you&#xD;
are speaking,' she said drawing herself up&#xD;
with womanly pride, her eyes 'lighting up&#xD;
with spirit. Don Rafael's magnet instantly&#xD;
changed. He saw his fair prize was in dan-&#xD;
ger of being lost to him. He flung himself&#xD;
on one knee before her, partly with assumed,&#xD;
partly'with real emotion, for he loved her&#xD;
with'deep passion.&#xD;
At this moment a servant announced,&#xD;
' M. Florence Noel.&#xD;
' Admit him,' she said with a look and tone&#xD;
that was in singular contrast with her words&#xD;
and air the moment preceding.&#xD;
A soft, pleasurable glow took the place of&#xD;
the flush that kindled her ceek, and retreat-&#xD;
ing from the kneeling Don 'tifael, e 'ad.&#xD;
vanced a step towards the door to receive the&#xD;
visitor. Valdes sprung to his feet,,and with&#xD;
a, dark, scowling brow, and flashing eyes,&#xD;
stood surveying tne entrance. Thrice before&#xD;
had le encountered Florence Noel here in his&#xD;
visits, and even then a *spitit'of rival" feeling&#xD;
disturbed his bosom. The evident pleasure&#xD;
with which Miss Warfield now heard' him in-&#xD;
nounced at once' inflamed his bosom with&#xD;
jealousy. He resolved to 'wait and see him&#xD;
enter, watch the meeting of the 'yes, the&#xD;
tone and manner of her reception i 'to ee if&#xD;
he could not draw from -them confirmation of&#xD;
his rising suspicions, that not the'affitir of the&#xD;
crippled slave, noriany other matter of the&#xD;
kind she had witnesses, had produced the&#xD;
change of her manner towards him; a change&#xD;
he had observed not only this morning, but&#xD;
had noticed even 'some days before&#xD;
'1' Ah M. Noel. I am delighted to see you&#xD;
this morningg' said Miss, Warfield receiving&#xD;
him with a look of animation; perhaps, 'with&#xD;
more than, under other circumstances she&#xD;
would have shown. '1 *as planning a ride &amp;amp;&#xD;

'Don Rafael Valdes,'doubtless would be hap-&#xD;

me that he has badly lamed his favorite hbse,&#xD;
through the careless blundering of tin 'old&#xD;
lame negro who was so foolish as to be in the&#xD;
street,'and whom 'he run over!'&#xD;
Don Rafael did not grind his teeth together&#xD;
at this cutting ii-ony because he was toe cour-&#xD;
teous; and he did not wish 'to show feeling&#xD;
either before her or his rival-for such he&#xD;

who had met with so gracious a reception, to&#xD;
be. He stood silent and boiling over with&#xD;
rage and vengeance. Florence had nodded&#xD;
to him as Georgiana named him,.and he re-&#xD;
turned the recognition with a haughty bend&#xD;
of his head.&#xD;
'No doubt Emme would be delighted with&#xD;
the excursion,' answered Florence, his heart&#xD;
throbbing with a sweet trembling pleasure at&#xD;
the gracious and friendly manner of - one&#xD;
whom he passionately loved in the depths of&#xD;
his heart, and whose very foot print, he would&#xD;
have knelt and reverently kissed. True love&#xD;
in a generous breast is ever humble. It low-&#xD;
ers itself and elevates its object. It mani-&#xD;
fests itself more in silent looks, in deep emo-&#xD;
tions, than in words. Such was hitherto the&#xD;
love of Florence Noel, for Miss Warfield.&#xD;
He had seen her and loved her in silence afar&#xD;
off. His love placed her too high to be ap-&#xD;
proached, and he rather shunned than sought&#xD;
her presence. To obtain a glimpse of her&#xD;
passing, in her carriage was a rich repast on&#xD;
which his wrapt senses revelled for hours; to&#xD;
speak with her-for a few moments was a life-&#xD;
long bliss! And intimacy had sprung up be-&#xD;
tween his, scarcely less beautiful, sister Em-&#xD;
me, to whom we shall soon introduce the&#xD;
reader, and thus he was oftener thrown into&#xD;
her society under circumstances favorable to&#xD;
the growth of a pure passion like his. Each&#xD;
day he felt that the current of his life was&#xD;
mingling with hers; that from her idea his&#xD;
soul was drawing all its happiness!&#xD;
Too much interested Jin the gay and bril-&#xD;
liant scenes around her, and given up to the&#xD;
attention of Don Rafael, Georgiana at first&#xD;
did not appreciate the character of Florence&#xD;
Noel. But gradually its development opened&#xD;
her eyes to his worth, and from indifference&#xD;
she came to regard him with deep interest.&#xD;
By this time she began to discover the shades&#xD;
in the character of Don Rafael, and as each&#xD;
day disclosed some moral flaw in his heart,&#xD;
pach day brought to view some noble and&#xD;
generous trait in that of Florence. To con-&#xD;
trast the two young men under such. cireum-&#xD;
stances was irresistable, and it is needless to&#xD;
say Don Rafael suffered by it. At length&#xD;
Georgiana discovered that she was by no&#xD;
means an indifferent student of Florence No-&#xD;
el's character; that it could not be studied&#xD;
without being loved. She discovered, also,&#xD;
what maidens are quick to see, that although&#xD;
by look nor word had he ever told his pas-&#xD;
sion, he sincerely.loved her. This discovery&#xD;
led her to examine her own feelings, and she&#xD;
confessed to herself with a sweet blush ofcon-&#xD;
sciousness that if he wooed he should not be&#xD;
said 'nay.'&#xD;
Thus affairs 'stood with, the parties up to&#xD;
the time of the scene we have just gone back&#xD;
to narrate. Don Rafael stood a moment long-&#xD;
er when finding himself totally neglected,. he&#xD;
strode from the room giving, a' good morning'&#xD;

the position in which these individuals of our&#xD;
tale stand to each other we shall now return&#xD;
to the drawing room again on the carnival&#xD;
night and to Georgiana and the 'grisette, the&#xD;
latter of whom was interrupted in her gossip&#xD;
by a rap at the door, and the entrance of a&#xD;
servant presenting on a salver, a card on which&#xD;
Miss. Warfield read with a blushing smile&#xD;
'M. Florence Noel.'&#xD;
' Does M. Noel wait?'&#xD;
' He is in the ante-room, Madamoiselle.'&#xD;
'I will receive him.'&#xD;
'Oh, I am so delighted, mademoiselle,'&#xD;
'cried Ninette clapping her hands.&#xD;
'At what?'&#xD;
' That you love M. Florence instead of the&#xD;
proud and wicked Don Rafael.'&#xD;
' Hist you little Babillarde!' cried Georg-&#xD;
iana looking as severely as a half-smile would&#xD;
suffer her to do, at the grisette, who folding&#xD;
her hands across her bosom, retired into the&#xD;
cabinet de toilette though with one dark eye&#xD;
over her shoulder to see Florence Noel as he&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII-&#xD;
The Confession-The beautiful Creole- The&#xD;
Masquerade.&#xD;
M. Florence Noel on entering the drawing&#xD;
room was enveloped in a large cloak and car-&#xD;
ried in his hand one of those slouched hats&#xD;
worn abroad by masquers.&#xD;
'Pardon me, for wearing in my cloak, Ma-&#xD;
damoiselle Georgine, he said, closing the door&#xD;
before throwing-it aside. One does not al-&#xD;
ways care to have his costume exposed to the&#xD;
eyes of those in the halls.'&#xD;
' Do not apologise, M. Noel,' said Georgi-&#xD;
ana, her sweet, rich voice trembling with&#xD;
emotion which of late on seeing him it had&#xD;
got a habit ofdoing; an emotion mingled with&#xD;
an expression of deep silent joy. She gazed&#xD;
on him as she spoke with admiration. Never&#xD;
stood a nobler looking person in the presence&#xD;
of a maiden. Tall and elegant in figure, with&#xD;
a face of great beauty; an olive complexion,&#xD;
dark but rich: brown hair and mustache,; a&#xD;
look of noble pride and an air at once modest&#xD;
and commanding, the handsome Florence Noel&#xD;
stood before herin the splendid costume of a&#xD;
Persian Prince. She surveyed him in silence,&#xD;
and her heart did homage before 'him.&#xD;
' You will think me presumptuous,' he said&#xD;
in a voice a good deal embarrassed, 'but'my&#xD;
sister informed me that the secret of your cos-&#xD;
tume you had made known to her, that of a&#xD;
Per:sian princess. If I have been presumptu-&#xD;
ous in assuming this, I will atone for it avy&#xD;
any penance you may inflict.' This 'was&#xD;

spoken with graceful gallantry mixed with dif-&#xD;
fidence.&#xD;
'Your penance shall be to return and bring&#xD;
your sister Emme,' she said smiling. 'She&#xD;
was to come here you know and go with me&#xD;
into the salon under yours and my father s&#xD;
escort.'&#xD;
'Emme had not completed her toillete, when&#xD;
I left; there was some delay in-the arriving&#xD;
of her costume.  She will drive here in the&#xD;
carriage immediately on getting ready.'&#xD;
This was spoken with evident embarras-&#xD;
ment. His eyes were down-cast, and his fin-&#xD;
gers played nervously with the golden tassels&#xD;
of his diamond hilted sword. Miss Warfield&#xD;
began to feel her heart beat stronger, she&#xD;
could not tell why, and her eyes also fell to&#xD;
the carpet. There was for a few seconds an&#xD;
awkward silence. At length Florence, his face&#xD;
glowing with the deepest emotion, which&#xD;
heightened the manly beauty of his dark olive&#xD;
features, advanced towards her as she stood&#xD;
beneath the soft light of the burning cresset,&#xD;
and taking her hand knelt at her feet.&#xD;
'Pardon- me, my dear Miss Warfield,' he&#xD;
said in tones that seemed to come from his&#xD;
soul, and which fell like the nusic of a harp&#xD;
upon her ears, 'pardon me,for intruding alone&#xD;
upon you without the company of my sister!&#xD;
I blessed the delay which could give me a&#xD;
few moments in advance to see you alone if&#xD;
possible! Fortune has favored my trembling&#xD;
hopes! -&#xD;
He was silent! The hand be had taken lay&#xD;
passive within his. The diamond studded ves-&#xD;
ture of the startled, happy, expecting maiden&#xD;
heaved irregularly!  The eyes .lay couched&#xD;
beneath their fringed canopies, and met nol&#xD;
his !&#xD;
'I feel I am presumptuous!' he continue&#xD;
in a voice agitated yet persevering. 'But]&#xD;

that I might from your own lips learn my des&#xD;

I have found you alone as I wished, and yo&#xD;
have been so gracious as to listen to mydarin&#xD;
and unpardonable language. If I have of&#xD;

calmness as her agitation and deep joy woul&#xD;
permit her to assume ; * I feel honored by thi&#xD;
confidence arid manly confession. of regar&#xD;
&#xD;
for one who is conscious of being quite un-&#xD;
worthy of your noble and generous attach-,&#xD;

'Is it possible that I am not dreaming1-&#xD;
Is it possible that my fears are all -t'oncei&#xD;
scattered like a dark cloud, and that I am&#xD;
not indifferent to her in whose existence: my"&#xD;

ed too deep for coherent utterance. le press-&#xD;
ed his lips to her hand with grateful ardour,&#xD;
and then seizing the other would -have kissed&#xD;

I 'No, no, Florence,' she cried, blushing and&#xD;
laughing. ' I did not say in my little speech,&#xD;
I to you that I should give you this permis-&#xD;
sion.'&#xD;
Florence was too happy to rebel ; and seats&#xD;
ing himself by her side he seemed for the&#xD;
next five minutes quite to forget that he had,&#xD;
a tongue, and to think that eyes answered all&#xD;
the purpose for which tongues were given.&#xD;

braided and intertwined in tasteful folds on&#xD;
either temple. The crimson turban she wore&#xD;
gave to the cheek a glowing tint, that heigh.&#xD;
tene-d her charms. Her dark pencilled eye.&#xD;
brows; her small straight beautiful nose; her&#xD;
finely shaped mouth, deep red lips and pearl.&#xD;
white teeth; her softly rounded. enchanting-&#xD;
chmn, with her smile which like summer sun-&#xD;
light played and danced in and among all,&#xD;
composed a countenance of rare loveliness.&#xD;
And those who k-new Emme Noel said that&#xD;
&#xD;
her heart was as lovely as her face and person-&#xD;
These two noble characters, Florence and&#xD;
Emme were the children of M. Noel, a French-&#xD;
man of noble family, who had in Paris marri-&#xD;
ed a Lonisiainan lady of great beauty and ac-&#xD;
complishments; and soon afterwards he set-&#xD;
tled in New Orleans. Uniting his fortune to&#xD;
hers, and engaging in commercial business,&#xD;
he in a few years accumulated vast wealth.&#xD;
But his happiness was destroyed by the sud-&#xD;
den death of his wife, the seventh year after&#xD;
her marriage. He was not, however, left&#xD;
destitute. His two children Florence and&#xD;
Emme consoled him for his loss; and all his&#xD;
time and exertions were henceforth given to&#xD;
them. Quitting his business and settling up&#xD;
his affairs he devoted himself personally to&#xD;
their education. But the loss of his wife,&#xD;
whom he had tenderly loved preyed upon his&#xD;
mind; and time, instead ofassuaging his grief&#xD;
gave strength to his regrets. Florence had&#xD;
attained his twentieth year when he could not&#xD;
conceal from himself the painful fact that his&#xD;
father was gradually losing his mind. This&#xD;
affliction became more 'and more apparent,&#xD;
till at length he was incapable ofreasoning or&#xD;
conducting his affairs; though not yet fifty&#xD;
years of age. Emme and her brother lament-&#xD;
ed and wept over this misfortune to one to&#xD;
whom they were so tenderly devoted; but the&#xD;
object of their tears was insensible to the&#xD;
wretchedness his situation produced in the&#xD;
bosoms of his children.&#xD;
In this condition M. Noel had been now for&#xD;
five or six years past, confined to his . dwell-.&#xD;
ing and giving no signs of intelligence, He&#xD;
was a confirmed idiot. Yet with a devotion&#xD;
unceasing and full of filial tenderness and res-&#xD;
pect his children watched around his couch&#xD;
or chair, and together attended him in the&#xD;
carriage whenever the weather was pleasant.&#xD;
In their hands he was passive and child-like.&#xD;
This state of M. Noel was not generally known.&#xD;
With a delicacy that cannot be too highly com-&#xD;
mended his son had spoken of it to none, save&#xD;
to *those whose intimacy in his house could&#xD;
not but give them a sight to know it. The&#xD;
world still supposed that be managed his own&#xD;
estate, and that Florence was the dependent&#xD;
upon his bounty'; but in truth Florence had&#xD;
long had in his own hands the entire conduct&#xD;
of his father's affairs.&#xD;
We shall now precede the three personag-&#xD;
es of our tale whom we left in the drawing-&#xD;
room into the Salon, St. Louis, to which, by&#xD;
passing through the oalls they obtained ac-&#xD;
cess without descending into the street. On&#xD;
gaining the vestibule of the grande Salon,&#xD;
each enveloped in cloaks to conceal their&#xD;
disguises, and wearing vizors so as effectual-&#xD;
ly to defy any scrutiny of their features,&#xD;
they found a scene of life and novelty.&#xD;
Maskers were constantly arriving and as-&#xD;
cending the grand stair-case, some in full&#xD;
costume without cloaks and wearing masks,&#xD;
others, studiously, especially the ladies, con-&#xD;
cealing their costu-mes until they reached the&#xD;
ante-roomn. At the head of the flight of stairs&#xD;
&#xD;
stood two gendarmes with drawn swords in at&#xD;
their hands, who directed the guests to the fr&#xD;
ante-room. - Of these there were several, one.&#xD;
for gentlemen two for ladies; one for the cloaks ci&#xD;
and arms, and one which was used as a h&#xD;
magazine fbr dominos and niasks to supply w&#xD;
those who needed them, or wished to change a&#xD;
or disguise their costume. Leaving his cloak v&#xD;
in the ante-room in charge of a gendarme, p&#xD;
who also demanded his sword, Florence met ti&#xD;
Georgiana and his sister at the door of the an- a&#xD;
te-room, and handing his ticket to a gendarme b&#xD;
he entered the magnificent hall.The vast t&#xD;
apartment was already filled with a varied fi&#xD;
and splendid assembly; and the crash of the&#xD;
music rose high above the murmur of a thou- (&#xD;
sand voices. Fifty cotillions were on the floor t&#xD;
and hundreds who were not dancing were h&#xD;
promenading around the hall, bowing to, or C&#xD;
stopping, to converse with those who wearied t&#xD;
with dancing had sought the rich cushions&#xD;
of the gilded alcoves which encircled the hall, s&#xD;
to rest. All was gaiety, life, and splendor.r&#xD;
A myriad of lights blazed in glittering chan- a&#xD;
deliers suspended from the exquisitely painted s&#xD;
ceiling, and diamonds added their lustre to b&#xD;
the splendor of the scene. There were masks&#xD;
of every description, from the plain black or 1&#xD;
orange-colored domino to the regal robes ofr&#xD;
an Emperor ; from the simple flower girl anda&#xD;
gypsy to the duchess in diadem. Moorish t&#xD;
slaves jostled European Kings, and demure (&#xD;
nuns flirted with ferocious- looking Turkish t&#xD;
Sultans. Harlequins jested with friars, and&#xD;
friars promenaded arin in arm with his satan-&#xD;
ic majesty. There were Cupids .with silver&#xD;
wings flutting about crying 'hearts to sell,'&#xD;
and a roguish Hymen enthroned upon an altar&#xD;
with a burning torch in one hand and a gold-&#xD;
en chain in the other, proclaiming aloud. his&#xD;
willingness to bind together all who chose to&#xD;
kneel at his shrine.I&#xD;
-On entering this scene Emme fell behind a&#xD;
step in her character as a slave ; and Geor-&#xD;
giana leaning on the arm of her noble lover,&#xD;
with &amp;amp; heart full of happiness. throbbing be-&#xD;
neath her jewelled vestment, walked up the&#xD;
thronged hall. The height and manly figure&#xD;
of Florence, the stately grace of Georgiana&#xD;
combined with the dazzling splendor of their&#xD;
costume and the attendant slave, soon drew&#xD;
many eyes upon them, even in a crowd where&#xD;
there was so much-to attract attention. Those&#xD;
before them gave way involuntarily for them&#xD;
as if before a royal pair, and the whisper and&#xD;
remark of admiration flew from lip to lip. The&#xD;
throng opened before them only to close up&#xD;
behind them after they had passed and follow&#xD;
in their train. Florence felt that this homage&#xD;
was 'commanded by the superb beauty 'of&#xD;
Georgiana alone, and he took- a pride in pass-&#xD;
ing on and suffering the crowd to yield her&#xD;
that homage which was her right. The beau-&#xD;
tiful Emme escaped-not her share of praise;&#xD;
for such modesty combined with elegance in&#xD;
her air, such neatness yet r-ichness of costume,&#xD;
contributed .to make her an object of at-&#xD;
traction. The three so perfect and appropi-&#xD;

'om every mouth.&#xD;
Florence, proud of the admiration she ex-&#xD;
ited would lead Georgiana notwithstanding&#xD;
er remonstrances the whole length of the hall,&#xD;
here to his surprise, was a sort of throne,&#xD;
bove which was suspended a canopy of oil-&#xD;
er. Before he was aware several knights&#xD;
receded by a herald pressed forward from&#xD;
he throng as if by one impulse, and the Her-&#xD;
Id lifting his trumpet to his mouth blew three&#xD;
lasts which rose far above the loud music of&#xD;
he orchestra and the sound of the dancers&#xD;
eet,&#xD;
' This throne is erected for the King of&#xD;
Chivalry and the Queen of Beauty! Hitherto&#xD;
here hath appeared none to claim it. But&#xD;
ere we hail thee King of Chivalry and thee&#xD;
Queen of Beauty! Ascend and occupy the&#xD;
hrone !&#xD;
Before Georgiana could recover from her&#xD;
urprise at this simultaneous and impulsive&#xD;
movement of the masked throng, a knight in&#xD;
a silver casque had led her to the throne and&#xD;
eated her upon it and another Kni'ght in*a&#xD;
black visor had conducted and placed by -her&#xD;
side the equally surprised Florence. But en-&#xD;
tering into the spirit of the scene, they both&#xD;
rose and graciously bowed to those around in&#xD;
acknowledgment of the honor conferred upon&#xD;
them, while Emme, in her character of a Cir-&#xD;
cassian slave, seated herself in a graceful at.&#xD;
titude upon the footstool with her hands&#xD;
crossed upon her bosom.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
The Convent-The Padre-The Conversation&#xD;
overheard by Louisette recorded-The Con-&#xD;
spiracy against M. Florence Noel.&#xD;
WE will now return to Don Rafael and&#xD;
Benito, the cabaret keeper, whom we left cross-&#xD;
in the deserted, grass-grown court of the&#xD;
oil Convent towards the portal which stood&#xD;
about seventy feet back from the street wall.&#xD;
its gray stuccoed front, moulded with rust&#xD;
and age, with its heavy cornices and massive&#xD;
pilasters reared itself gloomily above their&#xD;
heads as they came under the arched entrance.&#xD;
This was open, as if left so night and day, foi&#xD;
a common passage. In it hung An iron latnp&#xD;
which shed a dull light around and served to&#xD;
expose a vestibule from which ascended a&#xD;
broad flight of stairs, so wide and shallow'that&#xD;
one on horseback could easily have ascended&#xD;
them. Opposite the foot of the stairs the head&#xD;
of which was lost in perfect darkness, we6&#xD;
two or three, doors and an open passage, the&#xD;
extremity of which was in darkness. ' he as-&#xD;
pect of all around was cheerless ; and' the&#xD;
cold pavement and the damp air of the night&#xD;
added to its dreary character. Save the pre-&#xD;
sence of the lamp burning there were no signs&#xD;

of the vast and ruinous mansion being inha-&#xD;
bited.&#xD;
'Whither do you conduct me, Benito?' de-&#xD;
manded the young Spaniard stopping full at&#xD;
the bottom of the dark stairs, upon which the&#xD;
cabaretier had placed his foot in the act of as-&#xD;
cending. 1I must know before I.go further.&#xD;
This old nunnery may be the resort of ban-&#xD;
'Do not fear, Senor,' replied Benito with a&#xD;
tone outwardly respectful, but which conceal-&#xD;
ed a vein of contempt. 'I told you in my&#xD;
cabaret that I knew well a good Padre who&#xD;
could assist you in- your matter and would&#xD;
cond uct-you to him, where we could talk over&#xD;
the subject without interruption. . The Padre&#xD;
dwells in this convent  You mistrust me,&#xD;
Don Rafael.. But so long as your gold is free-&#xD;
ly given, I shall be true to you. This and not&#xD;
friendship binds us together!'&#xD;
'Together! Do you dare speak of me in this&#xD;
union   haughtily cried the Spaniard.&#xD;
This is no place nor time to quarrel about&#xD;
words, Don Rafael. Will you follow me,&#xD;
or shall I return to my cabaret ."&#xD;
' Proceed!' answered the young man in a&#xD;
brief tone.&#xD;
The cabaretier mounted the broad stairs to&#xD;
the second floor of the convent, and entered&#xD;
upon a vestibule, from which diverged pas-&#xD;
sages to different parts of the building. The&#xD;
place where they stood was perfectly dark,&#xD;
save a faint glimmer that reached it from the&#xD;
lamp hung below.&#xD;
h Father Fausto's cell is in this direction, to&#xD;
the left, senor,' said Benito. 'If you will&#xD;
take hold of my cloak I will guide you. The&#xD;
padre rarely has visitors, and does not keep&#xD;
lights in his passage; and those wro come to&#xD;
see him can usually find their way in the dark.&#xD;
The lamp below is lighted by the portiere at&#xD;
the gate, who has several apartments under&#xD;
her charge below us on the rez do c/ausee,&#xD;
let out to persons for various purposes.'&#xD;
'Then the convent is inhabited ?' said Don&#xD;
Rafael with more confidence.&#xD;
'Yes. There are two maitres d'Ecole who&#xD;
occupy rooms here for their pupils in the day&#xD;
time. But there is my cloak, cape to hold&#xD;
by.'&#xD;
'No. Lead on! Your footsteps will guide&#xD;
me.&#xD;
Benito moved on through the impenetrable&#xD;
darkness for sorne distance, closely followed&#xD;
by Don Rafael, who occasionally muttered a&#xD;
deep curse as lie came in contact with the&#xD;
damp wall, or struck his feet against a loose&#xD;
tile. After walking a few yards they turned&#xD;
an angle of the passage and entered another&#xD;
much narrower, but equally dark. The cab-&#xD;
aretier walked firmly and confidently on; but&#xD;
Don Rafael felt his way by the sides and ad-&#xD;
vanced like a man blind-folded. Benito had&#xD;
got some paces before him and he heard him&#xD;
rap twice sharply upon a door, and then after&#xD;
a moment give a single rap. The door was&#xD;
instantly opened and the lare of a light issu-&#xD;
ing forth guided Don Rafae to the cell.-&#xD;
&#xD;
'Felices . noches, Senor Padre,' said Be-&#xD;
nito to a tall. thin-man in a long coarse black&#xD;
gown girdled by a belt of shining black leath-&#xD;
er about his waist, who had opened the door&#xD;
to him. 'I have come with a friend to see you&#xD;
on business. Are you engaged?'&#xD;
' No, Senor,' answered the Padre in a voice,&#xD;
of singular depth. 'Enter you and your&#xD;
friend.'&#xD;
Don Rafael followed his guide into the cell&#xD;
when the Padre closed the door and pointed&#xD;
each of them to a seat on low stools, himself&#xD;
occupying a carved chair ofvery ancient ap-&#xD;
pearance that was placed beneath' a little&#xD;
book-case. On one side of him stood a rude&#xD;
narrow bed of moes, and on the other a small&#xD;
round stand on which was a crucifix, a metal&#xD;
lamp, a rosary, and a missal much finger worn.&#xD;
On the book which was open lay a pair of&#xD;
iron rimmed spectacles. There were no oth-&#xD;
er articles in the room save a monk's broad&#xD;
hat for the street, and a penetential whip com-&#xD;
posed ofseven small knotted cords.&#xD;
Don Rafael seated himself, humble as the&#xD;
seat was, in silence, and then fixed his eyes&#xD;
steadily upon the Padre. He was a man&#xD;
about fifty, with a high, stately looking fore-&#xD;
head shaded with gray hair. His brows were&#xD;
sharply arched and severe, and his dark gray&#xD;
eyes were penetrating and stern. His nose&#xD;
was high bridged and Roman, and his mouth&#xD;
thin and expressive of a character proud and&#xD;
avaricious. It wore, as if habitually, a covert&#xD;
smile lurking in its sharp corners--a- smile&#xD;
dangerous and treacherous. His complexion&#xD;
was sallow, his eyes sunken beneath his&#xD;
brows like dark pools beneath gloomy arch-&#xD;
es; and he was without a beard The sin-&#xD;
ister and cunning expression of his mouth&#xD;
could not, however, destroy a certain air of in-&#xD;
telligence and education which his counte-&#xD;
nance manifested.&#xD;
it is a chilly evening abroad, senor,' he&#xD;
said speaking in the Castillian tongue and ad-&#xD;
dressing Dan Rafael whom he saw closely en.&#xD;
gaged scanning his countenance, and whose&#xD;
attention he seemed desirous of averting; 'I&#xD;
am sorry I have no fire to offer you.'&#xD;
' It is of no consequence, senor Padre,' ans-&#xD;
wered Valdes ; 'the air of your chamber is&#xD;
agreeable, though something close.' Don Ra.&#xD;
iael than glanced at Benito impatiently, as if&#xD;
desirous he should make known to the father&#xD;
his business. Benito, however was too devout-&#xD;
ly engaged to heed the sign. He had no&#xD;
sooner taken off his cloak and Sombrero than&#xD;
he fell on his knees before the crucifix and tak-&#xD;
ing up the Rosary began crossing himself and&#xD;
telling the beads with most commendable zeal&#xD;
muttering all the while prayers, which seem-&#xD;
ed to ibsue from the great mouth in his enor-&#xD;
mous head, as if from a cavern. The light of&#xD;
the lamp shed a strong 1 ght upon his 'gigan--&#xD;
tic forehead and strong features; and gave&#xD;
him a look at once hideous and .awe-inspiring.&#xD;
Don Rafael watched him with imuriosity. A fter&#xD;
he had ceased he rose and kuelt by the Padre's&#xD;
knee :                       .      .&#xD;

on you, Benito, to see that I am served in this&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
The cabaret-keeper was for a few moments&#xD;
silent and thoughtful. Don Rafael watched&#xD;
his face closely. Louisette, at her listening&#xD;
post in her room, trembled with fear and hor-&#xD;
ror!&#xD;
It is a grave affair, Dor Rafael. Besides&#xD;
I know M. Noel, senior, though I have not&#xD;
seen him on account of his -illnes for some&#xD;
years. I bought of him the handsome mu.&#xD;
latress slave Teresa who is my housekeeper,&#xD;
and whom you saw in the cabaret to-night.&#xD;
Hermother was a noble-looking quadroone,&#xD;
almost white- and a, perfect devil for Malice.&#xD;
M. Noel gave her up to the police as he sus-&#xD;
peeted her, it is said of having poisoned his&#xD;
wife who die4 suddenly. Yes, I well remem-&#xD;

When do you wish me to undertake it?'&#xD;
Thiasvery niglit.'&#xD;
It is soon.'&#xD;
The time is favorable. There is to be held&#xD;
in the grande salon of the Hotel St. Louis,&#xD;
as you know, a masquerade -of a brilliant des-&#xD;
cription.  I have satisfactorily ascertained&#xD;
from various squroes that M. Noel is to be&#xD;
there. His costume I am ignorant of. But I&#xD;
caught a glimpse of his vesture when he res-&#xD;
cued the quadroone I was taking home with&#xD;
me on horseback, his loak falling aside,, and&#xD;
I saw an emerald sparkling on a golden breast&#xD;
plate!. By this I should recognise him!'&#xD;
And what use could I make of it?&#xD;
You must take a mask and domino and&#xD;
proceed with me to the bal masque. You see&#xD;
my costume is that of an Italian cavalier.&#xD;
You can keep me in sight in the Salon and&#xD;
I will point out to you the emerald breast-&#xD;
plate. eTh  ewels he wears, if you do your&#xD;
work secretly and well, will be your own.&#xD;

I s4uld man ige this according to. your plan,&#xD;

h      'Yo~u are rih. It would compromise. me&#xD;

with a look of intense disappointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Cannot you lie in wait for him. Cannotyou&#xD;
fall upon' him in the street!'&#xD;
Benito made no reply. He sat with his&#xD;
head supported on his hand in deep reflec-&#xD;
tion. He seemed to have got possession of&#xD;
a new view of the subject which he was at-&#xD;
tentively considering. Don Rafael sat in si-&#xD;
lence regarding him with eager expression&#xD;
upon his countenance. At length the cab-&#xD;
aretier spoke in a low, impressive voice;&#xD;
'You say all your desire is to remove your&#xD;
rival M. Florence Noel?',&#xD;
' All. So that I may be the only suiter,&#xD;
and win the object of my passion; who will&#xD;
then without donbt, be true to me ! While he&#xD;
is living I have no hope of success.'&#xD;
You mean while she regards him with&#xD;
tenderness?'&#xD;
'It is the same thing.'&#xD;
Not quite. For she may be brought to&#xD;
scorn him.'&#xD;
'How?' he demanded eagerly.&#xD;
'Would that be as effectual, Don Ra-&#xD;
fael? Truth is I have repugnance to blood-&#xD;
shedding of late. It costs me a good deal in&#xD;
penance and confession,'and I begin to feel&#xD;
pious inclinations as I get older. If I ani a&#xD;
monster on earth I dont mean also to be a dev-&#xD;
il in hell! Perhaps we can get rid of this M.&#xD;
Noel without the knife.&#xD;
'In what manner? The stiletto is always&#xD;
safest, Senor del Carbaret.'&#xD;
' You care little about blood, Don Rafael,&#xD;
so your own fingers dont get the stain upon&#xD;
them. But it is one thing to pay the gold,&#xD;
and another to drive the steel!'&#xD;
hIt is your trade,' answered Don . Rafael&#xD;
haughtily.&#xD;
'Do you sayIthat word to me. Senor&#xD;
Valdes?' demanded Benito fiercely. '1 am&#xD;
as well born as thou? my trade ! It is my hu-&#xD;
mor-!'&#xD;
'Be it thy humor then to serve this M. No-&#xD;

I again ask you, Don Rafael,' he said im-&#xD;
pressively, tif by any mea s this maiden be&#xD;

you yourself, and all men may scorn and&#xD;

as to fly the face of the society in which he&#xD;
now mingles, will this result answer your&#xD;
wishes? or must you have his life?'&#xD;
'No. If you can do this that you mention,&#xD;
let him live! I would rather see him degrad-&#xD;
ed, so as to be ignominiously cast off by her,&#xD;
than behold him lying dead at my feet.' You&#xD;

' Be it so,' answered Valdes in no pleasant&#xD;
hunor.&#xD;
'Have you the fifty onzas of gold with you,&#xD;
Don Rafael  asked Benito, extending his&#xD;
thin shrivelled hand.'&#xD;
' Do you take me for a voiturier, senor de&#xD;
cabaret, that I muet carry such a sack of coin&#xD;
with me?'         '~&#xD;
' Excuse me, Senor! But, as you came&#xD;
here on this especial matter, I concluded you&#xD;
came provided.'&#xD;
'I have but a few pesos about me.'&#xD;
'I cannot divulge my plan for your success&#xD;
and M. Florence Noel's ruin without the fifty&#xD;
onzas in hand,' answered Benito firmly.&#xD;
'Hombre maldito!' cried Valdes, rising up&#xD;
and stamping, with his foot. 'Do you excite&#xD;
my hopes to mock them?'&#xD;
' No, Senor! This is an affair of money-a&#xD;
business matter altogether. For the same&#xD;
amount of money I would let M. Noel change&#xD;
places with you, and plot with him against&#xD;
you.'&#xD;
'You are a finished malechero, Benito!'&#xD;
exclaimed Valdes with angry vehemence.&#xD;
' Worda move me not. Return to your ca-&#xD;
sa, Don Rafael, if it please you, and bring me&#xD;
the money and I will then reveal my secret.'&#xD;
Valdes saw that Benito was firm; and after&#xD;
biting his lips witn vexation, he said-&#xD;
'If you deceive me at last, you shall not&#xD;
escape my resentment. I go for the gold,&#xD;
and will return in half an hour. I have to&#xD;
revisit my house to dress for the masquerade.'&#xD;
'Then I shall expect you and will be ready&#xD;
for you. Perhaps you might as well return&#xD;
in a carriage, as we shall have some distance&#xD;
to go to the priest's.. I do not fear your re-&#xD;
sentment. I shall succeed!'&#xD;
'If you do, Benito, I shall willingly add ten&#xD;
to the fifty onzas.'a&#xD;
The cabaretier then let Don Rafael out of&#xD;
the porte de la Rue, and securing it after him,&#xD;
soon after re-entered his cabaret, as we have&#xD;
already seen ; while Louisette shook her pret-&#xD;
ty little head and rubbed her neat round ears,&#xD;
and said with a sigh,&#xD;
'Ah, what a nice secret I have missed hear-&#xD;
ing, just because that evil-minded Spaniard&#xD;
had'nt fifty gold onzas about him. I would&#xD;
rather have given it than lost the secret.-&#xD;
But I'll keep watch in the cabaret for his re-&#xD;
turn, and then see what I can discover.-&#xD;
With this to look after, and my Louis to keep&#xD;
an eye on, who is going to-night to the mas-&#xD;
querade on purpose to see some lovely girl&#xD;
he fell in love with, I have enough to do.-&#xD;
Ah, Louis! you dont know while you are in&#xD;
the cabaret drinking wine with your friends,&#xD;
that I have slipped out and got a gendarme to&#xD;
secure me a ticket, and that I shall be there&#xD;
too! I inust know who this pretty Creole is,&#xD;
who is tempting you to run away from me to-&#xD;
night, to the bal masque ! You don't know&#xD;
that good Teresa here told me all about it ;&#xD;
and how she heard it from her gossip, whose&#xD;
&#xD;
mistress keeps the magazine de coutume,&#xD;
where he went in and saw this pretty lady&#xD;
selecting her dress, and put so many ques-&#xD;
tions after she went out about her !-earned&#xD;
how she was going to the masquerade in the&#xD;
costume of a Circassian slave, and then or-&#xD;
dered of the marc/and, the husband of the&#xD;
marchande de coutume, who had a magazine&#xD;
above stairs, the magnificent costume of a&#xD;
Georgian prince! Ah, he does not know I&#xD;
know it all so nicely! I shall be avenged&#xD;
on him, the truant and false Louis!'&#xD;
With this resolution Louisette followed&#xD;
after Benito into the cabaret. The reader&#xD;
will recollect that when Don Rafael returned&#xD;
to the cabaret he came on horseback accom-&#xD;
panied by his servant dressed in all points&#xD;
like himself as an Italian cavalier; and that&#xD;
atter speaking with Benito and assuring him&#xD;
that his servant had the gold on the saddle,&#xD;
lie had torn off Louisette's mask, who was&#xD;
watching him with the secretintention of fol-&#xD;
lowing him and Benito, and lifting her upon&#xD;
his horse had borne her off.,&#xD;
Before entering the convent gate with Be-&#xD;
nito, on his arrival there after Louisette's res-&#xD;
cue, he took the bag of gold from his servant&#xD;
and silently placed it in the hands of the cab-&#xD;
aretier, who, satisfied with its weight, preced-&#xD;
ed him, as we have seen, into the convent,&#xD;
and to the cell of the padre Fausto, where&#xD;
we will once more resume our narrative.&#xD;
The preceding digressive retrospection has&#xD;
given the reader some idea of the character of&#xD;
the priest Fausto, within whose presence Don&#xD;
Rafael now found himself.&#xD;
' I have heard of Don Rafael Valdes,' said&#xD;
the padre, when Benito had named him; 'I&#xD;
am at the service of the senor.'&#xD;
' How you can be of service to me senor Pa-&#xD;
dre, is more than I can tell,' answered Don&#xD;
Rafael with haughty impatience; 'for I am&#xD;
quite ignorant of the object for which Benito&#xD;
Soto has seen fit to brlnz me hither!'&#xD;
'You shall not be anj longer left in igno-&#xD;
rance, Don Rafael,1 said Aenito.  A  few&#xD;
words will explain to the father your position,&#xD;
and then we can see how to arrange matters.'&#xD;
Benito then briefly, and without the least&#xD;
disguise or concealment, made the priest ac-&#xD;
quainted with the state of affairs touching the&#xD;
passion of Don Rafael and the rivalship of&#xD;
Florence Noel, and his desire to have, him&#xD;
quietly put out of the way, that he might be&#xD;
the sole object of the lady's favor. Don Ra-&#xD;
fael stood by listening with ,impatience, and&#xD;
to do himcredit, not without a sense of shame&#xD;
aud degradation, at this recapitulation by a&#xD;
third party, of his own infamous and secret&#xD;
designs. However, in his breast vengeance&#xD;
was stronger than any other feeling. When&#xD;
Benito had ended, the priest remained in the&#xD;
same attitude in which he had been giving his&#xD;
attention; his elbow restipig on an arm ol the&#xD;
chair, and the point of his fore-finger support-&#xD;
ing his chin. Both observed his countenance&#xD;
closely. At length he spoke, his features ex-&#xD;
pressive of a sinister pleasure:&#xD;
&#xD;
'And you declined assassinating, Senor'&#xD;
Soto,'he remarked in a doubtful tone.&#xD;
Yes, Senor Padre. I have had enough of&#xD;
blood,' answered the Carbaratier in a peni-&#xD;
tential voice.&#xD;
'And therefore you have come to me! !Do&#xD;
you think I am  an assassin, hombre?' de-&#xD;
manded the priest sternly.&#xD;
"No, Senor Padre! I have come to see you&#xD;
to avoid bloodshed. I have a plan in my&#xD;
head.'&#xD;
'Your head hath capacity to hold a great&#xD;
many plans, Don Benito,' said the priest, his&#xD;
features relaxing into a smile.&#xD;
Benito smiled ; but his eyes also flashed fire.&#xD;
He, however, was silent; while the Padre, as&#xD;
if to mollify him; said,&#xD;
'1 meant no offence, good Benito. I did&#xD;
but have reference to your great wisdom and&#xD;
sagacity. What is this plan?'&#xD;
'When Don Rafael made known his af-&#xD;
fair to me in the cabaret, a thought struck&#xD;
me! The young woman Teresa, my house-&#xD;
keeper, was once a slave of M. Noel the sen-&#xD;
ior, of whom I purchased her. Her mother&#xD;
was M. Noel's nurse for his two children,&#xD;
and she was after the death of his wife, Mad.&#xD;
ame Noel, surrendered by him to the PoliE&#xD;
on suspicion of having poisoned her mistress&#xD;
She was acquitted and afterwards came ofter&#xD;
to my cabaret to see her daughter; and a&#xD;
such times, I recollected, having heard he&#xD;
boast that her daughter Teresa was the chili&#xD;
of M. Noel.',&#xD;
'It is not probable,' said the Padre wh&#xD;
had listened with attention. 'M. Noel is&#xD;
fair man, and your Teresa is a bright malat&#xD;
ress.'&#xD;
'I did not, nor do I believe it, Senor  Pa&#xD;
dre. But out of this hen's egg I have hatch&#xD;
ed a young serpent. It bethought me, a&#xD;
Don Rafael was opening his affair to me&#xD;
that all he wanted was to get M. Florence&#xD;
his rival, out of the way; and that so it wer&#xD;
done, it would be the same to him whether&#xD;
were 4one with steel or cunning ! This h&#xD;
acknowledged, when I asked him if he woul&#xD;
be content with the infamy of his rival.'&#xD;
'And how we're you to effect this, wise Be&#xD;
nito ?' asked the priest.&#xD;
'1 got my hint from Lucrece, the qua&#xD;
roone mother's boast about Teresa being th&#xD;
daughter of M. Noel.'&#xD;
*-I dont see what connection there is here&#xD;
said father Fausto.  .&#xD;
'Nor, by the mass! do I,' exclaimed Do&#xD;
Rafael strongly.&#xD;
Benito smiled triumphantly, and then pr&#xD;
ceeded in a tone of hellish exultation lookir&#xD;
at each as he spoke ;_&#xD;
'I said to myself in my thoughts, though&#xD;
Teresa may not be the daughter of M. Noe&#xD;
FLORENCE NOEL may be the son of Lueree&#xD;
the quadroone!'&#xD;
For a few seconds a strange silence su&#xD;
ceeded the development of' this bold anda&#xD;
tounding idea of the Deformed !The prie&#xD;
looked at him with an expression of amaze&#xD;

&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
ment and admiration at a piece of devilish in-&#xD;
vention so infinitely transcending an  thing&#xD;
-he, himself, with all his subtlety could frame.&#xD;
Don Rafael gazed upon the speaker with a&#xD;
bewildered and vacant look, as if something&#xD;
vast and startling had been suggested, the&#xD;
breadth and extent of which his mind had&#xD;
not yet fully cokoprehended. A moment he&#xD;
remained so; and then all at once the full&#xD;
force of Benito's meaning flashed upon his&#xD;
mind.' He sprung forward and struck his&#xD;
hand into the palm of the Cabaretier, and&#xD;
cried.&#xD;
' Thou hast a master-spirit, good Benito&#xD;
Thou shalt have thy fifty onzas made a hun-&#xD;
dred, and the priest have his twenty five,&#xD;
doubled, if thou succeed in carrying out this&#xD;
scheme. 'Twas forrhed in hell and conceived&#xD;
by Lucifer! Brave Benito, thou hast a rare&#xD;
brain.'&#xD;
'Did I not tell thee that my egg would hatch&#xD;
a serpent.'&#xD;
S '.It is a serpent that will strangle this Flo-&#xD;
rence Noel if thou canst bring him within its&#xD;
r folds,' said Valdes, his eyes flashing with ma-&#xD;
licious triumph, as he paced with quick,&#xD;
- short steps up and down the cell. 'But how&#xD;
e wilt thou carry out thy plot.'&#xD;
. Even so, good Benito! how wilt thou&#xD;
n make this serpent bite!' asked the priest.&#xD;
t   ' My plan, as you have divined, is to endea-&#xD;
r vor to prove M. Florence the son of the quad-&#xD;
d roone Lucrece.'&#xD;
' A difficult matter to prove, Benito,' said&#xD;
o the Padre shaking his head, doubtfully.&#xD;
a ' Not with thy wit to help mine, good father,'&#xD;
answered the cabaretier confidently' Don&#xD;
Rafael hath pledged me one hundred onzas and&#xD;
- yourself, fifty, if this thing succeeds. For&#xD;
- this sum, which is not found under every&#xD;
s loose stone, you will no doubt do your best.'&#xD;
,    ' Let me first hear your project.'&#xD;
, 'It is this. Lucrece must be brought into&#xD;

WE will now return to ,Loise'te,: who, it&#xD;
will be remembered, after her rectle by Flo-&#xD;
rence from the hands of Valdes, we left on&#xD;
her return towards the cabaret with Louis, who&#xD;
had early made his appearance, and received&#xD;
her from her respqer with many expressions&#xD;
of ranly gratitude. With thiq young ,man,&#xD;
we have not yet made the,.reader fullyou-&#xD;
quainted. We have described Ahim as ab-ld,&#xD;
handsome dissipated person, with flowing&#xD;
brown locks, a fine clear eye, and an expres-&#xD;
sion full of a generous frankness and open,&#xD;
daring., .His person was a little undersized&#xD;
but compactly knit together,:and Lhis costume&#xD;
that of a sailor, with pretensions to nautical&#xD;
foppery;- manifested ini his numerous finger&#xD;
rings; his laced ruffles and worked linen; his&#xD;
showy and, costly roach, and gold chains&#xD;
flashing across his breast. - The knife which&#xD;
had lai'bepide him on the table in thecabaret&#xD;
was now, as lie walked by the aideof Lousi&#xD;
ette, sheathed in a red silk sash that was worn&#xD;
about his Waist after ,the fashion of Spanish&#xD;
sailpra,, though his language and.features were&#xD;
those of a' Boston-boy,ias ,such he was. He&#xD;
belonged to a distinguished family, in: the&#xD;
vicinity of Boston whose name is identified&#xD;
With that of the earlier colonial history,, and&#xD;
which gained now lustre in the war of the&#xD;
revolution. His father was a wealthy ,land-&#xD;
proprietPr,,. nd- Lois whom  we'-will call&#xD;
Louis Wildbirdv or ,.il1 Pirata' by -which naie&#xD;
he was-better known, being a lover of plea-&#xD;
sure,, pursued her with such zeal that his&#xD;
father after advancing several large sums to&#xD;
free him.from difficulties ito which his reck-&#xD;
less follies hadplaced-him, disgraced him, by&#xD;
closing his door against him. , Louis wient to&#xD;
sea, and made avoyagre to India,. On his return&#xD;
his father-met hin and, restored him to favor.&#xD;
But the youag lni's habits had not been na-&#xD;
terially improved, by,'year's'life before the&#xD;
mast; and, his father indulging him, in some&#xD;
atonement for his pastseverity, lie soon began&#xD;
a career of fashionable and expensive luxury&#xD;
that brought upon him the .paternal reproof&#xD;
and a threat to disinherit him. But Louis&#xD;
laughed at. -he menace, and -trusting to- his&#xD;
father's clemency and knowing his wealth he,&#xD;
like manyoth.er heirs of rich men, expended&#xD;
money as freely as'tver. At length his father&#xD;
was taken sick and Louis hastened to his bed-&#xD;
side ; forwith all-his thoughtless exttiavagance&#xD;
and gaiety of career, he was attached to hin-.&#xD;
He only .differed with hinm .in opinion, as he&#xD;
said ; ' his father wishing to keep- his fortune&#xD;
for him to spend after his death;- he, himself,&#xD;
preferringg to use it before !'a it Was this slight&#xD;
difference of opinion that rhade all, the diffi-&#xD;

&#xD;
found hiin quite ill; and watched by his bed-&#xD;
side with, filial tenderness until hefdied.- He.I&#xD;
was now master of his fortune! This was his&#xD;
first thought after he had shed a due number&#xD;
'of tears. T he will wasatleagt opened, and&#xD;
it'read as follows:&#xD;
'Whereas, my son Louis,' has  en fitto&#xD;
anticipate his fortune while in his minority,&#xD;
and by the manner in which ho has expended&#xD;
nearly the sum of fifty thousand dollars with-&#xD;
in the last three years, hasshown me how he&#xD;

a blue cover and addressed to Louis Wildbird,&#xD;
to be found in my secretary,' to. the --&#xD;
Hospital for its own proper use forever.'&#xD;
Louis was confounded as well he might be;&#xD;
and for a few moments remained a statue of&#xD;
silent astonishment and horror. - The old gen&#xD;
tleman.hadT'airly avenged himself!&#xD;
'Perhaps it would be as well to examine&#xD;
the blue box,' said th'e attorney who had read&#xD;
the Will.&#xD;
With. a faint hope that it might contain some-&#xD;
thing to cancel this terrible sentence, .for he&#xD;
could not believe that his father. could have&#xD;
been-serious,he flew to' the secretary.' The-&#xD;
blue box was there, and -addressed to him in&#xD;
his fathers hand-writing;' which being hold&#xD;
and firm showed that it had been written be&#xD;
fore he was taken ill. The key was - inthe&#xD;
lock. He. turned it with a trembling hand&#xD;
and lifted the lid. It contained four parcels&#xD;
nicely done up in brown-paper and superscrib-&#xD;
ed to himself.&#xD;
lie opened one-the smallest. Its contents&#xD;
were apair of dice! He dropped them with&#xD;
a misgiving that something worse would fol-&#xD;
low!&#xD;
He opened the second parcel.' It contained&#xD;
pair of spurs!&#xD;
Quietlyher put them with the .dice and tore&#xD;
open the third package. 11, contained a hal-&#xD;
-ter'&#xD;
Giving utterance to a deep execration he&#xD;
dashed the box, upon: the floor. The fourth&#xD;
parcel fell at his feet! 'He tOok it up, as it was&#xD;
in the shape of letter.  He tore t open and&#xD;
read as follows:&#xD;

note tp his comsaprjg officer tendering his&#xD;
resignation. -Instead of being accepted, a&#xD;
sentence of dis raceful dismission from the&#xD;
navy was passe upon him. Reckless and out&#xD;
of employment, Louis, who had escape  infm&#xD;
Mahon to Gibraltar in a Spanish coaster after&#xD;
the fatal duel, associated hiuseif with aptr, y&#xD;
of desperate men who had laid a pla&#xD;

men and an Englishman among them, Tfior-&#xD;
oughly acquainted with the Spanish language&#xD;
Louis attached himself to these men, wo&#xD;
were twenty in number, and with thembhoard-&#xD;
ed the ship, drove the crew into the water,&#xD;
and robbed ,her of a large amount of specie&#xD;
and gold and silver in ingots. They escaped&#xD;

Several of the robbers werearrested'; but&#xD;
Louis escaped by means of a British' vessel in&#xD;

and sailed for New Orleans. Here, instead&#xD;
of expending his' gold in diesipation, fav-&#xD;
ing formeda romantic idea f beig master of&#xD;
his own craft on the sea, he looked about him&#xD;
for a light vessel that would answer his pur-&#xD;

rived from Cuba withacargo of 'fruit. 'Te&#xD;

had men of other nations, who were as in-&#xD;
different for what end they were* shipped as&#xD;
Louis could desire. It was during this search&#xD;
after a crew that he fell in with the hand-.&#xD;
some Quadroone Louisette. He was return-&#xD;
ing one night to his lodgmns which were&#xD;
lien, ats now, with Bienito, whom he had taken&#xD;
intohis confidence and who was of great as-&#xD;
sistance in getting him proper men, when as he&#xD;
was passing up Rue Toulouse he was assault-&#xD;
ed fromnbehind and felled insensible upon the&#xD;
pavement. When he recovered his conscious-&#xD;
ness he found that be was lying upon a couch&#xD;
inr a handsome apartment'and in attendance'&#xD;
'pon.ht.hm was a young' girl of remarkable&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
must not move, Monsieur,' she said&#xD;
with a smile of pleasure on seeing him sen-&#xD;
sible. ' Lay still and sleep'now that you are&#xD;
better and I will watch by you!'&#xD;
It was with great difficulty Louis could&#xD;
convince her that he wasentirely restored, and&#xD;
elt no further efects from the bow he had&#xD;
received, thena head, ache.- When she was&#xD;
satisfied of this she began to put up to heaven&#xD;
a hundred ejaculations of gratitude, and look-&#xD;
ed so beautiful and bewithing that Louis&#xD;
could not resist the impulse to catch her in&#xD;
his arms and warmly kiss her red lips. She&#xD;
escaped from him laughing; and then told&#xD;
him how she had heard him groan as she was&#xD;
shutting her door, and went to him and see-&#xD;
ing that he was hurt had made her negro&#xD;
woman help her bring him in. Louis then&#xD;
looked round and saw a black female with a&#xD;
red and yellow handkerchief bound on her&#xD;
head seated on a cricket at the foot of the&#xD;
couch. 'So we brought you in and laid you&#xD;
on the couch, and did every thimg for you to&#xD;
bring you to, because Ikhnew you, though&#xD;

said laughing, be&#xD;
MoOh yes, monsieur! When I saw you pass&#xD;
the fIrst time I took a pleasure i remember-&#xD;
ing your face, and when you came by again&#xD;
and again, I put on my mantilla and followed&#xD;
and iquired, ad so you see I found you out !&#xD;
And when I saw that it was you who was&#xD;
hurt I felt so sorry, and had you at once&#xD;
brought into the house; and now you are bat-&#xD;
ter I am not sorry anylonger, but happy that&#xD;
weh e become acquainted.'&#xD;

n   wousess of the young girl, who not-&#xD;

II&#xD;
i1&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
withstanding her beauty and the brightness of&#xD;
her complekion, Louis knew t'o be a quadroon,&#xD;
deepened the impression her charms had made&#xD;
upon him. :In a word, he had been robbed of&#xD;
his purse of gold outside of the house, and: he&#xD;
was robbed of his hmrt on the inside. "The&#xD;
first robber fled ath, 'escaped; but to this he&#xD;
felt he (vould willingly sutrender himself. On&#xD;
inquiring he learned that she-was just-seven-&#xD;
teen, was, heart-free, and lived with a sister&#xD;
who was a marchande de boucles and had her'&#xD;
shop up stairs.&#xD;
Louis returned to his. lonely apartment in&#xD;
the cabaret, but every day he called in to pay&#xD;
Madamoiselle Louisette a -visit; and finally&#xD;
by means of i treaty made with her sister, the&#xD;
marchande of curls, he transferred the pretty&#xD;
quadroon from Rue Toulouse to his own&#xD;
quarters. A few days afterwards Louis sailed&#xD;
from port taking the' happy Louisette with&#xD;
him. He 'cleared for Vera Ciuz in ' ballast,&#xD;
having his guns in the hold. His crew con-&#xD;
sisted of forty two men, most of them young&#xD;
men; and a more bold and daring company&#xD;
were never assembled on the deck of a vessel&#xD;
under the burthen of a hundred tons. On&#xD;
reaching the Balise and getting an offing,&#xD;
Louis run up for the Breton Isles and there&#xD;
anchoring in  secluded inlet, mounted his&#xD;
carronades and long gun, and then mounting&#xD;
himself upon the top of his twenty four&#xD;
pounder, made the following speech to his&#xD;
men:&#xD;
' My lads, I have shipped you for a cruise.&#xD;
Some of you no doubt think you are going to&#xD;
fight the Texans. But you are very much&#xD;
mistaken. I wouldn't lift a finger against the&#xD;
little Republic. All of you who are of the&#xD;
same mind give three cheers for the Lone&#xD;
Star and take your time from me!'&#xD;
About two thirds of his men joined him&#xD;
with a w'll. Those who did not were Mexi-&#xD;
cans; and they looked dark and frowning.&#xD;
'The truth ,is, my lads,' he continued in the&#xD;
same frank, smiling way in which he had be-&#xD;
gan, 'I have a flag of.my own, which I ship-&#xD;
ped you to sail, under; as nice a piece of&#xD;
buntingas you would liketo see flying above&#xD;
a quarter deck. Louisette, ma belle, hand&#xD;
me that flag you have been working forme!'&#xD;
The smiling Louisette who had no will nor&#xD;
wish that was not identified with his, who 'in&#xD;
her 'heart' she said was her true husband,&#xD;
brought from the cabin and handed to him a&#xD;
roll of bunting. Louis received from his first&#xD;
officer, (one of his old Gibraltar friends) the&#xD;
ensign halyards and skilfully bent on the flag,&#xD;
yet unrolled. He then stood with the halb&#xD;
yards in his hand and continued.&#xD;
'Here my lads is my own flag which in a&#xD;
moment 1 shall display aloft! If you dont&#xD;
like it say so; and he 'who objects to sailing&#xD;
under it is at libertynto go on shore, where&#xD;
these fishermen will give him passage to the&#xD;
Bahize pilot station. ;But those who will sail&#xD;
with me shall have good; cheer, rich prizes,&#xD;
and plenty to do.- Nown stand by my lads to&#xD;
give it three cheers!'  '&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus speaking he ,un up the ball of bunt-&#xD;
ing'to,the mastihad. 'As, it struck the trck&#xD;
it unfQlded and spread broaAly out to the&#xD;
breeze, displaying to the eyes of those on&#xD;
depki a pair of dice,', a' pair of spurs,' and 'a'&#xD;
halter,' worked ona scarlet gogound.,&#xD;
'_There lads is m  lag; mhy father'ibeqhest!&#xD;
The escutcheon hblas transmitted to his son!&#xD;
In a word, born to aflueaep, my father disin-&#xD;
herited me because I lived too fast. He died&#xD;
leaving me in his will this pair of dice, these&#xD;
spurs to ride to the devil with, and this halter&#xD;
to help me on my way !' .As he spoke he&#xD;
displayed the articles to their eyes. .He gave&#xD;
nae these to make my fortune with. I obey&#xD;
him. .. There they fly emblazoned at the mast-&#xD;
head and under them, I mean to acquire that&#xD;
wealth of which he has unjustly robbed me'!&#xD;
Now my lads, you know mne! Will you sail&#xD;
with me? Let the answer je three cheers to&#xD;
m   y lag'&#xD;
The union of boldness, recklessness, and&#xD;
good feeling in his manner, his fine frank face&#xD;
which vice had not yet debased, the ingenu-&#xD;
s recital of his brief history,had upon his&#xD;
audience a wonderful effect,. As if by one&#xD;
impulse every man but two joined in a full&#xD;
swelling uzza; three for the lag,! three again&#xD;
for the captain! three again! for Louisette !'&#xD;
The two had refused to cheer were Ameri-&#xD;
can seamen, who had no idea of compromis-&#xD;
ing themselves in a free cruise. Louis after&#xD;
thanking his men called these two to him, and&#xD;
after questioning theta about their objections,&#xD;
gave them five guineas a piece and setthem&#xD;
ashore at a fisherman's hut, where it was&#xD;
easy to reach the main,.&#xD;
'Tell your .Captain,' said one of the tars as&#xD;
the boft which landed them was putting off,&#xD;
'that if we ev er su  e a free flag, we&#xD;
would choose him for our captain; for he is a&#xD;
true sailor and has his heart in the right place&#xD;
-and he isn't perhaps so much to blame either&#xD;
for hoisting for a flag all his old father left him.&#xD;
Wish himfrom us a long road and merry one&#xD;
before the halter brings him up!'&#xD;
The men promised to do so, ankd faithfully&#xD;
performed it on getting on board. Louis&#xD;
smiled. He, however, did not feel that. hei&#xD;
could fully assent to their moral views. He&#xD;
was as conscious ais any one need be that the&#xD;
nature of his father's bequest proved no ex-&#xD;
cuse for his present position. But he had be-&#xD;
come recklssand indifferent to consequences.&#xD;
Moral feeling had been blunted in his days of&#xD;
profligate eperditure, and feeling that infa-&#xD;
my had followed his name, and that the life&#xD;
of a fellow-being lay at his hand, he felt that&#xD;
his only resource was in a life .of action and&#xD;
daring achievements. He seemed to have a&#xD;
sort of superstitious feeling that he would&#xD;
yet come to the gallows, and be hung with the&#xD;
very halter his father had bequeathed to him!&#xD;
A hundred times, with this idea, he had taken&#xD;
it to destroy it; but some secret feeling of de-&#xD;
fiance of the worst witheld his hand. Having&#xD;
put the men on shore, and go ready to sail,&#xD;
he with this feeling of reckless defiance bound&#xD;
&#xD;
S#&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
the halter about his waist. Within hi, scarlpt&#xD;
sash, and fastsning his spurs nppa,,hisaeels&#xD;
took the dice and said t,Louisette-&#xD;
,Throw with r e, and the result depids&#xD;
which way I steer. Ifyou getthe, highestin&#xD;
three casts I take the Mexican coast down;&#xD;
if I get the liighest I run for Cuba!'&#xD;
The men looked on with interest gathered&#xD;
around the capstanon which, hey threw the&#xD;
dice. Lous got the highest.&#xD;
'Put her away, before the wia4 for the la.-&#xD;
vana!' he cried to the man at the helm.-&#xD;
Thus do I weave ry destiny with my. fath-&#xD;
er' accursedsequests!t.l.&#xD;
Like some snow white bird of triple wing,&#xD;
the light and elegant three masted schooner&#xD;
went flying over the waves in the direction of&#xD;
Cuba, and long before sundown, she was o1st&#xD;
beneath the arching line of the blue horizon.&#xD;

young Captain of theThree Mased Bohooper&#xD;
was designated by the Mexicans, auql El&#xD;
Pirata of the Riigolets, as he was knowaP in&#xD;
Louisiana, from his well-known rendezypes&#xD;
at a Pass so called ern Lake Borgne, we shall&#xD;
but briefly allude to., He swept the gulffrom&#xD;
Vera Cruz,t St Antonio, and his snae be-&#xD;
came as notorious as his power and skill was&#xD;
feared. , He, had been sailing under lis fee&#xD;
flag of the halter but two months,, capturing&#xD;
and plundering many vessels pn, the, waters&#xD;
between tke.Tortugases and Cuba, plundering&#xD;
them, but in no instance taking lfe, when it&#xD;
became necessary to send an araped, vessel in&#xD;
pursuit. With ,consummate prudence aid&#xD;
seamanship united at the same time, withithe&#xD;
utmost boldness and audacity, Louis evaded&#xD;
the brig of war that.had been .sent to capture&#xD;
him. But so persevering was his pursuer that&#xD;
finally he left the waters of, uba, altogether,&#xD;
and run for the Mediterranean., In this,sea&#xD;
he pursued his former free ,profession, unfil&#xD;
the 'Pirate of the spurs,' became the terror&#xD;
of the Mediterranean seamen. After ayars&#xD;
absence, and having successfully evaded q#1&#xD;
attempts to capture him, and learning, that&#xD;
the brig had long before been withdrawn ram&#xD;
her pursuit of him, he set sailagaina for ' e&#xD;
Gulf, with the intention of visiting New Qp.&#xD;
leans to gratify Lonisette to whom he was&#xD;
both aitached and faithful, and who accom-&#xD;
parnied him in all his .cruises,, JIfit assage&#xD;

rendezvous. He therefore decided on mak-&#xD;

it. After remaining a few days in the city&#xD;
he-returned to his schooner to which he had&#xD;
given the name of 'The White Wing,' though&#xD;
she was best known by the expressive title of&#xD;

He boarded and plundered several. vessels,&#xD;

The ship instead of pursuing her voyage put&#xD;
back to the Balise, and the captain proceeding&#xD;

place was the rendezous of a suspicious vessel&#xD;
news had already reached the city. But there&#xD;
was so many hiding places for, smugglers in&#xD;
the waters about New Orleans and so many&#xD;
suspicious vessels frequented them, the rumor&#xD;
created very little attention. But the recent&#xD;
piraciesinthe Gulf'of whih- rumor brought&#xD;
information, and the story- of the 'captain at&#xD;
onde inspired men- with the determination to&#xD;
"'ttempt'he capture ofthe daring rover. The&#xD;
desoriptiorr given of him by the captain of the'&#xD;
plundered vessel, was close -enough to iden-&#xD;
'tify hin with the pirate who had been in the&#xD;
saie waters a year before, and 'El Pirata,'&#xD;
was on every tongue.&#xD;
_The description of the, pirate captain, and&#xD;
thi idea -thers entertained ofhim, by no means&#xD;
answered' that given by us of Louis.'&#xD;
He was described by the captain as a man&#xD;
wihh long, flowing black locks, a ferocious&#xD;
mustache and enormous whiskers and eye-&#xD;
brows, and with spurs 'on his heels; while&#xD;
Louib we have represented as a young man,&#xD;
with soft brown hair, a fresh rqddy counte-&#xD;
natice and without beard or mustache. But&#xD;
Louis had one costume for the deck of hia ves-&#xD;
sel when he prepared to board a prize and an-&#xD;
other face fbr the shore; and t wo persons could&#xD;
flot be inore opposite in appearance than-him-&#xD;
selt in the ;abiret of Benito Soto and the fierce&#xD;
'looking bucamier, whoin he appeared to the&#xD;
eyes of his captives. -t was to tiis-precau-&#xD;
tion that he'6Wed the impunity with which we&#xD;
have se~en him' appear in the streets of New&#xD;
Oirlekus. The party wich went down by the&#xD;
in~$d' Passes to attack his rendezvous found&#xD;
itdserted.- The ruins of the fort bore every&#xD;
&#xD;
trace of having been recently occupied, and&#xD;
the ashes-of fires still remained, with frag-&#xD;
ments of spars, old canvas, rusty bolts, and&#xD;
other refuse of vessels.&#xD;
The White Wing had-flown! She had put in&#xD;
there that morning aud  nchored beneath'the&#xD;
wallsof the fort; but Louis had twenty spies&#xD;
who lived in'the 'city; one of whom Nicole&#xD;
Roque the bojador, whom we 'hzve al-eaaiy&#xD;
seen; hearing of the'intended expedition, took&#xD;
his pirogue and crossing the river'sailed for a&#xD;
bayou which conducted to'the lake 'by an ar-&#xD;
tificial canal. He reached the 'Rigolets in&#xD;
aboit nine'hours, and informed Louis of the&#xD;
contemplated attack. 'In half an hour- after-&#xD;
%vards the White Wing was flying down the&#xD;
Lake, and when the hostile prt  arrived she&#xD;
was discovered by one who climbed to the top&#xD;
of the ruin, looking like a snowy gull nestling&#xD;
under the horizon. But the brig was destined&#xD;
to be more spccessful than the land party. The&#xD;
morning following as the three masted schoon-&#xD;
er was slowly movin   before a faur knot&#xD;
westerly breeze through a low fog bank, and&#xD;
steering south by west, along the Chandeleur&#xD;
Isles, ouis who-was standing near the helm,&#xD;
suddenly beheld the royals and then the -top-&#xD;
gallant-dals of a large brig looming up bright-&#xD;
ly into the sunlight-above the bank of mist.&#xD;
She w as standing N. N. East. His 'vessel&#xD;
from herpeculiar rig, and being with her&#xD;
masts lower in the water had not - yet- been&#xD;
seen from the brig. At a glance he saw by&#xD;
her yards that she was a vessel of war. Quick-&#xD;
er than thought he sprung to the helm and 'put&#xD;
his vessel away. Like an arrow she darted&#xD;
into the bank of dense fog to leeward and the&#xD;
royals of the brig disappeared in the distance.&#xD;
The brig 'the moment after crossed the foam-&#xD;
ing and boiling wake of the schooner, and the&#xD;
captain seeing the agitation knew that a ves.-&#xD;
sel had just 'crossed 'his' track into the fog.&#xD;
He instantly gave orders to put th'e 'helm up&#xD;
and square away the yards;j and the next mo-&#xD;
'ment the brig, which proved' to be a man-of-&#xD;
war sent after the White Wing was following&#xD;
in the wake.&#xD;
Louis confident of having eluded the yes-&#xD;
sel kept steadily on, and thanking the fog&#xD;
'which had befriended~him. In about half an&#xD;
hour he hauled his windanmd drew up along&#xD;
the land. The brig in the meanwhile had not&#xD;
seen the chase, and was only guided by the&#xD;
ripple of her wake. Diut just as Louis altered&#xD;
his course, the wind lifted 'the fog, and to his&#xD;
surprise he saw the brig brewing up her yards&#xD;
not a huridred fathomns astern' and standing&#xD;
for him. In a few minutes the fog' bank&#xD;
broke away, the sun shone upon the -sea, and&#xD;
both vessels wcre, visible to one aryother.-&#xD;
The brig threw a shot over thepirate,. and&#xD;
Louis saw at once that his little clipper was&#xD;
the object of her attention. He ran up his&#xD;
"free flag,' returned the fire fom his 24 pound-&#xD;
er, and then huged his craft' to the wind so&#xD;
as to g  aet h weatther gage ofhis antagonist,&#xD;
and be between him 'and the land. But we&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
The Catalier and the two 'masks!--The trial&#xD;
and judgment-The Chase and Capture.&#xD;
WE shall now once more take our readers&#xD;
into the masquerade,following closely the steps&#xD;
of El Pirata of the Spurs, ifteir Louisette had&#xD;
seen him enter the mortal. Crossing the ves-&#xD;
tibule at the head of the spacious stair-case,&#xD;
he passed into the ante-room for robes' and&#xD;
swords, and there divested himself of his long'&#xD;
black domino and mask, and delivered to the&#xD;
gendarme his arms, consisting of a brace of&#xD;
richly mounted Greek pistols and an -Italian&#xD;
dagger ; for no guest was to wear arms into,&#xD;
the hall under severe penalties. He then pre-&#xD;
sented his silver gilt ticket of admittance to,&#xD;
the Lieutenant of gensdarmes, in attendance&#xD;
at the door of the saloon, and. the next mo-&#xD;
ment found himself in the midst of the noise&#xD;
and splendor and gaiety within, deafened, by,&#xD;
the murmur of a thousand .voices, the crash.&#xD;
of instrumental music, and the tread of the&#xD;
feet of a hundred dancers.&#xD;
lie stood a moment ,near the door survey-&#xD;
ing the scene of life and magnificence wiich&#xD;
the interior of the noble saloon presented to-&#xD;
his view and then, as if reflecting that but&#xD;
one object brought him there, he began to,&#xD;
tread the mazes of the moving througs to seek&#xD;
he who had attracted him. The style of his&#xD;
costume, as that of 'a Georgian Prine was&#xD;
strikingly rich and elegant, and could not'fail&#xD;
to attract admiration ; for there were many&#xD;
parties who seemed to walk about only to a' -&#xD;
mir the varied costumes of the masqueraders.&#xD;
His height, though a little unirsized was&#xD;
commanding, and his person' and catriage&#xD;
gikaceful. His dres was a, tunic of silver&#xD;
cloth,' over which was thrown a short blue silk&#xD;
irntnle;;loose trowsers of embroidered mus-&#xD;
lin, bocts of richly stamped Persian leather,&#xD;
to which his insuperable spur were fastened;&#xD;
and an azure turban studded with stars. A&#xD;
jewelled breast-plate sparkled on'his bosom,&#xD;
and a massive chain of gold encircted his&#xD;
neck.' A crescent of rubies blazed above his&#xD;
broW ! He wore a demi-vipor or half-mask of&#xD;
silver wire, like a knight's visor, which, while&#xD;
it exposed his fine mouth and chin'concealed&#xD;
effectually the upper portion-of his features,&#xD;
and at the same-time gav6 him full cotnmand&#xD;
of his vision. Such was the costuMe aid ap-&#xD;
pearance of Louis as he' walked' round, the&#xD;
Saloon parallel with the dais in search of the&#xD;
object of his admiration. He'looked 'elossly&#xD;
into the alcoves which lined the' wall 'a little&#xD;
raised from the floor to' give those, sated in&#xD;
them a view of the dancers, and he surveyed&#xD;
every female on the promenade. But there&#xD;
was no Circassian slave ! There was no where&#xD;
visible the exquisite figure he carried in his&#xD;
eye. He traversed the circle 'of dacers ex-&#xD;
aming each ohe in vinr. A group 'gathered&#xD;
at the extremity of the hall, ,where seemed 'to&#xD;

'Louis approached the. step where Emme&#xD;

passion,,&#xD;
'Beautiful slave wilt thou be, mine! 1 will&#xD;

deep were, his tones and' so moving-was the&#xD;
cadence'of his rich voice, that a) who heard&#xD;
were assured, that: the Prince, whoever he,&#xD;
might be, was 'not ignorant who the Circas-&#xD;

'Do you know him, dear Emme?' whisper.&#xD;

' No,'' answered , the embarrassed maiden,&#xD;
while -her jewelled bosom heaved with the&#xD;
emotion the words and tones of the stranger'&#xD;
produced in it.      ,&#xD;
' He: knows. you, Emme, and loves you l'&#xD;
said, Georgine.&#xD;
'Our slave it-seems chooses to remain-with&#xD;
us, royal brother,' said Florence who wished.&#xD;
to put an end to a scene evidently approach-&#xD;
m  too near the real drama of teeIing for, him&#xD;
to suffer his sister to be longer an actor in.-&#xD;
Thou wilt have to put up with our first gift,&#xD;
of'half of our kingdom  ,o which'we add our&#xD;
thronealso? We, therefore, do now resign it&#xD;
to you!'&#xD;
Thus speaking Florence taking Georgine by&#xD;
the, hand conducted her from the throne close-,&#xD;
ly followed by'Emme and the three- mingled&#xD;
with the crowd which they had thus far con&#xD;
tributed 'their part to entertain. Louis, in-&#xD;
stead of ascending the throne stood and gazed&#xD;
after the retiring.figure of the -beautiful Cir-.&#xD;
cassian,-and then took the same way followed&#xD;
by criesof,&#xD;
'Success, Monseigneur Prince!'&#xD;
" Thouhast fairly won the beauteous Cir-&#xD;
cassian. Pursue and woo her fairly and she&#xD;
will surrenderI'I&#xD;
'Bravo, hoble Prince! Tell her thou wilt&#xD;
settle it with a cast of thy charmed dice!'&#xD;
Not heeding .these remarks of encourage-&#xD;
ment, Louis pursued them, now some dis-&#xD;
tance off, guided by the crescent glittering&#xD;
above the tall figure of Florence. But hilt&#xD;
way was impeded by groups-tanding around&#xD;
or by -parties .of promenaders 'crossing his&#xD;
path and he was- soon, unable 'to distinguish&#xD;
the .crescent which' guided him, among the&#xD;
multitude of snowy plumes, flashing tiaras,&#xD;
blazing casques, and je welled coronets. He,&#xD;
ho wever, pressed on and after some- difficulty&#xD;
again caught' sight of the crescent. ..The&#xD;
wearer was whirling in the waltz folding in&#xD;

his manly arm the princeSs. Where was tbe.&#xD;

without delaying to look with-a hundred'others&#xD;
upon the grace and stately bearing with which,&#xD;
they moved in the' waltz, he began his search&#xD;
for the Circassian, among ,those who stood&#xD;
around. His efforts were unsuccessful, though&#xD;
very persevering; and he had- just Made up&#xD;
his mind to stand quietly- until the two had,&#xD;
done waltzing at' which- time they, would&#xD;
rejoin her wherever she was and thus give'&#xD;
him an opportunity of-'again finding and&#xD;
being. near her, when his eyes fell upon&#xD;
her standing not two'yards'from hini. 'With&#xD;
a half suppressed expression' of pleasure by a&#xD;
sudden forward  movement he placed himself&#xD;
by her side. She had evidently observed himi&#xD;
for she slightly laughed as he approahed and&#xD;
drew herself- backrapi'dly .retreating among&#xD;
the bystanders.&#xD;
Louis pursued, and after ,a lively chase'&#xD;
came up with her at a place where a barrier&#xD;
separated the ,dais from the dancing fior.&#xD;
Unable to retreat farther, she stopped and&#xD;
folded her hands submissively upon -her bo-,&#xD;

The False Mask-Louiasand the Green'.Cavalier;&#xD;
-The Xote.-Don Rafael Valdes.--'The,&#xD;
Report.,,&#xD;
On approachng'the door of the salon where&#xD;
the 1confdsion prevailed, Louis ,saw the cava-&#xD;
lier 'who.lhadbeen claimed by thetwo female&#xD;
masks, standing with one' of 'them clinging, to&#xD;

'A after the decision'which hadibeen-given by&#xD;
Louis as the Georgian 'Prince, arid she had'&#xD;
retreated.from the throne, she had again en-&#xD;
deavored in the throng -to- substitute herself'&#xD;
for her rival 'upon! the cavalier's attentions;&#xD;
and was so successfulas to separate' them aid&#xD;
place her a:rm in his. 'The other, h6wever,ap.&#xD;

called on the' cavalier to cast her'off.' Believw;&#xD;

grasp his sword hilt, And uttered a deep curse&#xD;
at finding himself without a weapon.&#xD;
'I Did I know whether thou wert white or&#xD;

criedfiercely; yet not making any step to-&#xD;
wards Louis who stood, Calmly by with the&#xD;
trembling Circassian on his arm.&#xD;
W.Now thou knowest !' answered Louis,quiet-&#xD;
ly unmasking and removing' his turbanf ex-&#xD;
hibiting a fair complexion, a clear fearless blue:&#xD;
eye, and- softflowing brown locks. -Thre&#xD;
was a buzz of applause at his manly beauty&#xD;
as well as at his-youth. . 4 And thou knowea..&#xD;
me now also,' he softly added bending hisheaa&#xD;
and speaking low to the fair mask on his arn&#xD;
'Monsieur shall hear from me,' said tht,&#xD;
green cavalier, Lif he will give me his card!&#xD;
' It is at Monsieur's service' said Louis;&#xD;
and taking a tablet from-his sashhe wrote on&#xD;
a'blank card and-handed it to him. Then re-&#xD;
placing his mask he turned lightly away and&#xD;
mingled with ' a group -wbo were moving to-&#xD;
wards the refreshment room. The Circassian'&#xD;
still -hung on, his arm. He. soon found a re-&#xD;
tired spot- half-enrtaine-d and in shadow, to&#xD;
rhich, after conducting her there, he ordered&#xD;
a-servant to bring ices., - There we will leave&#xD;
thein.for a while to a tete-a tee over their crys-&#xD;
taltbups of crene de glace.&#xD;
'The cavalier in green,glancing-at the card,,&#xD;
read, aloud with some difficulty, for Louis&#xD;
wrote hurriedly on his knee-,&#xD;
"X. LOUIS,&#xD;
Cabaret de Benito &amp;amp;oto,&#xD;
Run RorL.E"&#xD;
"A lodger in a cabaret!' he repeated to him-&#xD;
self.- 'But were he even a vile keeper of a&#xD;
cabaret I would have my revenge for this in-&#xD;
sult, if he can abut - know how to handle'a&#xD;
sword,' he said, speaking aloud and looking&#xD;
round.&#xD;
A If he *ere a brave man,' said a French-&#xD;
mnant standing by as the Cavalier moved away,&#xD;
' he would net have let this M. Louis here have&#xD;
gone without avenging himself on the spot.&#xD;
The young man did eight . in unmasking him&#xD;
for unmasking a woman!'&#xD;
The French man ,doubtless had the same&#xD;
kind of sympathy that led- Louis to avenge&#xD;
the quadruone.; ,a partiality'for one of' the&#xD;
lass! .It was this feeling that led-Louis to&#xD;
atelp forward ashedid; and besides-he had re-&#xD;
cognized the quadroone to be aft acquaintanceI&#xD;
of Louisette's.; whom it will be -een, he was!&#xD;
atthe same mdment both Atrue an4 .false to&#xD;
Truein feeling but-false in practice.'&#xD;
., The person he had unmasked was a young&#xD;
man of fortune by, the name of Tievett Brint-&#xD;
nal, a Virginian Iby birth 'but a resident of&#xD;
Lexington in Kentueky , in the vicinity: of&#xD;
which place he had- inherited. large landed&#xD;
estate.  His. money affairs had become in-&#xD;
volved by a high style. of living, an d his raf-&#xD;
fairisere" in la very. derangedu~condition ;--&#xD;
iwhiletu h i o 'respect changed his mode of&#xD;
life or lessened is expenditure. -He was not,&#xD;
&#xD;
however, insensible to what must be the ulti-&#xD;
mate' result;and, indisposed. to retrench and&#xD;
econiomise he. determined to rescue himself&#xD;
by a wealthy alliance; in -addition to Geor-&#xD;
giana -Warfield's wealth, her beauty attracted&#xD;
him and' inspired him with .a sensation as&#xD;
nearly akin to love as could exist in the breast&#xD;
of a young man who loved only himself. Miss&#xD;
Warfield, however, gave him no encourage-&#xD;
ment. ,.He, however, followed her from Lex-&#xD;
ington to New Orleans at the beginning of the&#xD;
season, and fearing to lose her among the ad-&#xD;
mirers with which she was surrounded, he,lin&#xD;
a few days after her arrival, 'declared his-pas-&#xD;
sion and made her the offer of his hand. She&#xD;
civilly but firmly declined.the proffered honor.&#xD;
He had sense enough to see .that there was no&#xD;
hope for him; and began to turn his eyes in&#xD;
another direction. He had already heard of-&#xD;
the beautiful and rich Emme- Noel; and to-&#xD;
wards her he now resolvedto direct his views.&#xD;
He easily succeeded in getting an introduc-&#xD;
tion to Florence, and through him to his sis-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Trevett Brintnall was -a man of.education&#xD;
and address. He had the tact to render his&#xD;
society pleasing; and -when he, made the ef-&#xD;
fort to please, he generally succeeded in ef.&#xD;
fecting his object among those, who,.having&#xD;
no knowledge-of his former life, and of his&#xD;
tottering fortunes,, were free from the preju-&#xD;
dices which were in the outset a barrier to his&#xD;
success with Miss Warfield. With such a&#xD;
peize as Emme's beauty and money he had no&#xD;
ordinary inceiitive to exert himself. He in&#xD;
gratiated himself with Florence, from whom&#xD;
he kept his true character and pecuniary con-,&#xD;
dition concealed, vind soon became a daily vis-&#xD;
iterat his house. Emme, young, susceptible&#xD;
and warm-hearted, and placing the fullest-&#xD;
confidence in one presented to "her by her&#xD;
brother,suffered her heart to yield to the fas-&#xD;
cinations of his address,.the devotion of his-&#xD;
attentions, the apparent sincerity of his ad-&#xD;
miration' At-length he formally addressed&#xD;
.her and was referred by her, to Florence.-&#xD;
'This wasson the very day upon the evening&#xD;
of which we now meet him in the salon St.&#xD;
Louis!, He had not since met;Florence, and&#xD;
had deferred 'making the application to him&#xD;
till the'next day.&#xD;
'In the meanwhile we find him mingling in&#xD;
all the gaiety of the masquerade, whither he&#xD;
had come in company with, a rich and beauti,&#xD;
ful Alabamian, who,' rith her mother, were at&#xD;
the Hotel St. Charles; to whom he had been&#xD;
also paying his~addresses as a reserve in case&#xD;
the more wealthy Emme Noel should refuse&#xD;
him! t'.The unmasked.quadroone, once a favo.&#xD;
rite distresss, with jealous 'watchfulness quite&#xD;
equal to that of Louisette, had found out and&#xD;
copied the-costume of her whom she regarded&#xD;
as her only rival, (for she had never yet seen&#xD;
him abroad with Emme) an d hence occurre d&#xD;
the scenes which have been narrated.&#xD;
*But what had he to do there with the Ala-&#xD;
bamian on the very evening of the day he had&#xD;
been accepted by Emme!l' will ask some one&#xD;
&#xD;
of my fair readers, who is no doubt shocked at a&#xD;
the duplicity of this lover. The invitation by M&#xD;
him to the Alabamian had been given someIl&#xD;
days before; 'and, he was the more ready to c&#xD;
fulfil his engagement with- her, inasmuch'as: c&#xD;
he did not expect to meet Emme there till d&#xD;
after eight o'clock, while he went there from  tI&#xD;
the St. Charles with the other'lady a little" c'&#xD;
after seven. -,Emme had in the afternoon h&#xD;
playfully but positively refused to let him  c&#xD;
know what her costume was to be, but told l&#xD;
him that he must,with the instinct oflove, dis- tl&#xD;
cover her. He, therefore, was willing to re- ti&#xD;
venge himself a'little by letting her see him  s&#xD;
with the lovely Alabamian. He had not pen- a&#xD;
etrated her disguise of a Circassian when she s&#xD;
sat upon the steps of the throne; nor indeed h&#xD;
had she detected in the 'green 'cavalier her a&#xD;
deceitful lover; for the hollow mask wholly d&#xD;
changed his voice as it issued forth.  '  f&#xD;
He had been afterwards seeking her in every t&#xD;
female form like hers that passed him, when'&#xD;
the false mask reappeared and the. scene fol- '1&#xD;
lowed we, have just described. Such was the- t&#xD;
character of the green cavalier-of Trevett&#xD;
Brintnal!                          eII&#xD;
After he had contemptuously put up the&#xD;
card which Louis had given him, he was too&#xD;
irritated to remain, and left the Saloon with I&#xD;
the Alabhamian on his armcalled for a carriage'&#xD;
and without replying to any questions put by-&#xD;
her escorted her to her 'hotel. He then' re-'&#xD;
turned to the Salon 'St. Louis, threwa  domino'&#xD;
over his green- apparel,-got a different mask I&#xD;
and once more entered the masquerade roOm,&#xD;
thoroughly disguised.,, All was going on 'via t&#xD;
he had left it half an 'hour before. Every- ,&#xD;
where he sought for the person who had in-&#xD;
sulted him, and also- for' Emme; but Louis&#xD;
was too happy in the covert of the alcove in&#xD;
making warm Jove to the fair Citcassian over I&#xD;
ices, to have yet rejoined the crowd.   I&#xD;
'At len th by accident he recognised Flor-&#xD;

they said could be 'overheard; such',as Don&#xD;

I Will Mondieur oblige us with the informa-&#xD;
tion ? asked a Creole gentleman with impa,.&#xD;
tience.&#xD;
, , It has been discovered.that,.M., Florence'&#xD;
and his sister are of ; quadroonre blood. That&#xD;
they are the.children of a quadroone,' Lucrece,&#xD;
whowas nurse in M. Noel's family. 'Madanve&#xD;
Noel never: had any children; and M. Noel&#xD;
has educated and passed these, off on the pub-&#xD;
lic as his own. You see they-are both bru-,&#xD;
piettes-'        .&#xD;
'When was this extraordinary discovery&#xD;
made ?' asked several persons after the first&#xD;
burst of astonishment and surprise had a lit-&#xD;
tle subsided ; for the announcement produced&#xD;
an astounding effect upon his hearers.&#xD;
'To-day.'&#xD;
'It is false!'. cried a young man present..&#xD;
'It will be proven in Court tomorrow,' an-&#xD;
swered Valdes.&#xD;
The true mother is living and claims her&#xD;
children; and there is, besides a priest who&#xD;
will take oath that Madame Noel confessed to&#xD;
him that they were not her own children.'&#xD;
'Who are you that say this ?' demanded the&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
I am Don Rafael Valdes.'&#xD;
To attempt to describe the effect this.intel-&#xD;
ligence produced upon the group.would be&#xD;
vain. Under cover of the excitement he had,&#xD;
raised, Valdes retired and waited theresult qf&#xD;
his night's work, which he- knew would be,&#xD;
made manifest when the masks should be re-&#xD;
nmoved and the bal masque, according to: pre-&#xD;
vious.regulations, should , be changed for the&#xD;
rest of the evening, or rather of the night,&#xD;
into a fancy costume ball. .,&#xD;

his way as if purposely to deepen the insult&#xD;
they had put upon him.&#xD;

What is all this? I hear men saying here&#xD;
and there of thee, 'he should be put outthe&#xD;

name What have you done?'&#xD;
'That is more than I can answer the,&#xD;
Monsieur,' said Florence with  - quick eino-&#xD;
tion of'gratitude at finding oneiwfriendly tone&#xD;
and look, at once recognising the fade of the&#xD;
young seaman, who had' presented himself for&#xD;
Louisette after he had rescued her.&#xD;

service once to night, and I will staid by&#xD;
thee. -For her sake who hangs, terrified-upon&#xD;

' Monsieur, I am grateful. My sister' has&#xD;
alone prevented me from making -my own&#xD;

the support of both his arms.&#xD;

were corifrontiag'torence, having planted&#xD;
themselves' ddiec'i6j-n the passage,;which&#xD;
ran between a 2droiof 'colums; theft having&#xD;
taken their post between two. Many others&#xD;
stood round looking on with interest. Flor-&#xD;
ence, Emme, Louis, were alone, as it seemed&#xD;
against the-whole salon.&#xD;
'Messieurs,: I pass here ' said Louis in a&#xD;
calm clear tone. " He who disputes niy pas&#xD;
sage risks his life!'&#xD;
Don Rafael, who stood nighest, met his eye&#xD;
and then stepped aside muttering an oath.-&#xD;
Jules 'Moreau- stood'- firm as -if resolved t&#xD;
'maintain his post. His arm was locked ii&#xD;
that'of Colonel Andre's.&#xD;
'I must, pass, Monsieur,''said Louis in th&#xD;
same quiet tone.&#xD;
'Does Monsieur intend to move?'  '&#xD;
'No.'&#xD;
As quick as thought the the hand of Loui&#xD;
was upon the collar of the young French&#xD;
man and lifting him up with as much ease a&#xD;
if he had been a child, he thrbw him acros&#xD;
the barrier ' into the alcove; A murmur o&#xD;
astonishment and surprise followed this act o&#xD;
surprising strength! - Colonel Andreaimed&#xD;
blow at Louis's breast which he caughtfupo&#xD;

The imbecile .The'. dieppointment--The&#xD;
.                n.&#xD;
I- an apartment t the extremity of the&#xD;
corridor on the second floor of the house into&#xD;
which Florence entered, sat a gentleman in&#xD;
a robe, e chambre. His head was perfectly&#xD;
white.;,though his age was, not fifty. - His&#xD;
countennce was a -noble wreck of former&#xD;
-strength, and-intellect. The roop was sunp-&#xD;
tuously furnished, and a shaded, lamp shed a&#xD;
- soft light upon the crimson and musli- dra-&#xD;
.pery of the windpws and couch. It was long&#xD;
- past miidight, yet he sat in a deep velvet&#xD;
hahked chair, hi bed untouched. On the&#xD;
floor at his feet, crouched a young slave half&#xD;
a sleep: and on a pallet inone-corner slept a&#xD;
negro woman,-his attendants. -. He was gaz-&#xD;
ing with a. vacant eye on the row of gilt rings&#xD;
by which the bed curtains, were suspended&#xD;
f from a rod, andcounting them incessantly in&#xD;
anumbling tone of voice., Now- he would&#xD;
count them forward, now backward,and give&#xD;
utterancetoa low idiotic chuckle, as at each&#xD;
end ofthe rod the number ofthe rings cameout&#xD;
the same. t seemed as it -were, to his mind&#xD;
a great.mystery that it should be so.  .&#xD;
This person was the father of Florence and&#xD;
Emme.. The light of his- -ind had dimmed,&#xD;
- and reason no more held the reins of, his&#xD;
being. His existence was animal only, .a&#xD;
living body, without a souL&#xD;
- e  deny. a rapid step,,a-heavy deterrnin-&#xD;
ed tread, along the corridor capght,- hs -ear.&#xD;
He started, stopped his counting and. listen-&#xD;
ed like a timid hare. The n qgmoment the&#xD;
door of his' ropm was thrown violently !open&#xD;
and Florence entered bearing the lifeless&#xD;
form of Emme supported on one arm, the&#xD;
other still holding his sword. He stopped-&#xD;
gazeda romeit ora-the affrighted - old man,&#xD;
who hid his face in his rob as he. entered,&#xD;
and then approaching the bed .he placed his&#xD;
sister -pon-t&#xD;
'Lay theie, unhappy child!'It were bet-&#xD;
ter, if this fearful tale be true, that you never&#xD;
come -again-to' -consciousness. He looked&#xD;
tendeily upon her lovely 'ianimMate face, and&#xD;
then turned away and approached his father.&#xD;
- He did not atfirst speak to- him. 'He. stood&#xD;
and gazed-upon' him with a -face expressive&#xD;
of -bitter despair-ofhopeless despondency.&#xD;
'Who-is it?' asked the old-man 'without&#xD;
Suncoverig his features.&#xD;
"Florence Fither,' he added taking his&#xD;
hand inhis and kneeling by his side, '-will&#xD;
you try and listen to me !'- -&#xD;
'There are twenty-eight ring - counting&#xD;
,one way and twenty eight counting the other&#xD;
&#xD;

dear father! Rally your mind, - and answer&#xD;
me one question!&#xD;
'You) have not answeed me,  and you&#xD;
frightened me when you came in! I thought&#xD;
it was robbers!&#xD;
'Father, do you remember myniother?'&#xD;
'Mother-.mother! I have no mother,' he&#xD;
muttered as if impatient at being thus pressed.&#xD;
'Your wife, the mother of Emme. Do'you&#xD;
not reniembrher.'   -&#xD;
 ' Oh, I remember I  ad a wife! Oh  es.&#xD;
She was poisoned! Iremnember. But I don't&#xD;
kenember Emme!&#xD;
'Emme was her child.  I was her 'child,&#xD;
father!'&#xD;
'1 don't remember,' answered the imbecile&#xD;
old man with a slow negative movement ci&#xD;
his head fioin side to side.&#xD;
'Po yot; not know me, iny father?. Do&#xD;
you not-remember that I am your son Flo-&#xD;
reuc&#xD;
'Yes, I know you are Florence?7 You have&#xD;
!egood son to he, Florence' he said&#xD;
lyng his hand upon his arI.&#xD;
a  would have loved iy miither also, if she&#xD;
had lived.'&#xD;
'V'our idther-slie p6isoried her!' ---&#xD;
'Who, of'whom do you speak?'&#xD;
'T wenity-eight this way aned twenty-eigh&#xD;

old man again directed his attentionn to th&#xD;
rings and resumed his nmonotonous ceaselis&#xD;
counting.&#xD;
Florence rose in despair, for he had beez&#xD;
.kneeling before himand paced to andl fr&#xD;
the chamber, - He tried to'ilebt calmly ahn&#xD;
cooly upon what had occurred. At one mo&#xD;
-went he would laugh with derision' that s~&#xD;
wild a tale should for a moment be regarde&#xD;
eeriously; and the next, as he thought ove&#xD;
the insulting scenes at the masquerade, h~&#xD;
clenched is fists and vehemently "beat hi&#xD;

' Nothing. You have been ill. Take this'&#xD;

edit at his hands, and soon after fell into a&#xD;
quiet slumber.&#xD;
'There sleep, my child! May angels watch&#xD;
over thee! Sleep and be strong to bear,&#xD;
whAn you awake whatever evil' may be the&#xD;
issue of this! I-A'ust. now go forth and. see&#xD;
whence this rumor hath come. I will trace&#xD;
it up to its source! I will find its starting&#xD;
place, and there prove it to the world a foul&#xD;
lie! 'In the. courts he said-this Valdes,&#xD;
in whose Jeyes I saw sparkle malicious tri-&#xD;

claims of grattitude. I will seek the prison&#xD;
andsee that this young man who defended&#xD;
me so boldly be released on my security.&#xD;
But off with this masquerading attire! I bet-&#xD;
ter- become a- slave's tunic than a prince's&#xD;
robe!' he added with bitterness.   .&#xD;
He retired to his room and in a short time&#xD;
aftierwards came forth in a plain citizen's&#xD;
dress, enveloped in a roquelaire, ajd his hat&#xD;
shading his features. . On gaining the street&#xD;
he took his way in-the direction of the prison.&#xD;
The sun was butjustrising and he fdlt re-&#xD;
lievedat the reflection that he'should not be&#xD;
likely-to encounter any one he knew. As&#xD;
he passed, the botel St. Louis, his blood&#xD;
rushed like lightning from his heart to ,his&#xD;
brain, and he felt as if he should fall to the&#xD;
ground 't was there that Georgine' abode,&#xD;
an! he could see the closely drawn crimson&#xD;
c-tains of the window of her apartment. It.&#xD;
was the first time his own and his sister's&#xD;
misery gav egm~ full time to turn his thoughts&#xD;
towds her. He groaned deeply.s lIe could&#xD;
nowv nceout for the abrupt manner in which&#xD;
CohuliV9arfield had' ta n her from' his&#xD;
arm. Opuld sheet too, believe this' strange&#xD;
and' reproable tae. And why unprobalble?&#xD;
he asked himself. Have not such tings be-&#xD;
&#xD;
fore happened? 'Tis not three months since&#xD;
a young imerhant shot himself, on discover-&#xD;
'ing hiniself'to be a quadroone! If this prove&#xD;
true, Emme and I had better both die! Im-&#xD;
probable it will not be regarded in a city&#xD;
where such' things have before occurred;&#xD;
and, for that reason, this tale is more easily be-&#xD;
lieved! But can she believe it ? That note*'&#xD;
I now believe had reference to this tale;:per-&#xD;
haps informed her of the rumor. She Mtore it&#xD;
up with indignation! If the paper referred to&#xD;
it, she believed not the report. . This idea,&#xD;
sustains me! Yet I may not approach her to&#xD;
confirm it! I will not see her 'until I have&#xD;
proved it false!'&#xD;
With a spirit that rose in resolution and&#xD;
strength, with the idea of Georgine's favor,&#xD;
he moved onward towards the prison. Re&#xD;
soon reached its glootny precincts, and caie&#xD;
to the main entrance. The turnkey at first&#xD;
refused to admit him; but a piece of gold re-&#xD;
moved his objections. The heavy. iron gate&#xD;
ofthe lobby was unchained, and. unlocked&#xD;
and opened by him, and an assistant was sent&#xD;
with him through the passages of the prison&#xD;
to conduct him to Louis. .'After opening&#xD;
another gate, composed ofa strong "lattice of&#xD;
iron barascovered, with sheet iron, Florence&#xD;
found himself in a vast apartment of the pris-&#xD;
on, gloomy and revolting in its features. It-&#xD;
was the common prison-room of the Cala-&#xD;
boose, and capable of accomodating a hun-&#xD;
dred prisoners, half of which number, ofevery&#xD;
shade of complexion, and seemingly of every&#xD;
nation, were now there locked up, as he en-&#xD;
tered. Some were piled in a dark corner still&#xD;
asleep: others were eating their coarse break--&#xD;
fasts; others pacing up and down gloomily.&#xD;
Some ofthin seemed reckless, some sad;&#xD;
some were silent, and others noisy. All were&#xD;
more or less wild and savage looking; and&#xD;
not a few had stamped upon' their ferocious&#xD;
visage, the deep impression ofvillany. Many&#xD;
voices were confusedly mingled together in&#xD;
half a dozen tongues and there prevailed a&#xD;
disorderly confusion anda savageindepend-&#xD;
ence of all control. Near the door on the&#xD;
inside a gezdaee with a musket at his shoul-&#xD;
der walked up and down. To him Florence&#xD;
made known his business.&#xD;
'If you want to see the young man in&#xD;
masquerade costume who was brought in at&#xD;
two o'clock this morning, you will find him,&#xD;
there asleep!'&#xD;
Florence crossed the stone floor to the op-&#xD;
posite side of the prison and saw the person&#xD;
he came to se gnietly sleeping wrapped in&#xD;
the domino M1Idg'orn to the salon over his&#xD;
rich, costume'. ;Hegazed a moment on his&#xD;

VOS1CLU5MOM,&#xD;
Taz morning following these events, the i&#xD;
city was thrown int 'theW eatestexcitemeit&#xD;
by the rumor that the piratieal schone- I&#xD;
'The White Wing,' whjph'had been captur- w&#xD;
ed a few days before anxd'lay alongside of the T&#xD;
brig of war in the stream, had disappeared in ra&#xD;
the night, no one knew whither! She was ai&#xD;
not missed until day light, when the intelli- n&#xD;
gence flew like wild-fire through the town.- w&#xD;
To lhis was soon added another report equal- ol&#xD;
ly startling; that Florence Noel had escaped lc&#xD;
from prison ! Soon after came the intelligence P&#xD;
that Benito Soto had disappeared leaving his a&#xD;
cabard wide open all night !-then followed b,&#xD;
the rumor that the quadroon Lucrece had left ei&#xD;
her home the evening before with a stranger m&#xD;
on business and had not been since heard w&#xD;
from. Finally, to crown all, it was discover- i&#xD;
ed by some suspicious persons who went to c&#xD;
see, that the padre Fausto had disappeared&#xD;
from his cell in the old convent !&#xD;
The brig of war got underweigh in -pur-&#xD;
suit of the schooner; and the town was rife&#xD;
with a hundred various rumors and surmises.&#xD;
To Florence was given the credit of running I&#xD;
away with the schooner, after first murdering&#xD;
the quadroon and the padre!&#xD;
If we had room, we should be glad to fol- I&#xD;
low in detail all these events. But as we must(&#xD;
draw our chapter and story to a close, we canI&#xD;
only say brieny, that Louis, the "Pirate of:I&#xD;
The Spurs,' was the prime mover in all-these:&#xD;
several'disappearances! That having assem-I&#xD;
bled and instructed his men in the evening,I&#xD;
he had succeeded in severally getting into his.&#xD;
power Benito, the Padre, and the Quadroon&#xD;
Lucrece, who, each one alone were decoyedI&#xD;
by stratagem to the little vessel of Roque the&#xD;
bojador and safely confined under the forward&#xD;
deck. .That then Louis by heavy bribes got&#xD;
admission to Florence's cell and prevailed&#xD;
upon him to consent to escape, overruling his&#xD;
objections, and showing him how, thereby,&#xD;
he could prove to the world his legitimacy.-&#xD;
He then by a large bribe prevailed on he'&#xD;
gendarme who was guard over him, and who&#xD;
proved to be our old acquaintance Jerome Ja'&#xD;
cot, tojescape with him. The three-left the&#xD;
prison without any obstacle, Jerome having&#xD;
furnished Florence with a complete suit of&#xD;
the gensdarmee' uniform. Before goingto the&#xD;
little vessel of the bojador, Florence stepped&#xD;
to see Emme. He would have pursuaded her&#xD;
to escape with him ; but she plead the filial&#xD;
'duty owed to their father. Florence admitted&#xD;
the justice of this .duty ; and assuring her&#xD;
that the whole story (as Louis had explained&#xD;
to him) was a plot of Don Rafael's the priest&#xD;
