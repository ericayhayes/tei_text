T rhere Wa'S a cloud on Edward ClerVil e's brow,&#xD;
a graVity on his :lip, that contrasted strongly with&#xD;
the smiles- of pleased approbation which the faces&#xD;
of his bi-other and two sisters wore. .Their father&#xD;
hatd just announced to them his approaching mar-&#xD;
riage, and now looked around with some anxiety&#xD;
to mark the effect of the communication. The&#xD;
congratulations and good wishes 4of his daughteis&#xD;
and their eldest Jbrother were uttered warmly and'&#xD;
affectionately. Edward spoke,'too, with becom-&#xD;
ing respect ; but there was no, cordiality in his.&#xD;
studied sentences. Mr. Clerville rose and stood&#xD;
on the hearth so as to 'face the .little circle.&#xD;
He was still a handsome man, notwithstanding&#xD;
the slight baldness upon his -forehead and a lit&#xD;
tle spring ling of silver in the dark hair, which~&#xD;
b;etokene4 that life, with him, had passed its me&amp;amp;&#xD;

Lucy Clerville was a pale, spiritual-looking&#xD;

out involuntarily recurring to those exquisite&#xD;
SONNITS TO QENEYRA, which ate, pei~iaps, equal&#xD;
ifl beauty and superior in pathos to any of By-&#xD;

figure was fairy-like in lightness and proportion.&#xD;

fu I, but of too et1~ereal beauty to. excite general&#xD;
ad'mir~tion. The' ordinary beholder would pause.&#xD;
a. moment and gaze, as at "some ~marble saint&#xD;

H&amp;amp; younger sister, Kate, was as unlike Lucy&#xD;

notwithstanding the smile on herjips. One hand&#xD;

genial and kindly his air, that misanthropy itseh&#xD;
must have turned abashed from a physiognomy&#xD;
which so obviously confused jts dark theory ot&#xD;
mafi' s nature. Like Kate's, his face was morc&#xD;
serious thaii at mosf times. Ther&amp;amp; was even, an&#xD;
expression of anxiety upon it, as lie glanced from&#xD;
his father's face to that of his bi~tlier, who loaned&#xD;
beside thb chimney, his elb~v resting' on the&#xD;

1eav~s of a 'book which lay thereon. Â£dward~s&#xD;

eVery ~spect a ~uitahle mother for his daugh-&#xD;

early day for the niarriage, hoping that, when&#xD;
the matter was irrevocably con6luded, he should&#xD;
n'6 longer be tormented by the poigflal4regret&#xD;

yielded to what at such ti~nes~ he half considered&#xD;
an imaginary sense of duty4. after alL 'And never&#xD;

deeply. a~ 'at 'this moment, when the expression&#xD;
of Edward's' eyes7-those eyes so like his&#xD;
thor' s-p-seemed to him full of reproach for this&#xD;
infidelity to her memory.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Edward was little less troubled&#xD;
than his father. Greatly agitated, Qne moment&#xD;
he felt that he had been unkind, undutifnl the&#xD;
next, he was indignant, almost aiigry, shocked,&#xD;
incredulous, at the idea that another was about&#xD;
ic take th~ place of his mother. Perhaps,&#xD;
though unconsciously,, jealousy for himself miu~&#xD;
gled with his jealousy for her. lie had been so&#xD;
accustomed to associate his father'-s love 'fox his&#xD;
mother's memory with his affection for himself'&#xD;
that' he coidd not well bear to ~nd the one&#xD;
fading, le~st the other should vanish too.&#xD;

Edward iiPoluntarily glanced 'at Blanche as Frank&#xD;

not blushed at all before, but she colo~ed., ci'imson&#xD;

they were blushing so.&#xD;
It was worse than ever with them after this,' and&#xD;
it is not to be suPposed that such singular coliduct'&#xD;
passed unnoticed by the rest of4h~ family. Every&#xD;
one,. however, though~ fit to let' it pass~ silently. 'Mr.&#xD;
Clerville expressed much mortification abo~it it pri-&#xD;
vately to his wife, but she begged him not to -speak&#xD;
'to Edward on the subject; a~ he~~oposed doing.&#xD;
A' Depend uppn it, my deax, it- is only diffidence,"&#xD;
she said. "They wifl get over it in 4mb, 'and, be'&#xD;

"Of course; but she never mentioned~ the subject&#xD;

'~' But what can be the reason of it? I' am sure I&#xD;

Dare.~devil's visit'of a' fortnight wa~ over, and 'Fi'ank&#xD;
had accompanied' him as far as Scarsborough, on his~&#xD;

noon to meet Frank as he was returning. Their path&#xD;
i~ay throughh a pretty Wood, That was inteTrsected mi&amp;amp;.&#xD;
way by ~a river, which held within its chrystid - arms a&#xD;
beautiful, picturesque ~iittle-" island. Frank and E4...&#xD;

gate 'this - stream in a small ~b$at of very primitive'&#xD;
Construction, the chief t~eoo iidi~tion of which: wa.~&#xD;

~1wtiyer, ~ . The ;b~nk; i~nd&#xD;
&#xD;
was fastened by' a long, stout chain, to a stake driven&#xD;
firmly into the ground..&#xD;
"Suppose we get in the boat, and go across to the&#xD;
island?" said Kate. "Frank has oftenitaken me over,&#xD;
toÂ§get muskadines and grapes. There ar~so many&#xD;
~ vines thei e. Is it not a beautiful place?"&#xD;
"Beautiful!" answered Blanche. "I- should. like&#xD;
very much to g~o, though it is now too ~late foi~ ifiusca-&#xD;
diiies and gi~apes. But I am afraid we vould uot&#xD;
inan~tge the canoe. Tust think of our sailing off&#xD;
down stream. We"&#xD;
"Oh!" interrupted Kate, "' I am sure we can man-&#xD;
age it. It is as light-"as pos~ible. 'See~ we can. try&#xD;
~ 'first without unchaining it.' You take that pole.&#xD;
There-I told you so," she exclaimed in triumph, as,&#xD;
by their united efforts they propelled the little dug-&#xD;
K Qiltup stream as. far as thq chain '~oijld admit of its&#xD;
~ going. "Now we will push uj close 'to the'bank and&#xD;
unloose it," coritiwued Kat~e, binding with all her&#xD;

"I am almost graid," said Blanche, 'doubtfully.&#xD;
~ "Do. you really think thnt if we unchain it, it will not&#xD;
run away with us?"&#xD;
." Why, I am sure it can't. Why.should not we row&#xD;
a boat ~s well as Ellen Douglas did? And Loch&#xD;

after tugging until their deli'~ate hands h*~d exchanged&#xD;
The hue of the lily for thatof the rose, they succeeded&#xD;
in drawing the heavy iron ring fro~n over the stake.&#xD;
Dropping the clattering length of chain into the bot~~&#xD;

Having wound the chain several- times about the&#xD;
trunk of a slender tree- on the' margi~i of the 'water,&#xD;
they passed the stick through the iron ring and one&#xD;
link of the ~ thus holding the two together quite&#xD;
securely.~&#xD;
"H.xv' clever ~ve ar~!" they both exclaimed-and&#xD;
by this time quite wearied out~ sat themselves on a&#xD;
soft cushion of moss to rest.&#xD;

finds us here'?" 'said Kate.&#xD;
8'\~That will l~e say, sure enough," answered Blanche..&#xD;
"I have an idea he will not think it as amusing as we&#xD;
do.' Indeed, Katydid,'I expect we ~h~~r get two scold-&#xD;
ings for coming here- one from Frank, and: the other&#xD;
from Mamma."&#xD;
"Do yoi~ think ~o ?~ Then we had better return as&#xD;

rest a little first. My arms really ache. Don~t yours ?"&#xD;
"Yes~yonder cQmes GleucOc."&#xD;
As she spoke Frank's great Newfoundland dog&#xD;
emerged from the bushes on t:he other ~ide the river,&#xD;
'and plnn-ging into the water, swam ovcr to the island.'&#xD;
"If we should be in 'danger of drowning,. he ca~i~&#xD;
save us," said Kate, 1a~ughing. "Wh-atafright you&#xD;
are, Glenco," she continued, as he ran up to them,&#xD;
all dripjiing -hi's us~a1ly ~ilken ci1rl~ clinging wet and&#xD;
sleek to his sides. They both' sprang to their feet and&#xD;
retreated in 'haste, to avoid th~ shower of water he&#xD;
was preparing to shake'off.&#xD;

floating hastily' down the stream; it ~having already&#xD;

"Rather than stay here all night, and frighten&#xD;
them all to de~th~-for ~they would be certain to&#xD;

she was about to influi&amp;amp;~. *lBy the exercise of sorhe Iit~.&#xD;

hold of Edward's arm, to prevent retreat on hi's part, -&#xD;
Kate said solemnly~" II have absemb1~d you together&#xD;
this morning, my~ friends "-both started and looked&#xD;
at her in utter amazementbut sh~wen.t on with ex-&#xD;
emplary gravity, though the spark1i~g mischief of the&#xD;
dark eye, and a mirthful quiver~bout the lijs, were&#xD;
notLn the best ~ I say I have&#xD;
managed to get you together at last, to remonstrate&#xD;

each other. No,. no; Edwaid, do-don't go !" she&#xD;
proceeded rapidI~-...d'ropj~ing her serio-.coyhic tone for&#xD;
her natural manner~".Pray listen to me. !" And she&#xD;
held him with J~oth hands so fast,- thatije would have&#xD;
been compelled to exert no small amount ofrudc&#xD;
strer~gth to disengage himself from her ck~sp-.-.seeiug&#xD;
which, he remained passive. Blanche never thought&#xD;
of moving~buv sat dumb and aghast, while J{~te we~nt&#xD;
on, ~aying~" What ~s the reason you are always&#xD;
blushing and shying, at each other a~ you 'd'~? Where&#xD;
is the sense of it? I assure you, Blanche, that Ed-&#xD;

She suddenly ran aci:oss the ro~m, quick asthou'ght4,&#xD;
Qpened the door, Sprang through, shut azid locked it;&#xD;

iill before either Edward or Blanche had relaxed-one&#xD;
mu~c1e from the attitude&amp;amp; in which they h~d been l~t-&#xD;
ening to her.        -&#xD;
The click of the lock broke the spell that was upon&#xD;
both, and Blanche was about to rise precipitate1~ from&#xD;
her seat, when she perceived that Edward was so in-i-&#xD;
mediately before her, almost touching her dress, that&#xD;
to pass huiii, wduld be impossible;' and he did not seem&#xD;
at all inclined to move. After starting forward, there-&#xD;
fore, she sank back again in her seat-an exy ressi~n&#xD;
of ihingled chagrin, wonder and distress on er fac~e.&#xD;
She was in despair, actually! What 'must Edward&#xD;
Think of her? That she had abetted Kate's plan for&#xD;
taking his acquaintance by ~torrn?'&#xD;
I~dw~ird on hi~ part had determined that the oppor-&#xD;
tunity should uot be lost; he resolved to speak. But&#xD;
while the words he would fain have uttered, died&#xD;
upon hi~ lips, a gay voice wa~ hear&amp;amp; without, and&#xD;
Fran1~, attempting to open rthc 'door, ceased huiiuming&#xD;
hiss favorite opera air to wonder what was the matter&#xD;
with it. He twisted, he turned, the bo t-'all to no&#xD;
purpose. "Why 'the dooi is locked !" he exclaiiiwd&#xD;
aloud-noticing that the key was not in it.&#xD;
At this exclamatioi~B1anche involuntary glanced up&#xD;
at Edward, ~ind the look sh~'inet in return did not tei-id&#xD;
to relieve her confusion. Eyes sometimes are very&#xD;
e1oqu~nt.-1.-and Edward's expressed~ plainly what his&#xD;
lips refused to speak: ii~tcrest--adrniration-loVe!&#xD;
She turned from him; pushed the' table hastily aside,&#xD;
and flew rather~ than glided across the rooms to an-&#xD;

Kate went .to bed satisfied ; nor did she~ long stay&#xD;
awake to lament her brother' s absence. Her soft,&#xD;
regular breathing'soon told Blanche that she slept;&#xD;
but it was in vain Blanche shut her eyes: and tried to-&#xD;
emulate so good an example. Despite every effort of&#xD;
'~resistance, she could not but d~elI on the thought of&#xD;
*Edward's departure. She was not in love with him,&#xD;
assuredlyj she did not even like him,, she believed;.&#xD;
but she was very conscious of an interest regarding&#xD;
him that might easily have glided into' liking.-per-&#xD;
haps love. His face haunted her as no other face had;&#xD;
and that the tones of his voicewere pleasant to her ear,&#xD;
-she needed no better eVidence ,th~n that of the quick-&#xD;
cued puls~tion they had latterlyA'ailed notto produce.&#xD;
And then only twq -day~ before, she believed itc~r-&#xD;
tam that he lOved her! Beforethat she had struggled&#xD;
against indulging a single thought of him; but there&#xD;
was something very captivating in the i.4ea of, li-is Si-&#xD;
lent devotion. She had been mistaken~ of course-&#xD;
and she upbraided herself bitterly for the vanity ~y&#xD;
whIch she had been misle~d. She must banish all re~&#xD;
collection. of him fron&amp;amp; her mind ;~ fortunately, his&#xD;
image had not yet taken possession of h~r heart, ~&#xD;
thought. He was gone-.-and there was an end of the&#xD;
little romance she had half uncons.cious~1y cjierished'.&#xD;
She ~congratulated herself that she would have no&#xD;
embarrassing meeting to dread on to-morrow, or to-&#xD;
morrow, or to-morrow:; at which comfortable reflec-.&#xD;
non she wept heartily; and finally went.to sleep, after&#xD;
wishj ng 'for the first time that her mother had not&#xD;
married-and that sh~ had never: seen Edward Cier-&#xD;

he looked up in surprise;&#xD;

he burst into a fit of laughter as he said, pointing to&#xD;
*the other:&#xD;
'It is Lorimer t took!',&#xD;
Blanche did look, ,just in time to see Kate reach&#xD;
the advancing gentleman and throw herself into hi~&#xD;
arms, or rather throw her arms around him, with the&#xD;
most affectionate empres~ment, kissing him repeatedly,&#xD;
at the same time.&#xD;
'What did' you stay away so long for, Frank,&#xD;
darling?' she exclaimed with caressing~ reproach,&#xD;
Landj&#xD;
She stopped suddenly, struck with some strange-&#xD;
ness in, Prank's manner, and, '~drawing back- a~dittle,&#xD;
koked in his face. More bewildered than Blanche&#xD;
-had been - a moment before, she* stood transfixed,&#xD;
until roi~ sed by the Voice of the reaLFrank behind~-her,&#xD;

'Lorinier, allow me .to present -you to my sister,&#xD;

could not forbear adding. - - -&#xD;
Poor. Kate, comprehending~ jno.W instantly her - mis.&#xD;
take, turned all sorts of colors, and. seemed- on the&#xD;
point of bursting into tears. She hid her fac, on&#xD;
Bltinche7s shoulder.&#xD;
-' Why, Katinka, darling, why should you mind it&#xD;
so?' whispered Blanche, who, if it had beeti-herseif,&#xD;
wou~4 have Ieen equally 'distressed. 'It w~' the&#xD;
most natural mistake in the- wo~ld2. I am sure- I&#xD;

put such an idea itito your head ? It seems very&#xD;

'Why sQ? I have long entertained it."'&#xD;
She looked in his face-with unfeigned amazement.&#xD;

'Because- I am exceedingly 'perplexed, and a little.&#xD;

seldom even changing' tWe position in which -she- had&#xD;
first placed herself; occasionally swallowing, distaste-&#xD;
fully, a few morsels of the'~food pressed on-her by Ju-&#xD;
anita, buL more. frequently declining it by ~a silent&#xD;
- motion of the ha.ind.. Juanita had been not less -~ur-&#xD;
prised- than delighted at the readiness with wI~ich&#xD;
shehad -answered Edward's: request to see her, and&#xD;
now -pz~ep~red- to accompany him to the hotel. He left&#xD;
her in the carriage for a few. minutes, while he went&#xD;
to procure rooms, then returned- and conducted her&#xD;
int~-t~be house.&#xD;
'1 thought,. Miss -Yarassa,' -he said, a sthey followed&#xD;
a sery4nt 'up a flight of stairs, 'that' your Would prefer&#xD;
to retire immediately. I will myself call. on General&#xD;

- ered slightly. 'Yes, I had -rather not see him 'until&#xD;

stopped and' threw' open a door.&#xD;
-' Good night,? said Edward, as Ximena withdrew&#xD;
her. hand - from. his ann, and ~vas about .to enter the&#xD;
~ 'My room;isjust'opposite. Ifybu ~hou-ld&#xD;

'Good night. You are Tvery kind,' said Xirnena.&#xD;
She turned away.&#xD;
He went to enquirer about, her unele. The clerk,&#xD;
on -consultix~g -his book, told him that there was no&#xD;
General Wal-wortli in the hotel. There 'was an-A.&#xD;
H. Walworth, and- -a George D. ~Walworth. Perhaps&#xD;
one of these was. the gentleman he' was- in search of.&#xD;
Edward too-k out his note-book tif be certain as- to&#xD;
-the name. No; he~ was afraid not. j The- name was&#xD;
Cenera~ Amher8t Walw6rth. The clerk suggested that&#xD;
the- gentleman might possibly have left off his tifle,&#xD;
and put in hismiddle name,- 'thus causing a difference&#xD;
of address.. Edward did ~not think this likely under&#xD;
the circumstances; but -it ~was easy to ascertain -&#xD;
whether it was so. Obtaining the number of -A. II.&#xD;
Walworth's room, h&amp;amp; prot~eeded thither, accompanied&#xD;
by a servant, to whom he gave his eard, desiring him.&#xD;
to knock at' the door, take the card. irf to the gentle-&#xD;
man, and sar that he ~wi~hed to speak -to him for' a&#xD;
momei~t on very partirn~ilar business, if'he h&amp;amp;d i~ot re-&#xD;
tired. A crack of light under the door showed that&#xD;
there was- a. light burning in the room, so that Ed-&#xD;
ward felt no hesitation about intruding.&#xD;
* The first knock of the ~servant received no atten-&#xD;
ti5n. lie knocked again.&#xD;
'What do you want, and be d~-d to you?' was&#xD;
the' civil demand from within. - -&#xD;
'Here's- a gentleman- wants-to se~ you on very-pa'-&#xD;
ti~'lar business, sir,'' responded the servant. -&#xD;
'I never -'do business at twelve o'clock at night, tell&#xD;
thegentleman,' was -the cool reply.&#xD;
Edward smiled, as it occurred to - him for the first&#xD;
-time -that it would~-pefhaps, have been more sensible&#xD;
to have -deferred his search until the next day, but- he&#xD;
concluded that he might as Well -satisfy himself as to&#xD;

whether thjs was the man he sough~; so he'said to the&#xD;
grinning servant:&#xD;
'Ask himif he is General Walwortlkof Kentucky?'.&#xD;
'The gentleman says, is you General Walworth, of&#xD;
Kei~tucky ?' bawled the servant.&#xD;
There was no Verbal answer;' but there was. the&#xD;
sudden movement of a chair, as if dome ones had&#xD;
risen hastily-a step passed across the room, the door&#xD;
Was unlocked and opened with a jerk, and a young&#xD;
man, with light disordered hair, flushed face, and al-&#xD;
together ;a very dissipated look, st'&amp;amp;od before edward&#xD;
in ft owning impatience.&#xD;
Now Edward, though very shy with women, had&#xD;
never been troubled with the least diffidence towards&#xD;
any onb of his own sex;' and .as A. H. Walwortli's&#xD;
glance met his quiet eye, and~rested on the half smile&#xD;
of 'his lip, that gentleman's manner modified itself&#xD;
considerably. in the same instant, Edward himself&#xD;
recollected that some apology Wa's due for his mistake&#xD;
and 'untimely intrusion. He therefore'bowed, 1~egged&#xD;
pardon for having disturbed Mr. Walwortli, in conse-&#xD;
quence of a misapprehension, the nature of which he&#xD;
briefly explained, bowed again and retired to~ his&#xD;
chamber, sati~fled that he had better delay all further&#xD;
inquiries concerning General Walworth until he could&#xD;
prosecute them to'more advantage9 It was 'possible,&#xD;
he reflected, that he had mistaken the hotel at which&#xD;
'the General. was-to meet his relatives. The name, he&#xD;
was. sure, he had right, as he had taken a note qf it&#xD;
at the time.. He supposed he should be able to find&#xD;
himout in the morning. It would be decided1 em-&#xD;
barrassing if' he did not. What,' in that case, eould&#xD;
he do with the, young lady ?~ He went to sleep jon~&#xD;
during this question.&#xD;
The first thing he did next morning, after dressing,&#xD;
* was to send and inquire about Miss Yarassa's health,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

~" A~. ~&#xD;

U&#xD;
&#xD;
and ask at what hour he should be iii attendance to&#xD;
accompany'her to breakfast. 'This was really very&#xD;
II in a young gentleman who had' never before so&#xD;
much as. asked a young lady to dance, far less to go&#xD;
to breakfast with him. He smiled as' this thought&#xD;
occurred to himself~ while waiting for the answer to&#xD;
hi~ message; and to beguile the time, walked up&#xD;
to ~he looking-glass and gave an additional brush-&#xD;
ing to' the glossy waves of his dark hair, remarking,&#xD;
for the first time, that he was much sunburnedd.&#xD;
Leaning toward the mirror, he~ scanned his face closely,&#xD;
then began to brush his bearcV hard and fast. It was&#xD;
a beard to' he vainof! Black, curling, and very thick.&#xD;
He had long worn a moustachee; ~ut this. beard was&#xD;
of Mexican growth, and, like' all Mexican vegetable&#xD;
productions, of tropical iuxuriaiice. Before he had&#xD;
finished arranging it to his satisfaction, Thomas re-&#xD;
turned.. Miss Yarassai' s compliment~ and thinks-&#xD;
she was quite well, but would 'breakfast in her own&#xD;

ransacking his brains for half 'an hour for something&#xD;
to say to her )at table. 'As she was a foreigner, the&#xD;
peculiarities of climate and' ~the customs of the Cres-&#xD;
cent City were, perhaps, the most prominent subject for&#xD;
conversatfon. He had concluded to ask her if she&#xD;
had. ever seen as damp a day before; intending to in-&#xD;
form her, then, that the days. were often, in fact&#xD;
generally, extremely damp ~in New Orleans ; that it&#xD;
was a delightful' city, hut bad climate; that there are&#xD;
.ly two feet of mud before .you co~m~ to the water-&#xD;
in conseqne~ice of which; people are buried, not in&#xD;

just as he was about to enter the hotel, he bethdught&#xD;
him. that his best plan would be to haiid hi~ list to a&#xD;

~ Hi's post-office?'&#xD;
'Verdevale, county, 'Kentucky.'&#xD;

Edward put up hi~ tablets. He was was amazed at&#xD;
her perfect unconsciousness, or noncha1ance~be did&#xD;
not know which it ~w~s~-in so awkward a positi~n.&#xD;
'I wonder if the man is a myth.?' he eja~milated&#xD;
mentally:, 'and' if this pretty insensible is to be left&#xD;
on my hands altogether? What am I to ~do with&#xD;
her?'&#xD;
*He glanced at her again. She was looking straight&#xD;
before her, evidently forgetful of his presence, and&#xD;
the'expression of her large dark eye was so mourn-&#xD;
ful that the half-sentiiy~ent' of impatience which had&#xD;
been excited by what he considered her stupidity&#xD;
was instantly checked by a gush of generosity and&#xD;
pity. For the first' time he felt, what almost any&#xD;
other man would have '~felt long before, a seiise of,&#xD;
protection and proprietorship towards the lonely and'&#xD;
~Iovely girl thus accidentally entrusted to his care.&#xD;
~nd, after all, he thought, a&amp;amp; he still looked at her&#xD;
pale impasgve face 'and sad unmoving gaze-after&#xD;
all, how much more sen~ib1e ~n d less troublesome to&#xD;
him this quiet and. undem6nstrative manner ~f tak'ihg&#xD;
the disappointment than would 'be the noisy excite-&#xD;
ment which most women and girls would display, he&#xD;
supposed, on such an occasion. ' It was~ with a gen-&#xD;
tleness as well~ as kindness that he said, as he rose-&#xD;
to leave her: 'At all events, ~ [iss' Y~assa, I hope&#xD;
you will, not give yourself the, least distress or unea-&#xD;

sider. if General Walworth did ~iot~.appearthe nex ,&#xD;
day or the day after, he wou!ct wait no longer ,&#xD;
believed, but must, yes, lie must take Miss .Yarassa&#xD;
home with 'him. That would certainly be bitter than&#xD;
remaining at the hotel, though it would be very dis-&#xD;
ao'reeable and eiyibarrassing to her he feared. He&#xD;
knew jt.~~~ld. be ~6Ao himself. Perhaps she mighI~&#xD;
object to going, and wish himto take her on to Ken-&#xD;
tucl y. He hoped not, rind thought not-she seemed&#xD;
so passive afid indifferent. Altogether, it was a-&#xD;
a very unp1e~s~nt dilemma in which he was placed.&#xD;
lie resumed his pen, and continued' his sentence-~&#xD;
would b~ at home on. Saturday. It was possible that&#xD;
the young lady might accompany him, as there&#xD;

to meet him.&#xD;

he thought of the annoy&amp;amp;nces he must encounter 'in&#xD;

minutes-and he ought surely to have been satisfied&#xD;
with such unusual expedition. -jl3ut he had not~ in&#xD;
the meantime, escaped notice. His- face was aflame&#xD;
I with confusion, and his manner very forbiddingly&#xD;
haughty, as he led Miss Yarassa to the ~carriage,&#xD;
handed her in, and, following~ with all eQuvenietit&#xD;
[speed himself, drove away~ leaving Thomas to provide&#xD;
for the ~onveyance of the rest of the party.&#xD;
He leaned back in his corner, and glanced over at&#xD;
his fair companion as she reclineil in hers, curibu~ to&#xD;
discover whether' she had observed and understood&#xD;
the smiles and look~ so intelligible to himself. It&#xD;
was plain thAt she ~had not. Sh~ was as pale and&#xD;
numoved' as usual. By this ti-me he had grown&#xD;
to consider her as.a breathing automaton, upon whom&#xD;
words would be wasted. Their drive of ten miles&#xD;
passed in absolute silence. He was thinking of the&#xD;
cha~g~s that had. occurred since he left home., It&#xD;
Was less than - two years, and yet how great. were&#xD;
these~ changes! Lucy, Kate, Frank; all married--and&#xD;
his step-mother dead! And Blanch~I he could meet&#xD;
her now, as the wife of his brother,-with composure.&#xD;
His ill-starred love troubled him no more. l$ut,&#xD;
looking back in the calm spirit with which we can&#xD;
regard things that are of the past, he rejoiced that&#xD;
he had checked it. in its early growth by absence,&#xD;
and that a sense of m6ral right, as well aeo'f hono~'&#xD;
towards his brother, had enabled him later to conquer&#xD;
it entirely, for he felt that it had been, th~4 it would*~&#xD;
ever remain the one passion ofThis life. Had it taken.&#xD;
firmer root in his heart, he might have been a miser-&#xD;
~1e man. As it was, though he knew that he could&#xD;
flOV~~ love again, that his life must be a cold, unge~&#xD;

CHAPTER XXT.&#xD;

They had left' S carsborough late, and it Was now&#xD;
sQmep~me ~aftet~ 4dark. The hail 'door w~s open-the&#xD;
lamp. b~ifrning~verythiii~ looking just as usual. And&#xD;
yet Edward felt the'~ chang~. There. was' a stillness,&#xD;
an 'air.hid.escribable, but oppressive, hanging over the&#xD;
place. No~ ~ ha'ZI' heard their approach~,. it seemed,&#xD;
as'riot eyea a servafit came to meet them. Edward&#xD;
*   crossed the hall, passed through  a ccirridor, and&#xD;
stopped a moment~ at the sitting-room door. Ic was&#xD;
*   opefr~ and h&amp;amp; could l&amp;amp;ok in on the f~Anily so reduced&#xD;
in irn~bers since l~e had joined' them last around the&#xD;
table ~Wh~i~they now sat .~t' tea. Only three-his&#xD;
father, Fraiik ~nd Blanche 1&#xD;
Mr.' Cl&amp;amp;j~ili&amp;amp;s: back wa~to the door, and Edward's&#xD;
eye ~i'ested btit art instant on the familiar fQrm, which,&#xD;
as he' saw it, looked unaltered, and passiji~g 'Pr~~&#xD;
with a slight moinentar~r glance, paused at the o ST&#xD;
end &amp;amp;f the table. Blanche? NV&amp;amp;s it really d 0&#xD;

S&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed to. him a ~tranger. While h~ involuntarily&#xD;
shaded his sight to &amp;amp;btain a clearer vision, a siigl~t&#xD;
movement of Ximena's, as she stood beside him, re-&#xD;
called his wandering thoughts. Without allowing&#xD;
himself time for further hesitation, he entered the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Blanche saw him first. At her slight exclamation,&#xD;
Frank looked up, and rose quickly from the table, &amp;amp;nd&#xD;
I~Ir.' C lerville, turning liis head. awl perceiving' him',&#xD;
started up too. Ximena remained standing near the&#xD;
door as Edward hastened forward to meet them. A&#xD;
few broken words were interch&amp;amp;nged as they gr~spQd&#xD;
each other's hand-and then Edward turned to&#xD;
Blanche. She 'had risen, and stood, her hand ex-&#xD;
tended, as he' approached. Neither spoke. * The .sight&#xD;
of her pale face and black dress shocked Edward in-&#xD;
expressiblY; and as she felt. the convulsive trembling&#xD;
of his han~1, she ~ould.'s~rcClY maintain~the foree4&#xD;
composure for which she w~s struggling. Ed~&#xD;
ward bent his head over h~r hand, and his tears feW&#xD;
upon~it, as he pressed it to his lip's. It was the mute&#xD;
assurance 'of his sympathy in her sorrow-for~ all this&#xD;
moment there was n6 thought, even ~his heart,~ave&#xD;
for the kind mother who was gone.&#xD;
Mr. Olerville and Frank both glanced at Ximena,&#xD;
and the, former took a 'step towards her, saying to&#xD;
Edward-&#xD;
* 'Have you brought :tne.anoth~r daughWr, my son?'&#xD;
Then let me welcome her home."'&#xD;
'Oh! pardon. me!' exclaimed Edward, quickly.&#xD;
No,' father:; this ,,yoflng lady-' he huri~ied to her&#xD;
si  and said, 'Allow m~ to present to you my father&#xD;

tei~ce by placing the' passive hand he held in that of&#xD;
Blanche,. Who pressed it very 'cordially, murmured&#xD;
some words of welcc.me,. and drew Ximena to' 'a '6hair,&#xD;
saying gently, 'Sit down and let me take off your&#xD;

'Ximeua. submitted. without opposition, and Dianche&#xD;

Blanche mentally echoed- Kate's'~ opinion, ,that he was&#xD;
the strangest person she ever ~a-w inter life.&#xD;
Despite her efforts and those of 1\fr. Clerville and&#xD;
Frank, conversation languished. In fact, none of&#xD;
them knew what to talk' about. Edward seemed to&#xD;
avoid speaking of- Mexico, they all noticed. lie was&#xD;
ahiiost as silent as Ximena. Shortly after tea was&#xD;
over, Blanche a~ked her guest if she would like to&#xD;
retire- and Ximena answering affirmatively, they left&#xD;
the room.1 Summoning, the maid, BTh~nche led the&#xD;

'You are his sistt~r?' she asked.&#xD;
'You mean-'&#xD;
'Edwatd's. You call him Edward, I thought.'&#xD;
'Yes-that i~ his name,7 'answered Blanche, won-&#xD;

~'And you are his sister?'&#xD;
'Not his own sister?' replied Blanche in a faltering&#xD;

'His brother's wife?'&#xD;
'No :-his step sister.' Teats sprang t~her eyes.&#xD;

Blanche's tears gushed forth. Sh~ had been bat-&#xD;

'~But how can' you weep. so-?' exclaimed Ximena in&#xD;
a tone of surprise-~-almost of envy. 'I cannot weep:&#xD;
I have knot shed a 'tear since' my mother died!'&#xD;
Blanche pressed her hand. -&#xD;

Before Blanche could answer, Ximena s eye ~acci-&#xD;
dentally fell upon the ~et rosary. Which' the former&#xD;
wore depen*ng from her girdle-and which', she had&#xD;
taken in her hand while Ximena Was spe~king. Evi-&#xD;

~ Give it me! give it me!' cried her young mistress,&#xD;
in .English. 'Give me myflio~ther's rosary 1'&#xD;
Unwillingly, as it seemed, Juanita pr9duced it from&#xD;
among the folds of the kerchIef 'that covered her bo-&#xD;

itup to the light. It was o~ 'lapis lasuli, 8et in gold,&#xD;

the passion of grief which had so long been prisoner,&#xD;
asi twere~ within her breast, burst forth with fearfUl&#xD;

week, I forget which-before they left Mexico; but&#xD;
it was to be kept a secret-' here Blanche, who h~~d&#xD;
scarcely. heard the commencement' of Jenny's sen-&#xD;
tence, turned round, and listened with an expression&#xD;
of surprise and doubt,. as the girl continued-Jbut III&#xD;
thought -it very strange that Mass Edward should be&#xD;
sitting down stairs there so quiet, arid her goiri~ on sp&#xD;
up here, if she was his wife!'&#xD;
Blanche could 'notforbear a smile, while at tha same&#xD;
time therehad ~been something so very unusual about&#xD;
the whole affair-Edward's sIdden and unexpected&#xD;
appearance, thus accompanied-that for a moment&#xD;
the question did occur to her whether what Thom~ts&#xD;
said might not be true. But she instantly effectedd&#xD;
that i~ was impossible Edward should act in so- insiw&#xD;
core, a nianner towards, his fathe~'-and-pshaw! how&#xD;
could she credit it for a moment!&#xD;
"And pray, did your Mass Edward give Th6inas&#xD;
leav~ to tell you ~lzis secret, that is to be kept from&#xD;
every one else 2' she said1 ~valkiug quickly down stairs,&#xD;
fQllowed by thg .ser~a~t.&#xD;
Oh, he tQld all ot the s5rT~ant~. as ;Tcll ~s inc but&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
TTVEMORS AGAIN.-&#xD;
&#xD;
*    -- As soon as - Blanche and Ximena had retired; Ed~&#xD;
ward explained to his father and~ Frank the chance&#xD;
-~ circumstances by which Xim-ena1 had been tlI!own&#xD;
upon his p-rotection----enquiring ~of the finer if he&#xD;
* rememb~i'ed having been acquainted with the youn~&#xD;
lady's mother.&#xD;
'What did you say the name was?' asked Mr. (Dlei~&#xD;
vil-le. -&#xD;
'Yarassa.' - -&#xD;
~' Her maiden name, I mean.'&#xD;
'Walworth, I suppose.' That is the name of her&#xD;
brothel', whom I could not ftnd.'&#xD;
'Walworth!' repeated Nr, Clerville. 'Oh ,ye~;1&#xD;
recollect now. - Miss Walworth! - She was a schooL&#xD;
mate of your mothers, I think. At least, a fijend of&#xD;
hers. I remerubef. Her parents were ~very much&#xD;
opposed to this marriage ;~ snot from any objection to&#xD;
Yarassa himself, I. believe, but because they naturally&#xD;
objected to his living in Mexico. I think.I heard af-&#xD;
terwards, however~ that they generally resi4d in&#xD;
- Europe-spending very little time in Mexico.'&#xD;
'Miss, Yarassa speaks English like a fiative,' said&#xD;
Edward.                            -&#xD;
'Poor child!' observed4 Frank. "She - miis~, have&#xD;
been very much disappointed and embarrassed at not&#xD;
meeting her uncle in-New Orleans.". -&#xD;
Edward thought, but an impulse -of delicacy pr(~&#xD;
vented hi~ saying, that she Was not half as much dis"&#xD;
appointed and emba~was~cd as he himself had been:&#xD;
He mentioned having written to General Walworth,&#xD;
and asked he father whether he supposed' it ~&#xD;
be neca~aary to write~ again~&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I thuiik so,' was the reply. And meanwhile I&#xD;
hope Blanche can make her contented to remain here.&#xD;
I am very gla~d, my son, that accident enabled y~u to&#xD;
render this service to the daughter of your mother's&#xD;
friend.'&#xD;
Blanche here entered ~the room, and heard the his-&#xD;
tory qf Edward's protectorship of Ximena, relating, in&#xD;
return, the sudden paroxysm of grief into whidi- the&#xD;
~ poor girl ha~'fall~n a.t~he sight of her mother's ros-&#xD;
~ ary. WithouKdoubt EdWard. shared to some extent&#xD;
~ the sentiments of compassion sb warmly expressed&#xD;
by his father, Blanche arid Frank for the apparentlyy&#xD;
friendless cpndition and sad bereavement of the&#xD;
young orphan; but he, nevertheless, could not help&#xD;
thinkihg- what a fortunate thing it was for him that&#xD;
this paroxysm did not occur --on board the vessel as&#xD;
they were crossing the gulf, or at the hotel, or on the&#xD;
boat c~miiig up the river. Such a circumstance&#xD;
[*6uld i~ave complicated his embarrassments ~greatly&#xD;
was rejoiced that the young lady was safely trans-&#xD;
ferred~ from his hands to those of Blanche. lie&#xD;
glanced at them-her hands-as this thought crossed&#xD;
his mind, and gave a quick start-~on1y just restrain-&#xD;
ing the exclamation that rose to his lips. Just then&#xD;
Blanc-he rose, and, paying she would return to Xi-&#xD;
mena, bade them' all good night. Edward was so&#xD;
absorbed in hi&amp;amp;own reflections that he entirely for-&#xD;
- got ~* acknowledge and return the salutation until&#xD;
after she had left the room.&#xD;
lie was thinking-thinking of-her hand. There&#xD;
was no wedding ring upon -it I A m~gnificeizit dia-&#xD;
mond blazed uvon her engagement finger, but wed.k&#xD;
ding ri~ig there wa~ not! Could it be possible that&#xD;
they were uta married yet? He had taken it for&#xD;
granted that they were, because Mrs. Clervill&amp;amp;'~ death&#xD;
had- noU occurred until some tiPie after the date set for&#xD;

*   the marriage.' Could anything have happened t~&#xD;
prevent it before that? He hoped not! lie did hon-&#xD;
estiy~and earnestly hope not! For since' it was fated&#xD;
that she could hot be 'his, he wished the barrier that&#xD;
would separate them forever to be erected at once.&#xD;
So loi~g ~.s he had considered her actually the wife of&#xD;
Frank, ~he had' been resigtied, had thought. hi~ '1~ve&#xD;
was extinct but no sooner did he entertain a doubt&#xD;
on the subject, than the same love blazed up again&#xD;
furiously. It' had been covered, it seemed, but not&#xD;
extinguished~ by the ashes of despair. If thoae&#xD;
ashes had rainedd undistubed, no dQubt it would&#xD;
have died out-in time ; but stirred up, and pushed&#xD;
aside by this discovery, the fire 'had free vent' again.&#xD;
Frank and his father talked -on; he answered like&#xD;
one in a dream; sometimes blundering upon the&#xD;
sense of what they said, ahd ansWering per~tinently-&#xD;
but oftener giving response so wide of the nark, that&#xD;
they began to suspect his thoughts to be with Ms fairs&#xD;
traveling companion~Â±particularly as he every now&#xD;
and then looked around' nervously at the door, and&#xD;
once asked Frank, quite abruptly, if it was not pro-&#xD;
baJ~1e that Blanche would be down again that night.~&#xD;
r)       Frank said he supposed not, as she had bidden them&#xD;
good-night; adding thaI~ h&amp;amp; hoped ~IVJiss Yarassa had&#xD;
become composed before this time. Edward blushed&#xD;
withv-exatioii, as he perceived that' he wa~ c6nsid~&#xD;
ered to beAn great anxiety about Miss ~ara~sa..&#xD;
At length, to his great relief, 'Mr. Clerville remark-&#xD;
ing that it was late, rose to retir~. Edward' willingly&#xD;
bade' him good-~ight, bu~ 'was not so ready tc~pa1~'t&#xD;

*&#xD;
ner to disclaim the implied impeachment, breakfast&#xD;
was ready-the opportuHity lost.&#xD;
During the whole of breakfast, his face was a per~&#xD;
nianeht erimsqn. Dr. iEldridge~ met him very cor-&#xD;
dially, and naturally supposing that ha would be as&#xD;
much concerned about the young lady-whom he&#xD;
understood to be under his care-as the rest of the&#xD;
family were, began to assure him he hoped there wa~&#xD;
nothing serious to be apprehended in her case, but&#xD;
that, a~ he had no pressing call elsewhere, he should&#xD;
remain during the day to watch the symptoms.~ Jie&#xD;
thGught it~rob~ble that fever might come on towards&#xD;
evening , but he trusted it could 1.ie easily managed.&#xD;
Much more he said, which~Edward did not hear. The&#xD;
doctor; observing his embarrassment at the first men-&#xD;
tion of Miss Yarassa, instantly came to the same con~&#xD;
clusion the others had; and though he was too'well&#xD;
bred to alhide, either directly 6r indirectly, to it, his&#xD;
smile and the tone of his remarks wt~r~ not to be&#xD;
mi~sun4erstood. Edward sat indignant, but, alas I&#xD;
speechless. Under similar circumstances, Frank&#xD;
would have extricated himself from the suspicion with-&#xD;
out the least difficulty by simply informing them all&#xD;
of their mistake. But there is the"misf~rtune of your&#xD;
diffident man. Speech andy ideas always fail him&#xD;
just at his utmost need. Edward knew that if he at-&#xD;
tempted an explanation he would stammer and blush&#xD;
so that it would make bad worse. He was compelled&#xD;
to en~.ure his wrongs in silence.&#xD;
lie left the breakfast table &amp;amp;S; soon as he pos~ib1y&#xD;
could, strode iudignantly into tI~fe iibr~iry, and began&#xD;
hastily, to invite. a letter.. A ver~.bj'ief and not over&#xD;
courteous communication to ti~neral Walworth it&#xD;
W8S. He felt~ dowu~ight savage at being judged~ and&#xD;
,conyie~ted of a passion of which he was peufec~lY&#xD;
gigitless, and was determin'~&amp;amp;thM At s~o~ld ~ot be&#xD;

&#xD;
his fault it' he was not: delivered from the imputation&#xD;
by the speedy departure of the object of his supposed&#xD;
admiration.. He was joined by Frank as he was&#xD;
putting ~ the document.&#xD;
'Is that a death warrantt you are folding ?''said&#xD;
Frank, with a smile. 'You look as stern and reso-&#xD;
lute as if it was.'&#xD;
'No, it is merely a     iiI~s letter,' he replied,&#xD;
placing it in 'an envelope. Taking a p~en, he hastily&#xD;
dashed oW the direction.&#xD;
'General Walworth,' paid Frank, leaning ~ver his&#xD;
* shoulder to read it; '~your fair Creole'~ uncle, I sup-&#xD;
pose? But would it not be better~, Edward, for my&#xD;
father to write to hix~? Let me see what you have&#xD;
said, will you?'&#xD;
He took the letter from Ed\vard's hand, openeded it,&#xD;
* glanced over the very few lines' it contained, and&#xD;
looked at his brother in surprise.&#xD;
'Why, my 'dear fellow, this will never do! ~So&#xD;
eold-it is scare ely civil! The man des'~rves no b~t-&#xD;
ter, I grant you, if it is by hi~ vQhintary fault that&#xD;
he has been so neglectful, but" think of th~ young&#xD;

may probably have known this man. hitns~1f. At all&#xD;

Do you think so?'&#xD;

Hepaused, as Edward lookedup with~an excl~ma..&#xD;

claimedmd hastily, ~ that you Would not commit the&#xD;

There is no o&amp;amp;asion to be' alarihed, I hope and&#xD;
believe,' answered he; but send certainly., if you&#xD;
'~hin&amp;amp;it necessary.'&#xD;
Re bowed and retired; while Blanche sat down and&#xD;
wrote off the directions he had given her,4 in order to&#xD;
be sure that she did not forget them. She then. went&#xD;
back up stairs, and remained there until sumironed&#xD;
to tea.&#xD;
"You are not going to sit up again to-n~ight,&#xD;
Blanche?' said Frank, as she rose 'from table.&#xD;
'Yes. You know I' have the ve~'atrum to give. I&#xD;
should be afraid to trust the dropping of that even to&#xD;
Morn ~I~nnah, careful as she is. She has not a steady&#xD;

Xi~ena while she is so ill.' -&#xD;
8he started as~slxe. uttered the last word, an4 looked&#xD;
aj~rehensively ~t Edward, as if she ~vas sorry she had&#xD;
said it. ,Frank was standing beside ber,~ and' laid his&#xD;
hand on her hiringg tresses,. with more of a brotherly&#xD;
than lover-like solicitu4e. of manner..&#xD;
'You will be madi ill yourselff, I fear, by such un-&#xD;
accustomed fatigue,' he said.&#xD;
'Oh! ~no; there is not the least danger. I slept~&#xD;
nearly all the afternoon, and am quite fresh now.&#xD;
Good-night; papa. F scarcely think I shall be down&#xD;
~g~in; good-night, Edward.'&#xD;
~S.he pl&amp;amp;ed her hand on Frank~s arm, and rnoyed&#xD;
towards thedoor, as Mr. Clervide and Edward re~&#xD;
poundedd to her good-night. The former begged her&#xD;
aot.to incur any unnecessary fatigue ~ir exposnr&amp;amp;~&#xD;
wished he 'could ~ssigt her in watching. as lie, tc'c&#xD;
was apprehensive her health might suffer from her&#xD;

in'g a moment as she reached the door' and lookiiig&#xD;
back with a smile.&#xD;
Edward's eye had been following her retiring form;&#xD;
but he withdrew it r~ow with a double 'pang. Her&#xD;
easy familiarity ~with Frank, as she drew him out of&#xD;
the room; despite all his efforts to resist the eniotion;&#xD;
filled his ~heart with jealous jain; and, whexi she&#xD;
turned and smiled,, the ~' subdued expression of h~&#xD;
countenance&amp;amp; was so different to its former unsh~&#xD;
dowed joyousness, that there was a sudden throb in&#xD;
his throat and moisture in his eye.&#xD;
Blanche stoPped as soon as. she and Frank were~in&#xD;
the hall.&#xD;
"Did s6~ ask Dr. EldriCge '~ Do you thimk he 'con-&#xD;
sidered her dangerously ill?' she inquired eagerly,,&#xD;
butinalow tone.'           ''&#xD;
'Why no,' answered Frank. He does not consider&#xD;
her dangerously ill. He told me distinctly that thera&#xD;
is no cause for alarm. You are nervous, II expect,&#xD;
from the fatigue and worry of last night, and are.&#xD;
frightening yourself needlessly. Give the medicine&#xD;
to me. I will sit up and measure out the dose at the&#xD;
proper time, and any one can, thn administer it. You&#xD;
said Hannah is to be up, did you not? She can come&#xD;
for it,' or, rather, I will bring it to 'the door to her.&#xD;
YOU must go to bed, Blanche. You certainly ought&#xD;
to be satisfied that between us it will be properly at-&#xD;
tended to. So go to bed, like a good'child'!'&#xD;

half within the circle, and half in the surrounding&#xD;

Blanche removed theNshade, lifted -the lamp, and&#xD;

and the throat, were visible. The left hand,- from the&#xD;

and - gold rosary, supported the cheek. The- black&#xD;
hair escaping from the little' lace cap into which&#xD;
Blanche' had ga~there~ it, was spread over the pillow&#xD;
in luxuriant profusion; and the brows and lashes,'&#xD;
equally black, w~re marvels of delicate 'pencilling;&#xD;
The check was~ blooming -with the 'fever - flush, and&#xD;
the crimson lips. just parted sufficiently to give a&#xD;
- glimpse 'of. teeth 'white as the p~ulp of- the cocoa-nut.&#xD;

'Oh! Frank,' exclaimed Blanche, clasping her&#xD;
hands, "has she taken too much veratrurn?' -'&#xD;
On the contrary, not eno~igh yet, I. believe. She&#xD;
must have the other dose at three- o'clock; as her&#xD;
pulse is still more than a hundred. But, as you oh-&#xD;
served,' it is very weak; ana her strength must n~t be&#xD;
let down too much. I think you. told me she has&#xD;
taken no food to-day?'&#xD;
Not a mors~d, or a drop of anything. I tried in&#xD;
vain ~nd repeatedly, to get her to swallow a 8i~ or&#xD;
two of tea. She would not do it. And Juanita says&#xD;
it ha~ been just.this w~y ever since 1~er mother died-&#xD;
that she has lived on air.'&#xD;

terror 'I As he sprang toWards her she regained hr&#xD;

her. The shade was off the 'la~mp, but the 'net was&#xD;

her face. There was an alarming 'change, in botlu'&#xD;
since he saw' 'her before. The pulse was barely per-&#xD;
ceptible, the face colorle~, and the breath~ig peculiar.'&#xD;
Though a chifl of horror struck to his heart, he en~&#xD;

awake, she florid her head, 'hand's and feet so painful&#xD;
as to shrink at the gentlest touch, and w~s informed&#xD;
that she had only been kept alive by the applications&#xD;
which had reduced tlien~ to that coi~idition.&#xD;
'She is still suffering,' the letter continued, 'with&#xD;
a slow fever, which the 'doctor says is not dangerous,&#xD;

be roused and interested' as it is mental depression,&#xD;
far mere than bodily illness, which is the matter with&#xD;

AFTER CLOUDS COME $U~SHTNE.&#xD;
Father Leburn's visit to' Hollywood, which wash to&#xD;
bave been of a few days duration only, was pro-~&#xD;
longed to a month.. Blanche obtained from Dr.' Eld.&#xD;
ridge, on his visit to, Ximena, the rnor~ning after the&#xD;
Priest's arrival, a medkal opinion that, change of air&#xD;
was. absohftely necessary to the speedy-rec~wery of&#xD;
hi~ 2Reverence's health, 'and'as this' opinion was~'gWen&#xD;
sincerely, perfiaps the Priest heeded it somewhat.~&#xD;
Rut a:much greater inducement to him to lengthen&#xD;
his stay .was the' perception 4hat the moral. atmos-&#xD;
ph~ere of 'the house 'ne~ded...brigh~ening.. Mr; Oler&#xD;
yule was always grave now~ his face reminding Father&#xD;
Leburn ~of what it had been for years after the death&#xD;
of his first wife. Blanche was pale, sad~ subdued,&#xD;
~dward was looking thin, haggard and wretched.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I&#xD;
&#xD;
And Fr~.nk, who was the one spring of light and&#xD;
anything Jii~e cheerfulness 'in the house, often now~.&#xD;
reflected in his face at least the thoughtffilness of&#xD;
sorrow. Xhnen'a waR 3yorst ~f all'; in general, per-&#xD;
fectly apathetic; occasionally, almost W~d with 'grief.&#xD;
Wisely and gently, as one' -a&amp;amp;custonied 4o miiP~er-&#xD;
ing to minds diseased, did the Priest set himself tQ&#xD;
the task of corre&amp;amp;ing the evil. He wrought as mudi&#xD;
'by example 'and the unsVudied teachings that fell&#xD;
from his lips as by direct precept and admonition. 11i~&#xD;
manner was ever so ~hflpIy, inno~&amp;amp;ntly cheerful-With&#xD;
nothing in it to sho~k or' offend 'the most sad'den~d&#xD;
spirit, but sootI~ing geffial--~vinning insensibly, first to&#xD;
sympathy, then tQ participation in his childlike submit~&#xD;
sion to, trust in the Father above. Soon 'Mr. Clervi:ll&amp;amp;s&#xD;
brow'. related from its. settled' gravity. Frank was&#xD;
all himself. again. Blanche's step regained its elas-&#xD;
ticity, ~ Taint but most lively color~ began to steal&#xD;
into 'her late pale cheek,,. and her smile, if not so&#xD;
joyous, wa~ "'as bright as of old. Even Ximena, th ough~&#xD;
oppressed at times by the ino~t hopeless anguish,&#xD;
exerted herself', with some '~success, to be patients to&#xD;
some degree" cheerful. '~&#xD;
iITht 'with Edward it was different.&#xD;

era~~e~~an. He. could not study'by' day+-he could&#xD;
riot sleep by night. lie lost all appetitee, and' smoked&#xD;
incessantly. His father's former apprehensions abdut&#xD;
his health were revived in full force, ~.nd he regi'et-&#xD;
ted very much (as 'Edwa~d himself did most heartily)'&#xD;
Wat 'he had' returned home.'. Had he not feared that.&#xD;

would be' dangerous~-~.more: especially as the ~ornit6&#xD;

and, as he was laboi~ing under the very 'i~orst form of&#xD;
the malady with which he was afflicted, a relapse-&#xD;
always. more violent and dangerous than, a first at..&#xD;
tack-he 'was to that degree imfatna1~ed that he could~&#xD;

~s~c4en glances at her facet in the sQund of her voice&#xD;

hei' suddenly one day. She inquired for the first' time&#xD;
about her uncle, General 'Walworth, and appeared as&#xD;

information concerning him 'had been 'received. With&#xD;
far mora decision of manner thant is usually found in&#xD;

a glow of warmth and pleasure, like a sunbeam which&#xD;
illumines all upon which it falls. 2 But there are faces&#xD;
that, like a London fog creeping into a drawing-room,&#xD;
chill, dim and dampen everything around. Edward'~&#xD;

the ~light gene that followed his entrance, they all felt&#xD;
it a relief when he rose. and left the ~partmeiit. His&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
A GLIMPSE BENEATH THE SURFACE. 2&#xD;
It was with no little difficulty that Ximena was&#xD;
pi evaikd upon, by the united arguments and. entree~ 2&#xD;
ties of her friends, to forego her intenti6n of returning&#xD;
to Mexico immediately on her recovery. Mr. Clerville&#xD;
represented the, extreme probability~the positive&#xD;
certainty, he: considered it-that General Walworth&#xD;
had been prevented from receiving the letters ad-&#xD;
dressed to him by absence from home. lIt 2was the&#xD;
season when most Southerners forsake their too sunny&#xD;
hoi5nes for a mountain or r northern climate. He re-~&#xD;
minded her2 that her mother had committedd her to&#xD;
Edward' ~ care, to be delivered to the guardianship of&#xD;
her uncle---of the anxiety which she had mmifes2~ed.&#xD;

&#xD;
to leave a country torn to pieces by civil factions-.&#xD;
asked if Ximena thought that she would wish her&#xD;
daughter to return, thither alone, ii~h en, too, the health&#xD;
of he.r uncle, Don. Miguel, rendered it doubtful whether&#xD;
he would, even if living, be able to afford her prote~-&#xD;
tion in such a land-agd ended' by strongly advising&#xD;
her to wait at least 2 until the fall before condemning&#xD;
General Walworth finally, or believing that he could&#xD;
be guilty of so singular a disregard of tl3e wishes of&#xD;
his sister and welfare of his niece. Blanche asked,&#xD;
with ~ffectionate reproach,. how Ximena could think&#xD;
of leaving her, when she knew she loved her so much?&#xD;
and the doctor, when appealed to on the subject by&#xD;
her, pronounced the scheme altogether inadmissible.&#xD;
The state of her health, the warmth of the season&#xD;
and the existeilce of vomito at V~ra Cruz, all forbade&#xD;
the idea, he said. Instead of this longjourney, he&#xD;
should recommeDd daily short ones 2 on horseback,&#xD;
both 'for Miss Yarassa and Miss Blanche.&#xD;
Blanche had always been in the habit of riding a&#xD;
f~reat deal, but siwce the death of her mother she had&#xD;
entirely djscontiriu this favorite exercise. It was&#xD;
associated in her ~ind with all pleasant memories&#xD;
and exhilerating e~notion, and seen~ed inappropriate&#xD;
to her present depressed state2' of spirits. Once or&#xD;
twic~ F~a~nk had suggested a ride, thinking it might&#xD;
b~ing' back th~ rose to her cheek; but sI~ evidently&#xD;
shrank so at the proposal, that he' did not insist. She&#xD;
agreed to it when urged b~ the doctor, entirely on&#xD;
Ximena' s accQunt, afid with some persuasion induced&#xD;
the latter to consent likewise.&#xD;
2 Prank would have ordered the horse~ for that same&#xD;
afternoon.~.4jut Blanche informed him~that lie was too&#xD;
precipitate in his expectations. Neither X~mena or'&#xD;
herself posses 3ed that very necessary equipment, a&#xD;

She went to i imena's room to consult h~r as to&#xD;
the mod 3 and material of dresses.&#xD;
'Ju~t let Juanita get'me, one of~ your dresses that&#xD;

to th.e table n"ear' Ximena~&#xD;
'I .i~eally do~ 'riot know,' answered the latter. "Cloth&#xD;
is too heavy for ~urnmer-~and bombazin~ too light&#xD;
for a habit.' She looked sad, as she alwa~ did when&#xD;
any. allusion was made to her dress.&#xD;
'Yes, bombazin~e is entirely' too light. And be~&#xD;
sides anything worsted, even berege, is unendurThly&#xD;
warm-to me, that is. If we could get some lustr&amp;amp;&#xD;
less linen! I always prefer linenfor a surnmerriding&#xD;
habit. Supp6s'~ I 'tell her to 'get linen if she can?&#xD;
Would you like it?'&#xD;
Ximena assented.&#xD;
'It can~be lined throughout with 't'he same, so that&#xD;
the skirt will h~xig .well.' I~ think it very likely Ma-&#xD;
dame IB- may have some herself. She imports her&#xD;

what h:'d she b~ttci~ take?'&#xD;
'Would it be safe to leave it to her own selection?'&#xD;

'Juanita,' said Ximena,~ as th~ woman entered, in&#xD;
answer to the bell,' 'get a dre$sh of mine that'fit's w'ill,&#xD;
and then -~~- I want some money..'&#xD;
''Never mind about the money now;' said 'Blanche&#xD;
smiling. "Wait until MadAme sends her "bill. Lus-&#xD;

'Ar~ you' comingikwn V sh6 said,"rising.-~ or shallI&#xD;

'What herse.c~n she 'ride, Fraiik,' inquired Blanche,&#xD;

'I am sorry ~QU think I have been deficient in pro-&#xD;

"Y~pu see,' exdahned Frank, intertuping him ,with&#xD;

The 'argument ~eemed unanswerabl'~-and. so Ed-&#xD;

their obstinate belief that he was in ~ovb with her-&#xD;

ecsta~ising.&#xD;
The riding habits made their appearance in due time,&#xD;
and on the afternoon Qf the sa~ne day the horses were&#xD;

added: 'You see Edward is always s~ 'silent and re-&#xD;

'You really expected it?'&#xD;
Â£ Certainly. I consider it beyond expression, pro.&#xD;

he should wait until the' season was. more adv~nc~d.&#xD;
Blanche was n~t disappointed in h~r expectation&#xD;
that K~te and Xixnena :would be p~rfeetly fascinated&#xD;
with each other.. Li~cy,~too, was delighted with the&#xD;
yoi~ng Spanish girl, and agreed heartily with her sis~&#xD;
ters in their wonder and injiignation at Edward7a ob~-&#xD;
tuse indifference to such rare charms.&#xD;
Their visit of three weeks was~drawing t6a~lose.&#xD;
It had passed very pleasantly, except, a~ Kat~ con-&#xD;
stantly complained, that they saw almost nothing of&#xD;
Frank, who s~en~ hi~ whole time at Everona, his own&#xD;
plantation, sometimes Dare-Devil, an~d soinetimes&#xD;
iLorimer, being his companion. He ex~iised himself&#xD;
by saying how very busy he~ was with some final&#xD;
work he was having done; but Kate thought he might&#xD;
have deferred it'until after they were gone.&#xD;
The night before they were to' sLart home, Lucy,&#xD;
after a lengthened feminine conference with Blanche&#xD;
and Kate, in the room of the former, retired to her own.&#xD;
chamber, to find Dare walking up and dow~j tb~e~ floor&#xD;
in a very disturbed manner. He turned to the door&#xD;
as she entered, and telling her, that he was going to&#xD;
take .a smoke with Pranl~, hurried aw~iy. He did me-&#xD;
ch~nical1y take 'his cigar~case froni his pocket, as he&#xD;
~walked quickly down the passage, and half open'~d&#xD;
it. But he put it back again whew he reached the&#xD;
door of Frank's room. There 'he paused, and stood.&#xD;
still for a little time, and his stout heax~t qu1ailed.; as,&#xD;
a few years later, it piailed ~not, when he led 1~is&#xD;
regiment of Louisiana boys through many a day ibf&#xD;
bloody battle, for it ~as a desperate cast he wa~ abo~t&#xD;

'I thought the time for that ceremony was past, or&#xD;
