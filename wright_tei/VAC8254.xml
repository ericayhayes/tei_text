CHAPTER L&#xD;
THE room had a lonely look. I left my seat by the 1:ttle&#xD;
dressing-table, where I had been for the last hour, within&#xD;
mA           face buried in my arms, the while dreary pictures had been&#xD;
drifting before me. Ii went to one of the dormer windows&#xD;
and looked out, hoping the outward view would tend to dis-&#xD;
pel my homesick anguish. How different were the small&#xD;
city yards upon which I gazed, from the green undulating&#xD;
meadows and orchards that surrounded the home that was&#xD;
now lost to me for ever. I had longed to see more of the&#xD;
world than grandmother's cottage life permitted; bright&#xD;
cheery scenes had ever shifted in the distance. That dis-&#xD;
tance was now reached, that wonderful world was now&#xD;
entered: the old experiences were all passed; the foiid, aged&#xD;
face of m~ best friend had passed from mortal Bight, and&#xD;
Was beaming youthfully among angels. I stood upon the&#xD;
threshold of existence, not with eager arms outstretched to&#xD;
the future, but shrinking back with sorrowful timidity,&#xD;
endeavoring to clasp the sweetnesses of retreating childhood.&#xD;
"Standing with reluctant feet,&#xD;
Where the brook and river meet,&#xD;
Womanhood and childhood fleet!"&#xD;

&#xD;
,REMINIsCENCEs. ,.&#xD;
&#xD;
I looked down upon the tiny spot of earth belonging to the&#xD;
house ; two flourishing trees grew there, .and a grape-vilec&#xD;
clung to a latticbd trellis; a solitary bird perched itself upon&#xD;
a swaying stem of the vine, too timorous.-to sing so far from&#xD;
home. Flower-beds were ranged on each side of the yard&#xD;
by the fence, but the plants looked weak and drooping for&#xD;
want of sufficient sunshine,-a portion of the original grass-&#xD;
plot was partitioned off with a row of box, and devoted to&#xD;
Flora; under the more lavish sunlight, the flowers planted&#xD;
here threw a cheerful glow over the whole yard by their gay&#xD;
and graceful presence. A dull quiet was in the house. In&#xD;
my~ distant upper room .I could hear no voices, no busy&#xD;
steps, no sounds of family life.   -    -&#xD;
For the first time since I had' entered it, I looked ob-&#xD;
servantly around the chamber which had been assigned to&#xD;
me; it was a large, old-fashioned room: evidently it had&#xD;
been occupied by some one, for a dozen books and a small&#xD;
rosewood box on the table seemed in familiar use, from their&#xD;
halfworn appearance : within the books were fugitive bits&#xD;
of 'paper, with sweet poems printed thereon. Upon the fly--&#xD;
leaf' of several 'of the books the name of" "Grace Percival"&#xD;
was' delicately traced: once, when a child, my cousin Grace&#xD;
had spent a few days at our cottage; then she was lovely and&#xD;
kind, but as she was three years my senior, I had not 'felt&#xD;
quite at home with her. She had lived in' this house with&#xD;
her sister ever since the latter's marriage,: I wondered where&#xD;
she was now: Cousin Mary had not mentioned her to me,:&#xD;
while we talked below stairs.&#xD;
I had been under the roof little more than =an hour, and&#xD;
yet it -seemed very long since I had looked with trembling&#xD;
heart from the carriage-window, as the vehicle stopped before&#xD;
the staid red brick-house; apparently no one heard it rumble&#xD;
over the stones, and then stop, for no cordial face hastened to&#xD;
the door : I paused a moment before lifting the brass knocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY GRANDMoTHER.&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
A smiling black girl opened the door for me, and ushered&#xD;
me into the parlor : as she-returned towards ,the kitchen, I&#xD;
heard a small ebony boy, who had been peeping from -the&#xD;
head of the stairs, whisper, " Is that her ?"&#xD;
I was left alone a few moments to await the entrance of&#xD;
Cousin Mary Rodman, of whom I had little knowledge. I&#xD;
looked about the old-fashioned parlor to see if I could glean&#xD;
any idea of 'her habits. There were -no graceful trifles;&#xD;
every thing -was exceedingly neat; the mahogany table with&#xD;
slender legs stood below the~ gilt-framed looking-glass, and&#xD;
held a large Family Bible,-with a few late works by choice&#xD;
authors : in one corner was a polished mahogany stand, with&#xD;
its top standing up in a perpendicular position, like a shield ;&#xD;
finely carved chairs and sofa, and an ancient piano completed'&#xD;
the furniture.&#xD;
-At length Cousin Mary came in with both hands out-&#xD;
stretched, and with a kind smile on her countenance. She&#xD;
kissed me ; she did Rot know that her welcome went like&#xD;
sunshine into my fearful heart.&#xD;
" And this is .our Cousin Kate !" she said ; ".I am so&#xD;
glad that you accepted my invitation to piake this your&#xD;
home."&#xD;
-" I should have been utterly homeless without your invi-&#xD;
tation!" I answered, striving to keep back the tears, and the&#xD;
rising of my heart. -My grandmother was a great-aunt of&#xD;
Mrs. IRodman's by marriage only; our families .had never&#xD;
been intimate since my grandfather's death, many years pre-&#xD;
vious  I had been left an orphan in infancy. When Cousin&#xD;
Marjr heard, to her great surprise, that grandmother had lost&#xD;
the little property she possessed, and that the blow had&#xD;
snapt the thread of her feeble existence, she had written to&#xD;
me immediately, begging me in most cordial terms to come&#xD;
to her home.&#xD;
.When Mrs. Rodman ceased speaking, I saw that the&#xD;

SUNDAY SCHOOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
COUSIN KATR HAMILTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
warmth and brightness of her face had all vanished with her&#xD;
brilliant smile: the face which IL remembered was rosy, ani-&#xD;
mated, and joyous; the face before me was a repressed one,&#xD;
almost severe in its calmness; her clear black eyes, firm&#xD;
~mouth, a straight'black ~hair, plainly parted on her brow,&#xD;
tinged my ardent gratitude suddenly with a respectful awe-&#xD;
with a fear lest IL should never be able to reach her standard&#xD;
of duty. IL knew not then that she was severe with herself&#xD;
and merciful to others.&#xD;
Cousin," she 'said, after a few moments' consideration,&#xD;
"shall IL take 'you to your room? IL am teaching Sally to&#xD;
make a fruit-cake, and it remains in statu quo while' I am&#xD;
here. Perhaps you would like to re~t after your journey.&#xD;
We shall not have tea until seven o'clock."&#xD;
"IL followed her up stairs. When with a cheerful word&#xD;
she closed the door of my room behind her, and went away,&#xD;
a thousand feelings rushed over me: IL felt more lonely than&#xD;
when IL had stood above a late new-made grave. It was so&#xD;
desolate to see following me no longer the indulgent eyes which&#xD;
had from babyhood beamed on me with the pride of love.&#xD;
IL thought of the village church and the smiling goodbyeye"&#xD;
as IL sallied forth to Sunday-school on a summer morning,&#xD;
and looked back to see grandmother standing in the porch,&#xD;
with one hand shading her eyes. It seemed to me, as I&#xD;
stood in the centre of the room, with clasped hands and&#xD;
slowly coming tears, that IL had lost that which the whole&#xD;
world, and all the glory of it, could never buy me-mctternal&#xD;
love. ILn my little cottage home all my thoughts had been&#xD;
responded to with' interest, :all my fancies and wishes had&#xD;
been fondly consulted: henceforth it would not be so&#xD;
My trunk bad been sent up to my room. IL essayed to~&#xD;
unpack it, but desisted with a miserable pang; it was break-&#xD;
ing the last tie that bound me to the returning past. IL&#xD;
returned again to the window: dark clouds bad overcast the&#xD;
&#xD;
heavens, shutting away the sunshine; anon a silver light rose&#xD;
from about the horizon, and slowly glided up the sky, but&#xD;
soon the black clouds of the zenith spread themselves abroad&#xD;
to absorb it, and a gray dismal shroud came down close upon&#xD;
the houses, drearily shading all things. Then the rain de-&#xD;
scended in fitful dashes.&#xD;
IL heard a step upon the ~tairs, and strove to assume a&#xD;
cheerful look. Cousin Mary came into my room, saying,&#xD;
"Would you like 'to come down stairs now, cousin? it seems&#xD;
so dark and dreary. I fear you will get homesick."&#xD;
She must have seen, that I had been weeping, but she&#xD;
made no comment upon it. IL followed her silently. When.&#xD;
we were seated in the parlor, she handed me a book, asking,&#xD;
"Are you fond of reading, dear?"&#xD;
"IL am very fond of it," IL returned, glad of the excuse&#xD;
to turxi over the pages, and tear my thoughts from myself.&#xD;
"Do you like to rdad aloud, Kate?~' she inquired, after,&#xD;
IL had looked over the book.&#xD;
am not in the habit of it;" IL responded, "and like&#xD;
most young girls, IL read too fast."&#xD;
"Will you read to me while IL sew?"&#xD;
IL complied: ere an hour had gone by, we had paused to&#xD;
enter into a cordial discussion. Ihad never had an oppor-&#xD;
tunity to mingle' with cultivated persons, and Mrs. iRodman's&#xD;
interest in books charmed me. At home, grandmother had&#xD;
considered reading a wasteful occupation; therefore IL h~d&#xD;
concealed much of my reading from her.&#xD;
While' we were talking, three gentlemen passed the win-&#xD;
dow, and ascended the front porch. A timorous feeling took&#xD;
possession of me instantly. I recognized~ Mr. Rodman from&#xD;
his commanding height and general aspect. As he entered'&#xD;
the room, he glanced at me, then inquiringly looked at his&#xD;
wife. She introduced me as "Cousin Kate Hamilton." He&#xD;
bowed politely but coldly, and did not offer to shake hands:&#xD;

&#xD;
he merely asked if I had had an agreeable journey. He was&#xD;
a very handsome man, but he seemed puritanical and severe.&#xD;
His introduction was followed by that of two young men:&#xD;
they were clerks in his store. One of them, a Mr. Bedell,&#xD;
was embarrassed in the extreme: he was bashfulness per-&#xD;
sonified: he was of an ungainly figure, with yellow hair and&#xD;
an enormous mouth; but when he had recovered from the&#xD;
effects of meeting a stranger, his blue eyes were full of energy&#xD;
and intelligence. The other young man, Mr. Gray, had a&#xD;
most attractive countenance, and brilliant observing eyes; a&#xD;
genial light played over his face when he smiled.&#xD;
We immediately went to the dining-room to take tea. A&#xD;
constrained silence prevailed at the table~; I sat in mortal&#xD;
terror lest IL should drop my knife or upset my tea, for I had&#xD;
a perception that such faults would not be lightly regarded&#xD;
by Mr. Rodman.&#xD;
Mr. Bedell at length passed the cake; as he did so, his&#xD;
elbow touched his teaspoon, aild it flew un the fluor; he set&#xD;
down the plate of cake, and stooped to, pick it up, but his&#xD;
chin struck on the edge of a fresh .cup of tea, without over-&#xD;
turning it, however. He recovered his equilibrium with a&#xD;
flaming countenance, evidently unhappy at the recollection&#xD;
of his performance. Mx. Gray in vain etideavored to restrain&#xD;
his mirth; he left the ~able abruptly, seized his hat, and&#xD;
went out. The moment the door closed behind him we&#xD;
heard an explosion of lau~hter. Mr. Bedell's excessive 'grav-&#xD;
ity was too much for me. I strove to sip my tea,-J even&#xD;
pinched myself, but it would not do. I gave way, and&#xD;
laughed with my whole heart a moment, then solemnly ad-&#xD;
dressed myself to~ my tea again. Cousin, Mary smiled, Mr.&#xD;
Rodman looked stern, and Mr. Bedell took his leave. After&#xD;
he had gone, Cousin John Rodman said, addressing his&#xD;
wife,-&#xD;
"I am surprised that Walter should have been so rude&#xD;
&#xD;
(I&#xD;
&#xD;
as to have quitted the room. II cannot see that James's awk-&#xD;
wardness offered any occasion for merriment."&#xD;
"I can readily excuse any one for laughing at the ~cene,"&#xD;
replied Cousin Mary, speaking with embarrassment, yet with&#xD;
a flash in her black eye, for his remark reflected upon me.&#xD;
11cr husband regarded her with a cold, sharp glance;&#xD;
it revealed his lack of conjugal tenderness; Mrs. Rodman&#xD;
deemed conscious of the look, although she drooped her eyes&#xD;
upon her plate. 11cr lips were very slightly pressed to-&#xD;
gether, as if to keep them from quivering, and then the flush&#xD;
died away from her face, and her closed mouth softened in&#xD;
its expression, and settled into serenity. II felt how beau-&#xD;
tiful was the holiness in her soul, which could so soon dispel&#xD;
an impulse of passion.&#xD;
"Grace and the children will return from the country&#xD;
next week," she said, looking at me. " They will make the&#xD;
house quite gay."&#xD;
Here we arose from the table. Cousin John-~went to a&#xD;
stand, and looked among a quantity of papers with a dissat-&#xD;
isfied look. "My morning's paper out of the way, as usual,"&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
" Oh, excuse me, John, here it is ! ".replied his wife,&#xD;
taking it from her work-basket. '~'J meant to have laid it&#xD;
back on the stalAd, and forgot it."&#xD;
"Yes, you're pretty good ~t forgetting."&#xD;
Again the pained flush returned to poor Cousiu Mary's&#xD;
cheek. I felt that his words must cut with a keener edge&#xD;
in the presence of a stranger, and was about returning to&#xD;
my lonely room, when Cousin Mary said, "Won't you spend&#xD;
the evening down here, Kate?"&#xD;
IL went back, and sat down in the corner by her, mechan-&#xD;
ically taking up her work, and beginning to sew. Mr. Rod-&#xD;
man left, which made me feel a little less constrained, yet&#xD;
did not remove the miserable feeling occasioned by discov-&#xD;

&#xD;
COUSIN MARY'S WEDDING.&#xD;
&#xD;
ering that fate had cast me into a loveless home. Proba-&#xD;
bly Cousin Mary had commenced life with overflowing hopes.&#xD;
I remembered well how she looked when standing at the&#xD;
altar beside her handsome husband. It was the first wed-&#xD;
ding I had ever attended, and being impressed with an jdea&#xD;
that it was something very astonishing, mysterious and hap-&#xD;
py, I continually directed my eyes to the bride and groom.&#xD;
Her young face was lighted up with a rosy joy, which I&#xD;
shall never forget, young as I was at the time. And the&#xD;
same joy beamed in the face of the husband, which turned,&#xD;
and turned again to drink happiness and assurance from the&#xD;
blushing countenance of the bride. Why had all that love&#xD;
and joy faded? Was it in itself ephemeral; would it not&#xD;
stay~ with any of earth's children? or was there some defect&#xD;
in human hearts, which made them unable1 to hold affection&#xD;
in its warmest strength and purity? Why was it that when&#xD;
means of happiness were in reach of these two, they did not&#xD;
possess it? God once gave them a fresh gift in their love&#xD;
for each other! Whose fault was it that it had turned to&#xD;
anguish? Who was guilty? One, or both. My heart an-&#xD;
swered that Cousin Mary was least guilty, and that her in-&#xD;
nocence did not prevent he~r from being the most acute suf-&#xD;
ferer. I sti~ove to shake off the many thoughts that pressed&#xD;
upon me in ~onsequence of my new life. I tried to talk; so&#xD;
~did Mrs. iRodman; but we w.~re inakipg a sad failure of it,&#xD;
when two visitors were announced. Their very faces s~eined&#xD;
to brighten The atmosphere of the room; they looked ~o&#xD;
.gotd and cordial. Cousin Mary rose quickly, and with her&#xD;
resplendent smile, gave both hands to one of the guests, the&#xD;
lady, saying, "I am so glad to see you-both of you!"&#xD;
and she extended one hand to the gentleman, with a frank,&#xD;
cheerful expression, that quite transformed her.&#xD;
"Here is my new cousin, you see!" she said, turning to&#xD;
me, and introducing me to Miss Cardover and her brother.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FLOWERS OF LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
'15&#xD;
&#xD;
The lady was apparently some years older than her compan-&#xD;
ion, but her countenance was charming from its good sense,&#xD;
benevolence, and an expression not to be described; to look&#xD;
upon her was to feel that her inner life was strong, fresh and&#xD;
triumphant. We do not much think of this peculiarity on&#xD;
meeting others, unless we feel weak ourselves; then it sweeps&#xD;
into our consciousness and gives us courage. Mr. Cardover,&#xD;
who ~eemed a young man about twenty-seven, also had some-&#xD;
thing of the same look, but in a less degree. He was not&#xD;
as handsome as his sister had been, but his dark gray eyes,&#xD;
and manly, assured voice, gave evidence that the outer tem-&#xD;
plc would become of little consequence when the spirit was&#xD;
known.&#xD;
Conversation became animated and agreeable. Co~isin&#xD;
Mary seemed to have emerged from the quiet, self-res~ra~ned&#xD;

a book she had lately been reading, "Hyperion," and asked&#xD;
with glowing cheeks and earnest accent, "Is not that song&#xD;
of Lelis beautiful? IL~o y&amp;amp;u remember these words&#xD;
'Who in life's battle firm doth stand,&#xD;
Shall bear Hope's tender blossoms&#xD;
Into the silent land.' "&#xD;
"I do remember them!" returned Miss Cardover.&#xD;
"That single verse is a flower that perfumes my very life.&#xD;
How many such flowers we find as we travel on! They&#xD;
seem to spring up where we most desire them. I really&#xD;
think the older II grow," she continued, laughing, "that it is&#xD;
almost a satisfaction to get into trouble, for the sake of being&#xD;
helped out by some blessed words that shine into the heart,&#xD;
and light it up as it never was lighted before.&#xD;
"Well! we'll endeavor to get you into trouble," said her&#xD;
brother, with a laughing glance. "When there is sunshine&#xD;

remembrance, and when i~rials come, there never was any&#xD;
thing that could have happened so exquisitely adapted to&#xD;
do us good. So Mrs. I{odman, we are fairly outwitting the&#xD;
fates at our house."&#xD;
"She has taught me ~ little of her philosophy," said&#xD;
Uousin Mary, with a grateful look at Miss Cardover. "But&#xD;
my nature often sets up a warfare against it'; perhaps I shall&#xD;
come out right in the end." The smile with which this was&#xD;
said, was full of feeling. At this moment Cousin John, Mr.&#xD;
BedeIl, and Walter Gray came in. The conversation took&#xD;
a totally different tone. Mrs. Rodman, although gentle and&#xD;
kind in manner,~seemed to withdraw within herself. She&#xD;
had blossomed out, as it were, under the sunshine of cordial&#xD;
eyes and true hearts. She had been earnest and free, her&#xD;
face bright with expression. Now the glow rested on her&#xD;
cheek, but ~he simply strove to fill up pauses in the confer&#xD;
nation. M~. Rodman threw off the ung9nial manner which&#xD;
had distingnish~d him at the tea-table. His remarks be-&#xD;
trayed a mind enriched with information. IL wondered if&#xD;
his mental riches were always reserved for those who would&#xD;
prize them less than' his family; and if his smiles aud kind-&#xD;
ness were always withheld from those only to whom they&#xD;
were life and air. IL was attracted from observing him, by&#xD;
hearing Mr. Cardover say to Walter Gray,&#xD;
"Nonsense! A young man of your age should overcome&#xD;
destiny, instead of railing at it. Your success in lift~ de-&#xD;
pends solely upon one quality.&#xD;
"What is that?" demanded Walter, with flashing eyes.&#xD;
'' Perseverance.~~&#xD;
Walter's lip curled bitterly as he said, "Will persever&#xD;
ance compensate me for the loss of a musical education?&#xD;
Will it earn the bread IL eatunless IL employ my tin~e at a&#xD;
business IL hate, and am not fitted for?" Here Mr. Rod-&#xD;
man turned his head and looked at ~Walter, as a monarch&#xD;
&#xD;
might glance at a slave who expressed an opinion. Walter,&#xD;
however, went on. "If my father had not died a bankrupt&#xD;
three years ago, my whole future life would have run in a&#xD;
different channel."&#xD;
"True!" returned Mr. Cardover, "but in that exigency&#xD;
it relieved your father's heart to find the hand of hi~ old&#xD;
friend stretched out to you."&#xD;
"Ye's," said the young man, in a gentler voice; "IL do&#xD;
not forget that Mr. IRodman was my father's' faithful friend&#xD;
in his last sorrowful days. Still nature has intimated what&#xD;
my vocation should be, and I cannot be satisfied as I am."&#xD;
"If you ever take an honorable place among men, it&#xD;
will be owing in a great measure to your father's dying at&#xD;
the exact period he did!"&#xD;
"How so?"&#xD;
"ILIad he lived, and continued prosperous, you would not&#xD;
have settled upon any one pursuit. You would have had&#xD;
means of gratifying every wandering inspiration, and would&#xD;
consequently have been an idler in the busy world, finding&#xD;
none of. the gems which hard experience turns overto the&#xD;
seeker. More than many others, you need the balance-&#xD;
wheel of labor. We are indebted to toiling spirits for all&#xD;
that is great and glorious in the world."&#xD;
"I would toil in my art," answered Walter, sadly. "IL&#xD;
am not a willing laborer now. My lot and IL are at dis-&#xD;
cord."&#xD;
"And must remain so until you acquire faith to believe&#xD;
the eternal God also has a plan of your life more gteat and&#xD;
harmonious than your own. You have power to thwart it&#xD;
or to coincide with it. ILnstead of refining, why not alter&#xD;
your situation, or seek means to do so? Why blame your&#xD;
lot, instead of, recognizing it as a foundation for something&#xD;
brighter and higher?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Row can I be a musician?" asked Walter, with&#xD;
slight impatience in his tone.&#xD;
"You can begin by doing little at first. What time&#xD;
you go to the store in the morning?"&#xD;
"Aboi~t eight o'clock."&#xD;
~" Then if you rise at half..past four, you will have three&#xD;
hours to devote to music every morning, 'besides many even-&#xD;
ings. I think I can get permission for you to play on that&#xD;
fine old organ in the church you can obtain the organist as&#xD;
teacher. "&#xD;
A smile flashed over Walter's face. "I never thought&#xD;
of that," he said, grasping Mr. Car4over's hand. "Thanks!"&#xD;
"I suppose it will belong to me to convey him from the&#xD;
organ to the store at the proper hour," said Mr. Bedell.&#xD;
Walter laughed, and obeying the impulse that seized&#xD;
him, took his flute, and went out on the rear piazza, in the&#xD;
summer moonshine. In a moment a' sweet, triumphant&#xD;
strain floated in.&#xD;
"You are satisfied with destiny, James?" inquired Mr.&#xD;
Cardover.&#xD;
"No, sir," answered Mr. Bedell, with a 'smile, and quiet&#xD;
decision of manner. "I am tolerably content at present,&#xD;
for I expect to go over low steps before I reach my object.&#xD;
I must labor slowly, and contend against the world in a dif-&#xD;
ferent manner from Walter. There is a charm in every&#xD;
thing he says and does, which makes him friends instantly.&#xD;
It is a pleasure to forward one like him; it is natural that&#xD;
men should wish him success. I think I have learned ex-&#xD;
actly where I stand, and I think I shall conquerr notwith-&#xD;
standing."&#xD;
Miss Cardover looked at James with shining eyes, in&#xD;
which there beamed almost maternal pride. Mr. Cardover&#xD;
said, "Walter's personal advantages will be of no real bene-&#xD;
fit to him; he will rely too much upon them; they will&#xD;
&#xD;
'make him more self-indulgent than he would otherwise&#xD;
be."&#xD;
"Are we not staying late, Pliny?" asked Miss Cardo-&#xD;
ver.&#xD;
Her brother rose. "Are they all well at home, aunt?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Bedell with familiar interest.&#xD;
"Quite well! "returned Miss Cardover. "Never neglect&#xD;
your regular visits, James, for father and mother expect you&#xD;
always. I think old people ought never to be disappointed,"&#xD;
she added, smiling, as she turned to bid Mrs. Rodman "good&#xD;
evening." After they had go~e, Cousin John's soul trans-&#xD;
migrated into its former s eli&#xD;
"A light ?" he said, looking on the mantel-piece, al-&#xD;
though they were all burning on his wife's work-stand.&#xD;
"Here, John! " she answered cheerfully, handing him&#xD;
one. He left us without a "good night." It struck a&#xD;
pang into my heart; it assured me that Mr. Rodman did&#xD;
not think me worthy the courtesy due a guest; I was sim-&#xD;
ply a burden thrown upon him for support.' He had joined&#xD;
his wife' in inviting me to live with them,~ because he could&#xD;
not very well avoid it, rather than from liberal motives. 'A&#xD;
sickening despair was settling around my heart, through&#xD;
which surged the angry tide of resentment and bitter pride.&#xD;
"What to do?" I was asking mentally, as I took a lamp.&#xD;
to retire. I believe Cousin Mary half divined my thoughts,&#xD;
for when I looked at her, her~ dark eyes were bent upon me&#xD;
very sorrowfully. She put her arm around my waist, and&#xD;
kissing my cheek said,-..&#xD;
~' You will look upon me as your sincere friend, will you&#xD;
not? Look upon me as a mother, or elder sister."&#xD;
I thanked her, and returned her kiss, hastily leaving the&#xD;
room lest a tear should betray the feelings Contending within&#xD;
me. "What to do ?" was the aching thought with which&#xD;
I fell asleep at last.&#xD;

LILY'S TROUBLE.               21&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IT.&#xD;
WHEN Sunday came, we went to church, and sat in a great&#xD;
pew, which we nearly filled. It was an old-fashioned church,&#xD;
not destitute of a solemn grandeur and quiet that charmed&#xD;
the saul. As Cousin Mary bowed her head in worship, it&#xD;
seemed akin to the solemn verities of her life. Cousin John&#xD;
also bowed his head on first taking his seat, but he did it&#xD;
hurriedly, and looked around at every new-coiner with a&#xD;
careless interest immediately on raising it. A little party&#xD;
came in that absorbed my attention from devotional thoughts&#xD;
also. It was an aged pair, followed by a younger lady and&#xD;
gentleman. The latter seated the three, and then stood a&#xD;
moment speaking with the lady who walked up the aisle with&#xD;
him. He had a thoughtful face, beaming with a kind of&#xD;
heavenly light; his mouth was very beautiful, and his brow&#xD;
and head had a shapely beauty that denoted a superior in-&#xD;
tellect. Many eyes turned to him with interest. He as-&#xD;
cended the pulpit steps, a~nd with joy I recognized him as&#xD;
the preacher. MI hen the sermon began, the eyes of the mul-&#xD;
titude did not remove fro4 his face, and thirsty ears drank&#xD;
in his thougl~ts, filled with life and strength, and clothed&#xD;
with chaste elegance.&#xD;
"What do you think of our minister, Mr. Waldron,&#xD;
Kate?" asked Cousin Mary, as we emerged from the&#xD;
church.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was delighted with him." The Cardovers here ap-&#xD;
proached us~ and cordial greetings passed. My eyes fell&#xD;
upon an enchanting child who clung to Miss Cardover's hand.&#xD;
H~r eyes, full of luminous softness, turned to Walter, who&#xD;
walked beside me; he motioned to her, and she skipped to his&#xD;
side with a joyous laugh.&#xD;
"Lily, what have you been ~doing lately?" be asked,&#xD;
taking her little hand in his.&#xD;
"0, every thing but what I ought to do, Mr. WaIter.&#xD;
J3ut I'm going to be real good when I begin school again.&#xD;
Do you believe some of the girls say Aunt Cardover isn't my&#xD;
real aunt, and she only took me to live with her because I&#xD;
was so!orlorn nobody would have any thing to do with me.&#xD;
I don't care! I'm as good as they are. Would you care,&#xD;
Mr. Walter?"&#xD;
"0, no! Study your lessons and cultivate your mind,&#xD;
Lily! That is all you must think about."&#xD;
"I must cultivate my heart," said the child naively.&#xD;
"It's very hard work." She heaved a little sigh, probably&#xD;
in remembrance of some misdemeanor; then~ with a joyous&#xD;
light in her large eyes, she tripped away with Miss Cardo-&#xD;
ver, saying, "Good-bye! good-bye!"&#xD;
"You think Grace and the two children will certainly&#xD;
come to-morrow? ", I said to Cousin iMary, as the lovely Lily&#xD;
disappeared.&#xD;
"Yes, certainly. You will like Grace, Kate," sho an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
"I think I shall, from the letter you read me from&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"She is such a darling in my eyes," pursued Cousin&#xD;
Mary, "I cannot understand how others can see her in a&#xD;
different light from what Ii do. You must remember that&#xD;
my representation of her is dictated by partial affection.&#xD;
Don't expect too much."&#xD;

22               THE ADOPTI~D CHILD.                                                   NATURE'S NOBLEMAN.              23&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very well put in," remarked Mr. iRodman, who walked&#xD;
a little ahead. We l~ad not supposed he had heard us.&#xD;
"Grace is well enough."&#xD;
It was an exceedingly warm day; after dinner ]I took a&#xD;
book and sought the back piazza, which was in shade, aiid&#xD;
partially empowered by heavy vines. Walter came out, and&#xD;
began to play very softly on his flute. Mr. Bedell followed&#xD;
with a book.&#xD;
"Lily is your aunt's adopted child?" II said, still think-&#xD;
ing of her beauteous looks.&#xD;
"She bears the sanw relation to Miss Cardover that I&#xD;
do," answered Mr. Bedell. "I was without parents or&#xD;
home when Miss Cardover adopted me. One day; ten years&#xD;
ago, I had an immense basket of chips on my head. I earned&#xD;
a little money by selling them; a German boy knocked over&#xD;
my burden, and ran on laughing. I stooped to pick up my&#xD;
load as Miss Cardover came along.&#xD;
"'Who is that cruel boy, my poor child?' asked the&#xD;
strange lady coming to my side.&#xD;
"'Don't know!' said I, without looking up, for there&#xD;
was a hardened pride in me that rebelled at pity.&#xD;
'~' I'll help you!' she said, as she assisted me. 'Where&#xD;
do you live?'&#xD;
"'In the next street!'&#xD;
"'And I live in that house yonder, a1~the very end of the&#xD;
street. Do you see it? It is light yellow. I should&#xD;
like to have you come to-morrow and see me. Will you&#xD;
come? '~&#xD;
"'What time shall I come?'&#xD;
"'Early in tho morning.&#xD;
"I went, and Mi~s Carddver learned all my story. She&#xD;
adopted me that very day ;-she gave me a sound English&#xD;
education and honest principles. She~ taught me .that all&#xD;
men were equal in the sight of God, and that' I demeaned&#xD;
&#xD;
myself when I was ashamed of my beggary-..it was an acci-&#xD;
dent, as well as the possession of riches. III think I am not&#xD;
very ambitious ;-I know I am not a brilliant fellow, but if&#xD;
working and plodding will send me up on th&amp;amp; ladder among&#xD;
men who are honored, II shall go up, and show Miss Cardo.&#xD;
ver what she has made of me. Ii never expect to repay her&#xD;
for what she has done for me. Ii couldn't do it! But it&#xD;
will please her to see me do well in the world. Whenever I&#xD;
am tempted to fall into the vices common among young&#xD;
men, Ii think of her, and say to myself; 'Ingratitude I No,&#xD;
James Bedell, you shall never be guilty of that'!' "&#xD;
"Did Mr. Cardover live in the family with you?" I&#xD;
'asked.&#xD;
"He did after the first three years. He ran away, and&#xD;
went to sea.-4he used to be a wild fellow; not bad, but so&#xD;
fond of adventure; he went to Egypt' with a gentleman, and&#xD;
raked among the ruins, there; he went to Rome, to Greece,&#xD;
to Turkey, even to Norway. He used to write such inter-&#xD;
esting letters home. Miss Cardover used to fear he never&#xD;
would come back, and settle down like other people. But&#xD;
the very day he was twenty-one he came back, and has been&#xD;
steady ever since. lie is what I call one of nature's noble-&#xD;
men. lie isn't very handsome, but he never speaks without&#xD;
being listened to."&#xD;
Walter suddenly stopped in the midst of an air he, was&#xD;
playing! We both looked at him; he colored slightly, and&#xD;
went on.&#xD;
"Who is that beautiful girl?" I asked, looking into the&#xD;
next yard, where a white-robed maiden was walking among&#xD;
the flower-beds.&#xD;
"That is Judith Morton. Grace is acquainted with her."&#xD;
"How superbly l~eautiful she is! How graceful and&#xD;
stately! What sort of a young lads is she?"&#xD;
"I don't know I am sure," said James. "Walter, you&#xD;

went in there one evening with Grace, not long ago. Tell&#xD;
us if she is equal to Grace. She isn't half as handsome."&#xD;
"Not half as handsome!" repeated Walter. "Why,&#xD;
Bedell, you are no judge of beauty at all. Grace has a&#xD;
frank, interesting face,-she pleases irresistibly. But there&#xD;
is no comparison between her and Miss Morton for beauty."&#xD;
Here the object of our remarks looked up, and bowed to&#xD;
Walter with a most hesitatingly coquettish air.&#xD;
~' You, look very cosy there," she said. "I hope you&#xD;
are only talking of psalnis and hymns, as it is Sunday."&#xD;
~" If it were not Sunday, we should hope to spirit you&#xD;
into our midst," answered Walter.&#xD;
"I do penance for my sins on Sunday!" she laughed.&#xD;
"I have the blues regularly. There !" and she flung a&#xD;
bouquet into our midst. "Fancy my unhappy spirit is ex-&#xD;
haling those odors I ." She tripped lightly up the steps,&#xD;
and went into the house. Walter looked as if he had, seen a&#xD;
vision; but he did not say any thing. Cousin John came to&#xD;
the back door ~ his great dark shadow fell on us.&#xD;
"I think," said he, "you would be much better employed&#xD;
in reading your Bibles. Walter, T must request yoti not to&#xD;
play on that instrument on the Sabbath."&#xD;
"II do not wish to desecrate the Sabbath," returned Wal-&#xD;
ter, "but I think there is less harm in enjoying music th~in&#xD;
yielding to idle thoughts."&#xD;
"You need not yield to idle thoughts, while there are&#xD;
edifying hooks in the house~"&#xD;
"I have been reading in the Bible," said Mr. Gray.&#xD;
Cousin John went in the house. "Old hypocrite!" said&#xD;
Walter, "it i~ his very affectation of a religion he does not&#xD;
possess, that makes us hate it."&#xD;
"Sto~p, there!" said James, "we do not hate true re-&#xD;
ligion. (We do not value a sound bill less because counter-&#xD;
feits are i~sucd."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
GRACE and the children had ~arrived. They came in the&#xD;
afternoon while we were at tea. Josephine bounded into&#xD;
the room first, her curls flying; her arms outspread. She&#xD;
sprang into her mother's lap, and devoured her with kisses,&#xD;
saying every other instant, "We're got here; ain't you&#xD;
glad!" Then she embraced her father, Mr. Bedell and&#xD;
Walter, in the same fashion. She kissed me bash fully.&#xD;
Grace and Gertrude came in together: the former was about&#xD;
twenty; her countenance was brilliant with the warmest&#xD;
affection. When she clasped Cousin Mary to her heart and&#xD;
kissed her, I felt how thoroughly they loved each other; and&#xD;
my own heart bounded towards that happy creature with&#xD;
instant love and hope. After the greetings were over, and&#xD;
the bustle of preparing a fresh tea-table, to which we sat&#xD;
down, past, I looked ~ong at Grace while she talked and&#xD;
laughed; and every n1 oment I looked, I loved her better.&#xD;
She was not beautiful strictly, but there was heart in every&#xD;
thing she said and did,-.--every movement was so natural,&#xD;
every word and look so spontaneous, so cordial. Her large&#xD;
eyes were of a dark gray; they looked black sometimes when&#xD;
they flashed with laughter, and again they had a dreamy,&#xD;
dovelike look, which does not often belong to a black eye.&#xD;
Her rich brown hair was worn in the madonna style; an&#xD;
empress might have envied those beautiful, abundant braids:&#xD;
her con~plexion was neither light nor dark, and her nose was&#xD;

&#xD;
inc~derately well shaped; her full lips would almost have&#xD;
had a voluptuous expression, if a proud dignity that tested&#xD;
upon them had not repelled the thought. Her form was&#xD;
completely perfect; even Judith MOrton had not so beau-&#xD;
tiful a carriage, so queenly a head. There was a sense of&#xD;
abounding life about Grace, a something in her very pres-&#xD;
ence that created cheerfulness. Gertrude IQoked like her&#xD;
mother; she was a methodical child, the reverse of Jose-&#xD;
phine. Cousin Grace went up stairs after tea, to unpack her&#xD;
trunk.: her sister followed to help her. Josephine slipped&#xD;
out of the front door, and went into Mr. Morton's, to see&#xD;
Frank Morton,.---Gertrude settled herself for a nap on the&#xD;
settee. She had not been there many moments, when her&#xD;
mother called to her to bring her the dust-brush. The young&#xD;
lady was evidently in the arms of Morpheus.&#xD;
"Why don't that child go?" said Walter. I rose to get&#xD;
th~ required article, but he touched my arm and wei~t to&#xD;
Gertrude; he looked down in her face until her eyelids&#xD;
win~ed,-still she did not move: he laid the point of his&#xD;
finder on her forehead in different places, and counted "one,&#xD;
two, three, four."&#xD;
"Stop!" cried Gertrude, covering her face with her&#xD;
hands. '~ What are you doing?"&#xD;
"I am counting the freckles!" responded Walter,&#xD;
mildly.&#xD;
"I wish you would' let me alone!" and she fled to the&#xD;
kitchen, looking very angry,-in a moment she 'was flying up&#xD;
stairs with' the dust.brush, and was not seen below stairs all&#xD;
the evening.&#xD;
"There is a 'rap at the front-door," said Walter, looking&#xD;
up from his book; "what a fine thing it must be, to be in&#xD;
love!"&#xD;
"What has love to do with that knock at the door? any&#xD;
thing&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes; a good deal, That sounds like Mr. Benzoni's&#xD;
knock. He is Grace's lover!"&#xD;
"Grace'~ lover! Is she engaged to be married?" I&#xD;
asked in dismay.&#xD;
"Certainly. ' Didn't you know it?"&#xD;
"No, indeed.! I supposed she and I could sympathize&#xD;
m that respect. She has come like a sunbeam into the&#xD;
house; and now, that Mr. iBenzoni must come and carry her&#xD;
off just as I shall find her necessary to my happiness!&#xD;
Well, are they tender and true, and all that sort of thing?&#xD;
Is he handsome, and fully worthy of Grace?"&#xD;
"He is very handsome! I know nothing of his dispo-&#xD;
sition; he is 'an Italian, and these foreigners manifest their&#xD;
feelings so differently from what we do. He seems to make&#xD;
a perfect goddess of his lady-love; and Grace's countenance&#xD;
shines, as Moses' did when he came down from the Mount,&#xD;
every time he comes. There! she is 'tripping down stairs.&#xD;
Do you see her smiling to herself?" She looked, as she ran&#xD;
down, into the dining-room where we sat; her large eyes&#xD;
seemed of a brilliant black; the fever flush of joy was upon&#xD;
her cheeks. How 'gloriously beautiful she was! how mere&#xD;
physical beauty paled before the splendor of soul that&#xD;
lighted up her face! Mr. Benzoni rushed out into the hall&#xD;
to meet her; Walter and II very unwillingly looked the other?&#xD;
way when they met. After they had gone 'into the parlor&#xD;
Walter said,-&#xD;
"Wouldn't you like to call on Miss Morton? You have&#xD;
exchanged flowers over the fence! Why not form a more&#xD;
intimate acquaintance? Josephine is in there; we can go&#xD;
after her.~~&#xD;
"I would a little rather not," I replied.&#xD;
"Why not?" he asked quickly.&#xD;
"I would rather Miss Morton should make the first ad-.&#xD;

"She has done so! you told me yesterday that she threw&#xD;

that pretty, ma belle?"&#xD;
"Yes! but still I do not know that she would desire to,&#xD;
number me among her visiting acquaintances'! You know&#xD;
he~ father is wealthy." I blushed as I said this, for it was&#xD;
hard for 'me to speak of my dependent situation; I had heard~&#xD;
Cousin Mary say that Mr. Morton valued friends mostly for&#xD;
the dollars and cents they owned. I felt sure he would not&#xD;
care about my being intimate with his daughter; and I knew&#xD;
that 'my antiquated dresses would seem out of place beside&#xD;
her graceful garments.&#xD;
"Won't you go?" asked Walter, looking at me very&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
"Oh! Jcah'tgo!"&#xD;
"Very well !" He took up his hat and went into the&#xD;
hall; at this moment the front door opened, and IL heard&#xD;
Miss Morton's voice, saying,-&#xD;
I have brought this child back, Mr. Gray; II don't ap-&#xD;
prove of her fascinating my brother! I won't have him&#xD;
coquetted with. Where is Miss Percival? I must con~rat-&#xD;
ulate her on her return?"&#xD;
Josephine had pushed open the parlor door,.-'.-.she was&#xD;
timidly shaking' hands with Mr. Benzoni. Grace came for-&#xD;
ward, and greeting Miss Morton cordially, urged us all to&#xD;
come in the parlor~ We went in. Mr. Benzoni riveted my&#xD;
attention, he was so brilliantly handsome; he had wild,&#xD;
splendid eyes; they betrayed a reckless, passionate heart,-&#xD;
his dark complexion set off his white teeth well: when he&#xD;
smiled, he made me think of a powerful bandit who never&#xD;
smiled except in triumph; as he passed his hand through the&#xD;
rich, clustering masses of his hair, aDd looked at me first,&#xD;
carelessly; then at Judith, with a long, observing gaze, there&#xD;
was something in his whole demeanor that indicated a 'will,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TWO BEAUTIES.               29&#xD;
&#xD;
reckless enough to override all obstacles, to reach a purpose&#xD;
he might have at heart. I looked at Judith! There was a&#xD;
strange interest in her awakened eyes,-she glanced away,&#xD;
then looked at him again, as though so~ne fascination led her&#xD;
to study him. Their beauty was not unlike; they had the&#xD;
same southern eyes, and. dark, waving, curling hair. I could&#xD;
ndt but acknowledge that Judith was more superbly beauti-&#xD;
ful than GraSe; every feature was so exquisitely perfect:&#xD;
her sudden stiles, the uplifting of her liquid eyes, every&#xD;
play of expression seemed to Captivate. She did not say a&#xD;
great deal, and what she did say was not remarkable in itself;&#xD;
yet there was a nameless fascination that kept one watching&#xD;
her,-there was a spell about her, an untold grace that in-&#xD;
vested her like an atmosphere; she seemed perfectly natural&#xD;
in her' conversation and movements; she had beenso accus-&#xD;
tomed to please, that she had not learned the constraint that&#xD;
often springs from the chill, which indifferent glances give.&#xD;
Grace looked at, her with heartfelt pleasure; she was glad to&#xD;
see her happy, when she felt that she had so much less to&#xD;
make her so, than herself. And yet, although I loved to&#xD;
watch Judith, and enjoyed her company heartily, I felt that&#xD;
T should choose Grace for a friend, and lean upon her heart&#xD;
with far more confidence. Walter and Judith talked to-&#xD;
gether, and their gay repartees drew forth sudden bursts of&#xD;
laughter from all of us. Josephine stood at the side of&#xD;
Grace, with her elbow leaning on her lap; she would clap&#xD;
her hands' at any thing funny, and bend down her curly head&#xD;
over them, laughing so heartily, Walter declared she never&#xD;
could be straightened up again, unless they restrained their&#xD;
wit.&#xD;
"The child's life must be saved, at any risk," said Ju-&#xD;
dith, " so I will go this instant!&#xD;
Mrs. Rodma ~ame to the parlor door and called Jo-&#xD;
sephine, to put her to bed. Walter went to Mr. Morton's&#xD;

porch with Judith, saying, it was particularly dangerous for&#xD;
young ladies to walk such a distance alone in the evening.&#xD;
III went to my chamber, ~iow to be shared by Grace: II was&#xD;
grateful that the house was to become cheerful witl~ her&#xD;
presence, and that darling little Josephine's: Gertrude IL did&#xD;
not think so much of. Hour after hour I lay awake, and&#xD;
pondered my prospects: every day, it seemed more intolera-&#xD;
ble that I shouki live on Cousin John's bounty. Grace was&#xD;
gdverncss to the children; if she were not, I was not fitted to&#xD;
instruct them, for IL only understood the English branches.&#xD;
True, I had sewed a good deal for Cousin Mary: she had&#xD;
taught me how to make Cousin John's shirts very neatly.&#xD;
I had more than earned my board, but it was evident Mr.&#xD;
iRodman thought the benefit conferred was all on his side.&#xD;
The bitterness of dependence was ground into my very soul.&#xD;
IL had thought of trying to earu iiiy living in some way, and&#xD;
boarding among strangers, that IL might be independent; but&#xD;
now the house seemed so homelike; IL was so irresistibly.&#xD;
attracted to Grace, and felt such a yearning love springing&#xD;
up in my heart for little Josephine. Cousin Mary was ex-&#xD;
ceedingly kind, and James and Walter seemed like brothers.&#xD;
I cried myself to sleep as I had done many nights before,.&#xD;
without being able to decide what I had best do. When IL&#xD;
awoke in the morning, Grace was dressed, and was reading&#xD;
some letters by the window.&#xD;
"Good morning!" said IL.&#xD;
"Oh! good morning!" she answered, coloring even to&#xD;
her fair neck; she thrust the letters in that same box II had&#xD;
seen on the dressing-table.&#xD;
"Are you afraid of me, cousin Grace ~ I asked. "IL can&#xD;
guess whom those letters are from; I won't betray you, or&#xD;
ask to hear any secrets you are not disposed to tell!"&#xD;
She smiled, and came to me, saying, ~IDon't you think&#xD;
we shall like each other, Cousin Kate? I always form&#xD;
&#xD;
friendships hastily,-..but now I am prudent enough, for&#xD;
Mary said herself she thought you were a good girl."&#xD;
"And will you be my friend, Grace ?"&#xD;
"Yes! indeed IL will!"&#xD;
After 'breakfast we returned to our room. I deleted&#xD;
whether IL should 4e11 Grace IL was bent upon going out some&#xD;
day to seek my fortune; I wanted to keep it a secret from&#xD;
Mr. &amp;amp;nd Mrs. iRodnian; IL could not endure the idea of taking&#xD;
Cousin John's advice in the matter, of being under his con-&#xD;
trol in the least. IL would rather do worse, and be my own&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
"Don't my clothes look dreadfully old-fashioned beside&#xD;
yours, Grace?" IL asked.&#xD;
"They do!" she laughci~d. "IL wonder if I can't help&#xD;
you to alter them likemine. IL will sew for you, but IL have&#xD;
no dress-making skill. Can ~ou lead off?"&#xD;
"IL can try. 1 regret so much that grandmother made&#xD;
such a child of me. I have learned more about sewing since&#xD;
I have been here than T ever knew before. In our circum-&#xD;
staneCs, IL ought to have learnt a trade, or have been educated&#xD;
for a teacher."&#xD;
"Don't you feel at home here?"&#xD;
"IL begin to feel a good deal at home,-it would be very&#xD;
hard for me to leave here now. But it would be better for&#xD;
me, as an orphan, to seek some means whereby I might be in-&#xD;
dependent of present circumstances. IL do not know what&#xD;
lies before me in the Tuture. It is not pleasant to me to be&#xD;
a burden on Cousin John's bounty."&#xD;
"Kate, how can you say so, when you are so useful in the&#xD;
family? Sister Mary has a seamstress a great part of the&#xD;
time. You save her that expense. IL beard her this morn-&#xD;
ing saying a few words to brother John about paying you a&#xD;
salary for your aid."&#xD;

32            UNCLE JOHNS CHARACTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Did you hear his reply?" I asked, not wholly able to&#xD;
repress a bitter accent.&#xD;
"No!" she answered, coloring, "I left the room." In a&#xD;
few moments she added: "I think, Kate, you mind Mr;&#xD;
Rodman's manner too much: I have known of a great many&#xD;
noble acts of his. He has redeeming qualities."&#xD;
"I never saw themi" burst from my lips with a sudden&#xD;
energy that startled me. I repented the words the moment&#xD;
they were uttered.&#xD;
'Grace said, "We arc used to him: he is more morose of&#xD;
late than he used to be. He treats us all alike: if any thing&#xD;
he is more complaisant to you, as a late member of the&#xD;
family, than the rest of us."&#xD;
"I have observed it~ I thought at first his moroseness&#xD;
was occasioned by my entrance into the family. If I had&#xD;
had one friend in Boston beside Cousin Mary, Ii should not&#xD;
have spent my second night under this roof. But as you say,&#xD;
I see that his coldness of manner extends to all. I wonder&#xD;
what makes him seem so gloomy and dissatisfied!"&#xD;
"I wish I knew!" returned Grace, with a sigh. "Mary&#xD;
spends her life in trying to remove annoyances from hi~&#xD;
path.. I cannot but pray God that her sacrificing efforts n1a~r&#xD;
not all be in vain. Once in a while I see an expression of&#xD;
dreary hopelessness come over her face; it goes to my heart&#xD;
so! She never confides to me her feelings, but I should, be&#xD;
blind indeed if I did not read them."&#xD;
"He is a professing Christian?" I said, half question-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
"Certainly! He is not the only one whose heavenly zeal&#xD;
has died out. But, Kate, he is not aware that he has so far&#xD;
forgotten the S~viour's life and example on earth. I think&#xD;
those who wander far from love and God should lie cared for&#xD;
with tenfold more devotion than those who readily keep the&#xD;
narroW way.. It seems right that each of us should bend our&#xD;
&#xD;
silent efforts towards him, because he needs forbearance, in-&#xD;
dulgence and good feeling.~~&#xD;
".1 can feel so for a moment, but my Christian forbear-&#xD;
ance is constantly upset. However, T am going to try to&#xD;
indulge a better spirit. Still, Grace, I am human enough to&#xD;
desire to show him that he does not contribute in the least&#xD;
t6 ards my support. I am going out this afternoon, to see&#xD;
if cannot obtairf some kind of plain sewing at the stores:&#xD;
the I shall pay my board regularly into the family. I wish&#xD;
I c uld teach."&#xD;
"Are you not competent?"&#xD;
"No!"&#xD;
"I'll give you lessons, Kate, with pleasure. It wouhi be&#xD;
a n miserable thing for you to sew all your life."&#xD;
"I know it. There is a restlessness in my nature that&#xD;
wo ld prevent me from doing it contentedly. I thank you&#xD;
with all my heart for your offer. When shall we begin?"&#xD;
'This evening, if you choose. Oh, no! to-morrow," she&#xD;
add d, laughing and blushing. "Mr. Benzoni is coming to&#xD;
tea o-night, and he will spend the evening."&#xD;
he children came running into the room. "Come,&#xD;
Aui t Grace," cried Josephine, "it is school-time."&#xD;
ow lovely the child looked, albeit not a regular beauty:&#xD;
her luxuriant wealth of ringlets are her crown of glory.&#xD;
Her eyes are blue, and not large, but when she raises her&#xD;
lashes,. and looks up in one's face, there is a world of con-&#xD;
fiding innocence revealed, that makes one dream of heaven:&#xD;
and this innocence rests upon her lips, it speaks in her voice,&#xD;
and in her childish, graceful bearing. She has a lovely form,&#xD;
such an one as Grace must have had when a child. Grace&#xD;
went to her daily duties in the school-room with the children.&#xD;
She left me fashioning one of my dresses after the model of&#xD;
hers.&#xD;
After dinner I arrayed myself in it, and was agreeably&#xD;

&#xD;
surprised to find what a difference a modern dress made in&#xD;
my appearance, not that it transformed me into an elegant-&#xD;
looking young lady, but it rescued me from looking unusually&#xD;
awkward. Grace came into our chamber while it was turn-&#xD;
ing around before the glass with great complacency.&#xD;
"Haven't I rather l'air distingu6, Miss Percival?" I&#xD;
exclaimed, laughing, as it saw a smile on- her lip. "Do it&#xD;
pronounce that French sentence properly?"&#xD;
"Yes. But, Kitty, how much better you look? And&#xD;
how nicely it fits!" turning me around, that she might ex-&#xD;
amine the dress. It todk up my bonnet to put it on, after she&#xD;
had satisfied herself with praising my made-over black silk.&#xD;
She took my bonnet from my hand.&#xD;
"Trim it over, Kate. itt looks s~ st1l~ and forlorn ! "&#xD;
in a few moments she had ripped a~l the ribbon off my&#xD;
straw bonnpt, and was running do~n stairs to iron it&#xD;
smoothly, bidding me take out the inside trimming while she&#xD;
was gone. In half an hour, by dint ~f our united sugges-&#xD;
tions and labors, my bonnet wore an in~pr6ved appearance.&#xD;
I sallied forth into the street with tremulous but deter-&#xD;
min~ed courage. A sky of tender, azur4 clearness bent above&#xD;
me: a light wind sprang up as I saun~ered on, looking now&#xD;
at the store windows, now at the passers-by, and then up into&#xD;
the pure depths above. For ever they bend down the same,&#xD;
albeit the fluctuating clouds, like human fortunes, may con-&#xD;
ceal the tranquillity beyond. I scarcely knew where to go,&#xD;
and yet I paced on with assurance and hope. Humble as&#xD;
my errand was, it was to me as important as a far more&#xD;
ambitious scheme might have been to a wealthy merchant or&#xD;
millionnaire. My heart beat hastily as I came to a large&#xD;
clothing store: I saw several ~shirts in the window for ex-&#xD;
hibition, and looked at them eagerly, wondering if I could&#xD;
make them look as smooth. Within I saw a fashionably&#xD;
dressed lady, buying a suit of clothes for ,a little boy: the&#xD;
&#xD;
shopkeeper looked so smiling and pleasant, I gathered up&#xD;
my courage, and ~went in, While the lady was engaged with&#xD;
her little boy, the clerk tm~rned to inc with the same agree-&#xD;
able smile, and asked what I would have.&#xD;
"JIi~ve you shirts to give out?" it asked, with less of&#xD;
trepidation than I had supposed I could get along with.&#xD;
"Ah!" said the young man, as a somewhat different ex-&#xD;
pression came over bis countenance. The lady turned to&#xD;
him, and with his courteous manner he exclaimed, "Those fit&#xD;
admirably, madam! Shall we send them home?"&#xD;
"You may; "returned the lady, with - something of the&#xD;
haughty air the clerk had used towards me. She scanned&#xD;
me coldly, even disdainf~mlly, although I could not see why&#xD;
she should do so: on her superficial face might be read idol-&#xD;
atry for the outward trappings of life, rather than an appre-&#xD;
ciation for wealth that may light up the inward world. It&#xD;
was my first lesson in regard to one of the effects of poverty.&#xD;
However, it did not lessen me in my own esteem, it merely&#xD;
made me indulge in some very indignant rind uncii~iritable&#xD;
feelings, and led me to ask how far others can injure our&#xD;
souls without a spoken word: perhaps it did me good, for&#xD;
there sprang up ill my heart a fervent prayer that I might&#xD;
ever look upon those poorer than myself as God's own chil-&#xD;
dren. The lady disappeared, and then the clerk said,&#xD;
"You want work, do you ?"&#xD;
I bowedand said "Yes."&#xD;
"Are you a good sewer?"&#xD;
It looked at a pile of shirts lying on the counter, and&#xD;
said, "I can sew as well as this!" I began to feel all my&#xD;
courage ebb away: it was not restored by the young man's&#xD;
~~aying,&#xD;
"That is your say so! How am I to know whether you&#xD;
can sew as well ?"&#xD;
The color rushed into my face at his tone: a choking~ in&#xD;

36                    TnEILE Is iviy&#xD;
&#xD;
n~y throat ~prevented me from speaking for a moment. I&#xD;
hesitated between pride and necessity. How could Ii go&#xD;
home unsuccessful? how could I subject myself to meeting&#xD;
this supercilious clerk often? The remembrance of my&#xD;
needs, the heavy chain of dependence on Cousin John, con-&#xD;
queved. I said, "I think I can bring a sample of my work&#xD;
to show you."&#xD;
An older man came forward to get a. pile of cloth from&#xD;
the shelf: he caught sight of my flushed face and half quiv-&#xD;
ering lips.&#xD;
'~Take this cloth to that gentleman, and wait on hini, will&#xD;
you ?" 'he said severely to the clerk, who obeyed. How&#xD;
grateful I was for the kind voice that said,&#xD;
"Do you want work, my dear?"&#xD;
I bowed silently: the hardly restrained tea~s dropped at&#xD;
his paternal accent.&#xD;
"What is your name?" he asked. I gave it to him. He&#xD;
kept his eyes upon the bundle he handed me, that he might&#xD;
not seem to see my agitation. "Can you bring theni back&#xD;
next week?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. IL thank you very much!" I looked at him&#xD;
as I spoke, and saw that he understood why I thanked hi~i.&#xD;
"Not at all, my dear!" he answered. "There is no&#xD;
more obligation on your side than on mine. We must have&#xD;
them made."&#xD;
I went away, blessing him from the warmest depths of my&#xD;
heart. I hastened home, not as exultant as I expected I&#xD;
should be, with the means of independence in my hands, yet&#xD;
very much relieved and sobered after the last hour's expe-&#xD;
rience. Grace was sewing in our chamber when Ii entered.,&#xD;
"There is my fortune!" I exclaimed, tossing my bundle&#xD;
on the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE next morning I settled myself down to my new business&#xD;
with cheerful, invigorated hopes. began to feel as if I had&#xD;
a right to live, now that I could take care of myself. ~The&#xD;
house seemed more really ~tike a hon~e to me; even our cham-&#xD;
ber seemed brightened with an air ~f welcome and independ-&#xD;
ence. While I was thus pleasantl~~* musing, Grace caine in,&#xD;
exclaiming, "Throw down your work fo~r to-day, Kate.&#xD;
Mr. Benzoni is going to take us all to Mount Auburn!&#xD;
Won't it be delightful? lie has just gone, and will return&#xD;
for us at ten o'clock."&#xD;
Thus she spoke, with a radiant countenance; she looked&#xD;
so very happy, so much more hap~y than the mere fact of&#xD;
going to Mount Auburn warranted~ when she had been there&#xD;
a few days before, that I was wondering how her thoughts&#xD;
ran. "How you will enjoy it, I I~te; you have never been&#xD;
there: and sister Mary so seldom goes out; it will refresh&#xD;
her so much! Mr. Benzoni said tl~e boys must go too; the&#xD;
carriage will hold nine with the driver."&#xD;
"What shall I wear? What shall I wear?" exclaimed&#xD;
Gertrude and Josephine in a breath, as they rushed into the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
* "Come down stairs, pets," answered Grace; "you shall&#xD;
wear your clean pink calicos. W~ will ride beyond Mount&#xD;
Auburn, and take our dinner in an apple orchard. "Oh! I&#xD;

THE PICNIC.                 39&#xD;
&#xD;
38                 A FINE PICTURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
must pack some provisions for us. Why, Kate!" and Grace&#xD;
started back from the head of the stairs, "wouldn't it be&#xD;
pleasant to have Mr. and Miss Cardover go with us, or meet&#xD;
us if they cannot start when we do?"&#xD;
"Yes, that would be charming! they are people after&#xD;
my own~heart!"&#xD;
Kitti~"~ send them word. Wear your hair in ringlets,&#xD;
Will you?"&#xD;
"Mr. Benzoni likes it better this way. Wasn't it&#xD;
thoughtful in him to take us all out this fine day?"&#xD;
"It was very kind.". Grace went down stairs, and now&#xD;
I had the key to her thoughts. It was a kind and thought-&#xD;
ful act on her lover's part, that illuminated her whole being;&#xD;
it delighted her that we were all to have a festival. I have&#xD;
noticed in Mr~ Benzoni a disposition quite different from that&#xD;
of his betrothed; he seems to think and care little for the&#xD;
happiness of others. Perhaps Grace divines this, but I&#xD;
know she does not acknowledge it to herself-her love gives&#xD;
a pure coloring to all his words and acts. Mr. Benzoni is all&#xD;
devotion, a~nd yet when II see Grace's eye beam with a gene-&#xD;
rous sentiment, and hear her pour out her frank enthusiasm&#xD;
for a noble deed, Ii look to see if the same heart beats in her&#xD;
lover's breast. He usually smiles and looks admiringly upon&#xD;
the animated face that turns to him for sympathy-Grace&#xD;
reads it in his smile. He- admires her beautiful emotion as&#xD;
he would -a fine picture; he does not feel it with her. And&#xD;
yet she may be the appointed one to kindle within his soul&#xD;
purer fires of humanity. Ii have even thought sometimes that&#xD;
she would charm him more' if she were not so heavenly pure,&#xD;
so thoroughly unsuspecting. When her inner nature unfolds&#xD;
itself like a fragrant flower, I almost fancy Mr~ Beuzoni' s&#xD;
spirit reiuoves to a distance, land doss not return to her with&#xD;
delight until she enters the outer court of her being.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Cousin Kate, 0-race says, wiil you run down, and see&#xD;
whether Mr. Bedell or Mr. 0-ray will go with us to-day, be-&#xD;
cause father will want one of them at the store." Jose-&#xD;
phine put her head in the door with this message, and ran&#xD;
away again. I proceeded to the dining-room where the&#xD;
young men were sitting, and asked which of them could go&#xD;
to our picnic.&#xD;
'~ Picnic!" echoed Walter, "Who are going?"&#xD;
"The family and Mr. Benzoni~"&#xD;
"No one else?"&#xD;
"Perhaps Mr. Cardover andI~is sister."&#xD;
"Why not have one or two m9re?"&#xD;
"Perhaps we may. But whic~i of you will go?"&#xD;
"Take your choice, James," s~dd Walter.&#xD;
"I cannot possibly go to-day~ I have an engagement&#xD;
this afternoon," said Mr. Bedell.&#xD;
"0, true! The young idea &amp;amp;c ," laughed Walter gayly.&#xD;
"Here am I, Miss Hamilton. Th~ee cheers for the picnic."&#xD;
Walter's cap whizzed in the air, a~id his three cheers made&#xD;
the windows rattle. "Wouldn't you like to have Miss Mor-&#xD;
ton go, and Frank? He would be company for the chil-&#xD;
dren."&#xD;
"Shall II ask 0-race? Mr. Be~zoni is to take us all."&#xD;
"I'll get a carriage for Miss Morton and the children."&#xD;
Don't make such rapid advances to Miss Morton. I&#xD;
think there is a spice of coquetry in her nature. She will&#xD;
th~nk twice as much of you if it tales a great while to bring&#xD;
yo to her feet."&#xD;
"Will she?"&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
At ten o'clock we were all seated in the carriage; Miss&#xD;
Morton and Walter occupied the kek scat. Mr. and Miss&#xD;
Cardover were to meet us at the Cemetery in the afternoon.&#xD;
"Crack went the whip, round went the wheels," and we&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8254-00000021"/>&#xD;
dashed away in a delightful exhilaration of spirits, flow de-&#xD;
licious seemed the country air, after having been shut up in&#xD;
the city nearly two months. it was a day for fancy to ride&#xD;
free; to cleave with her shining wings the joyous air, and&#xD;
mount up to the heaven of her hopes. It was a day to dream&#xD;
of love, love only, pure and undefiled-a day in which it is&#xD;
natural for the young heart to inquire whether in all the beau-&#xD;
tiful universe there beats another heart capable of responding&#xD;
to all that is best, and highest, and holiest within-a day in&#xD;
which the well-spring of gratitude overflows to God for the&#xD;
gift of being; yet, with this gratitude, there mingles an&#xD;
aching sense of something distant and divine which we can-&#xD;
not reach. The soul of the universe murmurs a melody to&#xD;
the inward spirit, which awakens all its deep unsatisfied&#xD;
yearnings. Oh, to understand that the hour to read the mys-&#xD;
tery we~e now&#xD;
I could not but catch the conversation between Walter&#xD;
and Judith; indeed they were not conversing t~te-4-t~te.&#xD;
Walter would have had it so, but Miss Morton lightly threw&#xD;
off every approach to tenderness; she was too coquettish to&#xD;
seem ~o understand his ardent admiration; she gave a merry&#xD;
turn ~o words that alm4t trembled from his lips. She drew&#xD;
me into the conversation, and at last we were all looking&#xD;
around, and laughing and jesting with her-Mr. Benzoni more&#xD;
heartily than any of us. She did not often look at him, but&#xD;
she listened to hear his rich h~ughter, and then a fresh man-&#xD;
tle of fascination fell over her; she was so gay, so bewitchingg,&#xD;
who could forbear loving her? Our dear Grace was not so&#xD;
enchanting, and Mr. Beuzoni thought so. Oh, darling Grace,&#xD;
do you not see the thunderbolt overhead? Poesnot the air&#xD;
grow black, the green leaves folded over your heart wither?&#xD;
No! oh, no! Faith sits at her heart, and she looks at Ju-&#xD;
dith with her sweet, kind eyes, and laughs joyously. But&#xD;
we grow more silent as we enter amid the silent graves of&#xD;
&#xD;
Mount Auburn. We had not wandered long, when Miss Car-&#xD;
dover and her brother joined us; the former sought Cousin&#xD;
Mary, and the latter, with a quick glance, scanned the party,&#xD;
until his eye rested upon Miss Morton. After a few kind&#xD;
words to Josephine and myself, he left us and joined the&#xD;
group near Judith. All were absorbed in some eager inter-&#xD;
est but myself, and a homeless pang struck my heart. I&#xD;
seci~ied ~o unnecessary to the happiness of the party; no one&#xD;
wilfully neglected me, and it was the merest accident or my&#xD;
own reserve that prevented me f~rom joining the others. Jo-&#xD;
sephine drew me to a conspicuous monument; I sat down&#xD;
upon a grave, and thought of the last time I had been in a&#xD;
churchyard, and of the friend who had' lately been laid undei1&#xD;
the sod. I could have bowed m~r face down upon the green&#xD;
earth, and have wept with all my soul, but it would not do.&#xD;
A few tears fell, and Josephine observed it.&#xD;
"What is it, Cousin Kate ?" she asked very softly.&#xD;
"I was thinking of my grandmother, darling; you know&#xD;
it is not long since I saw her buried."&#xD;
The child looked down thoughtfully, and then, with an&#xD;
artless attempt at consolation; said, " But she isn't in the&#xD;
ground, she is living in Heaven."&#xD;
Her words struck the right vein. Why should I weep&#xD;
over earthly loneliness, instead of lifting my pyes to the life&#xD;
hereafter? Why wish that another's heavenly joy should&#xD;
be bartered for earth again, in order that I might be a little&#xD;
more at home?&#xD;
"All these people are in the spiritual world, Cousin Kate,&#xD;
are they ?",and Josephine pointed to tile many graves.&#xD;
"Mother says so."&#xD;
I assented. Glorious revealing of a better world were&#xD;
filling my spirit with an unwanted light. Bands of shining&#xD;
2 angels seemed lifting up my thoughts from earth, opening to&#xD;
me a career broad and bright as eternity. What if I seemed&#xD;

AFFECTION..&#xD;
&#xD;
TUE DINNER.&#xD;
&#xD;
of little value in the lowly path where I was, it could still&#xD;
lead upward. Many millions of earth's children had passed&#xD;
through their discipline, and the faithful and heaveii-hearted&#xD;
were filling out their destiny in a happier sphere. Life, sweet&#xD;
life, should nevel7 be torn front me. The blessed child at my&#xD;
side should never perish; she should bloom in heaven, where&#xD;
her opening grace's should refresh others as they refreshed&#xD;
me. There descended into my soul a quiet conviction that&#xD;
my present eireum~tanees were fitted with a divine nicety to&#xD;
my real needs, provided I sought out a health-giving element&#xD;
in them. I lifted Josephine OR my knee, and talked with&#xD;
her a long time, sometimes telling her a story, and sometimes&#xD;
answe~'ing the questions she asked. It 'is always a cordial&#xD;
and solace to turn from selfish refining to impart instruction&#xD;
to a ~hild. Every unquiet feeling had vaPshed, when at&#xD;
last her blue eyes were raised earnestly to mine, for I saw&#xD;
far back in their depths a prayer of inquiry for the holy way.&#xD;
She said iiothing as this~ look came into her face, but she&#xD;
clasped her lovely arms around my neck, and pressed her&#xD;
soft kisses on my cheek.&#xD;
"Let us go'find the others, dear," I said, rising. At the&#xD;
same moment Ii heard them calling us. Grace came in sight,&#xD;
exclaiming,&#xD;
"Oh, here you are !" She was followed by Mr. Benzoni,&#xD;
Walter and Judith. The quick eyes of Grace. scanne~ my&#xD;
face, as if to learn why I had not been with the others. She&#xD;
seemed satisfied with the cheerful expression she met, both&#xD;
on my own countenance and that of Josephine. We rambled&#xD;
away to the carriage, which was to convey us to a neighbor-&#xD;
ing orchard for dinner. Only bright smiling eyes met me,&#xD;
and cordial words. Thus I learned, that when we feel neg-&#xD;
lectedit is often because we desire to draw more from others&#xD;
than they can very well spare. , When we meet them in a&#xD;
generous spirit, and are willing that they should act out the&#xD;
&#xD;
frankness of their hearts, we are met ourselves with a like&#xD;
candor and warmth. It was not long before we had assem-&#xD;
bled under a spreading apple tree in the orchard, merrily&#xD;
engaged in laying our table-cloth on the grass, and spreading&#xD;
out the noontide meal. The~ gentlemen were dispatched f~r&#xD;
water, stones for seats, and on various other commissions to&#xD;
beguile their impatience, real or pretended, for dinner. Ju-&#xD;
dith was all animation, jesting now with one, now with&#xD;
another; ever and anon chatting with Grace in gentle tones,&#xD;
then turning to answer some gay sally from Walter or Mr.&#xD;
Cardover. But there was one dark eye that she met some-&#xD;
times and blushed; then it seemed treason when she talked&#xD;
gently with Grace. I watched her 'countenance and gestures&#xD;
with great curiosity, for she was a problem to me. I could&#xD;
not decide whether some heart and generosity might lurk&#xD;
beneath all her lightness, or whether she was artful in the&#xD;
eXtrClnC.&#xD;
Dinner oven we went back to the cemetery. Miss Car-&#xD;
dover sat down and motioned Grace and me to sit beside her.&#xD;
The others were slowly walking about in a quiet mood. Mr.&#xD;
i3enzuni walked beside Cousin Mary and the children, but&#xD;
his glances sought Judith. She wandered hither and thither&#xD;
to look at various inscriptions; all her' levity.was gone. Mr.&#xD;
Cardover joined her; I heard him say, in a low tone,&#xD;
"Does it sadden you to come to a place like this?" and&#xD;
he looked down in her beautiful face, with the approving&#xD;
gaze she so often won.&#xD;
"It does how! " she softly answered, and her large liquid&#xD;
eyes dwelt on the scene; then she laid her i'ose-tinted cheek&#xD;
against a marble stone, and the eyes of her companion rested&#xD;
on her, as if she had been a heavenly madonna. With the&#xD;
outward adorning of an angel what a glorified of life might&#xD;
she be. I could not but hope her youi~g feet would tread&#xD;
lightly ox~er the roses of adulation, and that on a quiet re-&#xD;

44                TUE PURE IN HEART.&#xD;
~trospect, the subtle shapes of temptation would apPe~ar to&#xD;
her in their true character. She left Mr. Cardover to sit&#xD;
beside Josephine, who was in vain trying to make a wreath&#xD;
of green leaves and wild flowers. Judith's little jewelled&#xD;
fingers glepmed brightly amid the dark green leaves of the&#xD;
wreath. Gertrude had just completed one which she laid&#xD;
upon the graceful head of the young girl; smiles broke from&#xD;
every lip; the crown of flowers made her resplendent. Her&#xD;
surpassing beauty awoke bewildering visions of the angels,&#xD;
who live and love in the "silent land." How entrancingly&#xD;
beautiful must they be, the pure in heart, whose ~wcetness&#xD;
shines from~ within; whose. loveliness grows more dazzling&#xD;
amid the "diamond life" of heaven! Such a celestial one&#xD;
would Grace become !-such a noontide splendor of beauty&#xD;
awaited her. I turned to look at her; all color had retreated&#xD;
from her face, and her lips were white; her eyes were fixed&#xD;
up~on Mr. Beuzoni with an indescribable expression of suffer-&#xD;
ing and entreaty; a dreadful surprise was in her look; she&#xD;
saw the thunderbolt. He was gazing upon Judith with a&#xD;
strange passionate ardor. "Come and see this design!" I&#xD;
said, taking her hand. She gasped for breath, and followed&#xD;
me. She looked at the figure I pointed out and murmured&#xD;
*" Yes ! "-then she sat down, saying ~he was very tired. We&#xD;
sat there voiceless for a long time; it was a sheltered nQok,&#xD;
a safe hiding-place. At last she breathed more freely;&#xD;
"Judith is very beautiful, is she not?" she asked.&#xD;
"Very!" said I. "Every one looks on beauty with de~&#xD;
light, but we often admire greatly where we could not&#xD;
love!"&#xD;
"Yes!" and the light of hope came slowly over her&#xD;
face; her deadly paleness had gradually rcce4ed.&#xD;
"I hear them inquiring for us," said I, after another&#xD;
long silence. At this moment Mr. Benzoni caught a glimpse&#xD;
of our dresses, and came to us. He took both of Grace's&#xD;
&#xD;
A WOMAN'S REASON.                45&#xD;
hands in his, crc he drew h~r from her retreat. "Why have&#xD;
you hidden from me so long, dearest?" he asked, drawing&#xD;
her arm within his.&#xD;
"Oh! becse; a Woman's reason!" and she looked up&#xD;
in his face with such joy, such a fullness of confiding love.&#xD;
She was upbraiding herself for her foolish suspicions. It&#xD;
was time to go home. The sunshine, all mellow and soft,&#xD;
gilded the tree tops; a dim, religious light was in the shaded&#xD;
dells, and a flood of amber streamed and lost itself in many&#xD;
an opening vista. Mr. Benzoni w~s very attentive to Grace&#xD;
during the drive home; he did ilot even glance at Judith;&#xD;
she amused herself with Walter, whose eyes shone as if he&#xD;
Were in the seventh heaven of happiness. Frank Morton,&#xD;
Gertrude and Josephine, had managed to crowd down on the&#xD;
bottom of the carriage, and were pretending to sleep, but&#xD;
every moment or two there was an explosFon~ of laughter&#xD;
from them that betrayed intense wakefulness. The prim&#xD;
red brick house seemed very much like home when we&#xD;
reached it.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
TUE moon came shining into the parlor in full effulgence,&#xD;
casting the foliage of the sycamore tree in front of the&#xD;
house, in shadow upon the carpet. - The lightly waving&#xD;
shadows, the soft unrealness about the room, the pure se-&#xD;
renity of the evening disposed Grace and myself into a con-&#xD;
fiding mood., The dining-room door stood ajar, and Mr.&#xD;
iRodmafi's petulant voice reached our ears; he was in con-&#xD;
versation with his wife.&#xD;
"Oh, John!" we heard her say, "how cheerfully Ii could&#xD;
bear aTly thing to lighten your burdens. Poverty seems to&#xD;
me an evil so much lighter than many others."&#xD;
"You know nothing about it," he replied. " You women&#xD;
are 'so sentimental. You know nothingg of the hard knocks&#xD;
men get in contact with the world. Your sympathy is all&#xD;
%lk; it don't help th~ matter any."&#xD;
Cousin Mary was silent. In a few moments Mr. Rod-&#xD;
man rose, and as he left the room he said, "Good evening,&#xD;
~ in a softer voice.&#xD;
"Good evening, ~ohu!" she returned, but there were&#xD;
tears in her voice. A~nd then we heard a suppressed weep-&#xD;
ing after he had left her. She rose, and wc~nt to her chain-&#xD;
ber.&#xD;
"What does it mean'?" II asked, looking into the wistful&#xD;
countenance of Grace.&#xD;
&#xD;
CC ~ don't know, 12 am sure," she answered. "John must&#xD;
have business difficulties. Perhaps that accounts for his be-&#xD;
ing less communicative lately than usual."&#xD;
"Probably; and for his being more cross than "-I was&#xD;
going to say-" than ever," but finished the sentence with&#xD;
"he used to be."&#xD;
"Suppose he should fail ?" suggested 0-race.&#xD;
"What should we do?" 11 asked, then added, "I am so&#xD;
tired of sewing all the time, and J earn so little. I can&#xD;
never be contented to vegetate away my days in this way.&#xD;
I am going to see if I cannot do something that will enlist&#xD;
my interest. I believe I could teach drawing by this time&#xD;
in schools. I could sew, also, and then 11 should seem to be&#xD;
living to greater purpose.~~&#xD;
"Kate!" said Grace, with energy, "I will make shirts,&#xD;
too. I feel convinced now from many little things that have&#xD;
dropped from Mary. and John, that pecuniary trouble is at&#xD;
hand. I believe John is greatly in debt. It would harass&#xD;
Mary beyond expression if our family expenses should not&#xD;
be met. I will sew with you, and not let Mary know it;&#xD;
then, when an hour of gr~at tribulation comes up~n her, I&#xD;
shall have a little fund to offer her."&#xD;
"That will be delightful !"&#xD;
"Yes; then we shall have the interest of my thousand&#xD;
dollars to help us, too. Let us g~ to our room, and begin to&#xD;
sew this minute!"&#xD;
We started up full o~ thusiasm. A tall, figure passed&#xD;
underneath the windo~' the moonlight I saw a sudden&#xD;
smile flash over the lips of Grace; she hastened to the door,&#xD;
and admitted Mr. Benzoni. After a few moments I again&#xD;
started to leave the room.&#xD;
"Don't go, Miss Kate," said Mr. Benzoni. "How&#xD;
would you like to go into the next. house to spend the even-&#xD;
ing? What do yoa say, 0-race?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8254-00000025"/>&#xD;
1'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let us go," she answered, but I imagined a sudden&#xD;
p~ain struck her heart.&#xD;
Mr. T3enzoni arose, and Grace with him. She threx~ her&#xD;
kerchief over her head, saying, "Come, Kate."&#xD;
"No!" IL returned; "I shall be busy this evening."&#xD;
"Oh, come!" she repeated, with a kind of imploring em-&#xD;
phasis.&#xD;
"No, not to-night. II feel like being very industrious."&#xD;
They went, and my heart smote me for not going also.&#xD;
I caught a sigh from Grace as she passed through the door,&#xD;
and instantly comprehended that it would have been a relief&#xD;
to have me at her side, in order to give the conversation a&#xD;
more general turn; when Judith exercised her fascinations.&#xD;
It was becoming plain to me that Judith was greatly at-&#xD;
tracted to Mr. Beuzoni; in the most artful ways she tried to&#xD;
captivate him; one thought of mercy for Grace never seemed&#xD;
to enter her mind. Occasionally she had dropped in to&#xD;
spend the evening, when Mr. Benzoni was present, but never&#xD;
before had he proposed going in there. She was not, satis-&#xD;
fied with winning Grace's lover fx~om her; she encouraged&#xD;
Walter, and kept him in a state between hope and fear all&#xD;
the time. Mr. Cardover had also been lured by her beauty&#xD;
and winning ways: with him she was gentle, pure and spir-&#xD;
itual, as far as she could ape spirituality. Ii could~ not help&#xD;
looking at her in two ways: I saw and recognized the be-&#xD;
witching gracefulness of her looks' and words; but often&#xD;
there seemed to gleam on me h~ 1, naked soul, through&#xD;
her eyes. She grew intensely r ant to me. Ii could&#xD;
not bear to see her enter the door, an' I knew that Grace's&#xD;
feelings were similar, tind more deeply painful, by the invol-&#xD;
untary coldness that overspread her face the instant Judith&#xD;
appeared. But with heroic effort Grace strove to banish the&#xD;
coldness from her manner, and was always gentle and polite,&#xD;
never dropping a sarcastic word, as I sometimes did. Ju-&#xD;
&#xD;
dith seemed determined to be intimate with both of us. II was&#xD;
with her most frequently, as Grace escaped whenever she could.&#xD;
I went to my room, and thought over Grace's positioji&#xD;
with Mr. Benzoni. He came as frequently as ever, and kept&#xD;
up the same outward seeming. IL could see that Grace did&#xD;
not give sufficient value to Judith's power of robbing her of&#xD;
her lover's affections; she still had confidence in'him; often&#xD;
there seemed real tenderness in his ~ and this kept&#xD;
hope alive in her heart. I sewed and thought, and thought&#xD;
and sewed. "Why must our darling be slighted for that&#xD;
white sepulchre?" and yet would it not be more pitiful&#xD;
still to see her Benzoni's wife? Should I entreat her to&#xD;
give him up at once? But how to meet her despair? Love&#xD;
to' her was life; there was a depth of passionate abai1don-&#xD;
ment in her soul which lessons of prudence never could&#xD;
reach; there was no worldliness, no calculation about her;&#xD;
she could smilingly sacrifice every thing to love, and bear&#xD;
long years of trial with a sublime patience, if he were at&#xD;
her side, and she could be a blessing to him. She' was no&#xD;
longer the exultant being she was upon the evening of her&#xD;
arrival home.&#xD;
The hour grew late, and I grew weary, and sought re-&#xD;
pose. I had not retired ma     utes before Grace came&#xD;
in. She glanced at the be       d not say any thing to&#xD;
me. There was a fire i           if she were deeply ex-&#xD;
cited, and the treacherou        guish glowed upon her&#xD;
cheek. Low sighs tre            lips; she sank upon a&#xD;
chair by the dressing-t       aned her head upon her&#xD;
hand in an attitude of in se study and thought. At last&#xD;
she~ shook her head 'slowly and murmured, "Oh, no! it can-&#xD;
not be!" and then with hasty action she fell upon her knees,&#xD;
and remained long in prayer, as if wrestling with the de-&#xD;
stroying angel, and beseeching him to pass by. When she&#xD;
arose, IL saw that she had been drowned in tears.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
"MA, can't we go to Lilly's school this afternoon?" pleaded&#xD;
Josephine, running out on the back piazza, where we all sat&#xD;
sewing. "Do you believe, Mr. KI3edell lectures there this af-&#xD;
ternoon on chemistry-don't he, Lilly 'U' appealing to that&#xD;
little damsel, who stood in the door, Jook~ng curiously into&#xD;

"Ho does; and he has lectured before," returned Lilly.&#xD;
"May the ~girls go 'U'&#xD;
"Is it possible James understands chemistry so well 'U'&#xD;

"Walter says he is ~n unusual student," answered&#xD;
cousin Mary. "He h energy than I supposed, to&#xD;
dare to give public lect&#xD;
"May we go, moth             sked Josey, putting on&#xD;

"You may go."   Wit            e assurance, the 'chil..&#xD;

"Let us go, Grace," said II, hoping to lighten the de-&#xD;
pression she strove to conce~il.&#xD;
"Perhaps you would like to go, Mary 'U' she said, look-&#xD;
ing at sister. Mary declined; so Grace and I started&#xD;
away with the children. We nodded in reply to Mrs. Rod-&#xD;
&#xD;
man's charge to keep the children in order. Lilly Cardover&#xD;
began to play pranks ~s soon as she left the door,~ delighting&#xD;
Josephine beyond me sure, who laughed until ~ was as&#xD;
red as a cherry. We recommended more propriety, while&#xD;
inwardly enjoying the delicious abandon of the little ones.&#xD;
Cousin Mary was so particular in the deportment of her&#xD;
children, it did my heart good to hear the laughter ringing&#xD;
out from Josephine's merry soul. Gertrude walked by her-&#xD;
self, at a little distance, every now and then casting reprov-&#xD;
ing glances upon the joyous children, and saying&#xD;
"I never saw such children. I am ashamed to walk&#xD;
with them. Josey! Josephine Rodman! How you do&#xD;
act&#xD;
IDuring such remarks a dead silence would prevail a sec-&#xD;
ond; Josey's hands would cover her mouth, while her ~nerry&#xD;
eyes turned to Lilly; then came a new and altogether un-&#xD;
conquerable explosion of mirth.&#xD;
"Let them be happy," said Grace, in a low voice; "they&#xD;
have elements of suffering within them that will be developed&#xD;
soon enough.~~&#xD;
We reached the school.~house and entered the hall; the&#xD;
lecture had begun. Lilly dragged the children in the lec-&#xD;
ture-room with her as noiselessly as possible. Recalling Mr.&#xD;
Bedell's bashfulness, Gr~ice and I hesitated about interrupt-&#xD;
ing him. The door was artly ajar; we could hear distinctly&#xD;
a strong sensible voice,  oring explanations iu a modest&#xD;
but assured manner; t      something in those tones that&#xD;
instantly convinced m      . Bedell was not an ordinary&#xD;
young man. I looked a    race with a sort of pride; her&#xD;
satisfied smile indicated the same feeling. At length the&#xD;
teacher espied us, and politely came to us to conduct us to a&#xD;
seat. When we had fairly ceased fluttering, and were ready&#xD;
to attend to the speaker, we became conscious that he was&#xD;
merely saying, " llowever-and-however..-...." while he looked&#xD;

very red and miserable: he crossed one foot over the other,&#xD;
then crossed back again. He drank a glass of water, and&#xD;
with a new effort commenced: "You will see that this is&#xD;
a "-he paused,. and took up a glass in which were different&#xD;
colored liquids; with a nervous hand he poured something&#xD;
into the glass from a vial; then he put a lid on. In a mo-&#xD;
ment there was an explosion; simultaneous shrieks arose&#xD;
from every part of the room; pieces of glass whizzed around&#xD;
and settled every where; the knob of the cover planted itself&#xD;
in the ceiling; the audience gave a bound towards the door,&#xD;
but when it was perceived that no great harm was done, the&#xD;
seats were resumed amid universal merriment. Lilly Cardo.~&#xD;
ver extracted a fragment of glass from her nose, and stanched&#xD;
the wound with a small piece of black silk. Mr. Bedell's&#xD;
white vest was adorned with red and green, also his face.&#xD;
"Rather an unfortunate accident!" he ~aid, as a cbn-&#xD;
strained smile flitted over his variegated countenance.&#xD;
Grace and I took Lilly out to doctor her wound ostensi-&#xD;
bly, but in reality to give vent to bursts of laughter. Grace&#xD;
dropped on the door-step, and laughed until her strength was&#xD;
gone, saying every other moment, "I am so sorry we came."&#xD;
When our composure was restored, she added, "Ah, Kate!&#xD;
what execution your eyes have done to-day! That explosion&#xD;
was a symbol of the state of his heart."&#xD;
".M~y eyes'?" I exclaimed,"it was your own I"&#xD;
"Mine!" and she lifted her e.. brows in smiling derision.&#xD;
I had long suspected that G more clear to James&#xD;
than she should be; often en him following her&#xD;
every movement, and then with den resolution he would&#xD;
turn away his eyes, perhaps to seize a book, or perchance his&#xD;
hat, in order to leave the house. One evening Walter had&#xD;
said to me, "I think Mr. Benzc~ni and Grace are not suited&#xD;
to each other!" James sat by, and instantly a flush over~&#xD;
spread his face. I did not speak of the certainty I felt that&#xD;
&#xD;
KATE'S WiSHES,&#xD;

&#xD;
James loved Grace; it could do no good, for she was insen-&#xD;
sible to all save one. Yet I secretly hoped that James&#xD;
would gradually win away Grace's interest from her lover;&#xD;
if she supposed he only entertained friendship for her, she&#xD;
would not be on her guard against him.&#xD;
"What are you studying about, Kate?" she asked, as&#xD;
these thoughts were passing through my mind. " This rev-&#xD;
elation has made you very profound. Do you care for him,&#xD;
Kate? "-she whispered the last sentence.&#xD;
"No, and never will," I replied quickly. "He does not&#xD;
care for me, except as a sincere friend."&#xD;
She smiled, and looked incredulous. Miss Holmes, the&#xD;
principal teacher, came out on the porch to talk with us.&#xD;
Lilly slipped away the moment she appeared. Miss Holmes&#xD;
observed it, and said: "Lilly seenis to be a little fearful of&#xD;
me yet. She was so wild when she first 'came to school I was&#xD;
obliged to be rather strict with her."&#xD;
"Is she studious?" Ii asked.&#xD;
"She has a taste for some branches; for drawing she has&#xD;
a positive talent. I am sorry our teacher is going to leave&#xD;
us soon."&#xD;
"Have you another engaged?" I inquired with sudden&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
"We have not." At this moment' some visitors ap-&#xD;
proached to speak with Miss Holmes about their respective&#xD;
children, so Grace and I took our leave. Before leaving the&#xD;
front door, however,, we looked far up the street to see if we&#xD;
should encounter James; We preferred that he should 'have&#xD;
time to compose~ his nerves before meeting with him. He&#xD;
was not in sight, and we sallied forth.&#xD;
We had not gone many steps when we encountered Mr.&#xD;
Waldron, our minister. His eyes were instantly riveted upon&#xD;
Grace, but he merely touched his hat and passed on. He&#xD;
had called once at our house, but we were absent.&#xD;

"I think," I said, "the reason his face is so attractive, is&#xD;
because it is the index of hi~ soul. You know sometimes the&#xD;
most charming characters have faces that do them great in-&#xD;
justice; we do not love them until we learn all that is be-&#xD;
yond the face."&#xD;
"Very true," returned Grace. I thought within myself&#xD;
that her face was charming, be cause it spoke forth the artless-&#xD;
ness arid purity within her.&#xD;
"Do you intend to apply for that situation as drawing-&#xD;
teacher, Kate?"&#xD;
"Yes. I shall send Miss Holmes a note to-morrow."&#xD;
"You know what we were talking~ about the other even-&#xD;
ing, Kate?" Grace said, looking in my eyes.&#xD;
"Yes; relative to Mr. Rodman's business.~~&#xD;
"It is all frue what we feared, K~te. John is~ on the&#xD;
verge of bankruptcy; he is dre~dful1y in debt. Mary told&#xD;
me this mor~ning. He has neglected his business during the&#xD;
past year to speculate in something, I hardly know what, and&#xD;
all his means are swallowed up.&#xD;
"Will he never be able to pay his debts?" I asked, hor-&#xD;
rifled at such a state ~of things.&#xD;
"I don't know. * Isn't jit~discouraging? NV~i have always&#xD;
lived in perfectly puritanical styl that John might use all&#xD;
his funds in making more money~ Now it proves that we&#xD;
might have enjoy&amp;amp; life much better, and at this time we.&#xD;
would not be robbing others of thejr own. I always felt that&#xD;
it was a great mistake in John to be for ever looking to the&#xD;
future, instead of making the present bright and cheery; the&#xD;
proceeds of his business, two years ago, were amply sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
to supply the family with every want, and even with a great&#xD;
many luxuries; and then he had a surplus for the poor, and&#xD;
something to lay aside. It is so hard to be reconciled when&#xD;
misfortune is brougjit about by an unwise policy. Still,"&#xD;
and Grace looked up with determined faith, "I am perfectly&#xD;
confident that this rnisf6rtune will be- better for all of us&#xD;
than prosperity."&#xD;
"What does Mary say?" I inquired.&#xD;
"She speaks like an angel," Grace returned with pas-&#xD;
sionate affection. "She says in the depths of hex' aching&#xD;
anxiety there is a hope that some celestial wealth~ will reach&#xD;
John through this thwarting of his plans. She besought me&#xD;
to be patient witk him, for he suffers acutely, and he has for&#xD;
a loPg time."&#xD;
"We will strive to make home serene an&amp;amp;tranquil to him,"&#xD;
I said with a sudden enthusiasm. "I can make allowance&#xD;
for his moodiness now. I wish I had always felt as C@usin&#xD;
Mary does the worth of his soul." We reached home, talk-&#xD;
ing quietly, earnestly, tearfully. A holier link seemed tg&#xD;
bind my heart to the family as grief drew near, and develQ&#xD;
the still, strong sweetness of Cousin Mary's na~ture.&#xD;

KATE 'S DRAWINGS.              57&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER; VII.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE next day I dispatched a note and a few specimens of&#xD;
my drawings to Miss Holmes. Josephine Was my note-&#xD;
bearer. On her rej~urn, she handed me a' little billet saying&#xD;
that Miss Holmes was well suited with the specimens I sent&#xD;
her, and would decide by the next day between myself and&#xD;
another lady; she feared I would not be satisfied with the&#xD;
salary, which would be but fifty dollars a year. I read the&#xD;
)~Qte with satisfaction; the salary was as much as I expected.&#xD;
ould not miss the time devoted to teaching, it would be&#xD;
ange from sewing. I felt quite confident of my success&#xD;
i~A~ obtaining the situation, the opening seemed so providen-&#xD;
tial at this juncture. The ensuing morning I listened for&#xD;
the postman's rap with eagerness and transient misgivings.&#xD;
At length the knocker sounded. I hastened to the door, and&#xD;
received a note bearing these words:&#xD;
"II regret, Miss Hamilton, to state that the situation you&#xD;
desired is taken by a personal friend of mine whom I could&#xD;
not refuse.&#xD;
"Yours, most tj~uly,&#xD;
"JANE HoLMES."&#xD;
It was a very severe disappointment at this time. I stole&#xD;
into the parlor that I might digest my distress alone. I had&#xD;
pleased myself with thinking that I should now be able to&#xD;
&#xD;
pay more for my board, thus showing Cousin Nary that II&#xD;
appreciated all her nameless kindnesses to me. I dropped&#xD;
my face in my hands, and was just on the point of having a&#xD;
good crying spell, when a familiar voice exclaimed,&#xD;
"Miss Kate!" and Mr. Cardover stood by me.&#xD;
"II didn't see you," I said, with some embarrassment, for&#xD;
it ~vas very unpleasant to stop crying at 'the outset.&#xD;
" Because you were reading your letter as you came in,"&#xD;
lie returned. "I am sorry to disturb you. I was waiting&#xD;
for Mr. iRodman.",&#xD;
"It's no matter," I answered. Then thinking he might&#xD;
suppose some great calamity 4d overtaken me, I said,&#xD;
~~Thisnoteisfroma'lady~hohas disappointed a~lan&#xD;
of mine. It is not very serious. ]I will see~ if Mr. Rodman&#xD;
is at home."&#xD;
Mr. Cardover looked at ,me half-inquiringly, half-hesi-&#xD;
tatingly. "Could II advance your plans in any way?" he&#xD;
asked very kindly, yet with a delicacy that I felt. "I am&#xD;
aware of Mr. IRodman's difficulties."&#xD;
"II hoped to become a teacher of drawing and painting,"&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"AhI "~'he returned quickly. "Will you show me your&#xD;
pictures? Jthink~canveryeasilybeofservicetoyou."&#xD;
II hurried to the nursery for my drawings with a suddenly&#xD;
'lightened heart. I felt somewhat ashamed of them, for I&#xD;
had a very exalted idea of Mr. Cardover's taste and judg-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"iii have not taken lessons but three months," I said as IL&#xD;
returned to the parlor and laid them before him. "I should&#xD;
try very hard to improve."&#xD;
He looked carefully over the lot without saying any thing&#xD;
for a few moments.&#xD;
"You will paint well, Miss Kate, with care and prac-&#xD;
tice," he said at last.&#xD;
&#xD;
57&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8254-00000030"/>&#xD;
58                A HAPPY MOMENT.&#xD;
My heart gave a delighted hound. I had never excelled&#xD;
in any thing, and it came upon me as a surprise that Ii could&#xD;
at some time accomplish something which Mr. Cardover would&#xD;
think well done.&#xD;
"Would you like to paint for mq?" hQ asked.&#xD;
"You are very kind," i[ returned, "but my insignificant&#xD;
pictures would not look very well beside the fine ones you&#xD;
offer for sale. I should be very glad to paint for you, hut-."&#xD;
I colored painfully, for a new thought struck me.&#xD;
"Bgt what?"&#xD;
"Ii am afraid you do not care about the pictures, only to&#xD;
help me."&#xD;
"You are entirely mistaken there, Miss Kate. You saw&#xD;
the other day when you visited my store with Grace ithat I&#xD;
kept all kinds. I had some similar to these. I will lend&#xD;
you good models, and I do not do~ibt that I shall find your&#xD;
pictures indispensable in time. Will you enter into an ar-&#xD;
rangement?" he asked, smiling. "Shall I send you sme&#xD;
models to-morrow?"&#xD;
"If you please. I th~~nk you. with all my heart," I said&#xD;
smiling, for his cordial manner assured me.&#xD;
"You must regard your work as a constant study; you&#xD;
must improve on every picture for your own sake, will&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Oh, I will / I shall try to compose pictmwes when I&#xD;
have had more practice.&#xD;
" That is right."&#xD;
Mr. Rodman here came in, and I went up stairs to relate&#xD;
my happy fortmie to Grace. Ero I sat down to finish my&#xD;
sewing, I could not resist the pleasure of bringing in a little&#xD;
table, and placing it under the windows to paint on; then,&#xD;
with a new zeal, I looked over my pencils, brushes and&#xD;
paints, and placed theni all in order on the table; then I laid&#xD;
out different sized sheets of drawing-paper, musing the while&#xD;
&#xD;
A WRONG DECISION.             59&#xD;
&#xD;
upon my new and beloved vocation. Lastly, I placed a&#xD;
chair before the table, and seated myself in it, to see how ~t&#xD;
would seem when I began to draw in the morning.&#xD;
"That will do," said Grace laughing.' "Come and sew&#xD;
now."&#xD;
We sewed, and conversed upon the prospects of the fam-&#xD;
ily until dinner-time. When we descended to that meal,&#xD;
Mr. Cardover was still closeted with Mr. Rodman in the&#xD;
parlor. Cousin Mary cast occasional anxious glances to-&#xD;
wards the door. After Mr. Bedell and Walter had gone,&#xD;
she said, "John learned this morning that his losses ~re less&#xD;
than lie supposed; he hopes to get through his difficulties&#xD;
without a failure."&#xD;
"Will he?" Grace and I asked, eagerly.&#xD;
"No, he cannot," said Cousin 1~Jary, decidedly. "It&#xD;
will merely be vexation of spirit for him to put off the evil&#xD;
day. I know that Mr. Cardover will advise him rightly, but&#xD;
I fear John will not ~take the advice."&#xD;
At night Grace told me the substance of Mr. Cardover's&#xD;
business with Mr. 1{odman. He proposed advancing funds&#xD;
- for James to buy Cousin John out. Then he spoke of a 111-&#xD;
crative situation which Mr. Rodman might take as bookkeep-&#xD;
er in a large mercantile house. The proposition was rejected&#xD;
- with many thanks; the unfortunate man thought he saw a&#xD;
way through his troubles.&#xD;
"What do you suppose he asked me?" said Grace,&#xD;
looking very wretched.&#xD;
"I don't know.~~&#xD;
"He asked me for my little pittance as a loan: my thou-&#xD;
sand dollars."&#xD;
"Oh! ~what did you do?"&#xD;
"I refused it!" Grace covered her face with her&#xD;
hands, and wept. "It was such a trial,' Kate; but Mary&#xD;
* had told me hut a short time before not to let him have i&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8254-00000031"/>&#xD;
60                  ALL IS GONTh                                                     HARSH wonds.                  61&#xD;
&#xD;
She said it could do him no good, and it might be all we&#xD;
should have to rely upon: I spoke of his taking it 'when she&#xD;
tir~t told me of his troubles. It cut me to the heart so, to&#xD;
see Joihn's look of surprise and pain. I told him I feared&#xD;
the family might need 'it.&#xD;
"'You might rely upon me to look after my family!' he&#xD;
said very bitterly.&#xD;
0 forgive me, John,' I said; 'it is not selfishness that&#xD;
makes me keep it from you !'&#xD;
"He turned angrily away and left the room. I shall&#xD;
dread to meet him now. Mr. Bedell told Mary he wished&#xD;
she would advise her husband riot to attempt to get through;&#xD;
it would be far better for him to stop short at once."&#xD;
I dreaded an accession to1 Mr. IR&amp;amp;dman's gloom. The&#xD;
next morning he treated Grace with a frigidity of demeanor&#xD;
that sent the painful color from her heart to her face, and&#xD;
back again. At dinner it was the same; a sort of savage&#xD;
spirit ~seemed to have taken possession of' him, a dark despair&#xD;
'against which he madly yet vainly fought: he glanced at us&#xD;
like a lion at bay. If we spoke cheerfully, we instantly felt&#xD;
as if he regarded it as treason; if we were silent and grave,&#xD;
it irritated him. Thus weeks passed in a miserable con-&#xD;
straint under his presence; our warm hopes of cheering him,&#xD;
by showing him that his home should be a refuge from strife,&#xD;
failed. We could not please him; our only effort was not to&#xD;
offend him.&#xD;
One~ morning, as I entered the dining-room, I heard&#xD;
Cousin John exclaim, in an excited tone, "Every thing is&#xD;
gone now!" He was pacing up and down: he struck 'his&#xD;
forehead with his hand, groaning, "0 God, it is too much !"&#xD;
His wife was weeping: she could not comfort him; she&#xD;
could not brighten the darkness by her, devotion. Woman&#xD;
holiest compensation was taken from hei.; she must suffer,&#xD;
and not lessen her anguish by soothing his.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Let us have breakfast!" said Cousin John abruptly, as&#xD;
he saw me~ Cousin Mary went to her room to conceal her&#xD;
red eyes; I took up a paper to wait for her. Mr. Rodman&#xD;
asked, "Are the children ready?"&#xD;
"They are, I believe," I answered.&#xD;
"Is Grace ready? James and Walter are waiting."&#xD;
Grace entered at the instant.&#xD;
"Ring the bell for the breakfast to be brought in," he&#xD;
pursued. "We will not wait for Mrs. Rodman." The&#xD;
meal passed in constrained silence: Walter and James ate as&#xD;
speedily as possible, and went away; so did. the children.&#xD;
Mr. liodman finished, and went to his wife's room for his hat.&#xD;
As he was coming out, she hastened to the door and said,&#xD;
gently,&#xD;
"John, I must +speak with you one monwnt about&#xD;
he shut the door almost directly in her face, and stalked out&#xD;
of the house without 'a word. Grace's eyes flashed lightning;&#xD;
then she murmured, "0 Mary, Mary! poor sister!" and&#xD;
burst into a passion of pitying tears. After a moment she&#xD;
looked up, and said, "He deserves his misfortune: he tram~&#xD;
ples upon her loving heart as if it were the dust of the&#xD;
ground: he thinks it a light crime to murder all her inno-&#xD;
cent peace. He has long desolated her life. Kate! some-&#xD;
times it seems as if my heart would burst, when I hear him&#xD;
speak to her as he does always harshly and coldly. She was&#xD;
so lovingly n~ittured. Once I besought 'him with torrents&#xD;
of tears to speak more gently to her: I told him he was&#xD;
'killing her with hard and careless words. And I think he&#xD;
was more thoughtful after that."&#xD;
"I suppose he does not at all realize the amount of 'suf-&#xD;
fering he inflicts," I said.&#xD;
"I suppose not," returned Grace, sighing; "we must&#xD;
bear with him. The angels count the good in human hearts,&#xD;
and tryto overlook the evil. Let us hope yet for him."&#xD;
&#xD;
60&#xD;
&#xD;
ALL IS GONE&#xD;

UNPLEASANT SENSATIoNS.            03&#xD;
&#xD;
62             WHAT SHALL 13E DONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cousin Mary c~ame from her room; her eyes were swollen&#xD;
with weeping, and her face was pale, but from her calm look&#xD;
we knew4hat she had been to Him who gives rest to the&#xD;
weary and heavy laden. A new strength shone froh her&#xD;
countenance. She sat down beside us.&#xD;
"Will you have some coffee, dear?" asked Grace, pour-&#xD;
ing out a cup: her lips quivered as she did so.&#xD;
Cousin Mary only shook her head in the negative: she&#xD;
dared not tirnst her eyes t~ meet those of Grace, or her calm-&#xD;
ness would have been overcome. "The end has come at&#xD;
last," she said, speaking hastily. "We are worse than&#xD;
nothing. His house is sold. John has giveu up every thing.&#xD;
He is a beggar this morning. It would not be very hard to&#xD;
bear if others would not lose by him."&#xD;
"Shall we move!?" asked Grace.&#xD;
~' No; Mr. Waldron has bought the house; he does not&#xD;
wish to use it. He resides out of the city in the summer."&#xD;
"How shall we live?" asked Grace. "What will&#xD;
John do!"&#xD;
"It will. take him some time to settle up his business.&#xD;
Walter and James propose still boarding with us. Then&#xD;
Kate we have. Ii shall help you with your sewing, Grace,&#xD;
and perhaps I can earn a little in that way. I shall send&#xD;
poor Sally away this morning, and little John also. The&#xD;
children must work more than they have ever done before."&#xD;
"It will be an exce1le~t thing for them!" said Grace.&#xD;
"We must teach them to sew with us sometimes, too. We&#xD;
can tell them 'stories to beguile the tediousnpss of labor.&#xD;
We shall get along nicely, if we retain our health. Keep up&#xD;
a strong heart, Mary, and lean upon Kate and me. We will&#xD;
all exercise about the house, and then sit down to our seden-&#xD;
tary labor together. I dare say we shall enjoy our new way&#xD;
of living very much. We shall have the consolation of&#xD;
knowing' that we are useful. We shall love each other bet-&#xD;
&#xD;
ter if we share our cares, and interests, and hopes together,&#xD;
won't we Kate?" And she took my hand and laid it with&#xD;
her own upon the hand of Cousin Mary.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed! " I returned. We kissed each other&#xD;
fervently, and a threefold cord bound u~ together. It was&#xD;
very consoling to me to see that Grace and Cousin Mary re-&#xD;
garded me as tne of them in their trouble; they compre-&#xD;
hended how I felt: how precious it was to me to be closely&#xD;
linked with home]'; its cares were sweet compared with isola-&#xD;
tion. Now t1~at we had absolutely reached the bottom of the&#xD;
hill, and could find out our true position and duties, we&#xD;
began to feel strong and courageous. It was like a breath&#xD;
of healing both 'to Grace and myself, to cheer in a thou-&#xD;
sand little ways Cousin Mary in her thorny path. Yet&#xD;
oftentimes the change. in the family circumstances came to&#xD;
our consciousness with a very unpleasant sensation. Sally&#xD;
had 'been a host in herself; she had a peculiar way of doing&#xD;
work, so that it seemed as if it was the easiest thing in the&#xD;
world: she never burned any thing, and always had every&#xD;
thing ready at the same moment. For a week or two after&#xD;
she left Cousin Mary, Grace and I labored incredibly at din-&#xD;
ner time to do as Well as ~he did, bnt we seated ourselves~&#xD;
at the table, with very red faces, and with a total lack of re-&#xD;
pose of manner. When Gertrude went to the kitchen to&#xD;
wash the dishes, the fire had unaccountably gone out, and&#xD;
the dish-water was not on. Gradually, however, order and&#xD;
system were introduced; 'we had fewer pl~ns to discuss, and&#xD;
practice rendered us swift and efficient. We at last began to,&#xD;
wonder how we could have been satisfied with some of&#xD;
Sally's careless ways.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE house was very quiet. Cousin' Mary and Grace had&#xD;
gone out with the 'children, and IL sat alone, painting,.-and&#xD;
thinking. My thoughts reverted with a painful tenacity to&#xD;
the evening before; although with a bitter and disdainful&#xD;
effort IL had wrenched them from the subject more than once,&#xD;
'still with a fresh pang the scene of the evening before struck&#xD;
my remembrance. It was a very simple scene. Mr~ Car-&#xD;
dover stood by Judith Nlortou's chair and leaned over, speak-&#xD;
ing to her with eager, suppressed pleasure: I felt that she&#xD;
was enchantingly lovely to him. I had never thought or&#xD;
dreamed of him except as a very kind friend; yet as IL&#xD;
looked at them, a new and powerful influence swept through&#xD;
my soul; if I had been alone IL could have wept with a wild&#xD;
sense of bereavement. IL had not seen them together for&#xD;
many weeks. IL had imagined that Judith appeared to him,&#xD;
as she had for a long time appeared to our family, stripped of&#xD;
her fascinations. IL had scarcely thought of them in connec-&#xD;
tion of late. Since our misfortune, Mr. Cardover and his&#xD;
sister had visited' us a great deal: the former had lent me&#xD;
many delightful and useful books' to read. lie had seemed&#xD;
kindly interested in n~iy improvement. One evening when&#xD;
he came in, IL was reading a very fascinating hut useless&#xD;
romance. He looked ~t it, then suddenly closing it with a&#xD;
smile, he said, "ILs it a good plan to read this, sister Kate?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I won't finish it ! " IL replied, and from that mcunent he&#xD;
had seemed to me like an elder brother. One memory after&#xD;
another stole upon me as IL sat at work,: IL was so unspeaka-&#xD;
bly lonely. It had never before seemed difficult to live with-&#xD;
out being an object of supreme affection to some one; but&#xD;
now how dreary the prospect! The passionate tears dropped&#xD;
heavily upon my picture. All these new miserable thoughts&#xD;
rushed upon me in a flood. IL pushed back my chair and&#xD;
wept in utter abandonment, "These are the first and last&#xD;
tears!" IL murmured: their flow eased the aching at my&#xD;
heart: then IL sunk upon my knees in prayer: the intensity&#xD;
of my supplication brought a sweet sensation of peace: for&#xD;
the first time in my life the curtain seemed lifted from des-&#xD;
tiny, and IL realized that suffering was for the sake of bring-&#xD;
ing infinite good to the soul. All things seemed changed to&#xD;
me: IL saw that it was selfisl~ in me to be refining over my&#xD;
lot, instead of blessing God that IL could brighten the lot of&#xD;
others. So IL went to work again, tranquilly, sadly, re-&#xD;
signedly: there was a weary hush in my ~pirit after its late&#xD;
agitation. An hour glided on, then IL heard some one pacing&#xD;
up and down below stairs: Ii went to the banister, and&#xD;
listened: it was not Mr. IRodman's step, and IL went down.&#xD;
I opened the parlor door: it was Walter; his cheeks were in&#xD;
a fla~ne. IL was about retiring, when he looked at me with&#xD;
a more observant glance than at first. Perhaps he suspected&#xD;
I' had been weeping, for he said very gently,&#xD;
"Will you come in, Kate?"&#xD;
"Do you want me?" IL inquired, seeing an expression&#xD;
of anguish in his face. "Can IL help you, Walter?"&#xD;
He merely motioned with his hand for me to enter. I&#xD;
did so, closing the door after me. He sat down in a chair,&#xD;
covered his face with both hands a moment, then, with a&#xD;
calmness II could not bear to see, he whispered, "Kate,' I am&#xD;
very miserable."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8254-00000034"/>&#xD;
66                   A I~EJECTI0N.                                                  MUSIC'S IN~LTJENCE.              67&#xD;
&#xD;
His tone touchedthe chord so lately vibrating in my own&#xD;
heart. "Why?" I asked, and I laid my hand on his shoul-&#xD;
der: I was not in a mood to retain my composure, and the&#xD;
too ready tear~ began to fall.&#xD;
"Judith has rejected me!" he responded in an accent of&#xD;
deepest pain. "I loved her so well, Kate, so faithfully: it&#xD;
was without measure. I poured out all the wealth of my&#xD;
heart upon her. But now the golden bowl is broken: my&#xD;
youth "- a sudden gush of tears came to his relief: we&#xD;
both wept very, very hard. At length he said, " There was&#xD;
such a dreadful strain upon my heart, I think it ~would have&#xD;
burst, without these tears. I was thinking of self-murder&#xD;
when you came in, Kate; II was wishing it was not sinful."&#xD;
"Oh, Walter! think how much good you may yet do:&#xD;
think that many may yet heap upon your head the blessings&#xD;
of those ready to perish."&#xD;
"No-no!" he said slowly ; "I am like one shipwrecked:&#xD;
every thing is gone, ~1ope, zeal, trust; only a wretched cow-&#xD;
ardice is left: I shudder to walk the path of life myself how&#xD;
then can I help others?"&#xD;
" You will not always feel as you do now: you may love&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Never!" he quickly answered; "such mad worship&#xD;
comes but once; such wild idolatry. I thought she surely&#xD;
loved me; I thought I read it in her smiles, in h~i~ eyes, in&#xD;
her voice; and yet the stroke of fear fell upon my spirit&#xD;
whenever I thought of asking her to be my wife. I did to-&#xD;
day! She said never dreamed that I entertained&#xD;
such sentiments towards her."&#xD;
"That was a falsehood!" I slid, with an inward glow&#xD;
of anger. "She is not worthy of you, Walter. It is better&#xD;
for you that your destiny is nol bound up with hers: she&#xD;
would have made you unhappy.&#xD;
"Oh, no! happy, happy! happier than I shall ever~ be&#xD;
again."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Perhaps you will some time meet some gentle angel just&#xD;
suited to pour consolation into the wounds. of your heart;&#xD;
one who will exalt your whole nature. Judith would have&#xD;
dragged you downward."&#xD;
"You do not understand her, Kate! "&#xD;
*     "Well, dear Walter, then I will not speak of her. I&#xD;
will oLily hope that your heart will turn to one who is never&#xD;
deaf to the pangs and wants of our spirits." For a long&#xD;
time Walter was silent. Then he arose and took his flute;&#xD;
he poured forth the saddest strains that ever came from a&#xD;
despairing heart. Lilly Cardover, who had come to visit the&#xD;
children, softly opened the door and stoIc into the room: she&#xD;
looked at Walter with a sorrowful expression in her great&#xD;
eyes; she advanced to where he sat, and dropped on a cricket&#xD;
at his feet, still gazing, still listening to the strain. She saw&#xD;
how sad we both looked, and a lovely sympathy overspread&#xD;
her countenance. When he paused, she said, pleadingly,&#xD;
"Not such music, if you please; it makes my heart ache!"&#xD;
"Not such!" answered Walter, looking in her tender&#xD;
countenance; "not such, darling child?" He bent over and&#xD;
kissed her beautiful eyes,. her soft lips; then he played more&#xD;
cheerful airs. while Lilly leaned her head against his knee&#xD;
and listened quietly.&#xD;
Day after day Walter's pale, miserable face appeared at&#xD;
tablc~ but he did not seem disposed to enter into conversa-&#xD;
tion with any one. He seemed to be brooding upon one&#xD;
thought only. Grace seemed as cheerful as of~ yore. Mr.&#xD;
Benzoni did not call quite as frequently as formerIy,~but he&#xD;
was often absent from the city on business. He did not ask&#xD;
us to go into Judith's any more, 1~or did she come into our&#xD;
house as often as formerly; he seemed to have lost his in-&#xD;
terest in her, and Grace was deeply relieved. I think it was&#xD;
gratitude for her delivery from the suspicion that he was&#xD;
interested in Judth that made her cheerful, even although&#xD;

A SLEIGHl-RIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
his manners had not quite the tenderness of old; she was&#xD;
strong in the hope of winning back old times.&#xD;
One afternoon when the sun shone gloriously upon the&#xD;
glittering snow, I sallied out with a little roll of paintings to&#xD;
Mr. Cardover's store. 'When I reached it he was just step-&#xD;
ping into a sleigh.&#xD;
"You are just in time, Kate!" he said, with his bright&#xD;
smile, stepping out; again on the sidewalk. "I was just go-&#xD;
ing to drive to the stable. Now I shall have the pleasure&#xD;
takingyou home."&#xD;
"Thank you. Isn't it a magnificent day?" I returned.&#xD;
We entered the store; he looked at my pictures, commented&#xD;
upon them very freely, and commended the care I had taken&#xD;
with them. He then handed down a very beautiful oil&#xD;
painting for me to copy; it was a small picture, and we&#xD;
stowed it away in the sleigh~ After wrapping up in buffalo&#xD;
~robes we started.&#xD;
"Have you been sleigh-riding before this winter, Kate?"&#xD;
he asked.&#xD;
"No! IL have not."&#xD;
"Then we will drive out of the city a little distance, if&#xD;
it would be agreeable to you,"&#xD;
"I should like it," I said, for the bracing air and rapid&#xD;
motion was exhilarating.&#xD;
"What is the matter with Walter lately ?" inquired Mr.&#xD;
Cardover; "he looks so wretched and haggard!"&#xD;
"He is not very well, I believe," I answered.&#xD;
"And very low-spirited?" pursued Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"Yes, he seems to be."&#xD;
"Does he attend to his music?"&#xD;
"Oh yes! Sometimes he plays on the organ in the church&#xD;
until twelve o'clock at night; and half the time without any&#xD;
fire. Grace and I go to the church sometimes. Grace likes&#xD;
to play on that organ."&#xD;
&#xD;
A COQUETTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
69&#xD;
&#xD;
"Walter's business affairs do not trouble him?"&#xD;
"Oh, I think not."&#xD;
"His dress is very careless. He looks as if he had not&#xD;
shaved in a month!"&#xD;
I saw that Mr. Cardover was determined to ascertain the&#xD;
cause of Walter's miserable mental condition, so I said,&#xD;
"He had previously taken unusual pains with his dress;&#xD;
II suppose you know what that indicates."&#xD;
"No! What?"&#xD;
"Young gentlemen express the tender passion by new&#xD;
vests and cravats. He has thrown his embroidered cravats&#xD;
away 1"&#xD;
"He has been disappointed?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir.&#xD;
"By Miss Morton?"&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
Mr. Cardover was silent some moments, then he said,&#xD;
"I have heard Miss Morton called a coquette."&#xD;
"Ah!" then I added, "How white the snow is in the&#xD;
centre of the road, compared with what it is in the city."&#xD;
"Yes, very. I never thought she was," he continued,&#xD;
as if I had not tried to turn the conversation.&#xD;
"Was what?' I asked a little maliciously.&#xD;
"I never thought Miss Morton was a coquette," he re-&#xD;
turned, with a slightly embarrassed manner. "She obeys&#xD;
the impulse of the moment, and is kind, perhaps, when her&#xD;
kindness is dangerous. I never supposed she was attached&#xD;
to Walter."&#xD;
"No, I did not."&#xD;
"You did not? Are you intimate with her?" and he&#xD;
glanced at me eagerly.&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Is Grace?"&#xD;
"No, sir,"&#xD;

THE ANXIOUS SUSPENSE.             71&#xD;
&#xD;
70              TUE WHITE ~ONNET.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I supposed you were together a great deal."&#xD;
"No! She used to come in to see us more frequently&#xD;
than she does now."&#xD;
"Do you ~o to see her as much as you used to?"&#xD;
7~&#xD;
"No, sir.&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
"I don't like her!" I spoke with an emphasis I re-&#xD;
gretted, for Mr. Cardover looked at me as if I was less&#xD;
amiable than he had imagined.&#xD;
"Is it right for you to indulge such feelings ? " he gravely&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"I suppose not," I answered, and I felt that the color&#xD;
had leaped into my cheek; the old pang awoke in my heart;&#xD;
I had believed it was gone for ever.&#xD;
"Why do you dislike her, Kate?" he asked more mildly.&#xD;
"Because I cannot help it."&#xD;
"Others see in her a great deal to admire and love!"&#xD;
"I know many do admire her and love her."&#xD;
"She seems to me to possess a heavenliness of character,&#xD;
if I may coin a word, that I have never seen in any one&#xD;
else: she has an impromptu grace, a naturalness that is irre-&#xD;
sistible she always speaks so gently to her parents, to her&#xD;
brother; it betrays a delicate and loving nature. I am sure&#xD;
a most noble heart lies beneath her mirthful manner.~~&#xD;
Alas! lovers always think alike. I had long since&#xD;
learned from casual remarks dropped by Frank Morton, that&#xD;
Judith did not study the happiness of her family; but I re-&#xD;
mained silent, for I thought my remarks would be attributed&#xD;
to prejudice. At this moment we turned around. Mr. Car-&#xD;
dover's attention was directed to the horses: A sleigh passed&#xD;
us, holding a lady and gentleman. I had but a glimpse of&#xD;
them; they looked strangely like Mr. ]3enzoni and Judith.&#xD;
I turned around very eagerly; I could not be certain, for&#xD;
twilight was gathering around us, but the white bonnet and&#xD;
&#xD;
waving plume were like Miss Morton's. What could it&#xD;
mean? Had my excited imagination deceived me? The&#xD;
crescent moon was rising in the deeply blue sky; the great&#xD;
leafless trees lifted their giant forms above the snowy ground,&#xD;
and pointed to the star-lighted firmament. N~Still sounded&#xD;
the softly jingling bells; still we vent on with a swift glid..&#xD;
ing motion; on we went, until we ~cached home, and still I&#xD;
was in a maze.&#xD;
When I saw Grace awaiting Mr. Benzoni in the parlor,&#xD;
I looked at her with deep pity. It was two weeks since he&#xD;
had been to see her; she supposed he had been absent from&#xD;
the city. Had he? Ii feared a dreadful truth was to burst&#xD;
upon her. After tea I hastened to our chamber, and sat&#xD;
pondering the subject. I could not approach her with a&#xD;
surmise, and yet in my heart there grew a faith as powerful&#xD;
as knowledge could have been, that she was forsaken. Storm&#xD;
after storm caine beating upon the household hearts; most&#xD;
terrible of all was this last storm upon the head of Grace.&#xD;
The quiet night hours passed on, and still she kept her&#xD;
watch. When the city clocks struck twelve, I. heard her&#xD;
ascending the stairs. I seized a book, and bent over it. I&#xD;
was still wondering whether I had best tell her my fears;&#xD;
but the patient sadness on her face as she opened the door&#xD;
took away all courage.&#xD;
"I thought Giovanni would certainly be here to-night,"&#xD;
she said. "I wish he was not obliged to go out of the city&#xD;
so often."&#xD;
"You must remember business comes. before love with&#xD;
gentlemen, Grace. It happens so after the novelty has gone&#xD;
by."&#xD;
An expression of pain passed over her countenance. I&#xD;
did not speak heartlessly; I wished she might learn to look&#xD;
for less affection from him.&#xD;
"Divide your heart a little more with us, Grace. I love&#xD;
&#xD;

72                 KIND RESOLVES.&#xD;
&#xD;
you beyond all power of words to tell!" and I put my arms&#xD;
around, her, and kissed her trembling lips.&#xD;
"Do you, dear Kate ?" 'she asked in a soothed voice&#xD;
She laid her face on my shoulder, and wept ~very quietly.&#xD;
~' Oh," she murmured, "I wish I were not so exacting; I&#xD;
wish I were not always hungering for affection ; I used to&#xD;
feel at rest when he first loved me, Kate. During this last&#xD;
week it has seemed every night more than I could bear, that&#xD;
he did not come but I suppose he cannot."&#xD;
"Think of poor Walter!" I said. "You ought to think&#xD;
of cheering him. To-morrow let us resolve to break the&#xD;
gloor~i on his face ; he has mourned long enough now."&#xD;
"I have scarcely thought of amusing him," said Grace.&#xD;
"Then let us begin to-morrow, and see if we cannot suc-&#xD;
ceed better than we did with Cousin John."&#xD;
"Well," she replied.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
TILE next morning Mr. Rodman was prostrated on a bed of&#xD;
sickness; he had a very severe attack of rheumatism, and&#xD;
like most men who have enjoyed excellent health, he thought&#xD;
his sufferings greater than had ever been endured by mortal&#xD;
before. We all flew hither and thither to wait on him and&#xD;
pity gathered in our hearts as we saw his strong spirit~ chafe&#xD;
under his untoward destiny. He feared he should never re-&#xD;
cover sound health, and he looked upon the future awaiting&#xD;
the family with anxiety. Already we had broken into&#xD;
Grace's little fortune. Now began more retrenchments; we&#xD;
gave up a fire in the nursery, and 0-race and I left our large&#xD;
pleasant room, to spend our time by the dining-room fire.&#xD;
Mr. Bedell always came in with cheerful words and smiles,&#xD;
and predicted that "the fortunes of our house" should rise&#xD;
~ gain. When Walter left the dinner-table upon the first&#xD;
day of change, he gave me a very significant look. I fol-&#xD;
hwed him into the hall.&#xD;
"What is it, W~alter?"&#xD;
"Let us go into the nursery a moment," he said; ~&#xD;
shall be interrupted here."&#xD;
We did so; and 'then Walter said, "Mr. Benzoni loves&#xD;
Judith Morton. He is faithless to our Grace."&#xD;
"Oh!" I exclaimed, "dreadful!" But Walter went on&#xD;

74               A CRUEL DECEPTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
with his story: "I was walking 6ut of town, where there are&#xD;
no houses; I hardly knew where I went, and I did n6t care.&#xD;
I sat down on a pile of boards, near a new house that was&#xD;
building. After awhile I saw a gentleman walk slowly along&#xD;
the road, and pause occasionally, as if waiting for some one.&#xD;
It was Mr. Benzoni. An omnibus* soon passed, and a lady&#xD;
alighted; it was Judith. She took Mr. Beuzoni's arm, and&#xD;
they went out of sight; but I saw him clasp her hand, and&#xD;
look down in her face, as if life hung on her words; as I used&#xD;
to lo~ok, I suppose." And he laughed bitterly.&#xD;
" Oh! what shall we do?"&#xD;
"You must t.~ll Graceimmediately."&#xD;
"Perhaps she will not believe it. Why does M~. Ben-&#xD;
zoni use such deception ?"&#xD;
"Probably," returned Walter, musingly, "he will marry&#xD;
Judith before long."&#xD;
"How shall I break it to Grade?"&#xD;
"God knows!"&#xD;
"IDo you regret that cruel Judith, now, Walter?"&#xD;
"I do not regret hcr,-I regret my wasted heart; regret&#xD;
that Ii can never be so rich in hop~ and joy as before I knew&#xD;
her. I regret the vision, that has died. I would give all&#xD;
the world contains, if I owned it, to start in life with th~&#xD;
feelings I had a few months ago."&#xD;
"I think you will be happy again, some time. It is&#xD;
dreadful to lose happiness at the very outset of life; it&#xD;
seems so long before we can rest in heaven. But there is a&#xD;
heaven, Walter; keep your eye fixed on that hope; think&#xD;
that every day may bring you one day nearer to it."&#xD;
"But every day does not bring me nearer to it; some&#xD;
days I near hell."&#xD;
Oh ! Why' will you? Why not start for ~heaven in&#xD;
these miserable hours when earthly hopes have failed? Why&#xD;
not rise conqueror from this cruel battle? Why not owe&#xD;
&#xD;
eternal happiness to this blow from the hand of Judith?&#xD;
Why not extract honey from this poison-flower resting on&#xD;
your heart? Why take poison alone, and seek no good&#xD;
in it?"&#xD;
"Why, indeed? Kate, I have prayed Qf late as I never&#xD;
prayed before,-prayed for a little rest. I have cried for it&#xD;
with my whole heart. Sometimes it comes. I wish I could&#xD;
stay my soul upon God. Poor Grace! she did not need&#xD;
such suffering; why must she have it?"&#xD;
"I think her eternal future must req#iire it, or she&#xD;
would not be called upon tosuffer. 'I must go to her."&#xD;
She was in the dining-room alone. I sat down near her,&#xD;
and took up my brush to paint.&#xD;
"Grace," I said, after collecting my thoughts, and my&#xD;
voice trembled, "do you think that you and Mr. B~nzoni are&#xD;
suited to each other? "&#xD;
~he looked at me with a timorous gaze; her heart took&#xD;
ahirm. "Why are we not suited to each other?"&#xD;
"You are devoted to heavenly things, and he to earthly~&#xD;
things! Ii have thought sometimes that one might suppose&#xD;
him an atheist, from his conversation."&#xD;
"Oh,. no! Kate; how could you ever have drawn such&#xD;
inferences ?"&#xD;
"Jie said one day that he acknowledged no God but his&#xD;
owh will."&#xD;
"lit was a careless way of speaking; I do not think he&#xD;
thought so in his secret heart. Perhaps II may, under God,&#xD;
be the means of making him a Christian. Would not that&#xD;
be worth every thing?"&#xD;
"Yes; if it could be so. But he might make you like&#xD;
himself, very worldly. You know, Grace, that you catch the&#xD;
influence of others' feelings very easily."&#xD;
"I know it! but God is strong enough to shield me in&#xD;
the path of duty."&#xD;

TRUE LOVE.                                                THE FAITHLESS LOVER.              77&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you and Mr. Benzoni are not really congenial, do you&#xD;
think it would be your duty to marry him?"&#xD;
"Yes! I think it is right that I should give my hand&#xD;
with my heart,-my whole life will be a prayer for his&#xD;
highest good. Why should I not be his wife? We are con-&#xD;
genial."&#xD;
"No, dear Grace, you are not."&#xD;
"Oh! Kate, please never speak to me of this. II know&#xD;
you mean very kindly by me; but you cannot change me, and&#xD;
it makes me 59 wretched to hear you. If it were not sinful,&#xD;
I Would sooner go to hell with Mr. Benzoni than to heaven&#xD;
without him."&#xD;
She covered her face with her hands, and the tears rolled&#xD;
down between her fingers. "No!" she said, "I have never&#xD;
seen any great duty yet, that I could not force myself to&#xD;
perform; I could go to the stake and beburned, I know I&#xD;
could; that would be easy. God could nOt require of me&#xD;
what I could not perform."&#xD;
"Darling, you must give Mr. Beuzoni up: it is your&#xD;
duty."&#xD;
"Kate! what do you mean?"&#xD;
"He does not love you, Grace! he is unworthy of you!"&#xD;
She looked at me with a smile; a smile more dreadful&#xD;
than the wildest weeping; it parted her white rigid lips with&#xD;
derision, then it passed rapidly away: a fear of the truth had&#xD;
stayed th~ blood at her heart. "How do you know that he&#xD;
does not love mc?" she asked, whisperingly.&#xD;
"I think he. loves Judith Morton!"&#xD;
"Oh, intolerable!" she groaned, and she buried her face&#xD;
in her hands upon her work-table. Cousin Mary came in&#xD;
crc long; Grace arose and went up stairs. After the lapse&#xD;
of an hour I followed her. She lay prone upon the carpet.&#xD;
"Grace! Grace!" I entreated, smoothing her hair, which&#xD;
bad fallen down.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't speak to me!" she returned; "I am God-for-&#xD;
saken!"&#xD;
"You will take your death-cold here!" I continued.&#xD;
"I hope Imay!"&#xD;
"Oh, Grace, have you forgotten poor Mary and all her&#xD;
cares? There never was a time when your life was so&#xD;
needed in the family as now. Do not give way now."&#xD;
She slowly arose; her eyes were dry and tearless; one&#xD;
would scarcely have believed that devouring anguish was&#xD;
preying upon her heart, she was so calm. She mechanically&#xD;
arranged her beautiful hair, and then followed me down&#xD;
stairs. All the afternoon she sewed quietly; but she re-&#xD;
sponded to our questions with a quick, almost sharp impa-&#xD;
tience. At evening, when we went to our room, she said,&#xD;
"Kate, tell me about it. Has he communicated with you?&#xD;
Has he sent me any message ?"&#xD;
"No," I said; "Walter saw him niect Judith out of&#xD;
town!"&#xD;
"Then I do not believe he is faithless to me; Walter&#xD;
was mistaken. How ofte~ii do we mistake people. Giovanni&#xD;
is not capable of such bas~ deception; lie is the soul of frank-&#xD;
n~. I have felt upon consideration this afternoon, that it&#xD;
was not in keeping with his character to wilfully deceive me.&#xD;
I acknowledge that lie did at one time seem pleased with&#xD;
Judith, but he has seemed more than indifferent when we&#xD;
have met her of late. Ii am sure he has discovered her&#xD;
character, and that he does not esteem her more than we do."&#xD;
"But, Grace, the other day, when I was riding with Mr.&#xD;
Cardover, I thought I saw them in a sleigh together."&#xD;
She pressed her lips together, as if a mortal pang had /&#xD;
seized her. I began to unbind my hair, but she still stood&#xD;
motionless in the middle of the floor. "Are you sure it was&#xD;
Giovanni and Judith you saw?" she at length asked, lifting&#xD;
up her large eyes, and riveting them upon inc.&#xD;

"I am not certain, but I think so."&#xD;
"Kate, how could you kill me with mere suspicion!&#xD;
How natural a thing it would be, in a city like this, for two&#xD;
persons to bear some resemblance to them. I see no reason-&#xD;
able foundation for the agony you have caused ilie: it is&#xD;
cruelly unjust to Mr. Benzoni. He will be here to-night,&#xD;
and in the morning T shall satisfy you that you have not&#xD;
judged him kindly."&#xD;
"And you intend to let him deceive you longer?" I&#xD;
wa~ excited, and did not speak as gently as I should have&#xD;
done to such a broken heart. She only gave me a look that&#xD;
said, "Forbear!"&#xD;
"Grace !" Ii besought, "break your engagement at once!&#xD;
to-night, if he domes. Do not let him cast you off when he&#xD;
chooses. I know what the end will be. You will never&#xD;
marry him. Walter was not deceived: he was certain, if I&#xD;
am not. Even if you believe Mr. Benzoni true to you,&#xD;
break off with him. He believes that all men are actuated&#xD;
by selfishness! Beware of 'the cold heart that fosters a ser~&#xD;
pent like this; it would sting you to death. It is in vain for&#xD;
you to dream there is any suitability between you; there is&#xD;
not. You are worshipping a cre~ition of your yearning&#xD;
heart. He can never be to you what youcrave; he is dust&#xD;
and ashes, nay more, he would poison your inner being, if&#xD;
you clung to him; he is a godless man-an atheist-lie&#xD;
would retard your eternal progress. Rouse up your courage!&#xD;
resign him now! Do not cling to an estranged heart; dismiss&#xD;
him: let pride come to your aid!"&#xD;
"Ii have no pride!" and around her mouth the blue&#xD;
paleness of 'anguish~ settled~ Suddenly we heard his well-&#xD;
known rap. It was late in the evening. One feeling over-&#xD;
mastered others. I could not bear that he should cast away&#xD;
our noble Grace; the poor satisfaction of first giving him up,&#xD;
my haughty instincts craved for her. She leaned against the&#xD;
&#xD;
foot of the bed, a picture of despair. J felt that her tortured&#xD;
spirit could not respond to pride indeed. She looked at me&#xD;
and uttered, "Oh, Kate!" in a tone of exquisite suffering.&#xD;
"God will support you! Ministering angels will bring&#xD;
you strength if you allow nothing to stand between you and&#xD;
heaven. Give him up now!"&#xD;
She bowed her face upon the foot of the bed in a still&#xD;
silence. Perchance she prayed; then ~he left nie. After&#xD;
~he had gone, I realized how every word I had uttered had&#xD;
stabbed her to the heart, and a portion of her misery pos-&#xD;
sessed me. I hastily undressed, and sought forgetfulness in&#xD;
sleep; the wintry moon shone into the chamber, strong,&#xD;
clear, and calni. i[ wondered if Grace would indeed break&#xD;
her engagen~efit, or if Mr. Benzoni would first speak of it.&#xD;
I listened for a sound. I had resolved never to speak to her&#xD;
again on the subject, to let things have their way. I had&#xD;
dropped into slumber several times, .and had awakened to see&#xD;
if Grace had come up stairs yet. Again I slcpt for ii nio-&#xD;
ment. A dim lamp-light was thrown upon my face, and a&#xD;
voice said,&#xD;
"Oh, if this heart could be relieved by a moment of such&#xD;
rest "&#xD;
"Oh, Grace!" and I started from my pillow. She was&#xD;
sitting updn the bed, looking at me; she was quite calm.&#xD;
"iii have something to tell you that you will be glad to&#xD;
hear; I will put down the lamp."&#xD;
It is cold, darling. Wrap this blanket around you."&#xD;
"No; it will soon be time for me 'to get breakfast. I&#xD;
must have a duty for every moment iiow, Kate," She fell&#xD;
into thought.&#xD;
"We are pads, Kate; it is all over!"&#xD;
"Was he willing to have it broken off?"&#xD;
"I don't know. He rested his head upon my shoulder&#xD;

&#xD;
and wept like a child. Do you think now that I have&#xD;
allowed any thing to stand between me and heaven?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! Grace. God will remember your suffering."&#xD;
"It was right, Kate. He did not ask me to continue&#xD;
the engagement. I did not speak of Judith: I could not."&#xD;
"Did you say why you parted? Did he seem sur-&#xD;
prised?" I asked.&#xD;
'Yes, he did seem surprised. He colored deeply and&#xD;
said, 'Have you ceased to love me, Grace?' I said I had&#xD;
become convinced that we were not suited to each other."&#xD;
~' And did you remain talking until this time?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! he did not stay long. I have been alone in the&#xD;
parlor."&#xD;
She spoke so simply, so without any appeal to sympathy,&#xD;
it went to my heart to think of' those suffering honrs;~~ndJ&#xD;
kissed her pale cheek, with a sudden gush of tears. It did&#xD;
not move her, only she laid her head upon my shoulder and&#xD;
said, "Be my soul, my stay, for I have lost my strength."&#xD;
She did not weep. The light of morning broke into the&#xD;
chamber, but no morning light broke over her young spirit.&#xD;
She went down ~tairs; throughout the day she labored inces-&#xD;
santly, but her face was white, and her eyes dry and haggard.&#xD;
Late in the afternoon I put on my bonnet to do a little&#xD;
shopping.&#xD;
"Shall I go with you, Kate?" Grace asked, with a kind&#xD;
of imploring look in her eyes, as if she felt that she was not a&#xD;
desirable companion, and yet must go.&#xD;
"Yes, I should like to have you; but you have been&#xD;
working ~o hard, dearest," I replied.&#xD;
"I am not tired," she answered; "I want the fresh air'&#xD;
We started and accomplished our errand. Grace walked&#xD;
fast; I understood too well that she would fain lull her&#xD;
mental anguish~ by physical activity. XV heii we turned to-&#xD;
&#xD;
wards home, she said, "SJiall we walk out of town a little&#xD;
ways? Are you tired, 1~ate?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! this air is so strong and bracing." I felt that&#xD;
it was a medicine to her thus to walk under the broad, free&#xD;
heaven, and we entered the outskirts of the city. At length&#xD;
I became actually tired.&#xD;
"Let us rest here one moment," I said, poiiiting to a&#xD;
pile of hewn stones. She sat down, and I passed my arm&#xD;
around her; the faint color that had tinged her che~k slowly&#xD;
receded; she untied her bonnet, as if for air; the~ she laid&#xD;
her head upon my shoulder; her eyes slowly closed, she&#xD;
leaned upon me very heavily,.-she had fainted. Blessed&#xD;
unconsciousness! it comes when the strained heart can bear&#xD;
no more. I rubbed her temples with the snow, and her&#xD;
hands. She soon opened her eyes, and closed them again,&#xD;
weai~ily.&#xD;
"You fainted, Grace!"&#xD;
'Yes," she murmured, "it came like sleep!"&#xD;
"Are you better noiv ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am so. strong, Kate; too strong; I' shall proba-&#xD;
bly live a great while." And she smiled pitifully. II won-&#xD;
dered how we should get home. Grace insisted that she&#xD;
could walk; but we were at least a mile from the city, and I&#xD;
was confident she was not equal to the undertaking. At this&#xD;
moment I saw across the open lots an omnibus driving down&#xD;
the next street. After resting awhile we crossed over, and&#xD;
took a stage home.&#xD;
A few evenings after, Mr. Cardover and Mr. Waldron,&#xD;
who were intimate friends, came in to spend the evening.&#xD;
The latter, who had not fulfilled his first year of parochial&#xD;
duty over our church, had never before visited us socially.&#xD;
Once he came in the evening, and found Mr. Benzoni with&#xD;
Grace; after that his calls had been brief, and in the day&#xD;
time. Now I half imagined Mr. Cardover had. persuaded&#xD;
&#xD;

hOPE IS EXTIN~UI5HED.                                                       GRACE IS UNHAPPY.                 83&#xD;
&#xD;
him to come. It was with difficulty that Cousin Mary pre-&#xD;
vailed on Grace to come in the parlor at all ; she sat down&#xD;
by the window, and strove to add her share to the ~onversa-&#xD;
~tion. It turned upon' life; the better life; and I thought&#xD;
Mr. Waldron 's words penetrated Grace's soul wit'h conso-&#xD;
lation.&#xD;
'~' There is no thought so glorious," he said, "as the con-&#xD;
sideration that our lives may incessantly approach a destiny&#xD;
more and more beautiful; we can bear with faith passing&#xD;
trials, when we are assuredd that the end will not be tragical.&#xD;
Disappointments are not such really; they are lights set up&#xD;
by the way, to keep us from going down to final dis~mp-&#xD;
pointmnent."&#xD;
"We cannot always realize this," said Grace; "some-&#xD;
times clouds shut out every thing but the present."&#xD;
"True!" returned Mr. Waldron; "but the truth exists&#xD;
nevertheless; the sun beyond the clouds shines eternally."&#xD;
Mr. Cardover made some remark, and Grace looked out&#xD;
of the window; I heard a footstep passing; Grace grew&#xD;
deadly pale, and then crimson; I knew whose footstep it must&#xD;
be thus to agitate her. 12 listened intently; it was Mr.&#xD;
Morton's knocker that sounded, not ours. There was a street&#xD;
lamp directly opposite the window where Grace was sitting;&#xD;
it shone upon that side of the room, and with the lamps that&#xD;
'were burning on the mantelshelf, made it very light. She'&#xD;
rose and took another chair; after a few momeimts she mna~le&#xD;
a brave effort to join again in the conversation. I strove to&#xD;
aid, her, at the risk of seeming a little impertinent. It was&#xD;
a relief when our guests took their leave, and yet, I was glad&#xD;
they had come.&#xD;
When we sought our room, Grace said, slowly, "Hope is&#xD;
extinguished; now I must overcome. He is with Judith&#xD;
now, Kate2 Oh! God, is terrible in his strength. I can&#xD;
scarcely drink the cup pressed ~o my lips."&#xD;
&#xD;
All night she turned restlessly, sometimes moaning, sonic-&#xD;
times clasping her arms around mc, when she found I was&#xD;
awake, as if it would be death to have no human heart to&#xD;
lean upon. In the morning she said, "I am very selfish,&#xD;
Rate; you have hardly slept at all: forgive me that I lean upon&#xD;
you like a weary slave, but the spring of my life is broken.&#xD;
I will try to do better. I will not, must not sink." She&#xD;
rose, and kneeling by the bedside, abandoned herself to&#xD;
prayer. It was not in tha~t heroic 'nature to lose the' crown&#xD;
of victory. After this he~ lips were sealed for weeks; and&#xD;
oh! she was so gentle, s~ faithful in her duties, always&#xD;
selecting the most irksome for herself. Cousin John was&#xD;
slowly improving in health, but he was still miserable eAough&#xD;
t6 be very restless and irritable. She listened for his wants;&#xD;
sometimes his sharp words cut her to the heart, as the hasty'&#xD;
tear betrayed, and then she quietly allowed poor Mary to be-&#xD;
come weary in his service. It was clear that he had regarded&#xD;
Grace severely ever since she had refused tu lend him her&#xD;
money; the fact that it had been freely spent during his ill-&#xD;
ness did not appear to ameliorate his feelings. Often a look&#xD;
of sudden distress overspread Cousin Mary's countenance,&#xD;
when her husband's ~ol4 voice spoke to Grace. She felt how&#xD;
it fell upon her bruised heart, almost unable to sustain itself&#xD;
amid the deepest tenderness we could lavish upon her. One&#xD;
day, Mary said: "Grace is unhappy, John!" when she left&#xD;
the room, soon after he had carelessly responded to an offered&#xD;
kindness.&#xD;
"She deserves no pity!~~ he returned. "Why did she&#xD;
break her engagement with Benzoni for a little jealous no-&#xD;
tion? In her circumstances it was utter folly. lie is rich;&#xD;
she will never have another such offer."&#xD;
"But if he did not love her as he ought ?" suggested his&#xD;
wife.&#xD;
"Tush! nonsense! He would not have broken the&#xD;
engagement."&#xD;
&#xD;

84               WEALTH IS POVERTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think he would have done so, John. He now visits&#xD;
Judith Morton constantly."&#xD;
"He would not have done sQ, if Grace had not discarded&#xD;
him. She laid too much weight upon his fancy for Judith:&#xD;
if it had not been for her jealousy, it would have ~dl turned&#xD;
out right, and Grace might have been the wifd of one of the&#xD;
richest men in the city.~~&#xD;
"Wealth is poverty, compared with affection!" said Mrs.&#xD;
liodman.&#xD;
"Women always reason in this silly way," answered&#xD;
Cousin John impatiently; "I should think, by this time,&#xD;
experience should teach you that money is important to the&#xD;
enjo5Tmdnt of life."&#xD;
" That I do believe," answered Cousin Mary; "but&#xD;
money will not compensate for a nobler dower."&#xD;
Mr. Rodman threw his handkerchief over his face, and.&#xD;
settled himself in his arm-chair for a nap.&#xD;
&#xD;
ChAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
"SHALL you go to the party to-night, Grace? '~ I asked a&#xD;
little anxiously. We had been invited to Miss Cardover's.&#xD;
"Perhaps I had better stay with John," Grace returned,&#xD;
looking at Mary.&#xD;
"Would you prefer staying at home, 0-race ?" Mary in-&#xD;
quired, fixing her tender, penetrating gaze upon her sister.&#xD;
"I would," was the simple response.&#xD;
"Then I will go," returned Nrs. Rodman. I thought&#xD;
during the day her step was lighter, for the prospect of a&#xD;
change in the evening. It was so long that Cousin Mary&#xD;
had been confined to her monotonous duties, I fancied she&#xD;
often yearned for an hour away from home. Mr. Rodman&#xD;
always imagined every tliing went wrong with him if his wif~&#xD;
was absent, and therefore she remained with him; ~he was&#xD;
in fact one of the best of nurses,&#xD;
When the afternoon shadows began to lengthen, Cousin&#xD;
Mary and I sat down to prepare a little for the party. She&#xD;
was mending a pair of white kid gloves, and I was rejuvena-&#xD;
ting a blue barge dress. We talked in whispers about our&#xD;
toilet, for we had a hidden fancy that Mr. Rodman would&#xD;
esteem it extremely silly in us to give a moment's thought&#xD;
to our appearance.&#xD;
"See there, Mary," I said, stealthily showing her some&#xD;
&#xD;

86                A NOBLE nESOLVE.                                                         GOOD LOOKS.                  87&#xD;
&#xD;
flowers I had arranged for her hair. I held them up behind&#xD;
Mr. iRodman's chair; he was sitting by the fire as usual.&#xD;
" Oh, those are perfeQtly lovely!" exclaimed Cousin&#xD;
Mary; "but won't flowers be too gay for me?"&#xD;
"No, not at all. What's the use of your imagining,&#xD;
yourself so unspeakably ancient? Only thirty-three, and&#xD;
these' are only white buds and green leaves; what could be&#xD;
more modest? Will you wear them?"&#xD;
"Yes," she smilingly replied.&#xD;
"Wear what? Are you going out to-night, Mary?"&#xD;
inquired her husband, abruptly turning around, and letting&#xD;
his glance fall upon the white gloves that lay in her lap.&#xD;
"I had concluded to go to the party, John," she replied,&#xD;
as a shadow came over her countenance.&#xD;
"Very well!" he shortly answered, wheelingg round to&#xD;
the fire again. The bright blood flashed into Mrs. IRod-&#xD;
man's cheek, and her lips momently met, as if with determi-&#xD;
nation. Once before I had seen a sudden expression upon&#xD;
her countenance, that led me to thInk she would allow her&#xD;
husband's authority to go "thus far, and no farther." There&#xD;
had never been any thing craven in her obedience and pa-&#xD;
tient gentleness. II judged that it sprung from a strong and&#xD;
noble resolve, and that she would also be capable of undying&#xD;
opposition to him, should he desire her to do that which she&#xD;
might esteem wrong. I often wondered if the old, romantic&#xD;
love still burned in her heart. How could it remain with ao&#xD;
little to live on?&#xD;
She rose with a disappointed but quiet face; the flush of&#xD;
anger had subsided under holier thoughts~ For ten minutes&#xD;
she had silently pondered, as she toyed with her gloves.&#xD;
"I will stay at home, John," she said briefly, yet in her&#xD;
gentle, half queenly way, as she took up the sewing she had&#xD;
laid aside for the day.&#xD;
"I thought you'd come to your senses!" he returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
Again the crimson rose in her cheek; it flooded her&#xD;
whole face with indignation, that he comprehended her so&#xD;
little; that he had no kindly word for her little sacrifice.&#xD;
Illness had made Mr. IRodman very selfish. I could hardly&#xD;
bear to have Cousin Mary stay at home, for I had ~learned&#xD;
from her animated manner that she thirsted for different&#xD;
scenes, new faces and new conversation, to ive a fresh cur-&#xD;
rent to her jaded thoughts. She preferred a party at Miss&#xD;
Cardover's beyond all other places, for the hostess had a&#xD;
cordial freedom of manner that banished f~ mality.&#xD;
"Grace, will you go now?" said Cons n Mam'y, after a&#xD;
while; "you had better."&#xD;
C-race consented. Evening came; W lter and James&#xD;
were ready to accompany us; the former 1 oked like "pa-&#xD;
tience, on a monument, smiling at grief; ' the latter re-&#xD;
minded one of a bridegroom in a new coat n~t yet settled to&#xD;
his figure, so unusually dressed was he.&#xD;
"May II?" said Gertrude, standing before him with a&#xD;
threatening gesture.&#xD;
Yes," said I, at a venture, "you may, Gei'ty."&#xD;
She rushed her slender hand through his smooth locks7&#xD;
and swept them back from his white brow. We all uttered&#xD;
an exclamation of surprise at the improvement it made in&#xD;
his appearance, and extorted from him a promise always to..&#xD;
brush his hair back.&#xD;
"Why, he's real good-looking that way," said Josey,&#xD;
scanning his face seriously; "there isn't a freckle on his&#xD;
forehead! " and she danced around all rapture, until a look&#xD;
from Grace made her suddenly cover her mouth with a dim-&#xD;
pled hand, and blush scarlet at the impropriety of her re-&#xD;
mark.&#xD;
Grace looked very lovely: a white gossamer dress floated&#xD;
around her figure;' the flowing sleeves were caught up,. and&#xD;
looped at the shoulder, with a tiny pair of gold bracelets,&#xD;

&#xD;
which she had worn when a babe. A gold pin fastened her&#xD;
dress at the throat. She wore the wreath of white buds&#xD;
and green leaves which I had made for Mary; it rested like&#xD;
a crown around her nobly-shaped head. There was a moon-&#xD;
light sweetness in her face, which had scarcely dwelt there&#xD;
when the richness of life abounded with her. Mr. Bedell&#xD;
gazed upon her with more earnest eyes than any.&#xD;
"You look so beautiftd, so very, very beautiful !" mur-&#xD;
mured Josephine, putting her fi~ir arm around her waist, and&#xD;
looking up with worshipping. eyes. Gertrude smiled her&#xD;
praise, atA kissed her hand which she held within her own.&#xD;
"Shall we go?" asked Grace abruptly. Large tears&#xD;
had gathered in her eyes; praise struck her heart with a&#xD;
pang; she should listen never more to the praise that was&#xD;
sweetest.&#xD;
Arrived at Miss Oardover's, every thing was gay confu-&#xD;
sion; all doors stood open, even as the doors within her frank&#xD;
heart. Lilly 'eardover ushered the gentlemen to their dres-&#xD;
sing room, and a colored servant led the way to ours. It&#xD;
was an ample room; a great, old-fashioned mahogany bed-&#xD;
stead occupied one corner, draped with the purest white; the&#xD;
snowy window curtains flowed down with a sort of generous&#xD;
improvidence; the dressing bureau, washstand, and antique&#xD;
ewer and basin, all led the thoughts to years gone by. The&#xD;
portraits of Miss Cardover's parents hung on the walls; dear&#xD;
old people, they still looked as genial, but more withered and&#xD;
aged. I could not forbear looking around the room with in-&#xD;
terest; I had never been up stairs before, and in this house&#xD;
were spent the lives of those we loved.&#xD;
A light figure came tripping into the dressing-room; I&#xD;
knew that graceful step. Judith stood before us; she&#xD;
dropped her shawl from her shoulders, and with slight con-&#xD;
fusion of manner looked at us, as if doubtful whether we&#xD;
would speak.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good evening," said I very coldly.&#xD;
"(3ood evening, Miss Hamilton," she returned; then&#xD;
she glanced at Grace, who had grown very white. With a&#xD;
strong effort she mastered the anguish that seized her; she&#xD;
Iooke l at Judith calmly, as she said quietly,&#xD;
"Good evening, Judith." In that accent I read that&#xD;
there was pride in Grace's nature; she had made a powerful&#xD;
effort not to change her manner greatly, that her successful&#xD;
rival might not learn aught of the fearful tempest that had&#xD;
swept down upon her.&#xD;
"Kate, wilL you button my glove?" Grace asked in the&#xD;
same quiet tone, but she turned her face so, that Judith&#xD;
could not observe it. As I took a parting look at the beau-&#xD;
tiful belle ore leaving the room, I felt how hard it was to&#xD;
break from the spell of physical loveliness :-I thought if&#xD;
death should come and unrobe that splendid creature, the&#xD;
superb casket would be despoiled, and instead of the ex-&#xD;
pected jewels, only flints of selfishness would be found with&#xD;
power to wound throughout eternity. iler dress was of&#xD;
pale blue satin, over which lightly waved illusion lace; a&#xD;
light gold chain glittered upon her neck, and her beautiful&#xD;
arms gleamed with jewels. A wreath of pale blue flowers&#xD;
was twined ~around her head; it swept back a portion of her&#xD;
abundant ringlets from her face. I felt thankful that we&#xD;
were not to meet Mr. Benzoni%: we had learned through&#xD;
Frank Morton that he had h~tely~~onc to Italy.&#xD;
"It was best for me to speak to her, was it not?" in-&#xD;
quired Grace, as we descended the stairs. We wended our&#xD;
way through the hall and entered the conservatory, for&#xD;
Grace was still too much agitated to enter the parlors.&#xD;
"Yes, I think it was," I returned. "We often meeting&#xD;
society, and it excites remark where persons are not cour-&#xD;
teous to each other; besides, she will not think how deeply&#xD;

&#xD;
she has smitten you if' you treat her with ordinary polite-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"If thought of that," responded Grace; "and I also&#xD;
thought I ought to forgive her. I do not, II know ]i do not;&#xD;
sometimes when T alp praying, a momentary softness pene-&#xD;
trates my feelings for her; I realize that she i~ wandering&#xD;
from final peace; I almost pity her, but soon again the hard-&#xD;
ness returns to me, and flood after fl6od overwhelms me,&#xD;
until I despair of ever regarding her as a child of the Eter-&#xD;
nal-a soul as precious to the Most High as my own, or&#xD;
yours. I feel, Kate, that my great suffering will not depart&#xD;
until I learn to forgive. I can forgive him; all the wrong&#xD;
I involuntarily attribute to her. I did not think she would&#xD;
be here to-nio'U: Miss Cardover does not admire her, I&#xD;
think."&#xD;
(C I should judge not. Perhaps Mr. Cardover desired&#xD;
her to be invited," Ii answered hastily. "Shall we go in the&#xD;
parlors now ?" We went into- the ball, and followed behind&#xD;
a party who were just entering the room. Judith was first.&#xD;
Mr. Cardover came forward to welcome her, his fine counte-&#xD;
nance beaming with an expression that awoke a forgotten&#xD;
pang within me. I felt as if a circle of light was around&#xD;
her radiant head, whbn his beautiful glance recognized her.&#xD;
I saw that he loved her. I leaned on Walter's arm; I felt&#xD;
it tremble, as he caugh~ ~ght of Judith. Fortunately he&#xD;
seated me by a table fiil~ with engravings. I listened~ to&#xD;
the hushed murmur of' applause that greeted the belle,&#xD;
and knew how proud Mr Cardover was of her. I had&#xD;
divined from his manner~ nd look that he did not sus-&#xD;
pec~ the relation Mr. Ben oni bore to the bright coquette.&#xD;
We had not mentioned Mr. Benzopi's name to any one since&#xD;
the dissolution of Grace's engagement. Grace seated her-&#xD;
self beside the aged pair of the household, Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
(5ardover. who talked with her, and bestowed upon her the&#xD;
&#xD;
fond glances with which the old repay the young who care&#xD;
for them.&#xD;
I took up an engraving, and bent my eyes upon it; but&#xD;
my thoughi~s were not upon the picture. The powerful in-&#xD;
fluence that had swept over me once before when I saw Mr.&#xD;
Cardover speak to Judith, again stirred within my soul; an&#xD;
irrepressible yearning arose; an anguished feeling; involun-&#xD;
tarily I followed her with my eyes. She was conversing with&#xD;
two young men, who listened and flirted in very fashionable&#xD;
style. I saw her only as the realization of a vision of hope&#xD;
and joy to one being;~ she was the star of his existence, and&#xD;
his gla~ices sought, her pften. Why should I care'? Was&#xD;
it possible that I had mistaken the character of my friend-&#xD;
ship for him? Was it possible that I felt an 'undue interest&#xD;
in him'? The proud blood rose to my brow at the thought,&#xD;
and with it sprung a self-disdainful resolve to rid my nature&#xD;
of such folly. I had ever looked with impatient scorn upon&#xD;
women who have no need of being won. I thanked Heaven&#xD;
that the feelings that had surprised me 'were but ~incipient&#xD;
~ancies, easy to control, to cast under foot. A powerful&#xD;
~bride arose within me; I exulted in it; I was glad to know&#xD;
that it would enable me to break my heart, should an hour&#xD;
of necessity come. As II mechanically turned over the en-&#xD;
gravings upon the table, a kind clear voice spoke to me. It&#xD;
was Mi'. Waldron's. lie sat beside me, and looked at the&#xD;
pictures, sometimes talking, and sometimes lqokingatt'he~&#xD;
guests. His gaze riveted itself upon Judith, then his' eyes&#xD;
sought Grace, and turned rrom one to the other~ at last&#xD;
dwelling earnestly upon my cousin. I thought he would&#xD;
fain have read her thoughts, would fain have learned the&#xD;
moving springs of that young nature. She was quiet in all&#xD;
her naovQments; she did' noV wrong herself by affecting a&#xD;
gayety she did not feel; she rather sought to soothe the pain&#xD;
within, by low converse with those who were 'neither bril~&#xD;

liant nor attractive. A slight flush was npon her cheeks; it&#xD;
enhanced her beauty7 and gave her countenance a brightness&#xD;
that was not reflected from her heart. She shunned atten-&#xD;
tion, while Judith eagerly sought it, yet it pleased me to see&#xD;
that Grace was admired. While we were looking at her,&#xD;
sets were forming for cotillions; she was led out to dance;&#xD;
at the same mop~ient, Mr. Bedell came forward to fulfil an&#xD;
engagement with me. Afterwards he danced with Grace,&#xD;
and looked so very happy. Walter was on the floor perpet-&#xD;
ually, and awoke many a peal of joyous laughter by his gay&#xD;
sallies; to others his spirits did not seem forced.&#xD;
%3frace proposed leaving early, and II was heartily glad of&#xD;
it. When we went upin the dressing-room, I looked in the&#xD;
glass earnestly, first to s~e if I looked cheerful. I was con-&#xD;
vinced that the flash in my eyes and the glow on my cheeks&#xD;
could easily be mistaken for pleasure. Next I looked to see&#xD;
if I had any attractions; it had never occurred to me that I&#xD;
could be pretty, a~ I had never been used to flattery. I had&#xD;
overheard a stranger remarking favorably on my looks.&#xD;
Now I compared my face with the bright, young counte-&#xD;
nances below. I felt that it might pass among them without&#xD;
remar~; perhaps to some it might seem fair. I felt grateful&#xD;
for thi~; I had feared my soul was set in. a casket that could&#xD;
not please.&#xD;
On the way home Mr. Beddll declared that he had never&#xD;
passed1 so delightful an evening.&#xD;
"Delightfull" retorted Walter, with frightful energy.&#xD;
I never saw snch tameness and stupidity in a company in&#xD;
my life."&#xD;
"Was it so, Kate?" propounded James gravely. Under&#xD;
the light of the moon I saw that his eyes twinkled with&#xD;
laughter at Walter's state of mind. How easy it. is to be&#xD;
heartless when we are happy.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It seemed to me," I answered, "like a very happy com-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
"Grace, wasn't it dull?" demanded Walter. "Every&#xD;
body was artificial."&#xD;
"I have enjoyed parties better," she ?returned. James&#xD;
seemed somewhat struck with surprise at this answer, and&#xD;
was meditative all the rest of the way home. He walked&#xD;
with Grace, and bent his ear to her lips whenever her gentle&#xD;
voice uttered a word.&#xD;
We l4urried to our chamber. Grace threw off her wreath&#xD;
of flowers with .a kind of bitterness; then she unclasped the&#xD;
little gold bracelets from her shoulders, and held them in&#xD;
her hands a moment, looking at them through gathering&#xD;
tears. They took her back to her peaceful infane~. She&#xD;
hastily thrust them into her rosewood box of trinkets, and&#xD;
began unbraiding the rich hair I had taken so much pains&#xD;
with. She pushed it back as if any attempt at ornament&#xD;
were irksqme to her. I was tired, and crept in bed a few&#xD;
moments after we entei~ed the room. Grace sat down before&#xD;
the ~dressing-table and began to write.&#xD;
"Oh, Grace," I exclaimed, "not to-night! it is late."&#xD;
"Yes, I must," she responded. In the morning, when I&#xD;
was putting away some little ornaments in the rosewood box;&#xD;
I saw the paper Grace had been writing on the night pre-&#xD;
vious.&#xD;
"May I read it?" I asked, turning around and holding&#xD;
it up before her. She slowly shook her head, looking at~ me&#xD;
the while with her dear kind eyes.&#xD;
"It may do me good," I pleaded.&#xD;
She smiled sadly, and said, "Do as you wish, dear."&#xD;
She went down stairs, and I sat down to read her midnight&#xD;
thoughts. They ran as follows&#xD;
"This whole weary evening I have waited for this mo-&#xD;
mont, when I could be alone with God-when I could pour&#xD;

The sight of Judith awoke a consuming pain within me, and&#xD;

but tl~ine be done.' I must bow to the chastener ! I will /~&#xD;
Not until this night have I gained even a momentary con-&#xD;
sent from my soul ~o suffer. I ~eeined to be lifted on high&#xD;
an instant, looking upon my life from eternity, and perceiv-&#xD;
ing the necessity of this hour for the development of a har-&#xD;
monious, final~ whole. But when 1 thought 'I could repose&#xD;
on this hope, I fell hack amid all my struggles. Shall I&#xD;
again on earth taste of peace'? Shall I learn to feel with&#xD;
* gratitude that there is much that is beautiful in the world?&#xD;
I think upon the absent one! How little Ii dreamed once&#xD;
that his gift to me would be a soul-world wakened into a&#xD;
wild agony and bitterness. If II had never scen him, this&#xD;
cruel tempest would never have aroused itself, threatening&#xD;
my life's foundations. I think of the words of Queen Esther&#xD;
with a sort of consolation: 'If I perish, I perish.' But I&#xD;
cannot forbear. dwelling upon. Giovanni with incessant, ago-&#xD;
nized yearning: at times only love and tenderness sweep&#xD;
over me; ]I could bear all, if I did not fear his steps were&#xD;
tending to eternal woe. If I could save him! if. I could&#xD;
help him! Oh! the dreams of doing him good that must&#xD;
die! Lost! 'lost to me! I can never reach his averted&#xD;
heart. Often I could dash away every brightness, to sleep&#xD;
in eternal oblivion. I grow weary of the battle. Some-&#xD;
times dear words of Holy Writ come to ~me, when I lean&#xD;
over the gulf of despair. My God! impress upon my un-&#xD;
happy heart the conviction that all trials which we cannot&#xD;
avert, are permitted for some use. They are of use to the&#xD;
innocent-how is it with the guilty? Oh Giovanni! if this&#xD;
&#xD;
suffethig could bless you, I would walk through the furnace&#xD;
were it seven times heated. But here is the anguish! here&#xD;
am I helpless! Every morning when I rise, I pray so ear-&#xD;
n estly fo~ strength to endure the day; it seems as if I should&#xD;
give way, and sink into th~ arms of death. Sometimes I&#xD;
ca1~ot weep tears that are a luxury and relief; the fountain&#xD;
~s withered. Alas! it is a wicked joy to me to see that I&#xD;
grow thinner day by day-to see that my strength lessens.&#xD;
The agony of life has rolled upon me with an overwhelming&#xD;
wcirht and I pray in my madness for death! Ay, more&#xD;
entreatingly than my you~g soul ever prayed to realize beau-&#xD;
tiful dreams of life. Ii dare not pray to God foil death, but&#xD;
it is a thirsting thought within me. Resignation! Oh,&#xD;
God, give it me! Remove this anguish which strikes at the&#xD;
roots of my being; it plucks out life fro~n every hope which&#xD;
sweetly charmed me for the future. Oh, to live thus! and&#xD;
yet for three weeks I ht~ve been in this living death. I&#xD;
learn each day how many charms were once comprised in&#xD;
my thoughts of life-of the world. I have often with im-&#xD;
pious pride thought I should have strength for any trials that&#xD;
might befall me; but I am ~o helpless,. so agonized, so cow-&#xD;
ardly. ]i shrink with .terror inexpressible from the dispensa-&#xD;
tions of that Being who 'doeth all things well.' And yet&#xD;
in the very deepest depths of my soul, I feel that I need this&#xD;
suffering-that it must be. I striy&amp;amp; to bear up before our&#xD;
beloved ones; to speak cheerfully while the arrow of death&#xD;
quivers at my heart-strings. Sometimes when I am alone,&#xD;
Josephine comes to me, and looks earnestly in my eyes'; I&#xD;
lift her in my lap; she strokes: my hair, and lays her cheek&#xD;
to mine. Then I am killed to forgetfulness by her soothing&#xD;
caress. Mary talks to me from th~ experiences of her own&#xD;
heart; it blesses me. To lose happiness 'is an agony so&#xD;
sharp; if others move on with ease, why should not I? Why&#xD;
cannot I keep my soul quiet? I feel so unsatisfied 'with the&#xD;

I had read through fast falling tears this record of the&#xD;
profound passion and agony of Grace's soul. I almost won-&#xD;
dered and trembled to comprehend the capacity of suffering&#xD;
in our natures. Ii had not dreamed that Grace had suffered&#xD;
so much, wheu she kept on her quiet way, as if nothing had&#xD;
happened. Cowardly she called herseW and yet through&#xD;
her fearful baptism of woe her heroic lips had been sealed;&#xD;
she entreated no sympathy, she uttered no complaint, but&#xD;
when 'encouraging words were spoken to her, she listened&#xD;
with a hungry, devouring look in her large eyes, as if she&#xD;
had great need of strength. The manuscript did me good; it&#xD;
made me thank God fervently that the depths of my soul&#xD;
were yet unmoved. The feelings that had briefly been&#xD;
awakened within me, seemed very light and superficial. I&#xD;
blushed to remember them, and blushed more deeply still to&#xD;
recall the tears I had once shed. In my folly I had momen-&#xD;
tarily imagined~ myself within the temple of Cupid, when I&#xD;
had only be&amp;amp;w hovering around the door, looking in, and&#xD;
crying because I could ii&amp;amp;t go in. I laid the paper in the&#xD;
box, and began washing away traces of my tears, with the&#xD;
expression, "Oh, Kate Hamilton, it is astonishing what a lit-&#xD;
tle idiot you can tuanage to Nbc. I think it's time you went&#xD;
in search of a little common sense. Will you not, and quit&#xD;
your foolishness?"&#xD;
&#xD;
ChAPTER ~XI&#xD;
THE breath of spring came and touched Cousin John with&#xD;
its healing wand; he had recovered from his rheumatsm,&#xD;
but ill health had not yet entirely released him; he sat by&#xD;
the fire as moody as ever; we almost feared he would be-&#xD;
come a hypochondriac, or we should have feared it, if his&#xD;
crossness had not been a signal of some kind of vitality. It&#xD;
was hard for him to bring down his stately head to a clerk-&#xD;
ship, and yet we seemed to be drawing daily nearer the&#xD;
yawning gulf of poverty. Cousin Mary 'was a gem of a&#xD;
manager; but there were many little calls for debts, and the&#xD;
money often went by mutual consent that way, if there was&#xD;
any in the house. Sometimes I thought Cousin Mary feared&#xD;
her husband would never regain his active business habits.&#xD;
I imagined she never spoke to him on the subject. He was&#xD;
apt to think we were not deeply penetrated with affliction on&#xD;
account of. his aches and *pains. lie never re~lIy said so,&#xD;
but the truth gleamod on us~ nevertheless. If he had ever&#xD;
thanked us we should have been all sympathy. The poor&#xD;
wife's active step had grown feeble in his service; her eyes&#xD;
began to look hollow; she was weary and worn with physic&#xD;
cal labor.&#xD;
Grace sat at her painting. For the first time in many&#xD;

&#xD;
weeks her sweet voice warbled forth a song; a low, sad&#xD;
thing it was, but it was blessed music to those who loved&#xD;
her. Cousin Mary glanced at me furtively; her eyes shone&#xD;
with gratification.&#xD;
~C Stop your singing over there, will you?" broke in Mr.&#xD;
iRodman. "I should like to take my nap some time this af-&#xD;
ternoon. You three contrive to talk incessantly, when the&#xD;
children are not here to make a noise."&#xD;
Cousin Mary's usually calm eyes flashed fire. "if you&#xD;
wish to take a nap, the bedroom is the proper place," she&#xD;
exclaimed. "We should sometimes like to have freedom of&#xD;
speech in this room."&#xD;
Cousin John turned slowly around, and gazed at his&#xD;
wife, as if overpowered with astonishment; he expected to&#xD;
see her eyes droop with sudden gentleness after her boldness.&#xD;
lie had pressed her too far of late. She looked straight at&#xD;
him, and all the hoarded defiance of tears was in her steady&#xD;
eyes; her lip was curved with a haughty scorn; she had&#xD;
burst her bonds, and all the deep passions of her nature&#xD;
were aroused. For tears she had striven to be a devoted&#xD;
wife; she had regarded it as her life-work to aid in raising&#xD;
up the image of God i\u her husband's soul. The manner in&#xD;
which he had met the chastisements of lleaNen, had slowly&#xD;
driven hope from her heart. The sun which had shone upon&#xD;
her path had set; her great hope had gone down. Of late&#xD;
she had frequently acted according to her own judgment, and&#xD;
had met the reproaches of her husband with a firm, complete&#xD;
coldness an~ silence;' then again, she would seem to return&#xD;
to her former manner, to her former hope. Mr. Roman&#xD;
did not reply to his wife; he threw his handkerchief~ over&#xD;
his face, and leaned his head back in his arm-chair. She&#xD;
said no more; she resumed her sewing, but a fiery spot had&#xD;
gathered in each cheek; her deeply red lips were compressed&#xD;
together, with a look of determination at once powerful and&#xD;
&#xD;
quiet. Grace and I felt that we should not have witnessed&#xD;
the scene; we felt very uncomfortable; we rose simulta-&#xD;
neously to leave the room. Cousin Mary rose also, and&#xD;
went to the kitchen to prepare supper. At the tea-table&#xD;
all was calm and quiet as usual. Walter and James looked&#xD;
inquiringly at Cousin Mary, doubtless wondering at the fire&#xD;
in her eye, and the unusual flush 'upon her cheeks. Grace&#xD;
and I washed the tea things% and Mrs. iRodman ~vent to the&#xD;
nursery alone.&#xD;
Ma's writing a letter!" said Josephine, dancing around&#xD;
the room; she stopped in the midst of her pirouetting, half&#xD;
expecting a rebuke from her father, but he was silent and&#xD;
gloomy. In her solitude cousin Mary wrote thus:&#xD;
)&#xD;
DEAR JoIIN,-I think you have never understood me.&#xD;
I write because I can say every thought that has been&#xD;
slumbering in my heart for years ;-I write, because your&#xD;
cold look will not stifle me, as it often has done, when I&#xD;
would have uttered things I wished to speak ;-I write,&#xD;
because you will read it, and not cast it aside with a" pshaw!"&#xD;
as you do always my soul's deepest spoken thoughts. The&#xD;
time has come for us to know each other; my long suffering&#xD;
is past. My love for you is extinguished'; has been extin-&#xD;
guished for years, and yet you have been my tormentor for&#xD;
sixteen long years. My woe commenced almost' as soon as&#xD;
the marriage vows were pronounced; and yet I loved you&#xD;
with all the strength of my nature, or rather I thought I&#xD;
did. You were all the world to me. And you said you&#xD;
loved me: probably you did. But with a love I despise; it&#xD;
has all the characteristics of hatred towards me. Oh! for-&#xD;
give this hard and cutting speech; it' has been in nay heart&#xD;
many times, but never on my tongue. I am tired of simu-&#xD;
lation now; I must pour out all the truth. John 1 do you&#xD;
remember the first year we were married? how you petted&#xD;

me when you were good-natured, and struck me ~jth cold,&#xD;
harsh words when any thing changed your mood? Did you&#xD;
never see how hard it was for me to keep down the bitter&#xD;
answers that sprung to my lips? Did you take my quietness&#xD;
for Want of feeling? did you think me amiable, when the&#xD;
wild tempest of retaliation was heaving my heart? or did&#xD;
you never think at all of me in my misery, lying on the floor&#xD;
weeping after you had gone? Did you never dream that&#xD;
your selfishness could alienate me? have you to this hour,&#xD;
dreamed that within my breast no world existed? no world&#xD;
filled with thoughts, hopes, fears, emotions? Have you&#xD;
thought my spirit blank, whereon no writing might be&#xD;
stamped? You have not ceased to sow your seed, from that&#xD;
first year,-from that time until now, have I remained&#xD;
bound, seldom answering back. Ii feared bitter, open quar-&#xD;
rels; II feared to destroy the little vestige of peace within&#xD;
our home. I feared to let our children witness the strong&#xD;
passions sleeping in their mother's heart. I feared myself;&#xD;
I trembled lest IL should become a scolding virago. Instead,&#xD;
I have become a reserved, self-controlled woman,-1 have&#xD;
set foot upon the little frankness God gave me. Yet. ]i have&#xD;
wrestled for a forgiving spirit,-.1 have prayed long hours&#xD;
for strength to pluck the virtue from my trial. Ii do not re-&#xD;
gret our marriage; my stubborn nature was one which must&#xD;
tread over burning ploughshares, ere it could be conquered,&#xD;
ere it could become unselfish. I do not, when I look over&#xD;
my life, as God must vieW it, regi~et~ that I have not had as&#xD;
many joys as others have had. I do in truth, owe you thanks.&#xD;
You drove me to God. Past hours come before me; I can&#xD;
recall the time when I dared no longer sit upon your knee;&#xD;
I dared not hasten to you with a kiss when you came home;&#xD;
I dared not pass my hand through your hair, or even rest~&#xD;
i&#xD;
my arm upon your shoulder. An instinctive feeling taught&#xD;
me that you would throw me off, and that my heart would&#xD;

near ou, and wanted to sit upon your knee, and tell you all&#xD;
my t ought, and listen to yours. "Oh, love me! I must&#xD;
be Joy d," was the cry of my heart. 1~U dared not speak&#xD;
it, les you slThuId fhink me a very tedious wife, and wish I&#xD;
had n t such thoughts and feelings. Then have I said to&#xD;
inysel "Oh, heart! always thus must you kneel and pray&#xD;
for a 1 ttle love?"&#xD;
Al s! the days when i[ met a caressing smile from you,&#xD;
went nto the eternal, past. I scarcely know how it came&#xD;
about. I know in those early days II w~is less calm, less pa-&#xD;
tient t an I am now; but after I had learned to implore&#xD;
Cod's elp in my necessity, the alienation went on; you did&#xD;
not he d my efforts to mould myself to your wishes. And.&#xD;
then I wept because my youthful looks were fading, and be-&#xD;
cause ~ou sometimes spoke of it. You did not love me, you&#xD;
did not look for the heart; you placed an immense value upon&#xD;
physical bloom, while bloom of soul was considered of little&#xD;
worth. I knew that the morning of my youth had departed;&#xD;
that materialists and sensualists would see no sweetness or&#xD;
freshness in me; but oh, when I married; I ~aid to myself,&#xD;
"Here is one friend who will be faithful unto death, who will&#xD;
love me when other friends fall away; Who will clasp me&#xD;
closer to his heart when the passing years shall 'have proven&#xD;
that I am worthy of his affection." I found that IL must b~&#xD;
gauged by this perishing body, instead of my immortal soul.&#xD;
us it strange that I cried to the years, "Stay back! take not&#xD;
from m~ the little youth Ii have. Oh, condemn me not to&#xD;
lose ev~ry charm in my husband's eyes! " IAove! celestial&#xD;
in thin~ origin, thou clingest to the celestial spirits.-thou&#xD;
takes little heed of material changes. I knew an adored&#xD;

world of love, while I, alas! am shut out." She never knew&#xD;
What it was to be valued most for bodily nwrits. You tried&#xD;
hard to win me, for I was shy 'and fled from you. I did not&#xD;
know how to act towards you. But I have often asked my-&#xD;
self; "Was it love that led him to seek me? Did he ever&#xD;
feel all the warmth, the glow, tbe sWeetness of genuine love&#xD;
when he wrote to me loving words, and' whispered them in&#xD;
my ear ?" Then I would go to your old letters and read&#xD;
them, to convince myself that I had not boon too carelessly&#xD;
won; and there I read that I Was more beautiful in your&#xD;
eyes than another woman, more dear and precious; there&#xD;
you promised to watch over my happiness always, to guard'&#xD;
me from all the storms of life-your own breast should be&#xD;
bared to shield your little flower. Now there seems a most&#xD;
bitter ir~ny in those words. Since our marriage, my own&#xD;
heart has been bared to receive your strokes, yours alone-&#xD;
the world has had no storms to terrWy me. If, wheff I stood&#xD;
at the altar, robed in white, with the orange flowers upop&#xD;
my head; the curtain had been lifted, how I should have&#xD;
despaired. Qh, misery! to have seen that you would love&#xD;
me less, instead of more. I remember the evening after our&#xD;
marriage~ I s~it at your feet and rested my head against your&#xD;
knee; holy thkmghts stole over me. You laid your hand,&#xD;
oh, so lightly, so tenderly upon my brow, and whispered,&#xD;
"What is my darling thinking of? She must tell mc all her&#xD;
thoughts now." And tears of a strange gladness dropped&#xD;
from my eyes-I thought I saw a picture of our blessed life&#xD;
together. I told you all my dreaming, my aspirati5s, and&#xD;
you listened. All was calm without; we sat on the old front&#xD;
porch at home; the quiet night air passed over my face, the&#xD;
lightning played in the sky, and one or two stars came out&#xD;
and shone through the darkness. Dear John I I must be-&#xD;

there might be friendship between us. I wish, for my hap-&#xD;
pines&amp;amp; sake, you would keep back cold irritable words. have&#xD;
mercy upon me. II cannot get used to them. I cannot shield&#xD;
myself from a fresh pang every time you speak to me so. Ali,&#xD;
think what a different life ours might haib been, if you had&#xD;
early taught yourself to guard your lips, to care for the fccl-&#xD;
ings of those around you. Our darling children fear you.&#xD;
I would not give you pain, but 1 sat down to write the truth,&#xD;
and I will say it all. Many a time have they hastened from&#xD;
your presence, saying to cach other, "Quick! there comes&#xD;
father!" One morning I found Josephine with her apron&#xD;
to her eyes, crying passionately. I a~ked her what the mat-&#xD;
ter was; she said her Sunday School teacher said that&#xD;
"little girls who did not love their parents never could go to&#xD;
Heaven." And she buried her face in her apron again, sob-&#xD;
'bing in her childish de~pair.&#xD;
"But you l'ove your parents, don't you, Josephine?" I&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"I don't love father. I can't, I can't. I do sometimes,&#xD;
when he is good to me, but I hate him almost every day. Oh,&#xD;
mother, must I go to the bad place?"&#xD;
It is a terrible tiling to make such an impress upon an&#xD;
innocent soul. For God's sake! do not waken in our chil-&#xD;
dren's hearts the volcano of fierce passions that you. awoke&#xD;
in mine. I have said that you have not understood me; you&#xD;
have judged mc by the calm severe exterior' I have unhappily&#xD;
mired. Not always am I thus calm, thus staid even in&#xD;
my exterior; my heart gushes forth at intervals ~vhen I pray&#xD;

"The stream that seems to thee so still&#xD;
Hath such a tide below."&#xD;
~Jobn, my husband, for the last time let me plead with&#xD;
you, not for my sake, but for your own. I can bear a few&#xD;
m6re sad years, and I see glorious visions beyond the gate&#xD;
of the grave. iBut have you reflected upon your coming des-&#xD;
tiny "?. At the risk of your bitterest hate, I must beg you to&#xD;
think--to realize that you are hypocrite, and that your doom&#xD;
will be that of the hypocrite, unless you spend the years left&#xD;
you in' undoing the past, in retracing old steps, and beginning&#xD;
all anew. IDo you remember that you profess to be a disci-&#xD;
ple of the Saviour? Do you remember that you go to the&#xD;
holy table, and partake of consecrated bread with an uncon-&#xD;
secrated heart? Do you remember that your lips utter,&#xD;
"Therefore, with angels and archangels, and all the company&#xD;
of Heaven, we laud and magnify Thy glorious Name; ever-&#xD;
more praising Thee, and saying, holy, holy, holy Lord God&#xD;
of Hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory," when the&#xD;
"lloly"is a stranger to your soul? Do you realize that&#xD;
you are oiie of the unworthy ?-.a Pharisee, who will be cast&#xD;
into outer darkness when the door of the eternal 'world shall&#xD;
open? Not 'with self-righteousness do I speak, but with&#xD;
warm beseeehin~ prayers. Oh, forgive me all the feelings I&#xD;
have showed you.' You can never know how often the dove&#xD;
of humility drove them away. Let me be a sister to you, a&#xD;
friend, the mother of your children. I will never ask for a&#xD;
fondness you cannot give, but let me be your soul's truest&#xD;
friend. .1 commenced this letter, feeling utterly, eternally&#xD;
driven from you; but my better angel has returned. Be all&#xD;
that you may be, true and good; and I will dedicate myself&#xD;
to you as I never did before, without reserve, without n~ea-&#xD;
sure.. I have striven for your comfort from a sense of d~~ty.&#xD;
Once, hope was with me; I trusted that after, patient y4ars&#xD;
you might gain a gentler spirit; but slowly and surely ~iou&#xD;
&#xD;
have gone on a downward path; you have fallen into no&#xD;
vices outwardly, but. the tenor of your inward being 'is&#xD;
changed-it has grown fatally worse. 0, think of what you&#xD;
are capable! think of the strength God gives to the earnest&#xD;
spirit. You might be one whom I could admire and reve-&#xD;
rence. Give me hope once more I Chai~ge our home into a&#xD;
paradise. We could all sooner lose material comforts than&#xD;
the sunshine from an honest spirit. Be one of us !-one&#xD;
whom we may all trust and love, and a tide of warm devo-&#xD;
tion will set towards you. The years of eartPly life that yet&#xD;
remain may be tinged with a more golden hue than past ones.&#xD;
Cast not this prayer away! It appeals to all that is best&#xD;
within you. Shut not out the angel that stoops to fan the&#xD;
dying embers of conscience. Shut not out the God who uses&#xD;
human instrumentality to awaken you from your death-slum-&#xD;

his shrinking heart. He took his hat and went into the&#xD;
street. Cousin Mary immediately came from herroom, with&#xD;
a miserable look of anxiety upon her pale face; a sort of de-&#xD;
vouring regret was in her eyes, as she watched her husband&#xD;
from the window. Had she struck apart the last link that~&#xD;
bound him to her? Had she supplanted indifference with&#xD;
mad hate? At noon he came home; there was no trace of&#xD;
agitation upon his features; his iron will kept back the agony.&#xD;
At the dinner-table he was scrupulously polite to all of us.&#xD;
"Shall I have the honor of helping you, madam? "he asked&#xD;
with bitter sarcasm, looking at his wife.&#xD;
"If you please," she answered calmly as -usual. I sat&#xD;
next her; her low, quick breathing, indicated interior an-&#xD;
guish. This fevered, steady breathing is terrible; W is as if&#xD;
the heart were telling out its most fearful strokes. Husband&#xD;
and wife strove tc~ eat; Cousin Mary could not. She rose&#xD;
and went to her ~rooin; the "boys "left soon after, and the&#xD;
children cleared the table with quiet motions. Mr. Rodman&#xD;
pushed back his chair, and followed with his eyes their' every&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
step; he looked into their faces with an eager, wistful, most&#xD;
painful expressiQn. They observed it, and hastened their&#xD;
work; hastened with their dishes to the kitchen. When the&#xD;
door closed, Joseiihine's voice exclaimed,&#xD;
"See what a lot of dishes I brought at on~e," and both&#xD;
of them broke into merry laughter, as if just entered within&#xD;
the domain of freedom. Their cheerful chattii~g rose from&#xD;
below, often interrupted with shouts of mirth; fhe two chil-&#xD;
dren have the richest, sweetest laugh that ever broke from&#xD;
rosy lips. They came back together, and with a staid, grave&#xD;
manner removed the table-cloth; they were about setting the&#xD;
table in it~ place, when their father rose and did it for them.&#xD;
With a glad " Come! "they started for the nursery ;.-the&#xD;
weather was mild enough for them to occupy their old quar-&#xD;
ters. With a sigh Mr. Hodman went away again. . At tea,&#xD;
he treated his wife with the same sarcastic politeness as at&#xD;
dinner.&#xD;
"My head aches as if it would burst," Cousin Nary said,,&#xD;
in the evening, in a stifled tone, as she laid down her sewing.&#xD;
"I fear I am going to be ill. I must have a doctor. More&#xD;
expenses !"&#xD;
"What are expenses compared with your health?" asked&#xD;
Grace,. springing to her side and laying her cool hand upon&#xD;
her hot forehead. "Oh, Mary, you have been killing your-&#xD;
self lately; you have not been used to such hard work, and&#xD;
to such broken sleep as you have had this winter."&#xD;
Mr. IRodman left instantly for a physician, and we placed&#xD;
our de~r one in bed, looking with sudden fear into her bril-&#xD;
liant eyes, upon her glowing cheeks. The doctor pronounced&#xD;
her in a dangerous condition; a violent fever had set in; we&#xD;
watched her all night, and Mr. Rodman took no rest; he&#xD;
walked the dining-room witb heavy, hasty steps, until Grace&#xD;
besought him not to disturb his wife thus. "I was not think-&#xD;
ing," he ausw~red, and kept lAs watch henceforth very quiet-&#xD;

&#xD;
ly. Every few moments he came to the door, and inquired&#xD;
how she was; he glanced at her, but did not go near her.&#xD;
In the morning he was haggard and pale. Cousin Mary was&#xD;
a little better; we left her to attend family prayers. Mr.&#xD;
liodman did not read with his usual strong, ringing voice;&#xD;
when he prayed, his pride was overcome, his voice trembled;&#xD;
he paused, brushed away fast falling tears, and commenced&#xD;
again. He stopped and rose from his knees; "we lifted up&#xD;
our voices an~ wept," ere we also rose. He went in to see&#xD;
his wife; he ~poke kindly to her; he did not kiss her, utter&#xD;
caressing words, or lay his hand upon her brow or cheek.&#xD;
She did not seem to heed him; aftei~ she had fallen asleep he&#xD;
went out; we hoped he had gone in pursuit of business.&#xD;
Our painting was laid aside, for we needed sleep after our&#xD;
night watching.&#xD;
Three days after the doctor said, "Will you tell Mr.&#xD;
IRodman, Miss Hamilton, that his wife cannot, recover? She&#xD;
may live a day or two!" He spoke in a low voice, "Tell&#xD;
him directly!"&#xD;
I sought Cousin John; he was pacing the nursery; he&#xD;
had just left the sick chamber; he had seen the angel of&#xD;
death hovering over his wife's pillow.&#xD;
"What?" he asked quickly, as - I entered the nursery&#xD;
with traces of violent weeping upon my face.&#xD;
"NYhat?" he repeated, ere I could speak.&#xD;
"She will not live long!"&#xD;
"Does she know any thing~?-any one ? "&#xD;
'' No!&#xD;
"how long?" He could not finish the sentence.&#xD;
"A day or two !" He sunk upon a chair and smote his&#xD;
forehead. "It is a just judgment. She was my only friend.'&#xD;
I left him with his head bowed upon his bosom. I was to&#xD;
watch that night, and Grace made me lie down t~o rest. I&#xD;
entered the spare room; it was ~dark and quiet there, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I should be undisturbed. Cousin John wont down stairs;&#xD;
after a little while I heard him return to the nursery.&#xD;
Broken sobs burst upon my ear~, and a prayer followed.&#xD;
"My God! at last-at last, ~h6i~ hast broken my stony&#xD;
heart-- at last, when my atonement comes too late. The&#xD;
vials of thy wrath are poui~ed upon my head; just thou art,&#xD;
but is thine ear closed to njiercy? May she not live! live&#xD;
but one year, that I may expiate the dreadful past; that IL&#xD;
may heal her broken heart with kindness, such kindness as&#xD;
never man showered upon woilnan,-such kindness as re-&#xD;
morse and repentance create. These dreadful days! are they&#xD;
our last together? Must she go to her grave with my cruel&#xD;
words yet in her ear? Must she never know that in my&#xD;
soul's deepest recesses there is a repentance that is redeem-&#xD;
mo''? Must she never that trtie words struck&#xD;
knpw       her&#xD;
home? Must she still dream that I cannot forgive,-that IL&#xD;
cannot hear the truth that shows me myself ?-that I visit&#xD;
her with cold sarcasm because she prayed me to avoid eternal&#xD;
ruin? Not in vain, my God, didst thou give to my child-&#xD;
hood an angel mother! deeply imbedded in selfishness, her&#xD;
holy teachings have been preserved; they sprung to life&#xD;
when this last arrow pierced me. And must my children&#xD;
be motherless ?-must their feet tread this tempting world&#xD;
without her for their guide'? And now that I rise, and with&#xD;
staggering steps return to my Father's house, must Ii have&#xD;
no faithful one at my side to cheer and strengthen? With&#xD;
broken fortunes and weakened health, must I go down to&#xD;
~ny grave alone ?-must I never meet with the devotion she&#xD;
promised? 0 God! thou cctnst not take her now, when her&#xD;
extinguished love has burst upon me so terribly !-.-not now,&#xD;
when I have just learned that no one cares for me upon the&#xD;
faee of the earth !-not now, when I am stripped of every&#xD;
hope. Alas, my strength is weakness! This stubborn heart&#xD;

&#xD;
love it dreamed that it possessed! While, in my inmost&#xD;
heart, I honored and reverenced her as the purest and best&#xD;
amnng women, I was turning her from me by my strange,&#xD;
blind selfishness. Almighty God, send down thy token!&#xD;
Let the dread destroyer pass by. 'Spare me a little, that&#xD;
I may recover strength, before I go hence, and am no more&#xD;
seen!'"&#xD;
His step passed down stairs again. I fell asleep, aud did&#xD;
not waken until evening, All the family were gathered in&#xD;
the bedroom; the doctor was there also. The children were&#xD;
weeping, or rather Josephine wept. Gertrude watched her&#xD;
mother with an intense gaze; "the fountain of the great&#xD;
deep" had been broken up within her; she h~d all the&#xD;
depth of feeling that characterized Cousin Mary; if she had&#xD;
one passiOn stronger than all others, it was love for her&#xD;
mother. She admired her character; there was the likeness&#xD;
of sympathy between them. If Cousin Mary moved, or&#xD;
uttered a sound, Gertrude's eager look turned to the doctor,&#xD;
to see* if there were any hope; and when she saw no change&#xD;
in ~his quiet face, she pressed her quivering lips together, and&#xD;
turned her gaze of unutterable love upon that pale face&#xD;
again. She had grown so dear to us in this trial; she was so&#xD;
small we had all looked upon her as a mere child, but she&#xD;
had sudderdy become mature in feeling and action. She in-&#xD;
herited her father's irritability; she was somewhat indolent&#xD;
by nature, but it had vanished as if by magic; her light feet&#xD;
hurried from morning until night, and no hasty expression&#xD;
from her broke the spell of tenderness dissolved over the&#xD;
household. Dear Grace! it was bah~i to her own tried&#xD;
heart, to exhaust herself in kindly devices for the invalid.&#xD;
She tried to take Cousin Mary's place in the family;~ she did&#xD;
not seem to know what fatigue was. She wept almost inces-&#xD;
santly when Cousin Mary was first taken ill, and we appre-&#xD;
hended this result; but she was perfectly calm now, and a&#xD;
holy serenity pervaded her countenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XTI.&#xD;

&#xD;
TilE doctor left us to go to a patient, whose life he hoped to&#xD;
save. We sent the children to bed, with the promise of call-&#xD;
ing them should there be any change in their mother, Grace&#xD;
took a pillow, and threw herself on the settee in the dining-&#xD;
room. Mr. IRodman and I remained alone in the sick cham-&#xD;
ber; I sat near Cousin Mary's pillow, and her husband sat&#xD;
at the foot of the bed, leaning his forehead on the footboard.&#xD;
For a long time she was quiet, and apparently unconscious;&#xD;
then she looked at us alternately; her mind wandered as she&#xD;
spoke. "He said, 'Shall I have the honor of helping you,&#xD;
Madam?'" Her voice was low and childlike.&#xD;
"Didn't he say that?" and she looked earnestly at inc.&#xD;
"Yes! I thought I shOuld die then; I knew that he hated&#xD;
me then; I knew I was ruined."&#xD;
"Hush, dear! you must keep very quiet!"&#xD;
"No! I can't keep quiet! Who are you? Oh! you're&#xD;
Kate! Then I wished I was dead; Ii wished I had never&#xD;
written that letter; II wished so, as soon as Josephine had&#xD;
given it to him, but I couldn't get it back! it was meant&#xD;
that I should make him hate me, I suppose. Oh, well!&#xD;
I don't care so much now! I'm happy enough now. Who&#xD;
is that sitting there ?"&#xD;
"Here, child, drink this water, and then you must not&#xD;

speak any more!" I said, raising he~ head from the pillow:&#xD;
she gazed up into my eyes with a l~ ok entirely docile and&#xD;
childlike. "Must I drink this?"&#xD;
"Yes!" She did so, and sunk upon her pillow quietly;&#xD;
she did not speak for a long time.&#xD;
"Where's the Empress Josephine?"&#xD;
"She has gone to bed."&#xD;
"My heart aches so for her; you know Napoleon often&#xD;
s~okc harshly to her. Do you remember ' one time, when they&#xD;
had been parted, she met him at some cit~-I don't reniem-&#xD;
ber what city-he treated her rudely; he did not even~ em-&#xD;
brace her. I know how she felt then. Oh, Ii am so warm!&#xD;
Fan me! She didn't care forhonors and kingdoms, did she?&#xD;
she was like me; she cared for love. She was better than&#xD;
II was, though; she was patient to the end. I awoke hard&#xD;
feelings in my husband's heart,-in John's heart! Isn't he&#xD;
my husband? Is he your husband?"&#xD;
"Mary," I answered, looking down in her appealing eyes,&#xD;
"the doctor would not allow you t9 talk so much!"&#xD;
"Wouldn't he? Give me a drink, and perhaps I can&#xD;
keep still 1"&#xD;
She remained quiet, with her eyes fixed upon her hus-&#xD;
band, until she fell asleep.; he had not changed his position,&#xD;
or made any sound. She was better at daybreak; the doc-&#xD;
tor came, and looked pleased. He said she would come back&#xD;
from the grave.&#xD;
Her convalescence was slow and tedious. At length,&#xD;
when a glorious M~y morning broke over/ the earth, the&#xD;
doctor said we might wheel her arm-chair into the parlor,&#xD;
and have her once more in our midst. He, however, advised&#xD;
us not to move her until afternoon, that the fatigue might&#xD;
insure a good night's rest. The children hastened to their&#xD;
flower-beds, and began to pluck all the loveliest flowelts to&#xD;
enliven the parlor.&#xD;

TIlE FLORAL RECEPTION.           118&#xD;
&#xD;
"We'll make it look perfectly beautiful!" exclaimed,&#xD;
Gertrude, beckoning to Walte~ 'a~d me. We went out on&#xD;
the back piazza, and seated our8elvCs to make bouquets and&#xD;
wreaths for the children's heads. Walter 'had more taste in&#xD;
arranging flowers than many ladies. The day before, James&#xD;
had been botanizing in the country; he brought home va-&#xD;
rious treasures for the children, a quantity of beautiful moss&#xD;
among other things. This moss Gertrude brought from the&#xD;
nursery and laid in my lap, with an entreating request that&#xD;
I would make vases, and a basket to hold flowers. So we&#xD;
went busily to work; between our chatting, I read occasion~&#xD;
ally from the paper upon which the moss lay. Upon looking&#xD;
over the arrivals, I read Mr. Benzoni's name. This I kept&#xD;
to myself, knowing that it would bring a cloud to Walter's&#xD;
brow, should he know it. He seemed quiet; kind, and&#xD;
cheerful.&#xD;
"Tell inc about the sister Josephine resembles," I said.&#xD;
"Is she pretty?"&#xD;
"I think ~ he replied, proudly; "she is more than&#xD;
pretty; she is, very beautiful!"&#xD;
"She probably looks like' you," T raid, laughing.&#xD;
"No !" she is very unlike me in appearance. I hope&#xD;
you may ~ee her some time; she is' only a half sister, but she&#xD;
could not be d&amp;amp;arer to me than she is."&#xD;
"Where is she now?"&#xD;
"She is teaching at the South. She has golden hair,&#xD;
Kate, a rose and lily complexion, and the sweetest eyes and&#xD;
mouth in the world."&#xD;
"Is she lovely in character?" I questioned.&#xD;
"She is," he answered with a smile, "Let me tell you&#xD;
a little incident about her, and you will believe it. Once&#xD;
when we were children we were caught out in the woods in a&#xD;
thunder shower; the wind blew furiously, and uprooted a&#xD;
tree n'ear which w~e stood; a branch struck us, and threw us&#xD;

&#xD;
both down; it gave me a blow upon the head that rendered&#xD;
me senseless. When I recovered, Effie, white as ashes, was&#xD;
leaning over me, trying to make me drink from a leaf which&#xD;
she had twisted into a drinking vessel, and ~i1led with water.&#xD;
She went backward and forward from a brook near, to bring&#xD;
me water a number of times. I noticed at length that she&#xD;
carried the leafy cup in her left hand; her trembling step&#xD;
and pallid lips frightened me.&#xD;
"'What's the matter, Effie 'V I asked, looking at the hand&#xD;
which hung motionless at her side.&#xD;
"'I think my right arm is broken!' she answered, tears&#xD;
gushing into her eyes for the first time. J3rave little Effie!&#xD;
She had not heeded herself while I seemed suffering. Her&#xD;
arm was in reality broken."&#xD;
"She was a noble little creature!~~ I said, looking into&#xD;
Walter's fine face, grown bright with generous feeling. II&#xD;
little dreamed under what circumstances it would be my&#xD;
fate to meet this beautiful Effie, this beloved sister of&#xD;
Walter's.&#xD;
Afternoon came; ore we drew Cousin Mary into the par-&#xD;
lor, we all went to take an admiring look at it; the golden&#xD;
sunshine played between the half-closed blinds, and fell upon&#xD;
the flowers gracing the window-sills; two moss baskets, fresh&#xD;
and green, were filled with sparkling minerals and shells; one&#xD;
was made of wood moss, and its pretty mosaic seemed just&#xD;
fitted for its glittering freight. On the mantelpiece two&#xD;
moss yases held the pet flowers of May: in the centre of the&#xD;
shelf stood a small temple of the same material, its slender&#xD;
white columns contrasting with its greenness. Grace and I&#xD;
had hung up sever~I of our latest pictures; they were with-&#xD;
out frames, but tI~ey would be new to the dear invalid.&#xD;
There was a crab-apple tree in the yard; its delicious bbs-&#xD;
soms scented the room~with fragrance.&#xD;
We drew Cousin Mary into the parlor; the children&#xD;
&#xD;
kissed her with joyous abandon, and bade her look and ad-&#xD;
mire. A broad gleam of light fell upon the flowery wreath&#xD;
and ringlets of Josephine~~ who dropped down at her mother's&#xD;
side, raising her eyes of heavenly tenderness to the beloved&#xD;
being for whom she had labored all day : Jijie white wings,&#xD;
her arms folded themselves upon her mother's knee.&#xD;
"My darlings look so kind I can scarcely look further!"&#xD;
said the happy mother, gazing upon the children, while grate-&#xD;
ful tears gathered in her dark eyes. She admired every&#xD;
thing we had done; the serene content that settled upon her&#xD;
countenance amply repaid us for our efforts.&#xD;
"We can never be poor, while we have such heart weMth&#xD;
around us!" she said, glancing at Grace and me with a&#xD;
tremulous smile. "Every thing bright seems suddenly to&#xD;
cluster around me,-love makes my home beautiful, at an&#xD;
hour II had looked forward to with anxiety. How true it is&#xD;
that 'evils that never happened have chiefly made us&#xD;
wretched.'"&#xD;
We settled ourselves down to our sewing. It seemed so&#xD;
blessed to know that the clouds had been removed from&#xD;
Cousin 1~Jary's life. Mr. IRodman had become "one of us."&#xD;
His stubborn nature had grown strong in self-control; he&#xD;
always spoke to the children with infinite tenderness, as if he&#xD;
would woo theit love; when he addressed his wife, his voice&#xD;
often took the low, indulgent tone so dear to a woman's heart.&#xD;
Often in her manner now, a sort of youthful sweetness and&#xD;
playfulness might be seen. It was altogether new to me, to&#xD;
see how winning and artless a warm nature could become&#xD;
under the heaven of affectionate eyes.&#xD;
"I hardly want to get entirely well, you all make such a&#xD;
queen of me!" Cousin Mary said, laughing. As she spoke,&#xD;
Mr. liodman came in from his business: he had obtained a&#xD;
clerkship. He looked at her with a smile that was half re-&#xD;
pressed in its pleased admiration.&#xD;

&#xD;
~' You look more like a bride than an invalid, Nary!"&#xD;
he said, glancing at her white wrapper, and little tasteful&#xD;
cap trimmed with pale pink ribbons. The latter was a&#xD;
present from Miss Cardover. "1 thought I must help the&#xD;
family to spoil you!" he continued, handing her a volume of&#xD;
poems by a favorite author. She looked up at hcr husband,&#xD;
and she was, beautiful; her smile of marvellous sweetness&#xD;
flashed an illumination over her face; a faint rose hue&#xD;
tinted her cheeks. She was radiant with love, and life, and&#xD;
h6pe.&#xD;
~' Thank you, John t" she said simply, and bent over the&#xD;
pages of, the book. Mr. IRodman cast side glances at her.&#xD;
The feelings of hi.&amp;amp;youth fell upon his heart like fresh spring&#xD;
blossoms, with his new aspirations after truth and goodness&#xD;
When Walter and James came in to tea, the latter&#xD;
looked upon the smiling countenance of Grace with a joyous&#xD;
cheerfulness; a sunny atmosphere bathed the whole house-&#xD;
hold.&#xD;
When the evening meal was over, Grace won ~ into the&#xD;
parlor, to gather up our sewing, and put the room in order.&#xD;
Jamesfollowed her, but Ii had not observed it. I entered&#xD;
the room quietly: he stood at her side, with one of her&#xD;
hands in his; she wa~ looking down, with an expression of&#xD;
great pain on her counten~nce, and his low voice was utter-&#xD;

"Oh, Grace, you cannot say it!"&#xD;
I stole softly from the x~oom.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
JUDITH MORTON sat alone! A sunset glory was lingering in&#xD;
the western sky; she sat watching it, evidently expecting&#xD;
some one; at length ~he lost herself in happy dreaming.&#xD;
She was startled from her musings by a quick, eager step&#xD;
on the pavement. it was not the step she was looking for,&#xD;
arid as it fell upon her ear, she could not keep down the&#xD;
w~ld threbbings of her passionate heart. She hastened to&#xD;
the door; she stood still, fearing disappointment, rallying&#xD;
back her self-command. She did not wish that the being&#xD;
best loved on earth, should learn the depths of her love, but&#xD;
she strove in vain for composure. The parlor door was&#xD;
thrown open without knocking, and Mr. Benzoni stood be-&#xD;
fore her; sh~ had ~not heard of his arrival in the city. A&#xD;
rapturous smile was upon his face; he had seen her from&#xD;
the street. She threw herself in his arms with weeping&#xD;
wild and joyful: she only looked up in his eyes, as he mur-&#xD;
mured,&#xD;
"Adored !-~---angel !-my life 1" and between each word his&#xD;
kisses were showered.&#xD;
"When did you come?" she whispered.&#xD;
"When shall you be all my own?" he replied, smiling&#xD;
down the love and happiness that overflowed his head. She&#xD;
did not answer. He continued, "It is heaven to be witb&#xD;

TILE TWO LOVERS.               119&#xD;
&#xD;
118                   LOVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
you after this long absence !-.-heaven to look within your&#xD;
beautiful eyes !-heaven to know that your heart is all my&#xD;
own! I never dreamed the earth held so sweet an. angel,&#xD;
and that she would give herself t~ me, and make me blest&#xD;
for ever. I never dreamed there could be ~a happiness so ec-&#xD;
static; I am not capable of more, for my heart's deepest re-.&#xD;
cesses tremble with this joy. Judith, do yo4 love inc even'&#xD;
better than when we parted?"&#xD;
She smiled her response, and disengaged herself. from his&#xD;
arms, that they might seat themselves on the sofa.~ "But&#xD;
tell me, Judith, with words, that you love me better?"&#xD;
"I do," she answered with downcast eyes; then she&#xD;
raised~ them suddenly, and their liquid sweetness told all the&#xD;
story: the bewitching smiles that dimpled her face could&#xD;
not be repressed. "It is my duty to love you more, if we&#xD;
are to 'be married soon," she said, her coquettish manner re-&#xD;
turning to her, "and I always fulfil my duties."&#xD;
The word duty, called Grace to Mr. Benzorii's memory.&#xD;
"Your neighbors are well, I suppose?" he asked.&#xD;
"Quite well," returned Judith. 11cr lover did not see&#xD;
the sudden cloud that overspread her face ~ the hard look&#xD;
that came about her mouth, and disappeared. A' mighty&#xD;
pang shot through her heart for a moment, a pang of jeal-&#xD;
ousy; she feared for the love she had stolen from another,&#xD;
feared for the permanence of this idolatry. In her guileful&#xD;
heart, there dwelt not the strong faith in others that springs&#xD;
from innocence. But the pang went by.&#xD;
"iii have'4ought awi~cient beautiful villa for us to live&#xD;
in," said Mr. Beuzoni; "I have filled it with luxuries suited&#xD;
to my princess. I' only care for the wealth I amassed in&#xD;
4his country, that I may lay at your feet every thing you can&#xD;
desire."&#xD;
"Shall we always live in Italy?"&#xD;
"Not after you get tired of it. A wish of yours will&#xD;
&#xD;
he like a pulse of my heart, not to be resisted, because I&#xD;
cannot ~ay nay. And you cannot say nay to me in any&#xD;
thing, can you, my bird?"&#xD;
"No, oh, no!" Judith spoke fervently. It is easy to&#xD;
be grateful' to those we' love, and a boundless love for each&#xD;
other welled up from their hearts. They could have sacri-&#xD;
ficed all exterior comforts for 'each other; they could have&#xD;
suffered, they could even have braved death for each other,&#xD;
but they could also have trodden bleeding human hearts&#xD;
into the dust for each other-they could have turned from&#xD;
a parent's tears and prayers; they could have cried to all&#xD;
the world, "Suffer, if so it must be, but let us be happy."&#xD;
A1~! that love should. ever be so fiendish, so lost to heavenly&#xD;

A carriage drove up to Mr. MQrtOn's. Judith's eafr&#xD;
caught the sound, and the crimson rose to her brow.&#xD;
She had momentarily forgotten an engagement with Mr. Car-&#xD;
dover. She hesitated, then started from Mr. Benzoni's side.&#xD;
But eager footsteps again hastened to her; the door was&#xD;
thrown open, and Mr. Cardover seized her hand; he raised&#xD;
it with mock gallantry to his lips, and then looked on 'her&#xD;
with a brilliant, joyful smile. "Are you ready to ride?"&#xD;
he asked, not perceiving Mr. Benzoni, who sat somewhat&#xD;
concealed by the door.&#xD;
"I cannot go! Excuse me! "she faltered, and then re-&#xD;
covering herself with a stately air, she bowed, "Good even-&#xD;
ing! I am engaged for the evening!"&#xD;
" What does this mean ?" demanded Mr. Cardover&#xD;
bluntly, stung by her manner, and bewildered by surprise at&#xD;
this change. His self-possession returned in a moment. He&#xD;

bowed a polite " Good evening !" and left her. He left her&#xD;
with the brightest dream that had ever come to lodge in his&#xD;
heart, all darkened-the brightest hopes that had ever sang&#xD;
in its silent chambers, all hushed. The black wing of dis-&#xD;
appointmnent drooped 'over him heavily, and shut out all&#xD;
"ihtHow is this, Judith ?" asked Mr. Benzoni, and his&#xD;
brow was so dark that her heart failed her ; a~ strange fear&#xD;
of him grsed it, and she could not speak. Suspicion was&#xD;
a powerful element in Mr. Benzoni's character.&#xD;
" How is this, Judith ?" he repeated, a fierce jealousy&#xD;
flashing from his eyes. " It seems I came a few days earlier&#xD;
than you expected me. It seems you favor other lovers in&#xD;
No! nceo!" she answered. " He is only a friend,-I&#xD;
was going to his sister's to spend the evening; she sent him&#xD;
for me." The lie came with difficulty from her lips.&#xD;
" You are not telling me the truth.! " said Mr. Benzoni&#xD;
from between his set teeth. A blackness seemed to settle&#xD;
over the girl's heart, as if the light of joy were going out for&#xD;
ever. Her blood was chilled, her face turned pale as death.&#xD;
This only confirmed the Italian in his suspicions.&#xD;
" Have you permitted that man's visits in my absence?"&#xD;
he questioned. -" Tell me the~ truth now, or we part for&#xD;
ever ! Speak !"&#xD;
She stood with her clasped hands dropped before her;&#xD;
her alarmed eyes riveted upon his face. " He has~ been&#xD;
here !" she said.&#xD;
" Has he ever spoken of love to you ?"&#xD;
"C He has never asked to be aught but a friend."&#xD;
Mr. Benzoni's lip curled with bitter scorn. " What need&#xD;
to ask?9 You knew of his love, and he knew it. I :saw it&#xD;
before I. went away. And he has played the lover ever&#xD;
since. You hesitate to namne the day of our marriage ; you&#xD;
&#xD;
h ae not decided between us yet, or you prefer to coquette&#xD;
.wit two whie you can. You mean to put me off as long&#xD;
as possible, and then, perhaps marry my fine villa-you will&#xD;
take me because I am the richest."&#xD;
"Oh1 , Giovanni V this from you !" She covered her face&#xD;
with her hands, and wept passionately. Her accent went to&#xD;
downw, Judith," he said ; "let us talk of this.  You&#xD;
Americans fear the Bible.". He wet to the tbleadto&#xD;
one h"tWill you swear on this Holy Book to tell me all the&#xD;
trtte whole truth, and nothing but the truth ?"  With.&#xD;
one hand he drew hers from her face.&#xD;
"Iwill swear, Giovannm !" and she reverently kissed the&#xD;
Holy Book, andi looked into his eyes with less fear.&#xD;
h'Did Cardover's sister send him for you, or did he come&#xD;
himsel to ride with you alone this evening?"&#xD;
"He came himself.&#xD;
"Then you told me a lie!"&#xD;
"Ys"she said, seeing the old love come in his eyes ;&#xD;
H' yuloed at me so terribly I was afraid of you."&#xD;
T "ow many times have you been out to ride with him? "&#xD;
"The whole truth, Judith."-&#xD;
"our times exactly."&#xD;
"You could not -love me entirely, and yet flirt with&#xD;
another whle under promise of marriage to me. Which of&#xD;
"You!" and a very slight smile played around her&#xD;
mouth; it was full of indescribable coquetry and mischief.&#xD;
From the moment she had gazed in his eyes she saw that he&#xD;
cul not- break from her side; she felt her power, and her&#xD;
trror subsided ito a wholesome fear. She saw the neces-.&#xD;
sy of speaking the whole truth.-&#xD;

"I didn't"&#xD;
"You certainly did. Why did you encourage his atten-&#xD;
tions?"&#xD;
I "I don't know."&#xD;
"You knew it was a wrong to me?"&#xD;
"IL thought you'd forgive me if you ever found it out."&#xD;
A ~aardIy perceptible smile passed over Mr. IBenzoni's face.&#xD;
Sh~ spoke with such a childlike air, and looked like such a&#xD;
sweet, irresponsible little charmer, that he could not find it'&#xD;
in his heart to chide her more. 'She continued looking&#xD;
down, marking letters on the cover of the Bible with a pin.&#xD;
"Are you going to flirt this way after we are married,&#xD;
Judith?"&#xD;
"Will you let me? I'll do as you think best."&#xD;
"I imagine IL shall not let you. Tell me now that you&#xD;
are very sorry for your bad conduct, and give me twenty&#xD;
kisses."&#xD;
"I shall not."&#xD;
"What! what!"&#xD;
"Tell me first that you will never frighten me so again.&#xD;
Never! as long as you live. IL don't want ~to be afraid of&#xD;
you, when you are aiy husband. I won't marry you, if you&#xD;
are going to terrify me to death, and 'make me 'cry every&#xD;
'day."&#xD;
"Did IL terrify you so, sweet child?"&#xD;
The quarrel ~yas made up. Their love and joy seemed&#xD;
perfect. But far back in the quiet, unheeded depths of their&#xD;
hearts a new knowledge was garnered; a new fear of each&#xD;
other slept there, but slept lightly, ready to' be awakened&#xD;
upon occasion. Judith had been startled by the vindictive&#xD;
and suspicious glances that flashed from her lover's eyes, and&#xD;
over the now closed door in her spirit she wrote, "In future&#xD;
be cautious before him."&#xD;
"Over the same silent door in his heart the Italian&#xD;
&#xD;
128&#xD;
wrote, unconsciously, "Watch\! " Through his mind the&#xD;
figure of Grace floated, and if she was not beguiling as the.&#xD;
new' charmer, she wore a robe of innocence, and her smile&#xD;
was guileless as an infant's. There was too much of Pu-&#xD;
rity and heaven about her to seduce wholly a heart that had&#xD;
no leaning towards such things.&#xD;
lit was the day before Judith's marriage. She sat in her&#xD;
own room, half buried amid laces, silks, velvets and em-&#xD;
broideries. It was early morning, and the dressmakers had&#xD;
not yet arrived to put the finishing touches upon her apparel.&#xD;
She looked out of the windoW, and saw Grace training some&#xD;
vines over a trellis. 'K[ wish that girl was dead!" she&#xD;
mused. "Wretch! IL hate her! IL could kill her! Gio-&#xD;
vanni loves me IL know; but he has loved her, and IL wish she&#xD;
did not number the earth. ~EIIer sanctimoniousness will al-&#xD;
ways come to his mind, whenever I show any human imper-&#xD;
fection. Thank fortune, she has not beauty like mine! She&#xD;
looks jale, and more slender than she did. IL hope she will&#xD;
fall into a hopeless consumption. Well! I may as well turn&#xD;
to more pleasant thoughts. I may as well remember how&#xD;
fortunate and happy I am. Father is pleased enough at the&#xD;
idea of my marriage. IL do not believe there is a woman&#xD;
upon earth happier than I am. My noble Giovanni!"&#xD;
Airs. Morton's entrance interrupted her daughter's cogita-&#xD;
* tions. She was a pale, delicate woman, whom Frai~ik strongly&#xD;
resembled, but she did not possess his off-hand frankness.&#xD;
She was timid in her air, even in entering the chamber of her&#xD;
own child.&#xD;
"ILTow do you get along with your work, Judith? Can&#xD;
you get every thing done to-day?" she asked.&#xD;
"Of course can!"&#xD;
"But here is still an immense deal of sewing. Those&#xD;
poor girls will have to sit up all night to finish it."&#xD;

"What if they do? it won't hurt them!"&#xD;
"Why here, Judith. These two dresses might be left&#xD;
until you get to Europe; they are so heavy you will not&#xD;
need them at all."&#xD;
"But I have a notion that I shall have them made, for&#xD;
all that."&#xD;
"One more day, my child, then we shall be parted!"&#xD;
Tears forced themselves into the mother's eyes.&#xD;
'~Yes, that is the way the world goes. Where is that&#xD;

"You will write often, dear; won't you?"&#xD;
~C Oh, yes, mother; you need ndt feel so badly about it.&#xD;

"But oceans do not always roll between parents and&#xD;

"Ah, yes. I h~ve known lovers often to make such&#xD;

"Well, Giovanni~ is not one of that sort."&#xD;
"So all young girls think of their lovers. You will&#xD;
find, my poor Judith, that men are not like women; they&#xD;
think of their own comfort first, and their wives second."&#xD;
"Lord! mother, don't talk in that strain. All men are&#xD;
not alike. II acknowledge that father makes your comfort a&#xD;
very secondary thing. But the man that imagines he can&#xD;
impose on me in like manner, will fiud himself mistaken."&#xD;
"I know that your disposition is very different from&#xD;
mine. But, oh dear! Pm so miserable! Oh; Judith! how&#xD;
I wish you loved me, as some girls love their mothers!"&#xD;
"Why, I do love you, mother."&#xD;
"Yes, perhaps so. When you were born, Judith, Ii was&#xD;
the happiest of human beings. I worshipped you; I never&#xD;

CURIOUS FOREBODINGS.          125&#xD;
&#xD;

soul. And do you love me, Judith?"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, mother." Tears rose in her eyes, and she&#xD;
kissed tenderly the pale face before her.&#xD;
"Oh, Judith! how I wisili it were in my power to shield&#xD;
you from all suffering. I wish Mr. Benzoni were a Chris-&#xD;
tian. I am not one myself, neither is your father, but men&#xD;
are not to be trusted, unless they have strong principles."&#xD;
Judith turned pale, but she answered,&#xD;
"If Mr. Benzoni had been a Christian, he would proba-&#xD;
bly never have bee~t your son-in-law, He would have re-&#xD;
inained tiedi to Grace i~'ercival, whether he loved her or&#xD;
not."&#xD;
"If he had been a Christian, his affections would not&#xD;
have wandered from her."&#xD;
Judith's face grew still more pale with dread of the fu-&#xD;
ture-her own coquettish nature led her to believe that con-&#xD;
stancy was a rare thing in man or woman. Mrs. Norton&#xD;
sobbed in silence; every few moments she roused herself to&#xD;
say-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, dear! girls would never marry, if they knew. when&#xD;
they were well off! Never, never! Oh, dear!"&#xD;
Judith stitched away impatiently, while a miserable fever&#xD;
of anxiety stirred in her heart. Mrs. Morton broke forth&#xD;
again:&#xD;
"Whenever I go to a wedding, it seems more gloomy to&#xD;
me than a funeral."&#xD;
"Well, another,' II should think you had said enough,&#xD;
without bringing up that old woman's stereotype speech. ft&#xD;
is very natural that some anxieties should mingle with my&#xD;
happiness. You ought to cheer me, instead of showing me&#xD;
the dark side. A bride always has heavy fears when she&#xD;
takes this irrevocable step, even if her husband is the most&#xD;
devoted man in the world. She may be leaving her buoy-&#xD;

"II hope you may."&#xD;
here a voice sounded along the stairway.&#xD;
"Come down from your nest, little birdie."&#xD;
A joyful flush ovei~spread Judith's face at the familiar&#xD;
voice~ and she bounded from the room, while her mother was&#xD;
uttering,&#xD;
"Now, Judith, you're not going to talk nonsense two or&#xD;
three hours, when there is so much to do? Why don't Mr.&#xD;
Beuzoni come at sunrise? 110 is here all the time.&#xD;
"Mother is sQolding me for leaving my, work," laughed&#xD;
the bride elect, as she met her lover.&#xD;
"Scolding you, is she?" he smilingly returned. "How&#xD;
could any one scold such a little angel? What work have&#xD;
you to do? These little hands were not made to work. II&#xD;
want you to take a horseback ride with me. Will you get&#xD;
ready? Wear your velvet riding hat. You look superbly&#xD;
in that, with your ringlets waving down. I have the horses&#xD;

CHAPTER Xlv.&#xD;
&#xD;
FRANK MORTON, in the innocence of ignorance, had men-&#xD;
tioned to us the day that Judith was to be married. Then&#xD;
lie carelessly turned to Josephine, and said, "Move, Josey, it&#xD;
is your turn." They were sitting by the window, playing.&#xD;
checquers; lie had no dream of the emotions he had sent into&#xD;
the heart of Grace. After that day, whenever she raised&#xD;
her eyes, they looked as if an inward conflict was going on&#xD;
within her. She was torn by contending spirits. How&#xD;
could she bow her neck and say, "Forgive us our trespasses&#xD;
as we forgive those who trespass against us."&#xD;
And now the day for the marriage had arrived. She&#xD;
was pale and quiet, but when I looked within her haggard&#xD;
eyes, T saw that the angel of peace tarried on his way to her.&#xD;
lii the afternoon she said, "Where did Walter put the key&#xD;
of the church? I will go and play on the organ."&#xD;
Ii found her the key, secretly delighted that she would&#xD;
nK; be at home to see the young bride leave with her gay&#xD;
friends for the church, where she was to be wedded, The&#xD;
two churches were not very far apart. 0-race left us, and&#xD;
then Cousin Mary and I talked freely and sadly about her.&#xD;
A restless feeling possessed me as I thought of all that was&#xD;
going on, and I thirsted to get into the open air, where I&#xD;
&#xD;

128             A PRIVATE WEDDING.                                                   THE CEREMONY.               129&#xD;
&#xD;
should not hear the low muffled tread of Thet in the adjoin-&#xD;
ing house; it fell upon my nerves almost as uneasily as if&#xD;
Grace were present to hear it.&#xD;
I rolled up a little painting, and prepared for a walk to&#xD;
Mr. Cardover's store. I did not wish to see him on this&#xD;
day, but I could think of no other errand that would take&#xD;
me out of doors. He was usually hack in the store, and sel-&#xD;
dom came forward except to meet an acquaintance.&#xD;
I ventured forth, and slowly pursued my way through&#xD;
the thronged streets; it was the hour for men to turn home-&#xD;
ward from their business,' although the summer sun had not&#xD;
descended to its rest. I reached the store, and glided in.&#xD;
Only a tall young man stood near the door.&#xD;
"There,"" said I, bowing and smiling, and laying in his&#xD;
hand niy picture; then I turned to go out.&#xD;
"Miss Hamilton, won't you see -.&#xD;
"Not to-day; I am in a hurry," I replied, interrupting&#xD;
him, and. I went on my way. I heard a city clock strike.&#xD;
It was the wedding hour. A fitting time it was t~ pro-&#xD;
nounce vow~ solemn and hopeful. The lingering sun had&#xD;
disappeared,\ but the heavens were bathed in a golden splen-&#xD;
dor where it~ had just shone. The long shadows fell dream-&#xD;
ily upon th~ pavements; the quick tread of home-seeking&#xD;
workmen had died away; only quiet steps sounded upon the&#xD;
street. Occasionally, cheery shouts from boys who were&#xD;
playing a dearly loved game, broke upon my ear. I drew&#xD;
near a fine Gothic church; it stood in the softened. light, with&#xD;
half open doors, as if 'inviting my entrance. I dropped my&#xD;
veil, and wondered if I should steal in and behold the beau-&#xD;
tiful bride; or pass on. I knew by the low, then triumphal&#xD;
tones of the organ, that the marriage party had. arrived. I&#xD;
went in very quietly, and took a seat away from the light,&#xD;
where Ii was shaded by a pillar. It was designed. to ~be a&#xD;
very private wedding, therefore the 'church was not wholly&#xD;
&#xD;
lit. Around the altar and down the middle aisle a blaze&#xD;
of lamps shed, their brilliance. The bridal party stood at&#xD;
the altar; it consisted only of Judith and Mr. Benzoni, with&#xD;
a dozen intimate friends or relatives. The bride and groom&#xD;
looked glorious in beauty, glorious in happiness; the eyes of&#xD;
Judith were bent down; upon her cheeks roses of love had&#xD;
pressed their' sweetness;' the dew of bliss rested upon her&#xD;
warm lips. Her snowy dress seemed airy and transparent;&#xD;
a wreath of orange flowers crowned her, and a veil of illu-&#xD;
sion lace waved around her, giving to her whole figure the&#xD;
aerial grace we attach to the presence ~of an angel. Well'&#xD;
might her lover's heart swell triumphantly as her white-&#xD;
gloved hand rested on his arm, for she was matchless in her&#xD;
dower of brilliance' and beauty. Well might he exult, for&#xD;
he had now what he most prized in woman, physical beauty,&#xD;
fascination of manner, and graceful wit. Almost at this mo-&#xD;
ment might ,he see~n excused for loving her, inasmuch as&#xD;
these things are precious in woman, costly gifts from the&#xD;
Creator. Fancy might have invested him with a sort of&#xD;
heroic splendor, as he bowed himself 'over the hand of his&#xD;
beloved, and kissed it. Even here his jealousy set the ex-&#xD;
ample; it would not have pleased him that gentlemen should&#xD;
kiss her cheek, even' though they were relatives. The cere-&#xD;
mony was nearly completed as I entered the church. They&#xD;
stood amid the blaze of lamps; in their joy they thought&#xD;
not of the exultation of a father's heart, the regret of a&#xD;
mother's. Did they dream of another sweet, breaking heart&#xD;
gazing out from eyes so haggard? Pooi-, crouching 'heart!&#xD;
it shrunk away amid shadows that seemed everlasting !.-&#xD;
with all its wealth, it kneeled before a. redeeming God, and&#xD;
prayed for a cup of water only to allay its anguish !-~pr~ycd&#xD;
to sleep in its terrible povert5r, sleep only!&#xD;
I looked on the beautiful and exultant ones. A blessing&#xD;
had just sounded from the lips of the holy man; a blessing&#xD;

on them-it had sounded through the aisles, it had sounded&#xD;
through the galleries; it had tre~iubled through a mother's&#xD;
listening heart. But had the blessing of him whose name&#xD;
is Love, descended into their selfish heaven? Had they not&#xD;
~seized forbidden fruit? Had they ever heard the words,&#xD;
"To him that overcorneth will I give to eat of the tree of&#xD;
life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God?"&#xD;
Happy voices spoke their congratulations; sweet rejoic-&#xD;
ing laughter came to my ears; the rich tones of the bride-&#xD;
groom reached me, rich and dulcet with pure joy, and then&#xD;
floated towards me clearer music from the lips of the love-&#xD;
beaming bride. Above all this, the organ poured its soft&#xD;
notes of gratulation. 'I. stole softly from the church, ere the&#xD;
bridal party started down the aisle.&#xD;
I concluded to go to our own church before I went home,&#xD;
to see if Grace were still there. A bright twilight pervaded&#xD;
the vestry room as I opened the door and enP~red; the or-&#xD;
gan was hushed. I looked within the main body of the&#xD;
building. Grace was kneeling before the altar, with her face&#xD;
buried in her hands; her broken sobs and prayers went quiv-&#xD;
ering from her lips.&#xD;
"0 niy Father," broke low from her, "thou hast taken&#xD;
from my hand the. flowers of youth and gladness. Teach&#xD;
me now self-renunciation, that they may be restored to me&#xD;
in thine upper kingdom. Teach me forgiveness, that I may&#xD;
give balm to other souls. Teach me to feel that my destiny&#xD;
may be more sublime for this suffering. Help them~ to walk&#xD;
with Thee." As if soothed }~y the words she had uttered,&#xD;
she remained quiet, i~ith her face still bowed upon her&#xD;
hands. II stole noiselessly to the farther part of the vestry&#xD;
room, and looked out of the windoW, waiting until she should&#xD;
be ready to go. I could not interrupt her holy ~prayers.&#xD;
The gray shadows of evening came down; the moon arose&#xD;
and flooded the room where I sat with a still serenity in&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
its calm light Ii drooped my face upon the window-sill, and&#xD;
prayed. that peace might flow into the sorr6wful soul near&#xD;
me.&#xD;
I heard Grace 4se from the altar. I rose, and ~ct her&#xD;
as she came in the vestry room.&#xD;
"I thought, darling," I said, taking her hand, "I would&#xD;
conic for you. I have been down town."&#xD;
"Have you? I thank you, Kate. I did not think it&#xD;
was so late; " and she looked at the moOn through the&#xD;
window. As her face was turned towards it, I saw from its&#xD;
serene exPression that God had sent down his angel to&#xD;
strengthen her when her renunciation was complete. A&#xD;
clear, sparkling jewel ~v~is set in her spirit's crown that&#xD;
night; she saw it not in all its radiance, for the soul's morn-&#xD;
ing twilight encompassed her, although the night was past.&#xD;
She clasped both arms around me, and kissed me with ~i&#xD;
calm fervorI saying, "You have often strengthened me,&#xD;
Kate. I think I shall be sustained now by the arm of the&#xD;
Most High. Forgive me that I haA~e added so little to your&#xD;
happiness lately. I need the forgiveness of all-they have&#xD;
all been so patient with me. Some angel seems to assure&#xD;
me that my sorrow may shower 'blessings upon other hearts&#xD;
-not now altogether; but it may run like a holy thing&#xD;
through my life, and may distil words of love and cheer to&#xD;
the hopeless~I pray that it may remind me at every step&#xD;
to drop seeds of grace and truth by the way, then it will&#xD;
bless me. Shall we go, dear?"&#xD;
As we emerged into the street, a miserably clad beggar&#xD;
girl approached us and asked alms. We had nothing to&#xD;
give her.&#xD;
Do you be~ every day, my poor girl ?" asked Grace.&#xD;
"Yes ma'am," returned the girl; "I can't help it-I&#xD;
hadn't got any relations, and the woman that keeps me says&#xD;

"II think she does. Are you thinking of her as maid of&#xD;

"Shall we venture to take her home, Kate?" Grace&#xD;
looked at me eagerly.&#xD;
"Perhaps she had better go to her own home to-night,&#xD;
and endeavor to wash and beautify a little before Cousin&#xD;
Mary sees her; she is very neat, you know."&#xD;
"Yes, perhaps that would be ~ We both gave&#xD;
the girl considerable instruction in regard to bettering her&#xD;
personal appearance. She was delighted at the prospect of&#xD;
living with us, although we told her Mrs. Rodman was a&#xD;
very particular woman, and would not keep her unless she&#xD;
did just as she told her.&#xD;
*" I'll try! II2'll try with all my might!" she answered&#xD;
with an honest, eager smile. "May I walk behind you to&#xD;
see where you live, s~ I can find it in the morning?"&#xD;
We gave our consent, and laid plans for instructing her&#xD;
as we walked along. Our meeting with her seemed one of&#xD;
those sweet, humble providonces that so often befall us at&#xD;
the time they are needed. I thought when we reached&#xD;
home, and saw carriages standing before Mr. Morton's house,&#xD;
they gave Grace a lighter pang, because she could turn to&#xD;
the beggar girl and say,&#xD;
"Good-bye, my child; come to-morrow," in a tone of&#xD;
&#xD;
such sweet gentleness; her heart leaned upon contemplated&#xD;
kindness to that little outcast.&#xD;
With the morrow came Mary MeConkey! She looked&#xD;
so radiant and delighted through her clean, whiningg face,&#xD;
that Cousin Mary's heart was taken forthwith. She was in-&#xD;
stalled into the family affections with enthusiasm. Gertrude&#xD;
and Josephine were quite overcome with admiration of h~r&#xD;
good nature and willingness to work, while they were steepe~i&#xD;
in pity for her past forlorn condition. They uttered a gre~t&#xD;
many "ohs" and "ahs," as they drew from her her history ,&#xD;
and were perpetually flitting from her to us, to relate som~&#xD;
incident in her life. Gertrude had calmly undertaken th~&#xD;
education of the damsel, and proposed to lead her as far as&#xD;
astronomy and French, in the full conviction that she would&#xD;
make a superior person, and would probably marry a rich&#xD;
man and live in great splendor. We allowed her to indulge&#xD;
her innocent ~nd cordial hopes, believing time would prove&#xD;
her protege to be only an Irish girl of ordinary capacity&#xD;
and great good nature.&#xD;
Home grew bright and peaceful. A new sunny atmos-&#xD;
phere encircled it; every face was tranquil. Poor James&#xD;
had left the city on business a day or two after Grace had&#xD;
rejected him. lie did not propose returning under a month.&#xD;

CHAPTEII XV&#xD;
A YEAR had flown. Judith Benzoni sat in her fair Italian&#xD;
home, and gazed out 'from her window into the garden of the&#xD;
villa, where little fountains played, and threw up freshening&#xD;
jets 'of water; rich and sweet-smelling flowers perfumed the&#xD;
air, goldened by the declining sun; bright rays brightened&#xD;
up the graceful statues which were relieved' by deep green&#xD;
foliage in the background. Beyond, the river Tiber flowed,&#xD;
and reflected the sunset brilliance, and shadowed' the trees&#xD;
in the water. Here and there, an old and broken ruin hal-&#xD;
lowed the scene with memories of the past. But the idle&#xD;
heart of the American woman cared not to live in the olden&#xD;
days. Her enthusiasm for iRome had gone by; ruins were&#xD;
a bore. The interior of her beautiful home, which she had&#xD;
taken such delight in arranging~ with Oriental luxury and&#xD;
modern extravagance, no longer captivated her 'thoughts.&#xD;
She glanced around the apartment in which she sat, with a&#xD;
half curved lip, as if she said to herself, "Very handsome,&#xD;
nothing could be more voluptuous or in better taste, but&#xD;
what of it? These fine things add to one's satisfaction,&#xD;
please one's vanity, but they fill no void in the heart." Was&#xD;
there already a void in Judith's heart? Not particularly,&#xD;
only she felt like most persons without an aim in life, and&#xD;
with much idle time on hand. She was dissatisfied that she&#xD;
&#xD;
was not happy every instant-that she grew tired of this&#xD;
and 'that. She was very happily married, ~he said, within&#xD;
herself, but it was so tiresome never to dress and beautify&#xD;
except for Giovanni. Sh6 loved him beyond expression,&#xD;
she was sure, but it was so dismal to think the excitement&#xD;
of coquetting was all over to think she must settle down&#xD;
and be as staid and serious as if she were fifty. She never&#xD;
could look at a man that Giovanni's great black eyes were&#xD;
not upon her, scrutinizing her deportment. What harm was&#xD;
there in being admired? She wanted nothing more than&#xD;
admiration. True, she should like to be a Laura to ~some&#xD;
gifted Petrarch; still she would make it a point to sail&#xD;
above his head, even more majestically than Laura did.&#xD;
She never ~would have an idol but Giovanni, and yet Gio-&#xD;
vanni had after all turned out rather more human than she&#xD;
had anticipated. He found fault with his dinner sometimes;&#xD;
yawned in her company, stretched out his feet, and wondered&#xD;
where, he should ge next; often inquired with energy, if she&#xD;
could not say something to amuse a fellow. At such times&#xD;
the fair Judith almost regretted that she had taken him upon&#xD;
her hands; it required one of his Iits of adoration to: assure&#xD;
her that she had not made a rash journey to Italy. A slight&#xD;
sound brought a warm glow to Judith's cheek, and replaced&#xD;
her idle thoughts with purer ones. An inner door softly&#xD;
opened and a nurse entered, bearing in her arms a young&#xD;
infant. Judith started up to receive it, and covered it with&#xD;
eager kisses.&#xD;
"My beautiful! my darling!" she uttered, gazing down&#xD;
with the softest love-light in her eyes. "Fresh as the morn-&#xD;
ing, my baby!" She played with the little one, and her&#xD;
sweet, murmuring tones broke forth fron~ the purest fount&#xD;
in her being. The Italian nurse looked on with smiling&#xD;
pride and fondness. Mr. Benzoni entered; he~ gazed with&#xD;
tenderness upon the radiant face of Judith, as ~he held&#xD;

forth her child for him to kiss, and then lifted up her laugh-&#xD;
ing mouth, saying as she did so, "0, Giovanni, you should&#xD;
have seen how this baby laughed! I worship this child. I&#xD;
never could have believed that I could have loved an infant&#xD;
so. I used to hate the very sight of them. I never could&#xD;
love this so well if it were not my own."&#xD;
"Not even if you took care of it night and day, mad-&#xD;
am?" questioned the nurse.&#xD;
"No!" said Judith. She spoke truly, for it was not ill&#xD;
her selfish nature to love for love's dear sake, for pity's sake.&#xD;
The child began to fret and cry.&#xD;
"Take her, Marie," said the young mother, With a per-&#xD;
plexed look. The woman tenderly held the little one to her&#xD;
heart, as she went from the room.&#xD;
"Giovanni," said Judith lightly, "I am going to make&#xD;
it a rule never to see that child when she is cross. I am&#xD;
only going to have pleasure and sunshine connected with&#xD;
my idea of her. If there is any thing that robs life of po-&#xD;
etry it is a squalling child." Judith smilingly seated her-&#xD;
self upon her husband's knee, and placing her pretty palm&#xD;
under his chin, bade him look out upbn the sunset.&#xD;
"It is very beautiful, my love," he answered. After a&#xD;
pause he added, "I think you must forget that even you&#xD;
yourself must sometimes have been cross, and have required&#xD;
a mother's care."&#xD;
"Oh, yes! but do you suppose I am going to sacrifice&#xD;
my sensibilities every time the baby cries, when the nurse&#xD;
understands what ails her so much better than I do? I&#xD;
love my child, but I have no idea of castingg my youth and&#xD;
beauty as a nursery drudge." /&#xD;
"You are very conscious of your beauty, Judith."&#xD;
"Yes, I am t" ~he smiled.&#xD;
"I should prize it more, if you prized it less."&#xD;
"You taught me to value it. You and a dozen other&#xD;
&#xD;
j&#xD;
&#xD;
gentlemen. You flatter us before marriage; you do your&#xD;
best to instil into our minds the idea that we monopolize&#xD;
every~ perfection, and when we at last are convinced that we&#xD;
possess a few graces, you are shocked that we believe it."&#xD;
." I do not wish that you should ~sacrifice your youth or&#xD;
beauty in unnecessary cares, but you never look lovelier to&#xD;
me than when you have our child in your arms."&#xD;
"You like to see me hold her when she is screaming, do~&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"T like to see you try to soothe her."&#xD;
"Yes! that all sounds very well. ~But, I happen to re-&#xD;
member your stopping your ears the other morning, and be-&#xD;
seeching me to hand over that 'miserable. little being' to&#xD;
Marie, when I was really trying to quiet her in the most&#xD;
motherly manner. Now, Giovanni, look me right in the&#xD;
eyes, because I want to tell you a peculiarity of yours. You&#xD;
are very apt to blame me for the very things you indulge&#xD;
yourself in. Ii could name a number of things set down in&#xD;
my memory, but I'll let you go this time." Judith spoke&#xD;
playfully, but she rose and sat by the wiiidow, leaning out a&#xD;
little, and shading her face with her hand to conceal its&#xD;
moodiness.&#xD;
"What do you refer to, Judith? What have you got&#xD;
set down in your memory against me?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothing!"&#xD;
" Yes, tell me&#xD;
"Well, for one thing! No one loves entire freedom&#xD;
better than you do. You do not even like to have me ask&#xD;
you where you have been, and what you have been doing,&#xD;
sometimes. But you do not like to have me go any where&#xD;
without your consent; and when we 4re in company, you&#xD;
direct me as though I were a child. Yo~i call the carriage,&#xD;

ested, and forbid my acquaintance with persons who seek&#xD;
miiie, and whom our friends can find no objection to. I do&#xD;
not mean to find fault," she continued, noticing a deep flush&#xD;
and a dark look upon her husband's face, "but Giovanni,&#xD;
you might give me a little more freedom. American hus-&#xD;
bands are not afraid to trust their wives."&#xD;
"You do not understand the difference between this&#xD;
country and yours,-the men and women are different,-.the&#xD;
manners are different. I have seen more of the world than&#xD;
you have.''&#xD;
"But you used to say, Giovanni, that you should always&#xD;
let me do as I pleased. IL do not want to do any thing wrong,&#xD;
but I want you to say, 'Do ~o and so, if you wish,' instead&#xD;
of almost forcing~ me to submit to your way."&#xD;
"Then you consider me a tyrant?"&#xD;
"Oh, no; far from it. You are the most itidulgent of men&#xD;
in most respects."&#xD;
The conversation dropped; each party occasionally stole&#xD;
a glance at the other. Mr. Benzoni at last exclaimed sud-&#xD;
denly, " Oh! here are letters from America.~~&#xD;
"Give theni to me," said Judith, with an animated smile,&#xD;
as she stretched out her hand. She was soon engrossed in&#xD;
their contents.&#xD;
"Well, what news?" demanded her husband, as she&#xD;
looked up after perusing them. "Is that last letter from&#xD;
your mother?"&#xD;
"Yes; shall I read it for you? There is nothing very&#xD;
striking in it."&#xD;
"Read on."&#xD;
And Judith read:&#xD;
"Mv DEAREST CmLD,...-You know how I hate to write let-&#xD;
ters: II would not write to anybody but you. I even make&#xD;
Frank write to your father in my place. You ought to see&#xD;
Frank. I am so proud of him; he grows so handsome, and&#xD;
&#xD;
he is very intellectual, I can assure you. He has been spoilt&#xD;
in his bringing up, in a measure; but he has a noble nature,&#xD;
for all that. He is very different from your . Well, I&#xD;
won't say it. I always believe in being prudent. How is&#xD;
Mr. Benzoni? Is he as kind as he was at first? I hope he&#xD;
i~, from the bottom of my heart. When are yo~ coming&#xD;
home to make a~ visit? I was so delighted to hear that you&#xD;
have a fine baby, and that you are getting along so nicely.&#xD;
Now, Judith, f hope you will try to be a good mother,-to&#xD;
instil good principles into your child. Is Mr. Benzoni fond&#xD;
of the baby? There is very little news to write. Walter&#xD;
Gray has become heir to a fortune through a rich old uncle.&#xD;
He is travelling in Europe now. Ii told him that he must be&#xD;
sure to visit you if he was in your quarter of the world. He&#xD;
saidhe would. That Mr. Bedell, whom you used to make&#xD;
so much fun of, has become quite a genteel young man: they&#xD;
say he is a treat student. Frank says he wanted Grace Per-&#xD;
cival, but she would not have him. She does not seem to&#xD;
have any beaux. There is a Mr. Waldron who goes there&#xD;
once in a while. You inquired about her, so I asked Josy&#xD;
if her aunt Grace was going to be married. I do not think&#xD;
she is unhappy; she always seems cheerful, although she has&#xD;
not the bright look she used to have. The IRodmans seem&#xD;
to be getting along quite comfortably. I hope Grace will&#xD;
get a good husband some of these days, if she ever does&#xD;
marry. But you know my opinion. I think it better to&#xD;
remain single, whenever a woman has pecuniary means.&#xD;
Give my love to Mr. Bonzoni. Your father sends a great&#xD;
deal of love, Frank too. Write very soon. I am sure you&#xD;
would write oftener, if you knew how glad I am to get your&#xD;
letter&amp;amp;&#xD;

140           FITs OF JEALOUSY.&#xD;
&#xD;
When Judith had reached the name of Grace her color&#xD;
had heightened, but she had kept on in the same quiet tone.&#xD;
As she laid the letter aside, she fixed a keen glance upon her&#xD;
husband's face, which was turned towards ~he window. "I&#xD;
wonder if Grace will marry that Waidron," said Mr.' Benzoni.&#xD;
"She is good girl."'&#xD;
"You thought, at one time, there was too much milk and&#xD;
water about her," said Judith.&#xD;
"Oh, yes," responded Benzoni. "' You and I arc far bet~&#xD;
ter suited. I never loved her as I loved you, Judith."&#xD;
The wife noticed that he said loved instead of love, and&#xD;
bitter thoughts gathered about her.&#xD;
"Would you like to visit America soon ?" inquired Gio-&#xD;
vanni.&#xD;
"The baby is too young. We had better not think of it&#xD;
at present."&#xD;
Giovanni whistled, and soon after left the room. Judith&#xD;
leaned her face upon the broad, window seat, and murmured,&#xD;
"I wish he were less like me. Grace uiight 'captivate him&#xD;
yet, were they to meet. It would be a rich revenge for 1~ier.'&#xD;
Sometimes the dreadful thought that he is tired of me, comes&#xD;
across me. I never know how deeply my happiness is bound&#xD;
up in him, until some jealous thought of Grace convinces me&#xD;
of it. I know that I am wilful 1and exacting, and often pout&#xD;
for hours when I am displeased. Once he said that Grace&#xD;
had a very different disposition from mine. Ah well! mar-&#xD;
riages always become tame affairs. Love does not survive&#xD;
matrimony more than a year or two at most. I must learn&#xD;
to amuse myself ~s I can. I must learn not to depend on&#xD;
him for happiness."&#xD;
An hour~or tw~ went slowly by; the wife was studying&#xD;
how to do without her husband's affection, rather than how&#xD;
to retain it. Her head was still bowed in thought, when the&#xD;
sweet tones of a flute were borne to her ear. She started, a~&#xD;
&#xD;
WALTER GREY.&#xD;
&#xD;
she recognized a familiar ~air; a smile stole to her lips as she&#xD;
repeated half disdainfully, "Walter Gray;' this beautiful land&#xD;
has awakened his romance again." She listened quietly un-&#xD;
til the music ceased; she half expected to see the musician&#xD;
ushered into her room. Ere long, her husband returned,&#xD;
bringing Mr. 0 ray with him, who extended his hand to Ju-&#xD;
dith with frank cordiality.&#xD;
"I have been playing under your window, Mrs. ]3enzoni,"&#xD;
he exclaimed, "trying to recall thoughts 'of your native land.&#xD;
'Did you guess who it was?"&#xD;
"Yes; Ii had learned through my mother that you were&#xD;
in Ttaly."&#xD;
"Ah, this beautiful Italy! I fear I never shall be able to&#xD;
leave it. I have been perfectly happy since I have been here.&#xD;
Shall you ever return to America to live, Mr. Benzoni?"&#xD;
"Perhaps I may. We are well suited here at present,&#xD;
however."&#xD;
Mr. Gray talked with a freedom and zest th'at assured&#xD;
Mrs. Benzoni that no fatal effects had resulted from his love-&#xD;
disappbintment. The gentlemanly ease of his manner, his&#xD;
frank, cheerful eyes, and cordial laugh piqued her vanity.&#xD;
She h~d expected to see him pining in true Byronic style:&#xD;
she made herself as fascinating as lay in her power; ere Wal-&#xD;
ter Gray left, his eyes sought her face often, to marvel at her&#xD;
bewildering beauty: he caught every witchery of her manner,&#xD;
and thought a laugh so sweet and joyous had neVer reached&#xD;
his ears. Judith noticed without dissatisfaction that she had&#xD;
tempted the evil spirit in her husband,-.-..the demon of jeal-&#xD;
ousy, which was ever ready to start into life, with or without&#xD;
occasion. ft gave her a malicious pleasure to give rein to&#xD;
her coquetries before his very eyes; to dash aside with reck-&#xD;
lessness the strong hand which had restrained her freedom.&#xD;
Her brilliant, defiant glance fell like fii~e upon her husband's&#xD;

&#xD;
clouded brow; he rose, and left the room abruptly. Walter&#xD;
arose also, wondering to find it so late.&#xD;
"Come often, that we may talk of America," said Mrs.&#xD;
Benzoni.&#xD;
" II will do so with pleasure," he rejoined.&#xD;
Weeks passed away, and only a sullen silence prevailed&#xD;
between husband' and wife. Mr. J3enzoni had at first endeav-&#xD;
ored to convince Judith that her manners were unbecoming&#xD;
a Inarried lady.&#xD;
"116w unbecoming, pray?" she demanded.&#xD;
"You laughed too much."&#xD;
"Pshaw! I am glad to get a chance to laugh once in a&#xD;
'while. If you intend to play the ogre, I shall not trouble&#xD;
you. with laughing."&#xD;
"Madamo Beuzoni, have a care!" he exclaimed fiercely.&#xD;
"I think you have not understood your husband's disposition.&#xD;
If you are not guarded in your conduct; if after to-day you&#xD;
prove yourself less than a prudent and obedient wife, you will&#xD;
find yourself there, beneath my foot!" he stamped it,~ and&#xD;
'eyed her with a passionate malignity that made her shudder.&#xD;
She restrained the sneer she dared not show, and contented&#xD;
herself with soliloquizing, ~" Old fool! he'll get over it before&#xD;
long. He shall make th~ first advances to me for this."&#xD;
Consequently she maintai4ed a reserved demeanor, and sus-&#xD;
pended all the winning wa~ys which had power over her hus-&#xD;
hand's heart. If for a mment she felt ready to relent, the&#xD;
remembrance of his angry and insulting speech awoke all the&#xD;
resentment of her nature. Occasionally Walter dropped in,&#xD;
and often succeeded in chasing the gloom from her anxious&#xD;
face. She thought within herself, "Flow much kinder he~&#xD;
would have been to me!" and even in her husband's presence&#xD;
her tone was more tender to him than it ought to ha~~ been.&#xD;
Yet she was supremely miserable; for each day deeper~ed 'the&#xD;
rigid coldness of her husband's manner, until she fe~t that&#xD;
&#xD;
she was hateful' in his sight. And then, when it seemed to&#xD;
her too late to win him hack, a wild, intolerable thirst for his&#xD;
lost love came over her. On her knees, she supplicated for&#xD;
victory over her pride, and sometimes even started to cast&#xD;
herself at Gibvanni's feet, to beseech him to fold her to his&#xD;
heart once more, and she would be a child to obey his will,-.--.&#xD;
only a dutiful child,-a loving, adoring wife. But his cold,&#xD;
repelling look fell like ice upon her spirit, and started into&#xD;
being a reckless defiance against him, that hardened her into&#xD;
flint. If Walter came at such a time, her wild gayety and&#xD;
impassioned bitterness excited his wonder. One evening her&#xD;
husband had left her in such a mood; she had for the first&#xD;
time spoken to Walter with a gush of tears, of the happy&#xD;
days when she was free.&#xD;
Mr. il3enzoni entered as the words were on her lips; he&#xD;
~aw the tears she had proudly checked in his presence. His&#xD;
dark suspicions of her guilty love for Walter were now con- ~&#xD;
firmed.&#xD;
Walter himself had been embarrassed at her careless im-&#xD;
prudence of speech, and his 'manner was confused at 'the&#xD;
sudden but quiet entrance of Mr. Benzoni. He took his&#xD;
leave, he hardly knew how, except that it was under' the&#xD;
fiery glances of the jealous husband: he hastened into the&#xD;
dim street, and pondered Judith's fate. It was plain, he&#xD;
thought, that she .was unhappy; she seemed glad of his&#xD;
friendship; almost she seemed to seek it: she had often said&#xD;
when they parted, "Come again."&#xD;
And Walter had obeyed, the while a "still small voice"&#xD;
arose in his soul to dissuade him. Now her tears had affect-&#xD;
ed him with a deeper and more thrilling interest; he yearned-&#xD;
to comfort her, and this yearning overpowered altogether that&#xD;
still small voice." He paced up and down, wondering when&#xD;
he should see Madame Benzoni again. Sud~lenly he thought&#xD;

of a letter which he had received on his way to Judith's, and&#xD;
had not read.&#xD;
Ah, bewildering woman! there was an angel at hand,&#xD;
who was to lead a careless spirit down into the healing waters,&#xD;
that he might see with clearer vision. The letter was from&#xD;
C-race. Walter read it under ~ street lamp. In it occurred&#xD;
this passage:&#xD;
"My brother Walter (let me~ call you so), II think so&#xD;
often~ how you are surrounded with temptations, with no&#xD;
mother to counsel and plead with you, that you may keep&#xD;
the narrow way, and go "from strength to strength," as you&#xD;
pursue the path of life. Perhaps you do not reflect that&#xD;
every act is one round of a ladder that will lead upward, or&#xD;
it is one round of a ladder that will lead downward. I trem..&#xD;
ble for the integrity of your spirit. Understand me, dear&#xD;
Walte~', I tremble for yoa a~ I would for a dear brother&#xD;
whom IL loved because of the existence of a thousand noble&#xD;
qualities and pure aspirations. III have no fear that you will&#xD;
ever fall into gross vices, but you are moving in a new world&#xD;
now; one that seduces the spirit from energy, and faith and&#xD;
purity. Pardon me that Ii send a warning, supplicating voice&#xD;
over the sea; pardon me that I pray you, now that all re-&#xD;
straints are removed, to keep the inner temple of your being&#xD;
sacred to holy purposes and innocent thoughts; let not this&#xD;
new possession of wealth become a source of. evil-a means&#xD;
to deteriorate your life, rather than to ennoble it. Good and&#xD;
gentle deeds will lead you up a shining pathway to where the&#xD;
beauteous heaven~ open. Let not careless dreams lead you&#xD;
to forget the pitfalls of earth-mark the passing hours with&#xD;
gold, and the treasure will be laid up for you. Dear brother,&#xD;
do you hear me? Are you still the same? Do you recall&#xD;
the conversations we have had ?-they strengthened us for&#xD;
the life-battle. Do you understand how my heart yearns to&#xD;

"Yes, generous heart, IL have heard, you!" came from&#xD;
the lips of Walter, as he dashed his hand across his eyes, and&#xD;
plunged the letter in his pocket. lie walked slowly up and&#xD;
doWn, thinking of "old times," and contrasting his forgotten&#xD;
aspirations with his present states lie instituted an earnest&#xD;
self-examination; he realized for the first time that his vanity&#xD;
was flattered by the interest of the beautiful Madame Ben-&#xD;
zoni; he saw that her influence was directly opposite the&#xD;
heaven-inspiring effect which Grace always l~ad upon him.&#xD;
He rcincmiJered the heartless manner in which Judith had&#xD;
trifled with his honest love, and the gruel indifference with&#xD;
which she had consigned Grace to suffering, because siw&#xD;
was incapable of noble self-sacrifice. Walter wondered that&#xD;
he had ever renewed his acquaintance with Mrs. Benzoni; it&#xD;
began to look like a very unwise act. lie had desired to see&#xD;
her in the first place that she might learn how totally old&#xD;
feelings had died out of his heart: and then he had wished&#xD;
to show her how generously a lover could change into a friend.&#xD;
He felt a little self-contempt after having sifted his motives&#xD;
thoroughly; new resolves sprung up within him.&#xD;
He walked away amid the murky shadows of the night&#xD;
to his lodgings, a~id as he walked, he murmured, "You have&#xD;
saved n~e, angel across the seal"&#xD;
It was nearly morning when he entered his solitary room.&#xD;
lie sat down and penned a polite notc to Mr. Benzoni, say-&#xD;
ing a letter from America had decided him to leave for Ger-&#xD;
many the next morning; he should therefore be prevented&#xD;
from paying his farewell respects to Mr. and Mrs. Benzoni.&#xD;
As he' sealed his little note, he imagined th~it it would make&#xD;
matters straight between the husband and wife; if the former&#xD;
had indulged a little jealousy, he would now see that there&#xD;

140               WALTER'S LETTER.                                                   A GENEROUS SOUL.               147&#xD;
&#xD;
would be no future occasion for it. Little did Walter Gray&#xD;
comprehend how strong a hold vile suspicions had over the&#xD;
mind 'of the ILtalian.&#xD;
Walt~r drew forth another sheet of papet and wrote to&#xD;
Grace.&#xD;
"DEAR, hONORED SIsTER,-4 am at a loss for words to ex-&#xD;
press the debt of thanks I owe you-a debt II cannot cancel.&#xD;
Your letter came at a critical moment of my life. Yes,&#xD;
Grace, IL was just losing my hold of the high aims I once had.&#xD;
I was not projecting wrong deeds, but I was dreaming that I&#xD;
would seek the pleasure of the moment, and glide along with&#xD;
the stream into any haven that God or fate might' waft me&#xD;
to. You addressed me from impulse, and the earnest impulse&#xD;
struck my soul with a conviction that I must turn instantly&#xD;
around and retrace the moral steps II had been taking. I do&#xD;
believe, Grace, that the Divine Being always lends us an&#xD;
angel to lead us aright when we waver. We do not heed the&#xD;
spiritual presence that bids us beware. Many times in my&#xD;
life, I have noticed slight occurrences that led me from a&#xD;
wrong course. Your letter is one of many. .1 love you, sis-&#xD;
ter Grace, for the confidence you have used tQwards me-it&#xD;
has been the pebble which has turned the whole current of&#xD;
my being. After reading your letter, I could not sleep until&#xD;
II had changed all my plans-the ~ims and objects of yester-&#xD;
day are not the aims and objects of to-day, or those which&#xD;
shall engross my most Aevoted attention hereafter. Yester-&#xD;
day I had no strength to wrestle for the noble in life and&#xD;
action. To-day a strain is poured forth upon my ear, by one&#xD;
who is interested in my well-being. I listen !-its siren song&#xD;
wins me from the lulling dreams that lead down to the cham-&#xD;
bers of guilt-.-calls me back to the paths which are strewed&#xD;
with flowers of purity, wherein the honorable walk. Hark!&#xD;
she sings of the great, the good, who are "not for a day, but&#xD;
&#xD;
for all time." Look! she points where, at the goal, the vic-&#xD;
tor is crowned with an evergreen wreath.&#xD;
I am going to Germany to-morrow. I shall devote my-&#xD;
self to music-and if I chance to see a poor fellow chafing&#xD;
under destiny as IL once did, I will lend him a helping hand.&#xD;
The gray of morning is stealing into my windows.&#xD;
Thanks, heartfelt thanks for your voice, dear Grace. Your&#xD;
gently reproving, kindly persuading ~train~ has not been&#xD;
pourcd~ forth altogether in vain for your friend,&#xD;
WALTER GRAY."&#xD;
Walter was of a chivalrous nature, therefore Grace's let-&#xD;
ter went to his generous soul. Another might have received&#xD;
the same words with indifference. Grace had ever seemed&#xD;
to him of a heavenly nature, yet his deep attachment for her&#xD;
was entirely without passion. In the olden days he would&#xD;
haVe fought for her in the tournament, and would have knelt&#xD;
to have kissed the border of her robe. Grace would have&#xD;
smiledwith astonishment could she have seen the high place&#xD;
she occupied in Walter's mind as a perfect woman. She re-&#xD;
garded herself as an every-day character.&#xD;
With characteristic enthusiasm, Walter packed up all his&#xD;
baggage, and then knelt down and prayed with uncommon&#xD;
energy and fervor, before committing himself to his bed for&#xD;
a little sleep. The last thought he had before relapsing into&#xD;
entire unconsciousness was. that he was C~ empty, swept, and&#xD;
0'&#xD;
tarnished, above all weakness or temptation now, quite pre-&#xD;
pared to enter the new Jerusalem above. He slept serenely,&#xD;
until the noonday sun shone in upon him. That day he&#xD;
started on his travels to Germany-and h~ also pursued his&#xD;
travels to heaven.&#xD;

TIlE MADNESS OF GRIEF.           149&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
~TnR thorns I reap, are of the tree I planted." It was&#xD;
with a shuddering terror Judith had caught her husband's&#xD;
glance at the moment those fatal words had left her lips.&#xD;
She felt that to his dark spirit they were "confirmation&#xD;
strong as proof of holy writ." The room reqled before her&#xD;
-a great, black tide of agony came swelling over her breast,&#xD;
swimming about her ears-she started from her chair, as if&#xD;
to grasp something. Walter had hardly closed the door,&#xD;
when she fell prostrate upon the carpet. No tender hand&#xD;
lifted her up, and sought to restore her to life-no mur-&#xD;
niured lullaby kissed her back to a world of joy and affec~&#xD;
tion. Her husband stood above her, with deep and dreadful&#xD;
curses on his lips-~-hcr snowy, jewelled hand lay out upon&#xD;
the dark ground-work of the carpet-he could scarcely for..&#xD;
bear setting his iron heel upon it, and crushing it to pieces.&#xD;
He removed the long, waving black ~4nglets from her face&#xD;
with his boot, and then stooped down to gaze upon her; he&#xD;
clutched her hair, and held it lJack,, as he listened to see if&#xD;
she breathed. "It would take but little to send her to&#xD;
burning perdition now !"he muttered. lie still glared upon&#xD;
her, and compressed his lips with a wild, terrible purpose,&#xD;
the offspring ~f his heated brain. He laid his hand upon&#xD;
&#xD;
her white throat. Just then a tender, pitiful cry from his&#xD;
babe reached his ear. He paused, and heard the nurse re-&#xD;
ply in softest tones of endearment.&#xD;
Oh God! what was if doing?" he exclaimed, striking&#xD;
his forehead. He started to his feet, and turning his face&#xD;
from Judith, buried it in his hands. A shower of burning&#xD;
tears relieved his frenzy. He gazed again upon the poor&#xD;
senseless heap before him.&#xD;
Judith sighed heavily, and opened her eyes-her mourn-&#xD;
ful gaze turned to him. lie met it unmoved. She raised&#xD;
herself; and uttered entreatingly, "Giovanni, you wrong&#xD;
"Silence!" he returned, the fiend coming back to his&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Listen to me, and we may yet be happy!" she mi-&#xD;
J)Iored, dragging herself to the spot where he stood.&#xD;
"It is my turn to speak, miserable girl. We part for&#xD;
ever to-night! ~&#xD;
Oh no! no! " she screamed, clasping his knees, and&#xD;
looking up in his face in the wildest agony of prayer. "I&#xD;
have bcei1 imprudent, thoughtless, but I am innocent. I&#xD;
am yours, body and soul. Punish me, kill me, but do not&#xD;
forsake n~! Oh! If will do any thing, every thing! Sit&#xD;
(lown, and let me tell you all that is in my heart. I will&#xD;
speak truly, as II expect the judgment-day. If love only you,&#xD;
I have been faithful to you!"&#xD;
"Faithful!" he sneered, endeavoring to unloose her&#xD;
hold.&#xD;
"Giovanni!" she cried wildly, starting to her feet, and&#xD;
raising her right hand upward. "There is a mighty God&#xD;
above, who will bring everlasting vengeance on you, if you&#xD;
drive me to madness, and death, and despair, without just&#xD;
He looked upon her excited features, and slowly replied,&#xD;
&#xD;

150               THE SEPARATION.                                               RETURNING PRIDE.             151&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yc~u and I gave one soul to drink of despair; we are&#xD;
reaping our reward!"&#xD;
"Despair! She never knew the fiery serpents of pas-&#xD;
sion that lash and choke my life. I am innocent! Take&#xD;
me, keep me, save me from myself, from God, from hell!&#xD;
Oh! I tremble! I fear every thing! Mercy, Giovanni!&#xD;
have mercy!" She trembled violently, and laid her hand&#xD;
upon his arm. He shook it off.&#xD;
"For our child's sake!" she whispered.&#xD;
"The child you have disgraced! Keep her! She is&#xD;
yours; she will be like you. I shall see her no more. 1&#xD;
will not run the risk of blushing to call her daughter. Go&#xD;
where you will! tay here if you will! The world need&#xD;
not know why we h~ve parted. Difference of habit, of dis-&#xD;
position." He smiled bitterly as he spoke the last sentence.&#xD;
"Farewell, madam!"&#xD;
She grasped his arm, and utt red,&#xD;
"Giovanni !" but he was gon , and she stood ~there alone.&#xD;
She hurriedly reached the win ow, and tried to raise it,&#xD;
that she might spring from it, nd drink of endless sleep.&#xD;
It resisted her frenzied efforts; she sunk upon a sofa, and&#xD;
hid her face amid its cushions; g 'adually she lost herself in&#xD;
stupor. The morning light sh ne in the room, when the&#xD;
forsaken wife awoke from her wretched, terrified sleep.&#xD;
Marie stood by her, with the aby in her arms, looking&#xD;
down with deepest pity; great tears were rolling down her&#xD;
face. She had partially heard the burden of the last night's&#xD;
dispute, and Mr. Benzoni had entered the nursery early that&#xD;
morning, and wept passionately over his child, straining it to&#xD;
his breast, until it cried with pain, He had even said,&#xD;
"Marie, will you be a mother to this child? Will you&#xD;
bring her to me if I write for you?"&#xD;
And Marie had timidly, yet firmly answered, "I cannot&#xD;
&#xD;
steal her from her mother-she is hers-sl~e suffered for&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Mr. Benzoni had answered, "True, she is hers by right."&#xD;
Marie gazed into the uplifted eyes of her mistress some mo-&#xD;
inents, crc the whole dreadful truth came to Judith's spirit.&#xD;
Even in her awakened anguish, the tears of ber servant&#xD;
galled her. She waved her hand for her to step aside, and&#xD;
turned her face to the wall.&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Benzoni ?" she at length asked.&#xD;
"I do not know, madam; he did not say where he was&#xD;
going.&#xD;
"Go away, Marie!" Marie went, and Judith groaned,&#xD;
and wept, and tore her hair, and cursed her misery, her ex-&#xD;
istence, her impotence.&#xD;
"Love may sink by slow decay,&#xD;
But by sudden wrench, believe not,&#xD;
Hearts may thus be torn away'&#xD;
A letter was handed to Madame Benzoni; she broke the&#xD;
seal with fevered eagerness, hoping it might be from her&#xD;
husband. Tt was merely Walter's note. "What a dread-&#xD;
ful doom to fall upon me, for a little careless coquetry!"&#xD;
she wept, "and he, that foolish boy, has left me in my lone-&#xD;
liness and woe. Alas! if i[ had some heart to lean upon!&#xD;
Oh! that Giovanni should have driven me into this hope-&#xD;
less abyss ! "&#xD;
Thu;s the days wore on in abject wretchedness, until&#xD;
iride stole back to its accustomed den. Judith formed her&#xD;
plans; she threw aside the opium. wherewith she had&#xD;
drugged her consciousness of pain. She went to her mirror,&#xD;
and saw with surprise the change that' had passed over her&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
"It shall all come back," she murmured, "and if it be&#xD;

&#xD;
in human power to effect it, that man shall kneel at niy feet&#xD;
as J'knelt at his, and as vainly. I will devote my life to&#xD;
convincing him of my innocence, my worth, my charms "-&#xD;
she smiled a ghastly smile, "he shall learn that Ii am a de-&#xD;
voted mother, a faithful friend, a spotless woman, sought by&#xD;
the wisest, the noblest, the ~best." Judith devoted herself&#xD;
to a course of physical training that won back the roses to&#xD;
her cheeks. She had been greatly admired since her resi-&#xD;
dence in Italy; she had ever drawn about her young men&#xD;
of fashion, and more blas6 admirers, yet she had never lis-&#xD;
tened to words ~at the purest might miot hear. Now she&#xD;
closed her door~ upon all but those of a higher stamp of&#xD;
morality. She was pitied, courted and caressed by the love-&#xD;
liest women around l~er. It was only known that her hus-&#xD;
band had cruelly abandoned her; he provided amply for all&#xD;
her wants, and sought no divorce, therefore she was the&#xD;
sinned against, he the sinning. She cultivated sedulously&#xD;
her conversational gifts, and graceful enriched her talk&#xD;
with jewels of wit and knowledge. Her idle nature seemed&#xD;
replaced by a totally different one; the clear soprano voice&#xD;
she had taken so little pains to cultivate, she now subjected&#xD;
to the highest training. Her once gay manner was now&#xD;
more fascinating than ever, by its half reserve. The witch-&#xD;
cry she exercised over the hearts of men, sprung from subtle&#xD;
arts; they dared not acknowledge it, they dared not believe&#xD;
she was aware of it, so pure and chaste was her whole hear-&#xD;
ing. And yet her stern spirit only thirsted for the day that&#xD;
would briugher revenge; she would scornfully have immo-&#xD;
lated every heart that amused her. Love for her child&#xD;
sometimes welled passionately into her heart. She strove&#xD;
sometimes to repress it, for she had learned that they suffer&#xD;
most who love most.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
A YI~AIL had not made great changes in ou~. family circle.&#xD;
Walter had left us, and James was frequently absent a&#xD;
month at a time on business, although he still called our&#xD;
house home. Mr. IRodman was able to provide for the mod-&#xD;
crate wants of his family, and still do a little towards pay-&#xD;
ing his debts. He had grown to be an altered man; our&#xD;
cordial interest in him seemed to meet a thoughtful return.&#xD;
We listened often with a sensation of pleasure to remarks&#xD;
of his, which indicated truer views of life and duty-and'&#xD;
then after he had left us, we lifted up our eyes t each other,&#xD;
smiling to think how sweet it was to have hi accompany&#xD;
us on the heavenly road. Often he was haras ed and per-&#xD;
plexed about his old business, and his former of&#xD;
manner returned-but it was not seldom that 1'w conquered&#xD;
this, and closed an impatient remark more geh tly than he,&#xD;
had begun it. He never made an apology; he was too&#xD;
proud for that, but sometimes a little act of thoughtfulness&#xD;
seemed to ask his wife to forget a previous hars~m word-and&#xD;
then a soft flush would glow on her cheek, and 4 light would&#xD;
come in~ her eyes, as if sunrise were breaking o~or her soul.&#xD;
It was morning, and the orient light stole through the&#xD;
nursery windows, as I sat and painted there alone. Grace&#xD;
was in our chamber dressing foi' a brief journey. Miss&#xD;
Cardover was coming to take her in the country to spend a&#xD;

MR. CARDOVER AND GRACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
month with her. Every summer she emigrated with her&#xD;
family to a lovely place, callCd Blooming Hill. It was but&#xD;
a few miles from Boston. Here a widowed brother resided&#xD;
the year round. I had never seen him. In this sequestered&#xD;
place our minister, Mr. Waldron, also lived in the summer&#xD;
with his aged parents. Miss Cardover had earnestly pressed&#xD;
me to accompany Grace, but I had gratefully declined. Ii&#xD;
desired to go so much, it was with the o'reatest reluctance&#xD;
I could 'compel myself to say "no." But her brother Pliny&#xD;
went there from the city every evening, and I did not care&#xD;
to meet him as often as I should, if I became temporarily a&#xD;
member 'of the same household. I felt as if I should never&#xD;
recover from the humiliation of having him suspect that he&#xD;
seemed better and brighter to me than any other human be-&#xD;
ing. It wad a proud satisfaction to me to know that lie&#xD;
thought I wa~ not attracted to him. I strove to show this&#xD;
not eagerly, r arrogantly, but quietly and naturally. He&#xD;
had been so gentle to Grace; a transient wonder if he loved&#xD;
her sometimes flashed over me; I feared it, and then the&#xD;
fear glided away to come again another time. I knew that&#xD;
he pitied her for the blight that had fallen upon her youth;&#xD;
and I knew that Grace preferred always to walk with him if&#xD;
other gentlemen sought to attend her from church. If we&#xD;
went to places of amusement, James always fell to my lot,&#xD;
because Grace would not go with him; thus she and Mr.&#xD;
Cardover seemed always naturally to go together. I had&#xD;
long since made a resolution not to let my thoughts dwell&#xD;
upon him; sometimes unbidden they broke upon me, and&#xD;
whispered, "He does not love Grace." So II was thinking&#xD;
and dreaming in the orient light, with my elbQw on the ta-&#xD;
ble, and my head upon my hand; my painting was forgot-&#xD;
ten. I had hoped in slays past that Grace would return the&#xD;
'feelings with which Mr. Waldron regarded her; very soon&#xD;
after Mr. Benzoni left for Italy, he had sought Grace 'often;&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
CllE~RY AS SUNSHINE.&#xD;
&#xD;
16b&#xD;
&#xD;
but the instant she felt sure that his frequent calls were de..&#xD;
signed for her, she had assumed a coldness oMemeanor that&#xD;
led to his staying away: her suffering and chilled heart was&#xD;
dead then to new hopes and affections. Now she felt differ-&#xD;
ently, and another might interest her. Who would be the&#xD;
magician?&#xD;
While I[ was thus indulging in reverie, a light, quick&#xD;
tap sounded on the nursery-door. J opened it, and gave&#xD;
entrance to Miss Cardover, who looked as cheery as sunshine&#xD;
itself.&#xD;
~' Oh, Kitty," s14 said, "it is too bad in you not to go&#xD;
with us. I have Pliny's light carriage at the door; it will&#xD;
hold three very well-won't you go?"&#xD;
"I think not," I returned, smiling. "I thank you with&#xD;
all my heart."&#xD;
"If you thanked me very much, you would go with us,"&#xD;
she exclaimed, with a little peremptory shake of her head.&#xD;
"I am going to drive myself, in real country fashion. Is&#xD;
Grace nearly ready?"&#xD;
"Yes; she will be down presently. I heard one of the&#xD;
children running up stairs as you came in, to tell her."&#xD;
"Pliny would have driven us to Blooming Hill, but I&#xD;
had a faint hope that you would go; and therefore told him'&#xD;
there would not be room for him. Now I suppose he will&#xD;
think he might have enjoyed Grace's society as well as not."&#xD;
"Probably," I answered. My heart gave a sudden beat&#xD;
-a dreadful beat.&#xD;
"Has Grace forgotten Mr. Benzoni ?" pursued Miss&#xD;
Cardover.&#xD;
"I think she has overcome her affection for him," I re-&#xD;
turned. "She has lost her esteem for him of course."&#xD;
"I always thought she and Pliny were made for each&#xD;
other. They are both so good, so noble, so heroic," said&#xD;
Miss Cardover. "I felt when Pliny was disappointed in&#xD;

156             A LETTER FROM GnACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
EVENING AT BLOOMING HILL.        157&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Morton, and Grace in Mr. Benzoni, that Providence&#xD;
had reserved them for each other. Please do not mention&#xD;
what I have said to Grace."&#xD;
"No, I will not."&#xD;
Grace caine down all smiles. She looked so young, so&#xD;
cheerful, as if sweet views of life and destiny were folded&#xD;
to her heart. It seemed as if they had suddenly withered&#xD;
from Inine.&#xD;
"~-ood-bye, dear, darling Kate!" she said, pi~essing her&#xD;
fresh lips on my cheek.&#xD;
"Oh, I am going to the door with you," I said and fob&#xD;
lowed them down stairs. Cousin Mary, the cAhildren, and&#xD;
Mary MeConkey gathered in the hail to say "Good bye."&#xD;
And so they left us.&#xD;
A week after I received the following note fro~i Grace:&#xD;
"Blessed Katy, (excuse the blessed, for I feel like pro-&#xD;
nouncing benedictions upon every thing and every body,) you&#xD;
must and shall come here and make a little visit. Kate, it&#xD;
seems strange to me that you should not want to come, when&#xD;
they would be so glad to have you. I am afraid they will&#xD;
think you are indifferent to their warm feelings towards you,&#xD;
if you. do not 'come. We have such charming times! Such&#xD;
a spell of freshness has stolen over me since I have been&#xD;
here. I am so happy, happier than I have been, Kate, since&#xD;
Giovanni left me. I do not lament that now. I believe&#xD;
it was the most fortunate event that could' have happened&#xD;
to me.' We wander in the woods, by the sea-shore-Nature&#xD;
has opened her innermost treasures to me,~and I walk amid&#xD;
her glories, as if they were leading me to the open gate of&#xD;
Ueaven. That terrible ~incubus is thrown from my spirit,&#xD;
and it boi~uds -backward to its youth, and onward to a hith-&#xD;
erto unrevealed world of gladness and glory. I may again&#xD;
&#xD;
weep, but not so hopelessly. I thank God that I have crossed&#xD;
the abyss.&#xD;
"Come to us, darling! Pliny says he 'will call to-morrow&#xD;
evening to see if you will ride out with him next day. Don't&#xD;
disappoint us. Give a world of love to Mary and the children.&#xD;
Your affectionate     GRACE."&#xD;
This bright note communicated only pain to me ;-great&#xD;
pain. How could she be so joyous if love was not the su~i&#xD;
of her heaven? How could she rejoice that she had been&#xD;
separated' from oxie whom she had loved so' utterly? Yes!&#xD;
the selfish tears dropt upon the paper as II held it.-they&#xD;
dropt fast' as I knelt and prayed fo~ self-renunciation.&#xD;
It was my destii'iy to leave my sheltering home, and'go to&#xD;
them. I had no excuse to offer. Would not God grant me&#xD;
strength and love through the coming hours? Would he&#xD;
not sustain me when sudden blows smote my heart, and I&#xD;
had no power to turn away ? A ~ must prepare to meet, with&#xD;
tranquil, smiling fac9, the deepest pangs I had ever known.&#xD;
Alas! one year had not glided on without deepening the&#xD;
feelings I bad struggled against.&#xD;
I told Cousin Mary I was going' to loomingg Hill next&#xD;
day. She was delighted, and suggested many little attentions&#xD;
my wardrobe needed. II devoted myself to the~e little duties&#xD;
with a sort of anguish. What difference did it make how I&#xD;
should look? I felt grateful that I could conceal my feel- /&#xD;
ings under a light manner, when there existed a strong ne-&#xD;
cessity that I should do so. It is comparatively easy to&#xD;
disguise mental pain, when others do not suspect that it&#xD;
exists.&#xD;
Evening drew near. "Shall I read' to you, Kate? ~&#xD;
inquired' Mr. Bedell, going in the parlor to sit 'by the solar&#xD;
lamp. "I bought Hyperion to-day; that is a favorite of&#xD;
'yours, I believe."&#xD;

&#xD;
158                m~. CARDOVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," I answered. "I should. like to hear you read&#xD;
from it." lb took my sewing and sat down near him. He&#xD;
was a fine reader. He often stopped to make remarks-T&#xD;
did also: one time I was replying to his observations, and&#xD;
carefully turning down a hem at the same time: as I looked&#xD;
up, he dropped hi~ eyes; he had never looked at me so be-&#xD;
fore, and I was struck with intense embarrassment. This&#xD;
confusion emboldened him, and he took my hand. At this&#xD;
instant the door opened and Mr. Cardover was ushered in by&#xD;
Mary MeGonkey. He evidently saw that his presence was&#xD;
inopportune; he hesitated, but we both exclaimed, "Come&#xD;
in!"&#xD;
I added, "How are they all at Blooming Hill ?"&#xD;
"Quite well!" he answered, as he took the chair James&#xD;
offered him. "My sister desired me to call this evening to&#xD;
see if you would ride o4t to see them in the ~morning."&#xD;
"Yes. I was expecting to. Grace wrote that I must&#xD;
be ready to accompany you to-morrow morning." A solemn&#xD;
silence ensued after Mr. Cardover had bowed to my re-&#xD;
mark.&#xD;
"Have you ever read H        Mr. Cardover?" asked&#xD;
James, endeavoring not to appear embarrassed, and apparent-&#xD;
ly not thinking exactly what he was saying. He had men-&#xD;
tioned to me, as we sat down to read, that the book h~d been&#xD;
recommended to him by Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"I have read it I" was the response, as gravely made as&#xD;
if this fact had not occurred.&#xD;
Cousin Mary fortunately came in at this moment, and in&#xD;
her innocent unconsciousness she entered into a list of ani-&#xD;
mated questions about Grace that set us quite a1~ ease; then&#xD;
she left us to ourselves again, but as her presence glided from&#xD;
the room, a sort of restraint glided in.&#xD;
Mr. Cardover did not stay long; he left, promising to&#xD;
call for me in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
I went with him to the door, and as I closed it, I ex-&#xD;
claimed, "Good night, James!"&#xD;
Then I turned and went up stairs: James did not reply;&#xD;
as I passed the door,. I was ConSCious that he still sat by the&#xD;
table, although I did not look in. I felt as though my words&#xD;
fell like ice upon him, but I saw no reas6a'why any conver-&#xD;
sation shotild pass between us. ]i was in a tumult of painful&#xD;
surprise inwardly: it grieved me that our frank, kind friend-&#xD;
ship could exist no Kbmger: I learned how much I had valued&#xD;
it.&#xD;
Now, II saw c&#xD;
clearly how James's regard for me had been&#xD;
of gradual growth-I had known it, but I had supposed it&#xD;
was merely a fraternal affection-I had supposed Grace's&#xD;
image still slept in his remembrance. I had tried to interest&#xD;
and amuse him to divert his mind from his disappointment,&#xD;
and as I saw his cheerfulness returning, I had rejoiced in it.&#xD;
Once or twice he had frankly spoken of his attachment to&#xD;
Grace. I had seen so little of life, that I had believed first&#xD;
love could not be conquered under a great many years. The&#xD;
bubl~le was being rapidly broken under my very eyes by more&#xD;
than one friend.&#xD;
I remembered that a few days before, James had asked&#xD;
me in a tone that now struck me as peculiar, if I thought I&#xD;
should like to lh~e at the South. I had cordially answered,&#xD;
"Oh yes, I should like to for a while, not for ever."&#xD;
It was his design to remove to a southern city as a&#xD;
chemist. He had not yet fixed on a time for his departure.&#xD;
It was a relief to know that he would soon be far distant&#xD;
from us, and yet a pain, for he had been so unceasingly kind&#xD;
to me, so ready to cheer me, if heavy shadows chanced to&#xD;
come over my soul.&#xD;
An uncomfortable night p~xssed away, and the morning,&#xD;
bright and exultant, broke into my chamber. How I dread-&#xD;
ed the day, and many coming days! To go from that quiet&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
house, seemed to me almost as sorrowful as the departure of&#xD;
Eve from Paradise she went from bliss t6 suffering, I from&#xD;
calm life and tranquil duties to conflict and anguish, which&#xD;
must be hidden under dissimulation !-it was this necessity&#xD;
of concealment, this force of circumstances, that excluded me&#xD;
from seeking sympathy, that made me doubly miserable.&#xD;
The stricken mourner may listen to words of strength, may&#xD;
be sustained by loving arms; but the secret mourner must&#xD;
put on no weeds, must cling to no human arm&#xD;
I went to the window, and looked out upon the sunshine&#xD;
-the azure heaven was peaceful as the blue eyes of an infant.&#xD;
Our little yard had never seemed so dear, so beautiful; the&#xD;
grape-vine clung in rich luxuriance to the trellis, the crab-&#xD;
apple tree and cherry tree were full of green foliage-the&#xD;
flower beds, occupying the only sunny spot, were blossoming&#xD;
and precious from the care bestowed upon thielNi. These&#xD;
things I should not 1~ave heeded, if I were not going to leave&#xD;
them-they seemed to assure me that I should ti~ead a thorny&#xD;
path ere I should see them again. IL shrank from the woe of&#xD;
life-from the particular woe which had been accorded to&#xD;
me. IL could have borne it, if fate had carried me far away&#xD;
from the objects who would unwittingly give me pain. But&#xD;
what good could it do to think ?-.I must work while I could.&#xD;
* After dressing, IL packed up a few articles, put my room in&#xD;
order, and then sat down to read the Bible; one verse struck&#xD;
my heart as peculiarly applicable. "He that observeth the&#xD;
~iud shall not sow; and 'he that regarded the clouds ~hall&#xD;
not reap." Had I not forgotten lately th~t I had a holy&#xD;
mission upon earth? It was very simple, very clear, very&#xD;
beautiful I It was "to sow beside all waters." It was to&#xD;
learn how I might live in the radiance of the King Eternal,&#xD;
and how I might help every human being with whom I came&#xD;
in contact to live in this beautiful. radiance also,-clouds and&#xD;
darkness were between me and the Divine One, always had&#xD;

been, and only sorrow could jremove them rapidly, and clear&#xD;
the path that leads to Him who is the origin of i'est and&#xD;
beauty. It was a mistake to allow the wind and clouds of&#xD;
the present, to shut from my view the grand end which IL&#xD;
must labor for. Somewhat consoled, somewhat niore hope-&#xD;
ful, Ii knelt and eutreated for power to take the sorrows and&#xD;
cares of life with a grateful spirit-I implored strength to&#xD;
walk in ~ny own path with content-implored the All-Merci-&#xD;
ful to lead me in His way to the beautiful destiny which He&#xD;
reserves for his beloved.&#xD;
I went down to breakfast. When I left the dining-room&#xD;
to go up stairs, James took his hat and left the room also.&#xD;
We were in the hall together.&#xD;
"Good-bye, James," I said, extending my hand. "You&#xD;
have always been so kind to me!"&#xD;
"And yet -" he said, looking directly at me; his coun-&#xD;
tenance wa~ pale, and he closed his firm lips together lest he&#xD;
should not finish the sentence steadily.&#xD;
~' And yet -" II repeated tears gathered, and I bowed&#xD;
my face, and kissed the hand that held mine humbly: "and&#xD;
yet, good-bye---for ever."&#xD;
"Good-bye, dear Kate!" he pressed my hand, looked at&#xD;
me with an expression that smote me to the heart, although&#xD;
there was only yearning love and sorrow in it, and then~ he&#xD;
was gone. Oh! how I longed to tell him how Ii loved him&#xD;
with a sister's love! how I longed to bless him fo~ the manly&#xD;
spirit in which he received my refusal-it could be: called&#xD;
by no other name. How I yearned to cheer him, to offer&#xD;
noble fountains for the broken cisterns he had found. But&#xD;
it could not be.&#xD;
In the course of two or three hours, Mr. Cardover caine&#xD;
for me. I heard his rap, and listened at the head of the&#xD;
stairs to hear if any one went to the doQr. Presently I saw&#xD;
Miss McConkey walking through the hall, rubbing. her face&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8254-00000082"/>&#xD;
162              TilE PRETTY BONNET.&#xD;
clean with the skirt of her dress, and spatting her hair smooth&#xD;
with both hands.&#xD;
"How do you do, sir? Walk in if you please!" she ex-&#xD;
claimed with an extraordinary effort at politeness as she&#xD;
opened the door. I'll call Miss Kate."&#xD;
She came running up after me, and stood looking at every&#xD;
article I put on, as if my apparel were royal.&#xD;
"0, but aint that a pretty bonnet, though!" she uttered,&#xD;
and them gloves, don't they fit nicely ?"&#xD;
"Yes, very nicely! Are you going to be a good girl&#xD;
while I ~m gone, Mary ?" I observed as I put on my man-&#xD;
tilla.&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am! Did you make that mantilla, or buy it i?"&#xD;
"I made it. Good-bye!"&#xD;
I hastened down stairs, and found Mix Cardover ready to&#xD;
conduct me to the carriage. After we were fairly seated,&#xD;
and had nodded and smiled a last adieu to cousin Mary and&#xD;
the children, I saw Mary MeConkey's grave face behind&#xD;
them; a parting word to her had been forgotten.&#xD;
"Good bye, Mary MeConkey!" I cried; "I'll tell Miss&#xD;
Grace what a good girl you've been since she has been&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
Her face brightened all over~ as she smiled and nodded..&#xD;
Mr. Cardover kept up a running conversation upon ne~vs-&#xD;
paper topics, but it seemed to me to be carried on with effort&#xD;
on both sides. After a little silence he said, "James will go&#xD;
South very soon."&#xD;
"Yes," I briefly responded, coloring at the recollection&#xD;
of the previous evening. I added; "I have not heard him&#xD;
say what day he intends to leave."&#xD;
"You have not?" Mr. Cardover asked, looking at me&#xD;
searchingly, as if he doubted me almost.&#xD;
"No, I have not," I answered; "do you know?"&#xD;
"I saw him this. morning; he thought he should leave&#xD;
&#xD;
A NOBLE YOUNG ~IAN.              163&#xD;
day after to-morrow." Still the dark eyes were reading my&#xD;
face, and under their scrutiny I could not look quite calm.&#xD;
"Probably James decided the day this morning," Mr.&#xD;
Cardover said, half inquiringly; finding I made no response,&#xD;
hu continued, "probably he will come to Blooming Hill to-&#xD;
morrow to bid his friends farewell."&#xD;
"Did he say so?" i[ quickly asked.&#xD;
"No; and II forgot to ask him. Would he go South with-&#xD;
out seeing you again?" This was asked in a low voice: we&#xD;
must not converse in low, confidential tones; it was such&#xD;
friendly tones that had undone me.&#xD;
"He will, IL think, go South without seeing me," I an-&#xD;
swered, rattling my fan a little, to encourage myself.&#xD;
"James is a noble young man." The gaze was still&#xD;
riveted upon me, as if it wpuld reach the secrets of my soul.&#xD;
"Yes, I think so."&#xD;
"He has not niany external graces; but you, Kate, would&#xD;
care for the real man."&#xD;
"I suppose I oughL"&#xD;
* "And you do not?"&#xD;
I was silent.&#xD;
"You do not care for James?"&#xD;
My heart was trembling lest I should not seem calm and&#xD;
strong-lest in acknowledging that I did not love James,&#xD;
some accent or expression might betray me.-.--fear itself gave&#xD;
self-control, steadied my voice, and grasped pride for sup-&#xD;
port.&#xD;
"I do care for him," II said; "I love him as if he were a&#xD;
brotheix"&#xD;
"A long silence ensued-then Mr. Cardover said, with&#xD;
his kind glance upon my face-it seemed so kind-" And&#xD;
you have been weeping this morning,-perhaps on account&#xD;
of his near departure?"&#xD;
"I have been weeping for him." This was true, and I&#xD;

164           HOW BEAUTIFUL IS EARTH.                                                  THE RIDE.                 165&#xD;
&#xD;
was very glad it was the truth. "'Now let us stop talking&#xD;
of this," i[ said coldly. Very soon we came in sight of the&#xD;
ocean. Mr. Caidover slacked rein-the view was glorious!&#xD;
It came like a fresh draught to my heart. There is an in-&#xD;
spiring thrill in the dash of the rising tid&amp;amp;-in the billowy&#xD;
freedom of old ocean.&#xD;
\ "Oh, stop!" I entreated, unable to resist a thirsting desire&#xD;
to stand upon the beach, and gaze upon that vast expanse; it&#xD;
seemed to rebuke the hot iush of human passion. Mr. Car-&#xD;
dover stopped the carriage, and I sprang from it crc he did&#xD;
so himself&#xD;
"I am going," I said, nodding, as. I hastened to the beach.&#xD;
How beautiful was the earth !-it was rich in summer splen-&#xD;
dor; a' late shower had flung down a mantle of brilliance&#xD;
over eve1~y thing; the. trees, jewelled with sparkling drops,&#xD;
laughed in the sunshine; the grass was sweet and tender&#xD;
enough for the footfall of fairies; the music of bird rind in-&#xD;
sect and waving foliage came to my ear,-but II hastened&#xD;
nearer to the sound of the ocean's anthem. I had need of it.&#xD;
I stood momently upon the beach, and the grandeur, not of&#xD;
ocean, but of life, came overwhelmingly upon inc. What was&#xD;
the whole earth, but a material symbol of the glorious world&#xD;
of soul? Why did the ocean speak to me as the land could&#xD;
not? lit w~s because beauty had faded from my inner world,&#xD;
and I implored strength, mighty as that of the sea, to sustain&#xD;
me-more sublime.&#xD;
A rude mass of, rock loomed up on the sandy beach. I&#xD;
climbed it, and looked upon a still wider view. The sky w~s&#xD;
lovely; a soft, ethereal drapery veiled halt' the heavens, it~s&#xD;
~tender snow melting and sweeping through the bh~e. As ~[&#xD;
gazed, a poem of infinite, eternal beauty came to my soul ;-&#xD;
~xt that instant I was able to give up the disposal of my life -&#xD;
to the Great Creator-the Unerring Father. Yes, it&#xD;
seemed as if-Ill even prayed under a new heaven-under a&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
clearer light-prayed that the confusion and unsightliness of&#xD;
my inner world might be moulded by the Divine Architect&#xD;
into a new grace and' glory; faith in the beautiful and just&#xD;
arose; the strange splendor about me struck some deep,&#xD;
blessed chord of my being.&#xD;
Mr. Cardover came up; he did not mount the rocks-he&#xD;
looked at me; li had no words to say, but a smile broke from&#xD;
my heart.&#xD;
We gazed in a long silence.&#xD;
But it was time to go; how reluctantly II turned-even&#xD;
as II turned, II had a consciousness that old feelings would&#xD;
take possession of me. Mr. Cardover came forward to assist&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"No," I said, waving him away, "let me help myself."&#xD;
He bowed silently, and we wended our way to the car-&#xD;
riage, commenting for the first time upon the exceeding&#xD;
beauty of the scenery.&#xD;
We started again. A little brQwn Spire, surmounted by&#xD;
a golden cross, stood out in the noonday sky, showing us that&#xD;
we neared Blooming Hill; here and there a white or brown&#xD;
house peered out from a world of greenness. As we s1owl~&#xD;
drove along, we caine in view of an old stone dwelling, built&#xD;
after a comparatively ancient fashion; it was partially cov-&#xD;
ered with ivy: it brought old castles to mind, although its&#xD;
dimensions were not on an altogether magnificent scale. The&#xD;
grounds were well laid out; dark evergreens dotted them,&#xD;
contrasting with more airy, cheerful shrubbery.&#xD;
'~ Who lives here ?" I inquired.&#xD;
"Mr. Waldron's parents live here; he also lives here in&#xD;
the summer. The village was named from this place.&#xD;
Blooming Hill can hardly be called a village, there are so&#xD;
few houses."&#xD;
At this moment a lady and gentleman came cantering on&#xD;
spirited horses towards us. I soon recognized the dark rid-&#xD;

GRACE'S RADIANT FACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing dress, and white waving plume, as belonging to Grace.&#xD;
She came with a radiant face, her cheeks glowing, her eyes&#xD;
flashing with pleasure. We stopped a, moment for gay greet-&#xD;
ings, and then they escorted us on our way. Mr. Cardover's&#xD;
brother was so totally unlike him. He was tall, lank and&#xD;
ungraceful; his pale shining red hair lay smoothly upon his&#xD;
head; it curled up in a regular line around his neck; he was&#xD;
very good-natured looking, with projecting upper teeth, which&#xD;
were frequently shown in smiles. He was very wealthy, and&#xD;
had obtained his riches/by industry and happy fortune.&#xD;
A short ride brought us to his house. It was a square&#xD;
white building with a piazza aci~oss the front, and wings on&#xD;
each side. Grape-vines ran over the lattice work of the&#xD;
piazza, and climbed to the roof of the house. Fruit -trees&#xD;
abounded on the premises, but they were overshaded by&#xD;
magnificent oaks, elms and maples; roses were in their splen-&#xD;
dor, the air was redolent with fragrance; the summer-house&#xD;
was buried amid honey-suckle vines; comfort had been con-&#xD;
sulted every where.&#xD;
Mr. Seth Cardover assisted Grace from her horse. Miss&#xD;
Cardover stood in the door to welcome us. Her cordial&#xD;
smiles added heart to her words; she took us into the par-&#xD;
lors, untied my bonn9t, begged Grace to throw off her riding&#xD;
costume as speedily ~s possible, and wondered that we had&#xD;
not literally melted.&#xD;
"Why, we never thought of its being warm," said I, ap-&#xD;
pealing to Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"Nor did we observe the heat, Miss Grace," said Mr.&#xD;
Seth Cardover, in a tone of peculiar meaning.&#xD;
"Miss Cardover has mistaken the temperature!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Grace, laughing.&#xD;
When his brother had spoken, Pliny Cardover suddenly&#xD;
looked at him with a sort of inquiry, then he went to the&#xD;

window, and gave a very low whistle. I fancied he was&#xD;
mentally saying, "Hey, is it so, brother Seth?"&#xD;
I thought if brother Seth belonged to the class of gentle-&#xD;
men who are always on endearing and whispering terms with&#xD;
young ladies, I should come in for a share of his attentions.&#xD;
The dinner table deprived me of all hope: I saw that Graoe&#xD;
was unpleasantly conscious of monopolizing the thoughts of&#xD;
our host.&#xD;
Before we rose from the table he said, "Ladies, I am ex-&#xD;
ceedingly sorry to be obliged to leave my home at this time,&#xD;
when it is made so attractive by your presence."&#xD;
"How long shall you be absent, Seth?" ~tsked his sister.&#xD;
"About a week," he returned. "I ~hall depend on you,&#xD;
Pliny, to show the ladies about."&#xD;
"I'll do my best," said Pliny. "What say you, ladies&#xD;
bright; will you have a boat row this afternoon? Shall we&#xD;
go down to the beach, and tempt old ocean?"&#xD;
"Not to-day, Pliny," interrupted Miss Cardover; "let&#xD;
Kate get rested ~rst. To-morrow afternoon we will prevail&#xD;
on Mr. Waldron and his sister to accompany us. Wouldn't&#xD;
that be more' charming?" and she turned her cordial face to&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"Yes, it will be delightful." P secretly wondered if~Miss&#xD;
Cardover knew that Mr. Waldron had admired Grace.&#xD;
"Come, little maids," said she, as she rose from the table,&#xD;
"let us go in the parlor, and sew and talk-you may take a&#xD;
nap if you choose." We declined this indulgence, and she&#xD;
continued: "If we can't get rid of Pliny, he may read to us.&#xD;
Would you like that?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," we answered.&#xD;
Mr. Seth Cardover followed us to the parlor, and bade&#xD;
us "good-bye." His last glance rested on Grace; she&#xD;
dropped her pocket-handkerchief, and stooped to pick it up,&#xD;

&#xD;
that she might avoid the farewell of those eyes. Miss Car-&#xD;
dover and Pliny followed their brother to the door, where&#xD;
they stood and talked some moments.&#xD;
"Too bad, isn1t it?" said Grace, giving me a dismayed&#xD;
look.&#xD;
"V/hat?"&#xD;
"Why, that Mr. Seth Cardover has taken a fancy to me.&#xD;
I did not feel quite certain of it until to-day, or I should&#xD;
have shortened my visit. I shall go before he returns. I&#xD;
have enjoyed myself so much; Miss Cardover is a delightful&#xD;
companion."&#xD;
I ran up stairs to get my thimble; when ii returned,&#xD;
Grace and Pliny Cardover stood in the window; the latter&#xD;
had his back turned towards m~ ;-.--he was whispering to&#xD;
Grace, and her eyes were cast down: a timid, startled smile&#xD;
wads on her lips, and a warm, beautiful blush was deepening&#xD;
in either cheek. She stole ~'rom the window, and sat down&#xD;
by Miss Cardover. I retreated ~a step, a suspicion ~flashed&#xD;
across me, that tore from my ~naked heart the disguises I had&#xD;
thrown over it. I knew ev~ry expression that came to the&#xD;
countenance of Grace, and I saw that a love-light from within&#xD;
had suddenly flashed out. She loved again. I did not trem-&#xD;
lAe, or weep; and yet for an instant it seemed as if my sopi&#xD;
had lost all support. "Fool !" I murmured, and I set foot&#xD;
upon the anguish that rolled towards me ,-it must wait.&#xD;
"What are you going to read?" Ii asked, as II went in,&#xD;
and took my seat.&#xD;
"Here is a little poem by Mrs. Brooks, Kate. I'll read&#xD;
it, and see if you and Grace believe it." 1~h'~ Cardover read.&#xD;
"The bard has sung, (Thd never formed a soul&#xD;
Without its own peculiar mate to meet&#xD;
Its wandering half; when ripe to crown the whole&#xD;
flight plan of bliss, most heavenly, most complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
~ut thousand evil things there are that hate&#xD;
To look on happiness; these hurt, impede,&#xD;
And league with time, space, circumstance, anti fate?&#xD;
Keep kindred heart from heart, to pine, and pant, and bleed.&#xD;
And as the dove to far Palmyra flying,&#xD;
From where her native founts of Antioch beam,&#xD;
Weary, exhausted, longing, panting, sighing,&#xD;
Lights sadly at the desert's bitter str~ar~i ;-&#xD;
So many a soul o'er life's drear desert faring,&#xD;
Love's pnre congenial spring unfound, unquaffed,&#xD;
Suffers, recoils, then thirsty and despairing&#xD;
F what it would, ~lescends and sips the nearest draught."&#xD;
The words of this poem sounded like a requiem over my&#xD;
youth a d my joy. They defined vague thoughts; they said&#xD;
that thu~ should sweet prophesies of a glorious fate be tram-&#xD;
pled un er the heel of destiny; ambition in various shapes&#xD;
had floa ed before me; often had II dreamed of modest&#xD;
sources o tranquillity,.-.-now, Ii saw that the central hope had&#xD;
been slai , or had winged its flight away, and all lesser things&#xD;
had fallen to decay, even as the body becomes worthless&#xD;
when the spirit has departed. These thoughts preyed upon&#xD;
my spirit with a fearful power. I had reached the hour I&#xD;
had dreaded: all was perishing from my sight; the strength&#xD;
I had besought had gone with every treasure; courage had&#xD;
leaped from its throne; oh! to lay my faqe in the dust.&#xD;
And yet, a slow, steady fire gathered in myciieek, symboliz-&#xD;
ing the fire that was consuming my idols, Ii sat still and&#xD;
sewed, hearing with torture the conversation carried on by&#xD;
the happy hearts near me.&#xD;
"And you really believe that two souls are created for&#xD;
each other?" asked Grace, looking at Miss Cardover with&#xD;
sweetly, modestly shining eyes. "Would not such a belief&#xD;
induce disturbance in society?"&#xD;

MARRIAGE DISCUSSED.&#xD;
&#xD;
"flow so, Miss Grace?" questioned Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"Because mistakes are perpetually occurring. Two per-&#xD;
sons meet, and marry under the belief that they are made for&#xD;
each ot~ier. They are forced to change tbeir belief in their&#xD;
congeniality, and find thai they are painfully unlike in many&#xD;
respects that the heart holds most dear. If they believe&#xD;
your doctrine, they might feel themselves justified in separat-&#xD;
ing from each other, in breaking up the family, and robbing&#xD;
their children of a hearth and home. In fact, we hear of&#xD;
such cases frequently."&#xD;
I' We never hear of such cases, except among those who&#xD;
have some radical wrong at heart,-.except among those who&#xD;
hold in light esteem their sacred, lighted word, or are car-&#xD;
ried away by some enthusiasm that deprives reason of its&#xD;
just control. With our belief in this doctrine, we acknow-&#xD;
ledge that men and women cannot frequently avoid making&#xD;
mistakes in this world. We go to the altar, and swear be-&#xD;
fore Almighty God to be faithful until death; and if there be&#xD;
no crime committed, by which the law can separate, it is&#xD;
perjury to break the bond. When persons marry, they take&#xD;
upon themselves a holy mission to each other, and virtually&#xD;
promise to give no wandering fancies to any passer by. If&#xD;
their hopes are broken, it is a sad destiny, yet it is a risk&#xD;
which has been run ever since the world has stood. A&#xD;
second mistake might occur, a third, a. dozen. One has no&#xD;
right to marry, if he is not prepared to be "faithful unto&#xD;
death" under ordinary circumstances. Attachments are&#xD;
never formed after marriage without guilt, however platonic&#xD;
they may assume to be; for there is always an early time&#xD;
when the soul may start back from the precipice, and save&#xD;
its purity, ere it become too blind and infatuated. I have&#xD;
little patience with those who hold the legal tie of marriage&#xD;
in loose esteem; they have not the highest good of society at&#xD;
heart. They are not the self-sacrificing spirits who would&#xD;
&#xD;
I:&#xD;
&#xD;
"THE END IS NOT YET.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
171&#xD;
&#xD;
bleed in the cause of humanity,-.-they would rather dream&#xD;
on roses, than work out the problem of the world's redemp-&#xD;
tion. There are those who are too superficial and sensual&#xD;
ever to be satisfied with one."&#xD;
"And what would you do with such?" asked Grace.&#xD;
"Is their eternity spent with the~ chosen half?"&#xD;
"If spent with the chosen hail', certainly not in love,-&#xD;
such love as the blessed know. In one case, it would be a&#xD;
galling bondage, while in the other the reverse. If you ob-&#xD;
serve married pairs, you will see that only those who are&#xD;
heavenly-hearted retain through life, the first exquisite hap-&#xD;
piness of their union."&#xD;
"But it seems a dreadful thing," said Grace, "that two&#xD;
should live together, and find no happiness in each other's&#xD;
society,-that they should almost despise each other, or that&#xD;
* one noble spirit should be bound in chains to an inferior one,&#xD;
for a long period of years,-there are many such cases, where&#xD;
no gross wrongs exist."&#xD;
"There are," said Miss Cardover; "but, Grace, children&#xD;
often have parents who are a grief and shame to them, and&#xD;
yet it will not release a child from certain duties; and parents&#xD;
often have children who stab them to the soul daily~ yet a&#xD;
good parent for that reason will never cease to labor for the&#xD;
highest good of those whom God has given to his more pecu-&#xD;
liar care. 'The end is not yet;' we are in a school, and&#xD;
must expect to work amid difficulties, to aim in this life to&#xD;
secure our own highest spiritual development, and the best&#xD;
good of those around us, rather than to clutch happiness at&#xD;
the expense of holiest duty. Our faith in a world of com-&#xD;
pensation can buoy us up above every difficulty here. We&#xD;
are merely learning to live now, and the very woes that beset&#xD;
us, may become our best teachers. If the good and bad were&#xD;
not often mixed in closest affinity, the bad would lose oppor~&#xD;
tunities of amendment, while perpetual sunshine to the good&#xD;

HAPPINESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
would never deepen the virtues which spring from adversity.&#xD;
If those always met who were reculictr mates in this life,&#xD;
they might sail on the stream of content, and never reach&#xD;
that nobleness and worth which are tried in the crucible of&#xD;
suffering and contending fate. Until selfishness has been&#xD;
long warred against, we are not fit for perfect happiness,-&#xD;
we should grasp it, and shut our ears to the wailing cries&#xD;
that thronged the air. I know that many say, "they are&#xD;
good, while they are happy," which only means that they&#xD;
have never known themselves until evil overtook theta. In&#xD;
an adverse hour, the giants start from their caves in the&#xD;
spirit ;-amid the darkness and tempest, the heroic, the&#xD;
heaven-aspiring wrestle and conquer, while the supine are&#xD;
conquered, and confirm themselves in the belief that the&#xD;
giants never came, until the sun ceased to shine."&#xD;
I could bear the flow of conversation no longer: as I rose,&#xD;
Mr.~ Cardover turned his large eyes upon me with a sudden,&#xD;
searching light, and instantly withdrew them.&#xD;
"Where are yo~ going, pet?" asked Miss. Cardover,&#xD;
taking my hand, and looking at me with her frank; warm&#xD;
glance, which seemed always to love what it looked upon.&#xD;
"You said we might take a nap," I retui~ned; "so you&#xD;
will let me do that, or wander in the garden, Won't you?"&#xD;
"Yes, please yourself, my darling. Do just what you&#xD;
wish all the time you stay."&#xD;
I left them: they were smiling: it seemed strange to&#xD;
me that they did not divine the pain that had rooted itself&#xD;
in my being so deeply. I hastened to the lovely room ap-&#xD;
pointed for Grace and myself. How it would have charmed&#xD;
me with its snowy bed, pretty bureau, small pictures and&#xD;
fragrant bouquets, if the delicious hopes and romance of&#xD;
girWiood still belonged to me. Ii closed the door, and&#xD;
protracted myself by the low bedside-there I remained in&#xD;
dumb humility-in poverty. I had no words-no winged&#xD;
&#xD;
A PRAYER.&#xD;
&#xD;
178&#xD;
&#xD;
entreaties to send to the All-Father-no, tears. It was all&#xD;
over, and a dead calm like that which the mariner grows&#xD;
faint at beholding on the Pacific, had overtaken me. Life&#xD;
is expiring in such a calm. The green vines at the window&#xD;
softly moved to the summer air;' the birds tenderly twit-&#xD;
tered a hushed melody; it was mockery all, and yet as I&#xD;
listened I rose, took my sun-bonnet, and stole from the&#xD;
room. Ii left the house by a side-door, and wandered&#xD;
towards the dense woods that bounded the garden and&#xD;
meadow. Their solitude was what I wanted; on I went&#xD;
with hasty steps. 112 came~to a tiny stream, that flashed and&#xD;
sparkled in the sudden sunshine that broke through a rift&#xD;
in the foliage of the trees-then it lost itself in a labyrinth of&#xD;
wild willows. I thought it might lead me to the ocean, and&#xD;
I followed its course. I came to the beach, to the vast sea.&#xD;
It had lost its glorious anthem of the morning; it cbant~d&#xD;
tome no more; it said now, "I sang to you when a little&#xD;
hope slept undreamed of beneath your courage-you cannot&#xD;
hear me-never more!" So I yielded to tJ~e message, and&#xD;
sat down upon a stone, burying my face in m~y hands. My&#xD;
soul prayed, " Oh, if God would let me always sit here~ sit&#xD;
here until I die-.this is a fate dreary enough. I am not&#xD;
strong enough to contend-to dissimulate-to meet them."&#xD;
Then it passed through my mind, that I had sometimes&#xD;
thought of going South as a 9werness. I had a long time&#xD;
ago spoken to Cousin Mary and Grace about it, and they&#xD;
had dissuaded me from my purpose. Now it must be done,&#xD;
and Very speedily. A pale gray broke through the black-~&#xD;
ness of my despair as this relief came. I should be spared&#xD;
the torture of meeting them until I had learned to possess&#xD;
different feelings. With this thought I rose and started for&#xD;
the house.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
NIGHT came. Grace and, I slept together; my head rested&#xD;
on her arm; she talked to me a long time in a sweet, ram~&#xD;
bling w~ay that required little answer. I listened like one&#xD;
wearily imprisoned-stifled-panting~ for a place to breathe&#xD;
-*to weep: for the dead calm was py~ssing away. After she&#xD;
fell asleep I turned my face to the ~Vall, and tears flowed,~as&#xD;
my heart inwardly uttered,&#xD;
"No dreams for me henceforth and for ever! No sedu-&#xD;
cing brightness in the paths of earth-a terrible revelation&#xD;
has flashed through every hitherto hidden chamber of my&#xD;
being: no longer frank with others, I will speak to thee, my&#xD;
soul, and then weep in self-pity until my anguish is allayed.&#xD;
I love him, and through the midnight darkness the blush&#xD;
steals to my cheek as I acknowh~dge it: thus they deserve&#xD;
to suffer, who forget the delicacy of woman, and are won&#xD;
unwooed. And so over all the blasted hopes that have&#xD;
dropped from my tree of life, a mocking voice sounds, and&#xD;
yet at times I thought there was an unwanted kindness in&#xD;
his eyes when he turned to me-it was pity for my orphan&#xD;
estate and dependence. It seems some dreadful dream that&#xD;
holds me in thrall-some fearful magic that has changed my&#xD;
hopeful heart, and the whole universe with it. I could not&#xD;
help it. I suffer, because God permits it. I did not know&#xD;

ANGELIC TENDERNESS.             175&#xD;
&#xD;
how strong and wild was the spell that was silently enwrap-&#xD;
ping mc."&#xD;
Thus moaning, the iong night dragged along, and morn-&#xD;
ing dawned. 0-race awoke.&#xD;
"Why, Kittie," she e~c1aimed, "you look as if you had&#xD;
scarcely slept at all."&#xD;
"I think ]I am not well, Grace,." I said, hoping to attrib-&#xD;
ute my appearance to physical illness: in fact I was not&#xD;
well. "My head aches."&#xD;
"Don't get up. Let me bathe your head in cold water.&#xD;
Oh! you poor little thing, you look as if you felt so ill."&#xD;
She rose, threw up the window near the bed, shook up my&#xD;
pillow, and then bathe~f1 my brow with her gentle, caressing&#xD;
touches. She kissed me and spoke so tenderly. "We&#xD;
won't take our sail on the water to-day, if you. are not well&#xD;
enough to go, dear."&#xD;
"I ~liall get up presently," II returned; "this morning~&#xD;
air is reviving'"&#xD;
She left the room, and ere long returned laden with roses&#xD;
and a host of sweet flowers. She lovingly laid the most fra-&#xD;
grant roses on my pillow, and on the snowy counterpane:&#xD;
the rest she arranged in the vases: the brightest of all she&#xD;
placed on a little stand near the bed, where I could see it:&#xD;
then her gentle hands bathed my forehead again in cooling&#xD;
water. XVhen she ceased, she stroked my hair slowly as she&#xD;
talked. Beloved Grace! her angelic tenderness kept some-&#xD;
what more distant the sudden pangs of envy that had as-&#xD;
~'iiled me; her almost maternal manner soothed me. I&#xD;
kbdked at her as she moved about the room, and remembered&#xD;
that she had suffered as Ii was suffering. Could she have&#xD;
endured more? Yes, she was more cruelly situated. Ju-&#xD;
dith had a heart of iron towards her; but she, my noble&#xD;
Grace, she would have knelt and offered up her happiness to&#xD;
the Infinite Giveiy if duty demanded it. Her whole life&#xD;

A LETTEI~.                   17T&#xD;
&#xD;
176              THE SAILING PARTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed to say, "I live for you Heaven-I yield me to my&#xD;
Father's guiding hand."&#xD;
Could I b~ willing to take away her happiness? Should&#xD;
I allow any thing to stand between us? "Oh! my Father,&#xD;
spare me this!" I entreated. "Let me 5till feel that~ as&#xD;
destined angels we walk hand in hand through our different&#xD;
discipline. Let her still be the pure one who has led me&#xD;
upward. Save me from being ungrateful to her even in a&#xD;
transient thought; and some time, when I am better and ho-&#xD;
lier,~fill my soul with thankfulness for her joy-her beautiful&#xD;
joy.&#xD;
"Grace, dear" I said, "Jam going to leave my bower~of&#xD;
roses, but I bless you f~r placing them there just the same.&#xD;
Now let me kiss you w4h all my heart, dear, kind sister."&#xD;
She smilingly met my embrace, and then went down&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
In the afternoon we went on the ocean: a merry party&#xD;
we seemed in our sail-boat--ourselves with Mr. Waldron and&#xD;
his widowed sister. And none laughed more than I, .or&#xD;
dashed about the spray more recklessly. Grace sat beside&#xD;
Mr. Cardover; she said little, and when in a more quiet&#xD;
mood I looked at her, a pang, , an unconquerable pang struck&#xD;
my heart. Perhaps it was envy. It seemed as if a tender&#xD;
aura breathed around her-a soft angelic charm that waved&#xD;
above the buds of hope, springing momently to life within.&#xD;
I cannot express it, and yet the fluttering gladness of her&#xD;
exquisitely pure spirit was all comprehended by mine. It&#xD;
had upon me the effect of beauty, and yet it pained me-it&#xD;
awoke sweet visions of a capability for joy, with the knowledge&#xD;
that I must be for ever shut out from such a paradise. Mr.&#xD;
Cardover glanced at her often, and then hastily averted his&#xD;
eyes. I imagined the same sorrowful pain came across Mr.&#xD;
Waldron's heart that came to mine, but he sat next me and&#xD;
I dared not look at him. After, we reached home, I went&#xD;
&#xD;
into the parlor suddenly, and saw Mr. Cardover bending&#xD;
over the back of Grace's chair, speaking to her in a low&#xD;
tone-the same sweet, bashful look was in her eyes, and the&#xD;
same warm blush glowed in her cheeks.&#xD;
The next~ day we were invited to visit at Mr. Waldron's.&#xD;
His sister, Mrs. Ingersoll, rode over in the morning, and&#xD;
proposed it. She was the same pale, elegant-looking wo-&#xD;
man who had entered the church with her brother, the first&#xD;
time I saw them.&#xD;
It was a beautiful day, and we preferred walking to rid-&#xD;
ing. While we sat at work, wondering if it was time to get&#xD;
ready, Mr. Waldron and Mr. Cardover entered. They had&#xD;
met at the post-office, and the former walked home with&#xD;
Pliny to accompany us to his house.&#xD;
"There is a letter," said Mr. Cardover, holding one high&#xD;
above his head, and laughing at our eager loQks.&#xD;
"Here, Miss Kate!"&#xD;
I looked at it', but it was for Grace; it had on it a for-&#xD;
eign post-mark. I recognized Mr. Beuzoni's handwriting.&#xD;
"From Italy, Grace!" I said, in surprise, as I handed&#xD;
it to her.&#xD;
"From Walter, I imagine," exclaimed, Mr. Cardover&#xD;
"Devour it quickly, lady-birds, and then we will go out in&#xD;
this delicious air."&#xD;
Grace's eyes fell on the superscription, and every vestige&#xD;
of color left her face. She looked at it as if she were spell-&#xD;
bound.&#xD;
"Come," she said in a low voice, and I followed her to&#xD;
our room. As I passed Mr. Waidron, there was a pale anx-&#xD;
iety in his face; his eyes were riveted upon Grace with an&#xD;
expression that assured me her every heart-beat was a study&#xD;
for him.&#xD;
Grace flung the letter on the floor, and casting herself in&#xD;

A LETTER FROM BENZONI.&#xD;
&#xD;
a chair, buried her face in her hands, and gave way to pas-&#xD;
sionate weeping.&#xD;
j' Grace," I said, after a long silence, "why should this&#xD;
affect 'you so? You love him no longer."&#xD;
"No! oh no! it brought up all the past. Every feel-&#xD;
ing ~rushed over me-it came like a cruel signal to remind&#xD;
me of the slight hold I once had upon happiness-it recalled&#xD;
the skeleton 'ever sitting at the Egyptian banquet. And&#xD;
Kate, I will confess it, however inconsistent it may seem,&#xD;
that wild, intense love rushed over me like a torrent. But&#xD;
it is gone! Oh! that I' were sheltered; were safe in a ho-&#xD;
lier love. I fear that man, although I love him no longer;&#xD;
he once swayed my whole soul)'&#xD;
"He is married, Grace.'.'&#xD;
" Oh no, he would not write to me If Judith were living.&#xD;
She must be dead, and he has written perhaps that he is free&#xD;
now. Perhaps it would be better for me to send the letter&#xD;
back unopened; shall I, Kate?"&#xD;
"If it we~ mine, I should read it. I never could see&#xD;
any particular sense in sending back ~an unopened letter. It&#xD;
might have a totally different bearing from what was sup-&#xD;
posed. You can send it back without reply, or if you do&#xD;
not like this, you can send a second, one back unbrokeii."&#xD;
She broke the seal, and after reading it, gave it to me&#xD;
with firm lips and flashing eyes, saying, "Read' it, and tell&#xD;
me what you think." I read&#xD;
"BELOVED GRACE,-DO not start, heavenly one~ when&#xD;
this familiar writing falls beneath your eyes-it comes from&#xD;
one who has gleaned in his' wanderings only ashes to satisfy,&#xD;
his heart-from one who looks back with inextinguishable&#xD;
yearning for the peace that was about his steps, when the&#xD;
angel of his life sat beside him. You were and are that an-&#xD;
gel-you, and you alone have power to draw me from a hell&#xD;

PASSIONATE DECLARATIONS.&#xD;

&#xD;
of misery, and win me back to heaven. You used to talk&#xD;
of eternal repose. Grace ! if I never taste of either tem-&#xD;
porary or eternal repose, it will be your hand that thrusts&#xD;
me back among fiends. I am a reckless man-my destiny&#xD;
hangs upon' a thread. I am hopeless, unless hope comes&#xD;
from you. I have not the will or the strength to take an&#xD;
upward path without your help. I have lost faith in man&#xD;
and woman. I trust you! I turn to you, and read love&#xD;
and mercy in your soft eyes. In my miserable loneliness I&#xD;
pray to you as to some white-robed angel, who will fold my&#xD;
sinking head upon her breast, and bear me up to Heaven.&#xD;
Forgive the past! I was deluded by a siren-I was wiled&#xD;
away' from you, and from my better self at the same time.&#xD;
I have no excuse to offer, except that I was mad-infatuated.&#xD;
I have expiated that infatuation. I have repented with&#xD;
groans and tears-I have seen every hope blasted. My&#xD;
proud soul has bowed itself in the dust. Judith was un-&#xD;
faithful to me! Never before have those words escaped my&#xD;
lips, and never shall the world know my shame. She lives&#xD;
at iRome caressed and honored, the pitied, abandoned wife&#xD;
of Benzoni. She walks ~with care and prudence as yet, but&#xD;
her motions are watched, and ere long she will forget herself,&#xD;
and sin privately, while publicly winning the respect due to&#xD;
virtue. I shall never cease to watch her for my child's&#xD;
sake. My child! oh, Grace, would to God she inherited&#xD;
your ang~ 1ic r ure ;-would to~ God I had never seen her&#xD;
mother, then it we both have been spared bitter agony.&#xD;
You have -you have not forgotten me. You can-&#xD;
not! You lo, ~e still !-the wild, unconquerable love that&#xD;
springs to you at each instant of my life, kindles the same&#xD;
fervent glow within the heart that long since learned to re-&#xD;
spond to mine. Do not deceive yourself-do not turn away&#xD;
and think your being is divorced from mine. I hold you by&#xD;
a bond that can never be broken; a love that will seek you&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8254-00000091"/>&#xD;
until death, for you are mine, Grace, mine alone, and neither&#xD;
God nor the Evil One shall divide us now. Forgive this&#xD;
raving, angelic one. I will kneel at your feet, and beseech&#xD;
in more tender terms, but I cannot give you up. You can&#xD;
scarcely comprehend my passionate Italian nature. I live,&#xD;
I breathe bnt for you. All has been swept away, but one&#xD;
stake is left. I win you-.or die! Every hope, every fear,&#xD;
every thought, every feeling is concentrated upon the prize&#xD;
I seek-valued pricelessly, since the world holds none other&#xD;
for me. My angel! I hear you reason, and say it would be&#xD;
wrong to bless me while Judith lives, or while we are undi-&#xD;
vorced by law. You acknowledge that it is for eternity, not&#xD;
time that you live-for God's sanction, and not the world's&#xD;
praise or blame. Look within your heart, Grace, and ask&#xD;
where the wrong would be. Would it not be committing&#xD;
far more sin to drive me, a reckless, ruined wretch, upon the&#xD;
dangerous quk~ksands of temptation, than to guard me with&#xD;
your holiness ~nd purity? I cannot progress unless I am&#xD;
happy-unless I my affections are at rest. Why should hu-&#xD;
man happiness be sacrificed to existing laws? Why should&#xD;
I be chained to Judith, when she preys like a vulture upon&#xD;
the vitals of my happiness? Why should we be parted,&#xD;
when it would be exquisite happiness for us to b~ together?&#xD;
(I assum&amp;amp; that you love me still, Grace.) God desires man&#xD;
to be happy. The eyes of the law are more terrible to you&#xD;
than the str.on~ cry of a breaking heart. This world was&#xD;
not destined by the- Creator to be the prison-house of souls&#xD;
-it has been made so by the sins of mankind. The sin of&#xD;
livingamarriedlifewithoutlovehas crushed thousands f&#xD;
spirits-it is living a lie. It proceeds from a cowardice t at&#xD;
dare not brave the world; brave creatures weak and mor al&#xD;
as themselves. You, Grace, I believe have a heroism t at&#xD;
may elevate you above such. I feel a pure and, holy love or&#xD;

spiritually. It would be criminal and impure for me to seek&#xD;
any other, while my inner life cleaves to you. Let us rather&#xD;
cast off all bonds, all systems of doctrine, and trust only in&#xD;
the God who cares for our happiness. I have thought much&#xD;
upon this subject, and am convinced that I have the truth-&#xD;
sure that it would be right for us to live together. Can you&#xD;
be unforgiving, Grace? My whole life shall be devoted to&#xD;
your happiness. In placid, perfect content our lives shall&#xD;
pass. Your benevolent nature ~hall know no check until my&#xD;
fortune is exhausted in your service. We will prove to the&#xD;
world that goodness, purity and right may ~xist where per-&#xD;
sons are not bound by the mere figment of a ceremony, which&#xD;
differs wif~h every nation. I shall wait for your reply with&#xD;
intense impatience. Think well and deeply on this matter.&#xD;
If a favorable answer come, I shall fly to meet you, to hear&#xD;
you to any spot on earth you choose. Think of me, beloved,&#xD;
for not a thought shall wander momently from you. Angel,&#xD;
give me hope, or I ant lost, lost for time and eternity. I&#xD;
will not live if you turn from my prayers. Mark me, Grace,&#xD;

send an unprepared soul to judgment. If - gained, I shall&#xD;
become good and happy-devoted to my race. FarewelL&#xD;

I looked at Grace in utter astonishment. low little he&#xD;
had understood her. The fire had left her eyes, her hands&#xD;
were clasped on her lap, and tears were dropping-dropping.&#xD;
"Grate, what do you think of the letter?" I asked.&#xD;
"What do you think of his views?"&#xD;
"They arc false and delusive, yet I am not surprised&#xD;
that he entertains them. Kate, there is no vital centre of&#xD;
holiness in him to keep him right-to make him wise. He&#xD;
must be so wretched, so lonely, so unhappy. I thought it&#xD;
was only my happiness that Judith sacrificed."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Shall you return his letter?"&#xD;
"Perhaps I could say something to make him think life&#xD;
still worth living for-something that might awake some&#xD;
slumbering good within him, and give him courage."&#xD;
"You are always so sanguine, Grace. lit is a blessed&#xD;
thing to be so; but a case like' this is different. IL would&#xD;
not tamper with danger here-you are safe enough, but his&#xD;
hope must he crushed entirely. Do not open the door to&#xD;
pity. Send back the letter without a word."&#xD;
"But, Kate, he says he will not live if ".-.&#xD;
"Yes, I know he says so, and a great many healthy men&#xD;
have said the same thing before him."&#xD;
"But you know his passionate disposition, Kate. Sup-&#xD;
pose he ~should-.should---you know, Kate, Miss Cardover&#xD;
was telling us this morning about that German gentleman&#xD;
who committed suicide when her friend refused him."&#xD;
"Yes, but I have no fears of Mr. Benzoni. Perhaps I&#xD;
could write him a note that would change his fell intent."&#xD;
"What would you say?"&#xD;
"DEAREsT Mn. BENzoNI,-My cousin, Miss Percival, is&#xD;
rather pleased with another gentleman at present. She re-&#xD;
marked to me this morning that she thought if you would&#xD;
kill yourself, it might save her considerable annoyance.&#xD;
", Yours, with much esteem,&#xD;
"K. H."&#xD;
The color sp*~ad suddenly over the face and neck of&#xD;
Grace.&#xD;
"Did you guess that' I loved some one else?" she asked&#xD;
in a startled manner.&#xD;
"I guessed it," I replied, rising and going to the look-&#xD;
ing-glass to brush my hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How? Did my manner show it? I have tried to&#xD;
seem indifferent, for he has not said yet that he loved me."&#xD;
I did not answer: the wildest flood of emotion rushed&#xD;
over me; it rose higher and higher: it seemed as if my&#xD;
heart would burst. I knew 'the joy that was swaying the&#xD;
soul of Grace. She sat buried in delicious thought. At&#xD;
length she said, "Did you guess, Kate, that he loved me?"&#xD;
"Yes, I guessed so."&#xD;
Ii caught sight of her radiant face in the glass; and then&#xD;
saw my QWfl, filled with contending feelings. Grace came&#xD;
to me, and kissed my quivering lips.&#xD;
"I thought you would rejoice in the knowledge that we&#xD;
loved each other, Kate."&#xD;
It was too late; my self-control was gone. I flung my&#xD;
arms about her, and wept in an agony of passion. I cared&#xD;
not that the flood-gates had given way. What had one so&#xD;
hopeless and forsaken to do with pride?&#xD;
"I will 'not always be so selfish, Grace. I shall learn to&#xD;
look upon your happiness as I ought. 'But forgive me now!&#xD;
Have mercy on me for awhile. Do not speak to me about&#xD;
it!"&#xD;
"No, I will not, poor Kittie!"&#xD;
There was a rap at the door; it was only the servant,&#xD;
who said Miss Cardover and the gentlemen would be ready&#xD;
to go whenever we were. Grace had not turned to go to the&#xD;
door before I regretted intensely that I had betrayed myself.&#xD;
Ii would have given worlds to recall those tears.&#xD;
"I had no idea, Kate, that you would feel so badly about&#xD;
it," she said, returning. "Sister Mary cried just as hard,&#xD;
when I told. her that I was engaged to Mr. Benzoni. This&#xD;
is more uncertain than that seemed. We shall not be sepa-&#xD;
rated far; we can see each other every day."&#xD;
I 'breathed freely; she did not suspect the truth,&#xD;
was almost happy; or rather I was deeply grateful. We&#xD;

184             MR. BENZONI '5 RETURN.&#xD;
&#xD;
bathed our faces, and went down stairs like veiled nuns.&#xD;
Grace complained that the sun was so scorching without a&#xD;
veil, when Miss Cardover asked if we designed to ente~ a&#xD;
convent, and had been shriving each other of our sins for&#xD;
the last hour.&#xD;
"And have you been talking about 'Walter's letter all&#xD;
this time?" she continued, looking at Grace, whose coun~e~&#xD;
nance had regained its usual composure; her eyes showed no&#xD;
traces of tears through her veil.&#xD;
"Not all the time!" answered Grace. "The letter was&#xD;
not from Walter!" she added in an undertone. Mr. Wal~&#xD;
dron's ear caught her words,.-~he looked upon her with eyes&#xD;
of love, and read in her now calm face, traces of past emo-&#xD;
tion. We started from the house. ii stepped back from Mr.&#xD;
Cardover, who chanced to be next me. He and Grace&#xD;
walked together, while I went 'between Mr. Waldron and&#xD;
Miss Cardover. I felt as if protected by two good angels.&#xD;
"Did yoti know, Kate," said Miss Cardover, as we fell&#xD;
a little lcehind the couple in front, "that Mr. Beuzoni was&#xD;
in the country?"&#xD;
"Ne! how can it be?" 11 exclaimed in surprise.&#xD;
"He is here. Did you know him, Mr. Waldron?" and&#xD;
Miss Cardover looked at him.&#xD;
"I have met him.~~&#xD;
"11 received a letter from Lilly to-day, saying she had&#xD;
seen him. Grace does not know it, of course."&#xD;
"Oh no!" I answered.&#xD;
"I think our Grace was reserved for a happier fate than&#xD;
his wife might expect," Miss Cardover said. Mr. Waldron&#xD;
colored, but did not return the look or smile of Miss Cardover:&#xD;
she went on. "Lilly says that he stopped Gertrude in the&#xD;
street and asked a great many questions about Grace. I won-&#xD;
.der if Judith is with him. -We probably regrets his conduct."&#xD;
"I should think he ought!" I said. I concluded not to&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WALDRON ~S HOME.            185&#xD;
tell Grace at present that he was in America, and said, "Sup~&#xD;
posc we do not mention it. I hope they may not meet."&#xD;
"Why keep it from her?" asked Mr. Waidron.&#xD;
"I merely thought," I said, "that it might annoy her,&#xD;
and that it would be as well for her not to know it, until she&#xD;
goes back to Boston at least."&#xD;
"I would not make a secret of it, Miss Kate. What is&#xD;
he to her now'? only a despised acquaintance!"&#xD;
"Perhap~ I had better tell her.-I'll do so," I rejoined.&#xD;
I scanned my reluctance to telling her, and found my motives&#xD;
very confused. True, I thought it would perplex her, and&#xD;
destroy her pleasure; :but my strongest reason for silence&#xD;
was, that it might detain her at Blooming Hill longer, and&#xD;
subject me to the misery of seeing her and Mr. Cardover to-&#xD;
gether. 11 panted for freedom, and wanted to be alone du-&#xD;
ring the long, long night that I might pray and weep unseen.&#xD;
The strain upon my heart seemed hourly more than Ii could&#xD;
bear. I strove to act towards Mr. Cardover precisely as I&#xD;
had formerly done, and yet I found myself involuntarily&#xD;
shunning his presence whenever it was possible. Often&#xD;
some bitter word replied to the kind ones he addressed me,&#xD;
and then I trembled lest that bitterness should betray the&#xD;
conflict within.&#xD;
It was so beautiful and pleasant in Mr. Waldron's home;&#xD;
not luxurious, but suggestive of all the means of enjoyment&#xD;
that lie about hun~an beings,-and yet it seemed so sad to&#xD;
feel that what might once have awakened the liveliest plea-&#xD;
sure, now seems idlest nothingness to the craving heart. Mr.&#xD;
Waldron's mother sat by the window when we entered, her&#xD;
soft, hazel eyes beaming welcome,-her face was so filled&#xD;
with benevolence and intelligence, that I could scarcely feel&#xD;
how old she was,-how long her heart had beaten amid the.&#xD;
joys and sorrows of life. It seemed as if she must have&#xD;
known all the pains that meet us, as we walk the weary way&#xD;

of existence. II sat beside her, and as she talked with me,&#xD;
the sweet, holy calmness of her spirit breathed over me like&#xD;
a perfume. Her husband was older than herself, and per-&#xD;
fectly childish. It was a pleasure to note the quiet solici-&#xD;
tude which Mrs. Ingersoll and Mr. Waldron showed for his&#xD;
wants and whims. We went to the library, and were exam~~&#xD;
ning various curiosities; every thing which Mr. Waldron&#xD;
took down from the cabinet shelves to show us, his father&#xD;
took from his hand and first examined, then gate back with&#xD;
a satisfied look. There were many paintings in various&#xD;
rooms in the house, which Mrs. Ingersoll showed us, accor-&#xD;
ding to Miss Cardover's desire. Before every one, the old&#xD;
man stood a few minutes, then retired back until his son ex-&#xD;
pressed some opinion of another, when he took his stand be-&#xD;
fore it. Mrs. Ingersoll smiled, and said, "Father enjoys.&#xD;
this so much, it is a cheap way to make him happy."&#xD;
"I often wish from my heart," replied Miss Cardover,&#xD;
"that some of the flatteries given to~ the young and fair,&#xD;
could be transferred to the old."&#xD;
"Hey?" inquired old Mr. Waldron.&#xD;
"I am so pleased that you enjoy these paintings ~o much,"&#xD;
said Miss Cardover.&#xD;
The old gentleman looked greatly pleased, and said we&#xD;
must go into Horace's study. He led the way, and we fol-&#xD;
lowed. It was a room on the second floor; a dim~ religious&#xD;
light pervaded it. Retreating sunshine came from the west,&#xD;
through two large windows draped with heavy damask cur-&#xD;
tains. An arm chair stood within the embrasure of *one&#xD;
window, and upon it lay an open book. Upon the wall,&#xD;
nearly oppositee this inviting seat, hung an oil painting that&#xD;
arrested my attention instantly. It was a female face. Mrs.&#xD;
Ingersoll said it was called "Hope." It bore a striking&#xD;
semblar~ce to Grace, although the golden hair was unlike, and&#xD;
also th~ blue eyes,-the face was full of ethereal, angelic&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE ANN ~UNCEMENT.             187&#xD;
sweetness. None remarked ~he likeness, although I fancied&#xD;
all saw it. Grace looked at it a few moments, and then&#xD;
turned to another painting. She glanced at it across the&#xD;
room with wistful eyes, and deepening color;~ turning, she&#xD;
met the earnest gaze of Mr. Waldron. She blushed yet&#xD;
more deeply, with a conscious look, which I am sure she was&#xD;
sorry to betray.&#xD;
We came home in the summer twilight. I had been&#xD;
writing in our chamber half an hour, when Grace came in&#xD;
with her bonnet on, half breathless. "Where have you&#xD;
been?" I inquired.&#xD;
"Why, I forgot to send that letter back to Italy, before&#xD;
we started. I have heen to the post-office with it."&#xD;
I told ~her of Mr Benzoni's return.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
Tuoucurs or HORACE WALDnON.&#xD;
"Auo. l9th.-Tt is a moonless night; long since the twi-&#xD;
light has faded; long since the household has become noise-&#xD;
less. Quiet souls are walking in dream land, while I wake&#xD;
and dream, and look around my study, as if I could still see&#xD;
the presence that filled it to-day ;-the presence that fills ev-&#xD;
ery place I seek. I ho~e, and yet I fear. I dream that her&#xD;
spirit recognizes every pulsation, of my own, and bounds to&#xD;
meet me when I walk in 'woodland or I~y the sea, and read&#xD;
suggestions of herself in every thing that is beautiful. I&#xD;
dream that she listens, and catches the thoughts that spring&#xD;
to her, winged with love powerful, as it is pure. If' I were&#xD;
sure that she ~loved me, then could I 'believe that spirit&#xD;
reached unto spirit, and held communion. Even though she&#xD;
turned willingly from me, and I went away, I have not been&#xD;
able to believe that she would have done so, had she known&#xD;
my innermost soul, as it stands revealed before God. She&#xD;
was painfully pre-occupied; had I known her history then,&#xD;
I should not have sought her until the tempest had swept&#xD;
by. It has passed; leaving her free, enriching, rather than&#xD;
impoverishing her being. 'I was'strangely struck by an inci-&#xD;
dent that occurred after I had walked home with her to-&#xD;

day,; with her and Miss Cardover together, for I scarcely&#xD;
dare walk with her alone, lest Ii am not wholly welcome. I&#xD;
went to the post-office, and entered the inner room, where&#xD;
I stood talking with the postmaster on some business. A&#xD;
letter was handed in from the outside. The clerk took it up&#xD;
and read the direction, 'Giovanni Benzoni,' then threw it into&#xD;
the box where it belonged. I thought of Grace, for they&#xD;
were light footsteps that had tripped in, atid the color of the&#xD;
glove upon the small hand that thrust through the letter,&#xD;
was precisely like hers. I went out. ' It was Grace! She&#xD;
almost ran, for it was getting dark. I paused a moment,&#xD;
then followed her. I knew, I know still that she must have&#xD;
had some innocent motive for communicating with him, yet&#xD;
it struck a dagger to my hopes. Mayhap his wife has died,&#xD;
and he seeks her again. She is so exquisitely pure Ii cannot&#xD;
believe her spotless heart turns to him; an angel could not&#xD;
link the sweetest affections' to a spirit of evil-in her hopeful&#xD;
innocence she has thought to do him some good. Beautiful&#xD;
Grace, it is here that you need my care, and love, and more&#xD;
worldly wisdom, and I have need of your ardent, guileless&#xD;
impulses. I sometimes look around this old home of my&#xD;
father's, and dream of the change that would come over its&#xD;
aspect, if it were glorified with the constant presence of my&#xD;
beloved-my wife-.so II 'call her, so I yearn to call her&#xD;
throughout all eternity-in the fervor of my solitary thoughts&#xD;
I cannot even think of our destiny as a separate one. A&#xD;
holy and beautiful revelation of womanhood she has been to&#xD;
me-~-.-through her a glory has shone upon me, penetrating&#xD;
into every lost retreat, as lights suddenly change a dark&#xD;
cave into a temple rich in arabesques, columned aisles, and&#xD;
fretted ceilings flashing with gems set in waving silver. I&#xD;
look with intensest longing upon her lovely face and form,&#xD;
which are to me so suggestive of richer, more heavenly life&#xD;
-.I[ look, hoping ~to read in~ her countenance her soul's&#xD;

&#xD;
full response to mine. At times I think I catch the an-&#xD;
swer; the electric chain draws her near me, thrilling me&#xD;
with the conviction that we shall part no more for ever;&#xD;
again I see in her manner an absence of i4erest, and a dread&#xD;
falls upon me lest I have taken the graceful embarrassment&#xD;
which every modest woman feels upon an undesigned show&#xD;
of love from one of our sex, for more than it warrants.&#xD;
Upon my inward world, she has risen as the first Eve arose,&#xD;
an exponent of that mystic beauty and bliss which the soul&#xD;
thirsts after. If I should lose her, I shall still believe that&#xD;
God placed in her white hand the key that has opened&#xD;
the ~ioblest depths of my being: I shall strive to bear the&#xD;
burden of life as one not unworthy the holy love she has&#xD;
awakened.&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
'WE sat in the summer-house and sewed, while Grace read&#xD;
to us "The Ancient Mariner." Suddenly Mr. Seth Car-&#xD;
dover appeared in our midst with Lilly, whom he had brought&#xD;
from the city; beautiful, bewitching Lilly-all met her with&#xD;
kisses and sunny smiles: my heart clung to' her in her bright&#xD;
innocence. Pliny Cardover 'followed his brother. Lilly&#xD;
bounded away from us, and went wandering towards the gar-&#xD;
derv I went after her under the pretext of keeping her out&#xD;
of mischief. We strolled about 'hand in hand, gathering&#xD;
blossoms and berries; we sat down under a favorite oak tree,&#xD;
and I told her stories, weaving in the mystic and pure, until&#xD;
within her eyes there grew a wistful look, precursor of the&#xD;
earnest gaze she would yet cast upon existence.&#xD;
When the sun threw soft, lengthened shadows upon the&#xD;
grass, I said, "Shall we go to the post-office, Lilly, to see if&#xD;
there are any letters? I would like to walk."&#xD;
Lilly agreed to the proposition,~ and we hastened to the&#xD;
house to get ready. I had written an advertisement that I&#xD;
'wished to forward to the city in reference to ~a situation as&#xD;
governess. I had consented to Miss Cardover's urgent so..&#xD;
limitation to remain with her a few days after' Grace left. I&#xD;
was glad of the opportunity of being separated from Grace.&#xD;
I hoped in the mean time to gain a more heayenly spirit of&#xD;
self-renunciation..-..to learn to love without expecting a great&#xD;

return. I wished also to write to the family that my pur-&#xD;
pose was fixed to go. South; IL wanted the surprise over by&#xD;
the time I went home. So Lilly and ill went to the post-&#xD;
office, and I deposited my document, obtaining a few letters&#xD;
and papers in return.&#xD;
As we neared the gate, on our way home, Pliny Cardover&#xD;
came to meet us; he did not look pleased. "I was requested&#xD;
to ascertain your whereabouts, Lilly!" he exclaimed. " Tea&#xD;
is ready, Miss Kate."&#xD;
"Grace is going to-morrow," said Mr. Cardover, more&#xD;
amiably, vs he took Lilly's disengaged hand. "My sister&#xD;
will not give you up yet."&#xD;
"She expects me to stay," I answered.&#xD;
"Grace is going to leave with me in the morning. You&#xD;
will miss her."&#xD;
"Yes," I thought he iiitended to give me an oppot'tu-&#xD;
nity of conversing frankly about hts attachment' to her, but&#xD;
I did not desire any confidences. 11 added, "You have now&#xD;
the promise of a beautiful day."&#xD;
"Yes, we shall have a charming drive. You are less&#xD;
social than Grace, Miss Kate. Does the world of nature&#xD;
excel the world that is in human souls?"&#xD;
"Oh no," I replied, "bitt Ii am always enchanted to* get&#xD;
in the country. You forget that I have been shut up among&#xD;
brick walls a great While. We ladies are with each other&#xD;
all day~ when the su4 shines hotly, but about this time it is&#xD;
so pleasant, for rambling 11 can hardly resist it. I think the&#xD;
others do not always care about going with me."&#xD;
"Business will detain me in the city all the time now&#xD;
for ~ month; our fall trade is beginning. But Ii will come&#xD;
out any day to drive you home, if you will send me a line."&#xD;
"Thank you."&#xD;
"Will you send me a line?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I would like to go in the cars for a change, so I will&#xD;
not trouble you."&#xD;
"Very well," he replied briefly. We walked on in ~i-&#xD;
&#xD;
lence.&#xD;
During the evening I took good care not to absent my-&#xD;
self. Grace was up stairs packing her trunk, lit was late&#xD;
when II went to heir. Everything was ready for an early&#xD;
departure in the morning, bat Grace looked sad and dis-&#xD;
tressed.&#xD;
"I have evil forebodings, Kate," she said, as I took a&#xD;
seat and laid my hand on the little Bible we were in the&#xD;
habit of reading together, before going to bed.&#xD;
"Why evil foreboQings?" I asked.&#xD;
"I have seen Mr. Benzoni to-night!"&#xD;
"Where?"&#xD;
"In the summer-house. Immediately after tea I came&#xD;
up stairs to pack. II missed something, and remembered IL&#xD;
must have left it in the summer-house this afternoon. It&#xD;
was not dark, and Ii hastened to find it. I met Mr. Benzoni&#xD;
in the door. It was like an apParition-he caught me in&#xD;
his arms and drew m~ within, before I could recover from&#xD;
my surpi~ise. Then he released me, and fell at my feet, pour-&#xD;
ing out a torrent of passionate words.&#xD;
Let me go!' If said, for he held my dress.&#xD;
" ' Not until you have listened to me,' he returned. 'A&#xD;
good angel sent you to me the moment' II arrived. Ii saw&#xD;
your steps were bent here, and II came in at the other door.&#xD;
I could not wait your answer to my letter; II came over in&#xD;
the same vessel.'&#xD;
"'It was an idle errand. I sent ba~~k your letter without&#xD;
reply. Now, leaVe me!' I said, rising, for I had at first&#xD;
sunk upon a seat.&#xD;
" ' This is affectation ! ' he answered, letting go his hold,&#xD;
but standing so near that I could not escape.&#xD;

"' It is truth that I value you for what you are,' I re-&#xD;
plied. 'II loved y9u once, for what yoa were not. Ii should&#xD;
shudder to be what you would have me, even if I loved you.&#xD;
I would have died rather than have degraded my soul by&#xD;
accepting your specious reasoning as truth.'&#xD;
"'Grace, the world is changing fast,' he said, as if al-&#xD;
ready prepared for resistance. 'I do not ask you to do&#xD;
wrong. There is nO law for love. I[ know your constant&#xD;
heart; you are incapable of change; you love me still. The&#xD;
purest women that ever breathed, the most intellectual, have&#xD;
found no sin in free love-they rather find a deadly wrong&#xD;
in marriage without love.'&#xD;
"I attempted to' spring past him, but he caught my arm,&#xD;
arid detained me, saying, 'Forgive me, dear Grace. . Thjnk&#xD;
of the past, think of the hours when your head rested upon&#xD;
my shoulder-when you told me all your pure thoughts. I&#xD;
have sinned and sorroweci since then. ]I have come back a&#xD;

"'Life or death, Grace ~'&#xD;
~" 'Death, if sin and life ~go together!' Ii spoke with an&#xD;
angry energy that convinced him of my earue~tness. He&#xD;
struck his forehead, and dropped into, a seat, trembling. II&#xD;
could not help pitying him. Kate, that proud man wept as&#xD;
I never saw a man weep. I stood and looked at him, rivet-&#xD;
ted to the ~pot with a compassion so powerful that I could&#xD;
not turn away. He, whom I once loved so deeply-to see&#xD;
the wreck he was. Blasted hopes and bitter memories&#xD;
making up his life-no golden, eternal future to cheer him&#xD;
onward.&#xD;
"'I wish you were less i~nhappy,' II said, as he bowed his&#xD;
head upon his cksped bands. I besought him with words I&#xD;
cannot remember now, still to have faith in God, and in his&#xD;
own capabilities for goodness and happiness. I told him&#xD;
that I forgave him freely. After a pause he asked,&#xD;

THE CURSE.                  19~&#xD;
"'If I were divorced, Grace, would you marry me?'&#xD;
~' I trembled under his fiery, determined glatice, but I&#xD;
answered, 'I would not, Giovanni, I have ceased to love&#xD;
you.'&#xD;
"His gaze riveted itself upon me, as if he would win&#xD;
back the power he once possessed over me; I looked towards&#xD;
the house and felt his grasp again upon the sleeve of my&#xD;
dress.&#xD;
"'You love some one else?' he inquired, slowly.&#xD;
"I did not answer, but felt that a tide of crimson swept&#xD;
up to my brow. He rose to his feet with a curse that star-&#xD;
tled me-a deep and dreadful malediction. I sprung from&#xD;
'him and fh1~ d. But oh, Kate, that sudden tone, betraying a&#xD;
~nine of wild passion within, haunts me like a prophecy of&#xD;
evil. II feel as if he had stepped between me and happi-&#xD;
ness some way-I feel as if some great, dark shadow had&#xD;
fallen upon my joy. Do you believe, Kate, that when per&#xD;
sons love each other, and intensely think of each other, they&#xD;
are in any way eonsciou~ of the state of mind, experienced&#xD;
by each ?"&#xD;
"I don't know," I answered, taking up the little Bible&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I believe it," said Grace, "or rather I fear it. Per-&#xD;
haps it is no presentiment; perhaps I am only looking at the&#xD;
future through a gloomy medium."&#xD;
"Probably you are, Grace," I said. "I have often seen&#xD;
portentous shadows that amounted to nothing! More fre-&#xD;
quently I have had a presentiment of bright tidings that&#xD;
never ~came."&#xD;
A night's repose served in some meas1~re to restore the&#xD;
spirits of Grace. We had an early breakfast, and then in&#xD;
the cool, delicious morning, we assembled on the piazza to&#xD;
see our friends start. How handsome and suitable they&#xD;
looked as they bowea adieu from the carriage. Mr. Cardo-&#xD;

196                   MY AUNT.&#xD;
ver carefully drew Gracc's dress from the ~vheel, that it&#xD;
might not get soiled-this little action reminded me that she&#xD;
would always be shielded by his manly care and love. And&#xD;
so they ro4e away under the azure heavens, under the east-&#xD;
ern sunlight, amid bird songs and exulting vojecs of nature&#xD;
- amid freshening dews and air-laden perfumes. Thus it&#xD;
ever is; some hearts laugh, while others weep. II turned a&#xD;
compassionate look towards the far-distant stone house, al-&#xD;
most hidAen by foliage. There dwelt one heart that was&#xD;
telling the same pitiful strokes that mine was telling that ju&#xD;
bilant summer morning.&#xD;
Lilly asked as she dan&amp;amp;cd in the house, "Will they ever&#xD;
be married, Aunt Lizzie?"&#xD;
"Ask KateP replied Miss Cardover, ~ith a smiling look&#xD;
of inquiry at me, "I presume she knows more about it than&#xD;
I do, a great deal, Lilly."&#xD;
"I don't jinow, Lilly," I answered, quickly.&#xD;
"Well, if they should," pursued Lilly, dant4ng back to&#xD;
me, "wouldn't Miss Grace be my aunt?"&#xD;
Yes, Lilly."&#xD;
"And if you should marry Uncle Seth, wouldn't you be&#xD;
my aunt, Miss Kate?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes," II responded, with an iiwoluntary smile,&#xD;
glancing at Uncle Seth with a wouldn'tt I ?"&#xD;
"Yes,~ if such a thing should happen!" answered he&#xD;
with a slightly distressed look. I believe he had a fear that&#xD;
I might attack his ~ffe~tion5. He took his hat attd went&#xD;
away, ~while we went in the parlor.&#xD;
Oh, Kittie! what an entrancing morning ! My heart&#xD;
sings a new song unto the Lord on such days ~s this. There&#xD;
springs up a well of joyousness within me. Let us sit in&#xD;
this eastern light; it pours through the vines and into the&#xD;
room so pleasantly." Thus spoke Miss Cardover, as we&#xD;
went into the room; her whole nature seemed to overflow&#xD;
&#xD;
with youth, strength and exultation; it did me good. "How&#xD;
is it," I mentally asked, "that she can be so happy, so fresh,&#xD;
so delighted with life? Jiow caii her sunny, affectionate&#xD;
heart 1)C content without the prospect of being beloved ?-&#xD;
the realization of a dreani of hope and joy to a noble na-&#xD;
ture ?-the star of existence to sonie yearning heart ? Oaly&#xD;
the world-hardened cease to crave holy love, and very piti-&#xD;
ful it is to ~seo the sweetest blossoms of romance and youth&#xD;
buried within an ossified heart."&#xD;
"Life seems to satisfy you fully, Miss Cardover," I said,&#xD;
'~ it is spripg-time in your soul all the tinie. I never find i~&#xD;
so altogether with those of my own age, and yet I have al-&#xD;
ways been taught to believe that youth was the halcyon&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"It is a great mistake, my dear; it was intended that&#xD;
we should grow lovelier and happier every year,. but the&#xD;
original intention of omiir Lord has been sadly marred by his&#xD;
misguided children. We begin life full of unlovely tenden-&#xD;
cies; after passing under the rod, we ought to lose some of&#xD;
them, and approach a little nearer Eden innocence and hope;&#xD;
if ~ve do not, then have we never learned the object of our&#xD;
creation."&#xD;
"But we grow old, and no one cares very much for us&#xD;
then-and then we die."&#xD;
"Then we begin to live, if we have obeyed the. ~divine&#xD;
commaiid to love God and our neighbor."&#xD;
"To live?" I said, thrilling under the hopes that had&#xD;
died out of my heart. "Yes, but there is a great gulf' be-&#xD;
tween now and the rt."&#xD;

that it had fallen."&#xD;
"Why did you thank Him?"&#xD;
"Because the anguish I suffered made me fly to 'Him; it&#xD;
developed my spiritual nature, and led me finally to recog-&#xD;
nize the myr~a4 buds of hope that la~ under the cold clay&#xD;
of worldliness a celestial light and warmth streanmd with-&#xD;

upon my brothers and sisters in the universe with an inter-&#xD;
est and entljusiasm altogether new. I desired that they&#xD;
should learn the blessed truths ii saw-should learn that joy&#xD;
lay in the future if they would labor fizir it."&#xD;
"Did you never love again?" I questioned, not quite&#xD;
understanding what the source of this joy was.&#xD;
"No, ]I never did."&#xD;
"You may still. You are comparatively young yet."&#xD;
"II do not expect to until I entei~ that' world where heart&#xD;

"Do you expect tO be a beloved bride there?" I ques-&#xD;
tioried, returning her smile.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"The bride of Ihim you loved?"&#xD;
"Was he unworthy of you ?"&#xD;
"Far from it. It was an attachment formed at school;&#xD;
we were engaged at fifteen. As. we grew older I saw that I&#xD;
was not the one he would have chosen; II had. an irritable,&#xD;
independent way sdmc years ago that was not agreeable ;I&#xD;

may comO forth serene and good some time. Did he leave&#xD;

"He never would have broken our childish bond him-&#xD;
ceif: he was too delicate for that; I saw that he tried to&#xD;
love me, tried to be satisfiQd with me. When I became con-&#xD;
vinced of this, I gave him his freedom.' That was many&#xD;
years ago, Kate. I remember the day so well; he was com-&#xD;
ing to take a ramhle with me; this house of Seth's was&#xD;
new, and I was here making a visit. I had the room you&#xD;
have now, Kate'; that afternoon I knelt in wild supplication&#xD;
for strength. He came, and we went in yonder woods-do&#xD;
you see them?"&#xD;
"Yes!&#xD;
"There I 'told him our ~ngagement must be broken, for&#xD;
a conviction had been growing upon me daily that we were&#xD;
unsuited to each other. I did not find in myself a consent&#xD;
to be his wife. 'His pale, handsome face flushed, and he&#xD;
took my hand, and bending over it, kissed it; when he&#xD;
looked at me again there were tears in his eyes.&#xD;
"'You are dear to me, Lizzie!' he said, 'you link my&#xD;
childhood with my manhood. I do not satisfy you?'&#xD;
"'I am not satisfied,' I returned very calmly, for an icy&#xD;
composure had come over me. 'You are good, angelic, but&#xD;
we are not suited to each other. Give me a brother's love;&#xD;
I will be a friend, if not a wife. Leave me now! Say no&#xD;

"He held thehmand he had taken a moment, and looked at&#xD;
in ~ very earnestly, then he folded me to his heart, and&#xD;

ger, Ii cast myself upon the autumn leaves that strewed the&#xD;
earth, and groaned over my work."&#xD;
"Have yo~ ever regretted it?" I asked, in a hushed&#xD;
vomee.&#xD;
"I regretted it at first, when I found myself so weak-&#xD;
heart-wrecked, with shivered hope~ lying around me. I am&#xD;
more than satisfied now, for I realize that heaven did not&#xD;
create us for each other. I wait tree and untramelled now&#xD;
for my true bridal hour. I wait to meet my beloved!"&#xD;
"Where? who is he?"&#xD;
"Kitty dear, perhaps the time may come when the spirit-&#xD;
world will seem as real to you as this world-when you will&#xD;
understand how this material case, your outermost body will&#xD;
be thrown off, like a shell from the tender seed. When you&#xD;
realize this, you will comprehend that Ii look towards heaven&#xD;
with an assurance of human joy that seems strange to you&#xD;
now. Men and women are dissevered halves, and their&#xD;
destiny is l4ot accomplished until each half is mated to its own,&#xD;
so ]i shall meet mine some time: he may be on earth, 'toil-&#xD;
ing, rejoicing, sorrowing,' and he may be in heaven. I am&#xD;
not impatient! If I meet him first in heaven, I shall be&#xD;
beautiful and young, and no dark river will temporarily di-&#xD;
vide us. We shall both grow more worthy with time; at&#xD;
least, I pray so."&#xD;
"Now," Ii said,. "I understand the youthful freshness~ of&#xD;
your nature; your life is filled with virgin thoughts and&#xD;
holy, innocent aspiratiotis. You believe in heaven and joy&#xD;
because God's sacred word has been the light that has flowed&#xD;
in upon you, when your more interior being was opened; you&#xD;
look up to him lovingly, as a Father who gives good gifts&#xD;
unto his children."&#xD;
"As one obeys His will, appreciation of Him, and faith&#xD;
in the sweetness of our destiny spring up together."&#xD;

"lie is living, and he is not married! I think, K a~e,&#xD;
that it is well enough for those who love, to marry, even~f&#xD;
they are not created for each other! Pairs seldom meet on&#xD;
earth, and many cannot live without some affection; they&#xD;
expand undoiT the cheering light of kindly eyes-they can&#xD;
bless each other, and strengthen ea cli other in purity and&#xD;
holiness. l3ut I think it is better to live single, unless the&#xD;
affection is very pure and strong, or unless there is a pros-&#xD;
poet 9f doing a deep and gentle good to the earth-coin-&#xD;
panion."&#xD;
It s~oins very beautiful to me to see you waiting in&#xD;
~w~h happy patience for your marriage with the true partner&#xD;
of your being." I said, "I shall do so, if I am strong enough&#xD;
to live unloved."&#xD;
"You will not be, my Kate!"&#xD;
"Why!" Ii asked, coloring deeply. I could not conceive&#xD;
that I could ever ft ye another than I did; I could not con-&#xD;
ceive that there was a soul with a more really close affinity&#xD;
to mine than the one I loved: it flashed over me that when&#xD;
I became a beautiful angel Pliny might recognize this affinity&#xD;
-Grace might belong to another. God might permit her to&#xD;
be Pliny's bettor angel on earth. As Ii spoke to Miss Car-&#xD;
dover, a servant called her from the room. I looked out&#xD;
upon the radiant earth, and my heart smiled as if under the&#xD;
light of a ~ew firmament; but the words rose over my soul,&#xD;
"Worship in the true temple of to-day."&#xD;
Then I went to my room, and repeated the holy prayer&#xD;
that had sustained ni&amp;amp; before, that I might love Grace and&#xD;
Mr. Cardovor as a sister, yielding a consent to be lovod less&#xD;
in return. It was very hard to pray thus; but when I prose&#xD;
from my knees, a purer life had descended into my spirit,&#xD;
and Ii felt earnestly desirous to become good and hngelic in&#xD;

nature, as our Father would have us. I thanked Him that&#xD;
He had led me in my hour of suffering to a happy, brave&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
The days wore on, and I was borne up in the arms of a&#xD;
strong angel, the while she knew it not; she apprehended'&#xD;
that she did me good, and gave me courage, but. this she&#xD;
had done very often for others, and it was not remarkable to&#xD;
her that she blessed me.&#xD;
The morning for my departure came. An hour brought&#xD;
n~ to my old home-it seemed a gloomy, brick prison--it was&#xD;
as painful to return to it as it had been to leave it. II&#xD;
opened the sitting-room door, and read on all the faces gath-&#xD;
ered there, the smiling ~unshine of affection; they sprang&#xD;
forward to kiss and embrace me! How my heai~t reproached&#xD;
me! After the first gl~w of meeting was over, they ex-&#xD;
claimed,&#xD;
"Kitty, can you leav d us?"&#xD;
And I inclined my head with a smile and gathering tears,&#xD;
not daring to speak. Often that first day, I bit my lips,&#xD;
and started for a glass of water, to dispel the tide of sud-&#xD;
den feeling that came over me; the family could not com-&#xD;
prehend the eager ~nu.st within me; but when they found&#xD;
I was determined, they seemed to give to my. motives a no-&#xD;
bleness which they lacked; their beautiful charity interpreted&#xD;
the conduct I could not explain.&#xD;
"Without doubt, Kate," said cousin Mary, "you will ~s&#xD;
you desire, go on a mission to careless hearts that know no-'&#xD;
thing of life's ~real worth; I hope you, may open to thirsting&#xD;
natures the pure wells of truth so seld6m found by the way-&#xD;

field may need you; we will try to strengthen you in your&#xD;

Mr. Cardover came to spend the evening. After re-&#xD;

chamber, to ponder upon the three letters that offered me a&#xD;
situation. One home was in the sunny South, not far re-&#xD;
moved from the city of S-~----~-. This I favored; the letter&#xD;
was written with a graceful politeness that the others lacked;&#xD;
they hired me, this treated me as if my nature was not very&#xD;
far removed from mortals in general. The letter was written&#xD;
by a gentleman, and' signed "Philip Henry;" he had three&#xD;
children who would need my care. I hastily wrote a letter&#xD;
giving some particulars which had been omitted, and making&#xD;
some inquiries, then the duties of the day. were over.&#xD;
The next afternoon II received a decisive answer. I was&#xD;
to go South for a year at least. In a few days I should&#xD;
leave home. There were various items to ~bn attended ~o, so&#xD;
I put on my bonnet and went out shopping. It was dusk&#xD;
before I had finished my business. As Ii hurried home&#xD;
through the crowded streets, a pair of boots went clink&#xD;
clink after inc. I turned into a more private street; then a&#xD;
hand touched my arm. It was Mr. Bcnzoni! "Will you&#xD;
walk with me one moment, Miss 1-Jamilton?" he asked.&#xD;
"I cannot! "I replied.&#xD;
"Will you obtain me an interview with Grace?" he&#xD;
asked, impatiently.&#xD;
"You have already been' at the house, and she refused to&#xD;
see you!" I answered.&#xD;
"But I have now that td communicate which will change&#xD;
her feeling!"&#xD;
"What is it?" I inquired, for the first time looking in&#xD;
his eyes: the street lamp beneath which we stood shone on&#xD;
his pallid face.&#xD;
"Madame Benzoni is dead. I learned it by the last&#xD;
steamer&#xD;
I doubted hi's word, and asked, "How did she die?"&#xD;
"By cholera!"&#xD;
I shuddered, and would have left him, but he asked eager-&#xD;

ly, "Will you arrange matters so that Grace can meet me&#xD;
somewhere?"&#xD;
"she will not meet you."&#xD;
"She will, if you advise her to do so. Will you?" he&#xD;
spoke thickly, as if agitation or the wine-cup had mastered&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" No ! " I said.&#xD;
An angry light shot across his face: he clenched my arm,&#xD;
and said, "You must do it !~"&#xD;
"You are very chivalrous," I said, scornfully; but Ii&#xD;
could hardly suppress a scream, he held my arm so tightly.&#xD;
He laughed bitterly, but kept my arm in his possession,&#xD;
although he held it more lightly. He said, "It is you who&#xD;
have prejudiced her against me. Answer me, have you not&#xD;
persuaded her not to see&#xD;
i' She needed no persuasion, after having seen you once.&#xD;
Let go my arm, will you?"&#xD;
"Will you persuade her to see me?" his eyes glared&#xD;
down on me with~ a determination that frightened me, Not&#xD;
~being addicted to great courage, dreadful things flashed&#xD;
through my mind, What if he were demented, and should&#xD;
put his other hand in his pocket, take out a knife, and stab&#xD;
me to the heart. I trembled from head to foot. lie s~w my&#xD;
fear, and spoke more gently.&#xD;
"I am not happy: I am not as I was. Have you no&#xD;
pity?"&#xD;
"I do pity you: but Grace cannot see you, or be axiy thing&#xD;
to you. Why not give her up? Why not interest yourself&#xD;
in some other pursuit? Why not turn your thoughts in&#xD;
another direction? You can, if you will."&#xD;
"I cannot!" he said.&#xD;
"Won't you please to let me go?"&#xD;
"Persuade Grace to see me."&#xD;
&#xD;
t'1&#xD;
&#xD;
"11cr heart is entirely given to one who loves her in re-&#xD;
turn.~~&#xD;
" Oh, God! " he said, loosening his hold. He reeled&#xD;
against the lamp-post. Dreadful things flashed over me&#xD;
again. If he should fall down, what should I do? I looked&#xD;
up the street, saw a man coming, and darted towards him,&#xD;
catching his arm.&#xD;
"Oh, sir!"I panted.&#xD;
"Cood heavens, Kate! what is the matter?" said the&#xD;
voice of Mr. Cardover. I was instantly reassured by meet-&#xD;
ing a friend so opportunely, and paused to catch breath.&#xD;
T looked around to see the condition of Mr. Beuzoni: he was&#xD;
walking away. Poor man!&#xD;
"Let us t~ikc this street," I said, and we turned int6 a&#xD;
cross street.&#xD;
"How you tremble, Kate; what was it?"&#xD;
Ii related the incident.&#xD;
"You ought not to have been out at this hour alone.~'&#xD;
"I was unexpectedly detained."&#xD;
"Do I walk too fast for you?" he kindly inquired.&#xD;
"Grace tells me you are going South to teach."&#xD;
"Yes, I am."&#xD;
"I thought you were too much attached to your home to&#xD;
leave."&#xD;
"I think there is a spice of the rover in my composition.&#xD;
I look' forward with great satisfaction to my gypsy life. I&#xD;
am tired of this dull, old Boston, although a more precious&#xD;
home than ours , there is not in it22&#xD;
"You ought not to lQave it, as it is not necessary for you&#xD;
to do so~. home is the best place for a young girl."&#xD;
"Perhaps so! but I fear I shall consult my inclinations,&#xD;
rather than the sober judgment of those who would detain&#xD;
me."&#xD;

"You are very wilful, Miss Kate. I think young ladies&#xD;
who are less independent are more-" he did not finish the&#xD;
sentence; I thought he would here added lovable, and it&#xD;
stabbed me to the quick. I hastily ran up the front steps&#xD;
when we reached home, saying "good night:" then recall-&#xD;
ing his habit of coming in, when he met us accidentally, I&#xD;
asked him to do so, but he declined, saying h~ had business&#xD;
to occupy him for the evening. Frank Morton sat in the&#xD;
dining-room with Gertrude arid Josephine when III went in.&#xD;
I thought of Judith, and said,&#xD;
"Frank, have you heard from Mrs. Benzoni lately?"&#xD;
"Yes," he replied, "mother and I each got a letter by&#xD;
1'&#xD;
the last steamer.&#xD;
"By the I st steamer?" I inquired with emphasis.&#xD;
"By the I c~st, Miss Kate," he answered, turning over the&#xD;
leaves of his algebra, and coloring violently. It wounds his&#xD;
boyish pride to~ have his sister refe$rred.to, since her desertion.&#xD;
Miserable Benzoni! he did not remember that his wife's&#xD;
family and ours were on too friendly terms not to detect his&#xD;
falsehood. He hoped to beguile Grace away upon the strength&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
GllAPTEi~ XXI.&#xD;
Two silver lai~nps sh2d a softened radiance throughout the&#xD;
dressing-room of Madame Benzoni: they shone upon jewels&#xD;
lying upon the toilet table, rich jewels which had been taken&#xD;
from their casket by the abandoned wife. They were all&#xD;
gifts. from her husband, when they both dwelt in a world of&#xD;
love and bliss. Rarely had Judith worn them; sometimes&#xD;
when old memories swept over her overpoweringly, and she&#xD;
was startled to realize how hard and cold she had become, she&#xD;
would go to her jewels, and recall the exquisite beating of her&#xD;
h&amp;amp;trt, at the moment when they were giyen to her, with the&#xD;
lavish abandonment of idolatry. And if she were going to&#xD;
grace an evening company, she would sometimes don them&#xD;
with a pensive bitterness, as if they might still shed over her a&#xD;
halo of past joy. To-night she had taken them all out, and had&#xD;
gazed upon them, while a wild torrent of regret rushed over&#xD;
her. Oh! to recall the past! revenge slumbered, as it often&#xD;
did, and she only gasped forth despairing prayers for some-&#xD;
thing that might fill her being with the bliss for ever gone;&#xD;
her impatient heart beat in mad rebellion against the fate&#xD;
that tore from her grasp the sweets of innocent love. She&#xD;
was lonely, and no blessed spell had enwrapt her since that&#xD;
halcyon morning, which closed in deepest night. With a&#xD;
sick longing, she looked for the hour when her husband&#xD;

should come ~nd kneel at her feet, and shower upon her&#xD;
wilder, warmer love than ever, for his cruel suspicions. With&#xD;
flashings of pride, she oft dreamed she would reject him,-&#xD;
with gushing of overwhelming affection, she oft dreamed she&#xD;
wo4ld lay her head upon his breast, never more to wander,&#xD;
to defy. She stood thus, gazing tearfully upon her treasures,&#xD;
when an old man-servant tapped at her door, and presented&#xD;
her with a letter. She had lost track of her husband within&#xD;
a few months, and sometimes the thought occurred to her,&#xD;
that he might be near her, watching her in disguise. She&#xD;
had questioned the servant about his master's movements;&#xD;
she suspected that he communicated with him, but she could&#xD;
obtain no satisfaction. She looked ~t her letter; it was from&#xD;
her mother, not Benzoni. Sinking into an arm-chair, ~hu&#xD;
broke the seal; ~he had not read far, before she uttered,&#xD;
"Oh God! is not this too much!" and the dread agony&#xD;
of that awful time when first the bolts of fatb struck her,&#xD;
came to her again. She read on, but she learned nothing&#xD;
from the words: again, and again she strove to grasp all that&#xD;
the letter contained: at length she mastered it. 11cr head&#xD;
dropped wearily upon the arm of the chair; her heart was con-&#xD;
suming beneath fire and torture. The last stroke had fallen;&#xD;
but she threw back defiance, the pitiful defiance of despair,-&#xD;
she could now bear with derisive laugh any thing that ii~ight&#xD;
come,-she was vulnerable no longer to fresh blows. She&#xD;
dared not die, for Judith had read and thought much of&#xD;
immortality of late; she must live and breathe, although&#xD;
every breath was agony. The letter ran thus:&#xD;
"Mv DARLING CmLn,-I would give all the world if&#xD;
you were here with me; if I could spend all my time in try..&#xD;
ing to make you happy. I thank you so. much for your last&#xD;
letter. Your letters are more affectionate than they used to&#xD;
be. Never tbink for o~e moment, dearest Judith, that yo~&#xD;
&#xD;
did not study my happiness as much as you ought, when you&#xD;
were home. Whenever I read an affectionate expression in&#xD;
your letters, I 'am so foolish, I cannot keep from crying.&#xD;
Many a time have I heard my female friends say that they&#xD;
never appreciated their mothers until they went out into the&#xD;
darihjo' J&#xD;
world. Judith, ± udith, you have a mother whose&#xD;
heart will worship you until it ceases to beat; a mother who&#xD;
will go through fire a~d water for her child. Whenever you&#xD;
are sad, think of me; remember that I will always be faith-&#xD;
ful, that I would go with you to the darkest dungeon, to thie&#xD;
most dismal place on earth, if I could comfort and help you.&#xD;
I hardly dare tell the news; I fear it will break your heart.&#xD;
I have entreated your father to let inc visit you, that you&#xD;
may not be so forsaken. You are too proud to come~ back&#xD;
now, as matters have turned out. Well, my poor child, your&#xD;
husband is in Boston. Ho has not been here. I have had&#xD;
an awful time with Frank: he has not seen Mr. Beuzoni yet,&#xD;
although he has watched for him. lie carries a pistol in his&#xD;
pocket to shoot Beuzoni with; it almost distracts me; you&#xD;
know I am so afraid of firearms. Frank is as pale as death&#xD;
all the time, and so excited; I know he would kill that man&#xD;
as soou as snap his finger. I would not tell you that your&#xD;
husband is hero, if your father did not think it would be best.&#xD;
lie says you might take a notion to livd with him again, if he&#xD;
should come palavering around you, and he thinks he has&#xD;
treated you so shamefully, it would never do. He says I&#xD;
must tell you what Benzoni is about. He is trying to make&#xD;
love to Grace Percival again, or Ii imagine he is, for I have&#xD;
seen him call at the house. I can't tell how long he stayed,&#xD;
for the moment I saw him run up the front steps, Ii went to&#xD;
Frank and contrived to keep him busy for me a long time.&#xD;
You kndw Frank is a good boy, and ahnost always does any&#xD;
thing I want him to. I think as he grows older, he notices&#xD;
that your father is not always as kind and considerate towards&#xD;

me as he ought to be. Some boys would feel themselves&#xD;
privileged to abuse their mothers if they saw that their&#xD;
fathers did not treat them with as much tenderness and&#xD;
respect as they ought. Frank has tact: you know tact with&#xD;
a noble heart cane distil balm into' many a wound. Some-&#xD;
times when your father utters a contemptuous 'Pshaw!' at&#xD;
a remark of mine, Frank will color, and bite his lips to keep&#xD;
the tears away from his dear eyes. He has so often seen the&#xD;
tears in mine at such times-then after your father has, left&#xD;
the room, he will think of something that needs my judgment.&#xD;
I could kiss him a million times for his kindness, for the&#xD;
dear child knows that his judgment is better than mine any&#xD;
day. You see he does it to please me. lie spends a great&#xD;
many of his evenings with the Rodman children. I like to&#xD;
have him, for they have a good influence over him, and keep&#xD;
him from bad company. He said it was those children that&#xD;
broke him of the habit of speaking in a cross way. But I&#xD;
must stop talking of Frank: when I begin, it seen's as&#xD;
though I never could stop. My poor,, dear Judith, don't&#xD;
take what I have told you about Mr. Benzoni to heart. I&#xD;
know you can't help it in a measure, for you worshipped the&#xD;
ground he walked on. You must remember there is love in&#xD;
your own family for you; Frank has seemed to think more&#xD;
of you, since Benzoni left you, than he ever did before. He&#xD;
sends his love, also your father. You always have your&#xD;
mother's blessing, my darling. Kiss little Isadora ten thou-&#xD;
sand times for me. Oh! how I should like to see her. I&#xD;
shall be so glad when your answer comes to this.&#xD;
"Your devoted mother,&#xD;
"MARTHA MORTON."&#xD;
Slowly a side door opened unpractised feet came totaling&#xD;
in. Little Isadora reached her another's chair in triumph,&#xD;
and stood looking up in her face with ~hildish glee. She was&#xD;

THE MOTHER.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
a marvel of infantile beauty and grace. Judith looked at her,&#xD;
but with unmoved eyes: her cold, stony stare half terrified&#xD;
the child; the mirth left her large eyes; her smiling lips&#xD;
began to quiver. Judith passed her hand across her fore-&#xD;
head; she lifted up the little one with a murmured "my&#xD;
child," breathed in 'tones of tenderness.&#xD;
"My child! " she repeated, as lisa stroked her cheek, and&#xD;
looked with a scared pitying gaze into her face. Judith&#xD;
'burst into wild weeping; she sent up to heaven prayer,&#xD;
rather than mad defiance. She folded Ida to her heart, as&#xD;
if her innocence might yield a balm; and then, seeing a&#xD;
strange fear in the child's eyes, she kissed her once more, and&#xD;
took her into the other room, saying, "Marie, she must sleep&#xD;
with ni'e to-night." Poor Judith, even her heartless heart&#xD;
was womanly in its sorrow. Life had taught her that ~he&#xD;
could not brave the present or future, without a God, and&#xD;
without tender human affections. Her thoughts wandered.&#xD;
over the sea; wandered to the home that had cherished her.&#xD;
She looked within her mother's eyes, she heard her say,&#xD;
"Judith, I wish you loved me as some daughters love their&#xD;
mothers," and through her heart there welled a passionate&#xD;
remorse, a mighty sorrow that she had not chased away the&#xD;
meek reproach' with tender words. Little had she dreamed&#xD;
in her careless happiness, that the hour was roIling towards&#xD;
her, when her only hope would be, to weep and die on a&#xD;
mother's breast. She longed pitifully, with an insatiable&#xD;
yearning, to read in some human eye a tenderness that might&#xD;
sustain her, ere she drooped in death. What was flattering&#xD;
homage in an hour like this? What the smiling compliments&#xD;
of the gifted? She needed heart now, not brain; and no&#xD;
heart came to uphold her.&#xD;
Marie hastily entered. "Madame, the count and count-&#xD;
ess are waiting for you; and you are not di'essed."&#xD;
"I cannot go out' to-night, Marie: I am ill."&#xD;

Marie looked at her observantly~ and disappeared. In a&#xD;
moment, a light, tripping step approachedd the door; a tap&#xD;
sounded.&#xD;
"That heartless woman now!" broke from Judith's lips.&#xD;
Her unwelcome guest entered laughing, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"You must go; you shall go, my dear Madame Benzoni.&#xD;
But, heavens! you are pale as the dead. What is the mat-&#xD;
ter?"&#xD;
"A sudden rush, of blood to the heart or head, I think;&#xD;
I must not go out to-night," said Judith.&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense! You will get over it in a few moments.&#xD;
Let me call your maid to dress you; may Ii?"&#xD;
" Yes!" languidly responded the miserable woman, too&#xD;
weak to contend.&#xD;
"What beautiful jewels!" exclaimed Madame lianelli,&#xD;
as Judith approached the toilet table to lock them in their&#xD;
casket. "You are going to wear them?"&#xD;
Judith was robed in white; it was a simple dress, fasten-&#xD;
ing at the throat, and with long sleeves that concealed her&#xD;
beautiful arms. She wore no ornaments.&#xD;
"Pray, put something in your hair," entreated the count-&#xD;
ess; you look like a nun, or a martyred saint."&#xD;
Judith passively consented to wear a white japonica that&#xD;
bloomed in a pot onthe flower-stand. "I look no~v as if ]I&#xD;
were dressed for burial," she said; she strove to rally back&#xD;
her scattered vitality. They descended the broad marble&#xD;
stairs, and met the Count Ranelli in a reception room below.&#xD;
lie looked surprised, as his eye fell upon the white apparition&#xD;
of Judith. There was pity in his eyes,-and tenderness.&#xD;
Such a look had never met Judith before; tears rose invol-&#xD;
untarily, but she overcame them.&#xD;
"You are not well enough to go," said the count, very&#xD;
gently. "Has my wife over-persuaded you?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
213&#xD;
&#xD;
"ft will be better for her, count," returned his lady.&#xD;
lie handed them to the carriage without saying more.&#xD;
Madame iRanelli was a woman of violent temper, and indomi-&#xD;
table sclf2wihl; a charming acquaintance, and a most trying&#xD;
bosom companion. Judith had fallen in with her, and each&#xD;
had been' exceedingly pleased with the other. The intimacy&#xD;
that followed, had decreased Judith's partiality, but she felt&#xD;
that she could not afford to lose the friendship of so influen-&#xD;
tial a woman as Madame Ranelli. The curtain of private&#xD;
life was lifted to her view, and she saw CoMnt lianelhi, a man&#xD;
of many noble impulses, made completely miserable in his&#xD;
home; he was more fond of domesticity than the majority of&#xD;
his countrymen. Many a time had the deserted wife sat at&#xD;
their fireside, her heart brimming over with thoughts of one to&#xD;
whmoni she might have been a more thoughtful wife; she&#xD;
looked with wonder to see how idly Madame itanelli crushed&#xD;
beneath her feet blossomnings of peace and repose. Thought-&#xD;
fulness is often bought at the hour of retribution; bought&#xD;
too late.&#xD;
When Judith entered the soiree,, the blaze of lights, the&#xD;
hum of voices dizzied her brain. She sunk upon a seat as if&#xD;
in a dream, and answered vacantly the questions addressed&#xD;
to her. "Take me to the aim'," she whispered to Count&#xD;
IRanelli.&#xD;
They went out upon a portico, garlanded with vines, fra-&#xD;
grant with delicious blossoms. The cool moonhi~ht struck&#xD;
Judith's brow, and awoke her half-slumbering senses. Soft&#xD;
mnusic stole upon her ear; dreamy tones, harmonizing well&#xD;
with the shadowy landscape stretching beneath the moon.&#xD;
The court inquired in a low voice if she were better, and&#xD;
drew her shawl more closely about her. She trembled to&#xD;
hear that voice alone: the only voice out of the many speak-&#xD;
ing near her that night, which had an accent of sooth~mg&#xD;

consolation. lit said, "You are unhappy to-night, dear&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
She, was silent, but she turned to enter the house. Again&#xD;
the count spoke in 16w, tremulous tones, "IDo you fear to&#xD;
tell me how, sorrowful you are? I have sad hours also."/&#xD;
She was silent still, but her step was stayed.' Her heart&#xD;
was thrilling with a wild th~ught,-she could not turn from&#xD;
the voice of the charmer. Not in the flush of eager, happy&#xD;
life are female feet most apt to wander down the steeps of&#xD;
ruin; not while the heart is glad to number its exulting&#xD;
bounds, but when ii~ is poverty-stricken, and cries out for&#xD;
some anodyne that may lull it to rest or death. When the&#xD;
weary one has not where to lay her head,-when she has&#xD;
tasted the bitter waters of worldly friendship, and sees her-&#xD;
self alone in the universe, then is the winning voice of the&#xD;
tempter perilous.&#xD;
"Sweet friend, confide in me." The words broke on Ju-&#xD;
dith's ear so tenderly. She was forgetting the stern world,&#xD;
and sterner duty, and God. An arm gently encircled her&#xD;
waist, and a hand took hers. Then was the spell broken;&#xD;
then was Judith enfranchised. She had not yet gone down&#xD;
the first steps: she was startled. Her little foot gave a&#xD;
proud, impatient stamp, and she flung aside the count's hand&#xD;
with the air of an empress. , She was haughty Judith once&#xD;
more: the rich blood rushed to her cheek~; the glorious&#xD;
brilliance returned to her ey6s. She was prepared now to&#xD;
become the queen of the evening, and she was; but the&#xD;
smiles that washed over her lip were scornful; disdaining the&#xD;
captives whom her beauty enslaved.&#xD;
Lightly fell her footsteps as they entered the sacred pre-&#xD;
cincts of he~ bed-chamber; upon her pillow slumbered her&#xD;
skinless one. The air of the room see med holy after the dis-&#xD;
sipation of the night: its quiet wrought no soothing, spell&#xD;
however; accusing angels haunted it, and doubt and fear and&#xD;

helpless woe crept into Judith's heart. Her last hope had&#xD;
broken that day she was objectless,-undone. lie loved&#xD;
her then no longer; he turned to her whom she hactwronged.&#xD;
Oh, heavy retribution! oh, miserable agony!&#xD;
She unrobed herself:, and stole beside her child; she laid&#xD;
Isa's dimpled hand upon her brow, and dared to pray, "God&#xD;
be pitiful." She shuddered at the prayer; "God be just."&#xD;
She slept, and while she dreamed, the guardian angels who&#xD;
hovered about the child, murmured over her, "Even to this&#xD;
heart suffering comes as a regenerator. Behold! she&#xD;
prayeth!"&#xD;

CIJAPTEII XXII.&#xD;
&#xD;
A NEW home! and all seemed like the fairy changes of a&#xD;
dream. The parting on board the ship; the tears and smiles;&#xD;
the "write often;" the " God bless you ;" the "good-bye."-&#xD;
The ocean's boundless extent! the fresh current of a glorious&#xD;
exhilarating life; the extinguishing sea~sickness.. lit had all&#xD;
swept by. A light \airy villa crowns a sloping hill; a silver&#xD;
flashing river rolls below, and boats rowed by slaves holding&#xD;
gay young men hasten by. Afar, an even line of clouds&#xD;
betrays the near proximity of the sea. And within the airy&#xD;
villa sits Kate. Yes! I sat within my snug little chamber,&#xD;
which opened from the school-room. Both were covered with&#xD;
straw matting. I could make it look as cosy as a carpet. My&#xD;
chamber window overlooked the river, and the distant woods:&#xD;
I sometimes stepped out upon a light balcony from the window,&#xD;
and looked off upon the unknown country around, as I gazed&#xD;
into the unknown future with a desire to explore it. I h4d&#xD;
three pupils, Jessie, Ellen, and Fred, a young fellow of fo~ir&#xD;
years. Ellen declared that she would sleep with me, the&#xD;
moment I arrived. She was a little wiry, black-eyed girl of&#xD;
six. The children aJl slept in the room with Aunt Lucy, a&#xD;
fat, good-natured colored woman, with a red and yellow tur-&#xD;
ban. I was determined that my chamber should be as sacred&#xD;
a retreat as possible. I pinned up two or three pictures in&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE TEACHER.                217&#xD;
&#xD;
home-ni~ade frames, and every morning culled a glass of&#xD;
flowers, to beautify my little home. The rest of the house&#xD;
was not home to me yet. Bess, the chambermaid, came in&#xD;
the morning after li arrived, to make my bed and "tidy" my&#xD;
room. Ii told her I would take care of my OWII room; she&#xD;
need only bring up fresh water every morning. She rolled&#xD;
her eyes a little, and said "Yes, Miss." I heard her expa-&#xD;
tiating to Aunt Lucy afterwards about my being no great&#xD;
thing, " didn't know enough to be waited on." I didn't like&#xD;
tfie idea of being looked down upon by Bess, and perceived&#xD;
that I should be obliged to be very dignified and decided in&#xD;
my deportment towards her until she became convinced that&#xD;
I was somebody. The children were perfectly ungovernable.&#xD;
i[ tried winning looks and tones, and resorted to the utmost&#xD;
serenity of expression. But Fred "ha, ha'd," and vacated&#xD;
the school-room in the midst of my imperative gesticulating.&#xD;
When the family had acquired some confidence in me, Ii an-&#xD;
ticipated taking the self-will out of those three children with&#xD;
considerable unction. Jessie was an ill-mannered girl of&#xD;
eleven: she was not so well informed as a child of six should&#xD;
have been. The evening I arrived, the family were seated&#xD;
af the tea table: the servants ushered me into the room.&#xD;
They were expecting me. Mrs. Henry rose and took my&#xD;
hand kindly, inquiring if I were not fatigued. She bade a&#xD;
servant to take my bonnet and shawl, told Jessie to take me&#xD;
into her own bedroom close at hand'tu wabh, and then showed&#xD;
me my seat at the table. She was a delicate, pretty woman&#xD;
of thirty~ with soft blue eyes, and gentle manners. Her&#xD;
husband was not present. Miss Baldwin, a m~naiden sister of&#xD;
fifty, a stern, intelligent-looking woman, finished her supper,&#xD;
and watched inc while I was taking mine.&#xD;
7' You're the teacher?" said Fred.&#xD;
"Hush, Frederick," said Miss Baldwin; "little boys&#xD;
should be seen,~ not heard."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Say, are you the teacher?" he repeated, jerking my&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
I answered in the affirmative; his mother said, "Don't,&#xD;
Freddie dear!"&#xD;
"Were you placed under the captain's care, Miss 1-Tamil-&#xD;
ton ?" inquired Miss Baldwin with an inquisitor-like air, that&#xD;
assured me that Ii should soon be sifted thoroughly.&#xD;
Yes, ma'an~, I was," I returned, looking at her, and&#xD;
thinking, "I hope you will prove a friend."&#xD;
"Have you parents, Miss Hamilton?"&#xD;
"My parents died when I was a child."&#xD;
"Did you ever teach before?"&#xD;
"No, ma'am~ ~&#xD;
"Hew did you happen to think of coming South?"&#xD;
"I have always wanted to teach at the South since&#xD;
I have been old enough to think about getting my living.&#xD;
I used to have very romantic ideas of Southern life and&#xD;
chivalry. "&#xD;
"Y9u did, hey?" and she smiled cordially.&#xD;
"Get off this chair!" said Fred, giving me a brush with&#xD;
his little arm.&#xD;
"Fi~eddie, Freddie," said his mother, "don't disturb lie&#xD;
lady." I tell iou vociferated Fred, as i[ looked at&#xD;
"Get up,&#xD;
him with as much serenity as 'I could. "Why don't ou&#xD;
get up?"&#xD;
"Your mother would rather I should sit still," I&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
"No, you shan't !" and he employed both hands in strik ng&#xD;
me. His little mother took him, and by dint of great exer-&#xD;
tion, succeeded in dragging him out of the room, and consign-&#xD;
ing him to Aunt Lucy.&#xD;
"Minnie," said her sister, "that boy needs a sound&#xD;
thrashing. What's the use of your dcarin~ him, when he is&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
as ugly as sin? I don't like to see children abused, but I&#xD;
like to have them know the round world was made for some&#xD;
one besides them."&#xD;
Minnie said nothing, but looked pained.&#xD;
The next morning, I gathered my little flock around me,&#xD;
and examined their requirements. Jessie read execrably,&#xD;
Ellen worse. "I've read enough; I don't want to read any&#xD;
more!" said Jessie.&#xD;
"Head this next verse," I said, trembling lest she would&#xD;
not obey me. She condescended to read it, after saying,&#xD;
"Oh pshaw! what's the use?"&#xD;
Ellen had a fancy to be very good and gracious: I did*&#xD;
nQt admire it entirely, as I could see that she wished me to&#xD;
contrast her deportment with that of the two others. But&#xD;
upon. the whole, I began to have a sort of intellectual attach-&#xD;
ment for the children ;-a desire to see them improve: they&#xD;
had not entered into my heart irresistibly. Fortunately one&#xD;
cannot teach very well, without becoming deeply attached to&#xD;
children; without loving to watch intimately the unfolding&#xD;
of their characters. I was not really sorry to have difficul-&#xD;
ties to contend with; they diverted my thoughts. It pleased&#xD;
me to reform outrageous children, rather than to deal with&#xD;
amiable little saints, characterless, and compliant upon all&#xD;
occasions. As the days wore on, I became unspeakably&#xD;
homesick. Mrs. Henry was very kind, but she watched mc&#xD;
with an unsleeping observance ;-she noticed every sentiments&#xD;
I expressed. One evening a number of gentlemen called in:&#xD;
I had been so lonely, that I enjoyed their conversation very&#xD;
much. One was witty in the extreme, and I laughed heartily,&#xD;
although I did not speak except when addressed. Since that&#xD;
evening, Mrs. Henry had been rather more distant in her&#xD;
manners to me. I could not understand it. Possibly she&#xD;
thought a governess had no right to be amused at aristocratic&#xD;
wit. Yet when ladies called, she seemed to try to draw me&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
into conversation, and showed herself gentle-hearted and&#xD;
well-bred. She asked me once at the tea-table if IL belonged&#xD;
to any church.&#xD;
"IL do!" IL answered&#xD;
"What church 2" demanded Miss Baldwin quickly.&#xD;
IL told her.&#xD;
"Do you believe in the Bible 'U' questioned Mrs. Henry.&#xD;
Certainly."&#xD;
"In a change of heart 'U'&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
"Do you try to be a Christian 'U' Mrs. Henry looked at&#xD;
me almost pleadingly.&#xD;
"IL do try!" IL answered.&#xD;
She left the room, and her sister' said, I' Minnie's last&#xD;
governess was an unprincipled person; she dreaded to get&#xD;
another, but Mr. Henry in ~isted upon it. I hope, Miss&#xD;
Thimilton, we shall be happi ~y disappointed in you!"&#xD;
"IL hope so! "IL said coloring, yet almost indignant at&#xD;
the fear they had betrayed,-the suspicion with which they&#xD;
had observed my actions.&#xD;
"In what respect was the last governess unprincipled?"&#xD;
I inquired.&#xD;
Miss Baldwin blushed in her turn, but answered shortly,&#xD;
"She did not instruct the children properly."&#xD;
"IL should think they had been somewhat neglected. Do&#xD;
you think Mrs. Henry would be willing that IL should govern&#xD;
them as I wish in the ~chool-room? IL should not strike&#xD;
them of co~iirse, or shut them up in the dark."&#xD;
"Yes! IL hope you will control them."&#xD;
At this moment carrb~ge wheels stopped in front of the&#xD;
house. Presently two gentlemen entered unceremoniously.&#xD;
The tallest was~ about forty-five, an exceedingly handsome~&#xD;
pleasant-looking man. Miss Baldwin bowed to him stiffly,&#xD;
merely condescending to utter,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your servant, Mr. Henry."&#xD;
"And yours, madani," responded Mr. Henry, bowing.&#xD;
He added, turning to the young man with him, "This is my&#xD;
son, IEgbert, Miss Baldwin."&#xD;
"How do you do, sir 'U' said Miss Baldwin, extending&#xD;
her hand. She introduced me. Egbert was a. youth of&#xD;
nineteen, with blue eyes, rather a flat nose, and a lisp.&#xD;
"Where is Minnie?" asked Mr. henry, with a slightly&#xD;
embarrassed air. She came in at the instant, an dgazedin&#xD;
surprise at him; the warm color rushing over her face, then&#xD;
receding. She stood rooted to the spot, deathly pale.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Minnie!" said her husband, kiss-&#xD;
ing her, and leading her from the room. IL heard the sound&#xD;
of passionate weeping issuing from her bedroom, and her&#xD;
voice, "Oh! would to God IL ~had died first!&#xD;
IL went~ to my room, and wondered what tragedy the heart&#xD;
of Mrs. Henry was familiar with. Mr. ITenry had been absent&#xD;
from home two months, and IL was sure his wife was not ex-&#xD;
pecting him.&#xD;
It was very stiff and unsocial at meals. The younger&#xD;
children did not sit down with us; as they had been in the&#xD;
habit of doing in their father's absence. Mr. Henry had a&#xD;
pleasant way of speaking to the servants. He addX'essed&#xD;
me kindly too. Mrs. Henry seemed um4iappy, but some-&#xD;
times her eyes rested furtively upon her husband, and a world&#xD;
of love and sorrow was in her look. Miss Baldwin was&#xD;
grim as a grenadier. Egbert asked me one morning if IL was&#xD;
not very fond of a half-blown rose. After he and his father&#xD;
had left the dining.room, Miss Baldwin exclaimed, with up-&#xD;
lifted hands,&#xD;
"Isn't he a fool!" and thereupon she broke into one of&#xD;
the heartiest laughs IL ever heard from her. "If he looks&#xD;
like his mother, Minnie," she said, "your predecessor must&#xD;
have been a beauty."&#xD;

222            TROUBUSOME ChILDREN.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't, Adelaide! '~ said Mrs. Henry. II went to my&#xD;
arduoi~is duties. Fred had been growing worse and worse&#xD;
every day, until on this morning he fairly culminated. T&#xD;
sat hearing Ellen's lessoi~-taking advantage of a time when&#xD;
Fred lay on the floor picking straws out of the matting.&#xD;
P~'esently he advanced behind my chair, and stuck them, in&#xD;
my hair. I said nothing until he scratched my neck with&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Stop, Freddie!" I exclaimed, turning around, "that&#xD;
hurts me."&#xD;
"Glad of it!" he retorted.&#xD;
"I shall punish you if you do so again," I said, look-&#xD;
ing directly in his eyes, for Ii had determined to conquer or&#xD;
die.&#xD;
"You wasn't!" he elegantly responded. Ii went on with&#xD;
Ellen's lesson. H~ gave me another scratch. I felt equal&#xD;
to turning the earth out of its orbit. I went to my room,&#xD;
tied two pocket handkerchiefs together, and returned. Fred&#xD;
was laughing, and looked at me defyingly. I took hold of&#xD;
him. '~ No, you don't!" he said, kicking and striking: he&#xD;
was an amazingly strong child. At the peril of life and&#xD;
limb,, I succeeded in tying him to the back of a little&#xD;
bench, and sat down overcome by caloric. Fred screamed&#xD;
about ten minutes, and then was suddenly silent: he had&#xD;
extricated huinself, and stood looking out of the window,&#xD;
when I turned to see what was the matter with him. I&#xD;
groaned inwardly, but felt quite anxious to persevere in&#xD;
gaining the victory.&#xD;
"Freddie," I said, "you cannot be untied until I untie&#xD;
you myself!" I had a more terrible battle with him than&#xD;
at first; he kicked, thrashed, and roared. I thought II had&#xD;
tied him more securely, but just caught his hands in time&#xD;
to prevent a second escape. i[ sat ~1own beside him, and&#xD;
&#xD;
placed his head in my lap, while I held both his hands,&#xD;
saying,&#xD;
"You cannot stir, Freddie, until you promise to be a&#xD;
good boy., ~? he yelled, and set up a succession of unearth-&#xD;
'.' II&#xD;
ly shrieks. I allowed him this satisfaction, me rely remark-&#xD;
ing, "It won't make any difference, if you scream all your&#xD;
life, Fred!"&#xD;
Mrs. Henry put her pale face in at the door. "What is&#xD;
the matter? " she asked.&#xD;
"I have told Freddie he cannot be untied, until he pro-&#xD;
mises to be good."&#xD;
"Oh! I thought perhaps he was hurt!" she said, closing&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"Mother! Mother!" roared the child. I held him two&#xD;
hours before he would give up. I was absolutely ready to&#xD;
faint from exhaustion, when I asked him the last time, "Will&#xD;
you try to be a better boy, Freddie?" His cries had died&#xD;
away into sobs.&#xD;
"Yes!" welcome sound!&#xD;
"Say, yes, mct'ctm, Freddie."&#xD;
lie hesitated a moment, then obeyed. ii untied the poor&#xD;
little fellow, fully able to sympathies in his worn, exhausted&#xD;
feelings. I washed ~is dirty face, and combed his curly&#xD;
Lair, ready to cry with pity over his cowed look, and obe-&#xD;
client motions. I loved him for the first time, and his fear-&#xD;
ful look went to my heart: the obedience of slavish fear is a&#xD;
1 itiful~ thing. I thought of a poor wretell I had seen&#xD;
dragged through the street once, between two constables.&#xD;
Even so m~ little pupil had given up to me.&#xD;
"Do you want to play on the lawn with your rabbit,&#xD;
Freddie, before dinner?" II asked.&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am!" he meekly answered, and went down&#xD;
stairs. Jessie and Ellen had looked on at first with awe-&#xD;

struck faces, then over Jessie's cheek the tears had slowly&#xD;
dropped. Ellen had softly wept too, but they had said noth-&#xD;
ing. -&#xD;
"Come here, girls!" I said, after Freddie's disappear-&#xD;
ance. They came, and I talked to them along time, in a&#xD;
very faint, heart-breaking way, until they understood my&#xD;
feelings and duties towards them. Ellen went away when&#xD;
I had finished talking; but Jessie laid her hand on my arm,&#xD;
and said, "I understand you, Miss Hamilton. I'll try hover&#xD;
to make you any trouble."&#xD;
'~ Will you kiss me, Jessie! " I said. She threw both&#xD;
arms around my neck with the eager clasp of a loving heart.&#xD;
When the afternoon lessons were over, I told the ehil4reu a&#xD;
long' story. Freddie listened with apparent interest, amid&#xD;
when ,I had finished, lie asked Jessie in a whisper, questions&#xD;
abOut the story. He dared not ask me. After tea Ellen&#xD;

to look at the sunset. She had seen' me look with delight&#xD;
upon a glorious sunset several times, and had ever since pre-&#xD;
tended to be enraptured whenever the sun went down~ 'We&#xD;
went out, and Mr. henry followed us, tossing up Freddie,&#xD;
and saying pleasant things to the children, who hung about&#xD;
him idolatrously. lie ha~ the happy faculty of scattering&#xD;
them the moment he tires of playing with them. Old Aunt&#xD;
Debbie, Bess's mother, was hobbling along painfully. Fred&#xD;
threw a paper wad at her: lie kept paper in his pocket for&#xD;
this purpose; and he had aimed more than one at inc since I&#xD;
had been in authority ovem~ him.&#xD;
'~ Poor Aunt Debbie! " said Ellen, "she has the rheunia-&#xD;
tism so she ca~n hardly walk."&#xD;
'~ Poor thing!" I echoed.&#xD;
" She is a poor, forlorn creature!" Mr. Heni'y said kind-&#xD;
ly. He thrctst his hand in his pocket, and threw her a silver&#xD;
dollar.&#xD;

CUTTING REMARKS.&#xD;

&#xD;
" Give that to me! " said Fred, scrabbliiig down the steps&#xD;
of the piazza. lie picked it up and pocketed it, before the&#xD;
rhemnatic old woman could stoop down. Mr. Henry stamped&#xD;
his foot, and said sternly, " Hand it to her, Fred! " The&#xD;
child looked up to see if he were in earnest, then reluctantly&#xD;
gave the money to Aunt Debbie.&#xD;
"Isn't it better the old woman should have it, Miss&#xD;
Hamilton?" Mr. Henry asked, with his handsome smile.&#xD;
"I think so," I returned; smiling the gratitude II felt&#xD;
for his kindness to the old creature. 1~Iiss Baldwin, who&#xD;
had been looking at us from the window, now came out, and&#xD;
said in a tone I did not like,&#xD;
"You will take cold out here; Miss Hamilton. Hadn't&#xD;
you better conie in with the children ?"&#xD;
"If you think we shall take cold, certainly," I an-&#xD;
swered, the angry color rising to my cheek. I betook myself&#xD;
to my own quarters, wishing Miss Baldwin would uot take&#xD;
it upon herself to be a spy upon me. She was a man-hater&#xD;
in general, and she hated Mr. henry in particular. She&#xD;
was always making cutting remarks about the degeneracy of&#xD;
mankind at tlr~ table. Mr. Henry colored a little some-&#xD;
times, but he was never betrayed into any expression of an-&#xD;
ger: he was uniformly kind and gentle. I could not but&#xD;
admire his conduct; every thing I saw in him made me like&#xD;
him better. He treated us wife with respect, and I never&#xD;
heard her express a wish which he did not gratify. Yet&#xD;
there was an evident coldness between them. I thought,&#xD;
when I looked at theni sometimes, that nothing but the in-&#xD;
terference of done like Miss Baldwin, could have divided two&#xD;
hearts' seemingly so full of genuine feeling and }5enevolence.&#xD;
I began to dislike that elderly lady; she did not seem willing&#xD;
1\'lr. Henry should tak~i a moment's, comfort. She seemed&#xD;
almost angry with me because I treated him politely, and&#xD;
answered his remarks at the table. I pitied him so niuch,&#xD;

226                  TIlE LECTURE.&#xD;
I could not help wishing he had a more congenial home.&#xD;
One evening when Eghert and I were alone in the dining-&#xD;
room a moment, he said in his smiling etiquette-book&#xD;
manner,&#xD;
"I would not have you understand, Miss Hamilton, that&#xD;
I am in the babit of making personal remarks; yet I must&#xD;
say that jt strikes me unpleasantly to see a person so devoid&#xD;
of polish~ as Miss Baldwin. My father's second marriage&#xD;
would have been fortunate if it had not been for her. She&#xD;
tries to make trouble, and oft en succeeds in creating jealousy&#xD;
in Mrs. Henry's mind in regard to my father." Mr. Henry&#xD;
came in, and I disappeared with more alacrity than usual.&#xD;
Miss Baldwin's espionage was explained-it had been inten-&#xD;
sified since the return of the lord of the manor. Could it&#xD;
be that she was making evil out of my careless acts? that&#xD;
~he thought I could not be trusted to speak alone with Mr.&#xD;
Henry ? I laughed the idea to scorn: it was so absurd!&#xD;
"Will you go to the lecture, Minnie, to-night?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Henry.&#xD;
"What is the subject ?-and who lectures?"&#xD;
"Geology is the subject, and young Mr. Bedell delivers&#xD;
the lecture," replied Mr. ilenry.&#xD;
"Bedell!" said I, looking up. in surprise. "Is his given&#xD;
name James, and is he a Northerner?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Henry, "he is a townsman of yours.&#xD;
iDo you know him?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes! he is an old friend. How I should like "-~1&#xD;
stopped.&#xD;
"Suppose we all go!" said Miss Baldwin. "I like that&#xD;
Mr. Bedell. He is one of the feW sensible young men, ~o&#xD;
rare to he found."&#xD;
Mr. Henry ordered out the carriage, and it soon bore us&#xD;
to the city. The hall was full when we entered, but the&#xD;
lecture had not begun. I trembled for James, lest his em-&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE WREN'S NEST.            227&#xD;
&#xD;
barrassment should be extreme. I felt sure he had not seen&#xD;
our party. He rose; his eye keen and calm, roved over his&#xD;
audience; he commenced delivering his lecture in a clear,&#xD;
collected manner: it was~ strong, sound, and often eloquent.&#xD;
II looked at him with re~rerence for the heroic will which had&#xD;
conquered his constitutional bashfulness,-which had given&#xD;
him strength~ to appear before men, shorn of the defects&#xD;
whi~h would have prevented an appreciation of his intellect&#xD;
and acquirements. He closed his lecture nobly; he looked&#xD;
more than handsomealmost inspired; his voice rolled forth&#xD;
richest music. Every gesture was appropriate. I could&#xD;
scarcely believe that erect form, that face glowing with ex~&#xD;
pression, that white forehead from which the hair was dashed,&#xD;
belonged to James Bedell, the veritable James, to whom I&#xD;
had been introduced three years before. My wonder did&#xD;
not decrea:sc, when I saw the courteous quietness of manner&#xD;
with which he received the congratulations of his friends.&#xD;
He came down the aisle where we still stood: he met my&#xD;
eager look: any old friend would have been dear in that&#xD;
strange land; 11 could not conceal my pride and pleasure&#xD;
altogether.&#xD;
"Kate! " he exclaimed, his face flushing with surprise,&#xD;
and I thought, joy. His cordial welcome was like good&#xD;
tidings. He had not heard that I lived at the South.&#xD;
"Where are you going? may II walk with you, or have&#xD;
you friends?" he asked. He had met Mr. Henry's family&#xD;
before, so that an introduction was unnecessary. Mr. Henry&#xD;
politely invited him to ride out to " The Wren's Nest," as his&#xD;
place was modestly called, and spend an hour. He looked&#xD;
at his watch, and declin~d. Then he shook hands with me:&#xD;
he gave me a look as if he would search my thoughts. It&#xD;
said, "What do you think of me now?" and in my heart I&#xD;
said, "Oh! if I could forget one who sways my spirit as the&#xD;
moon s~vays the ocean tides."&#xD;

228                 A GIDDY PIECE.&#xD;
"That Mr; Bedell is a very fine y4mng man," said Miss&#xD;
Baldwin, in quite a friendly tone next morning.&#xD;
"I am surprised you should think so," said Mr. Henry&#xD;
sarcastically, "wh~in you have no Proof t~hat he is immaculate."&#xD;
"I have a little discernment," ret~ rted Miss Baldwin.&#xD;
She was called out of th~ room; Mr. 1' enry said jestingly,&#xD;
"Do you think, Mi s Hamilton, my sister-in-law had&#xD;
sufficient discernment last evening to discover that there were&#xD;
infinite dejtlts in a look that was bestowed on you by that&#xD;
same fine young man?"&#xD;
"I don't know," If answered, with a. startled blush, and&#xD;
added, "if her imagination equals Mr. Henry's, she can&#xD;
probably discern any thing she wishes."&#xD;
Mr. Henry laughingly responded, "When the wedding&#xD;
day is fixed upon,' repose a brotherly trust in me, by naming&#xD;
it, will you ? "&#xD;
" Oh, yes!" 1 acquiesced with a glance and a smile. Mis~s&#xD;
Baldwin came in, in the midst of this jesting; her friendly&#xD;
manner was gone. A young girl, daughter of a neighbor,&#xD;
came in to spend the evening'~ she was scarcely civil to her.&#xD;
After she had gone, she exelalined impatiently, "Harriet&#xD;
Thorn's brains could be squeezed into a peanut shell."&#xD;
I was inclined to agree with her. She was a pretty&#xD;
creature, with a brilliant complexion and bright blue eyes;&#xD;
there was a certain' hardness in them which I did not like&#xD;
however: her voice was rather loud and shrill, but h&amp;amp;r fri-&#xD;
volous, frequent laugh wrote out her character in itself, as it&#xD;
rang boisterously through~ the room. She took a desperate&#xD;
fancy to me; when she went away, she whirled me out into&#xD;
the hall with her, and vow~d she doted on me: the next&#xD;
minute she " tra la la'd," and asked Mr. Henry if he was&#xD;
not glad to escort such a "giddy piece" home. "Oh) dear!&#xD;
she exclaimed, "I wish we had more neighbors, so that III&#xD;
could go out every evening. ~Gomne ~n, Mr. Hen~y! you'll&#xD;

&#xD;
have to trip it pretty fast if you expect to keep up with me."&#xD;
She waltzed down the broad stone walk with a "tra la la!"&#xD;
"That idiotic girl!" Miss Baldwin vehemently uttered,&#xD;
as her shrill laugh penetrated through the closed windows&#xD;
and doors.&#xD;
"She is too lively," said Egbert, "but more brilliant&#xD;
than idiotic, Miss Baldwin."&#xD;
"Why didn't you go home with her instead of your father'&#xD;
sir?" demanded Miss Baldwin.&#xD;
"Some one, I will not say to whom the duty belonged,&#xD;
but some one neglected to introduce me."&#xD;
"Thdeed! that is thereason we were denied the edification&#xD;
of listening to any remarks from you."&#xD;
"It certainly was," said Egbert, with grave reproach.&#xD;
He retired to his room with his usual," Good-evening, ladies."&#xD;
"Sister," said Mrs. Henry, "I ~4sh you would not&#xD;
speak so to that poor fellow ;, he has never done us any harm;&#xD;
lie has his follies, b~xt he seems kindhearted, and I would&#xD;
rather retain his good will."&#xD;
F' Well, Minnie, I can't help it. Nature did not bestow&#xD;
on me your gentle disposition; I'll try, ~&#xD;
"Nature gave you a noble heart, Adelaide. You~ pre-&#xD;
judices make you unjust."&#xD;
"I suppose they do," sighed Adelaide. She is utterly&#xD;
devoted to Mrs. Henry. lEvery thing where she can have&#xD;
control, must yield to her sister's wish or comfort. I loved&#xD;
sometimes to sit and hear her talk, when she was in good&#xD;
spirits, and I liked to hear her hearty laugh. Sometimes she&#xD;
would come in the school-room after lessons were over, and&#xD;
chat an hour or two,-then would spring up in my heart a&#xD;
liking for her; she was well read, and ~ preferred the same&#xD;
authors. She often looked at me so kindly from her hazel&#xD;
eyes, and seemed to feel a positive interest in me: again, a cold&#xD;
suspicion marked her manner, when Ii was not conscious of&#xD;

having done wrong. She kept me liking and disliking her&#xD;
all, the time. One afternoon she sat in tbe school-room; one&#xD;
of Jessie's books fell behind her desk: she drew out with it,&#xD;
a ~mall Bible, and exclaimed, "0l~! here is Miss Hartly's&#xD;
little Bible after all. She looked and I9oked for it, and cried&#xD;
and looked! Shall we send it to her, Aunt Addie?"&#xD;
"Give it to me," said Aunt Addie sternly, "and go&#xD;
down stairs this instant! "&#xD;
J~ssie went pouting from the room, mumbling to herself,&#xD;
"Nee~ln't be so cross about it." Miss Baldwin soon followed&#xD;
her, ~ I sat down to write a letter. Jessie came in, and&#xD;
asked,!&#xD;
"What did she do- with it?"&#xD;
"With what?"&#xD;
d~XXTith her Bible? she won't let any of us mention her&#xD;
name."&#xD;
I wondered at this, mystery, but only answered, "She&#xD;
took it with her."&#xD;
".1 don't intend to mention her name, but she was always&#xD;
good to us, she never could make us mind though."&#xD;
"Well, Jessie, if your aunt don't want you to talk about&#xD;
her, you ought not to do it." I made this remark from&#xD;
principle, not inclination, for I was very curious to learn the&#xD;
history of one who hal occupied my own position in the&#xD;
family~ Jessie disappeared, and came back: she placed in&#xD;
my hand a daguerreotype. I opened it, saying, "Whose is&#xD;
it?" But Jessie kept her lips shut very tight. It was a&#xD;
lovely face, surrounded with careless, natural ringlets: the&#xD;
sweet flexible lips seemed as if repressing a happy smile,.-&#xD;
the countenance was childlike and tender, not self-relying or&#xD;
spirited. That fair, low brow upon which the hair waved so&#xD;
softly, could not have seen more than seventeen summers.&#xD;
I could not bear to give up the picture, but Jessie seemed&#xD;
anxious to get it into her possession again. She whispered,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Aunt Adclie don't know I have it. She, you guess who,&#xD;
don't you? well, she gave it to me long before she went ,away.&#xD;
Aunt Addie thought I gave it back to her, you know who&#xD;
I did put it in her hand, but I took it back again, and hid ~tk.&#xD;
Oh! how she did cry, when she kissed us children good-bye..&#xD;
We all cried: but don't tell I told you!"&#xD;
"IRun down stairs now, I must write,'~ I said, but Ii did&#xD;
not write. I thought of that sweet face. Ii had not much&#xD;
time to think quietly, however, for Ellen sooh burst into the&#xD;
rooni, clapping her hands and exclaiming in a high key, " Oh!&#xD;
Miss liamilton, mother says Jep may take us rowing on the&#xD;
river, if you would like to go with us. Jep is down there,&#xD;
cleaning out the boat now."&#xD;
"The ground is wet from the shower, Nellie, and it is&#xD;
quite a little walk by the road."&#xD;
"But we can take a short cut through the garden. We&#xD;
can pass through Mr. Thorn's side gate. Ah! Miss Hamilton,&#xD;
now don't say no."&#xD;
"Well," I answered, overcome~ by Nellie's deep' blue,&#xD;
imploring eyes, " we'll go !&#xD;
We met Mr. Henry on our way to the river side. The&#xD;
children besought him to accompany us, and he did so. Jep,&#xD;
a woolly-headed boy qf forty, had scrubbed the boat very&#xD;
nicely, and covered the seats with bits of carpet. Mr. Henry,&#xD;
with an attentive eye to our comfort, sent him back for buffalo&#xD;
robes, and we were soon -floating up the river, amid quiet,&#xD;
almost primeval scenery. Jessie and I took lessons in row-&#xD;
ing; ft was a long time before we did any thing but turn the&#xD;
skiff round and round, amid the laughter and shouts of the&#xD;
passengers. Mr. Henry was full of gay, genial humor. I&#xD;
could not help wishing there was as much good feeling in the&#xD;
whole family as in our part of it. We all seemed to feel that&#xD;
we had escaped from cold, prying eyes. It was an absolute&#xD;
delight to laugh at Mr. Henry's jokes, and not to be brought&#xD;

suddenly to terra firma by Miss Baldwin's voice or look.&#xD;
Freddie was comical beyond. belief. We reached home in&#xD;
high good humor.&#xD;
"See there, Miss Hamilton!" said Nellie, pointing to a&#xD;
black and blue spot, where I had pinched my hand in opening&#xD;
Mr. Thorn's gate.&#xD;
"Shocking ! isn't it, Nellie ?" I said, looking at the&#xD;
wound.&#xD;
The next morning I met Mr. Henry in the hail, lie&#xD;
laughed and said, "I have provided against your being hurt&#xD;
again with thaI~ gate. I sent a boy to put a new look on&#xD;
"Oh, you are very thoughtful. I am obliged to you,"&#xD;
I answered. I met Mi's. Henry at the instant coming down&#xD;
stairs; she had heard the few words that had been spoken.&#xD;
I could not bear to seo such a reproving look in her sweet&#xD;
face; I reflected on the occasion she had for giving me that&#xD;
look, and could see no cause for it. Her husband was al-&#xD;
ways respectful; indeed, no one ever treated me with more&#xD;
respect; lie was never coarse or ungentlemanly; every sen-&#xD;
timent he expressed was refined. This persecution of him&#xD;
distressed me~ At the top of the stairs I met Miss Bald-&#xD;
win; she had not opened her lips to me since the boat ride,&#xD;
and she passed me silently. She often seemed gloomy and&#xD;
unhappy; I passed her' without looking at her, then on the&#xD;
impulse of the mo~nent exclaimed,&#xD;
"Miss Baldwin, will you come to my room a moment?"&#xD;
She looked at in e in surprise, but instantly turned about&#xD;
and follow me. We entered my little chamber; she took&#xD;
a chair, and I sat on the bed. I spoke instantly, for I be-&#xD;
gan to grow embarrassed. "Miss Baldwin, if it is possible,&#xD;
I hope you will tell me why you seem offended with me. I&#xD;
want to do right, and I know I deserve no cold suspicions.&#xD;
Your manner implies them." Mere, according to a detesta-&#xD;
&#xD;
ble habit, I began to cry, at the very moment when I wished&#xD;
to be dignified, and to insist upon my rights. Miss Bald-&#xD;
win sat entirely siknt, until I had dried my tears. They&#xD;
had washed away all embarrassment and timidity.&#xD;
"Isn't it better tl~at we should understand each other?"&#xD;
I asked. "I would 1rath6r you would be frank enough to&#xD;
tell me wherein I have displeased you. I have entered the&#xD;
family as a stranger, prepared to be on good terms with all.&#xD;
II cannot consent to fail in politeness to one half, for the&#xD;
sake of pleasing the other. I cannot take sides in a family&#xD;
misunderstanding. I simply desire to be a devoted friend&#xD;
and teacher to the children. If the eld6r members of the&#xD;
family do not trust me, I shall leave, and very soon.&#xD;
"Miss Hamilton," and Miss Baldwin fixed a piercing&#xD;
look upon me, "you speak very candidly. I like you for it,&#xD;
but I should be better pleased to have you explain why you&#xD;
receive Mr. Henry's notice and attentions with so much&#xD;
pleasure and encouragement."&#xD;
The blood mounted like fire to my forehead: I could&#xD;
not restrain a scornful curve of the lip, as I said, "You&#xD;
have heard the French proverb, "Honi soit qui mal ypeflse."&#xD;
I walked to the window, then went back to my seat, saying,&#xD;
"iii wish you would point out every impropriety in my man-&#xD;
ner to Mr. henry. I am not conscious of any."&#xD;
She still kept her eyes upon me. "You will speak per-&#xD;
fect truth'?" she said.&#xD;
"I will,' I answered.&#xD;
"In your secret heart have you not thought Mr. Henry&#xD;
admired you?"&#xD;
I hesitated a moment, then said, "I never thought of it&#xD;
definitely. I think now that he probably does in a meas-&#xD;
ure; not as much, though, as I admire him."&#xD;
Miss Baldwin oppressedd her lips. "You do not fear&#xD;
to say that you admire him?"&#xD;

"Certainly not. As soon as I saw him, I thought he&#xD;
would seem like a father to me, when I became acquainted&#xD;
with him. You see I forgot at the moment that likes and&#xD;
dislikes were not suitable between employer and employed."&#xD;
"A father!" Miss Baldwin contemptuously uttered.&#xD;
"Miss Hamilton, don't affect so much innocence. "'&#xD;
"Thank God, I have seen too little vice in my lifetime,&#xD;
to recognize it readily," I answered, as my heart burned un-&#xD;
der her unmerited scorn. "It is easy for inc to understand&#xD;
that you have wronged Mr. Henry, if you can impute evil&#xD;
to me withso little cause. The whitest soul would look&#xD;
black through a darkened glass, and the most innocent ac-&#xD;
tions guilty. I do not doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Henry&#xD;
might be happy in each other's love at this moment, if cruel&#xD;
suspicions had not tortured their love to death."&#xD;
"I am not very suspicious by nature," Miss Baldwin re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
"You are a man-hater, and look for evil in them, as ~&#xD;
matter of course. ]i do not see that we can understand each&#xD;
other, after all. As I am not willing to be watched, and&#xD;
suspected of wrong motives every day, I will avoid it. Will&#xD;
you please tell Mrs. Tlcnry I have given up n~y charge'?"&#xD;
I had never been so intensely angry and wounded. I ex-&#xD;
peeVed Miss Baldwin would leave the room, but she sat still.&#xD;
I left the room myself to be rid of her presence. 'Without&#xD;
thinking where I went, I bent my steps to the garden, and&#xD;
strolled on to a grove of trees. I encountered 1~Ir. Henry.&#xD;
As I met his look I became conscious that tears were drop-&#xD;
ping fast over' my cheeks.&#xD;
"What is it?" he asked.&#xD;
"Nothing," I responded, provoked to have met him when&#xD;
I was so deeply excited.&#xD;
"Stop one moment," he said gently, yet authoritatively.&#xD;
"If your feelings have been hurt or rounded by any mciii-&#xD;
&#xD;
ber of my family, I have a right to know it. If any thing&#xD;
eLse has disturbed you, II am sorry. Who has been talking&#xD;
to you'? My sister-in-law?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am going away this very day."&#xD;
He looked greatly vexed. "I had loped, for my chiV-&#xD;
dren's sake, we might have retained a gooji. teacher. They&#xD;
have run wild always, because Adelaide Baldwin has con-&#xD;
stantly succeeded in making troublQ. I have learned to bear&#xD;
her taunts, knowing they are but the offspring of her suspi-&#xD;
cioiis brain. It is not easy for me to forgive that woman&#xD;
the unhappiness she has occasioned in my family. A man&#xD;
seeks rest and content within his home: ydu may have per-&#xD;
ceived that there is little sunshine there for me. I had&#xD;
hoped you might have taught my children to be a blessing&#xD;
to me. But I will not seek to detain you; you have the&#xD;
right to seek a more peaceful home." lie spoke very sadly.&#xD;
I reinenI~ered that Ii had hoped to do the children good;&#xD;
they were already improving fast. Why should I forsake&#xD;
my post, because of that jealous woman, who would proba-&#xD;
bly drive the next governess away in the same manner.&#xD;
"i[ will stay," I said.&#xD;
"Thank iou," Mr. Henry replied, with a glad look. I&#xD;
hurried from him, and went in the house. There sat Miss&#xD;
Baldwin, where I had left her.&#xD;
"Let us be friends," - I said, holding out my hand.&#xD;
"Won't you trust me?" My anger had vanished when I&#xD;
reflected how unhappy the poor creature made herself by&#xD;
such a disposition. She took my hand cordially, and looked&#xD;
right into my eyes. "I believe you are honest," she said.&#xD;
"I irust you. Oh! if you knew all that I know, you would&#xD;
not wonder that I suspectt every one. I have spoken un-&#xD;

had gone on pleasantly. I had most carefully avoided Mr.&#xD;
Henry, and both Mrs. Henry and her sister had been very&#xD;
kind and affectionate to me. It seemed sincere; yet Ii half&#xD;
feared that I was treading on~a volcano.&#xD;
A few weeks after I ~stepped within the library to look&#xD;
for Fred~iie. Mr. Henry sat there writing.&#xD;
Come here," he shid, looking up, and then resuming&#xD;
his writing. I went to the table, saying, "Do you want&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"You have taken great pains to avoid being tainted by&#xD;
me," he said~&#xD;
"I am not afraid of being tainted by you," I replied.&#xD;
"You ought to know that. But it is certainly best to keep&#xD;
peace in the family."&#xD;
"You have gone over to the other side. Miss Bald~vin&#xD;
has convinced you."&#xD;
"No, she has not. She says nothing about you now. I&#xD;
have never believed her insane prejudices."&#xD;
"honor bright! Shake Lands, then." I shook hands&#xD;
with him, and turned away, while the handsome smile yet&#xD;
lingered on his lip..&#xD;
"Ali! Miss Hamilton," he said, rising, just as I was go-&#xD;
ing out of the door, "Ii have a new history here, I have just&#xD;
been buying. I wish y~u would look at it, and see if Jessie&#xD;
is sufficiently advanced to study it." There was an eager-&#xD;
ness in his tone an expression in his eyes, that suddenly do-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TRUTUX.&#xD;
&#xD;
237&#xD;
&#xD;
stroyed the perfect freedom I[ had always felt with him. II&#xD;
became aware that he did not reverence me, as I had sap-&#xD;
posed from his manner always. My eye fell beneath his&#xD;
look, and the scarlet rose to my temples.&#xD;
"Some other time," I said, scarcely knowing how to act.&#xD;
"Look at it now, my child," he answered, and I knew&#xD;
that th~ look was not removed, and that the handsome smile&#xD;
accompanied it. A proud, disdainful anger leaped to my&#xD;
heart; I was poor-.dependent; therefore in his cruel selfish-&#xD;
ness, h~ never thought that my God was my protector. I&#xD;
closed ~he door, and. went up stairs. I thought if Ii had been&#xD;
in Mrs. Henry's place, II should have wept wild tears to have&#xD;
seen on~ a husband's face, thatlook and smile of interest for&#xD;
another~ The veil had fallen from my eyes; it was true,&#xD;
after al, that the unhappiness of the family was Mr. Henry's&#xD;
fault. Miss Baldwin hated him with justice, because he was&#xD;
killing her sister's peace; in truth he must be breaking that&#xD;
sweet wife's heart. He had not a holy love for her.&#xD;
School was over for the day; I took my sawing and went&#xD;
to the sitting-room.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" asked Miss Baldwin, who was&#xD;
alone. "Your face is flushed."&#xD;
"Every thing has changed to me within a brief half hour 1"&#xD;
I answered, sitting down by her. "I have always believed&#xD;
you were unjust to Mr. Henry; now I do not."&#xD;
"Alt!" she simply said, with a quick look of inquiry.&#xD;
"He has not sad any thing to me that was iot perfectly&#xD;
right it itself, but his inner nature flashed out in a look. i[&#xD;
realize now that he is unworthy of his tender, pure wife. I&#xD;
see that his handsome exterior and his graceful manner are&#xD;
untrue interpreters of himself: he does not seem to me any&#xD;
more a noble, persecuted man, and you do not now seem a&#xD;
merely suspicious woman, nor is Mrs. Henry a weak dupe.&#xD;
I see the truth now."&#xD;

NO FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Baldwin's hazel eyes looked upon me with the kind&#xD;
of fondness that they turned on her sister; this look gave me&#xD;
joy, for I could not forbear yearning after the love of a strong&#xD;
heart, a motherly and ye~t sisterly heart.&#xD;
"I should have told you," she said, "every particular of&#xD;
his detestable career, if Minnie had not besought me not to&#xD;
reveal his failings. She hopes he will do better all the time:&#xD;
she loves him still to idolatry. He often pets her when he&#xD;
cannot find any one else to attract his attention. These rare&#xD;
words of kindness keep her in constant torture; they prevent&#xD;
her from overcoming the last remnant of affection; if that&#xD;
was accomplished, she would grow calm, and he would lose&#xD;
the power of moving her :-it will come to this in the end, but&#xD;
oh! it is fearful before one reaches such calmness."&#xD;
"If she could love him as a sister loves an erring brother,&#xD;
without relying upon a pure affection from him, might she&#xD;
not be happier~ and do him some good?" I asked.&#xD;
"No," returned Miss Baldwin, in heir abrupt way; "your&#xD;
have never been married, and you know nothing about it.&#xD;
Now that you have discerned for yourself that Mr. Henry is&#xD;
less than divine, I suppose there is no harm in saying that&#xD;
he has done every thing for effect since you have been here;&#xD;
he always acts for effect when we have a new governess.. Do&#xD;
you wonder that Ii could not refrain from watching you; when&#xD;
I knew that Mr. Henry was one of the most artful, as well as&#xD;
the most fascinating of men? I, feared he would interest you&#xD;
long before you dreamed of it."&#xD;
"A married man?" I asked, as a glow of indignation rose&#xD;
in my heart. "You did not believe then that I was governed&#xD;
by principle, or that compassion for his wife could enter my&#xD;
being?"&#xD;
"I have very little faith in human nature; when you&#xD;
have lived as long as I have, you will find it difficult to be&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
MY LIFE WORK.                239&#xD;
trusting. You will loathe, abhor and detest men; they are&#xD;
so selfish, so unmerciful to women."&#xD;
"Is not Mr. Henry ordinarily kind to his wife?"&#xD;
He gives her any amount of money she asks for; he&#xD;
whisth~s when she upbraids him: this she very rarely does&#xD;
-sometimes he reasons with her, and tells her to seek her&#xD;
happiness wherever she can find it, and he will do the same.&#xD;
He knows she never would dishonor herself. He has not the&#xD;
least faith in woman's innate purity; he thinks every one&#xD;
has a price; it is this low, base appreciation of woman that&#xD;
makes me despise him so intensely: it is a revelation 'of his&#xD;
own true character."&#xD;
"What kind of a mother had he?"&#xD;
"She died in his infancy."&#xD;
~'Has he sisters ?"&#xD;
"No; he never had."&#xD;
"Poor Freddie his childhood needs to be circled about&#xD;
with holiness. I am truly glad that I understand Mr. Hen-&#xD;
ry. From this hour Ii will devote my soul to Freddie: I&#xD;
will teach him to distinguish right and wrong, and will strive&#xD;
to impress Jessie and Ellen with an idea that they are in a&#xD;
measure responsible for Freddie's future. Let us keep the&#xD;
children pure; let us make them gentle by their seeing the&#xD;
beauty of goodness in us. Won't you fervently join me in&#xD;
this work, Miss Baldwin?"&#xD;
She made me no reply, but a mist caine over her eyes,&#xD;
and I knew that she would help me. After our conversation,&#xD;
I turned my soul with a new vigor to my life-work; a fresh&#xD;
love sprang up for the children; very beautiful it seemed to&#xD;
watch all the souls around me; to believe they were almost&#xD;
unknowingly turning towards the grand accomplishment of,&#xD;
their destiny-a~ higher and better life.&#xD;
Mr. Bedell occasionally came to see me. One evening&#xD;

A LETTER FROM GRACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
he asked, "Do you know, Kate, the reputation Mr. Henry&#xD;
bears ?1~&#xD;
"I presume it is not a very good one,'? I returned.&#xD;
"I am aln~ost sorry you live here, dear Kate. Mr. Henry&#xD;
only draws about him dissolute men."&#xD;
"He never brings them h5e," I answered. "His wife&#xD;
is a very lovely woman. I am not sorry I live here, I am&#xD;
glad. He is in reality an alien here; the rest of us love&#xD;
each other."&#xD;
James drew a letter from his pock~t. "I inquired for&#xD;
you when I went to the post-office."&#xD;
"Why didn't you give it to me before?" I asked. He&#xD;
was just going away.&#xD;
"I feared you would not appreciate my company with&#xD;
that in your possession," he answered, laughing. "Good&#xD;
night."&#xD;
The letter was from Grace. I read.-&#xD;
"DEAK KATE,-I have written news and commonplaces&#xD;
in all my letters so far-now I will say a few words relative&#xD;
to myself-I will speak from my 'innermost,' whether you&#xD;
will or n&amp;amp;. I must speak, or I shall give way. I am so&#xD;
wretched! how can Ii bear it? how can 1 resign the joy that&#xD;
seemed almost my own? Oh, Kate! I never told you how&#xD;
I had learnqcl to love again; how deeply, oh! how unwisely,&#xD;
I fear. Yes, I can simply die-die slowly. I have not the&#xD;
same vitality to overcome, that I had once. I do not mur-&#xD;
mur; it is right, beloved Kate, all right-yes, I can submit&#xD;
myself to my irrevocable destiny now as I could not once,&#xD;
but I suffer nevertheless. My heart turns with most ago-&#xD;
nized yearning to the object of my love-I cannot tear it&#xD;
away from him-I cannot give him up; and yet, my Kate,&#xD;
he does not come to me, he turns upon me no longer the looks&#xD;
that drew my soul to him-the looks that robbed me of my-&#xD;

self and gave mc to him. Ii never can divorce my heart&#xD;
fr6m his, for he is pure and good-he is worthy, and more&#xD;
thaP worthy, of all my reverent homage; if he were not,&#xD;
then might I some time hope to be enfranchised. Dear&#xD;
Kate, I know that he sought and loved me once-il know it;&#xD;
oh! can it be so easy to break the spell with him? II have&#xD;
feared that he thinks II am not all he thought-perhaps I am&#xD;
not all he sought in a wife. Gan I have mistaken his feel-&#xD;
ings? This idea has rolled upon me with a fearful weight,&#xD;
pressing the breath out of my heart, as the car of Juggernaut&#xD;
crushes t1~e life out of those over whom it passes. Perchance&#xD;
he has heard the stories that Benzoni has circulated among&#xD;
his acquaintance. That miserable Benzoni! how did I ever&#xD;
love him? how invest him with a glory and kingliness that&#xD;
never crowned other mortals ? Surely it is but just that&#xD;
There should be another world to explain the deceptions of&#xD;
this; *a place where mortals cannot refrain from throwing off&#xD;
their masks. I have learned that Mr. Beuzoni has subtilely&#xD;
spread among his acquaintance a report, not only of Judith's&#xD;
death, but of my engagement to him. You know his friends&#xD;
are not ours, and the story may have reached the ears of one&#xD;
in whom I had placed perfect trust, because I hoped he knew&#xD;
me too well to doubt mc under any circumstances. It does&#xD;
not belong to me to free myself from unjust suspicions in his&#xD;
eyes: if he had declared his love,~ then the door would be&#xD;
open for an explanation. I see him in the presence of others;&#xD;
this cannot be avoided; but he does not come near me, or&#xD;
allow his eyes to fall on me. I have not seen Mr. Benzoni&#xD;
since we met in the summer-house; he has made many use-&#xD;
less attempts to speak with me. In fact, Kate, I have re-&#xD;
mained a prisoner at home through fear of meeting him. I&#xD;
encountered him once in the street: I was near Miss Cardo-&#xD;
ve+'s house. I hastened forward, and entered before he&#xD;
reached me. You cannot imagine how this undignified&#xD;

hEAVENLY DREAMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
pursuit on his part1 excites my contempt. Love, true, noble&#xD;
love, arises from a harmony of thought and feeling; it cannot&#xD;
be bought by exertion. It was strange how I loved him:&#xD;
very strange, when we wer~ so totally unlike; but I invested&#xD;
him with all the beautiful quality~ capable of winning my&#xD;
admiration, and so I worshipped my ideal under the belief&#xD;
that he was its actual.&#xD;
"Sometimes ~my soul melts into the tender dreams, the&#xD;
mellowed glories that might, and do rarely iri~adiate passages&#xD;
of human life, then I would drive away the grim and sorrow-&#xD;
ful that' is allotted to each one, and say with closed eyes,&#xD;
'Oh, give me these heavenly dreams!' But it is well; I&#xD;
would not, if I could, take my earthly fate from the hands&#xD;
of Providence-I desire to acquiesce. I know indeed that&#xD;
the night ~ometh, but upon its steps, the morning. Yet I&#xD;
sometimes grow very weary in keeping Pp my hope in this&#xD;
practical world-sometimes it seems as if life is only one long&#xD;
prayer for patience. I am trying to cast myself into a holier&#xD;
world of lovQ-tryiPg to look upon my fellows with eyes like&#xD;
to those that bend down on us from above.&#xD;
"Perhaps I shall have happier tidings to conYmunicate in&#xD;
my next. I hope so. Don't let this gloomy letter sadden&#xD;
you, because we both believe, dear Kate, that suffering its a&#xD;
winged angel to link our hearts to heaven. Therefore rejoice&#xD;
for me, although I am not now able to rejoice for mys~elf.&#xD;
Are you happy, dear, in your new home? Our hearthstone&#xD;
is surrounded by peaceful hearts. Dear John is growing&#xD;
quite gallant to Mary! It would do your heart good to hear&#xD;
her laugh sometimes. You know we used in old times to&#xD;
wish she 'would occasionally have a nonsensical mood as we&#xD;
did. She does sometimes now. She is growing youthful,&#xD;
and I am growing wise-I wont! say old. They all send a&#xD;
vast deal of love. Your loving&#xD;

POOR GRACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
24&#xD;
&#xD;
This letter brought back in a flood-tide the dream in&#xD;
which I had sometimes lived. The words of Grace's letter,&#xD;
"Can it be that I have mistaken his feelings?" thrilled me&#xD;
with the strangest hope-the, saddest fear: Oh , sometimes I&#xD;
ltctd thought that in Pliny's eyes and voice there dwelt an ex-&#xD;
pression and accent that did not belong to friendship m~ely.&#xD;
Poor Grace! how selfish was the joy with which I read those&#xD;
words; how self.reproachful the next thought. I hated my~&#xD;
self for that joy, but I could do nothing but turn away from&#xD;
the world of thoughts that rushed over me; there was a tor-&#xD;
rent on each side flowing in. A beautiful light, a glorious&#xD;
joy !-then, with the next thought, such an intense pity for&#xD;
Grace, such a feeling of humiliation over myself, that I could&#xD;
even transiently be happy in what caused her suffering~&#xD;
Wearied with this self-conflict, II took a book and strove to&#xD;
read, but Ii did not comprehend the words; then Ii read&#xD;
aloud, determined to scatter my thoughts; in this I succeed-&#xD;
ed, and a measure of quietness stole over me.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mus. HENRY was ill and low-spirited; she sent for me to sit&#xD;
with h~r as her sister had gone to the city. I went to her&#xD;
room, and saw her sitting wearily in her arm chaii; she&#xD;
looked at me with a kind of yearning, pitiful look, as if she&#xD;
wished she could be comforted. She held out her hand, and&#xD;
for the first time, drew me down and kissed rue.&#xD;
"Shall I sit on this little cricket at yonr feet?" I asked.&#xD;
"Yes, do so," slie~ returned.&#xD;
"And shall I tell you, you must not give way to dejec-&#xD;
tion when we all love ~you so much," I pursued, looking in her&#xD;
sweet eyes.&#xD;
"Do you?&#xD;
"Yes, indeed; so don't look on the dark side."&#xD;
"There is no bright side for me, Miss Hamilton." Then,&#xD;
as if she feared she had betrayed her secret sorrow, she added,&#xD;
"You know if one's health is wretched, nothing else can com-&#xD;
pensate for the loss."&#xD;
"No, certainly not."&#xD;
I half thought the poor wife's heart ached to pour out its&#xD;
anguish to me, but she was' silent. "Let me read to you,~~ I&#xD;
said; "where is 'Yeast?' its dark pictures will make our&#xD;
home seem brighter. What should we do if we could not&#xD;
find fresh life in books? Shall I read ?" Minnie consented,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BATTLE PRUDE.             245&#xD;
&#xD;
and I went into the sitting-room to look for the book-I left&#xD;
the door partly open; there was a door leading into Mrs.&#xD;
He~ry's room from the hail. At that door I heard her hus-&#xD;
band's voice, saying, as h~ opened it,&#xD;
C ood evening, Madam! "in a hard, cold tone, that must&#xD;
have fallen upon his wife's weary heart like a knife-stroke.&#xD;
"0, Philip," she answered, with mingled entreaty and&#xD;
timidity, "can you leave me now?"&#xD;
He whistled and closed the door. I supposed he had en-&#xD;
tered the room with his wife, and ]I hastened into the hall to&#xD;
go up stairs that I might not hear their conversation. I met&#xD;
him almost face to face, as he came forward towards the front&#xD;
door. A smile came instantly to his lips, the old, handsome,&#xD;
fascinating smile; but oh! how it had changed to me. I&#xD;
felt sure that he did not suspect I had heard his cold words&#xD;
to poor Minnie. He extended both hands, and said in a&#xD;
frank, kindly way, (or such it would once have seemed,)&#xD;
"Will you bid me good-bye, little lady ?"&#xD;
"Good bye!" I said, passing by him, without appearing&#xD;
to notice his outstretched hands. I heard him utter, " con-&#xD;
founded little prude!"&#xD;
"Miss Hamilton! ~' he called, as I was ascending the stairs,&#xD;
"I think I heard you speak of a French work you would&#xD;
like to read, the other day."&#xD;
"Well!"&#xD;
"I can Qbtain it for you at Baltimore."&#xD;
"Thank you! it is too expensive for me to buy!"&#xD;
"I should be happy to present it to you, if you will allow&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"No," I said, shaking my head.&#xD;
"Why? you would not refuse it from any one else!"&#xD;
"I would rather not be under obligations to Mr. Henry !"&#xD;
IF answered, coloring. A black cloud of anger lowered over&#xD;
his face: he bowed, with a bitter smile. I hastcr~ed up stairs,&#xD;

Lind saw him enter ~he carriage which stood at the do6r. Jep&#xD;
was arranging sometlPng about the horses in his usual slow&#xD;
way before getting in. Mr. henry caught the whiji, and' gave&#xD;
him a blow across his face, Which made him spring from his&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
Get in, you villain, and drive like the devil! " he com-&#xD;
manded.&#xD;
"Jep obeyed, but I saw a streak of blood where the pas-&#xD;
sionate blow had fallen. Ii went down to Mrs. Henry. Still her&#xD;
pale face lay back against the chair; tears ~Vere slowly&#xD;
trickling over it. She was of a childlike nature, and I dared&#xD;
caress her, forgetting that I was not the elder. After very&#xD;
wise advice, I wiped away her tears, and read to her. When&#xD;
Miss Baldwin returned with ~ r. Bedell, whom she had' met in&#xD;
her pedestrianizing in the cit , Minnie had smiles for her.&#xD;
Jessie took tea in her      room: we caught the sound&#xD;
of their chat, as we sat at ou~ own tea-table in the dining-&#xD;
room. Miss Baldwin was in excellent spirits, and so was&#xD;
James. The latter deemed so good, and pure and noble;&#xD;
so interesting, compared with the few gentlemen I met. ill&#xD;
enjoyed his visits so heartily, and looked forward to them as&#xD;
the brightest event of the week. I called him "brother,"&#xD;
and sometimes he said "sister," but when he did, he looked&#xD;
into my eyes inquiringly, arid smiled.&#xD;
We sat sewing, Miss Baldwin and I, in the school-room&#xD;
one afternoon. "Are' you 'engaged to Mr. Bedell, Miss&#xD;
Hamilton?" she asked quietly.&#xD;
"No! he is only a sort of adopted brother!"&#xD;
"You expect to be engaged to him some time or other?"&#xD;
she pursued.&#xD;
" 0. no! never!&#xD;
"Are you in earnest?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am."&#xD;
"Then you are a dunce!"&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ii reckon not!" IL answered, laughing. "Mr. Bedell&#xD;
knows my sentiments, and visits here as a friend or relative&#xD;
would."&#xD;
"You are mistaken. I suppose you will be foolish enough&#xD;
to trust your happiness to a man's keeping some day; you&#xD;
will never find a better than Mr. Bedell. IL speak to you as&#xD;
a sincere friend. If IL were wholly selfish, II should advise&#xD;
you nqver to change your present home."&#xD;
"Mr. Bedell will never ~he more to me than he is now!"&#xD;
"Then you are not acting towards him as you ought.&#xD;
You encourage him! "&#xD;
." But he is a very dear friend. I could not bear to have&#xD;
him stop coming here."&#xD;
"You ought to make up~your mind not to flirt!"&#xD;
"I have not intended to. I have thought of this matter,&#xD;
and imagined I was very conscientious."&#xD;
"Humph 1" said Miss Baldwin as she rose, and went&#xD;
away. I laid my face down on the desk before me, and cried&#xD;
with my whole heart. Miss flaldwin wa~ right. I knew&#xD;
that James loved me. But how to give up his friendship,'&#xD;
lonely as II was? There was a rap at the school-room door.&#xD;
I started to my feet. James himself entered.&#xD;
"I thought you said, come in!" he exclaimed, surprised&#xD;
at the plight in which he found me. " Iromesick?"&#xD;
"Yes and not to be seen!" I answered, throwing my&#xD;
~pron over my face. "Please excuse me, unless you have&#xD;
business to speak about."&#xD;
"You can't hear with your face covered."&#xD;
'' Then delay your message.~~&#xD;
"Will you visit some paintings with me to-morrow eve~&#xD;
ning."&#xD;
"It cannot to-morrow evening!"&#xD;
"II shall not be able to go again in a week."&#xD;

" You call me brother, dear Kate; why not allow me to&#xD;

He understood' me, and grew pale, while his eyes rested&#xD;
on me.. ",Forgive me!  I said, as I saw the paiu struggling&#xD;
in his heart.&#xD;
" Am I as dear to you as a brother ?" he asked in an&#xD;

" Yes !"&#xD;
" Not dearer, Kate ?"&#xD;
" No ! good-bye ! Don't speak again," I uttered with&#xD;

"Kate, this is not a /'good-bye.' It must not, cannot&#xD;

apparently heeded not its helplessness, its sunshine, or its&#xD;
anguish. I felt for James the same intense pity with which I&#xD;
regarded myself.&#xD;
"Kate, am I cast off?" be repeated.&#xD;
"Yes !" I rose as I said it.&#xD;
He started back, and turned to leave the room; but&#xD;
again he came to my side, and said with gentle firmness, " I&#xD;
will not take your answer now. Think about it. It is des-&#xD;
tiny !-it will be. I will come again in a week. Good-bye&#xD;
until then ! " he pressed my hand, and touched his lips to my&#xD;
forehead, and his earnest eyes dwelt on mine until 'the door&#xD;
closed. It seemed to me at that moment, that it was destiny,&#xD;
and I stood dreamily on tihe spot where he had left me, my&#xD;
tears stayed, my heart beating quietly,-yet it seemed as if&#xD;
some great splendor I had ever expected had rolled into a&#xD;
dark tomb, where lay buried halcyon fancies, and sweet&#xD;
exhulting hopes. Life, beautiful life, had lost its sunshiny&#xD;
glory : I must bow my head, and yield now to a daily routine&#xD;
of commonplace affairs, never daring to dwell on what I had&#xD;
dreamed, of fair ,and blissful. Alas ! to give up without&#xD;
having tasted one draught of life's best wine; without having&#xD;
seen one flower of joy bloom in celestial freshness: without&#xD;
having seen the sun arise, and flood my soul with a moon-&#xD;
tide brilliance : without having known the true significance of&#xD;
youth. Miss Bremer says, " And if this season ,of life's&#xD;
bloom last but a morning, it is still beautiful to have enjoyed&#xD;
it: with the bosom bathed in loVe and spring to have tasted&#xD;
the glory, of life. This ruddiness of morning casts a bewitch-&#xD;
ing splendor on the whole of after-life. One bears the heavy'&#xD;
days of earth much more readily when the heart hias once&#xD;
revelled in the fulness of happiness." .A profound gloom&#xD;
settled over my heart. ]I writhed under' my destiny, and&#xD;
yet felt that plain, common sense indicated a marriage with&#xD;

HIE LOVES ME !             25&#xD;
&#xD;
250             PERPLEXING THOUGHTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
James, as a sensible thing. As he had said, I could never&#xD;
expect a truer spirit to come to me. The world was large,&#xD;
and I was an orph an. II was weary now of standing alone,&#xD;
and longed for a strong, calm heart to direct my own. I&#xD;
wanted one whom I could look up to, and trust; one who&#xD;
would s~ay to me, "This is right," or "you axe wrong,"&#xD;
when I ~ravered in duty. Marriage had ever been to me so&#xD;
holy and beautiful-I had never even thought it a possibility&#xD;
that I gould marry one whose intellectual and spiritual&#xD;
nature was not exquisitely adapted to my own. When I&#xD;
thought of James as a husband there arose ~n instant con-&#xD;
seiottsn~ss of unfitness; and yet he was very ~dear to me. I&#xD;
sat down and pondered the subject after Jam~s had left me.&#xD;
Was I willin~ to leave my free girlhood-my independence?&#xD;
had I sufficie~'it love to bear the gre at suffering that accom-,&#xD;
panics the name of wife? Had I sufficient humility to tell&#xD;
him my heart story ?-for I could not yield my hand with-&#xD;
out utter fra~ikness. To these queries, my heart said "no."&#xD;
But as I gave him up in thought, I said, "It is a most&#xD;
sweet incense, the love of a noble human heart-how shall I&#xD;
break this strange spell that he ha~ wrapt around me? Who&#xD;
will ever love me again? Pliny ?-no! if he had loved me,&#xD;
he would have told me so. Grace's next letter will tell inc&#xD;
they are friends again. And even if. it should be that Pliny&#xD;
should ever care for me, I could not be won merely for the&#xD;
asI~ing-I would not accept a diluted love-I would turn&#xD;
away from him until I found that his love quite equalled my&#xD;
owl. But oh ! what wild and foolish dreamiugs! I started&#xD;
froinh the bench where I sat: the mail had come in. I had&#xD;
a letter. I felt that it would give mc tidings that would go&#xD;
down to my very soul. It was from Grace. I lifted my&#xD;
prayerful glance to heaven before' reading it; I pressed my&#xD;
hand upon my heart as if to strengthen it, for a wild combat&#xD;
had arisen within me. Every selfish impulse sprung like a&#xD;
&#xD;
giant to its work-I entrcated with~ a mad imploringuess&#xD;
that the knell of my happiness might not be sounded-poor&#xD;
Grace! how she would have grieved to have known that I&#xD;
loved my own joys so much better than hers. This day I&#xD;
had seen a vision of my probable life, and I turned away&#xD;
from it in such a chill despair; how could I part from the&#xD;
picture that had been clasped t~ my soul in girlish hope and&#xD;
joy! But the letter! I said with blind, cold faith, "Thy&#xD;
will be done! ~' ~nd then Ii broke the seal and read-aye! I&#xD;
read it all through, although the first words assured me that&#xD;
God had smitten my selfish prayers with refusal, and that he&#xD;
had crowned a nobler nature with his blessing. The letter&#xD;
had no date, and ran thus&#xD;
"~Kate1 he loves me !-yes! he loves me! The very&#xD;
heavens seem radiant with the words; every sweet sound&#xD;
seems to echo them-I catch them sleeping or waking. I&#xD;
repeat them softly 1x~ myself, while they create around me&#xD;
an atmosphere of bliss and enchantment. My soul is flooded&#xD;
with love-and pride. Yes! now I understand what pride&#xD;
is, in all its vastness and sweetness-and I would not be less&#xD;
proud than I am. Were the universe laid at my feet, and&#xD;
were all the best and bravest among men, kneeling there,&#xD;
the emotion would be paltry, compared with the triumph&#xD;
that swells my heart. He loves m~! and G&amp;amp;d has given me&#xD;
more than the universe. He loves me / and I defy the uni-&#xD;
verse, and time, and grief and fate. He loves me! and I&#xD;
shall sleep for ever benep±h the smile of heaven-never fear-&#xD;
ing, never doubting, whatever blows may fall. The dia-&#xD;
mond-life of eternity waits for us,-and let God give us&#xD;
what food He will,~-let Him lead us through cold, mystic&#xD;
paths, if He will. Hope shall say, 'All is well!' Grati-&#xD;
tude shall kne~I; and faith shall sing 'a new song unto the&#xD;
Lord.' I have heard it said that Love and Suffering arc&#xD;
sisters; that he who loves, trembles. But ah! this soul-&#xD;

252               PASSIONATE LOVE.                                                   A SUPPERING HEART.            253&#xD;
&#xD;
filling love has enabled me to comprehend the Deity: I can&#xD;
look up with smiles under any destiny, for I feel that the&#xD;
God who has created me with such in~mense capacities for&#xD;
happiness,-who has overflowed my soul with this lavish&#xD;
richness, must be ever giving a divine increase, albeit clouds&#xD;
may intervene between the human eye and the All-seeing&#xD;
one. If I do not turn away from the good, it cannot turn&#xD;
away from me. At night I kneel with clasped hands and&#xD;
streaming eyes, and pray to become worthy 6f this lot; pray&#xD;
for a heart to turn with fresh devotion and self-forgetfulness&#xD;
to the beloved souls wandering in cold and darkness, yet&#xD;
capable of this same splendid glory. Weary hearts that&#xD;
sigh,&#xD;
'It is this niggard halfuess that turns my heart to stone,&#xD;
'Tis the cup s~en, riot tasted, that makes the infant moan.'&#xD;
A celestial freshness from within the door of heaven is&#xD;
continually wafted though my spirit. It needs no argu-&#xD;
ment to convince me that I have found my twin-spirit, and&#xD;
that separation would be impossible, lit is this cOnviction&#xD;
of indissolubilitythat thrills me with the song 'Eureka.'&#xD;
How strange seems the contrast between this and my former&#xD;
love. Madam De Staci says, 'It is not first love that is&#xD;
ineffaceable: we love then, because our affections crave, an&#xD;
object.' In that wild, tumultuous love, I had always the&#xD;
conviction that my aspirations bore me above Giovanni, but&#xD;
iii the present ease, there is no hope, or upward dream, or&#xD;
expansive thought that does not meet an instatit oneness.&#xD;
But I shall tire you. By the way, Benzoni want to Europe&#xD;
weeks, ago. Your last letters have sounded sadly to me.&#xD;
Ah! do not doubt the coming brightness. You trust in&#xD;
God, and lijie has created our natures. We have not the&#xD;
right to fear. Darling, I feel as if I could bear you&#xD;
on my heart right up to heaven. Will you let me tell&#xD;
&#xD;
you, dear Katy, that sometimes there are sentences in yo~1r&#xD;
letters that do not sound so frank and warm as they might,-&#xD;
Qccasionally there is a bitterness, a vehement resistance to the&#xD;
God-given present, that makes me weep over the injury Katy&#xD;
is doing herself. Give up your will, and choose the paths of&#xD;
God's appointment, or it will be a long and weary way to&#xD;
your angelic home. This does not come gracefully from the&#xD;
lips of one so happy, and yet I know you will bear the truth.&#xD;
Aim! remember that the divine blessing fell upon dne who&#xD;
'loved much.' Don't you love me as you used to, Katy?&#xD;
Sometimes I fancy that southern home has chilled your&#xD;
heart; and eve I have ceased wondering at it, another letter&#xD;
comes steeped in warmest love, and bearing all the glow of&#xD;
our first friendship. But, my dear, I feel that you are not&#xD;
altogether at one with your lot. I know that the years will&#xD;
bring you into beauty, clearness, and repose; so have patience&#xD;
with the present, remembering that 'all things work together&#xD;
for good to them that serve God.' Your devoted&#xD;
"GRACE."&#xD;
I finished the letter, and slowly laid it on the glowing&#xD;
fire-" Thus, my God," I cried, "thus burn out the dross&#xD;
from my nature." And very quietly I sat down-what dif-&#xD;
ference did it make? I deserved it-yes, I needed it very&#xD;
much. I went to getting copies; but that did not stop&#xD;
thought, and a strange darkness came over my sight. I did&#xD;
not faint, I never could, but I laid my head down on the&#xD;
desk, and my heart ticked regularly, beat, beat, beat-how&#xD;
slowly it beat, and through what suffering each beat came.&#xD;
Poor James! what a miserable~being he had turned to for&#xD;
happiness-weak and weary, I felt now as if I could rest on&#xD;
his love; but as this thought came, an accusing angel sternly&#xD;
whispered, "This too is selfishness only-you would exist on&#xD;
his strength, and be a miserable burden to him-you desire&#xD;

&#xD;
his love, and cannot give a return." I listened to the stern&#xD;
angel, and I only answered, "0, for strength!"&#xD;
Two days had passed. flurrying feet passed to and fro&#xD;
in the house. Jessie hroke into my room, drowned in tears.&#xD;
"A little babe! but mother is dying!" she said.&#xD;
A Strange terror made my heart stand still 'a moment.&#xD;
"Who said she was dying, Jessie?"&#xD;
"Aunt Lucy! she dressed us children that we might go&#xD;
in the roo~n, if mother asked for us. But Aunt Addie sent&#xD;
me away from the door !'~ And Jessie flung herself upon&#xD;
the floor, in convulsions ~f tears and despair. ]I hurried&#xD;
down stairs, and met Mis~ Baldwin carrying a bundle of&#xD;
flannel: she placed it in 4iy arms, and whispered with stiff,&#xD;
pallid lips, "Take care of it: keep it in the school-room&#xD;
awhile, where it is warm. The noise troubles Minnie!"&#xD;
"How is she?" I asked.&#xD;
Miss Baldwin only shook her head, and burst into tears.&#xD;
She wrung my hand, and at last exclaimed, "If she dies,&#xD;
I'll murder that man. She has no hope to keep her up !-to&#xD;
leave her at this time! She will not take any thing !-~--she&#xD;
cares for nothing. Her mind wanders'; she calls 'Philip,'&#xD;
whenever her faint lips can form a sound. How can God&#xD;
allow one demon thus to crush another soul and body? an&#xD;
innocent like her?"&#xD;
"She might have died, if Mr. Henry h~tcl been ever so&#xD;
kind!"&#xD;
"No, she has been growing weaker, year by year, until&#xD;
her frame is broker~, as well as her heart. She has no dis-&#xD;
ease to fight against. She might have been spared to us&#xD;
many years, if the slow canker of grief had not exhausted&#xD;
her vitality. But take the babe up stairs. It is a girl, poor&#xD;
thing!"&#xD;
I bore the little one to the school-room, and sat down by&#xD;
the fire. It slept! oh! endless destiny that stretched before&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
its unconsciousness! how many tears it must shed! how&#xD;
many struggles must rend its heart. Alas! it could not re-&#xD;
treat from life. Jessie crept to me, and gazed upon her&#xD;
sister, then she lidd. her head against me, sighing. My own&#xD;
tears dropped; life seemed so heavy, so bitter, so full of&#xD;
palls. how could I hear it to the end? How brave phy-&#xD;
sical woe, as well as mental sorrow?&#xD;
I must give James an answer ere long. What should it&#xD;
be? It was a drear, December day. I looked into the&#xD;
leaden clouds: with that same cold gray, my once careless&#xD;
heart was shrouded now. The rain fell slowly; a drizzling&#xD;
mist was over the river, and over the distant woods. I dould&#xD;
see the road, where I sat: the bare branches of the trees&#xD;
overhung it. Rain, and mud, and miserable negroes were&#xD;
presented to my vision. Never had I. been in such a cow-&#xD;
ardly frame of mind. Jessie~started at every sound, hoping&#xD;
she might be admitted to her mother's room.&#xD;
"What shall we do?" she implored, looking up at me with&#xD;
folded hands. "I feel so unhappy. Can't you comfort me?&#xD;
Will mother go to heaven?"&#xD;
Poor' Jessie ! She pre~arcd a little bed for the baby,&#xD;
formed of two chairs, and as many pillows.&#xD;
"Let us kneel down here by the baby, darlingg" I said,&#xD;
"and pray to God to comfort us, and. to bless sour poor&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
She bowed her head, with a fresh gush of tears; then we&#xD;
softly repeated a prayer for the sick, which the children used&#xD;
when any of the family were ill. Jessie chsped her arms&#xD;
around my neck, and laid her head on my breast.&#xD;
"Jessie!" I whispered, "do you know that God would&#xD;
not let us have any pain, if we would be good without it?&#xD;
Do you know that you must be a guardian angel to this little&#xD;
baby, so when she grows up you may lead her by the hand to&#xD;
heaven? Do you know that ~ou ought to dedicate yourself to'&#xD;

&#xD;
0-od on this first day of her life, and implore Hint with your&#xD;
whole heart to make you good and pure, that you may not&#xD;
teach this dear innocent how to sin? This is a solemn day;&#xD;
an hour you ought never to forget! My darling, yoa will&#xD;
not forget 'your duty to this little angel ?"&#xD;
* "Never! oh! never! if God will help me! " she an-&#xD;
swered, raising her eyes upward with a holy lool~. "ilcad&#xD;
to me from the Bible-won't you ?"&#xD;
* I read the, seventy-first psalm, and love and courage rose&#xD;
with thankfulnes~ to God. "There's more beyond " this&#xD;
pain, was the strengthening thought that rose within me. I&#xD;
will not shrink from destiny, be it bright or daTh. I will&#xD;
clasp it ~o my breast, and strike from the darkness sparks of&#xD;
heavenly fire. T will turn away from myself, and study how&#xD;
to add to others' joys. But with this thought came a fresh&#xD;
pang. How to encounter cares and responsibilities, when&#xD;
my heart was dying? The suffering ~of Mrs. Henry had&#xD;
made me start back from the thought of marriage. The&#xD;
pleasure with which II had reg~irded James, vanished when&#xD;
saw that not repose alone, but perhaps excruciating suffering&#xD;
might be required of me~ as his wife. He seemed sudddnl&#xD;
changed from a delightful frietid into a stern Mentor, wh&#xD;
pointed out the hard places of life, and ~bade me take up in&#xD;
cross, and walk therein without' weakness or wavering. An&#xD;
yet II felt that after a long, long while I should love him a&#xD;
he deserved. "' It is destiny,-.it will come!" the word&#xD;
rang in my ears, and it seemed as if that calm voice had de&#xD;
cided my fate.&#xD;
The babe cried. I awoke from my revery, half smiling&#xD;
at the weakness with which I had pronounced th'e fiat of a&#xD;
strong man's will, my destiny.&#xD;
The' babe cried pitifully, incessantly; it seemed in great&#xD;
pain. I walked the floor, looking dow'n into the little dis..&#xD;
figured face with~ an infinite pity; I held it close to my&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
aching heart, and thquglit, "Poor little one, you did not ask&#xD;
a heritage of pain; " but still the wail went on.&#xD;
"Jessie, what shall we do?" I asked in deep despair.&#xD;
Co to the shanty, and bring nm~se Belinda."&#xD;
Jessie obeyed, and I continued my walk, mentally say-&#xD;
ing, "Can I ever be Mrs. Bedell ?-ever have wretched&#xD;
health likq Mrs. Henry ?-ever have wailing children, sick&#xD;
children, cross children? Can I watch through weary nights,&#xD;
and have distracting headaches next day? and James coin-&#xD;
in g in, thinking what a wretched home he has got? Can I&#xD;
bear all these wearing, terrible cares, without a surpassing&#xD;
love to sustain me?" The bright side of the picture never&#xD;
occurred tome.&#xD;
Jessie returned with Belinda, who rejoiced in being the&#xD;
mother of an ebon baby. She took the infant in her moth-&#xD;
erly arms, and I went down stairs. I met Aunt Lucy in&#xD;
the sitting-room. " May I see Mrs. ITenry?" I asked.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, Miss," sh&amp;amp; returned, softly opening the bed-&#xD;
room door, and giving me admission. The' room appeared&#xD;
dark at first. Miss Baldwin stood leaning against the foot&#xD;
of the bed, gazing upon Minnie, while great tears rolled un-&#xD;
heeded over her stern face. I turned to the invalid. She&#xD;
lay in her wan helplessness upon the pillow, her white lids&#xD;
half drooping over her blue eyes; the low, uneven breath&#xD;
ifattered from her parted lips. She looked indeed as if death&#xD;
were wQoing her. The doctor stood by, and kept his finger&#xD;
on her pulse. In my heart I felt that it would be sweet&#xD;
thus to see her pass away to the tender ones, who would&#xD;
take her to their hearts, recognizing the grace upon her&#xD;
brow. ~Her child-heai~t was made for a love sweet as angel's&#xD;
love. ' The doctor ~at down. I went and stood by her; she&#xD;
did not move, or raise her eyes, yet there was a slight mo-&#xD;
tion of the liPS. I bent my ear. The exhausted breath&#xD;
strove to give utterance to "Philip." Alas! were the truth&#xD;

of that wife's history realized, how soon would the mantle&#xD;

he bowed ovem a girlish face, and spoke words of delicate&#xD;

unpractised heart. I could not but think Mrs. Henry would&#xD;

TilE struggle was over. The die was cast. I could&#xD;
consent to place my hand within that of James. How&#xD;
parently slight a thing .~will alter the whole current of&#xD;
lives. If Mrs. Henry's illness had uot awakened me t&#xD;
perception of the cares and sufferings of married life&#xD;
should undoubtedly have beim the wife of James. K&#xD;
was, it was very hard to cast away his love. I dreaded&#xD;
hour of his coming. I dreaded to quell in his eye the Ii&#xD;
of flashing hope and joy that had so often met me-I drea&#xD;
to see the sunlight die out of ~his face. There had beei&#xD;
spell in his joyous spirits, a thrill in his glance, a volume&#xD;
feeling in his expressive face. I had never had lovers, o~&#xD;
should sooner have realized that my pleasure in his fric:&#xD;
sWp warranted him in believing he might hopc~ for mc&#xD;

times i[ had turned involuntaidly to meet with a smile&#xD;

perhaps reading my feelings in my face, he came forward. Ii&#xD;
gave him niy hand with drooping eyes. I thought then that&#xD;
peThap~ I might be his wife.&#xD;
I sat writing in the school-room. ii was sLartled by&#xD;
James, and yet I expected him, for the time had come. lie&#xD;
entered without rapping, I rose! How my heart beat! I&#xD;
stood still. He met mc with a look of most brilliant joy.&#xD;
I never saw a more glorious light in any coulite1m~vuce; it&#xD;
sought my face with the warm earnestness that seemed to&#xD;
dreab~ of an answering feeling. He did not speak; he of-&#xD;
fered his hand. I did not take it. I only said a slight&#xD;
" Good evening," with tremulous lips, then turned away to&#xD;
dispose of my writing-materials, and to gain the 'mastery of&#xD;
myself. He took a seat, and for some time was perfectly&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
"My God ! you are marble!" he said at last. The ex-&#xD;
tinguished light in his eyes made them look as if a dark cir-&#xD;
cle was around them: the blood had receded from his face&#xD;
and lips. I felt that it had also left my own. Cold and&#xD;
stony as death I felt, as I gazed upon his bowed head resting&#xD;
on his hands. I knew then, how my careless indulgence in&#xD;
present pleasure had been a crime; my cordial welcome, a&#xD;
wicked thing; my smiling glance, a cruel weakness And&#xD;
over me slowly came the anguish that heaved that noble&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
"~ I am answered!" he said, rising and looking at mc, yet&#xD;
not with inquiry. He extended his hand, and I gave him&#xD;
riilne.&#xD;
"God bless you always!" he said very gemitly, and then&#xD;
he left me.&#xD;
I would have said some kind word, but my heart seemed&#xD;
quietly frozen, and I could not speak. But after he was&#xD;
gone, a torrent of self-reproach rushed over me-a misera-&#xD;
&#xD;
ble feeling which it seemed as if nothing could expiate. I&#xD;
had been to blame in retaining him as a familiar friend so&#xD;
long. I threw myself on the bed; the long night waned,&#xD;
and no tears caine; only through my heart I heard the&#xD;
moans of that crushed spirit, which h~td turned to me for&#xD;
joy. The knowledge that his misery could not last very&#xD;
long, afforded no relief to my sense of his present condition.&#xD;

Minnie had dropped away into a soft slumber; it was her&#xD;
first refreshing sleep, and we looked down upon her white&#xD;
face with hope, for we had had terrible fears; the doctor&#xD;
had just, told us he had feared her disease would go to the&#xD;
braifi, and then if she did not die her reason might not re-&#xD;
turn. Miss Baldwin todk the babe, who had been named&#xD;
Ada, and went in the sitting-room. Over her brow for days&#xD;
a gloomy cloud had hung; within her eyes had slept a mis-&#xD;
erable despair. She did not speak, except when required to&#xD;
do so to any one. She hung over Minnie, as if every senti-&#xD;
ment of her being had concentrated into pity and woe. And&#xD;
yet Minnie was coming back to life. I followed her into the&#xD;
sitting-room, and sat down by her. The baby opened. her&#xD;
blue eyes innocently, as the violets look up from their lowly&#xD;
bed.&#xD;
"Let me take her," I said. "I can ahuost feel how near&#xD;

Miss Baldwin. resigned the child. I looked down in the&#xD;
infant's face, ~nd thought how wide was the contrast between&#xD;
those ~wo lives-the one a dew drop, just born, the Aother a&#xD;
.rushing river, chafing its way beneath a starless sky, over&#xD;
grim, uneven rocks.&#xD;
"I wish she had never been born," said Miss Baldwin,&#xD;
her face sinking into her hands) her elbows on her knees.&#xD;
"Why 'U' I asked.&#xD;
"For the same reason that makes me curse the day of&#xD;

FAITH IN GOD,&#xD;
&#xD;
my own birth. Because life has iio rest; we are led on from&#xD;
one petty misery to another ;~from one soul-coT~surning strug-&#xD;
gle to another. It ~s all weariness! Show me one huffian&#xD;
being who has escaped the rack, after waking up from the&#xD;
ignorance of childhood!"&#xD;
"Perhaps I could not point out one; bat who would be&#xD;
annihilated?"&#xD;
"I would."&#xD;
"Oh! can you not find any brightness any where under&#xD;
the sun?"&#xD;
"No, only darkness yawning beneath me, around me,&#xD;
above ine-there is no God, or He i~ more cruel than his&#xD;
miserable creatures."&#xD;
"But there is a God, ~nd if the world shook and reeled&#xD;
from beneath the foot of the Christian, the exulting certainty&#xD;
that God upheld him could not fail. Many griefs there are,&#xD;
but none like a loss of faith in God. The sheet anchor of*&#xD;
man's very being, is thus torn away from him.P&#xD;
"How do you know there is a God?"&#xD;
F' Because I otinnot know otherwise. My mind refuses&#xD;
to conceive a different thought. II feel the sunshine that&#xD;
comes from Him. I live in His breath. Faith in Him,&#xD;
fills existence with a glory that proves His power. Faith in&#xD;
Him, unravels the bitter mysteries that beset us, and sheds&#xD;
a clear light upon our path, when outward calamities would&#xD;
shroud us in darkness.&#xD;
'"II wish I could feel this faith. You do not prove to inc&#xD;
yet that there is a God."&#xD;
"11 cannot do so by argument, but I can tell you how to&#xD;
prove it to yourself."&#xD;
CC How'?"&#xD;
"Your life is worth nothing to you now, if you are wil-&#xD;
ling to be annihilated. Are you willing to make it of worth&#xD;
to yourself, by any effort ~r struggle, however desperate?"&#xD;
&#xD;
263&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
FORGIVENESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The spirits of evil have been struggling within me,&#xD;
until I have no strength. I cannot make any effort. I&#xD;
have reached the climax of despair~ I want to sleep atid&#xD;
die."&#xD;
"Then you have reached the moment to expect some-&#xD;
thing new. Set your foot down upon this unbelief, which&#xD;
brings more frightful agony than any misfortune which has&#xD;
ever overtaken you."&#xD;
"How can I?"&#xD;
"You have taken one step towards expelling the enemy,&#xD;
by speaking of your feelings. If you become willing to de-&#xD;
vote your life to others' good, you will believe in God-if&#xD;
you learn to forgive and pity, you will believe in God."&#xD;
She turned her eyes upon me with a sudden gleam, say.&#xD;
ing sternly, "Do you mean that I ought to forgive Philip&#xD;
Henry?"&#xD;
"Yes!&#xD;
"Then the matter is settled. I want no such doctrine.~~&#xD;
After a pause I said, "lit is well that man is not left to&#xD;
the mercy of man well that God does not turn from us&#xD;
with the loathing with which we turn from our sin-stricken&#xD;
fellows."&#xD;
"Are yon going to church?" she asked abruptly.&#xD;
Shall I ?" I asked, my heart sinking with pain at the&#xD;
little heed she gave, to my words.&#xD;
"I think you had better. Will you take Fred and Nel-&#xD;
lie? they are so noisy. Tony shall drive you."&#xD;
I prepared for church, and waited on the porch with the&#xD;
children for Tony to come with the carriage, It was a&#xD;
cloudy, cheerless day;' the gray sky seemed to hang low ovel'&#xD;
the' earth,' as if to shut out from human' thought all view' of&#xD;
the azure fields and the life-giving sun far above us. Tony's&#xD;
dark, yet ever bright face was lighted up with a dazzling&#xD;
smile of good humor. It shone across my heart a moment,&#xD;

&#xD;
as he handed u~ into the carriage. Who shall tell the worth&#xD;
of cheery looks and smiles, and who should grudge them,&#xD;
when they may shed a momentary brightnes  upon an aching&#xD;
heart? We did not go to the church we usually attended&#xD;
in the city. Mr. Bedell was in the habit of going there, and&#xD;
T could not bear to mpet him. We entered a stone church&#xD;
near by. A cold light shone through th~ stained windows,&#xD;
and fell upon the congregation ; the organ poured forth a&#xD;
low, sad harmony, in keeping. with the cold light within me&#xD;
and without me. We took our places in a shaded, quiet&#xD;
place; the old clergyman arose his locks were thin and&#xD;
scattered; his broken voice had neither strength nor comfort&#xD;
to offer. He preached upon the doctrine of "election." ii&#xD;
listened until II grew perfectly miserable. Hearts were&#xD;
gathered there, pining for th~ spirit-stirring sound of the&#xD;
gospel-for words of strength to help them in treading&#xD;
courageously over the rough ways of life. They needed a&#xD;
glorious motto from the pages of revelation~ that might ring&#xD;
trumpet-like on the spirit's ear, and inspire the tardy hand&#xD;
to buckle on the armor of salv~xtion, and fight the good fight&#xD;
of faith. The old man sat down; a younger man who sat&#xD;
in the pulpit with him arose and spoke ten minutes. He&#xD;
gave bread to the people: he belonged, to the one great,&#xD;
universal church; he preached the gospel to every creature.&#xD;
II thanked him in my heart for his words.&#xD;
It was raining heavily when we emerged into the lobby&#xD;
of the church. Tony carried the children to the carriage.&#xD;
I looked over the faces surrounding me, and met the glance&#xD;
of Mr. Bedell. He bowed withoufr suffering his eyes to&#xD;
meet mine, lie was at my side in a moment.&#xD;
"Will you walk down the steps with me?" he asked,&#xD;
raising his umbrella. I went.&#xD;
"Didn't you like what was last said ? ~' I asked.&#xD;
"Yes," he replied, but no smile came to his stern face.&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS PRIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
265&#xD;
&#xD;
lIe handed me into the carriage in silence, bowed again&#xD;
without suffering his eye to meet mine, and left us. I could&#xD;
~ot bear that the eyes whidh had beamed on me so tenderly,&#xD;
should grow chilling and careless in their glance-that his&#xD;
warm heart should grow liecdlcss of my fate. I selfishly&#xD;
wept to ikeep the incense, although my wayward spirit would&#xD;
not be bound; could not yet resign the rainbow I could&#xD;
never reach; ever it dissolved from sight, but its remem-&#xD;
'brance held me in thrall, and prophesied another.&#xD;
Soon after reaching home, I went down to the sitting-&#xD;
room. To my surprise Mr. Henry sat there. He nodded&#xD;
to me carelessly, in a manner quite at variance with the&#xD;
usual chivalrous courtesy of his demeanor. I guessed that&#xD;
I had fallen from the pedestal, and had become a very ordi-&#xD;
nary young person.&#xD;
CC~Theii did~ you get home?" I asked.&#xD;
This morning ! " be replied, tipping back his chair&#xD;
against the wall.&#xD;
"Have you seen Mrs. henry?" Ii continued, knowing&#xD;
what an event his return was to her.&#xD;
" Certainly !&#xD;
Ii went to the table for a book; by some means he 'had&#xD;
always found out my favorite authors, and they were strewed&#xD;
about the house. Every few days a new book had caught&#xD;
my eye. Frequently passages were marked therein. These&#xD;
books Mr. Henry had been in the habit of recommending to&#xD;
me. As ii was rummaging about for a Volume I had laid&#xD;
down in the morning, Mr. Henry said,&#xD;
"Do I see you in good health, Miss Prim?"&#xD;
I looked at him a moment, half angry that he had dis-&#xD;
continued his deferential bearing.&#xD;
"You have that felicity, sir!" I responded.&#xD;
"Saintly as ever, Miss Prim?"&#xD;
" More so, I think I"&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8254-00000134"/>&#xD;
"Indeed ?" I suppose~ you pray seven times a day now,&#xD;
don't you?"&#xD;
"I do when I feellike it!"&#xD;
"Do you pray for me?"&#xD;
"Sometimes."&#xD;
"What do you do that for, Miss Prim?"&#xD;
"' Because I fear you do more evil than good in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
He. gave a short hugh, and said, "What do you say&#xD;
when you pray for me&#xD;
"I pray that God will put it in your heart to be more&#xD;
worthy of your wife." II was half frightened as this speech&#xD;
escaped me.&#xD;
An angry spot flamed in Mr. Henry's cheeks; an impe-&#xD;
rioi~s fire darted from his eye. "That is my affair !"he ex-&#xD;
claimed, with the domineering expression I had seen him&#xD;
wear towards the servants when they offended him. It&#xD;
struck a defiant vein in my spirit I liughed bitterly aiid&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
" When a man holds a knife at his wife's heart, he thinks&#xD;
it his affair, but lookers-on entertaifi a different sentiment,&#xD;
and God sends him to judgment."&#xD;
Mr. Henry bowed haughtily and slowly, and took up a&#xD;
paper to read. I glanced out of th window, and saw Miss&#xD;
Harriet Thorne coming up the fron steps: ~he and Eghert&#xD;
had become adoringly attached. S me came in, but as she&#xD;
did nbt sqe her lover, she turned t Mr. Henry with great&#xD;
apparent delight. The red spot w s yet on his cheek, and&#xD;
his handsome lips were closed firml as he looked from his&#xD;
paper. I went into Mrs. Henry's room for half an hour.&#xD;
When I passed through the sitting room again, Mr. ILlenry&#xD;
was all fascination, and courteousness and wit to Miss liar-&#xD;
net. II thought he took ,a malicious pleasure in showing me&#xD;
with what merry satisfac Lion she talked with him, and in ap-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
peering himself captivated with her pretty face. I went to&#xD;
my room and read and wrote.&#xD;
"At the treatable, Mr. Henry said, "What a beautiful&#xD;
complexion Miss Harriet has."&#xD;
Eghert looked up delighted. " Iii never saw one like it,"&#xD;
he answered.&#xD;
"You never did ?" retorted Mr. Hehry gruffly. "Boys&#xD;
of your age should find something to do besides admiring&#xD;
pretty girls. I shall send you to New Haven to complete&#xD;
your studies."&#xD;
Egbert colored, and looked very much dissatisfied.&#xD;
"If your complexion were a little fairer, and your eyes a&#xD;
little bluer, Miss hamilton," said Mr. henry, "you might&#xD;
almost be taken for an elder sister of 'Miss Harriet's,"&#xD;
"Indeed! I have also been taken for Mr. Henry's&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
Yes," said Egbert, "I have been asked a great many&#xD;
times if Miss Hamilton and I were brother and sister."&#xD;
Two weeks after this conversation, E~bert went to Yale&#xD;
College. A half hour after he had gone, Miss Theme burst&#xD;
into my room overcome with grief; she flung her arms&#xD;
around my neck, crying very desperately.&#xD;
"Poor, Eg.! how he did hate to go," she sighed. "Wheu&#xD;
shall I ever see him again? 0,, dear!"&#xD;
"Suppose we sit down and compose our minds," I sug-&#xD;
gested, trying to look serious. She thought her grief so sin-&#xD;
cere, when I thought it so superficial, I could hardly refrain&#xD;
from laughing at her tears.&#xD;
"You good-for-nothing, heartless thing! You don't eare&#xD;
a fig," she said, catching a look at my face, and flirting h~r-&#xD;
self off into the school room.&#xD;
"Why, Miss' Thorne, you can't expect me to go into hys-&#xD;
terics too!" I said, deprecatingly, standing in the door of my&#xD;
room. "Egbert is a rear good, kind fellow."&#xD;

"I almost wish I had married him. Don't tell, Miss&#xD;
i}            Hamilton, for the world, but he wanted me to go to S&#xD;
and be married privately. II shall be so lonely. \VeIl, it&#xD;
will all go in a lifetime, I suppose. I'd rather have beaux&#xD;
than get married; it's more fun. He got down on his knees&#xD;
before me. I should have gone, if he hadn't done that: just&#xD;
Then, it darted through my head, that lie wouldn't kneel to&#xD;
ft            me after we were married, so .1 thought II would make him&#xD;
dance attendance on my whims a while longer." Miss&#xD;
Thorne's spirits brightened. She continued, "I have teased&#xD;
that fellow almost to death. Sometimes I'd pretend f didn't&#xD;
care for him, you know."&#xD;
aa               "Perhaps you didn't," I suggested.&#xD;
"Indeed, I did. It almost killed n~e to part with him&#xD;
this morning. See there!" She held out her hand to show&#xD;
inc a diamond ring, which Egbert had given her. "lsn't it&#xD;
pretty'? Oh! I'm going home to tease father to let me spend&#xD;
a week in 5-. How do you stand being c oop6'd up in a&#xD;
I&#xD;

and accordingly flew hdme.&#xD;
When she returned from S~, a week later she came to&#xD;
tell me the i~ews.&#xD;
"There's a letter from Eg.," she said, holding it up, so&#xD;
that I could see the superscription.&#xD;
"Ah! is he well'?" I asked.&#xD;
"Yes," she answered carelessly. "I shan't answers it,&#xD;
would you'?"&#xD;
"I would, certainly, if it were engaged to him."&#xD;
"He ought not to expect that II should bother myself&#xD;
with his letters every week. lIe can write just the same, if&#xD;
he wants to."&#xD;
"But you ought ~o break the engagement, if you cannot&#xD;
treat him with ordinary respect. Don't torture him with&#xD;
suspense for months. Do you intend to marry him'?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't know."&#xD;
"You ought to find out."&#xD;
" Oh, pshaw! don't preach. I liked him when he was&#xD;
here, and kept telling me how beautiful I was, and how he&#xD;
adored every little white finger, and how graceful I was, and&#xD;
how I sang sweeter than the birds, and all that; but as soon&#xD;
as he went away, I found I didn't care a straw whether I&#xD;
ever saw him again or not."&#xD;
"And you intend to let matters run on in this way'?"&#xD;
Yes; why not'? Very likely I may have him in the&#xD;
end, if I can't do better, II want more than one string to my&#xD;
bow. He's teal soft, don't you think so'? He's one of the&#xD;
kind that will hang on for ever."&#xD;
"And you abuse his constant nature, because he has little&#xD;
pride or spirit'?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, I do. I wish he were mikm like his ~&#xD;
" I don't."&#xD;
"i'm coming over this evening to play backgammonn with&#xD;
Mr. henry."&#xD;
"Did he ask you to do so'?"&#xD;
Yes, he did."&#xD;
"I think Mrs. Henry would rather you would not play&#xD;
with him, or m~eceive his eom~pliments with apparent plea-&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"Oh, dear! I'll do as I please about that."&#xD;
"But, Hattie, if you were a wife, and loved your husband,&#xD;
I'm sure it would break your heart to see young girls en-&#xD;
courage his attentions, and draw away all his love from you.&#xD;
When Mrs. henry is so weak and ill, you ought not to give&#xD;
her any pang5.~~&#xD;
" Fiddlestick! she needn't be jealous."&#xD;
"She would not. be without the greatest cause. She reads&#xD;
her husband's heart through, and comprehends his every&#xD;
glance. She is so good, so affectionate, so pure-hearted.&#xD;

"It is not innocent! It is wicked in this case. Have&#xD;
you not a woman's heart beating within you'? Have you no&#xD;
principle, no charity, or chastity of soul'?&#xD;
"You needn't take ~t upon yourself to lecture mc. It'&#xD;
was a condescension in me to offer my frieiidship to a mere&#xD;
governess.~~&#xD;
I laughed and said, "suppose you don't contaminate your&#xD;
little self by remaining here. When you can behave pretti-&#xD;
ly, you may visit me again, lit is school time now."&#xD;
Miss Thorne retreated, turning up her nose in a very dig-&#xD;
nified manner. II called after her,&#xD;
"You have dropped your letter, Miss Thorne." II met&#xD;
her half-way with it,&#xD;
"Good bye!" I said.&#xD;
"Good bye!" she returned very stiffly.&#xD;
In the evening she came over. She was all smiles, and&#xD;
seemed to have no recollection of the mornings dispute. She&#xD;
caught my dress, as~ II was about leaving the sitting-room,&#xD;
and whispered, "Dor~'t g~ up stairs; if you do, that horrid&#xD;
old maid will plant herself down here for the evening.~~&#xD;
Miss Baldwin was going t&amp;amp;bed with a sick headache. I&#xD;
sat down, and took out my work.. Mr. henry had been very&#xD;
attentive to his wife during her illness, always bringiPg her&#xD;
sonic delicacy to tempt her appetite, when he went to the&#xD;
city. She caine out to dinner upon this day for the first&#xD;
time; her face beamed with smiles. While Mi.. Henry and&#xD;
Miss Thorne were arranging their men on the board, I went&#xD;
into Mrs. Henry's room, to see if she were as well as usual,&#xD;
after sitting up so long. Aunt Lucy was arranging her&#xD;
blonde hair with the greatest precision. Mrs. Henry&#xD;
laughed, and said, "Aunt. Lucy thinks I am well enough&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ]YRAWING ROOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
to see a little more of the world than I saw at dinner, so I&#xD;
am coming out to spend the evening with you."&#xD;
"Don't Missus look like a lily, Miss'?" asked Aunt&#xD;
Lucy, surveying her with pride.&#xD;
"Yes, she does," I replied, thinking I had never seen her&#xD;
look so very lovely. She wore a light blue silk dressing-&#xD;
gown, girdled at the waist with a cord and tassel. A soft&#xD;
glow tinged her almost transparent cheeks; and her blue&#xD;
eyes beamed with ~i loving look. I could not forbear kissing&#xD;
her, and contrasting, her delicate beauty with the mere physi-&#xD;
cal attractions of Harriet Thorne. I went into the other&#xD;
room, and resumed my seat. Mr. Henry sat directly facing&#xD;
the bedroom door: it opened, and sweet Minnie entered, fob&#xD;
lowed by Aunt Lucy, who drew forward her arm-chair. The&#xD;
look on Mr. henry's face! I shall never forget. It rYveted&#xD;
itself, cold and repelling, upon the timid wife, as if to drive&#xD;
her back. I ~aw that it drank up her very heart's blood:&#xD;
her eyes dropped, and her cheeks grex~r white. She sunk in&#xD;
her chair, and placed her hand over her eyes.&#xD;
"It makes me faint to walk," she said, in a low tone.&#xD;
Mr. Henry started up, and handed her a glass of water&#xD;
from the table.&#xD;
"No," she answered, looking up in his face. He resumed&#xD;
his seat, looking very much vexed.&#xD;
"Take inc back, Aunt Lucy," said' Minnie gently. Mr.&#xD;
ilenry assisted ,in drawing her into the bedroom. Aunt&#xD;
Lucy had seen the look that greeted her idolized mistress:&#xD;
~he rolled up the whites of her eyes, and sighed profoundly..&#xD;
"Suppose you put the children to bed, Aunt Lucy," I&#xD;
said, "and' I will stay with Mrs. Henry awhile."&#xD;
She left the room. Minuiekept her hand on her fore-&#xD;
head. Ii sat down in a low scat by her, and laid my head on&#xD;
her knee, while I held the little hand that had dropped be.&#xD;
side her.&#xD;

THE RECOV~ERY RETARDED.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is cold to-night," I said, to arouse her from her pain-&#xD;
ful thoughts.&#xD;
She did not reply, but she gazed down in my face with a&#xD;
stony look: it was not pride; had Minnie been pron(l by via-&#xD;
ture, I should have left her alone; but her child-heart clung&#xD;
to others for support.&#xD;
"Do you feel stronger, dear?" I asked treniblingly, for&#xD;
her look went to my heart like a fearful bolt. She did not&#xD;
speak, but kept gazing at me with that strange, absent ex-&#xD;
pression. I rose and procured from the other room thQ dis-&#xD;
carded glass of water.&#xD;
"Drink this, Mrs. Henry," I said, presenLing it to her.&#xD;
She took it, and drank, then she turned her face aside, and&#xD;
kept her eyes fixed on th~ bed. I sat with her all the even-&#xD;
ing, and assisted Aunt Lucy in placing her in bed, for she&#xD;
was passive in our hands, an did not seem inclined to make&#xD;
the slightest exertion.&#xD;
~" Massa put her back ~ weck, Miss," whispered Aunt&#xD;
Lucy. I retired to my room with a strange fear at my&#xD;
hear+.&#xD;
"flow is Mrs. Henry?" I asked of Miss Baldwin in the&#xD;
morning ~tt breakfast.&#xD;
"About the same, I imagine," she returned. "If ana go-&#xD;
ing to the city to-day, Miss Hamilton. Try to amuse her,&#xD;
will yvi~, whenyoa are out of school ?"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly.&#xD;
I was hearing the children their morning lessons, when&#xD;
the school-room door softly opened, and 1~irs. Henry stepped&#xD;
in, and closed it behind her. Her eyes gleamed unnatui'ally.&#xD;
She had on thQ blue dressing gown; her fair hair was all&#xD;
unbound, floating around her: her snowy feet were thrust&#xD;
into embroidered slippers. My very heart died within me.&#xD;
Jessie and Ellen looked from her to me with blanched cheeks&#xD;
and dilated eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"I'm going to tell you all about it!" she said, slowly&#xD;
walking up and down. "That look! did you see it?"&#xD;
Wait a moment, Mrs. Henry!" I said. I dismissed&#xD;
the children.&#xD;
"Sit down now, won't yon?" I begged.&#xD;
"No, I can't!" she answered, continuing~ her walk. I&#xD;
prevailed on her to let me clothe her feet more warmly, and&#xD;
then she instantly resumed her proven ~de.&#xD;
"Iii thought,?' she said, "how glad ble would. be to see the&#xD;
dear babe when he got home. He kissed it, and he kissed&#xD;
me, and said I should soon be well. Sometimes whe~ he&#xD;
came in to see me, I was suffering acn~te pain, but I never&#xD;
let him know it, because he had once sa1id I was always teas-&#xD;
ing him - with my aches and pains. Oh! many a night I&#xD;
have laid awake, and never for an instaiat closed my e~es,~&#xD;
thinking I might die before help came, but Ii knew if I&#xD;
awoke him, how he would spe~k to me; and I thought it was&#xD;
so hard to make him love me, I would rather die than have&#xD;
him think Ii w~s only a trouble to him. Men are so different&#xD;
from us; they don't sympathize with our pains, because they&#xD;
don't have them to bear themselves. I have often wondered&#xD;
why God put all the agony on us. Christ bore all the agony&#xD;
on the cross to redeem mankind, and we have it all, bu~ we&#xD;
don't redeem any one by it." Sh~ sat down, and pressed her&#xD;
forehead, while tears fell in floods fi~om her eyes. She&#xD;
looked at me, through the blinding tears.&#xD;
"Why did God make us with hearts so much more ten-&#xD;
der than theirs? Was it so that they could kill us a thou-&#xD;
sand times over? If we should once commit a crime, that&#xD;
they commit a hundred times, we should be turned houseless&#xD;
from the door, and they would bid the world point the finger&#xD;
of scorn at us. Tell me, why is God so unjust?"&#xD;
"He is not, Minnie, dear !-How beautiftdly Jessie&#xD;
draws! Here is her last picture! Look!"&#xD;

She turned an indifferent glance upon it, and resumed&#xD;
the same train of thought. "Yes! God puts us here, the&#xD;
good to receive pain from ~e bad."&#xD;
"Do~s your head ache '~"Iasked.&#xD;
"It feels stran~cly!"&#xD;
I left her and went in search of Mr. Henry. He sat in&#xD;
the library.&#xD;
"Well, Miss Prim, what is your will?" he asked, turn-&#xD;
ing around, and speaking in the tone II so much disliked-it&#xD;
always seemed to impress me with the conviction' that there&#xD;
was not one human charm about me.&#xD;
"Ithink you ought to send for the doctor immediately,&#xD;
for Mrs~ Henry! "I said.&#xD;
"Hey! what is 'the matter?" he asked, looking a little&#xD;
startled.&#xD;
"I fear her mind is a little affected !" I answered. I&#xD;
returned to the school-room, and resumed the task of striv-&#xD;
ing to direct Minnie's thoughts, hoping, oh! so earnestly, to&#xD;
see the old interest in little things. I longed for Miss Bald-&#xD;
win's return from the city, and yet I dreaded it. The doctor&#xD;
came, and he left us weeping~ Yet we hoped a night's sicep&#xD;
would restore our broken lily. She was quietly in bed when&#xD;
Miss Baldwin came home; her face was turned to the wall,,&#xD;
as if she were asleep, but she was not. Aunt Lucy suggested&#xD;
that we' should not tell Miss Baldwin how Mrs. Henry had&#xD;
been, as it would only frighten her, and our patient might&#xD;
* be better in the morning. The night set in dismally: howl-&#xD;
ing winds roamed about the house, and seemed to rack it.&#xD;
Tha, servants set up late, fearing to go to bed. I had fallen&#xD;
into my first sound slumber, when soul-harrowin~ shrieks&#xD;
b&#xD;
awoke me: they broke upon my senses with the terrific fear&#xD;
oi~ie sometimes experiences in dreams. I half started up,&#xD;
and my first exaggerated thoughts were, that seine part of&#xD;
the house had been blown in, killing some of the family; or&#xD;
&#xD;
j&#xD;
&#xD;
SHE IS C1~AZED.&#xD;
&#xD;
275&#xD;
&#xD;
that Mr. Henry was murdering his wife. The night was&#xD;
pitch dark: I struck a light, and threw on a dressing gown.&#xD;
By this time I heard feet passing in the hall. I went out:&#xD;
Miss Baldwin, white as ashes, was hurrying down stairs;&#xD;
the servants were following at prudent distances. I has-&#xD;
tened after them. As we neared Mrs. Henry's room, I dis-&#xD;
tinguished the burden of those heart-rending cries.&#xD;
"You are leaving me! You will leave me!"&#xD;
The sad mystery was made clear. Reason had wholly&#xD;
forsaken the unhappy wife. Miss Baldwin burst into the&#xD;
chamber, speechless with surprise 'and fear. Mr. Henry sat&#xD;
in LIfe arm-cl~~ir, by the bed, in boots and dressing gown:&#xD;
me arm was t arown around Minnie, one hand held hers, still&#xD;
~he looked in his face, and imploringly shrieked,&#xD;
"You will leave me! "and her moans and expressions of&#xD;
despairing helplessness were more pitiful than her wild cries.&#xD;
Miss Baldwin stared on her with dilated eyes: she was nailed&#xD;
to the floor. Minnie took no notice of us.&#xD;
"Pear lamb ! oh! Missus!" sobbed Aunt Lucy. This&#xD;
was a sign for the rest of the servants: their impetuous tears&#xD;
streamed forth. Miss Baldwin motioned to them to leave&#xD;
the room. She then turned to me, as if not deigning to&#xD;
trust Mr. Henry's account.&#xD;
"How was she yesterday? "-her eyes seemed to look&#xD;
through me.&#xD;
"She did not seem wholly herself!" I answered.&#xD;
"Did you send for a physician?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
She went to Mrs. Henry, and took one white hand very&#xD;
gently. "Minnie, Minnie, darling!" she spoke in deepest&#xD;
accents of entreaty, but Minnie only looked at her as if she&#xD;
did not comprehend her, and whispered,&#xD;
"Will he go&#xD;

&#xD;
"No! child, I shall not go!" Mr. Henry answered; then&#xD;
looking at us, he said,&#xD;
" She has been talking all night. I rose to dispatch a&#xD;
~ervant for the doctor, when she began to scream lest IL&#xD;
should leave her." Miss Ba~dxvin stepped into the adjoining&#xD;
room, and sent Jep for the physician; she caine back,&#xD;
and stood in silence gazing upon her sister for an hour or&#xD;
more. Then sh.e bade Aunt L~cy stay with her mistress,&#xD;
and she left us. II also stole to my chamber: Jessie and&#xD;
Ellen, full of vague fears, begged to creep in bed with&#xD;
me. Their warm, clasping arms seemed to protect me from&#xD;
utter dreariness. Sleep was impossible. I felt too keenly&#xD;
that the Mighty Refiner would not spare-the ~world seemed&#xD;
a vast crucible. Who cc~uld escape?&#xD;
When the gray dawn broke, I rose softly, 'half envying&#xD;
the rosy sleep of the two children. Miss Baldwin did not&#xD;
come down to breakfast. The doctor had remained; he ad-&#xD;
vised Mr. Henry not to leave his wife; if lie but stirred, ai~&#xD;
expression of agony flashed. over poor Minnie's face. Mr.&#xD;
henry looked out of the window longingly, and cold gleams&#xD;
fell upon the unconscious wife from his large eyes. I sLid-&#xD;
dered to think how fe~rfnl a thing it was, for an aff~ctionato&#xD;
woman tljius to be bound Prometheus-like to a cold heart,&#xD;
ever receiving mortal wounds, yet unable to tear away her&#xD;
clinging soul, albeiL it was perishing under the strokes that&#xD;
fell. Whenever IL happened to be in the bedroom, Mr.&#xD;
Henry looked very resigned to his lot; but when I chanced&#xD;
to observe him from the sitting room, I saw that his only&#xD;
care ~as to ,escape from the trouble of heeding the sufferer.&#xD;
In this he -could not succeed, and I rejoiced from my heart&#xD;
in ha~iing him share the fatigues of a sick chamber. He&#xD;
always thought it was nothing for Minnie to be prisoned in&#xD;
her room from one w~ek to another. He conceived it to be&#xD;
every one's duty to adapt themselves to circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was nearly dinner time. II wondered Miss Baldwin&#xD;
did noteome down. I went to her room, and tappedat the&#xD;
door. She bade me enter. ~he sat by the bedside; her&#xD;
face resting on it, she did not lift it up. I almost feared&#xD;
to speak to her, lest she should give me a 'haughty, abrupt&#xD;
answer. She was still in her dressing gown; her hair was&#xD;
disordered, as when at midnight she was startled from her&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
"It is time to dress for dinner," I said.&#xD;
She looked up. Alas! how the storm had swept through&#xD;
her being, leaving its traces upon her haggard face. With a&#xD;
weak, unsteady I~and, she strove to gather up her still abun-&#xD;
dant hair.&#xD;
'~ Shall Ii comb it?" I asked, handing her brush and&#xD;
comb.&#xD;
"No!" she briefly answered: her cold, hard tone wound-&#xD;
ccl me, and tears sprung to my eyes. Ii turfied to leave her&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"how is Minnie?" she questioned.&#xD;
"The same!" I answered, not turning towards her lest&#xD;
she should see how I felt.&#xD;
" Miss Hamilton ?"&#xD;
I looked at her.&#xD;
"I am very hopeless now. Do I seem unkind? "~&#xD;
Not now ! "&#xD;
"What shall we do?" she spoke with a kind of despe-&#xD;
rate despair.&#xD;
"We can only live by the day, and hope for brighter&#xD;
times. She will probably recover."&#xD;
Miss Baldwin shook her head. "There is a conviction&#xD;
here too mighty for hope; she will not recover." She laid&#xD;
her hand upon her heart. "There is a God," she continued&#xD;
gloomily, "for only omnipresence could see where to aim the&#xD;
blows that have struck me from my youth up. I have fallen&#xD;

&#xD;
TRUST TN GOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
at last! Minnie was my all, my idol. How can I be a&#xD;
mother to those children !-that poor unhappy babe?"&#xD;
"We will bear the care together. I have heard of n~ny&#xD;
instances where tQmporary loss of reason has seemed to&#xD;
cleanse the heart of its griefs-with he~ilth, a healing wind&#xD;
has blown freshly through the spirit. It may be so with&#xD;
Minnie! There is a wise reason for this dispensation; it is to&#xD;
forward success of somb kind. If she should die, we know&#xD;
that she would go to heaven: she is an unpretending Chris-&#xD;
tian."&#xD;
"And I am not ! " Miss IBaidwin slowly said. " Tell&#xD;
me, and she seized my arm with sudden eagerness, and&#xD;
looked searchingly into my eyes, "do you think your God&#xD;
loves you when He smites you?"&#xD;
"I know Ife does, Miss Baldwin!"&#xD;
"Havo you suffered ?-deeply?"&#xD;
"Ithinklhave!"&#xD;
"Did you then dare to trust the disposal of your life to&#xD;
God ?.-did you not wish to shrink from his severity? "&#xD;
"Yes, I did at times! ]i wished I could arrange my life&#xD;
myself-I wished I could put back suffering."&#xD;
"And now?"&#xD;
"Now I only want to keep the Lord's path; if my yearp~-&#xD;
ing would turn me out of it, I want to be forced into it by&#xD;
omnipotence-because the end will be all I can desire."&#xD;
Miss Baldwin sat down, and supported her fQrehead on&#xD;
her hand. After being buried in thought some time, she&#xD;
said, "Doe~ it not seem cruel to you that so sweet a creature&#xD;
as Minnie should have had such an unhappy life?"&#xD;
"It seems very sad; but if a moment's pain would buy&#xD;
her a year of bliss, would it be wise to attach too much&#xD;
importance to the moment? You will think thus of her&#xD;
earth-life when you see her in heaven."&#xD;
The dinner bell rang; IL hastened down stairs. Miss&#xD;

PURE GOLD.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Baldwin said she did not wish any dinners but she came&#xD;
down in the afternoon, and with a new energy began to&#xD;
take charge of every thing. I saw that the pure gold of&#xD;
her nature wa's reached: she was all tenderness to Minnie;&#xD;
all devotion to the babe, all patience to the children, all&#xD;
* kindness and forbearance to the servants ;-but she toiled&#xD;
for light like one blind and weary.&#xD;

dHA~\PTER XXV.&#xD;
THE spring buds had swollen, the tender leaves had put forth,&#xD;
the fresh blade of grass yielded to the willing foot. The&#xD;
resurrection-song was humming far and near. If spring&#xD;
came but once in a lifetime, it would steep tl1e sluggish heart&#xD;
with presentiments of never-Qeasing life and love ,-it would&#xD;
seem a pledge of immortal joy and youth,-it would wing&#xD;
the earth-weary thoughts with exultation, and drop a healing&#xD;
nectar upon the wounds im7made by unbelief But the glorious&#xD;
emblem of renewed youth is given every year,-~and ye~&#xD;
man ofttimes reads not the bright truth pi~tumd in th~&#xD;
sudden glory of the woodland: in vain the unsightly branches&#xD;
bend with a new grace above the singing stream, while ram&#xD;
turous music floats through the sunshiny air. The heart&#xD;
of nature beats with ecstasy, and strives to whisper to the&#xD;
sleeping heart of man, that his cold hours may be followed&#xD;
by spring and summer.&#xD;
Winter had bound our hearts with a sterile coldness.&#xD;
All was dreary within. Minnie was not restored to health:&#xD;
she wandered about like a shadow-a miserable, devouring&#xD;
anguish impressed upon her features. She could not bear&#xD;
to be alone night or day, and she clung to us for comfort,&#xD;
until our souls were exhausted with giving, and drinking in&#xD;
the essence of her pain. Poor Minnie! when reason was&#xD;
&#xD;
hors, she bad hold her sorrow in cheek, weeping her tears in&#xD;
silence; but nature was now revenged, the suffering wQuld&#xD;
speak. Miss Baldwin was preyed upon by the deepest&#xD;
melancholy. Mr. Henry was mOrose, and often spoke to&#xD;
~ Minnie, when she unwittingly did annoying things, with&#xD;
a harshness that drove a sharp arrow to Miss Baldwin's&#xD;
heart, and made me wish ha would leave home. Miss Bald-&#xD;
win naturally turned to me for cheer, as ahe had no one else&#xD;
to go to, and I longed for words of strength from a godlike&#xD;
nature. Ji looked back to my Boston home with weak re-&#xD;
grets; its healthy air, I felt, would help to brace my heart, and&#xD;
make inc strong to hear and do. Thus, in weariness, do we&#xD;
always ask for a change of place, and cry out for another&#xD;
path than the appointed one. Mrs. Henry had always been&#xD;
the charm of the hous&amp;amp; to visitors: they had ceased coming,&#xD;
since her lovely face had ceased to greet them. Ever since&#xD;
the bloom had returned to ~tree and flower, I had been&#xD;
eager to walk out alone, and receive courage and inspiration.&#xD;
I stole, away and strolled by the river side. lit seemed like&#xD;
escaping from a dark prison, thus to wander at will, and my&#xD;
heart revived with the strong, sweet hopes of old. I laughed&#xD;
at the past, sombre thoughts which had enchained nie, and.&#xD;
fancy bounded onward to the splendors yet in store! a pro-&#xD;
phetic exultation assured me that bliss was waiting for me.&#xD;
What mattered present impediments? I threw down the&#xD;
gantlet to the foe. As I walked in the clear, blessed air,&#xD;
and caught the tender song of birds, i[ felt strong enough to&#xD;
moot my destiny, whatever it might be. The soft spring&#xD;
breath carried away all regrets. Dui:ing the winter "the&#xD;
shadows lay upon me," and very often I regretted that I had&#xD;
driven James from me. He was strong and cheerful. The&#xD;
golden bowl was broken, and I should have taken the silver&#xD;
goblet, but now I did not so reason: all was well.&#xD;
Just before I left the house, I had received a letter from&#xD;
&#xD;

A LETTER FROM GRIWE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Grace; I had not read it. Her happy letter I had not&#xD;
answered for a long time; then one or two had miscarried&#xD;
which she had? written; now it had one from her. I sat&#xD;
down under a great tree by the i~iver side, to read it.&#xD;
DEAR KATY.-I do l~ope this letter will reach you ! It&#xD;
is so provoking to have letters miscarry. Katy, I can't write&#xD;
about much except my happiness. I believe I have ijot told&#xD;
you how we became reconciled, or if I have, it seems you&#xD;
did not get the letter. Well !-but first T must toll you that&#xD;
my heart beats as blissfully now as wheli I wrote the first&#xD;
news about it; down deeper in my heart goes stealing the&#xD;
strong conviction of ever-inbreasing love, joy and rest. The&#xD;
mighty plan of life domes before my gaze-I see the powor&#xD;
of love to win a~l things into beauty and harmony. It is&#xD;
the impulse of unregenerate man to drain his cup of glad-&#xD;
ness away from the sorrowful i but to the regenerating heart,&#xD;
love becomes more powerful, when two, hand in hand, look&#xD;
forth upon the world, and give out their happy strength to&#xD;
those who need it. Then, when they return to their quiet&#xD;
ark together, they see that a diviner beauty has come to it,&#xD;
while they had gone forth ;-a rarer freshness has touched&#xD;
it, and new sweetnesses haves pressed their way within it.&#xD;
It is a sad but righteous justice when love dies out from the&#xD;
hearts of the dissolute. Ah! I wonder sometimes if cold&#xD;
philosophers would not gladly have their dry heart,3 human-&#xD;
ized with th6 rich warm glories of this love they laugh at!&#xD;
A pitiable laughter! it is like the raillery of the withered&#xD;
crone upon youth and loveliness! But to my story: Thanks&#xD;
fo~ bidding me unlock ~: my innermost." Oh, Katy, you do&#xD;
not know how many weary days I passed in watching, sus-&#xD;
pense and heavy disappointment. After we made that visit&#xD;
at Blooming Hill, I. looked daily to see the face of Mr.&#xD;
Waldron, but he did not come. I met him at a party one&#xD;

evening. When his eyes fell on me, I felt that my home&#xD;
was in his spirit: how full of earnest sadness was his look.&#xD;
Tie caine to me: we passed the compliments of the evening,&#xD;
and talked about a new book, but he left me as soon as he&#xD;
could find an excuse to do so. My ver~r heart seemed&#xD;
choked-~-stified. I seemed to see that the glory had departed&#xD;
from my life,-that henceforth II must tread a flinty path&#xD;
alone, lIe often looked at me during the evening, and&#xD;
soinetimn6s I felt sure that time impulse to come to me was&#xD;
strong upon him. But he did not.&#xD;
Arid then weeks, even months, passed by. I sat here in&#xD;
the parlor alone one afternoon; suddenly I heard his voice&#xD;
in the hall. I sprang up to meet him; I never thought of&#xD;
his coldness. lie came in, and looked at inc one half instant.&#xD;
I was smiling, and my soul was looking in his eyes. I could&#xD;
not turn away from the magnetic gaze that drew me, at first.&#xD;
~f lien my eyes dropped. He took me within his arms, and&#xD;
murmured, " Grace !&#xD;
He had never called me by that name before, and it&#xD;
caine from his lips in a tone so infinitely tender, so protect-&#xD;
ing. My soul surrendered itself to him with a thrill of&#xD;
heavenly ecstasy. Over me came the thought, "his for life,&#xD;
for death, for immortality." I have been in a delicious dream&#xD;
since then. We forgot all explanations for hours that day;&#xD;
I thought they were moments, Kate. "And why?"-Iat&#xD;
length asked him, looking in his eyes, without finishing the&#xD;
sentence.&#xD;
"I thought you loved l3enzoni until this day !" ~ie&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
"Benzoni!" I exclaimed in utmost surprise; "why?"&#xD;
" One evening at Blooming Hill, Grace, I was in the&#xD;
Post-Office, when you dropped in a letter addressed to him."&#xD;
"And for so slight a reason-"&#xD;
"No! not for that. The Jmext evening I walked over to&#xD;

&#xD;
284            THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Cardover's to tell you what was in my heart, Grace.&#xD;
I entered a side gate, and started on my way to the house by&#xD;
a winding path; the shrubbery concealed inc from view. Ii&#xD;
saw y~u hasten from the house to the summer-house. Beuzeni&#xD;
met you at the door, and caught you to his heart :you dis-&#xD;
appeared inside. I went homeward: yet for week~ I strove&#xD;
to believe that you could not love that man. I learned that&#xD;
his wife was dead, and that you .were engaged to him. By&#xD;
some happy fortun~ I called on Miss Cardover to-day; she&#xD;
spoke of you, and I asked when yqu were to be married to&#xD;
Mr. Benzoni. I had. not been able to bi'ing myself to ask&#xD;
questions abo t you, or I might long since have found out&#xD;
the truth. M ~ss Cardover explained all to me; the ue~'se-&#xD;
cutions of Mn Benzoni; that he was not a widower, 'and&#xD;
that he had at last gone to Europe. And then ]I came to&#xD;
meet you, 0-race."&#xD;
That w~s long ago, Katy. How I long to see you, to&#xD;
tell you all our plans. Will you be my bridesmaid, cousin&#xD;
mine? Horace proposes' that we shall be married imme-&#xD;
diately, in order to defy the little fates, who deerce that,&#xD;
"The course of true love nev~r dbl run smooth."&#xD;
But we are going to wait your return. James Beddli is visit-&#xD;
ing at Miss Cardover's; he seems rath5 pleased with C or-&#xD;
trude: she has really grown to be a handsome girl, eminently&#xD;
practical and agreeable; she seems to think James is the most&#xD;
sensible, the most intellectual, afid the most profound of men.&#xD;
Poor Mrs. Henry and Miss Baldwin! I am glad for&#xD;
their sakes that your lot is cast with them. Will you not&#xD;
come home in the fall? I cannot bear to think of getting&#xD;
married'~ unless' you are here. Mary and the children send&#xD;
love. Horace bends his also.&#xD;
Good-bye, my darling.&#xD;
GRACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I did not read, this letter all at once. I stopped at the&#xD;
name of Mr. Waldron as if I had fallen into a bewildering&#xD;
dream-i feared I should wake and find it such. I looked&#xD;
at the river. Yes! it flowed on actually in real dimpling&#xD;
brightness; the buds werc ti3uly sweilino' on the trees-the&#xD;
tiny spring flowers were rising from among the brown, wintry&#xD;
leaves-i plucked sonic. Then I w~t on reading the letter,&#xD;
while my soul seen~ ed floating in clouds of amazement.&#xD;
What could it mean. Grace did not lov~ Pliny! it was Mr.&#xD;
Waidron that she had loved all the tPine. How could I have&#xD;
been so deceived? What was it which had led mc to think&#xD;
she had loved Mr. Card&amp;amp;ver. Au! it broke over inc now:&#xD;
he loved her, and II had mistaken her embarrassment for a&#xD;
different feeling. Alas! he had turned to her; it pained&#xD;
inc all over in my thoughts to feel that I had never had any&#xD;
attraction for him. But it was sweet to my pride to know&#xD;
that my own soul was the only temple fbi' my secret. ii&#xD;
wondered if he ever turned his thoughts southward if I&#xD;
still seemed like tile C~ sister Kate" of our first acquaintance.&#xD;
I wondered if Miss Cardover ever read him my letters, which&#xD;
Grace sometimes lent her. I wondered if I stood before his&#xD;
fancy as one sublimely indifferent to him-i hoped so. Love&#xD;
is so beautiful and yowerf~il, it should live iu silence in hu-&#xD;
man hearts, if it cannot meet as beautiful and powerful a&#xD;
response: water should not be given for wine.&#xD;
And James! I had not heard of his going North at all.&#xD;
He had not entered Mr. Henry's house since w~ parted on&#xD;
that unhappy night. Ii wondered if he would soon come&#xD;
back to the South, and if he 'was really pleased with Ger-&#xD;
trude. How many thoughts I had that spring day down by&#xD;
the river side.&#xD;
But my little holiday was nearly over: I mus~t go back&#xD;
to my prison, and see gloomy faces tur~ied to me for some&#xD;
support. So I rose and walked slowly towards the handsome&#xD;

villa which was my home. As Ii looked towards it, and&#xD;
thought one would imagine it the abode of love and peace, I&#xD;
saw a gentleman descending the front steps. It was James.&#xD;
I met him at the gate.&#xD;
"Did you call to see me?" I asked, extending my hand,&#xD;
and reading only kindness in his face.&#xD;
"Yes. I have seen your friends in Boston," he re.&#xD;
turned.&#xD;
"Will ~ou come in again, James?"&#xD;
"Not td-day. I came to say that I found Mrs. Rod&#xD;
man's family all well: they hope to see you in the fall.&#xD;
He looked far mCre cheerful than when I had la~st seen him&#xD;
"Are we good friends, James?" I asked, looking ~t him&#xD;
for the forgivei~ess I needed.&#xD;
"I trust we are, Kate," he answered.&#xD;
"And you have not been angry with me ?-have not&#xD;
thought I deserved blame?"&#xD;
He hesitated, and then spoke with the frank boldness of&#xD;
his honest nature. "II have thought you deserved blame;&#xD;
you encouraged 1110 whqn you knew what my hope was."&#xD;
"Ii have blamed myself for it; it was unpremeditated.&#xD;
I am sorry I did so: you seemed like a brother."&#xD;
A sudden tenderness gleamed in his face.&#xD;
"Good-bye!" I said, opening the gate,' determined that&#xD;
he should not blame ~me again for encouraging the kind looks&#xD;
I loved to see.&#xD;
"Good-bye!" he said, bowing low. And then he went&#xD;
away.&#xD;
The children were playing on the lawn. Minnie stood&#xD;
in~ the front door, looking off wistfully towards the distant&#xD;
woods. As II neared the house, she ran in and obtained Jes-&#xD;
sie's sun-bonnet.&#xD;
"May I walk with you, Miss Hamilton?" she asked'&#xD;
appealingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes indeed, dear Minnie!" Ii replied, delighted to find&#xD;
that'she cared to go. 'The doctor said 'when she began to&#xD;
cc~re for any thing it would be a good symptom. So she&#xD;
came down the steps, and put her arm around my waist, ai7ld&#xD;
I put nlil2LO about her, and we slowly walked back to the&#xD;
river, talking about the sweet awakening of spring life. All&#xD;
winter Minnie had sat with' folded hands near us, and h~d&#xD;
followed us when we went into another room. Sometimes&#xD;
she had seemed a little excited and wild, but now' she was&#xD;
gently docile, and a new hope awoke for her restoration~&#xD;
After a short walk we went back to' tile house. Miss Bald~&#xD;
win sat on tile piazza with her work; the children were still&#xD;
at play. ' We sat down on the steps. "Shall I tell you&#xD;
about Miss Jiartly?" asked Minnie, raising her blue eyes to&#xD;
mine, one elbow rested on my knee. "Shall Ii, Adelaide?"&#xD;
she appealed to her sister.&#xD;
"Perhaps you had better not, dear," returned Miss Bald-&#xD;
win, in the gentle tone she had always used towards Minnie&#xD;
since her affliction. "I will tell her some time myself. See!&#xD;
Freddie is calling you."&#xD;
Minnie ran down the steps, and sat down on the grass to&#xD;
~yatdm thc children.&#xD;
'~ How beautiful she was, the first time she entered that&#xD;
gate as its mistress," said Miss Baldwin~ "she was more of&#xD;
a child than Jessie is now. She was but fifteen, and she&#xD;
laughed and danced about with her ringlets flying, her eyes&#xD;
sparkling, and her cheeks brighter than the rose. She gave&#xD;
Mr. Henry a chase around the grounds; he caught her at&#xD;
last, and brought her in his arms, laughing, until he placed&#xD;
her on the piazza. He used to take her out to ride every&#xD;
day, and whenever the ground was damp, he would say,&#xD;
"Come, fairer!" she used to spring in his arms from the&#xD;
top step, and he would carry her, to the carriage, lie made&#xD;
a perfect idol of her during the first year of their marriage;&#xD;

&#xD;
and she had such pretty, winning ways. Long, long, before&#xD;
Minnie ever suspected it, Ii knew that her husband was un-&#xD;
faithful to her. The Miss Hartly she spoke of was one of&#xD;
his last victims. I have thought lately that I might ha~ e&#xD;
been too hard with the poor girl. She wa~ a young; artless&#xD;
creature, and she thought Mr. Henry an angel of ligbt for a&#xD;
long time. He undermined her faith in existing customs,&#xD;
with a subtlety and slowness that might have corrupted an&#xD;
older and wiser he~ad. She believed fQr a long tune that&#xD;
Minnie was all deceit, and persecutedd her h~isbaJ in a thou-&#xD;
sand sly ways. But as soon as her ruin was accomplished,&#xD;
she was overwhelmed with the wildest grief and re~norse she&#xD;
went to Minnie, threw herself at her feet, and besought her&#xD;
to take her life. What do you ~think Minnie did? Why,&#xD;
she cried over her as if her heart would break. She was at&#xD;
last convinced of her husband's guilt. She took a huiYdred&#xD;
dollars from her drawer, placed theni in Miss ilartly's hand,&#xD;
and bade her seek sonie sheltered spot, where God would&#xD;
have mercy on her. I gave the girl scornful, vehement&#xD;
blame, as she left the door. Mr. Henry had left for the&#xD;
North, as soon as Minnie found the matter out. You were&#xD;
here on the night of his return, and saw how agitated Miii-&#xD;
me was.&#xD;
"And what has become of that poor girl ?" II asked.&#xD;
" She is in a small town in Virginia. She had an infant,&#xD;
but it died. She wrote to Minnie that she was employed as&#xD;
a servant. She did not consider herself fit to be a governess.&#xD;
She returned ten dollars of the sum Minnie gave he~', and&#xD;
hoped at some time to pay it all back."&#xD;
"Poor girl !" I could not help sighing, as I recalled the&#xD;
lovely face Jessie had once showed me; and II felt that her&#xD;
soul was chaste and white, compared with that ef her seducer.&#xD;
Unhappy one! how in her dismal loneliness must she sigh&#xD;
for words of hope and che6r. How must she long for a pity-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing, outstretched hand! The fact of her not remaining in&#xD;
sin, proved her to be worthy Qf that mercy which was not&#xD;
denied to the adulteress. I could not help respectin~' 11cr for&#xD;
bowing her neck to drudging toil, that she might expiate her&#xD;
sin.&#xD;
"1-las she no relatives, Miss Baldwin ?" I asked.&#xD;
"She ha~ a brother, but ho has never known her shame."&#xD;
"Don't you pity icr from your soul, Miss Baldwin?&#xD;
Oh! what a desolate lot!"&#xD;
"I do feel sorry for her. But what can~ be done for&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"I don't know," I answered, pondering. "It is so hard&#xD;
that she should be held in chains' of degradation, when her&#xD;
better self has repudiated her wrong act." After a few mo-&#xD;
ments a bright thought came.&#xD;
"I am going to write to her, Miss Baldwin."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
This simple word, very coolly put, suddenly brought me&#xD;
down to a very modest estimate of my powers as a comforter&#xD;
to Miss Hartly,-but it did not check my eager impulse.&#xD;
"Oh, because she is so lonely-1-I want h~r to know that&#xD;
there is a distant heart that knows her story, and blesses her,&#xD;
and hopes for her."&#xD;
I started to write my letter. "Kate!" called Miss Bald-&#xD;
win, "you may tell her I forgive her." I looked back, and&#xD;
saw with joy that a momentary sunlight gleamed over Miss&#xD;
Baldwin's stern, melancholy face. I felt that the dawn was&#xD;
breaking over her spirit. I wrote and dispatched the letter,&#xD;
crc the sun went quite below the distant tree tops. I direct-&#xD;
ed it to the assumed name Miss Ifartly had taken.&#xD;
It was not two weeks before an answer caine; it contained&#xD;
but few words, and made no parade of her temptations, youth,&#xD;
and repentance. It only said-&#xD;

"Oh ! I thank you from my heart for your letter. My&#xD;
soul was :fainting for encouragement. I was -perishing for&#xD;
lack of kindness. I know that I did not deserve it, but I&#xD;
will leave the past to my Redeemer, and hope in God and&#xD;

Poor child! How many jewelled, hands would smite&#xD;
thee back, albeit the hands, belonged to hearts no better.&#xD;
How many strong arms that should prove a protection, would&#xD;
lead thee to more hopeless ruin. A few days after the re-&#xD;
ceipt of this letter, and while my heart was yet turning to&#xD;
the writer with vague~ projects for bettering her condition, I&#xD;
was startled from my thoughtful mood, by a thundering&#xD;
knock at the front door. One of the servants went to give&#xD;
the knocker admittance, but he did not choose to come mn.&#xD;
For a half hour he paced with impetuous tread the piazza.&#xD;
I stepped into the ball as Bess was passing through, and&#xD;
asked, .&#xD;
"Who is that man, Bess, and why does he walk the&#xD;
piazza so ?"&#xD;
She. shook her head, and said he had inquired for Mr.&#xD;
Henry, who had not returned from the city. I went out on&#xD;
the upper piazza, and with commendable curiosity, leaned&#xD;
over, and tried to catch a glimpse of the impassioned stran-&#xD;
ger. But I could not. At th3 same moment Mr. Henry&#xD;
rode to the gate, and dismounted from his horse. The&#xD;
stranger rushed down the steps, and met him in the broad&#xD;
stone walk.&#xD;
" Do I speak to Mr. Henry ?" he demanded.&#xD;
Mr. Henry bowed in his courteous manner, but kept an&#xD;
eye of surprise on the young mat.&#xD;
" Then? sir,"~ said the latter with quiet fierceness, " either&#xD;

He handed Mr. Henry a pistol: a growing paleness&#xD;
overspread the Southerner's face, as he asked, " Who are&#xD;
you, sir ?"&#xD;
" An honest man confrontinig a villain ! I am the aven-&#xD;
ger of a sister's wrongs!&#xD;
The stranger turned his face a moment to, the declining&#xD;
sun, as if to look his last. Gracious Heaven ! it was Wal-&#xD;
ter Gray !&#xD;
" Where shall we go ?" I heard his impatient lips utter.&#xD;
It all flashed upon me in a moment. Miss Hartly was the&#xD;
half sister he had sometimes talked'to me about. I entered&#xD;
the hall, bounded down the stairs, and stood by him, with&#xD;
my hand on- his arm, my lips refusing to speak. His face&#xD;
was deadly white. He lifted his hand to his forehead, and&#xD;
dreamingly said,-&#xD;
" Kate ! am I in a dream ?" His eyes had a bewildered&#xD;
look.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, it is a dream," I answered, takin from his hand&#xD;
thet11hI pistol lie held. I flung it quickly at a distance, for I&#xD;
was afraid to hold it. M ~y -appearance soon explained itself&#xD;
to him, when he remnembered that he had heard I was teach-&#xD;
ing at the South.&#xD;
"You must leave us, Kate," he said, with a compression&#xD;
of his lips.&#xD;
Mr. Henry will wait five minutes, I said.&#xD;
"Tere is no danger of my absconding, sir !" Mr. Henry&#xD;
exclaimed, as the hot, haughty blood mounted to his fore-&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"I must speak with you, Walter : it may be the last,&#xD;
time,"  said. I placed my hand within his arm, and led&#xD;
him unwillingly away. I spoke rapidly :&#xD;

der him the evil will not stop there. lie has a lovely wife;&#xD;
she has lost her reason,. but within a few weeks we have seen&#xD;
a slight improvenwnt. A sudden shock might render her a&#xD;
confirmed lunatic. Your vengeance would not strike the&#xD;
innocent, would it'?"&#xD;
It is a righteous thing," he responded, ' for a man to&#xD;
avenge a sister's wrongs, when the law fails to do it. Only&#xD;
a fiend in human shape could haye corrnptecl her."&#xD;
"I received a letter from her, Walter, a few days ago?"&#xD;
" Ah !&#xD;
"Did she write to you?"&#xD;
"Yes," he replied, "after a silence of months. She told&#xD;
me she was rui]ied, and by whom."&#xD;
"But; Walter, you will do her an irreparable injury by&#xD;
making a noise about it."&#xD;
"How can she be injured farther? Her good name is&#xD;
gone, and I can neither eat nor sleep until "-&#xD;
"hush! her shame is not known in this neighborhood.&#xD;
She left it long ago, and she bears an assumed name in a lit-&#xD;
tie village in Virginia. She is a stranger in il3o ston, and as&#xD;
your sister will be respected and beloved. Take her to&#xD;
Cousin Mary's to board. I will never reveal the secret to&#xD;
any member of the family."&#xD;
"Could it be done?" asked Walter, as hope gleamed in&#xD;
his eye.&#xD;
"Certainly; nothing i~ easier. There i~ no justice in&#xD;
condemning a woman to lasting infamy, when a man woald&#xD;
not be cast fi~om~ society for the same thing. She shall be lny&#xD;
sister~ as well as yours, Walter."&#xD;
lie was silent a very long time. We walked slowly&#xD;
along away from the house, and towards the woods. At&#xD;
length he said, " Thank yogi, dear Kate. That villain es-&#xD;
capes-it is only for her sake." his rigid lips and the con-&#xD;

coinplished, I became aware of the fright and shock I had&#xD;
sustained. Ii leaned against a tree until I had recovered&#xD;
myself; then we resu~nccl the conversation.&#xD;
Where is shc, Kate'?" demanded Walter. "Her let-&#xD;
ter was post-marked Washington: it is evidently her design&#xD;
not to let inc find her out a~ present."&#xD;
"Perhaps she feared you could not forgive her at first.&#xD;
Shall you go to see her?"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly. My property fell to me through my&#xD;
father's relatives, therefore Effie would be no better off if I&#xD;
did not share my fortune with her. Before I went to Eu-&#xD;
rope I deposited a sum in bank for her: she has never&#xD;
called for it ; most probably she has known nothing about it,&#xD;
for she was wandering about that time, and all trace of her&#xD;
was lost."&#xD;
i[ explained to Walter where his sister was, and added,&#xD;
Oh how I wish I could go with you to see her.'~&#xD;
I Viii you, Kate?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"Would you venture back alone?" he questioned.&#xD;
Yes, indeed."&#xD;
Go with mc in the morning, then. I will meet you&#xD;
with a carriage by that tree in the road. Do you see it?"&#xD;
* "That tree so far from the house, where the road begins&#xD;
to turn '? "&#xD;
Yes, right there. At seven o'clock."&#xD;
"Agreed. Shall I be absent more than three days?" I&#xD;
asked, beginning to think Miss Baldwin would consider me&#xD;
a very ridiculous girl.&#xD;
"Not more than three days, I think. Ii am so glad you&#xD;
are going with me, Kate," Walter said, with something 9f&#xD;
his old cordial manner. After our~plans had been discussed&#xD;
thoroughly, Walter went away, and I turned towards the&#xD;

TILE -JOURNEY.&#xD;

Louse with a kind -of terrible feeling, for it devolved upon&#xD;
me to tell Mr. Henry that the duel, was not to come off.&#xD;
IHe sat alone in the porch ; 'his dark eyes, set teeth, and pale&#xD;
countenance showed his excitement.&#xD;
"Miss Hartly's brother will not see you. again," I said,&#xD;
hastening up the steps, and gliding into the house as quickly&#xD;
as possible.. If I had stopped one mizoment, I felt as if Mr.&#xD;
Henry's look of fierce passion would have transfixed me.&#xD;
" Come back !" he briefly commanded.&#xD;
I obey~ed, and stood in the door-way.&#xD;
"Whiat 'does that young man intend to do ?" he. asked,&#xD;
without looking at me.&#xD;
"Nothing! "&#xD;
" Nothing.? What do you mean ?"&#xD;
" I mean what I say. He is going away to-morrow," I&#xD;
replied-.&#xD;
" Does the matter stop there ?" He fixed his dark, keen&#xD;
&#xD;
gaze upon me-.&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
He still looked at me, as if he desired I should expl&#xD;
'the causes which had operated with Walter. I said no&#xD;
mug.&#xD;
" Perhaps," suggested Mr. Henry, " he wishes it sett&#xD;
in a business way. ~&#xD;
" Withr money ?" I asked, unable to repress a scorn&#xD;

in&#xD;

"Yes," he answered.&#xD;
I turned, away with a disdainful smile, and went in the&#xD;
house. " To weigh immortal souls, 'and life-agonies, and re-&#xD;
pentance, and all that is of moment, against mioney / I&#xD;
went to my room, and thought what a variety in my quiet&#xD;

HIenry had given me. I hated unnecessary baggage. While&#xD;
I was thinking what a romantic little adventure I was soon&#xD;
to have, Miss Baldwin came in.&#xD;
"'Whiy, Kate !" she exclaimed, looking on the bed where&#xD;
my things were spread out.&#xD;
-" Why, Miss' Baldwin, that stranger is Miss Hartly's&#xD;
brother, and the very Walter you have' heard me speak of.&#xD;
I ami going with him to-morrow to see Eflie. Is that right? "&#xD;
" You must do as you think best, of course," she re-&#xD;
plied " but--what are you going for ? What is the use?"&#xD;
" Oh, I want to go. I don't know what the use is."&#xD;
We sat down, and had one of our nice long talks. I&#xD;
told her why Walter had .come to see Mr. Henry. Miss&#xD;
Baldwin seemed more like her old, cheerful self than I had&#xD;
seen her in a long time.&#xD;
In the morning I bade the children " Good-bye " very&#xD;
quietly, and with my pretty little basket strolledl down the&#xD;
road, where I found Walter and the carriage waiting.. It&#xD;
was'a delicious morning, and I was so happy that I came&#xD;
very near being quite gay when I met Walter's glance,&#xD;
which was kind but very grave. There was such an exult-&#xD;
ing sense of freedom in getting away from my cares, and in&#xD;
stepping forth into new scenes. Walter had sad experiences&#xD;
to tell of theaheartlessness which he had found in the world.&#xD;
We talked very feelingly upon this subject, until we had&#xD;
passed off 'some of the unpleasant smoke of life in this way,&#xD;
then we'rallied and ventured upon a little melancholy satire&#xD;
relative to the miseries of humanity. After this we went a&#xD;
little farther, and gradually began to take a different view.&#xD;
The comic side presented itself, and Walter's old, merry&#xD;
peals of laughter joined mine, until the forests echoed them.&#xD;
II was glad to see this reaction of feeling in him.&#xD;
But our journey came to its end. We had reached by&#xD;

THE PAST IS FOItOOTWEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
of the meeting came &amp;amp;ver us-the remembrance of the suf-&#xD;
ferings of the erring one. We left the cars and wandered&#xD;
about in search of the hou~e where Mrs. Williams lived;&#xD;
by this name, Effie was' known. After patient scaich we&#xD;
found the desired dwelling; the frqnt door stood open;&#xD;
we knocked, and as. no one caine, we entered the hall; we&#xD;
tapped lightly at the next door: Ii coilild iica~ Walter's&#xD;
agitated breathing. As no one opened the door, we entered;&#xD;
it was a plain, dreary room, with a rag eaf~pet a~~d wooden&#xD;
chairs. A young girl sat on a low seat; her graceful head&#xD;
had dropped upon a chair; she looked tired, and she was&#xD;
fast asleep. The sun shone upon her small head, and light&#xD;
brown, waving h'air, whidh was plainly parted, and gathered&#xD;
in a braid at the back. The pale, lovely flee was the same&#xD;
which had looked at me from the miniature; but the then&#xD;
smiling lips were closed in weariness and melancholy. She&#xD;
wore a coarse, dark calico dress, fitting exquisitely, and&#xD;
finished off at the throat with a little white collar. Walter&#xD;
looked, at her a moment and burst into an agony of tears,-&#xD;
he hastily quitted the room. The sleeper awoke. She&#xD;
started on seeing a str~ug6r, and askecLalmost timidly, "Do&#xD;
you wish to ~ee Mrs. 4llen?"&#xD;
"No!" I said ;"i~[ am a friend of yours, Ethic. I am&#xD;
Kate Hamilton." I put my arm aroundd her, and kissed her.&#xD;
Her pale face flushed, and tears gathered iii her eyes. Wal-&#xD;
ter entered. She clasped her hands with a start,, and then&#xD;
covered her face with theni, sinking in a chair, and lowering&#xD;
her head to her bosom, in an attitude of intensest shame.&#xD;
Walter gently raised the bowed head, kissed her forehead;&#xD;
kissed the dropping eyes from ~hieh the tears rained; kissed&#xD;
the trembling lips.&#xD;
"Thile, the past is to be forgotten!" he whispered.&#xD;
I could have knelt, and kissed his hand, but puly cried&#xD;
with all my heart.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Allen, a good-natured, but coarse woman, allowed&#xD;
us to make a hotel of her house, for the night. What a&#xD;
contraSb between mistress and servant: the former was the.&#xD;
thrifty wife of a* quondam New England farmer: her one&#xD;
idea was housework; Eflie's slender hands, red and chopped,&#xD;
showed what her duties had teen. When she took a pail to&#xD;
go out and milk, at Mi~s. Allen's request, Walter blushed&#xD;
painfully.&#xD;
I slept with Efhie that night. It was late before 'we had&#xD;
packed up her wardrobe for tier northward journey on the&#xD;
morrow; and when we sought our plows, we could not&#xD;
sleep from exeitenfent.&#xD;
" Oh!" sighed Effie, "if my unhappy history should&#xD;
ever be discovered! Poor Walter! Such a brother do-&#xD;
serves a sister whom h~ might b~ proud of."&#xD;
"Jfe may learn to be proud of you," I said, in reply.&#xD;
"Look forward rather than backward. I do not think your&#xD;
mnisfortun~ will ever become known; if it should, he will&#xD;
he among those who will love you 'for what you are, rather&#xD;
than for what you have been."&#xD;
"I have always looked to others~ she said, "and leaned&#xD;
on others: the breath of approbation was my life. The fear&#xD;
that my secret will be discovered, will always hang over inc&#xD;
like a drawn sword, robbing me of all pleasure, even when~ I&#xD;
am commended. Perhaps4 it will teach me to look for God's&#xD;
approbation, knowing that a breath can change the estimate&#xD;
in which human beings hold inc."~&#xD;
" Eflie, when you learn the hearts of Cousin Mary and&#xD;
O race, you ~an tell them your history, if fear 4iil hangs&#xD;
over you. If people were true in judgment, we might soon&#xD;
learn to possess frankness. As society is constituted, it is&#xD;
often best to withhold the truth, when we would not deny it.'~&#xD;

&#xD;
"Well, indeed!"&#xD;
Mrs. Allen was 'up, and bustling about the house, before&#xD;
we had closed 6ur eyes. ,Effie got up, and dressed, and 1&#xD;
dropped away into the most delicious slumber, realizing how&#xD;
great the privilege was, by constantly dreaming I ought to&#xD;
get up; reiterating a vision of the process of dressing, until&#xD;
I saw myself before the little glass, with every rebellious&#xD;
hair adjusted to its place, my linen collar laid down smooth-&#xD;
ly, my gloves on, etc.&#xD;
"Come, Kate," sounded an unknown voice. It was that&#xD;
of Effie; and to my despair, I discovered that my neatness&#xD;
and energy were mere illusions.&#xD;
Mrs. Allen was exccedin~ly loth to part with her "help."&#xD;
We all went to the same dep~ot. Walter placed me on board&#xD;
the 'cars, and then ran to bri4g Eflie to bid .me " Good-bye,"&#xD;
but as usual the cars started off, before they could reach us.&#xD;
I caught a glimpse of their l~audsoine faces, and saw Effie's&#xD;
white handkerchief wave until they were lost from sight.&#xD;
For an hour, Ii was all attention to what was going on in&#xD;
the cars: the passengers were possessed of varied physiog-&#xD;
nomies, and I attached a history or prophecy to ~acli face.&#xD;
The scenery was wild an4 glorious; but very soon fatigue&#xD;
and sleep came overpoweringly, arid the journey was cam-&#xD;
pleted under a double green veil.&#xD;
When I reached home, Minnie met me first. I saw with&#xD;
delight that she greeted me in her old, sweet, affectionate man-&#xD;
ner. iDear Minnie! she was destined to come back to us&#xD;
yet. Miss Baldwin seemed quite cheerful. When Minnie&#xD;
was away, I said, "How fast she improves!"&#xD;
"Do you see it?" asked Miss Baldwin, with a smile full&#xD;
of hope. "The doctor says we need have no fears now, if we&#xD;
are careful of her health."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
IT was through a pietum~e gallery in Florence, that Giovanni&#xD;
Benzoni wandered; sometinws sitting down, and holding his&#xD;
head between his hands in very weariness, and again moving&#xD;
about, and studying~ a picture with a true jitalian's love of&#xD;
art. It 'was a great, silent gallery, and rarely entered by&#xD;
new visitors. ft seemed like a cold, well appointed chamber&#xD;
of tho intellect, filled with fair images, yet unWarmed and&#xD;
unlighted by the heart. A strange sense of isolation came&#xD;
upon the homeless man, as he gazed upon a picture, repre-&#xD;
senting a peasant and wife, with an infant child of great&#xD;
beauty. The wife wz~s looking up in the eyes of her brawny&#xD;
husband, with a childlike, love and pride. Benzoni sighed,&#xD;
and thought of the heavy hour when he clasped his babe to&#xD;
his heart for the last time: he thought of the kneeling, ago-&#xD;
nized Judith, and wondered if he had not wronged her. He&#xD;
turned away from viewing the picture; his eye fell upon a&#xD;
group at a distanceand thenwasspell-bound to oneface! a&#xD;
face glorious in beauty, pale and proud though it was: the&#xD;
great, himinous eyes were riveted upon him calmly, yet in&#xD;
their quietness, they glowed and flashed. The full, haughty&#xD;
lip did not qm~iver; the stately presence did not droop; the&#xD;
great eyes did not remove their gaze, until Benzoni turned&#xD;
away from their powerful magnetism. And he watched that&#xD;

&#xD;
queenly form, and caught every cold smile that flashed over&#xD;
that lip,-and he marked with wonder the superb bearing&#xD;
that woh an almost reverential worship from the two gifted&#xD;
men near her; men whom lie had known and honored : he'&#xD;
saw the gentlefaces of women turned to her with friendship.&#xD;
She was the cynosure of every new visitor's eye. It wa~&#xD;
not alone her beauty, but the fascination of manner, lo oh,&#xD;
and smile: exquisitely' cultivated they had been. 11cr voice&#xD;
even fell upon the husband's ear~ laden with 'choicest words;&#xD;
with the "honey of persuasion," for she was winning one at&#xD;
her side to think with her; her seducing tones were niodu~&#xD;
lated to sink into ]3enzoni's listening heart, to waken old&#xD;
feelings, to create intense longings. And yet never while&#xD;
there did her eyes fall up6n her husband; the slight color had&#xD;
returned to 'her cheek ; almost the haughtiness had incIted&#xD;
into grace and sweetness. The party left the gallery; Ben-&#xD;
zoni, followed at a distance, and marked the dwelling which&#xD;
his Wife entered in company with her friends.&#xD;
At evening there was a masqneradq ball, to which Ben-&#xD;
(2&#xD;
zoni was invited, lie went, hoping to see Judith. She&#xD;
came, magnificently robed in velvet 'and jewels; but the&#xD;
wore no mask, and when he spoke to her from beneath his,&#xD;
she retreated without reply among her friends, the former&#xD;
proud cahniiess sitting on her lip. There was no agitation,&#xD;
no embarrassment, no excitement evident in her manner, and&#xD;
yet her heart thrilled aymd' heav6d with an emotion that&#xD;
seemed overmastering. Pride is a mighty comYtroller of the&#xD;
leaping pulse.&#xD;
Judith wa~ visiting friends in Florence. She had brought&#xD;
isa with her. To every proposal to visit places of art she&#xD;
lent a willing ear, for she thirsted to meet her husband,-to&#xD;
meet him with proud indifference. henceforth she took isa&#xD;
with her, and she saw with a strange thrill the look which&#xD;
the father bestowed upon the child, and the cutrcating pas-'&#xD;
&#xD;
sion in his eyes, as he turned again to her. Judith felt that&#xD;
she was again beloved, uot alone as the mother of his child,&#xD;
but as a beautiful and gifted treasure in herself. But with&#xD;
this conviction, the cold ness of her face deepened, arid she&#xD;
avoided with double art any proximity to her husband.&#xD;
Thus weeks passed on, and she had not spoken to him.&#xD;
*                      *      *&#xD;
She sat by the window which overlooked the garde and&#xD;
the distant Tiber. She ~at within her home, and Isa's arms&#xD;
clung about her neck, while rushing thoughts swept athwart&#xD;
her l)rain, until her heart waved to and fro, now melting&#xD;
into love, now steeling itself into pride. The door opened,&#xD;
and her husband stood before her; he gazed upon the pic-&#xD;
ture, and held out his arms to the child. She went to him;&#xD;
Judith did not seek to prevent her, but Isa shrunk from his&#xD;
passionate caresses, and fled from the room. Meantime Ju-&#xD;
dith sa~ unmoved, save that her haughty eye asked the&#xD;
meaning of the intrusion. The last time he ha1l been in&#xD;
that room, swept before her: her kneeling, creeping, clinging&#xD;
figure. He dared not speak as he read the language of tkvt&#xD;
eye: lie knelt before her with pale, unmoving lips. She&#xD;
rose. lie lightly, reverently touched her dress: he had&#xD;
grown more liunible since he had learned how hard a thing&#xD;
it is to win back an outraged love.&#xD;
" Judith ! "&#xD;
11cr cQld, icy tones broke the stillness in reply.&#xD;
"This house is yours! I can seek another. .iLTy home&#xD;
must be free from'your presence."&#xD;
" Judith !&#xD;
"Enough!" she uttered. "I go from here!"&#xD;
She turned from him.&#xD;
Stay!" he entreated, rising to his feet, yet unable to&#xD;
control his agitation.&#xD;
11cr intensely pale, proud face tui~ncd towards him-her&#xD;

&#xD;
lips were closed with the determination of a mighty will-&#xD;
her glowing, yet steadfast eyes demanded his business. It&#xD;
was fearful to behold that calm face; calm from the profound&#xD;
excitement that held her whole being at a pause.&#xD;
"I believe you innocent," came with difficulty from the&#xD;
lips of her husband.&#xD;
Madame Benzoni bowed very slightly-very coldly, with&#xD;
no change of expression or attitude. She had every 4ay&#xD;
expected a communication like this. Her eyes still seemed&#xD;
to demand his right to intrude upon her.&#xD;
"Oh, Judith! Judith ! "-the tones were very low, with&#xD;
passionatq appcaling---with anguish.&#xD;
She, waved her hand with a haughty gesture for him to&#xD;
stop-she could not speak for a moment; then she said, "I&#xD;
will leave here to-morrow."&#xD;
Benzoni saw no relenting in her sternly, beautiful coun-&#xD;
tenance.&#xD;
"This hQme is sacred to you!" he said. "Farewell-&#xD;
Judith.-~-wife "-and he left her.&#xD;
When he was lost to her sight, she put forth her hand&#xD;
feebly, as if it were dark: she slightly grasped the heayy&#xD;
mahogany chair in whiuh she had been sitting-then her&#xD;
hold relaxed-she sunk insensible upon the floor.&#xD;
Benzoni wandered away, into the country, and when he&#xD;
bccai~ie ~weary, he sat down in the evening sunshine a very&#xD;
de~ol~te man. He knew not what to do with his life-with&#xD;
his stalwart manhood.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
TILE spring winds were blowing around Miss Cardovei"s&#xD;
house with a dreary sound. It was early in the evening, but&#xD;
Pliny Cardover had retired to his room. He sat by a table,&#xD;
and had ceased writing, with his suspended pen uplifted and&#xD;
his thoughtful glance bent on the low fire that glimmered, in&#xD;
the grate.&#xD;
"It does seem like a desolate world," he mused, "when-&#xD;
ever I allow my thoughts to centre upon my own position in it.&#xD;
I have made missteps and mistakes, and the little golden ore&#xD;
I have obtained, has been through rugged difficulties. I&#xD;
poured out the holiest love of my being at a beautiful shrine&#xD;
.~-and I learned that the idol which it held was not such an&#xD;
one as I had believed-it was another's. And so that first&#xD;
vision of exquisite happiness died out That was well. I&#xD;
became thankful that my mistake was discovered to me-I&#xD;
did not wish to l~ve a beautiful creation of my soul-I&#xD;
wished to love a real being who possessed in herself all the&#xD;
sweetnesses I yearned to see in women. , And-yes! I thought&#xD;
I had found such an one, and love arose again, more omnipo-&#xD;
tent than before. I saw-I knew it-I saw such an inward&#xD;
natijire as could hav&amp;amp;riveted my heart for ever. Strange!&#xD;
she seemed so to confide in me, so to trust in me, and yet&#xD;

&#xD;
is it that Horace Waidron should be ~o fortunate? why&#xD;
must I live this cold, stony life? Ah I foolishness! I must&#xD;
not think of this I '~' Mr. Cardover ran his hand through his&#xD;
dark hair, and then turned his eyes upon his letter: he wrote&#xD;
a few words, and paused ~gain, musing,--" Horace is of a'&#xD;
different genius from myself,-there is a sort of celestial&#xD;
purity about him which I lack. ]l need his faith, his world-&#xD;
embracing love. I am too abrupt, too unyielding, too unwilling&#xD;
to pour out my life-efforts for humanity; and for this perchance&#xD;
I am debarred individual happiness, Well! I will give up&#xD;
seeking for that which I cannot obtain. I will turn to my&#xD;
cold existence with more content, if I can, and win from its&#xD;
sterility some imperishable profit. I n~ust cease to think of&#xD;
her, if I would labor diligently in the present. ii must resolve&#xD;
to await destiny with more patience." Pliny Cardovei:'s&#xD;
thoughts were broken inupon by a familiar rap.&#xD;
"Come in!" he briefly said, and Mr. Waldron entered,&#xD;
bringing with him a fresh atmosphere.&#xD;
"Sit down, Horace," Mr. Cardover said, handing him a&#xD;
chair. "It is chilly out of doors, is it not?"&#xD;
"II had not noticed. The weather makes little impression&#xD;
on me," ~answered Mr. Waldron. His pale, handsome&#xD;
countenance had acquired of late a look of interior bright-&#xD;
nes~, as if some great joy dwelt in the centre of his being-&#xD;
strangers might not have Poticed it, but his deep, tranqutl&#xD;
eyes shone with a new lustre, as if a mist had beeu dispelled&#xD;
from the hidden soul. Pliny had noticed this for months, ~&#xD;
and had divined its cause, although no words had passed&#xD;
between the friends relative to its cause; and yet they had&#xD;
been companions from childhood.&#xD;
Do I&#xD;
~ is disturb you, Pliny? you were writing."&#xD;
'of no consequence," returned Mr. Cardover, push-&#xD;
ing back his writing materials, and drawing his chair nearer&#xD;
the fire, as he replenished it. After this was done, he looked&#xD;
&#xD;
at his frieuid, and abruptly said, "You and Grace love each&#xD;
othe , horace?"&#xD;
r. Waldron bowod, and a flush rose to his white fore-&#xD;
head he had not yet ceased to thrill strangely at the mention&#xD;
of l~ r b4oved name. "I should have told you long before,&#xD;
Phin r," he said, " but-"&#xD;
"I understand-your, emotions were too sacred to be men-&#xD;
tion4l to cars profane ;" a half sad, half bitter smile was on&#xD;
Mr. ~J ardover's lip as he said this.&#xD;
"When you are undergoing like experiences, Pliny, I&#xD;
shall~be able to be more communicative." Mr. Waldron 's&#xD;
smile was of a different character.&#xD;
It was time now for the hasty color to mount the brow&#xD;
of the host. "When shall you be married ?" he asked,&#xD;
stirring the fire, as if to prevent the conversation from becom-&#xD;
kig low and confidential.&#xD;
'Kiln the autumn: soon after Grace's cousin returns from&#xD;
the South. She is to be bridesmaid-and while I think of&#xD;
it, Pliny, ]l will secure your services as groomsman, if you do&#xD;
not object."&#xD;
"No! certainlyy not;" responded Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"I was rather disappointed, Pliny, that you did not take&#xD;
a fancy to that little Kate hamilton last summer."&#xD;
"Were you?" said Mr. Cardover gloomily.&#xD;
"Yes, because II think she would make you an excellent&#xD;
wile."&#xD;
"When other people judge for us, they often make a~&#xD;
great mistakes as we do in choosing for ourselves," Mr. Car-&#xD;
dover said a little impatiently. ". I shall live a bachelor."&#xD;
I' Nonsense! II do not bchi~ve it."&#xD;
"And yet you know me well enough, Horace, to be&#xD;
assured that I will not marry, unless I believe I have found&#xD;
one who is entirely suited to me-and then such an one may&#xD;

Mr. Waidron observed that his friend was not in a&#xD;
jesting humor :-he wished that he understood the current&#xD;
of his thoughts, but he was entirely ignorant of their direc-&#xD;
tion. He wished that he could pour into his cold spirit the&#xD;
rich light in which he himself lived, but he could not do this,&#xD;
and he left him.                                                                      CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;

to feel a true interest, in me, and to him I frankly confided&#xD;
thoughts and feelings which Ii had never breathed to others.&#xD;
He offered me his heart. Oh! I loved with the pent-up&#xD;
feeling of years,-beyond all power of expression. I adored&#xD;
him with a grateful worship, for he had taught inc that I was&#xD;
not to be cast away from every heart, as unlovely, and un-&#xD;
worthy of love. I learned the beautiful capacities of my&#xD;
nature, and drank from an overflowing bowl. II told him of&#xD;
my wealth.~ Thcre was no elation in his look: even his&#xD;
eolo~ did not change. I esteemed him more than e~er for&#xD;
this indifference to the money-god. 116 begged that we,&#xD;
should be married soon. We went to my father's Kb oi~ie.&#xD;
Gerald was adinii~cd and loved. My parents were glad of&#xD;
my happiness. In a week after my father had seen my lover,&#xD;
we were married. My husband wrote to a friend, wI o&#xD;
furnished a handsome c6untry-hous~ for us. My father&#xD;
settled upon ~ie the property coining to me, and with our&#xD;
whole family, we journeyed to 'Washington; 'thence we went&#xD;
to our country Paradise. That happy month Ii shall never&#xD;
forget; yet I half~ desired the time to conic, when Gerald&#xD;
and I should be alone. He was utterly devoted to inc. At&#xD;
last fimrewells were said, blessings were pronounced, and we&#xD;
were quite alone. A few days ~ftcr, Gerald came in with a&#xD;
clouded brow. I took a seat, by him on the sofa, and laid&#xD;
my head on his shoulder, saying, 'What is it'?'&#xD;
"lIe slightly moved away from me, and then, rose and&#xD;
walked the floor. That slight movement of repulsion, the&#xD;
raising of his hand to bid me remove my head, went to my&#xD;
heart with inexpressible sharpness. It recalled the pang&#xD;
that had been nay companion for so many years.&#xD;
"'I must leave you for a couple of days; Adelaide,' he&#xD;
suddenly exclaimed. He hurriedly kisses me, and left. I&#xD;
did not ask any questions, for my first one was unanswered.&#xD;
I sunk down on the sofa with a sad heart; I feared he was&#xD;
&#xD;
A SORROWING HEART.              309&#xD;
1'&#xD;
beginning to grow tired of me. I knew that I had no win-&#xD;
ning ways,-that my manner was repulsive rather, but I&#xD;
drove away the clouds that hovered about mc, and resolved&#xD;
that our home should be all brightness when he caine back.&#xD;
The afternoon I expected him, I[ filled the house with the&#xD;
fragrance of flowers. I wore them in my hair, and in my&#xD;
bosom; a bouquet graced the little workstand where I[ sewed.&#xD;
But evening closed in, and he did not come. My flowers all&#xD;
withered and lie did not come. He never came. Kate! he&#xD;
had a wife and children living in England. lIe haa learned&#xD;
in some w~y that I was rich before he saw me. lie went&#xD;
from this country with my property. I have never known&#xD;
any thing of him since. My father endeavored to trace him,&#xD;
but in ~ain. He left me with' the pang of being unloved in&#xD;
my soul, burned in ~vith fire, as it had never been before. I&#xD;
went to my father's house again. Minnie became my idol;&#xD;
when she married, I caine to live with her. I have passed&#xD;
many years in rebellion and conflict-I have madly doubted&#xD;
and despaived of any brightness~ of aay deep, satisfying&#xD;
peace. But I begin to feel as if it is morning yet, the morn-&#xD;
ing of existence-I begin to hope that Ii have not suffered as&#xD;
vainly as I thought I had. I hope for a fresh dayspring;&#xD;
I almost see iL breaking.~~&#xD;
Ifere Minnie broke in. upon us with the children. Reason&#xD;
had entirely returned to her, and the faint rose on her cheek&#xD;
betokened a degree of physical health which she had not&#xD;
enjoyed in years.&#xD;
"Oh, Kate! how I d+ead to have you leave us," Mrs.&#xD;
Henry said. Ii rose and put my arm around her, as Ii had&#xD;
long been acenstorned to do in her convalescence; we walked&#xD;
away from the arbor. Minnie raised her blue eyes and said,&#xD;
"You will leave mc a happier and better woman than you&#xD;
found me. I do not feel myself a blighted human flower&#xD;
now. My sorrow will not kill me, crush me, as it has done.&#xD;

310              BEAUTY FOR ASHES.&#xD;
&#xD;
El&#xD;
&#xD;
II shall feel, notwithstanding it, that I am one of God's bright&#xD;
children~ and that lie will in his own time give inc 'beauty&#xD;
for ashes.'"&#xD;
That darling Minnie! her sweet meekness penetrated tQ&#xD;
my heart: I clasped her close within my arms, kissing her&#xD;
with fast falling tears. Slowly the drops rose in her clear&#xD;
eyes, but she smiled and said,&#xD;
"I don't feel now that I am one to be pitied, because a&#xD;
brightness is shining through my lot, and hope is lifting the&#xD;
cross from my heart.&#xD;
After te~, Minnie said to me in her gentle, appealing way,&#xD;
"Shall I\ spend an hour with the children, Kate? I'll&#xD;
hear you rea~I to them."&#xD;
"No; yoijt take my place, Mrs. Henry," I answered. "It&#xD;
will do your heart good to read and talk with them. They&#xD;
ask so many earnest, beautiful questions. I always feel as if&#xD;
I had drained some health-giving elixir, after the hour in&#xD;
the nursery. I must write this evening."&#xD;
Mrs. Henry took her little flock up stairs. During her&#xD;
aberration she had been in the habit of going to the nursery&#xD;
with us, whei~ we read: she would always curl down at my&#xD;
feet, and listen like a child. I did not wish to go with her&#xD;
now, for I thought she might feel like talking with the chil-&#xD;
dren, and I feared I might be a restraint. Then I felt that&#xD;
it would do her actual good to fulfil the duty. The nursery&#xD;
was opposite the school-room; when I sought the latter, I&#xD;
looked in passing, into the children's roo~u. The eveniiig&#xD;
was warm, and the doors were open. Freddie in his snowy&#xD;
night-dress, sat in his mother's .Iap, leaning his curly head&#xD;
against her bosom; his bright eyes were full of interest.&#xD;
Nellie sat with Jessie on a low seat, looking up with soft'&#xD;
earnest eyes. After I was seated to write, Minnie's low,&#xD;
sweet tones were borne to my ear,-then the evening prayer,&#xD;
-then words of loving encouragement.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
TuE last day before my departure~ North was waning,-~had&#xD;
waned. The still influences of the night jwere upon me. I&#xD;
was alone once more with the In~1nite, and I prayed, "Oh,&#xD;
Father! h~y thy hand upon me ith a blessing, and bend&#xD;
me to the duties of my lot. I thirst for a diviner air to&#xD;
bathe my spirit in. Teach me to cast the past behind me,&#xD;
with its sorrowful weaknesses, its resentments~ its selfishness.&#xD;
I tremble lest my heart may be shaken with keener woe&#xD;
than ever. Oh, take me to thine rms of love, hold me there&#xD;
when the terrible, angry blasts o life almost kill me. If I&#xD;
must drink a sorrowful cup, do T ou help m~ to drain it!"&#xD;
My nightly~ prayer was' done, and yet I could not rest.&#xD;
The unknown future seemed r shing towards me with a&#xD;
mighty tread, and I could not ~tay it. Bright, or dark?&#xD;
There the curtain fell. Perchance I might come back.&#xD;
With half fearful, half hopeful eye, I turned toward a life&#xD;
at Cousin Mary's.&#xD;
At daybreak the children came running to my room with&#xD;
little presents, with kisses, tears and clasping arms-and I&#xD;
blessed and kissed them with a yearning heart. I feared I&#xD;
might be forsaking my Master's vineyard if I did not come&#xD;
back, and yet I would not be bound by any promise. Break-&#xD;
fast over, we gathered on the great front porch. The chil-&#xD;
dren were to ride with me as far as the railroad depot.&#xD;

need his care. IL was at length safely stowed in a carriage,&#xD;
and went rumbling through the familiar streets, which were&#xD;
flooded with afternoon sunshine. IL looked with eager eyes&#xD;
at the passers-by, wondering if among the many, IL should&#xD;
see the face of a friend. Suddenly, like a vision, the face&#xD;
which was uppermost in my thoughts camie in 'sight. Mr.&#xD;
Cardover came out of a bookstore. I drew back instantly,&#xD;

with a rushing in my heart, that convinced meT had gained&#xD;
littk by a year's absence. It seemed to me that the beloved&#xD;
face had grown more spiritual, more noble than ever. He&#xD;
looked casually iiito the carriage, t~nd saw me. A brilliant&#xD;
smile of surprise and recog~u±uii passed over his counte-&#xD;
nance. IL bowed in return. The carriage rolled' on and&#xD;
brought me to the dear old house. My trunk was placed&#xD;
on the steps, the coachman whirled away, and yet I stood&#xD;
wondering whether they were all well, IL leaned 'over, and.&#xD;
looked jn the parlor window, whence came sounds of morn-&#xD;
I             mont arjd music. Walter stood laughing by Lilly Cardovor,&#xD;
&#xD;
teaching her to play on the flute. Gertrude stood in front&#xD;
of Efile Hartly, with outstretched hands, and entreating&#xD;
eyes, which pantomime terminated in a waltz between them.&#xD;
Grace sat at the oW piano, playing very fast, and lookiDg&#xD;
around with a laughing face at the waltzers and the little&#xD;
flute player, while Josephine clapped her hands, and started&#xD;
oft' Jn a dance by herself.&#xD;
Ii hastily entered, and stood in their midst. Grace saw&#xD;
me first, and hounded from her seat, overturning it of course.&#xD;
Ii was clasped to her generous heart, and. our first laughter&#xD;
gave way to tears, which again gaye way to laughter, when&#xD;
Lilly exclaii~~d, "Oh, look at Miss Kate's bonnet!" When&#xD;
Cousin Nary came in, it was difficult for her to recognize&#xD;
the, forlorn inhabitant who was laughing and crying wthin&#xD;
the crooked bonnet. How cheery was the reunion.&#xD;
"What do you think of Kflie?" whispered Grace.&#xD;
"She looks like a lovely girl," IL replied. II thought not&#xD;
as lovely as Grace, whose face beamed with a sort of cele~-&#xD;
tial sunshine. There was an atmosphere of health and joy,&#xD;
an exulting strength breathing forth from the group, that&#xD;
seemed inspiriting after the patient resignation which IL had&#xD;
left in my Southern home. QThere is of'a-~truth a sphere&#xD;
encompassing every one, whii~h produces an impression, even&#xD;
if words be not spoken.) Why do we turn with shrinking&#xD;
ofttimes from kindest expressions, when we have no 'tangible&#xD;
reason to doubt their sincerity? An unseen contradiction&#xD;
is breathing out from the nature which speaks so fairly. IL&#xD;
saw with delight that the anxious look had left Efile's blue&#xD;
eyes,-zhat a quiet trust reposed on her childlike lips. She&#xD;
had nestled down like a bird in her new nest, believing there&#xD;
was ehartty on earth, and regeneration for the most sinful.&#xD;
Lilly and Josephine conferred together in whispers, and&#xD;
then left the room. "isn't that Lilly a glorious child?"&#xD;
asked Walter, with enthusiasm.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC8254-00000158"/>&#xD;
814                ~OH! CRACK !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes: Do you intend educating her for a wife?" I&#xD;
questioned.&#xD;
"Not exactly; but she's the most enchanting little crea-&#xD;
ture I ever saw. ~She'll be worth a dozen Judith Mortons!"&#xD;
He added the last sentence in an under tone.&#xD;
The charming children soon came back, with Cousin John&#xD;
between them. He greeted inc with apparent surprise, to&#xD;
please the children, who had made a great secret of their&#xD;
object in bringing him home. He had grown portly, and&#xD;
good-natured, but was not less pompous than usual in his&#xD;
general carriage.&#xD;
A~ I was going up stairs to humanize a little, after the&#xD;
dust and fatigue of the journey, I heard Cousin Mary (con-&#xD;
siderat~ mortal!) empowering Miss NeConkey to go to a fruit-&#xD;
shop and buy an incredible variety of delicious things for&#xD;
tea. As each thing was named to the fair maid, she, would&#xD;
exclair~i, "She likes them, does she ?-yes, I'll get 'em."&#xD;
When the list was finished, she uttered, "Oh, cracky!"&#xD;
"Mary, you must Pot say oh, cracky," gravely replied&#xD;
her mistress. I laughed to think a year had not improved&#xD;
Mary McConkey's manners one iota.&#xD;
It was a happy party that sat down to the evening board.&#xD;
If life would stop at the bright places, instead of hurrying&#xD;
oi~ ceaselessly, how many groups should we s&amp;amp;e reposing in&#xD;
the sunshine~&#xD;
"Will. Mr. Waidron be 8here to-night?" I asked of&#xD;
Grace, as we sought the parlor after tea~ She answered in&#xD;
the affirmative, and went on talking about him until II forgot&#xD;
that the world was any thing but a beautiful rose-garden&#xD;
filled with Cupids. She suddenly ceased speaking, and&#xD;
looked towards the door, her heart softly rising and falling,&#xD;
as the sweet vermilion fluttered to her cheek. I looked too,&#xD;
and Mr. Waldron came in, so happy, so handsome. I saw&#xD;
that within his eyes, which the poverty of ian~uage cannot&#xD;
&#xD;
814&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
L&#xD;

*&#xD;
&#xD;
AM I GOOD ENOUGH?               815&#xD;
express-Love. He spoke first with me, and then took the&#xD;
little hand of Grace, for one moment.&#xD;
Am I good enough for Grace, Cousin Kate?" he&#xD;
asked, laughing.&#xD;
"Ii think so !" I replied, "or you will be, if you don't&#xD;
monopolize her, and make her friends feel that they are in&#xD;
the way, as lovers always do."&#xD;
"IF intend to be very considerate," he returned, with the&#xD;
same happy laugh. "You may drive me away whenever you&#xD;
think I am bordering on selfishness."&#xD;
"May Ii? thank you!" I did thank him inwardly, for&#xD;
the frank and cordial manner, which instantly set me at ease,&#xD;
and assured me that Grace's husband would be one to trust&#xD;
as a part of herself.&#xD;
"You never will let Grace settle down, and find no world~&#xD;
out of her own family, as thousands do, will you?" I asked.&#xD;
"You won't let her grow old, and forget how every body&#xD;
feels? "&#xD;
"No," he answered, with affected gravity. "She shall&#xD;
be young enough to sympathize with you, when-"&#xD;
Miss Cardover opened the door, and stood with a smil-&#xD;
face there, exelaimino' " it unmerciful in me&#xD;
ing                  ~, Now, isn't&#xD;
to come the very instant Kate gets home?"&#xD;
Our heartfelt embrace would have assured any one that&#xD;
it would have been unmerciful had she stayed away. Mr.&#xD;
Cardover come forward and mat me kindly, saying, "I sug-&#xD;
gested that it might be wiser to wait until you were rested,&#xD;
but Elizabeth would not consent."&#xD;
"I am very glad you came," I returned, sitting down&#xD;
by Miss Cardover.&#xD;
"I am so glad you came, to be here at the wedding!"&#xD;
she said, in an under tone, giving my hand an extra pressure.&#xD;
"You know you and Pliny are to officiate."&#xD;
Yes; that seems to be the arrangement." After we&#xD;

816                 CONCEITED AS EvEn.                                                              JAMEIS J3EDELL.                   817.,&#xD;
&#xD;
had talked very fast for a while, I gave my scat to Cousin&#xD;
Mary, and went to Walter. "Don't Effie look contented?"&#xD;
he whispered. I added my rejoicing to his at her tranquil fate.&#xD;
Ills face lighted up with affection as he spoke of her daily&#xD;
efforts to win the esteem of those around her-and not their&#xD;
esteem only, but she strove to walk in a pure and true path.&#xD;
"And how do you pass your time, Walter?" I asked.&#xD;
"Oh, like the good Samaritan, of course! "he answered,&#xD;
returning instantly from his beautiful, earnest tone to a jest-&#xD;
ing one. "if am going to China in a ninth or two, as super-&#xD;
cargo on board of a vessel."&#xD;
"Is it possible? How long shall you be gone?"&#xD;
"Probably a year and a half. I shall want to see Lilly&#xD;
by that time, to ascertain whether she is growing up worthy~&#xD;
of me!"&#xD;
"Conceited as ever!" I responded, laughing.&#xD;
Miss Cardover rose to go. As Ii turned fi~om Walter my&#xD;
eyes encountered Mr. Cardover's, ai~d his earnest look had&#xD;
over me an irresistible power-I could not wholly translate&#xD;
it; it was grave, yet full of interest.&#xD;
We parted, with jests and light laughter. As if by in-&#xD;
tuition the whole family left Grace and hei' lover in the par-&#xD;
lor alone.&#xD;
"Oh, come in!" said Grace, as I followed behind the train&#xD;
that sought the dining-ro&amp;amp;m.&#xD;
"We shall have time to talk' to-morrow. I am tired."&#xD;
And so they were left to dream "Love's ybung dream" by&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
When' morning broke over us, and I lay beside Grace in&#xD;
the old, familiar room, I longed to ask her about Mr. Cardo-&#xD;
ver, but I did not.&#xD;
"Would you believe it, Kate?" she asked, " Elizabeth&#xD;
Cardover was once engaged to Horace, an'd she broke the&#xD;
&#xD;
engagement herself." Do you see how she could? A&#xD;
man like Horace!"&#xD;
"How long since was it?" I inquired, remembering the&#xD;
heart story Miss Cardover once told me.&#xD;
"Oh, it was a great many years ago, when they were&#xD;
very young."&#xD;
II wondered if through Miss Cardover's noble heart no&#xD;
strain of sadness went, when she looked upon the lovers, so&#xD;
radiant as they were in their happy abar~don.&#xD;
Weeks glided away. The wedding was 'to take place in&#xD;
October. We were busy beyond all description, sewing,&#xD;
running down street to match trimmings, and sacrificing&#xD;
ourselves to the jerks of an energetic dressmaker. Miss&#xD;
Cardover came in almost every day, and she often laid aside&#xD;
her bonnet to help us: she thought it was hardly worth&#xD;
while to be so industrious, as we expected to live a short&#xD;
time after the wedding. One day as we sat sewing thus,&#xD;
James Bedell suddenly entered.&#xD;
"Why, James!" we all exclaimed, "when did ~you&#xD;
come?"&#xD;
"Yesterday," he replied, greeting us separately as we&#xD;
rose from our work. Gertrude blushed very deeply when&#xD;
he took her hand, and in his eyes it was easy to read a grati-&#xD;
fied interest in her welcome, which was modest and quiet.&#xD;
"And now, what have you come back for so soon.?"&#xD;
asked Miss Cardover, "and why did you not come to our&#xD;
house immediately?"&#xD;
"In the first place," he returned, "I had business which&#xD;
required me to see the best chemist in Boston immediately,&#xD;
and after I had seen him, it was too late to go to you, aunt.&#xD;
I have just returned from your house."&#xD;
"Shall you stay long with us, James?" asked Miss&#xD;
Cardover, bending her affectionate eyes upon him.&#xD;
"A few weeks probably," he answered.&#xD;

THE DANCE-.&#xD;
&#xD;
After tea, our regular guests dropped in. These were&#xD;
Mr. Waidron, and Mr. Seth Cardover; but this tjme they&#xD;
were accompanied by Pliny. As the evening waned, it was&#xD;
clear that Gertrude appeared very charming in James's eyes.&#xD;
It made me feel lonely when I looked at them-it seemed&#xD;
sad that it was so easy to forget old affections.&#xD;
Grace and Gertrude sang some sweet old ballads, accom-&#xD;
panied by Mr. Waldron. Cousin Mary, true to her indus-&#xD;
trious habits, sat down by the table with her sewing. I&#xD;
took a skein of silk and placed it upon the back of a chair&#xD;
to wind.&#xD;
"May I hold it for you?" asked P~liny Cardover~, coming&#xD;
to me.&#xD;
"If ~you please!" I answered. The feeling of restraint&#xD;
I had often had in his j5resence left me, and we talked as&#xD;
gayly aS the others did. The universal hubbub that arose&#xD;
after the music ceased, seemed to be infectious.&#xD;
"Let us have a little dance! " said Grace, turning her&#xD;
sweet eyes upon Mr. Waidron. "You don't think it is&#xD;
wicked, Horacs, when it is not carried to extremes?"&#xD;
to "Oh, no," he replied, "it is not a new accomplishment&#xD;
and he took Grace's willing' hand, and led her out&#xD;
the floor.&#xD;
Walter took his place at th9 piano. Mr. Bedell sought&#xD;
Gertrude as a partner, Pliny said "come? ~' and I went.&#xD;
Effie had left the room, so Mr. Seth Cardover invited Cousin&#xD;
Mary.&#xD;
"Why, I have not danced in ten years!" she replied,&#xD;
drawing back..&#xD;
"And I have not in fifteen, Mrs. IRodmanV' retorted&#xD;
Mr~ Seth. "I lodk upon it in the light of a duty--we&#xD;
ought to amuse the others."&#xD;
Cousin Mary consented, and the evening flitted away&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
A BOUQUIRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
in a hearty merriment that left us feeling exceedingly well&#xD;
acquainted with each other.&#xD;
The next day we were to go to the new house Which the&#xD;
bridal pair were furnishing, to put up parlor curtains. Mr.&#xD;
Waldron was coming to go with us. When the knocker&#xD;
sounded Grace and I were in our room: she was completing&#xD;
her toilette.&#xD;
"Run down, Kate, and see who it is!" she said.&#xD;
I accordingly went, and found Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
" Come in," I said, opening the parlor door, and entering.&#xD;
"Grace and I are going to the new house as soon as Mr.&#xD;
Waldron comes, but Mrs. Rodman and Miss Hartly are at&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"Suppose I were going to the new house too, Kate?"&#xD;
He had called me Miss Kate before.&#xD;
"That would be very agreeable."&#xD;
Would it? "&#xD;
"Yes, certainly."&#xD;
"Here is a bouquet for you, Miss Kate!"&#xD;
"How beautiful it is!,' I said, taking it: it was composed&#xD;
of white rose buds, with glossy leaves of box.&#xD;
"Do you think a bouquet perfect without red?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"No; why didn't you put a pink rose-bud in?"&#xD;
"I feared it might not suit you: love colors the white&#xD;
rose-red," the last words he spoke in a low tone: a blush&#xD;
went thrilling through me.&#xD;
"Shall I place a red rose among the flowers?" he asked&#xD;
ii~ the same tone. I felt that his eyes were upon me, press.&#xD;
ing downward the lids I could not lift up.&#xD;
"Aye!" and he took my hand. At this moment I heard&#xD;
Grace tripping down stairs: she came in the parlor.&#xD;
"Mr. Waldron has not come?" she said, inquiringly.&#xD;
"No; he desired me to say that he was engaged at pre-&#xD;

320                  OUR HOUSE.&#xD;
sent. lie will meet us at the house," said 'Mr. Cardover.&#xD;
"You see, Grace, I#i have availed myself of your invitation to&#xD;
assist in your housekeeping arrangements."&#xD;
"Yes, why shouldn't you be useful ?" responded Grace,&#xD;
gayly. "I asked you last evening,, but I had no idea that&#xD;
you would condescend to accept my invitation." Shie turned&#xD;
to me. "Come, Kitty, get ready; we are waiting for&#xD;
you.&#xD;
I hastened up stairs for my bonnet and gloves. I half&#xD;
.1~'&#xD;
tliought from Grace s manner, that she began to suspect my&#xD;
heart history, for a beautiful light shone upon inc from her&#xD;
clear eyes as Ii left the room-~-a new, astonished light it&#xD;
was!&#xD;
Ere long' we started on our walk. A warm September&#xD;
sulk shone down upon us; it was a dreamy, halcyon day, sug..&#xD;
gestive only of joy. The new house wa~ situated in a retired&#xD;
street: two fine elm trees stood in front of it, and the grass&#xD;
in the small area was smooth and green, from frequent cut-&#xD;
ting. The dwelling itself was not large; it was plain, and&#xD;
less handsome than I. had supposed it would be, for Mr.&#xD;
Waldron had the reputation of wealth. When Grace opened&#xD;
the hall door, it seemed like ushering us into a little tem~de&#xD;
of domestic peace,-so new, and bright, and cheerful it&#xD;
looked.&#xD;
"What do you think of our house?" asked Grace, as we&#xD;
stood in the cosy parlors, treading upon a carpet which was&#xD;
a garden of rich roses and shaded greenness; we deluded&#xD;
ourselves into the belief that it was a flower-covered prairie&#xD;
we pressed.&#xD;
"It is very charming! the house is pleasant, the furni-&#xD;
ture tasteful; but Grace, I supposed you would be a little&#xD;
more extravagant. If thought Mr. Waldron would put his&#xD;
bird into the most splendid'. cage to be found."&#xD;
Grace smiled and answered, "Horace has unpaid debts&#xD;
&#xD;
TilE ARRANGEMENTS.   '          321&#xD;
on his hands. It is against his principles to be generous&#xD;
before he is just. I was not willing that any extravagance&#xD;
of ouvs should delay the settlement of those accounts."&#xD;
"That~is right. You are beginning the world beautifully.&#xD;
I~very thing i~ char~ning, and when those curtains are hung,&#xD;
the effect will be finer than that produced in thousands of&#xD;
more costly homes. Only I thought that money-worshippers&#xD;
would not discover beauty, unless a high price assured them&#xD;
of its existence."&#xD;
We went to work with hearty good will, assisting Mr.&#xD;
Carciover in putting up the embroidered curtains. ' After&#xD;
they were hung, it took us a long time to ai~range the folds&#xD;
with that high degree of carelessne~ whieh we deemed&#xD;
necessary. When at last we were perfectly satisfied, we took&#xD;
otir station in the centre of the parlors, and gazed around&#xD;
with smiling lips, observing the general effect. All the&#xD;
colors in the rooms were sweetly blended, the graceful trifles,&#xD;
and one or two exquisite statuettes gave forth, as it were, an&#xD;
expression of the characters of Mm Waldron and Grace. The&#xD;
western sunset poured through the lace curtains in a golden&#xD;
mist. Mr. Waldron caine in as we were still entranced in&#xD;
observation and pleasant thoughts. When his glance of&#xD;
heavenly tenderness rested on his betrothed bride, it seemed&#xD;
as if some sweet, spiritual sunshine cast a mellowed glory&#xD;
over the new home, and over each heart then folded within&#xD;
it. We had half a mind to take our tea in the conservatory,&#xD;
which opened from the back parlor, only we had no provi-&#xD;
sions. Mr. Waldron proposed that we should all go market-&#xD;
ing together in family style. It was finally agreed that the&#xD;
two gentlemen should sally forth, and bring us something to&#xD;
set a table with. As soon as we had closed the door after&#xD;
them, we ran laughing to our duties. By dint of great' ex-&#xD;
ertion we got a table from the basement into the cons~nva-&#xD;
tory, and laid it with a snowy cloth a~td dishes; after which&#xD;

&#xD;
we descended to the yard, and gathered some fresh flowers&#xD;
to ornament the table with.&#xD;
" IL fear the congregation would think it ought to be in-&#xD;
vited to our little repast," said Grace, laughing," if it should&#xD;
be discovered what a nice time we are having!"&#xD;
"It will be time for you to put on the airs of a minis-&#xD;
ter's wiTh when you. are really married, Grace," I said.&#xD;
"Do let us enjoy ourselves now, and be just a's nonsensical&#xD;
as we can."&#xD;
"Don't it seem perfectly wonderful, Kate, that this clear&#xD;
house is ours ? and that-that-well ! isn't it all surprising&#xD;
and beautiful ?" Grace laughed and blushed, and seated&#xD;
herself on the window-step conimuni eating with the parlors.&#xD;
What a lovely picture she was in her happy sweetness. She&#xD;
looked so fondly around her home.&#xD;
Let us go up stairs," she said, suddenly rising, "you&#xD;
haVe not been up there." She took me first to Mr. Wal-&#xD;
dron's study. Above his writing-table hung the picture of&#xD;
Hope, which bore so strong a resemblance to Grace.&#xD;
"Horace would have it in his study," ~he said in reply&#xD;
to my smiling glanc~i. "Do you see, Kate, that every thing&#xD;
in this room has be~n brought from the study at Blooming&#xD;
Hill? I have ha~i every thing arranged the same, be-&#xD;
cause-"&#xD;
"Because what?~~&#xD;
"Why, when we visited at Mr. Waldron's parents, you&#xD;
remember we went into Horace's study. When IL saw that&#xD;
picture, and met Horace's look, i[ felt as if his whole saul&#xD;
were revealed to me---.i[ realized how noble and great his&#xD;
love for me was. It was the happiest moment of my life.&#xD;
So I love to preserve the memory of the room, and of that&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"IL had no dream that you loved him then, Grace."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I scarcely knew when I began to love him myself" she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
We went into the other rooms, and I admired every&#xD;
thing with all my heart. Finally Grace took me to the&#xD;
guest chamber.&#xD;
"This is for you, Kitty," she said.&#xD;
"Oh, What ~ lovely bureau, and wash-stand, and bed-&#xD;
stead and carpet!" IL exclaimed.&#xD;
We heard thc~ night-key turn in the front door, and ran&#xD;
down stairs to see what we were to have for tea. Mr. Wal-&#xD;
dron paine iu bearing a new willow basket loaded down with&#xD;
something. We all fluttered into the conservatory behind&#xD;
him. 'When he deposited his basket on the floor, Grace&#xD;
opened it and drew fQrth first a watermelon, then peaches,&#xD;
then grapes, then a small paper.&#xD;
"What is this?" she asked.&#xD;
"Oh, that is tea.' IL can make a fire down stairs, can't&#xD;
I?" said Mr. Waldron.&#xD;
"There is nothing to make it with," we both replied.&#xD;
"Cold water is much better," returned the two gentle-&#xD;
men.&#xD;
Grace caine across a fruit. cake, then another paper.&#xD;
"What is this?" she asked, raising her laughing eyes to her&#xD;
lover.&#xD;
"That is smoked salmon," he replied. "We saw. a man&#xD;
in a grocery cutting it off, and that reminded us that we'&#xD;
ought to have some."&#xD;
"No bread and butter," she said in an under tone to me,&#xD;
as I knelt down by her. Our arrangements were soon made,&#xD;
and we sat down to the table.&#xD;
"How perfectly charming it is to satisfy. the appetite on&#xD;
extras!" said Grace, as the gentlemen seemed to miss the&#xD;
"staff of life," with~ some surprise. They wisely praised'&#xD;
every thing we had, and refrained from hinting that wc&#xD;

324          THE RETURN TO COUSIN MARY,&#xD;
&#xD;
needed any thing more. I doubt if any of us eared much&#xD;
what we had. We seemed shut in from the world, too happy&#xD;
and merry ever to care about leaving the neW home. But&#xD;
the hour~warned us that we must go, and very reluctantly&#xD;
we prepared to do so. When the conservatory ~as restored&#xD;
to its primitive order, and we had darkened the rooms, we&#xD;
left the house, and wended our way to Cousin Mary's.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
THE next day was set apart to make the weddi&#xD;

came in with a clean gingham apron on, and her s.&#xD;
up from her snowy arms.&#xD;
"Kitty, I wish you would, help me," she said&#xD;
"I don't know how, Grace. There is enoug&#xD;

"But you ought to learn. Pliny likes home&#xD;

blushing and joining her gay laugh.&#xD;
"Some quiet day, Grace," I said, I am~&#xD;
you all my heart; every~ bit of it, from beginning&#xD;
"Perhaps I have been learning somE~thing&#xD;
Ah, I am so glad!" She threw her arms arou'&#xD;
impulsive warmth, and kissed me.&#xD;
" Oh, don't be so premature," I entreated, r&#xD;

"Kate, Miss Cardover wished me to send fo&#xD;

&#xD;
mid-day, and very warm. The blind door was so, turned as&#xD;
to admit a current of air into the hail. ~he parlor 'door&#xD;
was open. I heard voices, proceeding thence as ]i rung the&#xD;
street b~ll. No dne came immediately, and I heard Pliny's&#xD;
name mentioned; then Mips Cardover said,&#xD;
"Br~ther thinks Kate would make an excellent wife;&#xD;
he likes her, and admires her. He says if he could get up&#xD;
the same kind of feeling for her that he had for ~raee, he&#xD;
would offer himself to-morrow."&#xD;
How the humiliating blushes burned in my cheeks as I&#xD;
heard this. How the hot 'waves of indignation rolled&#xD;
through m~. The expression, "if he could get up the same&#xD;
kind of feeling," galled me to the soul. I felt as if II could&#xD;
set foot upon- my living heart, and keep it for ever still,&#xD;
rather than to be thus accepted by Pliny 'Cardover. I saw&#xD;
a servant coming through the hall. I lowered my veil to&#xD;
conceal the agony of pride and passion that consumed me.&#xD;
I delivered my message, and hastened from the house, before&#xD;
Miss Cardover could ascertain that I had been there. I went&#xD;
home mechanically, and after II had thrown my white rose~~&#xD;
buds out of the window, I proceeded to fulfil all my duties.&#xD;
Every one about the house was too busy to be observing. I&#xD;
knew that when I received that little bunch of flower~, my&#xD;
long kept secret escaped me-it was written in my face. i[&#xD;
would have given worlds to have recalled that five minutes.&#xD;
Evening came. The air was so balmy and delicious, that&#xD;
nearly all the members of the family went out fbr a walk.&#xD;
I crept up to my room, and sat down in the pale twilight.&#xD;
It glided~ away, and' the stars stole out one by one. Efile&#xD;
came into th~ room.&#xD;
"'oh, Kate!" she exclaimed, in surprise, "I thought&#xD;
you had gone out to walk with the others.&#xD;
I am indulging in day dreams," I answered bitterly.&#xD;
"Mr. Cardover is down stairs. He inquired for you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"1 don't care about going down. You will do just as&#xD;
well, Effie."&#xD;
"But he asked for you, Kate. You ought to go down.&#xD;
Shall I bring you a light? Do you want to arrange your&#xD;
hair?" she asked kindly.&#xD;
" No, it does not matter how it looks. Is there a light&#xD;
in the parlor "&#xD;
"No, the street lamp shines in sufficiently. The mus-&#xD;
quitoes are too thick to have a lamp burning in the parlor.&#xD;
Here is a letter for you, hate."&#xD;
I took it, and saw from the direction that it was from&#xD;
Mrs. 1Jenry~ I ran my eye over the contents.&#xD;
"I am going 'back South to teach, Effie," I said, as I&#xD;
left the room. I did not wait to hear her exclamations.&#xD;
When I entered the parlor Mr. Cardover rose and bowed,&#xD;
and then resumed his seat by the window, which wa~ oppo-&#xD;
site the street lamp. The rays fell upon his white forehead,&#xD;
and displayed in bold relief the nobly shaped head. I&#xD;
sought a seat by the other window, which was in the shade.&#xD;
Cousin Mary came in from her walk, a moment after I had.&#xD;
entered the room. When she saw that Mr. Cardover and I&#xD;
were alone, and probably felt that we were not at ease, she&#xD;
would have passed into the sitting-room. II called her back,&#xD;
saying,&#xD;
"I have just received a letter from Mrs. Henry, Cousin&#xD;
Mary."&#xD;
"Well ?" she said inquiringly, for I had expressed my-&#xD;
self in an undecided way about going back, whenever it had&#xD;
been mentioned.&#xD;
"I think I shall return to them. They are all very ur-&#xD;
gent that I should do so."&#xD;
"But,, Kate, I shall be' so lonely without Grace," said&#xD;
Cousin Mary, entreatingly'.&#xD;
Yes, but you were willing I should go before, because&#xD;

328                THE QUESTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
you thought I might bp useful. L a~n sure nox~ that I am&#xD;
more needed there than here. This is home."&#xD;
Cousin Mary left the room quietly.&#xD;
"Why do you go, Kate?" asked Mr. Cardover ear-&#xD;
nestly.&#xD;
"Because I want to see a little more of the world, i[&#xD;
suppose," I answered lightly.&#xD;
Mr. Cardover crossed the room, and sat down by me.&#xD;
"Will Kitty go with me to see the world?" he asked, tak-&#xD;
ing my hand. un his, and bending his head, while his tones&#xD;
thrilled through me electrically.&#xD;
"No!" I answered scarcely above a breath, drawing&#xD;
away my hand.&#xD;
Aye?" he said, bowing his ear to my lips.&#xD;
Again I could scarcely frame the word ~No.~1&#xD;
"Why?" he questioned, still wijth his bent head, and in&#xD;
that same deep tone, as if the drapery had been .swept away&#xD;
from, our souls, and he would not allow it to fall back again.&#xD;
I could not speak. I felt my pride and courage dying. I&#xD;
longed to be away in my own room, where I could yield to&#xD;
the emotion that flooded my being. I could not move.' I&#xD;
sat quiet, with rapidly be'atii~ig heart.&#xD;
"Don't you love me, Kitty?"&#xD;
I dared not lie. I felt that our inmost souls were in ~he&#xD;
presence of the Infinite.&#xD;
"Don't you love me, Kitty?" Again his tremulous.&#xD;
hand took mine.&#xD;
"I esteem you!" I forced utterance to the words.&#xD;
"Don't you love me, Kitty?" he repeated. Oh, how&#xD;
infinitely tender it sounded. My heart was drooping beneath&#xD;
the n~agnetism. Almost I had yielded, but I clung to the&#xD;
bitter memory of the morning, and it gave me strength.&#xD;
"I do not love you well enough to marry you!" I said~&#xD;
withdrawing my hand more hastily than before.' I rose, and&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE INTOLERABLE NIGHT.           ~29&#xD;
fled to my chamber. I' cast myself upon my knees a~ the&#xD;
bedside, drooping beneath th~power that impelled me to go&#xD;
to him again. II clasped my hands, and restrained ~he im-&#xD;
pulse. I heard the street door 'close. Oh, then I felt that&#xD;
T was ~nad and wild-that I had. sold my heart to~ misery,&#xD;
and had heaped upon my head a weight under which I should&#xD;
die. To be near him ever more-to be thought worthy of&#xD;
his choice-it should have satisfied me. I remembered that&#xD;
there ~vas a 'stern decision in Mr. Cardover~s character, a&#xD;
haughtiness not wholly extinguished by the cultivation of&#xD;
nobler qualities, and II despaired of ever hearing again such&#xD;
pleading tones from him. The intolerable night passed!&#xD;
With the dawii I said, "How to live?" But' the impulse&#xD;
which had nerved me to slay my peace, helped me to bear it&#xD;
in silence. When I arose, Ii looked with anxiety into the&#xD;
glass, to see if my face betrayed the anguish within. hag-&#xD;
gard as I looked, I wondered still to see my brow calm, my&#xD;
eyes quiet and tearless, albeit a fire burned in their depths.&#xD;
All day long we were busy. Fo~ two weeks we were busy,&#xD;
and every evening others came to see us, but not Mr. Car-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
A DARKENED 'room: a miserable mother weeping beside a&#xD;
cradle, where lay an infant child, just recovering from fear-&#xD;
ful convulsions. Scarcely has the purple blackness receded&#xD;
from the face: scarcely have the contorted limbs drooped&#xD;
into weak passiveness: scarcely have the rolling eyeballs&#xD;
sunk into their suddenly hollowed sockets. The mother sits&#xD;
by and gazes, while the' cold sweat of fear is yet unwiped&#xD;
from her brow. "Oh, lif'e, terrible thou art! " she groans&#xD;
in her helplessness; "and death, how far more terrible !"&#xD;
The pallid brow of Judith drops between her hands: she is&#xD;
not strong enough for the lif~-battle: she cannot understand&#xD;
it: she sees no meaning in it: but she gropes her way, and mad-&#xD;
ly wars with gigantic ills, beating herself against priso~ming&#xD;
fate, and reading in the Great Hereafter a cold, shadowy&#xD;
nothingness, compared with the living present. "Shall Isa&#xD;
be borne from her sight? Shall her matchless limbs be&#xD;
straightened for the coffin? her gleeful voice hushed by the&#xD;
ghastly tyrant? her glorious, loving eyes robbed Of their&#xD;
shine? her baby lips despoiled of their smile? and 'tho&#xD;
sweet dimples pillowed under the sod, with the soft, curling&#xD;
hair? Shall the pretty hand cease to stroke her cheek, with&#xD;
winsome laugh? Ah! her love was innocent, absorbing!&#xD;
Would it not have been undying? 'Had it not kept the&#xD;
mother more holy than she could have bpen without it?&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE PARENTS TOGETHER.&#xD;
&#xD;
331&#xD;
&#xD;
Had it not smitten the rock, until mere healing 'waters had&#xD;
gushed through the barren nature? And now can a God&#xD;
of mercy take her ?-take her while professing love and&#xD;
compassion for his miserable, pain-stricken creatures?"&#xD;
Judith sprung wildly to her feet; her reverie broken and&#xD;
fled. Again the Iittl~ one writhed in frightful convulsions,&#xD;
and her mother's energetic hand ~ninistored to her-bat&#xD;
vainly; the agony went on during its appointed time, and, then&#xD;
the shrunken sufferc' relapsed into pitiful slumber, destroying&#xD;
Judith's very spirit with the conviction of her uselessness.&#xD;
The servants stood around and g~ized upon their mistress with&#xD;
pity: a cold and haughty mistress she had been, never caring&#xD;
to learn whether their hearts were filled with joy or pain.&#xD;
Angelo, the servant whom Judith suspected of communicat-&#xD;
ing with his master, spoke in a low entreating tone to her.&#xD;
She merely bowed, and he hastily left the room. The other&#xD;
servants' guessed the import of his remark, and began to&#xD;
steal from th&amp;amp; chamber.&#xD;
"Stay!" said Judith briefly, and they came back. lit&#xD;
was not an hour ere the husband and father entered the&#xD;
chamber: Judith did not look at him,~ although his first&#xD;
glance fell upon her, filled with eager inquiry. He went and&#xD;
knelt besi4e the cradle: that punched, suffering face struck&#xD;
to the quick; he bowed his. head and wept, as men weep&#xD;
when their strong natures give way. The heart of the wife&#xD;
grew silent and calm: she sat and watched the death-shadow&#xD;
as it hovered on the countenance: quietly she wiped away&#xD;
the foam as it gathered on the lips: softly she took the little,&#xD;
beloved hands as they suddenly started up in their last&#xD;
struggle,, and then when it was ~mll over, she bowed her face,&#xD;
and hissed every feature-.tcaxlessly. She went away in an&#xD;
inner room to weep alone. Mar~e prepared the empty form&#xD;
for its little white dress.&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CONSOLATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
Days passed away: the funeral was over, and the averted&#xD;
eyes of the wife had not encountered those of her husband.&#xD;
~' Farewell again, Judith?" he asked.&#xD;
"Farewell!" she answered, still without looking towards&#xD;
him. He read her grief in tone and face: it was that morn-&#xD;
ing that the child had been buried: be comprehended the&#xD;
chill mourning of a deserted house; when friends are gone,&#xD;
and life, grown cold and fearful, resumes its accustoine~&#xD;
routine. He trusted to its appalling, subduing sway over&#xD;
that proud woman's heart, and he left her.&#xD;
A week had gone, ~d the lonely wife and childless mother&#xD;
had sunk under her so ~'row; fortitude she had none; for the&#xD;
first time it had forsa 'en her: she bowed under the woe,&#xD;
which had struck doi~n her idols: she was but a crushed&#xD;
weeper, rebellious, prayerful sometimes, and then blasphemous&#xD;
-hopeless ! Yet, less selfish, far as she still was from&#xD;
spiritual sympathy. Her friends were kind, but they were&#xD;
worldly, and only bade her not grieve: they showed her no&#xD;
reason why she should be comforted. Mixed with very&#xD;
prayer, came spirits ~f defiance. Why should she this be&#xD;
stricken? With the intensity of a selfish nature, she had&#xD;
eo~eentrated every good and pure emotion upon her ci ild:&#xD;
the little one had taught her her womanly nature, but a the&#xD;
same time came the impulse to sacrifice others to this c Aid.&#xD;
Marie's health, life, rest were of light import, compared ith&#xD;
a wayward fancy of isa's. Suddenly a thought st uck&#xD;
Madam Beuzoni: she recollected having seen a vener ble&#xD;
Catholic priest frequently, who seemed less hardened over by&#xD;
a debased worldliness than his compeers. She called Angelo,&#xD;
and sent for him. lie came! she knelt before him, and&#xD;
cleansed her soul by a confession, she could 'hardly pour out&#xD;
to her God, who seemed so distant, so tyrannical, so power~&#xD;
flil. The priest was of a simple nature, who amid poisons&#xD;
drained the honey of godlike charity; he rested his aged&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
hand upon the bent head of the mourner, and talked to her&#xD;
from his heart, rather than from his faith, until her anguish&#xD;
was lulled a~d soothed by his paternal words~ She related&#xD;
her history to him; all the struggles and agonies which had&#xD;
never before been breathed in human ear. The confession did&#xD;
her good, it broke down the hard walls which secretiveness&#xD;
builds about the heart: it was a blessing to her to indulge&#xD;
that frankness which should grow with time, rather than&#xD;
decrease. The priest left her, auid her weeping was more&#xD;
quiet,-the oil of consolation had fallen upon the ' waves of&#xD;
h~r spirit, "tempest tossed and not comforted," as they had&#xD;
been. The shadowy night drew on; cold, white shadowy&#xD;
seemed to haunt the room. Lights were brought in, and&#xD;
still the ghostly desolation within her being, was impressed&#xD;
upon every thing around her. *Where were the soft arms of&#xD;
her child? Alas! beneath the mould, where she must some&#xD;
day lie, until a pitiful God opened the graves. Poor Judith,&#xD;
with her sad want of spirituality, could never separate the&#xD;
garment from the real man. She shudderingly went to her&#xD;
Bible for one little drop of consolatidh, and it came: she&#xD;
knew i~ot how or whir, but it came and beamed around her,&#xD;
a warming light. She read, "Keep iiiuocency, and take heed&#xD;
unto the thing that is right; for that shall bring a man&#xD;
peace at the last." From her spirit broke entreating&#xD;
prayers that she might win the jewels which bring peace at&#xD;
last. How often would we weep with pity if we could look&#xD;
in 'upon the weak prayers of cold and sdfish hearts, when&#xD;
struck by arrows which gayety cannot ward off, neither all&#xD;
the light brilliance of a worldly atmosphere.&#xD;
The door of Judith's' room softly opened, and Benzoni&#xD;
came in, bending upon her~his dark eyes. She n~et them,&#xD;
all tearful as were her own. She rose, and gazed ~ut into&#xD;
the starry darkness of the night. Her husband went to her&#xD;
side, not with faltering step of fear, as once before, bu't with&#xD;

&#xD;
confidence. lli~ eyes had gleamed upon her like those of a&#xD;
friend hi her dreariness, but' she, could not stretch forth her&#xD;
hand when he came; pride still was too powerful. His&#xD;
presence was in her heart, although she turned no recognizing&#xD;
look to the handsome face near her: back upou her welled&#xD;
her former wild idolatry; she sunk beneath it: she thirsted&#xD;
for words of tenderness from the father of hei~ child. lie&#xD;
spoke at; last, low, and in a voice whose music and pathos she&#xD;
had never heard equalled.&#xD;
"Dear Judith, have you forgiWen me yet? Have I&#xD;
suffered enough for the wrong I did you?"&#xD;
She clamped her white hands over ~er face; her frame&#xD;
shook with wild sobs.&#xD;
"Beloved wife! poor stricken mother! do you heed me&#xD;
at last?" he murmured,, passing his strong arm around her&#xD;
trembling form. She started back, and gazed at him: she&#xD;
spoke with subdued accent.&#xD;
"You struck me to the earth once: dare I trust myself&#xD;
to you again?"&#xD;
"How can you doubt me, dearest?"&#xD;
"Have you more mercy and forbearance now, Giovanni ?"&#xD;
she asked entreatingly.&#xD;
"I have a love which has been purified by sniabring..&#xD;
patience which has been won by suffering also."&#xD;
She laid 4ier hand within his; and then with passionate&#xD;
abandonment she clasped her arms around his neck: he folded&#xD;
her to his heart,, and lifted up her face, showering it with&#xD;
tears and kisses: forehead, eyes, and lips he pressed: and&#xD;
then the beautiful face hid itself in his breast, as if a shelter&#xD;
had been found at last. Poor, weary one! she sought the&#xD;
shelter of a heart more unprincipled than her own: she&#xD;
believed in promises of love, when that love had but an&#xD;
unstable foundation. She looked up ~in his superb eyes,&#xD;
melting with tenderness, and did not read in their soft shine&#xD;

face, when hers had again wearied him. She held to her&#xD;
bosom flower~ of love, never dreaming the wreath might con-&#xD;
ceal. a cross, which should be nailed to her naked sQul.&#xD;
None of this did she see : he was now given as the console&#xD;
of her dark hour: through the present, he poured the rosy&#xD;
tide of refreshment and hope: he taught her faith in the&#xD;
beautiful and glad, when she might; have lapsed into unlov-&#xD;
ing despair, had the clouds still brooded above her.&#xD;
"Dearest, do you think you were entirely faultless?" he&#xD;
asked, smoothing the careless ringlets, and then pressing one&#xD;
to his lips.&#xD;
"Oh! no, Giovanni, I was thoughtless aud wilful: I have&#xD;
learned better now. Do you forgive me too?"&#xD;
"Yes, birdie!" he responded.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
IT was the marriage day! So holy it seemed, that I stole&#xD;
from our chamber ere Grace had prayed. I felt that she&#xD;
ought t6 k~eel in her maiden loveliness alone before her&#xD;
Creator the last time. When an hour after I went back to&#xD;
her, the soft tight shining through her face made me feel&#xD;
that she was t athed in the glory of love-both Divine and&#xD;
human love.&#xD;
"Oh!" she uttered fervently," I hope that II may make&#xD;
a good wife-a devoted minister's wife! '~ and she clasped&#xD;
her hands softly, as if entreatingly. "But, dearest Kate, II.&#xD;
ought not to look forward with this expectation of boundless&#xD;
joy-li ought to feel as if I couldgive up my happiness for&#xD;
a season, if it should be required lit seemsif it should be&#xD;
taken from me, that I should be like a flower broken from&#xD;
th~ stalk."&#xD;
'"But why think it may?" I askod.&#xD;
"I do not feel as if it will," she replied with a radiant&#xD;
smile, "but I thirst to feel aright about it-li desire to feel&#xD;
hourly, momently, as if it is the ~ift of our loving Lord.&#xD;
Gratitude demands of me that my heart should ever be&#xD;
opened to the Supreme Giver, and ever ready to kneel and&#xD;
offer it~ joy to Him, for He would not take it without reason.&#xD;
I believe there are few on earth who have realized such&#xD;

&#xD;
gracious happiness as fills my life, lit is different from any&#xD;
joy I ever experienced before. lit is so holy, and its serene&#xD;
gladness seems as if drawn from far-off Paradise-and thither&#xD;
it seems to tend also. I love to shut my eyes soxne'times upon&#xD;
the intervening earth life, and look onward to the time when&#xD;
I shall wander through an Eden landscape, with a splendid&#xD;
angel beside me, and that angel, Horace!"&#xD;
"Your life ixiust be very beautiful!" ]I sighed. " You&#xD;
are fully beloved. How easy it will be for you to boar the&#xD;
small disquietudes of every-day existence."&#xD;
"Yes, it scorns a~ if a blessed patience is born within&#xD;
me. II can stretch out my hand with a smile to meet some&#xD;
daily cares. I am eager to bear them wisely, for I feel that&#xD;
I ought to do, oh, so much ! while I am crowned with his&#xD;
heavenly light and love."&#xD;
"You give me a blessing, dear Grade, for I realize that&#xD;
your joy is a reality as well as the pains that someti~nes&#xD;
come to us." I said this, and I felt it as II spoke, but with&#xD;
the next moment a deep, mighty yearning to put away the&#xD;
sorrowful, and to clasp the joyful, prevailed within me.&#xD;
We went down to breakfast, and then returned to our&#xD;
chamber to make bridal wreaths. Any one who has had a&#xD;
wedding in the house, knows how impossible it is for the&#xD;
bride to be secluded. Cousin Mary, Gertrude, and Effie&#xD;
followed by Josephine, came to look at the wedding orna~&#xD;
ments, and at C raco.&#xD;
C( She will be a bride this evening!" said Josephine&#xD;
0&#xD;
meditatively.&#xD;
"Yes," responded Cou~in Mary-, fondly smoothing the&#xD;
soft brown hair of 0- - - dropping a tear upon ft.&#xD;
"Grace," asked ~trude, "you will always love us as&#xD;
well as if you wer~ not harried, won't you?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear!" replied Grace, with a slightly quivering&#xD;
lip. Even Cousin John cafne up to look at the bride's'&#xD;

&#xD;
snowy dress, which had just been spread upon the bed. He&#xD;
jested about our looking so serious.&#xD;
"Cousin Kate, are you going to wear a veil like the&#xD;
bride?" Josephine pushed back her golden burls as she&#xD;
looked up.&#xD;
"No, little daisy. I shall only wear a white dress very&#xD;
much like Grace's."&#xD;
"And shall you go with them to Blooming Hill?"&#xD;
"Yes, Ithink so!"&#xD;
Evening at length came. The house was brilliantly&#xD;
lighted, and lavishly decorated with flowers. It fell to my&#xD;
lot to arrange the rich, wavy masses of the bride's hair; to&#xD;
fasten the veil, and crown her with the wreath; and while II&#xD;
did it, no festal thoughts and dreams sang to my heart.&#xD;
Grace looked like a blessed vision from the upper world,&#xD;
when the bridal dress floated around her, and the mist-like&#xD;
veil waved past~ her rose-tilted cheek. I kn6lt before her to&#xD;
gather the skirt of her dress in even waves, and I could not&#xD;
forbear kissing the little satin slipper that poised itself&#xD;
daintily upon a cricket for a moment. She was lovely with-&#xD;
in also, a beautiful human being from inmosts to outermosts.&#xD;
I could have knelt long before her, with clasped hands and&#xD;
streaming eyes, impressing upon my aching heart the sQoth-&#xD;
ing picture which foreshadowed heaven. But all impulses&#xD;
had been hushed at my heart for many weary days.&#xD;
"Let us lead. you down!" besought. Gertrude and Jose-&#xD;
phine, ranging themselves on each side of her. They went&#xD;
down to the guest-chamber, where Mr. Waidron and Mr. Car-&#xD;
dover were. Effie ilartly employed her tasteful fingers in ar-&#xD;
ranging my toilette. Excitement hnd given me a little color.&#xD;
If II ~had been happy, I shoidd have been more than satisfied&#xD;
with my appearance, for I had never looked so well.&#xD;
Josephine came fluttering into the room. "Oh, how&#xD;
splendid!" she exclaimed. "-I wish I were a bridesmaid,&#xD;
&#xD;
or a bride. Mother ~4s, will you please come down, Kate,&#xD;
if you are. ready. She says you must.practise taking your&#xD;
places, so that, you won't make any mistakes, when you get&#xD;
married before the company."&#xD;
My heart beat violently at the thought of meeting Mr.&#xD;
Gardover, whom I had not seen since the evening that I re-&#xD;
jected him. I sat down to collect myself to gain a calm&#xD;
exterior; but every instant the volume of feeling I had sup-&#xD;
pressed all day, grew stronger, until it seemed more than I&#xD;
could master. I dared not let tears fall, for how would 1a&#xD;
tearful bridesmaid look? At length I followed close behind&#xD;
Effie and. Josephine. The family were all gathered in the&#xD;
guest-chamber, which was not as light as the rest of the&#xD;
house; low tones broke on my ea~ as I neared the room,&#xD;
such tones as loving hearts utter at deep moments . of their&#xD;
lives. Cousin Mary was speaking with Gra6e, whose bosom&#xD;
heaved with heart-restrained emotion. Mr. Waldron gazed&#xD;
on her anxiously as he saw that her heart was realizing the&#xD;
dear ti~s she was breaking. Mr. Cardover stood beside him.&#xD;
He bowed, lowering his eyes as I entered. I went and stood&#xD;
by Cousin Mary.&#xD;
With smiles tremulous as tears, we practiced the mar-&#xD;
riage ceremony-.-.the clergyman spoke quietly with the bride&#xD;

entered the silent assemblage with aowncast eyes, and took&#xD;
our places: th~ ceremony was pe~4brmed, the ring encircled&#xD;
the finger of the newly-wedded wife, and then over the si-&#xD;
lence sounded from the lips of the white~haired minister&#xD;
these words: "May the Lord bless you and~keep you: may&#xD;
the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be.~gracious&#xD;
unto you: may the Lord lift up fhe light of his countenance&#xD;
upon you, and give you peace."' .&#xD;
As this blessing fell with thrilling solemn utterance, sud-&#xD;
den, quiet tears fell also: tears that dropped from the eyes&#xD;

&#xD;
of the bride, and from the guests. We knelt in prayer, and&#xD;
in hushed, holy weeping the tumult passed away from my&#xD;
spirit. When we arose,-ani warm hands grasped ours, and&#xD;
kind eyes smiled a benediction, it was as if a shower had&#xD;
passed, leaving the heavens tranquil. Gay and smiling&#xD;
words were on our lips all the evening, even to the end ,and&#xD;
never once did F catch a recognizing gleam from the face&#xD;
that bent forward so often with courtesy to others.&#xD;
A few days h~I4 passed, a~nd Grace was installed as mistress&#xD;
of her new home. The minister and his bride were to give&#xD;
a large party to his congregation. This seemed very charm-&#xD;
ing to Grace; she desired in her own house to meet the&#xD;
many in whose best welfare she was interested-she desired&#xD;
to turn towards" the flock" with a loving and earnest spirit-~-~.&#xD;
how little they comprehended as yet the pure and strong&#xD;
soul that had adopted~ them with a devotion equal to their&#xD;
pastor's. Cousin Mary, Gertrude and I spent the day as:&#xD;
listing Grace. Whe~ii nightfall caine, and we went home to&#xD;
dress, I felt as if it would be better for inc to remain, than&#xD;
to pass another sleepless night recalling the events of the&#xD;
evening; but my absence would have been embarkedd, and Ii&#xD;
could not resist the desire to ~1ook onep more into the eyes&#xD;
which had heeded me so little on the wedding night. So Ji&#xD;
went! We found Grace receiving her guests at the side of&#xD;
her husband; how good and how happy they looked. I&#xD;
half envied my lovely &amp;amp;ousin! she realized with smiling&#xD;
faith that her destiny was secure; she had a noble heart to&#xD;
turn to amid every storm. Beldved and admired by all who&#xD;
approached her, her soul ran over with gladness. I secured&#xD;
a quiet corner. How eagerlyy I listened to every voice that&#xD;
entered the hall. IL scarcely dared look up when the fami-&#xD;
liar one fell on my ear: I wondered if it would ever say&#xD;
again "Kitty" in the tone so dear to me. Mr. Cardover&#xD;
&#xD;
WhAT IS TUE MATTI~R?            341&#xD;
accidentally sat quite near to mc, and he included me in the&#xD;
general bow with which he saluted the ladies next me: he&#xD;
entered into conversation with his next neighbor quietly and&#xD;
agreeably as he ever did, but when the lamp shone on his&#xD;
face, I saw that it was paler than usual. I yearned for one&#xD;
kind, forgiving glance, but it did not come. Walter s~t be-&#xD;
side me, and talked so gently and kindly: his observing eye&#xD;
comprehended that I was not happy, and that I desired to&#xD;
shrink from notice. Once I saw Mr. Cardover's glance&#xD;
riveted upon Walter with an carnestand searching expression&#xD;
that revealed to me a new thought; he was wondering if&#xD;
Walter loved me. The slow hours glided away, laden with&#xD;
disappointment.&#xD;
"Will Mr. Cardover walk home with you 'U' inquired&#xD;
Walter, who saw that something was amiss.&#xD;
"No!" I simply said.&#xD;
Wheii we left the house, my arm lay in Walter's, and&#xD;
Mr. Cardover stood where he observed it.&#xD;
The next evening the same weary performance was to be&#xD;
enacted at Miss Cardover's. I went with the resolution of&#xD;
appearing very gay and happy, but found I had miserably&#xD;
succeeded in m~ly design, for Miss Cardover caught my hand,&#xD;
and took me with her to the dressing-room; she seated&#xD;
herself in front of me deliberately.&#xD;
"Now, Kate," she said, "what's the matter between you&#xD;
and Pliny? You look as despairing as two death's heads.&#xD;
Pliny is wretched. Have you been quarrelingg"&#xD;
"No I" I answered, my heart thrilling with the wild&#xD;
hoj e that Pliny loved me more deeply than he had supposed.&#xD;
"What is the matter then 'U' persisted Miss Cardover.&#xD;
"Your brother wa~ kind enough to think IL might. answer&#xD;
for awife!"&#xD;
"Did he offer himself to you 'U' asked Miss Cardover,.&#xD;
her dark eyes beginning to flash.&#xD;

342                  THE SECRET.&#xD;
"I believe he did!"&#xD;
CC Did you refuse him ?" she questioned, as the flush&#xD;
deepened and frightened.&#xD;
"I believe I did!" I responded, all pain and anxiety&#xD;
leaving me as hope arose.&#xD;
"That is sufficient!." said Miss Cardover, rising with ~in&#xD;
abrupt and proud gesture. "If you cannot appreciate him,&#xD;
Kate, I am very sorry for you!" She hastily quitted the&#xD;
room, and left me standing there. I closed the door, and&#xD;
sat down in an arm.ehair so infinitely proud and humble in&#xD;
my joy: grateful tears welled from my heart: I had this&#xD;
night learned from his sister's manner and words that Mr.&#xD;
Cardover's happiness had suffered. Now I believed that he&#xD;
had avoided me because even his strong pride ~ould not as-&#xD;
sume a careless lightness. I remained alone as long as I&#xD;
dared, and then went down stairs. Walter came to me, and&#xD;
conducted me to a seat by an open window that led out on&#xD;
the piazza.&#xD;
"To-morrow, Kate," he said, "III shall be on the ocean.&#xD;
When I am gone, will you remember that you have promised&#xD;
to be a sister to Effie?"&#xD;
"Yes, I will!" I replied, looking in his kind, grave eyes.&#xD;
I always loved him best when lie threw aside his jesting&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"You have kept our meeting at the South a secret?" he&#xD;
asked, inquiringly.&#xD;
"Yes, certainly, Walter!" I replied.&#xD;
At this very instant Mr. Cardover stepped in from the&#xD;
piazza. He looked directly at us, as if to let us knew that&#xD;
he had overheard our conversation. His look was almost&#xD;
reproachful. I could not forbear gazing in his beloved eyes&#xD;
.-..he turned away, but not, before an expression of boundless&#xD;
tenderness had met me. He did not ask me to dance,&#xD;
bridesmaid though I was, neither did he lead me to supper;&#xD;
&#xD;
TW~ RAPPY TRANCE.                343&#xD;
and when accidentally I ine~ him in the course of the even-&#xD;
ing, he turned away with a hastily averted head, and sought&#xD;
a distant place. I djd not mind this now: Ii thought and&#xD;
cared not how a reconciliation was to occur: I knew it would&#xD;
come, and I left the manner of it to God, trusting in Him,&#xD;
even as the little birds do. It gave me joy that Mr. Car-&#xD;
dover avoided me, now that I saw pride was not the most&#xD;
powerful incentive to it: it was a strong and noble principle:&#xD;
he believed Walter clainmd me.&#xD;
Gertrude and I went home with Grace and Mr. Waldron.&#xD;
James Bedell accompanied Gertrude; the next morning he&#xD;
was to leave f4~r the South. As soon as I could, I stole to&#xD;
the pretty chamber designed for me: I left Gertrude and&#xD;
James in the parlor; it. did not make me feel lonely now to&#xD;
see James's eyes turn fondly to little 0-erty: child though she&#xD;
seemed, she was unusually mature in character.&#xD;
The gray dawn broke crc I had closed my eyes in slum-&#xD;
her. II lay in a bright, happy trance, and some spiritual&#xD;
affinity assured n~e that he of whom I dreamed, was less&#xD;
miserable than before. The street door closed softly, and&#xD;
Gertrude entered the chamber: I kept my eyes shut, as she&#xD;
bent over and looked at me; but at last I broke into&#xD;
laughter.&#xD;
"Oh, Kate, don't tell mother I sat up so late!7~ she&#xD;
~aid, beseechingly, "but you know it was half past two when&#xD;
we left the party."&#xD;
Her lovely, girlish face was brilliant with feeling.&#xD;
"1\{ethinks that is a diamond ring?" I said, seizing the&#xD;
white finger upon which it glistened.&#xD;
"Methinks it is!" she responded, clasping both hands&#xD;
over her blushing face.&#xD;
"And methinks James gave it to thee?"&#xD;
"Methinks he did 1" she answered, from behind her&#xD;
screen.&#xD;

&#xD;
"And methinks thou art engaged to him?"&#xD;
"Methinks IL am!"&#xD;
"Oh, Gerty, what a child! And you'i'e very happy?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Well, take my sage advice, and put off getting married&#xD;
until you are twenty, or at least ~s long as James will gait.&#xD;
For it is an natural thing not to have any girlhood: it is&#xD;
always regretted, even by the happiest wives who ha~ e been&#xD;
too early married. Now cOme to bed, and let us see if we&#xD;
can't catch a little sleep before breakfast time."&#xD;
It was half past eight when we presented ourselves iii&#xD;
the breakfast-room. Gertrude hurried to school: Mr. Wal-&#xD;
dron took up his hat to go, and I hastened up stairs, coifsid-&#xD;
ering 'what an event a daily " good-bye" is between a newly&#xD;
wedded pair. I made the bed, brushed up the room, threw&#xD;
open the windows, and beguiled the time in putting au extra&#xD;
flourish on my hair, after which IL sa down, and had a little&#xD;
reverie. Then IL went down, and en ered Grace's little bou-&#xD;
doir, sure that her husband had gone&#xD;
" Once more, little pearl!" said Mr. Waldron, as IL en-&#xD;
tered, with his hand under Grate's chin, The young wife&#xD;
laughed, and kissed him once more. They turned and ~aw&#xD;
me; I h~d not known whether to ad ance or retreat.&#xD;
"Oh~ dear!" IL exclaimed, "ho embarrassing this is!&#xD;
I am sure I stayed up stairs a great ~ hile!"&#xD;
"Well, Kitty,. we can't help it " said Mr. Waldron,&#xD;
laughing.j " Good-bye ! Good-bye ! " He seized his hat,&#xD;
and made his exit forthwith. Then Grace and I sat down in&#xD;
the lovely little boudoh~ to have a quiet day to ourselves.&#xD;
It looked so cheery, so delicious: we each' had a vci'y cun-&#xD;
ning little rocking-chair, in which we seated oi~irselves to em-&#xD;
broider 'muslins. Tn common, with all brides, Grace had&#xD;
finished up all her plain sewing, so that she was put to her&#xD;
wits-end for a change of work. The little alabaster clock&#xD;
&#xD;
ticked, as II told all my heart to Grace, and blushed to say&#xD;
how great my suffering had been, when under the impression&#xD;
that she returned Mr. Cardover's partiality.&#xD;
"Oh, Kitty! Kitty Hamilton!" she exclaimed. "What&#xD;
an idea; Pliny never cared at all for me!"&#xD;
"Why, Grace, what makes you think so&#xD;
"Because I know it. I saw that he had a preference for&#xD;
you; I used to wonder at your indifference!"&#xD;
"But, Grace, don't you remember at Blooming Hill how&#xD;
he spo~e so low to you at the window, and how he bent over&#xD;
your ~hair, while you blushed, and looked exactly as if he&#xD;
was talking love to you?" Ii blushed to the tips of my ears&#xD;
at this agonizing reminiscencQ-Such it had always been.&#xD;
Grace thought a moment, and then clapped her hands at re~&#xD;
collecting the circumstance.&#xD;
"He was teasing me about Horace, you little, miserable*&#xD;
darling! And did all your coldness to him at that time&#xD;
spring from that?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"ill think he began to fancy you about the time of that&#xD;
visit for a wife. lie always seemed to take you under his&#xD;
charge in a~ measure.~~&#xD;
"IL think h9 might have liked me instead of Judith&#xD;
Morton."&#xD;
" Oh, don't be too monopolizing, Kitty! He fancied a&#xD;
heavenly soul was enframed in Judith's beautiful form. He&#xD;
loved her as Ii loved Mr. Benzoni, only not to that extent.&#xD;
He realizes that she was only a shadow of beauty."&#xD;
"'But, Grace, IL certainly overheard Miss Cardover say,&#xD;
the other day, that her brother would marry me to-morrow,&#xD;
if he could get up the same kind of feeling for me he had&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"Well, she meant her brother Seth, of course!" said&#xD;

&#xD;
Grace, laughing, and looking at me as if she wondered how&#xD;
I had managed to mystify myself to such a degree.&#xD;
"Oh, I never thought *of him!" I answered. "I had&#xD;
always fancied that he was an admirer of our Effie."&#xD;
"You did? It has been perfectly clear to me that he&#xD;
has been halting between you and Eflie for six weeks-.&#xD;
looking first at one, then at the other. I suppose he thinks&#xD;
you are the smartest, and Effie is the prettiest."&#xD;
"Grace, is it possible that I have endured so much suf-&#xD;
fering during a year or two for nothing?" I questioned.&#xD;
"All my misery has hinged upon a simple mistake."&#xD;
"Tt is even so, dear Kate. Your case is not peculiar;&#xD;
we always grieve about that which proves a blessing in the&#xD;
end. I suffered on account of a mistaken idea that Mr.&#xD;
Benzoni could make me happy-Pliny suffered through his&#xD;
illusive idea of Judith. Walter also. The sweet sorrow&#xD;
has done its work for us, so it matters not what occasioned&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"But then, Grace," I said, "it seems rather provoking&#xD;
to have dwelt in the caverns of despair, when we might just&#xD;
as well have been Sporting in the sunshine.~~&#xD;
"Not just as well," responded Grace, smiling. "The&#xD;
caverns of despair did for us w~hat the sunshine could~ not&#xD;
have done."&#xD;
"Yes, I believe!" I returned.&#xD;
"When are you going to set Pliny's mind at ease?"&#xD;
asked Grace.&#xD;
"Why, I think he will seek me again, when he sees 1~hat&#xD;
I treat him differently from what I did."&#xD;
"Sit down to that table and write to him all about itt,"&#xD;
said the young wife, with an air of wisdom and authority)&#xD;
" No, I can't!"&#xD;
"Why not?" she asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SUMMER-HOUSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"II don't exactly like to. I would rather he should seek&#xD;
me again himself."&#xD;
"You are proud still, Kate! But your lofty head will&#xD;
come down when you ask Pliny's pardon for all your follies&#xD;
-they must look to him very much like coquetries. Per-&#xD;
haps you may not see him again alone for a long time: he&#xD;
will probably be at Father Waldron's next Wednesday even-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
- "A groomsman cannot be absent from bridal parties very&#xD;
wcll."&#xD;
The next Wednesday a festal throng gathered in the&#xD;
stone house at Blooming Hill: many intimate friends and&#xD;
relatives went from Boston to spend the day. In the even-&#xD;
ing a more formal company was expected. As the twilight&#xD;
shadows came down, I suddenly thought II would go to the&#xD;
flower garden, and tiny green-house, and weave two wreaths,&#xD;
one for Grace and one for myself. I desired to look as well&#xD;
as II could; the sweetest blossoms of hope lay in their fresh-&#xD;
ness on my soul, and it seemed no mockery to twine tender&#xD;
flowers about my head. So I sought the flowers I needed,&#xD;
and went to the summer.'house to form them into a wreath:&#xD;
I had not long been at work, when Grace espied me from the&#xD;
piazza.. She did not come to me, but ere long Pliny* Cardo-&#xD;
ver did. He wore the same grave face that I had seen for&#xD;
weeks, as he bowed and said,&#xD;
"Grace asked me to come for you, Miss Kate."&#xD;
"Oh, thank you!" I, had just completed my wreath,&#xD;
and I laid it around my head. "See! is this completely irre-&#xD;
sistible?" I asked, looking - in his eyes with a smile: the&#xD;
sadness on his countenance instantly fled, and he looked&#xD;
down on me with a smile so radiant in its deep tenderness, -&#xD;
that my gaze dropped to the ground: rich floods of happiness&#xD;
swept into my soul, wave rose trembling upon wave, until my&#xD;
heart was full: I could comprehend no more. I believed&#xD;

&#xD;
that to him I was beautiful and bright, although to the many,&#xD;
I might be one to be passed by with careless look.&#xD;
"It is chilly. Shall we go in?" asked Mr. Cardover,&#xD;
with a returii to his former cold manner. He wa~ so distant,&#xD;
that the frankness on my tongue was stayed-I desired ugain&#xD;
to hear pleading words on that stern lip.&#xD;
"Please wait one second until II ~et Grace's wreath," I&#xD;
said. " Isn't that lovely?" and I held it up. " NOW let us&#xD;
go." Ii gathered up my white di~ess and ran on before him&#xD;
to the house.&#xD;
Grace stood in the hail: I placed the wreath upon her&#xD;
gracefully shaped head.&#xD;
"Thank you, Kitty!" said Mr. Waidron, gazing upon&#xD;
his wife, as if I~cr loveliness drew his heart away; then he&#xD;
turned from her, as if by an effort of will, and strove to&#xD;
direct his attention to his par guests. It was very hard&#xD;
to enter into commonplace conversation with the friends&#xD;
around me, and yet I went from one to another and spoke&#xD;
some cordial words-each one little knew how my whole be-&#xD;
ing overflowed with love and blessing, and how I wished I&#xD;
could draw down such a bright shower fi~om Paradise to re-&#xD;
fresh the world-weary souls gathered in those ancient rooms&#xD;
Wherever I moved I was conscious that dark eyes followed&#xD;
me, and that a manly heart was pondering whether it had&#xD;
again been duped by woman. It seemed t6 me that I dis-&#xD;
tinc~ly comprehended the moments, when that heart yielded&#xD;
to supreme confldence~in me, and when doubt and wonder&#xD;
swayed it. I did not l~ok towards him, but his sudden smile&#xD;
and expression of co~mtenance in the summer-house had&#xD;
given me the key to his nature and his love.&#xD;
I stood a moment alone. M~. Cardover came to my&#xD;
side. "Kate, let me speak with you! " he said, offering his&#xD;
arm. He took me to the piazza, which was entirely secluded;&#xD;
the lights from the drawing-room shed a dancing brilliance&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the vines that closed in the piazza. We paced up and&#xD;
down several times before Mr. Cardover spoke. At length&#xD;
he asked abruptly,&#xD;
"Are you engaged to Walter?"&#xD;
"No!" I answered, and my heart began to beat very&#xD;
fast.&#xD;
"He went to see you when you were at the South?" he&#xD;
continued, and then I felt his eyes upon me searchingly, and&#xD;
I knew that the doubt was in his heart. My heart trembled&#xD;
and rose up in my throat, so that I could not instantly&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"He visited you at the South, did he not?" he repeated,&#xD;
with an accent of sternness, and his look was still upon me.&#xD;
"He came where I was by accident," I said.&#xD;
"Did he know you were there when he came?"&#xD;
"No! hut he wished our meeting kept secret; this was&#xD;
for no reason dishonorable to Walter."&#xD;
"You may not know his reason for keeping it secret."&#xD;
"Yes, I know it, and I approve of it," I said.&#xD;
"I have no right to ask you whether you have a prefer-&#xD;
ence for Walter," Mr. Cardover said.&#xD;
"I have not!" I answered.&#xD;
"Did you tell me truth the other night, Kate, before you&#xD;
left me?" his low voice trembled. "Was it only t6 see&#xD;
how much my love would bear, that you have "-he stopped,&#xD;
but his tremulous cadence thrilled through me. "Are you&#xD;
ofily wilful, Kate?"&#xD;
I did not answer or look up,. for the beating of my l~art&#xD;
was too great for speed.&#xD;
"Don't ~ou care for me a little, dearest?" he took my&#xD;
hand. and perused my face, oh, how lovingly, I knew, although&#xD;
I did not see the look.&#xD;
A gay and laughing group came out on the piazza, and&#xD;

we followed the promenades up and down silently.&#xD;
"Will you ride home with Elizabeth and me?" ques-&#xD;
tioned Mr. Cardover, after a long pause.&#xD;
"J agreed to stay all night here," II answered.&#xD;
"When shall you be home?"&#xD;

ent with Miss Cardover the night before: when she mi&#xD;
us at the door, I saw that she was agitated. She follows&#xD;
me to my room, which she had shared since Grace's ma&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
"What is it, Effie?" I asked, sitting down.&#xD;
"Mr. Seth Cardover has made me an offer of marriage&#xD;
she answered, lowering her eyes.&#xD;
"Well!" I said, laying aside my bonnet and shawl, at&#xD;
thinking, as II looked at he~', how angelically beautiful si&#xD;
was. What a contrast to Mr. S~th's homely appearance.&#xD;
"What shall I do?" she asked, looking at me in a&#xD;
fectly childlike manner.&#xD;
"What do you want to do, Effle?"&#xD;
"I think," she said, sighing, and she looked like a&#xD;
defined prisoner, "that Walter would like to have me ma&#xD;
ned to some respectable man. Often when he has looked&#xD;
me, I have felt that I was a care to him."&#xD;
She covered her face with her hands,~ and wept quietly.&#xD;
"Could you love Mr. Cardover?"&#xD;
"Perhaps I could, if I should try very hard. I dot&#xD;

TIlE DESOLATE REART.&#xD;
&#xD;
Would you be willing to marry him, loving him so little,&#xD;
Effie ?"&#xD;
"I would, to make Walter at ease about me. I don't&#xD;
think, dear Kate, that Walter has any fear for me, only a&#xD;
kind of anxiety as to what will become of me. II can never&#xD;
marry any but some matter-of-fact widower, because I never&#xD;
could tell my story to any-to one whom I could love and&#xD;
look up to with all my soul. I think it would not be a great&#xD;
sin to marry Mr. Cardover, feeling as I do-because,-be-&#xD;
cause I think he does not love me so very deeply." She&#xD;
dropped down on her knees beside me, and laid her head on&#xD;
my lap with such passionate, heart-breaking weeping.&#xD;
"Oh, Katy! kiss me-hold your arms around me tightly.&#xD;
Jam so unhappy!"&#xD;
"Why, Effie?" I laid my cheek on hers, and held her&#xD;
trembling hands.&#xD;
"I can never love again! I am sacrificed! so young!"&#xD;
She lookcd~up prayingly through the brimming tears.&#xD;
"But you need not marry him, dear."&#xD;
"If I do not marry, and my history should become&#xD;
known, every body would shun nie,-but if I were his wife it&#xD;
would be different. And, Katy, I might hive a precious&#xD;
child to love. Oh! I would give it my~ soul,.-my life! My&#xD;
baby was four weeks old when it died-and I loved it-loved.&#xD;
it-.loved it! I would have died for it,-would have been&#xD;
buried in unknown places all my life with it. God took it&#xD;
from me. it thought he meant to kill me with ten thousand&#xD;
deaths when that last agony came, and I was left perishing&#xD;
alone in this great world. I die to think of it! Oh! kiss&#xD;
me again, Katy!"&#xD;
I clasped her close to my heart with speechless sobs.&#xD;
"And I loved him," she whispered, shuddering. "It&#xD;
was a dream, Katy-JI was so weak, and he drew me away&#xD;
from God, from every thing-and I never dreamed where he&#xD;

"If what, Effle?"&#xD;
"If I had not overheard Mrs. henry praying to him, in&#xD;
a votce of anguish, to speak one kind word to her. He left&#xD;
her with rude and cruel speech-and her sobs smote me so.&#xD;
I knew then that she was good and loving, and that II stood&#xD;
in God's presence a lost, abandoned sinner. II fled that day."&#xD;
"And since then, darling Eflie, you have been trying to&#xD;
be one of God's innocent angels-and He has kept you in his&#xD;
arms, and you will wander hand in hand with the pure in&#xD;
heaven."&#xD;
"Oh, yes! Katy, will I ?" Her blue eyes looked up.&#xD;
"Yes, precious sister. And have you been so unhappy&#xD;
all the time you hayc been here?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! but when Mr. (Jardover asked me in a letter to&#xD;
be his wife, the great gulf of the past opened, as if to swallow&#xD;
me up in its darkness. And oh! to have a heart, Katy, and&#xD;
not to be able to love with it."&#xD;
"Efile, sweetest, don't marry him-don't give away the&#xD;
freedom of your heart: don't make this pitiable effort to&#xD;
twine your affections about him." Ii could not bear to see&#xD;
her beauteous youthfulness calmly laid upon a cold altar.&#xD;
She lay with her head upon my knee, giving way to thought.&#xD;
"Is he good, Katy?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Kind?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"He is a man of sense, Katy, although his looks are&#xD;
against him?"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly."&#xD;
"Do you think in time he would learn to love me very&#xD;
much?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear, I know he would."&#xD;

THE RSOLVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And do you think I could make huin happy, oh! if I&#xD;
tried w~th my whole heart, 4nd prayed every morning and&#xD;
night to do so?"&#xD;
"Yes, you might, Effie."&#xD;
"I would make it my life's work; oh! it almost seen~s&#xD;
now as if somO heavenly kindness came into my heart for&#xD;
him. Would it be a wasted life an4 heart, thus to devote&#xD;
myself to making his existence brighter?"&#xD;
"Why, no; I suppose not," I said, catching the hope&#xD;
that looked from her eyes.&#xD;
"And, although I know I ought not to think I can have&#xD;
much influence, still I would try ~o hard to strengthen his&#xD;
hands in every good work-and to make his soul purer; as it&#xD;
nears heaven. And would he not stay my fainting strength&#xD;
upon God too?"&#xD;
"Yes, he is sincerely religious and high principled. lie&#xD;
is really one of those who will be far handsomer in the Spirit&#xD;
land than here. I suppose we think far too much upon looks&#xD;
and manner."&#xD;
"Oh! tell me, shall I have him', Katy?"&#xD;
I buried my face in my hands~ in profoundest thought.&#xD;
There seemed something lofty, something heroic in this de-&#xD;
votion of a young and exquisitely beautiful woman to the&#xD;
etubellishnient of a plain, homely life. I never could for' a&#xD;
moment think of Effie as one who.had sinned so deeply. She&#xD;
always stood before me as innocent, deeply loving, cruelly&#xD;
wronged-one whose God had stooped down to redeem her&#xD;
from the wolf-dog's lacerating teeth. And yet I dared not&#xD;
advise her.&#xD;
"I cannot say, Effie. Do as your heart impels you."&#xD;
"Then, Katy, my lot is fixed. I will be his wife, if lie&#xD;
can take me, after learning all."&#xD;
"When does he expect an answer?"&#xD;
"To-day."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CONFESSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
855&#xD;
&#xD;
"To-day '~"&#xD;
"Yes; 11 think he is waiting for me now. I heard the&#xD;
street door close a moment ago."&#xD;
Josephine came in and confirmed the supposition, and&#xD;
then tripped singing away; never dreaming of the heart&#xD;
within her, some day to be awakened.&#xD;
"Will you take what I shall write down to him, Kate,&#xD;
and bring me back his answer?"&#xD;
She took up a pencil with a heavy sigh, and wrote a few&#xD;
lines, adding at the end, "If you still think me worthy of&#xD;
being your wife, I will be so; if not, keep my secret for&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
II took down the note: h~ looked up eagerly, expecting&#xD;
to see the lovely face of Effle. I handed him the letter, say-&#xD;
ing, "Read it, if you please, and tell me whether you wish to&#xD;
think about it."&#xD;
He read it; the crimson blood mounted to his forehead.&#xD;
"Come back hi an hour," he said. I went back. "Have&#xD;
yoi~&amp;amp; read it?" he asked; his face was a shade paler.&#xD;
"Yes," Ii answered.&#xD;
"You know the whole?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"What do you think of her?" he asked, watching me&#xD;
closely.&#xD;
"I love her:"&#xD;
"How old was she at the time?"&#xD;
"Seventeen."&#xD;
"She had no mother?"&#xD;
" No."&#xD;
"You love her?"&#xD;
"Yes, very deeply. She is now better worth than mil-&#xD;
lions of hackneyed, fashionable women."&#xD;

HlUM~AN NATURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Will you tell her I repeat my Olicr~ and ask her to&#xD;
come down?"&#xD;
I hastened to Effie, who sat by the little dressing-table,&#xD;
her head bowed upon her folded arms. Her face was white&#xD;
as death, so terrible ~as the exposition of her sin.&#xD;
Oh, if you could go with me! " she said. " I-low ccta&#xD;
T meet him?"&#xD;
"It will soon be over, Effie, and then it will be buried&#xD;
in eternal oblivion."&#xD;
She trembled violently. I put my aruf around her, and&#xD;
went down to the parlor door with her, for she hung back,&#xD;
and I had no faith in stretching out the misery by procras-&#xD;
tination. She went in, and I started up stairs, but I hoard&#xD;
a fall, and hurried into the parlor.. She lay sensel6ss and&#xD;
white upon the floor, while Seth Cardover bent over her&#xD;
with an expression of feeling and pity, which I thanked him&#xD;
for. He lifted up her lovely head, and put bank the ring-&#xD;
lets with kind, caressing fingers: a shower of~ tears fell upon&#xD;
her pallid face. Ii took a pitcher of water from the table,&#xD;
and bathed her temples~-tben saturated my handkerchief&#xD;
with it, and laid it upon the back of her neck. She opened&#xD;
her eyes, and painfully returned to consciousness. Seth&#xD;
Cardover carried her to the sofa: she looked in his pycs.&#xD;
"God help me to shield you, poor dove!" he said, ten-&#xD;
derly laying her head upon his shoulder. She half hid her&#xD;
face, and wept. I[ left the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
AN hour or two passed, and then Effie came back to our&#xD;
chamber. Ji looked anxiously at her. She did not look&#xD;
happy, but I saw that her heart was eased of its terrible&#xD;
weight: a pitiful resignation was on her meek face. She&#xD;
was that ~ay giving up the vision that cleaves to every hu-&#xD;
man soul: she was resigning the hope of an exquisitely con-&#xD;
genial heart-a dim hope this oft may be, living in the in-&#xD;
most recesses of the spirit, perhaps rarely acknowledged by&#xD;
some, yet at a betrothal hour it rises to perception with an-&#xD;
guished consciousness, if tile pair are not suited to each&#xD;
other. This is more particularly the case with women, who&#xD;
do not select, but are selected, and this feeling is consistent&#xD;
with a measure of attachment. The realization of a mighty&#xD;
loss sweeps vaguely over the soul, at the ver~r moment a fair&#xD;
hand is laid within the strong palm of o~e who may be&#xD;
dearer than others-yet he may not be the one out of all the&#xD;
universe who was created for that trembling betrothed.&#xD;
"Has Mr. Cardover gone, Effie?"&#xD;
"No, I ant going to ride with him," she answered slowly.&#xD;
She looked like a marble statue, as she leaned 'against the&#xD;
bed.&#xD;
"Sit down a moment, dear Eflie, you look so pale."&#xD;
"I will not keep him waiting," she ans~er&amp;amp;d in the same&#xD;

calm way. "I will be literally careful of his wishes. I am&#xD;
a woman without a heart, Kate, or else it is fearfully be-&#xD;
numbed. It is terrible, but I do not realize it-I[ have no&#xD;
feeling." She put on her bonnet; as she looked in the glass&#xD;
more from habit than solicitude about her appearance, she&#xD;
said, "How cold and stony I look!"&#xD;
"It is a reaction of feeling, Effle; it will pass away.&#xD;
Have you told Mr. Cardover bow you feel ?"&#xD;
"No, but I a~ going to as we ride. I &amp;amp;an be honest,&#xD;
if not loving. I feel as if I am committing a great wrong&#xD;
to-day----there is cold gulf between him and me. Some-&#xD;
thing impels me to marry him; and then something holy and&#xD;
solemn tells me that the deep sea between us can never be&#xD;
crossed;"&#xD;
"Oh, what a strange world this is 1 I wonder if it is&#xD;
sinful for you to inarr~ him; Thile?"&#xD;
"I will let him d~ cide," she said, and she left me. Ii&#xD;
felt for her the most intense and yearning pity, the more so,&#xD;
as every recess of my 4irit was yielding an affirmative to a&#xD;
beloved one: the cold surface of restraint which I had im-&#xD;
posed upon myself (and which had quelled not only all ex-&#xD;
pression, but all thought of Pliny Cardover) was melting&#xD;
away, and I kneeled in floods of love; trembling under the&#xD;
new baptism-trembling lest this overflowing love should&#xD;
speak forth in every utterance of my being, untempered by&#xD;
the chaste reserve which is a woman's dower.&#xD;
I expected Pliny, or a letter from him, and as I devoted&#xD;
my attention to my toilett, I listened to hear the knocker.&#xD;
With what a new satisfaction I[ rolled over the ringlets of&#xD;
my hair, knowing that Pliny cared for them. Perhaps it&#xD;
was vanity, but I did not care; I could joyfully give up the&#xD;
admiring eyes of the world for his glance. I looked with&#xD;
folded hands upon my gallery of dresses: finally I selected&#xD;
a delicate blue gingham, and donned it, with a little em-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
broidered collar embellishing it at the throat, and' cuffs of&#xD;
the same pattern. Then II put on a little black silk apron,&#xD;
bedizzened with Brussels lace and velvet trimming: a cam-&#xD;
bric handkerchief peeped from one of the lace pockets, and&#xD;
some sweet clover blossoms from the other. I had just&#xD;
given a last, satisfied glance at myself when the knocker&#xD;
sounded. Ii hurried down stairs. At the door stood a boy&#xD;
with a letter, inquiring if Miss Kate Hamilton was at home.&#xD;
I took the letter, recognized the writing, and started up&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
"Oh, miss," cried the boy, " Mr. Cardover said I was'&#xD;
to wait and see if you would send an answer.~~&#xD;
"Sit down-I will," I replied. II reached my room, and&#xD;
read.&#xD;
"DEAR KATE,-I have just i'eturned from Blooming&#xD;
Hill, but I cannot rest without writing to you. Your low&#xD;
replies are trembling through my inmost heart. You look&#xD;
into my eyes until ~you bear my soul away, or droop your&#xD;
gaze as if you would not let me see your heart. How many&#xD;
times have I read in that sudden drooping 'all your love is&#xD;
returned.' Could you trifle with me, Kate? How could&#xD;
you turn from such wealth of idolatry? from a human soul,&#xD;
priceless iu the eye of God; yet yielded to your slight hand,&#xD;
without power to free itself? I have sometimes thought&#xD;
d~ai, when you have turned from me with a kind of trem-&#xD;

handling. Ah! how little do you understand how love soft-&#xD;
ens man's strong nature. If-and it is hard for me to be-&#xD;

strii~gs, only to learn how many tones they may give ~out,&#xD;
then, even then, you shall hear no reproaches from me-the&#xD;

360              THE DRAMA OF LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
fling aside every restraint upon your liberty-that you even&#xD;
looked with a sort of rebellion upon marriage. Was it so,&#xD;
Katy? At such times, too, you strove to avoid me with a&#xD;
passionate coldness, sometimes with starting tears. I would&#xD;
not blame you for this, Katy-I would not blame you 'for&#xD;
any thing. I would only hold you close against my beast&#xD;
when storms come--would only soothe and comfort you,&#xD;
when your heart grew faint, and your feet trembled along&#xD;
the difficult earth-paths. But, oh! how much less must&#xD;
your love be than mine, if aught can balance against it. No&#xD;
wisdom or foresight can evade the clouds that ofttimes beset&#xD;
our life. Cares there are-sufferings there arc! No situa-&#xD;
tion is free from them-but happiness is rare. Who would&#xD;
not choose it, ev~en if certain that shadows might follow the&#xD;
sunshine, rather than lead a tame life, ~yhen it would still be&#xD;
subject to the visits of the tormentor~-the regenerator-&#xD;
4ain? But these thoughts that I have chronicled here,&#xD;
have never been more than transient with me. I have&#xD;
thought that I[ have read deeper into Katy's heart-have&#xD;
felt that she could look up to God with faith, and see a di-&#xD;
vine benevolence, while weeping beneath the Smiter's haxid.&#xD;
iii have thought there mnst be some strong rea~o~~,to inc un-&#xD;
known, for your rejection of my love. I[ ~m not able to be-&#xD;
lieve there was perfect trtith in those cruel, sadly spoken&#xD;
words, 'Not well enough to marry you.' Be frank with me,&#xD;
I entreat! If there is any right cause why our lives should&#xD;
be divided on earth, do you fear me, Katy? Do you know&#xD;
me so little as to suppose I would not be the first to&#xD;
strengthen you in all that is just and true? My love com-&#xD;
prehends your soul's deepest well-being. I could bear that&#xD;
our earthly lives should run apart,~ Kate, eternally b9lovcd-&#xD;
wife. I should obey truth and duty, rather than an impuh~e&#xD;
for happiness.-....life is an heroic drama. I would not that you,&#xD;
more than myself, should fail in heavenly duty. I would not&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MYSTERY.                 3(31&#xD;
that you should love me beyond Godlike right-but next to&#xD;
it-...-clasped with all that is holiest, mightiest, deepest in hu-&#xD;
man souls. But I feel, beloved, that there exists no obsta~&#xD;
ole great enough to separate u~. Alas! if the yielding love&#xD;
in your face so brief a time since, ,is but to be followed by&#xD;
another wayward flight. I will not believe it. What is&#xD;
this mystery in your demeanor, Kate? ilave you not some-&#xD;
times as really cast yourself into my heart, as if my arm&#xD;
had enfolded you? Do you remember that gay evening at&#xD;
your house, when Ii led you out to dance? It was then that&#xD;
hope arose within me; and when~cametoyou the*next&#xD;
day and gave you white roses, I thought a blessed' affirma-&#xD;
tion, reached me from you. The cloud passed from my hori-&#xD;
zon, and-&#xD;
'Life was lik~ a sunset's glories blended&#xD;
*         With all the waking splendors of the morn.'&#xD;
"But you went from me-falteringly. It passed through&#xD;
my thoughts that you were engaged' to Walter. When I&#xD;
overheard his words to you soon after, I thought I had the&#xD;
key to your varying conduct. I thought I read your love&#xD;
for me, in the beseeching gaze that prayed against coldness&#xD;
or sternness. I thought that it was your destiny to become&#xD;
Walter's wife, and that it was mine to dwell far from you&#xD;
through an eternity of time. But here I was mistaken, and&#xD;
mystery pursues me still. Do you remember when we went&#xD;
to Blooming ilill, more than a year ago? I had learned to&#xD;
love you before that time-there you turned from me--&#xD;
away-away! Then Ii became aware that my every hope&#xD;
was allied to you, and I ,suffered, while my pride assumed a&#xD;
careless demeanor. Then I did not think that same pride&#xD;
could kneel to you as it has since done: then I had' not&#xD;
learned' my full capacity of loving. When you went South&#xD;
we parted without one kind farewell--one loving glance.&#xD;

&#xD;
THEs APPEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Even, then, I doubted sometimes if you cared so little for&#xD;
my heart throbs. Often, when in fancy I saw you in your&#xD;
Southern home, have I felt that your eyes tui-ned tearfully&#xD;
to me-so thrilling, 'so livig was. the feelhig, that I have&#xD;
scores of times written long letters to you, to be destroyed&#xD;
in different moments. Beloved Kate ! shall I not now take&#xD;
your hand in mine ? Do you fear that I shall be severe ?-&#xD;
that I shall not be tender enough at dl times ? that I shall&#xD;
guide you over hard places in my allegiance to duity ? Teach&#xD;
mec then' to cling to truth with woman's more vine-like hold!&#xD;
Clasp about my nature the gracious flowers of tenderness !&#xD;
I know that I have a' stern, unyielding spirit. -I scarcely&#xD;
dare~ believe that the future contains a joy so divie as the&#xD;
union of our destinies. I scarcely dare hope that I shall&#xD;
see you within a blessed home of mine, that I shall conie to&#xD;
you from the toils of the day, rind dream that God's heaven&#xD;
has conie dow to refresh this outer world. And yet I do&#xD;
hope for all ti is. Do you not believe in a presentiment of&#xD;
another's spiritual presence ? iDo you not think that one&#xD;
person may so intensely think of another who is beloved,&#xD;
as to draw the other's thoughts towards him ? Have I not&#xD;
seeni you conscious of this ? unable almost to break from&#xD;
me when you would-almost powerless in the detaining grasp&#xD;
of my affection ? Has not my soul affected you when it has&#xD;
turned to you with the strength of hope or suffering ? Act&#xD;
as you will, speak what you will, I have learned your, secret&#xD;
at last : you are mine own,, my wife-for you love me. Tell&#xD;
me all your heart ; tell me why you have turned away from&#xD;
me. I will have a tender care over your soul-f will watch&#xD;
its increasing beauty, and when the material case that en-&#xD;
closes it shall have fallen to dust, I will meet you in God's-&#xD;
time in that upper world, where I shall behold you in all&#xD;
your fresh angelic loveliness. Beloved Katy ! come to me&#xD;

A BRIEF LETTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
363&#xD;
&#xD;
':Again I feel the wish intense and burning,&#xD;
To live within thy ifre, to drink thine air;-&#xD;
.That deep, mysterious, and mghty yearttoing ttee&#xD;
" Write to me one line ! Decide our fate now-! I can&#xD;
bear no farther suspense. -Tell me that you love me !&#xD;
I gazed upon the letter like one entranced. I kissed it,&#xD;
and held it to my heart. More than all I loved him because&#xD;
he said, " I could bear that our earthly lives should run&#xD;
aart." I loved him because he was strong enough to choose&#xD;
the strictest path o~ right, rather than the flowery one of&#xD;
happiness, if the two paths could not merge in one. Isaw&#xD;
in this a strength that would yield to' no temptation, that&#xD;
would hold me up in heavenly rectitude, when my cowardly&#xD;
heart would pray to take an easier road.&#xD;
I suddenly recollected the boy wvho was waiting. in te&#xD;
hall, and seizing a pencil, I wrote-&#xD;
&#xD;
"DEAR PIN,-Come to me !&#xD;

II hastened down stairs with my note, and then sought&#xD;
myroom to read again the beloved' letter. When I had&#xD;
read it many times, I slowly folded it, wondering if it was&#xD;
I, whose life had been changed to this golden existence. I&#xD;
looked in the glas; there I was, but transfigured under the&#xD;
delicious breath of love, hope, joy !&#xD;
I went to the parlor. I had not been seated five mninute8&#xD;

THE hEART'S AVOWAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
I lay' sobbing on his breast, while his dear f~ice bent above&#xD;
me, and his voice murmured tenderest words.&#xD;
"You give yourself to nfe now, Katy?" he tremulously&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"For this life?"&#xD;
"Yes," I repeated.&#xD;
"For eternity, also, beloved?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
"Do you love me with your whole heart, Katy ? "'&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
He gently lifted up my head, and sealed upon my lips a&#xD;
first trembling kiss. "Do you realize that our betrothal is&#xD;
being solemnized in presence of the Infinite?" he asked&#xD;
with reverent, thrilling accent.&#xD;
"Oh, yes!" II said, as a holy illumination beamed around&#xD;
my soul, and seemed to turn it heavenward.&#xD;
"Now sit down with me, Katy, and 'tell me of the past."&#xD;
We sat down on the sofa, but for a long, long time we&#xD;
were speechless. My head lay against his shoulder, and his&#xD;
gaze dwelt upon me. At length I told him how faithless&#xD;
and how foolish I[ had been; and IL did not fear to tell him&#xD;
all my soul.&#xD;
"Are you going South again to teach, Katy?" he&#xD;
asked, bending over with a smile.&#xD;
"Shall I?" I responded, meeting his look With an an-&#xD;
swering smile.&#xD;
"No ! "&#xD;
"Then II will not," I said.&#xD;
A carriage drove up to the door. "It is Effie and your&#xD;
brother," I exclaimed, going to the window. WMn I saw&#xD;
Mr. Seth Ca~dover hand out tenderly the pale ERIe, the in-&#xD;
tense ~pity again swept into my soul. Mr.. Seth drove away,&#xD;

&#xD;
THE DECISION.&#xD;
&#xD;
365&#xD;
&#xD;
and the light, slow tread of Efile was heard mounting the&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
"Is it possible, Kate," asked Pliny, "that a beautiful&#xD;
atid attractive girl like Eflie can love my brother, who is&#xD;
twice her age, and-he does not seem fitted to please her."&#xD;
"I presume it is settled by this time whether they are*&#xD;
to marry each other or not," IL answered evasively.&#xD;
An hour after I sat by Effie's side; poor, weak, droop-&#xD;
ing Efile! She was not strong and independent enough to&#xD;
bear her fate alone, or II should have implored her to have&#xD;
done so.&#xD;
"Oh, strengthen me!" she sighed, laying her head on&#xD;
my breast, while slow tears ran over her face all unheeded.&#xD;
"How has it turned out, dearest?" I asked, stroking her&#xD;
golden hair. Her little hand lay over her heart, and hbld&#xD;
it back, as it were, with an ever4ncreasing pressure.&#xD;
"He wishes me to marry him," she answered.&#xD;
"Did you conceal any of your feelings from him?"&#xD;
"No. II told him how dead and worthless my heai~t&#xD;
was. He said he honored and trusted me because I was so&#xD;
candid with him."&#xD;
"Did you ask him if he thought it was wrong for you to&#xD;
enter into so sacred a covenant with such feelings, ERIe?"&#xD;
"Yes, .1 did~ He said he should once have thought so,&#xD;
but now he did not, for he had lived long enough to dis-&#xD;
cover that the majority of marriages arising from ha~ty love,&#xD;
terminated less happily than those which were founded upon&#xD;
a true knowledge of character. He said he did not expect&#xD;
a life free from shadows, but he thought I could make his&#xD;
quiet existence more bright and peaceful, and he would de-&#xD;
vote his whole being towards making me content with my&#xD;
de9sion of this day. lie will not urge our marriage until&#xD;
II have learned to know him better. I am so grateful for&#xD;
this."&#xD;

366           WE MUST NOT BE T60 HAPPY.&#xD;
&#xD;
All the while that Effie talked, there was pressed upon&#xD;
my       a feeling~ that it was not right to marry without&#xD;
love. IL scarcely dared to say it, lest she would be teinpest&#xD;
tossed with indecision, and then finally would settle into the&#xD;
same fate. Poor Effle too often allowed others to think for&#xD;
her. Perhaps she might never find a more honest and faith-&#xD;
ful guide than Seth Cardover. As if answering to my&#xD;
thought, she said,&#xD;
"He says that in this practical world, th6 theories of our&#xD;
youth cannot always be carried out-..-there are millions who&#xD;
never iimeet those whom they could love best; therefore it&#xD;
was not reprehensible to choose some one who might in a&#xD;
less degree embellish the lonely path of existence. lie&#xD;
thought we could try to grow better together. When he&#xD;
said that, Kate, IL felt as if a watchful Providence had ap-&#xD;
pointed him to lead me through my earth-life. We do not&#xD;
live a great while here "-she brushed away her tears with&#xD;
something like hope. "It wc~uld not do for me to be too&#xD;
happy; I never should be 'faithful unto the end,' if IL were&#xD;
so very happy."&#xD;
"I am going to be your sister, dear Effie!" I said, and&#xD;
as I spoke I strove to conceal the proud joy that illuminated&#xD;
my heart.&#xD;
"Oh, what a comfort it will be!" she answered, raising&#xD;
her head, and looking at me observantly. A passionately&#xD;
yearning, hungering expression swept over her countenance&#xD;
as she said, "You l~3ve, dear Kate."&#xD;
My soul silently responded, A' How I pity.-pity-pity&#xD;
you, poor child!"&#xD;
*                            *        *&#xD;
One year from that time Effie and I stood at the mar-&#xD;
riage altar together. Her face was calm, tranquil, even&#xD;
hopeful. Ere we had left our room she had said to me, ".1&#xD;
collld not have~ believed that my feelings could have changed&#xD;
&#xD;
A GtLO1UF~ED LIGHT.&#xD;
so greatly in one year. Seth is so good, so genex~on5. I am&#xD;
sure that he loves me a great deal not-and IL know that IL&#xD;
shall learn to love him for the heart, strong a~d true, that&#xD;
beats in his unconiely form. Already, Kate, he seems to&#xD;
acquire a kind of beauty from this heart."&#xD;
When Pliny knelt beside me after the marriage vows&#xD;
were said, it seemed as if we knelt in a new and glorified&#xD;
light.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
FIVE years had passed away, during which I had been a&#xD;
wife. And once,.for one brief month, I had been a mother.&#xD;
But now our little Lilian,. "airy, fairy Lilian," played in&#xD;
"Bright fields beyond the swelling flood."&#xD;
Wiser hearts than mine heeded the unfolding of her in-&#xD;
fant nature, and holier hands guided her feet in paths of&#xD;
beauty and love. A passing sorrow it had been, that she&#xD;
had preceded us to the heaven-world, for often had we joy-&#xD;
ously dwelt on the hope that she would bloom on earth n~&#xD;
angel, shedding around her the healing perfume of a noble&#xD;
life. But we had long since learned to feel that it was best&#xD;
and brightest to yield h~er to God. A shining chain seemed&#xD;
thrown from earth to skies, now that she was there to web&#xD;
come us, when we should cross the stream.&#xD;
It was a day of June. Exultant nature poured out her&#xD;
laVish treasures, sunshine, and bird-music, and tender foliage&#xD;
waving in the glittering air. Our cottage was half buried&#xD;
amid fragrant vines, that clambered the slender piazza pil-&#xD;
lars, and were festooned about the low roof; the roses thrust&#xD;
themselves into our chamber window, and the honeysuckles&#xD;
filled the parlor and hall with delicious perfumes. It was&#xD;
afternoon, and Pliny had not returned from his business in&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
AN INTERESTING SCENE.&#xD;
&#xD;
369&#xD;
&#xD;
the city; but house, garden and lawn were traversed by gay&#xD;
feet. I stood in the porch, ~~xnd looked out upon the scene.&#xD;
In the grape avbor gli~tere 4 a long table, laden with white&#xD;
dishes. About it flitted the white-robed forms of Josephine&#xD;
and Lily: they were placing vases of flowers upon the table,&#xD;
and bidding Betty, my domestic, wait with her heaping&#xD;
dishes of strawberries until they were c~uite ready for them.&#xD;
Walter Gray and Frank Morton stood by, begging for some-&#xD;
thing to do. Their merry jests and laughter came to my&#xD;
ear, and my heart thrilled in joyous unison. Cousin Mary&#xD;
and Mr. IRodman walked quietly about, arm in arm. I&#xD;
could hardly help laughing to see Cousin Mary dressed in&#xD;
white, as we all were, and ornamented with roses. Jose-&#xD;
phine had insisted upon it, even Miss Cardover's black hair&#xD;
bore a white rose. Grace and Effie sat at the foot of an old&#xD;
elm tree, looking beautiful and innocent. The girls had&#xD;
crowned them with blush roses, and had placed a bouquet of&#xD;
the same in the bosoms of their dresses, because, as they&#xD;
laughingly said, they had entered the kingdom of wedded love.&#xD;
They had also adorned me in the same manner, but upon&#xD;
their girlish brows only white buds lay. And yet within&#xD;
their eloquent eyes dwelt the dream of love, and two handsome&#xD;
forms followed their footsteps, and two noble, brilliant faces&#xD;
lighted up with joy anear them. At Effie's knee stood a&#xD;
fairy creature of two years, shy as a fawn, and as graceful&#xD;
and gleesome. The young mother was twining a wreath to&#xD;
cross the shoulders, and clasp beneath the tender arms of&#xD;
"little Sylph," as she loved to call her child. Grace's&#xD;
Harry, a golden-haired, angelic child, ran towards her from&#xD;
the house. He had, been sleeping, and his flushed cheeks&#xD;
were rosy as the flowers; his eyes were brilliant and tender&#xD;
as the summer sky. He was one of those rare children,&#xD;
towards whom the heart bounds with overflowing love.&#xD;
Many a time he came tQ spend a day with me, and when&#xD;

&#xD;
the sun began to decline, we would turn our feet towards&#xD;
the ivy-covered stone mansion, where his happy parents&#xD;
dwelt during the season of flowers.&#xD;
Suddenly I saw Mr. Waidron, Seth and Pliny at the&#xD;
gate. I bounded down the steps, and ran tQ meet them. As&#xD;
I passed tha. arbor I heard Frank say to Josephine, "Josey,&#xD;
when we have been married as long as Mrs. Pliny Cardover&#xD;
has, don't you think we shall manage to, look lcss enraptured&#xD;
at the sight of 6ach other?"&#xD;
I looked laughing back to hear Josephine's reply. It&#xD;
was womanly of course. "Why, Frank, it is her guests she&#xD;
is so glad to see."&#xD;
And right glad I was to see the guests too, good and&#xD;
noble ones, who would make earth a heaven, if they could.&#xD;
As we walked back, Grace and Effie met us, with their en-&#xD;
chanting. children. I read in their lovely faces the same joy&#xD;
that ever came to my heart, when Pliny's beloved face broke&#xD;
upon my vision. I knew that Effie did nbt comprehend the&#xD;
fathomless depth of a love like mine, or Grace's; but she&#xD;
loved Seth very much, and was very happy, and Grace and I&#xD;
never spoke to her of the glorious splendors and tender&#xD;
sweetnesses that blessed our heart-world. We marri d&#xD;
people took a little stroll down by the river side, promise g&#xD;
to return when a bell should call us to tea. lit sounded t&#xD;
last, and we went to the arbor, where the girls and their by rs&#xD;
met us. Lily was so matchlessly lovely, her large ey&#xD;
melting, flashing with the love at her heart.&#xD;
"Oh, Pliny! how beautiful she is!" I whispered, una le&#xD;
to take my fascinated gaze fro mher.&#xD;
"Yes, beautiful indeed. A noble pair they are; b t,&#xD;
Kitty, they have yet to learn, as we have done, how infinite&#xD;
and drainless the ocean of love is. Do you suppose Grace&#xD;
and Horace would exchange feelings with them?"&#xD;
"Oh, not for worlds! it would be like going back to the&#xD;
&#xD;
jflflOCCflCC of infancy, after having drained the deepest joys of&#xD;
maturity."&#xD;
"The days of our betrotliment were like theirs, we&#xD;
would not return to them," Pliny said and. looked down, a&#xD;
tender chaste smile hovering on his lip. I only looked in his&#xD;
eyes with a smile for reply.&#xD;
We seated ourselves at table, "a merrier cc~mpanie."&#xD;
Cousin Mary whispered, "How I wish Gertrude and James&#xD;
were here."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed," I returned; "but Gerty writes that she&#xD;
is such a happy wife. She has become acquainted with Mrs.&#xD;
Henry's family, and loves dear Jessie as if she were a sister."&#xD;
"Oh, Katy! "said Pliny, "that reminds me that I have a&#xD;
letter from the South for you, from Miss Baldwin I think."&#xD;
"Oh, give it to me! They have only written once since&#xD;
Mr. Henry's death."&#xD;
"Go on pouring out the tea; you can't have the letter&#xD;
now, little wife."&#xD;
II accordingly went on pouring out the tea, and listening&#xD;
to the gay chat around the table: it finally merged into&#xD;
earnest conversation upon the well-being of the race. lilt was&#xD;
sweet to sit and listen, the while my heart gave light, ex-&#xD;
ulting bounds, to feel that each soul present had, during the&#xD;
past five years grown richer and stronger, holding with de4en-&#xD;
ing faith a trust in the everlasting beauty.&#xD;
When our physical wants were supplied, we found that&#xD;
Walter and Frank had prepared some merry toasts to sur-&#xD;
prise us with. As soon as we rose from table, II stole to the&#xD;
deserted elm-tree to read my letter. It ran thus, and was&#xD;
from Miss Baldwin.&#xD;
"DEAR KATE-How gloriously the summer sunshine floods&#xD;
the earth as I write. I am sitting in the school room, whence&#xD;
I look out of the window occasionally to see Minnie and the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC8254-00000187"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
THE SLAVE SCHOOL.              873&#xD;
&#xD;
children in the garden. What do you suppose they are&#xD;
about'? Why, Minnie is teaching them botany. Don't open&#xD;
your eyes, for I presume you are wondering how she has&#xD;
been able to reeolle~t her studies. Well! I proposed to her&#xD;
to rub up her last knowledge on this subject, that she might&#xD;
teach the children. You know she is passionately fond of&#xD;
flowers., Ah! Kate, you don't know what nice times we have&#xD;
now that Philip Henry has departed this mortal life. Don't&#xD;
seold, for I am not a saint yet, and fear I never sh~dl be.&#xD;
I've tried conscientiously to feel a little sorry for him, but&#xD;
right on top of the effort, comes the thought that he ought to&#xD;
be chained, if he won't do any thing but make others unhappy.&#xD;
But understand me, Kate: before he died, II was able to feel&#xD;
an ardent desire that he might secure eternal peace, and I&#xD;
outgrew the habit of treating him with contempt. Yet,&#xD;
when I see that Minnie's nature seems to bloom into fresh&#xD;
youth, I cannot but be glad that the incubus is removed&#xD;
from her heart. She and Jessie are like sisters, rather than&#xD;
mother and daughter. Jessie is the guiding spirit of Minnie,&#xD;
4&#xD;
~ without knowing it, and my darling drinks in health from&#xD;
her young, strong soul. Jessie is governess, to the children&#xD;
now: the dear child proposed being so herself.&#xD;
"Egbert and Harriet, made us a short visit not long ago.&#xD;
They are about as happy as might have been expected. She.&#xD;
is a nonsensical little thing, as she always was. She wrangles&#xD;
with\ Egg one mir~ute, and coaxes huin into any thing she&#xD;
pleases the' next. The saints preserve us! when I look about&#xD;
upon' my married friends, I still rejoice that no man has the&#xD;
right to rule over me. I really begin to hope Fred won't be&#xD;
the rascal his father was; the ~hild seems to have quite a&#xD;
conscience. Ah! '(ate, your eyes would run over with tears,&#xD;
if you could hear, as I sometimes do, his mother praying with&#xD;
him, when he has done wrong. There is an entreating pathos&#xD;
in her voice that melts Freddie at once. I cannot but hope&#xD;
&#xD;
those prayers will prove a shield and talisman to the boy, when&#xD;
he shall have entered into manhood. My innocent Minnie is&#xD;
not one to let her child go to destruction through false modesty.&#xD;
She intends in early youth to warn him of the rocks upon which&#xD;
his father's soul and her own peace were shipwrecked. Kate!&#xD;
mothers have not done all they ought to make their sons true&#xD;
husbands; to stay the tide of' agony at the broken hearts of&#xD;
&#xD;
WlV~5~~nd now I have something to tell you that I think will&#xD;
dcl ~gh t you more than all. Jessie has one central thought;&#xD;
on~ idea which she lives to accomplish; and Minnie and I&#xD;
are~ equally earnest about it. We intend to educate our slaves&#xD;
for freedom. Minnie and Jessie already have papers made&#xD;
out, so that if death should surprise them, their consciences&#xD;
may be free. 'Butt after many consultations and much thought,&#xD;
we have resolved to offer to the slaves the chance of working&#xD;
out their liberty. The nest morning after we came to this&#xD;
decision, we called all the servants together, and it was voted&#xD;
that ill should address them. I did so! they wept and shouted&#xD;
with delight, but a month afterwards, there were but three&#xD;
men out of the sixty, who had discovered energy enough to&#xD;
work over hours. You know, Kate, they are not severely&#xD;
taxed. This was a sad disappointment to Jessie, but did&#xD;
not surprise me. What reason had we to expect qualities&#xD;
that spring from hopes cradled in childhood, fostered in&#xD;
youth, acted from in manhood'? I saw that we had heavy&#xD;
duties to perform, and my heart beat high as I realized the4&#xD;
magnitude of the work before us. We had a school estab~&#xD;
listed: to this Minnie, Jessie and I have devoted three&#xD;
evenings in the week. We teach them to read and write; a&#xD;
very dull task it is, but after the lessons are over, the dusky&#xD;
group gathers more closely around us, and we read some&#xD;
story suited to their comprehension, and calculated to cherish&#xD;
honest aspirations. The unspeakable delight of our auditors&#xD;

communicates itself to our own hearts, and some new charm&#xD;
seems to spring from the simple pages which could not&#xD;
attract attention, if read aside from the thrilled souls of&#xD;
such listeners This reading has a magic influence in stirring&#xD;
up the dormant faculties of the negroes: it introduces them&#xD;
into a fresh and higher world; from niorfing until night,&#xD;
labor is cheered by allusions to the story; thus innocent&#xD;
thoughts become the food of the spirit, and the interior life&#xD;
of the servants is gradually elevated. One slave 4fter another&#xD;
conceives the idea of acting a better part in life: the energy&#xD;
of one is communicated, and the hope of freedom acquires&#xD;
sufficient power to overcome constitutional indolence. Those&#xD;
who earn their freedom, and still prefer remaining With us,&#xD;
we shall hire. To me, it seems that slaves should manifest&#xD;
energy enough to earn liberty, else they are hardly fitted&#xD;
to become men in a busy world. The principle of bondage&#xD;
we know to be wrong, but this principle is most efficiently&#xD;
assailed by instilling into the negro race strength to rise&#xD;
above its dominion. Mr. and Mrs. I3edell visit us very&#xD;
often; they are as happy as two little birds. Jessie has a&#xD;
sort of worshipping love for Gertrude, and she aLways goes to&#xD;
her when her path of duty is uncertain. IL have never known&#xD;
an instance where Mrs. Bedell's advice has not been of the&#xD;
wisest character; her beautiful daily life exemplifies the&#xD;
principles that lovingly control her: these principles have&#xD;
been inseminated into her being from childhood; thus there&#xD;
is an abiding strength in her goodness which Jessie re~ilizes&#xD;
and needs. It costs our heroic Jessie infinitely more effort&#xD;
to live up to the standard she desires to, than it does Mrs.&#xD;
Bedell; this is not because one is naturally nobler than the&#xD;
other, but human hands and hearts have ever strengthened&#xD;
Gertrude in self-renunciation, and our poor Jessie was not&#xD;
so aided in "add lang syne." Remember me to your hus-&#xD;

"ADELAIDE BALDWIN."&#xD;
II read the letter to the group who had been chatting&#xD;
near mc: when I read about Gertrude, II glanced at Cousin&#xD;
Mary; the quick, delighted color sprang to her cheek, and&#xD;
tears to her eyes. Cousin John' passed his arm around her&#xD;
with a tender, grateful reverence, which was well fitted to&#xD;
reward her for her patient devotion to his better nature.&#xD;
When the letter had been fully descanted upon, a cotillion&#xD;
on the lawn Was proposed. Grace and Eflie took their chil-&#xD;
dren iu the house. The set was full without Pliny and my-&#xD;
self. We dropped on the low seat under the elm tree, and&#xD;
looked on. 'The western sunlight fell with ethereal softness&#xD;
upon the group, and tinged the grape arbor with vermilion,&#xD;
while it slanted brilliantly across the lawn, and illuminated&#xD;
as with fire the cottage windows. At one of the windows&#xD;
appeared the angelic face of Harry, who was looking oi~t ra-&#xD;
diant with smiles, his curly head framed in a halo of light.&#xD;
12 looked at him as if he had been a vision.&#xD;
"What is Kitty thinking of?" asked Pliny.&#xD;
"IL was thinking it was two years ago to-day since Lil-&#xD;
ian entered Heaven; it seems so beautiful to think that she&#xD;
now must be more transcendental fair than that lovely child&#xD;
*&#xD;
at the window. And IL was also thinking, Pliny, of the many&#xD;
poor children who are born under adverse cir~imstance5.&#xD;
Is it not our duty to take one or two such into our home?"&#xD;
"I have often thought we ought, Katy, but I waited for&#xD;
you to make the proposition."&#xD;
"Then it shall be done forthwith!" I answered joyfully,&#xD;
exulting to have found a definite field of labor. Josephine&#xD;
came and sat beside us, her lovely cheeks glowing with exer-&#xD;
cise.&#xD;
"When are you going to step within the kingdom of love,&#xD;

THE CURTAIN FALLS.&#xD;

Josey?" asked Pliny smiling. "Whert are you going to&#xD;
give Frank a legal right to1 torment you?"&#xD;
She blushed deeply, but with all her childish artlessness&#xD;
replied, "In the fall, t believe." then to turn the subject, she&#xD;
said, "You did not see Judith when she was here, Kate?"&#xD;
"No! how did she look?"&#xD;
"Very beautiful: I thought she seemed happy too," re!&#xD;
turned Josephine. "Mrs. Morton often shows me her let-&#xD;
ters; they betray a sort of content"&#xD;
"Did you see Mr. Benzoni?"&#xD;
"Yes, and I observed that he was very kind and atten-&#xD;
tive to his wife. 11 should judge they had learned by expe-&#xD;
lience that it was best to study each other's ciomfort..-.~-.They&#xD;
had a beautiful infant with them. Judith's life seemed&#xD;
bound up in it. I thought the child was dearer to her than&#xD;
the husband."&#xD;
"Doubtless!"&#xD;
The curtain falls. Dear reader, Good-bye!&#xD;
