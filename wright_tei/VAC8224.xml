PREFACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Entered,. according toyAct of Congress; in the year 1874,&#xD;

&#xD;
FEW persons, probably,. of the present generation are&#xD;
aware that in the time of the American Revolution there&#xD;
was carried on a border warfare between Long Island and&#xD;
the Connecticut coast, which for romantic incident was&#xD;
his tales of the Scottish Border. The parties in this war-&#xD;
fare were mostly the whigs and tories of that day, between&#xD;
whom there was a bitterness of hostility far greater than&#xD;
existed between the colonies and the British themselves.&#xD;
The details of the strife, tragic and comic, the plots and&#xD;
counterplots, the deeds of wild adventure, of heroism and&#xD;
endurance, which then occurred, would, if. fully narrated,&#xD;
filvolumes.&#xD;
SThe tale we here present to our readers relates' to one&#xD;
ofthe noteworthy incidents of those times, In all essefttial&#xD;
rgespects it is strictly true. Every impottant event men-&#xD;

tioned is well ai~ithenticated. Many details' as to ti~es,&#xD;
places, persons, etc.', have been ascertained from the public&#xD;
records of the county and the state, and may be relied on&#xD;
as accurate, though differing~ somewhat fr&amp;amp;m other state-&#xD;
ments whicl have been ~printed, or have been handed down&#xD;
by tradition The outline of the story has many times&#xD;
been told to the writer by a near relative, a sister of the&#xD;
"stolen boy," ivho had herself a personal knowledge of the&#xD;
facts, and who died a few years ago at the extreme age&#xD;
of ninety-nine. He, has also received much inf6rrnation&#xD;
from, other aged persons who were well acquainted with&#xD;
the actors the events, among whom he. desires particu-&#xD;
larl to name his venerable' friend, the REV. SMITH&#xD;
DAYTON, of New Haven, still sui~viving, , with vigorous&#xD;
step and unimpaired faculties, at the age of ninety, who&#xD;
has loaned him nianuscripts left him1 by his father, Captain&#xD;
Ebenezer Dayton, in relation to the transaction.&#xD;
Though the history of {he Revolutionary period has&#xD;
/&#xD;
been so often and so ably written, it is yet comparatively&#xD;
little known to *many of the present day. A general&#xD;
acquaintance with its public events, the 'Declaration of&#xD;
Independence, and the principal. incidents of the war which&#xD;
established it, may be possessed, but beyond this there is&#xD;
great vagueness of prehensionn. The people of the cob-&#xD;
&#xD;
PREFACE.                5&#xD;
&#xD;
nies were thinly scattered over a vast territory, so that&#xD;
much that occurred among them was never known out of&#xD;
the immediate locality, and much that was known was never&#xD;
recorded. The uUquitous sews-gatherer of modern times&#xD;
had not then been born. The causes which led to'. e&#xD;
separation from the mother country, the struggles, priva-&#xD;
tions, aind sufferings incident to the war, all indeed that&#xD;
rna~ be called the domestic history of that period, is not&#xD;
only little known to mo~t of this generation but cannot&#xD;
easily be conceived of by them.&#xD;
In carefully gathering up, then, wh'at has been trans-&#xD;
mitted to us by tradition or otherwise, before it shall be&#xD;
irrecoverable lost, and while it may still be verified and&#xD;
illustrated by family manuscripts, and hi some instances by&#xD;
the personal testh~ony of the very few ~surviving who lived&#xD;
near those times, we may not only furnish matter to interest&#xD;
our contemp6raries, but add something to the stock of&#xD;
materials which shall serve the uses. of the historians, the&#xD;
artists, and the statesmen of the future.&#xD;
Nor can we forbear to add that 'the examples of that age&#xD;
are full of instruction. The poverty and the 'hardships then&#xD;
endured were a ~evere' school, in which, nevertheless, were&#xD;
trained many noble characters. It was a school of heroism&#xD;
which may well be studied by us, who live in these more&#xD;

have delineated it fully in a single sketch like the present,&#xD;
but we may still hope that, as a glance at the time, and its&#xD;
lessons both of patriotism and religion, the story we relate&#xD;

"Why, don't you see? I've been up to town,&#xD;
I'&#xD;
to training."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; I forgot. \Have to train pretty often&#xD;
now; don't you? I wish I was only older ;~ I should&#xD;
like to~ go too. I belie e I'd go as it is, if father&#xD;
and the boys were at ome; but our folks can't.&#xD;
spare me now."&#xD;
"You! What a pity you can't! A pretty sob&#xD;
dier you'd make such a whipper-snapper as that;&#xD;
You couldn't ~~ry a musket all day if you tried';&#xD;
and as to going into the army, you'd die in a week&#xD;
of~drying for ~your mammy."&#xD;
"Well, 'tan't no use talking about it, any ~vay;&#xD;
for I can't go; 'that's certain. But I wish father&#xD;
was ~at home, for all that."&#xD;
"When do you expect him?" a~ked tl~e young&#xD;
soldier.&#xD;
"We are looking~for him now every day. Mother&#xD;
had word~ fr6m him, tlkree weeks ago, that Roswell&#xD;
could walk about some, arid he hoped~ they'd be&#xD;
able to start fQr home in a few days."&#xD;
~ \V~5 been the matter with Rosweli ?"&#xD;
"Ohd on't you knew that he's been sick? He&#xD;
took colJ one day when they had been out skir~&#xD;
missing, and this brought on lung fever and rheu-~&#xD;
&#xD;
matism. He was dick a long while, and the doctor&#xD;
said he would not be well enough to join his corn-&#xD;
pany again very soon, if ever; so they gave him&#xD;
his discharge. Father went to take care of him.&#xD;
He is better now, as I told y6u, and we are ex-&#xD;
pecting him home cvery slay. But tell me, David,&#xD;
when is your company going ?"&#xD;
"Don't know; orders haven't, come yet. And&#xD;
it's my private opinion they won't come very soon.&#xD;
The whole thing's pretty much played out, I guess."&#xD;
"Played out! What do you mean by that?"&#xD;
exclaimed the lad, with much spirit.&#xD;
"Oh, don't go to firing up before you're hurt. I&#xD;
mean just .what I say. Your independencee,' as&#xD;
you call it, is all humbug. That 'ere fight on Long&#xD;
Island, which happened a few days ago, has finished&#xD;
that, and, no mistake."&#xD;
"What fight do you mean?"&#xD;
* "Why, haven't you heard Qf it yet? It was a&#xD;
big one, you may believe. The British pitched into&#xD;
Old Put, and just chawed up about half of his men,&#xD;
and, if General Clinton hadn't been over careful,&#xD;
might just as well have had the rest. They were&#xD;
all cooped up in a corner, with the Hessians behind&#xD;
them, and ~he general thought h&amp;amp;d keep them.&#xD;

there till he could bring his vessels up the bay,&#xD;
and take them in front; but Washington, for once,&#xD;
was too smart for him. That night there came up&#xD;
a fog so thick that you could cut it with a knife,&#xD;
and he taok' advantage of it to send over a parcel&#xD;
of boats,ancd hurry his men all across the river,&#xD;
before mo ning, into New York. Sergeant Hiickox&#xD;
was up to the muster to-day, and told us all about&#xD;
it. He was not ir~ the fight, but with, the troops&#xD;
on this side, and has come home- to see about get-&#xD;

for ,the hospitals. He boasts of the affair as a&#xD;
smart thing, aI so it wa for the fellows that got&#xD;
away ; but the fact is, the rebels got a good -sound&#xD;
thrashing, and -served them right too."'&#xD;
The last words were spoken in a lower tone, and&#xD;
with a slight pause, as if expressing an opinion&#xD;
which he cared not to have, reported.. iheg met&#xD;
an indignant response from the young teamsman.&#xD;
" Dave Wooster, you are a tory and a villain !&#xD;
A pretty soldier you'll make to defend the cause of'&#xD;
liberty. You ought to be reported to the authori-&#xD;

what's the use of getting mad, Chauncey ? I an't&#xD;
the only one that thinks so. I've 'heard' lots of&#xD;
them talk think very dg.y. Parson Scovill himself&#xD;
was one. Father and he were listening to the&#xD;
news ; and says the parson, 'What a child's play all&#xD;
this~ training is ! 'Tan't ofeany use. All the Conti-&#xD;
nental army is no more account against the British&#xD;
redcoats than a parcel of squaws. The Assembly&#xD;
at Hartford has no right to take our time this way,&#xD;
and -subject the colony to so much expense. Talk&#xD;
about liberty ! What do, they care T~r it ? Just&#xD;
see what they did to Captain Bron ont and Ensign&#xD;
Scovill, cashiering them for speaking -their honest&#xD;
~entiments on this subject. They are as arbitrary&#xD;
athe pope of Rome, and he people won't stand it&#xD;
much longer."&#xD;
"Did he say that, David ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he did, for I heard him. He said the&#xD;
whole trouble was brought on by the rich men of&#xD;
Boston destroying the tea. 1 Ie thought it a mean&#xD;
and contemptible thing, that they shouldn't be will&#xD;

being of an age.to be enrolled in 'one of the militia&#xD;
companies of the place, although boys of sufficient&#xD;
size and, strength were sometimes admi~ted~ into&#xD;
them under the prescribed age. He was a stout&#xD;
young man, {h dark eyes ana black, curling hair,&#xD;
'fearless in his disposition, and with ,a sort of gen-'&#xD;
erous roughness of manners and speech that made&#xD;
him a favorite among his companions. We have&#xD;
not repeated all the terms with which he was wont&#xD;
to garnish his conversation - terms which, he used~&#xD;
as many a thoughtless lad beside him has done,&#xD;
under the mistaken idea that they imparted force&#xD;
and smartness to his sayings. The two boys had&#xD;

As the war wen-t on, a#id the feelings of both par-&#xD;
ties became morQ and more bitter, severe laws were&#xD;
enacted agaiAst ~the stories. Persons suspected of&#xD;
being such might be arrested under a magistrate's&#xD;
warratit, and tried for their sentiments, and if con-&#xD;
victed might be banished and sent away to the&#xD;
enemy, under the penalty of death if they should&#xD;
ret~irn~' They who absented themselves from their&#xD;
homes in the country, or withdrew to British pro-&#xD;
tection, were liable to the con~scation* of their&#xD;
estates. In Connecticut, the off4se of supplying&#xD;
provisions to the enemy, or giving them informa-&#xD;
tion, or aiding in~the enlistment of troops, or har-&#xD;
boring and countenancing thQse who were engaged&#xD;
in such "treasonable practices," was punished by&#xD;
fines, confiscation, and imprisonment. Even to&#xD;
speak or write, or act in amy way against the doings&#xD;
of Congress, or the General Assembly, was to incur&#xD;
disarming, disqualification for office, fines, and im-&#xD;
prisonment, accord ig to the aggravation of the&#xD;
offense. Even death itself was added to the other&#xD;
penalties prescribed, and in some cases was actually&#xD;
inflicted. A' man named Dunbar, belonging to&#xD;
Northbury, now Plymouth, Conn., who joined the&#xD;
British, and received a captain's commission from&#xD;
&#xD;
the king, was convicted of treason, and hanged&#xD;
in Hartford, in i777, and the gallows, in a public&#xD;
place, was kept standing for a long time, as a warn-&#xD;
ing to others.&#xD;
In many instances, doubtless,' the stories suffered&#xD;
great injustice.; Mistaken as they were, and crim-&#xD;
inal as they often became in their acts of hostility&#xD;
to the country, there can be no question that not a&#xD;
few were upright~, and even patriotic~ men. It may&#xD;
be interesting to glance, for a moment, at some of&#xD;
the causes which led them to sympathize with the&#xD;
British side.&#xD;
Some of them thought that rebellion against the&#xD;
lawful government was a szn. They could not be-&#xD;
lieve. there was any deliberate design on the part of&#xD;
the  ritish ministry to infringe upon the chartered&#xD;
rights of the colonists, or' to destroy their liberties&#xD;
as Eiglishmen. But if there were, they held that&#xD;
it was wrong ~o resist their encroachments by force.&#xD;
To them the king was the anointed minister of&#xD;
Heaven, ruling"' by the grace of God," and his sub-&#xD;
jects were under command by the highest of all&#xD;
'authority to "honor the king as well as to! "fear&#xD;
God." Armed resistance to h'is government was&#xD;
treason and rebellion, crimes justly punishable by&#xD;

all laws, human and divine. Men of this class there'&#xD;
have ~dways been. In the' time of th~ Stuarts 'they&#xD;
were believers in the "divine right Qf the king to do'&#xD;
wrong," and denounced Cromwell and the Puritans&#xD;
of 1640 as traitors 'and regicides. In our own day&#xD;
'they upheld the Mexican war and the fugitive ~ lave,&#xD;
law, because they were "constitutional," ~nd pi;o-&#xD;
4&#xD;
bounced the doctrine of the "higher law" fanati-&#xD;
cism. We will not condemr~ these men. Many of&#xD;
them were honest and conscientious, and in private&#xD;
life above reproach. Nay, tbeyhave a valuable part&#xD;
to play~ in society. Conseiyatism is the 'ballast&#xD;
which 'often keeps the ship ~f state stead~~ on her&#xD;
course, and enables her to bear the prop~Usion of&#xD;
bolder principles an'd more energetic purposes in&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
~         Another class, no less honest in their views, were&#xD;
those who~ were impressed with the hopelessness&#xD;
of resistance. To such it seemed little short of'&#xD;
madness in these feeble colonies t think of con-&#xD;
tending against the entire force' f that empire,&#xD;
uppn which, it has been so proudly said, " the ~un&#xD;
~never sets." How often had she humbled the&#xD;
proudest nations of Europe! Many then living&#xD;
had. seen the triumphs of her victorious arms in&#xD;
&#xD;
Canada,. when tIle i' Grand Monarque" of France&#xD;
had been compelled to cede. ihis provinces to her.&#xD;
Her armies were composed of veterans, command-&#xD;
ed by accomplished officers, and in the highest&#xD;
state of discipline. They looked with contempt&#xD;
on the raw Yankee militia, and were looked upon&#xD;
by the latter as in every respect their superiors.&#xD;
The successes tliese had achieved at Le~ir~gton,&#xD;
and Bunker Hill, and Ticonderoga, as 9onished&#xD;
themselves as m~uch as their enemies. On the&#xD;

dozen little vessels and a few privateers were all&#xD;
that the colonies could float to match that irnpe-&#xD;
rial, navy whose undisputed boast it was, that&#xD;
"Britannia rules the waves." The sentiments of&#xD;
the burlesque hero MeFingal' ~were scarcely a&#xD;

among all classes..&#xD;

which Providence was pleased to crown our cause&#xD;
was due quite as much to the blunders of the Brit-&#xD;
ish Cabinet and Parliament, as to the military skill&#xD;
and prowess of the colonies.&#xD;
It must be remembered, too, that at the out-&#xD;
set nobody dreamed of separation from Great&#xD;
Britain. The leading patriots of the time, Adams,&#xD;
Otis, Franklin, Henry, Washington, and others,&#xD;
are often spoken of as having deliberately planned&#xD;
the steps leading to that separation, as if by some&#xD;
prophetic instinct they foresaw the futur~ great-&#xD;
ness of this country as an empire of powerful&#xD;
states. But nothing Can be further from the fruth.&#xD;
They resisted to get rid of wrongs then pressing&#xD;
upon them, and only advanced to rebellion as they&#xD;
were pushed to it. England was, in their regard,&#xD;
still the dear home-land, loved as such and bound&#xD;
to them by all the associations of a common faith&#xD;
&#xD;
and a glorious history. The highest boast .of our&#xD;
fathers x~vas, that they were Englishmen, and their&#xD;
constant plea, that they were only maintaining&#xD;
their inalienable English liberties. What they&#xD;
wanted, then, was not independence, hi~t the equal&#xD;
enjoyment of those liberties with their British&#xD;
brethren. D~. Franklin, just before the fight at&#xD;
Lexington, told the Parliament committee that he&#xD;
had "more than once traveled almost from one end&#xD;
of the continent to the other, and kept a variety of&#xD;
company, eating, drixiking, and conversing with&#xD;
them freely, and never had heard in any~ conversa-&#xD;
tion, from any person, drunk or, sober, the least&#xD;
expression of a wish for separation, or a hint that&#xD;
such a thing would be advantageous to America.~~&#xD;
And even John Adams declared afterward, "~ There&#xD;
was not a moment during the Revolution when I&#xD;
woPld not have given every thiPg I possessed for a&#xD;
restoration to th~ state of things before the contest&#xD;
began, provided we could have had a sufficient se-&#xD;
curity for its.continuance."&#xD;
While such, then, had been the common senti-&#xD;

wondered at that ~o many still adhered to them,&#xD;
even after the war broke out. The loyalists claimed&#xD;

ancA which, if not opposed sucdessfuily, would end&#xD;
in .the loss -of their' most cherished isi t n,&#xD;
political and religious. The Church-of-E and&#xD;
men held different views, and had .different sympa-'&#xD;

church, and Congregationalisrn -as a heresy which&#xD;
had ruled too long in this country., fhey favored&#xD;
the views and hoped for the triumph of the British9&#xD;

These views were very prevalent in the ton of&#xD;
Waterbury. " The. two parties were mere evenly&#xD;

-religious truth, and such the wickedness of. unbe-&#xD;
lief, or a contrary belief, that men are apt to think&#xD;
any rneans justifiable which tend1 to spread the one&#xD;
or suppress the other. The Congregationalists&#xD;
cannot plead guiltless to the charge of attempting,&#xD;
when in authority, to crush out dissent by'the&#xD;

New England tqok the lead in opposition to the&#xD;
war. They kept up a correspondence with the&#xD;
Society [for Propagating the Gos~el1 at home,, of&#xD;
which they were beneficiaries, in which they ex-&#xD;
pressed their vicwg freely of the merits of the con-.&#xD;
troversy, and gave information of th~ state of the&#xD;
country. The loyalty of their own church was a&#xD;
subject for frequent comment ahd congratulation.&#xD;
Dr. Richard Mansfield, of Derby, wrote in Deceit-~&#xD;
ber, 1775, that he had preached and taught quiet&#xD;
subjection to the king and parent state, and that he&#xD;
~was well assured that ~he clergy in general of the&#xD;
colony of Connecticut ~had done the same. Of the&#xD;
one hundred and thirty families under his charge,&#xD;
one hundred aPd~ ten, he continued, are firfri and&#xD;
&#xD;
steadfast friends to government, and detest and&#xD;
abhor the present unnatural rebellion, and all those&#xD;
measures which led to it. Further on, he remarked&#xD;
that 'the worthy Mr. Scovill [of Waterbury], and&#xD;
the venerable Mr. Beach [of Newtown] have had&#xD;
*     still better success, scarcely a single person being&#xD;
K     found of their congregations but what hath perse-&#xD;
vered steadfastly in his duty and loyalty.'"'&#xD;
Among these royalists were sever~i of the prin-&#xD;
c ipal families of ~ermantown. Mr. Jolamah Gunn&#xD;
was the largest landholder and richest man in1 the&#xD;
town. He carried on extensive operations on his&#xD;
farm, and employed many men to labor for him.&#xD;
*     In his sentiments, as well as the magnitude of his&#xD;
business, he resembled an English squire. He did&#xD;
~ot believe in the doctrines of equality which be-&#xD;
gan to be so rife in society. He would have the&#xD;
good old custom of lords and tenants maintained,&#xD;
and thought that all who were not rich enough to&#xD;
own land s1~ould be bound to service to those that&#xD;
were.&#xD;

was irnibued with sentiments of ,opposition to the&#xD;

of the town. His brothers, Dartiel, John, -Thomas,&#xD;

* The discipline of the .army they found almost intol..&#xD;

As might readily be sup~os~d, these stories in&#xD;
the British service were among th~ most dreaded&#xD;
foes of the inhabitants living i~ the vicinity of the&#xD;

plundering excursions, in. which they carried off&#xD;
cattle, hay, fruits,,and stores of all sorts for the use&#xD;
of the troops. In the neighborhood of New York,&#xD;
they were named "cow-boys," 'from the frequency&#xD;
and success, of these raids. Their familiarity With&#xD;
'the country and its people enabled them 'to plan&#xD;
&#xD;
C&#xD;
their excursions successfully, and escape, for the&#xD;
most part, with impunity. Often they had old&#xD;
grudges against those who had insulted or prose-&#xD;
cuted them, and they could now couple with the&#xD;
plunder they 'carried ,off the sweets of .~evenge. It&#xD;
is needless to~, say how rapidly the morals of men&#xD;
thus engaged would deteiviorate, and how soon&#xD;
many of those who at first were simply honest&#xD;
royalists became robbers, and murderers, hardened&#xD;
in every crime.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.'&#xD;
THE JUDD FAMILY.&#xD;
&#xD;
family to which our young friend&#xD;
1~'Chauncey Judd belonged 'was descended&#xD;
one of the oldest and most respec-&#xD;
table 4in the town. His grandfather Joseph was&#xD;
the son of Thomas, the third in a succession of&#xD;
Thomas Judds, who were among the colonial mag-&#xD;
nates, enjoying the highest offices and honors of&#xD;
the community. The first was one of' the little&#xD;
band that made their long journey,'in 1635, through&#xD;
the woods from Massachusetts to the banks of the&#xD;
Connecticut, carrying the wife of their pastor,&#xD;
Rev. Mr. llc~bker, in~ a litter upon their shoulders.&#xD;
Afterward, removing to Farmington, he~ was the&#xD;
first deacon of the church there, and very often a&#xD;
deputy t&amp;amp; the Genei~al Court. The second removed&#xD;
to Waterbury, where he was r~peated1y chosen&#xD;
38&#xD;
&#xD;
deputy, also a justice of th~ peace, and lieutenant,&#xD;
the highest military office permitted in a town&#xD;
until the number of soldiers it was able to enroll in&#xD;
its company was sixty-four.~ The third was a coyt-&#xD;
stable, town clerk and treasurer, schoolmaster, and&#xD;
"literary oracle of the settlement." We may add&#xD;
.that the successi~pn of Thomas Judds has continued&#xD;
unbroken to this day, and has, we believe, per~&#xD;
petuated. in itself and its collateral branches, t;o a&#xD;
good degree, the same qualities which so honorably&#xD;
characterized their Puritan ancestcir~.&#xD;
At its first settlement, Waterbur}~ was not con-&#xD;
sidered a very e~ igible spot for a pl~.ntation. The&#xD;
committee appo~ nted by the colonial legislature to&#xD;
visit the place, and ascertain its capabilities, re-&#xD;
ported that~ in their estimation, 'it contained about&#xD;
six hundred acres of land fit for cultivation, and&#xD;
that it might support thirty families. This will&#xD;
excite a smile, in view of the fact that now Water-.&#xD;
bury alone, without including the towns and parts&#xD;
of towns which have been set off from it, has a&#xD;
population of over thirteen thousand souls.&#xD;
As the lands at the center were 'taken up, it&#xD;
became necessary for the young men, 4and others&#xD;
who subsequently removed thither, to find abodes&#xD;

in the remoter districts. Four or five miles down&#xD;
the valley were broad natural meadows, on either&#xD;
side of the river, which were annually enriched by&#xD;
the overflow of its waters. These had belonged to&#xD;
Lieutenant Thomas Judd, from which circumstance&#xD;
the spot, with the surrounding district, came to be&#xD;
called "Judd's Meadow." Afterward, when the&#xD;
district became a distinct parish, it ~vas designated&#xD;
"Salem ;" and still later. at the time of its incor-&#xD;
~oration as a separate town, it borrowed from the&#xD;
romantic stream which traverses it the name of&#xD;
"Naugatuck," a word said to be derived from the&#xD;
Thdian terms naiag, or izaug, signifying a high&#xD;
point of land or promontory, and tuk', a river,&#xD;
meaning thus the "river of the high hills," a name&#xD;
that will be recognized as entirely appropriate by&#xD;
those who, are familiar with the picturesque moun-&#xD;
tain valley through which it flows.&#xD;
Hither Isaac Judd, the son of joseph, removed&#xD;
with his family a few years before the date of ou~&#xD;
~s~ory. Hjs farm was situated on' the old road&#xD;
leading' from "the Bridge" toward Gunntown,&#xD;
about a mile distant from the present village of&#xD;
Naugatuck. It was a pleasai~it location, on th~&#xD;
southern slope of a hill, overlooking the valley of&#xD;
&#xD;
the "Longmeadow Brook," a tributary of the Nau-&#xD;
gatUck. But the soil was not rich, the surface of&#xD;
the ground was stony, and whatever' in the way of&#xD;
crops was obtained from the farm was extorted by&#xD;
hard and untiring labor.&#xD;
They were brave hearts, who, in those old times,&#xD;
went forth from, the paternal roofio make to them-n&#xD;
selves new, homes, and to subdue the wilderness.&#xD;
Young men and maidens both were brought up to&#xD;
work, and they looked forward to it without dis-&#xD;
may, as to the one necessary and honorable busi-&#xD;
ness of life. And by work was meant farm labor,&#xD;
and its in-door accompaniments of the dairy, the&#xD;
distaff, and the loom. There were few trades, the.&#xD;
carpenter, the blacksmith, and the 'shoemaker sup-&#xD;
plying the chief wants of the people that were not&#xD;
supplied by home industry. Manufacturing, save&#xD;
of the simplest kind, had scarcely begun in the&#xD;
colonies, the mother country having by stringent&#xD;
regulations suppressed, as far as possible, all at-&#xD;
tempts in that direction which wouldJtend to spoil&#xD;
a market foi her wares. The sons of ~the rich only&#xD;
could aspire to the learned professions. Thus the&#xD;
choice of an occupation by a young man was, for ~ -'&#xD;
the most part, a very simple matter, and the only&#xD;

preparation needed for it that which he received&#xD;
as a matter of course from his own labors on his&#xD;
father's farm.&#xD;
Isaac Judd was twenty-five when he took the&#xD;
young Anna Williams, then in her sevehteenth&#xD;
year, to be a sharer in his 1&amp;amp;t of toil. Their patri-&#xD;
mohy on either hand was small. The bride's "set-&#xD;
ting out" usually consisted of a bed, with its linen&#xD;
and covering, the work of her own fingers, and&#xD;
sometimes 'a cow and a calf, or a dozen sheep;&#xD;
while a young man received his "freedom suit 7&#xD;
of home-raised and home-made cloth,' and a few&#xD;
pounds in ~~oney, or a horse or pair of oxen. But&#xD;
the ~roung couple did not murmur. They were&#xD;
rich in each other's love, and in that inexhaustible&#xD;
treasure of hope, which is the priceless heritage of&#xD;
all who h youth,&#xD;
ave      good health, and a pure heart;&#xD;
and th~'y went forth, hahd in hand, to carve o~t&#xD;
their own fortune, trusting to Him who had been&#xD;
the God of their fathers to guide and to bless them.~&#xD;
he farm having been purchased, the next, thing&#xD;
~4asjo build a house. This was~a more formidable&#xD;
undertaking in those days than ~t is at present.&#xD;
Timber Was' indeed abundant, but it was, growing&#xD;
in the forest, ana rViost of the processes necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
for converting it into boards, shingle~, and laths&#xD;
'had to be performed by hand. Nails~, glass, latches,&#xD;
and other hardware came from England, and were&#xD;
scarce and expensive. Bricks might be made, of&#xD;
course, for clay was everywhere abundant; but it&#xD;
cost labor to ma,1;e them, and there- was eVer' a&#xD;
convenient substitute in the fragments of granite&#xD;
which were thickly scattered over the ground.&#xD;
In due time the house was completed and occu-&#xD;
pied. It is still standing, thou gh~ now devoted to&#xD;
menial purposes.' The covering of tone end has&#xD;
been removed, and the owner stores there his ox-&#xD;
cart and other farm utensils. The low' attic is an&#xD;
open harbor for the swallows, which hang their mud&#xD;
nests upon its blackened rafters, and fly twittering&#xD;
around in endless convoluti6ns. The~rnassive frame,&#xD;
sufficient to make half a dozen such as w~ con-&#xD;
struct in modern times, still hugs the great smoke-'&#xD;
stained stone chimi~ey, whose, yawr~ing fireplaces&#xD;
were the cosy retreat of the youngsters in cold.&#xD;
winter nights. Tl~ ere~ are the rent oaken clap-&#xD;
boards, unpainted, and weather-beaten by the&#xD;
storms of a century ahd a quarter; the small wir~-&#xD;
dows; the doors, with their wooden hinges and&#xD;

nursed, where soft motherly hands smoothed th6&#xD;
sick pillow, and whence, alas! some precious ones&#xD;
were tenderly bQrne away to their cold resting-&#xD;
place' on the sandy hillock by the river-side.&#xD;
There'~ is the old " be~ t room," where company&#xD;
was received, and where,~ from time to time, blush-&#xD;
ing maidens heard ~he sweet words which wafted&#xD;
them into the fairy land of lbve and promise. Ah,&#xD;
it is sad to see these household shrines, conse-&#xD;
crated by the joys, the tears, the loves, the aspira-&#xD;
tions pf successive generations, falling into decay,&#xD;
and s5on, like those' who once dwelt there, to be&#xD;
known no more forever&#xD;
But we have been carried beyond our story. The&#xD;
house 'was completed, at least so far as to be&#xD;
habitable, and Judd and his young family mox~ed&#xD;
to their new home. They had lived a few~ years in&#xD;
the same neighborhood with his 4'ather, at Buck's&#xD;
Hill, and already nui~nbered some half a dozen as&#xD;
they met around their household board. Others&#xD;
came to them 'here, making, in all, the patriarchal&#xD;
number of twelve seVen boys and five girls; and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE JUDD FAMILY.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
when standing in a row across the end of the'&#xD;
kitchen, as the good father loved to arrange them,&#xD;
their leads rose in smiling gradation, from the&#xD;
little toddler Harvey to the manly Roswell, like&#xD;
notes on 'the, gamut of home love and happiness.&#xD;
R swell was the eldest, his father's pride, "the&#xD;
beginning of his strength." He was now, in 'I 776,&#xD;
absent in the army. Next was Rosanna, a fair,&#xD;
quiet girl, whose excellences had reached the hear-&#xD;
ing of Mr. Edward Perkins, a young widox~er 'in&#xD;
Betii'any, and caused him to ride up to Judd's&#xD;
Meadow oftener than any apparent business ren-&#xD;
dered necessary. He was a tall, dignifiect person,&#xD;
in velvet small clothes and snowy stockings, with.&#xD;
his jet-b ack hair hanging in a shining queue&#xD;
from un er his cocked hat the very picture of a&#xD;
gentleman of the olden time. It was a great won-&#xD;
derment with some of the younger ones what that&#xD;
tall man used to come there f5r so qften;' and they&#xD;
were not much pleased with the solution which&#xD;
~ sister Rosy" one day gave them, that he "came&#xD;
to tell them of his four poor motherless children,&#xD;
that had nobody to take care of them, and how he&#xD;
had asked her father if she might go down there&#xD;
and do jt, and he bad said she rn~ght; and so,&#xD;

before- the 'cold weather came, she was going."&#xD;
But she comforted them by adding that it was not&#xD;
far away, and, rnay be, father would some day let&#xD;
them come-down, and see her and the children -&#xD;
'a suggestion 'which was subsequently verified in a&#xD;
way which even sister Rosy herself did' not antici-&#xD;
pate. For one of them, grown to fair maidenhood&#xD;
not only saw the "children," but one of these also&#xD;
saw her, and. persuaded her to remain in Bethany,&#xD;
by which it happened that she beca the daughter&#xD;
of her own' sister ; and other siin lar relationships&#xD;
were formed too complicated f r my ingenuity to&#xD;
unravel. '&#xD;
As I have sa'd, no young woman, in those days,&#xD;
of any smartnes , was rnarried till she had provided&#xD;
her linen for pe sonal wear, bedding, table covering,&#xD;
towels, etc., wit her own hands. Of course these&#xD;
were 'busy days for Rosanna. Seated at her spin-&#xD;
ning-wheel by the west window, which .looked out&#xD;
upon the valley below,~ with the shining flak hang-&#xD;
ing upon the distaff before her, she spun daily her&#xD;
self-prescribed number of "runs," the soft hum of&#xD;
her instrument rising and falling in gentle cadences,&#xD;
like the murmur of a busy bee-hive 1on a sunny&#xD;
bank in June.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jsaac, the second son, had already taken to him-s&#xD;
self a.'wife. H&amp;amp; was. barely nineteen, and might,&#xD;
pne would think, have waited a few years ; but the&#xD;
sweet-faced Patience Hammond' had beguiled him,&#xD;
and most impatiently did' he count the days till he&#xD;
had made her his own. As yet she had not ree&#xD;
moved ~from her childhood's home, but .she was&#xD;
~often over at Father Judd's to .see Rosanna, and&#xD;
help her: in her tasks at the wheel and loom.&#xD;
There was a great deal of confidential intercourse&#xD;
between them, and much mysterious and low-toned&#xD;
talk in the ,aid west room, where these operations&#xD;
were carried on.&#xD;
Walter, the third~son, had gone into the army&#xD;
with his brother 'Roswell. The .next daughter,&#xD;
Appellina, now sixteen, was emphatically her moth-&#xD;
er's help. Lively an'd cheerful, she could turn her&#xD;
hand to anything,~ from the Monday'~ wash and the&#xD;
Tuesday's ironing to rnaking, a rag baby for little&#xD;
Milly, or a whistle for the chubby-faced, four-year-&#xD;
old Reuben. Chauncey came next ; then Anna and&#xD;
Ruth, the twins. These had a special charge of&#xD;
out-door~ matters? They knew all the. hens' nests&#xD;

work. "Come, girls," she would say, if any loitered&#xD;
at their tasks, "every kit must catch her mouse;"&#xD;
and she herself set the example , catching more&#xD;
than any of her daughters. The short gown and&#xD;
petticoat of checked linen, or in winter of linsey-&#xD;
woolsey, home-spun and home-woven, were their&#xD;
usual garments, except on Sunday, when a lighter&#xD;
stuff was worn, the mother and elder daughters, on&#xD;
special occasions, displaying the charms of chintz&#xD;
or calico. If the~ children at home Went bar~foot~d,&#xD;
even up to womanhood, it did not hurt them; and&#xD;
if the boys had stubbed toes and stone-bruised&#xD;

PURITAN TRAINING.&#xD;
&#xD;
N those days the means of education were&#xD;
scanty. For some years a school had&#xD;
'been established in Judel's Meadow, to&#xD;
be kept a few weeks in winter; but while the boys&#xD;
might brave5 the winds and snow to attend it, the&#xD;
task was, for the most part, too severe for the girls.&#xD;
Indeed, the acquisitions of those who did go were&#xD;
not great. Spelling,' if we, may judge from the&#xD;
specimens which have descended to us, came, a~&#xD;
Dogberry ~'ias it, "by nature," for no art could have&#xD;
taught such achievements in misplacing the a1ph~-&#xD;
bet. Reading, writing, and a small amount of&#xD;
arithmetic made up the list of the branches taught.&#xD;
Grammar, geography, and the higher branches&#xD;
common to our day were practically unknown.&#xD;

timely was needed. People lived by the strength&#xD;
of their arms, not by their stores of book knowl-&#xD;
edge; and the chief science needed was to know&#xD;
how to coa,~c from the scanty soil sufficient supplies&#xD;
for man and beast.&#xD;
Religion had its appropriate place in Isaac Judd's&#xD;
family; nay, We had almost said, was indigenous in&#xD;
every true Puritan home of the early times. The&#xD;
big'~Bible lay upon the table, ~nd from 'its throne&#xD;
of authority dispensed instruc1~on and admonition&#xD;
to the assembled household. Reverently they all&#xD;
stood as the morning and evening prayer was&#xD;
offered by the father, and when the bf~ing was&#xD;
invoked upon the meals. The Sabbath began at&#xD;
sunset on Saturday night, when all work save that&#xD;
of the most imperative necessity was laid aside.&#xD;
Qn the Lord's day, as many of the family as pos-&#xD;
sible must go to meeting. There was than no&#xD;
meeting-house nearer than Waterbury Center, the&#xD;
society at Salem not having been organized till&#xD;
1781. The distance was six miles, the i~oads rough,&#xD;
and horseback the only means of conveyance. To&#xD;
the elders of the family1 of course, it was assigned&#xD;
~o ride. Reining the steed up to the side of the&#xD;
horse-block, the father mounted first; then, adjust-&#xD;
&#xD;
her cushioned billion to the saddle, the mother&#xD;
sprung up behind him, holding herself in place by&#xD;
her arm* around her husband's waist. Lastly, the&#xD;
baby - for there was rarely an interval in that&#xD;
family when there was not a youngster of this&#xD;
designation to be cared for - was placed in its&#xD;
father's arms; and thus amply freighted, the patient&#xD;
animal to3k its jog-trot journey to the house of&#xD;
God. The young people accompanied them on&#xD;
foot with sober and reverent pace, as became the&#xD;
sacred day, none being allowed to remain at home&#xD;
unless sick, or having the care of some one else, or&#xD;
for some indispensable need of the household or&#xD;
the farm.&#xD;
The drum, vigorously beaten at the meeting-&#xD;
house door, announced the hour of worship. En~&#xD;
tearing the little sanctuary, no cushioned and car~&#xD;
peted,. pewt i~as seen, but bare benches ranged in&#xD;
two "teer" before the pulpit; one for the men, the&#xD;
other for the worsen, and "dignified according ,to&#xD;
the age anc~l wealth of the worshipers." In 1769,&#xD;
however, it had been voted that "those who are&#xD;
seated in the ~eats" should have permission, "it&#xD;
their own expense; to turn them into pews;" and&#xD;

Furnace or stove there was none, save the small&#xD;
foot-stove, containing a little pan of coals, which&#xD;
the wealthier matrons carried with them. No&#xD;
matter how severe the winter, the people, who per-&#xD;
- haps had faced the cutting winds, or waded through&#xD;
the deep snows, on their way, sat the hour and a&#xD;
half through with hero-ic fortitude. Those who&#xD;
lix~ed at a distance had, if they were able, small&#xD;

hour and a half in the unarmed meeting-house&#xD;
completed the service of the day, and they were -&#xD;
dismissed to the lbng, cold ride home.&#xD;
Did they count it a hardship thus to honor God&#xD;
in his sanctuary? No; it was a service of love, of&#xD;
unfeigned, heartfelt devotion. We know of noth-&#xD;

We love to linger amid the recollections of&#xD;
these old- Puritan families. They had their weak-&#xD;
nesses and their faults, like the rest of mankind.&#xD;
Petty vices may have existed among the lower&#xD;
classes the indolent, the shiftless, and the intern-&#xD;
perate. Poverty, toil, the- w~int of books, and re-&#xD;
moteness from cultivated society may have caused&#xD;
a lack of polish, and some coarseness of manners&#xD;
and habits. But, making all allowance for these&#xD;
things, they were the salt of the earth. These&#xD;
hard-working, God-fearing fathers and - mothers&#xD;
-wer&amp;amp; the founders of the state, and none in all&#xD;

Isaac Judd and his sons. Three of them -Ros-&#xD;
well, Isaac, and Walter -were of an age to bear&#xD;
arms, and at different times all entered into the&#xD;
army. Roswell was then a member of one of the&#xD;
militia companies of Waterbury. The British&#xD;
General Howe, having evacuated Boston, appear,ed&#xD;
in June, I776, off New York, threatening an attack&#xD;
upon that city. Congress made a requisition, on&#xD;
Connecticut for troops, and the legislature, then in&#xD;
session, authorized seven regiments of volunteers&#xD;
to be raised in that colony to~ join the Continental&#xD;
army. A few weeks later, the condition of affairs&#xD;
became so critical that' General Washington sent&#xD;
an urgent appeal for help, and the governor. of&#xD;
Connecticut responded with an order directing the&#xD;
whole body of the standing militia west of the Con-&#xD;
necticut River, and two regiments from the east&#xD;
side, to march forthwith to New York, "until the&#xD;
present exigency is over." This was substantially&#xD;
a levy ezr masse for over one half of the colony.&#xD;
"It is estimated," says Bronson, "that full one half&#xD;
of Washington's army in and about New York this&#xD;
year wereConnecticut men ; and that during this&#xD;
year (1776), the colony had in full twenty thousand&#xD;
troops in the service, xnhereas her whole available&#xD;
&#xD;
military force - from -sixteen to fifty years of'age&#xD;
-- did not exceed twenty-three thousand." 1&#xD;
The comnpanies from Waterbury arrived in season&#xD;
to take part in the disastrous battle of Long Island,&#xD;
and the various skirmishes and 'fights that followed.&#xD;

two. Called suddenly ihto the service in the sul-&#xD;
triest days of summer, stibjected to the severest&#xD;
duty in the field, resulting in defeat and retreat,&#xD;
with no proper commissary or sanitary stores, it is&#xD;
no wonder that these raw levies were unable to&#xD;
stand the hardships, and that the hospitals, such&#xD;
as they were, were speedily filled with disabled&#xD;
men. I~i these circumstances, the Connectic~t&#xD;
Assembly directed the~ governor to write to Gene&#xD;
eral Washingtdn, keq~iesting hi in, as soon as might&#xD;
be, to discharge the sick in the h~ilitia who should&#xD;
be judged incapable of further service.&#xD;
Mr. Judd, rec\~ iving intelligence of Roswell's&#xD;
sickness anddisc l~ arge under this order; hastened&#xD;
to the camp to Jo k aftei: him. He was, however~&#xD;
too ill to be at once removed; but owing to care-&#xD;
ful nursing, with a naturally vigorous constitution,&#xD;
he at length sufficiently recovered to warrant the&#xD;
journey. It was a long and toilsome undertaking.&#xD;
His father had rode from Waterbury ~on horseback.&#xD;
There were no railroads then, nor even stage&#xD;
coaches. Small vessels had been wont to sail, more&#xD;
or less frequently, from New 'Haven or Derby; but&#xD;
during these troublesome times, all regular com-&#xD;
munications of this sort were suspended. Only&#xD;
&#xD;
one way was left. Roswell was placed upon the&#xD;
back of the horse, and his father, trudged on foot&#xD;
b~ his side. ,Their progress' was slow, for the in-&#xD;
valid was too weak to ride far in a day. ~ It was&#xD;
nearly a week before they reached home - a trip&#xD;
which fnay now easily be accomplished in three&#xD;
hours.&#xD;
As the war went on, the hardships it occasioned&#xD;
were more and more felt in the homes of the peo-&#xD;
ple. As early as 1774, Congress adopted 'a series&#xD;
of resolutions pledging the delegates and inhabit-&#xD;
ants of the colonies to a system of non-intercourse&#xD;
with Great Britain, hoping, by thus depriving her&#xD;
of a market for her man ufa~tures, to compel her to&#xD;
redress their grievances. Nothing which was pro~&#xD;
duced by ,England or her colonies was to be im-&#xD;
ported or consumed. Tea, coffee, sugar, molasses,&#xD;
spices, indigo, &amp;amp;c., were to be disused. Home&#xD;
industries were to be fostered. The rich were to&#xD;
discard their silks and broadcloths, and appear in&#xD;
homespun, which, if inferior in texture and 'finish,&#xD;
was at least the product of free hands.&#xD;
To enforce this abstinence from imported goods,&#xD;
one of the resolutions of Congress recommended&#xD;
the appointment of a vigilance committee in every&#xD;

town, "whose business it shall be attentively to&#xD;
observe the conduct of all persor~s touching this&#xD;
association." If any were found violating the corn-&#xD;
pact, the case was to be "published in the Gazette,&#xD;
to the end that all such foes to the rights of British&#xD;
America may be publicly known and universally&#xD;
condemned as the enemies of American liberty;&#xD;
and thenceforth we respectively break off all deal-&#xD;
ings with him or her."&#xD;
This resolution was secon\ed by a vote of the&#xD;
town of Waterbury, in which it was agreed that&#xD;
the people would "faithfully adhere to, and strictly&#xD;
abide by, the association entered into by said Con-&#xD;
gress, and appoint the gentlemen hereafter amed&#xD;
a committee to see the same carried int6 execution&#xD;
in every article thereof.''&#xD;
It required no small courage and s~lf-denial .to&#xD;
comply fully with the terms of thi~s agreement.&#xD;
The people had few luxuries at the best, and these&#xD;
swept them all away at a blow. What could fami-&#xD;
lies do without tea, and sugar, and spices, and a&#xD;
thousand articles needed for housekeeping and for&#xD;
personal use? But necessity is the mother of&#xD;
invention. Substitutes for forbidden articles were&#xD;

little surprise at the present day~ The cider cup&#xD;
more than ever supplied the place of both coffee&#xD;
and tea, and the tall maples furnished, to those&#xD;
who possessed them, their delicious sirup and&#xD;
sugar. In the farhily of Mr. Judd, who seemed not&#xD;
to have been thus favored, the necessary "sweeten~&#xD;
ing" was procured in another way. The Indian&#xD;
corn is the botanical cousin of the sugar cane, and&#xD;
its juices, when fresh, are not without' saccharine&#xD;
qualities. So the cornstalks were cut, their leaves&#xD;
stripped off, and the stems, bruised and wrung,&#xD;
were placed in a kettle, and boiled, from which a&#xD;
coarse sirup was obtained, which helped to make&#xD;
pies and cakes palatable. 'The writer has often&#xD;
heard his relative, the venerable lady before men-&#xD;
tioned, then one, of the younger daughters of the&#xD;
family, describe this unique process, and say that&#xD;

EAR after year passed, and still the war&#xD;
dragged on. The battles Qf Trenton and&#xD;
Princeton had revived the drooping hop~s&#xD;
of the patriots, and the capture of Burgoyne had,&#xD;
gained for them the powerful assistance of France.&#xD;
Still it ivas~an exhausting struggle. Thousands of&#xD;
men we ~e called away froiti their homes and occu-&#xD;
pations, many of them ~iever to return; labor was&#xD;
interrup ted, the credit of the natio&amp;amp; depressed,&#xD;
and the prospects of a successful issue seemed as&#xD;
remote as ever. The courage of the patriots, how7&#xD;
ever, did flot fail them, and from the very prolo~ga-&#xD;
tion of the war rose a forlorn hope that the British&#xD;
cabinet would at length be convinced of the futility&#xD;
of their endeavor to conquer a people so deter-&#xD;
mined, and ultimately concede their independence.&#xD;

It was a bright 1day in March, 1780. Though&#xD;
springaccording to the calendar, it was still winter&#xD;
in fact. Snow yet covered the . ground, the buds&#xD;
showed no signs of awakening life, and the keen&#xD;
winds, blowing as only March wind~ can, kept the&#xD;
world still prisoner under the reigh of the Frost&#xD;
King.&#xD;
On the evening of that day, Judd's Meadow was&#xD;
enlivened with one of those festive occasions char-&#xD;
acteristic of the times one hundred years ago a&#xD;
quilting. A young couple of the neighborhood&#xD;
were sbon to be married, in. anticipation of which&#xD;
the bride expectant invited her friends to assist her&#xD;
in completing that most . indispensable article for&#xD;
housekeeping, a bed-quilt.&#xD;
Marvelous achievements of industry and skill&#xD;
were those ancient specimens of patch-work. By&#xD;
some inexplicable rule of computation, their value&#xD;
seems to have been estimated in exact proportion&#xD;
to the number of pieces of which they were com-&#xD;
posed. The gathering of these had been the work&#xD;
of years. They consisted lar~e1y of bits of the&#xD;
materials from which the dresses of friends and&#xD;
relatives, near and remote, had been made. Such&#xD;
a piece, you would be assured, was of ~is~er Sally's&#xD;

wedding gown, such another was from cousin Han-&#xD;

the minister's wife, that she wore on the very day&#xD;
of the ordination. This scrap was from the ward-&#xD;
robe of Lieutenant Lewis's second wife, who' was&#xD;
the' rich widow Hopkins, you know. Here was a&#xD;
bit from Mrs. ,Dr. Bird's wedding gown~ which she&#xD;
first pieced into a cradle-quilt for her eldest baby,&#xD;
et4. Of course fragments of bridal robes and baby-&#xD;
dresses were most precious of all. The fitting and&#xD;
~ewing of these had been long going on, perhaps&#xD;
even from childhood; and now, as the eventful day,&#xD;
so full of hope and promise, draws nigh,, the piecing&#xD;

Sunday, and on this blustering Tuesday afternoon&#xD;
a merry group ~of girls are assembled around the&#xD;
quilt frames in the best room. A blazing~ fire in&#xD;

task is corn pleated, the quilt cut from its frame, the&#xD;
room tidied of its disorder, ~nd all is ready to wel-&#xD;

I know not how it was that this piece of purely&#xD;
feminine industry, could never be wholly* finished&#xD;
without the aid of the young men. But such was&#xD;
the fact ; and though these did nQt participate in the&#xD;
actual labor, yet it is unquestionably true that the&#xD;
expectation ~f th~ir presence led to the production&#xD;
of many more quilts than would otherwise have been&#xD;
made. The evening was devoted to merry-making.&#xD;
Not infrequently a fiddler was engaged to officiate;&#xD;
but he was not always to be had, and indeed his&#xD;
presence was not, in the best families, quite ap-&#xD;
proved~ ~There were' plenty of plays, however, to&#xD;
supply the, lack. There was "button, button," and&#xD;

and" blind man's buff," and not least, if last, "run-&#xD;

At the quilting to which we have referred, the&#xD;
young people of the Judd, Williams, Hotchkiss,&#xD;
and other families in the town, were present;&#xD;
and on this occasion Chauncey Judd, for the first&#xD;
time in his life, ventured to .offer himself for escort&#xD;
duty~ to a young lady on her way ~home. Her name&#xD;
was Ditha Webb, and she lived about half a mile&#xD;
west from Mr. Judd's; on r the old road leading to&#xD;
Gunntown. Her father was a day laborer, working&#xD;
for the most part for ~Mr. jobarnah Gunn, the rich&#xD;
tory farmer near by. She was a sprightly girl,&#xD;
beaming with good nature, and something of a fa-&#xD;
vorite among the young folks. Her mother was&#xD;
frequently employed by th neighboring families to&#xD;
assist them on special occa~ ions, aI4d in this capa-&#xD;
city, as tailor an~ seamstress, sh~ had woilked for&#xD;
Mrs. Judd in cutting and making garments for her&#xD;
numerous household. Ditha was quite intimate&#xD;
with the girls of the family, and often found time&#xD;
of an afternoon to ramble with Anna or Ruth for&#xD;
berries and flowers in the fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chauncey was now in his sixteenth year~; tall,&#xD;
slender, with light~blue eyes and fair, brown hair.&#xD;
Naturally he had a poetic ~temperament~ though he&#xD;
knew. little of what poetry was. He felt the beauty&#xD;
of the landscape as it lay stretched out before him;&#xD;
of the hills and valleys, and the blue. arch of heaven&#xD;
above; of1 the green foliage of the summer, 'and the&#xD;
ermined mantle and hoarse voices of the winter.&#xD;
Especially did he feel the attractions of a fair face&#xD;
and a winning smile, though his own timidity made&#xD;
him repel with ingenuous blushes any1 intimation&#xD;
from his ruder companions of such~ a weakness&#xD;
as this.&#xD;
Therefore it was with a beating heart that he&#xD;
made up his mind to offer his services ~that * night&#xD;
as an escort to Ditha. He heard her voice in mer-&#xD;
ry laughter from the room whither' the girls had&#xD;
gone 'to don their hoods and cloaks, and when, with&#xD;
forced courage, he met her at the door as she came&#xD;
out, and asked, "May I have the pleasure of seeing&#xD;
you home, Ditha?" and received her prompt reply,&#xD;
"Th1ank you, Chauncey," at the same time putting&#xD;
her little mittened hand within his arm, he felt that&#xD;
he was a lucky fellow, and that Ditha was as good&#xD;
as she w~s pretty.&#xD;

They reached ~her home, as Chauncey thought,&#xD;
in an incredibly short time, and as the hour did not&#xD;
seem late, he accepted her invitation to go in. Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Webb had retired, for the night, but the&#xD;
fire stjll smoldered on the hearth, and being replen-&#xD;
ished with the wood laid in readiness for the morn-&#xD;
ing, it soon filled the room with its ruddy glow.&#xD;
Had it been a regular Sabbath e/eni'ng visit, after&#xD;
the approved mode of courtship, she would have&#xD;
made the fire in the best room; but as he only de-&#xD;
signed to remain a few minutes, that was dispensed&#xD;
with, and the kitchen where the family for the most&#xD;
part lived answered in its stead.&#xD;
But he staid longer thap he had expected.&#xD;
What were the topics of conversation 'be-&#xD;
guiled those midnight hours we cafinot affirm; we&#xD;
can only guess. They were both of an age when&#xD;
the young buds of the sweetest of all, passions&#xD;
were just beginning to swell ih their bosoms, as&#xD;
would the germs of life in the vegetable world a&#xD;
few weeks later. It was this which gave its charm&#xD;
to the interview, and made him forget both himself&#xD;
and the hour. True, 'there was no clock to tell&#xD;
him how l~.te it was, neither had he a watch, for&#xD;
both clocks and watches were luxuries' possessed&#xD;
&#xD;
only by the rich, but the full moo4 already past&#xD;
the meridian, should have sufficiently supplied their&#xD;
place.&#xD;
It must have been nearly or quite three o'clock&#xD;
before Chauncey ro .~ e to depart. Ditha took the&#xD;
candle and guided him to the back door, the only&#xD;
one used in the farmers' houses of the country dur-&#xD;
ing the winter. The good~nights were spoken, and&#xD;
~he young man started down the road homeward.&#xD;
With. a bounding step he sped along the snowy&#xD;
ath. Never did the world look so beautiful; never&#xD;
was his heart so light.&#xD;

~ path, cutting off' an aiigle of the road, and&#xD;
shortening ky a few rods the distance to his home.&#xD;
As he emerged from ~the woods upon the highway,&#xD;
he suddenly met a party of men, who had come up&#xD;
the road from the bridge, and were traveling to-&#xD;
ward Gunntown. They were all armed with mus-&#xD;
kets or halberts, and most of them' carried heavy&#xD;
packs, as of merchandise tied in bundles and slung&#xD;
upon their shoulders.&#xD;
At first Chauncey hesitated a moment; as if he&#xD;
would turn back into the woods; but the men had&#xD;
seen him the same moment that he discovered&#xD;
them, and he felt that retreat would be useless. He&#xD;
therefore drew to one side of the path,, and hastily&#xD;
68&#xD;
&#xD;
passed them, recognizing as he did so one 6r two,&#xD;
under the bright moonlight, as persons he knew,&#xD;
~i~ong whom was the young man wbose conversa-&#xD;
tion with him we have before recorded, and who as&#xD;
he passed exclaimed,&#xD;
'~ Halloo, Chauncey!     yp\~I ?"&#xD;
"Halloo, David ! "w s~the reply; but Chauncey in&#xD;
the circumstances desired no further recognition,&#xD;
and moved rapidly on.&#xD;
The men halted foi a moment in low conversa-&#xD;
tion, when another, who seemed to be their leader,&#xD;
called after him&#xD;
"Halt there, young man; we want to see you.&#xD;
For an instant Chauncey slackened his steps as&#xD;
if about to comply with the summons, but the next&#xD;
moment he started forward with quickened pace.&#xD;
"Stop !" cried the harsh voice again, with an&#xD;
oath. "Come back here, or I'll make daylight&#xD;
shine through. you." A~ the same time the sharp&#xD;
click of a gunloc k warned him that it would be no&#xD;
idle threat. The young man stopped accordingly,&#xD;
and looked around.&#xD;
"What dQ you want of me?" he asked.&#xD;
"Come back here, and we'll tell you," was 'the&#xD;
peremptory answ~r.&#xD;
&#xD;

There was o alternative but compliance, 4and he&#xD;
slowly retrace d his steps.&#xD;
"So, Chauncey," said Wooster, "you did not&#xD;
want to see your friends, it seems. But how came&#xD;
you to be here at this time of night? Where have&#xD;
you been?"&#xD;
"It's none of your business, Dave Wooster. My&#xD;
errand has been an honest one, at any rate, which&#xD;
is more, I guess, than you can say of yours."&#xD;
"Well, whatever it was, it's a pity it did not'keep&#xD;
you, a little longer, at least till we got by."&#xD;
By this time several others of the party were&#xD;
gathered round whom he knew. Most of them&#xD;
were stories belonging in Gl4nntown, but two or&#xD;
three were strangers to him. The former called&#xD;
him by name, but he answered only in monosyl1a~&#xD;
bles, as ~if feeling anything but pleasure at the in2&#xD;
terview. Very soon the harsh voice of their leader&#xD;
broke in' again:&#xD;
~' Come, young man, you must go with us."&#xD;
"With you?" exclaimed hauncey, in dismay.&#xD;
"For what?"&#xD;
"No matter now; we want you; s6 right about&#xD;
face, march!"&#xD;
"But where do you want me to go?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"We've no time to confab about it 'now," cried&#xD;
the other, with an oath. "Come ~long, and you 11,&#xD;
find out.''&#xD;
"The truth is,"~ interposed Wooster, "nobody&#xD;
knows that we are away from home to-night, and it&#xD;
wouldn't be quite convenient for us to have them.&#xD;
Might have too many asking questions about it, you&#xD;
know. Folks are mighty inquisitive sometimes."&#xD;
"Oh," said Chauncey, "is that all? I won't tell&#xD;
of you."&#xD;
"No, we don't mean you sh4Il," said the leader;&#xD;
"so, to make sure of it, we'll take you along with&#xD;
us. Come, b~ quick! Get, into the road here&#xD;
before us; we can't wait. Daylight will be along&#xD;
soon, and that is another of our friends that we&#xD;
don't care to see just now.&#xD;
It was plain' that remonstrance would be useless;&#xD;
so the young man took his way with the gang.&#xD;
The leader, whose~ name was Graham, and whose&#xD;
accent betrayed him as a foreigner, stepped for-&#xD;
ward by his side, and they walked on together, the&#xD;
rest following in the rear.&#xD;
~' Sorry to cause you ~nconveni'ence," he said,&#xD;
"and we don't mean you any harm. If you go&#xD;
along peaceably it will be the better for you, but if&#xD;

body and you should betray us, yo~i wouldn't live&#xD;
three minutes. Here are five loaded muskets, and&#xD;
you~\can calculate your chances of escape if I give&#xD;
orders to fire."&#xD;
"But," said Chauncey, "~ do trust me. ~ give you&#xD;
my word and honor that I will pever tell any living&#xD;
soul that I have seen you to-night."&#xD;
"That's very easy for you to promise," i~eplied&#xD;
Graham, "but we are too old birds to be caught'&#xD;
with chaff. We shall, as Wooster says, have peo-&#xD;
ple inquiring yery affectionately fo~ us in a day or&#xD;
two, and you could not keep the secret if you tried.&#xD;
So there's nothing~ more to be said, but come&#xD;
along."&#xD;
Thus saying, Graham pulled his slouched hat&#xD;
more closely over his face, afid bidding his men to&#xD;
" hurry up," the whole party moved rapidly dbwn&#xD;
the hill, around the corner of th&amp;amp; woods, in the&#xD;
direction of Gunntown.&#xD;
They soon reached the house of Mr. Webb, now&#xD;
wrapped in darkness and silence. Keenly did&#xD;
Chauncey feel, as they passed. it, the change in his~&#xD;
cirQumstances which the last half hour had brought.&#xD;
How little did she, who had parted from him with&#xD;
&#xD;
* soft good-bys a few minutes before, imagine that&#xD;
he had already returned, in far less agreeable&#xD;
company, and that he was being hurried away, he&#xD;
* knew not whither.&#xD;
It w~As but a short mile further when they reached&#xD;
the abode of Mr. Gunn, where they expected to&#xD;
make a halt. This wa~ a large two-story house, -&#xD;
now the residence bf a grandson of his, standing in&#xD;
a bend or hollow of the hill-side overlooking the&#xD;
'Longrneadow valley. Around it were the various.&#xD;
out-hohses usually belonging to, large farmers, for&#xD;
the kitchen~ the dairy, the wash-room, and the like.&#xD;
1.&#xD;
On arriving in sight of the house; the party&#xD;
halted for con~ultation. They were reluctant to&#xD;
call up the family at that time of the night, though&#xD;
not app~r~iitly from any doubt of the friendliness&#xD;
of the reception they might meet With. But what&#xD;
They needed just Then was rest. They had been&#xD;
up all night, had ~traveled a considerable distance'&#xD;
burdened with' their heavy guns and bundles, and&#xD;
some of them were greatly exhausted.' After a few&#xD;
moments' consultation, they decided to enter the&#xD;
large barn which sto~d by the road-side a few rods&#xD;
east of the house, and stow themselves away in&#xD;
the hay until daybreak.&#xD;

* Meanwhile the dogs, of which " Uncle Joe'"never&#xD;
had less than two or three, had discovered the&#xD;
approach of 'the strangers, and with loud barking&#xD;
had announced it to the family. The clamor was&#xD;
,redoubled in violence when some of the party went&#xD;
to the barn door, and attempted to gaini an en-&#xD;
trance. Graham tried to sdothe these vigilant cus-&#xD;
todians of ,the premises, but in vain. Caresses and&#xD;
friendly tones were unavailing ; ay, had it not been&#xD;
for the muskets and halberts Which the men car-&#xD;
ried, they would, doubtless, have been in con idera-&#xD;

Presently there were indications that the outcry&#xD;
had made- itself heard' in the house. A window&#xD;
Was raised, and a he ad thrust out with the inquiry,&#xD;
"Who's there ?"&#xD;
" Friends," answer ed Graham.&#xD;
~"What do you tw nt ?"&#xD;
" We want the privilege of lying down in your&#xD;
barn and resting till morning. We have been up&#xD;
all night, and are very tired. We should have taken&#xD;

for a day or two."&#xD;
"Then I can't say I want you here, if you have&#xD;

&#xD;
HILL these nocturnal travelers are snatch-,&#xD;
-~ ing a few minutes' sleep in Mr. Gunn's&#xD;
barn, let us explain who they are, and&#xD;
they appear here in these circumstances.&#xD;
We have already related the reasons which led&#xD;
so many of the people of Gunntown and vicinity to&#xD;
espouse the cause of the royalists.&#xD;
After the disastrous battle of Brooklyn Hights,&#xD;
and the masterly retreat of General Washingto7n&#xD;
and his forces to New York, Long Island fell&#xD;
wholly under British control. It became, in con-&#xD;
~equence, one of the haunts 'of the stories, and a&#xD;
general resort for thieves and desperadoes of every&#xD;
description.&#xD;

&#xD;
says Thompspn,1 "was followed by an abandonment&#xD;
of Long Island to the enemy; and the town and&#xD;
county commissioners) in many instances, either&#xD;
through fear or necessity, were inclined to repudi-&#xD;
ate all legislative authQri~y exercised by the Provin-&#xD;
cial and Continental Congresses. The inhabitants&#xD;
who continued on the island were compelled to&#xD;
* subscribe to the oath of allegiance and fideli tyto&#xD;
the king. General Howe had, immediately on land-&#xD;
ing at Gravescnd, issued a proclamation promising*&#xD;
security of person and property to those who should&#xD;
remain peaceably upon their farms. This island&#xD;
became, therefore, conquered territory, forts being&#xD;
erected and garrisons established in different places.&#xD;
Martial law prevailed, the army became a sanc-&#xD;
tuary for criminals of every grade, and means the&#xD;
most despicable were resorted to for increasing&#xD;
the numerical force of the enemy. Those inhabit-&#xD;
ants who had heretofore tak~n an active part as&#xD;
officers of militia and committee men deemed it&#xD;
most imprudent to remain, and consequently&#xD;
sought refuge within the American lines, leaving&#xD;
Ihe greater part of their. property exposed, to the&#xD;
ravages of an unprincipled foe.&#xD;
History,. of Long Island, vol. i6 p. 392.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The enemy took possession of the best rooms&#xD;
in their houses, and ~obliged their owners to pro-&#xD;
vide them accommodations and support$ for men&#xD;
and horses. The property of those who had fled&#xD;
* from their homes, and esPecially those engaged in,&#xD;
the American service, was particularly the object&#xD;
of rapine, and in very many instances the damages&#xD;
were immense."&#xD;
Among the person~ who thus fled from the&#xD;
island was a man named EBENEZER DAYTON. He&#xD;
was a native of Brookhaven, a descendant of Rev.&#xD;
Nathaniel Brewster, D. D., one of its first minis-&#xD;
ters, and connected with some of the most respec-&#xD;
table families in 'the town. He had long carried&#xD;
on mercantile business there, not only at his own&#xD;
store in Brookhaven, but alsd by traveling tours&#xD;
in adjacent towns, in. consequence of which he&#xD;
became extensively known throughout the middle&#xD;
and eastern portions of the island. The following&#xD;
amusing incident, related by Thompson, will give&#xD;
us a glimpse of the manner in which the business&#xD;
of a country tradesman was then carried on, and&#xD;
the perils to which it was liable -&#xD;
"Dayton arrived in the village of Easthampton,&#xD;
on Saturday evening, with a stock of fancy goods&#xD;

indisposition res ambling the measles; but for the&#xD;
pui5pose of apprising the people of his presence,&#xD;
and against the earnest remonstrance of his land~&#xD;
lady, he made his appearance next day at church,&#xD;
and placed himself, of course, in the most cot~spic-'&#xD;
uous part of the assembly. Meeting was no sooner&#xD;
dismissed in the afternoon than a rumor of his&#xD;
ihdisposition was spread through the town ; and&#xD;
the general indignation was s~ apparent that the&#xD;
delinquent, considering prudence the better part&#xD;
of valor, departed early the next morning.&#xD;
"But the incensed population was not so easily'&#xD;
satisfied. A few ardent youngsters set off in pur-&#xD;
suit, and overtaking the peddler on the road, seized&#xD;
and brought him back to the village, and having&#xD;
paraded him through .th5 principal streets on a rail,&#xD;
dren hing him thoroughly in the town pond, and&#xD;
corn hitting other indignities upon him, permitted&#xD;
him to depart: The terrors of the law were speed~&#xD;

&#xD;
by the people, seeing that near one hundred per-&#xD;
sons took the~ disease, of whom several died. The~&#xD;
era is still alluded to as the time of the Dayton&#xD;
measles."&#xD;
Mr. Dayton espoused the American cause, and&#xD;
was very active in the measures taken to protect&#xD;
the towns and villages in that part of Long Island,&#xD;
and to annoy the British troops and stories. He&#xD;
was clerk of the Committee of Safety appointed by&#xD;
Brookhaven, under the authority of the Provincial'&#xD;
Congress, to apprehend and punish traitors. In'&#xD;
1776, he was commissioned as quartermaster in&#xD;
the regiment raised in that county. Of course he&#xD;
had become exceedingly obnoxioUs tp the royalists,&#xD;
and when 'Brookhaven fell into~, the hands of the&#xD;
enemy, he removed, with his merchandise, to Con-&#xD;
necticut. At that time' the intercourse between&#xD;
Brookhaven and the main coast was very frequent.&#xD;
There were family ties connecting' the people of&#xD;
that town with Derby; indeed, it had formerly'&#xD;
itself been withiA the Connecticut jurisdiction for&#xD;
several years. At first Dayton fixed his abode at&#xD;
Milford, but in view of the exposed position ~f this&#xD;
place to an attack' by ~ea7 he shortly ~fterWar4&#xD;
remQved some ten or twelve mile~ inland, to what&#xD;

is now Bethany, then a part of ~he ancient territory&#xD;
of New Haven.&#xD;
But notwithstanding the removal of his family&#xD;
*   and goods to this supposed place of safety, he did&#xD;
not personally abandon the scene of conflict. Un-.&#xD;
*   der a privateer's commission, he raised parties of&#xD;
men with whom he made frequent incursions upon'&#xD;
the enemy. Expeditions of this kind were very&#xD;
common at that time. "Most parts of the island~'~&#xD;
says Thompson, "and particularly along the Sound,&#xD;
suffered ~greatly from depredations of little bands&#xD;
*   of piratical plunderers, designated wludc-bocttrnei,&#xD;
from the fact of their craft resembling those used&#xD;
in whaling along the shore. With this they would&#xD;
make frequent descents under, cover of night, at-&#xD;
tack detached houses, rifle the inhabitants of thei#~&#xD;
money, plate, and other valuables, and availing&#xD;
themselves of the speed of their boats, reach their&#xD;
lurking-.place3 among th~ islands of th~ Sound, or&#xD;
upon the main shore, before any effectual means&#xD;
could be t~.ken to intercept {hem. Indeed, so gre~t.t&#xD;
was the apj~rehension of these sudden~ attacks that&#xD;
mapy of the inhabitants had their dodrs and .win-&#xD;
dows protected by iron~bars, and it became usual&#xD;
&#xD;
for people to pass the night in the woqds and other&#xD;
secret places to avoid personal violence." 1&#xD;
One of these expeditions, in which Dayton was&#xD;
engaged, is thus described in the New York Gazette&#xD;
for February i6, £778:-&#xD;
"At txvo o'clock last Thursday morning, a party&#xD;
of twelve rebels seized 'at Coram, in Suffolk County&#xD;
[in Brookhaven], two wagons loaded with dry goods,&#xD;
the property of Qbadiah Wright, of Southampton.&#xD;
These marauders had been several days on the&#xD;
island, visited most parts, and committed man&#xD;
robberies, especially at the house of Colonel Floyd,&#xD;
Setau~ket, which they robbed of goods and cash to&#xD;
*&#xD;
a considerable amount, and took some property of&#xD;
Mr. Dunbar, who rides down the island occasionally,&#xD;
and happened to lodge in the house that night."&#xD;
Communication between the town~ on the east-&#xD;
ern part of the island and New York city was then,&#xD;
for the most part, carried on in small vessels, which&#xD;
transported provisions, forage, wood, etc., for the&#xD;
use of the British army, and brought back gro-&#xD;
ceries, dry goods, aii.d money in payment.. These&#xD;
vessels, therefore, became a coveted article of plun-&#xD;

der to parties like those above described. Mr.&#xD;
Dayton had already captured no less than twelve&#xD;
of them, which were condemned as lawful prize of&#xD;
war, and had becom known am~g the British&#xD;
and their adherents under the designation of a&#xD;
"rebel pirate."&#xD;
NQr was he held in much better estimation on&#xD;
the patriot side. It was strongly ~hspected l~hat,&#xD;
of the large quantities of goods brought by him&#xD;
from th~ island, no small part was procured by&#xD;
smuggling, and sometimes even by the robbery of&#xD;
persons friendly to the American cause. The twd&#xD;
wagon loads mentioned above ~vere replQvied by&#xD;
Mr. Wright, their owner, in the Supreme Court&#xD;
at New Haven, and recoveredon the ground of his&#xD;
4.&#xD;
fidelity to his country. Other goods in Dayton's&#xD;
possession were attached on similar allegation's;&#xD;
and although he claimed that he had received them'&#xD;
in payment of a debt' 'due to him, the plea was dis-&#xD;
e&#xD;
allowed, and the goods fOrfeit~k&#xD;
'The result, as a whole, was, that Mr. Dayton' was.1&#xD;
in ill odor on both 'sides. By. the royalists he was&#xD;
feared and hated as a "rebel pirate," and by the&#xD;
Americans suspected as a smuggler and indiscrim-.&#xD;
inat~ plunderer of friend and foe. So keenly did&#xD;
&#xD;
he feel this general odium, th~it, while som~ of the&#xD;
aforesaid cases were pending in the courts, he pre-&#xD;
pared an elaborate defense ,of 'his conduct, which,&#xD;
with numerous affidavits from persons in Brook-&#xD;
haven, Derby, Stamford, etc., ho caused to be pub-&#xD;
lished' in the Connecticut Journal of April 12, 1780.&#xD;
It seems due to his reputation, and will ~at the same&#xD;
time most forcibly exhibit his standing in the 'corn-&#xD;
munity, to quote a few passages from this state-&#xD;
ment:&#xD;
"The parties against me in the eight fore-men-&#xD;
tinned suits [for smuggling], and the said sixteen&#xD;
traitors indicted for treason [including the robbers&#xD;
and their friends mentioned in' .the next chapter],&#xD;
being a very great number of persons, all imagine&#xD;
it of great importance to, them in the several trials&#xD;
depending to slander me, and that their conduct&#xD;
will appear less dishonorable and not so criminal&#xD;
if they can~make me appear extremely odious and&#xD;
detestable in the opinions of the good people of&#xD;
this state for which purposes they have jointly&#xD;
employed all their arts of corruption and 'falsehood,&#xD;
together with their interest and friends, to raise a&#xD;
popular clamor against me by' propagating and&#xD;
spreading the following reports, viz., that I am a&#xD;

tory, and as such have carried immense 'quantities&#xD;
of pr0x~isi0ns to the enemy.; that I am a pkin-&#xD;
der~r, and have robbed the people of Long Island&#xD;
to a ~r~at amouPt; that, before I fled from the&#xD;
~ island, T was worth nothing; and that all the prop-&#xD;
erty I have had taken from me, and what I yet&#xD;
have, was procured by feeding the enemy an4&#xD;
plundering on Long Island; and that, therefore, it&#xD;
is just and right for anybody, either whig or tory,&#xD;
to plunder me of my property; and that I ought to&#xD;
be considered as outlawed, and not entitled to pro-&#xD;
tection of person or property. And as I am a&#xD;
refugee stranger, without friends or connections in&#xD;
this state, while the parties secretly propagating&#xD;
these reports are nPmerous, and consistitig of&#xD;
whigs and stories, they have succeeded so far in&#xD;
spreading these reports that they are generally&#xD;
believed wh~re I am not known, and by many of&#xD;
those who live near me, to that degree that I am in&#xD;
* constant fear that my life and property are in dan-&#xD;
ger, and on that' account have been induced to&#xD;
keep an armed guard many nights fo~ my defense."&#xD;
Mr. Dayton then proceeds to declare 'solemnly&#xD;
that, except the capture of twelve vessels and the&#xD;
seizure of Mr. Wright's goods, - in ~he latter case&#xD;
&#xD;
acting only as a private of the party, and not the&#xD;
commander, - he knows of "none the least foun-&#xD;
dati9n in truth for any . of. the fore-mentioned re-&#xD;
ports." The affidavits of his friends were to the&#xD;
effect that they knew him to have been a merchant&#xD;
at Brookhaven, who had been in the habit of' selling&#xD;
goods on credit; that he went to the island only to*&#xD;
collect what was due to him .; also, that they had&#xD;
never heard that he had plundered anybody of&#xD;
either party, though they acknoxvledg~d that his&#xD;
reputation in, this respect is greatly injured among&#xD;
people ?~ all ranks and denominations, etc.&#xD;
It is impossible~ at this day to determine the&#xD;
truth in respect to this matter, nor is it of great&#xD;
importance in its ration to our story. It is&#xD;
enough that such were the opinions generally en-&#xD;
tertained of Dayton at this time, especially among&#xD;
the stories. These opinions, with the current belief&#xD;
that he had in his dwelling-house a large amount&#xD;
of money and valuable goods, undoubtedly led to&#xD;
the perpetration of the outrage we are now to&#xD;
record.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROBBERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
PON the high bluff of land, a little east&#xD;
of the present village of Seymour, stood,&#xD;
~ in J 780, a tavern of some, celebrity, kept&#xD;
by a man named Tural Whittemore. This locality'&#xD;
was, and we believe still is, called "Indian Hill,"&#xD;
having once been the residence of a remnant of a&#xD;
tribe of the Milford Indians, of whorri the lands in&#xD;
this vicinity were purchased. Thejr sachem was&#xD;
Mauwee, named by the English settlers 'Joe Chuse,&#xD;
it is said from the manner in which1 he pronounced&#xD;
the word "choose;" and from him the settlement&#xD;
was often called "Chuse-town." It was a part of&#xD;
the ancient town of' Derby, which then included&#xD;
what is now Derby, Ansonia, Seymour, and the&#xD;
larger portion of Oxford.&#xD;
About a mile south of Whittemore's tavern re-&#xD;
*88&#xD;
&#xD;
sided Henry Wooster, a brother of David Wooster,&#xD;
of Gunntown, of John and Thomas Wooster, in&#xD;
what is now Oxford,. and of Daniel Wooster, of&#xD;
Derby. Like his brothers, he was a tory, and had&#xD;
become highly obnoxious to his patriotic neighbors,&#xD;
not only from his political sentiments, but from&#xD;
having, like so many others of the royalists, been&#xD;
ready to harbor and assist those who went from&#xD;
thence to join the British army.&#xD;
On the Saturday evening preceding, the events&#xD;
recorded in chapter seventh, a number of young&#xD;
men were gathered at the tavern above mentioned.&#xD;
Among them were a son ~f Mr. Wooster's,' Henry&#xD;
Wooster, Jr., his cousin, David Wooster, Jr., fr6m&#xD;
Gunntown, and Samuel Doolittle, belonging in&#xD;
Litchfield, but then living near by, within the lim-&#xD;
its of New Haven. Other persons of the neigh-&#xD;
borhood were 'there also, drawn in by the usual&#xD;
attractions of a country town. The blazing fire in&#xD;
the bar-room, with the store of good things in the&#xD;
bar itself, made it a favorite place for passing the&#xD;
winter evenings while the progress of the war and&#xD;
the latest news from the army and from England&#xD;
were related, and all the petty gossip of the town&#xD;
indulgedd in. Sometimes, though not often, dis-&#xD;

THE ROBBERS.             91&#xD;
&#xD;
putes arose between those of opposite. politics; for&#xD;
such was the severity 'of the laws and the danger&#xD;
of expressing sentiments adverse to the popular&#xD;
side, that the more discreet stories were either v9ry&#xD;
moderate in the utterance £ their opinions, or&#xD;
altogether silent in the pres nce of others.&#xD;
In the course of the evei~ ink, there entered a&#xD;
0&#xD;
couple of travelers, who asked. for accommodations&#xD;
for Phe night. Their request was granted; and&#xD;
after they had had supper, a place was m~de for&#xD;
them in the circle which surrounded the huge, 'hos-&#xD;
p~table fireplace. They were strangers to the town,&#xD;
and one of them, who seemed to be spokesman for&#xD;
both, was, from his speech, apparently an old-coun-&#xD;
try man. Neither of them entered much into the&#xD;
conversation at first, but sat listening attentively&#xD;
to, what was said by the others, and closely ob-&#xD;
serving the' persons that spoke.&#xD;
After a little while, the stranger, who had given&#xD;
his name to the inn-keeper as Graham, inquired if&#xD;
any one present knew a Captain Dayton, formerly&#xD;
of Long Island, who, it was believed, kept a store&#xD;
somewhere in that vicinity.&#xD;
The reply, of course, was in the affirmative. No&#xD;
man, certainly, ~was better ~known to the stories of&#xD;
Derby,. and none more intensely hated than he..&#xD;
&#xD;
Without explaining 'the reason of the inquiry,&#xD;
the conversation 'turned at once upon the exploits&#xD;
of Dayton in his privateering expeditions.' This&#xD;
was a subject with which Graham seemed quite&#xD;
farniliai; and he related 'at length the particulars&#xD;
of one of the latest of these e4edition~,, in which&#xD;
he was supposed to have brought home a large&#xD;
stock of goods procured by plunder on Long&#xD;
Island. ~raharn affected much admiration at the&#xD;
adroit manner in which this had been done, and&#xD;
of the just retaliation thus inflicted upon those&#xD;
who scrupled not, whenever they had an oppor-&#xD;
tunity, to plunder the whigs. This drew out from&#xD;
many of those present a strong, dissent from those~&#xD;
opinions, "and unmeasured denunciations of the&#xD;
man and all his proceedings. 'In the 'course of&#xD;
the evening, the strangers thus obtained full knowl-&#xD;
edge of the sentiments of all present, while at the&#xD;
same time managing to cor~ceal their own.&#xD;
At length one after another of the company de-&#xD;
parted, ahd the two strangers, with Henry and&#xD;
David, remained alone. Even the landlord had&#xD;
retired, leaving his place appliedd by a fellow named&#xD;
Wooing, who lived 'near by, and was for the most&#xD;
part employed in the' service of Mr. Whittemore as&#xD;

b\ar-keeper, hostler, and, general assistant~ in the&#xD;
establishment. The hour was waxing kite, and the&#xD;
two Woosters rose, as if to go, when Graham, with&#xD;
a sudden change of manner, said,&#xD;
"Don't go yet, friends; let me shave a little, pri-&#xD;
vate talk with you.&#xD;
"Oh, certainly," replied Henry, resuming his&#xD;
seat; "what do you want ~"&#xD;
"Can I trust you with a secret?"&#xD;
"Depends upon what it is. You are strangers&#xD;
to us, and may have many secrets that we'd better&#xD;
not meddle with. However, xx~e can keep anything,&#xD;
I guess, that ought to be kept; so go ahead."&#xD;
~' Be your own judges, then, as to that. I'm not&#xD;
afraid to trust you, at any rate. If I mistake not,&#xD;
you are on the loyal side in this war that's going&#xD;
on, and don't approve o the rebellion. Isn't that&#xD;
so&#xD;
"Well, supposi~L~s; what then ?"&#xD;
~' I want to get a ~xv just such young fellows as&#xD;
you two are to join~us in a little adventure."&#xD;
Then dropping his voice to a whisper, and draw~&#xD;
ing his chair nearer to his auditor, he continued,&#xD;
"I have a commission from General Howe, as&#xD;
Iieute2ant in his majesty's service, ~to raise recruits&#xD;
&#xD;
from among those who are well affected to him.&#xD;
Here are the enlistment papers. Give me your&#xD;
names, and those of any others you know of the&#xD;
right sort, and then I will show you a nice thing&#xD;
to be done. That young man who was with you&#xD;
here Doolittle I think he was called - is one. of&#xD;

"Oh, Sam? 1-Ic's my cousin,"' replied David, "and&#xD;
a first-rate fellow, too, though I do say it. But&#xD;
what 'is this affair you make so much of? What's&#xD;
to be done, any way?"&#xD;
"The barkeeper is listening," whispered Gra~&#xD;
ham's companion, at the same time pointing over&#xD;
his shoulder to Wooding, who stood observing the&#xD;
company. ~,&#xD;
"Never mind him," said Henry; "he's all right&#xD;
- an't you, Lem?" he added, turning to the latter.&#xD;
"Come and sit down here, and hear what this gen-&#xD;
tleman has to propose to such fellows as we&#xD;
stories, you know4"&#xD;
Thus invited, Wooding drew near the party and&#xD;
listened.&#xD;
"You know," resumed Graham, "where this&#xD;
Captain Dayton lives, you say?"&#xD;
Certainly."&#xD;

"And it is not far distant from here ?"&#xD;
"No ; . up in. Bethany a little way - four or five&#xD;

"And he's got a houseful of stolen goods carried&#xD;
off from the island, and any quantity of money,&#xD;
too not your miserable Continental trash, but&#xD;

Yes; I s'pose so."&#xD;
"And there's nobody or at least not more&#xD;
than twd or three - t~gu'ard it ?" -&#xD;
Oh, that's what you are up to - is it? " in-&#xD;
terposed David. "But I thoPght just now you&#xD;
was a friend of th~ old pirate. You seemed to be&#xD;
a great admirer of him, at any rate." I&#xD;
"Ah, well ; it isn't always safe to' trust to ap-&#xD;
pearances, especially in such times as these. We&#xD;
did not want to 'show ourselves till we were sure&#xD;
of oiiir men, yoh know. But what do you think&#xD;
of my proposal, now that we understand one&#xD;
another?"&#xD;
" Well, I must *sayj replied Henry, "it might&#xD;
not be a bad thing to do. We should get a good&#xD;
haul, I've no manner of doubt, and pay off the old&#xD;
man in some f his own coin too. Rather a skittish&#xD;
business tho iiigh. He's smart, you may depend&#xD;
~'~* 1&#xD;
&#xD;
on't ;' and besides, a pretty uproar it would make&#xD;
in all the. region~ about here. Then, what should&#xD;
we do with the things ? ~'&#xD;
"Carry them back to the island with us," said&#xD;
Graham ?"~&#xD;
"And what object would there be in that? They&#xD;
would do us no good there, unless. we should go&#xD;
there ourselves to stay."&#xD;
"And that's just what you'd better do. Come&#xD;
now; I am authorized to offer you liberal bounties&#xD;
if you join the army. We hayc several regiments&#xD;
of loyal Americans in the service, you know. Of&#xD;
course King George is going to whip the rebels&#xD;
yet, even if it takes an age to do it. There will be&#xD;
plenty of confiscations then, and those who have&#xD;
sto6d true and loyal, and, much more, they who&#xD;
have he'li~ed put clown the rebellion, will be re-&#xD;
warded. Come, landlQrd, make us a good stiff&#xD;
toddy, all round, of your best okl Jamaica. 'And&#xD;
while he's doing that, put down your names here,&#xD;
and we'll drink success to 'the good cause.&#xD;
"No,~' said David; "we are not quite ready for&#xD;
that yet. Old folks wouldn't consent. But I'll&#xD;
tell y6u what we can do. Carry the things up to&#xD;

ton'll believe it's somebody from Long Jsland come&#xD;
to be revenged on him, and never think of chasing&#xD;
up there for them. And even if he should, we&#xD;
could ourselves just come down the other way, by&#xD;
Hawkins' to the landing~ 1~elow here, and slip&#xD;
across to the island till the a air should blow over."&#xD;
It is, not necessary to de ail the conversation&#xD;
"further. The feasibility of the project wa~ fully&#xD;
considered, with its difficulties and dangers. The&#xD;
young men did not believe it would be safe to make&#xD;
the attempt without a considerable force. Henry&#xD;
said it was well known that there were other per-&#xD;
sons from the island stopping~at Captain Dayton's&#xD;
t&#xD;
who were doubtless armed, and they could not&#xD;
hope to succeed without having men enough to&#xD;
overcome them at once. David only wished that&#xD;
thi~ee or four of h~5 friends, whom he named, were&#xD;
there,~and he would haven fear for the result.&#xD;
The conclusion they finally reached was, that&#xD;
David should ~go next day to Gurintown, and see&#xD;
what he could do in raising a sufficient force for&#xD;
the undertaking. Henry would in the mean time&#xD;
communicate the scheme to Doolittle, and enlist&#xD;
his co-operation, and make also such preparatiowas&#xD;
should, seem necessary. Wooing pleaded that he&#xD;
&#xD;
could not join them because he could not leave the&#xD;
tavern, nor his family, but he would do what he&#xD;
could to, help, and Graham and his companion&#xD;
might come and stay in his house - a small hut&#xD;
on a lonely back, street nearly half a mile distant -&#xD;
till David's return.&#xD;
Accordingly, next mor~1ing, David hastened&#xD;
home.! That day was the Sabbath, and a violent&#xD;
storm from the north-east of" hail, snow, sleet, and&#xD;
rain," ~ prevailed nearly all day. He, however, con-&#xD;
trived to see several of the persons he 'desired, and&#xD;
succeeded in indi~icing two of. them, Jesse Cady,&#xD;
and Amasa Scott,' to join in the expedition. A&#xD;
third, William Seeley, offered to do the same, but&#xD;
the. others objected. Seeley was comparatively an&#xD;
old maw. He had been a soldier in the French&#xD;
war twenty years before, and it was feared that he&#xD;
was i~o longer equal, to the undertaking. It was&#xD;
foreseen that the attempt would task all their&#xD;
strength, and they did not wish to be encumbered&#xD;
with one who, however zealous in intention, might&#xD;
lack in power of endurance, and possibly prove an&#xD;
incumbrance rather than a help.&#xD;

Itis a part of the wickedness o war, especially a&#xD;
civil war, that it copfounds all he distinctions of&#xD;
right and wrong, and both permits and encourages&#xD;
acts, which, in other circumstances, would' be con-&#xD;
demned as crime. An outrage committed by an&#xD;
opposing party is often made a justification for a&#xD;
similar, or even greater outrage in retaliation.&#xD;
The necessary violence of regular military opera-&#xD;
tions is made a pretext for multitudes of acts which&#xD;
can have no 'bearing on the final issue of the con-&#xD;
test, and can ~ei~ve only to inflict pain or annoyance&#xD;
on a foe. We remember the indignant sentiments&#xD;
expressed by a Confederate officer in4 the late war&#xD;
at the wanton cruelties inflfrted by some of General&#xD;
Sherman's troops in their rna~rch through ~Georgia.&#xD;
A valued family picture, the portrait of an 'officer&#xD;
of the 'RevoJution, was not onl\~ carried away, but,&#xD;
*    grown tired of the burden, tl~ e plunderer tore it&#xD;
from 'the frame and nailed, it ~upon a tree by the&#xD;
rpad..side as a mark to shoot a~. Such barbarities&#xD;
are indeed war, but it is~ war against civilization,&#xD;
and all the sentiments which distingui ~h an honor-&#xD;
able soldier from an untutored savage.&#xD;
We are slow to believe that the young men who&#xD;
were persuaded into this scheme of robbery by the&#xD;
&#xD;
renegade Graham were deliberate thieves, in their&#xD;
own understanding of the term. They would&#xD;
doubtless have revolted from 'perpetrating an ordi-&#xD;
nary burglary.~ Their friends, too, fop David did&#xD;
not hesitate, to disclose the scheme to hi~ father&#xD;
and others at Gunntown, and consult them as to&#xD;
the course to be pursued in certain contingencies,&#xD;
-wouldneverhaveencouraged~nordinaryact'of~&#xD;
1~&#xD;
crime. But Daytow had been so active in plunder-&#xD;
ing the British and tl~eir tory sympathizers, that to&#xD;
plunder 'him in turn was deemed only fair play. It&#xD;
was, as they phrased it, "paying the old pirate in&#xD;
his own coin." A few hui~dred pounds apiece, in&#xD;
money and valuable goods, it x~jild be pleasant to&#xD;
have; and if ti~ey only escaped the clutches of the&#xD;
rebel laws, - which for them had no moral force, -&#xD;
why need they trouble their consciences as to the&#xD;
way~ they obtained them? We are sorry 'to say&#xD;
that' not a few articles of value found their way&#xD;
from southern cities, during the late rebellion,&#xD;
whose possession was justified on precisely similar&#xD;
grounds.&#xD;
On Monday i~ight, the storm haVing abated,&#xD;
David Wooster and his tx~o associates started for&#xD;

(gi APTAIN DAYTON'S residence was on&#xD;
,X~the eastern side of the meeting-house&#xD;
~ ~ Green, about three fourths of a mile south&#xD;
from the present churches in Betlpany. At a later&#xD;
period it became. they abode of Colonel Elihu San-&#xD;

long known as among the most respectable citizens&#xD;
of New Haven. On the other sides of the Green&#xD;
were the 'houses. of the pastor, Rev. Mr. Hawley,&#xD;
and the physician,.Dr. Hezekiah Hooker.&#xD;
The party described in the last chapter reached&#xD;

Were seven in number, viz.: Alexander' Graham,&#xD;

tin, his real name not being known to us. Graham&#xD;
was armed with a pistol; two or three of the others&#xD;
carried muskets. The moon shone brightly, and&#xD;
the newly-fallen snow, which covered the ground,&#xD;
rendered the' night almost as light ~s the day.&#xD;
Lights were still visible ~it the houses across the&#xD;
Green,, and it was apparent that the work in hand&#xD;
must be performed as noiselessly as possible, and&#xD;
without permitting any member of the household to&#xD;
escape. It was agreed that entrance should b&amp;amp;&#xD;
effected into the bed-room where Dayton would&#xD;
probably b~ sleeping, and while two of the party&#xD;
remained in charge of him, the rest were to pass&#xD;
directly through into the chambers, and seize upon&#xD;
the men who might be lodged there. These were&#xD;
to be secured at whatever cost, while the women&#xD;
and children of the family should be frightened into&#xD;
silence, but not otherwise hurt.&#xD;
The attack, as thus planned, was carried into&#xD;
execution. Stationing one of their number outsi~1e&#xD;
to give an alarm in case of danger, Graham pro-&#xD;
cured a heavy bludgeon from the wood-pile, and&#xD;
with a single blow dashed in the bed-room window,&#xD;
sashes and all, through which he instantly sprang,&#xD;
followed by the rest. Fortunately for them, neither&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain Dayton nor the other persons supposed to be&#xD;
staying there were at home. The former had gone&#xD;
to Bostqn on business, and the latter had, a day or&#xD;
two before, removed with their effects to Water-&#xD;
bury. In fact, there was no one in the house at&#xD;
that time but Mrs. Dayton, three young children,&#xD;
one an infant six months old, and two young cob&#xD;
ored servants, a boy and a girl. The robbers were&#xD;
thus spared the sever e, perhaps bloody, struggle&#xD;
which they anticipated.&#xD;
Graham sprang, to the bed, and Jefore Mrs. Day-&#xD;
ton could recover from her fright, c lapped his hand&#xD;
over her mouth, commanding her to be silent on&#xD;
pam of instant death, at the same time assuring her&#xD;
that if she obeyed no personal violence was intend-&#xD;
ed to her or her children. The rest of the gang,&#xD;
meanwhile, searched the chambers above, but found&#xD;
nobody.&#xD;
After again charging Mrs. Dayton on her life to&#xD;
give no ala'rrn, Graham retired from the bed-room,&#xD;
to afford hdr an opportunity to throw qn her&#xD;
clothes; but the instinct of fear proved too strong&#xD;
for her prudence, and, rushing to, the broken window,&#xD;
* she shrieked, "Murder! Help!" hoping that her&#xD;
voice might be heard by the neighbors' across the&#xD;

Green. It was afterward ascertained that such&#xD;
was the fact, but owing to the distance and the mur-&#xD;
mur of the rude March wind, the sound was not&#xD;
heeded. With a terrible oath, Graham burst again&#xD;
into the room, and seizing tehe frantic lady by the&#xD;
~arm, drew her into the family room, 4nd placed her&#xD;
in a chair; then set David Wooster by her side with&#xD;
a musket pointed at her breast, and orders to fir&amp;amp;&#xD;
if she moved or made the least noise again. Her&#xD;
infant child, which had been keepingg by her side,&#xD;
was now awake and crying, to get rid of which he&#xD;
carried it out and deposited it. in her arms; then&#xD;
ordering the sheets tp be torn into strips, he bound&#xD;
her feet together, and tied her into the chair where&#xD;
she was sitting. The other children and~ servants&#xD;
were gathered into the same room and placedunder&#xD;
* Wooster's surveillance, with the assurance that if&#xD;
they did not keep still they should have the sharp&#xD;
bayonet put through them on the spot.&#xD;
The xyay was now prepared for work, and right&#xD;
vigorously did they set about it. They were in&#xD;
high spirits at the success they had achieved, and&#xD;
* the apparent ease with which the adventure was&#xD;
* likely to be completed. From cellar to attic th9&#xD;
house was rans~cked. Large quantities of goods&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
4were found, and the most valuable packed into&#xD;
sacks and bundles. They were mostly manufac~&#xD;
tured articles of foreign production coats, cloaks,&#xD;
ladies' gowns,. laces, worsted hose, silk handker~&#xD;
chiefs, hollands or linen goods, several pairs of&#xD;
silver shoe-buckles, a spy-glass, two muskets with&#xD;
accouterments, four halberds, a sort of pike with a&#xD;
hatchet near the point, etc. Much that they could&#xD;
not take away was destroyed. Diligent search was&#xD;
made for money; chests and closets were broken&#xD;
open, and every place where it seemed likely to be&#xD;

Nor was this all. Their fatigue and excitement&#xD;
had given them keen appetites, which they resolved&#xD;
to appease before they left. The servants weve&#xD;
ordered to bring upon the table in the ~kitchen&#xD;
whatever the pantry and cellar afforded, one~ of the&#xD;
men accompanying them, to make ~ure of their&#xD;
obedience and silence. Others, seizing .a light,&#xD;
went below tQ see what they could find. Liquors&#xD;

* being opened, so that the earth received their&#xD;
contents.&#xD;
During their repast, a brief consultation was&#xD;
held as to th~ expediency of setting fire to the&#xD;
* house, and so completing the woi~k of devastation&#xD;
which they had begun. But there were practical&#xD;
difficulties in the way. Graham was hard ned&#xD;
hesitated&#xD;
enough'for any crime, and would not have&#xD;
to murder the whole family, and leave them a prey&#xD;
to the flames. . But the rest were less abandoned&#xD;
in villainy than he. Whatever was necessary for&#xD;
the accomplishment of their purpose they would&#xD;
have done,~ but deliberate and needless cruelty th~y&#xD;
shrunk from. They concluded, therefore, to leave&#xD;
Mrs. Dayton and the servants securelybound, with&#xD;
one of their number to guard' them, until the re-&#xD;
mainder, with their heavy luggage, had gone out of&#xD;
sight; when ~'he could follow at a. rapid pace and&#xD;
overtake them.&#xD;
Having, at last, satisfied their appetites, the rob-&#xD;
* bers shouldered their packages and departed, first&#xD;
charging the lady, with fearful threats, not to at-&#xD;
tempt giving an ~alarm, or to leave the house till&#xD;
morning. They did not start in the direction they&#xD;
intended to go, but set off westward, as if bound&#xD;
&#xD;
again for Derby; but after a half mile, they turned&#xD;
northward by a side highway, and soon emerged&#xD;
upon the main road leading to Wat~erbury.&#xD;
Meanwhile L~avid Wooster, who had remained&#xD;
to g~iard Mrs. Dayton, not satisfied with what had&#xD;
already been accomplished, executed a little swp-&#xD;
plementary plundering on his own account.. As&#xD;
she sat bound, in undress, before him, his cupidity&#xD;
was excited by the personal adornments which she&#xD;
wore in rather unusual profusion. He stripped the&#xD;
rings from her fingers, the jewels from her ear~, A&#xD;
pair of go~d sleeve-buttons from her chemise, and&#xD;
a string of gold beads, with a locket attached, from&#xD;
her neck. The lady was highly indignant at this&#xD;
(    outrage, which she r~gardcd as a person~i insult;&#xD;
but her anger availed no more than her fright.&#xD;
Having accomplished this; and deeming his coin-&#xD;
rades by this time sufficiently adVanced on their&#xD;
way, he bade her good night, and hastenecj onwar&amp;amp;&#xD;
to overtake them.&#xD;
It was now past midnight. The air was sharp,&#xD;
the road, in some places, blocked with snow, and a&#xD;
hard two or three hours' journey was before them.&#xD;
What they most feared was, that they might meet&#xD;
some person on the way, especially as the bright~.&#xD;

alarmed; but by keeping a* sharp lookout, and.&#xD;
hiding in the bushes or behind a fence, they man-&#xD;
aged to escape notice. Lights wer~e occasionally&#xD;
visible in the~houses they passed, and several times&#xD;
they excited a violent barking from the ~dogs; but&#xD;
silence and speed were their best friends. Passing&#xD;
through the wild gorge of the Beacon; Mountain,&#xD;
usually denominated the "Straits," they reached&#xD;
,/~ t1~ "*bridge" in Judd's meadow, where they turned&#xD;
westward toward Gunntown, and shortly after met&#xD;

&#xD;
GUNN'S BARN. ~&#xD;
&#xD;
T was full sunrise the next morning, be-&#xD;
fore the robbers, in Mr. Gunn's barn,&#xD;
awoke. The severe toil of the preceding&#xD;
night, coupled with the lack of sleep, had thor-'&#xD;
oughly exhausted them, and they continued in&#xD;
those heavy slumbers, which are usual to strong&#xD;
men overcome by fatigue. At last the broad day-&#xD;
light, the crowing of the cocks, and the bustle con-&#xD;
nected with a large farm-house, aroused them. A&#xD;
man came into the barn to feed the cattle, and care&#xD;
for the young animals housed there from the severe&#xD;
weather of the early spring.&#xD;
Chauncey's first impulse was to call to him for&#xD;
help; but a motion which he made, as if for such a&#xD;
purpose, was detected by the vigilant Graham, who&#xD;
instantly placed his hand over the young man s.&#xD;

mouth, and, with a whispered oath, or~lered him to&#xD;
lie still. The man was recognized by David as an&#xD;
acquaintance, named Francis Noble, now in the em-&#xD;
ployment of Mr. Gunn, as a laborer. Indeed, he was&#xD;
on~e of those whom David had invited t ojoin him&#xD;
in the expedition, but for some ieasoas of his own,&#xD;
* he had, declined. He xvas known, however, to be&#xD;
one of the tory party, and it instantly occurred to&#xD;
* David th~at he might be. of assistance to them in&#xD;
* their present circumstances. Accordingly he called&#xD;
6ut from under the hay, where he lay hid,-&#xD;
Halloo, Frank ! Is that you ?"&#xD;
Halloo !" re~p6nded Noble, looking~ round in&#xD;
surprise, but seeing no one. At length" espying&#xD;
Wooster, as he threw the h~.y from him and sat up,&#xD;
he said,&#xD;
"Oh, it is you-is it ?'&#xD;
"Yes," said the latter, "what there is left of me.&#xD;
I 'declare, I was never so tired in my life."&#xD;
By4his time the rest~ of the party were awake,&#xD;
and began to disclose 'themselves. Noble at once&#xD;
comprehended the reason of their presence at the&#xD;
barn, and a few words of mutual introduction and&#xD;
explanation between him ~and the strangers of the&#xD;
party put them all at their ease.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sd then," said Noble, "it was you~ that made&#xD;
that confounded racket in the, night - was it? I&#xD;
couldn't think what stirred up the dogs so. How&#xD;
did you manage to get in here without being eaten&#xD;
up? "'&#xD;
"Uncle Joe came out, and called them off.~ But&#xD;
say, Nol~le, how is it here just now? Anybody&#xD;
round ?"&#xD;
6&#xD;
"No ;' I guess not. Webb's going with me over&#xD;
to the mountain chopping to-day. There's nobody&#xD;
else here but the women folks."&#xD;
"Where's the old fnan himself?"&#xD;
"I don't know.' He was up androff as soon as it&#xD;
was light; in fact, I don't believe he went to bed&#xD;
again after you came. His wife says he had ~to go&#xD;
to town very early this morning, and couldn't stay&#xD;
for breakfast with the rest 'of us."&#xD;
"He wouldn't go to make trouble for us - would&#xD;
he?"&#xD;
"More likely to leep out of 'trouble for' himself,&#xD;
I guess. He wouldn't want to have it known, may&#xD;
be, that he had seen you. But you haven't told&#xD;
me how you made out with your adventure last&#xD;
night." I&#xD;
"No, and we an t going to; at least, not now.&#xD;

&#xD;
Haven't time for long yarns this morning. We&#xD;
have got to think what to do next, and you must&#xD;
help us a little. Can't we leave our bundled here,&#xD;
covered up under the hay, for a while? 'Twon't do&#xD;
for us to be seen with them."&#xD;
"Yes; I s'pose so. 'Tan't likely anybody but&#xD;
me will be coming into the barn to-day. But what&#xD;
are you going to do with yourselves ?"&#xD;
"I'm going to run up home for a few minutes,&#xD;
and see if all is cleax~ there. If' it is, we can stay&#xD;
there for a while, at least, safe enough. I shall be&#xD;
just in time for breakfast; and while I am gone,&#xD;
you must arrange to get something for the rest.&#xD;
We are all as hungry as bears. Aunt Nabby will&#xD;
find them a breakfast, I know, with a4ittle coaxing.&#xD;
Of course Uncl~ Joe told her who we are. I'll be&#xD;
back here before you are through."&#xD;
"Better have the captain go in and speak to her&#xD;
himself. He would have more influence with her&#xD;
than 'I; and besides, I must be off with Webb.&#xD;
He'll 'be along now in a few minutes."&#xD;
"Well, if Captain Graham is willing," replied&#xD;
David; "onl) it vvon't dp for him or the rest to&#xD;
seen by anybody, if it can be helped."&#xD;
* 'Graham, af~er some demurring, consented; and&#xD;
&#xD;
when Noble had finishe~I his morning work in the&#xD;
barnhe accompanied the latter to the house. The&#xD;
dogs still showed some disposition to regard~ the&#xD;
stranger as an intruder, but the reproving voice of&#xD;
Noble silenced them, and they p remittedd him to&#xD;
pass.&#xD;
Mrs. Gunn as engaged in the usual housework&#xD;
of the morning, assisted by a stout serving woman&#xD;
and maid of all work, who was washing' up the&#xD;
breakfast dishes at the sink. Her husband, as&#xD;
David supposed, had informed her who their un-&#xD;
seasonable visitors were, and cautioned her to have&#xD;
as little to do with them as possible. So it was&#xD;
rather an ungracious reception which she accorded&#xD;
to them when Noble introduced Graham~ to her.&#xD;
"We came rather unceremoniously last night,"&#xD;
said the latter, "but preferred quarters in the barn&#xD;
rather than disturb you at that unseasonablehour.'&#xD;
And now' we propose to leave as soon as possible,&#xD;
but need some breakfast before we start. We were&#xD;
up nearly all night, and are very hungry. If you&#xD;
will get us something, we'll be' really obliged to&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"I'm very sorry," she said, "to refuse anybody&#xD;

a meal of victuals; but I lI~pe you will excuse me&#xD;
this morning."&#xD;
"But we'll pay you well for your trouble."&#xD;
"Oh, as to that, I don't care for any pay. But&#xD;
my husband told me who you are, and what you&#xD;
have been doing; and it will be dangerous for us&#xD;
to have you here. The rebels are keeping asharii&#xD;
lookout on us here in Gunntown, and if they could&#xD;
get hold of anything against us, it 'would cost us&#xD;
dear."&#xD;
"Bt~t we can't live without eating, you know.&#xD;
We'll carry it out to the barn, ~o that you nee~1&#xD;
not see anybody; and we will take care that no-&#xD;
'1&#xD;
body sees us.&#xD;
"I'd r~ither not," said the lady. "You can get&#xD;
breakfast somewhere in the neighborhood, I've no&#xD;
doubt; but Mr. Gunn would not like to have me&#xD;
get it."&#xD;
"Then, madam," he replied, tartly, "there's noth-&#xD;
ing for us to do but to come in and help ourselves.&#xD;
We don't leave these premises till we have had&#xD;
something to eat; so there's no use in n~aking any&#xD;
more fuss about it."&#xD;
"How many are there of you?" she asked.&#xD;
"Six, not countingg Wooster, who ha~ gone to&#xD;
&#xD;
get his breakfast at his father's. Rather seven, I&#xD;
should say; for the youngster we caught last night&#xD;
will want something to eat, I suppose.~~&#xD;
"Who is that?" she inquired.&#xD;
"His name is Judd, I believe. We met him&#xD;
half a mile or so below here, in the street, and con-&#xD;
cluded it would be safest for us to bring him along&#xD;
with us."&#xD;
"I hope you don't intend him any harm," she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Oh, no ; at least we have nothing against him,&#xD;
except that he happened to meet us as he did.&#xD;
But excuse me for saying that we haven't time for&#xD;
anything but breakfast now. Most of oirlr party&#xD;
are your own acquaintances, living somewhere in&#xD;
this neighborhood, and you can't run any risk in&#xD;
giving us a little something to eat."&#xD;
Then, throwing a couple of silver dollars upon&#xD;
the table, he added,&#xD;
"There! that will pay you for your trouble, and&#xD;
the risk too."&#xD;
It was not easy to resist persuasions so enforced,&#xD;
for these ringing coins were anything bkit plentiful&#xD;
in those ti m~s ; so the good woman yielded at&#xD;

slices of ham, with a gar~is~ing of eggs and a huge&#xD;
rye loaf, were soon ready. Noble seized the big&#xD;
cider pitcher, and went ihto the cellar, whence he&#xD;
presently returned with it full; and the two, taking&#xD;
the food n~w prepared, bore it to the barb, where&#xD;
S&#xD;
the others were waiting with what patience their&#xD;
sharpened appetites permitted. Ntble forthwith&#xD;
returned to the house, and Mr. Webb just then&#xD;
arriving, he called the dogs ~o accompany them,&#xD;
and the two set off together to the woods, with&#xD;
their axes, ~ot their day's work.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
LONGMEADOW BROOK.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE breakfast in the barn was 'dispatched&#xD;
speedily and in silence'; abd then, Gra-&#xD;
ham, drawing his pipe from ~his pocket,&#xD;
and lighting it by ~ flash 'from his pistol, seated him-&#xD;
self on an upturned half bushel measure, and called&#xD;
his men to order ~for consultation. As to their&#xD;
own movements, ~hey must wait, of course, for''&#xD;
David's return~ before they could decide~ Mean-'&#xD;
wl~iIe another inquiry, of no less importance, was,&#xD;
what should be done' with their captive? They&#xD;
could not talk of this' very freely in his presence;&#xD;
so one. of their number was directed to take him&#xD;
aside to one of the stables, where he would be out&#xD;
of hearing.&#xD;
Their meeting with him was the one misfortune I&#xD;
which threatened to upset all their skillfully devised&#xD;
"7&#xD;

plans. They had so arrangedd their proceedings'&#xD;
4he night before, that ti~i e alarm awakened by the&#xD;
robbery should be turned in an entirely different&#xD;
direction, and believed that nobody would think of&#xD;
looking for the perpetrators of it in this out-of-the-&#xD;
w~y region. Three, of the party belonged here;&#xD;
two others had relations in the vic~initv; so that~&#xD;
their \presence would occasion no suspicion. Gra-&#xD;
ham and Martin might easily be concealed, it was&#xD;
thought, till a convenient opportunity should be&#xD;
afforded for getting 4way. But now that they had&#xD;
- stumbled upon Chauncey, all this xvent for naught.&#xD;
If he was released, he would disclose their secret,&#xD;
and concealment would be impossible. If he was&#xD;
not released, his disappearance itself would create&#xD;
an alarm, in that very neighborhood, which would&#xD;
surely lead to a discovery.&#xD;
The consultation was earnest, but brief. The&#xD;
exigencies of the situation were too obvious to need&#xD;
long consideration. It was very clear that they could&#xD;
nOt stay in Gunntown, and equally clear that they&#xD;
must not release their prisoner. But what should&#xD;
they do withhim? lie might be kept in confine-,&#xD;
ment at Mr. 'Wooster's, or some other' of the tory&#xD;
houses, till they could get away; but this would be'&#xD;
&#xD;
at the utmost peril of their friends, or whoever&#xD;
should be engaged in it. They might take him&#xD;
along' with them; but he would encumber their&#xD;
flight, and expose them every moment to discovery.&#xD;
To every suoa'estio      could think of, there,'&#xD;
were insuperable objections.&#xD;
At last Graham, waxing impatient, exclaimed,&#xD;
xx~ith an~ oath, -&#xD;
"What a fuss you make' about the boy! I say;&#xD;
now, there's only one thing to be done, and if' it&#xD;
an't pleasant, you have got to come to it. We&#xD;
vizist put /~im out of tkc way, and then run for it.&#xD;
'Dead, men tell no tales,' you know. In time of&#xD;
war, it's kill or be killed; and when it comes to&#xD;
that, I an't long in choosing which. Probably it is&#xD;
something worse than that now. It is kill or -&#xD;
Newgate, or some such 'cursed nonsense as that."&#xD;
The rest of the party at first stood aghast at this&#xD;
speech. Bad as they were, they were not yet pre-&#xD;
pared for downright murder. And yet it was&#xD;
easier to object than it was to find any other way&#xD;
out of the difficulty. Graham was resolute, and,&#xD;
as he was wont to be when opposed, overbearing.&#xD;
They needn't soil their lily hands, 'he said; he&#xD;
would do the job himself. Let them show~ him a&#xD;

place where the body might be safely disposed of,&#xD;
and he would soon relieve them of .the burden.&#xD;
He only wished he could get rid of the whole&#xD;
Yankee race as easily.&#xD;
At that time the low grounds adjacent to Mr.&#xD;
Gunn's house, now a beautiful meadow, were cov-&#xD;
ered with a. thicket of alders and swamp vwillows.&#xD;
Through this ran the Longmneadow Brook, a good-&#xD;
sized mill-stream, then, under the melting of the:&#xD;
snows and c pious March rains, flowing. in full&#xD;
banks, and -wth a swift and strong current. In&#xD;
this thicket a deed of crime like that. suggested&#xD;
might be committed without molestation, and any&#xD;
one of the numerous eddies of the brook would&#xD;
afford a place where a body might be sunk out of&#xD;
sight. After .a little more demurring from some&#xD;
of the party, it was concluded to take the lad&#xD;
thither.&#xD;
The distance from the barn to the swamp was&#xD;
only a few rods, down a lane, between two stone&#xD;
walls, which served the cattle as a path to water.&#xD;
Calling Chauncey and his keeper from the stable,&#xD;
the men set off down the lane, after, reconnoitering&#xD;
the house and road, to ascertain that .nobody was&#xD;
in sight. TIhe young man -perceived, from the&#xD;

manner of his .captors, that -something final had&#xD;
been-decided on as to his fate, and began to beg&#xD;
for a release. He promised most solemnly that lie&#xD;
would keep his meeting with them a secret, but 'it:&#xD;
was without avail. Little was said to him in reply,&#xD;
.and the whole party only hurried forward as fast&#xD;
as possible.&#xD;
An open spot was found among the bushes, near&#xD;
where the stream made a deep pool of dark water,&#xD;
flecked with foam from the rapids above. Chaun-&#xD;
cey was dragged to the brink, and bidden to fall&#xD;
upon his knees, while Graham, with a loaded&#xD;
musket, withdrew a short distance from him.&#xD;
"Young man," he said, in a low,~ but determined&#xD;
voice, "you must prepare to die ! WSAe are very&#xD;
sorry it has come to this, -sorry that we. met you&#xD;
at all, -but it can't be helped now. It's hard,-I&#xD;
admit ; but you are young, and haven't so much to&#xD;
answer for as some- that are older, and that' sin&#xD;
your favor. So you must make the best of it, and&#xD;
submit. ,Say your prayers as quick as you can.&#xD;

his forebodings had been, he had not dreamed of&#xD;
this, and the sudden shock almost deprived him&#xD;
of reason as well as, speech. Rallying again in a&#xD;
moment, he instinctively fe on his knees to beg&#xD;
for his life. He besought them to have pity upon&#xD;
him. ~-Ie~ protested[ that he had no wish to injure&#xD;
them, and repeated the most solemn promises, that&#xD;
if they would release him, he would never reveal&#xD;
their presence in the neighborhood to any human&#xD;
being. He turned to the young men with whom&#xD;
he had been acquainted, and whom he had met at&#xD;
huskings and merry-makings, a~d entreated them&#xD;
to save him. All seemed in vain. Graham stood&#xD;
im n~ lovable, with his watch held forth in his open&#xD;
hanA, counting off the minutes as they passed.&#xD;
"Threes four, five!"&#xD;
"God in heaven !"' cried the boy, frantically,&#xD;
"help me! Oh, mother, motl~er ! ".~ for in the&#xD;
hour of mortal anguish, the heart leaps uncon-&#xD;
sciously to hide itset~ ~upon the bosom which was'&#xD;
so oft a safe place from infancy's fears "save&#xD;
me! save your boy!"&#xD;
"Seven, eight!" said Graham, in unaltered tones.&#xD;
The agonizing c~y of the lad sank into a low,&#xD;
inarticulate moan of despair. The robbers stood&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
like statues' in silence, but with faces which re-&#xD;
vealea some misgivings within. It must have been&#xD;
a hard heart indeed that could resist such plead-&#xD;
ings of innocence and helplessness unmoved.&#xD;
"Nine, ten ! time's up !" exclaimed the captain,&#xD;
returning the watch to his pocket) and raising the&#xD;
musket to his shoulder.&#xD;
At that instant Henry Wooster sprang forward,&#xD;
aiict ci~yped his hand- over the muzzle.&#xD;
"No, captain,'~ said. he, "don't fire; it's too bad!"&#xD;
"Get out of the way!" thundered the ruffian,&#xD;
"or I'll blow your hand off!"&#xD;
Almost at the ~same moment both Cady and&#xD;
$cott interposed, rushing in between him and&#xD;
Chauncey. ~Wooster seized the gun, and raised&#xD;
the muzzle into the air. He was; though slender,&#xD;
~ powerful young man, and once roused to his full&#xD;
energy, was not to be trifled with. With an oath&#xD;
that outdid for the 'moment the captain's own, he&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"You shan't kill him ! He hasn't done us any&#xD;
harm, and it's a mean, cowardly trick to shoot an&#xD;
unarmed boy like him, just to save your precious&#xD;
carcass. You've gdt to shoot me first!"&#xD;

and they planted themselves firmly as a screen&#xD;
before the kneeling figure of \t he youth.&#xD;
Graham was pale with rake. I-fe vented his&#xD;
anger in the most passionate urses. But he saw&#xD;
that he must desist from his purpose, at least for&#xD;
that time. Great as was his influence over his&#xD;
men ordinarily, there was a point, beyond which&#xD;
they would not go. That point was reached, and&#xD;
he was obliged sulkily to acquiesce.&#xD;
Before the altercation had subsided, a rustling&#xD;
wasTheard in the thicket near by, and suddenly&#xD;
David Wooster sprang into the open space among&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Are you crazy, men?" he shouted, in a hoarse&#xD;
whisper. "I heard you swearing clear up to the&#xD;
barn, and in that way found out where you were.&#xD;
If you are going to wrangle) like this, we shall have&#xD;
all the rebels in Waterbury down upon us before&#xD;
night. What's the row, any way?"&#xD;
* "Oh, David!" cried the respite boy, "save me!&#xD;
Don't let them shoot me&#xD;
"Shoot you? Of course he won't. I sat, Cap-&#xD;
tam, Judd shan't be hurt. He's an old .~ chooV.&#xD;
fellow and, neighbor of mine, and I'll stand by him&#xD;
i he is a rebel."&#xD;

"Come, fellows," he added; "I've seen the old&#xD;
folks, and the coast is clear. W~e dan stay there&#xD;
safety till night, and then we'll see what'~ to be&#xD;
done. But don't go back to the karn now. Keep&#xD;
along here in the swamp, out of sight, till you get&#xD;
near the house, and then mind your chance, and&#xD;
yoti will get hi without being seen. Our things&#xD;
will be safe where they are for a while, and father&#xD;
will send a team, by and by, to take them home."&#xD;
So saying, he led the way, by paths with which&#xD;
he was familiar, through the swamp and the adja-&#xD;
cent fields, till they all arrived safely at Mr. Woos-&#xD;
ter's. Henry and David kept Chauncey near to&#xD;
them, not only to prevent his escape, but to secure&#xD;
him from harm by Graham, who ffmttered * impreca-&#xD;
tions upon his soul, if he was going to be foiled by&#xD;
a set of ~vhite-livered cowards like them.&#xD;

*A~ PURSUIT FROM BETTIANY.&#xD;
*  A&#xD;
9    EARILYA the leaden     hours . of night&#xD;
dragged themselVes onward, while Mrs.&#xD;
J~ Dayton and her frightened childm~en sit,&#xD;
where the robbers had left tli~em, waiting for the&#xD;
dawn. By the help of her servants, she had suc-&#xD;
ceeded in extricating herself from the strips of sheet-&#xD;
ing with which they had bound her,~but she could&#xD;
do no h ing more. Neither commands nor entrea-&#xD;
ties x~ uld have imiduced the blacks to venture out in&#xD;
the ni ht to arouse the neighbors; and Mrs. Dayton&#xD;
overcome with prost ation from excitement,&#xD;
fovu~d herself unequal to the exertion. Besides, she&#xD;
shuddered at the' fearftil thr ats'of vengeance which&#xD;
'had been heaped on her if she attempted to give&#xD;
the alarm before morning'; so she composed her...&#xD;
self as well as 'she could~ and wished for the ~1ay.&#xD;
126&#xD;
&#xD;
At ;Th~t a faint blush begaii to spread over the&#xD;
east, and the noisy fowls, calling to each* other&#xD;
from the neighboring barns, announced the coming&#xD;
of the morning. Slow indeed is her approach in&#xD;
circumstances like these. Does she linger QII her&#xD;
way; and w~ar t~e blush of shame when she ap-&#xD;
pears, as if conscious of the A evil deeds that have&#xD;
b~en donein her absence, but which s~he is now to&#xD;
meet with oben face?&#xD;
With trembling hand Mrs. Dayton drew aside&#xD;
the window curtains, and beheld the smoke from&#xD;
Dr. Hooker's mansi6n i~hooting up like a slender&#xD;
pillar in the keen March air. A few minPtes later&#xD;
the doctor himself appearect on the w~y to his&#xD;
~.t able as if preparing to set forth on a professional&#xD;
With&#xD;
isit.      difficulty~the window was raised, and&#xD;
the united voices of the lady and her servants&#xD;
shouted to him for help. So unwanted a sound in&#xD;
the still morning atmosphere penetrated far, and&#xD;
the doctor hastened to ascertain its meaning.&#xD;
Arriving at the unfo~5tunate dwelling, a few words.&#xD;
of explanation, in~connectio~ v(~ith the broken win-&#xD;
dow, sufficed to reveal the cause of the alarm.&#xD;
"Good heavens!" he exclai ed ; "and all this&#xD;
within sight and hearing of' ~i)\ all! I should ~say&#xD;

&#xD;
that was a smart piece of bu~iness. However, it's&#xD;
~no more than I expected. I've told neighbor Day-,&#xD;
ton fifty times, that it~ was not safe to have ~o much&#xD;
money ~nd other valuables in his l~ouse. There~&#xD;
are ever so many stories that wouldn't scruple a&#xD;
moment to engage in such a job as this."&#xD;
"I know it," replied Mrs. Dayton; "and I have&#xD;
worried over it a great deal. But Mr. Dayton&#xD;
always said there were enough here to protect the&#xD;
house; an~ indeed our ~men have been here till&#xD;
yesterday, ,~ when they xMent ~away. My husband,&#xD;
too, had tq go to Boston,~and leave us alone -just&#xD;
for once, he said."&#xD;
"Well, I've no doubt the villains found' it out,&#xD;
and seized the opportunity. It's very probable&#xD;
that somebody has been watching a good while for&#xD;
just such a chance as this. But I must not stay&#xD;
here gabbling. Something's got to be done, and&#xD;
right away too. They have had time enough to&#xD;
get clear off, I'm afraid; a1read~. Do you know&#xD;
whether the rascals had. horses ?"&#xD;
"I did not hear of any; but I was in such a&#xD;
state of excitement that may be I shouldn't if they&#xD;
had."&#xD;
"Well, compose yourself as weN as you 'can, and&#xD;
&#xD;
I'll have the alarm given at once. No time to lose.&#xD;
K.     St~pid.that I was not to hear the noise.&#xD;
And the doctor hastened home, muttering at his&#xD;
own obtuseness in allowing such a crime as this to&#xD;
be perpetrated, so near them, and not to know it.&#xD;
Arriving at his house, he sent Scipio, his black&#xD;
man, to ring the meeting-house bell. The maraud-&#xD;
ing expedition of General Tryon and his British&#xD;
troops, the summer before, at New Haven and&#xD;
along the Sound, had greatly alarmed the coast&#xD;
towns, and in their apprehension that their ravages&#xD;
might be renewed, they had agreed that the ring-&#xD;
ing of the bell, except in the usual way for public&#xD;
worship and funerals, should be 'the signal of&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
"Ring it hard, Scip;" cried the doctor; "make&#xD;
it fly lively!"&#xD;
After relating briefly to his family the events of&#xD;
the night, he next hastened across the Green to the&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Hawley's.&#xD;
That gentleman had already risen, and at the&#xD;
first stroke of the bell, had come to the door to&#xD;
as~ertaiu the cause of the alarm. He was just in&#xD;
time to receive the greeting of Dr. Hooker, who&#xD;
cried, as he approached the door, -&#xD;

"A pretty piece of business this, Parson Flaw-&#xD;
ley done right here under our noses, and we so&#xD;
stupid as hot to h~~'~a sound!"&#xD;
Why, what has happened, ~loctor?" inquired&#xD;
the latter.&#xD;
In a fe~ words the physician stated in what&#xD;
condition .he had found Mrs. Dayton. and her fain-&#xD;
ill, and repeated her account of the robbery during&#xD;
the night. Mr. Hawley agreed with him in the&#xD;
opinion 4hat this as the work of the stories, and&#xD;
thought it likely it as some retaliatory expedition&#xD;
from Long Island, *rom whence it wa~ well known&#xD;
Dayton had broug t his goods.&#xD;
"They that take the sword shall perish by the&#xD;
sword," said the good man. "Captain Dayton&#xD;
ought not to expect that on~ who has been so&#xD;
active and successful in privateering as he. could&#xD;
escape retaliation, although so far from the coast.&#xD;
It is a very fortunate thing for him that he wa~&#xD;
not at home, for he could not alone have resisted&#xD;
a half dozen of armed ruffians, and would, in all&#xD;
probability, have been miirdered in his own house."&#xD;
"No doubt of it," replied the doctor. "If the&#xD;
r~ascalshad caught him, he xx~ould never have gone&#xD;
privateering again, you may be sure. However,&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
it's a pity he is not here now. 1-k knows all the&#xD;
haunts pf the cow-boys and stories on the island,&#xD;
and very likely could tell just who the robbers&#xD;
were, and where to find them."&#xD;
Meanwhile th~ lively peal of the bell, under the&#xD;
vigorous demonstrations of old Scipio, sent its sharp,&#xD;
summons through the clear March morning; and&#xD;
it was not long before the alarmed townsmen be-&#xD;
gan to appear. *Some brought muskets with them;&#xD;
a few, from the more distant dwellings, came. on&#xD;
horseback. All were in a state of the greatest&#xD;
excitement, inquiring what had happened.&#xD;
The doctor, having snatched a morsel of break-&#xD;
fast, returned to the church door, and explained to&#xD;
the people, as they assembled, the reason of the&#xD;
alarm. With one voice, they concurred in the sus-&#xD;
picions he had already expressed as to the perpe~&#xD;
traitors of the outrage.&#xD;
"It is;the work of the. cursed stories " cried one.&#xD;
We nmjst hang every mother's son' of them."&#xD;
"Ay,"~ said another ; " and I'll be one to do it.&#xD;
But we i4ave got to catch them first, and that may&#xD;
not be s~ easy. They have had time to get half&#xD;
way to the island already."'&#xD;
".1 doh't know about that," was the reply. "If&#xD;

&#xD;
they have carried off Captain Dayton's goods, they&#xD;
have got some heavy bundles to lug, .and if we are&#xD;
smart, we can overtake them yet.&#xD;
While all agreed, however, that the robbery was&#xD;
the work of the stories, there was not altogether the&#xD;
same unanimity of feeling as to the character of&#xD;
the transaction.&#xD;
Bethany, like some of the adjacent towns, had a&#xD;
large sprinkling df stories among its inhabitants;&#xD;
and these, as well as the whigs, responded to the&#xD;
call of the bell, so far at least as to ascertain what&#xD;
was going on. When they learned what had t4ken&#xD;
place, they were far from expressing the indig-&#xD;
nation which was felt by tho~e of the opposite&#xD;
party. 'They were sorry, indeed, to have Mrs. Day-&#xD;
ton and her children disturbed, but had no regrets&#xD;
for Dayton himself&#xD;
~b'One of the most bitter of these stories was an old&#xD;
fellow named Lines. He was profane and vulgar,&#xD;
and had an impediment in his speech, which, when&#xD;
he was excited by drink or passion, often occa-&#xD;
sioned very ludicrous scenes. He came up to the&#xD;
Green mounted on an old mare, never of the most&#xD;
amiable temper, 'but this morning particularly&#xD;
ruffled at 'being taken from her snug stable, and&#xD;

.compelled to face the cutting ~March wind. Wh~n&#xD;
he learned that Captain Dayton's Ipuse had been&#xD;
broken into and robbed, 'he declared that he was&#xD;
glad of it.&#xD;
"S-s-sarved him right," he said, "the old p-pirate!&#xD;
G-g-guess he'll know how g-good it seems t'other&#xD;
p-peo-people to have their houses p-p-plundered."&#xD;
"You think so - do you, Uncle Luke?" said&#xD;
young Sam Perkins, riding up behind him, and touch-&#xD;
ing the old mare with his whip under the flank.&#xD;
The vicious beast, laying her ears back, responded&#xD;
with a kick which tossed her rider forward upon&#xD;
her neck. Grasping instinctively at the~ mane, to&#xD;
save himself from falling, he lost his hold of the&#xD;
bridle, at the same time crying,&#xD;
"Wh-wh-whoa!"&#xD;
Sam, seeing Line s's plight, brought 'his whip&#xD;
again with a sharp cu.t across the hai~nches of the&#xD;
irate animal. ' This insult w~s more than she could&#xD;
bear. Wheeling herself in' the direction of home,&#xD;
she started off at full gallop, her rider stuttering&#xD;
curses upon the' mare and the rebels, and crying,&#xD;
"Whoa! wh-whoa!" But curses and commands&#xD;
were alike unavailing, and the old man disappeared&#xD;
over the hill, clinging to the' neck of his 'beast,&#xD;

while the rest of the company -shouted after&#xD;
him,&#xD;
" Go it, you old tory ; three to 'one you'll win&#xD;

When the laughter at Uncle Luke's discomfiture&#xD;
had subsd, the townsmen began to, consult la&#xD;
good earnest as to the measures they should adopt&#xD;
for overtaking and capturing the robbers.&#xD;
Meanwhile a portion of the men, had been exam&#xD;
ining the premises to see what clew to the robbers,&#xD;
if any, might be found. Some traces of their foot&#xD;
-steps Were detected in th 'snow under the broken&#xD;
window, but- they had been mostly obliterated byj&#xD;
the winid, nor could they e tracked away from the&#xD;
house. .No signs of hor es could be discovered,&#xD;
and it was inferred that they probably had none,&#xD;
which was a. favorable circumstance, giving hope&#xD;
that the pursuit wold not be fruitless.&#xD;
On -inquiring further of the familyl, ,little addi-&#xD;
tional could, be learned beyond what Dr. Hooker&#xD;
.had already stated. Mrs. Dayton described the&#xD;
appearance of the burglars, who seemed to her to&#xD;
be six or eight in number, mostly young men.&#xD;
One of them they called " Captain," and another,&#xD;
who had been set with his musket to guard Mrs.&#xD;

Dayton, " Dave."  The sacks they used for bun-&#xD;
dling up the goods were mentioned, and the goods&#xD;
themselves,.so far as she could recollect them, --at&#xD;
least those which she -knew they had had. in the&#xD;
house. From the sound of their voices and 'steps&#xD;
when they left, sh~e concluded' that they had gone&#xD;
off westward toward Chuse-town.&#xD;
After gathering all the information possible, a&#xD;
consultation was had as to the course to be taken&#xD;
in pursuit. On this point' opinions were divided.&#xD;
Some believed that the plunderers had started for&#xD;
Derby, where it was known many tories lived,&#xD;
an'd from which frequent communication was held&#xD;
with the island. Others thought it more likely&#xD;
that they had gone to, New Haven, or possibly&#xD;
West Haven, the point where the British troops&#xD;
had landed the sumrner before, and which would be&#xD;
several miles nearer Long Island than any other&#xD;
.within their reach,&#xD;
By this time, the bell having continued its noisy&#xD;
clangor, a large number -were~ assembled, and it&#xD;
wa~s decided to divide into several parties. A por-&#xD;
tion, who had horses, should take the road through&#xD;
.Amity parish to New Haven ; others should start&#xD;
for Derby. Others still should call upon certain&#xD;

&#xD;
tory families in Bethany itself, and see if something&#xD;
could not be learned that would afford a clew to the&#xD;
perpetrators of the outrage It w~is agreed also&#xD;
that if these were found, i~2tice should be given by&#xD;
again ringing the bell, ending with half a dozen&#xD;
separate strokes, as if tolling on a Sabbath morning.&#xD;
The pursuit, thus organized, began with vigor.:&#xD;
The p~art~destined for New Haven rode rapidly&#xD;
.)forward, making inquiries of all whom they met,&#xD;
'~but of course learned nothing of the robbers. They&#xD;
continued their journey, however, toward the city,&#xD;
~1eeming it important, if these had not already&#xD;
reached tl~ere, that such information should be&#xD;
given of the affair as should leac! to their arrest if&#xD;
they can~e. But though they failed in the imme-&#xD;
diate object in view, they succeeded in another&#xD;
scarcely less important, viz., in meeting Captain&#xD;
Dayton himself, and informing him of what had&#xD;
taken place in his absence.&#xD;
Dayton had started from Boston for home on&#xD;
Monday morning, and reached New Haven on the&#xD;
evening of Tuesday. At that time the only means&#xD;
of travel between the two places were on foot or&#xD;
on horseback. The distance wa~~ about one hun~&#xD;
dred and twenty-five miles, constituting two hard&#xD;
&#xD;
days' ride. Such a thing as a regular coach for&#xD;
passengers was hardly knownin this country. The&#xD;
first public conveyance .of the kind, established at&#xD;
Boston, was in 1763, called the" Portsmouth Flying&#xD;
Stage-coach," running once a week, each way, be-&#xD;
tween Boston and Portsmouth. It was not till&#xD;
after the Revolution that so serious an undertaking&#xD;
was ventured upon as to s~t up a line between&#xD;
Boston and New York. Having rested in New&#xD;
Haven on Tuesday night, Dayton had now, on&#xD;
Wednesday morning, started for Bethany, and had&#xD;
gone L~it a mile or two, when' 'he was met by the&#xD;
party of pursuers from that place.&#xD;
On receiving information of the ,' catastrophe&#xD;
which had happened to his house and family, Day- j~'&#xD;
4&#xD;
ton at once 'confirmed the general belief' that the  '~&#xD;
perpetra~ors of it were from Long Island, and&#xD;
added his opinioti 'that they had come ~by the way&#xD;
of Derby, whither also they had probably returned.&#xD;
So strong was his conviction 'of this' fact, ~that&#xD;
the pursuers did not think it worth while to ~go&#xD;
further toward New Haven, but returned with&#xD;
him to ]3ethany.&#xD;
The search in the direction of Derby, though&#xD;
equally unsuccessful in capturing' the robbers, pro-&#xD;

<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8224-00000071"/>&#xD;
138          CHAUNCEY JUDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
cured, nevertheless, important information concern-&#xD;
ing them. It was soon made apparent that they&#xD;
had come from thence. In shelliered places of the&#xD;
road, the footsteps of several men were discernible&#xD;
in the snow. At one house, where they stopped to&#xD;
ii~iquire, it was stated that such a company as the&#xD;
robbers were supposect to be, had been seen passing&#xD;
in the night by a watcher in charge of a sick room.&#xD;
It was not, however, till they reached Whitternore' s&#xD;
tavern, in Chuse-town, that they got any definite&#xD;
clew to the men themselves. The landlord recalled&#xD;
the fact that two strangers had lodged at his house&#xD;
on the Saturday night previous, and that a consid-&#xD;
erable number of young men, among whom were&#xD;
Doolittle and the Woosters, were gathered in the,&#xD;
bar-room. He observed also that they were en-&#xD;
gaged in a conversation about Captain Dayton and&#xD;
his ~privateering expeditions, in which considerable&#xD;
warriith of feeling was manifested, the strangers&#xD;
expressing admiration of Dayton's exploits, and the&#xD;
others mostly condemning and denouncing them.&#xD;
He said, however, that he had retired early that&#xD;
evening, feeling somexvhat unwell, leaving Wooding&#xD;
in charge of the bar-room, and knew nothing more&#xD;
of what happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
?UK~Ui1~ FROM BETHANY.        139&#xD;
Wooing was next questioned, and very soon&#xD;
betrayed that he knew more of the affair than he&#xD;
was willing to acknowledge. He said that the&#xD;
two strangers had left on Sunday morning, and he&#xD;
had not seen them since; and that the ydung men&#xD;
who' were 'conversing with them in the bar-room&#xD;
went away, as usual, at a somewhat late hour.&#xD;
While this questioning was going on, two of the&#xD;
pursuers, learning where Wooding lived, went to&#xD;
hi~ house, and soon obtained evidence of the falsity&#xD;
of his story, the very strangers whom he professed&#xD;
to know nothing about having, as his wife con-&#xD;
fessed, lodged with them for two nights in succes-&#xD;
sion. Further inquiries were also made at Mr.&#xD;
Wooster's, and at the place where Doolittle worked,&#xD;
neither of whom had been at home the past night.&#xD;
~Sus~iciQns now q~ilckly ripened into conviction&#xD;
that the culprits, or a part of them, had been ascer-&#xD;
tained. Wooing was arrested and put under&#xD;
keepei~s; then, arranging that a sharp lookout&#xD;
should be kept at the tavern and the vicinity, the&#xD;
party g~il1oped back to Bethany to report th~ result.&#xD;
Captain Dayton at once concurred in the belief&#xD;
that a sure clew had been obtained to the plun-&#xD;
derers of his house, And the mention of the Woos-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8224-00000072"/>&#xD;
ters suggested the .p robable direction of their&#xD;
flight. It was well known that several tory famir&#xD;
lies of that name lived in Gunntown. and nothing&#xD;
waste more probable than that the robbers, should&#xD;
have, gone thither with their booty. He immedi-'&#xD;
ately drew up a.n advertisement, narrating the crime&#xD;
which had been committed, naming the persons&#xD;
suspected, and offering the large reward of five&#xD;
thousand dollars for such information as would&#xD;
lead to the conviction of the plunderers and the&#xD;
recovery off the property.&#xD;
It was now a little past noon, and a fresh party&#xD;
of men, well mounted, set forth on the road to the r&#xD;
~uspected neighbof~hoofd. Dayton declared himself&#xD;
too much exhausted with his jou ney from Bostont&#xD;
to acco 'pany them, but promi~ ed to come ,the&#xD;
next day if they did, not succe d in their .quest&#xD;
sooner.&#xD;
About 'three miles north from Bethany Ce nte r&#xD;
was a tavern kept by Mr. Perkins, who, as we have&#xD;
before related, had on a summer or two before&#xD;
brouglit horme his young wife, Rosanna' Judd,&#xD;
Chauncey's eldest'sister. The news that Chauncey&#xD;
was missing, however, had not as yet reached him.&#xD;
Stopping here for, a momerit, they received a new&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
and strong confirmation of their belief .that they&#xD;
were now- on the right frack. Some children on&#xD;
their way to school that morning had picked up by&#xD;
the roadside a small marine spy-glass, which they&#xD;
had brought into Mr. Perkins' as a curiosity. On&#xD;
examination, this was found to h ve 'tle name "E.&#xD;
Dayton, Brookhaven, L. I.," engraved upon it, which&#xD;
at once identified it as a part 'of the propertfstolern&#xD;
the 'preceding night.&#xD;
Under the fresh impulse afforded by this discov-&#xD;
ery the pursuers rode forward at a rapid pace and&#xD;
in less than an hour .reached the bridge in, Judd's&#xD;
Meadow. Here they first heard that Chauncey was,&#xD;
missing, a messenger being'met who had been dis-&#xD;
patched to Bethany to, inquire for him, under the&#xD;
supposition that he had for -some reason gone&#xD;
thither to his' sister's. This intelligence at first&#xD;
awakened a 'suspicion that Chauncey himself might&#xD;

been heard then of what are how so much talked&#xD;
of as "the rights of labor." A day's work was no&#xD;
mere eight h ours, but the work of a. whole day,&#xD;
from dawn to dark, or as late as men could see to&#xD;
work. Except in the long days of summer, break-&#xD;
~fast and "chores" must all be completed before&#xD;
* sunrise.&#xD;
It 'was, then, with a slight tone of displeasure&#xD;
that Mrd Judd repeated his call to Chauncey, on&#xD;
that Wednesday morning, that it was time to get&#xD;
up. Like the other boys, he had his share of the&#xD;
morning work to do, and he ought to be about it.&#xD;
No response, however, was made to the call, and&#xD;
the father at last, in some misgivings of heart at&#xD;
small surprise that he found Chauncey's bed not&#xD;
the unusual occurrence, ascended the attic stairs&#xD;
to inquire the cause of. the delay. It was with no&#xD;
only empty, but showing clearly that it had. not&#xD;
been occupied during the night.&#xD;
Inquiries were at once made of the other chil-&#xD;
dren if any of them knew where their brother was,&#xD;
bt~t the answer from them all was in the negative.&#xD;
*    The absence was unusual and unaccountable, for&#xD;
the young man had always been exemplary in his&#xD;
habits, and was the last one 'that would be 'expected&#xD;

to stay away from his home over night without&#xD;
lettingL his parents know of it beforehand. Still&#xD;
there was nothing very alarming 'in it. Several&#xD;
families of relatives were living near I~y, and it was&#xD;
~suggested that he might have been at one of these,&#xD;
and for~ some unexplained reason have been de-&#xD;
tained till morning. So the family sat down to&#xD;
breakfast with the impression that he could not be&#xD;
far away~ and the expectation that he would very&#xD;
soon make his appearance.&#xD;
But th&amp;amp; breakfast was dispatched, the devotions&#xD;
ended, and the absentee did not return. The&#xD;
q~iestion at length grew to be a serious one, 'what&#xD;
had become of Chauncey. A young man could&#xD;
not as easily go from, his home and come again&#xD;
'then as now. No railway train waited to carry&#xD;
hifti a hundred miles and return before night.&#xD;
Maternal solicitude, ever ready to take alarm, be-&#xD;
gan to apprehend some evil. It was the time of&#xD;
war, and the country was full of stragglers, pre-&#xD;
tending to be going to or coming from the army,&#xD;
begging cider, and sleeping in barns. The stories&#xD;
were all the while plotting mischief, and nobody&#xD;

Mr. Judd's nearest neighbor was~, his brother-in-.&#xD;

Hotchkiss had been a lieutenant in the company&#xD;

is recorded that, at his death ir~ 1807, his descend-&#xD;
ants already amounted to dne hundred and five&#xD;
grandchildren, one hundred &amp;amp;rid fifty-five great~&#xD;
grandchildren, and four of the fifthh generation.&#xD;
Two of these seven daughters were Mabel and&#xD;
PhebQ Hotchkiss, then young girls of sixteen and&#xD;
fifteen respectively. These were often at the house&#xD;
of their elder sister, Mrs. Williams, who had a son,&#xD;
Reuben Williams, Jr., of nearly the same age.&#xD;
These, with the members of 'the Judd family, con-&#xD;
stituted a large circle of young people, ~who, 'from&#xD;
their nearness of age and relationship; were united&#xD;
by ties of more than ordinary attachment.&#xD;
It was known, of course, that Chauncey had*&#xD;
been present at the quilting party the preceding&#xD;
evening; and on sending to Mr. Williams', it was&#xD;
ascertained that, at the close of it, he had gone&#xD;

The mystery deepened. The road between&#xD;
Webb's and Judd's was retraced, and the foot-&#xD;
path thi4ugh the wood explored. Here his tracks&#xD;
were visible in the ~snow, but they disappeared&#xD;
when the road was reached, being obliterated by&#xD;
the wind, and the passage of oth~r persons and&#xD;
A      teams. Inquiries were made at all the neighbor-&#xD;
ing dwellings, but he had not been at any of these.&#xD;
Suspense grew into alarm; the mystery became a&#xD;
secret of ominous portent. Had he been waylaid&#xD;
and iknurdered? But for what cause, and what had&#xD;
been ~done with the body? Had he been carried&#xD;
off? But by whom, and whither ~&#xD;
There is no more appalling cry hat can ring&#xD;
11cr than that of a child&#xD;
through the homes of a viabe&#xD;
lost. That one of the members of the little com-&#xD;
6 unity should suddenly disappear, no one knowing&#xD;
how or why, no one knowing his possible fate,&#xD;
eVery one left to form 'a thousand conjectures, and&#xD;
conjure up inr~imerable forms of evil, has in it&#xD;
something to assail the stoutest heart. Sudden&#xD;
calamity, known and certain, often ~overwhelms;&#xD;
but the, element of suspense, the hardest to bear&#xD;
of all, is then withheld. When such a cry is heard,&#xD;
therefore, every body is aroused. The alarm spreads&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
from house to house, till, in an incredibly short&#xD;
time, it has reached the most remote habitation.&#xD;
Every one feels called to hasten to the search for&#xD;
the missing one, or to manifest his sympathies with&#xD;
the bereaved family. And when the lost one is&#xD;
found, there is joy over his return more than over&#xD;
all those who " went not astray.~~&#xD;
Such was the excitement awakened throughout&#xD;
Judd's Meadow by the news .that Chauncey was&#xD;
missing, and, as all appearances indicated, that he&#xD;
had in some 'way been fully dealt with. Inquiries&#xD;
'and suggestions innumerable were made, and par-&#xD;
ties set off in various directions in the hope. of&#xD;
finding some trace of him.&#xD;
The day wore on, and it was already far in the~&#xD;
afternoon when a half dozen horsen~en were seen&#xD;
rapidly galloping, from the direction of the bridge,.&#xD;
toward Mr. Judd's house. Their errand was quick~&#xD;
ly promulgated. A great robbery had been com-&#xD;
mitted in Bethany, and the perpetrators 'of it,&#xD;
ascertained to be. tries, had, it was believed, fled&#xD;
to Gunntown, or its vicinity. Copies of the adver-&#xD;

~large reward for their apprehension, were exhibited.&#xD;

Equally evident was the course to be take~ in&#xD;
pursuit. The presence of the young Wooster~ in&#xD;

.places to which they had undoubtedly gone. The&#xD;
road by Mr. Webb's, ih which Chau ncey probably&#xD;
met thdm, led directl~,r to Gunntown. Doubtless&#xD;
they were concealed at the houses of some of their&#xD;

the reasons stated he had been refused. Notwith-&#xD;
standing' this, he was ready to. congratulate them&#xD;
on their safe return, and impatient to learn the&#xD;
particulars of the affair. Two or three remained a&#xD;
few moments in conversation with him, while the&#xD;
remainder, w'ith their captive, passed on with Mr.&#xD;
Wooster to the house.&#xD;

to the rooms ~above by buckets suspended from the&#xD;
ceiling,, and descending through both floors. A&#xD;

gathered. around the huge fireplace with treat sat-&#xD;

though clear in the morning, now began to be&#xD;
overcast with heavy clouds, and the damp, chill&#xD;
atmosphere betokening a heavy stOrm.&#xD;
At David's request, Seeley was dispatched with&#xD;

little used, as a place at once secure and remote'&#xD;

from hearing; and at his suggestion, Chauncey&#xD;
was sent in thither, a stool being given him to sit&#xD;
on, and the big oaken latch of the door fastened on&#xD;
the outside, so ,that it could not be raised by the&#xD;
string fron~ within. It was an admirable place of&#xD;
detention, where, withoi.it being subjected to per-&#xD;
sonal violence, lie could be 'kept with" absolute&#xD;
security.&#xD;
Feeling now free to converse, the story of their&#xD;
expedition, so far as they chose to give it, 'was&#xD;
related to theiii host, and their packs having ar-&#xD;
rived, they were opened to show the booty they&#xD;
had obtained. David, disregarding prudential qon-&#xD;
siderations, ran up stall's with his to show it to his&#xD;
mother. The rich goods - silks, linens, lades, etc.&#xD;
~-' elicited much admiration, and were freely. dis-&#xD;
tributed between Mrs. Wooster a~pd her daughters.&#xD;
There seemed to be no misgiving on their part as~&#xD;
to the mode in which they had been obtained.&#xD;
Dayton, they all said, was a thief himself, 'and if he&#xD;
now lost his goods in the game way he got thdm,&#xD;
it served him right. No doubt he would make up&#xD;
the loss in his next piratical cruise, and more too.&#xD;
It~ w'as now noon, and 'dinner was prepared for&#xD;

out, from the old-fashioned beaufet in the corner ~of&#xD;
the front room, a square bottle of West India run],&#xD;
"good old Jameeky," he assured them, to&#xD;
which all helped themselves liberally, drinking&#xD;
health to his majesty King George and his good&#xD;
cause, and confusion to all whigs, rebels, and trai~~&#xD;
tors, Congress and Washington included. The&#xD;
good cheer of the table, the genial warmth of the&#xD;
fire, and the success thus far attending their expe-&#xD;
dition, combined to elevate their spirits, and make&#xD;
them forget for the moment the critical circum-&#xD;
stances in which they were placed. Mr. Wooster&#xD;
sent an ample plate of food to the young man in&#xD;
confinement, and even added a glass of liquor, but&#xD;
the poor lad's heart w~is too heavy for an appetite,&#xD;
and the refreshment was left untasted.&#xD;
The hour soon passed, and the question returned&#xD;
to them, with renewed force, what they should do&#xD;
next, and especially what disposition they should&#xD;
make of their prisoner. Contrary to all their in-&#xD;
tentions, it was evident that they could not long&#xD;
remain in Gunntown. Chauncey's disappearance&#xD;
would alarm the neighborhood, to say nothing of a&#xD;
pursuit from Bethany. Again and again did they&#xD;
curse their luck. in meeting him that morning, and&#xD;
&#xD;
their still greater folly, as they now saw it, of med-&#xD;
dling with him at all. Better have run the risk&#xD;
of letting him go at that time, when the most he_&#xD;
could have said would be that he had met a com~&#xD;
pany of unknown men, - for they could easily have&#xD;
concealed their faces so as not to be 'recognized, -&#xD;
than to dismiss him now, after he had learned who&#xD;
they all, were. And yet this, on the whole~eemed&#xD;
the best thing for them now to do. He might&#xD;
easily be detained where he was for a day or two,&#xD;
till they shpub1j have time to reach Derby, and be&#xD;
safe beyond pursuit.&#xD;
This suggestion, however, was at once negative&#xD;
by Mr. Wooster. It might, he said, do. for them,&#xD;
but it would be fatal to him and his family. He&#xD;
had done enough already to bring down upon him&#xD;
the vengeance of the rebel laws, both as an accom-&#xD;
1~&#xD;
p±ice with burglars, and as privy to and a helper of&#xD;
their intended flight to the British lines, which the&#xD;
legislature had made a felony. No; they must&#xD;
take the l~.d with them, and put it out of his power*~&#xD;
to testify against them. Some time after all these'&#xD;
things should be settled by the ending of the war,&#xD;
he might, if he was still alive,'be permitted to&#xD;
return home.&#xD;

&#xD;
These. consicj!eraitions prevailed, and the idea of&#xD;
releasing' Chau ncey was abandoned. Graham, how&#xD;
ever, w~s not satisfied. I-Ic had nothing to fear&#xD;
from the release,, for he expected.. soon to be out of&#xD;
the rea9h. of the rebels, any way, but he greatly&#xD;
disliked the thought of taking the lad with them.&#xD;
He would be a restraint and an annoyance in all&#xD;
their movements, and a constant source of danger.&#xD;
All the goods that Dayton had would be easier to&#xD;
carry than this one tell-tale Yankee boy.&#xD;
At length, during the temporary absence of their&#xD;
host from the room, Graham, in a low voice, but&#xD;
*      with a tone betokening both disgust and i mpa-&#xD;
tience, exclaimed, vehemently,&#xD;
"Well, men, I have made up my mind, and you&#xD;
can do as you like. When you ~agreed to join in&#xD;
this, affair, I thought I was enlisting men, and not a&#xD;
set of white-livered coWards and sneaks. Here We&#xD;
are shivering in the wind because we are afraid&#xD;
that boy ,will go and tell of us, when a single cli6k&#xD;
from one of your old queen's arms would settle the&#xD;
matter for ever. Who and what is he, I should&#xD;
like to know, that we should hesitate to shoot him&#xD;
as we would any other rebel engaged in this war?~&#xD;
Now, it ant of an~ use to play the fool any longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
It's got to fe doiw! if you are too soft-hearted to&#xD;
join me, I'll do it myself without your help; and&#xD;
if you won't consent to this, I'll leave' you, and&#xD;
clear for the island ~s quick as I can go; and ifs,&#xD;
you ever show your heads there,- as yoti've got&#xD;
to, for you can't stay here, - you may find ~a recep~&#xD;
tion that you won't altogether fa~'icy." .&#xD;
A resolute man exerts often an influence upon&#xD;
others greater than the intrinsic x~eight of his&#xD;
words. Graham was such a man, and when thor~&#xD;
roughly in earnest, rarely' failed of carrying his&#xD;
point. He was elder than most of those under&#xD;
his leadership - perhaps forty-five. A native of&#xD;
Ireland, he had resided before the war in the south,&#xD;
where he first joined the American troops under&#xD;
General Moultrie. He was daring and ambitious,&#xD;
and eagerly sought promotion in the army, to&#xD;
which his talents and services, as he thought, justly&#xD;
entitled . him. At the same time he was jealous&#xD;
and easy to take offense; and having on one occa~&#xD;
sion failed to receive the meed of advancement&#xD;
which he coveted, in a fit of anger he forswore&#xD;
the patriot cause, and deserted to the British, by&#xD;
~whom he was transferred to the army at New&#xD;
York, where he received lieutenant's commission,&#xD;

He was a m~n of some address, and from his~&#xD;

he commanded, for the most part, the ready defer-&#xD;

He jeered at their scrupI~s, he ridiculed their soft-&#xD;
heartedness, as he 'called it, declaiming that they&#xD;

EANWHJLE, how passed the time with&#xD;
~ their prisoner in his place of confine~&#xD;

Let our young readers imagine it, for it is not&#xD;
easy to depict the reality. It was not the dreari-&#xD;
ness of the cold, damp apartment, striking a ~sepul-&#xD;
chral chill through his frame; it was not the lone~&#xD;
Jiness of his softude, with no l~indly ~face to behold;&#xD;
and nofriendly oice to rail upon his~ ear, that most&#xD;
oppressed him. 1t was the terrible conviction that&#xD;
he was doomed to die! He had not recovered&#xD;
from the shock of the transaction that morning&#xD;
among the willows of the swamp; and though for'&#xD;
the moment rescued from 'the threatened doom, he&#xD;
felt it was, but a temporary respite. He was in the&#xD;

them had* relented when in no immin nt danger of&#xD;
their own, he cotild not doubt that they would 'be&#xD;
as inexorable as their leader whenever their owi~i&#xD;
safety' could be secured only by sacrificing him.&#xD;
He had heard Graham's muttered imprecations&#xD;
* upon his confederates, and knew that it was his&#xD;
purpose to have his own way still, notwithstanding&#xD;
their opposition.&#xD;
But what was it to die? It is not a thought to&#xD;
which the youn~ mind accustoms itself, and it re-&#xD;
*    quired an effort to conceive of sit. It was to leave&#xD;
home and friends, the father, th~ mother, never&#xD;
so dear as now when he was about to be torn from&#xD;
their loving arms; the young brothers and sisters,&#xD;
playmates and companions of his childhood, bound&#xD;
rtO his heart by ~. thousand ties. It was to be torn&#xD;
from the bright world that looked so attractive to&#xD;
his youthful anticipations. It was t6 have his&#xD;
young life quenched in the blackness of night, in&#xD;
the horrors of the dark, cold grave. Nay, more, it&#xD;
was to go intd the presence of God, his Judge, and,&#xD;
receive from his lips that sentence which should fix&#xD;
his destiny in everlasting j ~y or, woe. Let it not&#xD;
be deemed unmanlj that as e tI~iought of all this&#xD;
he was overcome with terror, and "lifted up his&#xD;
voiCe and wept."&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
BOOSTER'S WELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
163&#xD;
&#xD;
But the storm of anguish spent itself, and he&#xD;
was enabled to look more calmly at his situation.&#xD;
Chauncey, though trained to. the strictest habits of&#xD;
morality, had never professed a personal experience&#xD;
of religion. In those days such' a thing was not&#xD;
expected in the young. Rarely was a person of&#xD;
either sex found in the membership of the church&#xD;
under twenty. We owe it chiefly to our Sunday&#xD;
schools and the increased attention awakened in the&#xD;
religious instruction of the young that things are.&#xD;
so changed in our day, and that so large a. propor-&#xD;
tion of those who are converted and enter the&#xD;
church are of the youth and children.&#xD;
In the deep gloom of his prison there came to&#xD;
him the recollection of Joseph, who was cast into&#xD;
the dungeon for no fault. of his own, and whose&#xD;
prayers God heard, and in due time granted him&#xD;
deliverance. But . could he pray? Had he not&#xD;
hitherto lived in sin, unmindful of the claims of his&#xD;
Father and Saviour, and could he hope now, in,&#xD;
this hour of his necessity, that he would be heard?&#xD;
Still there remained the example, and it seemed to.&#xD;
him as if it was written for those in trouble "Jo-&#xD;
seph prayed and was heard; why rnay~not I ?"&#xD;
'He threw himself upon the cold stone floor and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8224-00000085"/>&#xD;
164            CHAUNCEIr JUD[).&#xD;
poured out his soul unto Go\d. He pleaded for&#xD;
life. He besought some divin ~ interposition which&#xD;
would deliVer him from the crii~iel men into whose&#xD;
power he had fallen. Or.i~' this was denied him, he&#xD;
prayed thatX he might be prepared to die, that his&#xD;
sins might be washed away in the blood of Jesus,&#xD;
and that he might be received into that better&#xD;
worldwher~ there should be no more death, neither&#xD;
sorrow nor crying.&#xD;
And God heard his prayer. Eveii as he spoke,&#xD;
the tempest of anguish and fear subsided, and a&#xD;
gentle peace stole into his heart. He felt that he&#xD;
was no longer alone. The darkness of his prison&#xD;
seemed full of the presence of One who would be&#xD;
his friend. Hope dawned upon his soul, and he&#xD;
grew strong to i}ieet and suffer whatever was be-&#xD;
fore him, for he felt that all would come out right&#xD;
in the end.&#xD;
And through all his subsequent life Chaun~cey&#xD;
never forgot that feeling. The revelation whit~h&#xD;
God males of himself to the heart of his child in&#xD;
such an hour as this is an experience which no&#xD;
after sorrow can' obliterate, ihe earnest and the&#xD;
pledge of the welcome that awaits him when l~c&#xD;
shall reach his Father's house at the last.&#xD;
&#xD;
BOOSTER'S WELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
165&#xD;
&#xD;
But while his prayer was heard, God had his&#xD;
own time and way of answering it. Like that of&#xD;
Jesus himself in Gethsemane~ the bitter cup was&#xD;
to precede the deliverance and' the glory.'&#xD;
Graham, having wrung a reluctant assent to his&#xD;
deed of blood, seized his pistol, and entered, with&#xD;
one or two more, the cellar and dairy-room. After&#xD;
taking a hasty survey of the premises, his eye fell&#xD;
upon the well, which at once suggested to him the&#xD;
mode of carrying his purpose into 'execution. The&#xD;
lad should be shot, and' his body thrown into it, bal-&#xD;
lasted with a heavy weight Which would sink it 'to&#xD;
the bottom.&#xD;
A small Bible was procured from above, and&#xD;
placed in his hands, and he Was bidden to prepare&#xD;
for death. It was a fearful mandate, and though&#xD;
he had become calm in the contemplation sustained&#xD;
by a sense of the divine presence and sympathy,&#xD;
yet, confronted again thus suddenly with so awful a&#xD;
doom, with the dark, deep well yawning:before him,&#xD;
Nature reasserted her instincts, and he burst anew&#xD;
into a passion of tears and importunities for mercy.&#xD;
e begged; he promised silence; he urged this in~&#xD;
nocence, and the wickedness' of th~ act they wer~ '&#xD;
about to commit ;~ but to no purpose. Their minds&#xD;

were made up. The plea of necessity stifled their&#xD;
misgivings, and though all but their leader with-&#xD;
drew from the roorh, it was with no thought: of de-&#xD;
sisting from their purpose. At last, despairing of&#xD;
human help, Chauncey threw himself upon his'&#xD;
knees, and poured out his; anguish jo God; praying*&#xD;
that he whd delivered Joseph from the pit would&#xD;
even~ yet interpose to save him.&#xD;
The pleading, cry of distress rose from the cellar,&#xD;
and was heard by th~ family above. It was more&#xD;
thaW Mrs. Wooster could bear. Her sympathies&#xD;
indeed, 'in political matters,, were those of her hus-&#xD;
band and her sons. She was willing to render aid&#xD;
and comfort to those of t~i at party in all ordinary&#xD;
matters, and did not scrup~ e even to share in the&#xD;
spoils .of the late    n;. but she was not yet&#xD;
ready for murder, unprovoked, and in her own special&#xD;
premises. She was a woman, nay, more, she 'was a&#xD;
mother. The young~ man whose lot 'it had been tq&#xD;
fall into these cruel hands was a son, innocent and&#xD;
amiabIe~\ His mother was 'her&#xD;
'      neighbor, against&#xD;
whom the tongue of scandal was never heard to&#xD;
speak. She could not,' and she would not, let such&#xD;

pany her, she hastened' down stairs, and threw her-&#xD;
self between the victim and his. murderers, Who&#xD;
were just preparing to execute their purpose.&#xD;
"For shame!" she cried. "Are you men, or&#xD;
wolves, to kill a' poor boy in this way? I tell you,*&#xD;
it shan't be done, - 'not in this house! Mr. Woos-&#xD;

"Better not meddle with' what does not cciiacern&#xD;

"It does concern me," she repeated. "I'll not&#xD;
have murder committed here. Let him alone, Sam!&#xD;
Take your hands off him, Captain !"&#xD;
She was a' large and powerful woman, and once&#xD;
thoroughly aroused was a match for' any antagonist.&#xD;
Her husband took her by the arm and bade David&#xD;
seize the other to drag her away. But she resisted&#xD;
~th~ir united' strength, and at last, turning at bay,&#xD;
she cried, -&#xD;
"David Wooster, 'hear 'me! Stop these proceed-&#xD;

&#xD;
The loud tones of the excited woman, accom-&#xD;
panied by the shrieks of her daughter, were irre-&#xD;
sistible. Wooster himself relented, for he knew&#xD;
the spirit and resolution of his wife, and saw that&#xD;
informers from his own family would be more dan-&#xD;
gerous than the testimony of the young man him-&#xD;
self, while the added crime of murder would bring&#xD;
the entire party to the'gallows.&#xD;
"Well, captains" he said, "a willful woman must&#xD;
have her own way. You will have to give up to&#xD;
her. It is a rathe+ hatd case, I own, and you'd&#xD;
better keep him with you as long as you caqn: If&#xD;
you get into straits so that you must, why then&#xD;
you must. But may be you will get away safely,&#xD;
after all; and if you do yoti~ll be glad you had not&#xD;
done it."&#xD;
The robbery sUbmitted, but with an ill grace, and&#xD;
muttered curses upon "women that couldn't mind&#xD;
leaving Chauncey with his deliverers. His grati-&#xD;
their own business," and returned to the kitchen,&#xD;
tude to them knew no bounds. He said that God'&#xD;
had sent them to him in' answer to his prayer, and&#xD;
he poured out ~is thanksgiving both, to them and&#xD;
his heavenly whose messengers they were.&#xD;
The reaction from, the intense excitement of the&#xD;
&#xD;
few minutes before, together with the moving utter-&#xD;
ances of the youth, were too much for their forti-&#xD;
tude, and they burst into tears. Chauncey begged&#xD;
them still to befriend him, but they said they could&#xD;
do no 'more than to see that he was safe while&#xD;
there. They did not believe, however, that the&#xD;
crime would, be attempted again, and encouraged&#xD;
him to trust that God, who, as he thought, had twice&#xD;
interfered to save him, would protect him still, and&#xD;
finally bring him to his friends in safety.&#xD;
It was but a fe{v minutes after this when the&#xD;
door from the room above opened, and William,&#xD;
Seeley appeared at the head of the stairs.&#xD;
"I've come to tell you," he cried, "th~.t ~ou had&#xD;
better take care of yourselves. There's a party of&#xD;
men coming u~ the road 1yond4 that I suspect are&#xD;
* looking for you; you can see them plainly from the&#xD;

"There," he continued, as several of the men&#xD;
* sprang up the stairs to reconnoiter, "look for your-&#xD;
selves! There are Mr. Judd and two or three of&#xD;
his sons, Reuben and Daniel Williams, Sam Hickox,&#xD;

This announcement threw the party into instant&#xD;
confusion. Their first impulse wa~ to spring to&#xD;
their arms and stand upon self-defense, but a mo-&#xD;
ment's reflection showed then~ that it would be&#xD;
madness to think of contendir~g with 'many times&#xD;
their own number equally ~with them-&#xD;
selves. Happily for them, the road from the Long-&#xD;
meadoW valley ascer~d9d a long hill, which some-&#xD;
what retarded their advance and partially concealed&#xD;

shoulders and seizing their weapons, they brought&#xD;
their prisoner from below, and fled through the&#xD;
wooa-shed into the street westward, where they&#xD;
were out of sight of the approaching party, and&#xD;
after running a few rods in that direction, they&#xD;
sprang over the fence into the woods. Mr. Woos-&#xD;
ter and Seeley repaired with equal celerity to the&#xD;
barn, which stood by the road-side in the oppo-&#xD;
site direction, where they vigorously resumed their&#xD;
.threshing, expecting that the pursuers would call&#xD;
first upon them, and might be detained a few mo-&#xD;
ments in conversation until the fugitives should&#xD;
have time to escape.&#xD;

The party that were in search of the&#xD;
missing boy, being joined with those who had come&#xD;
from Bethany upon the track of the burglars, set&#xD;
forth. from Mr. Judd's with eager expectation.. The&#xD;
latter were on horseback, the former mostly on&#xD;
foot, Nearly all were armed, and fully resolved, if&#xD;
the plunderers m'ade any resistance, to ~shoot them&#xD;
upon the spot. I&#xD;
A few minutes brought them to the house of&#xD;
Mr. Jobamah Gunn. That gentleman had returned&#xD;
from his early ,morning ride, and professed entire&#xD;
ignorance as to the men they were inquiring after.&#xD;
He declared positively that they had not been at&#xD;

tradict his assertions~ At the barn, however, there&#xD;
were very manifest traces of somebody besides the&#xD;
usual employees of the farm.. The hay in the bays&#xD;
j3Ore the appearance of having been tumbled about&#xD;
*   in an extraord mary manner.  On the barn floor&#xD;
were found some remnants of a meal - a bit of&#xD;
bone, a crust of bread, and a fragment of fat sliced&#xD;
ham; ~nd on one of the 'beams, a short tobacco&#xD;
pipe, which seemed to have been laidthere and&#xD;
forgotten.~ The family professed to be unable to&#xD;
account for these, Mrs. Gunn protesting that' she&#xD;
knew nothing of what had been done in 'the barn.&#xD;
The kitchen woman, however, was not skillful&#xD;
enough to evade their inquiries. Tangled by their&#xD;
sharp cross-examination, she w~is at last obliged to&#xD;
confess that some men had slept in that place the&#xD;
night previous, and that these had compelled her&#xD;
1&#xD;
mistress and herself to 'get t~iein breakfast 'that&#xD;
morning, but they went away early, and where&#xD;
they then 'Were she did not know.&#xD;
~Satisfied that they were on the right track, the&#xD;
pursuers pushed on rapidly, and. soon reached Mr.&#xD;
Wooster's, as related. A portion, of 2 them stopped&#xD;
at the barn, where he and S&amp;amp;eley were threshing,&#xD;
and a part passed on to the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
Short and uncer~mOniOuS were the greetings&#xD;
which in those days* were used when persons of~&#xD;

"Good 'afternoon,. Uncle David," said the fore-&#xD;
most; "Isuppose you can guess what we've come&#xD;
for. Somewhere in this cursed nest of stories thd~e.&#xD;
robbers are hid that plundered Captain 'Dayton's&#xD;

If you know anything about them, you had better&#xD;
own up, if you don't want' a taste of Old Simsbury."&#xD;
"I certainly don't know where either David or&#xD;
Henry is," replied Mr. Wooster. "They havq been&#xD;
here to-day, but 'they went away some time ago,&#xD;
~hd didn't sa~ where they were going."&#xD;
"Was there anybody here with th~m?"&#xD;
"Well, xve've been threshing here, Seeley and I,&#xD;
pretty much all 'day, and I have not paid, much&#xD;

now. We are going to see, what we can find on&#xD;
your premises, and if you don't like it, you. can&#xD;
prosecute us if you want to."&#xD;
.So saying, they dispersed themselves 'through&#xD;
the barn and out~-houses; they looked under the&#xD;
hay and the grain; peered iiito oat-bins and sta-&#xD;
bles, and wherever else it was possible the robbers&#xD;
or their booty might be concealed, but of c~ours ~&#xD;
they were not successful. Then' they passed on&#xD;
to the house, where 'a similar work was already&#xD;
going on.&#xD;
The chambers and attics were examined; the&#xD;
~beds overhauled, kitchen; pantries and wash-room&#xD;
visited. Then th~y went below to the' basement&#xD;
kitchen and cellar. Nothing positive was found&#xD;
ere, for the table and dishes used at dinner l~ad&#xD;
been removed, but the fire still burning on the&#xD;
hearth, and the' odor of tobacco, suggesting recent&#xD;
o ccupati~n, excited suspicions.&#xD;

"And I should like to know, too," continued a&#xD;
third, "whether ~he smokes when she is washing.&#xD;

that's certain."&#xD;
Mrs. Wooster, meantime, played her part to per-&#xD;

ter with as much apparent composure as if it was&#xD;
only a children's. frolic which was going on. To&#xD;
their questions.' respecting the suspected persons,&#xD;
she only replied that they were not there, and she&#xD;
did not know where they were. As to the fire in&#xD;
the basement, about which they inquired, she said&#xD;
that she had been doing some kitchen work ther&amp;amp;,&#xD;
and that Seeley had been in once or twice, who,&#xD;
like other old soldiers, was an inveterate smoker,&#xD;
as they very well knew. These representations,&#xD;
with the evident good order of the house and the&#xD;
quiet demeanor of ~ts mistress, were already 'pro-.&#xD;

will certainly be found. The theft cannot be con-&#xD;
cealed 'long, and the more you attempt it the worse&#xD;
it will be for ydu. To conceal a crime is just as,&#xD;
punishable by the law as t9 commit it.'&#xD;
Mrs. Wooster saw that she was involved in a&#xD;
dilemma from ~vhich there was no apparent way of&#xD;
escape. She knew that goods of the description&#xD;
referred to were in the house, although all the men&#xD;
but David had carried away their packs with them,&#xD;
'and from the resolute purpose and increasing num-&#xD;
ber of the pursuers, she could not doubt' that they&#xD;
would make ~good their threatening. She began&#xD;
likewise to see~ 'the dangers to which these pro-&#xD;
'ceedings were exposing her husband and all the&#xD;
family, as well as herself. At last she said,&#xD;
"I don't. know anything about the robbery,' as&#xD;
you call it, if there 'has been one, or who was&#xD;
en gaged in it. I am wiWhg to show you the' dress&#xD;
which HaPinah has, and anything else of the kind&#xD;
there is 'in the house. We don't intend to counte-&#xD;

SQ saying, she departed, but soon returned with&#xD;
the aforesaid garment, and one or two similar arti-&#xD;
cles which had been given to herself and others of&#xD;
the family. These were recognized as answering&#xD;
to the description contained in the advertisement.&#xD;
As to any knowledge of wher&amp;amp; David and* his con-&#xD;
federates then were, she declared positively that&#xD;
she had none.&#xD;
A consultation was then held by the searching&#xD;
party as to the course to be pursued. It was evi-&#xD;
dent that the gang of plunderers were not there,&#xD;
and equally evident that they had but recently left.&#xD;
Of course Mr. Wooster and his wife were both&#xD;
guilty of harboring and concealing them~ ~De4qon&#xD;

ordered' that the former, together with William&#xD;
Seeley, should be arrested and put under ~keepers,&#xD;
and that a sufficient guard should be stationed in&#xD;
the house to apprehend tfle robbers themselves if&#xD;
they should return there.&#xD;

He had himself returned from the pursuit sho tly&#xD;

ascertained as to the robbers, confirming the the-&#xD;
ory they had entertained that Chauncey had been&#xD;
carried away by them. Jndeed, the elder David&#xD;
Wooster and Seeley, after their arrest, finding that&#xD;
* longer denial was useless, confessed that the rob-&#xD;
bers had been at his house, and that the missing&#xD;
young man was with them. The intelligence, while&#xD;
* it relieved the suspense occasioned by their entire&#xD;
ignorance as to what had become of him, only&#xD;
turned their solicitude into new channels.&#xD;

and subject to fatigue, loss of sleep, and constant&#xD;
apprehension of discovery, in all which, except the&#xD;
last, Chauncey himself was compelled to share.&#xD;
I-fe was a slender youth, tenderly nurtured, and.&#xD;
little accustomed to such hardships. So the moth-&#xD;
er's imagination depicted the sufferings he was&#xD;
enduring, and with the acute sensibilities of her&#xD;
own affection, suffering with him in ther~i all.&#xD;
The neighbors gathered there, both .to manifest&#xD;
their sympathy and to learn what reports came, from&#xD;
those who had gone in the pursuit. Ditha Webb&#xD;
had been there nearly all the afternoon, and' though&#xD;
the evening was. growing* late, could not persuade&#xD;
herself to return home. Indeed, she would not&#xD;
have dared to pass on the road.where that dreadful&#xD;
party of men had been the night before, and so&#xD;
accepted the urgent invitation of the family to stay&#xD;
with Ruth and Anna all night. From time, to&#xD;
time some of the young men engaged in the pur-&#xD;
suit returned, bringing word of the progress they&#xD;
were making, and of the thousand rumors; and&#xD;
surmises that were flying about, which ministered&#xD;
fresh fuel to the excitement, and kept all minds in&#xD;
a state of most painful expectation.&#xD;

~heart turns instinctively to the diVine sympathy&#xD;
and help. ~Mrs. Judd sat apart a little from~ the&#xD;
group of young people that' chattered so inces-&#xD;

nestling upon her knee. Like the mother of Sam-&#xD;

the Lord, and wept sore," not indeed with audible&#xD;
sobs, but with the inward cry of a mother's break~&#xD;

that the others were safe, when this one lamb, the&#xD;

in the wilderness?&#xD;
And there was given to her the answer which&#xD;

DAYTON'S DEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
BOUT a mile and 'a half west of David&#xD;
Wooster's is a naked bluff of rocks, the&#xD;
/     extremity of which breaks into a jagged&#xD;
precipice overlooking the valley below. 13y some&#xD;
geological convulsion its strata have' been raised&#xD;
into a nearly vertical position, and having fallen a&#xD;
little apart, they open into several seams and cr~v-&#xD;
ices, the largest of which is of sufficient width to&#xD;
~dmit a man. A few feet from the entrance at the&#xD;
bottom is a cross crevice of about the same lateral&#xD;
dimensions, which, extending in~ a tortuous passage&#xD;
upward, affords, an outlet at the top of the ledge.&#xD;
Whether the place had, any particular designation&#xD;
then, we do not know, but at present, by a singular&#xD;
confusion of names, it is known in that region&#xD;
as "Dayton's Den," as if Dayton himself, and&#xD;

not the plunderers of his house, had made it a&#xD;
refuge.&#xD;
The woods into which. the robbers fled, after&#xD;
their departure from Mr. Wooster's, extended along&#xD;
~~the slope of the rocky eminence all the way~ to the&#xD;
den, and by keeping themselves within the thicket,&#xD;
they reached this hidingplace unperceived.&#xD;
It was not a very comfortable retreat. There&#xD;
Was barely room enough to stand within the crev-&#xD;
ices, and being situated in the eastern face of the&#xD;
cliff, it was exposed to the bleak wind blowing&#xD;
from the north-east, with the coming tempest in its&#xD;
breath. But its lonely position, remote from any&#xD;
road, and so elevated as to command a view of all&#xD;
the approaches to it gave them present safety.&#xD;
They dared not make a fire lest the smoke should&#xD;
betray them,' but gathering a 'few dry bushes, they&#xD;
stopped the 'entrance so as partially to exclude~ the&#xD;
wind, and waited for the night, which would permit&#xD;
them to pursue their flight.&#xD;
Near the foot of the hill below them - perhaps&#xD;
one hundred rods distant lived another of the&#xD;
prominent stories of the region, named Noah Can-&#xD;
~ dee. He was a coarse, rough. man, and one of the&#xD;
most violent of his party. His house was a favor-&#xD;

scheme of treasonous villainy had been plotted&#xD;
under his roof.&#xD;
He was a blacksmith by trade, and besides his&#xD;
farming operations, was accustomed, especially' in&#xD;
the winter, to work in his 'shop, where the teams&#xD;
of the neighboring farmers were brought to be&#xD;
'shod, their ox-chains mended, their axes relaid, etc.&#xD;
Such 'a place, almost as much' as the village tavern,&#xD;
became a center of news. The rumors that were&#xD;
afloat as to the war, the measures of the Congress&#xD;
at Philadelphia, 'the depreciation of the currency,&#xD;
the hard times, and all the usual, sayings and do~&#xD;
ings of the town were detailed and commented on&#xD;
by the idlers and loafers, who loved .the cheerful&#xD;
fires of the forge, and, above all, the cider which he&#xD;
was as generous in dispensing as he was in 'imbib-&#xD;
ing himself.&#xD;
To the refugees in the rocks the minutes moved&#xD;
on leaden wings. Cooped up in their inconvenient&#xD;
quarters, and shivering with cold, they were in any-~&#xD;
thing but an amiable mood.' Finally, Graham sug-'&#xD;
gested that one~ of them should venture down to&#xD;

the bleak cave where they then were. Nobody&#xD;
was willing to encounter the 'peril. After a little&#xD;
wrangling over the matter, however, Scott volun-&#xD;
teered to go. The rest, from their elevated look-&#xD;
6ut, were to keep watch, and if the pursuers were&#xD;
seeii approaching the house, a~ signal should be&#xD;
given by hanging one of theii~ hats on a stick&#xD;
thrust into one of the crevices of the rocks.&#xD;
Cautiously the scout descended the hill toward&#xD;
Candee's, skulking along behind the trees and&#xD;
fences. As he drew near the house, he heard the&#xD;
sound of the anvil in the. shop, and concluding that&#xD;
Candee was there, he passed on to the rear of 'it,.&#xD;
and after, examining the interior through a crack in&#xD;
th~ boards, ventured to enter.&#xD;
As it happened, nobody was in the shop but&#xD;
Candee himself, and one of his tory neighbors,&#xD;
named Daniel Johnson. He had been down to the&#xD;
bridge in Judd's Meadow that afternoon, where he&#xD;
had learned of' the events ~vhich were exciting that&#xD;
region, and had stopped at the shop, in passing, to&#xD;
relate the news to Candee. The two were engaged&#xD;
in discussing the affair, and calculating~ the chances&#xD;

"I suppose. they are," was the reply. "We got&#xD;

"Nor I, either," added Jolmson; "you have no&#xD;

they had* not passed his shop, as he had been at&#xD;
work there all the afternoon. But his word was&#xD;
not sufficient. His character was' too well known&#xD;
~s that of an unscrupulous tory, and they proceeded&#xD;
to search his house and barn, but of course with-&#xD;
out success.&#xD;
After they left, Candee took a bottle of liquor in&#xD;
his pocket, and went to his barn, ostensibly for the&#xD;
purpose of foddering his cattle and putting them&#xD;
up for the night. But this task having been com-&#xD;
pleted, he cautiously went up the hill, keeping him-&#xD;
self out of sight of the house, in the range of 4&#xD;
barn, to the haunt of the secreted men. He found&#xD;
them gloomy and despondent, and his own wQrds&#xD;
did not tend to reassure them. His liquor, how-&#xD;
ever, was received with great satisfaction. He&#xD;
advised them to stay where they were till after&#xD;
dark, a~d even then to wait for word from Johnson&#xD;
or himself as to when it would be safe for them to&#xD;
move.&#xD;
After searching Candee's premises, the pursuers&#xD;
continued their co3irse as far as Johnson's, whose.&#xD;
house they treated in a similar manner. Finding,&#xD;
however, no trace of the fugitives, they concluded&#xD;

was standing till within ,two or three years, past.&#xD;
Captain Wooster kept a tavern .of some celebrity,&#xD;

'the leading men of the town.&#xD;
It was to this house of their uncle that David&#xD;

which had been seen through the windows was in&#xD;
the parlor, on the opposite side of the hall from&#xD;
the bar-room, these two being the front rooms&#xD;

cases, having 1~een prolonged till late in the night.&#xD;
Being familiar with the premises, the young men&#xD;

the fire, where, overcome with their fatigue, several&#xD;
Qf them, Chauncey included, presently fell asleep.&#xD;
Two. or three prostrated themselves upon the floor,&#xD;
and were soon in a heavy slumber. At the same&#xD;
time, t~e question again arose of a lodgring~ there for&#xD;
the night, when the larndlady reiterated the fact&#xD;
that ~e had but ene unoccupied bed; so that- it&#xD;
would Ibe absolutely impossible to accommodat&#xD;
more than two of their number.&#xD;
" Well, then," said David, " two will take the bed,&#xD;
*  and the rest of us will, do..as we can. There's&#xD;
*  Cady, xkho ,seems to have settled the matter for&#xD;
himself on the floor.. If we only had some blan-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
kets, Aunt Eunice, we might all do the same ; it&#xD;
would be a great sight better than to turn out into&#xD;
the snow again, such a night as this."&#xD;
" But I haven't got spare blankets enough for&#xD;
you all," she replied. " Besides, to tell the truth, I&#xD;
don't think you had better stay here any way. I've&#xD;
a strong suspicion that. you an't in any honest&#xD;
business. Toby says that he heard just at night&#xD;
that a great robbery -had been committed some-&#xD;
where over in Bethany, and that the robbers had,&#xD;
been tracked to Gunntown. He said, too, there&#xD;
was a boy or' young rnan missing, whom, ist was&#xD;
suspected,'they have murdered or carried off with&#xD;
them. I shouldn't wonder if you were e  vry&#xD;
rogues!"&#xD;
" Oh no, Aunt E nice," was the reply, half seri-&#xD;
ous and half banter, ." you don't think so bally of&#xD;
us as that, I hope. .The fact is, we have been&#xD;
drifted into the militia to go into the army, and we&#xD;
don't mean to go ; so we are just hiding out -of the&#xD;
way for a few days."&#xD;
" MiIitia ? Nonsense ! There has not been such&#xD;
a. thing as a draft lately - you know there ha'n't.&#xD;
Besides, who is that young fellow nodding in his&#xD;
chair there ? He looks as if he was ready-to drop.&#xD;

I tell you, David, I believe 'he's the very boy you've&#xD;
stolen, and that you all deserve a hanging.&#xD;
"He? Oh, he's all right. Appears to beta little&#xD;
tuckered out now, and so we all are, but he'll be&#xD;
wide awake in the morning."&#xD;
x&#xD;
"Well, I don't like the looks f things," conti~-&#xD;
ued the lady. "There's these pa ~ks of yours; what&#xD;
have you got in them? Stolen ~o~ds ?"&#xD;
"Oh, a few things that we're going to carry down&#xD;
I,,&#xD;
to the Landing. May be 'we can find a nice silk&#xD;
apron, or something else, in ~them for you; that&#xD;
is," he added in a 'lower voice, and with a ~ignifi-&#xD;
cant expression, "if you'll let us stay, and keep your&#xD;
Zips shut' I"&#xD;
Mrs. Wooster hesitated, and after a moment's&#xD;
reflection, went into the bed-room to consult her&#xD;
husband. While she was there, David said, -&#xD;
"Come, fellows, she'll let u~ stay but a~ we can't&#xD;
all have the bed, we'll draw cuts or thai, and the&#xD;
rest of us will go out to the barn. Not a bad place&#xD;
to sleep in, in a pold winter night, under the hay.&#xD;
I've tried it many a time."&#xD;
This proposal was assented to by all the others&#xD;
who were sufficiently awake to;give heed to the con-&#xD;
versatiomv ' Espying his aunt's~ broom st in a&#xD;
&#xD;
corner of the room, David seized it, and broke off&#xD;
Several of the fibers'~ of the corn of which it was&#xD;
made, and cut 'them into eight pieces of unequal&#xD;
length; then holdi 'g them between his thumband&#xD;
forefingere~ he bade each m~n draw one out, it be-&#xD;
ing understood that the~$~o who drew the longest&#xD;
pieces should have the bed.&#xD;
They all drew but Chauncey and the two sleepers&#xD;
on the ~floor. Wooster pushed one of these with&#xD;
his' foot, exclaiming, "Wake up,. sleepy-head, and&#xD;
draw for your chance." But the spell in which&#xD;
the latter was sunk was too deep to be easily&#xD;
broken', and muttering something about being let&#xD;
alone; he went off again in a doze.&#xD;
"Let them sleep," said Graham, "and1 I'll draw&#xD;
for them. Here, Wooster, hold your hand to me."&#xD;
The drawing was thus completed, and the' prize&#xD;
fell to Graham and Doolittle.&#xD;
Mrs. WoOster related to. her husband her suspi-&#xD;
cions respecting 1.her unwelcome guests. He re-.&#xD;
fused to get u~, but sent for David and Henry to~&#xD;
come to him in the bed-room.&#xD;
"What *ddes all this mean, boys?" said he.&#xD;

Of course that is mere pretense. There an't any&#xD;
draft, and you are in no danger. You've been&#xD;
about some mischief, If believe. What is th'i~ bur-&#xD;
glary we've just been hearing of? Do you know&#xD;
anything about it ?."&#xD;
"We don't call it any such name as that," they&#xD;
replied. "Everybody knows that Dayton got his&#xD;
money by privateering and plundering the loyal&#xD;
people on the island. His house was full of goods,&#xD;
which he had brought over from there in that wdy.&#xD;
What's the harm, we want to know, if we shOuld&#xD;
just carry some of them back again where they&#xD;
came from, even if it be done without his consent."&#xD;
"1 can't say what's the harm," replied the cap-&#xD;

cussed. Captain Wooster expressed strong disap~&#xD;
proval of their conduct, not so much from its crim-&#xD;
inality as for the danger and disgrace they would&#xD;
incur, and the trouble they were likely to bring&#xD;
upon all their friends who should harbor or assist&#xD;
them, and reiterated his advice that they should&#xD;
escape from that neighborhood as speedily as pos-&#xD;
sible. This they promised to do. He advised them,&#xD;
further, if they could not leave that night, to retire&#xD;
to a barn bel6nging to his brother Daniel Wooster,&#xD;
which stbod in the meadow, some sixty rods south&#xD;
of his house. The driving storm would probably&#xD;
cover their tracks, and they might possibly be safe&#xD;
there till the next nigl~t.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Fabrique, whom Rath had left&#xD;
in the front room while she went to assist her&#xD;
mother, becoming tired of waiting for her return,&#xD;
followed into the kitchen to see who they were that&#xD;
made such unusual demands upon the hospitalities&#xD;

they soon fell intQ conversation, and presently they&#xD;
were invited to return with him into the parlor&#xD;

Graham professed to have recently come from the&#xD;
army; indeed, Doolittle hinted that he was a Con-&#xD;
tinental officer. Of course he had much to tell&#xD;
that would iPter~st his auditors. Finally, the hour&#xD;
~having. waxed late, Mr. Fakriqu~ drew his watch,&#xD;
*     and remarked that it was past midnight, and time&#xD;
for him to go home. He rose to leave, when Doo..&#xD;
little interposed.&#xD;
"Don't go yet, sir. You seem to have a fine&#xD;
watch there.~ Will you let me see it?&#xD;
Watches were very scarce in those days, and the&#xD;
possession ~of ~ne marked a person at once as of&#xD;
more than ordinary distinction and wealth. Mr.&#xD;
Fa~rique complied with the request, and handed&#xD;
him the watch, a heavy, old-fashioned silver&#xD;
"bull's-eye," with ~a showy~ seal and key.,&#xD;
The watch was examined with much interest.&#xD;
The case was opeh~d, within which lay a curiously&#xD;
constructed double heart, made of paper of differ-&#xD;
ent colors, cut into strip&amp;amp; and woven together, the&#xD;
-~conventional emblem of true love and lasting union.&#xD;
The tell-tale blush on Miss Ruth's fair face left it&#xD;
not difficult to conjecture by whose fingers it had&#xD;
been fashioned.&#xD;
It is said that the native born New Englander&#xD;
&#xD;
CAPTAIN JOHN BOOSTER'S.&#xD;
&#xD;
203&#xD;
&#xD;
may be recognized the world over by throne ques-&#xD;
tion, which is ever on his lips, " What did it cost ?"'&#xD;
HQwever that may be, Doolittle vindicated his&#xD;
claim to be a native by making that inquiry now,&#xD;
adding another equally characteristic: "What will&#xD;
you take for it?" It would be, he thought, some-&#xD;
thing very pleasant to possess, ancj the, me ney&#xD;
which he had obtained at, Captain Dayton's was&#xD;
just in time to enable him to buy such an expexi-&#xD;
sive luxury.&#xD;
"Oh," said Fabrique, "I should not want to part&#xD;
with it, I think. I have become very much attached&#xD;
to it, and couldn't think of taking a penny less than&#xD;
fifteen pounds for' it, seals and all, hard money,&#xD;
though that may be something more than' it is ac-&#xD;
tually worth."&#xD;
The other had placed the 'watch in his pocket, or&#xD;
rather under his waistband, in th&amp;amp; jiace where the&#xD;
fob woPld have been if he had had 'one, and was&#xD;
admiring the graceful swing of the' chain and its&#xD;
appendages. Its attractions were too great to be&#xD;
resisted, even though the * price named was e~orbi-&#xD;
tant. Returning for his pack to the kitchen, he drew&#xD;
from it a bag heavily freighted with: coin, and cGunt-&#xD;
ing out fifty Spanish silver dollars, handed them to&#xD;
Mr. Fabrique, saying, -&#xD;

&#xD;
CAPTAIN JOHN WOOSTER'S.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It's a bargain,'sir. Here's. your money, good&#xD;
and true, and the watch is mine."'&#xD;
The latter was taken entirely by surprise, for he&#xD;
had not supposed it possible that a person of Doo~-&#xD;
little's appearance coul advance such a sum as&#xD;
this. At first he demurred to ~the sale, declaring&#xD;
that he had not made the offer in earnest, but&#xD;
Doolittle persisted in saying it was a bargain, 'and&#xD;
the gentleman was. obliged to console himself&amp;amp; as&#xD;
he best could with the reflection 'that he had re-&#xD;
ceived for the watch twice its value.&#xD;
Just at 'this' t inge, two horsemen rode up to the&#xD;
tavern, and havin hitched their horses in the shed,&#xD;
came to the door %nd knocked for admittance. Im-&#xD;
mediately Grahat 'and Doolittle retreated to the&#xD;
kitchen, where they announced the new-comers, and&#xD;
called upon their comrades to stir 'themselves, and&#xD;
hasten to their place of lodging for the night.&#xD;
The strangers proved to be residents of Betha-&#xD;
ny, Dr. Jesse Carrington and Mr. Isaab Hotchkiss,,&#xD;
who had been engaged in the search for the gang&#xD;
1Rev. Smith Dayton informs me that several years after&#xD;
this, Mr. F abrique came 'and paid to his mother, Mrs. Day-&#xD;
ton, the money he had received from the robber for this&#xD;
watch, with the interest .accruing from it to that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
of robbers. Seeing a light at, the 'inn, they halted&#xD;
to make inquiries. -While fastening their horses in&#xD;
the shed, they had perceived a musket standing~&#xD;
there, which one of the party had carelessly left ;&#xD;
'and this excited their suspicions that possibly the&#xD;
persons they were seeking were in that house.&#xD;
They were received by' Ruth Wooster, who in-&#xD;
formed them that her parents 'had retired to bed.&#xD;
Their object in calling at that late hour, they said,&#xD;
was to inquire after the perpetrators of the crint~e&#xD;
just committed, as description of whom was given&#xD;
'in the .'andbills they ,showed. They inquired' par-&#xD;
ticularly if she knew anything about the gun they&#xD;
had found in the horse-shed, or whether' any per-&#xD;
sons carrying muskets had been there during the&#xD;
'day before.&#xD;
She' replied that two men had taken lodgings at&#xD;
the' house that night, whom. she understood to be&#xD;
officers in the Continental army, as they were in&#xD;
military dress ; but .of course these could not be&#xD;
among the robbers. It was possible that the gun&#xD;
belonged to one of; them. As to any others, she&#xD;
felt sure that they could not be in the house (cer-&#xD;
tain noises which had come from the, kitchen con-&#xD;
vincing her that they had already departed). These&#xD;

positive assurances seemed satisfactory, and the&#xD;
presence of the gentleman who was manifestly&#xD;
"keeping company" with her sufficiently explained&#xD;
the light they had seen in the house; so, remarking&#xD;
that it was quite late, and with a sly caution frbm&#xD;
the doctor not to sit tip too long if she would not&#xD;
drive the roses from her cheeks altogether, the gen-&#xD;
tlemen took their departure.&#xD;
But they had very nearly discovered the persons&#xD;
of whom they' were in pursuit. The' alarm which&#xD;
had been given in the kitchen roused the sleepers&#xD;
on the hearth, but so deeply were they under the&#xD;
spell of slumber, that their movements were ~&#xD;
ceedingly clumsy~ Cady' had pulled off his wet&#xD;
shoes to dry his feet ~t the fire, and ~now found&#xD;
it difficult to put them on again; indeed, in~ the&#xD;
haste and' confusion, he did not succeed in so do-&#xD;
ing, but was hurried away out of the back d&amp;amp;or in.&#xD;
his stockings. A few minutes later, Graham and&#xD;
Doolittle were shown up stairs by Mrs. Wooster,&#xD;
who now re-appeared 'from the bed-room. The rest,&#xD;
as Captain Woostcr~' had advised, leaped the fence,&#xD;
and piloted by David, who knew' the way, were&#xD;
soon snugly ensconced in the hayr in his uncle&#xD;

APTAIN WOOSTER'S most important&#xD;
helps in 'the management of his farm' and&#xD;
tavern were a colored man, named To-&#xD;
biah, and his wife ~Rachel.&#xD;
At that time slavery was recognized. arid pro~&#xD;
tected by law in Connecticut. It was ~always of&#xD;
a comparatively mild type, being. free from most&#xD;
of those oppressive features which in later years&#xD;
attached to the institution 'in our southern states.&#xD;
The marriage of slaves wa~ legal; they might own&#xD;
property, and, if they could, learn to read and&#xD;
write; indeed, ~most people felt it to be their' re-&#xD;
ligious duty to see that their negroes were so far&#xD;
instructed as to be able to read the Bible. Though&#xD;
subject to chastisement for petty offenses, they&#xD;
weye protected by law, an~d by that public senti-&#xD;

ment which is more powerful than law, from the&#xD;
inhumanities to which the system nearly 'always&#xD;
gives rise. Indeed, the condition 'of a slave, except&#xD;
what pertained to his social status, differed from&#xD;
that of a free man chiefly in that his services were&#xD;
compulsory, and without' compensation.&#xD;
Few slaves were, or ever had been, held in'&#xD;
Waterbury. "The great proportion of the early&#xD;
settlers," say~ Bronson, "were too poor "to own&#xD;
that kind of property. 'Luxuries of all kinds were&#xD;
beyond their reach. They lived in the plainest&#xD;
manner, and did their own work. Owing to a lack&#xD;
'of~ tools, machinery, roads, and productive lands'&#xD;
prepared for tillage, or, in other words, capital, the&#xD;
~urplus products of labor were small.' Compara-&#xD;
tively, a man could d little more than maintain&#xD;
himself. Hence the necessity that all should work&#xD;
young and old, male \and female. If the addition&#xD;
of a negro to a family i ~i~ea~ed production, it also&#xD;
increased consumption, and, if a support in infancy&#xD;
and old age £5 taken ihto the account, almost in an&#xD;
equal ratio. ~iei~ce the inducement with 'the early&#xD;
planters in Waterbury to own slaves could not&#xD;
have been great, even could they have foi4nd the&#xD;
means to purchase them."&#xD;
&#xD;
TOBIAH AND RACHEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
The few slaves that were held in this town seem~&#xD;
tQ have belonged mostly to the clergymen. Rev.&#xD;
Messrs. Southmayd, Leavenworth, and Scovill, of&#xD;
Waterbury 'Center, and Rev. Mr. Trumbull, of&#xD;
Westbury, now Watertown;' owned two' each&#xD;
generally a man and woman. One of these, named&#xD;
Dick, ~once owned by Mr. Scovilj, died in 1835,&#xD;
at the age of ninety. Some half a dozen other&#xD;
persons are' mentioned as holding this species&#xD;
of property. In Derby, Rev. Daniel Humphreys&#xD;
had' two slaves, named ~ambridg~ and Kate, his&#xD;
wife. Dr. Mansfield had several, and many more&#xD;
were held by other wealthy men of the town. In..&#xD;
deed, Derby having been a seaport, enjoying,, before&#xD;
the war, a considerable trade with the West Indies,&#xD;
had imported numerous slaves from those islands,&#xD;
so that1 there was comparatively a large colored&#xD;
population in the town.&#xD;
In some cases the slaves were Indians. In the&#xD;
earlier periods of New England, the practice of&#xD;
reducing the aborigines to bondage' prevailed quite&#xD;
extensively through all the colonies.&#xD;
Nor were slaves procured from the colored races&#xD;
'alone. Not a few emigrants from En gland and&#xD;
Irekrnd, who were too poor to pay their. passage,&#xD;

were sold, with their own consent, on their arrival,&#xD;
for a limited times In one of the newspapers at&#xD;
New Haven, under date of 1764, is an advertise-&#xD;
ment of "a parcel of Irish servants, both men and&#xD;
women, to be sold cheap." Thieves, vagrants, and&#xD;
"all single persons who live an idle and riotous&#xD;
life," might, by prder of any court or a justice of&#xD;
the peace, be bound out to service for a term of&#xD;
years, or for life. Our fathers were inveterate foes&#xD;
to idleness, and the common saying about birds&#xD;
they applied to men, "He that can work and won't&#xD;
work, must be made to work."&#xD;
At the time of the Revolution, the essential&#xD;
wrongfulness of slavery, except for the punishment&#xD;
of offenders, began to be commonly acknowledged.&#xD;
The discussions that were had, as to the inalien-&#xD;
ak1~ rights of all men, tended to set this matter in&#xD;
a clearer light than had ever been attained before.&#xD;
Very many persons voluntarily emancipated their&#xD;
slaves - some by direct gift, som~ by will, enjoin-&#xD;
ing it upon their heirs to support comfortably such&#xD;
as should be unable to take care of themselves.&#xD;
Indeed, prior to 1777, such support was made .com-&#xD;
pulsory by law on all who should free their slaves.&#xD;

tory of Ancient Windsor, will show in what esti-&#xD;
m~ition this provision of the law was held by some,&#xD;
at least, of the colored people themselves:&#xD;
An aged and infirm Windsor slave, working in&#xD;
the field with his master, was observed to be very&#xD;
moody and silent. At length l~e broke the silence&#xD;
by saying that such a neighbor had given his slave&#xD;
his freedom, and modestly suggested that "massa&#xD;
ort to gib me my freedom."&#xD;
The master quietly replied,&#xD;
"Well, Tom, yoa may have your freedom."&#xD;
'May I, massa? When?"&#xD;
Now," was the reply.&#xD;
"What! now, massa - right away ? "exclaimed&#xD;
th~ surprised slave.&#xD;
"Yes, Tom; you may stick up Your fork where&#xD;
you are, if you choose, and be free."&#xD;
T~m stood looking upon the ground more mood-&#xD;
ily than ever, while his master went on with his&#xD;
work. After half an hour's consideration, Tom&#xD;
resumed his labor, remarking, with a knowing&#xD;
look, -~&#xD;
"No, massa; you hab de' meat, now you may&#xD;
pick de bone ; me no go and take care old Tom 4&#xD;
myself."&#xD;

&#xD;
in 1777, a law was passed~ authorizing the select-&#xD;
m~n of th~e towns, upon application of any master,&#xD;
to grant liberty of emancipation, without such lia-&#xD;
bility, whenever they were satisfied "that it was&#xD;
likely to be consistent with his (the slave's) real&#xD;
* advantage, and that it was probable he would be&#xD;
able 'to support himself." Under this provision,&#xD;
* very many blacks were emandpated to become&#xD;
soldiers in the army, the selectmen gladly con fer-&#xD;
ring the license, and assuming the risk of the&#xD;
future dependency, for the sake of thus completing&#xD;
the quota of the town, and saving the inhabitants&#xD;
from draft. The surnames of "Freeman," "Free-&#xD;
dom," "Liberty," etc., .which abound in the lists&#xD;
of the soldiers; show to~ what extent thks form of&#xD;
emancipation x~as practiced.&#xD;
In 1784, the year after the war, an act went into&#xD;
effect, declaring that no negro or mulatto child,&#xD;
born in Connecticut subsequent to March i of that&#xD;
year, should be held in servitude after he or she'&#xD;
had attained the* age of twenty-five years. Other~'&#xD;
* laws, frQm timex to time, still further restricted the&#xD;
institution, and ameliorated the condition of ~those&#xD;
held under it, and in 1848 it was abolished alto-&#xD;

Among the negroes that had been brought to&#xD;
Derby from the West Indies was a man named&#xD;
Pero, belonging to Deacon '~{iggs, who lived on&#xD;
the road, called from him "Riggs Street," leading&#xD;
from Derby to Gunntown and Wate bury. Pero&#xD;
was supposed to be a native African; indeed, he&#xD;
used to boast that he was of royal blo9d.&#xD;
"My fader," said he, "was king in his' own&#xD;
country. Tie had plenty of yives, and heap~ bf&#xD;

But this lazy life of indulgence did not last long,&#xD;
and he was soon made to feel what slavery is. J~&#xD;
*    kpow not how he came to be sold, but he had&#xD;
s carcely~ arrived at manhood before he found him-&#xD;
self removed to Connecticut, under the compara-&#xD;
*    tively m~ld ownershk and authority of the good&#xD;
Puritan Deacon i~4gs. In due time, by consent&#xD;
of his master, he took to himself; as a wife, Hagar,&#xD;
a slave of Rev, Dr. Mansfield. By her he had two&#xD;
sons, Tobiah and Laban, ' both noted persons in&#xD;
their day, and perhaps~ other children.&#xD;
*       Tobiah had been purchased by Captaih WoQster,&#xD;
and was, at this time," his man of all work. He&#xD;
was about thirty years old, of a, mahogany rather&#xD;
than sable complexion, and his face scarred by&#xD;
small-pox. He was tall and muscular, lithe of limb&#xD;
and fleet of foot, bearing the palm-of which he was&#xD;
not a little proud for runni leaping, and wres-&#xD;
tling among all the men of t i~egion. He wore&#xD;
in winter an immense fur cap, ade of the skin of&#xD;
a wildcat, which he had catt ht in a~ trap in the&#xD;
woods, the short tail hanging behind his head, and&#xD;
the grinning teeth fastene~i in front as if about to&#xD;
spring upon its prey. 1-us brother Laban is re~&#xD;
membered, also, as having worn a somewhat simi-&#xD;

&#xD;
215&#xD;
&#xD;
lar cap, made of the skin of a loon,-'a large aquatic&#xD;
bird, sometimes caught in this latitude, - which&#xD;
had been dressed .with its feathers on, and was so&#xD;
shaped as to resemble the living bird brooding&#xD;
upon his head. Of these caps the brothers were&#xD;
proud, both as trophies of their skill in hunting&#xD;
and as 'specimens of their taste in the fine arts.&#xD;
A coarse flannel frock, often mended with' parti-&#xD;
colored patches and bound about his waist with a&#xD;
rope's 'end, constituted Tobiah's outer garment,&#xD;
which, if not as gay~ as Joseph's 'coat of many&#xD;
colors, answered at least as good a purpose for&#xD;
wear,~ without subjecting him to the. inconvenience,&#xD;
which the too 'fondly loved son experienced,' of&#xD;
being the object' of envy from those less' fortunate&#xD;
,in their possessions.&#xD;
Captain Wooster was a great hunter, the exten-&#xD;
sive mountainous region bordering upon the~Nau-&#xD;
gatuck Valley, and stretching off to Great Hill and&#xD;
the Housatonic, furnishing a' large variety of game.&#xD;
Wolves, bears, wildcat, deer, anA many smaller&#xD;
animals had once abounded 'there, Indeed, he had&#xD;
enclosed a tract of some hundred acres of land,&#xD;
running up on to the hill west of his house, ~as a&#xD;
deer park, within which he claimed the 'exclusive&#xD;

right to keep and to hunt those animals. It is&#xD;
said that on one side of the inclosure the boun-&#xD;
dary, for some distance,. ~Vas a natural precipice,&#xD;
from which the deer, when pursued by hunters in&#xD;
the adjacent regions, would leap into the fold,&#xD;
where they would be safe. The place, we believe,&#xD;
is still called "The Park."&#xD;
Tobiah's senatorial instincts of course found&#xD;
much to gratify them in this district, and few men&#xD;
caught more foxes, and coons, and rabbits, and&#xD;
squirrels than he. Equally congenial t6 him, like-~&#xD;
wise, were the duties connected with the tavern,&#xD;
the care of horses, waiting upon guests, and the&#xD;
like. He loved to hear the news, to pick up the&#xD;
small gossip and stories in circulation, and after&#xD;
his chores were done, to mingle in the sports of&#xD;
the youngsters, -~ the leaping, and running, and&#xD;
practical jokes, - in which he rarely came off ~ec-&#xD;
ond best. His imperturbable good humor, his&#xD;
strength, and skill, and wit, made him a' general&#xD;
favorite, not only in the neighborhood, but among&#xD;
travelers and others who sought the hospitalities&#xD;
of the inn.&#xD;
But Tobiah, like many another man more re-&#xD;
nowned than he, found his destiny and the crown&#xD;
&#xD;
TOBIAH AND RACHEL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
of his happiness in the smiles of a woman. Rachel,&#xD;
Mrs. Wooster's kitchen drudge, was the daughter&#xD;
of Peter Hull, an aged negro, who had long been&#xD;
in the service of the Wooster's. peter's wife was&#xD;
dead, and he had become decrepitwith years and&#xD;
toil. He lived in a small hut under the hill,&#xD;
a short' distance from th~ captain's, which was&#xD;
reached by a lane crossing the brook in the rear&#xD;
of the tavern. Here Rachel, with filial affection,&#xD;
cared for his comfort, nursed his rheumatism, and&#xD;
did what she could to cheer his lonely days.&#xD;
Rachel was as frolicsome as a kitten, and de-.,&#xD;
lighted in playing off her pranks upon Tobiah.&#xD;
Indeed, it 'might be said that it was by these she&#xD;
won his heart. She would hide his cap, or mittens&#xD;
when he was goi&amp;amp;~ out; she would put chestnut&#xD;
burs into his bed; she would throw her dish-cloth in&#xD;
'his face if he came near her in the kitchen, or spill~&#xD;
the salt in hi~ cup of cider, or drop a~i icicle down&#xD;
his neck, or snatch the chair from behind him as&#xD;
he was about sitting down. When he attempted&#xD;
to catch her for retaliation, she would evade his&#xD;
grasp with the %uppleness of an 'eel, while her&#xD;
rippling laugh an~l merry crow of exultation corn-&#xD;
pleted his discomfiture.&#xD;

At last he could stand it no longer. He vowed&#xD;
he'd '~ be even with dat gal.;" so one day he asked&#xD;
her to be .his, wife.&#xD;
"Yes,'' she cried, "if you 'can. catch me," and,&#xD;
springing through the open door, darted up the*&#xD;
lane leading to her father's...&#xD;
Tobiah was as nimble as she, and set forth gfter&#xD;
hier at his utmost speed. But Rachel had a inn-&#xD;
ute's start of him, and notwithstanding his longer&#xD;
stride,,she reached the cabin, aind shut and fastened&#xD;
the door behind her, before he could overtake her.&#xD;
The echo of her laugh might have been heard half&#xD;
a mile as she appeared at one of the windows, and&#xD;
cried out to him, -&#xD;
"Oh, Toby ! don't yer wish yer could ? Got ter&#xD;
run faster'n dat ter catch dis yer nigger ! Thought&#xD;
'twas an elemphant coming up de lane; oh, rnassy!"'&#xD;
and she went off again in a giggle which seemed&#xD;
to threaten suffocation, and woke old Peter, who&#xD;
was lying on -atattered bed in his bed-room.&#xD;
" Ho, chile ~" he cried; "what's de rnatter wid&#xD;
ye ? S'pects yer in mischief now. Who's'.dat yer&#xD;
a talkin' to ?"&#xD;
Rachel did Alot mind the inquiry, but continued&#xD;
her frolic with her lover. He tried, to open the&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
d&#xD;
&#xD;
door, but finding it fastened, he appeared at the&#xD;
window where she had .defied him, and begged to*&#xD;
be admitted to the house. She refused, and called&#xD;
hirn all sorts of nicknames, then raised the window&#xD;
an inch or two, and as he put his hand underneath,&#xD;
suddenly brought it down again to pinch his fin-&#xD;
gers. At last, wearied with her fun, and perhaps&#xD;
with some 'tender relentings at the vexation she&#xD;
was causing Tobiah, whom in her heart she really&#xD;
liked, she coyly unfastened the door, and opened it&#xD;
a little way, taking care, however, to 'brace herself&#xD;
behind it. But this was of little avail to. stay the&#xD;
impetuous Tobiah, who, with one strong push,&#xD;
burst open the door, and caught her securely 'in&#xD;
his arms.&#xD;
It was a great day at the tavern when Tobiah-~&#xD;
and Rachel were married. - Peter, who had given&#xD;
his ".consent" with tears running down his happy&#xD;
old face, had had a suit of new clothes given by&#xD;
his master ,in honor of the occasion. It had been&#xD;
proposed to the bridegroom that the ceremony&#xD;
should be performed by~ Captain Wooster himself,&#xD;
who was~ a magistrate, and would do it for a less&#xD;
sum than Parson Mansfield,, if he came up from&#xD;
Derby for that purpose. But Tobiah would not&#xD;

listen to this. He was able* to pay, he said, and he&#xD;
was going. to e married just like white folks. For&#xD;
slaves, as I have stated, were allowed to have&#xD;
property, and Tobiah, in the course of years, had&#xD;
laid up quite a little sum of his own. So one&#xD;
Saturday he borrowed the captain's mare, and rode&#xD;
down to the Landing to engage the clergyman for&#xD;
that interesting service.&#xD;
"Wants yer to come up to Cap'n Wooster's 'next&#xD;
Moi~iay night, Massa Parson," he' said; "gwine to&#xD;
be a wedding dar."&#xD;
"A wedding, Toby?"&#xD;
"Yes, massa ; and 'here's de publis'ment and de&#xD;
barns; you'll read 'em in de church to-morrow?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes; I'll publish the banns ~ but who is it,&#xD;

"Me, parson, and Rachel. Wants yer, ter come&#xD;
shuah. Bring yer book wid yer; and marry us just&#xD;
as you do white folks. What d'ye a~, Massa Mans-&#xD;
field, for marryin'?"&#xD;
"Well, Tobiah, white folks usually, give me about&#xD;
six shillings," said the doctor, highly amused,&#xD;
"sometimes more, and if y u are going to be&#xD;
married just as they are, it wil be right that you'&#xD;
should pay the same fee w '~' it?"&#xD;

The " barns " were published according to law,&#xD;
and on the appointed e vehing, the good parson&#xD;
presented dihimself in. Captain Wooster's kitchen&#xD;
for the performance of his official duty. Her mis-&#xD;
tress had given Rachel a white dress which had&#xD;
belonged to Miss Ruth, and if there was any lack&#xD;
of diamonds, it was fully compensated by the, spar-&#xD;
kie of the laughing black eyes, which could not be&#xD;
soberyeven in a time of so much importance as "this.&#xD;
Tobiah was -gorgeous in crimson ~small-clothes and&#xD;
white stockings, while his woolly head, powdered&#xD;
after'the fashion of the times, towered a foot above&#xD;
the red and yellow handkerchief which did duty'as&#xD;
a turban by his side.&#xD;
The ceremonies were completed, the festivities&#xD;
of the occasion were over, and the clergymarn was&#xD;
about to depart. Topiab had apparently forgoten&#xD;
the promise which he had made; when the latter&#xD;
jocosely reminded him of it.&#xD;
" Come, Tobiah ; you remember the bargain : I&#xD;

had better leave th~ matter as it was, unless he&#xD;
was prc~pared to meet fully 1?6biah's' expectations.&#xD;

he storm showed no signs of abat&amp;amp;&#xD;
ent. The wind blew as only' March&#xD;
winds can blow, piling the fleecy masses in drifts,&#xD;
and rendering the roads nearly impassable.&#xD;
Tobiah was up very early in the morning, to start&#xD;
the fires at the tavern and attend to his numerous&#xD;
chores. He was engaged in this manner in the&#xD;
kitchen, and restoi~ing to order the furniture, which&#xD;
showed signs of a late occupancy the night before,&#xD;
when th~ chamber door opened, and two m~n with&#xD;
packs already slung upon their backs, and with&#xD;
guns~ in their hands, came down. They were at&#xD;
first startled at seeing.~.4he negro, but perceiving&#xD;
th4 he was ~ servant of the family, concluded that ~'&#xD;
they were in no danger of betrayal by hin~\ and&#xD;

passed through the hall into the, bar-room. Pres-&#xD;
ently one of them, Graham, returned, and began&#xD;
to, l6ok carefully around the room, under the table&#xD;
and benches, which served instead of chairs, as if&#xD;
searching for something.&#xD;
"Los' anything, massa?" Tobiah inquired.&#xD;
"I'm afraid so," was the reply. "Something's&#xD;
gone out of my pack this morning, which I know I&#xD;
had yesterday. We put down our bundles in the&#xD;
cor er. there, last night, while we ate supper, and I&#xD;
likely it dropped out when we took them&#xD;
"What was it, sar?" s id Tobiah; and he drew&#xD;
up to, go to bed."&#xD;
near with his candle, to as ist in the search; for the&#xD;
room was still quite dark in the thick gloom, after&#xD;
the stormy morning.&#xD;
"Ah, here it is !" exclaimed the other, snatching&#xD;
something fron~ the floor, and hastily thrusting it&#xD;
into ~his pocket. Rapid as was the motion, the&#xD;
quick eyes of the negr~ detected what he took to&#xD;
be a pistol. Graham made no fiwther reply to the&#xD;
question, but returned immediately to . the bar-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
The sight. of the pistol, with the general * appear-&#xD;
ance~f the strangers, awakened suspicions in the&#xD;

mind of Tobiah. He had h4rd, the ,day before,&#xD;
*   that a search was going on for somebody accused&#xD;
of robbery, and it instantly occurred to him~ that&#xD;
*   these might be the- persons. The arms they car~&#xD;
ned, together with thek bundles, the distrustful&#xD;
* look they gave him as they came down, all. tended&#xD;
t~ confirm his suspicions. He resolved, however,&#xD;
to say nothing about it at present, but to watch&#xD;
them very carefully.&#xD;
Presently Captain Wooster came out from his&#xD;
~apartment, and passed also into the bar-room.&#xD;
Tobiah had been there before he came into the.&#xD;
kitchen, and a brisk fire was a1read~r blazing in the&#xD;
*   chimney.&#xD;
The landlord had not met his guests the night&#xD;
before, but he needed no formal introduction. Doo~&#xD;
little was slightly known to him, being a relative of&#xD;
* I~ is brother David's family. The morning saluta..&#xD;
t ons were exchanged, and the customary transac-&#xD;
4 on at the bar engaged in by the strangers wilh&#xD;
ore than usual relish. A~ brief conversation f&amp;amp;I-&#xD;
lowed as to the events of the clay previous, and&#xD;
t~e prospect of their being, able tq get away that&#xD;
day. They inquired where they might find? their&#xD;
companions, and were manifestly eager to leav&amp;amp;'the&#xD;

house as ~oon as possible, feeling that they were in&#xD;
danger there. Mr.. Wo~ster went with them down&#xD;
to the ho~se~shed, and pointing to a large barn ata&#xD;
considerable distance in the meadow, bade them&#xD;
all keep quiet there dl4ing the day. Some men&#xD;
would probably come there, he said, with their oxen&#xD;
*      and sled for a load of hay, which fact, if they kept&#xD;
carefully out of sight, would tend to increase their&#xD;
safety rather than otherwise, since no one wo~~ld&#xD;
think of suspecting their presence in a place thus&#xD;
occupied. Thus advised, the two men sprang ov~r&#xD;
the fence, and speedily joined their 'comrades in&#xD;
the barn.&#xD;
That day was gloomy in the extreme to the fugi~&#xD;
tives. They had intended to start with the 'first&#xD;
dawn of light, and thread their way over the hills&#xD;
and through. the woods 'to Derby Landing, ther~ to&#xD;
embark at night for Long Island. The severity.of&#xD;
the weather, however, made them shrink from the&#xD;
exposure and fatigue. They were witho~tt boots or&#xD;
overcoats, both 'of which were articles not in common&#xD;
use in those days. A homespun flannel shirt and&#xD;
coarse woolen stockings sufficed for warmth, or if&#xD;
more were needed, it must be. gained' by Vigorous&#xD;
wor1~ or other exercise. The bottoms of the tron-&#xD;

&#xD;
sers were tjed about the ankles with strings, and&#xD;
sometimes an old stocking drawn over them, mak-&#xD;
ing a rude sort of legging. These, at best, were&#xD;
but a "poor preparation for wading in the deep'&#xD;
snow.&#xD;
The barn was open and bre~zy. The boards with&#xD;
which it was covered had shrunk so that one's fin-&#xD;
gers might be thrust between them, while the ill-&#xD;
fitting and broken doors gave free access both to&#xD;
light, and storm. New England farmers had not&#xD;
earned then, - as too many, it is to be feared, have&#xD;
not learned yet, that warmth is~ as necessary to&#xD;
the thrift of their animals as food, and that close&#xD;
and comfortable stables save n~any a ton, of hay in&#xD;
the winter.&#xD;
The entrance of Graham and Doolittle 'roused&#xD;
the sleepers in the hay ; but after reconnoitering the&#xD;
viex~r outside, ar~d receiving the message sent them&#xD;
from their host, they concluded to remain where&#xD;
they were until the storm should abate. Desig~&#xD;
eating one of their number to act as sentinel, and&#xD;
give notice if anyone approached, they crept anew'&#xD;
beneath their fragrant covering, and tried to~ go&#xD;
'I&#xD;
to sleep again. But the spell was broken and to&#xD;
some, at least, sleep was impossible. The' stern&#xD;

&#xD;
realities of their condition pressed t~pon'their&#xD;
thoughts, and awo~e too deep an anxiety to permit&#xD;
/&#xD;
them to slumber a~y longer.&#xD;
Such was especially the case with our young&#xD;
friend Chauncey. Under the excitement and fa-&#xD;
tigue of the preceding day, he had slept soundly&#xD;
through the night, oblivious alike of the past and&#xD;
the future. But with th'e return of consciousness&#xD;
dawned anew the realization of his peril. Never&#xD;
do the facts of our experience come to us with s~&#xD;
vivid an impressior(as when we wake to them from&#xD;
the depths of a dreamless sleep. As they recur to&#xD;
us one by one, they thrill along our -nerves like sue-&#xD;
cessive electric discharges, n~aking them seem, if&#xD;
possible, more real than at the moment of their ac-&#xD;
tu al experience.&#xD;
So it~was with the young man. H~ was a ~pris-&#xD;
oner. He was in the power of those who would&#xD;
not shrink at any' moment to "murder him. He was&#xD;
being hLrried away, he knew not whither, t6 some&#xD;
dark destination; from which the chances were&#xD;
that he would never return. Then came, too, the.&#xD;
remembrance of th9 sweet divine peace which h a~i&#xD;
been granted him in his agony by the side of th&#xD;
old well iti the cellar. He was in the hands of hi&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
heavenly Father stil~1 ; ~of him who had twice in-&#xD;
terposed to save his life, and who in that hour of&#xD;
mortal terror had revealed himself to him as an&#xD;
unseen but loving Friend.&#xD;
The thought was like a benediction to his over-&#xD;
burdened heart. Silently he poured out the ex-&#xD;
pression of his thankfulness and trust. He en-&#xD;
treated the Go~ who had made himself known to&#xD;
him, the God of Joseph and Daniel, to save him&#xD;
from bondage and restore him to his home. He&#xD;
prayed for all the inmates of that home, especially&#xD;
the ever dear father and mother, who, he knew,&#xD;
.must be in deep grief on his account. Nay, he&#xD;
prayed for his captors themselves, that 'they might&#xD;
be induced to release him; and more, fhatj they&#xD;
might be caused to see the sinfulness of their ways&#xD;
and be brought to repentance and a better life. In&#xD;
the earnestness of his feeling he forgot for the mo~&#xD;
ment where he was,; the words, which at first were&#xD;
little more ~than whispered sighs, became audibJbe~.&#xD;
and his eyes streamed with tears.&#xD;
The deep emotion of Chauncey awoke some&#xD;
sympathetic feeling in the mind of David Wooster,&#xD;
by whose side he was. lying, a little apart from the&#xD;
rest. Partly out of ' pity,' and partly out of curiosity&#xD;

saw nor heard him, and nobody living ever did. For&#xD;
my part, I believe it's all a humbug."&#xD;
"But 'the Bible says there is," pleaded Chauncey,&#xD;
" and it says, 'too, that he does hear an4 answer&#xD;
prayer.'&#xD;
"Oh, the Bible says so !" sneered David.; " that's&#xD;
enough, I suppose. But what's the Bible, I'd like&#xD;

" Well, for one thing. I believe God heard my&#xD;

will go with me through all that is before me. I&#xD;

Watds noon, a team and sled with its broad rigging&#xD;
were seen coming from the road into the meadow,&#xD;
and approaching. the. barn. Mr. Daniel Wooster&#xD;
had sold a quantity ~f hay stored 'there to, a Mr.&#xD;
Hazleton, one of his r~ neighbors, and the necessities&#xD;
of the la~t~~equired ~hat~ it should be taken away.&#xD;
at once without waiting for a better day. At first,&#xD;
Captain Wooster had engaged to do the work of re-&#xD;
* moving it, but this morning, fearing to disturb the&#xD;
secrecy of his nephews and their companions, and&#xD;
possibly foreseeing some legal hazard from putting&#xD;
himself into a position where he could not help&#xD;
having a knowledge of their, concealment, he had&#xD;
excused himself to Mr. Hazletoneor~ the plea that&#xD;
his sled was broken, off to do .the. work the&#xD;
next day. Mr. ilazieton, however, could not wait,&#xD;
and procured another man to do it instead.&#xD;
Warned by Captain Wooster that such a visit&#xD;
might be made to the barn, the fugitives were al-&#xD;
ready prepared for it. The hay would be taken&#xD;
from the large mow in the main bay,(and they sup-&#xD;
posed there was little probability that the othe~&#xD;
parts of the barn would be disturbed. On the op/&#xD;
posited side was a loft above the stables, which&#xD;
filled with rye straw, the remains of the suInmei~&#xD;
&#xD;
BOOSTER'S BARN.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
harvesting which the month before had been&#xD;
thrashed out. Upon and behind this they had&#xD;
made spaces between the bundles where they might&#xD;
stow themselves, the open cracks in the boarding&#xD;
affording them plenty of air for breathing. Here&#xD;
they hoped to lie undiscovered during the brief&#xD;
time requisite for loading the hay. At the same&#xD;
time they had agreed that, if detected, they would&#xD;
seize upon the men in charge of the team and hold&#xD;
them in custody till night, when they mi~ht make,&#xD;
their escape.&#xD;
The teamsmen, reached the barn and began their&#xD;
work. Having cleared the floor of littler, they first&#xD;
prepared their apparatus for weighing the hay.&#xD;
Mr. Hazleton ascended the stable loft and crept&#xD;
over the pile of straw to a scaffolding which rested&#xD;
on the great beams, to one of the timbers of which&#xD;
he attached a rope. This hanging directly over the&#xD;
floor, served to suspend the big steelyard to which&#xD;
the hay was slung in successive bundles for weigh~&#xD;
ing. It was an anxious moment for those lying be~&#xD;
neath the straw, as they felt the weight of the man&#xD;
passing along over them ; but they lay profoundly&#xD;
still, and fortunately escaped detection.&#xD;
'The men worked with a will, for it was very cold~&#xD;

xA portion of. the rope was laid in two parallel&#xD;
lengths upon the floor, upon which the hay was&#xD;
thrown from the mow. ~ALhen as much was thus&#xD;
piled ~is the rote would compass, the, loose ends&#xD;
were gathered and passed through the bight, 'mak-&#xD;
ing a. slip-noose around the mass, then being lifted.&#xD;
to the steelyard, its Weight was speedily ascer-&#xD;
tained, and marked wfrh a bit of chalk upon one,&#xD;
of the boards of the barn. It was laborious work,"&#xD;
and the men 'had little time or inclination for&#xD;
talking.&#xD;
At length, in a brief-pause in which they in-&#xD;
dulged for resting, Jiazieton remarked that~ he&#xD;
thought it singular that Captain Wooster's sled&#xD;
should have been broken so soon, for it was a new&#xD;
one, and had never been used before that winter.&#xD;
"The. I think of it," said he, "the more I&#xD;
believe it was all an excuse 'to get rid of the job.&#xD;
He had his old sled, even if the new one was broke.&#xD;
I don't believe he wanted to come out to-day. T&#xD;
wonder if he don't know something about this rob-&#xD;
bery that's' making ~o much noise. 'They say the&#xD;

was took last night and put under keepers for har~&#xD;

"Mebbe so," said his companion, "but where do&#xD;
you s~pose the rogues be now?"&#xD;
"I~don't know. They haven't been caught yet,&#xD;
but they' ~will be, you may depend, for the whole&#xD;
'region is arter them. The fellows are lurking&#xD;
around somewhere, and I shouldn't a bit wonder if&#xD;
the captain knows where."&#xD;
"Nor I either," said the other; "but we mustn't&#xD;
stand here talking. ~The day 'is short, and we've&#xD;
got to pitch in."&#xD;
So saying, he suited the action to the word, and&#xD;
plunged his fork into a heavy mass of hay. Just&#xD;
then, owing probably to the dust arising from the&#xD;
work, which penetrated every part of the barn, a&#xD;
suppressed sneeze was heard.&#xD;
"Hush!" cried Hazieton; "what was that? I&#xD;
should' almost think there was~ somebody hid here&#xD;
in the barn: Didn't you hear.it,? a kind of sneeze,&#xD;
or something!"&#xD;
"Pshaw, no!" replied the laborer. "Where can&#xD;
any body be hid here.? Besides, you know there'&#xD;
wa' n't' any tracks in the snow, and nobody could&#xD;
get here without leaving his mark.~ Hand,' up th&amp;amp;&#xD;

if he found it s.afe,' he was to appear at the rear&#xD;
~of the house, fro~ri whence the barn was in view,&#xD;
and swing his ~hat as a, signal. His gun should&#xD;
be left behind, but 'in place of it, he should take&#xD;
Gr~ham's pistol, both for se~f-defense. and to give&#xD;
~the alarm. if there was, serio~i s danger.&#xD;
ng that dab, intelligent e had been received&#xD;
captain 'Wooster and his family which greatly~&#xD;
alarmed them., Mr. Henry Wooster, father of&#xD;
'Henry Wooster, Jr., with another gentleman, had&#xD;
been there inquiring after his son. He brought&#xD;
the news, already mentioned in the conversation&#xD;
of Mr. H~zleton at the barn, that David Wooster,&#xD;
Sen., had been arrested the previous evening, and&#xD;
had confessed 'that his son and Henry were among&#xD;
the robbers; also that he was then in close custQdy&#xD;
of keepers, under. the appointment of a magistrate.&#xD;
Henry's father was ii great anxiety. for his son,&#xD;
and begged his brother, if he should come thei~e,&#xD;
or if he to him, to send him home&#xD;
could get word&#xD;
at once. This the captain promised to do.&#xD;
When, therefore, Henry came up from the barn,&#xD;
his uncle informed him of what he had heard,, and&#xD;
advised him most urgently to flee. 1-Ic told l~i~~&#xD;
&#xD;
that all Derby, no le s than Judd's Meadow and&#xD;
Gunntown, were aroused and engaged in the, se5ch&#xD;
for them. There was no possibility of the party,&#xD;
as a whole, escaping. Guards were stationed upon&#xD;
all the roads and at every bridge, and there was no&#xD;
chance for any of them but in dispersing,, and each&#xD;
looking out for himself the best way he could.&#xD;
Neither was th~re any time to be lost; the pur-&#xD;
suers might be there at any moment. Just then&#xD;
the way was clear, and if he seized the opportunity,&#xD;
he might get off safely, 'but if he waited a single&#xD;
minute, he did it at his peril.&#xD;
* Th~ young man was not a little alarmed. He&#xD;
knew that, if apprehended and brought 'to trial, he&#xD;
could not hope to escape a heavy punish roent. The&#xD;
evident anxiety of his uncle moved him, and he saw&#xD;
the situation in which both himself and his com~&#xD;
rades stood more clearly than he had ever done&#xD;
before,&#xD;
"l3ut, uncle," he exclaimed, "1 cannot leave the&#xD;
fellows now. They have trusted me to come up&#xD;
here, and get them someth~ng~to eat, and I can't&#xD;
r&#xD;
turn traitor to them."&#xD;
"Neither can you help them by staying. It&#xD;
'won't be twelve hours l~fore you will all be, caught,&#xD;

" May be not, but' it would be, mean to leave&#xD;
them at such a time. Besides, we are all nearly&#xD;
starved -haven't had a mouthful to eat to\-day.&#xD;
Will you let Toby get them something, if I do as&#xD;
you wish ?"&#xD;
"I don't care what is done if I am not made&#xD;
responsible for it. He may make a fire in the. cel-&#xD;
lar, and by and by, after dark, they may come and&#xD;
warm, but neither I nor your aunt must know any-&#xD;
thing about it. We have 'done enough already to&#xD;
make 'it dangerous for us if we sh'ouldl be found&#xD;
out."&#xD;
The arguments and entreaties of Captain Woos-&#xD;
ter at length prevailed. Henry went out into the&#xD;
wood-shed, in the rear of the house, where the&#xD;
negro was busy choppi pg and piling wood.&#xD;
" Tobiah," he said, "d you want to help a fellow'&#xD;
when he is in trouble?"&#xD;
"I' does that, Massa enry," he replied. " Tell'&#xD;

'Can you keep it secret too ?.&#xD;
"Can I?. Takes dis child just to do dat. What&#xD;

"Yes, sar ; I tinks so 'too. I'se heerd your fader&#xD;

" Han't got no gun," said the negro. "Gib me&#xD;

and -now, very unexpectedly, the means were placed&#xD;
in his power. He did not know how many there&#xD;
~were of the party, but he had seen two of them in-'&#xD;

that Henry and David were among them..&#xD;

" Wonder if de buckshot I went gunnin' wid&#xD;

or three, and placed them in the pistol barrel with&#xD;
a grimace .of delight, then, picking up a small twig&#xD;
lying at his feet, crowded these down upon the&#xD;
charge.&#xD;
" Good fit, Massa . Henry !." he' cried. Then;&#xD;
straightening himself up to his full highit, and at&#xD;
the same time cocking the. pistol, he brought it&#xD;
close to the young man's ear, and said,-&#xD;
" No, sir ; you no leave here dis night. I knows&#xD;

The commanding figure of the African, his flash-&#xD;
ing eyes and resolute tones, overawed the young&#xD;
man. He saw that he had placed himself in the&#xD;
negro's power, and that the latter was in no mood&#xD;
to be trifled with. Stifling his wrath for the&#xD;
* moment, he turned and walked ir~to the kitchen&#xD;
as directed, not doubting that his trncle would in-&#xD;
ter~ose at once. But he fou~d himself mistaken&#xD;
in this expectation. To rescue him from Tobiah&#xD;
* would expose himself~ to the charge~ of being an&#xD;
accomplice in their crime, an he hastened away&#xD;
to the bar-room, leaving the two in the kitchen.&#xD;
"Rachel," said Tobiah to his wife, who was at&#xD;
work at the sink, "go tell your fader to come here&#xD;
quick."&#xD;
Rachel sped away, and presently returned with&#xD;
old Peter, who came as fast as his' rheumaticz"&#xD;
would allow.&#xD;
"Wants yer to help take care 6f dis boy," said&#xD;
Tobiah. "Bring your clothes line, Rachel."&#xD;
The order was obeyed, the pistol all this while&#xD;
being held in suggestive proximity to the head of&#xD;
the young man. 'The latter was now thoroughly&#xD;
alarmec~, as well as exasperated. Finding that&#xD;
curses and threats were unavailing, he tried expos-&#xD;
&#xD;
tulation, and even entreaty, but with as little efl~ct.&#xD;
His captors were immovable. With the aid of&#xD;
Peter, Henry's arms were securely bound behind&#xD;
him, and then the old man was dispatched to give&#xD;

tion in dispute, on which side to bestow his :sym-.&#xD;

The same thing was true', as a general rule,&#xD;
with the colored, people throughout the colonies.&#xD;
Though slavery existed under the colonial laws,&#xD;
yet it was of a far milder type than that which was&#xD;
maintained in the West Indies. The slave trade&#xD;
was carried on in English ships, and upder the&#xD;
authority and patronage of ,the British crown.&#xD;
When the colonies had attempted to abolish the&#xD;
infamous traffic, their enactments were overruled&#xD;
and annulled by. the acts of Parliament. It was&#xD;
one of the most stinging charges hurled against&#xD;
King Geor-ge III., in the first draft of the Declara-&#xD;
tion of Independence, that he had thus protected&#xD;
the slave trade ; and though the paragraph was&#xD;
finally stricken out of that immortal document be-&#xD;
fore it was adopted, yet everybody knew it was&#xD;
true. Said Jefferson, its author, -&#xD;
" For. the most trifling reasons, and sometimes&#xD;
for no conceivable* reason at all, his majesty had&#xD;
rejected laws of the most salutary tendency. The&#xD;
abolition of domestic slavery is the great subject&#xD;
of desire in those colonies, where it- was, unhappily,&#xD;

the enfranchisextrnnt of the slaves we have,' it is&#xD;
necessary to exclude all further importation from&#xD;
Africa. Yet our' repeated attempts to effe t this~&#xD;
'by prohibitions, and by, imposing duties which&#xD;
might amount to a prohibition, have been hitherto~&#xD;
defeated by his majesty's negative; thus preferring&#xD;
tl~ie immediate advantages of a few British corsairs&#xD;
to the lasting interests of the~American states, and&#xD;
to the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by&#xD;
'this infamous practice." 1&#xD;
Not only, therefore, on general grounds of politi-&#xD;
cal right, but also as specially connected with' the&#xD;
condition of their 'Own race, were the colored people&#xD;
of that day friends to tl~ie cause ,of independence.&#xD;
The very leader of the mob that assailed the Brit-&#xD;
ish troops at the time of the famous Boston Massa-&#xD;
cre, and the first that was shot down' by them, was&#xD;
Crispus Attucks, who, twenty years before, had&#xD;
been advertised in the Boston, Gazette as a runa-&#xD;
way slave, with a reward of ten pou~ids offered for&#xD;
his return to his master. At the battle of' Bunker&#xD;
Hill, one of the most memorable events was the&#xD;
shooting of Major Pit~airn, of the British army, by&#xD;
Jefferson's Works, vol. i. p. 135.&#xD;
&#xD;
the colored soldi'~r, Peter Salem, a fact appropri-&#xD;
ately commemorated by Colonel Trumbull in his&#xD;
celebrated painting of that battle.&#xD;
"The major," said an eye-witness of the affair,&#xD;
"had passed the storm of our fire~without, and had&#xD;
mounted the redoubt, when, waving his sword, he'&#xD;
commanded, in a loud voice, the 'rebels' to surren-&#xD;
der. Uis sudden appearance and his commanding&#xD;
air at first startled the men immediately before&#xD;
him. They neither answered nor fired, probably&#xD;
not being exactly certain what was next to 'be&#xD;
done. At this critical moment, a negro soldier&#xD;
stepped forward, and aiming his musket directl'yx~at&#xD;
the major's bosom, blew him through."'&#xD;
Another event in. which a negro bore aconspic-&#xD;
uous part was the capture of the British General&#xD;
Prescott, at Newport, in '1777. "The exploit,"&#xD;
says Livermore, "was much commended at the&#xD;
time, as its results were highly important, and&#xD;
Colonel Barton very properly~ received from Con-&#xD;
gress {he compliment of a sword for ingenuity&#xD;
and bravery. It seems, however, that it took more&#xD;
dian one head to execute ~he undertaking.&#xD;

"They landed about fi 6' miles from Newport,&#xD;
and three quarters of a mi e from the house, which&#xD;
they approached cautiously, avoiding the' main&#xD;
guard, which was at some distance. The colonel&#xD;
went foremost, with a stout, active negro close&#xD;
behind him, and another at a small distance; the&#xD;
rest followed so as to be near, but not s~en.&#xD;
"A single sentinel at the door saw and hailed&#xD;
the colonel; he answered by exclaiming against,&#xD;
and inquiring for, rebel prisoners, but kept slowly&#xD;
advancing.. The sentinel again .challenged him,&#xD;
and required the countersign. He said he had not&#xD;
the countersign, but amused the sentry by talking&#xD;
about rebel prisoners, and still 'advancing fill he&#xD;
came within reach of the bayonet, which, he pre-&#xD;
senting, the colonel, suddenly struck aside, and&#xD;
seized him. He was immediately secured, and&#xD;
ordered to be silent on pain of death. Meanwhile,&#xD;
the rest of the men surrounding the house, the&#xD;
negro, with his head, ~t the second stroke, forced a&#xD;
passage into it, and then into the landlord's apart-&#xD;
ment. The landlord at first refused' to give the&#xD;
necessary intelligence, but on the prospect of pres-&#xD;

These events, and many others in which colored&#xD;
men, showed their bravery and fidelity to the cause&#xD;
of the colonies, were much talked of, at the time,&#xD;
throughout the country, and T iah was very proud&#xD;
~ f them. The battle of Bunker Hill particularly&#xD;
excited his most intense enthusiasm. Though it&#xD;
as apl)arently a defeat' for the patriot troops, yet&#xD;
in its effects inspiring courage and hope-it&#xD;
was equivalent to a victory. That the raw Yankee&#xD;
troops should dare~ to meet tl~e veteran soldiers of&#xD;
Britain, - the veritable red-coats, - should stand&#xD;
their fire and return it with such deadly 'effect, and,&#xD;
but for the failure of their ammunition, should have&#xD;
had the certainty of victory, was too much almost&#xD;
for belief. Tobiah loved to repeat the story, with&#xD;
such embellishments as his own fervid imagination&#xD;
suggested. Especially did. he' never omit to men-&#xD;
tion the brave deed of Peter Salem.&#xD;

Golly! don't I wish I'd been dere to see it!"&#xD;
Tobiah's patriotism at last won for him the boon&#xD;
which, more than all things else, he craved his&#xD;
freedom. I have before spoken of the law which&#xD;
authorized the towns to permit the emancipation&#xD;
of slaves on condition of their enlistment into the&#xD;
army. In pursuance of this law, we find, in 'the&#xD;
records of Derby, that at a town meeting, held&#xD;
January 8, 1781, it was "voted that the authority&#xD;
and selectmen be empowered and directed to give&#xD;
certificates to Captain Daniel Holbrook and Cap-&#xD;
tain John Wooster to free and emancipate their&#xD;
servants, negro men, on the condition that the&#xD;
said negro men enlist into the state regiment, to be&#xD;
raised for the defense of this state, for the term of&#xD;
one year." I~tis not known whether Tobiah con-&#xD;
tinued in ~the service longer th~in the term speci~&#xD;
fled, but a~ the war was now drawing to a close,&#xD;
the presumption is, that he did notL ~Still he had&#xD;
&#xD;
served long enough to win his, own liberty, and&#xD;
enroll .his humble name in the' list of those brave&#xD;
men, who, by their heroic endurance as well as,&#xD;
active efforts, achieved, with the divine blessing,,&#xD;
the liberty of their country.&#xD;
From a considerable period before the Revolu-&#xD;
tion there has prevailed among the negroes a sin-&#xD;
gular custom, which may not improperly1 be men~&#xD;
tiqned here. It is that of choosing annually, from&#xD;
among themselves, a governor of Connecticut.&#xD;
"Election Day," so called, not because the gov-&#xD;
ernor and other officials are then voted for by the&#xD;
people, but because the result of their choice fs&#xD;
then declared, and th~e persons chosen inducted&#xD;
into office, thi~ ma king the election complete, has&#xD;
always been a political holiday in this state. For-&#xD;
merly it ~was celebrated with more eclat than at&#xD;
present. The' military paraded, gentlemen of dis-&#xD;
clergymen&#xD;
tinction  magistrates, lawyers,           and&#xD;
others marched in procession to attend divine&#xD;
service, and hear the election sermon, after -which&#xD;
a sumptuous dinner was partaken of, and other&#xD;
festivities continued through the day and evening&#xD;
All over the state similar rejoicing were indulged&#xD;
in, and that family must be very poor in purse and&#xD;

patriotism who had not 'at least their "election&#xD;
cake."&#xD;
Such a day, of course, would be one of high&#xD;
account among the colored people. Those who&#xD;
lived within any moderate distance of the capital&#xD;
were sure to be there, arrayed in their very best.&#xD;
~Not a few, from the more distant parts, came also&#xD;
as sei~vants in attendance upon their masters. It'&#xD;
followed, therefore, that the colored People of the&#xD;
~tate were well represented on these occasions,&#xD;
and in imitation of their superiors, they, too, elected&#xD;
*r1&#xD;
a governor, whO ~was ujnnormly treated with g eat&#xD;
attention, and always adc~ressed by that title.&#xD;
At the election in May, I 776, Governor C if,&#xD;
who had held' his office ten years, resigned, and a&#xD;
successor was appointed. This event was formally&#xD;
announced to the public in the following proclama-&#xD;

It will hardly be believed that this farcical affair&#xD;
awakened great alarm among the white authorities.&#xD;
The Governor Skene whose servant succeeded to&#xD;
the sable gubernatorial dignity was a tory who had&#xD;
been in command of the forts at Ticonderoga and&#xD;
Crown Point at the time of their capture by Cob&#xD;
onel Ethan Allen, and was now a prisoner on&#xD;
parole a~. Hartford. It was feared that this choice&#xD;

of his servant had been instigated by him with the&#xD;
design of bringing the negroes of the colony under&#xD;
the -in fluency of the tory party. It was a critical&#xD;
time in public affairs, and the' people were jealous&#xD;
and alarmed at the rustling of every leaf. Skene&#xD;
denied having had anything to do with the 4ppdint-&#xD;
ment, and after a rigid examination of both 'him&#xD;
and the blacks, it was concluded that there was no&#xD;
cause for' alarm. Still,.there. was so much appre-&#xD;
hension of possible evil* that neither the new gov-&#xD;
ernor nor any of -the suspected tory negroes were&#xD;
permitted to pay anythirig for the expenses of the&#xD;
election. A dance and entertainment were held at&#xD;
the tavern at a cost of fifty shillings, which was&#xD;
paid. by Majors French and Dermet.&#xD;
In consequence, doubtless, of the impossibility&#xD;
of assembling from all parts of the state at the&#xD;
capital, the practice of choosing a governor for the&#xD;
whole commonwealth gradually ceased, and differ-&#xD;
ent localities chose each such a dignitary for'itself.&#xD;
In Derby andl the vicinity, this has continued to&#xD;
the, present time. Tobiah was early elevated .to&#xD;
this high office, and bore its honors and responsi-&#xD;

bilities with all becoming dignity. Of late years,&#xD;
we are informed, the election has generally been&#xD;
bestowed by rotation. .The occasion is celebrated&#xD;
by a military parade, a procession,. horseback and&#xD;
on foot, and music, ending with a supper and dan-&#xD;
cing. Arid though those engaged in it have been&#xD;
often laughed at* by their' more. fortunate fellow-&#xD;
citizens of a lighter hue, it may at least .be truly&#xD;
said that thie day has rarely been disgraced' by&#xD;
fighting or drunkenness. While never a St. Pat-&#xD;
rick's Day nor a Fourth of July passes' without&#xD;
'broken .heads and bloody noses, the blacks, who&#xD;
have been despised as inferior to Saxon and Celt,&#xD;
have enjoyed their harmless fun without disturbing&#xD;
the peace,s or sending new recruits to the alms--&#xD;

CHAP ER XXIV.&#xD;
RESCUE AND FLIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE robbers, who had been waiting for&#xD;
Henry in Wooster's barN, became impa-&#xD;
tient at his failure to give the signal&#xD;
which had been agreed. upon. It was already grow-&#xD;
ing dark, and they were getting exhausted with&#xD;
their hunger and cold. As the storm abated there&#xD;
was more passing in the street, and several persons&#xD;
were seen on horseback,. who~, they suspected,&#xD;
might be engaged in the search for themselves.&#xD;
At last the suspense became too great to be borne.&#xD;
was evident either that Henry had proved false&#xD;
to. them, or had been himself arrested, without an&#xD;
opportunity of giving them the signal by dischar-&#xD;
ging his pistol. They determined therefore to wait&#xD;
no longer. As soon as it was dark enough to give&#xD;
* them some feeling of safety, they slung their packs&#xD;
258&#xD;
&#xD;
upon their shoulders, and seizing their muskets&#xD;
and halberds, made directl)T for Captain Wooster's&#xD;
house. Approaching it in the rear, they examined.&#xD;
the kitchen through the window, and finding no-&#xD;
body there but the negroes and one whom. they&#xD;
took to be their missing comrade, they opened the&#xD;
door and walked in.&#xD;
Their arrival, it may be believed, was most wel-&#xD;
come to the prisQner. In a word he had told them&#xD;
what had happened, and was as speedily released&#xD;
from his bonds. Tobiah afforded them no chance&#xD;
to retaliate for the indignity, for he had departed,&#xD;
the moment they appeared, to call help. . Mrs.&#xD;
Wooster, hearing the noise in the kitchen, came in,&#xD;
and forgetting the prudential considerations up6ii&#xD;
which she had before acted, counseled the party to&#xD;
flee forthwith. "It will be but a few minutes," she&#xD;
said~ ~' before the negroes will bring men here to&#xD;
take you. Get away as quick as you can; but&#xD;
don't go by the road. Every corner has a man&#xD;

awakened. Famishing as they ivere, they felt that&#xD;
they must not delay a moment. The cider pitcher&#xD;
stood* on the table ngar them, and one of them&#xD;
seized this ~ind, drained it of its contents. Then&#xD;
opening the door, without staying even to say good&#xD;
night, they crossed the brook and laid their course&#xD;
through the Pelds in a circuitousroute by the way&#xD;
of Great Hill, for the Landing and the Island.&#xD;
Scarcely had they got, out of sight before Tobiah&#xD;
and Peter returned with several persons whom they&#xD;
had chanced to meet that were already out in pur-&#xD;
suit of the criminals. Foremost among these was&#xD;
Captain Bradford Steele, one of the most promi.-&#xD;
nent citizens of the town, and' a zealous patriot.&#xD;
He learned from the negroes the particulars of the&#xD;
arrest and rescue of' Henry Wooster, and the advice&#xD;
their mistress had given them as to their flight.&#xD;
Others presently came in, and after a brief, consul-&#xD;
tation; it was resolved to set forth in pursuIt, gath-&#xD;
ering by the way as many as possible to joiA them.&#xD;
The race was now fairly begun. The robbers&#xD;
had the advantage of a few ihinutes' start of' their&#xD;
pursuers, but the latter were, many of them, mount-&#xD;
ed on horseback and able to outstrip the fugitives&#xD;
in speed. The snow was in many places badly&#xD;
&#xD;
drifted, as it is apt to be .in March, ancL the 'clouds,&#xD;
still lingering after the storm, covered the sky with&#xD;
a paIl of gloom. This, however, was~ welcomed by&#xD;
*1&#xD;
the fugitives, as it aided them in concealing their&#xD;
course.&#xD;
That night march was one of the most formida-&#xD;
ble character. The extensive ridge of high lands,&#xD;
which ma~ b~ regarded as a continuation of the&#xD;
Beacon Mountain, extending south-westwardly to&#xD;
the Housatonic and beyond, from which the name&#xD;
of "Great Hill" was derived, was then, for the&#xD;
ii~ost part, a wilderness, covered with ~~voods pene-&#xD;
trated by Indian trails and lonely paths known only&#xD;
to those dwelling in the vicinity. He ~ry and Da-&#xD;
vid were familiar with the locality, having often&#xD;
traversed it in hunting, and were enabled to guide&#xD;
their companions through the intricacies of their&#xD;
course. The direct distance from Captain Woos-&#xD;
ter's to the Landing is about six miles; but the&#xD;
circuitous route taken by the robbers must have&#xD;
been nearly or quite a~ much again.&#xD;
Onward they sped in silence, with every sense&#xD;
awake to their danger, and' with loaded muskets&#xD;
ready to defend themselves if attacked. After&#xD;
traveling two or three hours they found themselves&#xD;

utterly exhausted, and coming to a clearing in the&#xD;
woods, where was a hut and a small barn adjacent,&#xD;
they crept into tpie latter in the hope of getting a&#xD;
little rest. .Thcy were note however, able. to: sleep&#xD;
much, and after struggling for an hour or two more&#xD;
with cold and fatigue, they set f rth again on their&#xD;
flight.&#xD;
At length the morning, began to dawn, and the&#xD;
weary fugitives found themselves within sight of&#xD;
'the L-anding at Derby. Hastening forward, they&#xD;
crossed the Naugatuck by the ,old bridge, where&#xD;
the road from Great Hill still passes, a little 'below&#xD;
the village of Ansonia. It was but a short distance&#xD;
from this bridge to the, house of Daniel Wooster,&#xD;
uncle of. Henry and David, Jr., which they had&#xD;
hoped to reach in season to obtain something to&#xD;
Seat before setting out for the Island. But the un-&#xD;
welcome light of the morning rendered this unsafe,&#xD;
and it only remained for them to press on in their&#xD;
flight as fast as possible.&#xD;
At that time the Natigatuck River, at and a lit-&#xD;
tle above its junction with the Housatonic, was&#xD;
'much deeper than it is now. The diversion 'of the -&#xD;
water from its natural channel, for the service of&#xD;
the niills at Birmingham, has allowed its bed to be--&#xD;

come partially choked with sand and debris. Here,&#xD;
under the high eastern bank of the stream, were.&#xD;
kept the boats and small craft belonging to the vil-&#xD;
lage. This point was reached by tide-water from&#xD;
the Sound, in consequence of which the river was&#xD;
seidorii completely frozen over, except in the sever-&#xD;
est weather. .Just below the junction a ferry-boat&#xD;
was accustomed to ply, connecting Derby with the&#xD;
opposite shore, from which a road ran along the&#xD;
western side of the Housatonic to Stratford.&#xD;
Rushing down the steep bank of the Naugatuck,&#xD;
the robbers foun'd an old whale-boat lying in the&#xD;
stream, partly filled with water. To wrench it&#xD;
from its fastenings, bail out the water with their&#xD;
hats, break open a boat-shed near by and steal a&#xD;
couple of pairs of oars, and push off into the open&#xD;
current, was. the work of but a few moments.&#xD;
Graham and the Woosters were skillful oarsmen,&#xD;
and a few vigorous strokes sent them out into the&#xD;
broad waters of: the. Housatonidc; and just as the&#xD;
first rays of the sun shot across the lofty hills that&#xD;
embosonmed the stream, they rounded the rocky&#xD;
point called the "Devil's Jump," projecting from&#xD;
the eastern shore, and laid their course down the&#xD;
rivei toward Long island.&#xD;

Meanwhile the pursuing party had followed as&#xD;
rapidly as the night permitted. It was impossible&#xD;
to keep their track during the darkness and along&#xD;
the obscure paths they had taken, but their general&#xD;
course was rightly conjectured, and Captain Steele&#xD;
and hjs company hastened forward, hoping to inter-&#xD;
cept them at certain points which it was believed&#xD;
they must necessarily pass. They, however, missed&#xD;
tl~eir aim in this respect, and just at dawn, as they&#xD;
approached the village, they again discovered traces&#xD;
of the robbers in the path. They galloped rapidly&#xD;
forward, crossed the bridge, and as they came down&#xD;
to the Landing had the mortification of perceiving&#xD;
the objects of their pursuit just going out of sight  4&#xD;
beyond th~e bend in the river below.&#xD;
For the moment the pursuit was arrested, and a&#xD;
consultation was held as to what should next be.&#xD;
* done. The news of the flight soon spread through&#xD;
the village; and a large number gathered to join in&#xD;
the chase.&#xD;
After a delay which seemed an age to the iri~pa-&#xD;
tient pursuers, the sleepy ferrynan was aroused,&#xD;
and transferred them to the opposite shore, where&#xD;
they set off at full speed on the road to Stratford.&#xD;
But the fugitives had started first, and did not fail&#xD;
to use the advantage to the utmost. Both wind&#xD;

and current favored them, ahd under the powerful&#xD;
strokes. of the rowers they made good speed. The&#xD;
whale~boats, of which theirs was one, were special-&#xD;
ly constructed for swiftness. "They were sharp at&#xD;
each end, the sheathing often not over half an inch&#xD;
thick, and so light as to be easily carried on men's&#xD;
holdersr, either to be hid in the bushes or re-&#xD;
l~u tYched in the South Bay. Some were thirty-two&#xD;
feet* long, and impelled by from eight to twenty&#xD;
oars, and wotild shoot ahead of an ordinary boat&#xD;
with great velocity, and. leave their pursuer~ far&#xD;
behind."'&#xD;
The distance from Derby along the course of the&#xD;
river to Stratford is fourteen miles. *About a mild&#xD;
below the Landing, the stream makes a1 cqnsidera-&#xD;
ble bend toward tbe east, and is divided~ bya long,&#xD;
low island, then covered by bushes. This, with&#xD;
the wooded banks of the river, concealed the boat&#xD;

distance across the chord of the arc, actually got in&#xD;
advance of the robbers before the latter had com-&#xD;

things, these halted under a close thicket upon the&#xD;
river bank, where for the time they were entirely&#xD;

lost to view, a/nd it became a question ~vith the pur-&#xD;
suers what had become of them. The latter, how-&#xD;
ever, continued on to the tavern, which was then&#xD;
known as the "half-way ho~se"to Stratford, near&#xD;
*    wh~re is now Z~ald~yin's Station; and having had no&#xD;
refreshments since the preceding evening, they&#xD;
*     concluded to halt here for breakfast, first stationing&#xD;
~        sentinels by the river-side to give notice if anything&#xD;
was seen of the boat. For some reason, however,&#xD;
this duty was but ill performed, and while the party&#xD;
were at 'the table in the tavern, the fugitives came&#xD;
silently ~nd swif~iy down the stream, in the shade&#xD;
of, the opposite bank, and before the alarm was&#xD;
given had already shot by the house, and were leav-&#xD;
ing their enemies behind them.,&#xD;
Jnstaritly the pursuers were notified, and the&#xD;
race began an w. The road henceforth passed&#xD;
along the high ~rounds at some distance from, but&#xD;
in full 'View of the stream and the fugitives, who&#xD;
clung as closely as possible to' the further shore.&#xD;
It was an exciting scene for both parties. The&#xD;
whale-boat was leaky, and required constant bailing&#xD;
to keep it from filling. There were only four oars&#xD;
for the whole party; poor ones at best. One of&#xD;
these, even, was for a while disabled by the breaking&#xD;
of the thole-pin. There were no mean~ of repla-&#xD;
&#xD;
cing this on board; and they did not dare to stop to&#xD;
procure another. One of the men, hoxvever, be-&#xD;
thought him of his bayonet, which he detached&#xD;
from the musket and substituted in its place. As&#xD;
it but ill-fitted the hole, 'Chauncey was ordered to&#xD;
grasp the socket and hold it firmly, and in this way&#xD;
it was made to serve as a'p~int of support for the&#xD;
oar. There is a tradition, also, that two 'others of&#xD;
their guns were similarly fastened on either side of&#xD;
the boat, and that one of the silk gowns stolen from&#xD;
Mrs Dayton was stretched across between them as&#xD;
*     a sail.                        a&#xD;
But despite their utmost exertions their pursuers,&#xD;
now increased to a large party~, gained upon them,&#xD;
and it seemed an even chance' ~vhich should reach&#xD;
the Point first. Here, however, die river was&#xD;
broad, and the boat, still clinging, to the eastern&#xD;
'bank, was inaccessible to those on the shore. As&#xD;
they passed the 'Point, they were1 hailed by some&#xD;
of the foremost and ordered to stop; at the ~same&#xD;
time several shots were fired at, them, which the&#xD;
distance rendered ineffective. The only notice&#xD;
taken of these was a loud hurrah from the boat,&#xD;
companies by one or two return shots; when, emer-&#xD;
ging from the river, they came upon the waters of&#xD;
the Sound, and were so~n far beyond reach.&#xD;

HE pursu rs were: baffled, but -not dis-&#xD;
couraged. From- their knowledge of&#xD;
localities upon the island, they did not&#xD;
doubt that, 'if immediately followed, the robbers&#xD;
might still be secured, and their- unfortunate cap-&#xD;
tive rescued. This could be done, however, only&#xD;
after suitable preparation. The undertaking would&#xD;
be difficult and dangerous. Boats must be ob-&#xD;
tained, and a suitable party enlisted to man 'them,&#xD;
and to' meet and overcome any force that would be&#xD;
likely to be ,encountered. It was decided, there-&#xD;

Arnong the- persons who had fled from Long&#xD;
Island in company with Captain Dayton, on its&#xD;
coming into possession of the British, was Captain&#xD;
William Clarke. He had been a townsman and&#xD;
neighbor of Dayton at Brookhaven, a lieutenant in&#xD;
one of the militia companies of that place, and&#xD;
actively engaged in all the measures of annoyance&#xD;
against the enemy and their tory' allies, including&#xD;
the privateering expeditions of Dayton and others.'&#xD;
Of course he was intimatel acquainted with the&#xD;
island and its shores. He was now- residing at&#xD;
.Derby, and offered to be a leader of the expedition&#xD;
in pursuit of the robbers.&#xD;
Two large whale-boats were promptly fitted out,&#xD;
with some fifteen men well armed in each ; indeed,&#xD;
there, were a hundred who were ready and eager to&#xD;
engage in it. All needed supplies were placed on&#xD;
board, and by the middle of the afternoon, the two&#xD;
craft, under the impulse of both sails and oars,&#xD;
started down the river. Calling again at Stratford&#xD;
Point, as they passed, they received the report of&#xD;
the lookout in the belfry, which confirmed them4 in&#xD;
~their expectation of success.&#xD;

"Come on, men," 'said Captain Clarke; "we can..&#xD;
not go amiss. They have gone to Brookhaven7&#xD;
and I know the very house 'where they will be&#xD;
found. We'll trap them all before morning. Pull&#xD;
away, my. hearties!"&#xD;
'Long Island. Sound is here about twenty miles&#xD;
wide, and the ~passage, even with a favoring wir~d,&#xD;
requires some' three or four hours. It was, then,&#xD;
late in the evening before the b9 ats reached their&#xD;
destination. TI drew up 'in a small cove at&#xD;
Crane's Neck, about three miles west of Brook-&#xD;
haven village. Two men were left as a guard.&#xD;
over the boats, with orders to keep them in readi-&#xD;
ness for instant departure; and the rest, having&#xD;
carefully pre-arranged their 'plans, * took up their&#xD;
march to the village.&#xD;
At that time, a man named John Bailey kept' a&#xD;
tavern at Brookhaven. He wa~ a known tory,1 and&#xD;
his house a somewhat' favorite resort for persons&#xD;
of that party, andy for British officers stationed in&#xD;
that vicinity. "Captain Clarke was of The opinion&#xD;
~hat the men.of whom they were in pursuit would&#xD;
be found there. He assumed that, having reached.&#xD;
~ Onderdonk's Incidents, p. 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
a supposed place of safety under British protection,&#xD;
they would seek, before all other things, food and&#xD;
* sleep. For two days they had had nothing to eat,&#xD;
and for twice that number of nights, little sleep.&#xD;
The flight from Gunntown, and the labor of rowing&#xD;
their leaky boat across the Sound,, had been most&#xD;
exhattsting, and wearied nature must h~.ve impera-&#xD;
'tively demanded rest. He believed, ti~refore, that&#xD;
th~ place to look for them was at Bailey's Tavern,&#xD;
and laid his plans accordingly.&#xD;
The houses of the ~place were, for the most part,&#xD;
wrapped in darkness, and the village seemed sunk&#xD;
in repose. As they. drew near to the tavern, how-&#xD;
ever, they perceived that there was a light burning&#xD;
in. one of its front rooms, making 9xtr~K caution&#xD;
necessary to prevent an alarm. All but two or&#xD;
three of the men were stationed around the house,&#xD;
while' Captain Clarke, Captain Harvey, who corn-&#xD;
man ded the other boat, and Walter Judd,. a brother&#xD;
of Chaunc-ey, advanced and knocked at the door.&#xD;
To 'the first summons no answer was returned;&#xD;
abut soon after, a louder knock brought a person&#xD;
with the light into the entry, with the incjuiry, -&#xD;

"We are sorry for that. Our business is urgent,&#xD;
and we cannot leave without seeing him."&#xD;
After an interval of a few moments, as if a con-&#xD;
sultation was had with another person, the door&#xD;
was unfastened; and a young woman appeared.&#xD;
"My father," sh&amp;amp; said, "has gone down to the&#xD;
city. We expected him to return to-night, but he&#xD;
has not done so, and from the direction of the&#xD;

This was a confirmation of their suspicions as to&#xD;
the pres5ce of the, robbers, and without ris1~ing&#xD;
further parley, Captain Clarke, who had 'hitherto&#xD;
carefully kept his face in the shade to avoid being&#xD;

"Give no alarm, on peril of your life !"&#xD;
At the same moment his companions, fitst sig-&#xD;
naling to ~~their men, as had been agreed upon,&#xD;
rushed als6 into the house, where, to their mutual&#xD;
surpriseahey found a British officer, who had been&#xD;
enjoying the society, of the young lady. With an&#xD;
instant command to silence, they assured ,him that&#xD;
no hostile design was entertained a~inst him or&#xD;
the family, their sole object being the arrest of a&#xD;
gang of burglars whom they had tracked to that&#xD;
house, and that if he made no resistance, he should.&#xD;
not be molested1, By that time, six or eight more&#xD;
of their men had entered, and learning from the&#xD;
lady 'the whereabouts of her guests, they seized the&#xD;
light, and ascended to the chambers.&#xD;
The whole proceeding was the wo.rk of. a mo-&#xD;
ment, and such was the silence of their movements,&#xD;
and so profound 'the slumber of the robbers, that,&#xD;
with a single exception, none of 'them were aware&#xD;
of their peril till the heavy hands of their captors&#xD;
were u~on them. Chauncey was found sleeping,&#xD;
as usual, by the side of Graham, and was 'firs&#xD;
aroused by being lifted bodily from the bed p~ th~&#xD;
strong arms of his brother, while two' ~th~rs, on&#xD;

leader of the gang, and before he had time to make&#xD;
any resistance, pinioned his hands and his feet.&#xD;
The others were secured, in like manner, with&#xD;
little comparative difficulty. Martin alone, hearing&#xD;
the noise in an' adjacent room, leaped from 'the&#xD;
window, and fled. He was pursued by one of the&#xD;
men on guard, who several times snapped his&#xD;
musket at him, but the old fire-lock refused to be*&#xD;
discharged, and after a sharp race of half a mile or&#xD;
more, he succeeded in reaching a thicket of bushes,&#xD;
where he was lost to view.&#xD;
We cannot undertake to depict the emotions of&#xD;
the culprits thus surprised in the midst of their&#xD;
slumbers. To Chauncey, notwithstanding his wea-&#xD;
riness, we may well believe it was a joyful awaking.&#xD;
He was almost dead from fatigue and exposure,&#xD;
and' was fast sinking into the apathy of despair.&#xD;
To find himself now out of the power of his cap-&#xD;
tors., greet ~d by the cheering words of a brother,&#xD;
and with ~he promise of an immediate return to&#xD;
his home, ~whi~h he had despaired of ever seeing&#xD;
ag~dn, was almost enough to rouse' and animate&#xD;
him had he been literally in ~the grave.&#xD;
To: the others; and Graham especially, it. was&#xD;
like the kn~ll ~of doom. After all they had suffered&#xD;
in their flight, almost in the very first moment&#xD;

when they had dared to feel themselves safe, to be&#xD;
seized and bound like felons, with the certainty' of&#xD;
a felon's punishment before them, was more than&#xD;
they could endure. Graham knew t1~at no mercy&#xD;
would be shown to him. The part he had acted ~n&#xD;
this mad expedition,' his relentless cruelty to his&#xD;
young captive, and behind all this, a long record&#xD;
of desertion and crime, 'which he could not hope&#xD;
'to keep from exposure, all rose like specter before,&#xD;
him, and pointed out to him a swift and ignomin-&#xD;
ious fate.&#xD;
Little time, however, was allowed for anticipa-&#xD;
tion, wh&amp;amp;her joyous or gloomy. Captain Clarke&#xD;
and his party knew that they were upon the ene-&#xD;
my's territory, and that, especially ~ince 9ne of 'the&#xD;
robbers had escaped, they were liable to a return'&#xD;
surprise at any moment. So, carefully tying their&#xD;
prisoners, two and two, and securing their arms&#xD;
aiYd packs of stolen goods, the whole company&#xD;
speedily set off for the boats. Everything was in&#xD;
readiness for them. The prisoners were separated,&#xD;
three in each boat, and Chauncey carefully&#xD;
wrapped in their loose outer jackets, and' covered'&#xD;
by a sail, so as to be as much a~ possible out of&#xD;
the reach of the wind, and a straight course then&#xD;
laid for the mouth of the Housatonic.&#xD;

This was acc otdi.ngly done, and he was fo~nd&#xD;

We have no information as to the manner Or&#xD;
the circumstances of his death. The fact, only ~\is&#xD;
attested by tradition; and agrees with the inherent&#xD;
probabilities of the case. It is probable, also, that&#xD;
he died hardened and reckless, as he had lived.&#xD;
For not in the natural world do the laws of cause&#xD;
and effect operate more surely than in the moral,&#xD;

ciecreerng the certain connection between a life' of&#xD;
sin and a death of infamy and hopelessness. 'It is&#xD;
not alone an enactment of divine justice, but a re-&#xD;

nature, that "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall&#xD;
he also reap.~~&#xD;
The remaining robbers having been dispatched&#xD;
to New Haven for confinement in the jail, Chaun-&#xD;
cey, accompanied by his brothers and other friends,,&#xD;
was taken to his home. Of the warmth and ten-&#xD;
derness of his reception there we can have no&#xD;
doubt. And he needed, all the care which the&#xD;
most assiduous nursing could afford. He had en-&#xD;
dured hardships which were enough to crush one*&#xD;
much stronger than he. , Indeed, he w4 for sev-&#xD;
&#xD;
eral days, partially insane. The shock to his&#xD;
nervous system, from the repeated imminent . pros~&#xD;
pect of death, increased by his severe bodily suffer-&#xD;
ings, had completely broken him down. Often&#xD;
would he awake from a sort of stupor in which he&#xD;
lay, and cry, "Hurrah for King George!" imagin-&#xD;
ing himself to be in the power. of his abductors&#xD;
still. During their flight down the river and across&#xD;
the Sound, he had been wholly unprotected from&#xD;
the wind, and had almost perished frdm~ cold. His&#xD;
hands, from holding the bayonet, had been frost-&#xD;
bitten, and some of his fingers remained stiffened~&#xD;
and crippled for life. It was believed by his family&#xD;
that the strength of his constitution was impaired&#xD;
by these hardships so that he never recovered&#xD;
from it, but continued in delicate health until his'&#xD;
death.&#xD;
On the first Tuesday in May, a special term of&#xD;

of the accused, and the romantic story of the ab-&#xD;
duction and maltreatment of young Judd, excited&#xD;
a profound interest throughout the county, and&#xD;
the sessions of the court were crowded with spec-&#xD;
tators. The counts of the indictment were two-&#xD;

the latter consisting' in joining or attempting to&#xD;
join the enemies of the state by going to Long&#xD;
Island, which, by a recent ldw of the state; had'&#xD;

secure the conviction, for it will be remembered&#xD;
that Chauncey~ could not testify to the fact of, the&#xD;
~kurglary, two of the accused, Scott and Cady,&#xD;
who were believed to be least conspicuous in the&#xD;
transact ion, were permitted to turn witnesses for&#xD;

received sentences as llows:&#xD;

These heavy fines and payments for damages,&#xD;

~ used for about half a centtfry as a state&#xD;
prison, and named from the more noted debtors'&#xD;

annals of Connecticut.&#xD;
It is situated on the western slope ofthat green~-&#xD;
stone mountain range which traverses the whole&#xD;
breadth of New England, and* separates the Far-&#xD;
rnington from the C6nn~cticut River Valley. How&#xD;
early copper was, discovered here is not known, but&#xD;
it is mentioned in the proceedings of a town meet-&#xD;
ing of Simsbury in 1705, when a committee was&#xD;
~appointed to make expLorations, and report to the&#xD;

mine and smelting the ore, with the stipulation&#xD;
that one tenth of the product should belong to the&#xD;
town. It is a curious fact, as indicating what class&#xD;
of' persons in that day were supposed to have suf-&#xD;
ficient knowledge to tarry on such a work, that&#xD;
the three contractors were all clergymen; also,&#xD;
that, of the portion that was to come to the town,&#xD;
two thirds should be applied for the maintenance&#xD;
"of an able schoolmaster in Simsbury," and one&#xD;
third to the endowment of the "Collegiate School,"&#xD;
founded five years before, ftow Yale College.&#xD;
Mining operations were cQnt'inu~d here, from&#xD;
time to time, until the Revolution, but probably&#xD;
without bringing very satisfactory returns to any-&#xD;
body. The ore was not rich, containing only from&#xD;
ten to twelve per cent. of metal, and the work of&#xD;
reducing it, in the existing state of scientific knowl-&#xD;
edge, very difficult. The same jealousy, before&#xD;
spoken of, lest there should be any rivalry to the&#xD;
productions of the mother c6pntry, which restrained&#xD;
the introduction of manufacturing into the colo-~&#xD;
nies, operated as a check to successful mining7 the&#xD;
business of smelting and refining being prohibited&#xD;
by acts of Parlia~n ent. The proprietors, therefore,'&#xD;
were compelled o ship their ore to England to be&#xD;

reduced, involving, of cOurse, great expense and&#xD;
risk. One cargo was wrecked in the English&#xD;
Channel, another captured by the French.&#xD;
Thee copper produced from these mines was said&#xD;
to be of a superi4 r quality. Some of i(vas coined&#xD;
in the shape of money, called, from the name of the&#xD;
maker; "Higley's coppers," which passed current&#xD;
in the vicinity. They bore on one side the in-&#xD;
scription, "I am good copper," and on the other,&#xD;
Value me as you please." They are said to have&#xD;
passed for two shillings and sixpence, currency,&#xD;
about forty-two cents, - which must have exceeded&#xD;
their real value. These were much sought after,&#xD;
and used in melting up with gold for the making&#xD;
of pinchbeck and other base metals, .employed in&#xD;
the manufacture' of j~eweIry.&#xD;
At' the time it began to be used as a prison,&#xD;
the mine consisted of two shafts sunk perpendicu-&#xD;
larly through the solid rock one thirty-five, the&#xD;
other seventy-five feet in depth. From the bot-&#xD;
toms of these, extensive caverns, excavated for ore,&#xD;
descended several hundred feet into the mountain,&#xD;
in a sloping direct ion, according to the ~~lay of the&#xD;
vein, terminating in levels o~ drains, which had&#xD;

In May, 1773, the, first steps were taken by the&#xD;

lowing, the committee reported that they-had pur-&#xD;
chased the remaining term of th~ lease nineteen&#xD;
years for sixty pounds; that, by blasting rocks,&#xD;
they had prepared a 'well-finished lodging-room,&#xD;
Phelps' History of Newgate, p. 'I.&#xD;
&#xD;
about fifteen feek by twelve, in the cavern, and had&#xD;
fixed over the west and shorter shaft a large iron&#xD;
door, etc. The, eastern shaft was left open, its.&#xD;
depth and bare perpendicular walls of rock being.&#xD;
judged sufficient to prevent escapes. There were&#xD;
no buildings upon the premises, nor any~ walls to&#xD;
prevent external access to the shafts.&#xD;
Such was the place provided by the c'ok5ny fore-&#xD;
most on this continent, if not in the world, for its&#xD;
regard for Christianity, - the home of churches&#xD;
and schools, for the punishment of her criminals.&#xD;
Let it be imputed, not to her inconsistency v~ith her&#xD;
professions, but to her ignorance of what the prison&#xD;
system of a Christian state should and might be,&#xD;
that she established one that might, almost without~&#xD;
a figure, be styled infernal. Thrust down into,&#xD;
subterranean caverns, dripping perpetually with&#xD;
water from above, where no ray of sunlight could&#xD;
ever penetrate; compelled to sleep on, straw in&#xD;
damp~ and moldy bunks, and left to contaminate&#xD;
each other by endless recitals of past crimes ~nd&#xD;
endless plo things of new, it is no wonder'that its&#xD;
inmates, instead of being reformed, emerged more&#xD;
hardened in all evil, to become the , scourge and,&#xD;
terror: of the community.&#xD;

&#xD;
At that time nothing was known of our modern&#xD;
prison discipline. Howard, Mrs. Fry~ and other&#xD;
philanthropists had not disclosed to the world the&#xD;
horrors of European prisons, an~1 roused the benev-&#xD;
olent to undertake some measures fpr their reform.&#xD;
The sole considerations which seem to have influ-&#xD;
enced the legislature of Connecticut one hundred&#xD;
years ago, in constructing a prison, were the safe-&#xD;
keeping of the 'prisoners, and the smallest expense&#xD;
to the colony.&#xD;
The first convict received to the mine was sent&#xD;
there in December, 1773. He escaped three~ weeks&#xD;
afterward through the eastern shaft, being drawn&#xD;
up by a rope, assisted, it is said, by a woman to&#xD;
whom he was paying ~addPesses. In Febituary,&#xD;
1774, three prisoners were received, all of whom&#xD;
escaped in less than two months; in April, another&#xD;
who had been. there but four days. It is to be&#xD;
remembered, that, besides the open eastern shaft,&#xD;
there were other parts of the caverns which had&#xD;
not been properly secured. The men, too, wc~re at&#xD;
first employed in digging the ore of the mine, and&#xD;
found their tools not only adapted to that labor,&#xD;
but to open for themselves the wa~ of escape.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the proved insecurity of this&#xD;
&#xD;
prison, it had the reputation abroad of being supe-&#xD;
rior in strength to any other in.the country. Two&#xD;
years after its first occupancy, General Washington&#xD;
sent hither a number of culprits for confinement.&#xD;
They are, he says, "such flagrant and atrocious&#xD;
villains, that they cannot by any means be set at&#xD;
large, or confined in any place in this camp." Con-&#xD;
gress too, in 1781, applied to Govei~nor Trumbull&#xD;
(the "Brother Jonathan," so called affectionately&#xD;
by Washington, from whom the appellation has&#xD;
passed to. the entire Ameritan peopl~) for th~ use&#xD;
of the mines as a\ prison "for the reception of&#xD;
British prisoners o~f war, ahd, for the purpose of&#xD;
retaliation." Happy was it for all the parties con-&#xD;
cerned that the war itself came to a. close before&#xD;
the negotiations for this purpose were completed.&#xD;
In i 774-5 the eastern shaft was closed, and a&#xD;
block-house of logs built over the western one,&#xD;
which admitted entrance to the caverns through a&#xD;
heavy iron door. This, with the keeper's house&#xD;
adjacent, was soon burned. New buildings were&#xD;
then ordered to be erected, among them a work-&#xD;
shop above ground. These were not completed&#xD;
till November 1780, the prisoners, meanwhile, be-*&#xD;
ing confined in Hartford Jail. In 1781 the prem-&#xD;

ises were first enclosed ?th a picket fence, with&#xD;
bastions at the corners fo security. But this and&#xD;
the other buildings were again destroyed by fire,&#xD;
and for a time the idea of successfully maintaining&#xD;
a prison here seems to have been abandoned.- At&#xD;
last, taught by experience, the legislature passed a&#xD;
new act, more perfect in its details, providing not&#xD;
only for the repair of the old fixtures, but the build-&#xD;
ing of sMitable workshops, a keeper's house, etc., all&#xD;
to be enclosed within ,a strong stone wall.' The&#xD;
work was completed at an' expense to the stgte of&#xD;
over three thousand dollars. The prison was now&#xD;
found to be/secure, and was thenceforth maintained&#xD;
until the completion of the new State Prison in&#xD;
Wethersfield in 1827.&#xD;
The work of mining was 'subsequently renewed&#xD;
by parties who had purchased the, premises 'from&#xD;
the state, the old workshops being used as foun-&#xD;
deries for smelting the ore. It is now, however,&#xD;
abandoned, though the old wall, the guard-house,&#xD;
and many of the other buildings remain. The&#xD;
whole is worth a visit by those who would get a&#xD;
full idea of the changes which have been effected&#xD;
in the half century past in the prison discipline&#xD;
of N~w England.&#xD;

&#xD;
It was not until November that the work 'of&#xD;
repairing and refitting at the prison was completed,&#xD;
so as to be ready for die reception of the conVicts.&#xD;
Meanwhile, pursuant to their sentence, they were&#xD;
detained at the jail in Hartford.&#xD;
Newgate was now in a much better condition~,&#xD;
than ever before. it was kept under a strong mili-&#xD;
tary guard, consisting of a lieutenant, a sergeant, a&#xD;
corporal, and twenty-four privates. The whole&#xD;
number of prisoners was about twenty, of whom&#xD;
the greater part were stories. A' law had been&#xD;
passed, the spring before, authorizing the superior&#xD;
court to sentence to Newgate persons convicted of&#xD;
acts of disloyalty to the state. Courts-martial were&#xD;
clothed with similar power in cases occurring un~&#xD;
der military jurisdiction. These persons were of a&#xD;
higher class than ordinary criminals, being fre-&#xD;
quently men of education and property. One of&#xD;
them was a clergyman named Baxt~r, who preached&#xD;
a sermon to his fellow-convicts from Judges xv. i&#xD;
entitled, "~Tyrarinicide proved Lawful, from the&#xD;
practice of Jews, Heathens, and Chrj~tians. ~A&#xD;

rebel magistrates. It is garnished with. Latin and&#xD;
numerous from Greek and Roman au-&#xD;

The confinement of such persons as these with&#xD;
common burglars, horse thieves, counterfeiters, and&#xD;
other felons, shows how intense were the feelings&#xD;
of indignation existing in the minds of the patriots&#xD;
against those who were regarded as enemies to&#xD;
~ their country's liberties.&#xD;
Previous to this time the prisoners had been&#xD;
kept at labor in digging ore in the mines. A work-&#xD;
shop. having now been built above ground, they&#xD;
were henceforth~ employed in mechanical labor,&#xD;
chiefly in making nails. The machinery by which&#xD;
nails are now produced had not then been in-&#xD;
vented; hence all that were used, of every size,&#xD;
had to be made by hand, in consequence of which&#xD;
they were scarce and expensive.'&#xD;

ET us draw a picture~ of daily prison life&#xD;
in the Newgate of Conne~icut one hun-&#xD;
E~. dred years ago. At daybreak, summer&#xD;
and winter, the heavy iron trap-door covering the&#xD;
shaft is unbarred, and by the united strength of&#xD;
two men thrown open. A guard of soldiers with&#xD;
loaded muskets are drawn up in line before it. A&#xD;
bell is rung, summoning the convicts from the&#xD;
depths below to their daily toil. Slowly and pain-&#xD;
fully they ascend the perpendicular iron ladder,&#xD;
forty feet, iii length, their limbs heavily loaded with&#xD;
~both handcuffs and fetters. They qome forth iii&#xD;
squads of three each, followed by a g~uard. Unable&#xD;
to walk, they hobble along the way to the ~vork~&#xD;
shop, where they are placed at their work. ' Then&#xD;

thus disposed of. Some are chained by the leg to&#xD;
their forges, others to wheelbarrows) and such as&#xD;
are vicious and refractory have iron collars sus-&#xD;
pended from the roof locked about their Pecks.&#xD;
The guards take their stations in the shops, 4he&#xD;
handcuffs are removed to allow the use of their&#xD;
hands, and the labors of the day begin.&#xD;
Twice during the day work is suspended, and an&#xD;
hour ip assigned for meals. Pieces of.pickled pork&#xD;
or beef are brought in and distributed one to each&#xD;
*    man. 'These are washed and boiled by each at his&#xD;
forge,~ in the water provided for cooling the iron.&#xD;
One p~und of bread, a few potatoes, and a pint of&#xD;
cider niake up the idst. of the daPy ration, varied&#xD;
sometimes by peas or other vegetables. Each one&#xD;
divides his rations for the day to suit himself, and&#xD;
they are allowed to exchange with each other, to&#xD;
barter, buy and sell, at their pleasure.&#xD;
Regular tasks of labor were assigned the, prison-&#xD;
ers, and when these were finished they night work&#xD;
for themselves or for others. In this way some of&#xD;
them acquired considerable sums of money. The&#xD;
ingenious made trinketswhich were readily sold to&#xD;
visitors. * It sounds strangely ~enoug in this day to&#xD;
state that the warden of the prison kept ~. tavern&#xD;

near by, where not only visitors, but the convi&#xD;
themselves, might procure liquors, cider, tobacco,~&#xD;
or whatever other luxuries they desired. He who&#xD;
could muster money enough would prevail on. some&#xD;
one of the guard to escort him over the way ~o the&#xD;
inn, where the good-natured Captain Viets would&#xD;
deal out the coveted refreshment to them both.&#xD;
For neglect of d~ty and other offenses the men&#xD;
were punished by flogging, confinement in the&#xD;
stocks, double or triple nets of irons, hanging up&#xD;
by the l}eels, etc. Everything of this sort tended&#xD;
to inflame their anger and revenge, and seldom was&#xD;
any appeal made to their reason or better feelings.&#xD;
The men were allowed at all ti~es to converse with&#xD;
their keepers and with each other.&#xD;
At four o~c1loqk in the afternoon the tasks of the&#xD;
day were finished. The handcuffs were replaced,&#xD;
the collars and fetters unlocked, and with the same&#xD;
leaping and hobbling the m~n, unless granted the&#xD;
indulgence of remaining for over Work, as'~ already&#xD;
stated, made their way back to th~ pit. As they&#xD;
passed the trap, a tit of candle, one inch long, was&#xD;
given to each; thc~n, holding up his shackles as he&#xD;
best could, he crept backward down the ladder to&#xD;

Arriving below, he might retire at once to his&#xD;

they contrive to. free themselves from their haj-&#xD;

Henry Wooster was one qf those who had~ suc-&#xD;
ceeded in i~eleasing his hands from their, fetters&#xD;
at night, bein~ careful, of course, to replace them&#xD;
before going up to his work in the morning. One&#xD;
of the first things he attempted was to make a&#xD;
thorough exploration of the caverns, to see if there&#xD;
was any possible way of egress. For this purpose&#xD;
he forced himself into one of the drains which dis-&#xD;
charged the waters of the mine. This, after the&#xD;
occupancy of the niines as a prison, had been care-&#xD;
fully built up with stone and mortar, leaving only a&#xD;
narrow channel, which was supposed to be thor-&#xD;
oughly secur~ d by iron bars. But patient labor&#xD;
laughs at ob tackles. Watching his opportunities,&#xD;
Henry contrived to conceal in his clothes frag-&#xD;
ments of the rods of which nails were made, and&#xD;
qarry them below. With~these he picked' out, little.&#xD;
by little, bits of the mortar until the bars were&#xD;
loosened sq as to permit , their, removal. In the&#xD;
same way he enlarged the drain in some of its nar-&#xD;
rowest places, and after many weeks of assiduous&#xD;
toil found himself near the outer orifice.&#xD;
Redoubled exertions followed, in which he was&#xD;
aided, as far as possible, by others who had the use&#xD;
of their hands. It was a fatiguing and most, dan~&#xD;

gerous task. The straitness of the passage barely&#xD;
permitted him to drag himself along it without the&#xD;
power of turning, and to get back was still more&#xD;
difficult. 'Once, indeed, while far within, he gave&#xD;
himself up for lost. A stone overhead, whidh he&#xD;
had loosened partially, fell 'into the drain after1 he&#xD;
had passed, effectually closing it like a porteullis,&#xD;
and debarring his return. Unable to reverse his'&#xD;
position, or reach it with his hands, he concluded,&#xD;
ft~r a time, that his last hour was come, an.d that he&#xD;
must perish in his terrible prison. His' cries for&#xD;
help could scarcely be he~ird by the other convicts,&#xD;
and if heard, it was doubtful whether they could&#xD;
relieve him. It wa~ an awful; moment for the&#xD;
wretched criminal, extQrting even from his hardened&#xD;
heart an ~onizing si4pplication for mercy from&#xD;
Him to whom he had never prayed before:&#xD;
At length, on pressing the stone with' his foot,&#xD;
I-Lenr perceived that 'it w~s loose, and continuing&#xD;
to work it as fat' as he was ~b1e, it finally fell coin-&#xD;
pletely through from the p~ ace where it hung sus-&#xD;
pended iyto the drain. Fu ther effort showed that&#xD;
he could push it a little along the passage~behind&#xD;
him. But would it pass 'the whole distance? for&#xD;

sions, he would be as~ inextricably shut in as if' the&#xD;
drain had been hermetically sealed.&#xD;
Bracing himself against the sides of the channel,&#xD;
and pressing the obstacle with all his strength, ~i&#xD;
succeeded at length in getting it to a little depres-&#xD;
sion or hollow on the bottom, which would permit&#xD;
of his passing over it. With desperate energy he&#xD;
crowded hirpself by, and at l~st emerged into the&#xD;
prison a little before the dayl~reak bell sounded to&#xD;
call the men to their labor. He had been in the&#xD;
drain all nio~ht and came forth bruised, bleeding,&#xD;
an&amp;amp; utterly exhausted. It would not do, however,&#xD;
to let his suffering condition be knoWn, foil this&#xD;
would inevitably lead to a search and exposure; so,&#xD;
donning, with the help of his comrades, his parentss&#xD;
and irons (for he had gone into the drain naked), he&#xD;
dragged himself up the ladder to his workJ If his&#xD;
bruised and haggard condition was noticed, it ex-&#xD;
cited no remark, the evidences of' fighting and&#xD;
sleeplessness being too common among the wretch-&#xD;
ed culprits, to awaken any suspicion.&#xD;
A fe~w nights after this, having recovered some-&#xD;
what' from the sufferings he had incurred, it was&#xD;
judged practicable to complete their escape, and&#xD;
Henry. and a few others made preparations to leave.&#xD;

A'mong.these was a man ~named. Prescott, of New&#xD;
Haven, who had been sentenced to the prison for&#xD;
smuggling. David Wooster and Doolittle seem&#xD;
not to have participated in the attempt, for what&#xD;
reason is not known; possibly being unable to ex~&#xD;
tricate themselves from their fetters sufficiently to&#xD;
warrant the attempt. It was an hour before day&#xD;
when H enry and his associates broke through the&#xD;
remaining portion of the drain and fled into the&#xD;
woods. Tlj eir escape w~s sooi~i discovered and&#xD;
the alarm given. iMost of~ the others were retaken&#xD;
and conveyed back to prison. Henry, more fort~.i-&#xD;

~when h&amp;amp; began his flight, and finally succeeded in&#xD;
reaching the coast at or near New London, and&#xD;
made his. way on board an English vessel, where he&#xD;
enlisted in the British service.&#xD;
Not long after this a general plan of insurrec-&#xD;
tion and escape was carried through successfully.&#xD;
About ten o'clock at night, May i8, x78i, when all&#xD;
the guard but two had' retired to rest,~ the wife of&#xD;
one of the prisoners applied for permission to visit&#xD;
her husband in the caverns.' This was not an un-&#xD;

sprang through , snatched the guns belonging to&#xD;
the two men on duty, and made themselves map-&#xD;

could be aroused. dne of the officers, named Shel-&#xD;
don, learning the state df affairs, made a desperate&#xD;
fight; but the brave fellow was stabbed by a bayo-&#xD;
net, and died in a few minutes. The other soldiers,&#xD;
after a short ~struggle, were overcome, a few fled,&#xD;
and thea remainder were thrust by~ the prisoners into&#xD;
the caverns and locked in. ~The prisoners, twenty-&#xD;
eight in number, it is said, all escaped, and being&#xD;
now well armed, most of them avoided a recapture.&#xD;
'Such is the statement given in the History of the&#xD;

or else David Wooster and Samuel Doolittle were&#xD;

in the'villainous conduct of plundering the house of&#xD;

might be released from prison, and allowed to re-&#xD;

Seeley and Wooding obtained also some abate-&#xD;

war was visibly drawing to a close, the dangers 're-&#xD;
sulting from disaffection to the ~zoun try diminished,&#xD;
and the feelings which had been cherished against&#xD;
it were much softened.&#xD;
The estate of David Wooster, having been con-&#xD;
fiscated, was, after a few years, placed in the care&#xD;
of the town of Waterbury for the support of Woos-&#xD;

New England, and his request was granted. Mrs.&#xD;
Wooster was then engaged in preparing a kettle of&#xD;
hasty-pudding, for the family supper, and at her in-&#xD;
vitation the traveler partook of the repast. Jt~ the&#xD;
course of it he contrived to turn 'the conversation&#xD;
upon the subject of her own family, and especially&#xD;
of her absent son. She recounted with a mother's&#xD;
partiality 'his amiable qualities, his manly agility&#xD;
and strengths Won by the interest he seemed to&#xD;
manifest in her story, she bewailed the sad, occa-&#xD;

suaded him to go off on a mad undertaking of re-&#xD;
venge on a piratical Yankee captain, in conse-&#xD;
quence of which he ~had got into prison. After a&#xD;
while he broke out with others, since which she had&#xD;
heard nothing from him, and presumed he must be&#xD;
dead.&#xD;
At length, when he had sufficiently draWn forth&#xD;
these reminiscences of the good woman, the trav~~&#xD;
eler assumed his natural speech ~and manner, and&#xD;
announced himself as 'her missing son. At first&#xD;
&#xD;
#4&#xD;
&#xD;
she was incredulous, and unable to recognize him,&#xD;
till, opening the bosom of his shirt, he showed her*&#xD;
a mole on his breast. This well-remembered mark&#xD;
convinced her of his identity. She fell on his neck,&#xD;
and, like the father of the prodigal, wept tears of&#xD;
joy over her long-lost boy.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;

AEWERWARD.&#xD;
&#xD;
we ~writing ~a tale of fiction, we&#xD;
~ERE&#xD;
should feel bound, in deference to, the&#xD;
feelings of our readers, to end our story&#xD;
with the marriage o Chauncey Judd with Ditha&#xD;
Webb. For certainly that first unfortunate adt of&#xD;
gallantry, which occasioned him so much suffering,&#xD;
and had so nearly cost him his life, deserved to be&#xD;
crowned with a correspondingly ~1it~u~ resuk.&#xD;
But we are writing history, not fiction; and his-&#xD;
tory, though often a maker of romance, ha~ little&#xD;
regard for that which is prepared for her, by the&#xD;
schemes of men. The allotments of human' expe-&#xD;
rience are the prerogative of a higher Wisdom than&#xD;
our own. In the, beautiful language of 'another,&#xD;
"Every man's life is a alan of God," who shapes&#xD;
its progress~and its issues to promote purposes of&#xD;

good beyond our linlited vision,' and reaching'down&#xD;
through unmeasured ages of the future.&#xD;
Ditha's family early removed from Gunntown&#xD;
into what was .then the far-off region of Central&#xD;
New York. Of her subsequent history we are&#xD;
not informed.&#xD;
Chauncey resided with his parents after* his res-'&#xD;
toration. Though the war was prolonged nearly&#xD;
three years further, yet the circumstances of the&#xD;
family were somewhat more comfortable than they&#xD;
had been in its earlier years. The money received&#xD;
from the stories served to remove the debt which&#xD;
rested 'on the homesteadd, and complete the "doing&#xD;
off" of ~the house so far as it ever, was accomplished.&#xD;
The children were now getting~to be olderthe four&#xD;
eldest having married and commenced housekeep-~&#xD;
ing for themseWes, and the younger ones approach-&#xD;
'ing more nearly the age when their labor was of&#xD;
substantial value in the kitchen and on the farm.&#xD;
Chauncey~s slender frame and delicate health,&#xD;
serving as a constant reminder of the hardships&#xD;
he '.had undergone, made him rather the favored.&#xD;
member' of .the family, as they secured for him a&#xD;
peculiarly tender regard' in the social circle of the&#xD;
neighborhood.&#xD;

&#xD;
AFTERWARfl.            309&#xD;
&#xD;
It was at what would now be thought a pr~ina-&#xD;
ture age that Chauncey took to himself a wife. As&#xD;
we scan the family records of those times, we are&#xD;
struck with the prevalence of early marriages.&#xD;
Why, indeed,~ should there have been delay? A&#xD;
young man became of age at twenty-one, and could&#xD;
not well enter upon his life~work as a farmer till he&#xD;
had a home and a household of his own. Chaun-&#xD;
cey's mother married in her seventeenth year, and&#xD;
was not eighteen years older than her oldest son.&#xD;
It was to such beginnings, coupled with industry&#xD;
and temperance, that we are to attribute the nu-&#xD;
merous and healthy families of that day. The&#xD;
blessing c~f the tull-quivered sire rested upoii many&#xD;
a patriarchal household.&#xD;
Among the young people who were intimate in&#xD;
the family was the young sister of his uncle Wil-&#xD;
liams~s wife, Mabel Hotchkiss. She was, as before&#xD;
stated, the daughter of Captain and Deacon Gideon&#xD;
H~chkiss, the veteran soldier and one of the lead-&#xD;
ing. men of the town. The houses of the Judds&#xD;
and Williamses were but a few rods apart. Mabel,&#xD;
of course, was a frequent visitor at her, sister's, and&#xD;
SO: it was the most natural thing in the world that&#xD;
he should have won her regard. Like Desdeniona,&#xD;
in the play,&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
"She loved him for the dangers he had passed,&#xD;
And he loved her that she did pity them."&#xD;
They were married in September, 1785, a little bed&#xD;
fore the completion of his twenty-first year.&#xD;
Little remains to record of his subsequent life.&#xD;
The religious impressions made upon his mind in&#xD;
the anguish of his terrible trial never left him. He&#xD;
became known as a man of exemplary character&#xD;
and devotedd piety. He, was at one time chosen a.&#xD;
deacQn in the Ba~~ist church, but his great diffi~&#xD;
d~nce and self-distrust lead him to decline the office.&#xD;
His wife died about 1799, after which' he married&#xD;
9&#xD;
again.&#xD;
His 'own death occurred February 24,' 1823, at&#xD;
the age of fifty-three.&#xD;
Of the stories who engaged actively in the war&#xD;
against the independence, of America, the subse-&#xD;
quent 'history was for the most part a melancholy&#xD;
one. Probably not more than dne half of those&#xD;
who went from Waterbury ever returned. Those&#xD;
who did were mos'tfy broken-down men, reduced to&#xD;
poverty, laden with -the odium of having made war&#xD;
upon their country, and in many cases stained with&#xD;
vice, and addicted to habits which sent them to an&#xD;
early grave.&#xD;
&#xD;
C&#xD;

It was one of the questions which most impeded&#xD;
the negotiations for peace between the states and&#xD;
Great Britain in 1783, what shouJd be done with&#xD;
these stories. Several thousand in the aggregate&#xD;
had removed to Canada, New Brunswick, an~l Nova&#xD;
S~otia, the greater part of whom were in circum-&#xD;
stances of extreme destitution. .Jt was at first&#xD;
insisted by the British negotiators that Congress&#xD;
should grant pardons to all political offenders of&#xD;
this sort, restore4 their confiscated estates, and re-&#xD;
munerate then~ for the lQsses they had suffered.&#xD;
This was "refused, on the ground, first, that Con-&#xD;
gress was without the requisite authority, its sole&#xD;
power, under the Articles of Confederation, being&#xD;
to recommend measures to the several states. Sec-&#xD;
ondly, these men, by their principles, example, and&#xD;
counsels, had encouraged the British government&#xD;
to prosecute the war, and many had personally en-&#xD;
gaged in plundering and ravaging the country, and&#xD;
ought rather to be made to render compensation&#xD;
than expect to receive it. Thirdly, that the confis-&#xD;
cated estates had been sold and resold, often di-&#xD;
vided, ~nd could not now be restored without open-&#xD;
ing the way to endless litigation. And finally, that&#xD;
in the impoverished condition of the country it was&#xD;
&#xD;
impossible to pay its own ~iieritorious soldiers;&#xD;
much more those who had done so much to , bring&#xD;
ruin both upon it and themselves.&#xD;
The matter was at length compromised by in-&#xD;
serting three articles into the treaty to the effect&#xD;
thatxthe loyalists should not be debarred from~ col-&#xD;
lecting debts clue them before the war; that Con-&#xD;
gress would recommend to th~e states to restore&#xD;
confiscated property as far as possible, and that no&#xD;
future confiscations should be made or prosecutions&#xD;
begun because of what had been done. These terms,&#xD;
which were certainly most generous on the part of&#xD;
the infant states, were finally, though with great re-&#xD;
luctance, accepted by Great Britain,' and the peace&#xD;
was concluded on that basis.&#xD;
The recommendations of Congress to the states&#xD;
were, however, ineffectual, as it was probably ex-&#xD;
pected they wpuld. be. Connecticut would not con-&#xD;
sent to restore 'the property of such ~s had. been&#xD;
engaged in plundering and burning Danbury, Fair-&#xD;
field, and other sea-coast towns. The sai~ e was&#xD;
true in other states. Let England, tijey said, p~y&#xD;
us for the wanton injuries she has inflicted before&#xD;
she asks compensatiofl for the traitors by whom it&#xD;
was done.&#xD;

Failing thus in securing relief from the states&#xD;
for the refugees, Parliament undertook the duty for&#xD;
themselves. A commission was appointed to ob~&#xD;
tam returns of the losses incurred by their friends,&#xD;
and ultimately a sum amounting to about fifteen&#xD;
and a half millions of dollars was appropriated&#xD;
from the British exchequer for their compensation.&#xD;
"The loyalists then," says Sabine, "were weil&#xD;
cared for. Whatever were the miseries to individ-.&#xD;
uals occasioned by delay; whatever the injury. sus-.&#xD;
tamed by those who were unable to procure suffi-.&#xD;
* cient evidence of their losses; and whatever Were&#xD;
the 'wrongs inflicted upon others by the errors in&#xD;
judgment on the part of the commissioners, the&#xD;
Americans who took the royal side, as a body, fared&#xD;
infinitely better than the great bod of the whigs,&#xD;
whose services and sacrifices were quite as great.&#xD;
For besides the allowance of fifteen and a half mil-&#xD;
lions of dollars in money, numbers received corisid-&#xD;
* enable gratuities, half pay as military officers, large&#xD;
grants Qf land, and shared with other subjects in&#xD;
* the patronage of the crown., The rewards of those&#xD;
who served under Congress, on the other hand,&#xD;
* were exceedingly limited.; and excepting those who&#xD;
&#xD;
filled the public offices under the state and after the&#xD;
adoption of the Constitution of the United States,&#xD;
under the national government, few who served in&#xD;
£he field, or who suffered by. the ravages 'of the&#xD;
king's troops obtained considerable or adequate&#xD;
recompense. In truth, thousands, were allowed&#xD;
to go down to the grave in abject want and desti-&#xD;
tution." ~&#xD;
We must spare room, ere we close, for a single&#xD;
paragraph respecting our friends Tobiah a~d Ra-&#xD;
chel, and their descendants. After the war, they&#xD;
continued to reside in Derby, now .Seymour, main-&#xD;
taining .a respectable character in th9 humble class&#xD;
to which they belonged. The advantage of com-&#xD;
mon schools free to all, .the abolition of slavery,&#xD;
and the gradual abatement of prejudice against the&#xD;
colored race, have opened to them possibilities&#xD;
which were formerly denied them. One of Tobi-'&#xD;
ah's descendants, a great-grandson, we believe,&#xD;
the Hon. Ebenezer D. Bas~ett, was appointed&#xD;
~by President Grant, in 1869, minister resident to&#xD;
Hayti, and now worthily represents the dignity of&#xD;
the' United States at that republic.&#xD;

A century has passed, and the feeble colonies&#xD;
which, at such expense of treasure an~ suffering, in&#xD;
private and public, planted hcre the germs of a free&#xD;
government, have become a rich and powerful na~&#xD;
tion. The wildest dre~tms of our fathers as to thc&#xD;
future could never have conjectured what haVe now&#xD;
,~ become realities. The grandchildren and great-&#xD;
grandchildren of our Revolutionary families live in&#xD;
homes which would then have been palaces, and&#xD;
enjoy luxuries which the proudest nobles of the&#xD;
mother land could not then have commanded. The&#xD;
blessings of just laws, of universal and free educa~&#xD;
tion, of unrestricted enterprise in every branch of&#xD;
industry, and of free, self-administered institutions&#xD;
of religion, are enjoyed by every citizen. We shall&#xD;
not have read the lessons of our early history&#xD;
aright, if we have not learned from then~ a just ap-&#xD;
preciation of our blessings, a~d a heartfelt gratb&#xD;
tude for them to Him who gave them.&#xD;
