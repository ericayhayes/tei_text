CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE OBJECTION?.             4&#xD;
"Nora Wilmot,, I think you are the most ridiculously&#xD;
absurd girl I ever saw; a paragon of sense and a&#xD;
stereotype of nonsense-a warm-hearted friend and an&#xD;
ice-cold coquette; and an old maid, in embryo, is my&#xD;
prophesy. You nonsensical little creature, to reject the&#xD;
hand, and the heart too, of a young gent that eoul4&#xD;
turn the heads, to say nothing of the hearts, of half&#xD;
the young ladies in Christendom. Why, I tell you, my&#xD;
conceited little coz, Fred Morley could have the consent,&#xD;
without the asking, of any mother of a marriageable&#xD;
daughter in the community to pay special attention;&#xD;
but one high-minded beauty can coolly say, No! even&#xD;
without giving any logical reasons, only because Mr.&#xD;
Morley has been known to indulge in a potati6n (o~ca~&#xD;
sionally) a little stronger than pure cold water; and&#xD;
then (a lamentably worse fact than all that) is not will-&#xD;
ing to set his face,, as steel, against one 'of nature's&#xD;
own gifts to man. But I presume if he would tnril&#xD;
special lecturer, and bring the whole force of hi&amp;amp;fhrllb.&#xD;
ing eloquence to bear on. the subject of no more str~rig&#xD;
drink, never, he might hope to gain a stray smile froz~&#xD;
my lady - one special nod of approval, o~r one q~1iet.&#xD;

look of gracious approbation, as an all.~sufficient reward&#xD;
for his noble endeavor. Heigh, ho! What a senW&#xD;
mental philosopher I"&#xD;
"Well, my good mentor, is this the head and front of&#xD;
my offense? Yes, no; not all? Well, do you pro-&#xD;
pose exhausting the subject this time, or will we have&#xD;
another sitting ?". 7&#xD;
~" Oh! I just want one question answered, and to give&#xD;
a little seasonable advice ;' and then and then we&#xD;
will sit for your:defense, you know." - .  -&#xD;
"I am your-quiet Ust~ner. Now for. the question.".&#xD;
"Nova Wilmot, do yen not, as we girls say, love&#xD;
Fred Morley? Or, perhaps, 'twill better suit yonr high-&#xD;
toned notions to say, have you not a very high regard&#xD;
for Mr. Morley ?"&#xD;
"Miss Susie Grey, are you my father confessor? If&#xD;
so, perhaps I had better answer, but will insist on that&#xD;
point being settled first."&#xD;
"Most certainly .1 am; and came this morning on&#xD;
purpose to ~onfess yen."&#xD;
"Or to make rue confess; which ?"&#xD;
"I'n~. n~$~ p~ticular which so I get the answer."&#xD;
"Indeed, Miss confessor, I think you are very close&#xD;
with your questions for an introductory sitting."&#xD;
"Oh? you know an open confession is good for the&#xD;
soul; and I like to come directly to. the point .-~ never&#xD;
conid keep a secret- somehow, I always did have to&#xD;
get help .-.and don't like Yankee questioning either. I&#xD;
ju8t want an honest yes or no; that is so short and&#xD;
easy. ]3e a good. girl, Nora, now wont you, for once?"&#xD;
"I have just two objections to answering your ques-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OBJECTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
tion. If I would say yes, then you would open a whole&#xD;
battery of questions, why my present conduct, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
If I say no, you have Yankee -cutiosity enough to&#xD;
shower me with questions of my objections, whys and&#xD;
wherefores, pros and cons, of the whole matter; so I&#xD;
think I cannot confess this morning."&#xD;
"Nova Wilmot, you are just as perverse and unrea-&#xD;
sonable as you can be; you know pa is very favorable4o&#xD;
Fred's suit, and is so delighted to have you receive him&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"I certainly have always treated Mr. Morley with the&#xD;
highest degree of respect."&#xD;
"But that is not going a~ far as pa would like to see&#xD;
you go, you know very well; and he is your guardian."&#xD;
"I think, cousin Susie, I do try to appreciate the&#xD;
kindness of my uncle, your father, in my helpless child~&#xD;
hood and unprotected youtL But I know there are&#xD;
subjects in which he will allow me the privilege of exer-&#xD;
cising my own judgment, and asking for myself."&#xD;
"Oh, yes! Pa thinks you a pevfeet paragon of ex-&#xD;
cellence, and as judgmatical as an old~body. But h~does&#xD;
me the credit of calhin.g me a crazy brain ipsy~ with&#xD;
a deal more taste for nonsense than sober re But I&#xD;
presume he knows best. I'll tell you, cousin Nora, yoa&#xD;
may be glad that I'me not your guardian; if I was,&#xD;
Fred Morley would be my cousin in less than no time;&#xD;
I'd just; say, Miss Nora, prepare for the nuptial-si, and&#xD;
wouldd have to he done; audI don't believe you would&#xD;
ever regret the authority."&#xD;
"If that is your decision I am glad; fot I--do assure&#xD;
you that is a subject I wish the privilege of exegeising&#xD;
my own judgment on, uninfluenced by any authority."&#xD;

THE OBJECTION.            9&#xD;
&#xD;
"And I too; no person would influence me in that&#xD;
matter. I'd jump out of a third story window first.&#xD;
Now that's a happy thought, isn't it? Wouldn't it be&#xD;
romantic, though? To be locked up in a third story&#xD;
room, and let yourself sown by a rope ladder for the&#xD;
only one on earth yo~could love, and 'to be caught in&#xD;
his dear.-. Oh! no matter how, so you didn't get a&#xD;
fall. I do so like a little romance, a good deal of mys-&#xD;
tery, and an ocean of fun. I felt so flat when pa told&#xD;
me and AIf we could get married whenever we wished.&#xD;
I was completely mortified with such tame doings. I&#xD;
wanted to be kept in suspense at least six or twelve&#xD;
months longer, and to wade through difficulties almost&#xD;
insurmountable, and opposition incredible, and to be&#xD;
faithful to the end. Wouldn't it be so very nice to talk&#xD;
of after your wishes were all consummated ?"&#xD;
"Susie, you are like a little parrot; you can talk&#xD;
without thinking."&#xD;
"Just as good luck as any; talk first and think after-&#xD;
wards, that's my motto. how do you like it, Nora&#xD;
Wilmot ?"&#xD;
"Oh I very well; anything to accommodate."&#xD;
a dear, kind, accommodating soul you are;&#xD;
and I do so admire your pe4~uliar mode of accommoda-&#xD;
tion; you agree with your friends in any matter that&#xD;
does not cross your own inclination -but, if your theory&#xD;
of right thinking be departed from, you are off like a&#xD;
tangent. If I were a phrenologist, I would tell you&#xD;
your first visible organ, of organic character, is firmness&#xD;
amounting to obstinacy, and a tenacity of will that will&#xD;
break before bending."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What a beautiful character you are weaving for me,&#xD;
Susie. But I know you always mean well, if you. do&#xD;
say wild things; your faults are all on the surface;&#xD;
away deep, deep down I know there is a fount of pure,&#xD;
holy feeling that will always keep your heart in the right&#xD;
place, with all your gay notions; and do you kn6w&#xD;
I think that is worth all the rest ?"&#xD;
"I don't know just what you think. But I know one&#xD;
thing: I'd like to hand Fred a note saying something&#xD;
to encourage him. Oh! do, Nora. Fred is a noble&#xD;
fellow - full of generous impulses, talented, high-mind-.&#xD;
ed, and the very soul of honor, and very handsome&#xD;
withal - warm-hearted and trusting perhaps to a fault.&#xD;
It was that very trait of character which, although ami-&#xD;
able in itself when connected with a light-hearted dis-&#xD;
position, may be easily led astray, which has betrayed&#xD;
more than one of our most intelligent and talented mem-&#xD;
bers of society into the very excesses your over-fastidi-&#xD;
ous opinions so strenuously condemn in Fred Morley.&#xD;
I have no doubt your influence would do more to correct&#xD;
these youthful excesses than all other influences thrown'&#xD;
together that coulcl~ be brought to bear on his naturally&#xD;
kind and amiable nature. Brother Marsh told me in&#xD;
confidence that Alfred IRayburn had been in several of&#xD;
their convivial parties but I need think nothing of it;&#xD;
young gentlemen would indulge in youthful excesses be-&#xD;
fore marriage; but the duties of married life, and the&#xD;
society of an agreeable, fascinating wife would soon&#xD;
correct all those tendencies, and no doubt entirely reform&#xD;
far worse inebriates than either Fred or Alf. You&#xD;
know they've only been a little derelict in duty-they're&#xD;
not rummies or dram drinkers either, only guilty 'of&#xD;
&#xD;

taking a social glass occasionally. Indeed, II can see no&#xD;
use making such a great ado about so small a matter.&#xD;
If they had been drunk, I shouldn't quiet fancy the idea&#xD;
myself; but I can see no kind of use in magnifying so&#xD;
trifling an error.-it's too much like trying to make a&#xD;
mountain out of. a molehill. Can assure you I am not&#xD;
one iota afraid of my influence; indeedIkindof fancy it&#xD;
would be quite a feather in the cap of any young wife to&#xD;
make her husband better. You know we are said to&#xD;
possess a mighty influence with the sterner sex, and I&#xD;
for one would like to try my influence at home first."&#xD;
"My answer to the note question is, no, Miss, no!&#xD;
My uncle has taken pains~ to have me learn to write&#xD;
myself; and I believe I have not yet forgotten the very&#xD;
useful as well as agreeable art."&#xD;
"But will you promise to exercise your knowledge as&#xD;
I wish you to ?"&#xD;
"If I promise to, I most certainly will perform."&#xD;
"Will you promise ?"&#xD;
"Not yet think I can do better than to make you&#xD;
my father confessor, or negotiator either."&#xD;
"Well, if I don't negotiate a treaty of peace and&#xD;
amity this morning, I shall at least have the sati~facti6n&#xD;
of knowing it isn't my fault. Nora Wilmot, you are a&#xD;
perfect old fogy. Here I have been teasing, an d coax-&#xD;
ing, and persuading, and reasoning with you for one&#xD;
whole precious hour, and don't ~ee myself one step&#xD;
nearer the end than I was at the beginning'; haven't&#xD;
got one word of encouragement yet? Young girls&#xD;
oughtn't be obstinate, never, in any matter; now you&#xD;
see isn'tt at all amiable, or interesting in them. Obsti-&#xD;
nacy is better becoming age and experience."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh! Susie, I don't wish to be at all obstinate; but&#xD;
until you convince me of error7 I don't feel at all war-&#xD;
ranted in changing my opinions. Susie Oreylook at&#xD;
your married acquaintances, and see how many, have re-&#xD;
formed by a matrimonial alliance. Do they not, rune&#xD;
cases out of ten, indulge far more after marriage than&#xD;
before? There is less. restraint in the marriage relation;&#xD;
so if the single gentleman does indulge in outward im-&#xD;
moralities, he knows he will loose influence in female&#xD;
society; if he yields to temptation, or appetite, he en-&#xD;
deavors to be very secret, and the natural impulse of&#xD;
the human heart is averse to restraint in all things."&#xD;
"Oh I you can always find reasons thick as blackber-&#xD;
ries for all your odd notions. And every body knows&#xD;
your opinions are different from any other girl's in&#xD;
Christendom."&#xD;
"Perhaps my opinions do differ from the mass of&#xD;
young ladies educated with the modern standard of&#xD;
morality; they were not received, in the halls of lii~era-&#xD;
ture, but at the bedside of a dying mother, and are too&#xD;
firmly implanted to be easily eradicated."&#xD;
"Oh! won't you tell me all aboi~t your mother,&#xD;
Nora? I only remember her pale ~ce and calm, tear-&#xD;
ful eye when. she died. I recollect thinking she was&#xD;
asleep till ma told me she was dead. But I hardly&#xD;
knew what death meant, although I was twelve years&#xD;
old then. And I remember how still and cold and&#xD;
white her face was as she lay thei~e, with such a quiet&#xD;
smile on her lips. It seems to me now, when I think&#xD;
of her, as she lay in her shroud with the white roses and&#xD;
sweet pinks that ma had put in her hands and strewed&#xD;

12              NOBA WILMOT.                                         THE OBJECTION.            18&#xD;

in her coffin, that she looked just like she had lain down&#xD;
to sweet dreams. But it seemed terrible to be put into&#xD;
the coffin and shut out from the light, and ti~en be cov-&#xD;
ered up in the ground and left all alone. There were&#xD;
weeks afterwards that I shuddered every time I thought&#xD;
of her head resting on the hard boards of the coffin, and&#xD;
no one with her, only the wind stirring the long grass&#xD;
and sighing a funeral anthem to her quiet resting place.&#xD;
Now doesn't it seem sad, Kora, that we must all die,&#xD;
when we are so happy and full of life here; and this&#xD;
world so full of beautiful things? I always think so&#xD;
when I see a dead face beneath the coffin lid it brings&#xD;
death so very near. But I can't feel that I want any&#xD;
better world than this, everything here seems so joyous&#xD;
and full of life think I am quite happy enough here.&#xD;
I have wanted, so many times, to ask you about your&#xD;
ma; but you always look so sad when you talk of her,&#xD;
I wouldn't wound your feelings."&#xD;
"Come to my room some evening, Susie, and I will&#xD;
tell you all I know of my mother's history; her life&#xD;
was full of trials. Her last words to me were: 'Nora,&#xD;
isny daughter, ~f you should reach the years of wornan~&#xD;
hood, use all the in~uence God may ever give you against&#xD;
the vice of intemperance. IRemeinber, 'tis your mother's&#xD;
dying injunction, dearest;' and with one long prayer of&#xD;
holy faith for my misguided father, her spirit took its&#xD;
flight. 'Twas an impressive lesson, Susie, child as I&#xD;
then was. But it was that scene, leaving its impress,&#xD;
that has given my character the appearance of perverse-&#xD;
ness and obstinacy that you so much object to. My&#xD;
motto is, and ever shall be, touch not, taste not, handle&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
not the unclean thing. Woman as I am, I believe, with.&#xD;
entire sincerity, I am responsible for what little influence&#xD;
I may possess, and am resolved it shall all be arrayed&#xD;
on the side of the right."&#xD;
"You must be an out and out woman's rights woman,&#xD;
Kora 1"&#xD;
"I'm not a political woman's rights woman, if I do&#xD;
happen to think we possess some influence in the world,&#xD;
and have some responsibilities. I would not have my&#xD;
own aex enjoy one more political privilege than they do&#xD;
now enjoy; but I would have them use every measure of&#xD;
influence and talent that God has endowed them with&#xD;
against every sin, and vice, and immorality, that lifts its&#xD;
dishonored head and stalks abroad in our land. And I.&#xD;
believe, when woman is thus arrayed on the side of vir-&#xD;
tue and a pure morality in every relation in life, in pub-&#xD;
lic and in private, with an unshrinking adherence, un~&#xD;
swerving in her responsibility, she is in the possession of&#xD;
the ability to correct a preponderating mass of the evils&#xD;
that now afflict society, debasing and destroying so many&#xD;
promising youth just entering the busy scenes of life,&#xD;
with the rainbow of hope gilding the future, casting&#xD;
such a halo of light, and writing golden ballads that only&#xD;
the light of the future may read. If woman does not&#xD;
thus use her influence, sin lieth at her door."&#xD;
"Do you know whaV I am thinking about, cousin&#xD;
Nora ?"&#xD;
"Thinking, perhaps, I haven't quite got you convert-&#xD;
ed yet."&#xD;
"No, not that. I was thinking I wished I could&#xD;
think and talk as you can; but when I do have good&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7669-00000007"/>&#xD;
sognd, logical reasons in my mind, they are all so~con~ -&#xD;
fused it's so hard making myself understoQd expressing~&#xD;
them. Guess I was only intended to talk nonsense 3&#xD;
think I have quite a talent in that way, and can ~exercise&#xD;
to perfection in that line. But as for you, Nora Wjl~..&#xD;
mot, you ought to turn lecturer, and travel the length&#xD;
and breadth of -the land in. the cause of temQerance, or&#xD;
write a book on the subject of special reform; you are&#xD;
so interesting when your feelIngs are enlisted in these&#xD;
subjects, it ;rnakes~ your eyes sparkle with enthusiasm.&#xD;
Now, do you know I don't much likeyour snbliui~the~.&#xD;
oretical, seven-keyed characters, always strun~ip to the&#xD;
highest note, like. ~ome pedantic pedagogue, that can't&#xD;
talk :except by th&amp;amp;n~ost approved rules laid down in the&#xD;
books, and thinks it very sacrilege to indulge in a little&#xD;

forth I design giving you over to obstinacy of will, and&#xD;
when you are an old maid (which I know you will ho)&#xD;
I intend stirring up your pure mind by way of remem-&#xD;
brance. If you should have to dance at fiddler's green,&#xD;
don't be blaming S~usie Grey for it. I can't possibly&#xD;
see why you are so opposed to Fred now, when you used&#xD;
to have so exalted an opinion of his talents."&#xD;
"My opinions have not changed on that subject in the&#xD;
least. I still think him possessed of talents of the very&#xD;
first order; talents that, if not prostrated by seif-indul-&#xD;
p&#xD;
gence, must win him a place among the great ones of&#xD;
* the land. If his moral qualifications are equal to his&#xD;
-mental abilities, he will one day stand in an envied posi~&#xD;
tion, at the very head of the list. But perhaps you forget&#xD;
that that only increases his responsibilities; he has had&#xD;
much given him, and society's claims are only the more&#xD;
exacting. Just in proportion as his brilliant talent and&#xD;
captivating eloquence will ornament society, when prop-&#xD;
erly directed, so would they deform if acted upon by the&#xD;
baser passions. I hope, yes, I ardently wish; Fred may&#xD;
be all that is good, and noble, and pure ~- all that I&#xD;
once thought him. But I don't more than half like the&#xD;
reports we have had of late, they come too well authen-&#xD;
ticated, coupled, as they have been, with personal obser-&#xD;
vations. Time alone can determine their truth or falsi-&#xD;
ty. But do you know, Susie, you have forced me into&#xD;
Saying all this, that I didn't intend saying? You fairly&#xD;
teased me into it, against my better judgment."&#xD;
"Oh I I am so glad you did say it; I wanted so much&#xD;
to know whether you appreciated Fred's character as I&#xD;
I do, or not. Now I have a hope that you will some&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
day be Mrs. Fred Morley; for I really haven't one fear&#xD;
but that Fred will be a sober fellow yet, one of the strict&#xD;
sort I expect. He has too much good sense and self~&#xD;
respect to mar his prospects for lifer and disappoint the&#xD;
expectation of his friends. And I have no doubt your&#xD;
influence would soon check and overcome every tempta-&#xD;
tion to irregularity."&#xD;
"But~ I tell you, Madam champion, once for all, I&#xD;
never intend to make the trial. If your better judgment&#xD;
teaches you it is best, and you are willing to make the&#xD;
trial, I. have no quarrel with you on the subject. But&#xD;
this much I will say, I think it is a risk such as I am not&#xD;
willing to encounter. My stakes are set; thus far will&#xD;
I go and no farther."&#xD;
"I say so much, for all that; and presume 'twill all&#xD;
break without bending at that. You talk about my&#xD;
better judgment, cousin Nora. Don't you know I have&#xD;
no better judgment? I just take a fancy into my head,&#xD;
dignify it with the title of an idea, or a principle, and&#xD;
so it goes; perhaps some other fancy takes its place in&#xD;
another hour, and the old one is cast off or forgotten.&#xD;
If I speak, or act, ten to one it was prompted by a. mere&#xD;
impulse of the moment; and now you want me to have&#xD;
credit for better judgment; that seems too serious aud&#xD;
sedate I'm startled by the mere announcement. .Bnt&#xD;
do you know the fancy strikes me just now that L shall&#xD;
marry Alf after all ?"&#xD;

TWO OHARACT3R8.              19&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
TWO CHARACTERS.&#xD;
Perhaps, according to the usages of polite society,&#xD;
our readers woi~ld like an introduction to the two very&#xD;
interesting young ladies to whom they have been listen-&#xD;
ing so long, whose pleasant tete-a-tete forms the first&#xD;
chapter of our story.&#xD;
Miss Susie Grey, then, the youngest, the smallest,&#xD;
and by far the prettiest, as the world says, is the only&#xD;
daughter of one of our most successful attorneys arid&#xD;
politicians, with &amp;amp; A'orehead not very classical, hair soft&#xD;
and sunshiny, that waved and danced in careless negli-&#xD;
gence, never permitted to be still long enough to know&#xD;
whether it was straight or curling by nature, whether a&#xD;
dark auburn or an undefined brown, by the restless little&#xD;
head, that didn't seem to know it was ever designed to&#xD;
be still. A figure moulded, as many other young ladies'&#xD;
figures have been, rather below than above middle size,&#xD;
and a very little inclined to plumpness, which the fairy&#xD;
little beauty declared was the .only fault she possessed.&#xD;
True, her teeth were not always quite pearly white, but&#xD;
then she could polish them; a beautifully rounded arm,&#xD;
and such a dimple of a hand, it was almost bewitching&#xD;
in its snowy whiteness; but the tiny little feet and grace-&#xD;
ful uncle more than all else told of aristocratic blood.&#xD;
We had almost forgotten the witch of a mouth, with the&#xD;
p~iting lips, that smiled with such a childish grace, and&#xD;
the countenance so full of animation and unaffected sim-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
'4,&#xD;
~.&#xD;
&#xD;
plicity. Eyes, oh, yes I who ever heard of a beauty&#xD;
without brilliant eyes, those windows of the soul? How&#xD;
much of true character may be read there! But Susie&#xD;
Grey's eyes were not jet black, nor a beautiful hazel&#xD;
either, as many other beauties have been, but the ~clearest&#xD;
blue imaginable; yes, a laughing blue eye, that show-&#xD;
ed whatever mood the ingenuous countenance wore, laugh-&#xD;
ing long after the dimpled cheeks and pouting lips were&#xD;
at rest, if they ever did rest.&#xD;
The girls at school called her romping Susie. She&#xD;
always was more of a favorite with her schoolmates&#xD;
than her teachers; nature possessed more attractions for&#xD;
her lively, joyous being than a dull schoolroom, or a&#xD;
hug line of unintelligible figures; 'aiid if she happened&#xD;
to hear a bird singing over her head, or chanced to eli-&#xD;
counter a gay butterfly, dancing and flitting in the sun-&#xD;
shine, 'twas a better apology~ for a poor recitation than&#xD;
any want of natural talent. She had told cousin Nora&#xD;
a thousand 'times she couldn't see how she could set&#xD;
poking over old musty books all day long and the sun-&#xD;
shine so inviting; she believed in enjoying life wbile she&#xD;
could; let them be learned who were willing to i~ke the&#xD;
sacrifice. Mathematics she thought did very well for&#xD;
gentlemen that expected to be accountants or teachers;&#xD;
hit she couldn't see any benefit it' would possibly be to&#xD;
her; she never expected to sell anything, and when she&#xD;
bought a*iything the shopkeeper always made out the&#xD;
bill. As for the abstruse scieiices~ abe knew nothing&#xD;
about them, they were a perfect br&amp;amp;d~et of mysteries;&#xD;
wouldd be worth an attack of dyspepsia to any young&#xD;
lady,, except cousin Nora, to get through with the intro-&#xD;

ductory chapter. Then there was history; what cared she&#xD;
whether Darius, the Medo-Persian, overrun the whole&#xD;
Babylonish Empire or not, or what kind of laws Lycur-&#xD;
gus made for the Spartans. But ~dl that was better&#xD;
than a continued routine of war, wa~r, war; how many&#xD;
soldier~General Somebody had to de eat General Some-&#xD;
body else, and how many were ~left dead on the field.&#xD;
Susie doesn't think war, or fighting either, so very inter-&#xD;
esting that we need take so much p~ins to learn about&#xD;
it; it's all a farce after all. Now m~isic she does like;&#xD;
there is so much life in the harmony ~f sweet sounds, it&#xD;
chords so well with her lively fancy; and dancing is its&#xD;
counterpart no young lady can co sider herself edu-&#xD;
cated withotit these accomplishments and French, oh,&#xD;
yes! her French lessons were never dii 1; she thinks time&#xD;
well spent acquiring such accomplish ments - it makes&#xD;
young ladies pass so much better in so iety. Miss Susie&#xD;
thinks a young lady's education entir ly unfinished that&#xD;
can only converse in one language, she would much&#xD;
rather give up all the solid portion of her education,&#xD;
and it had cost a vast deal of labor .nd vexation, than&#xD;
to be deprived of the ornamental pai~t of her qualifica~&#xD;
tions. Then there is painting - how nice it is to imi-&#xD;
tate nature in her most beautiful moo~s; she is thank-&#xD;
ful that she excels in that accomplishment; her m~&#xD;
thinks she paints quite equal to her teacher already;&#xD;
she intends to practice that branch of education in mar-&#xD;
ried life just as much as in single. She intends surpri-&#xD;
sing Alfred by producing a, piece to grace her own par-&#xD;
lor, that she will; she'll not do like so many girls, lay&#xD;
aside her books and study as soon as she takes upon her-&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
self the title of Mrs., not she. Alas! poor Susie! alas!&#xD;
for the day-dreams of life.&#xD;
Judge Grey, though really an indulgent parent,'wish-&#xD;
ing to do all that money could do to give his children&#xD;
every advantage of education and influence, was not&#xD;
aware that teachers and governesses cannot supply the&#xD;
deficiency of a negligent parental trai~Ang. When he be-&#xD;
lieved his petted daughter thoroughly well educated, she&#xD;
had only a mere outside garnish, a smatterAng of any-&#xD;
thing really useful, as we have seen; her own inclination&#xD;
having governed her course of study. He was too much&#xD;
occupied with either business or politics to attend to the&#xD;
minutia of her studies, and had left the most important&#xD;
earthly duty that could devolve upon a parent to the&#xD;
care of another. Her mother having been educated in&#xD;
much the same manner as. her daughter, really thought&#xD;
her daughter's elegant accomplishments quite entirely&#xD;
sufficient to fit her for any station in life. So Miss Su-&#xD;
sie, naturally kind-hearted, generous and amiable, if her&#xD;
better qualities had been cultivated, was left to meet the&#xD;
frowns and rebuffs of the world-to learn by sad expe-&#xD;
rience that the world has any reality, and life is not en-&#xD;
tirely made up of sunshine and moonbeams.&#xD;
Miss Kora Wilmot, (we will premise that our present&#xD;
character is one of those to whom we instinctively apply&#xD;
the title of Miss, almost without knowing the reason&#xD;
why, only we feel a little deferential, and not caring to&#xD;
prove our reason,) Miss Nora was not half so pretty&#xD;
(as we before said) as Susie Grey; no person ever&#xD;
thought of calling her pretty, but she certainly may be&#xD;
called haiidsome. If abroad, expansive forehead, dark, in-&#xD;

tellectual eyes, and a countenance in which dignity and&#xD;
intelligence blended, without very regular features, can&#xD;
lay claim to that title, she certainly possessed it.&#xD;
Most persons think her very~ wel~ looking, but it is&#xD;
not beauty of person that is the charm of attraction in&#xD;
Miss Wilmot. While very many 0ther young ladies&#xD;
were spending their time enjoying l~fe, as they termed&#xD;
it, and dignifying her v~ith the title of Mrs. Bluestocking,&#xD;
Old Poky, &amp;amp;c., Nora had been quietly and unobtrusively&#xD;
laying the foundations of a most liberal and thoroughly&#xD;
cultivated mind, and fitting herself for future usefulness&#xD;
in a society that is in so great a need of the influence&#xD;
and services of an innumerable number of just such charm&#xD;
actors h~4ies of a cultivated liberality of sentiment,&#xD;
and a moral courage to meet the ultraist of all senti-&#xD;
ments on the broad ground of an aristocracy of purely&#xD;
moral worth, uninfluenced by wealth or station. What&#xD;
cared Nora for school-girl names? If cousin Susie did&#xD;
call her old granny, old fogy, and all the rest, she&#xD;
still pursued the course marked out for herself with an&#xD;
unwavering firmness. She had become perfectly accus-&#xD;
tomed to the title of conventional, for Susie had told her&#xD;
so many times she was the most conventional .thing she&#xD;
ever saw-~-~ perfectly set in her ways, an old niaid 'with~&#xD;
out a doubt, or she's no prophet, and all that. Still Nora&#xD;
did not change her purpose, but went on her way, and&#xD;
was, after all, a universal favorite in society. The young&#xD;
liked her because she was so kind and accommodating,&#xD;
and they felt a deference such as is always felt for a su-&#xD;
periority of mind wherever we meet it, and she possess-&#xD;
ed an influence even over the gay, volatile Susie that she&#xD;
was not at all aware of.&#xD;
&#xD;
TWO OHA1LAOTI~RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
The more sedate portion of society welcomed her as&#xD;
one of its ornaments, because she could suit herself to&#xD;
society in all its moods, from grave to gay, and was&#xD;
possessed of a fund of intelligence not always to be met&#xD;
with in fashionable society, especially among boarding-&#xD;
school educated young ladies, and possessed withal a&#xD;
truly good heart, united to a more than, ordinary refine-&#xD;
ment of intellect and energy, but at the same time pure-&#xD;
ly womanly sympathies and affections. Placing her&#xD;
mark of excellence very high, she possessed The perse-&#xD;
verance and energy to attain the exalted standard with-&#xD;
out so much as shrinking from the task, self-inflicted&#xD;
though it was; but Nora's was a deep, rare, noble na-&#xD;
ture, capable, too, of comprehending her obligations to&#xD;
society; her head had not been educated and her heart&#xD;
le~ waste. No, no; the issues of the heart, the pas-&#xD;
~ions, affections, aiid sensibilities, all the utterances of&#xD;
the inner life, had been carefully trained to fit it for its&#xD;
noble, immortal destiny. There was an open frankness,&#xD;
a freedom and urbanity in her manner, an easy ~sociality&#xD;
which would seem to encourage conversation without&#xD;
inviting familiarity.&#xD;
But we are not claiming perfection as a part of our&#xD;
heroine's appendages; very few of the daughters of our&#xD;
fallen progenitors can boast that truly desirable qualifi-&#xD;
cation. We have only endeavored to give the impres-&#xD;
sion that Nora has, perhaps, fewer faults and more ster-&#xD;
ling virtues than. we meet in the every-day, walks of&#xD;
society; we didn't just say she is the perfection of ele-&#xD;
gance, only verging very, nearly.&#xD;

MORLEY AND RAYBU~N.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
FRED MORLEY AND ALFRED RAYBURN.&#xD;
The slant rays of a bright December sun, reflected&#xD;
from a thousand spires of dazzling white, irradiating&#xD;
and shedding almost a summer-like cheerfulness through&#xD;
the open casement, alighted on a beautiful rose gera-&#xD;
nium and~ mountain pink, that sat so cosily wooing the&#xD;
furtive sunshine, just within the casement, as if in very&#xD;
mockery at the dazzling robe of white ermine that cov-&#xD;
ered all nature's surroundings without, in the bachelor&#xD;
sanctum of our two friends, whom we wish to introduce&#xD;
to the acquaintance of our readers.&#xD;
A lounge covered with crimson damask, two lazily&#xD;
cushioned ~arm chairs, a' writing desk, and a table cov-&#xD;
ered with writing material, and an open grate filled with&#xD;
burning anthracite, which glowed and danced in such&#xD;
fantastic glee as to dissipate every vestige of wintry in-&#xD;
fluence, that might else have pervaded this truly de-&#xD;
lightful sanctum of bachelorism. On a little closer in-&#xD;
spection, we find two rather interesting looking person-&#xD;
ages as occupants. Fred Morley, who has thrown him-&#xD;
self upon the lounge, lying in a half musing, half revery,&#xD;
and occasionally puffing a delicate little Principe, and&#xD;
watching the smoke curling in graceful wreaths above&#xD;
his head, and settling in fantastic shapes on the ceiling&#xD;
above, so like the bright day-dreams of life.&#xD;
Fred was descended from Colonel Morley, a member&#xD;
of one of the colonial congresses, that had taken so de-&#xD;
&#xD;
cided a stand against British usurpation, in the times&#xD;
that tried men's patriotism. His father, a leading mem-&#xD;
ber of an extensive mercantile establishment, had sud-&#xD;
denly found his circumstances embarrassed beyond im-&#xD;
mediate relief, by one of those too frequent changes in&#xD;
the financial world, denominated a moneyed pressure,&#xD;
just at the time his son had closed his college studies,&#xD;
and was prepared to enter a law school, preparative to&#xD;
embarking in the legal profession. Fred; with charac-&#xD;
teristic generosity, proposed turning his attention to&#xD;
some business of immediate profit, to assist his father in&#xD;
extricating himself fron  present embarrassment. But&#xD;
his father, too proud even in his poverty to depend upon&#xD;
his son in any degree, felt almost piqued with the offer,&#xD;
but was at the same time constrained, entirely from ne-&#xD;
cessity, to cast his talented son entirely upon his own&#xD;
exertions for future prospects. This circumstance,&#xD;
although it cost the indulgent father, with his worldly&#xD;
proud nature, a severe heart-struggle, had been of an&#xD;
incalculable advantage to the son, by drawing forth&#xD;
many a latent energy that had hitherto lain dormant, or&#xD;
been turned only to trifling uses, only because not im-&#xD;
mediately in requisition. Morley, in person, was what the&#xD;
girls would call the very beau ideal of a gentleman.&#xD;
How noble' Fred was in person; tail, too, and very&#xD;
straight, with so well knit, elastic a figure, whose every&#xD;
movement was characterized by a manly energy and&#xD;
grace, and a step, light, elastic, yet firm and command-&#xD;
ing; high, expansive forehead, slightly shaded by hair&#xD;
of a glossy black; eyes rather deep set, that seemed to&#xD;
rest in a dreamy thoughtfulness when the countenance.&#xD;

all around the corners of the mouth; set off by a&#xD;
perfectly free, open, manly countenance, hut where in-&#xD;
tellect and intelligence formed the most prominent sur-&#xD;
roundings. The inner man -those diviner parts, con-&#xD;
science, sentiment and affection; those higher facul-&#xD;
ties which tend rather to weaken the ~1ements of success&#xD;
in the outward world-were not wanting in Fred Mor-&#xD;
ley, only tempered by the outward furnishings of a&#xD;
perfectly easy manner and ready presence of mind under&#xD;
exigencies, and a quick appreh~usion of the active and&#xD;
practical elements of success, so essential to popular&#xD;
favor. An open, frank, off-hand manner, united to an&#xD;
air of refined gentility, forming, altogether, the outward&#xD;
appearing of a character of no ordinary mould. But&#xD;
then there was a strongly, impulsive temperament;&#xD;
lively, social tendencies that were prone to yield too&#xD;
easily to the first impulse of the moment,. even again~V&#xD;
the urgent warnings of a better judgment, that hidden&#xD;
dangers might lurk beneath.&#xD;
Our other character, figuring now on the stage of&#xD;
active dramatic life, may be introduced as Alfred Ray-&#xD;
burn, Esq., quite-entIrely in very many respects-the&#xD;
very opposite of our last described character. In per-&#xD;
sot, Alfred is below middle size, light built, with a&#xD;
quick; almost nervous step,, strongly indicative' of a&#xD;
highly: nervous temperament, with a quick, punctilious&#xD;
sense of honor. His forehead is not particularly im-&#xD;
pressive, the light, brown hair marking the outlines ra-&#xD;
ther indefinitely, with .a clear, sharp, hazel eye, of a&#xD;
restless brilliance. But the mouth didn't harmonize&#xD;

personal embellishment Dame Nature had endowed him&#xD;
with, Fred Morley had told him his mouth looked&#xD;
as if it was just ready to say something vastly knowing,&#xD;
whenever its possessor was willing to grant the liberty.&#xD;
Rayburn's nature was impulsive, imaginative and ardent,&#xD;
restless under restraint,. nclining constantly to generous&#xD;
extremes, with a passioii~te devotion to whatever his&#xD;
naturally truthful nature ,presented for consideration.&#xD;
Ideality was almost an absorbing 'principle of his men-&#xD;
tal furnishing, and would have made him perhaps too fas-&#xD;
tidious, but for a strong da8h. of self-adulation, united&#xD;
to a warm, social inclination, leading its possessor into&#xD;
frequent difficulties, for the mere want of a little more&#xD;
firmness of purpQse. iRayburn had, no negative princi-&#xD;

encouraging? Any kind of intention of~ putting in a&#xD;
claim for Judgeship, or intend to commence at a more&#xD;
subordinate station, for the honor of a gradual rise? or&#xD;
will you eschew politics, and plant all your seeds of&#xD;
success in the bar alone? Why, man, if I possessed&#xD;
such a figure and personal appearance, united to your&#xD;
command of talent and popularity, I should make no&#xD;
calculatioii of stopping short of a berth at Washington.&#xD;
Don't you even now, my dear fellow, have some day-&#xD;
dreams of senatorial life, or of a term in the White&#xD;
House ?"&#xD;
"You are an ambitious fellow, Rayburn; why don't&#xD;
you try your own luck in politics? I fancy your man-&#xD;
ner would be far more popular with the "v~ox popul~".&#xD;
than mine ever will be. Your gay, light, volatile&#xD;
position and temperament, and your very happy faculty&#xD;
for accommodating yourself to the necessities of every&#xD;
emergency, will go vastly farther than any little differ-&#xD;
ence of person or figure you may fancy me in possession&#xD;
of. I tell you, these mere externals are of little mo-&#xD;
ment. As for advantages, I am of opinion the prepon-&#xD;
derance is entirely on your side, sir; for I happen to be&#xD;
identified with the party in politics that is not at all in&#xD;
the ascendant at the present time, and, unless some -very&#xD;
unforeseen change, some sudden shifting of the cards&#xD;
in political trickery or party chicanery, such as have not&#xD;
been used since the days of great Roman pr~etorshi~, or&#xD;
&#xD;
the rupturing of the wheels of state in the old Grecian&#xD;
republic, I fancy there is little danger of it drifting up-&#xD;
ward very soon."&#xD;
"Well, Morley, if I were ~. member of your party, I&#xD;
should never once think of waiting for a rise in so&#xD;
doubtful a market; I would just be suddenly converted&#xD;
to the other side; turn my coat t'other side out, and&#xD;
come floating up on the stream of popularity, as natu-&#xD;
rally as if it had been the waters in which I had been&#xD;
always used to floating."&#xD;
But what would you do, if you could not, for the&#xD;
life of you, bring your conscience and feelings to believe&#xD;
that the right side of the question, for the good of the&#xD;
country ?"&#xD;
"Good of the country, conscience, feelings, and all&#xD;
that! Why, man, I just call conscience a very crotchety&#xD;
thing, very like a wet buck-skin string, that may be very&#xD;
easily stretched, to suit each maj.i's practical necessities.&#xD;
Why, old boy, more than one-half the hypocritical cant&#xD;
about conscience, and all that, is mere humbuggery in&#xD;
the extreme. I never expect to lose my popularity for&#xD;
any such trash; 'tis only such stuff as dreams are made of.&#xD;
Yetlamnotan unbeliever; I believe there issuch~&#xD;
thing as conscience&amp;amp; But it should only govern our re-&#xD;
ligious opinions; if we are going to bring it to bear on&#xD;
every event in life, and make it an apology for every&#xD;
disappointment we meet with, we certainly are in dan-&#xD;
ger of destroying the solemnities of religious obliga-&#xD;
tions and trusts. Let your conscience be at rest until&#xD;
your coat is entirely turned, sleeves and all, and then&#xD;
make it a most extreme matter of conscience to 0tick&#xD;
toyoar.part~v."&#xD;

'Well, my very sage friend, suppose, just for .argn..&#xD;
metit sake, we let the conscience case rest as if 'tWere&#xD;
settled. Then next comes up the objection of' honor.&#xD;
I don't more than half like the title of turn-coat. I&#xD;
always felt a pride in sticking' to a party, or to a set of&#xD;
principles, on the broad basis of a conviction that they&#xD;
are genuinely right, founded on the great laws of uni-&#xD;
versal good, and not merely because they answered the&#xD;
ends of one party, or subserved the ambitious purposes&#xD;
of a particular set of men, even though I myself might&#xD;
thereby turn up on the mipopMlar side of the wheel' of&#xD;
fortune, as at th&amp;amp; present juncture o~ affairs~ Why,&#xD;
sir, I don't think I would be' successful; don't so much&#xD;
as believe I could even make a successful speech, (al..&#xD;
though you have done me the. extreme honor t~ call me&#xD;
eloquent, believe that was it; 'just so, sir,') if I could&#xD;
not argue my own sentiments. I must be sincere if I&#xD;
am successful; must believe myself."&#xD;
"Pahi man, what positive absurdity, binding down&#xD;
your fine genius, too, with such shilly-shally notions.&#xD;
Besides, my good fellow, I am vastly fearful you will&#xD;
find your fine-spun theory considerably in the way of your&#xD;
success as an attorney; fancy you will be under the ixe~&#xD;
cessity of trimming off some 'of the most prominent&#xD;
edges of your too fastidious conscience before you can&#xD;
possibly expect to plead one case in every twent~ that&#xD;
comes within the jurisdiction of a court of judiebture~&#xD;
You will be bound~ continually to taking one-sided&#xD;
views of the matter before you, and to sustain' your&#xD;
client's cause, right or wrong. But j~erhaps you are&#xD;
going to always think your side is right, and fight accor-&#xD;
dingly ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, sir, your opinions notwithstanding to the con.-&#xD;
tray, i tu~i very enthusiastic in. the beliet' that I can&#xD;
practice law, with at least a tolerable degree of success,&#xD;
and that, too, without doing much violence to my fe&amp;amp;l-&#xD;
ings, or opinions either. I can't understand a necessity&#xD;
for an attorney endeavoring to make a wrong right, or&#xD;
a right wrong, because he has undertaken to defend one&#xD;
side of a particular cage. IL only understand that he&#xD;
engages to use his utmost ability to procure justice un-&#xD;
der the law, for his client; not to pervert or bend, or&#xD;
cover the law; only to see that his client has the full&#xD;
advantage of ~ts protection in his particular case."&#xD;
"Well, Morley, you may get along in that kind of&#xD;
wholesale conscientiouss manner, in the practice, with suc-&#xD;
cess, bu4really, I think IL should fail. For my own part, I&#xD;
expect to go in for the surest road to eminence; to make&#xD;
black white, or white black, if I can, you know; and&#xD;
we will prove which is the most direct road to success.&#xD;
I have a very great mind to make my mark in the&#xD;
world; to let at least some of the inhabitants know that&#xD;
Rayburn is here. I believe, sir, we are the arbiters of&#xD;
our own fortunes, and I intend to make a very strong&#xD;
effort to arbitrate mine about right. I 'have thought,&#xD;
too, we are not aware of the one-half that is within us;&#xD;
if we were fully conscious of all our inward endow-&#xD;
ments, the true elements of successful effort, a kind of&#xD;
inspiration, or magnetism, or mysterious elemental in-&#xD;
fluence, we' are susceptible of a vast improvement. I&#xD;
believe, too," and Rayburn's whole figure seemed to di-&#xD;
late with the enthusiasm of the thought, as he rose and&#xD;

cast from the divine mould, is a rare gem of almost ex-&#xD;
quisite workmanship and beauty; capable of sending&#xD;
forth such an oat-flashing, sparkling, corruscant light&#xD;
of kindled genius, as would ~completely surprise our&#xD;
poor earth-plodding efforts. But we let our best gifts&#xD;
be inactive, sometimes alp~ost. dormant, for want of ex-&#xD;
ercising &amp;amp; sufficient degree of mental activity and&#xD;
alertness. Now, sir, the gre~tt heaven-born gift of elo-&#xD;
quence, after all, is about one~half the child of cultiva-&#xD;
tion-if we only possess a lively imagination, an enthu-&#xD;
~iastic temperament, and a little taste for the pathetic&#xD;
and a touch of the tragic, and are imbued with a&#xD;
thorough sense of the beautiful in nature, and then&#xD;
dovetail them all together, using perseverance as an ad-&#xD;
hesive plaster to cement and unite the whole conglom-&#xD;
erated mass, instead of wasting our glorious gifts and&#xD;
energies~ in the grand pursuit of gain, gain, and that&#xD;
gain only a mere dross that must perish with the usiug.&#xD;
As for wealth, that is a matter of almost entire indiffer-&#xD;
ence to me, only so far as the possession of it is essen-&#xD;
tial to success, in other points of view. But I almost&#xD;
worship honor; I believe I possess more than an ordi-&#xD;
nary ambition to be great. Oh! I would like with&#xD;
Byron,&#xD;
"To call the stars my own,&#xD;
And with the thunder talk familiarly,&#xD;
As friend to friend;"&#xD;
or to hold an audience spell-bound, entranced, with such&#xD;
magic bursts of eloquence, and glowing thoughts of&#xD;
imagery, as never fell from mortal lips before. If I&#xD;
don't make a great man, sir it shall never be for the&#xD;
want of either effort or perseverance; and as for talent,&#xD;
&#xD;
I fancy myself in possession of a pretty fair proportion&#xD;
of even that very essential element of such success as I&#xD;
am ambitious of attaining."&#xD;
"Ho, ho! what an ambitious enthusiast you are, iRay-&#xD;
burn! Shall I tell you what I see, wanting in your men-&#xD;
tal furnishing ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, sir, certainly; that's just what I want&#xD;
to know; want to see myself. as other men see me."&#xD;
"If you have so very great an ambition to be en-&#xD;
rolled among the great ones of earth, and to stand&#xD;
among the honored ones at the very top of the pinnacle&#xD;
of fame, or to be able to hold an audience enchained~ or&#xD;
to carry them with you, like an Alpine torrent, foaming,&#xD;
dashing and sweeping, in one grand display of sublimity&#xD;
and eloquence,-"&#xD;
".And be at last dissolved in mist and spray at the&#xD;
bottom, on the rock of common sense, I surmise ~&#xD;
"No innuendoes, if you please, Mr. Rayburn; none at&#xD;
all, sir. If these are to be the objects of your sublime&#xD;
adoration, and you are going to bow down and worship&#xD;
fame, you must set your mark of excellence and attain-&#xD;
ment very high; no danger of getting it any too high.&#xD;
Then you want full and entire faith, without ever a&#xD;
wavering doubt, in your own ability to attain that stand-&#xD;
ard. Remember, when you distrust, you very soon&#xD;
disbelieve; there is but a balf step between the two&#xD;
ideas. Make popular favor the factotum of your exist-&#xD;
ence, and study human nature as you would a favorite&#xD;
book; and, above all else, be firm in every purpose in&#xD;
life; never vacillate or turn from your purpose for dis-&#xD;
appointments or discouragements, but only look ahead&#xD;

all else, erect a wall of moral excellence as a defense&#xD;
against temptations that will beset your pathway in the&#xD;

"Why1 Fred, you seem almost sage like."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; almost a lion in my way; ~don't I, now?"&#xD;
"But, but, sir, ~'ou haven't touched the most interest-&#xD;
ing subject yet; you did well, admirably well, as far&#xD;
as you went; but you didn't get quite through with all&#xD;
the advice I was expecting to hear."&#xD;
"Ha, ha! my good fellow, I guess you didn't stand&#xD;
in need of any advice on the subject of the grand&#xD;
matter of all the step 'matrimonial, I presume, was&#xD;
what you were meaning. If Madame fl~umor is not&#xD;
sadly at fault, I presume, at least, you were done, bar-&#xD;
gained, sold, and well nigh ready to be delivered."&#xD;
"Ahi think so, indeed ?"&#xD;
"Ah, yes, sir! believe so, indeed; and must do you&#xD;
the credit to admire your taste for the really beautiful&#xD;
in nature. And to congratulate you, likewise, in you~&#xD;
success where so many have failed."&#xD;
"My warmest thanks, sir," and iRayburn bowed very&#xD;
low, as he stroked his mustache, with evident satisfae-&#xD;
tion, quite flattered by the compliment to his betrothed.&#xD;
"Then you do admire Miss Susie ?"&#xD;
"Her person, most certainly; she is, perhaps, a little&#xD;
too pettit for perfection, to my taste; but the extreme&#xD;
animation and varied humor of her countenance is al-&#xD;
most bewitching; it reminds one of a shower of sun-&#xD;
beams on a bed of roses covered with dew-drops, with&#xD;
&#xD;
the light of her' 'May-blue eyes,' and sunnyhair. And&#xD;
the little graceful figure, almost ethereal! couldn't help&#xD;
admiring it, if 'twere only as a specimen of Nature~s&#xD;
handiwork. She almost fills one's ideas of a fairy or a&#xD;
sprite. And the little vixen is just as full of life as the&#xD;
countenance is of animation. There is no still life&#xD;
about her, I assure you; she is one of the fleecy sort,&#xD;
and breezy as a summer's day; never gloomy and taci-&#xD;
turn, like your solid sort, with a heart large and roomy,&#xD;
just like a girl of sixteen ought t~ have. Now, I like&#xD;
your go-ahead girls, never still more than so long 8&#xD;
time; and Susie has such a quick turn; always some-&#xD;
thing to suit every occasion; and she sings and dances&#xD;
exquisitely."&#xD;
"Well, my man, how goes the affairs of the heart&#xD;
with you, now-a-days? Laid the free-will offering of&#xD;
your heart, hand, and very best talents at the feet of&#xD;
Miss Nora Wilmot, hey? all freely offered without any&#xD;

"Yes, sir, and rejected at that; cast off as unworthy."&#xD;
"Too late in the day, I presume; some other favored&#xD;

found wanting in my lady's opinion."&#xD;

&#xD;
veritable matter of fact-a plain, true statement, if you&#xD;
please; 'a plain, unvarnished tale.' Perhaps the inat~&#xD;
ter does need some explanation."&#xD;
"Most certainly it does; for J can't think I was mis-&#xD;
taken in the fact that Miss Wilmot was well pleased&#xD;
with you last summer, and received your attentions very&#xD;
graciously."&#xD;
"You recollect, IR~yburn, we were told that Miss&#xD;
Wilinot had made an unqualified declaration against any&#xD;
and all-what shall I call them ?.-.why, tipplers; that is&#xD;
just it; using the creature, in any degree, must be tip-&#xD;
pling; that is as soft a term as it deserves. Well,&#xD;
Miss Wilmot has taken an oath in her way, upon the&#xD;
altar of temperance, and considers herself bound, as&#xD;
inviolable as if by the laws of the Medes and Persians,&#xD;
against everything that is anti-temperate; does not&#xD;
even wish to receive the attentions of any gentleman&#xD;
that does in any way countenance the traffic."&#xD;
"Oh! I knew that was said, but had no kind of idea&#xD;
that she would stand to it, or act on such a declaration.&#xD;
I have known a great many young ladies that professed&#xD;
to be Daughters of Temperance, that seemed to have&#xD;
very little objection to a fellow's getting quite happy&#xD;
occasionally; they would receive his attentions just. as&#xD;
graciously afterwards as before. Miss Wilmot must&#xD;
have heard of some of our grand exploits, this winter,&#xD;
Fred; our little adventure down at S-, perhaps;&#xD;
that wouldn't set at all well on her stomach~ I fancy.&#xD;
And the sleigh ride to Brandon's-.--wonder how she'd&#xD;
like the complexion of that? And I do wonder how&#xD;
the girls would have liked our dancing, nimble go-jims,&#xD;
&#xD;
down at Jake Rance's saloon? Bah! it's all perfect&#xD;
flummery; just a mere flasji of exquisite prudery, done*&#xD;
for mere effect. I'll lay a wager, sir, and agree to pay&#xD;
it in brandy, that Nora WilMot marries a drunkard yet.&#xD;
I never ~saw it miss in my life. These extreme people&#xD;
always do just what they are contending against the&#xD;
strongest."&#xD;
"I am of opinion you. do Miss Wilmot an injustice,&#xD;
a great injustice, Mr. Rayburn, for I believe she is sin-&#xD;
cere, perfectly sincere, and acts in good faith; and I be-&#xD;
lieve, furthermore, that if every lady, old and young,&#xD;
in the land, would take the same ground, and carry it&#xD;
out consistently, they would do vastly more than we&#xD;
men have ever succeeded in accomplishing, towards rid-&#xD;
ding the world of this nefarious traffic, this soul-and-&#xD;
body-destroying agency, that ought to have been ban-&#xD;
ished to the drear domains of Pluto a thousand years&#xD;
ago, where I'm sadly afraid its manufacturers, vendors&#xD;
and consumers will all have to go, unless they abandon&#xD;
their course and. repent of the evil they have done."&#xD;
"One convert, then, I presume, to Miss Kora's&#xD;
theory; didn't suppose you would be so very easily con-&#xD;
verted~ 6r render so ready obedience to female dic-&#xD;
tation."&#xD;
"I didn't just quite say I was a convert; did I, my&#xD;
good sir? ~3ut, I can tell you, I rather think several&#xD;
of us need converting, even if female influence should&#xD;
be the instrument used for its accomplishment."&#xD;
"Well, sir, such things may take with some men; but&#xD;
I can tell~, you very frankly, Fred Morley, if Susie Grey&#xD;
would come cooing and purring around me after that&#xD;

fashion, you'd very soon see one di~'gusted lover, at all&#xD;

me. II never make any calculations on the subject of&#xD;
being a drinking character anyhow, and intend, honestly&#xD;
intend, to drop the whole business as soon as ever I am&#xD;
married; think I have more principle than to wound&#xD;
the feelings of any woman by such indulgence; I would&#xD;
scorn such an act; and believe Susie has too much&#xD;
confidence to fear to trust me; and I intend to prove&#xD;
her confidence not misapplied. But, Fred, you can&#xD;
find plenty of girls just as pretty as Miss INora, and&#xD;
not half so fastidious, both ready and willing. 'There&#xD;
is just as good fish in the sea as ever were caught."'&#xD;
"Well, Rayburn, IL have my opinions, and you have&#xD;
yours; and it is our privilege, each one, to think for&#xD;
ourselves.. My opinion is, that it is 'not only the privi-&#xD;
lege, but the duty, of every lady, as she may value her&#xD;
future p1~ospects and happiness, to look well to her.&#xD;
choice in marriage:; and as drunkenness must necessarily&#xD;
destroy every ray of prospect for happiness, or even&#xD;
peace, in any~ family that is cursed with its unhallowed&#xD;

ing shrubs of our own favor~J clime; borrowing half&#xD;
their nourishment and life from their proximity to&#xD;
nature's source of propagation, as they sat wooing the&#xD;
warm sunshine, that stole so quietly in, to lend its ge-&#xD;
nial influence, like a generous nature, happy in the lux-&#xD;
ury of doing good, and half from the very devoted care&#xD;
bestowed upon them by the busy hands that watered&#xD;
each, as its peculiar gems best did thrive, giving to&#xD;
one a dry warm mould, to another gushing showers of&#xD;
potent rain, and brushed the dust, lest settling might&#xD;
impede their growth, and trained the delicate tendrils to&#xD;
give grace and beauty to their every proportion. This&#xD;
little department, almost a greenhouse, is a privileged&#xD;
place7 this winter's day, when all is robed in winter's&#xD;
emblem.&#xD;
A well-cushioned sofa, a lounge, and a capacious&#xD;
library of well selected books, a writing desk and writ-&#xD;
ing material, a mirror of exquisite workmanship, and &amp;amp;&#xD;
demure little armed chair, of the olden time, formed&#xD;
the principal furnishing of the neat apartment.&#xD;
The mistress stands in the middle of the room, in-&#xD;
tently contemplating the beautiful proportions cit a fine&#xD;

the apartment with most delicious odor.&#xD;

Nora's room, but we might have surmised as nnieh&#xD;
before; we knew at least it was the home of intellect&#xD;

"A happy morning to you, Miss Susie Grey; didn't&#xD;
expect you were astir at so early an hour in the&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
&#xD;
1~ eJUSt like you, Cousin Nora; never give any person&#xD;
credit for as much industry as you possess ~yourself."&#xD;
"No insinuation intended, only ii thought you were&#xD;
not an advocate for early rising, thought you didn't like&#xD;
it, didn't think it conducive to good health, &amp;amp;c."&#xD;
"No apology, no apology, Miss; you are 'forgiven&#xD;
already. I happened to feel a little out of humor with&#xD;
xnyself and a little more so with all the world beside&#xD;
this morning, so thought I could come and gas off to&#xD;
you a little, ask your advice, and then take just so&#xD;
much of it as suits my fancy. I never feel like telling&#xD;
ma all my little grievances; she always. says, Oh, Susie&#xD;
dear, ~you are so childish, it isn't worth bothering me&#xD;
about. NoW Ii don't like it. I don't think ma's ought&#xD;
to do that way, it's no way to encourage confidence in&#xD;
their daughters. They can't expect tQ put old heads&#xD;
on young shoulders. Don't b~giu to think I should&#xD;
like to see a girl of seventeen just like a lady of forty;&#xD;
such a character would be perfectly inconsistent, in my&#xD;
opinion. Ma never seems ~to sympathize with my little&#xD;
troubles; she calls them all whims, or childish fancies,&#xD;
when they really are troubles to me, or, at least, very&#xD;
considerable perplexities or vexstions, if no more."&#xD;
"Oh, Susie, if your spirits a~e at all. ruffled this&#xD;
morning, come and see this delightful moss rose, 'twill&#xD;
put y6u in better spirits with yourself and all the world&#xD;
beside. Jsn~t it beautiful? It seems to exhale Ian&#xD;
odor of cheerfulness, and these -h~liotropes grow as&#xD;

&#xD;
Just look, Susie, at this little pet of a thing, this&#xD;
winter tulip, how I have had to nurse it this winter;&#xD;
'twas so drooping the first part of winter, thought I&#xD;
should have lost it before this time, but I just turned&#xD;
this glass sand over it, and gave it all the sun and&#xD;
moisture its nature seemed to require, and you can't&#xD;
imagine how nicely it has come out."&#xD;
Susie had been standing with an abstracted air seem-&#xD;
ing to listen to her really interested auditor, but hear-&#xD;
ing very little, in reality, of anything she was saying.&#xD;
Turning abruptly and throwing herself on the lounge,&#xD;
she said, "Nora Wilmot, ii didn't come to hear a lecture&#xD;
on botany this morning; think your flowers are well&#xD;
enough, very nice indeed, but don't feel at all interested&#xD;
in them this morning. My feelings are ruffled, I do assure&#xD;
you, very considerably too, and I'm so pestered and wor-&#xD;
ried out of measure. I'll tell you just what bothers me&#xD;
this morning. You know Mary Price, she used to be Mary&#xD;
Sutton, you know, such a pretty, lively little creature, all&#xD;
life and animation, and as thoughtless as if she never so&#xD;
much as dreamed of trouble. When she married Char-&#xD;
ley Price he was said to be in a fine business in a dry&#xD;
goods store. Everybody thought she was doing so&#xD;
very well, and now she has two such nice little children.&#xD;
Poor Mary I&#xD;
"Well, what of her, Susie ? What has bappened'to&#xD;
Mary that is ~o very ~1istressiug?"&#xD;
"Oh! don't you think Charley has gone to drinking,&#xD;
and has added gambling too, it is said, and was entirely&#xD;
Bold outlast week. Oh! I am so sorry for poor Mary,&#xD;
it's so distressing. And I wanted ma to go and see&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary, and she only said, 'Poh, Susie, how can I help it&#xD;
if Charley Price has been sold out?' And they say&#xD;
one of Mary's children is sick, and they have had to&#xD;
leave their nice comfortable little cottage, that was so&#xD;
neat and tasty, and go to a fourth class house in the&#xD;
sul)erbs, with their sick child' too. Now isn't it distress-&#xD;
ing, Nora?"&#xD;
"It certainly is a most unfortunate circumstance; but&#xD;
don't you recollect Charley was said to not be a very&#xD;
steady young gentleman before marriage? 'Twas said he&#xD;
occasionally was known to indulge a little more than&#xD;
was consistent with entire sobriety and temperance, and,&#xD;
besides, he . was an unqualified oppose of all temper-&#xD;
ance movements. I think I have heard it said he never&#xD;
could be prevailed on to give his name to a pledge of&#xD;
any kind, or to take any stand on the subject."&#xD;
"Well, Nora, I do believe you are just as 'dumb as&#xD;
ma is. That is just what hoVhers me this~morning, be-&#xD;
cause, you know, I have' found out that Alfred Rayburn.&#xD;
is really opposed to temperance. I tried my hand on a&#xD;
bit of a lecture tried to say something to him like&#xD;
you talk, Nora, and he~ talked so very consequential,&#xD;
and said the advocate of temperance didn't begin in&#xD;
the right place; he thought they that were whole didn't&#xD;
need a physician. lie thought it would' be well to form&#xD;
a special' committee of Miss 'Wilmot, Miss Sallie Gano,&#xD;
and Miss Patty Lumis, and sen4 for Mrs. Lucy Stone&#xD;
and' have a woman's-rights, convention. Ju~t let h~u&#xD;
know the time, and he would be sure to be ou hand, if&#xD;
they would appoh~t him President of the eating a~d&#xD;

offended, but AiIf only laughed at me for U~~aiIIS.&#xD;
When I told him I meant to go~ and see Mary Price,&#xD;
don't you think he said I had better call on Dutch Joe&#xD;
while I am out~ as I will be in his ward. W~n't ittdo&#xD;
provoking? As if Mary, poor little thing, is to be&#xD;
cast off, just because her husband has done had. Oh,&#xD;
I'm so troubled, troubled, troubled, and nothing tan-&#xD;
gible or visible to trouble me either. I don't know why&#xD;
it is, I know I didn't use to be' so bothered, and I&#xD;
don't intend to be any more. I'll not meet trouble half&#xD;
way any more, I'll be happy while I can, and let every&#xD;
day provide for 'itself. I want ~rou to go with me,&#xD;
right off, to see Mary Price. Will you go, Nora?"&#xD;
"Certainly, I am at your service, my dear.; always&#xD;
at your service in that cause. Don't you know it is&#xD;
woman 's mission on eartlvto hunt up and administer to&#xD;
the comforts and necessities of the unfortunate ?"&#xD;
"And a holy mission it is, and a heavenly reward&#xD;
awaits the faithful fulfillment of it," said.. Susie, in a&#xD;
thoughtful tone, not at all usual to her gay, thoughtless&#xD;
nature; but the angels were stirring deep down the&#xD;
fount of her feelings,., and they were sending forth pre-&#xD;
cious drops of terkierest sympathy from that fountain&#xD;
that, Cousin Nora has said, will always keep Susie's&#xD;
heart in the right place. But Susie's- errors were not&#xD;
of the heary they were only fa~1ts of the hea4, and of&#xD;
a defective education. ,&#xD;
K&#xD;
~~he tw~ friends were~ soon on their way, treading&#xD;
street ~iK~str..eet, over the new fallen snow, until. they&#xD;
reached th~so~itskirts of the town, and were' shown an&#xD;

was designated as the , new residence of the once gay,&#xD;
laughing Mary Sutton.&#xD;
"Oh, Nora!" and Susie Grey pressed the arm of her&#xD;
Cousin more tightly as they stood waiting for an answer&#xD;
to their signal for admission, "isn't it too bad for poor&#xD;
Mary to have to come down so, she was so tenderly&#xD;
raised, and I've heard it said her aunt was a most esti-&#xD;
mable woman."&#xD;
The door was opened by Mary 'herself; she' blushed&#xD;
and was evidently embarrassed as she recognized the&#xD;
young ladies.&#xD;
"Good morning, Nora, good morning Susie," press.&#xD;
ing a hand of each. "Oh, come in, I am so 'glad -to&#xD;
see you," and she forced a smile of cheerfulness.&#xD;
"Little Lucy has been so ~ery~sick since we came here,&#xD;
she took a violent cold moving, which brought on oroup,&#xD;
and we were much alarmed' with her critical situation&#xD;
for several days and nights; we thought sometirRes 'du-&#xD;
ring the paroxysms of coughing 'she must smother 'for&#xD;
want of breath. '~&#xD;
"Is she better now ?"'asked Susie, with a deep inter-&#xD;
est in 'her 'tone.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, much better; the Doctor thinks the worst&#xD;
symptoms are all relieved, that with careful' nursing she&#xD;
will soon be ~ut again."&#xD;
Charley had been pacing backwards and forwards&#xD;
across the room,' looking~ very se~ons,' almost sad; at&#xD;
mention of coming here, and-Lucy taking ~cold moving,&#xD;
he walked quietly out . of the room, aud Nora thinks&#xD;
she saw a tear stealIng down his cheek..&#xD;
"I 'fe~r,"'said 'Mary, "Oharley will' i~~4irely laid&#xD;

by watching so constantly with Lucy~ I insisted&#xD;
on taking turns with him, but he wouldn't suffer me to,&#xD;
because, he said, he could stand it much better than I&#xD;
- could, and he didn't want us all to be sick at once. But&#xD;
I think it is so bard to sit all night alone.&#xD;
"But here is little Willie, ladies, bright as a May&#xD;
morning, trifles never hurt him. He is mamma's minia-&#xD;
ture man," she said, leading by the hand a bright, blue-&#xD;
eyed boy, whose cheeks had been kissed by but two&#xD;
summers. The b~'ight, rosy face was almost the exact&#xD;
image of what hi~ pa's had once been.&#xD;
"Oh, you sweet little spirit you-you little fairy&#xD;
king, you're a perfect miniature gentleman," said Susie&#xD;
Grey, imprinting a kiss on the fair dimpled cheek and&#xD;
beautifully rounded shoulders and neck.&#xD;
"Lucy is~ rather the most sprightly when she is in&#xD;
health," and Mary looked with a mother's pride on&#xD;
these her household treasures. "These are my jewels,"&#xD;
she said, turning to Nora.&#xD;
"And are well worthy a mother's pride, Mary."&#xD;
Kora's watchful eye was scanning (without seeming&#xD;
to notice anyth~g around her)~ the surroundings of&#xD;
Mary's home, the picture was anything but satis-&#xD;
factory. The~ seemed an air of real discomfort, so&#xD;
entirely destitute of even the comforts and conveniences&#xD;
of life.&#xD;
Mary said, apologetically, "We will not stay here&#xD;
long; you see we have no conveniences, only Charley&#xD;
couldn't get another place, the hoQses were all occupied,&#xD;
and we thought this would do awhile."&#xD;
How a faithful wife will make excuses for even the&#xD;
&#xD;
SUSIE'S VISIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
4'r&#xD;
&#xD;
vices of her husband. With a woman'~ true devotion,&#xD;
she will suffer blame to rest upon herself to shield him,&#xD;
as the vine will cling to the bak, though the branches&#xD;
be ever so xvi~hered and dry.&#xD;
But Susie gould not help ruminating in her busy way,&#xD;
why Mary ha4 had to give up her nice home, where she&#xD;
had so many~ not only conveniences, but elegant luxu-&#xD;
ries likewise~ and she could not feel kindly towards&#xD;
Charley Prh~e. Somehow Susie's spirits were unusu-&#xD;
ally low this morning for one of her temperament.&#xD;
Why was it.? Did coming events cast their shadows&#xD;
before?&#xD;
Nora and Susie rose to depart. Mary said, taking a.&#xD;
hand of each, "Do come again to see me; your very&#xD;
kind visit has improved my spirits. I have been so&#xD;
very gloomy~..Lucy's sickness and all. I did want so&#xD;
much to see you, Miss Wilmot," she said, hesitatingly.&#xD;
But Nora would not press an inquiry or seek more -con-&#xD;
fidence than was proffered, lest she should wound feel-&#xD;
ings, and merely said, with a friendly energy, "If I can be&#xD;
of any service to you, at any time, let me know, I will&#xD;
be at your service, Mary."&#xD;
Soon as they were fairly in the street, Susie said,&#xD;
"And that is a drunkar4's honie."&#xD;
"No, no,: my dear, the world doesn't call Charley,&#xD;
Price a drunkard' he only takes what the gentlemen&#xD;
would say a social glass, attends a convivial party and&#xD;
gives way to a little mental hallucination or a grand&#xD;
jollifleation, or gets a little how come you so, a bit of a&#xD;
~pree, occasionally, to keep his spirits up. I never&#xD;

world would call drunk; he is only what the world&#xD;
calls a genteel drinker; takes his glass, it may be, two&#xD;
or three times a day, and a social glass, occasionally, for&#xD;
the sake of friendship - might, perhaps, come under&#xD;
the list of a moderate drinker. Drink was only the re-&#xD;
mote cause of his present difficulties. In one of his&#xD;
social club associations, when wine was in and wit was&#xD;
out, no doubt, he gambled very largely, and lost all in&#xD;
one night, and, I think, they say has left him heavily in&#xD;
debt.'~&#xD;
"Oh I what an unprincipled creature to beggar his&#xD;
family so. Why, surely, Nor~, such debts are h6t bind-&#xD;
ingr by law, are they? I could not think a contract&#xD;
made under such circumstances could. be* considered a&#xD;
legal contract. Think I have hear4 pa say something&#xD;
to the effect that one person cannot collect a ~um off of&#xD;
another without value received for. it, and gambling is&#xD;
no value to any one."&#xD;
"That is all true, Susie; the law is correct in the mat-&#xD;
ter of gambling debts. Such debts are not collectable&#xD;
by law, and have no protection fro~u it; but you know&#xD;
there is a species of honor among gentlemen, so called,&#xD;
that forbids their taking advantage of the protection of&#xD;
the law to avoid paying a debt after contracting it.&#xD;
Su&amp;amp;h a~course would not be considered honorable among&#xD;
such gentlemen, of which class Charley Price is, no&#xD;
doubt, a very hopeful member, judging from his course&#xD;
of conduct."&#xD;
"Well, for ~my part, I can't say I very much admire&#xD;
such codes of honor. A gentleman, oh yes, a gentle-&#xD;
man, first dethrones reason, and then an unprincipled&#xD;

creature, another gentleman, you know, takes advantage&#xD;
of his imbecility, and gets him bound in a contract in-&#xD;
volving everything he possesses, even the domestic com-&#xD;
forts of his family, beggars his wife, and endangers the&#xD;
life of his child, all for the alone sake of honor. I be-&#xD;
lieve I have heard something said about honor among&#xD;
thieves, but I'll tell you one thing, if I were Mary Price,&#xD;
but I'm glad I'm not, I never would stand it. I'd see&#xD;
who had the law on, their side. I'd make one grand&#xD;
effort to recover back that property, if my husband&#xD;
wouldn't. I'd try the case and see where the honor&#xD;
was. I intend to ask Alfred if he won't undertake~&#xD;
Mai~y's case. How I would like to see that gambler&#xD;
(robber he ought ~to be called) disappointed in his ill&#xD;
gotten gains."&#xD;
"I don't know but some other young lady is turning&#xD;
woman's-rights-woman, and I shan't have to stand alone&#xD;
any longer."&#xD;
"Well, who can help it, I'd like to know, when they&#xD;
see so much palpable injustice to their own sex? I feel&#xD;
very much like turning knight errant on the occasion, a&#xD;
real out and out Sancho Pauza in the cause of injured&#xD;
innocence, and take up Mary Price's case as the:ftr~it.&#xD;
exhibition of my chivalry."&#xD;
"Susie, I have some hope that Ch.arley Price'is even&#xD;
now a reformed man. He has ~ subdued look, as. if he&#xD;
felt his degradation; felt that he had not done right, as&#xD;
if conscience was not at rest, and think I was not mis-&#xD;

"Everything has been so dull all day, and 1 felt so&#xD;

Oh, just listen to the gusts ~of wind and rain that beat&#xD;
against the casement;. it reminds me of something I read&#xD;
once about the steam king. I fancy his kingship is&#xD;

&#xD;
children after the strictest order of that faith. I've&#xD;
heard my mother say she had never knew a household&#xD;
where kindness and otdei~ so uniformly prevailed. It&#xD;
seemed the one principal object of the parents, for&#xD;
which they seemed most to labor, to advance the best&#xD;
interest of the~r children, not only for time but fQr:eter-&#xD;
nity also. And the children, too, seemed almost, equally&#xD;
assiduous in a study to make their parents happy.&#xD;
They were indeed a happy household. llappy,~ too,* on?&#xD;
the rnly. correct basis of earthly happiness, each in an&#xD;
effort to make the others happy9 There~vas one trait&#xD;
of family government practiced in my grandfather's&#xD;
family, that. I think worthy of imitation in many othev&#xD;
households. Soon. as the little feet were old enough to&#xD;
stray beyond the paternal roof, ,my graudma's habit was,&#xD;
regularly every evening, soon as the evening lamps were&#xD;
lighted, to ring a small bell, kept for the purpose, which&#xD;
was a signal for every little pair of delinquent feet to&#xD;
be seen hurrying homeward. Soon all were safely&#xD;
sheltered within the dear embrace of home influence.&#xD;
And this truly judicious practice was never omitted&#xD;
until each member of the family circle had fairly taken&#xD;
~tations as members of that. society that nature, far less&#xD;
tjiarx, education, ~had fitted, them to adorn; for our&#xD;
grand-patents were entirely of the opinion th4. 'just&#xD;

'train u.p a ~huId in the. way it should~gQ, when it is old ~&#xD;

tion. Our grandf~tJ~er niust have b~en possessed of&#xD;
much more liberality than most gentlemen of the o~d&#xD;

his sons."&#xD;
"Yes, and I like him all the better for it," said&#xD;
Susie.&#xD;
~' At the ~age of, eighteen my .moth~er married Dr.&#xD;
Wilmot, of her native town, with the consent of all her&#xD;
friends, who was my.father, you know. He had eom~&#xD;
nienced the practice of medk~ine some two years before,&#xD;
and was already doing a thriving business, fast gaii~ing&#xD;
an influence and competence. What bright, dreams 'of&#xD;
the future fancy wove on her imagination.; what fairy&#xD;
castles, all of air, with "o foundation save her fertile&#xD;
fancy; how the world was to. be all of sunshine and&#xD;
moonbeams, woven into happiness, for her acceptance,&#xD;
we will leave to those of more experience in those mat-&#xD;
ters, and endeavor to trace their fulfillment.&#xD;
Grandfather Wilmot was not one of the .strk~t sort of&#xD;
either citizens or parents. A latitudinariati in religion,&#xD;

Young as we were, we knew she meant no unkindness,&#xD;
and we all loved her dearly. How we would all nestle&#xD;
close down to grandma's chair; and the most envied&#xD;
head was the one that was nestled closest in her lap.&#xD;
She would say, in the dearest kind voice, 'Oh, you dear&#xD;
little thing, you are so bad, grandma doesn't know what&#xD;
to do with you; you little sweet lamb, you are so mis-&#xD;
ehievons, grandma will have to whip you. Why don't&#xD;

upset grandma's workbasket, and spilled all her work,&#xD;
you mischief; and, now, you outlaw, you've got my&#xD;

dear kind soul would go on all day long, while we were&#xD;

NORhA~ - WILMOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
is so interwoven with that of my father~ that 'it seems&#xD;
necessary to read the stori~ together. I My father very&#xD;
soon acquired a high reputation as a practitioner, and,&#xD;
of course1 a fair competence of this world's goods.&#xD;
He possessed an agreeable, prepossessing, and hand-&#xD;
some exterior, with affluent, easy, and elegant address,&#xD;
united to the most obliging manner and a sensitively&#xD;
kind heart. And there you have a stereotyped likeness&#xD;
of my dear father ere the dem~n of intemperance de-&#xD;
stroyed all his talents and manhood.~ He had, happily,&#xD;
chosen a profession that did not, of necessity, often call&#xD;
him into scenes of dissipation, then so common even in&#xD;
the highest walks of life. iEI2is profession tended rather&#xD;
to cultivate the sympathies and charities of our natures&#xD;
than to arouse the grosser passions and appetites.&#xD;
My father was very popular at this time, and some of&#xD;
his fri Is-thought ih~ would make a fine figure as Sen-&#xD;
.atoj~ ~l~:~~4ght,.at the~ me time, advance his own&#xD;
~liiterest and serve his coftntry a very advantageous pur-&#xD;
pose; might be weaving laurels for his own brow and&#xD;
be adding weight to the nation's councils.&#xD;
He urged as an entirely reasonable objection the in~&#xD;
terference with his business. My mother strenuously&#xD;
opposed such a measure,, only because she was happy in&#xD;
her domestic relations, and saw in such ngement&#xD;
an arra&#xD;
the separation for a time of her hQusehold idols. But&#xD;
it proved far more than all this to these loving hearts.&#xD;
Well might the angels weep briny tears over the pros~&#xD;
pect of their future. My father's highest enjoyment had&#xD;
hitherto been found in the bosom of his family, for he&#xD;
i~tnd my: mother, were ardently attached to each other-.&#xD;
&#xD;
NQR4'8 STOItY.&#xD;
whatever wasithe happiness of the one was of the .other.&#xD;
But, like -many other wives, she was vain-, of. her. hus-&#xD;
band's talents, and readily yielded to any circumstance&#xD;
that was a gratification to his pride and ambition.&#xD;
:And now nay father's name was soon fairly before the&#xD;
people as a candidate for Senatorship. He was then&#xD;
the people's man, and must obey the wishes of his party&#xD;
in some measure, which ~called him into scenes of dissi-&#xD;
pation to which he had hitherto been a stranger. His&#xD;
evenings, instead of being spent in the 'bosom of his&#xD;
family, must be spent abroad, t~ud he must be on friendly&#xD;
terms with all classes; for a son of J~rin, whether he be&#xD;
scrupulQllsly sober or not, has still an influence at the bal..&#xD;
lot box. And, although my father had hitherto been&#xD;
considered strictly temperate, he had no particular- scru-&#xD;
ples on the subject of temperance, and, as was- then&#xD;
customary, he often, - during the political campaign,&#xD;
made use of the social glass as a means of increasing&#xD;
his popularity, with one class of voters.. Dram drink~.&#xD;
ing was not then so entirely unpopular with the better&#xD;
portions of society; ardent spirits were used to some&#xD;
extent in all classes. Temperance, as anything like a&#xD;
moral principle, was but just beginning to agitate the&#xD;
public mind in these central States.&#xD;
My -father was a successful candidate, ,and, of course,&#xD;
the winter must be spent- at the capital of the State,&#xD;
where he was thrown into the society of very many&#xD;
gentlemen of superior mind and talent, -hut, sometimes,&#xD;
of not very strictly moral principles. He, unfbrtun-&#xD;
ately, possessed an ardent, enthusiastic temperament, that&#xD;
yielded but too readily to the influence of superior&#xD;

minds. his generous social nat~ire and urbanity of&#xD;
manner gave him an influence in whatever society he&#xD;
was thrown into, either for good ~or evil. There was&#xD;
no half-way enjoyment with him; whatever he under~&#xD;
took he did with a will; the whole energies of his&#xD;
mind were thrown into whatever object presented itself&#xD;
for consideration. Had he embraced the temperance&#xD;
cause, which then just begun to excite general attention,&#xD;
he would have made a host within himseW a full team,&#xD;
if he had girded on his harness in the right cause, for all&#xD;
his energies and' his talents would have been given to&#xD;
the cause if he had only espoused it. But, unfortun~&#xD;
ately for himself, for his family, amid for society, he was&#xD;
surrounded hy a different atmosphere and by different&#xD;
influeiices. And his early education and training pre~&#xD;
rented' no barrier against the great preponderance of&#xD;
evil. Influenced, perhaps, to a considerable extent by&#xD;
concurrent circumstances, he took the same side of&#xD;
many well mneaiming' men in those days, who were hou~.&#xD;
estly mistaken in their views, that, 'in giving a signature&#xD;
to a pledge of abstinence, they would be bartering their&#xD;
liberties-yielding a portion of their precious boon of&#xD;
freedom. They were not willing to give up the privb&#xD;
lege of destroying themselves soul and body, and giving&#xD;
to their children, neighbors, and friends the same cov-&#xD;
eted blessing. So, for fear of not being free, they ob-&#xD;
jected to the principle, and arrayed themselves on the&#xD;
side of anti-temperance, strengthening the hands of the&#xD;
enemies of 'morality and good order. Many strictly&#xD;
temperate men in that way stood as way-marks to 'in-&#xD;
temperance without being conscious of the effect of their&#xD;
influence.&#xD;

)     many times we were told of the joyful time in prospect~&#xD;

was to~ be in reserve to say and do when papa came,&#xD;

&#xD;
the nobler part of his manly nature, his friends had&#xD;
much to hope, and again my mother was herself, again&#xD;
prosperity crowned his efforts, and his friends, even the&#xD;
summer ones, flocked around him. IDr. Wilmot was&#xD;
again the affable gentleman and agreeable friend, an&#xD;
ornament to his profession, the centre of social society,&#xD;
and the idol of his family. Oh, how she, the stricken&#xD;
one, clung to this hope, so blissful, so endearing, that&#xD;
his reformation would be lasting. But she, herself, had&#xD;
never gone to the strong for strength; had never cast&#xD;
her burthen upon him. who is willing to succor them&#xD;
who are tempted and tried; but, in her own strength,&#xD;
had bowed her heart to the storm when it beat so furi-&#xD;
ously-it was small wonder her bark was so near&#xD;
foundering. Temperance cQuld hardly be said to be~&#xD;
fashionable in fashionable society at that time, neither&#xD;
was drunkenness openly encouraged."&#xD;
"Oh, IL thought temperance was always fashionable,"&#xD;
said Susie.&#xD;
"Very far from it, my deir; the time has been in our&#xD;
own country, and is even now common and customary&#xD;
in all European countries, to grace the dinner tables of&#xD;
the rich with an ample supply of choice wines; and the&#xD;
common people of England, in their inability to supply&#xD;
that luxury, substitute beer or ale. So great is the&#xD;
consumption'of ale in the kingdom, that the tax on its&#xD;
manufactory yields a very handsome profit annually to&#xD;
the government. It has been computed that mil-&#xD;
lioris~ of gallons are annually consumed within the&#xD;
kingdom, and recently it is affirmed the manufacturers&#xD;
are drugging the Englishman's ale after the same order&#xD;
&#xD;
of our own alcoholic drinks, making it a more sure and&#xD;
certain poison than it was formerly, adding a most&#xD;
deadly poison to the original strength of the beverage."&#xD;
"But, Cousin Nora, I shouldn't think ale would be&#xD;
as injurious, really, as the common drink of our own&#xD;
country."&#xD;
"The quality I presume is not, on account of the&#xD;
amount of alcoholic spirit it' contains; but the English-&#xD;
man is not one whit behind us, for he makes up in&#xD;
quantity all that is wanting in quality, and is, in reality,&#xD;
the loser; because even those longest accustomed to&#xD;
the use of alcoholic drinks, can get beastly drunk in a&#xD;
very short time, but 'it will take an English ale-drinker&#xD;
full half a day to drink himself well drunk."&#xD;
"But, Cousin Nora, if the fun consists in the drink-&#xD;
ing, the Englishman is the gainer all the time, because&#xD;
his lasts the longest, you know."&#xD;
"Fun, Susie! I don't see that there could be much&#xD;
fun extracted any way from such ruinous practices."&#xD;
"If they are so very bad, so ruinous and pernicious,&#xD;
and all that, why don't the sober, sensible part of com-&#xD;
munity act like rational intelligence ought to act,&#xD;
and banish it all from the land forthwith? I can't&#xD;
see any kind of utility there can possibly be in continu-&#xD;
ing to manufacture an article, the use of which is called&#xD;
soul-destroying and the whole vocabulary of its&#xD;
abuses and nobody pretends to say it does any person&#xD;
any good. Why countenance a thing that is only an&#xD;
evil in society - keep constantly making an article, and&#xD;
then worry the lives out of the best portion of society&#xD;
to keep people from using it?"&#xD;

"Just because, Susie, it is so much easier said than&#xD;

"Well, my way would be just to blow up the whole&#xD;
concern at once, make no half way business of it. Just&#xD;
pass a law at once to have the manufacture of it stop-&#xD;
ped forthwith, and have no more made. I believe I'm&#xD;
a better philosopher than some people, after all."&#xD;
"But I think you. look at things as they should be,&#xD;
and not as they are."&#xD;
"What is to hinder temperance men from having&#xD;
things as they should be, I want to know, in a free&#xD;
country? Why suffer from the effects of bad laws,&#xD;
when the law-making is entirely in their own hands ?"&#xD;
"But 'don't you. know, Susie, just so long as men cai~&#xD;
make gain out of a traffic, they can always find an apol-&#xD;
ogy for its continuance?. There is said to be great&#xD;
magic in an almighty dollar. In opposing the manu~&#xD;
featuring and vending of all intoxicating beverages, we&#xD;
come, of necessity, in direct contact with two very&#xD;
strong and, with some persons, almost governing prin-&#xD;
ciples of our natures, appe1~ite and love of gain, either&#xD;
of which are strong incentives to action. You know&#xD;
men Will forget self-respect, standing, respectability,&#xD;
family, friends, all for the sake of a depraved appetite,&#xD;
and will sell and barter soul and body almost for the&#xD;
sake of gain; will compass sea and land merely to gain&#xD;
this world's goods."&#xD;
"And isn't it poor pay when they get it, Nora?"&#xD;
"Rather a small recompense I acknowledge, hut such&#xD;
as it is, very many are found willing to barter their best&#xD;
interests for it, and to take a trust for pay in the end.&#xD;

It seems a glaring defect of American character, that&#xD;
a stranger, especially if he chance to be a foreigner, is&#xD;
far more readily trusted than a tried friend or an old,&#xD;
familiar ~~eitizen. Somehow, as a people, we admire&#xD;
everything new, and strange, and foreign.&#xD;

largely; but before the time of maturity came, Green&#xD;
was gone, no one knew where; but it was soon&#xD;
ascertained that he had left very large claims against&#xD;

destruction - anxious to drown every reflection of the&#xD;
past, every ray of conscience, of responsibility, and&#xD;
thought of retribution, in a total, an entire forgetfulness,&#xD;
apparently oblivious of all external circumstances. For&#xD;

thirst, that was consuming him, seeming only to crave&#xD;
that unnatural stimulant, that was eating up both soul&#xD;
and body -.-' he was almost all the while like one in a&#xD;

was a change. And him, it was awful to contemplate.&#xD;
lie was the bloated semblance of himself. His Powers&#xD;
of inward resistance were all entirely gone or altogether&#xD;
paralyzed..~th~ black waters of despair had well nigh&#xD;
overwhelmed his whole being. But why dwell longer&#xD;
on a. picture that but harrows up every feeling of n~y&#xD;
nature? But I could not give my mother's story without&#xD;
giving my father's also, for, you know, the scripture ac-&#xD;
count is, 'they twain are one flesh,' and it would be&#xD;
hard to separate them, but to me it is~a painful recital."&#xD;

"No, -no, Susie, I wanted you to know it all. One&#xD;
morning my poor pa got up a little more rational than&#xD;
usual, more like himself than he had , been for a long&#xD;
time; washed and shaved and arranged himself with&#xD;
more than ordinary care, put on his hat,, (how well I do&#xD;
remember that morning,) walked out into the street, and&#xD;
my mother never- saw him ~afterwards. In answer to all&#xD;
inquiry, all the mQst diligent search, to every advertise-&#xD;
ment, the same answer always came back of no tidings,&#xD;
no intelligence, no knowledge, no news ~ it was always&#xD;
the same discouraging negative. All we Ihave ever&#xD;
known is, that he is not." -&#xD;
Susie had sat during the latter part of Nora's thrill-&#xD;
ing narrative looking the very pictured embodiment of&#xD;
excitement, her eyes slowly dilating,~ her lips slightly&#xD;
separated, and her whole frame trembling with the in~&#xD;
tensity of her feelings.&#xD;
"Oh, Nora, how could your poor ma bear-so much?"&#xD;
"Only, Susi&amp;amp;, because life sometimes has to be borne,&#xD;
and she felt that she still- had duties performed; her&#xD;
childr~ii looked to her as their sole guardian, their only&#xD;
protector and friend; and, with a mother's true instincts&#xD;
and energy, she nerved herself for the task. Many&#xD;
would have sunk under such an accumulated weight of&#xD;
~e, but ma was strongest when she most, needed&#xD;
strength, most energetic when her .- outward circum-&#xD;
stances demanded energy she never shrank from~ re-&#xD;
Tepotisibility. I~ut the mystery is easily solved: she bad&#xD;
boexv 4ed by adversity to Him 'who has never said to the&#xD;
house of Israel, seek ye my face in vain;' to Him who&#xD;
has promised to be a 'father to the fatherless and the&#xD;
&#xD;
NOUA'8 S~PORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
widow's God.' Although, when surroundedd by prose&#xD;
parity and the allnrements of the world, when her&#xD;
household idols were unbroken, she had felt no need of&#xD;
a Savior, no need of a friend in heave-u, when the clouds&#xD;
of adversity lowered, and the th4nders and teinpests of&#xD;
wrath burst upon her unsheltered head, she had meekly&#xD;
bowed her head;. and, as a weaned child, had cleaned&#xD;
npon Him who is able to succor them that are tempted&#xD;
and tried. But the shock upon her naturally feeble,&#xD;
nervous system, was mOre than her nature could sustain&#xD;
and my mother sank very rapidly. *She did not seem&#xD;
to - suffer much bodily pain, but sank so , gently;&#xD;
it was like - the gradual ,~id-ing out of the light at&#xD;
close of day.-.. like to a calm after a mighty storm.&#xD;
We were not conscious of an hourly change, but -we knew&#xD;
each day she was growing weaker and more ethereal.&#xD;
At first we had been so incredulous, and had clung so&#xD;
hopefully to every encouraging symptom, all the while&#xD;
hoping against hope; we felt 'twas hard to give her up;&#xD;
we saw she was passing away, But to her. Death's&#xD;
messenger was not unexpected, not unwelcome.&#xD;
'Death was but the gate to endless joys,&#xD;
- -    Why should she dread to enter there?'&#xD;
But the eve she died-'tis fixed within my memory with&#xD;
a strong, abiding intensity, that time nOr circumstances -&#xD;
can ever obliterate after giving charge of her few&#xD;
temporalb concerns, she gave her dying charge to each&#xD;
friend in turn so calmly, as if she wa&#xD;
pleasant journey, with not one   s only going on a&#xD;
-                     fear for the-consequences&#xD;
or results; then, turning to me, her first born, she&#xD;
said, laying her thin, wasted hand on my head, "Nora,&#xD;

my daughter, remember thy Creator in the days. of&#xD;
thy youth; seek first the kingdom of heaven, and all&#xD;
things shall be added.' What more could a dying&#xD;
mother say to an orphaned daughter? Then she&#xD;
seemed to lay unconscious for some time; all present&#xD;
thought the angel presence had come to claim her trusting&#xD;
spirit; but,~ suddenly arousing her fast receding energies,&#xD;
~he said in a clear, steady voice, with her eyes all the&#xD;
while fixed full upon me, 'Nora, dear, if God spares&#xD;
you here to womanhood, use all your influence, all your&#xD;
energy and talent that He may bless you with, against&#xD;
the sin of intemperance; it is the sum of all iniquities;&#xD;
it is your mother's dying injunction, my child, remem..&#xD;
ber it all.' Then, in a l&amp;amp;wer tone, she said, 'If I only&#xD;
did know what became of him, but I can leave him in&#xD;
the same bands that II leave these, soon to be. orphaned&#xD;
ones, Him who is able to save.' There was a feeble&#xD;
fluttering, aDd all was over; and there was another&#xD;
voice aromA the throne above. All present felt that&#xD;
'The chamber where the saint of God had met her fate,&#xD;
Was privileged above the common walks of life;&#xD;
Quite on the verge of heaven.'&#xD;
Now, Cousin Susie, you know why I am just what I&#xD;
am.&#xD;

"Oh! Cousin Nora," and Susie Grey came running&#xD;
almost in breathless haste into Nora'.s room, "such good&#xD;
news to tell you. I've just been reading the Ladies'&#xD;
Garland, and came upon this advertisement:&#xD;
"'The friends of general reform will hold a convention&#xD;
in the town of W----..........r, commencing Thursday, April&#xD;
9th, to take into consideration the disabilities, and the&#xD;
best method of removing them, under which females&#xD;
labor in our so-called free country. We wish, particu-&#xD;
larly, all the friends of perfect equality of the sexes in&#xD;
social, legal and political relations, to lend us their infin.&#xD;
ence. And all others who admire open, free discussion,&#xD;
on all subjects of reform, have a cordial invitation.&#xD;
"'Several of the most popular advocates of Woman's&#xD;

time to answer in her enthusiasm. "I'll do just like&#xD;
the advertisement says, listen to the arguments, pro and&#xD;
con, on both sides, and try. to judge accordingly. But&#xD;
you didn't tell me if you would go, Nora ?"&#xD;
"I don't exactly know and don't like to say 8olong&#xD;
beforehand.. I might have quite a different opinion&#xD;
when 'I know more of the matter."&#xD;
"Well, I can't for the life of me see what you can&#xD;
object to so very much in that kind of a convention, got&#xD;
up too on so very liberal a principle.".&#xD;
"Did I say I objected, my dear ?"&#xD;
"Oh! I thought you meant that; but, will you go?&#xD;
That is all I want to know about; say you will go at&#xD;
once, and I will hook you ~. member. of my party. I&#xD;
want a nice cQngenial party of some eight or te~i choice&#xD;
spirits, so we can have a nice time, with plenty of fun.&#xD;
We can go over on the morning train and be in good&#xD;
time for the opening exercises. I'm thinking it will be&#xD;
so queer to hear the speaker's addressing MIr~. President;&#xD;
for I've understood th~y almost invariably have a lady&#xD;
president at these meetings. But I do want you to go&#xD;
so bad, Nora, for I think if our side should chance to&#xD;
be in need of an advocate, you would, make a charming&#xD;
one, for do you know I think you could make a real nice&#xD;
speech, if you would. only try ?"&#xD;
"Which do you call our side, Susie ?"&#xD;
"The negative side, to be sure. I'm not just in for&#xD;
making presidents, and senators, and governors; and&#xD;

the whole concern. But I intend to go to the conven-&#xD;

passengers. Susie's party consisted of some half dozen&#xD;
or more choice spirits, as she said, chosen entirely for&#xD;
their congeniality andhappy joyousness of temperament&#xD;
She said they were going all for 4ie sake of information,&#xD;
and a little bit for fun. There was Fred Morley, she&#xD;
selected him to -suit sober, old fashioned Nora; Mr.&#xD;
Wilber, because he has so inucli May~day sunshine in&#xD;
his composition and Sallie Martin had to. come out of&#xD;
special compliment to LMIr.. Wilber, you know; Dr. Ban-&#xD;
cou~'t, because there is such a magnetism in his voice and&#xD;
smile, and such a fascination in his manner.......~nd his&#xD;
laugh, Susie says it is just like a summer song~ or a gush&#xD;
of heart poetry....... he is well put i~ as an ornament to&#xD;
the company; and Lilly Mason had to cQnle, or Dr.&#xD;
]3ancourt would have been disappointed; and Aif 1I&amp;amp;y..&#xD;

Turning to Mr. Morley, she asked, with a quaint look&#xD;
of demure intelligence: "Mr. Morley, what are your&#xD;
opinions of the new-toned notions of Woman's Rights ?"&#xD;
"Oh! I aim to be on the right side on that very inter-&#xD;
esting question, Miss."&#xD;
"But, pray sir, which side do you term the right&#xD;
side ?"&#xD;
"Well, Miss, I am of opinion that the sphere of wo-&#xD;
man's usefulness? talents, energies and aspirations, the&#xD;
higher, nobler developments of genius and skill, might&#xD;
be materially enlarged without detracting in any degree&#xD;
from the refined and exalted position nature seems to&#xD;
have designed and fitted her to occupy in society. In&#xD;
my opinion, the usages of society, more than the opinions&#xD;
of liberal minds of either sex, have cramped and dwarf-&#xD;
ed female genius, like the little 'tiny Chinese shoes,&#xD;
making it a gr~ve departure from feminine grace to step&#xD;
beyond the' p!escrib~d limits which society places as&#xD;
land-marks of~ gentility and pr6priety. If a woman&#xD;
dares to assume the independence of' breaking the&#xD;
shackles of fashion and thinking' for herself especially if&#xD;
she should lay any claim to intelligence or individuality,&#xD;
she is called peculiar, eccentric, tdo masculine, merely&#xD;
because ~he has the 'moral courage to endeaVor to culti-&#xD;
vate the gifts her Creator has eDdowed her with. The&#xD;
present I regard as a crisis in woman's history, that the&#xD;
cause of womankind has much at stake in the present&#xD;
agitation. A few master spirits have stepped forth to&#xD;
assert her equality and independence, and have, like all&#xD;
reformers, asked more than w5uld be for her advantage,&#xD;
or the well-bei~ig Qf society, in a political point of view;&#xD;

(&#xD;

TH~C CONVENTION.&#xD;
they have suffered their enthusiasm to get the better of&#xD;
judgment and discretion - but after this fitful enthusi-&#xD;
asm has expended itself in unwanted fiashe~, and the&#xD;
public mind has rid itself of the dross and mist of ignor-&#xD;
ance and coXiventionality, it will be found that the sub-&#xD;
ject of female capabilities and developments has ~gained~&#xD;
largely by the agitation. Already the subject has made&#xD;
very considerable strides in improvement and liberality.&#xD;
But a few years since females were thought to need&#xD;
but a very limited education, and a female college would&#xD;
have been deemed a literary monstrosity, &amp;amp; useless ex-&#xD;
penditure of time and means.&#xD;
"But, in a legal point of viewi think woman's disa-&#xD;
bilities need a very considerable amount of redress. On&#xD;
those subjects I think she should enjoy equal privileges'&#xD;
with the other sex. Where she exerts her time, or tab&#xD;
ent, or energies, her exertions should be rewarded equal-&#xD;
ly according to service rendered, and not be cramped by&#xD;
the present liberalities of custom, that she might have&#xD;
more appropriate~ and larger fields for enterprise and&#xD;
energy.&#xD;
"But politically, ladies, with some slight improve~&#xD;
merits, I do notthink I would be in favor of imposing&#xD;
additional obligations either on her time or talents; do&#xD;
not believe it is consistent with the refined and exalted&#xD;
position she is designed to occupy ilisociety, that ladies&#xD;
shall be public politicians. Snch a position must of neces-&#xD;
sity bring her too directly in contact with the grosser&#xD;
elements of human nature in its rudest phases. Such a&#xD;
contact, too frequently imposed, will tend to blunt' the&#xD;
sensibilities and refinements of her nature, as well as to&#xD;

lessen that exalted respect that men feel for the female&#xD;
character. So you see., ladies, I am a little jealous of&#xD;
our political .advantages -don't feel like yielding up&#xD;
the privileges of office-holding and office~seeking so very&#xD;
readily, not even on the principle of gallantry to the fair&#xD;
sex, ladies."&#xD;
"Well, Mr. Gallantry, we ladies are going to award&#xD;
you a meed of praise for the extreme honesty of your&#xD;
declarations," said Susie, "if you are not willing to di-&#xD;
vide your advantages with us; and then we are going&#xD;
to' make an effort to supplant you gentlemen in the divis-&#xD;
ion of the offices of hon~, if not of profit; and then)&#xD;
when we. get all we claim, we know just who we are&#xD;
going to thank for all we get..' 'We are not caring a fig&#xD;
for all the advantages7 as you term them, but we just&#xD;
want an. equal ~ that is going, that's&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"Perhaps, ladies, you forget that our responsibilities&#xD;
are in accordance with our .privileges. 'Under the present&#xD;
regulations of :society, females, are shielded from very&#xD;
heavy duties and responsibilities that a more public posi-&#xD;
tion would impose, 'and still' Ithink herrelations are, in&#xD;
very n~any respects, crowded with responsibilities; and&#xD;
I think where these are met with firmness and patieuc~,&#xD;
they are adding just as much to the great mass 'of 'hu~'&#xD;
man happiness as the efforts of the most learned 'judge&#xD;
of the land could, and are deserving of the same come&#xD;
ruendation and favor." ' ' '&#xD;

something very deep and knowing, and wise and learn~&#xD;

with deep, gushing tenderness and sympathy, refined&#xD;
a0~ections, and gentle, active, energy, going forth with&#xD;

stereotyped formulas of polite society. Indeed, ladies,&#xD;
I never was an admirer of formality and etiquette, mere&#xD;

something or somebody else. I like a real character, all&#xD;

put up her finger significantly, as much as to say: "See,&#xD;

sessions, is oppressive and unjust in the extreme, and is&#xD;
a stigma on the good sense and generosity. of an intelli-&#xD;
gent community, and ought no longer to be tolerated or&#xD;
suffered by any people. Therefore,&#xD;
"RESOLVED1 That according to the sense of this meet-&#xD;
ing, the wife. should have (at the death of her husband)&#xD;
of right, in fee simple, the one-half of all ~unembar-&#xD;
rassed property or funds in his hands at the time of his&#xD;
death, his will, notwithstanding, to the contrary.&#xD;
"RESOLVED, That it is' not only woman's duty, but her&#xD;
privilege also, to stand side by side with man in every&#xD;
effort he may be called on to make for the amelioration&#xD;
of the condition of society, or in the great struggles for&#xD;
reform of the present day possessing with him equal&#xD;
privileges to battle for the glorious cause of human phi-&#xD;
lanthropy and tiuth."&#xD;
There were several more unimportant' resolutions&#xD;
which our reporter did not get, but the journals of the&#xD;
day have preserved them no doubt, but as they are un-&#xD;
important to our present purpose, we will not go in&#xD;
search ~of them, but leave the journalizing readers to&#xD;
gather as they may feel disposed.&#xD;
It was then moved and seconded that the resolutions&#xD;
should be adopted severally as they c~une in order, which&#xD;
would give an opportunity for discussion on each several&#xD;
resolution as it was brought up for adoption.&#xD;
The first resolution being rea~l, free discussion was&#xD;
invited, and'invitation given to all present to take part.&#xD;
Nora could:uot help admiring the grave dignity with&#xD;
which the President arose and presented the business of&#xD;
&#xD;
the committee to the Convention. She was tall, full&#xD;
chested, and rather largely proportioned, with a mild,&#xD;
benign expression of intelligence and dignity, set off by&#xD;
the peculiarly unique dress of the Society of Friends,&#xD;
that, Susie says, set upon her with such an easy grace&#xD;
that she was more than half persuaded to be a convert&#xD;
to her mode of dress herself. She thinks the plain, un-&#xD;
pretending cap, with the neatly fitting drab dress of&#xD;
richest stuft; and the rich shawl of costliest crape from&#xD;
China, but so scrupulously plain it had neither fringe&#xD;
nor order, folded over the shoulders with such an easy&#xD;
grace, without a chance wrinkle, it was charming all&#xD;
but the bonnet. Susie thinks she can never be brought&#xD;
to admire such a hideous looking bonnet, even if the&#xD;
IPresidentess of the Woman's IRights Convention does&#xD;
wear one because there is nothing tasty, or graceful,&#xD;
or eVen comely, or convenient in the appearance of&#xD;
them; she really does think such a thing would look&#xD;
horrible on a young face like hers, without the least&#xD;
chan~~e to set off the front with. flowers that she can see;&#xD;
and Susie is such a natural admirer of flowers, because&#xD;
they are 50 much like nature in her very best moods,&#xD;
when she dons her holiday costume and appears injier&#xD;
very best appearance and colors.&#xD;
1~ut there seemed some hesitancy on the part of&#xD;
speakers to commence, when a gentleman arose in the&#xD;
centre of the audience, who was recognized as a Mr.&#xD;
Sawyer, from the little village of B..-.----.-~---, an attorney,&#xD;
and an aspirant to office of several years standing, and&#xD;
a bachelor somewhere on the shady side of thirty. lie&#xD;

&#xD;
wite and 'blue, as the 'girls said, in rapid succession,&#xD;
looked first at 'the ladies' side and then at the floor,&#xD;
cleared his throat, took a drink of water, and then found&#xD;
courage to say:&#xD;
"Mrs. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am&#xD;
sorry, sincerely s~ to"' witness so much' hesitancy on&#xD;
the part of speakers to rally to the support~'of the great&#xD;
and important questions now before this Convention.' I&#xD;
have waited for other speakers because I was conscious&#xD;
there were those present who were capable of doing the&#xD;
subject justice, ample justice. Feeling my own inability,&#xD;
I hesitated, waited for others," he said, with a flourish and&#xD;
a low bow. "I would mi~h rather listen to some of&#xD;
you ladies than to stand here and speak myself, much&#xD;
rather, ladies. But I did feel it due to the subject, due&#xD;
to the audience, and especially due to the fair subjects&#xD;
expecting to be benefited by the very excellent' resolu-&#xD;
tions now before this meeting for consideration, that&#xD;
something be said. Even though the little rivulet might&#xD;
not yield the same support to the mighty ocean that the&#xD;
sweeping river does, yet it may add its 'tiny support with&#xD;
ju&amp;amp;j~ as cheerful,' willing a. mind.&#xD;
"Mrs. President, I am sentimentally' in favor of this&#xD;
resolution, consciously fn its favor, yes, heart and soul&#xD;
in its favor - and I am proud to stand in its support,&#xD;
because I believe by nature woman has the same polit[&#xD;
cal rights that man has..-. a~ right to vote, a right to 'hold&#xD;
office, and a right to make and administer laws'; these&#xD;
sh~ has as a matter of right. The strong hand and' the&#xD;
great head of man keep her down, nothing more, in our&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OONVZNTION.               8'r&#xD;
boasted land of freedom and equality, where all men~are&#xD;
said to be born free. In America woman has no politi-&#xD;
cal rights is not a citizen in full, for she has no voice&#xD;
in making or administering the laws, none in electing&#xD;
the rulers or administrators thereof; she can hold no&#xD;
office ~-cannot even be a committee of a primary school,&#xD;
or'~ overseer of the poor, though her heart be ever so&#xD;
tenderly alive to the claims of suffering humanity, and&#xD;
her great, charitable heart swelling away down in its&#xD;
very depths with a gush of genuine sympathies for the&#xD;
sufferings of the poor and afflicted. But it wouldn't do&#xD;
to make woman an overseer of the poor, that would be&#xD;
elevating woman to office - enough to shock the nerves&#xD;
of half the office-seekers in Christendom~; besides, it&#xD;
would certainly be very unfeminine t6 see her who was&#xD;
last at the Cross and fitst at the Sepulchre, hunting up&#xD;
the poor and needy sons and daughters of affliction and&#xD;
administering to their necessities according to law. But&#xD;
any man 'with conscience enough to keep out of jail,&#xD;
mind enough to escape the poorhouse, and body enough&#xD;
to drop his ballot in the box, he is a voter; he may&#xD;
have no character, even no money, that is no matter, he&#xD;
is male he is a lord of 'creation; he 'may be a sons&#xD;
of 'Erin, and a fresh import at 'that.-..perhaps a devotee&#xD;
of the Pope's Holiness;~ no matter, he too can have 'a&#xD;
~oice~in the government, can cast in his ballot; but the&#xD;
noblest woman has no voice in the state men make&#xD;
laws disposing of her Property, her:person,~her children,&#xD;
still ~he must bear it all with humble patience.&#xD;
"But, ladies, Viewing 'the subject as a matter of pure&#xD;
right;' and pure science, I know' no reason why woman&#xD;

88&#xD;
&#xD;
NORA WILMOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
should not be a voter, or an office-holder, or make and&#xD;
administer laws. I do not see how I can shut myself&#xD;
into political privileges and shut woman out, and do both&#xD;
in the name of inalienable right, for I certainly think&#xD;
every woman has a natural right to have her property&#xD;
represented in the general representation of property,&#xD;
and her person represented in the general representa-&#xD;
tion of persons. I know very well that men speak&#xD;
loftily and boastingly, and say women cannot manage&#xD;
the great affairs of a nation? Perhaps not. Govern-&#xD;
ment is political economy- national house-keeping.&#xD;
Does any respectable, sensible woman keep house~ half&#xD;
so badly as the government of the United States is kept?&#xD;
With so much bribery, so much confusion and corruption,&#xD;
so much quarreling in the domestic councils? I think not;&#xD;
for if such could be found her sex would be passing very&#xD;
severe strictures upon her. I have been not a little sur-&#xD;
prised, and indignantly so, too, that here, in the boasted&#xD;
land of universal freedom in the elective franchise, where&#xD;
it is said that there is no class of persons except crimi-&#xD;
nals and paupers who do not exercise the elective fran-&#xD;
chise, woman should be entirely excluded, not even re-&#xD;
cogniz~d as a 'class of persons;' they ~axe fairly dropped&#xD;
from the human race; for not to name her is in a dem-&#xD;
ocratic government to ignore her existence, treat her as&#xD;
a mere nonentity.&#xD;
'~Indeed, some of the most eminent European states-&#xD;
men and thinkers of the last century have argued against&#xD;
the doctrine of universal suffrage on the ground that it&#xD;
must, if consistently established, include women also.&#xD;
A celebrated French writer has said: 'To see one-half&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THR CONVENTION.&#xD;
of the human race excluded from~ all participation in&#xD;
government is apolitical phenomena which, on abstract&#xD;
principles, it is impossible to explain.' And yet here,&#xD;
where ~done the experiment of democracy is claimed to&#xD;
have been tried here, too, where all our institutions&#xD;
must stand or fall by their conformity to the great idea&#xD;
of equal rights.-.here where, moreover, politics are ex-&#xD;
istence, and exclusion from politics seems like exclusion&#xD;
from existence - but, even here, the~ fairest portion of&#xD;
society is strenuously excluded even from the most tri-&#xD;
fling participation, or voice, in the government; she is&#xD;
even watched with a very jealous eye, lest she overstep&#xD;
the bounds prescribed for her particular sphere of ac-&#xD;
tion. An English writer of some considerable preten-&#xD;
sions has summed the whole idea up, and embodied it&#xD;
in a single couplet where he says ~&#xD;
'Millions of throats will bawl for civil rights;&#xD;
No woman named!'&#xD;
"But, then, we Americans are so very polite to wo-&#xD;
men, and esteem the sex with such a wondrous gab&#xD;
lantry, almost entirely remarkable in our truly national&#xD;
chivalry; but it will take a good many bows and deli-&#xD;
cate homages to atone for this unexpected result of free&#xD;
institutions. With an almost sincere desire and awk-&#xD;
ward impulse of compensation, we attempt to atone for&#xD;
our fraud by excessive courtesies; withholding rights,&#xD;
we substitute favors.-.we rob woman of her claim to&#xD;
the soil she stands upon, and then, very courteously, beg&#xD;
leaye to offer her a chair as a recompense.&#xD;

&#xD;
man's eqnai rights and privileges, as only a relic of bar.&#xD;
barsim, handed down from the dark ages, when might&#xD;
gave right; when the husband treated his wife as he did&#xD;
his slate; (and I think it a very great pity they were&#xD;
allowed to have any;) but now, in the broad glare of the&#xD;
light of the nineteenth century, when we boast of our&#xD;
enlightened institutions, it were a very great stigma on&#xD;
our boasting if we do not endeavor to make amends in&#xD;
some degree for former injustice and detractions,&#xD;
"But, we are told, by woman's opposess' that she is&#xD;
not capable in intellect for all these things; the Creator&#xD;
has not endowed her with a talent for public stations;&#xD;
she is only fitted for private duties. But it is only a&#xD;
jealous want of liberality, or an ignorance of her inhe.-&#xD;
rent capabilities. Take woman's clear judging insight&#xD;
into character, added to the quick tact of her sex, once&#xD;
make it her interest to develop and cultivate her political&#xD;
talent, and bring her best energies, as man does, to&#xD;
bear on such subjects, and very many will very far&#xD;
transcend the other sex in several points of view. She&#xD;
possesses brilliance, wit, humor, eloquence, native adroit.&#xD;
ness, and alniost boundless ambition, in the brighter de-&#xD;
partments of mind; and, then, she has strength of mind,&#xD;
depth of reason, and acuteness of understanding, with&#xD;
&amp;amp; very clear perception of natural circumstances.&#xD;
"There are women who are the equals in intellect of&#xD;
any man who ever lived; and, comparing ordinary wo-&#xD;
'men with ordinary men, the varied though petty details&#xD;
'~which compose the occupation ~of women, call forth as&#xD;
much of mental' ability as the uniform routine of the&#xD;
pursuits that are the habitual occupation of a large ma-&#xD;
&#xD;
jority ~f men. it is from ~nothing in the faculties them-&#xD;
selves, but from th~ pefty subjects and interests on&#xD;
which alone they are exercised, that the companionship&#xD;
of women, such as the preseut circumsta~es mahe them,&#xD;
so often exercise a dissolvent infllueuce on high I~culties&#xD;
in men. It is not, then; for want of natural faculties&#xD;
or abilities, but only for want of proper objects of inter.&#xD;
est to call forth these fa cities; something ~m which to&#xD;
bend the whole strength of her energies and to call into&#xD;
exercise new talents, now lying entirely dormant for the&#xD;
mere want of pursuit. Once give woman an open field for&#xD;
the full exercise of her energetic, active mind, and the&#xD;
world will be astonished with the wondrous results.&#xD;
"But some of our opponanteadmit, freely, the entire&#xD;
equality of mental furnishing, but fty o~ the handle on&#xD;
the subject of utility or expediency. They are dread~&#xD;
fully afraid of tarnishing the extreme purity of woman's&#xD;
moral faculties; of lowering 'the standard of her finer&#xD;
feelings, those ethereal qualifications which'~render her&#xD;
an object of adoration, 'the seusilAlities and gentle affec-&#xD;

credit of having lull and entire faith that she can min-&#xD;
'gle with the world just as it is, and discharge all the&#xD;
duties that might be incumbent upon her, and take&#xD;
erery~ character just as she meets; give th~ good their&#xD;
full' meed of praise, and pase' by the bad withoutut con-&#xD;

ture'.-half creature, half divine-was in~so much dan-&#xD;
ger of contamination. He was of the opinion she&#xD;
would choose the good and cast the bad away; and he&#xD;
anticipated great results from woman's influence on&#xD;
man's ruder nature. There was no gentleman but what&#xD;
stood in awe of a lady of refined delicacy; they most&#xD;
certainly wonld have a gentle, refining influence on&#xD;
public assemblies.&#xD;
"The speaker was anxious, extremely anxious, to see&#xD;
the day arrive when Mrs. Smith, or Mrs. Jones; or&#xD;
Mrs. Brown, should be 'heard in the Senate Chamber,&#xD;
or he would bet- proud to number among his own.sup-&#xD;
porters, for some office in the gift of the people, a' long&#xD;
list of his lady friends; he should feel flattered by such&#xD;
support.&#xD;
"In conclusion, he would. like to hear the opinions, of&#xD;
some or all of these ladies on this resolution. He&#xD;
thought they might be expected to feel. a very deep in-&#xD;
terest in this whole subject; but he did so wish he had&#xD;
the eloquence of a Cicero or Demosthenes;. he never&#xD;
did.so wish to be eloquent as when he attended these&#xD;
meetings.. But, what few remarks he had 'made, were&#xD;
&#xD;
98&#xD;
&#xD;
the clear, honest convictions of a heart which beat every&#xD;
chord in unison with the cause of woman's rights."&#xD;
'Our bachelor friend having delivered himself, as Susie&#xD;
Grey said, of all his fund of extra knowledge, and a&#xD;
good deal more, sat down, evidently well pLeased with&#xD;
his effort, judging from the air with which lie adjusted&#xD;
his collar; apparently fancying that he had made quite&#xD;
an impression, at least in the marriageable portion of&#xD;
the 18 dies' department.&#xD;
The next speaker was a little, flutterin~, fidgel4ng&#xD;
thhg, with a little demure bunch of illusion ribbons,&#xD;
feathers, and French flowers, hanging on the back of&#xD;
the head, short clothes and gaiter boots; with a shrill,&#xD;
~queaking~ voice, only a little imperative. She seemed&#xD;
to rise with a considerable degree, of trepidation, but&#xD;
with a very proper artistic courtesy. She said&#xD;
"Mrs. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen; It is&#xD;
difficult to Oxpress the~ gratitude I feel to the friends&#xD;
who have expressedL so deep an interest in our behalf,&#xD;
expressed in the act of calling out this expression of&#xD;
the mind of the people; and I feel greatly 'encouraged&#xD;
by the large numbers I see assembled here* to-day to~&#xD;
gather, from their homes in widely differing sections of&#xD;
the country, for the purpose of discussing, in calm, quiet&#xD;
unanimity, a subject which is ere long, when it is once&#xD;
come to be understood, destined to enlist some of the&#xD;
best minds and talent in our whole country."&#xD;
Then the little speaker went off in a very animated&#xD;
strain t~ say how she did regret, and ~he believed she&#xD;
had the sympathy of many other very intelligent minds,'&#xD;

that this. subject h~l been so long permitted to sI~mI)er&#xD;
and sleep~ ~he believed it might have had a strong&#xD;
bearing on the cause of human freedom at large.. She&#xD;
thought the female character had long enough occupied&#xD;
a subordinate station; but she was constrained to 'be-&#xD;
lie that the other sex were just as anxious to see wo-&#xD;
men exercising their rights as she was to enjoy them..&#xD;
Then she said a great deal, in a very whining voice,&#xD;
about poor down-trodden woman, and about the ex-&#xD;
treme gallantry of gentlemen advocating their cause,&#xD;
(until $usie said she was real mad about her making&#xD;
out women such mere dependents, as if it were a mer-&#xD;
itorious act, of pure charity, for a gentleman to say any-&#xD;
thing in her behalf; she had a grand notion to get up&#xD;
and answer her herself;) and, then she talked very flu-&#xD;
ently about ladies filling offices with so much dignity&#xD;
and propriety-filling the ~9pits of churches, their&#xD;
voicLes, clear and silvery, circling up, up, to the domes&#xD;
of the edifice, and then sweeping down the broad aisjes&#xD;
in eloquent appeals.. ~he fancied woman's voice would&#xD;
yet be hoard re8ounding on the fio~r of Congress, or&#xD;
she would be seex~ filling the gubenu4oriai chair of some&#xD;
of these states, o~, it might be, gracing the white honse..&#xD;
Why n~t~ pi~ovi4ed the disabilities were taken away&#xD;
that surrounded her at present, and she were made&#xD;
eligible to such o~ces? $he said-and the little&#xD;
~igure seemed to dilate with the force of her own eJe~&#xD;
gance-remen~ber, woman wa~ n~ot taken from the head&#xD;
to rule, nor from the feet to be ruled, but she was taken&#xD;
froni the side to stand by man's side, as an equal in all&#xD;
thiiigs.&#xD;
&#xD;
TuB OONVBNTION.&#xD;
in conclnsi~n~she did sincerely hope those opinions&#xD;
would yet universally prevail.&#xD;
Many other speakers, both male and female, delivered&#xD;
themselves of sentiments very similar to what had al-&#xD;
ready been said. Several gentlemen made rout to gaa&#xD;
off quite an amount of extra gallantry;. making out, in&#xD;
the Lnost eloquent manner, th~t females are every whit&#xD;
their equals in. point of talent, judgment, energy, and&#xD;
all that, but are vastly man's superior in the world of&#xD;
sensation and sentiment; but the speaking was all on&#xD;
one side of the subject, there seemed to be no opposi-&#xD;
tion. The resolution finally passed almost by ~inani~&#xD;
mous consent.&#xD;
The second resolution was considered as so intimately&#xD;
connected with the first, that the arguments used in sup-.&#xD;
port of the fir~t had, with almost every speaker, run into&#xD;
a support of the second also; and it was passed also&#xD;
with scarce a dissenting voice.&#xD;
But the third resolution called up a different set ef&#xD;
Speakers; many gentlemen of intellect and cleai~ log-&#xD;
ical thought, of appreciation and penetration, capable&#xD;
of comprehending the import and bearing of any rela-&#xD;
tive subject that might be presented for theirs considers-&#xD;
tion and discussion, appeared as advocates for the res-&#xD;
olution. They all believed a perfect and entire equality&#xD;
of interests should exist between the parties ii' the mar-&#xD;
riage relation; and that the wife should have an equal-&#xD;
ity of property interest, in fee simple, disposable with-&#xD;
out the consent or operation of the husband-.-her's&#xD;
withQut his ability to give, or dispose of by will or oth-&#xD;
erwise.' Several speakers thought that strict justice de-&#xD;
manded this change in the legal descent of property.&#xD;

"And how did you like the doings of the convention,.&#xD;

"Oh, I think there ~was a vast deal of theory that I&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE EXPERIMENT.&#xD;
The morning rose bright and clear, only a filmy haze&#xD;
was just now gathering, that threatened to obscure its&#xD;
clearness, and gave to Nature's surroundings a slight&#xD;
lAnge of melancholy sadness, inclining pensive minds&#xD;
to a little serious reflection; just the beginI~ing for 6ne&#xD;
of those dreamy day~ when we feel like retrospecting&#xD;
the past. Nora had risen whIle t'he stars were yet visi-&#xD;

going out gradually in' the morning twilight; and the&#xD;
day stealing in apace. First, we see the dim outlines&#xD;
of distant objects4' then 'they"grow.ffiore' distinct, marked&#xD;
on the blue,~ ethereal s4, ~ntil the btoad glare of the&#xD;
god of day shows Nature in all her gorgeoits colotlri~&#xD;
of beauty. Nora was leaning on 'the railing of the&#xD;
balcony washing the receding stars, as they sank one&#xD;
by oie and were lost to 'vi~w, swallbwed up by the&#xD;
briglite~' effulgence of light, thinking of the time whi3n&#xD;
these same stars sang together, and listening t~ the&#xD;
gush of Nature's music;' so low: and musically si~eet.&#xD;
A's she listened thus; she inwardly exclairn~ed: "What &amp;amp;&#xD;

and flaps through the old deserted rooms, or sways the&#xD;
old casement, in such a mournful lullaby! And, too,&#xD;
what harmony there is in Nature; f~ her notes harmo-&#xD;
nize, and produce no discord 1"&#xD;
As Nora stands there, looking eagerly up, her figure&#xD;
standing out in bold relief against the eastern sky,~ she&#xD;
seemed a very picture. But, while Nora is standing&#xD;
there, almost entranced, another object is pictured on&#xD;
the scene. Running, almost flying, down the street, and&#xD;
tripping light as a gazelle up the broad steps of the&#xD;
balcony, comes a slight little figure, hatless, coatless,&#xD;
with a rosy, dimpled face and bright curling hair.&#xD;
Nora turned as the little figure came up, looking so&#xD;
pleasingly in her facet He ~said in almost breathless&#xD;
haste:&#xD;
"Oh! Miss Wilmot, won't you come and see my&#xD;
mother? Oh! won't you come and see my poor mother?&#xD;
Won't you come, leddy ?"&#xD;
"And who is your mother, my little man&#xD;
"Oh, she's Irish Biddy, she is; she's Biddy Mahon-&#xD;
ing, ~she is; and I's Michael Mahoning, I is. Oh! leddy,&#xD;
she's nigh almost dead, she is; oh I won't you come&#xD;
quick, leddy?"&#xD;
"Where do you live, Michael ?"&#xD;
"In the shanty, we does; and my poor mother's all&#xD;
alone, only the baby, ant she'll die, I know she'll die."&#xD;
"Stay a moment," said Nora, "until I get my bon-&#xD;
net," and the little son of the Emerald Isle looked his&#xD;
gratitude through his~ tears. INora tapped lightly on&#xD;
Susie's door, and found ~her already up, and her toilet&#xD;
completed. She said, dropping lightly into an arm&#xD;
chair;&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
"Susie, there is a most interesting Irish boy in the~&#xD;
balcony, who says his mother is. almost dead, and wants&#xD;
me to go and see her. I thought, per~ps, as it is so&#xD;
very fine a morning, you would like a walk, to give you&#xD;
an appetite for your breakfast."&#xD;
"Nora Wilmot, you are the most ridiculous girl I&#xD;
ever knew. Do you begin to suppose; because you have&#xD;
taken a fancy to turn Irish missionary, ~that k follows as&#xD;
a matter of course that Ii am to join in all your will.9'-&#xD;
the-wisp adventures? But, I presume, because I went&#xD;
to hunt up Mary Price, I am to be regularly installed&#xD;
into the Home Missionary department."&#xD;
"Oh, no, Susie; of course~ it is entirely optionary&#xD;
with yourself to go or not to go?'.&#xD;
"Well, in that case I think I shall option just not to&#xD;
go. Now, I fancy we would cut a braveiigtire, either&#xD;
of us, in an Irish shanty; wouldn't we, Nora ?'~&#xD;
"But we ought' not to let a fellow-being suffer, Susie,&#xD;
if' we have the means in our power of relieving them."&#xD;
'"Well, why didn't they stay in their own country,'&#xD;
then? We didn't send for them, that I know of."&#xD;
"But, you know, in their own country they are only&#xD;
worse off than they are here."&#xD;
"Well, judging from that sort of reasoning, I presuni4&#xD;
you will soon be going off on a missionary excursion to&#xD;
her Majesty's. dominions, to hunt up suffering humanity&#xD;
there."&#xD;
'.' Don't know but' what I might be worse employed.&#xD;
But we have invited 'them to our shores, and when they&#xD;
come, they are a part~ of our citizens; and although I&#xD;
believe they are a decided~ disadvantage to em' country&#xD;

"When will your father be at home, Michael? and&#xD;
I'll come round myself and tell him all ~bout it," said&#xD;
Nora.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, Miss led.dy, it's hem' too good of ye'sel&#xD;

* The sick woman rolled again uneasily upon her piP&#xD;
tow, and Nora going up to her, laid her hand soothing~&#xD;
ly on her forehead; it was throbbing with a burning&#xD;
fever. The woman was startled by the touch. Looking&#xD;
up with a wild. stare, she said: "What is it ye's want~&#xD;
ing here ?"&#xD;
"Only to do you some good," said Nora; "can't I&#xD;
do something for you ?" still leaning over her. "Are&#xD;
yoW~ery sick, nay good woman ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes; can't I he after havin' a wea throp, can't&#xD;
I ?" Nyra got a cup of cold water, and held it to her&#xD;
fevered' lips. She swallowed it eagerly, and then said in&#xD;
&amp;amp; coaxing tone, "Oh, leddy, its a wea throp of brandy&#xD;
I'd be after havin'."&#xD;
"No, no, my good woman, 'twill only aggravate your&#xD;
fever, and make you worse; let me cool your temples&#xD;
with 'a litle water," and Nora, good Samaritan as she was,&#xD;
bathed her head and temples, and cooled her burning&#xD;
&#xD;
palms, until she lay quite c6niposed, and seemed hi..&#xD;
dined to sleep. Nora watched beside her, cooling her&#xD;
fevered skin, until she uk ii4o a quiet slumber, and&#xD;
then stepped out to an -apothecary shop, to prQcure&#xD;
some soda and a portion of nitre. 'When she returned&#xD;
the invaljd still slept. Sitting down beside her, she&#xD;
waited until she awoke. When she awoke, Nora saw,&#xD;
with much delight, that she was ajinost entirely rational;&#xD;
but her fever seemed to be rising* again, and she 'again&#xD;
begged for "ji~t the wa'est throp of brandy, in some&#xD;
water." Nora said nothing, but going to the rude cup.&#xD;
board, mixed a portion of the soda, and gave it. to her&#xD;
instead. She looked almost daggers at her, but drank&#xD;
it in silence. Nora again sponged the fevered brow&#xD;
and hands, and applied a cooling draught to the head, and&#xD;
after preparing the nitre that Michael might administer&#xD;
it, she set it in a'-eonspicuous place, telling the little feb&#xD;
low, when his mother awoke and as1~ed for a drink, to&#xD;
give her some of that.&#xD;
He said he would, because there was no brandy now&#xD;
to giye her.&#xD;
Nora inwardly rejoiced that the sick woman would at&#xD;
least be free from its influence one day. And, telling&#xD;
Michael to be a good boy, and stay with his mother, ~and&#xD;
that she would be back in the evening, she left that&#xD;
abode of poverty more strongly impressed with the&#xD;
beauty and consistency of a life of temperance and so-&#xD;
briety. When Nora reached -home, after her protracted&#xD;
visit, Susie had a perfect shower of questions-about&#xD;
how Doctress Wilmot found her patient? how many&#xD;
times the howly St. Pathrick was, invoked? if she&#xD;

&#xD;
called upon the' Ilowly Mither? and if she didn't think&#xD;
she had better go out ott the railroad track and seek&#xD;
more business, some' more es of suffering human~&#xD;
Thy? Susie thinks if she "will only take the precan-&#xD;
lion to provide herself with a 'huge big bottle of the&#xD;
creature,, there might be a chance for some ~ery&#xD;
interesting cases." flut Nora ' only said, in her mild,&#xD;
cheerful way, that she 'h4'an engagement out for&#xD;
the evening, to visit 'another patient, in the same&#xD;
house. And she related at ~the dinner 'table, to her&#xD;
uncle, how she 'had 'disposed of the Irishman's "wea&#xD;
throp of brandy." '&#xD;
Uncle Grey said that was an act' of very summary&#xD;
judgment; he woul4 pronounce 'that seizure and confis-&#xD;
cation, ending with total destruction&#xD;
Aunt Grey was one of the fearful, doubting ones, that&#xD;
didn't believe in 'female action, and didn't care about ac-&#xD;
tion of any kind. ' Her own householdd had hitherto re-&#xD;
mained unscathed by this malicious influence, and so she&#xD;
felt an indifference on the subject. She was, however,&#xD;
afraid Nora would get herself into difficulty with these&#xD;
Irish Catholics, for they have no restraining influence,&#xD;
but would as soon abuse a woman as a man, so she&#xD;
thinks Mr. Grey had better accompany Nora, as she has&#xD;
promised to go.&#xD;
"Oh, no," Nora' said; "she was not one bit afraid&#xD;
but she 'would get 'along nicely, and she is going to 'get&#xD;
the Irishman and his'wife both to sign the pledge of 'to-&#xD;
tal abstinence ~ if they don't look very 'sharp."&#xD;
"If you do," said Uncle Grey, "yon certainly shall&#xD;
be dubbed leader 'of the Temperance canse in these&#xD;
&#xD;
parts,. that's certainm But I ' was just thinking we&#xD;
might take an idea from this pouring out of the brandy,&#xD;
that might be of service 'in ridding neighborhoods of&#xD;
these perfect nuisances,' where these drinking creatures&#xD;
get their liquor. There is nb law to protect these low&#xD;
dogger~es, that are a perfect disgrace to any community.&#xD;
But there is a very strenuous law,, if it ~was~ only at-&#xD;
tended to, to prevent the sale of liquors in small quantities.&#xD;
Susie said that she was "of opinion that Cousin Nora&#xD;
was hard-pressed for business, to be searching round&#xD;
Irish~ shanties for liquor. She presumed' it wouldn't&#xD;
be a very congenial business for an intelligent young&#xD;
lady of refined taste.; but 'every one to their liking.&#xD;
Nora' wanted her to go along, but she didn't just choose&#xD;
to 'go; didn't fancy such an~ adventure; it was a little&#xD;
too Quixotic for even her."&#xD;
"Well, Susie," said "her father, "if you don't choose&#xD;
to engage in any act of humanity yourself you should&#xD;
not find fault with those who do not think just as you&#xD;
do on~the subject; only bid them God-speed."&#xD;
"I'm not surprised in the least, father, that you take&#xD;
sides with Nora ; you always do."&#xD;
"Are you jealous, my dear ?"&#xD;
Not in the least, sir~; r always allow every person&#xD;
to~ think of me just as they; like, but reserving the same&#xD;
privilege, without 'fear or favor."&#xD;
"All right, my girl, all right; I ad mire your spirit,&#xD;
at all events; guess it all came honestly;' don't know&#xD;
but what you are a little bit like your father, 'my girl,"&#xD;
giving 'her a fond tap on the shonider, with a look o&amp;amp;"&#xD;
satisfied, affectionate admiration, and the happy father&#xD;
gave vent to such a free, heartfelt laugh. "But, Nora,&#xD;

&#xD;
I very much fear you will find it a somewhat dUYerent&#xD;
business~dealing with the Irishman, and he in all likeli-&#xD;
hood drunk, from what it was getting along with the&#xD;
woman, and her sick and partially delirious, and the&#xD;
child."&#xD;
"Well, Uncle, I'll tell you my plan. If the man is&#xD;
drunk, I'll get along as quietly as I can, but I'll tell&#xD;
him honestly what became of the brandy. I'll just&#xD;
make the most plausible tale I can, by telling him I&#xD;
found his wife in a high fever, and was afraid the child&#xD;
would give her some of the brandy, and greatly aggra-&#xD;
vate the disease, which in fact is every word true; but&#xD;
still ii had a higher purpose, which, of course, would&#xD;
not do to tell a drunken Irishman. It would be too&#xD;
much like 'casting pearl before swine.' But if I find&#xD;
him any thing like sober, I think, indeed I am pretty&#xD;
certain, I'll find the woman better, and if they are both&#xD;
any thing like sober and moderate, I intend to say&#xD;
something on the subject of temperance. J3ut I don't&#xD;
think it will do to say much at first: I believe if there&#xD;
is any thing done with such characters, it must be by&#xD;
taking just the right course, and not by being at all&#xD;
harsh."&#xD;
"Nora, I don't want to discourage you in the least,"&#xD;
said Uncle Grey, "but, I can assure you, I consider our&#xD;
foreign population as almost entirely hopeless on that&#xD;
point. I have' hope in almost any case where the sub-&#xD;
ject is native-born, but our German and Irish population,&#xD;
excepting a few very rare exceptions, are almost entirely&#xD;
hopeless. Why, do you know that one of the leading&#xD;
attractions, possessed by our country, to the emigrating&#xD;
&#xD;
T~E EXPERIMENT.              10'~&#xD;
Irishman, is the fact that w1ii~ky is plenty and cheap?&#xD;
Tobacco for the German and whisky for the Irishman&#xD;
seem almost indispensable necessities to existence. And&#xD;
not the least of the evil is that the women axe almost as&#xD;
much addicted to a fondness for 'a wea throp' as the&#xD;
men are, and a debased Woman is a far more formidable&#xD;
character than a debased man is; because society and&#xD;
its organizations require more purity in females than&#xD;
males. And it is essential for its well-being that it&#xD;
shall be so, because to females and their influence is&#xD;
mainly to be entrusted the training of the infant mind."&#xD;
~" Well, Uncle, if I cannot succeed in reaching this&#xD;
man's case, if I only succeed with his wife, 'twill not be&#xD;
labor lost, at all events, for I seemed to have been provi-&#xD;
den~ially led there by the hand of little Michael."&#xD;
Aunt Grey thinks an Irish shanty a most deplorable&#xD;
place for a young lady. ~' Why, Nora, I've heard it said&#xD;
they are almost' always alive with vermin, of the most&#xD;
revolting kind; and besides, Nora, you are in danger of&#xD;
meeting a troop of swearing, drunken creatures every&#xD;
time you go there. So I do hope you will not make&#xD;
another engagement of the same nature. If you want&#xD;
to labor in the cause of temperance, there is certainly a&#xD;
superabundance of business among our own native popu-&#xD;
lation."&#xD;
"Oh, yes," Uncle Grey said, "there is plenty of&#xD;
business in that quarter, and no kind of stint. There&#xD;
is that Oharley Price, that you girls seem so much&#xD;
interested in; I have been told that he has gone&#xD;
to drinking worse than ever; and has actually been&#xD;
known to al5use .his family in more than one instance."&#xD;
"Yes," Susie said, "she just expected that; she had&#xD;

just that much confidence in that Creature, and~ hot ~&amp;amp;ne&#xD;

ashamed, when we were there, that he wouldn't do ~o&#xD;
any more; but I didn't think so. I couldn't bear him,&#xD;
or any other man-AL don't ca;re what they. have been-~-.&#xD;
that would treat their family in any such manner. In-&#xD;

Ma~y Price is such ai pretty, nice little thing; and she&#xD;
tried so hard to hide everything on Chancy.. And then&#xD;
they have two such beautiful little children. They had&#xD;
such a comfortable home, with everything in. such fine&#xD;

confident of success-but her word was orit, ~nd she felt&#xD;
that she must:go.§ When she. reached;: the: rude shanty,&#xD;
Michael met her in the yard. .. . .&#xD;
"Oh ! bliss you, good leddy! my mother's any some&#xD;

"No, leddy, but mother says he'll be at home soons,&#xD;
what .he will, ant sure mother's afraid; what she is."&#xD;
&#xD;
"~.Oh,: she need not be afraid; I will stay tilL . your&#xD;

she found the woman sitting up, but looking very pale&#xD;
and weak.&#xD;
"How are you, my good woman?" asked Kora.&#xD;
"Oh, much better, thank ye, much better. Will ye&#xD;
hate a sate, will ye ?" .&#xD;
Nora~se~ted herself; as she was. bid, and then looked&#xD;
round ow the apartrhent.:. It was one of those rude&#xD;
board ~tri~ctures we ~ee scattered along the line of the&#xD;
public w~niks~1n every part of the country, scarcely high&#xD;
enough for a man to stand erect in, with a low doorway&#xD;
th&amp;amp;t required a considerable stoop to enter, and possess-&#xD;
ing .n&amp;amp; possible menns  5f ve~itilation: except the open&#xD;
door and the cracks and seams between the. boards, that&#xD;
served to ~dmi1t tlXe~irnrm~r'sbreeze as well asthe win-&#xD;
ter's storm. But, with her closest scrutiny, she could&#xD;
riot di~&amp;amp;wer one arti~le:. of either comfort or con-&#xD;
vonience. The apology for a bed was only a coarse&#xD;
mattress, covering a bed~; of straw, supported on some&#xD;
pble~, niade fast Th the wall of the house ~ while a&#xD;
beard, elected on pegs; formed the. only cupboard, With&#xD;
a few scant artides of cupboard ware, of the coarsest&#xD;
order,~t~o ~o1~ three ~ri~kety chairs, .and a box that seemed&#xD;
to answer the purpose 6f a t~tble, completed the visible&#xD;

"Oh, no, honey! not if we could be getting along as&#xD;
well in the old country. Oh !" she said, "Ireland&#xD;
was a fine country, but faith and there were too many&#xD;
peoples in it; thejr were too thick behalf; they couldn't&#xD;
be getting along; couldn't be getting enough till eat and&#xD;
something till live on. They couldn't be getting' any-&#xD;
thing till do, there was no work till be had. But in this&#xD;
country they could get plenty till do, if they would only&#xD;

in a suggestion. She said, "My good woman, perhaps&#xD;

"Well, now, Madam, you have done. without rum a&#xD;
part of 'the day, and your head is feeling better; try if&#xD;
you can't do without all day to-morrow."&#xD;
But the conversation was here interrupted by the ar-&#xD;
rival of Andrew Mahoning, the good man of the house.&#xD;
He came blustering up to the door, but drew back sur-&#xD;

THE EXPERIMENT.              111&#xD;
praised at seeing a. lady seated ~so composedly within his&#xD;
do~nicil. But Nora said "Good evening, sir," so kindly,&#xD;
he seemed re~issured, and, coming in, seated himself on&#xD;
one of the chairs. The man appeared-to be almost en-&#xD;
tirely sober, having no doubt reserved himself for the&#xD;
"wea throp" he expected to find when he came home,&#xD;
after his day's work was done. Poor Biddy was ill at&#xD;
ease, but Nora talked on very busy and very kindly,&#xD;
asking Andy a great many questions about the compara..&#xD;
tive merits of Ireland and America, just as if that had&#xD;
been all her business in coming. But she could see&#xD;
Andy's stock of patience was getting well nigh ex-&#xD;
hausted; his eye would be wandering towards the shelf,&#xD;
especially that particular locality where the black bottle&#xD;
stood, and Nora felt secretly ~mused at the thought of&#xD;
its contents; but, as she sat facing the spot where the&#xD;
bottle stood, he would not take it down while she sat&#xD;
there. Nora saw that she had gained one advantage&#xD;
already, for it was quite evident that both the man and&#xD;
woman were anxious to put the best appearance fore-&#xD;
most. But she 'thought best to move her seat to give&#xD;
Andy an opportunity to find out the mistake in the con-&#xD;
tents of the bottle, for she wanted 'him t&amp;amp; know before&#xD;
she left, and she thought her visit had been sufficiently&#xD;
protracted.&#xD;
Andy walked to the cupboard and took down the&#xD;
bottle, Nora all the time pretending not to see him.: He&#xD;
poured out some of the contents into a brown mug and&#xD;
drank it hastily, as if afraid o(heing seen; poured out a&#xD;
little more and tasted it, then turned round and looked&#xD;
at Biddy, ~s much as to say, "You drank it ;" but Biddy&#xD;

"Oh t it's no much matter, anyway,?' he said dryly,&#xD;

wishing she had~ not heen so very busy, for he well knew&#xD;
that Michael would not have dared done any such thing,&#xD;
and thou he wouldn't hav~ had to go to bed dry, as he&#xD;
seemed likely to under present arrangements. Nora&#xD;
thought she* would venture to~say a lit~1e more, as Andy&#xD;
seemed to take matters so very patiently. She. said:&#xD;
"Qh! Ikuew you would not care, so your wife was&#xD;

was fearful it was an attack of fever; but I gave her&#xD;
some soda and some nitre, and bathed her head well&#xD;
with cold water, and I found her much better this even-&#xD;
ing than I expected to see her But still I think it&#xD;
highly important that she shall be very particular about&#xD;
using anything stimulating; and she should be careful&#xD;
to keep very quiet for several days. And it might do&#xD;
her good to have a nice cup of tea, not too strong, with&#xD;
some nourishing diet. And I guess it will do you more&#xD;
good too, Andy, than, anything str~n.ger; won't it 7"&#xD;
"'Spect so," said Andy, a little dryly, as if it only came&#xD;
from the lips out, but as if the feelings didn't participate&#xD;
in the reply.&#xD;
"And then 'it will be so much better for your pocket."&#xD;
Nora said she would call again soon, and see how they&#xD;
were doing.&#xD;
Biddy said: "Oh! it would be so very kind, and she&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE WEDDING PREPARATIONS.&#xD;
"There is a fate that rules our destinies,&#xD;
Rough hew them as we will."&#xD;
The eventful week had at length rolled round that&#xD;
was appointed to make Susie Grey a bride. Just as&#xD;
Susie said, the longest day will have an end. With her&#xD;
characteristic impatience, she said it would be enough&#xD;
to try the patience of Job to have to wait for every-&#xD;
thing as she always had to do; if she was going to do&#xD;
anything, why, she always did want to do it, there was&#xD;
no kind of use in waiting. Susie says there is no kind&#xD;
Gf virtue in being too patient. True, she is not so very&#xD;
anxious to be married; doesn't, indeed, know that she&#xD;
shall be so very exquisitely happy; but, like all enthu-&#xD;
siastic temperaments, Susie likes a change, no matter&#xD;
what the nature of it is. But still, we think, there is&#xD;
some apology, if Susie does keep the whole house in&#xD;
an uproar, and disturb her father's quietude running&#xD;
here and flying yonder; it is only pet Susie, and nobody&#xD;
thinks anything of it; for they all know that it is&#xD;
already settled that AIf is to go to a distant part of the&#xD;
country, and her musical, ringing laugh will soon be&#xD;
missed from that happy household, and they all love to&#xD;
hear its bewitching melody now more than ever.&#xD;
As it is rather a privileged time at Uncle Grey's, we&#xD;
will take the privilege to ourselves of a peep into this&#xD;
quiet, cosy little boudoir, where we find Cousin Nora&#xD;
&#xD;
iete-a-tete with the bride elect over the important mat-&#xD;
ter of the bridal arrangements.&#xD;
"Well, Nora, ma says as it is the first child she has&#xD;
ever had married, and the only daughter except you,&#xD;
and you are going to be an old maid, you kr~ow, she&#xD;
will allow me to have all the arrangements. just to suit&#xD;
my own fancy. Now, what I came to consult you&#xD;
about is this: I want to know which you think will be&#xD;
the nicest, to have a grand party in the evening~ be&#xD;
married then, of course,-.--and set off on the cars in the&#xD;
morning for a bridal tou4~ or be married in the morning,&#xD;
with a few very select friends into breakfast, make the-&#xD;
trip just the same, and have a grand reception party on.&#xD;
our return? And then AIf has proposed either one of&#xD;
two routes: to take the northern route by the Lakes&#xD;
and the Falls, and a week at Newport, if we wish, and&#xD;
so on to Washington, or any other sights in that direc-&#xD;
tion which, you know, is the most common, every&#xD;
person goes that way; or to take the southern route&#xD;
through Virginia and over the Blue Ridge. Alf, you&#xD;
know, is a Virginian, and perhaps has a preference."&#xD;
"Will there he anything worth a visit in that direc~&#xD;
tion?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes; AIf says we could spend a whole season&#xD;
in the Ridge alone most agreeably. First, there are an&#xD;
innumerable amount of watering places: the warm&#xD;
springs, the hot springs, and the red, white, and blue&#xD;
sulphur springs; all, especially the two last, fitted up&#xD;
in superb style, for the accommodation of either inva-&#xD;
lids or pleasure seekers."&#xD;
"If you take that route, which class do you think our&#xD;
party had better be booked in, Susie?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Oh, Aif and me with the last class, of course; our&#xD;
afflictions will all be terminated then, and I presume&#xD;
will be about happy enough without being put in even&#xD;
with that class; but:.you and Fred will have to belong&#xD;
to the first class as invalids, suffering under a particular&#xD;
malady, no matter what, but may premise that you&#xD;
won't be in much need of a physbzian. Well, that is&#xD;
enough nonsense-now let us attend to business awhile.&#xD;
In the same state there is the Natural Bridge."&#xD;
"I have always wished to visit that," said Nora.&#xD;
"Well, we'll go that way. then, won't we, Nora? It&#xD;
will be something so~ entirely. new. I shouldn't be at all&#xD;
surprised if it -creates quite a sensation in the fashion-&#xD;
able world.~ I never did like to do just like everybody else&#xD;
does. I like to strike out a new path once in a while,&#xD;
,just for my own feet to tread in, even if nobody else&#xD;
does tread in it. Well, what say you, Nora? You must&#xD;
have some say, as you are to be one of the party. Will&#xD;
we go north or south?"&#xD;
"If I am to have a vote, though I don't wish to be&#xD;
considered a~ having any slavery proclivities, I think&#xD;
I shall vote for the south all the time in that choice."&#xD;
"Well, I think so too, and so the matter of the route&#xD;
is settled ~ buV we haven't settled the time for the big&#xD;
party yet. The whole matter with me is whieh will be&#xD;
the most unique, the most different from the common&#xD;
order? I want to have a good time; perhaps it will&#xD;
be the last."&#xD;
"What made you say that, Susie."&#xD;
"Oh, I just happened to think it, and, you know, we&#xD;
don't any of us know anything about what the uncertain&#xD;
future will be reading for us."&#xD;

"Do you want my opinion, Susie? (Susie had beeii&#xD;
sitting sometime patting her foot, looking very abstract-&#xD;
edly, and humming, 'Oh, for a home in a-cottage.') I&#xD;
think the breakfast party and reception both the nicest&#xD;
and the most unique."&#xD;
"Well," said Susie, starting up, "think I'll adopt it;&#xD;
don't we settle business in diplomatic style, now don't&#xD;
we? Then if we adopt the morning rule, we must have&#xD;
bridal dresses for the morning, traveling~ dresses, and&#xD;
party dresses; but the party dresses can be got up&#xD;
while we are gone. Then we will have orange flowers&#xD;
for the bridal morning and for the party. too." And&#xD;
the little head seemed only bent on the important mat..&#xD;
ter of having all things in magnificent - order for the&#xD;
grand event, that ought to be important in more than&#xD;
external fixtures and arrangements; but still humming~&#xD;
gay tune, unmindful that the world has aught but&#xD;
"bright smiles and sunny weather." Before Nora had&#xD;
time t~6 bring her mind to bear on the subject of dress,&#xD;
Susie had tripped oft; singing on a high key, "Oh, this&#xD;
is a fair world to me," and making the wide halls&#xD;
resound with her clear-, happy voice~ Happy will it be&#xD;
if she can always be as light hearted; a~4 Nora sighed&#xD;
as she thought of the uncertainty of all human calen-&#xD;
lations~ for it had seemed to her, despi&#xD;
ity she could bring to bear on the subje o all to&#xD;
her aid in the matter, that there was ai~ ~ strict&#xD;
moral rectitude about Alfred iRayburn, that did not&#xD;
augur well for his future prospects; but perhaps it&#xD;
grew out of the fact that Susie had told her that he oci~&#xD;
casionally indulged in ~a. social glass in a gentlemanly&#xD;

way; but she thought it best to hold her peace and for-&#xD;
bear any advice, for, as she said, Uncle Grey has a far&#xD;
better knowledge of the world than she has, and a bet-&#xD;
ter and more intimate knowledge of the probabilities of&#xD;
Uayburn's future prospects. And they all had, except&#xD;
Uncle Grey, (and he only said Nora had a right to act&#xD;
as her own judgment dictates, for he considers her fully&#xD;
competent to form her own opinions,) so entirely op-&#xD;
posed her course with regard to Morley, and treated&#xD;
her objection as ~so entirely absurd -calling her Lucy&#xD;
Stone, old fogy, too particular, and too fastidious.&#xD;
Nora felt just then, amiable as her nature was, she felt&#xD;
just then as if she might be excused, provided every&#xD;
thing didn't end well, in saying, "I told you so." And&#xD;
Nora sat there watching the slant rays of the evening&#xD;
sun as they shot back golden arrows of light and beauty,&#xD;
illuminating the apartment with a borrowed brilliance&#xD;
not its, own, aud medallioning the western clouds with&#xD;
coruscations of purplecriinson and bright burnished gold,&#xD;
so like the hopes that earth gives, bright but so tran-&#xD;

"Oh! fie, my boy, it's too soon, 'tirely ioo soon, to&#xD;
think of making any kind of calculations on that sub-&#xD;
ject for the future; must certainly wait till the honey-&#xD;
moon is well over; but you don't even mean to insinuate&#xD;
that you would wish to govern your wife when you get&#xD;
one?"&#xD;
Well, sir, I don't intend that she shall govern me,&#xD;
that's flat."&#xD;
"No call for either, sir, not in the least ; you just&#xD;
govern yourself and allow her the same freedom of ac-&#xD;
tion and will, and there will be no cause for a clashing&#xD;
of interests."&#xD;
"Well, sir, as we are on that subject, I would like to&#xD;
hear your opinion of what would be done, provided&#xD;
some matter comes up in which both parties are equally&#xD;
interested and requiring a decision?"&#xD;
"Well, then, just settle it by each one being anxious&#xD;

&#xD;
jnst such an one. I'll find a woman of plain, practical,&#xD;
good sense, and that well cultivated; not merely the&#xD;
outside fixture of a prescribed term at -a fashionable&#xD;
boarding school, where the instruction "is all rubbed on&#xD;
the outside," as some of Mrs. Stowe's characters say,&#xD;
but where the head and heart, the understanding, and&#xD;
* the affections, by study, practically applied by observa-&#xD;
tion"&#xD;
"Yes, Morley, and when you find such women they&#xD;
are sure to be too masculine, too strong-minded, want-&#xD;
ing to be just like men, going spouting round the coun-&#xD;
try, in favor of making men like women and women&#xD;
like men; and I do hate such things~ I can't abide&#xD;
them. I want to see each sex fill just the sphere Prov-&#xD;
idence designed them to fill; but I admire an intelli-&#xD;
gent or even a learned woman, just as much as you do,&#xD;
sir, provided she is woman-like, knows her own sphere,&#xD;
and is willing to and content to keep it. But I am not&#xD;
one of your half fools that think just because woman's&#xD;
sphere is different from man's, that it follows, as a thing&#xD;
of course that her talents, or her sphere, or her capa-&#xD;
bilitie         Va inferior to man's. Neither . do I&#xD;
oes not rule in church or state, be-&#xD;
te, and is not eligible to office, that&#xD;
station is a subordinate one, or that&#xD;
* Woman does rule, and that too&#xD;
ce is felt, in every ramification of socie-&#xD;
ty.- She governs at the reside; which, in my opin-&#xD;
ion, is the fountain-head of all government, civil, relig~&#xD;
jous, or military, I believe I may soy. A very learned&#xD;
man has said, 'Give rn.e th9 training of the infant&#xD;
&#xD;
mind, the first ten years, and you may haye the govern-&#xD;
ing of the nation.' I don't often express. my whole&#xD;
opinions freely on this subject, because I don't believe&#xD;
~iny opinions would be at all popular, and there is no&#xD;
particular call for an open expression of them. It is&#xD;
my honest conviction that the whole power of the gov-&#xD;
ernment that is worth calling by the name Qf power~ is&#xD;
nominally in the hands of women. I know there is&#xD;
a deal of trickery, and humbuggery, and dodging, that&#xD;
goes by the name of power or government- but when&#xD;
you come to search for it as a principle, a reality, an&#xD;
independent idea, a true source of action, why, sir, it&#xD;
isn't there; its only a name, a mere flash, an empty&#xD;
shadow, gained by him who can furnish the greatest&#xD;
amount of shining stuff to bury it with. But 'tis female&#xD;
influence that forms the public mind; sh~ trains the&#xD;
presidents, and governors, and senators, and rules in&#xD;
both church and state; and, you know, it i~ said, and I&#xD;
think with a degree of truth ioo, that 'just as the twig&#xD;
is bent the tree is inclined ;'. and divine orthodoxy says,&#xD;
'train up a child in the way he should go, and when ~ie&#xD;
is old he will not depart from it.' I&#xD;
that throws a powerful responsible&#xD;
cause the training of the infant&#xD;
placed measurably in her hand&amp;amp;"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Well, Fred, II do think you- are troubled with -the&#xD;
most exquisitely fantastical set of what-do-you-call-'erfls&#xD;
that I ever knew.. I'll ~tell you what, sir, I think you&#xD;
are very much lika the old beau I've heard of, that&#xD;
courted a young-widowaud when told by a friendthat&#xD;
the widow WQuldU't have him, said, 'Oh! dear me, I am&#xD;
so love-cracked I can't live if. she don't5" I think, your&#xD;
case must be very similar, ~&#xD;
"Not altogether ~so bad, sir; but I'll tell you what is&#xD;
so: I think Miss -Wilmot is a very splendi~l girl,. quite&#xD;
t~bove the comn~on order."&#xD;
"l3ut I 4on't think her half so good, looking as my&#xD;
little ~nsie, and not half as. brilliant either.'?&#xD;
"Wouldn't expect it of you, sir, wouIdn'~ expect it;&#xD;
don't even want- yQ~t to~ think so; shan't, have a bit&#xD;
worse opinion of you. for that declaration. Now I'm&#xD;
going to tell you a secret, Rayburn: I think there are&#xD;
prettier girls th~rn Miss Wilmot ever was, but then ~.J1&#xD;
think she i~ very wel.l looking"&#xD;
"Navo, sir! Let's hear what the great attraction is&#xD;
then, that draws so like a magnet."&#xD;
~ it is a fund of native good sense, prop.,&#xD;
orly ,reading of the right selection, corn-&#xD;

ions % . ~and still, ~he is entirely woina~ily, -not a&#xD;
whit znasiu ilie, or inan-Jike, as you, say, Rayburn; en~&#xD;
tirely satisfied to confine herself to the sphere of wo-&#xD;
man's ~roper station. And then there is a freshness&#xD;
r&#xD;
~nd eiie~?gy, a buoyancy of thought; an e4ensive corn-&#xD;
pr~hensiou of i4ea~and principles, that I neyer, saw&#xD;
&#xD;
combined in one character.. She is -to me like a book or&#xD;
an author that I can't read through at one -sitting, but&#xD;
still I like' the entertainment well enough to- come back&#xD;
for another sittings and t always find something, that I.&#xD;
have not discovered before; ~and yet there is an "art..&#xD;
lessiie~s and an innocence, a\seeming unconsciousness of&#xD;
her own superior powers, that I can't choose but&#xD;
admire."&#xD;
"' Didn't I tell you, Morley, your' ease was like the&#xD;
old gentleman lover '? And so, and sob' we will' have to&#xD;
set this down as chapter first in the history-of Miss&#xD;
Nora's praises."        '  '    '           -&#xD;
"Yes, sir, the first but not the last."&#xD;
"When will you again hold forth on the 'subject, for&#xD;
we may presume it is not exhausted- yet, and I am ~iix-&#xD;
k~us to be in at the next hearing ?" -&#xD;
"Only merely broached, sir; I tell you her mind is &amp;amp;&#xD;
casket of rare gems of exquisite workmanship." -&#xD;
"Well,' 'Fred, if this be indeed;- a true picture, you&#xD;
might well consider yourself a lucky fellow, if yi~~ can&#xD;
only carry off the priceless treasure with even a second~&#xD;
trial." ' -&#xD;
"And even so will I consider it; I shalt ider it a&#xD;
happiness to make' it a life-long study - ~yseW&#xD;
worthy of such a woman."&#xD;
"I'd like to know who is the enthir~iosti now, Mor-&#xD;

"Oh, 'pon honor, man, I thought you seemed to&#xD;

CHAPTER Ix.,&#xD;
THE BRiDAL EXCURSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I never saw a bridal but my eyelids hath been wet;&#xD;
It always seenigd the saddest sight of all,&#xD;
To see a gay and girlish thing lay aside her maiden gladiioss,&#xD;
,For a name aiid for a ring2'&#xD;
The morning was one of those still, dreamy ones,&#xD;
when all nature seems hushed into a listening attitude,&#xD;
wheu morning seems to love to linger in thelap of night,&#xD;
as if 'twei'e a real luxury to slumber in her dewy em~&#xD;
'brace. The sun, too, emerged lazily from the bosom of&#xD;
the Atlantic, his broad disk at the first shaded by a thin&#xD;
curtain of smoky haze, which gave him the appearance&#xD;
of a ball of liquid fire;' but as he ascended majestically&#xD;
and shook the curtain oft~, of mist' and spray, arid robbed&#xD;
nature of her Ilewy petals, nature was smiling back a&#xD;
gracious welcome.&#xD;
The little party that had met at Uncle Grey's *~lmost&#xD;
before day had well dawned, had looked on a' scene of&#xD;
gay solemnity; Mr. Grey, in his 'calm, commanding&#xD;
dignity, but with a voioe tremulous with agitation, has&#xD;
given away to the care of another the sunlight of his&#xD;
household. And she, the petted one, the idol of her&#xD;
father, the pet of her mother, the gentle companion and&#xD;
favorite of her brother, has given up father, and mother,&#xD;
and loving brother, and the home of her youth and&#xD;
childhood, and cast all her hopes of happiness on one&#xD;
loving 'hearl. And'he, in trusting confidence ~haS taken&#xD;

&#xD;
in the sight of Heaven, promising to be to her a faithful,&#xD;
loving husband, until death should separate them. Was&#xD;
it not solemn, such ~ scene ?t And ~hcdkr kindly, affection-&#xD;
ately does the new-made husbar~d regard his trust, the&#xD;
little, fragile, trusting creature that stands at his side,&#xD;
with such~a child4ike simplicity, so believing a&#xD;
as if she said, looking up into his eyes to. read&#xD;
the response, "'Tis all thine.-have' I not gi~.ren all 'I had&#xD;
to thee? See thou betray not the trust,, for is it, not a&#xD;
sacred one?"&#xD;
And tears were on the manly cheeks o~ her father,&#xD;
and Mrs. Grey has to avert her face lest she may, mar&#xD;
the gayety of the scenes for, with all its deserved solei~-&#xD;
nity, there aie gay hearts in that assembly. Why,, who&#xD;
ever saw a solemn wading?, .~ 'Tis only solemn to age.&#xD;

can.-~~.-let them fancy the ~worJd is all moonshine-.--for I&#xD;
would not cloud one ~youthful brow with care, or . t~ll&#xD;

of a happy, heart where sorrow has alwafrs beeu~~ a&#xD;

Bu the shrill.7 whistle of the locomolve ~8. heard, and&#xD;
all is bustle, for the cars. Once seated. in the well-cush-&#xD;
ioned, luxurious seats,, $u~ie seemed to have forgotten&#xD;
the tearful eyes. she had left. behind, and to have given&#xD;
herself up to4he happiness of the moment. Once she&#xD;
said: "Eow, ii would: have liked , brother Mark to have&#xD;
been along; but poor ma and pa wQnld have been s~&#xD;
lonel y;"~ and. a slight sigh escaped her. The quick ear :of&#xD;
affection noticed it in. a1 moment,.,auda hand 'is gently&#xD;
laid on the little round shoulder with a "My dear,&#xD;
whence. that sigh?"&#xD;
Witl~ a sweet smile she said: ~" Oh! Wwas a sigh sent&#xD;
back home ;" and the k~ving head is nestled on the&#xD;
manly arm by her side, and in a moment more Susie is&#xD;
herself again.. All is merry, joyous,. happy, because&#xD;
Susie is such a gentle, sunny creature, with a witching&#xD;
fascination in her clear blue eyes,. her pouting lips, and&#xD;
happy: laugh,' that ~ouiids just, now, as I listen to. its&#xD;
thoughtless' tnelody, like a long, rich strain of heart~&#xD;
music; and now her cheerful gayety isa real bonta~ion,&#xD;
for all are as ~' merry as a marriage bell."&#xD;
.They had just stopped for a change of c~rs, 'and Nora7s&#xD;
watchful eye had noted an interestiug.party just come ou&#xD;

fiiwe, that would else have been handsome; rwore an un-&#xD;
wonted~flnsh; and Nora thought she detected a slight&#xD;
irregularity in the step that would have been manly and&#xD;
dignified. his companion, a beautiful woman of not more&#xD;
than eighteen summers, who had scarce lost her girlish&#xD;
look) carried in~her. arms a sweet babe, whose violet eyes&#xD;
had only opened on some six months, but whose infan-&#xD;
tile features were interwoven so completely ~iththe looks&#xD;
of both the other travekrs, that Nora thQught she could&#xD;
read so much of the history of the family. They were&#xD;
father, mother and their first born-.--and an interesting&#xD;
trio they formed, sitting side by side, with the little&#xD;
heart4reasure, their all, apparently absorbing all their&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
The cars were under full speed when the company&#xD;
noticed that the strange gentleman was growing very&#xD;
loquacious - talking to every person that chanced to&#xD;
come within the sphere of his notice, in a very discon~&#xD;
nected, wild manner. It was apparent to all presentthat&#xD;
he must be laboring under some mysterious influence&#xD;
that was stealing away his senses.&#xD;
But that gentle being at his side, what did she?&#xD;
What could she do but endeavor to soothe him into qui-~&#xD;
* etude, and try by every means her ingenuity could de-&#xD;
vise to keep the sweet innocent in her arms from its nat-&#xD;
ural guardian, for he still kept insisting on. holding it,&#xD;
bfe was so very anxious lest she should be wearied hold-&#xD;
ig it; and'then he' was so very loving to herself; he&#xD;
must kiss her cheek and throw his arms around her neck,&#xD;
and call 4er by a thousand most endearing names.~ Her&#xD;

&#xD;
cheek was all blanched, and her lip colorless~-.!. the rose&#xD;
had faded before her deep mortification~ 'and she looked,.&#xD;
the very picture of mental distress~ And this deep&#xD;
agony sh&amp;amp; must bear from him who had vowed to love&#xD;
and cherish her even until death, and she had left father&#xD;
and mother, sister and L~rother, ~and gone out from the&#xD;
sheltering protection of childhood's home with him1&#xD;
"her choice in love's bright morn ;" and with woman's&#xD;
trusting~ confidence, is willing, even now, to cross the&#xD;
globe with him, nor once shrink from privations7 or trials,&#xD;
or labors, or even disgrace, if the chosen one were by&#xD;
her side. -&#xD;
Gradually the bus~r tongue grew ~ilent, the eyes closed,&#xD;
the head~ drooped, and the deep sonorous breathing indb&#xD;
cated heavy sleep. The young wife seemed i~ little re~&#xD;
lieved-. the babe slept upon her bosom, but she was dis-&#xD;
tressed lest the irregularity in the motion of the cars&#xD;
should interrupt her sleeping husband. Laying down the&#xD;
slumbering infant by her side, and then, with a wife~s de~&#xD;
motion, she put her slender arm around him to protect&#xD;
him from danger, seeming albunconscious of the obser-&#xD;
vations of~he curious, only intent on protecting the&#xD;
jewels of her own hearth-stone; for to ~her, inebriate a&amp;amp;&#xD;
he was, he was all the, world, the idol of her ~onng&#xD;
heart. Of all that crowded car, scarce an eye ~Iooki~&#xD;
on that scene witk indiffere7nce.-.--and many a s~rainger&#xD;
cheek was moistened with the ~dews, of sympathy.&#xD;
When they reached the station, and the cars were4~&#xD;
be changed, the poor wife lo@ed first atone passenger&#xD;
and then at another so pleadingly, but all.turned away&#xD;
with apparent indifference,, as much. &amp;amp;s if to say: "'Tis&#xD;

not 'in~y~ business; if I don't hurry P11 "miss the right~&#xD;
train." She looked in Mc~j1ey's face so. pleadingly, as&#xD;
the tears coursed down her blanched cheeks.' Nora saw&#xD;
the look, and turning to Morleysald "Can't you help&#xD;
the poor'thin~ ?"' but at that 'inomeat two benevolent&#xD;
lookin~g'gentlemen, of middle age, stepped forward and&#xD;
proffered their aid. But that railroad scene. was 'not&#xD;
lost on all who witnessed it. Alf Rayburn acknowledged&#xD;
to himself that Nora Wilmot is not' so very far from&#xD;
right after all.&#xD;
But now our party are among the moux~tains, and our&#xD;
Kora and Mrs. Susie, as Nora insists on calling her, are&#xD;
in~ raptures with the mountain scenery,.~ as they stand&#xD;
viewing the scene 'before thexn~:rising peak ahove peaks&#xD;
towering into the ethereal vault above, piling back, back~&#xD;
and up, up, *until the eye is lost in the distance, and trees&#xD;
dwindle to' mere shrubs. How insignificant seemed all&#xD;
man's attempts at neatnesss I Nature, without so much&#xD;
as ~an effort, has outdone it all!&#xD;
Ag' they stood, still watching the blue outline, dis~&#xD;
tinct~y marked on the horizon, Nora laid 'her hand on&#xD;
Susje~s arm. Pointing to the distance, she s~&amp;amp;id, "Yon-&#xD;
der they rise, those mountain heights , just ~s I fancy the&#xD;
mountain heights of Judea rise, pointing to the Eternal&#xD;
City."&#xD;
"'~Th~re you are 'again, Nora, off after some fanciful&#xD;
vision. Wonder you 'don't 'fancy yourself called on W&#xD;

the shotdderf each, and said gayly, "N6w, can't yo~&#xD;
imagine the Eternal City, just beyond that line of blue,&#xD;
so clearly defined yonder ?"&#xD;
It was the first time he had ever i~ed so much free-&#xD;
dom, and Nora felt her face crimson to ~the very temples.&#xD;
But, as Morley looked into her ingenuous countenance,&#xD;
their eyes met, and he thought he read more than.he&#xD;
e'~er read before. He fancied that look came from deep&#xD;
sown, from the very fountain of her feelings, and that&#xD;
there was a fountain opened that had never been stirred&#xD;
before. S4~si0~'too, was silently taking notes. She had&#xD;
some time suspected that Nora ~was not altogether in-&#xD;
different on that matter, and ~she felt inwardly gratified.&#xD;
Rayburn coming up; joined the little party, as they&#xD;
stood there enjoying the evening. Offering his arm to&#xD;
Susie; he said, k~okin~ ba4* with a most gracious bow,&#xD;
"I would be very polite, Miss Wilmot, but, you know,&#xD;
1' 'aim 'no "longera~ free man. Under a little restraint&#xD;
now. Fear this 'little~~gypsy might take a fancy to turn&#xD;
jealous, by way of: variety. "&#xD;
But Snsie'~nly shook her linger quizically at Morley,&#xD;
Who was just then assisting: Nora to throw a shawl&#xD;
around h~r shoulders~ Rayhurn and 'Susie seemed in-&#xD;

&#xD;
so very anxious to know, won't it be considered an&#xD;
apology this time?&#xD;
Morley said, looking into Nora's face inquiringly,&#xD;
"Miss Wilmot, can you trust me now? I feel it will&#xD;
be a pleasant task to make a life-long effort to make&#xD;
myself worthy of your confidence."&#xD;
* Nora felt the manly arm on which she leaned tremble,&#xD;
and, as she looked into the open, intelligent countenance,&#xD;
she felt an inward consciousness that Fred Morley could&#xD;
be trusted.&#xD;
We don't know precisely what answer Nora gave,&#xD;
but we know both Fred and Nora were in the very best&#xD;
of spirits imaginable the balance of the evening. Mrs.&#xD;
S~isie said they seemed quite entirely as happy as a&#xD;
couple just married, enjoying their first trip. You&#xD;
know she has a right to judge, for she is pretty well&#xD;
posted.&#xD;
The novelty of the mountain scenery was beginning&#xD;
to cloy a little, and they were tiring of the crowd of&#xD;
strange faces, as they had now spent some time at a&#xD;
fashionable watering place, amid the varied scenes of&#xD;
amusement and dissipation usually to be met with at&#xD;
such places. IRayburn said he must show them another&#xD;
freak of Nature's handiwork in the Old Dominion.&#xD;
So it was soon settled that they would set off for the&#xD;
Natural Bridge in the morning, but a few hours' drive&#xD;
from their present stop.&#xD;
Our travelers were up with the lark for an early&#xD;
start. The ladies made choice of a coach and four, as&#xD;
there was no public conveyance, and Susie said she&#xD;
liked to all ride together; it would be so much more&#xD;
social. The day is one of those unclouded ones pecu-&#xD;

depth of blue amounting almost to violet, and not a&#xD;
cloud is seen to break or mar the mighty dome of&#xD;
cerulean blue. And the air is balmy as Italia's, as~&#xD;
they rode along the base of the ridge, now gliding along&#xD;
over a perfectly smooth distance of fine sandy stu'face,&#xD;
then over a considerable spur of the rocky cliffs that&#xD;
towered high above their beads and sunk again in deep&#xD;
gorges, often termimtting in one of those beautiful&#xD;
mountain torrents that dash and roar with such impetu-&#xD;
osity through those deep mountain passes7 that give to&#xD;
mountain scenery one-half its sublimity and grandeur.&#xD;
They stopped a moment in one of the pebbly&#xD;
streams that seemed in such haste to join the great&#xD;
flood that is hastening to the sea like mortals hastening&#xD;
to the sea of Eternity. Nora, raising her finger, said,&#xD;
pointing to the pine trees that towered high above their&#xD;
heads, in a ceaseless agitation with the slightest breeze,&#xD;
"There was a mournful monotony in the music of their&#xD;
restless leaves, contrasting strangely with the hurrying&#xD;
rush of the busy torrent." All seemed listening with a&#xD;
breathless interest.&#xD;
Rayburn said, pointing to the water and then to the&#xD;
scene above, "This, then, is Nature's harmony 1"&#xD;
Nor~, said, "No, no! this is only one of her dis-&#xD;
cords."&#xD;
Just below where they stood the mountain torrent&#xD;
had scooped for itself a hollow basin, sufficiently large&#xD;
to form, one of those bewitching,, tiny mountain lakes,&#xD;
so often met with in such scenery, and universally in~&#xD;
habited by an iunumei~able. quantity of choice fish1 fur-&#xD;

luxury that the denizens 'of the more level arabic lands&#xD;
are almost strangers to.&#xD;
* Sitting on the bank of this miniature lake, they saw a&#xD;
most unique looking being, holding a 'fishing rod, with&#xD;
a long line attached, just within the water's edge. The&#xD;
man wore a hat of coarsest straw, almost rimless, an&#xD;
outer garment made' after the hunting shirt order, and&#xD;
feet without either sandals or. boc~s~&#xD;
But Nora's' inquisitive eye had been busy in detecting&#xD;
a long black bottle, laying high and dry upon the beach,&#xD;
secure from :all danger', as the owner thought, no doubt,&#xD;
for it' was stored away so' very carefully, between the&#xD;
projecting r~ots of an 'old chestnut stump, accompanied&#xD;
by a little bunch of something done up for a cold luneh&#xD;
for dinner.&#xD;
Nora said 'she "would like' so 'well to get an oppor~&#xD;
tunity to empty the contents of' that 'bottle, an4~fil1 it&#xD;
up with pure Adam's ale. It would be such a real&#xD;
kindnesB to the old fisherman's stomach."&#xD;
Rayburn' said they would have 1~rst to empannel a&#xD;
jury to try the present contents, and if it was proved&#xD;
'guilty of belig a nuisance to the commonwealth, then&#xD;
they might proceed to seize, confiscate and destroy.&#xD;
Nora said she didn't care if they did try it, so~ the&#xD;
S&#xD;
old fisherman wasn't chosen juryman. But our fisher-&#xD;
man was too intent on his occupation to have noticed&#xD;
'the bridal party, although they were but a short dis-&#xD;
tance froM hfin~ While they were considering his case,&#xD;
lie nioved' his position a little 'farther off, and s6 sit-&#xD;
uated that a high bluff intervened between him: and&#xD;

the road running along smoothly over a little rise,? not&#xD;
large enough to dignify with' 1~he tifie of hill.&#xD;
Morley said, after straining his eyes in every possible&#xD;
direction1 "Ladies, it is clearly my opinion Mr~ Ray-&#xD;
burn's inexpressibly happy state of mind has betrayed&#xD;
him into an error in the season. He is thinking it is&#xD;
'the first of April."&#xD;
"Not at all, sir. I know just the particular locality&#xD;
of the year we are in, and am 'not even joking."&#xD;
- There was another general survey of the landscape,&#xD;
with no better success than before, when Rayburn said,&#xD;
Ladies; we are all actually standing on the -grand&#xD;
structure, erected by the hand of Omnipotence" -&#xD;
All started' in 'evident surprise' and astonishmeuL&#xD;
They had been anticipating something towering up, like&#xD;
a vast pyramid, or mountain hight. But, instead,&#xD;
everything seemed se entirely easy and natural; the&#xD;
road running over the little eminence just as any other&#xD;
road did. - -&#xD;
* But when they passed' under the mighty arch, and&#xD;
looked up to the truly wonderful structure, arching the&#xD;
expanse so 'entirely, supported by the rocky pillars of&#xD;
Nature's own piling-masonry whose solidity will never&#xD;
give way-and the lithe stream, murmuring so uneon-&#xD;
scionsly at its very base, .~ll stood in mute wonder.&#xD;
1~Iv'ery thing seemed so entirely different from any thing&#xD;
built by the handiwork of' man. It was all grand, mag-&#xD;
iiiflcent, wonderful and picturesque, yet rude - and na-&#xD;
tural.&#xD;
Nora said, if this structure had spanned the Ohio, or&#xD;
Mississippi, all - other structures would have sunk - iut~&#xD;
entire insignificance when compared to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BRIDAL EXCURSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
But Mrs. Rayburn said she thought it was a very&#xD;
rocky concern, and not at all to be undermined soon;&#xD;
but, then, a little chiseling and dressing wiuld add&#xD;
greatly to its beauty.~ She says the flower~, and shrubs,&#xD;
and evergreens, that grow all up its sides, and the trail-&#xD;
ing vines that cling to the fissures of the rocks, and are&#xD;
matted on their sides, running over the trees and shtub~&#xD;
around its base, in such a wild luxuriance, -are very nice,&#xD;
quite beautiful.&#xD;
The shades of evening are gathering round, and it is&#xD;
full thne to be looking out for comfortable quarters for&#xD;
the night. They had gone but a short distance after&#xD;
leaving the bridge, when they passed, just by t~e road&#xD;
side, a low shanty, of round logs or poles. The little&#xD;
hut was of the rudest order, framed as we said of&#xD;
round logs of pine, and filled between the crevices with&#xD;
mud and straw. The light was admitted by some single&#xD;
panes,. arranged in. a row where a gap had been made&#xD;
in one of the logs, with a chimney of rude sticks, and a&#xD;
door composed of three clapboards fastened together,&#xD;
and suspended on wooden hinges. The roof was kept in&#xD;
place by laying logs or heavy poles crosswise of the&#xD;
rough boards of which it was composed. Nora said&#xD;
she thought it had a far more comfortable aspect than the&#xD;
home ~f her Irish friend, Mahoning. But, the most&#xD;
unique finishing of all was a rough board placed above&#xD;
the door, very much after the order of the sign of a&#xD;
city dry goods store, with the word "Grocery-" -painted&#xD;
conspicuously-on its front, by -a most ingenious artist,&#xD;
with a red-hot end ~f an iron poker. -&#xD;

Will be constrained to pass on, leaving the black sign&#xD;
and its interesting antecedents to pursue their vocation&#xD;
in' undisturbed repose.&#xD;
The whole party were particularly impressed with one&#xD;
fact since they have been traveling in Virginia...... the&#xD;
general prevalence of dissipation and drinking in the&#xD;
slave States. All had noticed, too, the great 'difference&#xD;
in the general tone of 'morals in society, eSpecially with&#xD;
the lower orders and with 'young men. Drinking&#xD;
seemed so very prevalent' in all grades and classes of&#xD;
society. And fighting,' its faithful accompaniment!&#xD;
All agreed that the exchange would n~t be either profit.&#xD;
able or pleasant; did ' not think they would ever have a&#xD;
desire or a wish for a permanent residence in a 'slate&#xD;
State. As Morley says, he is satisfied, far better satis-&#xD;
fled' than he has ever been, With our own institutions and&#xD;
usages, added to our improvements.' They will do to&#xD;
boast of!&#xD;
At the Bridge House, where our party are 'staying for&#xD;
the night, they met with a party' of about the same&#xD;
magnitude of their own en' route for the celebrated&#xD;
Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. Our new party, like our&#xD;
old friends, being only pkasure seekers, soon persuaded&#xD;
the Virginia travelers to' 'alter thefr e~tirse, and seek for&#xD;
nature's wonder~ and curiosities in' another dfr~ction.&#xD;
So it is agreed that the united parties shall set off in&#xD;
the' morning for the wonderrul 'cavern.'&#xD;

Again we will have to beg an apology for another eph&#xD;
sode, for we are aware we have a habit of episoding;&#xD;
but when a new idea strikes us we like to use it, lest it&#xD;
should be lost altogether, but will endeavor te get back&#xD;
to the place of departure.&#xD;
Nora says, "As for rocks, and hills, aiid mountain&#xD;
scenery at large, 1 like it all; there is so much sublim-~&#xD;
ity and, grandeur, so many scenes of picturesque beauty;&#xD;
but the bridge is a solitary wonder of its kind1 we&#xD;
have no larger and smaller natural bridge, none possess2'&#xD;
ing more or less curiosity, but one, standing solitary&#xD;
and alone, on the whole continent, both a wonder and&#xD;
a curiosity. But I too like the change, and think I&#xD;
shall enjoy it very much."&#xD;
Our friends traveled again on the cars, but this time&#xD;
without any incident ~worth relating, until. they found&#xD;
themselves in the neighborhood of the cave.&#xD;
The new found friends made quite an addition to our&#xD;
little party-they too were a bridal party. The bride-&#xD;
groom was a Mr. McDowel, an old 'schoolmate of Mor-&#xD;
ley's in College, and was a most agreeable recog~iition.&#xD;
Of couri~ an interchange of introductions followed?&#xD;
but Nora felt so much embarrassed when she. caught the&#xD;
eye of tLo new acquaintance bent inquiringly on herself,&#xD;
as if he was reading her all over to see if Fred had&#xD;
made a good choice. She was so much embarrassed she&#xD;
feared she had attracted the attention of the company&#xD;
to herseL She was worried with herself and almost pro..&#xD;
yoked with Fred. What did make him tell the secret?&#xD;
She didn't intend to, say one word, not ev~n to Su~ie,&#xD;
until they got:home. flut Susie had guessed it all the&#xD;

very first evening, because she said Fred looked sort of&#xD;
consequential, and seemed so very unspeakably happy;&#xD;
and then Miss Nora herself, somehow, has grown mar-&#xD;
velously well contented from some cause. Susie~ says&#xD;
she knows there is a reason for all this that will be&#xD;
known after a while, when there is another bridal party&#xD;
starting from Uncle Grey~s. But she intends to hold&#xD;
her peace, and we will see what is: what.&#xD;
The excursion into the magnificent palace of nature's&#xD;
own building 'was a scene of exciting iiiterest. And all,&#xD;
particularly the gentlemen of the party, enjoyed it to&#xD;
the life. 'Twas grand beyond conception-.seas, mouu~&#xD;
tains, ~lakes, and rivers were all to he round uniting&#xD;
their varied scenery in that submundane region it was&#xD;
beyond description, language is too barren to make~the'&#xD;
atien~pt. Like Niagara., it is' one of God's mightiest&#xD;
works, before which man 'stands abashed, wondering, in&#xD;
silent awe wondering, that he can, frail child. of the&#xD;
dust as he is, dive into the bowels of the earth, pene.~&#xD;
trate miles and miles, climb mountains, cross rivers, and&#xD;
traverse lakes;. all, too, lying in total darkness, just ~&#xD;
kt~ 'came from the plastic hand of the Mighty Father,~&#xD;
Rim who spt~ke and it stood forth.&#xD;
Nora and Fred did enjoy that ~cav'crn explorations~&#xD;
very much, for they were both (although very different&#xD;
in dipo~itiou in many respects) enthusiastic admirers of&#xD;
i~atur6 in all her varied moods; besides, both possessed&#xD;
minds 'tending strongly to the ideal, 'and an inward&#xD;
sense far mote fastidious than falls to the lot of' the&#xD;
more" worldly minded. With them friendship *as&#xD;
formed rather* on 'similarity of tastes~than on similarity&#xD;
&#xD;
of disposition1 for they were both passionate admirers&#xD;
of either nature or art in 'their very highest moods.&#xD;
They would have made whole-souled 'crusaders, gone to'&#xD;
the T[oly Sepulchre, in their deep enthush~jsm, in the&#xD;
days of CQUr~ de Lion or of Peter the JThrmit, or have&#xD;
stood for the Republic in the days of the ~Xriurnvirate.&#xD;
Just the minds that gave their whole energies to the&#xD;
present occasion, seeing everything through the medium&#xD;
of their peculiar enthusiasm. But, with all this depth&#xD;
of sanguine enthusiasm, Nora possessed a clear~seeing&#xD;
judgment, tempered by a constant, habitual discipline.&#xD;
With a mind ever active, she did not deem her duty&#xD;
performed when her own peculiar wishes were subserved,&#xD;
but believed~ herself called on to labor for the good of&#xD;
others in whatever capacity circumstances ~might seem&#xD;
to point out.&#xD;
flut, in the present excursion, Susie Rayburn judg&#xD;
one particular source of exquisite enjoyment to consist&#xD;
in the peculi~1r circumstance of each lady being under&#xD;
the necessity of depending on a manly arm for support&#xD;
in penetrating into the depths of the mighty cavern,&#xD;
whose myste ious depths the broad glare of the noon~.&#xD;
tide sun can never penetrate with his genial warmth,&#xD;
nor the moo 's paler rays illume with her mild efful..&#xD;
gence wher the~ ~ij~ealing thunders or forked light-&#xD;
nings, heaven s most sublime artillery, are never heard&#xD;
nor seen, and where the echoes of the human voice die&#xD;
away without response. The only sound heard with.. ~&#xD;
in that wonderful cavern is the ever ceaseless hum of&#xD;
roaring waterfalls, of which there are said to be seven&#xD;
already discovered in this greatest of all the Ahziighty's&#xD;

*            CHAPTER X.&#xD;
TH.B RECEPTION PARTY.&#xD;
The gentlemen deemed it the better part of wisdom&#xD;
to precede their return b~ a telegraphic Jispatch, that&#xD;
all things might be in readiness for their reception, the&#xD;
arrangement being we'll nride7rstood' before hand.&#xD;
On the reception of the dispatch ct~rds were issued&#xD;
for a grand~ party, and all the' elite of the little city&#xD;
were' in a fluster of expectancy - bea~is, and bells and&#xD;
mothers of n~arriageable daughters, that had passed the&#xD;
first season of their entrance into' soei~ty, and were&#xD;
verging far i~to the second, without losing their maiden&#xD;
title. As tI~ere were some gentlemen of distinction an~&#xD;
nounced frot~i the neighboring town 4~f 13i-.-., expect.&#xD;
tion was all, tiptoe for 'the important occasion.&#xD;
Our excursion party~ having arrived on the cars, all&#xD;
things were ,in full preparation fQr the anticipated even&#xD;
ning's enjoy4e ~ t, and many a youthful heart beat high&#xD;
with prospect o the' anticipated pleasure.&#xD;
It was tl~ largest, most brilliant party of the season&#xD;
that assemhjled in 'th~e splendidly lighted parlors of Mi~.'&#xD;
Grey's beautiful new 'mansion, just completed, and' built'&#xD;
after the 'most approved, 'aristocratic style iOf the~ reigrv&#xD;
ing order, with its brown 'marble 'front and modern mi-&#xD;
provements. '&#xD;
A flutter of delighted sensation ran through the sis-&#xD;
sembled crowd when the bridal party were anuonneed.&#xD;
The bride came in leaning on the:arm~of thebridesmaid,&#xD;

THE RECEPTION PARTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
preceded by the taller and more stately figures of the&#xD;
groom and groomsman, introducing them alike to stran-&#xD;
gers and acquaintances. The bride's pretty face and&#xD;
graceful figure was set off by a rich dress of the most&#xD;
tasty material of the season, all fluttering in a fleecy&#xD;
cloud ,oft gauzes, and flowers, and ril~bons, her head&#xD;
ornamented by a single wreath of snowy orange flowers;&#xD;
but not a single article of jewelry, excepting a plain&#xD;
ring, worn unobtrusively ow the betrothal finger, and a&#xD;
very slight, chain, from which a small but remarkably&#xD;
neat wateh.was~suSpOnded.&#xD;
The bridesmaid, so entirely different in the whole&#xD;
contour of her face and figure, handsome but not pret-&#xD;
ty, a beauty more of intellect than feature, ~ figure not&#xD;
petit and graceful, but' mere elegant and dignified,&#xD;
dressed with a similarity of taste, but a shade plainer&#xD;
in Kalinost every respect9 Nora Wilmot could not be&#xD;
said to possess any decided talent for dress, eitherr was&#xD;
she one of the slateruly order; she only dressed neatly&#xD;
'from an intuitive sense of propriety,&#xD;
No ,wonder 'a murm~r~ of admiration ran through the&#xD;
crowd of strangers, as well as familiar faees, at tha en~&#xD;
trance of the party, and that the eye of AIf Rayburn&#xD;
should follow his little bride with a proud look of admira.~&#xD;
tion as she glides through the apartiiients, the particular&#xD;
star of th*~evening. And her amiable, kind manner, ~higbt-.&#xD;
ened by a brilliance of wit and a fund of good humor,&#xD;
make her a most agreeable companion to all, old oe&#xD;
young, grave ~r gay.&#xD;
'And Eayburn too, Susie said,, he could do the agree-&#xD;
able to half the company at the same time, and not'&#xD;
&#xD;
neglect his little wife any either. He niways has been a&#xD;
favorite in society, one of the freehand easy sort, with"a&#xD;
pleasant word for all. - The girls all liked hini because&#xD;

appropriated him, in her scheming fancy, as a fixture in&#xD;
her own family, hoping he might be her son~in-law be-&#xD;
fore the season was over, for he had a kind-hearted way&#xD;
of never sending any away with a sorry heart, and with&#xD;
nothing to hope in the fut~ire. But now'that he had&#xD;
surprised and disappointed all, both' gentlemen and La-&#xD;

Miss Wilmot too, the bridesmaid of the' occasion, ig&#xD;

With those who knew her she has ahvays 'been a great&#xD;
favorite, especially in married society; but, in mixed&#xD;
society, she was never very popular.&#xD;
Rayburn says young gentlemen of comnion, ordinary&#xD;
stripe: stand in awe of her; she has too much dignity and&#xD;
intelligence for their~ calibre-they can't appreciate her,&#xD;
But he says Morley' is one of the npper order; one of&#xD;

he never has had much popularity in mixed society.&#xD;
Somehow he never had a faculty of making himself at&#xD;
all agreeable there; he can't talk small talk with any-&#xD;
thing like fluency, nor jump quick when a lady wants&#xD;
something; is sure to be reading the poetry when. he&#xD;
ought to turn over the music book leaves; and, some-&#xD;
times, lets a lady stand several minutes without seem-&#xD;
ing t~ notice her. Common etiquette and gallantry, as&#xD;
the world goes, set on him just like a stolen coat, they&#xD;
don't fit at all. Susie Rayburn says he is too high and&#xD;
lofty tbr these things; but then he has an easy polite-&#xD;
ness of, his own that is very agreeable after all, a defer-&#xD;
ence for the opinions of others, 'and a tender solicitude&#xD;
for others' feelings, that render him after all a. welcome&#xD;

- As was thQ custom in those days, (remember, we are&#xD;
not writing events of the present but of the past,) a&#xD;
waiter come in bearing a tray filled with the choicest&#xD;
wines, and another, following close behind, with water.&#xD;
Of courser as mistress of the evening's entertainment-, it&#xD;
was first presented to the bride; she declined. When it&#xD;
came to the bridesmaid, all-were not a little surprised to&#xD;
see her lift a glass of wine, but instead of raising it to&#xD;
her lips she turned it bottom up in the tray, and then&#xD;
lifting a glass of water to her lips drank it off. This&#xD;
was striking the cause at the right place. The other&#xD;
ladies all followed suit, and not one drop of wine was&#xD;
drank; but - each in turn took a glass of nature's own&#xD;
pure beverage, best suited for delicate stomachs. - The&#xD;
gentlemen would not be behind the ladies even in the&#xD;
cause of temperance; the contagion spread, and before&#xD;
&#xD;
the tray had passed half' down the line of gentlemen it&#xD;
was afloat in the precious beverage, and pure cold wa-&#xD;
ter seemed the rage for that evening at leasA.&#xD;
It had been. said before this, "that actions speak&#xD;
louder than words," but it had been left to the ladies of&#xD;
the growing city of R.-.-.-. too fully verify it. Much&#xD;
had been said on the subject of temperance; several so-&#xD;
cieties had been formed, with pledges prohibiting the&#xD;
alcoholic beverages. Almost every member of society,&#xD;
either male or female, that made any pretensions to re-&#xD;
spectability in the community, had their names enrolled&#xD;
on some~. of the temperance pledges of the different so-&#xD;
cieties. But none had ever tried to strike at the root&#xD;
of the evil. It was all' a mere temporizing business&#xD;
banishing the poor man's drink, but giving countenance&#xD;
to that that was only within reach of the rich;' telling&#xD;
the poor man, A~Jaat had only the means of gratifying&#xD;
his insatiate thirst with a glass of rum or whisky, that&#xD;
he must abstain from indulgence, not alone- for his own&#xD;
benefit and that of his family, but for the good of&#xD;
society likewise; and then patting the' rich man's&#xD;
shoulder, with his well filled decanters and overflowing&#xD;
goblets on his sideboard with richest wines and spark-&#xD;
ling catawba.&#xD;
The doctrine of entire prohibition ~had never seemed&#xD;
so much as to ~have been thought of. And the idea of&#xD;
actions before words of total destruction, and of using&#xD;
'female influence, were all new; but' they were -all em-&#xD;
bodied in that one act, and; to an active, thinking&#xD;
mind, presented grander meanings and significations&#xD;
than the mere act of emptying out that-wine. It was&#xD;

Mr. Morley said, "It had ever been a matter of sur~&#xD;

entirely regardless of the best interests of society; as to&#xD;

"Well," said Mr. IRayburn, "I am in 'favor of blow-&#xD;
ing up the whole concern at once by stopping distill-&#xD;

plan that reason suggests to my mind. Jor just as&#xD;

will be bought, ai~d just as long as they are bought it&#xD;
follows, as a thing of course, that they will be drank.!'&#xD;
"Well," said Mr~. y, "I like that suggestion very&#xD;
well, but I apprehend ~there may be sN~rne difficulty in&#xD;
getting a Legislature to act on such suggestion. "&#xD;
"Oh," said Uayburn, "I am much disappointed in&#xD;
the tone of public sei4iment, if the great mass of the&#xD;
people are not in favor of any action that might 1*&#xD;
called for on the subject of temperance. I believe the&#xD;
people at large, even the 'drinking portion themselves,&#xD;
would rejoice to see the last temptation removed out of&#xD;
their way; for, with a great many, I am led to believe,&#xD;
from their own declarations7 that is their only hope of&#xD;
reforms"&#xD;

that habit has thrown around them, that, with many,&#xD;

lack of moral courage; their inward powers of existence&#xD;

them at every step. We have a truly deplorable state&#xD;

Mr. Morley said, "It is my honest conviction, that if&#xD;
ever the ladies are voters; and temperance should be&#xD;
made a political- test, a very large majority of the' ladies'&#xD;

"Won't We pocket all such compliments as .those senti-'&#xD;

"~ Most certainly," said 'several ladies'; "they are quite&#xD;
consolatory to our feelings."&#xD;

"But I think some of our young gentlemen are em-'&#xD;
bracing some new theories of h~te, or have been *~ttend-&#xD;

pretty speakers, I don't know which," said Mrs. Wood.&#xD;
"I know young gentlemen are very easily converted,&#xD;
when such captivatin~gbistru.ments are used. '~&#xD;
"Oh, yes, but we are not going to enfranchise the&#xD;
ladies so very readily as you might presume; we gentle-&#xD;
men have a good many grave objections. that have got&#xD;
to be removed first," said Judge Wood.~ "We happen&#xD;
to have that business in our own hands, ladies, and don't&#xD;
intend to relinquish our prerogative until we are satisfied&#xD;
that such a change will be a mutual advantage to all&#xD;
parties concerned."&#xD;

if it wou)d not be an intrusion, on the balance of the&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
-   TIlE KNITTiNG PARTY.&#xD;
After Nora had i~qturned from seeing Susie safely&#xD;
started on the cars for her new home in a w~,st~rw Vil-&#xD;
lage, not a hundred miles off, a note was put into her&#xD;
hands by a stranger. Breaking the seal, she read as&#xD;
- follows:&#xD;
DEAR NORA - I hope you will excuse this freedom,&#xD;
J for I do feel in, oh! so much affliction; and have not&#xD;
one kindred heart to which I can turn for sympathy&#xD;
neither father, mother, sister, nor brother; even Aunty,&#xD;
that dear, disiqterested, ,best friend, is gone. I feel&#xD;
~almost alone in the wide world. I have borne all in si-&#xD;
lence until my heart turns with a yearning for sympathy;&#xD;
and I felt that I could confide to your my very dear&#xD;
friend. Oh! Nora, how can I tell you all! My noble&#xD;
husband, that was so good and kind, has been deluded&#xD;
from his integrity, led by wicked associates to taste the&#xD;
wine when it was'red, until he seems completely infatu-&#xD;
ated, to have forgotten every moral obligation, even&#xD;
the holy obligations and duties he owes to the sweet&#xD;
baies God has given us, that used to be his pride and&#xD;
delight. And last night, oh! horror of horrors! he&#xD;
came home at a very late hour, aDd took the little inno-&#xD;
cents (that' have always been 'nursed so tenderly, for&#xD;
Charley used to be so alarmed if the wind only was suf-&#xD;
fered to blow on them too rudely,) and thrust them out&#xD;
into the pitiless storm, saying, he wanted then'i to grow&#xD;
&#xD;
a little more hardy; they couldn't 4ways be kept so del-&#xD;
icately; he wanted to str&amp;amp;iigthen their constitutions, or&#xD;
they would never be of any account. For myself I&#xD;
would have suffered anything rather than have exposed&#xD;
myself to the pitying eye of strangers......buv thy- babes!&#xD;
I felt I could bear all for them, and so craved a shelter&#xD;
from the nearest'neighbor; and good Samaritans they&#xD;
truly were to me and mine They tookusin, oh! so&#xD;
kindly, giving us the best shelter their slender means&#xD;
afforded, and were so much interested for' the children.&#xD;
They, will ever have my warmest gratitude. FLow can&#xD;
I bear so much? My own dear -husband, the father of&#xD;
my babes, the chosen one in life's early 'morn7 how can 'I&#xD;
see him destroying himself, his credit, his reputation,&#xD;
his health, his prospects for time and for eternity'! Is&#xD;
there no remedy, no hope? Oh! if there only -was no&#xD;
more drink, no place where men 'could procure the&#xD;
means of self-destruction, no more temp~ationl Must&#xD;
it ever be thus, just because men will, only for the mere&#xD;
sake of gain, allure, and tempt, and ensnare ihe victims&#xD;
of intemperance? If Charley only would listen to me&#xD;
as once he delighted to! But-now, oh! I dare not ~o&#xD;
much as make the attempt, for he will not listen, will not&#xD;
heed any warning or any entreaty; will- not even listen&#xD;
to the voice of affection. But I will ~niy say in. con-&#xD;
clusion, do, trny dearest friend, come to me; perhaps&#xD;
you can suggest something or some way. You know a&#xD;
droWning man will catc1~ 'at straws. Bat - do, my dear,&#xD;
come, I want so much to see you.&#xD;
&#xD;
Your friend,&#xD;

&#xD;
Little, Mary Price judged aright ~hen she mad~&#xD;
choice of Nova Wilmot~.as one to whom she could iin~&#xD;
burthen all her troubled heart; for Nora never could&#xD;
find a place in her W~art t~ harbor one. feeling in to&#xD;
turn. a deaf ear to the appeal of a wounded heart. Her&#xD;
nature was.too sympathetic, and, she had learned to feel&#xD;
another's woe. She was soon on her way to Mary Price's&#xD;
humble dwelling. She found Mary so very glad to see&#xD;
Poor Mary! it was a hard lesson ~he was learning;&#xD;
~inaIl wonder if she did-.erave sympathy 'of some friendly&#xD;
aid~ Child of prosperity, as she had always been, and&#xD;
reared so tenderly- although left an orphan at a very&#xD;
tender age-~ the l&amp;amp;asV of .~. quite. numerous family which&#xD;
had heen swept offin. one short-week by that fearful&#xD;
scourge, the chQlera~, that left desolate so ~nany heartJa~&#xD;
stones, sparing neither~age, nor sex, nor, station; sweep-&#xD;
ing alike the man of hoary years, tottering on the brink&#xD;
of the grave, whose pilgrimage was well nigh ended;&#xD;
the son, the -prop on which age was leaning, now just&#xD;
ripening into full maturity; and the. tender babe, prat-&#xD;
tling all ~day long at its mother's side, shedding light&#xD;
and gladness, as none but. prattling infancy can. .When&#xD;
all ~was~ over, and there were none ,left but this tender&#xD;
bud in its helplessuess~ a rich aunt came from a distant&#xD;
part ~f the State, and took the orphaned one to the&#xD;
shelter~of her home; and, ~s her own children had all&#xD;
been taken aw~y in ,early infancy, this little dependent&#xD;
one brought back the sunlight to that darkened home.&#xD;
And, as Mary said, well did those childless parent~ re-&#xD;
pay. all h~r, ,gentle 'afYection When her own mother&#xD;
&#xD;
had died, Mary' was not old enough to appreciate her&#xD;
loss; and her good amity bad so well supplied het1&#xD;
place, she never had known a difference. flv~ery thing&#xD;
that kindness and affection, aided by wealtlvand influ-&#xD;
ence, could do, to traiii her. youthful. mindj was done..-..&#xD;
and Mary loved those doting foster~.parents:with all a&#xD;
daughter's guileless affection..,: But they, too,&#xD;
"'flad gone from the earth,&#xD;
And were nuder th~ sod ;"&#xD;
and little Mary Sutton was left a second time an orpha;&#xD;
before she, had, numbered sixteen summers; and,, a~~cept~&#xD;
ing the kind invitation of a distant relative, in the city&#xD;
~f R , found a home un4er his roof-.....aad in the&#xD;
same spirit that it was given, it had been accepted. -&#xD;
When Mary first caine-a stranger tQ h~errkew? honie.....~&#xD;
and was introduced as a member of society, she was the&#xD;
admired of all admirers. - When .Qharley Pric~ won. her&#xD;
young heart~ offered his hand, and was accepted, her&#xD;
friends thought, as the phrase goes on such occasions,&#xD;
pretty Mary Sutton would do so well I&#xD;
Charley had always been considered a. model young&#xD;
man; but rumor had said; the last year previous to.bi8&#xD;
marriage, that he had,, occasionally, indulge4 in ~ social&#xD;
glass with a great many other young - gentlemen, but. it&#xD;
was all kept very quiet, and there seeme&amp;amp; bu~ little&#xD;
thought of it any way. Those who did- knew it to be&#xD;
a certainty, were generally those -~lio we~eguiit~-of tIi~&#xD;
same improprieties, and were; of course, inter~ste4 i~i&#xD;
saying nothing aboi~t~ ~&#xD;
And so Mary, in, ~her y~th a~d innocence, ~theu~&#xD;

she was giving lieT young affections to one .who was f~Or-&#xD;
section's self. But we will have to take the world just&#xD;
as. we find it, and try t4~ reform it as best we can.&#xD;
There w~asa~ long conference that morning over the&#xD;
ways and means~ best calculated to redress this mighty&#xD;
wrong. ~' Innumerable plans ~were suggested, and then&#xD;
dropped, as insufficient for the emergency.&#xD;
Mary said-but, perhaps, we may be telling family&#xD;
secrets-that there was one house that she thought was&#xD;
the only place Charley visited; and it was one of the&#xD;
genteel' tippling saloons, where the proprietor 'kept only&#xD;
the best order of drinks for genteel customers, under the&#xD;
guise of oysters, ice cream, cream nectar, &amp;amp;c. She had&#xD;
uevei~ known Oharley go any place else, and she knew&#xD;
the proprietor had been' an old acquaintance of Char-&#xD;
ley's in boyhood~ She thought~ they were room-mates&#xD;
in. College, and that this man had a great influence over&#xD;
him. Mary more than half blanied him for Charley's&#xD;
downfall; and there were several others visiting the&#xD;
same place~ that were going just as lie was, who had a&#xD;
very strong influence 'ovet him, too. She thought if&#xD;
that one establishmentt Was only out of the way, Charley&#xD;
might be easily induced to reform. But the proprietor&#xD;
stood like lMkrdecai at the king's gate; he was always&#xD;
layiii.g traps fbr' him. When they had to leave their&#xD;
beautiful home, Mary said she left it cheerfully, because&#xD;
it ~w~ild be taking him into another part of the city,&#xD;
out 4~f the immediate influence of this man sand his&#xD;
establishment ;~ und 'she could plainly see the beneficial&#xD;
results on her husband: he seemed "to be fast'ref&amp;amp;rming,&#xD;
until -Vhis s&amp;amp;m ~ian2had' taken it upon himself toA help&#xD;

THE 1~IITTING PAUTY.           '141&#xD;

directly by his establiahment every time he came home;&#xD;
and it was soon evident on his~ manner. "&#xD;
Nora said she thought they could n~ianage his ~a~e h~&#xD;
getting' up a grand knitting party. She told Mary to&#xD;
be sure to have &amp;amp; nice job of knitting wQrk, ull ready for&#xD;
use, against the next Thursday, aud to have all4bing~&#xD;
in readiness to spend the day from home. Anti if Mr&#xD;
Tradewelt would not consent to' a proposition to abandon&#xD;
his traffic, they would get up a'knitting party, and un~ke&#xD;
his saloon the theatre of their operations, and they&#xD;
would knit~ on from day to day~ .iintil they would make&#xD;
him glad to capitulate.&#xD;
On her way home; Nora called on several ladies-...&#xD;
some twelve or fifteen.- that' she knew possessed char-&#xD;
acter and' standing in Society, and' disclosed her Inten-&#xD;
tions. Most of the ladies were vi~ry n~iuch interested in&#xD;
Mrs. Price's story, 'and offered but slight objections to&#xD;
the very novel mode of procedure submitted for their&#xD;
consideration. It was an original idea to all; but they&#xD;
agreed to trust all to Sora, and if they got into 'any&#xD;
difficulty, she 'must stand responsible for the conse-&#xD;
quences. They were willing to give their-time and ser~&#xD;
vices to any adventure that seemed to offer any phiusi~&#xD;
ble grounds of' aid to a reformation tha~t all savr Abe&#xD;
growing necessity far.&#xD;
First, they drew up a petition, couched. in the most'&#xD;
respectful 'terms, and signed by about forty ladie&amp;amp; &amp;amp;&#xD;
known inthiezice,' petitioning~ in the ~deepe~t ~in~c~ty;'&#xD;

with considerable au~4ety tkkni~w.the result of 1~hia &amp;amp;st.&#xD;
effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ansvi~r came Within: the time designated; written&#xD;
in very proper, concise order, entirely respectful as' any&#xD;
set 'of' ladiescould possibly desire; but flatly refusing,&#xD;
in very positive terms, to accede to any part of the&#xD;
petition. For, as Mr. Tradewell said, he~ had;not, iii&#xD;
any one case, been proven to have transcended the limits&#xD;
of thelaws of his State; for the matter' had been well&#xD;
tried, repeatedly,~ and so loiig~ as he could be a laiv..&#xD;
abiding max4 he thinks he 'would be satisfied.&#xD;
"Yes, ladies, with all deference, I must say, 'that, the&#xD;
laws of my State give me full and entire liberty to pur~&#xD;
sue my avocation with entire impunity, and IL ca.n see xio&#xD;
reason why my business need be considered so very great&#xD;
a nuisance. If 'men do 'not "govern their appetites, it is&#xD;
their own'fault~ and not mine; I 'ani not accatnltable&#xD;
for 'my customers, and do not wish to be so considered.&#xD;
I never 'have, ladies, been so much' as selfapp~inted&#xD;
guardian for this community. When I get an appoint.&#xD;
ment to that effect, I shall be pleased to 1~t you know&#xD;
it; and whenever that event transpires, you may send&#xD;
in your petitlons, and they shall be attended to in all&#xD;
good faith. But 'nuder existing regulations, r wish "it&#xD;
distinctly understood, that I expect to enjoy the very&#xD;
reasonable privilege of attending to my own busiae~s&#xD;
without fear or fayor, with all becoming deference t&amp;amp; the&#xD;
fair petitioners.&#xD;

ix~offensive ladies, armed with. knitting-needles as weap.&#xD;
ons of warfare. -&#xD;
There was a deal of arranging, and talking, and eon-&#xD;
Lerring together, that nee&amp;amp; not he told anything about.&#xD;
Neither do we dee~n it essential -to our present purpose,&#xD;
to - say whether Nora Wihuot said anything about the&#xD;
propriety of the knitting party to Fred ~Morley,. or not.&#xD;
Bu1~ we are sure of one thing: we know Mr. Morley is&#xD;
about the most thorough temperance man in town; and&#xD;
we prophesy that Uncle Grey will, some day, be just- as&#xD;
enthusiastic as he is. J~ut he isn't now, by-any means6&#xD;
He says it is all well enough. Thinks it would ~be a&#xD;
grand thing if drinking- could all be ~lone away with,&#xD;
because- it is almost abominable practice; is surprised&#xD;
that any -man, hearing three straws. for h~s reputation, or&#xD;
a fig f6r his family, ~anAndulge in so ruinous a practice&#xD;
-&amp;amp; ~r~ctice calculated in its tendency- t~ destroy every&#xD;
spark of manhood -and independence, and every moral&#xD;
principle aman may possess; ruinous alike to property&#xD;
and prospects. - -&#xD;
But -many another nan% possessing just as latitudina-&#xD;
~iai~ principles as Mr. Grey, hava been converted~.&#xD;
sometimes, too, without his terrible. ha~ti~al of arnie-&#xD;
Iu the matter of the knitting party, Mr. Grey thought&#xD;
very lightly of such a motion. Thinks the 1~dies had&#xD;
bettor stay at h&amp;amp;me, and leave such business t~the gen-&#xD;
tlemen's care. Is willing himself to talk to Mr. Trade-&#xD;
~eU 4hout the impropriety of his course with regard to&#xD;

be suspected of being in 4ie - employ of the ladies~ be-&#xD;
longing~ to their- committee~\or something else .-~. thinks&#xD;
the whole matter~ had better rest a few weeks.&#xD;
Bnt, notwithstanding Mr.~Grey's opinion~ to the con-&#xD;
trary, Thursday morning came; and all things being s~s&#xD;
thematically understood previously, our friend Tradewdll&#xD;
was n~t a little surprised with the unceremonious en-&#xD;
trance af several bevies of ladies almost simultaneously&#xD;
amounting in all to some twelve or fifteen6 - - It was a&#xD;
little surprising that so many ladies should be attracted&#xD;
with iv sudden desire to visit Mr. Tradewell's saloon the&#xD;
game morning-! And, then, each company was no~ less&#xD;
pleaded than surprised with meeting the balance of the&#xD;
company- seemingly, there was no concert of action,&#xD;
but they -were all there ! - - But not one lady was present&#xD;
whose name had been on the petition. -&#xD;
It was all curious enough I So thought Mr. Amos&#xD;
Tradewell. That dignitary stepped briskly behind the&#xD;
coui~ter; with a low bow, and a ~bland smile that -wag&#xD;
only on one side of his face, (for some - how he did n~&#xD;
f~e1 more than half at ease,) he aske&amp;amp; the ladies, as-each&#xD;
company eame in~ if he could ~wait- on them, with some-&#xD;
thing in his line, this morning - would be happy~ t~&#xD;
accommodate them -.-~ had just received a fine supply~ of&#xD;
southern fruit: oranges, ~of -the first quality; lemons,&#xD;
that he could reconunend. ; prunes, just in order for&#xD;
.culiuarypurposes; pine apples;khe' first of the season&#xD;
and tamarinds, of a sup*~rior quality~ together~ witk- a&#xD;
fine variety of canned - fruits-- would be very ~glad to&#xD;
furnish tall with fruits-~ for the season'~-us&amp;amp; on very low&#xD;
terms. But the ladies did~ not -seem. at all dispos~4 to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7669-00000088"/>&#xD;
purchase; and our dapper~ little salesman, after exhaust~&#xD;
ing his vocabulary of praises on his merchandise, was&#xD;
completely Douplussed to' know what construction to&#xD;
put. on the strange conduct of his visitors: . for it was&#xD;
evident- enQugh, that' there was something ~ in the wind&#xD;
tli~4 our salooi~ man- did n't quite understand, and co~ld&#xD;
not fathom,. ~. I&#xD;
Illis surprise was very considerably increased when&#xD;
each visitor very deliberately~ seated herself, and thrust..&#xD;
lug a fair hand down -into a capacious, side.pocket, that&#xD;
Mr. Tradewell contends to this- day. was prepared~ espe-&#xD;
cially for '-thai occasion, and drew- forth 'a-huge ~balL of&#xD;
yarn, with a' pair of shining knitters stuck 'demurely&#xD;
into it, and proceeded just as familiarly to -arrange her&#xD;
business as if she were seated. in her own parlor or&#xD;
quiet little snuggery Soon' each pair of busy fingers&#xD;
were. jingling the shining~ needles with as much al~rt~&#xD;
ness as if knitting had been th~ only business in life&#xD;
worth any lady's attention; all the while accompanying&#xD;
her labor with her tongi~e.-&#xD;
All the most- important; business matters of the day&#xD;
were freely discussed, at full length, 'by the cheerful little&#xD;
company, who seemed ouly- intent .~i their knitting&#xD;
work, as they would still be. saying, and spending' a so~&#xD;
cial day ;' seeming entirely unconscious that they wei'e in~&#xD;
trading in any. way or on any' petsoLn's privileges, ~r that&#xD;
Mr.. 4mos- Tr~dewelI's saloon wasn't, a very -proper&#xD;
place fo~ any 4&amp;amp;zen 'ladje~ to'spend a very social ilay.&#xD;
When any subject was discussed oa which the ladies&#xD;
found themselve at issue,- or that they we~ra not entirely&#xD;
- conversable on, they turned to our 'friend Amos, as nat&#xD;
&#xD;
rally as if. that little personage was one of their oWn&#xD;
company~ or was the charming personage they had&#xD;
- come expressly to V1$ltb Thit, to a close observer, thero&#xD;
was a sly twinkle of apparent mischief, just discernible&#xD;
ui the corner of the eye of each. When any of the custom~&#xD;
ers ~f Mr. Tradewell'~ saloon made their. appearance a;t&#xD;
the door of the establishment,, they would look in so&#xD;
inquiringly, as much as to say; "What does all this&#xD;
mean? What's up now? We can't just understand&#xD;
all this. This matter certainly will admit~.of some ex~&#xD;
pl~nation, if we can judge aright2'    -      -&#xD;
But the ladies only laughed, and talked,. and plied&#xD;
thefr busy fingers, without -even seeing anything unusual&#xD;
in the present state of affairs.&#xD;
it proved a long day to Mr. Amos, that jlrst day tvf&#xD;
his lady .vjsit~ He. walkedthe floor, 1~oked out of the'&#xD;

When the- noon4ide meal eame on ~ur visitors went&#xD;
out, three or four' at a time.~ would be gone but a short&#xD;
time, and' then come in, and itnother company would go&#xD;
out. So they-were not all absent at any 'one time.&#xD;
When evening came they knitted on until almost time&#xD;
for candles, and~ then' dispersed in the very best of&#xD;
spirits. When the last fair form-had disappeared i~ound&#xD;
the corner, 'Amos. -Tradewell felt such a relief as he had&#xD;
not experienced for many days, and was heard to' ejacu-&#xD;
late something that might -be offensive to' pious ears.&#xD;
But we won't condemn him, for he has been tried in a&#xD;
very vulnerable point to-day. It has been well said, if&#xD;
you want to' know all there is in a man, try him through&#xD;
,,the medium of his purse; if he stands that ordeal, then&#xD;
trusthim.&#xD;
The retreating footsteps had scarce died away, until&#xD;
the old customers were' 'fast assembling to know what&#xD;
ILII this meant. But Mr.. Tradewell was 'as' much at a&#xD;
loss'~aa his customers were to determine what it 'might&#xD;
all mean.. 'The ladies had given no intimation, either&#xD;
of their object or of Their future intentions. Bait he&#xD;
was evidently greatly rejoiced' to ~ee the last one leave,&#xD;
and inwardly hoped, when next they shall take a fancy&#xD;
to have another knitting bee, they 'would -honor~ some&#xD;
other establishment- with their presence, and not make&#xD;
his saloon~ their theatre ofoperations. lie wasn't at nil&#xD;
flattered by any such distinctions, and somehow he had&#xD;
many misgivings of what the future was going to bring&#xD;
forth; felt afraid there was~something brewing under all&#xD;
this that'perhaps 'after al'iwon't work much goQd to' his&#xD;
daTling business. 'But time will reveal what is what.&#xD;
&#xD;
Friday morning came,~an&amp;amp; as Mr. Amos Tradewell&#xD;
was surrounded by some dozen customers, wiping their&#xD;
lips. ~nd discussing~ in an animated strain, the very uii-&#xD;
usual transactions of the previous, day, they were all&#xD;
thrown into Lhe direst confusion, by the appearance of&#xD;
the same number of ladies as the, previous day's com-&#xD;
pany, only there were some missing of the former coni,&#xD;
pany, but their places were supplied by new faces, mak.~&#xD;
ingNup the same number.&#xD;
Again Mr. Tradewell was behind the counter, wishing&#xD;
to know if the ladies wouldn't buy something, bent on&#xD;
making them believe themselves customers. But they&#xD;
"don~t wish to buy any thing in that line, this morning."&#xD;
As before, each visitor seated herself v-ery eomfoit-&#xD;
ably, drew forth the same. job of knitting work~ and was&#xD;
soon busy, plying the same shining needles with her&#xD;
wanted industry. They were soon all busily engaged,&#xD;
comparing the former day's labor, to see whi&amp;amp;h had aow&#xD;
complished the greatest amount of work. It was as~&#xD;
tonishiig to 9ee how those stockings~. had grown in so&#xD;
short a time. HOW those nimble fingers did draw out&#xD;
the long stretches of yarn, from out the curious pockets&#xD;
where the balls lay, at the very bottom, deep down, as&#xD;
if they had alway~ lain there.&#xD;
flow very cheery the ladies are! All The new~cQmers&#xD;
have to be enlightened with the fact that the others~ ha4&#xD;
really beeu there the day before, together with Mrs.&#xD;
,and Mrs. '-, and Mrs. somebody else~ And&#xD;
then all the events of .the day's particular enjoyment had&#xD;
to he carefully narrate4l. What each ~ne said and did,&#xD;

]~1ach one appeared to be just where she wished to be,&#xD;

before he had declared it would only be a. very light&#xD;
task to stand~behixid that counter and watch'the ladies&#xD;

through, that every one of these ladies is wide awake,&#xD;
and duly sober at that.&#xD;
It is Saturday evening now. And every lady has&#xD;
knitted to the' middle of her 'needle, in the right place,&#xD;
placed the ends of the needles in the hail, and 'carefully&#xD;
deposited 'the~ knitting work in the side pocket for future&#xD;
use, drawn her hood c~refuliy 'over herface, and ~aIl gone&#xD;
out, just as quietly as they came in this morning.&#xD;
,Friend Amos is in atran8port of rage. His patience&#xD;
is- all gone, and his feelings all outraged. It is worse&#xD;
than an attack of delirium tremensfar worse than even&#xD;
being chased by the "man with the poker." For he&#xD;
lies tried both - if he never was known to be drunk.&#xD;
He has determined that he positively will not endure&#xD;
these things another hour. They are beyond endurance.&#xD;
Flesh and~blood cannot bear it. Why, he hasn't made&#xD;
three dollars the last three days. It's worse than per-&#xD;
fect robbery! Stealing away the means of supporting&#xD;
his family! JFor their ~akes,~ he won't submit. Won't&#xD;
you, friend Tradewell?&#xD;
If they would only conw 'and threaten to burn down&#xD;
hi~ establishment, or' with hatchet in hand make an&#xD;
attack on his~ bottles, 'and 'kegs, and barrels, he could&#xD;
make some show of resistance'; or if they ,would&#xD;
open a parley, 'or argument, or even abuse, he could&#xD;
meet 'them on their own. ground. But to come so os&#xD;
derly, so very politely and good naturedly, as if it were&#xD;
altogether in keeping with propriety, as if that were&#xD;
oidy a'ohos~u~res'ortto attend to their knitting work in?&#xD;
Why, bocensarned if lie doesn't hate the very sigl~t of.&#xD;
a pair of knitting~needles, and, as for a ball of yarn,&#xD;
&#xD;
with its' globe-like proportions, blast his eyes if he&#xD;
doesn't wish he had every inch of yarn 'in the land, it&#xD;
would Jo him good to 'see it all in ar blaze. ~He hates&#xD;
the very 'rattle of the needles,'-with their quiet click;&#xD;
click, just as he has had to listen to" about twelve set,&#xD;
all going at the same time. Oh, it is the hatefulest&#xD;
sound he ever yet listOned to'! Thunder is nothing' to&#xD;
it! Who wouldn't rather ~be burned out than knit" out?&#xD;
Mr. Tradewell really thinks he 'would.&#xD;
But' to-morrow is the Sabbath, and they can't come&#xD;
then. That's some comfort. Isn't it a great blessing&#xD;
to have one day out of seven to rest? Amos finds it&#xD;
so, for he is a church-going man,' and his good wife is a&#xD;
church member,' and he believes in attending church;&#xD;
always does go' on~ the Sabbath; thinks it a 'duty he&#xD;
owes to society, to pay attention to these' things to&#xD;
pay some respect to the Sabbath, and to give liberally&#xD;
for the support of 'genteel 'places for 'public worship.&#xD;
But time never stands, but is ever 'dropping out mo.~&#xD;
mont after moment into the great ocean of' Eternity.&#xD;
And now Monday morning has come," and with' it has&#xD;
come the indefatigable members of the knitting circle,&#xD;
bright rand early, as if fully bent on getting- a fine day's&#xD;
work done. This time they didn't even~ get an invita-&#xD;
tion to buy any thing. Mr. Tradewell was very~stiff&#xD;
and surly, scarcely condescending to notice their 'en-&#xD;
trance. But the 'ladies came just as before, knitting and&#xD;
all, each one with a new recruit of yarn, prepared for a&#xD;
regular siege. So~ there could" be no mistaking the in-&#xD;
tentions of ~the party. And Mr. Amos~ consulted some&#xD;
of his best friend's, as tQ whether it Would be best t~&#xD;

make overtures through the medium. of the ladies' hns~&#xD;
bands, or to mal~e propositions to the~ ladies themselves,&#xD;
for he .was altogether satisfied that they came as a com-&#xD;
mittee to torture him. itito some terms, but knew not&#xD;
what those terms would be.. But' he felt satisfied, from&#xD;
the patience and sagacity with which they commenced&#xD;
theix~ operations, that he liadn't~ much to. expect, and by&#xD;
this- -time ho. begins, to feel very much as if he was in'&#xD;
the hands of the ex~emy, and would have to submit to&#xD;
su~h terms. as they may see fit' to subject him to.&#xD;
OnifriendAmos thought, as many far more valiant&#xD;
persons h~ye-, thought before,- that discretion was the&#xD;
better p~t' of valor. So, biting his lips with rage, but&#xD;
pu4ing, on, ~a- I~land smile 'outside, he- asked the ladies,&#xD;
with a-gi~aeious bow, if they had. any thing particularin&#xD;
view, in visiting his saloon thus ,day after~day. They&#xD;
need not betold, for they a~e all ladies of intelligence,&#xD;
that such things are out ~of the common ~ourso ,Qf so-&#xD;
ciety. fl:e is led to believe there is some explanation,&#xD;
and wishes to know it, if it will not be considered an&#xD;
intrusive question.&#xD;
~he ladies could scarcely express how very glad&#xD;
they were of an -opportunity, to bring their protraQted&#xD;
visit to a close. So they deputed Mrs4 Judge Wood to&#xD;
act as speaker 911 the occasb~n.&#xD;
The lady speaker said they had some friends in whom&#xD;
they ,felt a deep interest, that -were- known to have pro-.&#xD;
cured the means of ,intoxication at jiis establishment, for&#xD;
many months, nay, for~years past. They were destroy-&#xD;
ing themselves.~and-. distressing 'their families; breaking&#xD;
th~ hearts ~of their vvivev$ and beggaring tLeir children.&#xD;
'.4'&#xD;
&#xD;

him, in the most respectful terms, to cease ~the r~1iuou$&#xD;
practice of vending intoxicating~. drinks as a beverage;&#xD;
to which 'he- had see~i f1~ to rep1y,'that~ lie wished the&#xD;
privilege of-attending to-his own btsiness~ Soin visw&#xD;
of this fact, and the knowledge they. have of their&#xD;
friends' weakness, they have thought best to come in&#xD;
person, a few at a time, and keep. *t watch over their&#xD;
own friends,' that they may not be subjected to so many&#xD;
temptations. - The remarks continued.:&#xD;
"We are not here, sir) for the purpose of izifriuging&#xD;
upon any person's privileges, or even- intruding upon&#xD;
their tinfe. We only wish to guard. our own. friends&#xD;
from danger, hind hive made preparations to ke~p .a&#xD;
committee constantly on hand, for that sole purpose.&#xD;
As we have a* large number of ladies interested in the&#xD;
znatter~ it can be accomplished without any inconvenience&#xD;
whatever. But, sir, we intend to keep entirely within&#xD;
the requirements of tha law, and are fully posted .just&#xD;
how far we dare go,. without transcendi!lg the limits of&#xD;
the law."&#xD;
If Mr. Traciewell would consent to entirely abandon&#xD;
the traffic, and withdraw temptation frQm their friends,&#xD;
never again sell one drop of an intoxicating bever~tge,&#xD;
and sign .a pledge to that effect, they will withdraw&#xD;
thefr committee.&#xD;
"But, ladies," and the small grey eyes twitched and&#xD;
danced in their socket, and the thin lips Were eo~-&#xD;
pressed with a nervous mOtion, and .the. hands, were&#xD;
thrust' into ~he pockets very quick and jerked out again&#xD;

TH.~, PETITION~&#xD;
Mr~s. R~yburn (our little $usie,, you know, as was)&#xD;
had gone with her husband - t~ a distant part of the&#xD;
State, and left the scene~ of childhood's home to make&#xD;
a name and place among a stranger people, that were&#xD;
all unknown to her antecedents. Small wonder was it&#xD;
then, almost childish as she was, if she did turn with an&#xD;
almost childish idolatry to her noble husband, looking&#xD;
to him for all -father, mother, companion, and friend.&#xD;
For what interest can she feel in those whose faces she&#xD;
has looked upon but once or twice at most, and then&#xD;
only a formal call, or a return in the same spirits? Oh!&#xD;
it is so very different from unburthening every thought&#xD;
to ma, or asking advice of pa, or trusting brother Mark&#xD;
with what ~sEe didn't tell to anybody else, or running to&#xD;
Cousin Nora's room half a dozen times a day to say some-&#xD;
thing she had altogether forgotten to sa~ ~when she was&#xD;
there before, or going to make a short formal call on&#xD;
some one that had been a classmate at school, and the&#xD;
tried friend in childhood's freest hours, and protracting&#xD;
the time, jtist because she enjoyed it, to a day's visit.&#xD;
No formality, no restraint, in those days.&#xD;
"Then the innocent laugh, without any control,&#xD;
Save the sweet one of graeefuLness, rings from the soul."&#xD;
Susie scarce knew the import of such a m as for-&#xD;
inality. Why should she? She had been orn, a~d&#xD;
-  -                              -~  -&#xD;
&#xD;
reared, and educated, just there; evary~ spot w~is fami-&#xD;
liar as household words-the paternal mansion, the&#xD;
schoobroom, th~ college, all in hailing distance. If&#xD;
did leave home for a few days, when she came back&#xD;
every spQt~ so familiar, to childhood's home, must, b~&#xD;
visited as some old cherished friend,&#xD;
But here, in her ~iew~ home, every object is strange,&#xD;
every conutenance new. Sh~ has no landn~iarks to&#xD;
fasten affection's link upon, not ~one familiar streett, or&#xD;
tree, or line, 'or stone, not one talisman for memory's&#xD;
signet. fl~ow she does turn within her owii heart and&#xD;
busy memory's cell, conjuriiig images of past renieni~&#xD;
brance, endowing them with an impertanee not teal.&#xD;
But still Susie's hopeful nature conferred images of&#xD;
bliss, and she was gay as a butterfly, dancing in the gay&#xD;
sunshine of her own unsophisticated nature; for she&#xD;
has her heart's chosen one,. and she says, in her young&#xD;
innocence, she promised, voluntarily, to leave all and&#xD;
follow him, and she is happy in th~ promise. What a&#xD;
child-woman Susie is! and, oh I how she did build ~as-&#xD;
ties in these' days, whose firmest foundation~ are only&#xD;
gossamer.-~castiIes of hope, whose fairest outlines i~ere&#xD;
doomed to be marred by iAherhands.&#xD;
AIf ~Rayburn has left ~the place of his studies and&#xD;
gone to another section of the stb~te, where, as he s&amp;amp;ys~&#xD;
it is comparatively new, &amp;amp;nd he can grow -up with its&#xD;
growth-where he thlnk~ he cain aspire to0om~ polit-&#xD;
iced eminence; for he baa an~ inordinate desire to enter&#xD;
the political arena, and to make a figure ~in the w~rld&#xD;
yet. H~ no notion of living in the world without&#xD;
leaving a ibark behind~~ when he'is gone; not he, and&#xD;

About this time Cousin Nora xecelved a long letter&#xD;

She knew her deep, enthusia~tie nature, her ardent af~&#xD;
fection, and warm sympathies, would be but ill at ease&#xD;
in the chilling atmosphere o~tlie cold formalities of&#xD;
conventional, life. Although she had been brought up&#xD;
in a highly polished society, where the rules of etiquette&#xD;
were observed to a very considerable extent, Susie had&#xD;
felt none of its restraints. Surrounded, as she had&#xD;
been, by kindred sympathies, and the friends of earliest&#xD;
childhood, with whom she had grown to womanhood,&#xD;
her gay, joyous nature, had made her a petted favorite&#xD;
in society.&#xD;

~with only a woman's true devotion,&#xD;

better order of drinks were kept, and drank by, as they&#xD;
fancied, the best class of drinkers - none of the~' scum&#xD;

that might be attached to the respiration, and then w~ut&#xD;

they generally urged as an objection that~ they didn't&#xD;
want to sign away their liberties, as Mr. Drake, an as-&#xD;
pirant to office in the, opposing party, said. For his&#xD;
part, he always expected to stand, firmly planted, on&#xD;
the broad platform of civil liberty.&#xD;

a Mrs. 'Sloan, one of the soliciting committee."&#xD;
"Why, madam, the liberty to do good or evil, just&#xD;
as my own conscience may happen to suggest. ~Neither&#xD;
do I believe that any part of a 'community have a right&#xD;
to say, even by legislation, what I shall eat or drink, or&#xD;
even wha1~ I shall not eat or drinks'&#xD;
"But, Mr. Drake, would you not rather be restrained&#xD;
from doing evil than be tempted to its commission?"&#xD;
"I would rather have no influence ""exerted either&#xD;
way, 'but be left perfectly free to' choose my own course,&#xD;
and then if I. do a good act I merit'sc~xne credit for the&#xD;
action; but if there is no temptation to evil, where&#xD;
would be the virtue of being '~good? I believe in the&#xD;

"IBut 'do you not think any community have a right&#xD;
to pass laws, through their delegated law-makers, to&#xD;

"Most assuredly I do, and believe it ought tq~be done&#xD;
in many instances; but,, at the same time, am not pre-&#xD;

fee and souchong, or young hyson. It's putting too&#xD;
much power into the hands of a few to oppress the mass&#xD;
of community, madam."&#xD;
"But, sir, don't you think that is only a kind of vague&#xD;
ideal of liberty, when the destroyer, intemperance, is as&#xD;
a sword among us, destroying our dearest and best?&#xD;
Can you, sir, as a member of society- as a father of a&#xD;

the rumseller as he would a poisonous viper, and his&#xD;
establishment as a sink of iniquity, a place of disgra~~e;&#xD;
and the whole thing will blow out for want of custom-&#xD;
ers .-for want of encouragement?'&#xD;
"I shall have no fears, madam, but that when we once&#xD;
train the rising generaffon with such thorough temper-&#xD;

ance principles, the ruinseller will have to seek some&#xD;
other outlet for his. time and talent; be~~ause his trade&#xD;
will cease to be a paying business."&#xD;
"Now, that's what I call laying a sure foundation-&#xD;
make our sons patterns of sobriety, order and virtue,&#xD;
and send theni out into the world fortified by correct&#xD;
principles; and then you need have no fears for the in-&#xD;
fluence of the rumseller, or any. other evil doer."&#xD;
"Why, madam, if every rumshop in the land were&#xD;
closed, there would still he evil doers enough, within the&#xD;
pale of society, to startle any parent with the thought&#xD;
of their children's exposure, unless they could have a&#xD;
strong confidence in their moral tr~dning; but when you&#xD;
purify the fountain, the stream will purify itself."&#xD;
"Well, sir, grant that your positions are all tenable,&#xD;
confess I would rejoice greatly in such a consummation&#xD;
of affairs. It would certainly be a desirable formation&#xD;
of society, verging very nearly to the ~period when the&#xD;
lion and the lamb are to lie down together. But I&#xD;
doubt very much the practicability of the plan, even&#xD;
provided the temperance portion of community should&#xD;
be entirely successful in the training of their children.&#xD;
Who, pray sir, is to give the drunkard's child his train-&#xD;
ing? low is he to become a pattern of sobriety and&#xD;
virtue ?"&#xD;
"Oh! I don't expect to hold myself responsible for&#xD;
every drunkard's family in the community; it's enough&#xD;
if I sweep my own door clean. Let my neighbor see to&#xD;
his own: I shall ha~ira enough to do$'&#xD;
"But is it wise to always have the door of tetupta-&#xD;
tion thrown wide open for the inexperienced and weak~&#xD;
&#xD;
minded to enter, with the fiery temptation always allur-&#xD;
ing through the whole journey of life? We all know&#xD;
from experience, when the heart is riot strengthened by&#xD;
Divine grace there are times in every experience when&#xD;
the heart more readily yields to temptation; when the&#xD;
moral perceptions are less capable of resistance; and I&#xD;
think we ought to remove the temptation, if it were only&#xD;
for the sake of the inexperienced."&#xD;
"Well, Mrs. Sloan, I must say, I am~tijl opposed to&#xD;
your petition on, the, ground of principt~ Can't peti~&#xD;
tion men to take away my liberties - can't indeed,&#xD;
madam, even to accommodate the ladies. Would like&#xD;
to please them; but don't feel like doing violence to my&#xD;
own conscience."&#xD;
"I will leave' you? Mr. Drake; but hope you will&#xD;
think better of the matter yet. I would like to see you&#xD;
throw yQur whole influence on the side of temperance&#xD;
for the sake of your sons."&#xD;
"Yes, niadai~i, you will always find me on that side.&#xD;
I only wish to do battle according to the dictates of my&#xD;
own conscience, and in my own way~"&#xD;
As soon as Mrs. Sloan was out of hearing, Mr. Drake&#xD;
said, turning to' Mr. Davis, a frequenter of the saloon,&#xD;
"Iii think she had a confounded sight better be at home,&#xD;
ironing her old man's shirts, or darning her children's&#xD;

an effort at contempt. "Now, didn't you~ see through&#xD;
all that? I~ There wasn't one spark of original-&#xD;
ity in ,all she hid. 'She had learned all that by rote out&#xD;
of some temperance speech; just like we used to learn&#xD;
declamations at school .- spouting off like Clay or Web..&#xD;
ster, when we never expected to be able even to imitate&#xD;

she. She knows a vast deal more about the dish-cloth&#xD;
and knitting-needle than getting up business for a Leg-&#xD;

The women are all running ~crazy, now-a-days, to be like&#xD;
the men - with theirWomen's Rights Conventions and*&#xD;
women speeches and all; and next they must be helping&#xD;
the Legislature along a little, have a finger in the pie&#xD;

thi~ig advisedly, at least, if Esq. Drake should be the&#xD;
successful caiididate for a seat in that august body at its&#xD;
next sitting, the busy-body ladies might just as well be&#xD;
saving shoe-leather; for I'll never be guilty of present-&#xD;
ing any such petitions."&#xD;
"But what would you do, Drake, if it would become&#xD;
popular with the party, and your constituents should&#xD;
instruct you ~o to do?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, in that case, I might have to runwith the hare,&#xD;
and hunt with the hounds. But I have little to fear on&#xD;
that subject. Our party leaders are better posted than&#xD;
all that would amount to. They knbw very well if they&#xD;
once touch the temperance question, the foreign vote&#xD;
would fly off like a tangent, and then we are good for&#xD;
falling into the minority~ very considerably. No, sir!&#xD;

they are too wide awake; sir. Why, sir, let ths pro-&#xD;
hibitory law pass, and we are a dead party-dead as a&#xD;

"How do you make that out?"&#xD;
"Plain, sir, as the hat on your head! First, we have&#xD;
our influence with a very large class of what might be&#xD;

the back room, and came back, wiping his lips on the&#xD;

considerably improved.&#xD;
"Well, Sale, if you want .to know why I have so&#xD;
much ~onfidence and such strong faith in the new tem-&#xD;
perance move, I'll tell you. You all know I never had&#xD;
a 'spark of faith in all their temperance pledges. Ive&#xD;
signed a good* i~iany myself, too, but, never had much&#xD;
faith; after all they're so easy got over.. But, I j~st&#xD;
tell you, the ladies now, as we call them, will get up&#xD;
these petitions, and lots, lots of them will sign them.&#xD;
And then they'll present them to the men, and there&#xD;
isn't one in every fifty~of, them that will begin to refuse&#xD;
their signature when the ladies ask them even if they&#xD;
are bitterly opposed to every thing of the kind. A. gen-&#xD;
tleman musn't say 'No,' to a lady, nohow; 'twou~4n't&#xD;
do,. sir; so they get a great many names that the best&#xD;
men in Christendom couldn't begin to touch."&#xD;
"What of all that, Joe? what of all that? You&#xD;
haven't got a prohibitory liquor law. yet. That's got&#xD;
to come from the Legislature, man, don't you know&#xD;

him that the impulses within and the temptations with-&#xD;

could hear her own 'heart beating; and memory was,&#xD;
probing, to its very depths, the fountain of her feelings,&#xD;
and thought was busy with the days of other years. In&#xD;
imagination, then, she was living over agaii~ the firs~&#xD;
years of her wedded life; and life seemed then one long&#xD;
day of. unclouded happiness;&#xD;
While Ma1ttie, sat thus, so entirely absorbed in her&#xD;
own reflections, there was a tap on the door. She flew&#xD;
to oper~ it, with her finger on her lip, lest the slightest&#xD;
move might wake the sleeper by whose bed she was&#xD;
keeping so anxious a watch. And she dreaded what&#xD;
mij4it follow. She moti~ued her visitors to follow to&#xD;
another room. They were Mrs. Judge Wood und Nora&#xD;
Wilmot. What brought them there to that home of&#xD;
poverty and disgrace? Mattie felt surprised; she 'had&#xD;
few acquaintances in her new home in the West -~sli~&#xD;
did not wish them, for she had heen reared in one of tha~&#xD;
best families in an eastern city, accustomed to elegance&#xD;
and refinement, been careft,~iUy educated in all the ele-&#xD;
gancies of female accomplishments, accustomed to move&#xD;
in 'the best circles of society. Mattie knew in her alter-&#xD;
ed situation that she could ~not move in the 'circles she&#xD;
had been fitted for, both, by education and ~s~ociatiou,&#xD;
and she would not bend her spirit to associat~~ith~h&#xD;

enjoying the same luxury himself, at the same hour of&#xD;

and cock.4ighting in which his~very promising son in-&#xD;
dulged so freely, only because there was no better ob-&#xD;

know so much? He wouldn't have believed the best&#xD;
friend~ he had if they had told him all about it; not he!&#xD;
It was hi8. very decided opinion that Harry wouldn't&#xD;
be seen at such a place! No,, sir ! harry, has a much&#xD;
better opinion of himself, and is niore choice of his so-&#xD;
ciety than all that would amount to; And so Harry grew&#xD;
up with little or no restrah4.-..with temptations both at&#xD;
home and abroad .~-sent oft' to college at an early age,&#xD;
and thrown into society where there were plenty of&#xD;
spirits far more reckless than himself--- for it. has to&#xD;
be acknowledged that southern colleges are not very&#xD;
appropriate safeguards against dissipation and idleness,&#xD;
and iiot always good schoolss of reform either.&#xD;
flaxry, after graduating with considerable honor to&#xD;
himself and credit to his instructors, returnedhome, with&#xD;
his habitat little better formed for sobriety than when. he&#xD;
had left the paternal mansion. ]3ut to the world he&#xD;
passed for a yogng gentleuian of high talents and ac~&#xD;
acknowledged ability, and was altogether worthy of his&#xD;
reputation. 4fter he bad spent two years. at a Law&#xD;
School, hi~ doting father pronounced him fully compe-&#xD;
tent to take an elevated stand among the great ones of&#xD;
the land. But, hi~ particular friends ~knew thathe, had&#xD;
I~een ~i the practice of indulging in his favorite ~lass&#xD;
daily; but that was no unusual oecarrenc~ in the society&#xD;
&#xD;
of which he Was a member, and it passed as a matter&#xD;
of but little importance. How little Harry Norton&#xD;
thought or feared the fatal consequences of the insati-&#xD;
able appetite he was even now feeding!&#xD;
When he had been some two years at the bar, Mattie&#xD;
Conway, a beautiful girl from Boston, came to spend a&#xD;
few months with an uncle residing in the vicinity of&#xD;
Captain Norton's, where Harry was in the habit of vis~~&#xD;
iting frequently. They met, and an acquaintance soon&#xD;
ripened into a mutual attachment. When Mattie re-&#xD;
turned to her eastern home, it was as the affianced bride&#xD;
of a southern suitor.&#xD;
In the autumn Harry went to claim his bride. It&#xD;
was his first visit to a free state, and he was so charmed&#xD;
with the air of enterprise and thrift he saw every where&#xD;
manifested, so altogether different from his native state,&#xD;
or the theory of southern influences, that it required but&#xD;
little persuasion from his new friends and matrimonial&#xD;
connexions to induce him to become a resident of a&#xD;
northern state. And Harry Norton was soon compet-&#xD;
ing, not unsuccessfully, with northern talent.&#xD;
For a few years, Harry's success was almost unparal-&#xD;
leled - he was fast rising into wealth, influence and&#xD;
popularity-gaining many friends in the home of his&#xD;
adoption that were good and true as long as he was true&#xD;
to himself. And Mattie was happy theu as ever young&#xD;
bride was, evei~ in the days of a first betrothal. Why&#xD;
should she not be, surrounded, as she was, by the friends&#xD;
of her youth, with father, mother, sisters and brothers&#xD;
surrounding liter, and within calling distance of the pa-&#xD;
ternal hearth-stone? And her young husband, so entire-&#xD;

&#xD;
ly all she could ask him to be in the most enthusiastic&#xD;
moments of young existence so string and proud,&#xD;
so self-i~eliant; and the young wife was proud, too, of&#xD;
his attainments, proud of his position, and proud of his&#xD;
popularity. And with all this outward seeming, he was&#xD;
one of the kindest of husbands, almost vain of hisbeau-&#xD;
tiful northern bride. And she so trustiI~g, thought what&#xD;
Harry said or done was all right, and wouldn't admit of&#xD;
a controversy.&#xD;
So time glided on to Harry and Mattie, without one&#xD;
riffle of adverse current, until two little cherub treasures&#xD;
had come to gladden their Eden home - a son, possess-&#xD;
ed of his father's bold, daring spirit, 'with more of south-&#xD;
ern ardoi~ and restlessness than his gentle sister, who was&#xD;
more like their doting mother. Poor Mattie almost&#xD;
fancied, in' her experience, 'that the measure of her hap-&#xD;
pinesswt~s full - how dared she ask for more? Alas&#xD;
for human happiness! when was it ever unalloyed? It&#xD;
has been ~aid~ well:&#xD;
* "They build too low who build. beneath the skies."&#xD;
And so Mattie Norton found ere she reached the me-&#xD;
ridian of the journey of life. Harry had always spent&#xD;
most of his evenings from home, except the first few&#xD;
months of hi~ married life, under a pretext of business.&#xD;
lEt ~vas a sfro~g drawback on Mattie's happiness, for&#xD;
she said that was all she wanted to complete her meas-&#xD;
ure of perfect bliss. The loving wife thought it would&#xD;
be so entirely a privilege to have Harry in of evenings.&#xD;
But he couldn't be a successful public character, and&#xD;
spend all his time at the fireside; and so Mattie was&#xD;
&#xD;
EVIL CONSEQUENCES.            235.&#xD;
satisfied to make the sacrifice. She had the society of&#xD;
her sweet babes; and, then, the knowledge of Harry's&#xD;
success made amends for all. But, then, Harry's stay-&#xD;
outs of evenings wer~ growing later and later. Some-~&#xD;
times' the faithful wife had to sit up till her eyes were&#xD;
weary, and her head would 'ache the next day; for&#xD;
she would not lie down till he came home, although he&#xD;
had chided her several times, telling her not to eApose'&#xD;
herself so for his sake. And, sometimes, Harry would&#xD;
be gone allnight, but always returned during the first&#xD;
noon of the day, with some perfectly plausible apology&#xD;
for his absence, that satisfied the unsuspecting wife.&#xD;
But there was soon to be an awakening from this&#xD;
happy dream of bliss; for Harry was brought home late&#xD;
one night very far advanced in a state of intoxication,&#xD;
with his clothes sadly torn, his hair (his beautiful brown,&#xD;
curling hair, that Mattie had always loved so well to&#xD;
smooth back from the broad, marble-like"brow, that she&#xD;
felt such a wifely pride in) all disheveled, and his&#xD;
handsome face marred and swollen by most brutaf&#xD;
abuse. Oh! what a sight for a young, kind, affection..~&#xD;
ate,. inexperieueed wife! She almost fainted with the&#xD;
first sight. lit seemed so very terrible, so dreadful!&#xD;
Her dear husband! what a sight he presented wheu he&#xD;
became conscious again. Could she believe the evi-&#xD;
deuces of her own senses ? Was her Harry indeed&#xD;
drunk? The mere thought of it made her head reel,&#xD;
and her heart sink within her. Life seemed as Wit,&#xD;
would go out with that first, great trouble, and tlii~&#xD;
cheek was so' deadly pale. .~ But then she thought there&#xD;
certainly will be some explanation, some~ palliatin~ cir~&#xD;

&#xD;
cumstances. Yes, Harry has been temptedd by nsso-&#xD;
ciates, induced to drink, and not being accustomed to&#xD;
stimulants as Mattie thinks, for she has never sus-&#xD;
pe~ted anything of the kind before~-so it took a pow-&#xD;
erful effect on his nervous system. And it wasn't so&#xD;
very bad after all, for it was the first time, and there are&#xD;
few :persons but what are 'liable to be overtaken in a&#xD;
fault sometime. The poor wife tried so hard to find&#xD;
some extenuating circumstances as an apology to her&#xD;
own wounded nature, something that might palliate, at&#xD;
least, the first rough edges of her grief. But, the , de-&#xD;
spite. all her apologies and excuses, all that affection&#xD;
could offer, there lies her own Harry, in a perfect stu-&#xD;
por, sleeping off the fumes of brandy,. all unconscious&#xD;
of external circumstances, and looking so little like&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
Eoor Mattie! what a hard lesson for one so young!&#xD;
But in all her trial she never once harbored one thought&#xD;
of. anger, or resentment, or blame to her husband; every&#xD;
feeling was either of pity or pure, womanly, disinter~.&#xD;
ested sympathy. What wife ever did do otherwise?&#xD;
Even if the poor inebriate one should,' in his paroxysms&#xD;
of madness, add personal abuse, she only pities and en-&#xD;
dures.&#xD;
Hard as Mrs. Norton now thought her lot, she was'&#xD;
just sipping from the brink of the cup that she was&#xD;
doomed. to drink to its very dregs, to quaff its bitter&#xD;
Iliarry was deeply mortified when he came to&#xD;
ihihiself and was told of what he had done, and seemed&#xD;
to try to make amends for his conduct in over-kindness&#xD;
to those whose feelings his reckless conduct had out&#xD;
&#xD;
raged. But it was only a short time until he wa~ over-&#xD;
taken in the same fault; and his friends soon found it&#xD;
waS only the gradual progress of a long established&#xD;
habit, one that had grown with his growth-an insa-&#xD;
tiable appetite, which, when once fed, only requires-&#xD;
more aliment, until, like the daughters of the horse&#xD;
leach, it ever cries, Give! give! Though its unfortunate&#xD;
victim be entirely conscious, the indulgence is like the&#xD;
famous vulture eating up his very vitals. While all&#xD;
the time conscious of danger, and knowing, from every&#xD;
day's experience, where the rocks lay hidden, against&#xD;
which so many barks have made shipwreck, with so&#xD;
much before him, to act as a warning, Harry Norton&#xD;
still pursued his course-feeding the thirst that was de-&#xD;
vouring him soul and body. He had indulged so long,&#xD;
commencing in early childhood, with a morning bitters,&#xD;
and increased as the appetite increased, until now it&#xD;
was second nature. lie didn't feel at all fit for busi-&#xD;
ness, in the morning, until his ideas were brightened&#xD;
and his nerves steadied by a little stimulant, and then&#xD;
he must have an extra dram before each meal, or he.&#xD;
would have no appetite. And so Harry Norton mighJ~&#xD;
be' set down a regular drinker, pretty well established.&#xD;
To all the entreaties and advice of faithful friends, h'&#xD;
only answer was, he was only treading in his father's&#xD;
footsteps, and didn't believe he was in much danger of&#xD;
filling a drunkard's grave. He knew plenty of men in&#xD;
Virginia that had taken their bitters regularly, frog"&#xD;
boyhood down to ~old age, and then died without being&#xD;
drunkards. He didn't see any kind of use in making 80&#xD;
much extra fuss about temperance, and temperance socie~~&#xD;

&#xD;
ties, and temperance pledges; his name would ncver&#xD;
be found on any such paper; 'twas all 'fuss for nothing;&#xD;
gotten up by a set of demagogues for an electioneering~&#xD;
hobby, nothing else; any man, that was worth calling&#xD;
a man, could quit drinking whenever he wished to.&#xD;
Harry said he intended to use less than he had been in-&#xD;
dulging in for some time past'; he never did intend&#xD;
using the article to excess. But, then, used only to a&#xD;
reasonable extent, it wouldn't injure any man; indeed,&#xD;
he thought it was highly beneficial to health, it had&#xD;
always been so considered in 'his native state. He&#xD;
knew a great many men that were professing Christians&#xD;
that had drank temperately all their lives, and had died&#xD;
as they had lived. Needn't tell him a man couldn't&#xD;
drink or taste one drop without being in danger of fill.~&#xD;
ing a drunkard's grave, as the northern fanatics were&#xD;
always saying. He never knew of such a thing as a.&#xD;
temperance society in his native state, and every man in&#xD;
the state didn't get drunk either,&#xD;
But Harry Norton didn't know while he was thus&#xD;
tampering with the worm of the still, that, like a ser-&#xD;
pent in the grass, it was preparing its coil to make him&#xD;
a more certain prey, drawing him, like the charmed&#xD;
bird, within its coils, until his powers of resistance&#xD;
would be too weak to offer any 'opposition. And the&#xD;
poor victim was only awakened to any sense of danger&#xD;
when he found his prosperous business fast leaving his&#xD;
hands, and going into the hands of his temperate asso-&#xD;
ciates, whom Harry had never recognized as anything'&#xD;
like equals in point of 'talent and professional ability.&#xD;
And his friends turned' in disgust from one who would~&#xD;
not~ listen to one word of counsel or advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
Poor Mattie saw all this with an aching heart, and&#xD;
could not br&amp;amp;ok the thought of living in degradatioti,&#xD;
surrounded by her early associates. Thinking a change&#xD;
of associations and scenes might be beneficial in work-&#xD;
ing a change for the better, she persuaded her husband&#xD;
to emigrate' to the West, vainly hoping it might be a&amp;amp;&#xD;
vantageous. With the courage and devotion of an&#xD;
energetic wife and mother, she bade adieu to parents,&#xD;
and friends, and childhood's scenes, to make a home&#xD;
among strangers, with only a drunken husband and her&#xD;
two little ones.&#xD;
Harry did partially reform when he came tQ his new&#xD;
home, Seeming quite himself again. And Mattie thought&#xD;
the sacrifice of home and friends but a trifling sacrifice,&#xD;
if it only did result in her husband's entire reformation.&#xD;
Again he was successful in' business, for Harry Norton&#xD;
was possessed of a genius of no ordinary mould of ca..&#xD;
abilities, that might have given hjm a high position&#xD;
among his fellow men, 'and been of signal advantage to&#xD;
hig country. How lamentable it is that so much of the&#xD;
most promising talent of our country should be sacri-&#xD;
ficed on the same ~dtar and' to the same deity.&#xD;
But the new found hopes were doomed to be of short&#xD;
duration. The unnatural appetite was not quenched,&#xD;
it was only restrained a little while, and seemed' have&#xD;
been gaining strength by the temporary restraint; for&#xD;
be was soon seen to be drinking more than ever, indeed&#xD;
he seldom came home sober, and sometimes was so eu~&#xD;
tirely besotted that he was altogether unconscious of&#xD;
surrounding circumstances, and his devoted wife would&#xD;
be necessitated to assist him to bed, where he would gen-&#xD;
erally sleep off the immediate effects of his excesses.&#xD;

How near the sufferer's heart was to breaking only&#xD;
herself could tell. ]3uV she had to exert herself for the&#xD;
sake of those who would have been worse than orphaned&#xD;
but for her protection and care.&#xD;
Harry's dreadful excesses brought on a severe fit of&#xD;
the drunkard's madness, in its most aggravated form.&#xD;
Oh! how he did suffer! Raving with every iruagin aiy&#xD;
horror until nature was almost entirely exhausted; and&#xD;
then there was such a struggle between life and death,&#xD;
as if poor human nature never again could rally after&#xD;
such an unwanted abuse of her latent powers. Matte&#xD;
had prayed as she never prayed before for strength to&#xD;
bear the. blow, for she lived in hourly expectation of&#xD;
being left alone, with her orphaned children, in a strange&#xD;
place, surrounded by stranger faces. But He who tem~&#xD;
pereth the wind to the shorn lamb had ordered other-&#xD;
wise, and again her husband was restored to health, in&#xD;
some degree, but not to sobriety. Like many others&#xD;
have 4one before, Harry felt wretched, and turned to the&#xD;
fatal cup again to drown all his troubles and bitter re~&#xD;
elections in the excitement of dissipation, until we again&#xD;
find him laboring under the same fearful sufferings, and&#xD;
his desolate wife almost in despair.&#xD;
,Perhaps our readers may claim an apology for so&#xD;
long a digression. When our lady visitors called, we&#xD;
find every thing in the ~present tense in the matter of&#xD;
suffering. But Mattie, real heroine as she is, ha~4'or-&#xD;
gotten her own misery in the contemplation of her hus-&#xD;
band's sufferings; never once suffering the suggestion&#xD;
* that his is self-inflicted to so much as intrude into her&#xD;

means to alleviate his dreadful misery.&#xD;

What a gleani of sunshiri~ seemed to hav~e shot&#xD;
athwart her pathway at the announcement of the prop-&#xD;
osition to endeavor to procure the passage of a prohib.~&#xD;

could ever be entirely relieved from temptation.. Itwas a&#xD;
consummation she had never so muckaa anticipated. In&#xD;
her deep distress she had pondered many; many plans,&#xD;
but all were abandoned as fruitless; because. Harry&#xD;
never would consent to listen to any suggestions of re-&#xD;
striction or restraint for the sake of reformation, always&#xD;
contending that he had the moral ability. to reform,&#xD;
without outward assistance-8aying all tb~ while he&#xD;
intended to reform so&amp;amp;n, but all the while sinkiug l~w~r&#xD;
and lower in the scale of degradation.&#xD;
How very, willingly,. even* gladly, did Mrs. N'~rto~i&#xD;
sign her name to that petition, with an inward prayer,&#xD;
so heart-felt, that it might be successful. It was so&#xD;
plausible, so reasonable. Like a light shining in a dark,&#xD;
place, it would be such a safeguard, like a wall of de..&#xD;
fense, for the most abandoned, beside being a shield to&#xD;
youthful feet.&#xD;
If there was no more drink, oh! the blessed relief!&#xD;
there could, as a contingent consequence, be no more&#xD;
drinking. What a balm to the wounded spirit! Mat-&#xD;
tie's heart was melted in very thankfulness with the&#xD;
blessed prospect. If Harry only would entirely reform&#xD;
and be himself once more, they might again be so happy.&#xD;
She had entire confidence that her gifted husband did'&#xD;
possess rare abilities and talents to insure him success&#xD;
in any avocation in life, when not prostrated by this de.&#xD;

The ladies were much interested in all they had seen&#xD;
'and heard. They were interested not only for Mrs.&#xD;
N~orton, but for her interesting family, and pronlibed&#xD;
before leaving to interest themselves in procuring gom-&#xD;
pany to sit with her, in her 'lonely vigil, through that&#xD;
anxious night, and to call again and see how they were&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
ITEMS OP INTEREST.&#xD;
It seemed a long time since Cousin Nora had heard&#xD;
any thing of Susie Rayburn. And they had always&#xD;
been like sisters. So Nora~sat down and wrote a long,&#xD;
long letter to Susie. We think both Kora and Susie&#xD;
will excuse us, if we do take a peep into a portion of&#xD;
their letter. But, then, we know there is a portion of&#xD;
this interesting epistle that had better not be made pub-&#xD;
lic. For, if we premise right, Cousin Nora wouldn't&#xD;
just entirely fancy having all the particulars about that&#xD;
friendly letter made public. You know young ladies&#xD;
like to have some things kept secret. And we consent&#xD;
to their having some rights that we don't feel just will.&#xD;
ing to intrude on. So you needn't expect to know any&#xD;
thing about that part, unless you can get Miss Nora's&#xD;
consent. The letter ran thus-.--that is, our part of it:&#xD;
"DJ~AR SUSIE :.-Jt is 'a long time since I have 'heard&#xD;
from you, and so much of interest has been transpiring&#xD;
here, in which I know you would take a deep concern,&#xD;
that I will devote this evening to making you acquainted&#xD;
with all our doings since I last wrote you. Perhaps&#xD;
you recollect we had heard, before you left, that Charley&#xD;
Price was drinking worse than ever again. It all&#xD;
turned out to be too 'true. He went from bad to worse,&#xD;
until he~' got to abusing his family in a most shameful&#xD;
manner and, at last, turned the poor things out of&#xD;
doors in a bleak storm, almost breaking poor Mary's&#xD;

heart! So, a few ladies of us, with Mrs. Judge Wood,&#xD;
and Mrs. Dr. GilberLan~1 pastor Monroe's wife, together&#xD;
with some dozen others of 'the most enthusiastic temper~&#xD;
ance advocates - and Cousin ~ora, of course after&#xD;
petitioniu~g a Mr. Amos Tradewell, 'who kept one of&#xD;
Those detestable saioo~s, right on'the corner of' the&#xD;
street where Charley bad 'to pass every time he went to oi'&#xD;
returned from busine~s. This Tradewell had been an&#xD;
.o]d scl~olrnate .of Charley's, and Susie thought if this&#xD;
salmon was only closed, Charley would reform. You&#xD;
know tern~e~~~e ladies never refuse the entreaties, of a&#xD;
suffering sisters. Well, Mr. Tradewell saw fit tQ refuse&#xD;
to comply with the very litixuble petition sent in~ on the&#xD;
ground of wishing~' to enjoy the privilege of attending&#xD;
to his own Etisiness. Then'the ladies, to the number of&#xD;
twelve or fifteen at a time, prepared each with a job of&#xD;
knitting work, proceeded to the aforesaid ~aloon, to have&#xD;
a. grand knittingg concert. Well, we knitted on some&#xD;
three days." On the fourth Mr. Tradewell made over~&#xD;
tures for a capitulation. So, all things being' signed,&#xD;
sealed, and the' traffic closed I~orever, as far as Mr.&#xD;
'Tradewell was concerned, the committee took their de~&#xD;
parture. And very glad they were of a release, too, on.&#xD;
their parts.4--~ visitors and visited' being inntuaUy tired&#xD;
of the little dramatic farce;&#xD;
Th'e~ reform' spirit' being wide awake, and all things&#xD;
astir for an' :enterprise,'it was next proposed to inaije an&#xD;
effort for the 'grand 1lnale~te the whole traffic. ~An4, for&#xD;
theist week, the~Ladies1 Temperance Committee have&#xD;
been busily' employed soliciting signatures to a petition&#xD;

This m~ttWr of petition is to be' general all over the~&#xD;

Of course the petition will be presented in yonr town,~&#xD;

Then follows a long list of private matters that I told&#xD;
you we had no right to know any thing about, unless the&#xD;
writer were to give the privilege first. But, kind reader,&#xD;
if-we may be permitted to premise a little, although we&#xD;
don't wish to be understood as claiming to be at all in&#xD;
the secret, only as claiming to be right good at guessing&#xD;
about 8mall matters.&#xD;
As ~we said about promising, we think, when Nora&#xD;
does seer Susie again, Fred Morley will be in company;&#xD;
and, it may be, we'll hear of a wedding first. But we&#xD;
don't wish to be accused of prying into other people's&#xD;
business.~-.especially young ladies' secrets. Let them&#xD;
have their own business in their own hands, dear souls,&#xD;
say we!&#xD;
We don't want to know any thing more than they're&#xD;
willing to ~iiih4~de to us. So Miss Nora's secret's en~&#xD;
tirely safe yet, for we've not told any thing- and don't&#xD;
intend to, either, even if we knew. I3ut, 'pon honor,&#xD;
we don't knoi~r, we've only guessed this much, and we've&#xD;
a right to guess, and if we hit the nail on the head, why,&#xD;
we can't help it - we'll only have to be forgiven, for we&#xD;
live in a free country. But, then, we wouldn't want&#xD;
things so free, that every one could meddle with his&#xD;
neighbor's business; for we wouldn't be at all pleased&#xD;
with having every persOn intruding into our business.&#xD;
But, after all, ~we guess Fred. Morley will soon experi~&#xD;
ence the happiest period of a man's life if there is&#xD;
any thing to be judged by signs. Now, don't be saying.&#xD;
we make auy pretensions to knowing any thing about&#xD;
the matter, for we never said we did, and don't intend&#xD;
to take such an accusation at all kindly or in good part;&#xD;
&#xD;
wouldn't consider such an accusation at all neighborly,&#xD;
by any means. We propose waiting to see :what turn~&#xD;
affairs will be taking, holding ourselves in readiness for:&#xD;
any emergency that may turn up.&#xD;
After writing to Susie, Nora concluded to drop th~&#xD;
letter in the office herself ~ and, as her walk wiuld. leact&#xD;
in the direction of the shanty of her little friend. Michael,,&#xD;
she proposed~ to herself to call and see if they still kept&#xD;
the bottle filled with cold water, instead of rum; and&#xD;
whether the parents had any more encounters, and how~&#xD;
Michael was doing by the present time.&#xD;
Before she got half through the yard, Michael espiel&#xD;
her, and raising his hand, and stretching his large, round.&#xD;
blue eyes to their utmost tension, with a look of astou~&#xD;
ished delight, he called out at~the top of his ~roice,.&#xD;
"Oh, either! mither! there's the leddy.....-there's the&#xD;
leddy-~ that emptied out feather's rum, so you an&amp;amp;&#xD;
feather didn't fight no more. 'Tis so, wither."&#xD;
Biddy Mahoning was soon at the door to welcome&#xD;
Nora into her really tidy little abode. Every thing&#xD;
looked so very different from the appearance it pre-~&#xD;
sented on the occasion of her last visit, when she had&#xD;
found every thing much after the fashion of Irish shan~~&#xD;
ties in general. But now every thing presented a marked&#xD;
change in their appearance; the bed was covered with a&#xD;
clean spread and white cases; the dishes were washed&#xD;
clean, and arranged with neatness and order on the side&#xD;
dresser; the floor, that before was~ almost twin cousin.&#xD;
with the street, was now cleanly scrubbed, scarce dry&#xD;
from the mops; and the line of~clean, smoothly ironed&#xD;
clothes, hanging drying in the sun, told, in language&#xD;

with so much cheerfulness too, by the wives of drinking&#xD;

"Stranger things than that might happen, and more&#xD;
lamentable ones, too, Uncle," and Nora looked in her&#xD;
benefactor's face with a smile: "but 'heaven knows all&#xD;
about it, and the gentle influence so quietly and unos-&#xD;
tentatiouly exerted will be' great records in the angel's&#xD;
book."&#xD;
Mrs. Grey came down, which closed the interesting&#xD;
little tete~a-tete .A.ttnt Grey was a~ fashionable lady, at&#xD;
the head of' a fashionable establishment. She couldn't&#xD;
&#xD;
by any means be persuaded to rise before a fashionable&#xD;
hour admitted of; or retire one hour too soon. She&#xD;
seemed to possess tic higher ambition than to eat, and&#xD;
sleep, and think, and talk, and dress, and to live in all&#xD;
things as othj~r ladies of fashion did. But then we&#xD;
needn't wonder so very much at Mrs. Grey, after all;&#xD;
she had been raised by just such a mother, and, in just&#xD;
the same style; had never yet known anything but pros-&#xD;
perity and affluence. TLerself the only child of rich, in-&#xD;
dulgent parents, and living in the indulgence of every&#xD;
fashionable folly that wealth could command. Married,&#xD;
too, at an early age, to a husband of equal indulgence,&#xD;
never having met with any adverse circumstance, or&#xD;
even providential affliction. Death had never yet dark-&#xD;
ened~ her household, or even th~ paternal mansion; she&#xD;
had seen other mothers weep over their bereavements,.&#xD;
but she could not sympathize with them, because her&#xD;
household jewels were yet unbroken, and her pi~rents&#xD;
still spared to her. She had gone. with her husband&#xD;
when he had been summoned to the death bed, of his&#xD;
sister, Nora's mother; but if she wept at the deaVk&#xD;
scene, it was only because her husband's heart was&#xD;
touched. And when her husband proposed adopting,&#xD;
the desolate orphaned one as their own, she assented&#xD;
with apparent heart-felt tenderness.&#xD;
Aunt Grey was what the world would term a woman&#xD;
of the world, judging from externals alone; although&#xD;
she had a pew in. a fashionable church, most elaborately&#xD;
cushioned, with a root-stool equally well arranged for&#xD;
comfort, and sat stately every Sabbath day and listened&#xD;
to a logical discourse, delivered by~ the verylearnedfl. D.,&#xD;

unusual; he has just graduated, after a close confine-&#xD;

close, too, during his college course. But ~Mr; Grey&#xD;
is just now contemplating the important matter of a set-&#xD;

a seat in his office as a student of law, with the proffer&#xD;
of a partnership at the completion of his~studies. But&#xD;
Mr. Grey feels some solicitude about sending his son~so&#xD;

knows she must be lonely, poor thing, away off in that&#xD;
backwoods place, with no privileges of society or amuse-&#xD;
ments. She does wish Rayburn had not gone there;&#xD;
and now he is a candidate for the Legislature, and that&#xD;
will keep bun from home so. much. She doesn't know~&#xD;
what poor Susie will do away among strangers, poor&#xD;
thing.&#xD;
Mark has added his influence to his mother's, and Mr.&#xD;
Grey has yielded to superiority of numbers, not because&#xD;
his judgments convinced, but because he can't oppose&#xD;
his oyri~ family; his nature is too kind for that, and he&#xD;
enjoys indulging them too well.&#xD;
And so Mark is to go in three months to Susie's west-&#xD;
ern home, to mingle in new scenes and new society; to&#xD;
form new friendships, and, it may be, new temptations.&#xD;
Cousin Nora inwardly hopes the temperance cause is&#xD;
in~a healthy condition where Mark is going, for she&#xD;
hasn't forgotten what Susie. told her of Mark's iriduig-&#xD;
ingjp an occasional champagne supper with Fred Mor-&#xD;
iey~4d Aif Rayburn. Kora has the idea now, that she&#xD;
will get Fred Morley to influence Mark to give his sig-&#xD;
nature to a prohibitory pledge, that has been circulating&#xD;
for some time. The cause has taken quite an impetus&#xD;
since the ladies have been exerting themselves so stren-&#xD;
uou~1~ That will be a safeguard against temptations&#xD;
in that line; for Nora has confidence that Mark will&#xD;
keep, with almost a religious obligation, any pledge he&#xD;
might be induced to make. And she is glad he is going,&#xD;
for Susie's sake. From what she has gathered from&#xD;
S~isie's letters, although she has said in. each one she&#xD;
was so very happy, Nora's quick-sighted penetration&#xD;
&#xD;
has discovered, or thinks she has, a little drawback, as&#xD;
if 'twas not entirely without alloy. And too well&#xD;
Nora feared she understands why Susie has to spend so&#xD;
many evenings alone. But she will not excite her fears,&#xD;
she will only hope for the best.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
TUE MA.~IAG MOTUEB~&#xD;
Well, gentle reader, next week there is to be another&#xD;
wedding at Uncle Grey's; but this time there will be no&#xD;
,large reception party, and no great stir of any kind.-.&#xD;
the current of events will suffer but a slight riffle'; only&#xD;
a few choice friends will be into breakfast. The wedding&#xD;
will be a very private one: and then a little company&#xD;
will depart on the cars westward. 'T is Nora's notion!&#xD;
Well, Nora, like other young ladies when they are&#xD;
contemplating some great change in their situation,&#xD;
always have some preparations to make sometimes&#xD;
some purchases, too. So Nora, having tied on her bon-&#xD;
net, went down street to do a little shopping. Just as&#xD;
~she turned the corner of Smith and Bateman streets, she&#xD;
came in contact with a female of a very striking appear-&#xD;
ance. She was dressed in deep mourning, with the cx-&#xD;
'ception of a vail, which almost entirely hid her features,&#xD;
and reaching almost to her very feet, of a dazzling&#xD;
white. She was very tall, with a commanding dignity,&#xD;
almost queenly. Her step was very light, and altogether&#xD;
she had the air of one reared in the higher walks of life.&#xD;
As she came towards 'her, Nora noticed what a very&#xD;
small foot and beautifully rounded ancle she had, and so&#xD;
very graceful a step. Just as the strange lady came in&#xD;
contact with Nora, she laid her small hand on Ndra's&#xD;
shoulder, and, stopping her suddenly, said, in 'a very&#xD;
musical voice, "My dear! did you find him? Was he&#xD;
&#xD;
there, indeed?" Then, as if startled by not recognizing&#xD;
Nora, she retreated several paces. But Nora's look of&#xD;
inquiring conceiu seemed to reassure her; for she said,&#xD;
with, a look of disappointment and a sad smile, "It's&#xD;
Eddie I want, Did you see him? They say they've&#xD;
killed him! Did' they) my dear? They would u't do&#xD;
that, would they? Qh!" she said with a shudder, "he&#xD;
used to be so good I Didn't he, dear ?" ~Il the while&#xD;
holding Noni. by the arm. The woman turned sound,&#xD;
and threw back h~r ~Vail, which gave N~ora a view ~f her&#xD;
face. She was at least at the meridian of life, and there&#xD;
were deep lines of suffering and sorrow on her beautiful&#xD;
countenance which told of inward anguish. Nora ~aw&#xD;
that her mind wandered, and felt a little misgiving as to&#xD;
the safety of her position~ But still the woman held..&#xD;
her arm tightly, and looked into her face so inquiringly.&#xD;
"They killed his poor father, you know!" and she came&#xD;
up as she said this, whispering close to Nora's ear, in a&#xD;
choked, husky tone of voice~-" I know~. that, and it&#xD;
almost broke my heart; but I have Eddis~ left still "-&#xD;
as if she had forgotten for a moment her fears. "You&#xD;
don't think they'd kill Eddie, my poor fatherless boy 1-...&#xD;
my Eddie?" she said, with such a moving tenderness,&#xD;
and with so much sadness, that Nora trembled with ex~&#xD;
citen~ent. "They say," she continued, ~" he's drowned!&#xD;
Oh, drowned! would n't it be so dreadful? 'T would&#xD;
be enough to break j~is poor mother'a hear't, iw~w would,&#xD;
it not, dear? His poor father was killed along time&#xD;
ago, and there is n't any body but Eddie and me." A&#xD;
bright ~smile' played over the features of the strange&#xD;
maniac, which showed that' the beautiful face had not&#xD;

always been a stranger to cheerfulness; as, looki~gujj~,&#xD;
she seemed to catch an entirely new idea, and said, al-&#xD;
most playfully, "Why, fie! I sent Eddie to college&#xD;
there 's where he is, dear! Ain't you glad, now? I&#xD;
know somebody got drowned, and they said it was Ed..&#xD;
die. Was n't it a queer mistake, after o~ll ?" She let&#xD;
go of Nora's arm with the pleasing anticipation of her&#xD;
darling's safety, and, turning round, tripped lightly along&#xD;
at Nora's side.&#xD;
Nora had noticed all the time of the singular inter-&#xD;
view, that the stranger grasped something tightly in her&#xD;
hand which she kept looking at every little pause in the&#xD;
- conversation. As they came to a shop-door, Nora said,&#xD;
"I must stop here."&#xD;
The woman caught hei hand quick as thought, saying,&#xD;
"Oh! you must see Eddie! Don't you want to see&#xD;
Eddie?" at the same time 1~ouching the spring of a&#xD;
locket, beautifully inlaid with diamonds, disclosing a&#xD;
picture that Kora thinks she will never forget there&#xD;
was such an almost bewitching beauty in the half-boyish,&#xD;
half-manly features of the face; the lips slightly sepa..&#xD;
rated as if just ready to speak; the high, open brow,&#xD;
whereon innocence reposedas pure as moonlight sleep-&#xD;
ing upon snow; the mouth, so almost childishly beauti-&#xD;
ful and life-like, you almost fancied, as you gazed upon&#xD;
it, that you could catch the expression of young smiles&#xD;
just struggling into being; and in the clear, hazel eye,&#xD;
there was that in the depth of their expression, as if the&#xD;
deep, blue sea could not reflect with more fidelity the&#xD;
summer clouds that pass over it, than did those eyes&#xD;
the varying shadows of the mind they seemed the re-&#xD;
&#xD;
flected' image of those of the strange attendant, only&#xD;
wanting the look of wildness; and then there was alniost&#xD;
a girl-like beauty in that face, set oft' by the hardier&#xD;
firmness of the boy's character; That face is stamped on&#xD;
Nora's memory with its original distinctness. "That's&#xD;
Eddie !" and the poor maniac looked at the face eagerly&#xD;
yet affectionately. "Oh I isn't he handsome, dear?&#xD;
And he was as good as he is beautiful, before he went to&#xD;
college," and her voice sank to a sad whisper. "But&#xD;
he's not killed though, is he, poor boy? No body would&#xD;
drown him, would they? I know they would n't drown&#xD;
such a handsome boy as Eddie is; and then he's so good&#xD;
to his ma, is n't he? Oh! he does lov~e his ma! Poor&#xD;
dear One! he has no p&amp;amp;to kve now! No I no! there&#xD;
is n't any body but Eddie and me now! '~ and she never&#xD;
once moved her eyes off the locket. Turning it over,&#xD;
and touching another spring, she said, pointing to the&#xD;
other side, "This is Eddie's pa-they killed him! Oh!&#xD;
was n't that horrible! horrible 'I They got him to drink,&#xD;
and then they killed him -stabbed him in the heart!&#xD;
Oh, yes, dear! they stabbed him right through the heart!&#xD;
Oh! "and she held her hand on her heart as if to still&#xD;
its fearful throbbing, "was n't it hard to bear, dear?&#xD;
Oh! so hard I And then his face settled down so cold&#xD;
and still -he never spoke to me again; and then they&#xD;
brought him home, all covered with blood. I hardly&#xD;
remember what they said to me. Eddie was a little,&#xD;
tiny, wee thing, then, and did n't know his pa; but oh!&#xD;
his pa was so good-to us -so good! lie nevir came&#xD;
home whe~i he was drinking though; and then when he&#xD;
did come, ~he'd look so sorry that he had been drinking,&#xD;

face of him who had been the treasured idol of her&#xD;
young heart~a purest affections as if life would go out&#xD;
with that long, earnest gaze. "That is my husband;&#xD;
dear! "and the poor bewildered one shook her head so&#xD;
mournfully.&#xD;
Nora coul4 nQt but wonder at the marked nobleness&#xD;
of the life-like features before her, and the trnly exquis~&#xD;
itely intellectual developments, with the striking reseim~&#xD;
blauce to the boy-man face of ~ddie,. as' her mysterious&#xD;
acquaintance had said. There was the same open brQw,&#xD;
but so strongly' marked by intellect; the same e~pres-&#xD;
Siou in the. parted lips. Noi~a thought there was a lit-&#xD;
tie want of firmness in the expression of the mouth.&#xD;
Only the eyes w~ere a very dark, clearly defined blue,&#xD;
but intensely bright : all else were so ~trikiugly alike.&#xD;
"Was n't he handsome, dear ? "she inquired, closing&#xD;
the 'locket, and-placing it in her bosom so securely..--.&#xD;
right' against her heart. "They shan't have that, if&#xD;
they have killed all .-.~.oh, ftc! now what made me say&#xD;
that? Eddie is n't killed; he's at school now, after all.:&#xD;
Oh, my head gets a little foolish sometiine~ that makes&#xD;
inc say that. No I no 1" and again she shook her head&#xD;
mournfully. "Eddie was good before he went to cob&#xD;
l~ge; hi4 he isn't like himself now." ~And again she&#xD;
whispered in Nora's ear, "They say he drinks some-&#xD;
timesi Oh, is n~t it too. bad! Deaiy me! Deary me-I&#xD;
They won't 'kill him, will they, deai"'? May be he'll be&#xD;
good again when he eomes home from school I"&#xD;
Just Then little girl, of scarce ten summers, came&#xD;
tripping.down the~street, andy looking in the face of the&#xD;
strange maniac, said:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Aunty,' ma wants you quick; she did n't know where&#xD;
you were."&#xD;
"Oh! didn't she? I only came to find Eddie I"&#xD;
And the poor, bereaved one suffered herself to be. led&#xD;
back by that little child, perfectly passively: her whole&#xD;
remaining intellect seeming entirely absorbed in the one&#xD;
subject of her heart's great bereavements&#xD;
Nora stood half-bewildered for several moments&#xD;
scarcely conscious of surrounding objects -reflecting on&#xD;
the singular adventure; ti king first of the beautiful&#xD;
maniac, and then of Eddie and his pa, as the inysteri-&#xD;
ous one had said ; ~and she seemed- to read the history&#xD;
of the' three as if by a kind Qf secret instinct. Then&#xD;
came the heart-sickening thought. The. maniac wife&#xD;
had said in her delirium, "They. got him, to drinking,&#xD;
and then they killed him! ". 'There 'was a volume in&#xD;
those words. But they are for the great record on high)&#xD;

Nora felt in no very enviable mood for con~ple:Ling&#xD;

search of some clue to the mysteries that were just&#xD;

to proceed, were questions not so easily attained as blond&#xD;

Nora watd~ed the objects of her solicitude until they&#xD;
turned irkto another street, and then she lost sight of&#xD;
them. That there was a tale hanging on the mystic&#xD;
interview, she felt quite sure of, but how to get a clue to&#xD;
it was quite another matter. But Kora has a fund of&#xD;
ingenuity and enterprise that seldom ever fails her, and&#xD;
above every thing she does love a wee bit of singular or&#xD;
romantic adventure now and then. Having completed&#xD;
her routine of shopping and returned home, Nora found&#xD;
Fred Morley in waiting, some time, sitting tete-a-tete&#xD;
with Mrs. Grey. Our enthusiastic heroine could scarce&#xD;
restrain her curiosity until the first civilities were over.&#xD;
Morley said, "Why, Miss Nora, something~agreeable&#xD;
or exciting must have occurred during your walk, to&#xD;
have given you so fine a~ glow and so much vivacity."&#xD;
"Well," said No2ra, "I can't say I met with any thing&#xD;
very agreeable, but very exciting I certainly did," and&#xD;
she related all the strange particulars of her new adven-&#xD;
ture, even to the mysterious hint about the drinking, and&#xD;
the peculiar beauty of all the parties concerned, and the&#xD;
so oft-repeated ejaculation that "Eddie wasn't dead,&#xD;

Aunt Grey expressed more concern than Nora ever&#xD;
recollected to have seen ber exhibit at any thing not&#xD;

most strange 'occurrence, ~and said, with more than her&#xD;
wanted animation:&#xD;
"Why, who can they be? I should so much like to&#xD;
know who the maniac is, and what of her early charac-&#xD;
ter and histo~. There is something really exciting in&#xD;
the circumstance,"&#xD;
&#xD;
i ;%&#xD;
&#xD;
Nora thought so, if it could arouse and excite Aunt&#xD;
Grey so much as to interest her feeling&amp;amp;&#xD;
"Wellf~ said Morley, "~ my opinions are, that there is&#xD;
romance enough locked up, ,and yet to be disclosed, in&#xD;
that littJe adventure,, no doubt, and in the~ history .of the&#xD;

may yet know more about them. Your recital has in-&#xD;

wild, unsteady eye, that I could almost read the ~eri~ihle&#xD;
suffering and grief through which she must have passed,&#xD;
to so entirely dethrone reason 1"&#xD;
It had been no ordinary struggle! For the head was&#xD;
strongly marked for an intellect of. no ordinary capacity.&#xD;

to the eye of. the beholder! .Trouhle must have~ swept&#xD;
like an avalanche of sorrow ovet her soul I it was&#xD;
written in every lineament ~f her striking features!&#xD;

when sh~ looked~ 'at'the miniature of her son, I never&#xD;

intense love, an almost idolatry, in that look. And&#xD;
when she said, 'Isn't he handsome?' there was a yearn-&#xD;
ing pride lit up her bewildered countenance, that ~showed&#xD;
the mothers innate pride for her beautiful, her bright&#xD;

she first accosted me, 'Did you find him ?-Was he&#xD;

to find a shelter for their unprotected heads. And one&#xD;
of his children was sick at the sa1me time, too, he told&#xD;
.me. But his new landlord told him he must leave in&#xD;
three days' tinie, or he would pitch him and all 'he had&#xD;
into the street without further notice, for he knew he&#xD;
would never get one cent of rent from such as he. was&#xD;
he owed him a larger bill now at the saloon than he&#xD;
ever expected to collect."&#xD;
"Yes," 'said Nora, with heightened color~ "and the&#xD;
exposure did 'come near taking the life of his little girl.&#xD;
You recollect, Aunt, Susie and I went to see them. The&#xD;

w~s getting much better."&#xD;

up ~that man's business in hand..' I thought they were&#xD;

of pride and affection in the mother's tones, "has been&#xD;
raised so entirely different, and was always so amiable&#xD;

have almost entirely as much influence over him as his&#xD;
father would have. And, then, he is Susie's idol. They&#xD;
were always so strongly attached to each other, that I&#xD;
did not want them ever to be separated."&#xD;
Neither Nora' nor Morley made any reply to the fond&#xD;

of which we recognized that of old Joe Miller, in a&#xD;
state bordering on excitement: "Hurrah! it's worth&#xD;

went flying off at a rapid rate.&#xD;
"Hurrah for old Maine! that set us such a glorious&#xD;
example," shouted another vAce.&#xD;
"We've got a liquor pledge now that we can't break&#xD;
if we want to," chimed in another voice, "and glad of&#xD;

"That we ar?, and no mistake. Give us entire pro-&#xD;

be able to take care of it when we get there, besides.&#xD;

man that was recognized as one that had taken conserv-&#xD;
ative grounds on the prohibitory question, ,and had&#xD;
finally voted against the measure.&#xD;
"And two whisky punches," sajd a second of the&#xD;
same school.&#xD;
"And I think it's a grand pity your head wasn't well&#xD;
punched," said old old Joe. -&#xD;
"And three gin cocktails," said a third, "and all drink&#xD;
a health to the new move and a farewell to the old.&#xD;
Come boys, who'll go?" But, to the gratification of&#xD;
all well-wishers of society, the three speakers had to&#xD;
hear each other company. And Joe Miller chu%~kled to&#xD;
himself as he watched them enter that sink of iniquity&#xD;
and (~urruption, and said, "Well, they'll find they're not&#xD;
going to get old Joe so easily; he's not going to dis-&#xD;
appoint Lucy's hopes this time; he'll be more of a ma~&#xD;
than that, a great sight, no mistake. Joe's going to have&#xD;
a broadcloth, coat, and a new hat, and &amp;amp; better house,&#xD;
too, for Mrs. Miller to live in, and better clothes for&#xD;
her and children to go to church in. Hurrah for better&#xD;
times!" and again the rimless hat swung round in the&#xD;
air with locomotive speed. All joined in the hearty&#xD;
rejoicing over the better prospect of the good time&#xD;
coming, and then dispersed to carry the joyful tidings&#xD;
to cheer their poor families, where hope was so nearly&#xD;
a stranger.&#xD;

&#xD;
But those efforts were found inadequate to the terrific&#xD;
evil ; although it did abate the storm, it was found in.~&#xD;
sufficient to destroy the traffic, because just so long as&#xD;
there is anything to drink, the degenerate sons of a&#xD;
fallen race will use it in some form. As long as the&#xD;
countryy is suffered to be flooded with the noisesorne&#xD;
pestikrnce, that sweeps not only at noon-day but in the&#xD;
shades of evening and in the darkness of night; man~.&#xD;
ufactures vomiting forth the very blackness of darkness&#xD;
at the rate of so many barrels an hour, and adding to its&#xD;
moral depravity a poisonous drug, that it may be more&#xD;
certain of its work, by destroying the body with the&#xD;
soul and not leave its~ poor deluded victim cursed&#xD;
above ground; only because it will add to the manufac-&#xD;
turer's gain by ,increasing the quantity of liquid poison,&#xD;
to be dealt out t&amp;amp; images made after God's own likeness,&#xD;
lest by any ir~ans they should return to God, repent,&#xD;
and livo~&#xD;
But, r~der, we would rather, oh! an untold measure&#xD;
rather, take chances with the tempted than the tempter&#xD;
in a' coming day; for heaven knows it all, and there&#xD;
will be another great record in that book. "I was hun-&#xD;
gry, and ye gave me no food; naked, and ye clothed&#xD;
m~ not; sick and in prison, and ye visited me not."&#xD;
Rumsellcr! ~hat will be thy answer?'&#xD;
How we have digressed again, we didn't intend to&#xD;
say all this, just here; but somehow it happened to&#xD;
come first, and lest it might be lost, or left out alto-&#xD;
gether, we thought best to put it in just where it occur-&#xD;
red, and so shall have to beg another apology; but&#xD;
that doesn't disturb us iw the least, we 'like a spirit of&#xD;
&#xD;
humility, for we have read of a haughty spirit before a&#xD;
fall.&#xD;
As we are not over punctilious about sticking to any&#xD;
particular locality, but like occasionally to go off' on an&#xD;
excursion for either pleasure or profit, we will just take&#xD;
the privilege of a peep into a quiet little snuggery in a&#xD;
comfortable mansion, located in an out village in what&#xD;
the Eastern world would call, the West, Where we find&#xD;
our old friend; Susie Greyllayburn, sitting so demurely&#xD;
and housekeepingly beside a work table, with work in&#xD;
band, but not, apparently, as intent on her work as she&#xD;
is on a most spirited conversation, that she is just now&#xD;
carrying on with AIf Rayburn and Mark Grey, hus-&#xD;
band and brother, you know, over the great temperance&#xD;
victory.&#xD;
Susie is perfectly enthusiastic in her rejoicing over&#xD;
the anticipated good in prospect; and her bright eyes&#xD;
twinkle and dance just ~as they used to, and there is the&#xD;
same smile of easy grace sitting round the corners of&#xD;
the mouth, and the countenance has the sarne~sparkling&#xD;
joyousness in its expression, and the hair is still hang-&#xD;
ing in curls around the face. But, if we mistake not,&#xD;
there is a slight shade of disappointment resting on the&#xD;
sweet face, for Alf and Mark are both opposing the&#xD;
measure. So we will hear what they are saying.&#xD;
"Well," says Rayburn, "I'll tell you my opinion of&#xD;
the new angled notion: In the first place, I don't think&#xD;
we have any use ~for such a law. If men want to drink&#xD;
and make beasts ~of themselves, they certainly ought to&#xD;
have the free, uncontrolled right to do so. If we&#xD;
had n't the right to dispose of ourselves and our own&#xD;

individual acts, what rights have we? What's the use&#xD;
of boasting of our free country, with legally enacted&#xD;
laws to govern us in what we shall eat or drink? It's&#xD;
worse than despotism, a great sight. I fear we are all&#xD;
getting wise, above that which is written. It's perfect&#xD;
humbuggery, and nothing else; gotten up for political&#xD;
capital, no mistake about it. And the women are head&#xD;
and ears into the business., just as if They had received&#xD;
a commission to govern. the~ world. The next petition,&#xD;
I am expecting tosee, will be a petition from the ladies&#xD;
-bless. their. honors !~..asking very I humbly that the&#xD;
abominable practice of chewing tobacco be abolished -&#xD;
and Ithen cigars will go next."&#xD;
"Well, Alt;" said Mark, "when that comes we'll~&#xD;
bring in a. twin sister, in a form of a petition to abolish&#xD;
the drinking of tea and coffee, and: taking snuff. Won't&#xD;
we have them, then?"&#xD;
"Oh I yes ~ but I'd be perfectly willing to give up&#xD;
tea and eoWee~ and snufF, too, if it would only have the&#xD;
effect to destroy all the drinking in the land," said&#xD;
Susie.&#xD;
"Now, listen Mark! Is n't she growing just exactly&#xD;
like Cousin Nora?"&#xD;
"I do believe she is; though you know she took les-&#xD;
sons a goodly number of years. We might anticipate&#xD;
some results from so long a tuition, unless she were a&#xD;
very dull student."&#xD;
"Indeed, gentlemen, I cady wish I was one-half as&#xD;
able an advocate of the cause as Nora is; and was&#xD;
possessed of only a tithe of her talents and persevering&#xD;
energy."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I can tell you one thing, Mrs. Rayburn," and Aif&#xD;
looked vastly consequential, "you'll never have your&#xD;
husband in leading strings, as Mrs. Morley has hers,. I&#xD;
can tell you that. You'll never get your husband to go&#xD;
chantingg round, spouting and gassing over the country&#xD;
about temperance, just because his wife thinks getting&#xD;
drunk is the worst thing. in the whole catalogue of&#xD;
crime"&#xD;
"But, Alf, there. is some excuse for Nora, if she is a'&#xD;
little ultra, a little extra enthusiastic, on that subject;"&#xD;
said Susie, apologetically; "she. has felt the smart;&#xD;
and, besides, she promised her mother, on her death-&#xD;
bed, to use her whole influence against the entire&#xD;
traffic."&#xD;
"What of all that? Fred necd n't make a fool of&#xD;
himself on that account," said Rayburn, impatiently.&#xD;
"I'd let her gass away as much as she saw proper; but&#xD;
then I wouldn't make myself appear ridiculous for all&#xD;
those weighty reasons, I'm thinking."&#xD;
"Oh!" said Mar14 "Susie did n't begin right for&#xD;
that- she did n't begin before marriage, like Nora did~&#xD;
That's the time, in my opinion, to fasten a fellow- be~&#xD;
fore hand, when they don't like to refuse. I've often&#xD;
wondered why the girls don't take more advantage of&#xD;
their influence before marriage than they do; they&#xD;
might get a fellow to make a deal of pledges that they&#xD;
can't get so easily made afterwaiff."&#xD;
"I guess Susie would have found that she had n't&#xD;
Fred Morley to deal with. It would n't have answered&#xD;
a very good purpose for any girl to have tried any suck&#xD;
project with me: they would have~ found themselves&#xD;

mistaken in the man, or Pm much mistaken. If a girl&#xD;
would* once jilt me, I'd live and die an old bachelor ten&#xD;
times over, before I'd go whining back a second time to&#xD;
sue for favor-and I told Fred so."&#xD;
"And well would it have been for one poor heart if it&#xD;
had been so. Oh! I never tried you," said Susie, ~mP&#xD;
hug but not one of her old smiles, it only went half&#xD;
way down now.&#xD;
Why was it? Well, why? A very critical observer&#xD;
might ~have marked a change in the personal exterior&#xD;
of the bridegroom of but two short years. ile is not&#xD;
much older in appearance, but there is a look of sterner&#xD;
purpose, marked by a. slight line of selfishness, and a&#xD;
something amounting almost to sensuality, in the face&#xD;
that is growing, evidently, more full and a~ little more&#xD;
llorid, too-with a kind of "I don't care" expression&#xD;
that is altogether a new development in the physical&#xD;
programme. Taking the entire expression of the really&#xD;
intelligent countenance, there is no marked improvement.&#xD;
The trio seemed deeply interested in the discussion be&#xD;
fore them..&#xD;
Rayburn said, for his part, he "took conservative&#xD;
ground on the whole subject of temperance; which, you&#xD;
know, is only another name for a moderate oppose of&#xD;
the whole entei'prise. I don't believe," continued he,&#xD;
"that the new law is constitutional; and I believe the&#xD;
whole thing will be entirely quashed in less than a year.&#xD;
Just let Judge Long get one blaze at it, and the thing&#xD;
will be understood at once."     I&#xD;
"I do hope it will not!" said Susie, with more than&#xD;
her wanted animation.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And I do hope it will, if it's not constitutional. We&#xD;
ought to adhere to the constitution, at all hazards. For&#xD;
if we once trample on that, in one matter~, there is nothing&#xD;
to prevent it in another, until we will find ourselves with~&#xD;
out any safeguards to our liberties, and will beliable to&#xD;
shipwreck on every rock of discord."&#xD;
"But," said Mark; with a careless indifference, "you&#xD;
don't understand the ladies, Aif I They think we have&#xD;
too many liberties, is the trouble I They don't want us&#xD;
to have the liberty of taking a social glass, occasionally!&#xD;
Guess it's because we 're sell~sh! and never insist on&#xD;
their helping us; that's all. But, for my part, I don't&#xD;
care three blue beans for the whole law. Pd take a&#xD;
glass of brandy just as soon now as I would before. I&#xD;
never have thought a little spirits did any man any&#xD;
harm, if it is n't used in excess; and no man that cares&#xD;
anything for himself will do that. I believe I think as&#xD;
little of a drunkard as any other individual need think,&#xD;
Mrs. Rayburn not excepted. Neither do I believe in&#xD;
'straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel,' in any&#xD;
matter of life."&#xD;
"Don't you know, Mark, my brother 1" and there is&#xD;
a small hand laid on his shoulder, and the gefttle voice&#xD;
has a slight tremor in it, "don't you know the first glass&#xD;
is the fatal one, it is said 7"&#xD;
"Oh! I know there are a great many things said that&#xD;
I am not just bound to be governed by - because, you&#xD;
know, I don't just altogether believe in them."&#xD;
"Older heads than your's have, you know, my brother;&#xD;

&#xD;
commences with the social glass; if there was no social&#xD;
glass there would be fewer drunkards."&#xD;
"I don't believe, IRayburn, that Morley can boast of&#xD;
any more eloquent temperance lectures than you can,&#xD;
after all! Just listen how pat she has all the hackneyed&#xD;
arguments! Social glass, and all !"&#xD;
"Oh! I was busy taking notes, sir; and was just&#xD;
weighing a little business transaction in my mind as to&#xD;
the chances of success, ~&#xD;
"Let 's hear what it is," said Grey..-.laughing so lighb&#xD;
heartedly as if danger could not come nigh his habita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I was thinking of starting out on a grand lecturing&#xD;
tour Mrs. iRayburn and myself! Let her lecture in&#xD;
favor of her peculiar views, 'Prohibition,' 'No more&#xD;
Drink,' and all that sort of thing; and then let me fob&#xD;
low, with my views of an occasional 'Social Glass,' and&#xD;
a 'Little Wine for the Stomach's sake,' and th~ many&#xD;
infirmities of 7poor human nature, and see which will be&#xD;
the most successful in procuring signatures to their&#xD;
pledge."&#xD;
"Capital, sir! Ifancy that willbe a most capital cx-&#xD;
periinent, and; besides, a fair test' of .popular sentiment6&#xD;
Now7 you see, thefools are making a great glorification.&#xD;
over this wonderful dernonstratb~n of the popular will,&#xD;
as it is said to be. And I don't believe, if there was a&#xD;
fair vote taken, oft the whole voting.' population to-day,&#xD;
throughout the State, that every third man would be&#xD;
found in favor of this prohibitory law. It only passed&#xD;
because the ladies were at the head of it! And some:&#xD;
men are such ninnies they can't say 'No,' if a woman's&#xD;
&#xD;
Il&#xD;
&#xD;
name is on the list! That would n't be gallant, you&#xD;
know?~~&#xD;
"I am glad we have so much influence with the&#xD;
'Lords of Creation,"' said the persistent little girl-wife6&#xD;
"We ought to accomplish some great and important&#xD;
good, by means of such an influence.!&#xD;
"Well," said Rayburn, with considerable warmth in&#xD;
his manner, "I should be extremely sorry to see a wife&#xD;
of mine so much out of her appropriate sphere of ac-&#xD;
tion as to be seen patroliug round over the country, at-&#xD;
tending to other people's business. Home ought to be&#xD;
the sphere of woman's talents. If she attends well to&#xD;
that field of labor, and discharges well her duties there,&#xD;
she has done all that should be required of her, in my&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
"Don't believe you are a good woman's rights man,&#xD;
Rayburn," said Grey.&#xD;
"But I think I am just the right kind of a woman's&#xD;
rights man. I believe they have rights; and I want to&#xD;
see them attend to them. But I don't believe that right&#xD;
includes the right to interfere in other people's business!&#xD;
To say what men shall, and what they shall iiot, do0!&#xD;
And what they shall eat~ and what they shall drink!&#xD;
Women going to a public shop and staying till a man&#xD;
has to give up his business to get rid of them! Such&#xD;
things are perfectly ridiculous! Absurd in the extreme,&#xD;
and should not be encouraged. If I had been. in the&#xD;
place of that saloon-keeper, I would have eat my own&#xD;
head before I would have thought of submitting to such&#xD;
an unreasonable interference."&#xD;

&#xD;
of the evils of which intemperance is the author, there&#xD;
would be a more reasonable ground for objection to their&#xD;
course," said~ Susie.&#xD;
Suffer, indeed I Women are only a set of simple&#xD;
block.heads for suffering any such things. If I were a&#xD;
woman, with a drunken husband, I'd settle the business&#xD;
in short metre, by leaving the beastly sot to his own fate.&#xD;
Any man ought to be treated ~o that will so far forget&#xD;
what is due to his family as to make a brute of himself;&#xD;
for a man is no better than a brute when he is intoxica-&#xD;
ted, or drunk. U do, myself, hate a beastly drunkard,&#xD;
staggering round the street. Such an one is a stench&#xD;
in my nostrils. We ought to have a law passed to put&#xD;
every fellow in jail as soon as he is found drunk, and&#xD;
keep him there till he gets sober. That would do more&#xD;
good, in my opinion, than all the attempts to do away&#xD;
with the use of it that have ever been tried. That&#xD;
would be striking at the root of the evil....-.beginning at&#xD;
the right place-at the abuse, and not at the use. It's&#xD;
the abuse, and not the use, that does the harm. The&#xD;
simple use of the thing doesn't harm anyman."&#xD;
Well, sir, we will admit it's the abuse that does the&#xD;
great, incomprehensible mischief. But, then, where does&#xD;
the abuse commence? Is it not the social glass that&#xD;
induces the beginning of that thirst - that at last&#xD;
consumes the whole moral principle of the man's&#xD;
nature?&#xD;
IRayburn had been a candidate, on the anti-Maine Law&#xD;
~side of tht, popular question, for Congress, from the&#xD;
district in which he lived, and had been defeated on that&#xD;
platform. It was his first political defeat and his&#xD;
&#xD;
spirit was chafed over iL, He knew his opponent wa~&#xD;
in no way his equal-in point of either talent or quali-&#xD;
fication. He felt piqued, too, with the decided stand&#xD;
his gentle wife had taken in favor of a cause that he.&#xD;
knew had been the sole ground of- his ill success. And~&#xD;
so he determined to wage an open warfare against the&#xD;
whole law. Vain man I Dost thou expect to sow the&#xD;
wind and not afterwards to reap the whirlwind?&#xD;
Mark Grey was, like his mother, yielding and easily~&#xD;
influenced - either for good or for evil4 He~ was a&#xD;
young man possessed of good talents, of a fine personal&#xD;
address - easy and graceful in his manner-. affable,&#xD;
almost fascinating, in conversation-and altogether at-&#xD;
tractive in his general deportment.&#xD;
1{ayburn had imperceptibly, without being at all con-&#xD;
scious of it himself, attained a ve~ry strong influence over&#xD;
Mark's amiable nature; and now we find him taking&#xD;
sides with him against his gentle sister-she that had&#xD;
been his idol in boyhood! and his almost constant com-&#xD;
panion, as they advanced to more mature years. Ray-&#xD;
burn's was an impetuous nature-ardent and passion-&#xD;
ate, with~ strong tendency to one-sided views - that&#xD;
never saw both sides to a question! But when once&#xD;
committed oii a subject, lie went into its support with&#xD;
the whole force of his ardent nature, and waa a whole&#xD;
host in himself. Pity it was he did n't enlist hi~ en-&#xD;
ergies on the right side of the question this time.&#xD;
Wasn't it?        -&#xD;

ton is sitting in her~quiet home, beside the little crib,&#xD;
containing a little, precious, pearly jewel - with eyes&#xD;
so like Harry's used to be I No wonder, is it, if she&#xD;
does smile one of. her old, calm smiles, as the bright,&#xD;
piercing eyes are turned toward hers,, and the chubby&#xD;
hands are raised and patted together in innocent glee?&#xD;
How contented Mattie is looked! All her surround-&#xD;
ings are plain, but. so neat and comfortable. And look!&#xD;
There seems an air of plenty in that abode where pov-&#xD;
erty once reigned I Listen-! Mattie is singing,&#xD;
"Bright things can never die."&#xD;
Why is Mattie Norton singing? What makes her heart&#xD;
light enough to sing? She is just now feeling as if she&#xD;
were beside her old piano, that used to stand in her&#xD;
drawing-room in New York. She could strike its&#xD;
keys with as light fingers, and as light a heart, too, as&#xD;
~he used to in those happy years. But she doesn't re-&#xD;
pine; her heart is too light for refining, aiid too full&#xD;
of thankfulness.&#xD;
What has wrought the change? Why, Har~y is him-&#xD;
self again. The temptation was removed. And Harry&#xD;
is not one of those to stoop to subterfuges to procure&#xD;
the means of self-abasement. He only lacks the man-&#xD;
hood, the moral courage, to resist the temptation when&#xD;
it is thrown all around his pathway.&#xD;
Harry is a fine-looking man-tall, well-proportioned,&#xD;
and very attractive in his general deportment. But&#xD;
now his naturally fine, intellectual countenance, is marred&#xD;
by sensuality and indulgence, amounting almost to&#xD;
&#xD;
4-&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
grossness.- ~And his eyes ar&amp;amp; stjll ~r~l and ~swimining.&#xD;

has the offer of a pq~t rship:with an established attor-&#xD;
ney in a fine, lucrative business, who is himself a firm&#xD;
advocate of the new law; and the wife has urged an&#xD;
immediate acceptance. The quick eye of affection sees&#xD;
there will be a strengthening influence in the association.&#xD;
She has no fears for her husband's talents; she well&#xD;
knows he is not only talented,- but well educated like-&#xD;
wise - both literally and legally. He has graduated,&#xD;
first at the Virginia State Institution, and then at the&#xD;
Anapolis Law School, with honor to himself and credit&#xD;
to his professors.&#xD;
Harry Norton was not one of those students that are&#xD;
graduated by means of money -or influence. When he&#xD;
commenced a study he made a thorough work of it; it&#xD;
was his motto, "th~t what ever is worth doing, was&#xD;
worth doing well." And, as with many other individ-&#xD;
nals, the elements of good he possessed, when they were&#xD;
debased by the demon of destruction~ made him only a&#xD;
far worse character~ - because vice had- more strings on&#xD;
which to play.&#xD;
But now Mattie's prayers are answered; and her&#xD;
husband is clothed, and in his right mind. Oh -&#xD;
happiness! Thou maiden of celestial birth I Where&#xD;
should be thy abode if it be not in the family circle?-.&#xD;

Rising, she walked two or three paces to whert Nora&#xD;
was sitting. Extending her hand, she said, "I'm going&#xD;
to see Eddie dear, he's at school I" and seating herself&#xD;
beside Nora, she looked contented for a few moments,&#xD;
and then, as if h4~r mind reverted to some great calamity&#xD;
that she could scarce comprehend, she said, starting up&#xD;
in cvide..nt alarm: ~' They s~y they murdered Eddie ~&#xD;

Our father was a resident of New Orleans, possessed~&#xD;
of an ample fortune, and an influence that gave his&#xD;
children a ready admittance into the best circles of&#xD;
society, in that city of taste atid refinement.&#xD;
* To say that Esta Was a favorite in society, is to use&#xD;
an expression that scarbel~r comprehends the extent of&#xD;
her influence. She was idolized by a large circle of&#xD;
admiring friends, among' whom she moved, a bright,&#xD;

Lovers knelt, with sincere' adoration, at the shrine of&#xD;
her fascinations, but her heart was still untouched.- But&#xD;
my sister was no coquette; only'she- could not give a&#xD;
return of affection to any of the many s~uitors that her&#xD;
beauty not more than her ~uniability and gentle manners&#xD;
called around her, and many turned away with disap..&#xD;
pointed hopes to pay adoration to other hearts of far&#xD;
less sincerity.&#xD;
But my gentle sister's affections were' not to be thus&#xD;
left so entirely uninterested. In the* winter of -her&#xD;
eighteenth year a gentleman was introduced into society&#xD;
in 'our city, from the Northern States, by the name of&#xD;
Campbell. Ernest Campbell was in every respect&#xD;

able stranger acquaintance. Such was Ernest Campbell&#xD;
when I first knew him. Rumor said he was a Northern&#xD;
adventurer, and the gentlemen were not a little piqued&#xD;
with his popularity in society.&#xD;
But Campbell said his health had been seriously im-&#xD;
paired by too long and too intense application to his&#xD;
studies, and he had been recommended by a medical a&amp;amp;&#xD;
viser to go South to recruit-to try the effects of the&#xD;
balmy breezes of the sunny climes of' the orange and&#xD;
the magnolia on an enervated system. And he. spent&#xD;
the winter in our society, winning the esteem and confi-&#xD;
dence of all who made his acquaintance.&#xD;
But when he returned to his Northern home, it&#xD;
was as the betrothed of Esta Langley. And he was&#xD;
accompanied by our brother, whom he had invited&#xD;
to visit his home in the North. Henry Langley was&#xD;
no less pleased with the cloud-capped hills, and pines,&#xD;
and firs, and clustering roses of Can~pbell's home,&#xD;
than he had been with Henry's sunny southern home.&#xD;
And when henry returned, late in the autumn, it was&#xD;
as the accepted lover of Clara Campbell. So, you see,&#xD;
the families were. to be united by a double marriage.&#xD;
How delighted poor Esta was with this second union of&#xD;
the families, and with the glowing description brother&#xD;
Henry gave of the beautiful Northern country, and of&#xD;
his new acquaintances that were so soon to be more than&#xD;
acquaiz4ances.&#xD;
Ernest Campbell came, too, to claim his Southern&#xD;
bride; i~ t~hexi I3sta Langley gave her hand to her&#xD;
ratheru ~~ii'itor, it was not with her, heart in it, for he&#xD;
*as in possession of that long sinQe. I never saw a&#xD;
&#xD;
K -'&#xD;

* gayer bridal party than was that evening assembled in&#xD;
my father's princely mansion. And wine. flowed among&#xD;
the guests as free as water. And why not? My fa-.&#xD;
ther's cellars groaned under, the weight of barrels and&#xD;
deniijohns, gud long rows ~of bottles, carefully stored&#xD;
away, that had not seen the light of day for many ~long&#xD;
years, but, were brought forth that evening to regale the&#xD;
guests, and that the newly made son might appreciate&#xD;
the real flavor of a southern nabob's wine.&#xD;
I shall never forget the look of mingled pride and re~&#xD;
serve with which Ernest Campbell said, when .pressed to&#xD;
drink only a glass of wine, "Thank you-.-I never&#xD;
drink F" But my father said, "Poh, man! it's only&#xD;
wine !" But Campbell said proudly, "I am pledged,&#xD;
sir." "Oh!" my father continued, "you Northerners&#xD;
are such fanatics! you never do any thing in modera-&#xD;
tion. Whatever you undertake, you have such a ten~&#xD;
dency to run off into fanaticism -.-a kind of predisposi-&#xD;
tion to ultraism! Who but a Northern ultraist would&#xD;
think of such an idea as pledging himself not to drink&#xD;
the pure juice of the. grape? Why, sir, there's no&#xD;
more ha2rm in that glass of wine, than, there was in that&#xD;
cup of coffee you took this morning for your breakfast,.'&#xD;
Perhaps, though, you are pledged against coffee, too ?"&#xD;
said my father, ironically. At this open irony I thought&#xD;
Campbell winced a little and half extended, his' hand to&#xD;
take the goblet that was' still held toward him! But,&#xD;
somehow, I felt o~n inward desire that he should resist,&#xD;
and maintain his integrity unswervingly n 't tell&#xD;
why though, for I had always been accu&#xD;

always had Champagne for' dinner parties, and Port and&#xD;
Macleira for evening parties. Custom had rendered it&#xD;
a ~kind of~ necessity, in the' general preparation in my&#xD;
mind. But somehow I looked on Campbell as different&#xD;
from Southern gentlemen..-..he wash' so mnch more re-&#xD;
serv~ed and strictly moral, never had drank, or played&#xD;
even for amusement, or attended places 'of general&#xD;
amuse~nent,~exeept where they were eithe~litrn~ary or' very&#xD;
strictly moral, and he was s~ very punctilious in his at-&#xD;
tendance at church regularly at every service on the Sab-&#xD;
bath, so much so that fashionable gentlemen called him&#xD;
L Northern Puritan.&#xD;
'My father, with his usual pertinacity, did not give up&#xD;
his point until he. had accomplished his purpose, and&#xD;
seen 'his new 'son; a~ he familiarly called him~ tip his&#xD;
glass and drain it 'to the dregs; 'and then he shook his&#xD;
hand playfully, ~nd 'patted hi~ shoulder, saying he was&#xD;
worthy~of his bride.&#xD;
But there was something in the 'manner of drinking&#xD;
that glass of wine whi&amp;amp;h startled me. He drank it off&#xD;
without once taking the glass from his lips.~-..like one&#xD;
that was athiret-as if he had tasted before. But dear&#xD;
1~sta only laughed a long joyous laugh, and said she&#xD;
could drink wine with 'him.&#xD;
Ernest 'said the Northern ladies were all pledged&#xD;
agah~st its u~e.&#xD;
Esta said she would 'learn them better. She 'd learn&#xD;
them there~ was no more harm in an innocent 'glass of&#xD;
Sl~ ~ aga~ than there was in a dish of the famous&#xD;
ee a ed beans. At least, Southern ladies did n't&#xD;
&#xD;
And the blue eyes of the angels looked deep down&#xD;
into that young heart, with tears of sympathy over the&#xD;
innocent tempter. That evening, when Ernest Camp-&#xD;
bell retired to rest,. his pillow pressed a cheek flushed&#xD;
with inward excitement,' and his eye was not so caIrn and&#xD;
steady as was its wont.&#xD;
Deplorable it is, the future must have so much fore-&#xD;
shadowing-that such dark clouds will drop~ over the&#xD;
fairest sunshine!&#xD;
When Esta took a farewell of her sunny Southern&#xD;
home, it was with a glad, happy heart, though the tears&#xD;
did blind her eyes. She said, answering back and&#xD;
smiling through her tears, "Oh, father, mother, sister,&#xD;
you '11 all come soon."&#xD;
And when the spring came, brother Henry went&#xD;
again to the North, to claim his bride. And he brought&#xD;
back ~word of our dear Esta's happiness in her new&#xD;
home. As letters came, they breathed only of an entire&#xD;
content with the new, beautiful country, and of so much&#xD;
unalloyed happiness in her new relation. Ernest was&#xD;
so good, and kind, and so noble! With Esta, he was&#xD;
always, "My noble husband!" All, that seemed want..&#xD;
ing to complete her measure of perfect bliss was, that&#xD;
her friends should come and make their home in the&#xD;
country of her adoption.&#xD;
And now, after two years of so much happiness,~Esto~&#xD;
was rejoiced by the birth of ~a beautiful boy-the re-&#xD;
flected image of his noble father, as Esta's letter said,&#xD;
except his eyes, and they were his mother' ame&#xD;

pled cheek of Eddie Campbell; for, with a gallant&#xD;
deference, Ernest had insisted on having this, the first-&#xD;
born, christened for Esta's father.&#xD;
When I first saw Eddie, he was a little merry prattler&#xD;
of but one short summer, the pride of both parents, and&#xD;
the most beautiful creature I ever beheld. His image&#xD;
is lithographed upon my memory, at this day; just as I&#xD;
beheld him at that first interview9 And he was so joy-&#xD;
ous a little creature, he made a happy sunlight in that&#xD;
household, with his innocent, graceful prattle. And&#xD;
Esta and Ernest looked~ into the sweet face of 'their&#xD;
beautiful boy, and wondered if sorrow could darken their&#xD;
dwelling with the sunlight of such an angel presence.&#xD;
And the long golden curls, that dropped like a bright&#xD;
eh~ud about the fair child's face, as he looked wistfully&#xD;
up to return their happy smiles of loving tenderness,&#xD;
seemed half angelic, to those happy, thankful hearts.&#xD;
Eddie was the household pet, &amp;amp;r, as Fanny Forrester&#xD;
would say,' "the household baby.~~ He was such a sweet,&#xD;
gra~eful'creature, every body loved him. For his heart&#xD;
was so full of love, and his clear, swimming eyes re-&#xD;
~realed it. Such was Eddie C4mpbell's infantile years,&#xD;
full of loving trust and innocent return.&#xD;
But, when I again visited Esta, some three years&#xD;
later, what a marked change I was doomed to witness&#xD;
in the 'parents of the happy child!&#xD;
Ernest had, I subsequently learned, been somewhat&#xD;
addicted 'to drinking to excess, to fits of inebriety when&#xD;
a s college, and his friends had strong fears for&#xD;
is~ future prospects. But, by a very great exertion,&#xD;
they s~xe~eeded in inducing hun 'to join a society, 'or&#xD;
&#xD;
secret organization, just then originating; the object of&#xD;
which was, the~ suppression of intemperance, under the&#xD;
very beautiful and significant title of "Sons of Temper-&#xD;
ance."&#xD;
With this strong safeguard, Campbell succeeded in con-&#xD;
quering the ruinous habit and, stepping ~u~t on thethe.&#xD;
atre of life, a very pattern of sobriety and orderly deport-&#xD;
2ment, he bid fair to spend a life of usefulness and honor&#xD;
entirely free from the withering curse of the soul-de-&#xD;
stroying practice of intemperance.. When-he went south,&#xD;
his friends had -strong fears of the influence which south-&#xD;
ern society might exert on his too yielding nature; but&#xD;
when he returned with his principles pure and' unstained,&#xD;
there was rejoicing over his unshrinking firmness, and&#xD;
his brethren of the society gave him an additional ad-&#xD;
vancement, and they, too, felt an inward joy that his&#xD;
principles were so firm and ~?nyield~ng.&#xD;
Alas! why is it, that they who would be good and&#xD;
pure, must be' met by temptatkm at every turn in the&#xD;
pathway of life ?~ if the victoryy is 'gained, it must be&#xD;
by resisting, with 'rio time to relax the hold on the vant-&#xD;
age ground, - lest th&amp;amp; arch 'enemy; ever on the alert,&#xD;
should open a broadside from' an unexpected quarter.&#xD;
How could Ernest 'Carnpb&amp;amp;il even so much as antici..&#xD;

fleeting hour, by 'his side; handle, ~Who should have felt&#xD;

good society. II have since learned all this in the sad&#xD;
school of bitter experience.&#xD;
When Campbell returned with his blooming bride, he&#xD;
brought back an awakened thirst for the wine-cup -a&#xD;
thirst that was never again quenched, until it was&#xD;
quenched in the blood of its victim!&#xD;
As I said, when I returned, there was a change. Esta&#xD;
looked as if secret care was preying on her system, and&#xD;
a corroding grief consuming her youthful bloom; her&#xD;
cheek had lost its freshness-..-- no roses bloomed there&#xD;
now; and there were lines of care and sorrow, settling&#xD;
round the sweet mouth, and marring the chiseled polish&#xD;
of the open brow, that I had always thought so partic-&#xD;
ular~-a beauty in Esta's fine, ingenuous countenance.&#xD;
And Campbell! what shall I say of him? The change&#xD;
was so marked! I have, perhaps, said. he was hand-&#xD;
some! But now there were unmistakable evidences&#xD;
that he was indulging in sensual gratifications. The&#xD;
manly beauty of the face was so~ marred, showing an&#xD;
unwanted fullness of the finely chiseled proportions -&#xD;
the eyelids were thk~kened and protruding, and the eyes&#xD;
had lost much of their wanted brilliance; and the lips&#xD;
and cheeks showed a tendency to bloating, which, alto.&#xD;
gather, gave the face a sensual expression, foreign to&#xD;
the open, manly look of Ernest Campbell, as I had&#xD;
first known him.&#xD;
I soon ascertained that he was indulging, to a very&#xD;
dangerous extent, in the use of intoxicating beverages,&#xD;
and spent~ most of his evenings from home, frequently&#xD;
not returning until sometime during the following day.&#xD;
Poor Esta I at such times she never suffered herself&#xD;
&#xD;
to lie ;down, but would watch all night with a ceaseless&#xD;
vigil. When Ernest did return, he was always entirely&#xD;
sober, with no signs of dissipation, only his nerves would&#xD;
seem unstrung, and he would be paler than usual; and&#xD;
there would be such a marked tenderness in his manner&#xD;
toward his poor, suffering wife, and his innocent boy,&#xD;
as if his conscience was not quite at rest.&#xD;
But my poor sister was now always pale as a lilly;&#xD;
but still she would strive so hard to smile on him, just&#xD;
as she used to when the warm sunlight of happiness&#xD;
looked into her heart.&#xD;
Then the tempted one would break off, and seem, oh!&#xD;
so very penitent! and once he pledged himself again to&#xD;
drink no more; but this time his resolution was inade-&#xD;
quate to the trial, and he agaiiryielded, and turned, with&#xD;
a renewed energy, to the fatal cup.&#xD;
Oh! how my sister grieved in secret, over her hus-&#xD;
band's sad infatuation! But still she never reproved&#xD;
him, or abated one iota of her wanted offices of affec-&#xD;
tion; but was the same kind, affectionate, loving wife,&#xD;
that she had ever been, endeavoring by every means in&#xD;
her power to win h~m back, if possible, to the paths of&#xD;
rectitude and virtue. But the inordinate thii'st, which&#xD;
was consuming him, was now too strong for his weak-&#xD;
ened powers of inward resistance, unless the temptation&#xD;
could have been removed entirely from his pathway.&#xD;
And Campbell turned from his weeping wife and prat-&#xD;
tling boy-they who had once been his pride and joy~&#xD;
and the sunlight of his heart in sober hours to min-&#xD;
gle in scenes of Bacchanalian revelry. One night, when.&#xD;
he had been drinking all day with some boon coinpan.&#xD;

ions~ and every moral energy was steeped in utter de.&#xD;
basement-when his manhood's: vigor was paralyzed,&#xD;
and sunk in the corrupting malaria and poisoned effiuvia&#xD;
of the drunkard's favorite potation a dispute arose&#xD;
between himself ~and another victim~ to the rumseiler's&#xD;
traffic by the name of Blakely (Frank. Blakely was&#xD;
an old schoolmate of Campbell's,, who had started with&#xD;
fair prospects in early life; but,. alas! the tempter had&#xD;
decoyed him, ere he had reached the meridian ~of life..&#xD;
The worm of the still had. wounded him, and, like other&#xD;
victims of the insatiate monster, the wounding had s~&#xD;
infatuated the. victim, that he only turned to his destroyer&#xD;
to be again wounded with five-fold more severity.) The&#xD;
dispute had grown out of an arguiaent on the compara-&#xD;
tive merit of northern and southern ladies. Blakely&#xD;
said something highly derogatory tQ the merits of south-&#xD;
ern ladies, and that reflected pretty strongly on the&#xD;
standing of Campbell's wife.. Campbell became perfectly&#xD;
infuriated with rage in a moment. Seizing a wine bottle,&#xD;
which they had just emptied of its contents, he dashed&#xD;
it with all his strength, now increased, too, by passion,&#xD;
into the face of his antagonist. The blow was aimed&#xD;
too. surely, and took effect on the right temple of Blake~&#xD;
ly's head, shivering the brain in an instant, lie rolled&#xD;
heavily on the floor; his hands dropping powerless by&#xD;
his side-and all that was once the hope and joy of fond&#xD;
parents, lay a weltering corpse! -&#xD;
Stanley, a young brother4n-law of Blakely'swho had&#xD;
been a' witness of the whole scene, soon as he saw the&#xD;
glazed eye and stiffened limbs of the dying man, rushed&#xD;
up, with a. demon-like fury, while Campbell stoQd almost&#xD;
&#xD;
petrified with horror at the thought of the act he had&#xD;
committed in a moment of anger, induced by a state of&#xD;
inebriety, drew a dagger from his sleev% and, before the&#xD;
by-standers were aware of his movements, buriedit to&#xD;
the hilt in the heart of Ernest Campbell! Drawing the&#xD;
deadly weapon from the wound, still reeking with the&#xD;
warm blood of his victim, he was about to plunge it a&#xD;
second time into the side of the dying man, to make his&#xD;
work doubly sure, where, alas! death was but too fatally&#xD;
doing his work already; but the murderofls weapon was&#xD;
stayed, ere it reached its destined aim!&#xD;
But, alas! for the tempted one! The bridal wine-&#xD;
cup had been his destruction! And he, whG had once&#xD;
quenched the fiery appetite-had once broken the allur-&#xD;
ing chain.-.-.had, at last, fallen a prey to the fiery demon&#xD;
of man's sure destroyer, leaving his wife a widow; while&#xD;
yet in the dew of her youth, and his darling boy,&#xD;
fatherless!&#xD;
The angels turned away from that sickening sight,&#xD;
and valued their faces, lest their gushing sympathies&#xD;
should be too strongly excited. it was a sight to freeze&#xD;
the life's blood which was not all adamant!&#xD;
Two manly forms lay struggling with the king of&#xD;
terrors, whom, but for the tempting beverage, might&#xD;
have been useful and ornamental members of society,&#xD;
surrounded by happy friends and prosperous circum-&#xD;
stances.&#xD;
When a friend went to convey the sad news of the&#xD;
fearful tragedy to the poor, bereaved wife, he found her&#xD;
still up, although it was far advanced in the night, pa-&#xD;
tiently awaiting the return of her heart's idol. When&#xD;

she was told of her new affliction, and had fully rea-&#xD;
lized that hope was at an end, reason reeled to its cen-&#xD;
tre. They who bore the mangled corpse, although men&#xD;
who were accustomed to scenes of bitterness and woe,&#xD;
shrunk back at the sight of such terrible suffering. It&#xD;
seemed as if existence would go out and life would leave&#xD;
its citadel with that heart struggle. When she beheJd&#xD;
the mangled form of him who was the adored of her&#xD;
young imagination, with a wailing shudder, followed by&#xD;
one long scr~~i of horror, she fell prostrate over that&#xD;
beloved form; straining him to her bosom as if vainly&#xD;
imagining she could impart life and animation to those&#xD;
stiffened features that had settled into the stillness of&#xD;
the grave, ere it reached her tender embrace.&#xD;
On the face of her murdered husband, her eyes were&#xD;
all the while fired, with a kind of fascination. But she&#xD;
never spake.-her agony was too strong for words.&#xD;
And when they attempted to force her away from her&#xD;
dead, by gentle means, ~she yielded, and suffered herself&#xD;
to be led away like one in a stupor, seeming almost, un-&#xD;
conscious of what was transpiring around her.&#xD;
When they questioned her of the arrangements for&#xD;
the funeral ceremony, she only said, "Oh! don't; I&#xD;
must see him. Oh! don't take him away! don't take&#xD;
him away, now! II can't bear it! Dear me'! don't take&#xD;
him away U Eddie will have no pa! Oh! we can't&#xD;
live without him !" There seemed such an obscurity&#xD;
of intellect, that when they had to carry out her dead,&#xD;
she too went, not seeming to comprehend the full, extent&#xD;
of her loss.&#xD;
But the mental shock had been too much for Esta&#xD;

and was soon her constant care.. With what an intense,&#xD;
yearning love, amounting almost to idolatry, did she&#xD;
now regard him, the only remaining solace of her deso-&#xD;
late heart!&#xD;
How tender and watchful was her love, filling up,&#xD;
in the measure of its almost extravagant exuberance, in&#xD;
some good degree, for his deep deprivation. He was&#xD;
ever at her side yielding such a willing obedience to&#xD;
her every desire and wish, her constant companion-.-and&#xD;
she his only counselor and friend. Well did he repay&#xD;
all her anxiety aird care. As her beclouded reason is&#xD;
still assuring itself, he was so good before he went to&#xD;
college! His instincts were all so pure, and his princi-&#xD;
ples so noble and honorable! They seemed a depend-&#xD;
ent safeguard.&#xD;
At the age of fifteen, I think I never saw a youth of&#xD;
more hopeful promise than Eddie Campbell was. His&#xD;
mind had been trained by a mother possessed of refined&#xD;

&#xD;
and elevated principles. And he did not even seem to&#xD;
desire other companionship than his widowed mother.&#xD;
And she,. what a happy, heart-loving task it was&#xD;
to keep him ever by her side, watch the gradual&#xD;
unfolding of his active mind, as Nature ,unfolded its&#xD;
sublime capabilities, and fitting him for the ~responsi-&#xD;
bl~, arduous duties of a life of usefulness and honor!&#xD;
What mother could but love, with her heart's sincere&#xD;
devotion, an only child! And he so beautiful, and&#xD;
protid-spi~tited, and affectionate! 'He seemed in some&#xD;
degree to supply the place of .her murdered one ~to&#xD;
save the bereaved heart from hopeless, utter desolation!&#xD;
But the time had arrived when Eddie must leave his&#xD;
mother's side, and mingle in sterner scenes, to come in&#xD;
contact with baser elements. His thoughts must go be-&#xD;
yond home and his' mother's holy influence! ile could&#xD;
not always be shielded thus b~r her angel presence!&#xD;
Dearly as they loved each other, and firmly woven as&#xD;
was the chain that bound them, Eddie must be prepared&#xD;
to struggle manfully; honorably, in the great worldwhere,&#xD;
in a few years, he was to be a busy actor and worker.&#xD;
And hardly did my sister struggle with the sense of&#xD;
duty that impelled her to the sacrifice. Her woman's&#xD;
instinct, made more acute by the lavish of her affection,&#xD;
made her tremble with a fearful apprehension and anxi~~&#xD;
ety, in view of the innumerable temptations that she&#xD;
was so sensitively aware would surround his pathway&#xD;
when exposed to the alluring temptations of college&#xD;
life. But the partial mother trusted in the correct prin-&#xD;
ciples she believed1her darling son in possession of, and&#xD;
Eddie weiit"ft~om the paternal roof with 'ardent hopes&#xD;
~nd high ~is~ations.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first year of absence there was little change per-&#xD;
ceptible in the noble, manly boy. When the vacation&#xD;
came, he hurried to his anxious mother with so tender a&#xD;
solicitude, that she felt her fears had all been ground-&#xD;
less.-her gentle boy was still pure and uncontaminated!&#xD;
A second came, and the watchful, jealous eye of the&#xD;
mother fancied she perceived a recklessness and way-&#xD;
wardness of will which startled her! But she hoped it&#xD;
was only the passing from yielding boyhood to a higher&#xD;
maturity-with the change of society to that of a sterner&#xD;
order. But when with his mother, he was like himself&#xD;
again-the same gentle, childlike nature - and his mo~&#xD;
ther trusted he would be always thus.&#xD;
But rumor said he w~s a wayward boy at school-full&#xD;
of impulses and passion, and, at times, so very impa-&#xD;
tient of restraint. When the fourth year of his studies&#xD;
drew to ,a close, he did not come home as usual, soon as&#xD;
he was free of restraint~ but went with a wild, reckless&#xD;
youth to spend the vacation in a distant part of the&#xD;
State, not even writing h~s mother word until he was&#xD;
gone. It was so little like Eddie Campbell! and was a&#xD;
most bitter disappointment to ~his fond mother! * She&#xD;
had lived during the~ long, dreary months of his absence&#xD;
on the bright anticipation of his annual visit ~honie,&#xD;
during the time of vacation! Must she wait now a&#xD;
whole long year, impatiently numbering the sluggish&#xD;
months till his return, and not once gaze on his dear&#xD;
familiar face, or hear his fine musical voice, now growi~&#xD;
so much like his pa's had been!&#xD;
But, while my poor sister was still striving to school&#xD;
her feelings to endure this~ to her, afflictive disappoint-&#xD;

&#xD;
hent, the, dreadful tidings reached us that Eddie was&#xD;
indeed drowned I&#xD;
Hi&amp;amp; companion and himself had gone out for a sail,&#xD;
on a be~utifiil sheet of water in the neighborhood&#xD;
where they were then visiting. The afternoon was a&#xD;
calm, cloudless one, without wind or storm, but the boat&#xD;
was found capsized a few hours afterwards, with no clue&#xD;
whatever to the fate of its occupants! Nor was it ever&#xD;
obtained, or any of the particulars of their untimely&#xD;
end,.~ excepting that, after searching for several days,&#xD;
ti~eir swollen and disfigured bodies were found, some&#xD;
miles from the scene of the melancholy disaster.&#xD;
For weeks the hearbrending tidings were kept from&#xD;
his unhappy, desolate parent. But she must be told!&#xD;
And I myself was commissioned to break the news of&#xD;
the sad affliction, that we all feared would either sever&#xD;
the silver chord that bound her to a wretched existence,&#xD;
or entirely darken the sky of her mental vision. But&#xD;
never, while the warm blood courses through my veins,&#xD;
do I want to execute another such commission!&#xD;
The recollections of that scene are impressed upon&#xD;
the tablets of my soul-.--.a picture never to be erased,&#xD;
while memory holds her dominion, or earthly scenes&#xD;
have one ray of distinctness! 'Tis engravedn as with a&#xD;
pen of steel! I had tried to prepare her mind in some&#xD;
degree for the afflictive recital, and did imagine her fears&#xD;
were somewhat alarmed that the news would not&#xD;
come altogether unlocked for. But oh! that cry of&#xD;
wild, unearthly anguish !-.it seemed an avalanche of&#xD;
woe, uttered from the deeps of an agonizing heart!&#xD;
It was as if humanity could not endure all its weight&#xD;
of woe!&#xD;
&#xD;
I never had witnessed such agony in any human being.&#xD;
It was as if the struggle would sunder soul and body,&#xD;
leaving the poor 'suffering heart powerless to ~itker half&#xD;
the woe that. was fast crushing out its very iife'~~1pod!&#xD;
It was a fearful baptismal of affliction!&#xD;
At length words found utterance. And ~he said, oh!&#xD;
so sadly! "My Eddie!.-Oh!'xny poor Eddie!-My&#xD;
precious boy! Oh I how can I ever live without him!&#xD;
- Oh! how can I live all alone Oh! all alone I"&#xD;
It was more than Nature could sustain. A brain&#xD;
fever followed, and we watched beside the weary suffe ~&#xD;
for long months without one ray of hope, feeling that&#xD;
life were scarce a blessing with such a burthen of misery&#xD;
to bear~&#xD;
But the Master had something still for poor, afflicted&#xD;
Esta to do, or suffer. Slowly, almost imperceptibly at&#xD;
first, the ~sufferer began to~ exhibit signs 6f recovery.&#xD;
Then the blood coursed so slowly through the sluggish&#xD;
veins, existence was struggling between life and death.&#xD;
Gently the hand of affliction was removed from the feeble&#xD;
body.~ But the mind was left. just as you witnessed it4&#xD;
Years have rolled into the ocean of the Past since&#xD;
these startling scenes have transpired, but still she re-&#xD;
mains the 'same! Seeming, at some times, to have dliii&#xD;
foreshadowing of the fearful event; then, as if suddenly&#xD;
recollecting herself, she says a~suringfy, just as you&#xD;
heard her, "Eddie 's not dead; is he? He 's gone to&#xD;
college; is n't he, dear?" But she never talks on any&#xD;
other subject for a half-hour at a time, and never appears&#xD;
to have her mind off of her own bereavements. She is&#xD;
constantly hunting Eddie, and inquiring of every one&#xD;

untimely f~te.&#xD;
It was said, when Eddie and his classmate started on&#xD;
their sailing excursion, they had a Champagne bottle in&#xD;
company. And busy Rumor said further, that they&#xD;
had both come near being expelled from school, for in-&#xD;
dul:ging in the same ruinous beverage. And these cir-&#xD;
cumstances, summed up together, give ground for a very&#xD;
~tr~g inference that there was a reason for their sad&#xD;
mishap. We had sedulously avoided the slightest inth&#xD;
motion of these startling facts to his already too deeply&#xD;
afflicted mother. But one of those ever-busy meddlers&#xD;
that are to be found in almost every society, carried&#xD;
the news to the bewildered one, relating every distress-&#xD;
ing partb~ular, to add, if possible, to the bitter cup of&#xD;
her affliction, after she had already drained ft to its very&#xD;
dregs. Ever since those fearful disclosures, Esta Camp~&#xD;

CHAPTI~R XX.&#xD;
THE CONSUMMATION.&#xD;
Time has been stealing on apace, and rolling into the&#xD;
great ocean of eternity. "White winters and rosy&#xD;
summers-full half a score. of them-have cast anchor&#xD;
on the shore of the past," since we have looked in on&#xD;
our amiable little friend Susie. Year on year has pass-&#xD;
ed, and each,~ as is the custom with years, has left a&#xD;
token-" a great one with the great, and a simpler one&#xD;
with the lowly." But we find our Susie the same grace-&#xD;
ful little sprite of a thing she used to be long years ago,&#xD;
and presiding over her household with the same easy&#xD;
grace. But there is a shade of anxious melancholy&#xD;
settling on her joyous face that we never noted there be-&#xD;
fore; and she ~seems to have been growing old faster&#xD;
than the years will warrant; for on a close ~scrutiny we&#xD;
find lines marked upon the polished brow that must, be&#xD;
of care, and her feattires have a sharpness that her years&#xD;
would not give. And then there is an expression of&#xD;
the mouth that marks anxiety, and that never accompa-&#xD;
nies a mind entirely at ease. Why. is it all so~? $~e&#xD;
has two as rosy little pledges of affection as ever bls~d&#xD;
a mother's arms, that have come to gladden her he~&#xD;
since we last locked upon her home. 2&#xD;
"Little Mark "- a beautiful boy of five summers&#xD;
the reflected image of his father, only the chestnut curls&#xD;
and winning smile of his mother. But he is "a manly&#xD;
little fellow," as Uncle Mark says, "and pretty nearly&#xD;

&#xD;
a finished gentleman already." And then "little Nora!"&#xD;
A very cherub! Looking almost like a rosebud!&#xD;
With May-blue eyes; and sunny hair clustering in wavy&#xD;
curls-with smiles dimpling all over her round face,&#xD;
and sparkling in her eyes -with long, brown eye-lashes&#xD;
resting so bewitchingly on the rosy cheeks, she looks the&#xD;
very image of what Susie has once been.&#xD;
Small wonder AIf and Susie think them perfection's&#xD;
self! Two priceless jewels! Child-angels, with such&#xD;
winning ways; so lovely almost like the white-&#xD;
winged ones above. So sweet and graceful, they seem~&#xD;
ed to be exhaled, like dew, from the hearts of flowers;&#xD;
at least so they seemed to their fond, doting girl-&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
But will their feet come up, through life's brightest&#xD;
sunshine, all the way to man or woman-hood? Or will&#xD;
darkening shadows drop over their sunshine like rain-&#xD;
clouds in a bright day? Man knoweth not! 'Tis hid-&#xD;
den with the angels, up where the white throne is set on&#xD;
high.&#xD;
But why do tears fall from Susie's eyes on to&#xD;
the golden head that is nestling close to her beating&#xD;
heart, all unconscious of the pearly drops that fall and&#xD;
lodge in the golden curls? The mother's heart is sad;&#xD;
she is thinking of the bright past, and' looking, almost&#xD;
prophetically, to the future. There had been so&#xD;
much of perfect bliss in the first years of her wedded&#xD;
life; and she had been so indulgently reared. Well&#xD;
might Susie's eyes overflow with a gush of tender sym-&#xD;
pathy as she looked on that fair bud of promise-~- a gift&#xD;
sent from heaven, and entrusted to her care, to train for&#xD;
the bright abode above.&#xD;
&#xD;
And Rayburn, what of him? Has his past; years,&#xD;
since the sunlight, of wedded happiness has shed its&#xD;
coruscations of hope round his pathway, been always&#xD;
blessed with a ray of sunlight in his heart, and sweet&#xD;
home dreams for a pillow? flag happiness, unalloyed,&#xD;
been his portion during all those years that have been&#xD;
going to be numbered with the things that were, joining&#xD;
the years of the past? We trow not. For that coun-&#xD;
tenance is singularly changed. There are now two deep&#xD;
perpendicular lines strongly defined on the fine, open&#xD;
brow; round the compressed lips lines of caret or time,&#xD;
or disappointment, are reaching half-way down the&#xD;
chin, blending, too, with a slightly troubled, uneasy ex-&#xD;
pression, as if the mind was ill at rest. And there is&#xD;
ah unnatural flush, amounting to fldrid, on the face that&#xD;
used to be pale, and almost thoughtful at times. And&#xD;
his face has been growing broader, and fuller, and&#xD;
rounder, with such a sensual look-verging to gross-&#xD;
ness!&#xD;
So we find things at present with our old friends.&#xD;
But now we had better go back and take a review of&#xD;
these past years.&#xD;
When last we were with them, AIf had just been de-&#xD;
feated in a political campaign. The prohibitory liquor&#xD;
law had just been passed, and Rayburn was opposing&#xD;
the measure most bitterly, together with the party with&#xD;
which he'was identified. And Mark Grey went with the&#xD;
tide through the influence of Rayburn. But Susie re-&#xD;
joiced from the very depths of her feelings over the ap.&#xD;
parent success of the heaven-favored measure, although&#xD;
she had forborne to give it any aid personally, from&#xD;
14*&#xD;

&#xD;
reasons into which we had better not pry too closely at&#xD;
the present, we think.&#xD;
Rayburn had said when the law first c~rne into opera-&#xD;
tion, that Judge Long could soon up-trip the whole con-&#xD;
cern. Even our esteemed friend Uncle Grey thought&#xD;
it not constitutional. And time proved 2Rayburn no&#xD;
false' prophet. For the happy results its friends had so&#xD;
enthusiastically anticipated had only began to be felt,&#xD;
before its enemies were busy endeavoring to pick flaws,&#xD;
that at last resulted in the entire abolition of the whole&#xD;
law.&#xD;
A case was brought up before the ve~ry redoubtable&#xD;
Judge Long, who ought to have been confined to his room&#xD;
all that week by a fit of gout, or pleurisy7 or agI~e, or some&#xD;
other of the catalogue of diseases to which human nature&#xD;
has an heirship, that his business mantle might have&#xD;
fallen on more patriotic shoulders; for we doubt amaz-&#xD;
ingly,'if there could have been found another heart within&#xD;
the limits of the judiciary sufficiently lost to every obli-&#xD;
gation of humanity as to thus disappoint the fond hopes&#xD;
of so many sorrowing wives afid broken-hearted parents,&#xD;
who were rejoicing in the bright prospect of a better&#xD;
time, for loved ones that had been thought past all hope&#xD;
from any other source.&#xD;
But Judge Long, whose poor, pusillanimous soul&#xD;
would have banished his own father to the ice-bergs of&#xD;
Nova Zembla, if he had been at all convinced it could&#xD;
in any way advance his own political interests, had been&#xD;
steeped in the fumes of champagne until every spark of&#xD;
pure, manly spirit, or tenderness, or even human sympa-&#xD;
thy, had been, dried out by the unnatural fires that were&#xD;
&#xD;
burning and consuming his better nature, both soul and&#xD;
body.&#xD;
Well, the case came up before his judgeship; but wO&#xD;
are not advised as to the exact number of glasses that&#xD;
dignitary, entrusted with the great boon of freedom, laW&#xD;
and justice, had taken for the purpose of clearing head.&#xD;
and heart before making the important decision that the&#xD;
entire prohibitorylaw was unconstitutional. Oh! what&#xD;
is man, when clothed with a little brief authority I&#xD;
And again the rainbow visions of hope, and the faith-&#xD;
ful labors of the many friends of the great benevolent&#xD;
act were all trailing in the dust of disappointment, and&#xD;
the rum-seller was once more protected in his lawful at&#xD;
tempt to sow the seeds of ruin, degradation and death&#xD;
broad-cast through the land! To get unholy gain to&#xD;
himself by making wives widows and children orphans-.-.&#xD;
making homes desolate, and filling poor-houses, and&#xD;
jails, and penitentiaries! , Sending souls unprepared&#xD;
into the presence of a judge of, too pure eyes to behold&#xD;
sin with the least degree Qf allowance!&#xD;
As we have before said, Rayburn had been a most&#xD;
bitter opposed of the whole measure from the getting up&#xD;
of the petitions to the closing scene; and he rejoiced&#xD;
over its final overthrow. Again he had been a candidate&#xD;
for Congress, and, this time was successful: riding into&#xD;
office on the liquor question by an overwhelming ma-&#xD;
jority. ~ut the time he had &amp;amp;pent at Washington had&#xD;
been no advantage to him, in a moral point of view.&#xD;
Very many men, of the best talents he had met there,&#xD;
were in the daily habit of indulging in a social glass;&#xD;
and wine suppers were of nightly occurrence. Biiy~&#xD;

&#xD;
burn went with the tide of evil doers. His quick tab&#xD;
ent, ready wit, and enthusiastic temperament, soon drew&#xD;
around him a circle of kindred spirits. When his term&#xD;
of office expired, he returned home with an appetite&#xD;
fourfold increased for the fiery licjuid, which prostrated&#xD;
and leveLs talents, energy, and every other principle and&#xD;
holy aspiration of the soul, bringing all down to a coin-&#xD;
mon level of the drunkard. But Rayburn still stood&#xD;
high in the community as a man of talents, sense and&#xD;
probity, and very high as a politician-especially with&#xD;
his own party.&#xD;
Many there were that looked on Susie almost with an&#xD;
envious eye, on account of her talented husband. But&#xD;
poor Susie knew the sandy foundation on which her&#xD;
hopes of happiness rested. With what a sinking heart&#xD;
she turned from the congralAilations of friends! lit all&#xD;
seemed to her so hollow hearted~. She knew her hus-&#xD;
band possessed generous, xiible impulses, a fine mind,&#xD;
with a principle which, when not prostrated by drink,&#xD;
would scorn an ungenerous or unmanly act, and would&#xD;
not stoop to meanness or anything degrading. How it&#xD;
did wring her heart, and force the scalding tears down&#xD;
her pale cheeks, .at the thought of his great danger;&#xD;
and, worst of all, he did not seem at all conscious of&#xD;
his position himself; still arguing that a social glass,&#xD;
taken in moderation, did not injure any man.&#xD;
Again Rayburn was returned to Congress from his&#xD;
own district; but he went this time with a determina-&#xD;
tion to keep himself aloof from all society where the&#xD;
alluring glass was the first object of interest. Seem-&#xD;
ingly, at this time, he realized that there might be some&#xD;
&#xD;
danger in a too free indulgence. He even went so far&#xD;
as to give his signature to a pledge, which did not re-&#xD;
quire a very strict abstinence, before leaving home.&#xD;
And the anxious wife felt so rejoiced.&#xD;
But resolutions, be they ever so good, are not easily~&#xD;
kept in an atmosphere where convivial parties and wine&#xD;
suppers are so frequently the order of amusement for&#xD;
so many choice spirits; where, tou, the best talent of&#xD;
the country were assembled, and so large ~ portion, at&#xD;
that time, yrine~bibbers. Men of sterner resolutions&#xD;
than Aif Rayburn have yielded to less temptation. He&#xD;
met many of the same members he had met there be-&#xD;
fore -gentlemen of fine talents and good minds, but&#xD;
sadly addicted to this leading vice of all vices.&#xD;
Washington was literally crowded with the vicious&#xD;
and voluptuous; and intemperance stalked abroad&#xD;
through every avenue of society, sitting alike in high&#xD;
as well as low places. It was a stern resolution, and a&#xD;
firm, unshrinking zeal, that could resist the manifold&#xD;
temptations which beset the pathway in that hotbed of&#xD;
fashionable allurements and follies.&#xD;
IRayburn's purposes, when he went there this time,&#xD;
were good, and, had the surroundings influence been&#xD;
good, or only a preponderance, he r~ t have kept his&#xD;
integrity, and returned a bette~ man. ut when he did&#xD;
try to maintain his purposes and adhere to his princi-&#xD;
ples, he was railed at for his want of moral courage, or&#xD;
called weak-minded for pledging away his liberty. The&#xD;
consequence was, that, before the session was half over,&#xD;
he was further gone in dissipation than he had ever be-&#xD;
fore been. But he drank nothing stronger than fer-&#xD;

&#xD;
merited liquors, and they were entirely within the limits&#xD;
of his ti~pIer's pledge; which was the very extent to&#xD;
which Rayburn could be induced to give a signature.&#xD;
He had said so much against a prohibitory law, or a&#xD;
total abstinence pledge so often sworn in his wrath&#xD;
never to support such fanatical measnres-.--that false&#xD;
pride, if no other sentiment, would have deterred him.&#xD;
He would nQt put it in the power of his enemies to say&#xD;
that he too was turning ultra, by giving up the liberty&#xD;
of rising anything as innocent in its tendency as a glass&#xD;
of fermented liquor was considered. Tie was willing&#xD;
to give up alcoholic beverages, and that was all. Often&#xD;
did Rayburn enter the House, during that session, with&#xD;
a step so unsteady, and a countenance so flushed, and&#xD;
with ~o excited a manner, that the most casual observer&#xD;
could not mistake his true condition. What a repre-&#xD;
sentative for a whole district! But it was not that his&#xD;
whole constituency were drunkards, or anti-temperance&#xD;
men, at heart: it was only the party that had elevated&#xD;
him; had espoused the rumseller!s interest on the broad&#xD;
platform of civil liberty-.~ that is, granting one man the&#xD;
privilege to amass gain by opening the broad avenues&#xD;
of temptation to the young and innocent, the weak-&#xD;
minded and unwar ; who have not the inward power of&#xD;
resistance to wit and such a resistless mass of t~?npta..&#xD;
tion; that he may get accursed gold which will canker&#xD;
in his coffers, and dry up the tender avenues of his con-&#xD;
science, leaving only a blig~~ed mass of moral putridity!&#xD;
Rayburn returned home to his kind, loving, affectionate&#xD;
family~ a far worse man than he was when he left them.&#xD;
How soon the eye of affection marked lhe change!&#xD;
&#xD;
Susie saw it all at a ~glance I She knew too well ttie&#xD;
meaning of that unwanted $Iush of the' countenance;&#xD;
the leaden expression of the eye;. the quick, nervous&#xD;
motion; and the unstrung nerves on first rising in the&#xD;
morning What a sad melancholy change the last ten&#xD;
years have wrought!&#xD;
But Rayburn's fondest day-dreams have been more&#xD;
than realized!. He has been verysuccessful as an attor4&#xD;
ney; has amassed a comfortable little fortune, and lives&#xD;
in                style in his adopted town*&#xD;
decidedly the best                    , and has&#xD;
twice been elected a member of Congress from hi~&#xD;
district.&#xD;
Is Rayburn happy, now that he has attained,. so early&#xD;
in life, so high a position in the world's estimate&#xD;
wealth, honor, influence? 'T is all this world has within&#xD;
its gift to offer! Alas! while he had been grasping&#xD;
for what this world has to give, he had, all unconscious-&#xD;
ly, been sowing to the wind, and what wonder if he does&#xD;
reap the whirlwind I&#xD;
It was a dangerous element that IRayburn, the gifted&#xD;
son Qf geniu~ was tampering with! full of quick-sands&#xD;
and shallows, and the shore, meanwhile, bristling with&#xD;
cragged rocks; which were scarcely hidden from view,&#xD;
and the syren voice of the tempter beckoning on, with&#xD;
sweet odors all the while dropping from her lips to hide&#xD;
the deformity of her fi~arful end!&#xD;
And Mark Grey! what had the eventful past been&#xD;
reading for him during all these years which have been&#xD;
joining the past? Has he been gaining golden opin~&#xD;
ions, and weaving a woof of virtue and merit for future&#xD;
filling up, which will ma~ke the meridian of life~ ~glorious&#xD;

and the end perfect peace? What has the Recording&#xD;
Angel written in the great book for future reading?&#xD;
What? Or has the accusing Spirit kept tally for these&#xD;
years that only forgiveness will blot out?&#xD;
We fear some dark clouds have dropped over the sun-&#xD;
light which should have been altogether unobscured,&#xD;
with one so gifted by nature, and who has enjoyed such&#xD;
~nquestionable advantages from earliest childhood. We&#xD;
fear Mark has yielded to the influence of iRayburn's ex-&#xD;
ample; and has gone in through the door, which an&#xD;
evil example, set by a character that he admired, not for&#xD;
the evil it exhibited, but for its shining marks of talent,&#xD;
and learning, and' eloquence, which hid the inner de-&#xD;
formity, exhibiting only the outer gilding to the eye of&#xD;
inexperience, had opened wide; and he has been travel&#xD;
ing downward in the pathway of ruin and destruction,&#xD;
all the while deeming himself secure as long as he kept&#xD;
within the limits of his bright example, for the fiery&#xD;
poison had been dimming his noble perceptions.&#xD;
All the while the wife and sister was in a state of&#xD;
anxiety and excitement. Her' woman's instinct was so&#xD;
painfully alive to all' the perils of both husband and&#xD;
brother. When she talked to Mark, in her warning&#xD;
voice, and pointed out the dangers that beset his path~&#xD;
way, he only pointed to her gifted husband, saying, he&#xD;
was only following his example, and if he could only&#xD;
reach the eminence' he (Rayburn) occupied, he would&#xD;
be a~t the acme of his wishes -the ultimatum of his&#xD;
ambition-(for, at this time, Rayburn's prospects for the&#xD;
Presidency were by no means unpretending.) So all&#xD;
Susie's warnings were treated as idle fears. She did&#xD;
&#xD;
once hfnt her apprehensions for her brother to her father,&#xD;
but he only said he would charge Rayburn to' be more&#xD;
strict with Mark-and then Susie' could not tell her&#xD;
fears any further. What loving wife could ?&#xD;
Mark's declensions were becoming perfectly notorious.&#xD;
He had seVeral times of late been perfectly drunk, and&#xD;
Rayburn had reproved him in no very :measured terms.&#xD;
But such reproof only served to exasperate the young&#xD;
man. lie was now a partner with Rayburn in business,&#xD;
and claimed the privilege of choosing his own course of&#xD;
conduct, and did n't just relish being reproved so very&#xD;
sharply by the individual whose influence' had first led&#xD;
him from the path of rectitude, and who he was aware&#xD;
was in the daily habit of' far more indulgence than he&#xD;
was ever guilty of, even in his times of greatest'excess.&#xD;
Had Rayburn's example been removed, Susie's influence&#xD;
would long since have induced Mark to become athor-&#xD;
ough temperance advocate, and to have pledged him-&#xD;
self to the pure principles of total abstinence. His&#xD;
temperament was so 'excitable that the fiery poison acted&#xD;
so quickly on the brain, that his mind was easily inflamed&#xD;
and his nervous energies 'paralyzed by the same quantity&#xD;
that would be little more than perceptible in its effects&#xD;
on the less nervous system of very many ofher men.&#xD;
The amount of Champagne that it would take to stea-&#xD;
dy Rayburn's nerves would make Grey entirely drunk,&#xD;
as the world would say. But he certainly was acquiring&#xD;
a very considerable fondness for drink, but all the while&#xD;
so~ entirely unconscious of any danger.&#xD;
Rayburn had taken an orphaned niece tb~ the 'shelter&#xD;
of his home some~\three. years 'previously. ' She was the&#xD;

only child of a favorite sister, who had died suddenly,&#xD;
bequeathing this, her only child, to the love and protec-&#xD;

'Lelia Mahon was but fifteen, when she had come to&#xD;
find a home with her relations in the West. To say&#xD;
that she was pretty, will hardly fill the measure of our&#xD;
intended description. When she first came to her&#xD;
adopted home, there was a shade of melancholy mark-&#xD;
ing her striking countenance. Her dearest earthly&#xD;
friend had been consigned to the grave, leaving her an&#xD;
orphaned one. And all were strange In her~ new home,&#xD;
and she had just bidden adieu to the home and scenes&#xD;
of childhood, to try new friends and new scenes.&#xD;
But now three years have gone to join the years be-&#xD;
yond the flood, and the shadows have all gone off from&#xD;
her sweet face, and the purity, of her fresh, happy heart&#xD;
is written on every lineament of her beautiful features.&#xD;
Her eyes, 'a clear bright hazel, with long drooping&#xD;
lashes, that rested like a silken fringe on her rosy dim-&#xD;
pled cheeks; and the brow so beautifully arched, with a&#xD;
forehead of classic mould; hair jet and glossy, added&#xD;
toa figure of sylph-like grace, completes our picture of&#xD;
Lelia Mahon at eighteen.&#xD;
From her first residence in the' family, Rayburn had&#xD;
felt an undefined dread of her interc rnrse 'with Mark&#xD;
Grey. For, sensual as he had himself become, he loved&#xD;
the gentle orphan, not only for her own sake, but for the&#xD;
sake of her who had bequeathed her to his care. And&#xD;
too well he knew the consequences of such a union.&#xD;
Mark' would 'have been his choice for his favorite niece&#xD;
before 'any ~ther; young gentleman in the circle of his&#xD;
&#xD;
acquaintance, but for his fatal appetite, that he feared&#xD;
was fast obscuring his fairest prospects; and paving the&#xD;
way for his sure desfructi~ii, with the flag-stoue~ of civil&#xD;
liberty. He had entire confldenee in Grey's talent and&#xD;
natural qualifications. His energy and application to&#xD;
business were pre~minentiy good. His prospects for&#xD;
success had been decidedly flattering. And his heart,&#xD;
too, when he had first known Rayburn and some other&#xD;
young men of the same social habits; was pure as a&#xD;
young girl's just merging to womanh~Yod. Susie had&#xD;
been his companion from the earliest childhood, and all&#xD;
his thoughts, feelings, sentiments, and principles, par-&#xD;
took strongly of the gentle nature of his society. But&#xD;
more recently he had been mingling in a social atmos-&#xD;
phere of less purity.&#xD;
But, despite all Rayburn's fears and precautions,&#xD;
there had been an attachment* growing up, all the&#xD;
while, between his really interesting brother-in-law and&#xD;
his beautiful niece. It could scarce be wondered at.&#xD;
For 'even if Mark was seen now~and then a little, the&#xD;
worse for drink, or even if he had shown a decided&#xD;
fondness for pleasure, rather than "business, Lelia could&#xD;
not look into the future with ~doubt or fear. She did&#xD;
not believe the half that was told her. 'And she be-&#xD;
lieved, as other young ladies have reasoned before liter,&#xD;
that her love was strong enough to win him from all evil&#xD;
allurements and vicious associations. -&#xD;
Rayburn had just come to a knowledge of the fact&#xD;
that Lelia had already lighted her faith to Mark Grey,&#xD;
and he felt grieved; afflicted and insulted, that his e~un~&#xD;
sels ~hould have been so entirely neglected by ~ne in&#xD;

whom he had taken so lively an interest, and felt so&#xD;
deep a concern; and he had ventured to expostulate&#xD;
with Lelia, on the impropriety and even dangerous risk&#xD;
of a union with a man of known profligacy of life and&#xD;
habits.&#xD;
But it was like strewing chaff before the wind. She&#xD;
loved Mark, and how could she harbor fears I~or the un-&#xD;
defined future? It is always thus with the young!&#xD;
The future is always strewn. with roses, and bright pro-&#xD;
mise! It is only age and experience that makes calcu-&#xD;
lation for dark clouds and coming consequences!&#xD;
If there Is any thing in this world of change that is&#xD;
perfectly chimerical, and entirely out of the common&#xD;
order of things, different from every thing else under the&#xD;
sun, and beyond human. calculation to account for, it is&#xD;
the subject, of matrimonial alliances-of pure heart af-&#xD;
fection. 'Tis a new hope arising in the heart, faint and&#xD;
timid always, as the first waking up of light in the early&#xD;
dawn; but a hope whose realization will make life fall&#xD;
and joyous; a tender, answering sympathy of heart&#xD;
answering heart ;~ a giving up of other preferences and&#xD;
admiration, of all the elements of awe and heart-wor-&#xD;
ship that have ever before been felt, or idealized, for one&#xD;
i~nage, one self, one presence, ~et there in the hidden&#xD;
rece~es of the mysterious abodes of the heart. 'Tis&#xD;
loving that other self better than all the world beside.&#xD;
'Tis giving all we have to give- the free, full fount of&#xD;
the affections- all to the keeping of another. Barter-&#xD;
ing affection for affection, and being happy only in an-&#xD;
other's joy. And that other may he, to the world's opin-.&#xD;
ions, ~all unwQrthy, or unequal; but the heart realizes its&#xD;
own answering.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some little time after Rayburn's conversation with&#xD;
his niece, he and Mark had been indulging in a convivial&#xD;
party with some companions of congenial habits, and&#xD;
had lengthened their orgies far into' the night. A dis-&#xD;
pute arose on some trifling subject between Rayburn and&#xD;
Grey. Words ran high. AIf said something very&#xD;
cutting to Mark, who retorted, saying, perhaps. he had&#xD;
better make another attempt to interfere ifl a heart af-&#xD;
fair with a young lady's engagements; but, if he did, he&#xD;
could assure him he would have his labor for his pains,&#xD;
~~which wiuld be all the reward he would be entitled to.&#xD;
"Well," said I~ayburn, "do you wish to know what&#xD;
my opi iions on that subject are? I think you are not&#xD;
worthy the confidence and affection of Lelia Mahon, or&#xD;
any lady of merit."&#xD;
"And do you know," said Mark, maddened by the&#xD;
insult, "that I don't think the opinions of a drunken&#xD;
inebriate ate worth resenting, or that insult would not&#xD;
go unpunished."&#xD;
"Call me a drunken inebriate, will you, when you are&#xD;
drunk as a madman yourself and have n't been sober for&#xD;
a week?"&#xD;
"Well, sir, if I do drink, your evil example first led&#xD;
me to the ruinous prae'~tice."&#xD;
"Lay all your sins at another man's door, will .you?~~&#xD;
and leaning over the table by which they were seated,&#xD;
Rayburn slapped Grey's ears, just as a mother would a&#xD;
wayward child.&#xD;
Mark was stung to the quick in an instant, and spring-&#xD;
ing up, made a vigorous effort, clearing the table at one&#xD;
bound, he shouted at the top of his voic~, "You 're a&#xD;

out1~age 1" and clinched iRaybnrn by the throat and com-&#xD;
menced choking him, until the big veins commenced&#xD;
swelling in his neck and-throbbing in his temples.&#xD;
Rayburn had, unperceived,, drawn a short dagger from&#xD;
a concealed sheath; arid; drawing it back, he plunged&#xD;
it in the aide of his now infuriated antagonist! then,&#xD;
quick as thought, and before the bystanders were aware&#xD;
of the~ action, he drew it out and plunged it again, to&#xD;
the very, hilt, in the heart of Mark Grey! He stag-&#xD;
gered, ~reeled; and fell back! Looking into the face of&#xD;
lLaybnrn, he said, with a faint smile, while the death&#xD;
palor was fast gathering on his brow, and th&amp;amp;!t~ht of&#xD;
the bright eye becoming dimmed, and the mysterious&#xD;
damp dews gathering on the face, the dying man said,&#xD;
"Rayburn! you have killed me! Oh! tell Lelia I&#xD;
loved her! even in death! Father! mother! Susie!&#xD;
all ! -tell them to forgive my waywardness! Oh! it&#xD;
will kill my mother! And good, kind Susie! oh, why&#xD;
did n't I listen to her warnings! It would have saved&#xD;
all! all!"&#xD;
The death-rattle was gurgling in his throat! At&#xD;
mention of killed, Rayburn was sobered in a. moment.&#xD;
Kneeling by the side of his now dying victim, he tried,&#xD;
by every possible means, to staunch the life's blood that&#xD;
was fast oozing from the~ too fatal wounds his own in-&#xD;
furiated hand had inflicted.&#xD;
"Oh, Mark! not killed! Won't you forgive me,&#xD;
Mark? Won't you? Oh! I was uiaddened by wine&#xD;
and by passion! Oh, God I has it all ended in this?&#xD;
A murderer! Oh! God, have mercy on~me! oh I have&#xD;

Oh! why did I-why did I strike you, Mark? Oh!&#xD;
why did I carry a dagger? my best fi'iend murdered,&#xD;
by my own infuriated hand! Wine made me a demon!&#xD;
Mark! forgive me ! -only say, you forgive me!"&#xD;
But, alas for Mark Grey! the dull ears were not&#xD;

CIIAPTEIL XXI.&#xD;
THE UNLOCKED FOR RETTJRN~&#xD;
The course of events will needs call us back to the&#xD;
quiet, peaceful home of Morley and Nora. And after&#xD;
the exciting scenes of the last few chapters, through which&#xD;
we have been called to pass, we cannot but welcome&#xD;
the agreeable change.&#xD;
It is a bright afternoon on the hither side of October,&#xD;
but 'tis one of those undefined days, that don't just seem&#xD;
to be identified with any particular season ud&#xD;
a little inclining to hazy. But still the sunshine looked&#xD;
with a June-like smile into a quiet; comfortable back&#xD;
parlor, furnished in neat, plain, but convenient style,&#xD;
with no ornamental furnishing, excepting a delightful&#xD;
profusion of odorous plants and late autumnal flow-&#xD;
ers, that told of refined feelings and elevated sentiments&#xD;
of the dwellers within - the very atmosphere breathing&#xD;
of. the blessing of a happy home and a contented heart.&#xD;
But the most interesting picture in the tableau is the&#xD;
half-girlish, half-matronly figure, sitting with one arm&#xD;
tenderly encircling a little miniature form, with rich,&#xD;
waving, brown curls, falling round his plump shoulders,&#xD;
and jet black eyes, looking with a pIeadi~ig earnestness of&#xD;
manner into a pair of hazel ones, that a~e looking an an-&#xD;
swer back of loving sympathy. Litth~ Willie (for so we will&#xD;
introduce our little friend to you, reader) is looking so&#xD;
much like Fred Morley, in miniature, that we might, per~&#xD;
haps, have been somewhat puzzled to solve the seeming&#xD;
&#xD;
mystery; had we not, by mere chance, overheard the lit-&#xD;
tie fellow call Nora ma, and that explains it all satisfac-&#xD;
torily.&#xD;
Willie has come in from his pa's office, and oxi~ the&#xD;
street had met a little girl with a wretchedly ragged&#xD;
dress and no shoes on her little feet; and the little&#xD;
sympathizing innocent is trying to make his ma compre~.&#xD;
hend the urgent necessities of the case.&#xD;
What a pleading ear1. 'tuess there is in the sweet&#xD;
child-face, it does so much ~'vnind us of N~ora. He&#xD;
can't be past five years old and. ~, his whole instincts&#xD;
are aroused with sympathy i~he little neglected suf~&#xD;

church, an i~Mh eso will do very well; you&#xD;
know I always wore them before pa got the new ones.&#xD;
Can't she have my blue cloak, ma? I'm sure I can do&#xD;
very well without it; won't you let me give it to her,&#xD;
ma? Poor little thing, her dress was so ragged it&#xD;
didn't cover her arms; and her little feet looked so red&#xD;
and sore. I wish she would come and get my shoes&#xD;
and cloak;" and the bright eyes were filled with brim-&#xD;
ining tears.&#xD;
There is a fountain there, deep down in Kora's heart,&#xD;
that will never be suffered t~ dry up. 'Tis the fountain&#xD;
of her enduring charity and kindness to suffering human-.&#xD;
ity; and now, though little Willie doesn't comprehend&#xD;
why his ma is so silent, and doesn't seem to care for the&#xD;
little ragged girl that has so strongly enlisted his feel-.&#xD;
ings, she is'pondering the- best ways and means to be&#xD;
ernploy~ed to search out and relieve, not only the little&#xD;
ragged girl, but to ascertain if there were not more suf&#xD;

fearing members of the same family. And her charities&#xD;
have already settled the matter that she will hunt them&#xD;
up and administer to their necessities. Nora always&#xD;
had a sober, intelligent look, and she is, perhaps, look-&#xD;
ing a little older; bi~it age sits lightly on a brow where&#xD;
the mind is at ease; and still Nora's face i~ wearing the&#xD;
same. happy, beaming smile it did of yore, the sure index&#xD;
of a pure spirit.&#xD;
Fred' Morley, her noble husband, is a gentleman in&#xD;
the fullest sense of the term, and is one of the strongest&#xD;
temperance men in the state. Lectures, too, on the&#xD;
subject, (as Bayburn onc~prophesied he would, when-&#xD;
ever he sees an opportunit~r~o advance the i ts of&#xD;
the cause.'. His business h~ increased gradually and&#xD;
steadily, until he may now be called a decidedly popular&#xD;
attorney; and he is a consistent member of a Chris-&#xD;
tian Church. He seems to be successfully harmonizing&#xD;
those two incongruous subjects, the practice of law and&#xD;
the obligations of a holy life, in his character; neither&#xD;
seems to deteriorate, for he always makes the lesser ob-&#xD;
ligation bow to the. greater, and so all harmonize and&#xD;
form a consistent character. Intoxicating beverages,&#xD;
neither alcoholic nor fermented, have ever passd his&#xD;
lips since Nora Wilmot rejected the hand with the heart&#xD;
in it of a tippler. Fred is decidedly popular as a politi~.&#xD;
cian whenever the temperance party are in the ascend-&#xD;
ant. But his principles are too firm to ever sacrifice&#xD;
one iota of his own honest convictions of right for the&#xD;
sake of office or popularity. He is now Judge Morley,&#xD;
having been appointed by the last general ~assembly, and&#xD;
gracefully does the new honor sit on one who is so mod-&#xD;
est, and yet so altogether worthy of the trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE UNLOCKED FOR RETURN.         34T&#xD;
Fred has just come in to tea, ~nd while little Willie&#xD;
has taken shelter on his pa's lap, and is very earnestly&#xD;
relating his adventure with the little ragged girl, and is&#xD;
urging on his pa the propriety of supplying th~ 4esti-&#xD;
tute one from his own wardrobe, his~ ma is assuring&#xD;
him of her willingness to administer to the little, one's&#xD;
necessities, making the bright eyes sparkle and dance&#xD;
with thankful delight. W&amp;amp; will listen to the pleasant&#xD;
converse of the happy home circle. Kora is tripping&#xD;
around, making all things comfortable for her happy&#xD;
household. Fred is looking over the evening paper,&#xD;
listening to Willie's interesting recital, and watching&#xD;
his graceful wife, the help-meet of his wedded blisg, as&#xD;
she moves around with such a quiet grace; and he is&#xD;
thinking meantime of a home without a wife in it. But&#xD;
suddenly recollecting, he said, looking up, "Nora, there&#xD;
will be a temperance lecture this evening in Centre Hall,&#xD;
advertised by a gentleman of the name of Wilmot.&#xD;
Perhaps he. may be a relative of yoi~rs, the name is the&#xD;
same."&#xD;
"Did you learn what the other name was?"&#xD;
"I did not learn farther than that the name was Wil-&#xD;
mot, and that he hails from Maine, the true land of tem-&#xD;
perance reform."&#xD;
"Then he is not likely to be of our family, I think.&#xD;
I don't really know much about the history of my&#xD;
father's family; but from what little I have been able to&#xD;
gather, I think my grandfather had no brother~ My&#xD;

died there, two emigrated to the western world, in early&#xD;

memory serves me right, I think there was a family ot~&#xD;
the same name living in the town of M-, where my&#xD;
mother died,"~ and Nora sighed as memory reverted to&#xD;
her ill-fated father.&#xD;
"You will go to the lecture, will you not, Nora ?"&#xD;
said Fred.&#xD;
"Oh, certainly; it wouldn't do to miss such a treat,&#xD;
as a lecture from the very fountain-head, the ultimatum&#xD;
of perfection in the cause."&#xD;
"if you will sanction it, I' will invite the Thcturer to&#xD;
spend the night with us."&#xD;
"Assuredly I will, it always gratifies me to assist' in&#xD;
entertaining any person you may invite to share the hos-&#xD;
pitalities of our mansion; and, besides, I shall be&#xD;
pleased to hav~e him here."&#xD;
At the usual hour the bells rang out an invitation to&#xD;
every one, both friend and foe, to come out and, as the&#xD;
advertisement said, hear what an inebriate of twelve&#xD;
years' indulging, and who had twice 'suffered with the&#xD;
drunkard's madness, had to say in favor of the temper-&#xD;
ance reform, as it was understood in the land of Maine.&#xD;
The circumstance of the speaker being a reformed&#xD;
drunkard, and coming from Maine, the birth-place .of the&#xD;
prohibitory law, was a sufficient stimulent to call forth a&#xD;
crowded hduse; and the immense hall was crowded at&#xD;
an early hour with eager and attentive listeners.&#xD;
As the speaker passed up the aisle, it was observed&#xD;
that he had a very perceptible halt in his gait, as if one&#xD;
foot was maimed, and the left arm was off entirely at the&#xD;
elbow. He was apparently a man of fifty, with lines&#xD;
deep drawn, settling in broad furrows down his checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jlis eyes were deep sunken, and his forehead, which had&#xD;
once been broad and smooth, w~s now seamed with time&#xD;
or care, and his figure was bent and stooping, appa-&#xD;
rently more with sorrow than age, and his voice sound-.&#xD;
ed deep and sepulchral..&#xD;
The ~isual preliminaries of such meetings being gone&#xD;
through with, a reverend gentleman offered up an appro-&#xD;
priate prayer, and the stranger rose with the air of one&#xD;
long accustomed to such scenes. With a scarce peroepti..&#xD;
ble bow, the old man said:&#xD;
"Fellow-morteis and travelers to the bar of that Judge&#xD;
who readeth every purpose, and knoweth every secret&#xD;
desire of the heart, I rise this evening before you the&#xD;
wreck of what was once a man, created in the image of&#xD;
hi8 Maker, in the image of the everlasting God. But&#xD;
it is of what marred that image that we come here to-&#xD;

oming for the grave with such a rapid progress, but not&#xD;
more from the effects of age than from sorrow and dis-&#xD;
appiutment, was black as the wing of the raven. This&#xD;
form, so bent and marred in all its proportions, by abuse&#xD;
and exp'osur~, was erect and manly. And these eyes,&#xD;
sunken and lusterless, shone with the light of intellect.&#xD;
And this heart, that now beats with sorrow and regret,&#xD;
mourning over the follies a~id crimes of the past, once&#xD;
beat with joy and affection for a loving, affectionate wife,&#xD;
with pride and hope for noble children. Yes,, stranger&#xD;
friends, I was once a happy husband! But this heart&#xD;
has long been widowed; was once a hopeful father, but&#xD;
all my household treasures sleep with the clods of the&#xD;

"But there was a cause for all this sorrow; and that&#xD;
cause rested in the fact that man, in his eager desire to&#xD;
amass a shining, glittering thing, that will turn to worm-&#xD;
wood and gall the noblest impulses of ~his nature, will&#xD;
continue to manufacture, all regardless of the direful&#xD;
consequences to his fellow man, a destructive poison,&#xD;
unlike every thing else in its tendency. Other poisons&#xD;
only destroy the body, but this liquid fire burns up soul&#xD;
as well as body; it kills beyond the grave. The Divine&#xD;

this lamentable evil - all can see for themselves; but&#xD;
it was that we may suggest some means, or some meas-&#xD;
ures, for remedy for these manifold afflictions.&#xD;
"I have come here from the far-off land of Maine,&#xD;
where temperance has achieved more signal victories&#xD;
than any spot on which the genial light of the sun sheds&#xD;
his beam. Man walks abroad there in his native strength,&#xD;
untempted and untried. Because there the tempter is&#xD;
shorn of his trophies by the majesty of the law. When&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I went there, guided by an unseen power, I was a drunk-&#xD;
ard. From respectability and affluence, I had plunged&#xD;
into degradation and poverty. Oh! I was a fanatic,&#xD;
and madly following the malign light which had led me&#xD;
to ruin! But that air was too pure for the drunkard's&#xD;
breath. Man had said in his wisdom: ~ We will&#xD;
no longer suffer the young and inexperienced to be&#xD;
tempted by the accursed demon of the bowl.' My&#xD;
friends, it is the only hope banish it forever, break&#xD;
down the strong-holds of the enemy and drive him from&#xD;
the land.&#xD;
"For ten long, lonely years I have traveled almost&#xD;
without ceasing, for the avowed purpose of aiding in&#xD;
the great business of ridding the country, this fair and&#xD;
beautiful land, stretching from Maine to Florida, and&#xD;
from the blue waters of the Atlantic to the placid streams&#xD;
of the Pacific, from this monster evil, this source of all&#xD;
crime and misery, this father of sin, this moral pesti-&#xD;

compared with the crime of creating and pouring upon&#xD;
mankind this desolating stream of moral death, this cata-&#xD;
ract of liquid fire, to blast the rising glories of our&#xD;
country, and desolate the land.&#xD;
"Time was, my friends, when it would have~been deem-&#xD;
ed a chimerical suggestion, that there was even a possi-&#xD;
bility of banishing this evil from the land -a time when&#xD;
the moderate use of ardent spirits was deemed essential&#xD;
to the necessities of the human system. But a new, a&#xD;
glorious light has arisen a light that I would might&#xD;
shihe all over the broad expanse of the whole habitable&#xD;
globe, and be written, as with the finger of God, in glar-&#xD;
ing capitals of living light, in characters of unutterable&#xD;
brightness, upon the margin of the heavens, that all&#xD;
men 'might read the joyful tidings, that it is not only&#xD;
possible, but a tried and proven fact, beyond dispute&#xD;
and beyond comment, that the poisonous liquid does not&#xD;
possess one essential element to the human system;&#xD;
that even in a medicinal point of view, (and I speak&#xD;
advisedly friends, for I have tested these matters during&#xD;
a fifteen years' practice, and can sincerely say I never&#xD;
met one single case where its place could not have been&#xD;
supplied by other ~remedies,) it is not essential, even&#xD;
when used in the greatestL possible moderation. Why&#xD;
then, oh! why curse. the land with that that is only a&#xD;
curse, and that continually, and under every possible&#xD;
circumstance?&#xD;
"No one can longer plead ignorance with the broad,&#xD;
unblemished' light that is now shining all over the land,&#xD;
on the subject of temperance. No one can longer deny&#xD;
that from this source (the manufacture and traffic of this&#xD;
&#xD;
destructive fluid) flows a train of evils which embody&#xD;
every variety of human misery and human crime; Which&#xD;
converts the blessings of heaven into curses, and those&#xD;
of life into the tortures of disease, the madness of de-&#xD;
spair, the premature agonies of temporal and eternal&#xD;
death!&#xD;
"It is too late, I say, to deny either the criminality of&#xD;
this traffic, or the magnitude of the evils that flow from&#xD;
it. It has been written by the mandate of the Great&#xD;
All Father, "Therefore, whether ye eat or drink, or&#xD;
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." I would&#xD;
ask, Can any man lay his hand on his heart and say he&#xD;
is manufacturing this poison for the glory of God?&#xD;
What! corrupt the morals, madden the brain, and blast&#xD;
and destroy every manly feeling of the human heart,&#xD;
and pour the fiery streams of agony and despair into&#xD;
the once happy and cherished circle of domestic peace&#xD;
and love, all for the glory of God! Yes, fill our alms-&#xD;
houses, our penitentiaries, and our dungeons, with in-&#xD;
mates, for the glory of God! Suspend fathers and&#xD;
husbands, and sons and brothers, on the gallows and the&#xD;
gibbet, all for the glory of Him who. cannot behold sin&#xD;
with the least degree of allowance! Oh! it is a great&#xD;
-a mighty--an overwhelming evil, which is darkening&#xD;
the streams and polluting the fountains of society, wher-&#xD;
ever its putrefying waters are permitted to glow. The&#xD;
guilt and wretchedness flowing from it, and foll&amp;amp;wiug&#xD;
in its train, surpasses all finite conception. It palsies&#xD;
every effort for improvement, hinders the success of the&#xD;

"These are the sad, the melancholy effects, my friends.&#xD;
We, who have felt the scorpion's sting, know best the&#xD;
pain of the wound! Men can talk and reason very&#xD;
coolly about that which they have never felt; but to&#xD;
those who haTe bowed down to the yoke, and felt the&#xD;
iron enter their own souls, it is not so light a matter to&#xD;
talk of these fiery temptations with composure and self-&#xD;
control. But where is the remedy-where the hope-the&#xD;
healing balm for these bleeding, lacerated hearts? Ahi&#xD;
my friends, this is the grand ultimatum, at which we&#xD;
wish~to come. The people of Maine have done much,&#xD;
nay, more than has ever before been accomplished, to-&#xD;
ward ridding society of this moral pestilence. She has&#xD;
set an example that other States would do well to profit&#xD;
by. But, my friends, have we even there reached the&#xD;
ne plus ultra-the greatest extent-the utmost effort?&#xD;
Is there nothing beyond? Is it the summum bonum-.&#xD;
the greatest possible good-that can be accomplished&#xD;
in this reform? We wot not, but we would not dispar-&#xD;
age their efforts: they have done gloriously, have&#xD;
achieved wonders-we might almost say, miracles-in&#xD;
this greatly. needed reformation; and all, perhaps, that&#xD;
could be accomplished by a single State. But, friends,&#xD;
I believe when this reformation is accomplished in its&#xD;
magnitude, it will be by the entire suppression of the&#xD;
whole traffic; the everlasting, eternal overthrow of th~&#xD;
rumseller's trade, and in the abolition and destruction of&#xD;
&#xD;
the manufacturer's profits. It will be accomplished by&#xD;
furnishing no more fuel to feed the fires of this consum-~&#xD;
ing thirst, by an entire withdrawal of temptation." The&#xD;
speaker paused!&#xD;
"I seem to hear an answering response! And it&#xD;
cometh on this wise, with the accents of a seeming dread&#xD;
and disappointment: Can it be accomplished? Will&#xD;
we ever witness such a consummation ?~ Yes, friends,,&#xD;
my heart is full of hope! I look away yonder through&#xD;
the dim vista of coming years, and a bright vision seems&#xD;
to float before my view: it is of a people, free, prosper-&#xD;
ous and happy! 'There is a light in the evening-sky,&#xD;

new found liberty, because temptations are banished&#xD;
from the peaceful abodes of men.&#xD;
"We boast of a free country, where the will of the&#xD;

a very large majority of the citizens of this -glorious&#xD;

decidedly opposed to this traffic. All that is required&#xD;
is a concert of action, that the subject, may be so pre-&#xD;

Why not so amend it as to take the required measure&#xD;

he would be necessitated to add an additional Lx, to the&#xD;
manufacturer's neat little bill; and then it would be a&#xD;
sad omission to pass by the consumer as altogether un-&#xD;
worthy of notice, and so we would enact a law, provi-&#xD;
ding for his especial benefit, which would provide most&#xD;
beneficently for him in his imbecility and helplessness,&#xD;
by having him confined in a secure place, shut out from&#xD;
all the noise and bustle of the busy world for not less&#xD;
than three days after each known dereliction, giving him&#xD;
ample time and favorable opportunity for reflection and&#xD;

that amputation became necessary. After my recovery&#xD;
I still pursued the same direction. But on rising one&#xD;
morning, judge of my surprise, when, on inquiring for&#xD;
my morning's rotation, I was told I could not be ac-&#xD;
commodated in that manner until I got to another state.&#xD;
In astonishment, I inquired what state I was then in;&#xD;
and was answered, in the state of Maine-the land of&#xD;
no more drinking nor drunkenness.&#xD;
"I was sober then, and the thought came, almost as&#xD;
an audible whisper, now you can reform, there will be&#xD;
no temptation to resist. The joyful anticipation ran&#xD;
through my enfeebled frame like a shock of electricity.&#xD;
IL was the dawning of a new hope of light, where all&#xD;
had been dark as Ethiopian gloom.&#xD;
"But for weeks Nature had to strive for the mastery.&#xD;
Her rules had all been broken, her laws disregarded, her&#xD;
requirements unheeded, her functions outraged and&#xD;
abused I But, poor inebriate as I was, I found friends&#xD;
there, good and true, ready to take me by the hand, and&#xD;
speak words of comfort and encouragement. Slowly&#xD;
and gradually the poor, abused system regained so much&#xD;
of its wanted vigor as you now behold.&#xD;
44With returning health came the desire of a return, to&#xD;
family and friends, but there was a dread of exposure to&#xD;
temptations. But friends advised the propriety of re-&#xD;
maining where there was no exposve, and sending for&#xD;
my home idols, ~'at least for a few years, until t unnat~&#xD;
ural thirst was abated, and I could walk forth free&#xD;
man. I wrote letter after letter to my poor afflict' d&#xD;
wife, but never received one word in reply. Then I&#xD;
wrote to other friends, with no better success, until three&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;
&#xD;
years of wretched anxiety had been passed, sometimes&#xD;
almost willing in my despair to believe my family had&#xD;
cast me off, as all unworthy of confidence! But I knew&#xD;
that would not be like my Mary I Oh! it was like&#xD;
'madness to my brain! And had I possessed the mean's&#xD;
of drowning my reflections in the social glass, the temp~&#xD;
station might not then have been resisted. But, thank&#xD;
God, it was withheld, and I am still a free man.&#xD;
"Then I started to find lost treasures, at all risk.&#xD;
Butt friends, Death had been ~there before me, and had&#xD;
claimed all my treasured or~.es I - had taken them, one&#xD;
by one, to his icy embrace,~ah4PAhey were sleeping quietly,&#xD;
side by side, in the home of t~e dead. I learned it all&#xD;
by chancing to meet an indi~i~~~il that had lived in my&#xD;
native town. My wife had died of pulmonary disease~&#xD;
brought on and aggravated by grief and sorrow, and&#xD;
scarlet fever had swept off her orphans, and given them&#xD;
to the angel mother, before I reached the place where&#xD;
my home had been, and I had not the moral courage to&#xD;
go nearer! I could not look upon that home that was&#xD;
now desolate! My heart jewels were all withered!&#xD;
I felt that I Was without friends, kindred, or home!&#xD;
I could not go there, for it was not so once~n~! my&#xD;
friends, I could not go there, but I felt like flying to the&#xD;
farthest corner of Earth, and devoting my remaining~&#xD;
energies to the dissemhI~ation of those principles that&#xD;
will save my fellow-beings a fate far worse ~han&#xD;
prom&#xD;

"In my wanderings I have traveled over seven States,&#xD;
lecturing all the time in this great cause, that should&#xD;
deeply interest every citizen in this Republic, either&#xD;
male or female~ But I have never yet had the courage&#xD;
to visit the quiet village, where so many happy memories&#xD;
cluster, and where so many bitter recollections linger I&#xD;
But now my face is set thitherward, and should the&#xD;
Great Shepherd spare my poor existence another week,&#xD;
I expect to stand by the graves of my own household&#xD;
idols. 'Tis in an adjoining State, in the thriving village&#xD;

At mention of theh. ~ ~f M-.---, Fred Morley&#xD;
felt his arm more tightly awed. Looking into Nora's&#xD;
v        face, he saw it was ashy pale !~ Almost gasping for&#xD;
breath with excitement, she said, "It is my father! oh!&#xD;
I know it is my father!"&#xD;
At the wQrd father, the speaker paused, and turning&#xD;
in the direction where Mr. Morley sat, he said, "Whose&#xD;
voice said father? It was so like my Mary's ~&#xD;
But Nora, now too much excited to think of decorum,&#xD;
was making her way to the speaker. Soon as their&#xD;
eyes met, the man of sorrows said, "Oh I who are~you,&#xD;
that is so like my lost Mary?" The answering voice was&#xD;
only, "My father, it is your lost N~oraA" And father&#xD;
and daughter were clasped in each other's arms I All&#xD;
in that vast audience were melted, to tears! And the&#xD;

and tranquilize the evening of hi~ existence, shedding&#xD;

all the intei~esting but painful particulars of the death-&#xD;

tongue was heard to utter! and how, subsequently to&#xD;
her mother's death, her only brother and sister had been&#xD;
swept off, in a few short hours, by that withering scourge&#xD;
of parental hopes, the scarlet fever! And then she&#xD;
herself had gone to an adjoining State, to find a home&#xD;
and a protector, through the sheltering kindness of her&#xD;
Uncle Gre~r. Hence the incorrect information of her&#xD;
father's informant. And he, the widowed one, how&#xD;
many heart struggles, and lonely hours of utter desola-&#xD;

heartfelt thanksgivin o?&#xD;
The crushed, withered affections were again gathering&#xD;
up their drooping tendrils, to circle and cluster' around&#xD;
this lost-found treasure. It was the budding hope of&#xD;
a new-found happiness, where all had been shrouded in&#xD;
regretful despair! a joyous light in that evening sky!&#xD;
