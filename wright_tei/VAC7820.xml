I HAVE on my table a slip of paper and I read this on it&#xD;
"Please send preface to ' Ten Old Maids.'"&#xD;
Now who can truly tell the heart-preface to one old maid ?&#xD;
Men who look in the face of an unwedded woman are apt to&#xD;
think she walks alone because none of his kind wanted her for&#xD;
a life-mate ; but I believe few girls have gone far into their&#xD;
twenties without being asked to marry some masculine crea-&#xD;
ture ; I doubt not many die like the pale primroses, because&#xD;
the right one never said, "Wilt thou?"&#xD;
It is a subject of chronic marvel to me to note how men will&#xD;
often pass by the noblest, completest specimens of womanhood,&#xD;
and pick up for their having the silly, inefficient, 'vapid dolls,&#xD;
who prove to be either "spaniel fools," or 4"mule fools," and&#xD;
trammel and drag downwards their husbands from the altar to&#xD;
the coffin.&#xD;
Perhaps it is that law of life which always provides for the&#xD;
lame and the lazy which so frequently ties the helpless, useless&#xD;
female to the courageous, industrious man.&#xD;
. Dr. Johnson says, " Men know that women are an over-&#xD;
match for them, and therefore they choose the weakest or most&#xD;
ignorant."&#xD;
There are some women who never love but once, the dream&#xD;

PREFAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
of sixteen being the secret adoration of a lonely life. Some who&#xD;
are not able to love at all, having set too high their standard&#xD;
of manly excellence ; they are continually disheartened and dis-&#xD;
gusted by the little selfish meannesses, the petty inconsist-&#xD;
encies which will be visible upon even the best specimens they&#xD;
meet.&#xD;
Duty, which sets aside the rights of the soul, and devotes&#xD;
all energies and capacities to weaker and dependent ones, makes&#xD;
s me old maids; extravagance and costly living makes many,&#xD;
the best and most unselfish man not daring to pluck down&#xD;
into poverty the girl whom he finds surrounded by luxuries&#xD;
which seem to him to be her necessities.&#xD;
The folly of the five foolish is not set forth because folly&#xD;
dwells alone among the spinsters, but because the individuality&#xD;
of the spouse is so submerged in the husband that she is only a&#xD;
minus quantity during his life, and a "relict " after his death,&#xD;
never worthy the distinction of a parable.&#xD;
But whatever may be the preface of old-maidhood, all honor&#xD;
and love to the excellent and noble of the earth who are strong&#xD;
enough to make a life worth living for themselves, who will&#xD;
and do of their own good pleasure. Pity and  ympathy for&#xD;
the tried and patient ones who stoop under other people's&#xD;
burdens.&#xD;
The best motto I know of for maids and wives to live by is&#xD;
just this: "Pray and work."&#xD;

HAT a very delightful family are the Dun.&#xD;
reaths !" said Mrs. Lewellin, after she returned&#xD;
from a private admiration visit to the wedding-&#xD;
presents of the eldest daughter, who was about to commit&#xD;
matrimony. "And how admirably Clytie has managed&#xD;
the family since her mother's death,-though, to be sure,&#xD;
she has a perfect treasure in that great strong monster&#xD;
of a 'Goody Ruddock,' as they call her. Anybody could&#xD;
keep a model house with plenty of means, and such a&#xD;
servant; I'm sure I could, and not half try, Strong&#xD;
enough to manage a lunatic asylum, and forever drudg-&#xD;
mnng! Well, some are made to drudge, and some to be&#xD;

TEN OLD MAIDS&#xD;
&#xD;
dredged for. A life of ease has never been my lot, al-&#xD;
though I could wear fiumadidles and take my comfort as&#xD;
well as. anybody. Let me see: Clytie is just twenty, the&#xD;
twins are eighteen, that Oirchis is eleven and a half, and&#xD;
Candace is ten this month. I knew their mother when&#xD;
she was -a girl; I was her bridesmaid, and I've lived&#xD;
neighbor these last ten years; and I must say they are a&#xD;
most charming 'family. It is extremely fortunate that&#xD;
Mr. Danwreath is so very rich, because, after having accus-&#xD;
tomed his children to all the elegapices and luxuries of&#xD;
life, they are entirely unfitted for any coarse striuggles&#xD;
with existence; and now Olytie is going to marry&#xD;
money: so there will be no break in her future, and I&#xD;
suppose the twins will go on keeping house till they&#xD;
marry money, and so on. That is the way it goes in some&#xD;
families. I do declare things are not equal! Here my.&#xD;
oor Roger has been a book-keeper all his days, and we&#xD;
have been obliged to board ; and as fqr -our children, I'm.&#xD;
sure they'd shine if they were in the right place as well as&#xD;
those Dunwreaths. Heigho! Well, I must rip up my old&#xD;
lavender, and turn it, and try to make it do for my Susie&#xD;
to wear to the grand wedding. Poor Susie!"&#xD;
A very elegant-home had the Bunwreaths, on the broad-&#xD;
est avenue of a handsome city, where plenty had helped&#xD;
good taste, and constant use had made all the costliness&#xD;
home-like, and as essential to the comfort of the inmates&#xD;
i substantials are to poorer and less fortunate folk.&#xD;
Mr. Dunwreath was sitting in the library with his daugh-&#xD;
ter, talking of her future.&#xD;
This house, my darling, belongs to you children; I&#xD;
boght it with your mother's money; and I have invested&#xD;
Fi  balance n stocks which are as sure as any securities&#xD;
h. _ be,.and which pay well."&#xD;

&#xD;
He rose and unlocked a little ebony and walnut writing.&#xD;
desk which stood on lion's claws: a bijou of a table, ex-&#xD;
quisite in French finish. It had been the property of&#xD;
Mrs. Dunwreath, and her husband was fond of sitting at it=&#xD;
sometimes resting his chin in his hand, looking into the&#xD;
mirror in its lifted lid, and seeing there not his sad, care-,&#xD;
worn face, but a satisfying panoroma of the happy days&#xD;
he had lived with his wife, the centre-figure of all his&#xD;
memories, and sometimes, I think, a vision of himself,&#xD;
lonely, unrestful, and merely waiting for the call to&#xD;
come out of the valley and ascend into the sunlight of her&#xD;
companionship. Once she had been from home a whole&#xD;
month a little while before she died, and after his&#xD;
daughters had tried all their arts to interest and cheer&#xD;
him, they had gotten but this response: "To-morrow I&#xD;
shall see your mother."  I chronicle this fact, because I&#xD;
believe his to be a unique case, worthy to be noted. A.&#xD;
husband who had never tired of his wife!&#xD;
"Here are the vouchers, Clytie," said Mr. Dunwreath,&#xD;
pulling forth a roll of papers tied with red tape., "I&#xD;
want you to understand about them now, before you are&#xD;
the head of. another man's house. I want yotn to&#xD;
know that you are all 'provided for moderately: about&#xD;
thirty thousand apiece, which will be enough for nonsense&#xD;
money and charities, to say the least, if I should be taken&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"0 papa, don't speak of such a thing ! "&#xD;
" Why not, darling i The half of my life is beyond&#xD;
my reach, and I miss it. When you are all placed, and&#xD;
my work is well and honorably finished, I shall not be&#xD;
sorry to go. Oh no, dear, not yet! not yet ! Don't look-so&#xD;
grieved. I shall live, I dare say, to trot your children on&#xD;
myknees, though 'tis true death's thousand-doorssand&#xD;

open, and .I am as likely to stumble through one as an-&#xD;

Clytie, and I am not afraid to say that. you will be a noble&#xD;
wife. You have your mother's ways: they comfort me&#xD;
often: and you speak to me with her own sweet voice.&#xD;
I feel glad there is this competence for my children safe&#xD;
out of the business, there are so many turns in Fortune's&#xD;
heell"&#xD;
"4Are you in trouble, papa?" asked Olytie, anxiously&#xD;
studying the face she loved to see complacent. "Has&#xD;
anything happened?"&#xD;
"Nothing, my child; and yet I could feel more satis-&#xD;
fled if Collin were less fond of speculations; wild spec-&#xD;
ulations, I call them."&#xD;
"'Why do you permit them, papa?"&#xD;
"It is not easy to prevent them, dear; he is the senior&#xD;
partner, and so much older than I, and as pig-headed as&#xD;
he can be. I don't apprehend any difficulty at present,&#xD;
and I'don't know as I do.at all. There, there, darling,&#xD;
don't let trouble-clouds come over your heart or your&#xD;
pretty eyes. Now, tell me, are you satisfied to make a&#xD;
g husband of this lover? Does he fill the bill?"&#xD;
"Satisfed ? 0  papa! satisfied with  Donald  Mc-&#xD;
Queen".&#xD;
"No more words are wanting, my darling; well, God&#xD;
=bless you! I am afraid it would be hard work for me&#xD;
to find the man I could think worthy my wife's image.&#xD;
I must let her choose for herself."&#xD;
' Thank you, papa," Clytie answered, blushing a little,&#xD;
but also quite clear-eyed. "I was the heart's desire of a&#xD;
true man, and when it was revealed to me, I gave hini&#xD;
my soul to ,keep. If I can only be to him what my&#xD;
mother was to you, I.shall count my life a full. blessing."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, yes; a full blessing-that is the good truth.&#xD;
You are able to be that to any man. I wanted to have&#xD;
my talk with you ins this room; a -handsome room, is it&#xD;
not, Clytie?  You must not let strangers have any of&#xD;
these things, even when they are old and faded, and I am&#xD;
turned. to dust. I want you to keep-every shred of car-&#xD;
pet, every tag of curtain; I cannot tell how dear and&#xD;
precious they are to me; your mother and I bought them&#xD;
together ; we took a whole summer to it; we gathered&#xD;
them from distant cities; we culled them at our leisure,&#xD;
and made a pleasure-excursion of each purchase. There&#xD;
is a story to everything; a sacred memory. Yes, yes,&#xD;
that's right; thank you, dutiful child. .1I know you will&#xD;
love them for our sakes; and some day I'll tell you all&#xD;
about the good times which belong to them.. So my Cly-&#xD;
tie sees no clouds on her rosy skyi2"&#xD;
"None, papa; but if there were storms, they would&#xD;
not frighten me, while Donald loves me ; nothing would&#xD;
be too much to suffer with him or for him."&#xD;
"Yes, yes; life does look fair for you. I hope and&#xD;
trust you will be happy."&#xD;
"Papa, I shall be happy as Donald's wife."&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
I HAVE LOST MY EURYDICE.-&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh, somewhere sweet unconscious Dove,&#xD;
That sittest 'ranging golden hair,,&#xD;
And glad to find thyself so fair.&#xD;
Poor child ! that waitest for thy Love."&#xD;
&#xD;
'C&#xD;
,1&#xD;
&#xD;
YOUNG girl arrayed in her bridal robes, gazing&#xD;
at her other self in the mirror, thinks of many&#xD;
things, beside the fit of her corsage, the fall of&#xD;
the veil, the trail of the sweeping skirt, the droop of the&#xD;
orange-blossoms, or even the effect of a wedding group&#xD;
around the holy altar.&#xD;
I believe few this adorn themselves, without trepid&#xD;
dread of the life whose portal is ready to unclose for their&#xD;
entrance, and a regretful back-look over the free girl-&#xD;
hood to which they must make ready to say "adieu."&#xD;
Clytiminestra, mostly called Olytie Dunwreath, saw heir&#xD;
own face, rejoicing in its beauty-her symmetrical ele-&#xD;
gance of figure and outfit--with absolute complacency in&#xD;
its completeness: a complacency which floated all about&#xD;
her, enwrapping in its rosy clouds the man she loved with&#xD;
a love so abounding, so entire, so rich and ,sumptuous,&#xD;
that there was not a shade of doubt, -a throb of fear, or a&#xD;
di-ead of the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
Donald McQueen stood to her for faith, goodness, dd-e&#xD;
votion, truth, purity, and congregated excellence, bound&#xD;
together in a bundle of manly beauty and manly consum-&#xD;
mateness : a concord of endowments and attributes surpas-&#xD;
singly excellent, so finished as to leave nothing to be&#xD;
desired.&#xD;
Clytie was possessed .in her own soul'of a rich share of&#xD;
the good she saw in her lover. Though she was a girlof.&#xD;
sound sense and fair discernment, 't never occurred to&#xD;
her that there was a shade of possibility that the perfect-&#xD;
ness she worshipped might be a reflection of her own.&#xD;
qualities ; and if she had never put into words her esti-&#xD;
mate of Mr. Donald McQueen, she felt all this and&#xD;
more, concerning the delightful person who was without&#xD;
doubt worthy the risk she was ready to take; and to hve&#xD;
sullied the glory of being his wife by any regrets over&#xD;
her girl-life, any sadness or griefs, would hate seemed to&#xD;
her sacrilegious and abominable.&#xD;
The eve of the wedding-day had shut in its shadows,&#xD;
and it was through the radiance of gas-lights tha5t the&#xD;
bride' saw herself as we told you, in her robes of white,&#xD;
rare of fabric, elaborate of detail: beautiful, wondrously'&#xD;
beautiful.&#xD;
After awhile' she left behind her the exclamations and3&#xD;
raptures of the twins, their caressing lingers, loving&#xD;
words, fond kisses, as well as the slippings and jubilancer&#xD;
of the children over the' approaching festival, and de-&#xD;
scended to the library where she had held the business=&#xD;
talk with her father; and promised him always to ire-&#xD;
serve his beloved plenishing; 1and there he sat, thenan,&#xD;
whose wife she meant to be, and to whom 'she desired to:&#xD;
show her apparelling.&#xD;

as to be worthy aparticular description  Symmetrical in&#xD;
alU ways-in proportion, carriage, and color. Beautiful&#xD;
eyss,-the truest almond shape, soft, flashing, eloquent.&#xD;
But stay! there was a shade of strangeness just there, for&#xD;
gone of those wondrous soul-windows was a liquid blue,&#xD;
and the other the tawny hue of a lion's. You might look&#xD;
a hundred times. in this Apollo's'face, and feel always&#xD;
something magnetic in its fascination, without discerning&#xD;
the peculiarity, the brows were so clearly lined, the&#xD;
lashes so-long and curling; and when it did strike you,&#xD;
yon were apt to wonder that all faces were not thus&#xD;
F=arked because, instead of finding it a blemish, you&#xD;
feltit a grace and charm. His hair was rich chestnut-&#xD;
brown, his silky moustache and full flowing beard of the&#xD;
same glossy hue.&#xD;
Oh yes; undeniably Mr. McQueen was .a remarkably&#xD;
handsome man, and the quick, glad approach and joyous&#xD;
sunshine-flooded features which greeted Clytie's cormng,&#xD;
looked like ardent devotion, and his words were musical&#xD;
nature. Intentionally, perhaps, she went over and stood&#xD;
beneath a superb picture of herself, in those very robes,&#xD;
which hung beside her mother's counterfeit, in costly&#xD;
frame, and she smiled archly as she watched her lover's&#xD;
eyes comparing the real and the ideal.&#xD;
"Is it like me, Donald ?" said she, after a minute's&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
"Beautifully like, dearest; it lacks but breath and&#xD;
voice to round its'charm: perfect loveliness. I feel jeal-&#xD;
ots of the fellow who could mirror my Beauty for other.&#xD;
people's eyes. How intentlyhe must have studied each&#xD;

" 'Light hair '-stupid ! failing utterly to designate my&#xD;
Clytie's locks: silken thread of wondrous spinning, not&#xD;
red, not yellow; pale flax dipped in amber, and pow-&#xD;
dered with moonbeams. - ' Black eyes'-yes, black, like&#xD;

"Why, Donald! after to-morrow we shall"be always&#xD;
together."&#xD;
"To-morrow is not this evening. I wish to be happy&#xD;
to-night with my Olytie by my side."&#xD;
As she stepped away slowly up the stairs, full of the&#xD;
affluent love which was all hers-in ]ir. McQueen, her&#xD;
ears caught the sound of the piano. He was playing&#xD;
" I have lost my E3urydice&#xD;
with such roping chords and bewildering combinations&#xD;
that she paused involuntarily. After a moment's charmed,&#xD;
listening, she softly retraced her steps, as unwilling to go&#xD;
&#xD;
quite out of the reach of the melody, out of sight of the&#xD;
player ; and she came again and stood beside him while&#xD;
his fingers flitted over the keys, watching his wrapt face&#xD;
so absorbed in the harmonies he created, half unconscis&#xD;
of her presence, half inspired by its atmosphere. After&#xD;
a while he paused, and turned towards her, his eyes full&#xD;
of tears, and extending his hands to clasp hers, he m&#xD;
mured:&#xD;
"O Clytie, how I love you!"&#xD;
" Would you have looked back, Donald?9"&#xD;
"When you, my Eurydice, was following meI I think&#xD;
I could not lose sight of you even in Hades."&#xD;
"There you would have lost me."&#xD;
"No!.for I would have turned again amongst the&#xD;
shadows and have shared your fate. My Eurydice! my&#xD;

"I will not let you say the word, Olytie ; the thought is&#xD;
treason."&#xD;
" So it is, Donald. I did not think to utter it: it came&#xD;
unbidden to my lips; it lives not in my soul."&#xD;
As Olytie floated up the stairs her face smiled, and her,&#xD;
heart wondered at its own happiness.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
ROLLIN DUNWREATIH--" DANGEROUS.&#xD;
T midnight a cry arose: "Fire ! fire! " The great&#xD;
factory belonging to Dunwreath Brothers was in&#xD;
flames; but though there was a vast deal of com&#xD;
motion, there was little harm done;-but on going over&#xD;
the premises a curious thing was discovered, which set the&#xD;
whole neighborhood in a ferment. In the counting-room&#xD;
were found bunches of cotton yarn saturated with' oil,&#xD;
and pine splinters piled like cob-houses all around themn}&#xD;
and a strong smell of kerosene overcame even the smoke&#xD;
and must with which the general stir-ups filled. the air.&#xD;
Ialf a dozen trains of fuze, extending about the room,&#xD;
had kindled after all only a pile of papers and an old&#xD;
yard-stick, whose light flame the night-watchman had&#xD;
seen, and so sent out an alarmh in time to save the build-.&#xD;
ing. But'one fact was evident, the fire was the work of&#xD;
an incendiary.&#xD;
"uWho did it?"  " What for?" were the questions dis-&#xD;
cussed by knots of men, echoed by boys, and kept fly-&#xD;
ing by many mouths. A rumor of impending failure&#xD;
had been gaining ground, no one knew how, for a couple&#xD;
of days beforehand, and a rush on the house proved&#xD;
that their funds were short. Also it was found that they&#xD;

were liavil insured. Mr. Rollin Dunwreath *was last&#xD;
seen about the office; in fact, he had paid a late visit to&#xD;
his desk ah hour or more. after he had bid Olytie good-&#xD;
night, and had fetched thence a roll of papers belonging&#xD;
to his private affairs, and had locked them in the ebony&#xD;
writing-desk. The watchman had seen him fasten the&#xD;
door, had spoken to him, and had got no reply, the gen-&#xD;
tleman passing him with bent head and soft steps.&#xD;
Mark had also seen him. Mark was a new weaver hired&#xD;
by Mr. Rollin within the month; a down-looking, surly&#xD;
fellow mean in face, in person, in dress ; his very legs&#xD;
looked mean in their crookedness: they stumbled and&#xD;
shambled as if used to running in evil ways. Before -ten&#xD;
o'clock Mr. Rollin Dunwreath was arrested; the oflicers&#xD;
came to his handsome mansion and carried him-off ; a&#xD;
rabble followed their departure, hooting and howling.&#xD;
The. young ladies and the children saw it all. He kissed&#xD;
them, and left them an astonished group of innocents,-&#xD;
scarcely comprehending the rude trouble, the impossible&#xD;
event. After a short examination, in which Mark testib&#xD;
i fled to having seen him, and the night-yatchman told&#xD;
his story, the gentleman was carried to the jail; and it&#xD;
was necessary to have out a guard to convey him thither&#xD;
in safety, for the crowd of workmen and small creditors,&#xD;
setting on the rabble, so threateningly surrounded the car-&#xD;
riage, that there was danger of a riot and violence be-&#xD;
fore the law could be brought to bear on the case.,&#xD;
After it was over, and the prisoner shut in behind the&#xD;
old gray stone walls, and quiet was restored on the&#xD;
streets, Mr. Collin Dunwieath was closeted with the&#xD;
weaver Mark, who was saying his say, standing on one&#xD;
leg arid twirling his old hat, while his eyes wandered on&#xD;
either side of him on the floor, as. if he were looking for&#xD;
&#xD;
ROLLIN DUNWREATH--" DANGER0U ".&#xD;
&#xD;
. a place to drop into out of sight. On one ankle he had&#xD;
a running sore, which he kept bandaged, and he always&#xD;
tagged that foot after him as if he felt a weight pulling&#xD;
it backward.&#xD;
"I want to be off immediately, sir," said he; "I don't&#xD;
feel over safe or comfortable round here: I must- get on&#xD;
a tramp. I've come to give in my notice and get my&#xD;
pay, if you please."&#xD;
He looked in his employer's face, as he said the word&#xD;
"-pay," with an odd'glance, cunning and malevolent.&#xD;
It was a dull eye too, pale and watery, and he wiped a&#xD;
tear from the corner on an old cotton handkerchief.; and"&#xD;
he had scarcely taken away his hand when another&#xD;
gathered and dropped, and his lids were redand inflamed&#xD;
with the acrid rheum which kept collecting there.&#xD;
".Impossible, Mark !" retired Mr. Collin Dunwreath,&#xD;
ducking his chin into his loose neck-cloth witk a motion&#xD;
of irritation. "It would just fix the attention of every-&#xD;
body upon us; we are watched on all sides now." You&#xD;
must go on, with your work in the mill; there is not a&#xD;
doubt of my brother's acquittal. They've got no eviP&#xD;
dence of any account, and as soon as the trial is over&#xD;
you my be off as quickly as you please..&#xD;
" Yo  think Mr. Rollin is sure to come through&#xD;
clear?17&#xD;
Of course I do; why not?"&#xD;
"Nothing, sir; but 'soriebody_ set the fire going; any.&#xD;
body can see that ; and they'll ferret and ferret till they-&#xD;
fix on the 'cendiary, to my notion. I don't want to stop;&#xD;
I want my pay."&#xD;
"I won't give you a farthing, Mark, till next week, I&#xD;
tell you, so say no more about it; go and take your loom&#xD;
before your-absence is noticed."&#xD;

and then you ma whistle for your body. I shall concern&#xD;

Shan't you, sir? What if I should split on you: tell&#xD;
what I done, and who set me up to it; and what he&#xD;
promised me for iti That would make a heap of differ+&#xD;

"have to do in case I got into trouble, and what company&#xD;
I'd engage to bring along with me. If you pay me now&#xD;
and let me go, I ain't afeard, and I'll keep your secret,&#xD;
Mr. Dunwreath, along of my own. "But I won't stay&#xD;
here, that is the long and short of it. I ain't a-goin' to&#xD;
wait for 'em to worm round and smell me out like a  fox&#xD;
in a hole. I'm set on a tramp across country just as soon.&#xD;
'ar.. ILa get my wages.&#xD;
a    eor parner bit his nails while he peered out of&#xD;
half-shut eyes at the iean,. dogged fellow who turned his&#xD;
red eyes at him from time to time, and then dropped his*&#xD;
lids, twitching hither and thither, slouching, seeking&#xD;
something he did not find upon the floor. The tool was&#xD;
unsightly, and the gentleman, felt disgust in his neigh-&#xD;
borhood. The end of the conference came at last, and&#xD;
the weaver Mark hid away a roll of bank-notes in his&#xD;
dirty vest before he left the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
ROLLIN DUNWREATH-"DAGEROUS.&#xD;
All right, Mr. Dunwreath, sir," said he, with his hand&#xD;
on the knob; " I've kept a lot of secrets in my life, and&#xD;
I'll store away yourn among 'em. You needn't be afeard.&#xD;
You'll never see Mark no more. I hope Mr. Rollin will&#xD;
come off safe. I s'pose his interest in the mill'll be all&#xD;
square when he does."&#xD;
"What do you mean, fellow?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothmi', sir;; there's queer tales amongst the hands:&#xD;
they do say his brother is feathering his nest out of Mr.&#xD;
Rollin's share. The hands all like Mr. Rollin; he's a fine&#xD;
man to work for; he is too easy by half. I feel kinder&#xD;
sorry for him, I do. If it wasn't jest as it is, I should like&#xD;
to stay and see how he thrives. Good-day, sir; best be&#xD;
keerful about fires, hadn't you, sirl there's such a lot pf&#xD;
cotton thrums and pine sticks scattered all round. Pd&#xD;
keep a watchman, if I was you."&#xD;
Mr. Dunwreath felt a .cold shiver in all his bones as&#xD;
thelame weaver went off grinning, and turned for a last&#xD;
dlookat the "boss?': such a mean, nasty, treacherous devil&#xD;
as leered from his watery eyes; his mirth was so insulting.&#xD;
The senior partner threw up the windows and let in a&#xD;
stream of cold air, the place seemed so pervaded with&#xD;
sneaking crime, cowardly rascality. It took'a good many&#xD;
ducks of his chin into the spotless choker to make him&#xD;
feel at ease.&#xD;
Circumstantial evidence convicted Mr. Rollin Dun.&#xD;
wreath. It is astonishing how little will answer to convince&#xD;
an unbiassed jury, when their minds are made up before'&#xD;
hand. In this case it certainly looked thin, but they ac-&#xD;
cepted it. The crash and failure of the mill inflamed&#xD;
people's minds so much, that it was as necessary for then&#xD;
to have a victim as for Moloch on his high feast-day; and&#xD;
once. they fastened on this partner, public opinion never&#xD;

veered. It would have been all the jurors' lives were&#xD;
worth ;iot to convict him: they thirsted for an example&#xD;
in high life-common felony was stale, not worth running&#xD;
down.&#xD;
All this man's blameless career told against him. The&#xD;
very minister under whose preaching he had sat so many&#xD;
ears to whose comforts he had a thousand times con-&#xD;
tributed generously out of his abundance, shook his head&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"What a pity to steal the livery of the court of heaven&#xD;
to serve the devihn."&#xD;
Perhaps the good man was not wholly to blame ; Mr.&#xD;
Collin had paid him a visit, during which he had wept&#xD;
copiously, as he related his peculiar trials, and comforted&#xD;
his sad soul in the sympathy of his shepherd ; but the&#xD;
after-vis# of the minister to the family was certainly out&#xD;
of taste, as you may perhaps judge from his closing re-&#xD;
marks :&#xD;
"   u can always feel comfort, my young friends,if you&#xD;
are c ut off from an unworthy parent by his own wicked&#xD;
act, that he was an excellent provider ; and if you want&#xD;
me to come and pray with -you sometimes, send and let&#xD;
-nme know, and I'l come."&#xD;
At the trial, poor Rollin's own straightforward state..;&#xD;
ment went against him: He had been in the mill at an&#xD;
unusual hour; had removed private papers; could give no&#xD;
reason for this act which satisfied the enlightened jurors,&#xD;
as he chose not to proclaim to the curious the fact that he'i&#xD;
cairied them home, because he felt them more safe there&#xD;
than in the power of his elder brother.&#xD;
Mr. Collin went about with his head bowed like a&#xD;
bulrush. People noticed that he never smiled, and whis&#xD;
pered, " How he takes the disgrace I" At the trial he used&#xD;
&#xD;
ROLLIN DUTNWREATH-2-DANGEROS."&#xD;
up numberless handkerchiefs with his plentiful tears&#xD;
-and much sorrow was felt on his account; and curi-&#xD;
ously enough, no sooner was the affair completed-the&#xD;
prisoner disposed of--than a rumor got somehow in circu-&#xD;
lation of a good sum of money-enough, it was said, to&#xD;
beggar the already impoverished man-which had been&#xD;
offered to the jailor, to buy the felon's freedom. This the&#xD;
jailor stoutly denied; but it kindled ,a new interest in, and&#xD;
sympathy for the faithful brother who was willing to share.&#xD;
his last cent with a wicked hypocrite who had caused so&#xD;
much misery, and deserved no such treatment at his hands.&#xD;
The creditors felt the influence of the generous family-love,&#xD;
the forbearing self-denial, in this chivalric gentleman; and&#xD;
the senior partner was enabled to compound on easy&#xD;
terms, and start the works afresh, almost immediately&#xD;
after.the convict was shut behind the massive walls which&#xD;
deaden all groans, all human cries of anguish, as well&#xD;
as all human hearts outside, which might listen and pity.&#xD;
Mr. Collin had an interview with the condemned. The&#xD;
day he was removed, shaved, invested with the danvning&#xD;
stripes, shorn, of his manhood; he received the first-born&#xD;
of his mother. The jailor and keepers were within call,&#xD;
and it was as well, perhaps, that they stopped.&#xD;
"You know, Collin," said Clytie's loving father, "ou&#xD;
know.that I am not guilty of this crime. Why you desire&#xD;
to put me out of your way, I do not understand. I have&#xD;
never willingly crossed it. I believe I know who is guilty,&#xD;
but I have no proof. If I had, I should bring it forward.&#xD;
I would not perinit myself to be sacrificed, if I could help&#xD;
it. I feel the not: I am sure who cast it: but what good is&#xD;
to come of the act I cannot imagine. I want to say good-&#xD;

perate man, such a devil enters into him as is quite likely.&#xD;
to spring up with opportunity, and I might clutch a guest&#xD;
by the throat. Brotherhood wouldn't go for much there.&#xD;

before I tear your false heart from your body, and train-&#xD;
pie on it ! I have a clean soul. Get out of my sight, or I&#xD;

The sailor and keepers were as much shocked and as-&#xD;
tonished as their trade would let them be, with this unnec-&#xD;
essary outburst, and they listened to hear how the hand-&#xD;
some portly visitor in broadcloth would reply to the felon&#xD;
in stripes&amp;amp; You see, a body in rogue's' uniform has a&#xD;
rogue's soul, and the stereotyped reply to a prisoner who&#xD;
protests his innocence is, "Of course-they all say so-&#xD;
and we believe 'em." They edged a little nearer the two,&#xD;
so much curiosity did they experience.&#xD;
"I make due allowance, Rollin, poor fellow ! for your&#xD;
situation, for your rebellious state of mind. Since your sin&#xD;
has found you out, I am sorry for you. I could gladly for-&#xD;
get my own unpleasant position. It is hard to feel that I&#xD;
have a brother under sentence of law. I wish I could&#xD;
save you; but repentence would better become you than&#xD;
this strange language--this abuse of your elder-who-"&#xD;
A quick spring, a clanking of handcuffs, a heavy thud,&#xD;
and Mr. Collin Dunwreath lay sprawling on the floor: his&#xD;
spotless linen was grimed with the dust and with the&#xD;
blood which spouted from his face. A gyve makes a good&#xD;
gash in' a desperate stroke, and all the balance of his ad-&#xD;
mired life, Mr. Dunwreath carried a scar on his cheek&#xD;
from the blow dealt him by his unworthy kinsman.&#xD;
le did not court reference to it; he covered it as well&#xD;
as he could with whiskers; but it was there: and when,&#xD;
&#xD;
men did speak of it he always looked grave a'id sad --not&#xD;
stern, but sorrowful.&#xD;
He was tenderly raisedfrom his grovelling-beneath the&#xD;
blazing eyes of the convict, lifted in helpful arms, and&#xD;
well cared for.&#xD;
The prisoner was raised also: he was kicked and knocked&#xD;
on the head, and had oaths in plenty launched at him,&#xD;
and, worse than all, he had his name entered on"the&#xD;
books, with "Dangerous " tacked to it. This quiet gen-&#xD;

bodiment of all sweet gifts and tender graces, in his&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
C HE COMETH NOT, SHE SAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
ifE day of the fire, which should have been&#xD;
Clytie's wedding-day, found her alone with her&#xD;
sorrow: scarcely sorrow as yet, but astonishment,&#xD;
bewildered anxiety. After waiting through weary hours,&#xD;
for the bundle of manly beauty and manly consummate-&#xD;
ness to come with his sufficient strength to support her,&#xD;
his munificent love to console her, she sent for him at&#xD;
evening ; and, having sent, she gave the last touches .to&#xD;
the dress ,he liked so much, and which she had put on at&#xD;
his request, when she laid off her bridal robes.&#xD;
A soft clinging crape of palest azure, a shawl of filmy&#xD;
lace, which she had draped about her after his first kiss,&#xD;
and of which he had tied the knot at the waist in the back,&#xD;
passing the costly fabric over his white hand, admiring&#xD;
the clover-leaf pattern worked into its fine meshes: "Is&#xD;
it hem-stitch Olytie, this delicate thing ?"  That was&#xD;
the silly question he had asked, all unskilled in needle-&#xD;
women's phrases. She smiled to herself as she remem-.&#xD;
bered it, and how very handsome he had looked at the&#xD;
moment ; and also when he added: "Always wear such&#xD;
dresses, Clytie; it suits my darling's wondrous loveliness.&#xD;
'All rich and rare fabrics, all costly jewels must 'be&#xD;
&#xD;
hers. Truely, never saw I such eyes, such hair, such sup-&#xD;
pie stateliness ; and my nymph in blue is an angel of the&#xD;
azure."&#xD;
Ridiculous 'nonsense, of course, to outsiders, yet I know&#xD;
sensible women who listened to worse, and glowed at it, in&#xD;
their hey-day of youth and courtship. I mention this to&#xD;
excuse Clytie for the liking she cherished for the dress.&#xD;
Having been praised by the manly bundle, it became&#xD;
thenceforth sacred and precious, even to the lengths of&#xD;
ribbon which snooded her amber tresses, and the tiny&#xD;
bows which held her breast-knot.&#xD;
She stood a long time before the mirror pitying her-&#xD;
self, her father-dreading for herself and for him-not&#xD;
taking in any possibility which would doom him at last ;&#xD;
but the trouble vexation, and interruption of their lives.&#xD;
Slowly, very slowly, there drifted among her thoughts&#xD;
a dread of the wreck of her best hopes-not precisely a'&#xD;
doubt of her lover, but a dim dawning of the ideas; that it&#xD;
would be proper for her to delay her inarriage: yes, of&#xD;
course that must be----and also to offer freedom to her be-&#xD;
trothed-that did not filter into her musings till she was&#xD;
weary with waiting, and still he came not, even in an-&#xD;
swer to her message.&#xD;
A swift footfall on the pavement, a ring at the door&#xD;
bell.' He was come, he was at hand. She flitted down,&#xD;
the stairs. She met the servant, who offered her a sealed&#xD;
note ; she tore it open.&#xD;
" Gone to Europe."&#xD;
This only on the ,back of one of the manly bundle's&#xD;
visiting cards-" to be given if called for."&#xD;
It had been called for; it. had done its mission. Clytie&#xD;
.did not faint. The girl who had Waited for the effect -f&#xD;
the missive, curious of her betters, after the manner o&#xD;

<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7820-00000017"/>&#xD;
34         "HE COMETH NOT," SHE SAID.&#xD;
her kind, carried away from her mistress' presence a mem--&#xD;
ory of her eyes-such jetty blackness, such dazzling.&#xD;
light, such an instant death of womanly tenderness, such&#xD;
demon-birth asparkled from their intense depths; cold,&#xD;
pitiless, outside of all sympathy with humanity.&#xD;
Carefully folding the azure robe, the lace shawl, the&#xD;
blue ribbons, the bunch of rose-buds, she laid them away,&#xD;
and atop of all she pinned the parting gift of her adora-&#xD;
ble lover..&#xD;
"Gone to Europe."'&#xD;
Also, Clytiminestra carefully packed the bridal dress,&#xD;
orange-blossoms and gossamer veil, the elaborate trousseau,&#xD;
every article which was linked by any memory or associ-&#xD;
ation with the bridegroom; and with a turning of a key&#xD;
she locked him and her past with him out of her life. She&#xD;
never mentioned his name. If it was spoken in her pres-&#xD;
ence, she nor paled nor flushed; a marble face could, not&#xD;
be more emotionless, more set and stony.&#xD;
She neglected none of her.daily duties: she ordered the&#xD;
'household, presided at the handsome table, comforted her&#xD;
father in the jailgsat beside him in the dock,.and at-&#xD;
tended him to the prison.&#xD;
Dimly,.yet fixedly, as something belonging to that ter-&#xD;
rible trial-scene, came always afterward to her mind the&#xD;
vision of a small man-meagre, mean, sordid, in grey&#xD;
clothes-who sat crouching with his chin in his hand, away&#xD;
in a far, obscure corner. She saw him wipe his eyes on a&#xD;
dirty cotton handkerchief when her Uncle Colin wept&#xD;
aloud. He, the meagre man, was not grieved though, nor&#xD;
synpathetic, because she felt, rather than saw, a derisive&#xD;
grin on his treacherous mouth. All through that hideous&#xD;
time he was. there, in the same place, watching, waiting,&#xD;
following every motion of the elder brother, portly and&#xD;
&#xD;
"HE COMETH NOT," SHE SAID.&#xD;
personable, with the vigilance of a skulking cat, blink-&#xD;
ing at the prisoner, eyeing the judge, scanning the un-&#xD;
biassed twelve, leering at herself, gloating pver the&#xD;
whole. His lanky, faded hair, his grimy, horny knuckles,&#xD;
his discolored teeth, and scrubby beard, even the untidy&#xD;
knot of a red-silk scarf he wore twisted around-his skinny&#xD;
throat, were made especially obvious, during the pellucid&#xD;
charge of the "most just judge," by a slant ray of sun-&#xD;
shine, which glanced across him; and as long as Clytie&#xD;
lived, she was,'forced to take this wearisome wretch into'&#xD;
the terrible ordeal of that hour, with every wave of mem-&#xD;
ory which surged over her unwilling mind. She saw&#xD;
him in her dreams, coerced to turn from the sad eyes&#xD;
seeking hers for rest; the dear, fond eyes, ever loving&#xD;
even in their deepest despair, to meet those bleared, perfi-&#xD;
dious ones. When at last the dreadful trial closed, and&#xD;
the awful verdict smote her ear-the knell of doom-&#xD;
"Guiltyh": she knew that he slunk away, and his last look&#xD;
as he turned his head at the door was .upo  the two&#xD;
brothers-one a responsible citizen: the other a miserable&#xD;
outlaw, so apart from his kind that nothing cpuld ever&#xD;
set him in his lost place among hisFpeers again; no after&#xD;
act of the worshipful court, however just, however merci-&#xD;
ful, ever restore what they had taken away, ever atone&#xD;
for the disgrace they had put upon him. I have heard&#xD;
that the judge's wife, a good woman and true, was much&#xD;
troubled in her mind over this trial and its decision, and&#xD;
that she begged and prayed her husband to look into the&#xD;
evidence more closely, and that he promised her to do so:  J&#xD;
but it being the eve of a great political contest which&#xD;
promised him preferment, he disliked to raise up for&#xD;
himself  any enemies-and also his own affairs became&#xD;
suffirently engrossing-he being obliged tonight the op&#xD;

36"HE COMETH NOT," SHE SAID.&#xD;
posing candidate tooth and nail-it is not remarkable that&#xD;
the minor interest of a felon dropped into insignificance.&#xD;
As Clytie emerged from the place of infamy into the&#xD;
court-jard of the den of  criminals, with her sufferer&#xD;
leaning heavily on her slender arm for support-he who&#xD;
was about to be cut off from all love, all consolation-she&#xD;
walked 'erect, thinking only of the dear, dear father by&#xD;
her side.&#xD;
She heard one of the women--'of whom many, drawn by&#xD;
horrible curiosity, were thronging the place, gazing upon&#xD;
the victims-say to a friend:&#xD;
"Why, there are trees-here which look as if they might&#xD;
have birds on them."&#xD;
"Yes; jail-birds," replied her neighbor ; and all within&#xD;
ear-shot of- the smart joke laughed at-it. Mirth seemed&#xD;
sickeningly out of place in this haunt of sorrow and evil;&#xD;
this lawful torture-house, where men are put to be pun-&#xD;
ished, not reformed. But Clytie felt nothing they said,;&#xD;
they had no power to touch her. She had heard jests&#xD;
among the lawyers and loungers, and chuckles from the,&#xD;
judge while her gather's life hung trembling~in their legal'&#xD;
balance. All were alike indifferent- to her; even the&#xD;
comments upon her personal appearance, such as touch&#xD;
the sensibilities of women most vitally, even after grief&#xD;
has no more work to do,3ropped upon her ears un.,&#xD;
heeded.&#xD;
Mr. Dunwreath never made but one mention of his situ&#xD;
ation and prospects to his daughter, and that was while&#xD;
she sat outside on the lonely bench, waiting forhim to.&#xD;
get his ticket and call to his new hair-dresser and tailor.&#xD;
" Clytie," said he, reaching through the bars, taking her&#xD;
Eands in his and looking straight into her still' eyes,&#xD;
"Donald is gone; you are alone?'"&#xD;
&#xD;
"HE COJIETH:NOT," ShE SAID,        37&#xD;
"Alone, father-I think only of you."&#xD;
"Can you bear it all, poor child. Can you live till ]&#xD;
die?"&#xD;
" I can live, father. If I could give my life for yours,&#xD;
I would- do it-assit is, I am all yours as long as you can&#xD;
think of me."&#xD;
"One last word, Clytie-a true word: look straight into&#xD;
my eyes; let me see your full, penetrating glance upon my&#xD;
face while you speak it,-am I a guilty man to you?"&#xD;
" No, father," she answered quietly, without tears or&#xD;
change of countenance. "iNo; you are a victim: only. a&#xD;
little. ahead I see-you a martyr."&#xD;
That was just before his brother Collin came to take&#xD;
leave, and the great tears which gathered into his unwill-&#xD;
ing eyes as he watched his beautiful girl so wrecked in ier&#xD;
happiness, were still unshed, when the free, prosperous&#xD;
gentleman, magnanimously appeared -to enact the great&#xD;
and good man, in the presence of admiring witnesses.&#xD;
After the gates shut the convict in, Clytie- came con-&#xD;
stantly to the grating. Sometimes she could not get to&#xD;
see him; he was sick ; he was under arrest; or the sov-&#xD;
ereign will of the autocrats of his fate denied her because&#xD;
they had the power, and loved to make her feel its smart.&#xD;
That is human nature everywhere. "Dressed in a littl(&#xD;
brief authority," it will strut and stagger, and grindthe&#xD;
faces of the underlings. The best are quite as apt to be&#xD;
dogs when  they arrive at- the safe place, as was the Qd&#xD;
Jew who lauded his virtue, till he got the throne, and&#xD;
then bit and snarled and devoured at his leisure.&#xD;
Weaving did not amuse or interest the prisoner, who&#xD;
possessed no mechanical skill, and brought no kindliness&#xD;
twhiis enforced task. lie never broke the speaking rules;&#xD;
he never looked up at his fellows; he made no answerd&#xD;
&#xD;

" OE N S "  OETH NOT," SHE SAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
when addressed Gby his keepers ;'ie lived in gloomy si-&#xD;
lence-alone,.apart, brooding, glooming, black, "danger-&#xD;
ous." He was continually up for punishment. .Blows&#xD;
andkicks made no impression on him; starving could not&#xD;
alter his behavior. He came out of the "black hole "- (a&#xD;
private retreat where were bestowed contumacious men,&#xD;
whom it was desirable to punish; the dead were also&#xD;
kejt there, who dropped off from time, till they were&#xD;
ready for dissection, or mercifully handed over to friends.&#xD;
It was not a gay place to men ; blind-worms liked it, and&#xD;
slimy crawling things: but as the only light came through&#xD;
one brick-space, they could not be seen, only felt; one&#xD;
sense was not offended)-R--olin Dunwreath came out,&#xD;
staggering hither and thither ; cadaverous, as he should be,&#xD;
who comes from the home of corpses; holding by the wall&#xD;
for support,-or tumbling over when his limbs failed him,&#xD;
which down-fall afforded great mirth to turnkeys and&#xD;
other sub-officials-ghastlyglee in a ghastly place. But the&#xD;
trips and stumbling were the failure of the weak, mortal&#xD;
body. The hidden soul they had not touched; they never&#xD;
found it by their most racking persuasions: those gentle&#xD;
reformatory influences, which our Christian laws provide&#xD;
for the salvation of our human brothers. God do so, and&#xD;
more also, unto those cold-blo'oded torturers in their ut-&#xD;
most need!&#xD;
It took only a few months to finish off the weaver, and&#xD;
though the sovereign state failed to reap her anticipated&#xD;
profit from his bones and sinews, and the unlucky con-&#xD;
tractors were absolutely out of pocket,-his work was so&#xD;
ill-done,-yet he did not much impoverish the treasury,&#xD;
for his keeping could scarcely be counted. Cold water&#xD;
is not an expensive beverage, and cold water was his&#xD;
principal consumption; the black bread lie soaked in it,&#xD;
&#xD;
being hardly worth weighing, he took so extremely little&#xD;
of the mouldy luxury. Always a nice and dainty eater,&#xD;
he could not readily swallow!tainted meat, or the inevita-&#xD;
ble beans. They were too bind to permit him to starve,&#xD;
however, and the stomach-pump they used must have&#xD;
been an engine of mercy and benevolence.&#xD;
Finally, one day, the grandees came together to sit ii&#xD;
state and preside over the punishment of the contum&#xD;
cious wretch, who had failed in his task. Satan came&#xD;
also,-fie! what am I saying !-I mean the Prison Doctor,&#xD;
whose business it was to stop the recreation at the pre-&#xD;
cise moment before the shrinking soul refuses longer to&#xD;
share the tortures of her mortal keeper. Civilization has&#xD;
advanced that far, since Inqisition days. I don't know&#xD;
that they sanctioned the presence of a physician in the&#xD;
dungeons where they kept the racks, the thumb-screws;&#xD;
the pincers (not one of them more terrible than the crown&#xD;
which is in use in the retreats of our country). Let us&#xD;
be thankful for such a spirit of progress in our times, and&#xD;
pay willingly the salary of the M. D. who earns his&#xD;
money. The overseer had a complaint, "poor weaving."&#xD;
Everybody had a-grudge. The keeper said, he "couldn't&#xD;
help kicking the convict, he was so bad-tempered!"  ,&#xD;
at the same time, there was an old offender there, wh&#xD;
knew, the inside of all the prisons in the country, who was&#xD;
always re-committed as soon as released; who had many&#xD;
privileges. He was a great favorite; made coarse jokes,&#xD;
got off his task easy. In ancient times, one Barabbas was&#xD;
called for by men in preference to the world's Example.&#xD;
Well, it won't take many words to tell Rolin Dun-&#xD;
wreath's end. He was adjudged to the cistern, some in.&#xD;
vention of the Devil, where the victim must pump or die.&#xD;
They said, he would not pump.; perhaps he could not, for&#xD;

&#xD;
he was pretty well brought down from his royal manhood&#xD;
by this time, so that. lashes, curses, and hard knocks&#xD;
seemed scarcely to touch him. At any rate he did not&#xD;
try to hold on to existence, when the handle of a pump&#xD;
was offered him for the purpose; and they took his life-&#xD;
less body from their infernal contrivance, and putting it.&#xD;
into a rough box, sent word to his daughter, that she&#xD;
might take away the dead weaver, who had signally&#xD;
failed to be useful under their contract. This was very&#xD;
kind,. because such remains are the lawful property of&#xD;
surgeons, who cut bodies and jokes at the same time,, and&#xD;
become learned and scientific with the repulsive occupa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The head grandee attended a tragedy that same even-&#xD;
ing, and wept over the hapless fate of the beautiful hero-&#xD;
ine; and they all ate of the body and drank the blood of&#xD;
their gentle Master on the following Sabbath at the holy&#xD;
communion of saints. Nay two of them offered the sa-&#xD;
cred emblems to Christ's followers; but they had changed&#xD;
their prison clothes, and washed their hands, and most&#xD;
likely their consciences, since the murder of the weaver.&#xD;
Clytie did fetch away her father, dear and precious to&#xD;
her through all, a martyr as she had foretold. The end&#xD;
had come a little sooner than she had looked for, but she&#xD;
was almost thankful; the wicked had ceased from troub-&#xD;
ling and the weary was at rest. She washed the scarred&#xD;
and marred image,of God, so wretched in its emaciated&#xD;
wofulness that scarce any trace of his majestic father-&#xD;
hood remained, and shrouded it for the grave ; no hands&#xD;
but'hers touched it, no eyes saw its sad state; and when&#xD;
her task was finished, she sat down beside it, and gazed&#xD;
steadily and long into the wide-open eyes, which no&#xD;
friendly hand had closed after their last life-look. Who&#xD;
&#xD;
" HE COJETH NOT," SHE SAID.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
can tell what were the thoughts, the resolves of this young&#xD;
girl, so quiet, so emotionless, so pale like death ?&#xD;
People said they would not have believed Clytie Dun-&#xD;
wreath was so sharp at business. She was sharp, and she&#xD;
proved herself capable. lNr. Colin found her so, when&#xD;
she steadfastly persisted in looking over the bQoks of the&#xD;
mill. He felt it unpleasantly, when her eyes, intense in&#xD;
their vivid blackness, looked into him, while he assured&#xD;
her, that "the business had come to so bada pass before-&#xD;
before poor Rolin's-misfortune as to leave nothing, ab-&#xD;
solutely nothing for the heirs." He felt it, when she de-&#xD;
clined his offers to settle her affairs, and take care of the&#xD;
property secured to them by their mother. He felt it,&#xD;
writhed under it, when she put coldly aside his visits of&#xD;
condolence and sympathy;. refusing to recognize any kin-&#xD;
dred or ties' with him or his.&#xD;
She left her dead packed in ice, while she made a jour-&#xD;
ney alone. Returning at night, very pale but full of power,&#xD;
she dispatched it at midnight, per express, to its final rest,&#xD;
where, none of her acquaintances knew, or when; as it&#xD;
was left in a distant depot till called for, and being called&#xD;

Having settled everything,-scrupulously obeying her&#xD;
father's wishes concerning the little nook of a room, which&#xD;
he and his wife had loved so much, even to the picture of&#xD;
herself in bridal robes-she left her childhood's home&#xD;
without a sob,: making no farewells, shedding no tears,&#xD;
even when placing the last flowers\on her mother's grave;&#xD;
and the-Rolin Dunwreaths were as dead to the people of&#xD;
the town, as if they had never existed.&#xD;

GROWTH SEED AND BLOWETH MEAD.&#xD;

"Summer is a-coming in, loud sing cuckoo:,&#xD;
Groweth seed and bloweth mead, and springeth the wood anew;&#xD;
Sing cuckoo, cuckoo.&#xD;
Ewe bleateth after lamb, loweth calf after cow,&#xD;

WO adjoining farms, whose acres are counted by&#xD;
hundreds, both " landscapes with cattle," both&#xD;
beautified by running brooks, by waste places of&#xD;
wild vegetation, where Nature loves to run riot and scatter&#xD;
marvels of her handicraft of bud and blossom; but both&#xD;
under excellent cultivation, both admirably fenced, well-&#xD;
wooded and fertile. Everybody said it would be difficult&#xD;
to decide which looked most thrifty and prosperous, or&#xD;
which lay most charmingly in green meadows.and yellow&#xD;
grain-fields, or which would bring the better price in&#xD;
market.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Baiquither spread southward and bounded its neighbor&#xD;
on the north, and the great square stone house fronted the&#xD;
east, and looked toward the rising sun. It dad been reared&#xD;
by an old Scotch couple, who had come hither in their&#xD;
ruddy youth, and so grown into the rooms with their&#xD;
bustling presence, that their memories never took leave,&#xD;
even after their grown children had witnessed the close&#xD;
of long lives of usefulness and work, and had laid them to&#xD;
sleep side by side in the old kirkyard, and their two sons&#xD;
(still called "boys" by their five sisters) reigned iA their&#xD;
stead.&#xD;
The McWhirters carried on the farm, piling up money&#xD;
with true Scotch thrift. They pillared the church, stand-.&#xD;
ing sure and firm on the old Calvinistic dogmas, looking&#xD;
out very sharp after lapses from stony orthodoxy and&#xD;
Presbyterian government, and they kept the minister in&#xD;
countenance by their presence, counsel, and substantial aid;&#xD;
diligent in business, serving the Lord. Such cheeses were&#xD;
nowhere pressed as in their dairy, such butter nowhere&#xD;
churned, such yarn nowhere spun, such carpets nowhere.&#xD;
striped.&#xD;
Balquither was a favorite gathering-place for the Cherry&#xD;
Brook young people, and the moonlight drive thither of&#xD;
two or three miles was a, most enjoyable prelude to the&#xD;
sprightly evening amongst the bright, witty McWhitevs,&#xD;
who had inherited enough of Gaelic accent and Scott'- h&#xD;
drollery to be the liveliest of entertainers.&#xD;
There are many gentlemen and ladies scattered up and&#xD;
down the land who cannot meet without talking over their&#xD;
Balqither frolics. The sugar parties, pic-nics, paring&#xD;
bees, huskings, and kindred festivities, they shared with&#xD;
their merry youth, when to laugh is .as easy as it is after-&#xD;
wards to sigh; before the dimples had all stretched down,&#xD;

to wrinkles, and a question had not yet arisen, whether&#xD;
or no white hair was becoming?&#xD;
There was a good deal of Gaelic beauty among the sis-&#xD;
ters, which lasted them far beyond their teenhood, crown-&#xD;
ing their woman-life with mtajesty and glory. Arabella's&#xD;
syminetry of figure and harmony of proportion gave&#xD;
her a remarkable presence, even after her freshness was&#xD;
gone. She looked extremely well out of doors of a morn-&#xD;
ing in her trim-fitting gown, training over the keeping-&#xD;
room windows the ancient vine of Matrimony, which&#xD;
she was wont to say "flourished passingly on the outer&#xD;
wall, but should never get leave to thrust so much as&#xD;
a tendril, or a modest wee purple blossom, inside the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
Margery's dimples and buxomness were perfect, and&#xD;
her handsome white hands never looked prettier than&#xD;
when waved about in the energy of the polemical dis-.&#xD;
cussions she gloried in..&#xD;
Elevir, fond of playing the part of diligent house-wife&#xD;
with her needle and her shears, gar "auld claithes look&#xD;
a'maist as weel as new." Elevir had good store of scissor-&#xD;
cases, table-mats, bed-spreads quilted in grape leaves,&#xD;
fancy holders, which she dispersed according to merit or,&#xD;
liking among her acquaintances.&#xD;
Gynot worked the flower-garden in summer, and tended&#xD;
the plants sheltered in the -narrow porch fronting the&#xD;
south, which she had caused to be sashed for them, in the&#xD;
winter days, when there were no cheeses to be made or&#xD;
yarn to-be spun. Great store of "weeds" had she there too&#xD;
(her brothers were fond of so traducing her pets, though&#xD;
they were quite willing to enjoy their sweets and revel&#xD;
in their greenery), calla lilies, rose geraniums, old fash-&#xD;
ioned fuchias and hyacinths, budded orange4rees, and&#xD;
&#xD;
GRO WETII SEED AND BLO WETH MEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jerusalem cherries, which rewarded\ her care with their&#xD;
brightness, and suggested pleasant musings.&#xD;
Effie, the blooming "youngest," worked with all, dip-&#xD;
ping into each dish of enjoyment, blithely singing, com-&#xD;
ing and going at her own sweet will, petted and cuddled&#xD;
by the household.&#xD;
As time passed on, many eyes were turned towards&#xD;
these comely women, dwelling so independently, living&#xD;
as they listed upon their own broad acres ; hoping to win&#xD;
one or other of therp, but to no purpose. The most at-&#xD;
tractive widowers failed to win a "yes ;" the sprightliest&#xD;
bachelors got for answer, "Nay, nay, I cannot, wonot&#xD;
buckle to.". Yet everybody said, what admirable wives&#xD;
they would make, and what a shame it was for such&#xD;
maidens to remain in single blessedness, when doubleness&#xD;
was so desirable. Even the epithet "old maids," which&#xD;
came occasionally to their ears, did not affright them " to&#xD;
jump," as Arabella said, "out of the frying-pan into the&#xD;
fire," on the day when she told Gynet she had just re-&#xD;
fused an old man, who was able to ride out pleasant days,&#xD;
and wanted a mate for the same reason they sought out a&#xD;
damsel for King David. "No, if I want to be'a nurse;&#xD;
I'll go into a hospital and done with it."  So they ac-&#xD;
cepted the stigma with smiling equanimity, and laughed&#xD;
-and chatted and worked, and, it may be, gossipped a&#xD;
little, cheerful and gay in spite of it.&#xD;
Side by side lay the other farm. Also fronting&#xD;
east, stood the roomy. brown house, half hidden bahii&amp;amp;&#xD;
tall trees, curtained by vines, embowered in roses, vhire&#xD;
'dwelt a family of women, who were a curiosity and a&#xD;
study to all their neighbors. They suffered no man about&#xD;
their premises, performing the labor of their land with&#xD;
their own hands: planting, gathering crops, threshing,&#xD;

&#xD;
husking and the like, without any assistance from the&#xD;
sterner sex, whom they entirely ignored and left out of&#xD;
their calculations.&#xD;
Five years ago they came suddenly, without warning,&#xD;
and settled on the place, which, having been sold to pay&#xD;
off a mortgage, was quietly bought, and they were in-&#xD;
stalled in their new home, before half their neighbors&#xD;
beoame aware that the property had changed hands.&#xD;
They had made no alteration in their habits or the&#xD;
fashion of their garments since that period; had spoken&#xD;
no words to anybody, except the barest, meagrest ones of&#xD;
trade. They attended no church, recognized no civilized&#xD;
forms, no kinship with their kind; and yet they were&#xD;
neither old nor ugly, and in spite of their strange gowns&#xD;
and manish labors, they carried the marks of culture and&#xD;
refinement.&#xD;
I said five women; that is not precisely correct, be-&#xD;
cause the youngest was scarcely more than a child in&#xD;
years and manners, and her next and best loved sister&#xD;
only twelve months and a half her senior.&#xD;
The wide acre fronting the road was laid, out in odd-&#xD;
shaped beds, and filled with flowers of all hues; choice,&#xD;
rare, costly, stately gentry of Flora's kingdom, who were&#xD;
however made to spread their beauties in the democratic&#xD;
society of the fields and woods, which were adopted and&#xD;
brought .home to this queer garden where rank was upset&#xD;
and custom gave' no law.,&#xD;
Though they were known far. and near as " the old&#xD;
maids," they had a good family name, with which the&#xD;
eldest signed contracts, when she bought the lands ad-&#xD;
joining, adding acre to acre.&#xD;
Olytie Dunwreath ruled the others with a firm power,&#xD;
asking no right, making no mention of authority, but&#xD;
&#xD;
which none ever dreamed of disputing or setting&#xD;
aside.&#xD;
Though in secret Orchis and little Candace might have&#xD;
whispered to each other, what sort of life they could&#xD;
choose to live, if they had the chance to choose, it was&#xD;
a breath too faint to ruffle their fate, and they accepted&#xD;
the dread necessity which pressed upon them, isolating&#xD;
them from the 'rest of the world. The twins, coming&#xD;
so mtich nearer the family desolation, seemed to have&#xD;
laid down their former existence, never to take it again.&#xD;
They worked on and on, in their every-day rut; and if&#xD;
either felt a want in their narrow round, they made no&#xD;
moan over the inevitable.&#xD;
Everywhere busy, everywhere efficient, was Goody&#xD;
Ruddock, as she was called in the family; "the Tom-big&#xD;
one,".by outsiders, who feared and disliked her.&#xD;
This great powerful Welsh woman had drifted towards&#xD;
the Dunwreaths out of a sea of trouble ; of woe too wide&#xD;
to see beyond. Her robust youth was spent op a Wen-&#xD;
lock farm, and her whole soul was bound up in a younger&#xD;
brother, to whom she stood for mother, nurse, and friend.&#xD;
Royal comfort she got out of her diverse offices, till one&#xD;
ugly day, when the lad was in his eighteenth year, and as&#xD;
pleasant in her eyes as her native Laurels, there came&#xD;
(pushed by his father, the Devil) a wandering vagrant to&#xD;
the house to be hired. The, season was. late, and her&#xD;
father accepted the fellow, glad of an extra hand in the&#xD;
harvest, and the woman's life was blasted from that hour.&#xD;
A vicious, depraved, skulking wretch,-a jail-bird who&#xD;
knew the inside of half the prisons in his own land,-&#xD;
a hulk that the sea wouldn't drown. (She had tossed him&#xD;
from her, out of a tempest which kept all the othersail-&#xD;

paven beds.), His picture hung in the rogues' gallery,&#xD;
and his life was an abomination in the sight of all men.&#xD;
This fellow poisoned the soul of her boy, her only good,&#xD;
filling his ears with tales of wild adventures, spun from&#xD;
crimes ; the end came soon. He ran off one night, joined&#xD;
a gang of thieves, robbed a bank-was tried and trans-&#xD;
ported, chained, to his tempter, who made his life a horror&#xD;
by his cruelty. Goody never wrought in Glendock one&#xD;
more day after she lost her treasure. She followed-him to&#xD;
London, to Sydney, which she reached the day after the&#xD;
great bush-fire, which swept off so many men and killed so&#xD;
muai cattle. The vagrant also had disappeared, but she&#xD;
found a man, who told her, he had seen the two mates&#xD;
together, and also that a rumor was about, of how the boy&#xD;
had been dirked and thrown into the burning; and no&#xD;
search could find her anything belonging to her darling,&#xD;
except an old coat and a shoe well worn. His hut was&#xD;
empty.&#xD;
but off from all motive for life, she returned to Wen-&#xD;
lock, to find her father dead and the homestead leased to&#xD;
strangers. She drifted away through the country, care-&#xD;
less of her fate-suffering, starving, till finally she got&#xD;
aboard of an emigrant ship and was landed in New York.'&#xD;
Thence she was wrecked at Mrs. Dunwreath's door, who&#xD;
took her in outof infinite pity, healed her bruises, shel-&#xD;
tered, clothed her, and gave her the twins to nurse. The.&#xD;
whole strong lovingness of the lone creature brightened,&#xD;
and kindled afresh, and her life centred. in the Dun-.&#xD;
wreath household, outside of whom she had no inter-&#xD;
ests, no sympathies.&#xD;
When the trouble burst upon them, and Olytie took up&#xD;
the new life, Goody Ruddoek stood manfully to the fore.&#xD;
Thoroughly' used to farm-work, accustomed to allifut -&#xD;

door labor, her powerful organization acknowledged no&#xD;
fatigue, asked no respite. She shouldered the heaviest&#xD;
burdens, and pushed right on through summer heat and&#xD;
winter cold; she conquered the elements and worked her&#xD;
will with earth's fruits.&#xD;
When telling her story to her patroness, she explained&#xD;
simply:&#xD;
"I did not kill the devil because I could not get my&#xD;
fingers to his throat, but when once my eyes light on him&#xD;
I shall straightway tear him to pieces! "&#xD;
Through all the following years of tender watching and&#xD;
kindness for her charge, a murder would surely have&#xD;
been a sequence of opportunity, if her brother'sfend hadc&#xD;
come under her hand.&#xD;
She bowed before Clytie with absolute submission,&#xD;
She reverenced her because of her awful sufferings; she&#xD;
pitied a heart torn and bleeding as her own had been;&#xD;
and she watched for times and seasons to do her service.&#xD;
She felt beside this in-wrought sympathy, a bond of&#xD;
duty to the representative of the dead lady who committed&#xD;
her children to her charge. With her last hand-kiss she&#xD;
had sworn an oath, to hover them under her vast mother-&#xD;
liness, as long as God let her breathe.&#xD;
Despite her past, Goody could smile, could laugh,--&#xD;
rather hoarsely, 'tis true,--and her voice was like a boom-&#xD;
ing cannon at its sweetest ; and when she drove her team&#xD;
afield the neighbors'could hear her great-volumed tones,&#xD;
and they made faces and said: "lIlumph, them old maids!&#xD;
the Tom big one is hooting her cattle."&#xD;
She sometimes petted the young ones, even yet in the&#xD;
new life, with a grim, rugged fondness, and was tireless&#xD;
in executing their commands, no obstacle ever coming be-&#xD;
tween their little wishes and her fulfilling them. The&#xD;

highest birds-nest, the wildest squirrel was captured. Bhe&#xD;
split the crows' tongues to make them talk, and she brought&#xD;
home the young wild-cat in her arms, in spite of his claws,&#xD;
for a birth-day gift to the "baby" Candace, Outsiders&#xD;
called her " surly, savage, horrible;" naught cared she-&#xD;
for their good or ill word, and she was seldom troubled&#xD;
with trespassers. Little boys ran like the wind at sight&#xD;
of her; little girls -called her a witch ; and grown-up&#xD;
folks were quite willing to let "the Tom big one " alone.&#xD;
She often carried "the young ones" on her back for long&#xD;
trmps at first, and after they outgrew that pastime, ghe&#xD;
hauled them in a rude sledge of her own construction,&#xD;
which she picked up bodily, when it became necessary to&#xD;
ord brooks or overstep obstructions. She occasionally&#xD;
baked    ie" and made candies; in fact most of the pleas-&#xD;
ures eof their narrow lives emanated from faithful Goody,&#xD;
andpit need not be told how dearly they loved her.&#xD;
It is not to be supposed, that girls of such blood and&#xD;
culture could exist even in their strange shut-in sphere,..&#xD;
without any attempt to adorn their surroundings. Gri-&#xD;
selda had her moss-baskets, ferns, trailing vines, autumn-&#xD;
leaves, aid the like. Vashti her pressed flowers, shells, and&#xD;
stuffed birds. She spelled out the taxidermist's craft from&#xD;
an old book, and Goody fetched her the drugs and the&#xD;
-    victims, and she also made'the case to hold them, of win-&#xD;
ter evenings. Owls stared, squirrels grinned, and hum-&#xD;
ming-birds perched on mossy twigs, the trophies of her zeal&#xD;
and skill, and but that she also experienced the earthly&#xD;
curse, " the moth and rust " which corrupt, she might&#xD;
have. filled the house from garret to cellar, so ardent was&#xD;
she in her labors.&#xD;
Each twin vied with the other in their production of&#xD;
bed-quilts and cushions; they drew patterns and planned&#xD;

novelties in every combination of circles and squares; and&#xD;
braided. mats and knotted fringes; but with all, and the&#xD;
best of all, their lives were unutterably wearisome, niar-&#xD;
row, thin, flat, dhll, stale; and the high board fence which&#xD;
enclosed their barns and sheds, effectually protecting&#xD;
them  from  impertinent intrusion (the key carefully&#xD;
guarded by Goody), felt to them often like prisQn walls.&#xD;
Among her father's possessions Clytie cherished a&#xD;
beautiful shot-gun, which practice in her last five years&#xD;
had taught her to use a rmerveille-and she spent whole&#xD;
days in the woods, never returning without a pouch full&#xD;
of game. The slyest weasel, the wickedest coon, the niin&#xD;
blest hares, the shyest birds, which haunt the depths of&#xD;
the stillest forests, were her trophies; yet if you watched&#xD;
her through her solitary tramps, you would fail to find in&#xD;
her any exaltation, any glow of triumph, any joy in suc-&#xD;
cess; only exact occupation, steady pursuit, determined&#xD;
persistence.&#xD;
None ever dared to commend her skill, though Vashti&#xD;
sometimes preserved her birds, and Goody cooked them;&#xD;
no word was spoken-the old creature received them si-&#xD;
lently, in strange, grim sympathy looking in her mis-&#xD;
tress' stony face as she felt the shot-marks and dabbled&#xD;
her fingers in the innocents' blood; or yet again seek-&#xD;
ing the prey n a corner, where the huntress had thrown&#xD;
it. Good and savory meals they made from the wood&#xD;
spoils; but, as none talked at table, neither the cook nor&#xD;
the viands got any praise.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
A BOY AT BALQUITHER.&#xD;
HE Springof which we are telling you, brought&#xD;
anew element of youth, activity, bustle, and&#xD;
briskness into the Balquither household, which&#xD;
was full of vigor, energy, and capability before.&#xD;
A boy had come to live among them; a boy with curls&#xD;
and roundabouts, a couple of voices, and untold pranks;&#xD;
a shouting, whistling, singing boy, who banged doors, up-&#xD;
set chairs, broke crockery, and cut. up generally; one of&#xD;
the torments, of whom Oliver Wendell Holmes says:&#xD;
"They ought to be kept in a barrel and fed through the&#xD;
bung hole, till they are twenty-one years old."&#xD;
Blush Beach by name, unblushing mischief by nature,&#xD;
good, hdnest, brave, but of the sort who are a daily&#xD;
trial to neat housewives and thrifty mothers.. le was no&#xD;
kin to the McWhirters, but the only son of an old friend,&#xD;
who, coming in the autumn to pay them a visit, had sick-&#xD;
ened and died in their house, and begged them with his&#xD;
latest breath to shelter the youth and care for him till he&#xD;
was old enough to fight 'the world for himself; entrust-&#xD;
imug them also with the United States bonds which were&#xD;
pis son's fortune.&#xD;
you may imagine what a flurry and a flutter entered&#xD;
&#xD;
the household along with this bright lad ; over-setting all&#xD;
arrangements, frolicking with the honored-customs, and&#xD;
disporting himself joyously in the motherhood of the&#xD;
women, which, having found no natural outlet, now fas-&#xD;
tened upon him, as pet, play-fellow, beau, comfort, and&#xD;
perpetual care; each mothering him in her own particu-&#xD;
lar vein ; so he got all he could manage of polemics;&#xD;
orthodoxy, farm-lore, teaching, snubbing, and catechism.&#xD;
Blush, who had knocked about the world, so far through&#xD;
his short life living in hotels, travelling from one country&#xD;
to another, settled joyfully into the nest feathered for&#xD;
him, and reciprocated the liking he got with fervent out-&#xD;
gushes from his warm, boyish heart.&#xD;
Blush was exceedingly interested in their accounts of&#xD;
the "old maids," and he passed a good many spare mo-&#xD;
ments peering under the trees, between fence-rails, and&#xD;
through bushes. He even mounted the high, broad-wall, at&#xD;
the risk of his limbs, and at price of dismal tears in his&#xD;
garments, and once went so far as to perch on the very&#xD;
summit of the tall hay-rick, hoping to espy their doings;&#xD;
but he was no further rewarded for his toil, than to get&#xD;
sight of a couple of slender women in straight gowns and&#xD;
shaker bonnets, feeding and ilking their cows, and&#xD;
a third, the centre of a great brood of poultry, who&#xD;
cackled and crowed and quacked all around her. On&#xD;
one occasion he watched a race between two young girls&#xD;
and a puppy--which tickled him much, especially as the&#xD;
dog got the best of it, and tumbled the lassies head-over-&#xD;
.heels among the littered straw. But he was near drop-&#xD;
ping from his roost, at the unexpected sound of Goody&#xD;
Ruddock's baritone, which suddenly smote his ear like&#xD;
the bray of a trumpet; and he crouched small; till she&#xD;
and her oxen had gotten well out of sight. Not that Bktsl  :&#xD;

was afraid: of course not; 'but there was something so&#xD;
queer in the.inanishness of Goody's voice, actions, occu-&#xD;

the 'ground, he, would not have stopped to parley; but&#xD;
being in mischief, and wIhere he had no right, he lay&#xD;
perdue till the coast was clear.&#xD;
It got to be quite an every-day question, when supper&#xD;
came and the boy showed his ruddy face at table: "Well&#xD;
Blush! laddie, and did you see the little old maid yet,&#xD;
where ye might say good-day lass, and Heaven bless ye?"&#xD;
and each time Blush replied, "No, not yet Auntie; but&#xD;
never fear, I'll soon come to speech of her;" and then&#xD;
would follow an account of his afternoon, eagerly listened&#xD;
to and enjoyed by the five, who brushed him up, patted?&#xD;
him down, and made of him in all ways.&#xD;
Blush had. a good deal to say about Cuba, Florida, Cal-&#xD;
ifornia, Para, and other places where lie had sojourned&#xD;
with his father, while the invalid was fighting the death&#xD;
which had conquered at last; and he said it so well,.that&#xD;
his mothers took great pleasure in his travels, and after a&#xD;

"I'll tell that to the little old maid, when I come to get&#xD;
acquainted with her."&#xD;

VANDACE, come here! who broke my lily?"&#xD;
The speaker was a tall, slender woman, about&#xD;
twenty-five, with a sverely beautiful countenance,&#xD;
whose lines were rarely, almost never disturbed by a ripple&#xD;
of feeling. Her eyes, as black as night, fringed ' and&#xD;
browed with shadowy perfection, looked 'out only to find&#xD;
the duties and needs of her life, and her admirably chis-&#xD;
elled lips got no leave to part in enjoyment of either, when&#xD;
well achieved. Her abundant hair, flossy and flaxen, was&#xD;
cropped straight in her neck and simply tucked behind&#xD;
ears which persisted, in spite of all their owner's indiffer-&#xD;
ence, in being rosy-tipped and beautiful. Her gown was&#xD;
of the commonest blue check, woven in her own loom, and&#xD;
of the scantiest, plainest pastern. Her shoes, clumsy and&#xD;
stout, could not hide the prettiness of her small feet,&#xD;
and though her hands were browned and hardened by&#xD;
constant labor, they kept their symmetry of shape, and&#xD;
her wrists their round perfection. In the strong leaitheriI&#xD;
belt which clasped her waist, she wore a little Derriuger,&#xD;
the gift of her father, who had prided himself upon her&#xD;
graceful skill in its use. ArTy trespassing dog or cat, any&#xD;

ieigh1bors availed. If she replied at all: she gave but&#xD;
oie answer: "Justice,-they trespassed and were pun-&#xD;
ished.".&#xD;
Men rarely sought a look from those black, cold eyes, or&#xD;
got near enough for speech ; women did sometimes, but&#xD;
curiosity generally had a surfeit of them in one interview,&#xD;
and they were glad to leave her alone.&#xD;
Candace unwillingly obeyed the call of the sister who&#xD;
waited for her, holding in one hand the faded blossom&#xD;
and in the other a hoe, with which she had been working&#xD;
her carnations,--a call which had all the imperative&#xD;
necessity of fate.&#xD;
Having known no other mother than Clytiminestra,&#xD;
she would have yielded her obedience, even if she had&#xD;
been reared in a less exceptional way; but shut in by&#xD;
their own fences, never speaking to or being addressed by&#xD;
anybody but her family for so many years of her life, she&#xD;
gave-not only the obedience which all about rendered to&#xD;
their ruler, but obedience mingled with the awe which&#xD;
had settled upon her at that dreadful time, when this same&#xD;
elder sister had been suddenly hardened from a cheery,&#xD;
helpful, sympathetic, loving girl, into a stony death-in-&#xD;
life, which no longer felt grief, nor carried sorrows, and&#xD;
to whom joy was unknown.&#xD;
Though tall enough for her fifteen years, Candace was&#xD;
dressed like a child, in a long, narrow cotton gown, with&#xD;
short sleeves, and a pinafore apron, and her feet and legs&#xD;
were bare. The shaker-bonnet which oughtto have&#xD;

sh ded her face, was tied byits strings, and hung down&#xD;
he back, and her finger-nails were filled with the mould&#xD;
frm the flower-roots she had been planting. Her head&#xD;
was covered with a mat of chestnut curls, and her nose&#xD;
turned up in the atchest manner: even the bridge of&#xD;
freckles across it looed cunning, and when not blanched&#xD;
with fear, her cheeks were beautiful with healthy roses;&#xD;
and troubled and frightened as were her eyes just now,&#xD;
they were capable of waggishness and drollery, which in-&#xD;
cited mirth in everybody except Clytie. Intended by Na-&#xD;
ture for one of those sunshine children whom everybody&#xD;
hugs and kisses; she shed many tears, was accustomed to&#xD;
blows and punishment.&#xD;
She came close to her sister, her cheeks flickering, her&#xD;
eyes dropped upon the ground, and her heart beat fast&#xD;
and hard enough to disturb the great artery in hey neck,&#xD;
which throbbed visibly; her small hand grasped a great&#xD;
trowel--clutched it, in fact.&#xD;
"How did you do this piece of mischief?"&#xD;
Clytie's voice was sweet, and yet it jarred on the lis en-&#xD;
er's ear like a harp out of tune, it was so utterly astray&#xD;
from concord with any human interest. It rang in metal-&#xD;
lie clearness, but lacking all thrill of feeling. It re-&#xD;
minded you of the dropping of icicles upon snow-crust,&#xD;
hard and cold.&#xD;
"You, will do well to answer my question quickly."&#xD;
"Ajax tumbled on it while I played with him."&#xD;
"Go get me the whip," repgi d the voice, so unchang-&#xD;
ing inIkne and quality, so inflexible of purpose.&#xD;
"It was my fault, Clytie ; do not beat Ajax."&#xD;
" I shall also beat you, presently. Call the dog."&#xD;
Candace stole, a look at the beautiful face where she&#xD;
had forgotten the glimmer of pity or mercy; there was&#xD;

none there now ; the black, intense eyes looked straight&#xD;
at her. and saw no kinship; the lips which formed the&#xD;
cruel words were humid and rosy in still repose the in-&#xD;
stant they were uttered. There was no anger, no inipa-&#xD;
tience, no revenge ; simple impassibility.&#xD;
The child obeyed, as a machine obeys the controller of,&#xD;
its wheels and pulleys, and presently returned, dragging&#xD;
by the collar a great shaggy Newfoundland puppy, who&#xD;
would have fled away as soon as he caught sight of Fate,&#xD;
who awaited him, had not Candace spoken softly to him ;&#xD;
but he cane unwillingly, scanning out of his red-veined&#xD;
eyes the being who was always a terror to him, even when.&#xD;
she held in her hand no broken blossom, which a piteous&#xD;
look acknowledged as his crime.&#xD;
Candace offered passively the whip which she had'&#xD;
fetched out of sight of her favorite, with an obedience&#xD;
which saw no use in resistance.&#xD;
"Ajax," said Clytie, holding up the drooping flower,&#xD;
"you have "broken my lily; now you must suffer for your&#xD;
act.&#xD;
The poor brute felt the power and mercilessness of the&#xD;
face and voice, and he lay down at the feet of his judge&#xD;
with up-stretched paws, and howled out his fear and sub-&#xD;
mission. He Might have stood up in his strength--the&#xD;
simple wretch who did not know that he 'had power&#xD;
enough to tear the frail woman limb from limb, and tram-&#xD;
ple out her life.  It is a merciful Providence which&#xD;
makes the hugest and strongest among men and other&#xD;
animals to be the most forbearing and kind, and often&#xD;
leaves them as it did poor Ajax, ignorant of their might.&#xD;
The blows fell thick and fast, and his cries were piteous&#xD;
to hear; so piteous that Candace, standing apart waiting&#xD;
her'turn, could not choose but weep, and the big tears&#xD;
&#xD;
were Still dropping silently, when Clytie took a step&#xD;
toward her, and said&#xD;
' Comne here, Candace."&#xD;
A shudder of sympathy for her favorite and dread for&#xD;
herself, passed over her, and the life current deserted her&#xD;
cheeks and lips which were white, but her eyes asked no&#xD;
pity, seeking the ground, and her teeth compressed her&#xD;
nether lip with a nervous resolution to endure and make&#xD;
no sign.&#xD;
"Put away the whip," said Clytie when its office was&#xD;
done, "and remember when again you desire to destroy&#xD;
my flowers, that the guilty must pay the penalty of jus-&#xD;
tice ; and think yourself fortunate if no law makes you&#xD;
suffer, being innocent."&#xD;
Candace did not immediately return to her, occupation&#xD;
after her sister had left her, but sat down onothe ground&#xD;
in a feuce corner, and Ajax, her companion in misery,'&#xD;
crept close to her with a whine, and she leaned over and&#xD;
buried her hot face in his shaggy coat, holding his head&#xD;
tightly clasped in her two arms.&#xD;
Blush Beach had been a wondering observer of this&#xD;
scene from his peeping-place Ibetween the boards. Blush&#xD;
could not understand at all the why of her non-resistance,&#xD;
being rather a contemner of authority himself, the&#xD;
natural: effect of his unrestrained and independent life&#xD;
which had 1eld him accountable to nobody; and he had&#xD;
to clench lhis teeth and his fists very hard, in the effort to&#xD;
keep to the precept instilled into him by his father, and so&#xD;
punctuated by his experience as to stand to him for a&#xD;
code of religion and morals:.&#xD;
"Always mind your own business, Blush, my boy, and,&#xD;
leave other people to mind theirs."&#xD;
This compendium of education lasted him through the&#xD;

scene and up to Clytie's departure whom he watched with&#xD;
glowering eyes disappear behind the great barn, but it&#xD;
failed to stead him any further in sight of the young girl&#xD;
sobbing out her wretchedness upon the neck of her faith-&#xD;
ful friend, who forgot his own misery in. sorrow for hers,&#xD;
and licked the hands which clasped him, from time to&#xD;
time,-mi token of sympathy.&#xD;
"What do you let her beat you for?" whispered he at&#xD;
last, when you are big and strong enough to pay her&#xD;
back?"benghtpahr&#xD;
Candace intently listened, lifting her head from its rest;&#xD;
and the dog also pricked up his ears, and snuffed the&#xD;
air. She could scarcely believe they were real spoken&#xD;
words, they were so close an echo of the inner thought&#xD;
she had been vainly trying to silence and quench in her&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Here I am, little old maid. Turn about and look at&#xD;
me, right here " (drumming on the boards to fix her gaze&#xD;
upon the especial knot-hole he was patronizing). "Blush&#xD;
Beach is my name. I live at Baiquither. I am sorry&#xD;
you are ill-treated."&#xD;
Candace sprang to her feet, and bringing her face close&#xD;
to the fence, she surveyed the speaker an instant. A maid&#xD;

- ing each other, they progressed so rapidly in acquaintance,&#xD;
that a mutual good understanding was commenced before&#xD;
another sentence was uttered.&#xD;
"Why do you let her ?" repeated Blush presently.&#xD;
"Because she is Clytie," replied Candace in a low&#xD;
whisper,--though she was being disobedient, she made&#xD;
the fault as faint as posible,-" and you must go away;&#xD;
it is not right for me t6,talk with you."&#xD;
"Why not, pray?"&#xD;
" Because Clytie forbids us to speak to any one."&#xD;
"'I am not any one. I am Blush Beach, a very particu-&#xD;

over your side before long. I've been looking out for a&#xD;
chance to talk with you days and days."&#xD;
"With me ! What forl When did you look ?"&#xD;
The astonishment at the discovery was mixed with&#xD;
pleasure in the strong determination he showed to persist&#xD;
in his course, which nearly took her breath away.&#xD;
"I heard about. you.; they told me over there -where I&#xD;
live; and I climbed to the top of your hay-rick, on the&#xD;

"What did you wantI "&#xD;

"O no ! I cannot. ' I dare not. I never go anywhere."&#xD;
"Well, it is time you did. Everybody says it is a shame&#xD;
the way they keep you shut up here: All my aunts, Ara-&#xD;

you ought to go to school and to church and to paring-&#xD;
bees. We're going to have a paring-bee. I want you to&#xD;

"I don't know what you mean," said Candace, And then&#xD;
Blush launched out into the charms of bees and other&#xD;
frolics, reiterating his declaration that she must join in&#xD;
them.&#xD;
" I wish I could; but I can't," said Candace with a&#xD;
sigh.&#xD;
" Why notYou can climb a fence, I know, and you've&#xD;
a tongue to speak your mind."&#xD;
"No, I haven't got any mind, and if I had 'twouldn't&#xD;

Orchis would feel sorry and cry.; butthey couldn't help&#xD;

"Well, you are a foolish girl to let her. She is not your&#xD;
another. Why should you fear her so ? "&#xD;
"She is our sister. But we are not like other folks.'&#xD;
Clytie shuns all. strangers. She says we must not have&#xD;
anything to do with them ; we must hate them."&#xD;
' Well, that is an odd kind of'doctrine! 'Tis not what&#xD;
the aunies tell me. They say I must try to love all human'&#xD;

"Do they? Well I think that much the pleasantest way&#xD;
to do. I'm sure I cannot be cross to folks that never Tdid&#xD;
me any harm."&#xD;

"That's the talk ! Now just begin by liking me, and&#xD;
you see if we don't manage to have some tip-top times&#xD;
together.",&#xD;
"I do like you. I don't have to try; it comes itself."&#xD;
"Qf course it does. That shows it is all right. Now you&#xD;
jump like a squirrel and I'll catch you, and when you're&#xD;
safe oyer, we'll go and see Sister Polly."&#xD;
"Oh no," said Candace, who. though she was ready&#xD;
enough to chat with an agreeable youth, was still a long&#xD;
way from making up a plan to run off with him. "I&#xD;
can't do-that, I'm afraid. Oh, dear ! there's Olytie; she's&#xD;
calling to Goody."&#xD;
The sound of her sister's voice brought the poor child&#xD;
to her senses, and made her feel very guilty indeed; and&#xD;
.she hastened quickly away, making no reply to the whis-&#xD;
pered "Good-by," and the promise to come again, which&#xD;
her new friend sent after her.&#xD;
The next day when Blusr returned whistling from&#xD;
school with his satchel over his shoulder, he jumped the&#xD;
enclosure and put his eyes to the fence of separation, and&#xD;
somehow Candace happened to be within ear-shot, and so&#xD;
each afternoon he managed to stop at the trysting-place,&#xD;
and being there, he told boy frolics and pranks and&#xD;
showed the lessons he studied, and (made fun of the&#xD;
teacher, and boasted his battles-his victories in " cut&#xD;
jacket " and "yards-off," and glorified himself man&#xD;
fashion among themes in which she, a girt, could have no&#xD;
place, and worked his life in among her thoughts and&#xD;
fancies with ingenuity and dispatch. Before the end of&#xD;
a week he made it a point to meet her in the far pasture&#xD;
when she drove home the cows, and walk up the lane in&#xD;
her company ; and he was not to blame for talking about&#xD;
his travels and adventures to so wrapt and eager a lis-.&#xD;

tener, who always wanted to know more, and revelledin&#xD;
the new-found pleasure. A companion ! outside her kin,&#xD;
would have been a wonder; but a boy friend ! and such&#xD;
a bo4T! She built on Blush her ideal of the other sex, and&#xD;
though her body stopped in the garden, and her hands&#xD;
were busy pulling wicked weeds, she also walked abroad&#xD;
in the wide world, the friend of hundreds and hundreds&#xD;
of excellent creatures, brave, merry and frolicsome, and&#xD;
dreamed herself through every phase of existence he had&#xD;
opened to her imagination, till she forgot her task, her&#xD;
narrow boundaries, in the Arcadia she created.&#xD;
But though these were wonderful days to Candace, it&#xD;
must not be supposed they were unalloyed. The child&#xD;
could not meet her sister's eyes. She kept more than&#xD;
ever aloof and felt herself a guilty creature ; and she&#xD;
replied to Blush's frequent protestations, that she was&#xD;
only using the good liberty which belonged to her, and&#xD;
could not lawfully be taken from her, in a proper and&#xD;
pleasant way: "But you know, Blush, we are not like&#xD;
other folks." Still the world was a wider world, and the&#xD;
longings to have some of his knowledge and realize&#xD;
some of his experiences, could never be set at rest again;&#xD;
and the prisoner feeling was so strong upon her that&#xD;
she made haste to set free the pet wildcat, which only&#xD;
stopped for a couple of snarling sniffs at the air beyond&#xD;
the length of his chain and made a bee-line for the&#xD;
woods, without so much as a look behind him. Can-&#xD;
dace watched his long leaps and the swish of his hand-&#xD;
some tail, and sighed. If she could but find some day&#xD;
a way 'to cut loose from her bondage, and use her facul-&#xD;
ties as he did his legs.&#xD;
She said something like this to her sister Orchis, with&#xD;
whom she shared all her life ; and she begged her to&#xD;
&#xD;
65&#xD;
&#xD;
come and have an interest in her new friend.    But&#xD;
though Orchis mused in secret over what she heard, and&#xD;
lent open ears to Blush's tales from Candace's lips, she&#xD;
steadily refused to take a step toward him.&#xD;
"No, Candace, pet," said she ; " I chafeand fret under&#xD;
our life; I feel it drearier and harder than ever, since&#xD;
you have got your friend; but I am glad he is yours. I&#xD;
cannot halve such a possession. If he was rmine, I should&#xD;
want him all to myself. I am afraid I should not be as&#xD;
generous as you. I should be selfish."&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
A VISIT TO SISTER POLLY.&#xD;
IIE temptation got too strong at last. Candace&#xD;
ceased to resist, and one morning when Blush&#xD;
Beach met her in the lane with a basket of par-&#xD;
cels he was commissioned by the Balquither ladies to&#xD;
carry to Sister Polly, and begged and entreated hei to,&#xD;
come along, she turned about, and though she looked&#xD;
behind her a great many times, she finally followed, and&#xD;
then stepped by his fide.&#xD;
All her life she remembered that walk, the delicious&#xD;
sense of largeness, of expansive liberty, after she really&#xD;
passed the farm boundaries, mingled with trembling&#xD;
dread every time she thought of Clytie, and the probable&#xD;
consequences of her stolen pleasure.&#xD;
Her sister had gone to the woods at daybreak with her&#xD;
gun, and her habits when she took such a 'tramp gener-&#xD;
ally kept her afoot till nightfall. Goody Ruddock&#xD;
carried a load of grain to Cherry Brook to exchange for&#xD;
needful stores, and Blush assured Candace again and&#xD;
again, that they two would be safe back befcre either&#xD;
was returned. But she felt so degraded by her -dis-.&#xD;
obedience, that she could not help talking about it to her&#xD;
friend, who stoutly combatted her impressions,&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are not doing wrong," insisted he, " because sie&#xD;
has got no business to make such a law. Look a-here! -it&#xD;
says in my constitution book, that all people have the&#xD;
right 'to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' You&#xD;
are a people, so you have the right. If she was Sour&#xD;
mother she couldn't take it away from you; and as she&#xD;
isn't your mother, only your sister, she has no authority&#xD;
to say what you shall do anyhow."&#xD;
3 Candace listened. awe-struck to this high-handed&#xD;
heresy, and after gathering all the help she was able from&#xD;
his positive face and manner, she replied slowly:&#xD;
"-Perhaps it is so. I could not make it come true all&#xD;
at once if it was. You know we are not like other folks."&#xD;
"You have said that half a dozen times before. Now&#xD;
what makes you think 'so-what is the reason you feel&#xD;
different?"&#xD;
"There ! I knew you would sooner or later ask me that&#xD;
question. Orchis said you would. You mustn't do it&#xD;
again ! Unless you will promise not to,.I shall turn&#xD;
right back and never speak to you any; more. It is&#xD;
enough to see how we live, to feel that there is something&#xD;
behind it. I thought you said you always minded your&#xD;
own business, and let 'other people mnind theirs."&#xD;
"So I do. Enough said, Candace," answered Blush.&#xD;
" You are a brave little trump. Don't be vexed with my&#xD;
chin-music. I shouldn't be a mite afraid to tell youa&#xD;
secret. You've got sense enough to hold it fast. I like&#xD;
you ever so much better, because you can't be sifted as&#xD;
my Aunt Elevir does the meal through her big collander."&#xD;
"I am glad--I was afraid you might be angry."&#xD;
"Angry! not I. I'm too smart to get angry with you.&#xD;
What would become of all my good times? But there's&#xD;
one thing certain sure. You must let mc come and. call&#xD;

on  lytie. I'll get in through some crack in the fence,&#xD;
or I'll bolt over it, and I will make her talk. My Aunt&#xD;
Efie says it can't be done. I know better. I'd like to&#xD;
see the woman I can't make talk; wouldn't youth I'll&#xD;
just march right up in front of her, and. pull off my&#xD;
skimmer, and I'll ask her to let you come toour paring-&#xD;
be-very polite and pleasant. I will, sure -as winking"&#xD;
The idea of being polite and affable with Clytie was&#xD;
so monstrous, that though Candace laughed a little at his&#xD;
bows and   ahems " and "if you please ma'ams," she&#xD;
nearly shuddered also, and her disturbed face tickled&#xD;
Blush so much, that he tore off his rusty cap and threw it&#xD;
up and dashed about and caught it .on his red head half&#xD;
a dozen times, before he went any further.&#xD;
When they reached the long wood, Blush stopped and&#xD;
hunted a straight stick of alder, considerably longer than&#xD;
himself, and having tested its strength by using it as a&#xD;
leaping pole and fencing lance, much to Candace's ad~&#xD;
miration, he invited the pretty maid to sit beside him on&#xD;
a mossy log, while he did a little ornamentation with the&#xD;
ever ready jack-knife, without which no lad feels himself&#xD;
quite a well-appointed and perfect boy.&#xD;
Now I am going to carve our names and the day of&#xD;
the month, and I think I'll put on something else to re-&#xD;
member our first walk by. This is a white dayin my&#xD;
calendar, as the fox said to the snow storm, and I don't&#xD;
expect ever to forget it, and I think I'd better make our&#xD;
ages too. I'm sixteen myself, last 'tater harvest. How old&#xD;
are you,"&#xD;
"I'm fifteen. Orchis is sixteen and a half."&#xD;
"Fifteen! a very pretty age for a girl. I was kinder&#xD;
afraid you was older than me. You are just about as&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why were you afraid? What odds would it make?$ "&#xD;
"None in particular; only a notion of mine;" and&#xD;
Blush smiled to himself as he remembered a dictum of&#xD;
his father's:&#xD;
"Blush, now mind what I tell you: don't you ever&#xD;
marry a woman that is fifteen minutes older than you&#xD;
are. If you do, you'll get henpecked, and have your nose&#xD;
held to the grind-stone."&#xD;
"How came your folks to call you Candace . he asked&#xD;
after a little more whittling.&#xD;
"For the same reason that yours called you Blush, I&#xD;
dare say,--because they had to give me a name."&#xD;
"That's sense; and~ yours isn't queerer than mine,&#xD;
either, though Aunt Efie says mine just fits me, and she&#xD;
always feels like saying 'come and be kissed,' every time&#xD;
she sees me. You don't feel that way, do you,?" he added&#xD;
with a saucy wink.&#xD;
"Not a bit," she replied, laughing. "Your face does&#xD;
look nice and clean, though, as if somebody had jst&#xD;
scrubbed it with soap, and your cheeks are red. I like&#xD;
your looks."&#xD;
"So do I yours, Candace, Queen of Ethiopia. Did&#xD;
you know you had(got a queen's name, you little Ameri-&#xD;
can old maid?"&#xD;
"No, I never heard of such a place. Tell me about&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"There were a great many hers. They called all their&#xD;
queens Candace, and there was a lot of them. One of&#xD;
them was blind of an eye and a great warrior, another&#xD;
wrote sacred books ; and they were posted on women's&#xD;
rights in that old country, I can tell you.. Their kings&#xD;
never had any individual names, but were just lumped&#xD;

the fore much anyhow. The queens attended to things&#xD;
and were all called Candace."&#xD;
" How nice ! I wish I had been one of those Candaces."&#xD;
"I guess not.  The Ethiopians are as black as the&#xD;
ace of spades. You couldn't have had your pretty brown&#xD;
eyes, nor your pink cheeks, nor your sort-o'-reddish curls,&#xD;
nor the cunning little freckles across your cundu g little&#xD;
nose."&#xD;
Caudace gave the nose a dab upward as she laughed&#xD;
gleefully. "I had no idea boys were so amusing," said&#xD;
she. " I wish I knew ever so many.1"&#xD;
"'There! I expected that. I knew it was bound to&#xD;
come, but I didn't suppose it would burst out to-day.&#xD;
Do be contented with me for the present, Candace, can't.&#xD;

"I shall have to be. I've no choice."&#xD;
"flow teazing. Where did you learn to be such a pro-&#xD;

"I did not know that I was. I didn't mean to plague&#xD;
you, Blush."&#xD;
"Well, you do when you say such things. You add a&#xD;
nail to my coffin every time, so be careful.  Now I&#xD;
must cut a dot, period, full stop, after the fifteen. The&#xD;
years won't stop though, and \vheri we are old fops I'll,&#xD;
ask you to show me this stick, and then we'll talk over&#xD;
our good times when we were in our teens."&#xD;
" Old folks," repeated Candace, looking at her com-&#xD;
panion's fresh face; "how queer: you, bald-headed like&#xD;
the pedler I peeped at through the gate yesterday. His&#xD;
head looked like an egg. Me, gray and wrinkled like&#xD;
Goody Ruddock! i couldn't bear to think of you and&#xD;

You've got to get married first, and have lots of children,&#xD;

"No, I shan't ever be married." Candace shook her&#xD;
head and looked quite melancholy over the single-blessed&#xD;
prospect.&#xD;
"Why not, pray?"&#xD;
"Because I'm one of 'the old maids.' Don't you call&#xD;
me it again though, unless you want to make me nad as&#xD;
fire. Nobody is ever going to have any of us. Orchis&#xD;
says so-we're not like other folks."&#xD;
"Pooh ! just you give them the chance. Open the gate,&#xD;
call off the dogs, and you'll have a string of fellows as&#xD;
long as from here to Cherry Brook in less than a week."&#xD;
"Fellows! gentlemen, you mean. I don't believe that.';&#xD;
"Maybe you don't know you are a handsome girl.&#xD;
Come here and look at your face then, 'Miss Agnes.'&#xD;
That's what my father used to call all simple girls, who&#xD;
had never been in love."&#xD;
He pulled her to the little pond before them, and gazed&#xD;
with her intb its depths at their two faces.&#xD;
"Aren't you?" asked he, after a moment's silence.&#xD;
"No," she replied, with a toss of her head ; " I'm not&#xD;
pretty. My chin is too sharp. Vashti says she could&#xD;
pick her teeth with it. I don't care. Orchis is pretty."&#xD;
" So are you, Candace, and before you find out yourinar-&#xD;
ket value, I guess I'd better pop. So 'here goes: Will&#xD;
you marry ,me."&#xD;
"I don't know as I'will. I may as well wait for' the&#xD;

J2A VISIT TO SISTER POLLY.&#xD;
Our names, ' Candace Dunwreath, Blush Beach,' our&#xD;
ages, and the date. Now I think sweet-heart would look&#xD;
nice under our names; don't you? right here!"&#xD;
"What is a sweet-heart?"&#xD;
"Why, lover, beau, spark; the chap that takes you to&#xD;
all the frolics, fetches you candy and flowers, and marries&#xD;
you after-a while !"&#xD;
"yYou need not say that ; I won't have you say it !" cried&#xD;
Candace, springing to her feet. "They don't marry--I&#xD;
know all about that. They break her heart! they-"&#xD;
"They what ? " asked Blush, in wide-eyed astonish-&#xD;
ment, as she fell back on the log and shut her lips tight.&#xD;
"Nothing. Let's go on ; I'm tired of resting."&#xD;
"As true as winkin', you came near letting me mind&#xD;
your business, Candace, didn't you ? Some day you will&#xD;
come to me and say, 'Blush, I want to tell you something!I'&#xD;
I shall. be a tall fellow in. swallow-tails, maybe, before&#xD;
that, but it will come. We will be friends as long as we&#xD;
live; won't, we Candace?"&#xD;
" I hope so," replied the girl with a half shudder;  I&#xD;
hope so. Oh! how I shiver; I feel chilly !"&#xD;
"When your flesh creeps that way, it is a sign some-&#xD;
body is walking over your grave, so Aunt Gynet/says;&#xD;
but I don't take stock in all their notions."&#xD;
" My grave ! where ?" cried Candace, springing to her&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
"I don't know where; but of course you will have to&#xD;
be buried somewhere. Not for a good while yet, I hope.&#xD;
Not till I've carved the sweetheart on this stick."&#xD;
" I want to be happy before I die," answered she&#xD;
wistfully. "I want to be free, like you."&#xD;
" Free with me, you mean. Thank you; that's hunky-&#xD;
dory."&#xD;
&#xD;
A VISIT TO SISTER POLLY.&#xD;
aI want Orchis to be happy too."&#xD;
"We must find some fellow who will coax her out of&#xD;
the 'old maid' list, and she'll be happy enough. The way&#xD;
to be happy is to get married."&#xD;
"That is news to me," said Candace. "I don't hear&#xD;
such talk in my house. 'I shouldn't wonder if it was true.&#xD;
though."&#xD;
" It is true ; you and I will prove it some day."&#xD;
They took each an end of the staff he had fashioned,&#xD;
and went on their way; but they had set a mark in their&#xD;
lives, to which they often turned back during its onward&#xD;
march. To-day it was a bright dash of boy and girl gay-&#xD;
ety. What it should be in the future depended on so many&#xD;
contingencies, that it was as well, perhaps, that they could&#xD;
not see ahead. Sufficient to the day was the pleasure&#xD;
thereof. They found a real mole-hill. Blush told Can-&#xD;
dace how it was called the "nmouldiwarp " in England,&#xD;
long before Alfred the Great sat upon the throne of&#xD;
Wessex, and how his father had helped him dig out one,&#xD;
once, when they were staying in the North; and laying&#xD;
down the ornamented staff, he-set to work to show her the&#xD;
wonderful chambers, and courts, and streets, hoping to&#xD;
find an inhabitant, that lie might prove to her that the&#xD;
active hunter is not blind, only cat-like about the eyes, in&#xD;
its power of seeing in the dark. Unfortunately the mole&#xD;
was out ; but lie did gather some "sky-stained eggs " of&#xD;
the scolding wren, which he showed her how to blow free&#xD;
from their contents. He also promised her a young&#xD;
crow, which she could tame and teachto talk. In short,&#xD;
he was so interesting and amusing, that the way seemed&#xD;
marvellously short to the home of the old maid they were&#xD;
going to visit, and she was almost sorry when they arrived.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
CRANN1~Y MI1NSOT AT IO1 fl.&#xD;
&#xD;
HE Pember family-Jonathan, David, and Polly&#xD;
-lived on a sort of peninsula which in wet times,.&#xD;
became an island, and when Cherry Brook swelled&#xD;
with heavy rains they were cut off from the rest of the&#xD;
world for weeks together, with whom they mingled little&#xD;
enough in the sunniest of times.&#xD;
The farm had never been owned by any but Pembers&#xD;
since Indian days, and the strong family peculiarities had&#xD;
been handed down froi generation to generation without&#xD;
softening ; and their oddities made them objects of curi-&#xD;
osity to the young folks of the-country round, who were&#xD;
fond of paying them visits, as pilgrims visit ruins or the&#xD;
Shakers, or Philansterys, or any other cluster of mortals&#xD;
who order their lives to their own liking, without refer-&#xD;
erce-to, the herd called society.&#xD;
Such guests always received hospitality without grudg-&#xD;
ing, as long as all inclinations to mirth could be kept out&#xD;
of sight ; but if an unlucky giggler broke out, or was&#xD;
caught "making fun," welcome was clouded, and being&#xD;
thenceforward considered outsiders, they were without&#xD;
ceremony-invited to take leave,-and appear no more.&#xD;
~  bridge had never joined them to the main land, ad At4&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
low water Cherry Brook was easily forded; and the few&#xD;
pedestrians who reached the farm made their entrance by&#xD;
hopping from one to another of the great mossy stones&#xD;
which were bedded too deep to.be moved by the wildest&#xD;
rushing freshet.&#xD;
" Now don't laugh, Candace, when you see them," ad-&#xD;
vised Blush, as, having leaped ashore, he and she stopped&#xD;
to lave their feet in the musically rippling water which&#xD;
hurried past them. I never knew for certain, but I&#xD;
always supposed that Blush left off his shoes and stock&#xD;
ings on this tramp, a good deal out of compliment to&#xD;
Candace, who wore neither ; at any rate, he relished com&#xD;
paring the masculine and feminine feet which, thrust&#xD;
forward side by siie, enjoyed the cool bath they got&#xD;
among the water-arrows and rushes.&#xD;
"Why should I laugh?"&#xD;
Youcan see fun easy ; anybody .could know that by&#xD;
the cock of your nose ; and they are real queer. They&#xD;
don't do things as other folks do-but they are always&#xD;
glad to see me. Sister Polly says I am a desput nice lit&#xD;
tie shaver, and Jonathan and David get me to tell where&#xD;
I have been, till I feel quite proud to have seen so&#xD;
much."&#xD;
While they were talking, an old one-horse wagon came&#xD;
rattling down the stony road into the ford, and as the&#xD;
clumsy hoofs of the shaggy animal, called by courtesy&#xD;
"the colt;" splashed near enough to send some scattering&#xD;
drops of the brook-water over Candace, she moved hastily&#xD;
aside, and Blush called out to a tall, lanky man who was&#xD;
driving him:&#xD;
"How de do,, Jonathan! Don't spatter so ! We are&#xD;
coming to visit you; and I've got a lot of things from idy&#xD;
aunties for Sister Polly."&#xD;

Mr. Pember hauled in his beast vith his rope lines, and&#xD;
pulling off his hat, passed an'inviting hand over his scat-&#xD;
tering white hairs, coaxing 'them to the fore. "Yes, yes,&#xD;
Blush," said he; "that's right ! always tickled to see you;&#xD;
and who is the little lass that's washing her feet amongst&#xD;
the pollywogs 2 "&#xD;
"Candace Dun wreath, Jonathan. I asked her to come&#xD;
along and see Sister Polly. I expect they'll be great&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
Mr. Pember fixed his lips as if he wanted to whistle ;&#xD;
but he thought better of it, and having unpuckered them&#xD;
again, he said:&#xD;
Oho! one of the old maids ! how desput curous ! I've&#xD;
always heerd as how them critters didn't go nowheres, no&#xD;
more than us Pembers do. Everybody to their notion!&#xD;
What makes you look so cross, little girl? You was as&#xD;
smilin' as a basket of chips afore I come."&#xD;
"I hate being called old maids !. I hate folks that do it!&#xD;
We are not old! I am but fifteen, and Clytie is only&#xD;
twenty-five."&#xD;
"Oh well, don't speak up so peart. I didn't tack the&#xD;
name onto you, and I s'posed you was pretty much used to&#xD;
it by this time. Come, hop up ! We'll give you the best&#xD;
we've got; and Blush, he shall finish his yarn about the&#xD;
monkey-hunt."&#xD;
" No I won't ! 'not a step !" said Candace. " I wis I&#xD;
hadn't come. I shall go right home. 9lytie said true; I&#xD;
know it now ! I'll-go back and stay as long as' I live.  I&#xD;
won't stop with folks who call ns nasty names ! ". -&#xD;
"Now you've made her mad, Jonathan,! Tell her you&#xD;
don't mind being called 'long timber."'&#xD;
"Long timber," repeated Candace, looking up and&#xD;
down the occupant of the wagon, whose knees were nearly&#xD;

on a level with his ears, "is that because you are so&#xD;
tall?"&#xD;
"Yes, and his name is Pember, you see ; " put in&#xD;
Blush, eager to make the most of the opportunity to turn&#xD;
her thoughts.  "Pember-timber, that's the way they&#xD;
make names. There's a couple of boys in our school&#xD;
named Meter, and we call them long Metre and com-&#xD;
mon Metre; and there's a little girl with just such&#xD;
curls as yours, and everybody, that likes her calls her&#xD;
Topsy."&#xD;
"That likes her!" said Candice, doubtfully.&#xD;
"Yes, of course. We don't take such liberties with&#xD;
unpleasant people ; we give them a wide berth, and the&#xD;
longest kind of handles to their names."&#xD;
Candace looked at Mr. Pember because he made such&#xD;
la queer noise, a kind of wheeze and a cough mixed, and&#xD;
his face was very red, and his month stretched, and he&#xD;
was saying something which sounded.like, "Cute, cute as&#xD;
a weasel! by jingo ! Come, be good friends' and ride.; "&#xD;
he added, nodding to her. " If they don't call us late to.&#xD;
dinner, the rest isn't of much consequence, is it, Miss-&#xD;
Miss-Duinsumi ?"&#xD;
"Dunwreath, Jonathan-Candace Dunwreath-that's&#xD;
her name. No thank you, we've come out for a tramp,&#xD;
and we feel like carrying the idea through. You jog&#xD;
along ; we'll keep up with you. Hillo! there's Sister&#xD;
Polly looking out of the front door!&#xD;
-" That's so ! Well, I dunno but you'd. as good foot it&#xD;
after all, because you might mash up the things, and&#xD;
they've got to last half a year."&#xD;
. " I wish I had a hammer ; I'd pound old sorrel along&#xD;

"The little girl kinder laffs at that; she feels better, I&#xD;
guess," said Jonathan, grinning at Candace.&#xD;
Blush 'took off his cap and swung it round his head.&#xD;
"Here we are, Sister Polly ; trot out your nut-cakes !"&#xD;
She looked like one of the wooden women in a Noah's&#xD;
ark and was dressed in blue and white check and apron&#xD;
guiltless of fit, and evbry hair was dragged to the back of&#xD;
hter head into a knob about the size of a butternut. What&#xD;
little expression there was in her face was sharp and acute,&#xD;
and her small gray eyes twinkled brightly from their set-&#xD;
ting-of wrinkles. She seemed a good deal pleased to see&#xD;
Blush, who shook her pump-handles of arms and jerked&#xD;
her rather unceremoniously by the same sticks of mem-&#xD;
bers, which caused her to hop toward him as the little&#xD;
toy-people do, who are set up to dance on the piano, and&#xD;
jig about stiff, like bits of chips as they are ; while Can-&#xD;
dace stood back quietly, eying her over.&#xD;
"Oh, one of the old maids! " answered Sister Folly to&#xD;
Blush's presentation of the girl. "Well, glad to see you."'&#xD;
Blush puckered up' his mouth and shook his head at&#xD;
Sister Polly, trying to stop her utterance of the dangerous&#xD;
words, fearful of a fresh explosion, and was quite aston-&#xD;
ished to see Candace part her fresh lips in a smile, while&#xD;
she gave her retrousse nose a little brush upwards, as&#xD;
was her habit when amused ; and as he looked, he noticed&#xD;
afresh how extremely cunning and arch she was, with her&#xD;
crop of short chestnut curls, and her head stuck on one&#xD;
side, while her eyes danced and sparkled with fun.&#xD;
"-Land ! what a difference there seems to be between&#xD;
snooks and sneezers!" said Jonathan. "Why don't you&#xD;
go and get mad at Folly as you did at me, when I let out&#xD;
them words ?"&#xD;
" Because she's one herself-a real old one," answered&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANNY MUNSON AT HOMI.J79&#xD;
Candace; "and I don't mind being it half so much when&#xD;
there's such nice ones."&#xD;
"Mindin' ain't neither here nor there,'' replied Sister&#xD;
Folly. "If we don't get caught without nopile into our&#xD;
lamp, and shut from the great marriage of the last, like&#xD;
them pawky critters we read on in the good Book, we&#xD;
needn't mind no great whether we belong to any gaby&#xD;
fellow in this vale. of tears or no. Come in and make&#xD;
yourselves to home. I'm to home, and I wish you was.&#xD;
Set down and be comfortable."&#xD;
This being Miss Pember's ordinary way of making wel-&#xD;
come, Blush took it in good part, hung up his cap in the&#xD;
entry, and he and Candace entered the great, square, low&#xD;
room, whose floor was sanded in patterns, and nearly half&#xD;
one side of which was occupied by a vast chimney, hav-&#xD;
ing a wide hearth, well redded in brick-dust and skim-&#xD;
milk.&#xD;
An old-fashioned bake-kettle rested upon a bed of live&#xD;
coals before the forestick; and Miss Polly hardly waited&#xD;
to assist at Candace's indoor toilet, which was made by&#xD;
doing the knotted strings which supported the " shaker "&#xD;
half-way down her back, before she made a long legged&#xD;
dive at the iron lid, covered with embers, and jerked it&#xD;
angrily off.&#xD;
"Oh you pawky biscuits!:"exclaimed she, "you want to&#xD;
burn all to cinders, don't you? while a body's saying a&#xD;
pleasant word. Just like you! there now!"&#xD;
She had hardly adjusted her little differences with her&#xD;
cakes, before she discovered the gray cat on her tea-table.&#xD;
"Pawky cat!" said she, grabbing grimalkin by his tail&#xD;
and drawing him so swiftly backward, that table-cloth,&#xD;
"apple sass " and all would have followed in his spread&#xD;
claws, if Blush had not sprung to the rescue.&#xD;

"Take care, Sister Polly !" said he. " Be mistress of&#xD;
yourself, or china will fall!"&#xD;
"I'll mistress him, pawky critter !" replied Miss Pem-&#xD;
ber; and so often had she heard the word already, that&#xD;
Candace unconsciously went on fitting it to her surround-&#xD;
ings-"pawky men, pawky women, pawky cat, pawky&#xD;
boy," etc., till it seemed to become thoroughly descrip-&#xD;
tive of all Sister Polly's circuinambients.  Miss Peniber&#xD;
jumped about the room with a dot and carry one gait, as if&#xD;
her legs were not equal, and Candace felt quite sorry for&#xD;
her; but she afterwards found out that it was only habit.&#xD;
iHaving been all her life a diligent spinner, she walked as&#xD;
if following her wheel, and whatever cooking utensil she&#xD;
carried in her hand, be it a spoon, fork, or butcher-knife,&#xD;
did duty for a whirl-pin, when she was perplexed or an-&#xD;
noyed. This Blush explained to the visitor, ont in the&#xD;
porch, while the hot bread, so dear to all country tastes,&#xD;
was getting faked.&#xD;
Pretty soon Brother David came in on tiptoe, lifting&#xD;
his broomstick' legs with care, and gently handling his&#xD;
toes, and being introduced to Candace, he took a good&#xD;
look at her, and presently hitched his chair close&#xD;
to hers, and said behind his hand, with much earnest&#xD;
mess:&#xD;
"Won't you go outside a minute and put your head in&#xD;
a barrel and say ' Miss Pember,' and see if it don't sound&#xD;
nice;" which in Brother David's case was equivalent to a&#xD;
declaration of love, and an offer of his heart and fortune.&#xD;
his ruling passion being to get himself a-young wife; and&#xD;
lie seldom permitted any pretty girl to depart out of his&#xD;
sight, without proposing the barrel-test.&#xD;
"Oh you pawky nincompoop," said: Sister Polly grin-&#xD;
nling. " What do you allow she wants with youi Look at&#xD;

your fiddle-sticks. They'll be stiff in your coffin before&#xD;
long. Miss Pember! Oh shaw! get along with you.&#xD;
As the cooking-fork, with which she was trying the&#xD;
sausages, began to revolve in her wheel-hand, Blush seized&#xD;
her by the waist and spun her about the room, showing&#xD;
a good deal of blue stocking and list slippers in the round.&#xD;
"I praise God in thejlance," said she, grinily sniling-&#xD;
as he landed her breathless and.not offended on the settle.&#xD;
"Pawky boy-you ought to be spanked,'and you'll get it&#xD;
too, if you don't leave off your pranks;" and then the&#xD;
spinster arose, smoothed her apron, and proceeded with&#xD;
her avocations.&#xD;
Hardly were they seated at table, when Jonathan said:&#xD;
"Sister Polly, won't you set down about half a pint of&#xD;
water, and jest take the chill off."&#xD;
She rose to dot off and get it, and while she was rattling&#xD;
the tin basin against the bucket, Blush whispered aside to&#xD;
Candace:&#xD;
"He always says those very words every meal, suminer&#xD;
and winter."&#xD;
"Why don't she get it ready, if she knows she'sgot&#xD;
to?" asked Candace.&#xD;
"You mustn't put hard questions," replied Blush.&#xD;
"How do I know why women do or don't do things "&#xD;
Brother David evidently was much out of temper with&#xD;
Sister Polly's admonition, very short and gruff, contra-&#xD;
dieting and snapping at all her Bible quotations, and&#xD;
stirring the bile within her housekeeper's make-up by&#xD;
finding fault with her eatables-&#xD;
" Sass as sour as crabs; guess you looked into it, Polly!&#xD;
"No I thank you, you don't get none of that sheet-iron.&#xD;

the pot that ain't slops, I'll take it." " I dgwish you'd&#xD;

cook the salt in one pan and the sausages in t'other."&#xD;
"Fit to pizen a man by inches," and so on-and before the&#xD;
dinner was half over; the two got into a dispute about&#xD;
the fate of Old Speckle's chickens; David holding the'&#xD;
belief that they had been the prey of the tom-cat called&#xD;
' pawky," and Sister Polly as loudly setting forth her&#xD;
idea, that a fox was the thief ; and when the din got past&#xD;
bearing, Jonathan rose so slowly, that it seemed as if he&#xD;
would never be done rising, and administered a smart cuff&#xD;
to the angry disputants, who immediately subsided and&#xD;
ate 'their dinners.&#xD;
Blush frowned and grimaced aside to Candace, who&#xD;
looked frightened. "Battle-te-squirt," whispered he;&#xD;
"nobody killed, nobody hurt; they don't 'mind "-and so&#xD;
it .seemed, for that was the end of the fracas,-'and Polly,&#xD;
after muttering her favorite adjective, and'sniffing a cou..&#xD;
ple of times seemed to forget all about it.&#xD;
4fter the dishes were washed, Sister Polly dotted out,&#xD;
uabbing her hands on her apron, and said, "There now,&#xD;
them pawky things is out of the way once more, and the&#xD;
floor swep' up, and David's socks are darned to darnation,&#xD;
and I've got to go over and look after Granny Munson,&#xD;
and carry her a pie before night, when the cows must be&#xD;
milked and the hogs must be fed. Blush, he's been there&#xD;
before, so, if you've a mind to come along, I s'pose he'll&#xD;
tag after ; wont you, Blush?"&#xD;
"Certainly, Sister Polly; I shall be happy to go any-&#xD;
where with you."-&#xD;
"Soft-sawder !" replied the spinster concisely, but she&#xD;
grinned well pleased too. "Don't you b'lieve none of his&#xD;
nonsense.  He'll make you. think the moon's made of'.&#xD;
green cheese, like as not," said she aside to Candace.'&#xD;
Leading the way through a grass-grown walk, bordered&#xD;
&#xD;
with hollyhocks and corn poppies, and which branched off&#xD;
to some great flat moss-bordered stones to the tall well-&#xD;
sweep on the east, sheconveyed them through a wicket-&#xD;
gate fastened with a wooden latch, and swinging a ball&#xD;
and chain beside, like a state prisoner, which clinched it to&#xD;
a post, and ruthlessly picking up her' scanty skirts, so as to&#xD;
show a measureless reach of blue stocking, she stalked&#xD;
across the narrow road clicking amongst the pungent&#xD;
May-weeds, and driving before her a half dozen .hens,&#xD;
who scarred off with wings and feet in needless terror.&#xD;
"Sister Polly," said Blush, "why does a hen go across&#xD;
the road?"&#xD;
"'Cause she can't go round it, I s'pose."&#xD;
"Oh no ! that is not the reason," replied Blush; "it's&#xD;
because she wants to get on the other side, same as we do."&#xD;
Folly eyed the lad through her twinkling little eyes.&#xD;
"Pawky critter ; drefful smart where the skin is off.&#xD;
Ain't he, Candace?" but though her tone was sharp and&#xD;
her speech taunting, it was evident she admired him in&#xD;
the depths of her virgin soul.&#xD;
By this time they had entered a farm-house, old, weather-&#xD;
beaten,.shaky, and leaning under the weight of years.&#xD;
Candace was quite startled to behold a' staircase en-&#xD;
tirely rotted from its moorings, and cutting off the uppet&#xD;
portion of the house from the use of the inmates, and a&#xD;
big wheel tottering on the landing above her, just ready&#xD;
to tilt over upon the heads of passers below.&#xD;
Sister Polly observed.her fright. "You needn't mind,"&#xD;
said she;." that thing has been right there half a dozen&#xD;
years, and so has them old gowns hanging on the wall.&#xD;
"Granny couldn't go up the stairs,- if there was any,&#xD;
and them. things ain't worth fetchin' down no way. You&#xD;
see she's an old maid, and she's lived here alone, ever since&#xD;

GRANNY MUNSON AT HOME.&#xD;
&#xD;
the old folks died; and Aunt Ann, she lives over there,&#xD;
keeps house for Zophler, and she and me we take turns&#xD;
cleanin' on her up and chorin' for her, and mighty little&#xD;
thanks we ever get for our pains, I allow, for she is the&#xD;
ungratefullest critter ; but then we don't do it for thanks.&#xD;
'Such measure as ye meet shall be measured to you again.'&#xD;
Now Mark, he's come home. Mark Munson, he's her&#xD;
brother; but she ain't a mite better off with him than she&#xD;
was without him. They're a leetle queer. We're all&#xD;
queer ; ain't we, Candace? "&#xD;
As she looked sharply at the girl, expecting a reply,&#xD;
that young maid answered readily: "I dare say you are,&#xD;
but I know so little of people, that I am full of wonder at&#xD;
everything outside our own fences. I like you ever so&#xD;
much."&#xD;
"I brought her!" exclaimed: Blush joyfully. "She&#xD;
would'nt come for ever so long; but I stuck to it, and I&#xD;
conquered at last."&#xD;
" Why wouldn't she come?" asked Sister Polly primly.&#xD;
"You needn't a-hurt yourself, I'm sure."&#xD;
"Because I am forbidden to go abroad," Candace made&#xD;
haste to say. "I haven't stepped a foot out of the farm&#xD;
bounds before, since we came there to live. I hope you&#xD;
will let me come again if I can, " she added, throwing a&#xD;
sigh .forward into her probable reward for this excur-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
" Come whenever you want to. IJike you proper well.&#xD;
Some of the girls that come. here ain't fit for soap,&#xD;
grease" but I like you--you don't stare like a stuck pig,&#xD;
and snicker at everything I do. Didn't you feel like&#xD;
laughing when Jonathan boxed our ears ? "&#xD;
"Not a bit," answered Candace truthfully. "I suppose&#xD;
you let him, because he is your oldest .brother. Clytie is&#xD;
&#xD;

our oldest sister, and she whips us whenever she wants to,&#xD;
Orchis and me."&#xD;
"Whips you! The pawky critter !"&#xD;
"Yes, she does. I dare say she will whip me to-nilt,&#xD;
when I get home. She can't take away my day, if she&#xD;
does; so I don't care. You see I love to play, and Clytie&#xD;
doesn't, and that makes trouble. Oh my ! what's that?"&#xD;
"Only Granny Munson inside there. She gets obstrop-&#xD;
olous sometimes, and she makes noise enough to scae&#xD;
the bushes. You better look sharp how you go near her.&#xD;
She'll scratch and claw like a racoon. She'd tear your&#xD;
hair out just as soon as not, if she ketched hold on it.&#xD;
How de do Granny ?   Iere's company to visit you."&#xD;
An. old, ugly, withered. crone was Granny Munson.&#xD;
She was seated in an arm-chair, which she could hitch all&#xD;
about the room. Through being palsied in her lower&#xD;
_1 mbs, she was not able to rise or walk.&#xD;
"She's got a bag of money under that cushion, that is&#xD;
worn as smooth as glass, she has kep' it there so long,"&#xD;
explained Sister Polly in a loud voice.&#xD;
Candace felt quite shy to hear private affairs discussed&#xD;
so coolly in the presence of the person concerned, and re-&#xD;
plied in a faint whisper.&#xD;
" Oh, you needn't mind speaking up. She's as deef as&#xD;
a post," said Sister Polly; "has been these ten year."&#xD;
"How do you know they are smooth?" asked Blush,&#xD;
with true boyish desire to pin the narrator to facts.&#xD;
"Aunt Ann and I got a peep at them, last summer, one&#xD;
night when Granny was sick. She had them under her&#xD;
pillow, and the doctor give her some laudlum; and she&#xD;
slop' so sound, that for once she forgot her filthy lucre, and&#xD;
we got it out, and counted it, before she woke up ; but&#xD;

critter found it out somehow, and she wanted to claw&#xD;
our eyes out, every time we got near her, for a month&#xD;
arterward. Here's your dinner, Granny!"P&#xD;
"Ei! who be yeI what have ye come for?" cackled&#xD;
tthe crone. tacking toward her visitors. " I love childun.&#xD;
Come close up so as I can get a good look at you; my&#xD;
eyes is old and failin'."&#xD;
"Love children! yes, as a cat loves soap," put in Sister&#xD;
Polly.&#xD;
Though Candace felt afraid of her skinny, withered,&#xD;
unpleasant face, her attention was centred in her hands&#xD;
like bird-claws, which worked eagerly, hooking and un-&#xD;
hooking ; and it was well she observed them, for the old&#xD;
lady made a sudden snatch at her curls, which she only&#xD;
eluded by a quick dodge.&#xD;
"'For shame, Granny !" said Blush, " to treat a pretty&#xD;
girl so. You've scared her out of seven years' growth.&#xD;
You ought to remember when you were young and a&#xD;
beauty yourself.  See the nice pie we've- brought&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Have her next time ! have her next time!" mumbled&#xD;
Granny, ending the eldrich chant with a screech like a&#xD;
poll-parrot;and a swift tack in the other direction.&#xD;
The shriek was her reception of a new visitor, Uncle&#xD;
Zopher, Aunt Ann's brother, whom Granny hated on ac-&#xD;
count of an, accident which had happened to her through&#xD;
him a long time ago, but which she never forgot.&#xD;
A couple of years before he had carried her to Cherry&#xD;
Brook in an old lumber wagon with a drop end, and on&#xD;
returning he stopped to water his horses in the ford.&#xD;
When he started up the team, their sudden spring tilted&#xD;
down the drop, and out went the back seat with its help-&#xD;
less burden 'into the water. Poor Granny being thus&#xD;
&#xD;
abruptly disposed-of on a mossy rock, in water up to her&#xD;
chin, like Mistress Mouse who married the frog who&#xD;
would a-wooing go, whether his mother~would let him or&#xD;
no, shrieked and skreeled herself hoarse to no purpose.&#xD;
Uncle Zopher being perfectly deaf, and having no love&#xD;
for the old lady which should incline him to turn back-&#xD;
ward and behold her, jogged comfortably home, and drew&#xD;
up before the farmhouse gate. Aunt Ann and Sister&#xD;
Polly came-out to care for the cripple, and .reinstate lher&#xD;
in her arm-chair, and after a survey of the establishment,&#xD;
screamed in his ear:&#xD;
" Where's Granny Munson?"&#xD;
"The devil ! I. don't know vhat's become of her," an-&#xD;
.swered Zopher, when their united gesticulations and hoot-&#xD;
ings had pointed out the deficit in 'his load.&#xD;
Retracing his steps they found her -scratching and&#xD;
clawing in the pool, and out of breath with shouting,;&#xD;
and she put all their limbs in jeopardy while they lifted&#xD;
her back to her place ; and to say she hated Uncle&#xD;
Zopher, who always stretched his mouth behind a wipe&#xD;
of his hand when the misfortune was alluded to, and&#xD;
shook slightly inside, would- be using faint words to de-&#xD;
scribe Granny Munson's emotions toward her careless&#xD;
chaperon.&#xD;
"lHe's after my little money. Zopher, he's a thief!&#xD;
Mark, come here. Oh, where's Mark'? He'll help me&#xD;
keep the bag safe. ie want's to steal it himself. Oh,&#xD;
Mark can't come ; he's gone!"&#xD;
"Where is'he.put out to, Granny?" asked Sister&#xD;
Polly.&#xD;
" To.sell his hair to the barber," squealed the cripple,&#xD;
laughing and coughing. ." He let it grow long a purpose&#xD;
and now he's gone to .get his money for it. Mark, he's&#xD;

won't let Zopher get my money."&#xD;
"'The meanest critter," explained Sister Polly.' When&#xD;
he fixed up the old barn after he came, he kep' watch of&#xD;
the pigeons for fear they'd swaller the gravel, because&#xD;
he meant to sell dirt."&#xD;
"When did he come? " asked Blush.  I never heard&#xD;
anything about him before."&#xD;
"No, he has been gone years and years, but all to&#xD;
once he turned up like a grave-stun. Here he comes.&#xD;
How de do, Mark?"&#xD;
A down-looking, surly-faced fellow, mean in person&#xD;
and dress, whose very legs looked mean; they twisted&#xD;
and shambled, as if used to stumbling through evil&#xD;
ways. He had been a cat-killing, dog-worrying boy, who&#xD;
shirked work, played truant, lied, stole apples, bullied&#xD;
small children-a sneaking, pilfering youth; and after a&#xD;
barn-burning, which ought, to have shut him up, he de-&#xD;
camped, disappearing entirely for years and years.&#xD;
Some said he had learned the discipline of the galleys;&#xD;
and there was a tale afloat of wild life among Hottento.ts&#xD;
and cannibals; but at any rate, he had appearedfor a&#xD;
few days about five years back, with a little handful of&#xD;
money (which he, soon gambled away), many wrinkles,&#xD;
and now here he was again, broken-down, ill-tempered,&#xD;
moody, the upshot of his boyhood. He managed tolive&#xD;
with his sister, profiting by the kindness of her friends,&#xD;
who would not see an old neighbor starve, and pleading&#xD;
poverty to every call for his portion of the expenses.&#xD;
"Oh, visitors," said Mark, shuffling and backing. " I&#xD;
didn't know. A poor place to come to. We're poor&#xD;
folks; old and poor."&#xD;
" Never mind going ovtbr all that lingo now, Mark,"&#xD;
&#xD;

said Sister Polly; "we've -got it by heart a'ready. - Your&#xD;
looks show what you be, plain enough. This is Blush&#xD;
Beach, and this is, oh what a pawky critter I am to forgot&#xD;
names!"&#xD;
"Candace Dunwreath," said Blush.&#xD;
"Oh, to be sure, this is Candace Inunwreath, one of&#xD;
the old maids-"&#xD;
"Who d d you say? " asked Mark, stopping short and&#xD;
peering out from under .his eyebrows. " I'm a leetle&#xD;
hard o' hearin'."&#xD;
"Candace Dunwreath, I tell you," shouted Sister&#xD;
Polly; "lives on the Gibson Place. Why, what ails the&#xD;
old fool ?" she added, giving him a poke, calculated to&#xD;
double him  up; "make a bow when you stand afore&#xD;
white folks. There now I"&#xD;
"Quit o' that, Polly Pember," answered Mark, angrily.&#xD;
It's time for you to be leavin'-off your monkey shines;&#xD;
making' so free with tie ster ier sex, prancin' round and&#xD;
teeterin' so, that a man can't Ifind a quiet place in his own&#xD;

Pulling a chair into a corner hg tilted his old hat&#xD;
down over his eyes, and looked around him on the floor&#xD;
as if he had lost something ; only raising his face when&#xD;
Candace spoke, and then -finding her eyes fixed on&#xD;
him in fascinated wonder, he 'slouched quickly, and&#xD;
moved hither and thither, peering anxiously on either&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"What are you looking for ?" asked Blush, rising to&#xD;
assist the search. "Let me help yon."&#xD;
"You help me!" said Mark, shrinking into himself&#xD;
and turning pale ; "you and her!"&#xD;
" I believe you two are pizen to him," said Sister Polly:&#xD;
" He looks as if he seen a ghost!"&#xD;

"Who talks of ghosts?" screamed Mark. "There&#xD;

"Shut up yourself, and see .how you like it," retorted&#xD;
Sister Polly. "Only tell us what you're everlastingly'&#xD;
speering at on the floor."&#xD;
"I'm looking for-a pin," answered Mark, who had&#xD;
dropped his eyes and was continuing his search.&#xD;
"A fiddlestick! I'll tell you, hers looking for his hon-&#xD;
esty that he dropped hereabouts. forever ago."&#xD;
"You're a nagging old maid; there's no peace with&#xD;
you," said Mark, rising and shambling towards the door,&#xD;
but turning there to take a parting look at Candace.&#xD;
"Where's you cuttin' to now?" called out Sister&#xD;
Polly, who seemed to cover all his motions with her&#xD;
little sharp eyes.&#xD;
He snarled back something about feeding the hogs,&#xD;
and they heard him hurriedly clatter over the boards of&#xD;
the loose floor, and bang the door behind him.&#xD;
" He has taken a skunner at you, I guess," said Zopher&#xD;
smiling to Candace. "He don't like to have the girls&#xD;
look at him; he's modest."&#xD;
"I didn't mean to," replied Candace, "but he was so&#xD;
queer, I couldn't help it. You musn't mind what I do,&#xD;
because Blush has never taken me out a-visiting before,&#xD;
and I don't know just how to behave. I shall get used&#xD;
to thingsafter a while. I hope I didn't drive Mr.-Mr.&#xD;
what's-his-name away?"&#xD;
"Not so fur but what he'll come back agin," spoke up&#xD;
Sister Polly; "no such good news. A bad penny that is,&#xD;
sure to return, the stingy old batch. There's enough of&#xD;
the same sort left round here. If more of 'em should&#xD;
take it into their noddles to put out, 'twould be good rid-&#xD;

"That's where the shoe pinches," explained Zopher;&#xD;
who by following closely Sister Polly's lips had caught&#xD;
her meaning, and who seemed to take pleasure in teazing&#xD;
his neighbor; "she's mad 'cause nobody don't spark her&#xD;
in their store clothes Sunday nights. Come, own up, Sis-&#xD;
ter Polly."&#xD;
"Why didn't you ever get married?" asked Blush.&#xD;
"You're good-looking."&#xD;
"'Cause Zopher Patterby was the only feller that ever&#xD;
asked me, and I wouldn't set long side the pawky critter&#xD;
at no price ; that's why."&#xD;
"Brace up and waggle him," exclaimed Blush, clap-&#xD;
ping his hands in great glee. "How are you feeling&#xD;
now, Uncle Zopher?"&#xD;
"A leetle slim, Blush, that's a fact. You see these old&#xD;
maids, they get sharper and sharper; their noses and&#xD;
their tongues does. You'd best take warning, Miss,&#xD;
and get married afore all the blood in your pooty cheeks&#xD;
turns to vinegar like."&#xD;
"Oh, she'll do that fast enough. She's had a couple of&#xD;
offers to-day."&#xD;
Candace laughed and looked at her stiff with its two&#xD;
names nicely carved upon it, which she had been very&#xD;
careful not to let out of her sight.&#xD;
-After giving Granny Munson her dinner, freshening&#xD;
up the old place, setting things to rights, while Blush&#xD;
Beach helped Uncle Zopher split and fetch in a nice pile&#xD;
of wood in the corner, they bade the cripple good-by.&#xD;
"That lazy varmint would let Granny freeze to death,&#xD;
I do swan, afore he'd tote a stick," said Zopher. "Not&#xD;
that I mind doin' it; tain't worth speakin' of no way;&#xD;
but I do hate to see a man so plaguy shiftless."&#xD;
" Come back, come back," called out Granny Munson,&#xD;

as-they left her, "till I tell you something. I was once&#xD;
the handsomest gall in all. Cherry Brook. Now my&#xD;
teeth's gone, my eyes is blind, my ears ain't good for&#xD;
nothin', and I ain't fit for nothing' but the worms, nor&#xD;
hardly that."&#xD;
Candace shuddered, as she listened and watched the&#xD;
mopping and mowing of the hideous old creature.&#xD;
"I think it is dreadful to grow old," she whispered to&#xD;
Blpsh. "I don't want to get like that; she makes me&#xD;
afraid."&#xD;
" No more will you, child ; don't mind her. She was&#xD;
a beauty in her time-folks called her the wild rose, and&#xD;
wild enough she was. She don't suffer half so much as&#xD;
she deserves, for she was wickeder than she was pretty.&#xD;
The fool that wanted her hung himself up chamber ; I&#xD;
helped to cut him down; she didn't seem to care a mite.&#xD;
You just go by the Good Book and be a nice gall, and&#xD;
you'll be happy. 'Remember now thy Creator in the&#xD;

Candace looked very sober and thoughtful after they&#xD;
got away. Blush quite outdid himself in pranks to&#xD;
amuse her ; nobody ,escaped, not even Sister Polly and&#xD;
Uncle Zopher, whom he watched his opportunity to shut&#xD;
into the cheese-room, from which the rigid spinster&#xD;
emerged blushing, feeling- of her comb, and settling her&#xD;
neck into her gown, and as she made a dive and dab at&#xD;
the lad's ears, she exclaimed:&#xD;
" Oh, you pawky critter! "&#xD;
Blush clapped his hands.. "BEnlly for you, Uncle&#xD;
Zopher! " screamed he. " You kissed her in there, didn't&#xD;
you ?&#xD;
To which soft impeachment the old fellow replied with&#xD;
a winl and a rub of his hands.&#xD;

time, and we'll have ,a wedding. She's a'most ready."&#xD;
"Get along, you old batch!" retorted Sister Polly,&#xD;
flouting him. " You must think I'm soft."&#xD;
Candace looked from one to. the other, and she some-&#xD;
how felt sure that the spinster did incline to the man de-&#xD;
spite her vixenish treatment of him ; and she thought&#xD;
she would sometime ask her why she had refused him in&#xD;
her youth, and chosen to live all her life at odds with&#xD;
him. She wished to hear a love story. You see all&#xD;
womanhood is the same; the knowledge and apprecia-&#xD;
tion of such matters is intuitive : as natural as their&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
"You'll come, won't you'?" continued Zopher. "It will&#xD;
be as I tell you., I'll have her afore the year is out, and&#xD;
we will have a little sing at the doing's. Do you know&#xD;
Balermy?"&#xD;
"If she don't she can learn it, Uncle Zopher. You&#xD;
persevere. I see consent in Sister Polly's eyes (Candace&#xD;
wondered where, for to her they looked only sharp as&#xD;
gimlets). I'll bring Candace sure."&#xD;
"That's the cheese, Blush! I used to play the bass-viol&#xD;
till that buzz-saw jumped up and bit off my finger. But&#xD;
it didn't bite off my voice. I can sing with the best of&#xD;
'em."&#xD;
After a nice wing in the great butternut, while they&#xD;
devoured Siste Polly's card gingerbread, and she called&#xD;
Zopher names and declared she "wouldn't wipe her old&#xD;
shoes on him," and he smoked his pipe in .happy uncon-&#xD;
sciousness, Blush reminded his companion that the day&#xD;
was waning.&#xD;

such a good time. I don't mind being an old maid any&#xD;
more, Sister Polly."&#xD;
"Aunt Ann does. It makes her hopping. She wants&#xD;
to be called' single lady,"'remarked the spinster.&#xD;
"You are coming out of the ranks before long, you&#xD;
know," laughed Blush. "Hurry up your melon-patch."&#xD;
"What a bundle of nonsense a boy can be," answered&#xD;
Sister Polly, turning her back on her favorite.  "You&#xD;
shall come again," she added to Candace, "and I'll show&#xD;
you how to make burr baskets and cone frames."&#xD;
As they were shutting the gate, Candace caught sight&#xD;
of Mark slouching behind a clump of lilacs, who, after a&#xD;
sharp inquisitive look at her, edged off, saying to himself:&#xD;
"Help me, them two!. Dunwreaths round here ain't&#xD;
healthy."&#xD;
"What a dreadful looking man that Mark is," said she.&#xD;
"I wish I hadn't seen him. I feel as if he looked like&#xD;
the devil."&#xD;
"Take care Candace; don't be profane," laughed Blush.&#xD;
"He is not a beauty. I wonder what ails his ankle, that he&#xD;
keeps that handkerchief tied around it, and how queer he&#xD;
walks, don't he ?"&#xD;
In all the pauses in their talk, Candace's thoughts went&#xD;
back to the mean, slouching fellow, and Blush' said at&#xD;
last, that she "must not remember him any more, because&#xD;
he would be sure to plague( her dreams."&#xD;
Having put up the bars behind the last of her cows,&#xD;
she stopped to say a farewell word -to Blush, and thank&#xD;
him for her great pleasure and her good staff.&#xD;
"I shall always remember what you said about it,"&#xD;
said she, passing her hand tenderly over the carving.&#xD;
"1And some day you will ask me to add the sweetheart.&#xD;
I am ready as soon as you like," replied .he laughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Before she had time to look up at him, she heard Oly-&#xD;
tie's voice in the horse-barn, where she was feeding the&#xD;
team after their hard day's work, which duty she per-&#xD;
formed without a pat or caress, or needless word to the&#xD;
honest beasts, who had. discharged so faithfully the task&#xD;
required of them.&#xD;
Somehow life seemed harder and more grinding than&#xD;
she had ever felt it before, as she turnedher back on her&#xD;
friend, and.set her face toward the stillness and restraints&#xD;
of her home.&#xD;

when a look in her eyes held back the words. Still, as the&#xD;
Bertha wrought on, and the hum soothed' her, the was&#xD;
fuller of her own thoughts than of Orchis' feelings, though&#xD;
she loved her very dearly.&#xD;
"This is a big world," said she at length. "I don't feel&#xD;
as if I could ever be content to stay inside our fences,:like&#xD;
our lambs in their fold, any more."&#xD;
"Then you will get eaten up some day by a wicked&#xD;
wolf, like the silly thing in our primer. But -how came&#xD;
you to venture ? I feel frightened at iou!"&#xD;
"I told you I should have to go along with Blush. -You&#xD;
know how often he has begged me.. Do you think I have&#xD;
done wrong, Orchis, dear? I tried, but I really could not&#xD;
let him go off without following him," said Candace, a'&#xD;
little fretfully.&#xD;
"Not wrong at all, pet. I shall not stop forever here&#xD;
myself. We are not rooted in the ground, like cabbages."&#xD;
"Oh, I am so glad you don't blame me; and see what&#xD;
I have got. I am always to keep it, and anytime I like,&#xD;
I can get 'Sweetheart' carved on it. Blush Beach stands&#xD;
ready to be it too! He -told me so to-day."&#xD;
Orchis heaved a sigh as she listened to the history of&#xD;
the good staff, and she felt a little secret bitterness, "why&#xD;
have I not a'friend? why is Candace, my little sister, so,&#xD;
much luckier than I? ". which thoughts she fought down&#xD;
and kept to herself.&#xD;
".I suppose Clytie will whip me, when she finds my&#xD;
work not done. I must bear it as well as I can, but, oh&#xD;
dear, I am so tired of being beaten and doing what I&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN THE WOOD-HOUSE CHAMBER.&#xD;
&#xD;
ROIIIS was spinning in the wood-house chamber,&#xD;
. and Candace, catching the buzz of her wheel,&#xD;
mounted' the stairs, and hastening in, she th'ew&#xD;
herself wearily upon the bunches of wool in the corner,&#xD;
without saying a word.&#xD;
"Where did you. hide yourself, pet ? " asked Orchis.&#xD;
"Did you fall asleep in the woods, or lose your way&#xD;
among the elders?  I was hurrying up my stent that I&#xD;
might slip off in search of you."&#xD;
"-Neither, sister Orchis, dear. I have done something&#xD;
wonderful; I've been outside the farm! I've been pay-&#xD;
ing a visit to some people he knows, with Blush Beach.&#xD;
Orchis' face fell. A sad feeling would drop upon&#xD;
her, whenever her .sister talked about her boy friend,&#xD;
though she ti-ied to drive it off, and would not for the&#xD;
world have let Candace see it,-a shut out' loneliness,&#xD;
which made her life chillier-and drearier than ever ; and&#xD;
as she stepped steadily up and down, pulling out the soft&#xD;
rolls, and spindling her yarn, Candace chafed at the sight,&#xD;
remembering how Sister Polly dotted and limped around&#xD;
her place in consequence-of a life of the same humdrum&#xD;
work,.and she was just going to speak about it to Orchis,&#xD;

&#xD;
Candacedlooked up inserprie. There was such a hard&#xD;
ring sin her darling Orchis' ,voice, that it sounded like&#xD;
Clytie's own, and she was sure she was thinking how selfish&#xD;
and thoughtless she had been to load her with two labors.&#xD;
"Don't be angry, Orchis," said she. "You are so good&#xD;
to save me from the horrid whipping ! so good, to me-&#xD;
always I I couldn't live, if Orchis did not pet and love&#xD;
me.&#xD;
&#xD;
The spinner wound up a couple of rolls, and walked&#xD;
backward and forward two or three times, before she&#xD;
stopped her humming wheel with the wooden 'pin she car-&#xD;
ried, and coming down to the, curly head, she took it in&#xD;
her hands, and kissed the beseeching face half a dozen&#xD;
times.&#xD;
"Now you tell ie what you saw," said she. Her eyes,&#xD;
were clear and sweet, and her voice low and soft, and&#xD;
Candace threw her arms around her neck and returned&#xD;
her caress warmly.'&#xD;
"Dear Orchis ! good .Orchis ! I hope I shall never,&#xD;
never make you sorry a minute in your whole life. Not&#xD;
now; I can't talk here; wait till we are in bed, where no'&#xD;
one can hear our whispering; there is so much of it, and&#xD;
I am sure you will like it."&#xD;

CHAPTER XL&#xD;
&#xD;
"'THERE'S NAE ROOM FOR TwA.&#xD;
HE hours were always early at the farm, and after&#xD;
supper, Clytie went to her room, or out to the&#xD;
grave under the wailing pines, where she passed&#xD;
most of the fine evenings of the year, and someof the&#xD;
stormy ones; never failing to carry there each day an&#xD;
offering of fresh flowers,, which she placed reverently&#xD;
above the' breast of the sleeper, with whom she held&#xD;
voiceless converse at all times, and to whom she often&#xD;
spoke aloud thoughts which found utterance nowhere&#xD;
else. Only a low slab of white marble, pure and unwritten,&#xD;
marked the 'resting-place of the unfortunate man, who&#xD;
stood to her as a martyr, and whose bitter end she never&#xD;
for one moment forgot; whose cruel sufferings she still&#xD;
bore in her .own body; whose soul-presence she felt con-&#xD;
tinually.&#xD;
The others were thus left to spend their evenings to=&#xD;
gether, and those were te only hours which at all&#xD;
approached sociability among these girls, so isolated, so&#xD;
cut off from their kind.&#xD;
Griselda and Vashti, the twins, had commonly some&#xD;
concurrent interest, something to say about their patch-&#xD;
work, knitting, or the fruit they dried for market, and&#xD;

&#xD;
occasionally the taxidermist invited the others to view:&#xD;
her collection of birds and reptiles; but being so much&#xD;
older than the two "children," the seniors insensibly&#xD;
paired off, a pairing which was assisted by the fact, that&#xD;
they two occupied the same apartment, as did the younger&#xD;
ones.&#xD;
Goody Ruddoek rose with the - dawn, and after each'&#xD;
hard day's work she was tired enough to .get to- sleep&#xD;
with her chickens, and her cares culminated in the lock-&#xD;
ing of the gates, and a general going over and through&#xD;
the place, making sure that no man or other intruding&#xD;
., animal had gained admittance to her fold, to endanger her&#xD;
beloved charge; and while Goody slept, the great blood-&#xD;
hound, Toss, patrolled the enclosure, watching every leaf&#xD;
that dropped, giving quick ear to every hum and murmur&#xD;
which broke the lull of the hushed night.&#xD;
As soon as they were by themselves and snuggled in&#xD;
each other's arms, Candace began to talk, going over&#xD;
every occurrence of her day, which dwelt in her memory&#xD;
with the vividness of fresh, new experiences. Every word&#xD;
she heard, each face, all the utensils and surroundings, she&#xD;
brought before.Orchis in their own shapes, and she dwelt,&#xD;
on the kind friendliness of Blush, winding up with this&#xD;
bit of information:&#xD;
".He says he will certainly come and ask Clytie to let&#xD;
me go to the paring-bee, and if he does, and she consents,&#xD;
you shall come too, dear Orchis, for I cannot fully enjoy&#xD;
any pleasure which you do not share."&#xD;
"What is a paring-bee? " asked Orchis, parrying the'&#xD;
concluding statement for some reason of her own, and in&#xD;
a little cool tone quite unusual with her.&#xD;
"An evening when they do up apples to dry, as we do&#xD;
ours, only they have lively, pleasant times. All the neigh&#xD;
&#xD;
bors go, and after they have finished the work, they have&#xD;
a sprightly frolic. Oh, how much better it must be, than&#xD;
to plod and poke, as we are forced to do, where every one&#xD;
is so sober, that I can't get a laugh even from you, Orchis,&#xD;
and Glytie whips us, if we loiter or sport a bit. I want to&#xD;
see it ; I want to be in it ! I feel it must be such fun 1":&#xD;
4Fun you and I will not soon see, pet. You know for&#xD;
sure, that Clytie will not listen to any such proposal."&#xD;
"She shall listen, Orchis! I will go,! As you say, we&#xD;
are not cabbages; we are live girls; we can't fare on so!&#xD;
You know it!. you feel it! I'd rather be a potato, and&#xD;
get boiled! a chicken and get plucked! a pig and get&#xD;
baked! I'll jump out of the window !I'll steal off!"said&#xD;
Candace passionately.&#xD;
"Oh, pet ! " answered Orchis in faint wonder, "how&#xD;
it has kindled you up, this one friend, this one day. You&#xD;
used to be satisfied with my love. That will never be again;,&#xD;
will it? Come, let's go to sleep now, and don't dream of&#xD;
Blush, and forget that my arm is around you"&#xD;
"Forget! oh no, Orchis, we will both have him for our&#xD;
friend. He shall be yours as much as mine."&#xD;
"You remind me of Goody's old song, pet: 'There is&#xD;
nae room for twa.' In such friendships I think there is&#xD;
no room for a third, sae I maun walk behind, pet. I&#xD;
maun walk behind. Well, let it be as it must. Kiss me,&#xD;
sweet. You are mine to-night, ny dear little sister. Good.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
&#xD;
ONLY A WOMAN.&#xD;
'HE next day was scouring time in the milk-room,&#xD;
Orchis and Candace were busy brightening the&#xD;
pans, scrubbing the bowls, scalding the earthen&#xD;
pots, until they culminated their labors by dipping cool&#xD;
water from the spring in the corner, which they dashed&#xD;
and splashed over the stone floor, and then swept and&#xD;
wept, until it was dry and shining, and the whole place.&#xD;
sweet and fresh as the cowslips in their meadows.&#xD;
Candace had hindered herself a good deal by peeping&#xD;
through the vine-clad windows, which looked toward the&#xD;
gate, and Orchis had also come more than once, and&#xD;
gazed thoughtfully out over her sister's shoulder, as if she&#xD;
were trying to see the true path into the large life they&#xD;
desired; and though their talk had been of the boy&#xD;
Blush and the unknown joy, called a paring-bee, and their&#xD;
mutual.longings and must-haves, it all seemed so vision-&#xD;
ary and impossible, that they were so startled as to turn&#xD;
pale and clasp each other's hands, when they heard' a&#xD;
hearty voice shouting out a spirited greeting to Clytie.&#xD;
She had unlocked the gate and stepped outside to pull&#xD;
some wandering lupins, which had dared to take root and&#xD;
bloom at their own sweet will amongst the grass and&#xD;
weeds of the road-side.&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good afternoon, Miss Dtwreark! I've conae to ask a&#xD;
favor of you."&#xD;
Through the opening they could see their sister stoop-&#xD;
ing at her work, and also hear the low growl of the dog&#xD;
Toss, who kept close at her side. They held their breath&#xD;
for her reply, but they waited in vain, for the worker'paid&#xD;
no heed to him, and methodically continued her occupa-&#xD;
tion, placing the unearthed plants side by side in. her bas-&#xD;
ket.&#xD;
"A favor, Miss Olytie," continued lush, pulling off his&#xD;
cap and bowing, "a very great favor. We are going to&#xD;
have a paring-bee, and I want Miss Candace to come.&#xD;
Clytie rose slowly and stood erect, -having finished her&#xD;
labors, and confrointed the eager boy, flushed with the&#xD;
-excitement of the long projected conversation, to which&#xD;
he had been dared by Efrie, and which had been the sub-&#xD;
ject of so many conjectures, prophesyings, and warnings&#xD;
among his five aunties.&#xD;
They say she carries a pistol; I am afraid she'll shoot&#xD;
you," said Arabella. "She will make her great dog'&#xD;
cJhaw you up," said Elevir, a little provincial in her Engr&#xD;
lish. "The Tom-big-one will toss-you over the fence and&#xD;
break all your bones, like the Ogre of the den," said Gy-&#xD;
net. "Do be persuaded not to go," pleaded Margery;&#xD;
"they are infidels." "Jacky wouldn't, because lie dared&#xD;
not," laughed Efwie; and that clinched a resolution strong&#xD;
enough before.&#xD;
While he looked at Olytie holding a bunch of lupins in&#xD;
her hand, he tried to say to himself: " Only a woman!&#xD;
the world is full of them. My father told me they were&#xD;
our inferiors, made for our pleasure," and so on. He&#xD;
could not repress a slight shudder.  he looked .so mar-&#xD;
blerstill, so apart every way, yet so wonderful in her re-&#xD;

pellent beauty that'the lad's gaze was fastened upon her,&#xD;
and a feeling, half hate, half dread, role up in his heart,&#xD;
subtle, inexplainable, born of her eyes, deep and black,&#xD;
which her first words condensed into an impatient antag-&#xD;
onism.&#xD;
"'As you have a. right to the high road, you will do&#xD;
well to use it, because if you stop here where you' trespass,&#xD;
I shall give you in charge to Toss, who you see is both&#xD;
willing and able to undertake the business." ,&#xD;
A tall hound with cream-colored hide and bright liver&#xD;
spots confronted the youth, and her large eyes full of,&#xD;
red veins looked her eagerness, as well as her heavy jaws&#xD;
supported her power, to finish what .she undertook; but&#xD;
Blush had high physical courage, and he stood his ground&#xD;
bravely; though it was odd, that while he answered, un-&#xD;
consciously avoiding the woman's gaze, he plainly saw it,&#xD;
and the soft flaxen hair, which parted like floss from a&#xD;
clear white line in the centre of her head and caressed&#xD;
hersears, lightly shading them as if refusing to be kept in&#xD;
prison bonds; and he heard the fall of the gray shaker&#xD;
upon the ground when she rose, erect, and careless of it,&#xD;
and the wind sweeping across her face.&#xD;
"Now, Miss Clytie, what good would it do you to set&#xD;
your dog on a peaceable lad (she does wear a pistol; there&#xD;
it is now sticking in her belt). If you do, I shall defend&#xD;
myself as well as I can, and as I am outside your yard,&#xD;
you cannot order me off, and you will be punished by the&#xD;
law, as well as hated by all decent folks for being so&#xD;
blood-thirsty to a fellow, who would be glad to be a good&#xD;
neighbor, and have a bit of fun with your small sister.&#xD;
I'm sure she will say 'yes' to our frolic, if youtwill per-&#xD;

take all sorts of care of her."&#xD;

"You do well to speak to me of laws; I know all&#xD;
about their wisdom and justice."&#xD;
" I believe you, Miss Clytie ! of course you know lots&#xD;
that I have forgotten: I mean, that I never heard of.&#xD;
Thank you, so. I will just step in and see Candace, and&#xD;
bid her to the bee. I like to attend to those little things&#xD;
myself. Who, was it who said, he'd go forty miles to see&#xD;
a man, before he'd write him a letter? I feel just so&#xD;
about giving invites,-I like to look at the girls, when I.&#xD;
ask them. I can tell whether they mean to coie or will&#xD;
give me the mitten.-I never did see such bright posies!&#xD;
how red and yellow they are! Oh, there she is, I see her !&#xD;
-mad I go up and do my errand?2."&#xD;
" Nof!"&#xD;
"What!, not just half a dozen wordsV nothing private,&#xD;
Miss Clytie. You are welcome to hear every sentence."&#xD;
As Blush took couple of steps toward the gate, Toss&#xD;
growled and Clytie said: "If you persist in intruding I&#xD;
shall order the dog to take care of you. You see what&#xD;
she is; there she stands!"&#xD;
"But what sort of a woman are you!" exclaimed Blush,&#xD;
in spite of himself, meeting the black eyes, "to talk of&#xD;
having me murdered in a still voice and with such a face&#xD;
as that ! Are you not human, like other folks? You&#xD;
have no right to keep the little girl a prisoner, and beat&#xD;
her as you do. I will see her ; you shall not hinder me!"&#xD;
he finished with a sense of intense irritation, kindled by&#xD;
the dead fire of her look, so emotionless, so lacking in&#xD;
human sympathy.&#xD;
Whether Toss obeyed a motion of Olytie's hand, or&#xD;
considered the conversation to have arrived at the proper&#xD;
point 'for"her interference, she sprang forward with a&#xD;
deep bark, and Blush had a chance to need all his activ-&#xD;

ity and nimbleness, when brute force had so much the&#xD;
best of it.&#xD;
It might be interesting to note the quick passage of&#xD;
thoughts through the human brain, and how many are&#xD;
able to revolve around a point of time. Blush wished a&#xD;
good number of wishes, many more than he took breaths,&#xD;
while the dog was dashing at him ; as, for instance, that&#xD;
Clytie was better tempered; that he had a good stout&#xD;
club (and he' also remembered the' staff he had orna-&#xD;
mented for Candace, but which still lacked the 'sweet-&#xD;
heart'); that the brute would drop in a fit; that he, Blush,&#xD;
was safe at home; that he was inside the high board fence&#xD;
around Candace, and Toss out,; that his friend Precious&#xD;
Plunket was at hand. But a wish for the help which was&#xD;
close by never fluttered among his desires.&#xD;
Ajax was the help. Ajax who shoved his huge self&#xD;
through the gate, and after a snarl'at his arch enemy, a&#xD;
survey of the belligerent parties, and a hasty smell at&#xD;
Blush's clothing, he threw himself upon the blood-hound's&#xD;
neck, burning to avenge his own injuries as well as de._&#xD;
fend the friend-lie had adopted for dear love of his fellow-&#xD;
sufferer, Candace; and once his blood up, even Clytie's&#xD;
dreaded voice would have had no power over him; but a&#xD;
statue of ice could not have been more impassive during&#xD;
the struggle of the animals.&#xD;
It looked almost as if Ajax took a leaf out of his&#xD;
antagonist's book, for he dashed at once into her favorite&#xD;
mode of attack, and pinned her throat the first lunge.&#xD;
The two beasts rolled over and over in arough-and-tum-&#xD;
ble, noisy fight. It was quite plain from the inflaming&#xD;
nature of the vociferations they bandied, that they were&#xD;
using the strongest Saxon in their' language to describe&#xD;
each other, and their states of mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
Candace and Orchis, who had been drawing gradually&#xD;
near and nearer to the forbidden gate, put their heads&#xD;
out just as they :closed, and Candace forgot everything&#xD;
but love and fear for her favorite.&#xD;
"Oh, my dear Ajax!" screamed she, rushing upon&#xD;
him, and vainly trying to part the combatants with her.&#xD;
girl-strength.  "Horrid Toss! 0 Blush, don't let her&#xD;
kill my dear good Ajax. Help me Orchis; do take her&#xD;
off!&#xD;
As she was tugging Toss by the tail with her feet well&#xD;
braced and at her arm's length, she got a tumble, for the&#xD;
bloodhound fell back, wounded and powerless. Ajax&#xD;
had put his sharp teeth quite through the big artery in&#xD;
her neck, and both were stained with her hot, spirting&#xD;
blood. As the enemy ceased to struggle, the conquei-or&#xD;
considered his work finished, and with a parting snap of&#xD;
his. jaws lie left her and crept whining to Blush's feet,&#xD;
who had entirely lost his headdaring the quick following&#xD;
charges of the affray, upon which Clytie gazed without&#xD;
passion or pity, holding the lupines looseW grasped in.&#xD;
her small fist, and the other hand hanging by her side,&#xD;
like a statue of insouciance.&#xD;
And nov appeared a new actor-Vashti-who strode&#xD;
quickly down the garden-walk, and after an instant's sur-&#xD;
vey of all parties, she stooped and felt the dog's wound;&#xD;
then dragged her ruthlessly by her collar to the horse-&#xD;
barn, where she picked up and tied the gashed artery in&#xD;
a fervor of surgical enjoyment; and having bound up-&#xD;
the place with the proper cataplasm, she tossed her on a&#xD;
bed of straw and left her.&#xD;
As soon as it was really over, Candace remembered&#xD;
where she was, and after a frightened look at the marble&#xD;
beauty of her sister's face, and a piteous glance at Blush,&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
she .stole in, followed by Qrchis, who had scarcely re-&#xD;
moved her eyes from Olytie all the while. Ajax was in&#xD;
a puzzle at first, being divided between his allegiance to&#xD;
his boy-friend and his girl playfellow ; but the old prefer-&#xD;
ence at length got the better of him, especially as he re-&#xD;
ceived no encouragement from Blush, and after wagging&#xD;
his tail and licking his bloody jaws, as he whined up to&#xD;
the lad, he turned his eyes on, Clytie, and then whisked&#xD;
through the gate, galloping after the children.&#xD;
So the youth was left tete--tete with Olytie, and the&#xD;
first thing he did was to pick up her shaker and politely&#xD;
offer itto its owner ; stammering a good deal of apology,&#xD;
entreaty, explanation, propitiation, and hope for the fu-&#xD;
ture. He might have saved his breath. She wheeled&#xD;
slowly about without once looking at him, walked inside&#xD;
the gate, and presently he heard her turn the key, which&#xD;
locked hin out of his great expectations.&#xD;

ORCHIS MAKES UP HER MIND.&#xD;
&#xD;
/  HE young girls had reached the milk-room, and&#xD;
were exchanging scared whispers, when Clytie&#xD;
overtook them.&#xD;
"You have been talking with this fellow it seems,&#xD;
Candace," said she, "since you know his name, and he&#xD;
dares call you by yours so familiarly."&#xD;
' He talked with me first. He was sorry for me the day&#xD;
you .beat me and Ajax. He was looking through the&#xD;
fence and saw it all," said Candace, while Orchis, who&#xD;
had never heard the girl speak so firmly before, examined&#xD;
her carefully, wondering and half-guessing where she&#xD;
got her daring. "It is born of her new friendship, she&#xD;
is not afraid now, because she is known and sought by a&#xD;
boy who will soon be' a man. He inspires her with Ai8&#xD;
courage," was her conclusion.&#xD;
"He will have a chance to be what you call 'sorry'&#xD;
again, if you again disobey. Do you understand?"&#xD;
" Oh, yes! I understand-whipping-I have been faith-&#xD;
fully taught; but Blush Beach is very nice and friendly,&#xD;
and I want a friend so much."&#xD;
"And you also, Orchis;' you shared this transgression;&#xD;
you have also gained a friend?"&#xD;

It is impossible to describe the metallic ring pf Olytie's&#xD;
voice, so harsh, so inclement, so mocking.&#xD;
"I have no friends, Clytie," answered Orchis; raising&#xD;
eyes, deep.as Olytie's own with their fathomless blue, and&#xD;
meeting full those which pitilessly scanned her.  I have&#xD;
neither sought nor found such a bliss, such a glory and&#xD;
richness. If I were sure I could certainly attain unto&#xD;
it, I would never lose a moment till I began the-search,&#xD;
nor cease till I compassed it."&#xD;
Clytie did not for one instant remove her gaze from&#xD;
her young sister, though whatever the charm might be&#xD;
which held her, appeared not. Pretty soon she turned to&#xD;
Candace:&#xD;
" I will have no more babbling, no more friendships !"&#xD;
"Won't you let us go to the bee I" asked the girl, who&#xD;
dared all in a strange spirit of persistence, rather than lose&#xD;
the coveted pleasure.&#xD;
"And would you, a convicted felon's daughter, accept&#xD;
and justify his death by bandying equrtesies with his&#xD;
murderers? Let me hear no more of it!"&#xD;
"Our father died in prison, but not a guilty man,"&#xD;
said Orchis, her eyes deepening and glimmering from their&#xD;
dark depths.&#xD;
Since, then,.you are not able to revenge his torinents,&#xD;
at least keep clear of the humanity which accomplished&#xD;
the infamy!"&#xD;
That niglit Candace cried herself to sleep in Orchis'&#xD;
arms, while the elder child lay awake through the long&#xD;
hours thinking; and this was the result of her vigil:&#xD;
"A  friend is a good to be coveted. Candace is a&#xD;
lucky girl to have found such a treasure. In spite of&#xD;
the great calamity which enshrouded them, there must be&#xD;
a place in the large world for them, innocent sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sufferings ought to end, unless they punish guilt. Even&#xD;
then, why should be there more than one hell, and what&#xD;
is the use of forestalling the fire and brimstone here in&#xD;
this life?  With only seventeen years behind her, she&#xD;
could not drag such a lengthening chair; she must find an&#xD;
outlet from the dumb stillness of the days. She was&#xD;
willing to try it in face of Clytie's 'prohibition, at the&#xD;
risk of trouble; and if Blush Beach was persevering&#xD;
enough in his friendship to come again, she would take&#xD;
Candace to the bee. There she could at least look on&#xD;
and learn what her kind was like, and be glad in her lit-&#xD;
tle sister's happiness." At this point she kissed the rosy&#xD;
cheek pillowed upon her breast, and waited for the&#xD;
dawn, and the sleep angel hovering near, softly closed&#xD;
her eyes and gave her pleasant dream.&#xD;

her pet, mindful of tears and patches. Gynet hugged&#xD;
and fondled him, and thanked the Lord that he was safe&#xD;
from the men of Belial (meaning Clytie and'her dog).&#xD;
And the blooming Effie took him aside to ask all about&#xD;
the girls, and talk over the bee, and to inquire especially&#xD;
how Orchis looked without he'r shaker bonnett and it&#xD;
was with this coadjutor that he discussed his chance of&#xD;
probable success, and got strength and upholding in his&#xD;
obstinate resolution to "stick and hang like a dog to a&#xD;
root," as he expressed it, and the result of all this talking&#xD;
and the sly fun Effie poked at him. for getting locked out&#xD;
after all his boasting, was a furious determination to carry&#xD;
his point, and have Candace by his side at the apple&#xD;
basket; and try " paring fortune with her before the ev-&#xD;
ening should reach its nadir," and he practised by himself&#xD;
&#xD;
113&#xD;
&#xD;
throwing over his shoulder the long. delicate crimson curls&#xD;
he skilfully cut from the ruddy fruit, so as to make them&#xD;
fall D's, till he felt pretty'sure of being able to carve&#xD;
his fate out of an apple-paring, as well as to cut " sweet-&#xD;
heart" on a staff, and cover himself with glory among&#xD;
the five women who were quite inclined to nurse the&#xD;
germs of love in the boy, which they had never then-&#xD;
selves experienced.&#xD;
Blush was fearful that Candace might avoid him in&#xD;
the lane at trysting-time, driving home her lowing&#xD;
kine at evening, as he failed to find her after the fray;&#xD;
so he rose early and hastened down to meet her the next&#xD;
morning, and get a promise from her; and sure enough,&#xD;
there she was under the great maples, walking sorrow-&#xD;
fully, with downcast head, so busy thinking that she did&#xD;
not hear his footfall on the soft turf.&#xD;
"Good morning, sweethearti1" he called out cheerily.&#xD;
The hurried glance she cast about her, showed that a fr h&#xD;
interdict had been laid upon her.&#xD;
" I am glad I found you; you see I got up early on&#xD;
purpose. Where were you last nighti"-&#xD;
" In the house. I sent Ajax for the cows."&#xD;
"Yes, so as not to see me. I know all about it, but it&#xD;
is of no fase; I won't be turned outso easy. I mean to&#xD;
stick closer than a brother; I don't care a fig for what&#xD;
happened.yesterday. I can bring Olytie to my mind&#xD;
sooner or later, if you will be smart and not afraid.&#xD;
How is Toss? she got well flaxed out, didn't she, poor&#xD;
dog?"&#xD;
"She is doing well ; Ynshti took care of her. Vashti&#xD;
can cure anything ; but Clytie will never speak to her&#xD;
a am. I expect she will shoot her. I. am afraid she will&#xD;
s ioot you."&#xD;

"Pooh! I am not. Don't let's talk about it. I came&#xD;
here to get you to promise to come to the bee. I'm going&#xD;
to call for you. I'll storm the place. I'llknock the gate&#xD;
down, if I can't get in without. Miss Clytie can't fool&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Orchis says we will come," replied Candace; "she&#xD;
says it is right. She is sixteen and a half, and she'says&#xD;
we will be women before long, and we must try to find&#xD;
out how other women act, so as to be ready to act like&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"I hope not like some of them; but Orchis is as&#xD;
straight as a plumb. She's a peach'! the real grit. I&#xD;
like Orchis, and Eflie will be glad of her and be kind to&#xD;
her. And there's Precious Plunket; he will sit at our&#xD;
basket. flow jolly nice ! Hillo Ajax, good fellow ! did&#xD;
you beat her. I am afraid you will come to grief though,.&#xD;
if Clytie is as mad as they say she is."&#xD;
"She is not mad, Blush ; she never seems to feel any-&#xD;
how like the rest of us-; but I can't help trembling to&#xD;
think what she may do to you. She walks right along,&#xD;
and kills things that come in her road ; and never looks at&#xD;
them afterwards. I wish you would be careful."&#xD;
"Nonsense ! I guess sbe, knows too well what would&#xD;
happen to her  she meddled with me. The law would&#xD;
fix her."&#xD;
"Clytie does not care for law; she despises it."&#xD;
"That wouldn't hinder her from paying its penalty.&#xD;
She must know that inside. Don't you fret. She don't&#xD;
want to end her days on a gallows; not she. I'm not&#xD;
a mite afraid."&#xD;
"Blush ! if you knew smething dreadful which had&#xD;
happened to us a great whil ago, could you still like Orchis&#xD;
and me, if we were not to blame?$",&#xD;
&#xD;
"Of course I could, and would. What do you suppose&#xD;
I care about what happened, so long as you are pretty&#xD;
and I like you."&#xD;
"So long as 'we are pretty !' Is that the way yon&#xD;
feel? Then if I should get scars on my face, or go lame,&#xD;
or anything like that, you wouldn't run after me any&#xD;
more. I don't care for that sort of friendship. I should&#xD;
like you just as much if you was all smashed to bits, and&#xD;
as ugly as pizen."&#xD;
"What's the use of disputing about such things that&#xD;
are never going to happen. That's what my father used&#xD;
to call 'getting up bug-bears and fighting them."'&#xD;
"Well, you can't be my sweetheart after all, I think. I&#xD;
will wait for the swarm you, promised," said Candace,&#xD;
bursting into a laugh at his vexed face, feeling that she&#xD;
had crowded him into a bad box from which he could&#xD;
not gracefully get out.&#xD;
"I just told you, Candace," said he soberly, "that I,&#xD;
should always be your friend, boy and man, if you want&#xD;
me; and you'd better think twice before you refuse a&#xD;
friend. I shall be older by and by, but I shan't change&#xD;
much, except to get bigger and know more."&#xD;
"And you will stand by Orchis and me, no matter what&#xD;
folks say ?."&#xD;
"Folks ! who are folks ? I haven't got any myself. I&#xD;
shall be your sweetheart. I remember my father's teach-&#xD;
ing to mind my own business; but when I've done the&#xD;
carving on the staff, then your business will be mine, and&#xD;
then let them- blaze away; who cares?" &#xD;
"Nobody, so you don't change your mind, when you&#xD;
get out of roundabouts and get into coats like the minis-&#xD;
ter you showed me the other day in his black elothes.&#xD;
Don't laugh, Blush; I feel so serious."&#xD;

As she gave her nose a little push he laughed the&#xD;
more, but as tears sprang to her eyes he stopped quickly.&#xD;
"Everything is so queer, Blush. I feel it now, when I&#xD;
begin to have the chance Orchis and I have been talking&#xD;
over- so long. I'm  half afraid to venture. I wish -I&#xD;
could confide in';you, but. I must not. You will have to&#xD;
take us as we are, ahd make the best of us."&#xD;
" I will, sweetheart. When I saw your sister strike you&#xD;
that day, I had to clinch my fists to hold still, but I did&#xD;
it. I gave you the chance afterwards to speak out, but&#xD;
you shut up your secret. Of course, I know you've got&#xD;
a family history.; I don't want to pry into it. We have&#xD;
had ,some good times already, and we're going to have&#xD;
lots more, as sure as my name is Blush Beach.',&#xD;
"I hope so. I don't know mnch, but Ifeel all through&#xD;
how honest and good you are. I'll tell Orchis. But&#xD;
I've got a little trouble. I should like to fix up, and go to&#xD;
your party out of tie front door. I feel mean to be&#xD;
deceiving Olytie, though I really am certain, and Orchis&#xD;
is certain, that she has no right to keep us in."&#xD;
"You look better as you are, sweetheart, than. the rest&#xD;
do in their foldirols. Don't feel mean. Feel as if you were,&#xD;
a princess escaping fromher to er, or a fairy coming out&#xD;
of a prison: and be sure and be"ready early, because if&#xD;
you do have to climb the fence, we don't want to be in a&#xD;
hurry about it. I know where's a first-rate ladder, and&#xD;
I'll have it on hand."&#xD;
"Orchis thinks she can get the key from Goody.&#xD;
Ruddock."&#xD;
"Don't believe it, Candace. That old creature is as&#xD;
faithful to your sister as Toss herself, and I'd rather help&#xD;
you over the wall anyhow. I like the idea: an adventure,&#xD;
you know, like the three Spaniards, Peter Simple, or,&#xD;
&#xD;
the Children of the :Abbey that Precious Plunket lent&#xD;
me."&#xD;
".But I don't want any adventures," replied Candace.&#xD;
"I want to be a good girl and have good times. What a&#xD;
day that was at Sister Polly's, wasn't it? when I got my&#xD;
two offers: 'Say, Miss, just stick your head in a barrel and&#xD;
say Miss Pember, and see if it don't sound nice,'"she con-&#xD;
tinued, whispering to the lad behind her hand.&#xD;
Blush looked at her as she gave the little brush up-&#xD;
wards to her nose, and listened to the merry laugh which&#xD;
accompanied his quotation, and admired her rosiness and&#xD;
arch eyes.&#xD;
"I tell you what, Candace: there never was a girl so&#xD;
cut out for good times,-a pleasant, cheerful, nice life,..-as&#xD;
you are ; and you are as good and true, and as cunning as&#xD;
you can be too ;--and to think that I arn the only boy&#xD;
you know! Now when you come to see'?ecious Plunket&#xD;
and Tip Crowfoot and Pom Blossom, and the rest, you&#xD;
mustn't like them. better than you do me. I believe,&#xD;
after all,  had better leave you home. It won't ever&#xD;
seem just  e same as now, after you have cocked your&#xD;
eye at other fellows and talked so free. I want a sweet-&#xD;
heart all to myself."&#xD;
"Don't say that, Blush; I don't like it ; it does not&#xD;
sound pretty. If I talk free, it is because I don't know&#xD;
any better; and I shall learn as fast as I can,;-and how&#xD;
queer !" she added after a moment's reflection. "Of&#xD;
course you chat and sport with all the girls you -know,&#xD;
and tell them things, and toss up your cap, and carry on.&#xD;
No; on the whole, I think I'd rather not go to the bee.&#xD;
You wouldn't ever seem just the same to me after I had&#xD;
seen you do it."&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
&#xD;
CANDACE GETS INTO MISCHIEF.&#xD;
T was not difficult for the two girls to elude Olytie,&#xD;
whb never watched them, and was always in her&#xD;
room by seven o'clock, or out at her grave under&#xD;
the wailing pines, unless kept abroad by her hunting;&#xD;
and this evening she did not come at all to. the supper-&#xD;
table, but locked herself into her apartment, fetching&#xD;
away the faded flowers from her retreat, which she had&#xD;
replaced with fresh ones. Strange enough they were too,&#xD;
an eyrie group upon the sleeper's breast: half a dozen&#xD;
stately arums, their stems speckled as a frog's back, their&#xD;
fancifully cut leaves flecked with snow, and their fiery,&#xD;
calla-shaped blossoms shooting straight upward in flam-&#xD;
ing splendor. There was no lack -of variety in her deco-,&#xD;
rations of her altar.  All the beauties and sweets her&#xD;
garden yielded were' culled at their best, and arranged&#xD;
with a careful richness a delicate fancying, which might&#xD;
have been a study.&#xD;
Orchis methodically made herself tidy in her clean&#xD;
home-made dress of blue check, smoothed her hair, which,&#xD;
like her elder sister, she wore close cropped in her neck.&#xD;
She fastened into it a couple of buds, which nature&#xD;
taught her to place in the most becoming way; and such&#xD;
a trim, prim girl was hardly ever seen. Her scanty gowa&#xD;

&#xD;
following the outline of her slender shape, which was able&#xD;
to bear the simplicity ; and not a frill or bow or orna-&#xD;
ment except her rose-buds to take the attention from her&#xD;
severely beautiful face.&#xD;
Naturally she desired to see herself as others saw her ;&#xD;
and as there was not, nor ever had been, a mirror in the&#xD;
house, and it was too dark to look, like Narcissus, into&#xD;
the water-pool, she lifted her window, pinned a black&#xD;
cloth to the sash outside, and holding a. candle closely,&#xD;
she had a substitute, of which she made the most, literally&#xD;
seeing herself in a glass, darkly.&#xD;
Having thus completed her meagre toilet, she found&#xD;
time to wonder what had become of Candace, who had,&#xD;
skipped: off, after her scrub and polish and a kiss of her&#xD;
bright, fresh, firm lips, like the cool velvet of a red rose,&#xD;
with a towel pinned around her plump shoulders, saying:&#xD;
"I'll be back in a minute."&#xD;
So many busy thoughts were working in her mind, so&#xD;
many conjectures, fears; and hopes, that Orchis paid not&#xD;
her nsual loving heed to the caresses of her pet; but she&#xD;
was. so long away, that she was getting uneasy enough to&#xD;
think of hunting her, when lo! she sprang into the room&#xD;
with a laugh and a bound, and landed at her sister's feet;&#xD;
but so metamorphosed that Orchis could hardly believe in&#xD;
her identity, and felt half afraid, as of a fairy changeling,&#xD;
till a fond hug and a showeriof kisses proved her the real,&#xD;
human, loving child.&#xD;
A soft, singing robe of azure crape, a lace 'kerchief&#xD;
crossed in front and knotted at the back of her waist, her&#xD;
eisp curls snooded with pale blue-ribbons, and a knot of&#xD;
the same upon her breast holding some crimson buds. She&#xD;
looked lovely, arch, saucy, and as charming as fifteen&#xD;
eodld be.&#xD;
&#xD;

uHow do you find me in finery?" whispered she&#xD;
"Will I do for the princess escaping from her tower,-or&#xD;
the Kelpie Queen i'&#xD;
But what does it mean, Candace$ " replied Orchis,&#xD;
also under her breath. "Has Blush dared-?"&#xD;
Her only solution of the mystery was that the rash and&#xD;
importunate youth had surreptitously conveyed to the&#xD;
little witch such garments as he deemed needful. for&#xD;
her appearance in his company: and a displeased&#xD;
frown gathered between her intense eyes at the bare&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
No; Blush hasn't dared, nor dreamed of daring.&#xD;
found my wants in our old garret."&#xD;
You took them from Olytie's trunk ! "replied Orehis,&#xD;
pale and still; the black trunk, which has never been&#xD;
opened."&#xD;
Yes, that awful old thing, over which we used to tell&#xD;
so many stories, and use up so many guesses; but don't&#xD;
make such eyes at me, Orchis.; you spoil all my pleasure.&#xD;
I won't hurt the stupid things ; do them good to air them;&#xD;
-and as for Clytie Dunwreath, I don't care a whit ! she&#xD;
ought to see to us and help us; it is her duty as our&#xD;
elder sister. Blush says so, or what means that,; and I&#xD;
know he is right."&#xD;
This was such a long stride toward the independence&#xD;
she had only seen in the dim future, that it tool Orchis'&#xD;
breath away; and though she loved her pet well enough&#xD;
to make great personal sacrifices for her, she felt it quite&#xD;
impossible to countenance such bold conduct.&#xD;
"You must not wear the things, Candace ! Come,&#xD;
hasten and put them back ; and I will help you to get on&#xD;
your clean gown ; there's a dear ; .do ! E have had&#xD;
trouble enough to feel right about stealing off, as we shall&#xD;

step unless you do."&#xD;
".Oh yes, you can, Orchis; I look so nice ; don't I?&#xD;
Here, let me see me in your pretty eyes; " bringing her&#xD;
face close to her sister's and smiling mischievously; "I&#xD;
told you so, I am lovely ! and look at the pins I've taken&#xD;
the trouble toput in the skirt to get it short enough; I&#xD;
shall dance to-night,,maybe ; folks do dance in the world,&#xD;
and I must do as others do. I hope I shall not sit upon&#xD;
any of the points and get stuck ; I should have to scream&#xD;
if I did, aA then there would be a state of things ! I&#xD;
found the dress and ribbons and slippers, and all done up&#xD;
together. Clytie has a little foot; and this knot was&#xD;
also in the paper" (putting her fingers .to one at her&#xD;
throat)-; "and it had some old withered flowers sticking&#xD;
in it, which, you see, I have replaced to my liking, and 1&#xD;
know they all belong together. There was a label or&#xD;
something on a card; I didn't stop to make it out. ; Oh!&#xD;
'there's Blush! that is his cherry-bird's whistle ; come&#xD;
quickly, Orchis ; do, dear sister!"&#xD;
Orchis resisted her hands; which strove to pull her&#xD;
forward; her face was white and her eyes glistened as&#xD;
she looked at her pleading pet.&#xD;
"Don't be selfish, Orchis: I'll bear all the blame. Oh !&#xD;
what shall I do to coax heri There won't be any blame.&#xD;
I am not doing wrong. 0 Orchis,, don't you love me ? "&#xD;
"Selfish ! Candace-me selfish to you?$ Oh no, dar-&#xD;
ling, I do love you, and I will prove how much. Come&#xD;
along !"&#xD;
" Kiss me first; look sweet at me."&#xD;
"There's a kiss then, dear; I'll get my face right pres-&#xD;
ently. I feel conscious that you are doing wrong, but I&#xD;
am going to let you without more ado. Selfish! oh no;,&#xD;
&#xD;

never selfish. There! that's the end ; now it is in the&#xD;
past; and the past is dead."&#xD;
"I-don't understand you, Orchis dear!"&#xD;
"Very likely, for I don't half understand myself. Are&#xD;
we all ready?2 Shut the door softly ; hush !"&#xD;
Right away, after parting with Blush in the meadow,&#xD;
Candace had mounted to the garret loft. It was' half&#xD;
filled with furniture-cases. which had never been. un-&#xD;
packed, chests which had never been moved, since they&#xD;
were hoisted there five years before. She remembered&#xD;
watching the men remove the great doubt window&#xD;
under the.ridg pole, and haul them up with ropes; and&#xD;
she half recol ected a resonant wail as one of them&#xD;
dashed against the w 1 in its upward journey, and how&#xD;
she and Orchis h   said, "Now the piano is crying to&#xD;
have to be shut p there."  There were also many boxes&#xD;
and trunks piled on each other, and from, some of them&#xD;
she meant to fetch what she sought. She peeped and&#xD;
tried one after another; they were nailed fast, and cov-&#xD;
ered with dust and cobwebs.   She and Orchis had&#xD;
played rag-baby and house-keeping behind them many a&#xD;
time, replenishing their family, as often as they felt a&#xD;
lack, from among the cobs of the corn-house close by.&#xD;
She was about to give up her search in despair, when she&#xD;
saw, tucked under the eaves, a bunch of keys, twenty or&#xD;
more, buried in dust and dry-rot, crusted with rust. She&#xD;
hurriedly fitted them one by one to the large trunk, back&#xD;
by itself, and she found' the right one. It turned,&#xD;
snapped the lock, and she lifted the lid.&#xD;
It was full of dresses, shawls, and other women's&#xD;
gear. So full that she could not help lifting the hand-&#xD;
some things, the like of which she had never imagined&#xD;
and admiring them. One 'package fascinated her, and&#xD;

&#xD;
she made choice of it directly: a blue crape, wrapped in&#xD;
a paper apart from the rest, also enclosing a card upon&#xD;
which were a few written words.&#xD;
Hearing Goody Ruddock's voice below, she dropped&#xD;
the package behind the boxes, and letting down the lid,&#xD;
stole away in a. tremor of hurry and fright at what she&#xD;
had done.&#xD;
A dozen times that day she looked for Orchis to tell&#xD;
her about it, but she had gone down the long wood&#xD;
nutting, and did not return till almost evening ; and then&#xD;
so silent and quiet that Candace could not open her lips;&#xD;
but resolved to take her by storm; that'course being&#xD;
sometimes, she had learned, the safest, when she desired&#xD;
to carry a point with her firm, unselfish sister.&#xD;

THE BUSY BEE.&#xD;
HE escapade was successfully accomplished byH&#xD;
the help of a fruit-ladder ; and, when the two&#xD;
girls were safely landed on the wrong side of4&#xD;
their high fence, they saw in the dim light a young man&#xD;
awaiting them.&#xD;
Candace proceeded immediately to, the ceremony of&#xD;
introduction: "This is my dear sister Orchis, Blush."&#xD;
"Most happy to make Miss Orchis' acquaintance,' red&#xD;
plied the youngster politely, and he felt the hand he took&#xD;
to tremble in his clasp as she answered him simply:&#xD;
"I hope your friendship will be worth the trouble and&#xD;
thinking it has cost me."&#xD;
"I'll do my level best to make it so, believe me '" said&#xD;
he warmly, with a hearty squeeze of her fingers; "and I&#xD;
think I shall succeed. it is a queer way to begin an ac-&#xD;
quaintance by jumping into it over a high fence, isn't it?&#xD;
But any way will do, so it goes on and we get comfort&#xD;
out of it. Your sister whipped me into Candace's heart&#xD;
with such licks, that I have stuck fast there ever since,;&#xD;
and now you drop down like a dove out -of ihe  clouds,&#xD;

couple of pretty sisters, and you see if I don't make a&#xD;
tiptop brother."'&#xD;
"Yes; thank you !" thought Orchis, setting him apart&#xD;
in her mind as the sole property of her pet. "I am glad&#xD;
she has got one who suits her so well. He is nice."&#xD;
Pushing through the bushes and stubble, they came out&#xD;
after a while on the highway by scrambling over an old&#xD;
wall, whose briers fought, resisted, and punished their&#xD;
temerity, as is the nature of briers. Happy ye who are&#xD;
not set to struggle and bleed among human thorns, who&#xD;
tear your hearts and prick all your dearest sensibilities&#xD;
into suffering. Those unsouled tormentors could only&#xD;
leave some scratches and a few blood-drops as memories&#xD;
of their spite; and then Orchis walked silently by Can-&#xD;
dace's side, who chatted and sparred and laughed, glee-&#xD;
ful as a wild bird escaped from a cage ; and her heart&#xD;
almost stopped beating when they neared the old stone&#xD;
house all alight, and a great dread of the new life she was&#xD;
daring, fell oppressingly upon her.&#xD;
"Wait just a minute," said she, laying her fingers on&#xD;
her sister's arm. "I don't want to go in fluttered; let&#xD;
me think a little. Yes; they are made like us; we have&#xD;
one common father; we are innocent children of good&#xD;
people; it is our world as much as theirs ; we have a right&#xD;
to all its beauties, and to share all its goods; we only&#xD;
seek for our lawful part. I will not be frightened or&#xD;
turned back. I must go on."&#xD;
The two, who had been watching her, listening to her&#xD;
brief murmured words, felt that she was battling with her-&#xD;
self, and took each one of her hands, as she made a step&#xD;
forward. . The electric love-touch and the hearty boy-&#xD;
hand helped her; and she wore her usual serene face&#xD;
when'the door opened to admit them.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Effie, who received the trio, replied to Blush's pre-&#xD;
sentation with a kind greeting:&#xD;
"Glad to see you. You come hand in hand like the&#xD;
babes in the woods. I must kiss you, to taste if your lips&#xD;
are not flavored with the blackberries you ought to have&#xD;
plucked on your way."&#xD;
"Out of season, Aunt Effie; but the bushes are 'all&#xD;
there, rampant as ever."&#xD;
"Yes, as full of total depravity as they can stick."&#xD;
"We got enough of their sticking ; truly, tiger-cats&#xD;
couldn't be more rapacious," said Candace easily.&#xD;
Whilethe blooming Effie was helping, and looking,&#xD;
and making talk, and Candace was arranging her ribbons&#xD;
with new delight before the small, old-time mirror with&#xD;
its gilt balls and landscape atop, the four sisters came in&#xD;
a body to welcome their guests.&#xD;
"fHow nice of you to come !1" said Arabella, giving&#xD;
both her hands. "We've been neighbors long enough to&#xD;
be acquaintances,-and we. ought to be friends. I hope&#xD;
you will come often."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed," chimed in Margery, waving her fin-&#xD;
gers, and offering them; white and dimpled, to Orchis;&#xD;
"as you have found the way, you must not forget it.&#xD;
You must also come to church and take a seat in our&#xD;
pew."&#xD;
"And belong to our Dorcas," said Elevir; "we are.&#xD;
filling a box for the gourds, and we want to enlist all the&#xD;
young, spry fingers we can. 'I've got a bran new pattern&#xD;
for a roll needle-book, which is a perfect beauty; I'll show&#xD;
it to you."&#xD;
"Blush is a good lad, and I think the best thing he&#xD;
has ever done is to coax you to 3alquither," said Gynet..&#xD;
" Let us go, lassie ; go to the braes of Balquither,"&#xD;

hummed Effe. "Now we must hasten downstairs and&#xD;
get to work at our baskets. Preciotis Plunket is there&#xD;
waiting"&#xD;
"Not till they promise to come again," insisted Mar-&#xD;
gery. "I will have these girls in our circle."&#xD;
Youare very good," answered Orchis, modestly. "I&#xD;
also wish it; I came here this evening to find a place&#xD;
among you.'"&#xD;
Looking in her firm, quiet face, they all felt that she&#xD;
was earnest. and true, and conceived a respect for her ;&#xD;
but they kissed. Candace, and Effie put an arm around&#xD;
her waist as they descended ; while Orchis followed&#xD;
alone ; no one placed a hand on hers.&#xD;
The other four remained en haut awhile, discussing&#xD;
the new-comers and exchanging opinions; but as they all&#xD;
talked at once, and nobody listened, I am afraid they&#xD;
were not much profited by the converse.&#xD;
When Blush caught sight of the young girl in blue&#xD;
crape and lace kerchief, with bright eyes and cheeks, and&#xD;
another in homespun check, as handsome as Diana; he&#xD;
couldn't think of anything to say. But Candace, whose&#xD;
-heart beat high, and who looked merry and arch and&#xD;
piquant and charming, began the talk herself, chatting&#xD;
gayly, perfectly at her ease; as if with her society clothes&#xD;
she had also put on her company manners. It was like a&#xD;
dream to the youngster, and he wouldn't for his life have&#xD;
dared to call this fine lady, "sweetheart."&#xD;
Pretty soon Precious Plunket came up as if he had.&#xD;
been waiting, and got presented; and Candace fixed her&#xD;
eyes on him, and then glanced at Blush, remembering&#xD;
their talk;. and as she laughed archly, he remembered it&#xD;
too, for he shook his head, at her slyly, and put his fists&#xD;
infghting trim behind- his friend's~ back.&#xD;

.THE BUSY BEE. N      129&#xD;
&#xD;
There was a great buzz and hum of busy voices, not all&#xD;
over sweet, in the wide kitchen; and the many clusters&#xD;
about the baskets stopped their tongues and their work,&#xD;
so that it was in a dead silence that the strangers sat&#xD;
down in Blush's circle.&#xD;
Candace blushed, and swept the faces with an angry&#xD;
glance as; she saw elbows jogging their neighbors, and&#xD;
caught whispers : "The old maids."  "As true as you&#xD;
live."  "Well, I wonder what will happen next ? as the&#xD;
polywog said when his tail dropped off !" and so on, till,&#xD;
her eyes lighting on Orchis, quiet, calm, she "pushed up&#xD;
her nose, perched her saucy head a bit more on one side,&#xD;
and tried not to mind it.&#xD;
Orchis examined those about her from a still distance&#xD;
her reserve made for her. No one marking her outward&#xD;
repose would have dreamed of the agitation and whirl&#xD;
within. Fo the first time. surrounded by strangers so&#xD;
strange, the centre of covert and open curiosity, the theme&#xD;
of whispers and comments which constantly reached her.&#xD;
Standing fast by the purpose which hadbrought her,&#xD;
she .kept her self-poise, and -conned the lesson her peers&#xD;
offered her.&#xD;
Mr. Plunket being har opposite at the basket, she came&#xD;
around to him in course of her study, and looked him&#xD;
over with unconscious coolness, which would have been&#xD;
rude in anybody else.&#xD;
le seemed to her quite a remarkable creature. She&#xD;
gazed at him as island-reared Miranda did at ship-wrecked&#xD;
Ferdinand; and he bore well her scrutiny.&#xD;
Precious Plunket was one of those "babes of grace&#xD;
who climb apace," and like the redired rose which sprang&#xD;
from the breast of the fair Nancee, and' grew and grew&#xD;
till it couldn't grow higher, he had 'stretched up above&#xD;

father and mother and all the rest of his relations, till he&#xD;
stood six feet two in his. stockings, with only nineteen&#xD;
years of his life laid away behind him.&#xD;
"LPrecious," his mother had. called him at the font, and&#xD;
he grew more and more :precious as the years rolled on&#xD;
and no other children jostled him in her affections.&#xD;
He had a frank face, not especially handsome, but&#xD;
strong and brave; very straight brown hair, which he&#xD;
kept constantly touzled and on end by running his fin-&#xD;
gers through it ; a splendid physique; broad shoulders,&#xD;
fit for burdens; full chest, able to give voice to his will;&#xD;
straight, well-made limbs, sufficient, to carry his head&#xD;
whither his brain sent him; an enduring swimmer, a&#xD;
bold leaper, a swift runner, a tireless walker. Andone&#xD;
thing I always noted about this fellow: though he ex-&#xD;
celled all his companions in such feats of strength and&#xD;
trials of skill as boys delight to pride themselves upon,&#xD;
they with one accord yielded him precedence and loved&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Mr. Plunket was a farmer, who liked patents and im-&#xD;
provenents, and raised stock ; whose highest ambition&#xD;
was to see his son and, heir tread in his footsteps.&#xD;
"Why," said he, "if. Presh would only take to farming,&#xD;
I'd bay up all the land that's lying loose around here, for&#xD;
him."  But unfortunately jhe young person did not like&#xD;
his father's calling, named it '"drudgery ;" and his mother,&#xD;
a slender, book-loving woman, aided and abetted her boy&#xD;
in his desires for an education. So there was a division&#xD;
Sinthe household, and though Precious rode, the reaper,&#xD;
and prided himself on being the best rider in the county,&#xD;
broke the colts, milked the cows and the like, and did all&#xD;
faithfully, he looked beyond, and steadily kept his pur-&#xD;
pose to go to college; and he had a fair chance of at&#xD;
&#xD;
Li&#xD;
&#xD;
training his end, with his mother to back him, because a&#xD;
wise, purposeful woman, is pretty sure to get her will in "&#xD;
the matrimonial alliance. Precious said, there were more&#xD;
ways to .kill a cat than to ;choke him with butter. He&#xD;
didn't mean any disrespect to his father either. It was&#xD;
only a boy's way of: expressing his estimate of the ma-&#xD;
ternal power.&#xD;
He studied hard all winter, and such odd times as he&#xD;
could make ; and there is after all no foundation for ed-&#xD;
ucation like that laid by a careful, painstaking, intellhgent/&#xD;
mother, who has been an industrious gleaner. She can&#xD;
suggest so many little items which are necessary, and are&#xD;
generally overlooked by teachers. She can read up with&#xD;
her children so many dry books, which must be read, and&#xD;
cover with her talks such a large field, little by. little,&#xD;
grain by grain, till the scholar finds himself at home a-&#xD;
most everywhere. All countries belong to him. Nature&#xD;
is unveiled. Art's wonders are familiar, even though&#xD;
only the wood-cuts have yet come under his eyes. He&#xD;
knows who wrote, who composed, who painted, who gov-&#xD;
erned, who.suffered, who conquered through the ages,---or&#xD;
at least so much of all this, that he can never pause till he&#xD;
knows more ; and with such a start will go on and on, as&#xD;
long as his useful brain will work.&#xD;
Mrs. Plunket and her lad had much book lore already&#xD;
laid away, which they two enjoyed in common, which was&#xD;
a dead letter to the bustling, money-getting, busy father,&#xD;
who would rather have made his son a "great operator,'&#xD;
than the nicest scholar in the world.&#xD;
Although rearedin the country, Precious had no bump&#xD;
kin awkwardness Being the constant companion of a lady&#xD;
all through his boyhood and youth, the rough men and&#xD;
rough ways about him would not cling to ha. He nec-&#xD;

essarily caught graces of manner from her, which mingled&#xD;
oddly enough, I must own, sometimes with the boy-slang,&#xD;
without which a boy would be an unnatural andunpleas-&#xD;
ant animal. But the lady did not quite seeit so, and she&#xD;
did her prettiest to wipe all such phrases from his speech,&#xD;
and was accustomed to string his whole assortment to-&#xD;
gether and present it to his notice, like this: "Jingo&#xD;
peltus !-Gaully !-Snab I-Bully  boy !-Jericho.  Pre-&#xD;
cious,,*have you got your lesson?"  But though he felt&#xD;
the reproof, and laughed at the incongruous epithets in.&#xD;
her mouth, he would say:&#xD;
"I acknowledge the corn, mother. I'll brace up and&#xD;
waggle the slang, sure as winking: Thunder and plun-&#xD;
der! snooks and snuggers ! I will, so help me John&#xD;
Rogers !"&#xD;
Getting thus far, the lady stopped her ears and departed&#xD;
to her vocations:&#xD;
;Though Orchis was a stranger and very beautiful, he&#xD;
was not afraid of her, and dashed at once into talk, look-&#xD;
ing her in the face, as true boys brought up by true.&#xD;
women are quite apt to do, and if he was not ready to&#xD;
play Ferdinand to her Miranda, he certainly liked her.&#xD;
looks and ways amazingly.&#xD;
When he told his mother about it afterwards he said:&#xD;
"She looked,like a picture, sitting so still and lovely, and&#xD;
her dress was so-well, kind of plain, no puckers in it, you&#xD;
know, no fuss; and she had a rose right up here" (stick-&#xD;
ing his fingers among his tangles, which action caused the&#xD;
dame unconsciously to imagine how a rose would look&#xD;
hiding in her darling's stubborn crop, and how she, the&#xD;
little woman, would have to stand on tip-toe to smell its&#xD;
fragrance, such a tower of manhood was he getting to&#xD;
be); "it seemed to belong there, as if she was a flower&#xD;
&#xD;
herself; and Jingo peltus! mother, I wish yon could have&#xD;
seen her handsome eyes so cool and deep and black,-no,&#xD;
blue, I am sure, and true they were,-blue and thought=&#xD;
ful. I like girls that will show you their eyes; especially&#xD;
when they are like hers, but I never saw such before."&#xD;
"I like out-spoken, out-looking people too, my boy,&#xD;
people who have such clean lives, that they have, nothing&#xD;
to hide; who do not stop to calculate the effect of every&#xD;
word before it is uttered; who are not afraid to show&#xD;
their eyes, lest a secret thought should leap out and give&#xD;
their speech the lie."&#xD;
Meanwhile the business of the evening was rapidly&#xD;
progressing, what with patent parers and patent corers,&#xD;
the bee wasn't half what bees used to be in the old times ;&#xD;
and by nine o'clock the baskets were all emptied, and the&#xD;
quarters strung on long strings which they nailed in fes-&#xD;
toons upon frames, that they might be set in the sun to&#xD;
dry; and then the young men bustled about, removing&#xD;
the debris, and the girls swept the floor, and made the&#xD;
place tidy for their frolic, which was to commence immedi-&#xD;
ately after supper.&#xD;
Now," said Blush, "I'll begin to bring up the fellows&#xD;
and introduce them, as .soon as this mess is got --along&#xD;
'with."&#xD;
Augusta Blossom, who had sat at the next basket, was al-&#xD;
ready on speaking terms with the strangers, and she went&#xD;
after her brother Pom and presented him, but the shy&#xD;
youngster only stayed long enough to make a sidewise&#xD;
bow, and get very red in the face, before he edged back&#xD;
among his friends; and there Augusta told them with&#xD;
girlish volubility who the others were.&#xD;

Crowfoot, she made fun of Porn once; and do you know'&#xD;
what I did 1 I scratched her face ! laiways take Pom's&#xD;
part. When we were little, we went to a Christmas-tree,&#xD;
and Pornwas as broad as he was long, and the minister&#xD;
laughed at -him, and I didn't speak to another body that&#xD;
whole evening, and I gave him all I got from the fish-&#xD;
pond and the grab-bag; that's my fashion. So I give you&#xD;
fair warning. I paid it off, too, on her brother Maxwell.&#xD;
Maxy, flaxy, waxy, I call him: that tow head over there,&#xD;
that is looking at Miss Orchis with his mouth open.&#xD;
I wonder he hasn't made a set at her before this time.&#xD;
Precious Plunket says he has got brass enough to make&#xD;
a kettle, sass enough to fill it, and gas enough to blow it&#xD;
up. The bald-headed man, in the corner, is Doctor Car-&#xD;
son. He is dreadfully learned in skeletons; he makes&#xD;
them. He has got five or six in his office in a glass case.&#xD;
They say he once put together a mastodon, or some other&#xD;
long name, twenty-five high. You give him a bone an&#xD;
inch long, and he will find you the whole animal which&#xD;
belongs to it."&#xD;
"I say Gussey," put in Blush, "~why don't you give him&#xD;
4 joint out of your little finger, and let him find the man&#xD;
Ahat belongs to you?"&#xD;
"hI shouldn't dare, Blush. What if he should tell me" it&#xD;
was you. I don't want to be miserable before my time."&#xD;
Gussey finished her speech by thrusting out her little&#xD;
pointed tongue, and withdrawing it, in about the space of&#xD;
a flash of. lightning, an action so saucy and so naughty,&#xD;
that Candace felt drawn toward her at once.&#xD;
"I like you," said she; "you are so merry!." .&#xD;
"Merry ! yes "-put in Blush, "but remember the old&#xD;
song:&#xD;

"'It's good to be merry and wise,,&#xD;
Keep your tongue still in your mouth&#xD;
And look very sweet out of your eyes.'&#xD;
"Ah, here comes that limb of a Bugby."&#xD;
"Oh! a limb of the law--Precious Plunket says he com-&#xD;
eth up like a flower."&#xD;
"I don't mean the grown-u Bugby; I mean the little&#xD;
wretch who is throwing Effle's kittens downstairs. Here,&#xD;
you young mischief, you mustn't do that ! You hurt the,&#xD;
cat !"&#xD;
"Oh no!" replied the innocent, pushing off the last&#xD;
victim; "Kittie loves for jump."&#xD;
"C lever boy that is, born to evil as the sparks are to fly&#xD;
upward," commended Blash. " Now I'll tell you a story&#xD;
about my cat: she lost her own infants and she brought&#xD;
up a puppy, and was as kind as could be to it."&#xD;
"Ah! how many mothers have brought up puppies,&#xD;
without the necessity of adopting them," said Augusta.&#xD;
"I wish you would stop that stream of talk, Guss,"'re-&#xD;
plied Blush pointedly. " I can't get a word in edgewise"&#xD;
"Yes, dam it Gussey," put in Precious Plunket, pausing,&#xD;
with a broom in his hand, to have a fling at her.&#xD;
"For shame, Mr. Plunket! such profanity," answered&#xD;
Augusta, rolling up her eyes.&#xD;
" Oh, by no means; only a cursory remark. I'll tell you&#xD;
a secret," said Blush; "Gussey is such a talker,. that I&#xD;
am obliged to contradict her, to, make the conversation'&#xD;
general."&#xD;
"What is all this, confusion of tongues?" asked Jenny&#xD;
Bellenger, stopping and putting an arm around Augusta's&#xD;
waist; ."it sounds like a young Babel. I'm out of sorts.&#xD;
I've muddied my boots in your dirty path. I wish you&#xD;
would mend your ways out here."&#xD;

"Well the pish! is written all over you with exclama-&#xD;

9F Bless me, here is one of the small Orowfeet in tears,"&#xD;
interrupted Augusta. "What's the matter, Sis-poor little&#xD;
Sis; go let me weep; there's luxury in tears!"&#xD;
"I've broke the sugar basket that I wanted to give to&#xD;
Buddie Rose, and now he won't like me."&#xD;
"Pshaw! Sis, friends bought with gifts are no good.&#xD;
Virtues and graces are what win the boys. Now stop cry-&#xD;
ing, and. I'll make you a present of this sugar kiss. I&#xD;
bought it for Blush Beach, but he don't deserve it. You&#xD;
shall bestow it upon Buddie."&#xD;
"Well, Gussie, give it me; I have stopped now!"&#xD;
"Oh no, Sis, you haven't done crying yet; look at those&#xD;
two great tears just droppingI!"&#xD;
" Oh! those are some left over from last time ; I haven't&#xD;
started any new ones."&#xD;
They all laughed, and insisted that Sis had faiy earned&#xD;
her kiss, which Augusta hastened to bestow, adding a real&#xD;
one, from her fresh lips, at which Precious began'to .snap&#xD;
his fingers and sing,&#xD;
"'Akiss ! a kiss ! what is a kiss ?&#xD;
The ruby lips are thine love ; the kissing of them, mine love ;&#xD;
Ah, who will kiss those ruby lips when I am gone away?'&#xD;
"that is a college song," explained he at the end.&#xD;
" Oh, you are singing it, trying to feel yourself a Fresh.-&#xD;
ian-I advise you to keep it for college use. I don't&#xD;
think much of it.-Hush! here comes the minister."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," said June Rose, " just in time for supper ; trust&#xD;
him for that. I hope his duties will call him home early.&#xD;
We can't have any good time while he stays ; he is a reg-&#xD;
ular kill-joy, with his long face. What do you suppose&#xD;
he said to me once, when he came'to our house and heard&#xD;
me singing?$ He patted me on my head and croaked out,&#xD;
'What a pity it would be if that voice should have to&#xD;
wail in hell!' There's a cheerful sentiment for a morn-&#xD;
ing call, I think."&#xD;
" Oh if we could only have our dear Mr. Goodlove&#xD;
back again. We never felt afraid of doing wrong when&#xD;
he was here, because he trusted us and helped us out.&#xD;
For my part, I always feel as if I was doomed, every&#xD;
time Dr. llardbake looks at me."&#xD;
The five hostesses made haste to welcome the holy&#xD;
person; they felt a sort of catholic reverence for any&#xD;
man in the priestly office upon the ground, that if he wasn't&#xD;
a good liver, he ought to be; and must not be spoken ill of&#xD;
while he ministered in sacred things; and they were con-&#xD;
scientiously careful of depreciating him in any way. Dr.&#xD;
Hardbake, being a strong Calvinist, which is called "old&#xD;
school," had especially their confidence and sympathy,&#xD;
on account of his way of grinding out and pounding&#xD;
in the' repellant dogmas of his creed, which, I suppose,&#xD;
they accepted for the same reason that a Romanist wears&#xD;
sackcloth: the more repulsive, the greater merit in'the&#xD;

"you can do it ; you'll be damned, if you don't," and&#xD;
"you can't stir a peg, everything being foreordained and.&#xD;

souls went groping up and down, trying to pick out and&#xD;
sift something saving from the dead dust.&#xD;
Having been ceremoniously conducted to the head of.&#xD;
the table, which had been quickly spread after the work&#xD;
was done, the divine ran his eyes down the loaded'&#xD;
board in pleased contemplation of the doughnuts, jum..&#xD;
bles, wonders, miracles, biscuits, jams, preserves, tongues,&#xD;
turkeys, jellied chickens, and the like, which -always&#xD;
make the staple of a true country supper ; and he snuffed&#xD;
the aroma of the coffee, and felt decidedly glad that he&#xD;
had come, and lost no time in saying the requisite "grace,"&#xD;
which blessing from such lips is as efficacious as a cross&#xD;
of holy water from a reverend father's consecration.&#xD;
Dr. Hardbake was as fond of sweets as a bear, and was&#xD;
accustomed to devour them in solitude, and would growl&#xD;
at an interruption in a perfectly bruinish manner. His&#xD;
wife always left a great spoon beside her sweetmeat jars,&#xD;
that he might retire down cellar and sip at his leisure.&#xD;
Very likely he said his prayers down there also; he often'&#xD;
tarried.long enough, to lift one of his petitions which on&#xD;
Sunday took in the whole Christian scheme having all&#xD;
his dogmas laid and. lapped on ; besides much gratui-&#xD;
tous information to the Deity, showing how learned Dr.&#xD;
Hardbake was in the theology of his sect, which seemed&#xD;
to make the after-sermon almost stipplementary.&#xD;
"Come! take my jug-handle, and let's go and get some&#xD;
hash," proposed Pom Blossom to Orchis, who fixed on&#xD;
him puzzled eyes, desiring to be polite, but utterly&#xD;
abroad as to his meaning.&#xD;
".ie offers his flipper," exclaimed Precious, laughing.&#xD;
"This," crooking his elbow. "Much obliged, Pom, but&#xD;
you. see Miss Dunwreath is engaged. Now just put your&#xD;
hand on my arm, and we will go to the table and I'll try&#xD;
&#xD;
to get you something nice. You don't understand boy-&#xD;
talk much, do you?"&#xD;
"No, nor boys. I feel quite. strange. I never was in&#xD;
a gathering like this before in my life, and we live so&#xD;
apart, that we might as well be out of the world entirely."&#xD;
Oh, no, indeed! don't say that, you look as if you&#xD;
could take a good place; and I know you will. Now&#xD;
may I give you a cup of coffee?"&#xD;
"No, thank you, I never drank a cup of coffee. .1 am&#xD;
afraid I should not like it."&#xD;
"Well some of thel4ongue, then, and a biscuit."&#xD;
"No, I am not hungry; I have eaten my supper."&#xD;
""You must take .one just for sociability, Orchis," said&#xD;
Blush, who came along with a heaping plate as white and&#xD;
light as feathers. "Bread, is the staff of life."&#xD;
"'But man cannot live on bread alone," said Jane Rose.&#xD;
"Oh take care, Presh; that's my best corn!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Blush.&#xD;
"Never mind," put in Augusta, "pain nourishes the&#xD;
men; it says so in my French reader."&#xD;
" I wish Precious would follow Bible teaching, and go&#xD;
down to Egypt after corns hereafter."&#xD;
"A. Bunyan's pilgrim," suggested Precious.&#xD;

bright ways of the young America -about her. "Hush!&#xD;

Yes, you see the dentist didn't charge me anything&#xD;
for pulling out my teeth, so I couldn't screech nor make&#xD;
a mite of noise ; it wouldn't seem grateful, when he was&#xD;
doing the job for nothing. Peculiar, ain't it?&#xD;
"Very, ma'am," lied the young man.    "I think&#xD;
I see a friend over there; I'll speak to him. Excuse&#xD;
me, ma'am."    ,.     .&#xD;
As the speaker edged away, the spinster addressed her-&#xD;
self to the minister, who was busy with a plate full of&#xD;
goodips.&#xD;
ell1" said she, "Doctor, how do you get along suit-&#xD;
;ing the people here?".&#xD;
"Suiting, ma'am! " replied the divine, gulping the&#xD;
last of a doughnut. "I didn't come here to suit !"&#xD;
"Pray, what did you come for? . You'll have a mighty&#xD;
poor time if you don't suit, I can tell you."&#xD;
"I came to preach to them, to instruct them, to save&#xD;
souls !"&#xD;
" Oh, you did!. Well, there's thirty old maids in the&#xD;
parish, and if you can preach, instruct, and save all of 'em,&#xD;
you are a good deal spryer man, than you look to be.&#xD;
Maybe you will, when needle has eyes on the pints; not&#xD;
afore."&#xD;
"4Do you calculate to try to save the whole parish,&#xD;
Doctor, or only the elect? "tasked Mr. Blossom.&#xD;
" I wish my ma had me at home ; I don't, feel pretty&#xD;
well," said Precious Plunket. "There's going to be a&#xD;
row."&#xD;
"I fully explained the means of grace in last Sunday's&#xD;
sermon," said the Doctor severely. He had no intention&#xD;
of disturbing his enjoyment -by polemical discourse.&#xD;
"That's so, Doctor," replied Mr. Blossom laughing,&#xD;
"and in the' long prayer beforehand too. .There's a time&#xD;

for everything, and this is the time to eat and drink and&#xD;
be merry, isn't it? Take another cup of coffee. Let me&#xD;
pass your dish."&#xD;
" He has had four already," said Augusta. "But if he&#xD;
will only fill up and go home, I shall be glad."&#xD;
By this time Miss Petingill .had edged round to Mrs.&#xD;
Crowfoot, who was eating her supper comfortably in a&#xD;
corner. "Poor old Shindy died last night," said she.&#xD;
"They had a post-morbid examination, and his heart was&#xD;
all gone; you could shake it just like a han-ker-chef.&#xD;
His; legs swelled up and busted, and hadn't no feeling&#xD;
at all into 'em. I went over afore I come. I told Wit-&#xD;
helmina I wouldn't have it to say, I hadn't never been be-&#xD;
fore he' died. Folks ought to be neighborly, and kinder&#xD;
keep the run of things."&#xD;
"How dreadful to tell me such a thing at supper,"&#xD;
said the niek Miss Crowfoot, aside. "I really cannot&#xD;
relish my turkey any more."&#xD;
"Law me ! do listen to that Rose over there! " re-&#xD;
marked Miss Petingill, who was "kinder" keeping the run&#xD;
of things in that gentleman's direction. "What a brag-&#xD;
ging critter he is!  Three brothers come over in the&#xD;
"May Flower." Land sakes! if all the three brothers had&#xD;
come over in that ship, that claims to, there wouldn't have&#xD;
been no room- for Miles Standish's dinner-pot.  Them&#xD;
Roses come with axes on their shoulders anyhow, and&#xD;
they had to use 'em too, on any job they could get. Poor&#xD;
as Job's turkey, all on 'em;. I know his folks."&#xD;
Mr. Rose heard the spinster's unpleasant speech, and&#xD;
turned quite red. "It makes little difference, who or&#xD;
what our grandfathers were, so we do our parts well.&#xD;
One of the descendants of the three Roses did good ser-&#xD;
vide in the revolutionary war, and was a chosen friend of&#xD;

"Land sakes! you needn't spunk up so; I hain't said&#xD;
nothing agin 'em. 'Taint no matter if your gran-ma was&#xD;
married out of Judge Bloom's kitchen. And there's&#xD;
your brother Sam. I remember as if'it was-yesterday,&#xD;
the day he was twenty-one ; how one of the girls looked&#xD;
out of the winder and said: 'There goes Sam Rose&#xD;
with his freedom suit on.' Dreadful rich now ; owns a&#xD;
bank, and rides in his kirridge. Let's see; he married&#xD;
Jane Mosely; she worked in the same bindery along of&#xD;
him, didn't she?"&#xD;
"I feel as if I had better be getting home," said Mr.&#xD;
Harebell.  "I am -afraid my turn may come next.&#xD;
There was an ancestor of ours hung in colony times for&#xD;
stealing kegs of small beer. I wonder if she knows it;&#xD;
there she is looking at me."&#xD;
"Courage, my friend ; see e'en the slight Harebell&#xD;
raise his head, elastic from her airy tread."&#xD;
Slight ! two hundred if I am a pound. But I must&#xD;
go; my wife always scolds me when I am out late."&#xD;
"When I think my wife is going to scold, I always go&#xD;
=in tearing mad myself, and that scares her out of it.&#xD;
Don't it, Patience, my dear ? "&#xD;
"For shame, Amaranth," replied the comely wife, all&#xD;
unrufflied. "Such nonsense you men do talk, to be sure !"&#xD;
You know it's as true as preaching, truer than some&#xD;
of Hardbake's," winking over at the divine, who was just&#xD;
out of ear-shot. "Don't look so cross at me, Miss Mar-&#xD;
gery; what have I done? I don't care so much about&#xD;
the men. I can fight my way among my peers, but when&#xD;
a woman knits her brows at me, I feel like knocking my&#xD;
head against a stone wall."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BUSY BEE.1&#xD;
"Not so bad 4s that, Mr. Blossom. I confess, I a"&#xD;
little grieved to hear you speak so slightingly of those&#xD;
set over us in holy things.  You remember what St.&#xD;
Paul says, 'Speak not evil of dignities.'"&#xD;
"That's where St. Paul and I differ, Miss Margery, as&#xD;
the old Scotch wife told her parson, when he reminded&#xD;
her that the apostle had forbidden women to talk in meet-&#xD;
ing. Here, Rugby," he added, catching that person by&#xD;
the arm, and giving him a little shake ; "what are you&#xD;
doing free gymnastics to such an extent in this cheerful&#xD;
group for?"&#xD;
"Was I" replied Mr. Rugby, looking sheepish.&#xD;
"The fact is, I have just come from court, where I paid&#xD;
twenty dollars for knocking a fellow down, and I was&#xD;
thinking I'd willingly give twenty more to get another&#xD;
clip at him."&#xD;
" There's depravity for you, Miss Margery !" exclaimed&#xD;
Mr. Blossom, laughing. "Who was it, Rugby ? "&#xD;
"Payson, of Sandy Creek; a disagreeable,'captious&#xD;
chap."&#xD;
"Oh, I know him; went to school with him in the old&#xD;
Brick. He tried to carry home Patience's dinner-basket&#xD;
one day. I knocked him down for nothing. His mother&#xD;
was a milliner ; they said the wind used to blow off the&#xD;
crowns of her bonnets; and the boys used to square up to&#xD;
him and call out, ' Who says bandbox,' when they wanted&#xD;
to plague him. Yes, Miss Margery, boys as a rule are&#xD;
dreadful hectors. I never got plagued much, though."&#xD;
Meanwhile Blush had edged in aniongst them, in pur-&#xD;
suit of goodies for Candace, whom he was politely attend-&#xD;

".Oh yes ! very much indeed-"&#xD;
"I wish I was apple-sass," was his drawling answer.&#xD;
" I was going to say I wouldn't take any, if you had&#xD;
let me finish; I've had sauce enough for this evening."&#xD;
"You don't get much ahead of her, do you IBlush?"&#xD;
said Mr. Blossom, looking pleasantly at the sisters; "she'll&#xD;
go you one better every time. I wonder if I am too -old&#xD;
to be introduced to those pretty girls?$ "&#xD;
"No indeed, papa," replied Augusta; "you'll never be&#xD;
too old for anything nice. This is Candaee Dunwreath,&#xD;
and this is Orchis, and they are both my friends; so&#xD;
make a nice bow, papa, and say you'll be good to their.&#xD;
My papa's goodness is something awful nice."&#xD;
"Oh ho!" was all the answer the jolly farmer made,&#xD;
as he looked curiously at the strangers.&#xD;
"Now I know what you are thinking, only you are too&#xD;
good-natured to say it out loud as the rest have done!"&#xD;
spoke up Candace blushing red, but with a defiant toss&#xD;
of her curly head.&#xD;
"What is it, chick?"&#xD;
"You are thinking, ' Oh ho! some of the old maids." '&#xD;
"Not precisely, my dear. I was wondering why peo-&#xD;
ple should fix the old upon such youthful beauties as&#xD;
you are."&#xD;
"There! Candace; didn't I tell you my papa was nice.&#xD;
She is coming to our house; I have got her to promise;&#xD;
and Orchis will say yes too before we go home."&#xD;
"That's right, Gussie; I'd rather have blooming girls&#xD;
than roses. We'll make good times for them, won't we&#xD;
mother ? When shall it be, Miss Orchis ?"&#xD;
I do not know at present," answered Orchis thought-&#xD;
fully. "I should be glad to have it soon; we must make&#xD;
a beginning."'&#xD;

"Yes, yes, my dear, it is high time we were on better&#xD;
terms. Gus is a good honest girl; you will like Gus;&#xD;
and there's our Porn; he is not a lad to be despised."&#xD;
"I do not despise anybody," replied Orchis plainly,&#xD;
while Candace interposed a laughing reply, and pulled&#xD;
her sister away.&#xD;
Mr. Blossom talked all the way home of Gussy's new&#xD;
friends, and his wife -was not a mite jealous! What do&#xD;
you think of that? ye husbands, who dare not speak of a&#xD;
female acquaintance in your lilpmate's hearing!&#xD;
After the; supper was cleared away, and the minister&#xD;
gone, and some of the elder people, Precious, who had&#xD;
been hard at work, came back to Orchis, who stood apart&#xD;
in a sort of maze. She had scarcely spoken a dozen&#xD;
words, but she felt as if she had so much to remember&#xD;
and think about, that-her head was dizzy The  boy-talk,&#xD;
and fun, the pleasant mingling of old and young, the&#xD;
neighborly jokes, and understanding of each other, th&#xD;
discussing of family matters, comparing notes, the evi-&#xD;
dent good fellowship, hearty mirth, the merry chattering&#xD;
of the young people, was more than she could compre-&#xD;
hend.&#xD;
There was Precious during the bee, snapping seeds all&#xD;
over the room, and getting'sharp words for his pains,&#xD;
balancing cores on his knife-blade, and jerking them into&#xD;
other baskets; Augusta accosting everybody that came in&#xD;
her way ; May and June Rose talking and laughing ;&#xD;
Saucy Blush getting his hair pulled for his impudence,&#xD;
and the blooming Miss Effie gliding about among the guests,&#xD;
smiling, pleasant, making her friends comfortable, and&#xD;
while Candace seemed to slip into a good place in the&#xD;
very midst of it all, Orciis. felt shy, restrained, silent,&#xD;
and when the games began, she retired to a corner, desir-&#xD;

ing to get out of the way of' the noisy frolic ; and that&#xD;
was where Precious sought her out, and asked her to put&#xD;
seeds on her eyelids for naming.&#xD;
She closed her eyes at once as soon as she comprehended&#xD;
what he desired, and did as she was told. After the&#xD;
three regulation winks, she opened them wide and fixed&#xD;
them inquiringly upon him.&#xD;
"Many a thought she thunk, many a wink she wunk,"&#xD;
said Blush as he darted by.&#xD;
"I do not understand," said Orchis; "what does he&#xD;
mean ? "&#xD;
"Nothing but nonsense, Miss Dunwreath. Now you&#xD;
must tell me who you named the right eye ; the seed&#xD;
dropped first from that one ; and if it is the same name&#xD;
I gave it, then he is to be your sweetheart."&#xD;
The word kindled a little flush on her cheeks; that was&#xD;
what Blush Beach desired to be to Candace. "I thought&#xD;
your name," she replied simply.&#xD;
"Did you?" said Precious, blushing at. the straight-&#xD;
forward directness of her truthful confession; "I wish I&#xD;
had too; but I don't know as I should have dared. You&#xD;
see, we fellows don't like to seem to feel too big of our-&#xD;
selves. I thank you though, ever so much."&#xD;
"You need not ; I doh't know anybody else except&#xD;
Candace's friend, and if I did, it would not make any&#xD;
difference."&#xD;
"You have a. way of your own of speaking your mind,&#xD;
haven't you? ":said Pi-ecious, more flattered than he liked&#xD;
to show; " I admire it."&#xD;
"Do you? I am glad! I suppose I do not talk like&#xD;
other folks; but you must remember that Inever see any-&#xD;
body except my sisters; and we all speak the truth."&#xD;
"Of course ; so do I. Come now, let's-'try paring for&#xD;

what letter it will make. I am going for a D, and I hope,&#xD;
yours will be a P."&#xD;

askzedOrchis, looking in his face with her clear eyes.&#xD;
"Certainly, Miss Orchis; that is the idea."&#xD;
" And then will I be your sweetheart"&#xD;
"That is the game," replied Precious much embar-&#xD;
rassed, "but I don't suppose it always turns out that way!"&#xD;
"Here they are," called out Blush coming up with&#xD;
Candace on his arm; "have you tried it?"&#xD;
"Not yet," replied Precious; "I have been explaining&#xD;
the trick to Miss Orchis."&#xD;
" Wait till you see ours. Bravo! there it is! as good a&#xD;
D as a sign painter could make. Now Candace, send.&#xD;
yours, and be sure you get a plain B."&#xD;
"Look !" exclaimed Candace triumphantly; "is not&#xD;
that perfect."&#xD;
"We are all right; I shall have to do that bit of carv-&#xD;
ing .I see."&#xD;
"Will you try now, Miss Orchis?" asked Precious of&#xD;
the girl who stood silent, looking at eachin turn, as she&#xD;
held the red apple in her hand.&#xD;
"I had rather not," she answered; "it seems to -me&#xD;
not pleasant ; I might fail again ; it is like tempting&#xD;
fortune."&#xD;
She looked so serious, so wholly unconscious of the&#xD;
value of her words, that Precious did not know what to&#xD;
say, and he was spared the trouble of saying anything by&#xD;
Augusta, who exclaimed:&#xD;
"Pooh! they're bound to be B's or S's; I've tried a&#xD;
thousand times, and they all look exactly alike."&#xD;

" That'% a mistake, Gus, as you see there," pointing to&#xD;
the ruby ribbon, which Precious had dropped over his&#xD;
shoulder, while .she, spoke. "If that is not a D, I never&#xD;
saw one in the spelling-book."&#xD;
" That's so," said Candace.; "and as there is'a whole&#xD;
family of us, he can take his choice."&#xD;
" You are ruled out, if you please, Miss Candace," said&#xD;
Blush. "No flirting; I shan't allow it."&#xD;
Precious had merry words enough in general, and was&#xD;
quite apt to make sufficient of himself, but he could not&#xD;
open his lips to trifle, with Orchis looking at him, and he&#xD;
stooped and picked up his fate-letter, and tore it absently&#xD;
into shreds.&#xD;
"I must go," said Augusta. "I can't have that billing&#xD;
and cooing between June and my Porn; those Roses are&#xD;
not to my liking."&#xD;
"Who is building and cooking?2." inquired Effie.&#xD;
"This man coining in at the door; he lays up walls for&#xD;
a few which keep out the many, and lie preaches a cook-&#xD;
ing that is going to last forever. No wonder he looks&#xD;
as if he got drunk every night, and repented every morn-&#xD;
ing&#xD;
"Blush, I am ashamed of you; how very wicked&#xD;
That is the new Baptist minister; a hard-working, earnest&#xD;
man; of course it is a great pity he is close-communion"&#xD;
"He is looking for a wife, Miss Effie," said Augusta;&#xD;
" there he goes straight up, to Margery."&#xD;
"And much good may it do him," muttered Effie,&#xD;
watching him. "Margery isn't the sort of woman to live&#xD;
in a. chest with the lid down; Balquither is no place for&#xD;
haim."&#xD;
"Oh dear," sighed Augusta, "why don't somebody&#xD;
conie after mel I know it will be my fate to go out&#xD;
&#xD;
West and be a missionary, and teach prairie dogs to stand&#xD;
on their hind-legs."&#xD;
" How would that suit you, Miss Orchis ?" asked Eflie&#xD;
smiling at the. silent girl who listened while the others&#xD;
talked. "You are not so lively as your sister."&#xD;
Orchis looked across at Candace, who had by this&#xD;
time got into the midst of "button, button, who's got&#xD;
the button," bright, sunny, talkative, and as pretty as a&#xD;
peach.&#xD;
"I like to see Candace happy," said she, softly finger-&#xD;
ing the apple she still held. "I think my sister is as&#xD;
handsome as any girl here."&#xD;
" She is indeed, and as winsome as she is handsome;&#xD;
you are very fond of her, are you not?$"&#xD;
" Oh yes: she is mine, I am hers; she is beauty, I am&#xD;
beast.'&#xD;
"Will it always be the same, do you think?"&#xD;
"What do you mean, Miss Effie? Why should it be&#xD;
changed?." asked Orchis uneasily.&#xD;
"Oh, she might marry after a while, you know, and&#xD;
then she would be all her husband's, and you only&#xD;
second-best ; that is my experience. Ihad a friend once,&#xD;
all mine, but as soon as she was a wife, she was so&#xD;
changed, so indifferent, and my love of so little conse-&#xD;
quece, tl at I had to give her up."&#xD;
irchis looked again ; Precious Plunket was standing&#xD;
close to Candace now; she and Effie were left together ;&#xD;
he was laughing, she was talking, her face arch and&#xD;
vivacious, and it seemed that his whole attention was&#xD;
given to her, and Blush was also offering her the magic&#xD;
button.&#xD;

Don't begin to look so miserable beforehand," said&#xD;
Effie, laughing. "That is a nice old song,-our mother'&#xD;
used to sing it,-and true of, wedded love; but outside&#xD;
that there is large room for a 'great sisterhood; who are&#xD;
the' real workers of this world, despised and ridiculed&#xD;
as they may be. It is the aunties who are the stand-bys.&#xD;
We are a family of single women here at Balquither, and&#xD;
we find enough to do; we are free and independent. I&#xD;
must have a good talk with you, dear Orchis."&#xD;
"And will you go through your life alone?"&#xD;
"Not alone, Orchis; no husband, but hosts of friends,&#xD;
hosts of interests."&#xD;
"But these families I have seen to-night seem so&#xD;
bappy,-the fathers, and mothers, and the children, the&#xD;
Blossoms and the Roses. I never thought about it&#xD;
before; now I know a round circle full of joys is better&#xD;
than a still line untrodden by any feet but mine. Sister&#xD;
Polly talked just as you do to Candace. I think it would&#xD;
be easier to tarry behind our. fences, as we have done,&#xD;
than to come out into a world where people get paired, if&#xD;
I do not find my .mate."&#xD;
"Why, Oruhis dear.! such a sweet, good girl as you are&#xD;
is likely tojind enough if you choose to take."&#xD;
"You are a handsome girl and you have not found,"&#xD;
answered Orchis plainly.&#xD;
"I don't desire to find; I like my life as it is," said&#xD;
Effie' smiling. "I must show you my flowers and my&#xD;
birds, and how I fill up my time."&#xD;
"Flowers and birds are not human interests," answered&#xD;
Orchis, shaking her head. " They are not enough."&#xD;

After he was gone, Effie looked at her and found her&#xD;
smiling. "Why are you so pleased? " she asked.&#xD;
"I think you are not cut out for an old maid either,&#xD;
Miss Effie. That man looked sweet at you, and you&#xD;
looked just as sweet at him; -he pleases you more than&#xD;

"Pooh child! I have to be polite in my own house,"&#xD;

ried away.&#xD;
Orchis was still thinking about her, when Precious came&#xD;
and asked her to play stage-coach.&#xD;
"I don't think I could; it is so bewildering, all the noise&#xD;
and the bustle; and it seems to me as if nobody here said&#xD;
their true thoughts. They all hide something. Even you&#xD;
are afraid to tell just your feelings."&#xD;
"What makes you think so, Miss Orchis? I call'myself&#xD;
a remarkably honest fellow. I see you have the apple&#xD;
yet; it is not the apple of discord, that you cherish so&#xD;
carefully."&#xD;
'"What is that.?"&#xD;
"Did you never hear the story?"&#xD;
"Never ! I have heard nothing ; I know nothing."&#xD;
"You know enough to say plenty of sharp things, I&#xD;
observe. Come, if you choose, we will sit down in this&#xD;
corner and I'll tell you about the awful red streak which&#xD;
made lots of trouble."&#xD;
"I think I had rather hear about your hone, and&#xD;

"My mother says a great deal, Miss Orchis; she is a&#xD;
real mother. I should like to have you see her; she&#xD;
knows just how and when to help a fellow. Now,-what&#xD;
I like best to do, I can answer that in a jiffy: I am&#xD;
fonder of study and reading than anything else, but I don't&#xD;
get much time; my father is great for buying land, and&#xD;
land must be worked, you know. 1 mean to teach school&#xD;
this winter; mother and I agree that it will be good for me."&#xD;
You teach school?"&#xD;
"Yes, why not?  Don't you think I know enough?"&#xD;
"'Anybody could teach me," replied Orchis sighing.&#xD;
I h iven't. seen the inside of a school-room since I was&#xD;
eleven years,old, or looked in a book scarcely. How nice&#xD;
it would be if I could go to school; then perhaps I could&#xD;
teach, and that would be an outlet."&#xD;

" For your patience, yes. Come to me, Miss Orchis.&#xD;
I'll make you study like the blazes. I'm going to ferrule&#xD;
all the girls who don't get their lessons."&#xD;
" What is that? 'ferrule,' I never heard of it?"&#xD;
" Hold out your hand, and I'll show you."&#xD;
Orchis presented her little palm, looking in the young&#xD;
man's face inquiringly. He took it in his great brown&#xD;
fingers, made a horrible grimace, lifted his right arm as&#xD;
for a frightful blow, and laid his hand softly upon the one&#xD;
he held, with a half shy laugh.&#xD;
" I couldn't have the heart to hurt such a girl as you&#xD;
are," said he. "Your eyes which trust me make -it impos-&#xD;
sible; no, I shall have to set you over amongst the boys&#xD;
when you are idle; I will take care to pick out small&#xD;
ones.&#xD;
Orchis locked the released digits in close clasp of their&#xD;
fellows, and-fell off into musing. "What if I have really&#xD;
found the key to the new life which I need," thought&#xD;
she, and her sober face made Precious afraid she was of-&#xD;
fended, and he said, rather hesitatingly:&#xD;
"Don't get angry, Miss Orchis ; I meant only non-&#xD;
sense."&#xD;
"Angry with you! oh no, I was wondering if I could&#xD;
really go to your school; I shall certainly try to make it&#xD;
out." She finished with a set face as firm as Clytie's own:&#xD;
"and Candace shall come also. I don't know how I shall&#xD;
accomplish it, but I shall."&#xD;
"I suppose the rest will laugh at us," she went on&#xD;
thinking aloud.  "I have heard some of these people&#xD;
talking of my clothes this evening and making unkind&#xD;
remarks;: but that- does not matter; we live as we must.&#xD;
It is true, I am quite differently dressed from these other'&#xD;
girls; I see it. I didn't know how different till this even-&#xD;

ing!" she glanced at Candace in her blue crape as she&#xD;
spoke. " I don't think I mind. Pet will; she'll cry about&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"There is not a nicer looking lady in the room than&#xD;
you are," said Precious, warmly.  "I wish everybody&#xD;
would leave off their fussiness. My mother never wears&#xD;
any, and she always looks like a, brick; I mean she looks&#xD;
good."&#xD;
"I thank you; I like plain clothes myself, I believe,&#xD;
although I do not wear them from choice, but because I&#xD;
have no others. That won't hinder our being laughed at&#xD;
by your scholars."&#xD;
"Just 'let me catch them at it ! No, Miss Orchis, I.&#xD;
mean to give such a tone to my school, that dress won't&#xD;
count; standing is what is going to tell. I have talked it&#xD;
over with my mother and thought a great deal about it,&#xD;
and I have a fixed idea of what a study-place ought to&#xD;
be, and I intend to carry it out. Mother thinks I can, and&#xD;
I know it."&#xD;
"Your mother is' also your friend, I see," said Orchis,&#xD;
with the clear penetration of the young man's character,&#xD;
which is intuitive in women, who know a great many&#xD;
things by instinct without learning them. " You honor and&#xD;
love her entirely."&#xD;
"I do so," answered Precious, blushing: not from&#xD;
false shame, but a strange pleasure in being understood,&#xD;
in the sympathy she showed, and- the interest she made&#xD;
no effort to conceal; and he felt that to be a friend to&#xD;
Orchis Dunwreath, it would be essential to be sincere and&#xD;
candid enough to dwell in the palace of truth.&#xD;
Old Miss Petingill ambled up and interrupted their&#xD;
conversation. She had prevailed upon her cousin Parish&#xD;
to stay, saying: "There ain't nothing I do enjoy so much&#xD;
&#xD;

makes me feel young again,; I vum if it don't."&#xD;
"lumph! Almira. If you get to feelin' young,. it&#xD;
must be because you are gettin' on to your second chil-&#xD;
hood."&#xD;
"We'll rin about the burn and paddle in the brays&#xD;
together, Wilhelmina; that is a great comfort."&#xD;
When these two set out for a "sparring match," it was&#xD;
difficult to say which would get the best of it. Miss&#xD;
Petingill carried her point this evening, remained&#xD;
through the games, and said anything she happened to&#xD;
think of, regardless who it hit, as usual. She got some wry&#xD;
faces and cold shoulders from the groups intent on their&#xD;
own pleasure. Youth is generally intolerant of age, not&#xD;
always.&#xD;
"I'm glad to get a chance to see you, I declare," said&#xD;
she to Orchis. "I've heard tell so much about your&#xD;
goings on, cuttin' round anyhow, doin' man's work; 'old&#xD;
maids' they call you. They might say maiden ladies if&#xD;
'they was a mind to be civil, when they spoke of single&#xD;
women.   I thought there was enough on 'em where I&#xD;
come from, but I own it beats all how they do swarm&#xD;
round here; meaner'n pusley, too, some on 'em. Why&#xD;
they say the new Baptist ministersthought he'd got a new&#xD;

"Both, I believe, ma'am," answered Blush politely, who&#xD;
had just come up with Candace on his arm, all heated&#xD;
and rosy with her lively game of blind-man.&#xD;
"Law ! ain't you the chap I seen ridin' down the road&#xD;
on a centipede ?"exclaimed Miss Petingill, tilting up her&#xD;
glasses with her thumb and finger to bring their focus&#xD;
on him.&#xD;
"Velocipede, Almiry," suggested Cousin Parish tartly ;&#xD;
"don't make a laughing stock of yourself, I beg."&#xD;
If I didn't know you was a widder, I should take you&#xD;
for an old maid, Wilhelminy, you are so pesky snap-&#xD;
pish.- I s'pose that is Jerusha Perkins' man she's hanging&#xD;
onto. Well! if she ain't sprigged up to fits ! but law! she&#xD;
left the ranks too late to take any good looks with her;&#xD;
she ought to jumped the fence sooner. What a sunday-&#xD;
best look all her things has got. They do say a man never&#xD;
feels as if he owned his wife, till he's bought. her a new&#xD;
gown."&#xD;
"You ought to have made some good man happy, Miss&#xD;
Petingill," said Blush with a smile.&#xD;
"Think so, bub? well I thought I should, when I was&#xD;
as young as you; every girl does, they all look forward&#xD;
to it. I had a beau, but he went out amongst the Inj ins,&#xD;
and the, cannibals et him up, so that was the end on't.&#xD;
Pve done tailorin' ever since, and I always expect to, till&#xD;
I get t'other side ; then I mean to take a good spell the&#xD;

"That's what the old slave said," remarked Blush,&#xD;
" when his master asked him what he meant to busy him-&#xD;
self with when he got to heaven. 'I'll jes res massa,'&#xD;

said he. Good old nigger! what lots of fun I had with&#xD;

"Air you two twins?" inquired Miss Petingill; who&#xD;
had been studying Orchis and Candace.&#xD;
"No," replied Candace, "Vashti and Griselda are&#xD;
twins."&#xD;
"Oh, they are sisters, I s'pose, an't they ? look much&#xD;
alike?&#xD;
"Not very much, I believe; I really never thought&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
So kinder used to seeing 'em round, you don't notice,&#xD;
I dessay."&#xD;
Before the evening was over, all five of the Balquither&#xD;
ladies had taken occasion to converse separately with Or-&#xD;
chis. She had seen the patchwork, looked at the birds and&#xD;
flowers, and gotten a wee blossom to remember the eve-&#xD;
ning by.&#xD;
Miss Margery had spoken again about coming to church,&#xD;
offering her a place in their wagon, and finished by a&#xD;
kiss and a whisper, as she held the girl's hand 'in both&#xD;
hers.&#xD;
" I feel that you need help, dear, and if you will take&#xD;
my advice, you will carry your needs to the minister.&#xD;
He is set over us to aid and comfort, and you ought to&#xD;
seek him at once."&#xD;
Miss Margery was in earnest ; she felt that such was&#xD;
the proper course to take, and would have taken it herself,&#xD;
if a necessity had arisen, to which she did not find her&#xD;
own resources equal.&#xD;
Just before breaking up, Orchis had a puzzle offered&#xD;
her, when Precious came and asked politely, if he might&#xD;
see her home. She was thinking it over, not knowing&#xD;
what answer to make, when Candace rushed at her, and&#xD;

"hSay 'yes, thank you,' do, and be quick or you will of-&#xD;

"Candace, Pet," answered Orchis aloud, and holding&#xD;
her sister off to look in her face, "how can he see me&#xD;
home, when our house is behind that tall fence, and you&#xD;
know Clytie will not let him inside the gate, and we shall&#xD;
have to climb over ourselves."&#xD;
"Never mind, Blush is coming with me ; he said Pre-&#xD;
cious :would speak to you. He will make it all smooth.&#xD;
Say 'yes,' please."&#xD;
I'Yes, please," said Orchis obediently.&#xD;
"And we are much obliged," added Candace, courte-&#xD;
sying.&#xD;
"So are we" added Blush, laughingly imitating her&#xD;
with his short coat-tails.&#xD;
"Yes, of course," said Precious, who had been getting&#xD;
red and proud during the hesitation and colloquy of the&#xD;
sisters ; " I was beginning to feel quite uneasy for fear I&#xD;
should be ruled out."'&#xD;
"UYou need not," replied Orchis very plainly. "1 was&#xD;
waiting till Candace should tell me what to say. No one&#xD;
ever asked me the question before in my life, you must&#xD;
remember."&#xD;
" I shall not forget that I am the first, Miss Orchis; I&#xD;
like it very much. Now take my arm, please."&#xD;
"Is that right ? I do not need any help;,I am able to&#xD;
walk by myself."&#xD;
"Everybody does it, Miss Orchis; see Candace and&#xD;
e        d Augusta is leaning on Tip Crowfoot. They&#xD;
-    o in pairs, so just give me your little hand, and I will&#xD;
put it right here on my sleeve; there, that's right."&#xD;
&#xD;
Orchis was a good walker, and Precious enjoyed that&#xD;
half mile in the moonlight wonderfully. The pressure&#xD;
of the fingers was so light that he had to look down, once&#xD;
in awhile, to make certain they were there, and the con-&#xD;
sciousness' that they had never rested on any other sleeve,&#xD;
was agreeable also. Still the two youngsters and Candace&#xD;
did the laughing and chatting, and Orchis felt dimly two&#xD;
or three times, that Precious was directing most of his&#xD;
remarks to her sister, and it troubled her, and she did not&#xD;
know how to help it either, because they all had so much&#xD;
to say, that anything from her would have been unneces-&#xD;
sary ; she grew serene again, however, when her escort&#xD;
turned smilingly to her, after they had arrived and were&#xD;
standing by the fence for a few last words.&#xD;
" Now, Miss Orchis, don't forget; I shall look for you&#xD;
the first day of school. I count on you. I think we may&#xD;
have such good times studying ; and you must let me&#xD;
manage to bring my mother to speech of you, she is such&#xD;
strong help in hard places."&#xD;
" Here we are !" remarked Blush, "at the foot of the&#xD;
ladder by which angels ascend and descend. You see,&#xD;
these ladies live here alone, and they keep the gate locked&#xD;
for fear of robbers, and I advised the girls to get over&#xD;
the fence and save worry."&#xD;
"That is not quite true," said Orchis; "we would not&#xD;
have been permitted to go out of the gate, and did not&#xD;
ask permission; we went privately, because we thought&#xD;
it right that we should disregard rules."&#xD;
"I am so glad you did, Miss Orchis; I never enjoyed a&#xD;
bee so much in my life, all because you two were there."&#xD;
" I echo the sentiment of the gentleman who spoke last;&#xD;
in the words of the poet I would add, ' wild roved the In-&#xD;
dian girl.'"&#xD;

Who     as she? what did she rove for?" asked Orchis,&#xD;
thinking there must be something in her history which&#xD;
would throw light on their peculiar circumstances.&#xD;
"tYou have me there,"- answered Blush, laughing ; "I&#xD;
see a fellow must not soar too far into 'the realms of&#xD;
fancy, when he talks with you."&#xD;
Orchis was silent, feeling afresh that the boys and&#xD;
girls outside said and did many things she could not com-&#xD;
prebend.&#xD;
"Lam awful glad we went," said Candace. "If all our&#xD;
adventures will be as pleasant as this has been, I hope par-&#xD;
ing-bees will be as plenty as butterflys in August. Here&#xD;
goes the first angel; queer kind of a Paradise to drop into&#xD;
though. .Good-night, Blush. Good-night, Mr. Plunket."&#xD;
The fence was successfully scaled, and the two girls&#xD;
stood safely, alone in their enclosure, listening to the&#xD;
footsteps of their departing friends.&#xD;
"Now if we can only get in," whispered Candace.&#xD;
"Oh dear, there's Ajax !"&#xD;
Still as they were, the rustle and voices had attracted&#xD;
the dog, who was promoted to the watching, vice Toss dis-&#xD;
abled; and he came bounding and leaping, and seized&#xD;
Candace by the skirt which he shook with all his might&#xD;
and main.&#xD;
"Down, good Ajax! dear Ajax don't you know me? You&#xD;
will waken everybody with your horrid noise! awful dog,&#xD;
do pray be quiet! Oh, if you only knew the mischief you&#xD;
are doing, you would be still! "&#xD;
But so intent was, the guardian of the night upon the&#xD;
discharge of his' duty, that it took a minute or so, to make&#xD;
him understand, that his young mistresses were out on a&#xD;
lark ; and when he did get -it into his head, he only inten-&#xD;
sified the occasion, barking, and talking on .vociferously.,&#xD;

" Hateful things!" said Candace half crying, "now&#xD;
look, what trouble you have got us into There's Clytie&#xD;
with a candle, and we're lucky if she don't shoot us be-&#xD;
fore we can put foot inside the house. I told you so ! she&#xD;
has set down the light, and up goes her pistol. Don't&#xD;
fire, Clytie ; it is only Orchis and me !"&#xD;
"What may this mean?"   Clytie waited, till they were&#xD;
close to her, before she said a word, and then she stood&#xD;
still, looking pitilessly at them, while the yellow rays of&#xD;
the candle she had not lifted shone over her, making her&#xD;
an eerie figure.&#xD;
"Nothing much," it was Candace who spoke; "'only&#xD;
we have been to the paring-bee."&#xD;
" It should be a rare pleasure to take you out with such&#xD;
bold disobedience, when there must be a beating at the&#xD;
finish. Get me the whip!&#xD;
"cNo, Clytie," replied Orchis, coming forward, "you&#xD;
shall beat us no more ; we are sisters, not slaves of yours.&#xD;
I have found out for myself that this is a broad world&#xD;
full of honest people, who work and play and meet in&#xD;
,common interests ; and I shall no longer consent to be&#xD;
shut up on this farm, as if it was a prison."&#xD;
As she stepped close to Olytie, you might. have seen&#xD;
how nearly the two -resembled each other. The same&#xD;
clear-cut features, falling shoulders, well-turned limbs,&#xD;
only in Orchis there was a hungry craving for love, a de-&#xD;
sire for hope and faith, which glimmered-in her look of&#xD;
wistful unrest, contrasting strongly with the still quie-&#xD;
tude of hard indifference in the woman, where hope was&#xD;
dead, and love and faith crushed- out. The coloring of&#xD;
the two was as dissimilar as possible. For Clytie's marble&#xD;
whiteness, Orchishad the red of the sunny side of a rir6e&#xD;
peach, and for the dead blackness of smouldering fire i&#xD;

her beautifully shaped eyes, \the younger girl poured&#xD;
glances from orbs of azure, deep as deepest sapphire, and&#xD;
her hair was sunnier, warmer, more golden. Admirably&#xD;
lovely both; very like, and yet absolutely unlike.&#xD;
"Get me the whip," said Olytie again, in a voice ring-&#xD;
ing, tuneful, cold as death.&#xD;
As Candace crept past her to obey, the woman's eyes&#xD;
fell upon the dress she wore, and, she reached out her&#xD;
hand, and caught the skirt in her fingers.&#xD;
".Where did you get this ?" asked she, lifting the candle&#xD;
that she might scan her nearly ; the blue crape, the snood,&#xD;
the kerchief, the knot of ribbon, and its crimson buds, she&#xD;
saw them all. Suddenly the whole woman changed as if&#xD;
she had seen a spirit. A wave of scarlet surged over her,&#xD;
burning painfully, swelling her parted lips with vivid&#xD;
flame, retreating in heavy pulse-beats, dropping into her&#xD;
heart like gouttes of lead, leaving her still, colorless, as&#xD;
they were accustomed to see her, and terribly beautiful.&#xD;
"You have done well to bring me face to face with my&#xD;
shame," said she, "to force me to live the dead past&#xD;
aain"&#xD;
Oh, Clytie! what is it? don't be angry! I'll put&#xD;
them all back!" cried Candace, springing forward. "You&#xD;
may beat, me; I wish you. would."&#xD;
Clytie made no answer, and the child shrank away&#xD;
front her, as she slowly wheeled-about as regardless of&#xD;
her and her voice, as if she were alone, and stepped noise-&#xD;
lessly from them, gliding like a spectre to her chamber,&#xD;
where they heard the clang of the door, the click of the&#xD;

"Is the child going crazy?" asked Vashti, "that she&#xD;

"No, I am not! I shall be, though, if you act so about a&#xD;

"Couldn't you have fetched something else, if you&#xD;

"Why'?" whispered Candace, taking hold of Orchis'&#xD;
hand. "I didn't hurt her things; why should she mur-&#xD;
derme?"&#xD;
"I'll tell you why, child: this is the dress the bride&#xD;
wore the last evening she spent in the company of her&#xD;
troth-plight, who deserted her! the dress in which she&#xD;
waited for him, the night of the terrible day when she&#xD;
learned that the man on whom she had staked her soul&#xD;
was a coward, a wretch ; the night on which she laid&#xD;
down her life, put out her love, and became what you&#xD;
know her, here."&#xD;
"Oh, I wish somebody had told me," moaned Candace&#xD;
turning to Orchis, who stood still and white, listening;&#xD;
Orchis, who holding fast the hand thrust into hers, laid&#xD;
the other arm on the neck of her pet. "Oh!. I wish I&#xD;

fine, and look what a horrid mess I have made. Heaven&#xD;
forgive me ! I'll never go fine any more ; come quickly.&#xD;
and help me put the nasty things out of my sight."&#xD;
Still silent, Orchis went at once. They ascended softly&#xD;
the stairs to the old garret, full of shadows, full of creak-&#xD;
ing noises, hung with cobwebs, stored with household&#xD;
gear, full of memories ; and undoing the box, they laid&#xD;

to have been more firm; I am to blame. Come, forget your&#xD;

her trip to Sister Polly's, and the grand wind-up of the&#xD;
festival just passed, which she minutely described as she&#xD;

adding comments and explanatory notes to her' sister's&#xD;
statements, which filled in . charming, mirthful picture.&#xD;

"A thousand, by my feelings ; and yet you and I are&#xD;

"I see a bold thought in your eyes, my dear double!&#xD;
y'ou are thinking it possible that we also may break&#xD;

his forty years of cell-dom? Come, we must gabble like&#xD;

we will; we havn't forgot how to kiss, though we are'&#xD;

The night was very far spent when they separated, and&#xD;
then the couples prolonged their talk apart. Orchis and&#xD;
Candace had suddenly sprung into importance; they ate&#xD;
their suppers children: now they were positive actors. in&#xD;
life's drama, and their feats opened new trains of thoughtU&#xD;
in the others, or rather gave impetus and method to those&#xD;
long laid ready for springing.&#xD;
Goody Ruddock was the only one who slept through,&#xD;
knowing nothing, feeling nothing of the earthquake&#xD;
which had shaken the place, and consequently she rose&#xD;
at four o'clock as usual, and drove her team afield.&#xD;
The days which followed were chaos. Tongues which&#xD;
had been comparatively silent for so long, or at least'&#xD;
taboed from all but few subjects, broke loose' and ranged;&#xD;

of distant scenes raked up and shared amongst the&#xD;
four, who met on a common ground of wants, which&#xD;
must be recognized and provided for.&#xD;
Clytie was not visible. Early in the morning she w1ent-&#xD;
out with her gun, and when at nightfall she returned,&#xD;
Goody iRuddock was the only 'one who saw her, and she&#xD;
ministered to her as the faithful creature often did, with&#xD;
dumb tenderness, asking and receiving no thanks or&#xD;
welcome.&#xD;
The great gate was unlocked ! The twins did it! It&#xD;
took courage, but they accomplished the feat, while the&#xD;
younger ones stood close by, hand d1asped in hand,&#xD;
watching; and Oandace threw herself on Orchis' neck,&#xD;
when they swung wide, and trembled and wept. It&#xD;
seemed as if all the world would pour in at once, so un-&#xD;
protected, unsheltered did they feel; and when Precious&#xD;
and Blush actually did come, and deliberately walk&#xD;
through the gap, and tread the long path to the house,&#xD;
and knock at the front door, and ask for the young ladies,&#xD;
the whole four turned pale, as if attacked by robbers; it&#xD;
was such an overturn in their lives.&#xD;
.The youths got a welcome, however, and were invited&#xD;
to look at the garden ; the twins returning unconsciously&#xD;
to the habits of their training, and so the lady outdid the&#xD;
farmer, and the bee was talked over, and the school-plan&#xD;
openly discussed, and Griselda especially petted and&#xD;
admired the adventurous heroes, who had been the part-&#xD;
ners and provokers of the tremendous daring the children&#xD;
had bravely carried into success. Shut out from all&#xD;
chance of communication with the other sex for such a&#xD;

steadily, after one 6f their long debates ; "I shall go and&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
ORTHODOXY AT HOME.&#xD;
HE great Dr. llardbake was coming in the train !&#xD;
there hadn't been such a gathering at the depot&#xD;
since Mr. Goodlove took leave of his congregation&#xD;
there, when he stood on the platform holding little&#xD;
Tommy Goodbye by the hand, and followed by the kind&#xD;
thoughts of the lame, the weary, the heavy of heart, and&#xD;
the suffering, who were losing their best friend.&#xD;
But with all his sterling virtues, his excellences as a&#xD;
faithful pastor, a successful in-gatherer, Mr. Goodbye&#xD;
had a terrible fault: he doubted the doctrine of'election ;&#xD;
he dared to believe that Christ died for all, whosoever&#xD;
will, and he thought for himself also upon total depravity&#xD;
and predestination. He was stigmatized as new school&#xD;
and heterodox, and so the poor and needy lost an active&#xD;
helper, and the church a faithful pastor, and the great&#xD;
Dr. Ilardbake was called in his stead.&#xD;
A big-necked,,big-headed man was the divine, with a&#xD;
great shock of stiff hair, shingled into bristles about half d&#xD;
an inch long, clerically dressed in a long-tailed coat,&#xD;
shiny pantaloons, high-lows, blue yarn stockings, and&#xD;
vast white neckcloth. Obstinately dogmatic in character,&#xD;
opinionated, impatient ofd contradiction, intolerant of&#xD;

opponents in creed or government, a thundering preacher&#xD;
both in manner and matter, who dealt largely in wrath,&#xD;
law, threatenings, and .denunciations; so learned, that&#xD;
Hebrew was child's play to him, and as for sanscrit,&#xD;
hieroglyphics and the like small deer, they couldn't&#xD;
make him wink. He would have undertaken to read the&#xD;
writing on the wall to the Babylonish monarch, just as&#xD;
readily as if he had known all about it ; he had a reason&#xD;
for any event, which followed the creation all made out,&#xD;
had.completed an exactscalculation of the times and hal k&#xD;
times of Daniel, and had fitted them into the world's&#xD;
history, so that he was satisfied,and considered "Faber on&#xD;
the prophecies," mere waste paper.&#xD;
He had six great sermons, besides the usual orthodox&#xD;
efforts which he always thundered forth in.order, on tak-&#xD;
ing a fresh field of labor, "The opening of the seven vials&#xD;
of wrath," a fearful discourse, awe-inspiring, gloomy, and&#xD;
grand, and full-of hard words, which drenched the female .&#xD;
portion of the audience in tears, and often promoted wip-&#xD;
ing of noses among the men. Then one onthe bringing up&#xD;
of children,-text, "Spare the rod and spoil the'child"-&#xD;
proving clearly that the more our tenderlings are checked,&#xD;
thwarted, held in hand and restrained, corrected and&#xD;
whipped, they better they must be; and. offering an ex-&#xD;
ample of a worthy parent who was accustomed to allow&#xD;
his daughters to make ready for a festivity and think&#xD;
they were to enjoy it,'till the last minute; when they were&#xD;
ordered to +1 off their fixings and gosto bed, that they'&#xD;
might learn to bear disappointments. Augusta Blossom&#xD;
said such a father- ought to- be hung; and was much&#xD;
stirred to angry thoughts by the divine's evident relish of&#xD;
the tale, and declared, that he was a '" hateful old thing."&#xD;
Mrs. IHardbake also added her mite of good1 doctrine&#xD;
&#xD;
by her lord's leave, and lectured the ladies on all sorts of&#xD;
subjects of which they had the practical knowledge, and&#xD;
she the ignorant presumgon.&#xD;
In fact she was what is called a "good minister's wife,"&#xD;
as if the chosen love of a preacher had any more business&#xD;
to meddle with .the parish than the help-meet of any&#xD;
other gentleman. I remember once hearing of a minister&#xD;
in ripe age, who espoused a youthful bride. His congre-&#xD;
gation were outraged at the disparity of years, and waited&#xD;
by committee upon their pastor, admonishing him of his&#xD;
rashness. After hearing what they had to say, he sent for&#xD;
his wife, who came tripping to his side.&#xD;
"Laura," said he, taking her hand, "are you satisfied&#xD;
with me for a husband?"   "Oh yes, indeed!" replied&#xD;
the bride. "Thank you, Laura, I ani also satisfied with&#xD;
yon. ,Therefore, gentlemen, you will please manage your&#xD;
own affairs and leave us to manage ours. My family is&#xD;
as sacredly mine as any other man's, and I shall -not per-&#xD;
mit interference. I married my wife for myself, and not&#xD;
for my parish.-&#xD;
Mrs. Iardbake once checked a young mother, who was&#xD;
leaving her profitable exhortation to ran and take up her&#xD;
screaming baby.&#xD;
"No Jessamny,.you must not lift the child to your arms&#xD;
every time lie sees fit to cry. Let him have it out alone:&#xD;
it will make a strong character of him."&#xD;
As poor Jessamy was niece to the reverend lady and&#xD;
followed her teachings, her child exhaled into the heavenly&#xD;
sunshine in the strengthening process, where strength is&#xD;
love. When another nursling came to be cared for, she&#xD;
turned the cold shoulder to Aunt Iiardbake and cuddled&#xD;
it in spite of her.; and it lived to bless her care. But&#xD;
this is rambling.&#xD;

The great divine had not acquired any offspring,Â° but&#xD;
that made not the slightest difference. Ie did not con-&#xD;
sider experience of any value, and hesitated not at all to'&#xD;
instruct parents of large families upon the trailing of&#xD;
their olive-branches, and the upshot of his teaching was a&#xD;
big, bunch of stout rods' over the chimney-piece, replen-&#xD;
ished as often as used up, well punctuated with hard&#xD;
words and soaked in bread and water.&#xD;
Next in order was a discourse on behavior in church:&#xD;
".Let all things be done decently and in order," so put as&#xD;
to be rather sure of giving offence, and kindling whatever&#xD;
spirit of opposition there might be in the human heart ;&#xD;
and the doctor carried his exercise of clerical authority to&#xD;
the length of rebuking and pointing out anything which'&#xD;
did not happen to meet his views in his congregation, not&#xD;
sparing gray-headed sleepers who snored under his six-&#xD;
teenthlys, nor little children who rustled and squirmed&#xD;
while he thundered out his resounding periods.&#xD;
Also a great sermon on amusements: Dancing was a&#xD;
device of Satan, cards were named "Devil's leaves,"&#xD;
backgammon a wicked casting of lots. In fact he bun-&#xD;
dled all sorts of recreations together into a wrapper of&#xD;
hell fire, leaving little to do on the earth (so ,thought his&#xD;
young people) except to work, hear Dr. Hardbake preach,&#xD;
look pious and pay their dues; insomuch, that the word&#xD;
looked like a dreary prison, where Dr. Hardbake was&#xD;
self-appointed jailer. Last but not least, was his scourger&#xD;
on temperance, which, I am sorry to say, lost, little of&#xD;
its value to such of his hearers as happened o inhale a&#xD;
whiff of his breath after dinner.&#xD;
But all this while we have irreverently left the great&#xD;
man standing on the platform of the car, instead of es-&#xD;
corting him home genteelly.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Goodlove's pretty residence, bay-windowed, many&#xD;
piazzaed, had been created into a perpetual parsonage.&#xD;
The trustees thought, as he had got to leave it, they might&#xD;
probably secure it for about a third of its value; and very&#xD;
likely they would have done so, but for Mr. Amaranth&#xD;
Blossom, Augusta's father, who, having been a school-&#xD;
friend of Goodlove's---as he expressed it,"snivelled over the&#xD;
same spelling-book,"-and much interested in bringing him&#xD;
to the parish, he watched the little game of the sharp&#xD;
trustees, and just shoved aside the minister, and entered&#xD;
into the bargaining with gusto, standing out, haggling,&#xD;
and making terms.&#xD;
" Why, gentlemen!" said he, stepping out on the great&#xD;
piazza and looking off over Pleasant Valley, and waving&#xD;
his hand at the flower-garden's winding walks, and the&#xD;
tiny brooklet at the bottom. "Why ! gentlemen,_ those&#xD;
oak-trees are worth a thousand dollars apiece; =and there&#xD;
are thirteen varieties 'of grapes in full bearing besides the&#xD;
peach and apple orchards ! I don't know where Goodlove&#xD;
ever got the time to do Paul's work and Apollo's also, be-&#xD;
sides his own; but he was always a tough chap; I notice&#xD;
these fine-blooded fellows often are. i hope you see what&#xD;
we are to get to make up for the-teaching he gave us in&#xD;
God's best works and delicate living; but I suppose you&#xD;
will be satisfied; if your new man dips his sermons in fire&#xD;
and brimstone every Sunday, I suppose you will relish&#xD;
the rations. I expect to get as fat as a match on the diet&#xD;
myself  Y&#xD;
Aftei the deeds were conveyed Mr. Blossom stood&#xD;
shoulder to shoulder with his friend once more, to hinder&#xD;
his investing his money in the. Sprightly Mining Company,&#xD;

time ; and Mr. Blossom did not rest satisfied, till he got'&#xD;
the pay4ent safely invested in a \good paying "National&#xD;
Screw;" which always gave fair dividends.&#xD;
H4Irs. Hardbake went over the parsonage from garret to&#xD;
cellar before she took off her bonnet, made remarks upon&#xD;
all the furniture, which was a free gift, gathered and,&#xD;
placed by the Baiquither ladies from the parish, found fault&#xD;
with the former incumbent's housekeeping, pointing to&#xD;
some pencil scratches on the wall of a chamber, evidently&#xD;
used as a play-room, where childish hands had been busy&#xD;
ornamenting to their idea, defacing in the view of their&#xD;
elders ; and she also picked up and consigned to the kit-&#xD;
chen stove some old toys, which little Timothy Goodlove&#xD;
had outgrown and left behind, and the ladies, being also&#xD;
mothers, had spared for the benefit of the possible small&#xD;
:;  ..I1   bakes.&#xD;
H Iflay rooms," said she, "have no business in a Christ-&#xD;
an house, and toys are a wicked waste of money and&#xD;
time. Children do not come into this sinful world to play,&#xD;
but to get purified and made fit for heaven, and taught&#xD;
how to escape damnation!"&#xD;
Mrs. lardbake was a little, dark, wiry woman ; like&#xD;
her lord, terribly learned. Indeed, I'm told that they&#xD;
did their courting in Greek, and kissed in foreign tongues.&#xD;
She was a teacher before she made the doctor happy, and&#xD;
they had not been long settled in Cherry Brook, when&#xD;
there came rumors that she had been reprimanded by the&#xD;
school committee for undue flagellations and unheard of .&#xD;
kinds of punishments, such as obliging her pupils to stand&#xD;
on one toe for half a day, grinding the flesh off tender&#xD;
fingers by twirling a lead pencil between them  while&#xD;
crushed in her strong. grip, and other ingenious devices,&#xD;
which did honor to her head and her heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
She struggled to carry the parish on her shoulders.&#xD;
Any ambitious female who thirsted for prominence in&#xD;
-charity associations or sewing circles, found herself in the&#xD;
lot of the wicked, for verily her hopes were cut off, the&#xD;
sub-reverend madam concentrating all dignities in her&#xD;
single self.&#xD;
Mrs. Ilardbake had a child in her household, the off-&#xD;
spring of a foreign missionary left to be educated ; one&#xD;
of the poor little waifs, whom our laborers in foreign fields&#xD;
are -so fond of dropping about -among the stay-at-homes,&#xD;
very much as the ostrich lays her eggs in the sand, and&#xD;
runs off, leaving them to be hatched or not, as they may.&#xD;
If God in his providence bestows children upon missiofla-&#xD;
ries, it rather looks as if he meant the missionaries should&#xD;
take care of them, donlt it ? Mother duties in4Beyroot&#xD;
are very much the same as mother duties in Cherry Brook,&#xD;
only a little more so. But Mrs. Broadcast thought other-&#xD;
wise, and she-cast her helpless baby into the Christian lap&#xD;
of Mrs. Dr. Ilardbake and a compliment with it.&#xD;
"I feel quite easy in leaving my dear Christina, though&#xD;
she is but seven weeks old. Your system is so excellent.&#xD;
You see I have carefully read the doctor's practical tract&#xD;
on 'Bring up lambs for the true fold,' as well as your&#xD;
own 'hints to Mothers.' I know she will be strictly&#xD;
trained, and prepared to come out into the field in due&#xD;
time and labor in the vineyard, and I beg of you to im-&#xD;
press her infant mind with the weight of her coming re-&#xD;
sponsibility, and her mother's self-denial."- And away&#xD;
she posted to look over a fresh box of good things made up&#xD;
by the Dorcas for her personal comfort, and to write&#xD;
tracts and teach school for the 43eyrooters. So eager was&#xD;
the, discussing plans for their comfort and salvation, that&#xD;
even during her stay at the parsonage she was quite deaf&#xD;

to the piteous wailing of the mite of flesh of her flesh&#xD;
and bone of her bone, which ought to have drawn tears&#xD;
from a savage heart. Can a mother forget her sucking&#xD;
child ? Yea, verily, when it is a trouble and a hindrance&#xD;
to missionary labor in a foreign field.&#xD;
Little Christina had managed to get on somehow, and&#xD;
was five years old when the Reverend Hardbake assumed&#xD;
the pastorate of what was irreverently named the stub-&#xD;
tailed church in. Cherry Brook, a stone edifice whose&#xD;
steeple had never mounted above its roof, being tempora-&#xD;
rily finished by boards and patching, waiting for a gush&#xD;
of liberality among the members, which was slow in com-&#xD;
ng.&#xD;
She was kept in a high-chair several hours. of each day,&#xD;
studying lessons, and Mrs. Hardbake instructed her maid-&#xD;
of-all-work to say to visitors: "I cannot be seen at this&#xD;
time; 1 am superintending my ward's education."  The&#xD;
child committed on an average fifty or sixty verses of the&#xD;
New Testament, and could reel off the Westminster Cat-&#xD;
echism as glibly. as laughing Daisy Blossom could her.&#xD;
Mother Goose. She showed little'desire for childish&#xD;
sports or armusements, in fact, she never played ; when&#xD;
released from the educating process, she sat in a little&#xD;
chair, perfectly quiet. To be spre, her eyes were unnatu-&#xD;
rally large and hollow, and hei head over-sized, but she&#xD;
gave utterance to remarkable sentiments and wishes, had&#xD;
already said many times, she should like to die and be laid&#xD;
up in the church-yard where the birds would come and&#xD;
sing above her grave; and on being corrected and told,&#xD;
that she meant " go to heaven and be an angel," accepted&#xD;
patiently the amendment and said, "yes, she did."  She&#xD;
looked as if she might be -indulged. before long, some&#xD;
days, when she had failed in her lessons and got only&#xD;
&#xD;
bread and water for dinner. She sang plaintive hymns in&#xD;
a weak, piping voice; sang them, standing at Mrs. Hard-&#xD;
bake's knee, for company, who praised her very much in&#xD;
the lady's hearing, and when they got outside it, declared,&#xD;
it was a shame that poor thing was .kept so close and&#xD;
treated so hard, and their hearts ached for her! So they&#xD;
did!&#xD;
Mrs. Hlardbake always carried a note-book and pencil&#xD;
in her pocket, jotting down all Christina's pious sayings.&#xD;
She intended to enrich the Sunday-school literature.in&#xD;
due time with a book entitled "Memoirs of a Little Christ-&#xD;
ian," and at one time she had the prospect of adding,&#xD;
"who died at the early age of five years," but unfortia&#xD;
nately the child got up from a low nervous fever she had,&#xD;
and insisted on living, so that addendum  had- to be&#xD;
stricken out. She had ,been presented a candidate for&#xD;
admission to the church the spring before they left their&#xD;
old parish, but refused on account of her extreme infancy.&#xD;
Mrs. Hardbake persisted: "This child has had a won-&#xD;
derful experience! she was born a Christian."&#xD;
"Not according to our creed," replied the session (total&#xD;
depravity and the rest, see catechism). Mrs. Hlardbake&#xD;
tried argument, sweet cajolings, subreverend authority, in&#xD;
vain, the elders were full of irony, but they were also hard&#xD;
like iron. The doctor himself, ponderous, heavy weight&#xD;
as he was, could not shove them a peg, and the lady was&#xD;
obliged to erase the following entry which she had rather&#xD;
prematurely made in her journal, her private journal&#xD;
which she intended for publication:&#xD;
"This remarkable child was cordially received into the&#xD;
bosom of our dear church at the early age of four years,&#xD;
and there were few dry eyes at the sweet and impressive&#xD;
ceremony. Dr. Hardbake delivered his thrilling dis-&#xD;

course from the text: "Out of the mouths of babes and&#xD;
sucklings hast thou perfected praise," and her clear re-&#xD;
plies to the questions of the officers were a marvel to all&#xD;
who heard them. I dedicated her to God when she was&#xD;
seven weeks old, and am not surprised at the result of my&#xD;
teaching. I look forward to her perfect sanctification&#xD;
ere long; I am praying daily for it." She read the ser-&#xD;
mon-compliment to her husband (cunning creature), and&#xD;
she thereby secured his influence in the matter ; which,&#xD;
it is true, she had to "figure' a little upon sometimes.&#xD;
One of the leading reasons in Mrs. Hardbake's mind&#xD;
for desiring a new field, was her determination to intro-&#xD;
duce her prodigy into the fold before she was five, nolens&#xD;
volens, and she set to work about it as soon as she arrived&#xD;
in Cherry Brook. Very few arrangements suited Dr.&#xD;
Hardbake in his new place, and he projected reforms&#xD;
with a high hand.&#xD;
The children whom Mr. Goodlove had been accustomed to&#xD;
gather into his study each week for a loving talk, spiritual&#xD;
leading and cheerful hymn-singing, must be catechised&#xD;
every Saturday afternoon. If he could have heard "the&#xD;
curses not loud but deep," launched at him by youth thus&#xD;
cut out of their half-holiday, he would have looked&#xD;
glummer than he did, if possible ; and the side glances they&#xD;
shot at him as they stood up before his severe spectacles,&#xD;
were not amiable. He also changed the time.for prepara-&#xD;
tory lecture, "Triday afternoon, three o'clock." The&#xD;
sober old horses had jogged under the long shed ever&#xD;
since they had been horses, and the farmers and their&#xD;
wives been called to worship bythe bell of the Methodist.&#xD;
"love feast," the stub-tail never having elongated into&#xD;
tower enough to hold a bell yet.&#xD;
Sucli gatherings as they had there during the Goodlove&#xD;
&#xD;
vicarate, will never be forgotten' by the participants, so&#xD;
comforting, so restful, such helps to holy living. But now&#xD;
it was Friday evening, a time inconvenient and disagree-&#xD;
able; when hard-working folks were tired and sleepy,&#xD;
and the dark nights and storms made such cogent reasons&#xD;
for staying away; that the attendance was thin, drowsy,&#xD;
and uninterested in the dry service, only a couple of verses&#xD;
of a hymn at most, and a long sermon full of hard words&#xD;
and knotty doctrine.&#xD;
He managed also to' spoil the singing on Sunday, frown-&#xD;
ing upon the opening anthems the young singers de-&#xD;
lighted in, insisting on old tunes, "Dundee, Rochester,&#xD;
Maar," and the like, into which he droned with his rough&#xD;
bass, like a wheezy old bag-pipe.&#xD;
The greatest innovation was a Bible class of the -whole&#xD;
congregation on Sunday afternoons, instead of the usual&#xD;
sermon, in which he questioned his parishioners on abstruse&#xD;
points of doctrine, calculated to show off his learning and&#xD;
brow-beat the catechised in the presence of their peers.&#xD;
"Brother Crowfoot, which system do we embrace the.&#xD;
superlapsarian or the sublapsarian?$" asked he during&#xD;
the first exercise, taking off his glasses and jerking them&#xD;
at the brother, while he paused for a reply, and the others&#xD;
looked curiously at the two.&#xD;
"I dunno reely," answered 'the puzzled farmer, while&#xD;
he rubbed his hands together, and cast about him a sickly&#xD;
smile. Augusta Blossom  also smiled audibly.  In a&#xD;
twinkling the divine's reproving finger was pointed at&#xD;
her, and his big voice called'out:&#xD;
"No laughing, young woman !" Then he got up, shock-&#xD;
ingly red in the face, while he thundered forth a long and&#xD;
very personal exhortation to the maiden, during which&#xD;
Mrs. Blossom arose and left the meeting, followed by her&#xD;

&#xD;
entire family; and ill-disposed people got up a report;&#xD;
that Augusta kissed her hand to the minister in the door-"&#xD;
way. It was not true, she said afterwards; she wished&#xD;
she had, and also gave it as her opinion, that although he&#xD;
was obviously too old to have his hair pulled, his bald&#xD;
crown showing the whiteness of an egg, he never would&#xD;
betoo old to have his ears boxed, and she should like to&#xD;
have the ceremony well performed; and old Miss Pet-&#xD;
ingill immediately set afloat several versions of her re-&#xD;
marks.&#xD;
Now the Blossoms were people of means-; liberal sup-&#xD;
porters of the church, full of generosity and gifts, and&#xD;
the deacons insisted that Dr. Hardbake must set things&#xD;
right with them; and they prevailed, because they used&#xD;
touching arguments, which proved that his larder would&#xD;
surely lack poultry at Thanksgiving time, and his-cellar&#xD;
be scanty in earthfruits, unless the breach was healed ;&#xD;
and a couple of them accompanied him on a 'pastoral&#xD;
visit to the household to that end.&#xD;
Mrs. Blossom was distantly polite, and after "the por-&#xD;
tion of scripture and prayer," which was the minister's&#xD;
idea of such an inroad, she said very mildly, but in quite&#xD;
a positive, distinct voice:&#xD;
" You may as well understand first as last, Dr. Hard-&#xD;
bake, that you have not got a Scotch peasantry to deal&#xD;
with, and if you expect such men as Mr. Blossom to help'&#xD;
run the church, you will be wise to behave in as gen-&#xD;
tiemanly a manner as possible. He rates men by their&#xD;
conduct, not by their profession."&#xD;
This was a very long speech for the quiet, friendly lady&#xD;
to make, and though it .sounded plain and menacing in&#xD;
the doctor's ears, it was the truth and good advice to boot.&#xD;
But the learned divine glanced from under his shaggy&#xD;
&#xD;
eyebrows, and dropped his loose underlip, while he&#xD;
looked{ at her, and he departed very wroth, anal he had&#xD;
no godd words for the family forever after. We must&#xD;
do hii the justice to say, that he preferred his indigna-&#xD;
tion t turkeys and chickens, and ran the risk of losing&#xD;
creature comforts, rather than "knuckle down."  He&#xD;
never afterwards spoke of Mrs. Blossom as a "decent&#xD;
body," which was the encomium he generally passed on&#xD;
such ladies of his parish as he approved. Old Miss Petin-&#xD;
gill said : "Miss Blossom certingly did smile a contempt-&#xD;
ible smile, and she hoped the reproof would have a salu.&#xD;
tary effect." The bluff, comfortable farmer, "ruddy, fat,&#xD;
and fair," who wore a shad-bellied coat, and a fob chain&#xD;
as wide as your two fingers of guinea gold; with a come-&#xD;
lian seal set in bear's claws, and a shirt double-ruffled,&#xD;
. whenever he donned his best, who paid his hands every&#xD;
Saturday, fed them good juicy meat, and never knocked&#xD;
off their tea and sugar or preserves, like some of his&#xD;
neighbors; whose heart was as warm as his purse was&#xD;
heavy, who liked his friends with all his might, and hated&#xD;
his enemies, was not a nice parishioner to get at odds&#xD;
with. He had never been reconciled to the loss of his&#xD;
schoolmate, Goodlove, and took no especial pains to&#xD;
make things easy for his successor at best; but after the&#xD;
public assault on his daughter, he would no more of the&#xD;
parson; projecting at him his characteristicremarks on&#xD;
any occasion when they came in contact, and his wife&#xD;
had hard work to induce her Amaranth to attend any fur&#xD;
there upon his ministrations.&#xD;
" I don't take stock in the new dominie,my dear,"&#xD;
said he. "I hate to see him come stalking into meeting&#xD;
with a Bible under his arm, as big as a mile-stone, and if&#xD;
a dog sneezes, he wants to have him arrested; and he'll&#xD;

fire off a lot of questions at a man, that the dickens,&#xD;
couldn't answerj;n words as long as my arm; and  u&#xD;
see him down the village buying anything, and you'll she&#xD;
a chap that is as sharp as a worldling at a trade. He&#xD;
lost the sale of- his gray mare last Friday, because he&#xD;
wouldn't let Dan Burke have the halter to lead her home&#xD;
by into the bargain. Dan said the stingy parson might&#xD;
keep his old dapple till doomsday, and he don't think so&#xD;
well of church folks since, neither. No Violet, my dear;&#xD;
you are a duck of a woman, and I am very fond of&#xD;
you, and I'll buy you a silk dress every week of the year,'&#xD;
if you say so; and Gussy.is a good girl; I am proud of&#xD;
of Gussy; she plays that organ like a nightingale. I&#xD;
don't grudge the five hundred I put into it a mite, and&#xD;
I'll harness up -the bays, and drive you down to meetin'&#xD;
in style with all the pleasure in life; but don't ask me to&#xD;
sit and hear that blusterin' critter show off his learning.&#xD;
Doth not the wild ass bray when he hath grass?   Of&#xD;
course he does; so does the parson when he gets into the&#xD;
pulpit! I can't stand him! I'll tell you what I will do,&#xD;
from the word 'go': -I'll drive you to Peaceful Valley,&#xD;
and stop there over Sunday at the tavern, just to hear the&#xD;
sound of Steadfast Goodlove's voice. I'd give ten dollars&#xD;
this minute to hear, him pray. Don't look solemn, Violet-;&#xD;
you know lardbake's sermons are as bare of interest as&#xD;
a pig's tail of feathers he don't know when to talk and&#xD;
when to hold his tongue. Why the other day I happened&#xD;
to say 'damn,' and the prig pulled a long face and un-&#xD;
dertook to tell me my business, as if I didn't know what&#xD;
I'd a right to say as well as he did. ' All right, doctor,',&#xD;
says I; 'you preach, and I swear, and we don't either&#xD;
of us mean any harm by it, do we? only I must say, I&#xD;
feel a little more modest than you seem to, telling the&#xD;
&#xD;
Lord what he knows and what he don't know; every Sun-&#xD;
day.'  He'd best leave me alone, Violet, my dear,&#xD;
hadn't he? I've had the laugh all on my side so far."&#xD;
It was not long -after his arrival that the minister came&#xD;
into open collision with Mr. Blossom in the blacksmith's&#xD;
shop, where, while the farmer was waiting for a portion&#xD;
of stock calomel, the parson walked-in, cane in hand.&#xD;
"Where's Burke?" asked he pompously of the journey-&#xD;
man. " Tell him I want my horse attended to imme li-&#xD;
ately."&#xD;
"lie's gone out, sir, to take of widow Dodd's funeral.&#xD;
I'll wait on you, sir."&#xD;
" No you won't; I choose to have the master serve me,&#xD;
not the bungling apprentice. Why don't the fellow stay&#xD;
where he belongs, and mind his business?$"&#xD;
" It is a part of his business to see his neighbors de-&#xD;
cently buried, he thinks," answered the young man, color-&#xD;
ing up through his grime and smut.&#xD;
"No impertinence, boy! remember you are addressing&#xD;
the minister ; I tell you his place is here. I shall re-&#xD;
move my patronage, if he does not take more pains."&#xD;
Mr. Blossom leaned against the ox-frame, whittling, a&#xD;
favorite occupation of his leisure; he always carried a&#xD;
very sharp knife and a supply of pine-sticks. His friends&#xD;
often watched him with interest ; they thought he was&#xD;
about to make something, but he never did. He smiled&#xD;
while the divine was holding forth, and sliced off his&#xD;
neat yellow shavings very carefully during the colloquy.&#xD;
"The fact is, Dr. Iardbake," said he, brushing off a&#xD;
couple of splinters from his sleeve, "the fact 'is, widow&#xD;
Dodd had no business to die, much less get to her bury-&#xD;
ing, till you'd had your horse shod."&#xD;
The by-standers laughed, and the young journeyman&#xD;

&#xD;
pushed off his paper cap, showing his white forehead and&#xD;
black curls, and also his regular teeth in a hearty laugh,&#xD;
and he smote his anvil with sounding applause.  The&#xD;
parson tried to frown down the jolly farmer, who didn't&#xD;
care a button for his airs, being like the unfrocked rector,&#xD;
Who "did not degrade worth a cent," but preached harder&#xD;
than ever under the ban of his bishop. Mr. Blossom looked&#xD;
extremely pleasant under Dr. Hardbake's displeasure.&#xD;
" By the way, doctor, is it true that 'Satan trembles&#xD;
when he sees the weakest saint upon his knees'" as the&#xD;
doctor dropped his underlie and glared, making no an-&#xD;
swer, the farmer added: "because if it is, I was going to&#xD;
say, I suppose you give him the shakes once in a while,&#xD;
like the very mischief."&#xD;
The doctor looked, as Mr. Blossom told his wife after-&#xD;
ward, "as mad as a wet hen;" hut having no witty re-&#xD;
joinder ready, and carnal weapons being out of his line,&#xD;
he walked to the door and tamped his cane impatiently&#xD;
among the cinders, leaving a grinning circle behind him&#xD;
who much enjoyed his discomfiture.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
"COME UP INTO THE CHARIOT .OF LOVE.&#xD;
11O MEllOW Mrs. Hardbake was not popular in&#xD;
i Cherry Brook, for all her activity and good works,&#xD;
and she had much trouble to gain any ascendency&#xD;
over the outspoken women, who knew quite as well how&#xD;
to fill missionary boxes, get up oyster suppers, clean the&#xD;
church and such like, as they needed to, and did not take&#xD;
kindly to any word of command from her. The female&#xD;
prayer-meeting, at which she did all the talking and most&#xD;
of the praying, soon got so reduced in numbers, that she&#xD;
was obliged to do it,- if it was done; and her say 'so,&#xD;
went only for the ipse dixit of one woman among many,&#xD;
and a small woman at that; a state of affairs which wad&#xD;
by no means agreeable to her. They ridiculed her set&#xD;
phrases, made fun of her patronage, and did as they&#xD;
pleased in spite of her.&#xD;
The Balquither ladies invited her to their house using&#xD;
all hospitality, and on the whole, were rather iore for&#xD;
than against her on principle; but Mrs. Crowfoot. posi&#xD;
tively refused to send around the three loaves, of calce,&#xD;
and card of buns she was asked to bake one Saturday,&#xD;
saying, she coal see no reason why Mrs. Hardbake was&#xD;
not as well able to heat herself over the kitchen stoye as&#xD;

she was. So you see, the life of the parson's wife was&#xD;
not a bed of roses, for all her thorough orthodoxy. In-&#xD;
deed Mrs. Goodlove had a better time, and was told by&#xD;
Mrs. Plunket, who was instructed to find out what she&#xD;
needed most one Christmas: "We find, Mrs. Goodbye,&#xD;
that we must treat you as we do other people; you are&#xD;
not a bit minister's folksy."&#xD;
Orchis thought attentively over Miss Margery's advice&#xD;
and finally resolved to act upon it, desiring to followthe&#xD;
lead of some responsible person, living in the world. She&#xD;
had an inborn leading to ghostly counsel, fostered at her&#xD;
pious mother's knee in her sweet infancy, which no after-&#xD;
life could subdue or obliterate. And it seemed as if in&#xD;
taking this step she might find a clue to her future way,&#xD;
which she was willing to seize and follow. But she&#xD;
dreaded the minister's wife; she had been sat upon,&#xD;
"warned to flee from the wrath to come, leave the beg-&#xD;
garly elements of the world," at the paring-bee, besides&#xD;
being unpleasantly looked over; and thoughrske did not&#xD;
y to herself the good lady's right to behave so, she&#xD;
J= other hoped she should not get any more of it; and&#xD;
eed thebig-headed, big-necked minister was- suffi-&#xD;
Sformidable.&#xD;
s she was walking slowly along the road, turning over&#xD;
a  her mind what she had to say and the qjiekest and&#xD;
easiest way in which to say it, she was overtaken by Au-&#xD;
giista Blossom in a little basket-phaeton, in which she&#xD;
was fond of driving about the quiet country roads. No&#xD;
sooner did Augusta espy the pilgrim, than she made haste&#xD;
to lift her small sister Daisy upon her lap, pull in her&#xD;
pony, and call out in a voice, friendly, and hearty as her&#xD;
father's:-.&#xD;
&#xD;
"CQfE UP INTO THE CH ARIQT OF LOVE." -181&#xD;
"Come up into the chariot of love, Orchis, and I'll give&#xD;
you an idea how Zilpah can step out."&#xD;
"Thank you," replied Orchis, but I am going to see&#xD;
the minister."&#xD;
"Well, what of that I'll carry you to his house; I'd&#xD;
as soon look about there a little as not, and I'll help you&#xD;
make your call.  June Rose told me, the madam sent&#xD;
that poor little missionary-weed she's got up-stairs, and&#xD;
gave her no breakfast, because she came down one morn-&#xD;
ing without the beau-catchers pasted on her flat cheeks;&#xD;
they say she makes her wear them, just because she found,&#xD;
out she hated the sight of them; she says it mortifies the&#xD;
flesh."&#xD;
"Turns it black ?" exclaimed Orchis aghast. "I should&#xD;
scarcely think it possible, because if it is, it will kill the&#xD;
.child."&#xD;
"I should not. in the least wonder if it did, after a&#xD;
while," replied Augusta, giving a minute's quizzical study&#xD;
to Orchis' sober countenance. 'Come on, dear; I'll go&#xD;
with you, just to show them Im not afraid of them, if old&#xD;
'Blowhard'-(that is what papa calls him), did call me&#xD;
out in church."&#xD;
"But I intend to talk alone with the minister."&#xD;
" Oh, you are a candidate to unite! Well, I won't hin-&#xD;
der you talking alone with him, I'm sure. I'd rather it&#xD;
was you than me."&#xD;
"Idon't think I understand you, Augusta; I wish to ask&#xD;
him for advice. Miss Margery McWhirter told me he&#xD;
was the proper person to go to."&#xD;
"Miss Margery ! of course, ae's hand-in-glove with all&#xD;
the minister's folks. I'd as so6 go and knock ny head&#xD;
against a stone wall, and ask for lollipops, but each one&#xD;
to his liking. I insist on your getting in with me; Ivam&#xD;

more than curious to hear how you will thrive. You see,&#xD;
got Daisy all sprigged in her best, and I'll make her&#xD;
p6int- a moral for the Beyrooter, who goes dressed like&#xD;
time in the primer. How queer it seems, the idea of&#xD;
going from home for counsel; I always pour everything&#xD;
into papa's ears," Augusta added, after Orchis was seated&#xD;
and she had driven a while in-a brown study.&#xD;
"I have no father," replied Orchis in a low voice,&#xD;
turning aside her face and watching the swift wheel's&#xD;
motion..&#xD;
"Plant my head for cabbage sprouts ! " said Augusta,&#xD;
unconsciously borrowing one of her father's exclamations,&#xD;
in her vexation with herself. " What a blunderer I am !&#xD;
I knew you had no parents, and yet I couldn't have the&#xD;
sense to hold my tongue; but as you are going to be my&#xD;
dear friend, you must get used to me."&#xD;
" Thank you; when I make up my mind that I may&#xD;
have friends, I shall like you very much," replied Orchis&#xD;
quietly.&#xD;
"Take plenty of time to consider before you decide,&#xD;
please," replied Augusta half vexed. "Candace was not&#xD;
so slow about it: we vowed eternal friendship, the other&#xD;
evening, before we had met fifteen minutes."&#xD;
"My sister can make friends easily I think," said Orchis.&#xD;
She did not speak directly again; as she was thinking how&#xD;
one evening among people, had given her pet a foothold&#xD;
and position, in spite of the past; and wondering why she,&#xD;
Orchis, could not go forth as unconscious of it, and as&#xD;
light-hearted as her merry sister ; and a thought of Prec-&#xD;
ious Plunket mixed itself up with the rest, so that she&#xD;
was still recalling his looks and words, when they reached&#xD;
the parsonage.&#xD;
" Well, here we are at the gate of Castle Dangerous,n&#xD;
&#xD;
" COME UP INTO THE     HARIOT OF LO&#xD;
said Augusta, pulling in Zilpah. "Hadn't we  er&#xD;
a bit and say our prayers, before we enterind&#xD;
"No," replied Orchis,."I only say mine morn&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
" Well, you are a funny girl I" said Augusta, laughing&#xD;
at her matter-of-fact face. "You don't joke much,'do.&#xD;
you. "&#xD;
"No, Candace does; I believe I do not know how;&#xD;
perhaps I can learn after a while, when I hear you do&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Is that a hitI I believe you are an artful dodger, after&#xD;
all your sober ways; but come on, since you decline to&#xD;
take to your bended -knees, I shall proceed to use my ben-&#xD;
ded knuckles. I see dear Mr. Goodlove's knocker is off&#xD;
the door; I am glad of that."&#xD;
When they were ushered into the sitting-room, Chris-&#xD;
tina had been released from her high chair and lesson,&#xD;
and transferred to a corner, where she was to stand one&#xD;
hour, for looking off her book. She scanned the other&#xD;
child in her fresh robes and rosy beauty, but she had no&#xD;
smiles for her; she was pale, resigned, tearless, and she&#xD;
stooped forward wearily ; she was nearing the end of her&#xD;
time of punishment, when they arrived.&#xD;
"Poor child! she is fit to 4rop! What do you suppose&#xD;
she is perched up there for?" whispered Augusta.indig-&#xD;
nantly. "How do you do, Christina? I've brought Daisy&#xD;
to see you."&#xD;
"Speak very pleasantly to the little girl," commanded&#xD;
Mrs. llardbake, who entered the room just in time to hear&#xD;
the last remark. "You may sit down now."&#xD;
" And not .one minute too soon either," thought Au-&#xD;
gusta, eyeing the lady over. " I'll see, if I can't stir up&#xD;
the child, to look as' if the breath of life hadn't al left her."&#xD;

"Ddisy is going to the circus to-morrow, Christina; won't&#xD;
you come too, and see the pretty horses, and the ladies in&#xD;
spangles, and the ponies, and hear the nice music? if&#xD;
you like it, I'll take you, and buy you a lot of peanuts&#xD;
into the bargain."&#xD;
Mrs. Ilardbake fairly gasped. "Tell her what you are&#xD;
taught in this pious atmosphere about such sinful amuse-&#xD;
ments, Christina," said she in a severe tone,'calculated to&#xD;
strike awe to the hearts of all present.&#xD;
"I wouldn't go to a circus for anything," piped up the&#xD;
child in a wee voice. "They are wicked ; only sinners&#xD;
go to them. I'm going to make a purfession, and join&#xD;
the church."&#xD;
"Tell them what you love to do with your pennies,&#xD;
Christina."&#xD;
"I love to put them in the contrarry-bution box, to&#xD;
buy Bibles for the heathings, that bow down to wooden&#xD;
stone, so that they can all join the church and be good&#xD;
like me."&#xD;
Mrs. Elardbake rolled up her eyes and whipped. her&#xD;
note-book out of her pocket, into which she jotted down&#xD;
the pious reply.&#xD;
While she was thus occupied, little Miss Laisy climbed&#xD;
on the chintz lounge, and began running back and forth&#xD;
between the two girls, falling on their necks and kissing&#xD;
them at each return. As soon as the hostess discovered&#xD;
her sportiveness, she quite unceremoniously rose, and&#xD;
taking her by the arm, lifted her to the floor.&#xD;
"I don't allow children to run on my sofa with their&#xD;
feet," said she. Christina had been attracted by the&#xD;
mirthful child, and following closely the motions of her,&#xD;
laughing. face, she had very nearly smiled-in sympathy ;&#xD;
but she left off quickly and looked frightened and wor.-&#xD;
&#xD;
"COMfE UP INTO THE CHARIOT OF LGVE" 191&#xD;
ried instead, as if she knew what it meant to be taken&#xD;
hold of with a vengeance.&#xD;
Poor Daisy, tenderly reared and much petted, gazed&#xD;
an instant at the hard, dark, almost cruel face, shrinking as&#xD;
far as possible from its beady eyes, while her little dim-&#xD;
pled hand impulsively felt the place on her round soft&#xD;
arm, which had been clutched by the wiry fingers; and&#xD;
then burying herself in Augusta's lap, began to sob&#xD;
miss Blossom rose instantly. "Don't cry, baby I" said&#xD;
she; "we will go where there are handsome sofas, and not.&#xD;
too good for your blue slippers either, any day of the&#xD;
week. I shall wait for you in my phaeton, Orchis, and I&#xD;
must say,:I wish you well out of this house!"&#xD;
" My dear, you do not seem to understand ; you must&#xD;
learn to receive my reproofs in a less contumacious spirit.&#xD;
I am set over you to direct and instruct you, a mother&#xD;
in Israel. I shall see your parents, and insist that you&#xD;
behave more meekly and respectfully in my presence."&#xD;
" I'll look out sharp, ma'am, how I get into it again very&#xD;
soon. Your husband in church, and you at home, are&#xD;
enough for the present. I shall be careful how you get&#xD;
another fling at me. One mother will answer to manage&#xD;
me, thank you; you can't stand me in a corner, nor Daisy&#xD;
either, thank fortune ! Good-by, poor Christina; I am as&#xD;
sorry for you as I ever was for anybody in my whole&#xD;
life, so I ai! "&#xD;
Augusta had not fairly reached the door, when she ran&#xD;
against young Mrs. Prescott, whose husband left her, and&#xD;
whose heart got so heavy sometimes, that she wanted help&#xD;
to carry her sorrows ; and she was come for a call upon&#xD;
her minister's family, hoping for a taste of comfort from&#xD;
their abundance.&#xD;

"Oh, good-morning, little dear," said Mrs. llardbake,&#xD;
stooping to patronize the little one; "is this Judge Belli-&#xD;
ger's child?"&#xD;
"No ma'am, it's my child," replied the small lady.&#xD;
"Oh, I beg pardon ! Mrs. Prescott ; I really did not&#xD;
know you in that white sun-bonnet ; I took you for'-the&#xD;
little one's nurse."&#xD;
"'So I am, his faithful nurse, and he is my best com-&#xD;

"Yes, of course ! You have gotten a man-child from&#xD;
the Lord, and like Hannah of old you must dedicate him&#xD;
to His work. Family all well ? "&#xD;
"This is my family;. you see he is well."&#xD;
"Christina, replace your right water-curl immediately;&#xD;
you, have carelessly permitted it to drop. I am very ex-&#xD;
act in my training of the dear treasure in what are called&#xD;
'trifles.' Open your book, and, commit three verses of&#xD;
the sixth hymn-' There is a fiery, dreadful hell,'-as a&#xD;
penalty for your heedlessness. I have had a visit from&#xD;
an ill-bred, saucy girl, plainly unregenerate and belong-&#xD;
ing to the evil one. Of a truth, there are few women fit&#xD;
for the awful responsibility of rearing immortal children&#xD;
for the next world. I intend giving a course of lectures&#xD;
to mothers, as soon as I can weave them in with my other&#xD;
heavy duties. Christina,! if you cannot keep awake, get&#xD;
up and stand till you have finished your task. Instant&#xD;
obedience, you see, is my method. You and your husband&#xD;
have presented .your son in baptism, I presume, Mrs.&#xD;
Prescott ?"&#xD;
"No, I -am alone with my child," and the little lady's&#xD;
voice trembled.&#xD;
"Ah yes; I remember; he has left you. Well, in such&#xD;
cases, I think there is generally apt to be blame on both&#xD;

sides. It is the duty of the wife to try and reclaim the&#xD;
wandering spouse, and stay up his hands during the labors&#xD;
and trials of- the masculine life."&#xD;
Mrs. Prescott rose with a heavy sigh. Her unworthy&#xD;
husband had broken every command in the decalogue; he&#xD;
was accustomed to come home from his filthy. orgies,&#xD;
smash her furniture, beat her boy, and ill-use herself.&#xD;
She knew better than Mrs. llardbake, what kind of stay&#xD;
his hands needed to keep him human, and she gave up&#xD;
whatever idea she might have entertained, of telling her&#xD;
griefs, or seeking help, and took .leave with a longing&#xD;
after the Steadfast Goodlove, and his sympathetic wife,&#xD;
who always knew just what balm she lacked,.and how to&#xD;
lead her over the hard places.&#xD;
It was with rather a forbidding countenance, that Mrs.&#xD;
Hardbake turned to Orchis, who had sat through these&#xD;
calls in concentrated quiet; Augusta's pert independence&#xD;
rankled in her breast, and she had a mind to visit it on&#xD;
her companion.&#xD;
"You have an errand to me, my dear ?" asked she in-&#xD;
quiringly. Her manner said, the sooner you get it out&#xD;
and go, the better !&#xD;
" I wish to see Dr. llardbake, if you please."&#xD;
" Oh, you desire to present yourself for membership ? "&#xD;
"I don't know what that is; I wan't advice. Miss&#xD;
Margery McWhirter told me the minister was the proper&#xD;
person to understand my needs, and I have come by her&#xD;
instructions to ask him some questions."&#xD;
"I generally attend to the young girls who desire&#xD;
spiritual converse, myself, my dear."&#xD;
"I do not understand what you mean by 'spiritual&#xD;
converse.' Miss Margery said I was to see Doctor" Hard.&#xD;
bake."&#xD;

% "00HE UP INTO .THE CHARIOT OF LOVF'&#xD;
" Very well, go 'to his study then," replied the lady&#xD;
tartly; "the right-hand door, upstairs. Christina, step&#xD;
out and walk six times back and forth, while you rep. at&#xD;
your catechism, and then come in, put up your books, and&#xD;
wash your face for supper."&#xD;
A very loud, gruff voice, replied " Come'in " to Orchis'&#xD;
modest, firm little knock, and she entered the theological&#xD;
sanctum, studded with Calvinism. It hid, away in t '&#xD;
great volumes in the book-cases, frowned from the rather&#xD;
dirty cast of old John's knobby head on a stand in the&#xD;
corner, and the ugly picture of the other John, who&#xD;
made it his boast, that he had caused poor badgered Queen&#xD;
Mary to shed tears with his harsh reproofs, which loomed&#xD;
from its frame on the wall, a charming pair!'. it writhed&#xD;
all over Dr. Hardbake, he was so stuffed crammed with&#xD;
its repellent dogmas, that his very hair stood on end.&#xD;
He was sitting at a table and literally barricaded with )r-&#xD;
thodoxy. Books were also dropped promiscuously about&#xD;
the floor, and Orchis stepped fearfully over them as she&#xD;
advanced. 'A strong odor of cider brandy diffused itself&#xD;
upon the air, and a bottle and glass at the divine's.right&#xD;
hand, seemed to hint that he had been wetting his sermons&#xD;
in ecu de vie as well as brimstone, and a jar of jam near&#xD;
his feet, with a spoon in it, also some smearing about his&#xD;
clanging lips, which dropped loosely at the corners, like&#xD;
,an amiable bull-dog's, showed that the great man re; led&#xD;
himself with sweets, while eliminating good doctrih&#xD;
After a very brusque "good-day," and a tilting of his&#xD;
spectacles to her level, he waited for her to unfold her er-&#xD;
rand. Now there was one natural gift possessed by the&#xD;
reverend Steadfast Goodlove, in which Dr. Ia .dbake&#xD;
was absolutely 4eflcient. ie never forgot nanies,he was&#xD;
ale to speak as familiarly to evevy child in~ his parish as&#xD;
&#xD;
, "uoi  UP INTO THE CHARIOT. O' LOVE." 195&#xD;
their own mothers, which was a good thing, because the&#xD;
little Freddys and Marys felt that Mr. Goodlove knew&#xD;
all about them, and liked them every one. Glad faces&#xD;
always greeted his approach; his "How do you do, my&#xD;
child?" was worth going to Sunday-school for ; he got&#xD;
hold of odd peculiarities and listened to queer confi-&#xD;
dences. Nothing ever astonished him or .put him out,&#xD;
and his laugh over' a youthful joke was as merry as&#xD;
thirteen, and really the hearty way in which he rapped&#xD;
his' dos-a-dos in'" Brother I am bobbed," and romped in&#xD;
"Blind man," was enlivening to see. "Mr. Goodbye,"&#xD;
said a little girl to whom he was explaining the form of&#xD;
uniting with the church, "how do you suppose the Cath-&#xD;
olics do it? "&#xD;
"They put salt in their mouths and feed them with a&#xD;
spoon."&#xD;
On the face of it, it would not look;as if much could&#xD;
be made of this bit of information, but he preached&#xD;
them as good a sermon on the "Salt," as Dow did. on&#xD;
"Malt" when he was forced to hold forth from a stump,&#xD;
by some frolicking fellows. You all remember that dis-&#xD;
course, beginning: "M-my masters, a-all of you,l-hi-&#xD;
ten t-to my text!" when he poured out such stinging re-&#xD;
gfoofs upon their loose lives, that they were glad to slink&#xD;
away and leave the dauntless preacher possessor of the field.&#xD;
Dr. Hardbake never recognized anybody, and had&#xD;
thing to say to children, except, "You must lead pious&#xD;
fives, and come and hear me preach."&#xD;
.Uhe power Orchis possessed over her features, enabled&#xD;
hes to preserve an outward calm, though her. heart&#xD;
thamnped hard and her hands felt cold and moist;,telling.&#xD;
as little of the home-story as might explain hererrand&#xD;
she. waited for the pastor's counsel.&#xD;

196 "COME UP INTO THE CHARIOT OF LOVE."&#xD;
Presently it came, in a great gruff voice, like the great&#xD;
huge bear's when he accused little Silver-hair of eating&#xD;
his porridge:&#xD;
"Do you know your catechism, young woman? "&#xD;
"No sir."&#xD;
"Do you read the Bible every day?"&#xD;
"No sir."&#xD;
" Go to Sunday-school?"&#xD;
"No sir; I have explained that I go nowhere."&#xD;
"Well, your path is plain: learn your Westminstei', at-&#xD;
tend my Bible-class, be in your place in my church every&#xD;
Sunday, and attend to your duty on the farm where Prov-&#xD;
idence has seen fit to put you."&#xD;
"But I desire another life ; I feel that I might be use-&#xD;
ful elsewhere; I want to study."&#xD;
"You can read write and cipher, I suppose ? "&#xD;
''Yes sir."&#xD;
," Very well, that is learning enough for women ; there's&#xD;
teachers in~ plenty already; your vocation is so, plain&#xD;
that it does not need discussing. Learn to make butter&#xD;
and cheese, and when the time comes, marry some young&#xD;
farmer and take care. of his house, raise his children ;&#xD;
what more can you want "&#xD;
"A good deal more," said Orchis. "I want to learn&#xD;
the wealth of books, I want to come as  near as I can to&#xD;
the great minds of the world, to think ;their thoughts,&#xD;
rise to their level. I want to use my brains as well as my&#xD;
hands."         -&#xD;
"Heresy ! rank heresy ! women's rights abomination !&#xD;
a device of the devil! women should be keepers at home.&#xD;
If I had the making of the laws, I would see that they&#xD;
stayed there."&#xD;
" Yoir wife lectures in the public meeting, I hear," said&#xD;
&#xD;
uQOME UP INTO THE CHARIOT OF LOVE." 197.&#xD;
Orchis looking at his red face, and inly wondering how&#xD;
Miss Margery could think this minister would help&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"My wife is-my wife," answered the divine, much put&#xD;
out; "she is no criterion for- any other female in the con-&#xD;
gregation."&#xD;
" I think I had better go," said Orchis, sighing.&#xD;
"I think you had; go home and work. I shall visit your&#xD;
house when I get to it in my round. I will sample your&#xD;
butter and cheese, and approve your housekeeping."&#xD;
The minister smiled ; Orchis' beauty, so perfect, melted&#xD;
him that much, and he dismissed her with the admoni-&#xD;
tion to be a nice decent girl, and she'd be sure to get a&#xD;
husband."&#xD;
Augusta burst into a laugh 4hen Orchis appeared, her&#xD;
. eyes seeking the ground and her face very sober in-&#xD;
deed.&#xD;
"I know what sort of advice you got," said she; "but&#xD;
never mind ; get in and I'll take you home to my mother ;&#xD;
she'll tell you a good many things worth knowing, and&#xD;
my papa shall talk 'with you, and you shall stay to&#xD;
supper, and then Pll drive you home in the evening.&#xD;
"II thank you," replied Orchis, "but I shall notaskaiy&#xD;
more advice; I have made up my mind what I need, and,&#xD;
I shall go straight on now till I get it."&#xD;
"Wouild you mind telling me what it is?" asked&#xD;
Augusta. "I am a rattle-pate, I know; but I cansee as&#xD;
far into a mill-stone as the next one."&#xD;
Orchis looked fixedly at her companion, without reply-&#xD;
in.&#xD;
"What are you staring at?, is my face dirty?" asked&#xD;
Augusta.&#xD;
"Oh no, your face is as white as milk, and your cheeks&#xD;

of you at the.paring-bee."&#xD;
"Well, what was it ? nothing complimentary, I'll en-&#xD;
gage for her."&#xD;
"That is what I want to understand. She said you was&#xD;
loud. I listened; you did not speak louder than she did."&#xD;
I should hope not," answered Augusta coloring up;&#xD;
"that was not what the minx meant either ; I'll pay her&#xD;
off."&#xD;
"What did she mean?2 "&#xD;
"She has been to the city to school, and she brought&#xD;
home a lot of finny fine airs that don't suit me; I speak&#xD;
my mind, and frolic, and act as I please."&#xD;
"Is that being loud?"&#xD;
"Â«If you are sincerelfy in pursuit of knowledge, Orchis,&#xD;
I will tell you: fast and loud come to the same thing ; I&#xD;
am neither."&#xD;
"I don't understand, I am afraid," said Orchis hope-&#xD;
lessly;. "fast and loud."&#xD;
"Well get in anyhow ; you can't expect toknow every-&#xD;
thing at once," replied Augusta, making a place for the girl&#xD;
at her side. " You are far enough from either at any rate,&#xD;
and Miss June will catch Hail Columbia before she.&#xD;
knows it."&#xD;
Hail Columbia I.is not that the title of a National&#xD;
song?".&#xD;
"Do get in, I beg of you; you will kill me outright,&#xD;
I verily believe. If you are quizzing; you had better&#xD;
quit it ; I always pay such debts with interest."&#xD;
Orchis climbed into the carriage . without another&#xD;
word.&#xD;

r CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
&#xD;
"YOU A PREACHER I A WoMAN!&#xD;
ARDLY had the pretty young pilgrim started on&#xD;
her errand that day, when Griselda had a visitor&#xD;
in her turnip-field. A month before, she would&#xD;
have vouchsafed no answer to a greeting, beyond a scant&#xD;
nod, ,or at most a plain good-morning," and gone on&#xD;
with her work. But the late events had regurgitated all&#xD;
ideas in such strange fashion, that the possibility of speak=&#xD;
ing, and being spoken to, had got leave to dwell in her&#xD;
mind, and when the Rev. Colombia Johnson stopped and&#xD;
leaned over the wall, watching her labor and saying:&#xD;
"Good-morrow, fellow-worker; how goes the harvest?"&#xD;
she straightened herself, returned the smile with one of&#xD;
her own quite as genuine, and replied:&#xD;
"As it may be; we sow and hoe, but we do not know&#xD;
how much crop we may gather."&#xD;
"Nay then, my sister, I expect well to gather abund-&#xD;
ance for my toil. I think you do not well know me. I&#xD;
must tell you that I am one Colombia Johnson, the Uni-&#xD;
versalist preacher of yon church. Look, you may see its&#xD;
modest spire through the clearing."&#xD;
" You a preacher ! a woman!"&#xD;
The lady laughed at the tone of the exclamation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7820-00000100"/>&#xD;
" YOU A PREA$.F'R! A WOMAN!"&#xD;

&#xD;
she stood the fire of the look which was poured over her,&#xD;
covering the fine bunches of small curls gathered from&#xD;
her wide forehead at either temple ; her bright, sweet,&#xD;
quick, vivacious ways ; her admirably dressed little per-&#xD;
son ; the good, solid time-keeping watch in her belt; the&#xD;
golden buckle at her waist; the handsome brooch at her&#xD;
throat; her biern gants, bien chausss hands and feet, every&#xD;
detail perfect.&#xD;
" Yes, wherefore not ? I've a glib tongue ; I love to&#xD;
use it. Fine health;. I am not afraid to trust it ; and a will&#xD;
to work for my kind. I am going now to visit young&#xD;
IHarry Scramble, who cut his leg on a reaper up at the&#xD;
Blossom  farm.  I shall watch with him to-night; his&#xD;
mother is one of the weaklings, who get used up in child-&#xD;
bearing, and only drag life forever afterwards. She is&#xD;
not much of a nurse; a wooden woman would do almost&#xD;
as well; she can't afford doctors in general; but I make&#xD;
my good Mattoon to attend, and lay up the bill, which he&#xD;
will never get cashed, among his treasures in heaven. I&#xD;
have fairknowledge of simples, myself. I know when&#xD;
babies need catnip; when fevers call for nitre; when&#xD;
broken bones deserve wormwood."&#xD;
"A preacher ! " repeated Griselda, still busy with the&#xD;
first bit of information Colombia had offered her.&#xD;
"I have half a mind to be angry with you," replied the&#xD;
visitor, pointing her forefinger at the thoughtful girl in&#xD;
the shaker bonnet. "I am indeed ! you show too much&#xD;
astonishment. Do you mean to make me understand that&#xD;
my name and fame have not travelled so far as your,&#xD;
meadows, and I a whole year your neighbor by a couple&#xD;
of miles! In truth, it is hard to swallow!"&#xD;
"As for your fame, it might fly far, all around the&#xD;
country, and never touch us by the weight of a thistle-&#xD;
&#xD;
down; we live as much apart, as if there were no world&#xD;
outside our land."&#xD;
"And do you like it? this life so private ? "&#xD;
"It is no question of liking," replied Griselda, coming&#xD;
up to the wall, and leaning on her hoe, while she looked&#xD;
in her visitor's face; " it was a necessity thrust upon us ;&#xD;
wewere pushed into it, head foremost. It took us as sud-&#xD;
denly as an earthquake; it whirled us from our rooted&#xD;
customs, as.swiftly as a tornado snaps away the saplings."&#xD;
"Would you like to tell me the necessity?" asked Co-&#xD;
lombia, intently studying the talker, her rapid words, her&#xD;
eager manner, her delicate slenderness, fine and supple,&#xD;
her careless forgetting of personal charms, so absolute as&#xD;
to seem unconscious of them. "Will you speak of your&#xD;
past? I almost think you ought ; your eyes have a hun-&#xD;
gry craving for human sympathy, and womanly benefi-&#xD;
cence. I have heard of you; the people hereabouts are&#xD;
not silent upon your habits. It is natural to denounce&#xD;
what we do not understand, and much fault is found with&#xD;
your odd ways, your ignoring of the noble creature, Man,&#xD;
in your life. I, being one of the glorious company ot&#xD;
martyrs known as old maids, see-nothing strange in your&#xD;
independence ; and I came this way to day, partly to peep &#xD;
at your flowers, and partly to try another chance of see-&#xD;
ing some of my sisters out of bonds. Come, speak ! I am&#xD;
a minister on purpose to hold cares for my people. Al&#xD;
universally work."&#xD;
" Universal ! your creed is too wide; it takes.in every-&#xD;
body. I do not like it," answered Griselda frowning.&#xD;
"There are wretches for whom an eternity of misery is&#xD;
too short."&#xD;
"It won't harm you to believe in the best and fullest&#xD;
aid for all sufferers; the widest good for all; the amplest&#xD;

compensation for all mistakes ; the supremest joy for all&#xD;
capable of being made happy."&#xD;
"That is all very well; but I do not desire to jump out&#xD;
of this life into one where the accursed, for whom I can&#xD;
imagine no adequate pangs, shall b sailing about in plen-&#xD;
tiful enjoyment. No! I must have a hell in my creed.&#xD;
There are a few monsters, whom I hope to see burning&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"You have all the hell you need right here," answered&#xD;
Colombia, smiting her breast with her small fist, "while&#xD;
you cherish the spirit of hate and all uncharitableness.&#xD;
God's high heaven would be but a dreary prison in that&#xD;
graceless state. But I won't preach a sermon here; you&#xD;
shall promise to come and hear me clear that dogma--i'ub-&#xD;
bish collected by men, who invest God with their own&#xD;
revenge and cruelty-satisfactorily away in my pulpit. I&#xD;
feel fully able to prove the excellence of my doctrines&#xD;
for comfort and growth, and that is what we need; a&#xD;
good deal more than to launch damnation at our enemies.&#xD;
Come,let us drop the professional, and visit alittle in true&#xD;
womanly fashion. I want to hear you talk."&#xD;
A small wiry creature was the Rev. Colombia who had&#xD;
come into her vocation through a regular gradation of ex-&#xD;
periences, which many young girls commence, but the&#xD;
glad acme of which very few attain. A. loving, quiet,&#xD;
retiring child ; a studious5 busy maid ; a plain woman, not&#xD;
attractive to the other sex. She finished school with&#xD;
honors, read all the books in her way, thought out her&#xD;
thoughts, and then being set free from the routine of her&#xD;
daily employments, she looked around to find what next ;.&#xD;
and chafed and fretted under the aimless life she saw be-&#xD;
fore her.'&#xD;
Her mother chided hen restlessness, and- said : " How&#xD;
&#xD;
"YOU A PREACHER! A WcOMANV"          20a&#xD;
wrong, Colombia! You must be content with woman's&#xD;
sphere of little occupations; you must make the house&#xD;
pleasant to your papa's, friends."&#xD;
Then she dutifully tried housekeeping, sewing, writing,&#xD;
and pursing sweet lips at the people about her, listening&#xD;
to thpir talk, and saying small nothings in reply. Then&#xD;
she flew at-her piano, but though she loved music as a&#xD;
refreshment, she could not find enough in it to fill all her&#xD;
soul, and she discerned nothing in all to compensate for&#xD;
the daily weariness.&#xD;
Mrs. Johnson watched her daughter, spiritless, uninter-&#xD;
ested, her face a dull blank, and being at her wits' end,&#xD;
finally carried her perplexities to her minister. He rec-&#xD;
ommended religious reading, and sent the girl a whole&#xD;
armful of doctrinal books.&#xD;
Dutiful again, Colombia went through them, but she&#xD;
came out at a different door from what her teachers ex-&#xD;
peeted, even by the gate called "Beautiful," which stands&#xD;
open to all who desire to enter the celestial city. (This,&#xD;
mind you, dear readers,'is Colombia's account of herself&#xD;
given to Griselda, who leaned over the wall, and eagerly&#xD;
drank in her words ; I endorse fione of her statements.)&#xD;
The more the seeker sought, the. more she abhorred the&#xD;
narrow cieeds of Calvinism, the more she longed for the&#xD;
full life, the well-guarded rest, she found at last for all&#xD;
God's children.&#xD;
At a certain point in her struggles, there came into her&#xD;
arms a beautiful, helpless baby sister, all hers to nurse,&#xD;
Â° tend, love, worship.  The mother lay ill upstairs for&#xD;
months and months, and Colombia stood in her lot among&#xD;
the household cares. Despite all her cherishing, all her&#xD;
fondness, the child sickened and died, " unbaptized, un-&#xD;
regenerate, lost," said her church ; "saved, gathered home&#xD;
&#xD;

''  O4 ,"  YO.U A PREA CBER ! A I OMAN!"&#xD;
to the infinite motherliness of God," said her heart; and&#xD;
there bending over its bier, she found the Christ she&#xD;
needed.&#xD;
Made in God's image, she discovered some points of&#xD;
the likeness. The Christ who loves, who pities those He&#xD;
loves-; who loves and pities, therefore suffers with the ob-&#xD;
jects of affection ; no longer an abstract, a cold, distant,&#xD;
unapproachable, self-absorbed Intelligence, but a real&#xD;
Friend. No troubles too inconsiderable to bring to the&#xD;
sympathy of a Christ who numbered all the hairs of our&#xD;
heads. It is safe to commit all interests of all creatures&#xD;
to such a God. He made them all. He has not forgotten&#xD;
the world. He must bring every soul into its best place.&#xD;
Somewhere, some time in the round eternity, every crea-&#xD;
ted soul being only finite, must come into the largest de-&#xD;
velopnent of its bestowed powers; and as its growing&#xD;
love and trust and excellence bring it nearer to God, till&#xD;
it expands into the perfected perennial beauty and glory&#xD;
he desires, who is able to disturb its heaven?"&#xD;
When the mother was well again in her own place,&#xD;
Colombia avowed her new-found faith, and also a desire&#xD;
to find a parish, where. she could teach its comforts and&#xD;
helps to those troubled, perplexed, and tried as she -had&#xD;
been. So strong and steady was the wish, the inspiration&#xD;
of her purpose, that she carried the will and wishes of her,&#xD;
parents along with her, and under advice and aid of a&#xD;
great and good man, whose life shines with deeds of&#xD;
kindness, whose work is helping, she pushed on, finished&#xD;
her studies, got a license, and was working in her first&#xD;
parish, Cherry Brook.&#xD;
She found there what she sought; people poorer than&#xD;
she, whom she could assist; people more ignorant, whom&#xD;
she .could. teach ; tempted ones, whom she could watch&#xD;

&#xD;
for, and pluck out of evil; and her days were rich with&#xD;
labors, interests, responsibilities, and satisfactions, which&#xD;
made it worth living.&#xD;
"It is what I want !" exclaimed Griselda, entranced&#xD;
with the vivid picture. "Is there as ample room in your&#xD;
field for labor, as there is in your faith for consolation ?&#xD;
May I not come and live with you, help you, love you,&#xD;
even as you love your Christ and toil for His children ? I&#xD;
shall be no burden in any wise ; iy hands are used to&#xD;
use, my head is clear and cool, and my body is a faithful&#xD;
servant of my soul. I do not lack money; I ask only a&#xD;
footing in God's world, with something to do for myself&#xD;
and my kind."&#xD;
"Let in first hear the necessity you spoke of," replied&#xD;
Colombia cautiously; "it may be you. are already in your&#xD;
best position; you shall come and see me at any rate,lear-n&#xD;
how I live, and what I do."&#xD;
"iMay I trust you?" said Griselda half to herself; " it is&#xD;
hard story, a painful time to recall;'it wraps us all in. If&#xD;
I could 'longer carry my burdens, I would not open my&#xD;
lips, but something has happened lately among us, which&#xD;
has stirred all our hearts, and filled us with unrest. Now&#xD;
you come to me with your earnest face, your winning&#xD;
voice, your sense of power, and my blood thrills in my&#xD;
veins. I see the outside world rife with struggles, want-&#xD;
-ing in workers, open to me. I feel that I may step out&#xD;
and set my shoulder to the wheel with the rest of the&#xD;
toilers. I shall speak!"&#xD;
" A terrible tale, indeed!" exclaimed Colombia, when&#xD;
she had heard all. "If only a strong, brave friend had&#xD;
come forward, how different it might have been. I could&#xD;
weep to think of your sister ! such glorious womanhood&#xD;
wrecked, lost out of value; the rest of you may come back&#xD;

"Clytie, oh no ! she would not permit you to come near&#xD;

"I shall not settle to any such impossibility ; I will&#xD;

human wickedness have disgusted you."&#xD;
"A little of both, perhaps; but I am not constitution-&#xD;
ally timid; my fear of the creatures who are of the same&#xD;
clay with me, fashioned like mine, shall not hinder my&#xD;
steppingig in any path I decide on. I have not dwelt&#xD;
among angels the last five years'; only girls,the same as&#xD;

without anything to wear."&#xD;
"Oh! a Flora McFlimsey out here on a great farm 1&#xD;
Well, that is original and interesting !" replied the Rev.&#xD;
Colombia, laughing.&#xD;
"I do not uandestand your allusion; I never heard of&#xD;
the person you quote. You suggested to me the impos-&#xD;
sibility of coming into your parlor in this " (touching the&#xD;
sleeve of her homespun gown). "I know I shall carry&#xD;
my name, 'old maid,' with me wherever I go; Orchis&#xD;
and Candace hd it thrown at them over there " (jerking&#xD;
her head defiantly awards the Balquither house), " where&#xD;
they say there are five more of them. Therefore, unless&#xD;
you can help me out of your abundant wisdom, to a gown&#xD;

cock, I must be better shod. -I am not unskilled in those&#xD;
needs, but five years of disuse make me rusty, that's&#xD;
all."&#xD;
" And opportunity will soon rub off the rust, I believe,&#xD;
into a polish as agreeable as exquisite," said Colombia,&#xD;
admiring the girl, who was as handsome as Clorinda.&#xD;
"Clear it out of sight at all events, I fully expect ; and&#xD;
as my sister Vashti shares my bed and board, and all my&#xD;
best thought's, she must .also share my enfranchisement; I&#xD;

two were to come with me now to my dress-maker and be&#xD;

"Impossible! I'd rather face your young people than&#xD;
the staring, curious, under-bred workers in a dress-&#xD;
maker's loft. J am a born lady, li~ss Colombia; you are&#xD;
able to feel it. Those people who rate women by their&#xD;
clothes would  ok down on me ; I fane  t undertake to&#xD;
run any such gauntlet. You will please devise some way&#xD;
of bringing the things complete to us. When I step out&#xD;
of my shell I wili go, as you say, 'clad in armor.' You&#xD;
universally help, therefore this comes in your province."&#xD;
* "True, Grisel, every need I can supply is in my line;&#xD;
therefore I see no occasion to look black over a lack of&#xD;
clothes. Hum! there is Cynthia Mattoon, she is about&#xD;
your size : full bust, good shoulders; not too fine in the'&#xD;
waist; I think she will do,-and I dare say you have&#xD;
needle skill to alter what does not exactly fit. I will be&#xD;
here, Deo Volente, with two plum-colored; dresses Thurs-&#xD;

therefore commend me to the sister,-,what did you call&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"Yashti."&#xD;
Ah! the stropg-minded queen who wouldn't come at&#xD;
her lord's bidding. Has her dignity any plans for the&#xD;
future?9 "&#xD;
"1None that I can unfold to you. She has capabilities ;&#xD;
she will herself speak of herself."&#xD;
" Quite right; not given to babbling, I perceive; a&#xD;
good thing in an embryo minister, who is very likely to be&#xD;
&#xD;
"YOU A PREACHER! A WOMAN!"&#xD;
&#xD;
the adviser .of her flock. Now I must travel on; you&#xD;
have offered ine much matter to ponder over till we&#xD;
meet again."&#xD;
You may be sure that little time passed before Griselda&#xD;
poured her new hopes and prospects into her twin sister's&#xD;
ears, and they sat long under the yellow chestnuts talk-&#xD;
ing not much about the. old life before the fall, nor yet&#xD;
of the quenched existence they had shared on the farm,&#xD;
but of the opening future; strengthening each other, fir-&#xD;
ing each other's zeal, and also building air-castles,-what&#xD;
girl's future is not full of them? In this case, however,&#xD;
no man was admitted, wished for, thought of; lovers,&#xD;
husbands, were not reckoned among the blessings they&#xD;
coveted.&#xD;
"I will have a home of my own, and on the door-plate&#xD;
- I will put, ',Reverend Griselda Dunwreath, LL.D.".&#xD;
"No house-keeping trammels for me. I will build an&#xD;
office; I will also build up a practice. I will heal dis-&#xD;
eases, cast out devils. I will get to myself skeletons,&#xD;
drugs, and patients. I will have a door-plate and a&#xD;
night-bell: ' Vashti Dunwreath, Physician and Surgeon.'&#xD;
It is a good life, sister. Now courage and perseverance&#xD;
till we reach our goal. In the meantime we must finish&#xD;
our day's work."&#xD;
So saying, the two arose and kissed each other soberly,&#xD;
and bent vigorously to the task in hand, hoping for the&#xD;
realization of the busy future they meant to make.&#xD;

CHAPTER  XXI.&#xD;
OROHIS TAKES TEA AT THE BLOSSOMS.&#xD;
HE invitation to the home of the Blossoms was&#xD;
readily accepted by Orchis Dunwreath, as part&#xD;
of the purpose she had in hand, to find out for&#xD;
herself what sort of interiors there might be in the&#xD;
houses about her; and she made an excellent start with&#xD;
the jolly, well-to-do farmers, who lived in plenty, denied&#xD;
themselves nothing they desired, petted and loved their&#xD;
children; and got all out. of country life it was able to&#xD;
afford, both of occupation and recreation,&#xD;
Mrs. Blossom was a full-blown bloom; rosy, fair, and&#xD;
comfortable. She carried in her appearance nothing of&#xD;
the sour, thin, wiry, over-worked look, which marks too&#xD;
often the aspect of the farmer's wife, whose life is all hard&#xD;
lines: cooking, washing, scrubbing, till there is nothing&#xD;
else left in it except, maybe, a taste for gossip-the days&#xD;
being a dreary, steady grind; worse, infinitely worse,&#xD;
than poor Mantalini's at-the mangle. Mrs. Blossom had&#xD;
serving men and serving maids ; and she took her ease in&#xD;
such portions of time as were hers, when her overlooking&#xD;
was done.&#xD;
Mr. Blossom always took his wife a trip "after har-&#xD;
vest." When he went to "the city," he couldn't half en-&#xD;
joy his business or pleasure unless "Violet, my dear,"&#xD;
&#xD;
ORCIS TAKES TEA AT/THE BLOSSOMS.        211&#xD;
was along to hear all about it. It cost more money to&#xD;
farm it on the Blossom plan, but it paid. "Man never is,&#xD;
but always to be blessed," was-no part ,of his theory or&#xD;
practice; he believed in getting something nice out of&#xD;
every day in the year. "If we die in any sort of sea-&#xD;
son," said he, "we shall have enough to last us out, and&#xD;
enough to spoil the young ones beside; and I can better&#xD;
afford to have Nancy waste.a cheese once in a while,&#xD;
than I can to see my Violet 'et blowzy over the hot fire&#xD;
drudging and fretting." Don't you wish, wives, there&#xD;
were more men in the farming-line, of bluff Mr. Blos-&#xD;
som's-mind&#xD;
A stone wall claimed the attention just now of the&#xD;
ruddy gentleman.  "Yeoman" I suppose he would be&#xD;
called in lands where there are lords to whom common&#xD;
folk must take off their hats; but our farmers, 'artisans,&#xD;
tradespeople, all! may be gentlefolk, if they lift them-&#xD;
selves to their right level of sovereigns, by intelligence&#xD;
and true living; for which, thank Heaven and our free&#xD;
democracy ! "A church without a bishop, and a state&#xD;
without a king."&#xD;
As soon as the gentle yeoman espied the phaeton and&#xD;
its fair occupants, he left his work aid came a little way&#xD;
down the grassy road to look at them, admire the pretty&#xD;
turn ut, and the handsome girls.&#xD;
Porn nd Precious Plunket also, approached; having'&#xD;
just returned from a successful wood-chuck hunt, as was.&#xD;
vouched by a couple of big fellows they carried slung on&#xD;
a pole across their shoulders.&#xD;
"Let ins get out here and walk up to the house," sug-&#xD;
gested Augusta. " Here, Pop" (thus she irreverently ac-&#xD;
costed her male parent), "make Mike take Zilpah to the&#xD;
stable, please; we are through with her."&#xD;

212 QRHIS TAKES TEA AT THE BLOSSOM.&#xD;
As Orchis stepped to the ground, they all looked at-&#xD;
her. Such a quaint, simple girl as she appeared ; such&#xD;
high-bred, delicately outlined beauty too. Her hat was&#xD;
of rye-straw platted, high-crowned, broad-brimmed as a&#xD;
Swiss peasant's, yellow as burnished gold; and around&#xD;
it Augusta had woven great clusters of flaming autumn&#xD;
leaves, maples, crimson and yellow-purple ash, and the&#xD;
slim, shining sumac. Her dress was of red flannel, spun&#xD;
and dyed by Goody IRuddock; her stockings of knitted&#xD;
yarn ; her shoes clumsy, home-made, and ill-shapen ; but&#xD;
the plain garments could not mar or detract from her&#xD;
pure beauty, so they all felt. Mr. Blossom took both&#xD;
her hands and welcomed hei- heartily.&#xD;
"Glad to see you! Nice .girl! Come often; stay a&#xD;
good-while !"&#xD;
Porn made a sidling, jerking bow, blushing to his hair;&#xD;
and Precious looked as pleased as possible.&#xD;
"How much did you give apiece for those horrid crea-&#xD;
tures ?" asked Augusta of the hunters.  "You would&#xD;
have been wiser to save your pennies to buy sugar-whistles ;&#xD;
wouldn't they, Orchis ?"&#xD;
"I supposed they had shot them," said Orchis, simply ;&#xD;
"they have guns, you see."&#xD;
"That's what they desire us to believe, but I know&#xD;
their tricks and their miners: they carry the guns for&#xD;
show. They don't load them; they're afraid to."&#xD;
"Give me leave to fire mine at you?" asked Precious,&#xD;
letting off the game-pole and 'raising the gun to his&#xD;
shoulder, taking aim.&#xD;
"No ! no! don't shoot ! Pop, make him put it down,"&#xD;
screamed Augusta; "he might hit me!"&#xD;
"Ha! ha!" roared Mr. Blossom, "you are caught ;&#xD;
fairly caught, Gussy, in your own trap. You shouldn't&#xD;

oREHIS TAKES TEA AT THE BLOSSOMS:" 213&#xD;
ever do that though, my boy, even in fun; so many acci-&#xD;
dents have happened out of just such, nonsense. I can't&#xD;
bear to see anybody fool with a gun."&#xD;
"It is not loaded, sir " answered Precious; "I would&#xD;
not have lifted it else. I put the charge into that fellow"&#xD;
-turning over the woodchuck with. his toe-" there,&#xD;
you see, right between the eyes."&#xD;
"A good shot!" said Mr. Blossom. "Come, and I'll&#xD;
show our new hen-barn, which I have fitted out of the old&#xD;
ice-house."&#xD;
" It was an ice-house, it is a nice house, it will be a lice-&#xD;
house in due time," observed Precious.&#xD;
" Oh Moses! what a plagney Egyptian suggestion," said&#xD;
Augusta. "Now, I dare say, June Rose would call that&#xD;
loud," she added, turning to Orchis. "Let her, if she&#xD;
pleases. Pop likes me ; don't you, Pop?"&#xD;
"Like is no word for it, Gussy; you are the joy of my&#xD;
heart and the pride of my life."&#xD;
"I know it, Pop. My Pop is a brick! I don't mean&#xD;
baked clay, Orchis, but a pressed composition of good-&#xD;
ness. Don't look as puzzled as if you were trying to&#xD;
spell out a Greek lesson. There is. mother beckoning to&#xD;
us, so I expect supper is ready. You'll stop of course,&#xD;
Precious. It is a pity we haven't time to cook the&#xD;
boughten woodchuck."&#xD;
1irs. Blossom received them pleasantly, and Daisy&#xD;
brought out all her playthings. Of course Augusta de-&#xD;
tailed her reception at the minister's, which called forth&#xD;
characteristic exclamations from each listener.&#xD;
"I am not much surprised," said Mrs. Blossom; "I am&#xD;
afraid the people have made a sad mistake' in dismissing&#xD;
our dear Mr. Goodlove.  Doctrine is . all well enough,&#xD;
but a helpful life is also good and necessary."&#xD;

"Good for you, Guss!" said Mr._Blossom. " No tur-&#xD;
keys shall go there Christmas ; no butter and0 cheese&#xD;
Thanksgiving, shall there ?"&#xD;
The pleasant sociability of the tea-table ; the jokes and&#xD;
fun; the songs and waltzes afterward (Augusta's music&#xD;
was a great feature in the Blossom interior); "The Shep-&#xD;

prayer at her mother's knee, upstairs where she was in-&#xD;

child to sleep; the crooning song of lullaby. It was like&#xD;
a long-forgotten dream revived in her heart.&#xD;
"I shall never forget this visit, never! "said she, hold-&#xD;
ing the lady's hand at parting. "It has done me good.&#xD;
My mother was as much to me as you are to Daisy. I&#xD;
feel almost as if I had seen her."&#xD;

matron. " I like you very much ; you sally come again,&#xD;

Precious Plunket walked home with her. " He looked&#xD;
as if he wanted to," said Augusta, "and so I let him."&#xD;
The school plan was discussed, elaborated, and settled.&#xD;
" I am so glad you are really coming, " said he, when&#xD;
they reached the gate. "I shall be sure of one earnest&#xD;
scholar."&#xD;
"Oh yes, I am earnest," answered Orchis; "I have&#xD;
no time to trifle with so much to do."&#xD;
"Jingo peltus ! or rather I should say, ahem! I was&#xD;
going to remark that I should be glad when the time&#xD;
really comes."&#xD;
' "So shall I; I long to begin. - But I hope you won't&#xD;

"Severe! . Miss Orchis, I could never be anything&#xD;
but the kindest 4fthe kind to you."&#xD;
"I hope so ; but I feel that I shall have hard work. I&#xD;
don't know how to study."&#xD;
The sisters were on the watch, and rushed down to the&#xD;
gate with her first call.&#xD;
"t Why, where have you been?" exclaimed Vashti;&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
&#xD;
DR. MATTOON AND THE PAPER CAPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALF an hour before the time named Colombia&#xD;
knocked at the gate, with a huge bundle under&#xD;
her arm-.&#xD;
Griselda and Vashti proved their true womanhood by&#xD;
the haste and ardor they put into the business of "trying&#xD;
on," and the first eager question," How do I look?" came&#xD;
simultaneously from each bright voice, and was answered&#xD;
by admiring eyes before a word was spoken.&#xD;
The minister enjoyed herself immensely. All her fac~-&#xD;
ulties were alert, and her imagination was kindled by this&#xD;
new phase of existence, so widely differing from any of&#xD;
her former experiences. She gazed at one and the other,&#xD;
listened .curiously to their talk, sharing their assurance,&#xD;
laborating their expectations, and left them full of the,&#xD;
coming evening, the wax flowers, and the sociability they&#xD;
were to enter upon.&#xD;
Colombia's pretty house was all alight when the visitors&#xD;
were ushered into her cheery parlor, where twenty or&#xD;
-nore young people were seated around a table upon&#xD;
which were saucers of wax, rolls of green paper, and cut&#xD;
flowers, some of which were being modelled, petal by'&#xD;
petal, while vases of finished beauties were scattered' up&#xD;
and down: roses, lilies of the valley, lupmes and rock col-&#xD;
&#xD;
umbine.   About half the- party were young men, who&#xD;
helped the work and the pleasure. Four' two ladies and&#xD;
two gentlemen; were seated at a small table, and held in&#xD;
their hands volumes of Shakespeare, from which they were&#xD;
reading "Julius Cesar," for their own amusement and&#xD;
the improvement of all who chose to listen. -At such times&#xD;
as the hum of voices proclaimed that the audience desired&#xD;
to use their own tongues, Columbia gave the signal Uf&#xD;
rest, and much discussion of the play followed. Spirited&#xD;
coinments on the text, anecdotes of actors, bits of history,&#xD;
short poetical recitations, droll stories swiftly succeeded&#xD;
each other. The minister and magnate of the evening&#xD;
stipulated that the talk should hug the subject in hand&#xD;
during the i-our of study, and she knew well how to carry&#xD;
her point, keeping herself alert to hold the minds of all&#xD;
where she willed them to fasten. When the play was&#xD;
finished and the:especial theme dropped, the conversation&#xD;
still ran oq(, for every one present had gotten something&#xD;
to think of Qut of it; aid where there are thoughts, words&#xD;
are sure to give them utterance.&#xD;
This result was not jumped on, by any means, but had&#xD;
been the offspring of time, and patience, and will, on the&#xD;
part of the minister, who wasdetermined to bring up her-&#xD;
young people to the ability to fill a whole evening agree-&#xD;
ably, without gossip or the kissing games, which she found&#xD;
the occupation of all gatherings when she undertook her&#xD;
parish.&#xD;
As. the play was selected beforehand,'and the readers&#xD;
appointed, they were quite likely to look over it and pre-&#xD;
pare themselves ; and outsiders were sometimes mystified)&#xD;
to come upon these young folks, spouting their favorite&#xD;
parts, which worked into their lives with a subtile force&#xD;
the great poet is sure to wield.&#xD;

&#xD;
It seemed evident that the-new guests were expected ;&#xD;
and though a little flutter of curiosity could not be, re-&#xD;
pressed, there was only so much permitted to come to the&#xD;
surface as to make them the centre of joyful welcome,&#xD;
and places were quickly made for them at the large table,&#xD;
and scissors and green paper thrust into their hands.&#xD;
Vashti got seated beside a nice, fresh girl to whom Co..&#xD;
lomnbia introduced her. ..'&#xD;
" Zulah Pancrost, I have brought you a new friend ;-&#xD;
now be sure you give her a good impression of us'Univer.&#xD;
salists."&#xD;
Griselda found herself next a young gentleman .who&#xD;
was very busy cutting out paper caps from a pile of col-&#xD;
ored tissues before him; and as' he rose to make room for&#xD;
her, he stuck a finished one on' his head, of pale green&#xD;
with crimson front,.that he might lift it in her honor as&#xD;
he made his bow in a frank, easy way.&#xD;
"Soyez la bien venue ma scour," said he ; "see, I am&#xD;
so driven and burdened with work, that I will be thankful&#xD;
for a coadjutor."&#xD;
Griselda stared a little at his facile address, and only&#xD;
wondered if that was the present fashion of gentlemanly&#xD;
salutation.  Finding only courtesy in his looks as he&#xD;
waited for her to be seated before continuing his occupa-&#xD;
tion, she slid into the offered chair, and turned her face&#xD;
toward him, and fixed on his eyes her handsome, well-&#xD;
opened ones, attending closely to his conversation.&#xD;
You see, Miss Dunwreath," he explained, "'we intend&#xD;
having a Sunday-school festival at Christmas, and our -&#xD;
minister has ordered that all the chorus boys wear these&#xD;
caps ; as there are about fifty young whipsters to get into&#xD;
uniform, somebody's scissors have got to snip nimbly.&#xD;

" I believe I am able to be that partner," said she;&#xD;
"only show me where and how to set the needful stiches."&#xD;
"There and here," said he, deftly folding his pattern&#xD;
into shape, and fitting it on his head, while he held the&#xD;
soft, crumply stuff in place with his two hands, and smiled&#xD;
down upon her. "There and here'; you perceive ? "&#xD;
"Yes," she replied, "I think I understand. But how&#xD;
very odd! I never heard of such a thing, to take such&#xD;
trouble for trifles of no use or consequence. Miss Colom.&#xD;
bia spoke of earnest work ; can this, tissue-paper foolery&#xD;
be a part of it ?" she added, thinking aloud.&#xD;
" Yes, Miss Dunwreath, this is a part of the work, quite&#xD;
as necessary as the Sunday contributions, Scripture verses,&#xD;
and Christmas hymns. You see we are to have a dramatic&#xD;
opera, or operatic drama; your humble servant is engaged&#xD;
in compiling it in all the odd times he can glean out of&#xD;
his days, and the chorus do a good deal of marching and&#xD;
singing. -Those long strips of paper on which my sister&#xD;
Matilda is pasting gorgeous gilt stars are scarfs ; they go&#xD;
with the caps, and we expect the effect to be rather bewil-&#xD;
dering. The object and aim of our trouble is to tickle the&#xD;
youthful mind, give the youths and maidens a happy&#xD;
Christmas which they may remember. We are Catholic&#xD;
(universal, you understand,) in centring our good times&#xD;
in the church ; we expect in that way to keep fur youing-&#xD;
sters among us; we nurse and fondle them that we may&#xD;
hold their love. As they get their best and fullest enjoy-&#xD;
ments out of our providence, we shall teach them also&#xD;
what life is good for; coax them home when they wan-&#xD;
der, give them comfort and strength. We believe in&#xD;
banded labor and amusements; we aim at being true.&#xD;

churchmen in all things; we are willing our minister&#xD;
should lead her flock beside the still waters, among the&#xD;
green pastures, and we mean to follow her closely, as do-&#xD;
cile sheep follow a good shepherd. Have I made plain&#xD;
the work part of the 'tiss'ue-paper foolery,' Miss Dun-&#xD;
wreath ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, I perceive there be many paths leading&#xD;
to the same goal; if I can only get started'on the right&#xD;
one."&#xD;
As her fellow-worker watched her face and saw how&#xD;
she finished her sentence with her eyes afar off, thinking&#xD;
of something he had no business with, he did not interrupt&#xD;
her with any questions, though several rose in his mind&#xD;
which he would have liked to ask and get answered.&#xD;
Miss Colombia's thimble tapping the table, asked si-&#xD;
lence and attention presently, and Griselda's thoughts&#xD;
came back to those about her, and she had time to turn&#xD;
over what she had heard, as well as to examine her neigh-&#xD;
bors, which she did with the intent scrutiny'of a fresh&#xD;
coiner into a place among her equals.&#xD;
After the next meeting-place was appointed, the readers&#xD;
announced, and the business settled, the minister drew a&#xD;
paper from her pocket and read a list of names, each of&#xD;
which called out comments and jokes, some so purely.&#xD;
local that she could not share them, but which were pleas-&#xD;
ant on account of the mutual good feeling and interest&#xD;
they showed.&#xD;
"Zulah Pancrost, biscuit !" was the first annunciation.&#xD;
" No, no! feed us cannon-balls," said one of the young&#xD;
men.&#xD;
" Cannon-balls !" retorted Zulah,. " we all know how&#xD;
you would turn pale at sight of one."&#xD;

"'Twould not do for you 1o eat green things, on the prin-&#xD;

"I hear that pearlash has gone up, Zulah, since you&#xD;
exhausted the supply," said Fritz Heartson.&#xD;
"CHave you heard that the best use of a cane is to beat&#xD;
puppies ?" rejoined Zulah, borrowing a bamboo stick&#xD;
which leaned against the mantel, and administering a&#xD;
sharp rap with it across the shoulders of the saucy joker.&#xD;
"Order ! order ! " said Colombia,,tapping the table.&#xD;
"But Miss Colombia," said Dora Sinclair, "is it not a&#xD;
pity boys cannot cook? Fritz might fetch us such nice&#xD;
home-made vanities."&#xD;
" how vain are all things here below; how vain, but yet&#xD;
how -fair, especially pretty Zulah Pancrost," answered&#xD;
Fritz, bowing to his teasing neighbor.&#xD;
"I will contribute a basl4et of miracles," said Matilda&#xD;
Mattoon.&#xD;
"Oh no, the age of miracles has past ; make us some&#xD;
johnny-cakes," said William Underwood.&#xD;
"Impossible," replied Matilda, very red in the face;&#xD;
" we are out of molasses. I can't get trusted; Ihate long&#xD;
bills."&#xD;
"Squelched, William," said Fritz triumphantly ; "but&#xD;
give us your hand; we will sympathize; you need to learn&#xD;
a lesson. Never try answers with the soft creatures, who&#xD;
are as tenacious of 'the last word as Snip's wife."&#xD;
"Attention, young people !" said the minister at this&#xD;
point. "Let me explain to our new friends, whom we&#xD;
hope to enlist among us. We have a rule that all the&#xD;
eatables shall be furnished by the members, each girl&#xD;
cooking what she offers for our consumption: And we&#xD;

pay dear sometimes for the whistle, too, because we have&#xD;
agreed that any eatable which was a failure shall be&#xD;
fetched a second, third, and even fourth time if it is nec-&#xD;
essary, till it is a success, by the same person, so as to&#xD;
insure progress in cooking as well as mind and man-&#xD;
ners-"&#xD;
After the guests were, mostly gone, the Rev. Colombia&#xD;
came around and clasped Griselda's fingers in her own&#xD;
little wiry ones. "Well Grisel, how do you like it as far&#xD;
as you have got?"&#xD;
"Exeellently !" replied Griselda slyly ; "I desire to&#xD;
get so much farther, though, as to find out the name of&#xD;
the gentleman I have been pulling caps with."&#xD;
"Just like my carelessness !" exclaimed Colombia,&#xD;
"not to mention it. You see you were the object I had&#xD;
in my mind, the rest came in second best. It is our good&#xD;
Dr. Mattoon, the best fellow in the parish, the main depe-d.&#xD;
ence and right hand of all my enterprises. le believes.&#xD;
our creed, and he lives it out universally. Here, doctor! let&#xD;
meformally present you to my friend, Miss Dunwreath,&#xD;
whose acquaintance you have already made."&#xD;
"Thank you, Parson! the name does not matter much,&#xD;
especially a lady's, it so soon gets changed for the cogno-&#xD;
men."&#xD;
"Mine never will ; I shall go Dunwreath to my grave!"&#xD;
said Griselda, with a mien of positive conviction.&#xD;
"Yes sir, you may as well know at once, 0risel is go-&#xD;
ing to study for the ministry, and head a parish."&#xD;
"And have my name on the door-plate as you have,&#xD;
Miss Johnson," added Griselda soberly.&#xD;
"_And very well it will look too. Now here's Miss&#xD;

she must tread. Together we' will walk the hospitals,&#xD;
full of wounds and bruises and putrifying sores; together&#xD;
we will prowl into churchyards, dig open graves, steal&#xD;

will prove no laggard," said Colombia briskly.&#xD;
 Griselda looked inquiringly at her twin,, who nodded,&#xD;
smiling brightly in reply.&#xD;
"Then the time is at hand when- we must part," said&#xD;
she, reaching out her hand and clasping Vashti's in a&#xD;
warm grasp: an action which for its true genuineness,&#xD;
as.well as its simple grace, was remembered by the two.&#xD;
others; such handsome girls, so strong, so vigorous, so&#xD;
brimming with vitality.&#xD;
"A pretty pair, aren't they," said Colombia admiringly.&#xD;
"Too lovely by far to make ,a surgeon and parson of&#xD;
to my mind," said the doctor. "Sheer cruelty to expose&#xD;
tender-hearted students to such attractions. How can&#xD;
they do lessons? you ought to consider."&#xD;
"I do; it is eleven o'clock: I consider it quite time for&#xD;
you to be off."&#xD;

died a convicted felon in one of their prisons? Will you&#xD;
join hands with his murderers? Look at them, smile on&#xD;
them, accept his death meekly at their hands, make your-&#xD;
selves one with them, living and dying ?"&#xD;
"We will brave all, Olytie; we can no longer endure&#xD;
this life. Bear with us, help us, won't you? " added&#xD;
Orchis, appalled by the stillness of her sister's face, and half&#xD;
frightened at her own temerity. "It is right ; there is no&#xD;
reason why we should not. We cannot help the past; we&#xD;
have suffered enough apart from all. We will struggle&#xD;
among the many, rather than fade out and wither here&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
"We are all determined, Clytie," said Tashti firmly;&#xD;
" we know there- is plenty of money ; we wait only for&#xD;
your consent, which we beg of you to give us."&#xD;
"That will I never do! If you will be fools, I cannot&#xD;
stay you. When your eyes are full of tears, and your hearts'&#xD;
of sorrow, I shall say,' It iÂ§ as I told you.' Go your ways &#xD;
reap what ye have sown !"           -&#xD;
"Oh, don't, Olytie !"'exclaimed Candace, throwing her-&#xD;
self at her sister's feet, bitterly weeping, " don't look so&#xD;
cold, so pale, so dead; 1 will stay, only let me love you."&#xD;
"What is love ? " asked Clytie, drawing out of her&#xD;
reach. "There is the money-chest ; I have no longer any&#xD;
part nor lot with you, sin'e I cannot live here in privacy,&#xD;
but must be subject to the intrusion of all idle people&#xD;
you choose 'to bring about you. I shall leave-you as soon&#xD;
as I can find a suitable place for my dead."&#xD;
&#xD;
"That shall you never do, Clytie!" exclaimed Vashti;&#xD;
"our father-is as much ours as yours; his grave is as&#xD;
precious to nes as you. We will not have the holy dust dis-&#xD;
turbed; we forbid it utterly!"&#xD;
- None present ever forgot Olytie as she stood where the&#xD;
slant rays of the setting sun glowed over her face, her&#xD;
soft, flossy, yellow hair ruffled out of smoothness by the&#xD;
shaker she had been wearing, her head turned aside from&#xD;
them so that her adorable profile cut clear in the rosy&#xD;
light like pale marble, and her set, hushed beauty so&#xD;
moveless while they were tossed and torn by emotion.&#xD;
When, after a moment's pause, she walked slowly away&#xD;
from them without a look among the group, they kept&#xD;
silence even while she passed through the garden with&#xD;
her flowers in her hand, and disappeared on her way to&#xD;
the grave under the wailing pines.&#xD;
They gathered closer together, catching each other's&#xD;
fingers, and speaking in whispers, and they sought com-&#xD;
fort .in eyes full of tears, holding fast to their strong&#xD;
purpose.&#xD;
Not one of them felt any anger at their sister, only&#xD;
truest, deepest pity; and "Poor Clytie!" was the last&#xD;
murmured word upon their lips as they exchanged&#xD;
"Good-nights."&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
GOODY RUDDOCKS BLESSING.&#xD;
S the decision was made, the leap taken, no time&#xD;
was wasted before carrying into effect the pro-&#xD;
posed changes. They all felt that their affairs&#xD;
ought for the present to be managed so as to startle and&#xD;
shock Clytie as little as possible,.an unspoken dread pos-&#xD;
sessing them that she might go away from them alto-&#xD;
gether; where or how none dared think. She showed no&#xD;
change of manner, nor seemed to observe their occupa-&#xD;
tions, scarcely their presence; continuing her daily round&#xD;
of employmeits, always silent, always apart ; once or&#xD;
twice, in meeting her, Candace fancied that her jetty&#xD;
brows contracted a little, and her dark eyes gathered&#xD;
blackness with the vivid glow beneath, which she had&#xD;
:felt the night when she had so thoughtlessly appropriated&#xD;
the azure crape ; but it might have been the child's ins&#xD;
ward sense of guilt and injury, for no allusion was-ever&#xD;
made to the scene in the hall, no question ever asked&#xD;
after the garments, which remained hidden in the old&#xD;
garret, where the trembling culprit had thrust them into,&#xD;
their box.&#xD;
With one accord the four young adventurers laid hold&#xD;
on Goody Ruddock, wfolloing her to a distant field,&#xD;
&#xD;
where she was busy among the brush she piled for burn-&#xD;
ing. Hanging on her, kissing her, clinging to her,&#xD;
while they let her know. the upturn in their road, the&#xD;
leap over the wall of the fold they were resolved to take;&#xD;
begging her help and the mother-love which had nursed&#xD;
their luxurious infancy and patiently wrought for them&#xD;
in their days of darkness.&#xD;
She wiped her eyes and hugged them every one.&#xD;
"I know'd it was a-coming, chicks," said she; " I seed it&#xD;
afar ; I felt it as the old bird feels her nestlings' wings&#xD;
a-growing under her. Don't 'ee flee so far away, sweetins,&#xD;
that my poor eyes cannot follow ye ; there's rest for ye&#xD;
all here, when ye're a-weary (patting her faithful breast),&#xD;
warm arms and a true heart when ye're a-cold."&#xD;
"Goody, Goody, you must not make us cry," said Can-&#xD;
dace, burying her tearful face in the old woman's skirts.&#xD;
"I'm half frightened already, and have a good mind to give&#xD;
up, lock the gate, and go on weeding flowers and driving&#xD;
cows till I am as old as the hills."&#xD;
"Nay, my sweetin, you can no more tarry in stillness&#xD;
when ye have learned the use of yer nimble feet to run in&#xD;
the same path with..other girls and boys, than yer chick-&#xD;
ens can be content in the coop. I'll niver make ye greet,&#xD;
not I; 'deed an' I'll give ye good speed at my best, and&#xD;
I'll keep all together for ye till ye need. Bonnie baby,&#xD;
winsome, wee chick, that I rocked the last of all ; go, go;&#xD;
and learn the things that other ladies know, and be happy&#xD;
too, for ye will; sic rare girls should have heaps of&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
Goody Ruddock worked harder than ever, and at-&#xD;
tended and watched over Clytie with dumb devotion, feel-&#xD;
ing the lone woman's loneliness, doubly lonely as the&#xD;
others took flight.&#xD;

&#xD;
Griselda took counsel with the Rev. Colombia, and&#xD;
through her good offices provided the children with&#xD;
plain, trim school-dresses and aprons. Through her aid,&#xD;
also, helped ~by Dr. Mattoon, who talked grimly of&#xD;
tumors, compound fractures, and amputations, trying the&#xD;
endurance of the embryo surgeon, Vashti decided on&#xD;
her college, and before the first. of December she was&#xD;
settled, and fully launched on her life-work. Last of all,&#xD;
Griselda removed to the parson's house, studying and&#xD;
laboring with unwearied diligence.&#xD;
So Orchis and Candace were left pretty much to 'them-&#xD;
selves, though Griselda went and came frequently, look-&#xD;
ing after them, and always full of sisterly kindness and&#xD;
good fidelities; and so, when the school-term opened, there&#xD;
was nothing in the way of commencement except their&#xD;
own dread of the undertaking.&#xD;

TEACHER PLUNKETT AND HIS PUPILS.&#xD;
HE first day of school was an ordeal for the young&#xD;
teacher as well as his scholars.&#xD;
When Precious Plunkett took leave of his&#xD;
mother at the door, she kissed him; and, looking him&#xD;
over with a careful eye, she said, using a formula she had&#xD;
inaugurated in his very tender years, when even his&#xD;
smallest needs were her hourly business:&#xD;
" Good-by, my dear boy. Is your hair brushed? ?are&#xD;
your teeth clean?$ have you got a handkerchief ? "&#xD;
"Jingo Peltus I mother, what do you take me for?$&#xD;
I'm not a boy any more. Look how you are lifting your&#xD;
eyes to find mine, and how I have to stoop to meet your&#xD;
lips. Good, little, tender, watchful mother, I'm  twenty&#xD;
years old, and a school-master."&#xD;
"Yes, my son, I do sometimes forget how you have&#xD;
grown out of your pleasant childhood. I am often&#xD;
tempted to weep for my boy lost."&#xD;
" I should say so, mother ; I remember the hearty laugh&#xD;
I had over the chair you so heedfully set for me, paring-&#xD;
bee night, under the hall-window, where I've crept in&#xD;
ever since I was a shaver, for fear I might fall and hurt&#xD;
my little -self. Look ,t my legs; are not they long:&#xD;
enough to step anywhere they want, without help?"&#xD;

2      TEACHER PL UNKJITT AND HIS PUPILS&#xD;
You are a well grown lad truly, my child," replied&#xD;
the small matron, laying her tender, motherly touch upon&#xD;
his strong, arm ; "aud with your budding honors so thick&#xD;
upon you, I hope you will cast away the bywords and&#xD;
boy-slang, or I am afraid your teacher's dignity will get&#xD;
a tumble."&#xD;
"jThat is as true as winking, mother. It will be an old&#xD;
sticker, but I'm going to sit down on them; squelch 'em ;&#xD;
brace up and waggle 'em. I shall talk only such things&#xD;
as belong to the pedagogue. Now listen : you are the&#xD;
school: First class, attention ! take your places ! toes out !&#xD;
thumbs to the seam of your pantaloons! (no, that won't&#xD;
do; I must leave that out; that's drill military). -Spell&#xD;
baker. There! how is that fot high?"&#xD;
"Fair, Precious, very fair; a little mixed in the orders.&#xD;
I only hope you won't some day give them the poser' you&#xD;
used to be so fond of projecting at me."&#xD;
"What, Nebuchadnezzar, the old trump?  I'll. just&#xD;
spell him once, mother, for the sake of the boy times I&#xD;
am turning my back on this morning :xTwo turfs and a&#xD;
clod, that spells Nebuchod;(a knife and a razor spells&#xD;

Jingo !-no, I won't say that, but it truly makes me sad to&#xD;
feel that the juice and fun of life is used up, and the rude&#xD;
tussle about to commence. When the fellows go out to&#xD;
slide, I must stop at my desk and write copies. I have no&#xD;
longer any part or portion in foot-ball or snow-forts ; L&#xD;
can't throw up my cap, and hurrah for our side; I can't&#xD;
play truant, nor tricks on the teacher; I can't throw&#xD;
paper-wads, nor write notes to the girls; -I must be digni-&#xD;
lied and look big. Good-by, little mother ; your boy is&#xD;
lost with a vengeance. -Oh ! by the way, you remember&#xD;
&#xD;
TEACHER PL UNEJSTT AND HIS PUPILS.     28&#xD;
I told you Orchis Dunwreath is fully determined to come&#xD;
to school ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Precious, I am glad of it. She must be a brave&#xD;
gixl; I respect her courage."&#xD;
"So do I. Won't you take some pains to make it easy&#xD;
for her?$ "&#xD;
"What can I do, Precious?"&#xD;
"Y o might invite her here some Saturday, perhaps;&#xD;
she knows almost nobody. You can't help liking her, she&#xD;
is so pretty and so sincere. I wish you would ; I never&#xD;
saw a girl so nice. The Blossoms made it very pleasant&#xD;
for her."&#xD;
Mrs. Plunkett looked at her boy while he talked, and&#xD;
she thought "Pom Blossom is not my Precious; they can&#xD;
afford it better than I. This darling is my all; I dare&#xD;
not help him to a' misstep in his first youth that may&#xD;
cause him to stumble forever afterwards."&#xD;
"I must think about that a little, dear," said she aloud ;&#xD;
"you know I never visit."&#xD;
Though there were no more words exchanged, Precious&#xD;
'felt that his mother drew impulsively away from the&#xD;
proposition, and that something Orchis had said to him&#xD;
was true:&#xD;
"I must bear it as well as I can, the ban which rests&#xD;
on us. There is no sin; but I think people refuse-to dis-&#xD;
tinguish. I shall try to forget everything except my aims,&#xD;
and the steps I must take to reach them."&#xD;
They were rough boys, some of them, who assembled&#xD;
in the school-room ; not a few nearly as large as the young&#xD;
teacher, and many old playmates of long since ; and the&#xD;
girls also had been punished, in short frocks and panta-&#xD;
lettes, by being made to sit beside him. It was really an&#xD;
embarrassing position to walk into, and Precious. was&#xD;

234   TEACHER PLUNTYKETT AND HIS PZ8I.S&#xD;
obliged to pluck up all his manhood to deport hhiself&#xD;
properly. He made them a little speech something after&#xD;
this fashion:&#xD;
"Well, here we are, scholars! all ready to begin our&#xD;
winter's work. I don't pretend to know everything, but&#xD;
what I do know I am sure of, and .I am not afraid to .tell&#xD;
it; and if you all take hold with a will, I can make the&#xD;
season profitable and pleasant. I mean to do it."&#xD;
Here arose a little scraping of throats and scuffling of&#xD;
feet among the boys in the corner, led by Alben Wraigg,&#xD;
and William Wimble; I expect his little mother might&#xD;
have felt nervous to hear it, as portending danger and&#xD;
trouble for her son. Precious paused and looked stead-&#xD;
ily at the group. "Yes,.I mean to do it," he went on;&#xD;
"but if you want a row first, I'm ready for you: there's&#xD;
half a dozen here whom I settled long ago in a square&#xD;
scuffle, and I haven't forgotten the trick of my fists nor&#xD;
lost the use of my feet in a back trip. I'm not quite&#xD;
twenty years old, but I mean to have just as good a school&#xD;
as if I was a hundred."&#xD;
Orchis and Candace, Augusta Blossom, and Blush&#xD;
Beach were punctual to the minute, and when the teacher&#xD;
finished his oration, Blush led the applause, helped by&#xD;
honest, fresh-faced Pom  Blossom, Abel Rose, and Tip&#xD;
Crowfoot, and the huddle of roughs in the corner&#xD;
measured them, and- concluded to keep the peace for the&#xD;
present. Mr. Plunkett bowed his thanks, and requested&#xD;
all, to select places to their liking; and when selected, to&#xD;
keep them during the term.&#xD;
Augusta and Candace sat together in one of the double&#xD;
seats.' Blush of course chose the one opposite on the boy's&#xD;
side, and Orchis sat behind them. When Mr. Plunkett&#xD;
came down with his pencil and paper, making a list of&#xD;
&#xD;
TEACHER PLUNKETT AND HIS PI1'iA&#xD;
&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
studies each desired to pursue with a view to classification;&#xD;
Augusta felt obliged to repress the fun which wanted to&#xD;
bubble out, and she and Candace replied quietly and&#xD;
decorously, which was a pretty good promise for" the&#xD;
future; they felt that the teacher had assumed toward&#xD;
them the attitude he meant to hold, and they did no: ven-&#xD;
ture to entrench upon it. Orchis replied simply," I want&#xD;
to learn all which will fit me to teach."&#xD;
"Mr. Dignity!" whispered Augusta, as soon as he had&#xD;
passed, "don't he put on high and mighty ! but it won't&#xD;
hinder my having some fun and playing tricks.; I can't&#xD;
live if I don't."&#xD;
"You will not plague him, will you.?" asked Candace.&#xD;
"Not bad; but we must have a frolic once in a while.&#xD;
He used to like pranks as well as me a year ago, and he&#xD;
needn't for a minute suppose we can afford to play sober=&#xD;
cheeks just because he has slipped into that arm-chair."&#xD;
Mr. Plunkett was so zealous and earnest, that he car-&#xD;
ried his scholars along by force of magnetism; he could&#xD;
laugh too, when subjects of mirth presented themselves.&#xD;
The regulation tricks were played upon him; as for in-&#xD;
stance: one morning when he attempted to sit on his re-&#xD;
volving-chair he landed on the floor, the leg being sawed&#xD;
in two. But little enjoyment was got from the exploit;&#xD;
however, because Teacher Plunkett arose, coolly brushed&#xD;
his clothes, and remarked, "A very old trick, boys ; I used&#xD;
it up myself years ago."  Again the school were nearly&#xD;
suffocated by red pepper burnt on the stove. The teacher&#xD;
remarked, "Your lungs are in as much danger as ours, so&#xD;
we will try and bear it together;." and in the afternoon he&#xD;
read them a selection from a medical book, upon the&#xD;
structure and delicate functions of the breathing-apparat-&#xD;
us, which interested them all, and the remaining parcel&#xD;

finding that they had enough of it.&#xD;
As our friends carried lunch, and stayed out the noon-&#xD;
ing, Candace was taught by Augusta to play cards, and&#xD;
was much fascinated by the game, which sometimes occu-&#xD;
pied her when she should have been busy with Smith's&#xD;
Geography; and out of this sprang an event in which&#xD;
Teacher Plunkett got so decidedly the best of them, that&#xD;
they could not forget it the whole winter.&#xD;
Having observed that the two were tardy several suc-&#xD;
cessive days after the call of the recess-bell, he carefully&#xD;
watched, and perceived that they brought no chilliness, no&#xD;
red fingers in with them, no short breath as from running.&#xD;
He asked no questions, but kept a quiet look-out, and one&#xD;
day he slipped from the room, and paid a visit to the&#xD;
dining-places and entrys, but no truants were to be seen ;&#xD;
yatttively listening, he seemed to hear voices in the loft,&#xD;
a great, unfinished garret, used as a play-room on stormy&#xD;
days. He ascended the stairs swiftly, and peeped through&#xD;
the crack of the door ajar. There, sure enough, were the&#xD;
naughty rogues, seated on a pile of shawls, playing cards,&#xD;
and so extremely interested in the game that they failed&#xD;
to hear the approach of the teacher, who paused a&#xD;
moment, laughing all over.'&#xD;
"High!" exclaimed Augusta, throwing down the card;&#xD;
Low !" added Miss Candace, dropping another; :" Jack!"&#xD;
exulted Augusta, showing the knave. Here masculine&#xD;
hands descended upon the shoulders of the culprits, and&#xD;
a deep voice said:&#xD;
"aAnd I've got the game !'"&#xD;
JuAhping to their feet in a mighty hurry, the blushing-&#xD;
girls found the quietly smiling teacher, who held open&#xD;
the door for their egress-.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Please pass before me, young ladies," said he, bow-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Augusta wished to rebel and disobey, and Candace ad-&#xD;
ministered a little push to her nose and looked saucy, but&#xD;
the young man stood waiting so confidently, he looked so&#xD;
tall, so certain of his authority, and so determined, that he&#xD;
did not seem at all the same fellow who snapped apple-&#xD;
seeds and made fun; and the upshot of it was, the game-&#xD;
sters return ed sheepishly to their duties, and Teacher&#xD;
Plunkett closed the school-room door, and sedately took&#xD;
his place upon his rostrum.&#xD;
Blush gu ssed, from the crimson cheeks of the sinners,&#xD;
that something: had transpired in which they had come&#xD;
off second-pest, and he kept reeling "shame " off his&#xD;
crossed fore ngers at intervals all the session. What it&#xD;
was he never discovered, for all parties kept the secret.&#xD;
Augusta replied to his question that Mr. Plunkett had told&#xD;
them to came downstairs, and they stared.&#xD;
Candace paid off the master -somewhat that very&#xD;
evening. As they started for home, they found them-&#xD;
selves under dropping clouds; and Precious, being the&#xD;
lucky possessorf a parapluie, stepped up to her as nearest&#xD;
to him, and said;&#xD;
" May I hold my umbrella over your hat, Miss Can-&#xD;
dace ?"&#xD;
"Oh, certainly, sir; just as long as you please," she&#xD;
replied, lifting it ,from her mat of brown curls, and ex-&#xD;
tending it at arm's length.&#xD;
Augusta also got a fling at him.&#xD;
"Have you made up your mind what character you&#xD;
will take in the tableaux next week, Precious," asked&#xD;
Blush.&#xD;
" He intends to chalk his head and go as a billiard-&#xD;

cue,'"said MissBlossom. "I wish to congratulate Mr.&#xD;
Plunkett upon the admirable choice."&#xD;
"Thank you, Gussey; if I took my cue from you I&#xD;
am afraid I might*lose my game," he replied good-iu-&#xD;
moredly.&#xD;
"Is that a joke, Candace, do you think ? " asked&#xD;
Augusta, getting ready her handkerchief. "If it is,&#xD;
it's like. your sum in decimals, where we failed to find&#xD;
the point. However, let's be kind to the young men, and&#xD;
laugh."&#xD;
Then commenced a series of aggravating titters,&#xD;
when the two hid their faces, and acted intense amuse-&#xD;
ment, which broke out about as often as they. looked at the&#xD;
teacher.&#xD;
"Pray, what are you staring at my ear for.?" asked&#xD;
Augusta, raising her face after one of these bursts.&#xD;
"-Nothing especial," replied Precious seriously. "I've&#xD;
been reading a curious book lately on progenitors; and&#xD;
I can't help noticing signs in people I happen to meet.&#xD;
'If in the rim of the ear, about one-third of the distance&#xD;
from the top, there is found an enlargement of the edge&#xD;
making an obtuse point turned inward, the person comes&#xD;
in a right line from the ape or monkey ; if the point&#xD;
shoots up, and is furnished with hairs bristling, seeming&#xD;
to say, 'Be careful how you speak to the animal in this&#xD;
cave,' you may hunt the person's antecedents in the fawn&#xD;
or the catamount.'"&#xD;
lhstinctively they all lifted their hands to their heads,&#xD;
feeling for the "obtuse point" and "bristling hairs."&#xD;
Reasnably satisfied with his standing at this point,&#xD;
Precious was willing to drop behind by the side of Orchis,&#xD;
whom he sheltered with the despised umbrella,' and to&#xD;
whom he talked in a low'tone all the way to her gate,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
uIUD BE  BUTTERFLY.&#xD;
HE Dorcas society was appointed, by special re-&#xD;
quest of the lady herself, at the house of Mrs. Ann&#xD;
Sacrider; .and as we propose to conduct our&#xD;
readers thither, we think it seemly, to describe a little&#xD;
the hoeiand her habits.&#xD;
A good many years, ago Mrs. Sacrider had been&#xD;
brought in state to Cherry BrookZ, fourth brid  of a&#xD;
wealthy widower. A pretty, simple, sillfycrai re, sin-&#xD;
pering, uttering inanities, playing "Bonaparte's March"&#xD;
and "Bounding Billows " on the piano, and singing in&#xD;
a thin, piping voice, "I'd be a butterfly" and "Metw&#xD;
by moonlight alone." In those days she had~ beautYful,&#xD;
long brown hair, of which she was very vain, and it had'&#xD;
been a standing joke to coax her to let it down or&#xD;
her shoulders; and on one occasion a rude young fellow,&#xD;
who ought to have known better, had tied her to a chair&#xD;
by her abundant locks: a liberty which she easily forgave,&#xD;
as it showed off so well her tresses.&#xD;
That was long ago; now she was an old, forsaken,&#xD;
faded thing, withered, untidy, left out of account, her hus-&#xD;
band dead, his property spent, and she living by herself&#xD;
in a little brown house close to the stub-tailed church,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7820-00000120"/>&#xD;
2A0       "I'D BE A BUTTEIFLY."&#xD;
&#xD;
living no one knew how. She cherished still the finery&#xD;
she had reveled in as a bride, and appeared in the bon-&#xD;
nets and collars of the last age; "Old Mother Sacrider,"&#xD;
she was called, derided by the young, looked askance at&#xD;
by the elders. A dreary ending to a blooming, pretty&#xD;
time, is it noti Pray God to keep us all from living,&#xD;
neglected and dying deserted.&#xD;
She gathered up all bits of newspaper which came in&#xD;
her way; she said she mostly got something worth keep-&#xD;
ing out of them. But Old Mother Sacrider's ideas of&#xD;
worth were peculiar to herself. She gathered likewise'&#xD;
her fuel from' the church pile. On one occasion the&#xD;
deacons made a raid on her cellar, and lo! it was piled&#xD;
with their faggots; and of a while she was found picking&#xD;
up apples or gathering potatoes from the fields of her&#xD;
neighbors, and she was mostly let to keep her gleanings&#xD;
(Young Harry Gill would have had a better time, you&#xD;
know, if he had permitted Goody Blanke to pick her fuel&#xD;
out of his hedges); she constantly attended evening&#xD;
meeting, and prayed in her long and set phrases: "May,&#xD;
we trust thee where we cannot trace thee !"  Aired&#xD;
views in the-Bible lesson in the spectacle-class, as it was&#xD;
sportively called, being made up of elderly females who&#xD;
were obliged artificially to aid their vision.&#xD;
Margery told Mr. Blossom they saw the truth through&#xD;
a glass, darkly, to which the farmer replied:&#xD;
"That depends, Miss Margery, upon whether they use&#xD;
the old-time calvinistic Scotch pebbles, or the improved&#xD;
new-school lenses."&#xD;
When the announcement was made of the Dorcas at&#xD;
Mother Sacrider's, a good many winks were exchanged&#xD;
among the members.&#xD;
Bhe had often before requested the favor, but had&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'D BE A. BUTTBRFLY."          241&#xD;
staved it off at the last moment, with the plea that she&#xD;
"hadn't got up the front-room stove yet, or she'd a&#xD;
leetle rather they'd wait till she'd made new sass;" but&#xD;
at last all obstacles seemed removed, and the society was&#xD;
actually appekted.&#xD;
I chanced co be in the shoe-store the morning of the&#xD;
important Thursday and while seeking vainly for a fit&#xD;
among the gaiters, I heard a voice at my elbow, which I&#xD;
knew at once,. expostulating with the good deacon, who&#xD;
keepsthe church funds and sells us our shoes. She was&#xD;
insisting that he did want a pair of chickens, and he pro-&#xD;
tested that lie did not, having at that very period of time&#xD;
a goodly multitude, eating hin out of corn in his barn,&#xD;
because, to oblige his customers and keep trade- lively,&#xD;
he had "taken in" their poultry instead of killing his&#xD;
own, and furthermore he expected.a "beef-critter" that&#xD;
very day, and couldn't use anymore "fresh."&#xD;
" But," persisted Mrs. Sacrider, while she fitted a'&#xD;
buskin upon her hand, peering at the stitches and&#xD;
plucking at the quarters, "'I .want some shoes, and I&#xD;
shall have to turn in chickens to pay. Members of the&#xD;
same church ought to be accommodating, 'specially dea-&#xD;
cons."&#xD;
It was a question of time; and as she held out longest,&#xD;
she did not go home unshod.&#xD;
After she was gone, Deacon Pillhackle looked at the&#xD;
fowls.&#xD;
" I declare to goodness! ". exclaimed he whimsically,&#xD;
"if the old case didn't get these hens out of my barn&#xD;
after all! Well, I won't say nothing about it: I should&#xD;
never hear the end on't. That was what was the mattcir&#xD;
among them last night; I thought it was a fox, and sure&#xD;
enough it was. She ought to be excommunicated.'&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7820-00000121"/>&#xD;
"1'Do BE. A BUTTERFLY"&#xD;
&#xD;
"A fowl proceeding, Deacon Pilihackle, truly!V" said&#xD;
The attendance' was fair, and from  many motives:&#xD;
curiosity brought some, pure' fun others, pure goodness a&#xD;
few; the Balquither sisters particularly made it an&#xD;
occasion of fetching eatables to the lone creature, and&#xD;
half a cheese, a pot'of butter went into her pantry, besides&#xD;
the biscuits and doughnuts for supper.&#xD;
The stove was not up in the front-room, and it was. a&#xD;
little chilly ; but by the aid of shawls and cosies we man-&#xD;
aged to keep tolerably comfortable.'&#xD;
Mrs. Sacrider occupied herself in looking over the&#xD;
work, declaring she was "too pesky beat out to sew one&#xD;
stitch."  She was in her best toilette: a yellow lace cap&#xD;
over her grizzly hair, and tied beneath her chin with&#xD;
dirty red strings; a faded dyed lavender silk with iu-&#xD;
mense gigot sleeves, one of her bridal gowns, rather&#xD;
frizzed and frayed on the bottom, and carrying in her&#xD;
wake divers small straws, chips, and other odd bits&#xD;
she had accreted in her twenty years of wearing, a smoky&#xD;
muslin! collar reaching to the shoulders, and a sash of&#xD;
yellow ribbon tied jauntily at the back.&#xD;
Effie McWhirter held in her lap a little reticule. of&#xD;
russet leather, bound with polished steel and furnished,&#xD;
with all pretty tries necessary to successful needle-work;&#xD;
and Mrs. Sacrider, after looking at it a second, reached&#xD;
over and took it from her lap, and commenced examin-&#xD;
ing'it and commenting upon the articles. She opened the&#xD;
needle-case; admired the gold eyes of the " John Eng-&#xD;
lish ' -inside,. selected a cuple, which she pinned to&#xD;
her lappets; next she took out the ivory-bandled scissors,&#xD;
with which: she clipped der nails, screwing her mouth&#xD;
into hideus' shape wjth every snip; and as she tlted&#xD;
&#xD;
"T' BE A BUTTERFLY"&#xD;
&#xD;
,243&#xD;
&#xD;
backward in her chair, rocking comfortabUly, one, of her&#xD;
new shoes caught her attention.&#xD;
"There! I declare: if that. careless deacon. hasn?t left&#xD;
out the top hole of my buskin!"     Immediately she&#xD;
crossed her legs in' a manner more convenient: to herself&#xD;
/ than agreeable to the beholder,. and, proceeded to wriggle&#xD;
a passage through the thick leather with the delicate&#xD;
points of Effie's scissors. Of course they both snapped&#xD;
short off.&#xD;
"Land !"  exclaimed Mrs.. Sacrider,   withdrawing&#xD;
and sharply eyeing their abreviated proportions;. "must&#xD;
be dreadful poor steel if they couldn't stand that little&#xD;
punch."'&#xD;
Effie's bloot became richer than usual, and she bit her&#xD;
lip. It is a secret, but I will tell you the especial cross&#xD;
it was to bear the spoiling of the handsome toy. The&#xD;
Baptist minister gave her the reticule! Yes, she had got&#xD;
that far. Old Miss Petingill said she was quite a mother&#xD;
to the lad.. the had' heard of it and all the rest of the&#xD;
spiteful comments upon her choice. But, Effie .Mc-&#xD;
Whirter had made up her mind to marry the young&#xD;
preacher, ten years her junior, and was immensely happy&#xD;
in her future of work and economy, as0 a poor parson's&#xD;
wife.&#xD;
After the paring-bee; Mr. Oxbow visited. Balquither&#xD;
again and' again, drawn to the. place' by its charm: of&#xD;
.busy thrift and hearty cheer. A home. where. everybody&#xD;
had something in especial to occupy and interest, a&#xD;
hobby to ride, a favorite interest to push. The chatty&#xD;
tea-table, surrounded with comely, healthy women, cov-&#xD;
ered with good palatable food of which all ate with&#xD;
appetite, where all talked at once, sometimes, it is true,&#xD;
where personal predilections were not spared, hard. hits&#xD;

being exchanged in good-haior. He liked the piled&#xD;
corn-cribs, full granaries, great pig-stys where portly&#xD;
porkers grunted in indolent fatness, the lowing kine,&#xD;
bleating sheep, the blustering hens.  He liked to tap&#xD;
the bee-hives, and listen to the angry hum of the dis-&#xD;
turbed honey-makers. He liked .especially, I think, to&#xD;
follow Miss Effie to her. flower-house, and talk about the&#xD;
blooms, and get a bouquet pinned to his coat by her&#xD;
hands; he liked to look at her while she did it; he liked&#xD;
to sing psalm-tunes from her "Carmina Sacra;" he liked&#xD;
to sit on the same sofa and talk. In short, Rev. Mr.&#xD;
Oxbow found out, before long, that he wanted to marry&#xD;
the blooming maid. He invited her to comb down to his&#xD;
chu rch, escorted her thither himself; and after they entered&#xD;
the aisle on his way to the pulpit, he said ;&#xD;
"Miss Eflie, I want a wife; I can never be a useful&#xD;
minister till I am married, out of the reach of gossip.&#xD;
I Want you; will you have me? Please answer at once,&#xD;
that I may settle my mind on my sermon. Say Yes."&#xD;
She said "Yes;" and as he' opened a pew-door, and&#xD;
handed her to a seat, he replied, "Thank you; now I can&#xD;
go to work with a will, secure in a good helper."&#xD;
Of course the service was not mu(.h but a blur to&#xD;
Eflie McWhirter, and her thoughts flew hither and thither&#xD;
in a confused whirl. After a little, the thought that she&#xD;
had gone and promised to marry a close-communion&#xD;
Baptist thrust itself disagreeably upon:her attention.&#xD;
But she raised her eyes to the man.; the bluest calvinist&#xD;
couldn't more have pleased her in stature and mien. After&#xD;
all, she needn't be dipped unless shieliked, and they had&#xD;
not to live on doctrines as a steady diet; and she could&#xD;
not find it in her heart to be sorry for the "Yes" she had.&#xD;
so unexpectedly uttergl.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'D BE A BUTTERFLY-"    24&#xD;
&#xD;
The sisters took it hard. The breaking up the band&#xD;
of maidens, the new interests sure to intrude, the new&#xD;
man about to be brought in, but above and over all, the&#xD;
hard shell; that was a dreadful affliction to bear. One&#xD;
after another they gave in; Effie's intended was so pleas-&#xD;
ant, and Effie was so fond of him, and so happy in him;&#xD;
and insensibly they began to appreciate his brotherhood,&#xD;
pet and[ scold, advise and mother the young fellow as they&#xD;
did Blush ; all but Miss Margery: she stood out and&#xD;
stood firm. It was. a trial and a grief to Effie, who wept&#xD;
some tears over the stoniness of her sister.&#xD;
" Don't mind," said Mr. Oxbow. "It will swing right&#xD;
soon." And it did.&#xD;
One day Miss Margery came unexpectedly upon the&#xD;
minister n company with Precious Plunkett, and she put&#xD;
out her hand to shake the good warm one of her neigh-&#xD;
bor, when Mr. Oxbow intercepted the American welcome,&#xD;
taking the white soft fingers in his own, and keeping fast&#xD;
hold of them.&#xD;
"Sister Margery," said he, "you give much to the&#xD;
church of your best ; give me the best of all: give me&#xD;
Eflie."&#xD;
She would not look at hiin at first, nor say a word, but&#xD;
she had to give in at last.&#xD;
" I suppose I must, as the silly child has set her heart&#xD;
on you; but I hate your stingy close-communion. I shall&#xD;
quarrel with you till you renounce it. You will have to;&#xD;
you will be thankful to; we will be six to one, and are&#xD;
able to talk you blind."&#xD;
As Margery  knew no half measures, once she opened&#xD;
her heart she welcomed the new pet in, and made lin a&#xD;
home. And now the Balquither sisters were in the thick&#xD;
of joyous preparations for an old-fashioned wedding.- So&#xD;

you see Effie did i obly to keep her-temper over 'the rape&#xD;
of the reticule.&#xD;
Our gyng folksfound out the new happiness pretty&#xD;
soon after it was setled. They were walking home from-&#xD;
school one night, when a man, driving a good pair of&#xD;
horses in a light pleasure-wagon, stopped and asked the&#xD;
girls 'to:ride.&#xD;
"We have only to go to that 'brown house yonder,"&#xD;
said Candace. a&#xD;
acWell, jump up.; im going right a-past there, and I'll&#xD;
drop you at the door."&#xD;
so they climbed up, and the driver looked thought-&#xD;
fully and rather admiringly at them ; Candace in particu-&#xD;
lar, who was -fall of laugh and fun.&#xD;
"IDo you belong to that house yonder?" asked he&#xD;
presently.&#xD;
"Yes.; or it :belongs to us."&#xD;
" Well, I am beat, that's a fact. They :call you the&#xD;
oughtyou were some gray-beaded, wrin--&#xD;
old maids. I thought  ugra&#xD;
kled creatures, and there you are as plump and merry as&#xD;
kittens. Queer, an'tit"&#xD;
"cWe are not responsible for other folks' ill-natuie,'&#xD;
said Orchis.&#xD;
"That's so; well, I'm glad I seen you, that's ia fact.&#xD;

McWhirters. There'll he one less old maid in that house&#xD;
afore long. Them's a pair of lovyers, lif ever I seen one&#xD;

It was Effie and. Mr. Oxbow, walking along the-road-&#xD;
side; and assoon as Augusta discovered them she asked&#xD;
to beset down. Bidding the sociable teamster Good-&#xD;

"tI'D BE A  BUTTTERFL F.124&#xD;
&#xD;
by," they all descended, and Augusta rushed up to the&#xD;
couple and related the man's observations.&#xD;
The minister was holding the hand of his betrothed,&#xD;
and he did not let it go. " We are lovers, Miss Augusta,"&#xD;
said he; "you may wish us joy."&#xD;
Orchis stood a little apart, with an astonished face,&#xD;
keeping her eyes fixed upon Effie, as if trying to read a&#xD;
riddle.&#xD;
"What are you puzzling over, Orchis?" asked Effile,&#xD;
going over and putting an arm aroundher waist.&#xD;
"I cannot understand it; how came you to change&#xD;
your mind? You told me you were satisfied with your life,&#xD;
and did not mean to marry."&#xD;
"I was not satisfied with mine, Miss Orchis," :said Mr.&#xD;
Oxbow, smilingly coming to Effie's aid, "and Effie has&#xD;
undertaken to manage it so that I shall be."&#xD;
Pretty soon Blush and Precious came racing up the&#xD;
road, trying-their mettle, and Augusta lost no time in tell-&#xD;
ing them the news.&#xD;
"It is not a secret any more, Aunt Effie, and I may&#xD;
talk about it. I congratulate you, sir; I am sure, noW&#xD;
that you are as good as paired, the women will leave you&#xD;
alone. You see I have heard how they pulled caps for&#xD;
you, and you can make the prayer a Seabright minister&#xD;
did after he got married':&#xD;

upon by old Miss Petingill asking advice about the Sun-&#xD;
day-school library:&#xD;
"We're thinking about a new book just' come out,&#xD;
Doctor- I understand it is an excellent volume, all about&#xD;
the Holy-land, called' Innocents abroad.' The murder of&#xD;
the innocents, I expect, or the destroying the first-born,&#xD;
or something. It's very good pious reading, and Pamela&#xD;
Groves has sent in 'Quits Works' aug Guy Fox's Mar-&#xD;
tyrs' from her pa's library.  Ie died last fall, over&#xD;
eighty and as spry as a cricket. You preached his oblo-&#xD;
quy, I believe; didn't you, doctor?"&#xD;
"I pronounced his funeral discourse, ma'am. Ile en-.&#xD;
tered the kingdom like a shock of corn fully ripe. le is&#xD;
an angel now."&#xD;
"Yes, I heard it ; a little more soothing to the&#xD;
mourners than the one you denounced upon poor little&#xD;
Spriggy Bateman, when you said there wasn't any testi-&#xD;
mony in the Bible that unbaptized  children went to&#xD;
heaven. Pretty cold comfort for his ma. I heard she&#xD;
cried herself sick fretting about it."&#xD;
"Warm -dmfort you mean, don't you?" put in Blush,&#xD;
who was passing the coffee.&#xD;
"Pert, an't he, doctor ?"said the spinster, enjoying the&#xD;
glower to which the divine treated the youth. "You&#xD;
hadn't ought to speak so to the minister, Blush," she&#xD;
added, pulling a queer face.&#xD;
"I didn't mean any harm, but I don't believe in the&#xD;
angel. Miss Petingill, I could easily fancy you one, yon&#xD;
know; but Mr. Groves, and such old customers,-I don't&#xD;
see it."&#xD;
"You youPg dog'skin!" replied the spinster, grinning,&#xD;
"if youei6s~4 veet at such an old creature as I am, I'll&#xD;
engageth id like you. I must tell you what Tomniy&#xD;

&#xD;
Goodbye said about his grandpa. you see, Doctor, they&#xD;
told him when the old gentleman died, that he was goin'&#xD;
to be an angel. 'Well, he's an old angel if he is,' spoke&#xD;
up Tommy, ' and they'll all know it by the puckers in his&#xD;
face the minute he gets in.' Wasn't that cute, Dr. Hard-&#xD;
bake?"&#xD;
"Very wrong indeed, ma'am! The child of a minister&#xD;
ought to know better; shows great want of proper in-&#xD;
struction."&#xD;
"Hold on till I tell you the rest on't. One day his ma&#xD;
was out, and little Tommy went up garret' to a trunk&#xD;
where she kept her nice things, and picked out a beauti-&#xD;
fal long purple feather and a lace shawl, and tucked 'em on&#xD;
and out he went, a-careering  up and down on his centi-&#xD;

out of the study and 'spied' him. 'Stop, stop ! Tommy,&#xD;
cried he, 'where did you get those things?'&#xD;
"'Ask the cook,' says Tommy, putting down the road&#xD;
like lightning. Well, at night his ma took himpupstairs,&#xD;
and began to talk to him. 'What made you answer your&#xD;
pa so, Tommy?$' says she.&#xD;
"'Because; ma, I was going so fast that I couldn't stop&#xD;
to think.'&#xD;
"'Now I must whip you, Tommy,' says his ma. ' Take&#xD;

you het me pray before you whip me?'&#xD;
"'.Certainly, my son,' says she, feeling quite glad that&#xD;
such a pious wish had arisen in her little boy's heart.  o&#xD;
he knelt down by the bed, and began to whisper to ilm-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
"'Now, Tommy !' says his ma, after she thou it he&#xD;
-must have said all the prayers he knew half a doze times&#xD;
over.&#xD;
"Notyet, ma ; I hain't near done. I want to pray a&#xD;

knees.till his mother began to see through-his trick, and&#xD;
get laughing, and he watching her all the while out of&#xD;
the tail of his eye. He knew when the right second had&#xD;
come a good deal better than you would, Doctor, and he&#xD;
jumped up:;;and flung his soft arns around -her neck, and&#xD;
said, as sweet as honey-:&#xD;
"'Kiss your :little boy, dear mother. Don't hurt me ; I&#xD;
will begood. I love yotr; don't you love Tommy;?'&#xD;
Yielding to such blandishments on the part of a&#xD;
parent is culpable weakness," said Dr. iardbake.&#xD;
"'Spare the rod and spoil the child.'"&#xD;
"Yes; you'd a liked the mischief out of him, I'll be&#xD;
bound. Iexpect the Lord knows why He didn't 'put any&#xD;
tender little bodies into your keeping,'though they do say&#xD;
you've got a furrin missionary, fetching' her up awful&#xD;
proper."&#xD;
" We :mean to do our:duty by Christiana, ma'am," re-&#xD;
plied the doctor.&#xD;
"My land ! if I don't feel sorry for young ones that&#xD;
has got to have duty done by 'em. I believe in my soul&#xD;
that's the reason ministers' and deacons' children :are' so&#xD;
likely to run a race with the devil. They get so much&#xD;

afterwards."&#xD;
"Doctor," said Miss Margery, coming upat this point,&#xD;
"did you read Mr. Oxbow's sermon on baptism which I&#xD;
sent you?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, I looked it over."&#xD;
"How did you like it'?"&#xD;
"All wind,! all wind, ma'am; no merit !:no merit what-&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
Effie's betrothed was one of the family now; and Mar-&#xD;
gery was far from  pleased either with the manner or&#xD;
matter of this reply. The best orthodoxy in the books&#xD;
couldn't excuse it. Dr. Ilardbake had made a mistake,&#xD;
as he found to his cost after a while.&#xD;
At the supper-table the ladies amused themselves with&#xD;
slyly picking out their belongings, borrowed for the ocea-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"My napkins," said Mrs. Blossom, "My .tea-spoons"&#xD;
said Mrs. Crowfoot; and so on till most of the articles&#xD;
were recognized.&#xD;
" We can afford to leave them to her," said Mrs. Plun-&#xD;
kett. "She needs them and we don't. I shall not take&#xD;
back my table-cloth."&#xD;
Precious took pains to bring Orchis near to his mother,&#xD;
and he looked on anxiously while the two talked. The ma-&#xD;
troni, scanning the unconscious girl from her standpoint&#xD;
as a possible wife for her boy, could not help being a trifle ..;&#xD;
stately and forbidding, and the young fellow felt very&#xD;
hot and uncomfortable. Orchis did not in the least share&#xD;
his annoyance; she met her censor clear-eyed and sedate,&#xD;
examining her, in fact ; comparing her mentally with the&#xD;
other matron she knew, and Mrs. Plunkett suffered'in the&#xD;
parallel. " Augusta Blossom bas a nicer mother than she'&#xD;

man had asked her opinion during their walk home, in&#xD;
which he was her companion, she would have told him&#xD;
plainly.&#xD;
Before the evening was finished, Mrs. Sacrider, being&#xD;
asked by some of the young people who liked to see her&#xD;
show offsat down to the little old tiny tinkling piano in the&#xD;
corner, and played " Bonaparte's March," and sang "Pd&#xD;
be a butterfly," in such a cracked, twittery voice, and with&#xD;
such youthful tossings, as were quite mournful to witness;&#xD;
too sorrowful for mirth, though some of the boys and&#xD;
girls did laugh: looking only at the absurdity she was,&#xD;
and not remembering her past, it seemed funny to them.&#xD;
To me it was only sad.. And they-left her, when the Dor--&#xD;
cas was over, a poor old faded woman, alone with her'&#xD;
pickings and stealings, and her little mincing airs. A&#xD;
good many' of them never saw her again ; but we are not&#xD;
ready for that yet.&#xD;

&#xD;
UNCLE ZOPIER's GOOD FORTUNE.&#xD;
NE night, not long after this, Uncle Zopher over-&#xD;
took them as they were returning home from&#xD;
school, and lie pulled in the colt to speak to&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Jest the werry olie I was wanting to find," said he;&#xD;
"I 'vas a-going up to Balquither after you, Blush."&#xD;
"Were you, Uncle Zopher? Well, I feel very proud of&#xD;
that."&#xD;
" You needn't speak so loud, Blush," remarked the old&#xD;
man; "I've been to an infirmity and got cured of my&#xD;
deafness."&#xD;
Looking him all over while he talked, Blush noticed a&#xD;
certain smartness in his manner as he pulled up his stock&#xD;
and held in his head, and also that he wore his Sunday&#xD;
clothes, and was well shaved and quite smirking and&#xD;
bright-eyed.&#xD;
"That's jolly news. How is Sister Polly ; did you kiss&#xD;
her since?&#xD;
"Maybe, and may be not; anyhow, I've come over to&#xD;
bid you to the wedding; she says she isn't afraid of break-&#xD;
ing a blood-vessel any more bawling at me, and she's&#xD;
concluded to have me."&#xD;

2=: UNCLE ZOPHER'S UOOD F          TUNE.&#xD;
Give us your hand, Uncle Zopher. Hurrah ! I am as&#xD;
glad as glady! What a bully old couple you will be."&#xD;
"gYes, Blush, I hope we shall get something out of the,&#xD;
last end of life worth having. I rather calculate on a few.&#xD;
good years before we turn up our noses and the tips of&#xD;
our toses to- the roots of the daisies. They're powerful-&#xD;
busy, Polly and Ann are, stoning raisins and. cooking&#xD;
thin's. We want you and the little old maid (don't get&#xD;
mad, Candace)-Polly's took a desput shine to you, I can&#xD;
tell you; she says the way you air cunning, when you rub&#xD;
up your nose and laugh,. is a caution."&#xD;
"We'll be there, Uncle Zopher, and will bring along&#xD;
the rest, of course."&#xD;
Whobe they? "&#xD;
" These : Orchis Dunwreath, and Precious Plunkett,&#xD;
and Augusta, and Porn. We will just fill a sleigh, and&#xD;
we'll have a bang-up time. For&#xD;
The elephant goes round, and the band begins to play,&#xD;
And the boys around the monkey's cage had better keep away."'&#xD;
While Blush was kicking up his'heels and singing his&#xD;
rhyme, Uncle Zopher said aside to Candace:&#xD;
"'You see, we concluded not to wait for water-million&#xD;
time after all, and will sing Balermy after supper."&#xD;
" When is it going to be ? I shall 'like it so-much. It&#xD;
was kind of Sister Polly to remember me; I want of all&#xD;
things to see somebody married. Do they jump over a&#xD;
b)roomnstick ?"&#xD;
"bNot as I knows on. I shan't flinch,'though, if they&#xD;
set me at it. It will be to-morry night at seving o'clock&#xD;
presacely," replied Uncle Zoplher impressively checking off&#xD;
the words on his -five fingers.&#xD;
"Now I must fTid the .jiner: we ain't great meetin'-&#xD;
folks, but we ain't wicked neither. I wish Goodbove was&#xD;

know how 'to do anything but growl. I don't take no stock&#xD;
whatever in old Hardbake-Dr. Blowhard, I call him."&#xD;
" Why don't you go for Effie's dipper ? " suggested&#xD;
Blush.&#xD;
" Who's he ?":asked Uncle Zopher, not posted in neigh-&#xD;
borhood news.&#xD;
"The young Baptist preacher who is engaged to Miss&#xD;
Effie McWhirter; he is a first-rate chap; and then Auit&#xD;
Effie can come along,:and that will be jolly!"&#xD;
"What.! one of the kind that .is going to live ina Kist,&#xD;
with the lid down, up yonder. I don't like that kind of&#xD;
doctrine, but I'd as lief give him my bushel of Maters, as&#xD;
another, if you say;he is able to tie a hard 'knot. Jump&#xD;
up, Blush, and come with me. I don't know where to go,&#xD;
and I feel kinder bashful."&#xD;
It was perfect sleighing, and as Precious drove a team&#xD;
of the Plunkett raising, they were both 'fleet and hand-&#xD;
some. Our young folks just filled a sleigh, the minister&#xD;
and his betrothed driving out by themselves in .a Bal-&#xD;
quithor cutter of ancient pattern, having:old foot-stoves,&#xD;
and old buffaloes for warmth and comfort; bnt the su-&#xD;
perbest kind of a-turnont could not have increased the en-&#xD;
joyment of the lovers.&#xD;
Six in a sleigh is close packing ; -but when 'did ever girl&#xD;
and boy friends mind that for a winter evening drive?&#xD;
Orchis sat up by Precious, who knew how to handle his&#xD;
horses, and had plenty -of talk for the party besides. I&#xD;
suppose 'there is scarcely a position where a nice-looking&#xD;
young fellow shows to so good .advantage in the eyes of&#xD;
a young girl, as when he manages successfully a pair of&#xD;
mettlesome 'horses.&#xD;
&#xD;

trCLE ZoPIIER'S GOOD FoRTUNE.&#xD;
Orehis sat with her face half turned toward her com-&#xD;
panion, thinking about him, admiring his strength, his&#xD;
erect, well-knit figure, the tall fur-cap on his head, the&#xD;
beaver gloves on his hands, his skill and care with the&#xD;
frisking animals, who wished. to shy and jump and&#xD;
prance, inspired by the clear frosty air, the gay voices be-&#xD;
hind them, and the chime of their tinkling bells.&#xD;
This was Orchis' first sleighing, at least since the far-&#xD;
off childhood, which was only a dream. Though the&#xD;
driver's head was often turned backward, replying to the&#xD;
sprightly banter of those behind him, it was not turned&#xD;
away from her, and she was too wrapt in the new pleas-&#xD;
ure to desire much speech.&#xD;
The first thing theydid, when they reached the queer&#xD;
old. house, was to lay out their gifts for the bride on a&#xD;
japanned tea-tray, which was an ornament-of the beaufet&#xD;
in the corner, and Candace presented them with a little&#xD;
speech; and I believe the surprise and pleasure of their&#xD;
reception was the pleasantest feature of the evening to&#xD;
the prim creature, who had scarcely ever had a present in&#xD;
her whole life.&#xD;
Precious gave her a finger-ring, Blush a - brooch,&#xD;
Augusta the chromo of pansies lying on an open volume of&#xD;
Shapespeare, which we all know and admire, especially&#xD;
the lovers of pretty Ophelia and her thought-flower. Each&#xD;
of the Baiquither sisters sent an offering. Margery, a copy&#xD;
of "Saints' Rest ;" Elevir, a dozen .fancy holders; Ara-&#xD;
belia, a pair of knitted shoes ; Gynet, a snuff-box of old&#xD;
Scotch make, curious and handsome; Effie, a pretty pin-&#xD;
cushion, with " Zopher " and '"Polly " pricked into it in&#xD;
bright-headed, pins; -and Candace and Orchis, baskets of&#xD;
the loveliest fresh flowers. They made-Goody-cut them so&#xD;
carefully as note to disturb Olytie; and never did roses&#xD;

&#xD;
and buds brighten a quainter house, thrust into jugs,&#xD;
smiling from old cut-bottles of a hundred years ago.&#xD;
It was a queer wedding of queer people, who joined&#xD;
hands after almost a life of friendship in company and&#xD;
yet apart.&#xD;
Sister Polly looked like Sister Polly; she could not&#xD;
loklike any other woman. The knot of hair at the&#xD;
back of her head was pulled into as small compass as ever,&#xD;
her gown was fifty years older than herself;-but her small&#xD;
eyes twinkled brightly, and she was as sharp with Uncle&#xD;
Zopher, as anxious about the "pawky cake," as if she&#xD;
had been only a second, instead of the lady of the even-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
The groom was attired in a swallow-tail reaching to the&#xD;
calves of his broomstick legs, and the brass buttons, sup-&#xD;
posed to rest at the waist behind, were under his shoulder-&#xD;
blades; his trousers were a trifle short, but his shoes shone&#xD;
like ebony, and his face was as cheery as-a well-kept rudtly&#xD;
winter apple in March.&#xD;
It was queer, too, the fresh bloom, and the fresh growth&#xD;
in the old smoked rooms. Granny Munson sat in a cor-&#xD;
ner decked in her best, moping and moving from  her&#xD;
gyrating chair, in which she had been brought bodily&#xD;
by David and Jonathan, to the danger of their hair and&#xD;
flesh, for she dabbed and grabbed at them all the way, as&#xD;
she did during the festivity, at- all strangers she could&#xD;
reach. Mark Munson, mean, sneaking, always wipinig&#xD;
his rheumy eyes, and seeking for something on the ground,&#xD;
was rather set at by Mrs. Sacrider, who had dropped in&#xD;
uninvited, and pitched on to the bachelor, mincing and&#xD;
speechifying.&#xD;
Augusta heard her say, "I wish you had a piano forty&#xD;

The tallow candles guttered and flared over the supper-&#xD;
table, on which were the five kinds of cakes which had&#xD;
kept Aunt Ann and the bride on the alert the whole week&#xD;
previous, and been anathematized as pawkyy " scores of&#xD;
times; -there was candy in tumblers and preserves in&#xD;
bowls; there were biscuits as. large as loaves of bread&#xD;
and coffee as black as mud. But all had a good time, es-&#xD;
pecially Mrs. Sacrider, who was attended by Mark Mun-&#xD;
son, and ate like forty 'thieves.&#xD;
"Look !" said Augusta, ":I believe that little old wretch&#xD;
is sweet on Mother Sacrider; see him wink when he looks&#xD;
at her ! What a pair of beauties they are'! It makes one&#xD;
sick- of ever getting spoony, doesn't it?  There goes the&#xD;
fifth lice of sweet loaf.;I left off counting the biscuits&#xD;
long ago."&#xD;
*" They would like 'living in the land of Cockaine, I&#xD;
think," said Mr. Oxbow, "where all the houses are roofed&#xD;
with cakes."&#xD;
"I believe they are making up-a plan for living in the&#xD;
same house. There is a-chance for another wedding-fee,&#xD;
but you won't get it,; she-is one of Mr. Iardbake's lambs.",&#xD;
"We must not selfishly desireto appropriate all good'&#xD;
gifts to ourselves, Miss Angissta; -'Let me live harm-&#xD;
lessly.'"&#xD;
Just then Mrs. Sacrider. pranced up, followed 'by Mark,&#xD;
who did not quite come into talking range, but stopped&#xD;
to :peer:at her and' the floor, as if uncertain where he&#xD;
'might find what he sought.&#xD;
"Old 'maids'll be skerce after a while, Effie, if this goes&#xD;
on, won't they?1"&#xD;
"      tPity the widders wasn't skercer," said Aunt Ann,&#xD;

"Perhaps they will be before long," replied Mrs. Sacri-&#xD;
der, smiling with a grimace, which was a horrible mem-&#xD;
ory and counterfeit of her youthful charms, at Mark Mun-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
"She's hooked a gudgeon, I do believe!" said Sister&#xD;
Polly, who was everywhere, hearing all the talk and&#xD;
amazingly enjoying the fun of the young people. "I&#xD;
couldn't wish her a worse wish than that she may get&#xD;
him. The-e ain't much abomination that that panky&#xD;
Mark don'tknow.: Maybe she thinks two can steal more'n&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"You do not -speak ill of matrimony, I hope, Sister&#xD;
Polly, do you?" asked Blush.&#xD;
"I hope I'm too .smart to call myself, a foul," replied&#xD;
she tartly.&#xD;
"That's right; we all mean to find our mates. We&#xD;
thank you for your good example,".remarked Precious,&#xD;
who observed that'the bride's sharp eyes wereaixed on him.&#xD;
"Do'you go to school in Cherry Brook?"sked she.&#xD;
"Oh no, 'Mrs. Patterly."&#xD;
"That's you, Polly," said Zopher, nudging his wife;&#xD;
"sounds good, don't it&#xD;
"Shut up! you pavky critter," remonstrated Sister'&#xD;
Polly; -"there's old Sacrider wriggling her head at you&#xD;
like an old blue racer. Don't make yourself a laughing-&#xD;
stock. for fools,;" but she grinned well-pleased, notwith-&#xD;
standing her rebuke. ."iow'd-ju say? " she added, turn-&#xD;
ing to Precious, while she rearranged the folds of her'&#xD;
handkerchief, which she carried; or wore, across her arm.&#xD;

"You look very thoughtfult," said he ; " upon what do&#xD;

" I studied yesterday about Egyptus, so&#xD;

"Do you hear that, Mr. Oxbow? Don't you wish you&#xD;
could have taken that wedding-fee?"&#xD;
"No, Miss Candace ; I want all my couples to turn out&#xD;
well."&#xD;
" Didn't those prosper?"&#xD;
"The poor husbands, all but one, were murdered by&#xD;
their wives before the marriage was twenty-four hours&#xD;

" Shocking ! So much for getting tied to cousins. What&#xD;

"I want you to come and sing Balermy, Candace;.I&#xD;
can't play my bass-viol any more, but I can sing like a&#xD;
bird ; and Aunt Ann has talked. so much theology with&#xD;
Deacon Bodds, that I feel as if everybody that wash't&#xD;
damned was a-goin' to be."&#xD;

consolation, because, if theycould be numbered, we might&#xD;

him.&#xD;
" You perceive the young man teaches manners," said&#xD;

eyes on him.&#xD;

"What, wondrous sounds are those we hear."&#xD;
"I suppose- that is 'Balermy,' but it reminds me of&#xD;
the title of a tract I read once, called 'Hoots in the wil-&#xD;
derness-of a lost soul."&#xD;
It was time to go home. They all took leave of the&#xD;
wedded pair: Sister Polly said she was "afeard they'd&#xD;
had a pawky time," but they all assured her they never&#xD;
had enjoyed an evening more.&#xD;
Mark appeared at the door with the colt in the old cut-&#xD;
ter, and gallantly-helped Mrs. Sacrider into it; she again&#xD;
lamented her inability to sing "I'd be a butterfly," and&#xD;
he was overheard to promise to tarry with her long&#xD;
enough for the musical feat to be accomplished.&#xD;
While we are on the topic, we may as well say that,&#xD;
three days after, Mr. Munson epused the widow, Hired&#xD;

Orchis sat by Precious on the driver's seat; he had&#xD;
been the life and soul of the party, almost outdoing Mr.&#xD;
Oxbow in fan and frolic, who kissed the bride and&#xD;
 frisked about in the most unclerical way.&#xD;
"Well, I hope my wedding will be as pleasant as this&#xD;
one," said Mr. Plunkett.&#xD;
"You won't wait so long, I dare say," suggested Blush.&#xD;
"Jingo peltus! no, I shall get a wife just as soon as I&#xD;
can keep one ;' wouldn't you, Orchis?"&#xD;
Orchis was looking pt him, wondering who she would&#xD;
be; and he turned and whispered, laughing, "I haven't&#xD;

first seen him, quite warmed her heart. She had felt&#xD;
fresh courage in the certainty that she had really gotten a&#xD;
friend.&#xD;

this one Orchis never dropped out of her recollection.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
MISCHIEF AMONG THE ROSES.&#xD;
ACH   morning Orchis fetched   a bunch of&#xD;
flowers to the teacher, and each evening she&#xD;
waited to walk and talk home with him. But&#xD;
Candace also waited for Blush, and Augusta and Porn&#xD;
were generally of the party. A wonderful world was&#xD;
widening for this single-minded girl, who thought straight&#xD;
on to her goal; and though she talked less than any of&#xD;
them, I suppose she more richly enjoyed the talk than&#xD;
all. Of course her daily offering was notided and com-&#xD;
mented upon, and Alben Wragg and Oynthia Redmond,&#xD;
and some others said some things which were 1ot proper&#xD;
things' to say; but Orchis, not knowing the t lkers (she&#xD;
was of the sort who cannot mingle with the many, are,&#xD;
never liked but by the few), studied and walked on in&#xD;
happy unconsciousness that they ever looked at or thought&#xD;
of her any more than she did of them; living her full-&#xD;
pulsed life; growing every day in knowledge and&#xD;
fruition..,.&#xD;
Candace fought some battles on the "old maid" stigma.&#xD;
For a while a huddle of children, coming from the mill,&#xD;
shouted after them, every time they met, the, hated&#xD;
epithet, to which they occasionally added' "Crazy Jane&#xD;
&#xD;
from Nigger Lane," by way of variety, pointing to her&#xD;
mat of curls, which any damp day set up in a spirited friz;&#xD;
and one morning they obstructed Orchis' way with their&#xD;
dirty forms, while they imparted to her this charm.g in-&#xD;
telligence : "You're awful humbly; you're awful humbly,&#xD;
soyou are;" which did not affect Orchis in the least; but&#xD;
caused Candace to lose all patience, and she turned and&#xD;
shook the foremost by the shoulders with all her might.&#xD;
"Don't you know any better than to insult a lady ?"&#xD;
After that her question was thrown back at her in chorus,&#xD;
till Blush took it up and thrashed the boys and threatened&#xD;
the girls, so that they no. more dared to open their&#xD;
mouths.&#xD;
As much to freshen himself in the language by&#xD;
practice, as to help them, Precious proposed giving Ger-&#xD;
man lessons to the scholars during the noonings. No one&#xD;
but Orchis wished to undertake the extra study, and so&#xD;
they two were left to themselves, while the rest strolled&#xD;
out, or fought forts, or went skating.&#xD;
"1 don't know much about Dutch," said Precious ;&#xD;
" but I can give you a start, Miss Orchis, and you can&#xD;
work on by yourself when once you are set on the track."&#xD;
Orchis was delighted, and lost not a .moment, scarcely&#xD;
taking time to eat her lunch. She made good progress,&#xD;
but unfortunately she drew to herself the attention of ill-&#xD;
natured scholars; and her studious ways, perfect lessons;&#xD;
and. good understanding with the teacher were salient&#xD;
points of attack. "Favoritism,'' that ready complaint of&#xD;
all lazy drones who don't want the trouble of working, was&#xD;
thrown at Precious, who meant to be just as just as&#xD;
Justice herself ; and the laggards winked, and pulled ugly&#xD;
faces over her" ten" reports.&#xD;
"Dreadful sameness about his remarks -!I'd put her&#xD;

down something else once in a while for variety," said&#xD;
William Brimble.&#xD;
"Oh yes; it is easy enough to see who is in hi good&#xD;
books," answered Cynthia. "I would try to keep it to&#xD;
myself a little, if I were he."&#xD;
Meanwhile the teacher and pupil went on their way,&#xD;
busy and happy, till one day she wanted a certain pen-&#xD;
knife he owned and had lent her occasionally; -so she&#xD;
undertook to try her skill at composition in the Teutonic.&#xD;
tongue. She commenced her note "Herr Plunkett,"&#xD;
finished it with much care and labored appeals to her die-&#xD;
tionary; and looking it over.with pardonable pride, she&#xD;
folded, addressed, and sent it up to the desk by a small&#xD;
girl who neighbored her.&#xD;
The teacher paused in his recitation, read the missive&#xD;
under the eyes of his class, smiled at the writer, and&#xD;
sent the article by a small boy; winks were exchanged,&#xD;
and sniffs behind books and big eyes were made, of&#xD;
"which the objects were oblivious.&#xD;
That night when the waste-basket was emptied,&#xD;
Cynthia Redmond, who had watched and seen the bit of&#xD;
paper thrown there, fished it out, and hastened away with&#xD;
it to a group of friends.&#xD;
"Look-a-here !" said she, "lere's a nice kettle of fish!&#xD;
Love-letters a-goin' between the little old maid and the&#xD;
teacher. I knew what it was when I seen him get it, and&#xD;
smile that way at her, so bare-faced, right before our own&#xD;
eyes. I suppose they thought nobody could see but them.&#xD;
I guess some folks are as wide awake as others. Dear&#xD;
Plunkett Well this is beautifulI!-fetching flowers every&#xD;
morning, courting all noon-time, and walking .home,&#xD;
together every night.. I'll tell father! so there!'&#xD;
Before long Precious began to hear side-remarks, and&#xD;
&#xD;
he saw grins on several faces when Orchis walked up of&#xD;
a morning to offer her posies; and he would have liked to&#xD;
ask her, for her own sake, to omit the attention, buts felt&#xD;
shy of alarming or troubling such honest delicacy as&#xD;
hers, and hoped she would herself find out somehow that&#xD;
the pretty flowers were provoking unseemly merriment at&#xD;
her expense. She looked very glad and happy, when,&#xD;
school over, the teacher came down to her desk and they&#xD;
began the Dutch lesson. Not accustomed to expend&#xD;
thoughts upon the attitude of her neighbors, she gave few&#xD;
to their appearance now; and if she observed at all the&#xD;
shrugs and glances, she set them to the usual account in&#xD;
her mind, the "ban" and the old maid," and turned her&#xD;
attention from them. She did not-wish to be disturbed&#xD;
in her duties or hindered in her progress by some human&#xD;
beings in whose lives she found no meaning.&#xD;
One morning Teacher Plunkett was surprised by a note&#xD;
from the committee, requesting, or ordering, him to their&#xD;
presence. He obeyed, wondering what might be in the&#xD;
wind, and testily resolved to make no change in his&#xD;
plans of instruction, whatever old granny notion they&#xD;
might have picked up.&#xD;
"If I were forty instead of twenty, they would not dare&#xD;
to thrust their advice upon me," he thought, as he looked&#xD;
around upon the solemn conclave.&#xD;
Mr. Redmond led the charges. "Young man, we are&#xD;
sorry to hear of your conduct. It must be stopped, or you&#xD;
must leave the school!"&#xD;
My conduct, Mr. Redmond!" replied Precious, turn-&#xD;
ing very red; "please explain yourself'&#xD;
I am going to explain; we sent for, you for that ex-&#xD;
press purpose.  You are charged with lightness, levity,'&#xD;

be attending to your teaching. I always said you weren't&#xD;
the one; set a boy in such a place, and what can you ex-&#xD;
pect?"&#xD;
"I don't know what you expect, Mr. Redmond; I know&#xD;
what you have had in my case: steady hard work every&#xD;
day since I took the position. If I had been as old as&#xD;
you are, I couldn't have drudged more than I have. The&#xD;
rest of your speech is Greek, which needs interpreting.&#xD;
I hope you know what you are driving at !"&#xD;
"You don't deny the old maid's fetching you flowers,&#xD;
I suppose put up so as to talk; nor her sending you love-&#xD;
letters beginning ' Dear Plunkett ' $-'&#xD;
"Love-letters ! I never got one in my life, in school or&#xD;
out of school, beginning Dear anything. As to the blos-&#xD;
soms, they are nobody's business; if a lady chooses to&#xD;
rifle her green-house to adorn our study-place, what are&#xD;
you going to do about it?"&#xD;
"Take care, sir ; best not be sassy to the trustees. My&#xD;
Cynthia seen the note with her own eyes ! Now what do&#xD;
you say?"&#xD;
"I should like to see it with my own eyes, that's all ;&#xD;
will Miss Cynthia so far-oblige me?"&#xD;
"I will obleege you, sir. I am very sorry to have to&#xD;
expose you before the committee, but duty is duty; we&#xD;
must not stop for neighbors or private feelings when we&#xD;
hold offices of public trust. There, young man ! you&#xD;
ought to blush and be ashamed of your conduct, instead&#xD;
of putting on such brass !"&#xD;
Ppor Orchis' German composition, in a fearfully&#xD;
cruhed state, was produced and handed around, and all&#xD;
shook their heads over it. The address was all they were&#xD;
able to understand, but that was enough; and one, after,&#xD;
another took up the words "Dear Pluukett" before the&#xD;
&#xD;
accused was permitted to get a sight of .it. When at last&#xD;
it travelled around to him he burst out laughing.&#xD;
" If the charming Cynthia had consented to be one of&#xD;
my class, instead of wasting her noonings on Alben&#xD;
Wragg, she might perhaps by this time have found out&#xD;
that '" Herr" is the Dutch for Mister, and the balance of&#xD;
this note, a request for a pen-knife, which one of my&#xD;
pupils wrote to test the value of her lessons, and which&#xD;
gave much pleasure to her teacher as a perfect exercise.&#xD;
Miss Cynthia will certainly come into the rank she is so&#xD;
fond of filing Orchis Dunwreath in, I am afraid, if she&#xD;
never gets any warmer love-letters than this one. I might&#xD;
go further, and add that unless she leaves off mischief-&#xD;
making, she stands a poor chance anyhow."&#xD;
"That is nothing to the case, young man; it is your&#xD;
voracity which is the matter now, not my daughter. It&#xD;
looks very much like 'dear,"' added Mr. Redmond, twist-&#xD;
ing the note up and down and peering at it. " I believe&#xD;
"Do you doubt my word?" thundered young hot-&#xD;
head. "I resign immediately. Get another teacher; I&#xD;
will have nothing more to do with you!"&#xD;
"What is all this?- What! what !" said Dr. Mattoon,&#xD;
seizing Precious by the arm as he was striding out. He&#xD;
had been too busy to come earlier, and had no idea of the&#xD;
business in hand.&#xD;
" I'm going to quit, that's all; I will not stand being&#xD;
called a liar by a- lot of ignoramuses who don't know B&#xD;
from a bull's foot."&#xD;
"Plunkett ! Plunkett! you are angry, my dear boy;&#xD;
just stop one moment, till I hear what this is all about !&#xD;
Resign? No indeed! I won't hear of such a thing. We&#xD;
never had such a school, and it must be a very pressing,&#xD;

reason, and a cogent one too, which shall force me to re-&#xD;
lease you from your engagement?"&#xD;
"I am accused of getting love-letters, Dr. Mattoon!"&#xD;
roared Precious, sticking out the bit of paper with a&#xD;
whimsical mixture of drollery and rage. "There is a&#xD;
specimen of them. When I tell them    plainly, word&#xD;
for word, what is written there, the fools won't believe&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Tut, tut! Plunkett, not fools! you don't mean fools;&#xD;
you mean trustees."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, trustees; and you can use my word or yours,&#xD;
just as you like ; mine covers the ground."&#xD;
Dr. Mattoon laughed heartily after reading the inno-&#xD;
cent scrawl. He laughed as much at the appearance of&#xD;
his favorite, whose hair stood all ways, whose broad shoul-&#xD;
ders were thrown back, and whose eyes glared at the&#xD;
board-it .was as well they were old men: young ones&#xD;
would have got their change on the spot-as at the ri-&#xD;
diculous mistake, and the solemnly puiturbed faces of his&#xD;
accusers, whose minds were much muddled on the ques-&#xD;
tion. ie made-haste to explain, and confirm Precious'&#xD;
statement ; but the teacher would not hear of going on;&#xD;
"No, he would resign straightway."&#xD;
"You shall not !" insisted the doctor. "Take a little&#xD;
time to consider; yon do not wish to leave a good work,&#xD;
so well begun, till you have finished it. You will not&#xD;
drop your first enterprise, abandon your first post, will&#xD;
you, my boy? You have not taken that view of the case,&#xD;
I see ; it is the true one. You can't help excusing the very&#xD;
natural error into which my brothers have fallen. It does&#xD;
look like dear to them. So push right on; let us enjoy&#xD;
your success, and bid you 'God-speed' in your next un-&#xD;
dertaking."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not with that lie thrown at me; they must take it.&#xD;
back, Dr. Mattoon!"&#xD;
"You are quite willing to set right your little mistake,&#xD;
of course," said the doctor, turning to the others.&#xD;
Mr. Redmond clutched his hat, and pulled it over his&#xD;
eyes with both hands. " It looked like 'dear,' didn't it&#xD;
now, Plunkett; you must allow that. I don't see any use&#xD;
in jargon that the dog can't understand."&#xD;
"Dogs can understand Dutch, if they are taught it,&#xD;
and so could you, sir."&#xD;
" Well, I wasn't; I ran my own farm at your age, and&#xD;
I done it like a book."&#xD;
"I move we drop it," said John Burce.  "Let the&#xD;
young man go ahead and keep our school; mistakes will&#xD;
happen sometimes in the best of families. I for one don't&#xD;
bear malice."&#xD;
. It ended in Teacher Plunkett's resuming his occupation&#xD;
the following Monday, but he felt injured and sore; and&#xD;
when Orchis went up to his desk as usual with her floral&#xD;
offering, Mr. Plunkett bowed coldly, while Cynthia Red-&#xD;
mond audibly tittered, and the teacher blushed before&#xD;
them all, and was very angry inside because he could no&#xD;
better command himself.&#xD;
"It is a pity to spoil so many of your roses for me,"&#xD;
said he. "I would advise you to let them bloom at home&#xD;
hereafter."&#xD;
" But I like best to bring them here, where you&#xD;
can enjoys them," she replied, laying them before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Really, I am not worth the trouble ; I don't care for&#xD;
nosegays."&#xD;
"Since when?$ " asked Orchis. "You always seemed&#xD;
to like them, and you said they were, sweet and lovely,&#xD;

andarnade a bright spot in the dull school-house. You&#xD;
said you would have a green-house attached to the build-&#xD;
ilg, and appoint me flower-girl, if you could do as you&#xD;
wished. You said the heliotropes were as blue as my&#xD;
eyes, the forget-me-nots meant that you should always re-&#xD;
member our pleasant noonings, and the rose-buds were&#xD;
as fresh as me."&#xD;
"I must have talked a lot of nonsense, then," he an-&#xD;
swered sheepishly. ." I thank you, I am sure;" and " I'll&#xD;
look out mighty sharp how I ever say any more such&#xD;
things, Jingo peltus!" he thought to himself.&#xD;
As Orchis still lingered by him, trying to make him&#xD;
out, he remarked rather shortly, "Excuse me, but I must&#xD;
ring the bell; time is up."&#xD;
Orchis returned slowly to her seat, and that whole&#xD;
morning she hardly took her eyes off the teacher. Every&#xD;
time he looked her way she was studying him; she made&#xD;
no concealment; she was perfectly open about it, just&#xD;
neglecting her tasks, leaning her chin in her hand, and&#xD;
conning him over.&#xD;
Poor Precious was constrained and out of poise under&#xD;
her scrutiny. Blundering in his classes, stammering in&#xD;
his explanations, knocking down ink-wells, throwing off&#xD;
books, and tripping his long legs under his revolving&#xD;
chair. As for the blossoms of discord, he just pitched&#xD;
them into the waste-basket out of hand.&#xD;
Precious was a noble, good fellow; he liked Orchis very&#xD;
much indeed, but he felt provoked and annoyed with her&#xD;
for making him ridiculous; and, man-like, he wreaked&#xD;
his annoyance on the innocent cause. He had too little&#xD;
experience and savoir faire to take a happy medium;&#xD;
and while intending to be easy and indifferent, he was&#xD;
gruff and ungracious.&#xD;

- When the session was over he approached hurriedly&#xD;
her desk.&#xD;
"I must be excused from the'German to-day," said he&#xD;
without looking at her. "I am going out on business."&#xD;
Stay a moment," said Orchis; "how have I offended&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
I am not'offended, Miss Dunwreath ; I am in haste."&#xD;
So I see," replied Orchis; "do not let me keep you."&#xD;
She looked after him till he- disappeared through the&#xD;
door. Then she sat still and thought of him.  how&#xD;
pleasant he had been at the paring-bee, at Sister Polly's,&#xD;
on the sleigh-ride, during the lessons, through the home-&#xD;
walks; how friendly, how kind. Then she arose and went&#xD;
to the desk to fetch away the poor blossoms; they were&#xD;
not there-oh yes, there they were in the waste-basket,&#xD;
wilted, withered. She picked them out quietly, and going&#xD;
forth on the beaten snow-path, she tossed them as far off&#xD;
as she could on the white crust of the field. As all the&#xD;
others had gone out and left her, it was rather a long,&#xD;
lonely hour; but it would have been that had the school-&#xD;
room been full of youth and bustle.&#xD;
The Natural History class, which came first hour&#xD;
in the afternoon session, was one of the most agreeable&#xD;
recitations in the whole day; and the other scholars fre-&#xD;
quently suspended their lessons to listen to the anecdotes&#xD;
and discussions among its members. Horses and dogs&#xD;
were the topic of the day, and an animated debate took&#xD;
place over their respective intelligence tnd fidelity.&#xD;
Porn Blossom told of a couple of setters who were very&#xD;
fond of playing together, but who would, upon occasion,&#xD;
show jealousy and other human weaknesses. As for in-&#xD;

he would, deliberately go. up, and snap and bite and quar-&#xD;
rel his friend out of the nest of comforts, and taking his&#xD;
place, would wag his tail and complacently offer his head&#xD;
for the pats he had envied the poor Billy. Also, how&#xD;
Billy, being taught to fetch his master's slippers, at first&#xD;
brought them one at a time, but before long contrived&#xD;
to pick both into his mouth, so as to save a journey to&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
"A wise dog," said the teacher; "but I as horseman&#xD;
must speak for equines, in the person of my mare Nan.&#xD;
You know what a beauty she is; high-bred, playful as a&#xD;
kitten, and- as proud as Lucifer. Last Saturday you re-&#xD;
member what a snow-storm we had. I took out Nan, and&#xD;
harnessed her to the plow, to clear the paths. She was so&#xD;
enraged and disgusted and mortified, that she threw her.&#xD;
self, and refused to rise for coaxing or scolding. I never&#xD;
strike her ; I hold a man who beats a horse as a poorer,&#xD;
meaner, brute than the beast he is misusing.  So as Nan&#xD;
would not obey me, I walked off and left her to think it&#xD;
over for herself, giving no attention to her, walking up&#xD;
and down, whistling, and using my shovel all around her.&#xD;
After a while, she lifted her head and looked at me ; then&#xD;
she called to me with an insinuating little whinny ; and&#xD;
as I was still indifferent, she sprang to her feet, shaking&#xD;
herself like a Newfoundland dog coming out of a brook,&#xD;
and stood still and waited ; then she set out on a keen&#xD;
run for me, and rubbed her nose on my hand and thrust'&#xD;
her face on my shoulder.&#xD;
Oh-! you are sorry for your nasty mulishness, are you,&#xD;
Nan,' said I. ' Well, then, come :prove it by doing your'&#xD;
work with a will. Jingo Peltus! " added Precious, bring-&#xD;
ing his fist down on the desk, "you never saw a mare&#xD;
so penitent in your life; I tell you she pulled like sixty;i&#xD;

and she only lacks speech to tell me how she loves me.&#xD;
I understand her, though, without words."&#xD;
Suddenly recollecting himself, Teacher Plunkett smiled,&#xD;
and looked a trifle confused, while he rubbed his stubbly&#xD;
hair all ways.&#xD;
"I am afraid I made use of an expression, in the hurry&#xD;
of my story, which was not quite pedagogish; but you&#xD;
boys have all heard it before, and won't be frightened;&#xD;
and I hope the ladies will forget it."&#xD;
" Orchis," said Augusta, nudging the attentive listener&#xD;
who sat next her, " do you hear that? ie will rule his&#xD;
wife as he does Nan. Poor fool, why didn't she stick to it,&#xD;
and get into the stable having her own way?"&#xD;
"He was both wise and kind," answered Orchis. "I&#xD;
like to hear him tell it. I wish he would talk more."&#xD;
"Of course you would say so. Now I am going to speak&#xD;
in meeting myself," replied Augusta, holding up her hand.&#xD;
"What is it, Miss Blossom ?" asked the teacher.&#xD;
"Could you let 'in a cat-smartness among your examn-&#xD;
ples?2 "&#xD;
"What do you say, scholars,-one, three, six hands,-yes&#xD;
I think we may ; go on, p ease.&#xD;
"My aunt gave me a favorite tabby, who is fond of&#xD;
music ; she always climbs on the piano while it is being&#xD;
played ; and whenever she is left alone in the room, she&#xD;
walks jigs, and marches, over the keys, of her own com-&#xD;
position; and whenever the band plays, she goes to the&#xD;
park and hears it out, never leaving before the finale."&#xD;
"What question will you ask, Blush?" said Precious,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"I would like to inquire what position tabby holds in&#xD;
the Thomas Orchestra," answered Blush soberly ; "and&#xD;
also say I have an excellent dog-story all ready."&#xD;

Oh, of course you are on the dog. side-of the argu-&#xD;
ment. Let the tale be true, please; you know our rule&#xD;
is to receive no fancy sketches among the illustrations of&#xD;
our subjects."&#xD;
"Do you mean that as a hint to Gussey ?"&#xD;
"My narrative was a cat-tale, that I saw with my&#xD;
own eyes," retorted Augusta.&#xD;
"Go on, Blush,"interrupted the teacher, laughing with&#xD;
the rest.&#xD;
"I stayed one summer with my father in the mining&#xD;
district, at the house of a rich man, who lived sumptu-&#xD;
ously. One morning a poor woman came across the moun-&#xD;
tain from the works, begging; a long, tiresome way, seven&#xD;
or eight miles; bringing in her arms a baby, and followed&#xD;
by a beautiful pure-blooded King Charles spaniel.&#xD;
"The compassionate lady of the house supplied her&#xD;
wants, and being a great lover of pets, she took much&#xD;
notice of the pretty, affectionate dog, feeding her warm&#xD;
milk and dainties; and while her humble mistress rested&#xD;
in the kitchen, she permitted the spaniel to curl herself&#xD;
for a nap in the lap of her handsome silken gown. Once&#xD;
in a while Piet would look around, rousing up, as if to&#xD;
make sure it was no dream, and drop her head again&#xD;
after a lick of the jewelled hand of her new friend.,&#xD;
When the beggar started on her -return, she had trouble&#xD;
to get Pret off, who followed only at the last moment,&#xD;
and with a most regretful, disconsolate air. Several weeks&#xD;
afterward, we were talking of the incident, when we heard&#xD;
a scratch and Whine at the door. I opened it, and there&#xD;
was Pret with a month old puppy in her mouth, which&#xD;
she laid at the feet of the lady, wagging her tail, arid&#xD;
watching how her offspring would be received. She waited&#xD;
long enough to.get a sip of milk, and satisfy herself that&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
he was welcome, and then she wasted away.     After&#xD;
a while she returned, bringing. aPdther puppy; she went&#xD;
and cane, till she assembled her entire family, 'to ac-&#xD;
complish which she made four journeys, of at least four-&#xD;
teen miles each; and she provided for them handsomely&#xD;
by her industry, for she and hers lived in luxury, the&#xD;
pampered pets of ladies, ever afterward."&#xD;
"There was a clear instance of reasoning, comparing,&#xD;
and deciding by evidence. The dog, being travelled,&#xD;
found out that quarters could be had better than she~had&#xD;
been born into, therefore she went for them."&#xD;
"bAlthough being to-day on the horse'side, I must testify&#xD;
to the wisdom of dogs. I like them; I believe in them,"&#xD;
said Precious.&#xD;
"You believe the fable we have just heard, also, per-&#xD;
haps," said Augusta, longing for a fling at Blush. "To&#xD;
me it sounds as if learned out of a book."&#xD;
"Permit me to acknowledge the compliment to my&#xD;
powers of narration," answered Blush, bowing; "you do&#xD;
me proud."&#xD;
" Mr. Beach vouches for its truth, therefore we know&#xD;
it," replied the teacher.. "His veracity is as perfect as&#xD;
the honesty of the Hydoiote merchants, who never keep&#xD;
accounts, never break their word or strengthen it by an&#xD;
oath."&#xD;
"What do you think, Miss Orchis'?" he added, as much&#xD;
to divert her attention from himself as for any improve-&#xD;
ment purpose.&#xD;
"I think cogs are very good friends to have; so are&#xD;
horses: they never hurt your feelings on purpose."&#xD;
As she did not change couneance -or attitude, the&#xD;
teacher felt that he had gained nothing by addressing her,&#xD;
and rather wished he had let her alone.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
GRISELDA WALKS BY THE. INNER LIGHT.&#xD;
RISELDA    DUN WREATH       had   been  busy&#xD;
every moment since ten o'clock the day before,&#xD;
and now it was almost five in the morning.&#xD;
Susan Brimble was down with the scarlet-fever, which&#xD;
was epidemic in Cherry Brook, and her twin sisters were&#xD;
still too ill of it to sit up more than an hour at a time.&#xD;
The distressed father had come, ringing the Reverend&#xD;
Colombia's door-bell, begging for help and nursing; and&#xD;
Griselda hastened immediately to the aid of the afflicted&#xD;
family.  She had swept, dusted, scrubbed' and scoured&#xD;
and washed dishes in the disorderly house, full of pesti-&#xD;
lence, confined odors, and all discoinforts. Griselda's&#xD;
conception of good nursing took in several points, you see,&#xD;
besides giving medicines, and she was' working out her&#xD;
ideas with a will.&#xD;
The weary mother, thankful for a let-up of the strain of&#xD;
anxiety and labor, rather collapsed after the first watchful&#xD;
half hour she spent in cognizing the helper's goings on,&#xD;
and crept away to the bed she had not touched for three&#xD;
days and nights before: and her deep breathing through&#xD;
the whole night, without a change of position, told how&#xD;
utterly fagged she was.&#xD;
&#xD;
GRISELDA WALKS BY THE INNER LIGHT. 2'f&#xD;
The young Universalist had sat out the dim, silent hours,&#xD;
broad awake, absorbed in her mission; omitting nothing;&#xD;
neglecting nothing ; alert to every necessity; supplying&#xD;
every lack; she held the small sufferer on her lap (not&#xD;
much but a bundle of bones now, poor thing), cooling her&#xD;
parched mouth with bits of ice, nourishing her with deli-&#xD;
cate broth of her own making, crooning snatches of cradle&#xD;
songs which came back to her memory as she saw her-&#xD;
self cuddled in Goody Ruddock's. strong arms, while the&#xD;
tired eyes drank up the tenderness which was poured into&#xD;
them, dwelling pleasantly upon her fresh beauty, till thy&#xD;
heavy lids.dropped at last in refreshing slumber, and Gri-&#xD;
selda ceased the swaying rockers, and rested quiet, gazing&#xD;
still upon the little, wan face.&#xD;
Queer thoughts of her own destiny thronged her mind;&#xD;
and as she studied the child, whom instinct taught her&#xD;
just. how to hush and comfort, she wondered if it was her&#xD;
doom to number all her days without motherhood; to&#xD;
foster aliens, but never to see her own baby lying on her&#xD;
arm; and she set her face grimly as she decided, in her&#xD;
reflections, that no such chance of home ties was hers;&#xD;
that she was elected to be anaoutside worker in families,&#xD;
an old maid to the end of the chapter.&#xD;
As she so settled her fate, a swift vision of the man she&#xD;
had first seen making tissue-paper caps, who had also&#xD;
hailed her "Soyez le bien venue ma sourr" and asked her&#xD;
to share his work, came before her. She acknowledged&#xD;
him a "proper fellow," full-pulsed, dew-chested, genuine,&#xD;
with graces enough to win regard, and' power enough to&#xD;
hold it, being won.  She had helped him often since.&#xD;
He was her friend, but though they met on the common&#xD;
ground of their labors, she felt that no love-throb had&#xD;
ever quickened his heart-beats for her; as indeed why&#xD;

shojid- there?  She had arranged her life, was striving&#xD;
for a goal. He knew it; he had discussed her plans, set-&#xD;
right, some mistakes, pointed our some flaws. lIe re-&#xD;
spected her as a fellow-builder, a good honest builder of&#xD;
earth's waste places. It was entirely as if they were sis-&#xD;
ters or brothers; oh yes, of course; that was the footing&#xD;
they were on.&#xD;
Now as the dawn approached, she stood at the window&#xD;
of the hushed dwelling, and looked out upon the starlit&#xD;
sky. No signs of daylight yet, and the whole village as&#xD;
silent as a city of the dead. Griselda fidgeted. Her vigil&#xD;
had been so long, her labors so exhausting, she felt the&#xD;
strain upon her powers without comprehending the cause ;&#xD;
she sighed, and a feeling of depression dropped upon her&#xD;
spirits like a leaden weight.&#xD;
"To what good?  . Why live only to work and die?"&#xD;
Yes, the ardent Universalist did feel this, though she&#xD;
had thrown the .powers of her mind and body into her&#xD;
occupations with the eagerness of'regained liberty, with&#xD;
a zeal impossible to any but a young girl, who has,&#xD;
after heartfelt longing, at last found a healthy outlet&#xD;
for her pent-up energies in the joy and glow of doing&#xD;
good.&#xD;
I think I may now go home," thought she, passing&#xD;
her hand wearily over her hot forehead. "-Every one,&#xD;
asleep; all at rest.  Thesepeople, who scarcely know&#xD;
my name, toilers among the race, bound up in their petty&#xD;
troubles, hedged pn by hard fortune, weighed to the&#xD;
ground under their heavy burdens, all emotions too dulled&#xD;
even to feel 'Thank you' for my pains, are recruiting for&#xD;
a continuation of the monotonous existence, drudge twelve&#xD;
hours, sleep twelve; and that is all, nothing ahead any&#xD;
better, no help for them or their children after them;-&#xD;

It was strange, but a cabinet picture of themselves at&#xD;
seventeen, which she and Vashti had turned up in the&#xD;
final arrangements to cut loose from the farm, arose be-&#xD;
fore her : beautiful, fresh, rosy. Youth at its brightest,&#xD;
and then the queer conjecture how she would look at fifty.&#xD;
How long this outside, old-maid mission life could last,&#xD;
and then what Dr. Mattoon might think or say, when,&#xD;
after a good deal more of this watching and fatigue, a&#xD;
good many thin, flavorless years, he would come upon her,&#xD;
faded, sallow, thin-locked, peaked, stooping.&#xD;
Unconsciously she straightened her lithe figure and&#xD;
threw back her head. "Not yet! not for a long time&#xD;
yet." Youth, vigor, health were all hers, all ahead of her&#xD;
still ; she was vexed at her thick-coming fancies, angry&#xD;
with her faltering on her chosen road, never discerning&#xD;
that the weary body was in fault for the dissatisfied&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
"Well, Griselda !" said she, half aloud, as she turned&#xD;
herself briskly about; "I had no idea you were such a&#xD;
faint-heart ; why, girl, your liver is white as milk;&#xD;
affrighted at a burden you have lifted of your own accord&#xD;
almost before you feel it heavy ! Do you think he snuiles&#xD;

ows where the bobolink sang till the golden sun disked&#xD;
out of Sight, and felt as fresh as at day-dawn.&#xD;
Having noiselessly completed her preparations, she de-&#xD;
scended the stairs; and shutting softly the street-door be-&#xD;
hind her, she stood alone in the deserted' thoroughfare.&#xD;
She walked quickly on with a light, firm step. The cool&#xD;
air revived her, and she experienced enough of anxiety&#xD;
for her unprotected state to quicken her pulses.&#xD;
She had trouble to get used to those lonely excursions,&#xD;
having for the last five years of her life scarcely seen the&#xD;
moon rise, much less the stars set.&#xD;
She was a little perturbed to hear a prompt footfall&#xD;
behind her as she turned Maple Street, and in an instant&#xD;
a rather loud voice, addressing her in accents which,&#xD;
though there was nothing pointedly objectionable in the&#xD;
words, annoyed and disturbed her, the tone not being&#xD;
such as a gentleman -would use in a drawing-room to his&#xD;
sister or his sweetheart.&#xD;
" Well! here we are, on our road to the depot, Miss,&#xD;
are we notI"&#xD;
"'The building lies straight before, you; you cannot&#xD;
miss it, if you step right on ; yonder are its lights."&#xD;
Before replying, Griselda drew up nervously the white&#xD;
muffler she wore on her head, pulling it across her lips,&#xD;
so that her voice came a little blurred through its zephyr&#xD;
folds, and she dropped her tone to adeeper key than be-&#xD;
longed to her in her hours of ease.&#xD;
"Are you going thither?"&#xD;
"c No."&#xD;
A stumble on a loose flag, and a hasty exclamation,&#xD;
"George ! I never in my life saw so ill-lighted a village&#xD;
as this Cherry Brook; did you? "&#xD;
-1 know very few villages, and I suppose when all the&#xD;
&#xD;
GRISELDA WALKS BY THE INNER LIGHT. 28g&#xD;
people are good enough, and mind their ways as they&#xD;
ought, they have inner light sufficient given them to&#xD;
guide them without need of gas"&#xD;
Griselda was astonished at er own quiet, not to say&#xD;
bravado, as well as the even pane she kept, neither quick-&#xD;
ening nor retarding, as with her last remark he stepped to&#xD;
her side.. Turning a hasty glance toward him, she could&#xD;
see only the outline of a man's form in an overcoat, and&#xD;
carrying in his hand a travelling-bag, and also that his&#xD;
face was turned toward her, probably -using his eyes at&#xD;
his best, as she used hers.&#xD;
"Ah, indeed! so we are all so good as to need no light.&#xD;
I am rejoiced to learn that; it speaks well for human&#xD;
progress."&#xD;
"I said nothing of strangers travelling through ; men&#xD;
who inquire their road; I included only the honest towns-&#xD;
people."&#xD;
"Would you consider me bold if I should ask you what&#xD;
brings you abroad at this untimely hour."&#xD;
"I do consider you bold to address me at all; but I&#xD;
have no occasionto refuse a civil answer, even at four&#xD;
o'clock in the morning. I have been watching with a sick&#xD;
child, and am returning home."&#xD;
"And your friends permitted you to return alone ! It.&#xD;
looks like scant thanks for such good service."&#xD;
" I do not work for thanks ; besides, neither they nor I&#xD;
calculated the chances of my meeting intrusive or inquisi-&#xD;
tive people, who make talk where silence would be both&#xD;
decorous and wise. There stands the station-house ;not the&#xD;
one which receives the friendless roghes, but 'tlae one&#xD;
which holds well-dressed travellers.l This way lies my&#xD;
road. I thank you for your- safe escort thus far. Good-&#xD;

~Stay one moment, till I beg pardon. for my imperti-&#xD;

"SOh, you meant to be rude, did you ? Well, take this bit&#xD;
of advice along with you. There is no woman above or&#xD;
below the courtesy of a true gentleman."&#xD;
"But you misapprehend me ; I spoke but as one com-&#xD;
rade speaks-to another. You take evil things for granted;&#xD;
you set me down among wretches, who am a good fellow,&#xD;
a very proper fellow.; go to. I have two coats; go to.&#xD;
Never mind that now. Lord! what an ass I have made&#xD;
of myself."&#xD;
"I quite agree with you; ambitious of Dogberry's&#xD;
distinction, you have achieved more than his success."&#xD;
As Griselda walked on, she listened for the footsteps of&#xD;
her quondam companion. She was not afraid of being&#xD;
followed, only curious to observe how long he would&#xD;
stand still where she had left him. It was but a second&#xD;
or so, and he hurried away. She reached herhome with-&#xD;
out meeting another soul.&#xD;
Just before going out for the day, after, her brief rest&#xD;
and hasty breakfast, she paid a visit to the Rev. Colombia&#xD;
in her study, and gave her an account of her adventure.&#xD;
T could not have done' it better myself, my dear&#xD;
Grisel!" was the minister's ecstatic comment. "I really&#xD;
feel sorry for the puppy to find himself made so exceed=&#xD;

by a non-voter ! a woman!"&#xD;
"Wait a bit," replied Griselda; "who do you suppose&#xD;
your puppy was?&#xD;
"Some drummer, some insurance striker, or other cos-&#xD;
mopolitan reprobate; making much of himself and little&#xD;
of other people. I know the stripe ; I despise the race."&#xD;
Griselda laughed merrily, but a little bitterly too.&#xD;

"You are much mistaken, dear preacher; it was our&#xD;

" Dr. Mattoon! Henny Penny ! Ducky -Daddles! The&#xD;

ply of the Reverend Columbia Johnson, as she dashed&#xD;
down her pen ; and going out with quick strides, slammed&#xD;
the door with absolute womanish emphasis.&#xD;
"Stop ! stop ! " called Griselda, running ' after her.&#xD;
"Not a word! not a sign ! Leave me to deal with your&#xD;
puppy myself. I will not have you meddle; you shall&#xD;
promise. This is my game; I will play it out to my&#xD;
liking."&#xD;
"Well,.I'll promise," replied Columbia sullenly ; "'tis&#xD;
a disgusting world : all the men are wretches, and all the&#xD;
women fools. I shall take to the woods and feed on&#xD;
roots.'&#xD;
"   'There speaks the natural carnal woman," said Gri-&#xD;
selda; "my pastor is fashioned like her sisters after all:&#xD;
she can feel disappointment in people and schemes, and&#xD;
rail as glibly as we. I shall thank my stars and take&#xD;
courage."&#xD;
"One's preaching and practice are not always on the&#xD;

MOST FRIENDSHIP 18 FEIGNING.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
&#xD;
MOST FRIENDSHIP IS FEIGNING.&#xD;
&#xD;
ROllS DUNWREATH brought no more flowers&#xD;
to school; and after waiting one more nooning&#xD;
for the German, and seeing that Precious put on&#xD;
his overcoat and went out as soon as the session was fin-&#xD;
ished, she hid away her books at the bottom of her desk,&#xD;
and never asked him another question concerning them.&#xD;
She was very unhappy; and though she did faithfully&#xD;
her tasks, and outwardly looked much the same, her life&#xD;
lacked the easy enjoyableness she had found when she&#xD;
had had a friend.&#xD;
About this time Mrs. Plunkett, having thought carefully&#xD;
over the favor her son had beggedof her, informed him&#xD;
one day that he might bring Miss Dunwreath home with&#xD;
him on Saturday, adding that she would make the invi-&#xD;
tation final and sufficient by a friendly note to the young&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
Much to her surprise, and a little to her relief, perhaps,&#xD;
she found that Precious no longer desired the visit ; and&#xD;
he was so short and uncommunicative about it, that she.&#xD;
concluded the liking had been only a passing fancy,&#xD;
which the closer intimacy of school associations had fin..e&#xD;
ished..; and she was rather wdrll-pleased and easy in her&#xD;
&#xD;
mind to have it so. Were there not many and many&#xD;
line girls from well-known families into which her boy&#xD;
would be gladly received? As she thus put Orchis from&#xD;
her thoughts, the image of the beautiful .young maiden&#xD;
rose before her : modest, strong, reticent, sensible;&#xD;
Orchis a wife ; Orchis a daughter; Orchis a mother_&#xD;
and she owned, with a half sigh, that she was of a truth&#xD;
a rare and radiant creature. But the family! their oddi-&#xD;
ties ; their antecedents ! Best asit is."&#xD;
Returning from school, the 'teacher still made one of&#xD;
their party often; and when he did he talked with Can-&#xD;
dace and Augusta. Orchis did not withdraw from him ;&#xD;
but as it was impossible for Precious to feel just as he&#xD;
did previous to his call before the committee, he did not&#xD;
know how to act the same; and whenever he- did ad-&#xD;
dress her, he did it as if he had got to, and wanted to get&#xD;
it over as soon as possible; and he joined in the jokes&#xD;
and frolic of the others, glad enough to get out of the&#xD;
teacher into the boy: running races, throwing snow-balls,&#xD;
rubbing cheeks, and so on'; and as Orehis seldom sported,&#xD;
never riotously, as did Augusta and Candace, who frisked&#xD;
as naturally as kittens, she soon fell into -a habit of drop-&#xD;
ping back of them and conning her lessons on the road.&#xD;
Mr. Plunkett watched her secretly, not over-pleased with&#xD;
her studiousness, and became livelier and more attentive&#xD;
to Candace than ever. Consequently Orchis ere long ar-&#xD;
rived at the bitter conclusion that her sister had gotten&#xD;
two friends, while she, Orchis, had no longer any. - She&#xD;
recalled the burst of love with which Candace had thrown&#xD;
her.-arms around her. neck 'in the old garret, that day&#xD;
when she came back from Sister Polly's and found her&#xD;
spinning, and how she had said, "I hope I shall never,&#xD;
never make you unhappy for a single minute."  She felt&#xD;

that Pet was making her unhappy ; and although she&#xD;
hated the conclusion, she was forced to believe that she&#xD;
did not care.&#xD;
She could not look in Precious' face without remem-&#xD;
bering how unkind he had been, and also how very kind&#xD;
he was able to be; and while she hid her grief over his&#xD;
changeable fickleness and selfish indifference, and her&#xD;
own intense disappointment in the friendship so brief-&#xD;
dropped so easily without reason or cause-which she had&#xD;
expected to get comfort and strength from for ever so&#xD;
many years, she buried her suffering so deep that it was&#xD;
below speech; she brooded, wondered, was miserable till&#xD;
her face got almost as white as Clytie's.&#xD;
Do you know how it feels, girls, after being the one&#xD;
only, to fall back to the one among many ; the little at-&#xD;
tentions which were all yours, the low-spoken words,&#xD;
kindly looks, deep interest, yours no longer, but lavished&#xD;
in your very presence on some sister or cousin, while you&#xD;
think and think in a corner? .And when you consider&#xD;
that Precious Plunkett was the only friend that Orchis&#xD;
had ever found; that he was the Ferdinand to her Mi-&#xD;
randa; you feel a little sorry for her, don't you? es-&#xD;
pecially as she made no moan over her trouble, asked no&#xD;
sympathy, offered no confidence, but tried her very best&#xD;
to look and feel as if her life was running smoothly.&#xD;
The German lessons had brought them    better ac-&#xD;
quainted in the few weeks of school than years of ordi-&#xD;
nary acquaintance could have done.  Their ambitions&#xD;
were so nearly allied, their hopes so much of a kind, that&#xD;
it was natural to talk them over, and very pleasant noon-&#xD;
ings they had passed ;"Mr. Plunket did not know how&#xD;
pleasant, till his annoyance had died away, and lie began&#xD;
to miss the satisfying companionship, the beauty he h1d&#xD;

&#xD;
been enjoying; and to tell the truth, the old desk looked&#xD;
bare without flowers; and now that he could get no more&#xD;
friendly looks from Orchis' truthful eyes, he began to see&#xD;
how perfectly lovely they were ; how admirable she was ;&#xD;
and he would gladly have restored the friendship to its&#xD;
old footing, but was not enough skilled in worldly courte-&#xD;
sies to know how to approach a girl who held herself so&#xD;
quietly aloof.&#xD;
In the meantime Orchis had found out something&#xD;
which intensified her bitterness, and widened the distance&#xD;
between them till it seemed impossible for them ever to&#xD;
mend the difference into union any more.&#xD;
Candace got hold of the love-letter story. It leaked&#xD;
out somehow, and Augusta Blossom brought it to her as&#xD;
a capital joke, over which she had laughed already till&#xD;
tears ran down her cheeks; and she was half frightened&#xD;
at the burst-of fiery indignation it awakened in her friend,&#xD;
but Miss Blossom did not know how much thicker blood&#xD;
is than water.&#xD;
"So this explains the sudden fall-off of his preference&#xD;
for Orchis; this accounts for his transfer of his attentions&#xD;
to us, and her devotion to her books. He found it neces-&#xD;
sa  to make her suffer, selfish fellow;JIhate him!t I&#xD;
did 't want any of his nonsense. I thought Orchis had&#xD;
q  rrelled with him,' and I have tried a dozen times to&#xD;
her about it, but she would not let me. Dear Orchis,&#xD;
it i too nasty mean ! so there ! and she is just as misera-&#xD;
ble as she can be ; I know she is."&#xD;
Candace did not say this out loud ; in fact, she ran off&#xD;
and left the laugher as soon as possible; and she lost no&#xD;
time in pouring the tale into her sister's ears with her&#xD;
own comments and protestations, and I believe a few&#xD;
tears, as she buried her face in her sister's neck.&#xD;

'9 And this is why Precious refused my flowers?"&#xD;
asked Orchis, holding her back, that she might see her&#xD;
troubled eyes; "this is why he broke off the German&#xD;
without giving me any reason, and turned so chilly to me,&#xD;
like the cold wind that blows out of the north? "&#xD;
"Yes, of course; he was nagged by the committee;&#xD;
laughed at by the scholars; and he had to do some-&#xD;
thing-   Don't look so, Orch! do storm, get mad,&#xD;
scold, as I did; fire up at him,-he deserves it,-and be&#xD;
friends again. It was so pleasant when you and he&#xD;
agreed; I liked to see you happy with him."&#xD;
"He had to do something: I was too troublesome; I&#xD;
made him ridiculous; he was obliged to be rough to make&#xD;
me understand. I was slow to take his hints. Friends&#xD;
with Precious Plunkett I Never again I He hay behaved&#xD;
meanly. Instead of coming to me, and saying,'Orchis,&#xD;
look ! your roses' are lovely; they smell sweet ; but I&#xD;
would rather you didn't bring them any more, for your&#xD;
owg sake, because these fools see in it something ridicu-&#xD;
lous and unseemly.'&#xD;
"Nonsense, Orchis! how could he do that?"&#xD;
" I could have done it for him; I would have spoken&#xD;
plainly, and have kept my friend, instead of frowning&#xD;
and growling, and giving no reason. No, Candace;&#xD;
Precious Plunkett can never be Orchis' friend any more.&#xD;
Kiss me, Pet. Do you remember what you said to me&#xD;
that night: 'I hope I shall never make you feel sorry' ?&#xD;
Well, you did hurt me ; for I thought he liked you and&#xD;
you were willing he should; 'willing I should be outside,&#xD;
alone ; that you did not care how I felt."&#xD;
"Mel darling Orchis ! my good sister ;-your little&#xD;
Pet ;-now you didn't, did you?"&#xD;
"Yes, I did. You see it was bitter cold out in the&#xD;
&#xD;
place where I was, while you had good times; no friend-&#xD;
ship, no love, no warmth anywhere, only indifference;&#xD;
and I got chilly,-and I will tell you, secret, Candace;&#xD;
I think I understand a little how poor Clytie feels, who&#xD;
can never love any more."&#xD;
"Poor Clytie!" echoed Candace; and they sat in the&#xD;
still gloom of the deepening twilight, with their arms&#xD;
around each other, their two soft cheeks pressed together,&#xD;
their tender thoughts mingling, and their true hearts&#xD;
beating into closer unison than ever. Orchis felt better;&#xD;
for after all, Candace's part in the trouble was bitterest&#xD;
to bear; with her honest and sweet, it was easier to endure&#xD;
the other.&#xD;

THE UHRISTiAS RVELS.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
THE CHRISTMAS REVELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
IE children's divertisement was ready, and the&#xD;
evening at hand. Griselda had seen much less&#xD;
of Dr. - toon than usual. He came and went&#xD;
at the parsonage, i parish work, attended the sick, con-&#xD;
sulted, reported, and accomplished much, as usual; but&#xD;
she had been out a good deal, or busy in her room or&#xD;
elsewhere.&#xD;
On the-few occasions of their meting, he had seemed&#xD;
disquieted, not at peace with himself in his ordinary&#xD;
bland, beneficent way. He made fewer efforts to draw&#xD;
Griselda into conversation, as of old, to tilt among errors,,&#xD;
hunt out truths, compare impressions, recognize. sympa-&#xD;
thies, and enlist in a common interest.&#xD;
The. Rev. Columbia had stood aside, always pleasant&#xD;
and friendly, but also somewhiles a trifle sarcastic ; hard&#xD;
on manly frailties rand shortcomings.; taking lower esti-&#xD;
mate of possible goodness, probable excellence; dwelling&#xD;
on the shady side of human nature, especially masculine&#xD;
nature ; delighting to report instances of graft, selfishness,&#xD;
uiworthiness in creation's lords, and laughing slyly with&#xD;
her pupil over the disturbed equilibrium of her coad-&#xD;
jutor.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Good enough for the puppy," said rhe; "let him&#xD;
smart well. I don't feel a bit sorry for the rascal; not L'"&#xD;
On this Christmas Eve, at the gala, both were busy&#xD;
among many, but busy with the responsibility of prime&#xD;
movers: hurrying up the costuming, directing the shifts&#xD;
of amusement, overseeing the whole; and as they were&#xD;
forced. into juxtaposition, into consultation, into united&#xD;
action, they could not help being friendly a little after&#xD;
the old familiar fashion.&#xD;
Where is the boatman's hat; or the hat of the boat-&#xD;
man, sar la bien venue ?" asked he- " will you make&#xD;
haste and fetch it                     l"&#xD;
"Yonder, under that pile of caps, I seem to discover&#xD;
the pride of the peacock, or a feather of his tail," replied&#xD;
she, pointing to a bronzed, burnished green tip flaunt-&#xD;
ing itself above its nelighborings.. As she flitted across&#xD;
the hall, and stooped, busily displacing the properties;&#xD;
he bent his eyes on her in vexed thought.&#xD;
"I will find out this very night !" muttered he.&#xD;
The first prank of the evening was the acting of" Lord&#xD;
Ullin's Daughter's," while Mattie Mattoon sang the&#xD;
ballad behind a screen and the actors produced its spirit&#xD;
in dumb show.&#xD;
The curtain rose on a tin bath-tub, in which was seated&#xD;
a boatman in extravagant Highland costume, who seemed&#xD;
to paddle his bark with a pair of brooms; a gale of wind,&#xD;
figured by four leather buzzes in the hands of as many&#xD;
boys, made it a work of art to manage the craft ;and his&#xD;
attention was vociferously claimed by a couple who ges-&#xD;
ticulated wildly.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Boatmar:&#xD;
&#xD;
"COlef:&#xD;
&#xD;
'Now who be ye would cross Lock Gyle,&#xD;
This dark and stormy water ?'&#xD;
Oh, I'm the chief of Ulva's Isle;&#xD;
And this, Lord Ullin's daughter."&#xD;

THE CHRISTMAS REBELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CHRISTMAS REVELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
An under-sized lad stood for chief, and the tallest girl&#xD;
in the hall acted the runaway lady. After prelimina-&#xD;
ries: were settled, the story told, the silver pound (weight&#xD;
covered with foil) offered and refused (" It is not for your&#xD;
killer bright,.but for your winsome lady "), the boatman&#xD;
makes room for them in the bath-tub, and the bride-elect&#xD;
sits down on the edge and pulls on a huge pair of rubber&#xD;
boots, then hands in her water-proof, carpet-bag, umbrella,&#xD;
bandbox and several bundles, and a volume of the&#xD;
"Lady's Book," after which she is gallantly helped to her"&#xD;
place by the little lover, and away go the brooms, swish,&#xD;
swash ! They are new, and they sweep well the supposed&#xD;
blackness of the raging water ; when lo ! down comes&#xD;
Lord Ullin, in a white wig, which he tears frantically,&#xD;
scattering powder far and wide.&#xD;
" His horsemen hard behind us ride."&#xD;
They did ride very hard indeed, and with deafening&#xD;
clatter, a couple of young fellows astride chairs, which&#xD;
they pounded about the stage, everywhere, anywhere, ex-&#xD;
cept on the boat before their eyes. Then came the thun-&#xD;
der and lightning "mingled with the hail" (beans shaken&#xD;
in a tin'basin, and whole bunches of matches fired at once).&#xD;
" One lovelyhand was stretched for aid,&#xD;
And one was round her lover."&#xD;
Waving an immense right paw encased in a huge buck-&#xD;
skin gauntlet, she clutched the defenceless youth with the&#xD;
left with such resolution and vigor that she half strangled&#xD;
hin, and then&#xD;
"The waters wild went o'er his child,&#xD;
And he was left lamenting."&#xD;
A red table-cloth was thrown over the boating-party, ex..&#xD;
&#xD;
tinguishing them entirely, and only Lord Ullin remained,&#xD;
who wrung the tears from his handkerchief, folded it&#xD;
carefully, put it in his pocket, and went off whistling.&#xD;
The curtain dropped, amidst tumultuous applause and&#xD;
hearty peals of enjoying laughter.&#xD;
"Well begun is half done ! "said Dr. Mattoon, mopping&#xD;
his hot face. " Nov for the operatic dramajor dramatic&#xD;
opera. Bring in your caps, ma scour la bien venue!"&#xD;
Griselda had a thoroughly good time that Christmas&#xD;
Eve ; she thought of it often afterwards as exceeding rich&#xD;
in pleasantness. She passed it all in Dr. Mattoon's com-&#xD;
pany. She helped, she laughed, she jested; as blithe as&#xD;
seventeen, as energetic and capable as thirty.&#xD;
She was tying on her hat in the little dressing-room&#xD;
after it was all over, when her partner stuck his head in-&#xD;
side the door.&#xD;
" CanI go, ma'am, if you please ?" asked he respect-&#xD;
fully.&#xD;
" Go? Of course, if your work is done."&#xD;
" May I be permitted to walk b the side of ma scour la&#xD;
bien venue to the. parsonage ?"&#xD;
"Certainly ! " she answered readily, "if you believe I&#xD;
am able to take care of you that far. "&#xD;
"You remember what the lion said when they showed&#xD;
him a picture where he was lying down with a man's foot&#xD;
on his neck  If Ihad painted the thing I could have&#xD;
had my foot on his neck.' As you are talking,, youca&#xD;
state the case to your liking."&#xD;
"I should be willing to leave it to an impartial jury,&#xD;
who is best able and most likely to keep a straight duty-&#xD;
path," replied Griselda quickly; and as he fixed his eyes&#xD;
quietly on her face, she added, " I mean mankind in gen-&#xD;
eral, not you in particular. Now I am ready to assume&#xD;

&#xD;
the responsibility you offer me. Let us depart and be at&#xD;
peace."&#xD;
" Would you mind prolonging your walk a little, Miss&#xD;
Griselda?" he asked, as stepping forth into the darkness.&#xD;
he tucked her hand in his arm with a "There you are !&#xD;
now see you stay put !," air.&#xD;
"Not in the least," replied she readily ; "it is.a relief&#xD;
to escape from the heat and din of the crowd. Well, I&#xD;
am glad it is over, and a success. My first Christmas Eve&#xD;
out is a good one to remember; I have enjoyed every&#xD;
minute of it."&#xD;
".You should, being the fruit of your own untiring ac-&#xD;
tivity and skill. You deserve the fruition."&#xD;
As they turned Maple Street, Griselda felt that her es-&#xD;
cort had brought her this way with a purpose ; and while&#xD;
she laughed inwardly, she roused all her faculties to be&#xD;
ready for whatever he might say.&#xD;
"I scarce ever saw so ill lighted a village as this-" he&#xD;
began.&#xD;
" Indeed Economy, perhaps, on the part of the gas&#xD;
company. It ought to be full moon, you know, were it&#xD;
not for the envious clouds," replied Griselda indiffer-&#xD;
ently..&#xD;
"Tell me, ma slur, do you still hold to your opinion&#xD;
that the inner light ought to make good people independ-&#xD;
ent of street-lamps ? "&#xD;
"Pray, when and where did you ever hear me produce&#xD;
any such dogma as that ? I am very far from a higher-life&#xD;
Christian as yet, I assure you; I stumble in darkness which&#xD;
may be felt."&#xD;
"II had a most curious adventure just about here once ;&#xD;
I've a great mind to tell it to you."&#xD;
"iDo by all- means. I am fond of adventures ; I revel&#xD;
&#xD;
THlE UJIRISTA.AS REVEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
in Don Quixote; ,I enjoy Roderick Random; I dote upon&#xD;
Sinbad the Sailor. Pray go on, Dr. Mattoon; I .am all&#xD;
attention."&#xD;
"Yes, thank you. I hesitate rather. You see I shall&#xD;
not shine in the story, and I could wish to. enlist your&#xD;
sympathy in advance. In fact, I made a fool of myself&#xD;
in this neighborhood not many short moons ago." The&#xD;
doctor pulled a whinisical face and sighed like a pair of&#xD;
bellows, as he made the confession.&#xD;
" You! the man of dignity, the pioneer of benevolence,&#xD;
the promoter of good works? Impossible! incredible !&#xD;
Pray explain. I am bewildered, overcome. In what sort&#xD;
did Dr. Mattoon undertake the role of street fool?"&#xD;
"Street fool! apposite ! excellent ! I accosted .a lady&#xD;
whom I overtook walking hereabouts, somewhere in the&#xD;
small hours, and I got preciously snubbed for my pains."&#xD;
"I am glad of it! 'When lovely manhood stoops to&#xD;
folly,' etc."&#xD;
"There's a cut for a poor fellow! Do you know, Miss&#xD;
Dunwreath, I could almost swear you were the fair un-&#xD;
known ?"&#xD;
"Swear not at all, sir, and be careful how you pay me&#xD;
back-handed compliments of that sort. First you accuse&#xD;
me of going abroad at unseasonable hours, then you imply&#xD;
that having been accosted, I have forgiven the accoster.&#xD;
Do me the credit to believe that I could never think pre-&#xD;
cisely so well of a man who would lower himself to such&#xD;
an action. I wish you a good evening, Dr. Mattoon."&#xD;
"Stay ! patient Griselda."&#xD;
A misnomer, sir ; I have no patience with Mr. Tabby&#xD;
Tolight."&#xD;
"Stay!d Miss Blanche All-but-white, till I tell yousome-&#xD;

"Janswer to no such name."&#xD;
"Well, then, Aunt Grizzle, listen to me a moment!"&#xD;
"Just as far out of your reckoning. Among our five&#xD;
old maids I am not likely to acquire nieces or nephews."&#xD;
"Couldn't you adopt a charge-mayn't I be your little&#xD;
boy?"&#xD;
"What! you, the agreeable Rattle who makes talk with&#xD;
strangers, asking impertinent questions of peaceable fe-&#xD;
males, who are modestly pursuing their duty-path, and&#xD;
ought to be protected by true gentlemen for the sake of&#xD;
their necessary work, if nothing else ! If I ever go out on&#xD;
a like errand I shall assume the garb of a nun. Men do&#xD;
respect that, at least in public."&#xD;
"True gentlemen respect women everywhere, Miss&#xD;
Dunwreath," replied he, with some dignity and much&#xD;
irritation; "I am a gentleman."&#xD;
"'Well! here we are on the way to the depot, are we not,&#xD;
miss $' (mimicking his tone and breaking into his brisk steps&#xD;
with firm heel-taps, swinging her shoulders and turning&#xD;
out her toes in his very manner).&#xD;
Dr. Mattoon laughed sheepishly. "It was you! I knew&#xD;
it all the way to Boston !. I gnashed my teeth over the&#xD;
knowledge. How did you feign your voice so as to mis-&#xD;
lead me?  "&#xD;
"I feigned nothing, sir. You misled yourself, because&#xD;
you desired to go astray. I assure you I very merrily re-&#xD;
call the sudden change in your demeanor, how quickly&#xD;
the agreeable Rattle subsided into the meek, proper, def-&#xD;
erential gentleman."&#xD;
"Now you do me wrong ; if I was a trifle brusque, it&#xD;
was but the tone of a traveller who salutes 'a comrade go-&#xD;
ing the same road. I lightened the tediousness of the&#xD;
way by converse. Christian the Pilgrim did the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
299&#xD;
&#xD;
I call myself a good fellow; I know I am one, despite&#xD;
your flings. But, patient Griselda, I need a wife to keep&#xD;
me in order; my late indiscretion convinces me of the&#xD;
patent fact; won't you-can't you-are you willing-are&#xD;
you able to undertake to keep me in order?"&#xD;
"I must reply to you in the words of the photographer&#xD;
whom the ugly sitter desired to produce of her a hand-&#xD;
some likeness: -' Madam,' said he,' I decline the chob!'&#xD;
No sir! I, mean to be a minister; I expect to lead a flock&#xD;
of sheep, not goats. I cannot afford to centre my cares&#xD;
on one individual, how much soever he may need them."&#xD;
" I don't ask that ; only minister to me first, and all such&#xD;
time and talent as you may have surplus you may do&#xD;
good.to the balance of the world."&#xD;
"I could not think of it. I know you would want me&#xD;
to abandon my profession. I can't; .I won't ! I am&#xD;
vowed to it, and I will keep my vow."&#xD;
" Griselda, listen to me, while I speak my mind seri-&#xD;
ously. I promise you never to interfere with your mission.&#xD;
I am willing you should preach, provided you don't preach&#xD;
to me. I shall be delighted to pay for the support of the&#xD;
gospel when my wife gets the salary ;-it is a good plan&#xD;
to make one hand wash the other. You see at once what a&#xD;
proper firm we may set up. You save souls, I heal bod-&#xD;
ies. Economy is on our side from the very outset. You,&#xD;
a minister, shall tie the knot and pocket the fees."&#xD;
"What ! give up my name ! No, Dr. Mattoon, I am de-&#xD;
termined to have 'Griselda Dunwreath' on my door-plate&#xD;
as long as I live."&#xD;
"Very well; let me put' Dr. Mattoon' beside it: neither&#xD;

"I can suppose many pleasant things which might be&#xD;

"Ought is not the word ; folks don't speak as they&#xD;
ought, but as they list. Everybody would call Dr. Mattoon&#xD;

Not everybody, Griselda. And if everybody outside&#xD;

things, it would not affect my equilibrium in the least,&#xD;
so Griselda be satisfied with her partnership. The world&#xD;
is not likely to be much to you and me, in any sense, ex-&#xD;
cept souls and bodies to work for. I never did pin any&#xD;
faith to outsiders, and I should certainly consult no one&#xD;

"I cannot see my way to any such compact, any such&#xD;
wind-up of my interests. I am afraid'you would be a&#xD;
hindrance; a burden; a care. I never expected. to tram-&#xD;
nel myself with a husband ; I didn't suppose I should have&#xD;

"Trammel! My dear girl, why should that be? I am&#xD;
already in the thick of my work; you have lined out yours.&#xD;
Now I ask you, could we not accomplish more with&#xD;
double interest and satisfaction if we pull in double har-&#xD;
ness; with a dear, sacred, precious home to come to, our&#xD;
own pleasant hearth to sit at, while we compare experi-&#xD;
ences, strengthen and advise each other ? Say Yes, Gris-&#xD;

",Take a little time, sceur la bien venue, only be sure&#xD;
that you think even, as much on my side as on yours. I&#xD;
can wait if I must, but I cannot be refused."&#xD;
"How'many girls got the offer before me?"&#xD;
"Not one. You are the first and the last ; if you&#xD;
won't have me, I'll wear the willow while I live. I won't&#xD;
stop working, but you will have the consolation of knowing&#xD;
that you have taken the flavor out of my labors ; that will&#xD;
be unpleasant to Griselda Dunwreath, I know."&#xD;
"I shall call you the 'Lively Rattle' if I do take you ?"&#xD;
"I do not care what you call me, so you promise not to&#xD;
interrupt our pleasant consultations by any 'unfriendli-&#xD;

"I'll have my name on the door-plate?"&#xD;
"In all the languages of the universe, so you write&#xD;
mine on your heart in living letters. Here we are at the&#xD;

could you 2"&#xD;
"Of course not. A minister ! you see how absurd it is !"&#xD;
"You will not be a shepherd in private life, you know,&#xD;

moment first, though. I am joyful, thankful that I have&#xD;
found a wife to my mind.. I'll be the best husband you&#xD;
ever had."&#xD;
Whimsical, queer, but very earnest was the doctor,&#xD;
as he kept the hand he held and took- the kiss he&#xD;
wanted.&#xD;
Griselda ran swiftly up the walk to the front door,&#xD;
then she turned and ran back again to the gate, where he&#xD;
was still standing looking after her.&#xD;
"Another kiss before you go ?" asked he, reaching&#xD;
after her.&#xD;
"No, no ; I want to ask you a question. How shall I&#xD;
ever, tell Colombia ? what will she say to me?$ "&#xD;
"Leave all that to me, that is my province: as your&#xD;
guardian, it is proper that I should ask her consent."&#xD;
Mounting slowly to her room, Griselda walked in a&#xD;
sort of trance ; such a double to her life had never&#xD;
seemed possible'; and she sat down gathering all memo-&#xD;
ries of this man who persisted in asking her to share his&#xD;
future.  And lo! they were all pleasante-ven to the&#xD;
encounter on the;street that early morning.  Perhaps&#xD;
that was not. disagreeable, because she felt that she had&#xD;
had decidedly the best of the gentleman there. "What&#xD;
will Vashti say ?" she mused; "what will the children&#xD;
think  .And I believe it is true that the embryo minister&#xD;
lived the prospect over in her thoughts very much as any&#xD;
:other maiden does, and allowed herself to be decidedly&#xD;
pleased with her approaching happiness.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;

BLUSH GETS UP A MENAGERIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
T was drawing on to the close of Teacher. Plun-&#xD;
kett's term, and compositions were now being&#xD;
prepared for the grand wind-up; and much.&#xD;
frowning, beating of celebrated tatoos, rubbing of fore-&#xD;
heads were expended for ideas which refused to fall into&#xD;
.rank.&#xD;
Just the Saturday before, I grieve to say, that Candace&#xD;
Dunwreath, Augusta Blossom, and Blush Beach got into&#xD;
a very serious trouble.&#xD;
The school-room needed cleaning, and the two girls&#xD;
secretly resolved to do the work and take the glory, and'&#xD;
say nothing about it. Therefore they left home quite&#xD;
early, and proceeded to the scene of action full of enthu-&#xD;
siasrm. bout half-way they were overtaken by Blush&#xD;
Beach, who naturally enough inquired whither they&#xD;
were bound. They pursed up their months, and refused&#xD;
to tell, making a great secret of the enterprise, being as&#xD;
sybilie as possible. So, after a short walk in their con-&#xD;
pany, Mr. Beach left them in a huff, turning off at the&#xD;
cross-road, and never once looking behind him.&#xD;
"Blush is mad and I am glad," said Augusta. ~" Let's&#xD;
hurry now and go to work."&#xD;

&#xD;
Cleaning meant only moving the benches and sweep-&#xD;
ing, when they undertook the job; but with the house-&#xD;
eeper spirit kindling within them, they resolved to go.&#xD;
further and wash the windows.&#xD;
"They need it bad enough," said Augusta; "the com-&#xD;
mittee talked of having them done when I was a little&#xD;
girl, but they hated to disturb the spiders."&#xD;
It was quite a labor to get them out; and after lifting&#xD;
all on one side of the long room, and laying the'ni in a pile&#xD;
on the floor, they paused to rest and count the sashes.&#xD;
Then they remembered that they had no soap, no towels,&#xD;
and nobody to bring water ; and they were half sorry&#xD;
that they had not let Blush into their project, quite will-&#xD;
ing he should share the honor, so he did the dirty work.,&#xD;
It was so delightfully exhilarating to be free to shout and&#xD;
scream in the school-house, generally pervaded by the&#xD;
spirit of restrained silence, that Candace burst out into&#xD;
hilarious song, in which she was joined by her compan-&#xD;
ion. As music and dancing are twin graces, it was al-&#xD;
most a necessity that the two should twirl about the room&#xD;
in gleeful measure; and a good time they had of it ;&#xD;
rather breathless, very rosy, but still not half merry&#xD;
enough to pause, when suddenly, without warning,&#xD;
bounce! "Bow-wow !"  came a huge black dog through&#xD;
the open window, then "St-st, permow!" a-couple of cats,&#xD;
with tails tremendous and backs astonishing; and the&#xD;
cats began to run, and the dogs began to chase them, and&#xD;
the girls began to squall; and clutching each other fran-&#xD;
tically, they collapsed in a frighted heap just where they&#xD;
happened to be when the invasion of the Goths and Van-&#xD;
dals broke out-or, in rather : unluckily they fell right&#xD;
atop of their pretty pile of sashes ; and such a noise as the&#xD;
broken glass made, crushing and clattering ! and a curly&#xD;
&#xD;
head appeared at the window, and Blush Beach goggled&#xD;
his bright eyes at the stirring climax of his nice bit of&#xD;
mischievous revenge.&#xD;
He quickly leaped in after his menagerie, and helped&#xD;
the fallen to rise again. Fortunately no serious hurts&#xD;
were suffered ; a few scratches, a terrible scare were all ;&#xD;
and as soon as they found voice, a shower of reproaches&#xD;
were launched at the unhappy lad, who got chased into&#xD;
corners, had his hair pulled and his ears boxed almost&#xD;
as much as he deserved. Then arose a great calm, and&#xD;
the three. stood about the wreck with sober faces. Every&#xD;
pane smashed !&#xD;
"Don't you mind, girls," said Blush cheerfully. "I'll&#xD;
get rid of the animals, and then I'll run down to Cherry&#xD;
Brook for a glazier. A good smart workman can put&#xD;
them all back by dark,Â°and we'll just sweep up the&#xD;
fragments, and there we are as good as new. Next time&#xD;
confide in me and save breakage."&#xD;
Wrapped in shawls they awaited his return. He came&#xD;
breathless : glazier out of town; shop shut ; crape on the&#xD;
door ; somebody dead. Blush had not finished his recital&#xD;
as " Murad the Unlucky," when who should drive past but&#xD;
Esquire Redmond, who paused to contemplate the open&#xD;
countenance of his trusteeship ; and he lost no time in&#xD;
inquiring the cause of the crash.&#xD;
"I've a great mind to tell him we've had a first-class&#xD;
panic, or an earthquake," whispered Blush. "What shall&#xD;
Isay?"&#xD;
"Tell the truth," replied Candace. ~" We took out the&#xD;
window to wash them, Esquire Redmond, and unfortu-&#xD;
nately they got broken."&#xD;
"I should say so; quite considerably broken. Heavy&#xD;
damage ,,you must pay for it, every penny."&#xD;

"A11 right, sir," answered Blush, glad to be let off so&#xD;
silly. " Great pity ; but if you will attend to the busi-&#xD;
ness I will foot the bill. How much will it be?$ " -.&#xD;
"Five dollars at the very least ; maybe more."&#xD;
" Make it six, sir, and I'll hand it in examination-&#xD;

"Six dollars, remember; not a penny less."&#xD;
"You are careful- about the pennies, ain't you, Es-&#xD;

" My lad, remember the old saying, ' Take care of the&#xD;
pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves.'"&#xD;
" I do, sir ; I will show you how exact I can be to the&#xD;
last copper cent."&#xD;
Esquire Redmond felt that. he had done a good thing&#xD;
for his district, and was besides much pleased with the&#xD;
chattiness of the boy, who followed him to the door and&#xD;
also accompanied him on his way. For the last hour&#xD;
there had been a light fall of snow, most untimely, which&#xD;
had covered the trees with a soft mantle, treacherous and&#xD;
hite.&#xD;
ning under a spreading pine, Blush reached up and&#xD;
placed his finger upon a protuberance in the bark.&#xD;
"Look here, Esquire, you know all about trees; what&#xD;
is this thing?"&#xD;
:Pleasedwith the compliment, the old gentleman&#xD;
pulled out his eye-glasses, adjusted. them, lifted his face&#xD;
to examine the curious object, when the impudent joker&#xD;
gave the slender trunk a smart kick, which sent the snow-&#xD;
flakes all over him, wrapping him like a sheeted ghost,&#xD;
while he himself sprang aside untouched.&#xD;
"You young rascal, wait till I catch you!" exclaimed&#xD;
the angry man, shaking himself, brushing the snow from&#xD;
Shis ears and whiskers. "A pretty trick indeed 1"&#xD;

The girls, who had seen the whole,1laughed and clapped&#xD;
their hands in the doorway. .Mr. Redmond was no favor,&#xD;
ite, being, as Augusta said, "too stingy-pious to be de-&#xD;

Blush had a little gi-udge to settle, w hich was this:.&#xD;
One day, in the autumn, he had gone nutting on Esquire&#xD;
Redmond's land ; and after a hard day's work he shoul-&#xD;
dered his full bag, and trudged off whistling, and thinking&#xD;
how he would give a frolic with his hickories and invite&#xD;
his friends. He had not cleared the field, when the&#xD;
owner overtook him, and made him yield up his booty,&#xD;
having watched and waited till the gathering was done,&#xD;
so as to get the whole.&#xD;
- "Much obliged for your trouble, boy," he had saj, as&#xD;
the lad most unwillingly surrendered his hard day's work.&#xD;
" The mouldy old hunks didn't even offer me a hand-&#xD;
ful to feed my black squirrel,".said Blush indignantly,&#xD;
when he told the tale, explaining the motive of his&#xD;
prank, after his victim had gone. "Walnuts and but-&#xD;
- ternuts that. grow in the woods belong to everybody, no&#xD;
matter whose land they grow on." (This was his boy's&#xD;
reasoning.) "I guess he'll find he's got pounds to take&#xD;
care of when I bring him his six dollars."&#xD;
"What do you mean, Blush ?"&#xD;
" Never mind; wait till examination-day; you'll see."&#xD;

WHAT If" LIGHTER THAN A PEA'HER?&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
WHAT IS LIGHTER THAN A FEATHERto&#xD;
&#xD;
RECIOUS PLUNKETT was heartily weary of&#xD;
his quarrel with Orchis,-if it could be called a&#xD;
quarrel, when no words were ever exchanged;&#xD;
and he would gladly have made up, if he had known&#xD;
how: But it seemed that his day of grace was past, or&#xD;
at any rate he lost his lai'rchance by a fit of smartness&#xD;
he played off, perhaps out of pique, perhaps to find out if&#xD;
he could not provoke her into speaking to him.&#xD;
Orchis handed in; as required, her examination essay,&#xD;
upon which she had expended much time and thought, and&#xD;
into which she had also unconsciously put a good deal of&#xD;
herself. She failed in no school duty; she seldom left her&#xD;
desk in the morning; but she no longer looked up or smiled&#xD;
when Precious approached her; and when she sat in the&#xD;
empty school-room correcting her theme, she sometimes&#xD;
stopped to think over the German lessons ; their ending ;&#xD;
the poor flowers which had been the cause of so much un-&#xD;
happiness to her; and she felt bitterly, that, though she&#xD;
had gained much knowledge'during the term, she had&#xD;
learned one lesson which could never be unlearned. She&#xD;
knew what it meant to lose a friend.&#xD;
".Changes," that was the subject she chose; and she&#xD;
&#xD;
had much to say upon it, and did her best to say it tel1.&#xD;
Griselda expected great things of her; Vashti had writ-&#xD;
ten her letters on the matter, and she had a pride in her&#xD;
effort. She wished to write an essay worth keeping;&#xD;
worth looking at afterwards. She talked it over with&#xD;
Candace, read it piece by piece, till Pet could correct&#xD;
any slip she made. She confided in Goody, who told her,&#xD;
with a heavy groan, "Yea, there be a change, lass, that&#xD;
makes the life lone; God grant ye may never come&#xD;
through that;" and when the girl's face got still, and her&#xD;
beautiful" eyes were heavy with unshed tears, she laid.&#xD;
down her flail, and pulling her nursling to her lap, she&#xD;
kissed her, holding her fast in her stout arms, cradling&#xD;
her in mother-love.  A great, rough 'creature Goody&#xD;
Ruddock seemed to outsiders, with her bass voice; her&#xD;
big whip lashing the oxen; ruling the horses; the man's&#xD;
work she did, and did well every day. But to these girls&#xD;
she was as loving as she was massive ; often sorrowful,&#xD;
often regretful; brooding over the dreadful ways and&#xD;
woes she had endured, but never indifferent or forgetful&#xD;
of the needs of her charges ; she would have fought for&#xD;
them; I think she would have died for them; her life&#xD;
was hid in theirs.&#xD;
When the time came, and the compositions were re&#xD;
turned to the pupils corrected by the teacher, Orchis&#xD;
got hers with the rest. Teacher Plunkett handed it with&#xD;
*a smile.&#xD;
"You will find how I have endeavored to express my&#xD;
estimate of your ' Changes,' Miss Dunwreath," said he.&#xD;
"I hope you will commend-my skill as ar artist, even if&#xD;
you do not approve my criticism."&#xD;
He had drawn a neat pair of scales, in one of which&#xD;
lay Orchis' theme, in the other an airy plume; as from&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

310    WHAT IS LIGHTER THAN A FEATHERS?&#xD;
A.canary's wing; and while the essay kicked the beam,&#xD;
the tiny pen dropped low, outweighing it; and underneath&#xD;
was written:&#xD;
" What is lighter than a feather ?"&#xD;
This finished Precious' chance of friendliness with&#xD;
his pupil. Her face was very Vale, while she tore the&#xD;
theme to shreds and shoved the bits into the stove; she&#xD;
wept no tears, nor showed any signs of resentment&#xD;
toward him, making her recitations as usual, walking&#xD;
home book in hand, "so near and yet so far."&#xD;
Precious was sorry for the affront he had put upon her,&#xD;
but it was done; she would give him no opportunity to&#xD;
help it. Nobody knew it but the two: Precious had&#xD;
ceased talking of her to his mother ever since the com-&#xD;
mittee meeting, and Orchis knew no better way to dis-&#xD;
pose of griefs than to bury them. She withdrew from&#xD;
the readings, and kept aloof in any place where he might&#xD;
have approached her.&#xD;
Only one mirth-provoking event marked examination-&#xD;
day. Blush paid punctually the six dollars window&#xD;
money. He brought it in copper cents; six hundred!&#xD;
He made a little speech, bringing in Esquire Redmond's&#xD;
maxim -about taking care of the pennies, as the boys&#xD;
dragged up the bags and opened them at the feet of the&#xD;
astonished trustee. The applause of the spectators was&#xD;
long and' loud, and it was a weary time before the old&#xD;
gentleman heard the last of his bargain.&#xD;
Orchis Dunwreath was awarded the first prize in&#xD;
scholarship. Teacher Plunkett came down himself from&#xD;
his rostrum, and laid oit on her desk with a bow and&#xD;
pleasant words. After he was gone she sat an instant&#xD;
with her eyes fixed on the handsome book, a red-lined&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
WHAT 169 LIGHTER THAN A FEATHER?&#xD;
copy of " The Magic Ring "-she had wished for it, and&#xD;
had spoken the wish in-his hearing.&#xD;
A faint flush rose to her cheek, and her eyes turned&#xD;
toward him. 110w much she could have liked the gift&#xD;
from a friend. Having no friend, she would have none&#xD;
of the book; and leaving her place, she lifted the volume&#xD;
and put it down on the desk where-she used to drop her&#xD;
roses; she thought of them as she laid it out-of her hand.&#xD;
"You. swept my poor flowers from here into your&#xD;
waste-basket," said she, looking into his eyes. "I will&#xD;
not so dishonor your offering to me. Although I do not&#xD;
wish to keep it, I will not treat unkindly the token which&#xD;
might have been a prize to me if your churlishness had&#xD;
not made it worthless." She waited for no reply. Turning&#xD;
quietly away from him, she took her place again, and,&#xD;
opening her history, she read on from the sentence she&#xD;
was conning when interrupted. It was so quickly done,&#xD;
and with so little fuss, that the changing class, who were&#xD;
rising when she arose, had scarcely taken their seats&#xD;
w en she resumed hers. But Precious' face flamed scarlet&#xD;
as he dashed the book beneath the desk-lid. "Such an&#xD;
outspoken girl! such straightforward ways!" and yet he&#xD;
could not keep his eyes from looking at her, nor his&#xD;
thoughts from dwelling on her.&#xD;
So the school was over; and shutting the door, they&#xD;
shut themselves out of its duties, its pleasures, and its&#xD;
troubles, and turned a fresh page in their lives.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HAVE YOU MET TH1i] HONEY-BEE?&#xD;
&#xD;
HE month of May brought 'Vashti Dunwreath&#xD;
home from   her medicAl school on her spring&#xD;
vacation, such a different woman from the one&#xD;
who left, only a short while ago, the unchanging routine&#xD;
of her shut-in farm-life. Blithe, debonnaire, elastic in&#xD;
spirits and health; her awe and dread of Clytie all out of&#xD;
sight, with a purpose straight before her which she felt&#xD;
able to compass, a vocation she meant to fill, to make tell&#xD;
in every way on herself in culture and growth, and on&#xD;
her fellow-creatures in helpfulness.&#xD;
"I shall set poor bones gratis, but the rich must pay&#xD;
for the practical skill and science I mean to bestow on&#xD;
my patients," said she in one of her often talks with her&#xD;
twin sister.&#xD;
It may well be supposed that "the children," as they&#xD;
were still called, sat at her feet literally, and metaphori-&#xD;
cally listening to her experiences, her jdans for the future,&#xD;
which largely included them in their fruition.&#xD;
There was a little hitch for a brief period after Griselda&#xD;
told her love-story; but as the two clasped each other in&#xD;
a close embrace 'which Griselda would have, minding&#xD;
no frowns, no averted eyes in the life-long sharer of her&#xD;
&#xD;
bed and board, it came ont clear and bright; they wept&#xD;
some tears, xchanged some regrets, but t heywere not&#xD;
plucked asunder by this foreign heart coming in among&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"He is a noble man, I do believe," said Vashti; "rich&#xD;
in strength and wisdom. If we must have a brother, I&#xD;
am glad he is the chosen. Heigho! five old maids no&#xD;
longer. Well, Grisel, may you be the joyful mother of&#xD;
children ! We will love each other none the less, I think:&#xD;
but he must look to his laurels or I shall steal his paw&#xD;
tients."&#xD;
" All you are able, dear, and welcome," replied Gri&#xD;
selda, brightly smiling. "You are noble to take it so; I&#xD;
had dreaded to tell you; I need not, though. You have a&#xD;
good, true heart, my sister ; you are both brave and ten&#xD;
der; you bore the old life better than I did; you chafed&#xD;
less, you worked harder and more cheerfully. The chil-&#xD;
dren shall have comfort out of the partnership; they will&#xD;
get a canty home and jocund blithesomeness in our&#xD;
house, find friends in our circle. I can do. much for&#xD;
them married to Dr. Mattoon which I could not compass&#xD;
as a lone woman, an old maid. If only something would&#xD;
happen to shake Clytie out of her dead shell, I would not&#xD;
mind any upturning or overthrow which might effect it,&#xD;
Aid restore us even a shadow of our own dear Olytie,&#xD;
kind, loving, sweet as she used to be. You young ones&#xD;
can't remember much about those old times, but we&#xD;
twins do; how she managed the house, how hospitable,1&#xD;
charitable, complete she was ; how sympathetic aind&#xD;
thoughtful, how equable and sunny. I hope and trust we&#xD;
shall all be fairly good women, but none of us at our&#xD;
best could ever be what Clytie was before that dreadful&#xD;
day when she seemed to turn to ice, to marble ! she,;80&#xD;

ful1 of caresses, and smiles, and friendliness, forgot in a.&#xD;
moment how to love, how to feel."&#xD;
".What do you think would follow if that man should&#xD;
ever cross her path?" asked Vashti musingly.&#xD;
'iI cannot guess; I have often tried to think; I believe&#xD;
she would murder him out of hand."&#xD;
"1Heaven keep them apart 1" answered Griselda, shud&#xD;
dering; " we have suffered bitterly enough for somebody's&#xD;
crime! let us have only true, pure living among ourselves&#xD;
for evermore."&#xD;
"We shall know whose crime killed our father before&#xD;
we die," said Orchis.&#xD;
They all turned their eyes wonderingly upon the girl,&#xD;
who was looking on the ground. The assertion had a&#xD;
tone of positive conviction which was certainty. "I only&#xD;
hope," she added, "the knowledge will not bring us&#xD;
more misery."&#xD;
"Look ! there goes Olytie!" exclaimed Vashti, inter-&#xD;
rupting the silence of thought which fell upon them all&#xD;
after Orchis' words; "saw you ever such a dead face&#xD;
upon a living woman? Poor girl, how I wish I could&#xD;
help her! I cannot forget her even when I am happiest ;&#xD;
she seems to chill me, to rebuke my cheerfulness; still I&#xD;
feel that we are right ; living in God's world, we have a&#xD;
claim on the fair fulness of it."&#xD;
"Yes, and we will work for what we take also,"&#xD;
echoed Griselda.&#xD;
"Griselda," asked Orchis, who sat at her sister's feet,&#xD;
holding one of her hands, "are not all men alike?&#xD;
Would your Dr. Mattoon stand by you, do you think,&#xD;
through a trial such as Clytie's?"&#xD;
Unconsciously the woman tightened her clasp of her&#xD;
sister's fingers. " If I thought there was that lack in him&#xD;
&#xD;
AVdff 'YOU EfTET THE HONRYE-REEa     is&#xD;
&#xD;
which should cause him to fall away in any trial, I would&#xD;
pray night and day that the ordeal might come," said she.&#xD;
"It seems to me that men are too unstable to make-&#xD;
firm friends," said Orchis; "sisters are best: nothing could&#xD;
ever sunder us." Then as Candace looked at her and&#xD;
smiled, she remembered how she had thought hardly'of&#xD;
the 'child, and she opened her arms to her pet, who made&#xD;
haste to nestle into them. The others, looking on, thought&#xD;
onr"how the children love each other." So little can&#xD;
we 'know of the secret workings of the inner lives of our&#xD;
best and dearest.&#xD;
Olytie went and came among her flowers, entirely un-&#xD;
mindful of everything going on around her. After a&#xD;
while the fear which had troubled the sisters, that she&#xD;
might leave them, died away, and sloe looked and lived&#xD;
just as she had six months agone.&#xD;
After much consultation and a good deal of thought&#xD;
among the four-for little Candace was admitted to the&#xD;
family counsels, which she mixed with fun and kittenish&#xD;
tricks--Orchis had decided to apply for the summer&#xD;
school as a beginning of her independence. The fact&#xD;
that'- Dr. Mattoon was on the board made her success&#xD;
look easy, though the young aspirant declined any inter-&#xD;
ference on Griselda's part, determining to go in on merit&#xD;
if at all. Of course Blush Beach was not left out of the&#xD;
talks, and the restless lustihood did his best to be a sedate&#xD;
wiseacre'on these occasions, though he took opportunities&#xD;
to detail to Orchis fearful perils of "big boys, partial&#xD;
parents,'%sand so on, which he gave as experiences, but&#xD;
surrounded with a deep fringe of invention. Nothing&#xD;
alarmed or daunted her; she was steadfast and deter&#xD;
mined.&#xD;
Never had Clytie's greenhouse been so rich in beauties&#xD;

&#xD;
and never had the grave under the wailing pines been so&#xD;
gorgeously adorned. Goody Ruddock was nearly -ubiqni..=&#xD;
toxus; her powerful constitution stood her in good stead&#xD;
always. No flaws appeared on account of the absentees ;&#xD;
the farm and stock were in admirable condition, and the&#xD;
house-keeping moved on as if no hands had ceased from&#xD;
their labors..&#xD;
Early this particular morning Clytie had taken her&#xD;
gun and walked off toward the long wood. When such&#xD;
fits came over her she seldom returned while daylight&#xD;
lasted; and without any intended disloyalty to her, such&#xD;
occasions were hailed with jubilance by the children, or&#xD;
rather by Candace, for Orchis we know was rarely actively&#xD;
sportful; and this spring, with its winter experiences and&#xD;
opening responsibilities, found her even more quiet and&#xD;
uniform than ever. Candace frolicked all around her;&#xD;
she liked it, though she chided sometimes her obstreperous&#xD;
jollity; and really it is a joy to frisk and laugh and run&#xD;
and jump, especially when the daily life is bound down&#xD;
to-silence.&#xD;
Goody Ruddock watched the delicate feat of tying the&#xD;
studious Orchis to her chair by a dozen strands of cord,&#xD;
while the saucy, rosy-lipped jailor knelt at her feet and&#xD;
gave her nose a little brush upward, waiting for her to&#xD;
feel her fetters. Goody looked on with grim smiles-&#xD;
even when Goody was most benevolent and amiable, her&#xD;
smiles and voice had always a memory of wrong and&#xD;
suffering and resentment in them.&#xD;
"Thou'rt a tricksy lass," said she, hindering herself to&#xD;
await the upshot 'of the prank, while she balanced on her&#xD;
head tub of clean clothes; "maythy heart be ever as&#xD;
briigt though thou'rt like a primrose growing in a&#xD;
chireihyard."&#xD;

"Nay, then, Goody, why should I sigh away my spring-&#xD;
time to psalm Pines while. I have Orchis to make inerry&#xD;
with ?"&#xD;
"Why, trulychick! But he who sows cockle shall reap&#xD;
no corn; an' thou wilt not. plant in planting time, thou&#xD;
shalt reap no harvest. But go thy ways for a sunny elf ;&#xD;
skipple while skipple ye may; the skies may darken over-&#xD;
your head till ye can see no light, before ye get far on.&#xD;
I was a blithe maid at yer age meself."&#xD;
"Were you ever young and small and gay, Goody?&#xD;
There! do not frown, dear Goody; I love you big and&#xD;
stout and grown. Kiss me, Goody,; oh, you cannot! you&#xD;
will tilt off your burden. Oh! what strong strength is&#xD;
yours which can stoop to me and rise again with that tub&#xD;
upon your head; I wish I could clamber up and sit in&#xD;
it, and be carried to the bleachery. No? then I'll dance !&#xD;
Look howI can spin !"&#xD;
Balancing herself on one foot, she whirled rapidly in a&#xD;
circle not larger than a bucket-hoop, twenty times or&#xD;
more, and ended with a fancy step which Blush 'had&#xD;
taught her, rocking on her crossed feet while her eyes&#xD;
laughed into those looking in grim admiration upon her&#xD;
antics.&#xD;
" There ! Goody Ruddock. If you know of a wild fairy&#xD;
who can skit and reel, better than I, you shall tell me the&#xD;
tale of her to-night when supper is done. Come, Orchis ;&#xD;
let's hem our frills which Griselda cut this morning to&#xD;
border the new aprons, on the great butternut tree.&#xD;
There! look now, Goody!1 she cannot rise. What :holds&#xD;

darken her soul or' chill her heart, did it, Goody? I am&#xD;
'glad, we love her bright rays. Yes, I'll come to the tree,&#xD;
and you shall hear me in my verbs, Candace, while I sew&#xD;
for you. Oh, how I dread that awful examination! I&#xD;
wonder if I shall pass."&#xD;
"Precious says there is no doubt whatever about it."&#xD;
"I did not ask or desire his opinion," answered&#xD;
Orchis coldly.&#xD;
"Well, then, Blush says the old fogies don't know&#xD;
enough to puzzle a flea."&#xD;
"But my wit is so slender and so tender that it will not&#xD;
bear tossing, as said somebody in your book ; and I have.&#xD;

"Come on,.then, doubtful Orchis; you shall not have'&#xD;
time to sneeze thrice till I.prove to you, by your own&#xD;
knowledge, that you are a match for the committee, with&#xD;
the visitors to back them. See Goody ! how she steps&#xD;
undei- that heavy tub! Is she not like the Amazon&#xD;
Myrina Precious read to us. about, who took care of&#xD;

HE Cherry Brook stage, making its daily journey,&#xD;
passed along the road, about three o'clock, carry-&#xD;
ing outside a passenger, who rode with the driver,&#xD;
beguiling the way with scraps of talk, having first put Jehn&#xD;
in expansive good-humor by the gift of.a prime cigar.&#xD;
Such a remarkably handsome passenger as to be&#xD;
worthy of a particular description: a symmetrical passen-&#xD;
ger every way, in proportion, feature, carriage, and color ;&#xD;
wonderful eyes, so large, soft, liquid, eloquent,-but I&#xD;
forgot, just here was a shade of imperfection, for one of&#xD;
those beautiful orbs was a brilliant blue;, the other, the&#xD;
tawny hue of a lion. You might look a hundred times&#xD;
in his face, and always find something strange in its fas-&#xD;
cination, without discovering the peculiarity, the brows&#xD;
were so clearly lined; and the lashes so long And curling;&#xD;
and when it did strike you, you wondered why all faces&#xD;
were not so marked, because, instead of seeing a blemish,&#xD;
you felt it a graceandcharm. 'His hair was rich chest-&#xD;
nut brown, his silky mustache and full flowing beard the&#xD;
same glossy hue; his dress perfection, and the very&#xD;
louch of his gray beaver was seemly and becoming; and&#xD;

anion, gon would have felt it impossible not to echo his&#xD;
mirth, it was so genuine, and its expression so musical.&#xD;
"A. very pretty bit of ground, indeed, is this which we.'&#xD;
are passing; a charming garden; and a greenhouse!&#xD;
Certes ! that is an out-of-the-way luxury for these country&#xD;
folks. Pray, who lives here?"&#xD;
"Well, as true as you breathe, there's a queer lot of&#xD;
women housed in yonder ; they run their own farm, set&#xD;
their bull-dog on to all the men that tries to get inside&#xD;
that there high fence; folks hereabouts calls 'em 'the.&#xD;
old mnaids,' though I must allow I think its rather out of&#xD;
spite, cause they won't let on to nobody, than 'cause&#xD;
they're dreadful aged, any on 'em, 'cept the Tom big.one,&#xD;
that stands nigh a foot higher than I do ; and I sway ! they&#xD;
say she'll stick a hog, douse it into the scalding-tub, and&#xD;
= yank him oAt again afore you can hear him' squeal twice.&#xD;
She is a buster, that's a fact. I reckon she ain't much but&#xD;
a servant to the rest. There's five on 'em, and from the,&#xD;
peeks I can get when I go by,-for I must confess I do feel&#xD;
kinder curious about their, turning the cold shoulder to,&#xD;
the men so,-I should call 'em all harnsuin, and I shouldn't&#xD;
Bet the oldest one down more'n twenty-five either.&#xD;
There's the Ton big one now, choppin' wood by the&#xD;
kitchen door! I think her name is Goody Ruddock ; least-&#xD;
ways, that's what I heard the little girl a-screamin out to&#xD;
her one day. She said, 'Goody Ruddock! Goody Rd-&#xD;
dock! come and help me catch my calfs!'"&#xD;
The handsome passenger took his cigar from his lips&#xD;
and turned .his eyes' upon the driver, lustrous, strange,&#xD;
full of something .which might have been surprise, or it&#xD;
might be dread.&#xD;
"What did you say was the name of this - this--s&#xD;
eiouselold of women ? " asked he slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
VASHTI SETS BROKEN 90      .       S&#xD;
"Nobody calls 'em any name but 'the old rnaide.'&#xD;
They're got a name, a nice-sounding name too; I seen it&#xD;
once on a deed I fetched when they bought the Dolman&#xD;
land, down there,-sixty-three acres, part of the Major&#xD;
Dolmantract, that the old gentleman trafficked out of the&#xD;
Injuns with a tanned sheepskin. You see, they told him&#xD;
he might have all he could get inside of it, and the cun-&#xD;
ning-&#xD;
ng--&#xD;
"But the name 1" interrupted the handsome passenger&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
"Well, may I set cross-legged and walk slip-slod, and&#xD;
call myself Snip the Tailor, as the feller says in the play,&#xD;
if you can't put on high when you're a mind to. I don't&#xD;
mind; I see all sorts on my road-  Their names is Dun-&#xD;
wreath. 0 lord! we're over!"&#xD;
It was true enough. The front left wheel, which had&#xD;
been wabbling for some time, struck the edge of a buried&#xD;
rock on the roadside and ran off, and the sudden tilto f&#xD;
the vehicle dashed the two outsides to the ground,por upn&#xD;
a pile of ragged rocks which had been dumped into.a&#xD;
hole close by; and the driver, who had sprawled his huge&#xD;
length exactly atop of his companion, scrambled quickly&#xD;
to his feet, with no more hurt than a few stone-bruises,&#xD;
but the handsome passenger did not stir.&#xD;
The insides tumbled out of the uppermost window of&#xD;
their prison, and when, after some exclamations and&#xD;
jumping about to assure themselves of the safety of lif&#xD;
and limb, they approached to inspect the quiet body of thei7&#xD;
stranger, he groaned heavily on being disturbed, but gav&#xD;
no other sign of consciousness.&#xD;
" Well, here's a go! 'his wrist is broken to a dead cer-&#xD;
tainty, and I think a leg also, and what's to do?"&#xD;
" Carry him into this farm-~house of course," suggested&#xD;

one of the men; "that is the thing, and the only thin g&#xD;
and be lively about it too. Are they all dead, that ri'obody&#xD;
comes to help us!"&#xD;
"It's the.old maids; they never help nobody. You may&#xD;
knock on that gate till you drop, before you fetch a soul,&#xD;
cept, maybe, a bull-dog that'll tear the meat all off your,&#xD;
bones," replied the driver, walking around the sufferer,&#xD;
in a puzzle.'&#xD;
"That is a mistake, friend," said a third, who had his&#xD;
eye to a knot-hole in the fence," for here comes as spry-&#xD;
and handsome a girl as I have seen since I courted my&#xD;
Polly; and she is in a mighty hurry too. That's right,&#xD;
good lady! here is a poor fellow with broken bones who'&#xD;
needs your care!"&#xD;
As the gate flew open inwards, the spy nearly fell into&#xD;
Paslti's arms, who pushed him unceremoniously aside, as&#xD;
of minor consequence, and rushed to the aid of the suf-&#xD;
ferer.-&#xD;
She had seen the whole from her upper, window, and&#xD;
had hurried to the spot, eager to inspect the accident. So&#xD;
much change had a few months wrought in her ! A year&#xD;
ago an earthquake, dropping half Cherry Brook before&#xD;
their dwelling, would have scarcely brought her to un-&#xD;
lock the gate and look forth.&#xD;
After a quick survey of the senseless. man, andt a gentle&#xD;
touch of his injured limbs, she said briskly to the group&#xD;
bout her, who had stepped back a pace and were curi-&#xD;
ously watching her:&#xD;
"Bring him in, two of you who are strong enough to&#xD;
lift such a burden!"&#xD;
Such a challenge from  uch lips brought a ready re-&#xD;
sponse. Any of them felt strong enough ! Even the little&#xD;
weazengd old fellow in a skull-cap, whose legs were like&#xD;

pipe-sterns, and whose breath piped through .his skinny&#xD;
throat in an asthmatic whistle: he bustled up and tried to&#xD;
clutch a leg of the handsome passenger 'as they lifted&#xD;
him. Too late; the lusty ones had already moved off with&#xD;
their burden, and he narrowly escaped being knocked&#xD;
down and trodden on, as he skurried aside, looking for an&#xD;
approving glance from the fresh, ruddy maiden, whose&#xD;
thoughts were all busy with the work in hand.&#xD;
They laid him gently on a bed in the great front&#xD;
chainber- and though the bearers used curiously their&#xD;
eyes, they espied nothing to repay their eagerness: a&#xD;
large, bare, uninviting, tenantless room, cool and gray in&#xD;
the, half light of its darkened windows: any farm-house on&#xD;
the road held its like; and none of the sisters visible; the&#xD;
driver hurried them away as fast as he could.&#xD;
"Sorry to leave you in the lurch so, Miss; but you see&#xD;
Pve got to catch the train, if the devil stands at the door.&#xD;
Good-day! I wish I could stop and help you, but I dare&#xD;
say you've got folks, handier than what I be, to step after&#xD;
the doctor."&#xD;
"I need no help, thank you," replied Vashti; "'I can set&#xD;
bones myself, and shall lose no time when the place is&#xD;
clear."&#xD;
" Really, now, that's lucky! Well, we'd best be goin'.&#xD;
Good-day!" He left, twisting his head over his shoulder&#xD;
to see all he could of the beauty who could manage&#xD;
broken limbs, and pretty soon he came tearing back, bring-&#xD;
ing a heavy valise. "Excuse haste and bad pen, as the&#xD;
pig said when he ran away from his sty," he puffed out,&#xD;
dropping the luggage; "I've fetched- the gentleman's&#xD;
traps. It kinder looks as if he might need a change afore&#xD;
he leaves your hos-pit-a-ble abode."&#xD;
" Well, by jingo!" he added, as he ran back to his coach&#xD;

and busied his hands with the necessary repairs; "I don't&#xD;
see what they want to tack' old maid' onto that putty crea-&#xD;
tur for ; she's as fresh as a ripe peach. Pm glad he fell&#xD;
agto such hands ; I wouldn't mind breakin' a bone or two&#xD;
myself, to get into such quarters with such a harnsum&#xD;
nuss; I wouldn't, so help me John Rogers !"&#xD;
When the young surgeon had set the fracture with Or-&#xD;
chis' help (who came with her first call, pale as marble,&#xD;
and silently obeyed every look and word, while Candace&#xD;
dropped into a corner shivering and affrighted), bound up&#xD;
the bruises, sewed up the cuts, and washed the dirt and&#xD;
soil from her patient's face, she stopped to see what he&#xD;
was like. Half a moment's surprise, then anger, then&#xD;
fear seized on her, and she ran nimbly, looking backward&#xD;
as if she were fleeing from an evil spirit. Galling loudly.&#xD;
for Goody Ruddock, she dragged her by the arm ,close to&#xD;
the bedside, the old woman letting herself be drawn any&#xD;
whither by her first nursling, even if a fire and faggot&#xD;
awaited her at the end of her road.&#xD;
"Look ! Goody," said she, giving -the great head a&#xD;
quick dip, pushing it at the back; ."look down there,&#xD;
 Goody! who is this man 've pickedoff the rock-heap?"&#xD;
"Ugh! the wretch! the warlock ! the kelpie! the&#xD;

I'l dash him from the highth! Miss Olytie shall not be'&#xD;
driv' mad with the finding his feet in her path again, after&#xD;
those gone years. Stand aside, bairnie, till I drop him !"&#xD;
"Stop ! Goody, not so fast," replied Vashti, seizing the&#xD;
woman's arm as she prepared to make good her threat,&#xD;
bearing down upon her-victim with a powerful swoop, while&#xD;
her gloomy eyes burned in savage rage. " Stop, Goody !&#xD;
he is cast upon our charities defenceless; we won't turn&#xD;
him out to die; that would make us worse than he. Iehall&#xD;

conduct. No! stand off ! you shall not, I say shall not,&#xD;
harm 'hun ! It is a compound fracture, a dehecate case&#xD;
full of interesting splinters; I may not get another such a&#xD;
subject for years. I will cure him. He is coming back to.&#xD;
his senses, which mercifully left him while I dressed the&#xD;
wounds. Handsome as Absolom! -The love of Clytie's&#xD;

sprained wrist. What will poor Clytie say ! Hush! here&#xD;
she is coming up the stairs. Stand back, Orchis! take your&#xD;
eyes off the man, child! Ugh! how cold your fingers are.&#xD;
Be still, Candace!"&#xD;
They made way for. her to approach the bed where lay&#xD;
the bundle of manly beauty and manly consummate-&#xD;
ness who had failed her at her utmost need, whose cow-.&#xD;
ardice had made her eyes sere and her life empty. 'They&#xD;
scarcely breathed while she stood still, as white as marble,&#xD;
gazing into the pallid face she had not seen since it was&#xD;
aglow with love for her; whose adorable radiance was as&#xD;
fresh in her memory as if the last meeting in the library&#xD;
had-been yester eve.&#xD;
The breath came evenly through her thin nostrils, and&#xD;
but for her dilating eyes, black as midnight, and a slight_&#xD;
pressure of her humid lips, they might have supposed&#xD;
she had no especial interest in what lay beneath her burn-&#xD;
ing gaze.&#xD;
With a slow filling of his lungs, which expanded his&#xD;
broad chest, and an exhaled sigh, he lifted his heavily&#xD;
fringed lids and -those wonderful eyes, one lue and the&#xD;
other tawny like -a lion's, dreamily lustrous, and hardly&#xD;
taking cognizance of his surroundings, rested, after an&#xD;
instant, in a troubled gaze which soon consciously centred&#xD;

on the woman beside him, contracting his fine brows&#xD;
and clouding his whole face; then he closed them while&#xD;
a faint shiver of pain passed over him, and he murmured:&#xD;
" Clytie Dunwreath at last!" &#xD;
"Donald McQueen returned from Europe!"&#xD;
Clytie wheeled about and went straight "to her room,&#xD;
where they heard her pacing up and down for an hour or.&#xD;
more.. Then she descended, visited her greenhouse,'&#xD;
culled with careful particularity a ,great bunch of her&#xD;
choicest blooms, which she took in her hand away down&#xD;
to her grave under the moaning pines. Having arranged&#xD;
them with pains-taking nicety at the head, she sat down&#xD;
at the foot; and burying her face in her hands, she re-&#xD;
mained motionless till the day-dawn.&#xD;
Goody Ruddock followed and watched her from afar;&#xD;
and while her restless spirit, faithful as a trusty dog,&#xD;
hovered near, she dared not approach or disturb the&#xD;
vigil whose sequence she could not even guess.&#xD;
With the rising of the sun, Olytie. appeared in the sick-&#xD;
chamber, where Vashti was sitting by tle bed wetting the&#xD;
bandages of the sleeping man.&#xD;
". I will not trouble you further, Vashti," said she in her,&#xD;
ringing voice. "This is my place; I shall fill it."&#xD;
" Don't murder the poor fellow ; he is half dead already.&#xD;
Let him live long enough to speak for himself."&#xD;
Vashti half unconsciously gave breath to a thought&#xD;
born of Clytie's eyes. " Dont murder him, Clytiminestra,"&#xD;
she finished slowly, with her gaze fastened on the woman&#xD;
at her side. She.ought not to have uttered the word-; she&#xD;
knew how Clytie used to hate it ; what a trial it was to-&#xD;
bear the infamous name; but something in the air and car-&#xD;
iage-of the would-be nurse impelled her to speak.&#xD;
""No need for any fears, Vashti," she replied; "I have&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
VASHTI SETS BROKEN BONES.            2&#xD;
no twenty men to set upon him, nor shall I sew up the&#xD;
sleeves of his garment. Oh no; I shall use all my woman's&#xD;
care and wit to restore Mr. Donald McQueen to health,&#xD;
and I shall depend on the skill you boast to aid me."&#xD;
"NTow you talk sense, Clytie. Let bygones be bygones."~&#xD;
"I live but in the present,-and in the future," replied&#xD;
Clytie, with unchanging, emotionless face.&#xD;
Vashti looked at her elder sister, vainly trying to&#xD;
measure the value of her answer.  It sounded friendly,&#xD;
and yet it and the allusion to her abominably significant&#xD;
name jarred upon her ear like a deathful threat. Her&#xD;
face was serene, yet some sort of change had passed upon&#xD;
it: for its usual marble whiteness she had gotten " a delicate&#xD;
vermil tinge, as steeped in the richest hues of pale red&#xD;
roses." She was alive to the finest fibre; and a palpitating&#xD;
intensity thrilled over her, as she laughed :a low breath-&#xD;
ing of music, but yet a frightful laugh, as of a fiend who&#xD;
revels in the perdition of the best-beloved.&#xD;
"Ah! Clytiminestra," said Vashti, who was fascinated&#xD;
and repelled by the strange beauty of glitter and stillness&#xD;
she saw before her.&#xD;
" A sweet-sounding word of deep significance ! With&#xD;
this good pistol in her lovely hand, she would have needed&#xD;
no distilled poisons. No foolish nymph was she, turning&#xD;
always to the careless sun-god, who liked her not; a woman&#xD;
of deeds and will. YQu were wise to name her to me over&#xD;
this thing of wounds and bruises. I thank you. Now to&#xD;
my work ; I nurse, I watch, I wait."&#xD;
It was terrible retribution for the bundle of manly&#xD;
beauty and manly consummateness, to be thus disabled and&#xD;
stranded; at the mercy of the girl he had jilted; depend-&#xD;
ant on her for the food he ate, the smallest comforts: a&#xD;
sup of water, a cool pillow, a taste of broth. She would&#xD;

permit no hands but hers to minister to his needs, and&#xD;
she sat quietly watching him by the hour. Vainly he&#xD;
tried to shut out the glance; beneath his closed lids lie&#xD;
saw it still: her black, black eyes, her flossy hair of -yellow&#xD;
flax, her adorable mouth, rosy-lipped, humid, velvety:&#xD;
purely beautiful was she.- The Clytie he had left that&#xD;
night, clad in azure crape, with damask buds in her pale&#xD;
blue snood and -perfuming her breast-knot, was both&#xD;
lovely and loving'; here she sat the same woman in a&#xD;
straight;, homespun gown-was she loving still ? She often&#xD;
smiled on him, her touch was gentle, and her voice muir-&#xD;
muring music.&#xD;
" You are killing my patient by inches!" said Vashti&#xD;
after the fourth day.  "He is on the verge of a brain&#xD;
feyer. Is this your aim and desire ?"&#xD;
"No; Ihave told you I desire his recovry to health. I&#xD;
z=_have omitted no care, neglected no remedy."&#xD;
"And your eyes are basilisks to him; your touch is&#xD;
fatal. If you don't want to have a maniac or a corpse on&#xD;
your hands you must, keep out of his sight and leave him&#xD;
to me. No bones could knit while the blood is in such a&#xD;
f erment."&#xD;
"Strange, is it not? He has chanted full oft and pass-&#xD;
ing well the praises of my beautiful eyes, and vowed that&#xD;
my charms might inspire the dead to rise and praise&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Vashti felt her flesh creep. "Clytie!" she said, in a&#xD;
half whisper, "remove your baleful presence from that&#xD;
sick-room; do not enter the door again. Leave me to wor.&#xD;
my cure."'&#xD;
Clytie had, risen to fetch a basin of cool water from the&#xD;
spring ; and returning, she stood with theiournd dropson&#xD;
her firm arm, as on fine marble, where they sglshed&#xD;

"I will not!" she replied; "he shall recover through my&#xD;

presently to my own place. Who should watch with&#xD;

As Vashti left her, she called Goody Ruddock to her&#xD;
assistance; and mounting to the old garret, they fetched&#xD;
thence one of the dusty trunks, which they deposited in&#xD;
her room.&#xD;
Shutting the door on the trusty servant, Olytie un-&#xD;
locked it; and taking out a morning-robe of soft gray  and,&#xD;
pale rose facings,.a pair of satin toilette slippers, diamond&#xD;
quilted and~edged 'with quilled ribbons, and a clinging&#xD;
shawl of knit zephyr of the most delicate tints, she put,&#xD;
them on; and flitting softly out, she bent her steps to her&#xD;
greenhouse, and took thence a potted' plant in fullest&#xD;
bloom, and bore it carefully in- her arms to her grave&#xD;
beneath the pines. It was a strange selection she had&#xD;
made; a weird, uncanny thing : a blood-red arum, stately&#xD;
and dangerous; whose stem was speckled like a frog's&#xD;
back, its fancifully cut leaves flecked with snow. Yes-&#xD;
terday it began to show its sanguinary hue on the&#xD;
edges of' its scolloped spike ; to-day it unfolded its&#xD;
threatening emflorescenee, horrible to look at, in ;ec1&#xD;
like the stagnant blood-ooze from a dead man'swon d&#xD;
while its long purple shining spadix shot straight ua&#xD;
from its red spathe like a reeking weapon,' a pestifer~&#xD;
thing, a deadly poison, smelling like a loathly corf  "&#xD;

its malignant breath reached her where she stood;- she&#xD;
watched her place it over the sleeper's heart, saw her&#xD;
kneel, bending above it as if whispering to the dead be-&#xD;
low, and then return to her. greenhouse, whence she&#xD;
emerged, having moss-buds and violets in her breast, aid&#xD;
mounted, to the sick-room, where she appeared like a ra-&#xD;
diant vision, carrying in her hand a basket of fresh flowers&#xD;
hose odors wafted before her like incense.&#xD;
Vashti had gone, and Orchis, and Candace;met her on&#xD;
the ending, but stepped aside in dumb wonder while she&#xD;
passed, looking straight on s if she saw them not. Very&#xD;
likelyshe was not conscious of their presence, for all her&#xD;
faculties were centred in one point, so as to leave no&#xD;
sensibility to outside neighborings.&#xD;
"Is not Clytie lovely?" whispered Candace, s she disap-&#xD;
pealed.&#xD;
"Terrible, I think," answered Orchis with a shudder.&#xD;
I5I had rather -she would wear the homespun gown, and&#xD;
whip us, as she used in the other times.  It ;makes me&#xD;
chilly like ice to think of her. I hope nothing dreatiful is&#xD;
going to happen. Last night I dreamed I walked with her&#xD;
on a long bridge leading to the pleasant land, and when&#xD;
we were half across, it opened in a wide chasm impossi-&#xD;
ble to "pass. I stood still, but Clytie stepped down on&#xD;
someloose timbers'itrying to find a safe way, and then I&#xD;
put out my hand and'touched the rail and the timbers&#xD;
drew together, and I went on in sa'fty, but I could not&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
BEAUTY WITHOUT STRENGTH IS IMPERFECTION.&#xD;
4 EANTIME Clytie had entered the sick man's&#xD;
room- and found him alone.  Vashti was both&#xD;
brave and curious, but: she did not care to meet&#xD;
her sister just now; she shut herself into the corn-crib, and&#xD;
preserved a hawk which Goody took from the huntress'&#xD;
pouch the day of her last solitude in the deep wood, and&#xD;
which had been seasoning ever since in poisons.  Vashti&#xD;
was not brave enough to face Clytie, but she was fearless&#xD;
among her venoms.&#xD;
Mr. McQueen had just wakened from a sleep; and he&#xD;
could scarcely believe his senses when he saw those&#xD;
beautiful dark eyes smiling on him, her white teeth and&#xD;
the play of her adorable lips in the tuneful words of her.&#xD;
-greeting, animated and gracious.&#xD;
"Good-morrow! Donald; see what I have brought yon.&#xD;
The surly surgeon  does not wish me to place them here, I&#xD;
know; she pretends they are baleful. It cannot be, because&#xD;
flowers, any flowers, which I have reared and brought to&#xD;
bloom that they might blush and glow under the eyes of&#xD;
a true flower-lover who knows them all by name, cannot&#xD;
have any harm in their sweetness. Are they not lovely?&#xD;
They are friends full of memories.  You see all your&#xD;

favorites: tea-roses, mignonette, carnations, violets, anem-&#xD;
ones ; even the royal lily you are so fond of liking to&#xD;
the sun-god's Olytie, consecrated to your use, but now&#xD;
taken from the holiest altar in the whole world. I have&#xD;
forgotten nothing; yes, nothing."&#xD;
"Have I been dreaming?" said the bewildered listener,&#xD;
half aloud.&#xD;
"I think so, Donald ; are you sure you are fully awake.&#xD;
You had better pinch your cheeks with your movable fin-&#xD;
gers and find out, while I adorn your poor room. Had I&#xD;
known the guest who was admitted in my absence, you&#xD;
would have had a widely different welcome."&#xD;
She was arranging her roses in a glass on the stand&#xD;
near him as she said this, and she turned her full-orbed&#xD;
gaze upon his face, covering it an instant with heirintense&#xD;
eyes before she went on with her fanciful task.&#xD;
"You chose ill for the theatre of your adventure as&#xD;
far as luxuries count, but you found dome old familiar&#xD;
faces?"&#xD;
Stepping hither and thither before him, she completed&#xD;
her arrangement, chatting musically, and humming&#xD;
snatches of well-remembered songs, till at last she came&#xD;
and offered the medicine of the .hour.  " Open- your&#xD;
mguth, Donald; this. is to give you healthful strength ;&#xD;
beauty without strength is imperfection."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
ORCHIS TRIES SoHOOL-KEEPING.&#xD;
&#xD;
OBODY who has never tried it can form the re-&#xD;
motest idea of the wear and tear of mind and&#xD;
body consequent upon the office of school-ma' am&#xD;
in a county district. The rashly importunate girl who&#xD;
assumes the post must fight her way through all sorts&#xD;
of unpleasantness and vexations, stupid little boys and&#xD;
rascally big ones, who bend their whole energies to the&#xD;
feat of "plaguing the schoolma'am," especially if she is&#xD;
young and delicate, daintily bred, so as to contrast with&#xD;
their rough coarseness.  They eye her over, seeking her&#xD;
weak points, sensitive places, and out crops the brute and&#xD;
the bully every opportunity. The more frail and gentle&#xD;
she is, the harder her lot. Scruples must be left behind&#xD;
when she enters the school-house; only one course is left&#xD;
open: she must struggle for mastery, get it, or run away&#xD;
in disgrace.&#xD;
The happy mothers of boys tell us much about'their&#xD;
generosity, chivalry, goodness, and other cardinal vir-&#xD;
tues: I can't be supposed to know. I count it one of the&#xD;
blessings of my life that I have not had to come i con-&#xD;
tact with man boys. But if the be as richl endowed as&#xD;
Jove himself, I notice they leave their fine qualities out&#xD;
mostly, in their treatment of the schoolma'am.&#xD;

Thores de important preliminaries to be gone through&#xD;
before attaining the honor of pedagoguess: there is the&#xD;
inspection. The sharp-nosed gentleman who led the van&#xD;
of inquiries questioned Orchis minutely on the spelling-&#xD;
book, diving deeply into the mysteries of letter sounds-I&#xD;
when a is as in fat, when as in feathers. Then Esquire&#xD;
Raymond took up the theme.  He reckoned that the&#xD;
new-fangled method of teaching the letters was dreadful&#xD;
slip-shod ; for his part he learned out of a horn book-&#xD;
"A by itself, a ; E by itself, e;.I by itself, i; " and he&#xD;
rattled off the vowels so fast, and jumbled them so hope-&#xD;
lessly, that Orchis was quite dizzy trying to disentangle&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Then there was the facetious gentleman, Mr. Poinsett&#xD;
who sought to bewilder her in her talk, asking her, "Who&#xD;
was acrimonious?" with such a persuasive look as led her to&#xD;
reply, "The god of acrimony ; " also, Who was the father&#xD;
of Zebedee's children ? and if the Simplon was a moun-&#xD;
tain ir Weathersfield ? Andhe chuckled till he was red&#xD;
in the face over her easy plunge into his artful snares;&#xD;
but he made it up by shaking hands with her afterward,&#xD;
telling her she was a. good girl and he "notioned "'she'd&#xD;
keep a "gimmy school," and "he wished he was a boy&#xD;
again, to god to her, so he did."&#xD;
Then Esquire Redmond remarked that "for his-part he,&#xD;
should choose Miss Martingale to keep the school."&#xD;
"What ! Long Jane?" asked Mr. Poinsett. " Now it is&#xD;
a patent fact, Redmond, that she don't know a hawk from&#xD;
a handsaw."&#xD;
" I think everything of government," replied the Es-&#xD;
quire; "she was first-rate to flax out the young ones,&#xD;
and keep 'em up to toe the mark ; no fooling with&#xD;
her."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Air you a professor, young woman" inquired sharp-&#xD;
nose.&#xD;
" I am afraid I don't understand, sir," said Orchis.&#xD;
"Air you a member of an orthodox church, in good and&#xD;
regular standing?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Bad ! Well, you will have to open the school with&#xD;
prayer.".&#xD;
"I am afraid I could not do that."  Precious never&#xD;
did, she thought, but she stifled the recollection, and&#xD;
would not let his name pass her lips.&#xD;
"It is a rule, young woman,"'said sharp-nose, pom-&#xD;
pously tossing his silk handkerchief into his hat, held be-&#xD;
tween his knees, after a clarion peal from his peaked&#xD;
trumpet. "If you can't fulfil the dooties we require of&#xD;
our teacher, you shouldn't apply for the place ; we can&#xD;
find a plenty of pious girls who will jump 'for the situa-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"I don't feel inclined to jump for it," replied Orchis,&#xD;
whose lip curled slightly.; " but as I have made up my&#xD;
mind to get it if I can, I will learn by heart a prayer, if&#xD;
you make a point of it, and repeat it."&#xD;
"We do make a pint of the devotions, young woman,&#xD;
certainly. You must pay strict attention to them."&#xD;
At this stage of-the proceedings Dr. Mattoon hurriedly&#xD;
entered, leaving Griselda at the door._&#xD;
I can't stay a minute, Orchis dear," said he, taking&#xD;
both the girl's hands in his'; "I just want to add my vote&#xD;
to your engagement, and wish you success. So if you&#xD;
have-done with this lady, gentlemen, you make out her&#xD;
certificate, while you come and kiss Grisel, dear, who is&#xD;
waiting for you outside."&#xD;
" Have they picked you all to pieces, darling'I" were&#xD;
&#xD;
Griselda's first words as she looked pityingly in Orchis'&#xD;
sober face.&#xD;
"Not quite. I am glad it is over, though."&#xD;
Dr. Mattoon's say-so finished it, and Orchis was dis-&#xD;
missed from the presence of the august body, with the&#xD;
important bit of paper in her pocket.&#xD;
As Teacher Plmikett's school was the only one Orchis&#xD;
knew about, of course she unconsciously modelled her idea&#xD;
of her teaching upon his, and she expected to seat herself&#xD;
in state and call up her classes in order. She had bright&#xD;
visions of them, looking so well in position, while she read:&#xD;
the essays (a little twinge with the thought of her theme,&#xD;
so ridiculed), and she really got quite enthusiastic' over her&#xD;
plans, and she and Candace commenced sketbing out&#xD;
some small drawings for "rewards of merit," and making&#xD;
a list of the tunes they used to sing.&#xD;
" There s 'Dinna forget, laddie; dinna forget,' "sug-&#xD;
gested Candace.&#xD;
"Leave .that out," replied Orchis, straightening herself&#xD;
proudly while a faintblush crept up to her forehead. "I&#xD;
feel ever so old, Candace dear; I have lived so long since&#xD;
last spring, when you went to Sister Polly's. I am going to&#xD;
try teaching to fill my thoughts, as much as for the first&#xD;
object I had in view: I do not want to loiter or think.&#xD;
I will tell you something, Pet. I wonder how you can&#xD;
be so gay in this sorrowful world, when I hear your sweet&#xD;
laughter-ringing out so silver clear in our old rooms, your&#xD;
liquid song-notes merrier than the bobolink in the meadow,&#xD;
and see you romping with Ajax; I wonder at you. Life&#xD;
seems heavier with Olytie so strange, and this false man&#xD;
here. She is farther away from us than ever. Don't cry,&#xD;
Pet; I love you gay and cheery. I would love myself so&#xD;
if I could bel it. You have got a friend who may be al-&#xD;

ways a friend; I hope so truly. I had one ; I lost him.&#xD;
Shall never have another."&#xD;
This was the most Orchis ever said on the subject of&#xD;
her feelings, but Candace knew all about them; she watched&#xD;
her going through her preparations, always kind and help-&#xD;
ful, but with an old, quiet gravity, which even she felt&#xD;
too old in her sister. She knew also she had hidden out&#xD;
of sight every book, every faded flower, every bit of rib-&#xD;
bon Preeious had touched; and when she watched her&#xD;
walking listlessly up and down the garden-paths, with her&#xD;
small hands clasped and her eyes fixed on the ground,&#xD;
she knew that she was digging a grave in her heart to&#xD;
bury in it any memory of the friend so friendly.&#xD;
The strange events transpiring in the house brought&#xD;
the children closer in union. Vashti returned to her col-&#xD;
lege at the end of her vacation, and Griselda, though she&#xD;
kept a sisterly thought for the younger ones, was busy&#xD;
among her duties; and to Clytie they were as if they&#xD;
were not.&#xD;
Mr. Precious Plunkett was gone. He had met Candace&#xD;
on the street, and bidden her good-by, but sent no message&#xD;
to Orchis, and no mention was made of his return. He&#xD;
was working for himself in the city.&#xD;
One day Augusta Blossom came up full of a new plan,&#xD;
which she hurriedly brought out, and which filled Can-&#xD;
dace with wonder, it was so startling. She was going into&#xD;
Cherry Brook village to board and attend school at the&#xD;
Young Ladies' Seminary, and she wanted Candace to go&#xD;
also. Goody Ruddock was the first one consulted on the&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
Would you like to go, bairnie?" was her question.&#xD;
"Indeed I should like it rarely, Goody. Could I, do&#xD;
you think? ,,&#xD;
&#xD;
ORCL9S TRIES SjIOOL-KEEPING.&#xD;
In course you could, baby; what should hinder? there' -&#xD;
money enough. You can do all that yon lass can, if only&#xD;
some kind body would stand beside ye."&#xD;
"Then P1 ask Griselda right off."&#xD;
Before Orchis entered on her new duties her pet was&#xD;
settled ina nice, pretty room with her friend;-in the small&#xD;
world so full cif life and enjoyment, which she took "up&#xD;
with all her might. It was alittle lonely for poor Orchis,&#xD;
but she made no moan over it, bearing it, as she did all&#xD;
imevitables, with quiet strength.&#xD;
When she walked into the school-room on the appointed&#xD;
day, and surveyed the fifty faces collected there, and&#xD;
heard the uproar the fifty throats  ere pouring forth&#xD;
and which scarcely subsided at he coming ; when she&#xD;
met the curious.and somewhat defint glances cast upon&#xD;
her by the big boys, she began to be a little fluried,&#xD;
and took off her, gloves, and hung -up her bonnet under&#xD;
the blaze of fifty pairs of eyes with outward calm but ii-&#xD;
ner trepidation.&#xD;
She had never entered tge place since the "last day,"&#xD;
when she had refused the prize ; and a flood of memories&#xD;
rushed over her as she looked at the familiar benches and&#xD;
black-boards, and her eyes would seek out a particular&#xD;
desk, and a little sob gathered in her white throat. She&#xD;
had sat there through many pleasant mornings doing her&#xD;
German with her friend.&#xD;
Something crunibled beneath her touch as she lifted&#xD;
the lid of the official desk, and pushed about the loose&#xD;
papers left there by her predecessor. Could it be? Yes&#xD;
it was a bunch of faded buds, one of her despised gifts to&#xD;
Teacher Plunkett. She picked them up, and threw them&#xD;
into the waste-paper basket, and said.in a clear voice, as&#xD;
she rang the bell:&#xD;

&#xD;
My scholars will please ,be seated."&#xD;
The spirit of the request' was so ladylike, and the,&#xD;
crushed thought she- rejected gave it such firmness, that&#xD;
even the roughest subsided into their. places, and sat&#xD;
quietly while she read a few verses from the Bible, before&#xD;
she kneeled down to go through the required prayer,&#xD;
which she had taken care to learn by heart.&#xD;
Unfortunately the act of kneeling hid her from view ;&#xD;
and being all unused to offering petitions in the hearing&#xD;
of any but her Maker, her voice was low and tremulous;&#xD;
and the charm of her agreeable presence broken.&#xD;
Rude noises of all sorts began to be audible : whisper-&#xD;
sings,laughing, coughing, and scraping of feet: till at last&#xD;
a big boy, red-headed, freckled, scrawny, loose-jointed,&#xD;
lumbering, uncanny, the terror of all the ladies who un-&#xD;
dertook the summer school except Long Jane, who had'&#xD;
beaten him almost to jelly on one occasion, and stood a'&#xD;
lawsuit about it, and gained the case. This boy, named&#xD;
Philomen, began to crow ; one of his imitators, taking&#xD;
courage, newed like a cat ; another replied in a small,&#xD;
wee voice, saying, "My cat's got a kitten ;" and then&#xD;
followed a general giggle.&#xD;
A dread sense of responsibility settled upon Orchis,&#xD;
which she did not understand how- to meet. Ignorant of -&#xD;
the ways of children in general, and finding in herself&#xD;
no power to rule these tricksy spirits, she would have&#xD;
seized her sun bonnet and escaped, if she had fol&#xD;
lowed her first .impulse; but she was in for it now, she'&#xD;
could not go back. The tumult subsided a little when,&#xD;
she stood before her desk, though one of them said to-_&#xD;
'Philomen:&#xD;
"What pretty lar she's got, hain't shell"&#xD;
"She' better look sharp, or she'll get it pulled; L ain't&#xD;
&#xD;
agoin' to be ordered round by no such little hen as she is.&#xD;
Bad enough to be bossed by a big woman like Long Jane.&#xD;
She needn't try any of her 'you shalls' and 'shan'ts.' i&#xD;
can lick her as easy as that," snapping hip nasty fin-&#xD;
gers.&#xD;
When Orchis took her paper and pencil, and proceeded&#xD;
to register the names, she paused before Philomen, and as&#xD;
she did so, she thought what sort of a soul that must be,&#xD;
which could be at home in such a revolting body, and&#xD;
wondered if any woman in the world could possibly love&#xD;
such an ugly creature.&#xD;
Perhaps her reflections reflected in her face, for he&#xD;
glared viciously at her, as drawing his =hand across his&#xD;
nose, his bold eyes offered an unpleasant suggestion of&#xD;
the sort of manhood he was likely to be, father to, the&#xD;
scapegrace of the town. When people saw him slouching&#xD;
along the road, they called in their pet dogs, and little&#xD;
girls ran for their kittens ; the vagrant pigs knew his&#xD;
shambling figure, and they scurried everywhere out of his&#xD;
reach, with their tails twisted into bow-knots, as.soon as&#xD;
they caught sight of him.&#xD;
"Will you please pocket your jack-knife, Philomen, and&#xD;
tell me what you wish to study " said Orchis.&#xD;
He had commenced to whittle as soon as she approached,&#xD;
and when she spoke to him, he obeyed in a careless, im-&#xD;
pudent way, which said plainly, "I wouldn't if I hadn't:&#xD;
a mind to, and you couldn't make me," and he answered&#xD;
her guite bluntly:&#xD;
" Nothin'," at which all the boys tittered again.&#xD;
"But I suppose it will be necessary for you to study&#xD;
something, if you come to school," she added, quietly look-&#xD;
ing him over.&#xD;
" I'm coming' anyhow, and I shan't study nothin' if I&#xD;

ain't a mind fo. I don't do nothing' I don't want to,&#xD;
never."&#xD;
After this lavish expenditure of negatives, he straight-&#xD;
ened himself and glared at her, while the whole school&#xD;
looked on, measuring the strength of the two, and looking&#xD;
forward to a "muss."&#xD;
Orchis passed on, much perplexed; here was a bar to&#xD;
progress she had not expected. Instinctively her thoughts&#xD;
flew to Teacher Plunkett, and his opening speech, "If&#xD;
you want to have a row to begin with ;" but she did not&#xD;
want to have a row, could not have a row ;'the idea that&#xD;
she might be obliged to use force with this repulsive rep-&#xD;
robate, to touch him with her hands, presented itself un-&#xD;
pleasantly.&#xD;
The one model she knew, had once or twice in his term&#xD;
been through a process which he described as "sprouting&#xD;
a boy," but as it was done out of school-hours, in secrecy&#xD;
and seclusion, she had no clear idea of the proceeding.&#xD;
She and Candace had been much whipped, and she had a&#xD;
fixed determination never to inflict such pain on another&#xD;
body; as hers had suffered, though she had never flinched&#xD;
nor remonstrated.,&#xD;
There were some odd occurrences occasionally, which&#xD;
would have afforded mirth to Candace, but which scarcely&#xD;
brought a passing smile to vexed Orchis; as, for instance,&#xD;
a promising scholar in "Wattson the mind," being asked,&#xD;
" For what was the sixteenth century noted ?" replied by&#xD;
Tote:     '&#xD;
" For the reformation from Pop," the rest of the word&#xD;
being on the next leaf, she had taken the statement as it&#xD;
stood, and so Popery was only a dead letter to her, which&#xD;
perhaps.was just as well.  Also, in the reading-class, a&#xD;
girl came on a long word which was too mighty for her&#xD;
&#xD;
pronouncing ability ; hey neighbor nudged her with this'&#xD;
advice:&#xD;
"Call it tater, Sue, and let it go." The advice being'&#xD;
taken, of course the scholars laughed, if the teacher did&#xD;
not.&#xD;
The most perplexing and nyortifying session, was per-&#xD;
haps one afternoon when Esquire Redmond and Cynthia&#xD;
came to visit the school. Philomen originated a new di-&#xD;
version for the occasion, which sorely tried poor Orchis,&#xD;
weary and fagged before.&#xD;
Coaxing one, of the small boys who sat on the low bench&#xD;
in front of him to stoop forward to pick up a button, or&#xD;
other. tempting bait, he launched him with a dexterous&#xD;
kick in the middle of the floor. Half a dozen times the&#xD;
prank was repeated when the teacher's, back was turned,&#xD;
so that she could get noinformation as to the cause of the&#xD;
fun, the victims standing in abject fear of their bully.&#xD;
Attention to classes amidst such an under-current of&#xD;
worry required more poise than heading an army, and&#xD;
when the session was over, and she sat wearily at her desk,&#xD;
to listen to the shout and horrid rout of Philornen jump-&#xD;
ig on the benches followed by his squad ; hustling the&#xD;
little girls, knocking off caps, and deporting himself like&#xD;
the nasty wretch he was, she considered anew what she&#xD;
could do. He was larger and stronger than she was; 'he&#xD;
had given out his boast that "he would worry up the old&#xD;
maid, and serve her right, for daring to set herself over&#xD;
him." It is quite likely that her fine, delicate beauty&#xD;
made him feel how coarse and brutal he was. At any rate&#xD;
the boy's wish to plague the school-ma'am had settled in-&#xD;
to something like spiteful hate in sweet Philomen's ten-&#xD;
der mind.&#xD;
Esquire Redmond told Orchis "-she. must keep order&#xD;

somehow," and pointed out the most efficacious mode he&#xD;
knew of-" a good whaling."&#xD;
When the boys seated themselves on a neighboring&#xD;
fence, and sang and hooted in at the windows, and the&#xD;
girls looked at her as if she ought to quell the outrage, she&#xD;
grew pale. She felt that her first launch into life's duties&#xD;
was a-failure ; that she was incapable, good-for-nothing.&#xD;
She wondered how anybody could enjoy teaching; and if&#xD;
Teacher Plunkett told the truth when he said he did.&#xD;
That thought she directly put down, however, as unworthy.&#xD;
ie always told the truth. She began to consider boys as&#xD;
monsters without souls, sent to afflict and torment all well-&#xD;
disposed people, and she looked out on the distant woods,&#xD;
envying the squirrels who lived there and ate beach-nuts.&#xD;
Philomen laughed in her face, and snapped his fingers&#xD;
when she appealed to his honor; his honor required that&#xD;
he should worry out the school-ma'am.&#xD;
As the heavy weeks wore on, Orchis grew haggard and&#xD;
wan. Griselda noticed it. Candace, home for her Satur-&#xD;
day holiday, felt sad about it, and Goody plied her with&#xD;
dainties she had no heart to eat.&#xD;
"You' are working too herd; you will wear yourself&#xD;
out before fairly in harness," said Dr. Mattoon; "take it&#xD;
easier."&#xD;
The only way to take it easy Orchis could see, was to run&#xD;
away, and that was impossible ; so she fared on. Had it&#xD;
not been for one bright ,spot, one agreeable half hour, I&#xD;
think she must have given up in despair. She had a class&#xD;
in German, a couple of girls who eagerly caught at her&#xD;
offer to teach what she had acquired.&#xD;
Stopping one night after school to go over the lesson&#xD;
she had a thoroughly good time, and when it was over,&#xD;
and they were ready to go home, chatting, bright, de-&#xD;
&#xD;
lighted with each other, they found themselves barricaded&#xD;
by huge logs. piled against the door. The noise and&#xD;
racket without, were sp much a matter of course, that&#xD;
Orchis paid no heed to it, and with the door securely&#xD;
locked, had abandoned herself to the full pleasure of her&#xD;
one bit of good teaching. At her vain attempts to get&#xD;
free, Philomen demonically shouted, standing aloof with&#xD;
his hands crammed in his pockets, and stamping and&#xD;
squealing could faintly testify his delight when his prison-&#xD;
ers climbed through the window. The indignant pupils&#xD;
cried out against him:&#xD;
"Are you not ashamed to treat -Miss Dunwreath so&#xD;
shamefully ? horrid boy!"&#xD;
,They put their safety in peril by their championship.&#xD;
For the dear lad jammed his hat over his ears, clenched&#xD;
his teeth, and took after them with such foul language as&#xD;
made them fly swiftly beyond his reach and the sound of&#xD;
his curses. Monday morning was a white time in Orchis'&#xD;
calendar; .and the school was tolerably quiet and comfort-&#xD;
able. Philomen was kept at home, to turn the washing-&#xD;
imachine, by his mother. Ali! if the turning could have&#xD;
been prolonged like Ixion's!&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
HUNTING AND WAITING.&#xD;
&#xD;
LYTIE ! only Olytie! His soul was full of her.&#xD;
When she appeared before him, she but offered&#xD;
palpably to his senses the vision of which he&#xD;
was constantly dreaming.&#xD;
She had on a hunting-suit of Lincoln green, a short,&#xD;
full petticoat and close-fitting body, and a round cap of&#xD;
grass velvet on her head, beneath which her flaxen hair&#xD;
lay like floss silk;' Hung around her neck by a; green&#xD;
nord was a tasselled powder-flask, and her supple, slender&#xD;
wigt was belted by a russet baldrick, covered with gilded&#xD;
characters, pendent from which was a shot-pouch em-&#xD;
broidered in bead-work. Her stockings :-were clocked&#xD;
with crimson, and her trim-fitting little shoes had such&#xD;
stout soles that she could ford the shallow brooklets in&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
She stood with head thrown back and shoulders&#xD;
riolhtened, and smiled at him as he lay half-reclining&#xD;
a couch.&#xD;
"Look, Apollo ! how does your sunship like the poor&#xD;
water-nymph now?   See, she turns and turns no longer&#xD;
fr-a ray of your heavenly fire, but is sufficient to herself&#xD;
to-day. She is Diana now; she goes where she lists;&#xD;
she hunts such game as she likes."&#xD;
&#xD;
While she talked she walked easily up and down be-&#xD;
fore him, so that the bewitching grace of her appearance&#xD;
came fully to view, from the dainty pompon in her cap,&#xD;
the color of the fern-leaf, to her delicate round ankle.&#xD;
"Better as the free hunter than the poor, despised,.&#xD;
patient thing, always neglected, longing and praying for&#xD;
smiles which were not hers. But that is a lesson which&#xD;
takes time and weeping to learn well. I believe silly&#xD;
Clytie herself got weary of the life at last, and took con'&#xD;
solation in admiring her lovely face in the dew-drops.&#xD;
Now what would you give to come out with me for a long&#xD;
breezy tramp through the spicy woods? The dogwrood&#xD;
is abloom, and the rock columbine, and the yellow sand&#xD;
is purpled with the vivid blue of the wild lupines; the&#xD;
eglantines are ready to burst their pink buds; the nests&#xD;
in the deep woods are full of young birds, and the bobo-&#xD;
link is floating in song above the meadows, golden with&#xD;
crowfoot and king-cups; the moss on the great rocks in&#xD;
the brook is green, green; the world is full of life and&#xD;
love and song. Come, what would you give :' 'The&#xD;
poor maimed sun-god, lying there pale, shorn of his&#xD;
strength, faded from his regal beauty, wan, helpless!:&#xD;
"Do not mock me ! do not taunt me with my weakness.&#xD;
0 Clytie, how beautiful you are! how lovely, beautiful!&#xD;
Won't you kiss me, Clytie? just once before you go, beo&#xD;
fore you take my joyaway? What torture to feel cooped&#xD;
here like a sick chicken, alone, while you are a broad at&#xD;
your own free wilL.. I know how you go swiftly through&#xD;
the forests ; how you pause and pluck your flowers, idly-&#xD;
charming, superbly vital, every way sumptuously, glor-&#xD;
iously beautiful. I think of it here in this dull room;&#xD;
it gnaws my very heart that I must miss .such joy as I&#xD;
know of abroad with you. Won't you kiss me, Clytie?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"What! in my character of chaste Diana?" answered&#xD;
she, laughing, and coming so close that he caught the&#xD;
breath of the moss-buds and violets at her breast. "Of&#xD;
course not, Donald; it would be out of my part; and you&#xD;
know when I assume a role I must keep to it. Stay I let&#xD;
me freshen your pillows a little; your face 'is weary&#xD;
and troubled, your cheeks are hollow; I must not forget&#xD;
that I am nurse as well as huntress; Miss Nightingale as&#xD;
well as pure Diana. Odd, is it not? the mixed shapes and&#xD;
shifting changes of our poor lives; to-day, something;&#xD;
to-morrow, nothing."&#xD;
Hgfollowed every graceful motion, while she chatted,&#xD;
bending over him just out of reach; every curve of her&#xD;
humid lips; hanging on her words, drinking in her beau-&#xD;
ties, intoxicated with her presence.&#xD;
"I am going to the long beaches to hunt some squirrels&#xD;
for your supper. Say 'Thank you, Olytie."'&#xD;
"'Will you go alone to that far-off place?  Some evil&#xD;
may reach you; some danger hurt you. Wait a little&#xD;
till-I can accompany you; till I can shield you, take care&#xD;
of you. Nay, you shall not leave me to fret and fret&#xD;
awaythe weary hours."&#xD;
"fHow, delightful to be so missed! so enveloped in the&#xD;
wishes of tender thoughts, manly anxieties ! full of throb-&#xD;
bing fears, anxious presentiments! I could fancy myself'&#xD;
a -clinging vine clasping the lordly oak. Nothing will&#xD;
hurt me, Donald; nothing in the world can hui-t me, I&#xD;
think; on the contrary, I shall hurt the squirrels. I shall&#xD;
fetch home a round dozen in this beautiful pouch of&#xD;
manila grass. I'll show you their pretty heads through&#xD;
its meshes when I come in, their bright eyes glazed, their&#xD;
nimble legs broken, their fluttering hearts stilled.- I&#xD;
shall cook them for youi supper. They love their wild, gay&#xD;
&#xD;
life; I shall take what they love for you. I will kill&#xD;
them quickly; I'll not make them suffer long torments;&#xD;
to sear the brain, dry the blood, quench. the eyes in bitter&#xD;
weeping. Those are only for human souls."'&#xD;
"'Yes, for me, Clytie ! Bow you torture me ; you have&#xD;
-   no pity."&#xD;
Clytie laughed: clear, ringing music, but terrible to&#xD;
hear. Donald shuddered faintly, feeling a chilly tremor&#xD;
through all his sensitive organization, and his strange eyes,&#xD;
languid, lustrous, fastened upon her beautiful face; a&#xD;
delicate rose dyed his cheeks, and the great artery in his&#xD;
throat swelled and throbbed.&#xD;
Goody Ruddock, passing the door, stopped an instant&#xD;
to listen, as if forgetting her purpose of motion, and as&#xD;
she listened, a thought of crime passed through her mind:&#xD;
a vision of her handsome, wicked brother, and the swift&#xD;
murder she would do if she came hand to hand with his&#xD;
betrayer.&#xD;
"Wish 'me. luck, Goody," said Clytie, "'before I go to&#xD;
play at the pretty game of killing the innocent, this rare&#xD;
day of'sunshine and sweet south wind."&#xD;
"Don't leave me; don't talk so, Clytie. Put away your&#xD;
gun, and come and read ' Endymion.' Let me touch your&#xD;
hand just once,, then, that I may have the thrill to dream&#xD;
over when I am alone: your firm, warm hand like fine&#xD;
velvet." He reached out toward her imploringly : "Oh,&#xD;
how cruel ! you will never come near me ; you.who know&#xD;
so many dear caresses. Will you keep always aloof, and&#xD;
I prisoned here?$ Give me the bud I saw you holding&#xD;
between your bright lips, so like rose-leaves, just now&#xD;
biting it with your sharp, white teeth. Do kiss me, Cly-&#xD;
tie!"&#xD;
"No, sir ! chaste Diana does not kiss Apolloi the poor&#xD;

HUNTING AND WAiTING.&#xD;
&#xD;
nymph, the sun-flower, has forgotten how.  To-night,&#xD;
perhaps, when I come back and get into my costume as&#xD;
pretty waitress, I may take on the manners with the&#xD;
garb. I shall serve you by lamplight in a dainty apron&#xD;
and frilled cap; I shall put the faint blue you like upon&#xD;
it for ribbons, the Venus brooch of azure porcelain, and&#xD;
the red rose-buds at my throat.  Oh yes! 1' must be&#xD;
brave in attire, sweet in smiles, while you sup off my&#xD;
--game well-browied in sherry."&#xD;
" oClytie ! how bewildering, how  tantalizing you&#xD;
are !" moaned Donald, throwing himself back among his&#xD;
pillows. "If you had not~bid me awake from my dream,&#xD;
if you had not nursed me so kindly, I should be afraid-.&#xD;
nay, of what?2 I know not, my goddess Olytie:&#xD;
'Through light and shadow thou dost range&#xD;
Sudden glances sweet and strange,&#xD;
Delicious sprites and darling angers&#xD;
And airy forms of flitting change.'&#xD;
"Hence false doubts ! distracting fears! Here stands&#xD;
my darling in her sweet, precious womanhood. I will be&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
' When you have finished your soliloquy, magnificent&#xD;
Apollo, I will take leave," said Olytie,.pausing in smiling&#xD;
ease.&#xD;
"Go, then, and leave me to my pains, my loneliness, the&#xD;
impatience and unrest which torment me like fiends;&#xD;
maimed, helpless, broken.  Go quickly! and. let me&#xD;
dream of you, joyous, complacent, and tender, as I know&#xD;
you at your best. Ah, if tears of blood might wash the&#xD;
past! if I could but feel that she had forgotten! One&#xD;
bath in tethe!"&#xD;
"Apollo weeps," said she, returning;." there's luxury'&#xD;
in tears: Rest and sleep now for the banquet; so orders&#xD;
&#xD;
your surgeon: 'The patient must be kept quiet.' I obey.&#xD;
When I return I will bring you trophies. Au revoir,&#xD;
Donald."&#xD;
The huntress left the sick-room and walked on with a'&#xD;
free step toward the beeches. Her rosy, humid lips&#xD;
pressed.each other close, end her inky brows almost met&#xD;
with the dark frown which contracted them.&#xD;
As she passed the snake-fence, which separated the long.&#xD;
meadow from Baiquither, she came upon Blush and Can-&#xD;
dace, who were enjoying their Saturday holiday in their&#xD;
own way, strolling about, chatting, and getting pleasure&#xD;
out of all things. Just now they were occupied with the&#xD;
hopes and disappointments of a hog who was doing his&#xD;
best to find a way into the clover.&#xD;
Goody Ruddock ,had that morning mended a  break&#xD;
in the fence with a huge knee of , oak, which, though&#xD;
sound and available at surface, was hollow within, and&#xD;
large enough to permit piggie to pass through it like a&#xD;
tunnel. As the two ends were outside, and the vertex of&#xD;
the angle within, he entered with a grunt of satisfaction;&#xD;
and coming out at home again insteadyof among the liv-&#xD;
ing green he longed for, he looked about and said " Woof!"&#xD;
which was a grunt of wonder and disgust. His persever-&#xD;
ance was worthy of success, for he seemed always full of&#xD;
expectant hope with every fresh essay,. and his jubilant&#xD;
"Woof " on his going in, and his disconslate "Woof "'on&#xD;
coming out were so expressive of his emotions: his studies,&#xD;
mud-colored studies they might be called,-with his snout&#xD;
to the ground, and his white eyes winking their sparse&#xD;
lashes, his renewed pluck with every fresh go were- so&#xD;
funny, that the young folks had not thought of being'&#xD;
tired of watching him. But piggie retired from his ca-&#xD;
reer ; he voted the tunnel a fraud, and, selecting an easy-&#xD;

HUNTING AND WAITING.-&#xD;
&#xD;
looking corner, patiently cast up a rooted way for himself&#xD;
under a rail, and came out woofing and triumphant, after&#xD;
the first little fit of sneezing-that was the dirt up his nose,&#xD;
soon got rid of ; a mere bagatelle; the tatters in the bain.&#xD;
ner; the foam on the winning charger.&#xD;
Alas! poor piggie! his exultation was short. He had&#xD;
not chewed his first cud of stolen sweets, when aJ sharp&#xD;
click cleft the air, and a whizzing pistol-ball dropped him&#xD;
in his tracks, "dead, my lords and gentlemen."&#xD;
Returning the Derringer to her belt, Clytie the Huntress&#xD;
picked up her gun and stepped straight on her way. The&#xD;
two young people drew closer together, and neither spoke&#xD;
while she was in sight.&#xD;
"What is she ? " whispered Blush, who, it must be&#xD;
owned, had not quite his usual ruddy color.'&#xD;
"She is Olytie!" replied Candace, looking after her;&#xD;
" that explains all."&#xD;
While the sun was golden in the west Diana returned,&#xD;
unsoiled, unwearied, with light footfall, and stood by the&#xD;
sick man's couch.&#xD;
" See-!" said she, "the spoils of the wood I have&#xD;
brought you."&#xD;
She pulled -from the manila pouch, whose pale yellow&#xD;
fringe looked so pretty over her green habit, a couple of&#xD;
woodcocks and half a dozen squirrels, which she spread&#xD;
out before him.&#xD;
"I have defied the.game-laws for your fake, and it is a&#xD;
pity, too, I have such infinite respect for law."&#xD;
Donald had picked up a bird, and was admiring it, as&#xD;
it lay still and limp in his hand.&#xD;
"Do you. always kill your game, Clytie ?" he "asked,&#xD;
passing his fingers over its brown plumage.&#xD;
" Yes, always," she replied.&#xD;
&#xD;
HUNTING AND WAITING.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Why, what a marvel is here!" he exclaimed  "you&#xD;
have barked the woodcock. There is not a feather turned,&#xD;
not a wound, no stain of blood! only old woodsmen are&#xD;
ambitious enough to attempt that sort of killing. I am a&#xD;
decent shot myself; but I never could do it; my hand is&#xD;
not steady enough, my eyes lack truth; they play me false&#xD;
in the very moment of fate."&#xD;
"Your handsome eyes, Donald! You mean your eyes,&#xD;
not your heart. Your courage never falters, your failures&#xD;
are born of mortal weakness, imperfect senses."&#xD;
"My eyes, yes !" he said, half impatiently ; "the blue&#xD;
and the yellow, they hinder a perfect aim. I understand&#xD;
the theory of the craft you 'have conquered, if I cannot&#xD;
practise it. You aim a couple of inches below the game,&#xD;
and stun it dead, and so no tearing, no disfigurement.&#xD;
Am I not right, Clytie?"&#xD;
"And a merciful way to murder, is it not? No marks&#xD;
of violence, no trace of suffering on your victims. There'&#xD;
are men who might take lessons from me."&#xD;
"But who taught you, Clytie? I am amazed! such a&#xD;
fine, feminine, dainty girl! Oh, I remember your father&#xD;
had wondrous skill in woodcraft. I feel a dissonance, a&#xD;
jarring. Clytie, couldn't you paint game-pieces, sketch&#xD;
views, color flowers, and leave the hunting to men-to me?"&#xD;
His head was bent, and his attention divided between&#xD;
the bird on his hand and thaÂ±~aiap~4&#xD;
so that he did not know the effect of his words' on the&#xD;
huntress by his side. Perhaps it would have been better,&#xD;
if he had seen her face.&#xD;
A deep crimson flooded it, and her intense eyes seemed&#xD;
"to shoot sparks at him; her red lips drew back, showing&#xD;
her white teeth, which grated sharply together. It was&#xD;
only a point of time, a breath, and again she was as pale&#xD;

as marble. She turnedand walked swiftly to the window;&#xD;
when he next spoke she came batik, and answered him&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
"One day you will leave off barking the birds, I believe;&#xD;
Clytie, you will pouch no more trophies."&#xD;
"Withotit doubt, Donald, because one day I shall have&#xD;
killed the fated prey."&#xD;
Her voice had so hard, metallic a ring, low as were the&#xD;
'tones, that it jarred upon his highly sensitive nerves like&#xD;
an electric shock. He laid the bird out of his hand, and&#xD;
again a slight shiver passed over him.&#xD;
"If I were superstitious," said he dreamily, " I should&#xD;
tell you at this instant some one has passed over your&#xD;
grave, Clytie, and trodden also upon my heart. I feel a&#xD;
sharp wound here;" he placed his finger upon his heart;&#xD;
"a mortal pang. I shall get my death-blow right here !&#xD;
I wonder when ! I wonder how! You will not inflict it,&#xD;
my beautiful goddess, because you draw no blood, and&#xD;
my heart is beating only for you. Your love will save&#xD;
and keep me. I shall live in your sunshine ; I shall die&#xD;
looking in your dear eyes---"&#xD;
"What are you saying, Donald? you murmur so sleep-&#xD;
ily that I feel no lot in: your talk. Come, awake ! think&#xD;
of the supper ! of the pretty waiter-girl you are to have!"&#xD;
"I think only of you, Olytie, now and always."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
PUILOMEN's DOG CCBOASTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
CRISIS was approaching in Orchis' school-keep-&#xD;
ing: Phulomen the Brave was nearly ready to play&#xD;
his last 'card, just such a dirty card as a black-&#xD;
guard like him might be expected to bring out.&#xD;
The morning session was- about half 'over, when he&#xD;
shambled into the room, followed by half a dozen boys,&#xD;
whom he had kept playing truant, and at his heels his big&#xD;
dog Boaster.&#xD;
Orchis knew the brute well; he was as ungainly and&#xD;
ugly as his cub of a master, and bore as evil a name. He&#xD;
was what might be called a composite dog, having the&#xD;
wide, bandy legs of a bull, the long, thin, sneaking head&#xD;
of a greyhound, the slim, hind quarters of a black-and&#xD;
tan, and the size of a mastiff.&#xD;
Orchis watched the doings of the boisterous hookeys, so&#xD;
evidently bent on mischief. They all faced her, with&#xD;
their backs to the desks, and laughed and whispered au-&#xD;
daciously in her face, while the huge brute squatted, loll-&#xD;
ing, at his owner's feet, ready for anything.&#xD;
"We have already curs enough without that one, Phil-&#xD;
omen ; therefore open thee door and turn him out."&#xD;
"lHe's goin' to be a scholar," replied Philomen, while&#xD;
the others all laughed aloud.&#xD;

856P     PHILMEN'S DOG "BOASTER."&#xD;
&#xD;
"On many accounts I should prefer him to you, Philo.-&#xD;
men; but as my engagement only includes ,two-legged&#xD;
puppies, I do not feel at liberty to undertake his educa-&#xD;
tion ; therefore I tell you again to turn him out."&#xD;
"I tell you I shan't ! Now what have you got to say&#xD;
about it?&#xD;
"I- shall send for the trustees, and have you expelled,"&#xD;
replied Orchis, whose face was very pale.&#xD;
"Haw, haw, haw ! that is a good one ! Send away ! As&#xD;
if I cared'a button for the trustees, or you either!"&#xD;
Jimmy Whittimore, go and tell Esquire Redmond I&#xD;
wish to see him immediately."&#xD;
"You set still, Jimmy Whit, unless you want to lay&#xD;
flat!"&#xD;
Pretty Philomen. glanced triumphantly at the school-.&#xD;
ma'am ;. and the boy, knowing what kicks and cuffs and&#xD;
ill-usage he would get if he obliged her, remained in his&#xD;
place..&#xD;
Orchis' trial had culminated:, she must conquer now&#xD;
or be driven out in disgrace. She was not afraid of dogs&#xD;
a general, and very fond indeed of some at home as sav-&#xD;
age as bears to strangers, but that was in the line of their&#xD;
watch-duty ; this brute inspired her with disgust as a&#xD;
monster.&#xD;
The room was very still as she stepped slowly to the.&#xD;
door, which she flung wide open.&#xD;
"Go t" said she ; her voice was low and clear, and the&#xD;
animal felt minded to obey its power. He took in his&#xD;
tongue, and twisted his head uneasily, rolling his red&#xD;
eyes and growling.&#xD;
" Stop, Boaster ! " said Philomen, patting his head.&#xD;
"Yop see he don't stir for you. He hates old maids like&#xD;
pizen; he bites 'em. I hate 'em too."&#xD;
&#xD;
"  Go!" said she again, stamping her foot, while a faint&#xD;
col6r crept up in her hueless face.&#xD;
The scholars watched in breathless suspense ; even&#xD;
Philomen's toadies began to wish they were well out of&#xD;
the fracas. Egged. on by his master, the dog growled&#xD;
and stood up, ready to spring at the frail, slender girl,&#xD;
who looked steadily at him, pointing to the door.&#xD;
"He'll bite you, Miss Dunwreath!". exclaimed one of&#xD;
the boys; "call him off, Phil!"&#xD;
Orchis looked about her for a means of defence. A&#xD;
broom stood in a corner ; she snatched it up, and lifted&#xD;
it for a stroke, while the dog followed warily all her&#xD;
motions. From puppyhood he had known the use of&#xD;
a broomstick as an engine of wrath ; wielded by the arm&#xD;
of Philomen's mamma, he had'felt it often; and as early&#xD;
lessons are hard to forget, Boaster ignominiously deserted&#xD;
his master, hung his tail, and sneaked out.&#xD;
Thus unexpectedly cut short in the fun he had vain-&#xD;
gloriously promised his followers, Philomen sprang up in&#xD;
shouting rage ; drawing out his jack-knife and clicking it&#xD;
open, he rushed at Orchis, looking about. as'fiendish and&#xD;
nasty-wicked as "a soaring human boy" could.: She&#xD;
raised her small hand and bade him keep off, but she re-&#xD;
treated not a step. With Olytie's pistol and Clytie's skill&#xD;
Philomen would have been in danger, but she was weap-&#xD;
onless, defenceless, a slight young creature, and the knife&#xD;
was ugly and sharp.&#xD;
" Take that, old maid !" roared Philomen, as he aimed a&#xD;
headlong blow at her beautiful face. His partial mother&#xD;
would have been rather ashamed of her offspring if she&#xD;
had seen the brute devil on him at that moment.&#xD;
A vigorous grasp on his roundabout sent, him spinning&#xD;
across the floor, twirling round and round like ateetotum,&#xD;

&#xD;
till he finally landed jinder a desk in the corner, but too&#xD;
late to prevent an ugly gash across Orchis' round fingers.&#xD;
He did not stop long in covert either, for a vigorous kick&#xD;
hunted him out and ejected him from the premises. As&#xD;
soon as he collected his senses and felt safe he set up a&#xD;
howl, running hatless down the road. "Murder ! mur-&#xD;
der ! The schoolhna'am's ben a-killin' me !"&#xD;
"I hope you are not hurt, Miss Orchis," said a familiar&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The pluck and courage which had carried her through&#xD;
the unpleasantness and the danger deserted her as soon&#xD;
as the good, strong, hearty accents greeted her ears; and&#xD;
Orchis threi herself upon the nearest bench, and, cover-&#xD;
ing her face with her hands, she burst into a passion of&#xD;
tears.-&#xD;
"You shall suffer no further annoyance from  the&#xD;
scapegrace, I promise you. Pray, compose yourself ; don't&#xD;
cry. Jingo peltus !-no, not thatof course. I didn't sup-&#xD;
pose you could sob like that ; you distress me, indeed you&#xD;
do. What shall I do to make you quit it! Pll thrash the&#xD;
whole caboodle! I'll keep the school .myself!. There!&#xD;
that's right, now you feel better. Come, scholars, we'll.&#xD;
have a general exercise on the black-board; let me see&#xD;
how much of my teaching has dropped into good ground,&#xD;
and how much has been foully plucked up. Now, then,&#xD;
attention!"&#xD;
Slipping back to her. arm-chair, Orphis dried her eyes&#xD;
and listened to him, and watched him, and thought about&#xD;
him: of all his kindness and unkindness; of the help and&#xD;
strength he had been to her, and the dreary loneliness he&#xD;
had left to her when he turned his. face away from her.&#xD;
Suchan excellent friend as he was; such an only, never to&#xD;
be forgotten, never to be replaced ; herfirst aid her hast.&#xD;

PIIILOfEN'S DOG "BOASTER."&#xD;
She did not. need to explain the scene of the. morning;&#xD;
he guessed the whole from the climax at which he had&#xD;
assisted. The. uproarious state of the school .had got&#xD;
noised abroad, and had reached the ears of the newly-&#xD;
elected county superintendent, who was called, by virtue&#xD;
of his office, to give it his special attention. And .I&#xD;
couldn't undertake to say that Mr. Plunkett did not also&#xD;
indulge a hope of speaking a word for himself ; at any&#xD;
rate, he was glad to be again near the only girl he had&#xD;

Deserted, and put out of countenance by Philomen's&#xD;
downfall, the scholars attended to their lessons in quiet&#xD;
until the session was closed, in order andstillness beauti-&#xD;
ful to behold.&#xD;
When the last pupil had departed, Orchis shut the&#xD;
door and stood among the bits of paper, old pens, and&#xD;
rubbish, the accumulation of many sweepings from the&#xD;
school-house. The rough wind blew back her hat, and.&#xD;
lifted her soft hair from her forehead, but still she stood&#xD;
with the great rusty key in her fingers; for Precious&#xD;
Plunkett, the friend she had found and lost, was at her&#xD;
elbow, waiting for her to look at him.&#xD;
"Miss Orchis, are you still, determined to like me no&#xD;
more ?&#xD;
She pushed about the dead leaves with her foot, but&#xD;
did not lift her eyes (she had no idea how beautiful she&#xD;
was thus; how admirable her clear-cut features; how&#xD;
ripe-red her lips; how exquisite the dark fringe of her&#xD;
eyelids ; how delicate and quaint and charming every&#xD;
way) while the color mounted, a faint rose-tinge, inlier&#xD;
cheeks, and the fingers holding the rusty key trembled.&#xD;
" I am not determined not to like you, Precious," said&#xD;

she presently; "1I do like you very much indeed; I feel&#xD;
sorry you were not kinder and truer to me. I thought I&#xD;
had got a friend for my whole life. - It was a great disap-&#xD;
pointment to lose you, so great that I shall never open&#xD;
my heart to-another."&#xD;
"That's, right, Orchis, don't; but don't close it on me.&#xD;
I want to come in before the door shuts. You remem-&#xD;
ber the paring-fortune made me your sweetheart."&#xD;
"Do you wish to be my -sweetheart, Precious?" asked&#xD;
Orchis, fixing her blue eyes on his; "did you come here&#xD;
to tell me so?"&#xD;
"I came in   y    acity of superintendent to fix up&#xD;
the wretches of oys, ho I knew were plaguing your&#xD;
life out. I am g ad  came to-day; and being here, I&#xD;
ask you a plain quest' i: Will you marry a fellow who&#xD;
loves you with all his might?1 "&#xD;
"You! Precious?  do you love me that way ?"&#xD;
"I'm the very chap, Orchis. If you love me as I love&#xD;
you, then naught can break our love in two."&#xD;
"I do love you, Precious. You have been very un-&#xD;
kind, and I have been very unhappy about it. Candace&#xD;
says you could not help yourself; you had to be unpleas-&#xD;
ant because I was troublesome with my flowers. If you&#xD;
had said, 'Don't bring them, Orchis ; they are lovely; I&#xD;
like to get them ever so much ; but you see these fools&#xD;
are making fun of you,' I should have left off directly,&#xD;
and we could have gone on with the German. We might&#xD;
have got a good way farther by this time, and I should&#xD;
have been glad you were so honest and candid."&#xD;
"I wish I had, Orchis; but I had not-pluck enough.&#xD;
You would have done it in my place, I truly believe;&#xD;
but there is nobody so true and outspoken as you are;.&#xD;
that is one reason why I love you so 'eeply."&#xD;

face bright and smiling; "how small and trifling all m&#xD;
troubles seem now; I wonder I could have been so&#xD;
bothered with them."&#xD;
" I am dreadfully ashamed of myself, Orchis. I should&#xD;
like to drop out of sight somewhere. I'll never make&#xD;
you unhappy again, so help me John Rogers !-there it is&#xD;
again ! talking slang in the most interesting moment of&#xD;
my whole life; but you will not: mind the boy that will&#xD;
stick fast in spite of me. I feel so happy-you are going&#xD;
to be my wife."&#xD;
"I should like to be your sweetheart first, Precious.&#xD;
Candace is going to be sweetheart to Blush, and I should&#xD;
like to be yours."&#xD;
"Thank you, Orchis. You do say the best things ;&#xD;
and you say them so well. Now you are engaged to me,&#xD;
I am sure of you."&#xD;
" And Iam sure also, of course; what should hinder?"&#xD;
"'Dear, good sweetheart, how are the poor cut fin-&#xD;

"Not very; bad, I hope; I have them wrapped in my&#xD;

" You understand the fashion and privileges of sweet-&#xD;
hearts, don't you, OrchisV "&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
" They often kiss each other."&#xD;
." Do they ? I don't believe Candace has heard of that&#xD;
fashion. But I should like to kiss you, Precious, if you&#xD;
can feel it right for me."&#xD;
She did not retreat from his proffered caress, accepting&#xD;
it in simple faith as a sign and seal of, betrothal, saying:&#xD;
"Now my lips iare holy; my husband has touched&#xD;

Precious looked at her in devout wonder; she was so&#xD;
radiant, like a saint; so chaste, so earnest in her candid&#xD;
simplicity. Bit pretty soon the boy-fun would bubble&#xD;
up to the surface of this youthful manhood, untouched&#xD;
by care, untried by losses.&#xD;
"I suppose you know that by virtue of my new office,&#xD;
I have the right to visit all the pretty girls in the county&#xD;

"Not in the least, Precious. Why should IU What&#xD;

chose me.' You didn't choose me then, though ; I didn't&#xD;
choose you; I never had any-choice. I. saw you first of&#xD;
anybody, and I liked you always. You are mine, and I&#xD;
am yours as much as if the world held but us two."&#xD;
" Orchis ! I never saw such a girl! You are the no-&#xD;

DONALD'S FIRST WALK.&#xD;
&#xD;
'YELL and healed at last! two good legs to stand&#xD;
upon, two hands to serve me ; Richard's himself&#xD;
again! You cannot leave me to-day, and go out&#xD;
hunting by yourself, because I am able to follow you to&#xD;
the world's end. Now, Clytie, we must take the stroll&#xD;
you've promised me so long, and which I was thinking so&#xD;
much about last night that I could not sleep."&#xD;
"But, Donald, I. am afraid your new-gotten strength&#xD;
will not outlast a severe trial. It is necessary for you:to&#xD;
take care of it; you are a weakling, a flower."&#xD;
"How like a taunt your words sound. When you talk&#xD;
I shrink as if you stabbed me. I have to look in your&#xD;
serene face to feel secure in the present, and you will&#xD;
permit no reference to the dead past ; it is out of my&#xD;
reach, I cannot touch it; no pangs, no remorse will recall&#xD;
it, that I might do it better."&#xD;
"Are you speaking to me, Donald? Really I shall&#xD;
feel you rude if you choose thus to parley with yourself&#xD;
when I am present."&#xD;
"I but chided a phantom; it has fled now. Come, let's&#xD;
go. Put on your hat; Iam in a hurry to be out in the&#xD;

ay leaves flutter; I want to hear the fall of the brooklet&#xD;
over the great mossy rocks you told me of ; I want to&#xD;
know myself a new man, by my Clytie's side."&#xD;
They took the;shaded lane-path where the encroaching&#xD;
alders thrust their greenery, the sumacs already crim-&#xD;
soned, and the towering chestnuts shone golden yellow&#xD;
above their heads.&#xD;
The clear air braced Donald's nerves, colored his&#xD;
cheeks, and raised his spirits to exuberant gayety. Cly-&#xD;
tie watched him, replying to his bright pleasantries. Of&#xD;
a truth she had never seen the handsome man so hand-&#xD;
some as on this autumn evening.&#xD;
As they crossed the ford which led to Sister Polly's, he&#xD;
began td hum an old familiar air, which was all linked&#xD;
in, tone by tone, with the past in the library. He scarcely&#xD;
ever sat down at the piano in those days without produc-&#xD;
ing some of its strains. It was a part of him, of the life&#xD;
that was wrecked: "I have lost my Eurydice."&#xD;
Clytie put her hand to the pistol in her belt with a&#xD;
quick motion, and as quickly removed it, locking her&#xD;
fingers in a fast clasp as she did so. The rocks were&#xD;
slippery with green slime, and Donald missed his footing,&#xD;
and so plashed the water upon Clytie's skirt.&#xD;
"Fatal mishap !" said he, "which does wrong to my&#xD;
goddess; stay till I cleanse out my fault."&#xD;
He drew forth his handkerchief, and, kneeling on the&#xD;
turf, he laid the edge of her robe upon his knee 'and&#xD;
erased the soil, looking -onstantly up into the face above&#xD;
him as a devotee adores his saint.&#xD;
"Now am I forgiven-?" asked he, rising.&#xD;
"Forgiven !"repeated Olytie, slowly lifting her fringed&#xD;
lids, and showing a strange glitter in the inky blackness&#xD;
of her great orbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
DONALD'S FIRST~ WAL.1JF&#xD;
"Do you not understand the word'?" replied he gayly.&#xD;
"This is the attitude of a penitent," dropping upon his&#xD;
knees and folding his pahmstogether.&#xD;
"You are wasting precious time," she answered slowly,&#xD;
looking at him askance. "Men should stand erect; pick&#xD;
up your poor mouchoir and let's walk on."&#xD;
Springing to his feet, he dashed his handkerchief from&#xD;
his hand with the petulant grace of a pampered child.&#xD;
"You delight to vex me! but to-day you shall not sue-"'&#xD;
ceed. I have come out for pleasure ; you shall not damp&#xD;
it. Come, Clytie, do smile and be kind. AhI never&#xD;
were such smiles as Clytie's, never ! never ! Thpy light up&#xD;
my deepest soul! they kindle all my being into fire !"&#xD;
They had passed but a few steps on their way, when&#xD;
Mark Munson crawled out from among the bushes; and&#xD;
.picking up the despised handkerchief, he spelled out the&#xD;
name in the corner, "Donald McQueen;" and after&#xD;
wiping his red-rimmed eyes on it, he stood, half-bent,&#xD;
looking after the two with a strange, mean, malicious&#xD;
grin on his weazened. face, before he slouched off towards&#xD;
the deep wood.&#xD;
At the foot of a great oak the pair sat down to rest;&#xD;
Donald gathered the golden leaves and wove a chaplet;&#xD;
which he dropped upon the high crown of Clytie's straw&#xD;
hat, standing before and admiring her beneath it. "Lus-&#xD;
trous sweet !" he murmured. "Now will you kiss me,&#xD;
Clytie "&#xD;
" No, not here in the dim woods, solemn and still; this&#xD;
is a place to think of the lost ; the dead in their graves;&#xD;
the spirits who watch us. Sunshine and briglhess are for&#xD;
caresses."&#xD;
"ILet us go quickly, then, where~it is most radiant. .You&#xD;

you would not come near me. Oh how coaxing, how&#xD;
provoking you were in that cunning little cap ! how-&#xD;
the dainty apron became you! I shall never forget you&#xD;
as you looked that night. You have shown yourself to&#xD;
me so many Clyties, that it seems all charms, all beauties,&#xD;
all graces blend in you, most rare and wondrous one.&#xD;
There! looknow! you are like an Alsatian reaper in that&#xD;
braided straw; the masters never painted such a face ; the&#xD;
whole world holds but one Clytie. Come,-hasten out of this&#xD;
shadow. Ugh! the wind feels chilly ; I do not like it ; nor&#xD;
the wail up there among the branches; nor the screaming&#xD;
of the crow; nor the singing of the whippoorwill. I crave&#xD;
warmth and cheer."&#xD;
"Stay! see that bird over yonder on the larch! Shall I&#xD;
drop. him for you before he fills his throat with song&#xD;
again?"&#xD;
"4No, no! do not stop his joyous life ; wherefore should&#xD;
you?$ Not to vaunt your skill: that I know already; not for&#xD;
the pleasure of killing,: that were unwomanly, cruel; my&#xD;
Clytie can be neither. I would shower blessings on all&#xD;
creatures this first day of my freedom ; besides, my god-&#xD;
dess, you promised me to leave off hunting."'&#xD;
"Yes, Donald, but not. yet; there are evil things that&#xD;
must die: poisonous reptiles, dangerous beasts, whom&#xD;
my good gun shall takecare of. I must rid the world of&#xD;
hateful monsters, cowardly wretches-"&#xD;
"Don't talk like that, Clytie ; don't look like a priest-&#xD;
ess ready to slay the sacrifice; you make me feel as if I&#xD;
were the victim."&#xD;

"I IAVE LOST MY E  RYDICE."&#xD;
&#xD;
GODY RUDDOOK had been hard at work all&#xD;
day; a task had been set her, and it was accom-&#xD;
plished in full: she had reproduced the old li-&#xD;
brary, from the gold and crimson paper on the wall; to&#xD;
the foot-rests and cushions on the familiar carpet; there&#xD;
was Clytie's picture in bridal robes hanging in its place;&#xD;
there the piano in its corner; there the great eaky-chair;&#xD;
the cases filled with books. Every flower-vase, every&#xD;
bracket, every fire-screen, each bit of crystal, 6f virtue,&#xD;
and keepsake, each memento in its own nook.&#xD;
It might have been yesterday that Clytie listened there&#xD;
to her young lover's music in rapt delight, an hour ago&#xD;
that he praised her loveliness and chided the tardy hours&#xD;
that kept them asunder.  The whole place was storied&#xD;
with the youth and joy and glory of her girl-life, misty&#xD;
with her dreams and hopes.&#xD;
Although the sun rides high, the room is shadowed by&#xD;
its heavy crimson curtains draped into gloom; the light of&#xD;
garish day excluded, and a flood of yellow radiance, soft&#xD;
and mellow, beams from the student lamp on the table:&#xD;
the same lamp at which the two friends read, the lovers&#xD;
sat, dreaming and silent, drinking ecstatic draughts of&#xD;
bliss from each other's presence.&#xD;

"I HAVE 4OT MY EURYDICE."&#xD;
Hl ere comes Olytie, robed in azure crape, with the lace&#xD;
d rkhief knotted at the back, and the narrow snood keep-&#xD;
ing in place her flaxen, flossy hair, and the moss-buds at&#xD;
her throat; the Clytie-of years ago, in outward seeming:&#xD;
slender, erect, serene ; but not the same Clytie. This&#xD;
scornful gloom; those inky brows drawn together in a'&#xD;
dangerous frown ; those set lips ! No one ever saw ths&#xD;
Clytie in the old library, where the father read to them&#xD;
In cosey comfort, the sisters chatted, and the elder one&#xD;
guided and helped all from her rich capacities, which ac-&#xD;
knowledged no lack.&#xD;
On the threshold she paused, sweeping the room with&#xD;
her black eyes, while a spasm of pain contracted her fea-&#xD;
tures, blanching them to the hue of pale marble. Advanc-&#xD;
ing with slow steps, she took down a painted vase on a&#xD;
standard of gilded braiding :' a pretty, porcelain thing,&#xD;
having for its ornament a girl's head, with such bright&#xD;
lips, such aureate locks as Olytie's: and filled it with the&#xD;
tube-roses and geraniums, she had just fetched from her&#xD;
grave beneath the wailing pines. She leisurely arranged&#xD;
her odoi-ous sweets; but exquisite in perfection as she&#xD;
looked, her action was not that of a flower-lover arranging&#xD;
her favorites; a lady decking her retreat to her dainty&#xD;
liking. When, having finished, she knelt, with her gaze&#xD;
fastened upon the Clytie bride above her, and her small&#xD;
hands clasping close the costly medallion, which she wore&#xD;
suspended from her neck, enclosing her father's head set&#xD;
in jewels, Olytiminesti'a would have suited her better than -&#xD;
the patient sunflower praying for grace and pity.&#xD;
She is waiting for the bundle of manly beauty and manly&#xD;
consummateness, and is restless amid her surroundings.&#xD;
The pretty wood-lire sparkles and danceson the hearth,and&#xD;

door, and, after gazing in troubled amaze at the well-&#xD;
remembered objects, dreamily approached the piano,&#xD;
and dropping his fingers upon the keys, finally began&#xD;
grouping the chords, and playing half strains of airs, look-&#xD;
iug at the Clytie on the wall, thinking of the real Olytie;&#xD;
of the past, of the present, of the future. Unconsciously&#xD;
he caught the theme he had struck that last evening of&#xD;
his betrothal. A soft rustle in the dusky room, lighted&#xD;
only by the fire-shine, and peopled with shadows, caused&#xD;
him to turn his head, and find the lady of his thoughts&#xD;
close to his shoulder, as she had stood that night when he&#xD;
had ceased his music to lift his hands to hers, and say&#xD;
"O Olytie, how I love you ! " His attitude and look were&#xD;
precisely the same.&#xD;
"Clytie, tell me something which I must ask, and&#xD;
which it makes me tremble to speak; there lies such an&#xD;
ocean of happiness beyond your answer."~&#xD;
She turned her vivid gaze full upon him ; he was much&#xD;
agitated; a sort of shimmer of love and joy illumined his&#xD;
handsome features, glowed in his strange, eloquent; lus-&#xD;
trous .eyes.&#xD;
" Is tliere anything in which the nurse has failedL the&#xD;

"Don't laugh, Olytie! you are too beautiful; I have&#xD;
seen you look as you look now, to the tiniest bud at your&#xD;
throat, the softest fold of your dress. Everything here is&#xD;
sweet with the wondrous charm of my darling; then,&#xD;

"When I am no longer Clytie Dunwreath, and you no&#xD;
more Donald McQueen!"&#xD;
"Clytie, how pale you are ! how your eyes flash! how&#xD;
terrible is your face ! Don't look like that, sweet, dear&#xD;
Clytde!"&#xD;
"Sweet to you! dear to you! And who are you ? "&#xD;
"Donald : your betrothed once, your lover always ! "&#xD;
"I have no lover. I had a betrothed ; he left me to go&#xD;
to Europe."&#xD;
" But I have come back to make it right between us !&#xD;
to beg you to forgive the past; to let me love you."'&#xD;
"Love !"  It was but one word, but enough to make&#xD;
him hide his face; such a clear, hard, ringing tone, such&#xD;
cold, pitiless blazing eyes.&#xD;
"O  Clytie," said he in a low voice, "is it -possible&#xD;
that you hate me ! have hated me all this bounteous sum-&#xD;
mer, when you have been so royal in goodness, so rich in&#xD;
charms ; and I have been so happy to be attended by&#xD;
your care, fed by your smiles, healed by your sunshine ?"&#xD;
latee ! I don't know that. I love no more since my&#xD;
father was made to suffer unjustly, done to death by cruel&#xD;
men, and no one came to pity him or me. I think my&#xD;
soul died with him, is buried yonder in his coffin."&#xD;
"0 Clytie, don't say that ! pity me!"&#xD;
"Pity you! Donald McQueen.! Ipity you, who caused&#xD;
me to live for five years behind these walls which were my&#xD;
priso , a life so full of weariness and silence that I won-&#xD;
der I  dnot go mad ! so full of horror that nothing hel4&#xD;

So fresh, so beautiful; indeed. I find in you numberless&#xD;
graces I had not dreamed of. In this lonely seclusion&#xD;
like Arcadia, a rhythm of delights, a piquant, provoking&#xD;
brightness and sparkle, a bewitchment which intoxicates.&#xD;
Oh no-! not that face! that is the seeming of a cruel de-&#xD;
mon, who charms to destroy; show me only the face of&#xD;
my goddess who smiles ; full of variety; who speaks wit;&#xD;
who laughs music. Clytie, you did love me ; you do love&#xD;
me!&#xD;
"I remember a sweet spring evening, when I stood be-&#xD;
fore you in bridal robes. There! look! that is the girl I&#xD;
was " (pointing to the picture on the wall, which a burst-&#xD;
ing flame lighted into brightness); "the world was as&#xD;
kind to me as paradise to Eve. I loved then, God knows&#xD;
how well; I had better cause to learn how illl! I had lav-&#xD;

you, Donald McQueen, had kept close by my side through&#xD;

I wanted friendship, my help when I craved succor, this -&#xD;
heart should have beaten only for you in every pulse!,all&#xD;
thoughts, all wishes should have centred in you, through&#xD;
evil or good, till death, after death, if it had pleased God&#xD;
to graht me such happiness!"&#xD;
"Oh, forgive me, Clytie ! I was weak ; I shrank from&#xD;
the taint; from the scandal; I could not bear to be pointed&#xD;
at, gazed at, pitied. I felt then that I was disgracing&#xD;
my manhood; proving myself a coward. I feel it now&#xD;
afresh, and oh how bitterly ! I wish Icould have a chance&#xD;
to undo the past! I wish there was any sacrifice I could;&#xD;
make to cancel the fault. A 'good, long life is still ours.&#xD;

lie lifted his hands .to his ears to shut out her ringing&#xD;
voice, and bent his head low; as if her words wounded.&#xD;

never releasing him for an instant from the intense gaze&#xD;
of her black, black eyes.&#xD;
"Tell me," asked he softly, after a little, without mov-&#xD;

"fThat you might feel the fullest value of what you cast&#xD;
aside as worthless. I would not have you leave me a&#xD;

While he passed from her sight she stood motionless,&#xD;
the flickering flame lighting her features, making her&#xD;
a statue of retribution among the shadows of the be-&#xD;

saw how the sunshine bathed himP in its ruddy splendor&#xD;
when he gently pulled open the door. God's justice is&#xD;
over all; 'she drank up the last longing, pleading, mourn-&#xD;

tains into hers. He walked slowly down the steps, and&#xD;
. out among the flowers; she heard his footfalls over the&#xD;
gravel; she knew, though she no longer saw him, how&#xD;
handsome he was, how gentle, how cultured, how ex-&#xD;
quisitely toned to all sweetness, all refined pleasures;&#xD;
how dearly he loved her; how sincerely he repented.&#xD;
For one instant his words, musical, tender, loaded with&#xD;
woe, sounded again upon her quivering sense: "God shall&#xD;
judge between us; " and she felt as she had felt years&#xD;
before, when to have been his wife would have been as&#xD;
much bliss at her soul could hold.&#xD;
She took no note of time; she had not moved- or&#xD;
dropped her eyes; but after' a while a door opening&#xD;
behind her with a heavy clang, roused her so muchsthat&#xD;
she felt it necessary to shift her place, to go out beneath&#xD;
the open sky, where there was more light, more breath;&#xD;
more room.&#xD;
She walked on a good way, and sat down under the&#xD;
firey maples on the bank, and the sweet ferns she&#xD;

&#xD;
crushed under her feet sent her a waft of their -spicery.&#xD;
The great crimson ball of a sun, which was hanging in&#xD;
the west, looked at her through the purple haze of the&#xD;
Indian summer, and the cumulous clouds glowed into&#xD;
rosy glory which enveloped her like a veil. .She pulled&#xD;
toward her a stalk of asclepias, and idly opening the ripened&#xD;
pods,: she plucked, thence the shining chestnut cones of&#xD;
seeds, and tearing them asunder, she scattered them one&#xD;
by one, and watched them sailing on -their silken, flossy&#xD;
wings before the warm   south wind. His voice still&#xD;
sounded in her ears: "Forgive me, Clytie: I was weak;&#xD;
you are cruel !"&#xD;
She looked down at two great round drops which fell&#xD;
from her burning eyes upon her hand.&#xD;
" What ! " said she wonderingly, "tears from my eyes,&#xD;
which had forgotten how to weep! God knows I am&#xD;
but a woman, a feeble woman ; I suffer still. Come, let&#xD;
me hasten before my strength is weakness, before I have&#xD;
broken my vow."&#xD;
She ran hurriedly to her grave under tlge wailing pines,&#xD;
and threw herself upon the sod.&#xD;
"Father, I am here; it was but a moment's faltering,&#xD;
a moment's longing. He loved me so much,! I am still&#xD;
so young ! It has passed now ; I am thy faithful Clytie,&#xD;
strong to do thy bidding. Do not despise me."&#xD;
When she rose to her. feet, the chill and death in life&#xD;
of her marble seeming had returned; and so much did&#xD;
she feel herself gone back to her still self, that she threw&#xD;
away the graceful dress, the azure crape so praised, so ad-&#xD;
mired, the ribbons; the draping shawl, tore the buds from&#xD;
her hair; thrusting them into the storied library, she locked&#xD;
the door upon. them and it, and resumed the checked&#xD;
homespun in which she had toiled and suffered in silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
The heavy nigh hung drearily over her world, but the&#xD;
moon was up, and she felt the house too narrow; the wide&#xD;
earth was but. a prison of horrors, the wealth and glory&#xD;
of it dead.  "I was weak, but you are cruel."  She&#xD;
sought the deep wood-coverts; wandering aimlessly on,&#xD;
she fell into the footpath she and Donald had taken the&#xD;
.day of their long walk, she neared the tree beneath which&#xD;
they had rested when he had woven the oaken chaplet;&#xD;
she vaguely wished to pause there just a moment, but a&#xD;
low sob caught her ear, a crouching figure met her peering&#xD;
eyes. Yes, it was Donald, his face in his hands, his whole&#xD;
frame convulsed with bitter weeping.&#xD;
" Donald, I am here ; Clytie is close'to you."&#xD;
Had the whisper found breath? No, she clutched fast&#xD;
her throat, she kept it back, and turning softly, she re-&#xD;
'traced her steps to the open fields. As she was crossing&#xD;
a stile, she saw two men, who were going home from&#xD;
Cherry Brook; their heads were close together, looking&#xD;
at an object one held in his palm.&#xD;
" How light th noon is," said he; "look ! I dan read&#xD;
the hour. So much for a white-faced watch; just eleven&#xD;
o'clock." Putting up the time-keeper, they continued&#xD;
their way and left her again alone.&#xD;

GRANNY MUNSON'S MONEY-BAG. &#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
&#xD;
GRANNY MUNSON'S MONEY-BAG.&#xD;
HEN Donald bade farewell to his love, and left&#xD;
his crushed hopes at her feet, he walked on and&#xD;
on, stopping sometimes to lean against a wall&#xD;
and think, if it could be called thought when all his&#xD;
being was blurred, clouded, darkened. He crossed the&#xD;
pond, and kneeling on the bank, he pulled out his hand-&#xD;
kerchief; and as h cleansed a fancied spot from the hem&#xD;
of a robe he held upon his knee, he looked upward, talk-&#xD;
ing to the Clytie of his dream..&#xD;
Then the sin went down in the west, and it grew dark.&#xD;
Away in the distance he saw a light; he bent his steps&#xD;
toward it. He was sensible of no fatigue, but a light&#xD;
suggested shelter and warmth ; and he needed both, for his&#xD;
pulse beat feebly, and his very bones were chilled; so he&#xD;
approached- it. Before he reached the place, he heard&#xD;
without heeding, muffled screams and curses. They were&#xD;
nothing to him; the whole earth was reeking with&#xD;
blood, drenched in sorrow. He quickened not his pace.&#xD;
But a man, small, bent, weazened, rushing swiftly from&#xD;
the room, overthrew him upon the turf ; he was not&#xD;
angry; but flurried and disturbed. He rose, staggering,&#xD;
to his feet. His hat had fallen and lay upon the grass; he&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
did not stoop to lift it, did not notice its loss. There was&#xD;
a cut on his head from the edge of, the old scraper at the&#xD;
door-stone, which soon matted his curls with blood and&#xD;
crimsoned his white collar.  Something, not fear, caused&#xD;
him to leave the light he had approached, and turn back&#xD;
into the wood. He recrossed the ford, delicately picking&#xD;
his way over the mossy stones. Utterly weary at last, he&#xD;
sat down under a tree., A plaited garland of gay leaves&#xD;
lay at his feet. He saw it, picked it up, and pressing his&#xD;
lips upon it, he hid his face in his arms and convulsively&#xD;
wept. That storm passed, though, after awhile; all emo-&#xD;
tions were. wasted; and feeling cold and miserable, he&#xD;
crouched closer in a heaj, not desiring to move; as well&#xD;
there as anywhere. But at the first touch .of a human&#xD;
hand he sprang to his feet enraged, alert, dangerous.&#xD;
"Kitch holt of him, till he tells what he is a-doing in&#xD;
the woods this time o' night, Jim," said a thick voice.-&#xD;
"I.illo I what's this?"&#xD;
As they struggled with their prisoner, a handkerchief,&#xD;
knotted, and holding a bag full of coins, had been kicked&#xD;
loose from its hiding under the leaves at the tree-foot, and&#xD;
Jim picked it up. As he did so, the bag slipped out and&#xD;
dropped, and he set his foot upon it.&#xD;
"Hold round your lantern, Dan, till we look." He&#xD;
spelled out the name in the corner of the delicate cambric,&#xD;
"Donald MeQucen." "We've got him! we've got him !&#xD;
there's the very booty !" He raised and clinked the money&#xD;
triumphantly before their eyes.&#xD;
" So you are the thief, are you! Well, you ain't a keen&#xD;
one; why didn't you toddle with the blunt ? Vamose the&#xD;
ranch! iillo! he's all blood. Ugh! The old woman's&#xD;
reek, I s'pose, the murdering fool I"&#xD;
As he reached out pointing to the stains on Donald's&#xD;

face, a blow of the accused's right arm dropped him like&#xD;
lead, and it took a sharp tussle for the two to pinion and&#xD;
drag him away.&#xD;
Mark Munson, who had been skulking behind a fallen&#xD;
oak ever since Donald sat down, slunk out when the&#xD;
coast was clear and the sound of their voices was dimmed&#xD;
by distance, wiping his red-rimm d eyes on the back&#xD;
of his hand, peering and groping among the debris at&#xD;
tree-foot.&#xD;
"Yes, they've got it sure-ly, damn 'em! I ought to&#xD;
covered it deeper, but the ninny came along and made me&#xD;
hide. Well, 'tis in his own wife. How lucky ! as good as&#xD;
a verdict . He's fit for hanging anyhow ; a meaner scamp&#xD;
nor me: I never had his chance for a beautiful young&#xD;
wife, and turned my back on her. He'll swing sure, and&#xD;
I'll go and see the fun. Damn the old woman ! how&#xD;
hard she was to kill,--and now her money-bag's gone with&#xD;
the peelers. Well, I've got the will; i'll have the farm;&#xD;
I'll sell it. I'll cut and leave that hag down there. I hate&#xD;
her! She hides her money, I know she does; I shall choke&#xD;
her some of these days if she don't give it up. What&#xD;
the devil does she think I got tied to her for! she don't&#xD;
mend my clothes, she don't cook me anything fit to eat,&#xD;
and she hides her money; she lies and says she hain't got&#xD;
none. I'll smash up the old pianny 'fore I go; she shan't&#xD;
never t'ump out them old tunes no more. She'll be a butter-&#xD;
fly afore she knows it, maybe."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
SHUT UP IN PRISON.&#xD;
&#xD;
FOUL murder had been done, and the whole&#xD;
county was alive with it. Parties had been out&#xD;
all night beating the woods, scouring the fields&#xD;
in search of the guilty wretch.&#xD;
Poor old Granny Munson was found tied to her bed&#xD;
with her own clothes-line, her body burned to a crisp;&#xD;
her hands were stretched at her sides -and tightly&#xD;
knotted, and the rope so savagely drawn around her&#xD;
neck, that her eyes glared hideously;. and kerosene had&#xD;
been poured all over her, and scattered about the room;&#xD;
her tongue protruded from her mouth,' and was found&#xD;
fixed between her toothless gums and jammed out of all&#xD;
shape with the force they pressed upon it, and the face&#xD;
was horribly purpled-and swelled as in cases of hanging;&#xD;
the organs of her throat, and vessels-of her brain were all&#xD;
congested, showing not only that the poor old creature,&#xD;
whose palsied helplessness ought to have protrected her,'&#xD;
had not been burned to death, but that slow torture had&#xD;
been her portion before life was extinct.&#xD;
Aunt Ann had been the first to hear the noise; Sister&#xD;
Polly and her husband being absent, and the other&#xD;
peaceable old folk in a quiet sleep and lard to awaken.&#xD;

&#xD;
They extinguished the burning; and in looking about the&#xD;
place, had stumbled upon a very soft, fine beaver hat,&#xD;
markedly the property of a gentleman., in the crown of&#xD;
which was written a name, "DonaldiMcQueen."&#xD;
The bag of money was gone from     under the old&#xD;
cushion, and the chest beneath the bed was rifled of its&#xD;
contents. The will, mortgages, deeds, which made the&#xD;
poor crippled miser rich and miserable, were stolen, so&#xD;
that robbing was clearly the ultimate end of the ghastly&#xD;
deed. And the wretch was in custody, having been&#xD;
secured after savage resistance; and in his possession the&#xD;
missing money-bag, tied in his own handkerchief, marked&#xD;
with his name ; his linen and his clothing all bore the&#xD;
same stamp, as also his hat, found on the premises. His&#xD;
guilt and identity were so clearly established, without any&#xD;
trial, and his crime so revolting, that the officers had&#xD;
much difficulty to keep him out of the hands of the out-&#xD;
raged mob, indignant atythe base deed.&#xD;
The only brother of the deceased, who was recently&#xD;
married, was summoned to the shocking scene from his&#xD;
peaceful slumbers, and was much cut up by the tragic&#xD;
spectacle, weeping aloud and throwing himself upon his&#xD;
sister's dead body in an agony of grief, insomuch that&#xD;
he had the sympathies of all who witnessed the sad spec-&#xD;
tacle.&#xD;
This was, the newspaper account of Granny Munson's&#xD;
sudden taking off: and Donald McQueen was shut up in&#xD;
prison.&#xD;
Griselda and Orchis had each a lover. Griselda had&#xD;
lived through 'a bitter trial, where a lover had refused to&#xD;
shoulder the disgrace of his betrothed; had taken care of&#xD;
his reputation by going to Europe. Griselda lived in&#xD;
the world; she was an active worker in its needs and&#xD;
&#xD;
interests; she heard much, saw much of the poverty of&#xD;
poor human nature. Now when this news reached her,&#xD;
though it was only an inflated scandal, yet it, so far&#xD;
involved her family that she trembled.. Only just out&#xD;
of the old calamity,,how could she be certain of the man&#xD;
she wished to marry i Her soul was knit to his by this&#xD;
time, her life bound up in his. If Dr. Mattoon played&#xD;
the poltroon she was forever miserable.&#xD;
Orchis was calm, restful, pitying the unhappy man in&#xD;
such deep trouble, wishing with all her heart that she&#xD;
knew how to comfort Olytie; she trusted first of all in the&#xD;
comfort and peace, in the strength and love of the good&#xD;
boy, whose sweetheart she was so happy in being.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
GOODY RUDDOCK MAKES A SENSATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
EOPLE flocked to the court-room. The day of the&#xD;
trial had arrived; Donald McQueen stood in the&#xD;
prisoner's dock to answer for his life. The first&#xD;
face'upon which his look lighted, in its sweeping search&#xD;
of the humanity gazing at him, was Glytie's. She had a&#xD;
place exactly fronting him, where he could not choose&#xD;
but dwell upon her features so white, so marble-still, so&#xD;
passionless in their cold repose; the agony of his shameful&#xD;
state was heightened a thousand-fold by her presence.&#xD;
When he rose to plead, he leaned forward, pouring the&#xD;
eloquence of his wonderful lustrous eyes full into hers,&#xD;
which sent it back, black, deep, pitiless-&#xD;
"NOT GUILTY."&#xD;
The jurors looked at him, some of them with the evil&#xD;
glance which common, inferior men often cast upon a&#xD;
consummately handsome one: His physical perfection did&#xD;
him no good office among his peers, and to the most in-&#xD;
partial observer this fine-grained delicacy and elegance&#xD;
told against him. His case was prejudged in the minds&#xD;
of all; and as the evidence unfolded, the damning name&#xD;
exhibited on the rare lawn handkerchief, his costly hat,&#xD;
dropped at the very threshold of his victim, were regarded&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

with disgust; tatters, meanness, dirt should go with such a&#xD;
crime. All faces showed horror as they turned to the&#xD;
prisoner's box; such a beautiful piece of perfection'as&#xD;
they saw to hold the soul of a base murderer. It was as&#xD;
revolting as mischievous venom in the full-cupped, glori-&#xD;
ous rose,-foul poison in the pure lily.&#xD;
As circumstantial evidence, the testimony was com-&#xD;
plete: he had been found in possession of the booty-part&#xD;
of it at least. There were papers, bonds and mortgages,&#xD;
and the old love-letters of the deceased, which had disap-&#xD;
peared ; they were believed to be hidden by the prisoner,&#xD;
and careful search was made through the wood. If he&#xD;
had lived a century before it is likely that. torture would&#xD;
have been applied to him to extort a confession. He was&#xD;
considered dangerous, having resisted his captors with&#xD;
the vigor and address of a desperate ruffian.&#xD;
The stage-driver was sworn; could only tell how he had&#xD;
ridden outside ; how chatty and pleasant he had been ;&#xD;
how he had been cast at the gate of the farm, taken in&#xD;
by the old maids.&#xD;
Then Clytie was called. She stepped forward quietly,&#xD;
holding the shaker bonnet she removed from her head, as&#xD;
she did so, in her hand. A swift rustle passed over the&#xD;
court, and a whisper, " One of the old maids." She re-&#xD;
mained unmoved, and gave her answers to the questions&#xD;
in a clear voice, without even aflutter of shyness or em-&#xD;
barrassment.&#xD;
" The man came, maimed, helpless, to my house. I at-&#xD;
tended him through his illness. Then, cured, he left me."&#xD;
4 When did he leave your house?"&#xD;
"Friday evening, the 20th of October."&#xD;
"Why did he leave you on that particular day?"&#xD;
"He was cured, and had no longer need to stay."&#xD;
&#xD;

GOODY RUDDOG 1(A KS A SENSATION.&#xD;
Where did he go?"&#xD;
"I do not know."&#xD;
"Had you formed no friendship for the man who owed&#xD;
you his life?"&#xD;
"Not the slightest. I never make friends.'&#xD;
"Did he pay you for taking care of him?"&#xD;
"No;,I did not heal him for money; he never offered&#xD;
it,"&#xD;
So secluded was the interior of the farm,. that nothing&#xD;
was known of the past of the two, and the unrevealing&#xD;
face of the witness gave no insight into the present-&#xD;
Of course curious eyes, following his longing looks at her,&#xD;
discerned the deep interest he manifested, but it proved&#xD;
nothing. Olytie testified that the prisoner never left the&#xD;
house, after he was brought into' it, except for exercise,&#xD;
when she attended him. No glimmer of light was thrown&#xD;
upon the case by her evidence, and she returned to her&#xD;
place ; and her still demeanor, when dismissed, proved&#xD;
her either unconscious or regardless of the interest and&#xD;
curiosity she had excited.&#xD;
The atrocious cruelty of the deed, its sickening details,&#xD;
were dwelt upo nand intensified, till' all minds were in-&#xD;
flamed against the fastidious gentleman who could calmly&#xD;
plan and coolly execute so beastly a crime. They looked&#xD;
at his white hands, which had tied the death-knots, stretch-&#xD;
ing deliberately the wrinkled arms into place, pinioning&#xD;
them carefully, saturating the body with the inflammable&#xD;
oil which was to disfigure"the remains, and destroy his&#xD;
victim; and so bitter were the rabble, that there arose a&#xD;
movement .among them to take the law into their own&#xD;
hands: the riotous mob who are often zealous to do jus-&#xD;
tice upon crimes which have not yet found them out-.&#xD;
While the lawyers talked and the trial proceeded, the&#xD;

&#xD;
weary thoughts of the prisoner went over his life with&#xD;
the woman before him; her beauty and grace and bright-&#xD;
ness, and the sparkling looks she knew how to give,&#xD;
while the saddest last, days in jail dropped from his&#xD;
memory. lie was sick with yearning; -be felt, with a sob,&#xD;
that he would gladly bear the odious ending of his mor-&#xD;
tality which stared him in the face, for one short year of&#xD;
life in her oppulent love; and the confused sounds of&#xD;
the stifling court-room, where every one of his delicate&#xD;
senses were offended, died into far-off dimness as his free&#xD;
soul strayed in pleasant places ; no shadow between them ;&#xD;
she all hid very own, his adorable Clytie ! rich in graces,&#xD;
bounteous in a thousand sweets.&#xD;
As the days passed, and. each morning brought him&#xD;
again to the box of shame, he sought her eagerly ; and&#xD;
finding her in. her place, he recommenced his pain, his&#xD;
longing,.his despair.&#xD;
When at last they could no longer drag out the agony&#xD;
of the wretch who was foredoomed in the convictions of&#xD;
all, they roused him to ask him if he had anything to say&#xD;
why sentence of death should not be passed upon him.&#xD;
He only stretched out his hands to Clytie in voiceless&#xD;
agony. She remained mute and motionless, while he was&#xD;
manacled and taken back to his cell, and her eyes followed&#xD;
him to the door; her last 1V4 fell, like ice upon his&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
No sooner was he gone, than Clytie's vision wandered.&#xD;
With the vivid recollection of that other trial, which&#xD;
was ever present with her; waking and sleeping, there&#xD;
came always a small man, meagre, sordid, mean, in gray&#xD;
clothes, who sat crouching, with his chin in his hand,&#xD;
away in a far, obscure corner.&#xD;
Her eyes searched him often in these last days against&#xD;

her will, as ift he was part and parcel of all shameful&#xD;
scenes; once she had found him watching, his lanky, faded&#xD;
hair, his grimy, bony knuckles, his discolored teeti and&#xD;
scrubby beard, even the untidy k h  Qf a red silk scarf he&#xD;
wore twisted around his skinny throat, the same as when&#xD;
her father was a victim.&#xD;
A slant ray of sunlight hit him, and showed him to her,&#xD;
the man of the dread trouble, the creature of hideous&#xD;
dreams.&#xD;
Once more she saw him, a witness on the stand, wiping&#xD;
his red eyes, and blinking like a mole in daylight. le&#xD;
was not able to throw any light on the case, except to&#xD;
swear that his sister had-money and bonds, which were&#xD;
gone. He was married; lived away from the village; had&#xD;
not been up to the farm for a longtime.&#xD;
While Clytie's eyes were fastened upon the fellow, on&#xD;
this last day of the trial, crouching in a corner, a sudden&#xD;
howl broke the silence of the court when all were busy&#xD;
with the appearance of the doomed.&#xD;
"1Hold him I Keep the kelpie!I the devil! till I tear&#xD;
him in pieces. He is my brother's murderer!"&#xD;
"Sit down there ! Silence the court-! Put her down!&#xD;

Goody Ruddock heeded nothing, stayed for nothing;&#xD;
her strength made her way, and she pushed on straight&#xD;
to her goal, her 'hands working and her eyes flashing,&#xD;
while her deep voice poured forth curses in the abound-&#xD;
ing consonants of her native tongue.&#xD;
The swaying crowd closed in her wake, and she found&#xD;
nothing; her enemy was gone. Clytie's nightmare also&#xD;
was vanished. Common faces, ugly faces, deformed faces&#xD;
there were in plenty, but the weazened, stunted creature&#xD;

the doomed man declared his positive intention&#xD;
to kill himself, insisting that he never would stand onthe&#xD;
scaffold, the sport and scoff of a curious crowd, enjoying&#xD;
his disgrace as a sprightly spectacle.&#xD;
"1 am not guilty of this deed," he said. "I abhor the&#xD;

being. I turn sick And faint at sight of blood ; the very&#xD;
recital of such a hateful abomination makes me ill. I tell&#xD;
you now, I will tell you with my latest breath, I am&#xD;
not guilty."  He said it to the minister; he said it to the&#xD;
sheriff. .lHe swore it with a solemn oath to a visitor he&#xD;
had in prison, one Dr. Mattoon, who made it his business&#xD;
to comfort those of his kind who were thrust outside com-&#xD;

Griselda come one day secretly, bringing dainties to&#xD;

should have been happy with Clytie to-day ; free and&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
The jailer pushed a plate of beans into the room, and&#xD;
went his way, providing in the same bounteous way for&#xD;
other criminals.&#xD;
" I cannot eat beans!"said Donald piteously; " Clytie&#xD;
cooked squirrels in wine, and brought them with her own&#xD;
hands. Ali! how lovely she looked that night ! She never&#xD;
would kiss me; she hated me. I. wish I could have known&#xD;
it at the first. She bade me wake from my dream. I did&#xD;
awake at last. This is a terrible awakening, is it not&#xD;
Grizzle? Caged here! I, who never did a wicked thing&#xD;
but one in my whole life. I begged and prayed to be&#xD;
forgiven ; I wanted to atone. What can a man do more?"&#xD;
Hiding his head in her lap, she placed her hand softly&#xD;
upon it, and while he wept, her tears.fell softly.,&#xD;
" Griselda, dear sister, will you grant ie one favor. for&#xD;
&#xD;
REFINED LIKEZi PURE GOL&#xD;
the sake of the old days, when I meant to be a good&#xD;
brother to you?" said he after the fit of passion had&#xD;
passed.&#xD;
"Yes indeed, Donald, I will do anything I can."&#xD;
"Bring Clytie here just for a farewell look."&#xD;
"I'll try, poor Donald; but I am afraid she will not&#xD;
come. She speaks to no one, is rarely seen by any; she&#xD;
spends her days alone in the wood, regardless, even of&#xD;
Goody Ruddock."&#xD;
"A visitor to the prisoners " The door was unlocked,&#xD;
and Dr. Mattoon entered, just as Gi'iselda passed out, so&#xD;
that they met on the landing.&#xD;
" You here, my Grizzle ! ma sour la bien venue, how&#xD;
glad I am! I have heard a good deal of the sad story,&#xD;
and I was hastening to-night to Cherry Brook to be near&#xD;
you. Dear girl! what a sad time it was ! and how sweet&#xD;
and true and precious you have come out of it; refined&#xD;
like pure gold. Now tell me truly, are you not right&#xD;
glad to have me for a stand-by in this trial ?"&#xD;
Those were listrous eyes which Griselda showed her&#xD;
betrothed.&#xD;
"Refined like pure gold; yes, that is true of you, and&#xD;
1 was fool enough to doubt you, to dread this revela-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Doubt me, Griselda!" he answered reproachfully.&#xD;
"If you knew the story of this poor fellow shut in&#xD;
there, and his failure, you would'not wonder, I am sure."&#xD;
"I.know it all, Griselda ;. I am not made of the sort of&#xD;
stuff which shrinks or warps. ' In six troubles I will shield&#xD;
thee, in seven I will not forsake thee.' Where do you&#xD;
go now, darling?"r                           o&#xD;

REFhNEJ) LIKE PURE GOLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
A light heart it was, which Grieslda held int her bosom,&#xD;
despite her sympathetic sorrow. One lover true.&#xD;
The next morning she went to the farm. Clytie was al-&#xD;
ready afoot, although it wasscarcely day-dawn, with her&#xD;
gun upon her shoulder.&#xD;
"Stay! Sister Clytie; I am the bearer of a message to&#xD;
you from Donald," said Griselda.&#xD;
Clytie turned 'her stony face, fixing her black eyes&#xD;
upon her sister, waiting for her to conclude.&#xD;
"lHe desires to see you, Olytie; lie begs you to come for&#xD;
a farewell. I ain sure you will not deny him in his sore&#xD;
strait."&#xD;
"A farewell word! NoI will not refuse so small a&#xD;
boon. I have it ready for sending, a proper message au-&#xD;
thorized by himself. I got it in the extremity of my need;&#xD;
I return it to him in his. May it comfort him as it con4-&#xD;
forted me."&#xD;
Disappearing within the library, she .fetched thence&#xD;
from the desk of ebony, an envelope containing a card,&#xD;
on which was written:&#xD;
"Donald McQueen.&#xD;
"Gone to Europe."&#xD;
"That is. my farewell," said she ; and shouldering her&#xD;
gun, she stepped away toward the forest.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW VINDICATED.&#xD;
HE week of torture which filtered between the&#xD;
sentence and its execution had lapsed, and the&#xD;
last night dropped its mantle over the deeds of&#xD;
all men.&#xD;
The prisoner was lying on his cot. The watchman&#xD;
looked into his cell each time he passed, obeying his stria-&#xD;
gent orders to make sure that the victim was safe and snug&#xD;
for the hanging. The whole town was full of rumors, and&#xD;
bets were freely taken upon the catastrophe, one party&#xD;
going for the condemned, who had sworn never to motion&#xD;
the scaffold, and the other taking the odds, so that the&#xD;
sheriff had reason to be unusually alert and anxious.&#xD;
Donald had refused food, but they were not too tender&#xD;
or humane to force the needed sustenance into the stonm&#xD;
ach, which must do its work during the pleasure of the&#xD;
officers; of course the wishes or inclinations of its niser-&#xD;
able owner, being .a convicted felon, had no need to be&#xD;
consulted.&#xD;
The cell had been searched every day, the body of th&#xD;
inmate carefully inspected ; and it seemed certain th4t n&#xD;
weapons, no poison could aid him to keep his vow, end&#xD;
avoid the bitter public shame.&#xD;

THE MAJESTY OF THE. L AW VINDICA TED.&#xD;
Midnight, had passed, and the guai-d began to feel&#xD;
sleepy, and cast longing looks at the bunk in the corner&#xD;
of the hall.&#xD;
What! what was that? a sob ! a groan! Unlocking&#xD;
the door, he stepped swiftly in ; the prisoner was asleep,&#xD;
breathing heavily, snoring in fact. The guard had half a&#xD;
mind to wake him up, and tell him to turn over, and quit&#xD;
that noise.&#xD;
" I won't distui'b the poor devil," muttered he. "It's&#xD;
his last sleep before the long one that never wakes ; " and&#xD;
going softly out, he continued his watch. One o'clock.&#xD;
Passing again, he paused to listen. This was no sleep; it&#xD;
was gasping agony! horrible! stifling! panting for breath!&#xD;
It might be bad dreams, though.&#xD;
Looking closer, he saw that the man's face was livid,&#xD;
his lips purple, his forehead drenched in cold sweat:; and&#xD;
tossing off the blankets, he found his hands clenched and&#xD;
his limbs drawn together as if in a fit. The felon was&#xD;
dying!     --.&#xD;
ie ran for the jailer, who flew to the shop, bringing&#xD;
the .doctor, who had slept with one eye open, ready for&#xD;
the swiftest emergency. They examined minutely the&#xD;
head, throat, and body of the prisoner, and they found a&#xD;
small puncture under the left breast, with a purple rim:&#xD;
a strangewound: He probed it, not tenderly, with his&#xD;
knife. The sufferer threw up his arms and groaned. He&#xD;
touched a wire ! The sensitive, delicate gentleman, who&#xD;
shrank from scandal, ran away from duty, abandoned his&#xD;
betrothed, wrecked two beautiful lives by his moral&#xD;
cowardice, had enough of physical courage to inflict and&#xD;
bear the torture in silence, till the body sank so far as to&#xD;
drop below the control of the soul.&#xD;
"Will he die, doctors" asked the sheriff anxiously.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MAJESTY OF THE LA W VIPNDICATED. $93&#xD;
No, not just yet, poor fool! If he had known enough&#xD;
to pull out the thing, he would have collapsed instantly.&#xD;
Luckily he didn't, and we've got him tight. Pour ddw&#xD;
the brandy quick! give him a quart if it- is necessary;&#xD;
stimulate him up anyhow!"&#xD;
Obeying these humane suggestions, they made haste to&#xD;
ply him with restoratives; and as he came back to full&#xD;
consciousness,'his agony -was so overmastering, that he&#xD;
implored them to kill him and end his pain. His livid,&#xD;
convulsed face, his leaden eyes bore witness to the ex-&#xD;
tremity of his sufferings. Instead of listening to his re&#xD;
quest, or even leaving him alone for .the few last sobs&#xD;
which might have finished him, they poured brandy and&#xD;
the like down his throat, as they had done his rejected&#xD;
food, so intensifying his vitality, and by consequence his&#xD;
pain-throbs a hundred-fold. Oh yes ! they were men of&#xD;
purpose, men of will; they were determined the felon&#xD;
should not dodge the hanging.&#xD;
In the morning, the sheriff, who was a man of bowels,&#xD;
despite his occupation, and had had enough of the horror&#xD;
to make him willing to lose his fees rather than see any&#xD;
more of it, sent a despatch to the judge,- stating the case,&#xD;
and asking for instructions. The reply soon came:&#xD;
" The majesty of the law must be vindicated; let the&#xD;
prisoner be hung at "the appointed time."&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"GOD SHALL JUDGE BETWEEN US, .LYTIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
NLY a limited number of spectators, could be ad-&#xD;
mitted to the festivity of the hanging. It was&#xD;
)&amp;amp;' with great difficulty that Clytie Dunwreath pro-&#xD;
cured a ticket; but she persevered till she touched su-&#xD;
cess, and as soon as the prison-gates were opened, she pre-&#xD;
sented herself for admittance.,&#xD;
She tried several stand-poins for a view of the gal--&#xD;
lows, and finally fixed on the most conspicuous one, and&#xD;
from which the candidate could not fail to see her the&#xD;
instant he took his place beneath the drop.&#xD;
As the yard filled with people she was rudely jostled,&#xD;
but she gave no heed, remaining motionless, pale as mar..&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
The scanty lines of her homespun dress' followed se-'&#xD;
verely the symmetry of her beautiful shape, and her small&#xD;
hands, clasped in her lap, held loosely a bunch of rose-&#xD;
buds which she had fetched from her father's grave on&#xD;
her way to the spectacle. Her shaker bonnet was pushed&#xD;
back, and her lovely head leaned against a post. Such a&#xD;
wonderful face, with its inky eyes so large, so pitiless, so&#xD;
intense ; the hueless cheeks; the drawn, livid lips, untinged&#xD;
with their proper red, the adorable lips which could be&#xD;
humid and bright and glowing in their bewitching re-&#xD;

pose. The golden, flossy hair, framing it so strangely&#xD;
floating so uncared for about it, lifted by the wind, till it&#xD;
shone and glittered in the sunshine like threads of yellow&#xD;
silk, falling where it liked in amber waves.&#xD;
A space insensibly cleared around her, as the people&#xD;
fell away from her, shunning her touch as if she had been&#xD;
a white witch, a pale ghost-; and frighted glances dwelt&#xD;
askance upon her.&#xD;
Whispered, words, scarce breathed, pronounced her&#xD;
name and coupled it with 'the defiled one soon to be&#xD;
washed in blood. Bitsof her strange story were told be-&#xD;
hind hands, drunk into eager ears, and followed by lifted&#xD;
brows and exclamations of horror.&#xD;
A young girl who waswatching her, said afterwards&#xD;
that a spasm of pain contracted the blanched face once,&#xD;
when a woman at her elbow was relating the details of&#xD;
the unfortunate man's attempt to take his life, coloring&#xD;
the story with, the most vivid loathesomeness she wasa&#xD;
mistress of. But if it were true, it passed so swiftly that it&#xD;
was scarcely visible.&#xD;
So prone is the human mind to feed on calamities, that&#xD;
I suppose not one of the spectators would have missed the&#xD;
sensation for any cause whatsoever.&#xD;
When the fatal moment arrived, and the dying wi'etch,&#xD;
exalted now into a martyr by his sufferings, was helped;&#xD;
pulled up the steps, his fast-waning strength was already-&#xD;
such faint weakness, that when he stood in the place of.&#xD;
shame, two hale fellows, who had abundant force, and&#xD;
were not sentenced to be hung, were obliged to support&#xD;
him on either side.&#xD;
Such a ghastly sight was scarce ever seen,; such ashy,&#xD;
discolored, fallen, tarnished features, such dethroned man-&#xD;
hood.&#xD;

It was worth seeing, perhaps, because this world might&#xD;
swiag on a thousand years, it may be, before another felon&#xD;
could be hung with a couple of inches of iron wire cor-&#xD;
roding in his heart. Indeed, the sheriff was fain to hasten&#xD;
his preparations, lest the abused heart should stop its&#xD;
ticking, before the dread sentence could be executed, the&#xD;
majesty of the law be vindicated.&#xD;
One minute was allotted him to speak.. With scant&#xD;
breath, but a fixed will, he forced his voice to.form the&#xD;
words; low, but pronounced in such stillness of listening,&#xD;
that all in the jail-yard caught them. His gaze was fixed&#xD;
upon Clytie, as if she were alone the auditor he desired to&#xD;
have, and all others were but dross.&#xD;
"God shall judge between us, Clytie. Dear, precious&#xD;
Clytie, farewell!"&#xD;
The inexpressible tenderness and pathos of the words,&#xD;
of the look, were never forgotten; for one instant the&#xD;
wondrous eyes were flooded with their marvellous. bright-&#xD;
ness, the handsome face regained its eloquent beauty.&#xD;
They waited breathless; but though the victim's look&#xD;
still fastened on the marble face below him, the glory&#xD;
of his manhood was gone. A glozing film obscured his&#xD;
sight, and his jaw dropped. The last sob was coming;&#xD;
the betters on the side of law were in danger of losing&#xD;
their wagers, but hate steaded them; a quick swing, a&#xD;
heavy drop, and all was over.&#xD;
With the sound of her name, every eye sought Clytie's,&#xD;
and they went out hurriedly, pushing each other roughly,&#xD;
to get first beyond the gate, willing, nay, eager, to remove&#xD;
from her neighborhood. The yard was empty ; only the&#xD;
quivering body there on the ghastly frame, and the slen-&#xD;
der woman. Still she did not stir. A jailer came, and&#xD;
touched her softly, almost fearfully, on her shoulder.- She&#xD;

gave no heed. He shook her a little, looking more closely.&#xD;
into the upturned face; taking hold of her wrists, he tried&#xD;
to unclasp her hands. They resisted his efforts; the sharp&#xD;
nails were buried deep in the tender flesh. One drop of&#xD;
blood colored her parted lips. Her heart had burst.&#xD;
Goody Ruddock, who had followed her mistress to the&#xD;
gate and hovered about, her great nature full of love and&#xD;
grief and dread, entered now by virtue of her magnetic&#xD;
womanhood, despite rules, to claim her charge. She took&#xD;
the body in her faithful arms, and as she tenderly lifted&#xD;
it, she whispered:&#xD;
"Ah! shut yer eyes, bairnie, shut yer eyes; dinna look&#xD;
up and up thus always. Ay, ye see.him still, even in&#xD;
your death-sleep. Poor heart ! ye carried it deep, deep!&#xD;
ye bore it still, making no moan. But ye're brak at last!,"&#xD;
They laid her on her own bed, and dressed her for the&#xD;
grave, but nothing they could do would close those lifted&#xD;
lids, and the wide-open eyes still gazed upward; but as&#xD;
the features settled to their last repose, the sickening look&#xD;
of tortured endurance wore off, and a peaceful rest so&#xD;
glorified her, that they fancied she might have lost sight&#xD;
of the horror which killed her, and got a glimse of the&#xD;
father she loved.&#xD;
They opened the grave beneath the wailing pines, and&#xD;
laid-her beside her martyr. "Of the worlds' ill-used are&#xD;
heaven's blessed."&#xD;

mankind they knew.&#xD;
Griselda read the prayers, Goody rounded the grave,&#xD;

Mrs. Sacrider was the victim. Ever since she had. been&#xD;
IMrs. 2Minson she had fared hard: "I'd be a butterflvy"&#xD;
and "Bonaparte's March" had failed to charm when the&#xD;
concealed wealth had not been found; the husband had&#xD;
been not- only perverse, but morose and brutal, and the&#xD;
poor, lone woman, who had.hoped to better her condition,&#xD;
heartily isLed herself back to-her old state, her pickings&#xD;
and stealigs and quiet,,once more; and she was dread-&#xD;
fully afraiC of the man whom she had persuaded to&#xD;
come home to tea.&#xD;
One morning some passers-by heard horrid screams,.&#xD;
and broke into the house by kicking down theory.&#xD;
They found the woman in a shocking state : bruised an&#xD;
mangled; her long grizzled hair, of whi~i she had ~eeV,&#xD;
so proud in. her pretty youth, strewn about the floor, and&#xD;
her flesh cut and hacked frightfully.&#xD;
As they failed to surround the, house, the wretch of a&#xD;
husband escaped through the back door, and could not be&#xD;
tracked.&#xD;
On   being  questioned, Mrs. Munson  said: "He&#xD;
threatened to kill me. He found me at his chest; I wanted&#xD;
to see the bag of money he had hidden there. He stole it&#xD;
from his sister; I know he did. He killed her; he has got&#xD;
her deeds and papers. There they are ! under the bed.&#xD;
He is the murderer, not the man who wvas hung.'&#xD;
Following her directions, they discovered and secured&#xD;
the stolen booty.&#xD;
"Let me testify, quick!" gasped she, " before I die. I&#xD;
want him to be hung! he is so wicked. He has killed&#xD;
me every pay. I hope he will go to hell! He is worse&#xD;
than the devils."&#xD;

THE HURXURDES EN1&#xD;
&#xD;
were so inflamed that his minutes would have been few&#xD;
had he been found.&#xD;
Candace stood by the farm-house window looking out.&#xD;
Blush was tabooed with the rest of the friends, and she&#xD;
was very lonely, and the days were long and dreary.&#xD;
" Come here, Goody!" exclaimed she without turning&#xD;
her head. "See ! what ails the dogs ?"&#xD;
All came quickly to the windows. There were Ajax&#xD;
and Toss, not friends in general,-making common cause&#xD;
against an enemy. Goody Ruddock opened the door and&#xD;
strode out. Pretty soon she came back, and took Clytie's&#xD;
gmi from its rack and began to load it.&#xD;
",What is the matter, Goody ?" asked all the voices.&#xD;
" My brother's devil is out there ! I shall kill him n! "&#xD;
A sort of horror seized upon them, and no one wished to&#xD;
be left indoors; they followed her, clinging to each other.&#xD;
It was Mark Munson. What strange fatality pushed&#xD;
him from one danger to another it is impossible to say. He&#xD;
had crawled through a hole which Ajax had dug that&#xD;
very morning under the fence in a hunt after a rat, and&#xD;
had sought shelter in the great hay-barn.&#xD;
The dogs held him close prisoner, and to avoid them&#xD;
he climbed the straight ladder leading to the great beam&#xD;
over the mow. He was -clinging to its rungs when Goody&#xD;
swung open the door and raised her gun.&#xD;
A dread fright seized him; he clambered to the beam,&#xD;
tottered an instant, then fell over among the hay. The bay&#xD;
was nearly empty, and Goody had left her pitchfork,&#xD;
sticking handle downward, among the feed. Even she,&#xD;
fierce, full, of revenge as she was, turned aside her eyes&#xD;
when he dropped, and a fearful scream told his state:&#xD;
the sharp tines pierced his side, and 'te spasm of agony&#xD;
caused him to vault backward over the edge of the plank&#xD;

Vashti's surgery.&#xD;
By this time all were gathered at the door, and Orchis&#xD;
called off the dogs, while Goody, having discharged her&#xD;
gun and missed her :aim through over-anxiety to hit,&#xD;
dropped the unfaithful weapon and began to climb into&#xD;
the hay.&#xD;
" Stop, Goody! what will you do?" exclaimed Griselda,&#xD;
hanging upon her arm. .&#xD;
"Kill the kelpie, as he-killed my beautiful boy!"&#xD;
"No need, Goody," said Vashti in a hushed voice.&#xD;
"He has killed himself; 'he cannot live five minutes&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
." Then 1 shall tear the flesh from his bones !" Shak-&#xD;
ing off the hold of the clinging hands, she darted upon&#xD;
the sufferer, who glared hideously at her as if he had seen&#xD;
a spirit.&#xD;
"What have you done with my Randy, you murdering&#xD;
devil  Speak quickly, before I stop your bv*th!"&#xD;
"For shame, Goody!" interrupted Yasi4Â° "Let the&#xD;
creature die in peace; torturing him won't hring back your&#xD;
lost.. Hush ! he is going to say something."&#xD;
Yashti raised hun a little and placed a wisp of hay&#xD;
under his head while she spoke, holding. off the woman&#xD;
by force of an authority she got through abounding&#xD;
love.&#xD;
It was only a sentence, the man uttered before he gave&#xD;
up the ghost. Whether it did him any good or no, on the&#xD;
other side, I cannot tell, but they all heard it, and it was&#xD;
infinite comfort to the orphans. Vashti was the one at&#xD;
whom he looked, to whom he told the truth.&#xD;

"My good Mattoon, I am glad-he will help us," added&#xD;

been broken at an opportune moment, to the Reverend Co-&#xD;
lombia, was gotten over easier than had been feared' by&#xD;
Griselda; and even the brave doctor felt a sort of sheep-&#xD;
ish relief.&#xD;
An adventurous pedler,-having stopped at the parson-&#xD;
age to sell some spectacles, had quite upset the equanimity&#xD;
of the wiry preacher by his'persistent supposition that she&#xD;
needed them.&#xD;
"I wonder who the idiot thinks there is here that is old&#xD;
enough to wear glasses ?" she said, and banged the door hi&#xD;
the face of the inmportunate vender. Excellent woman !&#xD;
acceptable pastor! she still had all the frailties and queen-&#xD;
ties of her kind. Being in this rasped state of mind, the&#xD;
doctor's news was curtly received.&#xD;
"I expected as much! Grizzle is too good for you or&#xD;
any other man, but if she can't see it in that light it is&#xD;
not my business to open her eyes. Take her, and be as&#xD;
good-to her as you can."&#xD;
Mr. Mattoon accepted the advice pleasantly, and was&#xD;

waiting the propitious hour for congratulations and cheer&#xD;
which was sure to come, when the lady got into a serener&#xD;
frame of mind.&#xD;
So in due time Griselda had her parish, and her name&#xD;
on the door-plate of her beautiful parsonage. And she&#xD;
worked like a hero in the place she planned for and&#xD;
reached. And Dr. Mattoon put his name beside the mi-&#xD;
ister's, as he had desired to do. I never heard of any&#xD;
break in their harmonious living, and I know that Stead-&#xD;
fast Goodlove invited her to the ministers' meetings in&#xD;
Peaceful Valley, where they finally settled for life.&#xD;
Vashti opened a surgery in the same charming village,&#xD;
where she "sets poor bones gratis," and does a world of&#xD;
good with the gift she got from Heaven and perfected&#xD;
with care and culture.&#xD;
Mrs. Plunkett got an excellent daughter in Orchis Dun-'&#xD;
wreath. It took a little time for' her to find out how&#xD;
good; but as the blur was wiped off the family repnta-&#xD;
tion by a certain paper Mrs. Sacrider handed over to the&#xD;
authorities, which duly proved who fired the mills, by'&#xD;
whose plan, and what was the pay for it, she could make&#xD;
no reasonable objection. And as the truth, purity, and&#xD;
single-mindedness of the young wife gradually unfolded&#xD;
to her knowledge, she thanked her only son fervently,&#xD;
for the dear child he had brought her home.&#xD;
Cynthia Redmond ran away with Alben Wragg; and&#xD;
being taken by her. worthy spouse to a dog-fight, was&#xD;
maimed for life by the fall of the staging; and thus be-'&#xD;
coming useless, she was of course deserted, and led a&#xD;
miserable life till Arabella took pity on her and gave her&#xD;
a 'quiet corner of her home-where she rears chickens&#xD;
and feods the pigs, her father refusing to have 'any cog-&#xD;
nizaiic of his-disobedient child,&#xD;

Christina grew and throve in spite of the, Hardbakes,&#xD;
and was as kind and helpful to them as they were hard&#xD;
to her. She married early,. but not a, missionary or a&#xD;
minister. A nice young husband she got among the Roses,&#xD;
Abel by name, and she promises to make a very indul-&#xD;
gent sand tender mother.&#xD;
Eflie was the only one of the Balquither sisters who&#xD;
ever took a helpmeet. Arabella often said, "I feel&#xD;
remarkably well to-day ; I refused two widower's this&#xD;
morning before breakfast."&#xD;
Candance and Blush are fast friends. She and&#xD;
Augusta Blossom, whom she loves entirely, were several&#xD;
years at Rosenbloom together, while Mr. Beach went to&#xD;
college ; but the sweetheart is not carved yet on the&#xD;
good staff which hangs over Orchis' picture in the room&#xD;
the children occupied so long at the farm; and when&#xD;
Blush adverts to it, she gives her nose a little push, and&#xD;
"Not yet; there are more on the string you foretold for&#xD;
hre that day in the lane."  I hea d, however, that the&#xD;
young lady had a glittering ring on .ier first finger, which&#xD;
I believe means as much as carving on a staff.&#xD;
None other of my ten old maids ever took mates.&#xD;
They will die in good time probably, and be gathered&#xD;
to their mothers and the rest of their. female rela&#xD;
tons.&#xD;
Dear readers, the wisdom and folly of this world is&#xD;
so mixed and mingled, and seen from such diverse&#xD;
stand-points, that it ,if hard to bring them to a common&#xD;
standard- which shall define their true quality. What is&#xD;
one man's meat is another man's poison. What is absurd&#xD;
folly to one, is sublime wisdom to his neighbor. There-&#xD;
fore I shall be obliged to leave my ten old maids in yur&#xD;
