"Through long, long years ,to seek, to strive, to yearn&#xD;
For human love,-and never quench that thirst&#xD;
To pour the soul out winning no return-&#xD;
O'er fragile idols, by delusions nursed,-&#xD;
On things that fail us, reed by reed, to lean,&#xD;
To mourn the changed, the faraway, the dead,&#xD;
To send our troubled spirits through tL unseen&#xD;
Intensely questioning for treasures fled."&#xD;

Ir is meet that those whose sympathy'has been dew and sunshine to the&#xD;
nursery' plant, should watch over its transplantation into the public garden.&#xD;
And as this Dedication is the only portion of the book which is'new to you2,&#xD;
you do not require that it should remind you of the welcome stormy evenings,&#xD;
when I laid down my pen, to read to you the chapters written since our last&#xD;
"select party ;" how the fictitious names of my real characters were house-&#xD;
hold words to our trio: and your flattering interest-grateful because sincere&#xD;
--stimulated my flagging spirits in the performance of my task. You know,&#xD;
too, what many may not believe-with what misgivings it was entered upon,&#xD;
.and prosecuted; what fears of the licensed critic's ban, and the unlicensed&#xD;
public's eneer ;-above all you comprehend the motive- that held me to the&#xD;
work-an earnest desire to contribute my mite for the promotion of the&#xD;
happiness and usefulness of my kind. Coming asitdoes from my hearte-penned&#xD;
under the shadow of our home-altar, I cannot but feel that the mission of my&#xD;
offering is to the hearts of others,-ask for it no higher place tlian the fireside&#xD;
circle. Readers and judges like yourselves, I may not, do not hope to fled;&#xD;
but I trust there are those who will pardon the lack- of artistic skill in the&#xD;
plot, or the deficiency of stirring incident, in consideration of the fact, that&#xD;
my story is what it purports to be, a simple tale of life-common joy and&#xD;
sorrow, whose' merits, if it has any, consist in its truthfulness to Nature,&#xD;
and the fervent spirit which animated its narration.&#xD;

were beginning to descend upon the thirsting petals, and in the&#xD;
breezeless air hung, in an almost visible cloud, the grateful&#xD;
return of spicy and languishable odors. A tall rose tree drooped&#xD;
over tI~p path, and as the bearers brushed by its stem, a shower,&#xD;
like pe~ med snow-flakes, lay 'upon the pall. The end of the&#xD;
journey wa~ reached; a secluded and beautiful spot in the lower&#xD;
part of the~arden, where were many mounds clustered together&#xD;
-graves of &amp;amp; hou old. A weeping willow, years before, a&#xD;
little shoot, plante the hand of the wife to mark her&#xD;
husband's resting.p now grown into a stately tree, swept its&#xD;
feathery pendants her pillow. The cords were lashed&#xD;
around the coffin, an e word given to lower it into the pit;~&#xD;
when-with a shriek t stilled the blood of the bystanders-.&#xD;
~ slight figure darte forward ' and clasped it in her arms.&#xD;
~Mother! oh mother ome back I" Men of iron nerVe bowed&#xD;
itt childlike weakness, d wept, as this desolate cry rent the air.&#xD;
~h~~poke not another word, but lay, her, cheek to the cold&#xD;
woo~:'~nc~osing the colder form, and her fingers interlocked in a&#xD;
vice4~e grasp. "' Ida! my child !" said the. o~Id minister,&#xD;
bendiiig to raise her; "She is not here. She is wi~th. her God.&#xD;
Can~you wish her. again upon this sinful earth ?" his consola-&#xD;
tion was addressed to an ear as dull as that of the co~pse. In&#xD;
that. outburst of frenzied supplic~tion, consciousness had' left her.&#xD;
"It is best so I" said the venerable man. "She could not have&#xD;
borne it else.'&#xD;
The ceremony was concluded -" dust to dust-ashes to&#xD;
ashes ;"-and the crowd turned sorrowfully away. It was. not&#xD;
in pity for~the orphan alone. There were none 'there whocould&#xD;
not 'recount som9 deed of love or charity done b~ 'her, whom&#xD;
they had given to the earth. Since the deaths of a ~fondly loved&#xD;
p~&amp;amp;rtner and three sweet children, Mrs. Ross had bought balm&#xD;
for her wounds, by binding up those of others. Ejivironed by&#xD;
neighbours; whose position and means were more humble than&#xD;
her own, she had ample exercise for her active benevolence ;.&#xD;
benevolence evincing itself,.-not in studied graciousness and&#xD;
lavish almsgiving, but in kindly sympathy, and those name-&#xD;
less offices' of friendship,, so easily rendered, so dear to the reci-&#xD;
pient. "her children shall rise up. and call her blessed," was&#xD;
the text of her funeral discourse, and 'the pastor but uttered the&#xD;
&#xD;
feelings of his auditory, when he called the community in which&#xD;
her blameless life had been passed, her family-loving her, and&#xD;
through her, united together in bonds of fraternal affection.. In&#xD;
this genial clime, had Ida Ross been nurtured ;-.--beloved for her&#xD;
mother's sake, as for the warm impulses of her generous nature;&#xD;
petted and indulged; yet obeying the least expression of her&#xD;
parent's wishes, not in slavish fear, but -a devotion amounting to&#xD;
worship. She had no companions of her own age who were her&#xD;
equals in education or refinement', and frow' intimate connection&#xD;
with ~rulgarity she shrank instinctively.+' Her pride was not&#xD;
offensively displayed. No one could live in the sphere of which&#xD;
Mrs. Ross was the ruling power and feet ought like supercilious..&#xD;
ness or contempt of inferiors. From i*if*tncy, Ida was her mo-&#xD;
ther's companion; at an early age her confidante and co-adviser;&#xD;
had read her pure heart as a richly illuminated missal, from&#xD;
which self-examination and severe criticism had expunged what-&#xD;
ever could sully or. disfigure. Can we marvel that she shrine&#xD;
her in her heart of hearts as a being more than human-scarcely&#xD;
less than divine?&#xD;
That mysterious Providence who guides the fowler's messen-&#xD;
ger of death to the breast of the parent bird, leaving the callow&#xD;
nestling to perish with hunger, recalled the mother's spirit ere&#xD;
'her labor of love was completed. Ida was an orphan in her fif-&#xD;
teentli year ;-the age of all others when a mother's counsels are&#xD;
needed ;-when the child stands tremblingly upon the thre&amp;amp;&#xD;
hold of girlhood, and looks with wondering, wistful eyes into the&#xD;
rosy vista opened to her si~ht. Babes in knowledge, nine girls&#xD;
out of ten are grown 4n h~ad at fifteen. A stroke, whether of&#xD;
extraordinary. joy or sorrdW;     times demolish the gew-&#xD;
gaws of the child, and reveal i             endurance, the&#xD;
steady faith, the all-absorbing   ,   oman. A week had&#xD;
passed-a week devoted by the ereaved to thoughts of, and&#xD;
weepiugs for the lost, by others to preparations for her residence&#xD;
among strangers. Years might elapse~ before her return. That&#xD;
night, as stealthily as though seeking a forbidden spot, she trod&#xD;
the path to her mother's grave. It was clear starlight, and abe&#xD;
sat down beside the newly sodded mound, and rested her brow&#xD;
upon it. Oold-cold and hard I but it entombed her mother ;-&#xD;

no loving breast to receive that aching head ;-.-no solace for the&#xD;
wounded spirit. The dew-gems lay freshly upon the grass ;-&#xD;
for her the dewiness of life was gone ;---earth was one vast sepul-&#xD;
chre, She looked up to the stars. In the summer evenings her&#xD;
mother's chair used to stand in the piazza, and she sat at her&#xD;
feet, her eyes fixed alternately upon her angelic face, and the&#xD;
shining orbs above them. D~[rs. Roes loved to think of them as&#xD;
the abodes &amp;amp;f the blest; the mansions prepared for those who&#xD;
had sojourned in this Bin-stained world and yet worn their white&#xD;
robes unblemished;~ .and~ ~the theory was confidently adopted by&#xD;

of those celestial regions until her straining eyes seemed to catch&#xD;
a glimpse of a seraph~a glittering robe, and she leaned breath-&#xD;
lessly forward to hear the music of his golden harp. But to-&#xD;
night the sparkling smiles of those effulgent ones, "forever sing-&#xD;
ing as they shine," wore changed to pitying regards as they&#xD;
beheld her so sad and lonely ;-the gleaip of the seraph's wings&#xD;
was dimmed; his far-off melody plaintive and, low, and the bur-&#xD;
den of his song was "alone."* The wind waved the willow-&#xD;
boughs, and a whispering ran through the leaves~-" Alone-..&#xD;
alone I" The words were so audibly breathed that the girl&#xD;
started in her delirious sorrow, and gazed wildly around. "Oh&#xD;
mother! cannot you leave Heaven fQr c~ne short minute to com-&#xD;

he saluted as "Mr. Hall" and "Miss Ross," introducing them&#xD;
to "Miss Read, my daughter." Ida glanced timidly into the&#xD;
face of her guardian, and then hastily scanned that of his daugh-&#xD;
ter. That the scrutiny was unsatisfactory, was to be read in the N&#xD;
deeper sadness that fell over her countenance, while the sinking&#xD;
lashes, and trembling lip showed.how sharp was the disappoint-&#xD;

that the bruised tendrils which had been torn from their original&#xD;
support coul~ never learn to twine around these gelid statues.&#xD;
"You w~l remain t't~ tea; Mr. Hall," sai&amp;amp;.Mr. Read, as the&#xD;
good clergyman arose.&#xD;
"I thank you, sir; but our journey ~hae been fatiguing owing&#xD;
to the extreme heat. I find myself in need of rest,-and my&#xD;
charge here requires it more than I do."&#xD;
"You will call before you leave the city. May we not hope&#xD;
for the pleasure of your company to dinner to-morrow ?"&#xD;
The invitation was accepted; and after a silent pressure of&#xD;
the hand from Ida, and a 'courtly bow from father and daughter,&#xD;
Mr. Hall took his leave.&#xD;
"Miss Ross would perhaps like to make some a Iteration in&#xD;
her dress, Josephine," Mr. Read said; jis manner testifying&#xD;
how necessary he esteemed the proposed measure. Miss Read&#xD;
rang for a light, and signified to Ida that she was ready to sho&#xD;
her up stairs. Any change from the bleak formality of th ~&#xD;
presence was a relief; and she longed to be alone, if hut for ha~1f&#xD;
an hour; 1~hat she might give way to t ' ~tions whiuli! ha&amp;amp;&#xD;
been rising 'and beating, through theJiv~ a~y, choking and&#xD;
blinding her. But Miss Read summoxia erv~nt, whom she&#xD;
ordered to wait upon Miss Ross, now zndiu future; and seated&#xD;
herself in a rocking-chair to watch the progress of the toilette,&#xD;
Mechanically I~a went through the tQrt~Wo of dressing. There&#xD;
are times when it is such ;-when the manifold details, hereto-&#xD;
fore so engaging, are to the preoccupied and suffering mind,&#xD;
like the thorn of the pricklyfear, too small to -be obs fed, but&#xD;
pricking burningly in every fibre and pore It was a woman.-.&#xD;
a sister--a girl as young as herself-perhaps as 'tender-hearted,-&#xD;
who sat there. Why not, wi~th the unrepressed sorrowfulness&#xD;
of a child, bury her face in her lap, and sob, "I have lost my&#xD;
mother I" to be fondled and comforted into composure? It&#xD;

&#xD;
would be sacrilege to ruffle the elegant propriety of her figure;&#xD;
and the gla~sy4eyes said, by their tearless stare,-" Between&#xD;
you and me there is a great gulf fixed I" One weakness Ida&#xD;
could not overcome; the re ugnance to beholding herself in her&#xD;
mourning garments. They as yet reminded her too vividly of&#xD;
the bier and the pall. She avertedd her eyes, as she stood before&#xD;
the mirror, to put the finis1~ing stroke to her apparel. "I beg&#xD;
your pardon," said the caln~ voice of Josephine. "Your collar&#xD;
is all awry. Permit me"- Ida submitted in silence, while&#xD;
her volunteer assistant unpinned, and re-arranged the crape&#xD;
folds, but as she gathered them under the, mourning brooch,&#xD;
a tear, large and pellucid, dropped upon her hand. It was but&#xD;
a drop of salt water to Miss Read, and she wiped it ofl as she&#xD;
asked her guest "to walk down to tea." To the Dew-corner, the&#xD;
palatable food was as the apples of Sodom-bitter ashes. She&#xD;
could not swallow or speak. Her companions ate and chatted&#xD;
with great gusto. The ill-humour of an hour since had passed&#xD;
away. This exe~iplary daughter was her father's idol, when&#xD;
contrasted with ot~ier, and less favored girls. She was formed&#xD;
in his image, and then the plastic mind was wax to receive, and&#xD;
adamant to retain 'impressions, he moulded it after a pattern of&#xD;
his own. He taught her deceit, under the name of self-control;&#xD;
heartlessness, he called prudence; veiled distrust and misan-&#xD;
thropy under clear-sightedness and knowledge of human nature.&#xD;
All those holy and beautiful feelings which evidence to man his&#xD;
kindred to his D* model and Creator, he tossed aside, with&#xD;
the sweeping con ation~-" romance and nonsense !" The&#xD;
crying sin was to be'~ ~6ma~nish ;"-" woman" and "fool" were&#xD;
synonyms, used indiscriminately to express the* superlative of&#xD;
ire-exciting folly. He delighted 'in showing* things as they&#xD;
were. Men :were machines, moved by secret springs of policy&#xD;
and knavery; the world a stage, viewed' by others in the decep-&#xD;
dive gla~p of artificial lights, and so made attractive. He had&#xD;
penetra into the&#xD;
in the uii4      mysteries behind the curtain, and examined&#xD;
of       ~ttez~ing day, the clumsy contrivances, gaudy daubing'&#xD;
and disgustful hollowness of the whole. Fancy and the pleasures ~&#xD;
imagination were empty, bombastic names; he would have&#xD;
seen in Niagara only a sizeable fall, and "calculated," amidst&#xD;
die rushing shout of its mighty waters, as to the number cf&#xD;
&#xD;
2$&#xD;
&#xD;
cotton-millS it would turn, and the thousands it would net him,&#xD;
could he transport it, patent right secured, to Virginia. He tore&#xD;
the cloud-covering from the storm-god's brow, and beheld a roar-&#xD;
ing, vaporing giant, whose insane attacks might be warded off&#xD;
by philosophical precautions, and discretion in the disposition of&#xD;
lightning rods.&#xD;
The party returned to the parlor. "You play, I presume,&#xD;
Miss Ross'?" said her guardian. Inexpressibly hurt by this&#xD;
new' proof of insensibility to her situation, Ida faltered an&#xD;
excuse of fatigue and want of practice; and with a very per-&#xD;
ceptible shrug, he addressed his daughter. "What apology&#xD;
have ~you, Josephine ?" She replied by going to the instrument,&#xD;
but had just taken her seat, when the door Gpened to admit&#xD;
three visitors-two school-fellows of Miss Read's, and their&#xD;
brother. "The Misses and Mr. Talbot" were presented~ in due&#xD;
form to the stranger, who had risen to leave the room.~ Jose-&#xD;
phine saw the movement, and arrested it by the introduction.&#xD;
No attention was pidd to her; and in the midst of th~ lively&#xD;
conversation,, she seized an opportunity to speak aside to J~ose-&#xD;
phine. "Ii wish to retire, if you please." Josephine started.&#xD;
If not so measured, the tone was as haughty as hers, at its&#xD;
~. proudest pitch. With a word of apology to her guests, she led&#xD;
the way into the hail, and lighted a lamp. Ida took it from&#xD;
her. "I will go up without you. Good night." She walked&#xD;
up the staircase with a steady step, for she was follow~?d by a&#xD;
gaze of wonderment and anger; but w her chamber w~&#xD;
gained, she 'sprang through the door-4oc and double 'locked&#xD;
it, and'dashed herself upon the floor. A hurricane raged within&#xD;
her-grief, outraged feeling and desperation. The grave had&#xD;
gorged her past, black walls of ice bounded the future~ Mean-&#xD;
while the sound of jocund voices came up through the flooring;&#xD;
bursts of laughter; and then music; brilliant waltzes and tri-&#xD;
umphant marches, to where the orphan lay sobbing, not we~pirig,&#xD;
with hysterical violence~ her hands clenched upon her temples,&#xD;
through which each convulsion sent a pang that ft~rced .froxii her'&#xD;
a moan of anguish.&#xD;
"She is a weal~, foolish' baby! it will take~ an immensity of&#xD;
schooling to make her gndurable ;" said Mr. Read, when the&#xD;
guests had gone.&#xD;

CHAPTI~R III.&#xD;
IN a~ crowded school-room, on a glorious October morning, a&#xD;
student~' was penning, with slow and heavy lingers, an Italian&#xD;
exercise. A physiognomist's eye would have wandered with&#xD;
compai~i~jve carelessness over the faces,-so various in feature&#xD;
and character-by which she was surrounded, and found in&#xD;
hers, subject for curious speculation; wondering at the contra~&#xD;
victory evidence her countenance and form gave of her age; the&#xD;
one, sombre in its thoughtfulness~its dark eyes piercing through&#xD;
his, into his soul, said twenty-.perhaps thirty-the lithe figure&#xD;
and rounded limbs, sixteen; but most, he would have marvelled&#xD;
at the listlessness of her attitude; the lack of interest in her&#xD;
occupation and external objects, when every l~ne, in brow, eyes&#xD;
and mouth, bespoke energy; a spirit strong to do or dare* and&#xD;
which, when in arm would achieve its purpose, or perish in the&#xD;
attempt. The hand oved more and~ more sluggishly, and the&#xD;
page was marred by blots and erasures., Thought had the&#xD;
crayon, and dark were the shades that fell upon the canvass.&#xD;
"Seventeen to-'day I Who remembers that it is my birth-day?&#xD;
There are none here to know or care. If I were to die to-mor-&#xD;
row, there is not a creature who woul~I shed a tear above my&#xD;
corpse. I wish I could die! They say such thoughts are&#xD;
sinful, but .'annihilation is preferable 'to an aimless, loveless&#xD;
existence. Oh I this intolerable aching, yearning, for affection&#xD;
-it is eating into my soul~ gnawing, insatiable longing! can&#xD;

.fulness-to cast myself down, the same heart-sick, famished&#xD;
creature! Our examination was an imposing affair. The elite&#xD;
of intelligence and fashion honored u with their presence. The&#xD;
prizes for which others had expended sleepless nights and toil-&#xD;
some days, were for me, who had scarcely put forth an effort;&#xD;
and as the music swelled out to celebrate my victory-blent&#xD;
with the applause of my critics, my heart beat! I had not felt&#xD;
it before for a long, long time,--and as. in a lightning flash, I&#xD;
saw what I might-what I would jeen, had the sunshine&#xD;
of love been continued to me. ~tchy cloud rolled over&#xD;
the dazzling opening, and I 'was Utranded wreck upon a&#xD;
barren shingle-the wailing monoto~W the deep in my ear. I&#xD;
read to them, that a tile was oxce cast upon an acanthus root,&#xD;
and 'the hardy plant thrust itg arms in every direction, until&#xD;
they felt the light, then coiled in spiral waves, to convert its&#xD;
oppressor into a thing of beauty;-and bade them, recognize in&#xD;
the 'Corinthian capital, an emblem, of' Truth, which had* in all~&#xD;
ages owed much of its transcendent loveliness to the tyranny&#xD;
that sought io stifle its growth ;-and when I pointed to it as a&#xD;
type of our national freedom, I was forced to stop,-for snowy&#xD;
handkerchiefs perfumed the air, and eager hands beat a .rap-&#xD;

heart was dying-puny and faded-beneath its weight. Intel-&#xD;
aect! a woman's intellect! I had rather be little Fanny Porter,&#xD;
with her silly, sweet face, and always imperfect lessons, than&#xD;
what I am. She has a father, mother, brothers, sisters, who&#xD;
dote upon her. Nourished upon fondness, she. asks love of all,,&#xD;
and never in vain. If I could dream my life away, I should be&#xD;
content. I love to lock my door upon the real world, and unbar&#xD;
the portals of my fairy palace-my thought..realm. ,~ Those long&#xD;
delicious reveries which melt so sweetly into my night-visions--&#xD;

I should be nearer my journey's end-~-or once more a happy&#xD;
child, nestling in my mother's bosom !"&#xD;
'~ Forgive me," said a gentle voice, "but your exercise is not&#xD;
finished, and it is near Signor Alboni~ hour."~ The speaker&#xD;
was the owner of the adjoining desk. As their eyes met, hers&#xD;
beamed with sympathy and interest. Ida knew nothing of the&#xD;
wretchedness expressed in her features, but she felt the agony&#xD;
at heart, and taken unawares, she could not entirely repress&#xD;
the tide that sprang to~~~jids at this unexpected kindness.&#xD;
Ashamed of what shern "schooled" to consider a weak-&#xD;
ness, she lowered hewer her writing, until the long&#xD;
curls hid her face. "Si~~ Alboni, young 'ladies I" called out&#xD;
Mr. Purcell, the principal o~ the seminary. Ida surveyed the&#xD;
unsightly sheet in dismay, ~ut there was no time for alteration,&#xD;
and she repaired with the rest to the recitation-room.&#xD;
Sigraor Alboni was a gaunt, ,bilious4ooki~ Italian, whom a&#xD;
residence of ten years in America had robbed of all national cha-&#xD;
racteristics, except a~ fiery temper. The girls feared and disliked&#xD;
him; but he was a popular and efficient teacher, t~nd in virtue&#xD;
of these considerations, Mr. Purcell was* inclined to overlook&#xD;
minor disadvantages. Ellen Morris, whose fun-making propeni~&#xD;
~ sites no rules or presence could restrain, soon set in circulatioif~&#xD;
a whispered report, that their "amiable professor had had ~.&#xD;
~evere return of dyspeptic symptoms since their last lesson&#xD;
* and' "don't you think he has a queer taste? They say his favor~.&#xD;
ite drink is a decoction of saffron, spiced with copperas I&#xD;
wonder he looks so like a piece of new nankeen." Then a~&#xD;
impromptu conundrum, pencilled upon a fly-leaf, went the round~&#xD;
of' the class. "If a skeleton were asked to describe his sensa-~&#xD;
tions in one word, whose name would he pronounce ?" Black,~&#xD;
brown and sunny tresses were shaken, and smiling mouths~&#xD;
motioned,.-" We give it up?' Ellen scribbled the auiswer,-.&#xD;
"All-bone-I."&#xD;
It is a singt4ar fact, that when one person is the unconscious&#xD;
cause ofj amusement ,to others~although ignorant of their ridi-&#xD;
cule, he often experiences an odd feeling of displeasure with&#xD;
himself and the whole world,-.a, sudden fit' of spleen, venting&#xD;
itself upon those who richly deserve the wrath, which in his sane&#xD;
mom~uts, he acknowledges was unprovoked. It was impossible9&#xD;
&#xD;
for the signor to observe the laughing faces, that sought refuge&#xD;
behind open books and friendly shoulders, for he was occupied in&#xD;
the examination of the pile of manuscripts laid upon his desk,&#xD;
yet his brow was more and more wrinkled each second, and&#xD;
when he spoke, his tone was, as Ellen afterwards described-&#xD;
"as musical as that of a papa lion, administering a parental&#xD;
rebuke to his refractory offspring."&#xD;
"Miss Porter I"&#xD;
Poor Fanny's eyes started from~ their sockets, as she uttered a&#xD;
feeble response.&#xD;
"Receive your exercise," tearing it in half, and-~iiiing her the&#xD;
fragments. "Remain after school-hours, and re-write it; also&#xD;
prepare the next' one in addition to-y~ur lesson for to-morrow.&#xD;
Miss Moi~iis, where do you purchase your ink ?"&#xD;
"Of Messrs. Politeness, Manners &amp;amp; Co.," she retorted, with&#xD;
an innocent smile. "You never deal there, I believe, sir ?"&#xD;
"Silence I" vo~dferated the infuriated foreigner. "Rest as-&#xD;
sured, Miss, J shall report your impertinence to Mr. Purcell.&#xD;
Miss Carleton !" and Ida's neighbour replied. "I find no im-&#xD;
portant errors in your theme, but your chirography lacks dignity&#xD;
and regularity."&#xD;
~.With a respectful courtesy, the paper and hint 'were received;&#xD;
and if a smile played around her mouth, as she contrasted her&#xD;
~delicate characters with the stiff, upright' hand, in which the&#xD;
corrections were made, he did not see it.&#xD;
"You had some incontestible reason for omitting to write,&#xD;
Miss Ross," with a sardonic grin;- "into its nature I shall not&#xD;
inquire, but plead guilty to curiosity~to know the ~iame of the&#xD;
friend who did 'your work, and appended your name to his or&#xD;
her elegant effort."&#xD;
Ida was not of a disposition to brook insolence, and she an*&#xD;
swerved with spirit,-" The exercise~ mine, sir."&#xD;
"By right of possession, I suppose~"&#xD;
"It was written by myself." N&#xD;
"Do I believe you, when my eyes tell me this is neither your&#xD;
hand-writing or style? Who was your accomplice in this witty-&#xD;
deception ?"&#xD;
"SIR 1"&#xD;

"Who wrote this theme ?" he thundered, maddened by her&#xD;
contempt.&#xD;
"I' have told you-I did. No one else has seen it."&#xD;
"You lie!"&#xD;
With one lig1~tnix~g glance, she arose; but he placed himself&#xD;
between her and the door.&#xD;
"Let me pass 1" she ordered.&#xD;
"Signor Alboni I" said Miss Carle~on, who had before endea-&#xD;
vored to make herself heard, "I c~n certify to the truth of&#xD;
Miss Ross' statement. I. saw her coin mence and complete her&#xD;
manuscript."&#xD;
"Aha! yet she says it has been seen only by herself. You&#xD;
n~ust tutor your witnesses more carefully. They convict, instead&#xD;
of exculpate."&#xD;
"If you hint at collusion between Miss Ross and myself, I&#xD;
can say that we never exchanged a worc~ until an hour since.&#xD;
My desk adjoins hers; it was this circumstance which furnished&#xD;
me with the knowledge of her morning~ s occupationn"&#xD;
"I~ beg you will not subject yourself to further insult, upon&#xD;
my account," interrupted Ida, whose figure had dilated and&#xD;
heightened during the colloquy;-.--then to him.-" Once more I&#xD;
corn and you to stand aside! If you do not obey, I shall call&#xD;
Mr. i~ircelL" . As if he had heard the threatened appeal, the&#xD;
prince al appeared in the doorway, in blank astonishment at the&#xD;
*       novel aspect of affairs. Alboni commenced a hurried jargon,&#xD;
inarticulate through haste and rage; Ida stood with folded arms,&#xD;
countenance settled in sucl~ proud scorn as Lucifer would have&#xD;
envied and striven to imitate. The prudent preceptor perceived&#xD;
at a glance the danger of present investigation; and abruptly&#xD;
declaring the lesson concluded, appointed an hour on the morrow&#xD;
for a hearing of the, case. That evening, for. the first time in&#xD;
many m~pths, Ida voluntarily sought . her guardian's presence.&#xD;
Josephin~~~ was in her room, and he was left to the enjoyment; of&#xD;
solitude ~Aid the, newspaper. He arose at the approach of his&#xD;
visitant, and offered her a chair. . In *these little matters of&#xD;
etiquette, he was particular to punctiliousness&#xD;
businessjiabits of law and order into every ~ carrying his&#xD;
thing. The paper&#xD;
was replaced upon the stand; the spectacles wiped and returned&#xD;
&#xD;
tc~ their case; and those matter-of-fact eyee raised with an inter-&#xD;
rogative look.&#xD;
"You have been informed of the altercation that occurred in&#xD;
the Italian class to-day ?" Ida said, waiving the preliminary&#xD;
remarks.&#xD;
"Josephine mentioned it."&#xD;
"May I ask what was her version of it 7"&#xD;
"It was a statement cif facts."&#xD;
"Doubtless. Then, sir, you are aware that I have been wan-&#xD;
tonly and grossly insulted by a man for wEom I have no respect;&#xD;
that in the presence of the entire class, I was forced to listen to&#xD;
language, which, uttered by one man to another, would be met&#xD;
by prompt chastisement; you are furthermore advised of the&#xD;
fact that he, whose duty it is to protect those whom he instructs,&#xD;
instead of compelling the creature to apologize upon his knee;&#xD;
'postponed inquiry until to-morrow.~~~&#xD;
"And very properly, too."&#xD;
"Unquestionably, sir !" with the sarcastic smile which accom-&#xD;
panied her former assent. "My object in seeking this interview,&#xD;
is to request your attendance upon that occasion. I shall not&#xD;
be present."&#xD;
And why not ?"&#xD;
"Because, sir, I will not be confronted with that odious rep~&#xD;
tile, and give my testimony in his hearing. Judging from the&#xD;
past, and the knowledge of mankind I have acquired under your&#xD;
tuition, nothing that I can say will avail to secure me justice~&#xD;
Mr. Purcell cannc4 obtain a better teacher, and it. is as politic in&#xD;
Alboni to remain. There will be an amicable settlement; and&#xD;
my word will be a knot in the chain of satisfactory evidence&#xD;
they will elicit. The young ladies will, of course, side with 'the&#xD;
gentlemen.'"&#xD;
"But why am. I to be there 7-to receive Alboni's apology?"&#xD;
"I want none, sir-I will hear none. I have been called a&#xD;
liar! his pitiful life could not expiate the offence I"&#xD;
"You are savage, young lady 1- you wish, perhaps, that I&#xD;

her counsels and example. I loathe myself! 'A woman, you&#xD;
said, rather a fiend! for such is woman when she buries her&#xD;
heart, nor mourns above its grave. 'Control my feelings!' I&#xD;
do! I have driven back the tears until the scalding waves have&#xD;
killed whatever in my soul could boast a heavenly birth. There&#xD;
is nothing there to prove my relationship to my mother, hut her&#xD;
memory. When that is destroyed I shall go madq I am on&#xD;
the verge of insanity now- oft n am! I do not doubt your&#xD;
assertions as to your, and shame on me that I should say it, my&#xD;
brethren; for in yourself I see all the traits you ascribe to them.&#xD;
Woman, you say, belongs to an order of yet inferior beings; and&#xD;
in your daughter I have an illustration of this; for she inherits&#xD;
her father's character, combined with a meaner mind. You con..&#xD;
sider that I owe you respect,-IL do n6t! 'IL am superior to you&#xD;
both, for I still struggle with the einolons our Creator kindled&#xD;
up with~ u's, and sent~ us'to earth to extinguish. Within your&#xD;
bosom ~2.there are only cold ashes. Frown as you please! your&#xD;
anger intimidates as little as your ridicule abashes. The idea&#xD;
once entered my mind that I could win you and your child to&#xD;
love me. IL could laugh at the thought; that was in my senti-&#xD;
mental days, when I deemed that the desolate orphan must find&#xD;
affection somewhere. My most 'extravagant' imaginings never&#xD;
paint such a possibility now. I have done. We understand&#xD;

burning torrent, as the door closed upon her. "She's a dan-&#xD;

picked up his "Enquirer," but the political news was stale&#xD;

through her eyes, more plainly than her lips, said, "I despise&#xD;

CHAPTER Iv.&#xD;
Miss CARLE'TON acknowledged the appearance of b~r desk-&#xD;
mate on the succeeding morning, by an~ inclination of the head&#xD;
and a smile; and nothing more passed between them until the&#xD;
hour for Italian. She paused, seeing that Ida retained her seat.&#xD;
"Are you not going in ?" she ventured to ask.&#xD;
"No."   '          *&#xD;
There was a moment &amp;amp;~ hesitation, and she spoke again. "I&#xD;
would not appear to dictate, but do you not fear A1'lr. Purcell&#xD;
may construe your non-attendance into disrespect to' himself ?"&#xD;
"I fear nothing," was upon Ida's 1~ong.ue, but her better&#xD;
nature would not allow her to return rudeness for what, suspi.&#xD;
cion could torture into nothing but disinterest9d kindness.&#xD;
With a gleam of her former frankness she looked up at her&#xD;
interlocutor, "You do not 'know as much as I do; or you would&#xD;
understand the inutility of my presence at the trial to come off&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.           '            23&#xD;
this morning. I would avoid a repetition of yesterday's scene&#xD;
One will suffice for a life-time."&#xD;
"You met then with insult and injustice. To-day, Mr. Pur-&#xD;
cell'will shield you from both. As a gentleman, and a conscien-&#xD;
tious judge, he cannot but see that Alboni's at~#~k was uncalled&#xD;
for, and decide against him."&#xD;
"No man is conscientious when his conscience militates against&#xD;
his purse and popularity?'&#xD;
Miss Carleton seemed shocked, and Ida added, hastily, "Our&#xD;
viewS upon this, as upon most subjects, are very different, I&#xD;
fancy; therefore, discussion 'is worse than useless. In this&#xD;
instance, my dbterminatiOn is taken ;" and she opened her book.&#xD;
"I will not attempt to shake it," replied her companion.&#xD;
"But suffer me to hope for a longer conversation at some future&#xD;
time, upon these topics, concerning which you think we differ.&#xD;
There may be some points of agreement, and I, for one, am open&#xD;
to conviction."&#xD;
Again was Ida thrown off her guard, and I the smile that&#xD;
answered, irradiated her face like a sudden sunbeam. But&#xD;
when her class-mate had gone, she thought,-" Weak fool ~ the&#xD;
reserve I have striven for two years to establish, melted by a&#xD;
soft speech of a schoolgirl. She is one of the would-be 'popu-&#xD;
lar' sort, and'would worm herself into confidence by an affectation&#xD;
of sympathy and sWeetness."&#xD;
"Miss' Ross," said Mr. Purcell, a while later, coming up to&#xD;
her desk, "you will do me the favor to meet' me in my study at&#xD;
two o'clock."&#xD;
At - the time designated, she walked with ~ stately tread&#xD;
through the long school-room, unabashed 'by the hundred curious&#xD;
eyes bent upon her; for a summons to "the study" was an, event&#xD;
of rare occurrence, and~ had been heretofore the harbinger of&#xD;
some important era in the annals of school-dom. Ida was' pre~&#xD;
pared for every thing partialitf could dictate, and tyranny&#xD;
execute; but Mr. Purcell was alone, and his demeanor anything&#xD;
but' menacing. "He thinks to cajole me," whispered the fell&#xD;
demon Distrust, and her heart changed to steel.&#xD;
"'Miss Ida," began the principal, mildly, "this is your' third&#xD;
session in this institution, and I can sincerely declare that d~iring&#xD;
that time, your propriety of behaviour, and diligence in study&#xD;

&#xD;
have not been surpassed. U have never had a young lady under&#xD;
my care, whose improvement was more rapid.-.of whose attain-&#xD;
inents I was more proud; but 'I regret to say, never one whose&#xD;
confidence I failed so..signally to gain. A teacher's task, my&#xD;
dear Miss Ross, is at best an arduous one, but if he. receive no&#xD;
recompense for his toil in the affection of those for whom he&#xD;
labors, his life is indeed one of cheerless drudgery. You appear&#xD;
to regard me as a mere machine. For time I attributed your&#xD;
reserve to diffidence, and trusted that time and my efforts would&#xD;
'~dissipate it. On the contrary, the distance between us has&#xD;
increased. You' hold yourself aloof from your school-mates,&#xD;
repelling- every offered famiiarit~, yet~ I have seen you weep&#xD;
after such an act. Your cheek ~lows with enthusiasm when&#xD;
your favorite studies engage your~ mind, and you relapse into&#xD;
frigid 'hauteur when recalled to the actual world around you.&#xD;
You have feeling as well as intelle~t-you are acting a part&#xD;
assumed from some unaccountable ~fancy; or, I would rather&#xD;
believe, put upon you by necessity. The evidence of your want&#xD;
of reliance in my friendship ~hieh you have given me to-day,&#xD;
has determined me to speak candidly with you. I would not&#xD;
wrest a confession from you which you might afterwards repent,&#xD;
but I entreat you. to look upon me as a friend who has a paternal&#xD;
love for each member of his numerous family, who desires to see&#xD;
* you happy, and asks-not your confidence, but that you will let&#xD;
him serve you.~,&#xD;
Ida sat like a statue. He resumed in a tone of disappointment.-.-.&#xD;
"As to the unjustifiable charge brought by Signor Alboni-.I.&#xD;
am aware how galling is even the appearance of humiliation upon&#xD;
so proud a spirit. I have investigated the matter carefully., The&#xD;
testimony of'your friend, Miss Carleton, would of itself have been&#xD;
sufficient to exonerate you. It was coxifirmed by the voice of the&#xD;
class, and the inevitable consequence is, that Signor Alboni no.&#xD;
longer has a place in my school. I can safely promise that the&#xD;
teacher I have selected in his stead, will oppose no impediment&#xD;
to your progress."&#xD;
Shame for her unjust accusations, and remorseful ingratitude&#xD;
pierced Ida's bosom. Greatly agitated, she approached her&#xD;
instructor, when Mr. Read walked. in ;-a cynical* iceberg!&#xD;
Every generous emotion-..-.all softness vanished on the instant.&#xD;
&#xD;
2A&#xD;
&#xD;
'9&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
Ills inquiring glance encountered one as freezing. 'C I will not&#xD;
~    detain you longer, Mr. Purcell," she said, as if concluding a&#xD;
business arrangement. "As nearly as I can understand, your&#xD;
object  sending for  was to secure me as a pupil of the new&#xD;
Ianguage..inaster. Having undertaken the study of the Italian,&#xD;
[prefer going through with the course. Mr. Read will settle&#xD;
the terms. Good afternoon, gentlemen ;" and with the mien of&#xD;
~ duchess she left them.&#xD;
Mr. Read "had been delayed by pressing business. Miss&#xD;
Ross requested him to see Signor Alboni-was sorry he ~was&#xD;
late-presumed all was right, etc.," and walked out again. Mr.&#xD;
Purcell was too much hurt, and too indignant at his pupil's con-&#xD;
duct, to care whether he stayed or not.&#xD;
The misguided girl had alienated a true friend, and she knew&#xD;
it-felt it in her heart's core. In the solitude of her chamber&#xD;
she wept bitter tears: "I have cast away the gem for which I&#xD;
would sell my soul! While I thirsted for the 'waters of affec-&#xD;
tion, I struck down the hand that held them to my lip. It is&#xD;
my fate-I was not born to be loved-I hate myself-why&#xD;
should I inspire others with a different feeling ?"&#xD;
In vain she tried to reason herself into a belief of Mr. Pur-&#xD;
cell's insincerity. Truth speaks with a convincing tongue, and&#xD;
she knew that the imputation of interested motives she had&#xD;
hurled at him in the unfortunate revulsion of feeling, was&#xD;
unfounded.&#xD;
In intermission next day, a note was laid upon Ida's desk,&#xD;
inscribed in towering capitals, to "Misses Ross and Carleton."&#xD;
It ran thus&#xD;
"At a large and enthusiastic meeting of the Italian class of&#xD;
Mr. Purcell's 'Young Ladies' Female Seminary, convened on&#xD;
yesterday afternoon, the succeeding resolutions were proposed,&#xD;
and carried unanimously.&#xD;
"Resolved, That whereas, Miss Ida Ross and Miss Caro~line&#xD;
Carleton, members of the aforesaid class, have, by their spirited&#xD;
independence delivered us from ~an oppression as grinning as that&#xD;
under which our Revolutionary forefathers groaned, a vote of&#xD;
thanks' shall be tendered them in the name of their compatriots.&#xD;

"Res6lved, Moreover, that we bind ourselves to assist them&#xD;
by our united suifrages. in the attainment of any honor for which&#xD;
they shall hereafter be candidates, whether the dunce-block or&#xD;
the gold medal.              ANNA TALEOT, Chairman.&#xD;
ELL~N MORRIS, Secretary.&#xD;
The event whieh had elicited this public manifestation, was&#xD;
to Ida, connected with too much that was unpleasant, to allow&#xD;
her to smile at the pompous communication. She passed it&#xD;
gravely to h~r neighbor., She laughed at the ludicrous r~petb&#xD;
tion of feininity in the second line, and at the conclusion,&#xD;
bounded upQ~n the platform where stood Mr. Purcell's desk,.&#xD;
and commenced a flourishing harangue "for herself and col-&#xD;
league," expressing their gratitude at the flattering tribute from&#xD;
their fellow-laborers, and pledging themselves to uphold forever&#xD;
their honor and lawful privileges. "In the language of your&#xD;
eloquent resolution, my sisters, we form a 'Young Ladies'&#xD;
Female Seminary'-~ womanfully will we battle for woman's&#xD;
rights."&#xD;
"Hush-h-h !" and Mr. Purcell ~vas discovered standing be~iind&#xD;
the crowd. He stood aside to let the blushing orator return to&#xD;
her scat, remarking in an under-tone as she passed, "I must&#xD;
take care to enlist such talents in my sorvice-I shall be undone&#xD;
if they are directed against me."&#xD;
"Oh Carry! what did he say ?" whispered Fanny Porte.&#xD;
"Nothing very dreadful," she returned, laughingly. Ida&#xD;
looked on in surprise, Josephine with scorn; but to the majority,&#xD;
this little episode in their monotonous life, was a diverting enter-&#xD;
tainment.&#xD;
"Give me a girl who is not too p~oud to relish a joke," said&#xD;
Ellen Morris. "Ida Rose is above su~h buffoonery She would&#xD;
not have demeaned her dignity before the school."&#xD;
"But Carry spoke for her too," said Emma Glenn, a meek,&#xD;
charitable creature. "Perhaps modesty, not pride, kept her&#xD;
8ile~t,"&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks 1" was the school-girlish rejoinder.&#xD;
Ida had missed a chance for making herself popular. The&#xD;
girls were moved to admiration by her 'manner of Tesenting&#xD;
Alboni's rudeness, and their joy at getting rid of him, assumed&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                         27&#xD;
~he shape of gratitude to their champion. She was for the hour&#xD;
a heroine, and might have retained her stand, but for her cool&#xD;
treatment of their advances. She saw, without understanding&#xD;
the reason of the change, that there was now a mingling of dis-&#xD;
like in their neglect; and as ~he sank in their esteem, Carry&#xD;
mounted. Mr. Purcell never noticed her out of the recitation&#xD;
room-Mr. Read was more lofty-Josephine more contemptuous&#xD;
than ever Inmates of one house~occupying adjacent chain&#xD;
bers-sittifig at the same board at home, and within speaking&#xD;
distance at scho~b.l, the two girls had not one feeling iti common&#xD;
-a spark of affection one for the other. Open ruptures were&#xD;
infrequent now, although they were innumerable durir~g the first&#xD;
months of their companionship. They appeared together in pub-&#xD;
lic-this Mr. Read enjoined ". It was due to his reputation,&#xD;
people should not say that his daughter's privileges exceeded&#xD;
his ward's." 13'urther than this he did not interfere. He saw&#xD;
them only at meal-times, and in the evening; then JosephWe&#xD;
presided over the tea-tray with skill and grace, and amii~ed&#xD;
him, if he wished it, by reading, singing or talking. Ida did as&#xD;
she pleased. There were no requirements, no privations. In&#xD;
the eyes of the world her situation was unexceptionable. They&#xD;
knew nothing of the covert sneers which smiled down ~ny ten-&#xD;
dency to what the torpid minds of the fatM~ ~nd daughter&#xD;
considered undue enthusiasm; their sarcastic notice of her "sin-&#xD;
gularities," t)aeir studied variance with her views ;-but to her,&#xD;
bondage and ertielty would have been more tolerable. Yet this&#xD;
mocking surveillance-this certainty of ridicule, could not always&#xD;
check the earnest expression of a grasping intellect and ardent&#xD;
temperament; and there were not a few who frequented the&#xD;
house, who preferred the piquancy of her conversation, when&#xD;
they could draw her out of the snow-caverns of her reserve, to&#xD;
the trite common-places and artificial spirits of Miss Read.&#xD;
Among these was Mr. Dermott, an Irish gentleman of con&#xD;
siderable scientific renown, and a traveller of some note; hard&#xD;
~pon forty years of age, but enjoying life with the zest of&#xD;
t\veuty. Ida's inte]liger~ cour~tenance had pleased him at their&#xD;
iAtroduction, and having letters to Mr. Read, he embraced eyery&#xD;
opportunity to improve the acquaintance.&#xD;
"I shall not go to school ~to-day," said Josephine, one morn~&#xD;

ing, "father expects Mr. Dermott and several other gentlemen&#xD;
to dine with him, and I cannot be spared. He says you must&#xD;
come home in time for dinner."&#xD;
"A8 school break~ up at three, and you will not dine before&#xD;
five, there was no need to issue the command"' said Ida, irritated&#xD;
at her arrogant tone.&#xD;
"Very well, I hav~ delivered the message."&#xD;
Mr. Read was dissatisfied that his ward did not enter the&#xD;
~1rawing-room until dinner was announced. "It did not look&#xD;
well,"--andt her nonchalant air and slight recognition of the&#xD;
party, did not "speak well for his l~ringing up." But the&#xD;
current veered before meal was over. The fowls were under-&#xD;
done, and the potatoes soaked. His gl~tnce of displeasure at his&#xD;
daughter was received .wit.h such imperturbability, that he chafed&#xD;
at the impossibility of moving her, and his desire to render some~&#xD;
body uncomfortable. The latter wish was not left ungratified.&#xD;
One after another felt the influence of his lowering brow, and&#xD;
imitated his silence, until Mr. IDermott and Ida were the only&#xD;
ones who maintained a connected conversation. He talked&#xD;
fluently with the humor peculiar to his countrymen, and had&#xD;
succeeded in interesting his listener. She had naturally a&#xD;
happy laugh, which in earlier years rung out in merry music;&#xD;
and as the unusual sound startled him from time t&amp;amp;time, Mr.&#xD;
Read took it as a personal affront. Could not she see that he&#xD;
was out of temper? lie had punished the rest for the cook's&#xD;
misdeeds, how~dare she, while they sat 'neath the thunder cloud&#xD;
of his* magnificent wrath, sport in the sunshine? It was auda-&#xD;
cious bravado. She should rue it ere long. Josephine readily&#xD;
obeyed his signal to leave the table, so soon as it could be done&#xD;
with a semblance of p~3j~iety. "I will hear the rest, by and&#xD;
by," said Ida to Mr. Dermott, "au revoir." Neither of the&#xD;
girls spoke after quitting the dining-room. Josephine lay upon&#xD;
a lounge, with half..closed lids, apparently drowsy or fatigued,&#xD;
in reality, wakeful and watching. Ida walked back and forth,&#xD;
humming an Irish air-.pleased and thoughtful. Tben taking&#xD;
from the bookcase a volume of " Travels," she employed herself&#xD;
in looking it over.&#xD;
"See!" said she, at Mr. Dermott's reappearance, "it is as I&#xD;
thought. This author's account varies, in some respects, from&#xD;

from yours; and at the peril of my 'place in your good graces, I&#xD;
must declare my prejudices to be with him. A spot so cele..&#xD;
rated, so sacred in its associations, cannot be as uninteresting&#xD;
as you would have me to think. Come, cc~nfess, that the jolting&#xD;
camel and surly guide were accessories to your* discontent."&#xD;
Josephine lost the answer, and miZch that followed. She was&#xD;
joined by young Pemberton, a fop of the first water, with sense&#xD;
enough to make him uneasy in the society of the gifted, and&#xD;
meanness to rejoice in their discomfiture and misfortune. For&#xD;
the rest, he was weak and hot-headed, a compound of conceit&#xD;
and malice. Time was when he admired Ida. He had an&#xD;
indefinite notion that a. clever wife would reflect . lustre upon&#xD;
him; and a very decided appreciation of her more shining and&#xD;
substantial charms.&#xD;
Her repulse was a mortal offence: small minds never forget,&#xD;
much less pardon a rebuke to their vanity, and he inly swore&#xD;
revenge. But how to get it? She rose superior to his witless&#xD;
sa~casms, and more pointed slights;' reversing the arrows towards&#xD;
himself, and his mortification heated into hatred. Josephine was&#xD;
aware of this feeling, and. its cause; and while despising, in &amp;amp;&#xD;
man, a weakness to which she was herself a prey, foreseeing that&#xD;
he might prove a convenient tool, she attached him to her by&#xD;
suasives and flatteries.&#xD;
"It is a positive relief to talk to you, Miss Josephine," he&#xD;
yawned, "I am surfeited with literature and foreigners. These&#xD;
travelled fellows are outrageous bores~ with their bushy mousta-&#xD;
duos and outlandish lingo. How the. ladies can fawn upon&#xD;
them as they do, I cannot comprehend."&#xD;
"IDo not condemn us all for the failings of a part. There are&#xD;
those who prefer pure gold to gilded trash."&#xD;
"For your sake, I will make some exceptions," with a "kill-&#xD;
ing" look. "But what do you imagine to be the object of that&#xD;
flirtation? No young lady of prudence or proper self-respect,&#xD;
would encourage so boldly the attentions of &amp;amp; stranger. Sup-&#xD;
posing him to be what he represents, (a thing by no means&#xD;
certain,) she cannot intend to marry him-a man old enough to&#xD;
be her father!'&#xD;

towards reconcilin&amp;amp;~er' to the disparity of years," observed&#xD;

Josephine, ironically; not sorry to strike upon this tender point.&#xD;
He tried to laugh, but with mdi erent success.&#xD;
Ida's voice reached them, and they stopped to listen.&#xD;
~ I am afraid my conceptions f Eastern life and scenery are&#xD;
more poeticaF than correct. I picture landscapes sleeping in&#xD;
warm, rich, 'Sy~ ian sunshine,' sandal groves and bowers of&#xD;
spice,'&#xD;
'Ruined shrines, an towers that seem&#xD;
The relics of some splendid dream,'-&#xD;
such a Fairy Land as ignorance and imagination create."&#xD;
"The Utopia ~f one who studies iLalla Rookh more than&#xD;
'Eastern Statisti~s,' or 'Incidents of ~ravel,"' said Mr. Der-&#xD;
inQtt, smiling. '~ Yet Moore's descriptions are not so much&#xD;
overwrought as some. suppose. His words came continually to&#xD;
my tongue. He has imbibed the true spirit of Oriental poetry;&#xD;
the melancholy, which, like the ghost of a dead age, broods over*&#xD;
that oldest of lands; the passion flushing under their tropical&#xD;
sun; their wealth of imagery. Lalla Rookh reads like a trans-&#xD;
lation from the original Persian. The wonder is that he has&#xD;
never been self-tempted to visit the 'Vale of Cashmere' in&#xD;
person.&#xD;
"Campbell, too, having immortalized Wyoming, will not cross&#xD;
the ocean to behold ~t," said Ida.&#xD;
There was a consultation between the confederates, and Pem-&#xD;
berton crossed to Id~'s chair, with a smirk that belied the fire&#xD;
in his eye.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Mr. Dermott,-Miss Ida, I am commissioned to&#xD;
inquire of you the authorship and meaning of this quotation-.&#xD;
'Deeply, darkly, desperately blue 1"'&#xD;
It is impossible to convey a just I     of the offensive&#xD;
tone and emphasis with, which t impertinence was' uttered.&#xD;
The quiek-witted Irishman s through the design in an&#xD;
instant. "It is from a Sc ch author," said he, before Ida&#xD;
ooul4 reply, "and the rhyme runs after this fashion-'&#xD;
'Feckless, fairlie, farcically foul"'&#xD;
and not deigning a second glance at the questioner, he con-&#xD;
tinued his account of a visit he had paid to Moore. The object.&#xD;

of this merciless retort stood for a second, in doubt as to its&#xD;
meaning, and then walked~ off, still in incertitude. Ida's laugh,&#xD;
while it might have been in response to Mr. Dermott's story,&#xD;
assured Josephine that her end was unaccomplished, before her&#xD;
messenger had delivered his lame return.&#xD;
"She understood me, and it cut pretty deeply, but that puppy&#xD;
$ of a paddy answered for her. He repeated the next line, too,&#xD;
'from a Scotch author,' he said, but I believe he made it up."&#xD;
"What was it ?" asked Josephine.&#xD;
"'Fairly, farcically fon,' or something like that. If I were&#xD;
sure that last word meant fool, I would knock him down. Do&#xD;
you understand Scotch ?"&#xD;
"No," i~'eplied Josephine, vexed, but 'afraid to excite him&#xD;
further. "He is beneath the notice of a gentleman; we can&#xD;
let him alone."&#xD;
But Ida's share in this was not to be overlooked. Josephkie&#xD;
appeared as usual at breakfast: talkative to her father, and taci-&#xD;
turn to her female companion. At length she inquired, mean-&#xD;
ingly, "by the way, Ida, when does your travelled Hibernian&#xD;
"lave this countryy?"&#xD;
"If you speak of Mr. Dermott, I do not know."&#xD;
"Is it not remarkable," said Josephine to her parent, "that&#xD;
polish and purify as you may, you cannot cure an Irishman of&#xD;
vulgarity? Irish he is, and Irish he will remain to the end of&#xD;
the chapter."&#xD;
"Dermott behaves very decently, does he not? His letters&#xD;
of. recommendation-introduction, I would say, describe him as&#xD;
a pattern gentleman."&#xD;
Josephine lifted her brows. "It. is a misfortune to be fas~&#xD;
tedious; my education has rendered m~ so. I cannot tolerate&#xD;
slang or abuse; especially when directed at a superior iil polite-&#xD;
ness, if not in assurance."&#xD;
"What now?" demanded Mr. Read, impatiently; 'and Ida,&#xD;
unable to hear more in silence, started up from the table.&#xD;
"Wait, if you please," said Josephine, with that met~dlic&#xD;
glitter of her grey eyes. "I wish you to repeat your friend's.&#xD;

"I do not choose to tell. I am not in the habit of playing&#xD;
spy and informer.&#xD;
*" Then I shall repeat it. lam not in the abit of winking at&#xD;
impudence or transgressions of the mosl corn on laws of society.&#xD;
What do you say, sir, of a man who, in the presence of ladies,&#xD;
calls another a 'farcical fool?'"&#xD;
"That he is a foreign jackanape. He never darkens my&#xD;
door again. You heard this ?" to Ida.&#xD;
"I did not, sir, but Mr. Pembe~rton displays such penetration&#xD;
in discovering, and taste in fitting on caps that could suit ~io one&#xD;
else so well, I am not inclined, to contest his title to this 'latest&#xD;
style.".&#xD;
"I do not wonder at your defence of your erudite suitor,"&#xD;
said Josephine, laying a disagreeable ~stress upon the adjective.&#xD;
"If he were to single me out in every company, as the one being&#xD;
capable of appreciating him, I, too, should be blinded by the&#xD;
distinction attendant upon my notoriety. But as His Highness&#xD;
never gives token,' by word or deed, of his consciousness of the&#xD;
existence of so unpretending a personage, I may be pardoned&#xD;
my impartial observation and judgment. I do not expect you&#xD;
to forbid his visits, sir, iut I wish it understood that I am not&#xD;
at home when he calls."&#xD;
"And that you reject his attentions ?" asked Ida, dryly.&#xD;
Josep~iine did not like her smile, yet saw no danger in reply-&#xD;
"It is a pity," was the rejoinder, "that your resolutioil was&#xD;
not postponed until Tuesday."&#xD;
"And why ?" said Mr. Read.&#xD;
"Mr. Dermot informed me last night that he had secured three&#xD;
tickets for the concert of Monday evening, and requested permit~&#xD;
mon to call for Josephine and myself. I told him that she had&#xD;
&#xD;
~V expressed anxiety to attend, and that I was disengaged. She&#xD;
was not in the parlor when he left, and he entrusted the invita-&#xD;
tion to me. He will be here this forenoon for her answers. As&#xD;
things now stand, his visit will -b~ extremely mal-apropos. I&#xD;
shall decline for myself; she can do the same."&#xD;
Josephine prudently lowered her eye-lids, but her ilps were&#xD;
white with rage. She had especial reasons for desiring to go to&#xD;
K this concert. Ehrery body wa~ running mad after the principal&#xD;
, performer :-~.absence from necessity would be a pitiable inflic-&#xD;
~ tion ;-to stay away from choice, irrefragable proof of want of&#xD;
taste. To be escorted thjther by Mr. Dermott, would give her&#xD;
an 6lat, the devotion of a score of Pembertons could not pro-&#xD;
duce. In seeking to mortify another, she had pulled down this&#xD;
heavy chagrin upon her own head,-~common fate tf those who.&#xD;
would make the hearts and backs of their fellows the rounds of&#xD;
their ladder to revenge or to fame.&#xD;
Even Mr. Read was momentarily disconcerted. "I will pro~.&#xD;
cure you a ticket," he said, consolingly.&#xD;
That tongue was used to falsehood, yet it did not move a~&#xD;
~ glibly as was its wont, as she replied, "I do not care.to go, sir,"&#xD;
"That is fortunate,". said Ida, "as every seat was taken yes~&#xD;

matter must be arranged."&#xD;
She opened her writing-desk. Her chamber was her retreat&#xD;
and sanctum,' and she had lavished much taste and time in fit.&#xD;
ti~,it up. All its appurtenances poke of genius and refine-&#xD;
m~it. With a poetic love for war colors and striking contrasts,&#xD;
crimson and black relieved, each the other, in her carpet and&#xD;
curtains. The bedstead, seats and tables, fashioned into elegant&#xD;
an~ uncommon forms by her orders, were draped and cushioned&#xD;
with th~ same Tyrian hue. Books and portfolios were he aped&#xD;
and strewed upon the shelves and stands; and in one corner,&#xD;
upon a wrought bronze tripod, was an exquisite statuette-a girl&#xD;
kneeling beside an empty cage, the lifeless songster stark and&#xD;
cold in her hand Several of Ida's schoolmates were with her&#xD;
when she purchased it from an itinerant Italian. The ~aw in&#xD;
the expression of hopeless madness , only regret for her bi~d. Ida&#xD;
noted that her gaze was not upon its ruffled plumes, b~it to its&#xD;
silent home ~ and that one hand la~ upon her heart. cooking&#xD;
more narrowly she discerned upon the pedestal the simple excla-&#xD;
mation, "Et*non eceur I"&#xD;
Ilenceforward it had become her I~ares. She had scattered&#xD;
flowers over it, kissed it weepingly, and with lips rigid in stern&#xD;
despair, laid her hot brbw to the white forehead of the voiceless&#xD;
mourner. She must have something to love, and the insensate&#xD;
image was dear, because it told of a grief such as hers. Now,&#xD;
~ after she dipped her pen in the standish, she paused to contem-&#xD;
plate it,-the red~ light bathing it in a life-like glow,-and the&#xD;
blood receded from her face, as she uttered aloud its touc~iing&#xD;
complaint, "Et mon coeur I"&#xD;
* Writing a note to Mr. Derrnott, in which, without stating her.&#xD;
reasons, 'she declined his~ offer, she dispatched it by one of her&#xD;
own servants, lately promoted to the office of Abigail, and attired&#xD;
herself for a walk. It was Saturday, and the weather faultless.&#xD;
A sigh of relief escaped her when she was in the outer air-she&#xD;
was free for a while. The streets were densely peopl~'d~-Aash-&#xD;
ing ladies, and marble-playing urchins, glorying in the holiday;&#xD;
bustling, pushing men, and lazy nurses lugging fat babies; and&#xD;
through the incongruous crowd the pale thinker threaded her&#xD;

N&#xD;
&#xD;
iut of their individual personality, with this difference.--they&#xD;
seemed happy in their selfishness; she was miserable in her iso-&#xD;
lation. She did not see that Pemberton passed l~er with a stiff&#xD;
bow, which, in punishment for her non-recognition, he resolved&#xD;
should be exchanged for a decided "cut" at their next meeting;&#xD;
did not catch Mr. Purcell's eye, as forgetting"iier rebuff in his&#xD;
pleasure at espying one, who could rightly value the prize he had&#xD;
discovered in an antiquated volume, musty with age, he beckoned&#xD;
to her from the door of the bookstore; did not hear Emma Olenn's&#xD;
modest "Good morning, Miss~ Ida," although she liked the child,&#xD;
and would have loved her if she had dared. She turned from&#xD;
the busy thoroughfare into an unfrequeiited street, keeping the&#xD;
same rapid pace;. the mind was working, the body must be mov-&#xD;
ing too-on, still on, with unflagging speed.-.'till she found her-&#xD;
self upon the summit of the hill overlooking the lower part of.&#xD;
the city, and near the old churchyard. She stopped, and looked&#xD;
in. A flight of steps led up to the burying-ground, several feet&#xD;
above the level of the walk. What. tempted her to ascend?&#xD;
She had been there before, and was not interested-~---yet the irre-&#xD;
solution ended in her entrances It was very still in that Acro-&#xD;
polis of the dead: the long grass, yellow in the October sUn,&#xD;
waved without rustling; the sere leaves drifted silently to the&#xD;
ground; from the mash of buildings below her arose only a&#xD;
measured beat rather than' hum-.--as regular, and not louder&#xD;
than the "muffled drum" within her bosom. The warring el-&#xD;
inents of discord sank into a troubled rest but their conflict was&#xD;
easier to be borne than the reaction\that succeeded.&#xD;
"Free' among the dead;'~ forgotten. as they, she sat upon a&#xD;
broken tombstone, in the shadow of' the venerable church, with&#xD;
sorrowful eyes which looked beyond the city, the river, and the&#xD;
undulating low-grounds skirting its banks.&#xD;
She had said to herself an hundred times, "T cannot be happy;&#xD;
it is folly to hope." But this morning she felt she had never&#xD;
until now relinquished hope; that despair, for the first time,&#xD;
stalked through the deserted halls of her heart, and the dreaded&#xD;
echo "alo~ae", answered his footsteps.&#xD;
It is easy to give up the world, with its xi~iillion sources of&#xD;
delight, to share the adverse fortunes of one dearer than all 'its&#xD;

A click of the ga~te-latcli, and voices warned her that her soli-&#xD;
tude was about to be invaded. "I will wait here half an hour,"&#xD;
said 4~amiliar tones. "Thank you," was the reply;" "you need&#xD;
not st{ay longer; if she is at home I shall spend the day." "Very&#xD;
well ~' good bye," and Carry Carlton ran up the steps. Retreat&#xD;
was impossible, for their eyes met at once, and to the new visitor&#xD;
the meeting appeared to give satisfaction.&#xD;
"[ am, indeed, fortunate," said she, saluting Ida, and taking&#xD;
a place beside her, "I expected to pass a solitary half-hour. One&#xD;
of the girls came with me to the gate. She has gone to see her&#xD;
aunt, and may not return to-day. This is a favorite spot of mine.&#xD;
I am laughed at for the choice, yet it seems I am not as singular&#xD;
as thGy would have me believe. Do you come here often ?"&#xD;
"This is only my second visit."&#xD;
"Indeed! But it is a long walk from your house. I live&#xD;
nearer, although on the other hill."&#xD;
"I understood you were from the country," said Ida.&#xD;
"So I am-but my sister resides here, and hers is another&#xD;
home to me. I love the country, yet I like Richmond. It&#xD;
is a beautiful city," she continued, her glance roving over the&#xD;
landscape.&#xD;
"Outwardly-yes."&#xD;
"You do not think the inhabitants adapted to their abode,&#xD;
then ?"&#xD;
"I do not know that they are worse than the rest of mankind.&#xD;
It is a matter of ~stonishment to me, that this globe should have&#xD;
been set apart as the theatre for so depraved a race."&#xD;
"I don't know," said Carry, cheerily. "I find it a nice world&#xD;
-the best I am acquainted with; and the people harmless, good&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
creatures-some dearer to me than others; but I entertain a&#xD;
fraternal affection for all."&#xD;
"I have read of philanthropists," said Ida; "but you are the&#xD;
sole specimen I have seen. And this universal iove-~-~is it con-&#xD;
tent to exist without a reciprocation ?"&#xD;
"The heart would be soon emptied were this so," returned&#xD;
the other, her bright face becoming serious. "There are many&#xD;
who love ~me~ if any dislike, I am in blissful ignorance of the&#xD;
sentiment and its cause."&#xD;
"But if your friends were m~emoved, and replaced by enemies ?"&#xD;
"I would teach them friendship. My affection for the dead&#xD;
would make me more desirous to benefit the living."&#xD;
"And if they would not be conciliated-if upon the broad&#xD;
earth you had not an answering spirit ?"&#xD;
"I should die !"&#xD;
"How then do I live ?" nearly burst from Ida's heart, but&#xD;
she smothered it, and replied, "It is easier to speak of death&#xD;
than to brave it."&#xD;
"Death! did I say death ?" exclaimed Carry. "I saw life&#xD;
as it wo~tld be were I bereft of father, sister, friends-and I said&#xD;
truly thiLt it would not be worth the keeping-but death! I&#xD;
would not rush on tkat! I have such a horror of ~the winding-&#xD;
sheet and the worm 1" She shivered. I&#xD;
"Yet you like to be here ?"&#xD;
"Yes. This is a sunny, cheerful place, with no fresh graves&#xD;
to remind one that the work of destruction is still going on. I&#xD;
love life. Others may expose its deceits, and weep above its&#xD;
withered blooms; I see blue sky were they fancy clouds. It&#xD;
is the day-the time for action and enjoyment; wh? would&#xD;
hasten the coming of the night-impenetrable.--dawnles~ 1"&#xD;
"'To die-and go-we know not where!"'&#xD;
quoted Ida. "That line conveys all that I fear in death. There&#xD;
have been seasons when the uncertainty shrouding the abyss&#xD;
beyond alone prevented my courting its embrace. Were it&#xD;
eternal forgetfulness, how grateful would be its repose! Looking&#xD;
around me here, I think of calm sleepers under these stones,&#xD;
hands folded meekly upon bosoms that will never heave again;&#xD;

"You are too young to coet this dreamless slumber," stdd&#xD;
Carry "With your talents and facilities you have a work to&#xD;
do in this woild."&#xD;
"What can I do? andfor whom ?"&#xD;
"Why-for every body."&#xD;
"Too wide a scope~~-~define. For example, what are my school.&#xD;
duties, setting aside my studies ?"&#xD;
~" We can help each other," was the modest rejoinder. "We&#xD;
can impart pleasure, and avoid giving pain. Not a day passes&#xD;
in which we cannot add a drop of sweet to the appointed draught&#xD;
of some one of our fellow-creatures."&#xD;
"Apropos to honey-it suggests its opposite, gall, and our&#xD;
ci-devant professor. I have not thanked you for your generous&#xD;
interference in my behalf, on the day of our fracas," said Ida,&#xD;
with an ease and cordiality that surprised herself.&#xD;
"You magnify the favor. I spoke the truth. To withhold&#xD;
it would have been dishonesty."&#xD;
"Dishonesty 1"&#xD;
"Your character for veracity was assailed. I had the proof&#xD;
which would ~establish it. I should have felt like a receiver of&#xD;
stolen goods had I concealed it."&#xD;
"Moreover, to your ~philanthropy, I was not an individual,&#xD;
but the jmpersonation of the sisterhood ;" said Ida, jestingly.&#xD;
" rhaps so," returned Carry, in a like strain. "You remem-&#xD;
ber the 'Young Ladies' Female meeting."'&#xD;
"That was a piece of Ellen Morris' grandiloquence. Do you&#xD;
know, Lenvy that girl her faculty of creating mirth wherever&#xD;
she goes I"&#xD;
"I had rather be Emma Glenn," said Carry. "On~ is witty,&#xD;
the other affectionate, and they will receive respectively admira-&#xD;
tion and love."&#xD;
"I do not ~quite agree with you. Ellen's high spirits will&#xD;
carry her through many a sharp battle, from which Emma'8&#xD;
sensitive nature would never recover. To combat with the.&#xD;
world one should have no heart; and I heard a clergyman once&#xD;
* say that a woman had no use for sense."&#xD;
Carry laughed. "Betwe7en you, you would represent us as a&#xD;
supei~fiuous creation. Yet woman has her sphere, no less than&#xD;
man; and if he conquers in his by might of purpose and brute&#xD;

strength, she guides, instead of rules in hers, by love and sub-&#xD;
mission. As for the world, that semi-fabulous ogre, supposed&#xD;
to live somewhere, all out of doors, whose cold charities are pro-&#xD;
verbial; who eats up widow' houses, and grinds the poor; w~&#xD;
have no dealings with it. It is, to my.notion, an innocent bug-&#xD;
bear, kept by the men, to prevent us from nieddling in their&#xD;
business matters; and to melt flinty-hearted wives into pity for&#xD;
one, who has been fighting this monster all day, and has now to&#xD;
drink smoked tea, and eat burnt toast for supper."&#xD;
"Are you ever sad ?" questioned Ida.&#xD;
"Not often, why do you ask ?"&#xD;
j' You appear so light-hearted. I was at a loss to determine&#xD;
whether it was natural or feigned."&#xD;
"My spirits are good, chiefly from habit, I believe. My&#xD;
father is remarkably cheerfQl. It is~a maxim of his, that we&#xD;
are unjust, when we cause others to do penance for our humors,&#xD;
they have trouble enough of their own to bear. Controlling the&#xD;
manifestations of temper and discontent, is generally followed&#xD;
by the suppression of the feelings themselves. It has been so&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"See that burlesque of tife 1" said Ida, pointing. "Children&#xD;
turning somersets upon a tomb-stone I"&#xD;
The tomb was built with four brick walls, supporting a&#xD;
horizontal tablet; and upon this flat surface, the irreverent&#xD;
youngsters were gambolling. One, the most agile, and the&#xD;
leader~ of the troop, w~s, as~ he spoke, in the act of performing&#xD;
a vehemently encored feat, viz.: ~throwing two somersets upon&#xD;
the marble, a in transitu for the ground, and . a fourth,&#xD;
after landing upon the turf. Two were accomplished in safety,&#xD;
the third was a flying leap, and he did not move afterwards.&#xD;
The children screamed, and the girls ran to the spot. In fall-&#xD;
ing, he had struck his head against a stone, and was senseless,&#xD;
the blood gushing from a wound in, or near the temple. Carry&#xD;
rested his head upon her arm, and with nervous haste, unbut-&#xD;
toned his collar. "Where are' his parents ?" inquired Ida. But&#xD;
they only cried the louder. "I fear he~ is killed !" said Carry.&#xD;
Ida shook her purse at the terrified group. "Who will bring&#xD;
me a doctor,-who, his mother ?" Her collected manner tended&#xD;
to quiet them, as much as the clink of coin. Half-a-dozen&#xD;

scampered in as many directions, and she ordered the rest off&#xD;
without ceremony. There was no rebellion. Each had a mis-&#xD;
giving that he was to blame for the casualty, and they were&#xD;
glad to skulk away.&#xD;
The handkerchief which Carry held to the gash, was saturated,&#xD;
and Ida supplied hers. He showed no sign of life, except that&#xD;
Ida imagined that she detected a feeble fluttering of the heart.&#xD;
Carry wept as though her heart would break. "Poor little fellow !"&#xD;
she exclaimed repeatedly. ]i~a did not shed, a tear, but her corn.&#xD;
pressed lips and contracted brow said this did not proceed from&#xD;
insensibility. "I cannot bear this suspense," she said. "I will&#xD;
look for a doctor myself, if you are not afraid to stay here alone."&#xD;
"No, go]"&#xD;
She met the medical man at the gate. It was Mr. Read's&#xD;
family physician, who chanced to be in the neighborhood. "Oh,&#xD;
Dr. Ballard !" exclaimed Ida. "I am rejoiced to see you 1"&#xD;
"And I am always happy to meet Miss Ross-.--.but what is&#xD;
this about a boy killed? None of your friends, I hope."&#xD;
Ida explained, as she led him to the scene of the disaster.' It&#xD;
seemed ill-timed to the agitated girls, to see him touch his hat&#xD;
with grave courtesy, to Carry, as he stopped to make an examina-&#xD;
tion. "He is not dead," he said, feeling the pulse and heart;&#xD;
"but it came near being an awkward hurt. Miss Ross, I will&#xD;
trouble you to call one of those boys, and send him for my ser-&#xD;
vant, who is in the street with my carriage. If I only had some&#xD;
soft linen 1" looking around. Ida took an embroidered scarf&#xD;
from her neck. He tore it into strips, rolled them into a ball,~&#xD;
and bound it tightly upon the cut. " Where does he live ?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
The. information was furnished by the boy's mother, who&#xD;
hurried up at this instant. She, with her reviving son, were put&#xD;
juto the carriage, and the doctor stepped in after them,&#xD;
The girls had no inclination to linger in the church-yard.&#xD;
The conversation, during their walk, ran upon the accident;&#xD;
1~ut as they parted at the corner of the streets diverging to their&#xD;
separate abodes, Carry expressed a strong desire fQr the cone&#xD;
tinuation of the acquaintance. "We have had an odd talk this&#xD;
niQrning;" said she smiling; "I would not have you regard it&#xD;
as a fair sample of my conversational powers.~~&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                        41&#xD;
Ida walked homeward with a lightened spirit. "Odd" as was&#xD;
their talk, and alarming as was the incident which interrupted&#xD;
it, she was better for both. There was ,a ~charm in Carry's&#xD;
frankness, which beg~iiled her confidence, and her cheerful phi-&#xD;
losophy was a pleasant, if not a prudent rule, for making one's&#xD;
way in life. She dwelt upon her declaration, that each day&#xD;
brought its opportunities for benevolent deeds; and her con-'&#xD;
soience responded joyfully to the appeal, "Have I contributed&#xD;
my drop of sweet to-day ?" by pointing to her exertions for the&#xD;
relief of the unknown sufferer. Carry had praised her presence&#xD;
of mind, and the doctor .complimented her warmly. "If I have&#xD;
not given pleasure, I have mitigated pain."&#xD;
The struck chord ceased to vibrate as sh~ reached the house&#xD;
where she had suffered~ and learned so much. When she came&#xD;
down to dinner, she w~s impassive and distant. Mr. Read vouch-&#xD;
safed to inquire if sh~ had seen Mr. Dermott. She replied in&#xD;
the negative.&#xD;
"I thought there was an arrangement to that. effect ;" said he,&#xD;
sneeringly.&#xD;
"I addressed a note to him which made his call unnecessary."&#xD;
"I do not presume. to meddle with your correspondence, Miss&#xD;
Ross;" with " immense" stiffness; "but I trust neither my name,&#xD;
or that of my daughter were contained in that communication."&#xD;
"1 am responsible for my actions, sir; it is certain I never&#xD;
thought of referring them to your influence. I suppose Mr.&#xD;
Dermott is satisfied,-J am."&#xD;

eager to examine what he esteemed worthy of their inspection,&#xD;
and to avoid that which he condemned. An artist visited the&#xD;
city, and advertised a set of *" choice paintings, on exhibition for&#xD;
a few days." They were much talked of and the scholars irupa-&#xD;
tiently listened for the verdict of their principal. 'There were&#xD;
many smiling faces, when he announced, that he accepted, with&#xD;
pleasure, the polite invitation of the artist to himself and the&#xD;
members of his school. "The pictures were the work of a master&#xD;
hand;-'--he recommended them to their careful study.". That&#xD;
afternoon, the studio was full. Some went from curiosity; some&#xD;
to be in the fashion; comparatively a small number through&#xD;
genuine love for the art. Among the latter class wa~ Ida&#xD;
Ross. Bestowing little notice 'upon her acquaintances present,&#xD;
she passed around the room, intent upon the object which had&#xD;
drawn her thither. She was not disturbed; her reserve repelled,&#xD;
and her intellectual superiority awed; she knew-and the knew&#xD;
that though with, she was not of them; as an institution~ they&#xD;
were proud of her; as individuals, with a very few exceptions,&#xD;
they disliked and envied her.&#xD;
The proprietor, or a gentleman, supposed to be he, wa~ at a&#xD;
desk, writing. He must have possessed the power of abstraction&#xD;
in an extraordinary degree; for the chattering about him, resem-&#xD;
bled tl~e.confabulations of a flock of magpies, more than the con-&#xD;
versation of decorous young ladies. Groups came and departed;&#xD;
and Ida did not mark the changes, until, diverted from the con-&#xD;
templation of a splendid landscape by the sound of her own&#xD;
name,-she perceived a group near by, compose-d of four or five&#xD;
girls and as many young men, none of them her well-wishers or&#xD;
admirers ;-tbeir attention divided between herself, and a sketch&#xD;
of St. John's church. Josephine was the magnet of the circle,&#xD;
and 'behind her, was the smirking. Pemberton. A single glance&#xD;
took in all this, and features and expression ~were immobile a~'&#xD;
before. It. was Josephine's voice she had heard ;-its tones&#xD;
higher than' usual. She neither desired, nor affected conceal-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"As I was saying, the church.yard has been converted into a&#xD;

U On Saturday last"-continued the narratQr~~U the unri-&#xD;
~    called troupe were in the midst of one of their most elaborate&#xD;
by the presence-I am&#xD;
~   performances, encouraged                    not sure, but&#xD;
~ assisted by a select company of spectators. I need only specify&#xD;
~ Miss Ross and friend, name unknown-to assure you of the high&#xD;
~ respectability of the assemblage. Smiled* upon by beauty, and&#xD;
~c animated to superhtuiian exertions by soft glances from one, per-&#xD;
 chance too dear to his youthful heart,-the chief of the baud&#xD;
1~ threw his whole soul into his lofty undertaking, and alas! his&#xD;
2'  body, also! He arose, like the Phoenix, from the ashes below,&#xD;
but to seek the earth again,,having fallen from the frightful&#xD;
~   height of three feet; He lay upon the sod without sense or&#xD;
motion. The spectators pressed around,-but, breaking through&#xD;
~ the throng, came the fair nymphs aforesaid. One pillowed his&#xD;
head upon her arm, and drenched his dusty brow with tears; her&#xD;
comrade wrung her hands, and shrieked for 'help! lest he die!'&#xD;
The crowd, at a respectful distance, looked on; venturing a whis-&#xD;
per, now and then, to the purport that 'it was as good as a play,&#xD;
and cost nothing.' Warm brine and sounding air are poor medi-&#xD;
# cines for a cracked skull; and the sufferer remaining insensible,&#xD;
a frantic damsel was seen, vaulting over tomb-stones, bonnetless&#xD;
i? and shawless, on the most direct route to the gate. A gallant&#xD;
man of healing was passing, and him she conducted to the pros.~&#xD;
~    trate hero. Handkerchiefs and scarfs were stripped from necks&#xD;
~ and arms to staunch the trickling gore; and supported by his&#xD;
affectionate nurses, the interesting youth gained, his carriage.&#xD;
Miss Ross returned home with swollen eyes and downcast air.&#xD;
The afternoon, evening, and most of the next day were spent in&#xD;
retirement. This was a grief sympathy could not assuage."&#xD;
"Did she tell you of it ?" asked one~&#xD;
"No. Madam Rumor is my informant, and her story is&#xD;
vouched for by a gentleman, an eye witness ~f the catastrophe."&#xD;
In this lamentable caricature, there was so little truth, and so&#xD;
much less wit, that it should have been beneath the contempt- of&#xD;
her, at whom it was aimed; but the ridicule was public. Her&#xD;
bonnet hid her face, but the angry blood surged over her x~eck in&#xD;
crimson streams. There was vengeful fury enough in the&#xD;
grasp, which drove the nails through the paper she held,. i~to&#xD;
the, palm, to have swept the tittering clique from the earth a~ a&#xD;

stroke. Whatever purpose of retaliation sprung into life, it was&#xD;
nipped in the bud. The desk of the supposed artist was in a&#xD;
niche; and the projecting wall concealed it from. the view of the&#xD;
party. 'He was almost in front of her; and her burning eyes&#xD;
were arrested as they encountered his. There was no scorn, or&#xD;
none for her, ip that regard; but warning, interest and inquiry&#xD;
were blended #ith such earnestness, that, like the charmed bird,&#xD;
she could not/move or look away~ Even when he cast his eyes&#xD;
upon his wo~'k again, ~he did not, at once, withdraw hers. He&#xD;
xmght have been thirty; pale, and not handsome, yet anythingg&#xD;
but ordinary in his appearance. If. his countenance had be-&#xD;
trayed emotion, the previous moment, it vanished as his pen&#xD;
began to move. He was the automaton scribe, and the subdued&#xD;
Ida, drawing her shawl around her, quitf~ed the place, without&#xD;
exchanging a syllable with any one.&#xD;
The spell of the silent, rebuke was speedily dissolved, yet she&#xD;
was grateful that it had restrained her ha sty retort. The heated&#xD;
in a quarrel, are always the defeated. Morbid sensibility is the&#xD;
engendered of suspicion,-and vice versa; the two act and react,&#xD;
until a smile, a look, is the foundation of weeks-it may be, of&#xD;
years of wretchedness. To such a ifiind, ridicule is a venomed&#xD;
dart, piercing and poisoning, and pride but inflames the wound.&#xD;
~ Dr. Ballard had showed the courtesy of a gentleman, and the&#xD;
kindness of a friend in. his intercourse with Ida. Unconsciously,&#xD;
she had come to like, almost to 'trust him.-.and this was at an&#xD;
end. lie, and he, only, could have provided the outline of the&#xD;
narrative she had heard. She set her teeth hard, as she recalled&#xD;
her agitated greeting, at the gate; and his composl~re; her&#xD;
subsequent offers of assistance.-" officious"-she called them&#xD;
now,-and his calm acceptance. ABut it was base and unmanly,&#xD;
to make capital for sport of the weakness of a woman-a child,&#xD;
compared with himself! "They are all alike-I must believe&#xD;
it! with hearts rotten to the core! Heaven have mercy on me,&#xD;
until I am as callous as they !" And when he called, at some&#xD;
personal inconvenience, to impart the intelligence of her&#xD;
"protege's" recovery, she met him with ~ haughtiness that sur-&#xD;
prised and angered him; andihis futile attempt to throw down&#xD;
the barrier, resulted in his cutting short the interview, lie had&#xD;
told Mr. Read of Ida's adventure; but not in the spirit in which&#xD;

~y, its events were coarsely retailed. He lauded her kindness and&#xD;
$~ self-possession, in terms too extravagant to suit the zero humanity&#xD;
of her guardian's narrow soul ;~-as he wound up the story to his&#xD;
daughter-he "was not a man to get up a fit of heroics, and had.&#xD;
no idea that Ballard had so much 'palaver about him."&#xD;
If this vile doctrine were indeed true if all men were alike,&#xD;
and like him, who of us would not unite in: the orphan's prayer&#xD;
1..&#xD;
'~ -would not cry, with her, in despairing bitterness, U Heaven&#xD;
have mercy upon us, until we are all as callous as t~hey 1"&#xD;
She had no mercy upon herself. There was an unholy joy in&#xD;
ruthlessly trampling upon the few flowers that grew in her, path:&#xD;
the ebullition of a desperate despair, as when one is tortured by&#xD;
a raging tooth, he probes, and grinds and shakes the offending&#xD;
member, self-inflicting yet more exquisite pain, lint bearing it&#xD;
better, under the insane impression that he is wreaking revenge&#xD;
upon its cause; saying, with the poor Dutchman, "ache on!&#xD;
ache ~onII can stand it as long as you can 1" And "ache* on!&#xD;
ache on 1" said Ida to h)er heart, "the nerve will be dead by and&#xD;
by!"&#xD;
We consign to the lower pit of darkness the bloody demons,&#xD;
cloaked in priestly stole, and "speaking great, swelling words of&#xD;
wisdom" and peace, who tore limb from limb upon the rack, in&#xD;
"zeal for the Faith 1" but for him who pours out his atheistical&#xD;
misantrophy,-deaden'ing, petrifying the soul, and blinding the&#xD;
eyes, until in this, our lovely earth, they see but ~t mighty char-&#xD;
nel-house, full of nameless abominations' who traduces God, in&#xD;
despising His noblest work, and says: ." Behold ~he Truth !" the&#xD;

Carry Carleton's liking for the company of " that, proud,&#xD;
disagreeable girl," and hez~ defence of her when attacked, was a,&#xD;
nine days' wonder. True, "she loved everybody," but here 'she&#xD;
manifested partiality, far more than accorded 4ith her school-&#xD;
mates' notions of justice and reason. Carry was unwavering.&#xD;
"I like her," said she, one recess, when her corps of affectionate&#xD;
teazers hung on. and about her. "It wounds me to hear you&#xD;
speak disparagingly 'of her. You must admit that she has&#xD;
redeeming traits. She is one of our best scholars, an&amp;amp; if in-&#xD;
accessible, is upright and honorable, and will not stoop to do an&#xD;
ignoble potion."&#xD;

" Yes," said Emma Glenn, happy to add her; ~nite of praise,&#xD;
"Don't you remember she *found Julia Mason s composition&#xD;
behind a desk in the cloak room, and brought it in examination&#xD;
day, although she knew that she was her most .dangei~ous com-&#xD;
petitor for the prize; I'm afraid I should h~ve been tempted 'to&#xD;
keep it, or leave it-where it was.,&#xD;
"I should not be afraid to 'trust you, dear," said Carry.&#xD;
"You are to. ready too coil~mend such conduct in others, to act a&#xD;
contrary part yourself. As for Ida-have any of you reflected&#xD;
how much of what you call her pride you are accountable for ?"&#xD;
"We! how ?" was the unanimous exclamation.&#xD;
"I know my misdeeds are legion, and 'my good works, like&#xD;
Parson Wilkins' text, 'way off and hard to find,' but 'evil,"&#xD;
indeed, as well as 'f~ew, have been the years of my pilgrimage,'&#xD;
if Iliad anything to do with 'the ~~formation 'of Ida Ross' char-&#xD;

"Ellen! Ellen !" remonstrated Carry, "think what effect a&#xD;
remark' like that would produce! Would it increase her confi-&#xD;
dence in you or us ?~ Would she not avoid us more then ever?&#xD;
She is an orphan, and should be dealt 'with more charitably, than&#xD;
if her feelings had expanded in a home like yours."&#xD;
"You do not believe she could love anybody !" said one of th~e&#xD;
group..&#xD;
"Certainly I do, and I mean she shall love me~ You would&#xD;
make the same resolution, if you ~knew her as I do."&#xD;
"An idea stri1~es me, Carry," said the incorrigible Ellen.-..&#xD;
"She and we have affinity for each other-water and oil-you&#xD;
dare the alkali, which' is to reconcile us; we shall be a soap&#xD;
manufactory, to cleanse and regenerate the world."&#xD;
"A little vinegar facilitates the process, does it not ?" asked&#xD;
Carry, good-humoredly.&#xD;
"You have come to a poor market for it, my good Alkali;&#xD;
upon second thoughts, you must leave me out of the combination&#xD;
altogether-salt, Attic, particularly, being detrimental to the&#xD;
integrity of the article in question.~~&#xD;
"Soap boiling and Attica !" said Anna Talbot, who was read..&#xD;
ing a little~apart, "your conversation takes an extended range~&#xD;
to-day, young ladies."&#xD;
"'Both are warm places," returned Ellen. "Our imaginations&#xD;
&#xD;
~w   needed thawing after perching so long upon the North role,&#xD;
id est, Ida Roes."&#xD;
"You have offended Carry," said Emma, appr~ehensively, as&#xD;
~ the former walked towards the other room.&#xD;
"Not offended, but' grieved," she replied, with sweet gravity.&#xD;
"I should not love Ellen as I do, if I did not believe her heart&#xD;
to be oftener in th)e right place than her tongue."&#xD;
She passed in~to the recitation room, and there, her head bent&#xD;
upon a desk, was Ida! Carry was transfixed with dismay. The&#xD;
door was a.jar-she had heard it all! But the relaxed limbs-&#xD;
* the unmoving figure-was she then asleep? A minute's stay&#xD;
confirmed this opinion; and greatly relieved, she tripped lightly&#xD;
out by another door.' Ida did not sleep. She had left the larger&#xD;
room at the close of morning recitations, seeking in the com-&#xD;
parative quiet of this, some ease from a severe headache. She&#xD;
did not think of concealment. After the gossip of the thought..&#xD;
less circle turned upon herself, she still supposed that her&#xD;
vicinity was known; . that their pretended consciousness was a&#xD;
covering for a reneWal of fortifications. To move would have&#xD;
been matter for triumph, she was not disposed to supply. So&#xD;
unjust does suspicion make us!&#xD;
Carry's disinterested vindication electrified her. To risk the&#xD;
forfeiture of the favor of the many, for one who had never con-&#xD;
ferred an obligation-whose good will could profit her nothing I&#xD;
in her experience, the act lacked a parallel. "Can it be," she&#xD;
    thought, with stirring pulses, "can it be that. I may yet find a&#xD;
friend ?" then, as Carry's "I am resolved she shall love ~&#xD;
reached her, she bowed in thankfulness. 'Cl will trust! will&#xD;
stake my last hope of ever meeting a kindred spirit upon this&#xD;
throw-will let her love me' if she will, so help me God 1" It&#xD;
was no light vow.&#xD;
Carry's intrusion was unobserved; she was only sensible of the&#xD;
incalescence of her frozen heart. The afternoon was cloudy,&#xD;
and her maid was surprised to see her mistress preparing for her&#xD;
promenade.&#xD;
d, Miss Ida, you'll get caught in the shower; 'twont&#xD;
be no little sprinkle, neither. When its starts to rain this time&#xD;
o' year, it never holds up."&#xD;

-deluge, -I may as well be out of doors as in. But give me my&#xD;
cloak, Rachel, I must have a short run before it sets in."&#xD;
Josephine crossed the hall as she was going out. She stared,&#xD;
but made no remark upon her unseasonable excursion. It was&#xD;
less wonderful than the smile and nod she received. "It is&#xD;
pleasant," said Ida to herself, "yet they talked of rain I" But&#xD;
the storm was not to be delayed by inward sunshine. 'The&#xD;
smoky fog 'grew denser; through the ominous calm which per-&#xD;
'vaded the city, the' roaring of the distant "Falls" was distinctly&#xD;
audible; cows 'stood, solemnly herded together, the vapor from&#xD;
their nostrils scarcely thicker than the surrounding atmosphere;&#xD;
and an occasional rain..drop trickling round their roughened&#xD;
hides. Then the. pavement was spotted with~ the precursors of&#xD;
-the proguosticated deluge, and a dash of spray into Ida's face&#xD;
~restored 'her to the perception of her actual position: a mile from&#xD;
- -home, night and a tempest approaching. Ere a dozen steps&#xD;
were retraced, she was met by the shower,-November rain,&#xD;
cutting and numbing as hail. Her veil, flimsy defence for her&#xD;
face, was dripping in a moment, and the water streamed in&#xD;
-miniature cascades from her bonnet and shoulders. Bewildered&#xD;
and dizzy, she sprang, without a thought, except the instinct&#xD;
of self-preservation, into the shelter of a friendly porch. She&#xD;
-laughed, despite her uneasiness at her situation. "Wet, not&#xD;
,quite to the skin, but more damp than is comfortable; sans&#xD;
umbrella, over-shoes, carriage or servant, and where, I cannot&#xD;
precisely"determine."&#xD;
"Walk in, do /" said 'a pleasant voice behind her. A lady&#xD;
was holding the open door. "I thank you," Ida began, when a&#xD;
-figure glance~ out of 'the entry. '"Why, Ida! my dear creature!&#xD;
-how Wet you ~~re! don't stand there a moment. .1 am so .glad&#xD;
you ran in! This is my sister, Mrs. Dana-my -friend, Miss&#xD;
'Ross-now w~ will -go directly up stairs, and take off your damp&#xD;
things-!" and in the confusion of congratulations and regrets, Ida&#xD;
did itot know where she was, - until she was~ seated in Carry's&#xD;
room; both sisters occupied in divesting her of such portions of -&#xD;
her apparel, as were likely, 'by their -humidity, to endanger her&#xD;
health.&#xD;
"You are very kind," sne said; "but 'I cannot wait to have&#xD;
these dried. I must go home."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Impossible !" cried the impulsive Carry. "1 will not hear&#xD;
of it. Just make up your 'mind to stay in your present quarters&#xD;
until clear weather."&#xD;
"Let me insist upon your staying, Miss Ross ;" said ~rs.&#xD;
Dana. "I will send a messenger to your friends to infqrm them&#xD;
of your safety."&#xD;
* "She will stay," said Carry, looking very positive.&#xD;
Ida yielded with secret, pleasure. Her guardian angel must&#xD;
have guided her into this haven. Mrs. Dana was Carry's 'senior&#xD;
by ten years or more, and resembled her more in voice and ~nan*&#xD;
ncr, than feature. -They had the same' kind eyes and dimpling&#xD;
smile. Having seen her guest- comfortable, she gave her into&#xD;
Carry's charge, and went to forward her message to Mr. Read.&#xD;
"How it rains I" said Carry, drawing aside the curtain. "'It is~&#xD;
lucky 'you came when you did. Did you knoW 'we lived here ?"&#xD;
"No, it was entirely accidental. I was walking, and did not&#xD;
notice the clouds until the shower canie; then I took refuge in&#xD;
the nearest house."'&#xD;
"A happy accident for me," said Carry. "I despaired of&#xD;
ever persuading yo~t to visit~ ~ne. 'This storm was sent for my&#xD;
express benefit. Sister and- I are never tired of each other's&#xD;
company; but the little ones demaiid much of her time;&#xD;
and brother John-Mr. Dana, often ~bring~ home Writing, or&#xD;
is detained at the store late, at night, in the busy season, ~nd&#xD;
'I am rather lonely.":&#xD;
"You are bent upon convincing me that all the obligation is&#xD;
on your side,'! returned Ida: "but compare the mermaid-like&#xD;
fright which shocked you, -with the decent young lady. before&#xD;
you now, and recollect that my gratitude is ,proportionate to the'&#xD;
improvement."&#xD;
A pretty little girl, about five years-old,, crept into the room.&#xD;
"Come to aunt, Elle !". said Carry. "And speak to this&#xD;
lady." -&#xD;
The child came up timidly t9 Ida, and slid her plump han4&#xD;
into hers. She did not struggle, as she lifted her into her sap,&#xD;
but looked steadfastly at her, with her soft black eyes. "What&#xD;
is your name ?" asked Ida. -&#xD;
'KElinor Dana," she answered, in her dear, childish voice.&#xD;

"Elinor I" repeated Ida, and the little one felt herself pressed&#xD;
more closely to her breast."&#xD;
"Do you , likt~ it ?" .inquired Carry.&#xD;
"It was my mother's name I" was the low reply. Ele put&#xD;
up her lips for a kiss.. She saw a pained look flit over the&#xD;
countenance of the visitor, and administered the only panacea&#xD;
she possessed.&#xD;
"Is she your sister's oldest child ?" asked Ida, repaying the&#xD;
caress.&#xD;
"Yes. She h~s two younger; a boy and a girl. The babe is&#xD;
my namesake."&#xD;
"My brother is named Charles Arthur; after uncle Charley.&#xD;
and uncle Arthur" ventured Bile.&#xD;
"And you love him very dearly,-do you not ?" said Ida.&#xD;
"Yes ma'ain; I love papa and mamma, and aunt Carry, and&#xD;
uncle 'Charley, and'iilicle Arthur, and grandpa, and sister and&#xD;
brother," said the child, running over the names~Vith a volu-&#xD;
bility that showed how used she was to the repetition.&#xD;
"'Will you love me too ?" asked Ida. The anxiety with which&#xD;
she awaited the reply will not be sneered at by those who have&#xD;
been, like her, starvelings in affection.&#xD;
"Yes, you too, but I don't know what to call you."&#xD;
." My name is Ida."&#xD;
"Miss Ida, or. cousin Ida ?"&#xD;
"Cousin !" exclaim                   .     . "Call me&#xD;
cousin!" claims*   ed Ida, catching at the word&#xD;
as relatives, all whom she loves," observed Carry;&#xD;
"and we encourage her in the practice.. Miss iB formal;' and the&#xD;
absence of any such prefix gives a disrespectful air to a child's&#xD;
address."&#xD;
" She speaks of her uncles. Have you brothers ?"&#xD;
"She alludes to Mr. Dana's brot~iers," said Carry, with a&#xD;
Blight blush, which Ida remembered I afterwards. "They were&#xD;
wards of my father's; and we regard them as a part ~f the&#xD;
family."&#xD;
Ida amused herself by coaxing forth BIle's prattle; and&#xD;
related, as reward for her sociability, a marvellous fairy tale,~&#xD;
which expanded her 'eyes to their utmost circle, and 'interested'&#xD;
even Carry. N[rs. Dana entered at the finale.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Papa has come, Elle, arid would be happy to see Miss Ross.&#xD;
Tea 4is ready, too. I hope she has not annoyed you,"-to Ida.&#xD;
"Annoyed I oh no, ma'am! we are good friends, and have had.&#xD;
a nice, talk, have we not, darling?"&#xD;
,Playing with a child is a very peurile ~tmusement~'-what room&#xD;
is there for the exercise of the reasoning faculties; ~hat' oppor-&#xD;
tunity for gaining new views of the world or of ~truth? ~til1&#xD;
Ida was happier, and she was silly enough to think, wiser. 'A&#xD;
germ was set, which should be developed by and by.&#xD;
Mr. Dana was in the supper-room. He was tall and dark;&#xD;
grave-looking when silent; but as he acknowledged the intro-&#xD;
duction to herself, and stooped to kiss Elle, his smile x~enderea&#xD;
him exceedingly J~andsome. The proud tenderness of his wife&#xD;
was beautiful to behold* and he unbent all that was stern in his&#xD;
'nature, in her presence, or Carry's. The repast went off delight-&#xD;
fully. There were no sarcastic flings at society and~individuals,&#xD;
and clash of combat; impei'fectly drowned by courteous phrase-&#xD;
ology, such as characterized similar occasions at Mr. Read's.&#xD;
Free to act and speak, without dread of criticism, Ida acquitted&#xD;
herself well. She and her entertainers were equally charmed;&#xD;
and Carry sat' by, contented with the success of her benevolent&#xD;
efforts. Mr. IDana's business required his attention, immediately&#xD;
after, supper; Mrs. IDana sat with the girls awhile, theii repaired&#xD;
to her nursery. "We shall not be troubled by visitors tonightt"&#xD;
said Carry. "What say you to adjourning to our chamber? It&#xD;
is more snug than these empty parlors."&#xD;
They visited the nursery in their way. Bile opened ncr eyes.&#xD;
as her friend kissed her coral lips, but their lids fell again&#xD;
directly, and her "good night" died in a drowsy murmur. The&#xD;
boy was sleeping soundly, and little Carry' lay quietly wakeful&#xD;
upon her mother's lap. "These are my treasures," said the&#xD;
fond parent, smiling at Ida's admiration of the group."&#xD;
"Treasures she would Dot barter for the wealth of both&#xD;
Indies," ad4ed Carry "You are a diplomatist,' Ida, you have&#xD;
found sister's blind side by praising her pets."&#xD;
"You, who are so accustomed to these pretty playthings, do&#xD;
not know how lovely they are to one who is not so favored,"&#xD;

tinued she, when they were in their room, taking from a ward&#xD;

And cozily comfortable they appeared, ensconced in arm-&#xD;

apples and nuts sent up by the thoughtful Mrs. Dana, on a&#xD;
stand between them; shutters and curtains closed&#xD;
~roaring and driving without.                and the storm&#xD;
~ "I no longer wonder at your 3~ieerfulness, since, I have seen&#xD;
your home," said Ida. "All the g~od things of life are mingled&#xD;
in yourcup."&#xD;
* "You are right, I am very happ~r, but not more so than hun-&#xD;

pleasure thus far, whether it will endure tl~e test of time and&#xD;

"Fair logic; but let us examine facts. Take an example so&#xD;
frequently cited, as to appear hacknied, yet none the less true&#xD;
to nature. Your wealth, or situation, or influence enables ~QU&#xD;
to benefit those who style themselves your friends. You are&#xD;
courted, beloved, popular. A change in the~e adventitious cir-&#xD;
cumstances alters everything. With unabated desires for - love&#xD;
or distinction, you are a clod of the earth, a cumberer of the&#xD;
ground. The stream of adulation flows in another direction;&#xD;
former acquaintances pass you with averted eyes, or chilling&#xD;
recognition; you are sought by no new ones. . Men do not go&#xD;
to a barren tree, or a dried fountain, You shake your head ;-.&#xD;
this is not a fancy sketch. Listen to a leaf from my history.&#xD;
Until two years ago I never received a harsh~6rd, or an unlov-&#xD;
ing look. My mother was the benefactress of the poor, for&#xD;
miles around, and I was~ her almoner. Blessings and smiles&#xD;
hailed me wherever I went. I had no conception of sorrows&#xD;
~lie could not alleviate; and I remember Winking-foolish child&#xD;
that I was! that her empire of hearts was worth the glory of an&#xD;
Alexander or Napoleon. She died! and where are the~fruits of&#xD;
her loving kindness? If her memory lives in another breast&#xD;
than thai of her' only child, I do not know it 1"&#xD;
There were tears in, Carry's eyes, already, and the slight&#xD;
tremor of her speech wa~ grateful music to the orphan's ear.&#xD;
"You quitted your home, and all who knew her and came&#xD;
tio a strange city, where it was necessary for you to earn love as&#xD;
she had done. I have no doubt, nay, I am sure, that by, the&#xD;
creatui'es of her bounty, her memory is preserved as a holy&#xD;
thing; and that they are ready to extend the affection they~ had'&#xD;
for her, to her child. Herej~lie was comparatively unkn4~wn..&#xD;
To carry out your metaphor 6T~ the tree;~ the graft cut from the&#xD;
parent stock must bear fruit for itself. .11 know the world is&#xD;
generally selfish, but I am convinced that our reprobation of it&#xD;
often arises from the growth of a similar weakness in ourselves.&#xD;

real state of your mind, or from an exacting spirit in yourself?&#xD;
Pardon my freedom.; it is meant in kindness."&#xD;
"I thank you for your candor. ~he truth, if unpalatable,&#xD;
cannot offend.'&#xD;
"Then, trusting to your forbearance, I will go more into par-&#xD;
ticulars. To curry favor, in school, or elsewhere, is as repugnant&#xD;
to me as tQ you; but do we sacrifice s&amp;amp;lf~respect, by swaying&#xD;
to the popular voice, when no abandonment of principle is&#xD;
required? or play' the hypocrite, in concealing prejudices and&#xD;
humor~ that conflict with the sentiments of otl~ers; in uniting,&#xD;
with apparent willingness, in the common cause? We cannot&#xD;
like-we may help all. I sa~r it in humility-there is one rule&#xD;
by which I do not fear to be judged:. 'Whatsoever ye would&#xD;
that men should ~do unto you, do ye even so to them."'&#xD;
"I understand your allusions. You think my reserve pro-&#xD;
ceeds from pride alone. What if I were to tell you"..-and her&#xD;
voice sank, "that haughty as I seem, I would cringe.-.4ie in the&#xD;
dust-to the most inferior of my daily companions, if she would&#xD;
give me love. Believe me, it is thtis unquenchable thirst-this&#xD;
longing for what isunattainable by me, which has forced me to&#xD;
court its opposite-hate! I will not lay my heart bare to tho~e&#xD;
who would spurn it. It is said, the hind seeks an obscure covert,&#xD;
to die from tho wound for which his unhurt comrades would&#xD;
shun him. You cannot know-it would be improper for ~me to&#xD;
recount my fruities~ endeavors to win the coveted blessing, at&#xD;
any price, even the loss of the .self-respect you imagine I value&#xD;
so highly. It is enQugh that experiences, such as I hope may&#xD;
never be yours, have taught me to~ entrench myself in my for-&#xD;
tress of ~elf-confidence, from whence I burl disdain upon besieg-&#xD;
ing powers. I am thought independent; the worki has made&#xD;
me so. . No woman is independent from nature or choice."&#xD;
Carry looked musingly in the fire. "I am not certain," she&#xD;
said, "that I have a right to repeat what was told me, by one&#xD;
who never thought that you would hear it. I do not see, how-&#xD;
ever, that it can do harm, and I wish to show you, that I am&#xD;
n~t of some of your trials. A friend of mine, whose&#xD;
in~ .i~xL~"' not at liberty to mention, was in F~-'5 paint-&#xD;

his desk while Mr. F-- should seek recreation. He was an&#xD;
auditor of Josephine's Read's garbled story of our church-yard&#xD;
adventure he had heard a true statement from me. Had my&#xD;
name been used, as it would have been if she had known who&#xD;
your companion was, he would have spoken. As it was, his indig-&#xD;
nation'nearly got the better of his prudence. He identified you&#xD;
as the heroine of the tale, by the significant gestures and winks&#xD;
of the ill-mannered party, and commended your equanimity and&#xD;
forbearance."&#xD;
"He 'did not add, that his timely warning suppressed the&#xD;
responsive storm ?" said Ida.&#xD;
"Why I did he speak ?"&#xD;
"No. He only looked? but such a look I"&#xD;
Carry laughed. "He is a strange mortal! But to return to&#xD;
yourself.,. These exhibitions of depravity and cold-heartedness,&#xD;
are not adapted to raise our estimate of mankind; yet even&#xD;
then there was one present, who was on the side of riglft and&#xD;
humanity; who saw no cause for mirth in the sufferings of a&#xD;
child, or the anxieties of two inexperienced girls."&#xD;
"Dr. Ballard did, it seems," said Ida, the gloomy look&#xD;
returning.&#xD;
Did Josephine hear of the affair from him ?"&#xD;
"I supp9se so. Who else knew it ?"&#xD;
"True. But is it not more probable that she gave it her&#xD;
own coloring, than that he made a jest of us ?" We will lean&#xD;
towards mercy in our judgmer4."&#xD;
"You are a veritable alchemist," said Ida. "You would&#xD;
'ferret out gold, even in the dross of my character."&#xD;
"Try me I" replied Carry. "But bear in mind, nothing is&#xD;
to be secreted; no hard thoughts or jaundiced investigations.&#xD;
All must be cast into the crucible."&#xD;
* "And tried by what fire ?" in~ui~ed Ida.&#xD;
"Love I" said the warm-hearted girl, kneeling beside her,&#xD;
and ~nding her arms about her waist. "Love me, Ida! and&#xD;
if I prove heartless and deceitful, I will cease to plead for my&#xD;
brothers and sisters."&#xD;

"TnAorr me to ~in hearts as you do I" Ida prayed, on the&#xD;
memorable evening ~f the storm, and Carry answered, blithely,&#xD;
"Love, and live for ~thers I"&#xD;
To her, natural disposition and practice made the task easy;&#xD;
for her pupil, it was arduous beyond her worst expectation. her&#xD;
reputation was established; the wall, she had erected between&#xD;
herself and her associates, was not to be undermined ~r scaled&#xD;
in a day. flier overtures of familiarity and service was nuskil..&#xD;
fully '~iade; her very timidity construed into a labored con.&#xD;
descension. "lit is a hopeless endeavor.~.....they will never care&#xD;
for me I" said she, desponding1y......0~~~ and again, 'and Carry&#xD;
still predicted.....~~ Love will win love, Persevere I" The birth&#xD;
and growth of their attachment was remarkable. Dissimilar in&#xD;
mind; made more so in manner, by education and circumstances,&#xD;
there existed from the earliest stage of their friendship, perfect&#xD;
confidence in each other's aflbction. Carry had an infallible&#xD;
perception of genuine worth, hidden* though it might be; and&#xD;
Ida clung drowningly to this last anchor.......the sole tie that con~&#xD;
nected her with her race, Like most deep feelings, its current&#xD;
was noiseless. They Were much togetherp.....tha~ was not strange,&#xD;
since their studies were the $ame. They had separate compart.&#xD;
nients of one desk; and none marked how often one book was&#xD;
conned by both; brown and fair curls zninglin~; and hands&#xD;
clasped in mute tenderness. Still less did they dream of the&#xD;
miraculous confluence of the sun.bright stream with the turbid&#xD;
torrent, and the wondrous music of their flow.&#xD;
They Were sitting thus one forenoon, when an assistant teacher&#xD;
drew~ near, and inquired if there were a vacant seat in their&#xD;
Vicinity.&#xD;
"A new scholar I" buzzed from fifty tongues; and the eyes&#xD;
of our two students strayed with the rest, to the door.&#xD;

She was short and fat-i' dumpy," in vulgar parlance; and so&#xD;
homely, as to countenance Ellen Morris' report to another&#xD;
department-" that the farmers in the neighborhood where she&#xD;
was 'riz,' had fbrwarded a ~etitiOfl, beseeching her to return,&#xD;
thcir corn having~ suffered greatly from the depredations of the&#xD;
crows ~iuoe her departure; a thing unheard of, previously) in&#xD;
that part of the country." Her eyes were small and grey; her&#xD;
nose a ruddy "snub;" her lips curiously puckered up; and her&#xD;
skin might have owed its dappled red to the drippings of the&#xD;
carroty fri~ette overshadowing it. Her dress was showy and&#xD;
outr6; a rainbow silk trebly.flouiiced an embroidered lace cape;&#xD;
white kid gloves; a gold cable of startling dimensiojis; two&#xD;
bracelets of corresponding site, and different patterns; a brooch&#xD;
that matched neither, and out.glittered both; whtle blue, green,&#xD;
and red stones, with heavy settings, loaded the thick fingers to&#xD;
the knuckles.&#xD;
Awe of their preoqptor in some, good breGding in others,&#xD;
prevented any audible outbreak of amusement; but what school&#xD;
girl on the qu~ tn~ve for diversion, could keep from smiling? Mi'.&#xD;
Purcell frowned as his eye travelled from one nrirth1~ul face to&#xD;
another, but a twinkle from Ellen Nilorris' dancing orl~s, neutra~&#xD;
lized the effort; and there was a perceptible twich of his risible&#xD;
muscle as he rapped for "order." Ida and Carry had not&#xD;
escaped the contagion, an indulgence for which they reproached&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
"Poor girl I" whispered Carry. "She knows no better. She&#xD;
is to be pitied instead of laughed at." And Ida thought 'of her&#xD;
loneliness, upon her induction into these strange scenes. "I can&#xD;
lesson her discomfort, and, uninfluenced by prejudice, she will be&#xD;
thankful, perhaps will become fond of me."&#xD;
Carry rea* her resolve in her thoughtful survey of the stran.&#xD;
ger; but while she loved and honoured her for it, her heart&#xD;
misgave her as she looked more attentively at the object of the&#xD;
purposed charity. Her physiogonomy was not more irregular&#xD;
than unpleasant in its expression. She bad opened ~ book, to be&#xD;
in the fashion in this as in every thing else,'but her regards were&#xD;
wandering around the room in scared yet unblushing curiosity,&#xD;
flustered at being in a crowd, without a doubt as to her ability&#xD;
to cope with the best of them. liefore the exercises of the&#xD;

to go into.a small room, where bonnets and cloaks Were hung,&#xD;
*   found her standing atthe window,' crying  She wheeled about&#xD;
sharply on hearing a step;~ her eyes swelled almost out of 2ight,&#xD;
and her whole appearance frightful in its disorder.&#xD;
"What do you want ?" she asked, querulously.&#xD;
"I did not know you were here," said Ida. "Wh is the&#xD;

"No. My pa's is gone away I" A&#xD;

flonplussed in casting about in her mind for appropriate console&#xD;

1nol~thing the word magniloquently.&#xD;
"A-what ?"&#xD;
"lie belongs to the legislator. Lor! didn't you know that ?"&#xD;
"No," replied Ida, humbly; "I am so little conversant with&#xD;
State affairs. You will be glad to have him ~so near."&#xD;
"I don't care much about it; I want to go home and stay&#xD;
with ma I" beginning to sob. Neither her unpolished manners,&#xD;
nor her accent, combining, as it did, the most vicious of Virginia&#xD;
provincialism5, with the guturals of the African; nor her noisy.&#xD;
grief, could make Ida forget that she was a homesick child-...&#xD;
weeping for her mother! Ske too had mourned, and "refused&#xD;
to be .coniforted, because hers was not." Miss Pratt's sorrow,&#xD;
however, was very garrulous.&#xD;
"Now, at home," she continued, "I did jest as I pleased; I&#xD;
lay down most all day. Ma said reading was bad for my head;&#xD;
and so 'tis; it makes me as stupid as I don't know what; and&#xD;
aint no use besides. I can play on the pianny; gentlemen don't&#xD;

don't have no beaux. while you're at school, do you 7"&#xD;
Ida smiled at this unlocked for.query. "We do not have&#xD;
much leisure for amusements," she rejoined.&#xD;
"And can't you go ~o the theatre, and to~.shows and parties 7"&#xD;
asked Miss Pratt, alarmed.&#xD;
"There are no rules on the subject; but it is thought 'that a&#xD;
young lady is betteV fitted to go into society, when her mind and&#xD;
manners are formed by time and study."&#xD;
"Mine are enough formed, I know," complacently glancing&#xD;
from her attire to Ida's plain merino, and black silk apron.&#xD;
"Hew awful ugly all the girls dress! Aint none of 'em rich 7"&#xD;
" I believe so; but the school-girls here dress simply."&#xD;
"1 shan't!. My pa's able to give me decent clothes,' and I&#xD;
mean to have 'em. I don't like Richmond 'u single bit. Nobody&#xD;
don't take no more notice of me than if [wan't nobody-no&#xD;

"Y~Ai are not acquainted yet. There are some pleasant girls&#xD;
amongst us; and yow will love Mr. Purcell."&#xD;
"Is he strict, muoli? Doe~ he make you get hard lessons 7"&#xD;
"' He is ver~ kind and considerate."&#xD;
"I despise teachersr s and books. Thank patience! I am going&#xD;
to turn out after this session. Ma was married at fifteen~ and&#xD;
I'm going on seventeen."&#xD;
~'I am quite seventeen, but I am not tired of books. When&#xD;
I leave school, I shall adopt a regular plan of study and*&#xD;
reading."&#xD;
"~Good gracious! Why, don't you expect to get married?&#xD;
What are you going to learn so much for? I reckon you're&#xD;
going to teach school."&#xD;
"No; I study because I like to do it."&#xD;
"Pshaw! you talk like your teacher was in the room. I&#xD;
don't believe that."&#xD;
"The school-bell !" interrupted Ida, happy to. be released.&#xD;
Miss Pratt hung back. "I don't want to go where all them&#xD;
girls are. Will Mr. What's-his-name be mad if I stay here ?"&#xD;

"What and who is she 7" inquired Carr       school was&#xD;
out.&#xD;
"A silly, neglected child," responded her friend. " Shame~&#xD;
fully ignorant, ~when we consider her father's station. lie is a.&#xD;
member of the legislature."&#xD;
can it be the delegate from A-~..-.-? I have heard of&#xD;
him. lie is a clever politician, and an educated man. I am&#xD;
astonished I"&#xD;
So were all who made the acquaintance of his daughter. Mr.&#xD;
Pratt had done his best to serve his country and increase his&#xD;
fortune. The rearing of his children was confided to a weak and&#xD;
foolishly fond mother. The only girl was alternately stuffed and&#xD;
dosed, until the modicum bf intellectual strength nature might&#xD;
have granted her, was nearly destroyed; the arable soil exhausted&#xD;
by the rank weed growth. It was just after his election to the&#xD;
House of Representatives, that the father made. simultaneously&#xD;
two astounding discoveries-~that physically, his daughter was&#xD;
no longer a child, and tha.t she was a dunce, lie had paid a&#xD;
teacher to superintend ber education, and supposed she had done&#xD;
her duty; wherea, the prudent governess, having little more&#xD;
sense than her pupil, and loving her ease fully as well, had en-&#xD;
joyed her sinecure of a situation with no compunctious visiting&#xD;
of. conscience. She acted "according to Mrs. Pratt's instruc-&#xD;
tions." It' was a thunderbolt to the feminine trio when~ the.&#xD;
"Representative introduced a bill of amendment, paid the soi-&#xD;
disant instructress for the work she had not performed, inform-&#xD;
ing her that her services were at an end ; and ordered the mother&#xD;
to resign her spoiled child to him, "he would see what could be&#xD;
done towards redeeming the time." lie carried his point in the&#xD;
teeth of a windy and watery tempest, and "Miss Celestia Pratt"&#xD;
was duly entered on the roll-book of Mr. Purcell's justly cele-&#xD;
brated institution. She soon ceased to complain that she was not&#xD;
noticed. The second day of her attendance she fell in with&#xD;
Ellen. Morris and her coterie. By the time the half hour's recess&#xD;
was over, they were enlightened as to her past life, and future&#xD;
aspirations, and supplied with the material of a year's fun-making;&#xD;
while she was reinstated in her self-consequence, and ready to&#xD;
strike hands with them in any scheme they chalked out.&#xD;

"It is a shame," said Ida, who, with Carry kept aloof,&#xD;
silent speGtators. "Cannot she see what they are doing 7"&#xD;
"It will be a severe, but perhaps a salutary lesson," replied&#xD;
Carry.&#xD;
"But the poor creature will be the butt of the school."&#xD;
"And of the community," said Carry. "I have reasoned&#xD;
with Ellen ;-she is not evil disposed, but would compass sea&#xD;
and land for as rich a. joke as this promises to be. My influence&#xD;
can effect nothing."&#xD;
"What if I warn the girl?" said Ida. "Must. she pay the&#xD;
penalty of her parent's fault 7"&#xD;
"My darling," returned Carry, affectionately, "I am learning&#xD;
prudence from you, and I verily believe I have imparted to you&#xD;
some of my inconsiderateness. What hold have you on this Miss&#xD;
Pratt's confidence? Ellen and her clique are as likely to be in&#xD;
the right as yourself. In her estimation they are more entitled&#xD;
to credence. They play upon the string of self-you will utter&#xD;
a di~ta~teful truth. Let her and. them alone, except so far a.~&#xD;
your individual self is concerned. Attract each one to you, and&#xD;
~you may be the means of bringing them together."&#xD;
Ellen Morris burst into the scf~ool-room one morning in a&#xD;
gale of excitement.&#xD;
It was early, and none of the teachers were present, the girls&#xD;
were gathered in knots about the stove and desks.&#xD;
"Oh girls I" she cried, "I hurried tZ get h~re before my angel&#xD;

"'Well,-let me see,-.--.you must lxi very sober and wise;&#xD;

Then is the time to show off. Literary people never inquire&#xD;

"!Yes,~ she struck in, with a grin. 'So when he asks m6 if&#xD;

"'Don't yeu? Then I will write off a short list. Keep the&#xD;

you steal a sly peep at it.' Oh! it was enrapturing to see how&#xD;
she held on to 'that slip of paper! poring over it every fives&#xD;
minutes before Mr. Dermott~s arrival, and once in two minutes&#xD;
afterwards. She would study it for a second, then her lips would&#xD;
move, until the time for another peep; she was getting it by&#xD;
heart, staring at him all the ~vhile. By and by he happened to&#xD;
be near her; and said something about the Panorama. She had&#xD;
been on tiptoe for the lest hour, lest her trouble should be thrown&#xD;
away; and resolved not to lose this opportunity, she spoke out&#xD;
as loudly as addressing a deaf person-&#xD;
"'Mr. Dermarek! have you ever read Plutarch-es ]Iaiv-es,&#xD;

more were grave; and an indignant voice said, "How wickedly&#xD;
heartless I"&#xD;
There was no mistaking the meaning and emphasis of the&#xD;
interjection. Ellen crimsoned to the roots of her hair. Sh&amp;amp;&#xD;
retorted with a spirit entirely opposite to her usual sportive&#xD;
gaiety.&#xD;
"One, whose lowest thoughts soar so far above the common&#xD;
herd, as Miss Ross, cannot be expected to understand a piece of&#xD;
harmless pleasantry."&#xD;
Ida had unluckily employed the oft-quoted words, "the ~om~&#xD;
mon herd of mankind," in a written composition; and this was&#xD;
not the first time it had been used as an offensive missile.&#xD;
"One must stoop low indeed, Miss Morris," was the instant&#xD;
rejoinder, "to see harmless pleasantry in a plot for the disgrace&#xD;
of an unoffending school-mate."&#xD;
"Ida! Ellen I" exclaimed Carry, laying her hand upon Ellen's&#xD;
mouth, and stifling her reply. "For my sake, girls-if not for&#xD;
your own-say no more! Ida I what have you to do with this&#xD;
miserable affair ?"&#xD;
* . "I have done I" said Ida, bitterly; "Defence of right and&#xD;
truth is better left unatternpt*3d here I"&#xD;
The girls fell back as she crossed io her seat. The sentence&#xD;
sunk into every mind; and the expression of each one showed&#xD;
that she appropriated it. Carry's head dropped upon ]~1llen's&#xD;
shoulder; and sullenly vindictive as was the latter, she was not&#xD;
unmoved by the quiver of the slender frame. Mr. Purcell's&#xD;
entrance put an end to the scene. That was a wretched day to&#xD;
more than one heart. 11a's .was well.nigh~bLir5ting. It mattered&#xD;
n t that her prospects of popularity were, for the present, ship-&#xD;
recked; that her resolutions ~f patience and gentleness had&#xD;
roken, like dry straws, at the breeze of passion ;-Carry was&#xD;
ounded-pei~haPs offcnded~perhaP5 estranged! ~'Still,'%what&#xD;
ave I done ?" whispered pride, ".spoken truth, and defended&#xD;
t e absent!" But conscience answered-" Anger, not justice&#xD;
as the prompter," and again, every feeling merged in one-&#xD;
What will Carry thi~J~ ?" She did not offer her book as usual&#xD;
id not meet her eye. She would have read no resentment -&#xD;
here; the pale, sad face told of suffering, with no admixture of&#xD;
baser motives. The intermission was dull. Miss Celestia'&#xD;

&#xD;
extravagant description of "the party," and "the gentleinen"~&#xD;
she "was introduced to," hardly excited a smile.' A nameless&#xD;
depression was npon all. Ellen, their ringleader in mischief,&#xD;
and Carry, the willing participant in their innocent' pleasures,&#xD;
Were wanting from their band. They remained at their desks,&#xD;
seemingly engaged in study, until almost school-time, when&#xD;
Carry went around to the other, whispered a word; and they&#xD;
left the apartment together. They returned arm in arm, as Ida,&#xD;
who had gone home in recess, more to be quieted and refreshed&#xD;
by the cool air, than for luncheon,-.....entered from the street.&#xD;
She remarked their affectionate air, and happier faces with&#xD;
goading envy. "Ellen is worth conciliating. It would 'be&#xD;
dangerous to break with her. There can be no hesitancy, 'with&#xD;
the fair words of the crowd in one scale-and Ida Ross, unknown&#xD;
and unbeloved, in the other. Be it so !" But awakened affec-&#xD;
tion had had a taste of its proper nutrient, and was not to be&#xD;
famished into silence. The afternoon wore heavily away in the&#xD;
unspoken anguish of love and pride and suspicion. Careless of&#xD;
remarks or conjectures, she declined dinner, and retired at once&#xD;
to her chamber, when she reached home. It might haye been&#xD;
one hour ;~-it might have been three, that she had knelt or laid&#xD;
upon the floor, her head upon a stool, before the mourner for&#xD;
the dead bird ;-weeping and thinking, and seeming to grow a&#xD;
year older with each flood of grief; when there came a tap at the&#xD;
door. "Josephine I" was the first thought-..-to spring to the&#xD;
mirror, brush the tumbled hair, and dash rosewater over the&#xD;
discolored ~heeks, the work of the next minute; then she said&#xD;
'sleepily~" Who is tl~re ?"&#xD;
"It is I----Oarry I"&#xD;
The bolt was withdrawn, and the intruder lay, sobbing upon&#xD;
her breast.&#xD;
'Oh, Ida! how could you' be angry with me ?"&#xD;
Ida struggled with the answering drops, but they would come.&#xD;
'IL thought you had thrown me off; Carry!"~&#xD;
"You cotild not-.-after my note."&#xD;
"Your note !"&#xD;
"I slipped it into your French Grammar, as it lay open before&#xD;
your eye~; and you 'shut the iook and put it aside&#xD;
to read it at your leisure."                ~ I siwPosed&#xD;

"I did not see it."&#xD;
She went to her satchel, and brought forth the Grammar.&#xD;
"There it is I" said Carry, as a folded paper fell from #thin it.&#xD;
"IDo not read it. I will tell you its contents. I asked your&#xD;
forgiveness for interrupting you so rudely this morning; but&#xD;
these public disputes lead to so much evil. Ellen was wrong;&#xD;
~he has said so to me; and is ready to be your friend, if! you&#xD;
consent. Her conduct was blameably thoughtless; and her&#xD;
quick temper could not submit to a rebuke so openly administered.&#xD;
I was abrupt, but it was not because I wars angry with, or did&#xD;
not love you. Ellen's taunt was 'extremely provoking"-&#xD;
"Stop I stop I Carry! It is , who should sue for pardon,&#xD;
and excuse, if I can, my unbeco ing~ heat, and after doubts of&#xD;
your friendship. I cannot tell ou what a fearful warfare has&#xD;
waged within i~ie ;-.--how much i censed I was to see you and&#xD;

"Can you love me after hearing his, Carry ?"&#xD;
"Always-always I',&#xD;
Ellen was amazed, that after oon,' on being summoned to&#xD;
receive visitors, to find in them her two class-mates, and more&#xD;
astounded to hear from 'her anta onist of the morning, a frank&#xD;
and graceful apology for her has y strictures upon .her conduct&#xD;
and words. Ellen was, as she hrased it, "great upon high-&#xD;
'flown speeches; but this was a extraordinary occasion, and&#xD;
demanded a deviation from ordin ry rules; so I condescended, for&#xD;
once, to make' use of simple lang age."&#xD;
"If simple, it was satisfactory, nd they parted most* amicably.&#xD;
It was past sunset, when the frie ds arrived at Mr. Read's door.&#xD;

into the dusk. Others would ha e seen only a pretty girl, with&#xD;
a smile like May sunshine ;~-to he fond eyes that followed her,&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
SPUING had departed,, and the good citizens of Richmond&#xD;
complained as piteously of the heat, as though every zephyr&#xD;
that awoke for miles around, did not sweep over their seven&#xD;
hills freighted with the perfume of gardens and groves, instead&#xD;
of the reeking odors of a thronged city. 4nd in our day, as&#xD;
then, airy, spacious villas are forsaken, while their infatuated&#xD;
'denizens hie away to ray. $~O per week, for a genteel sty, six&#xD;
feet by ten; with the privilege of eating such fare, as in the&#xD;
event of its appearance upon their own boards, would find its&#xD;
way back to the place where 'it was concocted, accompanied by&#xD;
an anathematised warning to the cook ;-and of gulping down&#xD;
unwholesomely..copious draughts of a nauseous liquid, which the&#xD;
stomach neither relishes, nor needs. There is dancing "all&#xD;
night, 'till broad day-light," a dusty drive to assist the diges-&#xD;
tion of a breakfast, one's common sense, no less than the&#xD;
digerent organs assures him 'is insured against chylifaction;&#xD;
promenading until dinner, which meal is taken in full dress ;-.&#xD;
another drive; or an enervating siesta, and it is time to dress for&#xD;
supper; then dancing again; and at the end of "the season,"&#xD;
the fashionable votaries return, jaded and debilitated, to home&#xD;
and comfort, and tell you, with a ghastly smile, that they have&#xD;
been ruralizing at the "Carburretted, Sulphuretted, Chalybeate&#xD;
Springs." Ruralis~ng at the 'Springs! sketching a landscape&#xD;
from an Express tr~in~sleeping in a canal-boat~reciprocating&#xD;
ideas with a talkative woman!&#xD;
Mr. Read came 'hori~e 'to tea, on a sultry July evening, with'&#xD;
some crotchet in* his brain.' That could be seen with half an&#xD;
eye; and Josephine was affable to a distressing degree, to coax&#xD;
the stranger into an earlier incubation, than would occur without&#xD;
artificial wai~mth. The effects of her Eccolodeon were' presently&#xD;
apparent.&#xD;
"When does your ~session close, Josey ?" he inquired.&#xD;
'On Friday, sir."&#xD;

ALONE.                         67.&#xD;
"Then you will be on your head to quit town, like everybody&#xD;
else."&#xD;
"I have no solicitude on the subject, sir. I am as indifferent&#xD;
to it, a~ to many other things people rave about."&#xD;
~cYou are your father's child, cool and hard I" observed her&#xD;
parent, with a gratified look.&#xD;
"But for a novelty, what say you to a trip to Saratoga 7"&#xD;
"I should like it, sir,-:f you accompany me."&#xD;
"I have business which takes me in that direction, and I&#xD;
thought, as you are to 'come out' next winter, it would sound&#xD;
well to have made your d6but at sucl~ a fashionable 'place."&#xD;
Josephine smiled; she could appreciate this argument. The&#xD;
journey was discussed-the expenses, dress, appearance, etc.&#xD;
Ida sat by, taciturn and unconsulted. She had a motive in&#xD;
remaining. Finally, she contrived to throw in a word.&#xD;
"I wish to inform you of my arrangements for the summer,&#xD;
sir, if you have time to listen."&#xD;
"Yours I. they are the same as ours, of course. Do you&#xD;
imagine that I would permit my daughter to travel without a&#xD;
female companion, or give her an advantage, you are not to&#xD;
share 1"&#xD;
The latter clause was so clearly an afterthought, and dove.&#xD;
tailed so oddly with its, antecedent, that Ida's smile was almost&#xD;
a sneer.&#xD;
." I am sorry, sir, that you are disappointed in your calcula.&#xD;
tions; bgt as Josephine has a maid, I do not deem my attendance&#xD;
indispensable. If I leave town, I shall go in another direction,&#xD;
~nless you positively forbid it."&#xD;
"And what place is to be honored by your preference? May&#xD;
I presume to ask ?"&#xD;
"I shall go home with Miss Carleton."&#xD;
"Ahem I I comprehend. I should have anticipated this from&#xD;
your overpowering intimacy. You have played your cards badly,&#xD;
Josephine. Why have you not ingratiated yourself with some&#xD;
'divine creature,' who has a rich papa? It is 'a capital means&#xD;
of extending one's acquaintance, and sparing one's puyse.' How&#xD;
long do you intend to sponge-to remains I meanwith your&#xD;
friend, Miss Ross ?"&#xD;
"I may not return before Christmas. I hear that the boll.&#xD;

days are celebrated with much style and festivity; i&#xD;
country," she replied.&#xD;
Mr. Read suppressed something very like an oath, at her&#xD;
calm assurance.&#xD;
"When do you 'go ?"&#xD;
"Next Monday. Dr. Carleton is expected daily. Did I u~ider&#xD;
stand you to say, that you did not object ?"&#xD;
"Confound it! 'what do I care where, or when you go ?" ~&#xD;
"Oh Carry I" apostrophized Ida, shutting herself in her r~om.&#xD;
"Even you could not be charitable and forbearing here. ~it is&#xD;
hard ! hard !'&#xD;
"That is unquestionably, the most wrong-headed girl I know,"&#xD;
8aid Mr. Read, to his daughter.&#xD;
"I am heartily glad she is not g&amp;amp;ing with us," was the answer&#xD;
"She, would be of no use* to me, and an additional care to you.&#xD;
"Maybe so, maybe not. Her travelling expenses ~would not&#xD;
have come out of my pocket; and there are advantages, some-&#xD;
times, in having two ladies, a larger and better room, and such&#xD;
like; you pay the same price, and have twice the value of your&#xD;
money. You understand ?"&#xD;
"I don't care. I had rather sleep upon a pallet in a loft, by&#xD;
myself than in the handsomest room in the house, with her for&#xD;
a room-mate. It frets me, though to see her airs! I wish the*&#xD;
law allowed you absolute control."&#xD;
." It wont do with her. If she suspected a design on my part.&#xD;
to abridge her liberties, or defraud her of her dues, ~he would as&#xD;
lief enter a complaint against me ~s not. She has the temper&#xD;
of the Evil One; aiid watch as you may, will get the bit between&#xD;
her 'teeth."&#xD;
The carriage was at the door by s~x o'clock on Monday morn-&#xD;
ing. Ida was ready; but her trunk~ was strapped on, and her&#xD;
maid seated upon the box with the driver, before she appeared.&#xD;
The truth was, she dreaded to meet I~r. Carleton. She did not&#xD;
recollect her own father, and ad no agreeable associations&#xD;
connected with ~any, who bore that relation to her young&#xD;
acquaintances. She was inclined to look 'upon the class, as a&#xD;
set of necessary discords in life; Mr. Read being the key-note.'&#xD;
Carry often SpQke of her surviving parent with earnest affection;&#xD;
but Ida attributed this to a charity, that beheld no faults in&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                        69&#xD;
those she loved. The thought of her ride and 'visit would have&#xD;
been unalloyed, but for this idiosyncrasy. "If he were like&#xD;
Mr. Dana 1" she said, going slowly down stairs. 'He was in th~&#xD;
porch, with Mr. Read and Carry. "My friend Ida, father,"&#xD;
said Carry., He was not like Mr. Dana,-better than that! He&#xD;
was the image of Carry-her eyes, mouth and smile-his locks,&#xD;
although silvered by years, must in youth have waved in the&#xD;
same golden curls. He was handsome yet, how could he be&#xD;
otherwise! and had she failed to love him ~tt sight, the unaf-&#xD;
fected geniality of his salutation would have captivated her.&#xD;
She had not a' care in the world, as she reclined in the carriage,&#xD;
beside Carry, the revolving wheels bearing her towards the&#xD;
country. Mr. Read 'and his feminine prototype were sign-posts,&#xD;
marking rough and miry roads she had travelled; they were&#xD;
troubles no more; she was leaving them behind.&#xD;
There had been a thunder-storm in the night, and in that&#xD;
brief fit of passion, nature had wept away every unkind or un~&#xD;
pleasant emotion. The sky wore that rich, soft, transparent hue,&#xD;
which imparts its own pureness to the soul of him, who lo~ks upon&#xD;
it; smilingly luring it to soar away, and "steep itself in ~he blue&#xD;
of its remembered homes" the forest-leaves glittered with rain-&#xD;
diamonds, and th6 bird..matin was warbled by a full orchestra.&#xD;
'And on, through the slants of sunlight, and the alternations of&#xD;
deep, green shade; with the old, familiar chirping in her ear,&#xD;
and the touch of the loved one's hand upon hers, rode the&#xD;
orphan; very quiet, through excess of happiness; afraid to&#xD;
speak or move, lest this should prove a never-to-be realized&#xD;
dream, whose awaking should bring bitter, hopeless yearnings !.&#xD;
Little by little, Carry..broke up her musings; and her father&#xD;
seconded her. He was prepared to like his daughter's friend,&#xD;
and there was that in his eye and voice, which made Ida forget,&#xD;
as she had -done with Carry,.-4hat she was talking with a&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
"That is a fine specimen of your.favorite tree, Ida," observed&#xD;
Carry, pointing to a majestic pine, grand' and solitary, at the&#xD;
entrance of a grove of oaks.&#xD;
"And superb it is, in its loneliness 1" said Ida.&#xD;
"Farmers would cavil at your taste," remarked Dr. Carleton.&#xD;
"'Pine barrens' are proverbial. A thick growth of them is, an&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7999-00000036"/>&#xD;
70&#xD;
&#xD;
A LOQNE&#xD;
&#xD;
tinmist~keable sign of poverty of soil. Nothing else can extract'&#xD;
sustenance from t~ie worn out ground."&#xD;
"That is. why Ii ike them, sir. There is sublimity in their&#xD;
hardy independence, taking root, as you say, where pampered, or&#xD;
less robtist vegetation would perish, and with never.furling&#xD;
banners, stretching up boldly towards the stars."&#xD;
"They are emblems to you-of what'?" asked the Doctor.&#xD;
"Of the few really great ones, who have demonstrated that&#xD;
human nature is not of necessity, vile or imbecile, or' yet a&#xD;
debtor to 'accident, for it~ spice of good."&#xD;
"The gifted,-or the fortunate ?"&#xD;
"The resolute,-sir. They, who have riven ,the* shackles of&#xD;
low birth or poverty~ and made for themselves a glorious name&#xD;
-out of nothTng !-have done it by the naked force of will.&#xD;
Call it 'talent' or 'genius,' if you ~hoose ;---- upon analyzation,&#xD;
you will resolve it into this one 'element of character."&#xD;
"It' is a sorry task to pick flaws in your beautiful analogy,"&#xD;
said the old gentleman. "You may not' be aware that your&#xD;
pine, sturdy as it appears, is less fitted than any other tree, for&#xD;
standing alone; its roots running out laterally from the trunk;&#xD;
and lying near the surface of 'the earth. Cut down the outer&#xD;
row which have kept off the tempests, and helped to support&#xD;
him, and the first hard *ind 'is apt to lay him low."&#xD;
"And so there are fates, against which the mightiest of&#xD;
mortal energies are powerless. Leave the pine unprotected, and&#xD;
if it suiwive one blast, it strikes its roots ~deeper and deeper into&#xD;
the ground, until it has strength to brave an' hundred winters.&#xD;
Adversity, if it does not kill--.strengthens."&#xD;
"iDo you favor the philosophy, which teaches that a certain&#xD;
amount of trouble in necessary for the complete development&#xD;
of character ?"&#xD;
"Whether necessary or not-it comes. That is not a matter&#xD;
of' hypothesis; but I have seen some, who, I did not think,&#xD;
required discipline; and many more, ~who wanted softening,&#xD;
instead of hardening."&#xD;
"Is hardening the legitimate effect of sorrow ?" asked he, more&#xD;
gravely. "When the chastening is guided by love, does it not&#xD;
melt and refine? Are strength and hardness synonymous ?"&#xD;
"I question the difference, sir,-as the world goes."&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                  -       IA&#xD;
"Instead of referring to 'the world,' in an abstract sense-&#xD;
judge we of the influence of trials, by what xwe know of qur&#xD;
selves. I never tasted real happiness, until I learned to bear&#xD;
grief, by submitting to the will of Providence."&#xD;
"And one affliction has embittered life for me 1" returned Ida,&#xD;
gloomily.&#xD;
"Poor child I" then recolleot~ng'himself, h~ addressed Carry in&#xD;
a jesting tone. "A~d you-Miss Carry-what is your. vote&#xD;
upon this important q~iestion?"&#xD;
"I have had no trouble, sir," replied she, lightly, "except&#xD;
school-quarrels. *You would not class them in the category of&#xD;
tribulations."&#xD;
There was sadness in her father's look of love, as heanswered,&#xD;
"I hope you may long be~able to say so, dear 1"&#xD;
Carry brushed away the mist from her lashes. "'.A consum-&#xD;
mation devotedly to be desired,'-as Charley, or Shakspeare&#xD;
would say. Where is he, father ?"&#xD;
"Who? Shakspeare or Charley ?"&#xD;
"The latter, of course.' Apart from his probable location&#xD;
being more easily decided upon,-he is, to me, the more interest-&#xD;
ing of th~ tWQ.'&#xD;
"He is somewhere in the Western part of the State ;~-~&#xD;
travelling, partly for pleasure. John told you, that they have corn-,&#xD;
mitted the New York branch of the business to Mr. E&#xD;
and that Charley will in future reside in Richmond."&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I was glad to hear it; I understood, however, that&#xD;
this change would not be made before Fall. In the interim, are&#xD;
not we to be favoured with his company ?"&#xD;
"I trust so. It will seem like old~ times for us all to be&#xD;
together again."&#xD;
"I hope he will come while you are with us, Ida," said Carry.&#xD;
"I am so anxiot~s you should know him 1"&#xD;
"You have seen him, surely, Miss Ida ?" said Dr. Carleton.&#xD;
"I have not yet had that pleasure, sir."&#xD;
* "He is an original worth studying."&#xD;
"I can credit that. Elle's panegyrics would have created' a&#xD;
desire to see his nonpareil of an 'Uncle Charley,' and Carry has&#xD;
raised my curiosity~to the highest pitch, by naming. him as the&#xD;
successful rival of 'Shakspeare."&#xD;
&#xD;

* 72                      ALONE.&#xD;
"Oh I" cried Carry, laughing. "I said more interesting to&#xD;
me. Charley is one of my pets; and I am afraid I have&#xD;
presented you with an eh~bneously flattered picture of him. You&#xD;
must' not look for an 'Admirable Crichton.' he is not one to&#xD;
please the fancy ofl a slight acquaintance."&#xD;
"Is he as handsome as his brother ?"&#xD;
"Which brother? inquired the Doctor; and Carry blushed.&#xD;
"I have met but one," said Ida. "I consider Mr. John&#xD;
Dana very fine-looking.~~&#xD;
"I will repeat Charley's ideas of what he styles, his "personal&#xD;
pulchritude,"' responded Carry. "He says he thanks Heaven&#xD;
he is not handsome. To endow him with a moderate share of&#xD;
beauty, s6me one would have been deprived of his, or her good&#xD;
looks. No broken hearts are laid at the door of his conscience."&#xD;
'Yes'-~concluded he, triumphantly-' A man ought to be grate~&#xD;
ful for ugliness; and I am persuaded that not many have as much&#xD;
cause to rejoice on that score as myself!"'&#xD;
He is not homely," said her father, warmly..&#xD;
"Ah father I other people tell a different story."&#xD;
"That may b~; but where you find one handsomer face than&#xD;
his, you see a thousand destitute of its intelligence and agreeable-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"Granted. Homely or not, I prefer him to any doll-faced&#xD;
dandy of my acquaintance.".&#xD;
"He is fortunate in his advocates," said Ida. "He has the&#xD;
* art of making friends."&#xD;
"Because he is such a firm friend himself," replied Carry.&#xD;
"Yet some will have it that he is frivolous and unfeeling. . The&#xD;
* only satirical remark I was ever guily of, was extorted by an asper-&#xD;
sion of this kind. A lady was offended by a playful bagatelle&#xD;
of his; and thinking that I would be a sure medium of com-&#xD;
municating her wrath to its object, criticized him unsparingly.&#xD;
She ridiculed his person and manners ;.-..-I said nothing. She&#xD;
said he was bankrupt in chivalry and politeness... I smiled; and&#xD;
* ~he blazed out a philippic against his. 'disgusting levity and&#xD;
* non&amp;amp;ense.-~-he had not a spark of feeling, or grain of sense~&#xD;
intelligent indeed! for her part she had never heard him' say ~&#xD;
smart or sensible thing yet.'-.I put in my oar here-' You will ~&#xD;
then allow, him one talent, at least; the ability to adapt hi~&#xD;

I:&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                        73&#xD;
conversation to the company he is in.' I repented having said&#xD;
it; but it quieted her."&#xD;
*        "You did not reproach yourself for taking the part of your&#xD;
friend 1"&#xD;
*         "No, out I might have done it in a less objectionable manner.&#xD;
It did not alter her feelings to him, and caused her to dislike&#xD;
me"&#xD;
"How is it, sir, that I hear so much more of this one of your&#xD;
former wards, than of his younger brother ?" said Ida to the&#xD;
Doctor. an instant,&#xD;
The question was innocently propounded, for&#xD;
she was puzzled by the quizzical demureness, with which he&#xD;
glanced at his daughter.&#xD;
*        "This is a serious charge, Carry. Your predilection for one&#xD;
old play-fellow should not make yo~ forgetful of another."&#xD;
She was looking down, touching the shining tire of the wheel&#xD;
*      with the tip of her gloved finger. The truth beamed upon Ida;&#xD;
and, with it a thousand little circumstances she had been blindly&#xD;
stupid not to understand before. 11cr intelligent eye said the&#xD;
mystery was explained, but she forbore to say so in words., Dr.&#xD;
Carleton went on in a changed tone.&#xD;
"Arthur is not a whit behind his brothers in sterling worth,&#xD;
or personal graces. 11~ is associated with me in the practice of&#xD;
medicine, and unites a skill and prudence, rarely found in one so&#xD;
young. He is popular, and deservedly so."&#xD;
in Carry bestowed a gr~tefAl smile upon him, and was answered&#xD;
same mute lang~iage. In su~ch desultory chat, the sunny&#xD;
hours ran out. They travelled well; only stopping an hour to&#xD;
dine and rest; yet twilight saw them eight mfles from their des-&#xD;
tination. Each was disposed to silence~ as the. light grew dim-&#xD;
mer; and when the moon smiled at them above iI iree-tops,&#xD;
she elicited but a single observation of her beauty. The road&#xD;
was lonely and sheltered; bordered by forests on one side, and&#xD;
thicket-grown banks on the other; the soil sandy and heavy;&#xD;
the tramp of hoofs scarcelyy heard, and the wheels rolling with a&#xD;
low, crushing sound, that, to Ida, was not unmusical. Silver&#xD;
willows, and ~twisting 'bamboo' vines, and the long-leaved&#xD;
Typha Latifolia edged the road; and she watched through the&#xD;
openings in the woven screen, for a glimpse of the stream that&#xD;

watered their roots; sometimes deceived by the shimmer of the&#xD;
moon upon the ~eaves; sometimes, by the white sands, until she&#xD;
doubted whether~ there was indeed one there ;--when the gurgling&#xD;
of falling watei~s betrayed the modest brooklet, and it widened&#xD;
into a pretty pool; the moon's silver shield upon its bosom.&#xD;
The thicket became taller, and not so dense; tulip trees and oaks&#xD;
in place of the aquatic undergrowth; and between, them the&#xD;
fleeting glimmering of the sky were, to her, an army of pale&#xD;
spectres, marching noiselessly past; no halting or wavering; on,&#xD;
on, in unbrok e~i cavalcade, "down to the dead." And memory,&#xD;
at fancy's call, produced the long roll of those who had gone to&#xD;
the world of shades ;-tlie master-spirits of all ages ;-the&#xD;
oppressed and the oppressor ;--the lovely and the loved ;-had&#xD;
joined that phantom procession ;-how few leaving even the&#xD;
legacy of a name to earth! With the Persian Poether heart&#xD;
cried out-" Where are they ?" and echo answered-" Where&#xD;
are they ?" And thought poured on thought, under the i~eird&#xD;
influence of that enchanted night, until the shadowy host was the&#xD;
one reality in the landscape; and one and another beckoned and&#xD;
waved to her, as they defiled by. She came near shrieking-.-so&#xD;
startled was she--~-as a horseman reined up at the window. The&#xD;
moon was at his, back; but showed every lineament of her coun-&#xD;
tenance. He raised his hat. "Miss Ross, I believe. I fear my&#xD;
sudden appearance has alarmed you."&#xD;
." Arthur! my boy! how are you ?" exclaimed Dr. Carleton,&#xD;
*     extending his hand, which was as eagerly seized. "Miss Ross--&#xD;
Dr. Dana.&#xD;
"Miss Ross will excuse me for having anticipated the intro-&#xD;
duction,", said he, bowing again, and rode to the opposite side of&#xD;
the carriage. The greetings there were more quiet; but it&#xD;
needed not Ida's delicate ear to detect the feelingg in the voices&#xD;
which tried to say common-place things. Arthur had much to.&#xD;
say to the doctor, and once in a while a remark for her--Carr&#xD;
remaining in the back-ground. y&#xD;
"Were you uneasy that we did~ not arrive ?" asked Dr.&#xD;
Carleton.&#xD;
"Not uneasy--but restless; and ~o relieve my impatience&#xD;
i~ode out to meet you."&#xD;
lie was first op this side.--now op that--as the highway&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;

&#xD;
afforded him room; but Ida could not get a view of his face&#xD;
His figure was good, and he sat his horse well ;~h~~upon these&#xD;
facts, and such impressions as were made by a pleasant voice and&#xD;
gentlemanly address, she was obliged to form her opinion of his&#xD;
personal appearance, until more light should be shed upon the&#xD;
subject. The house appeared, approached by a shady lane, and&#xD;
so empowered in trees, that only the chimneys were visible from&#xD;
the main road. Carry's tongue was unloosed as she bounded&#xD;
into the midst of the sable throng that swarmed about the car-&#xD;
riage. Arthur exclaimed merrily at the clamor of blessings and&#xD;
inquiries.&#xD;
"Will you accept me as your attendant, Miss Ross? The&#xD;
ceremony of reception will last some time"&#xD;
But Carry was in the piazza as soon as they were.&#xD;
"Thank "you, Arthur, for taking charge of her. Welcome to&#xD;
Poplar-grove, dear Ida! May you be as happy here as I have&#xD;
been!"&#xD;
"Amen I" said Dr. Carleton and Arthur, heartily.&#xD;
Carry acted like a wild creature all the evening. She half-&#xD;
carried Ida to her chamber, and kissed her over and over.&#xD;
"Now, darling I" she ran on, strewing their shawls and bon-&#xD;
nets in all directions. "You see I have no idea of putting you&#xD;
company style, in another room. You will be with me morn-&#xD;
ing, noon, and night. My dear, dear room! how natural it looks I&#xD;
and to think I am never to kave it again I"&#xD;
"Bless your heart!" said a middle-aged mulatto woman, whose&#xD;
mild and pleasing face struck Ida as much as her motherly kind-&#xD;
ness to her young mistress, "You are not half so glad to get back&#xD;
as we are to have you here.&#xD;
"Hush, Mammy! you will make me cry. Comb my hair-&#xD;
will you? Not that I do not believe you could do it, Sally; but&#xD;
it used to be Mammy's. work."'&#xD;
4          "Thoughtful of others still," reflected Ida, as the girl Sally&#xD;
displayed a double row of ivories, at Carry's apology. "Can&#xD;
nothing make her selfish ?"&#xD;
"We won't waste time by an elaborate toilet, dear," said&#xD;
Carry, seeing Ida deliberating tipon two dresses. "Father will&#xD;
be too much engaged with his supper to notice our dress. Wear&#xD;
the plain white one; it is very becoming; and remember, you&#xD;
are in the back-woods."&#xD;

Arthnr was in the parlor when they descended. He looked&#xD;
as happy as Carry, and "almost as good," thought Ida. She&#xD;
was not de trop; it might have been a brother and sister who&#xD;
strove to convince her that this, their home, was hers fo~ the&#xD;
time-being. The supper-table was set with taste and profusion.&#xD;
Ida wondered whether the menage were entirely controlled by&#xD;
coloured servants. She learned afterwards that "Mammy,"&#xD;
trained by Mrs. Carleton, and until that lady's death, her con-&#xD;
stant~ attendant, was housekeeper.&#xD;
"You have not much affection for a city life, Miss Ida," said&#xD;
Arthur, continuing a conversation commenced in .the parlor.&#xD;
"No. I am country-bred, and h~h&#xD;
ceri~ a preference for the&#xD;
scenes of my childhood. Perhaps," she s~iid, ingeniously, "the&#xD;
fault is in myself. I did not want to live in Richmond, and&#xD;
determined not. to like it."&#xD;
"And are'your aversions so strong that the manifold attrac-&#xD;
tions of the metropolis cannot shake them? or~ are you countrified&#xD;
upon. principle ?"&#xD;
"I have not given the city a fair trial. It has occurred to&#xD;
md lately that my weariness of it proceeded from monotony&#xD;
rather than satiety. There is little variety in school life."&#xD;
"Except when we regard i~ as the world in miniature," said&#xD;
Arthur.. "It is different, doubtless, in 'Young Lady Establish-&#xD;
~nents,' but we boys contrived to maintain ,a healthy circulation,&#xD;
one way or another."'&#xD;
"Is.it not a popular fallacy that school-days are the happiest&#xD;
of one's life 7" asked Ida.&#xD;
"Unquestionably," rejoined he, proniply. "As well say that&#xD;
Spring is the farmer's happiest season. He has the pleasures&#xD;
of hope, the ~delight of viewing his whitening harvests into&#xD;
fiituro; but there is severe, unromantic drudgery; suspense and&#xD;
boding fears for the result. ,The 'harvest home' for me!&#xD;
"And when is that I" questioned Ida.&#xD;
"Now I" said he, with emphasis.&#xD;
"What do you mean ?" inquired Carry.&#xD;
"That you and Miss Ida begin to reap from this date. To&#xD;
dispense with this inconvenient metaphor, your actions will be&#xD;
the proof of what your lessons have been; every day your&#xD;
knowledge 'and principles will be brought into play,-you will&#xD;
be binding up sheaves of worthy' or of evil deeds."&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                         Vt&#xD;
"You are trying to terrify us," said Carry. "Don't you wish&#xD;
yourself at school again, Ida ?"&#xD;
"Are you sorry you're a-goin' to turn out ?" replied Ida, in a&#xD;
peculiar tone.&#xD;
"Oh, Celestia I" exclaimed (larry, with a burst of laughter.&#xD;
"Who? what ?" said her father.&#xD;
"One of our school-mates, father; who, hearing another say&#xD;
that she was sorry to quit school, went through the house the&#xD;
day we were dismissed, asking each one confidentially, 'Are ycn~&#xD;
sorry you're a-goin to turn out ?' grief at such an event being,&#xD;
in her code, a more heinous sin than to dance at a funeral."&#xD;
"Who was she 7" asked Arthur.&#xD;
"Miss Pratt-Celestia Pratt."&#xD;
"Daughter of the member from A- ?"&#xD;
"The same-what do you know of her?~'&#xD;
"I met her once at a ball," he replied.&#xD;
"Were you introduced 7" cried both girls in a breath.&#xD;
"Yes; and danced with ber."&#xD;
"Enough ?" said Carry. "We will 'not pursue the subject."&#xD;
"As you please," he returned; "but if I am not mistaken, as&#xD;
Sir Roger says, f4iough with a different meaning, 'much could&#xD;
be said on both sides.'"&#xD;
CHAPTER YIII.&#xD;
POPLAR-GROVE was comparatively a modem place; having&#xD;
been built by the present proprietor at the time of his marriage.&#xD;
The house was of brick, large and commodious; and flanked by&#xD;
neat out-houses and servants' quarters, presenting an imposing&#xD;
appearance, an air of lordly beauty. The shade trees were&#xD;
forest-born; the maple, oak, beech, and fairest of all, the tulip-&#xD;
poplar. Excepting in the green-house, on the souVh side of the&#xD;
mansion, and a rose.creeper that climbed upon the piazza, not a&#xD;
flower was tolerated within the spacious yard, and the sward was&#xD;
always green and smooth. 'Dr. Carleton's seat was the pride~ and&#xD;
envy of the country. "No wonder," growled the croaker; "a&#xD;

lived in barn-like structures, treeless and yardless; (and who that&#xD;
has travelled in our commonwealth, but knows the heart-sicken-&#xD;

the beautiful was exhumed by the sight of the work of taste and&#xD;
industry; and the stupid stare was succeeded by jealous repin-&#xD;
ings, and the writing down of a long score against Providence.&#xD;
"I tell you what, my friend," the doctor said to o~ie of these&#xD;
- inurmurers, "instead of harping so much upon one P, try my&#xD;
three, and my word for it, your wishes will be fulfilled sooner&#xD;
by fifty years-they are, Planting, Perseverance and Paint."&#xD;
In the garden, beauty and utility joined hands, and danced&#xD;
* together down the walks. There were squares of thrifty vegeta-&#xD;
bles, deserving a home in the visioned Eden of an ambitious&#xD;
horticulturist; and the banished floral treasures here expanded&#xD;
in every variety of hue and fragrance. There grew hedges of&#xD;
roses, and the dwarf lilac, and the jessamine family, tl~e star,&#xD;
the Catalonian, the white and yellow, thatching one arbor;&#xD;
while the odorous Florida, the coral, and the more comni on but&#xD;
dearer garden honeysuckle wreathed their lithe tendrils over&#xD;
another;' and ever-blowing wall-flowers, humble and sweet, gaudy&#xD;
beds of carnations, and brightly-smiling coreopsis, and pure lilies&#xD;
with their fragrant hearts powdered with golden dust-a witch-&#xD;
ing wilderness of delights. Trellises, burdened with ripening&#xD;
grapes, were the boundary line between- the* garden. and the&#xD;
orchai~d. The same just s~nse of order and 'welLbeing regulated&#xD;
the whole plantation. Kindness was the main-spring of the&#xD;
machinery, but it was a kindness that knew how to punish as&#xD;
well as reward.&#xD;
"iDo you believe in the unity of the human race ?" asked Ida,&#xD;
one e'~ening, as she and Carry were taki g their twilight prome-&#xD;
nade in the long parlor.&#xD;
"Assuredly; but what put that in o your head just now ?"&#xD;
"I ~was thinking of your father; a d trying to realize that he&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
belongs to the same species with others I could name. I am&#xD;
compelled to the conclusion that he is an appendix, a later crea-&#xD;
tion, a type o~ what man would have been had he not 'sought&#xD;
out many inventions.~~~&#xD;
~' And what new instance of his immaculateness has induced&#xD;
this sapient belief ?"&#xD;
"I was sitting at the window this afternoon, before he went&#xD;
out, when I heard him call to litde Dick to bring his saddle- -&#xD;
bags from 'the office.' The boy, scampered off, and presently&#xD;
appeared running, still holding the precious load with great care&#xD;
-in both hands. 'Steady, my lad,' said your father, and as the&#xD;
warning passed his lips, Dick tripped his foot, and came down-&#xD;
the saddle-bags under him. He cried loudly, and your father&#xD;
ran to pick him up-what do you suppose he said ?"&#xD;
"Inquired if he was hurt, of course."&#xD;
"He did-but reflect! every phial - was smashed, and that 'is&#xD;
no trifle this far from the city, I take it. Yes-he set the little&#xD;
chap upon his feet, and asked after'iihe integrity of' hi~ bones;&#xD;
and when he sobbed, 'I aint hurt, sir-'but de bottle~-dey's&#xD;
all broke!' patted him upon the head, and bade him 'stop crying&#xD;
master isn't angry-you won't run so fast next time," and let&#xD;
him .go. 'Then, kneeling upon the grass, he* unlocked the&#xD;
portable apothecary-shop, and pulled out gallipots and packages,&#xD;
fractured and stained in every imaginable shape and manner-&#xD;
looking seriously perplexed. 'This is an awkward business,'&#xD;
he said, aloud; 'and my stock is so nearly out! but accidents&#xD;
will happen. -&#xD;
"And is that all 7" said Carry.&#xD;
~ 'All!' I have seen men affect forbearance, and talk largely&#xD;
of forgiveness, when they wanted to 'show off "but 'IXe did not&#xD;
know that I was within hearing. Some other principle was at&#xD;

esteemed guardian would have said upon the occasio-n! He&#xD;
punishes a menial more severely for an accident, or thoughtless-&#xD;
ness, than for deliberate villaiiy." -&#xD;
"I do not pretend to uphold Mr. Read's doctrines or practice.&#xD;
I am afraid he is thoroughly selfish, and Josephine is too close&#xD;

- awhile? There is a hard look in your eye, and a scorn in your&#xD;
tone, when you refer to them, that repel me. It is so unlike&#xD;
you I"&#xD;
"So like me, Carry! My character is velvet or fur-stroire it&#xD;
in one direction, and you enhance whatever of beauty or gloss it&#xD;
possesses; reverse the motion, and you encounter rough prickles,&#xD;
and in certain states of the atmosphere, more electricity than is&#xD;

gliding over me now; you may do what you will with me."&#xD;
"But you are happier than you used to be ?"&#xD;
"I am-~happier in you! Do you recollect the stormy&#xD;
November evening when you 'took me in?' Cold, and wet,&#xD;

"Not now. ]3ut will the time never come, when other claims&#xD;
will dispossess me of my place? hi~b not despise me, darling!&#xD;
Do not impute to me the meanness of being envious of your&#xD;
happiness. I rejoice with, and am proud for you-proud of your&#xD;

He spoke to me of his hopes two years ago, but father exacted&#xD;
from us a promise that no love but that of brother and sister&#xD;
should be named between us until my school-days were at an&#xD;
end. Yet I knew that I was not a sister to him; and, to me,&#xD;

"That love is to be my redemption, Carry. In the upper&#xD;
region of the air there is eternal calm and sunshine, while the&#xD;
clouds brood and crash,~below. Such calm and light shall my&#xD;
love win for me. I have dwelt 'for years in the black, noisome&#xD;

'Love may slumber in a young maiden's heart, but he always&#xD;

than any the night bestows. I ~have dreamed that my wayward&#xD;
will bent, in glad humility, to a stronger and wiser mind ;-&#xD;
that my eye fell beneath the fondness of one that quailed at&#xD;
nothing; that I leaned my tired head upon a bosom, whose every&#xD;
throb was to me an earnest of his abiding truth; and drank in&#xD;
the music of a voice, whose sweetest'accent was the low whisper&#xD;
that called me 'his own!' These are not chance vagaries; they&#xD;
have been the food of my heart for long and dreary months;&#xD;
angel-voices about my pillow-my companions in the still twi-&#xD;

console. Then my breast is a temple, consecrated to an ideal,&#xD;

hoarded riches of a lifetime are heaped upon his shrine.. I have&#xD;
imagined him high in the world's opinion; doing his part nobly&#xD;

There was a long stillness. Carry was weeping silently. She&#xD;
was a novice to the world, and believed that many were guileless&#xD;
and loving as herself; but she felt, as she listened to this enthu-&#xD;
siastic outflow from ice-girt depths, unfathomable ~to her, unsus-&#xD;
pected by others, that terrible woe was in reserv~ for the heart&#xD;
so suddenly unveiled. There was, about Ida, i'~ihen her real&#xD;

&#xD;
the tide would have its way, and one must abide its ebb in&#xD;
patb~nce. Her first words showed that it had retired.&#xD;
"I appear strangely fitful to your gentle little self, dear on~&#xD;
It is seldom that I yield to these humours. You have pierced&#xD;
to the bottom of my heart to-night ;" linking her arm again in&#xD;
Carry's. "Forget my vehemence, and believe m&amp;amp; if you will,&#xD;
the iceberg people say I am."&#xD;
~' Never! oh, Ida! Why do yourself such injustice? Why&#xD;
not let your friends know that you have feeling? They would&#xD;

"Do not believe it. I should be sent to the Insane Hospital.&#xD;

"There you go I" exclaimed Carry. "One moment all soft-&#xD;
ness-the next, an ocean is between us. Contradictory enigma!&#xD;
If IL loved you lens, I should be angry. You read ~every leaf of&#xD;
my heart as easily as you unfold a newspaper; and just as I&#xD;
fancy that I have the key to yours, it is shut close--a casket, -&#xD;
whose spring I cannot find."&#xD;
"Or like an oyster," said Ida. "Apropo de bottes-here&#xD;
come the candles, harbingers of supper, and I hear our brace of&#xD;
Esculapii, upon the porch, ready to discuss it."&#xD;
Carry asked herself if it could be the impassioned irnprovisa-&#xD;
trice, who charmed her father and Arthur into forgetfulness of&#xD;
professional anxieties, and the attractions of the inviting board,&#xD;
by her brilliant play of wit, sparkling and pleasant as foam upon&#xD;
champagne, without its evanescence. The gentlemen admired&#xD;
and liked her. That they unconsciously identified her with&#xD;
Carry, may have accounted for this, in part, but most was owing&#xD;
to her powers of pleasing. An inquiry, made with extreme&#xD;
gravity, as to the number and welfare of their patients, was the&#xD;
preface to a burlesque sketch of the saddle-bag scene; in which,&#xD;
not a hint of the reflections it inspired, escaped her; and when&#xD;
she described the doctor's rueful countenance, as he held up the&#xD;
neck and topple of a large phial, saying dolefully, "The Cab-&#xD;
mel too, and three cases of fever on hand!' Arthur resigned&#xD;
knife and fork, in despair of eating another mouthful, and Dr.&#xD;
Carleton drew out his Bandanna to wipe off the coursing tears.&#xD;
"Hi~t," said Ida, her finger uplifted, "some one is coming !"&#xD;

The roll of an approaching vehicle was plainly heard; the coach-&#xD;
man's sharp "Whoa I" followed by a cheer, in sound like a view-&#xD;
hallo, but it said, "Ship ahoy !"&#xD;
"Chancy! Charley I" screamed Carry, upsetting the tea-urn&#xD;
on her way to the door, pursued by Arthur and Dr. Carleton.&#xD;
Ida went as far as the porch. She heard Mrs. John Dana's&#xD;
voice, then her husband's; and Elle's incoherent response to the&#xD;
efforts made to awaken her; but the stranger was chief spokes-&#xD;
man. "hook after your wife and the baggage, John; I will&#xD;
disembark the lighter freight. Elle! Elle! don't you want to&#xD;

Aunt Carry, 'and a nice supper. Charley! you monkey! wide~&#xD;

And with the "small-sized bundle" in his armshe marched up.&#xD;
the walk, Carry scolding and laughing.&#xD;
"Charley! you are too bad! give her to me-a pretty figure&#xD;

"He has carried her, or Elle, before him, on the horse, all&#xD;

warmly kissing her." John Dana shook hands with her, and&#xD;
Elle cried, "Cousin Ida! ~yot~ here at grandpa's !"&#xD;
Charley gave a comic glance at his burden, when he was pre-&#xD;
sented; hut his bow was respectful, and as graceful as the case&#xD;
admitted. Ida hardly saw, him until the' second supper was&#xD;
served; Carry insisting that she should occupy ~her accustomed&#xD;
seat, and go through the form of eating. Elle petitioned for a&#xD;
chair l~y her, and the three brothers were together on the opposite&#xD;
side o~' the table. They were an interesting study. John,&#xD;
with ~is strong, dark, yet singularly pleasing physiognomy, was&#xD;
the ha dsomest; but his precedence in age, and perhaps rougher&#xD;
experiences in life, had imparted an air of command, which, while&#xD;
'it became him well, deterred one from familiarity. Charley was&#xD;
so unlike him, that the supposition Qf their being of the same&#xD;
lineage, seemed absurd. His hair and complexion were many&#xD;
shades lighter, and the feature~ cast in a different mould~ his&#xD;
eyes the only fine ones in the set. He was not so tall, by a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
head, and more slightly built. Arthur was the' connecting link;&#xD;
with John's height, and Charley's. figure; the perfect mouth and&#xD;
teeth of one; the brown eyes of the other; and hair and skin a&#xD;
juste n~ilieu between the two. Ida's attention was most frequently&#xD;
directed to the new-coiner. She' thought him more homely thaiL&#xD;
his brothers; and it certainly was not a family resemblance that&#xD;
troubled her with the notion, that she had seen him somewhere&#xD;
not very lor~g ago-when,' she could not say-except that his&#xD;
expression was not the same as now. Heedless of her observa-&#xD;
tion, he rattled on; doing ample justice to the edibles, in some&#xD;
unaccountable manner'; his gastronomical and vocal apparatus&#xD;
never interfering; yet withal, he was. an excellent listener; and&#xD;
allowed the rest of the party to say whatever they wished. "He&#xD;
would be worth his weight in gold to a comic almanac-maker,"&#xD;
thought Ida, as he dashed off caricature and anecdote, conveying&#xD;
a character in an epithet, and setting the table in a roar, by a&#xD;
grimace or inflection. His pictures, however,    ured by&#xD;
his gay mood; there were no frowning portraits, and their smiles&#xD;
were all broad grins.&#xD;
"You have not learned to love buttermilk, yet, Charrey ?"&#xD;
said Carry, as John called for a secoiid tumbler of the cooling&#xD;
beverage.&#xD;
"Can't say that I have. Did I Write you an account of my&#xD;
begging expedition ?"&#xD;
"iBeggingjl no-tell me now.&#xD;
"It was in the Valley. Fitzgerald and I-you know Fitz.,&#xD;
Arthur-were on a hunting frolic. We went up on the mound&#xD;
tains, and fell in with game in abundance, but despicable&#xD;
accommodations. We were at it for three days. The first&#xD;
night we 'camped out,' gipsy style; built a rousing fire t~ scare&#xD;
the wild beasts; wrapped our dreadnoughts around us, and 'lay,&#xD;
like gentlemen taking a snooze,' feet to ards the' fire, and faces&#xD;
towards the moon. It had made tip niy mind that there would&#xD;
be precious little romance, and less comfort, in this very roomy&#xD;
hotel; but Fitz. was sentimentally inclined, and I let him alone.&#xD;
'A life in the woods for me ~' said he, as he stretched himself&#xD;
upon the ground. I~was fast asleep in two minutes, so far as&#xD;
sounds went. 'Charley!' he exclaimed, at my heavy breathing.&#xD;

'Pshaw! he's off! he has no more poetry in him than there i~&#xD;
in a-rock!'&#xD;
"I guessed that he was helped to this illustration, by his dis-&#xD;
covery of the quantity of the substance in the soil thereabouts,&#xD;
for he shifted his position. He was tolerably still for about five&#xD;
minutes; then there was a jerk, and 'I have not picked the&#xD;
softest spot, surely!' After another season of quiet came,&#xD;
'How he. sleeps! if he were to swap sides with me, he would&#xD;
not be disturbing the echoes in that style!'&#xD;
"A brief objurgation to an unnamed annoyance, was comment&#xD;
fourth. I slept on perseveringly. He bore it for an hour and&#xD;
then got up and mended the fire, by which he was moodily&#xD;
seated, when I awoke from my first nap. 'Hallo!' said I, rub..&#xD;
bing my eyes, 'Is it morning?' 'No! and what's more, I don't&#xD;
believe it's ever coming ?' with a savage accent. 'Ah well ! just&#xD;
hail me when it does break,' and 12 dropped back 'Th~it is more&#xD;
than flesh and blood can bear!' said he, with awful deliberate-&#xD;
ness, 'Here I can't get a wink of sleep, and you are snoring&#xD;
away with a forty horse~ power. Maybe you think you are on a&#xD;
feather bed, man!' fiercely ironical.&#xD;
"'A feather bed!' jus~t opening my eyes-' a feather bed is&#xD;
nothing to it, Fitz.'&#xD;
"'I believe you!' he said.&#xD;
"The morning did come, and we had splendid shooting, and&#xD;
happened on a log cabin that night, where we were permitted to&#xD;
lodge; leaving most of our game for its mistress, who: refused&#xD;
money for her hospitality. By three o'clock of the last day, we&#xD;
turned our faces towards home, and by rare luck, overtook a man&#xD;
who lived upon Fitz.'s farm, him we loaded with our guns an~,&#xD;
game-bags, he being on horseback, and fresh, we on foot and&#xD;
tired. Presently a traveller passed us, crossing to the other&#xD;
side of the road, and eyeing us suspiciously. 'Fitz.,' observed I,&#xD;
'How hard that man looked at you. You are not&#xD;
holiday trim, my dear fellow ~                 exactly in&#xD;
"I haveiCt seen any man, or thought of myself, I was too&#xD;

rest. We shall hear criticisms enough, I'll warrant.'&#xD;
"We were ripe for fun; and reaching a small farm-house, Fits.&#xD;
opened the gate. 'Recollect we ktiow no Inglese 1' We were&#xD;
grotesque figures, wearing bell.crowt'ed hats of white felt, drab&#xD;
wrappers, coated with mud, and green-hunting shirts. Add a&#xD;
beard of three days' growth, and brigandish mustachios, and you&#xD;
have our 'picters.' The men were off at work, but the women&#xD;
peeped at us from all quarters. Fitz. walked meekly up to a&#xD;
girl who was washing in the yard.&#xD;

~cWhatdidyou do?"&#xD;
"I drank it! absolutely! Iwho had never looked at a churn&#xD;
without shuddering. I desired to make a favorable impression.&#xD;
The children were gaping at the sights; and I contrived, before&#xD;
handing the bowl to one of them, to drop a piece of money into&#xD;
the milk left in the bottom 'for manners.' I wished it back in&#xD;
my pocket, as the old hag, after a prolonged stare, pointed her&#xD;
skinny hand at me, 'Sary, 1 think this 'ere one is rather the&#xD;

"Fitz. burst into a laugh, that scared them all in one direc-&#xD;
tion, while we beat a retreat in the other."&#xD;
"A hearty laugh helpeth di~estiou,". said Dr. Carleton, setting&#xD;
back in his chair. "Miss Ida, if you and Charley will under-&#xD;

"What casualty 7" asked Chancy.&#xD;
The doctor explained.&#xD;
"And you seize upon a prime lot of choice spirits, as a sub-&#xD;
stitute for your tinctures and drugs. Fie, Doctor! I thought&#xD;
you were a temperance man I"&#xD;
".1 have the best right o your services," said Carry, clasping&#xD;
her hands around his arm and walking with him towards the&#xD;
parlor. "And I forward you, I have enough for you to do.&#xD;
Ida and I have moped h re for a fortnight, without a single&#xD;
frolic, and with an ala scanty supply of beaux."&#xD;
He looked down at her, as he would have done at Elle.&#xD;
"You ride, do you not ?"&#xD;
"There i~ a pleasant fiction that we have morning excursions,&#xD;
daily; but history records but three such felicitous events."&#xD;
"Where was Arthur 7"&#xD;
"Hush, n~y dear sir, the country is sickly;. and -" she&#xD;
said, sotto voce, "He will not hear of father's going out after&#xD;
night-fall;, and they have had several difficult cases, of late,&#xD;
demanding almost constant attendance,"&#xD;
"Then, if yoi1~ are willing, I will enter upon my duties as&#xD;
escort, to-morrow morning.~~&#xD;
"Oh! not so s on! you may have time to recover from your&#xD;
fatigue.~~&#xD;
"Fatigue! fud e! I could dance all night. Are you fond of&#xD;
riding, Miss Ross 7"&#xD;
"I used to like it; I am sadly out of practice now."&#xD;
"A fault easily cured, if you are not timid."&#xD;
"Not she I" said Carry; "and want of practice notwithstand-&#xD;
ing, she is a better horsewoman than I."&#xD;
This was demonstrated in the course of the first ride; and&#xD;
both improved rapidly under the tuition of their self-constituted&#xD;
instructor.&#xD;
John returned to the city; Arthur's time was ne'~er at his&#xD;
own disposal; the care of the girls devolved entirely upon Char-&#xD;
ley. From the moment of his arrival, Ida studied him intently,&#xD;
and each hour brought difficulties, instead of elucidation. Easy&#xD;
and kind, always at their service; and performing the tasks&#xD;

assigned him, as if they were real pleasures, h~ was nothing of&#xD;
a ~" ladies' man ;" eschewed gallant speeches, and cons.igned flat-&#xD;
terers to the tender mercies of Mrs. Opie. She felt that he was&#xD;
affectionate, but would have been at a loss to produce proof&#xD;
thereof. He never let fall a syllable of endearment, yet Carry&#xD;
and the children read something in his face which said wore.&#xD;
His tastes were cultivated, and his mind well-informed, but he&#xD;
set at naught the laws of conversa(tiOflal etiquette; his sayings&#xD;
had as marked a style as his featui~es; a style, which t~ose who&#xD;
did not know better, termed droll ~' and those who dk~, dubbed&#xD;
"Charley's;" it was referable to no thing or person else. His&#xD;
candor was not his least remarkable trait. He was obstinately&#xD;
silent when appealed to for an opinion, or gave it rough-hewn;&#xD;
no rounding-off of sharp corners; no filling out here, or sloping&#xD;
in there, so as to fit neatly to another's. y1~e made no distinc-&#xD;
tions of rank; pulled off his hat to t me nest field-hand, with&#xD;
as gentle courtesy as though h&amp;amp;had been the President; and&#xD;
severed the thread of her most sprightly narrations, to thank&#xD;
the ragged urchin, who unfastened gates, or let down drawbars,&#xD;
in their desultory excursions.&#xD;
"He is one of the best of men,"~ delivered Mammy, as fore-&#xD;
man of the kitchen jury. Ida smiled at the harum-scaruin&#xD;
fig re, which arose in her mind, in opposition to the image bf&#xD;
~an tity, Mammy's description should have summoned.&#xD;
"You do not do him justice, Ida~" observed Carry.&#xD;
' My smile was not of unbelief, ~ut amusement; I like him.&#xD;
Th re is a rich vein of quaint humor in his mind; and his uneb-&#xD;
bin spirits entitle him to the honors of the laughing philosopher."&#xD;
He is more than that-"&#xD;
Who was it I heard wishing for a frolic ?" asked Charley,&#xD;
coming in. "I met a boy with a basket full of perfumery and&#xD;
white satin ribbon, at the gate. I had to stand between him&#xD;
and the wind, while he gave me these. 'Miss Carleton'-' Miss&#xD;
Ross'-' Dr. Dana and brother,' they would swindLe a~ fellow out&#xD;

"Whom did he marry ?"&#xD;
"He ist~'t married at all; on the 20th, he is to conduct to the&#xD;
hymeneal altar, the beautiful Miss Sophia Morris, of Richmond,&#xD;
Virginia."&#xD;
"No newspaper reporter could be more explicit. You will go ?"&#xD;
"That depends upon Miss Ross' inclinations, and somebody's&#xD;
gallantry.".&#xD;
"Poor dependence-~--that last! Do you know the bride elect&#xD;
-that i~ to be ?"'&#xD;
"The bride elect, that is-is sister to a school-mate of ours;&#xD;
and I have some acquaintance with herself."&#xD;
"Ellen will be with her sister," said Ida. "I shall enjoy&#xD;
meeting her. Her laugh will carry us back to days of yore."&#xD;
* "To days of yore," said Charley, balancing to an imaginary&#xD;
partner. "Is it three or four, weeks since you parted? In a&#xD;
young lady's calendar, month is an age; six months eternity.&#xD;
You look upon me as a miracle of longevity, do you not ?"&#xD;
"As old enough to be less saucy," said Carry. "Do you&#xD;
know that this habit of catching up one's words is very rude ?"&#xD;
He threw quick glance to Ida. "Miss Ross is not offended,&#xD;
I4trust. Nothing was further from my intention than to wound&#xD;
or~ offend. I am too prone to speak without thought. Forgive&#xD;
m~ this time."&#xD;
"Upon two conditions."~&#xD;
"Name them."&#xD;
"First, that you never again imagine an apology due, when&#xD;
no offence has been committed; secondly, that you drop that&#xD;
very punctilious 'Miss Ross,' and adopt your brother's manner&#xD;
of address."&#xD;
"Agreed Ito both. If I presume upon my privileges, I rely&#xD;
upon you for admonition."&#xD;
"And this party ?" said Carry. "Sit down and be a good&#xD;
boy, while Ida and I talk it over."&#xD;
He brought up a stool in front of their sofa, and, . knees at a&#xD;
right angle, feet close, together; and folded hands, waited humbly&#xD;
for the crumbs that night be flung to him.&#xD;
"It is eight miles, off," said Carry, "but there will be a&#xD;

She aimed a blow at him with her fan,' whioh he dodged.&#xD;
"IL am so little acquainted with them," objected Ida.&#xD;
"That's nothing. Mr. and Nirs. Truman are the most&#xD;
hospitable of human beings, and Mary ie a lovely girl&#xD;
Per latest steamer from Paradise.")&#xD;
"We must go. Sister is here to keep father company. Now&#xD;
the last query-what shall we wear ?"&#xD;
,("The first shall be last.")&#xD;
"White muslins," returned Ida.&#xD;
"Yes; and the thinnest we have. Nothing else is endurable&#xD;

(" Except iced juleps I")&#xD;
"Arthur I" cried Carry, with a pretty affection of vexation.&#xD;
('Come in, and keep your brother quiet I"&#xD;
"What is he doing? he seems very harmless," said Dr. Dana,&#xD;
stepping through the window from the piazza.&#xD;
The maligned individual applied his fist to his eye. "I ain't&#xD;
a-touching nothing I"&#xD;
"I am security for his good behaviour," continued Arthur,&#xD;
laying his arm across his shoulder. "Proceed with the case in&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE.most spacious of Mrs. Truman's chambers were prepared&#xD;
for the ladies' dre~ssing-room, on the. evening of the party; and&#xD;
there were no spare corners, although several of the neighbours&#xD;
offered their houses for the use of those who dared not tempt&#xD;
the chance of cri~mpled robes and disarranged coiffures; the&#xD;
probable consequence of a ride eight or ten miles in gala dress.&#xD;
Every stage, of the toilet was in progress, from the chrysalis of&#xD;
the dressing-gown to the full-winged butterfly, the sylph, who,&#xD;
with a ~dainty adjustment of her diaphanous drapery, and a last,&#xD;
Jingering look at the flattering mirror, declared herself "ready."&#xD;
Ida and Carry were bent upon dressing alike; no .easy matter&#xD;
to do, consistently with their perceptions of colours and fitness.&#xD;
one hue became both; so they proscribed the prismatic tints&#xD;
~nd appeared in virgin white. Carry was beautiful as a dream'&#xD;
of Fairy Land. The plump, white arms were bare to the&#xD;
shoulder, and without other ornament than their own fairness,&#xD;
except a chain of gold, attached to a locket, containing her&#xD;
parents' hair. This she never left off. Snowy gloves hid hands,&#xD;
softer still; the exquisitely-fitted eorsage, and the waist it en.&#xD;
clasped, were the admiration, and, if truth must be told, the envy&#xD;
of the bevy of talkative damsels; but few remarked upon these&#xD;
after a sight of her face. Her hair would eurl, do what she&#xD;
would; the rebellious bandeaux refused to be plastered upon the&#xD;
blue.veined temples, but rippled and glittered, like nothing but&#xD;
a stream, golden in the sunset. The most artful soi~p~on of&#xD;
rouge was a palpable counterfeit compared with her living&#xD;
bloom; pearls lay between the ruby lips; and a spirit, more&#xD;
priceless then gold or rubies, or pearls beamed from the liquid&#xD;
eyes. Ida looked forward with delight to Arthur's exnltant.&#xD;
smile, when he should behold her; and Carry, a like forgetful of&#xD;
self, was lost in gratified contemplation of the elegant figure' of&#xD;
her friend. With not a tithe of the beauty of half the girls&#xD;
present, her tout ensemble was striking and attractive. The&#xD;
haughtiness which held the crowd at a distance, save a high-bred&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
tone to her bearing, and one sentence, uttered in her clear voice,&#xD;
and a smile dispelled all unfavorable impressions.&#xD;
Arthur and Charley were at the foot of the stairs.&#xD;
"What a Babel I" said Ida, as they entered the thronged&#xD;
rooms.&#xD;
"And what a waste of breath I" replied Charley. "There is&#xD;
neither sociability, or rational enjoyment, to be had in these&#xD;
very large assemblies~?'&#xD;
"I rather like the excitement of the crowd ;" said Ida, "it&#xD;
affects me strangely, but agreeably; with the same sensation the&#xD;
waves may feel in their sports,-a tumultuous glee at being a&#xD;
part of the restless whole,-never still, and always bounding&#xD;
onward."&#xD;
"How do you account for it? Is it magnetism-animal&#xD;
electricity 7"&#xD;
"Perhaps so. If, as' some contend, we are electrical machines,&#xD;
the revolving currents of' the subtle fluid must operate powerfully&#xD;
upon the system of each, in a crowd like this.. But to leave&#xD;
speculative ground-~--perilous to me, inasmuch as I do not know&#xD;
what II am talking about&#xD;
"And I understand the science less," interrupted, he. "You&#xD;
remember the Scotchman's definition of metaphysics-what were&#xD;
you going to ask ?"&#xD;
"Why you dislike these scenes? I fancied you would be in&#xD;
your element."&#xD;
"Excuse me for saying that I suspect you class me among&#xD;
amphibious creatures-a sui generis-equally at home in the air,&#xD;
earth, and water, and not over-well qualified for any of these&#xD;
~tate5 of existence."&#xD;
Ida would have disclaimed; but he had come too near the&#xD;
mark; the eyes that asked a reply were penetrating as laughing;&#xD;
she was thankful that the bridal party released. her from their&#xD;
regards.&#xD;
"The bride is pretty," he observed, when the confusion was a&#xD;
little over.&#xD;
"Tame praise for such beauty," said Ida.&#xD;
"What then? superb-magnificent ?~ and if I wish to describe&#xD;
the Alps or Niagara, can you help me to a word ?"&#xD;
"You do not affect the florid atyle now in vogue ?"&#xD;

"No. It is the vice of American language and 1iterati~re.&#xD;
We 'pile on the agony,' until the idea is smothered; plain wo~ds&#xD;
lose their meaning, become too weak. to go alone, and have to&#xD;
be bolstered up' by sonorous adjectives."&#xD;
Ida smiled, and turned her, head to look for Ellen Morris.&#xD;
Charley remarked the movement, and imitated it.&#xD;
"Ha! can it be !" he exclaimed.&#xD;
"What!" she questioned.&#xD;
"I cannot be mistaken! i~ is he! What wind has blown him&#xD;
hither? An old~-J thought, a transatlantic friend; the gentle-&#xD;
man with the moustache, conversing with one of the bridesmaids."&#xD;
"Ellen Morris~ I seehim; but he deserves more than the&#xD;
doubtful designation of the 'gent~man with the moustache.'&#xD;
Who, and what is he ?"&#xD;
"An artist and poet, just returned from Italy, and the hero of&#xD;
divers adventures, which, as you lov~ the romantic, I may relate&#xD;
to you in my p6or way some day. His cognomen is Lynn&#xD;
Holmes."&#xD;
"He looks the poet; how handsome !"&#xD;
"'Tame praise fo~ such beauty,'" quoted Charley, with mock&#xD;
gravity.         I&#xD;
* It was, when applied 'to the face 'and form before them. He&#xD;
was not above *the medium height; symmetrically proportioned,&#xD;
hair purplish in its blackness, the arched nostril, and short upper&#xD;
lip indicative of spirit and gentle birth, and the rich, warm com-&#xD;
plexion had caught its flush from Italian suns. Its rapid fluctua-&#xD;
tions, pThinly visible through the transparent olive of his cheek,&#xD;
spoke too, of passions kindled by that burning clime. But his&#xD;
eyes! Ida's were darker, as she gazed into their midnight-.&#xD;
large and dreamy and melancholy! a world of unwritten poetry;&#xD;
but when did poet have, or artist paint such!&#xD;
"What is the conclusion of the whole matter ?" asked Oharley,'&#xD;
patiently.&#xD;
"That you shQuld speak to your' friend~ letting go his arm.&#xD;
"I shall not mind your leaving me alone."&#xD;
He replaced her hand. "Coutent yourself. Miss Morris&#xD;
will not thank me, if I intrude at present. 'There is time enough.&#xD;
Pity he has chosen a starving profession."&#xD;
"And' why 'pity,' if in so doing he has followed the beckon...&#xD;
&#xD;
4'&#xD;
&#xD;
ing of genius? He has hearkened to, and obeyed th~ teachings&#xD;
of his higher ~kature. Can they mislead ?"&#xD;
"When we mistake their meaning. Genius steers wildly&#xD;
astray if the compass-box of judgment is wanting.' My remark&#xD;
~as a general one~~-seeing hyr grave look. "Holmes 'is one of&#xD;
~he gifted of the earth; and whei~ I lamented his choice~ of a pro-&#xD;
fession, I did not censure him, but the public. He ought to&#xD;
have a nabob's fortune to perfect his schemes; and he will not&#xD;
make a living. Men squander thousands for the intellectual&#xD;
gratification of a horse-race; an exhibition in which, I allow, the&#xD;
brute is generally the nobler animal ;.-and knowingly brand&#xD;
him 'a verdant 'un,' who expends a quarter of that sum in works&#xD;
of art. Will you dance? I hear a violin."&#xD;
"I think not. It is too warm."&#xD;
"To say nothing of the crowd. In dancing, as inmost things,&#xD;
I prefer standing upon my own footing~-not upon other people's&#xD;
toes."&#xD;
Nevertheless, there were those present who could not withstand&#xD;
the allurement of a "hop," under any circumstances; and by&#xD;
snug packing on the part of the soberly-inclined, wh'le numbers&#xD;
sought the freer air of the passages and piazzas,' room was made&#xD;
for a set. Ellen Morris joined it, and Mr. Holmes had time to&#xD;
look about him. His start of. delight as he recognized Charley,&#xD;
and the heartiness of their greetings, showed their mutual attach-&#xD;
ment; and imagining that they would have much to say after a&#xD;
lengthy separation, Ida would have fallen in the rear, had not&#xD;
Charley forestalled her by. a prompt presentation ~f his friend.&#xD;
They exchanged, indeed, one or two brief questions and replies;&#xD;
but these over, she was the centre of attraction. The panting,&#xD;
heated dancers tripped by, commiserating, if they noticed the&#xD;
"hum-drum" group at the window; never thinking that, demure&#xD;
as they appeared, there was more enjoyment in that secluded&#xD;
recess, than in the entire mass of revellers besides. There are&#xD;
harmonies in conversation, the arrangement of which is woefully&#xD;
disregarded. Accident had collected a rare trio. The artist&#xD;
talked as he would have painted; decrying beauties everywhere,&#xD;
and bringing them together with a masterly hand; only tolerating&#xD;
deformity, as it displayed them to more advantage, and shedding&#xD;
over all the mellow glow of his fervid imagination; startlir~g by&#xD;

&#xD;
paradoxes, to enchant by the grace and beauty of their reconcilia-&#xD;
'tion. And Charley, with a cooler brain tind wary eye, was&#xD;
ready to temper, not damP his enthusiasm ;-not to dam the'&#xD;
rushing flood, but lead it aside into a smoother chanxi~l. Ida&#xD;
thought of the compass-box, .and charmed as she, ~was by the.&#xD;
eloquence of this modern Raphael, acknowledged the justice of&#xD;
the simile. For herself; appreciative and suggestive, she fanned&#xD;
the flame. Mer sympathetic glance and smile, the quick catching&#xD;
at a thought, half unuttered; the finish and polish his crude&#xD;
ideas received from her lighter hand, could not but please and&#xD;
flatter. How grating was the interruption I.-.&#xD;
"Mr. Dana! not dancing !'~&#xD;
"No, Mr. Truman, but exceedingly well entertained."&#xD;
"Hav'nt a doubt of it! hav'nt a doubt! but there's a young&#xD;
lady--a stranger-who wants a partner for the set that is form-&#xD;
ing, and as your~ brother is eiigaged-to dance, I mean-with&#xD;
Miss Somebody-I forget who-I thought as an old friend, I&#xD;
would make so free as to call upon you, ah-ah---she being a&#xD;
stranger, you understand, ah-ah-&#xD;
"Certainly sir, of course, where is she ?" said Charley, swal-&#xD;
lowing his chagrin, in his willingness to oblige the embarrassed&#xD;
host. "Charles Dana, 'having gone to see his partner,' desires&#xD;
the prayers of the congregation," he said aside to~ his tompa-&#xD;
nions, before plunging into the throng.&#xD;
'%' 0, rare Ben Jonson!'" said Mr. Holmes, as they disap-&#xD;
peared.&#xD;
"And most incomprehensible of aiAomalies I" responded Ida.&#xD;
"The dross is upon the surface-refined gold beneath. Have&#xD;
you known him long 7"&#xD;
"But a fortnight."&#xD;
"You have not mastered the alphabet yet. 'Bright and danc-&#xD;
in~ as is that eye, I have seen it shed tears in abundance and&#xD;
softness, like a woman's. His tongue knows other language than&#xD;
that of 'flippant trifling."&#xD;
"He is a universal favorite. I am surprised he has never&#xD;
married~."&#xD;
Mr. Holmes 'was ~ilent. ~Ie even looked pained; and 'Ida,&#xD;
conscious that she ,had unwittingly touched a sore spot, took up&#xD;
the strain Mr. Truman had broken. She was in the Coliseum&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.        -               97&#xD;
of Rome; when among the moving sea of faces precipitated upon&#xD;
the ~retina, yet nothing to the brain, unless, perhaps, making&#xD;
more vivid its conceptions of the multitude, who onco lined the&#xD;
crumbling walls of the amphitheatre-one arrested her atten-&#xD;
tion. The subject was thrilling; the speaker's description gra-&#xD;
phic and earnest ;-it was unkind, and ungrateful, and disre-'&#xD;
spectful-but laugh she must, and did, when in Charley's&#xD;
partner she beheld Celestia Pratt! Her first emotion was&#xD;
extreme amusement; her next, indignant compassion for him&#xD;
thrust into public notice as the cavalier of a tawdry fright; for&#xD;
the thickest of satin robes, and a load of jewelry, that gave plau-&#xD;
sibility to the tale of Hannibal's spoils at Cann~, betrayed,&#xD;
instead of cloaking vulgarity. He was playing the agreeable,&#xD;
however, with his wanted sang-froid, varied, as she judged from&#xD;
his gestures, by gratuitous hints as to the figure and ~tep. In&#xD;
trying to elface the remembrance of her rudeness from Mr~&#xD;
Holmes' mind, 'and watching the oddly matched pafr, she passed&#xD;
the time until the set was finished. Arthur approached, and the&#xD;
gleam of his white teeth upset her acquired gravity.&#xD;
"Caught," said he, as Mr. Holmes walked away, "just as&#xD;
was. I secured a partner directly I saw her; and Mr. Truman,&#xD;
hearing from her that I was an acquaintance, put' at me two&#xD;
minutes later."&#xD;
"He said you were engaged-to dance."&#xD;
"Here he is! Charley, I thought you declined dancing?'&#xD;
"So I did. I consented to please Mr. Truman."&#xD;
" Had you ever seen your partner before 7"&#xD;
No.' I know what you are at, Art., but I cannot laugh with&#xD;
you. I am sorry for her."&#xD;
"You shame us, Mr. Dana," said Ida, frankly. "I will&#xD;
make amends fQr my uncharitableness, by fighting my way, sin-&#xD;
gle.handed, to the farthest end of the room, to speak to her, if&#xD;
you say ~&#xD;
"And I, not to be outdone, will dance with her," said Arthur,&#xD;
with a martyr-air.&#xD;
"I 'absolve you," said his brother. "She is a queer. fish, I&#xD;
own," in his light tone~ "Have you spoken to Holmes 7"&#xD;
"Yes. He says ~he l~as partly resolved to whiter in Rich-&#xD;

"Will he come 7"&#xD;
"Probably."&#xD;
A succession of introductions and beaux engaged Ida until.&#xD;
supper. She forgot her purpose of speaking with Celestia, apd&#xD;
would not have remembered her again that evening, had she not&#xD;
- been made aware of her proximity at table by something between&#xD;
a grunt and exclamation, forced through a mouthful of cake.&#xD;
* "Lor! if that ain't Idy Ross I"&#xD;
She had a saucer of ice-cream in one hand, and a slice of fruit-&#xD;
cake in her left; so she stuck out a red elbow in lieu of either;&#xD;
which unique salutation Ida pretended not to see.&#xD;
are you, Celestia? When did you come into the&#xD;
neighbourhood 7"&#xD;
"I jest got down yesterday. You see," in a stage whisper,&#xD;
"I heard of this party better'n a fortnight ago, and ma and I&#xD;
- set our hearts 'pon my coming; so I had this dress made (it&#xD;
cost four dollars a yard !) and Itappened, you know, to pay a&#xD;

Mrs. Truman, found out, you know, that I was there, and sent&#xD;
me a 'bid.' Didn't I manage it nice 7"&#xD;
"You appear to be having a pleasant time.&#xD;

"Miss Ross, what shall. I have the pleasure of helping. you&#xD;

"She named an article, and Celestia twitched her arm-&#xD;
C'Who  that?"              -&#xD;
"Mr. Euston," said Ida, distinctly.&#xD;
"Isheyourbeau?&#xD;
"Then you'd' as lief as not interduce me, hadn't you? Ife's&#xD;
the loveliest thing I ever saw.,&#xD;
Ida flushed with disgust and vexation; the insufferable con-&#xD;

notice ,of many to them; and her horror of ridicule was strong&#xD;
upon her.&#xD;

marked his expression, and the sc~ne in the painting-room, Jose-&#xD;
phine's derision, and the rude 'mirth of her supporters, her hur-&#xD;
ricane of rage and the commanding look, that said to it "Be&#xD;
still," all rushed over her like a whirlwind, and departed. sud-&#xD;
denly. 1~r. Euston was bowing with the desired delicacy;&#xD;
Celestial, serenely expectant, and. with the ndin of one who con-&#xD;
fers a fav4ir upon both parties, she complied with the fair lady's&#xD;
request. Mr Euston was handsome and gallant; he iinmedi-&#xD;
ately dipped into his stock of pretty sayings, and presented one&#xD;
of the most elegant. The recipient fluttered and prinked, and&#xD;
* baited another hook; and Ida stole a look at Charley. Her not&#xD;
recognizing him before was no marvel; she could hardly per-&#xD;
suade herself that her ~conviction of a minute before was~ not an&#xD;
illusion; so impervious was the Momus mask. He was fre-&#xD;
quently near, and with her, in the course of the evening: but&#xD;
no sign betokened a ~usp~ciou of her perplexity. He was gayer&#xD;
than his wont; when sh~er fatigue drove the votaries of pleasure&#xD;
from the festive hall, his spirits were at their meridian. He had&#xD;
passed most of the day oi~ horseback; had talked and danced and&#xD;
stood for six hours; yet 4~e sent off carriage, after carriage with a&#xD;
lively a dieu; and seeing his own party seated in theirs, vaulted&#xD;
into the saddle, as for a morning gallop. He cheered the weary&#xD;
travellers so long as he could extort replies from th~ lagging&#xD;
tongues, artd serenaded them the rest of the way with snatches&#xD;
of melody fantastic as his mood.&#xD;
"Why have you and Charle~y preserved such a mysterious&#xD;
silence respecting our former meeting ?" inquired Ida, when she&#xD;
j    - and Carry were laid down to sleep.&#xD;
"He charged me not to name him, if I heard the matter&#xD;
alluded to; and, since we have been at home, enjoined secrecy&#xD;
more strictly, saying the incident was better forgotten than&#xD;
remembered," said Carry, dozingly.&#xD;
This was Thursday. On Saturday the young artist made one&#xD;
in their midst. In his school-days he was a welcome guest at&#xD;
Poplar-grove, spending a portion of his vacation with his friend&#xD;
Charley, and the lapse of years had not rusted the hinges of&#xD;

the hospitable doors, or those of the master's heart. He was&#xD;
received and cherished as of old.&#xD;
Mrs. Dana looked into the girls' room before i1etining. Ida&#xD;
was brushing her hair; Carry watching and talking to her.&#xD;
"Yes," said she, complacently, appealing to her sister for con-&#xD;
firmation. "I flatter myself our party could not be more select&#xD;
or composed of choice materials. Four beaux-.including father&#xD;
-handsomest of all; and but two belles-three---pardon me,&#xD;
Mrs. Dana. It may be a century ere we are again so blessed;&#xD;
and we must go somewhere, or do something to exhibit our-&#xD;
selves. Ida may have Chanley and father, if she will leave the&#xD;
Italian and his la.mping eyes to me.&#xD;
"And Arthur-why is he neglected the division of spoils F"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Dana.&#xD;
"I make him over to you. Brother John commended you to&#xD;
his care."&#xD;
~' Mammy applied to me for numberless passes, to-night.&#xD;
There is a big meeting at Rocky Mount. The servants will&#xD;
attend en masse/to-morrow; why n~t follow their, example F"&#xD;
said Mrs. Dana, with playful irony.&#xD;
"We 'will 1" exclaimed Carry, clapping her hands.' "I'll&#xD;
ask father this minute."&#xD;
"But, my dear sister-"&#xD;
"Don't say a word, Jenny; Ida would like to go, I am sure."&#xD;
"When I understand the character of the entertainment; I&#xD;
shall be qualified' to express my wishes."&#xD;
"Why," answered Carry, tying the cord of the wrapper she&#xD;
had cast around her. "They preach a little, and sing and&#xD;
shout; and in intermission, we have grand fun~."&#xD;
"Fun! at church 1"&#xD;
"That is not the word precisely; but everybody meets every-&#xD;
body else, -and we have an hour for talking and eating. How&#xD;
happens it, that you are a novice? you are country-born."&#xD;
"I was never at a big meeting~ notwithstanding."&#xD;
"An additional reason, why we should be on the spot to~&#xD;
morrow. I will be back directly." ' /&#xD;
In five minutes she returned, blushing and laughing.&#xD;
~C Would you believe it? When I knocked at father's door,&#xD;
Arthur opened it. I slunk back in the dark, and asked for&#xD;

'Marster.' 'Docto~r,' said he, 'Martha wants to see you,' and&#xD;
sauntered off. Didn't father stare, and I laugh, when ~ ran in I&#xD;
The stupid creature.! to be fooled so easily I"&#xD;
"The meeting 1" said Ida.&#xD;
"All's well! Father was afraid we might be tired, if we&#xD;
stayed to both sermons; but I assured him that was impossible.&#xD;
I hope it will be a fine day!"&#xD;
She was gratified; but the weather-was not brighter than the&#xD;
faces gathered upon the piazza, at a. shockingly unfashionable&#xD;
hour. It was six miles' to Rocky Mount; and as Chancy&#xD;
observed, "seats in th~ dress circle would be at a premium, two&#xD;
hours before services begun."&#xD;
"'Marster' does not accompany us," said Arthur, significantly,&#xD;
as.he handed Carry into the carriage. She was too much con-&#xD;
fused to reply; but Ida and Mrs. Dana laughed outright.&#xD;
"Papa and myself, having no vagrant propensities, will go to&#xD;
our own church,". answered the latter. "And if you have waited&#xD;
upon the young ladies, I will thank you to put me into the gig,&#xD;
Pr. Dana~"&#xD;
Mr. ilolmes accepted a seat with the ladies; Chanley and&#xD;
Arthur were on horseback. It is doubtful if one of the merry&#xD;
riders realized, for an instant, thc sacredness of the day, or that&#xD;
they were bound to a place of worship. It 'did not occur, even&#xD;
to Dr. Carleton, that their glee, innocent and proper upon ordi.&#xD;
nary occasions, now verged upon sinful levity. He saw in it,&#xD;
the buoyancy of youth under the influence of agreeable company,&#xD;
and a cloud I~ss day. They would be subdued by the exercises&#xD;
of~the sancti\~ry; and he drove ~along, his large heart full of&#xD;
love and praise to Him who had showered these gem-sparkles&#xD;
into his chalice of life; the young peoplee beguiling the length&#xD;
of their journey, by a running fire of badinage, puns and senio-&#xD;
comic discussions; embarked, to' all intents and purposes, upon&#xD;
'~ party of pleasure.&#xD;
* "Behold ILooky Mount 1" said Arthur, pointing to a rising&#xD;
ground, tufted by o~ clump of oaks.&#xD;
"Where is the church ?" inquired Ida. "I can distinguish&#xD;
people and horses, but no house." -&#xD;
"After we get there, I will lend you my pocket microscope,"&#xD;
responded Charley. The brown walls of a small building, in&#xD;

the centre of the grove; were visible, as the road wound around&#xD;
the hill; but its dimensions were as great a puzzle as its absence&#xD;
would have been. Carry came to her aid.&#xD;
"They preach out of doors, my dear."&#xD;
"Out of doors 1" this was a charming novelty.&#xD;
"'The groves were God's first temples,'" she repeated softly,&#xD;
and Lynn continued the noble' lines-.&#xD;
"Ah, why&#xD;
Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect&#xD;
God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore,&#xD;
Only among the crowd, and under, roof's&#xD;
That 'our frail hands have raised&#xD;
Charley smiled dubiously, but held l~is peace. The crowd&#xD;
thickened with their advance. Horses were tethered in solid'&#xD;
ranks ~to the trees; children straying frightfully near to their&#xD;
heels; wagons and carriages almost piled upon each other; and&#xD;
men, white and black, stood about everywhere. The driver&#xD;
reined up, twenty yards from the arbor erected under the tre~s.&#xD;
"Drive up nearer, Tom !" said Carry.&#xD;
"Re cannot," replied Arthur, letting down the st~ps.&#xD;
"Look !"&#xD;
There was a quadruple row of vehicles on three sides of the&#xD;
arbor, the fourth being, at considerable pains, left open for&#xD;
passage. Several young men dashed to the side of the carriage,&#xD;
with as much impressment as at a ball, and thus numerously&#xD;
attended, the girls picked their way through the throng and&#xD;
dust. No gentlemen were, as yet, in their seats, land our party&#xD;
secured a vacant bench midway to the pulpit.&#xD;
"Don't sit next to the aisle," whispered Arthur.&#xD;
"Why not ?" questioned Ida, removing to the other extremity&#xD;
of the plank.&#xD;
"Oh it is more comfortable here. We will be with you&#xD;
again presently."                      Carry4hen&#xD;
"That is not all the reason," remarked           he was&#xD;
gone. "This railing protects us from the press on this side;&#xD;
and our young gentleman will not per it any one to occupy the&#xD;
8tand without, but themselves."&#xD;
"Will they not sit down'?"&#xD;
"No, indee~! there will not be roo . Then the aisles wilJ&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
*       be filled with all sorts of people, and our dresses be liable to&#xD;
damage from boots and' tobacco juice."&#xD;
"Tobacco jub~e I" was she in a barbarous country! As Carry&#xD;
predicted, their 'three attendants worked their way, between the&#xD;
wheels and the people, to where they sat. Charley crawled&#xD;
under the rail, and planted himself behind them.&#xD;
"I can keep my position until some pretty girl dislodges me,&#xD;
said he. "Thedenizens of these parts have not forgotten how&#xD;
to stare."&#xD;
He might well say so A battery of eyes was levelled upon&#xD;
them, wherever they looked. The tasteful dress and elegant&#xD;
appearance of the ladies, and their attractive suite, were subjects&#xD;
of special importance to the community at large. Although&#xD;
eclipsed in show by some present, theirs was a new constellation,&#xD;
and they must support observation as they could. 'They stood&#xD;
fire bravely; Ida was most unaccustomed to it, and she found&#xD;
so much to interest and divert her, that she became unconscious&#xD;
of the annoyance after a little.&#xD;
"Are those seats reserved for distinguished strangers? have&#xD;
notw9 a right to them ?" designating a tier in front of the&#xD;
speaker's stand.&#xD;
"They are the anxious benches," returned Charley.&#xD;
"Nonsense I"&#xD;
"So I think. The brethren dissent~ from us. I am not&#xD;
quizzing. That is the name."&#xD;
"The mourners-the convicted occupy them," said Carry~.&#xD;
"Are they here ?" inquired Ida, credulously. It was prepos..&#xD;
terous to conceive such a possibility in this frivolous loud-talking&#xD;
assembly.&#xD;
"Not' now;" answered Charley. "But when they crowd on&#xD;
the steam, you will witness scores.'~&#xD;
"Fie! Charley? it is wicked to speak so 1"&#xD;
"I am just as pious as if I did not, Carry. I'll wager my&#xD;
horse-and head too-that by to-night, Miss Ida will agree with&#xD;
me, that these religious frolics are more hurtful to the cause they&#xD;
are intended to advance, than fifty such harmless affairs, as we&#xD;
attefrded on Thursday night."&#xD;
"I am not solemnised yet;" said Ida.&#xD;
"You are as solemn as you are going to be. You may be&#xD;

excited, or frightened into something like gravity. Two, three,&#xD;
four preachers!' .That's what I call a waste of the raw material.&#xD;
What a flutter of ribbons and fans! The congregation reminds&#xD;
me of a clover field, with, the buttert~ies hovering over its gaily-&#xD;
colored, bobbing heads. Handsome ladies by doze s! This&#xD;
county is famed for its beauty, and but one tolerabi -looking&#xD;
man in its'length and breadth 1"&#xD;
"Why, there is Mr. Euston-what fault have you o find in&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
"'He is the honorable exception. Whom did you think I&#xD;
me~tnt ?" smiling mischievously at Carry's unguarded query.&#xD;
"Art. here, is passable. Modesty prevents my saying more, as&#xD;
we are daily mistaken for each other. The music strikes up;-.-..&#xD;
rather quavering; they are not in the 'spirit' yet. They never&#xD;
get to the understanding~g' I must decamp. Those fair ones&#xD;
are too bashful to look is wa , while I am here."&#xD;
He was on the outside of the rail, sedate and deacon-like, in&#xD;
a minute. Unsuited as his remarks were to the time and place,&#xD;
they were less objectionable than the whispers of the ladies, who&#xD;
dispossessed him ;-critiques upon Susan's beaux and Joseph's&#xD;
sweethearts; upon faces, dress and deportment; a quantity of&#xD;
reprobation, and very sparse praises.&#xD;
The preacher was an unremarkable man, who delivered, in a&#xD;
sing-song tone, an unremarkable discourse; opposing no impedi-&#xD;
ment to the sociability of the aforementioned damsels, except&#xD;
that they lowered their shrill staccato to a piano. The gentle-&#xD;
men whispered bound their hats, notched switches, and whittled&#xD;
sticks. The hearers from Poplar-grove; 'albeit they iVere gay,&#xD;
youthful, and non-professors, were the most decorous auditors in&#xD;
their part of the congregation. Another minister ~irose; a man&#xD;
not yet in his thirtieth year, his form stooped, as beneath the&#xD;
weight of sixty winters. The crowd stilled instantly. He&#xD;
leaned, as for support, upon the primitive desk; his attenuated&#xD;
'hands clasped, his eyes moving slowly in their cavernous&#xD;
recesses, over the' vast assemblage. "And what come ye out&#xD;
into the wilderness for to see ?" he said, in a v&amp;amp;ice of preter-&#xD;
natural sweetness and strength. "Aye! ye are come as to a&#xD;
holiday pageant, bedecked in tinsel and costly raiment. I see&#xD;

One proffers you the crown of' Life 1" The bent figure straight-&#xD;
ened; the thin hands were endowed with a language of power,&#xD;
as they pointed, and shook, and glanced through the air. His&#xD;
clarion tones thrilled upon every ear, their alarms and threaten-&#xD;
ings and denunciatioils; in crashing peals, the awful names of&#xD;
the MQst High, and His condemnations of the wicked, descended&#xD;
among the throng; and those fearful eyes were fiery and wrath'-&#xD;
ful. At the climax he stopped ;-witb arms still upraised, and&#xD;
the words of woe and doom yet upon his lips, he sank upon the&#xD;
arm of a brother beside him, and was led to his seat, ghastly as&#xD;
a corpse, and nearly as helpless.&#xD;

"This is the field, the world below,--&#xD;

"For soon the reaping time will come,&#xD;

The ministers came down from the stand, ~iJnd distributed&#xD;
themselves among the people; bowed heads and shaking forms&#xD;

the throng, rushed up to thd mourner's seats, and flung herself&#xD;
upon her knees with a piercing cry ;-another and another ;~&#xD;

and the shout of the resurrection morn, arose the surge ~f song;-~&#xD;
"For soon the reaping time will come&#xD;
And angels shout the harvest home I"&#xD;
Carry trembled and shrank; and Ida's firmer nerves were&#xD;
quivering. A lull in the storm, and a man knelt in the aisle,&#xD;
to implore "mercy and pardon for a dying sinner, who would&#xD;
not try to avert the wrath to come." -&#xD;
Sonorous accents went on with his weeping petition ;-.praying&#xD;

"the hardened, thoughtless transgressors-those who, had&#xD;
either part nor lot in this matter; who stood afar off, despising&#xD;
a~d reckless." .Aigain rolled out a chorus; speaking now of&#xD;
j ~yful assurance.&#xD;
"Jesus myall to heaven has gone~-&#xD;
(When we get to h ~aven we will part no more,)&#xD;
He whom I fix my hopes upon-&#xD;

When we get to he yen we will part no more,&#xD;
Oh! Fare-you-well !"&#xD;
Ida's eyes brimmed, and Carry sobbed with over-wrought&#xD;
feeling. Arthur bent over the railing and spoke to the latter.&#xD;
He looked troubled,-but for her: Lynn stood against one of&#xD;
the pillars which supported the roof; arms crossed, and a redder&#xD;
mantling of his dark cheek; Charley was cool and grave, taking&#xD;
in the Scene in' all its parts, with no sympathy with any of the&#xD;
phases of emotion. The tumult increased; shouted thankgivings,&#xD;
and wails of despair; singing and praying and exhorting, clash-&#xD;
ing in wild confusion.&#xD;
"You had best not to stay here," said Arthur to Parry, whose&#xD;
struggles for composure he could not bear to see.&#xD;
"Suffer me to pass, Dr. Dana;" and a venerable minister&#xD;
stooped towards the weeping girl. "My daughter, why do you&#xD;
remain here, so far from those who can do you good? You are&#xD;
distressed on account of sin; are you ashamed to have it known?&#xD;
Do you not desire the prayer of Christians? I will not affirm&#xD;
that you cannot be saved anywhere; 'the arm of the Lord is not&#xD;
shortened,' but I do warn you, that if you hang back in pride or&#xD;
stubbornness, you will. be lost; and these only can detain you&#xD;
after what you have heard. Arise, and join that company of&#xD;
weeping mourners, it r4ay not b6 too late."&#xD;
Carry shook her head.&#xD;
"Then kneel where you are, and I will pray for you.&#xD;
-She dried~ her tears. "Why should I kneel, Mr. Manly? I&#xD;
do not experience any sorrow for sin.~~&#xD;
"My child 1"&#xD;
"My tears are not those of. penitence; I do not weep for 6iy&#xD;
sinfulness; I can neither think nor eel in this confusion."&#xD;
The good man was fairly stumbled~ by this avowal.&#xD;
"Have you no interest in this suL~ject ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not more than usual, sir. My agitation proceeded from&#xD;
animal excitement."&#xD;
"I am fearful it is the same in a majority of instances, Mr.&#xD;
Manly ;" said Arthur, respectfully.&#xD;
"You my perceive y~ur error one day, my son; let me entreat&#xD;
you to consider this matter as 'binding up your eternal welfare.;&#xD;
and caution you not to lay a feather in the way of those who may&#xD;
be seeking their salvation."&#xD;
Arthur bowed silently; and the minister passed on.&#xD;
Dr. Carleton retired early that evening with a headache.&#xD;
Mrs. D*ana was getting the children to sleep; the young people&#xD;
had the parlor to themselves. Charley was at the piano, finger-&#xD;
ing over sacred airs; psalm tunes, sung by the Covenanters, in&#xD;
their craggy temples, or murmuring an impromptu accompaxii&#xD;
ment, a chant or doxology. All at once ~ie struck the chords&#xD;
boldly, and added the full towers of the instrument to his voice,&#xD;
in the fine old melody of Brattle Street. Lynn ceased his walk&#xD;
through the room, and united his rich base at the second line;&#xD;
Arthur, a tenor; Catry and Ida were~ happy to be permitted to&#xD;
listefi--.&#xD;
"While Thee I seek, protecting Power,&#xD;
Be my vain wishes stilled;&#xD;
And may this consecrated hour&#xD;
With better hopes be filled.&#xD;
Thy love the power of thought bestowed,&#xD;
To thee my thoughts would soar;&#xD;

In each event of life how clear&#xD;

"There I" said Charley, "there is more religion in that hymn&#xD;
than in all the fustian we have heard to-day; sermons, prayers&#xD;
and exhortations. Humbug in worldly concerns is despicable;&#xD;
in the church, it is unbearable."&#xD;
"Consider, Charley, that hundred of pious people believe in&#xD;
the practices you condemn. Some of the best Christians I know&#xD;
were converted at these noisy revivals," said Carry.&#xD;
"It would be miraculous if there were not a grain or two of&#xD;
wheat in this pile of chaff. I never attend one that I am not&#xD;
the worse for, it.~ It is a regular annealing furnace; when the&#xD;
heat subsides you can neither soften or bend the heart .~igain-.&#xD;
the iron is steel. What does Miss Ida say ?"&#xD;
"That sin is no more hateful, or religion more alluring, for&#xD;
this Sabbath's 1e~sons; still, I acquiesce in Carry's belief, that&#xD;
although mistaken in their zeal, these seeming fanatics are&#xD;
sincere."&#xD;
"You applaud enthusiasm upon other si.ibjects, why not in&#xD;
religion ?" asked Lynn, "if any thing, it is everything. If Icould&#xD;
believe that, when the stormy sea of life is~ passed, heaven-an&#xD;
eternal noon-tide of love and blessedness wo~ild be mine-a life-&#xD;
time would be too short, mortal language tc~o feeble to express&#xD;
my transport. There is a void in the soul w1~ich nought but this&#xD;
can satisfy. Life is fresh to, us now; but' from the time of&#xD;
Solomon to the present, the wording has nauseated at the 'pol-&#xD;
luted spring, saying, 'For all his days are sorrow, and his travail&#xD;
grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night.' I envy-not&#xD;
carp at the joys of those whose faith, piercing through the fogs&#xD;
of this lower earth, reads. the sure promise-' It is your Father's&#xD;
&amp;amp;oAd pleasure to give you the kingdom."'&#xD;
'4d~You do hor~iage to the beauty of the Faith, by whomsoever&#xD;
professed. I. note its practical effects; judge of its genuineness&#xD;
by its workings. For example, the Old~ Harry awoke mightily&#xD;
within me, in intermission, to see Dick Rogers preaching to&#xD;
Carry, threatening her with perditjon-she, who never in her&#xD;
life, committed a tenth of the sin he is guilty of every day. He&#xD;
has been. drunk three times in the last month; he is a walking&#xD;
ilemijohn; his hypocrisy a shame to his grey hairs. And James&#xD;
Mather-he would sell his soul for a fourpence, and call it clear&#xD;
gain. Sooner than lose a crop, he forces his negroes to work on&#xD;

"Facts are obstinate things, Carry. Next to 1iein~ hypocri-&#xD;

these men in .her bosom; she must not complain, if she shares&#xD;
in the odium they merit. They are emphatically sounding&#xD;
brass."&#xD;
"Let them grow together until the harvest," said Arthur.&#xD;
"It is a convincing proof of the truth of Religion, that there are&#xD;
careful counterfeits."&#xD;
"I do not impeach the 'truth of Religion.' You need not&#xD;
speak so reproachfully, Arthur. I believe in the Christianity of&#xD;
the Scriptures. What I assail, is intermittent piety; springs,&#xD;
whose channels are dusty, save at particular seasons ;-camp-&#xD;
meetings and the like; men, who furbish up their religion, along&#xD;
with their go-to-meeting boots, andwear it no longer. Their&#xD;

* scoffer ;-I don't care. Now".-continued this contrary being,&#xD;
passing into a tone of reverent feeling ;-." There is my kind&#xD;
guardian. I don't believe he ever shouted, or made a public&#xD;
address in his life. He live8 his religion; a child can perceive&#xD;
that the Bible is a 'lamp to his feet;' a pillar of cloud in pros.&#xD;
parity; a sun in adversity. I saw it when a boy, and it did me&#xD;
more good than the preached sermons I have listened to since.&#xD;
lie called me into his study the night before I left home, and gave&#xD;
me a copy of 'the book.' 'Charley, my son,' said he, 'you are&#xD;
venturing upon untried seas; here is the Chart, to~ which I have&#xD;
trusted for twenty years; and have never been led by it, upon a&#xD;
quicksand. Look to it, my boy!' I have read it, more, because&#xD;
* he asked it, than for its intrinsic value; that is my failing, not&#xD;
his. I have waded through sloughs of theories and objections;&#xD;
b~4t hold to it still. Especially, when I am here, and kneel in&#xD;
m~ old place at the family altar; hear the solemn tones, that&#xD;
quieted my boyish gayety; when I witness his irreproachable,&#xD;
useful life, I say, 'His chart is true; would I were guided by&#xD;
it!'~ No-no-.-Art.! I ma&#xD;
skeptic."                y be careless and sinful ;---I am no&#xD;
"A skeptic," exclaimed Lynn. "There never was one!&#xD;
Voltaire was a fiend incarnate; a ~devil, who 'believed and trem-&#xD;
bled,' in spite of his hardihood; Paine, a brute, who, i~nconve~&#xD;
nienced by a soul, which would not sink as low as his j~ssions&#xD;
commanded, tried to show that he had none, as the ~easiest&#xD;
method of di~sembarrassing h~xnself. That one of God's creatures,&#xD;
* who can look up to the glories of a night like this, or s~e the&#xD;
sun rise to-morrow morning, . and peep, in his insect voice, a&#xD;
denial of Him who made the world, is demon or beast ;-often&#xD;
both. 'Call no man happy 'till he dies.' Atheists have gone&#xD;
to the stake for their opinions; but physical courage or the heat&#xD;
of fanaticism, not the belief, sustained them. We have yet to&#xD;
hear of the infidel, who died in his bed,&#xD;
'As one who wraps the drapery of his couch&#xD;
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams."'&#xD;
"It is a mystery that one can die tranquilly," said. Carry.&#xD;
"I have stood by many peaceful death.beds," returned Arthur.&#xD;
"I never wish so ardently for an interest in the Redemption, as&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
when I watch the departure of a sidnt. One verse is in my&#xD;
mind for days' afterwards. I repeat it aloud as I ride alone ;. and&#xD;
it lingers in my last waking thought at night;&#xD;
'Jesus can make a dying bed&#xD;
Feel soft as downy pillows are;&#xD;
While on his breast, I lean my head,&#xD;
And breathe my life out sweetly there.'&#xD;
"And why do you not encourage these feelings?" asked&#xD;
Charley, bluntly. "I call that conviction; a. different thing&#xD;
from the burly of t~his morning. You want to be a Christian;-&#xD;
so do I sometimes; but you are a more hopeful subject."&#xD;
"I am by no means certain of that. You would never abide&#xD;
with the half-decided, so long as I have done. You are one&#xD;
of the 'violent,' who would take the kingdom of Heaven by&#xD;
force."&#xD;
"How strange I" said Charley, thoughtfully.&#xD;
"What is strange ?" inquired his brother.&#xD;
"Here are five of us, as well-assured M the verity of Chris-&#xD;
tianity, and God's revealed Word, as of our own existence; the&#xD;
ladies, practising every Christian virtue; Lynn, prepared to&#xD;
break a lance with infidelity in any shape; you, like Agrippa,&#xD;
almost persuaded; and I, stripping off the borrowed plumage of&#xD;
those who have a name to live ;-yet we will be content to close&#xD;
.our eyes in sleep, uncertain of re~opening'them in life ;-unfit&#xD;

He turned again to the piano; Arthur quittt~d the room; Lynn&#xD;
gazed out of the window, with working features; Carry shaded&#xD;
her eyes with her hand; Ida felt a cold awe creeping over her.&#xD;
'Death and Eternity I'. had she heard the words before? how out&#xD;
of place in the bright warm life they were leading I Here were&#xD;
true friendships, tried and strengthened by years; young love,&#xD;
joying in hi~ flowery course; refined and. congenial spirits; the&#xD;
luxuries of wealth and taste ;-how unwelcome the hand that&#xD;
lifted the drapery which enveloped the skeleton! 'Death and&#xD;

threw shadows upon the grass, as of newly heaped graves; and&#xD;
the vibrating cords spoke but o~ the one~ awful theme!&#xD;

CHAPTER.&#xD;
"O~nt last ride.-.can it be 1" said Lynn, when the horses&#xD;
were brought to the gate, early in a September afternoon. Id~&#xD;
smiled faintly. The parting of the morrow, was, to her, the&#xD;
death of a summer's day, to be succeeded by wintry darkness.&#xD;
Not even Carry knew how the prospect oppressed her.&#xD;
to* Lynn saw that his remark was injudicious, and endeavoured&#xD;
atone for it, by the most delicate assiduity of attention.&#xD;
Their liking, had matured into an attachment, which might have&#xD;
been predicated upon their consonance of feeling and sentiment.&#xD;
Her calmer judgment gave her the ascendency, which belonged&#xD;
of right, to the masculine mind; he did not look up.-.she could&#xD;
not have respected. him if he had; but he consulted and appealed&#xD;
to her, as a brother v~ould ask counsel of an elder sister. She&#xD;
learned to imitate Charley, in curbing his impetuosity; and he&#xD;
chafed less at her soft touch upon the rein. No bantering&#xD;
checked the growth of 'their friendship; they were, for the time,&#xD;
members \of one family; Lynn and Charley were no more to the&#xD;
disengaged young lady than Arthur.&#xD;
Their excursion was to a splendid mansion, fifteen miles from&#xD;
Poplar-grove, lately completed, and not yet occupied by a&#xD;
wealthy landed proprietor, the Cra~sus of the county. Arthur&#xD;
had seen it, and carried home uch a report of its stately gran-&#xD;
deur, that a visit was fortliwit projected. Nature was in one&#xD;
of her richest autumnal moods.&#xD;
"She dies, as a queen shoul --id royal robes,"-..said Lynn.&#xD;
"Note the purple haze upon those bills, and the yellow glory&#xD;
that bathes the foreground! I would sacrifice this right arm,&#xD;
could I first transfer that ugh to canvass. Loveliness like this&#xD;
madden~ me with a Tantal s frenzy. To think that it must&#xD;
fade, when it should be immortal! I would have it ever before&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"It lives in your memory. That is a pleasure, time nor&#xD;
distance diminishes."&#xD;
"I am not satisfied with this selfish hoarding. A voice is&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
cries;, and while my&#xD;
ever urging me on,-' Create! create I' it&#xD;
pencil moves, I am a creator; exulting in the pictures graven&#xD;
upon my soul, as no parent ever joyed over a beloved child.&#xD;
'They are mine-mine I' I repeat in an ecstasy. I have wept&#xD;
above-almost worsilipped them Then comes the chill, grey&#xD;
light of critical reason, as when you awake at morning, and see&#xD;
things as they are: the soul-pictures are beauteous still :-my&#xD;
copy the veriest daub 1"&#xD;
"The keenness of your disappointment is an augury of success.&#xD;
The lithography is perfect-you must not despond at the failure&#xD;
of one proof~impre55ion. Your mortification is a greater triumph&#xD;
than the complacency with which a mediocre genius surveys his&#xD;
work."&#xD;
"You remember Sheridan's maiden speech," said Charley.&#xD;
"I have read of Demo~ther~ee'," replied Lynn.&#xD;
''Sheridan's was a similar case. He was hooted at for his&#xD;
presumption; his first and second attempts were wretched: and&#xD;
his friends advised him to retire from the rostrum forever.&#xD;
'Never!' said he, striking l~iis ~reast. 'It is here, and shall come&#xD;
out I"'&#xD;
"A glorious 'coming out' ~t was 1" responded Ida. "What&#xD;
do you say now ?"-to Lynn.&#xD;
"That it is here!" return g her bright look. "Was ever&#xD;
man more blessed in his friends? More fortunate than Adam, I&#xD;
take my guardian angels with me, from the Paradise I leave&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
"You must array one in a less questionable shape, if you&#xD;
- would have men admit h~is angelic relationship," said Charley,&#xD;
with a grimace. "What are you looking at 7"&#xD;
Lynn did not reply. They were upon a hill; and some object&#xD;
in the valley beneath fastened his gaze. The pensive cast of his&#xD;
features bordered upon gloom, as they neared it. Ida saw only&#xD;
a graceful knoll, bounded, except towards the west, by a chain&#xD;
of more imposing eminences. A monarch oak stood in isolated&#xD;
sovereignty upon its summits it had shaded a dwelling, for one&#xD;
chimney yet remained; and the sickly herbage of the slope was&#xD;
not the produce of a virgin soil. Ly~n stopped. Not a word&#xD;
was spoken, his eyes were too full of tender sadness; the man-&#xD;
* not the artist, looked from tb~em.&#xD;

"A lonely tree, and desolate hearth-stone !" muttered he.&#xD;
'It is prophetic !"&#xD;
"Is the spot known tq ~you ?" asked Ida, ~entlv. as thAv 1'AA~&#xD;
&#xD;
"It was my birth-pla~,e.~'&#xD;
"I ~had fo~gotton ;" ~ai'~               ere very y  ng&#xD;

and each tempting me to undertake the journey from one to the&#xD;
other. They are gone! parents, brother, sisters! there is but&#xD;

Ida turned her face a*ay. The sad story everywhere! Was&#xD;
there, justiee-there was ~t mercy..-..in thus rending away the&#xD;
* sweetest comforts man can ~rnow,-while avarice, and pride and&#xD;
malevolence rioted in unharmed ~luxuriaixce. Earth was .a cheat&#xD;
and happiness a lie!&#xD;
"~This is a fine piece of~&#xD;
over it, like     road," said Charley, "and we are&#xD;
jogging Quaker~ ~oing to market. ' I gay! Art. 1"&#xD;
'~ Well I" answered his brother, who was some yards in&#xD;
advance.&#xD;
"Don't you think your R~osinante would be' benefitted by a&#xD;
taste of the spur?"&#xD;
Oh! the delight of a sweeping gallop in the open country! the&#xD;
elate consciousness of strength and liberty, as the ma nificent&#xD;

power, free as the rushing air.-..able 'to overlap or bear down&#xD;
any obstacle! The jocund tones wafted back by the breeze&#xD;
attested the efficacy of Charley's 'prescription.&#xD;
"That bend' hides 'the Castle;"' called out Arthur.&#xD;
"I will be the first to see it !" exclaimed Carry, and as the&#xD;
turning was gained, she raised herself from the saddle. It was&#xD;
an unguarded moment ;-the horse circled the bend in a run;&#xD;
and she was thrown~ directly in the road of the trampling hoofs&#xD;
behind. Charley's horse fell back upon his haunches ;-~--~there&#xD;
was giant might in the hand that reigned 'him ;-.-an inch nearer,&#xD;
and ~he was 1o~t! for his fore .feet grazed her shoulder.&#xD;

"My dearest love I" cried the agitated Arthur, raising her in&#xD;
his arms. "Thank God! you are not 'killed !"&#xD;
"lam not hurt, dear Arthur! you are all so frightened I' it&#xD;
was very careless in me. Indeed I do not require support-I&#xD;
am not injured in the least I"&#xD;
"Are you sure ?" questioned Ida, anxiously: "or do. you say&#xD;
it for our sakes ?" .&#xD;
"I was never more free from pain. And I am able and ready&#xD;
to go on&#xD;
"You were her saviour 1" Arthur griped his brother's hand,&#xD;
with a trembling lip.&#xD;
"No thanks!, I would not run down a cow or sheep if I could&#xD;
help it."&#xD;
Arthur's even temper was tried by this speech, and the more,&#xD;
that it wounded Carry.&#xD;
oarse I 'un~eling I" thought Ida. She grudged him the&#xD;
eloq ent affection of Lynn's glance.' "I do not care to go fur-&#xD;
ther ;" said she, when Carry was reseated.&#xD;
" hat! turn back within sight of the' Promised Land ?" said&#xD;
Carr . "Do not cause me to feel that I have spoiled your after-&#xD;
noon s pleasure I Oscar and I will not part company again so&#xD;
unce emoniously,-will we, old fellow? Allons ?" and she shook&#xD;
the ems, gaily. The rest followed with ,reluctance, and for&#xD;
awhile, very soberly. The thought of what might have been&#xD;
the result of the accident, she treated so lightly, precluded jest,&#xD;
and they would not speak of it seriously. By tacit consent, it'&#xD;
was not referred to again. Lynn recovered himself first; he&#xD;
forgot everything but the fair domain they were entering; and&#xD;
his raptures awakened the others to its attractions. The house&#xD;
was a princely pile, rearing its towers from the midst of a finely-&#xD;
wooded park. The architecture was Gothic, and perfect in all&#xD;
its 'parts, even to the stained windows, imported, at '~n immense&#xD;
expense, from abroad. A village at the base of the hilb was&#xD;
peopled by the negroes, of whom there were more than an&#xD;
hundred connected with the plantation. The equestrians rode&#xD;
up the single street. Good humour and neatness characterized the&#xD;
simple inhabitants; children drew to one side of the road, with -&#xD;
smiles and courtesies; the aged raised their blared eyes, to reply'&#xD;
to the respectful salutations of the young riders; through the&#xD;

"I do not accept of that clause. They are happy!' They&#xD;
have a kind and generous master; every comfort in health;&#xD;
good nursing when ill; their church and' Bible, and their&#xD;
Saviour, who is also ours. What the race may become, I do not&#xD;
pretend to say. These are far in advance of the original stock;&#xD;
but their intellectual appetite is dull, and I dare affirm that in&#xD;
nine cases out of ten it is satisfied. I never knew a master who&#xD;
denied his servants permission to read, and many have them&#xD;
taught by their own children. The slave lies down at night,&#xD;
every want supplied, his family as well cared for~ as himself;&#xD;

"American as ever I" smiled Carry.&#xD;
"And Virginian as ever! The Old Dominion ismy mother!&#xD;

ties and foibles, to a dozen of the modern 'fast' belle states.&#xD;

obsolete ideas, but Heaven bless her! the heart is right and&#xD;

Ida's eyes sparkled-.-&#xD;
"'Where is the coward would not dare&#xD;
To die for such a land!'&#xD;
Is not this scenery English, Mr.' Holmes'? We seldom see so&#xD;
large a tract, under as high cultivation, in this quarter of the&#xD;

that ?"&#xD;

Arthur. "That will bring before you yet more vividly the&#xD;
'Homes of Merry ~ngland.'"&#xD;
"If an English landscape, it is an Italian light that gilds it,"&#xD;
replied Lynn. "The highlands upon the. other side of the river&#xD;
are Scottish; and the tropical growth of the tobacco fields would&#xD;
not be out of place under the Equator."&#xD;
"Shocking your gleanings, then, you return' to what Charley&#xD;
calls 'the original proposition,' and pronounce it American&#xD;
scenery," concluded Ai~thur.&#xD;
"Precisely. One need not go abroad in quest o(~atural&#xD;
beauties. The fairest are culled for his native land."&#xD;
"What a romantic creek! that is English I" exclaimed Ida.&#xD;
"I have 0-. P. R. James for authority; a rocky. ford; a steep&#xD;
bank on either side; tangled undergrowth-.-.and actually, a&#xD;
rustic foot-bridge! Oh!' for the solitary Borseman I"&#xD;
"There he is !" ejaculated Charley, and from the hazel-&#xD;
boughs emerged an old negro, mounted upon a shaggy donkey,&#xD;
a bag of corn behind him.&#xD;
"There is but a step, etc.," said Ida, despairingly. "It is&#xD;
my fate always to take it."&#xD;
With a hearty laugh, they wheeled their hor~es. Charley and&#xD;
Ida had the lead. Exhilarated by exercise and the scenes&#xD;
through which they had passed, and accustoi4ed to chat fami-&#xD;
liarly with him, sh~ ran on for some time' without remarking&#xD;
that she received mdnosyllabic replies.&#xD;
"You are tired," she observed.&#xD;
£C Not at all."&#xD;
"Out of humor, then 1"'&#xD;
"Do I look so&#xD;
"Not when you smile; ~but you are not making yourself&#xD;
agreeable."&#xD;
"I did not know that I had succeeded in doing so."&#xD;
"What! when Mr. Holmes says you are the only man who is&#xD;
never otherwise I"&#xD;
"He is partial. You can teach him better."'&#xD;
"The intimacy between you two mytifies me more and mbre.&#xD;

"No. That is most wonderful of all. I am not afraid of you&#xD;
all-though I have a cowardly horror of being laughed at."&#xD;
"A 'horror' yoi~ should overcome; it proceeds ~from vanity.&#xD;
Like most of us, you are not apt to do or say things which you&#xD;
consider particularly silly~; and are offended that the public sees&#xD;
them in that light. Lynn is afflicted similarly, in a still greater&#xD;
degree. It will get him into trouble yet."&#xD;
"He is too independent to vacillate on account of ridicule,"&#xD;
said Ida.&#xD;
"Men style the peevish resentmentt such dispositions exhibit,&#xD;
'Aonor,"' returned Charley, with a half bitter emphasis. "It&#xD;
is one of the million misnomers with which they deceive them-&#xD;
selves."&#xD;
"Among the number I may place my mistaking conceit for&#xD;
sensibility ?"&#xD;
"And concealment of one's feelings for insensibility," he&#xD;
added.&#xD;
"You misunderstood me, Mr. Dana. I do not think you&#xD;
have a heart of adamant-"&#xD;
"But that I have none," he interrupted; his kind glance&#xD;
blunting the edge of hi~ words. "We shall understand each&#xD;
other better by and by. You spoke of James a while ago; do&#xD;
you like him ?"&#xD;
"No; He has two defects which spoil everything he writes,&#xD;
at least to me-verbosity and affectation."&#xD;
"Not to mention self-plagiarism; but that is a common fault.&#xD;
When an author has exhausted his capital, he had better sus-&#xD;
pend honorably and wait until he has funds in hands to recoin-.&#xD;
mence. operations, than drag on, 'shinning it,' in mercan~ti4~~&#xD;
phrase, until the reading world dishonors his notes. Instead of&#xD;
this, James, and a score more of our popular writers are palming&#xD;
off upon i~s, duplicates and re-duplicates of their earliest produc..&#xD;
t~on~. We encounter continually some old acquaintance in a&#xD;
different attire, and under an 'alias.' Warmed.over dinners are&#xD;
good enough in their placc, but when we pay the same price, we&#xD;
have a right to be dainty. Dickens, himself, is not free from&#xD;
this charge.''&#xD;
"Oh! do not say so! I will not hear a word against him.&#xD;
tEe says much that seems irrelevant, and occasionally a thing&#xD;
&#xD;
that is provokingly absurd; but it is grand to see how, in the&#xD;
denouement, he catches up these floating, apparently useless&#xD;
threads, and weaves them into the fabric. He works with less&#xD;
waste tha~n any light author of the day; all is smooth and firm;&#xD;
no ragged edges. or dropped stitches. And if his charming crea-&#xD;
tions are set before us more than once, they can well bear k&#xD;
renewal of acquaintanceship.~~&#xD;
"But not in a disguise which is less becoming than the dress&#xD;
in which we first knew them. When we cr~ 'encore,' we ask&#xD;
for a repetition, not an imitation-too often a burlesque."&#xD;
* "But," persisted Ida, warxm in defence of her favorite ]loz,&#xD;
"wh~re shall we discover ~iew phases of human nature? 'The&#xD;
fault is that so many men are copies of others; we must not&#xD;
censure the painter for lack of originality, who writes above his&#xD;
sketches, 'taken from life.' Who ever reads a new love story?&#xD;
and love is not the only passion which is the same~ the world&#xD;
over."&#xD;
Charley leaned forward to brusl~ a fly from his horse's ear.&#xD;
"Are there no peculiarities in your lot ?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Perhaps so," she replied, startled by the hoine~thrust.&#xD;
"Your character is not the reflected image of another's; you&#xD;
have~never seen one who felt, thought, and acted exactly as you&#xD;
do; or who would have been your prototype, had your outward&#xD;
circumstances been alike. The Great Original is not a servile&#xD;
copyist."&#xD;

the knoll-the solitary bright spot in the landscape&amp;amp; They went&#xD;
rapidly by; but Ida was grateful that his recollection of it should&#xD;
be linked with that fragrant eve, and gleaming farewell smile.&#xD;
"It is singular that in our rides we should not have taken&#xD;
this road before," said Charley. "It is, just here, a mere bridle&#xD;
path, but I thought we had scoured the country."&#xD;
"Did you know Mr. Holmes, when. he lived there ?"&#xD;
"No. He was fourteen years old when we met at school."&#xD;
"The homestead is a pitiable wreck," continued Ida. 'A&#xD;
lonely tree and a desolated hearth 1', he said. Those mournful&#xD;
words will haunt me."&#xD;

It was Art., in as hot haste as when he set out. 'What is to&#xD;
pay?' said I, as he came in. 'Forgotten any thing-or iB the&#xD;
woman dead?'&#xD;
"'Confound her!'&#xD;
"I knew he must be pretty 'tall' to say that.&#xD;
"'Never be a doctor, Charley.'&#xD;
"' I wont, my dear boy; but what is the matter?'&#xD;
"'Why nothing~. just nothing!' beginning to laugh. 'I&#xD;
galloped two miles like a race-rider, and ran into the house,&#xD;
expecting a scene of distress-perhaps of death. 'Mrs. Jeemes'&#xD;
was sitting up, rocking herself back and forth. I felt her pulse&#xD;
and inquired her symptoms.'&#xD;
"'You see,' stuttered Stiger, 'she's been sort o' poorly and&#xD;
droopy for three weeks, and better. I've been lettingg to go for&#xD;
you, but thought maybe she bought be able to pick up after'&#xD;
awhile. To-night I was so hungry myself that I didn't notice&#xD;
her at supper. She was mighty poking all the evening , and jest&#xD;
now, she waked me. 'Jeemes,' says she, 'when folks' appetites&#xD;
gives out, they dies-don't they?'&#xD;
"'Yes, honey,' says I.&#xD;
"'Then farewell,' says she; 'I'm a-goin'. I wouldn't say&#xD;

"'Doctor! you think she'll live 'till day? Oh! if I had~&#xD;

Sad as were the feelings of the little company, they smiled at&#xD;
his tone and action.&#xD;
"Hush, Charley! I am petitioning Ida for a song," said&#xD;
Carry. "One of your own, my dear. We like no other so&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
" r~ very lonely now, Carry! and weary, and wakeful and&#xD;
home-sick. You and your home have spoiled me; my heart has&#xD;
been enlarged, only to aggravate the cdd empty feeling; you&#xD;
have disabled me for the life I must lead here. 'iDiscouraged&#xD;
already!' I hear you say. ' Did you not promise to be good and&#xD;
patient?' I am not likg~ you, I cannot love,.unless I am~beloved;&#xD;

Our journey was pleasant. The children behaVed ~ merv~ille;&#xD;
your sister was-as she always is-tender and motherly, (you&#xD;
know what that last means from me!) and the conduct of our&#xD;
gallant outriders was above praise. Leaving Mrs. Dana. at her&#xD;
door, Lynn and Charley escorted me up-town. With their&#xD;
'good nights,' and promises to see me again soon, connection&#xD;
with Poplar-grove was severed. My former self-.-I told you&#xD;
how it would be !-was waiting for me inside the hall-door. I&#xD;
was as little changed in the eyes of Mr. Read and his daughter,&#xD;
as they were in mine. The first-named was upon his etiquette&#xD;
stilts ~ and Josephine's fingers, as I touched them, were as limp&#xD;
and warm as the digits of a frozen frog. (Vide Charley.) I&#xD;
rememkered.yo~i and my promise, and made a tremendous effort.&#xD;
'You are looking so well, that I will not inquire whether your&#xD;
trip was as delightful as you anticipated;' to the daughter.&#xD;
"'We spent~ our time agreeably;' dryly~&#xD;
"'Were the waters of Saratoga beneficial to you, sir?' to the&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"'My health required no improvement;' stiffly, and with a&#xD;

will ever remain antagonistic ;--not. that I am quarrelsome; I&#xD;
detest strife. I am sick of this eternal sparring and heart-.&#xD;
burpiing; but I am no dissembler; and I foresee many contests;&#xD;
perhaps as many defeats, ?or cool audacity is more than 'a match&#xD;
for hot blood like .mine. Our characters will come into play&#xD;
upon a wider stage than heretofore, and should we close in com-&#xD;
bat there, the struggle will be fearful. I am willing,-thanks&#xD;
to you !-to sacrifice prejudice,-not principle or self-respect.&#xD;
Three long, dreary months before I. can hope to see you! I&#xD;
fear to think how wicked, I may become in that time. Rich-&#xD;
mond is, to me, a Sahara, whose single fountain of sweet waters&#xD;
springs up within your sister's home. Those, who, within a few&#xD;
months, were unknown, are nearer-than acquaintances of years'&#xD;
standing. Poor Rachel stands by, waiting to undress me, her&#xD;
~face as long as' mine. 'Ah! Miss Ida! this ain't Dr. Carleton's!'&#xD;
She does not realise how painfully conscious I am of that fact.&#xD;
I can hardly say why I have written this incoherent note;&#xD;
except, that I am dispirited, and thirst to talk to you. Forgive&#xD;
my unhappy egotism ! I cannot ask you to respond to emotions&#xD;
which never swell your gentle bosom. To your best of fathers,&#xD;
present my warmest regards. I owe him a debt I cannot repay.&#xD;
And to him, dear Carry, whose image blends with yours, in my&#xD;
dreams of the futizre; the only man I know, to whom I could&#xD;
willingly resign you, give a sister's love. The strongest proof&#xD;
of my affection is, that I am not jealous. Good night ! and a&#xD;
blessing, my dearest! If your rest will be the sweeter for know-,&#xD;
ing that to another, than Aim, you make life lovely, believe it!&#xD;
As ever, yours,&#xD;
IDA."&#xD;
" I saw Mr. tcy upon the street, to-day," remarked Mr..&#xD;
Read, the next ev ning at supper.&#xD;
h'"Ah I" said Josephine, delightedly. " Did you speak with&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
" Yes;'he stopped me to apologise for having delayed calling,&#xD;
until this time. lie is studying law with Mr. Li., and has little&#xD;
leisure for visiting-so he. says."&#xD;
" Did you inquire after his sister's health ?"&#xD;
"No. 'You had better do so, if. he calls this evening. He&#xD;
,asked whether y u would be at home."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Josephine coloured with pleasure; and Ida was curious to see&#xD;
one who had inspired them with such respect and admiration;&#xD;
for through 'Mr. Read's assumed carelessness, it was easy to&#xD;
discover that he was flattered by the promised visit... She&#xD;
gathered from their conversation that they had met Mr. Lacy&#xD;
at the Springs, whither he had gone with an invalid sister. As&#xD;
Virginians, they attached themselves to the Read party,-"tke&#xD;
party of the season," so Josephine unblushingly asserted.&#xD;
Too proud to go into the drawing-room, without an invitation,&#xD;
Ida went to her chamber, to spend the hours between supper and&#xD;
bed-time, in reading.&#xD;
" Miss Josephine irpust 'spect her beau; she's mightily fined&#xD;
o,"commented Rachel, when she came up from her meal. "I&#xD;
said so! thar's the door-bell! Ain't you going down, Mish&#xD;
Ida ?"&#xD;
-"aNo;"-not withdrawing her eyes from her book.&#xD;
a"You aint a school-girl now, Miss 'Ida," Rachael remon-&#xD;
strated.&#xD;
" Well-and if I am not ?"&#xD;
" Why, young ladies ought to see company. 'I can't bear for&#xD;
you to be hiding up here, just like you was an ediot orrerformed;&#xD;
and Miss Josephine, who aint nigh so pretty, nor good, for that&#xD;
matter, is stealing all the beaux."&#xD;
" In other words, my good Rachel, you want me to get&#xD;
married."&#xD;
" Yes ma'am," said Raohel boldly; " If you come across any&#xD;
body to .suit you, I'd a heap rather you'd be his. wife, than to&#xD;
stay here to be pecked at and worried."&#xD;
" I am not easily .worried ; I am my own mistress, 'and&#xD;
restrained by no one."~&#xD;
" Your own mistis'; Miss Ida ! Don't .I see you. sittin' at&#xD;
table, and in the parlor, never opening your mouth to say&#xD;
nothin'; and aint you cooped up here in this chamber, because'&#xD;
Miss Josephine aint got politeness enough to ask you down?&#xD;
. and'after they've been making as much of you at Dr. Carleton's&#xD;
as if you had been the Queen of Sheby ! .Miss Carry is a lady&#xD;
worth talking about, and so is Miss Jenny-none of your turned&#xD;

&#xD;
Ida read on in silence.&#xD;
'~ The bell agin I" muttered Rachel, fretfully. I don't know&#xD;
what they're coming for. If they kn~wed as much as we ser-&#xD;
vants, they'd as soon jam their finger~ into' a steel-trap. What&#xD;
do you want ?". she said, snappishly to the footman who knocked&#xD;
at the door.&#xD;
"Two gentlemen to see Miss Rc~ss-Mr. Dana and Mr.&#xD;
Holmes."&#xD;
"I'll tell her ;" she returned, greatly modified. 'C Now, Miss&#xD;
Ida, don't scare them off with no solemn looks and talk. Do&#xD;
just like you did at Miss Carry's; and 'bove all things, don't&#xD;
let Miss Josephine cut you out I"&#xD;
We trust to the reader's good-nature to excuse the unfair use&#xD;
which Rachel made of the back parlor window. . The affection-&#xD;
ate curiosity that prompted her to "peep at Miss Ida, as she&#xD;
made her manners," was gratified by seeing her receive her visi-&#xD;
tors with as much affability, as if Carry, instead of 'Miss Read,&#xD;
were present. As Rachel surmised, the latter had a beau; and&#xD;
~     Ida's hasty survey excited a feeling of surprise. He looked and&#xD;
moved the gentleman; but although he arose with the others,&#xD;
and 'remained standing, Josephine did not introduce him.&#xD;
~Charley's presence of mind prevented embarrassment.&#xD;
"I beg pardon, Morton; I thought you knew Miss Ross-&#xD;
Miss Ida, my friend, Mr. Lacy."&#xD;
This assumption of the duties of host at first cull would have&#xD;
been inexcusable in most cases. Josephine understood it, as it&#xD;
wa~meant, as a severe rebuke for her negligence or ill-breeding.&#xD;
The "my friend," too, nettled her. Mr. Lacy had presented&#xD;
the gentlemen to her when they came in, and had spoken to&#xD;
Charley as an old acquaintance, but what right had this stranger&#xD;
to insinuate, that, as his friend, Ida had a title to her "pro-&#xD;
perty ?" She almost forgave him, however, when she found that,&#xD;
for the present, he was n~t disposed to push his advantage. He&#xD;
left her to the most delightful t~te-?t-t~te; turned his back quite&#xD;
upon her, and addressed himself to Id~. She would have&#xD;
pocl~eted a dozen insults an evening to sit upon the same sofa with&#xD;
Morton Lacy, to read devotion in 'his speaking eyes, and hear&#xD;
Jove's music in every cadence of his voice. She was in Elysium'&#xD;
-with but one drawback upon her felicity. The group across&#xD;

catch the words that melted like honey-dew upon her lips; and&#xD;
herself-with falling lids, as though she feared he might see more&#xD;
in the modest eyes than maiden coyness would have him know-.&#xD;
they must notice them, and seeing, Ida must be expiring with&#xD;
envy, and the gentlemen regret, ~while they envied, that they&#xD;
were too late to compete for the prize. It is not often that the&#xD;
truth is as sweet as the darling fictions we dream to ourselves,&#xD;
and on this occasion, assuredly, the reality would have rendered&#xD;
wormwood palatable in comparison; for the trio of frien~Th were&#xD;
unaffectedly engrossed with each other, and stupidly ignorant of&#xD;
the ~duett played near them.&#xD;
"Jenny sent her love to you," said Charley; "she will call&#xD;
shortly. 'She complains of being tired out with The labor of rec-&#xD;
tifying the disorders of John's bachelor establishment. She&#xD;
treated us, ~t tea, to a summary of his domestic economy.&#xD;
Half of the time, he forgot to go to market, and wondered at&#xD;
the want of var~ty in the fare. ' The cook was consulted, and&#xD;
hinted at the cause. The ensuing day, he laid in provisions for&#xD;
a week, particularly of such commodities as frugal housewives&#xD;
do not care to hiwe on hand in hot weather.. He bought a pair&#xD;
of parlor lamps. 'You~ wished to surprise me' by this handsome&#xD;
present, I suppose,' said Jenny.&#xD;
"'Why no-I should not have purchased them if the old&#xD;
ones had not been worn out,' said he.&#xD;
"'Worn out! when we have not had them six month~!'~&#xD;
CCC Yes!' answered he, positively. 'They would not burn-&#xD;
went out, as fast as I lighted them; and worse than that, the&#xD;

"'Very odd!' said Jenny, unscrewing one~ of the lamps~&#xD;

regularly?'                  I&#xD;
"'Never thought of it once!' exclaimed John, foolishly.&#xD;
"See how useless marrying makes a man!&#xD;
"Rather, how comfortless he is without a wife ;" responded&#xD;
Ida. "As respects order and management in household mat-&#xD;

the Tartars."&#xD;

"Say on a par with the iottentots, and you will be never&#xD;
the truth ;" said Lynn. "Nothing caw be well-done that~is&#xD;
unnatural. Not one man in a hundred has a takut for house-&#xD;
keeping; some acquire a smattering of the science, and make&#xD;
themselves ridiculous by an offensive display of it. Their wives&#xD;
should rig them in kitchen aprons, set them to rolling out pie-&#xD;
crust, and officiate as their substitutes in tl~e shop, office, or&#xD;
counting-room. There is a loud hue and cry after 'strong.&#xD;
minded womew;' who says any thing about weak-minded men?"&#xD;
"You do not coi~sider that the feebler intellect belongs of&#xD;
necessity, to the feebler body, do you ?" asked Charley.&#xD;
"Not I! Do away ~with this absurd antipathy to clever&#xD;
women; give them our advantages of education, and they will&#xD;
outshine us mentally, as they do morally. The mind of a woman&#xD;
is a wonderful thing; like the scimetai~ of Saladin, it cuts&#xD;
through, at a single stroke what our clumsy blades have hacked&#xD;
at in vain. I~ight, graceful, delicate-it does not lack power&#xD;
because it has beauty."&#xD;
"It is very pleasant to listen to agreeable speeches, even&#xD;
when we know them to be flattery," said Ida; "I acquit you of&#xD;
insincerity, Mr. Holmes-I perceive t~iat Mr. Dana sides with&#xD;
you-but permit me to say, that I k~ow more of the mental&#xD;
calibre of my sex than either of you. To a certain point, we&#xD;
~an rival you successfully-like the hare and tortoise-we run&#xD;
well for a time, and laugh at your plodding; but we have not&#xD;
the taste or ability to bear you company to the goal. As well&#xD;

of the eagle. We cannot reason-~--we are persuaded because we&#xD;
fees that a truth &amp;amp;xists-for our lives, we could not tell you why&#xD;

"And this is an argument to establish your inferiority !"&#xD;
exclaimed Lynn. "Where is the use of reasoning? I would&#xD;
trust a true woman's intuition in preference to all the systems&#xD;
of logic and induction, the blundering, lumbering brain of man&#xD;
has built. Do not depreciate this angelic faculty, Miss Ida; you&#xD;
held it in common with higher intelligences"&#xD;
"Yes !-I doubt if Gabriel bothers his head with syllogisms 6r&#xD;
logarithms," said Charley. "Two to onc-.Mi~s Ida-giveiip!".&#xD;
"Men are inconsistent creatures," said she. "They will have&#xD;
&#xD;
it we are their superiors,-exhaust dictionaries and. their imagi-&#xD;
nations to load us with exalted epithets; and behave, as though&#xD;
we were children, to be coaxed with sugar-plums. An angel in&#xD;
theory, the corporeal woman is soundly rated if dinner is late,&#xD;
or a room unswept. We are 'akin to higher inteUigences,'-&#xD;
but let one presume to measure lances with a lord of creation in&#xD;
a conflict of minds, and how quickly is she assailed by the hoots&#xD;
of her professed adorers! You will allege that she has stepped&#xD;
out of her sphere. Granted-but according to your belief, she&#xD;
has stooped to your level, and you should be grateful for the&#xD;
grace. us it so? 'The ladith are' divine, tho long ath they&#xD;

the dandy whose organs of speech serve to distinguish him from&#xD;
a marmoset;-and wise doctors of law and medicine and divinity,&#xD;
read us homilies upon the modesty, the humility, the submis-&#xD;
siveness of the softer sex, and recommend St. Paul to our dili-&#xD;
gent perusal. We are not cherubim,-nor yet slaves;-not your&#xD;
superiors; and in mind are far from being your equals;. but we&#xD;
do hold that we are, or ought to be qualified for your companions;&#xD;

"And their invincible obstinacy," returned Charley. "That&#xD;
is not just the word-it is a certain never-give-up-able-ness,&#xD;
vexatiously delightful, which precipitates one into a rage and&#xD;
love, at the same time-he is divided between hi~ disposition to&#xD;

"No-an authentic narrative. 'A tailor having amassed.' a&#xD;
fortune by his trade, cut the shop and removed to the country,&#xD;
to live in dignified leisure. His wife was a bit of a shrew, and&#xD;
apt, as all wifes are,-to find out her husband's weak points.&#xD;
One of these was a shame of his former occupation, and she&#xD;
harped uponiJie jarring string, until the poor wretch was nearly&#xD;
beside himself. Her touch-word, 'scissors,' spoiled his finest&#xD;
bon mots, and embittered his grandest entertainment-it was&#xD;
flame to tow. He stormed and wheedled, threatened and bribed*&#xD;
the obnoxious instrument was constantly brandished before his&#xD;

"Very probable, my dear,-it reminds one so much of an&#xD;
open pair of scissors!'&#xD;
"One p~ish-and she was struggling in the water.&#xD;
"'I will~pull you nut, if you promise never to say that word&#xD;
again!' hal~Loed the still foaming husband.&#xD;
"'Sciss6rs!' screeched she, and down she went.&#xD;
"'Scissors 1' as she arose again. The third time, she came&#xD;
to the surface, too far gone to speak-but as the waters closed&#xD;
over her, she threw up her arms, crossing her fore fingers-thus&#xD;
and disappeared."&#xD;
Jda laughed-~--her rieh, musical laugh, which awoke strange&#xD;
echoes in, those formal rooms. Mr. Read's portrait frowned down&#xD;
from its niche, and Josephine raised her brows with an air of&#xD;
astonishment, which would have been contempt, had she not&#xD;
been upon the amiable at the time. Another started too, but&#xD;
with a different expression. Few who saw Morton Lacy smile,&#xD;
forgot it. It was not a superficial illumination, but a flashing&#xD;
through of an inward 'light, as might play upon the surface of a,&#xD;
gem-bedded stream, could the sun strike upon its concealed&#xD;
wealth.&#xD;
"We seldom hear a Bound like that, in this age of affectation ;"&#xD;
said he, to Josephine.&#xD;
"~She will learn better;" she replied. 9 She is just from her&#xD;
&#xD;
books, and rather eccentric in some of her ways and notions. I&#xD;
rally her daily upon her little oddities, but she is wilful, a~&#xD;
spoiled children will be,-and being older, and 'more clever than&#xD;
myself, out-argues me. The main point of disagreement is that&#xD;
she is fond of liberty of speech and action, declares Die Vernon&#xD;
her beau ideal of a woman, and I am prudish in my reserve."&#xD;
"Not prudish-feminine 1" he answered, emphatioMly. "Is&#xD;
she a relative ?"&#xD;
"No: a ward ~of my father's."&#xD;
"An QEphan !" with a remorseful pity, 'for which Josephine&#xD;
could have blasted Ida as she sat.&#xD;
"She does not feel her situation so keenly as a sensitive person&#xD;
would. , Those are happiest whose wounds heal soonest,-to&#xD;
whom a life-time of grief is unknown. I am thankful that Ida's&#xD;
temperament is mercurial-she is spared much suffering ;" and&#xD;
her voice trembled admirably, as she lifted her eyes to a portrait&#xD;
above the mantel. Another adroi1~ hit! the base brought out&#xD;
the ring of the genuine metal.&#xD;
"There are, indeed, losses, whi~h, in 'an earthly sense, are&#xD;
irreparable, and although I know nothing personally of such a&#xD;
bereavement, I can understand th4t the shadow of a mother's&#xD;
tomb grows darker and longer, as tl~e child 'walks on in the path&#xD;
her care would have smoothed."&#xD;
'"Especially to an orphaned girl; each day has wants and&#xD;
exigencies she had not thought of before. Yet who knows the&#xD;
pains of her lot ?" said, Josephine, sighing.&#xD;
"'Few are the h4arts whence one same touch,&#xD;
Bids the sweet~ fountains flow!"'&#xD;
repeated Mr. Lacy. "Have you learned that song, according&#xD;
to promise ?"&#xD;
"I always keep my promises."&#xD;
"May I demand the proof that this one was remembered."&#xD;
The 'piece in question lay suspiciously near the top of the&#xD;
portfolio, although she protested that she had "only played it&#xD;
over once, and a fortnight ago."&#xD;
"It is set as a duett; will not your friend sing with you ?"&#xD;
"I don't know;" shaking her head, smilingly. "She is chary&#xD;
of her favors-all good singers are. Perhaps she will not refuse&#xD;

Thus importuned, Mr. Lacy went up to Ida, and preferred his&#xD;
request.&#xD;
"]~xcuse me, sir, I am not familiar with the music ;" said&#xD;
she, surprised that Josephine had dispatched him upon such an&#xD;
embassy, when her jealousy' of Ida's superiority as a vocalist,&#xD;
had been the cause of innumerable slights and petty meannesses&#xD;
~from herself and father.&#xD;
"'Now! be obliging, Ida !" she interposed, "you sing at sight&#xD;
better than I do, after a year's practising."&#xD;
"I am sorry to appear disobliging, Mr. Lacy;" pursued Ida;&#xD;
and she spoke sincerely, as she met his smile; "but you would&#xD;
not thank' me for ruining your song."&#xD;
"Oh! how can you~ say so 1" claimedd Josephine. "Mr.&#xD;
Dermott call you a second Malibran'; or was it Sappho ?"&#xD;
To Mr. Lacy, this was coaxingly playful; but the fiery spot&#xD;
came to Ida's cheek, at words, which had been piped over, and&#xD;
distorted, until malice itself must be weary of repeating them.&#xD;
"I beg you to consider my refusal as final and positive ;" she&#xD;
said, haughtily. Mr. Lacy bowed, with dignity, and returned&#xD;
Josephine.&#xD;
"Am I, a'ls'o, to be refused ?" asked Lynn, as Josephine&#xD;
picked out a third song. "You will not ' suspect me of empty&#xD;
compliments."&#xD;
"Not 'for' you, will I sing now and kere!" said Ida. "Be&#xD;
sure I have my reasons for objecting to give you pleasure."&#xD;
"Be quiet, Linn! she means what she says ;" interrupted&#xD;
Charley, as his friend persisted. Lynn obeyed, but his black&#xD;
eyes went from the face of the speaker, to Ida's compressed lips,&#xD;
until they darted an angry light upon Josephine, showing that&#xD;
he had an inkling of the truth.&#xD;
"This is the beginning!" said Id 4, as she knelt at her window&#xD;
to gain tranquillity from 'the ~cool'an4 stillness of the night. The&#xD;
moon neared the horizon; the roof-t~ps contrasted brightly with&#xD;
the shade of the street; and one Jk~fty spire pointed a snowy&#xD;
finger upward, the golden trumpet upon its taper extremity&#xD;
silvered 'by its pale rays. It was a "sweet south" that bore up&#xD;
the lullaby our beautiful river sings nightly to our myriads of&#xD;
sleeping children; but as the girl gazed and listened, inquietude,&#xD;
instead of peace, had~ possession of her-the nameless longing&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
that makes mortals weep and strive, and die! that burning&#xD;
craving for something-they canuo~t tell what-except that&#xD;
earth does not bestow it, and the spirit will not rest without it.&#xD;
It may be, angel-teachers are with us, awakening a desire for,&#xD;
rather than imparting knowledge, which is their food, and can&#xD;
alone satisfy our immortal minds-or our young souls are flut-&#xD;
tering their unfledged wings, restless for the flight, instinct&#xD;
tell~ them is before them-we know not-only that the thirst&#xD;
is fierce-.-maddening! and there is but one. fountain which&#xD;
quenches it. The river's song should have summoned up the&#xD;
vision of those living waters, and their wooing, "Let him that&#xD;
is athirst come !" and the white spire-had its silent gesture no&#xD;
significance?&#xD;
Jda'~ thoughts did not rise. A painful truth had that night&#xD;
obtruded itself upon' her, that the love of those she esteemed&#xD;
most, had not strengthened her to bear the trials incident to&#xD;
her position. With Carry at her side, to defend and console,&#xD;
many a shaft would have fallen harmless, perchance, unre-&#xD;
marked; in her absence, the certainty of her affection did&#xD;
not render Josephine's malevolence innocuous, or her society&#xD;
endurable.&#xD;
"I was not born for this life! I do not breathing the pent-&#xD;
house in which they would immure my soul. I cannot escape!&#xD;
I am virtually a prisoner in body and spirit-with energies,&#xD;
which must not act-affections, which must not flow! I thirst&#xD;
for liberty and love !"&#xD;
'Lower and lower dipped the moon-and higher mounted the&#xD;
shade upon the steeple-the golden 'trumpet was glistenless as&#xD;
the rest, and the stars only kept gi~ard over the slumbering city,&#xD;
and the watcher knelt still-dreaming now love-dreams of appre-&#xD;
ciation and devotion-trances, almost realities in their passionate&#xD;
idealization; and then, as they closed by their very sweetness-"&#xD;
or the real and the present would burst upon her, crying in&#xD;
anguished accents, "I thirst !"&#xD;

JOSEPINE READ gave a party--her first, and the first of&#xD;
the season; an onerous undertaking for a young, and compara.-&#xD;
tively inexperienced house-keeper; but she went about it bravely&#xD;
and confidently. She did not overrate her capacity; if she had a&#xD;
talent for anything, it was for housewifery-" driving" included.&#xD;
If her domestic machinery did not work well, it was not for lack&#xD;
of scolding; and, it was ruinored, not because more stringent&#xD;
measures were not employed by her own. fair hands.&#xD;
" Miss Josephine flies "about the kitchen like a pea 'pon a hot&#xD;
shovel ;" said Rachel, the day before that for which the rest of&#xD;
the week was made. " It's 'sprising how much spring she's got&#xD;
in that little body of hern, and how much spite too, if you'll&#xD;
'low me to say it, Miss Ida."                    -     -&#xD;
" I certainly shall not," said Ida, severely. " I do not care&#xD;
to hear your remarks upon her now, or at~ any time. They are&#xD;
neither respectful or becoming."&#xD;
" Law! Miss Ida ! you know Miss Josephine as well as I do;&#xD;
what harmn does my talking do ? I was-goin' to tell you, that I&#xD;
thought I should a' died laughin' to see how mad she was, when&#xD;
Joe dropped the big cake she sent to the confectionaries to have&#xD;
iced. Hei- face turned red as them curtains, and soon as she&#xD;
could move, she pulled off her' shoe, and gave him such a lick&#xD;
'pon the side of his head, I'll bound he -seed stars"&#xD;
" Are your preparations concluded ?" asked Mr. Read, that&#xD;
night. .&#xD;
" I believe so, sir."&#xD;
.u 'You believe so!' why can't you give a direct answer? I&#xD;
hate this mincing you women think so pretty. Are you ready I"&#xD;
" The :table is not set," said Josephine, provokingly, " and&#xD;
the jellies and creanis are -not turned into the dishes yet." .&#xD;
" What will this tomfoolery cost ?" barked her father.&#xD;
u"I don't know, sir-what other people's parties do."  .&#xD;
"You are wonderfully independent, young woman ! you intend&#xD;
to foot the bills I hope."&#xD;

&#xD;
No answer, except a bar of a popular air, hummed, while&#xD;
trying on a head-dress.&#xD;
" Whom have you invited ?"&#xD;
" There is the list-you can read it."&#xD;
He looked at it surlily. " How many rooms do you open ?"&#xD;
" The parlors and dining room ;-unless you prefer to have&#xD;
the dressing-roomis in the third story, and give up your chamber&#xD;
to the dancers.~&#xD;
" Have the goodness to leave me out -of the scrape. I shall&#xD;
go to bed directly after supper. You two may do your husband&#xD;
hunting without my help. I pity the man who gets either of&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Since you are so much opposed to this party, I will recall&#xD;
imy invitations to-morrow morning," retorted Josephine, iri-itated&#xD;
by his peevish vulgarity, to take a high stand herself.&#xD;
" You will not, Miss! Carry out what you have commenced&#xD;
-much joy may you have of it !"&#xD;
What pleasure or benefit could arise from this snarling con-&#xD;
tradiction, would have defied a wiser brain than Ida's to deter-&#xD;
mine. She once imagined it a part of Mr. Read's schooling ;&#xD;
that he sought to inure his pupil to the treatment she would&#xD;
receive from the world; but this impression was corrected by&#xD;
observing that the effrontery he had taught her angered him&#xD;
beyond measure, when exhibited towards himself. =Variance&#xD;
appeared to be necessary to their existence; a safety-valve for&#xD;
the ill humors they could not throw out upon others. It was a&#xD;
curious fact that their going into company, at home or abroad,&#xD;
was invaribly preceded by this moral phlebotomizing, and in&#xD;
proportion to the extent of the depletion, was the subsequent&#xD;
affability., It was therefore to be expected that they should&#xD;
appear in the drawing-room on the evening of the party, looking&#xD;
their best ;-she, deferentially respectful to "Papa," and he,&#xD;
marking " my daughter, sir's," motions with paternal pride. A&#xD;
large party usually belongs to one 'of two classes--the stiffly&#xD;
regular, or the noisily irregular. At the former, there is eon-&#xD;
siderably less sociability and, ease than is prevalent among ,a&#xD;
corps of .raw recruits upon parade, under the eye. of a martinet&#xD;
drilled serjeant. As many as' can obtain seats, seize them; a&#xD;

at a premium, a bouquet is a godsend ;-the pulling off and on&#xD;
of the first, and the criticism of the later, are engrossing subjects&#xD;
of reflection and entertainment. There are knots of men in the&#xD;
entry, and in the corners, and behind doors; and rows of kdies&#xD;
against the wall, and ~stretched out transversely and longitudi~ally&#xD;
through the room. Supper over, watches are slyly consulted,&#xD;
yawns dexterously swallowed, and presently the crowd is thur~ner,&#xD;
though no one goes. Then come whispered adeaux ;-" so sorry&#xD;
to' quit your charming party at this early hoiir,-but papa&#xD;
charged me to be home by twelve, and he is so particular ;" and&#xD;
"my dear Mrs. Heavyaslead, I must tear myself away-mamma&#xD;
was not well to-night; I am quite uneasy about her ;"-and&#xD;
there are headaches and sid~aches, and toothaches, until the&#xD;

carefully trained the confirmed wall-flowers, seats are voted in&#xD;
the way ;-each joke is capital ;-4ach laugh a scream. Girls&#xD;
rattle and coquet, and gentlemen bow and flatter; you stumble&#xD;
upon a flirtation at every step, and cannot tread upon a boot or&#xD;
corn, without cutting a gallant speech in the middle; time pieces&#xD;
are put back two or three hours, and ostentatiously showed&#xD;
around, to prove that there is time enough yet." Morning&#xD;
breaks, ere the revellers unwillingly depart, and Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
-Cricketspry hear, for six-months after, of the "splendid time we&#xD;
had at your party."&#xD;
Miss Read's soiree promised to be of the first-named order.-&#xD;
A large proportion of her guests were strangers to each other,&#xD;
and she had not the tact to amalgamate the mixture. A hostess&#xD;
must be impartial; the safest course is to ignore the object of&#xD;
her preference, even at th&amp;amp;risk of being misunderstood; better&#xD;
offend one, than an hundred. Josephine made no such heroic&#xD;
sacrifice. She had invited Mr. Lacy; the rest were there to&#xD;
see, and they were not backward to discern this. She had twice&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
137&#xD;
&#xD;
made the circuit of the rooms upon his arm, and stood for half&#xD;
an hour between the folding-doors, in conversation, that, so far&#xD;
as her efforts went, was confidential, when her father touched&#xD;
her shoulder. '~ Are we to have no dancing, Josey ?"&#xD;
"If my friends desire it-certainly! Mr. Pemberton"-as&#xD;
that individual frisked by,-" IDo me the favor to act as master&#xD;
of ceremonies, and form a set."&#xD;
"With pleasure, Miss Josephine, provided I am honored by&#xD;
your hand-for the dance-I mean ;" tickled to excess by liis&#xD;
witty clause.&#xD;
The hateful puppy! but there was no retreat. Had Mr. Lacy&#xD;
been out of earshot, she would have pleaded an engagement, so&#xD;
certain was she that he would ask'her, but she could not utter so&#xD;
palpable a falsehood in his hearing. She did hope that lie would&#xD;
interfere, and with the inimitable self-possession which distin-&#xD;
guished him, open an avenue of escape by implying, if not'&#xD;
asserting his right of priority; but he was silent, and she yielded&#xD;
an ungracious assent. Mr. Pemberton was a boasted adept in&#xD;
the art of "cutting out"-a system of counter-plotting, too yvell&#xD;
understood to need explanation here; and as he bustled around,&#xD;
officious and fussy, he circulated, as the latest and best joke," an&#xD;
account of his cunning in "heading 6ff that 'chap, Lacy."&#xD;
"Are you fond of. this amusement ?" inquired the latter of&#xD;
Josephine.&#xD;
"Passionately I" said she, brightening up at this, as- she&#xD;
thought, prefatory remark. The next was still more promising.&#xD;
"You will not stop at a single set then ?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! I often keep the floor for hours. It is a health-&#xD;
ful and innocent exercise. I had rather dance than spend the&#xD;
evening in gossiping after the fashion of the strait-laced sort,&#xD;
who are conscientiously opposed to "wordly follies.~~~&#xD;
Mr. Lacy smiled, a little queerly. It was evident that he&#xD;
agreed with her, in her estimate of these over-scrupulous wor-&#xD;
thies. Still, the coveted request did not arrive, and she tossed&#xD;
out a desperate feeler.&#xD;
"You do not think it undignified to dance, do you ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps if I were to state why I never participate in the&#xD;
pastime you laud so warmly, you would accuse me of an unmanly&#xD;
fondness for a dish of scandal."&#xD;

What did he gay? What did it mean? His amusement&#xD;
increased with herr bewilderment, and before an explanation could&#xD;
be asked or given, Mr. Pemberton took. her hand.&#xD;
Ida had, thus far, passed the dullest of dull evenings. Lynn&#xD;
and Oharley who. never let her suffer for attention when they&#xD;
were byha~ a business engagement which would detain tben~&#xD;
until late; it was even doubtful if they could come at all. She&#xD;
talked at a moustached, be-whiskered, and be-imperialed youth&#xD;
who solicited an introduction, because he had heard that she was&#xD;
"smart," and hoped she could appreciate him; his conversa-&#xD;
tional talents compensating in quality for their deficiency in&#xD;
quantity; anybody could *talk, but who could dress, and stand,&#xD;
and look as he did? She tried to draw him out by encouraging&#xD;
smiles, imd well put queries-he tugged at his waistcoat-she&#xD;
rallied him upon his abstraction-he stroked his left whisket-.&#xD;
she pretended offence at one of his milk-and-water responses-he&#xD;
performed the like kindly office to the right-and she gave up&#xD;
in despair.&#xD;
Mr. De Langue was next. "He was "smart" himself; an~*&#xD;
therefore could appreciate her, and to prove this, he rolled forth&#xD;
volume after volume of French compliments, unanswerable,&#xD;
because so highly polished that one could not, as it were, take&#xD;
hold of them ;-edified her by disquisitions upon subjects of&#xD;
which she was profoundly ignorant, and information respecting&#xD;
others, of which she knew more than himself. After much&#xD;
manoouvring she sought refuge in a corner, fatigued, disgusted&#xD;
and misanthropical. "I have thought that I might shine in&#xD;
general company, where feeling never enters, and flaring flip-&#xD;
pancy passes for wit; it seemed easy to manufacture small-talk,&#xD;
but I was mistaken. This ia" rational recreation!' the pleasure&#xD;
of mingling in 'the ~best soci~~,' as Josephine says. I envy St.&#xD;
Simon in his twenty years' ~o1itude upon his stone pillar."&#xD;
"Compton, my dear fellow, can you make room for me to&#xD;
pass~?" said a voice near her. "If I were a lady, I would faint,&#xD;
and let you extricate me, as I am not, I must fight my way~&#xD;
(, The gentleman addressed exerted his powers of compression,&#xD;
and Mr. Lacy edged by him His course was towards the door,&#xD;
but he stopped as he espic~d Ida. "Miss Ross, have you a.&#xD;
&#xD;
1~I&#xD;
&#xD;
welcome in your 'Retreat' for a storm-tossed wanderer? Your&#xD;
quiet nook is most inviting."&#xD;
Ida looked up mischievously. "I will not hinder your flight,&#xD;
Mr. Lacy. Your envy of my corner is wasted upon one who&#xD;
heard you singing a moment since, like the melancholy starling,&#xD;
'I can't get out! I can't get out!'"&#xD;
"I plead guilty-but if a mightier temptation has mastered&#xD;
my desire for liberty? Ther~ are birds who will not fly after&#xD;
the cage door is unfastened.''&#xD;
"They do not merit freedo4a," said she.&#xD;
"Be it so-this is my prison," rejoined the gentleman, seat-&#xD;
ing himself upon an ottoman v~'hich Josephine, to get out of' the&#xD;
way, had wedged behind the 4oor, thinking as she did, that it&#xD;
might prevent the pressure ~f the crowd from breaking the&#xD;
hinges, with not a presentiment that she was furnishing a hiding-&#xD;
place for the last one of all 'the world whom she would have con-&#xD;
cealed.&#xD;
"Now," continued he, "as I can see but one, I recognize but&#xD;
one jailor, and you will be merciful, remembering my voluntary&#xD;
~incarceration. And as a starting-point to the conversation, why&#xD;
are you not in the other room&#xD;
"For the simple reason that no one has invited me to dance."&#xD;
He looked surprised, yet pleased at her frankness. "You&#xD;
would go, if you received an invitation ?"&#xD;
"That would depend upon circumstances. I should assuredly&#xD;
decline one from you.,~&#xD;
"And why ?"&#xD;
"I would not accept of anything offered in obedience to what&#xD;
the one who tendered it considered a hint. How I might act if&#xD;
I were a devotee of Terpeichore, I do not know, but a conversa-&#xD;
zione is more attractive to me than a ball,"&#xD;
"We shall not~quarrel there, and it is well that' we agree in&#xD;
disagreeing with the general sentiment. Taught by the experi-&#xD;
ence gained in our short acquaintance, I should prefer a petition&#xD;
with a quaking heart."&#xD;
"You need not apprehend a refusal, provided your demand i0&#xD;
reasonable and properly timed," answered Ida.&#xD;
"Which of these provisos was wanting to ensure the success&#xD;
of the suit you negative, 'upon the evening of our introduction ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7999-00000071"/>&#xD;
140                    ~L ONE.&#xD;
"Both," she returned~V laughing. "You insisted that i&#xD;
_ should sing, at sight, a song already dear to you, and I declined&#xD;
to spoil the music, and wreck my musical reputation wit~i a&#xD;
stranger, from whose mind I might never have an opportunity&#xD;
of removing the unfortunate opinion."&#xD;
In contrariety to these considerations, were the wish to&#xD;
oblige me, and a dislike to wound the feelings of your friend,&#xD;
Miss Josephine, and this scale kicked the beam ?" said Mr. Lacy,&#xD;
interrogatively.&#xD;
"No; Josephine was out of the question; she did not expect&#xD;
~ne to comply. We never sing together-or very rarely. My&#xD;
voice is not a contralto, nor does it accord with her's. You will&#xD;
have to be content with my explanation; I speak truth in the&#xD;
smallest matters."&#xD;
"The false in trifles are seldom reliable in things of greater&#xD;
moment," replied the other. "There is less deliberate, mali-&#xD;
cious falsehood in the world than we suppose. Men are oftener&#xD;
liars from habit, than from necessity or temptation."&#xD;
"But to this habit there must be a beginning. Is there no&#xD;
sin in the earliest deviation from the right way ?"&#xD;
"I did not say that there is not sin in every violation of truth.&#xD;
Each one is a stain upon the soul-blots, that too frequently&#xD;
deface it forever; but I do not subscribe to the casuistry that&#xD;
~gua.ges the guilt of a lie entirely by its effects upon others-which&#xD;
smiles upon, as a harmless simpleton, him who 'fibs' or 'yarns'&#xD;
or 'embroiders' in cowardice or vanity, and empties the vials of&#xD;
wrath upon the Pariah, who seeks, by one heaven-daring false-&#xD;
hood, to save what he holds most dear. One destroys the mirrror&#xD;
by gradually damaging itsbright surface, the other shivers it at&#xD;
e~ie reckless blow."&#xD;
"This has often struck me," said Ida. "It appears to me&#xD;
that the blower process deadens the conscience most surely, and&#xD;
the insensibility of those who practice it, betrays a more ,diseased&#xD;
state of the moral system than the pangs of remorse."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly; and this should make us doubly watchful&#xD;
against any infringement of veradty. The straightest, the only&#xD;
safe road is 'the truth-the whole truth-and nothing but th&amp;amp;&#xD;
"And i~ho adheres to this rule ?" asked Ida. "How much&#xD;
truth, do you imagine, is being uttered now in these rooms ?"&#xD;

"We are discoursing very philosophically, and will ~be chari.&#xD;
table enough to believe that numerous couples are similarly&#xD;
engaged."&#xD;
"iDo you recollect Talleyrand's definition of speech 7" inquired&#xD;
Ida.&#xD;
"'A faculty whereby we conceal our thoughts'-yes---a 50ff-&#xD;
tence worthy of its author. What a life this would be if we&#xD;
were all Talleyrands I"&#xD;

"A singular, sentiment for one of your age and sex I" replied&#xD;
Mr. acy, with a searching look. "Has the world served you&#xD;
so un indly, that you condemn your kind without reservation ?"&#xD;
ere was a~. mental reservation; yet my observation was&#xD;
true i a general sense. Men live for themselves ;-it is humi-&#xD;
liatin to see how this principle regulates feeling and action.&#xD;
We love our friends because they are ours ;-the pronoun 'my'&#xD;
expresses a nearness and sweetness which causes us to idolize the&#xD;
thing we appropriate ;-' my own' is the most endearing of appel-&#xD;
lations-what is the delight it inspires, but the grossest vanity&#xD;
and selfishness ?"&#xD;
"Par don me, that I differ with you. Our love is won by the&#xD;
qualities of its object ;-there would be no pleasure in appropria-&#xD;
tion were not our affections enlisted ;-no thrill of joy in identify-&#xD;
ing with ourselves, the unknown or unlovely;-if forced upon us,&#xD;
'dislike would ensue. We become attached to* our dear ones for&#xD;
their own sakes; although it cannot be denied, that a knowledge&#xD;
of a reciprocation of affection is an auxiliary to the' growth of&#xD;
that fondness."&#xD;
* "And do you honestly credit the disinterestedness of human&#xD;
nature 7"&#xD;
"I do-in many instances, and so. do you. Look at the bene-&#xD;
factors of mankind-a Howard, preferring the noisome prison-cell&#xD;
to competence and home ;-a Wilberforee, spending and spent in&#xD;
the great work ;~tlie missionaries of the cross, at this moment&#xD;
scattered in all lands, cut off from friends and civilization, without&#xD;
prospect of emolument or renown; forgotten, it may be, by all&#xD;
but Him, in whose strength they labor; where is the self-interest&#xD;
~in this?"&#xD;
"your last is a puzzling case. The theory I have advanced,&#xD;

perhaps too boldly, was pot of my own choosing.. I was com~&#xD;
pulled to it~ adoption by evidence which seemed incontestible,&#xD;
and I retain it because it solves more riddles in the complex&#xD;
machinery of society than any other I have heard. But it has&#xD;
its difficulties, and the main one is such conduct as you allude&#xD;
to. There is a key to the enigma, I suppose, if I could only&#xD;
find it."&#xD;
"There is," said Mr. Lacy, feelingly. "There is a love which&#xD;
*   purifies the rest, a peace we would have all men know. They&#xD;
err, who say that devotion to God weans the heart from our&#xD;
~friends. Our Divine Master has left us a new commandment-&#xD;
'that we love one another,' and with the increase of our love for&#xD;
Him, our soi4s enlarge, until the arms of brotherly kindness&#xD;
* embrace the universal family of mankind. There is no such&#xD;
being as a selfish Christian."&#xD;
Ida listened in amazement. This language was uncommon at&#xD;
any time and place ou~ of the pulpit, but from an elegant and.&#xD;
popular young man, it was novel in the extreme.&#xD;
"'I can hardly understand the workings of a principle, which&#xD;
is itself a mystery," she said. "Time was when religion was a&#xD;
household word to me, but exposure to adverse influences has&#xD;
erased from my mind all knowledge of this kind, if I ever had&#xD;
any understanding of its meaning.~~&#xD;
"You have, the instruction of the immortal spirit within you.&#xD;
Is that satisfied with ~ts fare?&#xD;
and your mode of life       Are you content with yourself&#xD;
"Content'!" The tone was a sufficient reply.&#xD;
"Will you allow me to use the freedom of a friend, Miss Ross,&#xD;
and show you that in neglecting this subject you shut your eyes&#xD;
to the only true happiness? I know that the lot which appears&#xD;
brightest is checkered with vicissitudes-.4i~ward struggles, more&#xD;
trying than many visible afflictions. Against these, neither the&#xD;
spirits of youth nor the reasoning of philosophy can always pre..&#xD;
vail. I know how the lip smiles and the heart bleeds, although&#xD;
the anguish within does not drown' the gay words upon the&#xD;
tongue. We may~we do conceal, but the sting rankles the&#xD;
same. Our Father never designed that we should be happy&#xD;
away from Him. ~'hese misgivings, this discontent with our..&#xD;

"Is what I am saying disagreeable to you ?"&#xD;
"No, sir ;-go on, if you please I"&#xD;
"Then, if we are told of One, who cannot only comfort,&#xD;

nothing can deprive us; who will make this life tolerable-nay,&#xD;

Him,-.-is it not the maddest folly to refuse the pledge He asks&#xD;
in return.-a child's love and trust ?"&#xD;
"I do not feel that I have acted thus 1" said Ida, suddenly.&#xD;
"My reason assents to what you have said, but my conscience&#xD;
'is dumb. The thought of a God-Almighty and Holy-over-&#xD;
whelms me with awe-~sometimes with terror. As Ruler and&#xD;
Judge, I pay him homage, and obey, when I can, the letter of&#xD;
His law';-.but He does not care particularly-for me-one of&#xD;
the most obscure of His countless subjects. I believe that He&#xD;
is a tender Father to the favored ones who have tasted His&#xD;
grace, and they ought to adore and love. I thank Him, from&#xD;
afar off, for preservation-not for creation'-and he does not call&#xD;
me nearer. You think me very wicked, Mr. Lasy ;-but as I&#xD;
said, if I speuk at all, I speak candidly."&#xD;
I like your truthfulness. You express what others secretly&#xD;
feel; this distant respect is the natural tone of an enlightened&#xD;

some,, to deadly enmity against' their Maker 'and Redeemer.&#xD;

"Yes-occasionally."&#xD;
"From what motive ?"&#xD;
"I read it as a curiosity in literature-but that 'is not the&#xD;

"J~xcuse me,.-I had no right to put the question. I wished&#xD;
to know if you had. noticed one or two passages-such as-~'All&#xD;
day long I have trencheded forth my hands unto a disobedient and&#xD;
gainsaying people.' 'When I called ye did not answer-when&#xD;
I spake, ye did not hear.' '0 Israel! thou hast destroyed thy-&#xD;
self, but in me is thy hope!' There is scarcely a page which&#xD;
does not bear some moving expostulation or entreaty; and the&#xD;
disciple who knew Him best, condenses in one celestial drop&#xD;
the stream of revelation, 'Gon is LoyE!' Not a word of Power&#xD;
or~ Justice! We cannot exaggerate these attributes,, but we&#xD;
may dwell upon them, to the exclusion of His 'long-suffering&#xD;
and loving kindness."&#xD;
"You have a strange way of speaking of these matters ;"&#xD;
said Ida.' "I am acquainted with a number of excellent Chris-&#xD;
tians~ who never refer to the .name by which they are called,&#xD;
but at long intervals, in set terms, and in a tone which frightens&#xD;
the 'sinners' to whom they address their exhortations. I have&#xD;
been troubled whether to question their sincerity, or the faith,&#xD;
which they assert, controls them."&#xD;
"Doubt neither Ascribe their silence to diffidence, or a&#xD;
fear of giving offence; their unhappy manner, to ignorance of&#xD;
~ proper method of managing hearts. It is to be regretted&#xD;
t the one Reality upon the globe should be .banished from&#xD;
familiar .conv~rsation. If a man is sleeping upon the sea-shore,&#xD;

if I end his happy slumbers? Or, to employ an illustration&#xD;
which suits me better-I have a dear friend, t~ whom you are a&#xD;
stranger. With my esteem for you, will not my desire to bring&#xD;
you together, grow stronger? When I discover traits in you.&#xD;
which he would approve, will not ' I tell you of him, and use&#xD;

require his assistance ;-an emergency is to overtake you, when&#xD;
all help but his will be vain-does it not become my imperative&#xD;
duty~ to implore you to accept the friendship he stands ready to&#xD;
bestow ?"&#xD;
"Do not the Scriptures speak of the veil that is upoi~ their&#xD;

"Yes-but it is the veil of unbelief. If we do not of&#xD;

selves endeavour to tear h away, the light which streams upon&#xD;
us, at its removal, may be too late. God does not need, but&#xD;
He demands our co-operation in His schemes for our salvation.&#xD;
There is our friend, Chancy Dana; he is late for a gentleman&#xD;
of his punctual habits."&#xD;
The conversation changed. Ida would gladly hav6 heard&#xD;
more of a topic, so unusual, and previously so unpleasing, but he&#xD;
dropped it, and she did not oppose him. The manner, more&#xD;
than the matter of his language, took her fanoy. He did not&#xD;
arrogate superiority of sense or goodness, and had none of the&#xD;
stereotyped cant she, dreaded; he did not preach, but talked,&#xD;
easily and quietly; most of the time, with the smile she&#xD;
thought so beautiful, and she observed his avoidance of "you"&#xD;
and "I,"-substituting, when it could be done-" we" and&#xD;
"us," as if to lay a platform of perfect equality. If he had&#xD;
intended to leave the room, when he fell in with her, he altered&#xD;
his purpose. Charley and Lynn paid their respects, chatted&#xD;
awhile, and went their ways ;-4he former to dance and jest&#xD;
with divers merry belles, who hailed his approach, a relief from&#xD;
the very minor flats, upon which they had been playing, during&#xD;
the tedious hours in the halls, which were ~zot "halls of mirth."&#xD;
Lynn sought Ellen Morris; and if Ida had seen the scarlet stain&#xD;
that suffused her cheeks, as 4ie perceived him, she would have&#xD;
had "confirmation strong" of a suspicion entertained from the&#xD;
first time she had beheld them together. Mr. Lacy withstood his&#xD;
jailor's offers of liberation. "If she were inclined to change&#xD;
her place, or to promenade, he was at her service, but no altera-'&#xD;
tion could better his condition ;" and Ida's fears of detailing&#xD;
him, being dissipated by this straight-forward avowal, ~she&#xD;
abandoned herself to the enjoyment of communion with a n~ble&#xD;
intellect and finely-attuned spirit. The announcement of supper,.&#xD;
the tocsin of liberty to a majority of the company, interrupted&#xD;
their lively dialogue.&#xD;
Long before this, Josephine's eyes had raked the parlours from&#xD;
wall t~ wall, and she was fully satisfied, or e~1is-satisfied that her&#xD;
polar star was missing.&#xD;
In the sickness 'of the' disappointment, she hated the show of&#xD;
pkasure going on about her: the most fagged-out of the chape-&#xD;
ron wall-flowers did not wish for the hour of separation more&#xD;

&#xD;
ardently than did she. There was one streak of light upon the&#xD;
cloud ;-no society could recompense him for parting with hers,&#xD;
and he had departed in consequence: but she could have bitten&#xD;
her tongue off, as she deplored* her injudicious declaration&#xD;
(untrue too!) of devotion to an amusement, for which she cared&#xD;
nothing. Was ever girl so impolitic? What if he were him-&#xD;
self one of this . "religious sort ?" the bare supposition was&#xD;
distracting! she had committed the unpardonable sin!&#xD;
"What have you done with Mr. Lacy ?" queried one and&#xD;
another, and a ready untruth answered, "He had an engage-&#xD;
merit, which obliged him to go early." Oharley overheard one&#xD;
repetition of this excuse; but although his eyes wandered, with&#xD;
a comical roll, towards the retreat of the recusant, he kept his&#xD;
own counsel. By supper-time, she was so convinced of the&#xD;
truth of her fabrication, that she neglected to institute a search&#xD;
which would have showed her Mr. Lacy and Ida, at the farthest&#xD;
end of the table. Twice again, she could have been blessed by&#xD;
a sight of him. Charley having invited Ida to a promenade in&#xD;
the hall, Mr. ]ieacy bethought him of his fair and partial hostess;&#xD;
but she was not to be found. * She was lying upon the bed in&#xD;
her chamber, fretting over her "foolishness," and the "stupidity&#xD;
and worry" of all parties,-her's in particular. Smoothing her&#xD;
face and ringlets, she regained the parlor by one door, as Morton&#xD;
left it by another. He encountered Ida and Charley, and&#xD;
walked with them until the carriages came to the door. Jose-&#xD;
phine accompanied several of her most fashionable guests to&#xD;
the dressing-room; and Mr. Lacy, seeing there was no one to&#xD;
receive his cong6, made none.&#xD;
The day after! Mr. Read was growly and .headachy;-Jo8e.&#xD;
phine in her worst hupior, and itching to vent it. The breakfast&#xD;
hour was enlivened by a continual peppering of small shot from&#xD;
her, varied by a big gun from her father. He sneered at her&#xD;
arrangements and company, saying much that was cuttingly&#xD;
true, more, really, than he was aware of; and she pecked at him&#xD;
and the servants. In spite of her dislike, Ida pitied her, as she&#xD;
surveyed the heaps of unwashed dishes and glasses.; the carpets,&#xD;
spotted with wine,~--cake and jelly trampled into their velvet;&#xD;
and the forlorn disorder that -reigned over all. She was on ihe&#xD;
point of offering her assistance, when Josephine brushed by her,&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.           14T&#xD;
&#xD;
with a peremptory order to "folks who were cluttering up the&#xD;
room, to be off if they did not mean to work !" Herself, the&#xD;
cat and the footman, who was collecting the remains of the feast,&#xD;
comprising the audi1~ory, Ida thought herself justifiable in taking&#xD;
a share of the hint.&#xD;
She sent Rachel down in her place, enjoining upon her, as a&#xD;
prudential measure, not to speak, unless when asked a direct&#xD;
question.&#xD;
As to Ida, the close of her evening had more than compensated&#xD;
for the ennui of the beginning; she had no foiled stratagems, no&#xD;
tangled snares to lament; yet the dissipation produced a nervous&#xD;
langaor, tempting, yet dissuading her from action. She read-&#xD;
and the letters danced cotillions and waltzes over the p'age. The&#xD;
piano was in the parlor-bu~t so was Josephine~. She essayed to&#xD;
sew, and stitched up a seam wrong side out, and run the point&#xD;
of the needle under her finger nail.&#xD;
"I must walk-I have it! Mrs. Dana will like to hear about&#xD;
- the party, and there is Elle's doll's hat."&#xD;
Her gloves were in a~ bureau drawer, and near them lay a&#xD;
velvet case, enclosing th~ miniature of her parents-excellent&#xD;
likenesses, but owing to some oversight in mixing, or in the&#xD;
quality of the colors, they were fading already. She had signi-&#xD;
fied to Mr. Read her intention to have them copied, before they&#xD;
should be so much defaced as to render it impracticable; why&#xD;
not give them to Lynn? His ability was uncontrovertible-it&#xD;
would be a kindness to him now, in the outset of his professional&#xD;
career; and she had the vanity to believe that he would bestow&#xD;
double pains upon what she so valued. She would carry them&#xD;
to Mrs. Dana, and ask her advice.&#xD;
That lady was in her nursery, which was one of Ida's accus-&#xD;
tomed haunts. She was at home at once; tossing the babe, and&#xD;
joining her voice to its chuckling laugh, until the room rang&#xD;
* again; Charley hanging upon her dress to entreat her praises of&#xD;
* his hQbby-horse; and Elle waiting patiently to kiss her for the&#xD;
"sweet bonnet that just fitted Dolly."&#xD;
"You have come tostay a good long time with me, I know,"&#xD;
said. Mrs. Dana. "Here is a note I was about to send to you,&#xD;

"But indeed, my dear miss, you will remove your bonnet&#xD;
immediately."&#xD;
Resistance was useless; nor would Ida have 'offered it, had&#xD;
she* been sure of meeting only the family; for the sun shone&#xD;
more brightly into this home-nest of cheerful peace, than into the&#xD;
abode she had lately quitted. The Danas knew enough of Mr.&#xD;
Read and Josephine, to make them solicitous to withdraw Ida1&#xD;
as much from their influence as was consistent with her duty as!&#xD;
a ward. She never complained, except to Carry, but they&#xD;
respected her the more for her prudence.&#xD;
"You will spoil me," said shM, as Mrs. Dana untied her&#xD;
l~onnet&#xD;
"No danger," replied the lady, kissing her forehead-Carry's&#xD;
caress-.and as other lips did, years ago. Tears stood in the&#xD;
o~phan's eyes, but they did not fall. 1~lle wondered why cousin~&#xD;
Ida could not see her doll's cloak without holding her head a.&#xD;
near to it.&#xD;
Mrs.. Dana approved entirely of her project.&#xD;
"Will you take them to him this morning ?" inquired she.&#xD;
"I certainly had such a notion, but I do not like to go witkut&#xD;
you, and as you are expecting company&#xD;
"No time like the present, my dear. My dinner is in the&#xD;
bands of the cook; I shall not be wanted here for two hours. It&#xD;
is a lovely day, and I am glad of an errand that afford~ an excuse&#xD;
to go out."&#xD;
" As they were passing "Dana &amp;amp;~ Co.'s" she halte~.&#xD;
"Had~ we not better ask Mr. Dai~a to pilot us? I am uncer-&#xD;
tain of the exact locality of this same studio."&#xD;
Mr. Dana could not go; he was waiting upon a country cus-&#xD;
~tomer with a memorandum as long as his arm; but he conducted&#xD;
the ladies into the counting-room. Charley was there, at a tall&#xD;
desk, buried in ledgers and filed bills; and so business-like, tl~at&#xD;
&#xD;
Ida hung back upon the threshold-a, fear of which she was&#xD;
ashamed, as he extended both hands to her thanked them for&#xD;
their visit, and offered to escort them. He unlocked his bache-&#xD;
lor's pantry of crackers, cheese and choice Madeira, hospitality&#xD;
which they civilly declined. Mr. Dana left the' counter "to hope&#xD;
that he should, see Miss Ida at dinner;" a courtesy which was a&#xD;
a sign of esteem and favor from one of his reticent disposition.&#xD;
Lynn's studio was a small, but exquisitely appointed room.&#xD;
It was a minute before the eyes, used to the out-door light, could&#xD;
penetrate the claro-obscuro of its twilight.&#xD;
Ida knew Lynn by his voice, and pressure of her hand, then&#xD;
a taller figure was developed to her vision, and she recognized&#xD;
Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"Are you engaged, Mr. Holmes ?" asked Mrs. Dana.&#xD;
"No, madam; Mr. Lacy has just concluded a sitting-the&#xD;
last. Your coming is opportune, you can criticism his portrait."&#xD;
The voice was unanimous. . It was a masterly painting, and&#xD;
faithful to life.&#xD;
"A personable individual too, Morton-considering~.--" said&#xD;
Charley. "Did you have it painted for a sign-board? "Morton&#xD;
Lacy, attorney at law,-For recommendations, see heading of&#xD;
this article.' What a multitude of lady-clients you would&#xD;
have 1"&#xD;
"It is f~r a lady who will not part with it, even to procure&#xD;
me a press of clients-for my mother," returned Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"She will feel herself to be under great obligations to you, Mr.&#xD;
Holmes, for so truthful a transcript of her 'absent boy.'"&#xD;
Ida looked at the original instead of the picture; It was, then,&#xD;
the handsomer of the two. With a complimentary observation&#xD;
of the workmanship, he dismissed the subject, and directed Ida&#xD;
to a genuine Claude, Lynn's pride and boast. She slipped her&#xD;
case into Mrs. Dana's hand, and followed him.&#xD;
approached.        '                      Lynn presently&#xD;
"It would be an idle form to say that I am honoured by your&#xD;
application," said he. "Your heart will tell you how I esteen~&#xD;
this proof of your friendship. It is a sacred trust, and as'~uel~&#xD;
I will fulfil it."&#xD;
"I feared you would discourage me," replied Ida. "Is it not&#xD;
difficult to take a picture, the size of life, from a miniature 7"&#xD;

"It requires care, and a just regard to proportions; but I Jiave&#xD;

I hope-I know I shall not fail. Now, what shall I do to enter-&#xD;

such ladies I that I am at a loss how to bear my honors."&#xD;
"Where are those long-promised port-folios ?" said Ida. "We&#xD;
could not desire a more acceptable treat."&#xD;
The hour consumed in the examination of the artist's pictured&#xD;
treasures, was, to Ida, one of unalloyed delight. There might&#xD;
yet be diamonds in the pebbly sands of Richmond. Coke&#xD;
loomed up threateningly before Mr. Lacy; and Charley and&#xD;
Mrs. Dana felt some conscience-prickings, at the thought of Day..&#xD;
books and desserts; but they did 'not offer to stir until Lynn&#xD;
affirmed that he had nothing more to show.&#xD;
"There are go~d points in this working..day life of ours, a&#xD;
there not ?" said 9harley, as they went down the steps.&#xD;
"Just my sent iments I" answered Mr. Lacy. "Yet Mr.&#xD;
Holmes is a dangerous citizen. He has beguiled an unsuspecting&#xD;
youth out of two hours of study. This is my apology for leaving&#xD;
pleasant company ;~.-it is a consolation to a benevolent-minded&#xD;
/ person like myself, to know that I, and not they, will suffer from&#xD;
the separation. Adieu I"&#xD;
"'Till dinner-time," said Mrs. Dana.&#xD;
Mr. Dana coi~ivened a circle of friends to meet a youtig&#xD;
Northerner, the hearer of an introductory letter from his New&#xD;
York partner; a~d it was apparent that his ideas of the boun-&#xD;
daries of civilization-' North by Cape Cod-South by Sandy&#xD;
Ilook'-were seriously shaken by this peep at Virginia life.&#xD;
Mrs. Dana was, Charley maintained, a "star housekeeper'; and&#xD;
her laurels did not wilt to-day. A perfect understanding existed&#xD;
between her and her head-waiter, 'Uncle Abraham.' She did&#xD;
not issue an order; ~and in emulation of her quiet manner, his.&#xD;
instructions to his satellites were inaudible to the guests. Mr.&#xD;
Lacy, Lynn, Mr. Brigham, (the stranger,) Mr. Violet, a French&#xD;
gentleman, whose amiability and politeness would have been his&#xD;
passport in any kingdom and clime, Mr. Thornton, recently&#xD;
admitted to the bar, and a fair sample of the educated South-&#xD;
erner; with the two Danas, and the ladies, made up the company.&#xD;
Mr. Thornton sat by Ida; Mr. Lacy opposite. His quick&#xD;

&#xD;
look of pleasure, as he was shown his place, indicated his satis..&#xD;
faction; and although he did not interfere with her brilliant&#xD;
neighbor by addressing her in words, he did so frequently by his&#xD;
eye and smile. The conversation streamed on in a glittering&#xD;
tide ;-Mr. Thornton, always ready with fun or sense, and ,&#xD;
Charley, whose creed interdicted flagging chit-chat leading-&#xD;
then Lynn, warming, dashed in; pursued,. very cautiously, by&#xD;
Mr. Brigham. Mr. Villet cheered them on by his gusto of&#xD;
every repartee; and John. Dana set his seal of confirmation&#xD;
upon each profound remark. Mr. Lacy said comparatively&#xD;
little; he seemed to prefer looking on; but his intelligent counte-&#xD;
nance spoke so eloquently for him, that his silence did not&#xD;
obstruct the hilarious current. There was another listener, who&#xD;
entered heartily into the spirit of the hour ;-never imagining&#xD;
that the speakers gathered animation from her beaming. face.&#xD;
She was oblivious of the fact of her bodily presence, until&#xD;
brought to the knowledge.by the host's,&#xD;
"Mr. Lacy,-Miss Ross will take a. glass of wine with you."&#xD;
Mr. Lacy spoke a word to the servant who stood prepared to&#xD;
fill his glass; and bowing with graceful composure to his&#xD;
vis4-vis----&#xD;
"Miss Ross will not forbid my pledging her health and&#xD;
happiness in a purer draught," he said, and raised a tumbler of&#xD;
water to his lips.&#xD;
Temperance societies were not much in vogue in those days;&#xD;
and were not in such odor as now; and this movement&#xD;
astounded all present. Mr. Thornton, who had the common&#xD;
infirmity of wits, who have not learned the inadequacy of this&#xD;
one talent,-rare 'though it be,-to supply the loss of every-&#xD;
thing else: and whose greatest fault was, that he ran his&#xD;
trenchant blade as often* into the breast of a friend, as foe,&#xD;
assailed his professional brother on the spot. He was parried.&#xD;
with immovable good humour; and the others came to his aid;&#xD;
some with arguments, some with questions. Even Mr. Villet&#xD;
could~ not refrain from a cut of polite ridicule. The assailed&#xD;
maintained his ground manfully;. neither staggered nor die..&#xD;
mayed ~l~y the odds against him. He knew every foot of the&#xD;
field~~ng fought upon it more times than any of them.&#xD;
Charle'~y laid down his arms first-' silenced if not convinced'&#xD;

he owned; Mr. Thornton was 'floored' by a thrust equal to his&#xD;
last blow;-the fate of the battle was to be determined by single&#xD;
combat; Lynn being unvanquished. He *as an expert fencer;&#xD;
and changing his tactics, stood upon the defensive. Once and&#xD;
again, was he forced into a corner, from which retreat appeared&#xD;
impossible; and as often was he seen the next moment, fighting&#xD;
in the open plain, with unbattered crest. His .opponent pro-&#xD;
posed a suspension of hostilities, but the auditors vetoed it&#xD;
peremptorily. .They were alike amused and interested ; and&#xD;
Mr. Lacy observed, with a smile, that the ruby poison, the&#xD;
engenderer of the strife, was untouched during the discussion.&#xD;
Mrs. Dana made a feint of withdrawal, and was solicited to&#xD;
remain, 'to be in at the death,' Charley said. He had a double&#xD;
motive in 'supporting the request; he foresaw defeat for Lynn;&#xD;
and although the admirable temper of the argument was likely&#xD;
to continue to the end, he judged it best to keep his gallantry in&#xD;
play, as a balance-wheel to his impetuosity. The event did not&#xD;
disappoint his expectation. Lynn was game to the last, but&#xD;
surrender or not, he was indubitably beaten. Mr. Lacy covered&#xD;
his enemy's rout by a flattering tribute to his argumentative&#xD;
abilities, and the two laughingly shook hands, as hyaoe&#xD;
from the board.                            ,steare&#xD;
In the parlor, their undisputed court, the ladies received&#xD;
the attention which had been diverted from them by the wordy&#xD;
war-.&#xD;
" To show that I bear no malice for old scores, I repeat the&#xD;
petition that met with so obstinate refusal,'" said Mr. Lacy, giving&#xD;
Ida his arm. "Will you sing for me?"&#xD;
"'Say, what shall my song be to-night)     .&#xD;
And the strain at your bidding shall flow,'"&#xD;
she replied, running her fingers over the keys.&#xD;
" That I leave to you. I do not know what suits your voice&#xD;
or taste.'"&#xD;
"'tThe last rose of summer,' " prompted Charley; " afterwards,&#xD;
the 'Captive Knight.'"&#xD;
Mr. 'Lacy laughed; supposing he intended a satire upon the&#xD;
"~miscellaneous" songsters,. he had also thought of, when heo'&#xD;
objected to making a selection; and Ida, slightly piqued at his&#xD;
want of confidence in her powers of vocalization, sang both with&#xD;

/&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
inimitable skill and expression. The gentlemen pressed around&#xD;
to ask, each, for his favorite song. She complied readily and&#xD;
patiently.' The natural compass and strength of her voice had&#xD;
been increased by diligent practice, yet music was with her, more&#xD;
a passion than an art; her songs, spirit-utterances instead of the&#xD;
compositions of others, learned by note.&#xD;
"She is actually beautiful!I" said Mr. Dana, aside to his&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
uSomething above the order of puppets, nicknamed young&#xD;
ladies, with which people ornament their parlors now-a-days,"&#xD;
was the reply.&#xD;
Removed from the gnome-like regards of Josephine, she was,&#xD;
indeed, a different being. The presence of this girl was a mental&#xD;
extinguisher-smothering the flame of feeling in fetid smoke-&#xD;
the kindliness of the Danas, the generous oil feeding the exhausted&#xD;
lamp. Years afterwards, when 'the purple flush had faded from&#xD;
life's morning; the scene preceding her departure upon this even-&#xD;
ing, would recur, as one of the pr udest and happiest moments of&#xD;
her existence-John Dana, stance ing in front of her, his grave&#xD;
features relaxed into a smile o1 fatherly fondness, as he heard&#xD;
her defence of herself against an accusation of Mr. Thornton's--&#xD;
Mrs. Dana, her hand upon her husband's shoulder, listening and&#xD;
enjoying-Charley and Lynn, her allies and counsellors, waiting&#xD;
to add their testimony-Mr. Lacy sitting beside her, ahd drink-&#xD;
ing in her words with an avidity that brought the blood tingling&#xD;
to her cheeks, and excited the meaning smiles of the spectators.&#xD;
She was in her proper sphere; the centre and idol of a home-&#xD;
circle. -The praises lavished upon her were honestly won-too&#xD;
much would have satiated, not spoiled-the utter absence of&#xD;
reward soured her.&#xD;
" I have had a happy, happy day, dear Mrs. Dana !" whispered&#xD;
she, at going. u"I shall write to Carry to-morrow, to' apprise&#xD;
ner how well you fill her place."&#xD;
SMr. Lacy attended her home. Curiosity had -set for him the&#xD;
study' of her character. Her mien bespoke no ordinary soul;-&#xD;
and the inuendloes of Josephine, meant to deter him from pro-&#xD;
secuting it, stimulated his desire. -They had been together&#xD;
repeatedly, previous to the party, but always in thie company of&#xD;
the Extinguisher. Herarch glance and rejoinder to his thought&#xD;

less remark, while recalling Josephine's insinuation of her hoy&#xD;
denish propensities, nevertheless fascinated him. From being&#xD;
amused, he grew interested; he was working a* mine of thought,&#xD;
and unless the clue was false, there was a substratum of feeling.&#xD;
The friendship of the Danas convinced him that the heart was&#xD;
warm and true. He saw the frank girl ~amidst the friends in the&#xD;
studio, and the accomplished woman in t~ie coterie of the evening;&#xD;
and could not say which was most attractive. "So much intel-&#xD;
ligence and so little affectation are seldom seen in the same&#xD;
person ;" he meditated. "She has the materials for a noble&#xD;
character." Did he think to mould it!&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
OUR youthful debutantes were plunged into the maelstr6m of&#xD;
a fashionable season; a whirl which, in its outermost circles, was&#xD;
as gratifying to the* feVerish energy of Ida as to the vanity of&#xD;
her more grovelling-minded associate. The rapidly shortening&#xD;
days seemed longer instead, so uneventful and wearisome were&#xD;
they. Life commenced when the evening's thousand~ lamps were&#xD;
lit. The mingling perfumes; the crush and flutter; the wave-&#xD;
like roar of the assembly-room, were delicious excitement to the&#xD;
emancipated school-girl; and to the astonishment of those who&#xD;
had known her then, the reserved student bloomed into the&#xD;
dashing wit and belle; beauties and heiresses sitting, uncounted&#xD;
by, while "eligibles" contended for the honor of her preference.&#xD;
Her newness was a part of the secret. The spectacle of a wild&#xD;
Zingara, utireigned, and glorying in the fullness of its freedom,&#xD;
scorning bit and spur, amongst a pack of jaded hackneys, who&#xD;
have been trotted and paced ,and galloped, year after year, until&#xD;
their factitious animation and oft-repeated gambols created pity&#xD;
and contempt, would cause a sensation akin to that awakened by.&#xD;
her appearance. Her. lightest words were jeux d'espr~t; her&#xD;
laugh, a chime of silver wedding-bells; (things by the jvay, of&#xD;
which every body talks, but nobody we have questioned, ever&#xD;
heard,) her singing seraphic; her ballads lyric gems; h~rse1f a&#xD;
Corinne. Josephine was latest to perceive, first to resent this&#xD;

&#xD;
sudden accession of popularity. Rivalry from this source was as&#xD;
unexpected as unbearable. Her glass showed her a form, airy&#xD;
as a summer cloud; a set of features more delicate and regular&#xD;
than Ida's characteristic'physiognomy; and in dress, she certainly&#xD;
bore off the palm~ her maid being invariably rung up an hour&#xD;
and a half before Rachel's services were demanded. She fought,&#xD;
as long as she could, with the conviction that this pre-eminence&#xD;
was as though it had not been to the world; and when it made&#xD;
a violent entrance into her circumscribed intellect, how was the&#xD;
milk of her nature curdled to vinegar! And how like nitre to&#xD;
vinegar, were the happily-chosen congratulations of her attendant&#xD;
beaux, upon her good fortune in inhabiting the same house with&#xD;
"her charming friend, Miss Ross;" or, "Miss Ida even surpasses&#xD;
herself to-night;" "A remarkable girl! such vivacity! and I&#xD;
hear, quite as much profundity of mind; is this so, Miss Read ?"&#xD;
And the writhing dissembler had to assent, and corroborate, and&#xD;
smile, while the yeasty waves frothed and bubbled furiously in&#xD;
their confinement. To expose her envy would damage her pros-&#xD;
pects, hinged as they were, in. part, upon her sweetness of dispo-&#xD;
sition.&#xD;
It might have been a salvo to her wounded vanity had she&#xD;
guessed by what a length of time her jealousy outlived the tri-&#xD;
umph which aroused it; how the feast of adulation, so daintily&#xD;
spread, ceased to tempt, then nauseated; how, from the jewelled&#xD;
robe of society the gloss wore away, and threadbare tatters were&#xD;
all that remained of what was cloth of gold; how prevarications&#xD;
and oaths refused longer to shelter falsehood; and the garlands&#xD;
withered and shrank from manacles which heated with the wear-&#xD;
ing; how the earth itself was a thin, holkw ball, that one could&#xD;
puff away with a breath; how, ore the fire the revel had infused&#xD;
into her veins cooled, the coronal was plucked from the brow,&#xD;
the costly attire crushed petulantly, a worthless rag! And at&#xD;
that window, the freezing air not chiUing 'her heated blood-4he&#xD;
envied one wept blistering tears of self-abhorrence and despon~~&#xD;
dency-and the night-wind 'sighed to the moan.-." Not this!&#xD;
not this !" and the old prayer for "liberty and love!" We' say,&#xD;
had she known this, she might have felt avenged; but*the public~&#xD;
nor she, saw any alteration in its1 fondling and her &amp;amp;etestatk~,&#xD;

1~een given in breathless succession, and Ellen Morris issued&#xD;
tickets for yet another. The appointed hour saw ~he house over-&#xD;
flowing. Ida was near the centre of the front parlor, radiant and&#xD;
flattered ~s usual. One gentleman, with an air of easy assur-&#xD;
ance, was inspecting her bouquet; a second, pushing a mock&#xD;
flirtation ~'4th all his might; a third, a callow youngster, afraid&#xD;
to speak t4i the "bright particular," he had so panted to behold,&#xD;
staring into her face in sheepish agony; and a fourth peered&#xD;
over the shoulder of number one.&#xD;
"The camelia, Miss Ida, what is its emblem ?" asked the&#xD;
bouquet holder.&#xD;
"B'eauty without wit ;" rejoined she, but half hearing him,&#xD;
and then finishing a sentence to No. 2.&#xD;
"Without amiability, you mean," corrected No. 4.&#xD;
"Without wit I" said . Ida. "I relish an active perfume,&#xD;
which can be detected without effort of mine, and do not prize a&#xD;
flower that must be bruised to extract its sweetness; amiability&#xD;
is, at best, a passive virtue."&#xD;
"But what is a beautiful woman without softness, tenderness,&#xD;
effeminacy ?" said No. 2, whose stock of words exceeded that of&#xD;
ideas. "She wins us by her yielding submissiveness, 'her gentle&#xD;
mildness. Destitute and devoid of these, she is to me without&#xD;
charm or attraction. Do not i~inderstand me, however, as depre-&#xD;
ciating or undervaluing wit in your presence I" recollecting him-&#xD;
self, with a salaam.&#xD;
"No apologies are necessary. We all agree that such depre-&#xD;
ciatiou would come with a bad grace from Mr. Talbot," said ~[da,&#xD;
pointedly, returning a still deeper curtsey.&#xD;
No. 1 nodded, as he laughed, to some one beside her. "Good&#xD;
evening," said Mr. Lacy, as she looked around.&#xD;
"And he has overheard this nonsensical stuff 1" thought she,&#xD;
with inward disturbance. "When did you come in ?" she&#xD;
"About ten minutes since; most of ~hich time has been&#xD;
spent in ~ search for Mrs. or Mi s Morris."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it."  I&#xD;
"Glad~-how ?"&#xD;
"I feared you had occupied y 'ur present position some time."&#xD;
He understood her. "There are more people here than I&#xD;
expected to see," he said, after some general conversation. I&#xD;

&#xD;
"Almost too many," replied Ida; "I am getting tired of&#xD;
4iese great parties."&#xD;
"The heat is oppressive. Have you a liking for this stand ?"&#xD;
"No-my being here is accidental. It requires some effort to&#xD;
stand, or walk upright, in the heart of this crowd.&#xD;
"I noticed, as I came through, that the- music room was more&#xD;
thinly ~opulated-will you rest there ?"&#xD;
This was a mere boudoir compared with others of the suite~&#xD;
and the prepossessions of the corn ~any were for music of a differ-&#xD;
ent kind. The violin was discou~sing its enchanting strains in&#xD;
the farther apartment, and there were not above a dozen persons&#xD;
in the one, where slumbered the piano and guitar.&#xD;
"Are you indisposed, Miss Ross ?" asked Mr. Brigham, who&#xD;
was fanning a fragile-looking girl, reclining in an easy chair.&#xD;
"No-only tired. You have aeted wisely in shunning the&#xD;
press and bustle, Miss Moore. I~ am happy to see you able to&#xD;
venture out in the evening."&#xD;
"Your climate is doing wonderful things for me," answered&#xD;
Miss Moore, smiling.&#xD;
"How dreadful to be deprived of health, and the hope of a&#xD;
long life 1" said Ida, when they were seated.&#xD;
"And especially mournful in this instance, if I am not&#xD;
deceived !" replied Mr. Lacy. "I pity that man! he will not&#xD;
believe that bereavement is inevitable; and if 'death was ever&#xD;
b~ handed upon human brow,' it is t~pon hers."&#xD;
"I honor his constancy and devotion," said Ida. "The&#xD;
o ject of his visit in~ the fall, was to acquaint himself with&#xD;
the advantages our city possesses for invalids; then he went&#xD;
back for her mother and herself. He is both brother and lover.&#xD;
Who would have expected this from a man of his phlegmatic&#xD;
constitution ?"&#xD;
"Another warning of the folly of judging by appearances.&#xD;
It is possible, too, that we who areyitying her are as much in&#xD;
~want of compassion. The highest happiness is unaffected by&#xD;
extraneous influences."&#xD;
"Happiness I" echoed Ida. "It is a myth."&#xD;
"So says the sage of eighteen-.-.gay, gifted and caressed I&#xD;

"A ~monster who does not exhibit himself often ;" returned&#xD;
Ida. "This is but the second large party at which I have seen&#xD;
you. Are you principled against them ?"&#xD;
"No, and yes. I do not disapprove of social pleasures. They&#xD;
make light, yet firm, the bands that cement our species. Their&#xD;
suppression would convert the most benevolent into a morose&#xD;
eremite; but I do see incipient evil in the frequency of these&#xD;
scenes. Setting aside the waste of time, which may belong to&#xD;
matters of importance, sooner or later they produce a disrelish&#xD;
for domestic duties, and an enervation, physical and mental, like&#xD;
the languorous sobriety ofa topcr. There is nothing nourishing&#xD;
in the immortal mind, in a ceaseless round of gaiety."&#xD;
"How do you know, by personal experience ?"&#xD;
"Even so. I once drank pretty deeply of Pleasure s cup-.&#xD;
did not drain it to the lees-.-but drew off the clear wine, and was&#xD;

friends over since. My sister writes that his portrait of myself&#xD;
is a solace in the loneliness of her sick chamber. She has the&#xD;
kindest of mothers aAd friends, but there are 1~imes when they&#xD;
are unavoidably absent, and she is childish enough to talk to the&#xD;
dumb semblance* of one who is not worthy of her love, and&#xD;
Imagine that it looks back its answers."&#xD;
"Have you but one sister ?"&#xD;
"But one at home-.-three are married. Annie seems nearer&#xD;
to me; she is next me in age, and until a year ago was my&#xD;
inseparable companion~."&#xD;
His eye rested upon Miss Moore. "We were speaking of&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       15cb&#xD;
happiness in affliction. If ~keptical on this head, you should&#xD;
know her. She is never free from pain and never impatient;&#xD;
her sunny, loving temper, makes her room the resort of the&#xD;
neighborhood-~but this does not interest you."&#xD;
"Not interest me !" said Ida, reproachfully. "Do you then&#xD;
think me the heartless creature I appear? I am not wholly&#xD;
absorbed in self. We have never conversed as strangers; do&#xD;
not let us retrograde now. True, I have no sister, but I have a&#xD;
friend who is more to me, so I may listen."&#xD;
"Thank you," said he sincerely. "I have feared you might&#xD;
deem my informal address presumptuous; but I seem to have&#xD;
known you for yeaI~s, not months. I cannot wear my compaiiy&#xD;
manners when talking to you."&#xD;
"Perhaps we have met before, in an anterior state of exist-&#xD;
ence," replied Ida; "and lurking memories of introductions,&#xD;
and compliments, and staid courtesies, render these preliminaries&#xD;
odious now. I could be sure, sometimes, that my spirit has&#xD;
lived in this world before it tenanted its present body."&#xD;
~' These are fascinating, yet dangerous . speculations," he&#xD;
answered. "I am tormented by them myself, but I shun&#xD;
them as unprofitable."&#xD;
"Why so? The soul, as our nobler part, merits most study;&#xD;
its mysteries are yet undiscovered. What a field expands to&#xD;
our contemplation! over which the mind may rove and exult&#xD;
for ages, and leave unimpoverished. I would not barter one&#xD;
hour of such thoughts-~--chimerical though they may be-for&#xD;
ten years 6f this vapid, surface life. I had rather dive into the&#xD;
ocean, to bring up nothing but valueless shells, than drift, like&#xD;
dead sea-weed, upon the top of the sleepy waves."&#xD;
"May I describe another mode of life and action 7"&#xD;
"Certainly-so you do not laugh at me."&#xD;
"Do you apprehend that I shall ?" fixing hi~ clear eye upon&#xD;
her's. "I would remind you of the humble mariner, steering&#xD;
his vessel boldly, but carefully, through the waters, thankful in&#xD;
sunshine, courageous in tempest, with one port in view~ rowing&#xD;
past the Fairy. islands that stud the deep; keeping a straight&#xD;
path in a trackless waste, for he looks to the eternal heavens for&#xD;
guidance.~~&#xD;

quite comprehend me, Mr. Lacy. T have told you more than'&#xD;
once that life has thus far been a disappointment to me, but it&#xD;
is not that I have sucked the orange dry, and would cast the&#xD;
tasteless pulp away., Mine has been so acid I must hope that&#xD;
time and the sun of prosperity will ripen, it to lusciousness.&#xD;
Others ~tell of unknown depths of happiness I have capacity to&#xD;
enjoy-am I unreasonable in trusting that my turn will come?&#xD;
ave tasted all of earth's delights at eighteen ?"&#xD;
"Could you quaff them at one draught, your thirst would~ not&#xD;
be appeased. You are no nearer to contentment now than you&#xD;
were three~ years since. The drink-offering of popular award is&#xD;
growing dull and stale; and you sigh at what would have chased&#xD;
gloom a month ago, and this is the hey-day of pleasure. Nay,"&#xD;
continued he, dropping his earnest tone, and* bending to look&#xD;
into her face, "I shall not forgive myself if I mar your even-&#xD;
ing's entertainment by my croakiz~g.- Messrs. Talbot &amp;amp; Co.'s&#xD;
anathemas against my impertinent monopoly do not occasion&#xD;
me a hundredth part of the disquiet your very sober face does.&#xD;
Mr. Thornton is coming to ask you to dance. Will you go ?"&#xD;
"'Fatigued 1" exclaimed the barrister, to her excuse. "I&#xD;
should as soon admit the plea of a star for ceasing to shine upon&#xD;
the pretext that it was too troublesome to continue its light."&#xD;
"Has there never been such a disappearance ?" questioned&#xD;
Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"I have seen eclipses," retorted the other. "The sun is&#xD;
invisible, wheu 'the leaden moon comes between it and us.&#xD;
This music is too inspiriting, I Iiss Ross; am I reduced to the&#xD;
necessity of seeking another partner ?"&#xD;
"I am sorry I can't say 'no,"' said she, laughingly.&#xD;
Mr. Lacy was bent upon expelling the regrets reflection might&#xD;
beget; and wiled into confidence by his gentle endeavors to&#xD;
induce a *trust in him as a friend, Ida spoke freely, though not&#xD;
unguardedly, of feelings and thoughts which had been so long&#xD;
hushed, that their speech was slow and imperfect; but he inter-&#xD;
preted. and prized their stammered story. As the night wore&#xD;
on, exhausted couples dropped in, and there was an end to con-&#xD;
'ncoted conversation. It was as well, for both were forgetting&#xD;
where they were. Morton relinquished his chair to Ellen, and&#xD;
stood by her, and Lynn sank, playfully, upon one knee before Ida.&#xD;
&#xD;
161&#xD;
&#xD;
"Take care I', was his whisper. U Serpents coil in rose~&#xD;
thickets."&#xD;
What do you mean ?" inquired she, struck and chilled.&#xD;
That we are the most tenacious of that to which we have&#xD;
the most m~agre title."&#xD;
"A masculine Sphynx! speak out !" she demanded;&#xD;
"Miss Read could enact U~1dipus to this riddle. Seriously,&#xD;
Id~a, beware of that woman! She courts Lacy's society. I do&#xD;
not~know what the ladies' verdict is-to us it is as plain as that&#xD;
he does not like her half as well as he does you. Do not avoid&#xD;
him'~ he deserves your favor; but do nothing to uncover her&#xD;
eyes-blindfolded by her egregious conceit."&#xD;
"Lynn! you confound me! What have I to do with Mr.&#xD;
Lacy! I have no interests which would war with hers, were they&#xD;
ever so strong. Having nothing to lose, I have nothing to fear.&#xD;
I am obliged to you' for your brotherly cares," she added,&#xD;
roguishly. "A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind."&#xD;
"You know it, then I". exclaimed he, his large eyes, splendid&#xD;
in their flash of intelligence and rapture.&#xD;
"I am not insensible ~r indifferent, where the happiness of&#xD;
my friends is concerned," she rejoined, in the same confidential&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
Another gleam thanked her.&#xD;
Ellen Morris was what is termed, a "taking girl." The high,&#xD;
gay Spirit, which had distinguished her among her comrades at&#xD;
Mr. Purcell's won her distinction in a world willing 'to be amused.&#xD;
She had objectionable traits, but there was also 'much that was&#xD;
admirable and loveable about her. '~ If her over-weening fond-&#xD;
ness for merriment offended, it was easy to forgive one, whose&#xD;
lively sense of the comic was inbred and' irresistible. Still, it&#xD;
was a marvel that the impassioned Lynn should recognize in her&#xD;
the embodiment of his poetic dream of woman. They met&#xD;
before he went to Europe, and the tricks sprite of a school-girl&#xD;
was not dislodged from his memory by the lures that tried, him&#xD;
there. He came back to find a blooming maiden preserving the&#xD;
fresh, joyous grace which had captivated him in the child-and&#xD;
loved! as men seldom love-as women often do-.--with an aban-&#xD;
don of affection, an unyielding of every faculty and 'thought to&#xD;

payment for his cautionary remai~k, she hinted, That, situated&#xD;
~as they were, misconstruction and jealousy might be formidable&#xD;
foes to his peace of mind :-.--that neither smiles nor frowns&#xD;
were unerring indices of a girl's heart. He scouted the implied&#xD;
suspicion,&#xD;
"Jealous, of these popenjays I" glancing disdainfully at the&#xD;
black coats and white vests in attendance, as if he thought they&#xD;
contained wound-up automata.&#xD;
"The danger does not appear imminent ;" said she. "See&#xD;
that you retain this satisfied state of mind;"&#xD;
Her countenance fell, and he hear&amp;amp; Josephine say, simper-&#xD;
ingly-&#xD;
"How dramatic! pray, Mr. Holmes, is this a rehearsal, or a&#xD;
real performance ?"&#xD;
"'Most ladies are so versed in love affairs, as to understand&#xD;
the symptoms at a glance ;-is not your eye sufficiently practiced ?"&#xD;
asked he, with ~a curling lip.&#xD;
"No, sir. I regret to say that the gentlemen of my acquaint-&#xD;
ance are not sentimental~ or polite enough, to get up such scenes."&#xD;
"I have no doubt you do deplore it."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Holmes !" ejaculated Ellen, with her gleeful&#xD;
laugh; "how ungallant !"&#xD;
"You mistake. It was a skilful cox~i1ination of veracity and&#xD;
politeness. I must coincide with her, and am pleased that it&#xD;
can be done without v~ole~ice to my conscience. I wish I could&#xD;
propose a cure for the evil you lament, Mis8 Read, but I am&#xD;
afraid it is irremediable. Men are obstinate animals."&#xD;
Ida, alarmed, touched his foot;' and the lynx eyes saw, the&#xD;
slight movement. A deadly light glowed there for an instant,&#xD;
az~d was extinguished in softness, as she assailed Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"'In what far distant region of the kall.'&#xD;
ht~ve you kept yourself all the evening, Sir Truant ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
'N&#xD;
&#xD;
"Polyhynxnia and Melpomene 1" muttered Lynn.&#xD;
"I have been a fixture in this room most of the time;" replied&#xD;
Morton.&#xD;
"How selfish! had you n~ sense of duty? could you not&#xD;
sacri~ce your ease to secure th~ enjoyment of.' your friends ?"&#xD;
"It would argue ridiculous vanity in me, to suppose~ that my&#xD;
absence has detracted from the pleasures of the assembly; and&#xD;
from the aspirants for the smile of the reigning belles, so unim-&#xD;
portant a personage is not missed."&#xD;
"Can he like her 7" thought Ida. "There is still an air&#xD;
unlike other men, but he does not act or speak as he did to me.&#xD;
H~ looks amused but very careless. Oh! why must we have&#xD;
two faces ?"&#xD;
"Why did you stop me just now ?" queried Lynn, pettishly.&#xD;
"I do not fear her; I am rather anxious she should know the&#xD;
extent of my dislike~"&#xD;
"How' will that benefit either of you ?" inquired Ida.&#xD;
"Don't play the saint! much consideration you owe her! 'I&#xD;
am a good hater :-I cannot fawn and smile upon one,-~-woman&#xD;
though she is-beggared in principle and heart. She is capable&#xD;
of anything. Mean and tyrannical-those who deal with her,&#xD;
~must be tools or enemies,-I choose the latter alterna live. I&#xD;
will not hear any justification. Don't Lknow-cannot everybody&#xD;
see) that she is the trouble of your life,-that she would murder&#xD;
you, but for the cowardly dread of detection !"&#xD;
"You will counsel me next, to sleep with pistols under my&#xD;
pillow ;" said she. "What an array of horrors you are manu-&#xD;
facturing ?"&#xD;
"It is as true as Gospel. Why disclaim it? Charley 'told&#xD;
me of the vixen before I saw her; he can ~be civil~-I cannot--&#xD;
and what is more-will not'!"&#xD;
"He sees, perhaps, that animosity to my friends may be an&#xD;
engine to inflict suffering upon me ;" answered Ida, thinking of&#xD;
Mr.. Dermott.&#xD;
Lynn coloured. "He' intimated as much. I have not his&#xD;
self-command; he is a better, because a more unselfish friend&#xD;
than I."&#xD;
"I have nb fault to' find with you ;" was the reply. "It is a&#xD;

&#xD;
Charley ~was leaning upon the back of her chair, and this&#xD;
remark was made partly to him. Lynn pressed her hand, as he&#xD;
recovered hin~elf from his lowly posture, but there was as much&#xD;
meanu~g in the kind gaze of his undemonstrative friend. Their&#xD;
affection was a nil of pure water, stealing through a region of&#xD;
artificial light and bloom; and people pretended to, or did mis-&#xD;
interpret it. JQsephine credited, doubted, and was impatient by&#xD;
turns. One of them was the lover ;-.--they were too friendly to&#xD;
be bound upon the same errand. Lynn's manner was most&#xD;
iinequivocal-.-.but his attentions to' Ellen! Charley was not a&#xD;
marrying man-~-that was settled-everybody said; but the ten.&#xD;
der respect he paid Ida; t~ie watchfulness that protected her&#xD;
from impenthience and 7negieot, were weighty offsets to this&#xD;
popiala~decision ;-and again, opposed to these were his dis-&#xD;
interestedness in surrendering his post to Lynn, or any agreeable&#xD;
companion, who sought it; and the absence of uneasiness in his&#xD;
observation of her belleship.4,&#xD;
Ida' laughed at her mystification~ as did those who effected it,&#xD;
...-frequently concerting some manoeuvre, by which to lead her&#xD;
further into the labyrinth.. If Charley made one of the family&#xD;
in the evening, the morrow brought Lynn to drive or 'walk.&#xD;
Charley lent her books, an~ imported a writing-desk from Paris,&#xD;
upon hearing Mrs. Dana ~say that Ida had made a fruitless&#xD;

Lynn appeared to have lai~i down the brush for the spade and&#xD;

Holmes' compliments; and .the* walls of her chamber were&#xD;
adorned with pictures, from subjects proposed or approved by&#xD;
her. But amidst the frolicsome action of this drama, was col-&#xD;

danced and sang and sported, unaware of the importance of the&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
IT had been predicted from the premature beginning of the&#xD;
winter's gaieties, that an ebb would occur, before the Southern&#xD;
carnival, Christmas, and the party-goers resolved to. falsi4 the&#xD;
prophecy.&#xD;
Mrs. Dana called on the afternoon of the 24th to invite Ida&#xD;
and Josephine to dine with her. "You will see only ourselves&#xD;
and Mr. Holmes, who is Charley's shadow."&#xD;
"A stupid set," was Josephine's reflection. "How pleasant,"&#xD;
Ida's; and their ideas corresponded. The former, "very sorry,&#xD;
papa would always dine at home, Christmas-day; he held it to&#xD;
be a religious she verily believed," laughing affectedly, "and&#xD;
he could not eat unless she were there."&#xD;
Ida said, '(I will come with pleasure, thank you,". and lost&#xD;
all but the main purport of Miss Read's apology, in an eager&#xD;
whisper from Elle, who was with her mother.&#xD;
"I don't hear, will I 'please come t~ what?' lifting her to her&#xD;
lap.&#xD;
Elle put her arms around her neck, and her mouth to her&#xD;
ear.&#xD;
"To your molasses stew 1" said Ida, "indeed' I will. Wheu,&#xD;
is it to be ?"&#xD;
Another important whisper. to-morrow'&#xD;

&#xD;
"I hope not," said Mrs. Dana. "Elle's head is full of her&#xD;
frolic. I was describing to her the molasses stew I had every&#xD;
Christmas, when I 'was a child, and nothing would do but I must&#xD;
promise her one for 'being a good girl.'"&#xD;
"She deserves it, I 'know," said Ida, fondly. "I will&#xD;
Elle, jf I leave fifty grown people's parties."   come,&#xD;
"Will you, too 7" asked the child, going up to Josephine.&#xD;
NRIrs. Dana pressed the invitation,&#xD;
"I am not certain, but I have engaged to go somewhere else,&#xD;
'said Josephine, smiling heartlessly into the pure little face. "If&#xD;
IcanIwiIi do myself the honor, Miss Dana."&#xD;
The wretched attempt at playfulness actually frightened Elle,&#xD;
who shrunk again to the 8ide of h~er friend.&#xD;
"Are you serious in promising to go to this babyish fal-lal ?"&#xD;
snapped Josephine, the minute Mrs. Dana was gone.&#xD;
"Did not you hear that Anna Talbot is to receive company&#xD;
to-morrow night ?"&#xD;
"Yes; and I am rejoiced that Elle's invitation was earliest.&#xD;
There are Anna and Ellen Morris."&#xD;
"I haven't time to stay," exclaimed the young lady, throwing&#xD;
herself upon the sofa. "You both must spend a~ociable even-&#xD;
ing with \me-~a Christmas jubilee-.egg-nogg, country-dances,&#xD;
etc. We \ar~to have a high time. You are disengaged ?"&#xD;
"I ~ said Josephine, promptly, "and if I were not, I&#xD;
could not ~resist the temptation to send a 'regret,' and go to&#xD;
your house."&#xD;
" Thank you-.and you, Ida--may I count upon you both 7"&#xD;
drawing up her cloak. Ida declined courteously ;-"-" she was&#xD;
engaged to Mrs. Dana.":&#xD;
"Oh !" b~gan Anna, disappointed.&#xD;
"Is it not ~oo silly ?" interposed Josephine. "It is a child's&#xD;
~a~ty~.-.a molasses stew-think of it !"&#xD;
" You are joking, Ida," said Ellen, "excuse yourself to Efle&#xD;
.....~ want you !"&#xD;
"Not as mach as my little Cousin does. I cannot break my&#xD;
wordto her."&#xD;
"Little cousin !" smiled Anna. "I thought the relationship&#xD;
was closer. I will not give up the hope of persuading you.&#xD;
&#xD;
The nicest beaux in town are to be there-.Mr. Thornton, Mr.&#xD;
litus elI, and Mr. Villet, and Mr. Lacy; and a score more-do&#xD;

" cannot I" said Ida, with a pang.&#xD;
" apa will not he pleased with our going out separately ;"&#xD;
said osephine, that night.&#xD;
" e does not object to my going to Mr. Dana's alone ;" was&#xD;
the spouse.&#xD;
" thinking of number one, as usual, my amiable I~dy! I tell&#xD;
you hat! I shall not demean myself, by playing 'puss-in-the-&#xD;
corn r, and smearing my hands with treacle, when I might be&#xD;
at Mr. Talbot's, in decent company."&#xD;
"As you like. If you represent the character of the come&#xD;
pany to your father, he will probably insist upon your mixing&#xD;
with them."&#xD;
"He! he I" tittered Rachel, who was in waiting. Josephine&#xD;
flounced out of the room.&#xD;
"Christmas gift, Miss Ida !" Her maid stood at her bedside,&#xD;
in the grey morning light. "Ch~ristmas gift 1" called out the&#xD;
passers-by, as they encountered each other in the street. "Hur-&#xD;
rah~ for Christmas !" shouted squads of boys, at the corner, to a&#xD;
brilliant accompaniment of pop-crackers.'&#xD;
Ida heard it all, with a spirit out of tune' with mirth. No&#xD;
gifts were prepared for her; the Thanksgiving-day was one of&#xD;
mourning to the homeless. She had anticipated a visit froni&#xD;
Carry, during the~holidays; but her last letter had dashed the&#xD;
hope.' "Mammy was recovering from a severe fit of sickness,&#xD;
and she would not leave her. Ida wished she were not to dine at&#xD;
Mr. Dana's, she was not fit for society, and sad enough, withoi3t&#xD;
the sight of joys, which reminded, her of her losses and wants.&#xD;
In this discontented mood, she went down stairs. No Christmas&#xD;
yet! Mr. Read grunted to her formal bow, and Josephine said&#xD;
"the coffee was cold-it had been on the table so long." Mr.&#xD;
Read finished his second cup, and pulled out his pocket-book.&#xD;
"People will be asking if I made you a present. Thank&#xD;
goodness! Christmas comes but once a year. Two would break&#xD;

plate.&#xD;
"No, sir! I have money of my-.-" but he did not wait to hear&#xD;
her through. As she quitted the table, Josephine pointed to&#xD;
the untouched" present."&#xD;
"Take it, if you choose 1" said Ida, contemptuously. "I am&#xD;
ziot a dependaut or a beggar I"&#xD;
Josephine loved money, and pocketed it. "And the old cur~&#xD;
mudgeon is none the wiser I"" chuckled the dutiful daughter.&#xD;
Ida stretched herself upon a lounge, and set seriously about&#xD;
reasoning herself out of her despondency. She thought of Carry,&#xD;
and Lynn and Charley; but they came reluctantly, with selfishly&#xD;
happy faces; with their schemes and amusements and dearer&#xD;
friends. Mr. and Mrs. Dana pitied her ;-this was the spring&#xD;
of their kindness! and her haughty soul winced at the idea.&#xD;
Hope and Fancy crept, with trailing wings, into hiding-places&#xD;
until the sun should shine out-she sullenly hugged her misery.&#xD;
What visionary who reads this, but has suffered from these.&#xD;
morhose fits?&#xD;
."Well ?" said she, tartly, as Rachel tiptoed across the floor.&#xD;
"I thought you was asleep ;" replied the sable damsel.&#xD;
"Lam awak o you. want anything ?"&#xD;
RaohelI~ubbed r chin, gave her turban a twitch, and fumbled&#xD;
in her pocket., " Law! I aint lost it, I know! It must be in&#xD;

I~la, awakened by her movements, watched her as she pro..&#xD;
duced a tiny packet from the last~mentioned receptacle, With&#xD;
an odd compound of awkwardness and affection, she slipped a&#xD;
ring u~on her mistress' finger.&#xD;
"Thar! it fits I don't it ?" intensely complacent.&#xD;
"But *here did you get it, Rachel? is it for me ?"&#xD;
"For you,. and nobody else, Miss Ida. I was determined&#xD;

and thar 'tis-....wishiu' you a Merry Christmas, and an ever-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing courtesy. Ida tried to smile at her peroration, and failing,&#xD;
burst into tears. Rachel was transfixed. She was not used to&#xD;
hysterics, and had never seen her mistress weep before. flier&#xD;
~onsternation was a speedy restorative; and Idafinally made her&#xD;
sensible that she was not grieved or displeased, but overjoyed at&#xD;
her gift. Then the voluble Abigail recollected" something' else"&#xD;
she had, to communicate.&#xD;
"Aint that tall gentleman, with black whiskers, that visits&#xD;
here so constant, named Mr. Lacy ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I thought so. When I went into the jewellerer's he was a,&#xD;
standing' at the counter, buyin' a pair of gold spectacles-for his&#xD;
mother~-I reckon. I heard him say they was for a lady. I&#xD;
asked for the rings, and the shop-boy gave me a string of brassy,&#xD;
ugly things-and says I-' I want a handsome one, sir, for my&#xD;
uiistis.'&#xD;
"'Your mistis!' says he. 'Them's plenty good for her!'&#xD;
"'Are these the best you. have?' 'says Mr. Lacy, sort o'&#xD;
frowning' and talking' like he was his master fifty times over.&#xD;
"'No, sir-would you like to see some?' says the boy, turning'&#xD;
white.&#xD;
"'Bring thei~x I' says Mi;. Lacey; and when they come, he&#xD;
told me, with the sweetest smile, and so respectful! 'These cost&#xD;
a great deal of money-do you know it?' So I showed him&#xD;
what I had, and he said wouldd do. Bimeby, I picked out two,&#xD;
and could not tell which was the prettiest. I kept a-lookin' at&#xD;
one, and then at 'to~her, and says he, 'Can't you choose between&#xD;
them?'&#xD;
"'No, sir,' says It.&#xD;
"' I think that t~ie handsomest;' says he, pintin' to one, and&#xD;
that's it you've got on your finger, this minute, Miss Ida. He&#xD;
seed that low-lived boy give me the right change, and when I&#xD;
curchyed and said, 'I'm mightily obliged to you, sir;' he said,&#xD;
are welcome,' just like I'd been the Governor! We&#xD;
colored folks know a gentleman when we see him, and he is a&#xD;
real born one.~~&#xD;
The ring was very~ elegant, and the blood~ mounted to Ida's&#xD;
temple's, as ~he toyed with it.&#xD;
"Perhaps, it was not Mr. Lacy ?" said she, in a tone of&#xD;

extreme indifference. "Where had you met him, that you&#xD;
know him ?" -&#xD;
"I never met him nowliar. I seed him one Sunday, when&#xD;
he walked home with you from church, and I ~as at the upstairs&#xD;
window, and once through the dinin'-room door .when he was&#xD;
here to skipper, and once--through the parlor window."&#xD;
"'Peeping! Rachel! If he had seen you, he. would not think&#xD;
as highly of your manners, as you do of his."&#xD;
"Peeping! Law! Miss Ida, them was sly glimpses, permis-&#xD;
cuous-like, you know. lie wasn't a-gwine to catch me."&#xD;
A longer inspection of the ring. There was no blush this&#xD;
time, b~~t the smile was happier. The motive was then as pure&#xD;
as the action was generous. The little shower had purified the&#xD;
murky atmosphere. This token of remembrance, at a moment&#xD;
when she believed herself forgotten, was none the less dear that&#xD;
the donor was a poor slave. It was the fruit of self-denying&#xD;
affection; and had no ftooner clasped her finger, than it acted as&#xD;
the Open Sesame to a stoi~-house of untold riches. "It has&#xD;
taught me more than ~ne lesson," she murmured.&#xD;
Rachel was garruloi~sly happy.&#xD;
"I do-clar, Miss Ida, you've been getting' prettier ever since I&#xD;
come in ;" said she, standing off, to survey the effect of her&#xD;
toilette. "I hope thar~ll be a crowd at Mars' John's. Is it a&#xD;
dinin'-day?"&#xD;
"Nt-a family party."&#xD;
"That's a pity! I 'spect thar' another present! It never&#xD;
rains but it pours."&#xD;
The footman said Mr. Dana was below. Charley waited to&#xD;
escort her to his brother's; and Ida egan to realize, as he paid&#xD;
the compliments of the season, in a style, eminently "Char-&#xD;
leyish,"-that Christmas had indeed come.&#xD;
"Christmas gift! Christmas gift! cousin Ida," shouted two&#xD;
infantine voices; and Charley the less, and Elle scampered&#xD;
down the porch-steps to salute her. "Now mamma! now or&#xD;
the tree! She is here !"&#xD;
"Oh! Mrs. Dana! have not they seen ~thefr tree? What&#xD;
Suspense for the dear creatures !"&#xD;
"It was their wish; and their father would not consent ~at&#xD;
the door should be unlocked until the family were assembled.'&#xD;

"Here is the last straggler 1" exclaimed Lynn, springing&#xD;
into the group, shaking hands with his friends, and kissing the&#xD;
children. "We are all here 1"&#xD;
At a given signal, the door of the mysterious room was un~&#xD;
folded, and revealed the tree; its precious load glittering and&#xD;
gay in the clear winter day. Headed by "papa," and closed-&#xD;
by the nurse and baby, the procession performed a circuit, and&#xD;
then formed a ring. Uncle Charley was distributor; aceo~n-&#xD;
panying each gift by an appropriate remark. For. Ida, there&#xD;
were a pair of ear-rings from John Dana; a bracelet of fair&#xD;
hair, which did not require the simple "Carry" upon the&#xD;
chased clasp, to signify from whose brow it had been shorn;&#xD;
a handsomely-bound edition of Shelly's works--Lynn's taste;&#xD;
Charley gave a card case, a Chinese curiosity, and evaded her&#xD;
thanks and praises by pointing out a resemblance in th~ most ~x&#xD;
grotesque figue, carved thereupon, himself, a circumstance, which&#xD;
he protested, induced him to select it. Among the white bud&amp;amp;&#xD;
of a perpetual rose-tree, hung a card-" Elle and Charley to&#xD;
their dear cousin ;" and Mrs. Dana finished the list with a rose-&#xD;
wood work-box, supplied with every implement of female&#xD;
industry.&#xD;
"Ills this being friendless 7" asked Ida, inly, looking at her&#xD;
acquisitions~ "For the rest of the day, I will be grateful. and&#xD;
contented."&#xD;
The morning was spent in the nursery. On Christmas day,&#xD;
its door could not bar intruders; there were no men or women;&#xD;
all were children, Charley whipped his namesake's top; rocked&#xD;
the cradle; and instructed Elle in domestic economy~ as he&#xD;
helped arrange her baby-house. The dinner-bell, rung an hour&#xD;
earlier than usual, on account of the wee ones taking thatmeal&#xD;
with the "big folks," was faintly heard in the din of' a famous&#xD;
game of romps. The afternoon was less noisy; the children&#xD;
fell. asleep, wearied with frolic; the gentlemen walked out; Mrs.&#xD;
Dana was busy; and so it was, that Ida sat alone in the&#xD;
drawing-room, at nightfall, watching- the passing of the pink&#xD;
light from the clouds, and thinking-" Everything to gladden&#xD;
me, and yet ill at ease I murmuring soul, be still I" And then&#xD;
she wished for the society of a calmer mind, that should speak&#xD;
peace to the hearings of her unquiet spirit; for the compre-&#xD;

hensive charity, the benign philosophy, which hoped for the best,&#xD;
and argued for the right~-.this was her version of the outgoing&#xD;
of the woman's heart-" Would he were here I"&#xD;
But Elle's friends caine early, and she had no time for higher&#xD;
thoughts than filling small mouths with bread and butter-.&#xD;
"run-the-thimble," the vexed question of "how many miles&#xD;
to Babylon ;" and "Chicken-me-chicken~me.eraney.crow ;" pas~&#xD;
times, whose barbarous names cause the refined juveniles of this&#xD;
precocious 58, to join~their gloved hands in thanksgiving, that&#xD;
their lot was not cast in those times! As the dignified master&#xD;
of the house deigned to participat~ in the ceremonies, we trust&#xD;
our heroine will not suffer a very grievous letting-down in the&#xD;
Opinion of these formidable critics, for the prominent parts she&#xD;
assumed. A circle was ordered for "Fox and goose." Charley&#xD;
played Reynard, and Ida, goose the first. The children enjoyed,&#xD;
without fuIl~ understanding the game, and she had to keep the&#xD;
character longer than the laws prescribed. Round and round&#xD;
they fiew-circling and doubling--the spectators screaming their&#xD;
applause-and she ran directly against a gentlemen who was&#xD;
entering. 'Her impetus was such that she would have fallen,'&#xD;
but foi, his extended arm. A laughing voice said something,&#xD;
unintelligible in her confusion.&#xD;
Oh I Mr. Lacy I" cried Elle. "I' was so afraid you wouldn't&#xD;
conie I"&#xD;
* "I promised-~did I not ?" said he, stooping t~ kiss her.&#xD;
"'Yes, sir, but~ I thought maybe ybu'd rather go to Miss&#xD;
Anna Taibot's party, like Miss-..."&#xD;
Elle I X1~lle! no, no I" whispered Ida, in time to suppress the&#xD;
name.&#xD;
"You see I had rather be at yours ;" he returned, without&#xD;
'noticing the unfinished' sentence. "What are you~ playing ?"&#xD;
"'Did you ever see a wild goose&#xD;
Bailing on the ocean?"'&#xD;
sang, Charley.&#xD;
~C The wild goose's motion&#xD;
Was a mighty Lunny nodon.'"&#xD;
he added~ aside to Ida.&#xD;
No forced spirits now! The innocent fun-the converse of&#xD;
the' social circle, after the little ones had gone-.-...the wal1~ home,&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
beneath the tremulous stars--the "good night" and pressure,&#xD;
whose thrill lingered in her fingers 'till sleep sealed her eyes~-&#xD;
all were sources of unutterable pleasure-ple~sures born from&#xD;
one influer.ice-flowing from one presence.&#xD;
A mouth later, Jose~hine returned from an evening concert,&#xD;
with a violent toothache~ the consequence of the sudden transitipn&#xD;
from they steaming hall to the ice-cold air without. She tossed&#xD;
and groaned in agony through the night; by morning the pain&#xD;
abated, a relief for which she was wickedly ungrateful, when she&#xD;
beheld reflected in the mirror, a tumefaction of the cheek, nearly&#xD;
closing one eye, and otherwise marring the symmetry of her&#xD;
features. The pain came back at intervals during the day;&#xD;
and with fretfulness, threw her into a fever. Dr. Ballard was&#xD;
sent for. It was late in the evening when she awoke from the&#xD;
slumber, gained by the anodyne he administered. The rain was&#xD;
plashing against the window; there was no other sound except&#xD;
a subdued murmur of distant voices. There were visitors in the&#xD;
parlor-who had ventured through the storm? Her sharpened&#xD;
senses caught manly tones-tones she thought she recognized;&#xD;
and then Ida's rippling, joyous laugh smote her unwilling ear-&#xD;
The conversation became lower and more serious; and she&#xD;
could endure no more. Unmindful of health and. prudence, she&#xD;
hurried on a dressing-gown, wrapped a shawl about her head,&#xD;
and glided down stairs, as stealthily as a cat. The front room&#xD;
only was warmed and lighted, but the folding-doors were ajar.&#xD;
Mr. Lacy stood by the, mantel, hat it hand, yet in no' hurry to&#xD;
depart., He was playing with a rosebud he had plucked from a&#xD;
vase near, but as unconscious of its beauty as of the lateness of the&#xD;
hour~ The expression with which he regarded the earnest speaker&#xD;
before him was not to be mistaken. It even seemed that ho&#xD;
would have it understood, for a proud smile trembled over his&#xD;
mouth as her eye avoided his.&#xD;
Josephine felt turned to stone. By a singular fatality, she&#xD;
had, up to, this time, remained ignorant of the growing intimacy&#xD;
between these two. We have seen that many of their inter-&#xD;
views were unknown to her although some~of thez~ occurr~&amp;amp;in&#xD;
her very presence; and Ida, in obedience to Lynn's cautioned&#xD;
guarded against any appearance of 'rivalship. Now, jealousy,&#xD;
and perception awoke together-at one sweeljing glance back'.&#xD;

ward, she saw herself slighted.-foiled---duped! and' she grew&#xD;
faint at the' sight of the frightful results of her lack of vigilance;&#xD;
which rushed overwhelmingly upon her mind. Her native&#xD;
shrewdness soon came to her aid. Matters were not so despe~&#xD;
r4te. There was no 'word~of love;-she breathed more freely.&#xD;
"Not yet! not yet 1" she hissed, under her breath ;-~and the&#xD;
small hands clenched in passionate , resolve, as she added-&#xD;
"never !" The leave-taking was full Qf feeling, but friends /&#xD;
parted as kindly. 'The outer door clanged to; and Ida sank into&#xD;
her chair. Buried in the cushions, she sat, looking into the&#xD;
blaze, a smile of ineffable tenderness illumining her face; her&#xD;
cheeks bright with unwanted scarlet. The patter of the rain -&#xD;
upon the panes but lulled her into deeper reverie. And in con.&#xD;
trast to a foreground so rich and Warm, in its glowing colors and&#xD;
balmy air, and dreams of love and hope-was the dark chill&#xD;
background, with its shape of evil, hideous in her distorted fea-&#xD;
tures and glowering hatred. Ida stooped suddenly. It was to&#xD;
pick ~up the bruised bud Morton. had dropped. She looked&#xD;
around~, hurriedly, and with a more vivid blush, raised it to her&#xD;
'lips, and hid it~ in her bosom.&#xD;
"Rose-buds arS not the only things which are played with for&#xD;
a time, then trampled under foot, as you shall learn ere long,&#xD;
my love-loin damsel !" said the wily schemer, stealing back to&#xD;
her chamber.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.'&#xD;
KOTHING appeared less likely, at this period, than the fulfil-&#xD;
ment of Lynn's prognostications of his destiny. He collected&#xD;
encouragement 'and praise at every turn. A Bayt~rd in society-.-.&#xD;
* a Raphael at the easel, he bore a distinguished part in the lioni-&#xD;
zation '6f the day.'' lie sped well, too, in his wooing. A quick&#xD;
ft~ney:and impressible heart could hardly resist 'the attractions&#xD;
of his person and~ genius; and the spice of coquetry, generally&#xD;
predomip~nt in Ellen's 'disposition, lay dormant, as she heark-&#xD;
ened to the voice of love. She made but one reservation in&#xD;
&#xD;
pledging him her troth-that their engagement should be secret.&#xD;
He woiAd have had it proclaimed through the land-he so joyed&#xD;
in the bliss he had won; but he bowed to the scarcely uttered&#xD;
wish,. respecting the maiden modesty that dictated the request.&#xD;
To Ida and Charley it was divulged. He would not accept a&#xD;
happiness they were forbidden to share. For a few brief weeks&#xD;
this knew no shade or diminution; but a change came. Ida&#xD;
discovered it; but he was silent, and she would not extort con-&#xD;
fidence. It was a trial to see his. clouded countenance and fitful&#xD;
spirits; yet she knew his peculiarly sensitive organization, and&#xD;
hoped the evil was magnified by its medium. In this hope she&#xD;
finally persuaded him to speak.&#xD;
They met at a Fancy Fair. Ida was in an empowered recess,&#xD;
Mr. Lacy for a companion, and Charley hanging around to play&#xD;
propriety. Lynn entered alone, and did not attach himself to&#xD;
any person or party. He marched from end to end of the room,&#xD;
with folded arms, and a dogged look, too foreign to him, not to&#xD;
impress one uiipleasantly.' He perceived Ida after awhile, and&#xD;
acknowledged her presence by touching his hat, with no loss of&#xD;
gloominess. Ida was distrait; even Mr. Lacy failed to charm;&#xD;
and he was aware of it. He guessed, too, from the direction of&#xD;
her eyes, the working of her thoughts, and proposed a visit to&#xD;
the refreshment table, which stood in the path of the prome-&#xD;
*naders. , Lynn could not brush by without speaking. The first&#xD;
tone of Ida's voice affected him. The dull black of his eyes&#xD;
became lustrous, and the long lashes fell over them to conceal&#xD;
the momentary weakness. She would not let hiux go. She&#xD;
asked him questions without number or meaning, not waiting for&#xD;
answers, until 'she had eaten her ice; when she gave her glass&#xD;
to Mr. Lacy, and with an apology, his eye said was unnecessary,&#xD;
took Lynn's arm. He confessed all, as she had determined he&#xD;
should. It was a common tale; the scrupulousness ~of a love,&#xD;
made up of delicacy and truth, and the thoughtless trifling of a&#xD;
girl who felt her power ;-so she explained it, but the young&#xD;
lovqr mourned the death of his first-born hope.&#xD;
"I would as soon speak lightly of my dead sister, as tamper&#xD;
with her affections," said he. "Your excuse that she does these&#xD;
things to try mine-if you are right-proves that she never&#xD;
loved me."&#xD;

"jBut why did I say she applied the test? In girlish~caprice&#xD;
-foolish enough-..-.-but harmless as to intention. Have you for-&#xD;
gotten what women are in their 'hour ~f ease?' if danger or&#xD;
sorrow menaced you, she would stand by you to the last. She&#xD;
loves you, Lynn,--I am assured of this."&#xD;
"Not so am I. I called there this evening. She had pro-&#xD;
mised to accompany me hither, but she was 'engaged with com-&#xD;
pany!' Those ad~lepates, Pemberton and Talbot were' there,&#xD;
doling out their ser~seless prattle; and she was gracious to them,&#xD;
repeflant to me. I~ Peniberton were not a puppy, I would~ not&#xD;
sleep before I crossed swords with him. She waltzed with him&#xD;
last night. I had told her that I would not invite any lady,&#xD;
whom I respected, to engage in that most disgusting of dances.&#xD;
Conceive of my feelings, when, within the hour, I saw her whirl-&#xD;

impudence! if he thwarts me again, I will cane him 1"&#xD;
"You will not! Go and see Ellen to-morrow, when there is&#xD;
no one to annoy you, by Preventing a private interview. Set&#xD;

her conduct; assert your rights with' dignity, and your resolu-&#xD;

"I ~would not pain her, Ida. She has chosen the easiest&#xD;
method of undeceiving ~me; better this, than a~ life-time of&#xD;
misery to both., She. said, the other day, to a gentle reproach&#xD;
~ for an open slight, which would have offended a vainer man,&#xD;
mortally, that she did It to mislead others. 'A young lady,'&#xD;
she remarked, 'sinks into a cypher, if it is suspected that she&#xD;
is betrothed. I have not had my lawful amount of admiration&#xD;
yet.'"&#xD;
"'Ellen!' said I, 'I have loved you as man never loved&#xD;
women before; have believed you pure and high-minded. If I&#xD;
thought that the despicable coquetry you~ insinuate, caused you~&#xD;
to insist upQn the concealment of our ~ngagement, I would&#xD;
trumpet it to the world, and 'then break itj myself!"'&#xD;
'~ Lynn, remember where you are! You are too harsh; it was&#xD;
a jest."&#xD;
"The manner displeased inc most, and to-night, when I saw&#xD;
those fops-~-.~could I be patient ?"&#xD;
Their couversation and saunter were prolonged.&#xD;

"Are you going home to-night ?" asked Josephine, gaily,&#xD;
hailing them in one of their rounds. "'They are extinguishing&#xD;
the lamps."&#xD;
Ida changed color as she saw that she had Mr. Lacy's arm.&#xD;
Lynn observed it, and waited for her.&#xD;
As ar~ fast walkers-go on," said Josephine, at the door.&#xD;
they passed, Ida had a view of Mr.. Lacy's features. They&#xD;
were so pale and' rigid, that she started. He answered her look&#xD;
of apprehension with one that froze her blood.&#xD;
What had she done to draw down that stern, yet sorrowful&#xD;
rebuke?&#xD;
~" The look you wear&#xD;
A heart may heal or break."&#xD;
Her pillow was damp that night.&#xD;
Mr. Thornton had obtained a signal victory in his first import-&#xD;
ant cause. Already, his legal acumen and oratorical powers&#xD;
marked him in the public eye for usefulness and fame and on&#xD;
the evening after the delivery of the verdict, he called together&#xD;
a band of select spirits to rejoice with him. The banquet was&#xD;
well ordered; comprising the rarities of the season, and a variety&#xD;
of wines, varied by the introduction of agreeable non-intoxicants,&#xD;
coffee, tea, iced sherbet, etc. These unwanted accompaniments of&#xD;
a bachelor supper were looked upon with an evil eye bysome of&#xD;
the guests. They were jealous of innovations which might end in&#xD;
puritanical abstinence; and their fears were further excited that&#xD;
three of their small number preferred the less stimulating beve-&#xD;
rages. That Mr. Lacy's example should be copied by' Mr. Coxnp-&#xD;
ton, a fellow-student, was not surprising, as they were intimate,&#xD;
and known as members of the same church; but at Charles&#xD;
Dana's rejection of the social glass, there was a hum of excia.&#xD;
nation~ and inquiries, which was calmed by his imperturbability,&#xD;
and the polite tact of the host. Morton could not unriddle the&#xD;
conduct of his friend, for he knew that his most trivial action&#xD;
was not meaningless. "Not a convert, Charley ?" he said, when&#xD;
* he rest werein full cry after some inspiring subject.'&#xD;
"Unfortunately, no. It is from a motive of expediency that&#xD;
I. abstain to-night."&#xD;
They sat together, and a~ he spoke, Mr. Lacy chanced to&#xD;
remark Lynn, who was opposite. He drank deeply, but his&#xD;

potations had not had time. to ignite the fire that burned in his&#xD;
eyes and cheeks. 1~Iis talk was a volcanic eloquence, reckless as&#xD;
to course and consequence;. and his laugh had the peal of a&#xD;
maniac's yell. In real alarm, Morton, turned to his neighbor.&#xD;
Charley was on the alert; not ontwardly-he knight have been&#xD;
more grave and taciturn than common, but there were no evi-&#xD;
dences of anxiety. Morton divined his feelings, by a glance he&#xD;
saw exchanged between him* and -his heated friend; a look of&#xD;
warning and appeal on one side,-of a~n~uish, scornful in its&#xD;
bitterness, on the other,-and the torrent i~olled on as before;&#xD;
During the giving of toasts, Mr. Lacy a~idCharley fell into a&#xD;
quiet chat, only pausing to lift their glasses in courtesy to the&#xD;
authors, ignorant, most of the time, of the sentiment proposed.&#xD;
Lynn was more sedate; from delirium he was relapsing into a&#xD;
comatose state, when he was brought to his feet by a toast to his&#xD;
art, coupled with a neatly turned compliment to himself; .±~om&#xD;
Mr. Thornton. His unpremeditated reply was beautiful and&#xD;
touching. He was under the very spur of genius; rich meta-&#xD;
phors, apt classical allusions, and delicate pathos poured from&#xD;
his lips, as thoughts from his brain; his rapt hearers scarcely&#xD;
conscious that he employed the machinery of words. The&#xD;
applause that succeeded the last musical echo was deafening.&#xD;
'For a moment, the 'wild gh~re that had distressed Morton, dis-&#xD;
appeared, and 'with a happy, grateful smile, J~ie bowed his thanks&#xD;
for this spontaneous tribute of approbation a~d regard.&#xD;
"Egad 1" said Pemberton, "you have mistaken your calling,&#xD;
Holme~-you had better burn up your canvass, and -take to&#xD;
stump-speaking, you'd make more money by it."&#xD;
Angry frowns and rebuking eyes were directed to the drunken&#xD;
speaker.&#xD;
"If fitumps and blockheads claim kindred, I shall not need t~&#xD;
go far to exercise my vocation," said Lynn, hotly.&#xD;
"Ha! ha 1" laughed the other, - with a violent affectation of&#xD;
derision~&#xD;
"Don't be frightened, gentlemen I Mr. Holmes and myself&#xD;
have wrestled upon another battle-field, and I can afford to forgive -&#xD;
him, from the soreness of his defeat. Your friend and instruct..&#xD;
ress, that loud-tongued virago, Ida Ross, could not have&#xD;
uttered-.-"&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       179&#xD;
Like a wounded panther, Lynn cleared the table at a bound,&#xD;
and grasped his throat. A ge~ieral rush was made to the spot,&#xD;
and tI~ey were parted before either sustained serious injury.&#xD;
Pemberton had drawn a dirk at the attack, but it was wrested&#xD;
from him by Mr. Lacy. Reconciliation was impossible in the&#xD;
excited state of the combatants. Charley prudently withdrew&#xD;
his friend, relying upon time and reflection to prepare the mind&#xD;
of each for overtures and concessions. Lynn did not spei~k until&#xD;
they reached his room; then, extricating his arm from Charley's&#xD;
hold, he demanded in a high tone, what had been his object in&#xD;
terminating the conflict. "If not finished there, you know it&#xD;
must be somewhere."&#xD;
"I do not see the necessity," was the reply. "It is a drunken&#xD;
broil, of which you will be ashamed to-morrow. No man in his&#xD;
* senses would have noticed him a~ you did. lie shall have a&#xD;
cow-hiding for his last speech; I would not disgrace a more&#xD;
honorabi~ weapon by using it against him. I am mortified, Lynn&#xD;
.-I hoped you were learning to control those childish fits of&#xD;
passion.&#xD;
"Am I ~o be crossed and bellied forever by a meddling fool?&#xD;
Is it not enough that he has helped to wreck my peace, buthe&#xD;
must taunt me with it ?" cried, Lynn passionately. " He ought&#xD;
not to live, and I do not care to I"&#xD;
"You certainly are not fit to die." said Charley composedly,&#xD;
"or you would not rave so like a madman. Be sane for five&#xD;
minutes; by what me~ns has your happiness been put in his&#xD;
power ?"&#xD;
LyDn was a humored, wayward child; and this cold severity did&#xD;
more to quiet him than an hour's rhetorical pleading. Cliarley&#xD;
listened with knitting brows, to a rehearsal of his story to Ida,&#xD;
and an account of that day's interview with Ellen. Sh~ was&#xD;
dressed for a ride with Mr. Pemberton, and exasperate&amp;amp; by this&#xD;
new example of her disrespect to him in encouraging a man he&#xD;
despised-.Lynn had spoke hastily~-.-angrily. She retorted with&#xD;
equal warmth, and after a turbulent scene they parted. Pem.-&#xD;
berton arrived as he was leaving, and his malicious twinkle told&#xD;
that he comprehended auid enjoyed the 'affairs. Like&#xD;
Ida, Charley had never heartily approved of this natch ; but his&#xD;
indignation towards Ellen was none the less on this account. He&#xD;

saw, in her behaviour, the most culpable flirting, arid he said so&#xD;
to Leynn. ~Ie shook his head sadly.&#xD;
"Convince inc of that and you destroy my faith in woman.&#xD;
No! I believe she once ~fancied she loved me; but I have become&#xD;
obnoxious to her. It is my fate. The last dream of hope is&#xD;
over-I have nothing to live for now."&#xD;
* lie covered his face with his hands. Charley remained wid~&#xD;
him all night, an uninvited visitor. His host neglected him&#xD;
entirely, never spe2tking, and seemingly unmindful of hi~ pre-&#xD;
sence. Whenever Charley awoke, he heard him pacing the&#xD;
floor, or saw the outline of his figure, dark and, still, at the&#xD;
window, gazing into the blAck night.&#xD;
"You will not do anything iii the settlement of this nonsensi-&#xD;
cal matter until you confer with me ?" requested Pharley, on&#xD;
saying "Go9d bye."&#xD;
"I shall not move in the affair," was the laconic rejoinder.&#xD;
"You will acquaint me with Pemberton's proposals ?"&#xD;
"If I think proper-yes--you shall know in good time."&#xD;
Charley was going out, and did not catch the exact import of&#xD;
these words. He proceeded with the business of the da~, com-&#xD;
paratively at ease. Knowing Pemberton to be an arrant ~oward&#xD;
at heart,.bully as he was, he did not fear a renewal of tl~e sub-&#xD;
ject from him..&#xD;
Ida was alone - that evening Mr. Reed was in the country;&#xD;
and Josephine, having waited until visiting hours were over,&#xD;
went off to' bed. Ida liked -to sit up late, but she usually pre-&#xD;
ferred the snug comfort i~f her room to~ the parlors; To-night&#xD;
she lingered over a book, i~eading and musing, with a tincture of&#xD;
gl6oni in her t~ought-pie~ures. She was pondering upon the&#xD;
in~tab~lity of earthly plains ~and hopes. "How true that the&#xD;
brigheet light produces the deepest shadows!" The words arose&#xD;
unexpectedly to her lips. In the loosely-linked chain of reverie,&#xD;
she did not know that they had their origin in the memory of a&#xD;
slighter circumstance than a word-.-.in a look.&#xD;
Rachel was coming to see after her; and hearing a ring as she&#xD;
tripped by the front door, opened. it. A man handed her a&#xD;
package saying, briefly, "For Miss Ross," and instantly&#xD;
vanished. Ida saw Lynn's hand in the superscription of the&#xD;
bully parcel, and broke the seal. Two letters, were within it;&#xD;

one directed to Ellen Morris; the other,-enclosing a miniature&#xD;
.-to herself.&#xD;
"My best, truest friend I" she read, "I cannot trust myself&#xD;
to speak the farewell my heart indites to one who has been a&#xD;
loving and faithful sister to me. It would unman me, and I have&#xD;
occasion for al~ my manliness at this juncture. I have no regret&#xD;
in the prosPect of leaving a world where my horoscope was cast&#xD;
in clouds and storm ;-I cannot undergo the pangs of seeing&#xD;
your grief. Destiny will be accomplished, Ida, however, insig-&#xD;
nificant the instrument with which it works~ Charley will&#xD;
inform you. of the baseness of that which has severed the one.&#xD;
shining thread of my existence. Heaven grant you may never&#xD;
know the hatefulness of life, when that for which you. thought,&#xD;
toiled, lived, is torn from you I I have struck the reptile who&#xD;
trailed over my Eden-flowers, and reared his head insultingly&#xD;
amid the ruin he helped to effect, and. in his unspent malice he&#xD;
would sting me to death. The sting of death is gone! there will&#xD;
be unintentional mercy in the stroke that releases me. I have&#xD;
been mad-I am calmer now. If I know my 'own heart, I wish.&#xD;
him no evil; I shall not attempt his life-i will not imbrue my&#xD;
hands in the blood of the murdered.&#xD;
"You will give the enclosed to my poor Ellen-' my Ellen!'&#xD;
she has forbidden me to call her by that name. It may be, she&#xD;
will pity, when no more, the wretch she could not love when.&#xD;

"My sister and friend! what can I say to you? Forgive my&#xD;
.ingratiude in being willing to die before I have made some feeble&#xD;
return for your goodness! Will you wear or keep this image of&#xD;
him, by whom you were never forgotten-not in the death-&#xD;
agony? I have written to Charley, but . he will not receive the&#xD;
letter until all is over. I was unwilling to risk this-its con~&#xD;

stared upon her; the hour-.nearly midnight; the ilinessof their&#xD;
man-servant; Mr. Read's absence; her ignorance of Lynn's&#xD;
locality or plans beyond his suicidal intention-towered, frown-&#xD;
ing ~pectres, mountain-high, each with its sepulchral "Impos-&#xD;
Bible !" some ~women would have swooned-some sunk down&#xD;
to weep in in~potent despair ;-the shock over, her energetic&#xD;
spirit rallied to meet the emergency. He should be saved! at&#xD;
the peril of her life, if need be-what were personal convenience&#xD;
and safety?&#xD;
Charley-the sagacious, collected friend-what mortal could&#xD;
do, he would-she must see him. Rachel had not spoken, terri-&#xD;
fied by her mistress' expression and manner. It was a relief to&#xD;
aid her in any way;' she brought, without a second's parley, the&#xD;
cloak and hood Ida ordered, and equipped herself to attend her.&#xD;
"Ta~e* the key," said Ida, as they went. out of the door; and&#xD;
They ~ped on their way. The night was dark, and for whole&#xD;
squar~a not a light was visible. Half of the distance to Mr.&#xD;
Dana s was traversed without encountering a single being, when&#xD;
they approached a lighted door-way, in which two gentlemen&#xD;
were standing. Fearing to attract~ their attention by her hurried&#xD;
gait, Ida slackened her pace, and pulled her hood over her face.&#xD;
She heard one say-" If the spa~~s do not return he may not&#xD;
want watchers to-morrow night;" and a feeling of security stole&#xD;
upon her. The friends of the suffering would not molest her,&#xD;
whose mission was one of mercy. A few squares further on,&#xD;
they were met by a watchman. Rachel made out his badge of&#xD;
Mice through the obscurity, and pressed to her mistress' side&#xD;
The map~ stopped. His keen eye discerned ~her color.&#xD;
"Ypiii' pass 1" said he, confronting Rachel.&#xD;
ei~ mistress is with her," answered Id~, emboldened by the&#xD;
'~e bowed respectfully, and pursued his beat. Ida's heart&#xD;
throbbed loudly, but she stifled her fears by a reconsideration of&#xD;
Lynn's extremity of danger,-" it was no time for nervous fail-&#xD;
ings." Rachel did not possess such a tonic, and had seen every&#xD;
shadow, beard every rustle of the breeze.&#xD;
Before their adventure with the dreaded "guard," she bad&#xD;
known that one of the gentlemen above-mentioned had taken&#xD;
the same route with tli9mselves; keeping, however,'upon the&#xD;

other side of the street; and after Ida's ready response remove~1&#xD;
~her apprehension of "the cage" and Mayor's court, she saw him&#xD;
still upon her track-worse ! 'crossing towards them. Overcome&#xD;
with terror, she clutched her mistress' arm, and by a frantic&#xD;
gesture, directed her to the object of alarms He was within six&#xD;
feet of them; and startled by his proximity, and the fright of her&#xD;
attendant, she stood still. .~, minute of breathless suspense, a.id&#xD;
the stranger was at her side.&#xD;
"Miss Ross," he said, in' ~ low but confident tone. "This is&#xD;
a strange hour for a lady to \ be in the street with such attend-&#xD;
ance I".&#xD;
His stern, cold address coi4d not repress her thrilling pleasure.&#xD;
"Oh, Nir. Lacy !", she ejelaimed, clinging to his arm, and&#xD;
giving way, for the first time, to 'tears. "Life and death depend&#xD;
upon my action-the life of one very dear to us both-you would&#xD;
not reproach me if you knew-"&#xD;
"Ida! dear Ida 1" said he, mindful only of her sorrow. "Can&#xD;
there be reason for this excessive grief? Your fears have misled&#xD;
you. Of whom do you speak ?"&#xD;
She could not speak quite yet, but her sobs were subsiding&#xD;
under his soothing.&#xD;
"Will you not trust yourself and our friend to me, Ida ?"&#xD;
She looked up. "Yes," she said, simply.&#xD;
He put her hand within his arm. "First, tell me where you&#xD;
are going."&#xD;
"To Mr. Dana's."&#xD;
"For what purpose ?"&#xD;
"I have something to tell Charley."&#xD;
"I will be the bearer of your mes~age.~ Let' me see y~i home;&#xD;
-you shall give it to me on the way."&#xD;
She obeyed submissively as a child.&#xD;
"Now 1" said he, as they turned back.&#xD;
"I had a note from Lynn to-night. It is worded so ambi-&#xD;
guously,-contains so many allusions I do not understand, that&#xD;
I can glean but this-he has quarrelledand been~challenged ;-&#xD;
they fight to-morrow, where or when I do not know, nor the&#xD;
name of his opponent. It is all a horrible mystery."&#xD;
It was more clear to him. He related the incident of the&#xD;
altercation at supper, suppressing Peniberton's use of her nai~ie.&#xD;

he declares his solemn determination not to resist the attack.&#xD;
His life is thrown away !"&#xD;
"Not if man can prevent it-I promise you this much. When&#xD;
did you get this letter ?"&#xD;
"Not an hour since."&#xD;
"Why did' you not send to Charley or me 7"&#xD;
." Mr. Read is away, and John sick."&#xD;
"What is the tone of the note? revengeful 7"&#xD;
"Oh, no! he says expressly-' If I know, my own heart, I&#xD;

thought of getting rid of it."&#xD;
"'Getting rid' of the life God has bestowed !" repeated he,&#xD;
indignantly. ~" Forgive me, Ida! yet you cannot tolerate this&#xD;
sentiment I Does he believe in an hereafter? Does he allude&#xD;
to it?"&#xD;
"No-bu.t he does believe-I have thought, sometimes, with&#xD;
more than the intellect. Do not judge him hardly ;-he has&#xD;
suffered much of late; more from morbi sensibility than actual&#xD;
troubles, but he imagined his woes too ~ieavy to be borne. He&#xD;
is not fit to cope with sorrow."&#xD;
"None of us are, 'till we have been taught the uses of afflic-&#xD;

"He will be more manageable then," he replied encouragingly.&#xD;
The wind blew roughly, and he folded her cloak around her.&#xD;
"I recognized you: by this, and your walk, and fearing lest&#xD;
you might encounter ruc~eness in your nocturnal ramble, kept&#xD;
you in 8ight. I heard yo~ir voice at the watchman's challenge,&#xD;

Ida did not know herself when they stopped at the door-her&#xD;
unei~siness all gone, and with it the unnatural strength that&#xD;
impelled her venturesome step-~-he had assumed t~ie burden;&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
I~ the bosom of the forest, the tall oaks gir4ling it, like a&#xD;
band of mailed warriors, changed by the spell of beauty from&#xD;
assailants to a guard, lay a little glade, free from brush or sapling;&#xD;
its tender green carpet freshening in the March sun. The trees&#xD;
loved the dance of the shadowy over that sylvan ball-room, and&#xD;
they revelled there all the day, and at evening, slept upon the&#xD;
turf in the moonlight. The clouds of the night had rolled away&#xD;
before a westerly breeze, and the forest was full of 'sweet and&#xD;
pleasant sounds. The oriole had come in advance of .the season&#xD;
to look for his last year's nest; the woodpecker thrummed upon&#xD;
a hollow trunk; and the robins, too busy for more than an occa-&#xD;
sional note, flew about with sticks and mud in their bills. The&#xD;
teaming earth was quick with vitality; you could hear the un-&#xD;
furling of the grass-blades, the rustle of the leaf-buds as they&#xD;
broke ground.&#xD;
An unharmonious sound interrupted the concert-the rattle&#xD;
of a carriage. It stopped; then another drove up; and six gen-&#xD;
tlemen, three from either side, entered~ the glade, saluting each&#xD;
other as they advanced. Lynn's friends were ~'Ir. Thornto~n and&#xD;
Mr. Villet; Pemberton, Talbot and another of "the set," by the&#xD;
name of Watson. Without wasting time in irrelevant chat~ the&#xD;
seconds walked apart for consultation. Pemberton, with a braga~&#xD;
docio air, offered his cigar-case 'to his companion; and nothing&#xD;
abashed by his digxiified gesture of refusal, planted himself&#xD;
against a tree, and began to smoke. Lynn paced the little area&#xD;
in silence. He was haggard to ghastliness ; 'the effect of a night&#xD;
of sleeplessness and racking thought. He was brave; his nerves&#xD;
did not tremble in the hour of peril; but the soul, forced, before&#xD;
its time, upon the verge of an unknown sea, shook with a name-&#xD;
less dread of the punishment of its temerity.' Early teachings,&#xD;
and the convictions later years weighed upon him. A tiny&#xD;
wild flower blossomed by his foot-he plucked it, and pressed&#xD;
its petals open with his finger. Whose hand had fashioned it?&#xD;
Whose sun kissed it into bloom? Whose goodness granted it&#xD;

&#xD;
A L ONE.-&#xD;
&#xD;
this lovely home? It owed its little life to the Father, from&#xD;
whom he had derived his poet-soul; it had fulfilled the end of&#xD;
its creation ;-he was about to hurl his gifts, a million times&#xD;
more precious, into the face of the Giver. He would gladly&#xD;
have courted other thoughts, but these would come; and long-&#xD;
forgotten texts floated before him; apparently without a cause&#xD;
to call them forth. One met him, wherever he looked-" Des-&#xD;
pisest thou the riches of his forbearance, and love and long-&#xD;
suffering ?'~ And as he repeated, despisest thou"-another-&#xD;
"Behold, ye despises, and wonder and perish 1" These words&#xD;
were upon his tongue, as Mr. Violet put the pistol into hi~ hand,&#xD;
and motioned him into his place.&#xD;
Peniberton had sent the challenge, ~with no thought of its&#xD;
being accepted, counting upon the interference of Lynn's friends.&#xD;
Mr. Thornton had waited upon him with his principal's answer,&#xD;
settling time, place and weapons; driving him into a corner,&#xD;
from whence h~ could only escape by following out his own&#xD;
proposition. A strained sense of honour was Lynn's birth-&#xD;
right, His father had died upon the field; and repudiation of&#xD;
the duellist's code involved censure of him. Thus they stood~&#xD;
face to face, upon this unclouded, fragrant spring morning, to\&#xD;
wash out in blood the memory of a trifle which would have&#xD;
perished of itself in this time, but for the pains they had taken&#xD;
to perpetuate it. Oh, Virginia! most fondly loved of mothers!&#xD;
how often has thy soil drank the blood of sons, the tears of&#xD;
daughters, whose lives and weal have been sacrificed to this&#xD;
pitiless Moloch!&#xD;
Mr. Tt~lbot explained that the signal ~as to be the dropping&#xD;
of a hand erchief, after he should have counted three slowly&#xD;
Mr. Ville~ held the, handkerchief "One-two-" said Tal&#xD;
bot, deliberately. Lynn had only .to see the murder in hi~&#xD;
antagonis1~'s eye, when a report rang through the forest, and&#xD;
he felt -&amp;amp; sharp pain in his breast and arm.&#xD;
"Treachery !" shouted Thornton, excitedly. "Shoot him&#xD;
down, Holmes! he deserves a dog's death !"&#xD;
Lynn's hot blood w~s up-he raised his arm. The loaded and&#xD;
discharged pistols were whirling in the air-and Charley Dan~&#xD;
and Morton Lacy threw themselves between the combatants.&#xD;
"At whose instance was this meeti~~ig brought about, gentle&#xD;
men ?" questioned the former, peremptorily, scanning the group&#xD;
&#xD;
A L ONE .&#xD;
&#xD;
187&#xD;
&#xD;
"The challenge came from my principal," answered Watson,'&#xD;
with a brazen look.&#xD;
"Will you honour me by a minute's private conversation,&#xD;
sir ?" asked Charley, facing Pemberton, with a sneer seen by&#xD;
him alone. "You need not be afraid," he pursued, not receiving&#xD;
an immediate reply. "I do not carry concealed weapons."&#xD;
Pemberton went. aside with him very reluctantly. He&#xD;
respected, because he feared Charley. Without a correct under~.&#xD;
standing of his character, he stood in awe of the keen ridicule&#xD;
and calm courage, for which his blustering was no match.&#xD;
"You must be at a loss for something to do, that you covet&#xD;
such business as this ;" began Charley. "I have no objection&#xD;
to your blowing your brains out-and any coroner in the country&#xD;
would decide that an inquest would .be 'much-ado about nothing;'&#xD;
but it~ is another matter when you try, in cold blood, to take the&#xD;
life of one, who has some pretensions to the name of man. You&#xD;
are a cowardly poltroon L If you are on the look-out for insults,&#xD;
there is one, if truth can insult. Two policemen are at a little&#xD;
distance. The law will have a more serious job than I antici-&#xD;
pated. There are five witnesses to the fact, that you fired in&#xD;
advance of~ the time. Join this to your provocation of the other&#xD;
night, and your having sent the ,challenge; and it will not&#xD;
require a Philadelphia lawyer to make out a case, which will&#xD;
put a stop to your murderous propensities for awhile. Now, sir,&#xD;
what do you propose to do 7"&#xD;
The bully shook visibly. "Really, Mr. Dana, this is an&#xD;
extraordinary procedure. You and I have no quarrel.'&#xD;
"I beg your pardon-men of honour do not pass over such&#xD;
remarks as I have indulged in. You did not l~ear me, perhaps;&#xD;
I said, and say now, you are a pitiful* poltroon! shaking in your&#xD;
shoes, this minute, at the prospect of the penitentiary, and the&#xD;
loss of your soap-locks. But before I give you into the keeping&#xD;
of your lawful guardians, I have a proposal to make on my own&#xD;
account. I came here with the intention of giving you a casti.&#xD;
nation for your impertinent mention of a' lady. I will not fight&#xD;
a duel with you, but if you 'resist, I will take care you do not&#xD;
shoot me. I meant to horse-whip you, and I will-within an&#xD;
inch of your life, if you do not make an ample apology. You&#xD;
cannot bully or blarney me, Pemberton. We kiiow each other."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7999-00000095"/>&#xD;
188        ALONE.                                ALONE.        189&#xD;
&#xD;
In abject terms, he declared that he had the highest venera-&#xD;
tion for Mr. Dana's friend, Miss Ross; he was in wine at the&#xD;
time spoken of, and was unaware, until told of it, that he had&#xD;
mentioned her-&#xD;
"That will do !" interposed Charley. "Are you ready to&#xD;
rejoin yO~2r friends 7"&#xD;
"Youwill not do me this great injury, Mr. Dana! think of&#xD;
the exposure~the disgrace! A duel is an honourable affair, if&#xD;
carried out; but when it takes a turn like this, you will admit&#xD;
it looks confoundedly mean.~~&#xD;
Charley could not but smile at his ludicrously. pathetic tone.&#xD;
"Will you bind yourself to behave better to your superiors-.-.&#xD;
Mr. Holmes included-if I help you out of the scrape 7"&#xD;
The pledge was eagerly given.&#xD;
"Your best plan will be to state to the company that, in con-&#xD;
sequence 'pf explanations made by me, you retract the challenge,&#xD;
and likewise the offensive remark that provoked Mr. Holmes to&#xD;
assault you. Offer your hand to him, with the best grace you&#xD;
can muster; jump into your carriage-and you shall not be&#xD;
pursued."&#xD;
The seconds were huddled together, talking of the novel phase&#xD;
of the affairs; Lynn and Morton walking to and fro; the latter&#xD;
speaking earnestly, while Lynn's averted face showed he was not&#xD;
unmoved. Pemberton obeyed instructions to the letter; and&#xD;
with a trepidation and hurry which nearly betrayed Charley into&#xD;
a disgrace of the dignity of the occasion. After a grasp at&#xD;
Iynn's hand, he bowed hastily, summoned his attendants, and&#xD;
disappeared among the trees. The crack of the driver's whip&#xD;
proclaimed his departure. Thornton and Villet were profuse&#xD;
in their injuries, but they were little wiser for Charley's replies.&#xD;
Atr exclamation from Morton interrupted them.&#xD;
d~You are wounded !" said he, pointing to Lynn's arm, from&#xD;
wl~ich the blood was oozing.&#xD;
~' Only a scratch," replied he.&#xD;
Oharley ripped up his sleeve; uncovering a flesh wound of&#xD;
no~ great depth. The ball had passed between his side and arm.&#xD;
grazing both ;-its aim was the heart.&#xD;
"If I had seen this sooner 1". said Charley, involuntarily.&#xD;
"What 'if you had 7" inquired. Lynn.&#xD;
&#xD;
lie made no reply, but proceeded to bind up the wound.&#xD;
"Geatlemen I" said he, when he had done ;-" your carriage&#xD;
and breakfast are waiting. I take it, you have nothing more&#xD;
on hand this morning."&#xD;
Thornton and Villet bowed, half-offended; Lynn lingered.&#xD;
"How are you going back ?" he asked of Morton, but looking&#xD;
at Charley.&#xD;
"Our horses are not far off," answered the former, kindly.&#xD;
"We will see you again in an hour or two."&#xD;
"Coming I" responded Lynn, to his friends' impatient call.'&#xD;
He looked again to Charley's grave' face, beseechingly and&#xD;
timidly; but could not summzrn courage to break the silence.&#xD;
"Do not punish him too severely, Charley," said Morton.&#xD;
He turned from him without speaking. He had never seen him&#xD;
so affected before. They were alone in the glade; and the&#xD;
birds, silenced for a time by human voices, were heard again&#xD;
twittering in the boughs. Oharley spoke at length.&#xD;
"I have been deceived, Lacy. I thought I knew men, and&#xD;
was prepared for any inconsistency; but if I had been told that&#xD;
the man, cherished for years as a brother, would mislead me&#xD;
purposely in a matter of vital importance to us both, I would not&#xD;
have credited it. I had his promise, or what amounted to a&#xD;
promise, that he would not stir without consulting me. What&#xD;
weakness !" he continued, more agitated, "to abandon fame and&#xD;
friends and life, because of a fancied slight from a woman&#xD;
"Yet are we guiltless of similar failings 7" said Morton,&#xD;
impressively. "Have therenot been times when we too were&#xD;
impatient-despairing.---for no more weighf~y cause? My dear&#xD;
Charley, let us judge leniently, errors into which we might have&#xD;
fallen, but for greater strength or less powerful temptation.&#xD;
Disapproval and forgiveness are not incompatible."&#xD;
"You have witnessed the one-.--will you be the bearer of the&#xD;
other ?" asked Charley, trying to smile, "I will not oblige him&#xD;
to ask it. He has had humiliation enough for one day."&#xD;
Mr. Lacy's first care, upon their return to the city, was to&#xD;
dispatch a note tQ Ida. It merely announced the success of' their&#xD;
expedition; the means adopted to secure it, she gathered from&#xD;
Charley. They had gone together, first to Lynn's then to&#xD;
Pemberton's lodgings, when Charley had been informed of the&#xD;

project meeting. They were reported "not at home." They&#xD;
then hit upon the unpromising expedient of going to every hack~&#xD;
stand in the city, to ascertain, if possible, at what time the party&#xD;
was to start in the morning, and its route. They failed, in two&#xD;
or three oases to arouse the keepers; and from others received&#xD;
unimportant and surly replie~. Charley had just asked, "Do~&#xD;
you mean to give it up ?" and b~en answered by a firm "Never!"&#xD;
when a negro bustled by th4m. Morton seized him by the&#xD;
shoulder, and led him to an apothecary's lamp.&#xD;
"I thought so!"&#xD;
"I've got a pass. Let me go 1" said the fellow, struggling.&#xD;
"Not until I know where you have been. You are Mr.&#xD;
Talbot's servant.-yoii -may gain ~omething,~and shall not lose,&#xD;
by answering. me civilly.' 'What were you sent for ?"&#xD;
By smooth and harsh words, he was brought to acknowledge~&#xD;
that his "young master" having had ' company all the evening,&#xD;
had forgotten, until late, to send him to a livery-stable to engage&#xD;
a carriage foiKfive- o'clock next morning.&#xD;
"Who is with him, besides Mr. Pemberton ?"~ inquired'&#xD;
Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"Mr. Watson, sik."&#xD;
"How far are th~y to go, after crossing the river ?"&#xD;
"Lor! Massa! h~wyoureconIknow?"&#xD;
"1~fo trifling, sir!' If I 'wanted to create mischief, you have&#xD;
said enough. Tell me everything, or I will go at once to your&#xD;
master I"&#xD;
The man instantly named their flestination, which his master&#xD;
had let slip in his hearing; and added that. they were "fixing&#xD;
pistols."' The information was corroborated by a call upon the&#xD;
liveryman, and they acted upon it. The delay, which was so&#xD;
near being fatal, arose from their ignorance of a newer and&#xD;
shorter road than they chose.&#xD;
"How Lacy guessed their intentions, I cannot imagine," said&#xD;
Charley.- "He would not entrust to me the name of his infor-&#xD;
mant; and Lynn is as much in th~ dark. He brought your&#xD;
letter to the doer after he was sure you had retired and mine&#xD;
was left upon his desk. 'But Lacy is discreet, from principle,&#xD;
not from caprice."&#xD;
"He is,". said Ida -with heightened color. "If any stigma&#xD;
attaches t~ the informer, it must rest upon me."&#xD;

"' Just like him, no le-hearted and faithful I" exclaimed&#xD;
Charley, when her story '~,ras ended. "Shall you tell Lynn ?"&#xD;
"Yes---if only to sho~ him how his friends love him. He&#xD;
in ay view it as a breach of confidence; but I had rather he should&#xD;
reproach me, than suspect the innocent."&#xD;
Whether he reproached her or not, the revelation- did not&#xD;
diminish his regard f9r her. Except at their first agitating&#xD;
interview, he never averted to the unfinished duel; but he&#xD;
seemed drawn to her by a new tie, in the collection of her&#xD;
readiness to adventure so much in his 'behalf. Ellen Morris left&#xD;
town for a visit to Petersburg, the day after the rupture :-left&#xD;
without a message or line of penitence or conciliation. 'Lynn&#xD;
did not complain, but his moodiness subsided into a pensivebess,&#xD;
illumined by the flashes of hislormer animation, like the sparkle&#xD;
of smouldering embers.&#xD;
It was during one of these gleams that he spent the 'evening&#xD;
at the rendezvous of what Josephine styled the 'KDat~a clique."&#xD;
John Dana and his amiable wife were great favorites of his and&#xD;
Mr. Lacy's. Their friendly calls may have been more frequent&#xD;
because it was Ida's chief visiting place. Mr. Dana was in New&#xD;
York, and she had dined and taken tea with her friend.&#xD;
Lynn came in with Charley, and the latter, excusing himself~&#xD;
for an hour after supper, left Ida and the young artist together.&#xD;
"I have been thinking lately, how sublime a thing is phi-&#xD;
lanthropy," said Lynn', throwing himself with boyish abandon,&#xD;
upon the rug at her feet. "I welcome this train of thought&#xD;
as. a sign, that I am growing less selfish, for I have been&#xD;
sadly, sinfully selfish, Ida--~nadly intent upon my schemes,&#xD;
my happiness-.forgetting that God placed me in the world&#xD;
to benefit others. Lacy was in my studio to-day', and we had&#xD;
a talk upon this subject. He says there is always a reflex tide&#xD;
of the happiness we send forth to those around us; a 'purer,&#xD;
tr.ner joy than self-gratification.. 'In this respect,' he observed,&#xD;
'we can best imitate the example of our Supremre Benefactor.'&#xD;
Imitate our Creator, Ida! that is something worth living for."&#xD;
"You have much besides, to make life precious, Lynn~&#xD;
remember when it seemed worthless to me; when I thought&#xD;
had tasted all the sweetness it possessed-I have changed my&#xD;
opinionsince."&#xD;

"Ali I but you have never bowed soul and spirit to an idol)&#xD;
and 'found it clay;' never realized in the dread hour that saw&#xD;
its demolition, that the fairest growth of heart and mind-the&#xD;
plants which you flattered yourself were climbing heavenward,&#xD;
had only twined themselves with strengthening tendrils about&#xD;
the altar of that one love! I know the meaning of the expres-&#xD;
sion,, 'broken cisterns, which can hold no water.' I have felt&#xD;
for some time past as if my heart were a stagnant marsh, flooded&#xD;
by waste affections To-day I have been happier, more hopeful.&#xD;
I will beg~n life ane~w, and strive for ~ny art and for my kind."&#xD;
"I hav~e often told you that you have rare qualifications for&#xD;
usefulness," rejoined Ida. "Your besetting fault is unsteadi-&#xD;
ness of purpose; the best resolutions avail ~nothing if they are not&#xD;
adhered to."&#xD;
"I know it. I dare not say now, that I will keep my present&#xD;
frame of mind until to-morrow; but I do feel as if a broad field&#xD;
were spread i~efore me, and a bright, bright heaven over-arched&#xD;
it. I can think and speak of Ellen; I comfort myself by ima-&#xD;
gining that our separation is for our mutual good-our charac-&#xD;
ters required discipline, and dimly in the future I see visions of&#xD;
reconciliation and re-union." Poor boy! the idol was not g~ne&#xD;
yet! He sat in an~ attitude of careless grace, his hand support-&#xD;
ing his cheek, and the light falling upon his upturned face.&#xD;
"Yes," he continued, thoughtfully. "I am convinced that my&#xD;
life has beeti spared for some important end, and I will work it&#xD;
out, whenever Providence designates the ways and means 9f its&#xD;
accomplishment. I do not overland my ability; for youth, and&#xD;
health, and energy, are almost qxnnipotent, and I am young, and&#xD;
strong, and willing."&#xD;
" You will not be offended if I aid you in the work ?" asked&#xD;
Ida.&#xD;
"No; and I anticipate your warning. You would say that&#xD;
aelf-conqnest lies at the base of all other victories. Ah! you will&#xD;
yet be ashamed of your incredulity as to my regeneration. That&#xD;
is Charley's Noice, he has brought Lacy, too! I am glad 1"&#xD;
Ida. was more thau glad. She had seen him since their mid-&#xD;

~even a look of acknowledgment.&#xD;

"What have you two been posing about ?" asked Charley,&#xD;
recently.&#xD;
"I have been talking-Miss Ida listening," said Lynn.&#xD;
'She has no faith in my determination to play 'good boy,' and&#xD;
as she knows me better than I do myself, I am uneasy for the&#xD;
durability of my excellent resolve. Do say something encour-&#xD;
aging, Lacy."&#xD;
"What is this reformation? of mind or manner ?" inquired&#xD;
Morton.&#xD;
"Mind, manner, heart and will. I have been a wilful trou-&#xD;
blesome child all my life; I mean, from this time forward, to be&#xD;
a man~."&#xD;
"And how are you setting about it ?"&#xD;
"Oh! I am theorising now. I have no distinct object, except&#xD;
*to do the best I can; to mortify evil passions, to upi~oot selfish&#xD;
desires, to foster the germs of good in myself and others."&#xD;
Mr. Lacy smiled, a little sadly. "You have undertaken a&#xD;
Sisyphus task, if you heave the stone up the hill in your own&#xD;
strength."&#xD;
Lynn looked dismayed. "Yet it is our duty to do all this.&#xD;
The Scriptures, for whose infallibility you contend, set a higher&#xD;
standard of faith and practice than I have done."&#xD;
"But they tell us in so many words, 'Ye can of yourselves,&#xD;
do nothing.' Who can say, 'I have made my heart elean-.--1&#xD;
am pure from my sin?"'&#xD;
"You do not agree with the fanatics who denounce morality,&#xD;
I hope," said Charley. "I heard one hold forth last Sabbath.&#xD;
He told us 'our righteousness was as filthy rags.' I had read my&#xD;
Bible, and knew tl~iat; but he heated Gehenna seven times&#xD;
hotter for 'ye miserable moralists' than for the vilest outcast&#xD;
that ever dishonored the image in which he was made. I make&#xD;
no pretensions to piety, but I endeavour to do my duty to my&#xD;
fellow-men; to hate none, and help all. I go to church because&#xD;
1 think it right, if only for the example I set to others; I don't&#xD;
expect my good~works to bea passport to haven; but I thought,&#xD;
as I listened to him, that his orthodoxy and zeal, without cEarity,.&#xD;
would profit hii4 nothing."&#xD;
"You were pi~obably nearer right than lie';" said Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
I do not decry morality. Reason teaches us that the henevo.'&#xD;

find more favour in the eyes of a righteous judge than the rioter,&#xD;
the cheat, the debauchee and tyrant. Much injury is done to&#xD;
religion by the mistaken zeal of its advocates. This was not the&#xD;
spirit of its Founder. To me, the history of the young ruler,&#xD;
who cameo Christ, is one of the most affecting in the New Tes-&#xD;
tament. He w9 not driven away by disheartening rebukes;&#xD;
but 'Jesus, Iooki~ig on him, loved him.' How tenderly must he&#xD;
have uttered-' ]~ut one thing thou blackest' "&#xD;
"But how unn~itural is the finale I" said Lynn. "'And he&#xD;
went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.' He let hi~&#xD;
lucre outweigh his soul !"&#xD;
"Take care how you condemn 1" said Charley. "There&#xD;
are 'possessions' besides silver and gbld, which clog a man's&#xD;
steps. Love of' pleasuree has ruined more souls than love of&#xD;
gain.&#xD;
"And procrastination more than both together;" added Mor.&#xD;

Ida looked at Charley. "Do you remember our conversation&#xD;
after the protracted meeting, last summer ?" asked she. "I felt,&#xD;
when you spoke of Death and Eternity, that I could never dose&#xD;
my eyes again in peace; but the impression wore off; and we&#xD;
are here, tonight, it may be, no better prepared for our inevi.&#xD;
table change than we were then."&#xD;
"Yet we are content to hunt for the motives of this inconsis-&#xD;
tency 'of belief and action, instead of rectifying it 1" said Mr.&#xD;
Lacy, seriously.&#xD;
"You predestina~ians may excuse us upon the ground that we&#xD;
are waiting the 'set time;'" remarked Chai~ley.&#xD;
"God's time is 'now;'" answered his friend. "'To-mor-&#xD;

"Thank you," s4id' Lynn. . "Then I am to do nothing'?"&#xD;
"Nothing as yet, but believe and trust. Having enlisted in&#xD;
the service, you will not be left idle. But I am overstaying my&#xD;
time;. I engaged to meet a friend at half-past nine, and it is&#xD;
nearly ten. I had* rather stay here, but good night, never-&#xD;
theless."&#xD;
"And I have not thanked him I" thought Ida, disappointed&#xD;
-but-&#xD;
"Miss Ida !'~ called Charley, from the porch. "Come, see&#xD;
this cloud !"&#xD;
A pile of snow-clouds was heaving up toward" the moon,&#xD;
which fringed their jagged outlines with silver, unearthly bright&#xD;
from the blacknbss below.&#xD;
"You would say1 'gloomily beautiful;"' said Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
He was close besi~le her, and approachable as ever; and Char-&#xD;
ley held Mrs. Dana and Lynn in conversation. In one sentence,&#xD;
she expressed her sense of obligation, and her regret that he had&#xD;
had so much trouble in executing her commission.. His face was&#xD;
in the shade, but she felt his look.&#xD;
"Nothing is a trouble to me, that promotes your happiness."&#xD;
She went back to the parlor, with a tumultuous joy at heart.&#xD;
The full significance of his words she did notunderstand till long&#xD;
afterwards.&#xD;
"Mr. Lacy should study for the ministry ;" said Mrs. Dana.&#xD;
"He. does more good as he is ;"' replied Charley, stoutly. "If&#xD;
all Christians performed their duty as well, you and I would live&#xD;
to see the Millennium. He can reach men, who would fly at&#xD;
'the glimpse of a white cravat. There is some charm about the&#xD;
man; his religion 'is a part of himself; and he carries it every.&#xD;

"I love 'to listen to him; but he makes me very uncomfort..&#xD;
able ;" said Mrs. Dana.&#xD;
"It is so with me;" responded Lynn. "Our conferences~&#xD;
always leave me out of humour with myself, and envious of&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I think the secret of his influence lies in his humility and&#xD;
charity ;" remarked Ida; "in his not holding himself so far&#xD;
above us 'deluded ~orldlings,' as certain of his brethren. He&#xD;
believes there is good in all; not that he is all-good."&#xD;
"These all-good people are too apt to slam the door of Hea-&#xD;
ven, as soon as they are on the safe side, themselves;" answered&#xD;
Charley. "Lacy would be willing t~ see the whole human race&#xD;
saved."&#xD;
"Who would not ?" laughed Ida.&#xD;
"'Who would not!' why, I honestly thougl~t, before I knew&#xD;
him, that many professors of religion,-those~ of his' denomina-&#xD;
tion, especially-would be sorely chagrined at an event so oppo-&#xD;
site to their calculations"&#xD;
"I wish I were, as certainly predestinatedd' as he is;" said&#xD;
Lynn, with a smile atid a sigh.&#xD;
"I cannot quite subscribe to your 'election' principles; but&#xD;
if I were altogether such an one as he seems to be, I should con-&#xD;
sider my chance pretty safe;" returned Charley.&#xD;
"You are not going, Ida I" remonstrated Mrs. Dana. "Stay&#xD;
all night with me."&#xD;
"I ,cannot. We shall have a -~snow storm to-morrow, and I&#xD;
might be detained several days."&#xD;
"No great harm if you are !" said Charley."&#xD;
"Not if I have duties which call me home? I will coi4e&#xD;
again shortly, but I muSt go now."&#xD;
Charley, as' host pro tempore, got his hat; and Lynn followed&#xD;
them into the street, with, "I hope I don't intrude I" The tei~..&#xD;
pest was near at hand; the gust that buffeted them at the cop-&#xD;
nets made them stagger. Lynn forced Ida' to take his arm als~,&#xD;
and in this style they breasted the storm, gaily. Ida looked oi~t&#xD;

watched the snow-flakes; enjoying the perfect quiet, and' free-'&#xD;
dom from interruption. Upon each evening, she sat by her&#xD;
window, until she could not distinguish the boundary between&#xD;
the leaden sky and the white earth; and the snow, she bad been&#xD;
brushing off all day, banked up against the glass. "Heigho!&#xD;

night. "It will seem so dark and dreary below after the society&#xD;
that has cheered my sanctum 1"&#xD;
The ice was breaking up below, in a hail-storm, which had all&#xD;
the sharpness of a conjugal "difference," without the stinging&#xD;
politeness genteel people throw into their wrangles. Ida listened&#xD;
and sickened and sighed. A pealing ring checked the dispu~&#xD;
tants. Ida's heart flu~d, and Josephine looked up anxiously&#xD;
'at the foot~ntra~&#xD;
"Mr. ID~ see F~s Ross"&#xD;
"Of cdrs&amp;amp;'then,. I shall not go out;" said Josephine,&#xD;

"My friend, and she is under my protection ;" said he, impa-&#xD;
tient at the detention. A carriage was waiting. Ida asked one&#xD;
0&#xD;
question.-" When was he attacked ?"&#xD;
"Within three hours after we parted from you. He stayed&#xD;
with me at John's that night; complained before retiring, of&#xD;
thirst and chilliness; and awoke with a raging fever. The&#xD;
doctorss pronounce the disease inflammation of the~lungs, of the&#xD;
most virulent nature. Re had a lucid interval this evening, and&#xD;
asked for you."&#xD;
She did not say; "Is there hope 7" She knew there was&#xD;
none.&#xD;
Charley exchanged a word with the servant who opened the&#xD;
door, and led t&amp;amp;e way directly to the sick-chamber. Mrs. Dana&#xD;
met her with a tearful embrace; she saw no one else, but the&#xD;
figure upon the' bed. But for the dark circles about the eyes&#xD;
and mouth, the unmistakable signet of Death, he might have&#xD;
seemed in perfect health. He appeared to be asleep, until she&#xD;
stood at his pillow; then opened his eyes upon her horror-stricken&#xD;
face, and made an effort to smile.&#xD;
"Ida 1"&#xD;
"Dear Lynn I"&#xD;
His breath was short "I am almost gone. Give my fare-&#xD;
well to Ellen,-I forgave and loved her to the last. Bury her&#xD;
miniature with me. I have done with earth."&#xD;
He closed his eyes. They brought a cordial. Hi~ wistful&#xD;
glance ran around the room, and returned to her.&#xD;
"What is it, dear Lynn ?"&#xD;
Oh! the mournful intensity of that look! and the clammy&#xD;
fingers clasped hers. "'.1 did not tki~k' I should die so soon! Is&#xD;
Lacy4 here 7"&#xD;
He came forward at her sign\&#xD;
"I am dying.-I have not t~ine 'to search for myself-...see if&#xD;
there is any promise for me&#xD;
"'Him that oometh~ unto me, I will in no wise cast out;"'&#xD;
repeated Mr. Lacy, instantly. "'He is able also, to save unto&#xD;
the uttermost all them, who come unto God by Him,-seeing&#xD;
lie ever liveth to make intercession for them.',~&#xD;
The fading eyes were re-lit with eagerness.&#xD;
"us that there?. did He say so, or did you 7"&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
~dHe said it, who declares; moreover, that He is not willing&#xD;
for 'any to perish but that all should turn and live."'&#xD;
His dying gaze was upward, and his lips moved in prayer&#xD;
"To the uttermost-the uttermost!" he whispered. "'Lord!&#xD;
remember-me,---when Thou comest.-into-Thy-"'&#xD;
He sank into a stupor; and the physician administered another&#xD;
stimulant. He had besought them not to permit him to sleep&#xD;
while reason lasted. One' and another had come in, on hearing&#xD;
of his danger, and the room was nearly filled; but there was not a&#xD;
word or loud breath, to distract the meditations of the parting soul.&#xD;
Charley and Mrs. Dana were nearest him on one side, Ida and&#xD;
Mr. Lacy, on the other. He looked at them fondly.&#xD;
"Friends! dear friends! 'There is a friend-' "'to Lacy.&#xD;
He finished the sentence -." That sticketh closer than a&#xD;
brother."&#xD;
"Yes :-I remember-who is able to save-.-.-to-the-utter-&#xD;
most-" his voice died away. When next his eyes moved, it&#xD;
was slowly and painfully; but their restless light was not extinct.&#xD;
The stiffening' mouth contracted.&#xD;
"He says 'Pray!'~' said Ida to Morton.&#xD;
Every head was bowed; and the opening sentence of the&#xD;
prayer brought a deeper quiet to every heart.&#xD;
"'Lord I Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all. genera..&#xD;
tions!'"&#xD;
The language was simple, scriptural and fervent,-the plead-&#xD;
ing of a son, in behalf of a brother, with an indulgent Parent.&#xD;
As he repeated the text, Lynn had dwelt upon, Ida feft the feeble&#xD;
pressure of his hand ;-he was alive and conscious then. The&#xD;
rest arose at the "Amen." She had not knelt; but she did not&#xD;
raise her head from the pillow ;-her soul kiad caught the fare-&#xD;
well of his, as it flew away upon its long journey! There was a&#xD;
movement through the) room-a breathless pause-a solemn&#xD;
voice said" He is gone I" and tears and sobbings broke forth.&#xD;
His hand still held hers; and the other r~as folded over&#xD;
them in supplication ;-~-the eyes still looked heavenward-but&#xD;
they were fixed..&#xD;
Dead! dead! in his glorious beauty-in the flush of youth!&#xD;
deaf to the recall of mourning hearts-and the awakening~&#xD;
ech4~es of the fame his genius had won! If he could die, who&#xD;
was sure of an hour of life.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
ELLEN MORRIS accepted an invitation to Petersburg, ere the&#xD;
angry pique,. aroused by Lynn's reproaches, passed off~ The&#xD;
promise was hardly given, when she would have revoked it, had&#xD;
not pride held her to her word. Her friends were solicitous,&#xD;
that the far-famed hospitality of their city should not seem to&#xD;
the Richmond beauty, to have been vaunted too highly; and she&#xD;
appreciated their efforts; but the fortnight she had named as the&#xD;
period of her stay, crept slowly by. She hoped confidently to&#xD;
see her lover again at her feet, when the heat of passion was over;&#xD;
yet she was wretched in the recollection of her trifling, and the&#xD;
misery it had inflicted upon his high-toned spirit. Twice she&#xD;
prepared to write to him, and end a suspense torture g to both,&#xD;
-and twice dashed down the pen in shame and pride. The&#xD;
wished-for hour of departure arrived. The morning ~as bleak;&#xD;
the snow had ceased falling, but the clouds were low and threat-&#xD;
ening. Her entertainers begged her to wait buta day longer.&#xD;
"If it were a matter of life and death, you could not be more&#xD;
obstinate," said her -hostess,~fretted at her unreasonableness.&#xD;
"And how do you know that it is not ?" answered she,&#xD;
jestingly.'&#xD;
"It is no joking matter, Miss Ellen," said a young man,&#xD;
gravely. "They have not cleared the snow from the track as it&#xD;
ought to be done. You would feel badly to have your neck&#xD;
broken1"&#xD;
"That is a trifle compared with a broken heart;" and she&#xD;
laughed lightly.&#xD;
The train started, and the shivering passengers resigned them-&#xD;
selves to a comfortless ride. Ellen's escort, an elderly gentleman,&#xD;
lost no time in settling his chin and ears down in the collar of&#xD;
his great coat, and the rest of his body in a corner, to ek~ep.&#xD;
She was wide-awake; and her spirits, raised by the near prospect&#xD;
of the meeting, her hopes had fed upon, for weary days and&#xD;
nights, found amusement in the uncouth figures, seen by the&#xD;
struggling light. She did not suffer from the cold or damp; her&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       201&#xD;
pulses bounded warmly; and when tired of being a solitary&#xD;
looker-on, she closed her eyes, and beguiled the time by fancies&#xD;
of home and kini; whether he too were repentant; if he did not&#xD;
show it, rather than lose him, she could humble herself to lurq~~&#xD;
him back ;-she could not be happy without the assurance of&#xD;
his love. She would tell him how miserable their parting had.&#xD;
made her; and imagination revelled in the anticipation of the&#xD;
refreshing flood, her thirsting heart would receive in return.&#xD;
There were pictures of days, which should fleet by like a dream;&#xD;
..-.when doubts and fears should be lost in perfect beatitude;&#xD;
the dingy, smoky cars were metamorphosed int~ their cottage&#xD;
home, with its music and flowers and birds, and its atmosphere&#xD;
of love ;-and the votaries of his divine art thronged to offer&#xD;
incense to him-her peerless one!&#xD;
The halting of the laboring engine startled her. The drowsy&#xD;
travellers gathered themselves up; and elbowing and grumbling,&#xD;
rushed out. She lifted the windiYw. They were at the Depot.&#xD;
Half-frozen officials stamped their toes and blew their fingers;&#xD;
hackmen swore at their horses and the porters ;-now and then,&#xD;
a pair of watery eyes peered into the cars, in quest of some&#xD;
expected one; but the form she looked for. ~was not there.&#xD;
"Pshaw! how could he know when she was coming? how silly&#xD;
not to recollect this 1"&#xD;
"There is no one here to meet you, Miss Ellen," said her&#xD;
companion, re-entering.&#xD;
"I hardly expected it, sir; if you will be so kind as to get a&#xD;
carriage for me, I will not trouble you further."&#xD;
Her smile thawed the old man's churlishness. He volun-&#xD;
teered, his foot upon the step "to see her all the way home ;"&#xD;
~but she would not consent.&#xD;
"I am not afraid; this kind 'uncle' will carry me safely."&#xD;
Th~ driver scraped and grinned, although his woolly whiskers&#xD;
were hoary with rime., "Pity all women can't be agreeable 1"&#xD;
said the escort, trudging through the drifts, to his hack. That&#xD;
aj gentleman of his temperament was ever otherwise, even on a&#xD;
raw morning, did not occur to him.       /&#xD;
An omnibus blocked up the street ;-Ellex!i's carriage was.&#xD;
behind it, and the driver's abjurgative eloquence retarded,&#xD;
instead of quickei~ing the movements of its proprietor, who wa~&#xD;
stowing away baggage upon ~the roof.&#xD;

A L ONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hallo 1" cried a yoim~ man, to another, who was knocking&#xD;
the snow from his boots against the curb-stone. "When did&#xD;
you get in?"&#xD;
"Just now. Horrid weather for March !---isn't it? Any&#xD;
news going ?"&#xD;
"Not a bit-all frozen up-..ah.! yes! Lynn Holmes is dead."&#xD;
"What! not the artist! when did it happen? I saw him on&#xD;
the street a week ~ago-another duel ?"&#xD;
"No-lung fever. He died night before last, after forty~&#xD;
eight hours' illness."&#xD;
-~"Shocktng !"&#xD;
"Ellen! you are white -as a sheet I" was Mrs. Morris' greeting.&#xD;
My dear child-are you sick ?"&#xD;
"No ma'am.-only cold-oh! so cold !"&#xD;
"Come to the fire."&#xD;
"I think I will lie down awhile-I am chilled to the heart !"~&#xD;
The servant, who carried her breal~ast, reported her asleep,&#xD;
and the careful mother would not let them waken~ her. Later&#xD;
in the day, she took a cup of hot co ce up to her. She was&#xD;
motionless; her head covered.&#xD;
"My daughter !" said Mrs. Morris, softly, drawing down the&#xD;
coverlet.&#xD;
She looked at her, but did not speak.&#xD;
"How do you feel now ?"&#xD;
"Idon't know, ma'am."&#xD;
"You are not quite awake yet, I believe," said her mother,&#xD;
smiling. "Here, drink this-~--it will do you good."&#xD;
She took it.&#xD;
"By the way, my dear," continued Mrs Morris, busying her-&#xD;
self with the folds of a curtain, which did not hang to suit her.&#xD;
"I have melancholy n~Ws for you. Our friend, Mr. Holmes,&#xD;
died suddenly, night beTore~ last. I never was more astonished&#xD;
and grieved in my life. He was such a handsome, promising&#xD;
young man, and so attached to us! I said directly how sorry&#xD;
you would be to hear ~t. You were so much together-where&#xD;
are the pins? oh! here they are! His disease was a rapid inflam-&#xD;
mation of the lungs. The funeral will take place at the church&#xD;
this afternoon ;-sonie of us must go, if the weather is bad. Do&#xD;
you think you will be well enough ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
203&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes ma ~&#xD;
"Well-I hope so; and now I will go down and keep the&#xD;
children still, so that you can sleep."&#xD;
The thunder of a thousand cannon would not have disturbed&#xD;
her. She heard and saw all that passed; but in place of heart&#xD;
and sense, was a dead vacuity, empty and soundless, although it&#xD;
had eugulphed thought and feeling. She went tothe funeral.&#xD;
Prudent, appearance-loving Mrs. Morris, dexterously flung a veil&#xD;
before the stony eyes, whose tearlessness people might oWerve,&#xD;
and wonder aloud, as she did mentally, at "Ellen's want of&#xD;
feeling ;" but her daughter quietly railed it. The church was&#xD;
crowded. The untimely end of one so gifted and popular~, thrilled&#xD;
the community, as the breast of one man. All was as still as the&#xD;
grave.; the roar of the busy city-life deadened by the heavy atmos-&#xD;
phere and cushioned earth. The wail of a clarion stirred the&#xD;
air;-nearer and nearer it sounded; and the plaintive breathing&#xD;
of other instruments; and at long intervals, a single roll of the&#xD;
drum ;-.nearer and nearer~they ceased, and the procession moved&#xD;
up the aisle. First walked Charles Dana and his sister-in4aw,&#xD;
clad in deep mourning as for a brother; then Morton Lacy, p~le&#xD;
and sorrowful, and on his arm another black-robed figure, (such&#xD;
privilege had Friendship above Love!) then a small band of&#xD;
fellow-artists; and the coffin! borne and followed by the Masonic&#xD;
fraternity, of which he was a member. It was set down in front&#xD;
of the pulpit; "the Book," with its drapery of black crape, laid&#xD;
reverently upon it; and the service proceeded~ There were&#xD;
prayers and hymns and a sermon; she heard none ;-~--the coffin&#xD;
lay in her sight-his coffin! It was tot! Where then was the&#xD;
vigorous life which moved the still form within it? where the&#xD;
soul of splendid imagini~igs and lofty aspirations? where tho~&#xD;
heart, with its wealthy feeling? they could not die! He lived&#xD;
still-and living, loved h~r. That narrow coffin was a horrible&#xD;
mockery. And so, when ~he cover wasremov&amp;amp;d, and those, who&#xD;
from curiosity or affection, desired to look for the last time upon&#xD;
his face, filed slowly by it, she arose too. He was there! royally&#xD;
beautiful, even in his prison-house; the rich black locks swept&#xD;
back from the marble temples; and a smile resting upon the&#xD;
lips. Oh! what power bears woman up in a moment like this!&#xD;
Her life -her world was shut in witlv the replacing of that lid;&#xD;

but she saw each screw returned to its place, without a tear or&#xD;
a shudder ;-h~rself, proposed to her mother, that they should&#xD;
follow the corpse to its home; and watched them heap the snow&#xD;
and clods upon it. And through that and many succeeding&#xD;
nights, she stood in the attic, in told and darkness, straining&#xD;
her eyes towards where the gleaming tomb-stones were visible&#xD;
in the day, and fancying she could tell which shadowed an&#xD;
unsodded mound.&#xD;
Charley was his friend's executor. In the fulfilment of his&#xD;
trust, he found a casket marked-.-" To b9 given, at my death, to&#xD;
E.-M." He thought of sealing it up~ and sending it to her&#xD;
with a note from himself; but decided ~on further deliberation,&#xD;
to entrust it to Ida. It was a painful duty. She was not able&#xD;
yet to speak of Lynn without distressing emotion. His deceased&#xD;
was ~o sudden, so awful,.-.snatched, 'as he was, from he~ very&#xD;
side, with the barest intimation of. his~ danger, after mont~is of&#xD;
intimate intercourse. She mourned foil him as sisters and frIends~&#xD;
seldom weep. Charley did not command. "She was the ~more&#xD;
proper person,"* he 'said; "but he would not grieve her by&#xD;
enforcing the request."&#xD;
"I cannot meet her!" said she. "He was so dear. to us-.&#xD;
how can I endure the sight of her indifference? They say she&#xD;
was calm and careless while they were burying ~&#xD;
"Ci4m-she certainly was; but the glance I had at her face&#xD;
assured me not careless. I am much mistaken if she was not&#xD;
the greatest sufferer by that grave. I was angry with her, pre-&#xD;
viously; I believe now that she merits our compassion."&#xD;
Yet it was an unwilling heart that Ida carried to the inter-&#xD;
view. Ellen sent for her to come to her room. "I am busy,&#xD;
you see," said she, with the ghost of a smile. Ida held the pre-&#xD;
cious legacy ~nore tightly, as she noticed her occupation. A ball-&#xD;
dress was spread upon the bed, and she was fastening roses upon&#xD;
the~skirt. Her cheek was white, as Ida glanced at her own sad-&#xD;
colored dress.&#xD;
"You are going to the party to-night, then ?" said the latter.&#xD;
"Yes-will Josephine attend ?"'&#xD;
"I 'have not heard her say-hav~ not inquired-have not&#xD;
thought of it."&#xD;
Despairing of broaching the subject in any other way, she&#xD;
&#xD;
took the casket from under her shawl, and laid it upon the&#xD;
dress.&#xD;
"The living forget sooner than the dead, Ellen I" was all she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
The unhappy girl recoiled at the familiar characters upon the&#xD;
lid, and stretched out her arms with an imploring cry. 'Ida&#xD;
reached her as she fell. She had fainted. Charley's words were&#xD;
verified, and Ida bI~amed herself severely for her cruel abtuptness.&#xD;
'Her tears ran fast, as she strove to restore~consciousness "Oh!&#xD;
Ida-Lynn I" groaned Ellen, reviving. Reserve, pride, self-&#xD;
control were borne down ;-they wept~ in each other's arms..&#xD;
With the casket pressed to ~her bosom, Ellen heard his last mes-&#xD;
sage, and the hopeful words he had spoken of the future, he was&#xD;
not to know upon earth.&#xD;
"I did love him! Heaven is my witness-I did love him !"&#xD;
she cried, anguishedly. "He did not condemn me; but I can&#xD;
nevei~ forgive myself! If I could have seen him once more to&#xD;
tell him so! Dead! oh! that I were in the grave beside him !"&#xD;
This was grief without a glimmer of hope. Ida had no word&#xD;
of comfort.&#xD;
Ellen's eye fell upon the gossamer robe.-she threw, it upon the&#xD;
floor, and trampled it. "I hate it! and myself, and everything&#xD;
else! I am a. hypocrite! a lying hypocrite! with my hollow&#xD;
* smiles and broken heart. Leave me! go! or I shall hate yotd"&#xD;
Ida left her thus-writhing under the scorpion-lash of remorse,&#xD;
and rejecting consolation. She met Josephine, a square or two&#xD;
from home, and upon the door-step, Mr. Lacy. Admitting him,&#xD;
she ran up stairs to efface the marks of her recent agitation.&#xD;
Her pallor and swollen eyes remained, however, and did z~ot&#xD;
escape him. He did not begin, as many would have done, in&#xD;
his place, to speak of topics entirely foreign to what was in their&#xD;
thoughts; he ~wished to apply a curative; not an anodyne.&#xD;
"Charley tells me you are going to the county, before long;&#xD;
he said. "I do not regret it, as 12 should if I were to stay here&#xD;
myself. After the first of April, Ishall study 'at home, until&#xD;
autumn. You are to pay your friend Carry a visit, are you flot ?"&#xD;
"Yes." -&#xD;
"She is the 'sister' I have heard so much of?"&#xD;
"The same-I wish 'you knew her."&#xD;

Ida.&#xD;
&#xD;
inquired&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was with him' until late, one night, a week before his&#xD;
death," was the reply; "and our conversation may have inspired&#xD;
the thoughts he has expressed here; but I cannott say with ~er&amp;amp;&#xD;
dainty, that it did. If this temper of spirit and heart waS habit..&#xD;
ual to him, what may we not hope 7"&#xD;
"If I" exclaimed Ida, sadly. "Doubt is agonizing. It is&#xD;
not consistent with God's. mercy that he should be eonsi~ned to&#xD;
never ending misery; he whose faults made us love himbetter;&#xD;
the soul of honor and integrity! I will not believe that so much&#xD;
that was pure and good is quenched in eternal darkiwss. This&#xD;
thought is with me night and day. What authority have&#xD;
men, his inferiors by nature-hardly his equals in the practice&#xD;
of virtue, to doom him, and liop~ a happier fate for th0 them-&#xD;

"Who has done this?" asked Mr. Lacy, sternly.&#xD;
"More than oni, in my hearing; and 4Jhailey was exasperated&#xD;

in despairing silence ;-timidity, exchanged ,for rapture, on the&#xD;
bright shore beyond. God only knows the heart-only knows&#xD;
when the doomed oversteps the bounds lie has appointed for his&#xD;
mercy; and as we hope for it ourselves, we should tremble at the&#xD;
thought of limiting it by our finite judgments. In this immea-&#xD;

cannot solve the mystery; i~e know this, however-' He doth&#xD;

pardons a child's faults more ~han a parent? and 'Our Father'&#xD;
is also 14z8. Yet," continued~ he, "Charley erred in repulsing&#xD;
the warning, kindly, if injudiciously extended. The suffering~we&#xD;
experience ~in our uncertainty as to his condition, should teach&#xD;
us to make our salvation sure, so that when our hour shall come&#xD;
-if a call at midnight, we may not leave those who love us,&#xD;

"His death has caused a heart-rending void," said Ida. "'I&#xD;
start whenever the door opens at the hours he was accustomed&#xD;
to visit us. At Mr. Dana's, I am listening all' the time for his&#xD;
step or voice. Oh! .why do nonentities, cumberers of the earth,&#xD;
spin out a tiresome life, and the loved and useful perish ?"&#xD;
"Perhaps they are taken away from the evil to come. You&#xD;
would not rebel if you believed this? At best, what are the&#xD;
short years of toil and change we pass below, compared with the&#xD;
never-ending life of our heavenly home ?"&#xD;
"You forget that I have no portion in that home, Mr. Lacy."&#xD;
"'No portion! You do not mean to refuse an inheritance so&#xD;
graciously offered! It may be~on4g before we have another oppor-&#xD;
tunity to speak of these thing; will you ~nake me a promise ?"&#xD;
"If I can perform it," answered she.&#xD;
"It is that you will every day, ask yourself, 'What happiness&#xD;
does my soul desire tl~at' Christ cannot, and will not bestow?'&#xD;
Will you do' this ?"&#xD;
She promised.&#xD;
"It seems impossible" he pursued, "that a sorer trial than&#xD;
that which you are noi~runder~oing, can befall you; yet there&#xD;
may be such in reserve, and then, I would have you recollect,&#xD;
that as He is the only happiness, He is also the 'only comfort.&#xD;
Willingly-gh~i1y as 'I would suffer 'in your stead, I would not&#xD;
save you a pang, if I thought it was His means to bring you to&#xD;

He spoke with emotion, as if possessed with the conviction&#xD;
that the event he averted to wquld assuredly take place; and&#xD;
that this was hi~ sole chance of preparing her for it. He arose&#xD;
-she gave him her hand-it wa~ taken as silently, and held for&#xD;
a iong minute.&#xD;
"This is not our parting," sai4 he; "if we both live, I shall&#xD;
see you again soon, but to provide~ against oontingeflcie~, I will&#xD;
ask you now to write to me; I m~an, of course, in answer to my&#xD;
letters, as you would to Oharley to a brother,-.---will you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, if your letters are as fr~nk as your speech, and I am&#xD;
granted a like indulgence."&#xD;
True to his promise, he called upon the eve of her departure,,&#xD;
but the presence of the family and other visitors prevented&#xD;
private conversation; and C harley's manoauvres, skilful and un-&#xD;
suspected as they were, failed to effect a diversion of Josephine's&#xD;
watchfulness. Yet as they said "farewell" Ida felt a card&#xD;
slipped into her hand. Upon it was pencilled, "Remember&#xD;
your promise. Mizpah."&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
Ln~ at Poplar-grove was much as it had been, the previous&#xD;
summer; still and bright. The mornings were spent in Carry's&#xD;
pleasant sewing-room, from which male visitors were rigorously&#xD;
excluded; in the afternoon, were the siesta, and ride or walk;&#xD;
at night, music and social chat. Carry feared that this monotony,&#xD;
while it suited her wishes and employmentt, might be tess&#xD;
agreeable to her friend; that she wouVl miss the gay whirl, the&#xD;
intoxicating incense of her city career. But Ida was contented,&#xD;
even happy. Beloved and caressed by the wholi~ household, iii&#xD;
the house of kindred tastes and feeling; and ab&amp;amp;ve all, with the&#xD;
firm hope that her life-long search was at last ended; her wild&#xD;
cravings laid to rest beneath the waves, which welling frokn the&#xD;
unsealed fountain, had risen higher and higher, until h@ soul&#xD;
'was overflowing with love and rapture ;-.--she re'~nlled in the&#xD;
quiet hours of friendly communion, and the sweeter seasons of&#xD;
witching revere. Carry knew nothing of the spring of her&#xD;

happiness. She saw that her mind had acquired a more healthy&#xD;
tone ;-that her affections had expanded, and attributed it to&#xD;
the influence, of friendship ;'-'to a strength of mind, which had&#xD;
determined the world should be what it chose to have It ;-to&#xD;
anything but the true cause,-an idolatry that left no room for&#xD;
suspicion or discontent. Once Carry alluded to the twilight&#xD;
promenade, when Ida. had told her of her forebodings of the&#xD;
wane of' their love, after the nuptials, which were now fast&#xD;
approaching; and was answered by a warm embrace~ and 'smile,&#xD;
which said those fears were 'quelled, and might have betrayed to&#xD;
more prying eyes, the enchantment that had exercised them.&#xD;
Her evening impro'~isations entranced, not only the parlor-circle,&#xD;
but drew to the windows 'a larger audience 'from without, spell-&#xD;
bound by her heart-melodies. All ~er delight wasn't inmemory.&#xD;
Letters came and went ;-from qharley and Mrs. Dana; and&#xD;
*   gossiping notes from Anna Talbot~ and others of "the "girls."&#xD;
*Thes~, Carry enjoyed with her, aAd asked no questions about&#xD;
'those which she'~did not see. Moron's were what he engaged&#xD;
they should be; sincere and friendly, without a hint that could&#xD;
alarm her delicacy.' They were tinctured with a sadness, she&#xD;
did not comprehend, until she noticed his ~any references to&#xD;
his sister's sufferings, and his anx4ty on her account. It was&#xD;
her time to console' and her most valued treasure was the&#xD;
letter, in which- he t~ianked and blessed her. '\&#xD;
*   Carry was to be marriedd the last of July.  The middle of&#xD;
*    June brought Mrs. Dana and the children, under. Charley's&#xD;
protection. For the week of his stay, he 'was the life of the&#xD;
house. One cloud was upon the spirits of all ;~Lynn was&#xD;
missed atid mourned, and by none, with more sorrowful tender-&#xD;
nes~, than' by his vivacious friend; but he was unselfish even&#xD;
in this. Ida could win him to speak of their loss; to the others,&#xD;
he never mentioned it of his own accord. She was correct in&#xD;
saying that he had grown more communicative and affectionate.&#xD;
He seemed to have transferred to her the watchful love that had&#xD;
been Lynn's safeguard and solace.&#xD;
"Nothing changes you, Mars' Charley?" said Uncle Ike, the&#xD;
plan t~tion patriarch, halting at the piazza steps one afternoon,&#xD;
when \he had crawled out into the sunshine.'&#xD;
* "I should like to say the same for you, Uncle Ike; time and&#xD;

&#xD;
"Better'n I deserve, Mars' Charles !-heap better'n I deserve!&#xD;
Time for me to be packed and shoed for my journey. rse lived&#xD;
in these low-grounds of ~sorrow, nigh 'pon ninety years, and&#xD;
many' the young folks I've seen' step down into the grave before&#xD;
me. When I heard that poor, handsome 1~ars' Lynn had gone&#xD;
too, 'pears-like I was ~ready to grumble 'cause 'twant me-but&#xD;
'twas the Almighty's will, Mars' Charles,-'twas 'his will. It&#xD;
voicess me to see you so well and lively-jest like you used to be.&#xD;
You don't take trouble, I reckon, Marster."&#xD;
"No; it's against my principles ;-beside, we'll have a plenty&#xD;
given to us."&#xD;
"Fact, Marster! You aint knowed much yet; but 'the evil&#xD;
days will come, when you' shall say, I have no pleasure in&#xD;
diem!'"&#xD;
Charley kept his seat upon the step for some time after the&#xD;
old man had gone :-once he sighed heavily. Ida was in the&#xD;
parlor, and longed to go out to him, for she guessed the tez~or&#xD;
of his thoughts, but doubted the propriety of intruding upon&#xD;
them. He got up, presently, and began to walk the porch,&#xD;
whistling an opera air. Spying her through the window, he&#xD;
came in. "You are ruining your eyes and health with this&#xD;
eternal stitching ;" said he. "As I live, you are boring holes&#xD;
in that piece of cloth, for the pleasure of sewing them up again'!&#xD;
No wonder womEh's work is never ended! What are you&#xD;
making ?"&#xD;
"A handkerchief." She displayed the corner, in which ,sh~&#xD;
was embroidering, "Carry Carleton."&#xD;
"Where are the others ?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Mrs. Dana is in the nursery; Carry asleep; Dr. Carleton&#xD;
and Arthur abroad."&#xD;
"Come, walk with me I" requested he. Any handkerchief,-&#xD;
a wedding niouchoir-can wait an hour."&#xD;
Their course 'was along the brink.of a deep ravine; over&#xD;
shadowed by large old trees; and bridged by fallen trunks.&#xD;
The sides were grass-grown, and at the bottom rolled the' rivulet,&#xD;
which had fretted out' the gorge; blending its complaining with&#xD;
the low rush of the wind through the forest.&#xD;
"'So' one feeling often wears away the soul4!" remarked&#xD;
Charley, reflectively. "Man is but clay after all 1"&#xD;

"No. I am still an unbeliever in the total corruption of our&#xD;
nature; a doctrine so opposed to reaso~z and experience, that I&#xD;
will usver ascent to it, if it is preached at me until doomsday.&#xD;
But this is a miserably unsatisfactory life t"'&#xD;
"Yet the world says you enjoy ii."&#xD;
"And do you, an adept in co4cea~nent, credit a man's outward&#xD;
show?~'&#xD;
"At least, I do not practise this accomplishment upon my&#xD;
friends; replied Ida, piqued. -&#xD;
"Did I say that you did? I am not sure that I eould not&#xD;
proveAhis point, too ;-but we will let it pass for the present.&#xD;
I believe you to be what you appear to me. 'Carry would never&#xD;

Ge\~maine say ?"&#xD;
~his was a gentleman of the neighbourhood, whose marked&#xD;
att~ntions to Ida subjected her to the raillery of the' Poplar-&#xD;
gro~e household.&#xD;
"Nonsense I" said she, laughing. "lie has never, been&#xD;
beyond the outermost court of my heart."&#xD;
"I own his does not appear 'likely to be the hand to unlock&#xD;
the penetralia.' This is the spot I waited to show you. Is it&#xD;

It was a mossy bank at the foot of a venerable sycamo e, froti&#xD;
whose branches the trailing vines touched their heads.' sprint&#xD;
of the clearest crystal bubbled among its roots.&#xD;
"Oh! for a fairy goblet'!" said Ida.&#xD;
"It is easily made, if these leaves are large enough," answered&#xD;
Charley. He gathered some, but they were too irregularly-&#xD;
shaped to suit his purpose. '" It is a simple process," said he,&#xD;
as he failed, after several trials, to convey a thimbleful of water&#xD;
to his amused companion; "but as the man said who tried to&#xD;
fly and couldn't.~-"t)iere is every thing in knowing how' to do it.'&#xD;
I never like to be outdone, even in trifles. I saw some 'leaves as&#xD;
we came along that I know will do.-excuse me a moment, and&#xD;
He was g.ue before she could object; aud she strolled idly&#xD;
around the giant trunk of the ~ycaniore, admiring the al fresco&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       213&#xD;
boudoir, of which it was the centre ornament. She set her foot&#xD;
upon something harder than the soft carpet-it was a small&#xD;
morocco case, which she pic1~ed up, with an ejaculation of sur-&#xD;
prise, and without a thought of who had dropped it, opened.&#xD;
She had nearly let it fall, as Carry's lovely face smiled at her&#xD;
from within. "Arthur has been here,", was hei comment, but&#xD;
a glossy curl entwined itself from an envelope labelled in Charley's&#xD;
hand-" The seat under the honeysuckle. May 1st, 18-," a&#xD;
date four years back. There was no impropriety in his having&#xD;
Carry's likeness ;-they had long been in feeling what they&#xD;
were shortly to become in name-brother and sister; but her&#xD;
heart beat so with indefinable terror that she could not stand;-&#xD;
it was as though, instead of the senseless case, another heart, its&#xD;
every throbbing revealed, lay in her hand.&#xD;
"You are tired waiting, I suppose, but I had a. longer search&#xD;
than-"&#xD;
The glow of a stormy sunset rushed to his face as he saw, the&#xD;
miniature she dia not attempt to conceal. She had never con-&#xD;
ceived of the dormant passion which, now awoke in his eye and&#xD;
form; but she 'did not quail.&#xD;
"I found this over there, and opened it thoughtlessly, not&#xD;
suspecting what it was or to whom it belonged. I am very&#xD;
Sorry."&#xD;
The 'storm passed while she was speal~ing. The man's wonder-&#xD;
ful self-command was master. lie dipped up the water with a&#xD;
careful hand; the leafy cup did not quiver.&#xD;
"'Do you like it? is it cool ?"&#xD;
"Yes-~thank you."&#xD;
He drank draught after draught himself, threw away the leaves,&#xD;
and resumed his seat upon the bank.&#xD;
"There is no help for it, Ida I you must hear what I did not&#xD;
intend you ever should; not that I disdain your sympathy, but&#xD;
it is a rule with me not to disturb my friends with troubles, which&#xD;
they cannot alleviate. I do not know what suspicions have been&#xD;
forced upon you; if they are of the~honor and affection I owe my&#xD;
brother, or of her fidelity to him, they are groundless. That&#xD;
picture was painted for me befor~ I had any intimation that his&#xD;
was the prize I foolishly hoped to secure. I rehnqui8hed 'her;&#xD;
iut this is the amulet 'which has saved me in many -temtations.&#xD;

&#xD;
Although hope' was no more, memory remained; and vice eould&#xD;
not mate with the visions of purity that memory recalled. There&#xD;
has not been a time since I first saw her, a laughing babe, just&#xD;
liberated from her nurse's' arms, when I have not loved her more&#xD;
than' any other earthly being.' As boy and man I have thought,&#xD;
studied, labor~i for her alone. When I quitted home to seek&#xD;
my fortune, she was still a child, who clung weepingly to me,&#xD;
and. kissed me as fondly as she did her father. It was the last&#xD;
time.!' At my next visit she was away at school ;-at the second&#xD;
I obtained that curl. She was then fifteen; innocent and loving,&#xD;
full of jesting surprise at 'Charley's mannish ways,' and hurt&#xD;
that I would not. call her 'sister.' She did not ask this the&#xD;
ensuing summer. Lynn was with me; and in the confidence of&#xD;
a hope that saw no cloud ahead, I imparted to him 'my dreams&#xD;
and desires, and engaged him to take her portrait secretly. I&#xD;
went back to New York, and wrote to her father, asking his&#xD;
sanction of the proposal I could not delay. The letter was upon&#xD;
my desk, ready for the post~ when one arrived from Arthur. He&#xD;
was not, to blame for his silence.; I had been as reserved to him;&#xD;
but he entreated my forgiveness for hiding this, his only secret,&#xD;
from me. She knew it now ;.-her father's only objection was&#xD;
their youth-a 'fault,' he remarked, j9cosely, 'which will mend&#xD;
with time.' In place of the letter to my guardian, I forwarded&#xD;
one to my brother, congratulating him upon his happy engage-&#xD;
ment to the woman I idolized. lIe is worthy of her, if a mortal&#xD;
can be. I can see that it is best. He has talents and energy,&#xD;
and loves her as she should' be loved-I am rough and eccentric,&#xD;
caring and striving for nothing, now that my guiding star has set."&#xD;
." Charley ! OJ~arley! you shall not so defame yourself!" cried&#xD;
Ida bursting, into tears. "You-the kindest-most 'generous&#xD;
df men! you' are worthy of her! Oh! I wish it could be 1"&#xD;
"Hush! hush! I would not have it otherwise.' I came home&#xD;
last summer, and saw them together without a. pang of seJfish&#xD;
regret; and gloried in my subjugation of ~ passion their betrothal&#xD;
made sinful, until our ride to 'the Castle.' My arm' saved' her&#xD;
from mutilation or death, and instead of thanksgiving, sprang&#xD;
up. a horrible envy, that I had rescued her for kim. It was&#xD;
rnomentaryi~ut the repentance was bitter. I abhor myself&#xD;
when I think of it.' I lia~z~over 'fancied 0ince that I did not&#xD;
&#xD;
love her. I know it as well now that another month will&#xD;
make her his bride, as I did when ~ope was highest. Poor Lynn!&#xD;
it grieved him to his dying day I"&#xD;
Silence and tears was a fitting reply to this narration. It&#xD;
came to Ida, like sudden death to a festival; producing not only&#xD;
sorrow and dismay, but a trembling insecurlty-~an awful whis-&#xD;
per-" Who next?" Did human love, then, always terminate&#xD;
in misery'? Was there no remedy? She wanted Oharley to speak&#xD;
again, and say that he had some source of comfort; or at least,&#xD;
strength for t~e last, greatest trial. His words put this hope to&#xD;
flight.&#xD;
"I have borne as much as I can;-if it be cowardly to avert&#xD;
further suffering, I am not brave. I have business in the West&#xD;
next month, which could, but shall not be postponed. John will&#xD;
not know of it in time to provide a substitute. Arthur will be&#xD;
disappointed; I would spare him this trifling pain, if I were cer~&#xD;
tam that I should not give him more by remaining. I shall not&#xD;
wear this after the marriage-I may become a castaway without&#xD;
it, for aught I know. When Lynn died, I said, 'My secret is&#xD;
buried with him.' I hav~ committed what the Machiavelis of~&#xD;
the day would call an unwise act," added he, smiling; 'consigned&#xD;
it to the keeping of a woman,.-but I have no fears for its safety&#xD;
with you. Do not let it prey upon your spirits~ I would not&#xD;
caution a less synipathetic najaire. Be happy, lda,.-4t is your&#xD;
manifest destiny; and I am still disinterested enough to 'rejoice&#xD;
with those who do rejoice..' The sun is setting-.--.you shall not&#xD;
go to the house with that woe.~begone face. Smile I ~r I don't&#xD;
stir."&#xD;
He laughed at her attempt. "Rather hysterical,-.-~with that&#xD;
sob treading upon its heels; but it will do. Come, sister I"&#xD;
Ida could have cried more heartily at an expression and&#xD;
tone, that reminded her of 'Lynn; but he was resolute in not&#xD;
allowing it.&#xD;
Carry was upon the pia~a. "My*dear friends I" cried she,&#xD;
running to meet them. "Wheee kave you been! here's a'h~use&#xD;
full of company, and I have sent scouts in every dfreotion. Did&#xD;
not you heax~' or see them ?~'&#xD;
"' I heard the owls scream, and the crickets cry;'" said&#xD;
Oharley. "Who is here, that We can prefer to each other's&#xD;
society ?"&#xD;

"Ih~esi~tible-more irresistible-most irresistible! Are you&#xD;

When the girls went down, it was candle-light; and the&#xD;
"Irrasistibles' were laughing themselves black in the face, over&#xD;
the piano~ an the "funniest of fellows," who was entertaining&#xD;
them by an original parody upon "Oh no! I never mention&#xD;

CHAPTER.XIX.&#xD;
CHARLEY departed, and: for several days, Ida disregarded his&#xD;
injunction of cheerfulness. She liked the warm-hearted, reliable&#xD;
Arthur; but she was unjust in her vexation at his happiness,&#xD;
w~ien she pictured the lonely brother, who had sacrificed his, to&#xD;
*      preserve it unabated. Her conscience~ reproached her for a dis-&#xD;
* ph~y of this impatience, while they were watching the, receding&#xD;
forix~ of their visitor. Arthur linked her arm in his, saying&#xD;
playfully, "Come, cousin Ida, tell us what made you and my&#xD;
i~attling brother so sober this morning. You parted as if you&#xD;
* did not expect to meet again in this world. Is there any hope&#xD;
of my claiming nearer kinship 7"&#xD;
With a quick, fretful gesture she broke from him; and although&#xD;
* she recovered herself immediately, and answered pleasantly, he&#xD;
*     was aniazed and wounded, and never repeated the familiarity.&#xD;
A letter from Mr. Lacy came opportunely to brighten the cur-&#xD;
rent of thought. She wished Charley could read it; but as this&#xD;
* was not to be, she emlndied its sentiments in her reply to a&#xD;
oouununioation she had~ received from him. She was in the&#xD;
habit of moralisfug speculatively; and he had no clue to betray&#xD;
from what quarter this practical strain had emanated.&#xD;
John arrived' a week before the* marriage, with intelligence&#xD;
that uet the house ii~ a turnwil; Charley had started to Missouri&#xD;
&#xD;
AILO NE.&#xD;
&#xD;
217&#xD;
&#xD;
that morning. He "was the bearer of his excuses. ~nd the&#xD;
bridal gift." Cai~ry wept; and Arthur was indignant; Dr.&#xD;
Carleton proposed s~ postponement, which was unanimously voted&#xD;
'for by the servants. ".Twouldn't be no wedding wuth talking&#xD;
about, 'thout Mars' Charles was thar !" The motion was strenu-&#xD;
ously opposed b~ a minority of three-John, Ida and Arthur;&#xD;
John asserting, in his business way, that the ceremony could&#xD;
be performed ~is well without the absented; and that his example&#xD;
of punctuality in keeping engagements should be improved. The&#xD;
two others deprecated a change, without distinctly stating their&#xD;
reasons. They carried the day. Poplar-grove was visible for&#xD;
miles around, on the moonless night of the bridaL Lights blazed&#xD;
in every window; starry festoons depended from the trees; and&#xD;
in the garden, the glow-worm fairies might have been celebrating&#xD;
the royal birth-night. In doors, the scene was one of bewilder-&#xD;
ing beauty. Fairies of mortal mould'fiitted through the summer&#xD;
bowers, at whose decoration, Flora must have presided in person.&#xD;
Carry was too modest to covet display; but Dr. Carleton was&#xD;
wealthy. and liberal; and Ida abd Mrs. Dana, who were both&#xD;
fond of splendor and excitement, had his hearty concurrence in&#xD;
their designs. The former planned everything. It was a new&#xD;
business to her; but she struck out boldly, copying a gorgeous&#xD;
conception of her fertile b~a.in, guided solely by her eye and&#xD;
judgment. Her subordinates marvelled at first; but had too&#xD;
much faith in her to rebel; and as the idea was developed, their&#xD;
industry and delight surpassed her expectations. When com-&#xD;
pleted, the effect wa~ so novel and pleasing, they were ready to fall&#xD;
down and worship her;~ and more cultivated taste did not derogate&#xD;
from their eulogistic approbation. Dr. Carleton thanked her with&#xD;
moistened eyes; Arthurlaughingly wondered.--"what talent next?&#xD;
her versatile genius kept him in a state of perpetual wonderment;"&#xD;
but Carry's silent kiss was dearer praise than all. As first brides-&#xD;
maid, and an inmate of the mansion, she was virtually mistress of&#xD;
the ceremonies; Mrs. Dana confining her attention to the arrange..&#xD;
mont of the banquet, dressing-rooms and chambers. Carry had&#xD;
invited all of her schoolmates who were within reach; among those&#xD;
who came, were Anna Talbot, Emma Glenn, Ellen Morris, who wa#&#xD;
staying at Mr. Truman's, and our old friend Celestia ;-.." cousin&#xD;
Lucindy" being again conveniently remembered,. The three first&#xD;

218                    A L 0 N T~&#xD;
named, were bridesmaids. Ida walked with Mr. Euston; and&#xD;
as the train formed, she thought of the two who would have&#xD;
taken precedence of him'; of the chilly sleep of the pulseless&#xD;
heart, and the desolation of the living one; while the irrevo-&#xD;
cable words were said, she heard, like the echo of a knell---&#xD;
"caring for nothing, striving for nothing-now that my guiding&#xD;
atar has s9t;" and the sigh, which contended with her smile of&#xD;
sali~tation to the bride, was "poor Charley !"&#xD;
Ellen Morris, too, may have had her reminiscences; this&#xD;
event could not but revive the recollection of her sister's bridal,&#xD;
not year before; but the sparkling hazel orbs were unshadowed&#xD;
as t en; er manner as charmingly coquettish. Celestial had&#xD;
not forgotten Mr. Euston; and seized an early opportunity to&#xD;
renew their flirtation. The gentleman was not so willing; he&#xD;
was not exactly in love with his partner; but was not insensible&#xD;
to her attractions, and that in his position he was envied by most&#xD;
of th~ single men present-cordially hated by one. Ida knew&#xD;
not th\it he was taxing every energy to achieve fascination. She&#xD;
felt th~ nervousness of a youthful hostess that things should "go&#xD;
off" well; the company be pleased with their reception and them-&#xD;
selves; conscious, that although the praise or censure might not&#xD;
be pu.t upon her, yet in reality the result depended upon her&#xD;
exertions. Solicitude yielded to triumphant satisfaction, as the&#xD;
electric sympathy spread, leaping from tongue to tongue; and&#xD;
evolving, in dazzling coruscations, from kindling eyes. She did&#xD;
not seek her reward then, but she had it. Few were so blind&#xD;
and ungrateful, as not to recognize her h~nid in the pleasures&#xD;
offered to them. The girls, the most fastidious of the various&#xD;
classes for whose whims a party-giver has to cater, forgave her&#xD;
magnet influence upon the choicest beaux, as they were theme&#xD;
selves well-supplied notwithstanding; the old people were charmed&#xD;
with her respectful affability; and of her immediate attendants,&#xD;
there was not one who was not convinced that 'he contributed&#xD;
most to her amusement.&#xD;
fl~iature is indigenous to all soils, and spite creates its ~wi~&#xD;
food; and she did Ilot escape wholly unscathed. She., '&#xD;
the epithets, "flirt," and "dashing," in the same ~ ~&#xD;
her name; but she laughed at the silly shot. If she fir&#xD;
QUO was offended or injured; if she dashed7 she did it with i~&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                        219&#xD;
grace er maligners t4ed vainly to copy. As she left the supper-&#xD;
room, a glance at the hall-mirror showed that her head-dress&#xD;
was disordered; and she repaired to the dressing-room to rectify&#xD;
it. She paused be1~ore the glass there, in unfeigned~wonder at&#xD;
the reflected figure. It was the first time a spark of personal&#xD;
vanity had ever inflamed her mind. She knew that she was&#xD;
admired; she believed, because she amused people by her&#xD;
sprightly repartee; compliments upon her appearance were for~&#xD;
gotten as soon as heard, leaving, as their only trace, contempt&#xD;
for their author. To-night, the thoughtful eyes were alive with&#xD;
* light;, the cheeks, usually colorless, as rosy as Carry's; and the&#xD;
wreathing smile imparted a wondrous beauty to the proud lips.&#xD;
.A softer, sweeter happiness succeeded the girlish exultation-&#xD;
pardonable since it was short-lived-she turned from the mirror~&#xD;
with indifference, as she murmured-&#xD;
"Young, loving and beloved!&#xD;
These are brief words, but-"&#xD;
An exclamation interrupted the quotation. She snatched up a&#xD;
letter from the table. "It must have come this afternoon, and&#xD;
they forgot to give it me. How unkind I". This was too public&#xD;
a place, there was constant passing in and out; but she could&#xD;
not be debarred its perusal until the guests' departure. A closet&#xD;
opened beyond the chamber; she carried a lamp in thither, and&#xD;
bolted the door. H~ wrote kindly, but more cqnstrainedly than&#xD;
formerly; and the s~nse of some phrases was confused, as if he&#xD;
had commenced the~, meaning to sayone thing, and changed&#xD;
his mind ere the conclusiQn. His sister had been very ill, he&#xD;
said, but was now out of danger~; and his' statement of this&#xD;
simple fact appeared embarrassed. She read two pages in, per~&#xD;
plexity whether to chide his ambiguity, or her unsettled&#xD;
thoughts; "And new, my dear friend," so ran 'the third, "I&#xD;
have to solicit indulgence for my egotism, while I speak of an&#xD;

were merciful. There is nothing earthly which can compare&#xD;
with the love of a true-hearted woman.-If I ever needed an&#xD;
incentive to industry I have it in this. Months-years, perhaps&#xD;
must elapse before our union. It may be said, I have not&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
"I NEVER thought you unreasonable before, Ida."&#xD;
"I am sorry you should now, Carry."&#xD;
"How can I help it, when after travelling with. us for weeks&#xD;
you suddenly resolve to return to Eastern Virginia by yourself;&#xD;
and to that lonesome place in the country, which you have not&#xD;
visited for years !"&#xD;
"I have an escort; a gentleman who is on his way to Rich-&#xD;
mond, and will take charge of me.&#xD;
"But why this notion, just as we decided to go north 1' Has&#xD;
your curiosity to behold Niagara diminished~ since your sight of&#xD;
'the Bridge?'"&#xD;
"Frankly and truly, I do not care to see it. I would 'not&#xD;
ride to the House Mountain yonder, if Mont Blanc, the Lake of&#xD;
Como, and the Great Fall were to be seen from the other side."&#xD;
"iDo you hear t1~at, Arthur ?" said Carry,. despairingly, to her&#xD;
husband, who was reading.&#xD;
." No.-.--what is it ?"&#xD;
"This obstinate young lady is about to deprive us of the&#xD;
honour of her company. She is going back to Staunton to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
"To the Lunatic Hospital ?" inquired Arthur, putting aside&#xD;
his book. "You are not in earnest, Ida? Are you tired of&#xD;
us; or do you dislike our sketched route? If the last, we will&#xD;
alter it."&#xD;
"And if the first, we will alter ourselves," interposed Carry,&#xD;
laughingly.&#xD;
"I would have you and your plans remain as they are. I am&#xD;
not well, and require rest-not change. My desire to see old&#xD;
Sunnybank is not a caprice, as Carry supposes; I have had it in&#xD;
contemplation for a long time. Mr. Read deterred me from it'&#xD;
by representations of the discomfort I would encounter; the&#xD;
only white man left on the plantation being the overseer. This&#xD;
summer he has been removed, and his place given to a former&#xD;

which serve for them, will keep me from hardship.7'&#xD;
"She is sick," said Carry, when Ida retired.' "She has not&#xD;
been herself lately. Were it not that she is used to dissipation,&#xD;
I should think that the round of parties, after our wedding, over-&#xD;
tasked her strength. Yet, she enjoyed them!'&#xD;
"Her malady may be of the mind," said Dr. Dana, thought..&#xD;
fully. "Do you consider this probable ?"&#xD;
"Oh, no! she was well and happy when she came to us; and&#xD;
what can have occurred since to affect her ?"&#xD;
"You are right, I dare say;" returned he, absently. He was&#xD;
pondering upon her behaviour after Charley's departure.&#xD;
Argum did not dissuade, and conjecture was baffled in the&#xD;
effort to explain this unexpected movement. They parted in&#xD;
Lexington.-~-Ida to recross the mountains eastward; they, to&#xD;
travel north by way of, Harper's Ferry.&#xD;
If there is an enjoyment, which is purely of the intellect, its&#xD;
usurpation is man's 'high prerogative; the sticklers for woman's&#xD;
"equal rights" will never establish her title to it. The mind&#xD;
masculine may be nourished and exercised, and attain its full&#xD;
size, while the heart is dwarfed and sickly;-as 'with twin&#xD;
children,, one sometimes grows to man's stature, healthy and&#xD;
strong; and the other pines and dies in childhood. In woman,&#xD;
intellect and the affections are united from their birth ;-~-like&#xD;
the Siamese brothers, one refuses food, which is denied its om-&#xD;
panion; and who dare peril the life of both by' severing the&#xD;
ligament which joins them?&#xD;
Ida's route was through the garden-spot of ~ur State+the&#xD;
magnificent Valley, with its heaven-bathed, impregnable e~fries,&#xD;
among which our country's Father selected a resting- lace&#xD;
for Freedom's st~ndard-American Thermopyla3, should the&#xD;
invader's power drive him~ from every other hold* one&#xD;

ridges stretch, in amity, towards each other- each rolling its&#xD;
streams and clouds down to the verdant plains between ;-where&#xD;
morning and evening, the sun marshals his crimson and gold-&#xD;
colored array upon the ~purple heights, which are coeval with&#xD;
him and Time; and flings shadows and hues athwart them, in&#xD;

&#xD;
A L ONE .&#xD;
&#xD;
228&#xD;
&#xD;
and this region was traversed with not a thought beyond a&#xD;
feverish wish to be at her journey's end and rest. She stopped&#xD;
in Richmond but one night. Mr. Read and his daughter were&#xD;
out of town, and she went to a hotel. At dawn~she was upon&#xD;
the road, with no attendant but the driver of her hack. Rachel&#xD;
had gone to Sunnybank a month before, to see her relations,&#xD;
little expecting her mistress to come for her. Ida's spirits and&#xD;
health declined alarmingly, now that the necessity of eluding&#xD;
suspicion was over. She had never been sick a day in her life;&#xD;
but she began to feel that mental ills may be aggravated by&#xD;
bodily disease. The unnatural tension had been. maintained too&#xD;
long. When Sunnybank appeared, she was uua~bJe to raise her&#xD;
head to look at it. The negroes flocked out at the phenomenon&#xD;
of a travelling carriage in the disused avenue; and loud were&#xD;
their astonishment and compassion, as they recognized its&#xD;
occupant.&#xD;
"I have come home to dk~, mother," said she, a~ they lifted&#xD;
her out, and fainted in their arms. 'In the midst of their con-&#xD;
sternation, the family pride of the faithful underlings was&#xD;
stubborn. "Their young mistress should not be carried to the&#xD;
overseer's ;" and Aunt Judy, the keeper of the keys, hurried off&#xD;
to unlock the hcuse doors. Ida had a' cloudy remembrance of&#xD;
awakening in' her mother's chamber, and of a gleaming fancy,&#xD;
that she was once more a child, aroused from a horrid, horrid&#xD;
dream, then her senses forsook her, and there was a wide hiatus&#xD;
in memory. It was night when she awoke again; she was in&#xD;
the same room ;-a fire burned in the chimney, and cast fan~&#xD;
tactic shapes upon the ceiling. CrQuched in the corner of the&#xD;
fire-place, was a dusky figure, whose audible breathing sounded&#xD;
loudly through the apartment. Her 'slumbers were not very&#xD;
profound, however, for she sprang up at the feeble call-.&#xD;
"Rachel !"&#xD;
"Miss Ida! honey! what do you want ?"&#xD;
"How long have I slept? my head feels so strange I"&#xD;
"That's because you've been sick, honey."&#xD;
"What is the matter with me&#xD;
"Fever, dear-you cat~ght it in them dreadful mountains,&#xD;
and have been laid up for our weeks. But you'll git well, now&#xD;
--you were out of your he~d 'most all the time--and the doctor'&#xD;
says you mustn't talk.7~&#xD;

&#xD;
Ida desisted, too weak to disobey. With vague curiosity, she&#xD;
followed her with her eyes, as she smoothed the counterpane,&#xD;
pushed up the bed on one side, and patted it down on the other;&#xD;
then sh~ put the "chunks" together upon the hearth, and there&#xD;
was the clinking of spoons and glasses at a table.&#xD;
"Here's your drink, Miss Ida," she said, lifting her head&#xD;
with a care that proved her a practiced nurse. It was cool and&#xD;
palatable, and the heavy lids sank in natural slumber.&#xD;
Mr. Grant (the overseer) and his wife had not been remiss in&#xD;
their duty to the sick girl. She had the best medical attendance&#xD;
the county afforded; and Mr. Read was written to at The corn-&#xD;
mencement of the attack; the letter was unanswered-probably&#xD;
not received. Rachel was "sure Miss Jenny or Miss Carry&#xD;
would come in a minute, if they knew she was sick ;" but was&#xD;
ignorant of the address of either. Their nursing might have&#xD;
been iziore skilful, but it could not have exceeded hers in tender-&#xD;
~iess. She took turns, with Mrs. Grant in watching, but she&#xD;
never left the room except for her meals. She was amply repaid&#xD;
for her labor of love by the improvement which henceforward&#xD;
was apparent in her patient. Her raptures awoke no responsive&#xD;
harmony in Ida's boso~n.&#xD;
Her physician was a son of Mr. Hall, the old minister, who&#xD;
had gone to his rest.&#xD;
"You must exert yourself, Miss Ida," said he. "Have you&#xD;
walked yet ?"&#xD;
" No, sir."&#xD;
"Cannot you do it ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, indeed, sir."&#xD;
"But, my dear child, nature cannot do everything; we must&#xD;
aid her. It is as binding upon us 'to save our own lives, as those&#xD;
of others."&#xD;
"When they are worth saving."&#xD;
"You want more powerful tonics than any I have ;" said the&#xD;
doctor, eyeing her curiously. "I must think your case over.&#xD;
I command you to walk across the roQm twice to-day, three&#xD;
times to-morrow, and so on. Se~ thatshe minds me, Rachel !"~&#xD;
'in Rachel gave her no peace, until she consented to sit up awhile&#xD;
easy-chair, by the window. Sunnybank was sadly changed.&#xD;
~he buildings and enclosures were in good repair, and the fields&#xD;
&#xD;
cultivated; hut the walks and shr(~bbery were neglected; and&#xD;
the garden, into which Ida was loi~king, overgrown with high&#xD;
weeds. Here and there a rose~tree struggled for a foothold, a&#xD;
scanty growth of yellow leaves clinging to the mossy stems; the&#xD;
sweetbrier still hung over the window, its long, bare arms rat1.&#xD;
tling in the cold wind like fleshless hones; the tangled grass in&#xD;
the yard had run to seed, and piles of dead leaves were heaped&#xD;
against the palings. She could not see the grave-yard; she&#xD;
knew, though, that the willows were leafless, and how the spray~&#xD;
were waving in their melancholy dance, and whispering their old&#xD;
song-" Alone 1" If alone then, how now? sick-dying, per-&#xD;
haps I where were those who had proudly borne the name of&#xD;
friend? where the sister, in whose bosom she had lain for&#xD;
months, and eased her sorrows and heightened het~ joys? the&#xD;
brother, she had averred, was "all kindness and truth ?" and&#xD;
oh! where he, who had filled her heart to the brim with the&#xD;
rich, red wine of life, to change, in a moment, to fiery, deadly&#xD;
poison I She felt no resentment against him; she was too&#xD;
utterly broken-hearted, she thought, even if she had cause; and&#xD;
~he had not. Her wilful self-deception had been her snare;&#xD;
instead qf studying his heart, she had judged it by her own.&#xD;
Were his canaor-~--his undisguised interest in her welfare, tokens&#xD;
of love, that ever seeks concealment? No! he had tried to lead&#xD;
her, a wayward child, to the paths of happiness; and she had&#xD;
seen nought but the hand which pointed the way. There was&#xD;
prophetic meaning in Lynn's eye, when he spoke of "the finest&#xD;
growth of heart and soul, which you flattered yourself were climb-&#xD;
ing heavenward, twining with strengthening tendrils around the&#xD;
altar of that one love I" She had been impious enough to iina~&#xD;
gine that she was imbibing a fondness for holy thingA; her heart&#xD;
had burned within her, as he talked of the loved theme; she&#xD;
had read the Scriptures, and prayed, in words, for light and&#xD;
guidance. And by the fierce rebellion which fired her breast-.&#xD;
rebellion against-hatred of the Being, this lip service had bIas-&#xD;
~hemed, she knew that she had never bowed in soul to Him;&#xD;
and her heart-broken, though she said it was,-trusting still-&#xD;
adoring still the mortal, through the great love she bore him-.--.&#xD;
yet reared itself in angry defiance, saying to the Chastener,-" I&#xD;
will not submit"' What had she done, to he left desolate--.&#xD;

comfortless in the spring.4irne of life! "lie is, they tell&#xD;
merciful and all-powerful ;-let Him give me back my love, and&#xD;
I will believe in him." And as day, by day passed, and there&#xD;
were no tidings of Carry or. the iDanas, she felt a~ morose com-&#xD;
placency in the confirmation. of her hard thoughts of them, and&#xD;
in repeating, "I am not humbled yet I"&#xD;
"Uncle Will wants to know if he can come in to see you,&#xD;
Miss Ida," said Rachel, one Sabbath afternoon.&#xD;
Ida was dressed, and rocking herself listlessly before the fire.&#xD;
"Let him come," she replied, languidly.&#xD;
This man was her mother's steward and factotum; a hale,&#xD;
fine-looking negro; better educated than the generality of his&#xD;
caste, and devotedly pious. He brushed off a tear with the&#xD;
back of his hand, as his mistress greeted him. He had not&#xD;
seen her since she was grown, and was moved by her likeness to&#xD;
her mother.&#xD;
"You would not have known me,-would you, uncle Will ?"&#xD;
she asked.&#xD;
"Yes ma'am~ you are your mother's own child."&#xD;
"Indeed! I am called like my father."&#xD;
"You're like her, ma'am-in body, and like her in spirit) too&#xD;
I hops."&#xD;
"No, Uncle Will, you cannot expect that ;-she was an&#xD;
angeL"&#xD;
"Better than that, Mistis-she was a Christian I"&#xD;
." And how is that better ?" said Ida, surprised at the reply.&#xD;
"She is an angel now-is she not ?"&#xD;
"No ma'am; she is one of the spirits of the j~ist made perfect;&#xD;
and according to my notion, that's better than to be a born&#xD;
seraph. Angels may praise and glorify the Lamb, but they&#xD;
have'iit so much to be thankful for as we."&#xD;
"I do. not understand you. They have been happy from* all&#xD;
Eternity; and those who have lived in this world, have had&#xD;
sorrow and pain and sin-' mourning al4 their days."'&#xD;
"They needn't, ma'am-&#xD;
'Why should the children of a King&#xD;
Go mourning all their days?"'&#xD;
paid Will readily-" He holds us up under whatever trouble We&#xD;
have; unless we bring it upon ourselves by our transgressions,&#xD;

A L ON E.&#xD;
&#xD;
227&#xD;
&#xD;
and. He will deliver us then, if we call to Him.' The Saviour&#xD;
is the Christian's glory and song-He didn't. die for angels.'~'&#xD;
Ida mused. "There is a question I wish t~ ask you," said&#xD;
she. "God can do as He pleases ;-can He not ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, Mistis-' He worketh according to the counsel&#xD;
of His own will.'"&#xD;
"And He is very pitiful and gracious ?" she continued.&#xD;
"Like as a father pitieth his children, 'Mistis.'"&#xD;
"Then when He knows that we are miserable and sinful and&#xD;
helpless, why does not He take pity on us, and make us good&#xD;
and happy ?"&#xD;
" He will, ma~ ~&#xD;
"But He does not. lie only waits for us to love anything,&#xD;
before He robs us of it. So far from liking to see us happy, it&#xD;
would seem that He grudged us the poor crumbs we picked up&#xD;
of ourselves."&#xD;
"Because they ain't good for us, Mistis."&#xD;
"Why did He allow us to take them, then? why waW, until&#xD;
we have tasted and found them sweet, before He snatches them&#xD;
away?"&#xD;
"I remember, Mistis, when you were a little thing, no higher&#xD;
than my knee, you were .mightily taken with some red peppers&#xD;
growing in the garden. Your mother called you away from the&#xD;
bed, four or five times, and ordered you not to touch them. . By&#xD;
and by .1 spied you running down the walk towards them, when&#xD;
you thought she didn't see you; and I was starting in a hurry&#xD;
to fetch you back, but she stopped me. 'No1 Will 1' says she,&#xD;
'the punishment sin brings with it, is remembered longer than&#xD;
a hundred warnings. She will have a useful lesson.' I was&#xD;
loath to have you hurt; but I had to mind her.. YQur lesson&#xD;
was right hard; for your mouth and face and hands were swelled&#xD;
and burning for hours. But.you didn't go near the pepper-bed&#xD;
again. And it seems to me, ma'am, that the Almighty treats&#xD;
us- just so. We run crazy after things, that are like the red&#xD;
peppers,-pretty outside, but hot as fire when we get to playing&#xD;
with them. He doesn't push us towards them-Ile lets us alone;&#xD;
and we are mighty apt to run to Him, after we've got a fair taste.&#xD;
You didn't know but your mother would whip you for disobey-.&#xD;
ing her; but you went straight tqher when you felt the smart."&#xD;

&#xD;
"This does not~ follow, of course, uncle Will. I have tasted&#xD;
some hot peppers since those days; and I cannot see any mercy&#xD;
or use in the lesson."&#xD;
" Maybe you haven't asked an explanation, ma'am."&#xD;
"From whom? from you ?"&#xD;
"No ma'am! From Him, unto '~rhom belong the deep things&#xD;
of the Almighty. And if He doesn't show you their meaning&#xD;
now-He will, sometime. Children are often puzzled at their&#xD;
parents' dealings?'&#xD;
As he was leaving, she observed his, wistful look.&#xD;
"Have you any requests to make, uncle Will? you will not&#xD;
ask anything unreasonable, I know."&#xD;
"I hope not, ma'am. You see-we've been in the habit of&#xD;
holding our Sunday night prayer-meetings in the basement-room,&#xD;
under this. We used to meet there in your mother's time. She&#xD;
had the room fixed on purpose for us. When it's clear weather,&#xD;
in summer, we meet out-doors ;-its getting cool now-"&#xD;
"And. you are afraid of disturbing me; is that it ?"&#xD;
"Yes ma'am," said he, relieved.&#xD;
"You may be quite easy as regards that. Has that- room&#xD;
been coiled yet ?"&#xD;
"No ma'am-~-'twould have been if-you all had stayed&#xD;
here.~,&#xD;
"I am glad that it is not. I can hear your hymns-how I&#xD;
used to love those old tunes! Have your meetitig. I wish I&#xD;
had no other disturbance I"&#xD;
He had got into the entry, when she recalled him; and with&#xD;
the sad smile she . had worn during their conversation, said,&#xD;
"Uncle Will! if you think I have not done hankering after for-&#xD;
bidden fruit, you may pray, that I may be cured."&#xD;
"I will, Mistis! God bless you 1"&#xD;
She had forgotten, and Will did not know, that all the services&#xD;
could be heard through the floor. The, worshippers assembled&#xD;
so quietly, that she was not aware of this, until Will's tones&#xD;
startled her with the idea that he was in the room. He com-&#xD;
menced the exercises by reading the fourteenth chapter of John's&#xD;
gospel. "Let not your hearts be troubled; ye believe in God,&#xD;
believe also in me." lie offered neither comment nor explana-&#xD;
tion. He was a believer in what he called "the pure Word ;"&#xD;
&#xD;
"if I can't comprehend one part," he was wont to say, cdl com~&#xD;
fort myself by thinking that there is so much that is plain even&#xD;
to my weak understanding." The quavering voice of an aged&#xD;
man led in prayer; and in spite of its verbiage and incorrect&#xD;
grammar, Ida listened, for it was sincere. They sang in, the&#xD;
sweet voices for which the race is so. remarkable,&#xD;
"There is a laud of pure delight,"&#xD;
with a wild, beautiful chorus, repeated each time with more&#xD;
emphasis and ferior-&#xD;
"Oh sing to me of Heaven!.&#xD;
In Heaven alone, no sin is known,&#xD;
And there's no parting there !"&#xD;
Ida shut her, eyes and lay motionless, lest she should lose a&#xD;
note. Forgetful of her unholy enmity to her God-her distrust&#xD;
of her kind-borne upon the melody h~r soul arose to Pisgah's&#xD;
top, and looked yearningly upon the "sweet fields beyond the&#xD;
swelling flood," heard the jubi~1ant song of the redeemed-&#xD;
"In Heaven alone, no sin is known,&#xD;
And there's no parting there 1"&#xD;
A solemn hush followed; and WiTh-Said, "Let us pray."&#xD;
His deliberate accents quickened into animation, with the unfold-&#xD;
ing of his petitions; spurning the fetters of his imperfect speech,&#xD;
his thoughts clothed themselves in the language, of the Divine&#xD;
Word; coming to a King, he adopted unconsciously the ver-&#xD;
nacular of princes. In speaking of Ida, his manner was ear-&#xD;
nestly affectionate. "We beseech Thee, 0 Father, to deal&#xD;
gently with thine~ handmaid, whom thou hast set over us, in&#xD;
worldly things. Thou hast seen fit that she should bear the&#xD;
yoke in her youth, hast made her to possess wearisome nights,&#xD;
and days of vanity; hast mingled her bread with tears, and her&#xD;
drink with weeping; Thou hast' taken from her father and&#xD;
mother,--the hope of her soul, and the desire of her eyes; it is&#xD;
the Lord's doings, and it is marvellous in our eyes and in hers.&#xD;
Lighten her eyes, Our Father! tb hugh weeping has endured for&#xD;
a night, Thou hast. promised that joy shall come in the morning;&#xD;
tell her, that no affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but&#xD;
grievous; but that Thou wilt make it work out for her an eternal&#xD;
weight of glory; that whom Thou lowest Thou chasteneth, and&#xD;

far country in which she has been living, and may He he~A her&#xD;
broken bones, give her the oil of gladness for mourning--the&#xD;
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness."&#xD;
The hot, dry channel was broken up, and tears flowed in plen-&#xD;
teous measure. From the sqftening soul sprang her first real&#xD;
prayer. "Oh! be my Father and Comforter !"&#xD;
When Rachel awoke in 'the morning, she saw that her mis-&#xD;
tress had unbarred the shutters of the window by her bed, and&#xD;
was reading. Her face had a still deeper shade of gloom; but&#xD;
the attached girl drew a favorable augury from this mark of&#xD;
interest in anything, except her own thoughts. The book was a&#xD;
mother's gift-a Bible; 'she had read it with tolerable regularity&#xD;
for the giver's sake,~but she found herself now lamentably igno-&#xD;
rant of its contents. She read of the unapproachable purity of&#xD;
the Immaculate, of judgment and justice; denunciation of the&#xD;
wicked, and the "fearful looking for of vengeance" that remained&#xD;
to rebellious children; in v~dn she searched it for a message to&#xD;
her-a promise she could apply. Her alarm augmented, as the&#xD;
fruitlessness of her endeavors beca~ie apparent. The life she&#xD;
had, lightly esteemed was inestimab~y dear, as she realized what&#xD;
eternity was'; and her h~art was stifle with fear at the thought&#xD;
of the uncertain tenure 1y which she held it. Ii~ times past she&#xD;
would have blushed at these shakings of spirit; new she could&#xD;
not banish them. She *ould not be left alone an instant; she&#xD;
was afraid to sleep, lest she should not awake in time. She had&#xD;
said, "what evil have I done ?" she saw now that she had com-&#xD;
mitted evil, and that continually; a~ she beheld "idolatry,&#xD;
hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, envyings" in the same enu-&#xD;
meration with monstrous vices-a catalogue which brings to&#xD;
our ears the warring clash of Pandemonium, rendered more hor-&#xD;
*    ribly discordant by contrast with the gentle ~music of "Love, joy,&#xD;
peace, long-suffering."&#xD;
In angry despair she threw the volume aside; but tortured&#xD;
conscience drove her to it again. "I will be a Christian," was&#xD;
her primal resolve,-as the terrors of the law flamed before her.&#xD;
-" I muse be 1" and a week of labor and agony ended in a total&#xD;
sinking of hope, and an exhausted cry, "IL cannot I"&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                         231&#xD;
It was a calm Sabbath in the Indian Summer, an~ her chair&#xD;
was wheeled to the door. The "summer's late, repentant smile"&#xD;
shone fondly upon the landscape; the russet fields, the dis-&#xD;
mantled forests, the swift-rolling river.&#xD;
She had seen it look just so, often; when the breeze played&#xD;
among the child's curls, and lent a~ quicker bound to a light&#xD;
heart-h-but faded in body-prematuraly old in spirit-she saw&#xD;
no beauty in earth-had no treasure in heaven. Her Bible was&#xD;
upon her knees; she turned the pages indolently, and was say-&#xD;
irig, for the hundredth time, "No hope I" when a passage&#xD;
appeared to start up from the page. Could it have been there&#xD;
while she sought it carefully and with tears? "The Lord hath&#xD;
called thee as a woman, forsaken and grieved in spirit; a~id as a&#xD;
wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith my God. Ffr a&#xD;
small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will&#xD;
I gather thee; in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a&#xD;
moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy upon&#xD;
thee, saith the Lord; thy Redeemer. * * * * Oh! thou&#xD;
afflicted, tossed with tempests, and not comforted! behold, I will&#xD;
lay thy 'stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with&#xD;
sapphires 1"&#xD;
As Will passed under the window on his way to Church, he&#xD;
was arrested by an unusual. sound. No one was visible, but his&#xD;
heart and eyes ran over, as he recognized the voice that sang&#xD;
softly-&#xD;
Other refuge have I none,&#xD;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.;&#xD;
Leave, oh! leave me not alone,&#xD;
Still support and comfort me.&#xD;
All my trust on Thee is staid,&#xD;
All my help from Thee I bring;&#xD;
Cover my defenseless bead&#xD;
With the shadow of Thy wing."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
THE trembling which mingled with her transport, was so&#xD;
foreign to Ida's ardent temperament, that she doubted sometimes,&#xD;
if she had indeed found peace. But as her filial love and trust&#xD;
strengthened with time, she rejoiced with more hope. Much of&#xD;
the old leaven was left; her imperious temper still chafed at&#xD;
restraint, and she was disheartened at the discovery, that the&#xD;
7Ioveliest~ of the "Blessed Three" graces was most difficult to&#xD;
practise. She leaned upon a Saviour' s arm, and was willing to&#xD;
walk in the ways of His appointment, but the weak heart pleaded&#xD;
~ that He would not send her back into the world. Sweet Sunny-&#xD;
bank, rich in associations ;-with its peaceful duties and holy&#xD;
enjoyments, must be more favorable to the advancement of her&#xD;
new life ;-she hoped against hope, that she might be permitted&#xD;
to remain. A letter from her guardian settled' the points With&#xD;
laconic terseness, he declared the thing "impossible. By her&#xD;
father's will, the estate was hers, when she Vwas of age; until&#xD;
then, no preparatory step could be taken." Her scheme had&#xD;
been to invite a sister of Mrs. Grant, an excellent woman, now&#xD;
dependent upon her brother-in-law, to reside with her, in the&#xD;
capacity of housekeeper and companion; and leaving the control&#xD;
of her finances in Mi,. Read's hands, to devote herself to the&#xD;
improvement of her servants and poor neighbors. It was a praise-&#xD;
worthy enterprise, and it cost her a sharp pang to resign it, and&#xD;
prepare for the' return, her guardian pressed, "as desirable and&#xD;
proper." Her trunks were packed; and she had come in from&#xD;
a tour of the negro cabins, and u visit to her mother's grave, to&#xD;
spend the last twilight in the room in which she was born-in&#xD;
which her mother had died. The November blast howled in&#xD;
the chimney ;-here it was the music of early days ;-in Rich-&#xD;
inond, it would be so dreary!&#xD;
She was not gloomy, although the firelight glistened upon&#xD;
cheeks wet with tears ;-she was not going away, as she had&#xD;
come-alone; still she was s~d at quitting her retreat, and in the&#xD;
prospect of the temptations awaiting her. There would be trials,&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.         283&#xD;
&#xD;
too-trials of faith and patience and charity-and trials of feel-&#xD;
ing-what if she should be found wanting! But a whisper&#xD;
trancjuilised her-" Fear not-I am with thee 1" Mrs. Grant&#xD;
opened the door. She held a lamp whose rays blinded Ida's&#xD;
tender eyes.&#xD;
"A gentleman to see you, Miss Ida,-and as there was no&#xD;
fire in the drawing-room, I've asked him into the dining-room ;"&#xD;
announced the dame, who was remarkable rather for sterling&#xD;
goodness, tha~i for grace and discretion. The door of communi-&#xD;
cation was wide open, and Ida ha4 no alternative but to walk&#xD;
directly into the adjoining apartment. Charley Dana met her,&#xD;
ore she had advanced three steps beyond the doorway. He was&#xD;
so shocked at her altered appearance that he could not speak at&#xD;
once, but stood, pressing her hands in his, and gazing into, her&#xD;
face with inexpressible solicitude and tenderness. She must&#xD;
make an exertion.&#xD;
"This is kind, Charley! Am, I to flatter myself that you&#xD;
have turned out of your way to see me&#xD;
"No. I have looked neither to the right nor to the left. I&#xD;
came by the most direct route from flichmond. Sit down-you&#xD;
are not able to stand-and give an account of yourself. What&#xD;
in the name of all that is ridiculous and outrageous, brought&#xD;
you here alone, and has kept you here until the middle of the&#xD;
winter ?"&#xD;
"Not so bad as that, Charley! It is only the last month of&#xD;
Autumn. I came, because I did not want to go North, and was&#xD;
pining for a sight of the old place; and have been~~ sick ever&#xD;
since. But tell me of yourself. When did you return, and&#xD;
why have not you written to me?"&#xD;
"That is what I call 'iced!' said Charley, with a laugh that&#xD;
sounded like former times. ~' Haven't I sent letters to every&#xD;
post-office in the Union, and not received a line in answer, since&#xD;
you parted company with Arthur and Carry? I arrived at&#xD;
home, ten days ago. Mr. Read 'presumed' you i~efe 'yet in&#xD;
the country, and would be back when you were 4ady:' John&#xD;
and Jenny were in the dark; had written and inc4uired to no&#xD;
purpose: daily dispatches were pouring in from Arthur, certify-&#xD;
ing that Carry was nearly deranged with anxiety. Yesterday, I&#xD;

<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7999-00000118"/>&#xD;
284                   ALONE.&#xD;
met Mr. Read$who told me you had been 'indisposed,' but would&#xD;
be down shortly. I asked your address, and here I am I"&#xD;
"You could not be more welcome anywhere; but how unac-&#xD;
countal:de that your letters miscarried 1"&#xD;
"Easily explained! I stopped down the road, at a house,&#xD;
half-tavern, half-store, where I espied 'Post Office,' painted upon&#xD;
a shingle, hung Iut of a dirty window; and inquired the name&#xD;
of the place. 'Thompsonburg;' said the P. M. 'Burg,' indeed!&#xD;
'I thought there was an office in this neighborhood, called 'Oak-&#xD;
land;"' said I.&#xD;
"'Oh! that's discontinued more than a year ago;' answered&#xD;
he. "Twas at the Cross-roads below.'"&#xD;
Simple solution of a mystery which had led her to doubt her&#xD;
best earthly friends! Charley looked at her intently.&#xD;
Indisposition,' forsooth! Why, I'll be hanged&#xD;
"No you wont, Ch4rley! Don't say so."&#xD;
"Shot, then! if I 4m sure that I a~ not talking to a spirit!&#xD;
You've been to Death's door. What rn~de you sick ?"&#xD;
"Oh! a variety of causes*"&#xD;
"Which means, it's no business of jiiine to inquire. All I&#xD;
have to say is, that your friends would not have treated you, as&#xD;
you have them. If I had died in Missouri, I would have left&#xD;
'good-bye,' and a lock of my hair for you. You might have&#xD;
departed this life twenty times, and we been none the wiser."&#xD;
"How quarrelsome you are! I'll never do so again, if you'll&#xD;
forgive me this once."&#xD;
to "Forgive!. I have nothing to forgive-you were privileged&#xD;
do as you pleased;-only, i%~ you had said adieu to the land&#xD;
of the living, it would have been a gratification to us to know it."&#xD;
Ida laughed out so merrily that Mrs. Grant, who was super-&#xD;
intending the setting of the tea-table, raised her spectacles to&#xD;
look at her, and smiled gratifiedly. She and her husband sat at&#xD;
the~ table, and the guest's '~ sociable ways" ingratiated him with&#xD;
them, before the meal wa~ half over. They retired with the&#xD;
waiters, and Charley, dropping his bantering tone, established&#xD;
himself for a " quiet coze." It was strange that, he should be&#xD;
the first confidant of Ida's change of heart ;-he, whom men&#xD;
styled careless-sometimes "scoffer."&#xD;
He did not scoff now ;.-he paid diligent heed to her recited,&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.        285&#xD;
&#xD;
and when it was finished-" From my soul, I congratulate you !"&#xD;
he exclaimed. "Would to Heaven, that I too believed !"&#xD;
"You may ;" said Ida, timidly.&#xD;
"You do not know the thickness of the crust around my heart,&#xD;
Ida ;-the unbelief, and ingratitude and worldliness. I can ~attle&#xD;
with men, and wear a bravado mask; but I do not forget, hat I&#xD;
have a soul, and that it must be attended to. Whether II will&#xD;
ever do it, I cannot say. I think I must be the most hardened&#xD;
of sinners ;-Lynn's death would have subdued a less obdurate&#xD;
heart ;-and do you know that, while thoroughly persuade~ that&#xD;
it was a judgment aimed full at me~fo~he was my dearest&#xD;
friend, and I felt his loss, most of all mourned him-I&#xD;
hated the Power which had dealt the blow4rnd scorned angrily&#xD;
the presumption, that I could be forced intj measures&#xD;
"You were not more wicked than I was. There is not a truer&#xD;
sentence in the Bible, than that the 'carnal mind is enmity against&#xD;
God.' Ah! Charley! if we loved holy things more! It is so&#xD;
mortifying to find our thoughts straying away from these sub-&#xD;
jects, when we are most desirous of contemplating them !"&#xD;
"That is the fault of Old Adam-the 'body of death,' Paul&#xD;
writes of;" replied he. "I am not much of a BiblQ scholar, but&#xD;
it strikes me he says something in the next verse of a Deliverer,&#xD;
'who giveth us the victory.' Why are Christians ever low-spirited,&#xD;
I wonder."&#xD;
And poor Ida upbraided herself with the same query, many&#xD;
times within the next few days. She bore the partings and the&#xD;
journey better than Charley had feared she wou~d. He did his&#xD;
best to save her pain and fatigue, but he saw, w~ith secret reve-&#xD;
rence, 'that she was supported by a stronger Friei~d.&#xD;
"We are almost there !" said he, letting dow the carriage~&#xD;
window, upon the afternoon of their second day's travel.&#xD;
Ida leaned out, and beheld the spires. and roofs of the city.,&#xD;
She was unprepared for the effect the sight had upon her. Recol-&#xD;
lections of her years of loneliness; the trials of her home-life;&#xD;
the one friendship of her school days; a brother's fondness, and&#xD;
his dooms her love and its blight-rushed upon her with over-&#xD;
whelming force-she fell back upon the cushions, and wept aloud.&#xD;
She had not entirely recovered her composure, when they stopped&#xD;
atr Mr. Ret~d's door. Josephine hardly knew the wasted figure,&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7999-00000119"/>&#xD;
236        ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.        287&#xD;
&#xD;
Charley carried, rather than led into the house; and Mr. Read&#xD;
was, for once, shocked out of his dignity.&#xD;
"Why! Mr. Dana! Miss Ida I bless my soul and body I" was&#xD;
his utzch~racteristic exclamation.&#xD;
Charley was in no humour for triflipg, or e would have said,&#xD;
~C Amen I"&#xD;
"Miss Ida's indisposition was not so unim ortant as you sup-&#xD;
posed, you see, sir ;" said he sarcastically. "Thanks to the&#xD;
kind attentions of her country friends, she is now convalescent."&#xD;
"Hush, Charley! please I" sai a distressed whisper from the&#xD;
sofa, where. he had laid her. " r. Grant wrote to you, Mr.&#xD;
Read ;" said she, aloud; "but as ou were travelling, we doubted&#xD;
whether you received the letter."&#xD;
"I did not;" he answered, the ush going off from his brow.&#xD;
"I was so carefully nursed, I d d not require other attention;"&#xD;
she continued. "I should have regretted it, if your summer's&#xD;
enjoyment had been interrupted endlessly. Dr. Hall, Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Grant were t~ntiring in their kindness; and Rachel here,&#xD;
ought to have a diploma to practise medicine.~,&#xD;
It was a maxin~i with Mr. Read, that for every mischance,&#xD;
blame must rest somewhere ; and Ida, having exculpated him,&#xD;
he could not do less th~in return the compliment, by pitching it&#xD;
back upon her.&#xD;
"I do not presume to lecture you, Miss Ross; but you will&#xD;
admit that this freak of yours was one of unsurpassed impru-&#xD;
dence. You left my roof under the protection of those, whom I&#xD;
considered fit guardians for a young lady." Charley made a&#xD;
movein6nt to speak; but Ida's imploring glance restrained him.&#xD;
"I hear nothing of you for a long time; and you write, at last,&#xD;
from an uninhabited country-house, begging permission to take&#xD;
up your abode there. I refuse the preposterous request, and you&#xD;
are brought home reduced and weakened by a severe illness, of&#xD;
which I have not been informed. I cannot be responsible for&#xD;
what the world will say to all this, Miss Ross 1"&#xD;
*        The rack could not have silenced Charley now. "I will tell&#xD;
you wJiat the world's opinion is, sir; and hold you responsible&#xD;
for your own words. 'The world' has said, in my hearing, that&#xD;
the guardian, who loses sight of a ward-a member of his family&#xD;
.-.-for six months, without being apprised of, or inquiring into&#xD;
&#xD;
her locality, and welfare,~is unworthy of his trust. And if I&#xD;
describe his reception of an invalid, who might have perished&#xD;
through neglect, for all he knew or eared-' the world,' sir, will&#xD;
declare indignantly, that he is a disgrace to society and man-&#xD;
kind.! I have nothing more to say at present. If you take&#xD;
exception to my liberty of speech, you can call on me, and relieve&#xD;
your mind. Miss Ida, let me recommend to you to retire; Mr.&#xD;
Read will finish his lecture to me-good afternoon, Miss Read.&#xD;
Sir, I have the honor to bid you good-day 1"&#xD;
Josephine burst forth with a torrent of invective: which Ida&#xD;
did not stay to hear; nor did she see either of them agai~k for&#xD;
two days. She was not well enough to go below; an~they&#xD;
avoided her chamber.&#xD;
Mrs. Dana called that evening. Ida was preparing for bed;&#xD;
and she supplanted Rachel as maid and nurse. Her softest,&#xD;
most nimble of hands undressed the tired, dispirited girl;&#xD;
smoothed the pillows; and gave her a composing draught; and&#xD;
with her kiss warm upon her lips, her pitying eyes watching&#xD;
over her, and a prayer of thankfulness at her heart, Ida fell&#xD;
asleep.&#xD;
She learned to expect a daily visit from this dear friend; and&#xD;
rarely looked in vain. At her third coming she brought a note&#xD;
from Charley. "He was happy to state;" he said; "that The&#xD;
skirmish which had excited her uneasiness, had arrived at a&#xD;
bloodless issue. Mr. Read and himself had had an interview;&#xD;
he had apologized for using language to him, in his own house,&#xD;
which he considered himself justifiable in employing anywhere&#xD;
else; and Mr. Read excused his harshness to her, by represent-&#xD;
ing the excitement of surprise and alarm, under which he was&#xD;
laboring at the time. It was agreed the matter should stop&#xD;
there-that is ;" wrote Charley; "that his bugbear, the world,&#xD;
shall not get hold of it."&#xD;
Josephine had received her orders; for she carried her work&#xD;
into Ida's chamber, that day, and sat one* hour, to a minute,&#xD;
never opening her lips, save in monosyllables to the questions&#xD;
Ida forced herself to ask. Abandoning seclusion so soon as she&#xD;
had sufficient strength, the latter joined the family at meals, and&#xD;
remained longer in their society than she was wont to do for-&#xD;
merly; and if her hope of eventually conquering the~.r dislike&#xD;

&#xD;
did not increase, her meekness and patience did. She had occa-&#xD;
sion\ for it all. Josephine was quick to discover that she was&#xD;
happier in her affliction and debility, than she was in health and&#xD;
prosperity; and when the truth came to light, her natural&#xD;
malignity to the cause, an er hatred of its humble professor&#xD;
triumphed in the fiendish an citation of how she could, by&#xD;
deriding one, wound the other. She would have described soil&#xD;
upon an angel's robe. Ida was a~ young Christian, contending&#xD;
with the manifold disadvantages of temper, habit and irreligious&#xD;
associates; and her wily assailant was not passive long or lack&#xD;
of weapons and opportunity for her warfare. Any symptoms ot&#xD;
a convalescent's irritability; the utterance of a taste or opinion,&#xD;
which did .not tally with her standard oC consistency, was ~n arked&#xD;
and laid by for use; and no complaisance or concession oh Ida's&#xD;
* part, moved her purpose. Mr. Read paid his pew-rent, went to&#xD;
church once every fine Sunday, and had a pleasant impression&#xD;
that by so doing, he was "keeping along ;" paying interest as&#xD;
it were, upon the debt, sanguine that when the distant pay-day&#xD;
arrived, he would be able, by one prodigio~is effort, to discharge&#xD;
the principal. He "hated cant, because it was silly and use-&#xD;
less ;" and if he did not chime in his daughter's slurs upon reli-&#xD;
gion, and the conduct of Christians, he never rebuked her by&#xD;
word or sign. Watchfully, prayerfully, Ida strove to keep her&#xD;
feet in the path, and by no misstep or fall, to cast obloquy upon&#xD;
the name she loved.&#xD;
Anna Talbot, a friendly, good-natured girl-.her brother'a&#xD;
superior in sense and feeling, was a near neighbor; and she ran&#xD;
in directly after breakfast one morning, full of a ball to which&#xD;
she was invited. Josephine had a ticket also, and was wishing&#xD;
for her-she must consult her about her dress.&#xD;
"Ma has bought me a lovely, white silk," said Anna. "I&#xD;
am to wear sprigged illusion over it.--but oh! I was so disap-&#xD;
pointed! I wanted silv~-sprigged, you know, like that Miss&#xD;
What's-her-name, from Philadelphia, wore to Mrs. Porter's&#xD;
party-but although I ransacked every store in the city, I could&#xD;
not find a piece. ~What will you get, Josey ?"&#xD;
"I have not quite determined."&#xD;
"Do let us dress alike! There is another pattern of silk at&#xD;
P        S&#xD;
&#xD;
*" Well! I will look at it. What head-dress ?" inquired&#xD;
Josephine.&#xD;
"Oh! that's another novelty! I saw two darling little loves&#xD;
of wreathes down town-rose-buds and lilies-of-the-valley-pure&#xD;
white. I asked Mrs. Y-.-- to lay them aside until to-day. I&#xD;
thought of you.&#xD;
The "darling litth3 loves" were pronounced aufait.&#xD;
"What ornaments?" said Josephine, who was in her element.&#xD;
Anna made a gesture of despair. " There's the trouble! I&#xD;
have nothing but those rubies, and the y will not do at all. I&#xD;
dislike to go without any; but it cannot be helped."&#xD;
"Pearls would correspond well with your dress," observed&#xD;
Ida.&#xD;
"Ah, yes! my dear! and if I had a pearl fishery, I would&#xD;
draw upon my divers forthwith ;-unfortunately I have not'."&#xD;
"Are you certain ?" returned Ida, smiling. Imagine me a&#xD;
diver. I have a neat set, which is at your service, if you will&#xD;
honor me by wearing it."&#xD;
"Oh! you dearest of girls 1" exclaimed Anna. "But you&#xD;
want them yourself-I beg your pardon-I forgot you were in&#xD;
mourning ;-but your black is not too deep for ornaments."&#xD;
"B~it her odor of sanctity is too strong," said Josephine.&#xD;
"She has renounced the pom s and vanities you and I love,&#xD;
Anna, and 'put on the.&#xD;
do you reconcile it ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.'&#xD;
flow                 with your conscience, to let your pearls&#xD;
attend a ball, Ida? How much scouring and praying will cleanse&#xD;
them again for your use&#xD;
"Oh! I will get you or Anna to air them for me, once in a&#xD;
while, and trust to time to purify them," said Ida, willing to&#xD;
pass it off as a joke.&#xD;
"Do you really think it sinful to go to balls ?" asked Anna,&#xD;
wonderingly.&#xD;
"I could not do it innocently," replied Ida.&#xD;
~ Why not? you used to like them as well as the rest of us."&#xD;
"For pity's sake! no* sernionising !" rudely interrupted Jose-&#xD;
phine. "I can show you the root of her piety in two words.&#xD;
Don't you remember a certain gentleman, whose handsome face&#xD;
and saintly smile set off his religion so well ?"&#xD;
"Oh !" laughed Anna; "but I thought he liked her very*&#xD;
well as she was!'&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7999-00000121"/>&#xD;
240           ALONE.                                     ALONE.           .241&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nothing like making assurance doubly sure 1" answered ~the&#xD;
other. "Pity he did not return to town this winter. Love's&#xD;
lahor is lost."&#xD;
"Why, Ida! what a flirt you are I" cried Anna. "When&#xD;
everybody says you are engaged to Mr. Dana I"&#xD;
"Everybody is wrong, then," said Ida, calmly.&#xD;
"Everybody is right !" contradicted Josephine. "She reads&#xD;
in her Biblethat she 'must love all men;' and her being in&#xD;
mourning for one beau, and dying with love for another, are no&#xD;
impediments to her engagement with a third. This is Plan-&#xD;
tonism with a vengeance.&#xD;
"Fie! Josephine 1" said Anna, perceiving by Ida's face, that&#xD;
the pleasantry, as she still thought it, was going too far. "You&#xD;
know, as well as I do, that Mr. Holmes was only a friend. Mrs.&#xD;
Dana is in black for him too-it is as reasonable to say that she&#xD;
was in love with him."&#xD;
"She may have been, for anything I know to the contrary;"&#xD;
retorted Josephine, growing more and more insolent. "I don't&#xD;
pretend to understand the morals of 'the clique."'&#xD;
"I am going up stairs, Anna," said Ida, "and will send you&#xD;
the pearls. If they please you, you are welcome to them, when-&#xD;
ever you wish them."&#xD;
Anna pulled her down. "Don't go! I want to talk with you.&#xD;
You~must not regard Josephine's nonsense-it is only a foolish&#xD;
jest."&#xD;
"One, which must not be repeated 1" said Ida. "I may not&#xD;
notice an insult to myself, but if my friends are slandered, I&#xD;
trust defend them."&#xD;
"Defend them, as long and loud as you choose ;" replied&#xD;
Josephine, retaining her disagreeable smile and tone. "Recriuii-&#xD;
nate too, if you like. It is but politic in you to fight for your&#xD;
patrons. Aha! that flash of the eye was Christian-like! Did&#xD;
you never observe, Anna, that when the 'brethren' are wrought&#xD;
up to the belligerent point, they are the fiercest of combatants ?"&#xD;
Ida hurried .up stairs-threw hei~self upon the bed, and cried&#xD;
bitterly; unobservant of Rachel's presence.&#xD;
"Oh! Father! pity me! I am so weak and wicked!" she&#xD;
prayed&#xD;
Rachel went out boiling with rage.&#xD;
&#xD;
"More of that Evil's work! Hope I may be forgiven for&#xD;
saying sech a word, but if she didn't come from the bottomless&#xD;
ditch, I should jist like to be reformed whar she was made! I&#xD;
know mighty well whar she'll go. I ain't a goin" to stand it!&#xD;
Miss Ida shan't be terrified forever and ever. I'll speak my&#xD;
mind to Miss Jenny, before I'm a day older; maybe Mars' John&#xD;
can get her away from this dreadful place. Miss Ida'd never&#xD;
forgive me; but she needn't know nothing' about my tellin' 1"&#xD;
"Miss Jenny" heard her with indignant astonishment; but&#xD;
giving her no encouragement to proceed with her tale, or to hope&#xD;
for an amelioration of her mistress' condition, merely said she&#xD;
was sorry she could do nothing for her; and advised her to&#xD;
imitate Ida's prudence and silence; c~e~psel ~vhich confirmed&#xD;
Rachel's skepticism in "white folks' friendship." Ida thought&#xD;
Charley kinder than ever, that evening. If he had known the&#xD;
severity of her day's discipline, he could not have been more&#xD;
tender and consolatory. His inattention to Josephine, who also&#xD;
had visitors, troubled her somewhat; but she had the comforting&#xD;
reflection that she was not to blame for it. The day of the ball,&#xD;
he took her and Mrs. Dana to ride. They called at the residence&#xD;
of a country friend, to whose green-house Charley had the entree;&#xD;
and he improved his privilege by culling a houcjuet of Camelias,&#xD;
tea-roses and orange blossoms %' for the belle of the ball ;" he told&#xD;
his hostess. When they were again in the carriage, he handed&#xD;
them to Ida, with ~a laugh. "I have no idea of going to the&#xD;
ball, and you would be the belle, if you were to attend; so there&#xD;
was no fibbing, wa~ there ?" The flowers were beautiful, and at&#xD;
this season, very rare; and Ida bore them home carefully, and&#xD;
put them in water in her room. They were sweet company; she&#xD;
could only watch, and pet, and talk to them the rest of the day.&#xD;
Mr. Read was uncommonly jocose at supper time.&#xD;
"Make yourself pretty, Josey," said he, lighting his lamp;&#xD;
"you don't have me to escort you every evening."&#xD;
Josephine looked after him with a sneer. "A mighty honor!&#xD;
If he had a spark of generosity or politeness, he would have&#xD;
bought me a bouquet, if they do ask such enormous prices. I&#xD;
have a good mind not to go, I shall feel so mean without one."&#xD;
Ida said she regretted it; and she did feel for her. She knew,&#xD;
that to party-goers, these little things are no trifles; she bad&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7999-00000122"/>&#xD;
242                   ALONE.,&#xD;
seen a girl dull or sulky for an entire evening, because of a&#xD;
deficiency of this sort.&#xD;
"I wish I could help her," she was saying to herself, as she&#xD;
returned toher apartment. The aroma that stole upon her senses&#xD;
said, "you can." She was no heroine, or she stood over her&#xD;
~I1owers, and doubted and pondered for a good half hour, before&#xD;
her wavering mind rested upon its pivot; and then a tear bedewed&#xD;
a Camelia's spotless bosom, as she emptied the vase, and saying&#xD;
Iloud, "If thine enemy thirst, give him drink," set about arrang-&#xD;
ing them anew. Her Christmas rose-tree was hanging with buds,&#xD;
which, on the morrow, would be blossoms, but she despoiled it of&#xD;
its nodding pearls; and adding geraniums and citronaloes, com-&#xD;
pleted as~tasteful a bouquet, as ever bloomed under the fingers&#xD;
of a fashionable florist.&#xD;
She gave it to Josephine, when she came into the parlor to&#xD;
survey her full-length figure in the tall glass.&#xD;
"Oh! how lovely I" she exclaimed involuntarily; then&#xD;
recovering herself, said coldly, "They are pretty;" and returned&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"They are for you," said Ida.&#xD;
"Who sent them ?"&#xD;
"They were presented to me; and as their beauty is wasted&#xD;
upon the 'desert air' of my chamber, I shall be obliged to you&#xD;
to display them."&#xD;
Josephine would have rejected the generous offer; if there had&#xD;
been the remotest chance of another; but it was late, and she&#xD;
could not go b 9uquetless.&#xD;
"Who gave~ them to you ?" she asked.&#xD;
Ida paused, then replied, "Mr. Dana."&#xD;
"He will know them; I had rather go without any."&#xD;
"No danger of that! he will not be there." Her patience&#xD;
was nearly spent.. Josephine accepted the gift with a very bad&#xD;
grace; she was awkward and embarrassed, and what appears&#xD;
more improbable, a little ashamed. Mr. Read was attired with&#xD;
scrupulous neatness aiA elegance, and looked ten years younger&#xD;
than ho really was. Ida "presumed" to tell him so, aiad was&#xD;
recompensed by a bland smile. She had done her duty; per-&#xD;
haps more, and she did not repent of her selfAenial; but some-&#xD;
thing of the desolate feeling of "lang-syne" fell upon her, as&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.         243&#xD;
&#xD;
she was left, sole tenant of the parlor and the house. Weak&#xD;
and weary, she sighed for human society and affection. It was&#xD;
a darkened hour; clouded by self-doubting; mournful memories&#xD;
and forebodings. The piano was open; she had not touched it.&#xD;
since her arrival at home; but she went to it now; only plaintive&#xD;
tunes came to her fingers; she played fitfully, as her mood dis-&#xD;
posed her; the music was the voice of her thoughts; and she&#xD;
sang to a rambling, irregular measure-&#xD;
"I am alone-the last light tread&#xD;
And laugh h~ve died upon my ear;&#xD;
And I may weep unche6ked-nor dread&#xD;
The scorn, that forces back the tear.&#xD;
I turn to Thee! oh! when the strings,&#xD;
The trustful heart has fondly thrown,&#xD;
Woun4 closely round its best-loved things.-..&#xD;
Are, by one stroke, asunder torn,&#xD;
And bleeding, crushed, uncared for, lie-.&#xD;
When Hope's gay smile no joy can throw,&#xD;
And the soul breathes but one wish-~-to die!&#xD;
To whom else can the suffering go?&#xD;
Thou-Thou dost look within, and read&#xD;
How I have sought for love, and found&#xD;
Reproach instead-how in its need&#xD;
My spirit bowed it to the ground,-&#xD;
E'en to the duift-and deemed it nought&#xD;
Bore patiently, when pained and wronged&#xD;
And smiled on sorrow, if it brought&#xD;
The priceless boon for which it longes~L&#xD;
In vain! in vain! and now I come-&#xD;
As to her nest the dove doth flee;&#xD;
Give Thou my wandering heart a home-&#xD;
And bind its shattered chords to Thee !"&#xD;
"My poor child! are you then so sad ?"&#xD;
She knew the hand upon her drooping head before he spoke;&#xD;
and with a prayer for support, that calmed her fluttering heart,&#xD;
arose to greet him.&#xD;
"Am I forgiven for my intrusion ?" said he, leading her to a&#xD;
chair. "The front door was ajar, and hearing your music, I&#xD;
entered without ringing."&#xD;
"Freely pardoned! Have you been in town long 7"&#xD;
"Since five o'clock this afternoon. I am on my way to the&#xD;
south with Annie. She is ordered to winter in Florida. Co&#xD;
with us-will you not? Charley supped with us; and Annie&#xD;
proposed this plan on hearing of yout feeble health. She will&#xD;
wait until you are ready if you comply."&#xD;

"lam very grateful for her kindness; but I cannot avail&#xD;
myself of it."&#xD;
"Are there any 'propriety scruples ?"' inquired he, smiling.&#xD;
"Yoti will be her companion; and the most fastidious cannot&#xD;
object to the escort of a brother, and-an engaged man."&#xD;
She was fortified against even this. Her arch glance hid the&#xD;
h4art-pang faithfully. "Where is she 7" she questioned.&#xD;
"Lelia? at her father's house in S.-.---. Here is her coun-&#xD;
terfeit." He unclasped a locket.&#xD;
"It is like Oarry !" said Ida; then ~he scanned it long and&#xD;
earnestly. She was very beautiful; with large, blue eyes; and&#xD;
a cherry mouth, just parted in a smile; and shining hair, folded&#xD;
above the smooth forehead-fair enough for him! and as she&#xD;
raised her eyes to say how lovely she was, she beheld herself in&#xD;
the glass opposite-wan, hollow-eyed and sallow-and felt how&#xD;
presumptuous-how reckless in its folly, her dream had been!&#xD;
He shut the spring, without looking at it himself, (it was delicate&#xD;
and considerate to avoid the comparison!) and making, no reply&#xD;
to her praises of his betrothed; began to speak of the bond of&#xD;
fellowship, formed between themselves, since their parting. She&#xD;
had been discouraged by her inability'to talk of what was ever&#xD;
in her mind; had distrusted the genuineness of her faith, because,&#xD;
her tongue faltered in telling of the love which had redeemed&#xD;
her. He entered fully into her feelings; and she, surprised her~&#xD;
self by the freedom the consciousness of this afforded her. He told&#xD;
her of his difficulties and temptations and conflicts, often antici-&#xD;
pating what she would have related of her own experience. So&#xD;
well did his counsels and comfort meet the inquiries and wants&#xD;
-of her spirit, that she debated within herself whether be were&#xD;
not sent by heaven-a special messenger in her hour of trial.&#xD;
"Say on !" said he, encouragingly, as he caught her eye.&#xD;
"I was about to ask if you believed in what are termed&#xD;
minute or particular Providences."&#xD;
"As in my existence! even to the numbering of the hairs of&#xD;
any head. You have not been troubling your brain with quib-&#xD;
bling~ upon this subject, I hope ?"&#xD;
"No; but I have heard it disputed by very good people, who&#xD;
confuse me by their 'free agency,' and 'accountability,' and&#xD;
'decrees.'"&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.         245&#xD;
&#xD;
"Discard theories, and eschew arguments. Let your Bible&#xD;
and your common sense be your teachers. As a machinist&#xD;
fashion~ the minutest cog of the smallest wheel, as carefully as&#xD;
the mighty lever, the main power,-so the Supreme Governor&#xD;
looks to the balance of the tiniest atom in His universe."&#xD;
"Then," said Ida; "I do not commit presumption when I&#xD;
trace my Father's hand in every-day events; when I lift up my&#xD;
soul in thankfulness for a pleasant, or ennobling thought,' a&#xD;
visit, a gift, an act of friendship, which has ma~1e me better or&#xD;
happier-or say 'Thy\ will be done?' in the petty trials, which&#xD;
annoy, rather than a~jet us I"&#xD;
." It is your privilege and duty. The introductory sentence&#xD;
of the Lord's Prayer is sufficient to inculcate this truth. 'Our&#xD;
Father-' is not a father's care constant? He says moreover-&#xD;
'we must become as little children.' Who relies more than a&#xD;
child? 'As thy day is; so shall thy strength be ;.-' no matter&#xD;
where, or how we are placed, God will give us the requisite&#xD;
strength; and as our positions are changing every moment, does&#xD;
not this say that He will be with us every moment, and order&#xD;
the success of whatever we attempt, by the amount of strength&#xD;
He imparts? And again, 'not a sparrow falls to the ground&#xD;
without your Father.' Nothing which God does is small and&#xD;
He 'orders all things according to the counsel of His own will.'&#xD;
Then nothing is insignificant, because God orders everything.&#xD;
Our actions may appear trivial; but do they not assun~e a ter-&#xD;
rible importance, when we learn that even' our fleeting words are&#xD;
to be the data of our judgment, at the last day? A few good&#xD;
people doubt the doctrine of 'special Providenoes;' but is it not&#xD;
better for us to believe what God says of his character than to&#xD;
determine what character he ought to have? If He says He is&#xD;
the God of 'the hairs of our heads-' of 'sparrows' and lilies&#xD;
of the field-all We have to do, is to take His word for truth,&#xD;
and net accordingly. His attention to small things is as con-&#xD;
clusive a proof of His Divinity, as to great ones. It has been&#xD;
well said, that 'man cannot. comprehend the Infinitely great,&#xD;
nor the Infinitely sp~all.' But I weary you."&#xD;
"You do not-I am interested and instructed. I am but a&#xD;
babe in leading.strings; so weak and ignorant, it terrifies me to&#xD;

think of the possibility that I will be obliged to take a single&#xD;
step without holding my Father's hand."&#xD;
"That is what none of us are called upon to do, Ida. 'I will&#xD;
never leave thee, nor forsake thee~' 'Even there shall thy hand&#xD;
lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.' We could not&#xD;
stand alone an instant, were this 'right hand' withdrawn."&#xD;
"Charley, who strews many pearls among the rubbish he&#xD;
scatters abroad, once set me to thinking seriously-I hope,&#xD;
not unprofitable, by wondering why Christians were ever low-&#xD;
spirited," said Ida. "It seems to me that they would not be,&#xD;
)f their confidence in God were implicit and abiding; but I am&#xD;
often sad-almost responding."&#xD;
"To-night, for instance," said Mr. Lacy, cheerfully. "'This&#xD;
kind goeth not out, but by prayer;' and you must not be cast&#xD;
down, thiit you cannot, in a month, overcome a habit of yeai~s.&#xD;
Humanly speaking, you have had much to embitter your lot ;-&#xD;
but as we can, in reviewing our past lives, see many events&#xD;
which, *Janus-like, approached us frowningly, now changed to&#xD;
smiles of. blessing, ought we not, with this attestation of expe-&#xD;
rience to the truth of His promises, to trust Him in the dark*&#xD;
ways we now tread ?"&#xD;
"Poor Lynn 1" her full eyes overflowed. "How frequently&#xD;
I am reminded of his-&#xD;
am blind! in rough paths groping&#xD;
With outstretehed hands and sightless eyes!"'&#xD;
"Let us hope that the Everlasting arms *received him," said&#xD;
Mr. Lacy. ~i I feared to speak of him to you, Ida; knowing,&#xD;
as I do, that upon a heart like yours, such a blow must have&#xD;
left indelible traces. You have not-you never will forget him,&#xD;
but can you not believe that this, too, was intended for your&#xD;
good ?"&#xD;
"I do4-.although at the time, it seemed very hard that from&#xD;
my meagre listof friends, one so necessary to my happiness,&#xD;
should be stricken. I may never meet another, who will give&#xD;
me affecdon so fond, yet so disinterdsted."&#xD;
"iDisit~terested! that ~s a term not generally applied to love&#xD;
which let~s to betrothal."&#xD;
"Mr. E~acy !" ejaouh~ted Ida, astonished. "But no! you&#xD;
~kuow U7tOo well? did lynn never tell you.-" she stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, I first heard of your engagement from a third person;&#xD;
you confirmed it, subsequently."&#xD;
"What da you mean? yo~ are under a strange misapprehen-&#xD;
sion. I never was betrothed to Lynn;* he never thought of me&#xD;
but~ as a friend."&#xD;
"Ida I" his tone was stern. "What are you saying? Have&#xD;
you forgotten the night you left my side for his, uyon seeing his&#xD;
dejection-the long promenade, and hjs reproaches for what he&#xD;
deemed-.wrongfully, as . I am now assured~-was coquetry in&#xD;
you? I was told then, what I had heard, without heeding&#xD;
before, that you were plighted lovers. So. confirmed was I, in&#xD;
my disbelief that I would have declared it, in defiance of the proofs&#xD;
presented to me, had I not overheard by accident a portiQn of&#xD;
your conversation. He said-(I remember it well I)-' I have&#xD;
loved you as man never loved woman before-have believed you&#xD;
pure and high-minded.. IC I thought that thede~pioable coquetry&#xD;
you hint at, had caused you ,to insist upon the concealment of&#xD;
our engagement-' I lost the rest. Is not this enough? must I&#xD;
harrow your feelings by recurring to your appeal to me to save&#xD;
him from crime and death for your sake ;-or to the awful hour&#xD;
when you were summoned to receive his last' sigh? Oh! Ida!&#xD;
Ida! I have trusted in your truth-klo not shake my faith now!"&#xD;
There was bewilderment, but not falsehood in the eyes that&#xD;
sustained his rebuking glance. "I have spokenthe truth. The&#xD;
sentence which misled you, was the repetition of a remark made&#xD;
to another ;-the whisper in his dying hour, a message t~ the&#xD;
same. To me-I repeat-he was a brother, devoted and tr~e&#xD;
to the last-but nothing more."&#xD;
His lips were ashy white;-~his self-command 'had utterly&#xD;
deserted him.&#xD;
"I have been terrib1~y deceived!" he said, rising and racing&#xD;
the floor. 'C Ida I" he resumed, coming back to her side. "We&#xD;
have spoken Qf the 'mysterious dealings of Providence \I did&#xD;
not think my trust would be tested so soon. You have 4nwit-&#xD;

but if I were the husband, instead of the betrothed of another,&#xD;
I should feel bound to clear my honor from the aspersion my&#xD;

conduct has cast upon it. My actions-my language, must&#xD;
have convinced you that I loved you ;-you were ignorant of the&#xD;
mistake into which I had fallen-what interpretation have you&#xD;
put upon my course, since,? You did not misconstrue my atten-.&#xD;
tion then-tell me-am I aknave-a hypocrite in your sight ?"&#xD;
"Never I". said she, lifting a face, as pale as his own. " My&#xD;
confidence in your friendship and integrity has not swerved, and&#xD;
there lives not one who will pray for your happiness- with more&#xD;
sincerity; who is more thankful for your noble renunciation of&#xD;
personal feeling to advance her welfare. We are friends! we&#xD;
will forget everything but this."&#xD;
She was standing before him; and while speaking, laid her&#xD;
hand in his. He gazed silently into the countenance, so elevated&#xD;
in its look of heroic seif-devoticon.&#xD;
" You llave chosen one far more worthy of you than I could&#xD;
ever have been ;-you will be very haypy together. I hope to&#xD;
meet her some day, and love her, as all must love the beautiful&#xD;
and good. There is a consolation those friends have at parting,&#xD;
iwhose home is not here ;--.-that, although we walk in different&#xD;
pathways on earth, they all lead to our abiding-place-Heaven."&#xD;
With an uncontrollable impulse, he drew her to him, and pres d&#xD;
his lips to her brow I He was gone ! and the poor human he rt&#xD;
bled from the slow torture to which it had been put. He htd&#xD;
not dreamed of it,-..had not suspected, when her steady, sw et&#xD;
-tones told him of their separate pathways, that her soul as&#xD;
reaching, in intense yearnings, towards the lightsome w ,&#xD;
where flowers, sprang beneath -his steps, and shuddering at ti e&#xD;
tomb-like chill of that which echoed her lonely foot-fall. e&#xD;
was gone! and the weeping eyes which sought Heaven, show d&#xD;
from whence she had derived the supernatural strength whidh&#xD;
had borne her through the trying interview ;-and with the cry&#xD;
of unspeakable sorrow that succeeded his departure, arose a peti- -&#xD;
tion for larger supplies. It was granted. She wept still; but&#xD;
not in wretchedness. Solemn, pure resolutions were growing&#xD;
up beneath the waves of grief. The destruction of this hope--&#xD;
the dearest in a woman's heart, was the fall of a proud plaut,-&#xD;
the garden's pi-ide--in its matured beauty. Buds and blooms&#xD;
wilt. and perish upon the stalk, but from the .laden seed-vessels&#xD;
are showered far and wide gerins that shall rejoice many hearts&#xD;
with the sweetness and loveliness' their parent garnered for one.&#xD;

-IT was so cold and damp in the morning, that Rachel, in virtue&#xD;
of her nursely prerogatives, forbade her mistress' rising before&#xD;
breakfast.. Ida was not averse to keeping her room. She&#xD;
wished to achieve another victory over herself before meeting&#xD;
Josephine. A suspicion of her agency in Mr. Lacy's deception&#xD;
-ripened, upon reflection, into a certainty, her love of justice&#xD;
prompted her to banish. .But a hundred incidents'occurred to&#xD;
her memory Especi 11y, she recollected that Josephine had&#xD;
accosted him, directly after she had taken Lynn's arm in the&#xD;
Fair-room, that she was still with him at the close of the even-&#xD;
ing, and that he had looked sorrowfully-reproachfully at her.&#xD;
She had no just conception of the girl's total destitution of prin-&#xD;
ciple, nor of her envy of herself; but she knew her to be weak;&#xD;
vain and spiteful; and against her will, she had to credit a con-&#xD;
clusion, she judged uncharitable. She did not desire to ascer-&#xD;
tain its truth; it could make no difference at this late -date.&#xD;
Another perplexity assailed her ;-should she tell Josephine of&#xD;
the visit she had had ? Should she hear of it from some other&#xD;
source, or by a'direct inquiry of herself, whether 'she had spent&#xD;
The evening alone-whic conjectures might not be formed as to&#xD;
the motive of her silence? She was deliberating thus, when the&#xD;
door flew back, and Josephine walked in. Ida, nervously excit-&#xD;
able, started from her pillow, and clasped her hands in speech-&#xD;
loss alarm at the suddenness and disorder 'of her appearance.&#xD;
She, was frightfully pallid, and her eyes were inflamed with&#xD;
weeping and rage.&#xD;
Locking the door, she advanced to the foot of the bed, and&#xD;
grasped the post tightly, as if to brace herself for some desperate&#xD;
'act. Ida could not stir, and the two regarded each other for a&#xD;
moment without a word, Josephine was'-torn by some fearful&#xD;
conflict : Ida had never seen her eyes dimmed by a tear ; and&#xD;
when the struggle for language ended in a tempestuous burst of&#xD;
weeping, the thought flashed over her, that she was~ bereft of&#xD;
.reason.&#xD;

"Josephine! what has happened ?" she could scarcely utter.&#xD;
J~sephine dashed off the thick-coming drops.&#xD;
"Happened! yes! it will not matter to you, who can leave&#xD;
this abominable place in two years-or to-morrow, if you choose&#xD;

"He is! and I will say it! 'Josey '-said he, simpering and&#xD;

"Because I liked it-I suppose, sir."&#xD;
"'No, my dear ;-I had my reasons for wishing you to loo)&#xD;

"Who is it, sir? may I ask ?" said I.&#xD;
"He giggled' and winked-oh! so disgustingly! 'Did you&#xD;
imagine that I was idle all the time I wa~ in the country? You&#xD;
were flirting at the Springs, and I concluded to try my hand.&#xD;
You 'have too much care upon you, for so young a person; what&#xD;
do you say to my engaging a 'help?'&#xD;
"A housekeeper would be a convenience ;" answered I.&#xD;
"" A. ball is a proper 'place to hunt up housekeepers!' said he,&#xD;
l~1azing out. 'No airs, miss! you understand me! I am to be&#xD;
married in a fortnight, and you may as well take it quietly-.&#xD;
o~ it will be worse for you'&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is too late for him to brow-beat me, and so I said; and&#xD;
that I would worry his atd her life out, as surely as she crossed&#xD;
this threshold-that he had 'made~ 'himself the laughing-stock&#xD;
of the city-he had been taken in by a designing creature who&#xD;
wanted his money-for he had lost his good looks and his&#xD;
senses too, it appeared.-"&#xD;
"' It you say another word,' said he, griping my arm-there!&#xD;
you see the bruise! 'I will put you out of the carriage, and&#xD;
you may die before I will give you a cent 'to save you from star-&#xD;
vation. You will see this lady to-night, and if you do not treat&#xD;
her with becoming politeness, you don't go home with me, nor&#xD;
after me, either ~'&#xD;
"You never saw such a tiger! When we were there,~ I&#xD;
scowled at every dried-up old maid, who looked as if she were&#xD;
husband-hunting. I had picked out one, with a ~skinny neck&#xD;
and corkscrew curls, whei~ up steps our youthful lover, with a&#xD;
lady hanging on his arm ;-he, all honey and smiles-she, cool&#xD;
and bold. 'Miss Copeland-let me make you acquainted with&#xD;
my daughter!' I wanted to strike' her in the face, but~his eye was&#xD;
too threatening ;-so I choked myself with a pretty speech, and&#xD;
she bowed condescendingly. I gave her one look, though, when&#xD;
he did not see-and she glared 'back at me. I'll warrantL there'll&#xD;
be no love lost !"&#xD;
"But 'what is she like? She may be an agreeable co&#xD;
pinion," said Ida.'&#xD;
"Ida Ross! I didn't come to you for chanting consolation! I&#xD;
was too full to keep my fury to myself-and I hate her rather more&#xD;
than I do you. This is why I have told you about the wretch.&#xD;
'Companion!' I'll be company for her! She had better be&#xD;
burned alive, than come here. She will wish she had been, or&#xD;
my name is not Read 1"&#xD;
"But you' can escape by marriage ;" suggested Ida, who per-&#xD;
ceived that the girl was suffering, and pitied her, while she trem-&#xD;
bled at ber frenzy.&#xD;
"Say that again, and I will murder you I" retorted Josephine,&#xD;
in the white heat of concentrated passion. "You will make me&#xD;
remember that our old scores are not quite settled yet."&#xD;
"I have no scores- against you ;" said Ida, firmly. "The&#xD;

Josephine regarded her fixedly. "You are wise ~" she said,&#xD;
presently, breaking into a contemptuous laugh. "To another,&#xD;
you would 'preach repentance-you know I never repent 1" and&#xD;
pith this strange speech, she quitted her.&#xD;
Now that he~ had broken the matter to his daughter, the bride-&#xD;
groom used the utmost celerity in the dispatch of preliminaries.&#xD;
The house was filled with workmen, upholsterers and cooks,&#xD;
whose din destroyed the quiet of Ida's chamber, the only one left&#xD;
unaltered. Josephine adhered to her resolution not to move a&#xD;
finger in the preparations for the detested intruder's reception.&#xD;
She would not go to the marriage, which took place ~t the bride's&#xD;
either's, in the country. Mr. Read did not insist; he was&#xD;
secretly pleased to be free for this evening-consCious that he&#xD;
could acquit himself more creditably, if her eyes were not upon&#xD;
him. The wedding party was to be at his house, the next night&#xD;
but one. The supper was in the hands Qf the profession; Mr..&#xD;
Read 'being too~\ prudent to risk the probability of a grievous&#xD;
mordfication, by~ entrusting the most trifling arrangement to his&#xD;
filial mar-plot.&#xD;
It w~s dark when the bridal party arrived. The girls were&#xD;
dres~ed,~ ~and in the drawing-room. Ida's picture of the bride,&#xD;
drawn from Josephine's representment, was of an overdressed,&#xD;
ward country girl, who had wheedled and flattered a man of&#xD;
ble her age, into an offer of his hand and fortune ; and she&#xD;
was puzzled by the elaborate toilette of the step-daughter. If her&#xD;
aim was to out~hiue the creature she ha~1 described~ she had cer-&#xD;
tainly over-esti4~ated the labor its accomplishment\ required. She&#xD;
swept into the apartment with a hauteur, that made her minu-&#xD;
tive form appear two inches taller; her jetty hair, almost an&#xD;
incumbrance fi~om its length and profusion, dressed partly in&#xD;
ringlets, partly in braids-instead of, as she usually wore it at&#xD;
parties, and as her father liked' to see it-in natural curls float-&#xD;
ing upon her shoulders. This style gave her a juvenile air,&#xD;
pleasing, heretofore-discarded by the full-fledged woman she&#xD;
acted to-night. Her robe was of white satin; the falling shoul-&#xD;
ders and proud swell of the throat exhibited to fine advantage&#xD;
by the low bodice. Ida was dressed in a ~ilver-grey silk, with a&#xD;
berth of rich black lace; the throat-latch and cuffs of black&#xD;
velvet and jet, makitfg her extreme paleness more striking. Her&#xD;

figure and expression of repose had its opposite in the impersona-&#xD;

rustling and gleaming in the blaze of the chandeliers.&#xD;
~' They havjcome I" said Ida, with a pitying accent, she could&#xD;
not repress, as Josphine turned deadly pale at the sound of&#xD;
wheels. "We must meet them," and she took her baud. Hers&#xD;
was fiercely thrown off. Repeilant, defiant, she disdained sup~&#xD;
port. The bride's brother and bridesmaids had accompanied&#xD;
her; bat Ida scarcely remarked their muffled-up figures, as&#xD;
"Miss Murray-" "Miss Arnold"-were named. Her eyes&#xD;
and thoughts were for the new Mrs. Read. Josephine's aver-&#xD;
sion had hood-winked her. Ida subscribed to her "cool and&#xD;
bold," as the solitary clause of the description that had the&#xD;
slightest' resemblance to the reality; and "bold" was too coarse&#xD;
an epithet for the polished indifference of a woman of the world.&#xD;
She was not more than three-and-twenty, handsome, even in her&#xD;
travelling apparel-not "baby-faced" and went through the&#xD;
introductions with a nonchalant gr ~ ~; ' touching Josephine's&#xD;
cheek with her lips; extending to Ida, the tips of her fingers,.-.&#xD;
and bestowing a fashionable nod upon the group of servants in&#xD;
the hall; then, escorted by her husband, led the way, up-stairs.&#xD;
Josephine's face was balefully dark, as she resumed her k.&#xD;
It was a part of her retribution, although she would not see -&#xD;
that as she had slighted, and thrust aside others, whose lits&#xD;
were equal with hers,-.she was to take a secondary place where&#xD;
she had ruled so long.&#xD;
The company were assembled, before the happy pair made&#xD;
their entry. Charley was with Ida-he was seldom far off-.'&#xD;
"November and June 1" exclaimed lie, aside. "Its' ez~ough to&#xD;
cause a man ~to forswear your sex, to see such a being a voluntary&#xD;
victim~ upon the altar of mammon."&#xD;
Ida caugi~t his arm; and seeing that she was fainting, he&#xD;
seized a bottle of cologne-water from th~ mantel;' and~ dashed a&#xD;
handful into helface, so quickly and dexterously,' that his nearest&#xD;
neighbors did not understand the movement. The powerful per-&#xD;
fume 'recalled her scattering senses. Charley put her in the&#xD;
corner of a sofa; and placed himself in front of' her, to screen&#xD;
her from observation, until her agitation should subside. It was&#xD;
quickly over; and only remarking-"You cannot get through&#xD;

the crowd just yet-sit still I" he continued fanning her, ~nd&#xD;
chatting, as if her illness were the most natural thing imagina-&#xD;
ble,-a matter of no moment. His eyes were as busy as his&#xD;
tongue; and in their apparently aimless rovi~gs, no group&#xD;
escaped scrutiny. He was fairly at fault; and opposed as the&#xD;
coi~clusion was to the premises he had assumed, was compelled&#xD;
to refer her attack to physical causes. Once, he fancied he saw&#xD;
an imploring agony in her eye, which entreated for help or com-&#xD;
fort; but while he looked, it disappeared, leaving a serenity that&#xD;
rebuked his suspicions.&#xD;
." Who is this Mr. Read is convoying this way ?" he inquired.&#xD;
"I ought to know him."&#xD;
"He is a stranger to me," replied Ida.&#xD;
"Miss Ross, Mr. Copeland fears. you will not recognize him,&#xD;
without a'second introduction," said the host.&#xD;
"And Mr. Copeland's fears were not groundless," said that&#xD;
gentlemaii, when his br er-in-law, was out of hearing. "A&#xD;
less modest individual ~ an myself might be dubious of the&#xD;
durability of an impression, made under such circumstances, as&#xD;
~ur 'briefest of brief interviews,-when I could have been, at&#xD;
best, but a fourth-rate, attraction. Mr. Dana-I believe I I need&#xD;
not excuse myself, for not, observing you before. This is abril-&#xD;
ha assembly, Miss Ross. I have been rating my excellent&#xD;
br h~r-in-law"---there was the least curl of scorn, upon his&#xD;
handsome mouth as he pronounced these words-" for deserting&#xD;
*    this galaxy of beauty to seek a mate in our gloomier regions."&#xD;
"Isolated stars often dispense more light than, the millions&#xD;
*   composing the galaxy," answered Ida.&#xD;
"I have thought the ,same, since I i~eached this corner," he&#xD;
*    returned, gallantly.. "I pt~rted with . a friend of yours, yester~&#xD;
day, who would not have granted me time to say a word for&#xD;
myself, if I had engaged to deliver a quarter of the messages&#xD;
he charged me with.~'&#xD;
"AhI who was so unreasonable ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Germaine, he replied, smiling, as the blood rose to her&#xD;
cheek. "He enacted Telemachus last summer, with a difference&#xD;
in the objectof his search."&#xD;
"But with a like terminatioii,'~ said' Charley, who seemed to&#xD;
understand the allusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes-as it proved; but he did not know it at that time. He&#xD;
called by to see me on his way home. He was in a deplorable&#xD;
state of mind; but I am happy to s~y that' the consolations of&#xD;
friendship were not unavailing. I have succeeded in inocula&#xD;
ting him with hopes of mo)re fortunate chances in future. Yes-&#xD;
'terday, he was~ ready to swear with ]3arnadine, that he 'would&#xD;
not die that day for any man's persuasion.&#xD;
"Had he. been long absent from his own neighborhood 7"&#xD;
asked Ida. "Did he speak of Dr. Carleton's family ?"&#xD;
"Frequently. They are in their usual health; I believe,&#xD;
although he was not explicit upon this point; all ideas con-&#xD;
nected with Poplar-grove having a marked proclivity backward.&#xD;
'Last summer' was the starting-point and terminus of his dis-&#xD;
course to me. I am going to say something rude, Miss Rosin&#xD;
Is the lady by the pier-table your cousin-german ?"&#xD;
"What if she were my sister ?"&#xD;
"I should say, with all frankness, that I could' not detect the&#xD;
family likeness. As she is not related by consanguinity or&#xD;
affinity, we will hope, .ben~volently, that her attendant is not&#xD;
*   constituted like my sister, who faints at passing a freshly-&#xD;
painted house; and furthermore award her praise for her libe-&#xD;
*   rarity. You have heard of th~ clay that lived with roses-do&#xD;
you think that gentleman would appreciate the apologue 7"&#xD;
Ida and Charley laughed, although the remark might have*&#xD;
been considered ill-natured. The pure red and white of the&#xD;
lady's face remained intact, but the gentleman's coat-sleeve had&#xD;
received a bountiful donation of flour or chalk from the snowy&#xD;
arm resting upon it.&#xD;
"Is not that your friend, Miss Read 7" pursued Mr. Copeland.&#xD;
"A pretty casket, but how frail to enshrine the spirit that&#xD;
speaks in those orbs'! There is stirring music there, on am,&#xD;
mistaken. Hear me, Miss Ross, before you annihilate me by a&#xD;
second look of reproof. We simple yeomen do. not get away&#xD;
from our farms often; and not above once in a lifetime happen&#xD;
upon such a godsend as this is, for adding to our slender stock&#xD;
of information. I am aboy of an inquiring mind, and my venera-&#xD;
ble and respected father's parting injunction was to keep my eyes,&#xD;
and ears open. You believe every word I am saying-I see it&#xD;
in your countenance. You do not f9ar to accept my arm for a&#xD;
promenade? Mr. 'Dana-au revoir."&#xD;

"I am afraid you have chosen an indifferent cicerone," said&#xD;
Ida.&#xD;
"How unjust! I repel the insinuation, and to prove my inno-&#xD;
cenco, will not ask a question concerning any one but yourself."&#xD;
"I will answer those upon any other subject more readily."&#xD;
".1 h~d not expected to find you one who would shirk inquiry&#xD;
into her character and' actions. Luckily I am not deputed to&#xD;

"Never Why the question ?"&#xD;
"It is the principal amusement h~re, I observe; and that&#xD;
reminded me of my curiosity to behol~ you, when I heard that&#xD;
you were, in this respect, an anomaly i~ your set."&#xD;
"Is your judgment so unsparing?" said Ida. "I know many,&#xD;
whose sentiments and' practices coincide, with n4ne; but before&#xD;
'i~ 'dispute,. let us have a clear sense of each others meaning.&#xD;
What is your definition of flirting 7"&#xD;
"With men, it signifies paying attentions that warrant the&#xD;
expectation' Qf courtship :-a formal declaration; or expressions&#xD;
which are tantamount to it, when we have no inclination or&#xD;
intention to fulfil an engagement of marriage. The man who&#xD;
does this, incurs the opprobrium of the community, unless the&#xD;
lady is as great an adept in the art as himself. Then, it is a&#xD;
harmless shau~ fight; no mischief done, and nobody to blame.&#xD;
'On the other ~ide, the hapless wight, 'who is worsted by a&#xD;
coquette, ha~ to bear ridicule, in addition to his bruises. She&#xD;
may beckon her victim on by smiles and blushes and haW-uttered&#xD;
fondness, actually give him the pledges, and admit him to the&#xD;
privileges of an accepted lover; and then laugh in the face of&#xD;
the fond fool, whose peace she has wilfully destroyed ;-an4 this&#xD;
sensible, charitable world claps its hands, and shouts 'bravo!&#xD;
for a clever woman!'"&#xD;
"No woman will acknowledge the truthfulness of this sketch,"&#xD;
rejoined Ida. "I have seen unthinking girls act thus; but we&#xD;
are cognizant of the cnime-not its punishment, which is inevita-&#xD;
ble and severe."&#xD;
"Thy settle down generally, like their neighbors, to a home&#xD;
and a husband," said Mr. Copeland.&#xD;
"This is their outward lot; who knows their inner ll~e ?"&#xD;
"The inner life of a woman! who, indeed! what a tissue of&#xD;

see that Pen with cerulean eyes, who is bowing to that gentle-&#xD;
man s petition for 'the pleasure of her h~id?' Again, that&#xD;
blanching cheek, as she murmured 'yes.~"&#xD;
"It is Lelia Arnold-..--my sister's bridesmaid. She is the love-&#xD;

not exist, but in this hot-house of flattery and pleasure.. Last*&#xD;

we were notified of her return by her driving ov~r, one day,&#xD;
attended by a handsome fellow, brother to the 'dear Annie'&#xD;
with whom she had been staying, The truth was out! The&#xD;
parade the family made of her disinterestedness and attachment&#xD;
to the invalid deceived my' sister, but not me. ~he aims at uni-&#xD;

my brutality. I think now I shall wait for a more convenient&#xD;

'A perfect woman, nobly planned,&#xD;
To warn, to comfort, to command,'&#xD;

"Are you well advised of this?' Her voice was very low.  1.&#xD;
"I wish I were as sure of a diadem.! and if I had it, I will&#xD;
not be' my own security, that she could not coax it from me,' in&#xD;
five minutes after it' came into my possession. Do not imagine&#xD;

"I do~ not know how to believe you !" said Ida, putting her&#xD;
hand confusedly tAicr forehead.&#xD;
"It is no private scandal ;-I do not retail such ,-the facts&#xD;
are notorious. Yet ask JJelen-ask any woman who 'knows&#xD;
society, ' and she will certify to the frequency of. these occur-&#xD;
rences-' crimes' you * called them-and the impunity with&#xD;
which they are committed."&#xD;
"It is a crime !" said Ida, wildly;-" an atrocious crime !"&#xD;
"My dear Miss Ross! one would think you were reprobating&#xD;
a highway murderer! Recover yourself-the perpetrators are&#xD;
your acquaintances and friends. Another set, Helen! does Mr.&#xD;
Read take the floor, too ?" he said to his sister, with the mock.&#xD;
ing smile Ida had noticed once before.&#xD;
"I do not know ;" she replied, carelessly. "He can take&#xD;
care of hhnself-"&#xD;
"Having nearly arrived at years of discretion ;" he concluded&#xD;
the sentence.&#xD;
Ida did not like the unnecessary taunt, nor the smile with&#xD;
which h~ turned to her.&#xD;
"Your naive abhorrence of flirtation, emboldens me to ask&#xD;
another question. Has disinterested affection an abode upon&#xD;
earth ?"&#xD;
"Are you infidel there also ?~' said Ida, lightly.&#xD;
"You evade. I a~k, no reply but that. You are a believer..;&#xD;
and while I was telling my story, your mind was running&#xD;
through the details of conduct, diametrically opposed to our fair&#xD;
friend's yonder.~~&#xD;
It was a random shot; but that it told, he was assured by&#xD;
the nervous tremor of her arm; and kindly violating his promise&#xD;
not to be inquisitive about his fellow-guests, returned to his jest.&#xD;
in g strain.&#xD;
was well that he did. She was fearfully tried. At Miss&#xD;
Ar~iold's entrance, she had known the original of "Lelia's"&#xD;
miniature; but cowering at the unexpected ordeal she must&#xD;
undergo, while she was beneath the same roof with herself, took&#xD;
ref ge in the hope that she wa~ deceived by an accidental resern-&#xD;
blance. Mr. Copeland had t~rn down this frail shelter, and&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONJ~.                  259&#xD;
&#xD;
added a new sorrow to the burden that was crushing her. Why&#xD;
was she made to hear this recital? Was there a "special 'Prob&#xD;
evidence" in his being Mr. Germaine's frie and singling her&#xD;
out among a hundred strangers? What dir ed his mind into&#xD;
the channel it ~ok? what pointed his finger to Lelia Arnold,&#xD;
and thereby probed her heart to its core? She had taught her-&#xD;
self to think of, and pray for 1d8 wife-the good and beautiful,"&#xD;
but not for this heartless coquette-" not for her! oh! my&#xD;
Father! I could have borne anything but this !" she cried, in&#xD;
bitterness of spirit. It was an experience which smites many&#xD;
with sore amazement--that it is easier to learn resignation for&#xD;
ourselves, than for those we love. She had begun her uninvitipg&#xD;
journey meekly; but rebelled that a cloud lowered over him.&#xD;
Night, morning passed-the afternoon was upon the wane,&#xD;
ere she gained fortitude of body and spirit, for a re-eneounter&#xD;
with the formidable stranger. A prop to her resolution was&#xD;
applied by Rachel, who "thought them young ladies must be&#xD;
having a mighty dull time. Mrs. Read nor Miss Josephine&#xD;
didn't leave their rooms from breakfast to( dinner; and looks&#xD;
like they moaned to stay thar, till plump night; and ~Mies&#xD;
Murray and Miss Arnold are wandering about, like lost sheep.&#xD;
I wish you was well enough to sit~with them awhile, Miss Ida."&#xD;
Matters were much as she had represented. Miss Arnold&#xD;
was watching the passers-by, with an ennuy~e air, and Miss&#xD;
Murray lounging in an easy chair, with a book. The latter&#xD;
arose with a cordial air.&#xD;
"I am glad you are able tq be with us again. You seem&#xD;
feeble, and we were uneasy lest fatigue might have made you&#xD;
sick."&#xD;
Miss Arnold bowed distantly, and held herself aloof during&#xD;
the 4ialogue that ensued. Id~ gathered courage as she wit..&#xD;
nessed her uninterested attitude, which could hardly have been&#xD;
feigned. She had not recognized her; or as she reflected, in&#xD;
her humility, was more probable, had never heard of her. The&#xD;
thought was unflattering, but there was relief in it. Miss&#xD;
Murray was affable and unaffected; her features only redeemed&#xD;
from plainness by their agreeable expression. They talked of&#xD;
the distinctive traits of town and country life. She "had nev~r&#xD;
resided in the city," Miss Murray said, "but had attended Mr.&#xD;

heard that they were there together, but in different classes.&#xD;
~cI do not remember~ seeing you," said she.&#xD;
"But I kne oui~ face, yesterday afternoon ;" was Miss&#xD;
Murray's reply.&#xD;
"Carry Carleton was your desk-mate, and Anna Talbot sat&#xD;
before you."&#xD;
They were at no loss for topics now; and "Alice" and "Ida"&#xD;
superseded the formal "Miss."&#xD;
"I read of Carry's marriage in the papers, but the name of&#xD;
her caro spo.~o has slipped my memory ;" said Miss Murray.&#xD;
"Dr. Dana, -he is an excellent young man; handsome,&#xD;
amiable, and has a high reputation as an intelligent man, and&#xD;
skilful physician.~~&#xD;
"Dana! was there a gentleman of tha name here last night ?"&#xD;
asked Alice.&#xD;
"Yes-his brother."&#xD;
"He was introduced to me ;"-and she laughed. "He is&#xD;
an original. I was highly entertained by his humorous say-&#xD;
ings."&#xD;
She was interested in Ida's graphic limning of his character.&#xD;
"He is an intimate friend of yours, then ?"&#xD;
"One of the best I have ;-the kindest of brothers."&#xD;
"I knew he was as good as funny, from his face. You saw&#xD;
him, Lelia ?"&#xD;
"Whom ?" asked she, without moving.&#xD;
"Mr. Dana, the humorous gentleman, I talked to so long, by&#xD;
the piano."&#xD;
"I saw him, but heard no humor. I thought him very&#xD;
stupid."&#xD;
Miss Murray reddened. "Why, Lelia! but ~QU are not a&#xD;
fair judge. If he had talked to you, you would not say so."&#xD;
"He 'bored' me for what seemed an eternity, but which, Mr.&#xD;
Copeland, who released me, said was only ten minutes," said&#xD;
she, carelessly.&#xD;
Miss Murray was content she should be silent, after this mal-&#xD;
apropos observation. Ida said "one must 'be well acquainte~i&#xD;
with him to appreciate him." Miss Arnold measured her froiji&#xD;
head to foot, and saying coldly, "I rarely err in a first opinion ;~'&#xD;
turned her blue eyes to the window again.&#xD;

The others were forgetting her in the deepening stream of&#xD;
chat, when she came to the fire-place. "I am chilly 1" she&#xD;
said, and throwing one of the sofa-pillows aIi~lice's feet, seated&#xD;
herself, and leaned her elbow upon her friend's lap. She was&#xD;
bewitchingly lovely-Ida owned; and so may have thought&#xD;
Richard Copeland, who kaypened to enter, just as she was&#xD;
settled.&#xD;
"Rehearsing tableaux, young ladies 1" said he. "Miss Ross&#xD;
-Miss Alice-good evening. You play humility, I perceive,&#xD;
Miss Lelia."&#xD;
She did not offer to rise. "Do not I become the char~ct~r ?"&#xD;
she inquired.&#xD;
"The character becomes you, at any rate. How have you&#xD;
wiled away the day, Miss Alice 7"&#xD;
Her sunshiny face made him as frank as herself, when he&#xD;
addressed her.&#xD;
"Oh 1" said she. "In sleeping, reading a~d eating, I con-&#xD;
trived to dispose of all but the past hour or tw~, of which Miss&#xD;
Ross has kindly relieved me."&#xD;
"I can testify to her adroitness in this particular," he replied~&#xD;
She did a little time-lifting for me last evening. Have you&#xD;
finished your official returns of 'killed, wounded and missing,'&#xD;
Miss Ross ?"&#xD;
"I suspect my bulletins would comprise most of the latter,"&#xD;
~aid Ida.&#xD;
"And mine I" echoed Alice.&#xD;
"There is one exception, at least," he returned, bowing.&#xD;
~c Decide between yourselves to whom the captive belongs."&#xD;
"May I be umpire 7" asked Miss Arnold, her cheeks dimpling&#xD;
mischievously.&#xD;
"When I was a boy, Miss Lelia, I read in an old spelling-&#xD;
book, of two cats, who came to the scratch over a peice of cheese,&#xD;
and agreed to refer its division to the monkey's arbitration. You&#xD;
have read it too, and recollect the catastrophe."&#xD;
He appeared to take pleasure in being as rude to her as the&#xD;
Better of politeness allowed; and she bore it patiently, without&#xD;
relaxing her efforts to please and attract.&#xD;
"Where are Helen and Miss Read 7" he asked of Alice. "Do&#xD;
all the duties of hospitality devolve upon Miss Ross 7"&#xD;

"They are resting, I suppose, to be blooming at the party&#xD;
to-night," replied she.&#xD;
"your roses, tli~i, are not so precious. Is this so ?"&#xD;
'!Say instead, .that they are perpetual," said Ida.&#xD;
Alice blushed and laughed.&#xD;
"Are we to be favored with our company, Miss Ross 7"&#xD;
inquired Mr. Copeland.&#xD;
"No, I do not keep late hours u til my health is confirmed."&#xD;
"What a pity 1" exclaimed Ali e. Do go! I shall feel so&#xD;
strange, so lonely 1"&#xD;
." Mr. Copeland will prevent tha ; and I make over to you&#xD;
my interest in my friend, Mr. Dana, for one evening."&#xD;
"Are ~you in th9 market for t~ie first bidder ?" said Miss&#xD;
Arnold, ifrith pretty archness, to th~ former gentleman.&#xD;
"If ]~Iiss Ross ~deases. I intended to ask permission to&#xD;
remain in my present~ quarters until the hour at which we ultra-&#xD;
fashionables go to rotiits; but if she banishes me sooner, I am&#xD;
proud to do her bidding, hard as it is."&#xD;
The lamps were lighted; and Mrs. Read conferred the further&#xD;
illumination of her presence.&#xD;
"Where's your liege-lord, my lady ?" asked her brother; and&#xD;
she replied, as she did, whenever she could, to inquiries con-&#xD;
cerning him-" Indeed, I do not know," and sank indolently&#xD;
upon a divan. The large, slumberous eyes did not brighten at&#xD;
his step inthe hall; and when she drew her dress aside to make&#xD;
room for him, it was with more thought for the costly fabric,&#xD;
than desire to have him near. Josephine came in, as the bell&#xD;
sounded for supper. It was a cheerful meal, in* spite of her&#xD;
haughty silence, and Ida's inward conflicts. Alice Murray's&#xD;
even spirits had an equalizing effect upon the varied tempera-&#xD;
ments around her; Miss Arnold was witty and charming. Ida&#xD;
could not deny her eyes the luxury of watching her animated&#xD;
countenance. whey feasted upon its beauty, until every thought&#xD;
was merged in admiration; and this, while, Mr. Copeland's&#xD;
sallies, were exclusively for herself. Mrs. Read. aroused from&#xD;
her proud languor, and. manifested a keen relish for the ridi-&#xD;
culous, and satirical powers, not inferior to her brother's. There&#xD;
was a veiled acrimony in their n~ann0r to each other, which&#xD;
impressed Ida with the belief of some unsettled feud, never lost&#xD;

sight of by either; and which she could not reconcile with&#xD;
Alice's assertiQn, that he was Mrs. Read's best-beloved brother.&#xD;
Their personal resemblance was marked; ~it gay and caustic&#xD;
as he was, there were scintillations of feeling in his dark eyes,&#xD;
which has burnt out, or were smothered in hers. "Ai~d how&#xD;
else could it be ?" she said to herself, as s~e looked at her dig-&#xD;
nified guardian, transformed for the nonc~, into the uxorious&#xD;
husband; and marvelled, for the thousandth time.-" What&#xD;
made her marry him ?"&#xD;
They were incredulous when Mr. Read said it was time to&#xD;
dress for Mrs. Talbot's.&#xD;
"You go with us, Richard ?" said his sister.&#xD;
"I will meet you there; I must go to my hotel awhile first."&#xD;
There could be no reason for this, yet Ida thought Miss&#xD;
Arnold's brow clouded.&#xD;
~ "Your hair was prettily arranged last night, Ida," said Alice.&#xD;
"Will you give me a few hints as to my coiffure ?"&#xD;
"With pleasure. I was about to ask if I could assist you in&#xD;
any way ?"&#xD;
So, instead of going off to her ~ sanctum," she busied herself&#xD;
in. the dressing-room. Alice laughed and talked incessantly;&#xD;
Miss Arnold was grave and mute, except when her maid paused&#xD;
for directions. She objected, in the mildest of tones, that there&#xD;
was not light enough upon her table a&#xD;
Alice," who sent a candle from , nd thanked "dear, obliging&#xD;
hers, without fearing she could&#xD;
not spare it.&#xD;
"I never looked so well in all my life !" said Alice, clasping&#xD;
her hands in pretended rapture. "I am all impatience to try&#xD;
the effect of my beauty. You have won me one admirer, Ida&#xD;

"Add me to the number,~~ said~ Miss Arnold, and gliding up,&#xD;
she kissed the rosy cheek.&#xD;
"0 Lelia! my darling 1" screamed .Alice. "My darling!&#xD;

and self in its sublime teachings ;-hours before' their return,&#xD;
she slept, peacefuUj, happily-i--such sleep as even in this life&#xD;
"He giveth His beloved."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
SUNDAY was rainy, and Ida was deprived of the opportunity&#xD;
of judging whether Miss Arnold's church behaviour was as Mr.&#xD;
Copeland had portrayed it. But she was to learn how just to&#xD;
life another part of his description was.&#xD;
The. morning, yawned through in the other apartments, passed&#xD;
swiftly in hers, in reading, study, and blessed communion with&#xD;
her Heavenly Friend.&#xD;
A low tap was heard at the door, and her "come in," an-&#xD;
swered by Miss Arnold.&#xD;
"Pray, keep your seat," said she, closing the door with a&#xD;
shiver, as the cold draught from the passage blew over her; "I&#xD;
have ransacked the parlor book-case in vain for Sabbath reading,&#xD;
and Alice said you could probably supply me.&#xD;
"My little library is at your service," said Ida, parting the&#xD;
curtains before a handsome set of shelves.&#xD;
"You have quite an extensive collection;" remarked Miss&#xD;
Arnold, patronisingly. She did not ask her to help her in the&#xD;
selection, and Ida returned to her chair. Miss Arnold pulled out&#xD;
one and another slowly, so as to consume as muen time as pos-&#xD;
sible in the occupation. Ida glanced up from time to time, to&#xD;
see what choice she made. A modest volume, presented by Mr.&#xD;
I*acy, stood near the centre of the top shelf.; and she looked up&#xD;
once as Miss Arnold was in the act of taking it down. She&#xD;
watched her with suspended breath. She read the title and.&#xD;
title-page, and shutting it, raised her arm to replace it; but a&#xD;
look of recollection flitted over her brow, and she reopened jtr-&#xD;
at the fly-leaf. Ida dropped her eyes instantly to the page&#xD;
before her, yet she saw as plainly as with her bodily organs of&#xD;
vision, that after reading what was. written tli.~re,-" Miss Ida&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosa, with the regards of M. Ii.," a gaze of keen inquisition rested&#xD;
upon herself, that the inscription was thoughtfully examined,&#xD;
s-then the subject matter of the book, which was afterwards&#xD;
restored to its place, and with another, selected at hazard, her&#xD;
visitor moved gracefully towards her. "You have been so kind&#xD;
to me-to us-during our stay here, that I am encouraged to&#xD;
beg an additional favor."&#xD;
Her silvery voice had a new tone, and it was as if a malicious&#xD;
spirit repeated to Ida,.--" If you are worth winning, she is&#xD;
the tender, love-beseeching giA." Hitherto, her conduct had&#xD;
afforded decisive evidence that she was not worth the trouble.&#xD;
She drove the whisperer away and answered politely,&#xD;
"I shall be happyto oblige you."&#xD;
"Then may I stay with you awhile? This is such a dear,&#xD;
home-like nook, and it is so dreary out of doors, and not much&#xD;
better down stairs, for Alice is drowsy, and Helen invisible."&#xD;
Ida would have acceded to almost any other proposition more&#xD;
readily, but she submitted with forced complaisance.&#xD;
"Go on with your reading. I shall retire if I interrupt you ;"&#xD;
continued Miss Arnold.&#xD;
"I have been reading afl the morning;" said Ida, seeing that&#xD;
the other's book was untouched.&#xD;
"And won't my talking annoy you ?" cried Miss Arnold with&#xD;
childish pleasure. "I have so longed to know you better-to&#xD;
get nearer to you! Bear with me while I say it; you are so.-.&#xD;
not exactly stern to me-but so distant! That it. was not your&#xD;
nature, I discovered from your demeanor to Alice. I could not&#xD;
but love you for your goodness to her; and---child that I am-I&#xD;
would have treatedd you to care for me a little in returns-but&#xD;
you froze the words upon my lips. I have cried over it after I&#xD;
went to bed at night. Will you not tell me truly why you dis-&#xD;
like me?"&#xD;
The violet eyes were sparkling through tears.&#xD;
"I was not aware that I was so frightful," replied Ida,&#xD;
smiling. "My coldness was imaginary, or unintentional on my&#xD;
part, Miss Arnold."&#xD;
There !" said the beauty reproachfully; "it was 'Alice'&#xD;
before you had known her a day."&#xD;
"Because we were old schoolmates.~'&#xD;

"Strangers, nevertheless. Come, Ida-be my friend-will&#xD;
you not ?"&#xD;
Could a false flirt copy Carry's look and tone so faithfully?&#xD;
and she kneeled upon the rug, as she had done on that November&#xD;
night, when she said, "Love me, Ida 1" She could not resist&#xD;
the temptation to lay her* lips against the snowy forehead,&#xD;
beneath which those matchless eyes beamed with love ~nd g~ati..&#xD;
tude. She wot~ld. have recoiled as that satiric whisper again&#xD;
hissed through her heart; but the soft arms were around her-&#xD;
the beautiful head upon her shoulder.&#xD;
"I am not the butterfly I seem, Ida; nor is the ephemera&#xD;
gaiety, in which you see me floating, my pr~~per sphere. I have&#xD;
not your unwavering principle-your independence; I cannot&#xD;
of myself say to the world,-' I hate your vain pageantry, and&#xD;
pine for ~ nobler life!' Often, often I feel when the din of&#xD;
pleasure is loudest, that I am bound to a wheel whose revolu-&#xD;
tions I cannot control. Show me how to be happy."&#xD;
"There is but one happiness which cannot die," said Ida,&#xD;
~vith an effort. "You do not require that I should point you&#xD;
to that!"&#xD;
Her look of sorrowful deprecation was touching. "I know&#xD;
~what you mean," she replied, subduedly. "You would imitate,&#xD;
that professing as I do, to be trying to lead a Christian's life, I&#xD;
ought to be/'as familiar with the path as yourself; but I am a&#xD;
~child-toomuchthetoyofimpulse and fancy. I have been a&#xD;
pet from my infancy; hav~ leaned upon the judgment-abided&#xD;
the decision of those I l~ve; and you cannot' conceive of the&#xD;
difficulty I have in acting f~r myself, and iZi opposition to their&#xD;
wishes."*&#xD;
This was plausible. Idt~wishea from her inmost soul, that&#xD;
she had never heard Richa d Copeland's story, which, after all,&#xD;
might have been coloured,. if not sketched by prejudice, or&#xD;
revenge for some slight to himself. She would have taken this&#xD;
young girl, his betrothed, to her bosom, and soothed her fears,&#xD;
and, stimulated her failing resolves. But the conviction of~ her&#xD;
heartlessness was too strong upon her; and her upright nature&#xD;
forbade the assumption ~ofan appearance of confidence she did&#xD;
not feel. She spoke, indeed, as. freely as she could Jf the love&#xD;
which pities and forgives our infirmities* and backslidings; but&#xD;

ALONE.                       267&#xD;
Lelia shook her head dejectedly. She "had not reached her&#xD;
case. I thank you, though, and love you I" She drew her&#xD;
cheek down to her lips. "ilave you had much sorrow ?"&#xD;
"Not more than falls to the* lot of many, more deserving of&#xD;
exemption.-.Why ?"&#xD;
"Your serenity is so remarkable; you seem never to have&#xD;
suffered."&#xD;
"The ocean is calm sometimes," said Ida,. unconsciously.&#xD;
"That is not your emblem," rejoined Lelia. "It is mine;&#xD;
ruffled by every breath-dark in storms-.--flashing and laughing&#xD;
in sunshine-always changing, yet always the same-and, ali!&#xD;
who believes that there are treasures under the waters which are&#xD;
worth th9 seeking ?"&#xD;
"The ocean is constant in nothing except change," said Ida.&#xD;
"That is the surface 1" she spoke exultingly-.....&#xD;
"The water is calm and still below;&#xD;
For the, winds and Waves are absent there,-&#xD;
And the Bands are bright as the stars that glow&#xD;
Iu the motionless fields of upper air."&#xD;
"Those are fine lines 1" said Ida. They were recited with a&#xD;
purity of tone and emphasis that lent them an additional charm.&#xD;
"They are Percival's," was the reply. "I love poetry, if I&#xD;
have not, like one of my friend, received the poetic afflatus.&#xD;
AhI Improvisatrice! did you think me ignorant of your glorious&#xD;
gift ?"&#xD;
"You honour my petty talent 'by a higher ~iame than it&#xD;
aspires to earn. Your informant was given to exaggeTration."&#xD;
"You do not ask who it was I" cried Lelia, peeping into her&#xD;
face. "AhI that blush! you surmise. Now my demure dar..&#xD;
ling,~ how will you excuse yourself for not having breathed his&#xD;
name in my hearing, when you knew how deep my interest is in&#xD;
all relating to him or his connections ?"&#xD;
This query was ably turned; but Ida's habitual self-control&#xD;
saved her from the pitfall. She would know and confess&#xD;
nothing.&#xD;
And you dare look in my eyes and deny one of your best&#xD;
friends ?" said Lelia.&#xD;
"I deny no one. The merest acquaintance may have imparted&#xD;
this information."&#xD;

"It was not a casual acquaintance. Shall I name him ?"&#xD;
'Tf you choose," said Ida, with quickened pulsation.&#xD;
"Then it was Mr.-look at me !-Mr. Germaine I"&#xD;
The blood flowed regularly again. Miss Arnold's ruse, if&#xD;
such was intended, failed signally; and Ida shortly had cause to&#xD;
congratulate herself upon the equanimity she had maintained&#xD;
through the interview.&#xD;
Lelia's friendliness continued without abatement; and herb&#xD;
predilection for her society was openly manifested. She invited&#xD;
her to walk on Monday afternoon, and was inconsolable for her&#xD;
refusal until Richard Copeland offered himself as a substitute.&#xD;
Alice rode out with Mrs. Read and Josephine; and Ida lay&#xD;
down at dusk upon a sofa, within a recess of the parlor. She&#xD;
soon dropped into a light slumber; and thought that she was&#xD;
dreaming still, when she heard voices, and saw, 'twixt sleeping&#xD;
an)1 waking, two figures, dimly visible in the fire-light.&#xD;
"You are cruelly unjust, Richard. Why seize upon every&#xD;
pretext to attack and wound one who never had an unkind&#xD;
thought of you ?"&#xD;
"Because 1 have no respect for you, Lelia," was the cool&#xD;
rejoinder. '4our trifling is disgracefuh-4nhuznan 1"&#xD;
"I never trifled with you?"&#xD;
~C For the best of reasons-you never had the chance. You&#xD;
will affirm tQo, that you did not design to coquet with Hilton&#xD;
or Sheppard."&#xD;
"Their unhappiness was the fruit of their own blind folly."&#xD;
"'Blind folly' it was to love a heartless woman I .And this&#xD;
Lacy-~u~e you retaining him as a corps de reserve 7"&#xD;
"He i~ nothing to me-."&#xD;
An eja~iulation of extreme disgust interrupted her "Now this&#xD;
is too much! Do you think then that a solitary manoeuvre has&#xD;
been uun4~ticed by me? that I have not divined even the motive&#xD;
of your altered behaviour to Niss. Ross? You have either&#xD;
guessed or heard what has be&amp;amp;n told me ~within a day or two-.&#xD;
that he was her lover last winter-either discarded, or engaged&#xD;
to her now. Eave a care! you may be foiled with your own&#xD;
weapons! 4dieu I" His mocking laugh rang through the&#xD;
room. Lelia. remained where. he left her; the ruddy glare&#xD;
lighting up features contorted by anger or grief. "Can it be ?" ~&#xD;
&#xD;
she said-." But, no 1" she smiled, contemptuously. dA made-&#xD;
up tale to work 'upon my jealousy! That matters not at&#xD;
present-but this-~-yet I am not discouraged-he is the-only&#xD;
one I" and muttering over--." lie is the only one I" she lifted&#xD;
her bonnet and shawl, and carried them from the apartment.&#xD;
Astonishment had chained Ida's limbs and tongue after she&#xD;
realized that she was awake. She grew weak and sick at the&#xD;
accomplished duplicity of one so youthful, so faultless in&#xD;
seeming ;-the winding of her arms about her neck-her&#xD;
kisses were like the coil and sting of a serpent. She detected&#xD;
the artfulness of her pretended confidence; her lures to inveigle.&#xD;
her into some embarrassment or admission which would betray&#xD;
her acquaintance with Mr. Lacy. Sh~ had suspected l~e~ then;&#xD;
the change of manner followed too soon upon the' recognition of&#xD;
the handwriting. She rejoiced that the house was to be freed&#xD;
of her on the morrow. If he could be warned! but this was a&#xD;
prohibited subject to thought as to words, and she was learning&#xD;
how to govern both. There was a soiree that evening, and Ida&#xD;
had never been more happy to see company. Alice and Lelia&#xD;
came together to her room to say farewell, for they were both to&#xD;
start early in the morning. She tried to treat them alike, but&#xD;
her regrets at losing them were addressed to Alice; and if they&#xD;
were heartfelt, the sigh of relief, with which she turned the bolt&#xD;
after them, was equally sincere.&#xD;
The bridal festivities were not over until after Christmas, but&#xD;
Ida avoided further participation in them by spending holiday&#xD;
week at Mr. Dana's. She was invited expressly to meet Carry&#xD;
and Arthur, and, although the precedence belonged to them, as&#xD;
more infrequentt visitors, she was installed in the seat of honour&#xD;
as chief guest. Carry inveighed~ against Mr. Read's marriage,&#xD;
and was anxious to learn whether it would render her position&#xD;
more unpleasant. Ida thought not :-her heart said this could&#xD;
hardly be, but she spoke hopefully of the wholesome check 'Mrs.&#xD;
Read'selegant propriety would be upon Josephine's brusqueness.&#xD;
"They will not agree at first, for Mrs. Read, if she' does appear&#xD;
too fond of her ease to contend, is not deficient 'in resolution;&#xD;
yet the end may be mutual' endurance and forbearance. In any&#xD;
event I shall remain neutral. Who knows, Carry, but, un-&#xD;
promising as the field is, I may do as well as suffer, even there ?"&#xD;

'They were alone in Carry's room. "There is one subject,&#xD;
upon which I wish to speak to you;" said the latter, seriously.&#xD;
"Has Arthur said anything to you of himself ?"&#xD;
"No-not particularly."&#xD;
"He was always too good for me," pursued Carry. "You&#xD;
need not hold up your finger so threateningly-but for a year&#xD;
past, I felt that he was growing better, while I made no progress.&#xD;
After we were married, I discovered that he was in the habit ot&#xD;
the daily study of his Bi~de, and secret prayer. I did not hint&#xD;
that I knew it, for it was too sacred a matter for mc to touch.&#xD;
Ida! I suffered I he had a care which I could not share-was ill&#xD;
at ease, and I mjist not cheer him~ When you wrote, recounting&#xD;
the alteration of  your vieWs and prospects, he unsealed his heart&#xD;
to me. He had long sought peace, without finding it; but&#xD;
latterly, had experienced a glimmering hope he feared to divulge,&#xD;
so faint was it-that he was a child of God. I wept for joy and&#xD;
grief-joy, for I was sure, although he was not, that he was a&#xD;
Christian ;-.an 'grief at my own hardness of heart. His light&#xD;
has burned bri ter and brighter every day; and he is prepared&#xD;
now to avow t to his friends and the world. He says your&#xD;
fearlessness, in clearing your principles, filled him with shame,&#xD;
and ui~ged him to emulate your example."&#xD;
on shea%~--an earnest of whitening harvest. The&#xD;
Redeemer% of opportunities for~ serving and honoring her&#xD;
was a: troublesome stumbling-block. Her sphere of&#xD;
useft~lness. was o limited; and she had talents, which might be&#xD;
deplored to so e purpose in a larger arena. The glowing zeal&#xD;
of young con ert called for action. In a moment of discontent&#xD;
pith herself, a d perhaps with her situation, she had expressed&#xD;
this to Charley ~ silenced her with one line-&#xD;
"' hey also serve, who only stand and walt."'&#xD;
The intelligeuc of Arthur's conversion was~an unlooked-for and&#xD;
refreshing ele ent' in her week's felicity. "Now, Charley, one&#xD;
thing more 1" sh~ said, when they were talking it over. She&#xD;
seldom made a pointed appeal, although he always took it kindly.&#xD;
He did not r fleet her smile-he only said, gravely ;-" You&#xD;

her uncongenial home. "Ah, well! it's callers been my expe.&#xD;
rien6e that molasses and water is mighty apt to sour, if it's kept;&#xD;
and it don't deceive me now," remarked the oracular, Rachel,&#xD;
with the decline of the honeymoon. The metaphor was apt.&#xD;
Mr. Read's fondness was the saccharine that~ qualified the insi-&#xD;
pidity of his wife's apathy. He had been elevated to the&#xD;
seventh heaven of ecstacy, at his triumph over a host of rivals,&#xD;
younger ~than himself. Her evident preference had incited him&#xD;
to the contest, and he had no misgivings of its reality. She was&#xD;
"a splendid woman 1" liFe delighted in exhibiting her; and&#xD;
hearing this from all sides, with compliments and congratula-&#xD;
tions to himself. But this ~renewal of youth was evanescent.&#xD;
He had counted more than half a century--she, not a quarter;&#xD;
and outraged nature revenged herself for his infatuation in striv-&#xD;
ing to overlap this mighty gap. She was a "splendid woman I"&#xD;
that was unquestionable; but as he mounted guard, from ten at&#xD;
night to two or three o'clock in the morning against the wall of&#xD;
the assembly-room, waiting for her to dispatch the list of part-&#xD;
ners that covered both sides of her tablets-he tired and moped,'&#xD;
and stupidly wondering if the radiant creature, whose laugh came&#xD;
to him with each whirl of the interminable waltz, were in truth&#xD;
married, and his wife! it is problematical if he' derived perma-&#xD;
nent consolation from the well-timed praises of his old friends,&#xD;
who facetiously inquired if he were not "jealous of his pretty&#xD;
bird"-or felt greatly flattered by the fine things, comparative&#xD;
strangers were saying about "his daughter. She was a "splen-&#xD;
did woman I" and she shone most at the largest party of tlxt~&#xD;
winter, where everybody danced (she most syiph-like of all)&#xD;
except the papas and mammals, and the "past-worthy" chaperons.&#xD;
The rooms were hot :-the dancers must have air.-the windows&#xD;
were robbed of their sashes. Mr. Read was in a draught.-what&#xD;
of that? the reflection of his wife's splendor should have warned&#xD;
him., She was not uncomfortable ;-so she glided and pirouetted&#xD;
and swam by in the polka, and he shook as if he weye afflicted&#xD;
with a dance of quite another name. An attack of inflammatory&#xD;
rheumatism was the finale. His life was in danger for awhile;&#xD;
and to his wife's credit, be it said, she nursed him~ dutifully, if&#xD;
not affectionately, until he entered upon his convalescence.&#xD;

A few mornings after the doctors announced his safety, Ida&#xD;
observed, at breakfast, that Mrs. Read was looking badly.&#xD;
"Confiuemei$ in a sick-room does not agree with you, I fear,"&#xD;
said she, with interest. "We must not let you fall ill, too.&#xD;
Will you not delegate one of us to represent you this forenoon,&#xD;
while you take a ride ?"&#xD;
"Constant attendance is unnecessary," she replied. "Here-&#xD;
after, I shall not stay in doors as I have been doing. I thank&#xD;
you for your offer, however. If I can avail myself of it, I will&#xD;
do so."&#xD;
"Why did he not come down to breakfast ?" asked Josephine,'&#xD;
ironically.&#xD;
"He cannot leave his bed ;" was the calm reply.&#xD;
"~or tuTrn himself in it, I believe, madam ?"&#xD;
"You are right."&#xD;
"It must cost you a pang to surrender, to another the privi-&#xD;
lege of allaying his pains, and paying those endearing little&#xD;
attentions, to which affection imparts such sweetness. How can&#xD;
you think of it?"&#xD;
"I do not consider my health unimportant."&#xD;
"Not in comparison with his ?" continued Josephine, pro&#xD;
jokingly.&#xD;
"The duty is not rendered less imperative by any compari-&#xD;
son."&#xD;
"The pursuit of pleasure and ease is included in this prudent&#xD;
care of yourself, I presume, madam ?"&#xD;
"In that, as in everything else, I shall consult my own inch&#xD;
nations."&#xD;
"I did not know that a woman had a will of her own after&#xD;
she married," retorted Josephine.&#xD;
"I am not conscious of having lost my volition or free&#xD;
agency."&#xD;
"And acting upon this unbiased volition, you will occupy&#xD;
your bbx at the theatre to-night. I saw a ticket upon the table&#xD;
in the parlor."&#xD;
"I shall be there; but there will be room for you, and what~.&#xD;
ever friend you honor by accompanying.".&#xD;

place in the city 1"&#xD;
"If you have more remarks of like import to make, I' will&#xD;
hear* them in your father's presence, Miss Read," answered the&#xD;
unruffled step-mother. "Miss Ida, please excuse my withdraw-&#xD;
ing before you have finished your 'breakfast."&#xD;
Josephine had emphatically, picked this quarrel. She. had&#xD;
received no provocation, and combined with this disadvantage,&#xD;
that of loss of temper. Chafing with anxiety to commence' t~ie&#xD;
warfare she had declared, she was too eager to wait for a pretext;&#xD;
and had plunged into a rash conflictt, before estimating the&#xD;
strength of the enemy's forces. Ida said nothing, until she was&#xD;
ready to leave the room. She deemed it her duty to speak.&#xD;
"Josephine," said she, mildly, "it is not my place to dictate&#xD;
to you; but as a well-wisher, I warn you not to carry this&#xD;
further. Constar~t dissension will be the only result. She is&#xD;
inclined to live peaceably with you; and she will be a dangerous,&#xD;
a powerful enemy."&#xD;
"Have I asked your advice?" said Josephine. Her scowl dis-&#xD;
suaded Ida from a second remonstrance. In reckless audacity,&#xD;
she proceeded straight to her father's chamber. It was pitiable&#xD;
to see that gray-haired man-.helpless as infancy with disease,&#xD;
and remember that his frayed thread of life was entwisted with&#xD;
the golden cord of hers, ~ho had barely attained the meridian of&#xD;
her early womanhood.&#xD;
Josephine's visits had been rare and brief, and his salutation&#xD;
was surly. "To what am I indebted for this superlative plea-&#xD;
sure ?" he inquired, stretching his upper lip, across his teeth, as&#xD;
was his wont, when displeased.&#xD;
"If I had supposed that my presence was conducive to your&#xD;
comfort, no 'consideration should have detained me from you&#xD;
sir," was the meaning rejoinder..&#xD;
He did not answer, but moved uneasily, and asked his wife&#xD;
for water. The goblet was nearest Josephine, and she held it&#xD;
to him. "Lift my 'head I" he said, fretfully, "Ugh! you hurt&#xD;
me! this comes of your officiousness. Why couldn't you let her&#xD;
do it 7"&#xD;

"1 regret, sir, that my nuskilful touch is painful," said Jose&#xD;
phine, "since ~rou are to, be dependent upon my cares."&#xD;
"What the deuce are you talkir~g about ?" he demanded,&#xD;
sharply.&#xD;
The slumberoi~ eyes surveyed her listlessly over the couch.&#xD;
"My speech is blunt, sir; I learned it from you, and I have&#xD;
an inconvenient practice of saying what I think. Old men, who&#xD;
have young and fashionable wives, should not indulge, in the&#xD;
luxury of sickness. What woman, who has a right appreciation&#xD;
of her charms, can hesitate what course to pursue, when a&#xD;
dei~repid husband is put in one scale-society and a score of&#xD;
beaux in the other ?"&#xD;
His glare of impotent fury was demoniacal-he was too weak&#xD;
to control it. The liquid eyes were dreamy and motionless still.&#xD;
The irascible old man jerked his head so that he could see her&#xD;
face-" Helen! wh~t is that girl driving at ?"&#xD;
"She can best explain herself, sir~"&#xD;
"Speak!" he commanded, at the top of his tremulous v9ice.&#xD;
"I hope yon have made your will, sir ;" said Josephine,&#xD;
deliberately.&#xD;
"By my life, I will do it, and cut you off, without a copper,&#xD;
if you parley much more I"&#xD;
"You virti~ially severed our connection two months ago, sir.&#xD;
A stranger has supplanted me in your heart and house; a~id up&#xD;
to this time, I have held my peace. This is my revenge. ~Your&#xD;
idol, having used you for her pleasure and advancement, do~s not.&#xD;
mean that this sickness, caused by your dating, indulgence,&#xD;
shall fetter her dainty limbs. On the contrary, it frees her from&#xD;
the restraint of your observation,-the. incumbrance of your&#xD;
attentions."&#xD;
She dropped each word slowly, purposely ~to aggravate his&#xD;
impatience, which was now frightful. Manacled, bound down&#xD;
by the fiery bands of his malady, he writhed, as upon a Procrus-&#xD;
tean bed.&#xD;
"Helen! . speak! tell her she lies 1"&#xD;

"The theatre ~" he uttered. "Are you going, and with&#xD;
whom 7"&#xD;
"With Mr. and Miss Talbot ;" and save that she fastened&#xD;
her gaze upon him, instead of her, she looked and spoke the&#xD;
same.&#xD;
"The 'Miss,' is an adroit addenda," sneerec~ Josephine.&#xD;
Her father was silent. His selfishness was wounded. He&#xD;
was angered and mortified that his wife should consign him to&#xD;
the care of others and find enjoyment in gay recreations, while&#xD;
he lay crippled and~rack4~d; but he detected the spring of Jose-&#xD;
phine's interfer~ce, and pride cried loudly that her impertinent&#xD;
malice should b~~uished. A study of his wife's determined&#xD;
face settled the pbint. If they differed, the mischief-maker should&#xD;
not know it. "Hark you I" said he, with sudden composure.&#xD;
"I ~ee your game, my lady, and you may as well throw up your&#xD;
cards. I am master in my house, and there is no law against&#xD;
turning you out of it. I thought I had taught you this already.&#xD;
I have a piece of advice, you will do well to bear in x~iind.&#xD;
Attend to your own business, and let your betters alone. Now,&#xD;
be off! and don't let me see you again until you can behave&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;

Mr. Read was awkwardly embarrassed, when left with his&#xD;
wife. Domineering and stubborn as he was, she awed him.&#xD;
Her haughty endurance of his foolish. fondness gave him no lien&#xD;
upon her affections; and the sang-froid, she had preserved under&#xD;
~ insolence, was a bad augury of the efficacy of&#xD;
reproaches. She consulted her watch, and informed him that it&#xD;
was the hour for his medicine; administered it, and shook up&#xD;
his pillow.&#xD;
"Helen," said he, coaxingly, "are you in earnest about leaving&#xD;
me? What shall I do ?"&#xD;
"Sarah will wait upon you. I have the utmost confidence in&#xD;
her fidelity."&#xD;
"But what is a servant's nursing, after yours ?"&#xD;

attentions but mine. My health and spirits are injured by&#xD;
fatigue and want of rest. You are recovering, there is no abso..&#xD;
lute* necessity for my remaining with you; and it is necessary&#xD;
that I should take care of myself. We had best suspend this&#xD;
diseu~sion, Mr. Read9 You have been too much excited this&#xD;
morning; and arguments are useless, as my plans are made."&#xD;
And "my plans are made" became the law of the household,&#xD;
.~..~.Josephine ezeepted, who had her schemes also. There was an&#xD;
ominous calm. Mr. Read mended gradually. His daughter's&#xD;
resentment outlived his; but his pride was as inflexible as ,hers.&#xD;
She would not enter his chamber, and he would not recall her.&#xD;
His wife performed mechanically a-routine of duties, self-enjoined,&#xD;
as covering all that could be required of her. The residue of her&#xD;
time was devoted to the world, out of which, she did not seem&#xD;
to tive. She held her position as leader of the ton. She was&#xD;
the best-bred, best-dressed, and best-educated woman of her&#xD;
circle. No party was complete without her; and none vied with&#xD;
hers, in elegance and agreeableness. People gossipped, and&#xD;
propl~ecied, and pitied her "poor old husband"-courted and&#xD;
ape~4her. Ida had made a public profession of her faith, and was&#xD;
humbly "waiting." Her health did not now debar her from&#xD;
mingling in society; and she could discern neither wisdom nor&#xD;
piety in a hermit's life. Her re-appearance amongst them was&#xD;
hailed. with: exclamations by most of her acquaintances. some&#xD;
were shy for a t~ime, thanks to Josephine's exposition of her&#xD;
straitlacedd notions ;" but her cheerful frankness banished their&#xD;
reserve; and if not so noisily admired, she was more beloved&#xD;
than in her palmy days.&#xD;
She was one evening at a "sociable" at Mrs. Morris', the&#xD;
cynosure of a group, the liveliest in the room, for it comprised&#xD;
J~llen, Mr. Thornton, Charley, Mr. Germaine, Mr. Villet, and&#xD;
Richard Copeland. Charley was relating an amusing story; and&#xD;
Ida's peculiarly contagious laugh created as much merriment as&#xD;
the anecdote.&#xD;
"Miss Ross is ever happy," said Mr. Villet. "Your being&#xD;
devoted does not make you sad, morose-comme 4 1'ordinaire."&#xD;
A glance of apprehension was exchanged by some of the circle;&#xD;
and Ida colored, as she replied, smiling, "I do t know why it&#xD;
should, Mr. Villet."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders: "Nor I! I do not&#xD;
comprehend these affairs myself, but it is usual, I believe, for the&#xD;
visible visage to elongate with ~the expansion of the-~-'qu'ese cc&#xD;
gue c'est ?-grace in the soul."&#xD;
There w~s a laugh. Charley and Ida were grave; and Mr.&#xD;
Villet's politeness took the alarm. "I entreat your pardon,&#xD;
Miss Ross; I did not meditate an offence."&#xD;
"You have given none," answered she. "You would not&#xD;
knowingly make sport of what you must respect. Religion is&#xD;
not gloomy, nor is it; ridiculous."&#xD;
"Its professors, with some honorable exceptions, are one or&#xD;
the other," said Richard.&#xD;
"This is their misfortune or failing, not the fault of the&#xD;
system," returned Ida. "Mortal nature is fallible, Mr. Cope-&#xD;
land."&#xD;
"You admit it, then ?" said Mr. Thornton. "The greatest&#xD;
objection I have to pious people is that they do not permit this&#xD;
indulgence to abused human nature. They wind themselves up&#xD;
in their impenetrable cloaks of sanctification and perfectionism,&#xD;
~nd send us-no matter where-for hankering after innocent&#xD;
8musements. And if one of their caste beats time to a merry&#xD;
tune, or shows hi~ head inside of a theatre, lie is run down as&#xD;
if he had the hydrophobia. Such sermons as they preach about&#xD;
the hand or foot offending! It would be a wise precaution, in&#xD;
my judgment, to make the amputation of the feet part of the&#xD;
ceremony of initiationinto church membership. You are superior&#xD;
to such narrow-mindedness, I hope, Miss Ida ?"&#xD;
"If 'narrow-mindedness' signifies drawing a distinct line of&#xD;
demarcation between the church and the world, I shall come&#xD;
under your lash, Mr. Thornton."&#xD;
"Anc~ do you, candid, and liberal as you are, declare..4at&#xD;
there is sin-mind you! a 'want. of conformity to, or transgres-&#xD;
sion of the law of God'-.-.in moving through a certain form of&#xD;
steps to the sound of music ?" said he, indignantly.&#xD;
"I do not profess to see sin in the mere act of dancing,"&#xD;
replied~ Ida; "but-I do not wish to argue, Mr. Thoriiton. If&#xD;
nothing else forbade my joining in the amusement, it is prohi..&#xD;
bited by the church to which I belong."&#xD;
Worse                  24&#xD;

pocket book. If your church commanded you to steal or kill,&#xD;
would you obey ~"&#xD;
"No; for a higher law forbids it. I am bound to follow the&#xD;
church only so f4r as it follows the Bible."&#xD;
"But the Bible says there is a time to dance."&#xD;
"Ida smiled; "I am surprised " said she, "that sensible per~&#xD;
sons should quote that poor text so frequently, as authority for&#xD;
dancing. In the same connection we read, (there ~s a time to&#xD;
kill ;'-you would be loath to defend a murderer ~ho justified&#xD;
his crime by an appeal to this passage. 'A time to die ;'-who&#xD;
sees in this permission to shorten his days ?"&#xD;
~~And you ~nust turn pavior, Thornton, because' 'there is a&#xD;
time to gather ~tones together,'" said Charley.&#xD;
There was ~other laugh, in which Mr. Thornton joined&#xD;
good-humoredl~. "Weak as my text is, I am consoled by the&#xD;
~knowledge that you cannot produce one interdicting that which&#xD;
reason and observation teach is not reprehensible."&#xD;
"Not an explicit prohibition, perhaps," answered she, hesi-&#xD;
tating.&#xD;
"Well an implied one, then ?"&#xD;
Ida's cheeks flushed, painfully, but her voice was firm as she&#xD;
said, "I read, ~Be ye not conformed' to the world;' and 'What-&#xD;
soever ye do, do' all to the honor and glory of God,' and my&#xD;
conscience says I would be guilty of wilful disobedience to the&#xD;
written commandment, and dishonor my profession, if I disre-&#xD;
garded the plain meaning of these words."&#xD;
Charley had bided his time. She stood the test well, and he&#xD;
came in to the rescue. "She is right, Thornton. You~ and I&#xD;
know it-why dispute it? Only yesterday, you were laughing&#xD;
at the inconsistency of the 'dancing Christians' you frolicked&#xD;
with down ,the country.~~&#xD;
"I commended their liberality, their freedom from supersti-&#xD;

"Humbug! you said-' they have found a road to the Odes..&#xD;

unites himself with the church, let him live as if he were changed.&#xD;
I go to the theatre, although I do not consider it the best school&#xD;
of morals one can frequent; but it grieve me to see, in my&#xD;
neighbor, a so-called pious man. I am ashamed for him-my&#xD;
respect for the reputation of his church is greater than his. I&#xD;
dance-and sleep afterwards with an easy conscience; but if you&#xD;
ever see me 'tripping on the light fantastic toe,' with an angelic&#xD;

Charley was lawless. Nobody criticized or was offended with&#xD;
him; and Ida was always certain of finding in him, an ally and&#xD;
advocate; but grateful as she was for his ready aid, upon occa~-&#xD;
sions like the present, she prized more highly the counsels,&#xD;
which 'his knowledge of mankind, and his undeviating sense of&#xD;
rectitude qualified him to give. She had faults,.-he pointed&#xD;
them out; she erred in judgment,-he corrected the evil as far&#xD;
as he could. The spectacle of his daily life was useful. lie&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
Mi~. READ was in his private sitting-room ;-it adjoined his&#xD;
chamber, and his longest walk was from one apa1~tment to the&#xD;
other. The sun beamed cheerfully through the damask curtains,&#xD;
and the fire blazed and crackled in the gate; but, wrapped&#xD;
in his 'wadded dressing-gown, his feet sunk heavily into a&#xD;
cushion, and hisAface contracted into a fretful frown, he appeared&#xD;
to be enduring the extreme of cold and discomfort. He was a&#xD;
sorry picture of a three months' bridegroom. His surroundings&#xD;
were tasteful and luxurious,-books and' papers and pictures and&#xD;
handsome furniture, and at his elbow stood a silver handbell,&#xD;
whose tongue would bring an obsequious servant, ready to per-&#xD;
form hi~ bidding; yet his sigh, as he ildgeted uneasily in his&#xD;
downy fauteuil, was a groan of repining.-"Like a jaded old&#xD;
hack! they won't knock him in the head, in consideration of&#xD;
past services; but he may die as soon as he can-the quicker the&#xD;
better I"&#xD;
~" Thp Northern papers have come, sir, and I thought you&#xD;
would like to see them;" said a gentle voice. It was his ward.&#xD;
A grunt an4 a gesture bade her put them upon the stand.&#xD;
"Are you in pain this afternoon ?" she asked, sympathizingly.&#xD;
"I am always in pain !"&#xD;
"Can I do anything for you ?"&#xD;
"No 1" He reached for the papers; but a twinge in his shoulder&#xD;
forced him to drop' them. Ida picked them up. The desolate&#xD;
old man excited her sincerest pity.&#xD;
"It must weary you, holding those lar~e sheets; and the print&#xD;
is fine. If you will designate the articles you wish read, I will&#xD;
do it for you with pleasure."&#xD;
The offer was tempting, although its acceptance was ungra-&#xD;
cious. He pointed to a piece, and she removed her bonnet and&#xD;
seated herself near him. He did not inquire if she were going&#xD;
out, and she did not make her sacrifice meritorious in his eyes,&#xD;
by informing him that she gave up her walk to minister to his&#xD;
enjoyment. She read well ;.-her voice was exquisitely m~du-&#xD;

lated; her enunciation perfect; Mr. Read forgot to be peevish,&#xD;
and his corrugated forehead lost half its wrinkles. When she&#xD;
ceased, he seemed to have been lulled by a strain of music. The&#xD;
article selected was an editorial leader on political economy,&#xD;
unintelligible and prosy to Ida; but she endeavored not to let this&#xD;
appear. He nodded, and stripped the envelop'~ from another&#xD;
sheet. His eye gleamed, and with an approach to a smile, he&#xD;
showed her six columns of an oration ;.-a grand effort of the&#xD;
immortal sage of Marshfield. J~ia was appalled at the superficies&#xD;
of the solid mass, but she said over to herselI~, a verse she had&#xD;
lisped at her mother's knee.&#xD;
"Did I this day, for small or great,&#xD;
My own pursuits forego,&#xD;
To lighten, by a feather's weight,&#xD;
The load of human woe ?"&#xD;
and began the terrible undertaking. The preamble over she&#xD;
became insensibly interested. Her soul-lit face and ringing in-&#xD;
tonations supplied to the auditor, the actual presence of the&#xD;
orator; he looked and listened until the light failed; then&#xD;
rang for candles. Mrs. Read, returning from her airing, seated&#xD;
herself silently by the fire. It was the prettiest domestic scene&#xD;
that had ever been witnessed in that house; and how little&#xD;
reality was there in its air of home-happiness!&#xD;
"Is that all ?" asked Mr. Read, at supper-time.&#xD;
"Almost, sir. I can soon finish it. I will not detain you Mrs.&#xD;
iRead." But she waited to hear the conclusion. A gruff "Thank&#xD;
you," was Ida's only reward, besides the praise of her conscience;&#xD;
and her tired throat obliged her to refuse Charley his 'favorite&#xD;
song that night, but she did not repent. She volunteered her&#xD;
services whenever she knew that there were new books or journals,&#xD;
and at length, the latest intelligence was distasteful, unless it&#xD;
caine through her lips. It was a selfish gratification; and she&#xD;
did not delude herself with illusions of personal attachment. She&#xD;
stroke to live for the benefit and pleasure of her fellow-beings; to&#xD;
leave' h~r interest and ease out of sight; and she could not have&#xD;
been in a better school, The woman's heart was not still. There&#xD;
were moments of weariness and longing, and passionate regrets.&#xD;
The soul, refusing the realities, which made up the sum of every-&#xD;
d~y duty, pined for the remembered "Dream Land ;"-~---its retreat,&#xD;

and 'the scene of its holiday revels ;-and when the aching and&#xD;

Mrs. Dana, or a friendly act of (iharley's-.dear and thoughtful&#xD;

The Sabbath was a season of delight. A band of little girls&#xD;
watched eagerly for her at Sabbath-school. Inclement indeed&#xD;
must the day be, that saw~ their form vacant; for she was always&#xD;
at her post,' and regarded snow and rain as minor hindrances&#xD;
when her flock nestled closely to "dear Miss Ida." No class&#xD;
loved their teacher an4 their ,Bible so well as hers; her co-labo-&#xD;
rers said she had a secret spell, by which she won and governed&#xD;
them; and she had,-for she was ever mindful that she had&#xD;
another account to render than her report to the Superinten-&#xD;
*      dent, and prayed that it might be-" Those whom Thou gayest&#xD;
~me, I have kept, and nope of them is lost." 'She loved her&#xD;
pastor; hut' her aquaintance with him was slight. He visited her&#xD;
at stated times, and esteemed her an ~"amiable girl, with a credit-&#xD;
able fund' of general information ;" he "could not know the exer-&#xD;
cises of all his members ;" and that a woman whose life was so&#xD;
unchecke~ed, ~hould have any difficulties and sorrows, but such&#xD;
as are incidental to the' experience of every Christian, i~ever&#xD;
crossed his brain. But he was a faithful expounder of the Scrip-&#xD;

which never released him from the text to the "Aine. "Qf his&#xD;

"spake often to one another;" and imagined,, in her simplicity,&#xD;
that such intercourse would be of mutual comfort and profit;&#xD;

There was an exception-.-.~ minister from another State, with&#xD;
whom she once dined at Mr. Dana's; a merry-hearted, whole-&#xD;
souled man, whose store of anecdote and pleasantry enlivened the&#xD;
company at table ;-and after dinner, gathering from a passing&#xD;
remark, that she was a professing Christian, he sought her out;&#xD;
and while the rest were busy about other matters, they were&#xD;
talking of the "peace which passeth understanding," and the&#xD;
home in preparation for them ;-.not with austere gravity, but,&#xD;
easily and happily, as befitted a topic so inspiriting. They sepa-&#xD;
rated.~-not to meet again in time; and Ida went on her way,&#xD;
cheered and strengthened by the interview, and hoping to thank&#xD;
him in heaven, for the seed he had sowed by the wayside-.-..not&#xD;
in the Scriptural sense of the term.&#xD;
Mr. Read's disease assumed a chronic type. Some days well&#xD;
enough to transact business in person,-.then relapsing, in con-&#xD;
sequence ot~ trifling exposure or change of weather, his existence&#xD;
was a series of anxieties und sufferings. Ida did not know h~w&#xD;
she became his nurse; Josephine would not endure his petulance,&#xD;
and her retorts exasperated him; and his wife was too daep in&#xD;
the vortex of fashion ble life to waste many minutes upon him;&#xD;
it was unjust and unfee'liiig to abandon him to the care of menials;&#xD;
and as with her reading, what was a favor, voluntarily offered,&#xD;
came to be regarded as a duty, expected and unrequited. The&#xD;
Danas objected to this thankless sacrifice; but .she~ persisted.&#xD;
It was during one of his worst spells, that an incident occurred,&#xD;
which she did not heed at the time, but when recalled by sub-&#xD;
sequent events, was fraught with meaning. ITt was in the evening;&#xD;
and she was on her way to the dining-room, to order a cup of&#xD;
tea for the invalid, when the light streaming through a crack in&#xD;
the parlor-door suggested the probability that the servant she was&#xD;
in quest of, was lighting the lamps in there. She pushed the&#xD;
door open. Mrs. Read was in the middle of the room, her face&#xD;
averted, and her arm extended in repulsion or denial, towards&#xD;
a tall, 4~rkin~n, who was speaking in a low, excited tone..&#xD;
'Forget~ ~' not forget~ that circumstances are not what they&#xD;
were'then ~" was all that Ida heard, as she retired haI~til~y and&#xD;

unseen. As she passed through the entry, she caught a noisc~, like&#xD;
the rustle of drapery, but supposed it to be the waving of her&#xD;
dress in the mind. Mr. Read was in agony; and Ida sent to&#xD;
request Dr. Ballard's immediate presence. The messenger's&#xD;
steps were not cold upon the stairs, when ~the sick man tor-&#xD;
mented himself with impatience for the physician's arrival.&#xD;
"If the servant had a pass, it was not signed-if it was signed,&#xD;
he had lost it-if be had lost it, Ballard would wait to eat hi&#xD;
supper, before he came. I wish he had this shooting fire through&#xD;
his limbs! It would put some speed into his lazy body! AhI&#xD;
there he his !"&#xD;
It was Mrs. Read, who meeting the servant with the tea, and&#xD;
hearing of her husband's state, had taken it from hi~m. Ida,&#xD;
pre-occupied as she was, noticed that she was pale and agitated.&#xD;
Her voice too, was tremulous,~ and had a cadence that might have&#xD;
been mistaken fortenderness.&#xD;
"I grieve to see you so much worse. Drink this, it may&#xD;
relieve you," she said, slipping her hand under his pillow to raise&#xD;
his head. Ida sprang forward to arrest the movement. He was&#xD;
suffering excruciating pain in his neck; and frantic at its aug-&#xD;
m~ntation by this change of position, he dashed the cup to the&#xD;
floor, with a shocking oath.&#xD;
~' You want to kill me I've seen that for a long time; and&#xD;

The smothered fire leaped igh-the dark eye blazed with&#xD;
wrath, but she uttered not a so~ind, as she turned from him. Ida&#xD;
had never seen such a look in mortal face, and~ wild with fear&#xD;
of she know not'what, darted after her, and overtook her in~the&#xD;
dressing-room.&#xD;
"Oh! do not I do not I" she exclaimed, flinging her arms&#xD;
around the stately form.&#xD;
"Do not what?" said the lady, trying to unlock her fingers.&#xD;
Ida h~hi her fast.&#xD;
"Oh! the horrible thing that is in your thoughts! He is&#xD;
mad with pain-he did not mean-did not tl ink what he did.&#xD;

"He drove me from him-struck me I" she said, in thick&#xD;
accents. "Why should I stay ?"&#xD;
It was rather a soliloquy than a question, and Ida reiterated,&#xD;
"He did not mean it! he loves you !"&#xD;
"jDo you love him ?" inquired the lady, lifting her face, and&#xD;
gazing piercingly into it.&#xD;
"I pity him," said Ida.&#xD;
"Do you hate him ?" she asked, mo&#xD;
"No, I hate no one."           re energetically.&#xD;
"Yet you have cause."&#xD;
"I try to forgive."&#xD;
"You do not hate him!" repeated Mrs. Read; and again to&#xD;
herself, 8he added, "1 do 1"&#xD;
Ida let her go. "I pity him !" she said, with mournful&#xD;
4~rnestness," but I pity you more!' doomed to a life of false-&#xD;
1~ood and misery! Heaven pity ycu as I do."&#xD;

chamber. "Do you despise me utterly? Am I lost ?"&#xD;
for repentance."&#xD;
"'Lost!' no-while life and reason last, there may be room&#xD;
Repentance! what had she, 'so queenly in her pride and beauty,&#xD;

said. "Will you come ?"&#xD;
"Not now-presently."&#xD;
The patient was slumbering heavily under the influence of the&#xD;
medicine, Dr. Ballard prescribed, when his wife rejoined her&#xD;
assistant nurse-lofty and unimpressible. . She regarded the&#xD;
sleeper long and fixedly. His hair was nearly white, and hi~&#xD;
features pinched by sickness, but there was no softening of com-&#xD;
passion in the rigid lines of her face. Setting her chair into the&#xD;
shade, she was speechless and motionless for hours. They watched&#xD;
him together all night; exchanging only brief remarks as to his&#xD;
situation, and the remedies to be employed. He rallied from&#xD;
this seizure, and Ida was as far from the brilliant worldling as&#xD;
before.              -&#xD;
An unexpected event attracted her from the retirement in&#xD;

which her charitable functions had secluded her. Celestial Pratt&#xD;
was married! and to Ellen's chagrin, to a cousin of the Morris&#xD;
family. He was good-looking, ambitious and poor.;-she ~&#xD;
ceptible. a "Representative's" daughter, and rich. He wrote to&#xD;
his aunL that they would take Richmond in the wedding-tour;&#xD;
and she was obliged, nolens volens, to give them a party. Ida&#xD;
was disinclined to attend; but Ellen's solicitations conquered&#xD;
her reluctance. Mr. Cranleigh, the groom, was gentlemanly, even&#xD;
handsome, and accepted th9 customary greetings with as much&#xD;
complacency, as though hi~ wife were not, as Ellen groaned to&#xD;
Ida-" Celestia, unmitigated Celestia !"&#xD;
"A penny for your thoughts !" said~ Ida, tapping Charley's&#xD;
arm with her fan.&#xD;
"I was thinking what falsehoods geologists tell us about the&#xD;
thickness of the crust of the earth, and how many years the&#xD;
mines of Peru have beeen worked."&#xD;
"A profound subject for deep meditation, but I am at a&#xD;
loss-"&#xD;
"Why, allowing a thousand brides a week in the civilized&#xD;
world, (and there are quadruple that number,) according to my&#xD;
rough computation, the miners ought to be within hail of the&#xD;
Chinese, or whatever nation is the antipodes of the Peruvians,&#xD;
by this time."&#xD;
"Their kindred craft, the jewellers, have been called upon by&#xD;
the Celestia-ls," said Mr. Thornton.&#xD;
"'Pon my word !" remarked Pemberton to Josephine, "I&#xD;
have heard of men who married 'for pretty,' but it's my opinion,&#xD;
Cranleigh married for ugly."&#xD;
Josephine laughed, but her attention was absorbed by some&#xD;
object in another part of the room. "You know everybody,"&#xD;
said she; "who is that gentleman talking with the bride ?"&#xD;
He 'knew everybody, and this must be nobody. He ~ad&#xD;
certainly seen him somewhere before-it might have been at&#xD;
Newport-or perhaps in New Orleans, yet he could not call ~is&#xD;
name. Why did she inquire?&#xD;
"A question by the way-she was not curious. He had a&#xD;
foreign air, and she ,might be one of Mr. Poniberton's&#xD;
friends-he had so many abroad."&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
287&#xD;
&#xD;
He had, and it would be awkward not to recollect hini, if he&#xD;
should speak.&#xD;
"There's Cranleigh! he knows I"&#xD;
The stranger's name was Ashlin, an early acquaintance of&#xD;
Mrs. Oranleigh's, and later from1 the West Indies.&#xD;
"Had he resided there long ?" Miss Read asked.&#xD;
"Two years-.nearly three, indeed."&#xD;
Mr. Ashlin was graceful and distingu~, and Ida was attacked&#xD;
by an unaccountable curiosity. She interrogated the bride.&#xD;
"What handsome man was that&#xD;
awhile ago, Celestia            , you were conversing with,&#xD;
Her face was broad with smiles. "Law! why Mr. Cranleigh,&#xD;
my husband, to be sure! Haven't you been introduced? Here!&#xD;
Mr: Cran-"&#xD;
"Oh! Ion't !" said Ida. "I know him-don't interrupt&#xD;
him! I alluded to that tall gentleman by the folding-doors."&#xD;
"That's Mr. Ashlin. He used to live close by Pa's; and&#xD;
then his uncle died out in Cuba or West India, I forget which-.&#xD;
and he went off there, where he's been three years, rolling in&#xD;
money they say. lie's mighty smart too-1'm 'most afraid of&#xD;
him. Don't he look like a-a-cannibal !" said Mrs. Cranleigh,&#xD;
some reminiscent of New Zealand history coming to her help.&#xD;
"His is a dark beauty, certainly," replied Ida, hiding a smile.&#xD;
"I should say if he had not lived abroad, that I had seen his&#xD;
face somewhere else."&#xD;
"You needn't be setting your cap !" retorted the bride, spite-&#xD;
fully. "He won't be so easy caught as that Mr. Euston, you all&#xD;
thiu~ such an Adoiphus. He's engaged."&#xD;
"Ah! who is the fortunate lady ?"&#xD;
"A Miss Courtland,-or some such name ;-that is-he was&#xD;
engaged once, but, seems to me, I've heard that he jilted her,&#xD;
and she married a rich old man for his 'tin."'&#xD;
"What did you call her? Speak lower !" said Ida.&#xD;
"Law! you're scared! what ails you?"&#xD;
"Nothing-nothing !" laughing. "You had as well be silent&#xD;
about this Mr. Ashlin,.-.-..he has quick ears, an4 gentleman do&#xD;
not admire gossiping ladies. You have a splendid bouquet-is&#xD;
this Mr. Cranleigh's taste ?" ~&#xD;

* the "Sulphur Springs" to the present glorification, was pouring&#xD;
upon her~ tympanum, she was ar ing away her unjustifiable&#xD;
* suspicions. His general appearan e was that of the gentleman&#xD;
she had a glimpse of in Mr. Rea 's parlor; and Mrs. Read's&#xD;
behaviour that evening was so extr ordinary as to give colour to&#xD;
the story ;..-But Celestia always ga bled the simplest narrations,&#xD;
murdering names and jumbling fact , until it was next to impos-&#xD;
sible to arrive at the truth. A thr. e years' absence, too! How&#xD;
nonsensical she was I Her fears returned, however, with rein-&#xD;
forcements, when he attached himself to Mrs. Read's cordon of&#xD;
admirers. These were not all young men. Elderly gentlemen,&#xD;
who had not lost the~r~ eye for fair faces, and taste for repartee,&#xD;
were recipients of a~ gracious welcomes as were apportioned to&#xD;
their youthful rivals and sagacious damsels, of doubtful belle~&#xD;
ship and ch4rms, cr~pt beneath the wings of her popularity,&#xD;
large enough to shelter a female favorite or~ so. Mr. Ashlin&#xD;
entered the outmost precincts of this circle, and by imperceptible&#xD;
advances penetrated to the centre of affraction Mrs. Read&#xD;
flushed slightly, with surprise or displeasure, as he established&#xD;
himself by her side; but nothing intimidated, he presently&#xD;
usurped the management of the conversation; holding up some&#xD;
to ridicule so cleverly that they had only themselves to blame,&#xD;
and did not suspect his agency; flattering others, until they&#xD;
dropped off like surfeited leeches; and angering some so openly,&#xD;
that 'Ida, who was near enough to get an inkling of what was&#xD;
transpiring, was assured that he was playing for a rich stake.&#xD;
His purpose was effected; he had a clear field; and with no&#xD;
alteration 'of manner, unless a shade of respect moderated his&#xD;
gay insouciance, he continued his attentions. No place is better&#xD;
for a confidential confabulation than a crowded i;oom, if the&#xD;
parties understand how to conduct it. The initiated would have&#xD;
surmised from an occasional gleam of the eye, and the varying&#xD;
expression. of that most uncontrollable of features, the mouth,&#xD;
that something more important than sugared nothings was upon&#xD;
the t~pis; but to the purblind merryma]~ers, as. a body, Mrs.&#xD;
Read ~as examining a portfolio of prints, and her companion, a&#xD;
travelled gentleman, descanting. upon "High Art" in "the&#xD;
States" as contrast~4~ with ~e' love for poetry, painting and&#xD;

music, which, it was said, prevailed in gay, pleasure..loving&#xD;
Havanna.&#xD;
Ida was, surprised that Mr. Ashlin requested &amp;amp; presentation to&#xD;
herself, and still more at the pertinacity with which he cultivated&#xD;
the acquaintance he must see she did not desire. lie triumphed&#xD;
over her prejudice, inveterate as she had thought it. His air of&#xD;
deep interest.-the admiration, too respectful to be conveyed hi&#xD;
words, which spoke in every look and* action, were dangerous&#xD;
flattery, and Ida was not invulnerable. But in reviewing the&#xD;
events of the evening, distrust obscured the pleasing recollection&#xD;
of his captivating address and the magic of his eloquence. Why&#xD;
was it bestowed upon her-a stranger, and so ~little attractive in&#xD;
her appearance? Why, especially, should he have asked per-&#xD;
mission to call? He knew Mrs. Read, and to her the applica..&#xD;
tion should, in etiquette,' have been made. There was a vague&#xD;
apprehension hanging over her~a foreboding, for which she&#xD;
could assign no cause. He called, as he had promised, "at*&#xD;
an early day." The family were collected in Mr. Read's room,&#xD;
when his card was brought to the lady of the house.&#xD;
"Mr. Ashlin," she read. "Whom did he ask for, John ?"&#xD;
, ,,&#xD;
"The ladies, ma am.&#xD;
"Very well. Josephine, I will thank you and Miss Ida to&#xD;
receive him, and excuse me."&#xD;
"Excuse me, if you please I" answered Josephine, bridling.&#xD;
"I scarcely know the gentleman, and do not covet the honour."&#xD;
"Miss Ida ?" said Mrs. Read, inquiringly.&#xD;
"Why not go down with me, ma'am? Are you indisposed ?"&#xD;
"You need not say so9..-.J am engaged. I really wish it," she&#xD;
added, for Ida was undecided.&#xD;
"Then I will go," said she, with a sensation of infinii~e relief.&#xD;
Josephine followed *her out. "Beware, . 'my h~dy-like&#xD;
Tartuffe I" hissed she, sneering in baffled malignity. "V'ou are&#xD;
mixing yourself up in a scrape which will not reflect much&#xD;
credit npon the elect."&#xD;
Her fiendish laugh was echoing after her, as Ida gained the&#xD;
parlor.&#xD;
Mr. Ashlin did not~ appear abashed or disappointed, upon&#xD;
receipt of the apologies. He bo*ed, with a civil regret, and&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7999-00000146"/>&#xD;
290&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed to forget that there were other ladies in the house or in&#xD;
the woild, than the one he was entertaining.&#xD;
Ida's disagreeable oppression returned once, at his smile, when,&#xD;
in reply to his inquiry, she stated that the portrait in the niche&#xD;
opposite him, was Mr. Read's.&#xD;
1I~ got up to inspect it. To Ida, he 'was measuring himself&#xD;
pith it, as he straightened his, Apollo figure, and expanded his&#xD;
full chest.&#xD;
"A good painting 1" he observed. "How long since it was&#xD;
taken ?"&#xD;
"Two years."&#xD;
"The pencil of time is the best test of the value of a picture&#xD;
-'-to seine it is a destroyer,-.---it beautifies others. An excellent&#xD;
piece of work !"---still scanning it. "Is the likeness correct 7"&#xD;
" Uncoi~iii~nly.-.or was, when it was painted. Mr. Read&#xD;
looks older and thinner now, that his health is impaired."&#xD;
Again that sinister smile! but he said nothing more.&#xD;
He called again, with a friend, an kabitud of the house. It&#xD;
was evening, and Mrs. Read saw them. The length of his stay&#xD;
in Richmond was indefinite ;-they were not sure but each visit&#xD;
was his last; and he, keeping up the uncertainty, came fre..&#xD;
quently, at the hours which suited him best. Josephine,&#xD;
succumbing seemingly, to the power of his ~wizard wand, freely&#xD;
declared her dread of his departure; Ida felt as much when&#xD;
with him, and revoked it, secretly, as soon as her eyes recovered&#xD;
from their dazzlement. Mrs. Read treated him, as she did her&#xD;
other visitors, and bore no part in the chorus of laudations&#xD;
haunted in his absence. When Mr. Read was well enough to&#xD;
see company, he fell an easy conquest to the arts of the inimita-&#xD;
ble stranger. "He was"-he protested, "a better doctor than&#xD;
Ballard. An hour of his society was more beneficial to him, than&#xD;
the apothecary's entire stock of drugs."&#xD;
His birth-day was near at hand, and he determined to invite&#xD;
his friends to rejoice with him, at his partial restoration to&#xD;
health. It was to be an unostentatious affair.-.--a dinner, and no&#xD;
ladies but those belonging to the family. Mr. Read was '~ as&#xD;
impatient as a child at its first tea-party.&#xD;
"They are late, Helen! their are not coming I" he said every&#xD;
few minutes, while they were awaiting the guests. He was&#xD;
&#xD;
A L ON E.&#xD;
&#xD;
working himself into a passion, when the welcome ring appeased&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Mr. Gopeland !" called the stentorian lungs of the f&amp;amp;aman;&#xD;
and Mrs. Read was as white, as if the hand of Death had smit-&#xD;
ten her.&#xD;
"How are you all ?" said Richard, in his joyous rattling&#xD;
style. "Miss Ross, I am delighted to meet you-M~s Jose..&#xD;
phine, I will not disparage your blooming cheeks by asking&#xD;
after your health,-an~d 'you, Mr. Read, have been practicing&#xD;
upon our fears, by stories of illness-hasn't he, Helen-you are&#xD;
ill !" he said, brought to a full stop by her pallor.&#xD;
"Ill! you are well-.--are you not ?" said Mr. Read, in alarm.&#xD;
Well! yes! what notions you have, Richard !" and the color&#xD;
flowed back. " When did you come in ?-down, I mean, and&#xD;
how are they at home 7"&#xD;
"'Home' is too brideish for a demure matron; but they are&#xD;
well, and* sent love. I arrived this morning, and should have&#xD;
been in before, but for business."&#xD;
"Don't leave the room, Helen. Somebody will come while&#xD;
you are out. Send John for what you want;" said Mr. Read.-&#xD;
She was slipping out tbrpugh the back parlor.&#xD;
"I will be gone but a second," she answered; and Mr. Read&#xD;
was still telling Richard how opportune his visit was when she&#xD;
returned. She was the collected, urbane hostess, only an eager&#xD;
glance at each arrival, betrayed ncrvou.suess or expectation. Mr.&#xD;
Read watched the' door, also; and his displeasure at the tardi-&#xD;
ness of his favorite was audibly vented.&#xD;
Helen!. why don't Mr. Ashlin come ?" he said, in Ida's hear-&#xD;
ing. Ears less acute would not have distinguished his wife's reply.&#xD;
"Hush! these people are jealous of your preference already.&#xD;
He will be here before long."&#xD;
Ida had mislaid her handkerchief, or not brought it into the&#xD;
room; and Richard offered to favor her retreat by a journey into&#xD;
the next room, to look at some green-house plants. Leaving him&#xD;
bending over theixi, she ran up-stairs, found the missing article,&#xD;
and was hurrying down, when a ring arrested her upon the&#xD;
lower landing. Thinking to let the visitor ~nter before her, she&#xD;
stepped back out of sight.&#xD;

~c Mr. Ashlin, I beg your pardon, sir," said John; "my&#xD;
rnistres~told me to give you this before you went into the draw~&#xD;
mg-room, sir."&#xD;
Mr. Ashlin paused-she judged, to read a note.&#xD;
"All right 1" said he. "Tell your mistress, I regret exceed-&#xD;
ingly that I am called into the country, on account of a friend's&#xD;
danger, and cannot comply with my engagement to Mr. Read&#xD;
this evening. Deliver the message as I have given it. This is&#xD;
for yourself, John. Good day."&#xD;
"Thank you, 'sir. Good afternoon."&#xD;
Ida's limbs shook beneath her. She had not time to unravel&#xD;
the mystery-for mystery she knew it to be ;-Mrs. Read's fright&#xD;
at her brother's entrance; her incoherence and exit; the strangely&#xD;
worded message; the bribe to the servant--swam in a chaotic&#xD;
medly through her mind. She was sick with terror, until warned&#xD;
to conceal her emotions 1~y Richard's sayings that "Helen's&#xD;
queer symptoms had become epidemic." Partaker of the&#xD;
alarms of guilt, by her knowledge of the sin,-averse as she&#xD;
was to participation in it~ concealment, she was possessed 'with&#xD;
the idea, that to her was coiiimitted the work of blinding Richard.&#xD;
While her ears were, alert to every sentence uttered around'&#xD;
her, and she was quaking at the least approach to a mention&#xD;
of the absentee, she aimed to monopolize Mr. Copeland's sense&#xD;
and thoughts. She anticipated their quitting the table as a&#xD;
blessed change; then a cold agony came over her, at the remem-&#xD;
brance that the gentlemen would remain. Discovery; in :this&#xD;
case, was inevitable. His wife's caution would not. ~restrain&#xD;
M.r. Read fr&amp;amp;m 'pledging 1~5i. Ashlin's health. She thought of&#xD;
bantering Richard into withdrawing with the ladies ;-.it would&#xD;
be too bold-to~ forward.' He would obey, but his respect for&#xD;
her would be finishedd ;-as a final alternative, she must&#xD;
venture it-but ~vas there no other?&#xD;
"Our patient ~Ioes us credit, Miss Ida." Her next neighbor&#xD;
was Dr.'Ballard.&#xD;
"Does yot~ credit, Doctoi'. I am only your custodian-a&#xD;
daring one, however, for I have a petition to sui~irft. Will&#xD;
it not be imprudent for Mr. Read to remain long at table, after&#xD;
the cloth is removed? His system is still inflammatory."&#xD;
Her conscience reproved her for the deception, although sli~&#xD;
&#xD;
spoke the truth, but the case was desperate. The doctor's pro-&#xD;
fessional cap was on instantly.&#xD;
"Unquestionably, my child !--unquestionably! well thought&#xD;
of; Miss Ida! We must guard against a relapse. How ~haIl&#xD;
we get him into the parlor ?" '&#xD;
Ida consulted Richard, who referred the case to Charley and&#xD;
returned her the reply, that if the ladies would delay their&#xD;
departure, a little longer than was customary,-not to startle&#xD;
those who loved to tarry at the wine, he would concert with most&#xD;
of the company to rise at the same time. Charley was at the&#xD;
helm, and Ida could safely have slept upon her watch; Mr. Read&#xD;
demurred at an infringement upon banqueting law~, 1~ut the&#xD;
seceders gallantly insisted upon attending their fair leaders; and&#xD;
the most disaffected had not courage to stand their ground.&#xD;
It was a weary, ~weary evening to Ida; she looked and felt&#xD;
wretchedly ill, after the guests dispersed. Richard looked in&#xD;
again, after saying "good night."&#xD;
"I have purchased a buggy to-day,' said lie, to Ida; "and my&#xD;
pet horse is in, town. Shall I have the pleasure of driving you&#xD;
out in the morning?"&#xD;
She assented.&#xD;
"At what hour ~" he asked.&#xD;
"I wonder what has happened; that Ashlin stayed away !"&#xD;
said Mr. Read.&#xD;
Richard started violentlyy . "Ashlin 1" he echoed with a fiery&#xD;
look at his sister. "Ashlin--.Ashlin;" he repeated, sensible of&#xD;
his imprudence. '~ I have heard the naine-who is he ?"&#xD;
"An old friend of your sister's," replied Josephine.&#xD;
Richard's face was profoundly meditative. "A small man--&#xD;
is he not? red-haired, stoops in the shoulders, and wears spec..&#xD;
tackles ?"&#xD;
Mr. Read spoke up indignantly. "A magnificent fellow! gen-&#xD;
tlemanly, intelligent, and one of the best hearts in the world."&#xD;
"I do not know him then I" said Richard, exxiphaticaliy.&#xD;
"Not I think of it, the red head's name may have been Asht0&amp;amp;.&#xD;
Say eleVen o'clock,"-to Ida-" it will be pleasantly warm&#xD;
then."&#xD;
"It will suit me," she rejoined, trembling before his gate.&#xD;
lie was punctual to the hour. Mr. Read hobbled to the door&#xD;
25*&#xD;

friendly as usual,'but he refused his sister's invitation to come&#xD;
in, and his bow, as his horse sprang off at the loosened rein, was&#xD;
to him,' They left the city by the shortest route. Beyond the&#xD;
houses~ Richard slackened their headlong speed.&#xD;
"Miss Ross !" he said; abruptly facing her, "I have classed&#xD;
you among the limited number of your sex, who are upright and&#xD;
truthful. Within twelve hours past, I have doubted &amp;amp;iou. You&#xD;
are under no personal obligations to answer my questions ;.---but&#xD;
as a brother-for the honor of my family, I demand of you, all&#xD;
that you know of this Ashlin."&#xD;
"Which is very little. I never saw him until Mr. Cranleigh's&#xD;
marriage, when~he was introduced to me at Mrs. Morris'."&#xD;
"By whom? by Helen ?"&#xD;
"By Mrs. Morris, herself He made a party call, and has&#xD;
continued to visit the house,"&#xD;
"Artful as ever I" he said, through his shut teeth. "Does&#xD;
Mrs. Rea4 s~e'him?"'&#xD;
"Yes;\ and Mr. Read."&#xD;
"The ~ld blinkard! Does Helen receive him as your friend,&#xD;
or as here 7"&#xD;
"As tl~e friend of the family."&#xD;
"Tush! I might commeiid your diplomacy, Miss Ross, if I&#xD;
were not so thoroughly in earnest. It is clear you will not&#xD;
advanc&amp;amp; a step,~ without knowing why you are questioned.&#xD;
4flaving more confidence in you, than you have in me, I will set&#xD;
you an exan~ple of candor Ashlin and my sister were betrothed&#xD;
when he was at college. We were " chums."' He is ardent-.&#xD;
~euerous in some' of his impulses, but as I perceived, even with&#xD;
my boyishly regularr notions, lax in principle. Helen was not&#xD;
iguQrant of z~iy opinion, and with a woman's faith and persever-&#xD;
axice, ~set h~r~elf to break it down.' You do not know her' as she&#xD;
was then.-high4pirited, proud and passionate, but tractable as&#xD;
a child to the voice of affection.' Her willlwas more ungovernable&#xD;
than mine, and she almost reconciled 'me to her choice. He had&#xD;
just completed his course 'at the University, when' lihe death&#xD;
of an uncle put him in possession of a valuable estate in Cuba.&#xD;
The marriage, which was to have taken place immediately, was&#xD;
po~tpoued for twelve~ months. Meantime, he was to visit his&#xD;
&#xD;
property, and prepare for a permanent residence in the West&#xD;
Indies~ The year elapsed-he did not return--and suddenly&#xD;
his letters were suspended. Helen was insanely trustful; he&#xD;
might be ill or dead-dying, or in the grave, lie was true! Her&#xD;
romantic independent disposition led her to the fcvrmation of a&#xD;
mad project-to search for him in person, since she could learn&#xD;
nothing in any other way. I could not dissuade her;-she made&#xD;
but one concession,-.that I might accompany her. The object&#xD;
and direction of our expedition was known only to ourselves.&#xD;
We were ready-a day before that fixed for starting, a letter&#xD;
came! He was enamored, of an Italian cantatrice; 'designed&#xD;
marrying her, if Helen would liberate him ;-if not, he would&#xD;
redeem his early pledge to her.' She was ill for weeks; and&#xD;
upon what, I believed was her death-bed, she extorted from me&#xD;
a vow not to revenge her. She 'should have foreseen how it&#xD;
would end,' she said, 'blind, confiding dupe, ~that she was!' She&#xD;
arose-a hardened, I think, sometimes, a heartless woman of the&#xD;
world :-with her trust in him, had perished her faith in God&#xD;
and man; an unfeminine panting for wealth and distinction&#xD;
filling its place. Chance threw this gold-fish, Read, in her net;&#xD;
and she clutched him. I had sorrowedi'or, and commiserated&#xD;
her until then; but so sordid, so wickedly, weak was this act,&#xD;
that I reproached her angrily. I said it sprang from wounded&#xD;
vanity, and a mean desire to glitter, a hollow-hearted, tinselled&#xD;
doll in the view of those who would gibe, while pretending to&#xD;
applaud ;-that her conduct was as degrading to her, as morti-&#xD;
fying to us,-and she bore my vituperations, without attempting&#xD;
to defend herself, 'Richard!' she said, when I had exhausted&#xD;
my indigr~ation, 'better reason with a tornado, than a slighted&#xD;
woman!'&#xD;
"You regard me as a chattering coxcomb, Miss Ida; but I&#xD;
solemnly declare that I could have gone to the block more&#xD;
resi~n'edly, than I saw my beautiful sister sold to her hoary&#xD;
bridegroom. These were circumstances, with which I could not&#xD;
cope-but the diabolical schemesNof this 'assassin of her peace&#xD;
shall not mature! This is'the sad tale-is it quite new to you ?"&#xD;
"In its details ;" and she related' Celestia's version.&#xD;

"I can neither deny nor assert, Mr.. Copeland. I have&#xD;
imagined many dreadful things, which may have no real exist-&#xD;
ence. You may judge for yourself.'&#xD;
His brow was lighter, when he had heard her unvarnished&#xD;
relation.&#xD;
"I thank you I" said he, heartily. "We may cicatrize this&#xD;
wound yet. I will see Helen to-night; she expects a reproof;&#xD;
and if she is not what she appears,-refined steel-I will make&#xD;
her feel. I dare not meet Ashlin-but I will write--and if&#xD;
he crosses my path again-." He resumed in a milder tone.&#xD;
"I would crave one more proof of your good-will, but that I fear&#xD;
a refusal."&#xD;
"Ask it."&#xD;
"If he renews is visits, will you inform me&#xD;
"No, sir! said da, positively. "The service savors too much&#xD;
of espionage."&#xD;
"I was afraid you would see it in that light. Miss Read," he&#xD;
continued, scornfully, "would require no persuasion to play the&#xD;
spy. I wa~ near committing myself last night. His name was a&#xD;
galvanic ~hock."&#xD;
"I cannot~ but hope," said Ida, "that our fears have mag~&#xD;
nified shadows into~ spectres. We are so prone to shape events&#xD;
'after the fashion of our inclinations or forebodings. Do not&#xD;
consider it an impertinent liberty, Mr. Copeland, if I recom~&#xD;
mend to you to be very gentle in your, reprehension of your&#xD;
sister. Callous, self-dependent in semblance, think what. her&#xD;
sufferings are, empaled by memory and conscience. Oh! if we&#xD;
had more charity for the tempted I"&#xD;
~,Temptation, sin, suffering! how naturally the words succeed&#xD;
each other !" mused Richard.&#xD;
"And they are an epitome of all human woe," said Ida.&#xD;

"It is a doctrine of mine, tlu~t a small proportion of the great&#xD;
aggregate of crime is committed from actual love of sin."&#xD;
She was gratified at his demeanor toWards his sister upon&#xD;
their return. He dined with them, and was markedly attentive&#xD;
to her, combining so much brotherly kindness with a certain&#xD;
deference' to her wishes ~and sentiments, that she struggled with&#xD;
the softness which menaced her proud composure. As they&#xD;
quitted the table, he passed his arm around her waist, and there&#xD;
were tears in the eyes upraised to his. No more auspicious&#xD;
time could occur for the contemplated conversation; and Ida&#xD;
enticed Mr. Read into his reading room, by the lure of an uncut&#xD;
periodical. The words fell from her mouth mechanically-her&#xD;
mind was upon the momentous interview. In the character&#xD;
and life delineated by Richard, she traced, with a thrill, a&#xD;
similarity to her own; the impetuous temper-unmanageable,&#xD;
save when the breath of love sighed over the heart; the blasted&#xD;
hope; the unworthiness of the object of adoration-ah! this&#xD;
bitterest ingredient in the cup of despair was spared her! but&#xD;
the prostration of soul and body; then the heaven-threatening&#xD;
billows of blasphemous misanthropy, and self-abandonment-the&#xD;
parallel was just here-to diverge how widely in the result of&#xD;
the ordeal! one, wilfully completing the ruin of her happiness&#xD;
by perjury-cauterizing her heart with corrodents, that eat&#xD;
away its fevered Pife; the other, dragging herself, wounded and&#xD;
weary, to the feet of the Good Physician, to be .healed, and fed,&#xD;
and sustained by His loving mercy; and the language of [da's&#xD;
thanksgiving was, "Lord I Thou hast made me to differ I"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE season of sunshine and roses had come, and. Carry'&#xD;
demands for her friend's society were importunate.&#xD;
"You would not fret your dear heart with h~~owing doubts&#xD;
of my love for you and Poplar-grove, if you could peep in upon&#xD;
rue this .morning," wrote Ida. "Mr. Read is worse. I am&#xD;
unfamiliar with, the diagnosis of this malady; but I fear hi~&#xD;
condition is very precarious. He is entirely disabled; cannot&#xD;
lift his hand to his mouth without extreme pain, and his nervous&#xD;
system is much deranged. I write now at the window farthest&#xD;
distant from his bed, and cautiously, that the scratching of my&#xD;
I p~n may not disturb him. I can see your hands* and eyes go&#xD;
I up, and hear the 'this is too much!' which signals the last&#xD;
throe of expiring patience as you picture me a nun-like figure,&#xD;
with serge gown and close cap; or more affecting, an attenuated&#xD;
damsel, such as we see upon tomb-stones, pressing a handkerchief&#xD;
to one eye; I imagine your multitudinous arguments, each un-&#xD;
answerable in its excellence, and which I know by heart. You&#xD;
allege that he is not entitled to my cares, inasmuch as there&#xD;
are no ties of blood between us; that he has never done me an&#xD;
ungrudged ~'avor; that he is gi~ee~y and thankless for my&#xD;
services; that his wife - and daugl4er should esteem it their&#xD;
duty and pleasure to tend him; a d llfthly and lastly, that&#xD;
it is wrong to endanger my health, as your whimsical country&#xD;
doctors will have it I am doing. Putting the last first,-&#xD;
reassure yourself my dear-I am well. I do not prevaricate to&#xD;
allay your fears; I look well, eat well, and sleep well, and I~&#xD;
may dismiss the remainder of your objections in one sentence-.&#xD;
I am doing my duty, Carry! I am morally certain of this,&#xD;
more certain, than if you were my charge; for my love would&#xD;
be the mainspring of action then. I am upheld by the assur-&#xD;
ance, that I am fulfilling, in my humble way, the command, our&#xD;
Saviour appointed as th. touchstone of piety to the end of&#xD;
time-' Do good to them that hate you, pray for. them that&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
despitefully use you.' I thank Him that lie has vouchsafed&#xD;
to me this opportunity to examine myself by this criterion."&#xD;
The sufferer moaned, and she laid down her pen. %' You have&#xD;
had a refreshing sleep, have you not, sir ?"&#xD;
"No! there is no ease for me. Why is that window open&#xD;
It does seem that you all have conspired that I shall die&#xD;
whether or no. Where is Helen ?"&#xD;
"She was here awhile ago, and will he in again soon."&#xD;
c~ Is she in the house ?"&#xD;
"I do not know, sir. Let me get what you want."&#xD;
"I want ker I"&#xD;
She was not at home, and Ida renewed her offer.&#xD;
"Gone out, hey !" he rambled on, peevishly. "How she&#xD;
walks! as if the ground were not good enough for her feet I&#xD;
ogling and coquetting! and I am here /" with an oath. "Where&#xD;
is Josephine ?"&#xD;
"Down stairs, sir."&#xD;
"What is she about ?"&#xD;
"Anna Talbot is with her."&#xD;
More folly and vanity! ringlets and ribbons, and bonnets&#xD;
and beaux! The world is peopled with knaves and fools.-~&#xD;
women are knaves-4men %~ools. You are a mixture."&#xD;
Ida suppressed a smile. "Your lips are dry," she said "li~re&#xD;
is water."&#xD;
He drank it. "You are !'~' he went on, obstinately, "I hated&#xD;
you from the minute you entered this house, and you repaid me&#xD;
with compound interest. Here you are, sitting. up at night;&#xD;
waiting on me all day. I can't do without you, because you&#xD;
are handy and wakeful, but I don't like you. Do you hear ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"I. don't! and therefore, I'm a fool to tolerate the sight of&#xD;
you. I'm a fool-that's proved! You are spoiling your eyes&#xD;
and complexion, and losing the time you might be catching a&#xD;
husband-.mewed up here. You expect to be paid when my&#xD;
will is read-that's knavery-hypocritical knavery. I haven't&#xD;
~ft you a red cent; you are a fool to think of it, and that's&#xD;
proved 1"&#xD;
Pitiful driveller! It was nofr insensibility, but- compassion,&#xD;
that closed Ida's mouth, although she knew this was the revela~&#xD;

custom and policy was rent in twain.&#xD;
"What time is it ?"&#xD;
"Twelve o'clock, sir."&#xD;
"That's a lie I it's three, at least! Bring~ the watch to me.&#xD;
It has stopped! Hold it 'to my ear-you've put it back! Lay&#xD;
it down by me! I don't trust you again !"&#xD;
The hands pointed to one~when Mrs. Read appeared.&#xD;
"Well, madam !" the form of each tooth was seen through&#xD;
the thin'lips, stretched over them like yellow parchment. "And&#xD;
where have you been traipsing ?"&#xD;
"I walked down the street."&#xD;
"' And on Main street, too, I'll swear! spending more money&#xD;
than you'd sell for. at auction! Why don't you answer me?&#xD;
Your tongue was more glib when you were passing compliments&#xD;
with that fellow who walked with you."&#xD;
." I went out alone, and did not go on Main street."&#xD;
"You would have been better emplo~red in the kitchen-&#xD;
forever gadding! I don't want you in here-I'm sick of you nd&#xD;
your brazen face !"&#xD;
"What error to suppose that sickness softens, and predisp ses&#xD;
tne heart to repentance !" thought Ida. She went into the&#xD;
other room, and beckoned Mrs. Read. "The doctor was ere&#xD;
this morning," she said; "and told me, privately, not to md&#xD;
his irritability, nor to answer him, unless silence increase it.&#xD;
It is an ordinary symptom in neuralgic affections. We mus~ be&#xD;
forbearing."&#xD;
"There is a limit to everything," was Mrs. Reads respo4se.&#xD;
"True-but forbearance should last as long as' the pain ~we&#xD;
would cure."&#xD;
"That is your theory, Miss Ida. I am tired of the practice.&#xD;
You mean well, I have no doubt, but I am not a fit object for&#xD;
your charity."&#xD;
The asperity was pointed at herself, rather than at her hearer,&#xD;
and Ida pondered upon her words and manner, often during'&#xD;
the day.&#xD;
It did not .agree with" Josephine "to sit up"-a constitu~&#xD;
tional weakness, loudly lamented, and encouraged, instead of&#xD;
overcome. Ida and Mrs. Read divided the vigil; the mulatto&#xD;
&#xD;

nurse, Sarah, sleeping in the apartment. Ida ~as to watch the&#xD;
latter part of the night The patient was cross and restless,&#xD;
when she looked in upon~him at bed-time--railing, and swearing&#xD;
and abusive.&#xD;
"You want me dead ~" he said to his wife; "but I won't&#xD;
die-to spite you. I shall live years, and years, and years, 'till&#xD;
you are a toothless hag, and walk with a crutch! Ha! ha I"&#xD;
"He is delirious !" whispered Ida. "Let me stay with you !"&#xD;
"He is not! I prefer your retiring. Sarah will call you at&#xD;
two."&#xD;
"I shall not undress, to-night, Rachel," said Ida. "I have&#xD;
a presentiment I shall be wanted."&#xD;
"Is he much woise.?"&#xD;
"No-but I may be called up. I shall sleep here, upon the&#xD;
lounge."&#xD;
But sleep was coy to her wooing. If she bad ever felt fear,&#xD;
she would have known that she was scared and excited. The&#xD;
south wind generally affected her unpleasantly, creating heat&#xD;
and nervousness; but to-night the breeze was from the north,&#xD;
and the moonbeams were spread in broad, white sheets upon&#xD;
the floor. "I must be sick 1" she said, aloud. "I cannot ascribe&#xD;
~this numb horror to anyI~hing else. They have a superstition&#xD;
that it is a precursor of death." Her mind rejected this expla~&#xD;
nation, but the utterance of that word had populated her soul&#xD;
with phantoms. Lynn's chill, damp hands again enfolded hers;&#xD;
and his glazed, upward look-still and fixed, moved not at her&#xD;
weeping; the clods rattled upon the coffin-frozen clods! and how&#xD;
warmly sever the ~sun smiled upon t.he swelling turf-~--downwhero&#xD;
he 'slept, it was frosty night still! Must be, the loved and gifted,&#xD;
rest there forever? would a tender mother's arms never more&#xD;
embrace her,-the dear lips, now turned to dust, never cling to&#xD;
hers, in speechless fondness? But the dead should rise! some to&#xD;
the resurrection of the just, some to everlasting shame and con~&#xD;
tempt. Oh! the unspeakable woe of a hopeless death! t'he dying&#xD;
strife c~f the finally impenitent! Was his end approaching? "My&#xD;
God! avert from him this doom !" His room was beneath hers.&#xD;
She could hear occasionally a groan, which she knew was an&#xD;
execration. He might be dying. She thrust her feet into a&#xD;
pair .of melted slippers, and descended to his door.'~ "Quiet-&#xD;

~everely, to herself. "I need repose and steadiness of nerve-&#xD;
there are watchers with him." But she would not go back to&#xD;
her room. She went, instead, to the parlor. The hall..lanip&#xD;
burned all night; and setting open a door, and enclosing a&#xD;
shutter, to dissipate the darkness, which suffocated her, as a&#xD;
thick p~ll, she stretched herself upon a sofa. She slumbered&#xD;
a~d~dr~wed-visions, like her waking fancies. She was in Mr.&#xD;
Read's chamber; writing to C~rry, at her far window ;-~--the&#xD;
door swung back, and bis wife glided in. With a gesture of&#xD;
s~lence~to her, she passed to his bedside, and poised a knife above&#xD;
his heart! Ida strove to scream-to move-but her mighty&#xD;
efforts only shifted the scene-did not awaken her. He was&#xD;
dead~; and his friends had come to the funeral. They thronged&#xD;
the room where his corpse lay in its costly coffin; and the&#xD;
carriages, headed by the hearse, grated upon the pebbled gutter.&#xD;
~he undertaker was tightening the silver screws-when, oh I&#xD;
horror!. the lid was heaved up from within-crashing and&#xD;
splintering-.-..and the dead sat upright I The distorted features&#xD;

Reads. "I will not die I" She was in the centre of the apart-&#xD;
ment~; the cold beads dripping from her forehead, and her hair,&#xD;
dank and heavy, upon her face and neck. She put it back, and&#xD;
listened. The silence drove by her in waves-throbbed with&#xD;
the the beatings of her heart. Hark I it was not all a dream!&#xD;
the pawing of hoofs rang upon 1~he stones. The moon had set;&#xD;
and the lamp was brighter than the starlight. She had the&#xD;
presence of mind to creep to that side of the window hidden by&#xD;
the shutter,. and looked out. A carriage was at the door-in&#xD;
appearance like the doctor's. He had been summoned-the&#xD;
sick man was worse. Something light and white sailed past her&#xD;
window, from overhead; as it fluttered to the ground, a tall&#xD;
figure stepped from the vehicle, and caught it to his bosom.&#xD;
The apparition of the Arch-Fiend himself would not have&#xD;
shaken Ida, as did that manly form. She was awake! A&#xD;
stealing step fell, softly as a snow-flake, upon the floor above-~&#xD;
she. heard it. With the speed of light, she flew to the front&#xD;
door---locked it-to that at the other extremity ~of the passage&#xD;
~-hid both keys beneath the cushion of the h~Jl.sofa, and back&#xD;

again to the street entrance, as Mrs. Read, dressed for travelling,&#xD;
had her foot upon the lowest stair. The fugitive leaned against&#xD;
the wall for support, faint with the terrors of detected guilt.&#xD;
"Back 1" said Ida-her cheek bloodless-he eyes flashing liv-&#xD;
ing fire. "False to your word! false to your sex I 1 will save&#xD;
you from public disgrace! Back! I say !~'&#xD;
"Not while I live 1" was the answer.&#xD;
"And you cross this threshold over my body I" cried the girl,&#xD;
passionately. "Oh! shame I shame! you-the pride and, idol&#xD;
of your family and your husband! that you should break their&#xD;
hearts and disgrace his name I"&#xD;
"It is not my name after I leave this-I shall forget and be&#xD;
forgotten. Let me go I"&#xD;
"Forget! forgotten! you may! a false woman can forget the&#xD;
mother who reared her! but the stain upon them! your tears,&#xD;
nor his blood can cleanse it I"&#xD;
"You are mad I" said Mrs. Read, regaining her composure.&#xD;
"You cannot stop me. My home is in another land. Why&#xD;
do you talk of disgrace? the brutal dotard I fly from, will unfas~&#xD;
ten my legal fetters, and then I shall live! the life for which&#xD;
my Creator destined me I"&#xD;
"You speak your Creator's name! trampling upon His laws&#xD;
'-His curse hanging over you I Oh I I entreat you, by a.&#xD;
mother's prayers-for the sake of your old father, tottering&#xD;
upon the verge of the grave-in the name of your honorable&#xD;

not--you cannot go; the doors are locked-call for assistance&#xD;
from those who are without, and I will alarm the household.&#xD;
To-morrow your name will be trumpeted at the corner of every~&#xD;
street. Ha!. that cry! they have discovered all! Too- late!&#xD;

threw them into a corner, as Sarah rushed down the steps.&#xD;
* "Mistress! Miss Ida! for the Lord's sake, come! Master is&#xD;
dying!"&#xD;
A cry from Josephine~pierced their ears. Ida forgot her&#xD;
companion, but she reached the chamber with her. Writhing,&#xD;
convulsed, screaming, he was wrestling with the Destroyer;&#xD;
the disease had grappled his heart. Mrs. Read sank upon her&#xD;
knees, as blasted by a thunderbolt; Josephine shrieked in help.&#xD;

He was down ~tairs while she was speaking. "Why, Miss&#xD;
Ida, the key is no~ here I"&#xD;
She ran for it, I unlocked the door, and pushed him out. A&#xD;
man stood in the shade of the porch, whom John did not per-&#xD;
ceive, in his rapid egress; but he seized Ida's hand, as she would&#xD;
have shut him out.&#xD;
"Helen I"&#xD;

"Good heavens 1"&#xD;
The bolt ~had shot into its' place, ere he coul~. say more.&#xD;
All the accompaniments of the last agony, of~which Ida had&#xD;
ever heard, read or conceived, were realized in this struggle ;-&#xD;
the blackening features, drenched with sweat, the starting eye,&#xD;
the twitching muscles, the death-rattle,~th~ soul was tearing&#xD;
through the clay receptacle: yet for two hours the awful conflict&#xD;
was pmtracted.&#xD;

countenance, telling in death, of suffering; and there were solemn&#xD;
stepping and stifled whispers through the house; and crape&#xD;
waved from the door, where the traitorous frkncl, had waited, at&#xD;
night, for the dead man's wife.&#xD;
Mrs. Read was borne to her chamber in hysteric convul-&#xD;
lions, and continued raving and swooning all day-attacking,&#xD;
in tigress fury, every one who approached her, excepting Ida.&#xD;
Her she would not suffer to quit 4er sight. Jilolding her&#xD;
hands in a frantic grasp, she poured orth such tales as made&#xD;
her heart ache i of warm Spring eve~in~, when the air was&#xD;
laden with sweet-briar scent, and the young moon was swimming&#xD;
in the pale blue sky, and the star of love shone upon them-.&#xD;
an eye of light-from the blushing west, and 'he sung tQ&#xD;
her~-poetry ascending from his heart as perfume from the&#xD;
flowers-songs, upon whose memory she lived; in the winter of&#xD;

was a yawning abyss, like the abode of the lost, from which&#xD;
arose hot, poisonous simoons and tormenting. spirits. The world&#xD;
brought incense and gaudy offerings, and friends their best trea-&#xD;
sures, but it closed not-and she resolved, by self-immolation,&#xD;
to shut' the chasm; by an irrevocable sacrifice, to seal it forever.&#xD;
The effort was idle-she sold~ soul and body for nought. lie&#xD;
came, and turned her face to the Future. His heart had&#xD;
wavered, but returned to its allegiance. She Was his, by an&#xD;
earlier, holier tie than her loathed tyrant'8 ;-away in the sunny&#xD;
land of their youthful dreams, they would live, unmolested by&#xD;
memory or care. She clung to duty, until her husband drove&#xD;
her from him with a curse; to a brother's love,-and he painted&#xD;
that brother's hatred of~him, and threatened to see her no&#xD;
more ;-~-and by ~rQie specious names of "soul-dictate;" and&#xD;
the "religion wkich enjoins truth, and condemns hypocrisy,"&#xD;
gained her promise. The hand of the Almighty interfered!&#xD;
Ida shut up her tears, and reasoned and plead with her;&#xD;
praying inwardly for her comfort, and that her own mind and&#xD;
nerves might not fail her. She rested the maniac's head upon&#xD;
her breast-bathed the beating temples, and pressed her cool&#xD;
lips to the parched ones, working with pain-beseeching her,&#xD;
with every endearing epithet, to rest and forget. But the lava&#xD;
crust was heaving; and the long-repressed flood spread over&#xD;
it in fast, seething streams. ~L'he June twilight was on the&#xD;
earth-as she had described those of years agone; and in calming&#xD;
tones, she bade Ida "sing."&#xD;
"What shall I sing ?."&#xD;
"Of love and faith and hope.&#xD;
The exhausted girl rallied her strength, and the sweetest of&#xD;
written hymns seemed whispered to her spirit.&#xD;

will be too much for your parents. Some of your friends ought&#xD;
to be with you."&#xD;
"But not Richard! any one else 1"&#xD;
Ida was perplexed. He would insist upon seeing her, as&#xD;
soon as he heard that she was awake ;-they must meet in the&#xD;
morning, and the shock then might unfit her to endure the&#xD;
trials of the day; yet to tell her now, appeared cruel and.&#xD;
unnecessary&#xD;
"You have not eaten to-day-you will take some nourishment&#xD;
if I bring it ?"&#xD;
Don't leave me 1"&#xD;
"Only for a little while. Promise me to be good and quiet,&#xD;
until I can run down stairs and back."&#xD;
"Only do not stay-I am afraid to be alone."&#xD;
Richard was pacing the hail with a troubled air. "How is&#xD;
she ?" he asked.&#xD;
"More composed."&#xD;
"May I go up?"&#xD;
"It pains me to deny you; but she can see no one, at pre~&#xD;
sent."&#xD;
"This is extraordinary, Miss Ida. We know that there is not&#xD;
ground for this excessive grief, and Helen has not miss-ish&#xD;
nerves. What ails her ?"&#xD;
His frown commanded her to reply, explicitly~&#xD;
"You do not reflect how sudden Mr. Read's death, was, Mr~&#xD;
Copeland. It was an alarming event to ~us all. After awhile,&#xD;
your sister will receive you. She does not know that ~ou are&#xD;
here ;.-her mind has wandered all day; and I deemed it safest&#xD;
not to agitate her. Trust me to do all in my power for her and&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"I do 1"&#xD;
Mrs. Read remained comparatively tranquil, saying little,&#xD;
except to supplicate Ida not to leave herr&#xD;
"You are better-'-are you not ?" haquired the latter, stroking&#xD;
her brow.&#xD;
"Yes.-easier, and more quict."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7999-00000155"/>&#xD;
~1OS                   ALONE.&#xD;
"I find your brother has been sent for;" sho pursued&#xD;
"lie has come 1" ejaculated Mrs. Read. "Oh! what shall&#xD;
I do? what shall I do ?"&#xD;
"It is unavoidable ;-you must meet-why delay it ?"&#xD;
"Oh! he will kill him! he said he would, if he ever spoke&#xD;
to, me again !"&#xD;
More pek'plexity! Ida staggered under it. Her ingenuousness&#xD;
pointed to the straightest, as the best road. The guilty mind&#xD;
would never be unburdened without confession; but there was&#xD;
sohd rock, underlying the foamy flow of Richard's character.&#xD;
When his distrust of Ashlin did not amount to a defined con-.&#xD;
viction, he had said, that be "dared not see him".-and she&#xD;
recalled his meaning,.-." If he crosses my path again 1" The&#xD;
dilemma was fearful-a life of concealment to one, murder ~o&#xD;
the other. Mrs. Read's consternation redoubled on perceiving&#xD;
hers. '"What shall I do? oh! if I could die I" she m9aned,&#xD;
tossing from side to side. Ida spoke in accents of command&#xD;
~.~representing the* unhappiness she would experience i~i her&#xD;
intercourse with. her deceived' brother; the watchfulness~ and&#xD;
subterfuges, and the misery of acCepting a love she ha4 for-&#xD;
feited; and on the other hand, the remorse of the murderess;&#xD;
the blood of another soul clogging hers; the public ignom1tiy~&#xD;
bu~ this was barely touche4 upon.&#xD;
Yet sin unconfessed 'to man, is not always unrepented of to&#xD;
;" said she.&#xD;
"~Can you resign this base-hearted man, and devote your life&#xD;
to aii endeavor t&amp;amp; repair.-.-ou cannot of yourself, expiate your&#xD;
offences against youi~ ~Maker and your fellow creatures ?" And&#xD;
the haughty, hardenedwoman bent before the simple majesty&#xD;
of truth and feeling, and solemnly vowed herself ready for her&#xD;
work:&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       309&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
RICHARD was to take his sister home; and Ida was busily&#xD;
assisting her to pack her trunks, the day after the funeral, when.&#xD;
Josephine 'sent to request an audience. She ordered the ser~&#xD;
vants out of the room as she came in, and without preamble,&#xD;
entered upon her subject.&#xD;
"You two have been confederates in many amusing schemes.&#xD;
Wedded spirits at sight, you flattered yourselves that you coun~&#xD;
.terfei~ed indifference successfully. But not ~to me-my fair&#xD;
intriguers! , You, Miss Ross, were wilfully imprudent. I foiled.&#xD;
your manoeuvrT~5 to entrap Morton Lacy, the man you loved ;-'&#xD;
you owe the disappointment, from which you. will n~ver recover,.&#xD;
to me. You were unwary to oppose me a second time. And&#xD;
for you-lovely and inconsolable widow ~ your downfall was&#xD;
decreed from the moment we met. I poisoned that old man's&#xD;
mind against you. He weakly tried to repel doubt--to confide&#xD;
-the fool I in your love-but the venom was subtle-certain'r&#xD;
1 overheard your first interview with your recreant lover-&#xD;
marked, step by step, your reconciliation, and furthered it when&#xD;
I could :-1 saw your trepidation when your brother's arrival&#xD;
menaced an expos; and compelled John afterwards to a cone&#xD;
fession of the warning he transmitted, and the reply, 'on&#xD;
account of a friend's danger I' T~iat 'friend' is in imminent&#xD;
danger now I The cessation of his visifs did' not mislead her,&#xD;
who dogged you in your walks, and saw him by your side. 1&#xD;
was awake the elopement night,-saw your signal, and heard&#xD;
'the theatrical dialogue in the hall, rehearsed for the benefit&#xD;
of eaves-droppers, to clear the skirts of your accomplice, when&#xD;
your flight should be discovered. PahI a child could see through&#xD;
it I a remarkable coincidence that Miss Ross should select a par.&#xD;
br for a dormitory, and arouse, just in season to confront you at&#xD;
the door! It was a scene,-as the play-bills have it-' for tne&#xD;
night only.' Your plan proved abortive; death has kft 'you as,&#xD;
free as a divorce would' have done; and when the 'days of&#xD;
mourning are ended,' you think to marry, and the public be in&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7999-00000156"/>&#xD;
ALoNE.&#xD;
blissful ignorance that this measure was in contemplation before.&#xD;
your husband's decease. Idiot! is this the revenge I have&#xD;
worked for? Your swain is yet in town ;-act out your plot.&#xD;
You need not go to Cuba-the laws of Virginia do not forbid&#xD;
the bans. If, however, your saint-like confidante reprobates&#xD;
'indecent haste,' my game is nevertheless sure. I give you to-&#xD;
day and to-night for deliberation and escape. At the end of&#xD;
twenty-four hours, if you are in this house, your hot-blooded&#xD;
brother shall hear the interesting, facts, of which I have pre-&#xD;
sented a summary;-.I have spoken, and I never repent I"&#xD;
Her audjtors had not moved hand or foot, since she began to&#xD;
speak; and after she had gone, they gazed at each other in the&#xD;
same dead silence. Mrs. Read's stony despair revived Ida's&#xD;
energ~es.&#xD;
"I am lost I" she said, in a hollow tone. She put by the&#xD;
garment she held, and seated herself, with folded arms.&#xD;
are not I"&#xD;
"She 'never repents!"'&#xD;
"God grant she may, before it is too late !" said Ida, looking&#xD;
ance. We must consider. Bear 1'p, and remember your vow !"&#xD;
upward; "but I do not rely upon er relenting for your deliver-&#xD;
But her own heart sank. Contrivance and expedient presented&#xD;
themselves,-..all inadequate to the emergency.&#xD;
"Are you willing to brave Richard's wrath, if it affects only&#xD;
yourself ?" she asked.&#xD;
"I am! to the shedding of my blood. Your face brightens!&#xD;
Is there any hope 7"&#xD;
"Iniquity defeats itself I" said Ida devoutly. "The Helper&#xD;
of the tempted will provide a ~neans of escape. Have we not&#xD;
time, and~ the knowledge that be is in the city, and liberty to&#xD;
communicate with him? Write him a warning, and a. ~fina1&#xD;
farewell;-l~e must fly for his 'life-he will do it! The traitor&#xD;
is seldom brave 1" she said inwardly.&#xD;
Mrs. Reed's nerveless fingers dropped the pen.&#xD;
"I cannot !"&#xD;
0 You must I" said Ida, authoritatively. "His life.-your&#xD;
peace, depend. upon it. Write! I will dictate."&#xD;
The note was short 'and iinpeiative. If the hand quivered,&#xD;
the heart that indicted 'did :not.              -&#xD;
&#xD;
811&#xD;
&#xD;
"Take comfort 1" said Ida, sealing it.&#xD;
"How will you send it ?" said Mrs. Read, whom grief and&#xD;
shame had robbed of mind and fortitude.&#xD;
"I will carry'it myself."&#xD;
"Oh I not you! what will be said?"&#xD;
"Trust me. If Josephine has emissaries, so have I. I will&#xD;
not c9mpromise myself or you. I was cut out for a conspirator,&#xD;
and to keep up the chara44er, you must disguise me~ My&#xD;
appearance 'on the street so soon after the-~yesterda~, will&#xD;
excite remark. AM this thk~k veil, and that black mantle,&#xD;
will serve my purpose. Now, whuld you know me 7"&#xD;
"Never-but dear Ida-"&#xD;
But repeating. "Take comfort I" Ida kissed her, and went&#xD;
out. She tripped across the back yard, under shelter of the&#xD;
buildings, unlatched the gate, and was safely in an alley, bisect-&#xD;
ing the square, and parallel with the street upon which the&#xD;
house was built. She walked briskly, thinking over her plan.&#xD;
As in Lynn's case, Charley was her aim; but she was not so&#xD;
sure now of his co-operation~ It was' a delicate and dangerous&#xD;
matter '-would he be a blind tool? confidence was not to be&#xD;
thought of. With his nice notions of propriety, would he take&#xD;
a note from her to Mr. Ashlin, of whose ~haracter she had beard&#xD;
him speak disparagingly. "This is foolish 1" she interrupted&#xD;
herself-" he must I" and she was conscious that this wQrd&#xD;
from her carried with it an authority few had the hardihood to&#xD;
resist.&#xD;
John Dana was in the store, but he did not know her, and&#xD;
sent a clerk forward.&#xD;
"" IL wish to see Mr. Dana, sir."&#xD;
She raised her veil as he responded to. the call.&#xD;
"Ida! my dear child! I should never have recognized you I"&#xD;
"I did not design you should. My errand is with Charley-&#xD;
is he in?"&#xD;
"In the counting-room. What is the matter 7"&#xD;
"With me'? Nothing, sir ;-a state secret. He is my Vizier."&#xD;
"Very well I" said he, smiling. "' Walk this way.'~ ,He&#xD;
pushed aside the baize door, and Ida thought she should faiiat~,&#xD;
as Richard Copeland was discovered talking with Oharley. JQhn&#xD;
also retreated.&#xD;

"He i~ not alone;" he said, "I will call him out."&#xD;
"Not while Mr. Copeland is here 1" she faltered. "Oh! I&#xD;
would not have him see me I"&#xD;
"Ida !"&#xD;
"He must not see me, Mr~ Dana 1"&#xD;
"Then I will hide you-shall I ?" He took her to the end of&#xD;
a counter, piled to the ceiling with goods; gave her a tall stool,&#xD;
and bade her "rest awhile."&#xD;
Ida was ashamed of her perturbation, and heartsick of the&#xD;
feints and concealment her nature revolted at ;~all the conse.&#xD;
quences of another's errors.&#xD;
Charley and Richard entered thb store. "You had better&#xD;
say you will go," said the latter. "It is insufferably stupid ;-&#xD;
8taying here this weather."&#xD;
"I don't know whether I can get off;" answered Charley.&#xD;
"We'll see."&#xD;
His brother directed him to Ida. He was astonished to see&#xD;
&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"But you can never be unwelcome."&#xD;
"Cela depend;" said Ida, "I sue for a favor."&#xD;
"Consider it granted."&#xD;
"That will not do. Can you perform my bidding, without&#xD;
asking questions ?"&#xD;
"I am not inquisitive; and I depend  upon your discretion."&#xD;
"Then,' will you deliver this letter immediately ?"&#xD;
His countenance changed. Ida lifted her finger.&#xD;
"I have promised," he replied; "but Ida~-if you were my&#xD;
sister, I would not be the bearer of this !"&#xD;
"Charley I"&#xD;
C(I do not s~y it to hurt your feelings, but I know men, and&#xD;
this man, better than you do. This is not your handwriting.&#xD;
My fear is that you may be tampered with-not your integrity-..&#xD;
but that designing people may impose upon you credulity."&#xD;
"I thank you sincerely for your consideration , but I act with&#xD;
my eyes open, and conscientiously believe I demand&#xD;
necessary.' I dictated that note. Will you oblig~&#xD;
Unhesitatingly."&#xD;
"Be sure you give it7 at once, to him. I cannot explain.&#xD;

Ai~ONE.&#xD;

&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
I may never do it, perhaps. One thing more. Where does&#xD;
Mr. Copeland want you to go? and when ?"&#xD;
"To the country, to-morrow; a tete-d-tete drive out of town;&#xD;
a dinner at a tavern; and spend the day in the woods, gunning."&#xD;
"Go, please I I have a special reason for asking-itj---.and&#xD;
start early."&#xD;
"More mysteries I"&#xD;
"The last I shall ever annoy you with, Charley."&#xD;
"Enough! if possible you shall be obeyed. I trust you, Ida-.&#xD;
not one of the other parties concerned. By the way," he added,&#xD;
putting on his hat, "Lacy passed through the city yesterday;&#xD;
stopped but an hour, and left his regrets and respects for you.&#xD;
lie would have called, but for the circumstances of the family."&#xD;
"I should have been happy to see him," said Ida, very natu-&#xD;
rally. "Was his .sister with him? how is her health ?"&#xD;
"Not improved. They contemplate a sea-voyage. I heard&#xD;
a queer report about him the other day." They were at the&#xD;
store-door, and Ida did not lower her veil, although the light was&#xD;
glaring. Charley was scrutinising her from the corners of his&#xD;
eyes, and she was aware of it.&#xD;
"I don't credit it ~" he said. "They say he is engaged to be&#xD;
married to Miss Arnold."&#xD;
Ida smiled. "Why do you discredit it ?"&#xD;
"Why 'I hear the girl is a flirt; she is pretty, but I don't&#xD;
relish the match. Besides, to be frank, I had a private opinion&#xD;
that-"&#xD;
"That he was engaged to me 1" finished Ida, laughingly.&#xD;
"Your shrewdness is at fault for once, Charley. I have known&#xD;
of his engagement ever since last summer-almost a year."&#xD;
"How did you hear of it ?"&#xD;
"From himself."&#xD;
"All right then, I suppose ;" Charley reluctantly conceded.&#xD;
"I'll be hanged if I don't believe it's all wrong I" he muttered,&#xD;
as he walked down the street. Ida did not, mutter. or sigl~i, on&#xD;
her way home. She cheered Mrs. Read's drooping spirits by&#xD;
reporting their case in excellent hands, and the happy Providence&#xD;
which appeared likely to befall them in Richard's projected&#xD;
jaunt. "A day is as precious to us, at this juncture, as if. its&#xD;
minutes were diamonds," said she.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7999-00000158"/>&#xD;
314        ALONE.                               ALONE.         815&#xD;
&#xD;
Withdrawing to her chamber, she wept long and sadly. "If&#xD;
I could only have seen him for one hour! one minute! Oh! I&#xD;
shall never be free-never forget! Can I censure poor Helen,&#xD;
when I am mself so weak? for it is sin to love him, the pro-&#xD;
mised husband of another !"&#xD;
An hour-and she was with h ~r dejected charge, busy and&#xD;
cheerful-yet so thoughtful, so sy~npathetic, that the repentant&#xD;
wanderer, blessed her as a heave~iy messenger of compassion&#xD;
and goodness&#xD;
Ida was dressing in the m&#xD;
from Charley.             morning, when she received a note&#xD;
"Mr. A'-.- decamped yesterday afternoon, servants and&#xD;
baggage-it is said not to revisit these parts shortly. I do not&#xD;
know whether 'this much discussed Hegira is, in any way, attri-&#xD;
butable to your billet, but write, in the supposition, that the fact&#xD;
may not be uninteresting. Mr. C- and myself are on the&#xD;
point of starting upon our 4de ;-return to-night.&#xD;
In haste, yours,&#xD;
CHARLEY."&#xD;
Ida smiled scornfully. "The caitiff! I said the false were&#xD;
seldom brave I"&#xD;
She' setit the note to Mrs. Read. Rachel brought up an&#xD;
answer. "You are my guardian angel," it s&amp;amp;id. "The God&#xD;
you love and serve, may reward you-I never can. I shall&#xD;
spend this day alone. Richard must hear the truth, and I&#xD;
should be his informant---not that miserable girl, who would&#xD;
gloat\upon the sight of his grief and amazement. I shall write&#xD;
him everything. Pray for me&#xD;
To~ards evening, Rachel, as the only trustworthy bearer, was&#xD;
dispatched to Richard's hotel with 'the letter. Mrs. Read had&#xD;
expended her moral courage in the execution of this mortifying&#xD;
duty. She p'~assed a wretched night-a prey to agoni4ng anti~.&#xD;
cipattons-imagining Mr. Ashlin's return; his being overtaken;&#xD;
the death of one or both; Richard's desertion of her, or that her&#xD;
family would disown her. Ida stayed with her, but her ~ondo-&#xD;
lences and sanguine predictions were futile..&#xD;
"You do not know Richard !" was Mrs. Read'8 inva~iablo&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
He appeared at the hour for departure, and without coming in,&#xD;
sent to inquire if she was ready. Id&amp;amp; supported the half-swoon-&#xD;
ing woman' down stairs. Richard was in the porch. He saluted&#xD;
her slightly-his sister, not at all;-his face so gloomy and&#xD;
stern, Ida dared not~ accost him. Josephine was less timorous,&#xD;
or had a stronger incentive. She walked boldly to the door.&#xD;
"Mr. Copeland, can ~you spare me a minute of your valuable&#xD;
time? I have a word to ~ay to you."&#xD;
He wheeled upon her with a withering sneer. "I am admona&#xD;
ished of the purport of your communication, Miss Read, and my&#xD;
regret is only second to yours, that the indulgence of your ami-&#xD;
able penchant for bloodshed is inevitably postponed by the flight&#xD;
of our chivalrous friend. I give you credit fQr having acted in&#xD;
perfect consonance with the finest feelings of your soul. Permit&#xD;
me to express the hope that the 'consummation we mutually&#xD;
desire, is not very remote-that the "transgressor may be&#xD;
rewarded according to his works ;"-and while this is the burden&#xD;
of your prayers, I would have you remember that I shall put up&#xD;
a like petition with regard to yourself I"&#xD;
Mrs. Read strained Ida to her breast silently, and the hot tears&#xD;
fell fast upon her cheek. She tendered her hand to Josephine.&#xD;
It was disdainfully rejected.&#xD;
"Farewell, Mr. Copeland ;" said Ida, holding out her hand.&#xD;
He clasped it, and inclined his head, as in adoration. "It is&#xD;
'well," he said, in an under tone, "that IL have met you. You&#xD;
have preserved me from total abnegation *of female truth.&#xD;
Thank heaven that you have' but a physical resemblance to your&#xD;
sex 1" He closed the carriage-door upon his weeping sister,&#xD;
mounted his horse, bowed to his saddle-bow to the wave of Ida's&#xD;
handkerchief, and galloped off.&#xD;
Anna Talbot was to stay with Josephine until the necessary&#xD;
'legal formalities should leave her free to select a home; and&#xD;
Mrs. Dana claimed Ida. She needed rest and nursing. This&#xD;
week of agitation and wearing fatigue, was the fore~nner of a&#xD;
fever, which might have resulted fatally, 'had she i~etained her&#xD;
old quarters. There was nothing at Mr. Dana's to quicken&#xD;
memory into action upon unpleasant subjects; n~ darkened&#xD;
chambers, or everbur~ing tapers; no hurrying from room to&#xD;
room, with the '~uppresscd bustle, that indicated a renewal of&#xD;

the patient's sufferings. These were sights. and sounds painfully&#xD;
familiar to her of late. She lay in an airy apartment; the light&#xD;
tempered, not excluded; with books and flowers, and if she&#xD;
wished, the happy children to amuse her; and when she started&#xD;
from sleep, with a groan or shriek sounding through her head,&#xD;
her eye fell. upon the placid face of her hostess, smiling tenderly&#xD;
to dispel her alarms; or Elle's cherry mouth said, in the flute-&#xD;
like accents, so like her aunt's, "You're just dreaming, cousin&#xD;
Ida !" ~ She left her bed, but her tottering steps would n~t bear&#xD;
her far; and John Dana carried her in his strong arms every&#xD;
evening to the parlor, where was Charley, disposing, with the&#xD;
skill of an accomplished nurse, the pillows that heaped her sofa.&#xD;
She was thankful for the debility that made her the recipient of&#xD;
these tokens of true affection. They loved her; sh~ no more&#xD;
doubted this, than she questioned her attachment to them. One&#xD;
day~she appeared thoughtful~ and Mrs. Dana remarked upon it&#xD;
in private to her coadjutors. She was afraid it arose from some&#xD;
1 saddening reminiscence, or mistrust of the future; "Charley&#xD;
must enliven her." And Charley, if he did not bring mirth,&#xD;
eliminated the caged trouble.&#xD;
She "had heard," she said, "that the law required her to&#xD;
choose a guardian."&#xD;
"True ;" said tJharley.&#xD;
"Is there any specified time? has it expired 7"&#xD;
"A month hence will do; although Miss IRead has made . her&#xD;
choice."&#xD;
"Ah! whom ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Talbot, the elder. Easy soul! he has not a thought of&#xD;
the pickle he is in.&#xD;
Ida was more serious. "Will you say* the same of my&#xD;
selected protector."&#xD;
"Probably-you being a fav-simile of her."&#xD;
"May I choose-whom I please ?"&#xD;
"Undoubtedly."&#xD;
"Will it~be a very troublesome office 7"&#xD;
"Hum-in-mI I should say not. Some care-some respond.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
IT was chinquapin season ~ and a grove of "bushes" on the&#xD;
outskirts of the Poplar-grov~ plantation resounded with the&#xD;
jocund voices of a nutting party. The green beards rolled back&#xD;
their white lips, in a smile, sa~ring as plainly 'as smile could say,&#xD;
for the shining .brown treasures-" Come and take us I" . As a&#xD;
loaded upper limb was roughly shaken,, and screams of laughter&#xD;
and pretended fright arose from the group, upon whose heads the&#xD;
hurtling shower descended, our friend Charley might be seen,&#xD;
sauntering away, in suspicious unconcern ;-Ellen Morris was&#xD;
weaving h~r gay-coloured meshes around Mr. Euston's susceptible&#xD;
heart, and Mary Truman, with Charley, as aid, was' pioneer to a&#xD;
dozen children of assorted sizes. One couple had strayed to the&#xD;
edge of the grove, where, from the brow of a hill, they over-&#xD;
looked a wide expa se of landscape. The lady, whose bloom was&#xD;
heightened by exer ise, or some other cause, was profoundly&#xD;
occupied in. sifting chinquapens-taken, a handful at a time,&#xD;
fro~n her basket-in o the same again. Her cavalier was speak-&#xD;
in~ low and impress ely&#xD;
~' You cannot argue indifference from my delay. I was ready&#xD;
fQr this declaration a year ago; but you were not; and while I&#xD;
left you in no doubt as to my intentions, I wished you to have&#xD;
ample time and opportunity for making up your mind. I have&#xD;
not the vanity to hope ~to allure by personal attractions or showy&#xD;
qualities; but if the disinterested love of a manly heart ~an wiu&#xD;
your regard, I may trust that my offering will not be scorned;&#xD;
I visited you last winter, and saw that you' were not happily&#xD;
situated. A more hasty lover would have spoken then :-I would&#xD;
not have your discontent with one home, influence your decision&#xD;
in nly offer of another-would not have you self-deceived; for&#xD;
your happiness is dearer to me than mine. But now, that you&#xD;
are translated to a sphere, in which you are appreciated and&#xD;
beloved, your. will is untrtunmelled by the restrictions of a stern&#xD;
guardian.~~.-.free to move, without the goad of desire to escape a&#xD;

rous and honourable. His persevering attachment, was guaranty&#xD;
of its depth. Pleasant as her life was now, the death of her&#xD;
guardian, or his widower-hood.---(she thought of such chances, in&#xD;
these days of death and change-) would cast her out upon the&#xD;
world-alone and homeless as before. She~had ,all the woman's&#xD;
longing to be paramount in one heart,~the sun and attraction&#xD;
of a home. She  ~ould give her suitor but a sisterly regard, at&#xD;
present; but she had been told that this culminated in a calm&#xD;
affection, askingg through life-mighty in death. The passionate&#xD;
idolatry of earlier days was conquered by religion ;-she believed&#xD;
that it had subsided into friendship ;- its hopelessness, impelled&#xD;
her to forget it-how more effectually than in another love? Her,&#xD;
colour fled, as it ever did, before powerful emotion, and the&#xD;
fingers, while they went on, burying themselves in the glossy&#xD;
brown heap, were icy cold. She must reply-she looked up-&#xD;
not in the intelligent face-handsome in its pure fervor of devo-&#xD;
tion-but beyond-.---to where the blue sweep of the hills lay,&#xD;
graceful and light, against the rosy horizon; and she gazed, until&#xD;
her dark eyes were dilated and moveless, and her companion,&#xD;
strur~k by their expression, looked to the same spot. He saw&#xD;
but the hills, an~ . the heavens, spanning them in crimson&#xD;
glory-she verily t~iought, as she stood, rooted to the earth, in&#xD;
the dumb agony of memory, and recoiling at the fate, her tongue&#xD;
had almost sealed,-that she beheld-as if the folds of that&#xD;
glowing canopy wei~e drawn aside-the form and 'features of her&#xD;
first-what she knew now, was to be her: only love !-.-that look.&#xD;
ing back, from whatever height in life, she should see the&#xD;
remembered lineaments distinct, unaltered, stamped upon that&#xD;
part of the Past he had made radiant.&#xD;
"Ida! do you never mean to marry ?" inquired. Charley, that&#xD;
night.&#xD;
"You gentleman say every girl will as. soon as she has a good&#xD;
offer;" was ~'the rejoinder.&#xD;
"Gerinaine is not an 'eligible' then ?"&#xD;
"'Who said anything about him ?"&#xD;
"I did. I am~ unable, by any system of ratiocination with&#xD;
which I am acquainted, to establish why a sensible, fancy-free&#xD;

lady should refuse a man, who is unexceptionable in morals,&#xD;
behaviour, education, appearance and prospects."&#xD;
"What an array of recommendations! what evidence have&#xD;
you that I have committed this~egregious folly ?"&#xD;
"Your 'tjuibblings--if nothing else. Deign to enlighten me&#xD;
as to motive-the act being granted. Why did you discard him ?"&#xD;
"Because I did not love him, Charley."'&#xD;
"Tha~ is to the point! now---why didn't you love him?'&#xD;
"Beca~use I could not."&#xD;
"Not ~o good. Why couldn't you ?"&#xD;
"Impertinent! is love made to order? As with a soda fount,&#xD;
hiwe you but to twist a screw in the heart, and it bubbles up for&#xD;
any 'unexceptionable,' who prays for it in a flowery speech ?"&#xD;
"Jumping the question again! What is your ideal husband&#xD;
like?"&#xD;
"He mu~t be my master !" said Ida. "Mr. Germaine is kind&#xD;
and excellent-intelligent and gentlemanly; but my will would&#xD;
never yield to his. He would say-.' Shall I?' and 'will you?'&#xD;
in matters w~iere his interests, no less than mine, were involved.&#xD;
My ideal say~s, gently, but decidedly-'I think'-.-.'I will?'"&#xD;
"So our friend may ascribe his ill-success to his lack of Blue-&#xD;
Beardishness! Oh, woman! thy name is caprice !"&#xD;
Ida had scanty faith in the reality of his wonder,' but most.&#xD;
of that expressed was genuine. "Such a fine young man! well-&#xD;
to-do in 'the world, and she so unprotected !"~ Carry had built&#xD;
many castles in the air, upon Ida's presupposed acceptance of&#xD;
her neighbor, and expostulated with her.&#xD;
"Better a lonely, than a miserable life, dear Carry ;" was&#xD;
the reply. "I have my Bible to direct me,-my Heavenly&#xD;
Father to lean upon. While I obey Him, He will not leave&#xD;
me friendless. As to the obloquy of old-maidism, I do not&#xD;
dread itt"&#xD;
At the fall of the leaf, the town Danas returned home, and&#xD;
Ida slipped into her place in the family, as though she had&#xD;
always constituted a part of it. The time winged happily and&#xD;
uneventfully along until Christmas. Dr. Carleton, Arthur and&#xD;
Carry were with theni' then, and another visitor, Ida's name~&#xD;
eake~ and the miraculous prodigy of Poplar-grove ;.-a lovely&#xD;
babe, four months old; with its father's hazel eyes, and the&#xD;

A L ON E.&#xD;
&#xD;
091&#xD;
&#xD;
transparent skin, and bright flossy curls of its beautiful&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
On New Year's eve, the older members of both families cob&#xD;
elected in the parlor, to greet the commencement of the new&#xD;
cycle. Ida occupied an ottoman, between her guardian' and~&#xD;
Charley; chatting, 'with girlish vivacity, to the 'latter. Mrs.&#xD;
Dana was in the opposite corner, in the shadow of the mantel,&#xD;
conversing with her father* but her voice shook at times, and&#xD;
her eyes wandered constantly to, her young friend. Ida did not&#xD;
notice this, nor the sadness that tinged her guardian's fatherly&#xD;
look, as he smoothed her chestnut hair for a long time, musingly.&#xD;
She did not suspect lie was thinking of her. He smiled, as she&#xD;
threw up her eyes to his face, and rested her head against the&#xD;
arm of his chair; but it was a fleeting light.-the uncertain&#xD;
enjoyment of a pleasure; whose loss one anticipates. Finally he&#xD;
he spoke.&#xD;
"Ida! will you give your attention for a minute ?"&#xD;
"For an hour, if you wish it, sir. I am all ear.'&#xD;
"You must be mouth, too-for there are questions for you to&#xD;
answer. Yesterday, in examining certain papers of Mr. Read's,&#xD;
pertaining to the guardianship, ]1 found a packet of letters,&#xD;
mostly from your mother-some from Mr. Grant, and one of&#xD;
yours-written after your illness at Sunnybank. You say&#xD;
therein, that it was your mother's wish for you to take, her&#xD;
place, as mistress of the establishmenI~ there,, so soon, as in his&#xD;
judgment, 'you should be possessed of the ability; that' there&#xD;
were plans laid off, but unfinished by her, whose completion she&#xD;
bequeathed to you ;-and you enclose a schedule, which sur-'&#xD;
prised me by the sound sense and foresight displayed in its&#xD;
provisions and items. You conclude by declaring yoor'prepos-&#xD;
sessions for a country life, and the binding character of the duty,&#xD;
which you conceived was 'resting upon you. I referred to your&#xD;
mother's letters. It Is not for us to censure the dead, but it is&#xD;
amazing how Mr. Read could have slighted the desire, virtually&#xD;
conveyed in every one of them, viz.: that it sWould be optional&#xD;
with you, at what time after you had attained he age of eighteen,&#xD;
and remained single, you should return to a h~Qme, to which, she&#xD;
was assured conscience and affection would alike attract you.&#xD;
She describes your strength of mind and purpose, when a child,&#xD;

&#xD;
as remarkable; and says that she would not fear to entrust to&#xD;
you, the execution of any directions concerning the business she&#xD;
then superintended. My course is too plainly laid down for me&#xD;
to deliberate or waver. In a year, you will be of age; your&#xD;
judgment i~ as r~p~ now, as it will be then; you are competent&#xD;
to control yourself, and your subordinates. It is for you to say&#xD;
whether you still considerr it obligatory upon you, to anticipate&#xD;
your legal majority."&#xD;
There was a blank silence. Mrs. Dana alone, was not sur-&#xD;
prised, and she had most pending upon the verdict. Ida hid&#xD;
her face upon her guardian's arm.&#xD;
"I would not trouble you needlessly, dear child ;" he said,&#xD;
passing his hand over her dark locks; "else I would tell you&#xD;
how dear you were to us, before you lived with us ;-how doubly&#xD;
dear you are now. If personal feeling were the arbiter in this&#xD;
case, I would never have made the statement you have heard to-&#xD;
night; and Jenny ~has not spoken, because foreseeing that her&#xD;
affection might outrun her discretion, I exacted a promise ot&#xD;
non-interference. Your home is here, dear Ida, as long as you&#xD;
choose to make us happy by your presence. I repeat-the deci-&#xD;
sion rests with you."&#xD;
"I do not know what to say. Determine for me, dear Mr.&#xD;
Dana."&#xD;
"I may not, my child."&#xD;
"Carry! Charley! what ought I to do ?"&#xD;
Charley shook his head; but Carry was not so prudent. "Oh!&#xD;
Ida! your going will break sister's heart; a year cannot make&#xD;
much difference."&#xD;
"If it is my duty at all, it is now, as much as then-is it&#xD;
not ?" asked Ida, of Charley.&#xD;
"I am afraid s~ ;" said he, seriously..&#xD;
"Charley I how can you 1" exclaimed Carry. "One would&#xD;
think you were willing to lose her! You are young, Ida-there&#xD;
is no necessity for burying yourself alive, yet."&#xD;
"Have a care, Carry! John is right---she must decide ;" cau-~&#xD;
tioned Arthur.&#xD;
"One question, Ida," said Charley, kindly. "You have&#xD;
revolved this issue often in your mind, even since you have been&#xD;
with us-have you not ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes.".&#xD;
"~You said, a year ago, you felt bound to fulfil your mother's&#xD;
wishes, and that your inclinations leaned the eameway.-howis&#xD;
it now? There is the case in a nut-shell.&#xD;
"One hard to crack, nevertheless ;" said Ida, with glistening&#xD;
eyes. "I love Sunnybank, and I have had misgivings that the&#xD;
indulgence I meet here, may spoil me for the active, self-denying&#xD;
life I must lead ;-for I have always looked forward to a resi-&#xD;
dence there, some time or other ;-but I am so happy here.&#xD;
Still, Mr. Dana, I have a vast deal of surplus energy which ought&#xD;
to be employed. I am not working with all my might. Does&#xD;
this sound ungrateful ?"&#xD;
"Not. a bit of it 1" struck in Charley's assuring tones. "It&#xD;
is not that you love C~esar less, but Rome more.~~&#xD;
"But it is so far !" objected Carry,-" and so out-of-the-way.&#xD;
Suppose you fall sick! 0, brother John! it is heartless to&#xD;
send her off by herself !"&#xD;
"She shall not go by herself, Carry. If she concludes to&#xD;
leave us, it must not be before Spring; then Jenny and I will&#xD;
go with her. If she is convinced, upon trial, that she is inade-&#xD;
quate to the enterprise, or dislikes it, we shall be too glad to&#xD;
have her back. Grant is a respectable man, and an intelligent&#xD;
farmer; and she must secure a companion. You mentioned his&#xD;
sister-in-law, I think, Ida ?"&#xD;
"As to the distance," said Charley, "If those snail-like&#xD;
fellows continue the railroad, as they say they will- it will pass&#xD;
within six miles of Sunnybank."&#xD;
This was a ray of comfort; yet Mrs. Dana burst into tears,&#xD;
and Carry threw her arms around Ida, sobbing bitterly, as she&#xD;
"feared she ought to go."&#xD;
"Carry! Jenny! you must not!" said Charley. "She has&#xD;
done her duty-and should be encouraged. You are borrowing&#xD;
trouble upon interest. Who can tell what may happen before&#xD;
Spring?~ An earthquake, or the end of the world may stamp&#xD;
'Finis' upon sublunary things, and you'll be ashamed of your-&#xD;
selves for having anticipated evil."&#xD;
He succeeded in calling up a smile, and Carry unintentionally&#xD;
effected a further diversion. "Oh, Ida !" she sighed. "If&#xD;
you had married Mr. Germaine !"&#xD;
&#xD;

824'                   ALONE.&#xD;
"I am happier as it is, Carry."&#xD;
"I move a' postponement of the subject, sine die ;" said&#xD;
Charley. "We must welcome in the year with a song. Come&#xD;
to ~he piano, Carry. Ida, Arthur-come! we want a quartette."&#xD;
They kai~ned to speak of the coming separation with compo-&#xD;
sure; but its shadow was upon all 'hearts, longer and blacker as&#xD;
the .time drew nearer. Ida sometimes debated with herself&#xD;
whether she could be called to seyer a relationship which had&#xD;
taken such hold of her inmost soul. She was not supine or&#xD;
useless; 'for the love a Christian's virtues gain; is indirectly&#xD;
leading men to the Saviour; ~nd every day she could animate&#xD;
'some drooping spirit, or alleviate some woe, were it only a&#xD;
child's. Yet she was not performing labors commensurate with&#xD;
her talents and energies; she was upon the circumference of the&#xD;
wheel ;-Nature designed her for t1~e centre and motive power.&#xD;
There was a satisfaction in havin~ the ~matter settled. She&#xD;
had not the courage to introduce it herself; but her guardian's&#xD;
straight-tbrward summing-up and appeal had convinced her, and&#xD;
the rest of his hearers. A scheme, so' uncommon, had opposes&#xD;
and despisei~s in abundance. Some honestly lamented her&#xD;
departure; and many more insinuated at "family disagree-&#xD;
ments" and "high-spirited young ladies." She was "Quixotic"&#xD;
and "masculine,"' said others, boldly; and there were benevolent&#xD;
friends who thought it a pity so much eloquence should be&#xD;
wasted and carried faithful reports to the cause of the commo-&#xD;
tion. Among the busiest in promulgating scandal, was Jose-&#xD;
phine Read, until she was taught caution by a scathing rebuke&#xD;
from Charley, inflicted publicly, 'in respouise to a sneer, not&#xD;
meant for his ears; and of the opposite party, Ellen Morris&#xD;
unol~trusive grief affected Ida sadly. They seldom spoke of&#xD;
Lynn; b~it there was a tacit understanding that his memory&#xD;
was the bond of their intimacy. Outwardly, Ellen was the&#xD;
same-only Ida knew that the spontaneity of her gaiety was no&#xD;
more, and, that the most brilliant jets were 'forced up by a&#xD;
pressure, that would have, destroyed the spring of most hearts.&#xD;
On the second anuiversar~ of Lynn's death, she came tcf~~ite&#xD;
Ida to a wa.lk-showing a bouquet of spring flowers concealed&#xD;
in her veil. Divining their destination, Ida turned their steps,&#xD;
of 'her own accord, to the cemetery. The spring was forward;&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.         825&#xD;
&#xD;
so it had been the year he died; but its youiag blosson~ s were&#xD;
killed by the frost .nd snow which should have 'beloi~ged to&#xD;
winter--and he perished with them! The turf was green; the&#xD;
evergreen rose; creeping over the headstone, was full of glossy&#xD;
leaves and the violets upon his breast were budding. The girls&#xD;
knelt on either side of the grave; trimmed away the dead twigs&#xD;
of the rose, plucked the sere leaves of the violet, and clipped the&#xD;
ragged grass-talking softly, as over a sleeping babe. Besides&#xD;
themselves, there were no visitors in the grounds; and having&#xD;
deposited their offering upon the mound, they eat down. Ellen's&#xD;
arm was encircling Ida's waist, while one of the latter's rested&#xD;
on the grave.&#xD;
* '"I may not do that," said Ellen, mournfully. "Although&#xD;
when it rains or snows at night, I weep to think how it beats&#xD;
upon him, and pine to shelter him with my arms,.-when I am&#xD;
here-.-and I come often, Ida-secretly! I see him dead-perhaps&#xD;
murdered by me-and I no more dare embrace that clay, as you&#xD;
are doing, than the murderer would touch the body of his&#xD;
victim, lest it should bleed afresh."&#xD;
"This is morbid regret, Ellen. I was his sister and confidante.&#xD;
You had nothing to do with his death; if you had never parted,&#xD;
the disease might have assailed him. The blight upon your heart&#xD;
is deadly enough, without increasing it by unm9rited self.re-&#xD;
proach. Everything is so calm and sweet here, this afternoon,&#xD;
and I have' such a consoling surety that he is happy! The&#xD;
spirits of the loved return to earth-are hovering about us-.&#xD;
present, although unseen. He may be with us."&#xD;
"'Do they love there still?'" said Ellen.&#xD;
"They do-with a love 'purged from selfishness and doubt-&#xD;
ings-perfect--.-- pure!. Oh! Ellen! the bliss and holiness of&#xD;
Heaven ! ~why do we' love this' World~ so well ?"&#xD;
"They are loveless alike to me; I have no hope or rest in&#xD;
either. When he was here, I loved this earth, because he was&#xD;
upon it; ita 'charm has gone-and can I thank, or revere Him&#xD;
who bereaved me ?" -&#xD;
"My dear girl I .He~smites to heal. In my short life, I have&#xD;
studied His providence sufficientlyy to teach me that it is the&#xD;
wise Physician, as well as the Father, who takes away our&#xD;
hurtful delights, arjkl rives our hearts. He waits now, Ellen,&#xD;

to infuse life-IIis life, into your fainting soul-to wind these&#xD;
severed cords about His loving heart. This patient, boundless&#xD;
love was our Lynn's dying hope; and you will never be com&#xD;
forted until you accept it."&#xD;
"It is~ easy to talk 1" said Ellen, fretfully. "You cannot&#xD;
understand a sorrow like mine."&#xD;
"The heart knoweth its own bitterness, Ellen, and my life&#xD;
has not been all stinshine. There are griefs, piercing and drying&#xD;
up the spirit-never revealed to man."&#xD;
"I know that. Is not my soul shrouded in. sackcloth drinking&#xD;
wormwood and gall-when my body is bedizened in its finest&#xD;
array, and the sparkling wine reflecting the lying bloom, that&#xD;
says I am glad and gay I I envied you your mourning cfress as.&#xD;
king as you wore it; and when he was named by the hypocrites&#xD;
who fawned upon him in life, I had to seem as unconcerned as&#xD;
they; you 'had no need to stifle your sighs, for he was your&#xD;
friend. I had denied him as my lover, while we were betrothed;&#xD;
I cannot publish it now. There is but one restraint upon my&#xD;
despair. If, as, you say, the spirits of beloved~ ones are with us,&#xD;
and he is among the blest, ~he must be grieved,--if they can&#xD;
grieve-that I contemn the Being he loves."&#xD;
"Ellen! this language is evidence that your chastisem~it is&#xD;
not wanton injustice. Whether he hears you or you ieve&#xD;
and insult your Maker by your mad words, the S*aviour, to ~hom&#xD;
you are.' indebted for being and comforts and friends-who~ has&#xD;
loved you from the beginning. You knelt 'to a creature He~ had&#xD;
made; He interposed the gate ~f death, to save you from the~fate&#xD;
of the idolater, and you ask to spend your life in bewailing tour&#xD;
affliction-in showing your adoration of perishable dust, hand&#xD;
reviling your best Friend! Is this your gratitude ?"&#xD;
Ellen did not speak. Ida drew her closer. "My dearest&#xD;
girl I" she said, "I do not reprove you in my own name. I&#xD;
h~ve been as guilty as yourself; and it is in remembrance of.&#xD;
the retribu~on which followed, I warn you-'--in remembrance of&#xD;
the 'love that forgave me, ai~id bestowed peace and joy, in place&#xD;
of disquiet and mourning, tl~at 'I entreat you-come to Jesus 1"&#xD;
"I cannot! your pleadings are Water upon a rock. I have&#xD;
been thinking, as you w~ere ~peaking, whether, I cared to go to&#xD;
Heaven-and I paii~ted it, gloriously beautiful, as holy men tell&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.            82T&#xD;
&#xD;
us it is-but without the love, my foolish vanity tempted me to&#xD;
sport with, when it was mine-for which I would imperil my.&#xD;
soul now-and the Creator of that heaven, and its angels, and&#xD;
fair sights and music were delightless. Rather misery with&#xD;
him~, than every other joy without. Oh! if he had known&#xD;
how I loved him !"&#xD;
Her head fell upon the tomb, and the tears rai~ied upon the&#xD;
turf. Ida wept, too-but in pity. Ellen was, perverse in her&#xD;
hopeless sorrow-her friend could only commit her to the tender&#xD;
mercy 8he had besought her to seek.&#xD;
"If you knew how Our Father loves you both, dear Ellen I"&#xD;
she whispered, but there was ~no reply.&#xD;
It was a trial to say farewell to that grave. She had visited&#xD;
it ere the sods joined over it; planted flowers there, and watered&#xD;
them' with tears; had sat there at sunset, and watched the&#xD;
"long, bright pomp" he used to love; had learned there lessons&#xD;
of contentment and charity, and active usefulness, "'while the&#xD;
day lasted." Next to pne other green heap, where the willow&#xD;
shadows were dancing, this was the dearest spot on earth t&amp;amp;&#xD;
her. She seemed brought so near to Lynn by the sightof it;&#xD;
and as she had kissed his white brow in death, she pressed her&#xD;
lips to the marble, with a murmur of regretful fondness-&#xD;
"Brother !"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
JOHN DANA, his wife and little ones, attended Ida to Sunny.&#xD;
bank. They arrived late at night, tired and sleepy; but their&#xD;
sunrise matins were paroled by Ida, as she sang a lively hymn&#xD;
in the breakfast-room, under the guest-chamber, She roamed&#xD;
briskly to and fro, rummaging side-boards and peeping into&#xD;
closets.&#xD;
"Jest like you used. to do, Miss Ida I" said Aunt Judy. "Law&#xD;
me! this comes of faith. I callers said I should live to deliver&#xD;
up them keys into your hands. And you've come home for&#xD;
good, honey ?"&#xD;
~" Yes, Aunt Judy-come to stay with, and take care of you.&#xD;
That's 'for good,' isn't it ?"&#xD;
"To be sure! It's a mighty 'sponsib~lity, honey !"&#xD;
"She'll have strength given her to bear it 1" said Will, behind&#xD;
her. It's time your biscuits' were baking, Aunt Judy, and&#xD;
you're talking about responsibilityy 1"&#xD;
"I shall depend upon you, Uncle Will," said Ida. "The&#xD;
servants were easily controlled while mother's influence was at&#xD;
work. How they will submit to one of my age and experience&#xD;
remains to be seen.&#xD;
"Mr. Grant. keeps them tolerably straight, ma'am. I can't&#xD;
say it's exactly as 'twas in her time, but they'll break in pretty&#xD;
easy, I reckon. An overseer, no matter how smart and good,&#xD;
aint a master or mistis. We get our victuals and clothes, and&#xD;
look just the same, but there's nobody to ride down from 'the&#xD;
house,' after planting, and hoeing, and harvesting's done, and&#xD;
say, well done, boys 1'- and at night, when we, whose quarters&#xD;
are in the yard, come u~, it's so dark and lonesome, and still,&#xD;
and the doors and windows all shut, it makes us low-spiritect---.&#xD;
like 'twas no use to work-and Sunday-we feel it tl&amp;amp;ei&amp;amp; 1"&#xD;
"So you are rather glad I am back again ?"&#xD;
"Glad! inistis! I couldn't be more pleased if you was 'my own&#xD;
child I We need you, ma'am; we need you 1"&#xD;
*" Still, as Aunt Judy says, it's a great responsibility."&#xD;

ALO N1~.                       320&#xD;
*    "You're one of the Lord's lambs, mistis. He will provide."&#xD;
He went out, and Ida ~aught up his last words, and through&#xD;
the dark nooks and reverberating galleries, of the old house,&#xD;
* sounded the refrain-&#xD;
"'His call we obey, like Abram of old,&#xD;
Not knowing our way, but faith makes us bold,&#xD;
For 'though we are strangers, we have a good guide,&#xD;
And trust in all dangers, the Lord will provide!"'&#xD;
She met her guests with a kiss, and a jingle of the key-&#xD;
basket, and seating them at table, poured out the coffee; refuting&#xD;
Mr. Dana's objection that his was too sweet, by the Irish lady's&#xD;
answer to a similar complaint from General Washington-&#xD;
"Shure, and if. 'twas all sugar, wouldn'tt 'be too good for yer&#xD;
Honor I"-piled the children's plates with buttered cakes-&#xD;
rattling all the while of her dignities, poss~sions and. "'sponsi-&#xD;
bility." After landing a clean grass plat for the children's play-&#xD;
ground, she challenged Mrs. Dana to a stroll. over the house&#xD;
and garden. It was an old-fashioned family mansion, rambling&#xD;
and picturesque; some rooms wainscotted to the ceiling, and&#xD;
lighted by rows of narrow windows, with surprisingly small&#xD;
* panes. These were chambers: the lower story, the parlour,&#xD;
dining-room, and the apartments appropriate(1 to her m~t1ier and&#xD;
herself, were light, large, and finished in a more modern style.&#xD;
Mrs. Dana preferred the antique. The massive furniture suited&#xD;
them so well, and it was interesting to think of tl~ generations&#xD;
they had known-what stories they would relate if the panelled&#xD;
oak could speak.&#xD;
"With a little variation, they would tell one of all," replied&#xD;
Ida~ "They were born, suffered, joyed and died 1" And she&#xD;
thought how she had gone through all, except the last, within&#xD;
these walls. The garden was ploughed up. ~fhere was no&#xD;
comeliness in it, but it was less desolate than when overgrown&#xD;

"The soil is fertile," said Mr. Grant. "We shall have vege-&#xD;
tables  vorth showing this summer, Miss Ida. Mr. Dana sends'&#xD;
his respects, and will you step into the parlour? we would like&#xD;
to consult you."&#xD;
Ida composed her face into a Malvoli~ expression of solemnity&#xD;
and conceit; pompously apologized to Mrs. Dana, and obeyed.&#xD;

But the account~ books wer~ shut, and her guardian was luxu-&#xD;
riating in an arm-chair and a' cigar.&#xD;
"Mr. Grant and myself have been investigating and comparing&#xD;
accounts, Ida," he said; "and the result is highly creditable&#xD;
to him and those in his service. Without wearying you with&#xD;
particulars, I have set down the sums total here. You perceive&#xD;
that the crops have met the expenditures of the plantation; and&#xD;
each year, the nett profits have surpassed those of the preceding&#xD;
-a proof that your land is constantly improving. This, as I&#xD;
said, is to be attributed to Mr. Grant's judicious -management.&#xD;
Your servants are well fed and clothed, and the doctor's bill&#xD;
* trifling in its amount. Praise is also due to M . Read. I&#xD;
approve entirely of the investments be has made of the funds,&#xD;
left after the necessary disbursements for expenses. Your&#xD;
money is safe and not idle. You were fortunate in your stew-'&#xD;
ards, and assume the control of an unencumbered estate, under&#xD;
most favorable auspices."&#xD;
"I am indeed 'grateful to Proyidence, an~l to them, sir. It&#xD;
is not my wish; however, to release you from your guardianship.&#xD;
I cannot do it nominally, as yet, and after the law shall permit&#xD;
it, I shall - still rely upon you for direction. A woman is not&#xD;
fi~~ted to be a financier. It is a trespass upon your time and&#xD;
goodness, but I cannot endure that yo~i should give me up."&#xD;
"Nor I, n~y child. You will neve~ ask advice or ~assistance&#xD;
* from me in vain. If your measure$ are ill-advised, I shall&#xD;
oppose 'them, and forward your interest by~every means in my&#xD;
power.&#xD;
"Thank you, sir. I was unjust to question this for an instant.&#xD;
You feared 'to weary me with particulars~ have no other&#xD;
objection to my looking into them ?"&#xD;
"None; certainly.~'&#xD;
She' pored over the columns attentively, and her guardian&#xD;
felt his~ respect for her rising still higher, as the deep thought-&#xD;
fulness which had its'home in the eyes and brow, slowly covered&#xD;
the face. It was no common mind speaking there-it was com-&#xD;
petent to its work. A gleam of pleasure shot across her counte-&#xD;
nance, as she concluded the examination. tipping a pen into&#xD;
the standish, she sketched rapidly a calculation upon a sheet of&#xD;
paper, and spread it before Mr. Dana.&#xD;
&#xD;
A LONE.&#xD;

&#xD;
"I registered a vow, years ago, that my maiden enterprise;&#xD;
when I should come into office, should be the establishment of*&#xD;
a charity school. You have there an estimate of the amount&#xD;
needed to put it into operation-not guess-work, but the actual&#xD;
sum~s I will have to expend for teacher's salary, books and furni-&#xD;
ture, repair~of .the room, and a small remainder for contingent&#xD;
expenses. This knowledge I have gained by inquiry of those&#xD;
familiar with these things. I am confounded at the paltry total&#xD;
-I interpret that arch of the eyebrows," she continued, laugh~&#xD;
ing, "but before you cast any obstacle in my way, listen-dear&#xD;
Mr. Dana! I have kept an 'expense-book' ever since I can&#xD;
recollect. During the first{ winter and spring of my going into&#xD;
society in Richmond, I spent more than. that in dresses and&#xD;
ornaments-the 'two summers I passed with Carry, previous to&#xD;
her marriage, as much more,-for it was. a' fashionable country&#xD;
neighborhood, and in such, the passion for show and ostentation&#xD;
is not a whit less than in the city. The price I should pay for&#xD;
board elsewhere, will meet my personal expenses here; I have&#xD;
no near relatives for whom to economist, and there are scores of&#xD;
children, growing up around me, destitute of education, except&#xD;
~7&#xD;
that bestowed gratis by pQverty and vice.&#xD;
"I - commend 'your resolution, 'my daughter,"-this was his'&#xD;
phrase of greatest endearment-" but it is a weighty undertaking&#xD;
'for a young person; and a woman.. If commenced, it must be&#xD;
prosecuted vigorously, or it will do more harm than good. - One&#xD;
session will hardly suffice for a beginning. This appropriation,&#xD;
which is a liberal deduction from your income, small as you&#xD;
deem it, is not for this year alone. Hitherto your affairs have&#xD;
prospered, but you may have reverses. A failure of crops, which&#xD;
not infrequently happens to others, would embarrass you con-&#xD;
siderably."&#xD;
"I would draw upon my invested funds."&#xD;
"And if stocks fall, or a bank breaks ?"&#xD;
"And what is more probable than thai; all these n~isfortunes&#xD;
will crowd, upon me at once, I may die!" 'said Ida, with per-&#xD;
suasive. gravity, I' and wh~n my Heavenly Master demands the&#xD;

of' my present abundance, and trust th4 he will be as bountiful&#xD;
in time to come, as He has been until n~ow."&#xD;
"There's sense and religion in that I" commented Mr. Grant,&#xD;
admiringly.&#xD;
"He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord," said&#xD;
Ida, 8miing in her guardian's face. "What think you of the&#xD;
security, Mr. Dana ?"&#xD;
"That your faith shames my caution. Assuming that the&#xD;
plan is feasible and prudent in its main points, let us descend to&#xD;
the minuti~.-' Repairs of building'-.where is the room&#xD;
Ida pointed from the window to a house in the yard. "My&#xD;
'father built it for an office-my mother used it as a lumber-&#xD;
room. The plastering has fallen, and t~e roof leaks, but Will&#xD;
tells me the plantatIon carpenter and 'b4cklayer can put it in&#xD;
good order. They can make the desks a~nd benches too."&#xD;
"'Books'-this is the probable outlay, I suppose."&#xD;
"It is computed~ from a list of prices, furnished by a book-&#xD;
seller."&#xD;
"Now~ last and most important-the teacher. Is it to 'be a&#xD;
girls' or a boys' school ?"&#xD;
"For girls, mainly; but small boys will be admitted. Large&#xD;
ones might be refractoryj~p a lady."&#xD;
"You will have an instructress, then? Where will she&#xD;
board 7"'&#xD;
"Here. Shall I not have a spinster household?"&#xD;
"With Miss Betsey to matronise you. You will be fastidious&#xD;
in your selection, as she is to be a member of your family. Your&#xD;
proLvident brain has not picked her out, surely 7"&#xD;
"You will laugh when I say that I have one in view; but I&#xD;
am hesitating as to the propriety 'of making her an offer. I&#xD;
have no false pride to prevent me from engaging in honest&#xD;
labor; but very sensible people, in other respects, are troubled&#xD;
with this weakness. Neither do I mean to term n~ine a 'charity&#xD;
school,' in consideration for pride of a more commendable kind,&#xD;
which the pare~ats may have. The teacher will be my equal&#xD;
and companion. Without interfering with her* government, I&#xD;
shall be as well known, to the pupils as herself'; if she is absent&#xD;
or sick, be her substitute; yet she may regard the situation as&#xD;
&#xD;
too humble. Did you ever see a school-fellow of Carry's named&#xD;
Emma Glenn, a modest, sweet-looking girl ?"&#xD;
"Glenn! I cannot recall her. She is your choice 7"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. She is, like myself, an orphan. Anna Talbot&#xD;
awakened my sympathies for her, by relating how and where&#xD;
she saw her last summer. She is dependent upon her own&#xD;
exertions, and for two years has'* 2ight in the family of an&#xD;
uncle, for. the miserable stipend-think of It, sir! of fifty dollars&#xD;
a year! for instrr~'x~ug six children, two,' of whom, sleep in her&#xD;
chamber; and her positi $ uncomfortable from 'various other&#xD;
causes. She was universally beloved at school; and her stand-&#xD;
ing for 'scholarship, unquesti6nable. Can it be more humiliating&#xD;
to labor as my colleague, than the despised beneficiary of a&#xD;
niggardly relative ?"&#xD;
"I imagine not," he rejoined; smiling. "What is your notion,&#xD;
Mr. Grant, of this hair-brained young lady ?"&#xD;
"That we should all be better, and I am not sure, but wiser&#xD;
too, for some of her spirit ;" he replied.&#xD;
"I am not, I hope, thoughtlessly sanguine, Mr. Dana ;"&#xD;
pursued Ida. "I expect discouragement and difficulties, for I&#xD;
know the class I have to deal with. It is no girl's am1~ition to&#xD;
play lady patroness that spurs me on in this task. The idea&#xD;
originated with my mother, and was a darling scheme of hers&#xD;
and mine; but was laid low with many other benevolent plans&#xD;
-laid~ by, I should say-for my prayer and aim 'are to prove&#xD;
myself worthy of my parentage. Few females at my age ~are&#xD;
placed in my circumstances; and I, do not court notoriety or&#xD;
responsibility, although some will have it so. Constant, stirring&#xD;
exercise is ~s indispensable to my mind 'as body. Forgive me,&#xD;
dear sir; but I have been distressed by an occasional misgiving,&#xD;
that you thought me unfeminine, regardless of public opinion.&#xD;
I love my friends as dearly, truly as any one; J2 have no relish&#xD;
for masculine pursuits; I would have woman move in her God.&#xD;

opportunity for extending my usefulness, I fear not to improve&#xD;
them. Do you understand me&#xD;

Mr. Gramit, seeing they were forgetting him, had, with native&#xD;
delicacy, stepped without the door, upon pretext of sp~paking to&#xD;
a passing laborer.&#xD;
Ida was moved even to tears, A~ her guardian's unqualified&#xD;
encomium, ~o feelingly uttered. TEe esteem of such a luau was,&#xD;
of itself a reward for her conflicts with self and outward tempta-&#xD;
tions. She had so much to be thankful for! she said over and&#xD;
over, that day. She was at home! at Si~nnybank! the air~ was&#xD;
\purer-the water clear\er-tEe birds merrier, there. than any-&#xD;
~irhere else; and there was abiding tranquillity in the thought&#xD;
that she might live and die under the roof-tree. that sheltered her&#xD;
bradle; an enlargement ~f heart and kindliness as she beheld her&#xD;
dependents~ rejoicing in her restoration to them;* looking to her&#xD;
for support and happiness. And that mother's grave was there!&#xD;
*She sat there a long hour at even-tide. The willow leaflets were&#xD;
just putting out, and the swaying of the flexible boughs was&#xD;
slight and noiseless. There was a hush in the air-p-not a dead&#xD;
calm-but* a solemn pause, as if Nature had folded her busy&#xD;
hands to return devout. thanks for mercies past, and gather&#xD;
strength for future labor. Ida was no sickly dreamer now.&#xD;
She knew life, as it is-a day! only a day-divide and .sub-&#xD;
diVide as we may,-the morning hallowed by some with early&#xD;
prayer7squandered by more in trifling; the noon, waxing to&#xD;
its height over reeking brows and panting chests, and straining&#xD;
arms; the evening, relaxing the strung muscles, and curdling&#xD;
the bounding blood, and .bringing to each his meed,-righteous&#xD;
recompense for his deeds, fair or foul; and the night-.-black-&#xD;
b~owed angel, saying to the vexed brain, "Thy work is ended 1"&#xD;
spreading his hands over the swelling heart-wave, and it is still!&#xD;
bidding the harassed body.-4" Sleep on now and take your rest."&#xD;
She knew life, and that to the God-fearing toiler in His vineyard,&#xD;
there is no rest until night. He is not denied the inhalation of&#xD;
&#xD;
the odorous breeze, and a pause in the shade to wipe his heated&#xD;
brow; but he must not swerve from his furrow~to seek it.&#xD;
Flowers, whose kjndred blossom in Paradise, smile up from the&#xD;
unsightly clods, and these he may wear in his bosom, leaving&#xD;
unculled the poppies and almond-laurel which flaunt near by ;~&#xD;
content in knowing but this, what is his work, and. bending,&#xD;
training every power to the strenuous endeavor to do it.&#xD;
Mr. iDana stayed but three days; his family. prolonged their~&#xD;
visit into as many weeks; nor would Ida have resigned them&#xD;
then, had not Emma been daily expected; for the school was a&#xD;
fixed fact. Accompanied and guarded by the faithful Will, Ida&#xD;
had explored the woods, gullies and old fields for recruits. Her&#xD;
determined spirit bore her out, or she would have thrown up the&#xD;
project by the end of the first day. She chose what Will called&#xD;
the "toughest cases" for her freshest energies.&#xD;
"The Digganses" lived in a rickety hut, in the exact centre&#xD;
of a common of broom straw, mowed down to stubble, for ten&#xD;
feet around the door-said area populated at Ida's visit, by five&#xD;
white-headed children, three hounds, and two terrier puppies, a&#xD;
full-grown grunter and a brood of little ones, and half a dozen&#xD;
meagre fowls. The hounds bayed; the terriers squeaked their&#xD;
shrill treble; the pigs squealed, and made for the high straw;&#xD;
the human animal scampered squallingly, into the house; while&#xD;
Ida's horse-to complete the hubbub-set up a frightened neigh,&#xD;
and would have run, but for Will's grip. Without waiting for&#xD;
Mrs. Diggans' "Light! won't you ?" she sprang from the saddle.&#xD;
The hostess came to the door with a greasy, steaming kettle in&#xD;
one hand, and the flesh-fork in the other. She deposited them&#xD;
upon the ground, wiped her hands upon her begrimmed apron,&#xD;
and offered her right. Ida blessed the ignorance of Fashion's&#xD;
laws in these regions, which did not compel her to remove 1~r&#xD;
gloves. The cabin did not belie the promise of the exterior. It&#xD;
was dingy and dixty scented with bacon and cabbage, and. an&#xD;
indescribable smell, a~ of a musty cupboard, converted into a&#xD;
sleeping-room. Yet these people were n~t disreputable, in the&#xD;
ordinary acceptation of the word. They had never been convicted&#xD;
of theft or drunkenness. Indolence and improvidence kept&#xD;
them down, for they were never "up." They were as well&#xD;
off now as when they married; if the children came faster&#xD;

neighbors.&#xD;
"rm mighty pleased to see you 1" said Mrs. Diggans, dusting&#xD;
a wooden cricket with the, convenient apron. "How much&#xD;
you've growled like your mothers Good Fathers! I never see&#xD;
folks more alike. * You've done come home to live, I've&#xD;
I hope so, ma'am."&#xD;
"You didn't like town-folk~, I 'spose ?"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am; I have som~ good friends there, but I think&#xD;
my place is here~"&#xD;
* "Um-I&amp;amp;um! well-you am V married ?"&#xD;
"Oh! no, ma'arn."&#xD;
* "But you're goin' to be, I reckon ?" slyly.&#xD;
"Not that I know of. But how are you getting on, Mrs.&#xD;
IMggans ?"&#xD;
"Ah, Miss Idy! in the same old way ;-can't never make&#xD;
both ends jine, but somehow we lives and fattens."&#xD;
"How many children have you ?"&#xD;
"Six-my biggest girl is out, visiting' her father's kin."&#xD;
"Is it possible! I must be growing old. I rbcollect when&#xD;
~'ou were married. You wore your wedding-dress' the next&#xD;
Sunday, and I thought it was so fine."&#xD;
"I wonder if you do ?" said the flattered Mrs. Diggans.&#xD;
"Who'd a thought it ?-and you so young! One of my chil-&#xD;
dren's named after you-Ide-e-e !" with a car-whistle termina-&#xD;
tion. "Come here this minute! I liked it, 'cause 'twas a pretty&#xD;
name-sort o' high-soundin' you know-Ide-e-e-e I"&#xD;
Ida had ocular evidence of this new beauty of her cognomen.&#xD;
And your mother was gllers mighty kind to~ me-ah! \she&#xD;
was a lady-every inch of her !-Ide-e.-e-e! if you don't come&#xD;

And "Idee" sneaked in, fist in her mouth, and scraped her&#xD;
bare toes in ~ frightfull~r flesh-crawling, provoking manner, while&#xD;
her namesake informed ~ier of their relation to each other.&#xD;
"How old are you, I~Ia?"&#xD;
"Going on seven ;" answered the mother.&#xD;
"Can you read ?"&#xD;
"Bless your' life, Miss Idy! I don't have time to teach them,&#xD;
&#xD;

nor their father neither. Mercy knows how they are to git&#xD;

re-spectable to know how to read and write."&#xD;
"But you can, read, Mrs. Digg~ins."&#xD;
"I used to could."&#xD;
"You do not object to their being taught if you are not&#xD;
troubled about it ?"&#xD;
"No-o. I reckon not-but who's a goin' to do it? thar's&#xD;

"I will have it done."&#xD;
"Y~in~! Miss Ida! oh-oh I teaching' poor folk's chillen ain't&#xD;

"Say you will send them, Mrs. Diggans,, and I pledge you&#xD;
my word they shall be as carefully attended to, as if they were&#xD;
the richest in the land."&#xD;
She explained her plan. Mrs. Diggan~ demurred.&#xD;
"She couldn't spar Maria Julia,~and Ahne .Marthy was too&#xD;
little to walk so far ;-.then their clothes wasn't fitten. She&#xD;
was mighty obliged, jest as much as if she had absent' em."&#xD;
"I am very sorry," said Ida. "I came here first, knowing&#xD;
your attachment to our family. I am really desirous you should&#xD;
oblige me. I am so disappointed."&#xD;
Mrs. Diggans relented. "If they had decent clothes, Mis~&#xD;
Idy..-See them dirty rags I"&#xD;
"Their clothing must be whole and clean, certainly. Promise&#xD;
they shall attend all the session, and I will give them a suit&#xD;
apiece."&#xD;
"You're too good, Miss Idy-jest like your ma! We'll talk&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
"I must have an answer now. My number is limited, as&#xD;
there will be but one teacher. How many shall I put down ?"&#xD;
producing paper and pencil.&#xD;
" Only two! but that is better than none. 'For the entire&#xD;
session,' Mrs. Diggans; I trust to your word."&#xD;
" I keeps a promise when I makes it. Set 'em down."&#xD;
"Hard customers, Mistis !" said Will, as they remounted.&#xD;
"Rather, Uncle Will; yet I dread our next visit as much.&#xD;

"When he can get money or beg liquor. I feel mean, when&#xD;
he stops me in the road, to borrow a fourpence. 'AhWill!'&#xD;
he says, 'thriving and likely as when you drove your master's&#xD;
carriage after his bride-your late lamented mistis! You don~t&#xD;
happen to have a fourpence in your pocket, my boy? Unfor-&#xD;
tunately, I'm out of change. Thank you, my fine fellow-I'll&#xD;
remember you my lad !'. I can't deny him, Mistis. He knowed&#xD;
your father well, when they were both young men-a smart,&#xD;
handsome gentleman he was! and to think !"&#xD;
"And to see !" thought Ida, as the house peeped through the&#xD;
trees, with unglazed windows, crumbling chimney, and sunken&#xD;
roof. It was presented to him by her father-..~-a neat, comfort-&#xD;
able cottage. His wife died of a broken heart; the children&#xD;
wero saved from starvation and freezing, times without number,&#xD;
by her mother. How they subsisted now, was an impenetrable&#xD;
mystery; for the father never did a stroke of work, and loafed&#xD;
around the country, thrusting himself~ upon the hospitality of&#xD;
those with whom he had associated in former years, wearing his&#xD;
welcome-not threadbare, but into shreds, before he let go.&#xD;
In a beggar's garb, and soliciting alms from the slaves o( his old&#xD;
companions, he retained the boastful swagger and ornate language&#xD;
which earned for him, in youth, the soubriquet of "Pompous&#xD;
Finely."&#xD;
The eldest daughter was sitting upon the dbor-step, dressed&#xD;
almost in tatters; her matted hair twisted up ~with a tinsel comb&#xD;
-a gift from her father, in a generously drunken fit; and&#xD;
the remnants of a pair of silk stockings hanging about a neatly&#xD;
turned foot and ankle. Hei face was clean; and Ida could not&#xD;
but observe its beauty, as she blushed and smiled an embarrassed&#xD;
welcome.&#xD;
"You have not forgotten me, Laura; but you have grown&#xD;
so, I scarcely knew you. Are you all well ?"&#xD;
"Except pap~, who has a headache. Walk in."&#xD;
"No, thank you. It is pleasant out here." She seated herself&#xD;
upon a block beside the door. "Where are the children ?"&#xD;
"Gone to look for strawberries."&#xD;
"Isn't it to6 early for them ?"&#xD;
"I'm afraid sor-but they wanted some so badly."&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       339&#xD;
Ida suspected, from her stammering, that more substantial&#xD;
food would have been as acceptable.&#xD;
"I came partly on business, Laura," she hastened to say,&#xD;
apprehending an irruption from the interior. "I am trying to&#xD;
get up ~ s4~hool in the neighborhood, to be taught at Sunnybank,&#xD;
by. a friend of mine-"&#xD;
"Miss Ross! do I in truth, have the felicity ?" Ida groaned&#xD;
in spirit. . "The softened image of my ever lamented friend I"&#xD;
continued the inebriate, whose headache was easily accounted&#xD;
for. Putting his hand to his heart, he heaved a profound sigh.&#xD;
"Ah! my dear young lady.! may you have the inheritance of&#xD;
his transceadant virtues, as of his faultless physiognomy! Laura,&#xD;
my daughter-have you offered our guest refreshments ?"&#xD;
"Excuse me., sir! I have not time to partake of them. I wa~&#xD;
apologising to Laura for my first visit being a business call."&#xD;
"She wants to opei~ a school up at Sunnybank, papa. Do&#xD;
let us go !" cried the girl, eagerly. His face wore a mask of&#xD;
extreme concern.&#xD;
"It cannot be! the righteous Fates can never be so oblivious&#xD;
to unparalleled excellence as to ordain that you-the solitary&#xD;
scion of an aristocratic race, shall be reduced by unpropitious&#xD;
vicissitudes, to the necessity of mailitaining yourself by the&#xD;
arduous employment of imparting instruction to the juvenile&#xD;
mind !"&#xD;
"A friend is to be the instrucifess, sir. I shall exercise a&#xD;
general supervision."&#xD;
" What a mountain you remove! I trembled at the sup-&#xD;
position that you were precipitated upon the frozen charities&#xD;
of a mercenary world. Ah, my young friend! the most shameful&#xD;
part of human hypocrisy is the heartless repudiation of unmerited&#xD;
exigency !"&#xD;
"May we go, papa ?" persisted the daughter. "'1 so want&#xD;
to learn !"&#xD;
"My beloved! wariness is indispensable in the adjudication&#xD;
of a measure vitally affecting y~ur intellectual progress. Is your&#xD;

"Your enthusiastic9 philanthropy misleads you. Cannot be an&#xD;
accomplice to this ge~ierousfraud. My children remain in their&#xD;
own habitation unless your friend accepts compensation for her&#xD;
toils \~&#xD;
Lai~ra looked ashamed and sorrowful, and Ida restrained her&#xD;
indignant contempt. "We will not differ about a trifle, Mr.&#xD;
Pinel~.. The terms and time of payment ~re subject to your&#xD;
discretion and convenience. I may enter your little ones-~&#xD;
Laura included? There are three, besides yourself, Laura ?"&#xD;
"They are docile to the flow~er-wreathed wand of moral suasion,&#xD;
Miss Ross, but may betray obduration if sterner means are&#xD;
employed. Of corporeal punishment we will not speak. the&#xD;
rod would fall barbless, from the lily digits of gentle woni4."&#xD;
"You will come to school, Monday week ;" Ida was skying&#xD;
to Laura: "but do not wait until then to pay me a visit. I&#xD;
must have~a long talk with you. Good bye."&#xD;
Tears stood in Laura's eyes. Already she regarded her bene-&#xD;
factress with feelings bordering upon devotion. Ida, in her sober&#xD;
ride, turning over the degradation and misery whose alleviation&#xD;
seemed impracticable, had no suspicion of the leaven she had&#xD;
hidden in the heavy lump.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.                       841&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
ANNA TALBOT'S sketch of Emma's privations was not over-&#xD;
drawn. If her condition had been tolerable, an offer from Ida&#xD;
Ross, as she recollected her,~-proud and unsociable,-would not&#xD;
have tempted her to change it. But Ida was honorable and&#xD;
liberal, despite her haughtiness; and in her uncle's family, she&#xD;
was an ill-paid under-servant. Ida sent her carriage and servants&#xD;
for her; and this regard for her comfort, while it called forth&#xD;
the contumely of her employers, raised her hopes of a friendly&#xD;
reception.&#xD;
"There's my mistis in the porch," said Will, leading down&#xD;
from his perch, to speak to his fair passenger. They were&#xD;
driving up an avenue, closed by a house, which, to Emma's&#xD;
modest eyes, was an imposing architectural pile. A haze dimmed&#xD;
her vision; in her agitation, she saw nothing of the awful figure&#xD;
Will pointed out, but the flutter of white drapery. The great&#xD;
yard-gates were open, and the carriage rolled over the gravelled&#xD;
circle which swept by the main~ entrance. She did not recognize&#xD;
the frank, sweet face that appeared at the carriage-door, but&#xD;
the voice was not to be forgotten. ' I am very glad you are&#xD;
come 1" it said, and the kiss and the embrace verified the welcome.&#xD;
"How changed I" was the thought of each. Emma was thin,&#xD;
and when the glow of the meeting faded-dejected. She looked,&#xD;
to Ida, like one who had been subjected to a constant weight,&#xD;
bending body and heart, almost to breaking,-as if the on~&#xD;
feather more would end the torture. And her own spirit; gaining&#xD;
buoyancy day by day, under its discipline, gathered force from&#xD;
the necessity of restoring the lost elasticity to another's. She&#xD;
conducted her school-fellow to a chamber, once hers, and adjoining&#xD;
that she now occupied; divested her of her heavy hat and shawl,&#xD;
and commanded her imperatively to "lie down." Emma&#xD;
reposed her weary limbs upon a luxurious mattress; the breeze&#xD;
waving the spotless curtains, and whispering of green hills, and&#xD;
cool forests and violet banks; her hostess, after vainly attempt..&#xD;
29*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7999-00000172"/>&#xD;
ing to persuade her that she required sleep-bathing her head&#xD;
with fragrant waters, and talking in inspiriting, affectionate&#xD;
tones, which were more than manna tQ her hungry heart. Mrs&#xD;
Dana had gone the preceding day, and Emma was soon con..&#xD;
minced that she had done a charitable-most meritorious deed,&#xD;
in arriving when she did; but she smiled, as she heard the&#xD;
lively voice dilate upon the "horrors" and "azure imps," that&#xD;
had infested the house while she was sole occupant~-" always&#xD;
excepting my chaperon and s6i-disant housekeeper, good Miss&#xD;
Betsey-soi-di~sant as I am, in point of fact, housekeeper myself.&#xD;
I have a great fancy to see to everything with my own eyes.&#xD;
We are retired here-I wrote this, you know-but there are&#xD;
some agreeable families within visiting distance. I am delighted.&#xD;
at having a helper in the labor of receiving and returning visits;&#xD;
and my rides and walks will be doubly pleasaiit. Are you fond&#xD;
of out-door exercise?".&#xD;
"Very-but I have neglected the duty for a year or two past."&#xD;
~ shall not be so remiss here. I intend to be exacting.&#xD;
A gallop before breakfast, and a walk-not a promenade--&#xD;
before tea, will plant bright roses in these white cheeks. . When&#xD;
you are rested, we will unlock our budget of news. Having&#xD;
been apart for so long, each will have a week's steady talk."&#xD;
When she arose, revived in spirits and strength, she was&#xD;
taken over the premises "to see her home." Mr. Grant 'was&#xD;
introduced, and doffed his hat as to a queen; the negroes were&#xD;
respectfully cordial to the friend of their mistress; but more than&#xD;
all, Ida's bearing assured the trampled-down orphan, that she&#xD;
was here second to Done-superior in command and importance&#xD;
10 all, except the head of the establishment. It may have been&#xD;
the earnestness, wiilch was the prevailing element of Ida'~*&#xD;
character, or her sympathetic nature, (Charley affirmed it was&#xD;
the latter,) which made it impossible for those who knew her,&#xD;
to be indifferent, or lukewarm in their sentiments towards her~&#xD;
Mr. Read, Josephine and Pemberton, having seen the . wrong&#xD;
side of her disposition, hated her with a rancor, benefits nor&#xD;
patient efforts could appease. Her chosen intimates found no&#xD;
mate for their affection, but in their esteem and respect. Lynn's&#xD;
love for her was more like worship than that he entertained for&#xD;
&#xD;
Ellen-adored as she with Carry, she had no compeer of&#xD;
her sex; the exceeding 'tenderneSs of John Dana and his wife&#xD;
was a mystery to themselves; and in Charley's heart she had&#xD;
the highest place-taking rank even of the brother, to whom&#xD;
he had sacrificed his hopes of earthly bliss. Emma e~perieneed,&#xD;
and yielded to the charm; she could not have resisted suc-&#xD;
cessfully, if she would; for Ida was determined to attach her&#xD;
to herself, and her indomitable resolution would have accom-&#xD;
plished this, had her attractive qualities been less winningly&#xD;
displayed. From. the moment of her arrival, Emma improved,&#xD;
and as the beautiful tracery of her character came out, to reward&#xD;
the warm rays love poured over it, Ida was confirmed in hei&#xD;
satisfaction at her choice. SheL had not entire~ confidence in hei&#xD;
ability to ~control the restive spirits, which had run wild, without&#xD;
rule or rein ;,'but this fear vanished with a careful observation&#xD;
of her government and its results. If the "wand" was "flower.&#xD;
wreathed," it was no supple or brittle reed, to bend or snap in&#xD;
the storm. None, who had once rebelled against her mild autho-&#xD;
rity, were ever inclined to repeat the offeiwe.&#xD;
If, as had been asserted, Ida sought the Utopia of her fanciful&#xD;
dreams in her "return to Palestine," as she playfully styled it;&#xD;
if her ideas of country life were drawn from pastorals 'and&#xD;
romances, she would have sunk under the drawbacks and iron&#xD;
realities she encountered. Her influence over her servants were*&#xD;
strong; but amopg so many, inr3ubordination reared its head,&#xD;
now and then. The idle and sulky, deceived by her amenity&#xD;
and care for their. welfare, appealed from Mr. Grant's decisions&#xD;
to her clemency; and with so much plausibility, that when fhis&#xD;
mode of undermining his laws was new, she was ready g0 sustain&#xD;
them. Consistent, however, to her principle of examining both&#xD;
sides of a question, she refused to reverse &amp;amp;any decree, before&#xD;
hearing all the circumstances; and invariably, when this was&#xD;
done, ratified the original judgment. There were old and&#xD;
privileged supernumeraries who talked of her father's child-&#xD;
hood, as a thing of yesterday; and volunteering the advantage&#xD;
of their experience for the benefit of the "poor chile,"-tossed&#xD;
their heads high at the idea of her controlling or enlightening&#xD;
them. Adding to self-righteousness, the whims and peevishness&#xD;

of age, they caused Ida ore annoyance than the management&#xD;
of the whole estate besid 5; and hardly less than the never-&#xD;
ending vexatious of the and their neighbors of the&#xD;
same stamp, not to i~iention Pinely-most wearisome of all. lie&#xD;
penned voluminous epistles, to complain of "a trivial oversight&#xD;
in her otherwise irreproachable system of philanthropy," or&#xD;
to convey a "father's acknowledgments for the soul-elevating&#xD;
teachings of which his beloved offspring were accipients ;" and&#xD;
when they were unnoticed, his visits were frequent. She&#xD;
received him with distant politeness; and strove to .repress his&#xD;
forwardness by chilling dignity-.and he came again next day.&#xD;
At last he presented himself in the parlor, where Were Emma&#xD;
and herself-so intoxicated, that he could not stand upright.&#xD;
'His tongue was ily as ever, notwithstanding his limbs refused&#xD;
to do their offlc~; and when Will entered, in answer to the&#xD;
vehement ring, h~ was holding the door with both hands, swing-&#xD;
ing it with~ him in his attempts to bow to the ladies, he was&#xD;
addressing as, "incomparable pair! whose supereminent enchant-&#xD;
ments are confessed ~by the most hebete of created intelligences"&#xD;
Emma had shrunk into a corner, and Ida, her hand still upon&#xD;
the bell-rope----her brow frowning-spoke in a lofty tone, "Uncle&#xD;
Will! you will conduct this gentleman to the porch, and as much&#xD;
further as he shall see convenient to go. It is necessary to&#xD;
~ each him to exercise some discrimination as to the times 01&#xD;
is visits."&#xD;
~ For Laura, the girls were strongly interested. Her pro-&#xD;
ress in her studies was incredibly rapid; and their wretched&#xD;
ome, if comfortless, was clean. She had no means of providing&#xD;
wardrobes or furniture; ~nd Ida, hailing~ the dawning reforma-&#xD;
tion, contributed as delicately as she could, such articles as they&#xD;
needed most. Laura's taste was good; and her aptitude enabled&#xD;
l~er to catch the ways and language of her friends, with fidelity&#xD;
and quickness. In six months after Ida's business call, she&#xD;
would not have been ashamed to introduce her in any company,&#xD;
however polished. But how was this to end? Would it not&#xD;
be wiser benevolence to content themselves with bestowing the&#xD;
rudiments of &amp;amp; con mon education, without exciting aspirations&#xD;
after pursuits, so incongruous with the occupations of her lowly&#xD;
&#xD;
315&#xD;
&#xD;
station, as belles lettres, music and drawing? Ida put the&#xD;
objection down with an irreversible negative.&#xD;
"The girl has a mind! and every intellect which God makes,.&#xD;
should receive all the nutrient it can absorb. Let us give&#xD;
her her quantum, and in time she will reach her level. She is&#xD;
below it at present. ~ that odious father were out of her&#xD;
way I"&#xD;
"He will be a drag to her as long as he lives ;" said Emma.&#xD;
"Yes, and alas! he is more fit to live than to die. You have&#xD;
read of the beggar idiot, who told Sir Walter Scott that he&#xD;
would be perfectly happy, but for the 'Bubly Jock,' (turkey&#xD;
gobbler,) that followed him everywhere. Pinely is my 'Bubly&#xD;
Jock,' I listen to hear him gobble whenever he comes near me."&#xD;
"Laura has an uncommon talent for music ;~' said Emma.&#xD;
"I have remarked it;" replied Ida, "and we have thought&#xD;
of the same thing, that her surest path to independence, and the&#xD;
position in society his vice has lost, is to qualify herself for a&#xD;
teacher. I waited to consult you before recommending it to&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"And that delay was unnecessary. You can take my consent&#xD;
for granted in everything your judgment approves. Now, Laura&#xD;
has no motive but her love for knowledge and us. With a&#xD;
definite aim, she will surmount every difficulty, for her energy&#xD;
is as remarkable as her ability."&#xD;
This was one of their twilight talks in the roomy porch.&#xD;
"I believe," paid Ida, laughing; "Miss Betsey fears the Ross&#xD;
pride is extinct in me. It costs her a twinge to see me teach&#xD;
my sable class, and she mc~destly hinted, this morning, that her&#xD;
chamber, or th~ dining-room would, be a more. proper place for&#xD;
their recitations, than mine. I represented to her that they&#xD;
were not there more than an hour in the day, and came in&#xD;
groups of three or four-one set retiring as another entered;&#xD;
and that they felt a pride in being neat and orderly, because&#xD;
they were in~ 'Mistis' room,'-but the dear old creature was not&#xD;
satisfied, although she held her peace."&#xD;
" And you are the Ida Ross, whose pride kept the whole school&#xD;
at a distance I" exclaimed Emma. "How you were misunder~&#xD;
stood !"&#xD;

"Understood, my dear! if I appeared disagreeable and selfish.&#xD;
That wa~ my dark age, Emma. How much has transpired since!&#xD;
how mu~hof sorrow-how much of joy I"&#xD;
"You are* not unhappy now !" said Emma, in a tone of stir-&#xD;
prised inquiry&#xD;
"No, my love! happy and busy-~-an~ thankful for my Father's&#xD;
love and favors-not the least of which is His gift of a corn-&#xD;
panion..&#xD;
Carry had asked her a similar question during her first sum-&#xD;
mer at Poplar grove-with what different emotions she had&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
"But," she resumed, "the unbending will is not dead yet.&#xD;
Dr. hall and' lady called on me to..day, and I unfolded our&#xD;
prospectus o~ &amp;amp;~Sabbath-school. The doctor pursed up his mouth&#xD;
in his quizzical way. 'The Church is four miles from you.'&#xD;
"'But oily three from you,' said I.&#xD;
." 'There is preaching there, on an average, two Sabbaths&#xD;
in a month.~ Will not that interfere with your instructions?'&#xD;
"'Not at all, sir. We shall be through by the hour for public&#xD;
worship.'&#xD;
"'But there will not be time to go to another church, where&#xD;
there is no service.~&#xD;
" 'Can't help it, sir. We nfust go home and read a sermon,&#xD;
seasoned by the consciousness of duty performed.'&#xD;
"'You have a school-mania;' said he.&#xD;
"'The grown trees are so stubbornly crooked, that I have&#xD;
no hope but in the twigs.'&#xD;
"'A fair hit, - doctor!' said Mrs. Hall. 'Submit with&#xD;
a good grace. He was wishing, the other day, for something&#xD;
to keep. 'idle men ~ and children off of 'Satan's ground.' He&#xD;
is feigning objections, Ida.'&#xD;
"'A bad game, doctor,' answered I. 'We will have the&#xD;
school, and what is more,-you for superintendent.'&#xD;
"He remonstrated now in earnest, butwe out-talked him. He&#xD;
and Mr. Lathain are to circulate the information, and solicit aid&#xD;
and scholars."&#xD;
"Who says unmarried women can do nothing in the work&#xD;
of the world's reformation ?" said Emma. . "How many in&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
your situation, would be wrapped up in self; with a churlish&#xD;
delight that tl~e claims of their fellow-creatures upon them were&#xD;
so feeble."&#xD;
"A woman's heart, in its healthy state, must have some-&#xD;
thing to love ;" returned Ida.' "The fountain is perennial,&#xD;
so long as its waters are drawn off Step their o~itgoings-&#xD;
stagnation-poisonous miasma-dryness ensue. The more we&#xD;
have to love, the better we feel-the better we are, Emma-for&#xD;
the closer is our approximation to the Being, who is all love 1"&#xD;
"This time, a year ago, I was disposed to think that ir~ the&#xD;
economy of His Providence, crosses and trials were all His chil-&#xD;
dren's portion in this life. Sweetly has He rebuked my want&#xD;
of faith I" said Emma.&#xD;
"Not a year ago," rejoined Ida, "His ways to me were&#xD;
past finding out. I wished to stay here in peaceful seclusion,&#xD;
and He sent me again into the world. The 'silver lining' of&#xD;
the cloud, impervious then, is already visible. Leaving out the&#xD;
experience I have acquired in that time, I should have corn-&#xD;
meuced my residence here under a guardianship, which made&#xD;
interest and appearance the guage of fidelity; should have&#xD;
missed Mr. Dana's invaluable assistance; have lost an oppor-&#xD;
tunity to forget past grievances, and return good for evil-i-more&#xD;
than one, indeed. I' had not heard then, that you were teach-&#xD;
ing, and should not, therefore, have thought of you as a&#xD;
co-laborer. Uncle Will would say we 'ought to be happy in&#xD;
the Lord's' appointed way."'&#xD;
"There is no other path of peace," said Emma. "Yet I am&#xD;
foolishly ungrateful sometimes, in misinterpreting what He&#xD;
has done, and peering into the 'shadowy future."'&#xD;
"That was, formerly, my besetting sin Now I have ~o&#xD;
guard against cooking g mournfully into ~he past.' What a&#xD;
world of meaning~ in those few words! And how like a trumpet-&#xD;
call to the 'worla's field of battle,' sound the inspired exhorta.&#xD;

I can see the vigorous, upward fling of his arm, as shouting&#xD;
that last line, h~ shakes out his banner ir~the morning breeze!&#xD;
It thrills through~ every nerve, as I recite it."&#xD;
"His is the true Bible philosophy," said Emma, "'living&#xD;
by the day,'-.saying, as we fall asleep at night-..&#xD;
'To-morrow, Lord! is Thine,&#xD;
Lodged in Thy sovereign hand;&#xD;
And if its sun arise and shine,&#xD;
It shines by Thy command!'&#xD;
Dear Lynn !" sighed Ida. "They sung that hymn ~it his&#xD;
funeral."&#xD;
"'Looking mournfully I"' said Emma, in affectionate chiding.&#xD;
"Yes! yet not repiningly. I was thinking, also, of the sure&#xD;
pleasure we have in the possession of our Father's love. We&#xD;
know that is pure, and cannot pass away; while our most skinless&#xD;
earthly attachments are enjoyed with trembling."&#xD;
The Sunday-school, a novelty to all-the scoff of riot a few,&#xD;
opened with fifty scholars and five teachers-Dr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Hall, Mr. Latham, a student of medicine and protege of the&#xD;
former, Ida and Emma. Classing the children according to&#xD;
their capacity and attainments, the Doctor apportioned an eqrial&#xD;
number to each of his assistants, and planted himself before&#xD;
a form, containing ten of the most unpromising. "There must&#xD;
be an awkward squad," he said, afterwards, "and who is more&#xD;
fit to comn~and it ?" Reinforcements were on the ground by&#xD;
the following Sabbath. The number of pupils constantly in-&#xD;
creased; some who came to see remained to teach.; and others&#xD;
were pressed into service by the energetic superintendent.&#xD;
Having induced him to put his hand to the plough, Ida gave&#xD;
over her exertions in that quarter; he drove as straight and&#xD;
deep a furrow as she could have desired. She was a teacher&#xD;
in an obscure corner, and nothing in her appearance or that of&#xD;
her class, distinguished them from the crowd, but when the&#xD;
thread-like nil widened into a flood, bearing broadly, steadily&#xD;
onward, the wonder and praise of its early opponents, she felt&#xD;
an honest pride in the reflection, that the witch-wand of Chris-&#xD;
tian charity which had bent to the source of the stream was&#xD;
hers. Dr. Hall was mindful of this, and with the mistaken, but&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
349&#xD;
&#xD;
well-meant importunity of gratitude, begged her to occupy a&#xD;
more conspicuous post. She had contributed largely to the&#xD;
library, the selection of which was left wholly to hei, and he&#xD;
entreated her to act as librarian. She declined, laughingly, and&#xD;
more positively, as he insisted; and at length, was driven to&#xD;
pay, that "if it were for the actual good of the school, she would&#xD;
even do violence to her sense of propriety, and comply; as it&#xD;
was not, she hoped to be excused from occupying a stand, which&#xD;
was, for a lady, at best, but an honorable pillory." And the&#xD;
Doctor, finally comprehending what other men as wise and&#xD;
exemplary, are slow to admit-that to use one's talents does&#xD;
not imply the abandonment of the retiring modesty of woman-&#xD;
hood-installed Mr. Latham in the .vacant chair.&#xD;
Ida was not too much absorbed in her numerous avocations&#xD;
to think of, and communicate with her absent friends. Her cor~&#xD;
respondence with Mrs. Dana, Carry and Charley was regular;&#xD;
John Dana wrote longer letters to her than to any one besides&#xD;
his wife; she heard, once in a while, from Alice, Murray, and&#xD;
through her, learned that Mrs. Read was living in strict retire-&#xD;
ment at her father's, seeing none but her near relatives and&#xD;
friends; and that Richard was playing the' lover to Lelia Arnold.&#xD;
"But," said the merry writer-" who angles for him, must bait&#xD;
one of *these patent hooks, which hold, as well as catch." Ida&#xD;
sighed softly, as she read, and was unceasingly busy for the rest&#xD;
of the day; her infallible remedy for sombre thoughts. Mrs.&#xD;
Read had written once, while Ida was at Mr. -Dana's-a mere&#xD;
note of remembrances and thanks. She might have supposed&#xD;
that Josephine had forgotten her existence, but for an uncom-&#xD;
fortable suspicion that the cessation of Anna's friendly, billets&#xD;
was owing to her influence. Ellen Morris wrote often, and&#xD;
spent a fortnight with her and Emma in August. Ida 'signalled&#xD;
Carry of the intended visit, and invited her to join in the re-&#xD;
union. She was eagerly expected each evening of Ellen's stay,&#xD;
and as often they looked in vain. The guest had been gone a&#xD;
week, before tidings came from Poplar grove. It was a double&#xD;
letter. Arthur w~ote that the little Ida was recovering from an&#xD;
alarming illness. The crisis had passed now. They would have&#xD;
sent for her, but the child's danger was so imminent for many&#xD;

days, that there was no certainty that she would survive until a&#xD;
letter reached~nnn~bank. "If she had died"-and the strong&#xD;
physician's hand had trembled as he wrote it.-" I should have&#xD;
taken our Carry to you. It wa~ a heart-breaking trial to her.-.&#xD;
I trust, not an unsanctified one."~&#xD;
Carry's was a blotted sheet, penned in agitation or haste, but&#xD;
its contents were cheering wine t~ Ida's soul, There was much&#xD;
said of her unworthiness, and thaiikless reception of the goodness&#xD;
whieh had followed her all the days of her life, and thank~giv.&#xD;
ings for her child's restoration, with slight allusions to her&#xD;
harrowing anxiety, while it was suspended 'twixt life and death.&#xD;
".Pray, dear Ida," said she, "that I may forever cling to the&#xD;
cross, to which I fled in m~ distressful hour !"&#xD;
C~ Another!" said Ida, with tearful gladness. "Oh! blessed&#xD;
Redeemer! is there not~ room in Thy fold for all ?"&#xD;
"Surely," she replied to Carry, "None of us liveth to himself,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
LAURA PINELY was practising her music lesson in the parlor&#xD;
one day, when the4 entrance of a visitor transferred the motion&#xD;
from her fingers to her feet. "I only glanced at him as he&#xD;
bowed to me on my way out," she said to Ida. "He is tall and&#xD;
handsome."&#xD;
"Have you ever seen N:r. Dana ?"&#xD;
"Yes ina'am, and it is not he This is a younger man, and&#xD;
much fairer."&#xD;
"Who can it be 7" pondered Ida, crossing the hall. "I 'wish&#xD;
he had~'sent in his name; I do not like to be taken by surprise."&#xD;
But she was, as Richard Copeland rose to meet her.&#xD;
"I had no thought of seeing you !" she said, expressing her&#xD;
pleasure at his coming. "I did not know you were in this part&#xD;
of the country."&#xD;
"Nor was I, yesterday."&#xD;
"You have been riding all day; have you dined 7"&#xD;
He arrested her movement towards the bell. "What are~you&#xD;
about to do 7"&#xD;
"Order refreshments for yourself, and have your-horse~ put&#xD;
up."&#xD;
"'Entertainment for man and beast?"' he responded, w~h a&#xD;
sickly smile. "I dined on th9 road-my steed ditto; and he~can&#xD;
stand where he is for a half-hour."&#xD;
"Half-an-hour, Mr. Copeland! You are not in the city !~'&#xD;
"But my visit must be short. How has the world ~r~ated ~rou&#xD;
Since oW.r parting 7"&#xD;
"Excellently well !" said she, gaily, but secretly ill at ease&#xD;
at the alteration* she observed in him. His manner to her was&#xD;
subduedl~respectful; but a reckless, lilas~ air hung about him,&#xD;
token of carelessness or dissipation.&#xD;
"Your friends at home are well, I hope," she said.&#xD;
~" Quite well. Helen-" the remembered' cloud lowered&#xD;
gloom~ly..-.-" sent her regards."&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
"And you may carry my love back to her., I will not repay&#xD;
formality by formality."&#xD;
"Love ?" questioned he, with a keen glance.&#xD;
"Yes-.-why not ?"&#xD;
"What reason have you to love her 7"&#xD;
"Certainly no cause for dislike," she replied. "She treated&#xD;
me kindly."&#xD;
"'A dizzy man sees the world go round;"' quoted Richard.&#xD;
"Mr. Copeland I" said Ida, with a grave sincerity, that always&#xD;
unmasked dissimulation. "For the short time we are together,&#xD;
let us speak as friends, who understand each other. Or do you&#xD;
prefer that I shall meet you upon your own ground ~f satirical&#xD;
innuendo 7"&#xD;
"As friends, Miss Ida! you have proved that the name is not&#xD;
meaningless. But we do not understand each other."&#xD;
"We did!" said she.&#xD;
"Partially. You have risen-I fallen iii the scale of being,&#xD;
since then. Your conduct to my unhappy sister, has imposed a&#xD;
debi/of gratitude upon us-upon me, especially, which words&#xD;
cannot liquidate. This is the one subject of mutual interest to&#xD;
Helen and myself. She is, in effect, a cloistered nun; an&#xD;
unsmiling ascetic;-atoning for the sins of youth by penances&#xD;
and alms. This phase of piety is the larv&amp;amp;~ stage, I imagine,&#xD;
Miss Ross 7" A grieved look answered the sneer. "Pardon&#xD;
me! if your charity can make allowance for one, who has become&#xD;
a doubter from extraneous influences, rather than nature. Helen&#xD;
and myself have never exchanged a word, except upon common~&#xD;
place topics, during her widowhood, until three days ago. I&#xD;
had avowed my implacable hatred of her lover in her hearing.&#xD;
O~her members of the family, have caught stray rumors here and&#xD;
there,-sent out, do~ibtless, by Miss Read; but their unbelief in&#xD;
them being settled by my silence, and Helen's apparent affliction,&#xD;
they have not noticed them except by a passing denial.. But&#xD;
Helen knew that I watched her, and her surveillance of me was&#xD;
as jealously vigilant. I have seen her face blanch in an agony&#xD;
of alarm at my quitting her for au hour; and the most tender&#xD;
sister never wept and prayed for a brother's 'return, a~ she did&#xD;

for mine. I should not have been here now~ but for intelligence,&#xD;
received a week since, of Ashuin's death."&#xD;
"Death 1" ejaculated Ida, horrified. How had the "bold,&#xD;
bad man" gone to his account? Where was he ~ow&#xD;
"He was killed in a duel in Bourdeaux," said Richard, cooly.&#xD;
"The villain, escaped a less honorable fate by flight. Devoted&#xD;
as Helen was to him, the news was a' relief,.-removi~g as it did,&#xD;
her apprehensions of our meeting. So much for her. Thus ends&#xD;
the last chapter of that tragedy 1" His countenance lost its&#xD;
bitter scorn.&#xD;
"Miss Ida-before I met you, I never feared to speak what&#xD;
was in my 'thoughts. Policy or compassion may have deterred&#xD;
me-but cowardice never! I believed I had read every page in&#xD;
man's or woman's heart, and could flutter them with a breath.&#xD;
You were a study, taken up in curiosity, and baffling me ~by its&#xD;
very simplicity. You furnished me with a clue; but my skepti-&#xD;
cism cast it aside-to seek it again, and admit its efficacy in a&#xD;
solitary instance. Ingenuous in word and deed--you had yet,&#xD;
a hidden his tory. I felt it then, vaguely.-.not able to tell from&#xD;
whence the consciousness sprung. Can it be that virtue thrives&#xD;
only in the shade ?"&#xD;
He stopped again. Ida's face was crimsoning slowly with&#xD;
confusion and suspense.&#xD;
"It must be said 1" resumed he, desperately. "I may probe&#xD;
a wound, or touch a callous heart. Miss Ross! will you state to&#xD;
me candidly, the character of your acquaintance with Mr. ]i~acy ?"&#xD;
* Ida's tongue was palsied. She would ~have given her estate*&#xD;
for power to say-." He was my friend ;" but it was denied.&#xD;
* "Then bear with me awhile; The evening of our introduction,&#xD;
I imparted to you the information of Lelia Arnold's engage-&#xD;
ment; and, your deprecation of her riffing seemed only the&#xD;
detestation of a pure and upright soul. If I saw mournful pity&#xD;
in the eyes, which were often riveted by her beauty, I suspected&#xD;
no more. Before leaving Richmond, I heard that he had been--..&#xD;
perhaps was, then your lover :-the direction of your preference&#xD;
was not known. In my superior sagacity, I opined that my&#xD;
friend Germaine was his fortunate rival. Your rejection of his&#xD;
suit recalled the ~ossip I had not thought worth remembering.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lelia was Helen's confidante; knew of her betrothal to Ashlin,&#xD;
and surmised, if she was not informed of the rupture, when it&#xD;
occurred. After Mr. Read's death, my mother mentioned 'inci-&#xD;
dentally, that her influence had been exerted to the utmost, to&#xD;
persuade her friend to accept him. Until I heard that, I' had&#xD;
laughed at her snares to entangle me-the only man, it was&#xD;
said, who was invulnerable to her arts. I despised her before,&#xD;
I hated her now; yet the county rung with exclamations over&#xD;
my capture; and the fair Lelia, in her exultation, was beguiled&#xD;
into an impolitic show of tenderness. I have her picture, her&#xD;
ring, her letters. I could dash thei~i into the sea, without a&#xD;
pangy and would plunge after them, sooner than marry her. I&#xD;
designed a punishment for her falsehood in friendship and love;'&#xD;
but all the while, was haunted with an indefinite thought that&#xD;
you were to be affected by the result. If your lover had been&#xD;
wiled away by her 'machinations, or more likely-if she had&#xD;
played upon his imagination and 'sense of honor, in an unguarded&#xD;
hour-I could free him~ I intended to see you, and tell you'&#xD;
this, but Helen hastened the execution of the plot. readingg&#xD;
our accustomed reserve, she implored me to quiet her fears&#xD;
touching my marriage. A glimmering of Lelia's treachery had'&#xD;
penetrated her mind ;-she mistrusted that she was playing me&#xD;
false, and that she had deceived others. I struck, a key, which&#xD;
I knew would give a true sound-her love for you. She had:&#xD;
'heard your name coupled with his, she said;. and once, a direct&#xD;
assertion of your attachment for him, but it was from lying lips.&#xD;
If I have wearied and displeased you, intimate it.' If not-.-.&#xD;
here are the proofs to secure you revenge or happiness. Say' the~&#xD;
word, and the dupe is enlightened.' She will not suffer more,&#xD;
that you connive at her disgrace. Her mortification wilt' be&#xD;
public, and is inevitable. Where is Mr. Lacy ?"&#xD;
"I do not know, and would not tell you if I' did 1" cried Ida.&#xD;
"If I were dying of a broken' heart, I would refuse the healing&#xD;
your cold-blooded scheme offered. She may' be-I believe her2&#xD;
uuwQrthy of' him; ,but when he' sought her, he was shackled by'&#xD;
no vows to me. He is not a vain boy, to be flattered into a&#xD;
courtship! if duped, she has cruelly deceived the noblest heart&#xD;
that ever beat. I honor him more for not discovering her snare,&#xD;

tha~i you, for mastering her in duplicity. No! Mr. Copeland!&#xD;
I have no wrongs to avenge upon him or her-iior is it your&#xD;
prerogative, to retaliate for your, or your sister's injuries. We&#xD;
do not understand each other! You impute traits to me, which&#xD;
the weakest of my sex would blush to own; and I thought you&#xD;
generous-higWminded! 'Fallen,' indeed !"~ Her voice shook,&#xD;
and her head sank upon the table. The man of the world was&#xD;
confounded. The lofty tone of her principles towered his plotted&#xD;
vengeance into unmanly spite.&#xD;
He. had been incited to it by the low standard of the sex,&#xD;
his sister's and her associate's conduct had set up in his mind;&#xD;
and a desire to betray the baseness of the currency the accom-&#xD;
plished coquette was passing off upon society-ba9ked by a&#xD;
justifiable displeasure at the evils of which she was tl~e author.&#xD;
"I am to understand th~~t you disdaii~ my offer to serve you ?"&#xD;
he said, rising.&#xD;
She looked up. "To serve me! how thankfully I would avail&#xD;
myself of such! I was hasty-unkind! Do not go yet I"&#xD;
He sat down. "It is all so confused !" she said, apologeti~&#xD;
cally. "You are engaged to Lelia Arnold, and do not love her:&#xD;
~--yet you must have told her that you did !"&#xD;
He colored, and did not reply.&#xD;
'You are meditating a punishment for her-what has she&#xD;
done that you have not ?"&#xD;
"Falsehood-unprovoked falsehood is viler in a woman:. I&#xD;
was driven to it."&#xD;
"Viler in a woman-more despicable in a man! You should&#xD;
be above the petty vanity and ambition, ~at if cultivated, root&#xD;
up our better feelings. Selfishness, love of admiration, and in&#xD;
your~ case, pique, actuated her ;-you have the bare plea of&#xD;
malice !"&#xD;
"Miss Ross! malice !"&#xD;
"Examine, and say if it is not so. Punishment, in this&#xD;
world, has cure for its object. Was this yours? or was it that&#xD;
she might endure the pain she had inflicted upon others ?"&#xD;
"Call it retribution."&#xD;
"There is ~but one Retributive Being. He says 'Vengeance&#xD;
is mi~e!'"&#xD;

A  T  Ch M  1~.              fl&amp;amp;&#xD;
"You are sophisticated, Miss Ida. Your maxims are&#xD;
obsolete in the polity of the age."&#xD;
"Because they are extracts from a changeless code. I am~&#xD;
serious, Mr. Copeland. Your conscience assures you that you:&#xD;
are in the wrong; that you have acted childishly-sinfully.&#xD;
That another debases God's gifts, is no reason why you should&#xD;
sully the fine gold of your heart. You have committed this&#xD;
outrage, or you could not talk of the sweetness of revenge."&#xD;
"And 1 am serious, Miss Ida. Unjust, as you say I have&#xD;
been to myself, I have the manliness to recognize the superiority&#xD;
of a character-the antipodes of mine. I repeat, I regret my&#xD;
inability to serve you. Good evening."&#xD;
"Are you going thus? What if we never meet again ?"&#xD;
"We part friends. Your reproaches, cutting as they were,&#xD;
have not diminished my esteem."&#xD;
She could extort nothing more satisfactory. lie would make&#xD;
no concessions-tender no pledges. Large tears gathered and&#xD;
dropped, as she beheld him mount and ride away; and other&#xD;
emotions than grief at her ill-success sent tributaries to the stream.&#xD;
They prate senselessly who speak of forgotten loves or woes.&#xD;
As in neglected graveyards, briars and weeds spring up, and&#xD;
delude the eye with the semblance of a smooth field, but when&#xD;
levelled to the roots, show the mounds they grow upon ;-so&#xD;
above buried feelings, may wave memories and affections of later&#xD;
years-until some* unforeseen event cuts, like a sickle-blade,&#xD;
through their ranks, and we see, with tears, as of fresh bereave-&#xD;
ment, the graves there still! Ida's was a brave spirit, but it&#xD;
trembled after the temptation was withdrawn. Richard had,&#xD;
unknowingly, been guilty of great cruelty in breaking the seal of&#xD;
her heart's closed chamber. Gingerly as he had handled its&#xD;
precious things, he had caused exquisite pain; and for hours and&#xD;
days, she felt that the door would not shut again. It was hard&#xD;
to smile-hard to concert phrns for the future welfare of others,&#xD;
when before her, was blank darkness. But the whirling chaos&#xD;
was cleared and tranquillised in time; and even Emma, was&#xD;
ignorant of the Btorm.&#xD;
On the fifteenth of October, the heiress of Sunnybank would&#xD;
count~her twenty-~rst birth day. The oldest negroes testified&#xD;

36A L ONE .&#xD;
&#xD;
that it had been the custom in the Ross family, 'for an hundred&#xD;
years, to signalise such occasions with appropriate festivities;&#xD;
and Ida waived her wishes for a quiet visit fr9m her friends; and&#xD;
tried to be as much interested in 'the proposed illumination and&#xD;
feast as if she were not the personage to be honoured. She&#xD;
worked more willingly when the Danas wrote that they were all&#xD;
coming, the Saturday before the fifteenth, ~hich fell on Tuesday.&#xD;
Emma's scholars had a vacation of four we~ks; and Laura Pinely&#xD;
was at the house most of her time. The ti~,ro vi~d with each other&#xD;
in the number and elegance of the decorations of the premises.&#xD;
"What upon earth 1" exclaimed Ida, stumbling over a heap&#xD;
of green boughs in the back porch.. Iloth girls screamed-&#xD;
Oh I take care !" Ida sat down upon a bench, and untwisted&#xD;
a long streamer of running. cedar from her ancle.&#xD;
" What is this 'for ?"&#xD;
"To dress the pictures and looking-glasses," said Emma.&#xD;
"And to festoon upon the walls," chimed in Laura.&#xD;
"And loop up bed and window-curtains," finished Emma.&#xD;
"My dear girls! if 'the President and suit were expected,&#xD;
your preparations would not be more formidable. Why trouble&#xD;
yourselves so much ?"&#xD;
"Trouble! you never incommode yourself for other people!&#xD;
oh no !" replied Emma, in severe irony.&#xD;
"We love the bustle ~and excitement of fixing," said Laura.&#xD;
"And 'what is there for me to do ?" questioned Ida, stooping&#xD;
over the pile.&#xD;
"Nothing! you are to play lady and hold your hands. It is&#xD;
difficult, because unusual work-but please try !" laughed Laura.&#xD;
Miss Betsey came along, with a rueful face. "Miss Ida--&#xD;
there's a dozen loaves of cake, and ever so many snow-balls wont&#xD;
get in the big sideboard, no how I"&#xD;
"Put them in the light closet, Miss ]~etsey. I hope we shall&#xD;
be able to eat it all !" she continued to e' girls.&#xD;
"Never fear I" said Emma. "You~ Richmond party could&#xD;
consume it in a week. How many are ~here ?"&#xD;
"Let me see I Arthur, Carry and n4y pet-three-Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Dana, three children and Charley-nine. They will be&#xD;
here to-morrow night-Ellen Morris, Monday or Tuesday. I&#xD;

-and oh! I gave Charley carte-bknickc to ask any of my~Rich-&#xD;
mond acquaintances-and all for what? To hear that Miss Ida&#xD;
Ross is -"&#xD;
"'Free, white, and twenty-one!"' sang Emma, cheerily.&#xD;
"Twenty-one! in four years, I shall be a spinster of a quarter&#xD;
of a century! Heigho 1" She said it jestingly; but ~at nightfall,&#xD;
she was pacing the porch alone-Laura having gone home, and&#xD;
Emma asleep, wearied by her day's activity; and the thought.&#xD;
returned to her. Twenty-one! the golden sands were slipping&#xD;
fast. The sky-meeting waves upon the horizon no longer blushed&#xD;
with sunset dyes, and nodded their bright crests, in luring&#xD;
welcome; her eyes were bent upon the regular swell of the&#xD;
Present, as she glided over it. The navigation of the unknown&#xD;
seas beyond, she trusted to the Pilot, who h~d engaged to see&#xD;
her safely to the desired haven. It was a holy, ~tifl hbur.&#xD;
Her swift step~ scarcely broke the silence-the firm, elastic&#xD;
tread of youth and health ;-and an unruffled spirit was within;&#xD;
-a fuiness of contentment and peace the world could not disturb&#xD;
or take away She had conned that invaluable lesson-" It is&#xD;
better to trust than to hope.~~&#xD;
"A letter ma'am-no papers," said Will, sententiously.&#xD;
"Thank you, uncle Will. Tell . James to bring a lamp into&#xD;
the parlor, if you please. I almost dread to open this !" she&#xD;
said to herself. "My fears are always on the alert,. to forebode&#xD;
e~'vil to those I love. I will be courageous-will have faith I"&#xD;
and she walked resolutely into the lighted room. But the super-&#xD;
scription sent a tremor to her heart-a minute elapsed before&#xD;
she opened it.&#xD;
THE LETTER.&#xD;
"I have come home alone, dear friend, leaving our Annie&#xD;
asleep in a foreign land. Her' day of suffering closed irx ease&#xD;
and peace; her "good* night" was as calm, as though she were&#xD;

to inform you of my bereavement, and solicit the sympathy&#xD;
none ever ask in vain from you. I was interrupted to read a&#xD;
communication which has changed~not the tenor of this alone,&#xD;
but the current of all~ my anticipations. It was from Miss&#xD;
Arnold; an annulment of the contract between us; a step, she&#xD;
says, foreseeu from an early period of our engagement, then she&#xD;
discovered that the heart, she thought she had surrendered to&#xD;
me, was wholly another's. I omit much that would be uninte-&#xD;

and when the owner of her heart sued for her hand, she pledged&#xD;
it, and asked for a release from herpievious vow I have no&#xD;

certain particulars, to make clear the explanation which follows.&#xD;

Ding of our intercourse, until my conviction of your betrothal,&#xD;
were correct exponents of my feelings. I cannot deny that&#xD;
when compelled to acknowledge the uselessness of my efforts, I&#xD;
judged you harshly-was tempted to believe you an unprincipled&#xD;

"Not a word had escaped me which Friendship might not&#xD;
have dictated; and your manner to me was less confidingly&#xD;
affectionate than to Charley. You regarded me as a brother;&#xD;
and if in that capacity, any act or word of mine could conduce&#xD;
to your happiness it should not be withheld. Y2ur committal&#xD;
of your lover's cause to me was a powerful appeal to every&#xD;
generous feeling. I solemnly resolved then, that you should&#xD;
never regret your implicit trust. At his death-bed, my thought&#xD;
was for you and him; 'at his grave, as I upheld ~~our sinking&#xD;
form-my heart answering the hearings of yours, in our common&#xD;
sorrow-I renewed the promise never to desecrate the purity of&#xD;
your friendship, by ~a breath of a love, demanding reciprocation&#xD;
in that which had gone down with him into the tomb. In this&#xD;
illusion, I came home. You know whom I met here; and that&#xD;
her surpassing loveliness, her apparent artlessness and amiability&#xD;
captivated us all. Annie loved her fervently, i~nd threw us&#xD;
together by many innocent manoeuvres-Dear girl! it was the&#xD;
blameless impulse of a loving heart-to unite two, who seemed&#xD;
to her hopeful perceptions to be destined for each other.. I was&#xD;
amused at her fancy-then uneasy, lest it should be a restriction&#xD;
upon Miss Arnold's kindly feelings for the brothel~ of her friend.&#xD;
I could not wound Annie by reproof or caution; so, after a&#xD;
while, decrying in Miss Arnold's demeanor, a touch of the&#xD;
dreaded embarrassment, I introduced the subject in a tone of&#xD;
light badinage. I may not describe the interview ;-my senti-&#xD;
ments and bearing had been utterly misconstrued. She did not&#xD;
express this in words, but her perturbation was unmistakable. I&#xD;
reflected upon this unlooked-for disclosure with no enviable&#xD;
emotions. I was free; no hope ventured to point to you; and I&#xD;
might learn to love the beautiful, tender creature, whom I had&#xD;
unintentionally deceived. In honour-in conscience--in huma-&#xD;
nity-what could I do, but tell her that, ~although not offering&#xD;
the deep tenderness of a first love I would cherish her as faith-&#xD;
fully, if not as fondly, as man ever did the woman he wooed&#xD;
and won? I cannot dwell upon the untold anguish of the moment&#xD;
when the fallacy- of my impressions and reasoning was exposed.&#xD;
The tempter was at my ear. Violation of my plighted word-&#xD;
the downfall of her hopes were nothing! the barrier which&#xD;

Mu. Grant, wife and sister-in-law were "dear, nice old folks,'~&#xD;
who liked to see young people enjoy themselves, prim and staid&#xD;
'though they were; and they had their fill of delight, that&#xD;
important Saturday; for three merrier mad-caps Sunnybank&#xD;
never held. Ida was the ringleader in the mirthful frolic.&#xD;
"She's so pleased 'cause Mars' Charles is comm'," said&#xD;
Rachel, in a pretended "aside" to Emz~ia and Laura; and Ida&#xD;
laughed, instead of reproving the gratuitous explanation. "I do&#xD;
want to see Charley-Bless him !" said she.&#xD;
"Is he a very dear friend.?" asked Laura.&#xD;
" Yer.y dear 1" Ida emphasized as strongly ;-" almost on a.&#xD;
par with Carry. We will have fun while he is here ;" and she&#xD;
launched into a recital of some of his freaks and stories; elicit-&#xD;
ing bursts 'of merriment from her listeners, which pealed even&#xD;
to the door of Miss Betsey's room, and hurried Mrs. Grant down&#xD;
stairs, "to hear what the~ joke was." The girls were upon the&#xD;
carpet in the middle of the large parlor, cutting pink and white&#xD;
paper roses. The graceful running cedar, they were to enliven,&#xD;
draped the walls, and hid the tarnished mouldings of the old&#xD;
portrait frames ;-geraniums and mignionette breathed sweetly&#xD;
through the parted muslin curtains; but nothing was so fair in&#xD;
the dame's eyes as the centre group. Laura was a brunette-.&#xD;
black eyes, nectarine bloom and pouting rosy lips-.the hand-&#xD;
somest of the trio; Emma's dove-like eyes, classic oval face and&#xD;
varying cQmpleXiOJl placed her next. Ida sat between them,&#xD;
speaking with much animation of voice and action-.-the glee of&#xD;
a child, and the modulations of a. clever elocutionist.&#xD;
"Well 1" said Mrs. Grant, when the narration was ended, "if&#xD;
you all aint a happy set, I'll' give up my judgment 1"&#xD;
"Don't do that, I beg!" said Ida. "We need it this minute,&#xD;
to tell us whether to mix these roses in the wreaths, or to dress&#xD;
this room with white ones, and the dining-room with pink."&#xD;
Mrs. Grant set her head to one side, and her hand upon her&#xD;

hip. It was a serious question. " Well, I don't know exactly-.&#xD;
.Either way's very pretty. .What do y~.ou say ?"&#xD;
u"Oh ! but we agreed to leave it to you. White ones look&#xD;
best by lamplight."&#xD;
" So they do I Well 'spose you put them in here, as the&#xD;
party meets in the parlor."&#xD;
" Thank you, mna'am. I am of the same opinion myself."&#xD;
" And I"-" and I" -said the others; and Mrs. Grant,&#xD;
pleased at having, for once, in her life, expressed a decided&#xD;
opinion, " reckoned Becky and Molly wouldn't beat them beds&#xD;
half enough if she didn't follow them up."&#xD;
The impromptu "rose case," upon which Emma and Laura&#xD;
* rallied Ida, was finished before dinner; and resolving themselves&#xD;
into a " committee of inspection," they visited every room in&#xD;
a body, with Miss Betsey and Mrs. Grant as re r guard. Even&#xD;
the wainscotted chambers were cheerful-snow drifts of beds-&#xD;
and windowr-hangings lined with pink--stainles~ toilette covers;&#xD;
painted bouquets upon the fire-screens, and rea4 ones upon the&#xD;
dressing-tables.     ,\      .-&#xD;
" Sunnybank deserves its name to-day,' said I~mma, leading&#xD;
Ida to a window-.&#xD;
The October sun was everywhere; plating with the laughing&#xD;
cascade which fell over the rock, at the fobt of the sloping lawn;&#xD;
carpeting the forest with tesselated gold; and the sheen of Ida's'&#xD;
pine-grove was as of millions of burnished needles-.&#xD;
" It is brighter here !" said Ida, laying her friend's hand&#xD;
upon her breast. .&#xD;
" 4You need not say so ;-your smile shows it. It is like&#xD;
sunshine itself."&#xD;
" Shall I tell her ?" thought Ida. "Not yet ! he will be here&#xD;
in a few days-and then !"--and the heart-bound threw the&#xD;
blood, in a scarlet gush to her cheeks-.&#xD;
Love like hers is never selfish. When they were separating&#xD;
to dress, she called Laura into' her room. Two dresses-a&#xD;
rose-coloured chall4, and a white muslin were upon the 'bed.&#xD;
" No thanks, dear !" she said, as the delighted creature clasped&#xD;
her arms about her neck, in speechless gratitude. "You, who&#xD;
do $so much fcor me and mine, deserve some token of regard,.&#xD;
&#xD;
864&#xD;
&#xD;
What ! tears ! Dry them instantly, and try your dresses. Ah !&#xD;
-they fit ! I thought we were nearly the same size,-so had&#xD;
them cut by my patterns. Emma ! step in here ! Are we not&#xD;
proud of our pupil ?"&#xD;
" She does not require fine robes to win praise from me,"&#xD;
said Emma. " How handsome and becoming ! just. hat one&#xD;
might expect from the donor."&#xD;
u"She is the best,;dearest friend I have"-began La ra, smil-&#xD;
ing through her tears.&#xD;
" Hush I" said Ida, threateningly. "Flatterers! both of you !&#xD;
be' off and ' beautify' as Charley says. ,And Laura--do you&#xD;
hear ? don't have eyes and dress to match ! a contrast is better."&#xD;
The main part of Sunnybank house was capped by   sort of&#xD;
belvidere, accessible by steps from the garret. Why it ad been&#xD;
built was one of Ida's childish studies; and the aequii ition of&#xD;
other knowledge was no help to the elucidation of this mystery.&#xD;
Emma said the founder of 'the mansion had an 'astronomical&#xD;
turn, 'and used it as an observatory ;-Laura, that it was a&#xD;
belfry, from which the alarm-bell was, sounded to collect .the&#xD;
surrounding settlers, when an incursion was made by the sava-&#xD;
Sges; Ida's more matter-of-fact belief was that her ancester had&#xD;
more fondness than taste for ornamental architecture, and so~&#xD;
planned this tuft to the conical crown of his habitation. On the&#xD;
birth-night, this was to be illuminated; the brackets were pre-&#xD;
pared, and some of the candles in the sockets. Nearer and faster&#xD;
-descended the darkness. Aunt Judy fidgeted from the kitchen&#xD;
to the house, and from the house to the kitchen, ini mortal fear&#xD;
for the credit of her supper. Miss Betsey prognosticated upset-&#xD;
tings and wheel-breakings, and "hoped the horses were sure-&#xD;
footed. That hill, the other side of Tim's Creek Was awful of&#xD;
a dark night."'&#xD;
. ,"I say, girls !" exclaimed Ida, " we will light the belvidere !&#xD;
They can see it six miles off. Anything but idle waiting I"&#xD;
-She was to stand in the yard, and direct the disposition of the&#xD;
lights-Laura, Emma and.Will, who thought no whim of his&#xD;
"mistis" absurd, ascended to the roof. The breeze was at rest;j&#xD;
and the rays shot forth, clear and straight, down the' avenue,&#xD;

magnifying the proportions of the fantastic roof. The others&#xD;
came out to admire the effect with her.&#xD;
"Hist I" said she. "Music 1"&#xD;
But there was not a sound.&#xD;
" I heard it-I know 1" said she, positively. Come into the&#xD;
porch."&#xD;
Another note was repeated by the hills. "I said so! they&#xD;
are coming-singing! isn't that like Charley 7" She distin.&#xD;
guished voices as they approached ;-Carry's soft alto; Mrs.&#xD;
Dana's soprano,-" Arthur-yes! that is his tenor-and Mr.&#xD;
Dana and Charley have the base !"&#xD;
"TI~e tune changes !" said Emma. "Auld Lang Syne-oh!&#xD;
how skeet I"&#xD;
Ida' eyes were streaming,-her h~art aching with joy. The&#xD;
carriag~s-two----and a buggy, drove ~ip to the door; and with a&#xD;
scream ~of. rapture she lifted Carry to ~'the ground,-not knowing&#xD;
who came next-~--only that they were all there. All! no ! where&#xD;
was Charley? She stopped upon th~ steps; ~lle holdingto her&#xD;
4ress; one hand in Carry's, the otherlupon her guardian's arm.&#xD;
"Charley! where' a~e you 7"&#xD;
"Here 1" with a ~uuster-roll intonation. He raised ~ her&#xD;
fingers to his lips-.-~n unprecedented action with him~ nd&#xD;
holding them still, locked over his shoulder. "Here is a ken-&#xD;
tleman who is afraid you will shut your doors upon him, for&#xD;
coming without a special invitation.&#xD;
"Mr. Germaine I" thought Ida, fearfully ;-but his was not&#xD;
the figure that emerged from the shade,-nor the warm grasp, in&#xD;
which Charley, with a movement' full of grace and feeling, placed&#xD;
her hand ;-nor his the voice that said-" I do not doubt her&#xD;
hospitality, ~but my deserts."&#xD;
"Do you forget your friends, that 'you expect a similar fate,&#xD;
Mr. Lacy ?" said Ida.&#xD;
His actual presence was the roseleaf upon the mantling cup&#xD;
of bliss. It did not overflow ;-tumultuating passions were stilled&#xD;
into a calm, delicious ecstacy. She was more composed than&#xD;
she had been at any time since the reading of the letter,-saw&#xD;
everything, tlionght of eve~.ybody. Carry and Emma went up&#xD;
stairs a~m in arm, 'and Ida, her baby namesake, folded to her&#xD;
&#xD;
'Fierce and high&#xD;
The death-pile Wazed into the sky,&#xD;
And far away, o'er rook and flood,&#xD;
Its melancholy radiance sent!"'&#xD;
"Was I the only rhapsodizer ?" retorted Charley.&#xD;
said, when a figure passed before the light.-.L.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Who&#xD;
&#xD;
'lEafed, like a vision, stood&#xD;
Revealed before the burning pyre,&#xD;
Tall, shadowy, like a Spirit of Fire,&#xD;
Shrined in its own grand element?"'&#xD;
"Why, that was uncle Will !" exclaimed Emma.&#xD;
Amid the burst of laughter that replied, Charley pronounced&#xD;
poetry-..-" done."&#xD;
"And~ having descended to real life, perhaps you do not object&#xD;
to more substantial food," said Ida. ~On the way to the house,&#xD;
some one took her hand.&#xD;
"Has my impatience offended? I could not wait !" said a&#xD;
hasty whisper.&#xD;
"Am I welcome ?"&#xD;
"In every sense of the word," was the ingenuous response&#xD;
This was their lighting.&#xD;
The sun was n~t up, when Ida raised the parlor windows next&#xD;
morning. Above the dun zone of forest, rested another, of'&#xD;
silvery grey vapor, and higher, legions of fleecy cloudlets, from&#xD;
&#xD;
heart, was following Mrs. .Dana, when she recollected Launt.&#xD;
She was standing, alone and overlooked, in the hall.&#xD;
"Here, Laura! I confide my darling to your keeping.&#xD;
Gently! don't wake her. Is she not a lovely bab~e ?"&#xD;
"Beautiful!" said Laura, in proud gratification.&#xD;
The sleepy children' suppers were brought up, and they&#xD;
were snug in bed before their elders were prepared for their&#xD;
meal. The gentlemen were in the yard, looking at the belvedere.&#xD;
"Your beacon puzzled us considerably," said Charley to Ida.&#xD;
"It appeared to be upon the summit of a huge, shapeless height.&#xD;
We thought we had lost our road and wandered off to the,&#xD;
Enchanted Mountains."&#xD;
"Or that a remnant of Ghebers had an asylum alnc~n~ these&#xD;
hills," said Mr. Lacy. "You should h~ve heard' Charley's&#xD;

all parts of the heavens, hung motionless, as angels may hover,&#xD;
in rapt adoration, over, the crystal walls of the New Jerusalem.&#xD;
He arose I the "bridegroom of earth and brother of time I" and&#xD;
her simile changed-as assuming roseate and golden robes, the&#xD;
ekpectant host wove themselves into a gorgeous causeway, by&#xD;
which he. seemed to mount the heavens. So "Jesus left the&#xD;
dead I" the Sun of Righteousness burst His prison gates; and&#xD;
the shining ones sang the consummation of a world's redemp-&#xD;
tion. She was reading her Bible, alternately with the resplendent&#xD;
leaf Nature unfurled this autumnal Sabbath, when a step dis-&#xD;
pelled her trance.&#xD;
"Good morning I" said Mr. Lacy. "You are an early riser~"&#xD;
"There is my reward I" pointing to the scene without.&#xD;
"May I participate, in virtue of my. second-best claim ?" asked&#xD;
he, with hi~ own beaming s~nile, seating himself before she&#xD;
assented. Ida's trifling embarrassment was transient. His beha-&#xD;
viour, open and free, as of old, had not a tincture of reserve, or&#xD;
significance to indicate that he thought of their new relation.&#xD;
The beauty of our lower sanctuary; the upper, which it dimly&#xD;
shadows fprth; Annie's sickness and death; the Christian's&#xD;
work and hopes-were the, matter of their conversation; and as&#xD;
the rest assembled, they were spared the disagreeable sensation&#xD;
one feels at' interrupting a t~te-Ii-t&amp;amp;e.&#xD;
"Is it time to ring the prayer-bell, Ida 7" asked Emma, as the&#xD;
last loiterer came in.&#xD;
"I' think so. We breakfast early on Sunday mornings7 that&#xD;
we may be at school in season," she said to-Mrs~ Dana.&#xD;
It was her practice to lead in family worship, night and morn-&#xD;
ing. Arthur had performed this office the evening before, and&#xD;
the servants having collected in the hall, she motioned him to&#xD;
the stand, where hy the Bible.&#xD;
"I am hoarse," he said. "Lacy I"&#xD;
The person addressed reddened slightly, but conquering him&#xD;
self instantly, did as he was requested; and Ida, too,, although&#xD;
riot so easily, lost the identity of the man in the reader, and&#xD;
was prepared to join, with solemnity and fervor of spirit, in his&#xD;
prayer.&#xD;
By Vhahl.e/4 contrivance, they rode to church in the light&#xD;

buggy. Ida'condeinned herself for the feeling of disappointment&#xD;
that fell suddenly upon her, as the school-house appeared; and&#xD;
more for the fancies which strayed-starry-winged butterflies&#xD;
into the machinery of her morning's duties; but her pupils were&#xD;
unconsciouS of the visitants.&#xD;
"Is that your regular pastor ?" inquired Mr~ Lacy, as they&#xD;
were driving back.,&#xD;
"Jr-regular, rather-if you speak of the seasons of his minis-&#xD;
trations. Presiding over three-I am not certain it is not four&#xD;
congregations, he preaches for us once a month."&#xD;
"Who officiates the three other Sabbaths ?"&#xD;
"Sometimes the pastor of the Hill-side church. The second&#xD;
Sabbath is his day in course; but he lives twelve miles off. If&#xD;
he is among the missing, we catch up a ,ircuit-rider, or go ser-&#xD;
monless."&#xD;
"' These things ought not so to be."'&#xD;
"I know it-but they are! Who is to remedy them? Palm-&#xD;
branch is a free church."&#xD;
"And as often free of preachers, as of sectarianism, it seems,"&#xD;
said he.&#xD;
"More frequently. The war of polemic debate is waged as&#xD;
furiously there, as if the controversialists owned pulpit, pews&#xD;
and people. The number of communicants of our persuasion,&#xD;
in this neighborhood, is small; yet they are mostly persons in&#xD;
good circumstances, and able to have a church of their own, if&#xD;
they would think so."&#xD;
"They should purchase this Palm-branch. There is more&#xD;
euphony than meaning in that name, when applied to a house."&#xD;
"A free church, especially," answered Ida. "However, our&#xD;
Sabbath-school has vanquished its enemies, and may lead the&#xD;
church on to victory."&#xD;
"Dr. Hall awards the merits of this enterprise to you. Has&#xD;
your residence h~re enlarged or contracted your sphere of useful-&#xD;
ness ?"&#xD;
"Enlarged it. Not that this would be the case with most&#xD;
people. The city presents more facilities for benevolence gene.&#xD;
rally; but my family had influence here; and my servants&#xD;
wanted a manager. There are more deprivations than I antici-&#xD;

the dearth of books and intellectual recreations; and last and&#xD;
worst-abridgement of my church privileges. Still 1 do not&#xD;
repent my removal. My happiest days have been my Sunny-&#xD;
bank life."&#xD;
"Because you are in your right orbit. The evils you recount&#xD;
are not irremedia~ile; we will discuss them at length, some day."&#xD;
This was the only reference to the future, as theirs-into&#xD;
which he was betrayed all day; but it struck Idt~ dumb. She&#xD;
recovered her speech by evening; for she and Charhy strolled in&#xD;
* the garden, in close converse, until ~Mr. Dana sent Morton to&#xD;
warn them of the night dew. He perceived, as did the whole&#xD;
party, traces of emotion in her countenance; and Charley was&#xD;
very grave, although not melancholy. Music was proposed&#xD;
after tea; and Ida unlocked the parlor organ, a gift to Mrs.&#xD;
* Ross from her husband, and still a fine instrument. ~Emma&#xD;
bhmshed so deeply at her nomination as organist, that Ida recalled&#xD;
the motion and occupied her accustomed place. Her fingers&#xD;
wandered; and Mr. Lacy, bending over to adjust the book, said&#xD;
softly, "Do not attempt to play, if you are indisposed." She&#xD;
smiled. '~I am only weak and silly; I shall be better directly."&#xD;
And ere the first hymn was concluded her clear voice led the&#xD;
choristers, and the pealing chords rolled out in full strength and&#xD;
harmony.&#xD;
The bell rang for prayers. Arthur glanced at Ida, and was&#xD;
arrested in the act of rising, by seeing her wheel a chair to the&#xD;
stand, and beckon t6 Charley. Yet more astounded were all&#xD;
that he took it. Unclasping the Bible, he read distinctly and&#xD;
reverently, a portion of its sacred contents; and they knelt with&#xD;
him at the mercy-seat. A stifled sob, and more, than one' sigh&#xD;
from surcharge bosoms, responded to his petitions; and Carry&#xD;
wept aloud at the "Amen." Arthur was equally moved. "God&#xD;
bless you, Charley 1" was all he could say, as he wrung his hand.&#xD;
"He /ia8 blessed him, and us," said Morton, joyfully. "I&#xD;
thought this would be the end of it, my good friend 1"&#xD;
"Not.the end-the beginning !" said Ida, who, stood by her&#xD;
adopted brother. "Only~ the beginning! is it not, Charley ?"&#xD;
"Iin~ were the beginning !" said he, smiling. "My mind&#xD;
&#xD;
has been made i~p for some time.; but it was proper that she&#xD;
should be the first apprised &amp;amp;f it. I was stubborn and rebellious;&#xD;
and the consistent practice of one private Christian did more to&#xD;
convict me than the preaching of the entire apostolic succession&#xD;
-Saints Paul and Peter to head them-could have done."&#xD;
"0, Charley! you are Charley still I" laughed Carry.&#xD;
"And always will be, I hope!" rejoined Morton. "Religion,&#xD;
my dear Mrs. Dana, does not make but mend, the dispositon."    9&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
YES! "Charley was Charley still " The brothers were walk-&#xD;
ing the piazza, Monday morning; and John's' smile and&#xD;
Arthur's laugh applauded the quaint humor which came from&#xD;
his lips, as freely as respiration of the air his lungs had inhaled.&#xD;
He was a consummate actor; and his self-command balked the&#xD;
sharpest scrutiny when he chose; but his spirits, this morning,&#xD;
were not feigned. Mrs. Dana, Emma and Laura made their&#xD;
appearance, and at length, Charley's flow of talk could no&#xD;
longer delay the' inquiry "Where are Ida and Mr. Lacy ?"&#xD;
"'Brushing the dew upon the upland lawn."' said Charley.&#xD;
"Gone to ride.".&#xD;
"When did they start ?" .asked John.&#xD;
"Just as you shut your eyes for a second nap.-~-.luxurious&#xD;
citizen that you are. 'When will they return ?'-.-query the&#xD;
second.-You will see them on the top of that hill in a minute."&#xD;
They cantered down the avenue in gallant style. Ida was&#xD;
an expert rider; and her escort appeared to as much advantage&#xD;
on horseback as on foot.&#xD;
"A handsome couple I" said Arthur.&#xD;
Charley made no reply. "You do your teacher justice," he&#xD;
eaid, as Ida leaped to the ground, barely touching Mr. Lacy's&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"And more could not be said for master or pupil ;" she&#xD;
answered, saucily.&#xD;
"Morning rides are wonderful cosmetics!" he whispered, fol-&#xD;
lowing her into the hail. She snapped her whip at hirn,~ but&#xD;
those mischievous eyes were too searching, and she ran off "to&#xD;
change her dress."&#xD;
"I am for a walk to the river. Who accompanies me ?" said&#xD;
John Dana. Ida held the taper at which he was kindling&#xD;
a cigar-his invariable after-breakfast luxury-and the flame&#xD;
was paled by her vivid glow, as Mr. Lacy said quietly, "I will,&#xD;
sir, with pleasure."&#xD;
&#xD;
872&#xD;

A L O N E .&#xD;
&#xD;
In an hour they returned, and the summons-" Mr. Dana's&#xD;
respects, and if you please ma'am, he wants the pleasure of&#xD;
your company in the drawing-room," robbed her of the last&#xD;
spark of self-posses~ion. She stopped at the door, to muster&#xD;
courage; but her guardian had heard her step, and opened it&#xD;
from within. "I have no lecture for you," he said, passing&#xD;
his arm assuringly around her. "Tliis is an event, we fathers&#xD;
have to bear, as best we may. I am fortunate that your choice.&#xD;
has my unqualified sanction. You have acted wisely, nobly, my&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"Dear Mr. Dana! I feared you would think me uncommuni~&#xD;
native; but I did not know it myself until within a day or two."&#xD;
"I am advised of the incidents of your drama. Never try&#xD;
to convince me again, that you are an unromantic young lady I&#xD;
What is your evidence, Mr. Lacy ?"&#xD;
She had not seen, until this speech, that he was present. She&#xD;
bestowed 6ne look upon him, and the magnetic charzri of his&#xD;
smile equalized her nerves and thoughts. Mr. Dana would&#xD;
have left the room, but Morton stayed him. In succinct and&#xD;
manly terms, he thanked him for the expression of an esteem,&#xD;
it should be the study of his life to merit. . ." I am aware, sir,&#xD;
that it is arrant b~Adnes~ to ask more from sour kindness; but&#xD;
you engaged to in~rcede~~or me in another. suit." Ida looked&#xD;
up, hurriedly. The gentlemen smiled; and Mr. Lacy whispered&#xD;
a sentence in her ear.&#xD;
"Oh no! no 1" she ejaculated, "too soon I"&#xD;
"Why 'too soon?' " It was John Dana, who drew her away&#xD;
from her lover, and pushed back the shadowing curls from her&#xD;
forehead. "Think of Mr. Lacy and myself as old friends, and&#xD;
speak. out the language of your own warm heart4 Why 'too&#xD;
soon,' Ida? Don't you know him'well, enough ?"&#xD;
Another glance was the signal for another smile.&#xD;
"Will you ever know him better ?" asked Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"I think not," she replied.&#xD;
"You don't like him. well enough, then ?" pursued Mr. Dana.&#xD;
The curls dropped over her face, and she was mute.&#xD;
"Perhaps you do not like the idea of resigning your freedom&#xD;
the very day you gain it ?"&#xD;

"Carry-Arthur--Mrs. Dana-Charley-all of them."&#xD;
"Charley has been my abeltor from the beginning. From&#xD;

when the clamour of amazement lulled, not a hand was raised&#xD;
in the negative.&#xD;
"She deserves the best husband that can be given her;" said&#xD;
Carry, "and from my knowledge of Mr. Lacy's character I&#xD;

Charley will not make a match."&#xD;
"Ah, Jenny! did I not say you would have to abandon that&#xD;
air castle 7" said her husband. "It was the only essay at&#xD;
match-making I ever caught you at."&#xD;
"Wbat is it, Laura ?" inquired Carry, as her face brig1~it-&#xD;
ened suddenly.&#xD;
"I was thinking how strange we should have decorated the&#xD;
drawing-room with white roses, when we were not expecting&#xD;
a wedding 1"&#xD;
The news spread like wild-fire over the plantation. "Young&#xD;
Mistis was gwine to be married !" and never did tidings of a&#xD;
splendid Victory produce a grander jubilee. The Grants, Miss&#xD;
]3etsey, and Will, as sub-steward, had the programme of the&#xD;
performances and actors; but with the crowd, the Lacy' and&#xD;
Dana factions ran high,' to the amusement of the wise. 'Aunt&#xD;
Judy's climax was reported at the dinner-table by Miss Bet8ey,&#xD;
who must have shared in the general delirium of pleasure, as&#xD;
this is the only authentic record of her ever having spoken in&#xD;
"company," unless "spoken to."&#xD;
"'Well!' says Aunt Judy-says she-..-.' Dany or Lacy-they's&#xD;
both mighty fine, pretty-spoken gentlemen. Either on 'em '11&#xD;
do; but it's been a-runnin' in n~y head what a inussiful Provi-&#xD;

nicer than any I'se made since' ole Marster's wedding! And&#xD;

ordered wonderful! wonderful!'"&#xD;
"Don't blush, Ida! laughing suits the occasion better,"' said&#xD;
Carry, as every mouth spread at this apropos anecdote; and she&#xD;
did laugh merrily, as well as Mr. Lacy, who had tried to control&#xD;
his risibles until he heard her.&#xD;
Ellen' Morris arrPved that night, attended by her brother, and&#xD;
at a feminine council, which sat until midnight, in the room of&#xD;
the bride-elect, a list of attendants was drawn up-Emma and&#xD;
Charley, Laura and Mr. Latham, Ellen and Mr. Thornton, who,&#xD;
she said, was certainly coming next day,-and /Miss Ki~gston,&#xD;
~ne of the neighbors, with Robert Morris.&#xD;

said Emma. "Who thought of this, a week ago? and here&#xD;
everything is arranged, as if expressly for a marriage. 'Not a&#xD;
screw loose or lacking!'"&#xD;
"Ida will say it is a 'special Providence,' ",said Mrs. Dana,&#xD;
"but Mr. Lacy and Charley had a hand in it."&#xD;
"Who moved them ?" asked Ida. "Depend~ upon it, my&#xD;
theory is irrefutable, because true. If a decision, it is harm-&#xD;
less and pleasant."&#xD;
"You would make puppets of us;" said Ellen. "Chessmen-&#xD;
irresponsible for their motions."&#xD;
"No md&#xD;
no matter how We are children, obeying a Father's orders,&#xD;
enigmatical; and having done our part, letting&#xD;
Him work out the answer to the puzzle. A so-called ignorant&#xD;
woman once furnished th~'4est definition of' Faith I ever heard;&#xD;
taking the Lord at his word.' It is safer to believe, than&#xD;
to argue, Ellen."&#xD;
~~~Aunt Judy's aphorism ~was bandied about on Tuesday until&#xD;
was hacknied. Ida feared the appearance of, her "Bubly&#xD;
Jock ;" but her prime counsellor, Will, his stalwart arms bared&#xD;
to the shoulder, to turn an ice-cream churn, said confidently, that'&#xD;
"she nor Miss Laura should be pestered with him that evening.&#xD;
I've got his written bond to stay at home, and eat the supper&#xD;
that will be sent to him. Mars' Charley and Mr. Lacy's been&#xD;
to see hin~ too. They came while I was there, 'on a sociable&#xD;
visit,' they said, but before they went \away, he was crying like&#xD;
a child-they talked so beautiful !"&#xD;
The bridal paraphernalia was laid i~i array, and Emma and&#xD;
Laura tying up bouquets; Ida directir~g, but not permitted to&#xD;
assist.&#xD;
"Ellen cannot fir~d that arbor-vit~e surely I" said Emma. "I&#xD;
wish she had let me go !"&#xD;
Ellen burst into the room, and flinging herself' into a chair,&#xD;
laughed immoderately. "What has happened ?" cried a trio of&#xD;
voices.&#xD;
"The wheel of luck has turned! It is a 'wonderful ordering'&#xD;
that brings Josephine Read 'upon this, of all days in the year !"&#xD;
i~ J~~phine 1" Ida seemed to behiAd a ghoul§ She had&#xD;
invited her because propriety demanded she should not slight&#xD;
&#xD;
the daughter of her former guardian, after living in the house&#xD;
with her six years; then she was fond of Anna Talbot, and a&#xD;
separate invitation was not to be thought of. The possibility ot&#xD;
her coming had not entered her mind. How could she present&#xD;
herself at the door of' her~ whom she had denounced as her&#xD;
mortal foe? Emma stood aghast, and Laura in bewilderment, at&#xD;
the dismay depicted in the* faces of her friends.&#xD;
"I am sorry for you, Ida," continued Ellen; "and if I were&#xD;
a magician, would whisk her off to Guinea in the time it would&#xD;
take me to say 'Presto!' but if you did not feel so badly, I&#xD;
would delight in her spiteful rage, when she knows that she&#xD;
has come to your wedding-.-aud with Mr.. Lacy! Oh! it is&#xD;
transporting 1"&#xD;
"Worse and worse I" said Ida, sorrowfully. "Unkind, as she&#xD;
has been, I would not wound her; &amp;amp;nd she will never be per-&#xD;
suaded that the insult was unpremeditated."&#xD;
"' Insult!' forsooth! who is insulted, pray, but yourself, by&#xD;
the intrusion of a woman, who has reviled and backbitten you,&#xD;
until the town cried oi~t against her evil tongue! Oh! the&#xD;
shamelessness of wicked gossip 1"&#xD;
"Where is s " questioned Ida.&#xD;
"In the north chamber. Anna Talbot, Messrs. Thornton and&#xD;
Villet came with her."&#xD;
"Charley said he asked them-and I am glad Anna is here-&#xD;
but oh! Josephine! and I am e~i disl&amp;amp;abiile! Emma, will you&#xD;
run up to them? you are at home."&#xD;
"Willingly." The kind-hearted girl emptied her lap . of~ the&#xD;
flowers.&#xD;
"And explain everything," ~said Ida.     -&#xD;
"Yes-make all right! Comfort yourself ;" and away&#xD;
she flew.&#xD;
Her face, upon her re-entrance, boded well for Ida's hopes.&#xD;
"What did she say ?" inquired the latter, anxiously.&#xD;
"They were unpacking their trunks. A~ na was very cordiaJ&#xD;
-so was Josephine-for her. 'We concluded yesterday, to&#xD;
come up,' said Anna. 'Pa made a point of it, and Ida's letter&#xD;

"'And Mr. Thornton and M. Violet were so desirous to have&#xD;
some Richmond girls here;' said Josephine."&#xD;
"Aba I" interrupted Ellen.&#xD;
Emma continued. "Anna did not notice her remark. 'The&#xD;
maid tells me Ida is to be married;' she said, eagerly. 'What a&#xD;
trick she has played us!' 'The queerest part of the story is, that&#xD;
she is more surprised than any body else,' I answered-' They&#xD;
hate not been engaged a week! You know the groom?"'&#xD;
"'0 yes! he is a noble fellow! I am rejoiced she is to&#xD;
marry him at last.'"&#xD;
"And what did Josephine say to this ?" asked the inquisitive&#xD;
Ellen. "You need not pretend~you have told us all."&#xD;
"Oh! nothing of consequence. She spoke very carelessly,-&#xD;
of his ~' being nothing extra,' and 'she is welcome to him,' with&#xD;
no symptoms of unusual malice."&#xD;
'~ Maybe she does not care now, having transferred her atten-&#xD;
tions to Mr. Thornton. That harp will hang upon the willow,&#xD;
too, or my name is not. Ellen Morris !"&#xD;
A note was handed Ida.&#xD;
"' 'Ossa on Pelion piled!' from your countenance," said the&#xD;
volatile bridesmaid. ~ I&#xD;
Ida read it aloud. "VilIet is~ with Thornton. Will your&#xD;
plans undergo any alteration in consequence?&#xD;
M. L."&#xD;
"Josephine is the loose screw, Emma spoke of. I woi4d&#xD;
gladly add M. Villet and Anna to my train__"&#xD;
~' Do it, and let her fret !" exclaimed Ellen.&#xD;
"Oh, no!" said Emma, involuntarily.&#xD;
'~ I cannot !" said Ida. She wrote upon the reverse . of t~e&#xD;
bi1let-~" Unless you object, the original order will be preserved."&#xD;
There were-no happier beings present that evening, than t~ie&#xD;
acting host and hostess, an&amp;amp;Carry and Arthur.&#xD;
"I had resigned myself to Ida's perpetual spinsterdom," said&#xD;
Carry to her schoolmates. "She rejected several good offers from&#xD;
no apparent cause; and 1 imagined 'she had a prejudice against&#xD;
matrimony."&#xD;
"She was very indifferent upon the subject ;" said Anna.&#xD;
"She was a mystery to' many. But these deathless friendships&#xD;
&#xD;
betw n ladies and gentlemen, are always suspicious, and I pre-&#xD;
dicted how this one would end."&#xD;
"Charley is delighted ;" said Carry.&#xD;
"ills that surprising ?" a~ked Josephine, with a dash of irony.&#xD;
"Hush! Here they are 1" said Anna.&#xD;
The clergyman stepped into the centre of the room. The&#xD;
fourth couple entered first.&#xD;
"Only six attendan~ !" whispered Josephine, as Charley&#xD;
appeared in the doorway. A freezing night shut her in! through&#xD;
it she saw but two forms-a princely figure, his Antinous head&#xD;
erect in proud happiness-and the hated,. injured rival, to~whose&#xD;
*      house, curiosity and vanity had tempted her--the bridal veil&#xD;
falling in soft wreaths about her ;-his bride! his wife! for&#xD;
*      emulous groups flocked around them.&#xD;
"Oh! how could you deceive me so 7" cried Anna, catching&#xD;
Emma, as Charley led her up. "Mr. Dana! we thought you&#xD;
were the bridegroom! The servant said-.-' Mars' Charley Dana!'&#xD;
Didn't she, Josephine ?"&#xD;
The frozen lips thawed into a stiff "Yes."&#xD;
"Ah I how foolish in me to forget that Molly espoused the&#xD;
'Dana cause I"' said Emma.&#xD;
"And you believed the mistress would imitate the maid's&#xD;
example, Miss Anna 7" returned Charley. "Are you inconsola-&#xD;
ble that I am single yet?"&#xD;
'~ No! overjoyed! A change has come over my desperate&#xD;
spirit, since I discovered niy ~nistake. Come Josephine! we&#xD;
must congratulate them."&#xD;
Josephine was immovable. "I never pay congratulations.~~&#xD;
"For decency's sake !" Charley heard Anna say, angrily&#xD;
"Don't get into one of your surly humor tonight! Very&#xD;
well! stay where you are I" and she walked off with* M. Violet.&#xD;
"That sigh-what is its interpretation ?" asked Mr. Lacy, of&#xD;
Ida, as they were watching and enjoying the lively company,&#xD;
which had none of the stiffness usual to weddings.&#xD;
"Did I sigh? it was in thought-not in sadness, then."&#xD;
"So I hoped. What was the weighty reflection 7"&#xD;
"I, was running over the bridals and bridal-parties I have&#xD;

His Qhosen wife though she was,~she hung her head. He&#xD;
had to bend to hear the faint accents. " I received a letter from&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
THE stability of wedded happiness may be fairly tested in six&#xD;
years; and that number has elapsed since the wedding-eve at&#xD;
Sunnybank ;-a montI~ or two more-for hickory logs are&#xD;
heaped upon the carved andirons, and the arrowy blaze sheds a&#xD;
red glare upon a group of familiar faces :-Charley, unaltered,&#xD;
save that the benign lustre of his eye-formerly seen only by&#xD;
his best friends, has become habitual ;-Morton Lacy, hand-&#xD;
somer in the prime of manhood than as the slender student;&#xD;
and, her elbow resting on his knee, sits upon a low divan, his&#xD;
wife. If Time has dealt leniently with the others, he has acted&#xD;
repentantly towards her. She is younger, in face and manner,&#xD;
at twenty-seven, than she was at seventeen. Her husband's&#xD;
equal in many respects, and treated by him as such-she has&#xD;
never endured the servile subjugation of soul, which transforms&#xD;
intelligent women into inane, mindless machines. In yielding to&#xD;
his superior judgment, when in contrariety to hers, her will has&#xD;
parted with none of its strength in the bend which proved its&#xD;
pliancy. Submission is a pleasure, not a cross.&#xD;
"I read to-day of a Mr. Latham, called to the - street&#xD;
Church, Baltimore," says Charley. "Is it Emma's husband ?"&#xD;
"The identical personage 1" replies Ida, with pride. "A high&#xD;
compliment to so young a preacher 1"&#xD;
"He is a man of superior talents," pronounces Mr. Lacy;&#xD;
~'a divine of Ida's making."&#xD;
"Of Mr. Lacy's, you mean-and maybe, after all, the Sab-&#xD;
bath-school is entitled to the honor of teaching him that the&#xD;
healing of men's souls, not their bodies, was his vocation. Dr.&#xD;
H;dl and I had a pitched battle whenever we met, over our&#xD;
interference with his pupil, until his trial-sermon, which was&#xD;
delivered in our church. The Doctor strode across the aisle, at&#xD;
the close of the services, wiping his eyes. 'I forgive you,&#xD;
madam, and that meddling husband of yours! My stars! what&#xD;
a parson I was near spoiling 1'"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7999-00000192"/>&#xD;
"Does Miss Laura meet your wishes, as Mrs. Latham's sue&#xD;
cessor?'"&#xD;
"Entirely. Mr. Lacy supports he~r authority, or the stigwn&#xD;
attached to her father's memory woi~ld weaken her infiwm~.&#xD;
She looks sad to-night. It is the third anniversary of his&#xD;
miserable end.~r&#xD;
"He was burnt alive-was he not ?"&#xD;
"It is supposed so. He was found dead-his body partly&#xD;
consumed-.upon the hearth of his room. Probably he fell~ dowu&#xD;
in a drunken fit. The blow was almost too great for Laura's&#xD;
reason. Natural affection covered the remembrance of all his&#xD;
faults. The children were taken by their mother's relations, to&#xD;
whom he would not allow them to go, in his life-time. Laura&#xD;
has continued with us."&#xD;
"Still a passion for protegds! The last time I saw Miss&#xD;
Road, she inquired what your newest hobby was."&#xD;
"What did you reply ?" inquires Mr. Lacy.&#xD;
"That ladies dismissed hobbies, when they wei~e provided&#xD;
with 'hubbies-.-' an execrable play upon words, wh~ch she may&#xD;
'have construed int6 an ill-natured fling at her single..blessedness."&#xD;
"She ought~not. On dit that Ellen Morris has supplanted&#xD;
me in your bachelor friendship; and she is not likely to marry."&#xD;
"Any more than myself-but Ellen Morris i~ not Josephine&#xD;
Read. Old maids are a much-abused class of the community;&#xD;
I trust to her to redeem their character, but Josephine is a fright-&#xD;
ful counterpoise. If you had remained single !"&#xD;
"But I didn't !" says Ida, smiling archly at her liege, lord.&#xD;
"And you two have only. yourselves to blame."&#xD;
"And Lelia. Arnold I" subjoins Mr. Lacy, teasingly. "There&#xD;
is another enchanting spinster, Charley."&#xD;
Ida is grave.&#xD;
"You observe my wife nurses her jealousy yet."&#xD;
"I pity her, Morton! not for' losing you,-but I shall always&#xD;
think that she loved Richard Copeland as sincerely as it was in&#xD;
her nature to do."&#xD;
"Why dismiss him, then ?" queries Charley.&#xD;
"She had the credit of it. In my opinion, he made her&#xD;
&#xD;
882&#xD;
&#xD;
ALONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
discard Mi'. Lacy by threats or blandishments; then punished&#xD;
her perfidy to him and others by violating his engagement."&#xD;
"An unmanly act--but a just lesson! lie is marvelously&#xD;
improved by his marriagee. Was it a love-match ?"&#xD;
"I believe so. (Alice is a lovely girl; just the equable tem-&#xD;
perament t6 balan7~e his flightiI~ess. What a contrast to his&#xD;
sister !"&#xD;
"Has she taken the veil ?"&#xD;
"Alas! yes! She wrote to me, at her mother's death, that&#xD;
'having lost both parents, and her brother's marriage making&#xD;
him independent of her cares, she should devote the remnant of&#xD;
her sorrowful days to prayer and expiation of her sins-if peni-&#xD;
tence and mortification could atone.'"&#xD;
"1/, indeed !" says Mr. Lacy. "Yet she is more sinned&#xD;
against, than sinning. Her remorse, much as it misguided her,&#xD;
is more creditable than heir step-daughter's insensibility."&#xD;
'Poor Josephine !" sigh~ Ida.&#xD;
"Why 'poor?'" asks Oharley. ~L1You, of all people, have&#xD;
least cause to be sorry for her."&#xD;
"I have most, because I know her best. She is not happy-.&#xD;
never was-and never will be unless her heart is changed. I&#xD;
have not forgotten the misery of a part of my sojourn with her;&#xD;
yet I hQnestly preferred my qtato to hers."&#xD;
"You are very unlike."&#xD;
"Now, perhaps-and I thought we were then; but my&#xD;
mother's training was all that saved my disposition from adapt-&#xD;
ing itself to Mr. Read's mould. She had no talisman. I wish&#xD;
she had a, hundredth part of my happiness. A woman is so&#xD;
lonely without a home and friends! They are to us-t do not&#xD;
say to you-necessaries of life."&#xD;

"'Alone' reminds one of the 'Lamplighter;' but the former, if not more&#xD;
interesting, is more vigorous and individual. We recognize points in it which&#xD;
deserve high praise for their high merits. True genius alone, for instance,&#xD;
eould have conceived and. executed the scene between Lacy and Ida. The&#xD;
whole e1A~ode of the marriage of the widower with the young and fashionable&#xD;
Helen, is capitally given; and its final catastrophe is as thrilling as it is&#xD;
simple and natural. 'Chancy' is one of the best drawn people we have met&#xD;
with in print for many a day. Ida, herself-Carry, Josephine, nurse Rachel,&#xD;
Lynn Holmes, the artist, the Dana family-indeed almost everybody intro-&#xD;
duced, even to the merest sketch, are graphic and distinct. The book is full&#xD;

"We are prepared to endorse the high enconiums bestowed upon it by the&#xD;

authoress has made most valuable and entertaining contributions. She is&#xD;
known to the public as the writer of 'Robert Remer's' interesting letters,&#xD;
published some time ago in the Watchmanand Observer. This book is meet-&#xD;

"'Alone' is an excellent book. The characters are well drawn, the narra-&#xD;
tive felicitous, and the dialogues skilfully and spiritedly conducted. The plot&#xD;
is simple, the purpose good, and the lessons inculcated of the highest value.&#xD;
A religions' to'ne pervades the work. It has been read by us attentively from&#xD;

truly gifted authoress~ Whilst perusing its pages, the reader is forcibly&#xD;

the unmistakable impress of a~ highly-gifted mind, and is couched in a&#xD;

ward of a stern guardian, i~ a high-spirited, noble girl-just such a character&#xD;
as none but a true woman could draw. The other personages of the story&#xD;
are described with scarcely less intelligence, and with a degree of world-&#xD;
knowledge not often found in our lady authors. A very faithful and animated&#xD;
picture of society in the Old Dominion is presented in the successive 4~hap-&#xD;

"We are sincerely gratified at the favorable and highly-complimentary&#xD;
reception with which it has met at the hands, both of competent critics and'&#xD;
the public, not in Virginia alone, but throughout the country, North and&#xD;
South. It is destined, we believe, from the many flattering notices it has&#xD;
already received, to have a considerable 'run.' It amply deserves it. Its&#xD;
merits are of very high order, if disinterested professional critics are to be&#xD;
accounted competent judges. Both in its literary and typographical execu-&#xD;

clearness and 'originality; the plot developing naturally without startling&#xD;

* "A novel of uncommon excellence, certainly superior to any Virginia novel&#xD;
we recollect ever to have read, and affording gratifying promise of future&#xD;
success and distinction. The whole tone of the book denotes the refinement&#xD;
and pure-mindedness of the ~roung authoress. The pictures of Virginia&#xD;
country-life, with its amusements, exercises, and the habits and peculiarities&#xD;
of the people are faithfully and graphically sketched, and some of these&#xD;
sketches have all the~ freshness and softness of word pictures 'by our best&#xD;

"'Alone' is from the pen of a lady of Richmond, who has acquired a very&#xD;
gratifying reputation from other publications of less length. It is plainly&#xD;
discernible from the present volume, that the fair authoress is not a novice&#xD;
in the construction of dramatic narrative. 'Alone' is a book of great merit,&#xD;
and we recall portions which display a thorough knowledge of that art which&#xD;
enters so largely into the eharact~r of every tale-teller--~-we mean the art of&#xD;
the raconteur. We have seldom met with a work of this kind more gracefully&#xD;

do not entirely sympathize with the author's creed, see much that is good in&#xD;
the earnestness and force with which the necessity of serious religious prin-&#xD;
ciple at the bottom of action is dwelt upon. The scenery of this tale is laid&#xD;

are not treated in a way to give it at all the character of a partizan bc~ok."-&#xD;

"'ALoxE.' By MARION JIARLAND. Published by A. Morris, Richmond, Va.&#xD;
"We are indebted to the publisher for a copy of this late issue from his&#xD;
press. It is decidedly the best work of 'its kind that has been issued for a&#xD;
long time, and is one of the very few novels that should find admittance to&#xD;
the family circle. The booli is gotten up in a style that reflects great credit&#xD;
upon its publisher."- W~jtheville (Va.) TeJe~~p'ap1i.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Alone" is the unique title of a work from the pen of Marion Harland, a&#xD;
lady of Richmond, Va., and sent to us by the publisher, A. Morris. We com-&#xD;
mend it to our readers as a chastely and beautifully Written work, presenting&#xD;
many truthful pictures of the human heart. The character of Ida, as there&#xD;
portrayed, gentle and affectionate, forms a striking contrast to that of Jose.&#xD;
phine, malicious and revengeful. The pure and elevated tone which pervades&#xD;
the entire work is a sufficient recommendation."-Atilton (N. C.) Spectator.&#xD;
"'ALo~E.'-.We ask attention to the criticisms of this favorite novelette, as&#xD;
found in our advertising columns. We have not had an opportunity of read-&#xD;
ing it, but from the kind reception it has met at the haiids of the press, the&#xD;
uniform approbation it has secured, and the numerous editions it has already&#xD;
passed through, it is fair to infer that 'Alone' stands far above the light&#xD;
literature of tl~e day, in its style and general detail. A. Morris, Publisher,&#xD;
Richmond."-Frederickebur~~ (Pa.) Herald.&#xD;
"'ALONE.' By MARION IIARLAND. Richmond: Published by A. Morris.&#xD;
1854. The fair author of this tale is a resident of the city in which it is pub-&#xD;
lished. It has met with extraordinary success, considering the very short&#xD;
period which has elapsed since its appearance, and the unheralded, unobtru.~'&#xD;
sive character of the writer. It is thrown forth into the literary gulf to sink&#xD;
or survive by its own qualities. It airouches to be 'a simple tale of life; and&#xD;
of truthfulness to nature.' We take it to~ibe such, notwithstanding the well-&#xD;
known peccadilloes of this species of author-craft, and give it the merit of&#xD;
substantial reality, with the allowable substitution of fictitious for real names,&#xD;
and the less veracious introduction of fancy.coloring to embellish the picture.&#xD;
It is, in our judgment, far above the level of that class of books to which it&#xD;
categorically belongs. It displays decided genius, unusual fertility of inven-&#xD;
tion, a sparkling vivacity of expression, a natural aptness of interlocution, a&#xD;
ready delineation of character, and a picturesque descriptiveness of scenes.&#xD;
Many passages exhibit a masculine power of conception combined with femi-&#xD;
nine sentimentality. The morale'of the book, we regard, as good, and many&#xD;
of its religious sketches as extremely truthful and touching. At the, same&#xD;
thue, we are compelled to say, that some of its conversational sallies are too&#xD;
strongly marked by passion and hyperbole, and that the chapter on the Rocky&#xD;
Mount meeting, appears to contain a sarcastic fling ~it revivals of religion.&#xD;
As a specimen of native female talent, it is undoubtedly Qreditable, and will&#xD;
be read with a lively appreciation of the intellectual activity which pervades&#xD;
it, and the piety it inculcates, maugre the satire on the preachers and pro-&#xD;
ceedings at Rocky Mount. tt has reached its third edition."-Metkodi6e&#xD;

Us immediate neighborhood. The style is easy and graceful, the story is well&#xD;
planned, natural and life-like in its conception, and teeming with interest in&#xD;
its details; while a vein of rich and cheerful humor and an overflowing sym-&#xD;
pathy pervade the e~itire work and sparkle upon every page. As the story&#xD;
progresses, so in accordance with the transactions of every-day life are all its&#xD;
representations, thatits characters seem to rse into life and gather about us,&#xD;
winning otr love by their open frankness of disposition, or repelling us by&#xD;
their want of generous feeling and .their exhibition of narrow selfishness.&#xD;
"But the superior merit of this book does not consist merely in the interest&#xD;
of the story, with its glowing thoughts and exquisite fancies; not in the faith-&#xD;
ful portraiture of life and delineations of character; not in the voices of&#xD;
sympathy constantly falling like music upon the heart tp quicken its better&#xD;
feelings; nor yet in its unwavering adhesion to what is ~right and proper in&#xD;
Itself; but4bove all this, shining forth and giving new l~eauty to all that is&#xD;
attractive in human character, the purity and simplicity and ,loveliness of&#xD;
christian principles breathe their ennobling spirit in every line. For none of&#xD;
its characters, however much they may be possessed of amiability and native&#xD;
excellence and however sweetly there may well up from their true hearts a&#xD;
constant, full and generous sympathy-no character is perfect till the gentle&#xD;
influences of a true and loving faith come in to purify the affections, subdue&#xD;
the will, hold in check theicas worthy and quicken the better emotions and&#xD;
feelings, giving to each a sweetness that cannot fail and crowning all with a&#xD;
glory that never fades.&#xD;

"ALONE. By MARION HARLAND. Richmond: A. ~iorris. Third edition.&#xD;
."This is a Riobmond book. Written by a Richmond lady, published by a&#xD;
Richmond house, and the scene is in Richmond. For these reasons mainly&#xD;
we have read it. It is a work of the imagination, m9ral in its tone, and&#xD;
aiming to set forth the subduing, transforming, and elevating influences of&#xD;
religion in its teachings. We may mention these points without approving&#xD;
its sentiments, or the mode of inculcating them. It was for ~none of these&#xD;
things, however, that we looked into the volume. We were looking into its&#xD;
literary merit~, its style of composition, its indications of the poifers of the&#xD;
authoress, as' citizen of our goodly metropolis. The volume is well written,&#xD;
the style simile, graceful, natural; sometimes bold and striking, with fine&#xD;
powers of describing persons, scenes and scenery; and a beaming out of the&#xD;
higher ,aud nobler impulses of feeling and passion, promising a future of&#xD;
fame, if we conld only say usefulne8e, to the gifted authoress."-Rickmond,&#xD;

"ALONE. By MARION HARLAND,&#xD;
"Is the title of a novel from the pen o~' a Virginia lady, recently issued&#xD;
from the press of A. Morris, Richmond. We kn~w of no pu~lica~ion of&#xD;
recent date which has commanded such universal admiration. It has r~lready&#xD;
passed through three editions, and the fourth will no doubt soon be exh4usted.&#xD;
The fact that it is the emanation of southern mind should be enough ~o pre-&#xD;
possess the Virginia reader in its favor. Unlike the great mass of similar&#xD;
productions, it has not the slightest taint of immorality. Indeed, it~ high&#xD;
moral tone, no less than its stirring incidents, commends it to universal&#xD;
favor. We think that Mr. Morris deserves great credit for encouraging&#xD;
Virginia authors by the publication of their works. 'Alone' has been gotten&#xD;
up in handsome style. Mr. Morris is quite extensively engaged in the pub-&#xD;
lishing business, and southern publishers ought 'to be encouraged in prefer.&#xD;

~-one of the 'hot pressed darlings~ ~of the day, puj7'ed up 8ecundern artem, in&#xD;

appointed. It is anything ~else than a pretentious book. On the contrary,&#xD;
it abounds from the first to the last page in the genuine displays of genius.&#xD;
The story is well conceived and its incidents happily developed. Th~re is&#xD;
nothing strained or unna1~ural about it, but t~i e narrative flows on smoothly&#xD;
and harmoniously through all its winding f~om the point at which it 4om-,&#xD;
mences to the closing scene in which it is h~st. Miss Harland has woi~ for&#xD;
herself, by this novel, more than an ephemer~tl reputation. She has Coil tri-&#xD;
buted, through its thirty-three chapters, m~ich to the cause, not only of&#xD;
literature generally, and 8out kern literature i ri particular, but to the cause of&#xD;
virtue. The pages of 'Alone' are equally adorned by the intellectual and&#xD;
the moral graces, and it gives us great pleasure to testify, in these terms, to&#xD;
its merits. We gladly welcome its appearance, and hope that it is but the&#xD;
precursor of others, which will still further enhance her claims to public&#xD;

the purity of the principles of Christianity, as applicable to the everyday&#xD;
affairs of life, were as strongly set forth as i~i this. We have but little skill&#xD;
to discourse in the technicalities of criticism, but we have found in this&#xD;
book incident enough, and wrought together with sufficient skill to enlist&#xD;
our feelings and enchain our attention from beginning to end; andwe ven-&#xD;

the course of its perusal, that he was not only a Christian in the ordinary&#xD;
