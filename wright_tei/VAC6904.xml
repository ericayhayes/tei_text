CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
I have written these Sketches for the sake of the entertainmeft&#xD;
there was in thus employing some oftthe time iii which [ had noth-&#xD;
ing else to do. I am now going to publish them, because I trust&#xD;
they will impart to otliers, assuredly not the same amount, but&#xD;
enough to frave me excused, both for the writing and for the pub-&#xD;
lishin g. I am willing that this -be thought an apology instead of a&#xD;
preface ; and if it be not a sufficient one, it is as great, I insist, as a&#xD;
&#xD;
man at my time of life ought to be expected to make.&#xD;
&#xD;
P. P.&#xD;
&#xD;
P. S.   I trust that those who have pd either of the first two of&#xD;
these stories, (the former in Porter's Spirit of the Times, the latter in&#xD;
the ie 1dand fireside,) will not seriously object to see them again&#xD;
~ . andi in this present form.  .&#xD;

"You callthis education, do you not&#xD;
Why 'tis the forced march of a herd of bnloeks&#xD;
Before a shouting drover."&#xD;
Booxs !-There is nothing terrible in this simple word. -On the&#xD;
contrary, it is a most harmless word. It suggests quiet and contem-&#xD;
plation, and though it be true, that books do often produce agit a' .&#xD;
tions in the minds of men, and in the state of society itself-some,"&#xD;
times even effecting great revolutions-yet, the simple enunciation,&#xD;
of the word, it would seem, could never be adequate to the production&#xD;
of even the smallest amount of excitement. As little would it seem,&#xD;
mn looking upon it from any point of view into which one could get&#xD;
one's self, to be capable of allaying excitement and producing the&#xD;
most sudden and perfect stillness. I never could exactly tell why&#xD;
it is, that as often as I have read of the custom in England, of read-&#xD;
ing the Riot Act, during the progress of a riot, and begun to wonder&#xD;
how such an exercise was available in quelling it, my mind has&#xD;
recurred to the incidents aLout to be narrated, and been made at&#xD;
last, however reluctantly, o admit that the reading of the Act&#xD;
aforesaid, might be as proper a thing as could be done on such an&#xD;
oceasiou. For there was one point of view, or rather a point of&#xD;
hearing, from which one could observe the above last mentioned&#xD;
phenomenon produced by. the utterance of the word which begins&#xD;
this story, twice a day for five days in a week  It was the word of&#xD;
command with which Mr. Israel Meadows was wont to announced&#xD;
the pupils of the Gooepond school-house, the opening of the eehooI&#xD;
morning and afternoon.  o-                                           /&#xD;

HUMOROUS TALES.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Goosepond was situated in one of the counties of Middle&#xD;
Georgia,-on the edge of an old field, with original oak and hickory&#xD;
woods on three sides, and on the other a dense pine thicket.-&#xD;
Throgh this latter there lay a path which led to the school from a&#xD;
neighboring planter's house where Mr. Meadows boarded. The&#xD;
schol'hquse itself,, a rude hut built of logs, was about one hundred,&#xD;
and twenty yards from this thicket, at the point where the path&#xD;
emerged from it.&#xD;
Onecold, frosty morning, near the close of November, about twenty&#xD;
oys ul grls; 'were assembled as usual at the Goosepond, waiting&#xD;
tfor h. w;e '    Co both sexes were studying their lessons and&#xD;
some were playing--the boys at bull-pen, the girls at jumping the rope&#xD;
but all of them, with one exception-those studying and those&#xD;
playing, the former, though, the most eagerly---were watching the&#xD;
outh of the path at which the master was expected. Those&#xD;
yng were the most anxious :The players seemed to think the&#xD;
feworth the candle; though the rope jumpers jumped with their&#xD;
faces' toward the thicket ; the boys invariably ran to the corner&#xD;
nearest to it when they were about to throw the ball, and looking&#xD;
behind a moment, would instantly turn and throw it at his man in&#xD;
the opposite direction. The students, they walked to and fro before&#xD;
the door, allstudying aloud, and apparently exhibiting the greatest&#xD;
anxiety to transfer the secrets of knowledge which the books con-&#xD;
tained into their little heads. There was: one boy in particular whose&#xD;
eagerness for the acquisition of knowledge seemed to amount to a&#xD;
most violet passion. He was a raw-boned boy of fifteen years,&#xD;
with very light, coarse hair, and a freckled face. He wore a round-&#xD;
about and pants of worn walnut dyed homespun, an old sealskin&#xD;
cap and red brogans, without socks. He had come up after all the&#xD;
others had gotten there. He lived three miles and a half from the&#xD;
school-ho\1se, and walked the way forth and back every day. He&#xD;
came up shivering acid studying, performing'both of these apparently&#xD;
inconsistent operations with 'great violence.&#xD;
'lallo, Erinckly t' shouted half a. dozen boys. "Got in in time&#xD;
this morning, eh ? ha I ha I Why you aretoo' soon, my'boy. le&#xD;

won't be here for a carter of an hour yet. Come and help us out&#xD;
with the bill-pen. Now, look at him, got that eternal jography, and&#xD;
actily a studyin it, an he nigh an in about friz. Put the book down an&#xD;
go an warm yourself a bit, and come an take Bill Jones' place.--&#xD;
Its his day to make fires. Come, we've got the inses.'&#xD;
This last was addressed by the 'one exception' above mentioned&#xD;
a large, well-growh, square-shouldered boy, eighteen years old,&#xD;
named Allen Thigpen. Brinckly Glisson paid no attention to the&#xD;
invitation; but came on up shivering and studying, and studymg&#xD;
and shivering: and just as he passed Allen he announced the i:w-&#xD;
ing proposition.&#xD;
'A-an emp-pi-re is a e-c-ountry ge-ge-overned by an' e-emperor'.&#xD;
Now ordinarily, the announcement of this proposition, one wyivld&#xD;
think would be entirely incapable to excite any uncommon amount&#xD;
of risibility. It contains a simple truth and expresses it in simple&#xD;
. terms. And yet, so it was, that Mr. Allen Thigpen burst into a roar&#xD;
of laughter; and as if she understood that the proposition had been&#xD;
submitted to him for ratification or denial answered&#xD;
'Well, Brinckly, spozen it is. Who in the dickens said it were'nt "?&#xD;
I didn't; did you, Sam Pate?'&#xD;
'Do what'?' asked Sam, pausing in the act of throwing the ball.&#xD;
'Did you say that a empire want a-what Brinc kly said it was?'&#xD;
'I did'nt hear what Brinckly said it was,'&#xD;
Allen strode up behind Brinckly and looking over his shoulder&#xD;
said slowly, 'A country governed by an emperor.'&#xD;
:&amp;amp;No, I never said nothin about it; and I don't know nothing about&#xD;
it; nur I don't keer nothin about it neither.' And away Went the&#xD;
ball, but Sam had thrown it too suddenly, after looking towards the&#xD;
mouth of the path, and he missed his man,&#xD;
Allen laughed exceedingly at this efort at humor. But Brinkly&#xD;
did not even notice the. interruption. H walkedto nd  r  and&#xD;
shivered and studied. He bowed to the book;- he dug into it;- he&#xD;
grated his teeth, not*e anger, but in his eagerness to get what was&#xD;
in it; he tried to fasten it in his head, whether or not, by alghtl&#xD;

hanging the words, and making them, as it were, his own to cm&#xD;
sid.&#xD;
'An'yempire,' said he fiercely, but not over loudly, 'is a ke-uney&#xD;
geuverned by an ye-emperor.'&#xD;
'And what is a ye-emperor, Brinekly ?' asked Allen, and he&#xD;
{anghed again.&#xD;
'Oh Allen, pleasago awayband let me alone. I almost had it.&#xD;
You know Mr. Meadows will beat me if I don't get it ; you know h&#xD;
loves to beat me any how. Do let me alone ; it sorter begins to&#xD;
come to me now.' And he went on shivering and studying, and&#xD;
shiveringly announcing, among other things, that, .an y-empire was&#xD;
a ke-untry ge-uverned by -an ye-emperor,' emphasising each one of&#xD;
the polysyilables in its turn ; sometimes stating the proposition&#xD;
slowlyand cautiously, and rather interrogatively, as if half inclined&#xD;
to doubt it; at others asserting it with alvehemence which showed&#xD;
it to be his settled conviction that it was true, and that whoever&#xD;
deuUed it, knew nothing about the subject.&#xD;
Allen Thigpen turned from him' and walked to where a rosy..&#xD;
peeked little fellow, of eight years, was sitting on a stump with a&#xD;
spelling book in his lap, and a pin in his right hand with which lh&#xD;
dotted every fourth word, after reciting the following :&#xD;
'Betsy Wiggins.' '&#xD;
'ieneritter Bangs.&#xD;
'Mandy Grizzle.&#xD;
'Mie! (dot) a-ig-htlight-alight'&#xD;
Betsy Wiggins-&#xD;
'ieneritter Bangs.&#xD;
Mandy Grizzle.&#xD;
'Mine't do de l-i-g-h-t light-delight ;' and so on.&#xD;
'I yi, my little Mr. Asa,' said Allen, 'and spozin Betsy Wiggins&#xD;
misses her word, or Heneritter Bangs hern, er Mandy Grizzle Bern,&#xD;
then who's goin to spell em, I want to know? And what'll you give&#xD;
me,' continued Allen, placing his rough hand witiMionical fondness&#xD;
+m the child's bead, 'what'll you give me not tartell Mr. Meadows&#xD;

'Whatl1 you give me ?&#xD;

p, counting out twenty, handed them to Allen.&#xD;
'Got any more?' asked Mr. Thigpen, cracking one with his teeth.&#xD;
'Oh, Alien, please don't take em all,&#xD;
Out with em, you little word gitter. A boy that picks out words&#xD;
ai-. liable to eat che nuts.'&#xD;
Asa disgorged to the last one. Allen ate one or two, lookig&#xD;
queically into the child's face, and then handed the rest back to&#xD;
ak.&#xD;
'Thke your chetnuto, Asa Boatright, and eat em. If ever I git to&#xD;
be as feared of a human as you and Brinkly Glisson is of Isrel&#xD;
Meadows, drot my hide if I don't believe I will commit sovicide on&#xD;
ysel    ysm onmyse by cutting my own throat.'&#xD;
'Yes,' answered Asa, 'you can talk so because you arq a big boy,&#xD;
and you know he's afraid of you. If you was as little as me, you&#xD;
would be as afraid of him as me. If I never git a man'-the little&#xD;
fellow was about to continue whimpering, but suddenly chec king&#xD;
bimseli lhe took his pin and mumbled :&#xD;
'Betsy Wigg ins.&#xD;
'Heneritter Bangs.&#xD;
Mandy Grizzle.&#xD;
'Mine'! he resumed his interestIng and ingenious occupation of&#xD;
dotting every fourth word. Brinckly had overheard Allen's taunt&#xD;
and closing his book, after a pause of a few seconds, he walked&#xD;
straight up to him and said :&#xD;
'Allen Thigpcn, I am no more afraid of hih than you are; 4or&#xD;
than I am of you. I aint waiting to git to be a man to pay him&#xD;
back for the beating he has given me. Do you think that's what&#xD;
aakes me stand what I do? If you do, you are much nistaken.&#xD;
Allen, I'm try ing all the time hard to keep down on mother's&#xD;
account. I've told her of some of his treatment to me, and that I&#xD;
woid'nt staid it;. and she's always crying and teling me she is to&#xD;

1ose it, that I have been trying all I could to git the lessons, and to&#xD;
keep from fighting hirn when he beats me ; and I could git em if I&#xD;
had a chance. But the fact. is, I aint got on far enough in reading&#xD;
to have been put in this jography ; and he's just put me in it before&#xD;
I learnt to read right, just to git out of mother th e extra pay for&#xD;
jography; and I can't git it. and I have'nt learnt anything since I&#xD;
have been put into it; and, Allen Thigpen, I am not going to stand&#xD;
it much longer, nor I aint going to pay you ,chestnuts not to tell&#xD;
him 'I said so neither.'&#xD;
'Hooraw!' shouted Allen, 'give me your hand, Brinkly.' In a&#xD;
lower tone he continued, 'By jiugo, I thought it was in you. I seen&#xD;
you many a time when, thinks I to myself, it would'nt take much to&#xD;
make Brinkly Glisson fight you old fellow.' Then taking him a little&#xD;
way off, he whispered, 'you've stood enough already,,and too much,&#xD;
too. My blood has biled many a time when he's been a beating&#xD;
you. Don't you stand it no longer. Ef he beats you again, pitch&#xD;
into him. Try to 'ride him from the ingoin. He can maul you I&#xD;
expect, but look at this,' and Allen raised his fist, about the size of a&#xD;
mallet.'&#xD;
Brinkly looked at the big fist and brawny arm, and smiled dis-&#xD;
mally.&#xD;
'BooKs!' shouted a voice, and Mr. Israel Meadows emerged, from&#xD;
the'thicket with a handfull of hickory switches.&#xD;
In an instant there was a rushing of boys and girls into the&#xD;
house-all except Allen, who took his time. .Asa Boatright was the&#xD;
last of the others to get in. He had changed his position from the&#xD;
stump, and was walking, book in hanti, apparently all-absorbed in&#xD;
its contents, though his eye was on the schoolmaster, whose notice&#xD;
he was endeavoring to attract. Book"in hand, he bowed and digged&#xD;
and dived, until, as the master drew near, he weariedly looked up,&#xD;
and seeing him quite unexpectedly,..gave one more profound dive into&#xD;
his book and darted intothe house.r&#xD;
It was a iule at the xoosepond, that the scholars should all be in&#xD;
anfd aheir... seats when Mr  eadows arrived. His wont was to&#xD;
shout 'Books fiomthe-mouth of the path,then to walk with great&#xD;

rapidity to the house, Woe to the boy or girl who was ever too late,&#xD;
unless it happened to be Allen Thigpen. He had, some months&#xD;
before been heard to say that ding any sich rule, and he was'nt&#xD;
going to break his, neck for Israel Meadows nor nobody else; and&#xD;
so he was wont to take his time. If he got in behind the master,&#xD;
which frequently happened, that gentleman was kind enough not&#xD;
to notice it--an illustration of an exception ta the goo d discipline of&#xD;
country school-masters, which was quite common in the times " in&#xD;
which Mr. Meadows lived and flourished.&#xD;
On this occasion, when Mr. Meadows saw Allen, knowing that&#xD;
the gait at which himself was walking would take him into the house&#xD;
before Allen would get in, he halted a little, and taking a step or&#xD;
two, stooped, and, having untied one of his shoestrings, tied it again&#xD;
While this operation       Q was going on, Allen went in. Mr. Meadows&#xD;
rising immediately, struck fnto a brisk walk eas if to a Mefos&#xD;
his delay, and then entered into the scene of his daily triumphs.&#xD;
But before we begin the day's work, let us inquire who this Mr.&#xD;
Meadows was and whence he came.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.                 .&#xD;
Mr. Israel Meadows was a man thirty-five or forty years of age,&#xD;
five feet ten inches in height, with a lean figure, dark complexion,&#xD;
very black and shaggy hair and eyebrows, 8:nd a grim and forbidding&#xD;
expression of countenance. Tu      t   of training the youthful&#xD;
mind 'and leading it to the mountains of wisdom, as delightful and&#xD;
interesting as it is, was not in fact Mr. Meadows' choice, when, on&#xD;
arriving at manhood's estate, he looked around him for a career in&#xD;
which he might the most surely develop and advance his being in&#xD;
this life. Indeed, those who had been the witnesses of his youth and&#xD;
young manhood, and of the opportunities which he had been favored&#xD;
withal for getting instruction for himself, were no little surprised&#xD;
when they heard that in the county of   , their old acquaintence&#xD;
had undertaken, and was in the actual'prosecution of the profession&#xD;
of a schoolmaster. About one hundred miles from the Goosepond,&#xD;
was the spot which had the honor of giving him  lrth. In a cot-&#xD;
tage on one of the roads leading to the city of. Augusta, there' had&#xD;

lived a coupe who cultivated a farm, end traded 'with the wagoners&#xD;
of those days by bartering, for money and groceries, corn, fodder,&#xD;
potatoes, and such like commodities. It wae a matter never fully&#xD;
accountabl how it Was, that Mr. Timothy Meadows, during al1&#xD;
seasons, had corn to sell. Drought or drench affected his crib alike&#xD;
That is, they did not affect it at all. When a wagoner wished to&#xD;
buy eorn, Timothy Meadows generally, if not always, bad a little to&#xD;
spare. People used to intimate sometimes that it was mighty cuious&#xD;
that some folks could always have corn to sell, while other olks&#xD;
could'nt. Such observations were ipade in reference to no individual&#xD;
in particular, but were generally made by one farmer to another,&#xD;
when, perchance, they'had just ridden by Mr. Meadows' house while&#xD;
a wagoner's team was feeding at his camp. To this respectable couple&#xD;
there had been born only one offspring, a daughter. Miss Clary&#xD;
Meadows had lived to the age of twenty-four, and had never, within&#xD;
the knowledge of any of the neighbors, had the first beau. if to the&#xD;
fact that her father's always having corn to sell, without his neighbors&#xD;
knowing exactly how he came by it, had to a considerable extent&#xD;
discouraged visiting between their families and his (though it must&#xD;
be owned that this was not the fault of the Meadowses, who had re-&#xD;
peatedly, in spite of their superior fortune, shown dispositions to&#xD;
cultivate good' neighborhood with all the families around) if to this&#xD;
fact be added the further one, that Miss Clary was bony, and, in no&#xD;
respect, possessed of charms likely to captivate a young gentleman&#xD;
who had thoughts upon marriage, it ought not to be very surprising&#xD;
that she had, thus far, failed to secure a husband. Nevertheless'&#xD;
Miss Meadows was eminently affable when in the society of such&#xD;
gentlemen of the wagoners who paid her the compliment to cal&#xD;
upon her in the house. So that no person, however suspicious'&#xD;
would have concluded from her manner on such occasions, that her&#xD;
prolonged state of single blessedness was owing to any prejudice to,&#xD;
'he opposite *.&#xD;
It is a remarkable thing-.whether in physiology or psychology,&#xD;

their very habits and ways, and even the good luck and bad huck of their&#xD;
#ves. We have seen how that Mr. Meadows was wont to have corn to&#xD;
sell at all seasons, while nobody ever knew how he got it. Strange and&#xD;
unaccountable as this wa's, it was not more strange and unaccountable&#xD;
than a fact which, about this period of Miss Olary's life, transpired&#xD;
in her fortunes. To make short a long matter, Miss Clary had a&#xD;
baby ; and in reference to this same baby, as to how he came there,&#xD;
there has been no more definite information-yea, even to this day-&#xD;
than as to how three-fourths of the corn which Timothy Meadows sold,&#xD;
found its way into his crib.&#xD;
Israel, the baby---another thing uncommon with children--took the&#xD;
name of his mother. The class of children of which he was an in-&#xD;
dividual, are wont to have no names except such as they can acquire&#xD;
by reputation. Generally, we know, society gives to the young the&#xD;
names of their fathers; and by good rights, Israel ought to have borne&#xD;
another name than Meadows. Yea, doubtless, he would have done s'&#xD;
if it had ever been possible for him to have found his father.&#xD;
But if he ever went out upon that laudable and pious pursuit, it is&#xD;
certain that he failed in the prosecution of it. And so society, being&#xD;
no more successful than himself, pronounood him in legal terms nul2iue&#xD;
jiJus, which was asserting in so'many words, that he never had a&#xD;
father, and considering Miss Clary as solely responsible for his coming&#xD;
ito the world, it gave him her name after he got here.&#xD;
There were many interesting occurrences in the early life of Israel&#xD;
which, it would be foreign to the purpose of this history to relate. It is&#xD;
tough to say, that he grew up under the eye and training of his grand-&#xD;
father, and soon showed that some of the traits of that gentleman's charao.&#xD;
ter were in no danger of being lost to society by atfhiluro of reproduction,&#xD;
In process of time. Mr. and-Mrs. Meadows were gathered to their&#xD;
fathers, and Miss Clary, yet unmarried, had become the proprietress&#xD;
af the cottage and the farm. Israel had the luck of the Meadowses to&#xD;
be always able to sell corn to the wagoners. But unluckily the secret&#xD;
which lay hidden in euch profundity during the lifetime of his grand-&#xD;
father, of how this wonderful faculty existed, did about six months&#xD;

spire--a circumstance which would induce one to suspect, in spite of&#xD;
the declaration of the law in such case made and provided, that there&#xD;
was something in the blood of Israel which was not all Meadows.-&#xD;
One Saturday night, a company of the neighbors on patrol, found a&#xD;
negro man issuing from the gate of Miss Meadows' yard with an&#xD;
empty meal bag. Having apprehended him, they had given him not&#xD;
more than a dozen stripes with a cowhide, before he confessed that he&#xD;
just carried the bag full of corn to Israel from his master's corn crib.&#xD;
The company immediately aroused him, informed him what the slave&#xD;
had confessed, and although he did most stoutly deny any and all&#xD;
manner of connection With the matter, they informed him that they&#xD;
should not leave the premises until they could go and get a search&#xD;
wgrent from a neighboring magistrate, by which, as their spokes-&#xD;
man, a shrewd man said; they could identify the corn. This was a&#xD;
ruse to bring him to terms. -Seeing his uneasiness, they pushed on,&#xD;
and in a careless manner proposed, that if he would leave the neigh-&#xD;
borhood by the next Monday morning, they would forbear to prose.&#xD;
cute him for this as well as many similar offences, his guilt of which&#xD;
they intimated they had abundant proof to establis h. Israel was&#xD;
caught ; he =reflected for a few moments, and then, still however,&#xD;
asserting his innocence, but declaring that he did'not wish to reside&#xD;
iii a community where he was suspected of crime, he expressed his&#xD;
resolution to comply with their demand. He left the next day.&#xD;
Leaving his mother, he set out to try his fortune elsewhere, intend-&#xD;
ing by the time that the homestead could be disposed of, he would&#xD;
remove with her to the west. But determining not to be idle in the&#xD;
meantime, after wandering abut for several days in search of em&#xD;
ployment, it suddenly occurred to him one night, -fter a day's travel&#xD;
that would endeavor to get a school for the remainder of the&#xD;
year.                                   .     . ~&#xD;
Now, Israel's education had been somewhat neglected. Indeed,&#xD;
he had never been to school a day in his whole life. But he had at&#xD;
1ome, under the'-tuition of his mother, been taught reading and&#xD;
writing, and his grandfather had imparted to him som*  wleage r e&#xD;
of arithmetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
But Mr. Israel Meadows, although not a man of great learning, was&#xD;
a great way removed from being a fool. He had a considerable&#xD;
amount of the wisdom of this world, which comes to a man from&#xD;
other sources besides books. He was like many other men in one&#xD;
t respect. He was not to be restrained from taking office by the&#xD;
pF      consciousness of parts inadequate to the discharge of its duties.&#xD;
This is a species of delicacy which, of all others, is attended by&#xD;
fewer practical results. Generally the most it does, is to make its&#xD;
owner confess with modesty, his unfitness for the office, with a he&#xD;
''had hoped some. worthier and better man had been chosen,' and'&#xD;
then take it. Israel wisely reflected, that with a majority of man-&#xD;
kind, the only thing necessary to establish for oneself a reputation of a&#xD;
fitness for office, is to run for it and to get into it. A wise reflection&#xD;
indeed ; acting on which, many men have become great in Georgia,&#xD;
and, I doubt not, elsewhere, with nopother capital than the adroit-&#xD;
ness or the accident which placed them  in office. He reflected&#xD;
further, and as wisely as before, that the office of a schoolmaster in&#xD;
a country school was as little likely as any he could think of, to&#xD;
furnish an exception to the general rule. Thus, in less than six&#xD;
-    weeks from the eventful Saturday night, with a list of school articles,&#xD;
which he had picked up in his travels, he had applied for and had&#xD;
obtained, and had opened the Goosepond school, and was professing&#xD;
to teach the children spelling, reading and writing at the rate of a&#xD;
dollar a nionth ; and arithmetic and geography, at the advanced rate&#xD;
of a dollar and a half.&#xD;
Such. were some of Mr. Meadows' antecedents.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
It was the custom of the, pupils in the Goosepond, as in most of&#xD;
the other country schools of those times, to study aloud. Whether&#xD;
the teachers thought that the mind could not act unless the tongue&#xD;
was agoing, or that the tongue agoing was the only evidence that&#xD;
the mind was acting, it never did appear. Such had been the cus-&#xD;
tom, and Mr. Meadows.did not aspire to be an innovator., It was&#xD;
his rule, however, that there should be perfect silence on his arrival,&#xD;
o give him an opportunity of saying or doing anything he might&#xD;

wish. This morning there did not seem to be anything on his mini&#xD;
whieh required to be lifted off. HEo, however, looked at Brinckly&#xD;
Glisson with some disappointment of expression. He had beaten&#xD;
him unmercifully the morning before, for not having gotten there ino&#xD;
time, though the boy's excuse was that he had gone a mile- out of hihs&#xD;
way on an errand for his mother. lie looked at the boy as if he had&#xD;
expected to have had some business, with him. which now unexpet-&#xD;
edly had to be postponed. He then looked around over the school&#xD;
and said :&#xD;
.Go to studying '&#xD;
It was plain, that in that house, Mr. Meadows had been in the habit&#xD;
of speaking but to command, and of commanding but to be obeyed. fn-&#xD;
stantaneously was heard then and thero, that unintelligible tumult, the&#xD;
most invariable incident of the country schools of that generation.&#xD;
There were spellers and readers ; geographers and aritlimeticians, all&#xD;
engaged in their several pursuits, in the most inexplicable confusion.&#xD;
Sometirhes the spellers would have the heels of the others, and&#xD;
sometimes the readers. The geographers were always third d,, and&#xD;
the aritmeticians always behind. It was very plain to be seen that&#xD;
these last never would catch the others. The faster they added or&#xD;
subtracted, the oftener they had to rub out and commence anew. It&#xD;
was always but a short time before they found this to be the case,&#xD;
and so they generally concluded to adopt the maxim of the philos&#xD;
opher, of being slow in making haste. The geographers were a&#xD;
little faster, and a little louder. But the spellers and' readers had it,&#xD;
I tell you. Each speller, and each reader went through the whole&#xD;
gamut of sounds, from low up to high, and from high down to low&#xD;
again ; sometimes by regular ascension and descension one note at&#xD;
a me, sounding what musiciains call the chromatic intervals ; at&#xD;
other tiuies, goin' up and coniing down upon the perfect fifths.&#xD;
only. Oh.! it was so refreshing to see the passionate eagerness&#xD;
which these urchins manifested for the acquisition of knowledge.&#xD;
To have sliced out about five seconds of that studying and pub the&#xD;
words together, would have made a sentence somewhat like the&#xD;
following :&#xD;

To have heard them for the first time, one would have been re-&#xD;
inded of the Apostles' preaching at Pentecost, and it might not&#xD;
have been difficult to have persuaded a; stranger unused, to such&#xD;
things that there were then and there spoken the languages of the&#xD;
Parthians and Medes, Elamites and the dwellers h- Mesopotamia,&#xD;
and in Judea and Cappadoei ;- in Pontus and Asia; Phrygia and&#xD;
Parophylia ; in Egypt and in the parts of Syria about Cyrene ; and&#xD;
strangers of Rome, Jews and Prossylites, Cretes and Arabians.&#xD;
Sometimes these cloven tongues would subside a little, when it&#xD;
might be half a dozen would stop to blow; but in a moment more,&#xD;
the chorus would swell again in a new and livler ac crescendo.--&#xD;
'When this process had gone on for half an ho;r, Mr. Malows lifted&#xD;
tm his voice and shouted 'SILENcE,' and all was still.&#xD;
Now were to commence the recitations, during which, perfect&#xD;
u'euce was required. For as great a help to study as this jargon&#xD;
was, Mr. Meadows found that it did not contribute any aid to the&#xD;
doing of his work.&#xD;
He now,performed a feat which he had never performed before in&#xD;
exactly that manner. He put his hand behind the lappel of his&#xD;
o at-collar for a moment, and thqjn, after withdrawing it and holding&#xD;
Q. it up, his thumb and forefinger joined together, he said :&#xD;
'There is too much fuss here. I'm going tQ drop this pin, and I&#xD;
shall whip every single one of you little boys that don't hear it when&#xD;
it falls. Thar '&#xD;
'I heered it Mr. Meadows. I heerod it, Mr. Meadows,' exclaimed&#xD;
simultaneously, five or six little fellows.&#xD;
'Come up here you little raseals ; you are a liar1' Etaid he to each&#xD;
'se. 'I never drapped it; I never had nary one to, drap. It just&#xD;

HUMOROUS TALES.&#xD;
&#xD;
The little liars slunk to their seats. and the recitations comn-&#xD;
menced. -Memory was the only faculty of mind that underwent the&#xD;
smallest development at this school. Whoever could say exactly&#xD;
what the book said was adjudged to know his lesson. 'About half&#xD;
of the pupils on this inorning were successful. The other half were&#xD;
found to be delinquent: Among these was Asa Boatright's class.&#xD;
That calealatirg young gentleman ;knew his words and. fet safe.&#xD;
The class had spelled around three or foui' times, when, lo ! the&#xD;
contingency which Allen Thigpen had suggested, did come to pass,&#xD;
Betsy Wiggins missed her word ; Heneritter Bangs, (in the lan-&#xD;
guage of Alln,) hern, and Mandy Grizzle hernm; and thus responsi-&#xD;
bilities were suddenly cast upon Asa, ivhibh he was wholly unpre.&#xD;
pared to meet, and which, from the look of mighty reproach which&#xD;
hegave each of these young ladies, as she handed over to him her&#xD;
word, he evidently thought it the height of injustice, that he should&#xD;
have been called upon to meet. Mr. Meadows, closing the beok,&#xD;
tossed it to Asa, who, catching it as it was falling at his feet,&#xD;
turned, and, his eyes swiming with tears, went back to his seat.&#xD;
As he passed Allen Thigpen, the latter whispered :&#xD;
'What ditl I tell you? You cheered the pin drap too.'&#xD;
Now, Allen was in no plight to have given this taunt to Asa. He&#xD;
had not given five minutes study to 'his arithmetic during the&#xD;
whole morning, But Mr. Meadows made'a rule, (this one with him-&#xD;
self, though all the pupils knew it better than any rule he had, never&#xD;
to allow Allen to miss a lesson ; and as he had kindly taken this&#xD;
responsibility upon himself, Allen was wont to give himself no trou-&#xD;
ble about the matter.&#xD;
Brinkly Glisson was the last to recite. Brinkly was no great&#xD;
hand at pronunciation. He had been reading but a short. time&#xD;
when Mr. Meadows advanced him into geography, with the pur-&#xD;
pose, as Brinkly afterwards came to believe, of getting the half&#xD;
-        ,dollar extra tuition. This morning he thought he knew his lesson.;&#xD;
and he did, as he understood it. When called to recite, he went up&#xD;
with a countenance expressive of wild happiness, handed the book&#xD;
to Ir. Meadows, 'and putting his hands in his pockets, awaited the&#xD;
questions. And now it was an interesting sight to see Mr. Meadows.&#xD;

smile as Brinkly talked of is-lands, and prhmonitaries, thismuses&#xD;
and hemispheries. The lad misunderstood that smile, and his heart&#xD;
was glad for the unexpected reception of a little 'coinplacency from&#xD;
the master. But he was not long in error.&#xD;
'Is-lands, eh ?. Thismuises, eh? Take this book and see if you&#xD;
can find any is-lands, and promoniteries ; and then bring them&#xD;
to me; I want to see them things, I do. Find 'em if you please.'&#xD;
3rinkly took the book, and it would have melted the heart of any&#xD;
other man than Israel Meadows to have seen the deep despair of&#xD;
his heart as he looked on it and Was spelling ovei- to himself th&#xD;
words as he came to them.&#xD;
'Mr. Meadows,' he said, in pleading tones, 'I 'thought it was&#xD;
is-land. Here it is, Il-a-n-d-land : island;' and he looked into his&#xD;
face beseechingly.&#xD;
'Is-land, eh? Is-land ! Now, thismuses, ,and promonitaries and&#xD;
hemispheries -&#xD;
'Mr, Meadows I did not know how to pronounce them w ords. I&#xD;
asked you how to pronounce 'em, and you would'nt tell me; and I&#xD;
asked Allen, and he told me the way I said them.'&#xD;
'I believe that to be a lie.'&#xD;
Brinkly's face reddened, and his breathing was fast and hard. He&#xD;
looked at the master; as but once or twice before during the time he&#xD;
had looked at him, but made no answer. At that moment Allen&#xD;
leaned carelessly on his desk, his elbows resting on it, and his chii&#xD;
on his hands, and said, dryly :&#xD;
'Yes E did tell him so.'&#xD;
Mr. Meadows now reddened a little. After a moment's pause,&#xD;
however, he said&#xD;
'How often have I got to tell you not to ask any body but me how&#xD;
to pronounce words? That'll do sir ; set down sir.'&#xD;
Brinkly went to his seat, and looking gloomily towards the door&#xD;
a minute or two, he opened his book, but studied it no more.&#xD;

CUAPTIR IV.&#xD;
Mr. MeadoWes now set about,, what was the aly really pleas ant&#xD;
portion of his duties, te punishment of offenders. The lawyers tee&#xD;
as that of the several portions of the law, the ,ivdicatory is the most&#xD;
inperanti. Thiselement of the Goosepond had been-cultivated so&#xD;
much,, that it badgrow f t'beoore almost the only ene which was&#xD;
eonsulted &amp;amp;t all. A for thy  dedla-ratory, and the directory, they were&#xD;
considered, when clearly understood, as impediments to a iair'show-&#xD;
ing and proper development of the vindicatory, in so much that&#xD;
the latter was often, by their means, disappointed of a victim for its&#xD;
daily food. 'Mr. Meadows used, somtimes when his 4rchins would&#xD;
not 'miss' or violate any law, to put the vindicatory first, punish an&#xD;
offender, and declare what he had. done to be an offense, and then&#xD;
direct him that he had better not do so any more. He seemed to&#xD;
owe a grudge to society. Whether for its not having give a him a&#xD;
father, as it had done to every body else, or because it had inter&#xD;
fered in the peacefulocupation which he had inherited froin his&#xD;
grandfather, as if to avenge itself on . him for violating one of it&#xD;
express commands, that he, and such as he, should inherit nothing&#xD;
from anbody, it did appear. But he owed it, and he delighted in&#xD;
paying it off by beating those children, each of whom did have, or&#xD;
had had a father: So, on this morning, by'way of taking up another&#xD;
instalment on this immense debt, which, like most other debts,&#xD;
seemed as if it never would get fully paid, he took down his bundle&#xD;
of hickories from two pegs in one of the logs in the side of the house,&#xD;
on which he had placed them on his coming in, selected one five or&#xD;
six feet long, and walking to the middle of the vacant place between&#xD;
the fire-place and the rows of desks, he 'sat down in his chair and&#xD;
'Them spelling classes and"reading classes, and them others that's&#xD;
got to be whipped, all but Sam Pate and Asa Boatright, come to the&#xD;
circus.'&#xD;
Five or six boys, and as many girls, from eight to thirteen years&#xD;
old came up, and sitting down on the front bench, which extended&#xD;

their shoes and stockings, the boys rolling up their pants, and the&#xD;
girls lifting their skirts up to their knees, 'they made a ring around&#xD;
Mr. Meadows as lie sat in his chair, -and commenced a brisk trot.&#xD;
They had described two or three revolutions, and Mr. Meadows was&#xD;
straightening his hickory, when Asa Roatright ran up, and crying&#xD;
piteously, said .&#xD;
'Please sir, Mr. Meadows ; please sir, Mr. Meadows, let me go io&#xD;
the circus !'&#xD;
Mr. Mea lows rose up, and raised his hickory to strike ; but he&#xD;
looked at him  a moment amusedly, and pointed to his seat.&#xD;
went back to it, looking most forlorn. Mr. Meadows, resuming h%&#xD;
seat, went at once into the exciting part of the exhibition, by to y-&#xD;
ping the legs as they trotted around him. This was done nat first&#xD;
very gently, and almost lovingly.- But gradually as the sport&#xD;
warmed in interest, the rapidity and violence of the blows increased.&#xD;
The children began to cry out, and then Mr. Meadows struck the&#xD;
harder, for it was a rule-oh, he was a mighty man for rules, this&#xD;
Mr. Meadows-that whoever cried the loudest should be hit the&#xD;
hardest. ie kept up this interesting and exciting amusement, un-&#xD;
til he had given them about twenty five lashes apiece, ihe most of&#xD;
themr being easily counted by the stripes. Ie then ceased. They&#xD;
stopped instantly, walked around him once, then seating themselves&#xD;
again on the bench, and resuming their shoes aid stockings, they&#xD;
went to their seats. One girl, thirteen years old, had begged him&#xD;
to let her keep on her stockings ; but Mr. Meadows was too f1rm a&#xD;
disciplinarian to allow it. When she returned to the front bench,&#xD;
she put on her shoes, and taking her stockings up, and putting them&#xD;
under her apron, she went to her seat and sobbed as if her heart was&#xD;
broken.&#xD;
Allen Thigpen looked at her a moment, and then he turned his&#xD;
eye slowly around and looked at Brinkly Glisson, The latter did&#xD;
K ~  not notice him. He sat with his hands in his pockets, [and his lips&#xD;
compressed. Allen knew the struggle that was going on, and he&#xD;
longed to see how it would end. Mr. Meadows rested three&#xD;
minutes.&#xD;

It. has no doubt occurred to those who may have been reading&#xD;
this true story, that it was ,a strange thing in Asa Boatright, who so&#xD;
well'inew Mr. Meadows' ways, that 'he should have expressed so'&#xD;
decisive a wish to take part in this last described exhibition, an&#xD;
exhibition which, however entertaining to Mr. Meadows, as it.doubt&#xD;
less was, and might 'be to many other persons, placing them in the&#xD;
attitudes of spectators purely, was not, t te highest degree, agree-&#xD;
able to one in the attitudewhich Master Asa must have known he&#xD;
would have been ade to assume, had Mr. Meadows vouchsafed to&#xD;
have vilded to his request. But Aa awas not   Lby byho was&#xD;
aeihe  bo U not oue 'who ha1 no care forhis, p' al eieing.&#xD;
ie hew what e was about.&#xD;
'8a3n Pate and A a Boatiight,' said .Mr. Meadow , after his ren1&#xD;
come out here and go to horsin--&#xD;
Tb'two lads came out. Master Pate gently inclined himself for-&#xD;
ward, and Master Boatright got upon his back, and locked his arms&#xD;
around his neck. The former gathering' the latter's legs in his arms,&#xD;
and drawing as tightly as possible his pants across his middle,&#xD;
commenced galloping as fast as he could around the area before the&#xD;
fire-place. Mr. Meadows having taken a fresh hickory; commenced&#xD;
appplying it with great force and precision to that part of Master'&#xD;
Boatright's little body, which, in his present attitude, was the&#xD;
most exposed. Every application of this kind cpused that young&#xD;
gentleman to scream to the utmost of the strength of his voice, and&#xD;
even to kickwhich, Master Pate being for the occasion a horse, was-&#xD;
to understand as the expression of a wish on the part of his rider, that&#xD;
he should get on faster, and to frisk apd-toprance, and otherwise to&#xD;
imitate a horse as far as he could in the circumstances. Now, these&#xD;
circumstances being, that as soon as Mester Boatright should have&#xD;
ridden him abo t long 'enough, to have become incapacitated from&#xD;
riding a real horse with even the smallest degree of comfort, they&#xD;
were to reverse positions, Master Beatright becoming horse and uhiu-&#xD;
self $,dr, they were hardly sufficient to make him entirely forget&#xD;
his identity in the personation of that quadruped. He did his best&#xD;
though in the circumstances, such as they were, and not only&#xD;

UUMOROUs TALCs.                     21&#xD;
pranced, but even neighed several times. When Asa was put into&#xD;
the condition hinted at above, he was allowed to dismounts Sam&#xD;
having mounted on his back, it was truly stirring to the feeltgto&#xD;
see the latter kick and the former prance. This was always the&#xD;
best part of the show. A rule of this exercise was, that when the -&#xD;
rider should dismount and become the horse, he was to act well his&#xD;
part, or be made to resume the part of rider, a prospect not at all&#xD;
agreeable, each one decidedly preferring the part of the horse. Sam&#xD;
w    boÂ°t three yenr' oledr  t A' f  r , -   rfmm. heQ ' vht"&#xD;
.'t&#xD;
about furiously, but fell several times. Finding that he~ eiikM&#xD;
no grea things at prancing, he attempted to make up ir 'l -&#xD;
n ciency by neighing. When Sam cried out and kicked, Asa neighed.&#xD;
He would stumble against a desk and nigh ; he would run head-&#xD;
long against the wall and neigh ; he would lift up one, foot and&#xD;
neigh ; he would put it down, take up the other and neigh; and&#xD;
then when he would attempt to lift up both feet at once, he would fall&#xD;
down and neigh. Never 'before had Asa so well acted his part in&#xD;
the horsin' at the Goosepond. Never before had horse, with such&#xD;
odds on 'his back, neighed so lustily. Sam screamed and kicked'&#xD;
Asa pranced and neighed, until at last, stumbling +iolently against&#xD;
the bench, Sam  let go his hold upon his neck, for fear of breaking&#xD;
his own, and fell sprawling on his belly under a desk. Mr. Meadows&#xD;
burst into a paroxysm pf laughter. His soul was satisfied. He gave&#xD;
up the pursuit and ordered them to their seats. They went to thorn&#xD;
and sat down upon them with such a graduated declension of body,&#xD;
as one would knowingly sit withal into a basket of eggs.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
After the close of the last performance which Mr. Meadows face-&#xD;
tieously caed horsin,' he rested about ten minutes. The most in.&#xD;
teresting, the most delightful, the most inspiriting exercise was yet&#xD;
to flow. This was the punishment of Brinkly Glisson. It was&#xD;
&#xD;
~KK&#xD;
&#xD;

uni"MOEOrs TALES.&#xD;
strange to see how he delighted in it. He was never so agreeable&#xD;
at playtime, and in the afternoon, as, when he had beaten Brinkly in&#xD;
the morning. If he recited his lesson, and there was no other pre-.&#xD;
text to beat him, Mr. Meadows was sadder and more peevish than usual&#xD;
during the remainder of the'day, and looked and acted as a man who&#xD;
felt that he was deeply injured. Now Brinkly was one of the best,&#xD;
and bravest, and honestest boys in the world. He was the only son&#xD;
of a widow, who had, at great sacrifice, sent him to Mr. Meadows'&#xD;
school. He had pitched and tended the crop of a few acres around&#xD;
her house, and she had secured the promise of a neighbor to he! p&#xD;
her to gather it when ripe, and thus afforded her son an opportunity&#xD;
of getting, as she said, ' little schooling. He was the apple of her&#xD;
eye-the idol of her .heart. He was to her as we always think of&#xD;
him of whom it is said, 'He is the only son of his mother, and she is&#xD;
a widow.' The sacrifice she had to make, she made cheerfully; 'for&#xD;
she loved him as she loved her own soul. And Brinkly had ever re&#xD;
paid that fond mother's care, by the most constant love and duty.&#xD;
He soon learned, to read tolerably at the school, and was advanced&#xD;
into geography in a couple of months. How proud the widow was&#xD;
when she bought the new geography and atlas, with the proceeds of&#xD;
the sale' of four pairs of socks; which (sweet labor of love!) she had&#xD;
knit with her own hands. What a world of knowledge, she thought,&#xD;
there must be in a book with five times as many pages as a spell-&#xD;
ing book, and in tiose great red, blue, and pink pictures, covering&#xD;
a whole page a foot square, and all this knowledge to become the&#xD;
property ff Brinkly! !But Brinkly soon found that geography was&#xD;
above has present capacity, and so told Mr. Meadows.- That gen-&#xD;
tleman received the communication with displeasure ; said that&#xD;
what was the matter with him was laziness, and that laziness, of all&#xD;
the qualities whiehla boy had, was the one which he knew best what&#xD;
.do with.  H then took to beating him. Brinkly, after the lirst&#xD;
eating, which Was a light one, went home and told his mother of it,&#xD;
and intimated his intention not to take another. The widow was&#xD;
sor 1ly disreesed, aid knew not what'to do. On' the one hand was&#xD;
her grief' to kow her son was unjustly beaten, and his spirit sowed ;&#xD;
er she knew that he studied all the irme he had, and though unu-&#xD;
&#xD;
)UIMOROUs TALES.&#xD;
cated herself, she was not like many other l);11euts of heir day, who&#xD;
thought that 'the best means to develope the mind, was to heat the&#xD;
body. But, on the other hand, would be the disappointment ofhis&#xD;
getting an education if he should leave the school, there being then&#xD;
no other in the neighborhood. This, thought the poor wonaa, was&#xD;
the worse horn of the dilemma ;' and so she wept, and begged him ,&#xD;
as he loved her, to submit to Mr. Meadows. He should have the&#xD;
more time for study. She would chop the wood and feed the stock.&#xD;
He should have all the time at home to himself. He could get it&#xD;
she knew he could. It would coite to him after awhile.&#xD;
Brinkly yielded ; but how many a hard struggle he'made to con-&#xD;
tinue that submission, no one knew but he,-not even his mother,&#xD;
for he concealed from her, as much as he could, the treatment which&#xD;
4r j     he had received and the -suffering  which he had    endured.&#xD;
Mr. Meadows could see this struggle sometimes.    He knew&#xD;
that the boy was not afraid of him. . He saw it in his eye&#xD;
every time he beat him, and it was this which afforded- him such a&#xD;
satisfaction to beat him. He wished to subdue him, and he had not&#xD;
succeeded. Brinkly would never beg nor weep. Mr. Meadows&#xD;
often thought he was on the point of resisting him; but he knew&#xD;
the reason why he did not, and while he hated him for it, he trusted&#xD;
that it would last. Yet, he often doubted whether it would or not, and&#xD;
thus the matter became so intensely exciting, that he continually&#xD;
sought for opportunities of bringing it up. He loved to tempt hjm.&#xD;
He had no doubt but that he could easily manage him in an even&#xD;
combat; but he did not wish it to come -to that.  He only gloried in&#xD;
goading him almost to resistance, and then seeing him yield.&#xD;
Hr    o'eno all seen how the showman adapts himself to&#xD;
the different animals of the menagerie. How quickly and&#xD;
sharply he speaks to the lesser animals who jump over his&#xD;
wand and back, and over and back again, and then crouch in&#xD;
subnssion as lie passes by. But'when he goes to the lion,&#xD;
you can scarcely hear his low tones, as he commands him to&#xD;
friend perform his part, and is not certain, whether the kingr&#xD;
of the beasts w  do as lie is bidden or not. Doubts like these&#xD;
were in the mind of Mr. Meadows, when he was about to set&#xD;
upon Brikly Glisson ;sbut the greater thes9 doubts the more&#xD;
he enjoyed thie trial. After a short rest fromn the tatigues .of&#xD;

Jhe last exercise, darig which he curiously and seriously eyed&#xD;
the lad, he rose from his seat, paced slowly across the  oo&#xD;
once or twice, and taking a hickory switch, the longest ofr all&#xD;
he had, he stopped in the middle of the floor, and in a low&#xD;
quiet tone, said :&#xD;
'Brinkly Glisson, come.&#xD;
Allen had been eyeing Brinkly all the time, since the elos&#xD;
of $he circus. He saw the conflict which was going on in his&#xD;
soul, and when Mr. Meadows had burst into  eparoxysm o&#xD;
laughter, at the uintoward ending of the bhorsin, he thought he&#xD;
saw that'the conflict was ended:&#xD;
Slowly and calmly Brinkly rose from his seat, and walked&#xD;
up nd stood before Mr. Meadows.&#xD;
y Why, hi!' thought Allen.&#xD;
tOff with your coat, sir,'-low and gentle, and with a coun-&#xD;
tenance almost smiling. Brinkly stood 'otionesr  utance&#xD;
had done so onec or twice before, in similar circumstances,&#xD;
and at length yielded. 'Off with it, sir,'-louder and not so&#xD;
gentle. No motion on Brikly's part, not even in his eyes,&#xD;
which looked steadily into the master's, with a meaning which&#xD;
he nearly but not quite understood.&#xD;
Aint' you going to pull off that coat, sir?'&#xD;
'What for ?' asked Brinkly.&#xD;
'What for, sir?'&#xD;
'Yes, sir ; what for?'&#xD;
*Becausei am going to give you this hickory,.you i -puient&#xD;
scoundrel; and if you don t pull it off this minute, Igve&#xD;
you sich a beating' as'll make you feel like you never was&#xD;
wl:ped before since you was born. Aint yourgoing to pul&#xD;

'No, sir.'hte ul&#xD;
Allenlwrigged n his seat, nd his face shone as the ull&#xD;
mo'on. M.Meadows retreated a step, and'ig his ski&#xD;
two feet from the larger end, he raised that end to strike.&#xD;
tlop one minute if you Please.'&#xD;
r. Meadows lowered his arm, and his face siled a tri-&#xD;
u ph. This wasthe first t  e lrinkly had ever begged. He&#xD;
cb ekked. Allen looked    pointed.&#xD;

would'nt besurprised if it war'nt sorter heavy. Will you pull&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Meadows, I 'asked you to stop, because I wanted to y&#xD;
a ew words to you. You have beat me and beat ime, worse&#xD;
than you ought to beat a dog,' (Allen's face getting right&#xD;
again;) and God in heaven knows that, in the time that have&#xD;
come to school to jou, I have tried as hard as a boy ever did,&#xD;
to please you and get my .lessons. I can't understand that&#xD;
geography, and I aint been reading long enough to understand&#xD;
it. I have, asked you to let me quit. Mother has asked you.'&#xD;
You would'nt do it; but beat me, and beat me, and beat me,&#xD;
(there: is no telling whether Allen wants to laugh or to cry),'&#xD;
and now, the more I study it, the more I don't understand it.&#xD;
I:would have quit school long ago, but mother was so anxious&#xD;
for me to learn, and made me come. Aid now, I have took&#xD;
off my coat to you. the last time.' (Ai! now there is a great&#xD;
tear in Allen's eye,'. 'Listen to me,' (as the teacher's hand&#xD;
makes a slight' motion,) 'don't strike me, I know I'm  not&#xD;
learning anything, and your beating aint .going to make me&#xD;
learn any faster. If you art determined to keep me in this&#xD;
geography, and to beat me, just say so, and I'll take m hat&#xD;
and books and go home. I'd like to not come to-day, ut I&#xD;
thought I knew my lesson. Now, I say again, don'tfor God's&#xD;
sake, don't str&amp;amp;e me.' And he raised up.both his hands,. pale&#xD;
and trembling.&#xD;
It would be impossible to describe the surprise and rage ex-&#xD;
pressed on the faeon"of Mr. Meadows during the delivery, and&#xD;
at the close of this little harangue. He oe kc  at 'the Tboy a&#xD;
moment. His countenance expoesel thl deepest sadness ;&#xD;
but there was nothing in it lik" r;e  or threatening. It&#xD;
was simply sad and beseenig. The master raised his switch&#xD;
and struck with all his might across his shoulders.&#xD;
'My God!' cried the boy; but in an instant sadness and be-&#xD;
seeching passed from his face. The long pent up resentment of&#xD;
his soul shed forth, and the fury of a demon glared from his&#xD;
eyes.  e was preparing to spring upon Mr. Meadows, when&#xD;
the latter, by a sudden rush, caught 'm and thrust him back-&#xD;
ward over the front bench. They bothtumbled on the floor,&#xD;
between the rows of desks, Mr. Meadows uppermost.&#xD;
'It's come,' said Allen, quietly, as he rose atd looked down&#xD;
upon the combatants.&#xD;
Mr. Meadows attempted to disengage himsir' and ise; but&#xD;
Brinkly would rise with hin. After several attempts at this,&#xD;

Brinkly managed to get upon one knee, and by a violent jerk,&#xD;
to bring Mr. Meadows . down". upon    the floor, where&#xD;
they were, in the phraseology of. the wrestling ring,&#xD;
cross and pile. Mr. Meadows shouted to two or three of the&#xD;
boys to hold Brinkly until he could rise. They rose to obey,&#xD;
but Allen, without saying a word, put out his hand before&#xD;
them, and motioning them to their seats, they resumed them.:&#xD;
And now the contest .set in for good. Mr. Meadows strug-&#xD;
ling to recover his advant age, and Brinkly to improve what&#xD;
he had gained. The former s right arm was thrown acx ops the&#xD;
latter's neck, his right hand wound m and pulhng vioently&#xD;
his hair, while his left hand pressed agaimsthis breast. Brink-&#xD;
ly 'sleft leg was across Mr. 1Ieadows' middle and with his&#xD;
right against a stationary desk, his right arm bent and lying&#xD;
under him like a blizzard's, and his left in Mr. Meadows' shirt&#xD;
collar, he struggled to get uppermost. When Mr. Meadows'&#xD;
upper parts were rising, and about .to rule  the ascendant,&#xD;
Brinkly's lower parts would swell like a sea wave. Between&#xD;
these two the strife was even ; and 'it was plain the natter&#xD;
would have to be settled by Mr. Meadows' lower parts. and&#xD;
Brinkly's upper parts. Yet, whn Brinkly would attempt to&#xD;
raise his head, that hand wound in his hair would instantly&#xD;
bring it back' to- the floor. When Mr. Meadows would at-&#xD;
tempt to disengage himself from underneath Brinkly's leg,&#xD;
that member, assisted by its' brother from the desk, against&#xD;
which it was pressed, held it like the  boa holds- the bullock.&#xD;
Oh, Mr. Meadows ! Mr. Meadows ! You don't know the boy&#xD;
that grapples with you. You blow, Mr. Meadows! 'See!&#xD;
Blinkly blows not half so hard. Remember, you walk a mile&#xD;
to and from the school, and Brinkly seven,.often running the&#xD;
first half. Besides, there is something in Brinkly's soul which&#xD;
will not let him tire. Theremembrance of long continued&#xD;
wrongs, which cannot lQnger be borne; the long subdued but&#xD;
'ow inextinguishable desire of revenge; every hostile feeling&#xD;
but fear---all these are now dominant in that simple but heroic&#xD;
heart, and"if you1hope to conquer, you must fight as you never&#xD;
have fought before, and never may have to fight again.&#xD;
Your right hand pulls less vigorously at the hair of Brink-&#xD;
ly's ascending head. Look there ! Brinkly's leÂ° has moved&#xD;
an inch further across you ! Wring and turst, M7r. Meadows,&#xD;
for . right under that leg, if any where for you, is now the post&#xD;
of honor. Can't you draw out your left leg, and plant it&#xD;

&#xD;
against the desk behind you, as Brinkly does with his right.&#xD;
Alas ! no. Brinkly has now mnade-a hook of his left, and his&#xD;
heel is pressing close in'the cavity behind your knee. Ah !&#xD;
that was an unlucky move for you then, Mr. Meadows, when&#xD;
you let Brinkly's hair go, and thrust both of your hands at his&#xD;
eyes. You must have done that in a passion. But you are&#xD;
raking him some now, that is certain. But see there, now !&#xD;
he has released his grasp at your shirt collar, and thrown his&#xD;
left arm over you. Good morning to you now, Mr. Meadows !&#xD;
-"In the instant that Mr. Meadows had released his'hold upon&#xD;
his hair, Brinkly, though he was beige gouged terribly) re-&#xD;
''' ' '  leased his hold upon his collar, threw  -arm over his neck,&#xD;
and pushing with all his might with his right leg against the&#xD;
desk, and making a corresponding pull with-his left, he suc-&#xD;
ceeded in getting fully upon him; then, springing up quick as&#xD;
lightning, as Mr. Meadows, panting, his eyes gleaming with&#xD;
the fury of an enraged tigress, was attempting to rise, he dealt&#xD;
him a blow in the face with his fist, which sent him back bleed-&#xD;
ing like a butchered beast. Once more the master attempted&#xD;
to rise, and those who. saw it will never forget that piteous&#xD;
spectacle of rage, and shame, and pain, and fear. Once more&#xD;
Brinkly struck him back. How that brave boy's face shone&#xD;
. ut with those gadia certamini, which the brave always feel&#xD;
when in the midst of an inevitable and righteous combat !&#xD;
Springing up on his adversary again and seizin 'his arms and&#xD;
y.      pinioning them under his knees, he wound 1is hands in his&#xD;
r. shaggy hair, and raising his head, thrust it down several times&#xD;
with all his might against the floor.&#xD;
S'Spare me! for God's sake, spare me!' cried Mr. Meadows,&#xD;
in tones never before heard from him in that house.&#xD;
Brinkly stopped. 'Spare you,' he said, now panting him-&#xD;
self. 'Yes ! you who never spared anything that you could&#xD;
hurt ! . Poor cruel coward ! You loved to beat other people,&#xD;
and gloried in seeing them  suffering, and when they begged&#xD;
you to spare them, you laughed.--you did. And now, you are&#xD;
beat ,yourself and whipped, you beg like a dog. Yes, and I&#xD;
-w111spare you,' he continued, rising from him. 'It would be a&#xD;
pity to beat any such a poor cowardly human as you are any&#xD;
longer. Now go ! and make them poor things there go to&#xD;
horsin again, and cut 'em in two again; and then git in the&#xD;

they cry like you, and" beg you to spare 'em, do you laugh&#xD;

He rose. and t raed away from him. Gathering up his&#xD;
boQks he went to'the peg whereon his hat was hanging, and&#xD;
was in the act of taking it down, when a sudden revulsion of&#xD;
feeling came over him, and he sat down, and wept.&#xD;
oh! the feelings in that poor boy's breast! The recollection&#xD;
of the cruel wrongs which he had suffered; of the motives so&#xD;
ful of pious duty, which had made him  endure them, the&#xD;
"  ought of how migeen had been the wish of his mother thatJ&#xD;
lie sold endure'them; and then of how terribly they had'&#xD;
been avenged. These all meeting at once in his gentle but un-&#xD;
taught sprit overcame it, and broke it into weeping.&#xD;
Meanwhile other things were going on. Mr. Meadows, hiag-&#xD;
ard, brui ed, bleeding, covered with dirt, slank off twyr g&#xD;
a e fire-place, sat down in his chair, and buried his face in his&#xD;
1ands. The pupils had been in the highest states of alternate&#xD;
alarm and astonishment. They were now , all standing aont&#xD;
their seats, looking alternately at Blinkly and .Mr. Meadows,}ut&#xD;
't at the latter mostly. .Their countenance plainly indicated that&#xD;
this was a sight which, in their minds,'had never before been&#xD;
vouchsafed tQ mortal vision. .;A schoolmaster whipped ! beat !&#xD;
choked!. his head hmbed:and that by one of his pupils.&#xD;
And that school stet C.rMeadows! Mr. Meadows, who&#xD;
ten minutes before, had been in the ,exercise of sovereign and&#xD;
despotic authority. And then- to hear him beg! A school-&#xD;
master !-4Ir. Meadows!-to hear him  actually beg Brinkly&#xD;
pare him    These pooi children actually began to feel not&#xD;
onyr pity, but some- resentment at what had been done. They&#xD;
wee terrified,; and to some extent miserable at the sight of so&#xD;
'mci h power, so much authority, so much royalty dishonored&#xD;
and laid low. -Brinkly seemed to them- to have transformed.&#xD;
lie was a murdere't! a, regicide!! Talk of the divine right of&#xD;
kings. 'There was never more reverence felt. for it than the&#xD;
children in country selools'felt for the kingly dignity of the&#xD;
schoolmaster of forty years agone.&#xD;
&#xD;
oAPTER     'sI.&#xD;
Allen Thigpen was the only one of the pupils who did not entirely lose hi&#xD;
wits while the events of the last few minute; were transpiring. While the&#xD;
contest was even between the combatants, he stood gazing-down upon them&#xD;
with the most intenseinterest. His body was bent down slightly, and his armi&#xD;
were extended in a semi cireie, as if to exclude the rest of the world from a. scene&#xD;
which he considered all his own. When Mr..Meadows called for quarters,&#xD;
Aflen folded his arms across his breast, and to a tune, which was meant for&#xD;
'Auld Lang Sync,' and which sounded indeed more like that than any other, ho&#xD;
A       sang as he turned off, about half of the line beginning with&#xD;
&#xD;
'Jerusalem, my happy home,'&#xD;
When Mr. Meadows had taken his seat, he looked at him for a moment or two&#xD;
as if hesitating what to do. He therm walked slowly to him end delivered the&#xD;
following oration:&#xD;
'It's come to it at last, jest as I sail. I seen it from the fast ; you ought to&#xD;
a seen it yourself, but you woald'nt ue you could'nt, and I don't know which,&#xD;
and it makes no odds which, you did'qt. I did, and now its come, and sich a&#xD;
beatin, Jerusalem ! But don't you be too much took back by it. You war'at&#xD;
goin to keep school here no longern to-day, nohow, Now, I had laid off in my&#xD;
mind to have gin you a duckin this very day ; and I'll tell you for why. Not as&#xD;
I've got anything particklar agin you, myself ; you have not said one word out&#xD;
of the way to me this whole term. But, in the fist place, its not my opinion,&#xD;
nor haint been for sometime, that you are bitten too be a schoolmaster. Thar's&#xD;
them sans in intrust--intrust is the very thing and the onliest thing I wanted&#xD;
to learn-I say, thar's them sums in intrust, which I can't work and which you&#xD;
can't show me how to work, or haint yit,,though I've been cypherin in it now&#xD;
two months. And thar's Mely Jones, that's in the same, and she haint learnt&#xD;
'em neither, and dinged if I believe ll the fault's in me and her, and in course it&#xD;
can't be in the book. But that aint the main thing i its yoir-impouin disposi-&#xD;
tion. If this here school-house,' he continued, 'looking around, 'if this here&#xD;
school-house haint seen more unmercitul beatin than any other sehool-house in&#xD;
this country, then, I say its a pity that thar's any sich a thing as education-&#xD;
And if the way things has been oar'd on in this here school-house, sense you&#xD;
you've been in it is the onliest way of getting ofr a education, then -i say again,&#xD;
its apity thar's sich a thing. It paint worUi while for me to name over all the ways&#xD;
you've had of tormentin o' these children. You know 'em; I know 'em; every.&#xD;
body about this here school-house J nows 'em. Now, as I said before, I had Idid of&#xD;

his mother. Now I've been thinking o' this for more'n two weeks, bekase--&#xD;
now listen to me ; did'ut you say you was from South Carolina?' =&#xD;
Paising, for, but not receiving an'answer, he continued:&#xD;
'Yes, that's what you said. Well, now I've beam a man-a travelin man-&#xD;
who staid all night at our house on his way to Fluri~day, say he knowed'you.&#xD;
You aint from South Callina ; I wish you was, but, you aint ; you're from&#xD;
Georgy, and I'm ashamed to say it. He ast me, seem  me a studyin, who j&#xD;
went.to school to,'and when I told him, (Mr. Meadows appearing to be listee-&#xD;
ing) Meadows,' says he, 'what Meadows?' 'Iserl' says I. 'Iserl Meadows a&#xD;
school-master, says he ?' and he laughed, he did ; he laughed fit to kill hisself.&#xD;
Well, he told me whar you was raised, and who you was. But you need'nt be&#xD;
too bad steered. I aint told it to the fust human,,and I aint going to tell you&#xD;
leave.' Now, I had laid off, as I told you, to gin you a duekin, but I had'nt&#xD;
the heart to do it, and you in the fix you are now at the, present. Nuff sed, as&#xD;
seed in a bar-room in Augusty on a piece of pasteboard, under the words 'No&#xD;
credit,' when I was thar. Wonder, if thar's going to be' much more schooling&#xD;
here?'          -&#xD;
Saying which; Allen puckered up his mouth as if for a whistle, and stalked&#xD;
-  back to his seat.,&#xD;
Mr. Meadows, during the last few sentences of this harangue, had exhibited&#xD;
evidence of a new emotion. When Allen told him what the traveler had said&#xD;
he looked up with a countenance full of terror, and on Allen assuring him that&#xD;
he had not mentioned it,' he had again buried his face in his hands. When&#xD;
Allen went back to his seat, he rose and beckoning to im imploringly, they&#xD;
went out of the house together a few steps and stopped.  .&#xD;
I never done you any harm,' said. Mr. Meadows.&#xD;
'You never did, certin,.shore,' answered Allen, 'nor no particklar good. But&#xD;
that's neither here nor that ; what do you want?'S&#xD;
'Don't tell what you heard tell I git away.'&#xD;
'Did'nt I say I would'nt ?  But 'you must leave tolerble soon. I can't keep&#xD;
it long. I fairly eech to tell it uow,'S&#xD;
The sehool-master stood a moment, turning his hat i his hands, as if hesi-&#xD;
tkting what sort of leave tQtake. He timidly offered Allen his hand.&#xD;
'I rather not,' said Allen, and for the first time seemed a little embarrassed.&#xD;
Suddenly the man hauled his hat on his head, and walked away. He had just&#xD;
entered the path in the thicket, and turning unobserved, he paused, gnd looked&#xD;
back at the school-house. And oh, the anger, the impotent rage, the chagrin&#xD;
and shame which were depleted on his bloodshot face. -No exiled monarch&#xD;

InMR,n    TALES.                         1&#xD;
ever felt more grief and misery than' he felt at that moment. He paused but&#xD;
for a moment. Then raising both his hands and shaking them towards the&#xD;
house without saying a word, he turned again and almost ran along the path.&#xD;
After he had gone, and not until he had gotten out of sight, Allen, to whom&#xD;
all eyes were turned (except Brinkly's who yet sat with his head hidden in his&#xD;
hands on the bench) took Mr. Meadows' chair, and crossing his legs, said :&#xD;
'Well, boys and gals, the "oosepond it seem are a broke up school. The&#xD;
school-master have, so to speak, absquatulated. Thar's to be no more horsin&#xD;
here ; and the circus are clean shot up. And the only thing I hates about it&#xD;
is thatits Brinkly that's dotne it' and not me. But he would'nt give me a&#xD;
chance. No,' he continued, sorrowfully and as if speaking to himself, 'he&#xD;
.'   would'nt give me a chance. Nary single word, could I ever git him to say to&#xD;
.   me out'of the way. I have kiisted lessons, 'deed I never said none. I never&#xD;
kept nary single rule in his school, and he would'nt say nothing to me.'&#xD;
'Jhen rising and going to Brinkly, he put his hand upon his shoulder.&#xD;
'No, its jest as it ought to a bin ; you was the one tc do it, and in the nare&#xD;
of all that's jest, Brinkly Glisson, what is you been crying about? Git up, boy&#xD;
uand go.and wash your face. I would rather have done what you've done, than&#xD;
to a bin the man that fooled the tory in the Revolutionary War, and stolen his&#xD;
horse in the life of Marion. Come along and wash that face and hands.'&#xD;
And he almost dragged Brinkly to the pail, and poured water while he&#xD;
washed.&#xD;
'The children, recovering from their consternation into which thcy had been&#xD;
thrown by the combat and its result, now began to walk about the house,&#xD;
picking up their books and laying them down again. They would go to the&#xD;
door and look out towards Mr. Meadows' path, as if expecting and indeed, half&#xD;
way hoping, half-way fearing that lie would return; and then. they woul&#xD;
stand around Allen and Brinkly, as the latter was washing and drying himself. But&#xD;
they spoke not a word. Suddenly Allen, mimicking the tone of Mr. Meadows,&#xD;
cried out:")&#xD;
'Asa Boatright and Sam Pate, go to horsin.'&#xD;
= 9 -   In a moment they all burst into shouts of laughter. Asa mounted upon&#xD;
Sam's back,,and Sam pranced.about and neighed, ah, so gail'. Allen got a&#xD;
switch and made as if he would strike Ma, and that young'gentleman for the&#xD;
4  first time in the performance of this interesting exercise, screamed with delight&#xD;
instead of pain.&#xD;
.      'Let Aa be the school-master,' shouted Allen. 'Good morning, Mr. Boat-&#xD;
right,' said he with mock humility. 'Mr. Boatright, may I go out.?' asked&#xD;
timidly, half a dozen boys.&#xD;

Asa dismounted, and seizing a hickory, he tood up in the middle of the flogr&#xD;
and .the others formed the circus around him. Here they came and went,&#xD;
jumping over his switch, and crying out and stooping to rub their legs, and&#xD;
begging him to stop 'for God's sake, Mr. Boattight, stop.'&#xD;
Suddenly an idea' struck Mr. Boatright. Disbanding the circus, he cried&#xD;
out.&#xD;
'You, Is'rl Meadows, come up here, sir. Been a fighten, have you, sir? come&#xD;
up, sir. Oh, here you are.'&#xD;
Mr. Boatright fell upon the teacher's chair, and of all the flogging  which a&#xD;

he indignantly kicked it Out of doors, amid the screams and shouts of his&#xD;
school-fellows.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
'Far you Well,' said Allen, solemnly, to the fallen chair.&#xD;
They now all gathered u p their books and slates, and hats and bonnets, and&#xD;
started off for their several homes. Those who went the' same way with&#xD;
Brinkly, listened with the most respectful attention as he talked with Allen on&#xD;
the way, and . showed how bitterly he had suffered from the cruelty of Mr&#xD;
Meadows.. h      ad already lost their resentment at the dishonor of that&#xD;
monarch' royalty, 'and were evidently regarding Brinkly with the devotion&#xD;
with which mankind always regard rebels who are successful. Each one strove&#xD;
to get the nearest him as he walked. One little fellow, after trying several&#xD;
times to slip in by liis side; got ahead and walked backwards as he looked at.&#xD;
Brinckly and listened. He was so far gone under the old regime that he felt no&#xD;
relief from what had happened. He had evidently not understood anything at&#xD;
all about it. He seemed to be trying to do so, and to make out for certain&#xD;
whether that was Brinkly or not. The voice of those young republicans, had.&#xD;
Brinkly been ambitious, would have made him dictator of the Goosepond.&#xD;
Rven Allen felt a consideration for Brinkly, which was altogether new. He&#xD;
had always expected that Brinkly would at some day resist the master, but he&#xD;
,did not dream of the chivalrous spirit of the lad nor that the resistance when it&#xD;
should come, would be so terrible and disastrous. He had always regarded&#xD;
Brinkly as his inferior; he was now quite satisfied to consider him as no more&#xD;
than his equal. How we all, brave men and cowards, do honor the brave!.&#xD;
&#xD;
HUMOROUS TAIs.&#xD;
And Brinkly had just given, in the opinion of his schbl-fellows, the most&#xD;
brilliant illustration of courage which the world had ever seen.&#xD;
But Brinkly was not ambitious nor vain ; he felt no triumph in his victory.&#xD;
On the contrary, he was sad ; he wished it could have been avoided. He said&#xD;
to Allen that he wished ha could have stood it a little longer.  O&#xD;
'Name o'      Baly Glisson, what for? It is the astonishenist ting I&#xD;
ever heerd of, for yon to be sorry for maulin a rascal who heat you like a dog,&#xD;
and that for nothing. What for, I say again?'&#xD;
'On mother's account.'&#xD;

Saying this, Acen hook hands with him and the others and went ofi, inerriiy&#xD;
singing 'Jerusal: t my happy home.' Soon all the rest had diverged- by by-&#xD;
roads to their'own homes, and Brinkly pursued his way alone.&#xD;
It was about twelve o'cock when he reached home. The widow's house wa.-&#xD;
a single log tenement with a small shed-room behind. A kitchen, a meat-house,&#xD;
a dairy, a crib with two stalls in the rear, one for the horse the other for the&#xD;
cow, were the out buildings. Homely and poor as this little homestead was, ii&#xD;
wore an air of much neatness and comfort. The yard looked clean ; the floors&#xD;
of both mansion and kitchen were clean, and the little dairy lod'ked as if it&#xD;
knew it was clean, but that was nothing new or strange. Several large rost&#xD;
bushes stood on either side of the little gate, ranged along the yard paling.&#xD;
Two rows of pinks and narcissus hedged the walk from the gate to the dooQ&#xD;
whore, on blocks of oak, rested two boxes of the geranium.&#xD;
The widow was in the act of sitting down to her dinner, when hearing the&#xD;
gate open and shut, she advanced to the door to see who might he there. slow-&#xD;
ly and sadly Brinkly advanced to the door.&#xD;
L   'Lord have mercy upon my soul and body, Brinkly, what is the matter with&#xD;
you? and'what have you been a doin, and what made you come from the school.&#xD;
house this time o' day?' was the greeting he met.&#xD;
'Don't be scared, mother; it is'nt much that's the matter with me. Let us&#xD;
sit down by the fire hera, and I'll tell you all about it.'&#xD;
They sat down, and the mother looked upon the son and the son upon the&#xD;
Smether.&#xD;

'I was afraid it would come to it, mother ; God knows how I have tried to&#xD;
keep from doing what I have had to do at last.&#xD;
'Brinkly, have you .gone and fought with Mr. Meadows?'&#xD;
'yes, mother.'&#xD;
'Anmlo ruined yourself and me, too.'&#xD;
'I hope not, mother.'&#xD;
'Yes, here have I worked and denied myself;i day and night I have pinched&#xD;
to give you an education, and this is the way you pay me for i.' and she fell&#xD;
straight to crying.  "&#xD;
'Mother, co listen to me before yea cry and fret any more, and I believe you&#xD;
wiil think I have not done wrong.- Please, Mother, listen to me,' he entreated&#xD;
as she continued to weep, and rocked herself in order, as it seemed, to give en-&#xD;
couragement and keep time to her weeping. But she wept and rocked. Brinkly&#xD;
turned from her and seemed dogedly hopeless.&#xD;
'Say on what you're going to say. Say on what you're going to say. If&#xD;
you've got anything to say, say it.'&#xD;
'I can't tell you anything while you keep crying so- Please don t cry, mother&#xD;
I don't believe you will blame 'me when I tell you what I hava  rn through.,&#xD;
His manner was so humble and'beseeching, that his mother sat till and in a&#xD;
less fretful tone, again bade him go on.&#xD;
'Mother, as I said before, God knows that Ive tried to keep from it, and could&#xD;
not, you ,don't'know, mother, how that man has treated me.'&#xD;
'fIow has he treatedyou ?' she inquired, looking at her son for the first time&#xD;
she had been sitting.&#xD;
'You were so anxious fo: me to learn, and I was so anxious myself to learn,&#xD;
that I have never told you of hardly any of his treatment. Oh, mother, he has&#xD;
beat me worse than anybody ought to beat the meanest dog. He has called me&#xD;
and you poor, and made fun of us because we were poor. He has called me a&#xD;
scoundrel, a beggar, a fool. When I told him that you wanted me to quit&#xD;
geography, he said you was a fool and had a fool for a son, and that he had no&#xD;
doubt that my father was a fool before me.'&#xD;
The widow dried her face with her handkerchief, settled herself in her chair&#xD;
and said : -&#xD;
'When he said them things he told a---what's not so ; I'll say it if he is a&#xD;
school-master.' And she looked as if she was aware that the responsibility of&#xD;
that bold observation was large.&#xD;
'He said,' continued Brinkly, 'that I should study it, nda if I did'nt git the&#xD;
lessons he'd heat me as long as he could fd a hickory to beat me with. I stood&#xD;
it all because it was my only chance to git any schooling. But I told him then&#xD;
&#xD;
-that is when he called you a fool, and father one, too--that it was'nt so, and&#xD;
that he ought not 10 say so. Well, yesterday, you know you sent me by Mr.&#xD;
Norris' to pay batk the ineal we borrowed, and I did'nt get to the school-house&#xD;
quite in time. But he was'nt more than a hundred yards ahead of me, and when&#xD;
he saw me, he hurried just to keep me from being in time. When I told him&#xD;
how you had sent me by Mr. Norris', he only laughed and called me a lIar, and&#xD;
then-look at my shoulder, mother.'&#xD;
He tgok off his coat, unbuttoned his shirt and smr  his shoulder and back,&#xD;
blackened with hideous bruises.&#xD;
'Oh, my son, my poor son, was all that mother could say.&#xD;
She had not, in fact, know 1 a tenth of the cruelties and insults whin Brinkly&#xD;
had borne  lie had frequently' importune her to let him quit the et . But&#xD;
she, supposed that it was because of the dificultis of learning his l, which&#xD;
got for him an occasional punishment, andsuch  was ineinht     life of&#xD;
every school-boy, bad and good, idle and industrious. These thought  dining&#xD;
with her ardeit desire that he should have some learning, even a  'isk of&#xD;
receiving some harsh and even unjust punishment made her permia. ecping&#xD;
him there. Seeing her anxiety. and to avoid making her unhappy, Brmidy had&#xD;
concealed from her the greater part of tih wrongs which he had sufferred.- But&#xD;
when she heard how h1e had been abused, and saw the stripes and bruises upon&#xD;
his body, her mother's heart could not restrain itself, and she wept sorely.&#xD;
Well, mother, I stood this ,too,-but last night I eould'nt sleep. I thought&#xD;
about all he had said and all he had done to me, and I made up my mind to quit&#xD;
him ,any how. But this morning before day I thought, for your sake, F would&#xD;
try it once more. So I got up and studied my lesson here and all the way to&#xD;
the school-house ; and I did know it, mother, or I thought I did, for he would'nt&#xD;
tell me how to pronounce the words, but Allen Thigpen did, and I pronounced&#xD;
tlem just like Allen told me. When I told him that, he called me a liar, and&#xD;
ateras I begged him not to strike me but toilet me go home. But&#xD;
would strike me, and I fought him.'&#xD;
'And you done right. 'Oh, my son, my poor Brinkly! Yes, you are poor,&#xD;
? the poor son of a poor widow ;Ibut I am proud that you have got the heart&#xD;
to t when you are abused and insulted. If 'd known half of what you have&#xD;
haoear, you should have quit his school long ago, you should, Brinckly, my&#xD;
S      darling, that you should. But hew could you expect to fight hini and not le&#xD;
beat to death? Wh didn't you run away from him and come to me? He&#xD;
ul'nt have beat you so where I was.' And she looked as if she felt herself&#xD;
teequite sufficient for the protection of her young.&#xD;
e, I didn't want to run; I could'nt run from such a man ashe is. Once&#xD;
thought I would take my hat and books and come away; but I could not do&#xD;

that without running and I could'nt run; 'yowwould'nt want me to run, would&#xD;
you, mother ?' The widow looked puzzled.&#xD;
'No, but he is so much' bigger than you, that it would'nt a looked exactly&#xD;
like you was a coward ; and then he has hurt you so bad ; my poor Brinkiy,&#xD;
tol don't know how your face is scratched.'&#xD;
I hurt him worse than he hurt me, mother.'&#xD;
vhat ?'&#xD;
'I hurt him worse than he hurt me ; I got the best of it.'&#xD;
'Glory!'&#xD;
'In fact, I whipped him.'&#xD;
'Glory! glory!'&#xD;
'When I had him down-&#xD;
'Brinkly, lid you have him down, my son?&#xD;
'Yes, and he begged me to spare him:  .      -&#xD;
'Glory be to---glory be to-but you did not do it. did you?'  -&#xD;
Yes, mother, as soon as he give up and begged me to stop, I le hiÂ°. n oie.'&#xD;
'T would'nt a done it, certain, shore !'&#xD;
'Yes you would, mother ; if you had seen how he was hurt and how badly&#xD;
he looked, yob would a spared him, I know you would.'&#xD;
'Well, maybe I might ; I suppose it was right, as he was a man grown ad a&#xD;
school-master to boot. Maybe it was best ; maybe it was best-n  aybe [ might&#xD;
a done it too.'&#xD;
She had risen from the chair and was pacing the floor. This new view of&#xD;
Brinckly's relation to his tyrant was one on which she required time for reflec-&#xD;
tion. She evidently felt, however, that as Brinkly had so often been at the&#xD;
bottom in the combat, now,ywhen he had risen to the top, there was no great&#xD;
harm in staying there a little longer. 'But maybe it 'was best ; I reckon now h3&#xD;
won't be quite so brash with his other scholars.'&#xD;
'He will never have another chance.'&#xD;
'What?'&#xD;
'Allen has found out all about him, and where he came from, and says he is a&#xD;
man of bad character. He begged Allen not to say anything about it until he&#xD;
gothis money and could git away.,. So he is quit and the school is broke up.'&#xD;
'Glory ! glory ! hallelujah!' shouted again and sung the mother.&#xD;
Let her shout a'nd sing I Infinite justice, pardon the poor widow for shouting&#xD;
and singing, now, when her only son, though poor and an orphan, though bruised&#xD;
and: mangled, appears to her grand and beautiful as if he were a monarch's so '&#xD;

fortunately, however, it has thus far, from some cause, been&#xD;
impossible for our Legislatures to make a perfect judiciary&#xD;
system. So various are thQ pursuits of men, so complicated&#xD;
are the relations of business and social intercourse, and so&#xD;
subtle are the influences, which control their minds and direct&#xD;
their actions, that our Legislators, even admitting that they&#xD;
have usually been our wisest and best men, have sometimes,&#xD;
as' if to make good the saying, 'that there is nothing perfect&#xD;
under the sun.' enacted l very unwise laws. These laws, our&#xD;
judges not being invested by the constitution with power to&#xD;
change thetn, have had occasions to , declare to be in full force&#xD;
as long as they remain' unrepealed. But many of those who&#xD;
have been dissatisfied with the judgments which seem so&#xD;
blameable, are wont, in their hasty indignation, to attribute all&#xD;
the consequences of erroneous legislation to the circumstances&#xD;
of there being an- institution called. 'A Supreme Court for the&#xD;
correction of Errors.' If we hear that, away down in a Wire-&#xD;
grass county, where there is not much of anything good to eat&#xD;
but beef, a hungry lout has stolen a yearling, and been ac-&#xD;
qutitel on the trial of the indictment of a jury, the foreman&#xD;
of which had a hind quarter to himself, too cheap and asked&#xD;
no questions, rhy, there is the Supreme Court! Why" don't&#xD;
it stop such things? If an evil disposed person is guilty.of&#xD;
malicious mischief, or an owner of a tippling shop keeps it open&#xD;
on the Sabbath day, and a young solicitor, who has been six&#xD;
months or a year at the bar, does not know how to prosecute&#xD;
these offences, and they go unpunished. Why there now!&#xD;
didn'tI tell you so? Can you expect anything else as long as&#xD;
we have a Supreme Courty? If a good man's daugher, thir-&#xD;
teen years old, is stolen, hurried before a Justice of the Peace,&#xD;
and in five minutes' time made the wife of a vagabond-good&#xD;
Heavens I Is there no law, to prevent such outrages against&#xD;
the happiness of parents and the yell being of society. None-&#xD;

whole concern. _ We shall never have any peace again until&#xD;
we get back to the good.old times under which our fathers&#xD;
lived.&#xD;
Well, those Old times -were very good in many respects&#xD;
Beef was Cheap, and the temptation to steal it was small. Men&#xD;
did not often commit malicious mischief, or keep open tip-&#xD;
pling houses on forbidden days, because land was not high,&#xD;
people lived more widely apart, and every one kept his own&#xD;
liquor at home, gave to his neighbor, and received from his&#xD;
neighbor as much as they wished.; and, except upon Sundays,&#xD;
when they went to church, all got drunk as often as they&#xD;
pleased. Nor did maids of thirteen very often run off with&#xD;
vagabonds; because, fortunately for themselves, they were&#xD;
kept at home with their mothers at that age, and knew no bet-&#xD;
ter than to obey them; while what few vagabonds there were&#xD;
were wont, in the small developement which the credit system&#xD;
had undergone, to carry upon there' persons the unmistakable&#xD;
badges of their profession.&#xD;
It is pleasing to an old man, like me, to recur to those times.&#xD;
Corn, twenty cents a bushel, except to wagoners, who being&#xD;
strangers, and considering that their silver might prove to be&#xD;
pewter, were made to pay a quarter of a dollar. Bacon  no&#xD;
price at all, because everybody had a plenty, ani because the&#xD;
woods were full of game, and the creeks were Â§ull of 'fis&#xD;
Blessed be the memory of those old ties ! The most of those&#xD;
who were then my "friends and eo-v unre gone, and I&#xD;
am left almost alone. But _jr dejrecollection of what they&#xD;
were to me, I say again, blessed be the memory of those old&#xD;
times!&#xD;
But like all other times, they had their evils and their wants.&#xD;
Men and systems were not perfect even then. True, they had not&#xD;
many schools, and they had no Supreme      Court. And&#xD;
yet, 'in what schools and courts they did have there&#xD;
were many things, which, when men thought ul-on them at all&#xD;
they thought might as well have been done differently or left&#xD;
undone. The schools had ways of righting themselves. The&#xD;
thins done in them, though seriously inconvenient at the time&#xD;
doig were not 'very- serious in their consequences.&#xD;

CHAPTERII. I.~&#xD;
A young man, a native of Virginia, and a graduate o the&#xD;
law-school in the University of that State, had come to Geor-&#xD;
gia for the purpose of seeking a home and practising his profes-&#xD;
sion. One morning, inthe beginning of spring, in company&#xD;
with a middle-aged gentleman, whose acquaintance he had&#xD;
. newly made, he rode towards the village near which the latter&#xD;
resided, for the purpose of being introduced to some of the mem-&#xD;
bers'of the Bar residing there. As the two were riding along,&#xD;
after some conversation upon the practice of law and other pur-&#xD;
suits in the South, the younger gentleman asked of the elder if&#xD;
there'was in the South a Court of Errors.&#xD;
'I do not remember to have so heard, but I presume that&#xD;
you have such a Court.'&#xD;
'Yes, indeed,' exclaimed the elder, 'many a one. We have&#xD;
no other sort in Georgia.. But I know what you mean,.sir,' he&#xD;
added, seeing the young man's surprise. 'I answered your&#xD;
question literally, because what I say is very nearly literally&#xD;
true, and it is so doubtless.because wehave no court foh *cor-&#xD;
rection of errors which those we do have continually Coiri it.&#xD;

- vas admittedtd the Bar. I' never practiced, and yet :ve&#xD;
&#xD;
HUMOROUS TALEs.                 41&#xD;
esei enough to know that, with our present judiciary system,&#xD;
the law can never become a science settled upon any ascer&#xD;
tained principles.'&#xD;
'There can-be very little doubt as to that.'&#xD;
'We have no lack of lawyers of real ability, but I doubt it&#xD;
there is. i the South another Srate so deficient in its judiciar&#xD;
as ours. We have, as I said, many able lawyers, but seldom&#xD;
an able Judge. The salary is so small that a lawyer of first&#xD;
rate ability, iuless he be a man of property, ('and such men,'&#xD;
he added, in parenthesis, with a slight touch of dignity which"&#xD;
did not escape the other, 'rarely enter the professions,') will not&#xD;
go upon the lBench. It is, therefore, generally occupied by men&#xD;
ofinferior learning and ability; and as we have no Supreme&#xD;
Court, and each is independent in his circuit, there is of course&#xD;
no uniformity in their decisions, but many an error you may be&#xD;
sure. I reside here near the boundaries of three circuits. I and&#xD;
my neighbors of'two adjoining counties, live under three diffe-&#xD;
rent systems of laws. I am tolerably posted on that of my&#xD;
own circuit, but I dare not move out of it, as I have known&#xD;
others to do to their sorrow. Even here, whenever a new&#xD;
judge is elected, we shall have a new system to learn; for, like&#xD;
every schoolmaster who begins by throwing out of the school-&#xD;
room  all the text books which his predecessor employed he&#xD;
will fear that he will be considered as nobody unless he over-&#xD;
rules- much of what our present judge has decided.'&#xD;
'Does not your constitution provide- for a Supreme Court?&#xD;
'It does, but, bless you sir, the people are almost unanimous-&#xD;
ly  osed to its beig established. They say that they are&#xD;
ready to much worried by Courts to think of making any&#xD;
more of them. The lawyers too, the most of them, are equally&#xD;
opose to it, because they know-.hang them, and who should&#xD;
knows well as they-that it would lessen !itigation by lessen-&#xD;
ang what is to them the glorious uncertainty of the law. A&#xD;
fanwho would get an office here must not open his mouth in&#xD;
favor of a Supreme Court. He had as' well avow himself a&#xD;
disciple of Alexander Hamilton, or a friend of the administra-&#xD;
tion of John Adams.'&#xD;
They had just reached the public square and alighted, when&#xD;
Mr. Parknson pointed to a little office on the corner of it, into&#xD;
which two men Were entering.&#xD;
'There go two limbs of the law now. \Ve will go in at once.&#xD;

HUMOROUS TALES.&#xD;
&#xD;
and leading the way he walked in and introduced the young&#xD;
man, Mr. Overton, to Mr. Sandidge and Mr. Mobley.&#xD;
Mr Sandidge, ('Elam Sandidge, Attorney at Law,' Over-&#xD;
ton had read upon a shingle as he entered,) was about fifty&#xD;
years old ; tall, with very 'long legs, which seemed as if they&#xD;
were ashamed of his rather short body, from the fact that they&#xD;
would never hold it straight up. He had long arms, long&#xD;
hands, and long fingers, which last never looked clean. He&#xD;
-'ore shabby clothes too, which, if they had been ever so fine,&#xD;
Wottld yet have looked shabby for a habit he had of chewing&#xD;
tobacco all the time when he was not eating or asleep, and spit-&#xD;
ting' on himself. Yet, for all these drawbacks, Mr. Sandidge&#xD;
hbld, as it seemed, an ambition to appear perfectly and univer-&#xD;
sally agreeable. His countenance; when he looked at another,&#xD;
was invariably 'clothed in smiles. He never laughed, he.oly&#xD;
smiled. While nature had given him no very acute sense of&#xD;
the humorous; and while, therefore, he never felt like laugh..-&#xD;
in, he had, .apparently from a 'sense of duty, learned to smile,&#xD;
and he smiled at everything. If one said 'good morning' to&#xD;
him, he was sure to smile as he returned the salutation. If&#xD;
one, in answer to an inquiry concerning his health, complained&#xD;
of a headache, he smiled the most cordial sympathy. There&#xD;
bras no cnsiderable amount of cheer conveyed by his smiles-&#xD;
no more than there was b  his shabby coat and hands; but&#xD;
like. these they were a part oflhim, and one got used to them&#xD;
But whoever said anything funny where he and others were&#xD;
standing, and no person laughed except Sandidge, who was&#xD;
_sure to smile, he felt cut up.&#xD;
When Mr1 Parkinson introduced Mr. Overton, :Mr. Sandidge&#xD;
arose and extended his hand with a smile, which seemed', to&#xD;
say 'Ah I-you young dog ! You have come at last . Iknew&#xD;
you would.'&#xD;
Mr. Mobley was a stout, fine looking man, about twenty-three&#xD;
years of ageof the middle height, with dark complexion, very&#xD;
black hair and whiskers, and a fine mouth, full of large sound&#xD;
teeth of perfect whiteness. There was an ease and grace in his&#xD;
manner, and an expression upon his face which marked him at&#xD;
once to Mr. Overton as a well educated and talented man. Im-&#xD;
mediately after the introduction Mr. Sandidge 'looked at the&#xD;
new comers and then at Mr. Mobley with a smile, which the&#xD;
latter interpreted tt once; and after an exchange of a few words&#xD;
of civility, he rose to go.&#xD;
&#xD;
1,&#xD;
&#xD;
IUMoRoUs TALES.&#xD;
'No, do not leave, Mr. Mobley,'   Mr. Parkinson .aid.&#xD;
'We have no especial business with Mr. Sandidge, but came to&#xD;
see you both. So please to remain, unless you have business&#xD;
which calls you away presently.&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge smiles upon Mr. Mobley as he resumecthis seat ;&#xD;
and but that we knew that he was bound to smile at all events,&#xD;
we should have suspected that he was infinitely amused by the&#xD;
idea that Mr. Mobley should have, had any business of such&#xD;
pressing importance as to require him to go to it ina hurry. He&#xD;
then turned to Mr. Parkinson and smiled inquirinly, for this&#xD;
was the first time that that gentleman had ever ea led on him,&#xD;
except upon business..&#xD;
'Mr. Overton has removed to Georgia with a view of be-&#xD;
coming- located permanently somewhere in the State in the&#xD;
practice of the law ;. and 1 have brought hin here to make him&#xD;
acquainted with you both, knowing that he could obtain from&#xD;
you more of suchinformation as he needs than he could from&#xD;
myself; besides,' he added, looking at Mr..Mobley, 'I desired to&#xD;
give him n opportunity of extending his acquaintance among&#xD;
those with whom he might spend pleasantly such of his leisure&#xD;
as he will have when he is wearied with the dullness of Ches-&#xD;
.G            '&#xD;

Mr. Mobley boved ; Mr. Parkinson rose, and saying that&#xD;
he would return 'in an hour, left the office, Mr. Sandidge smiling&#xD;
at him all the while, even at his back as he went out. A con-&#xD;
versation was begun at once between the young men, with an&#xD;
occasional but rare contribution from Mr.'Sandidge. The lat-&#xD;
ter was no great talker in a social way. It wad a wonderful&#xD;
thin to him how many things people could find to say to one&#xD;
another on matters of no business whatever, but only in the way&#xD;
of civility. He could talk forever on business, and in the Court&#xD;
house often made speeches of two hours length. He. under-&#xD;
stood such things mighty well ; but it puzzled him to see two&#xD;
persons sitting down together. and talking for hours on miscel-&#xD;
laneous subjects, sporting from  one to another with perfect&#xD;
ease, having no apparent motive except ;a desire in each to en-&#xD;
tertain the other. There was Mobley now, he would think,&#xD;
a young man, who in the Court house was as skittish as a girl,&#xD;
whose practice, though he had fine education and ability, after&#xD;
a year's pursuit of it, was barely supporting him, and yet, as&#xD;
soon as lie was out of that dread place, and in the society of&#xD;
the iost intelligent and able of the profession, he would 'bear&#xD;

HUMOROUs TALE%.               45&#xD;
&#xD;
his part in the discussion of general subjects, and even of legal&#xD;
questions; with an ease and fluency which made him the most&#xD;
interesting of then all; and the object of'the especial envy of&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge. Being no philosopher, Mr. Sandidge could not,&#xD;
for the life of him, understand how these things could be \and&#xD;
it seemed to him tp be not only strange, but wrong that Mr.&#xD;
Mobley, whom he was accustomed to runt over in the Court&#xD;
house, should not .only seem to be, but should actually be&#xD;
above hiin everywhere else. And yet such things- have been&#xD;
beforeand since, and are to be hereafter, and have excited the&#xD;
surprise of others besides Mr. Sandidge. 'How many young&#xD;
men of excellent talents and the most finished education, have&#xD;
for a year or two striven in vain to begin successfully careers&#xD;
at the bar, and have at length shrunk from  tlie pursuit, and&#xD;
left its honors and emoluments to be gathered by the San-&#xD;
didges ! The Sandidges whom men laughed at when they saw&#xD;
them enter the profession, and whom they contined to laugh&#xD;
at for half a dozen years, and after half ad dozen more years&#xD;
have carried them ill their eases, and have at last lived to see&#xD;
them rich and prosperous. Mr. Sandidge would not ' have&#xD;
thought of exchanging places with Mr. Mobley, or the tine&#xD;
young fellow who had been just now introduced to-him; but&#xD;
the more they ran on with each other abgut law, literature and&#xD;
what -not, the more he wandered at and envied what he thought&#xD;
was their only dift. .But he smiled whenever anything was&#xD;
said to him, or he was expected to say ann did say anything to&#xD;
them. When Mr. Overton inquired if there was much litigation&#xD;
in that circuit; and if money was to be made by the practice,&#xD;
Mr. Mobley slightly blushed, looked at' Mr. Sandidge, and an-&#xD;
swered that there was not a great amount of litigation then&#xD;
originating; and that Mr. Sandidge knew more as to what was&#xD;
to be made by the practice than himself. Regaining instantly&#xD;
his ease of mauner,. he laughed good naturedly at himself, who&#xD;
had. managed; he said, 'thus far to make money to pay my&#xD;
board and store accounts, and not, I think, anything over. I&#xD;
do not, however, despair to do better after a while;' he added,_&#xD;
looking composedly upon Mr. Sandidge. ,&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge being thus appealed to, and looking as if he&#xD;
felt that that was a subject of which he ought to know some-&#xD;
thing, answered that-there were some few lawyers in the circuit&#xD;
who were making a ,living. Law was a mighty hard thing to&#xD;
make a living at. He had been trying it twenty-five years&#xD;
&#xD;
and better, and ought to know how hard it was. There was&#xD;
no business that it was not easier 'to make money at than&#xD;
law. If he had his time to go over again he hardly 'thought&#xD;
he would undertake it. Indeed, he knew he would not if' he&#xD;
knew what a young man had to go through with the first five&#xD;
or six years. Now, Mr. Sandidge had commenced the prac-&#xD;
tice of the law without a dollar, and with not even a good&#xD;
suit of clothes.. But he economized. He borrowed money at&#xD;
eight per cent. and shavedyjaper at sixteen and twenty. lie&#xD;
went to every Justices' ourt in the county ; learned the&#xD;
name of every manin it, got acquainted with every man's busi-&#xD;
ness, hunted up and set a'going litigation, until here he was in&#xD;
the possession of at least forty thousand dollars. And though&#xD;
many a man would have shrunk from what Mr. Sandidge had&#xD;
to go through with, yet, Mr. Sandidge told a story when he&#xD;
said what he did. lie would have gone through with it a&#xD;
thousand times over. For next to the money which he had&#xD;
made by the law, he loved the springs which it gave opportu-&#xD;
nities to make into the secrets of his neighbors, their silent&#xD;
struggles with sufferings and embarrassments, and he loved yet&#xD;
more the influence which the knowledge thus acquired enabled&#xD;
him to exert over them. But it was not his wont to encourage&#xD;
young, lawyers. Nobody encouraged him,,he reflected, and&#xD;
let them encourage 'themselves.&#xD;
'Yes,' he said, 'law is a hard thing to get on with. There's a&#xD;
power of books to read, which requires a power of money to&#xD;
buy; and there are so many contrary decisions on the same pints,&#xD;
and the practice and the pleadings are so hard to -learn, and&#xD;
then a man, a young man, has so often got to speak before the&#xD;
Court, where everybody is watching him, and when he don't&#xD;
know sometimes what tQ say, when a pint is made he did'nt ex-&#xD;
.: pect, and aint prepared to meet, and he gets embarrassed, and&#xD;
sometimes even has to- give up the case, and be non-suited.&#xD;
These things, as I said, and a heap of others I might mention,&#xD;
makes law a hard business to follow. But some  en' do, by&#xD;
hard labor, make living by it, by being economical. They&#xD;
say in Alabama, and down in South-western Georgia, it is&#xD;
easier to get along with it, and that some men even make for-&#xD;
tunes. There is more litigation there, and not so much compe-&#xD;
tition. But,' he ended, smiling quite, encouragingly, 'it may&#xD;
be worth while to try it even here. The profession is pretty&#xD;
well stocked to be surebut the more the. merrier, you know;'&#xD;

&#xD;
andjhe smiled almost audibly, and with such satisfaction at this&#xD;
attempt at pleasantry, that Mr. Mobley laughed at it heartily&#xD;
and said:.&#xD;
'And Saudidge, you know it is some consolation to a fellow who is&#xD;
getting along slowly to know that there are others who are at no&#xD;
faster pace than. himself ; fo'r appropos of your proverb is the one&#xD;
that misery loves company.'&#xD;
'Just so,' answered Mr.'Sandidge, and at this moment Mr. Parkin-&#xD;
son returned, and the two took their leave.&#xD;
When they were on their way home, Mr. Parkinson asked Over-&#xD;
ton how he liked the specimens is he termed his new acquaintances.&#xD;
The latter answered that he. was much pleased with the young&#xD;
man.&#xD;
And you are not very much pleased with Sandidge, I suppose?&#xD;
'Why, no, I cannot, say 'that I am  greatly prepossessed in his&#xD;
favor ; and I guess he returns the compliment, as he discourages my&#xD;
notion to practice law.'&#xD;
'He does, does he?' said. Mr. Parkinson, laughing. 'I knew  he&#xD;
would ; and though I am much of his opinion in regard to any&#xD;
young man who can do anything else, yet I must say that his exam-&#xD;
ple is encouraging. Hp very wll illustrates how a man of little&#xD;
talent, and less education, can grow rich and even attain to some&#xD;
eminence at the bar. Sandidge is certainly a queer genius. Twen-&#xD;
five years ago everybody laughed at him;--the Judge, the lawyers,&#xD;
the juries, and the people. But Sandidge laughed too in his way,&#xD;
and worked every, day and night'sand somehow he got into prac-&#xD;
tice. The Judge and lawyers came at last to respect him, the&#xD;
sheriffs to fear'hiin,,aid the people to be in awe of him, until now&#xD;
he has made a fortune, has more influence with the present Judge,&#xD;
and is, more successful before juries than any lawyer in the circuit.&#xD;
1,knew he would attempt to discourage you. He always does. I&#xD;
doubtif it is because he has notfeeling, but because it gratifies his&#xD;
vanity to exaggerate those obstacles which he had to overcome, and.&#xD;
which.nobody thought he would. And Sandidge, though he looks&#xD;
likc a fool; is really a, pretty good lawyer. There are men infinitely&#xD;
his superiors, but he is untiringly industrious. lie prepares his cases&#xD;
so thoroughly, and hangs.to them so doggedly, and studies the peo-&#xD;
ple so constantly, that hb is, I repeat it, the most successful prac-&#xD;
titioner I know, lie loves the law; he glories in "it, and  knows&#xD;
nothing outside of it.'&#xD;
'But Mr. Mobley ; heis certainly a man of real talent and educa-&#xD;
tion.. Ishe not likely.to succeed'?'&#xD;
'Mobley has very superior talent and a most finished education.&#xD;
He was educated by an uncle who died in the first year of his col-&#xD;
legiate life, leaving in the hands of his executors money to enable&#xD;
&#xD;
him to complete his course, and enter his profession. His parents&#xD;
both died when he was a child: But Mobley shines everywhere ex-&#xD;
cept in the Coirt room. There .he does not yet seem to be quite at&#xD;
home. I have heard him speak once or twice, and .h ertainly&#xD;
speaks well. But Sandidge worries him sowith the starting-of un-&#xD;
expected issues that he is often put to his wit's end. If he could&#xD;
live without the practice, I am inclined to think that, notwithstand-&#xD;
ing his prT Ie,.he would abandon it. He' will' succeed though after&#xD;
a while, I doubt not, if he will persevere. He is a fellow of fine&#xD;
wit, and gores Sandidge badly sometimes when he can reach him,&#xD;
which is not often the case, with' this weapon. But Sandidge only&#xD;
smiles, and almost always givns things a turn which is sure to give&#xD;
him the best of it at last.'    .i                    t&#xD;
'Deyou usually have much business in the Courts?'&#xD;
'And if so, which of'these men do I employ to attend to it, you&#xD;
would ask. Well,' continued Mr. Parkinson, somewhat ajologeti-&#xD;
cally, 'what little I ha. e do in that way, I usually give to Sandidge.&#xD;
,;I have known him a long time, and he has always seemed to act an&#xD;
, honest' part towards me. Besides, a man, you know, does not&#xD;
usually like to change the channel of his business.'&#xD;
Mr, Povkinson did not have the heart, after what he had said of&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge's influence with the presiding Judge, to give that as&#xD;
t another reason for retaining him.&#xD;
The young man said nothing ; but'he thought with himself that&#xD;
hard as it was on a poor fellow like Mobley, it was natural. And&#xD;
is it the less hard because it is natural that the world will delay t&#xD;
givehelp to a 'man in any business of life until, by long toiling and&#xD;
striving alone, he has at last reached a point where lie can live&#xD;
without it? Yet, such is the way of life. You man with many&#xD;
cents, and many more friends, has there not been a time when&#xD;
nineteen  of every twenty of those    whom  you now    value&#xD;
Â° the most highly would have forborne to lend you a helping&#xD;

As a set-off to this professional eminence, he had rem fined as he&#xD;
had begun, poor in purse. Three ycars before this an election was&#xD;
beingi'eld for the office of judge of the Superior Court of that cir-&#xD;
cuit. Let us remember that at that time the judge ol the Superior&#xD;
Co rtwa-the only high judicial officer in the circuit. He was both&#xD;
judge and chancellor. His discretion was uncontrolled and uncon-&#xD;
trollA1e in all cases regarding the security, the property, and repu&#xD;
tation of citizens ; and even his construction of the Constitution of&#xD;
the State was unalterable by any human power,-Three years be-&#xD;
fore, politics had taken one of its tnrns, and the party to which the&#xD;
fourth-rate lawyer of twenty-five year's practice belonged, unexpct-&#xD;
edly found itself with a small majority in the legislature. The i-&#xD;
cunbent of the Bench, being a member of the minority, was ef course&#xD;
to share its fate and retire from office. There were two prominent can-&#xD;
didates from the party in power ; one .a retired member of Congress&#xD;
who was finding it difficult to recover the practice which he had&#xD;
given up fifteen years before, and the other a man of ten years con-&#xD;

nection with the profession, of very promising talents, and of a good&#xD;
property, who sought the office for the eclat, and the powerwhich it&#xD;
would confer upon him. Several ballots had been mad without an&#xD;
election. Mr. Elam Sandidge, for certain reasons of his own, had&#xD;
consented to represent his county in the Senate, and was one of the&#xD;
party in minority.A more amused man    r it was  seldom any one's&#xD;
privilege to see than was h~ when on foie repeated counting oto&#xD;
the votes the presiding officer announced that there had been no&#xD;
election. He looked to this and to that one on either side of the&#xD;
house, and went about whispering to some and winking at others.&#xD;
'What is that dirty old rascal doing on our side of the aisle?' in-&#xD;
quired a majority member of his neighbor.&#xD;
I can't tell ; but some rascality brings him here, you may sweat&#xD;
to that.'&#xD;
While the votes were- being counted out for the fifth time M&#xD;
Sandidge walked quickly over to that side. A dozen anxious, piti-.&#xD;
ful looking members gathered around him.'p&#xD;
'Put him up nezt! put him up next time!' he said, and walked back&#xD;
again, taking in with a sweeping wine the whole of his own party.&#xD;
When the result was announced, anti directions given to prepare for&#xD;
another balloting, 'Mr. President, Mr. residnt,' scr   aieoio&#xD;
hrom the majority side, 'I announce the name of Littleberry W. Mike&#xD;

by roars of laughter from the minority and by hisses, and cries of&#xD;
'who is he . from the other. Immediately, however, the leaders of&#xD;
both were busy ,a. bees. Threats and criminations were heard&#xD;
among the friends of the two prominent candidates; then entreaties&#xD;
from both to the opposition. 'Take him down, for heavens sake.'&#xD;
'It is a shame by blood.' 'Don't put him on us, if you please.' 'Any&#xD;

When a man of inferior parts is raised to an office ofg rtat author-&#xD;

tions, to tert tk t' hority, as far as is compatible'-with safety, in&#xD;
enforcing'a -regar  which those parts have been inadequate to se-&#xD;
cure. Cowardly as thissis, it is not more injurious to truth, and jus-&#xD;
tice, and reason thaf when such a man is led by such an elevationY&#xD;
to look upon himself  s havii been, heretofore depreciated, and to&#xD;
consider the elevation, whatever were t1 circumstances which af-&#xD;
fected it, as the decree of infinite justice in his favor, determining at&#xD;
last to give merit its just, reward. Sometimes he is in one, and some-&#xD;
times in the other of these two states alternately ; never being able&#xD;
to determine exactly whether he ought to occupy his position or&#xD;
not, but ever attempting to resolve the doubt by such a vigorous&#xD;
exercise of authority as viil at least foreclose all doubts in the minds&#xD;
of others as to his actual possession of it.  Of such a character was&#xD;
the newly elected judge. He had long had his heart set upon the&#xD;
bench. He looked up to it as a mighty emifience-mighty enough&#xD;
to satisfy the most eager ambition. Yet his desires were not ac-&#xD;
tuated wholly by ambition. He wanted the salary. He needed it.&#xD;
He was poor and had a family ;'and pitiful as the salary was, it was&#xD;
twice as much as he made by his practice. Ashamed as he was to&#xD;
know how the people'regarded the notion of his-being Judge of the&#xD;
Superior Court, he never, even for one moment, gave up his desire&#xD;
to become so, but kept himself always, yet in a quiet way, in candi-&#xD;
dacy fort. And though to the leading members of the bar he had&#xD;
never presumed to speak of the matter, knowing that he would be&#xD;
laughed at if he did, they yet well knew what his thoughts and&#xD;
his hopes were. Nor had he publicly announced his candidacy at&#xD;
the meeting of the Legislature. He knew well that his only chance&#xD;
of election depended upon the fact, whether true or false, it made no&#xD;
material difference with him, that he was considered the weakest and&#xD;
shabbipt of the candidates of his party. While the prominent ones&#xD;
of these were making interest with the leaders of.the party in the&#xD;
Legislature, he had quietly, and in a way known only to himself and&#xD;
them, and vdry probably to Mr. Sandidge, obtained the promise of&#xD;
assistance from a -few unknown members who should be able, by&#xD;
scattering their votes under the direction of him and Mr. Sandidge,&#xD;
to defeat te election f anmy one until a, suitable opportunity should&#xD;
occur for the name to lbe presented. We have seen with what re.&#xD;
sult this was done.&#xD;
With the recollection of all' the 'circumstances, Judge Mike&#xD;
thanked two objects for his elevation : first, his own lucky genius,&#xD;
and secondly, Mr. Sandidge. He was, doubtless, quite inclined to&#xD;
indulge in kindly and grateful feeling towards the latter from habit ;&#xD;
for he was under a pecuniary indebtedness' to him of several hun-&#xD;

or four years before, had been kind enough to 'lift,' to have trans'&#xD;

'sideration of sixteen, which he called a living'per century of into-&#xD;

when at every renewal of the note for the extra interest, he solemn.&#xD;
]y avowed his need of the money, and of his subru ssi n to go with&#xD;
out, it for no earthly reason than to oblige his friends ! On that&#xD;
friend's accession to the Bench, when first they were alone together,&#xD;
he took the last note of renewal from his pocket book, and handed&#xD;
It to him without saying a word.' The judge, appearing surprised,&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge, with skiing solemnity, protested that he never could&#xD;
exact usurious interest from a Judge of the superior Court of the&#xD;
State of Georgia. He hoped he had too much respect for the digni.&#xD;
ty of the office to do any such'thing as that. The judge, after foo.&#xD;
ble remonstration, took the note, looked at it, signed,' and tearing it&#xD;
slowly to pieces, felt already one of those palpitating and almost&#xD;
painful joys which only men in office have. It vvas a small malters&#xD;

'That's what I tell him.'&#xD;

Not the first thing. That's\wbat I tell 'em.'&#xD;
'They think:that because such a pint has been decided such a.&#xD;

they are forever and eteaally talking about settling the law, set-&#xD;
tling the law-like it was, Sandidge-.just like it was so much cof-&#xD;
fee.'&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge spat all over himself, wiped his mouth with his hand,&#xD;
and came very near laughing outright.&#xD;
'And I would like to know how, in the name of common sense,&#xD;
it ever could get settled. There aint any thing to settle it by.&#xD;
That's the pint ;' there aint any thing to settle it by.' He looked&#xD;
enquiringly at 1.i 1. Sandidge, and seemed to wish that gentleman to&#xD;
tell what there was to settle it by if he knew of any such thing.&#xD;
The latter shook his head.&#xD;
'No sir ! there aint nothing to settle it by - and when Mobley is&#xD;
talking about what Lord Mansfield said, and what Lord Hardwick&#xD;
said, or any of them okd lords and judges, it's on the end of my'&#xD;
tongue to stop him, and tell him that they are all dead, and conse-&#xD;
quently can't know any thing about the case at bar. And, San-&#xD;
didge, it always struck me as very curious that the laws of Eng-&#xD;
land should be the laws of Georgia,''&#xD;
It was a remarkable coincidence that that idea had over and&#xD;
over again struck Mr. Sandidge. He, however, hinted, that in&#xD;
some cases, (and those were=cases in his opinion when the authority&#xD;
happened to be on his own side,)- where the English law was very&#xD;
'plain and directly in point, and it ought to be followed.'&#xD;
'Certainly, certainly, in such cases ; and I do follow it ; but I&#xD;
am the judge of that myself.'&#xD;

didge almost frowned in. the effort of elaborating this reductio ad.&#xD;
absurdum.&#xD;
'Absurd-so I think; and Mobley and such as he may study their eyes out&#xD;
for me. When they bring up law that I think is right, I shall sustain them;&#xD;
when I don't think so I shall overrule them. They may get their Supreme&#xD;
Court if they can. It aint going to be in my day, thank God. If it was, I&#xD;
just know that I couldn't and wouldn't stand it. Before I would havb an.&#xD;
overseer over me, and I judge of the Superior Court, and have to be eternally&#xD;
looking into old books to find out what them old English lords and judges&#xD;
said a hundred years ago, when the country wasn't like this, nor the people&#xD;
neither--why Sandidge you know I havn't got the books, and couldn't afford&#xD;
to buy them-I say before I would be put to all the trouble and expense of&#xD;
reading law and nothing else, and then have my decisions brought back on me,&#xD;
and treated like I was-like I was in fact a nigger-I would die first.'&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge smiled approvingly.&#xD;
'Why; who would respect me?'&#xD;
'Nobody.'&#xD;
'How could I enforce the authority of tje Court?'&#xD;
'couldn't- be done.'&#xD;
If I put a fellow in jail just like as not they would take him out.'&#xD;

'If I refused to grant a new trial, knowing that I am against then, they&#xD;
would send a paper ordering me to grant it. Don't you see they would&#xD;
knowing I am against 'em?'&#xD;
'Plain as day. Send a'paper ordering the Judge of the Superior Court!'&#xD;
I tell you, Sandidge,. before I would stand it, I would die first. In fact, I&#xD;
would RESIGN I!'&#xD;
This was capping the climax. Dying would be a poor and very inade-&#xD;
quate resentment. lie would go beyond that. He would voluntarily and&#xD;
disgustedly let go his hold upon power. The consequences might be what&#xD;
they pleased, he would resign. 'I tell you, Satididge,' he repeated once more,&#xD;
with fearful emphasis, 'I should RESIGN!!'&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge, although purposing to appear alarmed, smiled notwith-&#xD;
standing ; and perhaps the more because he thought such a deplorable event&#xD;
not very likely to come to pass; and perhaps yet more, because it instantly&#xD;
occurred to him that if it ever should, he would console himself in themnidst&#xD;

'And'what' will you leading lawyers do when young men, smart young men,&#xD;

organization of such .a tribunal, rather than of his own early decease,, which&#xD;
gave the gratified and complacent expression to that smiling countenance.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.             *&#xD;
Overton attended the Court, and obtained, by the assistance of Mr. Mobley,&#xD;
seat within the bar. He had been introduced to several lawyers from dif-&#xD;
ferent counties within the circuit, and toythe jtidge. On his introduction to&#xD;
the latter, he remarked a certain ungainly attempt at a congratulation on his&#xD;
expected accession to the profession,' which was authing else but cordial.&#xD;
Mobley had spoken of him to the other lawyers, ih the judge's hearing, as a&#xD;
young man of education and genius, when Mr. Sandidgerwho was sitting by&#xD;
him at the time, whispered that that was the sort'of'men who were always&#xD;
talking about a Supreme Court. -After this, His 'Honor took no further no-&#xD;
tice of him. During the week, he noticed what was new to him how much&#xD;
of an art it was to conciliate and to control' the Court. It was evident that&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge was the favorite. Every body knew that. Mr. Sandidge him.&#xD;
self, who had long foreseen and fore-ordained it. Of all positions in a free&#xD;
government, where favoritism is worth having,- it was that of'a favorite cir-&#xD;
cult judge of Georgia in the old times. When the fortunes of men, their sccu-&#xD;
rity, and sometimes even the~it lives were dependant upon the will of an indi.&#xD;
vidual, and that individual' menable to no earthly tribunal for whatever&#xD;
errors ,he might commit, or even for his wickedness, except upon principles&#xD;
the most vagih and uncertain, it was an art ranking as high as the science of,&#xD;
the law itself, and attainable by greater cost and sacrifice, to obtain an easy&#xD;
and successful access to the ear of that most important depositary of&#xD;
rower. They were the fortunate accidents of our ;mcient judiciary system,&#xD;
that there was a goodly number of virtuous and talented men upon the bench ;&#xD;
for neither virtue nor any very considerable amount of talent were essential&#xD;
qualifications. If the occupant for the time hilg possessed\ them, very well-&#xD;
Rf not, then not so well, yet well enough.&#xD;
The present occupant, we have seen, had no uncommon talents. In vir.-&#xD;
tue, he was neither good nor bad. At least, he was incapable of bribery. If&#xD;
bawas below the capacity to feel or to understand a noble impulse, he was&#xD;

,above that of perpetrating an act of plain dishonesty. In talent and in  ir.&#xD;
tue, he might be said to have occupied a-middle state between high and low,&#xD;
but tending downwards. Fortunately for some, unfortunately for others, he&#xD;
was not'brave. Now, of all official personages, cowards are the most trouble-&#xD;
some and oppressive. Tliy are troublesome to those of whom they are&#xD;
afraid, and oppressive to those who are afraid of them; troublesome to the&#xD;
former by inflicting petty annoyances, in the use of small advantages, and&#xD;
the punishment of-unimportant lapses in :cmembrances. and in resentment of&#xD;
the pain they feel on account of such persons ; oppressive to the latter in or-&#xD;
der to preserve the equilibrium between the feeling and the excitement of fear.&#xD;
This quality is not peculiar to official nor even t6 human cowards. Instance&#xD;
canine. I once saw in the city of Milledgeville, one cur badly bitten and con-&#xD;
quered in single combat with     c tr. Immediately afterwards, as with his&#xD;
tale shrunk between his hind legs, he iwas making for home with what speed&#xD;
be could employ, he spied one of those dogs commonly denominated amongst&#xD;
us as flee, whereupon his tail at once came out to its natural suspension; ho&#xD;
rushed upon the little animal, and without any known justifiable cause, and&#xD;
even without any previous acquaintance with him, caught him by the throat&#xD;
and shook him until he was beaten off with rods. After ho had gotten out of&#xD;
the reach of these, he went on his way leisurely, apparently satisfied that b&#xD;
was again even with the w6rld.&#xD;
Mr. Sandidgo was the favorite. The judge liked him not only for past fa-&#xD;
vors of the kind we knew of, but for another reason. He thought Mr. San-&#xD;
didge a man like himself and about his quality; and, therefore, he liked to&#xD;
do honor to himself as it were in honoring his image. Mr. Sandidge made no&#xD;
great pretension to a knowledge of books, and he thanked him for that. lie&#xD;
never even hinted about a Supreme Court, but seemed to be, as in fact he&#xD;
was, satisfied with the tray of the present administration of justice. Such&#xD;
being the relations between them, Mr. Sandidge was lucky in gettingrulings&#xD;
in his favor. He was in fact a much better lawyer than the judge, and&#xD;
shrewod enough to beguile him of many a wrong decision, even had he been&#xD;
different to him.&#xD;
But, notwithstanding this favoritism, there were two or three lawyers of&#xD;
real ability who, in spite of their contempt of him and his dislike of them, ex-&#xD;
ceised over him that 'influence which a strong and bold intellect will always&#xD;
exert over a weak and timid one. Above flattering him, they often, and even&#xD;
against Mr. Sandidge, obtained rulings of doubtful right, when ho was un-&#xD;
able, out of his dread oftheir unconcealed contempt, to resist them. But to&#xD;
compensate Mr. Sandidge for such as 'this, and-to preserve his own regard for&#xD;

himself, he eagerly sought for opportunities to help himin taking advantage&#xD;
of oversights in pleadings and in proof ; oversights which Mr. Sandidge him-&#xD;
self never committed. The latter was, in addition, graciously allowedto dom-&#xD;
ineer to, any extent over the younger lawyers. They stood in great awe of the&#xD;
:bench. They could neither cajole nor brow-beat. Even a respectful remon-&#xD;
strance 'from them was usually  'ollowed by a fine, ora threat tf it. They,&#xD;
'therefore, timidly went about their business in the Court, hoping for the com-&#xD;
ug of the day when they might become brow-beaters of Sandidges.&#xD;
Like most small-minded men who go upon the bench, this judge set him-&#xD;
=self up for a great reformer of abuses.. He was a terror to evil doers ; espe-&#xD;
cially to those who did it on a small scale. Whenever he got a chancehe was&#xD;
wont to stiok the law on to thern (to use his own phrase) up to the very hilt.&#xD;
There were two vices in particular which he hated cordially. They were&#xD;
fighting and usury. Whenever he could get a blow at either of these, he&#xD;
struck it with all his official might. Mr. Sandidge well knew his weakness&#xD;
on tie subject of usury, and managed so as to have no cases of his own, bu&#xD;
'confined his financial operations to shaving paper. And yet he was lucky&#xD;
enough to make more out of usurious transactions than he was accustomed&#xD;
to when he loaned out his own money. For nqw the pleading of usury had be-&#xD;
come common, and there was no lawyer, who could compare with him in fer-&#xD;
reting testimony to establish its proof.  .&#xD;
Of the younger lawyers. Mr. Mobley was an exception sofar as to the&#xD;
standing in any awe of the judge. He was usually ve'y much embarrassed-in&#xD;
the management of his cases, because ofhis apprehension of being cast by the&#xD;
starting of sbme unforeseen difficulty, as was often the case from the want of&#xD;
familiarity with precedents and forms. Here was Mr. Sandidge's forte. He&#xD;
understood pleading and the' rules of practice thoroughly, and it was his de-&#xD;
light to pick flaws in his adversary's papers, and drive him out of court. Mr.&#xD;
Mobley was afraid of hjm on these grounds, and well he might be ; but other-&#xD;
wise he was insensible to fear. The people were generally in great need of the&#xD;
court. Here was where he could domineer at his pleasure. They should feel&#xD;
his power. All absences, of witnesses and jurors, all noises in the court room&#xD;
and court yard, all misdemeanors of all sorts, met with ready and condign&#xD;
punishment: always, the more condign when their convictions came on shortly&#xD;
after a series of browheatings from those whom he could not frighten. One&#xD;
morning during the progress of a trialin whichhis patience had been sorely tried&#xD;
a man ini the crowd near the bar having a cold blew his nose-an action&#xD;
natural and necessary to the preservation of whatever amount of comfort is&#xD;
consistent with that ailmen4. The action in this instance was accompanied by&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
0x&#xD;
&#xD;
the usual loudnessa of sound produced by those who have uncommonly good&#xD;
lungs.&#xD;
'Mr. Sheriff bring that nose-blower within the bar.'&#xD;
The culprit was brought in.&#xD;
'Is this court a stable, sir, that you must bray in it like a jackass?'&#xD;
eg unhappy man answered the question respectfully and candidly in tho&#xD;
negative.&#xD;
What dobyou bray in it for then, sir?'&#xD;
.I didn't br-. I didn't know I was a brayim in it ,edge.    only blowed&#xD;
my nose, havin of a bad cold.'&#xD;
'What are yon doing here any way, sir ?.&#xD;
1 jest come to court, sir.'&#xD;
'Got any business here?'&#xD;
'No, sir.'&#xD;
'What did yo-u come for, then?'&#xD;
Why, I thought, edgeg, that everybody was liable to come to court.'&#xD;
'Liable, liable ! yes, and so are they liable to behave themselves ; and it'&#xD;
they don't, they are liablo to be fined.  WXhat is your name, sir ?'.&#xD;
'Allen Thigpen, sir.'&#xD;
'Thigpen, Thigpen ! I might have known that any body by that iamno&#xD;
could'nt tell a court room  from a stable. Mr. Thigpen you are fined in&#xD;
the sum of two dollars?&#xD;
Mr. Thigpen ran his hand into his pocket, And drawing out adirty buckskin&#xD;
purse, emptied it, and counting the pieces with a rueful face, walked up two&#xD;
or three of the steps,,and extending his hand to the edge. Dollar one-and-&#xD;
nine i the highth of what I could raise if I was going to be hung.'&#xD;
Now, whether from looking upwards at so -resplendent a luminary as the&#xD;
judge, or from the violence of his cold, we could not say ; but, as His honor&#xD;
was' gazing upon the extended band in ludicrous surprise and wrath Mr.&#xD;
Thigpen felt a sudden impulse to sneeze-an impulse which, whenever it&#xD;
comes, in court rooms or elsewhere, must be obeyed. Ie made herculean&#xD;
efforts to suppress it; but as is usual in such eases, its victory was but the&#xD;
more triumphant and violent. In his terror, and endeavoring to assure the&#xD;
judge that he was doing his best, he could not avert his eyes from vim.1 is&#xD;
face assumed the agonized contortions of a maniac; his great chest heaved like&#xD;
a niountain' in labor, and he uttered a shriek which, in any circumstances but&#xD;
those which showed that nothing serious or uncommon was the matter, would&#xD;
have filled all within a circle of two hundred yards diameter with consternation.&#xD;
In the violence of the paroxysm, thQ coin flew up from his hand as if they had&#xD;

bee  discharged from a catapult, and coming down, some of themfell upon&#xD;
thajudge's head and rolled into his lap. An instantaneous burst of laughter&#xD;
followed this explosion, which, however, was-as instantly hushed. No words&#xD;
can depict the expressions upon the faces of the two prominent actors. The&#xD;
judge had been, as it were lifted out of his chair, and there the two stood&#xD;
glaring upon each other, speechless. Each seemed to feel that this was no&#xD;
time for talking-that words were inadegqnate to do justice to the occasion.&#xD;
His Honor snatched up the docket with the evident intention of knocking Mr.&#xD;
'1 higpen down, whether in self-defence, or in vindication of the outraged dig-&#xD;
nity of the court, it was impossible to tell. Mr. Thigpen looked at it beseech-&#xD;
iagly--as much as to say, knock me down with, it and welcome, but please&#xD;
don't hang me. There they stood for a quarter of a minute - then the&#xD;
judge, feeling doubtless that neither the penal code nor the court's discretion&#xD;
were adequate to punish the outrage as it deserved, said almost in a whisper,&#xD;
as the offender stood with his face untorted and unwiped:&#xD;
'For God's sake be off from here, you cussed fool, and never let me see you&#xD;
again in this world.'&#xD;
11e made no unnecessary delay. When he had gotten fairly without hear-&#xD;
ing of the court, a crowd which had followed him were roaring around him&#xD;
with laughter.'&#xD;
'How did you feel, Allen?' asked one.&#xD;
'Feel! I did'nt have no feelins. They was all scared out o' me.'&#xD;
'But what 'did you carry him the money for?'&#xD;
Carry him the money?   Wasn't that right?  He found me.'&#xD;
They whooped.&#xD;
'I thought the money was his'n. I 'lowed that was the way he got hia&#xD;
livin.'&#xD;
'Gentlemen '!" he resumed, when the crowd had recovered from the effect of&#xD;
this last remark, 'gentlemen, there's two things in this country that 'm agin.&#xD;
They are schools and court rooms. When I were standing thar jist now, if&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Strain against Rickles!'&#xD;
It was now Friday morning. The Judge was weary with the session, and&#xD;
fretful from repeated wranglings with several leading attorneys. These had&#xD;
all gone, the important cases having been tried or continued. The Court had&#xD;
announced its determination to adjourn that afternoon, whether the docket&#xD;
should be finished or not. It had not seen its family in two weeks, and it&#xD;
must and would see its family by to-morrow night. Juries and by-stan4er.&#xD;
were quiet as mice. Mr. Sandidge was in the enjoyment of mild happiness,&#xD;
not only from the remembrance of having had a good run of luck 'during the&#xD;
week, but because the Judge was now in a hurry, and the case of Stra&#xD;
against Rickles was yet untried. He wished it continued, for he was of coun-&#xD;
sel for defendant, and their plea was doubtful.&#xD;
'Strain vs. Rickles,' announced the Court, rapidly and fretfully, with pen in&#xD;
hand, as if to hint that it was expected to follow the fate of the half-dozen&#xD;
preceding cases, and be disposed of summarily.&#xD;
'Ready for the plaintiff,' announced Mr. Mobley.&#xD;
The Judge dropped his pen,leaned back in his chair, and cast a throatontng&#xD;
look at the counsel. Mr. Sandidge merely remarked that that was a case iin&#xD;
which some pints of law were involved, and as the Court was anxious to ad"&#xD;
journ and to go home and see its family, he suggested that if the counsel was&#xD;
willing/it might be Continued generally. Mr. Mobley objecting to this dispo..&#xD;
sition, he, after having a witness called, and receiving no answer, proceeded to&#xD;
make a showing for a continuance by the defendant. This was the absence of&#xD;
a witness who, as he had been informed, had said that he knew all about the&#xD;
case from beginning to end. It was in vain that Mr. Mobley urged the in-&#xD;
sufficiency of the showing for its indefiniteness, and the right of the opposing&#xD;
counsel to send for the witness who lived in the village, and who, as his client&#xD;
informed him, was then on the street and within hearing of the sheriff's call.&#xD;
He mentioned this fact and that his client had just passed him in the street&#xD;
and heard hin say when he was called, 'It is Sandidge. I know what he&#xD;
wants ; he don't. want me.'&#xD;
'If the counsel or the court desires the presence of the witness, he can be&#xD;
procured in less than five minutes by sending the sheriff for him. Do I &#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6904-00000031"/>&#xD;
T~WMOROil TATE.&#xD;
derstand that this court will continue a case and delay' the rights of creditors&#xD;
when it is assured that a witness who refuses to attend its summons is within&#xD;
hearing of its officer's call-a witness whose acquaintance with the facts there&#xD;
is only a heresay and that the most indefinite-a witness who, to appearances,&#xD;
is absent by the procurement, if not of the party at least of his counsel?'&#xD;
The Judge hesitated. Mr. Sandidge seeing the effect upon both of them of&#xD;
an exposure of, what was the fact, his instructions to the witness, not to obey&#xD;
the call, withdrew his motion.&#xD;
'I do this, may it please your Honor, not from anything my brother Mobley&#xD;
has said in argument, or for his insinuations about procurements and such&#xD;
like.' The showing is a sufficient one ; but I'll waive it-I'll waive it, sir, and&#xD;
I think I'm prepared-I say, I think I'm prepared (noticing the judge's dis-&#xD;
satisfaction at the direction the matter was taking,) to end this matter very&#xD;
summarily. The defendant is ready.'              .&#xD;
A jury was impannelled, and Mr. Mobley proceeded with the case. It was&#xD;
a simple action upon a promissory note given, by defendant to plaintiff, who&#xD;
was a merchant from Augusta. Ile read the declaration, exhibited the note&#xD;
and closed.&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge rose, and remarking tJiat this was a case which he apprehended&#xD;
would not long occupy the time of the court and the time of the county, an-&#xD;
nounced to Mr. Mobley, t1iat upon consulting his client, he had just ascer-&#xD;
tained that the consideration of the note sued on was usurious, and that his&#xD;
conclusion-being to rely on that defense solely, he should have to ask time of&#xD;
the court in order to mak out the plea, unless counsel would agree to consider&#xD;
it in already.&#xD;
Mr. Mobley, turning to his client, who assured him that it was not true,&#xD;
allowed Mr. Sandidge, to proceed.&#xD;
A witness, the same who had been called, and whom Mr. Sandidge private-&#xD;
ly' sent for, went to the stand. After the iuual preliminary that he did not&#xD;
particularly charge his mind with what he leard and saw, not expecting to&#xD;
be called on, he did remember that the parties said something about tie note&#xD;
being in rend wal of accounts, some of which plaintiff himself had against de-&#xD;
fendant, and others of which he had traded to him; that he heard plaintiff tell&#xD;
defendant that if he would give hi note for them, adding in the interest, he&#xD;
would indulge him a year on its payment ; that the defendant having agreed&#xD;
to the proposition, gave his note, payable at twelve months. In answer to a&#xD;
question from Mr. Mobley whether anything was said about extra interest, he&#xD;
did not recollect as to that: didn't particularly 'charge his mind, not Ax-&#xD;
pecting to be called on. Mr. Saudidge offered in evidence the accounts with&#xD;

legal interest computed in, acknowledging payment by note and bearing even&#xD;
date with it. Then casting a triumphant smile at every body, he sat iown.&#xD;
Mr. Mobloy looked at the judge with an expression which seene(l to say&#xD;
'Surely, no fool,,not even you, would admit such testimony.' The judge looked&#xD;
at him, and his countenance seemed to . ask, 'What do you say to. that, Mr.&#xD;
Mobley?' Mr. Mobley avowed his belief that ih all judicial history, a thing&#xD;
so absurd had never l)cfore been proposed, and he move that the whole evi-&#xD;
dence be excluded, and he . bealhowed to take a verdict. Being called on for&#xD;
his reasons: 'Because,' said he, contemptuously, 'it does iot, support the plea.&#xD;
You have pleaded usury, and you have proved that the contract is not&#xD;
usurious.&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge said, that lie might be mistaken ; that he said he might he&#xD;
mistaken, but that he had never heard-he had now been practicing law&#xD;
twenty-five years and better-but that to the best of his recollection, he had&#xD;
never seen nor heard of a case where interest wo , elected, or could be collect-&#xD;
ed on open accounts, on accounts that were not li1uidated.&#xD;
'Who gainsays that?' Mr. Mobley interposed.&#xD;
'The counsel will please allow me to l)occd, kuiwitig as he does, his r ight&#xD;
to reply. I said, may it please your Honor, that in my reoollection, in a&#xD;
practice now of twenty-live years and better, I had never seen nor heard of a&#xD;
case where interest vias collected or could he collected on open accounts-on&#xD;
accounts that were not liquidated. That thing is for the first time in my&#xD;
practice; sought to be enforced upon a court and upon a country. The plain-&#xD;
tiff in this case-and these Angusty merchants--'&#xD;
'Go on to the jury,' ordered the judge.&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge bowel and turned to the jury.&#xD;
'These Augusty n   hats, gentlemen of the jury,' 'easily resuming the&#xD;
thread of his argumen t, 'these Augusty merchants, as a general thing, always&#xD;
krow what they are a bout. I say always-not a single exception ;' and he&#xD;
bestowed on the plain iff a look fully significant of his admission that he was&#xD;
entitled to his share o Ihe encomium pronounced upon the class of which he&#xD;
was an individual. 'These Augusty merchants know more in an hour than we&#xD;
plain country people do in a week. And it is reasonable to suppose that they&#xD;
do ; and 'tis because they are Augusty merchants ; for what chance have we&#xD;
here in the country got to know as much as they know? We don't see the&#xD;
steam boats, and the power of the wagons, and the thousands of cotton bags&#xD;
and the fine brick ware houses, and the hardware stores and the other stores that&#xD;
always keep full of one particular kind of goods. If Tommy Riekles was to go to&#xD;
Augusty, and was to want to buy a dog-knife for his little boy, he would just as apt&#xD;

to goto a store which bad nothing in it but calico and dry goods, and fuller of them&#xD;
than all the stores in this town ; an I when they laughed and told him they&#xD;
were just out of that article, he might go to a hat store, and then into a shoe&#xD;
store, and then into a candy store-into a store where the shelves was literally&#xD;
blinded with Jars of candy, and nothing but candy; and so it might be an hour&#xD;
before he got to a hardware store and found a dog knife for his little boy, and&#xD;
fjien ten to one, he couldn't find his way back to his wagon. I say we don't&#xD;
know any thing to compare with these Augusty merchants. Bat still there are&#xD;
someafew things that we do know if we do live here in the country where there&#xD;
paint any steam boats, and hat stores, and candy stores, and hardware stores;&#xD;
and one.of them is that you ce-ant collect interest on open accounts.'&#xD;
That settled it Mr. Sandidge seemed to think ; and several of the jury,&#xD;
though evidently not yet very clear, inclined t think so too.&#xD;
'We all know thl,' continued 'Mr. Sandidge--'that is, all except Tommy&#xD;
R ickles.' (G . c daughter , the jury seeing the matter a little. mere ciasriy&#xD;
;specially as Tpmmy looked so innocent and pitiful.)&#xD;
'And, geotlenen, Tommy knowed it too, if he had thought about it, and&#xD;
had'nt been with a Augusty merchant ; Ond had'nt been thinking of the steam.;&#xD;
boats, and the power of the wagons, and the hat stores, and the shoe stores, and&#xD;
the hardware storess, and got his senses all confused up together.' (Continued&#xD;
laughter, a majority of the ju ry being fully satisfied.)&#xD;
The judge waxing stern at the disorder, Mr. Sandidge had to moderate his&#xD;
humor, and concluded by arguing heatedly and seriously as he could, and even&#xD;
womeWhat'pathetically that interest not being collectible on open accounts, this&#xD;
plain principle vitiated the whole transaction and made it usurious . With&#xD;
another avowal of hip desire not to take up the time of the court and the time&#xD;
of the country by arguing so plain case, he sat down, bs countenaue ex.&#xD;
pressing both a virtuous indignation at a great wrong which was attempted,&#xD;
and a proud satisfaction that it could not he done over his shoulders&#xD;
Mr. Mobley felt that, with the prejudices of the judge against himself and&#xD;
especially against usiry, and the cunning Mr. Sandidge, he was in great danger&#xD;
of losing his case. He spoke with great-e;ergy on the absurdity of the defend.&#xD;
ant's plea. In the midst of his argument, 'Mr. Sandidge asked him for his au-&#xD;
thorities. This was done to embarrass him and throw him off his guard, as he&#xD;
would have had to admit that there was no authority in point ; but he had&#xD;
now gotten too high to be reached by M:. Sandidge.&#xD;
Â¢ am asked,' he said, 'for the production of authority that the giving of a.&#xD;

nent enough to be, what it esnecIally behooves every lawyer to be, a conser vko'&#xD;
ofpublio tranquility and private integrity-one who, with all his boasted contempt&#xD;
of legal precedents, and his real ignorance of them, yet knows full well thit in&#xD;
no court of justice, even the most insignificant wa this question, or any other&#xD;
one so absurd as this, ever raised; and whose only reason for raising it at this&#xD;
time, was his knowledge of the existence of dishonest habits and unreasonable&#xD;
prejudices which, as a leading citizen he ought to be one of the last to oucoUT&#xD;
age. Violent as the presumption often i , nd far from the very semblance ot&#xD;
truth, it is, nevertheless, a presumption that judges know the laws; and  t&#xD;
ought to be the habit of attorneys and solictors, especially those of experience&#xD;
and influence, to reftairi from  maisieg questions, a moment's entertainment of&#xD;
which by any court is suficient to depriv? it of the respect of all men. I3et&#xD;
it has remained for this day to witne' hit the highest court in one of the&#xD;
sovereign States of this Confederacy, shall be insultd ilA its dignity and majesty&#xD;
by a course of conduct which seems to have been designedly pursued in order&#xD;
to test the vanity of that court's presiding ollicer. Assuredly to no other min d&#xD;
than to that of the counsel had it b.en possible to fail to occur, that an insig.&#xD;
nificant advantage in a suit at law was scarcely worth the having when it was&#xD;
to be gained in a way which, to say nothing of its influence upon its client,&#xD;
would establish either the stultification of the court, or (and he looked fixedly&#xD;
and fearlessly into the judge's face,) raise the suspicion of a yet greater in&#xD;
firmity. Even if he should consider himself as so great a friend to the court'&#xD;
whether from past favors 'or present adulation, or from any other cause, as to&#xD;
think himself entitled to the exalted privilege of being its favorite, one would&#xD;
have suppcs d that, if for no other reason, at least from motives of prudence&#xD;
and decency, he would have confined his conduct within that sphere whero&#xD;
there would have been left at least a doubt as to what judgment that conduct&#xD;
ought to receive. It is a duty which we owe even to our private friends, not&#xD;
to demand a service of which there can be found no reason but friendship to&#xD;
justify the rendering, while'every other reason but friendship would demand its&#xD;
refusal. There are some services which  ho ardor of friendship is adequate to&#xD;
procure-some indeed which a proper and worthy friendship would be the last&#xD;
to exact.'&#xD;
A large crowd had gathered into the court room, attracted by the vehemence&#xD;
of the young lawyer's declamation. He was an eloquent speaker, and lie&#xD;
speech was telling upon the bystanide -,  He saw it, and it stimulated him to&#xD;
oontinually increasing endeavor.&#xD;
'There is a vulgar maxim that there is nothing to be lost by the asking of&#xD;

cessful experience in this respect, while it reflects no great honor upon his&#xD;
sincerity or even upon his ingenuity, pays a consideration to the 'source from&#xD;
which these favors flow, which it is impossible to be considered as in the small-&#xD;
est degree respectful. 'I warn him this day of the necessity to beware how he&#xD;
abuses an influence whiclshis every action shows that he is conscious of exerting.&#xD;
There is a decorum which men, even of the greatest ability, when in the en-&#xD;
joyment of honors, even thode the most fairly won, cannot neglect with impunity.&#xD;
Let those, then, especially beware, the success of whose career is mainly depend-&#xD;
ent upon favor. For granting that the power which, strange as it is, he may&#xD;
truly think that he has immeasurably above others succeeded in conciliating,&#xD;
and controlling, is absolute and unlimited, yet when it shall at last of all others'&#xD;
become convinced that such a control is no longer compatible, not only with the&#xD;
appearance of respectability, but ever? with its own security, and shall, as it&#xD;
assuredly will, withdraw from him the favor in which he seems to live, and move'&#xD;
and have his being, he must then know how vain will be the late pursuit of&#xD;
those other and higher means of success ::midci it has been his constant habit to&#xD;
neglect. And even if this should not ome to pass, if dullness shall never be&#xD;
ble to be conscious of, and to resist a c".. rol which binds it like the spell of&#xD;
the charmer, surely, in a country so free ad so humane in all its institutions&#xD;
except its courts of justice, in a country w 're there are so many good and&#xD;
brave men-men who have been good enon i th md brave enough to resist and to&#xD;
destroy every other form of tyranny, it is n ".to much to expect that the time&#xD;
must come and come soon, when this last foray a'nst yield to the necessities of&#xD;
an matancing civilization; and follow the fate of t hese which have gone before&#xD;
it. Sm y, surely, it cannot long remain, that a free people, who have broken&#xD;
the last shackle of political despotism, must continue to bow in ,abject submis-&#xD;
ion before another which is the more odious, because thhir own hands have&#xD;
created it, and because their own hands may peaceably destroy it.'&#xD;
Mr. Mobley spoke for half an hour in this strain, during many parts of&#xD;
which, Mr. Sandidge, smiling as he wasy was rather piteous to be seen ; and&#xD;
when lie spoke of the merits of theplea itself, Tommy Rickles, but that he had&#xD;
the great Mr. Sandidge for his friend, would have felt as if he ought to be in the&#xD;
peaitentiary.&#xD;
The judge had odee or twice opened his mouth for the purpose of arresting&#xD;
the speaker and fining him for, contempt ; but Mobley's passion had terrified his&#xD;
weak mind, and he had not the nerve to do it. When the last sentence of this&#xD;
'terrible philippic was spoken, with feeble desperation he beckoned the sheriff to&#xD;
him. Eis adversary paused, and fixed his eyes, which rolled and burned like&#xD;

back in his chair, and bowed his head in the unutterable anguish of feeling that&#xD;
one more, and he a mere boy, had assaulted him in his very castle, and van-&#xD;
quished him. He dwelt in the latter part of his speech most solemnly upon the&#xD;
grave responsibilities of courts, which sat in the last resort upon the trial of&#xD;
the rights of citizens, In the absence of a high court for the correction of&#xD;
errors, every judge should, and every upright one would hesitate in pronouncing&#xD;
a judgment which was to be final and irrevocable. With some of the ihost&#xD;
eloquent and touching observations upon this sentiment, he closed his speech,&#xD;
His Honor had determined to charge the jury in favor of the defendant. He&#xD;
w s from principle and -from habit (a habit much more common then than now)&#xD;
opposed to the payment of interest on open accounts ; and from principle and&#xD;
habit much more opposed to the payment of usurious interest. Ire had gotten&#xD;
it into his head that not only was usury condemned in the Bible, but that it&#xD;
had been mainly instrumental in the overthrowv of the great empires of the&#xD;
ancient world, particularly the Roman. For some wag had told him that the&#xD;
latter was once publicly sold and bought by a celebrated usurer, one I)idy&#xD;
Julian, under an execution of fieri facias. Being by his position, one of the&#xD;
conservators of the\ public safety, he had resolved'to prevent if possible any&#xD;
such disaster to his native country, by rebuking and punishing this greatest&#xD;
vice of society whenever it came in his way, let it assume whatever disguise it&#xD;
might. In this renewal of open accounts, he imagined that he dimly perceived&#xD;
an attempt to evade the law, and -had made up his mind when Mr. Sandidge&#xD;
had  concluded, to oh ar g e  upon. it, like a squadron of horse.  But&#xD;
Mobley had, in the very absence of all opportunity of argument, cast such an&#xD;
amount of ridicule upon that motion, that he gravely doubted whether such a&#xD;
charge be right. Besides, Mobley had now risen to the rank of those whose&#xD;
ridicule and contempt he was ashamed and afraid to incur, lie, therefore'&#xD;
refused' sullenly to give any instructions; but ordering the ,pleadings to be&#xD;
handed to the jury, sent them to their room. Half an hour afterwards having&#xD;
returned to the box, they wei'e asked if they had agreed upon a verdict. 1'he&#xD;
foreman, a little dark man, with short, straight up hair, and a sharp voice, rose&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
May it please the cote, we has not ; we desires to ask your honor, if upon&#xD;
the provosa --'&#xD;
'I don't want to hear of your provosoes. Go back to your room, and ind a&#xD;
verdict, or make a mis-trial, I have no instructions to give on your provosoes.'&#xD;
The little man' dodged, turned quickly and led his followers back. They&#xD;
agreed to disagree ; ten of the number not being able to see any usury in the&#xD;
consideration, while two Sandidge men contended then, and ever afterwards&#xD;
persisted in contending, that it was plain as day.&#xD;

And now it was the afternoon ; the sun was fast declining. Unless the court&#xD;
could get fifteen or twenty miles on its way home to-day, it would not reach it,&#xD;
and see its family by to-morrow night. /Basiness had to be despatched right&#xD;
away everbody knew, or be left undone. ,Mr. Mobley had a money rule to take&#xD;
against the eheriff.. That keeper of the county had been in some anxiety all&#xD;
the forenoon on account of it, but now he was at his ease since-he had consulted&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge.       S&#xD;
'What are you scared. about? Don't you see that he's bent on starting home&#xD;
this evening?'&#xD;
'Bat I can't make a showing, because I've spent the money.'&#xD;
'How much have you got about you at this particular time?'&#xD;
'Twenty dollars.'&#xD;
'Hand It over to me. It will do for you and me too for the present.'&#xD;
The sheriff paid it over.. -&#xD;
The last docket was closed ; in the intermission of court for dinner, the jury&#xD;
for the next term had been drawn those of this term were discharged. The&#xD;
judge took out his watch.        -&#xD;
'May its please your Honor,' began Mr. Mobley, 'I desire to take a rule&#xD;
against the sheriff.'&#xD;
'Will it be resisted?'     .&#xD;
'It will, may it please your Honor,' answered Mr. Sandidge. 'Mr. Sheriff go&#xD;
to my office and bring mte the Acts of the last Legislature. Bring those of the&#xD;
two last, if youplease, Mr. Sheriff. I disremember which it is that contains&#xD;
the law I wish to refer to. I ask the indulgence of the court for only a few&#xD;
minutes until I can make out the showing.&#xD;
'Will tIere be any other rules or orders to be made ?' asked the judge im-&#xD;
patiently.,.a.t&#xD;
'I have'several,' Mr. Sandidge answered; 'but unless your Honor could hold&#xD;
over to-morrow, I shall be obliged to postpone taking them until the next term,?-&#xD;
as this rule will take up all the balance-of this afternoon, probably.&#xD;
The sheriff was going slowly towards the do r ; 'come back here, sir,' bawled&#xD;
the judge, rising, his temper all gone. 'This court has got powers ; it may be&#xD;
insulted ; it may be abused ; but it has got powers ; it has got privileges ! Ad-&#xD;
journ this court till the court in course 1!'&#xD;
'I protest against this disgraceful---,' began Mi'. Mobley. but the sheriff in&#xD;
thundering tones was already announcibg the adjournment, and as his Honor,&#xD;
p    an4 haggard rushed rapidly past him, 'God save the State,' he cried in&#xD;
thankful glc 'and the onerble court!''S&#xD;

'You two and he form a glorious trio in the dispensation of humane justice,'&#xD;
he said bitterly to the sheriff and his lawyer. 'But,' raising his hand and abak-&#xD;
ing it towards the latter, 'your day is passing ; mine is coming.'&#xD;
'I think he will have to wait for his Supreme Court, eb, Mr. Saudidge?' re'&#xD;
marked the sheriff as Mobley, taking the arm of Overton, who had staid till the&#xD;
last moment, walked away to his office.&#xD;
Mr. Sandidge made no answer. but takhig a big chew, smiled thoughtfully&#xD;
and serleusly. In twenty minutes from that time, the two rascals compelled&#xD;
the plaintiff in execution, who had sought the rule, to settle his debt by taking&#xD;
the sheriff's note at twelve months without interest, also deducting the fee which&#xD;
had ben paid to Mr. Sandidge for defending him as he said 'from them disgrace.&#xD;
ful proceedanecs.'&#xD;
'And what do you think of Georgia justice?' asked Mr. Mobley, after he had&#xD;
reached his office.&#xD;
'Oar courts make as good a show as a caravan of wild beasts, do they not?'&#xD;
'Such scenes as those to-day must surely happen very seldom"&#xD;
'Seldom I I tell you they happen frequently.'&#xD;
'In all the circuits?'&#xD;
'No: in some of them, thank God, there are men who are neither fools nor&#xD;
rascals. But our miserable judiciary system will not allow a-man to remain&#xD;
,   very long on the bench, however learned and upright he may go upon it, with.&#xD;
out his at least tending to become .one or the other of these characters. The&#xD;
possession of unlimited power makes tyrants of the very best men, while it is&#xD;
notorious that our judges when they come off the bench are worse lawyers thau&#xD;
they are when they go upon it. Why, what you saw is no worse than what be&#xD;
frequently occurred here. The miserable dolt used to crowd me, until I felt that&#xD;
I must resist or be a collared slave. Tie knows now, however, I think, that I&#xD;
am not afraid of him.'&#xD;
'He is now evidently afraid of you.'&#xD;
'I do not know as to that.' Mr. Mobiey brushed the hair from his forehead,&#xD;
and looked as though he did know as to that.&#xD;
'You have passed your ordeal at last, and will hereafter be able at least to&#xD;
divide the control of the court.'&#xD;
'Do you think so?'&#xD;
'There is no doubt of it. le is evidently hacked.'&#xD;
'I hope you are not mistaken ; for humiliating as it is to a gentleman's sense&#xD;
of propriety and decency, he must, in order to attain professional success, either&#xD;
become a favorite of the court or make the court afraid of him. Between the&#xD;
two, unhappy as is the choice of either. he cannot for a moment besitate.'&#xD;
The student made no answer, but parted with him, and having ordered his&#xD;
horse, rode slowly back to Mr. Parkinson's.&#xD;

by the very few persons now living, who knere  the    Due&#xD;

decay that j have ever known to befall a village. It had not been&#xD;
laid off in its beginning upon any definite plan It seemed, indeed,&#xD;
t  have become a village unexpectedly to itself and to every body&#xD;
else notwithstanding the fact that, instead of being in a hurry to be-&#xD;
cone so, it took its own time, and that amounted to some years. The&#xD;
Dukes first establisheda blakmith' rshop-thenin, a store. Both&#xD;
prospered. After some time yothpr persons camnein and buying a&#xD;
little ground, settled on botlhi des of the road, (a winding road it&#xD;

hen the Dukeserew veambitions, and had 'the place called Dukes-&#xD;
bdiugh. It grew on until this fariily left the place, some for the&#xD;
cdenies farther west, and some for the grave. Then decay set in at&#xD;
once, and to day a wretched log house on one side of the present&#xD;
road and fit to be used for no purpose whatever, is the only sign of&#xD;
a relic of ancient Dukesborouglate upon the causes of its fall. The&#xD;
places owoulhuman habitation are like those who inhabit them. _ Some&#xD;
persons die in infancy, some in childhood, some in yotuth, some at&#xD;
middle-age, some at three score"'ang ten, and somme linger yet longer'&#xD;
'ut the last, in their own times, die as surely as many of the former.&#xD;
Methusaleh lived to nine hundred and sixty and eight years, but&#xD;
then he died. The account in Genesis, of those first generations&#xD;
of men, is, after all, I think, a melancholy one. The three last&#xD;
words, closing the history of every one of them, are to me very&#xD;
sad, 44nd he died.'&#xD;
So it   with the places wherein mortals dwell. Some of them be-&#xD;

When Josiah Lorriby came into the neighborhood to  eep a school,&#xD;

brother or sister to go along' with me, my parents, although they&#xD;

rUMO OuS TALES.&#xD;
&#xD;
were anxious' for me to begin, were about to conclude to give it up,&#xD;
when, fortunately, it was ascertained that William Williams, a big&#xD;
fellow, whose widowed mother resided' near to us,intended to go&#xD;
one term and complete his education, preparatory to being made&#xD;
the better fitted for a prospect of some ambition which he had m.&#xD;
view. His way lay by our door, and as he was one of the most&#xD;
accommodating persons in the world, he kindly proffered to take&#xD;
charge of me. Without a moment's hesitation, and with much&#xD;
gratitude, this offer was accepted, and I was delivered over into his&#xD;
keeping. .&#xD;
William Williams was so near being a man that the little boys&#xD;
use to call him, Mr. Bill Williams, usually wore a stout dress-coat&#xD;
of homespun, with pockets opening upon the outer instead of the&#xD;
inner sde   ots.wit   po any oa time, when  I. was  fatigued  with&#xD;
mne side of the skits.  a.h    a  m      ad   etn upon his&#xD;
walking, have 1 ridden upon his back, my hands resting uo  i&#xD;
shoulders a   rd my feetstanding in those capacious pockets. Mr.&#xD;
Bill promised to take care of i'e, and he kept his wordw.wntt-&#xD;
Onthe first morning when the school' was opened, we went to-&#xD;
gether to it. About one mile and a  Ialf distant stood the school&#xD;
house. .Eighteen by .twenty feet were it~ dnsons. door ad&#xD;
built of logs and covered with clap.boards. It had one door, and&#xD;
oppo'Site.to that a hole in the wall, twoa feet square, whi c rmrled&#xD;
the window. It stood in the corner of a field (having formerly been&#xD;
used as a fodder-house,), and on the brow of a bill, at the foot of&#xD;
which, overshadowed by oak trees, was a noble spring of fresh&#xD;
water. Our way led us by this spring. Just as we reached it,&#xD;
Mr. Bill pointed to the summit and said :&#xD;
Yonder it is, Squire.'facetious-&#xD;
Mr. Bill frequently called me squire, partly from moreaJusticeof&#xD;
ness, and partly from his respect tor my ' er,&#xD;
the Peace.&#xD;
I did not answer. We ascended the hill, and Mr. Bill led me&#xD;
into the presence of the genius of the place.&#xD;
Mr. Josiah Lorriby was a remarkable man, at least in appearance.&#xD;
He was below the middle height, but squarely built. He h low&#xD;
good enough, but hi   ther parts were defective. He h a  lw&#xD;
fgat head, with very short hair and very long ears. His a tms were&#xD;
reasonably long, but his hands and legs were disproportionately&#xD;
short. Many - tales were told of his feet, which he wore in shoes&#xD;
with iron soles. He was sitting on a split-bottom chair, on one&#xD;
side'ef the fire-place  Under him, with his head peering out be-&#xD;
tween the,rounds, sitting on his hind legs, and standing on his fore&#xD;
leg8, was (small yellow dog, without tail or ears. This dog's name&#xD;
.was sum. How ie came by it I never knew. It was, I suppose,&#xD;
&#xD;
70&#xD;
&#xD;
given rperely arbitrarily. I have. frequently had occasion to no-&#xD;
tice that school-masters,,as a class, are wont to bestow uncommon&#xD;
names upon not only their children, but their dogs, and even their&#xD;
horses, whenever they appear to have any of the last mentioned&#xD;
species of property..&#xD;
On the other side of the fire-place, in another split bottom, sat a&#xD;
.       tall, raw-boned woman, with the reddest eyes that I have ever seen.&#xD;
This was Mrs. Mehitable, Mr. Lorriby's wife.&#xD;
When I had surveyed these three personages,---this satyr of a&#xD;
man, this tailless dog, and this red-eyed woman, a sense of fear and&#xD;
helplessness came over me, such as I had never fqlt before, and&#xD;
have never felt Siee. I looked at Mr. Bill Williams, but he was&#xD;
obseirving another pupil and did not notice me. The other pupils&#xD;
eighteen or twenty in number, seemed to be in deep meditation.&#xD;
My eyes passed from one to another of the objects of my dread, but&#xD;
they became finally fastened upon the dog. His eyes also had&#xD;
wandered, but only with vague curiosity around upon all the&#xD;
pupils, until the became finally fixed upon me. We gazed at each&#xD;
other several moments. Though he sat still and    sat still, it&#xD;
seemed to me that we were drawing continually nearer to each&#xD;
other. Suddenly I lifted up my voice and screamed with all my&#xD;
might. It was so sudden and sharp that every body except the&#xD;
woman jumped. She indifferently pointed to the dog. Her husband&#xD;
arose, came to me, and in soothing tones asked what waa the matter.&#xD;
I am scared!' I answered, as'loud as I could speak.&#xD;
'Seared of what, my little man? of the dog ?'&#xD;
'I am scared of all of you I'&#xD;
He laughed with good humor, bade me not be afraid,  lled&#xD;
Rum, talked to us.both,'enjoined upon us to be friends, and propho&#xD;
cied that we would be such-the best 'that ha: ever been in the&#xD;
world.-" The little creature became cordial at once, reared his fore&#xD;
feet upon his master, took them down, reared them upon me, and in&#xD;
the absence of a tail to wag, twisted lis whole hinder parts in&#xD;
most violent assurance that if I should say the word we were friend&#xD;
already. Such kindness, and so unexpected, dissolved myappre-&#xD;
hensions. I was in a condition to accept terms far less liberal. So&#xD;
I acceded, and went to laughing outright. Every body laughed&#xD;
and Rum, who could do nothing better in that line, ran about and&#xD;
barked as joyously as any dog with a tail could have done In the&#xD;
afternoon when school was dismissed. I invited Rum to o home&#xD;
with me; but he, waiting as I supposed, for a more intimate ac-&#xD;
quaintance, declined.&#xD;
CHAPTER HIlLa.&#xD;
It was delightful to consider how auspicious a beginning Ihad made,&#xD;
Other little boys profited by it. Mr. Lorriby had no desire to lose&#xD;

aniyof his scholars, and we all were disposed to make as much of&#xD;
advantage as possible of his apprehension, however unfounded, that&#xD;
on account of'our excessive timidity, our parents might remove us&#xD;
from the school. Besides, we knew that we were-to lose nothing by&#xD;
being on friendly terms with Rum. The dread of the teacher's&#xD;
wife soon passed away. She had but little to say and less to 1o.&#xD;
Nobody had   any notion   of any reason which she    had for&#xD;
coming to the school. At first she occasionly heard a spelling&#xD;
class recite. After a little time she began to conic iiunch less often,&#xD;
and in a few weeks her visits had decreased to one in several days.&#xD;
Mr. Lorriby was not of the sort of schoolmasters whom men use&#xD;
to denominate by the title of knock-down and drag out. He was&#xD;
not such a man as Israel Meadows. But although he was good&#xD;
hearted enough, he was somewhat politic also. Being a new comer,&#xD;
and being poor, he determined to manage his business with due re-&#xD;
gard to the tastes, the wishes, and the prejudices of the community&#xD;
in which ho labored. He decidedly preferred a mild reign but it was&#xD;
said he could easily accommodate, himself to those who required&#xD;
more vigorous policy  lHe soon learned that the latter was the fa -&#xD;
vorite h're. People cemplined that there was little or no whip-&#xD;
pig   Sohw who had read the fable of the frogs who desired a&#xD;
sovereign, were heard to declare that Josiah Lorriby was no better&#xD;
than 'Old King Log.' One patron spoke of taking his children&#xD;
home,placing the boy at the plough and the girl at the spinning wheel.&#xD;
Persons in those days loved their children, doubtless, as well as&#xD;
now; but they had some strange ways of showing their love. The&#xD;
strangest of all was the evident gratification which the former felt&#xD;
when the latter were whipped at school. While they all had a no&#xD;
tion that education was something which it was desirable to get,.it&#xD;
was believed that the impartation of it needed to be conducted in&#xD;
most mysterious ways. The school-house of that. day was, in a&#xD;
manner, a cave of Trophonius, into vhich. urchins of both sexes en-&#xD;
tered amid certain incomprehensible ceremonies, and were ever-&#xD;
lastingly subject and used to be whirled about, body and soul, in a&#xD;
vortex of confusion. I might pursue the analogy and say that,&#xD;
like the votaries of Traphonius, they were not wont to smile until&#xD;
long after this violent and rotary indoctrination, but rather to&#xD;
weep and lament, unless they were brave like Apollonius, or big&#xD;
like Allen Thigpei, and so could bully the priest far enough to have&#xD;
the bodily rotation dispensed with. According to these notions,&#xD;
the principles of the education of books were not to be addressed&#xD;
to the ihind and to the heart; but, if they were expected to stick, they&#xD;
must be beaten with rod into the back. Through this ordeal of&#xD;
painful gere onies had the. risen generation gone, and through the&#xD;
&#xD;
HUMOROUS . TALES.                     7&#xD;
same ordeal they honesty believed that the pres nt generation&#xD;
-    ought to go, and must go. No exception was made in favor of&#xD;
genius. Its back was to be kept as sore as stupidity's ; for, being&#xD;
yoked with the latter, it must take the blows, the oaths, andthe&#xD;
imprecations. I can account for these things in no other way than&#xD;
by supposing that the 'ofd set of persons -had come out of theold&#xD;
system, with minds so bewildered as to be ever 'afterwards incapa-&#xD;
ble 6f thinking upon it in a reasonable manner. In one respect there&#xD;
is a considerable likeness between mankind and some individuals of&#xD;
e brte creation. The dog seems to love best that master who&#xD;
beatse   before giving hui  a hone. I have heard persons say,&#xD;
(those who had carefully studied the nature and habits of the mule,)&#xD;

people of. former times. They lid bden beaten so constantly, and&#xD;
so mysteriously at school, tiet they seemed to entertain a gi"ateul&#xD;
affection for it ever afterwards.  [t was, therefore, with feelings of&#xD;

the nin       w e t in one instance. In that I wilt remember the surprise I felt at&#xD;
the manner in which her case  yas disposed of. tHer name was Susan Pot-&#xD;
ter. She was about twelve years old, and well grown. When she was called&#xD;
up, inquiry was made by the master if any boy present was willing to take upon&#xD;
himeelt the punishment which must otherwise fall upon her. After a moment's&#xD;
silence, Seaborn Byne, a boy of fourteen, rose and presented himself.tae wa&#xD;
good. tempered and fat, and his pants and round jacket fitted d him closely. He&#xD;
advanced with the air of a rau nwho was going to do what was right, with no&#xD;
thought of consequences. Miss Poter unconcernedly went to her seat. '&#xD;
Bat Seaborn soon evinced that he was dissatisfied with a bargain that was&#xD;
so wholly without consideration. I believed then, and 1 believe to this day&#xD;
but for his being so goad a mark he would have received fewer stripes. Bud&#xD;
his rcund fat body and legs stcod so temptingly before the rod, and the latter&#xD;
' fell upon good flesh so entirely through its whole length, that it was really hard&#xD;
to atop. Ho roared with pain so unexpectedly severe, and violently rubbed&#xD;
each spot of recent infliction: \VJaen it was over he came to his seat and looked&#xD;
at Susan Potter. She seemed to - feel like laughing. Seaborn got no synu&#xD;
athy, except from a source, which he despised, that was his younger brother,&#xD;
Joel. - Joel was weeping in secret.&#xD;
'Shutup your mouth,' whispered Seaborn, threatningly-and Joel shut up.&#xD;
Then I distinctly heard Seaborn mutter the following words:&#xD;
' + I ever takes another for her, or for any of'ern, may I be dinged, and then&#xD;
dug up and dinged over again..                       +&#xD;
I have no doubt that he kept his oath, for I continued to know Seaborn&#xD;
Byne until he was an old man, and I never knew a person who persistently&#xD;
held that vicarleus system of school punishment in deeper disgust. What his&#xD;
Ideas were about being 'dinged,' and about Cit it operation being repeated, I did&#xD;
tot know, but I supposed that was so ething, that, if possible, better be&#xD;
avoided.&#xD;
Such doing as these made a great change in the feelings of us little ones.&#xD;
Yet I continued to run the crying schedule. It failed at last, and I went&#xD;
under.-&#xD;
Mr. Lorriby lali it upon' me remorselessly. I had never dreamed that he&#xD;
would give me such a  ogging-me who considered myelf, as every body else&#xD;
considered me-a favorite. Now the charm was gone; the charm of security.&#xD;
It made me very sad. I lost my love for the teacher. I own grew cold to.&#xD;
wards Rum, andRum in his turn grew cold towards me.              .&#xD;
.I a short time Mr. Lorrioy bad gone as nearly all. around the school as it&#xD;
was prudent to go. Every boy but two had received his portion,-some onee,&#xD;
some several times. These two were Mr. Bill Williams, and another big boy,&#xD;
named Jeremiah Hobbes. These were. of course, as secure against harm from&#xD;
Mr. Larriby as they would have been had he been in Guinea. Every girl also&#xD;
had been flogged, or had had a boy flogged fer her, except Betsy Ann Acry,&#xD;
the belle of the school. She was a light-haired, blue-eyed, plump, delicious&#xD;
looking girl, fourteen years old. Now for 1tiss- Betsy Ann A cry, as it was&#xD;
known to every body about the schoolhouse, Mr. Bill Williams had aapartic-&#xD;
1            ty which, though not avowed, was decided. ie had never courted her in set&#xD;
words, but he had observed her from day to day, and noticed her opening lto&#xD;
woma   ood, with constantly increasing desire. He was scarcely a match for&#xD;
her even if they.both had been in condition to marry. He knew this very well.&#xD;
But comiderations of this sort soldom do a young man any good. More often&#xD;

d sired to go there as a  etk in a store. He bad made repeated applications&#xD;
to be tlnenint by Messrs. Bland &amp;amp; Jones, and it was in obedi ice to a hint from&#xD;
hose gontl mLren that he b adetermiiite to tae  a term of finishing off at the&#xD;
school ot Mr Loirihy. This pioet was run out of his mind, even in moments&#xD;
of his fondest imaiinga about Miss Betsy A nui. It would have been not easy&#xD;
to ray which he love the best. e c ksh'p s( ae ed to  ecome nearer and&#xD;
nearer, alter eacti Saturday's visit to town, until at last he had a distinct ofder&#xD;

accepted, to enter upon hi duties in f yurceka, whcn the quarter sesSIon of tbu&#xD;
school wou'd expire.&#xD;
The dign'fied ways of Vr. Bill after this, made considerable impression upon&#xD;
all The school. Even Betsy Ann condescended to turn her eyes oftener in the&#xD;
direction where he happened to be, ard he was almost inclined to g'ory in the&#xD;
lbpe that the possession of one dear object wonld draw the other along with it.&#xD;
At least he felt that i lie should lose the latter, the former wodh  the&#xD;
highest consolation which he could ask. The news of the dist inguished ho or&#xD;
that had b-en conferrel upon him, reached the heads of the school early on the&#xD;
Monday following the eventful Saturday when the business was done. I say&#xD;
beads, for of late Mrs. Mehitable came with her husband almost every day.&#xD;
She received the announcement without emotion.' Mr. Lorrihy, on the other&#xD;

'It wa- a honor to the whole school.' he said.&#xD;
I feels it myslr. iSob i nwar cider all the circumstances. It was obleeged&#xD;

effects of the change of dicipline. Nor did he seem to have any apprehensions&#xD;
on that score. Ed even went so far as to say to Mr. Bill Williams, who had&#xD;
layfully suggested the bare idea of suchta thing, that 'ef old Jo Lorriby -raised&#xD;
is old pole on him, he would pift his blizzard, (as Seaborn facetiously called his&#xD;
knife,) 'into-his paunch. This threat had made his brother Joel extremely&#xD;
untha pp. Hialittle heart was bowed down with the never resting fear and be-&#xD;
 lief that Seaborn was destined to commit the crime of murder upon the body of&#xD;
Mr. Lorriby. 'On the other hand S.aborn wa- constantly vexed by the sight&#xD;
qf the scores of floggings which Joel received. Poor Joel had, dbmehow, in the&#xD;
beginning of his studies, gotten upon the wrong road, and as nobody ever&#xD;
brought him back to the starting.point, he was destined, it seemed, to wander&#xD;
about lost evermore. The. more floggings he got, the more hopeless and wild&#xD;
were his efforts at extrication. It was unfortunate for hin that his brother&#xD;
took any interest in his condition. Seaborn had great contempt for him, but&#xD;
yet he remembered that he was his brother, and his brother's heart would not&#xD;
'allow itself to feel no concern. That concern manifested itself in endeavoring&#xD;
to teach Joel himself out of schoAl, and in flogging him himself, by way of pre-&#xD;
venting Joel's having to submit to that disgrace at the hands of old Joe. So&#xD;
-eager was Seaborn in this brotherly design, and so indocile was Joel, that for&#xD;
every flogging which the latter received from the master, he got from two to&#xD;
three from Seaborn. Amongst all these evils, floggings from  Mr. Lorriby,&#xD;
floggings from Seaborn, and the abiding apprehension that the former was des-&#xD;
tined to be killed by the latter, Joel Byne was a case which-was to be pitied.&#xD;
'It ar' a disgrace,',said Mr. Bill to me, one morning as we were going to&#xD;
school; 'and I wish Mr. Larrabee knowed it. Betwixt him and Sebe that&#xD;
'little imiercent individiel ar' bent 'on being' useded up. It beats all natur. Ole&#xD;
Larrabee ar' bad enough,'but Sebe ar' wusser yit. The case ar' wusser than if&#xD;
there was two Larrabees:. In all my experence I has not seed jist sich a ease.&#xD;
it ar' beyant hope.'&#xD;
Mr. Bill's sympal by made him serious, and almost gloomy. I believe that at&#xD;
That moment both Betsy Ann Acry aod the clerkship were out of his mind. The&#xD;
road on which 1 he ITyne's tame to school met ours a few rods from the Spring,&#xD;
we were now at the latter place. Mr. Bill had scarcely finished his last seni-&#xD;
tence when we heard behind us the screams of a child. We should have been&#xD;
much alarmed if we had not known where they were and what was their cause.&#xD;
'Thar it is aging ' said Mr. Bill; 'at it good and soon; It do 'beat everything&#xD;
in this blessed world, ef it don't, ding me.'&#xD;
We looked behind us. Here came Joel at full speet, hatless, his spelling&#xD;
book in one hand, and his dinner baslket, without cover, hanging from the other,&#xD;
screaming with all his might. 'Fifty yards behind him ran Seaborn, who had&#xD;
been delayed, as it seemed, by having to stop to pick up the bucket cover and&#xD;
Joel's hit, as he had them both in his hands.&#xD;
'Stop, you son-of-a bitch,' he cried.&#xD;
Just before reaching the spot where we were, he overtook the fugitive, threw&#xD;
him down, took out of his hand the spelling book, opened it, and then getting&#xD;
upon him, fastening his arms with his own knees, 'Now,' said he, 'you rascal,&#xD;
spell crucifix.'&#xD;
Joel attempted to obey.&#xD;
'S again, you little devil ! S-i, s-i! Ding my skin, if you shan't lam it ef I.&#xD;
have to eram every bit of it intoo your mouth with my fist.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Look a here, Sebe !' interposed Mr. Bill; fun's fun, but too much is too&#xD;
much.'&#xD;
Now what these words were intended to be preliminary to, there was no op-&#xD;
portunity of ascertaining; 'for just then Mr. Josiah Lorriby, who had diverged&#xD;
from his own way ia order to drink at the spring, presented himself.&#xD;
'What air you about thar, Sebion Byne?'&#xD;
Seaborn arose, and though lie considered his conduct not only justifiable, but&#xD;
proper, he looked a little crest-fallen.&#xD;
'Ah, indeed     You're the assistant.teacher, air you?  Interfering with t/m&#xD;
business, and myrrights, and my duties, and my -, hem. Let us all go to the&#xD;
school-house now. Mr. Byne will manage business hereafter. 1, as f or me, 1&#xD;
paint no whar now. Come, Mr. Byne, less go to school.'&#xD;
Mr. Larriby and Seaborn went on, side by side. Mr. Bill, looked as if he&#xD;
were highly gratified. 'Ef he don't get it now, he never will.'&#xD;
Alas for Joel! Delivered from Seaborn, he was yet more miserable than be-&#xD;
fore, and he forgot his own griefs in his pity for the impendingfate of Mr. Lorriby&#xD;
and his apprehension for the ultimate consequence of this day's work to his&#xD;
brother. He pulled me alittle behind Mr. Bsl!, and tremblingly whispered&#xD;
'Poor Mr. Lorriby ! l)o you reckon they wi lhag Seahy, Phil ?'&#xD;
'What for?' I asked.&#xD;
'For killing Mr Lorriby r&#xD;
I answered that I hoped not. This was as far as 1' could go, for I had some&#xD;
confidence myself in Seaborn's desperate resolution.&#xD;
The matter was settled before we two had reac. ed the house. As we got to&#xD;
the door Mr, Lorriby began to lay on, and Seaborn to roar. The laying on&#xD;
and the roaring lasted until the master was satisfied. Joel and I had staid out-&#xD;
side. When it was over I looked into Joel's face. It was radiant with joyful&#xD;
smiles. -Happy little fellow ! Sea born'would not he hung! That delusion&#xD;
was gone forever.&#xD;

CJiHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
having broken the ice up')n Seaborn, Mr. Lorriby went ibto the sport of&#xD;
flogging  him  whenever  he  felt like  it. Seaborn's revolutionary senti-&#xD;
ments grew  deeper and stronger constantly. But he was now, of course, hope-&#xD;
lesief accomplishing any'results himself, and he knew that the only chances&#xD;
were to enlist Jeremiah hlobbes, or Mr. Bill Williams, and make him the&#xD;
leader in the enterprise. Very soon, however, one of these chances was lost.&#xD;
Hobbes received and accepted t oflerto become an overseer, and Seaborn's&#xD;
hopes were now fixed upon Mr. liill alone. That also was destined soon to be&#xD;
lost by the latter's prospective clerkship. Besides, Mr. Bill being even tdm-&#xD;
lpered, and never having received, and being never likely to receive any provo-&#xD;
cation from Mr. Lorriby, ithe prospect of making anything out of him was&#xD;
gloomy enough. In vain Seaborn raised inundoes concerning his pluck. In&#xD;
vain he tried every other expedient,;even to secretly drawing on Mr.-Bill's slate&#xD;
a picture of a very little man flogging a very , big boy, having written as well&#xD;
as he could, the name of Mr. Lorriby near the former, and that of Mr. Bill near&#xD;
the latter. Seaborn could not disguise himself, and Mr. Bill, when he saw the&#xD;
pictures, informed the artist that if he did not mind what he was about, he&#xD;
would get a worse beating than ever Joe Larrabee gave him. Seaborn had&#xD;
but one hope left ; but thatinvolved some little delicacy, and could be managed&#xD;
only by its own circumstances. It might do, and it might not do. If Seaborr&#xD;

had been a praying boy, he would have prayed that if anything was to be made&#xD;
oat of this, it would come before Mr. Bill should leave. Sure enough it did&#xD;
come. Just one week before the quarter was out, it came. Seaborn was in&#xD;
ecs'acie . Let us set what it was that so exalted him.&#xD;
Miss Betsy Ann Acry had heretofore escaped correction for any of her short&#xD;
comings, although they were not few. She was fond of ni ebief, and no more&#xD;
afraid of Mr4 Lorriby than Mr. Bll Williams was. -Indeed. Mss Betsy Ann&#xD;
considered herself to be a woman, and she had b en heard to say that a whip-&#xD;
ping was something which $ihe wo rd take from nobody. Mr. Lorriby smild&#xD;
at her mischievous tricks, but Mrs Lorripy fr wned. These ladies became to&#xD;
dislike each other. The younger, when in her frotics, frequently noticed the&#xD;
elder give her husband a look which was expressive of muchnmeanog. Seaborn&#xD;
had al:o noticed this, and the worse Miss Acry grew, te oftener Mrs. Lorriby&#xD;
came to the school._ He had come to believe fully that tl e.o1ject which the&#xD;
female Lorriby had inr:ing at all.was to protect the male. A bright thought I&#xD;
He communicated it to isAcry, and slyly hinted several times that he be.&#xD;
lieved she was'afraid cf Old Â°Red Eye, .as he denominated the master's wife.&#xD;
Miss Acry indignantly repelled every sneh insinuation, and became only the&#xD;
bolder in what she said and what she did. Si aborn knew  that the Larriby's&#xD;
were well aware of Mr. Bill's preference for the girl, and be intensely enjoyed&#xD;
her temerity. But it was hard to satisfy him that she was not afraid of Old&#xD;
Red Eye. If. Old Red Eye had not been there, Betsy Am would I ave done&#xD;
so and so. The reason why she did not do so and so., yas because old Red Eye&#xD;
was about. Alas for human nature-male and female! Betsy Ann wtut on&#xD;
and on, until she was brought to'a hat. The occasion was thus:&#xD;
There was in the school a boy, of r bout my own size, and of a vear'or twb&#xD;
older, wbcse name was Martin Grarger. He was somewhat of a pitiful looking&#xD;
creeture-wlined when he spoke, and'rwas frequently in quarrels, not only with&#xD;
the boys, but with the girls  He was suspected if soviet mes playing the part&#xD;
of spy and informant to-the Lorriby's, both of whom  tented him  with trore&#xD;
con iderat on than any other pupil received, except Mr. Bill W illinm. Miss&#xD;
Betsy Ann cord ially disliked him, and she honored myself by calling me her&#xD;
favo ite in the.wbole school.    .&#xD;
Now Martin and myself got ourselves very unexpectedly info a fight. I I-d&#xD;
divided my molasses with him at dinner time. for wteks tud wi eks. A few of&#xD;
the pupils, whose parents could affpd to have that luxury, wecre accustomed to&#xD;
carry it to school in vials. I usually att my part, afier boning a hole in my&#xD;
biscuit, and then filling it up. I have oten wished, siue I have been grown,&#xD;
that I could relish that-preparation as I relished it vhen a boy. But as we&#xD;
grow old{:r our tastes change. Martin Granaer relished the juicy even more&#xD;
than I. In all my observations. 1 have never known a person, of any description,&#xD;
why was as fond of molasses as he was. It did me good to se eahim eat it. He&#xD;
never bronght any himself, but he used to hint, in iis whining wny, that the&#xD;
time was not distant when his father would have a whole keg full, and when&#xD;
le should brinmit to school in his father's bi snuff bottle, whieh was well known&#xD;
to us-all. . Although I was not so sanguine of t e realization of his presl, ect s&#xD;
he seemed t . be, yet I had not on that accountt became tired of ftn fishing him.&#xD;
I only grew tired of his presence while at my dinner, auf I availed myself of a&#xD;
triflingclispute one day to shut down upon him. I not only did not invite him&#xD;
to partake of my molasses. but I rejected his proposition 1o do so wi'hont invi-&#xD;
tation. He had been dividing it with me so long that I believe he thQught my&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
right to cut him off now was stopped. He watched me as I bored my holke&#xD;
and poured in, and ate and even wasted the precious fluid. I could not con&#xD;
sume it atll. When I had finished cat in, I pouted water into the vial and&#xD;
made what we called 'beverage.' I won d drink a little, then shake it and hold&#xD;
it up before me. The golden bubbles shown gloriously in the sun light. I had&#xD;
not said a word to M irin during these it  resting operations, nor oven looked&#xD;
towards him. But I knew that his eyes were upon me end the vial. Just as I&#xD;
svollowed the last drop, ils lull heart could bear no more, and he uttered a cry&#xD;
of pain. I turned to him and asked him what was the matter. The question&#xD;
seemed to be considered as adding insult to injustice.&#xD;
'Corn deternally trive your devilish hide,' he anwei-ed, and gave me the full&#xD;
benefit of hip clenched hand upon my stomach. Ie was afterwards heard to&#xD;
say that 'thar vas the place whar he wanted to hit lust.' We closed, scratched,&#xD;
pulled hair, and otherwise strugled until we were separated. Martin went&#xD;
immediately to Mr. Lorriby, gave his version of the brawl, and just us the&#xD;
school was to be dismissed for the day, I was called up and flogged without&#xD;
inquiry and without cxplanntion.&#xD;
Miss Betsy Ann Acry had seen the fight. When I came to my seat, crying&#xD;
bitterly, her indignation could not contain itself .&#xD;
'Mr. Lo ribee,'.she said, her red cheeky growing rdder, 'you have whipped&#xD;
that boy for nothing.'&#xD;
Betsy Ann, with all of her pluck,had never gone so far as this. Mr. Lorrihy&#xD;
turned pale and looked at his wife. Her red eyes fairly glistened wiJi fire. Ho&#xD;
understood it, and said to Betsy Ann in a hesitating tone,-&#xD;
'You had better keep your advice to yourself.'&#xD;
'I did not give you any advice. I just said you whipped that boy for noth-&#xD;
ing, and I said the truth.'&#xD;
'Aint that advice, madam?'&#xD;
'I am no madam. I ihank you, sir ; and if that's advice -.-.'&#xD;
'Shet up your mouth, Betsy Ann Acry.'&#xD;
Yes sir,' said B. A.,' very loud, and she fastened her pretty, pouting lips t-&#xD;
gethr, elevated her head, inclined a little to one sideand seemed umnusedly&#xD;
awaiting further ordrs.&#xD;
The em d1e Lorriby here rose, went to her husband, and whispered earnestly&#xD;
to him. He hesitatel and then resolved.&#xD;
'CMme here to me, Betsy Ann Amrv.'&#xD;
She went up as gaily as if she expe ted n present.&#xD;
'I am going to whip Btsy Ann Acry. Ef any boy here wants to take it for&#xD;
her, he c in no v step iorrards'&#xD;
Betsy Ann patted her foot, and Iook:ol neither to the right nor to the left,&#xD;
nor yet behind hr.&#xD;
When a substitute wis invited to appear, the hiuse was as atilas a grave&#xD;
yard. I rubbed my legs apoligetically, .nd looked up at Seaborn who sat by&#xD;
me.&#xD;
'No sir; if I do may I be dinged, and then du-t up and -' I did not listen&#xD;
to thf remainder, and as no one elsa seemed disposed to vo'unteer,'and as the&#xD;
difficuhy was b-oucrht about upon my own.aecoun, and us Betsy Ann liked me&#xD;
and I liked B tsy Ann, I made a de=perm e resolution, and rose and pres nted&#xD;
myself. Busy Ann appeared to be disgusted.&#xD;
'rtdon't think I would whip that child any more to-day, if I was in your&#xD;
py1ce, especially for ctar fpik'sdoings.'&#xD;

'That's jist as you say.&#xD;
'Well, I say go back to your seat, Phil.'.&#xD;
I obeyed, and felt relieved and proud of myself. Mr. Lorriby began to&#xD;
straighten his switch. Then I, and all the other pupils, looked at Mr. Bill&#xD;
Williams.&#xD;
CHATER VII.&#xD;
Oh ! what an argument was going on in Mr. Bill's breast. Vain had been&#xD;
all efforts, heretofore made, to bring him in eny way in collision with the Lor-&#xD;
ribies. He had even kept himself out of all combinations to get a little holiday&#xD;
by an innocent ducking, and useless had been all appeals, heretofore, to his sym..&#xD;
pathies ; for he was'like the rest who had been through the ordeal of&#xD;
the schools, and had grown to believe that it did more harm than gotd. If it&#xD;
had been any hody but Betsy Ann Acry, he would have been unmoved. But&#xD;
itwas Betsy Ann Acry, and he had been often heard to say that if Betsy Ann&#xD;
Acry should have to be whipped, he should take upon himself the responsibility&#xD;
of seeing that that must not be done. And now that contingency had come. What&#xD;
ought to be done? How was this responsibility to le discharged?  Mr. Bill&#xD;
wished that the female Lorriby had stayed away that day. He did not"know&#xD;
exactly why he wished it, but he wished it. To add to his other diftleulties,&#xD;
Miss Betsy Ann had never given any token of her reciprocation of his regard ;&#xD;
for now that the novelty of the future clerkship had worn away, she had re-&#xD;
turned to her old habit of never seeming to notice that there was such a person&#xD;
as himself. But the idea of a switch falling upon her, whose body, trom the&#xD;
crown of her head to the soles of her feet, was so-precious to him, outweighed&#xD;
every other consideration, and le made up his mind to be as good as his word,&#xD;
and take the responsibility. Just as the male Lorriby, (the female by his side,)&#xD;
was about to raise the switch.&#xD;
Stop a minute, Mr. Lorrabee,' he exclaimed, advancing in a highly excited&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
Therteacher lowered his arm and retreated one step, looking ia little -irreso-&#xD;
lute. His wife advanced one step., and looking straight at Mr. Bill, her robust&#xD;
frame rose at- least an inch higher.&#xD;
'Mr. Larrabee II- ah- don't exactly consider myself -' ah - as a scholar&#xD;
here now;' because- ah- I expect to move to Dukesborough in a ;few days,&#xD;
and keep store thar, 'for Mr. Bland and .Jones.'&#xD;
To his astonishment, this announcement, so impressive heretofore, failed of&#xD;
the slightest effect now, when, of all tines, an effect was desired. Mr. Lor-&#xD;
eribyp in answer to a sign from his wife, had recovered his lost ground, and&#xD;
looked placidly upon him, but answered nothing.&#xD;
'I say,' repeated Mr. Bill distinctly, as if he supposed he had not been heard.&#xD;
'I say that I expect in a few days to move to Dukesboaough ; to live thar,&#xD;
to keep tore thar for Mr. Bland and Jones.'&#xD;
'Well Williams, I think I have heard that before, I want to hear you&#xD;
talk about it some time when it aint school time, and when we aint so busy&#xD;
as we air now at the present.      ,&#xD;
'well, but -.' persisteded Mr: Bill:&#xD;
'Well, but?' enquired Mr: L:&#xD;
'Yes sir,' answered the former, insistingly:'&#xD;
'Well but what? Is this case got anything to do with it?  Is she got&#xD;
any thing to, do with it'?'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
In cose it have not,' answered Mr: B., sadly:&#xD;
'Well, what makes you tell us of it now, at the present?' Oh! what a&#xD;
big word was that us, then, to Josiah Lorriby.&#xD;
'Mr. Larrabee,' urged Mr: B., in as persuasive accents as he could em-&#xD;
ploy;. 'No sir, Mr: Larrabee, it havenot got any thing to do with it; but yet -'&#xD;
'Well-yit what, William?'&#xD;
'Well, Mr: Larrabee, I thought, as I was a goin to quit school soon ; and&#xD;
as I was a going to move to, Dukcaborough,-as I was a goin right outen&#xD;
your school, intoo Dukesborough as it war-to keep store thar---may be you&#xD;
mount, as a favor, do me a favor before I left.'&#xD;
'Well! may I. be dinged, and then dug up and dinged over agin !' This was&#xD;
said in a suppressed whisper, by a person at my side. 'Beggin ! beggin ! ding&#xD;
his white-livered hide- -be-g-gin!'&#xD;
'Why, William,' replied Mfr. L.,' ef it ware convenant, and the favor war&#xD;
not too much, it mout be that I mout grant it.'&#xD;
'I thought you would, Mr. Larrabee. The favor aint a big one. Least&#xD;
ways, it aint a big one to you. It would be a mighty -' But Mr. Bill thought&#xD;
he could hardly trust himself to say how big a one it would be to himself.&#xD;
'Well, what is it, William?'&#xD;
'Mr. Larrabee !-- Sir, Mr. Larrabee, I ax it as a fv or of you, not to  wip&#xD;
Betsy Ann--which is Miss Betsf Ann Acry.'&#xD;
'Thar, now !' groaned Seaborn, and 1'. ed his head in despair.&#xD;
The male Larriby looked upon the Â£cmale. Her face had relaxed somewhat&#xD;
from its stern expression. She answered his glance by one which implied a&#xD;
conditional affirmative.&#xD;
'ef Betsy Ann Acry will behave herself, and keep her impudence to herself,&#xD;
I will let her off this time.'&#xD;
All eyes turned to Betsy Ann. I  ver saw her look so fine as she raised&#xD;
up her head, tossed her yellow rig .s back, and said, in a tone increasing in&#xD;
loudness from beginning to end;:-&#xD;
'But Betsy Ann Acry wont do it.'&#xD;
'Hello agin thar!' whispered Seab'rn, and raised his head. His dying hopes&#xD;
of a big row were revived. This was the last opportunity, and he was as eager&#xD;
as if the last dollarhe ever expected to makeha been pledged upon the event.&#xD;
I have never forgotten his appearance, as with his legs wide apart, his hands&#xD;
upon his knees, his lips apart, but his teeth nearly closed, he gazed upon that&#xD;
scene.'&#xD;
'Lorriby, the male, was considerably disconcerted, and would have compro-&#xD;
promised ; but Lorriby, the female, again, in an instant, resumed her hostile&#xD;
attitude, and this time her great eyes looked like two balls of fire. She'con-&#xD;
,centrated their gaze upon Betsy Ann, with a ferocity which was appalling.&#xD;
Betsy Ann tried to meet them, and did for one monent, but in another she found&#xD;
she could not hold out longer ; so she buried her face in her hands and sobbed.&#xD;
Mr. Bill could endure no more.&#xD;
'The fact ar',' he cried,'that I am goin to take the responsibility. Conshe-&#xD;
quenchesmay be conshesjuenches, but I shall take the responsibility.' His&#xD;
countenance was that of a man who had made up his mind. It had come at&#xD;
last, and we were perfectly happy.&#xD;

The female Lorriby turned her 'eyes front Betsy Ann and fixed them Fte'adfly&#xD;
on Mr. Bill. She advaned a step forward, and raised her arsra nd placed&#xD;
them on hr Ades. The male Lorby placed himself immediately behind his -&#xD;

It is true that Seaborn had been counted upon for a moro iiprtant work&#xD;

Such was the height of Mr. Bill's excitement, that ho did not even s' em to&#xD;

was mrcle up, and he wan going right on to his purpose.&#xD;

CHAPTER Viii.&#xD;
"Ohi what a fall was there, my countrymen !&#xD;
Then you and I and. all of us fell down !"&#xD;
If the pupils of Josiah Lorriby's school had had the knowledge of all tongues ;&#xD;
if they had been familiar with the histories of all thy base men of all the ages,&#xD;
they could have found no words in which to ch tracrerize, and no person with&#xD;
whom tg compare Mr. Bill Williams. If they had known what it was to be a&#xD;
traitor, -they might have admitted that he was more alike this, the most&#xD;
despicable of all characters, than any other.. But they would lIave argued that&#xD;
he Was baser than all other traitors, because he had betrayed, not only others,&#xD;
but himself. Mr. Bill Williams, the big boy ; the future resident of Dukes-&#xD;
borough ; the expectant, clerk ; the vindicator of persecuted girlhood, in the&#xD;
person  f the girl he loved ; the pledge taker of r sponsibitities,-that he&#xD;
should have taken the pains, just. before he was going away, to degrade him-&#xD;
self by proposing to take  upon his own shoulders tho. i od that had never be-&#xD;
fore descended but upon the backs and 1 gs of children ! Poor Seaborn Byne!I&#xD;
If I ever s iw expressed in one human being's countenance, disgust, anger and&#xD;
abject hopelessness, I saw them as I turned to look at him. lie spoke not one&#xD;
word, not even in whispers, but he looked as if he muld never mote place con-&#xD;
fidence in mortal flsh.&#xD;
When Mr. B.1 had concluded his ultimatum, the female Lorriby's arms&#xD;
came down, and the male Lori iby's head went up. rThe y sent each the other a&#xD;
smile. Both were smart enough to be satisfied. The latter was more than&#xD;
satisfied.&#xD;
-I am proud this'lay of Williati  Williams. It air so, and I can but say I&#xD;
air proud of him. William, Wllianis were now id a position to stand up and&#xD;
shine in his new spere of action. If he went to Dukesborough to keep store&#xD;
thar; he mout now go saying' that as he had been a good scholar, so he moat&#xD;
expect to be good clerk, and fit to be trusted, yea, with thousands upon thou-&#xD;
sands, ef sich mout be the case. But as it was so, and as he have been to us&#xD;
all as it ware, and no difficulties, and no nothin' of the sort, and he ware&#xD;
goin', and it mout be soon ; yea, it mout be to morrow, from this school&#xD;
straight intoo a store, I cannot, nor I cannot. No, far be it. This were a&#xD;
skene too-solemn and too lovely for sich. I cannot, nor I cannot. William&#xD;
Williams may now take his seat.&#xD;
Mr. Bill ob ed. I was glad that he did not look at Betsy Ann as she&#xD;
turned to go4,o hers. But she looked at him. I saw her, and little as I was,&#xD;
I saw also that if he ever had had any chance of winning her, it was gone&#xD;
from him forever. It was now  late in the afternoon, and we were dismiss d.&#xD;
Wit hout saying a word to any one, Mr. Bill took his arhhmatie and satP, (for&#xD;
ciphering, as it was called then, .was his only stuJy). We knew what it&#xD;
meant, for we felt, as will as he, that this was his last day at school, As my&#xD;
getting to school depended upon his'continuance, I did not doubt that it was&#xD;
my 1st also.&#xD;
On the way home, but not until after separating from all the other boys,&#xD;
Mr. B 11 showed some disposition to boast.&#xD;
'You all little fellows was morstous badly sheered this evening, Squire.&#xD;
'Was'nt you scared t oo?' I asked.&#xD;
'Skeered ? I'd like to see the schoolmaster that could skeer me. I steered&#xD;
of Joe Larrabee ?'&#xD;

'Skee'red of who then?  Miss Larrabee? OldRed  Eye?  She mout be&#xD;

how w uld I look goin' into Dukesborough into Mr. Bland and Jones store,&#xD;
right f' om being skewered of old Miss Larrabee ? To be runnin' right intoo Mr.&#xD;
Bland and Jone's store, and old Mehetibilly Larrabee right arter me, or old&#xD;
Joe nuther. It wur well for him that'he never struck Betsy Ann Acry. El&#xD;
he had a struck he-, Jo Larrabee's strikin' days would be over.'&#xD;
'But was'nt yougoin' to-take her yhippin' for her?'&#xD;
'Lookee here, Squire, I didn't take it, did I?'&#xD;
'No; but you said you was ready to take it-'&#xD;
'Poor little fellow !' he said, compassionately. 'Squire, you are yit young in&#xD;
the ways of this sorrowful apd ountimely world. Joe Larrabee knows me, and I&#xD;
knows Joe Lariabee, and as the feller said, that ar'sufficient.'&#xD;
We were now at our gate. Mr. Bill bade me good evening, and passed os&#xD;
and thus ended his pupilage and mine at the school of Josiah Lorriby.&#xD;

MISS PEA, MISS SPOUTER AND THE YANKEE&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"Companions&#xD;
That do converse, and waste the time together,&#xD;
.Whose souls do hear an equal yoke of love."&#xD;
Merchant of Venice.&#xD;
Mr. Benjamin (but as everybody called him uncle Ben) Pea, re-&#xD;
sided two miles out of Dukesborough ; he was a small farmer---not&#xD;
small in person, but a farmer on a small scale. He raised consider-&#xD;
able corn, a trifle of cotton, great quantities of potatoes and some&#xD;
pinders. It was said that in. his younger days he used to be brisk in&#xD;
his business and to make something by hauling wood to town. He&#xD;
spent as little as he could and saved as much as he could ; but for a&#xD;
.certain purpose he kept as good an establishment as ho could. His&#xD;
little wagon used to be good enough to carry him and the old woman&#xD;
to town, yet he bought a second hand gig, and did other things in&#xD;
proportion. It was extravagant and he knew it, but he had a pur-&#xD;
pose: That purpose was to marry off his daughter Georgians. Now&#xD;
Georgiana had told him for years and years, even before the o1&#xD;
woman died, that if he wanted to marry her off (a thing she car'.&#xD;
nothing about herself) the only way to do that was for the family to&#xD;
go in a decent way. And now the old woman had died, and her&#xD;
father had grown old, she had her OWf way, and th'.t wns ns decent&#xD;
as could be afforded, a'nd no tnore.&#xD;
Miss Georgiana Pea was heavy ; heavy of being married off, and&#xD;
heavy of body; her weight for fifteen years at the least, had not&#xD;
been probably less than one hundred and seventy pounds. In her&#xD;
seasons of highest'health, which were probably oftoner.in the latter&#xD;
part of the fall than at any other period of the year, people used to&#xD;
guess that it might be even'more ; but there was no getting at it at&#xD;
any time, because she always stoutly refused to be weighed. True,&#xD;
she laced, but that did not seem to diminish her materially, for what&#xD;
was pressed down by the corsets managed to re-appear somewhere&#xD;
e158. She had a magnificent bust-this bust was her pride, that was&#xD;

evident. Indeed, she as good as confessed as much to me. I knew&#xD;
-   the family well ; she did'nt mind me-I was a very small boy, and&#xD;
she was aware that I considered that bust a wonderful work of&#xD;
nature.&#xD;
Yet she did'nt marry. The old.gentieman had been so anxious&#xD;
about it, that he had long ago rather given it out in a public way&#xD;
that upon-her marriage with his consent, (she was the only child-&#xD;
Peterson died when a boy, of measles) he should give up everything,&#xD;
houses, lands; etock furniture, and money, and live upon the bounty&#xD;
of his son-in-law. These several "items of property had been often&#xD;
appraised by the neighbors as accurately as could be done, (consider-&#xD;
ing that the exact amount of money could not be gotten at) in view&#xD;
of ascertaining for their own, satisfaction what her dowry might be.&#xD;
The, appraisement had gone through many gradations of figures, while&#xD;
the bridegroom delayed his coming. At the period of which I am&#xD;
now telling; there were those who maintained that uncle Ben way&#xD;
worth four thousand dollars ; others shook their heads and said&#xD;
thirty-five,.hundred ; while others yet, who' claimed to know more&#xD;
about it than any body else, they did'nt care who it was, insisted that&#xD;
three thousand was the outside. Many a man, it seemed to me, and&#xD;
one that would have been worth having, might have been caught by&#xD;
that bust and that prospective fortune. I remember that I was con-&#xD;
stantly expecting them to marry her off. But theyedid"not ; and now,&#xD;
at thirty, or thereabout, she was evidently of the opinion that even if&#xD;
she had many desires to enter intothe estate of marriage, their chances&#xD;
'of gratification were-few.' Indeed, Miss Pea was at that stage'when&#xD;
she was beginning to speak often of the other sex with disgust.&#xD;
Mr. Jacob Spouter resided in the very heart of'Dukesborough, and&#xD;
kept a hotel. The town being   mall, his business was small. He&#xD;
was a small man, but looked bright, capable and business like. To&#xD;
look at'hi b, you would have supposed that he kept a good hotel, but&#xD;
he did not, It is surprising, indeed, to consider how few mon there&#xD;
are who do. But this is a great theme and entirely independent of&#xD;
what I wish to tell, except so far as it may relate to the fact that Mr.&#xD;
Spouter had yet living with -him, an only child, ; daughter, whose&#xD;
name was Angeline. Miss Angeline, in short, took after the Panigans,&#xD;
who were long. She was a very thin young lady, almost too thin to&#xD;
look well, and her hair and complexion were rather sallow. But then&#xD;
that hair curled-every hair curled-&#xD;
Who has not a weakness? Miss Pea had hers, we saw; and now&#xD;
we shill see, as everybody for years had seen, that Miss Spouter had&#xD;
hers, also. It was an innocent one-it was her curls. In the memo-&#xD;
ry of man that hair had never been done up, but through all chat gee&#xD;
.of cir.umstances and weather, it had hung in curls, just as it hung on&#xD;
the day when this story begins. They had been complimented&#xD;
&#xD;
'U&#xD;
&#xD;
aUMOROtIS rTAjLE8&#xD;
&#xD;
thousands of times, and by hundreds of persons ; the guests of years&#xD;
had noticed them, and had uttered and smiled their approbation ; and&#xD;
there had been times when Miss. Spouter hoped, in spite of the want&#xD;
of other as striking charms, and in spite of the universally known fact&#xD;
that her father had always been insolvent and always would ae, that&#xD;
those curls would eventually entangle the person, without whom she&#xD;
felt that she never could be happy. While this person was a man, it&#xD;
was not any particular individual of the species. Many a time had&#xD;
she seen one who, she thought, would answer. She was not very&#xD;
fastidious, but she positively believed (and this belief made her appear&#xD;
to be anxious) that in view of all the circumstances of her life, the best&#xD;
thing that she could do for herself would be to marry ; besides, there&#xD;
was something in her, she thought, which she constantly understood,&#xD;
to be telling her that if she. had the opportunity, she could make some&#xD;
man extremely happy.&#xD;
But though those curls had been so often praised-yea, though&#xD;
they had beei sometimes handled-to such a degree did people's&#xD;
admiration, of them extend, that Miss Spouter, like her contemporary&#xD;
in the country, was unmarried, and beginning to try to feel as if she&#xD;
despised the vain and foolish world of man.&#xD;
These young ladies were friends and had been always. They&#xD;
were' so much attached that each seemed, to a superficial observer,&#xD;
to believe that she had been born for but one special purpose, and that&#xD;
was to help the other to get married ; for Miss Spouter believed and&#xD;
Miss Pea knew that marriage was a subject which, without intermis-&#xD;
sion, occupied the mind of her friend. It was pleasant to hear Miss&#xD;
Spouter, who was more sentimental and the j  r talker of the two,&#xD;
praise Miss Pea's biggerr,' by which terms side meant only her bust.&#xD;
No one ever dreamed that it was possible for any jealousy to rise be-&#xD;
tween them; for Miss Spouter had no figure worth mentioning, and&#xD;
not a hair of Miss Pea's head could be curled ; not only so, but the&#xD;
fact was, that in her heart of hearts. (so curious a thing is even the&#xD;
most constant friendship) neither thought much of the other's special&#xD;
accomplishment ; rather, each thought that there was entirely'too&#xD;
much of it, especially Miss Spouter touching'the biggerr.' If Miss Pea&#xD;
considered the property qualifination in her favor, Miss Spouter did&#xD;
not forget that she resided right in the very heart of Dukesborougb,&#xD;
and that her father kept a hotel. Now, as long asthe world stands,&#xD;
persons of their condition who live in town, will feel a little ahead&#xD;
of those who live in the, country ; while the latter, though never&#xD;
exactly knowing why, will admit that it is so. Miss Pea was gener-&#xD;
ally very much liked by the neighbors ; Miss Spouter had not made&#xD;
a great number of friends. Probably town airs had something to do&#xD;
in the matter.. Miss Pea was considered the superior character of&#xD;
the two, but neither of them thought so ; Miss Spouter, especially,&#xD;

who knew the meaning of many more woi'ds in the dictionary than&#xD;
her friend, and who had Tead Alonzo and Meli;4sa and the Three&#xD;
Spaniards, until she had the run of them fully, never dreamed' of&#xD;
suoh a thing..&#xD;
Miss Spouter was fond of visiting Miss Pea, is pecially in water-&#xD;
melon-time. Miss Pea valued the friendship of 1 iss Spouter because&#xD;
it afforded her, fregient opportunities of staying al a hotel, a privilege&#xD;
which she well knew not-many country girls enjoy i. To stay there,&#xD;
not as a boarder, but as a friend of the family :to eat there, and&#xD;
sleep there, and- not to pay for either of these di : tinctions as other&#xD;
people did, but to do these things on invitation ! Now, while Miss&#xD;
Pea got much better eating and sleeping at hom, iet she could but&#xD;
consider -the former as privileges. She never wo1 forget that once&#xD;
when there was a show in Dukesborough, given by a ventriloquist,&#xD;
who was also a juggler, she had been at Mr. J. Spouter's and had&#xD;
been introduced to the wonderful man' and his wife too, and had&#xD;
heard them talk about general matters just as other people did.&#xD;
But, time was waxing old. The bust had about ceased' to be&#xD;
ambitious, and the curls, though wishful yet, were failing into the&#xD;
habit of giving only despondent shakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IL~&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Spouter sat in the hotel parlor ; it was on the first flo9r and&#xD;
opened upon the street ; in it were two wooden rocking-chairs, six&#xD;
split-bottoms and a half round. I shall not undertake to describe&#xD;
the window-curtains. She was pensive and silent : the still summer&#xD;
evening disposed her to meditation. She sat silent and pensive, but&#xD;
not gloomy, Looking out from the window, she espied on the further&#xD;
side of the square, Miss Pea, who was in the act of turning towards&#xD;
her. here she came, in ood yellow calico and a green calash.  As&#xD;
the walked, her arms were crossed peacefully upon her chest.&#xD;
'Howdye, stranger!' saluted Miss' Spouter. They had not met in&#xD;
a fort ght.-&#xD;
'Stranger yourself,' answered Miss Pea, with a smile and a sigh.&#xD;
They embraced ; the curls fell upon the bust and the bust fostered&#xD;
the curls, a only long tried friends can fall upon and foster. Miss&#xD;
Pea came tQ stay all night ; never had they sept in the same house&#xD;
without sleeping together.&#xD;
'Well, Georgy,' Miss Spouter remarked, sweetly, but almost invid~&#xD;
idusl, as they were getting into bed, 'figger is figger'&#xD;
'It's no sioh a 'thing, answered Miss Fea, with firm self denialf&#xD;
1t's curls, you know it's curls.'&#xD;
No, George, its bigger.&#xD;

'Angeline Spouter, you know it aint; it curls, and you know its&#xD;
curls.&#xD;
They blew out the candle,and for a. short time continued this&#xD;
friendly discussion ; but soon Miss Pea got the best of it,, as usual,&#xD;
and Miss Spouter, by silence and other signs, admitted that it was&#xD;
curls,&#xD;
'We've been sleeping a long time together, G(eorge.'&#xD;
'We have that.&#xD;
'Ten years.'&#xD;
'Yes, fifteen of 'em.'&#xD;
'Gracious me! fifteen?'&#xD;
'Yes, indeed.'&#xD;
'Welt, but I was but a child then.'&#xD;
Miss Pea coughed. She was the elder by exactly six months.&#xD;
'Did we think tei years ago that ycu would now be a Pea and I a&#xD;
Spouter ?'&#xD;
'I did'nt think much about myself, but I had no idea you would.'&#xD;
Yet so it is; you with your bigger and yet a Pea.'&#xD;
'And what is worse, you with your curls and yet a Spouter.'&#xD;
'No,. not worse." You ought to have been married years ago,&#xD;
Georgiana Pea.'&#xD;
'If I had had your curls and had wanted to marry, J should a been&#xD;
married and forgot it.'&#xD;
- 'No, George, 'I never had the requisite figger.'&#xD;
a    'Angeline Spouter, do hush.'&#xD;
'Suppose we had married, George?'&#xD;
'Well.'&#xD;
'I think I could have made my husband love mc as few men have&#xD;
ever loved, be they whomsoever they might.'&#xD;
'A'h! every body knows that.'&#xD;
'No, alas I none but thee, George.'&#xD;
'Yes, but I know better.'&#xD;
Miss Spouter again gave it up.&#xD;
'Do you reckon we would have had families, George?'&#xD;
. Miss Pea smothering her head under her friend's pillow, declared&#xD;
that she could laugh fit to kill herself.'&#xD;
'I have often thought, my dear George, of what I would think if I&#xD;
had married, and had a little girl-'&#xD;
'With curly hair ?'&#xD;
'Well-yes; I should have had no objection, hit--I hopSe he&#xD;
would have been a good child, George.'&#xD;

'No doubt about that,' answered Miss Pea, with something of a&#xD;
yawn.'&#xD;
'8he should have loved you, Georgiana, and all yours.'&#xD;
'All mine ?' Miss Pea seemed to wake up.&#xD;
'Yes, all yours.'&#xD;
'Well, if I had been married, and if it had been my lot, I would'nt&#xD;
a wanted it to been but one, certain, sure.'&#xD;
'And that should have been Georgiana Pea, over and over again.'&#xD;
'Well, it should'nt; he--'&#xD;
'He? O, George, would you have. bad a boy? What a creature!'&#xD;
'Yes, I would, Angy, certain ; girls are a trouble.'&#xD;
'But girls are so much prettier, George,-la, me P&#xD;
'They may be prettier, but they are a trouble.'&#xD;
'He would have been a good child, teorgy.'&#xD;
'If-he had'nt I'd have made him good.' Miss Pea. poke with&#xD;
decision.&#xD;
'Oh, you cruel creature l'&#xD;
'No, I'm not cruel, Angeline, but J belive in making children mind.&#xD;
'So do I, but I can't see how-a woman can beat her own offspring&#xD;
to death.'" Miss Spouter was indignant.&#xD;
I doi't mean that; still--la, Angeline Spouter, what are we talking&#xD;
about? we have'nt got-any children, and as for me, I shall never&#xD;
have any myself, certain and sure.-!'&#xD;
Miss Pea laughed heartily, but Miss Spouter sighed, and remarked&#xD;
that it was not in people to say what was to be nor what was'nt&#xD;
to be.'&#xD;
'George, I do believe you are going tosleep.'&#xD;
Miss Pea declared that she was'nt, and like all'persons of her size,&#xD;
she thought she was telling the truth. Miss Spouter had one or two&#xD;
other remarks which she' always made on such occasions, and which&#xD;
she wanted to make now.'&#xD;
'Georgiana Pea, do you or do you not ever expect to marry ? I&#xD;
ask you candidly.'&#xD;
'No, Angeline, I don't; I may have had thoughts, I may have&#xD;
had expectations; pap looks as if he would go distracted if I don't&#xD;
marry, but to tell you the truth, I have about come to the conclusion&#xD;
that there's more marries now than does well, Pap declares that he&#xD;
means to marry me off to somebody before he dies. He thinks that&#xD;
I eould'nt take care of myself if he was to die, and that he takes&#xD;
care of me now himself. I think I'm the one that takes care of him,&#xD;
and I think I could take as good care of myself then as I do now.&#xD;
He says I shall marry though, and Pm waitin to see how it'll be.&#xD;
But I tell you, Angeline Spouter, that there's more marries now:&#xD;
than ever does well.'&#xD;

&#xD;
&amp;amp;And--well,' answered Miss Spouter, 'and so have I concluded&#xD;
about'it, It is the honest expression of the genuine sentiments of&#xD;
my innermost heart. What is man? A depeitful, vain and foolish&#xD;
creature, who will to-day talk his honey words, and praise a girl's&#xD;
curls, and to morrow, he is further off than when we first laid our&#xD;
eyes on him. What is your opinion of man, George? What now is&#xD;
your opinion of Totn Dyson, who used to melt before the sight of&#xD;
you like butter ere the sin had set?'&#xD;
'I think of Tom DysonI like I think of Barney Bolton who used to&#xD;
praise your curls just like they were sn much gold, and like I think&#xD;
of all of 'em, and that's about as much as I think of a old dead pine&#xD;
tree or post oak.'&#xD;
Miss Pea had not read many books like Miss Spouter, and must&#xD;
necessarily, therefore, borrow her comparisons from objects familiar&#xD;
to her country life. Miss Spouter noticed the difference, but re-&#xD;
frained from remarking on it.&#xD;
'And yet, Georgiana, there is something in me, I feel it ; it tells&#xD;
me that I could have made Barney Bolton much happier than, Ma-&#xD;
linda Jones has. Barney Bolton is not happy, Georgiana Pea.'&#xD;
Miss. Pea only coughed.&#xD;
Yes,.indeed ! Alas ! I see it in his eye ; I see it in his walk ; I&#xD;
see it in his every action. The image of Angeline Spouter is in hi&#xD;
breast and it will ,stay there forever.'&#xD;
Miss Pea was always perfectly silent, and endeavored to feel&#xD;
solemn when this last speech was said.&#xD;
'If you were to marry, George, I should be the lonesomest creator"&#xD;
in the wide, wide world.'&#xD;
'Ah, well ! when I marry, which is never going to be the case,&#xD;
(that is exceptin pap do go distracted and hunt me up a good chance)&#xD;
you'll .be married and' forget it, and that little curly . headed girl&#xD;
will be readin, ritin and cypherin.' Miss Pea yawned and laughed&#xD;
slightly.&#xD;
'Never, never ! But won't you let your little boy come sometimes&#xD;
in a passing hour to see a lonesome girl, who once was you friend,&#xD;
but now, alas!, abandoned ?',&#xD;
'Angeline, Spouter, do hush.&#xD;
*          * *     *     *     *    *        *   .&#xD;
'George, it is very warm to-nigh ; is it late ?'&#xD;
'I should think it was,' answered Miss Pea, and snored.&#xD;
Miss Spouter lay for some time awake, but silent. She then&#xD;
lifted the curtain from the window through which the moon, high&#xD;
in heaven, shone upon -the bed, withdrew from her cap five or six&#xD;
curls, extending them upon her snowy breast, smiled dismally, put&#xD;
them up again, looked a moment at her, companion, then abruptly&#xD;
tuned her back to her, and went to' sleep.&#xD;

But friendship, like other good things, has enemies: One of the&#xD;
most dangerous of these is a third person. These beings are among&#xD;
the most inconvenienf and troublesome upon earth. Not often do&#xD;
confidential conversations take place in a company of three, especial-&#xD;
ly conversations appertaining to friendship or love. When senti&#xD;
ments,'hot from, the heart, has to move in triangles, it trust often&#xD;
meet with hindrances and cool itself before it has reached its destina-&#xD;
tion. As in mathematics, between two points, so in social life&#xD;
between two hearts ; the shortest way is a straight line. A third&#xD;
person makes a divErgence and a delay. Third persons have done&#xD;
more to separate very friends and lovers, than all the world besides&#xD;
They had gotten between other persons before, and now, one of&#xD;
then had come to get between Miss Spouter and Miss Pea.&#xD;
Adiel Slack, some years before, had left his native Massachusetts,&#xD;
and from going to and fro upon the earth, came in 'an evil day, and&#xD;
put up at the inn of 'Jacob Spouter. He was tall, deep voiced, big&#xD;
footed, and the most deliberate looking man that had ever been in&#xD;
Dukesborough. He was one of those imperturbable Yankees that could&#xD;
fool you when you were watching him just as well as when you were&#xD;
not. When he said that he was twenty-eight his last birth-day, his&#xD;
fresh looking hair, his unwrinkled and unblushing cheek, and his&#xD;
patire freedom froi all signs of wear and care, made one believe&#xD;
that it must be so. If he had said that he was forty-five, the gravity&#xD;
of his countenance, the deliberation of his gait, and the deep, wordly&#xD;
wisdom of his eye would have made one believe that he spoke truly.&#xD;
The mere arrival of such a person in that small community, must&#xD;
'necessarily create some stir. lie was greatly the most remarkable&#xD;
one'of all the pay singers who came bythat morning's stage. While&#xD;
they ate their :breakfast with that haste which is pecliar to the&#xD;
traveling, public, he ;took his time. The stage went away and left&#xD;
'him at the table' eating his fifth biscuit, while Mrs. Spouter's eyes&#xD;
were fixed upon him with that steadfast look with which she was&#xD;
wont to regard all persons who ate at her table more than she thought&#xD;
was fairly He took another biscuit, looked about for more butter and&#xD;
attempted to open a convereation with that lady ; but she was not in&#xD;
the 1ood to be communicative, so he set to the work of studying&#xD;
he;. Ee made her out to be a woman- of a serious turn of mind,&#xD;
less attentive to dress than her husband, but at the same time aspir-&#xD;
ing and possibly with propriety and with success to be the head of&#xD;

the family. After breakfast, he stood about, sit about, picked his&#xD;
teeth, ('with a ivory lancet, blamed if it were'nt,' Mr. Spouter said)&#xD;
then took his hat an'd strolled about the villoge all the forenoon.&#xD;
He went into both the stores, got acquainted with the doctor and the&#xD;
black smith, and the shoemaker, found aid bargained for the rent of&#xD;
a room, and at dinner, announced himself a citizen of Georgia and a&#xD;
merchant -f Dukesborough. In less than a week, a smallfstock of&#xD;
'goods had arrived and were neatly arranged in the room, over the&#xD;
d1o4t of which, hung a sign board, painted by himself, which made&#xD;
Mr.. Boggs and-Messrs. Bland nand Jones wish either that they had&#xD;
never had sign boards, or that Adiel Slack, dry goods merchant, had&#xD;
- never come here.&#xD;
Being a single man, Mr. Slack boarded at the hotel of J. Spouter.&#xD;
Now,. no sooner was it settled that he was to become a citizen than&#xD;
Miss Spouter, according to ancient usage in such cases, felt herself&#xD;
,to be yielding to the insmious influences of yet another love. Who&#xD;
know, she thought, that the fond dream of her life was not des-&#xD;
tined new to become a blit ;'l consummation. The fact that Mr.&#xD;
Slack had come from afar,    her sentimental soul only the more&#xD;
hopeful. How this was so d1u could not tell, but it was so, and the&#xD;
good girl began at once to . estow the most assiduous cultivation&#xD;
upon every charm which sli ti.,ught she possessed. 'NMr. Slack soon&#xD;
began to be treated with inoi consideration than any of the board-&#xD;
ers. He had within a week joved from Mr. Spouter's end of the&#xD;
table up to Mrs. Spouter's, ant become, as it were, that lady's left&#xD;
bower, Miss Angeline being, of course, her right. The hot biscuit&#xD;
were always handed first to him, and if anybody got a hot waffle, it&#xD;
was he. People used to look up towards Mrs. Spouter and get oo-&#xD;
casional glimpses of little plates of fresh butter and pi'eserves that&#xD;
tried to hide behind the castors or the candlestick. When there was&#xD;
pie,' Mr. Slack was helped first, because, among other things, he was&#xD;
the more sure of getting another piece, if the pie, as it sometimes&#xD;
would , happen, in spite of precaution, should not go around the&#xD;
second time.&#xD;
The servants did not like him because he never gave them a kind&#xD;
word nor a cent of money. But let any one of them omit to hand&#xD;
the best things to him  rst. o,. the partiality that was shown as&#xD;
plain as day to that man! Every body saw it, and spoke of it&#xD;
among confidential friends. Some said it was a sin; some said it&#xD;
was a shame, and some went so far as to say it was both.&#xD;
Among the boarders, was one whom we have seen before. For&#xD;
Mr. Bill Williams had now been installed in his office, and had&#xD;
already began to take now responsibilities. When this conduct&#xD;
towards the new comer had become notorious, he was heard by&#xD;
many persons even to swear that she'd be dinged ef he- had had a hot&#xD;

waffle, even when thar was waffles, sense that dadblasted Yankee had&#xD;
moved up to old Miss Spouter's eend. As for the second piece of&#xD;
pie, he had done gin out ever hearin of the like any mor throout the&#xD;
ages of . sorrowful and ontimely world.' He spoke with feeling it&#xD;
is true ; but he,was a clerk in Mr. Bland's store, and he thought&#xD;
that'ifhe could not take some responsibility, the question was who&#xD;
could. 'Consequenses mount be consequences,' said Mr. Bill, "be they&#xD;
now or at some futer day. I takes the responsibility to say that, the&#xD;
ease ar a onfair, and a imposition on the boarders and on the tran.&#xD;
shent people, and it war also a shaihe on. Dukesborough, and also&#xD;
---,' Mr. Bill shook his head for the conclusion.&#xD;
But in spite of every body and every thing, Mr. Slack kept his&#xD;
place. He soon discovered Miss Spouter's weakness and her pas-&#xD;
sion. Flattering as it might be to find himself the favored object of&#xD;
her pursuit, yet the reflection that her only capital was a head of&#xD;
curls, which in time would fade, caused him to determine, after making&#xD;
his calculations, that no profit was to be netted in being caught. It&#xD;
was not to be overlooked, however, that , there would be, if not an&#xD;
entire saving of expense, at least a postponement of its payment in'&#xD;
keeping his thoughts to himself and in seeming to be drawing nearer&#xD;
and nearer the vortex which was ready to swallow him up. The&#xD;
terms of board at Mr. Spouter's included monthly payments. These&#xD;
did not suit calculations which were made upon the principle of col-&#xD;
lecting his own dues at once and postponing his payments as'long,&#xD;
as possible, and if possible, to the end of time. Now, he guessed&#xD;
that great as were Mr. Spouter's needs, that affectionate father would&#xD;
not be the man to' run the risk of driying off his daughter's. suitor&#xD;
by worrying him'with dues for a little item of board, which might all&#xD;
come back again into the family. In addition to this, he was not&#xD;
insensible to the advantage of maintaining his seat at the dinner&#xD;
table; where biscuits, waffles and pies, when they came at all, were&#xD;
wont to make their first appearance. These several matters, being&#xD;
actual money to him, were ,not to be overlooked by a man w ho did&#xD;
nothing without deliberation..; After deliberating, therefore, he de-&#xD;
termined to so conduct himself before the' -Spouters'as to create the&#xD;
hope' that the time would 'come when he would solicit the hand of'&#xD;
her who long had been willingto bestow it upon somebody. But&#xD;
he was careful to keep his own advances and his meetings of ad-&#xD;
vanbes without the pale of such contingences as he had named were,&#xD;
in the South, accustomed to follow breaches of marriage contracts.&#xD;
He maintained his place at the table, and took what it afforded, in&#xD;
the manner of a man who was very near to being one of the family.&#xD;
He chatted in a very familiar manner with Mrs. Spouter, and sym.&#xD;
pathised with her and Mr. Spouter's. complaints of the high price of&#xD;
everything except board, He lounged in the parlor, where he told&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;

&#xD;
to Miss Angeline touching stories of his boyhood's home. He be-&#xD;
stowed due admiration upon those curls which, every time he saw&#xD;
them, reminded him of a portrait of his mother, (row a saint in&#xD;
heaven), taken when she was a girl eighteen years old. Then he&#xD;
spoke feelingly of how he had been a wanderer, and how he began&#xD;
to think it was time he had settled himself for good ; how he had&#xD;
never felt exactly ready for that until since he had come to Dukes-&#xD;
borough, and that-and that---and that---- embarrassment would&#xD;
prevent him from saying more. But whenever he got to this point,&#xD;
and Miss Angeline's heart would be about to burst, and she- would&#xD;
be getting ready to cast herself upon his faithful boson, he would&#xD;
change abruptly, become frightened, go-away and stay away for a',&#xD;
week.&#xD;
'At their first meeting at the breakfast table after such scenes,&#xD;
Miss Spouter would appear quite conscious, hold herself yet straight-&#xD;
er and endeavor to show that she had spirit. But before she had&#xD;
carried it far, she would conclude to stop where she was, go back and&#xD;
begin again.-&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
But while these things were going on among the Spouters, what&#xD;
had become of the Peas? who ever supposes that Miss Georgiana&#xD;
was buried irn the country, dead or alive,'is simply mistaken. When&#xD;
she heard that there was a new store in town, she wanted to see it ;&#xD;
and when uncle Ben heard that it was kept by a bachelor, he was&#xD;
determined that he should see his daughter ; for as he 'grew older,&#xD;
his, anxiety became more intense for Georgiana to find some body,&#xD;
as he.expressed it, 'to take keer of her when my head gits cold.'&#xD;
He begged her several times to go before she was ready.&#xD;
'Georgy, put on'your y aller caliker and go long.'&#xD;
'Pap, do wait till I get ready. I do believe you will go distracted.'&#xD;
Georgiana waited until she got ready, and when she did get ready&#xD;
she went. Her plan. was to go and spend the night with Miss&#xD;
Spouter, and in company with her visit the new store the next&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
Some persons believe in presentiments, and some do not. I&#xD;
hardly know what to think of. such things, and have never yet made&#xD;
up my mind whether they are reliable or not. Sometimes they seem&#xD;
to foreshadow coming events, and sometimes they are clearly at&#xD;
fault. I have occasionally had dro   , and subsequent events&#xD;
were in such exact accordance with thaut that I have been inclined&#xD;
to accord to them much of the itnportanee that by some persons it&#xD;
is maintained they have. Then, again, t' e reams I have had (for I&#xD;
have always been a dreamer) hive bey .   entirely unreasonable,&#xD;

nay, absurd, and ,even tridieulous, as' to be impos ible of fulfillment.&#xD;
For intanee, I have more than once dreamed that I was.a woman,&#xD;
and I have since been much amused by the recollection of so'e of&#xD;
the silly thingsthat I did -and said while in that estate. I do not&#xD;
consider this an opportune place to mention them, even if they were&#xD;
worthy of mention ,on any occasion, and I allude to them for the&#xD;
purpose of satyig that after such dreams I have bean disposed to&#xD;
reject the whole of' the theory of dreams.&#xD;
But all this is neither here nor there. The divergence from my&#xD;
tory, thourhnatural, cannot with propriety be farther extended,&#xD;
and will return at once to m'r two heroines in whose deportment&#xD;
iinmediately subsequent to what was last being done by them both,&#xD;
will be found the reason' why such divergence was made.&#xD;
o sooner had Miss Spouter determined fully in her mind that she&#xD;
would catch Mr. Slack if she could, than she was conscious of..a&#xD;
wavering in her friendship for Miss Pea ; for she felt that that&#xD;
person was destined to be the greatest, if not the only barrier between&#xD;
er and the objeet of her pursuit. 'She, Miss Spotter, had seen him&#xD;
first slh thought. She had, as it were, found him, and when George&#xD;
was noteven looking for any such property. George did not have&#xD;
even a shadow of the remotest claim to him. It was wrongsand un-&#xD;
in  in George to iuterfere. She, Miss Spouter, wouldn't .have&#xD;
treated her so. Now 'all this was before Miss Pea had ever laid&#xD;
eyes on'Nr. Slack, and Miss Spouter knew it. That made no direr-&#xD;
ence, she said to herself, if anything, it made it worse. She was&#xD;
huit and she could not help it.&#xD;
Miss Pea might have had a presentiment of this state of things,&#xD;
antd shemight not. But at all events, when she went upon her&#xD;
visit, she carried a bucket of butter as a present to Mrs. Spou ter.&#xD;
It wasjust before supper time, and consequently tooalate for her to&#xD;
return that evening. If it had not been, as she afterwards declared&#xD;
upon her word and honor, she; would have done so. The Spouters&#xD;
were as cold as ice.' Not even the bucket of butter could warm Mrs,&#xD;
Spouter a single degree. Strange conduct for her. Miss Angeline&#xD;
at first thought that she would not goin to the supper table.. But&#xD;
then that would be too plain,and upon reflection, she thu  t 'she&#xD;
preferred to be there.           -&#xD;
Miss Pea and Mr. Slack, of course, had to be" introduced. He&#xD;
found her disposed to be chatty. Miss'Spouter looked very grave;&#xD;
and raised her pocket handkerchief to her mouth, as an occasional&#xD;
provincialism- fell from the lips of' her country visitress, while her&#xD;
dear mother, taking the cue, would glance slyly at Mr. Slack and&#xD;
sniker.1-&#xD;
'This is oncommon good butter, Mrs. Spouter,' he remarked to the&#xD;

lady of the house; and oh, the quantities of butter that plan did&#xD;
consume !&#xD;
Now, it was from Miss Pea's bucket ; they did not like to confess&#xD;
it, but they had it to do..&#xD;
'Ait ?  Oh! well, Miss Pea's mother must be a noble housekeeper.'&#xD;
Mrs. Pea had been dead several years,&#xD;
'Is it possible ?  You, then"!'&#xD;
.Miss Georgiana would have told a lie if she had not acknowledged&#xD;
that it was.&#xD;
Mr. Slack bestowed a look of intense admiration upon her whicn&#xD;
made Miss Spouter become quite grave, and her mother somewhat&#xD;
angry..&#xD;
After supper the gentleman followed the ladies into the parlor.&#xD;
Miss Spouter was pensive, and complained 'of head-ache. Miss Pea&#xD;
dd ot believe she had it, and therefore she spoke freely of her&#xD;
father's plantation, of what he was to her and she to him, and of how&#xD;
he was always uring her to get married, a thing which she had&#xD;
made up her mind never to (do. When they retired for the night,&#xD;
Miss Spouter being no better, but rather worse, they did what they&#xD;
had never done in their lives before, they slept apart. This was&#xD;
capping the climax, and Miss Pea went home thi next morning,&#xD;
asking herself many times on the way, if friendship was anything&#xD;
but a name.""&#xD;
It seenmad to be a sad thing that these youngladies should part.&#xD;
Hand in hand they had traveled the broad road of life, and never&#xD;
jostled each other when men were plentiful. But these animals had&#xD;
broken from thept like so many wil4 cattle, some dodging and dart-&#xD;
ing between them, some taking to by-paths, and some wildly leaping&#xD;
over precipices, until now they were drawing nigh to the road of&#xD;
young womanhood, and there was but one left for them both. If&#xD;
they could have divided him it might have been well ; but he was&#xD;
indivisible. The fact is, Mr. Slack ought never to have come there,&#xD;
or he ought to have brought his twin brother with him.&#xD;
'What's become of your friend ?' he inquired at breakfast.&#xD;
'She's gone to look after what she calls her father's plantation, I&#xD;
reckon,' answered Mrs. Spouter, sharply.&#xD;
'Haint her father got any plantation, then?'&#xD;
le's got a little bit of two hundred acres of tolerably poor land.&#xD;
That's all the plantation he's got.&#xD;
'Oh, nia!' interceded Miss Angeline, 'Georgiana is a very good girl.'&#xD;
'She may be good, but if you call her a gi. I don't know what you&#xD;
would call them that's fifteen or twenty yeai y' nger ; in fm h&#xD;
was young that wouldn't make her daddy rich,.'rl&#xD;
'Oh, ne But, oh, ma I' Miss Spouter persisted in a general way,&#xD;
fgr she seemed to think that this was all that could be- said in her&#xD;

&#xD;
favor. Upon reflection she asked Mr. Slack if he did not think Miss&#xD;
Pea had a good figger. Then she took a very small sip of water,&#xD;
wiped her mouth carefully and coughed slightly.  1&#xD;
'Wall, I--ah,' began Mr. Slack, but ma laughed so immoderately&#xD;
that he laughed too, and did not finish giving his opinion in words.&#xD;
Alas, for Miss Pea! Big as she was, she was cut all to pieces and&#xD;
salted away by Mrs. Spouter, while Miss Angeline could only look&#xD;
.a little reproachfully now and then, and say 'Oh, ma!'&#xD;
*     *     * - e,     * -        *     *    )4   -*&#xD;
'Two hundred acres,' mused Mr. Slack on his bed that night. In&#xD;
Massachusetts that is a considerable farm; other property in propor-&#xD;
tion. What would it bring in ready money if the old gentleman (he&#xD;
is old, certain) should take a notion to gjve it up now ; already some&#xD;
money. 'e brought me a fine watermelon this morning, and asked&#xD;
me to go out and see them all. I'm a going. Quick work, Adiel;&#xD;
quick work,'&#xD;
Mr. Slack was a hard man to catch ; it bad been tried before and&#xD;
had failed. Nevertheless, Mrs Spouter and Miss Spouter, about&#xD;
six weeks later, actually caught him in the act of coming' away&#xD;
from Mr. Pea's- What made it worse, he had a bunch of pinks in&#xD;
his hand. The next time Miss Spouter met Miss Pea, she did not&#xD;
speak to her. She-only shook her curls and said to herself in words&#xD;
which were audible, 'such is life.' Georgiana folded her hands over&#xD;
her bosom and asked, if friendship was not a name, what wastit?&#xD;
But the man maintained his place at the table, to which he march-&#xD;
ed with-utiqsual confidence and good humor at the first meal after&#xD;
his detection:; what is more, the little plates maintained 'their places.&#xD;
In spite of all his goings to the Pea's and his returning with bunches&#xD;
of pinks in his hands, his deportment in any other respect, had not,&#xD;
at least for the worst, changed, Indeed, he looked oftener and&#xD;
more proudly, at they curls. Yes, thought Miss Spouter, he n ay&#xD;
marry her, but the image of Angeline Spouter is in his breast, and&#xD;
it will stay there forever. * But for her entreaties her ma would have&#xD;
removed the little plates and sent him back to the other end of the&#xD;
table, where he came from.&#xD;
. I'm jest the woman to do it,' she said. 'That long-legged Yan-&#xD;
kee has eat more than his worth in butter alone, The house '1l&#xD;
break or be eat up, it makes no difference which, and nary cent of.&#xD;
money has he paid yit. Settle himself, indeed! He'll never, settle&#xD;
his .nasty self excipt whar thar's money, or everlastin butter, and&#xD;
he not' to pay for it neither. And.I'll move them plates to-morrow&#xD;
mornin, if I don't you may--'&#xD;
'Oh, ma! he DON'T love her, I know he don't. Let them stay a&#xD;
while longer.'&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
And the next morning the little plates would come in, take their&#xD;
places and look as cheerful as if nothing had happened.&#xD;
Mr. Slack did a cash business. Time rolled on ; the faster it&#xD;
rolled the cheaper he sold. His stock dwindled, and everybody&#xD;
asked why it was not being replenished. It began to he rumored&#xD;
that he was going to buy a plantation and settle himself. The ru-&#xD;
mor was traced to uncle Ben Pea, Miss Goorgiana. was asked&#xD;
about it and became confused.&#xD;
'She jist as well a give it up,' said Mr. Bill Williams, at Mr.&#xD;
Spouter's table. Mr. Bill was gradually edging up towards 'quality&#xD;
eend' as he termed the head. 'In fac, she did give it up fairly. I&#xD;
axed her a plain question ; she couldn't say nothing, and she didn't.&#xD;
She merrily hung her head upon her bros, and she seem monsous&#xD;
comfortubble. She ar evidenly scogitatin on the blessed joys of a&#xD;
futur state.'&#xD;
The next morning, th   " tie plates were absent, and Mr. Slack,&#xD;
without, seeming to not   hat Mr. Bill Williams had usurped his&#xD;
place, took his seat by \ pouterr aid alled with him in the man-&#xD;
ner of a man who hE     ea on a journey of some weeks and had&#xD;
now returned. That ge ,nman did not seem to be at all congratu-&#xD;
latory on the occasion, but immediately after breakfast brought&#xD;
within view of his guest an amount for three; months' board. The&#xD;
latter looked over it carefully , remarked that he thought it-was cor-&#xD;
rect, begged that it m'ght be considered as cash, and walked away.&#xD;
This was an eventful day to Mr. Slack, for besides the aforemen-&#xD;
tjoned incident, he sold out the remainder or his stock to Messrs.&#xD;
Bland and Jones, went without his dinner, borrowed a. gig from the&#xD;
Justice of the Peace, took him along with him to Mr- Pea's, where,&#xD;
at three o'clock P. M. he was married to Miss Georgiana.&#xD;
'Wretched creature I' exclaimed Angelisa, the forsaken, when&#xD;
her mother informed her of the news at night  At first she thought&#xD;
she would faint; but she did not. She retired to her room, undres-&#xD;
ed, looked at her curls in the glass, even longer than was her wont,&#xD;
put them away tenderly, got into bed, apostrophised property and&#xD;
the other sordid things of this world, and went to sleep with this&#xD;
thought upon her mind : 'Georgiana Pea may be by his side, but&#xD;
the image of Angeline Spoutei is in his breast, and it will stay there&#xD;
forever&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
"Are we not one? Are we not joined by Heavenite&#xD;

Georgiana was married and her father was satisfied. It was what&#xD;
he had wished a long time. The danger otL going di tracted was&#xD;

over. He would have preferred a Southern man, it is true, but all&#xD;
of that class had discovered such a want to appeciate his Georgy&#xD;
that he persuaded himself that she had made a narrow escape in not&#xD;
marrying one of them. Mr. Slack had some ways of -doing and talk-&#xD;
ing that he did not quite understand ; but ho elieved that they&#xD;
would wear off. Georgy now had a husband to take care of her&#xD;
when his head got cold, and that war enough. She did not seem&#xD;
to be perfectly happy, but, on the contrary, somewhat ill at ease.&#xD;
BRut then she wasn't any young thing to. let getting married run her&#xD;
raving distracted. He liked Mr. Slack upon the whole ; he suited&#xD;
him well enough, and that is what parents generally care mostly&#xD;
for. 'He was  business man, that's what he was. He talked upon&#xD;
business even on the afternoon of his marriage, and renewed the&#xD;
subject after supper and the next morning. One would have thought,&#xD;
to hear hith1 talk about business, tha tl.e honey moon had shone out&#xD;
and gone down long ago. It did  -t look exactly right ; but now,&#xD;
that Mr. Slack was a married mi. he was for making something.&#xD;
If he owned the farm;,he should du this thing and that thing, sell&#xD;
this piece of property and convert it ito cash ; in short, he should&#xD;
sell out the whole concern and go where land was cheaper and bet-&#xD;
ter. If it were-left to him he should turn it over, so that in twelve&#xD;
months it should be worth at lear.t wice as much as it was now. It&#xD;
was very clear to uncle Ben that his son-in-law was a business man';&#xD;
still, he did not make out tha title deeds. Notwithstanding his&#xD;
hints to that effect heretofore, he had never entertained the slightest&#xD;
notion of such .a thing. When Mr. Slack persisted in saying what&#xD;
he should do if he were the owner, the old gentleman took occasion&#xD;
to say,. but in a somewhat jocose way, that he and Georgy would&#xD;
have to wait for that until his head got cold, which, he said by way&#xD;
of consoling for the disappointment, wouldn't be much longer, This&#xD;
was only a day or two after the marriage. Mr. Slack seemed to be&#xD;
somewhat hurt, but he merely remarked that hi bad a plenty to live&#xD;
on, and that all he wanted with property was for Georgiana to enjoy&#xD;
it. He had money enough to buy a tract of land adjoifing Mr. Pea's&#xD;
and two or three fellows. If Georgiana had a good house woman it&#xD;
would save her from a good deal of work which now, since she was&#xD;
his 'wife, he would rather she didn't have to do - but-ah-he sup-&#xD;
posed he should have to wait for that.&#xD;
Yes, but he needn't to do any such thing, Mr. Pea stoutly main-&#xD;
tained. Those being Mr. Slack's .intentions the 'oman should be&#xD;
bought. The money was therein that side-board drawer whenever&#xD;
they found one to suit them. He should buy the. 'oman himself.&#xD;
The son-i1-law's countenance brightened a little.: He might have to&#xD;
go to Augusta in a few days ; the likeliest gangs were ,there gen-&#xD;
erally, and it might suit just as well to take the 'money along with&#xD;
&#xD;
him and buy the woman there. Georgiana didn't say anything ; but&#xD;
la me, what did she know about business?&#xD;
Mr. Slack sent into the village every day for the mail, for Dukes-&#xD;
borough being immediately on the great line of travel, had its daily&#xD;
mail. He had been married less than a week, when, one morning&#xD;
a letter was brought to him which made him turn a little pale.&#xD;
Upon his father-in-law's inquiry from whence it came, he answered&#xD;
after a'moment's hesitation, that it was from a man who owed him&#xD;
some money, and who had written to say that if he would meet him&#xD;
the next day in Augusta, he would pay him a hundred dollars and&#xD;
renew the note. A hundred dollars indeed ! The rascal had prom-&#xD;
ised to pay half the note, and now as he was about settling himself&#xD;
he was to be put off with a hundred dollars. He had a good mind&#xD;
not to go and would not but for the importance of having the note&#xD;
renewed. But could he get there in time? How was that Mr. Pea ?&#xD;
Why, it was easy enough ; the stage would pass in a couple of hours,&#xD;
and as it traveled all night,-he could reach Augusta by nine o'clock&#xD;
the next morning. Mr. Slack hesitated. He was loth to go so soon&#xD;
after b6ing married, but as he had expected to go in a few'days any&#xD;
how, he guessed he had as well to go on at once, especially as no-&#xD;
groes seemed to berising in price, and it was important to get the&#xD;
woman as soon as . possible. Certainly business was business, if&#xD;
people were married. Mr. Slack ought to go at once ; he should if it&#xD;
was him.&#xD;
'Uncle Ben took out the money,. and Georgiana ordered lunch.&#xD;
Mr. Slack had so often complained of the old gentleman's time piece,&#xD;
that the latter, upon his entreaties to be allowed to take it with him,&#xD;
for repairs (at no expense to the owner of course) consented. TI.he&#xD;
man of business then went to packing his trunk and satchel. " Al-&#xD;
though he was to stay but three -days at furthest, yet, riot knowing&#xD;
but that he might need them, he packed in all his clothes, looking&#xD;
about all over the house to be sure that he had not niislaid anything.&#xD;
It was a nice lunch. It ought to have been, for it took a long&#xD;
time to be gotten ready. Mr. Slack was not sure that he was going&#xD;
.to get his supper, and ho therefore determined to put away enough&#xD;
to last him to the end of his journey. He had barely finished when&#xD;
the servant, who had been stationed to watch for the stage, announc-&#xD;
ed that it was coning. He bade both an affectionate adieu, looked&#xD;
inio the stage to see if there was any person in it whom he knew,&#xD;
didn't seem to be disappointed that there was not, hopped in, and&#xD;
off he went.&#xD;
Far from pining on'account of the absence of her mate, Georgiana.&#xD;
sensible woman that she was, went about her work as cheerfully as&#xD;
if nothing had ha pened. She had been so taken up with Ur. Slack&#xD;
that several small domestic rmaeters needed to be put to rights again,&#xD;

and she seemed to be even glad of the opportunity to look after them.. She ac-&#xD;
tualiy sang at her work-she was a good singer, too. The Peis always had&#xD;
been ; I knew the family we'l. She wasn't going to fret herself to dea'h, cer-;&#xD;
tain and sure. So she resumed her old tasks and habits, moved things back to&#xD;
their old places,,aud, in every respect, did as if she had forgotten that she had&#xD;
ever been married.&#xD;
Uncle Ben was glad to see her in such gay spirits. ]E knew what it was all&#xD;
for, and he laughed inwardly atid became gay himself. It was that nigger&#xD;
'oman. The old man counted ten days and nights. As much as he wanted to&#xD;
see Mr. Slack, he wanted yet more to see his watch ; without it he felt like a&#xD;
man without a newly ampu ated leg.  Bat that, he would not allow to trouble&#xD;
him very much. He talked a great deal, especially at meal times about his&#xD;
Georgy's prospects, joked her about many things, talked of the prospects agam&#xD;
and what he and Mr. Slack were going to do to make her the happiest woman&#xD;
in the world. Georgiana never suggested any change of their plans, and looked&#xD;
as if she intended to be but clay in their hands.&#xD;
Three days passed. Mr. Slack's very longest time was out. The stage hove&#xD;
in view ; Mr. Pea was at his gate, his hat was in his hand.&#xD;
'Good mornin, uncle Ben,' said the driver, and was passing on.&#xD;
Hello r hello, Thompson,' shouted the old man. Tliompson drew up.&#xD;
'Haint you got Mr. Slack aboard?'&#xD;
'No, SIR 1'&#xD;
'Haint you got a nigger 'oman?'&#xD;
'No, sir.'&#xD;
'Whar's Mr. Slack?'-&#xD;
'I don't knoww'&#xD;
'Naint you seed him ?'&#xD;
'No,.sir,'&#xD;
'Haint you hearn of him?'&#xD;
'No, sir.'&#xD;
'Why, what upon yearlh does it mean?'&#xD;
'Mr. Slack didn't go to nary tavern, but got off at a privit 'ouse way up town.&#xD;
I haint seed him nor heern from him sence. Was he to get back to-night.?'&#xD;
'Why, yes, certain and sure without fail.'"&#xD;
'Well, he paint here, certin. Good evenin.'&#xD;
Efe haint' come, Georgy,' said uncle Ben, as he went into the house,&#xD;
'Hasn't he?'&#xD;
'Why, no, ha baint''&#xD;

&#xD;
Unble Ben was too much occupied with his own disappointment to observe&#xD;
the equanimity with which Georgy bore her's. It was now bed time; the&#xD;
daughter went to her room, the father sat up at least half an hour longer than&#xD;
usual. HE was disappointed, certain and sure. When people told people they&#xD;
were coming at a certain time, he wanted 'em to come ; especially when they&#xD;
had people's watches. Oh, how he had missed it ! If he had missed it by day&#xD;
he had missed it as much by night. It used to hang by a nail over his bed, and&#xD;
be longed for the gentle lullaby of its tjckings. He had to go to bed, of course,&#xD;
but he lay awale another half an hour. A dreadful thought came: What if&#xD;
Mr. Slack, after all, was an IMPOSTERER ! Oh, he couldn't bear it. So he&#xD;
turned over and went to sleep ; but it wouldn't stay behind, it crawled over and&#xD;
came close to him in his sleep, and he dreamed that he was the owner of a&#xD;
jeweler's shop, and that while he had no power to move, thieves were breaking&#xD;
through and stealing.&#xD;
The next morning, immediately after breakfast, uncle Ben stood at his gate.&#xD;
He had a notion that Mr. Slack was coming in a private conveyance. Sure&#xD;
enough, yonder came a gig with a man in it and a horse behind with some-&#xD;
thing on the horse. Uncle Ben's eyes were dim, and ho couldn't make it out;&#xD;
but he hoped and believed that it was a nigger 'oman. Vain hope and vain&#xD;
belief! The gig carried Mr. Triplet, the deputy Sheriff, and the horse bore&#xD;
Mr. Pocket, a young lawyer from town. Uncle Bon had no business with&#xD;
them, certain and sure; so he bade them a good morning, as they came up,&#xD;
and again turned his eyes up the road. But the gentlemen stopped, and&#xD;
inquired if Mr. Slack was at home, No, but Mr. Pea looked for him every&#xD;
instant.. He had been gone to Augusty'three days, and was to a'been back&#xD;
last night, but he didn't.&#xD;
Mr. Triplet looked upon Mr. Pocket and smiled ; Mr. Pocket looked upon&#xD;
Triplet, but did not smile.&#xD;
'You must follow him.'&#xD;
'There must some foller him that kin run faster than I kin.' answered Mr.&#xD;
Triplet.&#xD;
'Foller who?' asked Mr. Pea.&#xD;
'Mr. Slack.'&#xD;
'Why he'll be here to-night. Or I'll be bound he's in a private conveyance,&#xD;
and'11 be here this mornin, In cose he's coming back; because he's got four&#xD;
hundred dollars of my money to buy a nigger 'oman with, and my watch be-&#xD;
sides. In cose he's coming back.'&#xD;
Mr. Triplet looked upon $r. Pea and smiled compassinately. Mr. Pea&#xD;
looked upon Mr. Triplet and frowned threatningly.&#xD;

What's the matter, Jim Trilet ?,&#xD;
'he matter ar, that you won't see your four hundred dollars agire nor our&#xD;
watch, nor the gentleman what carried 'em off.'&#xD;
'Why, what upon yearth is you talking about?'&#xD;
I ar talking about the business of my office, which ar to arrest Mr. Adial&#xD;
Slack, or Mr. Elisha Lovejoy, or Mr. Ejhraim Ilamlin, or what mouth be the&#xD;
name of the gentleman that carried off your four hundred dollars and your&#xD;
watch.'&#xD;
'Don't kick before you're spurred, Triplet, becase nobody aint accused him&#xD;
of takin the money and watch-leastways of stealin it. Mr. Slack is a honest&#xD;
man and my son-in-law, and I tell you he'll be- back to-night; and I look for&#xD;
him every minit of the day.''&#xD;
So nuch the better for us if he do come. I has not come to arrest hin for&#xD;
taking of the money and the watch, which is misdemeanors that I didn't&#xD;
know of tell now. But he is charge of obtainin credit by false pretensions of&#xD;
sealin divers money, of trading with niggers, and finally, with marryin three&#xD;
swimming, and not waitin for nary oneof 'erm to die fust.'&#xD;
'Oh, Lordyl' exclaimed Mr. Pea: He then approached the sheriff and in&#xD;
a tone which invited candor and confidence, and even hinted at gratitude, said,&#xD;
'Jeems Triplet, I voted for you,.you know I did ; I always has. Ar what&#xD;
you say a fac ?'&#xD;
I know you did, uncle Ben, and I tell you the plain truth, it ar a fac-&#xD;
'hay;alit no doubt about it. Mr. Pucket here can tell you all about it.'&#xD;
Mr. Pea, without waiting to hear further, turned and got into the house as&#xD;
fast as he would. lie went mito a shed room with uncommon desperation for&#xD;
a man of his years, and raised his hands in order to take down a shot gun&#xD;
from tvo,forks on which it used to hang. Tli forks were there, but the gun&#xD;
Waa gone   He looked at the forks with the most resentful astonishment, and&#xD;
with a voice towering with passion, asked them what in the name of thunder&#xD;
had become of his gun? Not receiving ,any answer, he put the same inter-&#xD;
rogatory to the corner behind the door, to the space under the bed, and even&#xD;
to two small glass drawers, after opening and shutting them with great vi&#xD;
lence. sue then ran back to the front.door and questioned the whole universe&#xD;
on the suibject.-&#xD;
'Roa    ! ROBBED 1!' roared the old man. 'Gen-tul-men, cf I paint robbed,&#xD;
.  Mr. Pea had not 'cussed' before (as he afterwards declared upon his&#xD;
word and honor) in twenty years.                       a&#xD;

HUMOROUS TALES.&#xD;
&#xD;
Georgiana had been at the dairy, superintendimg her butter. She had seen&#xD;
the men as they came, had gone into the house as quietly as she could and&#xD;
was peeping and listening through the wimdw of her own room.&#xD;
'Pap,' she said; not loudly, hut earnestly, (o( come here, if you please.'&#xD;
He went into her room.&#xD;
I reckon now you're satisfied. He's go1 what lie cane here for; lhe's stole&#xD;
from you, and lie's stole from me ; I haint a pocket handkerchieffto my name.&#xD;
But do, for goodness' sake, go and send them men away.'&#xD;
'Oh, Lordyt!' reiteratedl Mr. Pea, retiring. 'Gentnlucn, its no use, wo&#xD;
are cotcht; (Georgy and me has both been cotehit-I acknowledge the corn ,&#xD;
and what is worser, it seem that I am the cause of it all. IIe have took my&#xD;
money, he have 1ook my watch, he have took my gun, anid da-ing his low&#xD;
life skin, he have even took Georgy's pocket handkerciefs. It seem like he&#xD;
jest picked me and Georgy out for all his rascalities. And to think that I&#xD;
should be cused for it all. T did want her to marry. It look like a pity for&#xD;
her not to git married. And now she is married, and what have she married?&#xD;
A nasty, da-dblasted thievious Yankee, and aint even married at that. She is&#xD;
married and she aint married ; and I don't understand it; and ef there's&#xD;
conchekenches, thay aint nobody can tell what it wil be; and (Georgy's name&#xD;
wiil go down to posterity, and the Peas wont be nobody any more ; and-Oh,&#xD;
Lordy l&#xD;
'Pap, do  or goodness gracious' sake, hush and come in the house,' said&#xD;
Georgiana, advancing to the front door. 'The Lord 'knows I'm glad I aint&#xD;
married ; and if thenLot11  women don't grieve after him any more than I&#xD;
grieve after him, they've done forgot him, that's all. Pap, do come in the&#xD;
house.'_&#xD;
Mr. Pea subsided, and the mnedif rode away. Mr. Pucket begged Mr. Trip-&#xD;
let to hasten, but the latter, who wau too old to be running for nothing, de-&#xD;
clared in round terms that he'd be dinged ef he did.&#xD;
'I wouldn't a made myself ridiculous, Pap, before company, if I'd a been in&#xD;
your place. That was pretty talk to have before men, and I in the house&#xD;
hearin every word.'&#xD;
Mr. Pea, hearing himself accused of a new crime, couldn't stand it.&#xD;
'I do believe that if old S'aton was to come, it would be me that fotch him,&#xD;
or leastways sent for him, and I'd as leave he had a come as that d-adblasted&#xD;
Yankee: Yes, its me, in cose its me. 'Anything wrong, I done it; oh, yes,&#xD;
in chose, certing. Whar's my hat?' And the good man sallied forth to his&#xD;
field, where he remained until dinner time. . There were so many contending&#xD;
emotions in his breast that he ate in silence. Georgiana had a good appetite ;&#xD;
she ato away with a gusto and eyed her father amusedly.&#xD;

'Pap, if I'll tell you solnething will you swear you'll keep it ?-&#xD;
Uncle Ben laid down his knife and forlt and gazed at her in amazement.&#xD;
'Wi    our mouth, Pap, and tell me if you'll swear.&#xD;
'WhatV it?' he dsmanded authoritatively.&#xD;
'Wil  ou swear, I asked you?'&#xD;
at's a mighty pooty question for a child to ask its parent.'&#xD;

- 'Pap, I've heard you often talkin against the Free Uasons. I never thought&#xD;
they were so mighty bad. What do they do that is so awful bad?'&#xD;
'You don't do you? -o, I suppose you don't ; in cose yon don't, takin&#xD;
after them as you do, in cose you don't '&#xD;
'How do I take after 'em?'&#xD;
'In havin o' secrets that's a sin to keep, and in tryin to make people sway&#xD;
that they won't tell 'em, and not even to their own parrents. That's how you&#xD;
are takin arter them.'&#xD;
'Oh, yes, I see now,' she said, appearing to muse. 'Still this is something&#xD;
that I couldn't tell without your swearing not to mention to a blessed soul.&#xD;
Its worth swearin ,for, pap,'&#xD;
'Ar it anything concerning that mean runaway Yankee?'-&#xD;
'If it is will you swear ?t&#xD;
'Ye, I WILL, and cuss too, if you sent one. I've been a cussin to myself&#xD;
all day any how.'&#xD;
'You've cussed to other people besides yourself, but I only want you to&#xD;
swear.'&#xD;
She brought the family Bible.&#xD;
'La, Georgy, is you in yearnest sure enou8h ? Why, what do you means?&#xD;
You aint no Jestice.'&#xD;
It made no difference ; she made him placehis hand on the book and swear,&#xD;
that he would never reveal what she was going to tell him without her' con-&#xD;
sent. Uncle Ben was very solemn while the oath was being administerd.&#xD;
&#xD;
It required several minutes to impart the secret. The old man's joy was&#xD;
boundless. He jumped up and ran into his own room, where he cut up more&#xD;
capers than any one could have believed that he could cut up ; he ran back&#xD;
again, made Georgiana rise from the table, hugged her, and made her sit down&#xD;
again; he rushed to the front door and huzzaed to the outer world ; he rushed&#xD;
back again and hugged Georgy as'she sat. Then he took his seat again and&#xD;
looked upon hei- with ineffable admiration. Suddenly be grew serious.&#xD;
'Oh, Georgy' no if I only had- '&#xD;
B efore he could speak further she taken something from her bosom, and&#xD;
handed it to him. He seized it with both hands, gazed at it, held it at arm''&#xD;
length and gazed at it, opened and looked into it, shut it up again, held it for&#xD;
a moment to his ear, patted it gently, laid it on the table, then lifted up his&#xD;
voice and wept.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;

Julias Ciesar.&#xD;
When the news of Mr. Black's escapade reached Dukesborouigh, there wa5&#xD;
running to and fro; business was suspended. Somq asked if the like had&#xD;
ever been heard of. Otlhers asked every body if they hadn't told him so. J.&#xD;
Spouter was among the former, and Mr. Bill Williams among the latter. He&#xD;
got leave of absence from  the store in order to roam  up and down all the&#xD;
forenoon, for the purpose of proving that he l1ad prophesied what had taken&#xD;
place or its equivalent. He was delighted. My observation is that almost&#xD;
everybody is, by the verification of a prophecy, which he has made, or which&#xD;
he thinks he has made. Miss Spouter tried to laugh, but she didn't make&#xD;
much ont of it. Mrs. Spouter didn't laugh at all. How could she when she&#xD;
remembered the plates of butter that had'been consumed not only without&#xD;
thanks but without pay? She did all the talking in the domestic circle. Mr.&#xD;
Spouter- seemed inclined to be taciturn.. He 'merely remarked that he had&#xD;
never been so outed in his born days, and then shut up. But, then, Mr.&#xD;
'Spouter never had much to say when Mrs. Sp outer had the floor ; If how-&#xD;
ever, he had had the floor now, there was nothing for him to say. He had&#xD;
not sued his debtor but for reasons other than the being a merciful creditor.&#xD;
He was not used to such things. Indeed, the very word SUIT was, and had&#xD;
long been, disagreeable to .his ear. So much so. that he had never gone into&#xD;
court of his own accord. It was one of his boasts, in comparing himself with&#xD;
some others, that he had never been plaintiff in an action, and never expected&#xD;
to be. He always discouraged people from going to law, maintaining that&#xD;
people never got much by going there, a remark that was true, when con-&#xD;

fined in its application to those who had gone there, carrying him vith them&#xD;
Yet, Mr. Spouter ieldom lost a bill, It was always a 'wonder to me how&#xD;
rapidly persons in his condition could collect their bills. But this time Mr.&#xD;
Spouter, as he said, was outed.. As he didn't relish Mr. Bill Williams' joke,&#xD;
and as Mrs. Spouter didn't, and at last, as Miss Spouter didn't, Mr. B. W. had&#xD;
to suspend.&#xD;
Poor Mr.- Puoket! his mind had been set upon.a fee; but as no one. could&#xD;
be found wh could run fastar than Mr. Triplet, and as the fugitive had gotten&#xD;
three days' start, there was no pursuit.  None but a briefless lawyer. can.&#xD;
imagine how badly'Mr. Pucket felt.&#xD;
'And so. she isn't married after all !' said Miss Spouter to herself, when she&#xD;
was alone in her chamber that night. 'Not married after all; no more than&#xD;
I am. Yes, I suppose more than I am, because she thought she was married,&#xD;
'and I KNEW I wasn't. That makes some difference; and .then--and then&#xD;
-,' but it was too wonderful for Miss Spouter, she couldn't make it out. .So&#xD;
she only, said, 'Qh, I wonder how she feels!'&#xD;
Now, there was but one way to get the desired information, and that was&#xD;
to se her and hear it from her own mouth. To most persons that way would&#xD;
seem to be barred, because the last'tinje the two ladies met, IJis's SpoutEr had&#xD;
refused to speak.. But it did not seem so to her ; she would herself remove&#xD;
all obstacles: SHE WOULD FORGIVE UEORGE! Yes, that she would. Wasn't'&#xD;
it noble to forgive?  Didn't the Bible teach us to forgive ?  Yes, she would&#xD;
forgiye. What a glory overspread the heart of the injured when, in that ten,&#xD;
der moment, she found she could forgive. She wished now that she had gone&#xD;
to Georgiana to-day; she would 'go to-morrow. Malice should never have an&#xD;
abiding place in that heart. It might have it in other people's herrts, but it&#xD;
never should have it in that one. She laid herself calmly and sweetly upon&#xD;
her bed, and was forcibly reminded, as she thought of herself and her conduct,&#xD;
of the beauty and the serenity of a summer's evening.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIl.&#xD;
&#xD;
"In that same place thou hast (tjppoiutedl me&#xD;
To-morrow truly will Imeet with thee."&#xD;
Midsummer-Night's Dream.&#xD;
Mr. Pea writhed and chafed under his oath. He begged his Georgy to let&#xD;
him tell somebody. He swore another oath that he should die if he didn't.&#xD;
He did tell it there in the house several times to imaginary auditors, after&#xD;
looking out of the doors and windows to see if no real ones were near. Even&#xD;
when he'was out of doors, he' went' all about whispering excitedly to himself,&#xD;
occasionally laughing most tumultuously. Ueorgiana became uneasy.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Pap, are you going to run distracted again?'&#xD;
'Georgy, of I don't believe I am I'll--- you may kill me.'&#xD;
Georgiana had to yield. She wished to see Mr. Spouter upon a little matter&#xD;
of business connected with Mr. Slack, and she concluded to consent for him to&#xD;
be sent for and her father to inform him of what she saw he must inevitably&#xD;
tell somebody. The old man was extremely thankful, but he wanted to make&#xD;
a request.&#xD;
'Georgy, you must let me send for rjplet. 've 'got a good joke on Trip-&#xD;
let, a powerful joke on him. And he's a officer, Georgy, too,' he added, se-&#xD;
riously.&#xD;
 'Triplet is a officer. This case, an'a leetle more, an' it would a got into&#xD;
cote ; an' as Triplet ar' a officer, he ought to be here in cose.'&#xD;
Georgiana consented on hearing this last argument. But she expressly 'i-&#xD;
joined upon her father, that at any period of his disclosures, when she called&#xD;
upon him to stop, he had to do it. Ie promised to obey, and the servant&#xD;
was sent into Dukesborough with the request that Messrs. Spouter  &amp;amp; Triplet&#xD;
should come out the next morning on particular business. Georgiana knew&#xD;
fully what she, who was her friend but now, alas, abandoned, was thinking&#xD;
about, and therefore she was included in the summons.&#xD;
Early the next morning the )arty arrived. Miss Spouter alighted ii great&#xD;
agitation, rushed through the front room into Georgiana's who was there&#xD;
waiting for what she knew was to happen, looked all around as if she was ex-&#xD;
pecting to find somebody besides Georgiana, fell upon her in the old way&#xD;
pronounced her pardon, and then demanded to he told all aboat it. Oh, my!&#xD;
Dreadful! Did ever ! Vain and foolislh man ! How did Georgiana feel!&#xD;
Georgiana led her into her father's room, which also served for tln  parlor.&#xD;
She was surprised and annoyed to find Mr. Pucket there with the other gen-&#xD;
tlemen. Mr, Pucket had, somehow, gotten the wind of it, and said to himself&#xD;
that he didn't know what might happen. lie had been told by an old lawyer&#xD;
that the only way for a young man to succeed at the bar was to push hims olf&#xD;
forward. So he determined to go, and he went. Uncle Ben was glad of it.&#xD;
lie was going, for the first time in his life, to make a speech, and he wished as&#xD;
large an audience as possible. No, no; in cose there wern't no intrusion, and&#xD;
no nothin of the sort, nor nothin else.&#xD;
Georgiana sat very near her father.&#xD;
Then he opened his mouth and began:&#xD;
'You see, gentul-mhen, it was all my fault, from the fast. \After Georgy&#xD;
seed him she didn't think much of him. She said she didn't keer about mar"&#xD;
ryin no how, and ef the did, she wanted it to be to a Southering man. But I&#xD;

and him too, we overpersuaded her. He seemed to think so much of me and&#xD;
her too; and he had a store, and 'peared like a man well to do. And I did&#xD;
want to see my only daughter settle herself. the feelin is nat'ral, as you know&#xD;
yourself, Mr. Spouter ; all parrents that has daughters, has 'em, ain't it so.&#xD;
Mr. Spouter?'    C&#xD;
Mr. Spouter answered rather by his manner than in words. Miss Spouter&#xD;
became confused, and didn't look at Mr. Pucket when he coughed, although&#xD;
he was a married man. Mr. Triplet had seen somewhat of life in his time,&#xD;
still he took a chew of tobacco.,&#xD;
'Go on, pap,' said Georgiana.'&#xD;
'Yes; well, you see, getulmen, rich it war-any how they got married.&#xD;
Georgy said when she gin her consent, she gin it to keep me from runnin dis-&#xD;
tracted, as it did 'pear like I war. Howbeever, I ar clean out o' that now.&#xD;
Circumances is altered powerful, Well, as I said, any how they got married&#xD;
-that is, they didn't git married, because he were already married .and -thay&#xD;
warn't no law for it, as you know yourself, Mr. Pucket, they warn't. But..-&#xD;
al-leastways they went throo the-ah-the motions and the-ah-gittin out&#xD;
lisens, and the.--ah--stannin up in the floor and jinin o' hands, and he come&#xD;
here to live. Well now, don't you b'leeve that Georgy, she spishoned him&#xD;
from the very fust day : for no sooner were he married hardly, than he began&#xD;
to reach~behind every nuke and corner about here, and before night, bless your&#xD;
soul, he knowed more about whar things was in this house than I did. Least..&#xD;
ways, Georgy says  o, and its obleeged to be so; for there's things, many of&#xD;
'em in this house that I don't know whar thay are.' And Mr. Pea looked&#xD;
around and above, taking as big a view as if he were surveying the whole&#xD;
universe.&#xD;
'Well, Georgy, she and he tuk a walk that fust evenin. Instid of talkin&#xD;
along like tether folks that's jest got married, he went right straight to talking&#xD;
about settlin hisself, and put at her to begin right away to git all she could,&#xD;
out'n me ; which, Georgy, she didn't like no sich, and no body wouldn't a&#xD;
liked it that thought anything of herself. You wouldn't, Angeline Spbuter,&#xD;
- you know you wouldn't, the very fust day you was married.'&#xD;
'Go on, pap, please.'&#xD;
'Yes, well, Georgy spishuned him agin at supper, from the way he looked&#xD;
at the spoons on the table ; which of they had a been the genuine silver, they&#xD;
would'nt a been in this house now, to my opinion, probly, leastways, ef.--,&#xD;
uncle Ben smiled and concluded to postpone the balance of this sentence.&#xD;
'Well, you bee, Georgy Ann, arter supper, she got sick, she did, and she&#xD;
bilt on to her head powerful. In coe bed time, hit had to come arter a while,,&#xD;

when hit did come, she were wusser, and she give that feller a candle to go&#xD;
long to bed by hisself. When she went to bed, I thought she was a goin on'&#xD;
 I thar in cose, like 'tother married people; but she, instid o' that, she went&#xD;
on thoo into the little jinin back room and she locked the door arter her. I&#xD;
never knowed one word o' this untel arter ho went off. Well, arter he went&#xD;
to sleep, Georgy, she heered a mighty groanin. So she ups, she does, an&#xD;
onlocks the door and creeps in mighty sly. It seem like he ware dreaming&#xD;
and talkin in his sleep powerful. He called names, sich as Jemimy, Susan&#xD;
Jane, Betsy Ann, and-what was all them names, Georgy?'&#xD;
'It makes no difference, pap, go on.'&#xD;
'And a heap more of 'em. Georgy can tell you. Cose ho heard 'em over&#xD;
and oging. Well, he seemed to be powerful shamed of all of 'em, and he swore&#xD;
'he wern't married and them that said so was a liar, and all sich, Well, sich&#xD;
carrin on made Georgy b'leve that he was a married man befo, and had two&#xD;
or three wives already, or probable four or five. And'so she jist wouldn't&#xD;
sleep with him no how. She-well, in fac, she jist didn't think she was&#xD;
liable too sleep with him. And she was right, Triplet, she was right, wasn't&#xD;
she Triplet?'&#xD;
'In cose,' answered Mr. Triplet.&#xD;
"'IDo go on, pap.',&#xD;
'Well, yes. Yit still she didn't let on. She kept up tolerable well in the&#xD;
day time, but when night come, Georgy she kep on gittin sick, and going into&#xD;
the jinin little room. I never seed sich carrin on befo.'&#xD;
,    Uncle Ben would stop and laugh some. Georgy begged him to go on.&#xD;
'Well, she kep ona hearin him a going on, and you think she would tell me&#xD;
the fast'thing o' all this. Ef she had a told me, howbeever, that aint neither&#xD;
here nor thar. Well, it seem he talked in his sleep about other people be-&#xD;
sides wimniing, about men and about money, and declared on his soul that he&#xD;
never stole it, which goes to show Georgy that he war a rog t as well as a&#xD;
rascal about wimming. Yit in this time he begin to hint even around me&#xD;
about property, and even insinivated that he would like to have the whole&#xD;
plantation and all that's on it.' Mr. Pea showed plainly by his manner, after&#xD;
making this last remark, that no man had ever had an ambition more bound-&#xD;
less than the late Mr. Slack.&#xD;
'But I mighty soon give him to understand that he war barkin up the&#xD;
wrong tree of he thought I was gwine to give up this plantation and my&#xD;
property before my head got cold. Them's always fools that does it.'&#xD;

knowed that was all I keered about it for, that I told him, I'd pay for a nigger&#xD;

about having to go to Augusty. But shore enuff, arter he had been here&#xD;
two or three days, he had to go too Augusty, or somewhar else. Becase he&#xD;
got a letter which skeered him powerful, an he said hp. war goili right off. I&#xD;

he's goin to fetch her a nigger''oman when he come back. She has hip got a&#xD;
mighty good smack of vittles, and what ain't common for dinner, she puts on&#xD;
the table a plate of nice fresh butter and a plenty of biscuit, Triplet,' Mr. Pea&#xD;
now looked as sly and as good humored as it was possible for him to be.&#xD;
'Triplet, I've got a good joke on&#xD;
Mr. Triplet seemed to guess what it was, and smiled suybduedly.&#xD;
'You know what you said about my never seem  certing people and certin&#xD;
things- .certing property no more?'&#xD;
Mr. Triplet acknowledged that he did.&#xD;
'Well, Triplet, part of it was so and part of it were not so, all which both is&#xD;
,jist as I wants it to be. Triplet, that butter and them biscuit is what saved&#xD;
"      me. He never expected to eat no. more tell he got to Augusty, and I tell you&#xD;
he hung to that butter and them biscuit. While he 'was at 'em, and Georgy&#xD;
she made 'em late a coming in a purpose, she takes some old keys which she&#xD;
had picked up, and finds one that could onlock his peleese whar she seed him&#xD;
put the money, and whar she knowed he kep all he had.'&#xD;
Uncle Ben intended to laugh mercilessly at Triplet, but he was stopped by&#xD;
the sight of r. Pucket, who did as if he was trying to swallow something that&#xD;
was too big or his throat.&#xD;
'Ar anything the matter vith you Mr. Pucket? Is you got a cold?  Ar&#xD;
your that so?' asked the old gentleman, with undisguised interest:&#xD;
Triplet snickered as Mr. Pucket denied being sick,&#xD;
Uncle Ben proceeded&#xD;
'So she jest opened it sly as a mice and took out my money-'&#xD;
And what else? eagerly asked Mr, Pucket.&#xD;
'My watch, that the billion beg me to let him take with him to have it&#xD;
worked on, which I didn't like no--.-~'&#xD;
'What else?' asked Mr. Pucket again.&#xD;
'That's the last pint I'm a coming too, and that's why Georgy sent arter Mr.&#xD;
Spouter. She knowed that he owed Mr. Spouter thirry dollars, and she made&#xD;
p   r md to pay the debt as now she seed his money, and she tuck out&#xD;
thirty dollars o' his money, which here it ar for you Mr. Spouter.'&#xD;

'I garnishee the thirty dollars,' interposed Mr. Pocket, holding out his hands.&#xD;
'You are too late,' answered Mr. Spouter, taking the money, putting it into&#xD;
his pocket, and lookgiii as if he bad gotten in again after being ousted by Mr.&#xD;
Mack.     '&#xD;
'Can't I garnishee, Triplet :''.&#xD;
'Garnishee for whit?'&#xD;
'For my fee?'    '&#xD;
'Fee for what ?'&#xD;
'Why, for my ser 'ices in -4h,- coming out here on two occasions.'&#xD;
'Well-you can't garnishee.'&#xD;
Mr. Triplet looked as if he was ashamed of Mr. Pocket. Uncle Ben hoped&#xD;
there was goin' to be no bad feelins, and no difficulties.&#xD;
'Certainly not,' answered Mr. Triplet. 'Mr. Pucket ar' a young lawyer, and&#xD;
forgot at the minit that it war other peeple that owed him for his services in&#xD;
stid of M Slack: resides, furthermo, Mr. Packet ought to know that you&#xD;
can't garnishee jist dry so,. without fast gittin' out some sort o' )aper-from the&#xD;

dollars befo he got it, that is, ef Spouter wanted too.' Mr. Triplet looked in-&#xD;
terrogatingly at the 'tother gentleman.&#xD;
'Yes, ef I wanted too,' answered Mr: S., oraculously:&#xD;
'But,' persisted Mr. Pucket,'there was other monies.'&#xD;
'Whar?' asked Mr. Triplet.&#xD;
*In Mr. Slack's trunk.'&#xD;
'No they want,' answered Mr. Pea, who thought he ought to keep Mr.&#xD;
Pucket to the true word. 'They was in his peleesc.'&#xD;
'Well, in his peleese. That makes no difference,' and Mr. Pocket looked as&#xD;
if he thought he had them on that point.&#xD;
'Puget,' said Triplet, 'it won't make no difference. You are right. 11 don't&#xD;
make nary bit o' difference with no body, ncr with your fee neither. That fee&#xD;
ar' a lost ball. They amt no money here to pay it with; an' cfthere was it&#xD;
would be Mr. Slack's lawyer, and not you that would git it. Well, gin it&#xD;
and another time try to have better luck.'&#xD;
Mr. Pucket was a young lawyer, and was, in part, owned by Mr. TI'riplet.&#xD;
So he subsided. Uncle Ben looked troubled, until the sheriff assured him that&#xD;
there could be no difficulties. 'Go on, uncle Ben. You got your gun, of cours?'&#xD;
'Triplet, you rascal ! You may laugh ; but I don't want the gun. i-e may&#xD;
keep it, and do what he pleases with it, even to blowin' out his own thevious&#xD;
brains with-it for what 1 keer. Lie's welcome to the gun. You Triplet!'&#xD;
'Don't mind me, uncle Ben. Go on.'&#xD;
'Well, thar's lots more to tell of Georgy would only let tne; and some tuiigs&#xD;
as would make you laugh powerful, Triplet, of you was to hear 'em.. But she's&#xD;
made me swar, actily swar, that I won't tell without her leave. Maybe she'll&#xD;
tell your ole 'oman] spme o' these days. Well, I felt'mighty glad when I got my&#xD;
money back, and, ef any thing, a wosser gladder when I got back my watch&#xD;

as round as a turnip,) 'when I seed her agin, ef I didn't cry you may kill me.&#xD;
I've had her thirty year, and none o' your new-fangled ones can beat her run'&#xD;

After hearing parts of the story over several times, the party rose to go.&#xD;
Mr. Tlriplet rising, said that in cose it war not any of his bisines-, but he would&#xD;
like to ax Miss G.eorgy one question, ef he wouldn't be considered as meddlin'&#xD;
with what didn't belong to him ; and that was why she didn't tell on the villion&#xD;
as soon as she found him out. GeorgiTana answered:&#xD;
'Well, Mr. Triplet, I many times thought I would ; bui you see I did'nt&#xD;
know for certain that he had done all the things that I was afraid be had. Be.&#xD;
sides, Mr. Triplet, even if he was't t my husband, I one time thought he was;&#xD;
and before God and man, I had promised to-be faihful to him., And then he&#xD;
had staid in this house, and eat at our table, and-and called pap father, and-&#xD;
and-and- Well, Mr. Triplet, somehow it d don't look right for me to be the&#xD;
first one to turn against him; and--and wheh I did -think cf telling on him,&#xD;
something would rise up and tell me that I ought not.'&#xD;
'Wimming aint like men no how, uncle-Bin,'. said rT'riplet, wiping his eye as&#xD;
- he bade him good bye.-&#xD;
'No they aint, Tripkt,' and he laid his hanr1 fondly on hi daughter'sshoal&#xD;
der while the tears ran down his cheelks.&#xD;
The visitors now left, all except Miss Spouter. She wished to get behind&#xD;
the scenes and know more. How much more she leaf ned I cannot say. They&#xD;
went to bed early when the day ended, and to sleep late. 'There was something&#xD;
which made them easily reunite. It wasfa pity. Miss Spouter imagined that&#xD;
she pitied Sher friend because she had been deceived by a man. even more than&#xD;
herse f had ever been, and because of the hurtful influence which that decep-&#xD;
tion would probably exert upon any future expectations of marria e. Miss&#xD;
Pea, who, instead of having any regrets, felt relief in the thought that hence-&#xD;
forth her father would be satisfield to allow her to manage such matters for&#xD;
herself, and that she should be satisfied to have none to manage, really pitied&#xD;
her friend because she yet yearned for-an' impossible estate. When the time&#xD;
came for them -to go to sleep, (and Georgiana thought it long coming) she&#xD;
id not wait a moment. ,Miss Spouter lay awake some time further. She&#xD;
pondered long on what she had heard. It was'strange. It was almost like a&#xD;
novel, How could George be still the same GJeorgiana Pea ? She had been&#xD;
Mrs. Slack. Wasn't she Mrs. Slack now ; and how, oh ! how exciting every-&#xD;
thing must have been. Her thoughts followed M r. Slack a while ; but he was&#xD;
so far away that they came back and went looking after Mr. Bill Williams.&#xD;
He was not much, but he was something. Ie had never exhibited any regard&#xD;
for her yet, but it was possible that he would some day. He wyas at least ten&#xD;
years younger than herself,  But her'curls were the same as ever, and besides,&#xD;
were not marriages made'in Heaven? or were they not a lottery, or something&#xD;
f        of the sort ?. Who knows?  Mr. Bill Williams, after all, might be the very&#xD;
one to whom the, something in h  r alluded when it had so repeatedly told&#xD;
her that she was destined to make some man so happy. rihen her mind&#xD;
turned again, and notwithstand ng Mr. Slack's great distance ahead, it started&#xD;
foth in the direction he had taken. She dwelt upon his strange conduct and&#xD;
his- unipg away, d although it was plain that he had done the like before,&#xD;
an wlen :he had~ never seen her nor heard of her, yet, she halfway persuaded&#xD;
herself that. she was the cause, though the perfectly innocent cause, of it all.&#xD;
" ~~    Yes,, yes I'she was saying to herself, as sleep stole upon her at last, 'he is&#xD;
.one, but the image of Angeline Spouter is i'n his br-east, and it will stay there&#xD;
