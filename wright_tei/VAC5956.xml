               <p>THE fortunate father of so fair and gentle a daughter as the heroine of the
                  following pages, might well pride himself upon the gift! And no one could better
                  appreciate so priceless a family jewel than Harry Noell, the poor Light-Keeper of
                  Beachy Head.</p>
               <p>In storm and sunshine, when the angry sea dashed wildly upon the rough eastern
                  coast of England, amid the calm or riot of the elements, Nelly was ever unchanged
                  in her devotion to the duties that devolved on her—always ready to aid her
                  good-hearted, but impoverished father, in the arduous routine of his labors. And
                  her share of the daily task that fortune had imposed upon the parent was by no
                  means light or easy; yet she resigned herself cheerfully and earnestly to its
                  performance, forgetful of her own comforts or convenience, unmindful and heedless
                  of all danger or jeopardy, so that she relieved, in any degree, the hardships or
                  the toil to which her loved and affectionate sire was so constantly exposed in his
                  precarious vocation.</p>
               <p>Few occupations are so thankless, and few positions are so poorly repaid for the
                  risk and responsibilities attendant thereon, as is that of the light-house keeper.
                  Yet these situations are sought after, and are eagerly taken up by the hardy and
                  venturesome, because there is a certain income attending them, from government;
                  and thus—though the emolument be trifling, and too often, entirely inadequate to
                  compare with the perils to be encountered—competent and worthy men are readily
                  found to fill these posts, so important and needful to universal commerce.</p>
               <p>Harrison Noel—<emph>Harry</emph> Noell, as he was familiarly called—had long been
                  the poor recipient of the king's favor, in the capacity of light-house keeper, at
                  the perilous point we have alluded to; and, so well did he value the companionship
                  and services of his only child, that he appropriately denominated her <emph>his
                     treasure</emph>. And indeed this was the only "treasure" he could boast of—for,
                  excepting the plain and scanty furniture that was scattered over his humble<pb
                     n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5956-00000003"/> dwelling, a rough but serviceable wardrobe,
                  a few books, and a boat or two of small value—he laid claim to no worldly goods or
                  adornments.</p>
               <p>Yet Harry Noell was happy—content with his lot, idolized by and dearly loving his
                  daughter, whilst in health, inured to the hardships of his calling, and esteemed
                  by the few who knew him, or of him—he had little care for the future, save to
                  provide, if possible, at the proper time, for the coming welfare of his child.
                  Nelly had come to be nearly eighteen years old, and the father looked upon her
                  ripened and yet ripening charms with all a parent's fond solicitude.</p>
               <p>"I cannot give her fortune," he would say to himself, as he contemplated the
                  future for her, "alack! I have no fortune to bestow! She is so like her
                  angel-mother, too. It would be hard indeed if she must be joined to one who cannot
                  better provide for her comfort and happiness, than her poor father has been able
                  to do."</p>
               <p>Poor—ambitious—over-anxious Harry Noell! How little did he reflect that his
                  "treasure" was as happy as any bird upon the wing, always joyous and contented in
                  her, humble home—never dreaming of being separated from her parent, and having no
                  wish for any change of life from that which she had only known, thus far, from the
                  cradle, up.</p>
               <p>"To be sure," Harry would argue, mentally, as he brooded upon the subject, "her
                  mother lost no time, and spared no care in her education, before she was taken
                  away from us; and Nelly has well profited from the instruction bestowed on her.
                  But she has seen little of the world, society would startle her, should she be
                  suddenly thrown upon other than her present resources, and I must look to it,
                  seasonably."</p>
               <p>When the wind howled along the dreary coast, and when the combers rolled in
                  roughly against the long rocky beach below the light-house, such thoughts as these
                  would force themselves on Harry's mind. The day that was now just closing had been
                  a gloomy one, and the light-keeper found himself alone, thus buried in thought,
                  intent upon some plans of temporal advantage for his daughter's benefit, at such
                  time as he might, peradventure, be taken away from her—or when she should have
                  become "of age." As the evening shadows begun to hang over the land and sea, it
                  was the custom at the light, before sunset to survey the horizon with the glass,
                  and note if any vessels were in sight. While her father lingered in his room,
                  still thinking of what he might do for his daughter's good, Nelly had taken the
                  glass for the customary examination before the lighting of the lanterns—when she
                  descried, far away to windward, a small object that resembled a craft of some
                  kind—upset or dismantled, apparently—and encumbered with a sail or large sheet of
                  cloth. She lost no time in apprising her father of the discovery.</p>
               <p>"It may be a yawl, or a long-boat—possibly a yacht," said Nelly, as her father
                  hurried on a rough-weather suit, "but I can't make it out exactly. At all events,
                  it is a disabled boat of some kind; for I could distinctly see a large sail, I
                  think, adrift upon the starboard side."</p>
               <p>"How does it bear?" asked Harry.</p>
               <p>"Here, to the south-eastward," was the reply, as Nelly handed her parent the
                  glass.</p>
               <p>"Go you, Nelly," added her father, "and set the lights. The evening is so foggy I
                  can make out nothing whatever. Are you certain the object lay at the
                  southward?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, father, to the southward and eastward."</p>
               <p>"The wind has hauled since three o'clock," continued the light-keeper, "and it
                  must drift beach-ward, whatever it may be. Set the lights, and we will go down and
                  keep a good look-out for it."</p>
               <p>While Nelly was engaged as directed, the old man hastened down to the edge of the
                  lower reef. The rocks jutted their black crowns from out the water, and the surge
                  rolled heavily in from the sea, as both wind and tide were now tending shoreward.
                  The brilliant lights quickly shot up from the top of the cone like building, and
                  the tall tower with its bright glare stood like a huge sentinel with eyes of fire
                  gazing out upon the troubled and heaving waters. The mist thickened, however, and
                  it was soon impossible to see anything but a vast expanse of haze, illumined by
                  the strong light until the surrounding atmosphere appeared like a mass of
                  half-transparent snow.</p>
               <p>Noell placed a large trumpet to his lips, and at the top of his lungs he shouted
                  "hilli'o! ho—ho!" but the sound died without-an echo on that lonely and ragged
                  shore, when his daughter suddenly hurried to his side once more.</p>
               <p>"I think, father," she said, "if we should take to the boat and touch at the outer
                  point of the ledge, we might possibly learn more of the party in distress, if it
                  be some unfortunate craft or tender that is crippled."</p>
               <p>"So we might, Nelly," said the old man, "but do you not observe how the sea runs?
                  It would be no easy task to reach the outer reef, with both wind and tide so
                  strong against us."</p>
               <p>"But, father, it may be that we may thus save a life or lives, haply, and—"</p>
               <p>"Right, girl, right; I will go," responded Noell, at once; and he turned towards
                  his dory that lay up on the beach. When he launched it, as he did in a moment
                  longer, Nelly sprang into it, first, and seized the bow oar without a word of
                  remark.</p>
               <p>"No, my daughter, no," said the light-keeper, "you need not go, to-night."</p>
               <p>"But I prefer to be with you, father."</p>
               <p>"Not this time, I can manage very well, alone. Go, see to the lights. It's a hard
                  pull, for the tide is now at half-flood; but I can stem it, and will soon return.
                  Give me the oar."</p>
               <p>A receding wave at this instant threw the dory into the surf, when Nelly sank upon
                  the narrow thwart, plunged her oar into the water, and cried:</p>
               <p>"Pull away, father—pull away. We'll soon be there; and, suiting her actions to the
                  word, she settled down to the work with so hearty a will that Noell found himself
                  obliged to lay to it, astern, to prevent the boat from being swamped.</p>
               <p>"I did not mean you should go out on the water to-night," said her father. "It is
                  cold and rough, and you will not be the gainer by it."</p>
               <p>"Pull away!" shouted Nelly, good-naturedly, "we've been out on these waters many a
                  worse night than this, surely. Steady, now, not too briskly," she continued,
                  throwing back her long, dark curls that fluttered around her shoulders. "And as to
                  being the gainer, if I can aid a poor sailor, or other unfortunate, who may be in
                  peril upon the great deep, am I not largely a gainer, when I afford such
                  relief?"</p>
               <p>"Right again, girl—right again. Steady now. How bears the point?"</p>
               <p>"A mile out, yet—nearly."</p>
               <p>"Not so far, I think."</p>
               <p>"We get on but slowly against the current. We are full three quarters of a mile
                  from the Gap. So, pull—now!"</p>
               <p>A brave girl was Nell Noell, truly, and a sweet creature, too, albeit she could
                  handle an oar, brail up a foresail, or set a jib, as readily as an old salt. But,
                  from her infancy, she had known no other kind of life; and she enjoyed its
                  excitement' and its pleasures vastly, for the occupation, from long experience,
                  had become a "part and parcel of her making-up."</p>
               <p>"What's that?" suddenly asked old Noell, as he peered up through the haze, at
                  something that was floating sluggishly inward, a cable's length to leeward of the
                  dory.</p>
               <p>"That's it—that's it!" shouted Nelly, instantly. "Slack your oar! Now, come
                  about."</p>
               <p>She recognized the object she had discovered two hours previously, and which had
                  drifted thus far toward the beach in the same condition that it was when first
                  seen by the light-keeper's daughter, from the shore. In a moment or two, the dory
                  was alongside the drift, which proved to be a small sloop-rigged yacht, on the way
                  to Dover, from a pleasure trip to Calais. Her mast had been broken, and the
                  mainsail lay extended over the stern and larboard quarter, dragging in the water.
                  A portion of the wreck had been cut away, as it proved, but there appeared no one
                  on board to tell the history of the accident. A grapple was put over the bow, and,
                  aided by wind and current, the dory returned to the beach in safety with the
                  prize.</p>
               <p>Noell lost no time, assisted by his daughter, in securing the dismantled craft in
                  a place of safety till morning. But, what was their surprise and terror, as they
                  were about leaving the yacht for the night, to hear a slight moan, or sigh, as if
                  proceeding from some one in deep bodily distress, on board the ill-fated
                  vessel!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE OCCUPANT OF THE YACHT.</head>
               <p>NELLY turned to look upon her father, and if she could have seen his face she
                  would have noticed the alarm that pervaded his features—but, fortunately, it was
                  too dark for any exchange of glances, at the moment—and so Nelly broke the
                  temporary silence, with the query:</p>
               <p>"Did you hear anything, father?"</p>
               <p>"It must be so," quickly responded Noell. "A light, Nelly, quickly—a light," and
                  the daughter hastened for a lantern.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, the light-keeper got on board the yacht, and hailed the supposed
                  sufferer, whose groaning was now clearly audible, from below. Whether there was
                  more than one person there, Noell could not determine; and the weight of the
                  canvass, saturated as it was with water and entangled in the torn rigging, was so
                  great as to prevent him, in the pitchy darkness, from ascertaining but the mere
                  fact (which he could not now mistake) that some one was in pain and peril on board
                  the little wreck.</p>
               <p>A light was very shortly seen in the distance, and the cheering voice of Nell was
                  heard above the rocks, as she hurried on, shouting, "coming, father—coming!" and,
                  as she tripped along to his side, she asked:</p>
               <p>"Who is it? Have you found him? What has happened to them?"</p>
               <p>"I know nothing, yet, Nelly," said the parent; "but, bear-a-hand now, ease up this
                  sheet, so, press the sail over—cheerily! so she moves, now, that is well—bring the
                  light."</p>
               <p>The lantern was placed on the stern of the boat, and close by the heel of the
                  mast, beneath a heavy splinter, a boot was discovered. In the boot was a man's
                  foot, secured as closely to the side of the vessel as if it had grown there. And,
                  as the search was continued, a body was quickly made out. It proved to be that of
                  a young man about twenty years old, who lay in the lee scupper, upon his face,
                  well nigh drowned, or smothered, and who was instantly raised up from his awful
                  situation, to afford him a chance to breathe, provided it were not too late!</p>
               <p>The fragment of timber that had pinioned him was then forced away, the mast fell
                  over the side, and the youth was drawn up out of the ruins and the water, almost
                  lifeless. He made no sign, and gave no evidence that the spirit had not fled, save
                  a low, deep sighing, or rather heavy breathing, as if his lungs had been crushed,
                  apparently—and probably—by the mast as it fell. Though Noell repeatedly and kindly
                  interrogated him, he obtained no sort of reply, save groans; and taking him up on
                  his back, as gently as it was possible to handle him, Nelly slowly led the way
                  with the flickering lantern, and the injured man was borne to the light-keeper's
                  dwelling.</p>
               <p>When morning came (after a night passed with watching and bathing and friction),
                  the young man was found to be apparently free from excessive pain, and no bones
                  were found broken. The right foot was badly bruised, and a contusion on the
                  forehead showed that a severe blow must have felled the sufferer, at the time of
                  the accident. Beyond this, and the fever consequent upon such seeming rough usage,
                  the unfortunate man was as comfortable as could be anticipated. He was quite
                  unconscious of his situation, however. Opiates were given him, to alleviate his
                  pains, and he slept, at last, quietly and easily.</p>
               <p>The vessel was examined and thoroughly overhauled as soon as the day broke. No
                  other bodies were found on board, but the little craft proved to be a beautiful
                  vessel, well appointed and elegantly furnished. Under her stern-rail were found in
                  a gilded scroll, the words "WAIF, DOVER," and the same inscription appeared upon
                  several pieces of furniture in the choicely decorated little cabin. She was
                  strained, and some slight <choice>

                     <corr>injury</corr>
                  </choice> had occurred from the breaking of the mast; but otherwise, the yacht was
                  unharmed. For three days, such was the continued illness of the young stranger—no
                  farther information was elicited in regard to the wreck, except what we have
                  related and what was conjectured by the light-keeper and his daughter, who
                  continued to attend their patient with a fatherly and a sisterly care.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the third day after he entered Noell's house, the young man
                  struggled a good deal, as if dreaming of some fearful scene, in which he was
                  himself an actor.</p>
               <p>"Hold hard—up, <emph>hard</emph>, Manfred!" he cried, fitfully, as if giving some
                  earnest directions to a third person, in his sleep. "Now, ease her, gently—let go!
                  let go! Fast, foul! Cut away, cut the main-sheet! For God's sake, quick! There she
                  goes! Hold on, Manfred—<emph>ah!</emph>" and then he sprang up, wildly, from the
                  low mattress, to be seized by the powerful arms of Harry Noell, who was watching
                  at his bedside at the moment. He relapsed again into unconscious quiet, and his
                  benefactor was as wise as before in regard to the details of his history, or how
                  he was wrecked, save by surmise.</p>
               <p>As the discoloration of the bruise upon his forehead disappeared, a remarkable
                  brow was developed in the stranger's case. Broad and massive—now peculiarly white
                  and prominent, from his unusual paleness, probably—and very high, this feature was
                  strikingly noticeable. His other lineaments were regular and well fashioned, and
                  he might rightfully be termed an exceedingly handsome youth. His hands were small
                  and white, too, and the delicate fingers and nails showed plainly that he had
                  never seen much of toil or active labor.</p>
               <p>A small diamond ring of singularly antique shape and setting was discovered upon
                  his finger, which after two or three days Noell drew from his hand. On the inside
                  were the initials P. P. The ring was replaced, and nothing further could be
                  ascertained. After a week's delay (in the hope that the stranger would recover so
                  as to account for the accident), Noell resolved to visit Dover, and ascertain such
                  particulars as might be obtainable, under the circumstances. His intended trip was
                  interrupted, however, on the morning of his finally contemplated departure, by the
                  more favorable aspect of the stranger's symptoms. During the day, he came to
                  himself, once more, and suddenly accosted the light-keeper with the natural
                  question:</p>
               <p>"Where am I?"</p>
               <p>Noell was greatly rejoiced to hear his patient speak, and he quickly replied, in a
                  fatherly tone:</p>
               <p>"You are safe, and in good quarters."</p>
               <p>"And Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"Who is Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"My friend and patr—Manfred."</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued Noell, humoring his not yet clear mind, "I have heard that name
                  before; but I wanted to know who he is?"</p>
               <p>"I mean Manfred—my patron. And the <hi rend="i"/>Waif," continued the stranger,
                  "what became of her?"</p>
               <p>"She is safe, also, and is now moored beneath your window, yonder."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>the others</emph>," he continued, in a whisper, "the other two. What of
                  them?"</p>
               <p>The light-keeper saw that he was wandering again, and deemed the exertion too
                  great for him at present. So he told him to be quiet, (and he would tell him more
                  when he had had a little rest.</p>
               <p>"Tell me," said the patient, suddenly, once more—"who is she that flits about me,
                  here? I have seen her to-day, surely—and before this. How long have I been here?
                  What is her name? Was I not hurt? Who is she?"</p>
               <p>"That is a friend of yours," said Noell, pleasantly. "Now take some rest, and I
                  will talk further with you when you are refreshed, and are better able to
                  converse."</p>
               <p>By slow degrees, the wearied and wounded<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5956-00000005"/>
                  young man revived, and commenced to improve. His fever still clung to him, but he
                  was at length sufficiently recovered to be able to connect the hitherto broken and
                  imperfect account that his friends at the light-house had been so anxious to
                  arrive at.</p>
               <p>They learned from him, at length, that he had joined a little pleasure party at
                  Dover, and in company with his friend, Manfred, and two others, sailed for Calais,
                  in the yacht mentioned, where they arrived after a pleasant voyage. After a few
                  days passed there, they were returning home, when a squall came up, as they were
                  crossing the Straits of Dover. The little vessel had become unmanageable (from the
                  inexperience of her helmsman), and was thrown first aback, and then coming up, a
                  frightful gust caught her before the mainsail could be controlled. The rigging got
                  foul, the sheet being entangled below, and her mast suddenly crashed over the
                  side, as the "Waif" heeled upon her beam-ends! His companions were all washed into
                  the sea, and he must have shared their fate, but that he found himself, at that
                  instant, fastened to the deck—his foot having been caught by a portion of the
                  fallen mast.</p>
               <p>After an hour or two the sail eased up and the ruins slipped aft, when the hull
                  righted again, though he was still unable to escape from his frightful position.
                  Before night the yacht shipped a sea, which moved the mainsail forward once more,
                  covering him completely beneath its heavy folds. A loose block attached to the
                  halyards struck him upon the forehead, and he knew nothing further of yacht,
                  companions, or aught in life, until he found himself under the kindly protection
                  of the light-keeper and his lovely daughter.</p>
               <p>"But you have not yet informed us who is Manfred," said Noell: "I am desirous to
                  know more of him, that I may communicate with him, or his friends, and deliver to
                  him or them his property—for I understand you to say the yacht is his?"</p>
               <p>"You are right," continued the invalid. "Manfred was my early friend; and he has
                  latterly been a valued patron—whom I fear I am left to mourn for! He can scarcely
                  have been rescued, I imagine?" continued the youth, inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"That is by no means impossible," rejoined Noell, soothingly, (though he had
                  little cause to hope for such good fortune); "he may have been picked up by a
                  stray vessel, and I shall be glad to know that your friend is safe."</p>
               <p>"He is the only son of a gentleman of great wealth in London, and is now—or rather
                  he <emph>was</emph>, in the enjoyment of a handsome allowance. The 'Waif' belongs
                  to Manfred, and under ordinary circumstances he was competent to sail and manage
                  her—a performance he took great pride in. Our other friends, on board at the time
                  of the catastrophe, were his former college mates. But they are lost, I am
                  painfully certain—all lost, lost!"</p>
               <p>A paroxysm of grief filled his heart at the contemplation of this awful
                  probability, and he burst into tears as he dwelt on this terrible result.</p>
               <p>"There is much to hope for," said Nelly, at this moment, as she wiped the
                  perspiration from the white forehead of the sufferer. "Surely your own escape from
                  death is sufficiently marvellous to encourage the supposition that your companions
                  may have been saved, as well. Do you bear in mind that the same Power which guided
                  the shattered and crippled bark upon which you were so strangely fettered, into
                  the very wake of our little boat, may have dealt as kindly with your friends, in
                  some other manner? 'God moves in a mysterious way,'" continued the fair being
                  beside him, "and we may well trust to his mercy and wisdom."</p>
               <p>The youth was silent! He gazed into the soft, blue eyes of the lovely speaker, and
                  he felt the force and beauty of this gentle and touching reproof—so eloquently and
                  kindly expressed, and he then added:</p>
               <p>"I will hope—I <emph>do</emph> hope, for the best. Manfred is a noble-hearted
                  fellow, sir. If he still lives, you may readily communicate with him—Roswell
                  Manfred, Gent.:—at Dover. You will find it in your account, I promise you. Manfred
                  will not fail to reward your kindness to his friend, but, for myself, how can
                     <emph>I</emph> requite the unlimited care I have so unwittingly occasioned you?
                  And, as for your daughter, here—Nelly! I am unable to repay—I never can discharge
                  the debt I owe to <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You can, at least, tell us who you are," replied Nelly, with a womanly smile. "We
                  have not yet learned to call you by name; and thus you have the advantage of
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I had not thought of that," said the young man. "Sit down, Nelly. Sit
                  by me, sir, if you will—for I am quite strong to-day, and my history (which is
                  humble enough) will be very briefly told."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE ARTIST'S STORY.</head>
               <p>IT might occur to the reader, naturally enough, that the youth thus indebted to
                  unexpected kindness, at the hands of so fair a creature as now listened for the
                  stranger's recital, would very readily fall in love with so gentle and agreeable a
                  benefactor. Whether or not this were the case, remains to be developed hereafter.
                  He made no display of being thus affected, at any rate, whatever were his secret
                  sensations. Did Nelly care for <emph>him</emph>, particularly? Did the poor
                  light-keeper's only child, his cherished treasure, conceive a silent passion for
                  the handsome stranger, thus singularly thrown across her path, at a time when such
                  an event would not be deemed a <emph>very</emph> strange result? Had her manifold
                  attentions to the invalid, her care and nursing and watching all been prompted by
                  motives of benevolence and sense of duty, only? We shall see, as we proceed.</p>
               <p>"My name," he said, "is Alfred Wilford. My story can interest you but little, I am
                  sure, for it is very common-place in its details. I am alone in the world. You
                  have a father, Nelly, whose counsel and society you enjoy. I have neither father
                  nor mother living. When quite a boy, I was thrown upon my own resources for a
                  sustenance, and all the education I had received was that attainable at a common
                  school.</p>
               <p>"A taste for drawing and sketching was natural to me, and I turned my attention at
                  an early age to the improvement and cultivation of the little talent I possessed.
                  I practised the use of colors, and have come to be a very imperfect but devoted
                  artist. I am yet only a student, and a copyist. Manfred, my friend, has been more
                  than a brother to me. To his zeal and his aid, pecuniarily, I am deeply indebted
                  for my position and the little success I have enjoyed.</p>
               <p>"From fourteen to twenty years of age, he gave me the right hand of encouragement,
                  and I am at last placed on a footing that, until now, promised me fortune in the
                  future. If he has been taken away, I am alone, indeed!</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to add to this," continued Wilford, after a moments' silent grief.
                  "You know me, now, short as has been my story. I was born of poor parents, they
                  were removed by death before I had seen half a score of years, I aimed to become a
                  painter, I have struggled on, alone, until this hour, and I find myself under this
                  roof, indebted to your hospitality, sir—and your care, sweet Nelly, to an amount
                  that, I regret to add, I cannot repay!"</p>
               <p>"On that score, Wilford," responded Noell, "give yourself no uneasiness. Could we
                  have done less than to search for what we supposed (after discovering the wreck)
                  was a vessel that might contain human beings? After reaching<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000006"/> the shore, and hearing your groans, could we have
                  done less than to offer such succor as our positions enabled us to give, or such
                  attentions as the heart of humanity so naturally dictates? You give us too much
                  credit for a small service, that is easily requited. Your exhibition of gratitude
                  is sufficient. Under similar circumstances, I am sure you would have done quite as
                  much for us, or for others who might so unfortunately have been perilled. And now
                  for Manfred."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you will write to Dover, will you not, directly?" eagerly asked Wilford.</p>
               <p>"Most certainly I will. I am quite as anxious as yourself to learn if any tidings
                  have been had of your friends. It is now ten days since the accident occurred, and
                  ample time has elapsed to allow of their return to Dover, if they were rescued.
                  Besides this, I have no doubt it will be gratifying to him to learn of your
                  safety, if he survives."</p>
               <p>"You are right, my dear sir, in your estimate of his friendship for me. Pray
                  address him immediately. If he is able, he will come hither, at once, I am
                  certain."</p>
               <p>While Wilford slept, after this interview, Noell seated himself at the little
                  round deal table, and hastily penned the following epistle to—</p>

                           <p>"Sir—I am this moment put in possession of your address, under the
                              following painfully interesting circumstances.</p>
                           <p>"Ten days ago, I picked up, adrift, off Beachy Head Light, a yacht,
                              known as the <hi rend="i"/>Waif, and which I have just learned is your
                              property. Upon towing her to the beach, I discovered that she had been
                              dismasted, and I found the body of a young man on board, fastened
                              singularly to the side of the deck, by means of a fallen fragment of
                              the wreck, that caught his foot, and who was otherwise injured and
                              greatly exhausted.</p>
                           <p>"We secured your vessel, and afforded the young man such relief, then
                              and since, as our humble means would permit. He revived slowly, and
                              to-day we have for the first time heard him speak intelligibly. He
                              calls himself Alfred Wilford, and claims Mr Manfred for his friend. He
                              furnishes us with your address, and I write, by special messenger to
                              ask if you know him, and what shall be done with your property, if
                              this communication finds you. I pray you may have been so fortunate as
                              to have been saved without injury; and hoping this may reach you,
                              safely harbored, I am, in haste, yours, etc., etc.</p>

               <p>Noell proceeded immediately across the beach, some two leagues, to the nearest
                  house in his vicinity, where he found a courier whom he despatched with this
                  letter to Dover, with directions to search out the person to whom it was addressed
                  and to return, post haste, with such reply as he could obtain. All was
                  uncertainty, of course, for none of the parties at the light had the slightest
                  means of knowing whether any such person as Manfred could be found—or if he ever
                  existed, if he had escaped from the wreck.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, hope made the hearts of the light-keeper and his daughter buoyant.
                  They had been long conversant with similar scones of danger and mishap, and they
                  taught themselves to look at the bright side of events until the shadow of the
                  picture had become fact.</p>
               <p>The hours that passed from the time the despatch left the beach, until they could
                  hear from Dover, proved, as may well be supposed, a dreary and anxious period of
                  time. But Wilford was rapidly improving. His fever calmed, his bruises had healed
                  suddenly, and he recovered his faculties of body and mind in a brief space after
                  his consciousness fully returned. He detailed the unimportant events of his early
                  life to patient listeners, and, as he continued to improve, his benefactors became
                  more and more interested and pleased with his appearance and deportment.</p>
               <p>"And you tell me the messenger cannot return before to-morrow evening?" said
                  Wilford to Noell, on the day after he left.</p>
               <p>"Possibly, in the morning of to-morrow," said Noell; "but, if he did not find your
                  friend (or his representative) readily, after reaching town, there may be a delay
                  of a few hours in his return."</p>
               <p>"It is very tedious, sir, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"You are anxious, and so am I. But we must wait patiently. If Manfred has not
                  returned to Dover," continued Noell, looking at the chance of his loss, "if he is
                  gone—"</p>
               <p>"That is it—that is my fear," replied Wilford, feelingly. "Poor fellow! What a
                  night he must have passed, at best, after the accident!"</p>
               <p>"Was there no other craft in sight when the squall struck you?" asked the
                  light-keeper.</p>
               <p>"Not within hail. The weather had been fair, though we started from Calais with a
                  cracking breeze. Manfred was impulsive, and, in <emph>all</emph> his movements,
                  exceedingly self-relying. We suggested after dinner, I remember, that he was
                  carrying too much sail; and the small white cap-clouds that flitted across the
                  heavens after mid-day should have warned him of what we each of us felt satisfied,
                  that the wind was fitful and uneven, and at any moment a gust might injure us.
                  Before four o'clock, the wind shifted, and we were forced to beat up, as we
                  crossed the Straits. After running down, on the larboard tack, some hour or more,
                  we tacked again, and coming about the yacht mis-stayed, her sail backed, and at
                  that moment the gust struck her. The sea was running high, she pitched hard
                  forward, and we heard the crash of the falling mast. I knew but little more.
                  Manfred went off the stern, as we shrieked to him and to each other, my companions
                  disappeared, and night was fast coming on, when I found myself pinioned to the
                  deck—helpless and exhausted."</p>
               <p>"Yet you say there <emph>was</emph> a vessel in sight of you, at the time of the
                  disaster?" again asked Noell.</p>
               <p>"Not at the moment when the gale struck us, I think."</p>
               <p>"But, during the afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. A small brig, in our wake, perhaps three or four miles distant. When we took
                  the shock, the weather had come to be hazy, and the brig was astern of us, but not
                  in view, clearly."</p>
               <p>"Now there <emph>is</emph> hope, indeed!" exclaimed the light-keeper, cheerfully.
                  "The brig continued on her course, undoubtedly, and if your friends were
                  swimmers—unless they were crippled in some way—they might have sustained
                  themselves in the water for a long time, and the chances would be in favor of
                  their being picked up. Courage, Wilford! You have never told us of this before.
                  Your friends may yet be safe."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it be so," was Wilford's earnest prayer.</p>
               <p>"See, father! What is that?" shouted Nelly, at this moment, pointing to a most
                  unusual sight, down the beach, a mile from the house.</p>
               <p>A horse, at full gallop, was dashing towards the light-keeper's dwelling,
                  scrambling and tumling on among the rocks and hollows of the beach, at a
                  break-neck pace.</p>
               <p>"It is our messenger, from Dover," said Noell, instantly. "But that can hardly be.
                  Give me the glass, Nelly."</p>
               <p>He turned the telescope upon the advancing rider, and said:</p>
               <p>"No, it isn't him, at all events. I thought it improbable that he could have
                  arrived so quickly."</p>
               <p>"Who can it be?" queried Nelly.</p>
               <p>"Some accident has happened above the Point, I fear," added Noell. "But, here he
                  is, to explain his errand."</p>
               <p>The rider dashed up to the door of the light, sprang from his saddle, and throwing
                  the bridle over a corner of the fence, entered the house without ceremony, meeting
                  Noell near the threshold.</p>
               <p>"What has happened?" eagerly asked the latter.</p>
               <p>"Wilford, Wilford!" said the young horseman, impetuously—"is he here?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Manfred!</emph> My friend! Thank God—he <emph>is</emph> alive!" shouted the
                  invalid, wildly, as the side-door opened; and the next moment, the two friends
                  were fast locked in each other's arms!</p>
               <p>There was joy in the light-house, of Beachy Head that day, of a truth. And none
                  were happier than was Harry Noell and his kind-hearted daughter.</p>

               <head type="sub">MANFRED AND WILFORD.</head>
               <p>FOR some minutes after the mutual recognition, no word was spoken by a single
                  member of that astonished, joyful, enthusiastic group. Wilford did not doubt his
                  senses, this time, for he actually pressed to his heart the living form of his
                  dearest friend. But, when the first ebullition of grateful joy was over, he plied
                  his companion with queries so rapidly, without waiting for an answer to either of
                  his anxious inquiries, that Manfred couldn't keep pace with his impetuosity.</p>
               <p>"Tell me," said Wilford, "<emph>are</emph> you safe? Were you hurt? How were you
                  rescued? And Henry—Wallace—where are they? Were you long in peril? Did you see no
                  more of the <hi rend="i"/>Waif? Come, come, Manfred, this <emph>is</emph> joy
                  indeed! Tell us—tell my benefactors, here, all about the disaster. I forget—Noell,
                  this is my friend. Nelly, let me present you to Manfred. Ah, my boy, if you're
                  ever so unlucky—which Heaven <choice>
                     <sic>forefend</sic>
                     <corr>forfend</corr>
                  </choice>! if you are ever so unfortunate as to be cast adrift or ashore, as
                  helpless as I was, may you find a nurse like Nelly Noell, and as good a friend as
                  I have found herself and her father."</p>
               <p>Manfred shook the now extended hands of his new acquaintances right heartily; and
                  then in his careless, frank and natural manner, began from the
                  beginning—addressing himself now to Wilford, now to Nell, and then to her father,
                  in a recapitulation of the disaster and the final escape of himself and
                  companions.</p>
               <p>"Well, miboy," he said, "it's all over now—and, in one word, <emph>all</emph> of
                  us are safe and sound again. I say all, because I see that you are worth a score
                  of dead men. I am perfectly well, and the boys are both happy and hearty. So,
                  cheer up, once more. Wallace and Harry send all kinds of good greeting to you, and
                  they look for your early return to Dover, which I have promised them shall be
                  accomplished without unnecessary delay.</p>
               <p>"But, that <emph>was</emph> a blow though, to be sure!" he added.</p>
               <p>"You are right, Manfred. Didn't we caution you to reef, though? And didn't you
                  smile at Harry and me for what you were pleased to term our 'fresh-water
                  sailor-ism,' when old Boreas rattled down on our little craft like a fiery
                  tornado?"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, we escaped, miboy—and I was a little too confident, that's all."</p>
               <p>"We started from Calais," he continued, turning to Noell, "with a good seven-knot
                  breeze. But the wind changed, and we were forced to beat up the Channel. The boat
                  didn't come about as I anticipated, we missed stays, the squall struck us, and
                  directly we shipped a sea that knocked the timber out of us in a jiffy! All hands,
                  as I supposed, went by the board when the yachtheeled. I saw two of my companions,
                  but heard nothing of Wilford. However, it was too late to think of rendering
                  anybody else service, at that moment, and I struck out on my own account, as the
                  boat passed away, tumbling over the waves to windward, like a crushed eggshell, so
                  violent was the blow for half an hour."</p>
               <p>"You knew of the brig in your rear?" asked Noell.</p>
               <p>"I had noticed her two hours before; but the fog and haze was so thick that we
                  could discover nothing, then. Five minutes after we found ourselves in the water,
                  the yacht was out of sight, and I supposed she would sink, after the shifting of
                  her ballast."</p>
               <p>"But she righted," said Wilford.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but we knew (and I cared), very little about the boat, any way. Our lives
                  were worth swimming for, so <emph>we</emph> thought, and we breasted the waves
                  right earnestly, you may be sure. I tell you, Wilford, the boys swam like ducks!
                  But the game was unequal, and the odds were strongly against us. For choice, on my
                  part though I am not easily alarmed, I think I prefer some other bathing-spot that
                  I could name, to that of the middle of the Straits of Dover, in a hurricane!"</p>
               <p>"But how did you get out of your dilemma?"</p>
               <p>"O, easy enough, as it turned out. You know, Wilford, the old rhyme about the <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Good little cherub who sits up aloft,</l>
                        <l>To look out for the fate of poor Jack—'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I've heard you repeat it," said Wilford, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Well, I think the little fellow was close upon the track of the 'Waif' when she
                  went over; and I make no doubt he sent the good brig 'Flora' right into our wake,
                  for we soon descried her, and the trio of yells that we sent up were not lost in
                  the wind—though, as I said before, sir—it <emph>did</emph> blow, prodigiously.
                  Captain Blanche, God bless his good hearing and his good heart, lost no time in
                  coming to our assistance. He lowered away his boat and we were very soon safely
                  aboard his vessel. The brig lay to, for an hour, when the gale abated. He tacked
                  and filled till morning, in the hope of seeing the 'Waif' again—but she could not
                  be found, and we put away for Dover, with hearts grateful for our own
                  preservation, but deeply saddened by the thought that our friend Wilford had
                  become food for the sharks. As nothing further was heard of the yacht, I concluded
                  she had gone to the bottom! and, thanking my own lucky stars that I wasn't in her
                  to go down, also, I gave up all idea of possessing her again, or of hearing from
                  our missing associate—when your messenger, sir, found me, and brought me your
                  thrice welcome letter. I sprang to my feet, ordered horses, took a relay as often
                  as I could find it, and—here I am, miboy—give us your hand, once more!"</p>
               <p>Another general congratulation and shaking of hands followed this recital, for all
                  the parties present were very happy; and then Manfred inquired for the first time
                  about the yacht.</p>
               <p>"You say you towed her up, sir?"</p>
               <p>"She is moored close by the beach, below us, sir," said-Noell. "Shall we go and
                  look at her?"</p>
               <p>"Is she much injured?"</p>
               <p>"Very little, I think," replied the light-keeper. "Her mast is gone, the deck is
                  somewhat cracked, and the rigging is torn out, I find. But, with the exception of
                  these and the damage by the water that rushed into the cabin, she is as staunch
                  and sound as ever. Come, we will examine her."</p>
               <p>Wilford was unable to walk to the beach, and the other two proceeded to look at
                  the yacht. She lay snugly moored in a sort of creek that made up inland from the
                  shore of the beach, where she was out of the way of harm in, boisterous weather.
                  As had been suggested by Noell, little serious damage had been done to her,
                  excepting the breaking of the mast and its consequences, and Manfred was
                  astonished to find his little vessel in so good a condition. After removing to the
                  shore a few portable articles that were taken from the cabin and the lockers, they
                  returned again to the house.</p>
               <p>Roswell Manfred was the only child of Eaton Manfred, of Dover, England. He had
                  enjoyed a collegiate education, and was a young man of fair talents, good head and
                  affectionate disposition. The very large fortune which his father enjoyed afforded
                  the son a liberal allowance, and he was too well provided with the world's goods
                  to practise any profession. He kept a fine stud of horses, was a connoisseur in
                  pictures and sculpture, an excellent shot, an intrepid sportsman, and loved his
                  yacht to excess, though he was not a very skilful sailor. His attachments were
                  ardent and strong, and among his early and fast friends, young Wilford, a
                  penniless artist, ranked foremost. Roswell Manfred could appreciate a favor, at
                  its full value, great<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5956-00000008"/> or small, and those
                  who loved his friends he was sure to love in return.</p>
               <p>"What shall we do with the 'Waif'?" asked Noell, when they returned to the house,
                  and sat down to a lunch, prepared in their absence, by the attentive Nelly.</p>
               <p>"The yacht cost me two thousand pounds," replied Manfred. "I will have her
                  overhauled at once, and refitted—and when complete, again, I will present her,
                  with a thousand thanks, to Harry Noell, if he will accept the gift."</p>
               <p>This announcement took all by surprise, for no one anticipated any such
                  liberality.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said Noell, "this is too much! Really, I could not think of being
                  thus indebted—"</p>
               <p>"Indebted! Nonsense, man! Do you imagine that we don't know and feel where the
                  indebtedness lies? What you have done for my poor friend, here, you have done for
                  me. The yacht is yours, by right of salvage. You picked her up adrift at sea—and
                  the fitting her up, again, I claim as my right, in partial payment for your
                  kindness to Wilford. I shall insist upon this, without parley. And as for Nelly, I
                  will ask that when she marries, I may be permitted to add something to her dowry.
                  What say you, Noell?"</p>
               <p>"You are too kind, sir—but I will not oppose your handsome intentions," responded
                  the light-keeper, gratefully.</p>
               <p>The daughter blushed at the allusion to herself, but, as she had never before
                  heard the word "marriage" uttered, in connection with her own person, and as she
                  considered that event—if certain at all—at least very remote in its probable
                  consummation, she only bowed and thanked the gentleman for his generous
                  proffer.</p>
               <p>"And now, Wilford, miboy," continued his friend, "how do you feel about returning
                  to Dover? I notice that you are a little timber-toed, yet—but if we can manage to
                  get you across the Point, we can readily obtain a carriage, in which you can ride
                  home comfortably. What do you think?"</p>
               <p>"As you will, Manfred. I am doing very well here, I assure you. If, however, we
                  can get away, I have no doubt that Noell will gladly be relieved."</p>
               <p>"So I think; and to-morrow morning we will see how we can contrive it."</p>
               <p>Shelter was provided in the shed for Manfred's horse for the night, and the
                  new-made acquaintances separated, in the evening, for rest.</p>
               <p>There was no sleep, that night, however, for Nelly Noell! For the first time in
                  her life she was wretched. Whatever were her thoughts, or from whatever cause
                  arose this extraordinary disturbance in her hitherto uniformly content—it was
                  unknown, unmentioned to any living being.</p>
               <p>She arose in the morning, the breakfast was served, an additional horse had been
                  procured, and the two young men were ready at last to depart.</p>
               <p>"I am unable to add anything, pecuniarily, to the liberality of my friend
                  Manfred," said Wilford, as they were about to leave and addressing Noell, "but you
                  have my ardent gratitude, and will always have my prayers for your health and
                  prosperity. The time may come when I can do more than offer you these thankful
                  words. I shall not let slip my first opportunity." Then taking the little diamond
                  ring from his finger, he turned to the daughter, and added:</p>
               <p>"Nelly, to your kind solicitude and constant care, I am indebted too deeply, to
                  think of rewarding it. But, you will accept this trifle, I know, from me. It is of
                  small account, but it may serve to remind you of the poor artist, hereafter, when
                  he is far away from you. You will permit me to write to you, too—will you not,
                  sir?" he continued, turning to her father, who nodded his assent, "and I will tell
                  you of my success in the future. Take the ring, then—and with it the assurance of
                  my warm and constant remembrance."</p>
               <p>"A very pretty speech, to be sure!" ventured Manfred, disposed to check a tear
                  that he saw was starting—from the eye of no-matter-who! "Come, miboy, let's get
                  away."</p>
               <p>The parting was prolonged, but at length they said adieu. And, an hour afterwards,
                  the friends were comfortably ensconced in an ample travelling chaise, on the road
                  to Dover.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">A HOME OF WEALTH AND EASE.</head>
               <p>BURTON HOUSE, the residence of Mr. Manfred, Sen'r., was a princely estate. It was
                  located a short distance back from the seashore, on the outskirts of Dover, and
                  every element of luxury and beauty and utility found its appropriate place in the
                  grounds and mansion of its wealthy proprietor.</p>
               <p>The wide domain that circled the dwellings comprised an extended area of acres,
                  over which were tastefully laid out clean hard gravelled roads, which wound
                  through a variety of scenery, for miles in length—affording beautiful drives for
                  the high mettled steeds belonging to the estate, which were constantly abroad, in
                  fine weather, for the recreation of the family and their numerous visitors.</p>
               <p>A beautiful lake upon the "Great Hill," in the rear of the grounds furnished an
                  ample supply of water for a myriad of fountains and jets that were placed in
                  various portions of the grounds and terraces. Artificial ponds, rare statuary, and
                  elegantly filled parterres were seen at various points. A splendid park, with its
                  groves and clumps of trees, its streams and pleasant vales, skirted the southerly
                  side, for a long distance, over which bounded a hundred noble deer. There was no
                  lack of the useful or ornamental, the artificial or natural, the artistic or the
                  fanciful, to render "Burton House" a magnificent and princely home, a retreat of
                  wealth and comfort and ease. And here, amid the continuous rounds of pleasure and
                  enjoyment that characterize the home of the gentleman of pride and leisure—the
                  proprietor dwelt, surrounded by a retinue of friends and acquaintances who kept
                  the establishment of servants, attaches, horses and hounds in full employment,
                  throughout the entire year.</p>
               <p>To this home, by invitation of young Manfred, the artist Wilford was now being
                  borne, after his rescue and temporary illness at the light-keeper's humble abode.
                  He had visited Burton House before this, and, at the time of the accident, he was
                  on a visit to his friend, who took him out to Calais on the pleasure trip which so
                  nearly cost him his life. Roswell Manfred had proved a dutiful son, and he was so
                  well beloved by his father, and his parent confided so implicitly in his only
                  child that he was as much the master at Burton House as if the estate were his
                  own, with all attached to it.</p>
               <p>Nor did he abuse his father's indulgence and princely liberality towards him. No
                  son had ever entertained a deeper feeling of veneration and love for a parent than
                  did the youth of whom we are writing. The confidence and the affection were mutual
                  between them; and the boy was permitted unlimited use of his rich father's<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5956-00000009"/> very lengthy purse. He lived
                     <unclear>extravagantly</unclear>, in consequence—but the old gentleman was wont
                  to say, when some careful friend would suggest that Roswell was living too
                  fast—"well, I allow him two thousand pounds a year, for his private purse, and I
                  cheerfully pay all his bills, beside, as fast as they are presented. If that wont
                  keep him up, why—<emph>I must give him more!</emph>"</p>
               <p>At the close of a fine clear day, a strange carriage came slowly up the great
                  avenue that terminated at the front terrace, from which there alighted the two
                  young men whom we last met at the light-keeper's dwelling. Manfred had reached
                  home safely with Wilford, who was now quite recovered, and who was only a little
                  weak from the effects of his late accident and fever. As the recognized friend of
                  his son, Mr. Manfred, Senior, greeted the new-comer cordially, and bade him a
                  hearty welcome, again, to the pleasures and hospitalities of Burton House.</p>
               <p>"I shall require you to rest awhile, now," said the good old gentleman, kindly;
                  "and no more yachting, boys, at present, do you hear?"</p>
               <p>This caution was hardly necessary. They had quite enough of sea life to suffice
                  them, for the season, at least.</p>
               <p>The interior of Burton House, proper, was furnished and appointed in a style of
                  elegance fully equal to the splendid fortune of its owner. The drawing and
                  reception rooms—the great parlors and spacious dining hall—the picture gallery and
                  library, all were superbly finished and decorated throughout. Old Manfred's income
                  was immense, and, like the "fine old English gentleman," that he was, he spared no
                  means no cost, to render his establishment worthy of its wide-spread fame.</p>
               <p>Within a week from the day of Wilford's arrival, a party of Londoners came down to
                  make an old-style visit at Burton House. Servants, horses, carriages, hunters,
                  dogs—all the appliances of enjoyment at the old mansion, were forth-with put in
                  requisition for the entertainment of the guests, and a glorious time was in
                  prospect.</p>
               <p>Among the young ladies who formed a portion of this party was one Charlotte
                  Simplon—to whom we must devote a paragraph, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                     passant</foreign>.</p>
               <p>This lady was exceedingly fair to look upon, and her general manner was
                  attractive. She belonged to a family of decayed nobility, and had only a
                     <emph>name</emph> to subsist on. She was the heir to a moderate fortune, in
                  prospective, however—and, being under the protection of a rich uncle, who favored
                  her, evidently, she did not lack admirers in plenty. But Miss Simplon was a
                  butterfly—a heartless, spoiled coquette—beautiful in form and features, but
                  aristocratic in all her ideas, and scornfully proud to the last degree. She came
                  to Burton House to make a conquest. She had met with young Manfred, and she had
                  ascertained his <emph>pecuniary</emph> value!</p>
               <p>Young Wilford was struck with her beauty, and before he realized the consequences,
                  or the importance of the step, he acknowledged to Manfred, junior, that he thought
                  her an angel.</p>
               <p>"She's a little flighty, miboy," replied his friend. "She soars in a region that
                  you will scarcely reach, I think."</p>
               <p>"Is she rich?" asked Wilford.</p>
               <p>"No. She has some expectation, I hear, when some old aunt pops off; and I believe
                  her uncle, who is with her, thinks her a saint; he is wealthy and <emph>may
                     die</emph> at some time or other; though, by Jove! he looks very little like it
                  now—to be sure," continued Manfred, pointing to a fine robust gentleman of fifty,
                  who sat upon the lawn after a sumptuous dinner, enjoying the evening, shade and
                  air.</p>
               <p>Manfred rallied his friend upon his confession, and endeavored to dissuade him
                  from thinking farther of the risky beauty. This only added fuel to the flame, and
                  Wilford secretly determined upon pushing his pretensions further. He was charmed
                  with Miss Simplon's manner and conversation, and was soon found in her train of
                  admirers, a prominent and seemingly well-favored gallant.</p>
               <p>Party succeeded party—balls and routs and rides, by night and day, filled up the
                  entire time of the guests, and a more brilliant season never was passed at Burton
                  House. In the midst of all this round of pleasure, Wilford was constantly brought
                  into contact with Miss Simplon, who entranced him, infatuated him, completely. Her
                  shafts were aimed at young Manfred, and she attempted through his acknowledged
                  friend, to reach the heart (or the hand, at least), of the youthful millionaire.
                  But Roswell treated her with civility and courteous hospitality, only; he
                  entertained not the slightest fancy for such a being, and she saw with
                  mortification that her attempt to ensnare <emph>that</emph> bird was a signal
                  failure.</p>
               <p>The surprise and chagrin of young Wilford may be hardly imagined, however, when,
                  upon a chance opportunity, as the guests were about to return to London, he
                  ventured during their garden stroll to take the hand of Miss Simplon in his own,
                  and hint to her his passion.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sir!</emph>" she exclaimed, as she scornfully drew back her delicate
                  fingers, and cast upon Wilford a gaze of affected astonishment, "you really are
                  not serious!"</p>
               <p>The artist declared his love, notwithstanding this rebuff.</p>
               <p>"Then, sir," she continued, "you do not know me;" and leaving the young man to
                  unravel these few rather expressive words, as she deemed them, the coquette passed
                  quickly to the mansion, unattended.</p>
               <p>"Laura," she said to her confidante, at evening, "who do you imagine knelt to me,
                  to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Charlotte, I cannot divine, you are so constantly surrounded with
                  suitors. Was it Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Miss Simplon, "it was <emph>not</emph> Manfred."</p>
               <p>"Who, then?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that insignificant friend of his—the young painter."</p>
               <p>"Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the beauty, contemptuously.</p>
               <p>"And what did you say to him, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Say? Nothing. I deemed him entirely beneath notice. When he told me he had dared
                  to love me, I said '<emph>Sir!</emph>' and left him kneeling among the violets. He
                  has neither name, nor fortune."</p>
               <p>"But his talent is acknowledged, I hear."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Laura. He is a dependant on Manfred's bounty. I was surprised at his
                  presumption, though it cannot annoy me."</p>
               <p>The following day the party broke up, and the Londoners departed. Wilford was
                  pensive and thoughtful, but he kept his disappointment a secret.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE REJECTED SUITOR.</head>
               <p>ALFRED WILFORD had been too sanguine and too self-confident, in his estimation of
                  his own position and attractions. The dashing, ambitious Miss Simplon had no idea
                  of "sacrificing" herself, as she was pleased to term it, to the questionable
                  charge of a poor artist who had neither name, fame, nor gold! Her aim was higher;
                  and, though she had led Wilford on by means of her flirting and coquetry, and
                  encouraged him to propose, in order that she might boast of another victim to her
                  proud caprice, she utterly flouted the idea of receiving him as a suitor for her
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Laura," she added, surveying her handsome form and attractive face in the
                  large mirror of her boudoir, "if he were a Von Bunn, a Matricio, or even a
                  Hurst—anybody who was known in the world, I might favor him, for really he is not
                  a bad-looking man, and converses charmingly. But a Simplon would hardly answer for
                  the wife of a poverty-stricken artist, eh?"</p>
               <p>"You will scarcely be troubled with importunity from him, I judge," replied her
                  friend. "He has shown too much spirit for that, already."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Spirit!</emph> Spirit in a poor painter! Why, Laura, I repeat it, Wilford
                  is a dependant upon young Manfred, who buys his pictures—or whatever they can be
                  called—for the sake of keeping the poor fellow's head above water, but who is
                  aware, notwithstanding his continuous charity, that the young man has very little
                  real talent."</p>
               <p>"I think you are in error on this point," replied Laura. "I have heard Mr. Manfred
                  remark that he had produced some very fine pictures; and the Duchess of Glenville
                  has contracted with him, lately, for her portrait, I know."</p>
               <p>"The duchess! Are you sure of this?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes. Her first lady-in-waiting informed me of it, a week since."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I did not know of this, before—for Wilford has asked me, repeatedly,
                  to sit to him for my picture."</p>
               <p>"And you remember the handsome Lord Tuttleham, whom we encountered at Bath?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly well; and a charming gentleman he is, too."</p>
               <p>"He is the brother-in-law of the duchess, you know?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a gentleman of fortune."</p>
               <p>"He, too, has ordered a picture of Wilford, recently. So that I think you will
                  allow that he must have a degree of talent, in his way—for both her highness and
                  the Tuttlehams are really acknowledged connoisseurs."</p>
               <p>"I was very well pleased, Laura, with his lordship, and he treated me with
                  exceedingly gracious politeness. I will sit to Wilford for <emph>my</emph>
                  portrait. It may prove of advantage—<emph>to the young artist, I mean,</emph>" she
                  quickly added.</p>
               <p>Wilford sat in his studio, at Dover, a few days after this conversation, engaged
                  upon finishing up the elaborately painted drapery over the bust of the Duchess of
                  Glenville's picture, who had honored him by sitting for her portrait. It was a
                  very capital likeness, the coloring was without fault, and Lord Tuttleham had just
                  given his opinion that it was admirably executed, when a rapping at the door was
                  heard.</p>
               <p>"Come in," said Wilford.</p>
               <p>A liveried servant entered, and handed the artist a note, which ran as
                  follows:</p>

                           <p>"MR. WILFORD: You were polite enough to hint that you would like me to
                              sit to you for my portrait. Let me know when it will be convenient
                              ient and agreeable to you to call on me, for its commencement.</p>
                           <p>"I hope you have recovered from your little fit of passion, lately

               <p>This was a pretty piece of mockery for young Wilford! He could not comprehend
                  it—but his mind had been previously made up in regard to the aristocratic Miss
                  Simplon.</p>
               <p>"It is all right," said Wilford, to the servant, after a moment's reflection.
                  "There is no reply."</p>
               <p>The servant bowed himself out, and returned to his mistress.</p>
               <p>"Where is your answer to the note?" she inquired.</p>
               <p>"The gentleman read it, and said 'there is no reply.'"</p>
               <p>It was now Wilford's turn. As soon as he found leisure, the next day, he forwarded
                  the annexed epistle to <q>

                                 engaged up to this hour, of late, in completing orders for a few
                                 pictures for her grace the Duchess of Glenville, my Lord Tuttleham,
                                 Mr. Manfred and others, who honored me with calls. I am now about
                                 to leave England for the Continent, and shall not be able to attend
                                 to the commission proposed in yours of yesterday. Respectfully,</p>

               </p>
               <p>The artist took care that this missive should find its way to Miss Simplon at an
                  early hour, and having despatched it, he felt relieved.</p>
               <p>He had really determined, however, to quit his present place of abode, with the
                  design of visiting the schools of France and Germany, and to pass a few years,
                  perhaps, in Italy, among the old masters. He would take out commissions from
                  Manfred and other friends for several copies and originals, and he resolved to
                  earn a name, or never return to his native isle.</p>
               <p>Manfred had already sent to Beachy Head for the yacht, which had been brought up
                  and docked for refitting. New rigging, a fresh suit of sails, and all the
                  necessary accompaniments of furniture, etc., were put aboard, and when in complete
                  trim once more, she was launched again, to be sent back to her new owner.</p>
               <p>"Will you join us?" said Manfred to Wilford, when the boat was finally in
                  readiness.</p>
               <p>"Whither?"</p>
               <p>"A trip down the coast."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you, miboy! No more boating for me."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! We are only going down to the light."</p>
               <p>"What light?"</p>
               <p>"Beachy Head—come along."</p>
               <p>Nelly was there—an accomplished skipper had been engaged to pilot the "Waif" to
                  her destination—Wilford was not opposed to visiting his friends, there—the weather
                  was fine—he was no coward—he consented to go, upon Manfred's urgent
                  solicitation.</p>
               <p>An exceedingly pleasant voyage was that of the little party on this occasion. A
                  fair wind met them in the channel, and they passed down the coast in gallant style
                  from the outset, without change of tack or sheet. A small swivel gun upon the bow
                  of the "Waif" had been loaded for the purpose, and upon arriving abreast of the
                  light-house, at nearly sunset, the sharp report it gave out, upon being
                  discharged, aroused the occupants of the dwelling very quickly.</p>
               <p>The English ensign was waving from the peak, a neat streamer flaunted out from her
                  truck, and the yacht never looked prettier than she did at the moment when she
                  hove-to under the high rock that jutted out into the sea, below old Noell's
                  dwelling.</p>
               <p>A light dory, occupied by two persons from the shore, quickly put out from the
                  beach to receive the company, or to answer any questions that might be put,
                  when—as the boat came within hailing distance—Harry Noell and Nelly were
                  discovered, and three hearty ringing cheers went up from the lungs of the yacht
                  company, for the light-keeper and his handsome daughter.</p>
               <p>The greeting was cordial, on both sides. Noell was very agreeable—Nelly looked
                  beautiful as ever—Wilford was full of gratitude and compliments—and Manfred was
                  happy as a lord, because he saw everybody else so contented and joyful. The late
                  owner of the "Waif" delivered her over to Noell, formally, and horses were
                  directly ordered, by means of a neighbor who came down in the morning, and was now
                  returning across the beach, to convey the little company homeward. A bottle of
                  Hockheimer was circulated, health and long life to Noell and his daughter was
                  drank, in brimming bumpers, and the parties separated, to meet no more for many
                  years, if ever!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">PARIS.</head>
               <p>SOME enthusiastic visitor to the most brilliant capitol in Europe, upon the first
                  impressions he conceived after his arrival there, wrote home, in one line, "<hi
                     rend="i"/>See Paris, and die!"</p>
               <p>How far such performance and such a consequence might be agreeable to other people
                  who go there, is an "open question," decidedly. We rather incline to the opinion,
                  however, that the majority of travellers upon the Continent now-a-days, will
                  rather exclaim—"See Paris, and <emph>live!</emph>"</p>
               <p>At any rate, such was Alfred Wilford's idea when he found himself at the gay city
                  alluded to, a few weeks after the events set down in our last chapter. He had
                  relinquished all hope of acquiring a fortune, at home, and through the aid of
                  Manfred and a few of his friends, he was able to travel, and to begin to try the
                  world upon his own account.</p>
               <p>But he had other cogent reasons for leaving England. His pride of heart had been
                  hurt. He knew he had been reckless in approaching Charlotte Simplon, for he now
                  saw how hollow were her pretensions to admiration—not to speak of the
                     <emph>love</emph> of a high-minded man. But, if he lived, he was determined to
                  be avenged for the contumely she had thrown upon him, when he was utterly
                  defenceless. He flattered himself that Miss Simplon would live long enough, too,
                  to see the difference, perhaps, between simple glitter and solid gold.</p>
               <p>The season was unusually gay and spirited, and Paris was never seen to better
                  advantage than at the time of Wilford's arrival. An enthusiast in his profession,
                  the young man had come to a field where his pencil could find ample
                  occupation—whether he chose to sketch from the hurried world around him, or to
                  pass his hours in quiet at the Louvre or the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Acadamie des
                     Arts</foreign>. And he sat down with the determination of availing himself of
                  the advantages that surrounded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Paris!</emph> Paris—the cradle of fashion and folly, the resort of polished
                  gamblers, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roues</foreign>, and spendthrift ladies, the
                  home, at once, of gorgeous wealth and wretched poverty. Paris, swarming with
                  adventurers, beggars, princes, potentates, and travellers from every nation under
                  the sun. Paris, with its revolutions, its barricades, its compromises, and its
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille</foreign>. Paris, with its Eden of beautiful
                  women and ugly men, its magnificent theatres, its palaces, its hovels, its virtue
                  and its crimes—a garden of art and beauty and refinement, and a den of intrigue,
                  corruption and woe—the Paris of the world, where literature, science and
                  statesmanship abound, the gayest or the most sombre city of the universe. Paris,
                  the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau ideal</foreign> of Wilford's imagination, was now
                  his abiding-place. His journey was at an end—so he then thought, and he went to
                  work with a hearty good will in the prosecution of his good intentions.</p>
               <p>All day he studied at his easel, and he realized the benefit of thorough
                  systematic application. When evening came, it was his custom to stroll along the
                  Boulevards, or wander through the crowded thoroughfares and gardens, where he met
                  with much to entertain or instruct him. He had been in Paris a fortnight, when as
                  he was returning one evening to his lodgings, over the Pont des Fleurs, at a
                  somewhat later hour than usual, he suddenly heard footsteps directly behind him,
                  on the bridge. He was just turning about, when a hand touched him and a gentle
                  female voice said:</p>
               <p>"A few sous, for bread!"</p>
               <p>This kind of beggary was so common in the public highways that Wilford turned
                  away, and would have passed on, but the hand detained him, gently, and
                  repeated:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur! For God's sake, give me money to save my starving mother."</p>
               <p>Wilford halted, hesitated; for the appeal seemed to his ear all too genuine to be
                  disregarded.</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?" he inquired, as he placed his hand upon his but lightly
                  filled purse.</p>
               <p>"In the fauborg St. Germain, Rue Catalan."</p>
               <p>"I will go with you, and see your sick mother."</p>
               <p>"No, no! It is too far away. I will run to her alone, but pray vouchsafe me a few
                  sous."</p>
               <p>"And do you thus obtain your subsistence?"</p>
               <p>"Partly thus and partly by weary labor with my needle."</p>
               <p>"Do you come hither often, my girl?"</p>
               <p>"Never but once before to-night, monsieur."</p>
               <p>"Here are five francs. Meet me again, at evening, on the day after to-morrow, and
                  tell me if I can serve you further."</p>
               <p>The girl hurried quickly away, and Wilford returned to his lodgings in deep
                  thought. The tone of voice, the delicacy of the girl's manner, the novelty of the
                  trifling adventure, served to interest him. He might have been deceived, but he
                  felt that he had done a good action, and he slept more quietly, he believed, than
                  if he had passed the beggar by without notice.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, the young artist had occasion to open a small port-folio
                  that he had not previously needed for some time, and which contained some sketches
                  which he had taken while at home. As he turned down one of the pockets of this
                  book, an envelope fell upon the floor. Upon taking it up, he found it addressed to
                  himself, in a delicate hand that he had never seen before, and he quickly opened
                  it to read the following lines:</p>
               <p>"Upon the poorest soil, may occasionally be found, in a state of nature, the most
                  delicate and rarest of plants. In the quiet valley, unseen and uncared-for by the
                  passer-by, the modest lily rears her head, and blooms and dies unnoticed. Among
                  the humblest denizens of society, there be those who could rival the beauty and
                  stateliness of the queens of the earth, were the opportunity afforded them in
                  comparison. Virtue and innocence are Heaven's gifts, and should outshine the
                  glitter and tinsel of artificial worth.</p>
               <p>"You will read these lines, Wilford, sooner or later, but will you confide in
                  their truth? At least, you will not deem them obtrusive. They are penned at the
                  moment of parting by one who is not ashamed to acknowledge that she—" and this was
                  all!</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," said Wilford, reading the curious document over again, "this is
                  really <emph>very</emph> Frenchy."</p>
               <p>How it came in the port-folio, who wrote it, how long it had been there, he was
                  entirely at a loss to determine. But what its termination should have been, or
                  rather what was intended to be conveyed by the last unfinished sentence, was the
                  most inexplicable of all; "not ashamed to acknowledge that she—"
                     <emph>what!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Who was <emph>'she'?</emph> What '<emph>parting</emph>' did it refer to? How
                  could any one have found access to his private sketch-book?"</p>
               <p>Wilford asked these questions, over and over again, but he could not find replies
                  for them. Was it Miss Simplon? <emph>No</emph>. Could it have been Nelly?
                     <emph>No</emph>. Who then? and to whom would the sentiments apply? The youth
                  was completely in the dark.</p>
               <p>Prompt to his appointment, Wilford was present under the arches of the Pont des
                  Fleurs, on the evening agreed upon. He had been tarrying full an hour without
                  meeting the object of his solicitude, and was about to return to his hotel when he
                  suddenly encountered the figure, as he judged by the dress, of the looked-for
                  beggar.</p>
               <p>"You have come, then; I had given you up."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am here at the earliest moment possible."</p>
               <p>"And your mother?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, sir! your kindness has removed a load of<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000012"/> trouble from my heart; I shall now be able to get
                  on very well; for since I saw you last, I have found employment that will serve to
                  supply our wants. I come to thank you, with all my heart, and to say, adieu!"</p>
               <p>"But you will tell me your name, and allow me to—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Marie</emph>. Take this, pardon me, to-night. Read it, and you will be
                  enlightened. Farewell!"</p>
               <p>The beggar was gone; and Wilford stood alone upon the bridge, holding in his hand
                  a small packet, with which he hurried to his lodgings, as soon as he recovered
                  from his astonishment. Upon opening the letter, he was instantly struck with the
                  similarity of hand-writing to that of the mysterious communication he had found in
                  his port-folio, and which ran as follows:</p>
               <p>"Wilford, you may have met with a hand-writing resembling this, before. At any
                  rate, believe that <emph>a friend</emph> who watches you most earnestly, and who
                  would give her life to aid you, is the author of this note. You must not know her
                  at present. You have a duty to perform for yourself that she cannot interrupt or
                  interfere with. Bear in mind, only, that she is near you, and will care for you
                  when others slight, annoy or deceive you. You cannot guess her whereabouts, you
                  cannot learn whence she comes, or why she thus regards you, at present. Time alone
                  will develope to you, satisfactorily, whether she is worthy of your remembrance
                  and regard. Pursue the objects which induced you to visit this land, which is not
                  your home. <emph>Deserve</emph> the fame you seek, and fortune awaits you in the
                  future. You will hear from her, again—and when you least expect it. Go forward!
                  And bear in constant remembrance the beggar—<emph>Marie</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Who wouldn't dwell in Paris!" exclaimed the artist, as he carefully refolded this
                  delicately traced note, and placed it in his sketch-book. "Here <emph>is</emph> a
                  plot, to be sure!"</p>
               <p>Then comparing the two letters together, he felt sure that the same hand had
                  traced them both, though he could not, for the life of him, decide upon who the
                  author could possibly be.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">N'importe!</foreign>" he cried, at last; "she will
                  undoubtedly prove my 'good angel,' for I think such beings may dwell even in
                  wicked, turbulent, curious Paris. We may meet, perhaps, milady, hereafter."</p>
               <p>And like a true philosopher, content with what he knows, when he can learn no
                  more, our hero extinguished his light, and retired to dream of Marie, the beggar
                  girl of the Pont des Fleurs!</p>

               <head type="sub">A MYSTERIOUS VISIT.</head>
               <p>HARRY NOELL was the richest man in his vicinity—where there were no others, for
                  miles!—and, with his beautiful yacht, so admirably appointed, he wouldn't have
                  been wealthier, so he thought, if he could have been just as well as not. He was
                  fully contented prior to his coming into possession of this appropriate and pretty
                  piece of property, but now he felt as rich as a lord. He had placed the
                  light-house in charge of a friend, and embarking with his daughter, he crossed the
                  Straits to Calais, and was absent from home three weeks, an unusual adventure in
                  his experience, and affording Nelly a peep at the world away from Beachy Head for
                  the first time in her life. On the day they returned to the light-house, after
                  this excursion, there came to their dwelling two strangers, of respectable
                  appearance, with a view, so they said, to examine the buildings and the coast in
                  the immediate vicinity, on behalf of the government. Indeed they exhibited letters
                  signed by British officials which satisfied Noell that all was right.</p>
               <p>"We shall be engaged here a month, probably," they said, "and we shall want a
                  little more roomy accommodations than your house affords, Mr. Noell."</p>
               <p>The premises were thoroughly examined, and it was at length agreed that an
                  addition should be made, in the rear of the light, to the shed attached to the
                  house. A supply of stone was readily found upon the beach and among the crags, and
                  workmen were at once set about putting up the enlargement required—while the two
                  strangers went, or pretended to go, up and down the long beach, for the purpose of
                  making such philosophical observations as their instructions from the government
                  required. In a few days, the place was finished to their satisfaction, being made
                  wind and water proof, the laborers were paid off in good bright English gold, and
                  the new-comers, Captain Stark and Lieutenant Brace, R. N., took possession, and
                  housed their implements and the instruments used in their calling.</p>
               <p>It turned out that a secret commission had been ordered in this case; and a letter
                  came down in the mail, which was sent over to the light, subsequently, addressed
                  to Noell, informing him of the fact, and signed by the naval secretary, at London.
                  Acting under this order, every facility within the light-keeper's knowledge or
                  reach was freely tendered to the two strangers, in order that they might be aided
                  in carrying out the designs of the government, to the fullest extent.</p>
               <p>Matters proceeded quietly along, and no unnecessary questions were asked by either
                  party. The two men ate at the light-keeper's table, paid him roundly in bright
                  gold for all his attentions, and were continually busy. Whenever<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000013"/> they left their lodging-place, however, they were
                  exceedingly cautious about securing the door, lest intruders, or perhaps the
                  light-keeper or his daughter, should stroll into the premises. There was only one
                  small window, high up in the end of this newly constructed apartment, which
                  afforded but a meagre light; but this appeared sufficient for their purpose.</p>
               <p>After a few days, their rambles on the seashore and up the beach were pretty much
                  discontinued, and at the expiration of a fortnight they had ascertained all they
                  wished for <emph>outside</emph> of the building. During the next four days, maps
                  and charts and drawings were exhibited and consulted by the two men, in presence
                  of the family, and the captain found it necessary to go up to the nearest port
                  village for materials that he needed, and then for letters; and then the
                  lieutenant was called away to town, and he took his large trunk with him and
                  brought it back again. And thus they managed for ten days longer, one or the other
                  of the twain visiting the village, daily, and constantly carrying away luggage and
                  returning with instruments, rolls of parchment, and other matters that they seemed
                  to use in the prosecution of their instructions from the government.</p>
               <p>Harry Noell was not a man to indulge idle curiosity. But the whole deportment of
                  the strangers, their determined secrecy and the length of time they occupied in
                  consultation, or whatever it was, within doors, under lock, in that barren and
                  uninhabited place, the extraordinary caution that marked all their movements, when
                  it appeared to him there could be no possible need of it, in that place; all these
                  things served to arouse his suspicions, finally, that there was something wrong in
                  the whole affair. He had no time to write to London to ascertain anything in that
                  quarter, and so he determined to satisfy himself, as best he could, at the very
                  first convenient opportunity.</p>
               <p>Within four-and-twenty hours after Noell had thus resolved, both the captain and
                  the lieutenant started for the post-village. They had about completed their
                  business, so they informed the light-keeper, and would return with horses, as
                  quickly as possible, for the final removal of their luggage, trunks, boxes and
                  tools. As soon as they were out of sight by his telescope, he prepared a skeleton
                  key, with which, after a deal of trouble and delay, he effected an entrance into
                  the hitherto secret apartments of the strangers. Within the door, there was placed
                  a high, rough screen, to prevent all observation from without while the door was
                  open. When Noell got fairly inside, he was astounded!</p>
               <p>A huge pile of earth had been thrown up from the centre of the spot that had
                  recently been covered by the additional building, and a deep cavity appeared
                  below, like a well, which had been dug out since the addition had been erected.
                  Across the side of the ground floor, towards the wall, another opening had been
                  made, and then still another at right angles from this, as if a search had been
                  made within the new enclosure, below the surface of the ground.</p>
               <p>Noell continued to look around the trenches, and soon encountered a large and
                  antiquated solid oaken chest, and then another, and then two or three iron-bound
                  smaller ones. Evidently all these had been dug out of the earth, there! The
                  strangers brought no such luggage with them to the light-house, and he would have
                  known it had such cumbrous articles arrived there since. The character of the
                  mystery became more and more complicated, at every turn and during every moment
                  that he tarried to examine into it.</p>
               <p>A portion of the trenches had been filled up, plainly. That is to say, it was
                  clear that other places had been dug out, and filled in again, from
                  disappointment, or other cause. The chests having been evidently found on his
                  premises, he at once made up his mind that the right belonged to him to know what
                  they contained—a very natural conclusion, by the way.</p>
               <p>Upon looking a little farther, however, he discried seven large jars, or vases, of
                  antique models, that were carefully sealed up and were partially covered by
                  freshly dug earth and gravel. These were very heavy, and Noell began to believe
                  that an immense treasure had been found here, through some outside agency
                  directing the two men to this particular spot. At first, from his natural good
                  common sense, he was disinclined to entertain any such idea as that he—Harry
                  Noell—the poor light-house-keeper, who had known nought but toil and hardship from
                  his infancy, could fall upon any such seeming god-send as this appeared to
                  indicate. But he gave himself little time to reflect, for the hour when his two
                  strange guests would return was rapidly approaching. In his excitement he knocked
                  off the top of one of the vases, and there rolled out upon the ground a mass of
                  large-sized coins!</p>
               <p>They were tarnished and uneven in color. Were they copper? He grasped a handful of
                  them, nervously, examined them hastily—they were clearly gold! Harry Noell was not
                  usually an excitable man. But he was thunderstruck at this development.</p>
               <p>Without stopping a moment to reflect upon consequences, Noell seized an axe, and
                  knocked the lid from one of the chests. He found it filled to the top with
                  irregular heavy bars, that he took for lead, or composition metal. They were solid
                  silver! He tried another, and the result was the same. What should he do? It was
                  getting late, the "captain" and his "lieutenant" would soon return. They had gone
                  in search of horses to remove what they called their "luggage," and before morning
                  the treasure would vanish. What he did must be done quickly.</p>
               <p>And now he began to see light. These men were no government employees. They were
                  adventurers, robbers or pirates, perhaps—who had learned of the existence of this
                  property, or, peradventure had been privy to its secretion at some time
                  previously. To whomsoever it might of right belong, they had no claim to it, in
                  his estimation. What could he do, under the circumstances, to protect it?</p>
               <p>Nelly was ignorant of the discovery, of course; he was otherwise alone, in a
                  lonely place, and there were two to one, in the event of any controversy or
                  conflict in regard to its detention. The men who could so coolly plan a scheme to
                  obtain the possession of this property, and who had gone so far towards securing
                  it, would not stop at any means to consummate intentions and wishes. Besides this,
                  it was something to contend for, to be sure!</p>
               <p>All these thoughts, and more, rushed through the mind of the light-keeper while he
                  gazed upon the harvest before him, and in a much less space of time than it has
                  required to record the facts. Suddenly his eye rested upon one or two pieces of
                  stained and ancient-looking parchment. He took them up, and found a sort of plan
                  or drawing of a promontory and a beach—with markings for two or three ledges,
                  outside. Then there were figures and characters of which he knew nothing, that
                  indicated certain spots upon the bluff mentioned. In short, the map, or whatever
                  it was, proved to be a very accurate representation of the location of the
                  light-house and its neighborhood, at Beachy Head. The other paper was a sort of
                  communication, or direction, explanatory of the first one, and contained the
                  following curious advice, written in irregular German text.</p>
               <p>"In ye side drawback ov ye escritoire, over ye backe, wille be found a paquet ov
                  browne pappers. In ye firste ov theese, are written ye pointes ov ye cumpas wich
                  wille gide you to ye beech. On ye high rock wich pointes tu see, tu ye easte,

                  come belowe. T. * O O."</p>
               <p>This was all Greek to Harry Noell, but it was evident that from this and the
                  charts mentioned, the men had found the precise spot where the treasure lay
                  concealed. Lost in his thoughts for a moment, and unable to decide what course he
                  should take next, he lingered, gazing on the precious display, when the sound of
                  voices startled him—but riveted him to the spot where he stood. He was caught!
                  There was no escape, it was too late to retreat!</p>
               <p>"What's this!" yelled the captain, coming quickly to the door, as he saw it
                  half-open. "By Jove, we're discovered!"</p>
               <p>Backed by the lieutenant, the gallant captain in his majesty's navy dashed into
                  the apartment, and stood astounded, speechless, upon confronting the light-keeper,
                  alone in the middle of the floor!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SCENE AND ITS RESULTS.</head>
               <p>THE chagrin of the strangers was paralleled only by the firmness and gallant
                  bearing of the hardy light-keeper. He was used to peril, and he knew nothing about
                  flinching in an emergency.</p>
               <p>"Stand!" cried the captain, in a voice of thunder, and at the same moment
                  presenting a pistol close to Noell's head. "If you move one inch from your tracks,
                  you are a dead man!"</p>
               <p>This was a very emphatic but not a very interesting piece of information to Harry,
                  just at that moment, for he really believed that the alarmed villain meant exactly
                  what he said.</p>
               <p>"Stand! echoed the lieutenant, fiercely, "for if his pistol misses you, I'll find
                  your brain with this!" and another muzzle was levelled directly in his eye.</p>
               <p>Noell was unarmed and helpless. So he did not move from "his tracks," but, in a
                  quiet tone, replied</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, don't be in haste to destroy a friend. Curiosity has tempted me to go
                  too far; but, living, I can be worth a score of murdered light-keepers to you, in
                  this enterprise. Come, put aside those ugly-looking weapons, there, and let us
                  talk and act like men."</p>
               <p>"Fine words, these," retorted the captain, "but what assurance will you give that
                  you wont betray us?"</p>
               <p>"You are two—and both are <choice>
                     <sic>thorougly</sic>
                     <corr>thoroughly</corr>
                  </choice> armed. I am not a fool, captain. Dictate your terms. I am alone, and
                  defenceless, as you see."</p>
               <p>The manner and speech of the light-keeper surprised them, and they lowered their
                  pistols.</p>
               <p>"That is better," continued Noell. "Now, gentlemen, I have discovered your secret.
                  I appeal to you in all fairness, then, whether or not I am entitled to share with
                  you in this matter? This treasure was never earned by you, it never came here by
                  any honest means, it was not placed here by honest men. You, by some strange
                  fortune, have been put upon the scent of it, you have found it almost beneath my
                  household roof, and it is ample in amount to make us all princes in point of
                  worldly wealth. I will advise with you, plan with you, labor with you to complete
                  your enterprise, and I claim a share of this plunder. What say you?"</p>
               <p>"That's not so bad as I expected," said the lieutenant, addressing the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," continued Noell, "I mean you fairly. Try me! I am now poorer than you
                  are, and my will is to serve you. You can make me rich without stinting
                  yourselves. Shall we divide?"</p>
               <p>"No!" exclaimed the captain. "The treasure is ours—it is mine. I will consent to
                  nothing but your silence—alive or dead!"</p>
               <p>"Be it so, gentlemen," added Noell, calmly. "You can act your pleasure—for you
                  have the power in your own hands. Allow me to retire. Your plans, of course, are
                  all completed to remove this gold, to-night. You see I cannot prevent it?"</p>
               <p>"Leave us then, to our work," replied the captain. "I have no wish to dabble in
                  human blood, but the possession of this treasure is life or death to us. If you do
                  not molest us, we shall pay you roundly for our entertainment here. If you offer
                  the slightest impediment to our proceedings, I will send a bullet into your heart
                  on the first intimation of your treachery. Go!"</p>
               <p>Glad to escape the peril he found himself in, on any terms, Noell did not loiter
                  for a second hint on the subject, but instantly left the scoundrels to themselves;
                  feeling in no wise certain that one or both of them might not conclude to send a
                  pistol-ball after him as he passed through the door!</p>
               <p>When he entered his own room, supper was already upon the table. A thought seemed
                  suddenly to flash upon him, and he said to Nelly:</p>
               <p>"Bring me the octagon flask from the medicine chest. Here is the key—quick!"</p>
               <p>The flask was instantly brought. A bottle of wine stood upon the table, the custom
                  of the strangers being to finish their meal with a glass or two of Rhenish or
                  Hock. As if nothing had occurred to mar the customary family routine, Nelly called
                  to the visitors that supper awaited them. Desirous to aid in disguising the
                  threatening scene that had so recently occurred, the two men responded directly to
                  the call of the daughter, and securing the door of their apartment, as usual, went
                  in to the tea-table as though nothing at all had happened to disturb them.</p>
               <p>They ate sparingly, and sipped a goblet of wine. The meal had been discussed
                  rather silently, however; and Nelly was just upon the point of rallying her
                  visitors on their unwonted reserve, when the captain's eyes suddenly became fixed
                  in their sockets, and he sat stark and stiff in his chair, as if struck with
                  asphyxia, or paralysis! The lieutenant emptied his glass, gazed on his companion
                  an instant, made a spasmodic effort to speak or rise, but immediately his face
                  paled, his muscles became rigid, and he, too, was as helpless as a statue!</p>
               <p>"Quick, Nell," said her now excited father, "bring a rope! Lose no time in asking
                  questions. Do as I bid you—don't get alarmed—I will explain all to you at the
                  proper time."</p>
               <p>So accustomed was Nelly to obey implicitly her parent's directions, relying on his
                  judgment, as authority, that he had but to give his order to have it executed, if
                  within her power. In a moment Nelly returned with a coil of rope-yarn.</p>
               <p>"More, more, Nelly; to secure these rascals firmly," said Noell.</p>
               <p>"Are they <emph>dead,</emph> father?" exclaimed Nelly, a good deal
                  concerned—though still relying on her parent's discretion.</p>
               <p>"Have no fears on that score, Nelly," he said. "Here, bind his arms, while I
                  secure the other. They are robbers and scoundrels; they would rob me under my very
                  roof, Nelly, as I will show you, and I choose to have them at arm's length, since
                  there are two of them."</p>
               <p>"How did this happen?" asked Nelly, in a whisper. "What caused this sudden
                  stupefaction? Is it serious—are they <emph>poisoned,</emph> father?"</p>
               <p>"No, my girl, no."</p>
               <p>"What then? They are immovable and stiff! Will they recover, father?" continued
                  the girl, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Presently, Nell, presently. I repeat it, be firm. I shall need your aid, now. No
                  permanent harm will come to the villains, I promise you. The contents of that
                  flask has done the work. The liquid is an inodorous and powerful narcotic, and it
                  was effectually applied. They must be removed from this room, at once," continued
                  Noell, uneasily. And opening the side door that communicated with the inner
                  apartment, he raised first one and then the other of the still helpless forms of
                  the strangers, and placed them out of sight within his sleeping-room. Then
                  cautiously examining the cords that bound them, hands and feet, and securing the
                  chairs to the wainscoting, he drew down the curtains, opened the windows for
                  ventilation, and left the two rascals to temporary repose.</p>
               <p>Having now accomplished just what he could most have desired, though his means of
                  crippling the two strangers had been entirely a chance operation, he set himself
                  down to consider what his next course should be, under these circumstances.</p>
               <p>To say that like the most of the human race, Noell was not proof against the
                  temptations connected with a mine of gold, would be only stating<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000015"/> ting truth. He had never seen much money, in his
                  day and calling, but had had ample opportunity in a life of five-and-forty years
                  to ascertain the value of ready means. He now saw, within his grasp, an enormous
                  fortune. What should he do?"</p>
               <p>Twenty-four hours later, and it would have vanished—but for his accidental
                  discovery of it. What <emph>ought</emph> he to do? Did the treasure so found,
                  beneath <emph>his</emph> hearthstone, under <emph>his</emph> roof, rightfully
                  belong to these two men, who had come upon him thus stealthily and disembowelled
                  it beneath his very dwelling? He answered <emph>no!</emph> without a scruple of
                  conscience. Did the money belong to <emph>him?</emph> or had he the right to
                  dispose of it, as matters then stood, at least without legal authority? Had he any
                  right whatever to seize upon this property, notwithstanding it was found on his
                  grounds, and was still secreted within his threshold? These questions presented
                  themselves to Noell in all their different forms of suggestion, as he resolved the
                  matter over in his mind, and he would have "slept on it" but there was no time,
                  now, for sleep!</p>
               <p>Fortune—competency for the future—princely means for life—a splendid dowry for his
                  darling Nelly, all were now within his grasp, if he but decided to seize on this
                  strangely discovered treasure. Wiser and stronger-minded men than poor Harry Noell
                  have fallen before temptations not half so strong as that which now presented
                  itself to the light-keeper.</p>
               <p>An hour had passed away since the two men finished their drugged wine, and their
                  chances for a one third part, each, of the future they had so stealthily turned up
                  from the bowels of the earth, had been lessening every moment since they concluded
                  their very unlucky meal.</p>
               <p>Noell turned the whole affair carefully over in his mind, and with a not unnatural
                  leaning to self-interest in his agreements, at length resolved upon his future
                  course.</p>
               <p>"If," he continued, mentally, "if I were to lodge information against these
                  thieves, or villains, or whatever they are, if I were to state to the government
                  that this hoard of gold had been found by these men, who are here plainly with
                  forged letters and documents to deceive <emph>me,</emph> what should I gain? The
                  British government, the already battened officials who have grown obese upon the
                  toil and hardships and sweat of the poor, would answer 'it is too much for so
                  humble a citizen to look after, we will take care of it; it shall go to the
                  crown.' If I suffer these men now to be liberated, they will surely murder me and
                  my child, and none will ever be the wiser in regard to our fate, or their
                  whereabouts, when they shall have escaped with this mine of wealth. It shall be
                  mine, it <emph>is</emph> mine!"</p>
               <p>Harry Noell had resolved all doubts, and settled all compunctions to his own
                  present satisfaction; and he felt that he was now answerable only to himself for
                  the future consequences of the bold and determined step he had concluded upon.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">A NIGHT OF EXCITEMENT.</head>
               <p>NOELL had not the remotest idea what means had really been settled upon by his
                  visitors to remove the treasure, though he suspected, from their absence during
                  the previous afternoon, that arrangements had been made at the village for a team
                  or teams to come over to the light during that night, for the purpose of clearing
                  the shed of its rich burthen, at once, before morning. In this supposition, based
                  upon the appearance of things in the building where the gold still lay, he was
                  partly right and partly wrong. Midnight had been fixed upon for the removal of the
                  wealth thus gathered, but arrangements had been effected with two fishermen to
                  receive the "luggage and effects" of the two self-styled government officials, who
                  fixed upon this rather suspicious hour because, as they said, the tide then served
                  them most conveniently.</p>
               <p>Long before the hour agreed on, however, Noell had got out all the jars and the
                  small chests, the contents of which he had quickly conveyed on board and stowed
                  away in the ballast room of his own yacht, which rode at her anchor near the inner
                  cliff. The contents of the heavy and larger chests were such that the clearing of
                  them was a work of time, in comparison. By dint of sharp labor and application,
                  however, cheered by the reflection that, if fortunate in his designs, this was the
                  last work he should have to perform at present, the light-keeper removed every
                  coin of gold and every bar of silver that was in sight, in the shed; the hatches
                  were secured, and Noell returned to look after the condition of his prisoners.</p>
               <p>Nelly had retired early, to catch a few hours' rest, by advice of her father, who
                  informed her that he should need her attendance during the night. She slept very
                  little, however, for the recollections of the scene at the supper-table haunted
                  her, and she felt anxious about the result.</p>
               <p>As the light-keeper hurried ashore in his dory, from his last trip to the yacht,
                  he thought he heard the sound of oars, near the shore. He halted upon the beach,
                  and instantly discovered three men who had just arrived in a large boat, from the
                  nearest town as it proved. They inquired for Captain Stark, and informed Noell
                  that they came down by order of that worthy and his lieutenant, to remove their
                  luggage and traps to the village; where horses were in waiting to take them to
                  London.</p>
               <p>As this plan was entirely unexpected by Noell, he was for a moment at a loss what
                  to do, or what reply to make. But he soon recovered himself, and said in an easy
                  tone:</p>
               <p>"The luggage is here, and I will help you to<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000016"/> get it down. The captain will be up to-morrow
                  morning, with his friend."</p>
               <p>"He thought he would come with us to-night, but I told him it would be a long
                  pull, and he would get tired."</p>
               <p>"Yes. He will not go, now. You may look for him in the course of to-morrow. The
                  chests, etc., you will keep in your charge until he arrives."</p>
               <p>"O, yes, we understand that. He said there were some large chests, and a variety
                  of things, some trunks of heavy books and implements, and the like. We'll see to
                  them all, carefully," continued the skipper of the boat. In a short time a portion
                  of the heavy (but empty) chests were aboard, with sundry articles, nearest at
                  hand, which Noel selected with a view to appear to carry out the captain's
                  intentions with the boatmen.</p>
               <p>Noell followed the men down to the beach for the last time, at length; and handing
                  the skipper a large roll, he said:</p>
               <p>"This is all. How long will it take to row up?"</p>
               <p>"Till near daylight."</p>
               <p>"Well, a good-voyage to you."</p>
               <p>The boatman said "good morning," and the sound of the dipping oars was soon lost
                  in the distance, as the watermen disappeared with their precious freight.</p>
               <p>The light-keeper cautiously opened the door of the room where his prisoners were
                  confined, but both were breathing heavily—not having wakened from the moment they
                  so suddenly fell asleep.</p>
               <p>"Capital!" exclaimed Noell. "Where ignorance is bliss, good gentlemen, 'twere
                  folly to be wise. You seem to be enjoying yourselves vastly, though upon my word
                  you sleep heavily. However, you will wake up by-and-by, and I am sure you will
                  feel greatly relieved, after this sound rest, for which you ought to feel very
                  grateful to me, though I have no doubt, you will abuse me, hereafter for it! Sleep
                  on. Your luggage has gone forward, agreeably to your directions; you will have no
                  further trouble on that score."</p>
               <p>Then placing a pitcher of water before each of them, and a dish of bread and meat
                  upon a little table between them, he carefully released the hands of the
                  lieutenant, in order that he might escape starvation, when he should recover, and
                  also be able to assist the captain, and fastening the door strongly upon the
                  outside, he bade them "good-night," and left them firmly locked in the arms of
                  Somnus.</p>
               <p>Not a moment was now lost. Hastily making up his wardrobe, and bidding Nelly do
                  the same, they seized such trifles as they most valued, got quickly on board the
                  yacht, and left the scene of their perils, their labors, and their troubles,
                  forever!</p>
               <p>It was far into the middle of the following day, when a prickling sensation,
                  first, and then a nervous shock or start was felt by the captain, who lazily
                  opened his eyes, but seemed either too tired or too weak to determine where he
                  was. After a few minutes, however, he rallied and attempted to get up; but found
                  that his arms and hands and legs were tied fast together, while his whole body was
                  secured firmly to the chair in which he was bound, immovably.</p>
               <p>He cried out faintly at first, and then more audibly to the lieutenant, who took
                  not the slightest notice of his appeals, however.</p>
               <p>"Dead?" muttered the captain.</p>
               <p>"Say, leftenant! Are you dead?" but the echo of his own voice was all the response
                  he obtained.</p>
               <p>Various were the captain's devices to get near enough to his companion to touch
                  him in some way, but all was useless—he was bound hand and foot, and the thing was
                  impossible. Desperate, at last, he yelled for assistance.</p>
               <p>"Help! Help, here! Hillo—hillo! Murder—help, help!"</p>
               <p>But no one came. The sun shone on, noon passed, and a raging thirst attacked the
                  captain. The water stood before him, but he could not reach it. "Lef'tenant!" he
                  screamed, in his agony—and his companion suddenly started and said, "down with
                  him! down—" and then, putting his released hands to his forehead, he cried "Gad!
                  What <emph>is</emph> all this!"</p>
               <p>Very soon he recovered himself, woke up, and looked to behold the captain tied to
                  a huge old chair, and to find himself in a similar dilemma. As quickly as he could
                  he got a knife from his pocket and commenced to sever the cords that confined him.
                  Then gulping down a draught of water, he staggered towards the captain and cut
                  away the ropes that detained him in bondage. As soon as their thirst had been
                  quenched, a storm of anathemas was poured upon the head of the light-keeper, who
                  they swore was the cause of all this.</p>
               <p>They dashed to the door, wild with excitement and madness, only to find themselves
                  fast locked ed in! Their pistols had been taken from them, and there was no
                  implement in the room with which they could force an opening. At length, the
                  captain seized a chair. After a long trial the fastenings gave way, and the
                  prisoners emerged once more into the main room, and from thence into the open air
                  and liberty.</p>
               <p>They found the light-house deserted. On descending to the scene of their late
                  toil, they discovered that most of the chests were gone, and those that remained
                  behind were broken and empty. The yacht was nowhere to be seen, and the lamps in
                  the cone of the light-house were still burning. It was evident that Mr. Noell and
                  his daughter had taken summary leave! The whole of the treasure had disappeared,
                  the two men were exceedingly weak and ill from the effects of the drugging and
                  their confinement, and their feelings may well be fancied as they turned
                  mournfully towards the dwelling, at least, filled with mortification and
                  disappointment!</p>
               <p>"This is a precious termination to our job," said the captain, moodily.</p>
               <p>"What do you now propose to do?" asked the other.</p>
               <p>"What can we do, to be sure?" replied the captain, half in reply and half in query
                  to himself. "What <emph>can</emph> be done? But for the two-jars of doubloons
                  which we carried away with us, we should now be penniless. And the infernal rascal
                  has had it all in his own way! Why should we not have been more cautious about
                  that single goblet of wine?"</p>
               <p>"I never knew a case of drugging—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Poisoning,</emph> man!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I never knew a similar case," said the lieutenant, "where the effect was so
                  instantaneous, except where death was produced."</p>
               <p>"Ay! But we might both have been killed, you see, as it was, for aught he
                  cared."</p>
               <p>"No, I don't think he meant death," said the lieutenant.</p>
               <p>"Well, lef'— I tell you what I mean," continued the captain, as he set his teeth
                  firmly, and backed it by an oath, "I mean death to Harrison Noell, if ever I meet
                  him again in this world!"</p>
               <p>"And well he deserves it," replied his friend. "But come, we must leave this
                  place. We have been here now, full long. Let us secure what we have saved, and
                  leave the wreck to its fate."</p>
               <p>"We will depart at once," continued the captain; "but not until we have destroyed
                  this infernal trap, that has been at once our fortune and our ruin. What's this?"
                  he added, picking up a letter, addressed to a man at the village, and which upon
                  opening he found contained a request from Noell that the person would come down,
                  and take charge of the light-house, lest accidents should occur from the absence
                  of the lights.</p>
               <p>"And who did he suppose would be his letter-bearer?" said the captain, savagely.
                  "Not a vestige, not a shilling's worth of this pile shall be left standing, that
                  fire will destroy." And true to his word he tore the letter to pieces, and without
                  further delay commenced to carry his threat into execution.</p>
               <p>The two adventurers heaped up the old furniture and combustibles into the centre
                  of the rooms, after ransacking the premises to ascertain if anything of value
                  could be taken away, and gathering together all the ropes and dry sails that could
                  be found, they added these to the pile, and prepared to depart. It was near
                  nightfall when they took to their small boat and put away from the beach, after
                  effectually firing the premises in all directions.</p>
               <p>A little after dark, the inhabitants of the village were alarmed by the cry of
                  "fire!" A dense smoke at first and then a spire of living flame shot high up from
                  the lower extremity of the beach, which told the residents too plainly that the
                  light-house was in flames. Aid was immediately despatched, but full two hours
                  elapsed before the neighbors could reach the scene. When they did arrive, all was
                  as still as death itself! The light-house was a smouldering mass of ruins, but no
                  voices broke the silence save those of the newly arrived friends. Noell and his
                  daughter could not be found, his well known dory floated at the end of the reef,
                  and it was clear to the minds of all present that they had been smothered and
                  buried in the ruins!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">SPECULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS.</head>
               <p>As soon as the requisite inquiries could be made, on the day or two succeeding the
                  destruction of the light-house, it was discovered that the yacht lately presented
                  to Noell was missing, and it further came out that the two co called government
                  officers were also gone—no one knew whither. They were known to have been in the
                  village the day but one before the burning, and it was also shown that Noell had
                  aided in getting away some of their luggage, which they were to follow to the
                  village the next day. Upon opening the trunks, nothing was found in them! And upon
                  communicating with the proper department, it turned out that no such commission
                  had ever been authorized, and that they were arrant impostors.</p>
               <p>Nothing further had since been seen or heard of these two men. It was therefore
                  concluded, that, for purposes of their own, they had probably murdered Noell and
                  his daughter, pillaged the premises, set fire to the light-house to cover up their
                  tracks, and then seizing upon the yacht, which was known as a fast sailer and a
                  valuable vessel, had escaped to parts unknown. This very plausible theory, under
                  all the circumstances, was generally adopted, and steps were taken by the public
                  authorities to search for the fugitives—but neither the men nor the Waif could
                  anywhere be found.</p>
               <p>One morning, a week after the catastrophe, young Manfred was startled, at "Burton
                  House," upon meeting with the following in one of the journals of the day.</p>
               <p>"A frightful piece of intelligence reached town, last evening, by the southern
                  mails, giving the details of a most unfortunate scene at the light-house, Beachy
                  Head. The buildings have been destroyed completely by fire, and the well-known
                  keeper of the light—Harry Noell, and his daring and beautiful daughter,
                  perished!</p>
               <p>"It farther appears that two scoundrels, whose real names have not yet transpired,
                  but who palmed themselves off by means of forged credentials, upon the good graces
                  and hospitalities of Noell, as 'officers in his majesty's naval service,' have
                  latterly been quartered at the light, for ostensible purposes, but really for
                  objects of plunder, probably. These men were known to have been with Noell up to
                  the day before the fire, and since then have not been seen.</p>
               <p>"A fine yacht, the property of Noell, is also gone, and it is very apparent that
                  these knaves have escaped in her. It is believed that they quarrelled with the
                  light-keeper, probably murdered him and his child, set fire to the dwelling and
                  buildings, for the purpose of hiding their atrocious guilt—and fled, carrying off
                  in the yacht the plunder they may have obtained.</p>
               <p>"We trust that the guilty wretches may quickly be found, and delivered over to the
                  king's ministers of justice. A temporary floating light has been stationed off
                  Beachy Head, until another building can be erected, and meantime as will be seen,
                  the authorities have properly offered a reward of five hundred pounds sterling for
                  the arrest and delivery of the authors of this diabolical crime."</p>
               <p>This fearful piece of news shocked young Manfred greatly, and he addressed a
                  letter to Wilford in Paris immediately, enclosing him all the details he could
                  obtain. The young <choice>
                     <sic>millioniare</sic>
                     <corr>millionaire</corr>
                  </choice> was really deeply moved for the untimely fate of the light-keeper, and
                  especially of his interesting child, whom he had chanced to become acquainted with
                  under such favorable circumstances, to them.</p>
               <p>When Wilford received the letters and journals containing the particulars of the
                  outrage, he was completely unnerved. He had never ceased to remember Noell and his
                  daughter with the liveliest gratitude and the highest considerations of
                  friendship, for he had had ample proof that they possessed more than the ordinary
                  allowance of the "milk of human kindness" in their compositions. He had already
                  planned a surprise for them, having but recently laid in a beautiful picture of
                  Nelly, from recollection, which he was about to complete and forward to Beachy
                  Head, without notice, in order that they might see how well he had borne in mind
                  the features of her who had been so kind and so useful to him at a time when he
                  needed succor and friendly attention. The likeness in this picture was very
                  truthful, and a sweeter contour was never put on canvass. Even Wilford himself was
                  astonished and delighted with his success; and until he examined carefully the
                  admirable "counterfeit presentment" he had produced, he had never fully realized
                  how beautiful a face Nelly Noell had possessed!</p>
               <p>And now that she had been so ruthlessly destroyed, he turned his whole attention,
                  for the time being, to the immediate completion of the picture, so exquisitely and
                  fortunately commenced. Her lineaments were indelibly fixed in his memory, and he
                  rendered the portrait a perfect representation of her features, while as a work of
                  art it was the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef-d'œuvre</foreign> of his life. So
                  earnestly did he apply himself to this work that at the expiration of a month he
                  had perfected a picture that rivalled the productions of the foremost artists in
                  Paris. The beautiful ideal he had thus finished, was lauded by his compeers and
                  admired by connoisseurs, and his fame quickly spread through novelty-loving
                  Paris.</p>
               <p>The rooms of Wilford were soon thronged with amateurs and patrons whose orders
                  crowded upon him so rapidly as to occupy his time incessantly, and at splendidly
                  remunerating prices. Before he had passed a year in Paris, he had become the
                  leading artist, and his name had been more than once favorable mentioned at the
                  Tuileries.</p>
               <p>Wilford had never yet fathomed the intent of the curious communication he had
                  found in his portfolio, and he had never yet ascertained who was the author of it.
                  True, he knew that it was "Marie," because the second note that found its way into
                  his hands, in the same hand-writing, was duly signed by the beggar-girl of the
                  Pont des Fleurs. How it should chance that a note should have been enclosed in his
                  sketch-book before he left England, and how another, similar in character and
                  referring to the first, should reach him in France subsequently, and come from the
                  same source, was not a little perplexing.</p>
               <p>But who <emph>was</emph> Marie? In vain had he endeavored, for eight long months,
                  to unravel this mystery. Thrice within a few weeks he had now been favored with
                  fresh evidences, in the shape of these agreeable missives, that this same "Marie"
                  was not far distant from him; and the last note, which he had just clandestinely
                  received, breathed a spirit of romance and beauty that more than ever impelled the
                  young artist to seek out the retreat of its accomplished and singular author.</p>
               <p>"You were born, Wilford," ran this letter, "under the bright star of good fortune.
                  Have you experienced the trials, the mishaps, the disappointments that lurk about
                  the path of the indigent artist? Have you seen peril, and felt the oppression that
                  attends the side of poverty? <emph>I know you have</emph>. But these trials and
                  jeopardies and crossings have proved the spurs that have urged you forward to
                  competency, to fame and to an honorable station in your profession. Maintain the
                  pinnacle you have reached! Stand firmly upon the topmost round of the ladder which
                  you have ascended so rapidly. There are eyes bent on you lovingly and anxiously;
                  there are hearts that beat quicker at the proud mention of your name, as it is
                  heard in marble halls, on the lips of jewelled crowds of admirers; there is one
                  who prays for you, secretly, and whose<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5956-00000018"/>
                  life will be devoted to your weal, though you may never know how ardently she
                  regards you!</p>
               <p>"The lowly-born and humble may not aspire to sit at the side of affluence and
                  noble blood. This is unnatural. But talent, Wilford—the light of brain and soul
                  which the good God dispenses among all grades of his subjects, the wealth of
                  intellect, all priceless in its value, comes to the poor or the lordly, alike,
                  without the asking. This precious gift affiliates with its kind, and mind will act
                  upon mind, soul sympathize with soul, heart beat for heart, in curious unison,
                  though a wide gulf of forbidding space may exist between its possessors—in point
                  of station or pecuniary fortune.</p>
               <p>"Let <emph>me</emph> watch over <emph>you</emph> then, Wilford! Suffer me to be
                  distant but still near to you, whenever you may need the soothing influences of
                  friendship and affection. I have seen the sweat-drop of pain and anguish settle on
                  your fair forehead. I have heard your deep moan of distress when you did not dream
                  that the hand which traces these lines was busy in cooling your throbbing and
                  fevered temples. We have met, Wilford—no matter where—and I have dared to hope
                  that we shall meet again, under more genial and favorable auspices—when you will
                  have had time to know me better, and to believe that I am your faithful friend,
                  though now only the poor and humble MARIE."</p>
               <p>"I would give a hundred crowns," said Wilford, excitedly, "if I could meet the
                  author of this pretty epistle, face to face."</p>
               <p>A gentle rapping at the door of his studio, at this moment, started him to his
                  feet.</p>

               <head type="sub">A COMMISSION.</head>
               <p>THE figure of a female gracefully entered the apartment a moment afterwards,
                  followed by a servant in costly and aristocratic livery. The lady was richly but
                  simply attired, and she addressed the artist in provincial French.</p>
               <p>Wilford spoke the language but indifferently, yet he had been long enough in Paris
                  to have acquired a respectable smattering of the tongue. She said:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur, have I the pleasure of speaking with Wilford, the artist?"</p>
               <p>The painter bowed, and pointed his visitor to a lounge.</p>
               <p>The lady was well formed, but she was so deeply veiled, that Wilford could not
                  determine her age. Her voice was pleasant, but full-toned and authoritative, and
                  the artist politely inquired if he could be of service to her.</p>
               <p>"I have called, monsieur," she replied, "to look at your pictures. My friend, the
                  Countess de Charmand has spoken enthusiastically of your genius, and I have seen a
                  single effort of yours in her possession, which pleases me."</p>
               <p>You allude to the <title>Magdalen</title>, madame?"</p>
               <p>"You are correct."</p>
               <p>"The countess does me great honor. It was one of my early efforts, on arriving in
                  Paris, madame, since when I have aimed to improve myself, somewhat."</p>
               <p>He then invited the lady into his exhibition room, where a dozen elaborately
                  finished pictures—copies or originals, were suspended upon the walls. After
                  examining these, the eye of the visitor rested upon one design that was partially
                  concealed by a curtain suspended over it, and which seemed especially to interest
                  her.</p>
               <p>"What is this, monsieur?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"You may have heard of it, madame," he answered. "It is an original—the
                  'Light-Keeper's Daughter,'" and he raised the screen which covered it, exposing
                  his master-piece to the eager inspection of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"It is beautiful, indeed," she exclaimed. "Was she so very fair?" continued the
                  lady, examining the picture, closely.</p>
               <p>"It is no uncommon fault of artists, madame," said Wilford, "to flatter beauty.
                  But in this instance, I assure you, I have scarcely done the original full
                  justice."</p>
               <p>"Then she must have been very comely."</p>
               <p>"You are right, madame—but still the canvass wrongs her. There was a soul that
                  looked out from her sweet blue eyes, an expression of guileless innocence and
                  purity, that no artist-touch could imitate. I deem the likeness good—I may say
                  accurate; but I feel how poor are all my efforts to give to the face the true
                  sentiment of the original."</p>
               <p>"Then this is not a fancy sketch?"</p>
               <p>"No, madame. The original lives only in my memory, however."</p>
               <p>"And you painted it from recollection, only?"</p>
               <p>"That is all, madame. You may have heard of a terrible occurrence that took place
                  some months since at one of the light-houses on the English coast, below Dover.
                  The premises were fired—by accident or intent—and the keeper, with his child,
                  perished in the ruins!"</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5956-00000019"/>
               <p>"I think I heard of it, or read of it, at the time," replied the lady.</p>
               <p>"This was his daughter, madame—Nelly! A softer heart than hers, a purer mind, a
                  kinder disposition never was vouchsafed to mortal, I believe. Her fate was,
                  indeed, a cruel one. I had painted this likeness, which I proposed to have sent
                  out to them as a token of my remembrance of their kindness to me, when I was once
                  thrown upon their hospitality, in distress, but before it was completed, Nelly,
                  with her noble father, had gone to rest with the angels!"</p>
               <p>There was a moment of sympathetic silence, that was broken by the lady, who
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur, what is the value of this picture?"</p>
               <p>"Priceless, madame," answered Wilford, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"You will sell it, I presume?"</p>
               <p>"Never, madame!"</p>
               <p>"I am pecuniarily able to reward you amply, monsieur, and I wish to possess your
                  best picture. A hundred crowns—"</p>
               <p>"The crown of France itself, madame, would not tempt me to part with that
                  picture."</p>
               <p>"Are you serious, monsieur?"</p>
               <p>"Upon my honor, madame, I am. If a copy of it would please you, I might be
                  induced—"</p>
               <p>"No, monsieur. I have only originals in my galleries, and a copy of
                     <emph>that</emph> effort would be valueless to me."</p>
               <p>"I could improve on this, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"Still, I should not possess the original."</p>
               <p>"Your pardon, madame. I appreciate your ideas—and will with great pleasure,
                  furnish you an original upon any other subject within the range of my <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">role</foreign>, but I cannot part with this."</p>
               <p>"Five hundred crowns, monsieur, for this picture."</p>
               <p>"Your pardon again, madame—but I assure you I must decline your generous
                  offer."</p>
               <p>"You are a man of the world, and you pursue your profession for gain. I will give
                  you a thousand crows for your 'Light-Keeper's Daughter,'" said the lady,
                  magnanimously.</p>
               <p>"A thousand crowns is a munificent sum, lady, and it would far outstrip the
                  intrinsic value of such a work. But <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pardonnez
                     moi</foreign>, madame, I cannot sell it."</p>
               <p>"If you thus value your own ideal creation, pray what value did you put upon the
                  fair being whom you have so delicately portrayed? Surely, she must have been very
                  dear to you."</p>
               <p>"I never realized her worth; but it is too late, now, alas, to recover—" and then
                  as if to change the subject, he added, "will it not please madame to order
                  something of a different character?"</p>
               <p>"Monsieur, since you are so determined, I will confess to you that I have your
                  sentiments of devotion, and I will no longer attempt to effect a change in your
                  mind. I desire to place one of your efforts in my collection, however, and I give
                  you <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> in the premises. I will only
                  stipulate that it be a female figure, and original in itself. When shall I have
                  the pleasure of examining it?"</p>
               <p>"My engagements at present are such, that I can promise nothing sooner than three
                  months hence."</p>
               <p>"You will complete it by that time?"</p>
               <p>"I think there is no doubt about it, madame."</p>
               <p>"Adieu! then, monsieur, I will call upon you three months from to-day, and shall
                  rely upon your best efforts."</p>
               <p>The servant opened the door, madame passed gracefully out, and Wilford bethought
                  him, a moment afterwards, that he had omitted to inquire the lady's address. It
                  was too late. He drew aside his window-curtain, and a magnificent carriage was
                  just rolling away from his door.</p>
               <p>"Fortune favors me," said Wilford, slowly, "I was in fault not to have asked my
                  lady's address. But she will come again," and he turned once more to his
                  easel.</p>
               <p>When he passed into his exhibition room, a few minutes after the lady left, he
                  found an envelope upon the floor near the window, which upon examining, he found
                  addressed to himself, in a familiar hand.</p>
               <p>"This is from <emph>Marie</emph>," he said, "how came it here?"</p>
               <p>There was no one present to answer his question, and no one had been in that
                  apartment save himself and his recent visitor, for eight-and-forty hours. Here was
                  a fresh mystery. But he opened the note, and devoured its contents without further
                  delay.</p>
               <p>"Wilford, you will be called upon soon by a lady of great wealth and a sincere
                  lover of art, who desires to obtain one of your pictures. She is particular in her
                  ideas, and fancies only the choicest of works for her already well-furnished
                  galleries. Humor any whim that she may exhibit, permit her to choose, without
                  limit, from your collection, and you may be sure to profit, largely, from her
                  favor and patronage. Her means are ample and her liberality a proverb. May you
                  ever prosper and be happy! MARIE."</p>
               <p>"I will give a hundred <foreign xml:lang="FRA">louis d'ors</foreign>," said
                  Wilford, "to kiss the hand of my guardian Marie!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE MARQUIS DE BRANDT.</head>
               <p>UPON the northerly bank of the river Gironde, in France, near the easterly portion
                  of the Departments of Lot and Garonne, is situated the beautiful town of <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">la Realle</foreign>. There came to this place to reside, some
                  months prior to the period we were discussing in the last chapter, a French
                  nobleman, the Marquis of Brandt, and his family. They were reputed to be immensely
                  rich, and the lavish expenditure they indulged in gave evidence that their wealth
                  must be princely.</p>
               <p>The family of de Brandt consisted of his wife and three children (a son and two
                  daughters), and his household—servants, grooms, pages and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >attaches</foreign>—numbering some three scores of persons. His stud of horses
                  embraced several of the finest in Europe, his domain was one of the most extensive
                  in the whole south of France, and he lived as if for the purpose of enjoying life
                  in its best attire and to its fullest extent. His income was enormous, and he
                  dealt it out with a liberal hand, in all the ramifications of his intercourse with
                  those who surrounded or dealt with him or his.</p>
               <p>The marquis was a hale and powerful built man of fifty, with a somewhat rugged and
                  harsh exterior, but possessing rare good qualities of mind and heart. His general
                  appearance was the more rough from his habit of permitting his heavy dark beard to
                  grow unshorn, and his continual exposure of himself to out-of-door exercise in the
                  field or upon the water. He was a perfect Nimrod in the hunt, and a Neptune on the
                  waves. No weather was too boisterous for him, no season too inclement; his
                  constitution seemed of iron, his will was impetuous, and his enjoyment consisted
                  almost entirely in being abroad in the open air, from January to December.</p>
               <p>His wife, somewhat his junior in years, was the personification of dignity, grace
                  and good-breeding. Benevolent to a fault, she lived apparently to do good to her
                  neighbors; and a long list of pensioners upon her generous bounty had cause to
                  bless her charity and kindness. The son was a sickly youth, now eight or nine
                  years old, whose chance for a prolonged existence was very dubious, and who was
                  almost constantly housed—in the care of a nurse—lest any adverse wind should
                  unfortunately blow upon him and hasten his long anticipated death. The
                  daughters—Helen and Hortense—were blooming beauties, just budding into womanhood,
                  the former about eighteen and the other sixteen years of age. A happy and lovely
                  family was that of the Marquis de Brandt, surrounded by all the profusion of
                  comforts which the parent's wealth commanded, and scattering the income<pb
                     n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5956-00000020"/> come of their almost royal fortune
                  everywhere around them, with an unsparing and commendable discretion.</p>
               <p>At the opening of the fashionable season in Paris, the marquis proposed to visit
                  the capital, with his lady and two daughters. A large detachment of servants were
                  selected from the household, and a suitable establishment was left behind in
                  charge of their country estate, in the meantime. Superb carriages, elegant horses
                  and caparisons, liveried lacqueys, grooms, pages, secretaries and footmen made up
                  the retinue of the marquis, whose <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entree</foreign> into
                  the great city was the occasion of a marked sensation among the world of fashion
                  and quality assembled there for enjoyment and mutual display.</p>
               <p>The style of living set up at Paris by de Brandt rivalled that of royalty. There
                  seemed to be no lack of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">l'argent</foreign> a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">l'or</foreign> in his outlays. His society and that of his
                  agreeable family was courted by the wealthy and honorable from all nations
                  sojourning there, and a continual round of gaiety, balls, fetes, and routs, kept
                  them continually on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign>, from week's
                  end to week's end.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the season, as Wilford was busily engaged one day in his studio
                  upon the now half-completed "Madonna," which he had designed anew for the strange
                  lady who had left it to his own taste to select his subject, his door opened
                  without warning and an old familiar voice accosted him with:</p>
               <p>"Wil.' miboy! How are you this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Manfred!" exclaimed the artist, springing up and warmly grasping the extended
                  palm of his early friend, "Manfred, I am delighted to see you."</p>
               <p>"I am rejoiced to find you, Wilford. And the more so, that I hear the most glowing
                  accounts of your success. How are you getting on?"</p>
               <p>"Never so well, my good friend, thanks to your favor and the encouragement you
                  have extended to my poor efforts."</p>
               <p>"And what is this?" asked Manfred, examining the exquisite design upon which the
                  painter was engaged.</p>
               <p>"One of my own, Manfred, intended for an unknown patron, who has flattered me by
                  ordering whatever I chose to execute for her, without limit as to price. I intend
                  to give her a 'Madonna' after my own conception of the virgin. How do you like the
                  design?"</p>
               <p>"Admirable, miboy! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Superbe</foreign>, as we Frenchmen
                  should say," replied Manfred, enthusiastically. "I had no idea you had so
                  wonderfully improved, though I have seen and heard of your remarkable progress of
                  late."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, thank you," responded the artist. "But, do you know, when one gets
                  fairly upon the high road to success, how easy it becomes the province of
                  flatterers to urge one forward? In your case, Manfred, I do not mean this to
                  apply, because I know your goodness and your frankness of heart. But the
                  world—Manfred—the great <emph>small</emph> world of admirers of our art are
                  impulsive, and they move on thoughtlessly, as their associates or their superiors
                  may chance to dictate. I am doing well, professionally, and I find no fault with
                  my good fortune."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to know it," continued Manfred, still gazing at the "Madonna" upon the
                  easel. "But, Wilford—the <emph>likeness</emph>, here—who sat for it?"</p>
               <p>Wilford smiled, and said "do you really think so?"</p>
               <p>"Surely, miboy, neither you nor I can mistake <emph>that</emph> face."</p>
               <p>"Then I must alter the features, somewhat."</p>
               <p>"Never a jot, man! for your reputation!" warmly exclaimed his friend. "A purer,
                  softer gentler countenance—and one more appropriate, you could never elect. It is
                  past improvement, it is all that you could wish. Complete it as it is, by all
                  means. The very soul of Nelly Noell looks upward from the canvass here—subdued,
                  confiding, purified, resigned—incomparable!"</p>
               <p>"My thoughts <emph>were</emph> turned to Nelly," said Wilford, quietly, "when I
                  designed this picture; but I did not think the likeness so remarkable. Here,
                  Manfred," added the painter, pointing to his inner room, and raising the curtain
                  that covered his favorite work. "Tell me what you think of this?" Manfred started
                  back with surprise and ejaculated:</p>
               <p>"Perfection, Wilford! It is Nelly's second self! I see it, now—the difference is
                  sufficiently marked. But this <emph>is</emph> Nelly, surely. Ah, miboy, she was a
                  sweet girl, to be sure. Did you ever think so, particularly, when she was alive?"
                  asked Manfred.</p>
               <p>"Did I not have cause to <emph>know</emph> this, Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"True, you had indeed. But you never spoke of it, especially."</p>
               <p>"Was I not thoroughly grateful to the Noells?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. But then—you didn't, perhaps, fully appreciate the—that is, I mean to
                  say, I never knew that you—a—"</p>
               <p>"You mean that you did not see me fall in love with Nelly, propose to her, marry
                  or elope with her, and wake up from so foolish a dream of boys' play to a
                  realization of the simple fact that I was but a poor penniless artist, waiting on
                  my good friends for bread, and that I had seized upon a poorer but confiding girl,
                  hitherto contented and happy, whose ruin must follow upon my recklessness and
                  poverty. Is not that what you mean to convey?"</p>
               <p>"Well, miboy, I now give you credit for more good sense than I thought you really
                  possessed!" said Manfred, pleasantly. "You are correct. I <emph>did</emph> think
                  you would carry your gratitude farther than you did. Her fate was a worse one, at
                  last, though! But you have most truthfully preserved poor Nelly's features. You
                  have not sold <emph>this</emph> picture?"</p>
               <p>"No, no."</p>
               <p>"Then it is mine—'sh! miboy, it is <emph>mine</emph>. Mine, at any figure you may
                  choose to put upon it—but remember, mine."</p>
               <p>"I have already refused a thousand crowns for that picture, Manfred. The very lady
                  for whom I am executing the 'Madonna,' yonder, insisted on my parting with it. I
                  offered her a copy, but she would have only originals, she said, and I declined
                  her generous proposal."</p>
               <p>"A thousand crowns! Upon my word, you are getting famous."</p>
               <p>"I will not <emph>sell</emph> it, Manfred; but, when I part with it, at all, I
                  will send it to you, at Burton House."</p>
               <p>"Enough, it is really beautiful."</p>
               <p>"And how long have you been in town?"</p>
               <p>"I came in the last diligence from Rouen, an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"Are you alone? Come to my hotel."</p>
               <p>"No, we make a party of seven, from London and Dover, brought to Paris by cards
                  from the <name>Marquise de Brandt</name>, who gives her <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >grande fete</foreign> to-morrow and next day. Have you heard of it?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes; I received a cover, I presume through the attention of my noble patron,
                  the Countess de Charmand, who has given herself much trouble to introduce me. This
                  entertainment, in prospective, has been town talk for a month."</p>
               <p>"And you will go, then?"</p>
               <p>"I did not intend to, but since you will be there, I shall certainly avail myself
                  of the politeness of the marchioness. Who are your party?"</p>
               <p>"Two couples from London, Miss Simplon, my father and myself."</p>
               <p>"Miss Simplon!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; you have seen her, at Burton House, I think?"</p>
               <p>"I remember," said Wilford, carelessly. "She is very pretty."</p>
               <p>"Yes, a rollicking madcap, though."</p>
               <p>"A fortune-hunter," said Wilford, sarcastically.</p>
               <p>"A clever girl, in her way, nevertheless," insisted Manfred.</p>
               <p>"But not successful," added Wilford, again.</p>
               <p>"Not yet," concluded Manfred. "You are sharp, to-day!"</p>
               <p>The subject was dropped, and the friends shortly after left the studio, in company
                  for a stroll.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FETE OF THE MARCHIONESS DE BRANDT.</head>
               <p>ALL Paris was alive with enthusiasm as the splendid <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >fete</foreign> approached, and the magnificence of the preparations caused the
                  names of the illustrious marquis and marchioness of Brandt to be on everybody's
                  lips.</p>
               <p>At midnight, a long line of brilliant equipages had set down at the Hotel
                  Moncrieffe their lordly burthens, and the spacious <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >salons</foreign> of that spacious mansion were crowded with the city's
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign>. The honors of the occasion were
                  managed with exquisite good taste by the accomplished marquise, and her daughters
                  were pronounced inapproachable in beauty and deportment. The family were
                  comparative strangers in Paris, but their uncounted wealth had placed them at once
                  at the head of fashionable society there.</p>
               <p>The extensive gardens of the hotel were brilliantly illuminated, soft music
                  floated from the terraces and the balconies, the sparkling waters from a hundred
                  fountains glittered in the colored lights, the air was cool and inviting, and
                  scores of little groups were scattered along the paths and beneath the shadows of
                  permanent or artificial bowers of roses and evergreens—all filled with delight at
                  the charming enjoyments prepared for them.</p>
               <p>In the vast halls of the mansion, hundreds of both sexes were sauntering down the
                  polished floors, examining the pictures and statuary, or moving in the mazy waltz
                  or gallop to soul-enchanting melodies. The eye rested on a blaze of beauty,
                  adorned with costly attire and glistening jewels. The ear drank in sweet sounds of
                  bewitching music. The hearts of the multitude beat high with intoxicating
                  pleasure, and the gratified throng were enthusiastic in the expression of their
                  appreciation of the entertainment they were enjoying so deliciously.</p>
               <p>Almost alone, and for a time quite unnoticed, could be seen the figure of a youth
                  some three and-twenty years old, perhaps, as he sauntered about the saloons, now
                  nodding respectfully to a lady of rank, and now taken momentarily by the hand by
                  some sprig of nobility. It was young Wilford, the artist. He felt out of his
                  sphere, here, and he sought the friends he had expected to meet, from England. He
                  shortly encountered Manfred, who approached him cordially, with Miss Charlotte
                  Simplon resting languidly upon his arm.</p>
               <p>"Well, Wilford, I have been looking for you. Miss Simplon," he continued, pointing
                  to his charge, and presenting the lady, formally. "You remember her, I think?"</p>
               <p>Wilford bowed, and said he thought he had seen her at Burton House, some months
                  previously—but he met with so many faces and his position called him so much into
                  society that, really, he should scarcely have recognized her! This reply and the
                  manner of Wilford in delivering it, though perfectly courteous to the ear of
                  Manfred (who knew nothing of his friend's rejection by the beautiful coquette),
                  was not lost upon Miss Simplon. She felt the reproof keenly, but she could not
                  resent it.</p>
               <p>"Have you been presented to our charming host, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Not yet. I have been unable to meet with my friend the duchess, thus far," he
                  said, disposed to allow Miss Simplon to understand who were just now among his
                  friends!</p>
               <p>"Join us, then," added Manfred, "and allow me to introduce you. As to her
                  daughters, I have seen but one of them yet, but she is a magnificent creature, I
                  assure you."</p>
               <p>"I am greatly obliged to you, Manfred; but here comes my friend the Count
                  Delmatier. Do you know him? He will officiate."</p>
               <p>The count came up, Wilford presented him to Miss Simplon and her English
                  companion, and bowed himself away, civilly.</p>
               <p>"Who did you call the lady, Wilford?" asked the count.</p>
               <p>"Miss Simplon, or Simpleton—or some such name. An acquaintance of the Manfreds, of
                  Dover," said Wilford, indifferently.</p>
               <p>Their conversation was interrupted by the approach of the host and hostess, near
                  whom the count halted a moment, and then introduced his young friend Wilford, the
                  English artist.</p>
               <p>The marquis was a rather military looking man, than otherwise—tall, robust in form
                  and stiff in his movements. Sporting an immense shock of long black hair and heavy
                  untrimmed beard, he stalked about amid the crowd, a conspicuous object of notice,
                  especially as his estimable and lady-like consort, who hung upon his arm, was of a
                  delicate figure, comparatively, and most unlike her liege lord in any particular
                  whatever, save his politeness and urbanity of address.</p>
               <p>"Wilford," said the marquis, whose voice was harsh and peculiar in sound, "my
                  daughter;" and a splendid woman curtesied to the artist.</p>
               <p>"I have heard of you, monsieur, and am highly gratified to meet you here. The
                  Countess de Charmand and my noble friend the Duke of Heidelberg speak in glowing
                  terms of you."</p>
               <p>"I remember them gratefully," said Wilford.</p>
               <p>"I have promised myself and lady the pleasure of calling at your studio at an
                  early opportunity," continued the marquis. "Make yourself happy with us, here, and
                  become acquainted with my daughter." He passed the young lady over to his charge,
                  and taking the arm of Wilford, they moved down the saloon.</p>
               <p>The artist was fashionably dressed in a simple suit of black, and as he moved
                  about among the jewelled and giddy throng, with one of France's fairest daughters,
                  he was the object of envy to more than one "titled insignificance" who followed in
                  his wake. Wilford was happy, and never in better good nature with himself and all
                  the world about him, than he now was.</p>
               <p>"And you tell me," said the gay Miss Simplon, as she loitered along upon Manfred's
                  arm, "you say that Mr. Wilford is acquiring a fortune, rapidly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said his friend, "and he is deserving it, too."</p>
               <p>"He was but so-so as an artist, at home, surely."</p>
               <p>"He has improved astonishingly, I assure you. The latent talent he possessed has
                  been marvellously developed, in the past year or two, and he has recently produced
                  several pictures that rival the best efforts in the Louvre."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?"</p>
               <p>"It is even so. He numbers among his present patrons, some of the choicest
                  connoisseurs in the realm; and the nobility of France are showering fortune on
                  him, literally."</p>
               <p>"You surprise me," continued Miss Simplon, with considerable feeling.</p>
               <p>"There he is, with the younger daughter of the marquis," said Manfred. "Upon my
                  word, Wilford is looking in fine spirits, to-night."</p>
               <p>The speaker little knew how this attention to the rejected suitor rankled in the
                  coquette's heart</p>
               <p>Wilford joined the lady's parents, a moment afterwards, and as he did so, a
                  gentleman in glistening military uniform advanced, supporting the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">belle</foreign> of the evening, by musical acclamation, the
                  eldest daughter of the marquise—Helen de Brandt.</p>
               <p>Wilford saw her, and a sudden paleness shot across his handsome face, as if he had
                  been shocked with faintness.</p>
               <p>"Are you ill, monsieur?" inquired the marchioness, observing the painter's
                  confusion.</p>
               <p>"Your pardon," said Wilford, "no—no. I saw a lady, yonder—a face that so strongly
                  resembled another I once knew, and who is gone to a brighter world than this—that
                  I was struck with the singular and astonishing counterpart. I pray you excuse me,
                  madam—who <foreign xml:lang="FRA">is</foreign> she in the pink tulle, yonder?"</p>
               <p>"That is our eldest daughter, monsieur. I owe you an apology for omitting to
                  present you. Allow me, monsieur."</p>
               <p>A moment after, Wilford was enjoying the brilliant conversation of the most lovely
                  being his eyes ever rested on! At least, such was his present conviction.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">HELEN DE BRANDT.</head>
               <p>THE fair creature who had so singularly interested Wilford, was tall in form, but
                  of splendid figure, and the dress she wore exhibited her stature to excellent
                  advantage. Her hair was very dark, and her eyes were clearly blue, a curious
                  combination, and not common. She conversed fluently and gaily, but only in
                  French—a circumstance of some disadvantage to Wilford, who could as yet manage the
                  language but indifferently.</p>
               <p>The brilliant beauty was constantly surrounded by courtiers and flatterers, for
                  each and all of whom she seemed to have a ready <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon
                     mot</foreign>, preferring none, but rather dispensing her jests, her
                  attentions, and her favors to all around her, alike.</p>
               <p>Wilford was in raptures with her wit and her charms—and but for her height of
                  figure, her freshened color, and his knowledge that Nelly had long sine departed,
                  he would have sworn—at first sight—that Nelly Noell stood before him!</p>
               <p>"Do you not observe the resemblance, Manfred?" he earnestly inquired of his
                  friend, who came up soon after his introduction. "The mouth, the eyes, the
                  chin—her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tout ensemble</foreign>—upon my oath, it is very
                  like our lost Nelly."</p>
               <p>Manfred smiled.</p>
               <p>"Really, Wilford," he said, "your charming Nell is strongly impressed upon your
                  imagination! You make Madonnas and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chefs-d'ouvre</foreign>
                  of her at home, and you transform all the beautiful girls you chance to meet into
                  fresh Nelly Noells. You have a happy fancy, to be sure!"</p>
               <p>"But, surely, you can see the similitude, Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"I am not a painter, and cannot <emph>create</emph> images like yourself,
                  Wilford."</p>
               <p>"True. But you will admit that—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I admit there is a likeness. But Nelly's hair was golden—madam's is
                  chestnut. Nelly was not so tall, nor of this wax-work style of beauty. Nelly was
                  rugged and ruddy, not so pale and artificial. At any rate, Nelly was not the
                  daughter of the Marquis de Brandt, miboy, a personage very different, in my
                  limited experience, to a light-keeper's daughter. Ha, ha! Wilford—this is curious
                  in you, upon my life!"</p>
               <p>Wilford was vanquished! He could not divest himself of the feeling that so
                  remarkable a resemblance was scarcely possible, and yet the proof of the fact was
                  before his eyes. He sought the hand of Helen for the waltz, and she graciously
                  honored him. As he swept through the dreamy whirl, to dulcet tones of music, and
                  clasped her delicate zone, how did the thrill of ecstacy rush to his heart, while
                  he looked into those sweet blue eyes, so like the long-lost Nelly's!</p>
               <p>Wilford was in love! Impetuous as he had been on another occasion, when he vowed
                  himself the adorer of Charlotte Simplon, he would now be equally rash, and was
                  ready, ay! anxious for the appropriate opportunity to throw himself at the
                  beautiful Helen's feet, and own himself her slave. So fascinating was her manner,
                  so free and unconcerned her demeanor, who, least of all, seemed by her conduct to
                  be in the slightest degree conscious of her rare attractions, that Wilford would
                  have sank before her, in presence of all the world, and acknowledged himself
                  conquered by her charms.</p>
               <p>Wilford was determined! He looked the ground over, hastily, but like an
                  accomplished general. Helen was the proud daughter of a noble house, whose wealth
                  was untold, whose position was among the aristocracy of France. In herself, she
                  was worthy the hand of a prince, and could command a match among the first
                  families of the kingdom. Wilford was poor in purse, but wealthy in talent. He was
                  obscure in family lineage, but he had a self-made and enviable fame. He was
                  without title, a plain citizen, who made no pretence to blood or fortune, yet he
                  possessed a whole heart, a clear head, and a nobleness of purpose, such as was
                  rarely found combined in ordinary mortals. He resolved to win the fair being who
                  had thus suddenly entranced him, and he did not hesitate so to inform young
                  Manfred, his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">confidante</foreign> and friend.</p>
               <p>The Marquise de Brandt was an observing man, notwithstanding his seeming rigidity
                  of manner. And he was not alone in marking the palpable impression which his
                  beautiful daughter had made on the young artist. If he had been displeased with
                  Wilford's manifold attentions, he would not have hesitated an instant in giving
                  the impetuous young man frank notice of it. As it was, he said to himself—"he is a
                  bold fellow, that same Wilford, and may be trusted." The painter's battle was half
                  won, already!</p>
               <p>"Courage, miboy—courage, Wilford!" exclaimed-Manfred, as he met him an hour or two
                  later, "you are favored far above your fellows. Onward! You have a fair field, a
                  noble start, and you must win!"</p>
               <p>"She's an angel, Manfred."</p>
               <p>"Made up of blue eyes, a pearly skin, fair neck and rosy lips, miboy—an angel of
                  good substantial flesh and blood! You are excusable in this affair. Really, I
                  sympathize with you. She is a prize. Win her and wear her, if you can; she is
                  worthy of your madness!"</p>
               <p>The fete concluded with a superb and costly dinner. Young Wilford sat on the right
                  of his accomplished inamorata, and Manfred found it convenient and agreeable to be
                  seated beside the fair Hortense, her younger sister. The marquise was affable and
                  pleasant, the marchioness was indefatigable in her efforts to please her guests,
                  and when the party at last broke up, the fashionable world pronounced the
                  entertainment, par excellence, the most perfectly <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >recherche</foreign> affair of the year in Paris.</p>
               <p>The artist and his companion were among the very last at the leave-taking. If
                  Wilford had not made an impression, he felt that it had been for no fault in his
                  own efforts. He was aware of the ordinary difficulties attending his perilous
                  enterprise, but he had fairly launched his boat, and he believed he could so
                  navigate his bark as to reach the desired haven with a moral degree of
                  certainty.</p>
               <p>He had never stopped to inquire whether the charming Helen were under any other
                  possible engagement, he did not think of asking himself, or any one else, whether
                  she were already affianced. She was single, he loved her, wildly, and he flattered
                  himself that he could secure her to himself, against any and all odds!</p>
               <p>They parted. Wilford returned to his labors forthwith, for his "Madonna" must be
                  completed in a few days, the three months since it was ordered having well nigh
                  expired.</p>
               <p>"Who do you think the likeness here most favors, Wilford?" asked Manfred, a few
                  days after the fete, pointing to Nelly's portrait in his friend's room.</p>
               <p>Wilford smiled, and did not reply.</p>
               <p>"It really looks like de Brandt's daughter. A few touches here and there would
                  make it perfect. Make an <emph>Helen</emph> of it, Wilford."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my friend—but I prefer the original," said the artist, "if I can get
                  it."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE LIGHT-KEEPER'S TREASURE.</head>
               <p>WE must go back, once more, to the night when Harry Noell embarked on board his
                  yacht at Beachy Point, after placing in the hold of the Waif his newly acquired
                  and enormous treasure.</p>
               <p>It will be remembered that the light-keeper did not waste any time in gathering
                  together much property that had previously belonged to him. He got the gold and
                  silver aboard and snugly stowed, and then summoning his daughter, who took such
                  clothing only as was necessary for change of dress, and they put to sea with a
                  week's provisions, bidding a final and eternal adieu to the ragged shore where
                  they had dwelt so long, and labored so hard.</p>
               <p>The wind blew fresh from the northwest, and as soon as all sail was set that he
                  could carry, Noell put away before it down the coast, uncertain where he should
                  halt, or what he should do, after clearing the British jurisdiction. His first act
                  was to remove the gilded scroll that bore the name of Waif under the stern of his
                  vessel, and his next was to explain himself to his daughter.</p>
               <p>"Nelly," he said, "we shall return to Beachy Head no more."</p>
               <p>"What, father—never return?"</p>
               <p>"Never, daughter; listen to me. You have been a witness to what has recently
                  happened at the light—how the two men were drugged and pinioned, and how busy I
                  have since been, up to the moment we were ready to leave the point."</p>
               <p>"I knew that something strange had occurred, but I have no idea, even now, of the
                  reasons which prompted you to use them as you did."</p>
               <p>"I will tell you. For seven long weeks those two villains have deceived us. While
                  they pretended to be government officers, they were only robbers, who, by some
                  singular, and to me unknown means, obtained a knowledge of the burial of an
                  immense treasure, beneath our very roof—have been employed in digging up the
                  earth, in their secret apartment, where they at length discovered and secured the
                  wished-for valuables, which they got in complete readiness, to-night, to bear
                  away. This afternoon I sought to examine the premises, during their temporary
                  absence at the village, and found it as I have thus hastily explained to you—a
                  massive heap of gold and silver—of almost incredible value!"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?"</p>
               <p>"You shall see, anon. Amidst my astonishment and terror—for so much wealth alarmed
                  me, Nelly—and while I gazed on the jars, and chests and boxes of coin and precious
                  stones before me, I suddenly heard approaching footsteps. I turned around, heard a
                  loud oath muttered, and saw two pistols in the hands of those men, levelled at my
                  breast! '<emph>Stand!</emph>' they cried, '<emph>or you die!</emph>' I owned that
                  my curiosity had carried me too far, offered to keep their secret, and proposed to
                  them to share their spoils, since it had been found under my roof, and had cost
                  them only a few days' labor to secure it—but they rejected my offers, and allowed
                  me, magnanimously, to depart with my life! I entered the house, thought of the
                  narcotic, drugged their wine—and, you know the rest."</p>
               <p>"But where are we bound?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I had forgot. During the evening, while you slept, I removed the ballast
                  from the yacht, and placed every coin, every jewel, safely in the hold of the
                  Waif. The men still slept—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Only</emph> slept, father?"</p>
               <p>"Only slept, daughter—there is no fear on that score. It is a powerful opiate, and
                  sudden in its effect; but they cannot be harmed by it, after a few hours. I say
                  while they still slept, I called you, we embarked, and we shall never return again
                  to Beachy Head. If the property be not mine, it is not theirs; and I will be
                  avenged on them."</p>
               <p>"How great is its value, father?" asked Nelly.</p>
               <p>"I have not the remotest idea. I have secured it all, and I assume the
                  responsibility of the act, alone, my daughter. Never allude to it, if possible,
                  from this hour. Confide in my discretion, as you have ever done, and leave the
                  event to me."</p>
               <p>The wind favored them, and, after eight days' sail, they run into a small port on
                  the southerly coast of France. Here a few rough casks and boxes were procured, and
                  the treasure was landed in safety. The yacht was sold to a band of smugglers at a
                  good round sum, and Noell disappeared with his daughter and his booty. Before
                  quitting this place, he met with the account of the burning of the light, and had
                  the opportunity of smiling at the suspicions that had been excited in regard to
                  the fate of himself and Nelly! This was a fortunate turn to the affair, and he
                  availed himself of the advantages it presented for his future safety. He proceeded
                  to Lisbon, then to Madrid, at each place, through means of the wealthy Jews there,
                  succeeded in reducing his bulk of gold and silver, and from time to time turning
                  his jewels and effects into cash or bills of credit, until all was disposed of,
                  and he found himself rich almost beyond calculation. He finally left Madrid, and
                  nothing more was known of him for a long period of time.</p>
               <p>The two pretended officials of the British government, who came so near to being
                  "gentlemen of fortune," arrived at Dover and quickly made their way towards the
                  north, with what little they had contrived to secure to themselves, lest they
                  should be tracked by the authorities, and caged for forgery. The captain received
                  an injury soon after, by falling from his horse, while on a marauding expedition,
                  and died from the wound. The lieutenant abandoned his swindling life, and became a
                  better member of society, ultimately—but he never saw or heard of the light-keeper
                  from the hour he was drugged at Beachy Head.</p>
               <p>The Marquis de Brandt had been a widower for some years. While sojourning,
                  temporarily, at Marseilles, he met with a blooming widow, with two children and a
                  splendid fortune, and he wooed and won her. He had but one child of his own—Helen,
                  whom we have already described—and the union of the two families proved a happy
                  and congenial one. The marquis was very rich, in his own right; the united
                  fortunes of Madame Dessaret and his own placed them among the wealthiest families
                  in all Europe, and we have seen how they lived, and how they dispensed the income
                  of the splendid means they enjoyed.</p>
               <p>It will be remembered by the reader that the letter which Noell had left in the
                  light-house, and which he supposed would find its way to the person whom he
                  desired to take temporary charge of the premises, in some manner, very soon after
                  he left was destroyed by the malicious captain, who fired the buildings. As it
                  never reached its intended destination, all knowledge of the fate of Noell from
                  that night was thus obliterated, and the world supposing him dead soon forgot him
                  and his child. The Waif was repainted and so changed as not to be recognized,
                  subsequently, and all trace of the light-keeper, of Nelly, or of the yacht, was
                  permanently and effectually cut off.</p>
               <p>Wilford continued to apply himself vigorously to the work on which he had been
                  engaged for the strange lady, and a few days before the time expired at which it
                  was promised, the superb "Madonna" was completed and placed in readiness for
                  inspection and delivery to its owner.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE ADIEU.</head>
               <p>IMMEDIATELY after the splendid entertainment given by the Marquise de Brandt, a
                  round <choice>
                     <sic>o </sic>
                     <corr>of</corr>
                  </choice> elegant parties were put on the tapis, by the aristocracy of Paris—but
                  the establishment of the former was at once broken up, as they purposed to pass a
                  few weeks in Italy, prior to their return home, and the season was advancing.
                  Great was the regret of the numerous newly-made friends of the marquis and
                  marchioness, when this determination on their part was made public, but none were
                  more deeply affected by it than were young Wilford, and his friend Manfred.</p>
               <p>"This is unlucky," said the latter. "I had hoped the marquis would have tarried a
                  little time, here, with his beautiful family, and give us an opportunity to become
                  better acquainted with them. Besides, my father had arranged for it, and really
                  insists, that they shall visit Burton House this season.</p>
               <p>"That would have been delightful," said Wilford, "and I think—though I haven't had
                  the honor of an invitation yet, I should have gone over to England myself, for a
                  few days, under those circumstances."</p>
               <p>"You know you are always welcome to Burton House, miboy, and it doesn't need the
                  formality of a card for my early friend to find ready admittance there, whenever
                  he chooses. Of course, I intended you should join us—but they are positively off
                  for Florence, I learn, at once."</p>
               <p>"That is unfortunate, and <emph>I</emph> am disappointed. <emph>You</emph> need
                  have no particular feeling about it, however, Manfred."</p>
               <p>"Wilford, miboy, you are aware that I have had the opportunity of meeting with
                  scores of beautiful women, in my short experience, and you know that I have never
                  yet treated any one individual of the other sex with partiality. When I saw the
                  daughters of the lovely Marchioness de Brandt—the delicate Hortense and the
                  blooming Helen—I confess to you that I changed my mind. I do not now think that
                  all women are alike; there is a choice among them."</p>
               <p>Wilford started, perceptibly, at this altogether unexpected confession on the part
                  of his friend, and a paleness quickly overspread his handsome features, as he
                  rejoined:</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, Manfred!"</p>
               <p>"And why not, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—but, a—who, <emph>which</emph> one do you—I mean, do you really fancy either
                  of the daughters of de Brandt?"</p>
               <p>"I confess to you, I do."</p>
               <p>"And she will encourage you, Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"I have reason to think so. But what is all this tremor and sensation,
                  Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Manfred, which of the twain—"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear fellow! The loveliest and sweetest, in my estimation, of course. But
                  do not fear that I will attempt to gather the ripened fruit from <emph>your</emph>
                  vineyard. No, no! You have made your own selection, and I wish you godspeed in
                  your aim to win the hand of the sparkling and noble Helen."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, thanks—my good friend. Upon my honor, I would not be so startled again,
                  for half this province!" exclaimed Wilford, as he recovered from the suspicion
                  that Manfred, too, had fallen in love with his choice!</p>
               <p>"No. Hortense de Brandt is <emph>my</emph> bean ideal of a true-hearted and lovely
                  woman, Wilford. I am not titled, but in England, you know, money will purchase
                  anything, if it be necessary, and in all other respects, I am not unequal to her.
                  My fortune is and will be ample, and I have resolved to ask her hand in marriage,
                  at the appropriate opportunity."</p>
               <p>"I give you joy, Manfred, in advance, then. I could wish that <emph>my</emph>
                  fortune were what it is not! But, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nil
                     desperandum!</foreign> I will earn my fortune. And I think, Manfred, that
                  either Helen or Hortense de Brandt are too sound in good judgment, and too well
                  bred, to lay deep stress upon this 'property qualification,' <emph>alone</emph>,
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. But money is a very convenient thing, to be sure!"</p>
               <p>"You are right, miboy, when one can have a plenty of it. When do they break
                  up?"</p>
               <p>"Forthwith. I met the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">intendant</foreign> of the marquis
                  last evening, casually, and he informs me that they will remove within the present
                  week."</p>
               <p>"Is not this decision made in great haste?"</p>
               <p>"So it would seem, though I know little of their intended arrangements, save what
                  is publicly announced."</p>
               <p>"They will certainly allow us to pay them a parting call?"</p>
               <p>"That is what I would propose."</p>
               <p>"And you will soon return to Dover, Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, directly, for a few days. If you will join me, Wilford, I will proceed with
                  you in the wake of the de Brandts, next month."</p>
               <p>"To Florence?"</p>
               <p>"To Venice, first, and then to Florence, Rome, and Naples."</p>
               <p>"The very aim of my life!" exclaimed Wilford. "I have longed to visit the classic
                  ground of Raphael and his compeers, for many years. I will go with great
                  pleasure."</p>
               <p>"There is no other reason, of course, that would tempt you to visit this 'classic
                  ground,' just at this present time, I suppose, Wilford! O, no, of course not,"
                  said Manfred, playfully. "But come, miboy, brush up this evening, and we will call
                  at the Hotel Moncrieffe, and make our adieux to the family."</p>
               <p>Agreeably to appointment, the two friends were set down from a modest <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">caleche</foreign>, at the door of de Brandt's mansion, at a
                  rather early evening hour. Notwithstanding the supposed unseasonableness of the
                  time, they found the reception-rooms of the marquis thronged with company, who had
                  come on an errand similar to their own. The fair hostess was all smiles and
                  radiancy, and the marquis—though as formal and stiff as ever—was as gracious as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>The lovers had hoped for the opportunity, on this occasion, to be able to enjoy a
                  quiet <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tete</foreign> with the two young ladies of
                  whom they had become, at the same hour, enamored. But there was no such
                  opportunity afforded. Carriage arrived after carriage, and scores of the nobility
                  crowded upon each other, coming and going, until past midnight; but the lovers had
                  only the privilege of doing and saying whatever the rest of the multitude were
                  equally permitted to do and say, until their "call" had been protracted long
                  beyond the period recognized by the rules of polite etiquette, and they were
                  obliged reluctantly to take their leave, without making any demonstration
                  whatever.</p>
               <p>Wilford ventured to take the hand of Helen de Brandt in his own, at the moment of
                  retiring, and was bold enough to say, in bad French:</p>
               <p>"Adieu, ma'amoiselle. We have greatly enjoyed the society of yourself and your
                  noble father's agreeable family, and have only to regret that your stay at Paris
                  has been, unfortunately, so very brief. I trust that we shall soon have the
                  happiness to meet you again."</p>
               <p>"Adieu, monsieur!" said the beauty, winningly, still resting her beautiful hand in
                  the grasp of the artist, "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">nous allons d'Italie. <choice>
                        <sic>J'ia</sic>
                        <corr>J'ai</corr>
                     </choice> beaucoup de reconnaisance pour votre attention. Adieu! jusqu' au
                     revoir.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>Farewell, Manfred," added Hortense, good-naturedly, "if you visit Naples or
                  Florence this season, pray find us. We shall be absent three months or more, and
                  then you will surely come to our chateau, if we do not see you, meantime?"</p>
               <p>Wilford kissed the hand of Helen de Brandt, and the two young gentlemen retired,
                  in the happiest possible mood.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE BEGGAR GIRL OF THE PONT DES FLEURS.</head>
               <p>THE family of de Brandt had been gone several days, and Manfred had returned to
                  England. Wilford was alone in his studio, and as the time had come round when his
                  Madonna was to have been ready, he looked for the return of the lady who had
                  ordered it. Prompt in his own share of the contract, the picture was duly
                  finished; and on the morning that the time expired, a carriage halted again before
                  his door, from which emerged his strange patron, who immediately entered his
                  apartment, accompanied as before by her liveried attendant.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Bonjour,</foreign> monsieur! I am happy to see you," she
                  said. "I hope you have found leisure to complete the picture I ordered, three
                  months ago to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Madame, I did not forget my promise. The subject, you remember, you left to my
                  own selection. I chose the 'Madonna,' after a conception of my own, and I am happy
                  to say that it is completed. Will it please you to examine it?"</p>
               <p>The artist felt not a little pride in pointing the lady to his recent admirable
                  effort, which he considered the best composition he had ever executed. "Here it
                  is, madame."</p>
               <p>The lady did not raise her veil—a performance that Wilford most earnestly desired
                  and watched for—but stood for a moment fixed, as a statue, before the beautiful
                  design.</p>
               <p>"Monsieur 1" she exclaimed, after a moment's pause, "you have outdone yourself. It
                  is exquisite, everything that I could have wished. But, I observe, you have
                  preserved the likeness I so much coveted."</p>
               <p>"Because I fancied it would please you better, and I know of no features that
                  would better carry out my design."</p>
               <p>"You did well, monsieur; I am more than satisfied. Make your own price upon it. My
                  steward will wait on you with a check for the amount, and remove the picture,
                  directly," and the lady turned to go.</p>
               <p>"Might I venture to ask madame's address?" said Wilford, politely.</p>
               <p>"I am a stranger in Paris, monsieur, a friend of the Countess de Charmand, who
                  will inform you further, if you apply to her. I am travelling, in cog.: and have
                  no permanent address at present. My servant will call on you and take the Madonna,
                  at evening. Good day, Monsieur Wilford."</p>
               <p>The lady had gone!</p>
               <p>Half an hour afterwards, a porteress knocked at his door, and inquired, "is this
                  Monsieur Wilford, the artist?"</p>
               <p>"Walk in," said the painter, "I am Wilford."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, monsieur, I will not tarry. Here is a note which 'the lady in black'
                  requested me to hand to you."</p>
               <p>"What lady did you say?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know <emph>who</emph> she is; all we know was that she lodged with us at
                  our hotel, for a few days, and was known as <emph>the lady in black</emph>, from
                  her uniformly sombre attire. She paid her bills in advance, and we never ask
                  useless questions, you know, monsieur."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">C'est bien</foreign>" replied Wilford, handing the woman
                  a half crown piece.</p>
               <p>"This is twice I have been paid for this service," said the porteress, chuckling
                  to herself, quietly, and retiring.</p>
               <p>Wilford saw that it was in Marie's hand-writing, but he had long since given up
                  the idea of ferreting her out by asking questions of her instruments of
                  communication. He could learn nothing from these people, who were either ignorant
                  or were interdicted by their employer, and so he proceeded to read this last
                  missive from his unknown but zealous friend.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Wilford;</emph>—this is the last favor you will receive from the hands of
                  that Marie who loves you. There is no longer room in your heart for remembrance of
                  the poor beggar-girl whom you once befriended, and who had fondly hoped that you
                  might not advance with such rapid strides in fortune's path as to be forgetful
                  that <emph>she</emph> still existed, and in secret worshipped you!</p>
               <p>"Your head is turned, Wilford! The pomp and glitter of fashion, the pamperings of
                  nobility, the success which your genius and your talents have commanded, a pair of
                  melting blue eyes and the dainty skin of the daughter of a marquis have vanquished
                  you. You are no longer the struggling painter, depending upon his daily exertions
                  for his bread, for fortune has smiled on you, and fame, station, riches are and
                  will be your reward.</p>
               <p>"Little thought had you for poor Marie, when the titled and the wealthy crowded
                  around, and caressed you. Why should you have? It is not in nature to unite oil
                  and water. Your tastes and inclinations and aims, were different, and your objects
                  are well-nigh gained. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">N'importe</foreign>, monsieur! You
                  are right. Pursue the path you have chosen, follow up the prize held out to you,
                  and in the person of Helen de Brandt, find one who is prouder and more worthy of
                  your love than the humble <emph>Marie?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"You would know who <emph>is</emph> 'Marie.' Once, forever, let me answer your
                  often-asked question. You imagine that the person whom you twice met upon the Pont
                  des Fleurs, the beggar-girl, was the same. This is an error. The
                     <emph>first</emph> one was in the employ of the other, and she took this method
                  of communicating with you, for reasons of her own. Since then, she has adopted her
                  own way to confer with you. She sought to examine into your disposition, and
                  satisfy herself whether or not you were what she believed and hoped you were. On
                  this point she is now content. When you least expected it, 'poor Marie' has since
                  and often been near you. She has dared to love you, not for your fame, your
                  prospective future, or the honors that might accrue to you—but for
                     <emph>yourself,</emph> alone!</p>
               <p>"You have given your heart to Helen de Brandt—be it so! But, have a care, O,
                  Alfred Wilford! Suffer not the dazzling fortunes, the admitted beauty of even
                  Helen de Brandt to intoxicate you, unless you prove her truth. Is she worthy of
                  your affections? Is she gentle, loving, truthful, and will she be devoted to your
                  future happiness, when she shall have had time to realize that she has taken to
                  her arms the 'poor artist,' only, though she might have been wedded to a prince?
                  Think of all this, and step with caution.</p>
               <p>"Marie will still love you, and will watch over you. You do not know her yet, but
                  one day you shall see her, face to face. Hitherto you have deemed her poor and
                  obscure, though you have treated her disguise with respect. Know, now, that the
                  Marie who addresses you through this means, for the last time, Wilford, has been
                  nearer to you than you have ever dreamed, and has listened to your plaudits of the
                  Nelly Noell whom you should have learned to love in life! That Marie has heard you
                  laud the charms of the poor light-keeper's child, whose image you so carefully
                  preserve in your heart and in your studio. That Marie, believe me, Wilford, whom
                  you have been so curious to meet, who loves you so devotedly, and who would gladly
                  share with you her ample fortune—were it not too late! that 'Marie' is the recent
                  purchaser of your 'Madonna,' the veiled stranger in black—who, though she will
                  still continue to be your friend, and will hereafter make herself known to you—now
                  bids you a regretful <foreign xml:lang="FRA">adieu!</foreign> and with a prayer
                  for your continued prosperity and happiness, subscribes herself once more,
                  MARIE."</p>
               <p>"Zounds and confusion!" exclaimed the painter, "I will give a thousand crowns to
                  meet this 'Marie' once more!"</p>
               <p>But the "lady in black" had disappeared, the<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000026"/> "Madonna" had been paid for and instantly removed,
                  the porteress had gone, and Wilford was more in the dark than ever as to this
                  mysterious and now strangely liberal "beggar!"</p>
               <p>He turned back the leaves of his memory, and saw how interwoven was the receipt of
                  all the letters from "Marie," in connection with the lady in black or her
                  servants, and he was satisfied that her story was genuine. But what could have
                  been her object in thus mystifying the matter? Why a beggar-girl and then a lady
                  of nobility? Still he studied, but he obtained no satisfactory reply.</p>
               <p>"I shall know her hereafter," says Marie. "Well that is some comfort. I will wait,
                  dear Marie, I will wait!"</p>
               <p>In the hurry to get away from Paris, the marquis did not call at Wilford's studio
                  as he proposed, and he sent the artist the following apology.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MEETING IN VENICE.</head>
               <p>THE family of the Marquis de Brandt had been sojourning in Venice and Naples
                  several weeks, and near three months had elapsed since they left Paris. Their
                  style of living had been splendid, as was their custom, and during their visit in
                  Italy they had passed the time gaily and sumptuously. One evening as the sun was
                  setting amidst all the glory of a southern sky, there arrived at the Hotel
                  Anglaiterre two gentlemen, with a single male servant. They were modest in their
                  bearing and attire, and little notice was accorded to them by the strange crowd
                  around them.</p>
               <p>The burthen of the conversation appeared to be devoted to the magnificent
                  liberality of the marquis and his family, and to the singular deportment and
                  questionable objects of a single other person who had engrossed a considerable
                  share of public notice. This latter was a female, who was attended by a secretary
                  and four or five <foreign xml:lang="FRA">attaches</foreign>, and she was only
                  known by the title of the "Lady in sables."</p>
               <p>She was tall and graceful in person, but was exceedingly reserved in her
                  intercourse with any one beyond her own attendants. Occasionally she had been seen
                  to speak, briefly, with the family of the marquis, but she was known to none
                  others, and the mystery of her habits and hearing caused much remark, though none
                  knew whence she came, or who she could be.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon the arrival of the two young men above spoken of—who booked
                  themselves as Manfred and Wilford—they booked about to learn if the De Brandts
                  were in town, and were gratified to learn that they had been domiciled in Venice,
                  some three weeks. The next day as they were on the point of passing out of the
                  hotel, for the purpose of paying their respects to the marchioness, a lady in deep
                  black entered a beautiful carriage near by, whose form was instantly recognized by
                  Wilford as his late mysterious patron in Paris!</p>
               <p>"By Jove, Manfred!" exclaimed the artist, springing forward to obtain a view of
                  the carriage, or the lady, or both, "there goes the purchaser of my Madonna."</p>
               <p>"And what of all that?" responded Manfred, who knew nothing of the particular
                  circum stances of that ease, and who could therefore see no reason why his friend
                  should quite 'jump out of his skin.' "What if it is, miboy! Don't make yourself an
                  object of remark, in public, in this way. Suppose she did buy your Madonna?"</p>
               <p>"Suppose she <emph>did?</emph> Ah! miboy, you don't know her story."</p>
               <p>"Do <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No. But I would give a round sum to find it out, to be sure."</p>
               <p>"Well, she is gone for the present."</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5956-00000027"/>
               <p>"So I observe. That is her carriage, too, the same I noticed before the door of my
                  studio in Paris."</p>
               <p>"Here's an adventure to begin with, then."</p>
               <p>"You shall see, Manfred. Do you remember my mentioning the beggar girl of the Pont
                  des Fleurs?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"That is she!"</p>
               <p>"Who?"</p>
               <p>"The lady in black."</p>
               <p>"Well, who is the lady in black?"</p>
               <p>"Why, <emph>Marie</emph>, to be sure."</p>
               <p>"Marie! This is another one, then."</p>
               <p>"Well, understand me, now. You heard our neighbors here speak of the 'lady in
                  sables,' have you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, as we stepped from our hotel, I over-heard the remark from one of our
                  countrymen, 'there she is again.' I looked, and beheld the purchaser of my
                  Madonna, whose face I never saw, and whom I knew only as the 'lady in black,'
                  until I received a note from the beggar girl—as I suppose—and signed Marie,
                  informing me that she had doubly disguised her intercourse with me, and that
                  herself and my patron were the same person. Do you think I am not anxious to know
                  her?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I am not surprised. But, will you succeed?"</p>
               <p>"I shall try, assuredly."</p>
               <p>"How will you commence?"</p>
               <p>"I will call upon her."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"That remains to be ascertained," said Wilford; "but I shall contrive it. She has
                  slipped me several times, and if she doesn't know that I am in Venice, I shall be
                  certain to carry my point. I cannot conceive why she preserves this curious
                  deportment towards me, inasmuch as her letters to me—if it be the same person—over
                  the signature of 'Marie,' were burthened with good wishes and earnest sentiments
                  of solicitude in my especial behalf."</p>
               <p>"You have corresponded with her, then?"</p>
               <p>Wilford explained the whole of his romantic secret, to his friend, who concluded
                  that were he precisely in Wilford's situation, he should feel precisely as the
                  artist did, without any doubt.</p>
               <p>"And when you meet this strange woman, and learn all about her, if you effect it,"
                  asked Manfred, "what will you have gained?"</p>
               <p>"That is in the future, too, my boy. But here we are."</p>
               <p>The friends had reached the temporary residence of the Marquis de Brandt, where
                  they intended to call.</p>
               <p>They found only the marchioness and Hortense, at leisure—Helen having accompanied
                  her father out to examine some of the picture galleries. The ladies were delighted
                  to see messieurs in Venice, where they had enjoyed their sojourn very pleasantly,
                  and the fair marquise and the fairer Hortense never looked more charmingly.
                  Manfred was especially pleased, and accepted their invitation to be social during
                  his stay in Venice, with marked satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Helen will be glad to meet you here, monsieur," said the marchioness, addressing
                  Wilford, kindly, "and will be disappointed that you should not find her at
                  home."</p>
               <p>With promises to call again, early, the young gentlemen left. As they turned from
                  the door, the carriage of the strange lady halted at the portal of the
                  marquis.</p>
               <p>"There she is, again!" said Wilford, to his friend. "This is unlucky, to be sure.
                  Had we tarried a moment longer, we might have had an introduction, without further
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>"Hadn't you better return?" said Manfred, provokingly.</p>
               <p>Wilford knew better than to permit his zeal to urge him to overstep the bounds of
                  etiquette, so ridiculously, and he turned towards his lodgings, not a little
                  annoyed with his morning's ill success.</p>
               <p>"I am at a loss to conceive why this beggar, or princess, or whoever she may be,"
                  added Wilford, "should take this singular interest in my temporal affairs, and at
                  the same time exhibit such wilful shyness about it all. If there were any reason
                  why she should follow me, and advise me, and pay me extravagant sums for my
                  pictures, and all that, I don't understand why she shouldn't permit me to know
                  exactly who and what she is. Do you, Manfred?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot answer for her facetiousness."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Facetious!</emph> Do you call it thus?"</p>
               <p>"Eccentricity then, miboy How do you like that?"</p>
               <p>"Bah! Manfred, you are a queer fellow. But what strikes me as strangely as all the
                  rest, is, that she happens to be in Venice, when I get here! Why shouldn't she
                  have been in Paris, or anywhere else?"</p>
               <p>"True—but I presume she will explain everything thing to your satisfaction, if you
                  are ever so lucky as to catch her again," said Manfred.</p>
               <p>"But we can learn of her, easily, at de Brandts," replied Wilford, suddenly,
                  thinking of this plan of inquiry.</p>
               <p>"Have a care there, miboy!" suggested Manfred. "Ask no foolish questions in that
                  quarter, about this woman. You will have to explain, perhaps; and what will a
                  certain 'demoiselle say, do you think, if you disclose your apparent intrigue,
                  there?"</p>
               <p>They reached their lodgings, and immediately Wilford learned that a curious card
                  had been left for him during his absence. He looked at it, and a simple black
                  mark, thus — appeared upon it, with the address, "HOTEL FRANCAIS, at 11 P. M."
                  Here was more mystery!</p>
               <p>"What do you make out of that?" asked Wilford.</p>
               <p>"It is from your <emph>sable</emph> friend, the beggar," said Manfred, coolly.
                  "You will obey the summons, of course. Perhaps she will turn out to be an officer
                  of the Inquisition, in disguise. Call, miboy, by all means."</p>
               <p>Wilford was confounded.</p>
               <p>"Or, it may be," continued Manfred, "that she only wants her portrait painted, and
                  desires to give you a fresh commission. You will thus be enabled to see her, 'face
                  to face,' without being called upon to invest a 'thousand crowns' in the
                  operation."</p>
               <p>"You are perfectly heartless in this matter, Manfred. But, I <emph>will</emph> go.
                  I am determined upon seeing her face, at any rate."</p>
               <p>"Go on, miboy, I wish you all success. I have no doubt she will prove an angel, or
                  a sprite, or something between the two. Go, by all means."</p>
               <p>And Wilford <emph>did</emph> go, as the card indicated.</p>

                  once to the door of a large room, outside of which there stood two servants,
                  dressed in the identical livery he had twice seen in Paris, when his wealthy
                  patron called upon him. To one of these, without a word, he handed a card with
                     "<hi rend="i"/>Wilford" engraved upon it.</p>
               <p>"Enter monsieur," said the attendant, instantly, and with an earnest politeness.
                  The door opened, and closed quickly—and the artist found himself entirely alone,
                  in a long drawing-room which was richly-furnished, and which opened into another
                  apartment beyond it. This atter room seemed to be brilliantly lighted, and, as he
                  left the first door he had entered, a servant girl came across the apartment,
                  pointed him to the elegantly curtained <unclear>archway that</unclear> led into
                  the inner room, or parlor—and said, as she passed out:</p>
               <p>"Madame awaits you—walk in, monsieur."</p>
               <p>The curtain was immediately drawn noiselessly aside, and a perfect gush of
                  brilliant light burst upon the sight of the startled artist, as he entered this
                  magnificently appointed apartment. The gorgeousness of the room, the superb
                  furniture, its rich velvety carpet and massive curtains, its profusion of divans,
                  lounges, and costly mirrors, struck the young artist with surprise and admiration,
                  because he had made no calculations upon being so sumptuously received. But his
                  attention was very quickly attracted from the furnishings to the only occupant of
                  the room.</p>
               <p>A woman of commanding and graceful figure approached him, as he advanced fairly
                  into the room, and in exquisite French, said:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur Wilford, you are very welcome. Pray be seated;" and she pointed him to
                  an inviting lounge at the side of the spacious apartment.</p>
               <p>She was attired in a magnificent black satin dress, cut low at the shoulders, her
                  arms were bare, save where a rich diamond bracelet clasped the splendidly rounded
                  wrist, and about her throat, and pendant upon her snow-white bosom, hung a string
                  of heavy pearls. A rich girdle of pearls was also suspended around her zone, and a
                  shawl of pure Mechlin hung loosely on her left arm. A complete domino concealed
                  her entire features, however; and, except that he observed her flowing ringlets
                  were deep brown— he could not discover a single lineament of the lady's face.</p>
               <p>"I heard you had arrived in town," said the lady, pleasantly, "and I sent you my
                  address. I thank you for your prompt attention."</p>
               <p>"I am rather your debtor, madame, for this honor," said Wilford.</p>
               <p>"I sent for you, monsieur, to explain a trifling riddle to you, at least, an
                  enigma as it has seemed to you; and to order another picture, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"You are very kind, madame. May I not, without giving you offence, at the outset
                  ask whom I now have the honor of speaking with?"</p>
               <p>"No offence, Wilford—but, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pardonnez moi!</foreign> I
                  cannot answer that at present. I have a desire to be convinced by you in reference
                  to one or two matters which deeply concern both you and me, whether I am rightly
                  informed or not; and I wish to explain to your own satisfaction another matter in
                  which I am implicated. When this is done, you shall know my name and station,
                  without scruple or delay."</p>
               <p>"But you are '<emph>Marie</emph>,' are you not?"</p>
               <p>"Marie, if you will, then—yes, for the time being. That was my <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">nom de guerre</foreign>, for the occasion."</p>
               <p>"And the beggar-girl of the Pont des Fleurs?" said Wilford.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and no. Once I was there, in person, attended by a friend close at hand. At
                  the other meeting, an employee of mine assumed the garb, to arrest your particular
                  notice, and to try your charity. Thus begun, I assumed the name of Marie, and from
                  that time I continued to carry out my design."</p>
               <p>"And what was your final object?"</p>
               <p>"You shall see, monsieur. Men are treacherous creatures! I do not mean making this
                  a sweeping charge against <emph>all</emph> men, for there is no rule without its
                  exception. Still, I repeat, men are inconstant and unstable."</p>
               <p>"And women?" queried Wilford, mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and women, too," acknowledged the fair speaker. "But, in your case, I
                  learned, no matter <emph>how</emph>, that you had become attached to the image or
                  the reality of a poor penniless girl who adored you, and whom you would have
                  wedded, probably, but for her indigence and your own."</p>
               <p>"Was not madame misinformed?" asked Wilford, at this announcement.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I was; your heart will tell you, Wilford."</p>
               <p>"But, I assure you—"</p>
               <p>"You need not assure me, monsieur. Listen, and I will tell you the history of the
                  affair. You loved one Nelly Noell, but neither you nor she knew it, seasonably.
                  You met her in poverty, when you also was as poor as she. Am I right?"</p>
               <p>"Proceed, madame."</p>
               <p>"She loved you—how devotedly and warmly, you never knew. You met her, I say, under
                  adverse circumstances, you left her to mourn your departure and your subsequent
                  absence. You did not forget her, but she could not speak her love, and when you
                  came to think and feel how dear she <emph>might</emph> have been to you, it was
                  too late, for Nelly was lost to you!"</p>
               <p>A sigh escaped young Wilford's lips, in spite of himself.</p>
               <p>"You came to Paris, and placed her sweet image upon canvass, as you remembered
                  her, and O, <emph>how</emph> faithfully! I saw your gem of art, and would have
                  purchased it; but <emph>then</emph>, from your own lips, I learned how deeply you
                  prized the counterpart, when the original had passed beyond your reach!"</p>
               <p>"I own it, madame."</p>
               <p>"'Tis well. Scarce half a year had passed, when you suddenly met with a lady high
                  in station, whom you swore resembled Nelly, and so strongly that you must fall in
                  love with her at sight!"</p>
               <p>"The Lady Helen was fortunate in possessing such a face, madame, else I might have
                  passed her as I had a thousand other brilliant women, and even have been content
                  with my poor Marie," said Wilford, romantically.</p>
               <p>"Fie, monsieur! Had the lady no charms save of face and form? Was she not the
                  proud daughter of a marquis? Were you her peer? Where was your discrimination and
                  your love of such beauty only, when you saw and fled from the light-keeper's
                  daughter?"</p>
               <p>"The charm of station, nobility, wealth, madame—may be surroundings of advantage
                  to a lovely woman, in the eyes of some connoisseurs, but a beautiful and costly
                  framing around an indifferent or unworthy picture, would not please my taste, or
                  satisfy my desires!"</p>
               <p>"Well, let that pass. You see a resemblance in her face to that of Nelly, and you
                  love her. Would you wed her, Wilford?"</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5956-00000029"/>
               <p>This query, so directly given, took the young man by surprise.</p>
               <p>"Madame!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Monsieur," she replied; "I asked you fairly, would you wed this lady?"</p>
               <p>"And I answer, madame—that I—I am—"</p>
               <p>"Surprised at my impertinence," continued the lady, finishing the sentence for
                  him. "Well then, you need not answer this—but let me now add what I most desire to
                  confess to you."</p>
               <p>"I am all attention, lady."</p>
               <p>"Wilford," she continued, "the circumstances of the case will plead excuse for my
                  forgetfulness of self and sex, in this admission. We are alone, here, and no ear
                  but yours can hear what I have to say. I have watched your course for a long
                  period, and I have loved you, as you have already been made aware, as woman rarely
                  loves a man! You cannot see my face, but it is not perhaps displeasing. I am
                  wealthy, youthful, guiltless of thought or deed in life that ill becomes a woman,
                  beloved by none and loving none but you; and I would fill that place within your
                  heart which Nelly would have occupied, had you but owned her while you might."</p>
               <p>"Madame—I—"</p>
               <p>"My fortune is ample, I am mistress of a million in my own right. I lay my heart
                  and means at your disposal, before you have proposed to Helen; and have been,
                  perhaps, <emph>rejected!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Madame! <unclear>Marie</unclear>, whoever you may be, I can only say that I owe
                  you much, and would requite the love you so generously have confessed, but—"</p>
               <p>"You love the brilliant Helen better, monsieur?" continued the strange lady,
                  wildly.</p>
               <p>"My heart is gone, Marie, gone, out of my own keeping."</p>
               <p>"And Helen de Brandt possesses it?"</p>
               <p>"Do not press me farther, but pardon my preference."</p>
               <p>"Go then, monsieur, I have done! I had forgotten myself, I have shamed my sex. I
                  flattered my poor heart that yours was not a flint! In my plenitude of confidence
                  and affection, I lost sight of my womanhood, and you discard me. Be it so. We
                  shall meet no more. Respect the secresy that should attach to an interview like
                  this, remember me only as 'poor Marie,' and be assured that she will still pray
                  for your happiness even in the arms of Helen de Brandt!"</p>
               <p>The lady placed her 'kerchief convulsively to her lips, and with a sigh, rushed
                  from the apartment.</p>
               <p>A moment afterward, a servant entered and said:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur's carriage waits."</p>
               <p>Wilford started up, and quickly departed, overwhelmed with astonishment, confusion
                  and painful regrets at this unsought-for and remarkable interview.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE PROPOSAL.</head>
               <p>THE curious meeting described in our last chapter proved a serious damper upon the
                  ardor of young Wilford, in his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amour</foreign>. He now saw
                  that his talents, which had raised him so suddenly into notice at Paris was the
                  cause, probably, of this disagreeable episode in his life. It was a singular
                  result, but what would not a loving woman perform for the object of her earnest
                  affections? In this instance, a lady of rank and splendid fortune had assumed the
                  meanest of disguises, had followed clandestinely upon his heels for months, had
                  offered him her hand and means, without scruple and without encouragement, and all
                  at a venture! It was a case of madness!</p>
               <p>To Manfred's repeated and importunate inquiries, Wilford returned but the briefest
                  answers, assuring him that all should be explained in due time—but that his pledge
                  of honor prevented him from entering into details, at present, in reference to his
                  interview, on the day succeeding which, it was observed that the "lady in sables"
                  broke up her establishment, and peremptorily quitted Venice, without further
                  ceremony.</p>
               <p>The gloom temporarily caused by this incident was very quickly dissipated,
                  however, in Wilford's case, by his meeting with the de Brandts on the following
                  evening. The ever charming Helen and Hortense were more beautiful and more
                  interesting than usual, even. Time and distance from home improved both the fair
                  daughters, and the young companion-lovers made excellent progress in their suits.
                  A fortnight passed away, and the interviews between them had been happy and
                  frequent.</p>
               <p>Though no hint of suspicion as to the objects of Manfred and Wilford was given on
                  the part of the parents, yet the marquis and the marchioness were by no means
                  inattentive observers of what was evidently going on among the young people.</p>
               <p>"Do you observe the familiarity of Hortense and Manfred?" asked the marchioness of
                  her husband, one day when they were alone together.</p>
               <p>"Do you note the intimacy that is growing between Helen and young Wilford?"
                  responded her husband, quaintly, in reply.</p>
               <p>"Surely I cannot avoid it," said the lady. "Do you object to it, in any way?" she
                  added.</p>
               <p>"Not a whit—not a whit, by Jove! They are brave fellows, to be sure; and the girls
                  will wed somebody, sooner or later. Let them enjoy themselves, I will manage it
                  all to suit my wishes, and yours.</p>
               <p>"Manfred's family and fortune are not unequal to the position and means of our
                  Hortense," continued the marchioness. "But this Wilford<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000030"/> ford, what of him? Helen evidently favors him above
                  the scores of flatterers that continually surround her."</p>
               <p>"I see it all, and secretly rejoice at it, my dear. But we must not let her, or
                  him, know this at present. Time will prove the boy. I know his history. He is the
                  intimate friend of young Manfred, a talented but poor artist. He has been well
                  educated and possesses a good head and an honest heart, I think. I shall continue
                  to watch them, as you will, also; time, I say, will prove how worthy he may
                  be."</p>
               <p>A month elapsed, and the gay circle of friends and acquaintances who were
                  permitted to enjoy the society of the de Brandt family in Venice, had long since
                  decided in their own minds how matters were progressing. The beaux and courtiers
                  and fortune-hunters who flit about this match-making <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >locale</foreign>, had given up the chase, in favor of the two clearly favorite
                  winners; and the lovers seemed to be having the field entirely to themselves.
                  Manfred had already secretly declared himself to Hortense, who had blushingly
                  accepted his offer, subject to her parents' approval—and Wilford had gone so far
                  as to hint to his lovely Helen, that his future hopes centred in her smiling
                  approval of his confession and his attachment.</p>
               <p>At a convenient opportunity, the eldest daughter approached her fond but eccentric
                  parent with the design of explaining to him her position and desire, though she
                  had no clear idea how her propositions might be received by him.</p>
               <p>"Father," she said, modestly, "I know you love your daughter, for you have never,
                  once in life, crossed her wishes."</p>
               <p>"You are right, dear Helen. My fortune is your fortune, you know, my aim your
                  constant happiness. What will you ask?"</p>
               <p>"A boon, father, of joy or woe to me, as you may elect."</p>
               <p>"So serious, daughter! Then you have well considered your request, I am sure. Is
                  it so important as this?" continued the marquis, feelingly. "What has
                  happened?"</p>
               <p>"You shall know all the secret, anon, dear father."</p>
               <p>"Have you thought of marriage, daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Not at present, no;—but—"</p>
               <p>"I had hoped that you would favor the man I have already chosen for you, Helen,
                  among our friends, when you should think of this."</p>
               <p>"I have already made my own election, father, if you approve it."</p>
               <p>"What! My daughter Helen has not committed herself in this important step, without
                  consulting her parents in regard to it? Surely you have informed the marchioness
                  of this?"</p>
               <p>"I come to you first, my father, to you who have never yet denied me a favor or a
                  desire when expressed to you."</p>
               <p>"And you have accepted an—an offer, Helen?"</p>
               <p>"Only provisionally."</p>
               <p>"Is he a prince, my daughter?"</p>
               <p>"A <emph>what!</emph> No, father, no!"</p>
               <p>"A duke, or count?"</p>
               <p>"Neither."</p>
               <p>"The son of a noble, at least—"</p>
               <p>"He has no drop of gentle blood in his veins, father, but—"</p>
               <p>"Then he has <emph>fortune</emph>, surely. My daughter's dowry is a mine of
                  wealth; and he must tell down ready gold who wins her hand and purse."</p>
               <p>"He has no fortune, father, save what God has sent him in the shape of goodness,
                  worth and genius."</p>
               <p>"Poor, penniless! No name, no fame? Daughter, you wrong my confidence; and I
                  protest against your choice. Where does he dwell?"</p>
               <p>"In Venice, father."</p>
               <p>"So near us? Have I seen him? Is he one of the fawning well-dressed fools, that
                  force themselves, in hordes, about us here? We will return to France, forthwith,
                  my daughter."</p>
               <p>"Father!"</p>
               <p>"Nay, Helen do not urge this suit. Do not offend me with such a whim, when I would
                  make you noble, respected, noted, as you deserve to be, in the future."</p>
               <p>"One more word, dear father, and I have done. The time has been when even
                     <emph>you</emph>, I think, would not have spoken thus. The time has been when
                  you did not thus value title, or the world's opinion. I did not think you had thus
                  sadly changed. Your daughter is the same being now, as when the days were darker
                  on your path and on hers! Our Father in heaven has been gracious, and with the
                  same generous hand that has placed us in almost royal affluence, he has dispensed
                  to another, in profusive bulk, the choicest riches of the heart and mind, which he
                  will turn to laudable account. That man your Helen loves, with all her soul! Must
                  she reject him, father?"</p>
               <p>"The days of which you speak, happily, are long since past, my daughter. I would
                  have you wed the man that shall be worthy of yourself and of the brilliant fortune
                  that your father gives the bride. I love you, now, dear Helen," he continued,
                  kindly, "as fondly as when those same dark days came over us, and I will think of
                  this. Retire. I will confer with the marchioness, and you shall know our pleasure
                  on the morrow."</p>
               <p>Helen de Brandt was totally unprepared for any such demonstration of aristocratic
                  ideas, on the part of her father, as this interview had so suddenly indicated. She
                  had always been taught a different theory! Until the moment he had thus confessed
                  it—though he had not adhered to his present position very tenaciously—she had
                  always been led to believe that, of all things in earth, mere title was the most
                  inconsiderable of matters, in her father's esteem of men or women.</p>
               <p>The suspense that followed upon this meeting with her loved parent—whose slightest
                  wish it had ever been her highest joy to gratify—was almost intolerable. How would
                  he decide? What influence might not the marchioness bring to bear in favor of her
                  husband's views and purposes? What would poor Wilford do? And what must be the
                  consequence to her own heart, in the event of her father's adherence to his stated
                  opinion?</p>
               <p>A night of anguish passed, and morning only brought a continuation of distress to
                  Helen's mind. Was there no hope that the marquis would recant, or recede, from his
                  views?</p>
               <p>Wilford knew nothing of what was transpiring, and was on the point of calling at
                  the mansion of the marquis, when he unexpectedly received, through that
                  gentleman's steward, a summons to his residence.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOPES AND FEARS.</head>
               <p>WILFORD responded immediately to this invitation of the marquis, and upon reaching
                  the mansion, the artist was shown at once into the private room of de Brandt,
                  where he found him alone, and awaiting him, as it appeared.</p>
               <p>"Monsieur," said the marquis, "you are prompt in your coming. Promptness in
                  business affairs is a virtue, monsieur. Take a chair; I have business with
                  you."</p>
               <p>"What can I do to oblige you?" said Wilford, respectfully.</p>
               <p>"I am but a plain man, in matters like that which causes this interview, monsieur.
                  You can deeply oblige me, if you will."</p>
               <p>"I am most ready, I assure you," said Wilford, anxiously, "to do anything in my
                  humble way—anything in my power, to oblige the father of the beautiful Helen de
                  Brandt."</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> in your power, monsieur, to grant what I now
                     <emph>demand</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Believe me, then, it shall be done. What will the marquis ask?"</p>
               <p>"That you formally and instantly renounce all claim upon my daughter's hand."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Monsieur!</foreign>" exclaimed Wilford, excitedly and
                  surprised.</p>
               <p>"Here is pen, ink and paper. Write, monsieur!"</p>
               <p>"But, really—I am unprepared to—"</p>
               <p>"It matters nothing—I will dictate."</p>
               <p>"But, how have you—why have you—"</p>
               <p>"I insist, monsieur, upon this point. You have proposed to her, already."</p>
               <p>"You know this?"</p>
               <p>"I know all, monsieur! I know that you are penniless. I know that you have
                  insinuated yourself into her good graces, and you have drawn from her confessions
                  that do not comport with the dignity and position of the eldest daughter of the
                  Marquis de Brandt! From whom do you descend, monsieur? Have you a name? A fortune?
                  Fame? Anything to warrant you in making proposals of marriage to <emph>my</emph>
                  daughter? Speak, monsieur! Are you dumb, too?"</p>
               <p>Wilford was confounded with the vehement manner of the marquis, and he did not
                  venture a syllable in his defence, at present.</p>
               <p>"What have I done, monsieur?" continued the marquis, with apparent deep feeling,
                  "what have I done, that you should thus steal into the bosom of my family, to tear
                  from the embrace and care of affection and affluence, our fairest, best-loved and
                  tenderest child, to reduce to a questionable support, at best, to say nothing of
                  the chances of an adverse maintenance? You want money, monsieur! You need <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">l'argent!</foreign> Be it so—you shall have gold—since you have
                  had encouragement. I will pay for your disappointment pointment, but I demand
                  again that you forthwith renounce all claim to my daughter's hand! Yield, then—and
                  write!"</p>
               <p>"Not for my life, monsieur le marquis!"</p>
               <p>"What! See, Wilford—I am rich, powerful, I can make you what you dare not think of
                  becoming, if I withhold my favor. What is your price? I will pay it down, in
                  gold—but you must forget and renounce your plan."</p>
               <p>"Monsieur—"</p>
               <p>"Wilford! I will give you ten thousand crowns—"</p>
               <p>"Not a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sous</foreign>, monsieur le marquis."</p>
               <p>"Twenty thousand crowns!" Wilford was silent.</p>
               <p>"Fifty thousand, then—here! see my bills of credit, and name your price to
                  retire."</p>
               <p>"Monsieur, you rave," responded Wilford, as calmly as possible. "Pray listen to me
                  one moment, since I have heard you speak so long and so patiently."</p>
               <p>"Will you renounce my daughter's hand?"</p>
               <p>"No, monsieur le marquis! If all the crowns of all this world were yours to give,
                  if each of these would count within itself ten times the sum of all your splendid
                  fortune, I would not—on my soul! I would not accept it in exchange for one sweet
                  smile from your fair daughter!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>What</emph>, boy!"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>am</emph> penniless, monsieur le marquis. Fortune does not dispense its
                  favors equally, though I do not complain. I am the poor son of a poor but honest
                  father, who taught me to love virtue and to honor talent, while I spurned the
                  aristocracy which <foreign xml:lang="FRA">l'argent</foreign> alone created. I have
                  health, ambition, a share of genius in my way, a reputation free from stain of
                  guilt, the will to be <emph>a man</emph>, and fortune will not desert me,
                  monsieur, though <emph>you</emph> may flout at the poor painter."</p>
               <p>"And do you speak thus proudly here, to <emph>me</emph>, monsieur?"</p>
               <p>"I am beneath your roof, monsieur le marquis, and for the moment, am your guest. I
                  came at your bidding. I love your daughter with all the fervor of youth and with
                  an unconquerable, unchangeable passion. I cannot, <emph>will</emph> not formally
                  renounce her; I cannot be a villain, monsieur! Yet I will wait, wait your
                  pleasure, or a change in your disposition. She will appreciate this sacrifice on
                  my part, and I shall be certain of her approval of my course. Ask no more,
                  monsieur."</p>
               <p>"And you will press your suit no farther?"</p>
               <p>"Not without your free consent."</p>
               <p>"Enough, Wilford, you disarm me. I will see—I will meet you again. You may retire,
                  now, and see, young man! To-morrow—tomorrow, at ten o'clock, come hither
                  again."</p>
               <p>"I will not fail, monsieur," said Wilford, retiring.</p>
               <p>Immediately after he had withdrawn, the marquis summoned his daughter to his room.
                  Helen came, pale and wearied with excitement, but calm and pleasant as usual.</p>
               <p>"My daughter," said de Brandt, affectionately, "I have conferred with the
                  marchioness in reference to the matter I spoke to you of, yesterday. She will
                  approve the course I have resolved to take. Tell me, is young Wilford the man you
                  would render happy?"</p>
               <p>"I should have told you of this before, father, but for your severity, on
                  yesterday. I had no wish to bring down trouble on <emph>his</emph> head, and since
                  you were so ambitious for my weal, I did not name the man I had
                     <emph>presumed</emph>, perhaps, to love."</p>
               <p>"Is it not young Wilford, daughter?"</p>
               <p>"You have named him rightly, father."</p>
               <p>"Wilford," continued the marquis, slowly; "Wilford is an honorable young man. I do
                  not find the name in our calendar, but this person is a gentleman of merit. You
                  have seen Wilford before this, have you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, long since."</p>
               <p>"You are content with him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, father; with all my heart."</p>
               <p>"And you are satisfied with his fortune?"</p>
               <p>"He is rich in all that goes to make the man and gentleman, dear father; and you
                  should know him, surely."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> know Wilford; but you did not mention him."</p>
               <p>"You did not afford me the opportunity to speak his name."</p>
               <p>"And this is he of whom we have so long had hints?"</p>
               <p>"The same, father."</p>
               <p>"'Tis well, then, Helen. We accept your choice, but, mark me, for the present do
                  not speak of us, in the matter; I have a plan of my own to carry out, as you may
                  now suspect, and I desire that it may not be frustrated. Preserve your deportment
                  towards him as if nothing had occurred out of the ordinary course of events. I
                  wished to try how strongly you were attached to him, and I have also measured him,
                  since I spoke with you."</p>
               <p>"Who, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child. Think you, I would risk my<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5956-00000032"
                  /> Helen's happiness, without some farther test, in hands unused to guide and
                  cherish innocence and virtue such as she possesses? Think you, after having held
                  the helm so long. I would venture placing it in hands unskilled or reckless, when
                  the rocks and shoals might be in sight?"</p>
               <p>"Father! You have been all in all to me! Do as you will, I will still love you
                  more than ever!"</p>
               <p>On the following day, at the appointed hour, Wilford made his appearance again at
                  the residence of the marquis. The entire manner of de Brandt was changed towards
                  his guest. He was cheerful and polite, and the artist at once augured a good
                  result to his hopes.</p>
               <p>"Wilford," said the marquis, pleasantly, "I have heard a good account of you,
                  since last we met. Did you ever hear of one Noell, in England, a mariner, I think
                  he was, in the employ of the British government?"</p>
               <p>"I knew one Harry Noell, whom I met at Beachy Head, the keeper of the light-house,
                  there."</p>
               <p>"He had a daughter, did he not?"</p>
               <p>"You are right, monsieur. A sweeter girl than Nelly Noell never breathed the ocean
                  air. And brave she was, as well. They saved my life, monsieur, and I
                     <emph>should</emph> know them, surely!" said Wilford, gratefully.</p>
               <p>"You have a portrait of the daughter, in your possession!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, monsieur; and it is so like your own Helen, that I have more than once been
                  tempted to present it to the marchioness, had I supposed she would have accepted
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I have heard your history of the picture, from the lips of a visitor to your
                  studio, some months since; what became of this Noell and his child?"</p>
               <p>"They perished in the ruins of their humble dwelling, at Beachy Point, which was
                  fired by the hand of malice."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes. I recollect. Wilford, do you still adhere to the position you assumed
                  when I saw you, yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"Monsieur le marquis, I can only throw myself upon your lenity. I know, full well,
                  that the charms and the prospective fortune of your daughter are sufficient to
                  command the love and aspirations of many who are high in station, and heavy in
                  purse. Against these, I can only present a whole heart, a clear head, and an
                  honesty of purpose."</p>
               <p>"Which we <emph>accept,</emph> monsieur!" said the marquis, without further
                  detention.</p>
               <p>The heart of Wilford was too full for reply, and de Brandt cut short the interview
                  with a request that he would forget his harshness, and call at his residence
                  often.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">FAMILIAR FACES.</head>
               <p>WE must now turn and fellow the fortunes of the light-keeper and his daughter,
                  from the time we left them, soon after their arrival in Europe. As we have already
                  seen, Noell had removed the name of the yacht from the stern, and he had
                  subsequently taken all the necessary precautions to destroy any other evidence of
                  the place whence she hailed, or who she might belong to. As soon as he made the
                  port where he designed to take her, he found a ready purchaser for her among some
                  smugglers, there, who paid him the full value for the Waif. He then went down to
                  Lisbon, thence to Madrid, and there we left him, with his gold and silver turned
                  into cash and bills of credit to a much larger amount than had ever before been
                  seen. Assuming disguises for himself and child, for the time being, he travelled
                  incognita for a long period, without determining what he should eventually do, or
                  where he should settle.</p>
               <p>From time to time, as he watched the journals of the day, he noticed the various
                  accounts given of his supposed death, at the time of the burning of the
                  light-house, and he found this forced hypothesis in regard to the fate of himself
                  and his daughter a very convenient circumstance to favor his future intentions. So
                  he said nothing except to enjoin positive and unconditional secrecy upon his
                  daughter, who had never known any other authority, and who did precisely as she
                  was bidden by her father, without regard to reasons or consequences.</p>
               <p>"The captain and his friend must have escaped, and they <emph>must</emph> have
                  been the parties who applied the torch to the light-house," said Noell, reading
                  the account of the fire to his daughter. "When we left the premises there was no
                  fire in the building, except in the lamps at the cone, and as that portion of the
                  light was wholly composed of glass and iron, it is not probable that it proceeded
                  from that cause in any way. They probably committed this outrage from malice,
                  since they had lost their booty, and we may meet the rascals, again, one day or
                  another."</p>
               <p>"I hope we may never see them, again, father," said Nelly.</p>
               <p>"Well, it may be so. Now, Nelly, I have told you what I have done, and how we are
                  circumstanced. We will make the best of it, and I desire to impress on your mind
                  the importance, for the present, of our maintaining a strict disguise, and until
                  the whole affair shall have been forgotten, lest unpleasant queries arise that
                  might greatly jeopardise or embarrass me. I assume the responsibility of this act,
                  alone, and you will continue to be guided and protected by me. Ask no unnecessary
                  questions, be prudent constantly, and all will come out right, at last."</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5956-00000033"/>
               <p>With this reasoning and this sort of parental appeal, Noell effectually quieted
                  all apprehensions and doubts in Nelly's mind, and they proceeded to enjoy the
                  means they had so suddenly become possessed of, in a rational but liberal
                  manner.</p>
               <p>Fixing upon a permanent incognito, at last, Noell retired to the south of France
                  and established himself, with his daughter, in retired but handsome quarters,
                  where they <emph>began life,</emph> once more, upon a scale of ease and splendor
                  that was nowhere rivalled in the vicinity.</p>
               <p>There dwelt in the immediate neighborhood, a lady of some substantial pretensions
                  to beauty, who was well-known as a most estimable person, in all her relations,
                  who was reported to be very wealthy, and whose style of living evinced that she
                  had a goodly share of the world's goods in her own right. This proved to be
                  correct. She was the widow of a millionaire, who had been dead some three or four
                  years. Noell met her, and was struck with her ladylike bearing and her apparent
                  good qualities, and he suddenly conceived the idea, as he had been a widower many
                  years, and as he was now in a pecuniary condition to set up such a domestic
                  establishment as <unclear>he</unclear> might fancy, that he would take to himself
                  a new wife—provided the lady mentioned should be agreeable to such an
                  arrangement.</p>
               <p>Madame did not object to Noell, but, like a business-woman as she was, she made
                  such inquiries into his character as she could, without offence, and became
                  satisfied that he did not seek her fortune, alone. His means were found to be
                  ample, and she at length consented to change her name and condition. She married
                  Noell, and the match proved a fortunate and happy union, in all respects. Their
                  dispositions were not unlike each other's, they were both largely independent in
                  fortune, and the united wealth of the two was an enormous sum, the whole income of
                  which it was impossible for them, reasonably, to expend.</p>
               <p>A magnificent chateau was purchased in the interior, and to this place the family
                  retired to enjoy their splendid income. As Nelly became better acquainted with the
                  usages of society, in the acquirement of the details of which she proved an apt
                  scholar, she was permitted by her father to enjoy herself in her own way, and as
                  best suited her own tastes. Such means were placed at her disposal as she required
                  for a fashionable "privy purse," and she dealt out her means with a liberal
                  hand.</p>
               <p>She was especially fond of pictures; and at her father's house she maintained a
                  beautiful gallery of the works of the best ancient and modern artists, which she
                  collected together, from time to time, as the opportunity presented. She often
                  left home, attended by two or three servants, and visited Marseilles, Lyons, or
                  even Paris, when in the mood, in search of gems of art in painting or
                  sculpture.</p>
               <p>While at the latter city, on one occasion, she heard the name of Wilford mentioned
                  as an artist from. England, and one of great merit. Notwithstanding her father's
                  positive and repeated caution and injunctions as to her conduct when away from his
                  supervision, and although, at that time, it was all-important to Noell to preserve
                  yet, for a while, his incognita, the impetuous daughter resolved upon visiting the
                  studio of Wilford, and to ascertain for herself whether his fame outran his
                  abilities.</p>
               <p>Completely and thoroughly disguised, she called there and examined his efforts.
                  Immediately after this, Wilford became acquainted with <emph>Marie</emph>—whose
                  tender epistles and whose generous sentiments had so deeply interested him, it
                  will be remembered. Then, as the "lady in black" she appeared to him again, at his
                  rooms, and with her own ears listened to his praises of, and his regrets for, the
                     <emph>deceased</emph> and lovely Nelly Noell! She saw her own portrait there,
                  like a mirror before her, and which she would have purchased, at any price, but
                  the artist would not part with it. Ah, how this flattered the veiled but lovely
                  daughter of his benefactor. And time passed on.</p>
               <p>While Wilford sincerely thought that the ashes of the departed Nelly reposed
                  beneath the scarred and fallen ruins of the light-house, this same Nell was
                  flitting to and fro between her home and his studio—watching over him, directly
                  and indirectly, in acquiring fame and fortune. To her slight of hand was he
                  indebted for the mysterious note found in his sketch-book; the first he received
                  from the subsequently known <emph>Marie</emph>. He never suspected
                     <emph>her,</emph> however. To her influence he owed much of the success which
                  attended his labors, too—for she lost no opportunity of sending friends to him,
                  when he most needed their patronage. Nevertheless, her plans were so adroitly
                  managed that he was entirely ignorant of her existence, or her agency in the
                  matter, and he lived on, ah, how unconscious of her secret devotion to him!</p>
               <p>But, while he was in the midst of his labors in Paris, there arrived in the
                  metropolis a meteor of rare brilliancy in the world of fashion. The praises of the
                  new-comers were loud upon every lip, the fame of their extraordinary wealth and
                  sumptuous mode of living spread in all directions, and Wilford found himself among
                  the guests invited to partake of their splendid hospitality.</p>
               <p>The still humble but aspiring artist had little taste for this sort of
                  entertainment, for it was not only by far too expensive a medium of enjoyment for
                  his purse, but he felt that the sphere for the present, was above him; and he
                  would have avoided mixing in such company, but for the unexpected and timely
                  arrival of his friend Manfred from England.</p>
               <p>He responded to the invitation he had received, however, when he learned that his
                  companion was to be present, and here he met with the only woman whom he had ever
                  seriously thought of loving. In Helen de Brandt—the daughter of the now famous
                  marquis, he saw a being such as he had pictured that Nelly who was lost to him;
                  and he was vanquished, at sight of her singular resemblance to his ideal
                  darling.</p>
               <p>We have already learned how he followed up this attraction, and how he was
                  received by the daughter of the illustrious marquis; and this brings us again to
                  the continuation of our story, and the development of our plot.</p>

               <head type="sub">APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURES.</head>
               <p>THE de Brandts had returned to their estate on the Gironde. During their residence
                  here, for a twelvemonth or more, they had been known by the title they had chosen
                  when they came from the south—but, as the reader has already seen, this name was
                  of course fictitious. It will have also been discovered that the widowed
                  "marquis," who had been so fortunate as to fall into a gold mine so suddenly, and
                  who subsequently became united in marriage to the charming and wealthy Widow
                  Dessaret, was only a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">marquis</foreign> for the time being,
                  for his own purposes; and that he was in fact none other than our long-missing and
                  worthy acquaintance, <emph>Harry Noell</emph>, the whilom light-keeper.</p>
               <p>Hortense was the daughter of Madame Dessaret, and Helen was our identical "Nelly,"
                  a pest cognomen corrupted by family usage for her real name. All this, as yet, was
                  entirely unknown, however, except to the parties directly spoken of; neither
                  Manfred nor Wilford entertained the slightest suspicion of the fact, and such had
                  been the management of the so-called de Brandts (which was the family name of
                  Madame Dessaret, prior to her fires marriage), that the deception had proved
                  entirely successful, from the beginning through every circumstance connected with
                  them.</p>
               <p>From the very outset of her new career, indeed, from the hour when Wilford finally
                  parted with Noell and his daughter, at the light, the father of Nelly had
                  resolved—if they lived long enough—to bring about a union between the artist and
                  his child. He learned the disposition of Nelly towards Wilford, and he felt, as
                  soon as he became possessed of sufficient means to carry out his intentions at his
                  leisure, that there would be no difficulty in consummating the happiness of two
                  hearts that he was certain would affiliate, if the proper direction were given to
                  his design.</p>
               <p>All the circumstances that subsequently occurred, favored his plan. He knew that
                  the public believed him dead. He took care to ascertain that the artist had
                  adopted this belief, and his management aided to confirm this supposition, in his
                  mind. He saw that it was then only necessary to adopt a plausible incognita, and
                  to preserve it, a while, to enable him to carry his scheme to a successful
                  termination.</p>
               <p>He suffered his naturally heavy beard and profuse hair to go unshorn. He adopted
                  an entirely tirely different style of dress, and habit of speech. His manner
                  became thoroughly changed, from the affable and easy ways of a seemingly careless
                  and inferior being, to the austere and stiff address of a harsh and authoritative
                  military man, apparently. In his newly-adopted costume, he appeared much taller in
                  stature, than usual; and his generous style of living had the effect of rendering
                  him corpulent, and much stouter in person than before. His whole mien was changed,
                  and the fact that Noell had been dead several months (in Wilford's opinion and
                  belief), had the effect of warding off all suspicion as to his identity with any
                  one he had ever known before.</p>
               <p>In addition to all this, it will be recollected that during the time that Wilford
                  was domiciled at the light-keeper's dwelling, he had been, up to the last very few
                  days, entirely unconscious of anything in life. When he came to consciousness,
                  finally, he found himself in a small, darkened room, attended by a gentle girl,
                  and subsequently saw the form of a man about his bedside.</p>
               <p>Wilford had never had the opportunity to examine Noell's lineaments, particularly,
                  and really never knew his face and features very accurately, for, as soon as he
                  was able to look at the daylight, Manfred took him away to better quarters. Thus
                  it was not strange he should have been completely deceived as to the identity of
                  the wealthy and stately Marquis de Brandt, surrounded by his new wife and family
                  and retinue, with the person of the poor widowed light-keeper of Beachy Head,
                  whom, above all, he supposed in his heart had gone to his long and final home.</p>
               <p>So with Helen. The moment Wilford fixed his eyes upon the eldest daughter of the
                  nominal "marquis," at his levee in Paris, it will be remembered that her
                  resemblance to Nelly struck him so remarkably as to draw from him the exclamation
                  "it is her very self!" Yet, when he saw her more fully developed form, her
                  difference of manner, her dark brown ringlets, and observed her polished manners,
                  in addition to the fact that she spoke to him in a foreign tongue, with an
                  apparent natural accent, the first impressions vanished, and he never in reality
                  dreamed that she and Nelly Noell could be the same individual. Besides this, the
                  circumstances that surrounded her, would alone have destroyed or annulled this
                  belief. She was but one of two or three of the children of the marquis, who was a
                  married man of immense wealth. Noell was a poor lone widower, with but a single
                  child—as Wilford knew him—and all these things served much to aid in completing
                  the deceit.</p>
               <p>As we have said, the family of de Brandt had returned to their princely residence
                  at <foreign xml:lang="FRA">la Realle</foreign>, where, very soon after their
                  arrival from Italy, they commenced making arrangements for quitting that portion
                  of the world, having decided, thenceforward, to re-assume their proper name, and
                  to pass the remainder of their life in England. The family mansion and its
                  appointments were readily disposed of. The tenantry was continued, and as Noell's
                  funds were largely invested in stocks and government securities, there was little
                  delay in his breaking up, and in his final removal from the chateau where he had
                  so pleasantly resided.</p>
               <p>Among other preparations, the former light-keeper, now no longer the "marquis,"
                  had previously ordered the building of a beautiful yacht, which was furnished
                  after the exact model of the Waif, and which was in readiness for launching when
                  he quit la Realle. He had preserved drawings and the dimensions of his first
                  vessel from keel to truck, and the model was the same; indeed, when he called to
                  examine her, at last, before taking possession of her, he could not point out a
                  single particle of change that he would have made, either in her hull, her rig,
                  her color, or her finishings, so perfectly had his memory and his drawings served
                  him, and so faithfully had her builder finished and equipped her. She was
                  christened the <name>Waif</name>, without hesitation, and Nelly, when she came to
                  see her, declared that she could not find a fault with the imitation, in any
                  particular.</p>
               <p>Wilford had reached Paris again, after his brief absence at Venice and the south,
                  where orders were awaiting him, in abundance. Manfred had gone to England, once
                  more, and it was clear, from his deportment, that he was perfectly well satisfied
                  with the result of <emph>his</emph> trip on the Continent. He had been formally
                  accepted by Hortense, and he would be united to her in marriage as soon as the
                  requisite preliminaries could be arranged, at home. His father interposed no
                  objection to the union of his son with the daughter of a live <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">marquis</foreign>, and preparations<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000035"/> were forthwith put in train to consummate this
                  event.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, neither Manfred nor Wilford knew anything about the real name and
                  character of the "de Brandts," except what they had seen, and what they had been
                  permitted to learn in regard to them, abroad. The fruit was not yet ripe enough to
                  pluck, in the opinion of Noell, and he was not quite ready for the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> of his long-planned and thus far
                  shrewdly-wrought scheme.</p>
               <p>But the hour was approaching when the curtain must be withdrawn, and when the
                  parties must see and know each other, precisely as they were in reality. Wilford
                  kept himself busily employed at his easel, however; for his patrons had increased,
                  and he now had several pictures under way, that had been bespoken for many
                  months.</p>
               <p>He had not heard a word from "Marie" since his interview with her at the hotel in
                  Venice, when she so frankly avowed herself to him, and offered him her hand and
                  fortune. He did not much expect to hear anything further from that source, under
                  the circumstances, and he set the affair down as a Parisian adventure that he
                  should not forget, but to which he attached no particular importance. But Marie
                  had not yet done with Alfred Wilford! She was a fearless intrepid woman, who, once
                  resolved upon any measure, heeded no impediments, suffered no adverse circumstance
                  to deter her from carrying her final purpose to issue. So had she planned in this
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">affaire de cœur</foreign>, and she followed up her
                  enterprise with a determination and spirit worthy of all praise.</p>
               <p>Wilford was engaged as usual in his studio, and had almost forgotten how
                  beautifully the "beggar" had appeared to him, when he was suddenly aroused from
                  his labors by the sound of a voice he could not mistake.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Bon jour, monsieur!</foreign>" said the "lady in black,"
                  entering his room quietly, and approaching the easel where he was engaged.</p>
               <p>Wilford turned quickly about, and beheld the veiled figure of his generous patron,
                  the purchaser of his Madonna. He did not feel at ease, and was sorry she had
                  called. But he was compelled to be civil to his strange and eccentric customer,
                  who had taken so deep an interest in his welfare.</p>
               <p>"Madame," he said, "I feared, after our last interview, that you would scarcely
                  honor me with another call."</p>
               <p>"Am I not welcome, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Madame! How can you be otherwise? You who have done me such solid service, and
                  who have evinced so lively an interest in my affairs?"</p>
               <p>"Then you do not say you did not desire to meet me, again?"</p>
               <p>"I did not say so, madame, surely. But, to what—what particular circumstance am I
                  now indebted for your present visit, if I may venture to ask?"</p>
               <p>"My business will be briefly told. I have learned that you have been successful in
                  your suit, Wilford. I hear that you have been accepted—your proposal to Helen de
                  Brandt has been approved, I mean. Is the report correct?"</p>
               <p>"In all candor, lady, I really think you should hardly press me for an answer to
                  so delicate a question," said Wilford, cautiously.</p>
               <p>"Still, if I urge it, will you not answer <emph>yes</emph> or
                  <emph>no</emph>?"</p>
               <p>"Will you give me your reasons for this query?"</p>
               <p>"Curiosity, if you please—or any other cause."</p>
               <p>"That would be insufficient. Yet I will not deny your appeal. I have reason to
                  hope and believe that my suit is, happily, progressing favorably."</p>
               <p>"So I feared. Wilford, it is not too late. I have already so far forgotten the
                  dignity and character of my sex as to open my heart to you, and propose a hand
                  untainted, with a splendid fortune, for your acceptance. In your own country this
                  would have seemed monstrous—but in France, it is not so peculiar or unnatural. You
                  have declined the proposal, made in all confidence and honor, and you have shown
                  me that you do not appreciate the offer."</p>
               <p>"Madame, I am a thousand times grateful to you, for substantial evidence of your
                  disposition towards me; but I have no heart to give you in exchange, and you
                  surely could not seek a hand without a heart?" continued Wilford, seriously.</p>
               <p>"No, Wilford, no! You are right, and I have erred. Could it have been possible for
                  me to have served you farther than it has already been my pleasure to do, I would
                  gladly have done so. If I can now aid you, in any way, command me without
                  hesitation."</p>
               <p>"Madame, the kindness of yourself and other friends has placed me entirely above
                  and beyond any necessity for further pecuniary aid. My pictures have commanded
                  such prices that I have been able to live agreeably with my wishes, and I have
                  already realized a sum that will place me beyond the reach of want, under any
                  ordinary circumstances. I thank you for your kindness, and trust that you will
                  continue to be my friend."</p>
               <p>"Be happy, then. You do not know me, you have not seen my face, when I have
                  communicated with you, and you lose nothing in fancy by your determination to
                  reject me. Adieu I monsieur. May you be happier with your chosen Helen, than you
                     <emph>could</emph> have been with Marie."</p>
               <p>The speaker left, without another word; and Wilford felt greatly relieved as he
                  heard the door close behind her!</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DUPLICATE YACHT.</head>
               <p>WHEN the Waif was finally ready for sea, she was sent up the coast, in charge of a
                  skilful skipper employed by Noell, and arrived in safety off the mouth of the
                  Seine. A more beautiful little craft had never been seen in French waters. She was
                  jauntily dressed and her furniture and fittings were very elegant and substantial.
                  Upon her stern in a gilded scroll appeared her name, like the original, and she
                  was in all respects similar in size, tonnage, color and appearance.</p>
               <p>Manfred had been over to England some weeks, but only temporarily; and was now
                  returning to Paris, where he had engaged to meet the "marquis" and his family, who
                  had recently arrived there. The friends were in high glee, at the prospect before
                  them, for they felt satisfied that everything was now pretty well settled as
                  regarded their future hopes with the de Brandts. As yet, they were entirely
                  ignorant of what was in store for them, however!</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Manfred," said his friend, as soon as the latter called
                  upon him. "How have you been, and how does your father's family?"</p>
               <p>"Well, all well, Wilford. Do you know, miboy, that I made a discovery, half an
                  hour since?"</p>
               <p>"No. What now?"</p>
               <p>"You remember the pretty little yacht I presented to your friend Noell, at Beachy
                  Head?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure, and a beauty she was, too."</p>
               <p>"What became of her?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, except that report gave out, at the time the premises of Noell were
                  burned that she had been spirited away by some one and it was supposed that the
                  two swindlers who did the mischief there, were the purloiners, after they had
                  applied the match. That is all I ever heard about her. Why?"</p>
               <p>"She lies in the stream, off the river's mouth."</p>
               <p>"What!"</p>
               <p>"It is true. I have seen her, to-day."</p>
               <p>"You mean that you have seen something that resembles her, I presume," said
                  Wilford.</p>
               <p>"I mean just what I say, miboy!" insisted Manfred. "I saw the Waif, my yacht that
                     <emph>was,</emph> which I fitted up and sent down to Noell at the beach, two
                  years ago, and more."</p>
               <p>"Well, what did you do?"</p>
               <p>"Do? About what?"</p>
               <p>"Why, what course did you take, when you discovered her?"</p>
               <p>"Due east, miboy, as near as I can calculate the run from the quay to your studio!
                  At any rate, I came straight here, and I think the <name>Waif</name> now lies off
                  here, a mile or so to the westward."</p>
               <p>"A truce to your nautical stuff, Manfred, and tell me if you did not institute
                  proceedings, in some way, to seize her?"</p>
               <p>"To seize her! What kind of a piratical disposition position do you imagine I
                  possess? What should I seize her for?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>For,</emph> man! Why—if the two men ran away with her, that is, I mean, if
                  they carried her off, or sailed her off, or whatever you term it, wouldn't it be
                  easy to catch the scoundrels, and bring them to punishment for their
                  misdeeds?"</p>
               <p>"Why, miboy, do you suppose for one moment that if those men took possession of
                  her and put away from the beach in her, with the design of profiting by the
                  movement, they would have kept her long? Do you imagine they would dare to make
                  their appearance <emph>here,</emph> in such close contiguity to the scene of their
                  robbery, in the vessel they had stolen? Of course not. They probably sold the
                     <name>Waif</name> at the first opportunity; and the present owner thus comes
                  honestly enough possessed of her. At any rate I do not feel disposed to question
                  his right to her."</p>
               <p>"Yes. But who <emph>is</emph> the owner? There could be no harm in asking the
                  question."</p>
               <p>"That is quite another thing, miboy. I did ask who owned her, and received for
                  answer that it was not known <emph>who</emph> he was, only that he was a gentleman
                  of fashion and fortune who had lately arrived at Paris, with his family."</p>
               <p>"And you are certain it is the <name>Waif?</name>"</p>
               <p>"As sure as I am that you are Wilford, or that you ever saw the 'lady in sables,'
                  miboy," said Manfred, jocosely.</p>
               <p>"That reminds me, Manfred, of another meeting I have lately had with this
                  incomprehensible being."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"Here, in Paris."</p>
               <p>"Possible! She follows you, then, like a brother!"</p>
               <p>"I had tried to forget her, and hoped she would not annoy me. And yet," he
                  continued, "she is exceedingly kind in speech, and appears to be very submissive
                  and resigned to her disappointment."</p>
               <p>"Is she pretty?"</p>
               <p>"There you are ahead of me, again. I have never seen her face."</p>
               <p>"Never—and have had half a dozen interviews with her?"</p>
               <p>"No. She has always been deeply veiled, except at Venice, and then she had an
                  entire domino, covering her face, completely."</p>
               <p>"This <emph>is</emph> romance, to be sure. What did she want, this time? I thought
                  she would not see you again?"</p>
               <p>"She sought nothing new, I think. She was pleasant and talkative, as usual, and
                  retired. But she is a singular being."</p>
               <p>"Yes; and you will do well to be ridded of her. Had <emph>I</emph> been in your
                  situation, I would have seen her face, at any rate."</p>
               <p>"How would you have done this?"</p>
               <p>"Insisted upon her gratifying me, after so long a questionable acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"And if she still refused?"</p>
               <p>"I would have removed her domino, by force, if necessary."</p>
               <p>"That would have been rude, Manfred."</p>
               <p>"I would have seen her face, I tell you, miboy."</p>
               <p>"And so will <emph>I,</emph>" said Wilford, valiantly, "if ever I meet with her,
                  alone, again!"</p>
               <p>And he kept his word, too!</p>
               <p>"But, Manfred," he continued, "I want to have a look at the yacht. Come, let us
                  take a cab and go down." And the friends were soon at the Quai d'Orleans, below
                  which lay the Waif in the stream.</p>
               <p>"How does she look, miboy?"</p>
               <p>"As natural as life, Manfred, upon my word," exclaimed Wilford. "Ah, my little
                  lady," he continued, addressing himself to the boat, "you and I <emph>ought</emph>
                  to be acquainted, to be sure. We've been <emph>fast</emph> friends, together, if I
                  remember right!"</p>
               <p>"So closely related on one occasion, at least," said Manfred, good-humoredly,
                  "that you couldn't throw her off quite so readily as you manage to get rid of your
                  other friend, the 'lady in black,' eh?"</p>
               <p>"Manfred," said Wilford, resolutely, "I am determined to know who owns this yacht,
                  now."</p>
               <p>"Proceed, miboy—proceed. And if you ascertain, just make a note on't, for my
                  benefit."</p>
               <p>"Who's that?" said Wilford, pointing to a coarsely-dressed man, who was just
                  leaving the quay in a small boat.</p>
               <p>"Gad, Wilford, I can't say, never having seen the gentleman before, to my
                  knowledge."</p>
               <p>"Well. Do you perceive anything the matter with my eyes?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, except that from your expression, I should say you had discovered a very
                  large-sized mare's-nest, on a sudden."</p>
               <p>"Well, if that isn't Harry Noell yonder, I never saw him!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Who?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Noell, the light-keeper."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! Come, miboy, we had better return. You are getting excited. Every pretty
                  woman you meet is a Nelly, and every man you see in a blouse is Harry Noell! Look
                     sharp,<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5956-00000037"/> that you don't play at this
                  sort of hide-and-seek in Helen's presence. Come!"</p>
               <p>"No. I will satisfy myself who that man is at all events."</p>
               <p>The man in the gray blouse was taken straight to the yacht. The foresail was
                  immediately flung out, and the Waif proceeded away down the river.</p>
               <p>Wilford was ready to swear, almost, that he had seen Harry Noell, that day. But
                  his friend laughed the idea out of him, and they returned from the quay as wise as
                  they came.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the jests of Manfred, it was Harry Noell they had thus met with.
                  He saw the young men examining the yacht, and calling to a waterman jumped into
                  his boat and was put aboard the Waif. He immediately ordered the skipper to fall
                  down the river a mile or two, for the purpose of getting away from further present
                  observation. He returned to his lodgings at evening, enjoying the sensation he
                  thought he had caused, in the highest degree. This, too, was a part of his as yet
                  unfinished scheme, to be completed, anon.</p>
               <p>On the succeeding evening, just as Wilford had prepared to visit the "marquis" and
                  his family, his servant brought him the following note, which he said had been
                  left at the door a moment previously.</p>
               <p>"A friend of Mr. Wilford's, who has just arrived in town, would be glad to have
                  him call immediately at his hotel, the <name>Leon de'Or,</name> on especial
                  business. His friend will leave Paris shortly, and will detain him but a few
                  minutes.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Nine, P. M. Room 56."</p>
               <p>As it was still quite early—for Paris hours—Wilford pocketed the note, and ordered
                  his carriage at once to the <name>Hotel du Leon d'Or</name>.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TRIPLE APPARITION.</head>
               <p>IN a retired but beautifully furnished apartment of the hotel mentioned, there sat
                  a lady whose age was uncertain because her face could not be seen. She had
                  recently arrived in Paris, and was but little acquainted there, it was
                  thought.</p>
               <p>The room she now occupied was contiguous to a similar apartment that opened into
                  this, and both were similarly appointed. The connecting door stood open, and the
                  light could be seen from either. She half reclined upon a small sofa or divan
                  which stood aside near this door, and her form indicated her to be a lady not over
                  five-and-twenty—perhaps younger. She wore a masque that completely hid her
                  features from view, and she seemed to be anxiously awaiting some one' arrival—when
                  the outer door opened and <unclear>the attendant</unclear> announced:</p>
               <p>"Monsieur Wilford."</p>
               <p>"Show him in, Louis," said the lady, at once.</p>
               <p>And our young artist stepped into the room.</p>
               <p>He had rather suspected this—at the last moment before he reached the hotel, but
                  it was too late for him to recede with decency. As he anticipated, he discovered
                  in the person who now had "special business" with him, the masked figure of the
                  "lady in sables."</p>
               <p>"You came reluctantly, Wilford," she said, in a sort of melancholy tone, "I see
                  you are not pleased. I regret this, for the present meeting will be our last one,
                  I presume."</p>
               <p>"That will be entirely as you elect, madame," replied Wilford. "I did
                     <emph>not</emph> think it was your summons that called me here, to-night, when
                  I received your note; but I am here, and will take your commands with pleasure,
                  since we are now mutually aware of the relations we bear to each other.</p>
               <p>"You have resolved, Alfred Wilford, to wed the daughter of a man whom you suppose
                  to be noble," continued the lady, with emphasis.</p>
               <p>"I am affianced to the Lady Helen de Brandt, madam," responded Wilford,
                  proudly.</p>
               <p>"I know it, monsieur. She is the daughter of the Marquis de Brandt."</p>
               <p>"You are right."</p>
               <p>"You are sure she is the daughter of a marquis, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes, madame."</p>
               <p>"Then you are very easily cajoled, my young friend."</p>
               <p>"Cajoled!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is the word I used."</p>
               <p>"And how, pray?"</p>
               <p>"The father of Helen is no marquis at all, Wilford. His name is an assumed
                  one—that is all," continued the masque, coolly.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5956-00000038"/>
               <p>"This is monstrous, madame! What can be your object, in thus attempting to
                  tantalize me, I cannot tell. But—"</p>
               <p>"—'sh—Alfred Wilford! Listen to what I have to say, <emph>for your own
                     good,</emph>" added the "lady in sables."</p>
               <p>"Not a marquis!" muttered the painter.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> are noble, Wilford. Noble in heart, noble in person, noble in
                  purpose, noble in genius and talent and worth—a natural nobleman, fashioned by his
                  hand who alone can create nobility. I am no prophetess, no seer, Wilford! I repeat
                  it, the father of Helen is not a marquis, or the descendant of a marquis."</p>
               <p>"Do you know this,—or do you only sus—"</p>
               <p>"I suspect nothing, monsieur. On my honor, as a lady and a Christian, as your
                  friend and well-wisher, I assure you I <emph>know</emph> of what I speak"</p>
               <p>"He is wealthy—honorable—is he not?"</p>
               <p>"He is. But you have been deceived, I say. Will you tamely submit to this?"</p>
               <p>"I really, really am greatly obliged."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! It is too late for compliments, Wilford. Let us talk like reasonable
                  beings, who appreciate each other. Tell me, Wilford," she continued, "had the poor
                  beggar-girl of the Pont des Fleurs possessed all the-charms of this beauteous
                  Helen (as you deem her), could you have stooped to her condition, and taken her to
                  your arms, though she loved you as few women ever learn to love? If Marie, whose
                  face you could not see, were even quite as pleasant to look upon; if Marie had
                  devoted her life to you, and would have died to serve you, could you have smiled
                  upon her graciously in return? If the poor light-keeper's child, who watched at
                  your fevered bedside, and wiped away the sweat drops as they oozed from your
                  aching brow; if poor Noell's darling daughter still existed, and should own
                     <emph>her</emph> love for you; still would you turn to the child of this false
                  marquis, and claim his Helen as your bride?"</p>
               <p>"You speak at random, lady. Noell has gone to his last home—"</p>
               <p>"And if he lived?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! <emph>If</emph> he lived, and <emph>if</emph> his Nelly lived, I should not
                  now be here, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"But if she lived, if Nelly still were living, you would not discard the daughter
                  of the marquis, surely, Wilford?" said the lady, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"O, this is useless rant, madame. I cannot say what I might do if miracles can be
                  performed in Paris."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Wilford, there are stranger things in heaven and earth than may be dreamed in
                  your philosophy! <emph>Noell still lives, monsieur!</emph>"</p>
               <p>At the utterance of these last words, which the lady delivered in a measured and
                  prophetic tone, young Wilford sprang to his feet, and nearly fainted from the
                  shock they occasioned him.</p>
               <p>"Not dead! You are certain of this, too?"</p>
               <p>"As sure as I am that I now speak to the living Wilford."</p>
               <p>"And—Nel—Nelly!" almost screamed the youth, in his terrible excitement, "Nelly
                  isn't dead, either?"</p>
               <p>"Noell's daughter lives, monsieur!" said the woman, promptly.</p>
               <p>Alfred Wilford gasped, and fell heavily to the floor.</p>
               <p>"Quick!" cried the affrighted masque, to her attendant at the door; "some water,
                  wine—quick, Louis!"</p>
               <p>The servant instantly brought restoratives, raised the artist up, and saw the
                  indications of returning consciousness as his mistress re-entered the apartment,
                  and waived him to retire. When Wilford came to himself again, the lady in sables
                  was gone; and in her place at his side, with soothing and gentle words, there
                  stood the poor beggar-girl of the Pont des Fleurs.</p>
               <p>"I hope that monsieur is better," she said, in a sweet and gentle accent. "Marie
                  is always near you, Wilford, when you are in trouble."</p>
               <p>The painter looked up, passed his hand over his eyes, and saw before him the
                  figure of the poor girl whom he had befriended on the bridge, at midnight. Then
                  recovering his speech, he cried out:</p>
               <p>"Whence do <emph>you</emph> come?"</p>
               <p>"Marie is near you," she said. "Do not be alarmed."</p>
               <p>He gazed at her a moment, as if recovering from some dreadful dream; there was the
                  same dress, the miserable cloak and hood, the form, the voice, the accent, the
                  plaintive sound he had once heard before, and never had forgotten; and he was wild
                  in his excitement.</p>
               <p>"Who are you, woman?" he muttered.</p>
               <p>"Marie—your friend."</p>
               <p>"Where is <emph>she?</emph> What has become of <emph>her?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Your patron? She has gone. Be calm—you will see her no more. She did wrong to
                  tease you thus. She will not return."</p>
               <p>"Let me see her. I will see her!" he continued, starting up fiercely. "Bring her
                  back! What means this cursed jugglery and imposition? Where am I? Are you not
                  Marie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, monsieur—your constant friend."</p>
               <p>"Are you not <emph>she?</emph> The beggar, Marie, and she are one. You are
                  Maria—you are my tormentor! Take off the mask; remove this ghostly cloak!"
                  continued Wilford, furiously, as he seized the beggar's arm, and wrested the hood
                  from her face. "I will see your face, at cost of life!"</p>
               <p>The cloak and bonnet fell upon the carpet, and there, before his astounded gaze,
                  with all her gentle innocence and beauty, in her simple home attire, stood
                  Nelly—Noell's child!</p>
               <p>This was too much for the nerves of Alfred Wilford; he looked but once, reeled
                  forward, and fell headlong into the arms of the lady's attendant, who at that
                  moment sprang to his mistress's side.</p>
               <p>"Raise him upon the sofa, Louis; it is only temporary faintness; he will quickly
                  recover, Here, place this to his nostrils; there—sh!—that will do. Be prudent,
                  Louis; silent! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Comprennez vous?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>The servant nodded, and Nelly disappeared. A moment afterwards, Wilford was taken
                  quietly to his carriage, which was in waiting at the door, and, attended by Louis,
                  he was at once conveyed to his lodgings, and safely bestowed for the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.</head>
               <p>WILFORD passed such a night as he had never experienced before in his short life.
                  A thousand conflicting thoughts and fears and suppositions crowded on his brain,
                  and he narrowly escaped a serious fever from the effect produced by his excitement
                  and consternation.</p>
               <p>Nelly <emph>was</emph> alive He had seen her, talked with her, held her hand in
                  his, and for months, ay, for two long years, he now saw how she had watched over
                  him, guarded him from temptation, and served him with unexampled generosity. And
                     <emph>she</emph>—his guardian, Nelly—was the disguised beggar-girl, who had
                  communicated with him in so gentle and tender a manner. She was his
                     <emph>Marie!</emph> She was his noble, generous patron, too!</p>
               <p>And she was <emph>rich</emph>. That could hardly be, however, he thought, for they
                  were very poor when Wilford knew them. How was this! She had paid him a thousand
                  golden louis d'ors for his "Madonna." And then she had offered him her hand and
                  "fortune," which she averred was ample—for she was the "lady in sables," also.
                  Strange being—strange—liberal—affectionate—beautiful—loving—devoted Nelly
                  Noell!</p>
               <p>Ah, how the grateful heart of the boy-artist turned back to the time when he lay a
                  helpless wounded stranger, beneath the hospitable roof of the poor light-keeper.
                  How his pulse quickened at the recollection of the thousand kindnesses which Noell
                  and his daughter had showered on him amid his jeopardy, his illness, and his
                  poverty! And then came up the lovely form of her to whom he was now affianced.
                  Helen looked on him, with her deep, "lustrous, heavenly eyes of blue," and he saw
                  her as she moved in the brilliant circle she adorned—the matchless queen of
                  beauty, grace and gentleness. Whither could he now turn, and what must be the
                  result of this carious, wonderful, happy—yet fearful discovery?</p>
               <p>De Brandt was <emph>not</emph> a marquis. At least so Marie—Nelly had declared;
                  and Helen was not the daughter of nobility. Then was Wilford more her equal, and
                  he could marry her without that feeling of dependence which her higher station
                  might suggest. But what had he to do with Helen, or her station, now! Nelly still
                  lived. But, what was <emph>he to her?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Wed!" he suddenly exclaimed, "wed—<emph>whom?</emph>" Would he,
                     <emph>could</emph> he lead to the altar the daughter of the so-called marquis,
                  and Nelly yet alive? That Nelly of his dreams, whom he had pictured, praised, and
                  loved? How then could he escape from his contract of honor with the charming
                  beauty who had entranced him, and whom he was so wholly devoted to, up to this
                  almost fatal hour? Would Helen release him? She couldn't, should not do it. His
                  peace was too deeply perilled by this thought; yet Nelly lived, and she had
                  offered to become his wife. What could he say to de Brandt and his daughter, in
                  explanation? A prior attachment—boyish love, gratitude to Noell, romance, faugh!
                  Wilford was sick at heart.</p>
               <p>Then came the sober second thought. De Brandt was not a marquis. They had deceived
                  him, cajoled him, as Nelly had declared. What right had they thus to make him
                  their victim? He would resent this monstrous imposition, on the instant, and call
                  the "marquis" to account for his deceit and treachery! He would quarrel with de
                  Brandt, fight him, slay him, for the egregious wrong he had thus committed. He had
                  good right, he believed, to demand satisfaction, imperiously, at the hands of this
                  deceiver, or his extraordinary conduct, and unprincipled chicanery.</p>
               <p>"Quarrel with de Brandt! For what?" he continued, as fresh thoughts of the past
                  thronged upon his half bewildered brain; "fight him? How, and why? Because the
                  marquis, or whoever he was, had strained every nerve, apparently, to drive the
                  artist from his daughter's favor? Quarrel with him, when he remembered that de
                  Brandt had offered him ten, twenty, fifty thousand crowns to renounce her? Demand
                  reparation of the father of the woman whom he had sought out and followed up, for
                  months, against that parent's wishes, and his clearly expressed commands to the
                  contrary? This was folly, stupidity, rank injustice!</p>
               <p>But de Brandt was not a marquis. What of that? The father of Alfred Wilford was a
                  poor game-keeper. Perhaps de Brandt had been once a fish-monger. And if he were,
                  what was all that to him? He had urged his own suit with Helen, he had
                  accomplished, by dint of all his own art and talent and ingenuity, the highest of
                  his earthly hopes, almost—and he had been the sole carver of his own fortune, thus
                  far, be it good or ill. There were none to blame, no one to chide, nor quarrel
                  with, but himself. De Brandt had the undoubted right to call himself by such name
                  or title as best suited his convenience or tastes—and Wilford finally saw himself
                  as he was, but a poor, simple, humble painter, whom the fates had evidently
                  singled out for persecution!</p>
               <p>But, would he submit to all this? Could be tamely consent thus to be the football
                  of fickle fortune, without some chance of hope for extrication from this terrible
                  dilemma?</p>
               <p>Morning dawned, at last. He arose from his sleepless pillow, and in the midst of
                  his misgivings and uncertainty, Manfred found him, at his hotel.</p>
               <p>"Come, my dear fellow," said his friend, gaily, "where were you truanting again
                  last night? Didn't you promise to meet me at the hotel of the marquis? I waited
                  there for you till midnight, and the ladies were especially anxious about
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Manfred," said Wilford, seriously, "how do I look, to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Well, upon my word, I did not notice it, before; but what the deuce has come over
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"I was called away last evening, Manfred, just as I had ordered my carriage to
                  wait upon the marquis."</p>
               <p>"Business, do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. That is—it has proved a pretty serious business for <emph>me,</emph> and you
                  are likewise implicated."</p>
               <p>"What has happened, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Your fine 'marquis' de Brandt is no marquis at all, miboy."</p>
               <p>"<emph>No marquis!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Nothing of the kind, I can assure you, Manfred."</p>
               <p>"Well, this <emph>is</emph> delightful. I beg you explain yourself."</p>
               <p>"The summons I received was the favor of a lady whom I had met before. I responded
                  to it, and found my friend, the 'lady in sables,' whom you remember at Venice, in
                  waiting for me, at her lodgings."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Bah!</emph>" exclaimed Manfred, with a sneer, "is <emph>this</emph> your
                  authority?"</p>
               <p>"Bear with me one moment, my good friend," continued Wilford, solemnly; "you shall
                  soon see what my story and my authority are worth."</p>
               <p>"It is the old story, Wilford, of course. Do you suppose that I haven't been round
                  the world long enough to know how these things are managed?"</p>
               <p>"But hear me, Manfred."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, miboy, this 'lady in black' is a vastly clever woman."</p>
               <p>"You are right there," said the artist.</p>
               <p>"She has conceived a passion for you," continued<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000040"/> tinued Manfred, rapidly, "such as a thousand women
                  in Europe before her have conceived for sentimental young gentlemen like yourself,
                  and she is resolved that you shall marry her, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Manfred!"</p>
               <p>"I told you long ago, to avoid her. It would have been well for you had you taken
                  my advice."</p>
               <p>"You are wrong, Manfred, all wrong, as you shall see."</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't want to hear any such authority as this quoted to vilify my noble
                  friend, the marquis. Why, man! Where are <emph>your</emph> interests, in this
                  matter? Are you not quite as deeply involved as <emph>I</emph>, to be sure? What
                  of the Lady Helen?"</p>
               <p>"I know it, I know it all, Manfred. Still I repeat it, the marquis is
                     <emph>no</emph> marquis; he is an impostor, and the ladies are not scions of
                  nobility."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe it, I tell you!"</p>
               <p>"I will convince you that we have been deceived."</p>
               <p>"Well then, go on."</p>
               <p>"I attended the summons I received, last evening, and found the lady I have
                  mentioned. She was attired as usual, masked and unknown to me."</p>
               <p>"I would have torn the domino from her face, if it had cost me half my fortune,"
                  said Manfred, resolutely.</p>
               <p>"And so would I, my friend. Be quiet. She repeated to me as she has done before,
                  how dearly she loved me—"</p>
               <p>"Of course."</p>
               <p>"How well she knew me, and what she would do for me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, exactly."</p>
               <p>"Recapitulated all the plans and events of my life, and again urged me to accept
                  her hand and splendid fortune."</p>
               <p>"Just as I supposed," said Manfred, exultantly.</p>
               <p>"She declared to me that de Brandt was no marquis at all, and suddenly assured me,
                  when I spoke of Noell, that his daughter Nelly was still living!"</p>
               <p>"And you believed all she said, of course?"</p>
               <p>"I believed what I saw with my own eyes, Manfred. Startled at this singular
                  account, I turned away, and a moment afterwards, I looked for my strange
                  informant, and she was gone."</p>
               <p>"And that was all, oh!"</p>
               <p>"No, Manfred! That was not all. The lady had departed, and to my astonishment, in
                  her place, stood the beggar-girl of the Pont dec Fleurs, of whom you have heard me
                  speak."</p>
               <p>"Your <emph>Marie?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, 'Marie,' as she called herself."</p>
               <p>"Another imposture, of course."</p>
               <p>"Not exactly. She was cloaked and hooded, but only gave me fair words. I seized
                  her arm, and demanded that she should show me her face. She resisted, we
                  struggled, the cloak and bonnet fell from her head and shoulders, and <emph>Nell
                     Noell stood before me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Who!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"The light-keeper's daughter."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Herself!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Her very self, Manfred."</p>
               <p>"You've been dreaming, miboy;" said his friend; "there is no doubt of this. What
                  charms or jugglery may have been practised upon you by this artful woman I cannot
                  say; but a singular result has been brought about. Keep yourself quiet or you will
                  be ill; your brain is over-tasked from some cause evidently, and you must now take
                  care of yourself."</p>
               <p>Manfred seriously thought that Wilford was out of the possession of his wits. He
                  took his hand and felt his pulse. Wilford forced a smile and said:</p>
               <p>"Ah, my friend! I am all right <emph>here</emph>," placing his hand to his head;
                  "and this is too serious a matter to jest about."</p>
               <p>"I am disposed to be as serious as yourself, if there is any reality in all this.
                  But really, miboy, I cannot think but that you have been deceived," said
                  Manfred.</p>
               <p>"Harry Noell is now in Paris, my friend," said Wilford.</p>
               <p>"Are you certain?"</p>
               <p>"Did we not see him only yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"You thought you did, I know."</p>
               <p>"He lives, I assure you: and is now in town."</p>
               <p>"Did she say so?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes."</p>
               <p>"And you feel sure, too, that it was <emph>his daughter</emph> whom you saw, and
                  who is the Marie and the 'lady in sables' you have so long been in concert
                  with?"</p>
               <p>"It were useless to waste words in such questions, Manfred. I saw her, spoke to
                  her, grasped her hand, and I confess the weakness—fainted at her feet!"</p>
               <p>"What succeeded this?"</p>
               <p>"I have not the slightest idea. When I awoke, I was in my own room at home. It was
                  near morning, since when I have tossed upon an uneasy pillow, as you may well
                  conceive; and here we are to devise the means if possible, to manage this strange
                  condition of affairs, judiciously."</p>
               <p>"It is a curious state of affairs, truly," replied Manfred, thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"The result of it all is plain enough," concluded Wilford. "The <choice>
                     <sic>marquis marquis</sic>
                     <corr>marquis</corr>
                  </choice> is no you may be sure. We have been tricked. My prospective marriage
                  with Helen de Brandt, or whoever she is, must be annulled. You will lose Hortense,
                  of course, and I am ruined."</p>
               <p>"Not quite so bad as all that, miboy."</p>
               <p>"But what can we do?"</p>
               <p>"Act like men, my dear fellow! I don't know what will come out of all this, but we
                  will see, we will see."</p>
               <p>"I am ready to join you in any plan you will suggest, that may savor of a feasible
                  show for escape from dishonor and disgrace, Manfred. But it appears to me almost a
                  hopeless chance."</p>
               <p>"Can you not see Nelly once more, immediately, and learn such particulars as may
                  throw farther light upon the character and intentions of the marquis, which may
                  aid us in this unexpected emergency?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. I will send a message to her, directly. Tarry here, then, till the
                  servant returns."</p>
               <p>A note was forth with despatched by a messenger, who was directed to find the lady
                  addressed, and await a reply. The letter asked for an interview with Nelly at the
                  earliest convenient moment.</p>
               <p>The lovers waited anxiously for half an hour, when the attendant returned with
                  Wilford's note, and brought the information that the lady left the hotel at
                  sunrise, and no one knew who she was, or where she had gone.</p>
               <p>Thus they were foiled!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WILFORD AND HELEN DE BRANDT.</head>
               <p>WHEN evening came, the young gentlemen were quite as far from learning anything
                  satisfactory to their wishes apparently, as they were in the morning of the busy
                  day now just closed. In vain had they rode the streets, or visited the quays, in
                  search of the missing Nelly, the yacht or Noell. No clue could be obtained to the
                  whereabouts of either one or the other. At last they determined to call at the
                  residence of the self-styled <foreign xml:lang="FRA">marquis</foreign>, where
                  possibly some information could be had that might satisfy them.</p>
               <p>The beautiful Helen and Hortense never appeared in finer spirits, or to better
                  advantage than on this occasion. The former was peculiarly happy, and Wilford's
                  deportment was strangely in contrast with that of the young ladies. He was
                  depressed, moody and reserved. Helen rallied him.</p>
               <p>"I have news for you, monsieur," she said, pleasantly; "and I think it will help
                  to raise your seemingly drooping spirits. I hear that 'Nelly,' your charming
                  light-keeper's daughter, has just arrived in Paris, mysteriously."</p>
               <p>Hortense had withdrawn from the room, in company with Manfred, and the other
                  lovers sat alone, together.</p>
               <p>"I had heard of this, Helen," said Wilford, mournfully, "and I cannot understand
                  why you should suppose that this extraordinary circumstance could be so intensely
                  interesting to <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why, is not this Nelly your beau ideal of a lovely woman? I am sure I have heard
                  you say so, scores of times."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. I have said so."</p>
               <p>"And you have added too, Wilford, artist-flatterer that you are, you have even
                  added that, your Helen resembled her, strongly."</p>
               <p>"That is also true. The first time I saw you, Manfred will recollect that I spoke
                  of the strikingly remarkable similitude that existed between your face and that of
                  Nelly."</p>
               <p>"Have you met her, yet?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, for a few minutes."</p>
               <p>"When?</p>
               <p>"Last evening, at her hotel."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the beauty, affecting surprise, "then it was in the charming
                  Nelly's society you were engaged, while we were waiting for and expecting you,
                  momentarily, all the evening?"</p>
               <p>"I confess that I was thus engaged," said Wilford, humbly.</p>
               <p>"And is she looking as engaging and beautiful as ever, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon
                     amie?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"No, Helen. That is, I thought her paler and more anxious in her looks, than was
                  her former wont. But really, she favors you, astonishingly. Not so tall, I think,
                  as yourself, and somewhat less rotundity of form, but very like you, else."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am rejoiced that they came just as they did. Father has seen Noell,
                  Nelly's parent, who accompanies her, too, and fancies him. You should see our new
                  yacht, Wilford, a very gem of a boat, that father ordered before we left the
                  south, and which now lies in the stream."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>have</emph> seen her;" said Wilford, moodily.</p>
               <p>"Isn't she a love of a thing?"</p>
               <p>"She is very pretty."</p>
               <p>"The <name>Waif</name> he calls her a delightful name,</p>
               <p>"Yes. I have seen a 'Waif,' before," said Wilford.</p>
               <p>"So Noell said. I think he had a similar boat, once."</p>
               <p>"He did, yes."</p>
               <p>"Father has engaged this Noell to take charge of the Waif, so he says, as
                  pilot—when we go to England, shortly. He is <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au
                     fait</foreign> at this business, I think, is he not, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," he replied—or "<emph>no</emph>," as it happened! His thoughts were far
                  from the subjects upon which Helen was speaking.</p>
               <p>"Are you ill, to-night, monsieur?" asked Helen at length, finding that she could
                  not arouse her lover. "Are you sick?"</p>
               <p>"Sick at heart, sweet Helen."</p>
               <p>"Of what, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Helen de Brandt! If you could read the emotions that throng upon me, at this
                  news, if you could appreciate the misery that surrounds me, the strange,
                  conflicting, unutterable throbbings that this intelligence has caused me, you
                  would deem my case a hard and unhappy one, at this moment."</p>
               <p>"But what has happened, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Helen! Do you believe I love you?" asked Wilford, suddenly appealing directly to
                  the heart of his betrothed, so earnest was his tone and manner. "Do you think I
                  love you?"</p>
               <p>"Can I doubt you, Wilford? Have we not plighted our troth? Why such a
                  question?"</p>
               <p>"When I look into your eyes, dear Helen, I see the soul of Nelly Noell, peering
                  from them, in spite of all my convictions and efforts to the contrary. If I tell
                  you I love another—Helen—at this late hour; if I point you to that love, and show
                  you how meek and gentle she was, how untiringly devoted to my weal; if I show you
                  how worthy she is, and how her poor heart will bleed, to see me taken from her
                  forever; if I satisfy you that she is still loving, gentle, resigned, submissive
                  even to the fate that she fears awaits her—you will forgive me for the truancy,
                  you will lend me, and her your sympathy, will you not?"</p>
               <p>"Wilford, I am all amazement! What means this speech to me?"</p>
               <p>"Do not chide me, Helen."</p>
               <p>"Did you not offer me your heart and hand, together?"</p>
               <p>"I did—I did!"</p>
               <p>"And I accepted the proffer, O, how gratefully. You cannot give me half a heart,
                  Wilford! You cannot divide the gift, though it be priceless in value. It is mine.
                  Mine by possession, mine of right, mine, because it was your free, unasked-for
                  gift, mine by all the ties that earth can make binding, save the marriage
                  form—mine wholly, undivided, indisputably, irrevocably mine!"</p>
               <p>"Still, Helen, if I had no heart to give—"</p>
               <p>"Do not speak to me thus, Wilford. I did not fear this confession, though I knew
                  how gratefully you remembered the humble Noell's daughter. You cannot recede, your
                  solemn asseverations are registered in heaven; there is no relenting, no
                  appeal!"</p>
               <p>"Then must she perish!" exclaimed Wilford, fearfully. "She could not live, and
                  feel that another possessed the heart she knows beats so fondly for her."</p>
               <p>"You speak of Nelly, Wilford?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Helen. She is a tender flower, as gentle as a dove; and she will pine and
                  die, when she learns her fate."</p>
               <p>"No, Wilford, we will cherish her. You shall be her friend, her adviser, her
                  brother. I will love her as you love her. She shall be with us, and she will
                  continue to be near to you, to watch over and counsel you, as you say she has done
                  for years."</p>
               <p>"And you can permit this, Helen?"</p>
               <p>"I can do much for your sake, Wilford, that I could not for another's. I honor
                  your truth and devotion, and I will aid you to-render Nelly happy."</p>
               <p>"And you would not be jealous of her?"</p>
               <p>"That would be to demean myself in your esteem, surely."</p>
               <p>"And Nelly shall be near to you, you say?"</p>
               <p>"Dear as a sister."</p>
               <p>"And you will love her always?"</p>
               <p>"Next to you, dear Wilford, I will honor and respect her."</p>
               <p>"Then am I happy, indeed! You must see her, Helen, you will prize her, I am
                  sure."</p>
               <p>"I have seen her, Wilford."</p>
               <p>"When and where?"</p>
               <p>"To-day, she has been here with her father."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5956-00000042"/>
               <p>The servant entered at this moment, and announced "Mr. Noell."</p>
               <p>"He's welcome," said Helen; "show him up."</p>
               <p>Wilford sprang forward as the light-keeper entered, and seized his extended hand
                  with a hearty good will. Noell was very glad to meet him, and an exceedingly
                  pleasant interview finished up the evening. He came to see de Brandt, he said, in
                  regard to sailing orders for the yacht. Everything was in readiness, on board, and
                  he only waited his pleasure to put to sea."</p>
               <p>Noell had grown old since Wilford last saw him, as nearly as the artist could
                  remember his looks; and when he retired, Helen spoke familiarly with him, and left
                  the room a moment. Wilford did not exactly understand this, but the light-keeper
                  and his daughter did!</p>
               <p>"It is full time," she said, in a whisper.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," said Noell. "All is ready now; he has been tried sufficiently.
                  Proceed, I will be within hearing of you."</p>
               <p>While all this was going on, Hortense and Manfred were loitering in the garden,
                  where everything had been fully explained by the former to her lover's entire
                  satisfaction; and they now only waited for the signal agreed on, to join in the
                  denouement which was rapidly approaching.</p>
               <p>Helen and Wilford were once more alone.</p>
               <p>"Do you observe no change in my appearance, to-night, Wilford?" she said. The room
                  was but dimly lighted, and his thoughts had been too intensely occupied with
                  matters of greater importance, to suggest to him any particular examination of her
                  dress or person.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, till now," he replied. "Your hair is auburn, and your face has lost its
                  ruddy glow. Come to the light, dear Helen, I did not believe you could be improved
                  in your features; but why have you thus transformed yourself?"</p>
               <p>They moved to the other end of the apartment, together, Helen leaning
                  affectionately upon his arm.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see <emph>this</emph> before, Wilford?" she asked, raising her
                  beautifully modelled hand, and pointing to a small diamond ring upon her slender
                  finger.</p>
               <p>"That ring, Helen! It was my mother's."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>
               <p>"Positive. I gave it to Nelly Noell, when we parted at Beachy Point."</p>
               <p>"There is no mistake, eh, Wilford?" continued Helen.</p>
               <p>The artist looked up—passed his hand to his forehead—gazed for an instant into
                  eyes that told the story he had been so dull in learning before, and shrieked;</p>
               <p>"<emph>My Nelly!</emph> Nel—" and swooning, was caught in the <choice>
                     <sic>stalwort</sic>
                     <corr>stalwart</corr>
                  </choice> arms of her father, <emph>Harry Noell!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The plot of the "marquis" was nearly completed.</p>
               <p>"Wilford!" shouted the light-keeper.</p>
               <p>"Joy, miboy," chimed in his friend Manfred; "I give you joy!"</p>
               <p>"Wilford! monsieur!" cried the pretty Hortense, advancing at the same instant. But
                  the happiness of that moment was too great for him.</p>
               <p>It would scarcely be generous for us to interfere, just now, with the scene that
                  followed this sudden breaking in of the light upon Wilford's senses. Suffice it,
                  there was joy at the quarters of Noell, that night! Such a shaking of hands, and
                  such exclamations of delight were exchanged, in a few moments after the
                  discovery—for Wilford's faintness lasted but a brief moment—such rejoicings and
                  congratulations as passed for the next hour there, were by no means common, even
                  in joyous, noisy Paris—and we will leave our friends, temporarily, in the midst of
                  their ecstacy.</p>

               <p>HARRY NOELL took an early opportunity to meet his two young friends after the
                  discovery that was exhibited to them, for the purpose of explaining himself.</p>
               <p>"I do not deem it necessary," he said to Wilford and Manfred, "to enter into any
                  minutiæ of detail in reference to myself, or the course I have thought it proper
                  to take, but I will give you, voluntarily, a brief <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >expose</foreign> of my intentions and my course since I saw you last.</p>
               <p>"I saw, even while Wilford was under my roof, that an attachment was growing up in
                  the heart of my daughter for him, and very soon after he left the light, I knew
                  that she had conceived a passion for him. I knew her disposition, and her mother's
                  before her—and I knew she would go to the world's end to carry her point. She
                  loved the artist, and she resolved to follow his fortunes.</p>
               <p>"I immediately determined to second her wishes, because I had no ties to bind me
                  to earth save the affections and the protection of my only child. After due
                  reflection and calculation for the future, I gathered together <emph>what little
                     fortune I was possessed of</emph> at the light, and with my yacht, which I
                  proposed to sell, at once, and my daughter, I left old Beachy Head, forever. I did
                  not deem it necessary to give any information as to what my future destination
                  would be, indeed, at that time, I was ignorant of this myself, and at midnight, I
                  set sail from the Point, without notice or warning to any one, lest my future
                  plans might by this means be impeded or perhaps frustrated altogether.</p>
               <p>"The two scoundrels who had deceived me for weeks previously to my leaving home,
                  under pretence of being government officials, undoubtedly set fire to the
                  light-house, soon after we left; be that as it may, I know nothing of it save what
                  I met with in the journals of that day. This seemed a fortunate circumstance for
                  me, however, since it was believed that both myself and my child had been then
                  destroyed amidst the ruins of the razed light. I did not omit to turn this fact to
                  immediate advantage, as you will see.</p>
               <p>"We arrived, after a prosperous and brief voyage, at a port on the extreme
                  southerly coast of France, which I knew to be the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >locale</foreign> of a horde of the smuggling fraternity; I found no difficulty
                  within a few hours after my yacht was seen, in disposing of her. Her name and all
                  traces of her origin and ownership I had carefully removed, and when I placed her
                  in possession of her new owners, they counted me down two thousand golden louis
                  for her, quite her full value.</p>
               <p>"I then proceeded to turn what <emph>other little property I had</emph> into cash
                  and letters of credit,<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5956-00000043"/> until at last I
                  found myself quite in funds, for <emph>me,</emph> and I proceeded to travel, with
                  my daughter, in search of Wilford, whom I afterwards heard of in Paris. I chanced
                  to fall in with Madame Dessaret, in the meantime, at Marseilles. Her fortune was
                  very large, and I proposed to unite my own with hers," continued Noell. "But you
                  smile, Manfred," he said, observing that his last sentence caused a sensation.</p>
               <p>"'<emph>Your</emph> fortune with <emph>hers,</emph> you said.'"</p>
               <p>"Yes. O, my means, of course, were not so great as some people would crave; but
                  then I assure you I was not so poor as a good many others in the world, by any
                  means. However, madame has enough! We united our fortunes, I married her, and we
                  were both happier and richer for the change we made. Madame had two
                  children—Hortense and an invalid boy, lately deceased, and with our son and
                  daughters we retired to la Realle, and lived in handsome style there, under an
                  assumed name and title.</p>
               <p>"De Brandt was madame's maiden name. For my own reasons, we took this cognomen. I
                  affixed the title of 'marquis' to it, in order the more completely to ward off
                  suspicion, and to farther the plan I had for the future; and, when time had
                  ruffled my face a little, and certain changes had come about that sufficiently
                  disguised my person—I took my family, and we sat down in Paris, where we could
                  better watch our bird and finish up our scheme, now so fairly in progress.</p>
               <p>Nelly had had the use of such pecuniary means in the meanwhile, as she desired.
                  She went and came, attended by devoted and faithful servants, who had been learned
                     <emph>not</emph> to talk; and from time to time she kept her father advised of
                  all her little plans and disguises with the artist, and which I approved. It was
                  thus she kept his mind occupied, and the romance and excitement of his apparent
                  perplexing intrigues with <emph>Marie,</emph> and the <emph>beggar-girl,</emph>
                  and the <emph>lady in sables,</emph> and, finally with <emph>Helen,</emph> served
                  to keep his spirits up, and push him forward in his art and his little
                  fortune.</p>
               <p>"You met us, gentlemen, at our hotel in Paris. You remember the impressions of
                  that night, when you first saw the family of the 'Marquis de Brandt.' You made
                  your game on that occasion, you have played briskly and artistically, since, and
                  you have well-nigh won! You will not have forgotten the agreeable days and scenes
                  we enjoyed together at Venice; you saw us as <emph>we were,</emph> you now know us
                  as <emph>we are.</emph> I propose to proceed to London soon, and to settle finally
                  in England, once more, for we must not, amid our success and our joy, my boys,
                  forget our native land, you know!"</p>
               <p>"That is good news, too," said Manfred, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Are you satisfied with my explanation, young gentlemen?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly, entirely. It was admirably managed," said both the young friends, in
                  one voice.</p>
               <p>"'Tis well, then. I am not desirous to meet any of my Paris acquaintances here, at
                  present, or at least until the explanation of my course shall have become public.
                  So, we shall depart at an early day, and in the meantime, I am known as Noell,
                  only, remember. My daughter's name is <emph>Helen,</emph> Wilford—after her
                  mother, whom we lost in her early years. We have called her 'Nell' however, for
                  brevity, and from habit from her infancy. You were not very grossly deceived in
                  this, at any rate."</p>
               <p>"Nelly, or Nell—or Helen, she is the same to me," responded Wilford, joyfully. "I
                  am content. Are we to join you, on your return to England, Noell?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly; that is all we wait for."</p>
               <p>"I am ready," said Manfred.</p>
               <p>"And I will be ready, in a day or two," added Wilford, who had some matters of
                  business that he was obliged to close up before leaving town. "How shall we
                  go?"</p>
               <p>"You forget the <name>Waif</name>, my son?" asked Noell.</p>
               <p>"O, yes, we have seen her."</p>
               <p>"The yacht is hard by; a 'copy of the original,' Wilford, as you artists would
                  say."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>not</emph> the original?" queried the painter.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I inform you that I had <emph>sold</emph> her? My present boat I had built
                  as you sometimes paint good pictures, you know; from impressions and
                  recollection."</p>
               <p>"Well, you have succeeded quite as well with the yacht as Wilford did with the
                  portrait of his 'Nelly,'" said Manfred. "The Waif of to-day is a perfect likeness
                  of the other, and we both supposed her to be the same."</p>
               <p>"Well, we shall return in her to England," continued Noell. "Be in readiness, if
                  possible, then, the day after to-morrow, Wilford. In the meantime, you know, the
                  young ladies and the 'marchioness' that <emph>was,</emph> will be happy to see you
                  both, often. And so, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoir!</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Before her mother was taken away by death, Nelly had had the advantage of her
                  attentive instruction struction and undivided care. The first wife of Noell was a
                  French lady, by birth, and she had taken great pains to give her only child a
                  knowledge of her native language. Thus, with what she had learned at home, and the
                  subsequent attention she gave to the subject on her arrival in France, she very
                  soon became <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au fait</foreign> in the Provincial French
                  tongue; and afterwards acquired a ready pronunciation of the language of Paris,
                  between which, two there is as great a difference of dialect as exists between
                  that of an "honest Yorkshireman," and a London cockney.</p>
               <p>It will have been observed that Noell had been extremely modest and cautious, in
                  speaking about his own individual fortune. It was supposed that his marriage with
                  his second wife had made him rich, and he always humored and encouraged this
                  belief, never alluding to his own means, or how he had acquired it. The
                  supposition that his lady's fortune was the bulk of their property, and the
                  knowledge that, at any rate, their income was enormously large, was sufficient to
                  deter the asking of questions. As no one inquired about the point, so Noell never
                  had occasion to allude to it.</p>
               <p>The studio of the artist was closed at last. His few unsold pictures were added to
                  the splendid gallery that Helen had gathered together, from time to time, and when
                  finally arranged, though modest in numbers, formed one of the choicest private
                  collections to be found—foremost among which, were seen Wilford's elaborate
                  "Madonna" and his famous "light-keeper's daughter."</p>
               <p>The yacht was in readiness for the reception of its company. The morning on which
                  they designed to sail for England was a delightful one, and the party were all in
                  excellent spirits. Noell was <emph>really</emph> engaged as "pilot," as Nelly had
                  informed her lover; and the skipper now only awaited the arrival of his master to
                  put to sea. The wind blew fresh from the coast, and the prospect of a speedy and
                  pleasant homeward trip was very promising.</p>

               <head type="sub">BURTON HOUSE. ENGLAND. HOME.</head>
               <p>UPON the day succeeding this explanation of Noell, the remainder of his reserved
                  household, carriages, horses, grooms and servants reached Paris, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> to England, in charge of his chief <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">intendante</foreign>, or steward. Everything was immediately put
                  in train for departure. The establishment was at once sent forward by land as far
                  as Calais, whence everything was embarked in good order and safety, for Dover. The
                  yacht was in readiness to receive the family, and all was now completed for
                  sailing.</p>
               <p>"Come, boys, lively, now!" said Noell, as the two young gentlemen reached the
                  quai, with their luggage. "Lively, and let's get on board, as briskly as possible.
                  The wind favors us this fine morning, and we shall have a capital run across the
                  Straits. Bear-a-hand with this luggage, Louis. Come, gentlemen. The ladies are on
                  board, and all is ready for us."</p>
               <p>In a few minutes they had embarked, the jib was run up, the mainsail filled away
                  with the freshening breeze, and the Waif, with its precious burthen, put gallantly
                  down the river.</p>
               <p>"Where will you land, Noell?" asked Manfred.</p>
               <p>"I propose to run up the Thames, and stop in London a few days," said Noell,
                  "where I shall find business, for a time."</p>
               <p>"London! What the deuce have you to do with the metropolis? I supposed, of course,
                  you would proceed at once to Dover, and thence to Burton House. I shall hear to
                  nothing else, at present, certainly."</p>
               <p>"My dear boy! What will you do with us all at Burton House? They will think we
                  come to take them by storm, if we tumble in there, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans
                     ceremonie</foreign>, as you suggest."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, my friend. I have already prepared for this; and my father is now
                  looking, hourly for our arrival. We must proceed to Dover, direct. And if you are
                  'pilot' of this craft, as I learned from the young ladies you were engaged for
                  this post, I insist that you make for that port, with all despatch.
                     <emph>We</emph> are not going to London, at any rate," continued Manfred,
                  turning to Wilford for aid.</p>
               <p>"No, no. <emph>I</emph> have no call there," said the artist—"except," he added,
                  "it be to pay my respects to the incomparable Miss Simplon, miboy—eh?"</p>
               <p>"And see here, Noell," continued Manfred, drawing a letter from his pocket, that
                  he received from home just before leaving Paris, "see this. It isn't private, you
                  can read it. It is from my father—five days ago."</p>
               <p>"I shall anticipate your coming," ran the letter, "with sincere pleasure, I assure
                  you, under the circumstances, my dear son. On no account whatever, permit Noell
                  and his family, with our friend Wilford, to halt any where else in England, until
                  we have enjoyed a long visit from them, at Burton House. Make this a point not to
                  be declined or evaded. I have arranged at Dover to be informed of the fact the
                  moment the Waif is signalized, when our carriages will be sent to the dock to bear
                  you all to the homestead. Let me repeat it, then, I cannot be disappointed. We
                  have prepared for a grand time when you arrive, and I trust that your voyage may
                  be a brief and happy one. You will not omit, of course, to be the bearer of my
                  regards to Noell and his estimable wife; and remember your father affectionately
                  to the young ladies and your friend Wilford, all of whom we are anxious to take by
                  the hand."</p>
               <p>"Now, what do you say, Noell?"</p>
               <p>"Say?" replied Noell, quickly, turning to his helmsman, "put her away a point or
                  two, Norton, to the southward and westward."</p>
               <p>"She is headed duly for Sheppey Island Light, monsieur," said the man at the helm,
                  respectfully.</p>
               <p>"Put her away. We land at Dover, Norton."</p>
               <p>After a beautiful trip up the channel, the Waif rounded Sheppey Island, and a
                  telegraphic signal from Dover heights informed the residents at Burton House that
                  she had arrived. Carriages were instantly sent off to receive them, and in a
                  little time they reached the magnificent estate of the Manfreds, where they were
                  most cordially and hospitably bestowed, for the present.</p>
               <p>While the young ladies and gentlemen enjoyed themselves at Burton House, Noell
                  went up to London for a day or two. He felt it due to his government to enter into
                  some explanation of his conduct, now that he had returned permanently to his
                  native land, and for this reason he embraced an early opportunity to wait upon the
                  Secretary of the Department to whom he owed his original appointment to the post
                  of light-keeper at Beachy Head.</p>
               <p>He reached the city seasonably, and repaired at once to the proper quarter to
                  report himself. His card was sent to the head of the department, who looked at it
                  a moment, and said, after a little reflection:</p>
               <p>"Noell—Noell?" Then turning to the chief clerk of one of the bureaux, he said,
                  "Noell, is not that the name of the former keeper of the light at Beachy
                  Head?"</p>
               <p>The books were turned to, and the clerk said, "yes; it was Harrison Noell."</p>
               <p>"H. Noell," continued the secretary. "It is the same, I think. Show him in."</p>
               <p>Our friend made himself known, at once. He explained his absence in his own way,
                  without any apparent wish to deceive, and the department accepted it. He said he
                  had got wearied with the duties at Beachy Head, and a good opportunity suddenly
                  turned up, which he was compelled to avail himself of at a moment's warning, or
                  lose it. He was the owner of a handsome yacht, which he took to France and sold,
                  and began the world over again," to use his own words, in the hope of there
                  acquiring a fortune. He left letters behind him when he sailed, requesting a
                  neighbor to come down and see to the lights, until a new appointment could arrive
                  to take his vacated place, and believing that all would go on right, without
                  trouble to the department.</p>
               <p>Soon after his arrival in France, he learned of the destruction of the premises,
                  by fire. The two men who came there with forged credentials, and who contrived,
                  also, to have sent down to him, a letter by mail, purporting to come from the
                  secretary—endorsing them and their objects—were impostors; and undoubtedly fired
                  the building, after robbing it. <emph>He</emph> was supposed to have been burned
                  in the ruins, and he did not contradict the story for private reasons of his own,
                  which would not interest the government. He had absented himself, voluntarily, and
                  now he returned voluntarily to England. His aim had been accomplished—he had been
                  eminently successful—and he was ready to answer to his government in any manner
                  they might think proper to institute, etc., etc.</p>
               <p>Now Harry Noell was quite as zealous as a great many other petty office-holders
                  under government have been, before and after him—who imagine themselves of such
                  immense importance in their places, that they seem to believe the wheels of the
                  national car (almost) must stop, if they withdraw suddenly from the service! A
                  very common opinion, this, but a very fallacious one.</p>
               <p>The fact was, Noell was never <emph>personally</emph> known at the department, at
                  all. As soon as his absence was known, a poor relative of the secretary applied
                  for the place; and that functionary made up his mind that Noell was burned up, or
                  had run away, either of which possible occurrences was equally fortunate for
                     <emph>him</emph>, as it made an opening for his wife's sister's husband's
                  cousin, and that was all he cared about the matter—forgetting<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC5956-00000045"/> ting, in another week, that any such man as Harry
                  Noell had ever existed.</p>
               <p>Now the light keeper had returned again, and it might be that he would want his
                  old place, again—for himself or another—for the secretary knew nothing about
                  Noell's present pecuniary condition, and so he got rid of him as quickly as
                  possible, lest he might become importunate, and informed him that the department
                  had not been put to inconvenience, in any way, by his sudden disappearance, since
                  the accident had occurred, a new building had been erected, and a new light-keeper
                  had been <emph>permanently</emph> appointed at Beachy Head. And furthermore, the
                  secretary gave him to understand that his explanation was perfectly satisfactory,
                  and if the department at any time, should have any further occasion to confer with
                  him, he would be communicated with by mail. The honorable secretary then bowed
                  Noell politely out, without even asking his future address!</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> difficulty is well got rid of, at any rate,' said Noell to
                  himself, exultantly. "The honorable secretary is a great man, I have no doubt—in
                  his own esteem! I wonder what is the length of his purse?" Then hailing a "fly,"
                  he jumped into it, and ordered the driver to the <hi rend="i"/>Royal George
                  Hotel.</p>
               <p>Preparations were now put afoot with becoming alacrity, and upon a scale of
                  magnificence commensurate with the positions and fortunes of Manfred and of
                  Helen's father, for the approaching marriages of the two young couples, whose
                  career we have traced to the present time.</p>
               <p>Burton House was the scene of unparalleled gaiety. Noell had returned from London,
                  bringing with him a liberal supply of jewels, dresses, and adornments for the
                  person of his beautiful daughter, and the hour was at last close at hand when the
                  lovers were finally to be joined in the holy bonds of matrimony.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">COUNT ARANTPUPPI.</head>
               <p>WITHIN the few months previously, there had come from abroad—it was said direct
                  from Italy, one Alphonse, the Count Arantpuppi; an artist of great distinction,
                  and a scion of one of the ancient families of nobility in Venice, as it was
                  understood.</p>
               <p>So far as looks went, the count was an exceedingly showy man, but illiterate, and
                  vain of his title and his personal appearance, to the very last degree. He soon
                  became involved in "fashionable" debts, at London, where he took up his residence;
                  and his tailor, his hatter, his hotel-keeper, and others whom he contrived from
                  month to month to impose upon, had got to be generous in number, and importunate
                  in their demands on him for unliquidated bills.</p>
               <p>Count Alphonse had a pretty name, and a glorious pair of whiskers and mustachios.
                  He managed to appear in fresh white kids and inimitable cravat nightly at the
                  theatre or the opera, and before he had been in the metropolis three months, half
                  a score of anxious mothers, who had "marriageable" but not very desirable
                  daughters, had made the acquaintance of his countship, with a view to calling him
                  son-in-law.</p>
               <p>It was his fortune to be petted even by the Lady Hallodale, whose wide circle of
                  acquaintances was, for the most part, composed of calculating maidens and
                  nobility-loving aunts. But the count was wary and business-like in his <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">devoirs</foreign>, and it was a difficult matter to entrap him.
                  He was determined upon "making a good thing" of his elegant contour and his
                  rapidly-spreading reputation, and he laid himself out for securing a fortune at
                  any rate, with the person of the prettiest woman he could inveigle into marriage
                  with him.</p>
               <p>In vain did the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenues</foreign> of London and
                  vicinity, who visited his saloon, and made party after party to catch him, in vain
                  did they throw out their questionable and tainted baits! Count Alphonse had been
                  too long an observer of men and women, so he imagined, to be deluded or cajoled.
                  He kept aloof, painted an indifferent picture, occasionally, attended zealously to
                  his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mustache</foreign> and silky locks, and squandered
                  every shilling he could raise, as fast as it came into his possession—continuing,
                  at the same time, to get deeper and deeper into debt, from week to week, as he
                  went on in admirable fashionable dissipation.</p>
               <p>"O, Charlotte!" shouted Laura, to her friend Miss Simplon, one day, as she
                  returned from a morning's ride; "Charlotte, <emph>have</emph> you seen the
                  charming Count Arantpuppi, who has recently dropped down among us, in town,
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"I have heard of him, and have promised the Littles that I would call at his
                  studio with them,<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5956-00000046"/> to-morrow. They tell me
                  he is a splendid looking man, and a magnificent artist."</p>
               <p>"So I hear, Charlotte. The praises of the Count Alphonse—isn't it a sweet
                  name?—are upon everybody's lips; and he is sought after by all our acquaintances,
                  as a trump card."</p>
               <p>"I have so understood it Laura. I shall have the pleasure of meeting him,
                     to-morrow—<emph>casually</emph>, you know, Laura—only casually; and I shall
                  then be able to decide whether report speaks correctly."</p>
               <p>"Exactly, Charlotte. You are a judge."</p>
               <p>"I rather flatter myself, Laura, that few women have had a better opportunity, at
                  my age, to know and judge of mankind, than I have."</p>
               <p>"That is very true, Charlotte; and you have evinced your good judgment, thus far,
                  by avoiding being deceived or caught by any of them."</p>
               <p>"Yes. There was Henry Payton, the merchant's son, of Picadilly. You remember him,
                  Laura, with his shining face and well brushed coat, how he pursued me, until I
                  forbade him, peremptorily, ever again to enter my presence?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I remember Payton. His father died, lately, and left him a hundred thousand
                  pounds, in the funds."</p>
               <p>"You don't say it, Laura!" exclaimed Charlotte, astounded. "Why, every one
                  declared that he was a poor fellow, dependent upon his daily business, for
                  bread!"</p>
               <p>"He was associated in trade, I believe—a silent partner, with his father, who died
                  richer than any one suspected him to be, while he lived."</p>
               <p>"What has become of Payton, Laura? He was a very clever young man, as we say in
                  English. I think he would be very glad to renew our acquaintance here, eh?"</p>
               <p>"I think it quite probable, Charlotte. Mr. Payton is announced to be married, I
                  notice, to the youngest daughter of Viscount Pallimerton, shortly."</p>
               <p>"Possible!"</p>
               <p>"So says the Court Journal, of last week. When he is married, I have no doubt we
                  can readily include the Paytons in our list of acquaintances."</p>
               <p>"Yes," responded Charlotte, thoughtfully, and at the same time questioning the
                  reasonableness of this idea!</p>
               <p>"Then there was the artist, Wilford, you know," continued Laura, reminding the now
                  fading beauty of another of her discarded suitors.</p>
               <p>"O, yes—yes. He was the most determined and passionate of them all!" said
                  Charlotte. "How the Manfreds could tolerate that man, was more than I could ever
                  conceive of."</p>
               <p>"He was a genius, Charlotte!"</p>
               <p>"A—fiddlestick! <emph>Genius?</emph> I saw a picture of Count Arantpuppi's, a day
                  or two since, that Lady Flemin purchased, which <emph>is</emph> a picture, to be
                  sure."</p>
               <p>"What was it?"</p>
               <p>"A female head."</p>
               <p>"Painted by the count?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Lady Flemin procured it of him, personally. He brought it with him from
                  Venice, I think—or Paris. <emph>This</emph> picture shows that <emph>genius</emph>
                  of which you speak. I really doubt if young Wilford ever could paint, at all, for
                  my part. The Manfreds spoiled him, and really made him think he had talent. I
                  assure you, he was not up to mediocrity."</p>
               <p>"Then he was fortunate to have so many true friends, who kept him so busy at
                  work."</p>
               <p>"Probably this was a charity, on their part. He was fit for nothing else, and the
                  occupation they afforded him kept him out of other mischief, probably. But, Laura,
                  that poor little fellow had the audacity to propose himself as a suitor to
                     <emph>me</emph>, you recollect! It was too ridiculous a thing for me to get
                  angry at, but I never could reconcile such presumption on the part of such humble
                  persons."</p>
               <p>"What has become of young Wilford, Charlotte?"</p>
               <p>"Run away, I think, quietly. I haven't heard of him, for a long time."</p>
               <p>"There is an artist by the name of Wilford who is largely spoken of in the French
                  journals, of late. Can this be he?"</p>
               <p>"O, no. He went to America, if I remember rightly. He might shine among the
                  Yankees, but he has no mission in this country, at all events. He couldn't live a
                  week in Paris, surely."</p>
               <p>"You are sure that the picture you speak of, is one of the count's efforts?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, of course. An original, which he finished some months ago, and brought to
                  England with him."</p>
               <p>"You have been luckily ridded of all these adventurers and poverty stricken
                  fellows, that thus crossed your path, Charlotte, and you should make a fortunate
                  match, at last, for the lessons you have had the opportunity to teach these
                  presumptuous luck-hunters, in your experience."</p>
               <p>"Have you chanced to meet this Count Alphonse, yet, Laura?"</p>
               <p>"Not to be presented. I was in at Cardori's, the hair-dresser's, on Tuesday, and
                  he chanced to stop a moment, as we passed out."</p>
               <p>"Is he really so handsome as they say he is?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and more so. I assure you he is an elegant representative of the fashionable
                  gentleman, if I can judge—to outward appearances, you know."</p>
               <p>"I see, I see. He is a nobleman, too, of course?"</p>
               <p>"O, yes. The Count Arantpuppi. A delightful name, too."</p>
               <p>"Very, Clara, very pretty. I shall have the pleasure of meeting him, to-morrow. It
                  is all planned, by aunty—but, of course, it is to be, as I said before, only a
                  casual call; a mere accidental arrangement. If he can paint, I will sit to him for
                  my picture."</p>
               <p>"Capital!" said Laura.</p>
               <p>"I shall thus be able to make his acquaintance, you know."</p>
               <p>"Romantic—very," continued Laura.</p>
               <p>"Not a word of this, out of this room, Laura."</p>
               <p>"Of course not, Charlotte."</p>
               <p>The pretty Miss Simplon retired to her boudoir, to think over this matter, and to
                  arrange for making "a hit," on the following day, when she should have the
                     <emph>honor</emph> of a presentation to the honorable <hi rend="i"/>Count
                  Alphonse, de Arantpuppi.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A MUTUAL MISTAKE!</head>
               <p>COUNT ALPHONSE was sitting in his flashy dressing gown that was yet unpaid for,
                  the next day, enjoying the comforts of his meerchaum at his studio. A carriage
                  halted at his door and a trio of ladies emerged from it and passed up into his
                  rooms. He received them in his customary magnificent style, and was very happy to
                  make the acquaintance of Miss Charlotte Simplon, to whom he was now introduced by
                  the Misses Little, that accompanied her.</p>
               <p>They were riding by, and merely called, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                     passant</foreign>, they said. Miss Simplon was a connoisseur in art—they told
                  the truth there, too!—and she desired to look at some of the count's latest works.
                  They passed an hour in his saloon, examining several pictures, half done, and
                  possessing but little merit, and finally were bowed out with a grace on the part
                  of his countship that would have caused a French dancing-master to blush, could he
                  have been a witness to his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">suavite</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">complaisance</foreign>.</p>
               <p>The count was greatly pleased with Miss Simplon, and at once made the most
                  particular inquiries about herself, her family, and her prospects, pecuniarily, of
                  course. The party to whom he at first applied, was only partially informed in
                  regard to the lady's means and family history. He had heard from several sources
                  that Miss Simplon was a very desirable person—of good descent, wealthy connexions,
                  handsome fortune, in her own right, and with high expectations from two sources,
                  on her father's side. This friend referred him to another party who did know her,
                  and this story was confirmed and improved.</p>
               <p>"She comes of a good family," said this informant. "Her present income is
                  generous, and her prospective property is very large. She would make a desirable
                  companion for anybody, and everybody was desirous to make favor with her."</p>
               <p>Count Alphonse resolved to marry Miss Charlotte Simplon, if the thing were
                  possible. He never met with the woman that so exactly answered his <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">beau ideal</foreign> of a dashing, splendid girl. And as she was
                  rich in the present and in the prospective, he thought he could afford to permit
                  her to exchange her name from Simplon to Arantpuppi if she would. And so he went
                  about the consummation of the business without unnecessary delay.</p>
               <p>Neither of the persons with whom the Count communicated, knew anything about the
                  temporal affairs of Miss Simplon, except what common rumor substantiated and aided
                  to keep in circulation. Arantpuppi believed her to be rich, he knew she was a
                  pretty woman, and he soon found his way into the circle she visited, principally
                  pally through the lady's own personal subsequent connivance.</p>
               <p>"And how were you pleased with the count?" inquired Laura, when she next met with
                  Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"O Laura, he's a love of a man, truly. I am not surprised that all the ladies
                  should be running after him. So polished, so graceful, so handsome—and then his
                  manner of speech, his pretty broken English, is so insinuating and so entirely
                  take-a-ble, that I was vastly pleased with him, to be sure."</p>
               <p>"And you have met him since?"</p>
               <p>"O yes, at the Littles'. And Laura, what did I tell you? He has proposed to
                  me—"</p>
               <p>"Proposed!"</p>
               <p>"To sit for my portrait, Laura; that is all, thus far. I shall attend him at his
                  studio, tomorrow."</p>
               <p>Miss Simplon was vanquished at last! There was no resisting that mustache and that
                  flowing beard, that nicely knotted cravat, and that pretty white hand.</p>
               <p>"And such an artist, too! Laura, when you get to be as good a judge of pictures as
                  I ought to be, you will say that the count, at any rate, is a most excellent and
                  accomplished painter, as well as a gentleman."</p>
               <p>"I understand that the picture he furnished your friend, and which has been so
                  greatly admired, is a very choice production," said Laura.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful! One of the prettiest faces imaginable, Laura; and the coloring is most
                  artistically executed."</p>
               <p>"But it is not his work, Charlotte, at all."</p>
               <p>"How do you know that? He brought it here—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he got it in Paris. It was painted by Mr. Wilford!"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, Laura, what does this signify? It is the result of rivalry, only."</p>
               <p>"But I assure you that the painting has been recognized by Wilford himself, who
                  chanced to see it at your friend's house, recently, and who declared that it was a
                  low priced and early effort of his, executed by him soon after his arrival on the
                  continent, months ago."</p>
               <p>Such was the fact! But Miss Simplon was entirely incredulous, and charged this
                  pretty piece of scandal, as she termed it, to envy.</p>
               <p>Miss Simplon sat for her portrait, and it was finished at last. It was the
                  likeness of a flashy woman, but poorly executed, and looked very little like the
                  gay and spirited coquette. But it had been painted by the Count Arantpuppi; and
                  though her friends could not admit it a picture of herself, yet she tried to
                  believe that it did her justice. Perhaps it did!</p>
               <p>As time passed by, the count became more and more intimate with Miss Simplon, and
                  he finally proposed to marry her. His offer was duly accepted, and the news was
                  duly spread among her coterie of acquaintances.</p>
               <p>"Charlotte Simplon is at length provided for," said Miss Little to her sister, one
                  morning. "She is announced as affianced."</p>
               <p>"To whom, pray?"</p>
               <p>"To the handsome Count Alphonse."</p>
               <p>"Alphonse?"</p>
               <p>"The painter—Arantpuppi," added the informant.</p>
               <p>"O yes. And is he wealthy, as they say?"</p>
               <p>"I never heard he was, at all. Did you?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly have so heard him spoken of. When is the marriage to take place?"</p>
               <p>"Very soon. Charlotte is now busy with the preliminaries."</p>
               <p>The count was present at the residence of Charlotte's guardian one evening, after
                  the arrangements had been made, in general terms, for their union.</p>
               <p>"Where are you to reside?" asked the lady's protector, of the flashy count, after
                  talking the matter over otherwise.</p>
               <p>"Wherever my lady may elect," said the count.</p>
               <p>"You have no choice?"</p>
               <p>"No, madame—except what Ma'am'selle Charlotte shuses. I'ave no preferaince."</p>
               <p>"In town, then?"</p>
               <p>"Oui, yais, madame."</p>
               <p>"What settlement do you propose, count?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Settel!</emph>" exclaimed the count, wildly, "that is bad word in
                  Anglaise." (He had heard this term used so often, of late, among those that had
                  waited upon him for his numerous unsettled accounts, that it amazed him!) "I shall
                  'ave no settlement, <emph>a present</emph> madame."</p>
               <p>"Some arrangement must be entered into, before she weds," said her guardian. "She
                  has no property of her own, of consequence, and it would be—"</p>
               <p>"No property, madame—wot zis mean?"</p>
               <p>"Charlotte has no property, yet—but, in the future, perhaps, when her relatives
                  decease—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Deceas?</emph> I'ave been und'stood she is very rich; and I have love
                  Ma'am'selle Charlotte vis<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5956-00000048"/> all my 'eart,
                  madame. But I vill make no settlement, and I vill consider more, before we sall go
                  no farther, madame."</p>
               <p>There was a mistake here, evidently! The count retired, went to his hotel, and
                  found a bailiff there awaiting his arrival! He was arrested for several debts, and
                  finding no friends that were desirous of making any "permanent investments" in his
                  complicated affairs, he was very unceremoniously taken off to Fleet Street Prison,
                  where he found leisure for reflection!</p>
               <p>There was a double mistake, as it turned out, eventually. Charlotte thought the
                  count a genuine nobleman. He was forced to throw off his assumed title and
                  disguise, and it was ascertained, subsequently, that he was a graceless and
                  dissolute Frenchman, who possessed some little talent as a copyist—who was
                  bankrupt in principle and purse, and who had fled from Boulogne and Paris to avoid
                  the debts he had contracted in France while pursuing a similar fortune-phantom,
                  there.</p>
               <p>Miss Simplon believed his story to the effect that he was wealthy, as well as
                  noble, and that he chose the profession of an artist only as a pastime. As soon as
                  his impudent plot was exploded, she was exceedingly mortified, and for a time was
                  sincerely distressed to know that she had been so easily deceived. But she found a
                  consolation in the reflection that she had very fortunately escaped marrying him;
                  and as there were more men left in the world, she very soon rallied, and forgot
                  this adventure.</p>
               <p>The portrait of Charlotte was never taken from the count's rooms. His meagre
                  effects were seized for the rent due, and his "splendid establishment" was broken
                  up. At a public vendue of his pictures, afterwards, the highest price that his
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chef-d'ouvres</foreign> commanded, was seventeen
                  shillings sterling!</p>
               <p>No event of this character could be long remembered by such a person as Miss
                  Simplon. She quickly forgot the count and, his blandishments, his genius and his
                  deceit. Her friends were too considerate and too generously inclined towards her,
                  in spite of her coquettish and silly faults, to remind her of him, or the
                  attendant circumstances of this queer affair; and she lost no caste in society by
                  the result of her intimacy with the "artist."</p>
               <p>The Count Arantpuppi was kept in durance for his unpaid debts several months; when
                  he was finally released, and permitted to return once more to the continent, or
                  elsewhere. He made the most of his opportunity and his liberty; and was never
                  afterwards seen in England.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FINAL UNION.</head>
               <p>DURING the absence of Noell at the metropolis, both young Manfred and Wilford had
                  taken the opportunity to explain to Mr. Manfred, senior, the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">marquis</foreign> affair.</p>
               <p>"Of course I see that he is not a marquis," said the old gentleman,
                  good-naturedly, "but how was it, my son, that in your letters, you spoke of 'De
                  Brandt' and the 'marquis,' if no such persons existed?"</p>
               <p>"Such was the title that Noell assumed, father, while he was on the continent, for
                  his own peculiar reasons. He travelled <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in cog.</foreign>,
                  and was known as De Brandt, from adopting the original family name of his second
                  wife. As to title of nobility, he doesn't need it, particularly; he is noble
                  enough in all the qualities that go to make up an honorable and good man."</p>
               <p>"But why did he deceive you?"</p>
               <p>"That was a part of his plan as I have explained to you. He would trust nobody but
                  himself and the immediate members of his family with his secret. He desired to
                  prove Wilford, and perhaps he entertained a similar feeling towards me. I never
                  asked the question."</p>
               <p>"I am not sorry that it has turned out precisely as it has," continued the old
                  Manfred. "You are now more nearly the equal—at least in station—of Hortense, to
                  whom you are about to be wedded. In point of fortune, you will have a generous
                  settlement, of course, though I understand that Noell's daughter will be very
                  wealthy from her mother's side. This is all convenient and fortunate, and I am
                  glad you do not have to contend with 'title' in your future."</p>
               <p>"As to this matter of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">marquis</foreign>, no one here
                  knows anything of it at all," added young Manfred. "It is common in Europe for
                  people of all grades to adopt such name or title as may suit their pleasure from
                  time to time; especially when flitting about from place to place on the continent.
                  I never attached any importance to it myself, and I am perfectly satisfied to take
                  my Hortense without any reference to her stepfather's acts, which I never doubted
                  he had good cause for."</p>
               <p>"You are content, so am I. You know my opinion of mere nominal 'nobility,'
                  Roswell. Let it pass."</p>
               <p>This subject was never again called up, and the family were known thenceforward
                  only as the Noell's.</p>
               <p>Among the guests who arrived about this time at Burton House, was a party from
                  London, in which the adorable Miss Simplon was included. Her late extravagant
                  partiality for <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rouge</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >enamel</foreign> had rendered her really <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >passe</foreign> in personal appearance, though she was still handsome and more
                  languishly silly than ever. She was always welcome at Burton House, because old
                  Manfred fancied all sorts of people, and he declared that Charlotte helped to make
                  up the variety. The rich relative from whose death she entertained her pecuniary
                  expectations, was still hale and hearty—though she looked for the good old lady's
                  demise, at some time or other, provided she didn't die before her!</p>
               <p>Noell and his daughters made an exceedingly good impression both upon Manfred's
                  family, and in the society they encountered. All the high contracting parties to
                  the approaching nuptials were now domiciled at the residence of Manfred, and it
                  was finally arranged that the two weddings—young Manfred with Hortense,<pb
                     n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5956-00000049"/> and Helen with Wilford, should take
                  place at Burton House.</p>
               <p>A fine old estate in the neighborhood was quietly purchased by Noell as a marriage
                  present to his daughter. It was forthwith renovated and refurnished in appropriate
                  style, and was christened De Brandt Hall, in honor of his wife's family name.</p>
               <p>"And this is the painter that was here some months ago? Is it not, Manfred?" asked
                  Miss Simplon, soon after reaching Burton House, and unexpectedly seeing Wilford in
                  the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is Wilford, the artist."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see," she continued. "I don't think he has improved much in his looks
                  since I saw him last. I hope he improves in his art."</p>
               <p>"He has done so, greatly, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"Well, there was need of it, verily."</p>
               <p>"I think he always possessed a goodly share of talent, for his age."</p>
               <p>"That is a matter of opinion, then."</p>
               <p>"Don't you think so, Charlotte?"</p>
               <p>"O he was so-so-ish, only. He wanted to paint my portrait, that is, he asked me to
                  sit for him two years ago—but I didn't think it worth my while, and I declined. He
                  remembers it, I think, for he hasn't spoken to me yet, since my arrival."</p>
               <p>"O you misappreciate him, I assure you. Come, do you know he is about to wed the
                  charming Nell Noell?"</p>
               <p>"I have not seen the lady yet. She has a queer taste. Is this Miss Noell as
                  wealthy as she is reputed, too?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, her expectations are large. Come, let me present you."</p>
               <p>The showy Miss Simplon was escorted across the drawing-room, and Manfred said:</p>
               <p>"Wilford, Miss Simplon. You remember her?"</p>
               <p>"Simplon—Simplon," said the artist. "Yes—yes. I recollect having seen the lady
                  before." He bowed, and turning to Hortense and her mother, he continued:</p>
               <p>"Now ladies, allow me."</p>
               <p>They each took an arm of his, and the trio immediately sauntered out upon the
                  terrace. Miss Simplon never took the slightest notice, apparently, of this cold
                  shoulder proceeding, but Wilford was avenged.</p>
               <p>A week afterwards, agreeably to arrangement, a splendid soiree was given at Burton
                  House, at the close of which the chaplain of the town appeared, and the lovers
                  were united in marriage. Agreeably with his promise, as the parties were about
                  entering the grand saloon where the ceremony was to be performed, young Manfred <choice>
                     <sic>aded</sic>
                     <corr/>
                  </choice> towards Nelly, and said:</p>
               <p>"You remember, Nell, when we left Beachy Head, after Wilford's recovery, that I
                  promised at your marriage to add a trifle to the gift I made your father at that
                  time?"</p>
               <p>Nelly had not forgotten this.</p>
               <p>"When I made that offer, I did not think you would be wedded at Burton House, and
                  that Wilford would be the bridegroom, surely. But here is the token; accept it—we
                  shall soon be related as brother and sister-in-law."</p>
               <p>A beautiful diamond necklace followed this remark, which Manfred had purchased for
                  the occasion, and which he now fastened about her well turned throat. It needed no
                  ornament, however. Nature had formed sweet Nelly in a mould of perfection!</p>
               <p>The newly wedded couples removed at once to De Brandt Hall, accompanied by Noell,
                  his retinue and his family. For several days after the region round about rang
                  with the music, the hilarity, and the joy attendant upon the event. And
                  notwithstanding the fact that the Manfreds did not find themselves eventually
                  connected in marriage with nobility, yet they were content with Hortense, who
                  proved a model of a wife and a charmingly companionable lady.</p>
               <p>The <choice>
                     <sic>diamong</sic>
                     <corr>diamond</corr>
                  </choice> ring which now graced the wedding finger of the fair Helen, and which it
                  will not be forgotten was Wilford's gift to her, at the moment of their first
                  parting, was originally the property of Wilford's mother; and the initials which
                  were engraved upon it, were those of his mother's maiden name. He had treasured
                  it, sacredly, up to the moment when he was about to leave the light-house, and
                  parted with it then, only because he had no other means save words, at that time,
                  of exhibiting to Nelly his appreciation of her kindness to him.</p>
               <p>A superb levee soon followed the two weddings. Noell was "happy enough for a
                  commoner," while Wilford was quite <unclear>as</unclear> "happy as a lord." The
                  circle of society into which the new comers found themselves introduced, was a
                  brilliant coterie of wealth, and beauty and fashion. And, long after these
                  fortunate nuptials, when the sparkling wine was brimming in the goblets at "De
                  Brandt Hall," the standing toast was, "<emph>Health and Happiness to Nell Noell,
                     the</emph> LIGHT-KEEPER'S TREASURE!"</p>
